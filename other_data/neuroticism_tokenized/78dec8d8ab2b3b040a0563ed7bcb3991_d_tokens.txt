< PROPMALE > Film Festivel is hands down amazing . So very sad that today is the last day . 
I learned something today . Film Noir is insanley fun to write . Working on a script for a short film now . 
I finished the first draft of the script script . \Russian Roulette\ " A Film Noir Story . " 
In SC . My parent's friends are great hosts . They have , literally , a library of films . I plan on watching < PROPFEMALE > Trek ... and < PROPFEMALE > Trek II ... and III ... and IV ... and V ... and < PROPFEMALE > . Me Trek-A-Thon starts tonight . Also , phone is lost , don't try to call me . 
I suffered through New < PROPFEMALE > . Really ? < PROPFEMALE > is one of the most shallow , weak , selfish , and manipulative characters I have ever seen . This film goes out of its way to say its like < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > and how dare it . Stuff like Titanic earned that , this did not . I also have never seen so many shirtless guys with 6-packs in a film . 
Happy Thanksgiving ! At this current time I have 4 hours and 15 minutes till the < PROPFIRST > Brown special ! 
Bad News : New < PROPFEMALE > has made a 1/4 of what Transformers 2 made in a single week Great News : It's < PROPMALE > Irizarry's birthday today ! If you don't know him , go to my friends list , find him , and wish him a happy birthday ! He is now officially 18 ! < PROPMALE > Irizarry 
Just finished writing my third and assuming last draft of Russian Roulette . Was a lot of fun but spaced things pretty wierdly on paper so what was 16 pages in notebook paper was only 8 1/10 pages officially . Overall , my first venture into film noir was a good one . 
I would walk all the way to California if it ment watching Austrian Death Machine live . Why aren't they bigger ? Who dare say that they wouldn't want to hear the Terminator be in a heavy metal band ? Who I ask ?! 
Doing French makes Will sad ... but watching < PROPMALE > Schwarzenegger act in Total Recall cheers me up ... his jaw moves and his voice makes noises only monkeys should be able to make . 
I'm getting ready to leave for Disney World for the rest of today for my mom's birthday . All wish her a happy birthday ! < PROPFEMALE > McCormac Wegner 
Tis the season to be joyous and happy / The colds winds are a blowing / The feel of christmas is upon us / As we come together in one way or another / Spreading the joy of this chirstmas season / Far and wide for the world to see / Our undying devotion to this happiest time of the year / < PROPFEMALE > christmas ! 
Avatar . Its not better then StarWars but it'll be the epic sci-fi of this generation . But I dislike the main message . I'm pretty sure everyone knows that white people were really bad to indians . I'm tired of films reminding me that my white ancestors were mean . I loved the film , hate the message behind it , but no matter , this is going to make alot of money . Despite all of this , I hope he makes two sequals . 
I'm in < PROPFEMALE > for christmas . Went through Philidelphia yesturday . Philly is a great city with the greatest Philly cheese steaks ever in history . I mean , they are nuclear greese balls that'll kill you by the time your 25 but my god are they good . Oh , and I ran up the museum steps ... twice . 
I have a computer again ! I have lost any and everything I had on it , just abut everything I've ever written but I've had time to come to terms with that . 
I just saw The World According to Garp for the first time . It literally took my breath away . I'm in shock about how great of a film it was . I didn't like it , I loved it . 
The Fighter , The Town , True Grit , Brooklyn's Finest , Youth in Revolt , Daybreakers , Repo Men , A Nightmare on Elm Street , Machete , Buried , Let Me In , My Soul to Take , Little Fockers , and Frozen were the 2010 films I wanted to see but missed and thus were not considered for my top films of the year . 
A Serious Man was a great film . Well , it was great until it simply ended out of nowhere . I love the Coen brother and I understand they have a style but the ending is inexcusable . You easily could have put in an extra half-hour but no , it just ends . Literally , questions unanswered and a tornado forming in front of a main character then cut to black . Did I miss something ? 
Wow . I studied from around 9 or 10am to 3:20 pm for exams . And I get to do it all over tomorrow . I still do not understand why we're having them now instead of before Christmas break , the logical ending to the 2nd quarter . But oh well . 
One day of exams done . Two more to go . My brain is tired . 
Exams are finally over ! The healing of the brain can begin ! < PROPFEMALE > t off with watching < PROPFEMALE > Trek again , then go out and see Book of < PROPMALE > , and best of all ... go to sleep and not wake up at 6am for three glorious days . 
Avatar has made 1.8 billion dollars now . There is no longer a single film in the history of cinema that can say that they made more money . We have spent more money watching a fun sci-fi retelling of the indian story/iraq story then any other film in history . Did it really deserve it ? 
I've now spent close to three hours trying to get Steam to work . If you know what the program Steam is , you know had bad this is . Its not going to work . 
Whoop ! Liverpool just got up to 4th place in the Premier League ! Just twelve more points to tie up with Manchester ! And if you don't watch Premier League and then don't worry , you're not supposed to understand . 
Four more days to my birthday ! Whoop ! 
Being sick sucks . Throat hurts , fever , tired , light-headed , and stuffy noes . Yay ( insert sarcasm ) . 
just got back from Casablanca . I saw it in theaters for the first time , fully un-remastered . I can easily say its one of the best films of all time but does it match Citizen Kane ? Not even close . 
now owns 100 films in his film collection . 
Should I be ashamed of enjoying 1980s Conan the Barbarian comic books ? Their so cheesy and over the top \sword and sorcery\ " yet its so much fun . " 
Disney's < PROPFEMALE > line-up is BS . what about < PROPFEMALE > Kida Nedakh ? From Atlantis The Lost Empire ? Atlantis was part of the Disney Classics line , just like the rest . Hell , even < PROPFEMALE > from Wonderland is in the line-up sometimes . What's wrong with Kida ? 
You know whats really addictive ? SimCity on the SNES 
Kick Ass was an amazing and fun film filled with the perfect blend of action , dark comedy , thriller and can fuse comedy perfectly into touching scenes . I love Kick Ass and if you're a fan of action movies , dark comedy , or/and comics then you need to see this movie . 
I am now the proud owner of an original printing of the following comics : Watchmen #1 , Batman : The Long Halloween #1 , and The Punisher #1 ( I just uploaded them ) . I now have the first issue of all my favorite comics ( DMZ , Batman : The Long Halloween , The Punisher , V for Vendetta , Watchmen ) except Hellblazer . Just need to find Hellblazer #1 and my collection will be complete . 
Peggle is one of the most addicting games ever . More addicting then Civilization 4 . 
29 days 1 hour and 50 minutes till FIFA 2010 . 
I , British-Football-Man (<PROPMALE>'s Only Superhero In History ) , command you all to check out Pop City Comics ! 
I bet that MacGruber will make $5 million to $7 million opening weekend . 7.5 tops . 
MacGruber has made $4.1 million so far . If it can make just make $ 900,000 today ( unday ) , i'll win ! Its sad to tihnk some people predicted MacGruber would make $15 million oepning weekend . 
Wow . I lost my bet on MacGruber . It didn't even make $5 million openign weekend and this was a massively advirtised movie predicted to make $15 million . Thank you movie-goers , thank you for having common sense . 
Everyone ! Remember your towel tomorrow for Towel Day ! \ 
Towel Day is a holiday that is celebrated in loving memory of < PROPMALE > Adams , famous writer of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series ! You celebrate by simply holding a towel all day , keeping it with you where you go for as we all know , a towel is the single most usefull thing in the galaxy ! 
I realized something , after watching the newest Doctor Who episode , is that its not < PROPMALE > Smith that i don't like . Its the scriptwrite because everything i've hated about the Elevnth Doctor episodes has almost nothing to do with < PROPMALE > Smith but its the writers . I blame < PROPMALE > Moffat and < PROPFIRST > Whithouse . Oh well , back to watching Tenth Doctor repeats . 
I FINALLY found something worse then Punisher : WarZone ! Something that is so bad in eevry aspect ! Something with terrible graphics and horrible musics scores ! Something with level design so bad that it would make the makers of Dark Sector shaked their head . Deadly Premonition on the Xbox360 is worse then Punisher : WarZone . Hell , its worse then E.T. The Video Game . 
Isn't it nice when you go to GameStop and buy a $20 game for your computer then go home , open it , and find out it has streaks and smudges before you even touch it . Then sit there , all damn night , trying to get it work and finally getting it to install all the way to 99% then have the last file be corrupt and have the whole thing undone . 
Well , to make up for Section 8 , I just got a perfectly working copy of Mega Man X on the SNES for $12 at Pop City . Pictures coming soon .... 
One day of exams down , two to go ... and 3 days , 2 hours till FIFA 
5 exams down . 2 to go . 2 Days , 39 Minutes till FIFA 
You know , ever since < PROPMALE > Ennis stopped writing for The Punisher , time from time I keep looking and hope the new writers are getting it . This has gone on FAR too long . < PROPFEMALE > has let The Punisher die a horrendous death . Let this be known , if i ever see < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > or < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > , I will kill you for the acts of inhumane treatment you've done to my fvaorite comic book character . You will pay , one day ! 
Another school year over , another summer to enjoy , all exams down , none to go . A sense peace in the air , i lay down my backpack for the last time and take it all in . My first year of high school done and over and now to look to the future and see what awaits . 23 hours till FIFA 
2 HOURS TILL FIFA 2010 BEGINS ! 
I'm confused now . The FIFA Opening Ceremony is over , we gotta wait till tomorrow before the first game , so why does the timer on the FIFA site say 8 minutes left till FIFA ? 
Wow . i have finally fallen . I am sad to say but i have a twitter ... https://twitter.com/RedConine 
Top 5 shows of all time : ( 1 . Doctor Who ) ( 2 . That 70s Show ) ( 3 . Castle ) ( 4 . < PROPFEMALE > Trek The Original Series ) ( 5 . Firefly ) 
* Top 5 shows of all \ 
time : ( 1 . Doctor Who ) ( 2 . That 70s Show ) ( 3 . Castle ) ( 4 . < PROPFEMALE > Trek The \ 
Original Series ) ( 5 . M*A*S*H ) 
Dark City is by far one of the most creative movies I've ever seen in my life . eXistenZ is an amazing mind-flipping movie that will keep you up but falls apart after a second viewing . Strange Days is < PROPFIRST>'s take on a genre almost entirley populated by low-budget idie film makers and its damn good . < PROPMALE>'s Ladder is an amazing balance of body horror and phycological horror . 
GO USA ! 1-0 ! THE < PROPMALE > REFS TRIED TO KEEP US DOWN BUT WE HAVE AND ALWAYS WILL OVERCOME ANYTHING IN FIFA ! GO USA ! 
Karate Kid was very good and it did a great job of updating , 8/10 . Now is as good as the original ? That really depends how you feel about the decade that the original one was made . It was a very good remake but I think the script was much longer then the finished product . 
Predators comes out July 9th . I don't care what stands in my way or where I'm at , I am going to see it opening day . No ammount of Wisconsin woods can stop me ! 
Yesturday , i spent the entire day in Chicago . Chicago is filled with < PROPMALE > museums , movie theaters , comic stores , old book stores ( basically everything I love ) . I want to live in Chicago so badly , from a first impression of the city . 
Heading towards the Rock N Roll musuem , can't wait to go but I did see Inception . Inception is , first reaction , a 9/10 and could have been even better but it has a really last-minute-thrown-in twist ending and the editing is horendous in some parts of the film . 
I am finally back in < PROPMALE > and there is ni parade , moose , platypyus , but I did see a few baloons so your all off this time but next time I better get something extra . Like two mooses or a platypus tied to a baloon . 
Just got home from Salt . Its the most surprisingly great movies of the year so far . It doesn't start out so but with so many twists and turns , its like if M . Night made a spy film back when he was a good director . It really was a thrill ride . 7.5 /10 
It's sad when you realize a game you've been waiting on for months , a game you've been dying to play , is actually out . You realize this 4 days after its been out . And that the \8\ " in the release date was actually 7 . I'm talking about the situation me not holding a copy of Starcraft 2 . " 
Playing through Doom 3 to distract myself from Starcraft II and you know what I've realized ? Doom 3 is a glorious rip off of Half-Life and some shitty horror elements . Seriously , its all the same or altered form of Half-Life . Half-Life + Doom Setting + Bad Horror Elements = Doom 3 
Just got done watching The Hulk ( 2003 ) for the first time in about 7 to 5 years . That film is a lot deeper and a lot better then people give credit for . Sure , its not really Hulk , its something much greater and deeper then a big green guy smashing stuff for 2 hours . Its a very different film that demands a lot but seriously . Give this film another shot and go in with a clear head . Its about a 7.5 /10 or a 8/10 
A 68-year-old film critic who says video games cannot be < PROPMALE > is as much a fool as a 34-year-old gamer who says film cannot be < PROPMALE > . < PROPMALE > is the expression of human creativity and imagination in pursuit of a goal . The goal can be anything , to entertain , to inform , to inspire . Paintings , music , films , plays , books , and video games all can be < PROPMALE > and in a way , all are . There is nothing that everyone in the world can enjoy 
After reading < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim ( the first three volumes ) , the movie does seem better . Its gone from 3.5 /10 to 5/10 in my book . The best part is that there's actual characterization for people besides < PROPFIRST > and more then 5 funny jokes . 
is watching Snoop Dog and < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > eat cornbread on live TV . 
You know you're a geek when your running Windows 3.1 in DOS on top of Windows XP . 
In preparation of seeing The Expendables tomorrow , I'll being watching : Terminator 2 , Die Hard , Rambo Part 2 , The Punisher ( 1980s ) , Sin City , The Transporter , and The One . See ya all in awhile . 
The more I've thought about < PROPMALE > Pilgrim , the better it seems . I take back what I've said , < PROPMALE > t Pilgrim vs . The World was great and that's because it reminded me what is a good romance and what isn't . 
is reading Little Brother by < PROPFIRST > Doctorow for summer reading . For the past 50 pages , its been about the US gov torturing a 17 year old kid because they think he's a terrorist . Saying its \liberal\ " is putting it nicely and \ " anti-homeland security/anti-American gov\ " is putting it bluntly . " 
Who else misses Mystery Science Theater 3000 ? 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > has throat cancer . What a perfect way to turn a great day into a depressing day . This just isn't right . 
Reading Little Brother is a painful experience . Would it have been too much for < PROPFIRST > Doctorow to assume his readers aren't complete idiots ? Could he have even tired to be subtle ? Could it have killed him to even ATTEMPT to show both sides ? 
< PROPFIRST > Doctorow is a crazy , political maniac , patriot act hater , hippie sympathizer , conspiracy theory madness , and a bad writer . Its like if < PROPMALE > Stone went crazy , lost his ability to write , and tried to write fiction after watching 1984 . 
Sorry for my rants but you'll be hearing a lot of me complaining about Little Brother for awhile . So , in advance , sorry for being really whiny . 
I just finished Little Brother . Its over . Its finally over . What I know is that I walk away from this book with a lot of my sanity left behind but all I know is that its finally over . 
All day has been a crime film marathon while doing random things . some of the highlights were S.W.A.T. ( a lot better then I remember ) and Pride and < PROPFEMALE > ( a personal favorite ) . Now I finish the day with Edge of Darkness and tomorrow begins my sophomore year . 
Fedoras = Awesome\ 
Thus , I proclaim tomorrow as Fedora Day . Everyone ! Wear a fedora tomorrow ! 
Fedora Day was a failure but there's always next year ! 
The ultimate pursuit of happiness is the pursuit of your passion . Everyone needs passion in their life , a dream , and without it , we're nothing . I'll be a great writer one day . What will you be ? 
< PROPFIRST > Wood ( who has written DMZ , DEMO , Channel Zero , and Northlanders ) is easily my favorite comic writer . Not that he's the best but he's my favorite . 
The Ghost Writer was an amazing and fantastic film . It was thrilling , smart , amazingly well written , great acting , good music , and beautiful cinematography . The film left me speechless . I'm gonna have to think about , but at this moment , I'd give it a 9/10 
Hell has officially frozen over . Now only is Duke Nukem Forever back in production but there are reports of tons of gamers at PAX playing a real demo of the game . \ 
\I just played 15 minutes of Duke Nukem Forever . I am dead fucking serious . I have proof . \ " - < PROPMALE > Antwiler " 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST>'s Why Did I Get Married Too is the most surprisingly good movie I've seen . I went in expecting an hour and a half of < PROPFIRST>'s comedy to pass the time and found a surprisingly well written drama that dissected marriage problems and life in general . Anyone who says < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > is a hack needs to watch Why Did I Get Married Too all the way to the end . 
I removed my last post because if I actually have to give you a reason for why burning a Qu'an or any piece of literature is bad , you're already lost . 
To John : If Duke Nukem Forever is , in my opinion after playing it , better then Half-Life 2 , I'll cosplay . 
The Last Exorcism was , very surprisingly , really good and maybe great ( not sure ) . I understand why people didn't like the ending , i do , but I personally loved it . Even if you didn't like it , the ending still makes sense and was hinted at . 7.5 /10 ( maybe 8 ) . Most surprisingly good movie of the year so far . 
The International is pretty good and , while the story does get crazy , its all done so well I didn't mind . The acting was good and the cinematography was AMAZING . Also , out of two action scenes , the shootout in the rotunda is one of the best shootouts I've ever seen in my life . At the core of it , The International has a sad message to tell the world but its just executed so well , you've gotta like it . 7.5 /10 
I'm pretty sure Vindictus is one of the best free to play game I've ever played and one of the best MMOs I've ever played . I've only played a few hours so I won't give it a rating yet but so far , it's looking pretty good . 
I never knew our legal system was so bureaucratic and full of shit . 
I hate spending 15 minutes trying to fit a thought and explanation into 420 characters and then getting fed up and saying screw it . Basic Thought without explanation : To read The Social Network's script alone and calling it terrible is just pissing on the entire crew of Social Network and proving your ignorance of film by judging a film ( visual medium ) as you would a novel ( non-visual medium ) . 
Imagine if someone made a silly , comedic , conspiracy theory non-terrorism Die Hard movie in 1991 . You'd basically get The Last Boy Scout . I'm pretty sure the director told < PROPMALE > \Act like your < PROPFIRST > McClane and you need a smoke 24/7 ! \ " . 6.5 /10 . The Last Boy Scout stars < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE > Wayans " 
I really wish everyone could forget that The Social Network is a movie about Facebook . Honestly , for the love of God , take one leap of faith this year . Go see The Social Network . Worst case scenario ? You don't like it but you've got something to talk about and proof that < PROPFIRST > Timberlake is actually a good actor ( I know , it shocked me as well ) . Just one leap of faith . 
$18 million of the $814 billion Stimulus was sent to dead people . $18 million was , basically , flushed down the toilet due to an error . \

Happy 70th Birthday < PROPFIRST > Lennon ! 
The Kinect - Congratulations Microsoft , you've made a product that is simultaneously dumber then NES R.O.B. robot and less functional then an Atari 5200 controller . 
Thank You For Smoking is a 8/10 . Its great , well written , and very well acted . The film surprisingly doesn't really take a side . It shows the evils of the Smoking Industry and of Anti-Smoking groups . The film is really about freedom of choice . However , I do believe < PROPFIRST > Eckhart is an amazing speaker . He is so charismatic and likable , even as he tells us that he helps kill nearly 12,000 men , women , and children a day 
Zodiac is an 8.5 /10 . Besides the great writing and directing , the film is one of the most horrifying of all . There is no suspension of disbelief . This all happened . The non-fiction book this was based one only has a couple of minor differences . That's what makes this film so terrifying , what we see really happened . The perfect crime was committed , multiple times , by the same man and his name is < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > . 
thanks a lot \A Clockwork Orange\ " . I'll never be able to listen to \ " I'm Singing In the Rain\ " ever again all because of you and < PROPMALE > McDowell . " 
For a game to be an RPG , it must have 5 things : Player Driven Character Building , Storytelling , Player Driven Roleplaying , Exploration , Strategy , Choice in Combat & in Non-Combat . For those of you like J-RPGs , how many J-RPGs can you think of that actually have all 5 of these things ? 
Today is a sad day . For the first time , in my comic history , < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > has written a comic that is not good . It's not really bad but its so meh , ending his streak of good to great comics . The comic is Astonishing X-Men Xenosaga #1 & #2 . I guess no writer can be perfect but < PROPFIRST > came close . 
I'm not a big fan of < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > but I have a lot of respect for the man . What really surprises me , however , is that he is the 2nd highest earning man in Hollywood ( < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > being 1st to no one's surprise ) . < PROPFIRST > Bay came in 3rd but was pretty close to < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > . 
Man first invented the wheel ! Man then invented sliced bread ! Man then invented sandwiches ! Man then invented < PROPMALE > Brando ! Then man invented THE WAFFLE MAKER ! 
Listening to orchestra music is one thing but actually seeing it live is an experience . There are few things as creatively pure and mathematically pure as seeing a local symphony , in this case the < PROPMALE > Philharmonic . 
The easiest way to get me into a sport is through a video game , examples being basketball and golf . So , I'm giving Baseball one shot to make me care about it . I just got MLB 2K10 on steam for $2 . One shot Baseball , you got one shot to make me care . 
The SAW series started out so well . The first movie was a really good thriller and a nice little dose of psychological elements . The second was just as good , arguably better , and was a great sequel . The third wasn't good but it did a good job of ending the series . After the third , everything just went to hell and got worse and worse . I'm honestly afraid to watch < PROPFEMALE > or 3D one because I can't imagine it getting worse . 
To the tons of people who like to rhetorically ask \Why is < PROPFEMALE > so dumb ? \ " Let me ask you this : What is the definition of dumb ? Is < PROPFEMALE > being dumb have something to do with them not agreeing with your opinions ? Could the mistakes < PROPFEMALE > makes be so obvious because you live here while mistakes in Britain and Canada can go unobserved by us ? Could it be possible for intellectual people to disagree with your views ? " 
I have some form of tonsillitis or strep ( probably and hopefully tonsillitis ) right in time for the film fest . To my body : Why do you hate me ? Is it because of Halloween ? I thought you'd be used to that by now . 
Lets see , I play video games , I read comic books , I read sci-fi and fantasy novels mostly , I'm a retrogamer , I've emulated Windows 3.1 on my computer , and know I love Dungeons & Dragons . Yup , it's official , I'm a nerd for life . 
Well , I felt well enough to go to the film fest and it was amazing . Besides seeing great film , I got to meet < PROPFEMALE > Hanson in a nearly empty theater for a lil ' bit . Being an idiot , I didn't take pictures before she had to go but I have < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Ruocco as my witness via telephone . Also , I watched a fascinating documentary on < PROPFIRST > Mailer . If you don't know who he is , I strongly recommend looking him up . 
Just watched Elm Street Part 2 . Great sequel and still scared the hell out of me . 7.5 /10 compared to the 1st Elm Street's 8/10 . time for A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 3 : Dream Warriors 
Elm Street Part 3 Dream Warriors was good but a very different . It be the transition between what I ; ve been told is serious < PROPMALE > and comedy < PROPMALE > . Either way , its a lot of fun but not too scary . 7/10 
Just watched Superman Returns for the first time since 2006 . Honestly , its not even close to being as bad as I remember it being ( kind like Ang < PROPFIRST>'s Hulk ) . Its still got plenty wrong with it but its an amazing Superman film with A LOT of symbolism my 11 year old mind missed . 7.5 /10 I'm happy there was never a sequel because its a story that really shouldn't have a sequel but its definitely underrated . 
HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO ALL ! NOW GOODNIGHT ! 
Olympic Development LLC ( a company you have never heard of ) is suing Microsoft , Sony , Nintendo , and Valve corporation over patent infringement . Who wants to take a bet its going to be settled out of court ? 
Just got done watching Inception on DVD . Its still a 9.5 /10 and one of my favorite films of all time . 
I am a casual-anti-anti-conformist , so I switched to the new profile . I suppose now I deal with it or kill my own profile with a blunt object . Either one . 
I have finally watched every < PROPMALE > Kueger movie ( besides the remake ) now and here is my list from best to worse of them : ( 1 . Nightmare on Elm Street ) ( 2 . < PROPMALE > Craven's New Nightmare ) ( 3 . Nightmare on Elm Street 2 ) ( 4 . Dream Warriors ) ( 5 . < PROPMALE>'s Dead ) ( 6 . < PROPMALE > vs . < PROPFIRST > ) ( 7 . Dream Master ) ( 8 . Dream Child ) Thanks you , < PROPFIRST > Bolin , for letting me barrow them for nearly 2 months . 
In Tron Legacy , we learn that milliseconds in the real world are hours in the grid . So < PROPFIRST > Flynn has been in the grid for what feels like 7,200,000 years ... hiding out ... with the girl , Quorra ... all alone with her ... I won't make any assumptions , I'm just stating what the movie says . ( Either way , Tron Legacy was still a great movie ) 
So , after getting into Minesota after a 5-hour drive that took 9-hours , I go to cut the first day of Wisconsin into a video . Turns out the program I tried to bring in my flash drive won't work on this laptop and Windows Movie Maker doesn't take MP4 files . So , it is impossible to release videos of Wisconsin unless I upload them one by one which is less then ideal . I'll have to cut them when I get home after Christmas . 
Guess who's home ?! 
RockMelt is my favorite browser . However , I have a suspicion that they stole my design ideas for a Facebook Browser but , oh well . 
PLEASE put this on your status if you know someone ( or are related to someone ) who has been eaten by dragons . Dragons are nearly unstoppable and , in case you didn't know , they can breathe fire . 93% of people won't copy and paste this , because they have already been eaten by dragons . 6% are sitting in the shower armed with fire extinguishers , and the remaining 1% are awesome and will repost . 
There is a constant critque of Tron Legacy thats been annoying : What were those random programs doing in the stands and running a bar ? It was established that this grid was supposed to one day hold humanity , thus there would be programs who's only directives would be to do human services or to fill the space and make the world more human-like . The story still isn't great but its an ignorant critque that was answered . 
I thought I had seen The Big Lebowski . I just got done watching it and I have no idea what I had thought i had seen . This was the first time I have ever seen The Big Lebowski and it was ... strange , funny , interesting , and just generally a crazy film in a great way . 7/10 
I have literally lost count the number of times the ending of the < PROPMALE > Potter series has been spoiled for me . Is it so hard to imagine that someone can be a fan of < PROPMALE > Potter and not have read the books ? 
To all the people who argue 3D is simply the 21st century's color , just the next step in the evolution of film , let me explain something to you : Color doesn't give me headaches ! No revolution in film has ever caused physical pain ( sound doesn't count because it sometimes causes pain when abused , 3D ALWAYS causes pain ) . Please let 3D die , I don't want to have to bring Tylenol to movie theaters every time I go . 
All < PROPMALE > Potter fans : Why the hell hasn't the time-machine ever been used since the the 3rd film/book ? Someone explain to me that after countless deaths of beloved characters , NO ONE THOUGHT TO USE THE TIME MACHINE-NECKLACE-THING ?! WOULD DUMBLEDORE DISAPPROVE IF THEY HAD SAVED FROM DEATH ?! < PROPMALE > POTTER FANS ! I DEMAND ANSWERS ! 
To everyone who told me Steelers would win hands down , meaning just about everyone at school , HA ! I TOLD YOU SO ! 
Now that I've seen ever < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > film and declaring him as one of my favorites , here is ... < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE>'s Top 6 Films : 6 . Rushmore ( 6.5 /10 ) 5 .

Am I the only one tired of the excessive loads of awkward-comedy in nearly every romance-comedy and most comedies in general now ? 
I'm kind of ashamed of myself for really liking a band called \Vampire Weekend\ " but damn their good ! " 
The Law of Reality : The less you think about something , the more said-something makes sense . 
There is something magical about watching a movie marathon in the background , working on a new script , getting 15 pages down without breaking a sweat , at midnight . Two films and 15 pages down , 4 movies and however many pages I can write to go . 
I'm sorry Death Proof but the greatest car < PROPMALE > is still \It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World\ " . You can't beat a 3hr epic comedy that is basically one < PROPMALE > scene with nearly every mode of transportation possible . " 
I feel bad for < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . It has to hurt to have your masterpiece that you've worked on for over a decade was beaten by a piece of oscar-bait schlock (<PROPMALE>'s Speech WAS a good movie but lets not kid ourselves , it was 100% old-school Hollywood < PROPFIRST > bait ) 
Bravo Academy , your shallow old-school hollywood love and fear of the new age knows no bounds . You truly are the house of the old and the few and shwocase , year after year , talent or quality have nothing to do with the Oscers . Bravo , Academy , bravo . 
Colombiana soda ; part Inca Kola , part Kola Champagne , part Secret Flavor , and it has a cream soda after taste . Its just like Hancock ; unfocused , flows badly , and is spread too thin . However , unlike Hancock , I enjoy Colombiana .

Plot hole in The Incredible Hulk ( 2008 ): When the Hulk and Abomination were fighting ; why didn't Iron Man at least attempt to do something ? The film establishes that it takes place after Iron Man so ... why ? Was he really too busy to stop a < PROPMALE > US city from getting leveled ? Oh this cross-over universe is going to cause so many issues ... 
What is the meaning of life ? Why do we need a meaning or fate or < PROPFEMALE > ? Could life be nothing more then chaos and amidst it all , must we seek innate purpose ? Perhaps there is no < PROPFEMALE > but choice . Amidst the chaos there is no greater plan for you or < PROPFEMALE > to control your endgame . Your future is your own domain , no fate or purpose , but whatever you make of life . There is no meaning of life ; just your ambition . 
I believe I have the only profile where my profile picture is Batman shooting a minigun , a status ago I was having a deep philosophical discussion on the necessity of the meaning of life , and a status before that I was defending < PROPMALE > Hex as a movie . I am weird . 
( 1/2 ) I have , in my hand , a pre-order receipt for Duke Nukem Forever : Balls of Steel Edition . Now , time to go join the first access club to play my exclusive pre-order demo but wait ; GameStop forgot to print my code on my receipt . The GameStop employee was < PROPFIRST > and is employee ID is 204199 . 
( 2/2 ) I do have are a very particular set of skills ; skills I have acquired over a very long career . Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you , < PROPFIRST > . If you give me my access code now , that'll be the end of it . I will not look for you , I will not pursue you . But if you don't , I will look for you , I will find you , and I will kill you . 
I have my pre-order for Duke Nukem Forever , I have an official release date for Prey 2 , Doom 4 is going to be officially announced this year , so now all I need is for Valve to announce a release date for HL2 : EP3 and life will be complete . 
Highlander Movie Marathon : Worst Idea Ever 
Am I the only one who misses the sitcom \Just Shoot Me ! \ " ? I guess the better question is if anyone remembers it . It had < PROPFIRST > Spade ? < PROPFIRST > Segal ? < PROPFEMALE > Malick ? Anyone ? " 
You know what I've learned ? If your going to sit down and write an essay for an hour to post on Facebook later , REMEMBER TO SAVE . A LOT . In case , you know , OpenOffice decides that it's bored and wants to screw with you . Just passing along some experience . 
Laying in bed with an Inca Kola , a new issue of DMZ and Hellblazer , and all my homework done = Heaven 
Some days , when I look outside , I look at the sweeping vista of humanity . I look into the world and see the all the hope and all the terror . I see the pessimistic that thwart yet I see the optimistic that praise . I see the world in all it's grander and suddenly its hard to care about the future of gaming or the politics of entertainment when its all just pebbles on the side of the twisting road that life takes us on . 
I have exactly 290 films . I still don't own 300 . Can you guess what my 300th film will be ?
