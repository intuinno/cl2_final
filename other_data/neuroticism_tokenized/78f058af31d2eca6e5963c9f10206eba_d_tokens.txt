Your time is limited , so don't waste it living someone else's life . Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking . Don't let the noise of other's opinions drown out your own inner voice . And most important , have the courage to follow your heart and intuition . They somehow already know what you truly want to become . Everything else is secondary . \

To be upset over what you don't have is to waste what you do have . \
