wishing to get well again 
As the banks fade dimmer away , \ 
As the stars come out , and the night-wind\ 
Brings up the stream\ 
Murmurs and scents of the infinite sea 
the sound of that makes everything better 
make the best in life , forget the past , todays here , and tomorow awaits 
A 9 hour wait for ( midnight ) Eclipse ... SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO worth it = !

Wondering what tomorow will bring along ..

When I'm standing top the bright lit city\ 
And I'll take your hand and pick you up\ 
And keep you there so you can see it \ 
As long as you're alive and care\ 
I promise I will take you there 
There is a wall that runs right through me\ 
Just like the city , I will never be joined\ 
What is this love ? Why can I never hold it ? ooo if only they were taught how to truly love ... 
I PROPOSE A WATER BALLOON FIGHT ! cause it is to demmmm hawt ! ah !

Until this past week i was not sure of just how much i could endure . but now i've found , with thanks to God , I'm stronger then i ever knew . Now i strive for a better beautiful life . My life is forever changed 
I hope i can share more memories with my new A.C.T.S family 
my wonderful new solution and treatment .. is God 
All I Can Do Is Smile <3 
I Now Have A Reason To Wake Up Every Morning , And Embrace Each Breath I Take . 
ah days are just better (: 
You're the Light in this darkness \ 
You're the Hope to the hopeless \ 
You're the Peace to the restless\ 
For greater things have yet to come \ 
And greater things are still to be done 
<3 \ 
I pray your < PROPFEMALE > shines\ 
through this doubting heart of mine\ 
so my world would know that , \ 
You are my strength\ 
You and You alone\ 
Keep bringin me back home\ 
<3 
Days just get more wonderful =) 
Time To Breathe In And Release 
You Don't Always Need To See Things , But Believe Their Always There 
You can break my branch in two , and < PROPFEMALE > all my leaves away , But i have roots stretched in the earth , for you see , they are the deepest part of me . 
You are my strength 
Things Will Always Turn Out .. Being Patient Is Key .. But Above All God . 
i miss my A . C . TS . family :( 
If only my life was back to age 6 , and i never cried when i fell but stood up and looked for more . 
I Have A Profound < PROPFEMALE > For Peace . And Discovered Again That It Is Not In The Abstract But In The Concrete That We Must Love . In The Concrete Love Is Not Sentiment But Challenging A Practical Matter . 
not even my headache can ruin my day :) 
being sick blows :( 
and then i see all of you and there is no more pain =) ((( a.c.t.s. family ))) 
You Give Me Strength When All I Could Do Is Face The Ground , Let The Fire Burn Deep In My Heart And Soul <3 
I’m all right but I can’t lie\ 
\ 
Sometimes I feel like giving \ 
But I know in the end\ 
I’ll make it through\ 
If I stand next to You\ 
So here I am 
You give me hope in-spite of everything . \ 
You show me love even with so much pain . So I'll take this life and live like I was given another try . 
Sometimes i feel like giving up but in the end i know ill make it through 
Everyone just needs to BREATHE ! 
Not looking forward to tomorow for once :( 
So far today was pretty decent =) thank you God for being with me <3 
Everything will turn out =) 
haha lifeteen family check my photos =) \ 
love you guys 
today was great =) 
Our Souls Are One If \ 
You Must Know And Never Shall They Be Apart . When Splendid < PROPFEMALE > Your \ 
Face Aglow , I Reach For You And Find My Heart 
I Close My Eyes And Listen ... Again I Hear Nothing 
There's a wave that's crashing over me\ 
And all I can do is surrender 
the absence of I . 
something that will never happen ... is exhausting 
the dream ... that made me think .. ah everything will be okay 
take just a little time and try to understand , \ 
That there's more going on , \ 
Than what these eyes can see . \ 
I\ 
know it all seems complicated , \ 
There's nothing more that could be \ 
stated , \ 
NOW is the time to Reach out to what is real 
he smiles ... and there's no more pain 
Overwhelmed with pure Happiness 
My love is such that rivers cannot quench 
uhh studying reeeeks 
Note to self : For fast-acting relief , try slowing down . 
If i just lay here .. would u lie with me and just forget the world 
breathless .... 
it shouldn't be this hard to breathe :))) 
if only the world could stop for just one moment 
Note to Self : Rebel and Strive for what makes me happy 
SURRENDER ! 
uhh so stressed .. :( 
My Heart Is Restless Until It Rests In You 
If We Cannot Love And Live In Peace With Individuals We See Everyday , How Can We As A Nation Possibly Ever Love And Live In Peace With Each Other ? 
When My World Is Shaking Heaven Stands , When My Heart Is Breaking I Never Leave Your Hands .. One Day You Will Set All Things Right 
What happens now .. 
I know that you could break my branch in two , but i have roots stretched in the earth that will withstand wind and fire 
I know you hate to see me cry\ 
One day you will set all things right\ 
When my world is shaking , \ 
Heaven stands\ 
When my heart is breaking \ 
I never leave your hands 
Everything Will Be Alright . As Long As Your By My Side . 
Ah Just To See You Smile 
Everything will be Alright :) 
yey !! boxing 
la nuit dernière était incroyable , aujourd'hui sera < PROPFEMALE > autre jour extravagant <3 \ 
[[ last night was amazing , today will be another extravagant day ]] 
strive for your happiness 
Can't wait to see a brand new day :) 
Slow down and everything you are chasing will come around and catch you 
Cant wait till Saturday <3 
Ah if i could only lay here and look up at the sky 
Today's gonna be great =) !!! 
aaah !! (( YOUNG CHIN))\ 
haha to johnny :D !! 
why cant everyone slow down :( 
Welcome to resistance\ 
The tension is here 
The tension is here\ 
I dare you to lift yourself up off the floor\ 
I dare you to move 
spoons !!! best night ever ! 
Look at the stars .. \ 
Look how they shine for You . 
hoping for things to get better =( 
yup ... \ 
nothing's getting better :( 
i hope its not an illusion 
here we go again =/ 
just waiting for that moment to come is exhausting 
convinced that you'll never open your eyes to look into mine 
mm if only .. 
why cant things get better :(( 
Oop oop this is cool I'm on crystals new blueberry curve !! Ah 
spin , rah , blah , blah , blah 
But once you see a world that’s in need\ 
And a sorrow you just can’t ignore\ 
Your heart’s gonna break and you’ll lay awake\ 
Cause you’ll know you could do so much more 
To relax and rewind 
please be my strength 
Slow down .. \ 
and look at what you have . \ 
you never know how much they meant to you till their gone . \ 
so love and live to the fullest 
Slow down .. and look at what you have . you never know how much they meant to you till their gone.so love and live to the fullest 
It's times like these . You learn to live again 
My life was once meaningless and sad , \ 
until god sent all of you my way , \ 
Now my life is full of joy and laughter , \ 
everything has meaning now that your in my life . \ 
[ crystal , johnny , maria , steve , nathan , mia , claudia ] 
the less you have the more humble you will be 
I miss when fun defined playing duck duck goose 
Let it be 5 o'clock already ! :( 
In this life I know what I’ve been But here in your arms I know what I am 
please be my strength , because i dont have anymore 
Back to reality =/ 
eh nothing to look forward to =/ 
once again . \ 
things are bad . \ 
nothhing new 
He promises a happy end\ 
I pray that you will hold my hand\ 
And teach me to be who I am in you 
teach me to be who I am in you 
Days will come when you don't have the strength \ 
And all you hear is you're not worth anything\ 
Praying that you have the heart to fight \ 
because you are more than what is hurting you tonight 
Who will love me for me\ 
Not for what I have done or what I will become\ 
‘Cause nobody has shown me what love\ 
who will love me for ME 
‘Cause nobody has shown me what love really means 
You only live today once , yesterday wont come back . \ 
So live it well , Love who hurt you , Love who Loves you . \ 
And Surrender your heart . 
I am trying to understand how to walk this weary land . \ 
One day you will set all things right 
From the shadows , From the wrong roads\ 
From the darkness , From the unknown\ 
To redemption , Something beautiful 
Another day all i can hope for is the best 
Before its too late ... 
Lead me with strong hands\ 
Stand up when I can't\ 
Give me the strength\ 
To be everything I am called to be\ 
I'll show them I'm willing to fight\ 
And give them the best of my life\ 
Today's another day :) make the best 
let the good sink in :) 
All my life I have seen where you've taken me\ 
Beyond all I have hoped and there's more left unseen\ 
There's not much I can do to repay all you've done so I give my hands to use\ 
_To bring happiness to someones life_ 
Let's Put A Smile On That Face !! :D 
I cant help it !!! :) ! \ 
Embrace this year for its coming to an end and will never come back so love and live it slowly everyday . 
#248 : your the one who i cant wait to see .. the one who brings a smile to my face . \ 
I wish i could tell you everyday how much i love you and how worthy you are in this world . You bring happiness to everyones life , but your especially the light of my life and you are my heart and soul ! \

Making the best of today

You are the strength that keeps me walking , \ 
the hope that keeps me trusting , \ 
the light to my soul\ 
You are my purpose . \ 
How can I stand here with You and not be moved by You ? \ 
Would You tell me , how could it be any better than this ? 
Let the Fire Burn , Hold Me and Keep me Strong 
And every time you look at me\ 
I’m spinning like an autumn leaf\ 
Bound to hit bottom sometime 
Just Let Me Hold You , And Forget The Rest . 
then I see Your Smile . \ 
and There is no more pain <3 
If it wasnt for you , I wouldnt be here today 
There is more to life than we think 
Whom Shall I Fear , I Am Yours . 
Life Is Not Measured By The Number Of Breaths We Take , But By The Moments That Take Our Breath Away <3

All That I Am , \ 
All That I Ever Was , \ 
Is Here In Your Perfect Eyes , \ 
There All I Can See . 
Hope rises with the sun

Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance

what I've become\ 
What have I become ? \ 
My love never ends . \ 
It never ends . \ " , 2011-01-16 01:38:46 " 
in a place where love can't die 
wake me up inside , call my name as save me from the dark 
Oh :) that smile , i just adore :) 
The sun always rises 
Because I could not stop for Death\ 
He kindly stopped for me 
there's something about you \ 
I can't quite figure out\ 
everything he does is right\ 
and it's you and me and all of the people\ 
and I don't know why\ 
I can't keep my eyes off of you 
Like sunlight burning at midnight\ 
Making my life something so\ 
Beautiful , beautiful 
Shine your grace over me :( 
God , I trust You . 
What's On Your Mind ?? 
what a lame day =/ 
Makes me think ... :( 
crystal+me+photobooth = hilarious LOL !!!!! =D 
just to see u smile after so many days :))) 
the most amazing thing is to hear your voice =) 
To steal you from your grey world .. i'd do 
I hope you are at ease , just know i'm praying \ 
Always , \ 
to keep your head held up 
Nothing better than this ... =) 
im always thinking about you :) \ 
As you breath out , and i breath in 
Sinking into sweet uncertainty\ 
I'm spinning free :)

ah .... that smile 
ah ... that smile of grace and lightness\ 
With fonder hope to always see those sweet eyes\ 
yes its you :) 
Your love is enough to light up the darkness in me 
In the end ... YOU WILL realize how strong you are 
Why do we all feel that we must follow what everyone does ! My theory is that we all should be Our Own Individual self , Be Independent , And make a change , BE THE CHANGE . 
puzzled :/ 
Everything's going to be Alright :) 
Please be my strength 
That beauty within your heart\ 
You are perfect just the way they are\ 
There could never be a more beautiful you

With God anything can be done 
Today's Going To Be Great 
Hope means holding on to you\ 
Grace means you’re holding me too 
Give us more than words to speak\ 
Cause we are hearts and arms that reach 
Sing me a love song :) 
Oh my dear , I'll keep you in my arms tonight 
Of all that I've done wrong\ 
And everything that you have done\ 
To make it right 
A glorious light beyond all compare\ 
there will be an end to these troubles \ 
But until that day comes i will seek God through it all 
Hold my heart :( 
everything will fall into place 
errr .... nothing to do for once
