I trimmed my friend list to 309 . Maybe I should have gone for the bare minimum - less than 75 . It would be pretty easy . 
Drive carefully ! Everyone else on the road drives just as well as you .

I looked at my profile for the first time in ages . It says that I'm interested in women and men . I thought that my account had glitched . Then , I remembered that I set it up that way because my \looking for\ " section has \ " friendship\ " and \ " networking\ " instead of \ " dating\ " and \ " a relationship\ " . Heh ... " 
Oh , yeah . I was on my way to my car last night when I saw this huge moving light in the sky . It freaked me out . Then , I remembered that there was supposed to be a meteor shower .

The particles split up and burn in the atmosphere , making the streaks that we see . :/ Something like that ...
