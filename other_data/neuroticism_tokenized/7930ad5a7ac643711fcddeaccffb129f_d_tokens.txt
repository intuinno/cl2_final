So often , we believe that we have come to a place that is void of hope and void of possibilities , only to find that it is the very hopelessness that allows us to hit bottom , give up our illusion of control , turn it over , and ask for help . Out of the ashes of our hopelessness comes the fire of our hope . 
Damn you Clinique .... Damn you to the Unholy Depths of HELL ... 
Exhausted ... going to bed . What a day . 
Watching mentalist tonight to see one of my Theatre buds on TV .. Whoo hoo .

Remembering who I am 
here's some advice . When you smell like rotting tuna , milk , and a yeast infection all rolled in one . MAYBE ... just maybe you should think about taking a shower and not standing in line at a bookstore with in a sleeve less t-shirt with your armpits exposed to the masses . Okay .
