Love means to commit oneself without guarantee , to give oneself completely in the hope that our love will produce love in the loved person . Love is an act of faith , and whoever is of little faith is also of little love .

If I had one wish , we would be best friends\ 
Love would never end , it would just begin\ 
If I had one wish , you would be my boo\ 
Promise to love you , trust me I'll trust you\ 
If I had one wish , we would run away\ 
Making love all day , have us a baby\ 
If I had one wish , I'd make you my whole life\ 
And you'd be my wife , make it right this time 
life is full of money , material items , entertainment , or the so called \pursuit of happiness\ " but what is life without true love ? some people say they are \ " unlovable\ " but everyone is lovable just doubt themself instead of staying optimistic . instead of thinking about what ur crappy life will bring u next dont think so hard its only literally just around the corner :) " 
When you see my face \ 
Hope it gives you hell\ 
When you walk my way \ 
If you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well\ 
Then he's a fool , your just as well , hope it gives you hell

Didnt sleep very well last night 530 to 800 is not a good sleeping schedule XD anyways looking forward to a better day :) 
Poker ... wat an interesting game 
Im not a little kid anymore i dont have the energy i used too XD these kids are wearing me out ! 
You give this girl a drank and she is your's and your friends fo da night ..... damn dude thats cold 
not in the mood to finish my english essay XD 
Why is it when things are so right they still seem to be so damn hard .... 
Post this if you know/are related to someone who suffers from being a < PROPFIRST > Cowboys Fan . Being a Cowboy Fan is a REAL disorder and should be taken seriously ! There is still no known cure for DCF & sympathy does NOT help . We CAN raise awareness ! 90% of Cowboy Fans won't repost this because they don't know how to copy and paste ... \ 
\ 
I'm just sayin my dads a < PROPFIRST > fan and im totally rubbing it in his FACE !!!!! 
great day planned ahead :) bowling with < PROPFEMALE > then the mall and a movie ! considering buying a new game or some nice sleep pants ugh decision decision decisions warmness or epicness i just cant choose !!!!! haha 
okay so girls cross country ran at 10 and guys at 1045 anybody wanna tell me how they did ???? 
omg seriously its been all day and nobody posts on facebook how NW did at state for cross country how depressing :( did it go that bad ? 
LIKE OMG GLEE IS TOTALLY ON TONIGHT .... wait i just got black ops .... what a dilemma ! :D 
If you see a veteran today take the time and shake his or her hand they surely deserve a little thanks ! :D 
1015 at night a gameinformer my computer and nothing to eat or should i say not able to eat XD ( life of a wrestler and his weight sucks ) ... boy i hate restless nights XD 
takedown tournament today 3 wins no loses . scores : 8-2 , 15-0 , 8-0 not a bad start 
i hatre sickness ..... i have a fever sore throat and i cant breath out my nose XD 
POKE WAR DECLARED AGAINST < PROPFEMALE > Hickman ! 
I don't know what it was but i just had a mood swing ... 
not something to really brag about but im happy . ran 7 1/2 < PROPMALE > in 55 < PROPFEMALE > . If my calculations are correct that 7:20 a mile its decent for a non-runner like me . also my scale reads to me 104 pounds im so close to getting down to weight for wrestling . waking up at 5 to run some more wonder how much i can really do . 
I've come to the conclusion that some well MOST people are allergic to hard work 
Just got done workin out with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > . we going to some place on post tomorrow . we gotta be down to weight by tuesday to make the team better . What's a good way to get rid of joint pain in your legs ? 
I MADE IT HAHA ! i got down to 102.9 today I'm finally under 103 . First matches tomorrow against McGavock , Hume Fogg , and West Creek . Looking to come out on top :) 
won all 3 matches today wrestled up to 112 and I'm looking great and clean . It was a fight though my face is messed up haha :) 2nd match was forfiet 3rd match pinned guy in a little over a < PROPFEMALE > . 
Just got done working out and on the way home saw smitty running with these leopard print arm things on it was funny . 
Do you not look in the mirror when you get dressed in the morning ? No you cant cause you broke it ! < PROPFEMALE > Hickman :) 
I'm scared of even the possibilities of losing . whether it's 1% or 100% . Night before matches are always the most restless . Even with complete confidence how can i be scared ? A famous president once said thing only thing you have to fear is fear itself but what if he lied ? Is there more than just fear ? I don't know , but i have a feeling this will be a long night .... 
Making weight sucks but completly worth it 10 < PROPFEMALE > till end of class . Then < PROPFEMALE > d shift to wrestling . 
for the team it was a little disappointing getting our faces smashed by franklin .... BUT i won both my matches i am currently 5-0 and still rollin strong . 
came out of practice 103.0 get to eat a sandwich tonight :D i hurt my elbow though just a little sore . 
officially 7-0 got a good match today forfiet then a pin . cant wait for saturday at harpeth invitational hoping to get first :) 
Love waking up at 4 to leave for tournament at 515 in the morning . Smells like wrestling season ! 
Im 2-0 at todays tournament and im in the finals . 1 pin in 31 secs and the other in 24 secs . 1st place here i come !!! 9-0 overall right now . 
Guess who got first at harpeth ! THIS GUY DID !!! 
< PROPMALE > Roberts is 1 0-0 And the harpeth invitational 103 pound champion . Thursday we have Rossview , Cheatham , and Glencliff and Saturday is Clarksville High Slamfest . Till then I'm hungry haha 
I'm curious haha . i wanna play this number game so go ahead send me some < PROPFIRST > haha ill comment back as needed . thanks :) 
A normal person has 1000 wishes . A Soldier only has one , to come home safe . I\

I am leaving tomorrow morning/afternoon for New Jersey and i wont be back till friday night or saturday morning . If you wanna txt me while im gone go ahead 931-217-1965 .

It's wrong to ever split an infinitive ~ Woody Paige ~ 
Told myself go to sleep ...... I didnt listen and hopped on facebook haha 
EVERYONE SHOULD POKE ME ! 
24-0 is what < PROPMALE > Roberts . Had to stop one match cause the other kid had ring worm XD i wanted to finish that match . 
I'm tired of feeling like crappp !!!! 
Glad i have a few days to rest from wrestling my body is physically beat up XD Sometimes i ask myself if it's worth it . then i see the guys head about to pop off while im pinning him and go Hell ya ! :) 
Why does my phone hate me and not wanna send messages !!!!!!! 
You know what really grinds my gears ???? YOU < PROPFEMALE > F*CK YOU !!! Back to you < PROPMALE > . 
I once knew a fellow named Urchin \

Home wrestling match tomorrow . We go against West Creek and Montgomery Central . Let's see that viking support in the stands :) No fights this time ? 
To all friends : Don't poke me if you don't want to be poked back :D 
confused . Poll time . What should i do ? Marines or college ? or college through marines ? I'm lost ... 
Questions and answers ? \ 
Can you have light without dark ? \ 
Can you have good without evil ? \ 
Can god exist without satan ? \ 
Are we born evil or good ? or niether and we grow good or evil ? \ 
Discussions are greatful . 
If Hancock can't die , does he need to breath ? Movie is on TV and it struck my mind . 
Cowards die many times before their deaths - < PROPMALE > Caesar- 
hmmmm i have a big feeling we wont have school tomorrow . 
Can't sleep . Matches tomorrow decide if we go through < PROPFEMALE > or fail through failure . So tonight nothing matters ..... I'll just sit here and work out a little how does 1000 crutches and 500 push-ups sound ? 
Can't be more mad at the referee from the Dickson match , We lost that match cause of him . Senior and never got to go to state with my team ..... Biggest devastation ever ...... 
You have no friends if your only vent is facebook :P 
Hate nights when i cant sleep :( 
Hate nights when i cant sleep >.< save me from this restlessness . 
UGH UGH UGH ...... all the words required . 
< PROPFEMALE > was right . I think I have strep XD Probably won't be in school tomorrow ...

The last two days of my life i've had state practice at CHS . Yesterday I felt terrible , today I pushed myself even harder and feel like I can take on the world . I don't know about you , but I'm ready to wrestle Thursday , Friday AND Saturday . You want to take me down you gotta get past my hands first . Let's see you try . 
First time on Facebook in two weeks . Oh , how I miss the internet . Oh well I get over it as usual . I feel like things are better now . 
Stopped by < PROPFEMALE > recruiters office today . I ship at the beginning of september . Guess it's time to start the adult life ???
