Started Facebook . Must add friends . 

excited for tomorrow . I mean ... im excited for today . 
With BSU whoopin Oregon , BYU outlasting Oklahoma , Ohio St. barely able to < PROPFEMALE > on against Navy , and Iowa barely edging out Northern Iowa , The bcs system is looking pretty ridiculous right about now . 
It haunts my dreams . http://www.metro.co.uk/weird/article.html?Gollum-like_monster_emerges_from_Panama_lake&in_article_id=739578&in_page_id=2 
How bout them cowboys ? 
Is it April 1st ? I never thought i would empathize with < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > . 
After many political arguements i've finally figured out why some will never see eye to eye : A lack of any belief in free agency . That people are to be forced to do what is right . I just simply dont believe in anything that forces another human being to sacrifice anything they dont want to . 
so ronery . 
You stay classy U of Florida . 
Oh how I hate NBC . Reporting live from the Berlin Wall NBC's < PROPMALE > Brokaw , on Monday's Today show , never once mentioned < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE>'s name and his role in helping to end the Cold War , but did find time to praise Mikhail Gorbachev . 
I would post a question . But i dont believe anyone would be open for discussion . Which leads me to my point ... you all suck . 
\If you analyze it I believe the very heart and soul of conservatism is libertarianism . \ " - < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > " 
School choice ? Not in D.C. 
This is what happens when BCS teams play with a buttered up schedule and then play a real contender . 
Imagine that : Being pleasantly surprised by an Obama speech . 
As if we weren't already contemplating taking Goomba to the pound , he had to go and scratch the inside of my eyelid . 
I dont know if i like seeing tiger woods at the \rehab\ " clinic first thing when i turn on my xbox . " 
I remember how much i liked Advent Rising . A planned trilogy that will never get past the first game :( 
Obama asking for 9 billion more dollars to go towards the Nuclear armament programs . Im not disappointed or satisfied , Just confused . 
BLACK DYNAMITE !!! 
If you have a cat in your house , you also have a box of crap in your house . 
Patriot Act renews again , but there are no streets filled with protesters or news stories about how its trampling human rights . I wonder why its not such a bad thing \this time \"." 
If your cat were just a little bit bigger , it would kill and eat you . 
We'll see what happens . 
Idaho , Texas , Alabama , Florida , South < PROPFEMALE > , Nebraska , North and South < PROPFEMALE > , Pennsylvania , Utah and Washington so far . 
My health insurance costs about $400/month . I hear the penalty for not having insurance is about $750/year . Since I'm in good health now , I figure I can dump my policy and pay the fine . And since there's no more preexisting condition policy i can wait untill i get sick to reacquire insurance . What a great deal ! I'll save $ 4,000 a year . Thanks all my liberal friends ! 
\The harsh fact of the matter is when you’re going to pass legislation that will cover 300 [ million ] American people in different ways it takes a long time to do the necessary administrative steps that have to be taken to put the legislation together to control the people . \ " - Rep. < PROPFIRST > Dingell ( D-MI ) defending the health < PROPMALE >." 
Hey , your racism is in my health < PROPMALE > . Pages 405 , 882 , 885 , 890 , 909 , and 924 of the health < PROPMALE > . 
Many conservatives say Obama has no < PROPMALE > in 2012 . But what if the Comprehensive Immigration Reform < PROPMALE > is passed ? Some Liberals and most democrats have pushed for quite a few years on this . In 2000 there was an estimated 13 million illegals in the US , over 20 million in 2005 . Based on the continued increase would it be fair to say that Obama has the potential to add 30 million supporters to his re election ? 
Federal raid in Michigan on a \christan militia group\ " . Good to see the good ol ' Patriot Act being used to arrest individuals whose only crimes were using their second amendment rights . " 
Say what you will about Obama -- and I've said a lot , none of it flattering -- but the man has pretty much given the CIA free reign to kill members of < PROPMALE > Qaeda . For that , he should be thanked . 
When three people connected to the U.S. consulate in Mexico were ambushed and brutally murdered , many claimed inconvenience and that it was just plain bad luck despite the two seperate instances . Now with the bombing of the U.S. consulate in Mexico , will we continue to turn a blind eye to the obvious targeting of Americans ? 
Anyone wanna guess how much General Electric payed in Taxes ? 
I loved the \Horrible Histories\ " book series as a kid and I still do . " 
It's been over a week since i last saw my wallet , i miss him . 
But < PROPMALE > Nebuchadnezzar , the fire is too hot . 
I enlist Friday 
“Any health care funding plan that is just equitable civilized and humane must , must redistribute wealth from the richer among us to the poorer and the less fortunate . Excellent health care is by definition redistributional . ” - < PROPFIRST > Berwick , President Obama’s nominee as the head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) , gives speech in Britain , 2008 . 
So excited for tomorrow : < PROPFEMALE>'s graduation ceremonies , Idaho Gun Show Expo , < PROPFIRST > Hood at Edwards . 
The world's most popular sport ? Please . This is like saying that dirt is more popular than gold simply because there is more of it . Last time I checked , soccer was very popular where starvation , archery , and badminton were the alternative activities . Where soccer has to compete with the NFL , college football , and basketball -- not to mention WWE , the X Games , cheerleading contests , and cage-fighting -- not so much . 
I guess if someone's gonna come out and bash FIFA's allowance of such blatant acting it would have to be the US . It's practically in everyone else's game plan . 
New life goal added . Eat at The Heart Attack Grill in Chandler , Arizona . 
FEDOR LOSES ! I'm so happy . 
Spain : The sloppiest team to ever win a world cup . 
is thrilled that Future Weapons Season 3 finally came out on netflix . 
Let us walk through the new immigration labyrinth : 
It's all so predictable . The more frustrating the obstacles the government puts in the way of businesses , the more some will come crawling to the government for bailouts , the more that firms will bow to the government's agenda and become politically intertwined . 
Geography Quiz : What world location is described below ? \ 
\We have armed paramilitary squad-sized elements coming through ... every day and every night . \ " \ 
Attack of the Nanny State : Mothers , teachers , doctors , and church members are meeting their dealers in barns and on back doorsteps , paying cash for an illicit substance they say they just can’t live without : raw milk . \ 
Yes , that’s right , milk – unpasteurized , nonhomogenized , raw milk . It’s illegal to sell for human consumption in North < PROPFEMALE > and 24 other states . 
I used to not really care about Tebow . Everybody seems to rag on him and want him to fail in the NFL . All the unnecessary hate has turned me into a Tebow fan . I hope he does well with the Broncos . 
Cant find my copy of Gladiator ... so disappointed in myself . 
So excited for fantasy football .

People who watch NCIS have low IQ's . It's science . 
Green Bay ! 
A fine is a tax for doing wrong . A tax is a fine for doing well . 
For Dinner I had a cheeseburger with Bacon ... and peanut butter . 
I love it when a couple dirtbag airmen download torrents all day and ruin the internet for a few hundred others . 
The Democrats’ two years of control delivered zero social liberalism . Disappointed . 
I miss home .

Watched the crazies ... i hate my roommate for renting it . 
Pocket Bacon , Totally Useless .
