“To me , there are three things we all should do every day . We should do this every day of our lives . Number one is laugh . You should laugh every day . Number two is think . You should spend some time in thought . And number three is , you should have your emotions moved to tears , could be happiness or joy . But think about it . If you laugh , you think , and you cry , that's a full day . That's a heck of a day . You do that seven days a week , you're going to have something special . ” - < PROPMALE > Valvano

“You can’t connect the dots looking forward ; you can only connect them looking backwards . So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future . You have to trust in something — your gut , < PROPFEMALE > , life , < PROPFEMALE > , whatever . This approach has never let me down , and it has made all the difference in my life . ” - < PROPMALE > Jobs 
“I believe that the very purpose of life is to be happy . From the very core of our being , we < PROPFEMALE > contentment . In my own limited experience I have found that the more we care for the happiness of others , the greater is our own sense of well-being . Cultivating a close , warmhearted feeling for others automatically puts the mind at ease . It helps remove whatever fears or insecurities we may have and gives us the strength to cope with any obstacles we encounter . It is the principal source of success in life . Since we are not solely material creatures , it is a mistake to place all our hopes for happiness on external development alone . The key is to develop inner peace . ” - Dalai Lama 
Courtesies of a small and trivial character are the ones which strike deepest in the grateful and appreciating heart . - < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE >
