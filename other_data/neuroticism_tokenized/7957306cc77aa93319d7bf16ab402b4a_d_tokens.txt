Arts and crafts are the funnist early in the morning when the whole world is green and yellow cause the sun is fresh and awake and all you hear is coffee brewing , birds chirping , and the sounds of your quiet house sleeping . <3 
PASCALE DON'T FORGET ABOUT ME !!! D: 
Toy Story 3 made me cry !!!! two thumbs up !!!! my new favorite 
I wish I was still at jazz camp deep in the < PROPMALE > . No contact with the outside world . Trapped in a surreal dream . Then it ended ... :( 
I'm pretty sure I want to move to Cali . 
SCRAPBOOKING !!!! 
I HATE JUMBO GIGANTIC FUZZY SPIDERS !!!... Big&Sexy hair spray is good for something . This world needs more dead spiders and more big hair . 
I LOST MY FAKEBOOK !! :( 
Architecture and flowers ? I don't understand the prompt :/ 
Friday nights are always way more fun than saturday nights . Why ? 
I FOUND MY FAKEBOOK !!! :D 
My ears are tingling and I fear they might just melt off . 
I think I killed the mother of all JUMBO GIGANTIC FUZZY SPIDERS in my room with my * Big & Sexy * hairspray the other night ... it's children are fighting back .. THEY ARE EVERYWHERE * wimper * :( i was doing laundry and one crawled up my arm ): 
Hear No Evil \

whatever time it is now , subtract for from it , and thats officially how long it take's sekayi to put together a bookshelf . 4 hours . ( i kept < PROPFEMALE > screwing the nails cause i was mixing up my right and left hand ): ... too late 
Blue door ... exciting .... hahahaha . \ 
talk about a train reck . ( not for fara , she was great ) 
Children with special needs don't have an illness , so they are not contagious . They want what we all want , which is to be accepted . Most of you probably won't copy and paste this . But will you do it and leave it on your status for at least one hour ? It's special education week .... and ... this is in honor of all the kids who need a little extra help and understanding 
I love making friends ! :D 
Even castles made of sand , fall into the sea , eventually . 
I feel poking someone is a great option when you just don't know what to say ... Facebook is genius . 
has been bitten by a spider . Not just any spider , a big spider . A very large dark and fuzzy spider in my room . ( I sware it's a spider breeding ground in my bedroom , I didn't think they would actually attact me .. but I THOUGHT WRONG ! ) 
wishes she was just a bit older , just a couple years , not much . 
Okay , i tried to muder a big brown fuzzy spider in my bedroom . The spider was in plain sight mocking my superior human power over it , but as soon as i nailed it with my BIG AND SEXY hair spray ... it just ran away D= .... i hope it dies a slow and painful death . ;} 
I have a fear of being bit by spiders in my own bed . So who wants so have a sleepover ! :D 
Murdered two spiders since i got offline :] \ 
Now im back on cause now i can't sleep !!! D: 
I LOVE DAYS WHERE YOU JUST WAKE UP HAPPY AND YOU ARE HAPPY ALL DAY LONG :D until you realize you need sleep but don't want to sleep because of spiders . Not to mention the next day might not be as good as the last and prolly won't be . :/ 
cats rule dogs drool . 
well , almost made it a whole day without getting on face book . But i just killed a spider and had to post about it so i failed .... lame . My day was FABULOUS though :D 
College boys arn't difficult to look at -- You know , older boys in general are so easy to look at . Facebook alows people to have SO MANY PHOTOS ON HERE ! * thumbs up for facebook * 
EARLY MORNING IS SO PRETTY ! 
Laughter is an instant vacation <3 <3 <3 
Well here's some Anthropology talk -Don't you see we're all descended from the family tree- Down through the long lost ages - Through the different phases , it seems that man was always jumpin ! 
I've decided I'm changing my last name too . There is no way I'm waiting untill I'm 18 to mess with the cosmic forses out there ! 
I made chilli and it was discusting . ... REALLY gross . 
I love bookboxes with a passion . A box that looks like a book , how cool is that . No one would ever suspect it to be a secret box that looks like a book . 
I love the rain 
drivers --- edd ............. is killing me slowly . I am moving to a big city where driving cars isn't cool and taking the bus everywhere is the way of life . <3 <3 <3 
I think I could live in a world without technology . 
I think people get more beautiful each and everyday . ( unless your on drugs ) 
I am SSOOOOOO excited to go to portland then seattle !!! I HOPE IT'S RAINY <3 <3 <3 
I BOUGHT MYSELF A SHADE UNBRELLA ! 
I hate summer , it's too hot . I dislike the sun also , even with a shade umbrella my forehead seems to become 10 shades darker than the rest of my face , even with the smallest exposure to light . :[ 
when you sit in a truck parked in seattle's < PROPFEMALE > town at 9pm and all the shops are closed , this is when you realize your mommy was right when she said \the creeps come out at night\ " .... it should be illegal to leave your grandkid in a car at night while you get a 2 hour massage . like im gonna stroll down a dark ally and look for a coffee shop . forget it . " 
Detour to Spokane WA .... I want to go home . :/ 
GOING TO THE FAIR ! :D 
I watch < PROPMALE > Dinamite last night on TV for the first time ever . Biggest waste of my life ever . No wonder people look at me weird when I say I'm from Idaho . 
Facebook has become rather boring . What a shame , I really liked Facebook . 
OH MY GOODNESS ! I've decided why even leave Idaho for school . I'm in love with Football and im going to BSU . Football is absolutly beautiful . 
Biggest BSU fan ever ! 
I just got on what i thought was MY Facebook < PROPFEMALE > on MY computer and somehow it was FARA's Facebook < PROPFEMALE > . It's like , dude , If your gonna get on my computer at least erase your tracks . jezz

Life is just wonderful . I love my family , i love my friends , i love my school . i just everyone so much :] <3<3<3 
The Back-Up Plan ... a horrible movie in my opinion . 
when you have a song stuck in your head , and the song doesn't have lyrics , i wish you could type in the < PROPFEMALE > into this little new feed . Then when people read it , the < PROPFEMALE > instantaneously in sucked into their brains too ... 
Name change was filed today . When I told Mr. < PROPMALE > he really didn't need to learn my stupid last name cause I was changing it , I was serious . IM SO EXCITED 
I just Love Jazz so much ! <3<3<3 
My little sister thought she could fly , then she tried to squash and kill my cat . 
MY OLDER SISTER IS LEARNING HOW TO PLAY THE BADPIPES ! oh I mean the Bagpipes ...... Ahhhhhhh ! 
Some people really don't know what a bad hair day is 
I wish I could turn back time and be twelve . 
Boys are better than girls
