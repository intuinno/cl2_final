This shows you right here that I don't have a LIFE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LMAO 

Sometimes we can take life for granted and GOD can snatch us back to reality , people be good stewards of whatever GOD gives you , never take GOD or LIFE for granted and always THANK GOD for whatever that he blesses you with . 
Always walk in fear of God Everyday , wake up and thank him for your life and what he has in store for you for the day , always praise him in advance . We are blessed that we are on this earth for one more day and we could have been dead and gone . GOD I thank you !!!! Forever grateful !!!!! 
REST IN PEACE ........ < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST >
