* deep breath * One . day . at . a . time .. stepping . blindly . into . faith . and . trust .. searching . for . peace . 
One day the world will stop spinning , my friend .. and then , you will see .. Oh how you will see the changes that could have and should have been made if not for human greed . 
Children\ 
with special needs do not have an illness ... it is not contagious . They\ 
only want what we all want : to be accepted . Can I make a request of \ 
anyone who is willing to post this and leave it on your status for at \ 
least an hour in Honor of Special Education week . 
I welcome sleep .. should it so choose to find me again sometime ... 
Describe me in ONE word , using the THIRD letter of you're name . This is fun . Answer me and then copy as your status and see what people say about you ... 
two words .. WHO DAT ( oh yes i had to do it lol ) 
.. found an old picture today that made me reminiscent .. Never say things out of anger , and always be ready to forgive someone you were once close to . Your best friend today , could very well be an enemy tomorrow . Everyone deserves a second < PROPMALE > .. Faith is Love , and forgiveness is a beautiful thing <3 
Broke-Ed computer sucks .. Daltons phone = yay facebook ! Lol 
finally able to get back on facebook ... finally not as busy as i have been ... so .. what have i missed the past month or so ? ( since alot of people didnt bother to call or anything :P ) 
.. is in a bit of a \what- if\ " mood at the moment .. but not quite sure what of .... hmmn .. " 
:: is sad :: 
wonders what tomorrow will bring , if anything at all 
okay everyone who is saying where they like it for no good reason on their status ... we KNOW you are a whore .. stop announcing it ! XD 
babushka ? ... babushka ! 
cest la vie 
sometimes .. i really wonder why ... lol 
This\ 
week we remember all babies born sleeping or whom we have carried But \ 
never met , or those we have held but could not take home or the ones that\ 
came home but didn't stay . Make this your status if you \ 
or someone you know has suffered the loss of a baby . The majority wont do \ 
it , Because unlike cancer , baby loss ...... is still a taboo ...... \ 
subject . Break the silence .. In memory of all lost Angels ... <3 
.. it's definitely time to cause a bit of trouble around these parts ..... or other parts .. anywhere really .. just for amusement 
time is short and life is shorter ... never have any regrets ! :) 
... :( 
you cant burn out if you werent ever on fire .... 
Memories are curious things ... they can brighten your day , or they can destroy it .. you can think of them on your own , or they can sneak up on you without warning ... :) anybody got a memory that affects them alot ? lol 
is playing on the computers at best buy lol 
mkay .. i give up now 
is thinking its friday and there needs to be mischief 
< PROPFEMALE > is a virtue that normally i have ... not today though :) 
can't wait to find out what happens next 
and the world keeps spinning , and lives keep depleting , and still there is no way to stop it , because you don't see it happening .. you only see it when it's done . Wake up . <3 
trying to help someone only works if they are willing to accept the help .. and otherwise you can only watch them crash and burn .. Sad . 
feels a touch abandoned .. by more than one person .. it's kind of depressing but at the same time , i know they will turn around , and they just might be surprised to find me not waiting behind them anymore . 
seriously wishes she could actually fall asleep .. doesnt seem to be in the cards just yet though :( 
tomorrow is just like today .. the problems remain and the amusements are the same , only the name changes . 
we are better than this .. we are more than this world can offer us .. <3 <3 
* giggle * is it bad that i'm a little entranced by this \new profile\ " ?? i think i has a new toy for a few hours ^_^ " 
Every little thing's gonna be alright 
is happy .. only 2 more people to get christmas presents for .. everyone else that matters is taken care of :D 
307- havent < PROPMALE > out with you in a long time , miss it we used to have fun literally doing nothing but listening to music and talking ... we need to < PROPFEMALE > out more <3 
420- ( lol btw love the number ) -- you are my best best friend and i dont know what i would do without you ... we've had our ups and our downs , but other than < PROPFIRST > you are one that knows more about me sometimes than i do myself , as i do you . i love you to death and i wish you nothing but the best <3 cant wait until you get home 
Live and let live .. until it starts affecting your personal life , then whoever is causing the mayhem will pay the consequence . <3 love to all my friends . kisses to all my family . Hell to anyone who tries to fuck with me . 
believes in second chances ... NOT third and fourth , etc . And is also getting very excited for the next couple of weeks .. loads of good things coming with the holidays . 
true .. complete .. boredom = taking quizzes on facebook . 
waiting on my < PROPMALE > to be delivered to me XD .. soooo glad he decided to come up this weekend <3 
laissez < PROPMALE > bons temps rouler ! :D and also in the spirit of the season .. < PROPFEMALE > christmas , happy hanukkah , kwannza . b < PROPMALE > sed be , and all that good jazz ! in short ... happy HOLIDAYS TO ALL ! <3 
< PROPFEMALE > christmas everyone :) .. < PROPFEMALE > is asleep cheese balls are made , and my mother and i got through drinking some mescato ( < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > !! lol ) all is calm til daybreak .. time to chill and talk to my < PROPMALE > . <3 <3 
If there is anyone else who wants to condemn me for what i believe , let me know now before the year is done so that I can start my new year fresh . and to those who already have condemned me based on their own ignorance of relics .. \let he who is withOUT sin cast the first stone \"." 
mmm .. bagels and cream cheese ... * i want a bagel and cream cheese , yeah the creamy cheese .. everyone loves the cheese and the cream and the cheesy cream ... * i cant help but quote the Foamy when im actually EATING the bagel and cream cheese >.< 
just heard some vey sad news ... a friend has died :( if anyone knows anything further on what exactly happened please let me know .. < PROPMALE > 
\Never doubt that a small group of committed people can change the world .. indeed it is the only thing that ever has .. \ " - < PROPFEMALE > mead " 
wondering if it ever really matters how close or far away you are from someone .. i dont think it does 
time needs to start flying so i dont start losing it . 
ka-boom ka-boom 
so ... i actually looked at one of those questions apps again .. and apparently EVERYONE agrees on one thing , that i am a tree-hugger ..... really ? lol is it that obvious ? 
had a blast today just hanging around the house :) :) cant wait for tomorrow night <3<3 
my pancakes say \i love you\ " on it !!! yay ! <3 you < PROPFEMALE >!" 
can't wait !!! only a few more hours !!! 
mmm ... had an awesome time tonight just hanging out and drinking my walk-me-downs lol .. bet we had more fun then that one poor girl that passed out outside ... 
HAHAHA !!! highly amused by this english(pirate ) language thing on facebook ... you MUST try it ... my news feed says \new ahoy ! \ " \ " shiniest booty\ " and \ " fresh booty\ " haha :) " 
and a wave of sleepiness has just hit ........ * yawn * 
R & B tonight :) fun fun fun ... everyone should come up there ... because we already have lots of people going so more will only be more fun ! XD XD 
whoo ho0o !!!!! had soooooooo much fun tonight ! <3 
Well .. that certainly was eventful and entertaining . haha should happen more often . 
More people need to understand that , as Americans , we take entirely too much for granted .. and more people all around need to understand that whatever is going wrong ... it could always be worse . It all depends on your perspective . And your dreams and determination . okay , I'm done now . 
DUCKY !!!!!!! 
.. feels very happy and at peace with everything around her for once ... I missed this <3 
I want you to know ... I'm a rainbow too .. <3 
can't sleep ... have a feeling it's going to be a looooooong day :\\ 
** Thumbing too fast is twices as good for nut/but ** HAHAHA*jaja * <3 you < PROPFEMALE > !!! :D 
well , I was right .. it was definitely a long day , and it ain't over yet . <3 
can't sleep .. so outside enjoying what little of sunrise I can see :) 
>.< snow makes me turn into a little kid again ... tee-hee 
wow , there are really some things that people say and do .. that I will NEVER figure out . To be honest , I'm not so sure I even want to . 
And here ... we ... Go . 
-- Knowledge speaks . But , only wisdom actually LISTENS -- <3 Hope everyone has a wonderful day XD 
Happy valentines day everyone <3 
* Porcelain in a paper-cup world .... * 
for the first time on FB .. i will say ... FML . thank you world you have re-affirmed my hatred for you and the way you work . 
Smile .. It often confuses people 
just posted a random note lol , pimping a site that I have a profile on because I kinda got bored with fb a little 
feels like such a dirty tree hugger today ....... ahahahaha 
So .. apparently I am < PROPFIRST > Lennon now . Which is fine by me heh .. 
Full size comfort mattress set with under frame for sale !!!! $400 or best offer ! First come , first serve ! Inbox me asap ! thanks guys !!!! 
Wow .. that's really freaking depressing .. I guess you never know who your friends are .. Not really . Something somewhere is really trying super hard to break my faith in people ..... 
sitting at my dad's house can't sleep .. got a lot of work to do tomorrow , can't wait to paint lol 
So , people should really stop asking me what is bothering me , when all they are going to do is tell me that I am selfish/bossy or something else for having said problem . Don't bother asking if you don't want to know . That my friends is why I neevr tell anyone what's wrong with me , and deal with it on my own . <3 
The path you follow may not be the right one , but it will still get you to where you're going to be in life eventually . <3 
Raindrops keep fallin ' on my head .. But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin ' red ..... :) 
Aunt < PROPFEMALE > - one of the most inspiring people I've ever had the pleasure to know , and I was lucky enough to be able to call her family . You will be missed , and wait for us in Heaven . R.I.P. <3 Your family loves you . 
boo-yah ! 
I was going to say something , but I changed my mind . It's not my place to .. Let me just say that some people should really not be allowed to reproduce . 
FLY pelican FLY ! 
Brace yourself .... Here we go again ! 
Happy Easter tomorrow , everyone . This is the day that you should show kindness to bunnies .. Dye eggs strange colors .. And celebrate you're belief of Jesus rising from the dead , if that is your beliefs . :) Great day to all . <3 
Don't smile unless you mean it .. Don't love unless you FEEL it .. and Dance like no one is watching , even if you KNOW that someone always is . <3
