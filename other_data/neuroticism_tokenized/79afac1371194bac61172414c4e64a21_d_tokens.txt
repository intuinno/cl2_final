\Thriller movies\ " are just what smart people call really good horror movies because they're ashamed of watching anything even remotely associated with Freddy/Jason/Jaime < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST >." 

You know , if it weren't for viral videos , I'd probably have a job right now . 
Well , I've been pressured into it . I'm actually gonna try and USE this thing for a change . You crazy kids . 
By the way , if I do any massive Facebook faux pas , you let me know , okay ? 
I think I've mastered the skill of having badass dreams . I just watched < PROPMALE > knife fight a conjurer . 
My god . I think I'm suffering from socializing overload . Everyone's ... everyone's here . After the constant drought of Myspace I feel ... I feel like ... I've come home . 
I wish I could shut my playboy mouth . 
And so , after the psychotic sensory overload of Facebook , < PROPMALE > enjoyed some calming time at the piano , and all was well . 
This whole \waking up at 5 in the afternoon\ " thing is not gonna go over so well tomorrow ... " 
For those you of who don't know the gospel , Rifftrax may well be the greatest way to make watching an old movie interesting . 
God . Words cannot overestimate the quality of Jimi's guitar playing on All Along the Watchtower . 
I just set my alarms for the upcoming weeks . I'm depressed now . 
And now , 24 hours after my exile from the internet , my triumphant return ! 
New phone , so you know the drill . Send me your number however way you wish , or don't be surprised if I ignore you . 
Some people are complaining that I'm ignoring them . This is probably because I DON'T HAVE YOUR NUMBER ANYMORE !!! New phone . Send your number to me , and if I ignore you afterwards then I do actually hate you . 
T-Mobile has so many Rush ringtones ! Must ... resist ... spending ... 
How can I find both < PROPFIRST > Mayer and Between the Buried and Me equally appealing . Even I don't think that makes any sense . 
There is unrest in the < PROPMALE > ... trouble with the trees ... 
There's no party like a Donner Party ! 
I love the little stories Facebook tells , if you know how to look . People ask how I know so much about their lives , relationships and habits . Well , THIS is where I do my research . 
Very few rock stars look better as they get older . Geddy < PROPFIRST > is one of them . 
Listening to death metal while tired is such an odd sensation . 
So apparently three archaeologists found a spark plug completely encased in rock . The rock was 500,000 years old . I'm scared . 
I'm 90 percent sure I didn't actually go to middle school , based on how little I remember . 
Is it a good sign when you get your own band's song stuck in your head ? 
I just ate 11 dollars worth of discount steak ! I am a MAN ! 
Remember when I once slept . Twice beyond the veil I now find myself , an infinite coercion amongst pervasive perversion . 
Social connections , you are fucking awesome . 
Is it immoral to just ... rearrange an old essay for a new class ? For the sake of ... consistency , let's say . 
Did Facebook just turn into the Washington Post for a second , or was that just me ? 
By the way , if you haven't heard , < PROPMALE > Crimson are really damn good . 
Question : should I or should I not shave my goatee ? 
Remember , in event of a nuclear explosion , stick your head between your legs and kiss your ass goodbye . 
Listen to < PROPMALE > Copeland , < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > Peart , and < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ardson , and you will know everything there is to know about drumming . 
You know what's fascinating ? Listening to a couple argue during your Philosophy class . 
I'm not offensive , I'm ofFUNsive !! 
Hey guys ! I've got an idea ! How about you STOP SIGNING UP FOR THAT \Blankety blank just answered a question ! \ " APP ?! It's a scam ! " 
I just learned Creep by Radiohead on Piano . Four chords . Axis of Awesome was right ; it's dead simple to write a pop hit . 
Green Day Rock Band ? Seriously ? So many good bands out there , and you choose THAT piece of shit to deify ? I'm mildly enraged . 
Weird night . I'll say that much . 
It is really hard to post a positive picture comment without feeling creepy . 
I gotta say ; today was a good day . 
Weird to have money and not be spending it . Being fiscally responsible is boring . 
Bring me the head of Maury Povich . 
Is it sad that I'm looking through a catalog of personality disorders and I know someone that fits for each one ? 
I really should start a radio show . I would play such good/weird music . Plus , apparently , I have the voice . 
Congrats again to the < PROPFEMALE > cast . You put on an excellent show . 
Oh < PROPMALE > . I'm never bored during conversations with you . 
Have you ever not realized how hungry you were and then just started shaking ? 
God's Little Joke - I am the biggest House fan I know , yet whenever I injure my leg , it's always my left . Har-de-har , Jesus ! 
God , I love me . I am fucking hilarious . 
Just preparing for the GREATEST CONCERT OF MY LIFE ! 
I'm gonna go roast in the hot tub for a bit . Text myah . 
Someone educate me : how in the name of God are guys complicated ? Selfish , yes . Cruel we may be . But complicated ? Elaborate , please . 
I just fell asleep for three hours . Time to go back to bed ! 
I know I've posted this before , but its awesomeness is hard to overstate . 
You know , it doesn't take long looking around the internet to make you want to kill humanity . 
Alright . I really should sleep if I don't want to hate myself completely tomorrow . 
Everyone bust out your treadmills . Gotta be ready for Commando's on Friday . 
Just spent an hour on Youtube . My < PROPFIRST > Walken impression is improving by leaps and bounds . 
Two days ago I was feeling lonely . Now every day I have is booked from now until Tuesday . Life takes strange turns . 
I love e-mails that ask me if I \Wish to act like a porn-star ? Bang a magic pill ! \"" 
And I won't remember your name and face when I tell you were judged by the funhouse cast . 
I have three words , the solution to any problem : Get . Staggering . Drunk . 
Wow . House Season Finale left me drained . Jesus . 
Since when did talking explicitly about your relationship in your status updates become a good idea ? I don't get it . 
I just dreamt that House had been forced to relocate to a hotel in Mexico and his entire diagnostic team had been replaced with < PROPMALE > Cheney . My brain is WEIRD . 
The Mars Volta make good workout music . So do < PROPFEMALE > in Chains . 
You can go your own way ... 
Someone just deleted their Facebook because of me . I feel a sense of accomplishment . 
There's a list of annoying Facebook habits that I'm compiling . I feel a blog coming on ... 
DEAD WEEK WILL NOT CLAIM MY SOUL ! 
Within the last 48 hours , I have written a research paper , taken two tests , filmed and edited a movie , and slept a grand total of 5 hours . I will now take a well-deserved nap . 
Problem with midday naps ; I am now wide awake . 
Lots of breakups going around Facebook lately . I blame the < PROPFEMALE > . 
Free compliments ! You know the drill . Like this status and I'll say something I like about you . 
Next piano goal : Intro to Fossil Genera , by Between the Buried and Me 
Damn it . Sleep just doesn't work sometimes . 
Don't you love it when a professor corrects your grammar ? Especially when your grammar was correct ? 
\Thanks be to God that he gave me stubbornness 
Fewer things make me happier than waking up to a voicemail of my bandmates drunkenly serenading me . I love you guys . 
\I'm not particularly arrogant . I just accurately assess myself as the shit . \ " \ 
\People have often said that my beating of skins pulled so tightly over wooden cylinders is the most attractive part of my personality . \ " \ 
Late at night , good evening , listening to music , feeling pensive ... I'm thinking I'ma take a drive . 
Grades just came in . I get to keep my car ! Hell yeah ! 
Internet is taking a shit again , for NO apparent reason , so ... if you want to get in contact with me , you know my number . 
I normally don't get whiny about this , but allow me a moment of self-pity ; being sick sucks . :( 
And ... let the Avatar Facebook hate surge begin . 
Gorillaz turned down < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > from working on Plastic Beach because she's marrying < PROPFIRST > Brand . I knew I loved that band for a reason . 
I need to start liking some new bands . Not because I'm bored with my music , but I'd be willing to wager my friends are getting a little sick of Porcupine Tree . 
You're not where I am right now . And that makes me sad . 
Well , I didn't initially plan on talking to < PROPFIRST > Norton until 5 A.M. , but in retrospect I'm very glad I did . 
But after a while , you realize time flies . \ 
And the best thing that you can do\ 
Is take whatever comes to you . \ 
' Cause time flies . 
Probably gonna be disconnecting the one computer in my house that gets internet tonight , so if I vanish from the Facebook scene , that's why . I love remodeling . 
Am I just an annoyed atheist , or have people on this website been mentioning God more than they usually do ? 
Studies show 90% percent of men grow facial hair so they have the ability to stroke their beard while they think . 
My 88-year-old Aunt spends more time on Youtube than I do . 
Just finished first day of work . I don't think I've been this tired ... well , ever . 
Facebook ... I've been away from you for so long , I'm not even sure you're the same person anymore ... 
Getting on Facebook at < PROPFIRST>'s does not provide the atmosphere and time allowance I need . 
You might be shocked , but there's not a lot to do in < PROPMALE > , Washington . 
The river is running the color of blood . 
I feel so unamerican , but I feel I need to fess up ; I don't give a shit about football . 
If you genuinely like < PROPFIRST > Bieber , you are not allowed to reproduce . We . Will . Stop you . 
I'm debating adopting a post as official full-time Facebook troll . Thoughts ? 
There's a kid in my < PROPMALE > class named Lars Ulrich . I can't get over that . 
Could people stop mentioning God in EVERY status update ? Yeah , I'm an atheist , but you don't see me stating a belief to his non-existence every other day . Hell , even if you were talking about Fallout 3 that frequently , I would tell you to get out more . And I fucking LOVE Fallout 3 . 
What do you do when you're incredibly lonely , but don't feel like talking to anybody ? 
Offending people makes me giggle . 
It's impossible to be truly upset when RUSH is playing . 
So many relationship updates lately . Isn't spring the time of year everyone's supposed to be having lots of sex ? 
< PROPFEMALE > loves gangstas . 
“People write to me and say , ‘I’m giving up , you’re not talking to me . ’ I just write them a simple message like , ‘Never give up , ’ you know ? And it changes their life . ”\ 
\ 
- < PROPFIRST > Bieber , on being an asshole . 
Generic people fascinate me . I don't understand them . 
Math homework is pain incarnate , the least useful use of time , the definition of the Orwellian populace-output-destrucion that O'Brien outlines in the last chapters of 1984 . \ 
Math homework will lead us to tyranny . < PROPFIRST > my words . 
< PROPMALE > - \Jimmie 
If you don't like puppies , you're evil . End of discussion . 
Gig tonight . Wish me luck . 
Is there anybody out there who shares my random and somewhat pathetic obsession with Burn Notice ? 
Pre-loading New Vegas . It feels like Christmas < PROPFEMALE > . 
Dear Porcupine Tree : Stop making music I love . It's kind of creeping me out how well a bunch of guys from England understand my musical tastes . 
Fallout New Vegas , you are more beautiful than words can describe . Now please stop crashing my computer . 
Mea culpa , mea culpa , mea < PROPFEMALE > culpa . 
The new Sherlock Holmes is played by a guy named < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Cumberbatch . That is , by far , the most British name I've ever heard . 
Ah Halloween . That magical time of year where women can dress like whores and not be criticized . 
Paranormal Activity : The story of a family haunted by a mysterious force from beyond and an obsessive need to catalogue everything on film . 
And Prop 19 dies an honorable death . So much for the illusion of social progress . 
A story containing the first appearance of Cthulhu is published in 1928 . The stock market crashes in 1929 . \ 
COINCIDENCE ?!?! 
Coming clean : such a double-edged sword . 
I wish people would just think about their goddamn political opinions . I don't care if you disagree with me , just please have put some thought into your positions . And no , watching Fox News or MSNBC does not count as \thinking \"." 
Guess what , Facebook ? Anybody you meet now ? They're not the love of your life . Your life is gonna be too long and too interesting for your current squeeze to define it in such a manner . Now quit being dramatic . 
Requiem for a Dream is a descent to hell on celluloid . 
Just watched Requiem for a Dream again . I can't get over how chilling that movie is . 
Not gonna lie ; I have a bit of a crush on < PROPFEMALE > Thompson . 
You know what's a great remedy for annoying undone homework ? Dropping out of school . At least , it's been working great for me . 
is a little peeved/agitated . Oh well . That's why God invented smoke breaks . 
To use an old phrase , I am just full of piss and vinegar today ! 
The word \rendezvous\ " literally has a silent Z in it . The French don't make any goddamn sense . " 
Downloading < PROPMALE > Season 3 . I am so goddamn excited . 
Most experts estimate that 1 in every 100 people is a psychopath , a person without empathy , morals , or self-control . How many people do you have on your friends list ? 
When < PROPFEMALE > Watson grows up and fills out a little more , she should play a Bond Girl . 
If I could , I would hire < PROPFIRST > Lithgow to be my Grandpa . 
Facebook on a 47-inch screen is a < PROPMALE > bit overwhelming . 
When are they finally gonna put < PROPFIRST > Beck down ? He's already claiming there's a massive conspiracy to collapse this nation at the hand of the guy who owns NPR . How much longer before he forgets how to shower and starts chewing on the furniture ? 
Something like 60% of all Facebook usage is men looking at women's profiles and pictures . Sleep well tonight , ladies . 
God , < PROPFEMALE > is really just a self-centered bitch . There's nothing else to it . 
Well , today's been a bit emotionally draining . 
God . < PROPMALE > Vicious was a useless sack of shit . 
I'm sorry to everyone if I've been ... absent lately . I've been going through a bit of a rough spot . I'll be back in the game soon . 
Random girls ; stop adding me on Facebook . You never talk to me , and you're not interesting enough for me to talk to you , so we just wind up deleting each other . Where's the fun in that ? 
Downloading Sonic CD . I've never been this excited for a trip down memory < PROPFIRST > . 
I've been lying here sick for so long that the couch now has a divot . 
There's a specific method men use when flirting with women on Facebook . It amazes me how little it changes . 
The world has been run so stupidly for so long that it's a miracle we're all still breathing . 
Reading a book of psychological profiles . My new favorite phrase ? \(His exploits included ) prankish defecation into the stringed intricacies of the school piano \"." 
Gotta be on the road in 8 hours . But am I sleeping ? Clearly , you don't know me very well . 
Finally arrived in La Grande . Staying here for the next 5 days . Be still my fucking beating heart .

Aunt < PROPFEMALE > has nicknamed me \her little jackass . \ " I wear the title proudly . " 
There's no delicate way to say this , so I'm just gonna say it ; Lady Gaga has improved my sex life . \ 
\ 
There . I feel better . 
It is unpatriotic to say that < PROPFEMALE > is a Christian nation . People who argue this ( appallingly common ) blatantly ignore the Constitution and bastardize one of the most important principles our Founding Fathers fought for ; separation of Church and State . 
Sometimes , you just gotta put some friendships in the ground . 
Having an intense urge to show people good movies . Anybody up for American Psycho ? 
I feel more sane when I'm talking fluidly to myself . Is that a bad sign ? 
Black Swan : Holy fucking shit that's a good movie . 
God is whatever his followers need him to be . Some see this as proof of his omnipotence . I see it as proof of his invention . 
I think watching the Godfather and Goodfellas back-to-back has made me racist against Italians . 
Why can't people LEARN TO WRITE ?! 
Chillin ' with my Grandma at the end of a long , long day . 
Fight the zombies ! 
This world isn't meant to be lived in 24/7 . If it were , God wouldn't have given us an imagination . 
As much as it pains me , I think I heard the death knell ... 
FUCK YOU MUSSBURGER !!! 
ALL TIED UP BITCHEZ !!!! 
Who wants to get angry drunk ? 
Anybody who hasn't seen Notes on a Scandal is missing out . 
Dear Pundits ; It's not < PROPFEMALE > Palin's fault that congresswoman got shot . Nor is it Obama's . Crazy people do crazy shit because they're crazy . Trying to find out why a crazy person does something crazy is , in and of itself , insane . 
Yeah , I'm a fucking < PROPFIRST > now . This is retarded . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Berguin is bigger than Jesus . 
In a delightfully pissy mood . I feel like I could have a religious argument with the Pope and win . 
You people aren't interesting today . For shame . 
I feel hollow . Empty . Seperate , like I'm pretending to feel , but there's a gulf around my heart , a gap\ 
between me and \normal people\ " . I've felt this way on a regular basis for years . \ 
New rule : People who don't understand natural selection aren't allowed to mock it . 
Came home to a wireless ergonomic keyboard . If my day hadn't already been made , this would've taken care of it . 
How come I can't blog anymore , but the moment I see a biblical literalist on Facebook I can crap out < PROPMALE > of text ? 
I hate to fall into racial stereotypes , but I fucking love chorizo . 
If you're trying to win over an atheist , Christians , don't tell him he's going to hell . It just makes you look like a bunch of egotistical self-righteous douchebags . 
\Im Ready fora \ " Datss Maaa Gurl\ " kinna niggaaa\ " \ 
\Not knowing how to cook is like not knowing how to fuck . You gotta do both to live . \ " \ 
Y'know , I could get used to these midnight walks . 
I thought I could go one day without a goddamn Facebook confrontation , but noooo ... 
Running two monitors because ... well ... because I fucking can , really . 
Lotta breakups going around Facebook lately . And from what I understand , there are more to come . 
I was really hoping we wouldn't have to go over this again , but ... STOP MAKING NAZI ANALOGIES !!! They're sneaking back into our public discourse , they're taking over Fox News , and the more they get repeated , the more people tend to believe them . You know what else spread that quickly ...? \ 
THE NAZIS !!! 
Gonna be doing a friends list purge in the next couple of days . If you want to survive , start talking to me/stop posting annoying shit . 
Computer's broken again . My Facebook presence is gonna be drastically reduced for a while here . 
Don't behave like the people you see on TV . It's not admirable . 
You know , if you just view it on its own , the nose is really unattractive . 
It needs to get cold again . My allergies are fucking killing me . 
I pride myself on being environmentally unconscious . 
New Rule : People aren't allowed to brag about going to college if they can't spell the word . 
I use \ergo\ " more often than \ " therefore\ " . Does that make me a douche ? " 
Anyone taken their car in recently ? Any suggestions of good places to go ? My axles are screeching something awful . 
So , apparently magnetism can fuck with the brain's ability to make moral decisions . I fucking love < PROPFEMALE > Science Now . 
The black guy at the beginning of the Shining is SO GODDAMN BLACK . 
\Ritual is what happens when we run out of rational . \ " \

Deathly Hallows Pt . 1 served mainly to remind me how depressing most of the English countryside is . 
Can we just get through today without too many engagements ? Please ?

Every single patient on House is incredibly allergic to commercial breaks .

My God . My schmoozing meter is nearly depleted . 
\I have examined all the known superstitions of the word 
New Rule : Anybody described as an '' internet funnyman '' is physically incapable of actually being funny .

OH SHI- 
Since we've been talking a lot about stereotypes and prejudice , let me throw another one down ; just because I am a 19-year-old male does not mean I own an XBOX 360 . I know most of my gender have gone through about 5 of these systems by this point in their life , but for future reference , I'm a PC gamer . Always have been , always will be . 
To all you bastards quoting Doctor Horrible : I tried to introduce that shit 3 years ago , when it came out . But did you listen ? Noooo ... 
Guess who's gonna go walkin ' in the snow , bitchez ! 
Quick survey : Who on my friends list believes that you should only date someone if you intend to marry them ? 
Christian Bale : It's about damn time . 
Ah , Firefly . How can there be so much entertainment in just 12 episodes ?

If < PROPFIRST > Trump becomes president , I'm leaving . 
Movie premise : What if we lived in an alternate universe where everything < PROPFIRST > Beck said was true ? 
Apparently the Mayans were wrong ; the world's ending on May 21st now . 
What do you guys think of me naming my first son \Ashur \"?" 
My father ; a college graduate who's principal of the school he helped design and build , and he's in the living room laughing uncontrollably at Jackass 3D .
