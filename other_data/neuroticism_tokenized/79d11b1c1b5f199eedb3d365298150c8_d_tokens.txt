Guess what ! Its the weekend ! 
It looks so nice out . I half want to just go outside and run around barefoot but that means i'd have to change out of my pjs ... 
Three day week ! 
I'm so looking forward to the weekend even though i was only at school for three days ... 
You know , this week could have started out better but at least I passed the trig tests ( so far ) pros can outweigh the cons :) 
Chris : \Jessica Simpson ? \ " Me : \ " Parabola ? \"" 
This day has been so great . Mrs. Kuntz is amazing ! 
There's something I wish would happen but everytime I try to figure out what it is I forget . Kinda annoying but w/e this day was great 
I'm so bad at ' comforting ' people yet they still come to me . I love the fact that they trust me enough to come to me but I usually have no clue what to say ... 
someone should kidnap me for the weekend ... 
We need like another week for the weekend . 
< PROPFIRST > has a book and knows how to use it . my headache is proof enough 
i'm so happy 
I don't know why I feel so crappy but I do and I'm incredibly pissed off at just about everyone . 
I passed my driving license test ! :) 
I will make varsity . I will . 
so looking forward to Thursday's meet 
mom : \quick look for them ! \ " me : \ " are they going someplace ? \ " ( in relation to 3 hour burning logs that were $15 ) " 
Yay , I am so happy about my trig test . I hope my Algebra II test is just as easy ! 
I was so excited about my math tests and strength and conditiong ( even though i totally tripped over that one dude and ran into the other ) but then sickness decided that it was time to call 
so happy to be back at school ! i miss too much being sick ... 
I absolutely love < PROPFIRST > ! She's so much fun to be around and math . Oh , wow

I'm going with that if I open and close the doors on the fridge and pantry enough times something good will magically appear 
Betrayal is inevitable in any relationship

Worst day of my life . Anyone hate me and would kill me in blind rage right now cause I could use that 
Best night . Haven't laughed that hard in a while . So strange that I can be this happy even considering what's happened . 
Well , I'm kind of bored of summer . Anyone wanna do something this weekend or whenever ? 
Just saw a full rainbow . Rainbows are suppose to be symbols of hope . Sadly it faded shortly after I saw it . I wonder if the indicates fading hope ? 
Weekend , finally . Even though its summer I need this weekend . 
One week ! 
My FSI handbook came today ! I'm so excited . I can't wait to go . It's gunna be the most amazing time ever 
Guys are immature , insensitive jerks . 
Its a relief to be leaving Sunday . I really can't wait 
This has not been my week , actually month . Things better get better by next Sunday or I'm probably going to severly hurt myself . 
Okay so I must have been in a state of numbness for the past like 2 weeks or w/e cause I think it's finally hit me that I'm alone cause last night when Kaite Burger claimed me as hers < PROPFIRST > Hood wasn't there to dispute that claim . I miss my life

Mostly good day today . Happy no one hates me ... that I know of anyways ! Can't wait for tomorrow : ) car ... 
Holding hands isn't necessarily an display of romantic affection . Its showing that you are someone's friend and that they can trust you and you'll be there for them no matter what . I absolutely love all of my friends 
\We can cover more ground if we split up . \ " \ " You forgot ' with blood ' between ' ground ' and ' if ' . \ " \ " Right

“The aim of education should be to teach us rather how to think , than what to think - rather to improve our minds , so as to enable us to think for ourselves , than to load the memory with thoughts of other men . ” 
This was , by far , the best homework assignment ever ! I love this and I can't wait to see what Mrs. Lumpkin says : )

Where has everyone gone ? Why am I alone ? 
I'm so looking forward to the weekend 
Wow , yesterday was so much fun , < PROPFIRST > Koenig and Kaite Burger ! Thanks for giving us a < PROPMALE > to get out of the house . 
Mentally feel like I have been through a blender ... 
So ... I guess I'm out for the rest of the season 
Homecoming tonight ! I'm kinda extremely nervous but its going to be so much FUN 
That was the most amazing night . Super tired but it was definately worth it , I had the time of my life 
Common theme in the books I read : people DIE 
84% on AP Euro DBQ . Hell yeah ! 
I hate guys ... 
Okay , I'm officially bored of break . Anyone want to get together to do something ?

Can I just ... leave ? 
\You have been liberated by the Soviet Union ! \""

Every person has 1000 wishes . A cancer patient only has one : to get better . I know that 97% will not post this as their status , but I know that my friends will be one of the 3% and put this as their status , at least for an hour , in honor of those who died because of cancer or are still fighting 
Apparently I have \personal foibles . \ " I'm not entirely sure what that means ... " 
SO EXCITED ! 
Had the best day with < PROPFIRST > . So happy I was able to spend time with him : ) 
I have a knack for getting the people that I care about mad at me . So , decision time . I'm done with everything . 
I feel worthless 
\But I'm over you And there ain't nothing that you could say or do To take what you did back \"" 
Think I'm falling in love ... 
YAY ! I get to see my boyfriend tonight : ) <3 
Someone just kill me now 
Love having friends , < PROPFIRST > Stoner , I am completely comfortable talking about literally ANYTHING with . 
There are at least two people in this world that you would die for 
Best night I've had in a while . And Noises Off was outstanding ! 
Even on the worst of days there’s always someone who cares\ 
When you think it’s all going downhill , I love you . \ 
I promise\ 
( Wow , I can be creative for a English assignment , now why can't I be this creative for my story ? ) 
What someone says isn't always true . In fact it rarely is true 
Arms around my body , kisses on my skin ... 
Death comes at a price 
One of the best Thanksgivings ever . I love my relatives : ) 
Favorite actor : Judd Hirsch ( NUMB3RS ) 
From experiences I've decided that there are two things you can't trust when someone says them : \ 
1 . I love you\ 
2 . I won't/don't want to hurt you 
Can't wait for tomorrow !!! 
Love ... is elusive 
< PROPFIRST > : I'm getting the Pasta with chicken , sun dried tomatoes , and mushrooms . \

Can't wait for Friday <3 
That was definately a better \waste\ " of 2 hours than sitting on Facebook : P " 
Thanks to everyone who wished me a \happy birthday . \ " It was a very good ( and long ) day : ) " 
Good day , mostly . Havent cried this much since I don't know when though ... 
Definately got up way too early , and the coffee didn't help much . I'm ready to just pass out . 9 o'clock needs to get here sooner : ) 
Notice me , please ? 
We're all bored so this gives us something to do .. lol . Confession time ! ( INBOX ONLY ) .... 2010 is almost over . Confess something you've always wanted to tell me or ask me . ( 100% private ) Put this as your status . you might be surprised ! 
Jessie : \Is that the testicle face guy you like 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas to everyone . Hope ya'll are having a good day and spending time with family 
FSI people , \ 
I am going to write a memoir and wanted to know if you all would be okay with your names in it as they are or if you'd like me to change them . : ) 
No , don't try to save me . Is someone else calling you baby ? \ 
( love this song ) 
Slept till 1:30 and woke up tired . Yes : ) 
This is the best day of my life 
Am now nervous about school starting ... Great : ( 
I'm not sure about this :\ 
Very energetic . Intelligent . Can be jealous and/or possessive . Hardworking . Can become obsessive or secretive . Holds grudges . Determined . Loves being in long relationships . Talkative . Can be self-centered at times . Passionate and Emotional . 
It might be a good idea for me to not drive . I think there needs to be a law saying that in order to drive you must not be really frickin ' pissed off or crying ( visibility issues ) . Especially when there's ice on the roads ... 
Kingery is by far the best teacher ever ... He definately made my day 
\I make fun with you . \"" 
Good end to a terrible week 
Sometimes I just want to believe in < PROPFEMALE > tales ... 
love means holding onto someone just as hard as you can because if you don't , one blink and they might disappear forever ... 
Well Mother Nature finally showed up , now I'm just waiting for < PROPFEMALE > 
Somewhere with you ... 
Weekends suck 
If I fall can you let me down easy ? 
That's the most I've eaten in like a month . I feel like crap now : ( 
Chris : Mom , I think I bit off part of my tongue . \ 
Mom : Well the only person that will ever know is the guy you french kiss . \ 
Me : And everyone on facebook ! LOL : ) 
This was a really good day . I like figuring stuff out : ) 
Its torn ... and its RED ! 
K-State ! 
I'm completely head-over-heels ... 
I don't feel better yet , but I'm on my way 
Can I just die now ? I'm so not looking forward to this week . I never realized how much two letters could hurt
