God is patient , God is kind . He does not envy , He does not boast , He is not proud . He is not rude , He is not self-seeking , He is not easily angered , He keeps no record of wrongs . God does not delight in evil but rejoices in truth . He always protects , always trusts , always hopes , always perseveres . God never fails . 
my deep thought provoking questions while staring out the window on the way home .... why are most kid slides always yellow ? and why do mailboxes have rounded tops ?.... anybody know ??

my rice crispies are yelling at me .... the only way to stop them is to eat them .... O.o 
our life goal should be to be play-dough ... so God can mold us to be whatever he wants us to be ... and cause play-dough is awesome :) 
finishing up packing now ... leaving in __ hours for < PROPFEMALE > ... prolly 5ish or so in mininger time ... lol :) 
i just failed at deleting friends from facebook ..... only 2 this time ... normally its like 30 or 40 .... guess im feeling generous today .. it was prolly because of that wonderful bike ride and being able to enjoy the afternoon with < PROPFEMALE > Balmer and < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > :] 
naps are very nice :) 
i want salad . and no matter how many times i open up the fridge door no lettuce appears :[ 
sometimes you have a dream that you believe is to be true but then God changes the circumstances and that dream becomes unrealistic ... sometimes this is painful but God changes those circumstances for the better and other doors are opened up ... the doors arent always completely obvious to us or even comprehendable .. but there has to be an understanding that God knows what is best and he is in control no matter what .

doing laundry from camp so i can pack for the missions trip on tuesday :) 
is it weird that the only reason i like colgate more than crest is because colgate has a flip lid and crest has a screw on lid ?.... i think that categorizes me as a lazy american lol

i have 69 photo albums on facebook ..... and on all of those albums is 3,163 pictures .... thats only slightly ridiculous ..... right ? 
hopefully this huge glass of orange juice will cure this cold/whatever i have .... 
< PROPFEMALE > + construction paper + scissors = hopefully something creative ... 
\Be who you are and say what you feel 
\Eternity is a long time to think about what you should have done . \"" 
i have 17 more hours on pandora this month .... could they roll over to the next month ? like roll over minutes ? or whatever theyre called ... lol 
* insert epic profound statement here * 
just got super tired . wonder why .... oh yah .... sweating a ton at a 6-9 practice in almost hundred degree weather will do that .... kinda weird but i enjoyed it :) 
leaving in 3 1/2 hours ( aka 2 am ) to go to the steiner reunion :) gotta love my \strange leave time\ " family lol i should prolly finish packing so i can get a few hours of sleep before i drive ... " 
Cordeo , cordeo , wherefore out thou camera cord ?

* earlier thought * today doesnt feel like a thursday .... oh wait ... its wednesday ... thats prolly why .. oopsies :) 
how can we tell others about God if we dont know Him personally ? .. aka listen to what He has to say to us and seek God in his plan for us everyday . God can do big things in your life even if you arent \out on the missions field\ " .... wherever you are right now in life is your missions field . "

i wouldve gone to the end of practice cause im feeling a < PROPMALE > better but then it started raining .... :/ 
Goshen Invitational 630 be there . lets go Raider Band !! :) 
so sleeeepy and freezing cold under a pile of blankets with a sweatshirt and sweatpants :[ 
just created a crime scene with tomato juice in my fridge . 
i dont have my precal book .... its in my locker .... at school ... not with me ... huh . \ 
i just chugged some orange juice . \ 
that fly is huge ... and circling my head ... \ 
im cold . \ 
* zones out*\ 
i should take another nap ... \ 
theyre marching in band right now ... im not there ... :[ 
hopefully the swelling in my lymph nodes will be gone by tomorrow morning . 
i feel like im forgetting to do something .... hmmmm .... 
has been drawing for the last couple hours :] .... my three precal assignments can come later :] 
makin me some hot chocolate :) 
so glad i journaled while i was in Ometepe , Nicaragua ... can't believe that was over a year ago .... i miss it and the people there <3 thank you God for incredible experiences :) 
Writing is a type of < PROPMALE > ; you have to form your thoughts so they fit together and make sense in the end , just as you would form lines and figures in a drawing . Sometimes a small portion of a story or a drawing wouldn’t make sense by itself , but then in the end when looking at the big picture there is an understanding of what was forming in the beginning . 
over an hour and a half later and almost 2,200 words im done with my first attempt at journaling by typing .... seemed to work well ... wish all of that couldve been for my paper due on tuesday lol ... maybe ill do this more often . its a good way to vent/ think about things . 
ahh ! watching past marching band shows ... brings back so many memories ! :) 
what to do what to do .... work on a paper thats due next monday ... read a book of my choice for the first time in months ... or edit pictures on picnik ... hmmm .... 
sometimes things don't make sense . why are we so blessed ? why aren't we the ones living in poverty not knowing where our next meal is coming from ? why not us ? \ 
<3 Nicaragua <3 
woah ... its october ??? as in less than 3 months till 2012 ?? weird .
