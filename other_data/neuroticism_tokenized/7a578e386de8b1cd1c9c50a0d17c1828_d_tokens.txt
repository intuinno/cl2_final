Just had the most interesting gas station experience in my life . My gas pump took so long I had time to go into the store , buy a sandwich , and eat the whole thing before my tank was full , I got asked for a dollar by some lady looking to fill her tank , and I witnessed two car accidents within five minutes of each other at the same gas station parking lot . 
Thanks for all the birthday wishes everyone :)
