Making a decision isn't easy , and doing what's right is hard . In the end , doing the right thing is what matters . Nothing is really fair , you have to take the good with the bad . When you doubt if what you did was the wrong decision , remind yourself , what you're doing is the right thing to do . ^^ 
feelin kinda crappy esp knowing < PROPFEMALE > Coronado got me ill , + hella hw&busy schedule .. not bueno 
shots shots shots

everyone seem to call me < PROPFEMALE > , even my sis . wtf < PROPFEMALE > Coronado 
we can't go back to the way it used be . gotta accept we've gone our seperate ways and our relationship has become a part of history . it pains me to admit it , to know we've lost the best thing I've ever had . but I know there is no way we could ever get it back . so i'm done trying to be searching for someone who no longer exists . because Im tired of living a life of the chances that I have missed . its time to move on .. 
i seriously do not understand how these things work , people = complicated 
proud of myself :) - went to all my classes this week ( minus a few late's ) for the first time this semester ! :D
