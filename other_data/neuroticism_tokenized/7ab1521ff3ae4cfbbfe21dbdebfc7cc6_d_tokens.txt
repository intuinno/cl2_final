< PROPFEMALE > has decided to rock n ' roll all night and party everyday . It's exhausting . 

My kid has officially started the \terrible 2's\ " . Ugh ! " 
Beetlejuice ! Beetlejuice ! Beetlejuice ! Dude , < PROPFIRST > Keaton is walking around town right now . Should I stalk Batman , or what ?! 
Determination is a wonderful feeling . 
I'm going to make things super ... all by myself . 
I think Google hates me . 
12 more days till I can take Liddy to the real world ! 
Things are about to get crazy . 
I was doing laundry and I told < PROPFEMALE > to put her pants on her bed . So she starts laughing and running around the house with her pants on her head . That's rad . 
I need to figure out where I want to move to . Hmmm .... 
Chicken butt . 
I'm all packed and ready to get the hell out of here ! 
I can't sleep and I have to get up in three hours ! Maybe I should just make some coffee and stay awake . 
I'm jealous of everyone at Comic Con ... Break some nerd sweat for me . 
I'm in California . Yay ! 
My wisdom tooth is trying to kill me ... slowly . 
< PROPFEMALE > just went to the beach for the first time ! 
It has never been more apparent that I am on my own . 
< PROPFEMALE > and I went to the carnival ! It was so much fun !!! 
Stop text message me , people ! I won't get your message . 
After being up all night , my kid accidentally headbutted me and gave me a black eye ... again . Being a mom is awesome . 
86 days until Halloween . 
Snakes , and spiders , and bees ... oh , my ! 
Stick bugs are gross !!! 
I need a change . 
Seriously ... some people need to wipe the sand from their vaginas . 
My roommates are all gone for the night , < PROPMALE > went back up to the bay area indefinitely ... and after an hour of trying to get < PROPFEMALE > to go to sleep and FINALLY succeeding .... I realized I have no idea what to do with myself . What the hell did I do before I had a kid ??? I can't remember ... 
< PROPFEMALE > starts daycare tomorrow morning ! I know I'm going to be the one with separation anxiety ! 
Why are kids halloween costumes so freakin ' expensive ?! 
HAPPY HALLOWEEN !!!! 
I love < PROPFEMALE > . 
FREEDONIA ! I was going to go to sleep early , but ... nevermind ! 
Oprah took over the Discovery Health channel ! Now where will I get to see autopsies , people bleeding from their eyes , eight limbed individuals and liver demons ?! WHERE ?!?! I can't find the symbols to accurately express my super unhappy face . 
I can't believe it took me an hour to post something on Craigslist ! Thanks internet connection ! 
< PROPFEMALE > is singing the Alphabet Song . That's rad .

This might be the worst Easter ever . 
Where's the warm weather ??? I need sun . I look like I belong in Interview with the Vampire . Not attractive . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > makes me happy . 
Is there a place where I could find coupons for the < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Zoo ? $11 for a two year old ??? The girl is gonna call all the animals dogs .... and that's $11 ?!?! 
I hate staying up late . If I'm up too late , then I get hungry . When I'm hungry , I can't sleep . Then I think about all the awesome food that is NOT in my kitchen .... before you know it I'm craving massive cheeseburgers and pie . Mmmm ... pie-sized cheeseburgers ... why are you haunting me ?! 
You ever look at the ads on Craigslist just to see what weird crap people are selling ? One night I found a row of antique theater seating , throwing knives , a unicycle , a gorilla suit and a stripper pole . That would be one hell of a show , wouldn't it ?! Step right up ! Line forms to the left ! 
I need to own a large farm , so I can take in all the unwanted dogs of the world :( 
I'm going to KILL KILL KILL ... the insects in my yard . They can run , but they can't hide ! Insect genocide makes me happy :) 
Today is the day to cross everything of my to do list . Insect killing ... check . Gardening ... check . Weed killing ... check . Only 99 things left to do today . I think I need one of those novelty beer hats with the straws that go to your mouth . Only instead of beer , I'll have coffee . 
\Love is a condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own . \ " - < PROPFIRST > Anson Heinlein " 
Cloudy with a < PROPMALE > of Meatballs ... BEST MOVIE EVER ! 
My kid has just learned to howl at the < PROPFEMALE > . Strange ... I was just thinking about how much I missed having a dog ! 
\I have nothing to declare but my genius . \ " - < PROPFIRST > Wilde ( As he was being passed through customs ) " 
After all my complaining about how I never get a minute to myself , the baby tucks herself into bed and is asleep by eight . It's kinda like winning the lotto and not knowing what to do with the money . Man , I'm bored . 
Glad I have the cutest kid in the world to cheer me up when I'm sick . 
I woke up a zombie today . I need a brain . My brain seems to have rotted out of my ear sometime last night . BRAINS !!! 
I have no < PROPFEMALE > for poetry . 
I finally saw Avatar last night . Did anyone else realize it's the story of Pocahontas with ten foot tall smurfs ? In the second one , lil ' Pocahontas will go with Sulley to Earth , where she will catch some white man disease and die . I know , because I too have seen Disney movies , just like < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > . 
Who's < PROPFEMALE>'s favorite singer ? < PROPMALE > Bridges . It's 11:00 at night . < PROPMALE > and I are trying to watch a movie ... and < PROPFEMALE > is dancing around the living room like a drunk girl in a saloon . 
Doomed to a life with no VCR ! Had mine a few weeks and it's broken ! Just my luck ! 
I'm in yard sale heaven . 
I can't sleep . I'm wondering if I should say screw it and go make some coffee and .... uh ... that's all I have so far . I least I know what's important . 
Change is inevitable , except from vending machines . 
< PROPFIRST > Hopper just died ! 
Thanks to all of your birthday wishes ! I wish I could have spent it with all of you . Maybe next year we'll get together ... when I turn 29 again . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > went and cut off his hair . It's really bumming me out . :( 
\Shit ! Oh 
I need to make some extra money ... ugh ... 
Does anyone remember the cartoon < PROPFEMALE > Gold and Action < PROPFIRST > ? 
There should be a new rating for movies . \This movie is rated D for Depressing . Some situations may make you want to off yourself . \"" 
For several reasons , I'm feeling kinda old today . It probably doesn't help that I'm wearing my glasses and squinting while trying to read subtitles on a 50\ tv . " 
No fun having a sick baby :( 
Kids do sleep ... right ?! 
Zombies hate fast food . 
Getting the internet hooked up tomorrow . No more texting this s# ! + on my phone ! Woo Hoo ! I haven't had my computer hooked up to internet in so long , I'll have no idea what to do with it when I get it ! 
One of these days I'll be done cleaning up the aftermath of the biblical flood around my place .... One day ... 
I find it a little strange that there are several copies of < PROPFIRST > Strummer's biography , at the Dollar Tree . 
Finally saw Trick r ' Treat , tonight . I couldn't help but notice that the story of the grouchy old man in the house ( minus the bus full of dead special < PROPMALE>'s ) was almost exactly like an episode or movie short , I saw many years ago . Was the story from Tales From the Crypt ? Anyone ??? It's WAY too late for this to be bugging me ... plus , I want to tell < PROPMALE > \See ! I told you so ! \"" 
It's official ... Nick and I are having baby #2 ! 
Is there anything more hillarious than < PROPMALE > Python cross-dressing ?! I don't think I can ever get enough of it ! 
< PROPFEMALE > finally has a little kid to play with this week ... and she gets sick ! So much for that playdate . 
It finally cooled off enough to open the windows and cool off the house before bed . However , a skunk has decided to do his stinky business outside . Eww . Bad skunk . Bad . 
I can't wait to go to the dentist on Tuesday ! I hope I come back with one less wisdom tooth ! Until then , I will eat lots of ice cream ( at least there's that ) . 
It's best that people don't piss me off in the morning before my second cup of coffee . 
Cleaned the house and put < PROPFEMALE>'s new bed together . I'm EXHAUSTED ... and it's ONLY 4:30 ?! How is that ?!?! 
Watching < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST>'s Superhumans for the first time . I didn't know it existed . What a cool show . 
I love that my daughter can't pronounce her name . It's so cute . 
I love this weather ! 
I'm teaching the baby how to use the computer so she can play her games . It's so cute ! She's so proud of herself . 
Rootbeer floats and Ziggy Stardust . Rad . 
Wow ... the baby is asleep already ... I just found < PROPFEMALE > I didn't know I had ... AND Casino is on tv ! I'm not saying anymore ' cos I ain't gonna jinx it ! 
< PROPMALE > and I got a free 20 gallon fish tank for < PROPFEMALE > . We were super excited . Not so excited that < PROPFEMALE > saw it and ran to grab her fishing pole . 
Took < PROPFEMALE > to Target to look at Halloween costumes last night . She keeps talking about being an elephant for trick or treating . So , this morning I go on the computer , find a nice pattern for an elephant costume . When I show it to her , she informs me that she now wants to be .... a ham and cheese sandwich . True story . 
If ever I'm missing a dvd , all I have to do is look in the vcr . 
would gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today . 
WooHoo !!! It's October ... horror and Halloween movies all month ! 
Coffee . 
< PROPMALE > and I just saw the new < PROPMALE > movie and it occured to me ... < PROPFIRST > Depp should be in another Nightmare on Elm Street movie . It can be titled Nightmare on Elm Street : Back From the Bed . 
Pumpkin Poptarts are awesome . 
Is it weird that I'm stoked that < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > is going to be on the Wonder Pets tomorrow morning ??? 
\True friends stab you in the front . \"- < PROPFIRST > Wilde " 
It would be easier to watch the Scream Awards if < PROPFEMALE > would just go to bed and I didn't have to keep covering her eyes . Err ... kids . 
< PROPMALE > and I bought < PROPFEMALE > a toy doctor < PROPFEMALE > . I caught her giving her Halloween pumpkin a physical . I heard it cough . 
There just isn't enough coffee this morning ... 
Thanks to < PROPFEMALE > , all I can think about is eating sprinkle covered sprinkles in Germany . I'll just add that to my small list of cravings . Thanks , dude . 
Pumpkin cheesecake pancakes are awesome . 
< PROPFEMALE > just started talking about Christmas . I haven't even bought my damn turkey yet ! This girl celebrates holidays two month in advance ! 
I hate it when < PROPMALE>'s work gets slow . Just more things for us to worry about . 
I love that it's only 60 degrees outside , but not happy about the frost advisory . There goes the rest of < PROPFEMALE>'s garden ! :( 
Does anyone have dish network ? If so , do you know if it's possible to block specific t.v. shows from being watched ? 
I think I lost my brain ... but I can't remember when or where ... 
Just found out ... Nick and I are having another girl ! 
I'm not having fun picking out names for the baby . 
< PROPFEMALE > decided to put my make-up on today . She took the goopiest red vinyl lip stain and used it for mascara . There's nothing more awesome than going to a doctors appointment with a toddler who looks like she literally got a hot poker in the eye . Kids are freakin ' adorable ... 
Happy Birthday to the man I worship ... < PROPFIRST > SINATRA ! 
I am not ready for a week of rain . I'll go crazy , I tells ya .... CRAZY !!! 
Celebrating < PROPFEMALE>'s birthday today ! Cake and a movie ... it's a perfect day for it ! Can't believe she turns 3 tomorrow ! 
< PROPMALE > is finally the owner of his own screen printing company ! T-shirts , anyone ? 
I can't handle anymore of these help-the-horribly-abused-animal commercials from the aspca ! I have no money , but if they promise to stop bumming me out 20 times a day , I promise to one day be an loving animal hoarder . 
< PROPFEMALE > ( late ) Christmas to everyone and their families ! I would now like to hibernate until winter is over ... 
Arsenic and Old Lace , The Twilight Zone , and The Three Stooges . That's why it's okay to be stuck inside today ! 
I really wish it was the end of March already ! >:( 
My dad got me a new 76 pc . tool set ! Woo hoo ! I'm fixing EVERYTHING today ! Fun ! 
I fixed my digital camera !!! Sure , it took more than two and a half years of thinking about what was wrong with it and , well , 20 seconds to actually fix it ... but I still feel like a genius ! No more taking pictures with my phone !!! I can zoom ! 
My poor kid just bruised her face ! I like how she now has to blame something . She said her < PROPFEMALE > chair jumped up and hit her in the cheek ! That means she was doing some dare devil trick she wasn't supposed to be doing . 
I just caught my kid singing Goo Goo Muck ! AWESOME .

Amazing ! < PROPFEMALE > managed to get a black eye ... again ! 
Coming up on the nightly news : Three year-olds . Cute or possessed by Satan ? More news at ten . 
My car is named MC Pee Pants . It's old and losing control of its fluids :( 
Pop Tarts are nothing but breakfast cookies . 
I hate not being able to sleep . I'm so bored ! 
< PROPFEMALE > went to sleep early for once . I'm eating in my room and watching Evil Dead 2 ... and there's no little person trying to steal my food or switch the channel to Cartoons . I kinda feel like a grown up ! Woohoo ! Chainsaws ! 
43 more days until I get to evict this kid . Oh , yes ... the count down is on . I would like to be able to tie my frickin ' shoes soon ! 
< PROPFEMALE > III ?! The < PROPMALE > has to know by now that this woman is clearly too much trouble . He should have gone with an arranged marriage . 
< PROPFEMALE > likes Snow White a lot . She told me to make a wish and then tried to kill me with a poison Cheerio . 
I hate the wind . I'm afraid if I go outside a house will fall on me . 
For the rest of February please change your profile image to your dog , cat or favorite animal . The object ? Not to see a human face on FB until Feb . 28 . This is a campaign to raise awareness against the cruelty of animals . 
I'm in the mood to throw everything in the trash today . Maybe that'll keep things from being thrown on my floor . 
I spend more time in the morning looking for my misplaced cup of coffee , than actually drinking my cup of coffee . 
Bags are meant to be super cute accessories , not things on my face . Is it bedtime yet ? 
This day should win the award for the most unproductive and least relaxing day ever . 
My kid and I are sick and the medicine and Goofy movies aren't working . Tomorrow we're getting serious ... Pee Wee and juice ! 
Dear HGTV and food network , do not refer to installing new toilets and making chicken-fried steak as \sexy\ " . It's creepy and weird . That is all . " 
AHHH ! HULK SMASH !!! 
I'm so happy ! I just got an awesome new stroller from my friend < PROPFEMALE > ! It's rad ! 
Has anyone ever played with < PROPFEMALE > Dough ? Is it as awesome as it looks in the commercials or is it just Play-Doh that gets all dried out ? 
So , for some reason , all messages today get sent before I'm actually done typing . I'm not trying to be short with anyone ... I think my computer hates me !
