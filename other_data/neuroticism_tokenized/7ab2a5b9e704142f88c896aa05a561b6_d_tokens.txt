Okay , so- when we were installing our new carpet , I took my cats to the vet to get them declawed so that the $ 3,000 frieze would not be torn to shreds- now < PROPFIRST > is ripping the corner of the stairs up with her teeth !!

I'm ready to have a better new year ... and hoping that everyone else does too !! 
Happy New Year !! I hope everyone has a VERY prosperous 2011 !! My New Years resolution : to lose 15 pounds ( lose the fat and gain muscle ! ) , to work on my spirituality , learn to love those who I dislike , and to celebrate and spoil with those who love me unconditionally !! 
Loving the weather !! Thanks be to God !! Thank you lord for not making me nipply during the night ... for sparing the expense of turning on the heat in the house- one more time ! YOW !! 
Had a great time today- went to a new church ( Westside ) , shopped at the commissary with my mom- while the guys played golf at Ironwood- it was so refreshing ! Things to do : get a massage , sandblast my feet- i.e. pedicure , remodel the upper bathroom and laundryroom , and spring clean ! 
Yippity skippy ... I was just told in the ER that I have a right orbit and maxilla facial fracture ! I am totally bummed ... I have to call my plastic surgeon tomorrow ... yikes ! 
Looks like surgery for me early next week- I saw Dr. Bruneteau today and he told me I would need a plastic plate put in on the soft bone right around and under my eyeball ( basically taking the eye out of it's socket ) , as well as fix my cheek bone area- LOVELY !! NOT looking forward to it ! 
Okay ... so much to do ... Randy and < PROPMALE > are going to < PROPFIRST > for the Robotics Championships ... laundry ... a never ending quest !!

OH Dear God : please make it 70 and < PROPFEMALE > again !! Thanks ! 
Facial surgery for me today ... wish me luck ! Say a prayer ... :) 
A sign I'm getting old : I am excited about getting the new Kenmore Elite steam washer and dryer in red chili pepper !

got my stitches out yesterday ... my eye area still feels like bugs are crawling around under my skin and it is still numb . I'm thinking it's the nerve endings trying to repair themselves . Despite that , I am remodeling my laundry room for my new Kenmore Elite washer and dryer- which will be delivered next Tuesday- VERY HAPPY for the arrival of my shiny new red babies !! 
Off to painting my laundry room- OH what fun !! I will have to rock out ... hmm- what to listen to ? Maybe some Ferry Corsten or Armin < PROPFIRST > Buuren . 
Okay ... do not know why someone would schedule me 2:30 - 8:30 with only a 15 minute break- how is a person supposed to eat dinner in 15 minutes ?! 
Time to get off my ars and start painting my laundry room ... hopefully the foreign telemarketer ( who is representing an AMERICAN company- uh-hum ! ) comprehended I would be around to accept the delivery of my new washer and dryer ! 
is finally going to bed ... hopefully < PROPFIRST > isn't snoring his ass off

is so grateful for everything/everyone in my life- thank you God !! I am going to learn and continue to grow ! 
FREE FOOD !! I need some hungry friends over here ... cause some family members have flaked out on me and now I am left with a double batch of Sicilian Sauce with Italian sausage and garlic bread ! I so wish I lived in a small town ... sometimes :) 
So another tree in our backyard has a huge chunk out of it from last night's storm ... and we have a baby squirrel in a box in the garage ( < PROPFIRST > even put some acorns in there ! ) ... anyone know how to take care of a baby squirrel ? 
is going to see my plastic surgeon today about my eye ... I hope he doesn't give me the runaround about the place near my eyebrow where there is clearly a raised , hardened bump ( he put a screw or something in there fit for a linebacker ! ) ... It has only been about 3 months from surgery , but I can't see this going away . 
My God ... Randy is trying to tell me that < PROPFIRST > Bush Jr. didn't have any knowledge of 9/11 ... being in TX- he is friends with the bin-laden family !!! UH-HUM !! 
< PROPFIRST > is cooking ribs for din din- complete with cornbread , corn on the cob ( on the grill ) , coleslaw and all the fixin's!! He is using the \smooth and spicy\ " Grandma < PROPMALE>'s BBQ sauce ... should be YUMMY !! " 
A quote I need to heed : \Don't let fear steal your destiny\ " - < PROPFEMALE > Meyer "

OH today has to be awesome- I'm going to force it to !! 
is excited to be getting rid of her nappy roots today ... AND NO < PROPMALE > - you ARE NOT chopping anything off !! 
< PROPFIRST > and I got into a motorcycle accident on Saturday- a car swiped our bike on the left side and hit our feet- it was a hit and run- we miraculously made it to Clarkson emergency room ... I have a broken fibula ( ankle ) , but < PROPFIRST > has severely injured his foot- he may lose his foot . He is at the Nebraska Medical Center- PLEASE PRAY FOR HIM !! Thanks for your thoughts and prayers . 
Thanks to all for the thoughts and prayers for < PROPFIRST > and I- we feel incredibly blessed with all of the love and support from everyone . Unfortunately- he will be getting seven inches below the knee along with his ( left ) foot amputated tomorrow afternoon . < PROPFIRST > is doing fine despite the news ... the road ahead will be long- but with love , we will persevere through these times . Much love to all of our friends and family . 
< PROPFIRST > is doing well from surgery- the prosthesis guy came in yesterday and measured his left leg for a limb protector , and in 6 weeks he ought to have the final prosthetic he will wear for life ( there are three stages ) . Hopefully he will be coming home either today or tomorrow . Thanks again for all of the love , prayers , and well wishes from our friends :) 
I totally miss my house , my job ( the customers I meet and most especially my co-workers ) , my daughter full-time ( who is now at her Dad's house ) , my friends , and the freedom to go anywhere I want at anytime ... I know this is a lesson from God- I am definitely learning < PROPFEMALE > and a deeper appreciation for everything , but I have to admit I feel lonely and removed from everything- it is so frustrating ! 
I'm going home tomorrow ... just to < PROPFEMALE > out- I feel like shit . I'm leaving early . 
13 more days till my cast is off ... cannot wait ! I hope I won't even need a walking cast after the other comes off !! I also hope the weather will cooperate in letting me finish the summer projects that were left unfinished by the accident- I still have some painting to do ... 
I'm officially in lust with nearly every hunky handyman on HGTV/DIY ... and envious of their wives- they get husbands who care about updating/designing- and the paycheck from being on television- GEESH !! 
Ugh- I feel gross ... I think I am going to hop ( < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > ) into the shower and then read the < PROPFEMALE > Michaels book , \Master Your Metabolism\ " that is collecting dust on my coffee table . It's time to make a positive life change- especially since the big 4-0 is fast approaching !! " 
From < PROPFEMALE > Michaels : Fun Fact I \ 
just read : If you eat a typical amount of beef ( 66.5 pounds a year ) , \ 
switching to < PROPFEMALE > grassfed beef will save you 17,733 calories a \ 
year—without requiring any willpower or change in your eating habits . If\ 
everything else in your diet remains constant , you'll lose about six \ 
pounds a year . If all Americans switched to grassfed meat , our national epidemic of obesity might diminish . 
Well- I got my cast off yesterday ! Never in my life have I been so ready to get rid of something ! No more crutches- WHEW ! I am now wearing a boot for at least the next 2 weeks and have to go through physical therapy twice a week for a month . I never thought I'd say this but I am so excited to be ABLE to do laundry ! 
< PROPFIRST > and the boys are in South < PROPFEMALE > hunting this weekend- it already feels WONDERFUL- since we have been house bound together for the past couple of months ( I truly wanted to stab him with my crutch a few times ! ) ... hmmm- maybe my motto will be , \while the cats away- the mouse will play !! \"" 
So- I think I will venture out to Barnes and < PROPMALE > to see if they have another book in a series I am reading ... Charlaine < PROPMALE > - Living Dead in Dallas ... ( I guess it is based on the HBO series True Blood- I will have to rent those too ! ) 
Three to homecoming at < PROPMALE > North tonight ... Nathan is the first home-Whew ! 
Just chillin ' tonight ... about to organize the basement ... UGH !! I can't count how many times I've been to the Goodwill in the past few months- feels good to purge though :) 
I like it wherever is convenient for me to lay it down !! 
< PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > are putting together the BOND ROCHESTER firebowl I bought ... YEE HAWW- gotta love ambience during the \colder\ " fall months !! " 
< PROPFIRST > walked for the first time today in 2 1/2 months- he got to try on his prosthetic limb ! It was really cool seeing him use two legs and he didn't even have to < PROPFEMALE > on to the parallel bars ! They are going to tweak everything and he should be getting the first prosthetic he will use ( for the next 6 mos . ) on Wednesday ... Talk about Christmas in October !! 
OH parent/teacher conferences today- there better not be any surprises !! Or else I'm gonna lay the smack down !! 
OMG- < PROPFIRST > put on the mullet wig for my party ... TOTALLY HILARIOUS !! He said all he wanted back then was to be able to put a part of his hair in his mouth ... OMG- the wig brought back memories for him LOL !!! COMEDY !! Let me tell you people- we have been through LOTS- YET- FREE FOOD AND BEER- and the utmost care you can imagine afterwards :) 
Thank you to everyone for the birthday wishes !!!! AND- most importantly a special thanks to my friends who came to my party on Friday to help me celebrate- I love you guys soooo much !!! I have had the most fabulous weekend- couldn't have asked for anything better !! 
Wow the calmness of my house ... It is truly bittersweet- I miss everyone and < PROPFIRST > is back at work today- I almost feel like a mother who just sent her kid off to his first day of kindergarten !! He will do fine- I know . For me- I just hope the doctor gives me the go ahead ( appt . 10/28 ) to get back to selling bras and panties- < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > !! 
Just love it when the truck won't start !! Today I am getting a CT scan on my ankle to see whats going on- my orthopedic doctor said my X-Rays don't look favorable :( After that I will be getting an MRI to examine the soft tissues , etc . Keep your fingers crossed that I will be fine ... I am going nuts not being able to exercise and everything !! 
Mmmm < PROPFIRST > is making french toast and bacon this morning- YUMMY !! I will have to give him a trick for his treat- Happy Halloween !! ;)

Happy Thanksgiving to all of my wonderful family and friends !!! I am so grateful for having an awesome husband , great kids , and most of all- my life- which was spared from a motorcycle accident- thanks be to GOD !! 
OMG- I have to be to work at 5:45 a.m. !! UHMMM- I am glad that I am not a rocket scientist , but on the other hand- at < PROPFEMALE>'s Secret- dealing with women who want what they want when they want it ... could put the two jobs on the same stress level !!! 
Christmas decorating with the hubby ... and along the way- cleaning the homestead as we go ! We are listening to Christmas classics and lighting candles- the perfect ambience !! 
Loading swag ... \

OMG- < PROPFIRST > is traveling tomorrow ... hence airport security- it's kinda ironic considering he has a top secret security clearance !! But still- I offered to buy him some of the athletic \tear away\ " pants- so he could strip quickly without having to wear just his skivvies to the airport !!! " 
How do you feel when history repeats itself in your life ?! 
SO- I had the most amazing day with my son Aaron ... of course- not usual- but , he knows what he is getting for Christmas ... It kind of changes when you get older I guess- he tried on shoes ( I bought them ) , he tried on jeans at the Buckle ( I bought them ) , he wanted an Affliction thermal ( I bought that too :) ... He will still have surprises in his stocking :) 
Here's to laundry ... and I'm the only one who truly knows how to do it !! :) 
My friend < PROPFEMALE>'s husband- < PROPMALE > and his brother- < PROPFIRST > were on a missions trip to Mexico ... they were in a horrible accident . The family made a video of the whole ordeal . This is probably the most touching video I've ever watched ... here is the link ; you have to see this ! \

Looks like I am still on my own no matter what ( < PROPFIRST > is getting money from losing his leg- even though I feel the repercussions EVERY DAY ! ) ... he is wanting to do so many things that I am not cool with ... geez- I feel like I am single(d ) out ... UH WAIT- MAYBE I AM ?!!! 
Now listen up ... she's a razor sharp ...

UGH- got the stomach flu ... I really want to eat something but I can't!! Not fun !! 
My daughter < PROPFEMALE > is 16 today !! Another driver in the house ... Wow- how time has flown by quickly !! 
< PROPFIRST > and his boys headed out this morning to Kansas City to watch the Chiefs game at Arrowhead and I am left here all by my lonesome ( sniffle , sniffle- NOT ! ) to do some online shopping- what a trade off !! Should I dare say , \Go Ravens ?! \ " LOL !! " 
Organic milk tastes sooooo much better than the regular stuff !! So fresh ... looks like I will be shopping more at Whole Foods !! I think I am going to try < PROPMALE > bread next ... 
Just booked our tickets to Puerto Vallarta , Mexico !!! We are leaving in April and traveling with our dearest friends , the McAnally's and JoJo !! CANNOT WAIT !!! This definitely means I need to get to the gym- WHAT motivation !! 
This year we will experience 4 unusual dates : 1/1/11 , 11/1/11 , 1/11/11 , and 11/11/11 . Now , in light of that , take the last 2 digits of the year you were born , plus the age you will be this year , and what does it equal ? Yes , 111\ 
and for kids , its 11 .. freaky ! 
Day 1 of personal training ... a guy named < PROPFIRST > is going to start whipping me into shape at 24 hour Fitness !! Not looking forward to the calipers ... I'm sure I have at least 20% body fat ... Right now I weigh 136- my goal is 118-120 :) 10 weeks- I can do it !! 
Time for < PROPFEMALE > Michaels to kick my behind ... I am finally starting the 30 day shred video in conjunction with my personal training !! I swear I could barely pick up a panty at work last night !! But- it will be sooooo worth it !! 
Awww- I am taking < PROPFEMALE > to her first job interview for a cashiering position at Bag n Save ... I coached her on interviewing- tips , what to say , etc . Cross your fingers for her !! 
So- I have lost 4 pounds so far in a little over 2 weeks and 4.5 inches from my body measurements ! YAY !! I have at least 14 pounds to go by April 10th !
