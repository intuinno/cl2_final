I just looked at my Comcast bills . Since he moved in January 1 , my roommate has racked up in excess ever$200 in on-demand movie charges ... he didn't think to tell me about it .

Paid off my bank of < PROPFEMALE > visa card just now . The one that jacked my interest up to 29.99% when I was broke and had a balance in excess of 13 grand . B of A was milking me for $300 a month just in interest . I still need to pay off a citibank ( 16.99% ) and amex card ( 13.24% ) but it was my personal bank that decided to kick me when I was down . I will never borrow money from B of A again .

feeling overwhelmed at the moment 
When you sleep , where do your fingers go ? Do they tremble on the edge of the bed , or do you fold them neatly by your head ?

Are they scratching their nails on the blackboard of death only seeking attention after everyone else has left ?
