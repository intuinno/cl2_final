I need that spark to get psyched back up , in order for me to pick my life back up 

u just never know 
I'm just so fucking depressed , I just can't seem to get out this slump If I could just get over this hump , but I need something to pull me out this dump I took my bruises , took my lumps , fell down and I got right back up But I need that spark to get psych 
Nobody asked for life to deal us with these bullshit hands we're dealt We gotta take these cards ourselves and flip em dont expect no help Now i could have either just stayed at home sit on my ass and pissed and moaned Or take this situation with which im 
I dont know how or why or when I ended up this position im in Im started to feel distant again 
.... 
So dark and so cold my friends don't know this other side of me There's a monster inside of me it's quite ugly and it frightens me But they can't see what I can see there's a vacancy in my tummy 
I know love , ' cause I've flown above and beyond , but it's still too long of a wait . 
tryin to make it 
long day at work gotta be up at 5 hittin the bed . ( cell phone is broke . ) 
when u loose everything you can find meaning in anything 
im sick and tired of you'll be fine . how do u know ? can u read minds ? 
Now i see the times they change Leaving us , it seems so strange I am hoping i can find Where to leave my hurt behind All the shit i seem to take All alone i seem to break I have lived the best i can Does this make me not a man ? 
Well this relationship fodder don't mean to bother nobody But Cupid's automatic musta fired multiple shots at her Because she fall in love too often that's what the matter At least I talk about it keep a pattern of flattery

wishing I knew what god had planed for me . 
Got my truck finally . 
Loving the new truck and this beautiful day . This day is only missing one thing to be perfect . She knows who she is . 
a restless night thinking about her . Lord help me see what I need to do .

He wont get out again some wire and duct tape can fix any house hold problem ! 
Romans 14:8 if we live we live to the if we die we die to the lord . So whether we live or die we belong to the lord 
My mustang gets t boned then totaled out . I'm out two weeks worth of pay because of a medical leave from work . Bills are due . Wont see another check till the 21st . A piece of my back tooth chipped off standing at work somehow . But theres still a girl that can make me smile through all of it . Thank god for her because with out her this could have been a bad month . lol 
What I've felt , what I've known Sick and tired , I stand alone Could you be there ?, ' cause I'm the one who waits for you Or are you unforgiven too ? 
Just when u think things cant get any worse , the world proves u wrong . Iv never lost hope before but even i have a breaking point . I passed it up today . 
why couldn't I have been going one mph faster when I got t boned so it would have hit my door ? 
layin down to get some shut eye . wonder what goes wrong today ? maybe my luck will change . I wont say things can't get worse because iv yet to see any truth to that saying lol 
the hell of it is what we are We finish and wish we could start again Our skin tears away as Our memories fade with age And we don't even know ' til it's gone ? But everything just fell apart ' Cause everything just falls apart for me\ 
So woe is me It all falls apart you see So woe it me it all fell apart 
The world it just ain't right . \ 
It keeps me up at night . \ 
Try to be satisfied , \ 
but I'm still in love with you , \ 
but it's not like you want me to . 
I am no Superman I have no answers for you I am no hero oh that's forsure but I do know one thing , where you are is where I belong ... 
sometimes I feel so alone , I just don't know , feels like I been down this road before , So lonely and cold , It's like something takes over me , Soon as I go home and close the door , Kinda feels like < PROPFEMALE > vu , I wanna get away from this place I do , But I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don'tAnd why I just don't know ...

Ever feel like you'll never be enough ? 
gotta love McDonald's breakfast 
wtf am I supposed to do , whenever I think its about you , but no matter what i say , in some kinda impossible way , I seem to keep makin a mistake , its like a dream from which I cant seem to wake , I know it can't be to late , to prove us meeting was fate , iv known love and no when its fake , cause u get a feelin u cant seem to shake . and theen feelin is me 
sleep take me away , turn this night into day . when I wake ill see the light , but only briefly because I work at night .

Had a hell of a time at my party at the sawmill . didn't expect so many of my friends and family to be there . thanks everyone for gettin tore down with me and makin a memorable night . 
Life keeps throwing me curves but luckily I know how to use my ebrake . a roommate moved out over the weekend and shut off the power . don't have enough to make the deposit so candle lit b day tomorrow better be the the shit lol 
time for bed work was long . thinking about taking a vacation wendsday and spending a few days in b ville 
knock on the door hope isn't home , fates not around the lucks all gone . don't ask me what's wrong ask me what's right and ima tell you whats right 
I feel like iv done all that I can , but if I couldn't make you happy am I a man ? I can feel myself breakin back apart , I can feel the insanity start , to plant its seeds in my mind . roots spreading what's it find ? it gonna find I'm about to break its cage , bust out in an impossible rage . be cause I've done faced my demons , and my resolve they could not weaken . ima stay strong I can do no wrong 
ima take hold of this depression , court is now in session . will the jury be seated , this mans been mistreated . he's been chewed up and spit out , he's out of hope filled with doubt . 
FML I'm single again ...... 
heads killing me I finally fell asleep and all I did is dream about her . I can't stand her not being beside me right now when I need it most . how can this have happened . fml pray for me and her 
still can't sleep , eat , or think about anything else . I feel a migraine coming on . iv tried my best to treat her right and to be without her feels so wrong 
never got any sleep still can't eat . today feels like a nightmare from which I will not awake . I'm not sure how much more I can take 
still in a dream . at least now iv hurt enough to feel numb . 
still a mess but I have to go to work later . I need some prayers to pull myself together . I still love u < PROPFEMALE > .... 
romans 10:9 -13 love must be sincere . hate what is evil ; cling to what is good . be devoted to one another in brotherly love . honor one another above yourselves . never be lacking in zeal , but keep your spiritual fervor serving the lord . be joyful in hope , patient in affliction , faithful in prayer . 
o yea almost forgot I'm moving back to burkesville Wednesday 
I'm getting a little better . I can hold a little food down but trying to sleep in this bed without her is giving me nightmares . she won't take me back .... I'm sure of it now . I had everything I wanted just by being with her . But now that I'm nothing I can remake myself into whatever I want : ) 
romans 14:8 if we live , we live to the lord and if we die , we die to the lord . so whether we live or die we belong to the lord . 
What's on my mind ? the future . 
can't stop dreaming about her .... 
iv been trying so hard to ignore this feeling but the truth is I'm still just as in love . 
thank god for answered prayers . if I wasn't getting up around 4 then I believe I would get the best night of sleep iv had in awhile . its nice having your faith rewarded when u hear a prayer answered . it may not be the answer u prayed for but u know its the right one . 
moving in the morning 
about to start movin to b ville 
done moving to b ville . realizing now that everybody I know has moved away . 
wishing I could see a certain someone right about now 
beautiful day with a beautiful girl named < PROPFEMALE > in my mind . thank u lord for putting her in my life 
no matter what I do I feel like I mess up somehow 
on lunch break might get off early . god give me the strength to continue living with a smile when happiness seems to elude me . 
feeling like I'm backed up in a corner . how much do i have to go through before u can catch a break . 
thinking of how happy I once was not to long ago . 
I think everyone knows what I'm thinking about by now lol 
woke up tore up about her for some reason . iv been doing good but I guess not good enough . I'm headed to church . god plz calm the storm inside my heart 
had a great day now time for sleep . thank you lord for giving me everything I need to have a good day . I still have hope 
thank you lord for another great day 
just had an amazing dream of a past memory . 
you and me are the perfect team , when were together its like a dream . u make me smile and I make u wild . when im with u I feel like a child . because I become easy to please , but remember please don't tease . u love me or love me not , u stole cupids automatic and me u shot . 
not sure of anything anymore . I'm so damn confused . its amazing how fast things can turn on u . 
at the sawmill watchin the ufc ppv . thinkin of how much fun I had with her today . 
can't believe < PROPMALE > lost ... 
I'd do anything under this sun to get back what iv lost . this week would have been perfect if it wasn't for last night . idk whats gonna happen but either way ill never be the same . never take what time u get with someone for granted . 
ill do whatever it takes . when I'm with you I get the shakes . my body aches when I aint with you I have zero strength . there's no limit on how far I would go no boundaries no lengths why do we say that till we get that person we thinks , gonna be the one then once we get em its never the same . u want em when they don't want u 
I wasn't looking when I stumbled on to you must have been fate but so much is at stake . what the fuck does it take let's cut to the < PROPMALE > before the door shuts in your face . promise me if I cave in and break that I won't be makin a mistake 
just promise me you'll think of me every time you look up in the sky and see a < PROPFEMALE > .... 
I'm the logo on the < PROPFIRST > cowboy helmet . \ 
The < PROPFEMALE > , I'm not giving up til I get my respect , and I wont stop til I get enough , \ 
cuz I'm not livin up to my own expectations 
I'm stronger than you know ... 
I'm an idiot to think for a second that .... 
when I think I'm strong u make me weak ....... 
high off of love drunk from the hate its like I'm huffin paint and I love it the more I suffer . I suffocate then right before I'm about to drown she resuscitates me she fuckin hates me and I love it 
stick a fork in me because im done ......

nothing is better than hearing what you want to hear and knowing its true 
Finally installed the cd player that got myself for my birthday . Got it in september and it took this long to get in my damn truck lol
