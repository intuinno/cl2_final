Just when you think you can trust someone , they go back on their word and screw you over 
life is what you make of it . You chose to be happy , pissed , angry , sad ......... normal , abnormal , stressed , extatic , bliss ...... it really is how you handle it

don't pretend to know what love is for everyone , but love is knowing all about someone , & still wanting \ 
to be with them more than any other person . Trusting them enough\ 
to tell them everything about yourself , including the things you might \ 
be ashamed of . Feeling comfortable & safe with someone , but \ 
still getting weak when they walk into a room & smile at you . 
Havent played rockband2 drums in a long time ..... arms are killing me !
