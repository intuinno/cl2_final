Just think of all of our ' inter-relations ' this last century , first enemies , then superlative students of freedom and last deeply connected allies and friends ! 
How many remember March 28th 1979 ? This was the date of the Three Mile Island accident , I was in High School . This was a core meltdown , granted the uraneum did not get out of the reactor vessel , it ruined the TMI unit two area for hundreds of years to come . It seems TWO of the Japanese reactors could be in worse shape ... Holy COW !

Bloomsbury New Jersey for the night ... the last place to find a parking place before one get into the enormous congestion and sprawl of eastern New Jersey and New York affectionately lknown as \The City \""
