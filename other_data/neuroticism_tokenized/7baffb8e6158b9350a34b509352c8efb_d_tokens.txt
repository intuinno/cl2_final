Good-bye < PROPFEMALE > . I love you . 
My cell is freaking out so if you're having trouble getting hold of me that's why . The screen is dark . Anyone know a possible fix ? It's a Rival if that helps . P.S. Never buy a phone just bc it's purple !

\I do not want to go to school today said little < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > McKay ... \ " TSA Open House today . Must go to work . Must have coffee . LOTS of coffee . "

I'm testing the new privacy settings < PROPFEMALE > . If you can read this please respond with a comment . Thank you . We now return to your regularly scheduled program : D 
Had a great time seeing everyone at El Salto . What an outrageous , rowdy , fabulous bunch of folks we are :-D 
In the process of convincing herself it's time to go in to TSA & get some work done .

went to bed way early last night & is feeling much better this morning . HELLO Friday ! Woot woot ! :D 
time to tackle the laundry , UGH . 
is waiting on the dryers at the laundromat , & she STILL hates the laundromat . It lost any charm it may have held a good five or more years ago . Ugh :P 
loves her friends ! OMG Dauel & < PROPFEMALE > are friggin HALARIOUS . Highly entertaining phone call this evening : D ROTFL 
had a lovely drive on the scenic back roads to Jolly < PROPMALE>'s for fresh fish . AND , they insisted she drive their sports car on the way there !!! Foolish mortals > : -> Nice break with routine , & great day to drive along the \north shore . \ " Bonus . . . no speeding tickets :) "

Off to a campfire . Happy Beltane ! 
Go Cavs , Go Cavs , Go Cavs !!! 
MUST go in to work in the morning . Wouldn't it be lovely if we didn't have to quantify things to give grades ? Ugh , reality is rearing it's ugly head :P 
is bummed she isn't watching the Cavs . Why isn't she watching the Cavs ? Because she is STILL grading . She will be grading until her eyes fall out . Leave comments to make her giggle !!! For she is dangerously close to losing her sense of humor :(

is surprisingly awake & looking forward to some coffee b4 the Making Strides Walk @ Levis Commons this morning . Remember , of course , \awake\ " is a relative term ; ) " 
still LOVES Friday nights , & , in spite of this fact , went walking with TEAM TSA @ the Strides for the Cure walk this morning ( That's right morning = a.m. AKA b4 noon ) . She especially loved the interlude of cold rain . Her hair is STILL poofy . Anyone headed back to Levis Commons tonight to see the Hep Cats play Fat Fish Blues ? 9:30 , right ? 
Rush to church ... Or ... take a leisurely shower ? I wonder which will win :P 
would like someone to explain to her why she has already been awake for an hour . SERIOUSLY . Who wakes up b4 five a.m. ? 
somebody let me know how the Cavs do . I don't think I'll get a < PROPMALE > to watch tonight :) 
long day tomorrow . I should really get to sleep soon . Hello Kaleidoscope 2010 ! Hello < PROPFEMALE > Bowersox parade ! Let the chaos ensue !!! 
is sleepy . 
insists no one attempt to contact her before noon ... today . Time to catch up on some much needed sleep ! Night all ... Zzzz . 
does not seem to understand how \iLike\ " functions . How do I see my friends songs ? " 
A true friend can go long periods of time without speaking and never question their friendship . Then pick up like they just spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been ........ REPOST if you are lucky enough to have at least one . 
needs to go to the laundromat again , ugh ! 
has voted for < PROPFEMALE > ( 1 866 436 5702 /04 /06 ) a dozen times . Mama Sox rocked it out tonight !!! 
Did < PROPFEMALE > win yet ?! 
has hit a wall : grading overload + final exams = * insert loud , long scream here * And , that's my two minutes of FB time this week :( 
Day one of exams over :-) Just four more days until I can officially enjoy summer ! 
overload meltdown predicted sometime early tomorrow morning :O 
One more day ! Then I get to check out for the summer !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Summer has officially arrived ! In fact , I start the summer gig Monday morning . It's all good though . I celebrated tonight :) 
I've been instructed to throw myself together & head over to watch the world cup game ( U.S. vs England ) today . Then I think it's off to a grad party . I'm sooo glad summer has FINALLY arrived ! Ooh , and as the song goes , \I went out last night\ " too :-D I LOVE SUMMER !!! " 
Teaching five - seven year olds is worlds apart from teaching eight & nine year olds . Good golly ! 
I'm procrastinating & therefore bored . However , if I stop procrastinating I'll have to go to the laundromat . We all know how much I hate going to the laundromat . I LOVE summer ! When my biggest dilema is to do laundry or not to do laundry . Summer makes me want to dance a lil ' jig :D 
is finally actually at the dreaded laundromat :P 
We have to talk about our noses now !!! It's a < PROPFEMALE > Convention !!! 
Yea ! In < PROPMALE > for a short weekend :) 
in theory ... pulled in to < PROPMALE > two hours ago . In practice . . . tomorrow is another day , one that will < PROPFEMALE > earlier than anticipated :) Looking forward to a few days in < PROPMALE > . 
Okay , so I called the parents to let them know I would be in town in about an hour . Immediately after I < PROPMALE > up my tire blew ! Changed it , moved on , FINALLY in town :D 
OMG . My car has made it back from the shop alive ; it had something like a near death experience . My bank account is about to experience the near death thing now :P However , I can now return to BG :) 
Has acquired one of those lovely trucker sunburns intense enough to paint white designs on in fingerprints . . . sooo special . Ouch ! 
Screw him ! One man does NOT a team make . Maybe this will open us up for some men who know how to play like a team ; something akin to the the Wilkens ' days of Price/Daughery/Nance/Ehlo ! Those are games I LOVED to watch !!! 
-Slings & Arrows- How is it that Netflix is the first I have heard of this AMAZING show ?! If you are a theater-goer & have not seen this show remedy your grievous error anon . 
1:30 Spain vs . Netherlands for the World Cup !!! My two favorites :) 
¡Olé , olé , olééé ! ¡Ganadores ! ¡Viva España ! 
I just deleted over 1,500 messages from my main e-mail account . I HATE junk mail . I need to block a few more companies . I probably got 20 parts junk for every valid message !!! 
wishes her body clock & sleep schedule were working the same shift . 
< PROPMALE > 
my have to rethink her five favorite movies . -Tea With Mussolini- is brilliant . 
is procrastinating .

New acquaintances , old friends , some pool , & a stop in The Grill . Nice evening off of rehearsal :) If only I hadn't sucked so hard at the pool tonight . Seriously ... EPIC FAIL :-D 
Well , that was an interesting evening . 
Needs to get sleepy . She's supposed to hit the gym in the morning . She will SOOO NOT be functional . Still on summer schedule .

Joined the gym & worked out this morning . Yea ! Even shot some baskets :)

Gotta do laundry & meet w the trainer tomorrow morning , in that order . I should get to sleep . 
Retreat today . ' Posed to get up early go to laundromat & gym . HA ! Sooo I'll be doing that this evening :) 
achy . 
It's raining . It's pouring . Why aren't the tractors at the pull a-roaring ? Not that I'm complaining , mind you , NOT AT ALL . 
NOW I can hear the tractor pull . I NEVER would have imagined that I would one day live in a town that is home to the national tractor pulling championship . Life is sooo bizarre . 
Last < PROPMALE > to catch The Great American Trailer Park Musical today ! Be at 1360 Dearborn Ave ., OREGON , OHIO , at 1:30 with a chair or a blanket to sit on ! 
THANK YOU SOOO MUCH everyone who came to see -The Great American Trailer Park Musical- !

is grading more tests . 
\Here comes the rain ... \"- The Mavericks " 
still can't sleep . Urg : < 
Tea & grading . 
I like it on the living room floor . 
-1 out of 10 people born is gay . That means 1 of every 10 people is instantly put down , given bad labels , left alone , put in a minority , and so much else -- all for something they didn't ask for . Many gay teens are going to commit suicide as a way of escaping . If you want to tell them life will get better and you respect them for who they are , copy and paste this . Most of you won't , but let's see the 5% who will ... 
is a straight ally and today is National Coming Out Day . I'm coming out for lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender equality because it's 2010 and almost 90% of LGBT youth experience harassment in school , and too many lives have been lost .

STILL grading . I've been working on grades since seven o'clock straight , well with one fifteen minute break . And , this time I had most of the grading in ahead of time ! Go figure . 
Obviously , I spent too much time writing comments on those report cards ! Serenity now ! 
Armadillo Acres is up and runnin'! I can't wait to sell me some flaaan :-D

Oh no ! Batería baja ! And , I still can't find my charger ! 
hello and good night < PROPMALE > . Got in late this evening , did a few chores , now time for some sleep before the pre-dinner chores commence . However , those are always accompanied by wine so they will be far more entertaining :-D 
Happy Thanksgiving ! 
Knows she has to head back to BG , but just can't convince herself to pack up the car :( Maybe after the game ? 
Got a flat on her way home tonight :( Must remember to call someone for a ride to work first thing in the a.m.

is thinking positive , is thinking positive , is thinking . . . oh hell . . . fml . 
Yea 4 < PROPMALE > , my knight in shiny < PROPMALE > , who jumped my car tonight !

Mom : < PROPFIRST > dear , would you make a cup of coffee ? \

Wow , FB just sucks the time away ! I just wanted to see what I missed the last couple days . Over an hour later . . . Must log off , must log off , must 
Aaah :] cup o ' < PROPFIRST > , some tunes , lets grade ! 
One hour of diligent , non-stop grading & I have finished half a class , ugh . Six more Spanish 2 exams to go ! But , I think I'll take a fifteen minute break now . 
Spanish 2 grades entered ! 
Am I the only one starting to freak out bc I'm not ready AND I haven't gotten the two hour delay notification I was expecting ? 
is a little uncomfortable being on FB after hearing < PROPFIRST>'s poem about being addicted to FB . Hello my name is . . . 
Had a fabulous time with the girls last night ! Can't figure out why I'm awake this early though ? 
I better get my grading on now :) 
Don't forget to snow dance ! 
OMG . Bg is already listed as closed for tomorrow !

Okay , so we're supposed to change our profile pics to ourselves with our significant other & post how long we've been together . I'm divorced , & the best < PROPFIRST>'s Day gifts I ever got were from friends & family the year I was in Spain . So love to all my friends and family ; happy < PROPFIRST>'s Day ! 
has lost her voice :( 
31 days till spring ! 
can't believe she hasn't kicked this flu yet - erg ! 
YOWZERS ! It's one white blur outside . 
So I totally lost control of my car after hitting a patch of ice on the off ramp this morning . Hit the guard rail , ricocheted off , & was finally stopped by a lovely orange barrel . I'm fine ; the school nurse gave me the once over :) No other cars involved , but a bit unsettling nonetheless . Cross your fingers that it's mostly cosmetic damage . 
Bowling Green , Sylvania , & Springfield already closed . 
I can't even SEE the road outside my apartment . Wow . 
I can see the street now . Think I'll venture out shortly . 
got asked for her phone number :) 
is not sleepy :( 
should have been asleep hours ago . G'night . 
Okay , I just woke up from a dream about work , AND I remembered it . This is a sign that spring break is too far away . 
LOOONG day , & tomorrow will be longer . FML :P 
( Reposting something very thoughtful ) < PROPFIRST > Sheen 47 , is all over the news because he's a celebrity drug addict .

Sunshine my long lost friend , I'm so happy to see you this morning ! :) 
\The girl stood at his elbow watching him . \ " \ 
hates spring ahead . I love the sunshine . But , the loss of an hour , & the janking of my schedule . . . ERG ! Plus , as Lorelai Gilmore would say , \hate early . Must kill early . \"" 
Song suggestions to pull one out of the dumps ? 
finally saw & loves -Black Snake Moan- . < PROPFEMALE > Ricci AND < PROPFIRST > L . < PROPMALE > , what more could one ask for ? 
found the ATM card she thought she'd lost ! Whew . 
Happy birthday to my Dad ! 
I would call < PROPFEMALE > & tell her I ran into my ex in town , but she would probably ask , \which one\ " like she did last time . So I'll just laugh & < PROPFEMALE > on obnoxiously with Ash instead :) Maybe it's a sign I NEED to move out of BG . Ha ha ha :D "
