I just got tickets to see a Prairie Home Companion in February in San < PROPMALE > !! 
I really really want to hear form one of the schools I applied to . I am going crazy thinking about it ! 
Feeling a bit sick 
Just started Insanity , feeling a little sore . 
Day 3 of insanity and I am sore all over ! Feeling good about myself , but I am definitely in worse shape than I thought . 
PhD update , got a letter form Washington State that said they are not accepting PhD students this year , not a denial , but I am still very disappointed . This was the school I thought I had the best < PROPMALE > to get into plus I was looking forward to the possibility of living in a small town like Pullman . It would have been nice to know this about 2 months ago so I could have applied to another school 
Denied by both USC and University of Washington today , my two top choices :( 
Around 710 Dayleys live in the US . 
2 out of 4 for the Mtn west , not too bad . Sad for my Rebs . 
Still waiting for Washington St. would love to go to Pullman 
denied by Washington State U N ever L eave V egas :( 
I really really HATE not being good enough ! 
sooooo , if anyone knows of any jobs at a college in maybe enrollment management or student affairs let me know , not that i don't like Vegas or UNLV , but it's time to move on for a while . 
Sooooo , I'm calling for any suggestions on what I should do with my life . Any and all answers accepted . 
Sorry to anyone who got any strange posts from me , it seems someone hacked my account 
Clearly I will go sailing no more 
was feeling like I had a tough life , but after tonight I realize a lot of people would gladly trade places with me . 
Michigan ! 
Seriously , the Detroit airport has to be the worst in the country\ 
The concourse is a mile long\ 
no free internet ( I found a signal to steal)\ 
no AIR CONDITIONING !!! 
Nervously awaiting my fate 
No from Michigan :( looks like I'll be here for a while . 
Had a great 3rd ( 4th ) of July in < PROPFEMALE > with the Judkins . On to Provo and then Payson . 
I am feeling very sick 
I can't remember the last time I felt so sick !! 
< PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > style UNLV shoes now at WALMART only 17 dollars , might have to go buy some 
ahhh New York , sometimes I really miss you . 
does anyone want to donate 600 dollars to fly me to Indiana ? 
My daughter will be going to school on Monday 
I am the most awesome person in the freakin universe . Ask me why . Go ahead . Ask . 
Runnin ' Rebels first look tonight at 7pm at the T&M FREE ! 
It is a serious thing to live in a society of possible gods and goddesses , to remember that the dullest and most uninteresting person you talk to may one day be a creature which , if you saw it now , you would be strongly tempted to worship ... There are no ordinary people . C.S. < PROPFIRST > 
chillin in elko at wendys 
Man I wish I could be at the game tonight !! 
going to the heaven and hell game this weekend , what should I tell those cougars when I get to provo ? 
If anyone feels like going out to a movie where you leave more angry and stressed out than when you came in , and that makes you feel like you just got robbed and beat up in the middle of northtown then I would recommend Skyline . 
I would still rather be a Rebel fan than a b y who fan even if we lost to them 1,000 times in a row . 
I really really wish I didn't have to go to work tomorrow ! 
For everyone who went to < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > Jr. Elementary in Las Vegas , here is part or our school rap :\ 
Black or white or red or green , the color of our skin doesn't mean a thing . All that matters is what's inside , love for each other and lots of pride . The man whose name is on our door fought for freedom for ever more . We will clap and we will sing , we are the champions of < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > ! 
I notice when I'm at work all the ladies like to check out my junk . I really can't say I blame them . 
I wish I was as cool as < PROPFIRST >

I really do not deserve the wife I have . 
I am in Ephriam Utah , it's a bit chilly in Badger Country 
hindsight sucks 
just sat in on a master class with the Juilliard jazz trumpet section and the jazz band director . very interesting . 
if you had to choose between a fresh start in a small town but being kind of poor but a good opportunity for more education , or staying in a big city you've lived in for 30 years with a fancy title and a lot more money but no educational opportunity , what would you choose 
I am so sad that basketball is over . Even though it was an up and down season I love to watch the Rebels play . I have another few weeks to root for our fellow MWC team . Go Aztecs ! S ... D ... S ... U ... S D S U Aztecs Fight ! 
Really enjoyed conference this weekend especially the priesthood session , sorry ladies . 
I love to cry it is just so freeing to let my feelings out . 
Has anyone here ever lived in < PROPFIRST > Utah ? 
I have really tried to stop beating my wife but she will just not learn her place .

Does anyone have some boxes we can have ? 
OK so for everyone who is curious we are moving to < PROPFIRST > Utah in May . I am going to be working at Utah State University . Any and all financial donations will be accepted . 
driving up to < PROPFIRST > for the weekend , where should I eat ?? 
I would like to say thankyou to my friend < PROPFIRST > . He is without a doubt the greatest man I have ever met . He is the wind beneath my wings . 
I ate at < PROPMALE > A Rama today , it wasn't Bellagio or the Carnival World Buffet , but pretty dang good 
Had a great first day at USU RCDE ! I am looking forward to tackling the challenges that lie ahead . I am very glad the we moved to < PROPFIRST > Utah . 
3 nurseries and 2 gospel doctrine classes , welcome to Utah 
When people said that there would be people in shorts and T-Shirts while I was cold and wearing a jacket I though it was just an exageration . Well ... it wasn't 
I need a better title than : Practices for Improving Student Retention for Distance Learners . Something cool and punchy , help me out 
What should I name my new baby boy ? It can't be Finnegan . 
< PROPFEMALE > wants a Christmas Birthday , thanks Chandler Judkins and < PROPFEMALE > Pratt Judkins 
I'm starting to think this PhD thing isn't going to happen ... 
Anyone have an opinion on who I should go with for car insurance ? I am thinking about staying with Allstate , but Progressive is just soooooo Cheap ! What am I missing ? 
Today my wife < PROPFEMALE > Dayley made me a home made Bacon and Brie Pizza and it was awesome ! 
So excited < PROPFIRST > Wood , one of the top B-Ball players for the class of 2013 committed to UNLV . This is just the beginning . 
1Ph j00Z ( 4|\\| r34D 7|-|15 j00Z |-|4 \\/ 3 |\\|0 L1Ph3 but I think you're cool 
Yesterday I celebrated being married for 10 years to < PROPFEMALE > Dayley who is honestly the greatest person living right now . So for everyone out there who thought it wouldn't last ... TAKE THAT HATERS ! 
Looks like it's going to be < PROPFIRST > 
Dayley , it's like a Day , you live it . 
And behold , I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom ; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God . Mosiah 2:17 
And it came to pass that I , Nephi , said unto my father : I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded , for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men , save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them . 1 Nephi 3:7 
Just got a new Spotify account , what are your favorite songs , I need to create some playlisits . 
7lbs 11oz 19 '' < PROPFIRST > 
What I remember most about 9/11 is being scared and confused . I just couldn't fathom anyone being able to attack us the way they did . When I woke up the next day I remember the absolute feeling of unity we all had . I knew at that moment that if we decide to come together , then Americans can do anything . 
Had a great meeting with one of the professors in my prospective PhD program . I am one step closer today . 
Tom : So < PROPMALE > Cordero what's it like in the office without < PROPFIRST > Dayley ? \ 
< PROPMALE > : It's like drinking Orange Juice without the Pulp\
