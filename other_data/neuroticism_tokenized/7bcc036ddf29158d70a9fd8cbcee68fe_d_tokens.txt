I miss my girls already and they only left monday ! Can't wait to go back and visit and pick them up . 

Busy trying to declutter and work on the house while the girls are gone . Much easier ! 9 days til we leave for MN ! Yea ! 
Very upset with my girls . I DO NOT LIKE THEM BEING IN MINNESOTA ! 
Leaving in the morning ! Yea I am so excited ! Can't wait to see my girls and all the people I have missed the past 2 years . I desperately need a break from work too ! So does < PROPMALE > ! He deserves it more than me . Can't wait to see Zac too . We miss him < PROPFEMALE > 
So happy to see all our old friends and neighbors . But especially happy to spend time with Zac . We have missed him soooooo much . 
Went to < PROPFEMALE>'s graduation party that < PROPFEMALE > threw her . I was so happy to see my girls , it's been 20 days since I saw them . Seems alot longer . 
Heading back to NC tomorrow . Got my tattoos , visited friends and family and picking up my girls . Life is great . 
Made it home safe and sound . Glad to see my puppies :-) 
So glad to have my girls home even if they do drive me crazy once in a while . Not so much glad to be here in < PROPFIRST > , NC . I NEED out of here ! I am going crazy ... 
Dreading work with a passion ... again . That place sucks . I know I should be happy to have a job but that place is messed up bigtime . Very depressing :-( 
Taking < PROPFEMALE > out for her belated birthday dinner then shopping . Can't believe she is 19 :-( 
Taking the girls to the Dr. in the morning . < PROPFEMALE > has been 2 times already , now Haily has it too . < PROPMALE > and I are just starting to show signs . Drs . here suck . First one told < PROPFEMALE > \you could have swine flu as far as I know\ " Gotta love McDowell county . " 
Well the girls seem to be doing better hopefully its the medicine working . Hate to see my babies miserable :-( Off to shower and get ready for work . 
Well now < PROPMALE > and I are getting sick :-( Hopefully it won't get as bad or last as long as the girls . 
Getting ready to go to work . Feel like crap again today :( Maybe it was too much tax free shopping in Hickory . Maybe its just the thought of going to work . 
It amazes me that people can go on with their lives and just forget . Forget the people whose lives they have ruined , the pain they have caused , the children they have disappointed who meant so much to them . Broken promises , lies , and the lack of character to do the right thing . Stand up for yourself . You only get one life ... do the right thing . 
What does a nervous breakdown feel like ? Anybody know ? 
So glad to be reconnecting with old friends . Its been too long . 
Heading to the beach and to a wedding this weekend . Can't wait ! Only 2 more days of work , then 6 off . Yea ! Geoff will probably have to drag me back here kicking and screaming . I hate this town :-( 
Beautiful day at the beach ! Back there tomorrow after the wedding . Swam tonight in the pool with my girls . Life is great ! ( sunburn sucks ) 
Back from the beach ... and burnt . Oh well still 2 more days off from work . The weather was perfect . Can't wait to go back . 
I can't believe my baby is a senior now . It brakes my heart to see how fast they grow up . 
I have officially been smoke free for 5 1/2 years . Haven't even cheated once ! Yea me ! 
Sad that I have to turn down an amazing job at Grace Hospital cuz I can't afford the insurance , prescriptions and co-pays :-( 
Going to enjoy my day off with < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > . < PROPMALE > is still deathly sick and Haily went to Carrowinds . ( brat ! ) 
Getting ready to bake a cake for < PROPMALE>'s birthday today . Gonna have a cooktout with Grandma and kids tonight . 
Trying to figure out a home for a very cute puppy that < PROPFEMALE > drug home last night . 
Hoping to find a home for this puppy soon before I fall in love with him . Both of our dogs are very jealous and HATE him . All he wants to do is play ... he is so cute ! 
Just found out the puppy < PROPFEMALE > brought home has parvo :-( So ... now we get to fork out between $400-$700 to save his life ... hopefully . Theres an 80% < PROPMALE > of recovery . 
Waiting to hear from the vet to make sure Ceasar is doing ok . He is such a sweet puppy , you can't help but love him . I hope we can find him a good home after we get him healthy . 
Just talked to the vet and she said Ceasar is doing great and we can pick him up anytime . We are gonna pick him up at 2:00 . Yea ! 
Ceasar is home and doing great ... plus the vet < PROPMALE > was $300.00 less than we expected . He is so sweet . 
Very disappointed in my youngest . Hoping my fever is gone and my throat feels better before I go to work . 
Spent the day sick in bed ! Thought I was over this crap but NOT . I feel miserable :-( 
Still feeling pretty bad , but have to go in to work at 5:00 . Work called me at 7:42 this AM and wanted me to work this morning . I am like NO I can hardly even get out of bed . Work sucks . It makes me think of those pirate shirts that say \ The beatings will continue until moral improves \"" 
Gotta get ready for work ... then 6 days off ! Yea ! Hoping to be very productive on my days off . The more I get done the closer we are to getting out of here . I hear the ocean calling me . 
Well I survived the big \40\ " I guess it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be . I still feel about 25 . " 
Please boycott Toyota ! They claim to be green but are huge contributors to anti-environmental groups . BOO TOYOTA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Who would have thought that work could get any worse than it already was ! Now its about 100 times worse ! UGH ! 
UGH ! 
Off to work again on this fine Sunday morning ! Praying that < PROPMALE > gets a different job far away from here so we can move ... before I go insane ;-) 
Actually had a decent day at work ... and worked my butt off . Not to many chiefs there today ! Makes life easier . 
Wishing < PROPFEMALE > would actually use that brain she has . So tired of the < PROPFIRST > bullcrap ! 
Taking my baby girl to get her nails done and out to lunch :-) Just a girls day celebration ! 
Had a great day with Haily ! I Am so proud of my baby ! Love you lots Tweet ! 
I have a disgusting cough and my throat is raw . What a nice way to spend my day off :-( 
Feeling much better today . It's amazing what some old antibiotics I found will do . Much easier than actually going to the Dr. Which in McDowell county is a a lot scarier than taking old antibiotics . 
< PROPFEMALE > ( our 12 year old dog ) is not doing very good ... I am gonna bring her in to the vet in the morning . It doesn't look good . Please say a prayer for my puppy . We love her soooo much , she is our baby . :-( 
< PROPFEMALE > is doing ok . She is on antibiotics and some more liver meds . So happy we got to bring her home . We were preparing for the worst . Thank god she hopefully will be ok . 
' The will of God will never take you where the Grace of God will not protect you . ' 
Some people refuse to see the truth ... even as it is stabbing them in the back . 
Taking < PROPFIRST > ( nephew/son lol ) out for supper tonight and shopping . ( his last family supper ) He leaves monday for basic training for the air force . :-( 
Off to work today . I just hope that I don't have to deal with the old bitty today . Makes it a much nicer day . If I am ever that old and bitter I hope Geoff just shoots me . She is one miserable old bat . 
Well < PROPMALE > ( nephew/son ) oficially starts basic training for the air force today . We miss him already ... no one to pick on . ( jk ) We love him and miss him lots . He has lived with us for almost 4 years , the house seems kind of empty without him :-( 
Yea ! We got about a foot of snow today ! Feels like home :-) 
Its official we got 15\ of snow here . Whoo hoo ! " 
I hope everyone has a very < PROPFEMALE > Christmas and a safe holiday season . I am hoping < PROPFEMALE > will bring me what I want more than anything . One of my facebook friends knows exactly what that is . To everyone else shhhhhhhhh ! Its a secret . 
Still waiting for my e-mail ... < PROPFEMALE > X-mas everyone ! 
I am officially off work until the 21st of < PROPFIRST > . now if I had somewhere to escape to , hint hint :-) 
So excited to be heading to < PROPMALE > , leaving either later today or in the AM . We have a showing @ 9:15 in the morning . Gonna do some work on the house and unpacking , then later this week ... a night all to myself !!!!!! (except for dogs ) Gonna do some shopping , bumming around and enjoy a whole lot of rare ME time . 
Thank you :-) 
Leaving about 4:00 this morning for the outer banks . < PROPMALE > has a job interview for a job on Roanoke Island , in Manteo . We are spending the night at Kill Devil Hills in a room overlooking the ocean . Too Bad the weather is sucky . Oh well it will still be nice to get away . 
We spent the day driving around the Outer Banks sightseeing , walking on the beach and freezing our butts off . Spending the night in a room on the beach in Kill Devil Hills . Tomorrow we are going to check out Roanoke Island and Manteo . Saw the house from \Nights in Rodanthe\ " even thought it is partially in the ocean now and condemned along with 22 other 1-2 million dollar(at least ) homes along that stretch of beach . " 
Well we made it home last night . Wish we could have stayed there forever . < PROPMALE > and I watched about 40-50 dolphins playing , for about an hour , right from our balcony . It would be nice if he gets that job out there . I would be in heaven :-) 
Missing my < PROPFIRST > , we\ve only heard from him once since he left for basic on 12/15 . :-( " 
Praying for the people of Haiti . What a horrible tragedy . Please help in any way you can . Even if it's only a little . It all adds up and they so desperately need all the help they can get . :-( 
I wanna kick his butt for breakin my baby's heart !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Well < PROPMALE > got a call on friday ... they offered him a job with the State of NC < PROPFEMALE > in Raleigh . So I guess we are moving ! Yea ! I will be sad to leave all the wonderful people I know here . But the girls and I will be here til June when Haily graduates . < PROPMALE > starts next month after we get back from Texas . 
Wouldn't you know it ... I got a phone call today about a job at the Asheville airport ( TSA ) now that we are gonna move . I first applied for this job almost 2 years ago . I haven't heard from them in 1 1/2 years . 
Off to work I go . Is there any more exciting way to spend your friday night ? I think not ! 
Trying to dig up a bunch of old photos . Should be interesting what I come up with . 
Only had time to post a few photos . I am off to work from 9pm to 6 AM . Yea ! 
Going to sleep so I can go in and work 3rd again tonight ! Yea ! At least we had fun doing it . I worked with the best ladies last night . Even though some weren't acting like a lady ... < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Just found out that my supervisor denied my time off request because someone else has vacation ... so it doesn't look like I will be going to Texas for Matts graduation :-( 
My < PROPMALE > is stuck in Asheville tonight cuz of the damn snow :-( 
Had a horrible day at work today ! Tomorrow HAS to be better :-)

More snow and freezing rain/ice . Geoffreys got the truck today so its not looking good as far as me making it to work at 5:00 . We'll see . I feel like I am back in MN ... but at least there they plowed the roads . Haily only had school for part of the day yesterday . School has been closed the rest of the week . Thats more snow days than she had in 10 years back in MN . lol 
Anybody been out and about < PROPFIRST > ? How are the roads ? 
T.J. Kirkpatrick is a fricken LOSER . He broke my baby's heart AGAIN ! I can't tell if his TJ stands for < PROPMALE > Jr. or < PROPFIRST > Jr. although he is a bigger loser than both put together . That boy needs mental help .

Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn’t do than by the ones you did do . So throw off the bowlines . Sail away from the safe harbor . Catch the trade winds in your sails . Explore . Dream . Discover . - < PROPFIRST > Twain - 
Thought of you with love today , but that is nothing new . I thought about you yesterday , and days before that too . I think of you in silence , I often speak your name . All I have are memories and a picture in a frame . Your memory is a keepsake , with which I'll never part . God has you in His keeping , I have you in my heart . Repost if you have a loved one in Heaven 
If you're not ready to have your heart broken you're not ready to be a parent .

Lets support our firefighters . If you support our firefighters then please post this on your status and leave it there for one hour . There should be no excuses from anyone !!

Gonna try to start watching what I eat and exercising . Need to lose ALOT of weight and < PROPFEMALE > ... you are making me extremely jealous ! You don't even have any to lose :-p I hope to be down at LEAST 20 lbs by june 1st . The rest will take several more months :-( 
Getting ready to move sucks ! 
What a beautiful day ! 84 degrees and not a cloud in the sky . I should be outside tanning but < PROPMALE > ( worlds greatest , tattoo artist ) would probably kick my butt ! Sunscreen sunscreen sunscreen ! lol 
Not a good day ... its been 25 years ago today since I lost my mom :-( Now I have my daughter treating me like shit . If people only realized how short life really is . They wouldn't be so selfish and would treat people better ... before its too late . 
When I said mondays sucked i didn't know today would be a really bad monday . My baby Gypsy ( 7 year old cocker spaniel ) suffered a stroke today . She is doing alright , at the vet overnight , she has some facial paralysis but her legs are pretty good . Hopefully she will be a little better tomorrow . She is my baby and does not leave my side ... I love her so much . :-( 
Talked to the vet this morning , Gypsy is doing good I get to pick her up at 10:30 . Then Haily and I will be on our way to < PROPMALE > for a few days to visit < PROPMALE > . It will be my first time driving in the big city so wish me luck ., and pray that I don't have too many panic attacks . Thank god for anxiety pills !!! 
i love < PROPMALE > 
Well we just got back from < PROPMALE > about an hour ago . We had a great time . < PROPMALE > showed us around and we did some shopping . I did great driving . It didn't even bother me at all .

wonders if it's all kids or just mine that are capable of sucking the life force out of you with no remorse ?!!! I give up ...

I messed up my arm last night at work carrying a ladder . It kept me awake most of the night , it was extremely painful :-( I found some of my muscle relaxers from my neck and took a couple of them . It's feeling better so far today . 
If you could look like anyone in the world who would you pick and why ? 
should be getting stuff done but here i am playing on this damn facebook• . ¸¸ . •´¯`• .?. •´¯`• . ¸¸ . • . • . ¸¸ . •´¯`• .?. •´¯`• . ¸¸ . • . 
The word ' sad ' doesn't even come close ... 
Its official ... I am gonna be a grandma . 
Well , off to work on my day off ... really need the extra money now . 
My arm is killing me !!!!!!!!!!!! I might have to break down and go to the Dr. on thursday . But I have to have a member of management escort me and watch me pee in a cup . ( well not exactly but close ) What a bunch of B.S. 
Wall Street is spending $500 million to convince Congress to kill the reform < PROPMALE > that will curb their reckless behavior . That's one investment that's paying off . Every single Republican is on record opposing Wall Street reform . That means every single Republican is on record protecting big banks instead of the Americans who lost jobs , money , houses , or their pensions because of Wall Street's behavior . 
Please put this on your status if you know someone who suffers from Rectal Cranial Inversion . Rectal Cranial Inversion , otherwise known as Head Up Your Ass Syndrome , affects the lives of many . There is still no known cure for Rectal Cranial Inversion , but we can raise awareness . 93% won't copy and paste this , mainly because they already suffer from RCI !!! 
OK , just for the record the girl in the redhot thong video or whatever is a virus or something ! Do NOT open it . I did NOT post it on anybody's < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Missing my < PROPMALE > alot tonight . Get to see him tomorrow though , and I have the whole weekend off ! Yea !

It was a sad day today one of < PROPMALE>'s fellow firefighters and his wife lost their home , all of their belongings and their dog to a fire today . 
Getting ready for work then I get to drive and meet < PROPMALE > in Statesville probably and pick up my boy !!!! < PROPMALE > is coming home today !!!! He didn't find out til yesterday afternoon and he has to fly to Japan next wednesday when he leaves here :-( Probably for 1-2 years :-(

Happy Mothers day to all , I hope everyone had a great day . Spent mine at work , other than that it was pretty great . 
Getting ready to go to work on my day off . Trying to pick up some extra hours cuz I need the money . Friday is Haily's 18th b-day , saturday is a 1 year anniversary off a < PROPMALE > milestone for her and graduation is right around the corner . Ugh ! I need to buy a lottery ticket . 
Off to work :( But I have the next 2 days off to spend with my wonderful family :D 
Haily fell off the back of a scooter last night when some idiot friend of hers took a corner too fast . Thank God she wasn't seriously hurt . She got some road rash , a broken finger and a couple big bruises . I have never been so scared in my life , as I was when she called me crying to come get her . It could have been so much worse ... I don't even like to think about it . 
might not be that beautiful or the \ 
sexiest ... nor have the perfect body ... I might not be anyones first \ 
choice ... but I am a GREAT choice ... I don't pretend to be someone \ 
else ... cause I am too good at being ME ... I might not be proud of some \ 
of the things I've done ... but I am proud of who I am today . Take me as I\

Geoff is putting down new flooring in the kitchen , whoo hoo ! One step closer to getting out of here ! YEA ! 
< PROPFEMALE > Palin , comedy genius ( unintended ) is now accusing\ 
President Obama of being in bed with big oil . Isn't that kinda like \ 
having < PROPFIRST > Manson call you crazy ? 
Well ... I thought I was gonna have an easy week , only 12 1/2 hours of work . But now it looks like it will be more like 37 hours or so . Oh well I need the money and of course I LOVE my job . ( jk ) 
Night ! Gotta get up early for work . Sweet dreams . 
Well , I hurt my arm at work a while back , they send me to their doctor , and the guy from work comp calls today and says they arn't paying for anything cuz it just kind of happened , it wasn't an \accident\ " !!!!!!!!! What a fricking joke . I did < PROPFEMALE > up on him though so that made me feel better . UGH !!!!!!!!!!!!! " 
what a f'd up night . Just had to go pick up Haily cuz some drunk asshole was trying to bring her home and luckily he had to pull over and puke . 2nd time in 10 days some drunk has put her life in jeopardy . She needs new friends ! Next time she may not be that lucky . Hopefully there isn't a next time . 
Getting ready to go to my mostest favoritest place in the world ! < PROPMALE > world ! I bet you wish you were me !!!!!!!!! Na na na boo boo ! I am so lucky :-P

Missing my boy < PROPFIRST > today :-( 
Trying to find a cheap plane ticket to fly my dad down for graduation . Ugh ! Tthey arn't very cheap . Oh well I give up for tonight , I am beat . I worked way too hard this week . 
Had an amazing porterhouse on the grill tonight , and I didn't even have to grill it ! Back to work tomorrow , and < PROPMALE > goes back to < PROPMALE > tomorrow night . This is getting old fast . My dad is coming on the 8th and staying with < PROPMALE > til the 11th when they come back here . Not sure how long he is staying . I soooooo want to ride back with him ! I NEED to see < PROPMALE > . I am going into withdrawl !!!!!!!!!!! 
Getting ready for bed , I have to be to work at 5 am !!!!!! Thanks < PROPFEMALE > :-P Off at 2 though so that is one good thing . Bills to pay and tattoos to get :-) 
It's 3:51 am and I am ready for work ... there is something seriously wrong with this picture . Definately gonna have to come home and take a nice long nap :-) 
Nap time :-) 
Off to work , then hoping to get something done around here . We need to get this house on the market !! Ugh ! Not looking forward to showings , especially trying to hide 3 psychotic dogs . Anyone want a dog ??? 
Just talked to my dad , he is on his way to the hospital . He is having trouble with his motor skills , he almost fell a couple times . He thinks it could possibly be lymes disease :-( I guess that would probably be better than the alternative , such as stroke or something . By the way , he is driving himself ! UGH !!!!!!! I may have to go to MN after all . 
Nap or paint ? Hmmm ... thats a tough one ! 
My dad said he is fine , he said his heart rate was like 46 when he went in . They are gonna keep him over night and do an ultra sound in the morning . < PROPFEMALE > his # is 218 246 2399 room # 509 . 
Talked to my dad tonight , he had failed to mention to me earlier that his blood sugar was in the 300's . They gave him a shot of insulin and started him on coumadin(blood thinner ) I think there is a lot more going on than he wants to tell me . I guess I shouldn't be suprised . Thats the way he is ... unfortunately . 
They are taking my dad by ambulance to Duluth . He has high levels of enzymes in his blood . Not sure why . hopefully I will know more soon . 
Well ... I am pretty sure my dad had a heart attack ! I will know more once they transfer him to Duluth .

So ... my baby graduates tomorrow night . Then she is leaving for MN on Monday ( actually they both are but < PROPFEMALE > is coming back in 3 weeks ) don't know for sure if/when Haily is coming back . It will be a very tough few days for me . I will probably be a blubbering idiot :-( 
Getting ready for graduation . I can't believe she is 18 already . Where did the time go ? (?_?) 
Please God < PROPMALE > me the < PROPFEMALE > to put up with my dad for the next 2 weeks or so , and could you please give me lots of hours at work . lol 
My girls are leaving for Minnesota tomorrow ... I am gonna miss them so much . I am gonna miss < PROPMALE > , MyLea and < PROPFEMALE > too . It has been really nice having them here . It's gonna be a very sad day for me :( 
:( </3 
Long day at work , wouldn't have been so bad but I have been feeling like crap since last wednesday today being the worst . I can barely talk . And the highlight of my lunch hour was coming home to say good bye to my girls . I miss them already ... 
Still feeling pretty crappy today so I am gonna break down and go to the Dr. , I probably have strep . I have been putting it off for a week now ... guess its time to go in :( It would be nice if I could talk again . 
Just got back from the Dr. a little while ago , what a waste of time ! That's why I hate going . Its a \virus\ " so take some advil and cough syrup . Gee what do you think I have been doing for the past 7 days . Ugh ! " 
Missing my girls , but at least I know they made it safe . Hope they enjoy their visit and are ready to come home soon . 
Come on Celtics pull your heads out and kick Kobe's butt ! 
Just talked to Matt ... he is deploying to Afganistan in December :-( 
Love you < PROPFIRST > !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Praying that < PROPMALE > will get a leave and get to come home before he deploys to Afghanistan in December . (?_?) 
Hope all my friends that are fathers , have a wonderful fathers day :-D 
95 degrees and < PROPFEMALE > . Beautiful day in NC . Missing my girls . 
I love my dogs dearly ... but man they are expensive . $200 for 3 months of < PROPFEMALE>'s liver medicine not including her insulin and needles , plus dog food . Luckily the other 2 are pretty healthy . ( now after sinking about $1000 on them ) Ugh ! 
Wishing my girls were missing me as much as I am missing them :( 
Going to get my hair cut at 2:30 then gonna work on Haily's bathroom some more . Hoping to have it all done by sunday .

Got some painting done today . Not much more to go . ( LOL < PROPFIRST > ) 
Got to ride in the firetruck with < PROPMALE > for the < PROPFIRST > parade tonight , it was fun making all the little kids smile . The parade was pretty lame though . I saw you Brooke :-)

Getting some stuff done around the house , then heading to < PROPMALE > til thursday . So excited to look at houses . 
The house we were interested in ... somebody signed a contract for yesterday , so back to square one . It sucks cuz that would have been the perfect house , 3864sq feet , on 2 acres ! Would have had room for everyone ( the painting might have taken me a while though lol ) Gonna check out some other areas tonight . My < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > comes home today :) but I won't get to see her til tomorrow when I go home . Friday she turns 20 ! 
I absolutely LOVE < PROPMALE > ! There is so much stuff here . Can't wait to be here for good . I also love my GPS , cuz if it weren't for it , I would probably hate < PROPMALE > :-) 
104 Degrees here in < PROPMALE > today . Gotta love the heat :-) 
Stopping by the < PROPFEMALE > on my way home to have lunch with < PROPMALE > , they are having a cookout , bbq pork yum !!!!! Then home to see my baby < PROPFEMALE > and my dogs . Can't wait , I missed < PROPFEMALE > so much . Can't wait til my Haily < PROPFEMALE > comes home too . She has her tattoo consult with < PROPMALE > today , excited about that too . Wish I could be there when she gets it done . I am so jealous !! 
I had an amazing time at < PROPMALE>'s »-(¯'v'¯)-» < PROPMALE > wasn't too bad either . Did NOT want to come back to < PROPFIRST > . Too much to see and do there . Plus I miss < PROPMALE > ... 
Why does this place make me so depressed ? Ugh , i do not wanna be here . ( work ) 
< PROPFEMALE > has her ultrasound at 2:00 today . I am so excited ! I hope they can tell the sex of the baby , so I can start buying gender specific stuff instead of some of each lol . I think I have enough baby clothes to last til this baby is 4 :-) OCD !!!!!!!!!!! 
Its a boy ! 
Got to see my future grandson today yeah ! It was pretty exciting . Can't wait to meet him in person . Now if they can just agree on a boys name ! 
< PROPFEMALE > and I went through baby clothes I have bought ... and I am pretty sure he won't need any clothes for at least the first year . ( or 2 or 3 ) If she would be having a girl she would be set for a couple years too . What can I say they are so cute :) 
A\ 
son will outgrow your lap but never your heart !!! It's \Son's Week\ " If you\ 
What a HORRIBLE night ! I took < PROPFEMALE > to < PROPFIRST>'s ( 1 1/2 hours away ) and got out to help her get her stuff and the truck locked its self ! Well we called the locksmith and he wanted$160 , so instead we spent the next 4 fricking hours trying to get in it , then his dad found a guy for $45 after wasting all that time . The whole drive home I just wanted to cry ... 
Feeling very emotional today , just want to crawl back in bed and cry ... 
My girl's step-mom is in the hospital back in MN with a VERY bad stomach infection she needs all the prayers she can get . She is a wonderful person and she has done so much for my girls . Please keep her in your thoughts and prayers for a speedy recovery . 
Missing my family bunches . Very lonely :(

5:00 am sucks , especially since I couldn't fall asleep until about 1:30 . Too much on my mind . Gonna be dragging butt today . 
Praying for < PROPFEMALE > ( the girl's step mom ) , she has to have surgery today at 3:00 and have part of her fallopian tube removed because of a bad infection . They are hoping that takes care of a couple other problems she has been having too over the past few months . 
Had a pretty good day at work today , I even volunteered to be back at 7 in the morning . 5:00 am is gonna come pretty quick again . So tired , I am lucky if I can make it til 10:00 tonight . 
Next time I think about getting my hair cut ... somebody slap me . I miss the length a lot , good thing it grows fast . Now ... I am thinking about dyeing it , not sure if I should go light or dark . Any suggestions ? I need opinions please ;-) 
Had an amazing nap :) Still needing more opinions on light or dark for my hair !!! I am so confused ;) I get to sleep in tomorrow ! Yea ! Don't work til 1:00 . The dogs had me up at 4:25 am , I could barely keep my eyes open by the time I got home . Think I had slept about 8 or 9 hours the past 2 days . Too much stuff on my mind . I wish it had a shut off switch . 
Just got a phone call from work asking if I wanted the day off cuz they had to cut payroll . Hell yes ! ( even though that defeats the purpose of me working yesterday ) Oh well I am happy :))))) 
I am enjoying my unexpected day off :) Heading to < PROPMALE > on Sunday after work , staying til Thursday . Gonna look at houses . I am hoping to hit the pool while I am there , when < PROPMALE > is at work . ( If I am not too chicken to go by myself . ) 
my friend < PROPFEMALE > lost her son in a car accident last night . Please keep her and her family in your thoughts and prayers . 
a very sad day today ... 
My heart is breaking for my friend < PROPFEMALE > who lost her son ( 21 ) last night in a car accident . I can't imagine the pain she is going through right now and his brother and sister . I have so many memories of him as a cute little guy flirting with my girls . R.I.P. < PROPMALE > you are loved by so many . 
Always tell the people you love how much you do , because in the blink of an eye , they could be gone , and you never want them to have to wonder if anyone cared . 
Getting ready to head to < PROPMALE > in a few minutes , gonna stay til Thursday . Hoping we get something figured out soon . Sometimes I just wanna run away . 
Gonna get ready and go bum around < PROPMALE > , maybe find some baby stuff . NOT chothes though . Now she's gonna need stuff lol . The clothes were the cheap part now comes the spendy stuff . 
didn't find anything for < PROPFEMALE > or the baby but I did find me a bra and a cute little sundress :)

Heading back to < PROPFIRST > after I stop to see < PROPMALE > . I hate the drive ugh ! Long and boring , plus I like it here way better . Lots of shopping :) 
says hearts and minds are like parachutes ... they only work when they're open . 
< PROPMALE > left a while ago to head back to Raleigh ... another week stuck here in < PROPFIRST > alone :( Its been 5 months of this ... ugh ! I may have to go back to Minnesota to pick up my baby . Scared to drive that far by myself though , although I may not have a choice .

Just talked to < PROPMALE > a while ago ... one of his friends and co-workers was killed on Friday after he wiped out on his motorcycle a went to get it out of the road and a truck hit him . This just hasn't been a good couple weeks , for anyone :(((( 
Working 2-11 again , talk about a sucky shift ! I liked my 7-4's even though I am not much of a morning person . 
Heading to Morganton to go out to eat then ... we are gonna go check out their wal-mart . I am not sure I can handle all that excitement in one day . lol 
Working 3rd tonight and tomorrow , what was I thinking ??????? < PROPMALE > just left for the week , again ! Should find out Tuesday if I have to drive back to Minnesota and get Haily . 
Decided to drive Geoff's tahoe to work , when I went to leave at 7 it was dead . We got it started 2 times but it wouldn't stay running ... so it might be stuck there til the weekend when Geoff gets home ugh !!! I need sleep . 
getting ready to nap , so I can go work 3rd again . Maybe tomorrow I will figure out a way to get the tahoe home :( 
So very tired . I think I am gonna have to dope up the dog , cuz every time he hears a noise he barks and wakes me up . I need sleep desperately . I worked from 10 last night til 8:10 this morning . Goodnight , sure hope I have sweet dreams :-D 
Well I did get some sleep today . Didn't get much else accomplished unfortunately . Back to my 2pm to 11pm tomorrow and Friday , not sure which shift is worse . Still waiting to find out if my dad is bringing Haily home or if I have to go get her , he is such a pain in the A$$ . Still not sure if I could actually drive that far by myself :( 
Pretty crappy day :( Only good thing is my baby is coming home next week :) If my dad pulls his head out of his butt !!! 
Getting ready to go work 3rd , again ... Why am I such a sucker ?????? 
sitting here at work wondering why ? < PROPFEMALE > , next time i will run from you ! Lol \\n 
I can tell it's not gonna be a good day already :( 
I HATE STUPID PSYCHOTIC EX-WIVES THAT BRAINWASH THEIR CHILDREN !! 
Working 2-11 in jewelry , feeling pretty crappy :( 
Had a pretty crappy night at work , but 2 different guys called me a girl , so that made it all better . Its been a long time since somebody called me a girl , I didn't feel quite so old considering I am almost a grandma :( 
Goodnight , I hope tonight is much better than last night :( 
Enjoying my day off , slept til noon and feel much better today . Just been REALLY depressed lately . Too much bad stuff happening :( 
I don't have to go back to work til Friday . Yeah ! Heading to < PROPMALE > tomorrow . Not sure what I plan to accomplish there , cuz house hunting kind of sucks , but at least I won't be working :) 
Getting ready to head out to < PROPMALE > . I hate that drive so much ! It seems like it takes forever . If I can barely handle 3 1/2 hours of driving I sure hope I don't have to go to Minnesota and get Haily , for me probably a 24 hour drive . ( if Geoff drives probably 15 jk ! more like 19 . I need to stop and sleep :) 
Here in < PROPMALE > trying to figure out what to do ... hmmm .... I know ! Go shopping :) Think I will check out ... never mind ;) 
Getting ready to go bum around < PROPMALE > and entertain myself . Looked at a house last night that was \almost\ " perfect :( Can't wait til we find the perfect one ! " 
Made it home form < PROPMALE > , now off to work at 5:00 . Haily and Grampa are on their way to NC . Finally , my baby is coming home :-) 
so happy my baby made it home safe . She would have made it sooner but Grampa drove like the old geezer that he is . Lol 
what a long night at work ! Feet are killing me . I would kill for a good foot massage . 
Working 2:30 - 11:30 today . What a crappy fricken shift ! 
Havin one of those days ... feel like crap , the dog is puking and withering away :-( On my way to work , I wish I could just crawl in bed and make it all go away . 
Came home from work early , felt like crap . Ended up taking < PROPFEMALE > ( our dog ) to the vet . She is not doing good at all . She is severely dehydrated , won't eat so she can't get her insulin and her liver is not working very well :-( . Will know more in the morning . 
Talked to the vet's office , they said < PROPFEMALE > is doing better , she actually ate this morning . Her blood sugar was through the roof and her liver wasn't functioning . The Dr. is gonna call later to update me . I hate to see her suffer . How much is enough ? This is tough :-( The vet said most < PROPMALE > short-hairs don't make it to her age ( 12 ) 
Off to work , having a garage sale ( one good thing about going to work ! I don't have to be here for that ) and ... may have to make a decision about < PROPFEMALE > today :-( I keep making myself sick over this . 
< PROPFEMALE > got to come home tonight :-) She is doing better , not sure how long she will be with with us but we will enjoy all the time we do have with her . 
Off work for a whole week , and heading to < PROPMALE > tomorrow . Did ok at the garage sale but still have A LOT of stuff left . < PROPFEMALE > is still sitting out at the sale just for something to do . Pissed at Haily ... again :-( 
Getting ready to pack up all the garage sale stuff , most of it will get donated . I just want it gone ! Can't believe we had sooooooo much stuff ! Never again ! Thank God for my < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > ! She did an amazing job on the sale :-) 
on my way back to < PROPMALE > with < PROPMALE > , traffic is horrible . Glad i didnt drive , too many idiots on the road . No work til next sunday :-) 
So excited ! Tomorrow is Geoff's birthday and we are both going to get 90 minute massages today . ( he doesn't know yet ) I can't wait , it will be heavenly :-) 
i extremely enjoyed the 90 minutes of a complete stranger massaging lotion all over my body . It was heavenly :-) 
Gonna take < PROPMALE > out for his birthday dinner tonight , then who knows ????? Told him it was his birthday and we could do anything he wanted ;-) 
Getting my stuff packed up to head back to < PROPFIRST > this evening . Real estate agent really pissed me off , he was on vacation , but said he had backup to show us some houses while he was gone ... well he couldn't come up with anyone ! Ugh . Guess we will be looking for a new agent . Thinking I might have to take my leave of absence from work soon so we can actually get stuff acomplished . This sucks bigtime ! 
Heading back to < PROPMALE > in a while with Haily ... and my dad . Gonna look at a couple houses and come back Thursday . Should be quite stressful bringing my dad ... ugh . 
Made it to < PROPMALE > without too much stress , except that my battery died 3 times and I had to get jumped , til we could get to the store and bought a new one .. Appointments to look at 2 houses tomorrow . No extra bedrooms though so I guess grampa will have to stay with < PROPFIRST > or < PROPFEMALE > in MN ... :-) 
You and I wake up in jail together . Using only 4 words , what would you say \ 
to me ? If you comment you must copy and paste this as your status . This \ 
should be interesting ... 
Well I believe we may have found our house as long as nobody else nabs it before we get our shit together . And yes my dear brother-in law I will be very busy painting ... but when I am done I am coming to NYC to visit you :-) Maybe I better not wait til I am done ... that could take a while :-) 
Heading back to Marion(ugh ) in a while . Gonna stop in < PROPFIRST > at \once upon a child\ " on the way home and look for baby stuff :-) " 
I think it says sucker across my forehead cuz I am working 3rd again tonight . 
Well ... my dad left here this morning to head back to MN and made it about 3 1/2 hours . He called a while ago and he is in the hospital . They are shipping him to the VA in Lexington , KY . His blood sugar was high and his pulse very low , they are talking about a pacemaker . May have to head to KY to pick him up to make sure he is OK before he tries to head home again . 
Well my dad made it to the VA in Lexington , but it was late and they wouldn't let me talk to him . I will know more in the morning . The nurse did say he was doing ok though . 
Well I talked to my dad this morning and they were gonna release him at 10:00 or so . No pacemaker , they took him off 2 of his bp drugs , said that was making his heart rate so low and the other symptoms were from his blood sugar being sky high . 
So excited ! < PROPMALE > , our tattoo artist , just sent us a package in the mail with 5 shirts and a bunch of different stickers ! You are the best ! We love you :-) 
Well we put in an offer for a house yesterday . It is bank owned and we low balled them but hopefully they come back with a decent counter offer . Only thing that sucks is that we will have 2 house loans til we sell ours . Ugh ! Just want out of here ! I need to be in a town that has more than just a wal mart ! I want traffic and lots of people and lots of stores and CHOICES ! lol

Time to get ready for work . Stuck there till 11:30 tonight . Then heading to < PROPMALE > in the morning cuz I am off Tues . -Thurs . Hoping we hear something on the house today . 
Well , we found out that the house we made an offer on went to auction , so now its a bidding war :-( Anyone interested in our house spread the word 3 bdrm , 3 bath 3 fp on 3.3 acres beautiful lot- approx 1900 sq ft with full unfinished basement 1 car garage and 2 car carport . $ 160,000 or b/o . We need out of here fast . 
Sitting here in < PROPMALE > wondering what to do today . I know ... maybe I will go shopping :) 
Getting ready to pack up my shit and head back to < PROPFIRST > . Hoping and praying that everything works out with that house . For some reason I have a feeling it won't :( I really don't want to start looking all over again . I want THAT house . I guess if it's meant to be we will get it if not I will just cry alot . lol 
Made it back from < PROPMALE > . Now back to work in the morning . Hoping and praying we can sell this house and that we get the other one . I wanted to be out of here by the time this baby comes , but its not looking like that is gonna happen :( 
Getting ready for work . I was supposed to have the weekend off , but someone is out sick ... so I volunteered to work today and tomorrow evening . I wish I didn't need the money :( I would so love to be sleeping right now . 
I am definitely a woos now , its been in the 50's at night and in the mornings and I am so wanting to to crank up the heat and dig out the warm clothes . Brrrrrr , how did I ever survive growing up in Minnesota ? And working outside when it was -10 ? 
Well the bank accepted our offer for the house ! It was $ 38,000 less than the asking price ! So excited :) Hopefully we will be moving the beginning of Dec . 
So excited about the house ! I can't wait to move ! I will miss all of my wonderful friends and co-workers though :( I work with some pretty amazing people :-D

Ahhhh ! An amazing jacuzzi bath by candle light :) 
Work at 7:00 then off for the weekend . Gonna relax and enjoy :) 
Just want to thank everyone for the birthday wishes . I had a great birthday with the family . 
So very tired ... haven't been sleeping well lately :( Must be old age now that I am over the hill lol . 
I try my best to be a nice person ... but sometimes at work , it is soooooooo very hard . Some people are just plain rude no matter what you do or say . It's sad that people must be so miserable in their own lives to be able to treat others like that . 
I am so gonna enjoy my day off today , by doing absolutely nothing . Well maybe a little shopping wouldn't hurt :) 
It's couples week copy and paste the date you started dating ...... March 15th , 1997

Getting ready to head to < PROPMALE > in a bit . Don't have to work til Friday ! YEA ! Definitely need a break form there . Gonna do some job research while I am over there and see what I come up with . The weather is really crappy , hope it doesn't get too bad for my drive . 
made it to < PROPMALE > . Very sad news though , my daughters Grampa died . He was a super sweet guy and he will be missed dearly . 
I have no internet service at < PROPMALE>'s apt so I am sitting in my vehicle down by the club house using their internet . Sucks bigtime but I guess its better than nothing . 
had a very good day in < PROPMALE > :-) 
Trying to figure out what I am gonna do today . Probably just bum around and look for baby stuff :) 
Made it back from < PROPMALE > . Wish I could have stayed longer , back to work in the morning . Can't wait to move there in December :) 
Work at 7 in the morning . Hope I sleep better tonight . Haven't been able to sleep the past 2 nights . 
Another sleepless night ... too much on my mind I think . That means work is gonna suck more than usual ! 
My baby < PROPFEMALE > passed her drivers test today ! Yea ! Now she is 100 % legal . Thank you < PROPMALE > for helping her out :) 
ugh ! 
need some tattoo therapy bad ! Its the only thing that works ! might have to give in if i dont make it to MN soon . I hate to settle for less than perfection :-( 
Work in the morning ... I hate early mornings . Searching for a new job , hoping I have some luck . Maybe I'll go back to pharmacy technician if I could find the right employer . 
So tired ... wish I could crawl back in bed . 
thinking < PROPFEMALE > should hurry up and have that baby so we can move asap . :-) 
Had a pretty good day at work . Can't wait to move though . I am very anxious as you might have noticed :-) 
Trying to win tickets on e-bay to see < PROPMALE > Magic ( <3 < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > <3 ) play the bobcats tomorrow night so excited . I miss my NBA . 
Whoo hoo ! going to see my man < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > tomorrow night ! It has been way too long since I have been to a game ! I am super excited ! < PROPMALE > better keep an eye on me or he may be coming home alone ;-) Lower level row B seats , at a decent price . I may take LOTS of pictures :)))) 
Super excited for tonight ! Not a Bobcats fan but I LOVE < PROPMALE > Magic <3<3<3 
The game was amazing ! Magic won by 3 pts . Not only did I see my < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > <3 , < PROPFEMALE > was there too . Whoo hoo ! My lucky day :-) 
Glad today is over with ... hope the rest of the week goes better :( 
Working til 11 again tonight , then guess what ? Off again til Friday ! I enjoy the time off , don't get me wrong but I need the hours so I can afford more trips to < PROPMALE > :-) Think I might stay home this week though cuz I spent too much money on my <3 < PROPMALE > Magic <3 tickets this week . Plus I am off Mon- Thursday next week . Maybe I will go to < PROPMALE > then . 
Could this day get any worse ? I just wanna run away :-( 
well tonight was one of the worst nights ever at work ... very stressful . :( Sure could use some good news or something ... or an escape plan so I can run away . I need out of here ... 
Just talked to my ex for the 1st time in many many years . I can honestly say that he is an amazing person and I am very fortunate to have known him . I haven't laughed so hard in a long time . Lots of good memories . I owe him a lot and I will always be grateful to him for changing our lives for the better :-) 
Any one know any cures for a mid life crisis ? I am having a < PROPMALE > one :-( 
We\ 
are asking everyone to say a prayer for \Darkhorse\ " 3rd Battalion 5th \ 
Treating myself to a haircut and highlights(or coloring ) next week at some fancy salon in Chapel Hill . Got a good deal through Groupon . Can't wait , I need a change , I hate the dark hair . 
went and ran some errands and was feeling SUPER depressed , so instead of coming home and moping , I stopped and walked 2 < PROPMALE > . I feel much better ... at least for now . 
Had a pretty good day at work . Working Sunday and Monday then heading to < PROPMALE > , can't wait . 
Heading up to Roan Mountain to go for a hike today . Should be fun . Hope its not cold up there . 
Well , went for our hike 2 1/2 < PROPMALE > uphill , to an elevation of 6200 feet ! Holy crap ! Went about 5 < PROPMALE > total . I have never walked that much in my life ! I may not be able to move tomorrow , but I am determined to try to get in shape and lose weight . Finally got my willpower under control ... at least for most things ;-) Now just need to stay motivated . 
Long night at work , i am off at 11 and have to be back at 7 in the morning . Ugh ! Gonna be dragging butt tomorrow . 
Wow , what a short night ... got maybe about 4 hours of sleep . Now back to work another 8 . 
Heading to < PROPMALE > in the morning , plan on having a great time , away from < PROPFIRST > !!!!!!! 
Some days a cigarette sure sounds good !!!! 
Getting my highlights tomorrow , super excited . Just did 2 < PROPMALE > on the treadmill at the fitness center . I am VERY determined :) 
Ugh ! I hate geoffreys internet or lack of ! Anyway , my hair looks super cute , i love it ! 
FML !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
So I guess I am gonna be a grandma twice !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NOT HAPPY AT ALL !!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
true friend doesn't care when you're broke , what you weigh , what name \ 
brand you wear , if your house is a mess , where you live , about your \ 
past , or if your family is filled with crazies , they love you for who \ 
you are . A true friend can go long periods of time without speaking but \ 
never question the friendship . Re-post if you have at least one true \ 
friend - they wil know who they are 
Getting ready for work blah ! I hate 2-11 !!!!!!! 
70 degrees and < PROPFEMALE > :-) what a beautiful day ! Don't miss minnesota at all . 
Its official !!!!! I have lost 10 lbs . in 28 days ! So excited ! Now if I can just keep up the motivation and will power I will be doing good . The holidays are gonna be tough . Got a long way to go , but I am on the right track :-) 
Work til 11 Tonight then off tomorrow . My last day working here will probably be the 20th of dec . Cant wait to move ! 
Hope everyone has a Happy and safe Thanksgiving . Counting down 25 days til I am out of here whoo hoo ! I am gonna miss everyone here though . I have met so many wonderful people . I would bring you all with me if I could :-) 
Well , I tried to sleep but that didn't work very well . Have to work 2am-9am , then back at 5:30 pm- 11:00 pm . UGH !!!!! Hope everyone had a great thanksgiving :-) 
Well I survived the black Friday madness ! I don't understand how people can wait in line for hours just to buy stupid crap . I would never go out and fight the crowds by choice ! Now I have to get some sleep and be back at 5:30 . 
Got some very good , much needed sleep last night . Gonna try and be productive around here today . Then back to work at 7am tomorrow . 
Guess what I have been doing < PROPFIRST > ??????????????? lol 
Getting ready to head to work in a bit 7-4 , then gonna enjoy a nice relaxing evening . Geoff has to head back early today to pack his crap , he has to be out of his apt . on Tues . He is supposed to close on the house on Wed ., not even sure if that is gonna happen . I REALLY REALLY want to go to < PROPMALE > on Tues . not sure if I am yet , will know more on Mon . 
Dear Santa ... please bring me a one way ticket to somewhere peaceful and warm . 
Well everything is looking like Geoff is gonna close on the house on Wednesday . I may have to get out of here sooner than I planned ... 
12 more days of actual work and i am out of here . I hope i like where i am going . 
Well the closing got moved to Thursday , I guess that's not so bad . Guess I am not gonna go to < PROPMALE > this week ... Kind of pointless :( Probably won't be able to go for a while now . 
Maybe there really is a < PROPFEMALE > ! I think i may be going to NYC , not sure when for sure but i am super excited . Thank you < PROPFEMALE > :-) I So need a break . 
In case I haven't mentioned it before ... I have the bestest Brother-in-law ever :-) 
Just found out my dad is leaving in the morning for NC . Please < PROPFEMALE > get me out of here FAST ! lol 
Sitting here bored out of my mind ... thinking I should go do the treadmill but not really feeling up to it . I need something to occupy my mind though or these girls will drive me crazy ! lol 
Feeling pretty crappy today . Very congested and a sore throat , < PROPFEMALE > . I am supposed to take Haily to Asheville , but ... maybe I will go crawl back in bed . 
Thanks < PROPFEMALE > for getting me sick ! Time for Alka Seltzer Plus and a nap . 
Now closing has been bumped to monday . Ugh ! Seems like alot of bs , but i guess you gotta play their game . 
needs an \out of order\ " sign today . Feeling absolutely miserable :( " 
Well I made it through about 5 hours of work today . Feeling extra crappy right about now . My dad made it here safely ... he was here when I got home . Gonna go take some medicine and curl up in bed :( 
Change\ 
your FB Profile Picture to a Cartoon from your childhood . The goal is \ 
to not see a human face on FB till Monday December 6th . Support the \ 
fight against Child Abuse by copying and pasting this as your \ 
status ! \ ... dont see how this will help but ok . its fun seeing all these\ 
Well ... I was hoping that I would feel better today , but its not looking good ... :-( 
For those of you that aren't old enough to remember my cartoon character , his name is Grape Ape :-) 
Well today is < PROPFEMALE>'s due date but still no baby ! Which is probably a good thing cuz I am still really sick :-( Working 11- 3:30 today ugh ! 
Well Geoff is on his way back to Raleigh , and he is supposed to close on the house tomorrow . Keeping my fingers crossed and counting down the days . 
I may have to break down and go to the Dr. seems like I keep getting worse instead of better . Just don't want to fork out $150 bucks if they are gonna tell me it's some virus and there is nothing they can do :( 
Well Geoff closed on the house today so I am one step closer to < PROPMALE > :-) Made it through work tonight ... barely . I still feel REALLY miserable . < PROPMALE > congestion and cough , going on 6 days now :-( 
Well I found out my transfer for work is not gonna happen anytime soon . Gonna try a couple other stores , but it's not looking good . So I either have to take a leave without pay , find a new job or stay here and work until a transfer goes through . Maybe I will go to < PROPMALE > next week and start looking . 
Starting to feel better :-) 
on our way to the hospital !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Well we are here at the hospital , looks like he is coming , but it will be a while . Love my baby < PROPFEMALE > so much . Cant wait to meet my grandson ! 
Ugh ! They are sending us home . The dr didnt even check her ! 
Well , we made it home from the hospital ... hope we don't have to make the 30 mile trip again tonight . I am gonna strangle that Dr. if we have to go back tonight ! 
Well , no baby yet . Looks like we may be waiting til Monday when they induce her . 
Well after 2 years I finally broke down and watched Twilight . I actually liked it suprisingly :-) Now have to get the next 2 on my netflix next week . 
Bah humbug ! I am skipping X-mas . Too much other stuff going on . 
wondering what to do . . . life always throws you a curve ball . 
Think I am heading to < PROPMALE > sometime this week if everything goes ok with the baby . Maybe wed or so . Need to go job hunting . Looks like I may be moving everyone else to < PROPMALE > after X-Mas and I will stay here by myself and work until I find something else . :-( 
It sucks when you start losing weight the first place you lose it , is the LAST place you want to lose it ! lol 
I am hoping the weather stays decent . < PROPFEMALE > has to be at the hospital in Morganton by 6:00 am so they can start inducing her . I have a feeling it is going to be a very long day . I guess that means I am gonna be a Grandma . 
Well geoff made it back to the house ... Only to find out the trailer he had borrowed from a co worker had been stolen out of our yard :-( 
Well < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > are off to the hospital , Haily and I are soon to follow . we will keep everyone posted and send pictures asap :-) 
She is getting her epi now . Not too much longer :-) 
Contractions about 2 minutes apart . :-) 
well here we are waiting :-) will keep everyone posted . Ready to meet my grandson :-D 
Phoenix < PROPFIRST > Mauceri 8 lbs 8 ounces 21 inches . My beautiful grandson . 
Time to get ready for bed , it has been a very very long day . So excited to have a beautiful new grandson . He is such a sweet perfect little guy , he just melts your heart . 
Gonna go get ready and go see my grandbaby :-) He is the sweetest baby ever <3 <3 
Well I think I found me a transfer !!!! Whoo hoo . Now at least I can move , knowing I will have a job . AND ... I can move soon :-D 
my babies are coming home this afternoon :-) Plus we have a showing on the house today . PLEASE let someone buy our house soon , 2 house payments suck :-/ 
Gonna check on my transfer today . Working Sun-Friday here , Friday may be my last day here , then hoping to start moving after X-Mas . Geoff wants to get the painting and carpets done before we move in , so not sure how soon that is gonna happen ... 
Haven't hit the treadmill since I got sick , tomorrow I am gonna get back on track . Thought I would have gained some back , but still down 12.2 lbs . :-) 
Just got a call from CVS , about a pharmacy job at a brand new store . Gotta figure out how and where to meet her . She said she would even meet me half way if I wanted . 
Heading to < PROPMALE > in a couple hours for my interview . Hope it goes well cuz I really need a job when I move ! Gonna be a long day , probably about 8 hours of driving . Ugh ! Hope they don't have tattoo restrictions cuz that would REALLY suck . 
Made it home from < PROPMALE > , what a long day . Way too much driving . Interview went good . Will know know more tomorrow . 
working til 8:30 . Gifts in the AM then geoff has to head back to < PROPMALE > to be there for the incoming snow . Fun x mas . 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas . Hope everyone has a safe and happy holiday season . Geoff was supposed to be home til Monday night but he had to head back already because of the snow . If the plows are out , they have to be at the shop in case something breaks ... 
Haven't heard anything on the job ... Oh well if it's meant to be be , she will call . I definitely was not qualified to be the lead pharmacy tech . Guess I better step up my job hunting . Can't afford to sit around very long , and it doesn't look like Wal-mart is gonna come through for me . 
Made it through work , ugh ! They had me up front on a register the whole time . Which I NEVER do . I made it though and surprisingly I had no rude customers , believe it or not . But we were VERY busy . I hurt . I could use a good foot and back massage . Too bad that ain't gonna happen :-( 
Showing house today , working tonight 4-10 and tomorrow 9-5 , then I think I am actually done ... maybe , might work Friday too , lol . Planning on heading to < PROPMALE > on Sunday or Monday . Have a job offer/interview for a transfer on Tues at a < PROPMALE > . Gonna be very busy and be making lots of trips back and forth . ugh ! 
Well , pretty sure today is my last day at work ... although that could change at any given moment lol . I could work tomorrow if I wanted , and if I work Sunday , I get holiday pay for Saturday ... hmmm , such decisions lol . 
Done . If I didn't get to say goodbye to you today , I am sure I will see you lots of times before I actually move . Plus I was already being a big crybaby , don't think I could have handled any more good-byes today . :-( I worked with some of the nicest people I have ever met in my life and I am gonna miss you all ... lots :-( 
Happy New Year ! Gotta keep up my resolution , stepped on the scale and I am down 15 lbs !!!!!!! Whoo hoo ! super excited :-) Haven't seen those < PROPFIRST > in a long time . 
Slept like crap first night in the new house . Hope tonight is better . Way too much on my mind . Having a drink :-) that should solve everything lol . 
Not only no internet at the house yet , cell service horrible too ! Getting ready to talk to the lady about a transfer . 
Looks like i start the 17Th . They actually wanted me to go home and change and come back . I said umm no ! Lol 
Hoping to enjoy my night to myself :-) 
Thinking i shouldn't be thinking so much :-/ 
No internet is driving me crazy ! Hopefully by thursday maybe . But no cell service may be permanent :-( texts work sometimes , calls get dropped . \\n < PROPFEMALE > 
No snow here yet , geoff had to go in from 2 pm til 6 am cuz its coming . Last time he had no power here for 2 days . So i may head to a hotel if it goes out . \\n 
Thank God for libraries :-) Should have came here for internet sooner , but been busy . Just barely starting to snow . Heading back to the house to get some work done . 
so weird havin the house to myself again overnight , it is a very rare thing for me . I LOVE IT ! :-) 
still no snow in < PROPMALE > . We do have a layer of ice on everything . Getting Moving truck friday , should be fun ! Not ! We will probably need about 4 of them lol . 
getting the moving truck in the morning . Cant wait to see my sweet grand baby :-) still not sure when or if i start work next week . 
made it back to < PROPFIRST > , now , tons of work to do ! Lots of stuff to load . If anyone is bored tomorrow , feel free to stop on over and help , I mean visit lol 
gonna load the rest of what we can , gonna have to make another trip back and get the rest . We have way too much crap !!! Time to get rid of about 75% of it cuz we haven't touched it in over 3 years . We have an extra building at the new house(Lacey's future room ) but it is already 1/2 full ! small garage and no basement . Don't really have room for all this crap !!!!!!!!!! Gonna be screwed !! 
well we made it ! Yesterday was the longest day ever . Can't believe how much crap we have . Gonna be making lots of trips to my favorite Cause for Paws ( and a few other places)to donate LOTS of stuff . 
Well , I still am not sure about the whole job thing . I think I may be starting tomorrow ... if they get their crap together . If I meet people even even half as nice as the ones I worked with in < PROPFIRST > , I will consider myself lucky . I miss you all . VERY much :-( 
Guess I am going to work in a little bit ... 
Well I made it through my 1st day at work , went pretty good . Off today then work 7-4 the next 6 days in a row ugh ! Hard to jump into that after being off for almost 3 weeks . 
the training lady told me i couldn't use a nickname and made me put < PROPFEMALE > . Piss me off ! since the day i was born i have been < PROPFEMALE > ! Except to you < PROPFIRST > :-) 
Ugh ! I am so pissed ! What a bunch of bs . Its not like i wanted to be called Pookie ! Its my name ! Job hunting asap after i check with management . 
Off to work , lets see if I can make it through the day ... Next it will be the tattoos . Which I know isn't policy but they will come up with some BS , then I will really be pissed !!!!!!!! 
FML . I need to check into going back to school . Reality sucks ! Calgon take me away . . . far away . ( or you < PROPFIRST > ) jk i know you have been offering . 
made it through the day , now only 4 more to go til I can go job hunting . Actually today wasn't so bad ... only had one fainter in jewelry . But I had to pierce a 3 week old baby :-((( 
off to work I go , at least I am done at 4:00 , thinking I should have picked the < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > instead of the I40/42 . ugh Not that that would probably be any better . 3 more days then I will be job hunting . 
Barking dogs and crying babies sure do make for a long night ... and a long day :( 
thinking that a tattoo would lift my spirits , maybe I will check out a couple shops I have heard about on Wednesday . Hmmm look for a job or get a tattoo ... tough choice . TATTOO of course :-) 3 days off in a row . Then Geoff gets to go back again this weekend and paint and clean more . 
desperately need a good something lol ! Been very down lately :-( any suggestions ? All i can think of is a tattoo . 
I just gotta make it through today , then 3 days off . Even though my girls are older ... they still act like children when they don't get to see me . I think they are just as excited as I am about my days off lol :-) 
Gonna enjoy my days off , maybe unpack some shit . Lord knows I have plenty of it ! Gonna figure out what to get for a tattoo for sure then go check out some shops . 
Going to < PROPFIRST > on Monday for an appointment . Hoping to stop in and see some friends while I am there . I miss you guys :-( . 
< PROPFEMALE > and I went and < PROPMALE > out for a while . Had to get her out of the house , she needed some time away with her mom :-) We had Chinese and it was disgusting . Gonna enjoy my night alone , well after I kick the kids out lol . Take a bubble bath and relax :-) 
well its off to work today , 2-10 . My first night there so it could be interesting . Working tomorrow then Monday I am heading to < PROPFIRST > for an appointment . Haily may be coming with me . Not sure if we are spending the night or not . Probably , cuz then we both have time to see some friends . 
Ugh couldn't sleep and had to get up for work anyway so here I am ... ready , and I don't work for 2 hours lol . Heading to < PROPFIRST > tomorrow morning , not lookin forward to the 4 hour drive . 
Talk about a boring day ! Hopefully work picks up after lunch . It feels like its about 65 out :-) too nice to be at work . 
heading to < PROPFIRST > in a bit , probably gonna spend the night and come back tomorrow . Hoping I get to see some friends while I am there but I am gonna be tied up quite a bit . I wish < PROPFIRST > was closer :-( 
Heading back to < PROPMALE > in a couple hours . Got to see a few friends :-) may stop back by work and visit some more . I miss everyone alot :-( 
Made it home safe and sound . Didn't get a < PROPMALE > to stop back by and visit . Sorry :( I was supposed to work at 7 in the morning but they called and now I get to work 2-11 ugh ! But at least I don't have to get up early :-) 
It was71 here today :-) no blizzard for us . 
Feeling pretty crappy today . Got the whole cough , sore throat and achy crap :( working 7-4 and going on about 3 hours sleep or so . Not gonna be a good day .

never mind now its working lol . Stupid thing has been acting up all morning . 
I think its nap time :-) 
Think i may hit the nyquil and go to bed soon . Still feeling pretty crappy :-( 
well work was a mad house and as busy as it was you would have thought the time would have flown by , NOT ! Suppose it didn't help that I didn't feel good . Back tomorrow 2-11 so no super bowl for me . oh well don't care . lol . 
Well yesterday was an utterly miserable day at work , felt like my nose was a faucet lol . Gonna do a whole lot of nothing today and self medicate :-) 
Feeling much better :-)

enjoying my job more than I thought , but gonna enjoy my day off tomorrow even more :-) 
Well I stepped on the scale and I am down 21.6 lbs . super excited :-) Now I can reward myself with a tattoo :))))) 
I swear my chat hates me on here , it has been doing all kinds of weird stuff for the past 2 weeks , going off and on , and telling me it was down for maintence ? wtf ???? 
gotta go get ready for work , hoping that place isn't a zoo today , and that I don't work with the pushy old bat . She gets on my very last nerve .. 
what a long day ... so very tired . Think I am gonna eat , take a nice hot bubble bath and go to sleep :-) Geoff and grampa wont be back til midnight probably . I am probably heading to < PROPFIRST > this week , as a very dear friend lost her husband yesterday :-( 
If anyone finds out any details on < PROPFEMALE>'s husbands funeral . please let me know ASAP . Please !!!!!!! 
Gotta get ready for work soon , ugh ! At least it will be a short night :-) Making tacos for the family first . Probably heading to < PROPFIRST > on Friday . 
I guess I will break down and wish everyone a Happy Valentines Day . ( even though I would rather say bah humbug ) 
Champagne ...

time for work ... ugh :-( so very tired . 
Worked my butt off today !!! Definitely gonna enjoy my day off tomorrow :-) 
Trying to get my stuff packed , heading to < PROPFIRST > tomorrow when I am done working at 11:00 am . Stopping back by to pick up Haily and then we will be on our way . Gonna drop her off at a friends probably and I have to stay with Geoff's mom cuz there is no heat at our house :-( 
Well we made it to < PROPFIRST > safe and sound . Now we are being lame and hanging out in wal mart parking lot trying to find something to do lol . 
Bored out of my mind , but stalling , cuz i am not ready to go to geoff's moms yet lol . 
It was good to see everyone back here in < PROPFIRST > . Wish i could have seen more friends :-( it was very nice to get all the compliments on my weight loss :-) 
Made it home safe and sound , hoping next time , I go back , I can meet up with some other friends :-) 
went out to dinner , without the kids , ( so much cheaper ) wow kids really are expensive ... especially when they are adults ! lol It was nice to get out of the house for a change :-) 
Keep love in your heart . A life without it is like a sunless garden when the flowers are dead . The consciousness of loving and being loved brings a warmth and a richness to life that nothing else can bring . ~ < PROPFIRST > Wilde ~ 
Watching the baby , then gonna shower and get ready for work , ugh I HATE 2-11 . I can get so much more done when I work 7-4 . Which I have to do in the morning . 
Ugh !!!!! 
Wishing i was somewhere other than work ! I hate this shift :-/ 
Heading out to work shortly , seems like I just left that place ... wait a minute , I did 7 hours ago . Ugh ! 
Its a beautiful 78 degrees here today :-D 
Enjoyed my night off and some southern comfort :-) 
I hate my chat , I hate my chat , I hate my chat !!!!!!! 
Still 63 degrees here , seems wierd to sleep with your window open in february :-) 
Taking Haily to her baby doctor appointment today , then gonna try to unpack some boxes , or at least try to find some normal dishes and silverware lol . I have been lazy ... I hate to unpack :-) 
An old man once said ... There comes a time in life , when you walk away from all the drama and people who create it . You surround yourself with people who make you laugh , forget the bad , and focus on the good . So love the people who treat you right , pray for the ones who don't . Life is too short to be anything but happy . Falling down is a part of life , getting back up is living ~ Re-post if you agree 
One of the ladies I work with , told me she thought I was about 22 yesterday . Lol Of course I told her I loved her :-) 
Working from 5am-2 pm , running on about 3 1/2 hours sleep . Both of my forearms are full of bruises , cut and scratches . Pretty sure I will have a few more by the end of the day . Good thing I can come home and take a nap :-) 
gonna have myself a drink and enjoy my night to myself :-) ( well except for < PROPFEMALE > , Haily , < PROPFIRST > , Phoenix and 3 dogs LOL ) 
Heading out for work in a little while , I am soooooooooo very tired :-( Gonna keep looking for a different job , this one they work me like a dog , screw with my hours , don't pay me what they should and expect me to work 40 hours a week , but yet only give me part time benefits . Ugh ! Can you tell I am kind of cranky ? lol :) 
Think i am coming down with that stupid cold again . Only working til 3 today , than back at 5 am mon and tues . 
Get to find out Thursday what my Haily < PROPFEMALE > is having , super excited !!!! 
There are 3 things you will always hold in your heart . Someone you will never forget , someone you will never forgive and someone you will always love ... 
Made it through another VERY long day ... I hate going in @ 5:00 . Gonna enjoy my next 2 days off very much :-) 
Polishing off my southern comfort :-) 
Looks like i am having another grandson :-) 
Lovin my magic and < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > :-) 
Just realized i forgot my anniversary on march 1st , 7 years smoke free ! Yea me ! :-) 
Heading out to an interview in a while , not gonna get my hopes up though cuz I don't think it's what I am looking for . Plus It's almot an hour drive and with the rising cost of gas , I would probably go broke driving back and forth lol . Oh well doesn't hurt to check it out . 
Well , we got a weight bench with some other features , so I decided that on top of my diet , I am gonna lift weights ... and exercise . Lifted for a little bit , gonna start out slow lol . I figure as long as I am losing so much weight , I better tone up too :-) 
It's pretty bad ... I consider sleeping til 7:00 sleeping in . I guess it is compared to 3am or 5 am . lol 
I passed the 25 pound < PROPFIRST > !!!!!!!!!!! Yea me :-) 
its so nice to see all the trees and flowers blooming and green grass . It makes of happy :-) 
Well , I took Haily to the Dr. cuz she has been REALLY sick since yesterday , they gave her some anti-nausea medicine and said it was viral . If she gets worse and becomes more dehydrated , they are gonna admit her and pump her full of fluids . My poor baby :-( 
Heading out for work in a bit . sure enjoyed my days off . Too bad they went way too fast :-( I was supposed to have Sat , Sunday and Monday off , but they f'd that up too . Ugh !!! 
Working 2-11 today ... I hate that shift big time !!!!! Kids have company coming today , their step mom , grandma and brother and sister . I am super excited for them to see our baby phoenix :-) 
Wishing i was somewhere other than work ... 
Got home from work tonight ... and < PROPFEMALE > , our 12 year old < PROPMALE > short-hair dog had passed away :((( I am very sad ... 
Happy < PROPFEMALE > her Mom and the kids made it here safely . Too bad they have to head back tomorrow already . 
Took everyone out for supper tonight , and it ended up being free cuz their credit/ debit card reader went down . Can't beat free food :-) . Now having a drink and gonna relax :-) 
I have a personal reason for ASKING if everyone could please put this as their status for one hour . I know the ones that will !! Think of someone you know or love who has had cancer . My wish is that in 2011 a cure will be found . Will you post it ? Just for one hour ? Do it for all . There are too many to mention who have fought and are fighting . I would love to see this in the status of all my friends 
Heading out to eat for our anniversary 14 years . Wow !!!!!! 
Really enjoyed having < PROPFEMALE > , her mom and the kids here . Hope they can stay longer next time so we can take them to the beach !!!! Hope they have a safe trip home . 
Heading to work in a bit . Gonna try to cram about 12 hours worth of work into 8 hours as usual . I love my job ... not !!!! 
Had to go to the hospital earlier , Phoenix flung himself onto the floor and smacked his head . Thank God he is OK !!!!!!!!! Didn't want to worry anyone unnecessarily . 
Took my girls out for Chinese it was delicious ! Hopefully gonna have a stress free night :-) I had enough stress today ! 
Off to work I go . They really f'd up my schedule this week ! 1-10 Tues , wed and Friday in adult apparel and Thurs 6:30 pm -11 in adult apparel ugh !!! They have their heads up their ass big time at this store !!!!!! 
working 1-10 today , wed and fri and thurs 6:30 -11 . Somebody has their head up up their ass . lol My dept manager NEEDS me there 7-4 cuz there is no one else to help her . We have lost 3 ZMS's and 1 dept manager this week , great place to work lol . 
Havin a pretty good night at work . It makes a big difference when you are not doing everything by yourself . 
Tried sushi for the first time today ... I was not impressed . 
Sitting at the hospital with Haily , she has a bladder/ possible kidney infection . She is running a fever , 24 weeks preg . Looks like its gonna be a long night . 
Well they are gonna keep her overnight to make sure everything is ok . 
I hated to miss work . But my baby girl is way more important . She seems to be doing better , now we just have to see what Dr. Says , 
Well everything seems to be going pretty good . Now we are waiting for the dr to find out some test results . 
Looks like they are gonna keep her overnight again her fever is back up again . my poor baby :-( 
Came home to change and shower . They were getting ready to do an ultrasound on Haily's kidney . They are gonna keep her overnight again . Hope they get it under control soon :-( Going back to stay with my baby . 
well Haily spiked another fever :-( That means another 24 hours for sure . Wish they could figure out whats going on !!!!!
