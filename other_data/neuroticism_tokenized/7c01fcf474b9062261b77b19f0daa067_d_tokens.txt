Ow . I got stabbed . Crazy bitch . 

This shit is gross . www.popthatzit.com 
I fucking hate kids . So much . 
It's my birthday . Yay . Now I sleep . 
Thanks to all for the birthday wishes . They are much appreciated . :-) 
< PROPFEMALE > Bragg and the Terminals are awesome . I just heard them for the first time on Pandora , and was blown away by Seventeen . 
My sister's boyfriend is awesome . I am 1000 times happier than I was ten minutes go . 
The new Jace planeswalker is incredible . I have a feeling he'll be the most expensive one yet , even though he's being released in a small set . -0 for brainstorm is incredible , especially with fetchlands in standard . 
I just ordered a free 10 day e-cigarette trial . I really hope they are as good as advertised . 
Happy Pi Day , for the next hour or so . 
Wisconsin's alright . It's pretty much exactly like Iowa except slightly worse in every way . I just want something to change . Absolutely no clue what , though . 
Books are awesome . Why don't people read more ? 
Finished kafka , at least everything besides his novels . I'll get to those later . Salinger next ? Maybe Shakespeare ? There are far too many books to read and far too little time . I'm sitting in a library , and I'll only ever know a fraction of what's here . Maybe Borges was right , and God rests as a single character on one of the pages contained herein . I'll probably never know . 
Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia is the fear of long words . Damnsnap , son . 
Death is kind of like life , only more boring . 
I want to play a show . If anybody's having a house party or something , fucking call me or something . I want to play for people . There's little more joy than putting on a good performance . 
Bored , bored , bored , bored . God damn , holy mother fucking shit ass bored . 
I'm trying to learn Santeria . Turns out hard solo is fucking hard . And by that , I mean I need to practice more . \

Back to my beautiful Sanguis ( guitar's name ) . 
I think I'm guitarted . Stupid hard work not paying off very quickly at all . 
Yay . Going to Chicago ! Yay ! 
I am a very courteous Magic Online opponent . About 1/3 of my opponents are the same . Are the remaining 66% retarded children ? 
I want a drummer who is inexperienced , but feels decent . i am a guitarist who is inexperienced but decent . Also , a bassist . mostly , I want a simple folk/punk band who is willing to listen to my ideas and disregard me completely . Let me know . 
I was feeling depressed , walking in Chicago with my friend . I looked down and found a pack of cigarettes and a nug of chronic . I gave away the pack of cigarettes to a homeless man . Weird how things turn around so quickly . 
Five Rhythms is incredible . I'm going to have to start it in Iowa City . 
Bored , bored , bored . Anybody want to do something ? 
Shooting stars :-) 
Nothing to do . If anybody wants to < PROPFEMALE > out tonight , send me a message . I still don't have my phone . 
I hate this feeling . \ 
I need to leave this town . Get out . Find something new . \ 
But I am trapped here . \ 
That inevitable feeling crushes everything that feels good , leaves me hollow , and all I want to do is be somewhere else , and I know I can't . 
Has a main squeeze , so to speak . 
Complicating complications are complicated . 
So hard to focus on Spanish homework . I just want to play Icewind < PROPFIRST > 2 ... 
Question : Are you able to form a mental visualization ? Of anything ? If yes , how detailed ? If no , have you thought about it before ? Did you just assume that people described mental visualization as a metaphor ? 
La di da di < PROPFIRST > . La di da di da . 
I have homework to do . I can't focus on it . It's really easy , but I just can't focus ... 
If you like Bukowski at all , I highly recommend Barfly . It's rhythmic comedic poetry and extraordinarily well executed . If you don't know who Bukowski is , then check him out , because he is amazing . 
I just beat Soul Caliber 2 Arcade mode on the hardest setting . :-) 
i have a real simple tattoo design I would be willing to pay for . I'd have 150 bucks on it , and another 150 when the back piece got finished . it's easy to do and I have a job that should let me budget for it . Anybody who'sinterested ,,, text me . 
Fucked up plus magic online means I win ... :_) 
Somebody call me to < PROPFEMALE > out . Don't feel awkward about it . My number is 319 594 3672 . If you want to get dinner , I'll even pay for some/most/all of it depending on where we go . 
Opening up a Koth is a good feeling . Especially when the pool itself is awesome . 
Spanish homework ... Spanish homework ... Spanish homework ... \ 
Nope , still thinking about a girl . 
I think I want to start learning French next year . Estudio ahora español , y me gusta español , aber jetzt ist mein Deutsch unartikuliert , und daran ich studieren muss . Wenn ich nachsten Jahr Franzosisch studiere , < PROPFEMALE > ist es warscheinlich , dass ich im Ausland in zwei Jahren studieren kann . Por lo tonto , voy a estudiar a la año frances . \ 
I really wish I could say that all of that means what I want it to mean . 
I got to spend all night discussing theoretical physics with my friend , and discovered that quantum physics makes a lot of intuitive sense , and that my basic view of the universe is actually moderately in line with our current understanding of quantum mechanics . It was exhilarating , and I haven't learned so much in such a short period of time in a while . Also , the universe is a weird place , but pretty awesome . 
Sometimes , life is good . This is one of those sometimes . 
I'm having an incredible week . I went to see a poetry slam tonight at Tspoons with my lady . I've made the finals in 10 of my last 14 drafts , so my limited rating's back above 1800 for the first time since Ravnica block . And I don't work today because I'm going to a PTQ in Nebraska . \ 
It's certainly true that Things Fall Apart , but at the moment it seems everything's falling together instead . 
A las barricadas ! A las barricadas ! Por el triunfo de la confederacion ! 
\Men who pursue a multitude of women fit neatly into two categories . Some seek their own subjective and unchanging dream of a woman in all women . Others are prompted by a < PROPFEMALE > to possess the endless variety of the objective female world . \ " - < PROPMALE > Kundera " 
I have a test in the morning . I didn't realize this until about 15 minutes ago . I haven't studied at all . \ 
The test is going to be over Personality Disorders , Substance Abuse , and Sexual Deviancy , however . \ 
I feel oddly prepared . 
And when you're running good , you keep running good . I'm in an impervious good mood right now . 
I want a case of 40s of St. Ides for my birthday . I'm going to see if I can get < PROPFIRST>'s to special order some , but if anybody can get it to me before December 6th , I have a 30 dollar tip for them , in addition to covering the alcohol costs . \ 
Probably a fruitless endeavor , as I've been trying to do this since 2004 without success , but just putting it out there for anybody who wants to make me exceedingly happy . 
I just drafted a G/U infect proliferate deck that's pretty sweet . My first round opponent was remarkably immature and confrontational . He said \ur deck is bad . U/G isn't a viable archetype\ " and \ " So bad . Your a terrible player with a bad deck . You keep getting lucky to beat me . \ " \ 
I think I might have a metabolism issue . Since work I have eaten ; 2 cans of creamed corn , 3 cheese quesadillas ( each with two tortillas and two layers of cheese ) , 3 containers of yoghurt , half a box of shredded wheat , 12 oz . of pasta with < PROPMALE > sauce , a < PROPFIRST>'s personal pizza , 8 dry packets of cocoa , and an orange . \ 
Note that this is after working at a pizza place . Where I am constantly eating/grazing on food . 
Thanks everybody . Especially those of you I haven't seen in far too long . It means a lot to hear from you all . :-) 
< PROPFIRST > Assange is the first visible , global hero in this war . \

\I would come in with music on a CD-RW labelled with something like \ 
I'm all about complete transparency . \ 
I just have a problem giving my information to somebody who's trying to take it from me . 
\A study published in the South African Journal of Science showed that \ " pipes dug up from the garden of Shakespeare's home in Stratford upon Avon contain traces of cannabis . \ " [24 ] The chemical analysis was carried out after researchers hypothesized that the \ " noted weed\ " mentioned in Sonnet 76 and the \ " journey in my head\ " from Sonnet 27 could be references to cannabis and the use thereof . \ " \ 
I would give just about anything for a guitar to play over break .... 
A copper spectre steals across her face , \ 
this sanguine omen stains her grace , \ 
and I grow weary , she is weak , \ 
and ' till this spectre's gone\ 
she holds no sway over this place . 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas everybody ! I love all of you . \ 
Especially you . 
I need to find the cheapest way back to Iowa , immediately . \ 
Any suggestions ? 
Hopefully , I'll be back in Iowa City by Wednesday . If I spend any more time here , I'm either going to shoot myself or my mother . \ 
And yes , I'd rather be in Iowa in the middle of fucking winter than in Florida , with my mother . 
Thank you all for being so understanding and supporting . I've always felt that chosen family was much more important to me than biological family . That's only been confirmed . 
So ... why don't we have < PROPFIRST > Hyde in as a receiver ? It seems to me that he has the best field vision of any Hawkeye . 
Score : -1 afternoon +1 original arrangement of Broadripple is Burning 
Let's see how creative my Facebook friends are ... Leave me a 1-word comment that best describes me using the THIRD letter of YOUR FIRST name ... It can only be 1 word ... Then copy and paste this to your wall so I can leave a word about you ... Don't just post a word & not copy ; that's no fun ! 
One day I wanna copy someone's status word for word and see if they notice . 
I think I figured out how to play the blues . 
Do not , as some ungracious pastors do , \ 
Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven , \ 
Whiles , like a puff'd and reckless libertine , \

And recks not his own rede . \

It's one AM , \ 
I just awoke , \

Still seem to get by . 
As much as I love getting punched in the face ...... 
I got punched in the face tonight . I didn't do anything .... 
To everyone who is calling for stricter gun laws in light of the tragedy in Tucson , may I offer this little tidbit : If guns kill people , then pencils misspell words , cars drive drunk , and spoons made Oprah fat !

My shooting < PROPFEMALE > burns so bright , I'll shame the sun into lighting the night . 
An Arlington TX police officer is accused of threatening members of a SWAT team , who arrested him on an aggravated sexual assault charge where he is accused of choking and sexually assaulting a woman , which occurred while he was on unpaid leave on allegations he arrested an innocent man , which happened while he was under investigation for allegedly making sexual advances on a woman he pulled over in October .

* Relevant Statistical Unit 
Nobody sees quite so clearly as me , the thousand different meanings of to be . 
My mere existence is an act of persistent defiance , and my reliance on crutches is a symptom , not the cause . I wanted to die before I ever got high , and I'm not gonna lie , I'll never b e healthy , but maybe I can create pretense , and maybe that pretense is really the cause , and I'm lost , I have no voice , and vice is the root of my existence now , even if it is only a symptom . 
Anybody wants to give me a ride in the next hour , then I can give them fair compensation in all shades of green .

If anybody's looking for anything to do , I'm hopefully going to be playing open mic tonight at Gabe's . Not sure when , but I'll try to play as late as possible , so people can get there . \ 
Speaking of which , if anybody could give me and my guitar a ride to open mic night at Gabe's ... 
You guys are amazing . \ 
Lots of things make me happy , \ 
but nothing quite as much as\ 
good friends . 
Words cannot express the depths of my motherfucking frustration . \ 
I want to break something . \ 
And I want to do it tonight . 
If your dad is a hard working man and your hero , loves you no matter what or is just the best dad ever , if you're blessed to still have your dad or he's an angel in heaven , place this on your status and let everyone know you are proud of your dad . You can replace a lot in life but you only have one dad .

\Where did my jacket go ? \ " \ 
I'm probably playing open mic tomorrow night at Gabe's again . \ 
The more people who post something here , the more likely it is to happen .
