Yum ! The best kind of donut in my belly ... jelly filled . But that's still not stop me from thinking about how much I've grown up . < PROPMALE > already ! How come I'm in only one who can't believe it ? 
If only you would answer me then you'd know how much you hurt me . 
I talk about the hood . \ 
I say stuff like it's all good . \ 
Tell people I'm down with all the cool kids downtown . \ 
When I've never even been there . 
Going to the fair-air ! Going to the fair ! 
Lots of energy with no where for it to go ! Ahhhhhhah . Need to find something to do ! 
Oh my god ! I got to looking around facebook and found all these people who I knew from middle school . They have changed so much . Some are taller , some are not a rail anymore , some have piercings . I wonder if they find mine and feel the same way . 
Great first performance ! I was barely nervous . Just wish that the show had been longer . 
? Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock ?? Bad me , bad ! That's song's dirty . ;) 
Hi , I'm < PROPFIRST > . ( Hi < PROPFIRST >.) And I'm an irregluar youtube addict . 
RIP < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Cosby Sr. Sorry you died of kidney failure . You had your quirks but they're what made you my uncle . Love and miss you . 
I love showering . You get to wash away all of the germs , dirt , grime , and smells of yesterday . You can forget all of the emotions , drama , the crazyness . And start over completely clean . 
I want to answer questions ! Will you ask me one ?

I put you up on a fucking pedastal . Just to be devastated , when I find the truth out . 
Sorry , I try to be your voice of reason . Sorry , I want to keep you from making a fool of yourself . Sorry , I care about you . 
Flashlight tag tonight at 7 at Anyssa's house ! You know you want to . 
I get through everyday without you , and I'm alright . 
I could lay down and sleep for eternity . Also , my feet are the dirtiest they have ever been in my life ! 
I need a stranger to talk to . They don't know you so all their judgements would be shallow and there's no reason to speak to them when it's all done . Would you be my stranger ? 
Count to 10 , close your eyes , and we'll pretend you haven't died inside . 
Who wearing pajamas tomorrow ? Me ! Will these pjs be more conservative then I normally wear ? Yes ! How come that last question sounded dirty ? Cause you're a perv , baby .

Clovis Movie Theater , I've noticed that you get pretty busy sometimes like Friday Nights , Saturday Nights , and Sunday at 2:30 in the afternoon , so you need to get an usher to help people find seats at those times . Oh , by the way , I'm pretty good at asking people to move over . ;)
