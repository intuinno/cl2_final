Happy New Year !!!! Happy 2011 ! I hope 2011 is better than 2010 ! 

Huskies beat Nebraska !!! Ur a lOSER if u thought they would lose , jk ! Nebraska was supposedly a great team going against a no name team ..... but they lost , and stopped the game at the last 40 seconds or so ..... they are losers ! Ur supposed to go out fighting , not quitting ! 
I am so glad school is over , except that I cant see my friends almost every day . But summer will be fun ! 
I just got a facebook today ! I am glad I did ! It is really good to keep in touch with friends over summer if u r to busy to visit them ! 
Summer break ! It has been okay so far , but I miss my friends at school , does anyone else feel the same way ? 
The best things about summer : no homework , hanging out with friends , being able to stay up late , and sleeping in !!! 
Summer break has been awesome so far ! It keeps getting more fun and better ! I cant wait till we go to The Great Wolf Lodge and to Ocean Shores ! 
Summer has its busy days , almost worse than having homework days at school , but still not a bad ! 
The cove was fun !! Its to bad that the people who didnt or couldnt come didnt ! 
my chat on facebook isnt working , what about you guys ? 
Yeah , my cha finally works ! 
In loving memory of every cancer patient , family member , and friend who has lost their battle with cancer , andthose who continue to conquer it ! Put this on your < PROPFEMALE > for 1 hour if u know someone who has or had cancer , or lost the battle . Many won't copy and paste this . I did , will you ? 
I saw Inception and Eclipse . Inception was great , but I could barely hear it because it was a dive in and < PROPFEMALE > and I werent in the car and airplanes kept going by ! But the movie was great ! Eclipse was better than the other twilight movies , but it was awful !!!! I dont know what some of you guys see in that movie , no offense ! 
I have been watching Supernatural and Jericho again ! Their awesome ! You guys should watch them ! :) :D 
Happy Birthday < PROPFEMALE > !!!!!! 
I got my camera today !!!!!!!!!! I am thinking of putting one of my pirates of the caribbean glow in the dark stickers on it !?! What do you guys think ? Kailah ... I cant wait till you come over so we can take pictures ! If you do get to come over , lol ! I love taking picture so much ! 
I miss my friends ! But mostly Kailah , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , Bronson , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , and Gabby ! But I still miss other people too ! Summer has gone by too fast though ; so I guess it means I was having lots of fun ! I hope u guys are having a great summer too ! But see u all in september 
many people r doing this ; so might as well : like this status and I will tell u what I like about u ; what my first impressions were about u ; and stuff like that . :) 
I just got back from seeing vampires suck ! That was a really funny movie ! I am so glad that they came up with a movie to make fun of Twilight ! Everyone should go and see it ! On Saturday I get to go see Dispicable Me ; how many of u guys have seen it ? It looks hilarious ! 
Saw Kick-ass when I got hom ; but before that I saw Vampires Suck ! I hate how they made the mist a bad guy ; he was one of my favorties in the movie ! But both of the movies were great ! I think I like Kiss-ass a little more though ! 
Who`s all going to registration today ? I hope to see u guys there ! Even though it sort of sucks going to school ; we have 13 days till school starts ! Its sort of exciting and sort of not ; right ? 
Children with special needs don't have an illness , so there is no cure and it's not contagious . They want what we all want ... To be accepted .

It's special education week and this is in honor of all the kids who need a little extra help and understanding .

I don't understand why Cupid was chosen to represent < PROPFIRST>'s Day . When I think about romance , the last thing on my mind is a short , chubby toddler coming at me with a weapon . \

There are so many things that we dont know . Like life .... it is such a mystery .. you never know what tomorrow will bring . You never know if there will be sorrow and pain , or joy and happiness tomorrow . But there are a few things that I do know . One thing that I know is that when I am with you , I dont worry about tomorrow , I go with the flow and enjoy every second that I am with you .
