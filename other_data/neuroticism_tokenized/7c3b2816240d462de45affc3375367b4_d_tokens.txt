Shopping in < PROPMALE > sucks ! I want to get outta town ! 
My Baby can Read !!! I swear ! This thing really works ! 
I'm having a little trouble trying to find an SUV that I like . I have always been a car person , but if I'm going to buy something it needs to be and SUV ( considering I live on a huge hill ) . Dodge Journey looks good to me ! 
Got my XBiking out of the way today . Nothing going on , but Parents as Teachers tonight . 
Think I'm going to give in and make some M&M cookies or maybee M&M brownies . Then when I have my couple I will take the rest away to someone else ! muhahaha ! 
HB and I are doing some serious shopping tomorrow . Mills Mall here we come ! 
We shopped until we dropped , or atleast HB fell asleep while I continued to shop . Didn't get me a damn thing for myself though . Had too much fun buying her new clothes . My dumbass left my coat on a chair at the food court for like 2 hours w/ my phone and my house keys in it . Luckily I came back and it was STILL there ! Big relief . :) 
By the way , I have my own money ! So , go flap your jaws about that !

Bought HB a fish and an aquarium today . Opened the box for the aquarium and it was cracked down one whole side ! I hate taking stuff back ! grrr ! 
April Fools !!!! bahahahahaha ! 
Have to miss Pilates tonight because my daughter doesn't like being alone in the Y nursery . Think I'll wait til it feels cooler and take her for a walk , so I don't feel bad about missing . 
God doesn't give you the people you want in your life , you're given the ones who will love you even when you are not very lovable . 
Got 2 great girls in town this week . Better get my homework done so I can have some fun time . Maybe I'll be able to celebrate after my big test on Saturday . That would be fantastic-o !

Note to self : next time you buy a fish make sure to check for both fins . No wonder the damn thing is hanging at the bottom of the tank ! 
Maybe its just been awhile since I've seen a squirel , but I don't remember their ears being so big ! 
Finished hanging all < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE>'s clothes for the garage sale this weekend , separated them all in sizes and throwing a big fat $1 sign on the rack !

When you consistently maintain a positive frame of mind , you'll become known as a problem-solver rather than a complainer . People avoid complainers . They seek out problem-solvers . Hope everyone has a great week !
