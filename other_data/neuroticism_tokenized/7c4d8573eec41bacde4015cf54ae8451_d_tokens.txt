So why do you leave these questions unanswered ? The circus awaits and you're already gone , my Chesire cat doorstop with fear in your smile , what makes it so easy for you to be walking by ? And what did I do that you can't seem to want me ? Why do we lie here and whisper goodbyes ? Where can I go that your pictures won't haunt me ? What makes it so easy for you to be walking by ? 
And there was never any place , for someone like me to be , totally , happy . I'm running out of clock and that , ain't a shock , some things never do change , never do change . 
< PROPMALE > Adams is a loser . Bwahaha . 
is a total wimp . Also , did not enjoy reading her poem in English . Ew . 
Dressed by < PROPFEMALE > and out the door , no light , she memorized the floor , so she could leave without being detected . She works till three , it's uniform , she dreams that he'll come by the store , she prays for days that boys mean she's protected . And she wants someone to see her , she needs to hear she's beautiful , she's beautiful . I want to save you , I want to save you . I need you , save me too , I want to save you . 
is like a bag of < PROPFEMALE > from Halloween . Varied . Eclectic . Weird . People like different parts . Sometimes sweet . Usually delicious . and I kind of want to burn that poem . XD 
You don't do it on purpose , but you make me shake , now I count the hours til you wake , with your babies breath , breathe symphonies , come on sweet catastrophe , well , maybe this time I can follow through , I can feel complete , stop paying dues , stop the rain from falling , keep my ocean calm , this time I know nothing's wrong .

Oh < PROPMALE > 2011 . It was nice to get a few hours of sleep this morning after being awake for 46 hours straight ... Maybe if I resolve to get more sleep this year , my body will actually adapt ... 
The firsts of 2011 I've accomplished thus far : High five ( < PROPFIRST > ) , kiss ( a dog licked my nose ) , dance party ( I'm pretty sure our rendition of the Narwhal song occurred after midnight ) , shopping trip ( and hopefully another will not occur soon ... ) , and game loss ( < PROPFIRST > Krause . Of course . )

Dear zinch.com, That is a bamf scholarship . Too bad it relies on my profile being awesomer than other people's . And ... apparently I can't think of things that are awesome about me . So . My zinch profile = not bamf and scholarship winning esque . 
I'm a bitch , I'm a bitch , oh the bitch is back , stone cold sober as a matter of fact . I can bitch , I can bitch , cause I'm better than you , it's the way that I move , the things that I do . 
is GOING to have a productive weekend . Really . Today I made breakfast and lunch at the appropriate times . And finished Brisingr . And with much deliberation bought 2 books and 2 CDs . Well there was only deliberation over one of the CDs , but there was a lot of it . And I'm knitting a gauge . I don't think I've ever been unlazy enough to do that . 
got an electronica/dance cd and OK Go's new cd . And it is all pwnsome . 
In the dream you were someone different , you and everyone else all at once . You were beautiful , you were beautiful . In the dream you were just like you are . You loved everyone like a sovereign - half magnanimous , half unimpressed - and I was talking too much , I was trying too hard . In the dream it was just like it is . 
It's coming down , babe . Could be as bad as they talked about . It's coming down , babe . Could be before we can make it out . But when they say that all is lost , all is not lost , all is not lost . But when they say that all is lost , all is not lost , no , all is not lost at all . 
enjoys driving in the dark with the windows down in the cold . And speeding . And not slowing down for speed bumps . And Walgreens . And swedish fish . And pokemon . And ok go .

Miyazaki , I'm still wondering why the catbus has balls XP 
Garrison Summers is a facebook whore . And he knows it . XP 
Why does my carbon monoxide detector eat through batteries ? It's plugged into the wall , the battery in there should just be a backup . But it's still like OM NOM NOM BATTERIES . And then when it decides the battery's low it makes obnoxiously high pitched beeps . At least it didn't start at like one am . I'd be pissed . 
J'aime faire cuire . Particulièrement pain arménien qui me donne < PROPFEMALE > petit déjeuner pendant comme deux semaines 
I almost forgot my camera . And the fact that there's a hot tub . And ski socks . Der de der . 
13 hours in 5 inch heels starts to hurt in the last few hours . But I love jazz festivals . And the fact that the falconaires played Nature Boy . One of my favorite songs evar . However , I do not love whoever arranged the dixieland swing on what a friend we have in jesus handbell piece . It's physically impossible for my part . I mean REALLY ? 
One pill makes you larger , and one pill makes you small , and the ones that mother gives you don't do anything at all , go ask < PROPFEMALE > , when she's ten feet tall 
Hmm . I should probably be doing something . But instead I'm sitting here listening to music , wandering on facebook , and eating pistachios . PISTACHIOS FTW . 
Uhm . I was holding a hershey's kiss above my candle to warm it a little . And ... then it slipped . And I got chocolate in my candle and candle in my chocolate . I did not see this coming . 
Good game tonight . We put up a good fight . Hockey kicks ass . 
The Saints ' last touchdown was epically epic . 
Hey . I can't see lanes and the street is shiny . That's not cool . Yet I drove home as I always drive , with my windows down and my system up . I'm just that BA . Also , every time I hear Girlfriend by < PROPFEMALE > Lavigne I remember < PROPFIRST > Touney singing it that one time . Ahh ...

Alright . Writing a resume so a teacher can write a teacher req . Have advanced classes taken , school activities , other stuff , community service . Anything else ? Think Mertz'll care if it isn't typed ? 
You know what's good ? Eating cake because Garrison isn't here . Sucks for everyone who wasn't in the band room during lunch . Cause I had cake . 
Here's my philosophy on < PROPFIRST>'s Day : If you're single , you're supposed to sit around and feel sorry for yourself . If you have someone , it's supposed to be to celebrate your love or happiness , & c . ... but if you're in a good relationship then shouldn't you feel that way every day ? ... yeah . Therefore : < PROPFIRST>'s Day is being used to pressure people into buying stuff for each other . The end . 
There's one thing I want to say , so I'll be brave , you were what I wanted , I gave what I gave , I'm not sorry I met you , I'm not sorry it's over , I'm not sorry , there's nothing to save . I'm not sorry , there's nothing to save . 
Everybody with a helix piercing should communicate with me in some manner . Where ya got it , $ ... etc . 
I wish CSU could process all the paperwork faster ... Somewhat distressed .

Hm . There are some facebook groups that I completely forgot that I joined . Such as : , Cat + Toast = Anti-Gravity , When There is Nothing Left to Burn , You Have to Set Yourself on Fire , and < PROPMALE > Rather Fan Club . I am reamused . 
Well although I didn't have any revelations about math at Calculus : The Musical , I did enjoy it . It was like ... math put to song to confuse everyone who hasn't taken calculus . 
I'm gonna legally drive one person for the first time xD w00t ?

Today , I read a MLIA wondering if British people like American accents as much as we like their accents . Fellow MLIA-er , I know you were doubtful , but I just got home from an educational tour of the British Isles , and the first store I went in , I asked the cashier what they think about American accents . A customer shouted \I FIND THEM QUITE SEXY ! \ " The cashier agreed . So did the rest of the store . Win . MLIA "

I'm trying to lucid dream more often so I'm double checking the time . But what if I'm in a dream now and every time I double check the time I'm changing my dream subconsciously so that the time remains the same when I double check it ? 
Dear printer , I actually was NOT interested in printing a picture in shades of pink . I gave you nice photo paper and made sure to set up the tray so it would be aligned correctly . Why would you betray me so ? 
So full . And I only had like an eighth of my plate . Zios fills my stomach with happiness .

Everybody interested in the next bracket for the assassination game , meeting tomorrow in the senior courtyard , 12:10 . $1 buy in . Current rules and such : Air Academy Assasination Game 
< Guo_Si > Hey , you know what sucks ? < TheXPhial > vaccuums < Guo_Si > Hey , you know what sucks in a metaphorical sense ? < TheXPhial > black holes < Guo_Si > Hey , you know what just isn't cool ? < TheXPhial > lava ? 
greatly enjoyed watching Ponyo with Kellybelly , Jonbon , and Link :P 
Prom was fun and < PROPMALE > looked awesome and I failed at the electric slide :P 
How is it already halfway through April ? I do not approve . 
It's a beautiful day to not be in Boulder :D 
I don't mind spending every day out on your corner in the pouring rain 
Dear clouds , I apologize for saying that you flunked cloud school earlier . And that you needed teaching ( damn straight ) . DO IT UP CLOUDS . DO IT UP . 
Jazz trip was pretty awesome . Never put your phone where there is possibly leaky valve oil . Phone is now shot -_- RIP Nugget 
Next year I'll be living in Newsom . Btw . 
My love is like lightning . 
Jazz concert . Tonight . AAHS . 7 . Auditorium . It'll be awesome . 
two scoops of ice cream - 67 cents . win . 
Hey < PROPFIRST > , don't make it bad , take a sad song and make it better , remember to let her into your heart , then you can start to make it better 
So I may not have gotten much homework done today , but I did find something to save up for over the summer and discussed the possibility for a business . So it was a productive day in a way ... 
So , pretty much , I own at tetris . That's all . 
\Hmm ... a bit poky . \ " \ " Do you know what poky means ? \ " \ " Like ... nosy ? \ " \ " No . \ " \ " Touchy ? \ " -poke poke- \ " No . \ " \ " ... sharp ? Pointy ? Mountainous ? \ " \ " No ! You're being a little poky right now ! \ " \ " ... slow ? \ " \ " Yes . \ " \ " ... so what could the word be ... \ " \ " Look at it ! \ " \ " Slowish ? That's not a word ! \ " \ " It is in crossword land ! \"" 
\What's that a sketch of ? \ " \ " A penis . \ " \ " The Starship Enterprise . \ " \ " ... I'd be kind of disturbed if < PROPFIRST>'s first guess was correct ... \"" 
Yeah ... I was only planning to take like 20 minutes ... But I should've figured otherwise once I walked in the door :P True . True . 
It's < PROPFEMALE > Wars day , May the 4th be with you . 
You know what needs to happen ? Rock band party . Well , not necessarily a party , I just need to play some rock band . I want to work on my guitar playing and singing at the same time skills . Welcome Home needs to be played on this occasion . Because I like that song . That is all . 
Can someone give me a ride home from the AP lit test tomorrow ? 
So .... Think Mertz'll let me postpone that anatomy quest since I had AP classes ( and thus no classes ) yesterday and today ? Cause I missed stuff ... 
had to help dad < PROPFEMALE > a mattress and box spring up stairs . Cause apparently mom can't < PROPFEMALE > things ... or move rectangles around corners . Also : I need the zoo ... 
It could be wrong , could be wrong , but it should've been right . It could be wrong , could be wrong , to let our hearts ignite . It could be wrong , could be wrong , are we digging a hole ? It could be wrong , could be wrong , this is out of control 
Happy mothers ' day ! AKA study for AP bio test day ... Wondering : mothers ' day in Australia ? Dyou guys do it ? 
Staring into the intersection , she thinks that she can fly and she might , holding on in a new direction , she's gonna try it tonight . The closer I get to feeling the further that I'm feeling from alright , the more I step into the sun , the more I step out of the light 
I'mma dinosaur . So like rawr and stuff . 
I just heard something on tv about cheese whiz . I remember the conversation at lunch and had to start laughing ... 
The title of the fourth chapter of The Shining is Shadowland . Hahahaha 
Does anyone know what time we have to be at that thing tonight ? 
You know what makes me sad ? Tomorrow . T_T 
Today didn't feel extraordinary . I didn't even cry at the exit assembly and I thought I would ... I guess I still haven't left mentally 
Anybody want to help me clean today ? :D I'm sure if you do I'll have a meal and/or delicious baked-good type snack in it for you ... 
Lacuna Coil = good music to clean to . I think it helps when the songs aren't in English 
Lock and load , baby , the printer's running full-time . And not in shades of pink . 
Looong day . Parties were awesome . Water balloons + roof ... Being kickball gods ... Scavenger hunt ... Yeah . Schweet . 
What is \traps\ " short for ( the back muscles ) " 
Nevermind . I need a nap > < 
thought I lost my pokemon deck . Almost had to build a new one . But it was just buried under some of the other cards . Lucky break for < PROPFEMALE > . 
\He's possessed ! \ " \ " He's insane ! \ " \ " He's my kinda guy ! \"" 
\They're all so beautiful . Why don't I have three heads ? \"" 
Parties = awesome . Scavenger hunt through my house to find a gift = awesome . Uhm , pretty much last night just = awesome . 
You're hypnotizing me with those eyes and that smile , I think I'll be here , I think I'll be here for a while 
Summer . New ipod . Amazing boyfriend . Awesome friends . Life is good . 
First day of workcamp : we're gonna be in cars all day . It's 7 in the morning . Do not try to make conversation with anyone . Go to sleep like a normal person . 
Rule of long drive snacking : Don't buy chocolate at a gas station . It'll just melt & get all over everything . Beef jerky is non-melting , better for you , & tasty 
pulled out 936 nails and staples from a roof today . Woo . 
The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return 
Just entered Colorado . Ah , I've missed it 
This weather is beautiful ! 
Go storm go ! 
is excited for the movie marathon of epic proportions tomorrow . With a person of epic proportions ... of awesomeness ? That makes sense in my head . 
8 hours of < PROPFEMALE > , Pinocchio , Pocahontus , Labyrinth , Totoro , some delicious watermelon , and < PROPMALE > ! An excellent way to spend 8 hours . 
I'm not going on one of those little < PROPFEMALE > go round things again . Kthxbye . 
Today was a good day . And I had an excellent evening hanging out with some awesome people . 
This week I'm gonna finish my thank you notes and apply for even MORE jobs and clean some stuff and finish at least one book and watch more movies with < PROPMALE > ! and play some green day rock band and watch another movie with Jonbon and Kellybelly and Staceface and < PROPFIRST > . Pretty much : this week shall be awesome and productive just not on the same days ... 
\Why are you going there ? That's expensive ! \ " \ " It's the semi annual sale ! It's not AS expensive ... \"" 
Oh the joys of power outages ... 
< PROPMALE > python and the holy grail , a bug's life , space jam , and the adventures of < PROPFEMALE > the pooh . And < PROPMALE > ! Awesome . 
Okay that was tasty . Good steak , good fries . Om nom nom . 
Anyone want to check out Squeak with me sometime this summer ? I haven't been in but it sounds awesome 
Antz , < PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE > , and tarzan . Antz had a ridiculous amount of cursing for a PG rating . < PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE > was kind of ridiculous . And < PROPMALE > is ridiculously cool ! 
Alright guys , can anybody recommend me a hair glue ? Not hair gel . I want like super hold hair glue . Preferrably not salon brand , I wanna go to walgreens ... 
Jonbon , check your mail . 
Can someone lend me a copy of the first < PROPMALE > Potter book in .... awhile ? I wanna reread the series . But I'm about to start a < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > book . So not very soon 
Mini golf + Iron Giant + Mulan + half of A Goofy Movie + < PROPMALE > = super awesome 
Aww , somebody's got a frowny face ! 
\You got the money ? \ " \ " You got the manners to say hello first ? \"" 
AP scores :D 
Random driving with < PROPMALE > for over two hours was fun ! The quarter had a thing for left turns and getting us into the middle of nowhere though 
Random romantic movie scence fail . 
So I'm still kinda sick but I am officially signed up for college classes , saw a cool comedy group , & almost beat an Iraqi war veteran in final round of zip zap 
Got the first < PROPMALE > Potter book , The Resistance by Muse , and lots o dorm stuff . Pretty much awesome . 
Anybody out there have a < PROPFEMALE > Studio 14 ? Opinions ? 
loves Muse and their new album . Alternative rock with some French , a clarinet solo on one song , a couple of piano solos , and a strings section . Yes , Muse rocks . 
Inception . Was awesome . Go see it . Oh my goodness . 
\Hi Nary ! \ " \ " Bye Nary ! Octal ! Hexadecimal ! \"" 
Well now I can say I've been in a dumpster ... 
Well . I'm off to get a tooth removed . When you next hear from me I shall be one tooth less wise . 
< PROPFIRST>'s opinion on me having only one wisdom tooth : \You need to reproduce so you can pass on the one wisdom tooth < PROPFIRST > . Maybe one day humans could have none . \"" 
My macaroni is shaped like toy story characters . You are jealous . 
This week I'm gonna totally finish thank you notes , my lists of stuff to pack , uploading pictures , applying for scholarships , and ... try to keep stuff clean . :P 
\Crispy is like restaurant speak for we did something horrible to your chicken \"" 
The power just died with the poor computer running ... D: but ! Shopping with < PROPFEMALE > yesterday . Hanging out with cats , cookies and band camp today . < PROPFEMALE > on fb :D 
I love my band kids ! 
I gots a guard dog . And a super awesome boyfriend . :D 
Well I'm just a little black raincloud ! 
New computer . :D 
So somebody should lend me a flash drive before Wednesday ... 
Uhm . Did I lend Abhorsen and Lirael to someone ? Cause I can't find them in any of my bookshelves ... and I kind of want to pack them . So . 
So ... packing . Uhm .... aaaauuuugggghhhh . 
The packing continues ... 
Anybody need an AB calculus solutions < PROPMALE > ? 
Any marching band kids want two pairs of white gloves ? You'll want to wash them ... but they cost no money and are hole free . 
Inception = awesome movie . < PROPMALE > = awesome person . Inception + < PROPMALE > = an awesome time . Next time you see me online I'll be in Fo Co ... 
So welcome activities ... not so fun . But piles of free CDs are pretty awesome . Especially when I happen to be the person to find the two CDs from bands people have actually heard of . Free < PROPMALE > Zombie and < PROPFEMALE > Manson CDs . You're jealous . 
So ... turns out my computers hate me . I tried playing a song on itunes that I transferred from my old computer via flash drive . Won't play because it can't find the original file . Seriously ... 
In Fo Co and ... mostly organized :P 
Hey you CSU kids . Does AV have pretty good breakfast or would I want to expend the energy to walk farther for morning noms ? 
Does MS office communicator hate everyone ? 
gets an A+ for the ability to get lost . I am a getting lost master . 
I love having an iPod touch ... Today it got me back to my dorm and helped me when I realized I didn't know what room to go to in the chem building :P 
... WHY is OK Go's Colorado stop in the upcoming tour on the day I have one of my chem tests ? Why does this happen ? 
So ... four different sites for me to find homework . What the pooh bear is that ? What happened to a paper that tells me what my homework is or working out of my book instead of on a website ? What if CSU's entire internet system happens to fail ? I would fail all of my classes . That's what . Except for chem lab ... 
Bedtime for < PROPFEMALE > Mardiguian , because she has French at 9 . And she does not want to be tired , or she'll forget keys like she did today ! Bedtime for < PROPFEMALE > Mardiguian ! ( This works to the tune of Springtime for Hitler ... in case you were wondering ... ) 
When I'm doing my French homework online my browser keeps informing me that the < PROPFEMALE > is in French and asking if I'd like it translated XD 
Week one of college done . Weird . 
Homework . Yeah economics . 
Hey mister , where you headed ? Are you in a hurry ? I need a lift to happy hour , say , oh no . Do you brake for distilled spirits ? I need a break as well , the well that inebriates the guilt , 1 , 2 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 
What day is it ? Ah , that's right , it's the day of the < PROPMALE > Mountain Showdown . You know what they say , \I'd rather have a sister in a whore house than a brother at CU\ " ;) " 
I'll stop the world and melt with you , you've seen the difference and it's getting better all the time , there's nothing you and I won't do , I'll stop the world and melt with you 
I <3 my Jazz ! :D but I miss the other Jazz D: 
I thought I was a fool for no one , but oh baby I'm a fool for you 
To the window , to the wall 
DCMI : 2 weeks . 
Dear Tuesday , I am coming for you . Prepare to be better than Monday or I will kick you in the face . Sincerely , < PROPFEMALE > . 
It's sad when getting mail , even when it's two thank you cards , is exciting because it means that the mailbox wasn't disappointingly empty XD 
30 pages into One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and quite enjoying it . 
One of the urinals in our bathroom is running ... again ... 
... thought I did a lot better on the test than that . Rawr . 
My apologies to anyone who doesn't like the Lonely Island and was in the bathroom when I'm On a Boat came on ... my ipod was on shuffle . 
Work work work , I have a lot of work ... 
Everybody needs to sleep at night , everybody needs a crutch . But couldn't good be good enough ? Cause nothing doesn't ever change but nothing changes much 
Oh Wednesday , how I loathe you

Crash and burn , crash and burn , crash and burn , < PROPFEMALE > is the hallmark of the old and the infirm , live to learn , live to learn , live to learn 
Half an hour phone call with < PROPFEMALE > wasn't long enough ... but it's something ! Haha \Oh you're there ! You ARE a person ! \"" 
Well hey there Colorado Springs , how have you been ? 
Hit at a lope , running already down the slope . Can't get back , can't go ahead , look down the barrel an ' you dead dead dead . 
I was in my backyard with my cat and somebody a few yards down starting playing a scale on a trumpet . I forgot how much I missed that sound . 
Dear AAHS band kids , \ 
Good luck tomorrow ! I love you guys . Do it up . \ 
Sincerely , < PROPFEMALE > . 
I'm not crazy , I'm just a little impaired , I know , right now you don't care , but soon enough you're gonna think of me , and how I used to be 
Haha I've lost ten pounds since I went to college . Take that freshman fifteen ... 
Good weekend . Home . Owl day ... Got myself a nice new calligraphy pen and inks and some artist trading cards ... Got a box of teas from England from Dad's business trip . Band pwnd as usual . And dinner with < PROPFEMALE > . 
Just saw a runza in Colorado . What ? 
Listening to Espionage by Green Day makes me feel like a secret agent . 
Why can't you just admit it , you've had it , you're sick of me , you're fed up with all my bad habits , you're sick of me 
Wherever you go , you know I'll be there , if you go far , you know I'll be there , I'll go anywhere , so I'll see you there 
\Sleepiness .... I has it ... \ " \ " .... did you say silly penis ? \ " \ " No . \ " \ " Okay . That's why I was thinking you don't have that ... \"" 
\Oh look what the color of the inside of my stomach is . \ " \ " You got some on your sock ? \ " \ " Yep . \ " \ " Is that purple ? \ " \ " I had pb and jelly . \"" 
Talk is cheap and lies are expensive , my wallet's fat and so is my head , hit and run and then I'll hit you again , I'm a smart ass but I'm playing dumb 
In French today we were talking about money and different words people have for a dollar . My teacher said dolla dolla < PROPMALE > , somebody quoted Lazy Sunday , and we started talking about the Lonely Island . 
I <3 you AAHS . Pomona grand champions threepeat . 
Feel free to tag anyone you recognize in my Pomona pics 
Just saw Despicable Me again . Still love it . It's so fluffy I'm gonna die !!!! 
So it's a good thing I've taken 3 years of French cause studying for that exam tomorrow isn't really getting done right now ... 
I like it wherever . 
Two of this week's exams done . One to go . I'm thinking a nap after class tomorrow to make up for this week ... and the past three months or so ... 
Tests are done for the week and classes are done for the day . Naptime for < PROPFEMALE > . 
Today my French teacher described something as being \a minefield of awesome . \"" 
C'mon chemistry tests , stop it with the roofies . A letter grade better than the average is alright , but still . Why must you trick me so . 
Dear Air Academy marching band , \ 
Good luck tomorrow ! You will be spectacular . \ 
Love , < PROPFEMALE > . 
So movie marathons ... We're bad at them . Partly because people felt the need for halo breaks between each movie . So the second half of saw marathon = tomorrow . 
October is cancer month . In memory of every cancer patient , family member and friend who has lost their battle with cancer and in honor of those who continue to conquer it ! Put this up for 1 hour if you love someone who has or had cancer . Many won't copy and paste , I did . Will you ? 
The saw theme will now probably be stuck in my head for several days . Oh yes . 
Tie Tuesday tomorrow :D 
Right about now I'm pretty happy that I have tea and hot chocolate here . And much thanks to < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Baker for the kettle thing :D Also , there was an enormous puddle to called to be splashed in , but I figured people around me wouldn't be too happy about that so I just waded through the deepest part . I have water halfway up my calves :D 
does not feel spectacular . 
If you're a short band kid , you should see if someone will let you get on their shoulders for those pictures of the band with trophies after competitions ... otherwise you might go through 4 years of band and never get in any of those pictures and then feel bad when you accidentally get into one after you graduated ... 
I realized today that nearly half of my credit hours for one week occur on Wednesdays . Ridiculous . < PROPFEMALE > subbing was nice though . 
Watched Jackass the movie last night . Then remembered homework . Going back to bed now . Thank you five hour break between classes . 
A wonderful several hour nap . Slept through a phone call for a chipotle run , but caught them on the phone while they were still there so I still get chipotle <3 
8 hours of outdoors and dogs . Now parents . Not sure when homework is going to fit into this weekend . 
My iPod is currently syncing to everything on my laptop since it decided to erase everything from my computer at home ... go iPod go . Gotta love it . I'll just have to finish transferring the music from my old computer next time I'm home . Now for a day of homework . Woo . 
Woah . I'm going to sleep and it's not even tomorrow yet . And I already finished my ALEKS for this week . I'm not sure how this happened ... but I approve . 
Ah Monday ... even when I go to sleep before midnight I am not ready to wake up for classes . 
Why is the < PROPMALE > Potter premiere on a Thursday ? If it had been just one day later I wouldn't have had to wake up for classes and I would've seen it in the Springs ... oh well . We need to get those tickets ... soon . We only have a month . 
Bible study and a long phone call with my best friend last night was an excellent break from working . And so far I've found no spider on my clothes so this morning is better than yesterday morning already ! 
The person in the room next to mine is watching Pocahontus :D Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn < PROPFEMALE > , or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned ? 
Just bought tickets for the < PROPMALE > Potter midnight showing :D and ran to my room and back with my debit card so that I could get tickets as quickly as possible . No way was I letting them sell out . 
Wednesday , oh Wednesday ... Why do you make me do so much . Wednesday . I am not pleased with you . Yours bitterly , < PROPFEMALE > . 
We have journals for French and our latest one is whatever topic we want to write on . I wrote about why I hate Wednesdays ( except for pre vet club ) . 
just remembered that I don't have French tomorrow since my group had our conversation today . So tomorrow I get to sleep in and I have one class :D 
http://shanahanigans.com/comics/fancomics/simplypotterific/sp08.htm I forgot about this comic :D ahhh < PROPMALE > Potter ... How I love you . And being home . 
Dear Air Academy Kadet marching band , \ 
I love you guys . Take state tomorrow :D \ 
Love , \ 
Cathy\ 
\ 
P.S. For the mellies : Obnoxious yelling . 
Air Academy won 1st at marching band state in 4A and all three caption awards ! Way to go guys , you were phenomenal ! Photos and videos to come 
had an awesome time at applebee's with the band kids . And I miss < PROPFIRST > Griner doing silly things ! ( p.s. chesticles ) Somehow I'm still hungry after a 12 oz steak and cake with ice cream . I don't know where it all goes . 
Awesome and busy weekend . Some < PROPMALE > Potter rifftrax , state marching band which AAHS owned , celebratory ... food at applebee's ( don't think I can say dinner or breakfast since it was around midnight ) , I now have more than 2 pairs of pants , and there was lots of singing on the drive up . 
Ah , I knew going to bed at 3 and waking up at 7:30 would catch up with me ... 
Ski season has officially begun in Colorado . Yes . 
Theme for next year's Halloween costumes : Gagas . All of us from different music videos . < PROPFIRST > . < PROPFIRST > . < PROPFEMALE > . < PROPFEMALE > . We could pull that off . 
Squeak is adding butterbeer to their flavors on November 5th . So this means I can go to the < PROPMALE > Potter premiere , then get some butterbeer the next day :D If you live in Colorado Springs and you've never been to Squeak ... you're missing out . 
Hey look . Snow . 
When marimba rhythms start to play , dance with me , make me sway , like a lazy ocean hugs the shore , hold me close , sway me more . Thank you for that , shuffle function on my iPod ! 
I missed signing up for the trip to the vet hospital today which is kind of disappointing , but I met with my advisor and made my four year plan . Which is both productive and really exciting . 
Hmm .... CSU / CU hockey is this weekend .... I enjoy hockey ... but I have no way to get to < PROPMALE > and I don't want to spend $20 even though that can get me 3 college hockey games and an Avalanche game xD 
This hoodie is like a little piece of heaven , easily attained from the guy's section of walmart . 
\Time is like a squirrel with rabies ; it's always moving until animal control comes and kills it . Not a perfect simile . \ " - < PROPMALE > Blanton " 
Thursday . You are such an excellent day . Only had to go to one class , had lunch with < PROPFEMALE > , got stuff done , and soon going over to < PROPFIRST>'s for some Corpse Bride and part one of my Halloween transformation ... 
Chem got out half an hour early and I don't have too much homework ... so it's time for a < PROPMALE > Potter break from working ! :D I'm almost done with the seventh book again again again . 
is excited . 
So everyone really needs to watch the video I just linked to ... it may make your day . It definitely did mine . 
Give me a listen , you corpses of cheer , least those of you who still got an ear , I'll tell you a story make a skeleton cry , of our own jubiliciously lovely corpse bride 
Feeling much too lazy and sleepy to put up pictures now , but I shall ... Monday . After all of this weekend's festivities have concluded . 
Things to be excited about : It's Halloween - free < PROPFEMALE > . The new milkshakes they have at the express . Oh my goodness . Not have much work to do . Going to an awesome party . Being attacked by an adorable cat . The person who came to the party dressed as L . Finding new piano music . And , of course , < PROPMALE > Potter !!! I can't stand all the excitement ! 
\What does that wispy little brat have that you don't have double ? \ " \ " She can't hold a candle to the beauty of your smile . \ " \ " How about a pulse ? \ " \ " Overrated by a mile . \"" 
Excellent weekend . Went to an awesome party in Boulder , went trick or treating with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > , and saw Piranha . Which was fairly gory , but still really funny . And there was a < PROPMALE > Potter preview :DDDD so excited . 
I was smelling preservative for part of my fiction class . Which is odd because that class is in < PROPMALE > ... How much of a geek am I that I sort of enjoy that smell ? 
Pretty good day . Finished reading < PROPMALE > Potter again :DDDD got let out of fiction early so the prof could see all of the game . IV bible study . Almost done with ALEKS .... 
Today I was introduced to tvtropes.org . Possibly one of the most addicting sites I've ever been too , and I'm not even sure why . I'll be spending hours in the next few weeks on the < PROPMALE > Potter pages alone . <3 
Oh my goodness . If you like Totoro and South Park , you really need to watch the new episode of South Park . Really bad . It'll be on again at 10 , or you can watch it online soon at southparkstudios.com . It's very awesome . 
has a perfect start to get into vet school :D I have to rearrange some of the classes I was going to take , but whatevs . Now for some < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > and then some piano :) 
From 7 last night to 8 this morning , I got about eleven hours of sleep . I'm still tired . Something is wrong here . 
Has anyone ( at CSU ) taken chem 113 and/or < PROPMALE > 110 ? If so , have you had < PROPMALE > , Finke , or Dysleski ( for chem ) or Turetzky , McCulloch , or Rollin ( for logic) ? 
Dear registration , \ 
RAWWWWRRRAAGGGAHHHHASDHFFASFASF . \ 
Sincerely , \ 
< PROPFEMALE > . 
Long day . Schedule creating , the lady looking over my papers at the health center said my hair color is awesome , I don't have chem the Friday before Thanksgiving , I got a longboard , ate dinner on the roof of noodles , and saw Saw 3D . ( saw saw ... ha ... ) So yeah and stuff . 
An hour of lonboarding in the parking lot with the Haskells , now enjoying an ice cream drumstick ... life is good . 
Good weekend . Got my board and a pretty sweet helmet , got some stuff done . Also , watched Panic Room and The Nines . I would HIGHLY recommend The Nines to people who like movies that make them think . This week ... 3 exams . Two of which are tomorrow . Not so fantastic . 
Uhm . Really tired . Apparently the extra sleep I thought I got this weekend did not make up for the past three months ... so done with trying to do anything productive . But feel free to text me , apparently I don't make much sense when I'm tired so maybe you'll get a kick out of it at least xP 
I'm actually feeling ... not exhausted ! Amazing ! I should try going to bed before midnight more often ! Alright Monday , time's up . Let's do this . LEEERROOOYYYYYYYYY JJJEEEEEEEENNNNKIIIIIIIIINNNNSSSSSSSSS !!!!!!!!!!!! 
And if you're beautiful what then , with yellow hair , like wheat , I think we shall not meet again , my little dove , my sweet , < PROPFEMALE > ... 
Seriously ... ALL the stat 301 and 307 classes are full . < PROPFEMALE > ..... 
Dear Colorado , \ 
You can hardly call this snow . I am merely slightly chilly and somewhat damp . Here's a challenge for you : MAKE ME PUT ON A JACKET . \ 
Well now I've rearranged things for next semester since all the stat 301 and 307 classes filled up . Just have to pray that the classes I'm looking at now don't fill up too ... 
One week from tomorrow . Okay . Awesome . And then another day after that I get to go home . And seeing as I have an exam in every class either this week or next , I have nothing to worry about over break ... Can't wait for HP , squeak , and chilling with < PROPFIRST > Krause . < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim ftw . 
Snowwwwww :DDDDD 
Question of the evening : am I actually not feeling very sleepy naturally ? Or is caffeine having an affect on me for once in my life ? Or am I tricking myself into thinking caffeine is having an affect on me ? Also , why am I on facebook and dA when I should be studying for my AREC exam ? 
Colorado :\ 
Yes . This is what I was talking about . This snow . It's awesome . And it's nice out . Thank you . \ 
My iPod : Mastodon -> Machine Head -> Mudvayne -> System of a Down ... \ 
Me : ... okay . Something is going on here . That ... is not probable . Metal is not THAT great a percentage of my music ... oh wait I accidentally made a genius playlist off of Hearts Alive . This explains it .... \ 
At least I figured it out > < 
So far the problem I have with black ops : I get a lot worse at call of duty when I can't double wield PP2000s .... 
Okay . I have my schedule all figured out . And I'm FAIRLY sure none of these classes can fill up by tomorrow morning at 10:10 . Oh school ... 
Today begins the < PROPMALE > Potter marathon . One a day till the Deathly Hallows . 
\HF eats through your tissues and nerves . So you won't feel your HF burn until it's too late . Which is SWEET . \"" 
Free zoo day :D ! 
I miss < PROPFEMALE > Air Academy band kids ! Also , six days ! :D !!!! 
Gahhhhhh homework . I do not enjoy you . 
All right , Sunday , we have a fair amount of work to do ... Let's get down to business ! ( also , 4 days :DDD ) 
just looked at the audio files on the Air Academy band website ... Bayou Breakdown for WE and Abracadabra for SB ? Both of those songs ... I love them . I want to be at the concert where these are played . Kthxbye . 
My videos for both Air Academy and Arapahoe state finals performances are up on youtube . In case anyone was wondering :P I have a few videos from awards but I'm not sure what I'm doing with them yet . 
One advantage coffee has over tea : It stills tastes good when it's not hot . If it's the one kind of coffee I drink XP 
Over the mountains and the sea , your river runs with love for me , and I will open up my heart and let the Healer set me free . I'm happy to be in the truth , and I will daily lift my hands , for I will always sing of when your love came down 
Forget about your boyfriend and meet me at the motel room , you can bring your girlfriends and meet me at the motel room . Ah the memories :) 
Oh chem lab practical ... You tricked my mind into thinking this would be something I might enjoy . By the words lab practical , my mind went -> anatomy -> joy D: 
Contemplating ... Go to prevet club or take the extra time to study for my chem exam ? 
My normal Wednesday + chem lab practical + chem exam + headache for going on four hours now = ... not cool . 
What is that mysterious ticking noise ? Not over here , not over here ... It's kind of ... catchy . 
< PROPMALE > Potter . 10 hours and 20 minutes . SOOOO CLOOOSEEEE 
< PROPMALE > Potter . It is excellent . However , I am saddened that < PROPFEMALE > Blanton couldn't come ... 
T_T camera .... I want you back . Be in < PROPFIRST>'s car please ? Otherwise I will be very sad and my father will be very mad . 
So , how long do you guys think it would take someone who might have accidentally picked up someone else's camera at the midnight premiere to realize it and turn it in to the theatre's lost and found ? 
CU v . Kansas State . Senior Day . Have an awesome last home game seniors ! ( i.e. < PROPFEMALE > Mardiguian ) Buffaloes , Buffaloes , Go CU ! ( that just happened ) 
Spent the day reading my fiction homework , playing piano and flute , singing , making pancakes and some Christmas cookies ( there are now 10 kinds in my house ... we're slacking XD ) and about to make < PROPMALE > and cheese . Good start to break ? I think so . 
Dude , I totally miss you , I totally miss you , dude , I totally miss you , all the time . 
has now seen Home Alone . So anyone who was keeping track of the pathetic number of movies I've seen , it is now slightly less pathetic . Also , it's snowing :D 
Baking cinnamon sugar muffins for breakfast ? Yes . And then going out and getting new glasses ? Another yes . 
My dream shipped Hermione and Draco ... Except I think it was a costume party or RP or something , not actually Hermione and Draco . So I'm really not sure as to who my mind just shipped . 
Oh t-bone steak , you were so delicious ... Good thing I kept myself from eating the filet < PROPFEMALE > section , I'm not sure how well 18 ounces fits in my tummy 
Hey , so everyone should come to Squeak soda shop at 2ish . Listen to some good music , < PROPFEMALE > out with some cool people , have some delicious things to eat/drink . I'll make cookies . And maybe , if you reply to this , you'll get to choose what kind of cookies I make . 
\Which is < PROPMALE > Potter's wand arm ? \ " \ " ... and there are three choices ? \"" 
It's almost midnight ? O.o I'm not sure how that happened . Bedtime for < PROPFEMALE > .... Night all ! 
Duet practice and Squeak with < PROPFEMALE > Yund :D I somehow kept getting the obvious questions at the < PROPMALE > Potter game ... 
Happy Thanksgiving everyone ! ( Also , those of you living in Australia ... do you guys celebrate Thanksgiving ? Just wondering ... ) 
just discovered that we still have < PROPMALE > Potter sprinkles from who knows when . Moons , Sorting hats , lightning bolts , and Nimbus Two Thousands . xD 
Don't want to reach for me , do you ? I mean nothing to you , the little things give you away , and now there will be no mistaking , the levees are breaking . All you've ever wanted was someone to truly look up to you , and six feet under water , I do 
had an awesome evening of trips to the mall , blockbuster , and squeak , the South Park movie , uno attack , random youtube videos , and pillow attacks with < PROPFIRST > Krause , < PROPFIRST > Weaver , and < PROPFIRST > Souville Baker ! ( Just realized we never found out which way to blockbuster was faster .... derp . ) 
\I am going to punch you in the ovaries . \ " - < PROPFIRST > Krause " 
Peak kia : It's a great idea ! 
Guess who doesn't want to work on her term paper and is going to get a burger and milkshake instead ? Hint : It starts with a Ca and ends with a thy . 
I like how some of my dreams as boring as all get out and others are like movies . Last night's included adventure , romance , friends during traitor , there might have been magic ... and seemingly invincible enemies who we discovered how to beat . It was pretty much epic . 
Dear Christmas radio station : Sorry to break it to you , but the Lord's prayer isn't a Christmas song ... nice try though xD 
So I should probably invest in a stapler xD Paperclipping a term paper is not quite as professional ... but my paperclips are shaped like treble clefs , and the paper was on The Beatles ' Apple / Apple disputes , so it kind of works . 
Said woman , take it slow , it'll work itself out fine , all we need is just a little < PROPFEMALE > . 
Oh hey , Wednesday , thanks for the punch in the face . You're a real bitchkitty of a day . Same time next week , I guess . 
Christmas at church = recruiting season . I've been called into service for choir , brass , handbell choir , and handbell quartet on Christmas < PROPFEMALE > xD 
Panera or Noodles ? 
Aw , I lost my rice krispy treat ... how on earth did I not notice a huge chunk of rice krispy treat falling out of my hoodie pocket ? Dx 
\It is cold . Puppies are warm . \ " \ " ... what about dead puppies ? \"" 
wishes that people would take their laundry out of the dryer when it's done . There were 4 dryers that were done when I went down to transfer my stuff from the wash , I waited 10 minutes , and no one came to empty them . I kind of felt like a < PROPMALE > taking somebody else's bathrobe out , but really , I didn't feel like waiting another who knows how long , and why was your bathrobe in a dryer by itself anyway ? 
Oh my goodness I'd forgotten just how long the Return of the < PROPMALE > is . It would be such a problem if I had French today . 
Spilled hot coffee over both my hands and the sleeve of my favorite hoodie ... What a fantastic start to the day >.> 
This is not my day . 
\Shit ! \ " \ " Hey . En francais . \ " \ " Merd ! \ " \ " Bon . \"" 
Contemplating ... take my 20th century final , or replace whatever score I might get with the average of my past three tests ? 
I think CSU should have a primal scream during dead week ... I would enjoy that . Also , sure I'll do the < PROPFIRST > thing . Have at it . 
e^(n*i ) : ... you would . You're pretty awesome . But your school kind of sucks . You know this is true . 
... X# ? Or maybe bla . I'm not quite sure which part of this was meant as the number . YOU ! Are super cool ! And I miss you ! We definetly need to < PROPFEMALE > out / longboard . Christmas break . It's happening . 
got an 85% on my first college term paper . I worked on it for two days xD 
Last day of classes ? How did that happen ? Also , they forgot that it's supposed to be country music Friday in the ram's horn . My ears are pleased . 
Anybody know why I'm up at 1:40 in the morning ? Cause I'm really not sure ... 
I'm not in the scene , I think I'm falling asleep , but then all that it means is I'll always be dreaming of you . Fate fell short this time , your smile fades in the summer , place your hand in mine , I'll leave when I wanna .

\I always thought Armen was a funny name for an Armenian . It's like naming a Scottish kid Scott . \ " Oh < PROPFIRST > ... I wonder what my dad would think about her opinion on his name :P " 
So ignore my last status . That was neither posted by me nor true . 
And I find it kind of funny , I find it kind of sad , the dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had . I find it hard to tell you , I find it hard to take , when people run in circles it's a very very mad world . 
Dear textbook writers , \ 
I'm pretty sure you DIDN'T need to make a new edition of my French textbook . It was published fairly recently . Like really . But because you DID make a new edition , I only got a dollar for selling that book back . ONE DOLLAR . Pristine condition . With the CDs , and the online homework code . That book was perfect . \ 
Screw you , \ 
Dear me , \ 
Remember how you have a 7 am final on Friday ? Yeah , so maybe you should try to go to bed before 2 tomorrow night . \ 
Me . 
< PROPFEMALE > Mardiguian is now a CU graduate ! Congrats ! :D 
Homeeee . And there's snow here ! 
Love is patient , love is kind . It does not envy , it does not boast , it is not proud . It is not rude , it is not self-seeking , it is not easily angered , it keeps no record of wrongs . Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth . It always protects , always trusts , always hopes , always perseveres . Love never fails . 
This week ... my goodness . It's gonna be like the circus fire . 
Hey so I'm gonna need to < PROPFIRST > valve oil from someone sometime soon ... This trumpet is just ... an emergency . 
Am I the only one wishing grades would COME OUT SOONER ?!? 
Made truffles and < PROPFEMALE > mice with the wonderful < PROPFEMALE > Yund yesterday , followed by a viewing of ... the animated Lord of the Rings ... -sob- and then spent part of the night on the roof reading the Hobbit and watching the lunar eclipse :D and then my father informed me that you can see the < PROPFEMALE > from one of our skylights ... convenience . 
My grades . They are online . :DDDDDDD 
Well that was fun , I forgot to do a different thing both times we performed it ... xD Now I know dance moves I will never use again . Woo ! 
Today is going to consist of making cookies , going to Squeak , practicing my trumpet music , wrapping presents , handbell choir practice , handbell quartet practice , choir practice , and then a Christmas party . MY GOODNESS . 
Anybody else pronounced their own last name wrong for 18 years ? No , probably not . I think I should get a prize . 
My bad , Faith Presbyterian is at the corner of < PROPMALE > Park and Circle . Derp . But that doesn't change the fact that there is a Christmas < PROPFEMALE > service at 7 . 
Choereg fresh out of the oven :DDD And as the baker , I feel somewhat justified in stealing one before dinner ... 
Baby monkey ... baby monkey ... 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas < PROPFEMALE > ! Come celebrate at Faith Presbyterian ( corner of < PROPMALE > Park and Circle ) at 7 , preservice music starting at 6:30 :D It's the most wonderful time of the year ... 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone ! :D 
kind of excited about the birthday party for Jesus during church tomorrow :D and for the cake . YES . 
got a nerf gun O.O Now I'm closer to how everyone else was as a child ! Yesss 
Me and my longboard just discovered that Colorado Springs is kind of really hillier than Fort Collins . Also , she would like to register a complaint on behalf of her wheels ... The streets could be a lot smoother . Her wheels are looking a lot more battered than they did yesterday ... 
I've been right , I've been left , I've been wrong , I've been left behind , I've been up but mostly down 
You know , I think there's a reason we never really play board games in my family ... my dad is kind of a beast . Last night . The Nightmare Before Christmas Monopoly . It was ridiculous . 
got the cats some Christmas presents today :D 
Thus far in my reading of LotR , I have found the names Longbottom and Bagshot . Uhm , J.K. Rowling , I love you , but ... 
\There's nothing wrong with being single ! Jesus was single ! \"" 
SNOW :D 
Snow -> awesome . New Year's -> I've got a nerf gun and I'm making a cake . I'm ready to party till 7 am . Better than standing for hours in the Times Square cold and not being able to see the show xD 
Remember how I played Rock Band 3 for the first time yesterday and can play pro keys on expert ? Yeahhhh :D 
And love is a homeless guy searching for treasure in the middle of the rain and finding a bag of gold coins and slowly finding out they're all filled with chocolate and even though he's heart broken , he can't complain because he was hungry in the first place ... 
< PROPFEMALE > Wars marathon = yes . Except the freaky sleep schedule that's gone on lately caught up with me by the last one , so I might've slept through a third of it . But I'd already seen that one , so not too bad . Also , my memory is apparently screwing with me . Woo . 
My mom went out somewhere . I had cake for breakfast . 
Tomorrow : Laundry . Actually make my bed . Put away clothes . Print out this music and work on it so that it'll actually be cool . Continue reading Fellowship . Eclipse Rifftrax night . Yus . 
Today I went to a jazz band practice and saw some people I hadn't seen for a long time , did what my mom would call wasting time ( read some more of FotR , ironic since she's a librarian ... ) , and watched Eclipse Rifftrax and random youtube videos with < PROPFIRST > Souville Baker , < PROPFIRST > Samson , < PROPFIRST > Amoroso , Connor Wood , and < PROPMALE > Wood . It was a pretty good time . 
Yesterday : Visiting some cats . Squeak ( yesss ) . Visiting some Woods ( like < PROPMALE > Wood and Connor Wood ) to watch some movies . American Beauty , Dr. Strangelove , and Kick-Ass . And I enjoyed them all . 
Visited AAHS with < PROPFEMALE > Blanton . Saw some awesome people including < PROPMALE > Leckie , < PROPFIRST > Griner , Garrison Summers , and < PROPMALE > Trujillo , to mention a very few . That joyous time was followed by Qdoba & watching 1000 Ways to Die with 2 of my favorite guys ( Connor Wood and < PROPMALE > Wood ) and 1 of my favorite pups ( < PROPFEMALE > ) . Soon I shall return for some more movie watching fun times . This day is good . 
\Hello ? \ " \ " Hi . \ " \ " Oh . Midnight snack ? \ " \ " ... I just got back . \ " \ " Oh . ... where were you ? \ " \">.< The Woods' ? \ " My dad apparently forgot that I left the house to go and chill with < PROPMALE > Wood and play some L4D2 and watch some Ghostbusters ( the culturing continues ) with the added bonus of going for a ride in a sportscar . Mmyes . How I love winter break . " 
An awesome evening of the first season of Archer with Connor Wood and < PROPFIRST > . < PROPFEMALE > nice . 
Lunch today ... DO YOU LIKE WAFFLES ?!? 
Just watched the Inside Man and Boondock Saints with < PROPFIRST > Souville Baker , Connor Wood , and < PROPMALE > Wood . And had lots of tasty noms to boot . Yus . 
found out that she does indeed remember the password for her Steam account . So hit me up with your username , and mebbe the names of some awesome free games . Cause , uhm , I have other things that I'll need to spend money on in the next seven years besides games , and I also don't have a source of income . So . Free . 
Today : made chereog and watched Good Will Hunting , Hook , and A Clockwork Orange . Yus . 
Help get the Armenian Genocide recognized in the US ! Please call ( 202 ) 225-0100 to ask Speaker Pelosi to schedule a vote on the Armenian Genocide Resolution , HRes252 . We will never forget <3 
Today : About 6 hours of killing zeds on L4D2 with < PROPMALE > Wood and Connor Wood and < PROPMALE > , followed by Zombieland . ... yus . 
National Society of Leadership and Success , you have a new member . Yay and stuff ? 
Dear National Society of Leadership and Success : I know you have a lot of information to share with new members on everything ... but your flashy informational videos make my eyes hurt . 
I've been trying to make some sense out of what you're doing with my head / it's like a skydive , or getting high , the kinda thing'll maybe kill you / it's like I'm eye to eye with a wild lion / oooh , I don't know what to tell you / there's just this thing about you [ I love OK Go ] 
Something strange must be going on with my mind ; lately all my dreams have been extraordinarily violent ... 
Another great day of kitties , L4D2 , Clerks , < PROPFIRST > Souville Baker , < PROPMALE > Wood , and Connor Wood ! :D 
Ah , sushi and teppan for dinner . Om nom noms . After a few hours of shooting zeds with two of my favorite dudes ! < PROPMALE > Wood and Connor Wood , hanging out with you this break has been like having brothers ( without any of the negative things about brothers ) . I'ma miss you guys while I'm at school ! 
Hey peeps . Free tonight ? Hockey ? We have an extra ticket , AF vs Army . Let me know . 
Ah Air Force , we put up a good fight . Great game though . 
\Everybody can be great . Because anybody can serve . You don't have to have a college degree to serve . You don't have to make your subject and your verb agree to serve .... You don't have to know the second theory of thermodynamics in physics to serve . You only need a heart full of grace . A soul generated by love . \ " \ 
I'm excited and vaguely frightened of this semester at the same time . 
Hey all , let me know if you want a copy of my schedule for this semester so you can know when I might kill you if you call because I'm napping after an early class , or when I can shoot zeds with you , or something of the kind . 
The clicker code for my Human and Animal Diseases room is DA . I immediately thought of Dumbledore's Army . 
An hour on the elliptical with some classic rock and Super Mash Bros ... and now I am so ridiculously hungry . OM TO THE NOM NOMS 
Dear computer and internet :\ 
I would just love it if I could start steam in a reasonable amount of time , launch a game in a reasonable amount of time , and if you would not then lag like crazy ... \ 
Like seriously , \ 
A few hours of zed shooting with Connor Wood :D Yeah < PROPMALE > . 8 oclock class ... I'll need a nap tomorrow . Or ... the rec center . Or ... both ? :D 
I was listening to some Bloodhouse Gang and I wondered , \Why is this song called Three Point One Four ? \ " And then I realized : Three Point One Four -> pi -> pie -> < PROPFEMALE > . I lol'd . " 
So I'm packing my bags for the < PROPFEMALE > Mountains , where the spirits go now , over the hills where the spirits fly 
Remember how you were going to get more sleep ? \ 
That means going to sleep earlier too . 
IUD , SIS , stay in school , cause it's the best 
Dear guy whose undies I just handled , \ 
Sorry I had to evacuate your laundry , but I'd already waited for more than half an hour for an open dryer , and I'd already missed out of two dryers because I was too nice to inform the other people that I was also waiting for one . \ 
At least I left it on a dry surface and not the floor . \ 
P.S. The striped pair of kind of a girly shade of green , if no one's told you that . 
If you have gym shorts that no longer fit/you don't wear , you may consider donating them to the < PROPFEMALE > Needs More Gym Shorts Foundation ... I have 3 pairs of gym shorts . Every MWF I go to the rec center , and every TRSu I have Ki-Aikido . This means if I do laundry every other week , each pair of shorts would be worn 4 times before they are washed . So ... if that first statement applies to you , I would love you dearly :D 
Life is kind of really fantastic and beautiful . In case you didn't know . 
I was half an hour late for my first ki-aikido class since I thought it was in the rec center and it turned out to be in a different building , which I then had to find ... Nrrr . 
Dear coordination , \ 
Have you gotten in a fight with my longboard ? You guys really aren't working together . \ 
Sincerely , almost ate it about twenty times today . 
It's super nice out , and it's Thursday . Yus . 
Noo . The Archer premier is during ki aikido .. 
Haha sensei said it was difficult to focus energy through me because of my smile XD Sensei is cool , ki-aikido is pretty awesome , some classes are interesting and others at least aren't horrendous . Life is good . 
I don't know if , as a result of not growing up biking , I don't know how to sit correctly , but I find bike seats extremely uncomfortable . 
The weather in Colorado makes me laugh . Yesterday I was wearing a miniskirt and tank top . Monday and Tuesday it will be snowing . If you don't like the weather ... just wait a while . 
Looking forward to next weekend ! Going back to the Springs to see The Producers at the FAC :D 
I <3 Ki-Aikido . Something I can actually manage to get good at quickly ? What is this ? 2 hours flies past . 
Wow , my alarm completely failed to go off . Thank you Life102 prof for putting slides online ... And it's snowing . Time for a cold trip to the rec center . Luckily it's close or my motivation would be shot xD 
Dear friends , \ 
If you are going to question my decisions , I would prefer you do it before they are in action . That way we can actually have a discussion instead of just a < PROPMALE > for you to be a jerk . Kthxbye . 
talked on the phone with my best friend < PROPFEMALE > Yund for over an hour :D And heard about another hilarious thing my mom said . Laughed so hard I cried . Last time that happened ... I'm pretty sure < PROPMALE > Wood and Connor Wood were pinning me down and tickling me :P Ah , good times , all of them . 
Underarmour - useful for skiing , marching band , and walking to class in negative temperatures . 
I want to go to Ki-Aikido tonight .... but I don't want to walk to the other end of campus at night in negative degrees . Hurrrr . 
Mother of God that wind is killer . Yeah , not walking in that to get to Ki-Aikido . That is not happening tonight . 
Hopefully my alarm actually goes off tomorrow , otherwise my phone and I are going to be sitting down to a serious discussion about this problem . Sleeping through my 8 oclock messes up my workout schedule >.< 
It's cold enough that as I walked back from my class ( which was cancelled because my prof is sick -_-) my breath condensed on my hair so it was literally tipped with ice . Not gonna lie , it was pretty cool . 
Worked out to the tempo of Flogging < PROPFEMALE > today . My iPod decided to give me the fastest songs . My heart rate was chilling around 200 . I see a myocardial infarction in my future if I keep this up ... 
' I looked out to see the < PROPFEMALE >,' said Aragorn . ' What of the < PROPFEMALE >?' they jeered . ' We are the Uruk-hai : we do not stop the fight for night or day , for fair weather or for storm . We come to kill , by sun or < PROPFEMALE > . What of the < PROPFEMALE >?' ' None knows what the new day shall bring him , ' said Aragorn . 
\Omego 3 fatty acids are good for your heart ! \ " I kind of want to play < PROPMALE > Wake just to hear more ridiculous quotes from the Taken . \ " Chainsaws are loud ! \"" 
I just found the site www.ohmythatsawesome.com ... great . Cause I needed another way to spend obscene amounts of time on the computer > < 
... wait . Microsoft Word . You know the word \elephantiasis\ " . Cool . But ... you don't know the word \ " protists\ " ? ... I don't even know what to say ... " 
Way too easily distracted ... I should be studying chemistry , but instead I've been watching youtube videos and reading The Two Towers and practicing my rolls ... Trying to fix my forward roll XD Dorm rooms are not the best environment for practicing aikido . 
Tap on my window , knock on my door , I , wanna make you feel beautiful 
New shoes , gym shorts , shirt , yarn , LOTS of new socks . Then an afternoon full of Connor Wood , followed by the Producers ! My mom said I should wear boots . I am too classy to wear boots to the theatre ( obviously ) . Which meant that I got to slide down the sidewalk to the car . Yeahhhhhh . Somebody said , \and ... it's SAFE ! \ " as I slid . I'm glad somebody else enjoyed my ice shenanigans as much as I did . :D " 
Realized on my way to aikido that I'm wearing men's pants , men's shorts , and a boy's hoodie . And my shoes and shirt are asexual . Somehow my mind went to Old Spice : \The chick your man could be . \ " Dear brain : Lolwut ? " 
R.I.P. < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ; the world of Redwall was a wonderful escape . 
Do you brighten a room when you enter , or when you leave ? 
< PROPFEMALE > DVX better be damn good champagne or I'll feel like The Lonely Island has broken my trust and lied to me through song . Just sayin . 
Considering auditioning for a band looking for a female singer ... Hmm hmm hmm . And subbing for the Northern Colorado handbell festival .... So much to dooooo 
This morning I got cookies for knowing that Short Skirt/Long Jacket is by Cake and I bought two new calligraphy inks . I'd say that's a good start to the day . 
What game am I playing right now ? Cat Planet . 
CAT PLANET CAT PLANET CAT PLANET CAT PLANET CAT PLANET CAT PLANET CAT PLANET CAT PLANET CAT PLANET CAT PLANET CAT PLANET CAT PLANET CAT PLANET CAT PLANET CAT PLANET CAT PLANET CAT PLANET CAT PLANET 
Note to self :\ 
Yes , LIFE102 is basically a review of AP bio . Yes , an 8 o'clock class is early . Yes , all the slides are online . But you should still probably try a little harder to go to class .... 
Oh man , I need to make a playlist for the bathroom instead of just shuffling my top rated .... Sorry girls on my floor , I know you are probably not Disturbed fans and that the switch to Sweeney < PROPMALE > directly following it probably gave you music mood whiplash . 
It is a good day for getting a lot of sleep , wearing new shoes , longboarding on the melting snow , understanding chemistry , free cupcakes , and talking about band . Also : Kill < PROPMALE > weekend , methinks . Yus . 
Ohai guys , I got Skype . Just btdubs . 
Roses are red , \ 
Violets are blue . \ 
I have a gun . \ 
Get in the < PROPFIRST > . 
Is anyone in the northern Colorado-ish area gong down to the Colorado Springs-ish area for Easter ? I know it's still a ways off ... 
Well my goal for this week was to write and send two letters ... but I already did that . Additional goal for this week : Beat the flash version of Portal . 
I'm eating at all the hobbit meal times today . I already had breakfast , second breakfast , and elevensies , and I'm currently finishing up luncheon . Yes , I'm having luncheon instead of going to chemistry . ... don't judge me ... 
If you're in Colorado Springs Saturday , you should definitely go to the Southern Colorado Handbell Festival :D It's at 7 pm at the city auditorium ( 221 E . Kiowa ) . It's < PROPFEMALE > cool ; more than 30 handbell choirs all playing together is some awesome times . Also , there will be a < PROPFEMALE > there , so who'd want to miss that ? 
Hey you . YES YOU . Are you in Colorado Springs ? Tonight . City auditorium . 7 . It'll be awesome . BE THERE . 
Hundreds of bells + brass instruments = a fantastic thing . 
Being a festival orphan -> kind of some of the most difficult sightreading you will ever do in your life . \ 
GOODNESS . 
Gah . Laziness . You've been here for two weeks . GEDOUTTAHERE . 
Goal for this week : Don't skip anything . Work on resume/cover letters for vets this summer . 
\I need a blow up doll . \ " \ " Woah . Direct . \"" 
Hmm ...... preorder Portal 2 for $45 and get a free copy of Portal .... \ 
Tempting . 
Alright , I saw something about Zombie Mondays at the rec center . Does anyone know what this is about ? Because I am imagining AWESOME things going down at the rec center on Monday , and I'm hoping I'm right . Related note : Anybody know about anything HvZ related this semester ? Cause now I actually have a nerf gun ... and it's not reaching its potential sitting in my closet . 
Hmm .... which solo to play , which solo to play ... 
CSU's internet services are not conducive to me playing L4D2 with Connor Wood and < PROPMALE > Nichols . DAMN AND BLAST . 
I wasn't doing well with my goals for this week . So I discarded them and made new ones : Pre-order Portal 2 and make a snow angel . By these standards , my week was a success . 
Started watching Mission Impossible yesterday , but fell asleep before any actual movie happened .... then finished Firefly , ran around Toys R Us and Target , bought Firefly and ammo for my nerf gun , and watched Kill < PROPMALE > Part 1 . \ 
And we danced . And we cried . And we laughed . And had a really really really good time . 
Oh my dear Lord , System is coming to < PROPMALE > May 18th . IAMSOEXCITED . Now . Who's going with me ? 
I really did intend to go to aikido tonight , but instead I fell asleep while reading my pathology textbook ... for 2 1/2 hours ... and as a result slept through dinner , a floor meeting , and the first half hour of aikido . I ... think I need more sleep at night ... 
Day one of biphasic sleeping ! Actually I'm not sure if it counts as biphasic if one of the phases isn't a complete cycle ... In any case , I'm excited to see how this goes . \ 
Also : HvZ tomorrow :DDDDD 
So . SoaD tickets go on sale tomorrow for May 18th in < PROPMALE > . If you live in Colorado Springs and like SoaD ( I know this category includes < PROPFIRST > Samson , < PROPMALE > Nichols , and < PROPFIRST > Griner ; facebook tells me so ) , and you'd like to go to the concert ( cause who can say when this'll happen again ? ) hit me up . And that way I won't have to go by myself >.< 
Well that was enough workout for a few days ... You guys know the first rule of zombies : Cardio . \ 
That was a damn good time . 
Legitimately thought that I woke up from my core , not my nap >.< < PROPFEMALE > is in zombie mode : What do I want ? TEAAAAAAA 
Ah < PROPFEMALE > Garden . I am so full of delicious . It is joyful . I am reading about PNEUMONIA for an exam tomorrow and the joyfulness still wins . Also : it's almost spring break . Pretty much what I'm saying is if you come to my room between now and 1 am , I will be awake , I will be joyful , and you will get a hug . 
Man , I think I had a one or two week period going there of not making myself bleed .... Damn . 
I play Russian roulette every day , a man's sport , with a bullet called life , yeah mama called life 
Someone cried because of how beautiful the music was in church today . This is why I love performing music . It's amazing how you can evoke emotions by moving air through vocal cords or hitting rubber on metal . 
Dear police officer , if your intent was to ruin a perfectly good day , and possibly week , you have succeeded . 
Lamb , pilaf , and choereg . How very ... Armenian of me . If only I'd also had some lahmajoon . 
Yesterday was Thursday , Thursday . Today it is Friday , Friday . We we we so excited . 
First class after spring break included Vampire Weekend , OK Go's music video for This Too Shall Pass , and Big Bang Theory . ... I'd say that's a pretty good start for the rest of the semester . 
Sorry movie reviewers , I enjoyed Sucker Punch no matter what you say . 
I like the snow . I like aikido . But yeah , not going to aikido if it means walking or boarding into snow . 
I am interested in far more classes than I will have time to take in the next three years ...

Dear Cracked.com,\ 
No , really , I have an exam in less than two hours , so I should probably spend a little time looking over my not- 13 Things You Won't Believe Are Against the Law Somewhere ? Challenge accepted . 
Now think of all the years you tried to find someone to satisfy you , I might be as crazy as you say . If I'm crazy then it's true , that it's all because of you , and you wouldn't want me any other way . 
An hour of playing with puppies , followed by UP and The Emperor's New Groove with < PROPMALE > Ybarra , < PROPMALE > Rivero , and < PROPFIRST > Souville Baker . Yeah , I'd call that a good Thursday night . 
I do believe I'm going to dye my hair again . Maybe in the fall . I'm thinking Manic Panic's Atomic Turquoise . AND . AND . Not only is it turquoise . It is blacklight reactive . Yeahhhh .

Dear mammalian stress response , \

The Axis of Awesome was ... AWESOME . Now you know , how to kill a hooker .
