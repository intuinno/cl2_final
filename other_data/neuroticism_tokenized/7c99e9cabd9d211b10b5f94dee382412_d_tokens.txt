on my way home from Idaho . Had fun with family and some old friends we ran into . Can't wait to be in my own bed ! I'm soooo tired ! 
I want my bed !!!!!!!!! :( 
so nice to see familiar surroundings . 
My big boys just left for the week .... off to Desolation Wilderness in Tahoe for a backpacking trip :( . I miss ' em already ! 
Has anyone seen motivation around ? 
My boys are out having fun in the storms passing over South Lake Tahoe , on their backpacking trip . Hail , lots of rain and lots of thunder . CRAZY !!!! An experience I'm sure they'll never forget . 
My boys came home a day early ! Yeah !!!!! I'm so excited to have them home ... and in one piece . 
My 12 year old cleaned my kitchen and all chairs without being told a couple days ago , and today my 11 year old is doing laundry for me ... washing , drying and folding without being asked ! What the heck has gotten into them ?! I like it !!!! 
Just finished packing everything up for girls camp in the morning . I hope I got everything ! Looking forward to a week full of fun ... but will miss my kids and hubby . :( Will bring back lots of pictures . Time for a little shut eye before I leave at 7 a.m. 
Ahhh .... Home from girls camp at last ! I'm thankful for my shower and my bed , and my family . It's great to be home !

Cookies , ice cram , brownies , cookies , ice cream brownies .... what to eat , what to eat ?!?! 
Made a yummy pot of spaghetti and meatballs for dinner along with salad , nice cold watermelon , and fresh squash from our garden . Mmmmm ... still trying to let it all digest . Need to make some room for whatever I find for dessert . :) Wonderful dinner with my family , minus 1 . I even got a nap in today !

Wondering where my vb girls were today ?!? Only 5 of us today . Less girls = more drills = more PAIN !!! Please come tomorrow !!!!!! 
Headed to the new Sonic on Mission in Hayward for dinner with my hubby just to find it was PACKED ... so we then proceeded to go to Union Landing to find somewhere to eat ... everything PACKED .... then end up driving past my house , where we started , and on to find a place in Fremont to eat at the Market Broiler . Lots of driving ! Good thing I was in good company ! :) 
is ready for a nap ! Better get busy with the day before I fall asleep . :o Happy Monday ! Yawwwwwwwwwn ...... 
Wake up , wake up , WAAAAKKKKE UUUUUUUUUUUUPPPPPP !!!!!!!! 
Just when I thought I'd failed as a mother .... I get home from a date with my hubby , son , and his girlfriend ... to find that my wonderful 13 year old daughter had cleaned up the house , made sure my 3 youngest took their showers , and organized ALL the shoes that had been thrown into our entry closet . Ahhhhhhhh .... nothing makes a mommy happier ! :) 
Happy Birthday to my sweet little Lizzy who is 8 today ! I am taking her and a friend to see a movie and out to lunch in this wonderful rainy weather . Happy birthday baby girl ! 
think I'm going to have ice cream for lunch today . I don't care how cold or rainy it is . Maybe I'll add some hot chocolate to the menu to help keep me warm in between bites . :) 
My son < PROPFIRST > is on his way to camp in the snow tonight ... and as I am teaching piano ... he informs me that as they are driving to their destination they are in blizzard conditions . Not something you tell your mother !!!! Hope they make it through the night okay ! 
Waiting for my 2 oldest to get home from their snow trip . 
Already put in 6 hours today ... and my day is FAR from over . Sitting down for a little lunch before I get back to work . 
Just noticed the blossoms on the trees . So beautiful ! 
What a great day so far . Kids are ready for school a half an hour early and beds are made ... well at least the girls beds are made ... and mine . Guess it does make a difference when we get up earlier rather than a half hour before they are supposed to be walking out the door . lol 
Make it a glass half full kinda day :) . Happy Monday ! 
Trying to eat healthy . IT'S SOOOOO HARD THOUGH !!!!! Everything I think of to eat quickly is filled with junk or something I'm trying to avoid . Dang it !!!! 
Getting ready for my sweet little Lizzy's baptism today ! Been a busy morning . 
So glad today is over .... or now it would be yesterday . Had Lizzy's baptism ... and spoke at the adult session of Stake Conference . Very busy day ! Think it's time to get a little sleep ! 
My oldest was in a car accident this morning on his way to school with his friends . They all are doing fine . A little shaken up , but all in all doing okay . Glad to know they were protected from any < PROPMALE > harm .

Went to DMV today .... and while I was standing in front of the lady that was supposed to be helping me register our truck .... she was texting someone and carrying on a conversation with the lady next to her and takin ' her sweet time getting my stuff done ! Where DO these people come from ?!?! 
Our house is now on the market . 
To ALL my v ball girls ...... I better not be the ONLY one that shows up tomorrow . Getting my butt kicked by < PROPFIRST > last week was enough to last me for the year ! lol But thanks < PROPFIRST > for the great work out ! 
Almost finished with school for the year . Waiting to pick up my LAST kindergartner at 3 . 
1st day of our summer vacation and I have 2 little ones laying next to me in my bed ! I woke up at 5:45 and they joined me at around 6:30 . Can we switch our summer vacation over to the winter time when everyone sleeps in ?!? Love those DARK mornings ! :)

Had a fun day today surprising my mom for her 70th birthday by taking her out to lunch along with my sister . 
Got some sit ups and push ups in this morning , along with a 2 mile run and a 2 hour workout at v ball . Lets see if I can find the energy to make it through the rest of my day now . 
I'm down to 3 kids . Now .... how to get rid of the rest of them ?! :)

Going to an A's game tonight with my hubby . Can't wait ! 
I am in need of a new brain ! Mine doesn't want to work for me any more . 
Wishing my baby boy a very happy 17th birthday today ! : ) Had fun last night rearranging bedrooms so we could surprise him with his own room for his birthday . Surprise accomplished . My hubby and I had less than 2 hours to pull off the surprise . No more guest room now . 
Went camping this weekend with my wonderful family . Had lots of fun !! Now I'm beat ! Kids mad lots of friends and had fun . Food all turned out great too . Hope I can get the smell of smoke off of me now . : ) Gotta love camping ! Can't wait to sleep in my bed though ! 
Come ooooooooooonnnnn Wednesday !!! : ) 
Had a nice 5 1/2 mile jog/power walk/walk this morning listening to the mo tab . Very relaxing . 
I went back in time today . I had a diaper bag and two little ones with me while going to a doctor appt . , and had to try to keep them entertained while I filled out some paper work . It was actually quite entertaining to everyone in the waiting room . : ) CRAZY ! It almost felt as if I had never done that before . 
I REALLY want a 5 guys burger right now !!! Been craving one ever since I had one a couple of weeks ago . 
The more you have to do .... the more you get done . At least that's how it works for me . When I have too much time on my hands I tend to procrastinate . Been a great day ! 
It was SOOOO nice waking up after the sun this morning !!! 
It is sooo NOT fun getting up at 5 a.m after going to bed at MIDNIGHT !!! UHHG !! Gonna be a VERY long day . : O 
Made it through my day without collapsing . FEW !!! Thank goodness for my magic drink that gave me the boost I needed ! : ) 
ALRIGHT ..... who STOLE Fall ?!?! Seriously !!! I want it BACK !! 
Had a great day with my sweetheart . Love it when I get to enjoy my Saturday . 
I have the most AMAZING husband in the whole world ! If you don't believe me ... just check out the video he made that's on my wall . Made me cry . 
Way to go GIANTS !!!!! WOO HOO !!! 
Wishing the love of my life a very Happy Anniversary !! It's been a crazy ride ... but I wouldn't change having you by my side through it all for anything . 
Practice , practice , practice and moooooooore .............. practice ! I think my arms are gonna fall off . I am glad I have something to work towards though . Gotta love the Christmas season . 
Happy Thanksgiving !! May you all have a blessed and safe day ! Enjoy your family and friends and give thanks to God for all you have . 
Had a fun date with my boys ! Froze a bit at the < PROPMALE > football game and then went to get some yummy Chicago style pizza . 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone ! Man .... it is sooo not a good idea to have a family dinner Christmas < PROPFEMALE > when you still have presents to wrap . Up until 4 with my hubby watching movies and eating ice cream while wrapping . Good times ! 
Ummmm .... it is still Winter .... right ? Cuz my AC just went on ! 
Such a great day ! Got so much done today ... thanks to my hubby and my wonderful children . They all helped mom get the house clean ! Yay !! 
My conversation with my 7 year old tonight at 8 . Me : time for bed . Payson : awwww ... but it's Friday night . Me : so what time do you think you should go to bed then ? Payson : 10 . I think he'd stay up all night playing xbox if I'd let him . I've been ready for bed since 7 . Anyone want him ?! ; ) 
listening to my 2 youngest talking to each other or 1 is humming while the other is making sword fighting noises when they are supposed to be going to sleep . It is so funny ! We tell them to stop talking and go to sleep ... but that lasts about 1 minute and then they start talking again . This goes on for about an hour . : ) 
Scary ! There was a tornado warning just issued in San Mateo County ! 
Enjoying my day off . Soooo quiet ! Love it ! Now ... I should probably get something done that I can't do when I'm at work . Nap ? Clean floors ? Clean out fridge ? Go pick up something for lunch ? Hmmmm ..... maybe I'll just sit here and meditate ? So many choices I don't know what to do and the day is going by soooo fast ! : ) 
Either school work is getting harder at a younger age .... or I'm getting dumber ! I used to feel confident about helping my kids up until at least 5th grad ( sad I know ) .... but now I'm questioning my ability while helping my 3rd grader ! : ) Think I need to go back to school !!!
