Finally Summer :p 

is at Gideon's figuring out FB 
Tired of getting everyones attention except the person's you want . Wish life was easy . 
Putting someones happiness above your own . Trying to make them happy at the cost of your own . I only say i'm stupid cause i want to do it , not because i do . 
Don't relize how much you depend on someone until they are gone , I thought i liked having < PROPFEMALE > around , then she left . Now i realize I need her around . Miss you < PROPFEMALE > , hurry up and visit . 
For the first time in a long time , I am terrified of what is going to happen . I already hurt from something that hasn't even happened yet , and it's killing me . 
Don't know what I'm even hoping for anymore . That's a lie , I know exactly what i'm hoping for . Don't know why I'm stupid enough to keep hoping for it . 
In the < PROPFEMALE > city for a weekend with my dad and little bro . Litterally my brother from another mother . 
has returned . 
confloundered : a confused fish 
I don't like you cause you treat me like shit , I like you despite that you treat me like shit . 
I hate my addiction but love what I'm addicted to . No wonder people never get better . 
New Title : Dance Master of Dimension X , if you'd please now refer to me as such . 
< PROPFIRST > Chami is the coolest person ever . Yup .
