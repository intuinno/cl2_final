I have a bottle of Phillips Root 100 for tonights festivities and am planning to find the bottom of it ! 
I'm hoping someone will be around to hold my beard back if I throw up tonight lol 
I have started a cause and hope people join . 
I find it hard to tell what's on my mind ; due to the fact that I can't see the top of my brain without removing my skull . 
Please put this on your status if you know someone ( related to someone ) who has been eaten by a dragon . Dragons are nearly unstoppable and in case you didn't know , they can breathe fire . 93% of people won't copy & paste this because they have been eaten by dragons . The other 7% of ... people are sitting in the shower armed with fire extinguishers .

It's said that everlasting friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question their friendship . These types of friends pick up like they spoke just yesterday , regardless of how long it has been or how far away they live . And they dont ' hold grudges . They understand that life is busy , but you will always love them ... Re-post if you have at least 1 of these friends
