I have a personal reason for ASKING if everyone could please put this as their status for 1 hour . I know the ones that will . Think of someone you know or love who has had cancer . My wish is that in 2011 a cure will be found . Will you post it for 1 hour ? Do it for all who have fought and are fighting . I hope to see this in the status of all my friends 
I really wish that people would stick to their word ...... 
time to stop getting excited about things and getting my hopes up for plans to actually work out ..... they neverwork out ... 
Everything about you makes me smile !! <3 
i have to vacum out my moms freaking car . JOY .... 
I hate mornings and u gettin mad at me doesn't help my mood . 
why cant you try to understand the situation instead of ignoring it .?? 
ok time to update my playlist . any ideas ??? old or new songs ! 
My wish , for you , is that this life becomes all that you want it to , \ 
Your dreams stay big , and your worries stay small , \ 
You never need to < PROPFEMALE > more than you can hold , \ 
And while you're out there getting where you're getting to , \ 
I hope you know somebody loves you , and wants the same things too , \ 
Yeah , this , is my wish . 
I feel like < PROPMALE > !!! 
wow i freakin suck track .. no joke .. haha 
Let's be clear on this : OBAMA did NOT kill Bin Laden . An American soldier , who Obama just a few weeks ago was debating on whether or not to PAY , did .

While you scream at your woman , there's a man wishing he could whisper in her ear . While you humiliate , offend , and insult her , there's a man wanting to remind her how beautiful she is . While you hurt her , there's a man wishing he could take her pain away . While you make her cry , there's a man wanting to see smiles from her .... Please repost this if you are against domestic violence and mental abuse 
People can change and when they change for the better you should support them ! Help them continue to do better , if you disconect yourself from them or tease them for it what good does that do ?!
