HAPPY NEW YEAR to all my family and friends here !!!!! i am soooooo glad 2009 is over , there was more rotten than good this year for me and looking forward to a brand new year . 

it is a good thing i have the day off after i deliver this load in the morning because i cant get to sleep !!! i go across the street at 6am to get checked in then i can go to bed for awhile . 
i wish everyone a happy and prosperous new year ! i am going to try and get to sleep without tearing the sheets off the bed . 
I enjoyed seeing all of you the last couple of nights ! To those of you that travelled from far away - Don't fly faster than your angels can fly when you head for home !! To those who didn't make it to the reunion , hopefully you can make it to the next one ! 
I finally made it to the beach this week . I went to treasure island for the afternoon while the air conditioning was fixed on the truck . My friend \Fruitloop\ " yelled at me for swimming out so far . " 
my body is ready to finally relax for the night . I have finally reunited my youngest son with his other grandma after 19 yrs or so . thanks to all the drummers sitting close to us to help keep meee caalllmmm 
i can't remember how to invite someone in here , what a lazy day it has been . no wonder my brain ain't working . I am in < PROPFEMALE > , ks and supposed to be in north platte , ne by 2am . tuesday . gee i think i ought to have dispatch reschedule this load of bananas !! lmao . i don't think i am going to make delivery on time what do you think ? lol

5am and cant get to seep My trailer was broken into tonight while i was sleepig earlier , thank god they didn't run off with any cases of monkey pickles !! i have already had to pay for 30 cases that were crushed & refused . that came out of my pocket even though there is insurance it is starting to get nasty out here and i am thinking that working at the meat packing house is starting to sound aawfully good real soon . 
< PROPFEMALE > i don't know where you got all your farmville dollars too get that balloon but it looks awesome . i am hoping to be able to expand my farm here real soon

i got a new truck today . i have never been a volvo kind of girl because volvo's are for sissies and there ain't no sissy in this little girl . i went from less storage than my columbia to even less storage than the volvo . by god i better still get my fuel bonus or i am done . i will go buy my own truck then . 
here i sit at another walmart . can't be late with that walmart frieght but it takes them an hour to check you in at the gate and another hour at the traffice control window and your only allowed on the property one hour before your appointment time . go figure . 
Wooo Hooo I think I am finally getting all the carbon monoxide out of my blood stream , I am only sleeping 8hrs now instead of 12-14hrs . On my way back to Iowa with a load of simply orange juice for Hy-Vee . Ya all have a good day :) 
10-4 on the don't be late with the o.j. lol my appt . isn't until noon tomorrow and I will be there when I go to bed tonight . I can't stand being late and we have a boat load of drivers that are late with this contract . I guess that is why our customer service people have me back on the contract , I am only late when my truck breaks down . 
Even when I had exhaust fumes coming in the cab I didn't run late . I got sick but still delivered on time . Is that dedication or what ? :) Time to go eat so I can get across the land of stinkin < PROPMALE > and the misery state then it is home turf - the corn fields here I come . 
what a loonnnggg day - slept on my couch last night . Haven't seen the house since 9/4 . Had breakfast with my son < PROPFIRST > and went christmas shopping for a bit . god i love kohl's!!! Now i am at the ky/tn line , got to be in miami 6am sunday . nite nite 
88 degrees in miami tonight wooo hooo

anyone know how we put in a friends request ??? i haven't figured that out yet 
ooohhh i think i figured it out yippie 
i finally made it out of florida tonight . Now I am going to the top side of Baltimore . < PROPFEMALE > haw . it isn't so bad there , i will be on familar turf and have lots of protection if i need it . I spent almost 3 yrs . running nothing but east coast , so I have lots of friends there . I hope to be having dinner with my friend hammer when i get there wednesday . 
sure would be nice if campers and pickups parked where they are supposed at the rest areas !!! I am stuck listening to traffice buzz by my head . isn't like I can legally drive any further up the road with all them solar panelled truck drivers filling up the truck stops b4 dark . I would like to put nails in front of the tires on the campers !!!!!!!!! nite nite y'all don't let the bed bugs bite 
80 degrees in southern south < PROPFEMALE > at noon today and this man is wearing a stocking cap - unreal . finally cooler temperatures . I am getting closer to you April , but I am stopping just before the Delaware line . 
nite nite ya'all sweat dreams everyone 
I almost wish I could afford to run over my phone . It has not shut up in three days . I'm gonna shut it off for the night and work on mastering \QUICKEN\ " one of these days I will get it figured out . farm chores are done for a few hours . " 
I don't know I have been so tired this week but I am worn out . Another good nights sleep and I should back to normal tomorrow . Congrats to my son < PROPFIRST > on the new job , now get your head out of Jamies ass so you can see what lies in front of you - when you become unemployed again , she will kick you out a third time - repeat of history is very hard to stop . love ya all night night sweet dreams 
I hear it is snowing back home . It rained off and on all night here in Carlisle , < PROPFEMALE > . My chores on done on the farms , now it is time for the rainlocker and some foooddd . Have a good day everyone !!!!! 
I hope everyone had a good day today !! I had a very busy day , a little over 700 < PROPMALE > for the day in a 65mph truck pulling a heavy load of hams thru the mountains of southern WV and over to the shipyards in Norfolk , VA which is where I sit for my 10hr break . I am glad I am addicted to farmville , I can wind down from the road 
It is a beautiful day in the neighborhood here at the navy shipyard in norfolk , va . We must have a holding tank in albania for our military food supply because that is where my load of hams are going . Eat up troops , the hams are here 
I thought I was doing a good job with my trip planning until someone made a mistake and hit a parked big truck sleeping on the ramp going into a rest area and pushed that one into a car hauler . God please be with that driver's family when they get the call in the morning that their loved one was killed while sleeping . 
I had forgotten how humid it is in florida this time of year , it felt like 90 but was only 78 ?. that darned ol pinched nerve in my neck that I have been fighting for how long now is giving me fits again along with spasms in my back . I hope the 28th of october hurry ups and gets here so I can go home and see my chiropractor . I'm going to have him take me off work a few extra days too . 
i am sooooo looking forward to going home !!!!!!! I need my back worked on and it is impossible to walk into the chiro's office while out on the road and not pay them $250-300 . there is no such thing as the gonstadt method anymore unless you go back to davenport . i wonder is < PROPFEMALE > will let < PROPFEMALE > come play with grandma for an afternoon ?? 
joshua -- answer your phone !!!!! this satelite tv thing on my truck is driving me NUTTTTSSSSS . thats what i get for going the $20 route versus the $700+ route 
direct tv says no tv because my steel pole is not direct tv steel . a pole is a pole is it not ???????? talk about frustration no football , no CSI , all I have is my trusty ole keyboard :( 
ooohhh it is going to be a long day tommorrow - the pain pill didn't knock me out like it was supposed to . nite nite sweet dreams everyone 
good morning everyone !!!! i don't believe its a monday and i am up an hour before my alarm went off . i am not a morning person and for me to be up so early is unreal . at least the tramadol worked for the pain in my neck and my migraine . it didn't put me to sleep but it took away the pain momentarily . mcd's for breakfast it is . have a good day :) 
Good Morning < PROPFEMALE > 
Now I am really scarred - I just got my 401k plan started . I don't know anything about that shit but I do know I need a savings plan of some sort so I went the conservative way 
thanks for the bear < PROPFEMALE > !!! I love it 
a very lazy day it is here in sunshinny indiana . I deliver in Indy tonight , reload in Ft . < PROPMALE > and then off to the sunshine state again . I'm getting close to my scheduled hometime so will probably bring another load of juice back to Hy-Vee . You keep buying minute maid/siimply oj products and I will keep the warehouse stocked up . 
nite nite everyone . it has been a long day but i got er done i even delivered 4 hrs early . 
Good Morning or shall I say Good Afternoon everyone . I am headed north today and will TRY to bring some of the sunshine and warmth from floriday with me . Have a good day !!! 
if you find the web < PROPFEMALE > for farmville secrets - don't throw away your money like i just did . so far it is a scam . if someone else has been able to get the download , please let me know how you did it . 
Good Night everyone . I am going to bed and then delivering this load of fish guts to be made into cat food and going home to a LOOOONNNNGGGGG ISLAND ICE TEA . 
Good Morning everyone I hope everyone has a good day !!! I am in waterloo at < PROPMALE > and becci's for the moment , stayed the night and headed home here in a minute or two . Darn license plates are fixin to expire on me so got to get to the court house today . Don't drive faster than your angels can fly !!!!! 
< PROPFIRST > , I hope you make it into bed somewhere and you better have all your clothes on in the morning , or shall I say when you wake up somtime this afternoon . I hope you had a memboral 21st !!!!! My 21st birthday , I celebrated at the first Farm Aid concert in Champaign , IL and thought I was going to faint when < PROPFIRST > Cash came out on stage . Mama and Jesus will always love you kid . 
chili simmering in the crock pot would smell soooo goooodd right now , no tomato juice or tomatoes . I really don't want to go into town again . 
I can't believe I have only 1 day left at home to relax . Another case of \no rest for the wicked\ " because I won't relax now until tomorrow night . Too much for one person to get done . At times I wish I had me a good wife at home to take care of so much of this heavy chores lmao " 
hey am i the only one that can not get into farmville ????? 
Ooh my goodniss Is this Monday ?? or friday the 13th . I am glad the day is almost over !! What is the deal with farmville ?? I can't get into to do chores - not that I have the time right now -- I still can't go to bed with out climbing over ... everything ; but my relief driver decided he didn't need to follow dispatch orders I hope everyone else had a wonderful tuesday !! Good night 
How do i pitch a bitcch with facebook/farmville ??? I still can't do my chores - it has been since last sunday and i can't get in 
I am calling it a day and only worked about 5 hrs . These migrains have got to go find someone to bother because I am about fed up with them !!!! I bet I end up having another mri done , for now I hide from the < PROPFEMALE > because they will disqualify me from working and no disability pay 
Good Morning everyone - I don't know why I am awake this early , I didn't get to sleep til almost 3am . 500 < PROPMALE > to drive today , but I am going back to sleep for a bit . Have a good day everyone 
I hope everyone had a good day today ! I was finally able to get a good nights sleep got up early and went back to bed till noon . hehe . No headache today til about an hour ago , probably from frustration from dealing with a male night dispatcher whom didn't have time for a woman's new truck breaking down because he \had a man on the other line\ " . huh wait till the morning when the owner is in the office !!! " 
i got to love these yo-yo's i work for - they insist 100% compliance with the < PROPFEMALE > but they schedule the loads so tight that they don't allow for time for a flat tire or in today's case replacing a mudflap that < PROPMALE > meat tore off when they spotted my trailer . now i can't deliver to wal-mart on time legally . guess what - they have to relay it . 
THE THOUGHT FOR THE DAY ---- have you women ever thought about how you are dressed when you are in your car and passing a semi !!!!!!! especially in a traffic jam , trust me - i listen to it all the time on my cb . have you ever thought about how your seatbelt crosses between your boobs ? think about it 
the weekend was long but the bs today was just as bad . when you want something done you better do it yourself because the \men\ " refuse to . I won't tolerate the sexest shit without loosing my top and I raised the roof today 1200 < PROPMALE > away . I hope < PROPMALE > gets here in the morning with his motorcycle !!!! I refuse to work tomorrow . " 
rain rain go away , come again someother day , you can rain up north and you can rain west of birmingham but dont you dare blow towards jacksonville !!!!!!! i need to have my knees in the breeze and the wind in my face !!!! 
finally i get a break . its a crying shame i still can't get satelite tv to work on this darn truck . oh well , i guess i clean this pig sty up a bit and play on my computer all day 
I do believe I have just come as close as I care to having a heartache !!! OMG I am ever so grateful that I was able to get my truck off the road and parked , I am feeling a little bit better now than I did an hour ago - dam chicken fat anyway . I had hot wings for dinner in louisiana earlier , i love chicken but why is it that everytime i eat chicken it is full of fat . 
good night ya all i have my farm chores done and all my fish tanks cleaned and fish are fed . now it is time for me to get some sleep . i am feeling much better now than i was when i parked this big rig , thank god for being there for me when i need him !!!! i love ya all sweet dreams 
good morning everyone it is a beautiful day in the neighborhood ! 70degress or so , partly cloudy . looks like i get to enjoy the whole day in texas . i wonder is my good friend < PROPFIRST > tidalgo can come out and play lmao . 
it is now time for me to go to work . i hope everyone of you have a wonderful day !!! god speed good friends

I want to take a moment and wish all my friends and family a very happy and safe thanksgiving day ! PLEASE someone eat some turkey and pumpkin pie for me , i refuse to eat truck stop thanksgiving dinner due to the fact everyone is cutting back on the quality of the food nowadays . I hope mom and < PROPFIRST > freeze me a plate !!!!! 
I have many things to be thankful for this year and one of them is ms. < PROPFEMALE > - the dammest thing though , she is not going to be able to win this battle against the infection in her body if she doesn't get some very much needed REST and that doesn't mean all the excitement of someone coming to visit her , that is doing more harm than good . I pray that Jesus will wrap his arms around her and keep her warm tonight 
I FINALLY had had enough tonight and went to the ER in north platte , ne . NEVER again will i go to this hospital !!!!! The ER nurse HATES truck drivers . I have vertigo , CT was normal . off work till released by family physician . now how do i get home-i am not allowed to drive . that is why we don't go to ER out on the road . 
i am finally home , what a long day . blood pressure last night at the er was 169/107 , what do you think april ? do i need to rest a bit ? 
good afternoon everyone --- my head is off kilter today and balance is waaayyyy off so will spend the day on the couch now that i made it home-no thanks to dispatch .

I have finally finished my very short version of my autobiography , i am proud of myself and yet disappointed - not in my writing abilities but in another area of life . How can one person succeed in life but yet feel like a total failure in everything they set out to do ? Because she refuses to do it for herself !!!!!! she feels that it must be done for someone else and that is not worthy of having it alone 
Shame on you America : the only country where we have homeless without shelter , children going to bed without eating , elderly going without needed meds , and mentally ill without treatment , VETERANS that recieve no help when they need it . - yet we have a benefit for the people of Haiti on 12 TV stations . 99% of people won't have the guts to copy and repost this .... 
why is it when the men that refuse to ever trust a woman again , they continue to \hook up\ " with women so that they can still get laid ? no wonder i am stuck in a rutt with only \ " playmates\ " and batteries . at least i know i am not getting something ajax wont wash off " 
now i think i understand why i felt it necessary for me to go back to school - so that i had a legit excuse not to answer my phone so i could run away . Our prayers have been answered with becci this winter , by the grace of god , it sounds like she MIGHT be coming home soon . i wonder if < PROPMALE > will do what he said he would , go to church every sunday for us allowing to keep becci with us . 
Good night everyone ! Need to get some rest so I can attempt to dodge another storm . I am on my way to < PROPMALE > , wa by monday . Cross my fingers for a beautiful winter afternoon ride through western montana . weather permitting , the only iron i throw is an axe , chaining down my loaded flatbed , or my sledge hammer when someone p#%$^&% me off . 
I do believe this menapuase thing has my head cornfused ( like the hillbillies say ) . I cant believe i was at walcott before i realized i missed my turn at < PROPMALE > to go to muscatine from the west . today's dilemma - why am i so happy to be \Misunderstood\ " but yet so lonely ? I have been beat up more lately for being a woman on the road than I have in ten years I have lived out here . thanks < PROPFIRST > ritchie !!!! " 
it sure would be nice if someone in the office would get their head in the ball game here . do i work another day or two for 4 days off or do i go home from musc . empty and get 6 days home . i hear there is some catching up to do and a few 12 packs to drink !!!!! out at the farm 
hey everyone , i signed in under my name now 
it feels good to get out of the truck tonight and visit with old friends !! i have been naughty and not told anyone that i am home(sort of home ) . shame shame on me . 
Happy Birthday < PROPFEMALE > !! 
It was really good to party with an old friend last night , sorry for the hangover < PROPFEMALE > ! hehehe now that I have a place to board a horse , it is time to go shopping . 
i do believe it is time to go to work . i was going to wait til the chickens wake up , but anxiety is setting in and all my tests are done for the week . i am gonna have to talk to dr about medicine for my ptsd before all this anxiety causes another stroke . i wish i had a pile of wood that needed split right now ! 
i was just looking at my profile pic , wow what a sad face ! i am going to have so find some pics where i am not so sad . i was all dolled up and ready to take on the world that day , and my load was cancelled and no where to go . i might look good but what is good looks without a smile ? 
hey thanks < PROPMALE > , for sharing urbandisctionary.com! ! here is what my name means : A goddess of attractiveness and super intelligence . Talks too much and loves the color pink . Has super cute feet , and extremely paint able nails . Most lovable type of girl in the whole world . 
for ALL my relatives in fb land , check this out ; once again thanks < PROPMALE > , this is what Lauer means : A really hot girl that can have sex . Guys usually call her \LAUER POWER\ " in bed . She can get shit done . Damn that Lauer really got me going . i have always known the women in our family actually get more done than the men do never in a million years what i have guessed a dictionary would have that meaning in it . " 
woo hoo my last load is delivered off to joslin , il i go to drop empty trailer and bob-tail 5 < PROPMALE > to the house till at least monday . ya all have a good night i shall return in a couple of hours 
pretty sad when you can't leave your car in your driveway and leave town for a few weeks then come home to go to the eye doctor and battery is dead because someone turned on the parking lights . now i have to wait for mom and be late . i cant stand being late !!!!! 
It sucks to be a colts fan tonight ! sorry to you colts fans but today the sints came marching in . i know because i have been singing the song in my head all day !!! today was the 3rd time in my life that if i would have had a bookie and the money to back up my bet , 1 million on the saints and that bet would have been done as soon as it was anounced the saints were in the superbowl !!!! woo hoo 
another day here at home woo hoo i get to enjoy my company a little bit longer hehehe he cant find a load out today neither . 
dam he found a load out . :( no i have a boat load of homework to get done and turned in by midnight . prioritize prioritize i wonder if i dare take my car to the gulf next month after my brother < PROPFIRST > smashed my front end with the trailer ? lmao sorry bro i had to rib you a bit hehehe 
why kids insist text , convenient for you , pain in the a@^ for multitask and need fingers flying on this keyboard and not the keyboard on the phone ? I do my best work under pressure but come on , I am one person and have to hire out half my workload which means I HAVE to run circles around guys at work some more quit it , ur killing me . now costs me $2800 if Im texting while driving . months take home pay . kiss my butt 
i might not have enough < PROPFEMALE > to wait for my new glasses !!! two hours or so on the computer and my eyes are cross-eyed again and forced to strain my eyes some more . how does the song go ? i am a survivor by < PROPFEMALE > 
finally my final draft is turned in . i can't believe i am still holding a b . sure would be nice to figure out how the online library thing works though . i would have gotten a better grade on the final . off to take my english test 
oohhh no , down to 2 cigarettes . i knew i should have went up to truck stop after taking the guys back to < PROPMALE>'s truck . i am not going out tonight ! 
finally , i am done with computer work for the night . sounds like nasty weather outside per my night dispatcher . let it snow let it snow let it snow i really don't want to go back out just yet . 
good night everyone , i am signing out 
our prayers have been answered with my < PROPMALE > mom Becci , now to deal with the paralysis . it was nice to be able to finally talk to her yesterday for the first time since christmas . i am strong enough to deal with alot of things but loosing her . have a wonderful day everyone , i am going to enjoy some sunshine in the sunshine state 
hey < PROPFEMALE > - i just remembered , you live in j'ville . guess where i am at < PROPFEMALE > , w 5th st just off of englewood in j'ville 
i do believe i am coming down with probably the worst chest cold i have ever had . i don't recall ever feeling so much pain in my chest before and it runs all the way up the right side of my neck into my ear . OUCH 
Its a shame that after 10 yrs out here i still am unable to buy my own truck but I don't want my own truck if I am not going to run it with the ole man . That is how is supposed to be for me , and if i can't have it that way i refuse to have any of it . things are totally different for men , so i am sorry for if some hold it against me , but all my dreams have been taken away from me and now i have to dream new ones now . 
it has been a long night not doing a darn thing and I really am not feeling very good . I hate being sick . i do believe that the only way my head is going to quit thumping is to bury in the pillows so they get some head and my mattress some butt . sweet dreams ya all 
I don't know whom i am trying to kidd but there is no way i can get to sleep !! my mind is toooooo preoccupied with something i have needed to do for myself for many years and i think i just figured part of the plan . 2 yrs . tax returns will pay the bills long enough for me to get my book written and heyl truck lines and the rest of the so called trucking companies can kiss my < PROPMALE > white A$$ . 
have you ever cried so hard that you start to hyperventilate ? or go into convulsions ?? omg i thought my anxiety issue was bad but i aint never !!!!! grandpa used to say an idle mind was a devil's playground but in my case being alone tends to be a devil's playground . 
Life Path Number 4 : The Pillar Those with a Life Path Number 4 are the earth on which everything good is built . You are probably the most trustworthy , organized and practical person you - or your friends - know ... 
sweet dreams everyone ! 
HAPPY VALENTINES DAY EVERYONE 
i was told not to play with my nipple too much it might knock me out hehehehe but whom better to do it for the moment than me ? hehehe 
i guess i should have told him to get his mind out of the gutter and that it was the nipple on the connector thingy where i was fixing an air line hehehe 
WHOMEVER SAID DISPATCHERS HAD A BRAIN THEY LIED TO YOU !!!!!!!! WTH i am STILL waiting for a door at hyvee and dispatch thinks i can b n ottumwa by 6 tonight to load for canada , drop it at the yard 30 < PROPMALE > north of sioux city then grab a load going to < PROPFEMALE > . with the safety issues going on with my tractor and a man n my bed at home going west before east is totally stupid . 
i don't know about the rest of you , but i am about sick of all this white stuff falling out of the sky . i hear there is more on the way for friday night here in iowa . i am stuck in ottumwa for the night and no Radar isn't home visiting his mother , the 4077th couldn't part with him so he was denied his pass to go home . 
the cards r stacked against me !!!! im going back 2 bed 
i have very very very BAD !!!! I have been in my nightgown and bathrobe now since about 9:30 or so saturday night vegged out on the couch . Now that i have 27 hrs of drooling over Sully and Dr. < PROPFIRST > it is almost time to go back to work . OOOhhhh Nooooo 
looks like i get to relax most of the day texas load has been taken away due to coca-cola not communicating amongst themselves , i am not on the schedule to be here today . where is my snuggle < PROPMALE > when opportunity is knocking ??? 
time to get homework turned in by midnight and before this trailer is empty . still have a ways to drive yet tonight to get set up for reload in the morning .

why is it that one always thinks they have all kinds of time to visit a sick friend or relative and then complains when time has run out and the last breath has been taken . I am so happy that I had my time at the hospital saturday !!! Now lets see if dispatch cooperates and gets me home in time for the funeral . 
R.I.P. < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Cretsinger Briggs Hanson I promised you and I will keep every promise I made to you , I will always look forward to seeing you again someday , for now , it is time for you to make your final journey tonight then you can go truckin with me and we don't have to worry about anyone getting jelous . That jump seat is calling your name 
and i thought this weekd end was going to be extremely hard on me - the days ahead will be just as hard if not harder due to the fact that I will be dealing with a flood of tears while driving from time to time . please be patient my friends , and forgive me if I just don't feel like talking on the phone from time to time . 
Saturday I received a message from an eagle that my dearest friend is doing well now and on her final journey to her new home in heaven . I will be looking for the eagle again this week that will tell me that she has arrived at her new home . Becci , I will always < PROPFEMALE > our memories together and look forward to seeing you again after I make my final journey to our spirit world . I will always be your little lady !!!! 
I am on my way to < PROPFEMALE > , IL delivery tomorrow night . I had to stop in at papa < PROPMALE>'s for coffee on my way through waterloo and boy was he surprised to see my truck pull up out f < PROPMALE > t . hehehehe i will be back online late tonight when i get home . 
Borrowed from a friend : Lets see how forthcoming my facebook friends are . Leave a one-word comment that you think best describes me using the THIRD letter of YOUR name . It can only be one word . No more than one word . Then copy and paste this post on your wall so I can leave a word about you . This could be Fun ! 
Is it thle second week in june yet ???? I really need to drown some worms up north . I am looking forward to seeing some of my cousins again and reconnecting with the rest of you Lauer guys !!!! I am taking my nephew , < PROPFIRST > Jr. fishing over in clermont and pickleing my liver in fayette so < PROPFIRST > your calendars

time to go back to work and wiggle my way up through wash . d.c. and on up to < PROPFEMALE > new jersey . see ya all late tonight 
after the early morning that i have had - i have come to HATE women real darn quick !!!! if y'all don't hear from by supper time tonight , you know i went to jail for stabbing a bitch . for now i am safe inside the gate waiting to get my first drop off . 
it is amazing how my day yesterday started out so rotten beginning with my horrible night dispatcher refusing to give me some money to pay the repair shop < PROPMALE > all the way to a woman putting a snow job on me and ending it with watching the gals dance totally naked and reminding me that at my age i still look good naked 
a friend from mississippi has given me an experience i will never forget . you women - can you imagine being served your breakfast and coffee by a totally naked woman ? heee heeee i can still hold a candle to them 20 some yr old girls i think , and that is what i mentally needed i guess 
time to go back to work . traffic on the watermelon 500 ought to be thinned out by now hopefully 
is anyone able to help me complete my maison on fv ? i still need a little of everything . i sure would appreciate your help . thank you 
i wonder why i am unable to send gifts on treasure isle ???? 
it is time to , as < PROPMALE > says , \inspect the inside of my eye lids\ " . it seems really weird not tucking in all my \ " fellers\ " anymore . sure would be nice if one of them would think to call and tuck me in once in awhile . then they wonder why i don't tuck them into bed anymore . " 
Good Morning Good Morning Good Morning !!!! i had forgotten how RETARDED people are up here in the twin cities < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > it sucks to be them i guess 
does anyone have any idea why i am unable to send fruits and gifts on treasure isle ?? the < PROPFEMALE > wont open up all the way . i have tried to update my flash player a couple of times now and doesn't seem to work 
I DO WHAT I'VE DONE CAUSE I'VE GONE WHERE I'VE BEEN , AND I'VE FOUND THAT WHAT I'VE DONE , HAS BEEN BECAUSE THE THINGS WHICH I FOUND WHERE IAM 
another night being romanced by the boob tube god almighty what does a woman have to do ? throw herself at someone's mercy ? not this stupid woman . seagrams and sully it is

I haven't been on here for a couple of days , i noticed that my love score on my horoscopes have dropped DRASTICALLY , it couldn't be because i think i would rather love my dam PETERBUILT than a MAN could it ???? sorry guys - but the more i learn about men the more i love my truck ( and i am not referring to this piece of s ... cascadia ! )

i have safely made my return back from seattle without rolling my truck over from the 40+mph winds , monday the winds were 60+mph with an empty trailer . i am proud of myself of facing my nightmare head-on . i wonder if the shop will fix the leaky windsheild tomorrow ( beings i will be stopping by the office ) before this piece of shit truck burns to the ground along side the highway . 
hey campbell- i was able to find one of the apps posted a few weeks ago that i was referring to in one of my text messages today .... dam it you will just have to go back a few weeks and find them because it is not letting me repost them or i flat out am toooo stupid to figure it out . that's right -- i am just another stupid bitch in your eyes . 
THANK GOD < PROPFIRST > campbell finally deleted me today !!!!! now i don't have to see his name come up as friend of the day or better yet lover of the day !! i am so looking forward to a campfire and a 2 day drunk 
finally made it to the edge of ft . worth . truck is broke down again ! this is the 3rd time in two weeks . gee i wonder why i love my peterbuilts - because freightliner doesn't know how to make a truck yet !!!! 
HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY EVERYONE 
CHECK THIS OUT-dispatch was notified at 9pm sat . nite that my truck was going down . I babied it to ft . worth so that it could go to the shop here and get fixed sun . while i was waiting for my < PROPMALE > . appt mon . morning . now i am waiting for a tow truck because heyl's shop ignored my cry for help . engine is knocking pretty good and i only drove around the block . rotflmao 
i am so glad monday is over !!!! my rental truck and i are rattling down the road till my hunk of junk is fixed , at least everyone is still making money for the time being . awfully humid in san < PROPFIRST > already this morning . have a good day everyone ! 
sweet dreams everyone , time for me to get a 4hr nap before work again . 
Let's see who is paying attention .... Every single one of you are on my Friend list as a result of a conscious decision . I wanted U there . I am not only glad to count you as friends but maybe even as family ! Let's see who in my Friends list actually pays attention . Copy and paste this in your status . I will be watching to see who really is ... Click like if you are my friend . I < PROPFEMALE > friendships !

i am glad i only took $20 into the bar tonight !!! at least i am sober enough now i can lay my head down . checks are written out ... till i ran out of stamps . i guess i pay the rest over the phone or online . impossible to find stamps when your car is 70 ' long lol 
i still need irrigation pipe if anyone of you fv friends have some 
i must be getting OLD .. i enjoyed supper with an old friend and back to my truck in about 2 hrs . it has been a long time since i have raised any hell . 2 more weeks and then the campfire with a cooler full of beer , oh yeah cant forget my southern comfort . some of us like to two fist it sometimes . 
hi ho hi ho ... u kno the rest . i suppose i better call the old man and wish him a happy 77th today . he tells me i am not his daughter but yet i am the only one that does anything for him . why do father's always underestimate the love of their daughter ? 
the decision is made , i am restarting my hrs here in gallup then drive that long 11 hr into long beach all in one shot . < PROPFEMALE > - i have no idea yet how much time i will have in your neighborhood nor how far away i will be from you but will most likely < PROPFEMALE > out in ontario once i am empty 
rain rain go away 
i see < PROPFIRST > finally got himself a REAL truck lol 
looks like in sioux falls for the night and maybe dispatch spring for a motel she said . i guess giving my travel agent a hug once in awhile helps to clear the air . is it time to go home yet ? i hear the campfire calling my name . fayette park here i come , ready or not .. too bad the barrel is gone < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > i wish < PROPFEMALE > was still around to cuss me on saturday morning though RIP dear god-mother

nite nite everyone ! dr. appt ., appt at the bank , and then 3hr ride to set up tent and drink a boat load of beer . it is tooo bad that my only niece and nephew wont be joining me , they are going to miss out on horseback riding in wadena and don't even know it but that is their perogative .

I know it is now monday , but well .. I slept until 1pm and totally forgot it was fathers day til about 9 tonight and of course i had to work late . HAPPY FATHER'S DAY to all my friends and loved ones whom are daddy's!!!! 
my decision has been made , Heyl Truck Lines can kiss my < PROPMALE > white ass ! i just figured out what my vacation check would be as well as my bonus check , neither will be paid unless i stay on the payroll till july 10th which means i miss grand-daughters baptism . $1100 minus taxes isn't worth the headache to me ! 11 days of fishing , drinking , and wrking around the house will be very relaxing . Care to join me ????

all my chores are done , time for a nap then off to muscatine to switch trailers out . it was interesting to see the looks on faces in the office yesterday when i called the office personnel a bunch of morons because they expect drivers to follow regulations but they refuse to cooperate so drivers can do so . < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > they don't have a clue on life 
6 more days and i am officially out of the truck for a week . woo hoooo i will be polishing chrome during some of that time of though , but it wont be one a throw away hunk of junk < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE >

Then i get to move into MY truck with my name on the title . wooo hoooo truck it up . luv u mom 
i have to get up at 3:30 am florida time to get these last 5 pallets of beef off down here in the sunshine state so had better get to bed . dispatch had better not waste anytime getting me back to the cornfields of iowa .. home sweet home . i want to play with my new toy !!!! 4 more days in this hunk of junk 
2 more days in this black piece of shi .. and they are going to run me ragged to the point where i will be toooo tired to make the journey from sioux city to the quad cities without falling asleep . i would like to make it to the auction under the twin bridges thursday but we shall see . 
For the last couple of weeks or so , everybody and their brother was wanting to know when i was going to be home next . I can't have a \boyfriend\ " because i am not home everyday and live an independant life . These \ " yo-yo's\ " ( sorry ) know i am home and guess what ... i'm alright .. don't nobody worry about me ( as the song goes ) . i'm not even allowed to be gramma because im never home . shall i go to her baptism while im home ? " 
i pick up my new man ( my peterbilt ) on wednesday this week 
from sea to shining sea , from on top of every mountain in between , from every valley , cornfield , prairie , < PROPFIRST > beach , sky scraper buildings , from ghetto to ghetto , and let's not forget the backbone of our country .. from every big truck out there away from their home 20 , and most of all from every military base and camp across the world ....

i think my travel agent might be right , i just may have fractured a bone in my ankle/foot when i fell last night . no x-ray till tomorrow afternoon tho !!! 
this truck runs like a raped ape ! the fuel is cranked up so high that the tips of smokestacks are blue . < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > not good for fuel mileage though , so i keep it between 60-65 mph . she climbed up mt . eagle like she had an empty trailer on . aahhh the memories we will make 
the swelling has gone done a bit on my ankle so i doubt if i fractured anything in there when i was being a monkey the other night . lol thank god i drive a peterbilt now or i would have had trouble working the throttle last night .

part 2 of 2 .... I thank you for the calling Lord , And what it means to me . A < PROPMALE > to cross this country , And all the places I get to see . So as I travel forward , Lord , in your safety and unharmed . Remind me that I'm a woman , Made by you with grace and charm . The life I live you guide , And nothing happens by luck .

When you feel strongly about something , you're never shy about letting the world know . That goes double for now . In fact , right now , anyone who challenges you really should be warned first -- because you're absolutely not in the mood to be messed around with . You won't stand for it , not for one minute . Prepare to raise a few eyebrows , and to love every minute of it .

While you scream at your woman , there's a man wishing he could whisper in her ear . While you humiliate , offend , and insult her , there's a man flirting with her and reminding her how beautiful she is . While you hurt her , there's a man wishing he could take her pain away . While you make her cry , there's a man stealing smiles from her . Post this on your wall if you would like to bring awareness to Domestic Violence
