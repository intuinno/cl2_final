Hmm . A brand new day ... What to do .... I gotta find a way to K-town ... 
I believe everything happens for a reason . People change so that you can learn how to let go . Things go wrong , so that you appeciate them when they're right . You believe lies so you can eventually learn to trust no one but yourself , and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together .
