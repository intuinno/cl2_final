In the old days , it was not called the Holiday Season ; the Christians called it ' Christmas ' and went to church ; the Jews called it ' Hanukkah ' and went to synagogue ; the atheists went to parties and drank .

spent the day at the hospital , and now feels like a walking petri dish ... 
Mahatma Gandhi , as you may know , walked barefoot most of the time , which produced an impressive set of calluses on his feet . He also ate very little , which made him rather frail , and with his odd diet , he suffered from bad breath . This made him - ready for it ? - a super callused fragile mystic hexed by halitosis . ( Reposted from a friend's feed )
