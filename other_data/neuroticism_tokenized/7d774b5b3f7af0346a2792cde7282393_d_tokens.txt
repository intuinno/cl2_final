When you < PROPFEMALE > a Bible , the devil gets a headache . When you open it , he collapses . When he sees you reading it , he faints . When he sees you living it , he flees . And just when you're about 2 re-post this , he will try & discourage you . I just defeated him . Like Copy & paste this if you're in God's army . :) 
Hmmm ... should I erase my family and put my ACTUAL family members on my facebook profile ? 
DAMMIT ! got a mosquito bite on my forehead . -§§§- 
Just watched Inception ... OHMYGOSH ! 
You saw a shirt for $97 . You didnt have the cash , so you borrowed $50 from your mom and $50 from your dad = $100 . You bought the shirt , and had $3 change . You gave your dad $1 and your mom $1 and kept the other $1 for yourself . Now you owe your mum $49 and your dad $49 . 49+49 = 98 + your $1 = 99 . Where is the missing $1 ? \ 
... got mind-owned O.o
