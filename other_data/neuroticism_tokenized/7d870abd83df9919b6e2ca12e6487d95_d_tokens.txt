Stress Sucks ! 
why must people go out to restaurants on thanksgiving ? i thought it was supposed to be a day of resting at home with the family , it just makes people who are forced to work on holidays not get to see their famlies , ITS VERY FRUSTRATING ! 
i love the feeling of putting on nice warm pjs right after they come out of the dryer , its nice 
its cold 
... 
if its not one thing , its another ...
