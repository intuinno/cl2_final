have a personal reason for asking if everyone would put this as your status for 1 hour . I am pretty sure I know the ones who will . Think of someone you know who has or had cancer . My wish for 2011 is that a cure will be found . Will you post it for 1 hour to honor those who have fought or is fighting cancer ? Hope to see it in your status - it is an honor to comply
