Awesome news guys , I’ve cut down my drinking by 90% since Thanksgiving !! Those that know me know this is ummmm .... how do you say ... SHOCKING lol ... so , for instance during the weekend , you scroll thru your phone & say “Let’s call Tiffers , she’s big fun ! ” ... well I’m still big fun , but the night won’t include a large alcohol \binge\ " on my part lol ;-) " 
Nothin but positive words from me Tiger ( we ALL have our own dirt ) Congrats being named ATHLETE OF THE DECADE !! 1st athlete 2 become a billionaire , 64 WORLDWIDE titles to include 12 < PROPMALE > champs , 56 events on PGA tour , countless other records being set not 2 mention killin them on the course w/ a knee injury . Shake ALL haters off having a problem w/ ur achievement ... talent is unmatched & can’t be denied or ignored :)

Text ' YELE ' to 501501 to help raise money for Haiti . You will get a text confirmation and simply reply YES . It will charge you $5 .... please give !! They need our help & prayers :) Also praying all monies/support given to Haiti relief organizations will commit to distributing it directly to Haiti and supply the peoples needs the best way they can .

Life (& material things n it ) is not a right but a GIFT ! 2moro isn't promised & luxuries one's blessed 2 have r temp . Let's not take time 4 granted , but b thankful 4 each breath & strive 2 b the best we can b so when we meet our maker , HE will b pleased . Soooo ... ”What r u doin w/ ur time ? ” 
“And so even though we face the difficulties of today & tomorrow , I still have a dream” - Dr. < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > Jr. ... Thank you Dr. < PROPMALE > for not only dreaming , but being a man of fearlessness to be our “voice . ” Appreciation to you & the other leaders in the civil rights movement for the way you’ve paved :-) Lets be productive today FB fam ! 
Continue to pray and donate to those in Haiti . Again , my repost : Are we taking the lesson that time on Earth is precious ? Life (& material things n it ) is not a right but a GIFT ! 2moro isn't promised & any luxuries one's blessed 2 have r temp . Let's not take time 4 granted , but be thankful 4 EACH breath & strive 2 be the best we can be so when we meet our maker , HE will be pleased . Better yourselves & help others :) 
Put down that expensive arse Pomogranite juice !! Fun Fact : Did you know that coffee is the #1 source for ANTIOXIDANTS ?! If you can handle the caffeine , drink in moderation and leave out all that sugary stuff , it's highly beneficial :) 
No Sir !! I will NOT be playing the \Fine Game\ " and posting my score ... It would round up to about $10 anyway ... so no need lol :) "
