Feels like writing : What should I write about ? o.o 
14 more texts until the 21st ^^ ; 
so this whole quitting drinking soda bit is failing again 
3 of 6 packages measured out and cut for Intro to Multimedia and graphic design ... Now I just have to start thinking about what I'm going to write in a letter for English and then finish all the rest of the crapola tomorrow >.< 
Just now going to bed ... Can't believe I've been playing MW2 this long into the morning o.o 
I still have too much homework to do and not much will to do it xD 
You know I'm tired when I'm reading an article about the environment and compare humans polluting the earth to us giving the earth cancer >.> Plus I almost spelt reading \reeding\ " earlier ... I'm such a dummy v.v " 
Heroes in a half shell ... \ 
Turtle Power !

First time actually eating breakfast at 6am in a looong time 
Meh ... tummy ache 
Wish I had a decent fabric store and could operate a sewing machine without breaking it :S I'd definitely make some clothing lol . Might help if I had a job again , too :P 
Hello there , \ 
Evil little needle\ 
Adamentally prodding at my brain\ 
Dare I ask why ? \ 
\ 
An excrutiating pain\ 
Caused by nothing , and everything\ 
Headache :\ 
Everything about you I hate . 
Busy day and I dont feel that great lol 
Awesome day with Wil :] Went job hunting , played Magic at Hardees , and just got back from watching a Magic tournament at B&B . Very satisfying day for me =] 
Ahh I can finally set my laptop back down on my desk :D Yay for de-clutterization .... Now what to do with the pile I moved from my desk to my bed :S 
Artifact cards went poof D: Unless they're in my car :O But it's unlikely T.T 
Just brought all of my magic decks down to 60 cards =.= 
Meh 
Counting the days .... so ready for college to be over with . Tired of the homework business and being at school at 7:30 just to get out of class at 10 :S 
I always forget how relaxing exercising is . It's even better with some mediation kinda \woosa\ " stuff afterwords hah . Can't deny that I'm in a really good mood right now ! =] I have projects galore and a lack of motivation to do most productive stuff but right now I really don't mind :D I'll have more energy to do it tomorrow :P Positive procrastination . " 
Hush little baby don't say a word\ 
And never mind that noise you heard\ 
It's just the beasts under your bed\ 
In your closet in your head 
Two months =] 
Funny how you can wake up feeling refreshed , lively , happy , whatever then by mid day you feel like you've been run over by a train . Thanks life . Love you too . 
goin for a drive . not quite sure where to yet but im sure my car will figure it out 
It's kinda a good thing I decided not to go into storyboarding . I don't think people would very much like me mumbling away to myself as I doodle ( like I just caught myself doing ) 
I HATE STORYBOARDING !!!!!! D:< <<<<< I wish I could draw 
I give up . I can't do this stupid project . 
I can't draw I can't draw I can't draw I can't draw I can't draw I can't draw I can't draw I can't draw I can't draw I can't draw I can't draw I can't draw I can't draw I can't draw I can't draw I can't draw I can't draw I can't draw I fail at storyboards and I hate graphic design . 
Happy birthday < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > 
When your plans backfire , don't try to fall back on me . I'll already be gone . Appreciate me as I am now , and I'll always be there next to you - a true friend . 
Tuesday's homework : Complete . Now to play vidja games 8D 
I can't smile without you\ 
I can't laugh and I can't sing\ 
... \ 
You see I feel sad when you're sad\ 
I feel glad when you're glad\ 
If you only knew what I'm going through\ 
I just can't smile without you\ 
You came along just like a song\ 
And brightened my day 
I'm out of ideas for places to apply x.x 
Can't wait till next semester when I have no english courses to take . 
If I were asked to describe you in one word , I wouldn't be able to do it . Because you are nothing short of amazing and very much my everything . <3 
World of Warcraft 8 ) 
LOL . Was doing some research on renewable energy when I came across an article written by Barack Obama ( as a Senator while he was still running for President ) in 2009 . I'll never understand our government , to be completely honest . I don't understand why we have people trying to make changes in 2-8 years that'll just get screwed over by the next guy anyway . 
If I can learn the ways of the government I should run for President ! :D Dear Nation , prepare to be promised many things I cannot achieve alone ! Yaaay ! Allow me to send us into a spiral that knows no end ! ( And I'm not referencing Obama at all , really . I don't know anything about him . Whether his plans are any good or not , what stimulus is failing and going well . Oh wells . ) 
<3 Life 
Rah homework >>__<< 
? Big doodz by a little truck ! I can't draw well , my doodlez suck ! ? WHOOP WHOOP ! 5 cards of 100 done ! 
13/100 cards >.> It's better than the 4 I had before I guess xDD 
The world seems so much smaller and less threatening when you find someone that makes you truly happy . 
My dog howls along with every siren . >.< Cute sometimes unless you're trying to sleep ! 
Agh ! 34 more cards to make for my storyboard and 2 and a half more pages of freewrite for English and it's due Monday ! Lol . Im sooo frustrated !!!! 
Today was pretty successful homework-wise :] Still have LOTS to do tomorrow , though . 
Storyboard's done ... Now just have to do a rough of my research paper ! >.< 
No more homework !! ( Whoop whoop ! ) 
Have a good Thanksgiving people 
I could kill for the < PROPMALE > to go back a week and fix where I went wrong . All it took was one night for me to screw everything up , then a few more to screw up even more . But I got what I wanted , finally : an answer . Not the answer I wanted , but just something to know what he was thinking . Hopefully I can still patch things up later but right now I need to try to focus on what I need : more focus . xD On other things . 
Had a pretty awesome night . Thank you =] 
I want to go do something . Iunno what I wanna do though . 
English is the devil !!!! I've lost all motivation to keep working on it but it's worth the majority of my grade :S 
:) 
Conference on my research paper tomorrow and it's only half done . Awesome !! I though I had enough information but hardly any of it really relates with each other ! Lol . 
Blue eyes are awesome . Just saysin . 
Super excited :] I love having plans . 
A little more confident about my research information stuffs for my paper . Was having problems finding stuff past 1995 but all I had to do was look at the more political side of things ... I hate politics lol . 
I hope I make some plans to go out today . I also should probably do some cleaning ... and read < PROPMALE>'s chapter he sent to me ( sorry bro ! ^^ ;) . Then I also have to send my Spanish teacher an email because for some reason I scheduled a conference for my last assignment dealio for a time I have class lol . Silly , silly . Could be quite a busy day if I set my mind to it . 
What do I want for Christmas ? 
Tomorrow's my last day of Foundation Seminar ! Yay ! And my last day of actual Spanish class although I don't know when I'm going to get my silly conference in with her . Some time this week . Two more class periods of Illustrator and one more of Intro to Multimedia and Graphic Design ! And English ... well ... That class is a bummer and I still have to finish going to every class , including Friday . Lol . 
Kill < PROPMALE > Volume 1 then bed ... hopefully : ) 
Done with Spanish and Foundations ! Another day of Illustrator and Intro to Multimedia and Graphic design and two more of English and I be done for this semester ! 
Slept really well last night : ) Got another class out of the way . Have to write a memo thing , finish up my research paper , and do another mini research paper thing by Friday . Oy vey . 
Just ordered a pair of jeans for $73 with S&H and tax ... DANG YOU GAP ! Why must your jeans fit my long legs perfectly but be so expensive ! Walmart needs to start providing X-Longs lol . 
Filling up my tank costed me $25 today ! What the [ insert long string of profanities here] !?!?!?!?!?!?!?! 
Got a new puppy yesterday : ) Have no idea what his name is yet but he's a cutie . Also had an awesome couple of days with < PROPFIRST > . We went to Hannegans and the Arch and Riverfront . : ] 
One more paper then I can say \Bye-bye\ " to Honors Comp I !!! ( and all Comp courses ... just have to take one more lit course of some sort ) " 
Finished my Final paper for Honors Comp . Now to shower and play Forza : ) 
Going back blonde as soon as I can afford it lol . I'm tired of needing to dye my hair . I just have to figure out what color blonde my natural hair color is again . 
I hate how much guitar strings make my fingers hurt :/ No wonder I never really learn how to play ! Lol . 
%*(#&@(*^%##$ rawr guitar . I want my saxophone back :'( 
Just got done watching Tron with < PROPFIRST > : ) Pretty freakin ' awesome . And as everyone was leaving it definitely seemed like a Four Rivers reunion lol . I saw a few people from my class and < PROPFIRST > saw a few people he knew from there and the one dude was there . Yeah ... that one . Kozark ? I think that's his name . 
Ugh so sleepy ... was really awake earlier when < PROPFEMALE > king chocolate stuffs with my < PROPFEMALE > . Now I'm crashing . Lol . Pretty lazy day today again . Lots of Dynasty Warriors 6 and bought new bulb things for my Neon . Now I just have to learn how to replace the old bulb with a new one so I can go drive somewhere again without having to worry about getting pulled over or hit for a lack of left turn signal . 
Watching Meet the Spartans .... probably the dumbest thing I've ever since in my entire life . 
Dad's home : ) 
< PROPFEMALE > Day after Christmas since I didn't really tell many people < PROPFEMALE > Christmas lol . 
Doesn't matter how late I stay up , I can never sleep in . Still woke up at 8 today : ( Darn it . 
Played Kinect last night . Pretty fun : ) 
Mooooooom ! < PROPMALE > said I sounded like a cat choking : ( 
OMG I slept in a little later WHOO !!! Finally ! 
To write , draw , or play more Dynasty Warriors . Hmm . 
Bored . 
Oh , Mt . Dew , how I miss you ... And Dr. Pepper ... but I have you most of the time when I go out to eat ... 
Gots all A's and B's so far in college lol . Not that this degree's going to matter because I don't know what to do with it . 
Whelp . Was going to do some cleaning today but I got myself addicted to the Undead expansion dealio for Red Dead Revolver ^^ ; Guess there's always tomorrow ! Lol . I gotta reapply at the nursing home tomorrow too hopefully . And I have to get gas yet today or tomorrow ! I'm scared of how much it's gonna cost lol . 
So sleepy ! 
Uuuugh so much organizing after this past semester . Just thrown out like 400 papers that were just sitting on my desk . I have a lot more < PROPMALE > stuff than I thought too . And magic cards .... I almost want to burn them ! Lol . Almost . 
I don't know where else to apply >.> Stupid businesses and their lack of hiring . 
I'm thinkin ' another lazy day . I'm still sore from walking around the mall two days ago lol . I'm such a weakling . 
Well ... That was the best three or four hours of sleep I've probably ever gotten ... But what am I supposed to do now ? Lol . 
Hot Chocolate <3 
Started writing again WHOO ! Doubting it'll last long though lol . 
Finally , I night I can listen to music all night :] I don't get these very often . 
It never feels likes I've slept long enough ! 
Just woke up o.o 
Will not have Xbox Live until I get a job again T.T 
Mr. Laptop , \ 
I would appreciate it if you quit freezing on me . \ 
The only time you work well is when you're plugged in , and I don't appreciate that very much . DO WORK ! \ 
Thanks for your time , \ 
Your Owner . 
Just applied at Schnucks , Target , and WalMart . So hopefully if the nursing home doesn't call me back soon I'll at least have somewhere to go :/ 
Random afternoon nap ... I hope I get called for a job soon because I'm tired of being so lazy . 
I don't know if I should be happy or angry that I don't show up on Google . Lol . 
Idk if Kinect is going to help me feel better or kill me lol . I'm in pain right now . Lol . Squats = Ouch . 
If anyone knows of any part time jobs in Union/Washington please let me know ! No idea where else to apply . Nursing home can't take me this time and I'm doubting I'll get into Target , Walmart , or Schnucks still because I've already applied there 2-4 times . 
Declined from Target , JCP , Dollar General , Dollar Tree , and the nursing home . Oy vey . C'mon Schnucks or Walmart or any other place I've applied . This isn't fair . 
Just got done hanging out with the awesome < PROPFEMALE > Eagan . Now I'm just waiting for a certain someone to get home so I can talk to him . : ) 
I gots a job back at the nursing home ! Whoo !!!!! So excited ! 
I was looking through my suggested friends and realized that I haven't even heard of more than half the people's names . Why's everyone gotta know so many people ? 
School tomorrow ! Not really looking forward to it . At all . Lol . 
Done with my first day of school ! Flash Animation was at 9 , then Illustrator II at 10:30 . Already have some nursery rhyme project in Illustrator . Anyone have suggestions for nursery rhymes to illustrate ? Also got my orientation done for work . And my TB shot ... blech . I hate shots ! 
Funky school day , here I come . Drawing I at 11:30 am- 1:20 pm . Some dealio with fitness and wellness around 2 . Spanish II at 6pm . I am going to hate Mondays and Wednesdays . 
Driving home was not fun lol . Hoping for no school tomorrow so I can go to work early ! Although I do like my tuesday and thursday classes more than mondays and wednesdays . Speaking of MW classes , I have two different Spanish teachers ! What the heck ?! One Monday then the other Wednesday . Ima be confused . 
School's closed tomorrow . Go figure . Lol . 
First 12 hour day in 6 or so months . Hands are already lobster red from bleach and washing them repeatedly . Just got home from going to the bowling alley with < PROPFIRST > . Had a lot of fun but I'm super sore and ready for the rest ! Lol . 
Whelp . Dogs ate something plastic with christmas trees on it while I was at school and now little Sumo's vomitting up plastic shards . Fun . 
If your dad is a hard working man and is your hero , helps you no matter how bad you are or is just the BEST DAD EVER , if you are blessed to still have your dad or if he is an angel in heaven , paste this to your status and let everyone know you are PROUD of your dad , and that you love him dearly . You can replace a lot of people in life ... but you only have one dad . 
Spanish homework x.x This semester's going to suck . Just spanish . Mondays are going to be the best though because Sra Meyer is the bomb diggity . I'm not sure about Mrs Aramburu yet . She seems like she might be okay . It's just going to be odd switching between them :/ I might end up dropping the class . 
Are you ready for HALO ! REACH !?! D8 < 
I don't have to sit at school with nothing to do until 6 today yaaay ! Brought my laptop and magic cards although I don't know if I'm going to play yet or not . 
I am a fariy 
If you like cheese , but hate macoroni then you can go to H ! @$ 
So I just figured out that there's a Spanish class that fits better into my school schedule than the one I have now . The thing is , if I take that class instead I have no idea when I'll do my workout junk . 
I'm at school tomorrow from 8am till 8pm tomorrow lol . Fun fun . 
Looking up classes for summer and getting pumped for an 8am hour long workout orientation dealio at the college ! > 8D The thing is I think I signed up for a day that had like 4 other guys going too :/ I wasn't thinking . Lol .

Anyone else get a \Final Notice\ " from Customer Service or something like that in their Hotmail asking for the password and such ? I've been scammed enough to know not to put my info in before I hear if anyone else has gotten it . It wasn't in my other Hotmail inbox so I figured I'd see if anyone else has it . " 
Goodnight friends and family and anyone else on my facebook : ) 
Cranky . Just spilt my supper on the carpet after another 12 hour day . Have dry lobster red hands from washing hands 3 times every 5 minutes and from bleach . Mashed potatoes , I officially hate you . Lol . 
They've got \ 
A power and a force\ 
that you've never seen before . \ 
the ablilty to morph\ 
and to even up the score . \ 
No one will ever take them down\ 
the power lies on their side\ 
Go Go Power Rangers\ 
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers 
was just looking for my phone while talking to my dad on the phone . Smart , < PROPFEMALE > . 
I wanna be the very best\ 
Like no one ever was\ 
To catch them is my real test\ 
To train them is my cause\ 
I will travel across the land\ 
Searching far and wide\ 
For each Pokemon to understand\ 
The power that's inside\ 
Pokemon ! \ 
It's you and me\ 
I know it's my < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Will be reading and playing Pokemon . You'll have to call or text to get ahold of me for a while . 
So I just read a book that I've had for like 4 years called The Capture thinking it would be the only book ( a whole story ) , but unfortunately I now have to find the next book called The Journey so I can figure out what happens to all the owls lol . Yes , owls . All the characters are owls that have had their nests raided by psych o-o wls that have some kind of \orphanage\ " of mind-washed \ " orphans . \"" 
gonna read Maximum Ride Vols 1 & 2 then play some Pokemon then maybe start rereading the Twilight books 
playing against a party of 10th prestige 70's with aimbots and glitches galore 
Hoping for 57 and a half hours on my paycheck . Please be off school Thursday too so I can make this happen ! $400 baby ! 
yaaay work ... Lol . 
One more 12 hour day then I'm off for 3 days 8 ) I hope we don't have school still Friday . But i also hope the weather is nice Sunday ! I want to go to < PROPFIRST>'s . 
Why can't I sleeeep ?! 
Change of plans , Spring 2010 should be my last semester at ECC hopefully lol . I think I've got my classes planned out ... 
I've probably slept a good 5 hours during the day today . I didn't realize how much work took out of me lol . 
Lo que no sabes tu , tu tu\ 
Que mi amor eres tu tu tu tu tu\ 
El corazón me late solo cuando a mi lado < PROPFEMALE > tu\ 
Y se emociona y suena tucu tucu tucum tu .. 
Feels like playing the Sims but doesn't have a mouse .... 
Whoo hoo ! It's finally starting ! 
Wish I had some chips and dip or some kinda snack . 
Whoo yeah Packers ! 
You never realize how thirsty you are until a drink of water turns into chugging the whole bottle in 10 seconds or less . 
I hate being at school by myself for multiple hours :/ Should have gone home again today before Spanish at 6 ... I might yet ... idk . 
I did make the < PROPFIRST>'s Academic Honors List for Fall 2010 . How about that . ^_^ 
Got my room half way cleaned and reorganized ... I just have so much clutter ... I don't know what to do with it but I still insist that I need all of it ! Lol 
I hate training people . So what if I may be the most clean , quick , and experienced aid in the kitchen ? Not to brag - Im disappointed that I am . I wish more of the kitchen aids would be willing to try for the residents ' sake . I dont speak well as it is , and I have to try to explain to someone how to do my job with my 50mph stuttering . But oh well . Its best for the residents I think . Gotta love them :) 
Oookay , so maybe I'm not getting XBox live this paycheck ^^ ; School and work stuff's more important anyway ... and eating ... eating's good . And a budget in general . Lol . 
I still hate training . Lol . And my arms are lobster red again . Lovely . Only this time its all the way up to the elbows . I still have one more 12 hour day to go ! I love the weekends I work . ( Really , I do . Its not so bad working there once theres a decent crew . Got a good feeling about our two newest employees . I still think I can handle it just fine with the \main three\ " though . But ... I have school so maybe not lol . ) " 
I . want . to . sleep . Why can't I get to sleep ?! :( 
I haven't decided if I'm looking forward to school or not tomorrow . Kinda am . Kinda not . 
i just want to freaking sleep ... 
I don't think there's a version of the chocobo theme song I don't love lol 
Tired of being in Spanish already . 
Ready for some EXCITEMENT . Everything's boring right now lol . I need a party or something . 
Whenever I do lose weight , I want to go cosplaying . Right now I'd like to cosplay as Rukia from Bleach or Hinata from Naruto . \Lucy\ " or Nyu from Elfen Lied would be kinda fun too . " 
Fireworks is a good song and all , but I'm tired of hearing it every time I get in my car 
Anyone know some decent artists ? ( not as in music artists ) I'd like to find some inspiration for a Friday drawing due the 2nd and I don't even know where to start . 
Shouldn't be majoring in anything < PROPMALE > related . I get discouraged too easily . 
I want ice cream .... fudge , vanilla , choco chip , < PROPMALE > , or a mix of everything idc .. 
Okay , so I have discovered that black , brown , red , and blonde hair all look good on me . But an orangey-blonde ... not so much . Lol . Stupid dye kits always messing up my color ..... 
I can't believe I actually like working out lol . 
Working on my Friday Drawing for Next Wednesday . Night all . 
Om nom pizza ^^ I have Z1077's songs stuck in my head :/ It's always like 5 of them repeated . Firework needs to go away . So does Teenage Dream but that's the one I have stuck in my head primarily right now and it makes me want to do a jig lol 
Okay this getting ignored thing is getting old quick lol . Quit it ! Lol 
Cold , Tired , Hungry , and Playing Sims 2 . And watching my sims also be cold , tired , and hungry >:) Take that ! Suck it Trebek ! 
Stay in your thoughts , they'll keep you safe\ 
And let the outsiders think you're crazy 
it's out of my budget , but i'm getting xbox live again . I'm tired of this sitting on facebook junk 
Ah , COD . I've missed you :) 
Will hopefully no longer have orange hair after this 30 mins is up :) Hopefully ... 
Blueberry ! 
So glad the weekend's over with . AND ! I don't have to deal with inspections at work when they come in ^_^ Yayzies . Hopefully the new girls got everything down . 
I can never find my stupid phone lol . I need , it it's my alarm clock Xl 
Played Magic for the first time today since I dated Will ^_^ Small steps , small steps . Lol . 
Spent the evening with Topher McCreary . Those were the best games of Halo : Reach ever lol . Win . COD's still better though [ James ] . 
I guess I'm really not shy . If I don't talk to you much , I probably just don't have anything to say :) 
Go to your profile . The first 5 friends in your sidebar are your team in the upcoming Zombie Apocalypse . How screwed are you ? \ 
< PROPFEMALE > Eagan , < PROPFEMALE > Temme , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Dunakey , Topher McCreary ( <3 ) , < PROPMALE > Holley . \ 
Well . That's not so bad :) 
Whew ! That was a lot of \Happy Birthday\ " s to say \ " Thanks\ " to lol . " 
Helping people figure out factoring gives me migranes . I haven't had math in 2+ years and I'm not looking forward to taking it this summer lol . 
Out of the close to 200 photos I've taken today , I'm finally uploading 21 of them lol 
Everyone else is becomming single again . What gets into the air to make that all happen during weekends ? 
I need a < PROPFEMALE > tale to remake for Flash Animation . Suggestions ? 
Ate a lot today then just got done exercising a few minutes ago . My stomach feels like it's going to explode 
When the darkness creeps in\ 
The fears begin to win\ 
Nightmares ensue\ 
U wish they werent true\ 
U wake up and are fine\ 
But the dreams , still on ur mind\ 
Dig a hole into ur heart\ 
And u feel ripped apart\ 
U cant ease the pain\ 
And u rest , stressed and drained\ 
Theres a reason u are tortured\ 
In ur life , theres much disorder\ 
Fix ur problems now , and dont wait . \ 
U'll have peace when u awake . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > Temme 10/23/2010 
I'm tired of being sick . 
feels like playing Spore 
DIABLO II WHOOOOOOOOOO ! And Spore .... Lol . 
Grr to Diablo for not wanting to play on my computer ! 
Rango and < PROPFIRST > were both A-Mazing . Topher McCreary took me to see them :) And he took me to DQ too . AND ! We saw some pretty awesome older cars ( makes me giddy on the inside ) :] I love spending time with him . Couldn't ask for a more perfect day ! 
Well , what to do ? 
Drove 47-AD , UU-EE , 47- St. < PROPFIRST > , then 47-Washington . I'm still bored . 
You and I end up in a police car together : Using only 4 words , what would you say to me ? Note : If you comment , you must copy and paste this as your status , so I may comment on yours as well . Be a good sport and play along ... 4 words are harder than you think . 
I am so crabby tonight -.- 
so so SO ready for this stupid weekend to be over . It's the work weekend I've had to date . 
Friend : \You have a lot of different faces when you take pictures . \ " \ 
Going to be dropping my Spanish class . 
Get . Your . < PROPFEMALE > on ! \ 
All it takes is a little faith , \ 
Believe it ! \ 
Get your < PROPFEMALE > on ! \ 
Listen to your heart and feel it beating strong ! \ 
When you're in doubt , glitter it out ! 
has a date with < PROPMALE > Kimbrough tomorrow . Just to make everyone aware , because I can . :] 
So dinner at the Union Grill , a movie ( Sucker Punch ) , ice cream , and hanging out with Chip is probably the best day/night/first date ever : ) I did lose my phone , but on the other hand , I found my artifact Magic cards I've been missing since October :] 
Will be getting a phone with unlimited texting in a few days :) I will need everyone's number since I lost my old phone , though . 
BBQ with Chip and his family tomorrow :) 
on facebook with my new blackberry w00tfishsauce !!!
