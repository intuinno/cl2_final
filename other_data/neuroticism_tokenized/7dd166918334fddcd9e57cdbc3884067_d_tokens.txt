I Have contacted old friends in which i have found childhood memories with . I hope to get to know them as adults . Smiles & Giggles ... Amanda 

I'm living in Southern < PROPFEMALE > now ; I'm right across the bay from Solomons Island . I just moved ( one month ago ) from North < PROPFEMALE > . 
Well , I have found ( 3 ) old friends all from different age groups of my life . Yeah , This is a good day reliving childhood ! 
To whom cares ... I'll be attending a wedding this weekend in New Jersey , and will return on Monday . I hope to post some pictures next week ... Have a great weekend ! 
I have a mission ! The goal : I'm going to say 500 Hail < PROPFIRST>'s for a precious friend . I will post the count ! 
Yesterday , When we returned from our weekend in Jersey , There was a small storm , as soon as it was over , I grabbed my dog and walked out to the beach and just watched the energy transfer across the water it was so beautiful . 
Hail < PROPFIRST > count ... 380 left :) 
I have tears in my eyes and a tear in my heart , ( Not from my man ) 
Lalalala ... To error is human , to forgive is divine . This is a easy statement to agree with , but when the shoes are hurting your feet , who wants to wear them ? 
Hail < PROPFIRST > count .... 262 left almost there .... 
Hail < PROPFIRST > count ... 144 left out of 500 . 
Hail < PROPFIRST > count ... 85 Left out of 500 . 
Sister Carol ... I miss you ... xoxoxo 
How great ... I love your perception . I won an award at school for a photograph i took , and it was published on the cover of our first edition . When i get time i'll place it on my profile . The next time I'm in Summerville i want to get a group of old frien 
Time is precious , and it is all we have .. Carpe Diem 
I MISS QUADRATIC EQUATIONS !!!!!!

It seems at times that nothing goes away ; it just changes owners 
< PROPFEMALE > Aguilera say's it best ... \I am beautiful no matter what you say\ " .. meant for someone not to my friends .. " 
When do you know ; it is time to stop trying ? 
I finish my 500 Hail < PROPFIRST>'s , and did some more for myself . I challenge everyone who knows \Hail < PROPFIRST >\" to do at least 10 . It should only take 1 1/2 minutes . " 
Don't be jealous of someones blessings ; It stops yours from coming . 
Well i have about ten hours in that garden now and only have 5 % done . I'll have a small crew next week to put a dent into the work ! Yeah !!!!! 
Yeah , it is Friday ! I just got a Six pack of Miller Chill and i'm going to the beach , Without the dog ! :)

the group asking everyone to change their profile picture to their \ 
favorite cartoon characters is actually a group of child molesters . \ 
Their doing it because kids will accept their friend requests faster if \

violence , It was on a tv show ... that warns you about internet \ 
frauds ..... Please copy and repost

To everyone who is calling for stricter gun laws in light of the tragedy in Tucson , may I offer this little tidbit : If guns kill people , then pencils misspell words , cars drive drunk , and spoons make people fat . Remember : Hold the person accountable for their actions , not the means they chose to utilize !!! ( Reposted from another friend's status message . Feel free to do the same )
