I can't believe that when I come back to school after being out sick three days , my teacher expects me to have done all of my work and not need any \make-up days . \ " We had to draw on white paper bags . \ 

No .... we have school tomorrow . :P 
Come home at 3-4 last night to find a storm coming around . Tornado went past our house and the hail didn't harm us . Poor < PROPFIRST > , spent the night with my sister . \ 
\ 
Then we had a power outage and lit every candle in the house . The smoke/fire alarms went off and we found ourselves blowing out every single candle and sleeping in darkness . How fun . 
Happy Hanukkah everybody ! jk Happy Easter . 
Writing a song ((: 
Loved the Talent Show , I personally thought I was bad . -but a few people told me otherwise . :P \ 
Thank you all for listening to me with bleeding ears . <3 
Oh the boredom . It's so quiet in my house that I feel like I'm being watched . o____o ' 
It feels like my whole world is falling apart ~ Deep down inside ; Even from the start . One day we were finally there , they tore us apart . How could they dare ? Consumed by the truth , Did the light of day fade ? Do you remember , The trees and their shade ? You promised , lied , But I never denied . That one day , we'd find different paths . Because whoever you were , it never did last . \ 
Vent poem about one of my best friends . 
Guy : Hey you hear about May 21st ? \ 
Girl : May 21st , 2011 ? \ 
Guy : Yea many Christians believe its the judgement day . They repeat that they have went over the Bible many times and traced it to that exact day . \ 
Girl : . . . \ 
Guy : They said God gave them the \message\ " to spread the word . \ 
Sometimes the days may seem bright to the world around the crowded eye , but does one see the rain through those bright rays ? Does one truly see the cold darkness reach out to grab another . No , they are too consumed in their selfish and twisted webs of never ending lies . - 
After all she had done , how far she had walked , the days she waited for them . They never did return and the path had become tiresome for the girl , but she continued on with the certainty that she would be a loyal friend . In the end the girl sat down to realize that loyalty was what she lacked for her friend and the misunderstanding took her back to that day where she was free . -and all alone . 
WOO . Lady Gaga's on American Idol , < PROPFIRST > Escudero ! She's singing \Edge of Glory . \"" 
Woah , Lady Gaga ............. that was interesting . 
Why be scared of monsters , if they kill you , it's a lot more peaceful on the other side . haha 
Giggle moopaley . * < PROPFEMALE > Clingenpeel * 
I don't get why there is a poke button when there could b a stab with fork button .. stupid facebook . - . - 
Sometimes I wonder how stupid a person can get , then I remember the song \Friday . \ " /facepalm " 
You all better remember what happens in nine days . = u=' Jk , it doesn't matter . 
Missing my < PROPMALE > . : I 
Yay Birthday tonite and school this morning . Fun :P

Finally getting around to making a new YouTube account . P : Wondering if I should give a link . :S 
Sheesh woman cut her some slack it's her Birthday . 
I hate when people say : \Woah this is better than Twilight ! \ " I want to scream : \ " ANYTHING is better than Twilight ! \"" 
July 4th is my favorite \holiday . \ " <- It's the day things blow up and nobody really get's in trouble !! :D " 
When in doubt , sleep . :P Night peeps .

Thunder , lightening , oh so frightening . P : Storm is over . :( 
Wow . Ok . So I have to go back to the passport office because my hair was covering my eyes and I looked like a murderer . smh . 
IF YOU WANT YOUR HAIR TO REMAIN NORMAL ... DON'T GO TO GREAT CLIPS . D; I am ruined . 
The rain at our house sounds like a carwash on the windows ! :D I want to stand outside ... but I don't want to die . Hahaha . Storms = <3 
I used to hate when teachers would always ask boys to < PROPFEMALE > boxes and stuff . <- Some girls can be just as strong . 
A falling < PROPFEMALE > , fell from your heart .. and landed in my eyes . I screamed aloud as it tore through them , and now it's left me blind . <3 
Every day seems so wonderful , then suddenly , it's hard to breathe . <3 
You're whatever works best for you . If they can't take it then let it hurt , but be who you are . 
I'm in Alaska ! 
Helicopter ride and dogsledding on a glacier ? I think yes . :) Awesome !! 
MOM . LEAVE ME ALOOOONE . -I don't want your ideas , this is my project . - 
I love how you think I still miss you , but you're probably right . <3

Yo my new school is huge and confusing . xD And it has stairs . WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE ?! 
Halloween , get here soon ! I wanna break in to ILMS and join the Halloween Party ~ :D 
Whispers through the trees . \ 
They sing their silent melody\ 
Of breaking < PROPFEMALE > and aching hearts . \ 
When did all this madness start ? \ 
When you fell upon this starry road-\ 
This scaring road of broken dreams . \ 
To ever be repaired , I ask . \ 
To ever be repaired ? \ 
For one will not know until < PROPFEMALE > sets in . \ 
What I know is what I believe is within . <3 
< PROPFEMALE>'s Got Talent . :D The least talent I've yet to seen ! 
Yay ! :) Almost home ! 
3 Hours until we hit Ohio ! :D 
The sad moment when we've resulted to singing High School musical songs on the way back home ... smh < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Sullivan 
< PROPFIRST > Lamb - DON'T DIE . : C 
The sad moment when you wake up from your dad snoring 4 rooms away . -_-' 
It's hard to dry your hair without a blow dryer .. and therefor even harder to straighten . * Holds hair up to fan and whips hair back and forth * 
I want to sleeeeep . Can I skip school ? :P 
But I set fire to the rain , watched it pour as I touched your face . Well , it burned when I cried . Because I heard it screaming out your name . </3 
smh , some people 
3 Hours I got to see you guys . :( I'll miss you again ! Tell me when there's another dance and I'll see you guys . Okay ? </3 
You like her anyway , she likes you . Bye . 
Plain old < PROPFEMALE > told a story bout a man , who was too afraid to fly so he never did land . -Drops of Jupiter 
Ugh . 8:00 - turn off the alarm 9:00 -turn off the alarm 9:45 dad comes in and wakes me up for a party at 12:00 . Dx JSKWOSX

Wow .. that's a shocker .. the Panthers don't completely suck this year . 
< PROPFEMALE > that falls from weary sky\ 
Sacrifice the cautious eye\ 
Sacrifice yourself instead\ 
Bringing other's to their deaths . \ 
How so cruel\ 
You broken star ? \ 
How could you allow to fall\ 
Another with you , \ 
We've been told . \ 
The people you took , \ 
Some young , Some old . \ 
Never forgotten , \ 
Never memory sold . \ 
I know I haven't forgotten 9/11 , how about you ? </3 
Ew ... my cat just brought me a cricket ... again . 
When you asked me if I'd miss you and I didn't reply , it was because I had already died inside . </3 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Sullivan what are you up to ? :) 
Everytime I hear these songs , I think of you . Everytime I see your picture , a weird part of me misses you . Everytime I was with you , I felt so happy and warm . I felt that today , and I hurt inside . </3 
Oh great , four kids on the bus like me .. smh .. White girl gonna get killed . :P 
< PROPFIRST > Lamb I need to talk to you right now !! D: 
Me : -sleeping-\ 
My dad : < PROPFEMALE > ? -knocks on door-\ 
Me : Huh what ? \ 
My dad : Are you sleeping ? \ 
Me : Not anymore ...? \ 
My dad : Okay . -walks to living room-\ 
Me : -faceplant into bed- :/ TIRED . 
< PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > was Dr. Cockroach in Monsters and Aliens - Thanks Google .. All I was looking for was the Dominos number .. 
You throw me down to pick me up . You shoot me down to stop my death . Wrong or right , you can't decide- while you've left me to the side . How hard is it to write your name ? As hard it is to take the blame ? Who you are , I do not know .. as you've left me here , in the cold . 
Goodnight world , and all it's wonderful inhabitants . <3 For all you murderers , stalkers , child abductors .. You make me sick . :) 
OH MY GOSSHHH ! <3<3<3 RECORDING STUDIO - I THINK YES . * AUDITIONS ! HEHE *

Add me on Skype - Astral . Erica :) 
You only judge me because of who I was . :) 
Can I sleep in tomorrow , pleaaase ? :(

[ ] yur sweet\ 
[ ] i have a crush on you\ 
[ ] i once had a crush on you\ 
[ ] post this as yur status so i can like it (: \ 
[ ] I love yuh ? (NH ) 
The moment you realize that you aren't as lonely as you feel . <3 
( Why am I doing this ? haha ) Single or NOT put this as your status . If you think I'm attractive . ( Poke ) If you think I'm good friend . ( like ) If you think I'm weird . ( comment ) If you wanna date me , be honest . ( message ) If you love me . ( comment with a ? ) If your bored and not scared , make this your status 
You know you have no life when you sit listening to music on Youtube for hours and stare at your ceiling , daydreaming about changes you should have made in your life when you had the < PROPMALE > . 
-Does not understand why people think the SAT is hard- :/ 
Sometimes I really wonder why we say goodbye when we can say hello another time . :) 
If I have ever made you laugh . { Like My Status } If I have ever made you smile . { Poke Me } If I have ever made you confused . { Comment on my status } Repost this if you're wondering what people would say to you . :) 
You know how I said , I'd never say hello again ? Remember that smile , as I walked away ? It was fake , it was a lie , inside all I wanted to do was cry . </3 
It doesn't matter your size or what you look like , if people are too arrogant to see that then whatever .. 
Remind yourself this everyday : No matter what you look like , someone always loves something about you . 
When you try your best , but you don't succeed . When you get what you want , but not what you need . When you feel so tired , but you can't sleep . Stuck in reverse ... When tears come streaming down your face . When you lose something that you can't replace . When you love someone , but they go away . Could it be worse ? Lights will guide you home . I will try to fix you . <3 
I want you to know that wherever you go , I'll always miss you . Please see that when you're here with me , I don't ever want to let go . But that's how life is , cruel and unfair . Sometimes you've got to stand tall , send out a prayer , to anyone who cares ~ </3 
< PROPFEMALE > is listening to Coldplay ... Coldplay makes < PROPFEMALE > happy . < PROPFEMALE > being happy means that you need to watch your back . just kidding ... :D 
I'm just one of those ghosts , traveling and listening . Don't need no roads , in fact they follow me . And we just go in circles . Now I'm told that this is life and pain is just a simple comprise , so we can get what we want out of it . Would someone care to classify our broken hearts and twisted minds so I can find someone to rely on ? And run to them , to them ... full speed ahead . And you are not useless , we are just misguided ghosts . Traveling and listening , the ones we trusted the most pushed us far away . And there is no one road , we should not be the same . But I'm just a ghost and still they < PROPFEMALE > me . They < PROPFEMALE > me in circles . <3 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Sullivan - MY VOICE IS BACK !! :)) It turns out I just need to stress it more often ! 
Sick , again . :/ Stupid immune system . . . 
< PROPFIRST > Lamb- Thanks to your cockroach on plate story ... I am hesitant to EVER go to Nothing but Noodles . :( 
I wont say yes , because I can't let go . No point in asking when my heart is in shatters , but I wont let it show on the outside- And that's because it will only hurt more , knowing it was my fault . But instead of trying to find someone to blame , I know that I'm the bad guy . I know I'm ashamed , because it is eating me alive . Just came to say no , because it is not you . THEY are not you . -And I will always miss you for the person you were and who I was not . 
They don't call it landing in love , because you eventually fall out of it . 
The dumbest thing to say when you're dying : I did this for you . Why ? Because it will make them feel guilty their whole life . 
My voice teacher sings opera . :D hehe 
Listen , why spend your life on love ? It eventually ends when someone moves on , no .. not always . -But don't expect your true love to come around when you're young and stay with you forever ; not everyone HAS a true love that shares that mutual feeling . So wait until you're older , maybe then you can truly decide ..? 
I slept multiple times throughout the day .. I guess I'll just get off my lazy butt and take a shower and make a salad . haha 
I'll be the first to say\ 
That now I'm okay\ 
And for the first time\ 
I've opened up my eyes\ 
This was my worst love\ 
You'll be the first to go\ 
And when she leaves you for dead\ 
You'll be the last to know\ 
~ Three Days Grace 
-'Forget or Remember'-\ 
by : < PROPFEMALE > Sullivan\ 
Keep running because\ 
You still wont get too far . \ 
The shadows\ 
They haunt you . \ 
How shall I remind you\ 
That your fate\ 
Has been sealed ? \ 
Life was a greedful deal . \ 
Life was the hardest steal . \ 
How could you stand\ 
On your feet ? \ 
How could you live\ 
Knowing one day'd\ 
Hold your defeat ? \ 
Tragedies end . \ 
-Rather tragedies wait\ 
For another day\ 
As you dance in your\ 
Selfish rain . \ 
Laugh as you live . \ 
Run fore you die . \ 
Why oh why so shy ? \ 
It has known you for long . \ 
It has haunted your rights\ 
And wrongs . . . \ 
You knew it'd be years\ 
So open your ears\ 
To the sound as we sing . \ 
Like a bell\ 
The voices ring\ 
Through your head . \ 
So just run\ 
Because wherever you turn . \ 
You're not hidden . \ 
Not hidden from us . \ 
Not hidden at all . \ 
Hold onto our hands\ 
So you will not fall . \ 
Fall like a leaf\ 
On the Autumn wind . \ 
Autumn to Winter\ 
A chilling frost\ 
In the year . \ 
-And now we are here . \ 
So dearest young child\ 
Whom is not young at all . \ 
Vintage as a porcelain doll . \ 
Dance as you leap . \ 
Sing as you run . \ 
One day your time will be up . 
Happy Halloween ! 
We get to wear our costumes to school ! Scaring little kids tonight with < PROPFEMALE > . :) 
Applying for the Northwest School of the Arts for High School next year ! If I move back into South < PROPFEMALE > - I'm going into Fort Mill High and applying for the Governer's School of the Arts ! :) 
< PROPMALE > was the sweetest person I've ever known . He was kind , caring , loving , he didn't judge you when you were mad , he didn't judge you at all . I could always be myself around him . And I just wanted him to know that I loved him . I'll never get to tell it to him again , because when he was walking home from school , his life was taken by a car . He had dreams , family , friends , goals . I'll miss you .... <3 
What hurts more is the fact the song \Fix You\ " has been playing through my head and heart . ' Tears go streaming down your face . -When you lose something you can't replace . ' . . . </3 " 
When you try your best , but you don't succeed . When you get what you want but not what you need . When you feel so tired but you can't sleep . Stuck in reverse . And the tears come streaming down your face when you lose something you can't replace . When you love someone , but it goes to waste . -Could it be worse ? Lights will guide you home and ignite your bones .. and I will try to fix you . </3 
I'm not going to school today , I can't do it . They cremated him , his ashes are going over Japan ( Where we said we'd go when we got older , even just as friends . ) , North < PROPFEMALE > and South < PROPFEMALE > , and the place he said he wanted to visit the most .. Iceland . I'll always have a place for you in my heart . <3 
30-40 bucks isn't expensive ...?! WOW DAD . I DON'T HAVE A JOB . -That's pretty darn expensive . ' -___- 
The awkward moment when you think someone's stalking you and you turn around for them to say \You're not that special\ " . . . wtc ? " 
Best lines in a movie ever : \Do you dance with all of your friends ' moms ...? \ " \ " .. Pre-tty much .. \ " * walks away * " 
Can you explain to me why all my old favorite songs , make me cry ? Maybe because they reminded me of you . 
Starting toning and weight loss diet tomorrow . Archery range on Saturday . Apparently due to something that happened on Thursday , I shouldn't be doing any physical activities whatsoever until Monday .. - But oh well , I know what to do if something happens ! :) I can't wait until Summer ! :P 
11:11 Make a wish , though it wont come true , because my only wish was to be with you . </3 
If you're tearing me down to build me up , then you're building me up to tear me down . Why not rip out my heart and through it away , while I unknowingly dance in the rain ? <// 3 
If I confuse you , that means my random is still working . ;) 
Combat boots tehe ~ <3 
Something I find offensive : People asking me if I smoke , ever have smoked , or plan to smoke . <- (Smoke anything , drugs and whatnot . ) One of my friends ( I think it was Meara ) said she liked my voice because it sounded like I'd been smoking for a year and had quit ... Thanks , < PROPFEMALE > , for smoking in the car when I lived with you . :P 
I'm changing my facebook language to French so I'll get over my fear of French people ... 
Saying goodbye is harder than saying I love you ; too bad it couldn't have been the latter . Not that it would really matter , since you wouldn't feel the same . - <// 3 
It hurts when : You fall backwards onto a chair , fall out of the chair ALSO backwards and land on your head to do a somersault .. never try it kids .. 
I'm ugly ! \ 
lms if you disagree <3 \
