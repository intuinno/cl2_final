eh , well ... 

\Who is < PROPMALE > ? Those who are happy with their portion . \ " Think about it . " 
doesn't finding Halloween < PROPFEMALE > months later make you wonder why u even bothered in the first place ? 
so it seems that eating does not lead to happiness for some people 
ha ! CANADIAN FACEBOOK !!! FTW 
VJA + threat of < PROPMALE > not appearing in Yearbook 2010 = < PROPMALE > going to Mokena for senior portraits 
Que sera , sera , no ? 
Finished World War Z : Democratic Decimation = non sehr gut , but effective no ?

Wow . There's alot highlights from band camp . 
Thanks for the b-day wishes 
Summer homework ?! Nooo !!! 
Random acts of kindness may be nice , but random acts of kindness don't make a saint . 
Isn't it funny when the thing you want to have is placed on a silver platter for someone else who never wanted it ? 
If you can't beat ' em ( school ) , then join ' em ( because you have to ) . 
Not to be emo or anything , but the weather is really nice right now . My bright computer screen is complented really well by my shadowy room . Other than that I love the rain . 
Freedom ! Done with ESSAY ! 
Since its inevitable ... I can't wait for school ! :P 
For the greatest gift , what price are you willing to pay ? 
Down and out . 
Not a bad first day . Nice to see old faces in classes . Way too many new faces in AP Gov though , but wth no prob . 
Perseverance , that's the key word ... personally sleep , rest , relax , or anything close would be great substitutes . 
TheStudent : conquering homework , one subject at a time 
>_< hard time concentrating on hw ... senioritis go away !! 
school allows me to have the sense of satisfaction as i complete my subjects one by one :) but then again , school consumes my time which destroys my satisfaction * shakes fist at 4 pg essay 
The greater a man's talents , the greater his power to lead astray . It is better one should suffer than that many should be corrupted . 
MSI + HW 
o_o 
SXU + no essay = YES !!! 
Keep chugging along and don't give an inch , yes ? 
Somnus bonus est .

Well , apparently I can't type \What's on your mind ? \ " on this and share it . " 
OOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIOOOOOOOOOOOOO ( tomorrow at 5 ... and the day after that ... until 4am sunday ... ) 
Filling out a few college aps b4 night falls on me 
;] 
so is blah considered an emotion ? bcause i feel very blah 
Riddle me this : A beggar's brother died , but the man who died had no brother . How could this be ? 
RIDDLE : You arrive at the gate of heaven and hell . Two guardians are here . None of them is seating in front of a particular gate , they are just walking around . One of the gate leads to heaven , the other to hell , and as you might have guessed , you have to find which one . The only thing you know is that one of the guardian is always lying and the other always telling the truth . You can ask one question to one of them . 
one word : dead 
go to school tomorrow ? sure , y not , i'll vegetate just about anywhere anyway >.> 
Mundus vult decipi , ergo decipiatur . 
oddly enough , today was ok ... then again ending the day with pie is always a plus :) 
Even the most graceful-looking swans still thrash their legs underneath . 
too bad jobs dont just fall from the sky ._. 
notifications , should one even bother to sort through if they havent been on for some time ? 
Plebs Demens ?

thinking that im getting old ... its a bit faded , but wasn't there a time < PROPFEMALE > youtube didn't have so much ads ?

et tu , Brute ? 
study for viv's final ? umm ... dunnoo ...

Um , yea . New Year means a clean slate (?) .

saw the Book of < PROPMALE > , and it was amazing . yes , way past the amazingness of Avatar 
the radio tells me that obama made around 450 promises , and kept about 75 while breaking about 75 ... um gj obama , at least you kept it even (?) 
new Domino's pizza ftw 
Strange , I can always trust on chef boyardee to disgust me , yet fill me up , everytime . Power of soggy meat and noodles ??? 
for today , am proud to be part of the going home club 
brave fool or cautious coward , your choice . for me i say that < PROPFEMALE > will lead the way , after all what you reap is what you sow , yes ? and anyways , dumb luck always luv'd the guy who never asked twice :P 
that 30 < PROPFEMALE > nap during math was very relaxing :) 
Back from Model < PROPFEMALE > Field Trip . < PROPMALE > approves and reccomends future applicants to join for further discussion of relevant and unrelevant topics circulating around the world's problems and stuff like that . ;P 
Heart Gold or Soul Silver ? Which one ? 
Ooo ... parents threw another curveball ... 
so , senioritis ... yea ... hopefully that viv hw isnt a turn-in one 
yay , one more quarter to go ... 
What to do to die today in a minute or two to two . I think I simply hard to say I harder still to do . A bea t-t a-ra-tat , a twenty to two , a ra t-t a-ta-ta-ta-ta-two . And the dragon will come when he hears the drum at a minute or two-to-two today , a minute or two-to-two . 
Waiting for the initiative to do Viv essay to kick in ... Btw , is the topic limited to < PROPMALE > Lear ? 
umm ... most of these rpg stuff in facebook are basically the same thing ... 
how does one cure senioritis ? 
coincedences happen more frequently than most people think . for example , middle school presented the yearly \max gets hit in the head with any type of ball\ " event " 
Look at the stars in the country side . There's so many of them that you'd think they're never lonely , but there's always that space between each one . 
Attention . I have nothing to share . Thank you for your time ; that is all . 
Yea , english class outside when the sun isn't beaming too much on u is an amazing thing . Hope we do it again tomorrow :D 
having one of those rare down moments . ah well ... que sera , sera ? 
It's good to learn from your failures . I just prefer to learn from the failures of others . 
Thnx for all those who came out to support to Man Choir . BIG THNX for NHS for setting everything up . :) 
so useless . what do you say when you know the inevitable outcome ? 
So we're all lonely inside , huh ? 
Me thinks that I may be moving to Japan or Korea if the opportunity arises . :/ 
I got my eight hours , how bout you ? 
Random thought : I wish the characters in Pokemon would age already . I grew up with them , and now ... I'm older than them . That reeeaally makes me feel old . O.o 
We say we love flowers , yet \ 
we pluck them . We say we love trees , yet we cut them down . And people \ 
still wonder why some are afraid when told they are loved . 
More fish in the sea , eh ? That's good . I like aquariums .

we shouldn't b too materialistic ... but damn , i need money plz !!!! 
Nothing like clean sheets :D 
I dont remember ... has there been a time where it rained without thunder and lightning in Tinley Park ? 
restarting something that was given alot of time isnt very fullfilling :/ 
After a 5 year hiatus on martial arts , will be learning them once more ! Any suggestions on what I should dive into ? 
FOCUS at SXU tomorrow !!! ( joy ... ) 
its always good to forget how to spell the last names of new friends :/ 
NEWS FLASH !!! ITS Hooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooottttttttttttttttttttttttttt :)

Nomen mihi Legio est , quia multi sumus .

Fate\ 
is funny . Hard work doesn't really ensure that it will pay in the end\ 
like real life has dictated , but , just as the vietcong didn't\ 
surrender , giving up without a fight would shame me . After all , fate might give me a lucky break , like my enemy withdrawing even though I was clearly losing ;P 
List of college experiences I wanted to do : mess up 10% of my grade , and do 2 essays over the night . :D ( not really , ? _ ? )

I have a theory , all Last boss's ? lose the fight BECAUSE \

SITUATION : Small act of good ... * chirp chirp * SITUATION : Small act of evil ... * wtf ?! blah blah ! boom roar swish ! * CONCLUSION : Good people are really underappreciated . People like to pay attention to the wrong things . 
Always depressing to find out a show that u had hype for is a flop . 
I've always heard that to test products animals are sacrificed , meaning they will show the results , which we know as side-effects , by experiencing it themselves . These can be anything from a rash to a full-blown heart attack . Never really thought about it , but it's never good to see it happen - not even in a class lab . Innocents don't deserve to die from an intentional heart attack .
