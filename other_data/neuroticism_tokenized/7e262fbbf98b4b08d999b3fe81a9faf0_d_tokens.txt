Have you had enough folic acid today ?

Did you know that stress physically changes the shape of neurons in your brain , and the changes from chronic stress change the way those neurons fire and talk to each other ? This change in shape and firing pattern is correlated with learning deficits in rats . I think it's really cool . \ 
It's also a reminder to take a deep breath , consider what we have control over , and relax as we go into another semester of classes !
