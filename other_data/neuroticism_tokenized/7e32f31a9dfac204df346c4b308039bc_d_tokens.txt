Question : Why does my box of tea have a fire-breathing dragon with demonic red eyes gazing off into the distance , razor-sharp talons peacefully crossed , while a < PROPFEMALE > in a red dress sits calmly on its back ? These are the things I think about when I can't handle sales calls anymore .

I don't know about anyone else , but what I'm celebrating today is the end of political ads :) Also , with any luck , the death of the Tea Party movement . 
Time for the Republicans to deliver . It'll be interesting to see what gets done in the next two years , because independent voters quickly lose < PROPFEMALE > with both parties when the change they promised doesn't happen .
