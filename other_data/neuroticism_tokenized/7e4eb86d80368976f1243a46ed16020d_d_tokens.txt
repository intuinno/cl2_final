The human rights situation in North Korea is dire . However , the so called politically \left\ " and \ " progressives\ " that are active in South Korea are so blindly committed to pro-North Korean foreign policy that anybody who raises legitimate concerns for the human rights situation in North Korea is automatically stigmatized as an \ " anti-peace\ " \ " war-loving\ " \ " right-wing\ " \ " reactionary \"." 
Most philosophers who try to interpret Hobbes by utilizing game theory gets it wrong , not because they do not know enough about Hobbes , but because they do not know enough about game theory . 
7 : 0 was the final score between Portugal vs . North Korea in the 2010 World Cup . The first half was pretty even ; however , after the second goal , North Korea started to collapse , and that was the beginning of a devastating one-sided beat down . 
OMG !! Fedor experienced his first ever real lost in his whole MMA career to Werdum today !! This is SURREAL ... I always knew that somebody would beat Fedor sometime ; I never knew that person was going to be Werdum who got cut from UFC due to unimpressive performance ... This just broke the facade of invincibility of Fedor , and ,... now , I expect to see more losses from him in the future ...

Hun's cell phone number has been changed to 607-339-3488 ! 
i'm starting to get used to the smartphone environment . i think the epic 4 g is really awesome ! 
I have realized that the Samsung bundle earphones that came with my Epic 4G ( Galaxy S ) sounds remarkably well . ( I thought all bundle earphones sound like crap . ) I would personally have preferred a little bit more low-end . But the highs are really good which makes the music sound very bright and clear .

I think that it is best for Crocop to retire . He has constantly shown that he is no longer relevant . What a lackluster performance ...

is re-ripping his CDs with Apple Lossless Encoder in iTunes . Originally , Hun ripped all of his appoximately 1,500 CDs with a bit rate of 128 kbps 3 years ago . What a pain to re-do this process again !! Hun is starting with his electronica collection first . 
I have a question . I think that there are broadly three types of people : ( a ) people who speak very logically and persuasively , ( b ) people who write very logically and persuasively , and ( c ) people who are very good at standardized tests . \ 
\ 
For now , assume that the three types of people constitute three disjoint sets . If so , which type of people would you regard as \the really\ " smart ones ?? " 
My car has a \no reverse transmission problem\ " which means that it does not go backwards even when my gear is on \ " R\ " and stays at neutral . Does anybody know a good place to fix transmissions in Ithaca ?? "

had a very good time rolling with the guys in the < PROPMALE > Jujitsu Club today . But , he received a warning for slamming people to the mat :( 
I want to see Fedor vs . Velasquez ! 
I just came back home from training with the < PROPMALE > Jujitsu club . The sky is yellow ... and every single muscle in my body is aching . I don't think I would need to do any additional conditioning if I do this regularly . 
I just received my copy of EA MMA . I played a couple of hours , and I think that it is great ! In career mode , it really makes you feel what it is like to live a life of a MMA fighter . Very realistic ... and you get to train with Bas Rutten !!

I have always believed that philosophy should strive to be precise rather than profound . 
Okay . UFC 123 ... I've already put $50 on Rampage at +220 and I am waiting to put some on < PROPMALE > Hughes . The line for Hughes is currently rising . I think I'll grab it when it nears +180 at Bodog . 
is comtemplating on what kind of toys he should buy on Black Friday . 
What is the best way to take out < PROPFIRST > Jong-il by minimizing unnecessary casualities both military and civilian ??

WTF < PROPFEMALE > ?! 
I am at Teagle and i can realize that I've significantly gotten weaker over the Thanksgiving break . A week off of weight training definitely makes a difference . 
Which is Philosophy closer to ? English literature or Mathematics ? Which should philosophy be closer to ? 
Hun just ordered from Papa < PROPFIRST>'s Pizza on Campusfood.com http://bit.ly/bdoHHt 
If you buy a laptop in korea which operates in windows 7 home edition , does the windows 7 come with a fully installed Korean language pack ? 
I have been missing some of my packages lately and I started to feel that they were not just simple delivery accidents but were due to some \sticky fingers\ " when the landlord brought one of my \ " already opened\ " packages which he said he discovered from the laundry room . "

My mom told me that my grandfather passed away yesterday . It was about a month ago when we discovered that my grand father discovered had cancer . And , after that , everything was so quick . I thought that my grandfather would , at least , be alive for my wedding . It just makes me ponder about the old question : what is the meaning of life and death ?

My Pics for UFC 126 : ( 1 ) Jones + < PROPMALE > ( 2-way Parlay ) , and ( 2 ) < PROPFEMALE > vs . Belfort won't complete 4 full rounds . If I get both right , I win about $200 . Let's wait and see . 
Fedor got battered , lost by doctor stoppage , and announced retirement . Two drops of tear passed my cheek while I was watching all of this live . 
Why am I writing one sentence of my dissertation , and , then , writing five random comments on other people's facebook ?? I think that I would have , by far , finished writing my dissertation if the process was the other way around . 
Happy Birthday to ME !! Hahaha !

I have mentioned this to many of my friends , but , after watching < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > es defeat < PROPFIRST > Bader at UFC 126 , I seriously started to think that it is utterly unfair for < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > es to fight anybody in the light heavyweight division . Today's fight proved that my assessment was accurate . 
Right now , I should be in my plane flying back to Korea . Instead , I am in the emergency room in a hospital near JFK International Airport waiting to get stiches on my forehead . What a long and awful day ! 
I have safely arrived at South Korea . What a long trip !
