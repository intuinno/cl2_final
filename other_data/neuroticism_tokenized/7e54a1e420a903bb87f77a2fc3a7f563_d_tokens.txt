Three Weeks ! Woo Hoo ! Wooooooooo Hooooooooo ! 
Two weeks Two weeks Two weeks Two weeks Two weeks Two weeks Two weeks Two weeks Two weeks Two weeks Two weeks Two weeks 
NINE DAYS ! 
SIX DAYS ! 
Yes , we are playing the Gerudo Valley Theme while cutting the cake . Not the < PROPFIRST > theme , I know , but still Nintendo ! :) ( in a singsong voice : \Neeeeerds ! \")" 
is MARRIED ! 
Canada , here we come ! 
Holy Crap so much to do ! 
is very thankful for all the birthday wishes , and is also very thankful for a sneaky husband who can plan a surprise birthday dinner with a bunch of my friends ( and an ice cream cake ! ) :) 
Heavy rain => leaks => call for a work order => they \fix\ " it => heavy rain => leaks ?!? = I can't wait to move in two months ... " 
Meetings ALL day ! * sarcastic YAY * 
wants to move it move it ... to a new apartment ! ( not soon enough ) 
Soooo many boxes ! 
New Address ! 6715B Overton Circle , Apartment 24 , < PROPMALE > , MD 21703 
FACEBOOK EXPERIMENT : If you are reading this , whether we do or do not speak often , post a comment of the first memory you have of me that pops in your head . When you've finished , post this paragraph on your own status . You'll be surprised what people remember about you ..... this is gonna be interesting ...... 
Friday ! then Saturday ! Then Sunday ! ( I know a weekend when I see one ) 
Goodness . Tomorrow is Monday . I suppose I should write down my objectives for the week ... 
I just finished loading 14 videos , mainly about < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > , with a bit of < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > thrown in . Enjoy , whilst I fall into bed ... since it is about 2 hours past my bedtime >.< 
So if you are watching the videos of the twins ... switch to regular quality , because the high quality version is incredibly choppy and obnoxious to watch ! Dear Facebook ... Let the cuteness run smoothly , please ... 
THE FACEBOOK TRICK : press up , up , down , down , left , right , left , right , B , A , Enter key , then right click then press up and down , then scroll the < PROPFEMALE > and magic crcles will appear . the only way to get rid of them are to log off or refresh the < PROPFEMALE > ... IT WILL WORK ! put this as your status if it works . Weird ! It definitely worked though . 
My inner web programmer is slowly emerging ... like a caterpillar that accidentally took a horse tranquilizer before becoming a butterfly ... 
SNOW SNOW SNOW SNOW SNOW SNOW SNOW SNOW SNOW 
Haha the quiz I just took said I should be teaching third to fifth grade ... that's a relief , now that Facebook has confirmed my career choice for me ! * wanders off to organize papers to grade * 
Woah . Totally didn't see the snow until just now ! 
Ok . NOW I am grading papers ... 
-All- we need is $700 worth of IKEA gift cards , and then we can go shopping ! :/ 
NO SCHOOL ON MONDAY ! :) :) :) 
Holy Cow . I am ACTUALLY getting some grading done ! This calls for a break ... 
Going to see < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST>'s Ferngully ... I mean ... Avatar ... tonight ! in 3-D ! 
Wait , what ? I am caught up on grading ? * looks around suspiciously ... * Ok , where is the next vicious stack of papers hiding ??? I KNOW YOU ARE OUT THERE SOMEWHERE ! >.< 
Guh . Still working on the final wedding video . It is sooooooo sloooooooow . But once it is DONE , I will be able to post all three , and THEN put all the pictures up ! 
No school for < PROPMALE > County Public Schools on Tuesday . Blah . There goes another day before MSA ... 
Hmmmm , grading papers ... or working on my final wedding video ... tough choice ... >.> <.< * starts up my video editor * 
Huh . Schools closed for the rest of the week . There goes some of Spring Break AND more of SUMMER . >.< 
With all of this snow and ice , don't you WISH you had approximately 45 minutes of video to watch ? Additionally , don't you wish you could see the result of my hard work in regards to compiling and editing my wedding videos ? Well then , you are in luck ! On the exact 7 month anniversary of my wedding , I have finished my videos , and now present them for you to view , if desired , in my video section ! 
My apartment smells like bacon :) 
Hrmph . To spite you snow , I am going to meet with my team tomorrow , to figure out what we can do with what little time is remaining before MSA ... We are ready to slice and dice the curriculum like never before ! Mwhahahaha ... 
Back in business ! Two hour delay tomorrow , rather than a day off :) 
My goodness ... I can't feel my hands anymore after all that tagging ! I am going to take a break until Saturday before uploading the main event ... 
Hmmmm now it makes sense why my upload failed over and over and over ... my pictures are too high quality ... time to reduce ! 
Only two more albums to go ! Done for today though ... 
Ugh . It feels like someone overfilled my head with air . 
I feel like I've been hit with a truck . A truck with a truck inside of it . More specifically , a truck that is really big and stuff . Ok , I think it is time for some Nyquil ... 
Hmmmm , coughing has replaced the fever ... dangit . This appears to be a case of a cold piggybacking on the tail end of my last cold , which I don't think is very fair . Someone should write a stern letter of condemnation to the disease that is currently annoying me . Any volunteers ? 
Totally had to sketch out my week in Word , since I never took my planning materials home with me this weekend due to the last minute sick days ! 
TAXES ARE DONE ! And , we are quite happy with the results . Yay for spending money on tuition that later helps get credit ! 
If you got a random email from me , it was not sent by me , and I wouldn't recommend opening the link . Sorry for the inconvenience ! 
Bad : < PROPMALE > has a 15 < PROPFEMALE > paper to write . Better : We found out it was a group paper , so he wouldn't have to do as much on his own . Best : The group leader assigned him the revision and editing of the parts that everyone else will write , and he is responsible for the accompanying Power Point . Praise the Lord ! 
I totally just figured out that clicking the scroll wheel opens links in a new tab automatically ! Yes , I'm a nerd . 
Made it to NC , took the Fit anyway , with packing tape over the window ! Classy , I know :) Also I got to get my feet wet in the ocean !!! 
Supermariocrossover.com - a must-play for any fan of old school NES games :) 
FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEDOOOOOOOOM ! After having my foot stepped on and trash thrown at me ( by the same student ) , I had no problem relegating him to the office while the rest of us enjoyed our luau and the hectic last day of school . Sweet sweet summer ... though I am now solidly into 7 of my 11 credits for this summer ... yeesh . 
Summer ! Actually quite productive ... went grocery shopping with the hubby , laundry is running , doctor AND dentist appointments made , < PROPMALE > applied to another job whilst we wait to hear back from IBM , and soon grad work shall be worked upon ! 
Oh good ! The rumor that cookie monster is now veggie monster is false ! I was scared for awhile ... 
The downside of living in a building with a keypad entry is that a UPS delivery man with a low IQ doesn't know how to get the code from the main office to complete a delivery ! Then we get to find a sticker slapped on the OUTSIDE door saying we were unable to accept the delivery , even though we were home ! I would think the problem resides with us , IF we haven't already gotten UPS deliveries since we moved here . 
This is the funniest reaction to the earthquake : \The confusion following Friday's quake led to some misplaced theories\ 
I need some input ! I want to start up my own blog ( no specific theme , necessarily ) and I am stuck on a title . Suggestions thus far have included \Shelby's Schtuff\ " and \ " Loquacious Little One\ " . I wanted some more input before making a decision . Any ideas ? " 
Another niece or nephew is coming ! Congratulations < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > ! :) :) 
Woo ! I know I got an A in one of my grad classes . Waiting for the other one , any day now ... Oh look . Approaching midnight . Sentence Fragments . Bluh . * zzzzzzz * 
Sneaky junk mail ... I opened my mailbox to find what convincingly looked like a wedding invitation or a fancy party invitation , and upon opening it , I discovered that I was invited to save lots of money with a new phone service . Dangit . 
Hmmmmm Google Voice . Free domestic calls to phones . Interesting ! I don't know if that will last for long . Interesting . 
Hmmmm . Things have been working out fortuitously for me ... I forgot to set my alarm last night so I woke up late this morning , but I had taken a shower already late last night because of boot camp so I wasn't ACTUALLY late ... and then I forgot to eat my frozen grapes at lunch , which meant I had a cold snack to eat on my way to a class this afternoon , so I didn't end up melting in the incredibly heated car ... nice . 
Conversation during our class meeting today , using fake names , of course :\ 
Student #1 : I don't like it when < PROPMALE > calls me a baby hippo . \ 
( I look to the other student for an explanation)\ 
Student #2 : Well , her front teeth look like hippo teeth ... \ 
( Student #1 begins to cry)\ 
(* MENTAL FACEPALM*)\ 
\ 
Oh Fridays ... 
Wow . I just re-watched the movie I had made for my college friends at the end of our college career . It's a keeper . Very entertaining ! 
After having my favorite breakfast ( Cheerios with a banana sliced on top ) it's now time to go on a walk with my hubby ! :D 
In order to quote my sister : \So\ 
Is it just me , or does rain make you sleepy ? It certainly makes it difficult to get out of bed ! 
Good thing my internal clock remembered that I have to get up for work , because my alarm wasn't set and the volume was way down ... 
I am too curious to pass this one up ... \ 
If you're reading this , even if we don't speak often , please post a comment of a memory of you and I . When you've finished , post this paragraph on your own status , you'll be surprised what people remember about you . 
< PROPMALE>'s maternal grandfather , Papa Pipe , passed away this past Sunday . I had been waiting to post something on Facebook until I could find the best phrasing to honor him , but the loss has left me without the words I am so accustomed to having at a moment's notice . We miss him dearly , though we are grateful the end was so peaceful . 
Halloween ! 
So , I am an insane person , and I am going to see < PROPMALE > Potter on opening night in < PROPMALE > , next Friday , November 19th , at 7:30 pm with a few other people . If you are brave enough to join me , let me know by Monday so I can pick up a ticket for you ahead of time , and then you can pay me back on Friday . 
Went to see < PROPMALE > Potter last night with two awesome Willoughbys , preceded by eating a container of fresh raspberries and followed by a hangout at IHOP . That was a good evening ! 
My husband made me orange rolls for breakfast this morning ! I do so enjoy half days of school ... :) 
So , after quite a long day at school , with evening parent conferences , I come home to a clean kitchen , an artichoke almost done cooking , my slippers laid out , the song we had for our first dance at our wedding playing in the background , and a happy husband , ready to slow dance . \ 
* happy sigh * 
Christmas tree assembled , decorations are up , photo cards are ordered , Christmas music has been played ... Yeah , it's December 1st ! Woo ! 
Oh lookee here ... six inches of hair are gone ... 
That was a lot of grading . Time to sleep ! 
Liberal Leave is in effect , so 10 month teachers stay home ! Woo ! 
Did ANYONE in < PROPMALE > get snow ? 
Remind me to check the FCPS website BEFORE getting my bowl of cereal ready ... Normally I am signed up for the Find Out First email , but evidently it's the Find Out Last email today . >.< 
Dear God , \ 
I know I talk too much on a regular basis , but could I please have my voice back ? It would be quite helpful for the full week of school that is coming up ... Thanks ! \ 
Silently yours , \ 
< PROPFEMALE > 
Wow . That was some ice storm . \ 
>.< \ 
Here comes the rain ... 
Football is the one with the nets , right ? 
Mmmm a spoonful of raw < PROPFEMALE > should coax my voice back . Even if it doesn't work , at least I got to eat a spoonful of < PROPFEMALE > ! Win/win 
Homemade spaghetti with Italian sausage , a dozen roses , and 27 Dresses ( the movie , of course ) . Yes please ! Happy < PROPFIRST>'s Day everyone ! 
Laser Tag and Spaghetti Dinner Extravaganza ... success ! Tons of food , friends , and fun ! I'm glad we're off tomorrow so I can recover ... 
Mmmmmm GogiBop ... http://www.gogibop.com/ 
Mmmm homemade banana-chocolate milkshake . Just what the doctor ordered . Except there was no doctor . Because I just wanted a banana-chocolate milkshake . So I made one . \ 
And it is delicious . 
16 < PROPFEMALE > District Technology Training Plan for graduate class ? \ 
Oh that ? \ 
Yeah that's turned in . And even 4 hours before the cutoff time ! I'm so proud of myself ! \ 
* sniff*\ 
* wipes tear from cheek * 
Just got back from visiting my grandmother . She is not doing well at all . :( \ 
Please keep her and my family in your thoughts and prayers . 
Snow , snow , go away ... come again another day ( like seriously , next winter ) ... 
They are moving my grandmother from the physical rehabilitation center back to her home so Hospice can take over . She is not very responsive , but at least she is comfortable , which is the goal . I got her to smile tonight . :) 
Definitely had no idea that it was daylight savings time ! Thank goodness my iPod and phone automatically adjusted ! 
Watching her slip away is the worst part ... 
My grandmother passed away this afternoon . She is finally at peace . \ 
Goodbye , birthday < PROPMALE > . :( 
My awesome husband made fried rice , from scratch , in a WOK . Yum !
