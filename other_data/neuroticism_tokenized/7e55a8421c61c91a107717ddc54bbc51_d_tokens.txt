16 HOURS of nothing but Brainy Baby movies .... REEE-FUSED to watch Disney movies of any sort ... If I have to liesten to ' What color is this ?? Let's count to 10 ! or Leaf/Oha one more time , I'm going to pull my hair out !!!! 

Surgery for < PROPFIRST>'s central IV line went well today , and tomorrow is the big move to the Medical Center . Hopefully , in a few short weeks , we can finally have < PROPFIRST > HOME !!!!! 
Finally at the Med Center ... I'm not sure what to do now ... 
< PROPFIRST > is getting another blood tranfusion tonight :( ... but , if everything goes well ... we will be going home next week ... no cordless model yet , but , still home !!! 
We had such a good day with our friends Tyeson and Maddox !!! < PROPFIRST > hadn't seen them since they left the NICU . Thanks < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > !!! 
Sitting with < PROPFIRST > , watching Cars , trying to figure out how he can do certain things at such a young age . I.E. surgical procedures ... dismember feeding tubes ... remove g-button ... how in the HELL ??? 
dehydration , by definition , is a shitty way to spend the weekend . No pun intended ! 
Excited that I finally have my little boy home for the very first time !!! Welcome home < PROPFIRST > !!!! 
Strained baby carrots are disgusting ... why the hell am I feeding these to < PROPFIRST > ?? 
Nap time is my favorite time of the day !!! 
How does one get green beans up their nose and have to clean them out with a q-tip ? I mean , honestly !?!?! 
I've yet to master pointing the oohoo down ... I'm so tired of being pee'd on !! One of us does not find this funny !! 
Had fun at < PROPFIRST>'s birthday this afternoon . < PROPFIRST > is turning into quite the party animal !! We slept in to 1 this afternoon !!! 
Finally got my first giggle out of Logan ... I think I scared him though , because I haven't gotten one since !!! 
It's 2:40 in the morning , and < PROPFIRST > is still grunting . Poor little boy .. we'll fix your tummy soon , I promise Peanut !! 
Anxious for the endoscopy tomorrow ... I wonder what we will find out ... 
I'm in deep ... Logan know's that my name is ' muummm ' ... 
It's a busy weekend . First visiting in < PROPFEMALE > , and this afternoon ... off to Creston to see our friend , < PROPFEMALE > !! Can't wait !! 
< PROPFIRST > has a new girlfriend !! He held < PROPFEMALE>'s hand and played footsey !! Little stinker !! 
I actually cried this morning ... I can see < PROPFIRST>'s first tooth coming in ... my little boy is getting so big .. where the hell has the time gone ??? 
This is SUCH a big weekend for us !! < PROPFIRST > has finally rolled over by himself , and now , all he wants to do is roll !! What's next ?? Don't tell me .. I don't think I can handle that !! 
One tooth , two theeth , rolling ... oh my !! 
I've discovered 4 teeth now !!! Tomorrow is 9 months ... yea < PROPFIRST > !!! 
Back in the hospital ... Joggity Jog . OOhhh ... someone up here has toast .. that smells good ... 
We are back in the hospital because < PROPFIRST > got sick yesterday and we had to make a trip back up here . They think that he might have a line infection . We are just waiting to see what the lab tests show !! 
No line infection ... YEA !!! My two favorite boys will be home tomorrow !!! WWHOOOHOOOO !!! 
Peanut is supposed to be napping ... however ... he would rather talk about this . He's not winning his argument !! 
Back in the hospital with a fever of 105 ..... my poor Peanut ... hopefully we'll get to go home soon !!! 
After 5 days in Maryville's hospital , it's time to transfer < PROPFIRST > to Omaha .... he's just not getting better .... * sniff sniff * ... 
< PROPFIRST>'s finally home and back to normal !!! Yea Peanut !!!! 
Apparently , the only thing that < PROPFIRST > is able to say right now is ' MMMMMMMUUUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMAA !! Have we lost the ability to say ' ah-dad' ?? 
Just went out for our first Trick or Treating !! < PROPFIRST > was less than impressed with his turtle costume ... but he was SOOO cute !!! 
rgt5cvfvbgbfvrdxc fvg xcx bnn fvzxv hnrfgvwcfvbn g vcvx n < PROPFIRST > wanted to add his own update !! 
I am the walrus ... koo koo kachoo !!! 
' ... we don't need no concert in the city ... I got a stereo and the best of < PROPFEMALE > Cline ... ' -oohhh ... I do love me some Hooty !! 
at 12:30 in the morning ... I have a whole new appreciation for the People of Walmart ... 
Does anybody know how to make a cake in the shape of a peanut ?? The boy with no neck is requesting one , and I don't like to dissapoint ... 
la la < PROPFEMALE > , la la < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST>'s song .... la la < PROPFEMALE > , la la < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST>'s song ... 
< PROPFIRST>'s a great little shopper and got his picture taken with < PROPFEMALE > today !!! Good times Peanut !! 
Is wondering when < PROPFIRST > is going to give up the fight , stop pinching my arm , and take a nap ?? 
Is anxious to teach < PROPFIRST > the value and importance of our Vetrans !!! Happy Vetrans Day !! 
We've discovered our voice ... and it's LOUD !!! There's something about hearing MOOOM at the top of his lungs that just does something to me ... I'll think about what I should label it as ... 
I'll be your Huckelberry ... you sure can Val ... you sure can !! 
< PROPFIRST > helped with proving up tonight and we passed !! Thanks < PROPFIRST > !!!!! 
< PROPFIRST > had a blast at the Bite of Bedford ... he met a lot of people and helped pass out caramel corn , but not the hot chocolate ... he was not allowed near the hot water !! 
Starting the big countdown ... 
I can't believe that my little boy is a year old ... where has my year gone ?? 
< PROPFIRST > : You surprised to see us , < PROPMALE > ? < PROPMALE > : Oh , < PROPFIRST > ... If I woke up tomorrow with my head sewn to the carpet , I wouldn't be more surprised than I am now . 
< PROPFEMALE > Sue : < PROPMALE > bit my thumb . Him's nervous . Clark : Nervous or excited ? < PROPFEMALE > Sue : Shittin ' bricks . Clark : You shouldn't use that word . < PROPFEMALE > Sue : Sorry . Shittin ' rocks 
Ellen : Oh Aunt < PROPFEMALE > , you shouldn't have done that . Aunt < PROPFEMALE > : Oh dear , did I break wind ? Uncle Lewis : Jesus , did the room clear out , < PROPFEMALE > ? Hell no , she means presents . You shouldn't have brought presents . 
< PROPFEMALE > : Don't throw me down < PROPMALE > . < PROPMALE > : I'll try not to Aunt < PROPFEMALE > ... 
Bethany : Do you hear that ... it's a funny squeaky sound . Louis : You couldn't hear a dump truck driving through a nitroglycerin plant ! 
Clark : This is a full-blown , four-alarm holiday emergency here . We're gonna press on , and we're gonna have the hap , hap , happiest Christmas since Bing Crosby tap-danced with < PROPMALE > fucking < PROPFEMALE > . And when < PROPFEMALE > squeezes his fat white ass down that chimney tonight , he's gonna find the jolliest bunch of assholes this side of the nuthouse . 
Clark : < PROPFEMALE > Christmas . < PROPFEMALE > Christmas , < PROPFEMALE > Christmas , < PROPFEMALE > Christmas , kiss my ass . Kiss his ass . Kiss your ass . Happy Hanukkah . 
Frances : Talk about pissing your money away . I hope you kids see what a silly waste of resources this was . Audrey : He worked really hard , Grandma . Art : So do washing machines . 
< PROPFEMALE > : < PROPMALE > , I think it'd be best if everyone went home ... before things get worse . < PROPMALE > : WORSE ? How could things get any worse ? Take a look around here , < PROPFEMALE > . We're at the threshold of hell . 
< PROPMALE > : You got a kiss for me ? Eddie : Better take a rain check on that , < PROPMALE > - he's got a lip fungus they ain't identified yet ! 
Clark : Hey ! If any of you are looking for any last-minute gift ideas for me , I have one . I'd like < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > , my boss , right here tonight . I want him brought from his happy holiday slumber over there on < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > with all the other < PROPMALE > people and I want him brought right here , with a big ribbon on his head ... 
and I want to look him straight in the eye and I want to tell him what a cheap , lying , no-good , rotten , four-flushing , low-life , snake-licking , dirt-eating , inbred , overstuffed , ignorant , blood-sucking , dog-kissing , brainless , dickless , hopeless , heartless , fat-ass , bug-eyed , stiff-legged , spotty-lipped , worm-headed sack of monkey shit he is ! Hallelujah ! Holy shit ! Where's the Tylenol ? 
Off to Texas tomorrow for Christmas ... this is going to be an interesting drive ... I think I'm going to love whoever invented the portable dvd player ... 
I'm so tired of the snow , and more tired of the snow drifts ... make it go away , ok !?! 
I should probably clean today , but , I just really don't feel like it ... 
This afternoon was spent trying to keep Tucker off of the couch , trying to keep < PROPFIRST > on the couch , and trying to keep both of them out of the trash can ... oye !! 
rgsxgjguoiljrydcadbcmbhiu76rteds nX76hn6xcscg4fgv 
Where has time gone ... we're trying REALLY hard to walk ... AAHHHHHHH !!! 
No more TPNs !!! Whoohoo !! What a big boy !!! We are so proud of you Peanut !!! 
Just waiting for results now ... we have low grade fevers and a nasty cough , but otherwise .. seem to be ok ... let's see what tomorrow brings ... 
Now that < PROPFIRST > has his own backpack to < PROPFEMALE > his milk around when he's crawling ... I can't keep up with him . All night I was looking for him and telling him to stay out of something ... he's not old enough for this yet ... is he ?????? 
Dear Winter ... I'm breaking up wtih you ... it's not me , it's you . You make me miserable . I think I need to see other seasons ... 
To the cold that's settled in my chest ... don't get comfortable there .. I'm kicking your ass out as soon as I can figure out a way to make you leave !! 
I really wonder what < PROPFIRST > says to himself when he wakes up in the morning and just talks to himself in his crib ... whatever it is .. it must be really good .. I think he answers himself !! 
Chocolate chocolate everywhere ... is Lent over yet ???? Next year ... we're giving something up that's not so hard to ignore ... 
Do all three year olds have one obnoviosuly loud volume level ???? I guess one hasn't mastered the inside voice yet !!! 
' Well I was drunk .. the day my mom got out of prison ... and I went , to pick her up , in the rain ... but before I could could get to the station in my pick-up truck ... she got runned over by a damned old train ... and I'll < PROPFEMALE > around , as long as you will let me ... ' 
Finally got a FABULOUS nurse who's got < PROPFIRST > eating soft foods and drinking out of a sippy cup !!! WHOOHOO !!!! 
What an exciting week !! We took our first big boy bath last night in the bath tub !! Worried about the central line the whole time , but , so far , so good ! Splashing in an inch of water does a little boy some good ... 
Thanks for all the birthday wishes ... Ben and I got to go out on our first date since < PROPFIRST > was born !! It was a lot of fun for just the two of us to be able to get out of the house !! 
Thinking of Kaylee ... hope you feel better sweetheart !!! We miss you !! 
Congrats on winning your first race of the season Joe ... looks like < PROPFEMALE > is our lucky charm .. winning a race AND getting my Peanut to eat 4 ounces of cereal !!! What a crazy Friday !!! WHOOHOO !! 
Some people are just worthless assholes !! Adre and Kev ... I'm SOOO sorry ... wish there was some way I could help !!! Love y'all!!!!!!!!!! 
Walking barefoot on a shop floor is not conducive to clean feet !!! 
The gin bucket was soooooo yummy in my tummy .... let's do it again < PROPFEMALE > !!!! 
Just watched The Blind Side ... FABULOUS movie ... now on to Blast from the Past .. that'll do !! 
It's funny how the little pitter-patter of feet and an uncontrolable giggle seems to make all your problems go away .... thanks Peanut !! 
Got to meet Ailvia < PROPMALE > for the first time today !!! What a CUTIE !!! She's beautiful !! I can't wait for < PROPFEMALE > , Alivia and < PROPFIRST > to play together !!!! 
not sure what to think of < PROPFIRST > opening a can of Mt . Dew by himself because he felt the need to be naughty . Ive created a monster !! e 
Apparently ... kitties say ' wooo wooo wooo ' . No Peanut ... that's what puppy's say ... oh that little boy cracks me up .. where do they come up with this stuff ?? 
Happy Mother's Day to all the mommy's out there !!! Hope everyone had a good day !!! 
taking < PROPFIRST > to the hospital . Weve been up throwing up since 6 this morning . cross your fingers for no line infections !!! 
no line infection ! slightly dehydrated and a small blockage this morning . on our way home ! thanks for the thoughts !! 
Hopefully it will be nice tomorrow so we can go play in the park ... I need some good play time to wear a certain little boy out for bedtime !!! We haven't been keeping our appointments with the back of our eyelids ... 
Anxiously waiting to see the season finale of Grey's ... 
im in shock ... THATS how they left greys ? holy buckets !!! 
well maybe we should tell that to rainmain . he practically bankrupt a casino and he was a ritard 
note to self .. no more laying out . having a burnt ass is not fun and being hit in the back of the leg from little people hurts . a LOT .. 
i dont want to slap you i just want to high five your face ( quote per < PROPFEMALE > ) that girl cracks me up !! 
Why is that guys have to argue about everything ? When it comes to certain things , I do know what I'm talking about ... gggrrrrrrrrrrrrr .... 
Settled into the Lied ... what ass clown decided that we need to check in at 6 tomorrow ??? Endoscopy at 7:30 and hopefully some results !! 
To the makers of Dove Mint ice cream ... from somewhere in the middle of my tummy , thank you for the layer of chocolate on top . Also , thanks for not making mint ice cream green ... for some reason , it kinda weirds me out . Doesn't stop me from eating it though ... 
< PROPFIRST>'s in surgery and doing great . We are removing granulation tissue around his g-button and putting in a bigger one , removing a stitch from his central line , doing an endoscopy , and a biopsy from his intestines . He's in excellent hands , and has got some good drugs ... good luck Peanut !!! 
< PROPFIRST>'s all checked into UNMC .. again ... his g-button is infected and the antibiotics that he was given have caused A LOT of large diapers . Want to make sure the he doesn't get dehydrated ... will this week ever end !?!?!?! 
Got our problems figured out . Staph Aureus growing in tummy , so , NEW antibiotics for that ... bigger g-button , and more fluids over the next few days . The hiney is still very broken down but , I just signed discharge paperwork , and we will bust out of here once we get the new fluids !!! Thanks for the thoughts and prayers !! They worked to finally get the answers that we need !!!! * Pfew * 
Vanilla ice cream and Hershey's syrup .... yummy in my tummy .... take me back 
Back in Omaha ... woke up with 102.7 fever and uber fussy . Now it's down to 100.7 and still fussy , but , blood work has been negative all day long ... Maybe Texas Children's will find something for us in a few weeks .... 
Maryville's blood work came back with gram positive bacteria growing on < PROPFIRST>'s central line . It's official ... we've got our first line infection . Look's like I will be spending the 4th up here . < PROPFEMALE>'s see what UNMC's blood work grows ... 
' Lover , lover , lover ... you don't treat me no good no more ' ... it just makes me want to jam out to the Bellamy Brothers for a while ... I think I will while I wait for doctors to come do rounds ... 
UNMC's blood work is still pending , but , so far , nothing is growing . So , was it a real line infection ?? I don't know . But , soonest we would get out of here would be tomorrow , but , Dr. Hottie thinks we will stay at least until the blood work grows out for 72 hours . 
UNMC's blood work has come back positive . That means we do have a real line infection . The good news is that < PROPFIRST>'s not showing any signs of being sick , so , we might not have to have surgery to pull the line . I will be in serious need of a back rub when this is all done ... damn hospital chairs 
A certain little boy , who shall remain nameless , keeps sitting up , looking at me , and giggling when he should be sleeping . I know School of Rock is enthralling , and watchin < PROPFIRST > Cusaick ' hand dance ' to a < PROPFIRST > Nicks classic is hard to pull away from !! 
What a dreary day ... I was completely bored until I found the play room down the hall ... JACKPOT !!! 
Not sure why there were 3 cops down the hall from < PROPFIRST>'s room on the Pediatric floor , but , kidna creepy ... met another family with IRP ... their little girl is SOOOOO cute !!!! 
What a fun night ... Jodi , < PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > came up and we went and had dinner , drove go-carts , saw Grown Ups , and watched the fireworks ... who had fun ??? This girl did ... WHOOHOO !!! The only thing that would have made it perfect was to have < PROPFIRST > with us ... 
Finally have an answer ... we have a staph infection growing in < PROPFIRST>'s central line . We have no plans for being discharged any time soon , so , I suppose I should just get comfy here . 
We need to get the hell out of here ... I don't think we can handle another day ... at least I have Family Guy to look forward to ... 
Whatever ... all I have to say is whatever .... 
Surgery tomorrow .. I can't for us to get the hell out of here !!! 
Putting in a new central line tomorrow . With his line being in for over a year , ( YEA go us !! ) and already having an infection , it needed to come out . This will be surgery number 10 ... hopefully .. we will be able to get out of here ... then , Texas in August !! 
all done , and getting ready to come home .. who wants to feed the fishies ... WE DO !!! 
I have a little piglet at home now ! There's not much he won't shove into his mouth ... holy buckets kiddo !!! It's not all edible !! 
To my wonderful Logan ... ' go away , stinky butt , and no ' are not things that a mommy wants to hear ... 
Just got back from Texas Children's ... doing a test on Monday that has never been done on < PROPFIRST > before ... had an awesome family dinner last night , and crawfish tomorrow on the coast !!! Can't WAIT !!! 
Had dinner tonight at Bennihana's with my awesome brother and SIL and the Hubs ... can't wait to < PROPFEMALE > out Sunday . Tomorrow ... taking < PROPFIRST > out into the Gulf for the first time !!! Monday ... a test to see how long it takes < PROPFIRST>'s tummy to empty out . Maybe shed some light onto why we can go 6 hours without a diaper and then BAM .. 
To the three pounds of crawfish that are in my tummy ... props for being so yummy !! Fishing tomorrow in the Gulf , and then on to Kevin's ... Chris ... you better be there to have a beer or two with !! 
The test was .... well ... long . We sat in the wrong place for over an hour because no one told us where we needed to be , then , the test took an hour and a half . I should get results tomorrow on how everything worked ... While I wait .. Ikea .. here I come !!! 
Made it home safe and sound ... now , we need to get back into our routine ... I don't do change very well .. but , super excited about the new Ikea additions to my house !! Thanks Kev !!! 
All registered for the NICU reunion next month !!! I can't wait to see all the extended family that helped us through sooo much . And ... can't wait to see all of our friends that were in there with us !!! It seems like so long ago , but , the memories are still fresh !! Can't wait !!!! 
Ok ... Halloween costume time ... I have it down to 4 different ideas ... help me pick !! We have ...... Yoda , a Smurf , < PROPMALE > the Frog , or a doctor . I thought I had it figured out , but , I'm not so sure now ... 
The circus is in town , and I just can't bring myself to take < PROPFIRST > . I think it has something to do with this unnatural fear I have of clowns ... sorry kiddo . 
It's official ... The Yoda's have it . May the Force be with you < PROPFIRST > !! 
Birthday dinner for Jodi ... had a BLAST !!! Happy Birthday my dear !! LOVE YA !!! 
Our good friend Tyeson , who is < PROPFIRST>'s age , is having surgery Friday . Please pray that everything goes well , and pray for his mom and dad . This is their first time doing surgery and a little nervous !!! Good luck guys ... we love you and know it will turn out fine !!!! 
Tyeson's surgery went well !!! Mommy and daddy are doing great , and Tye was such a big boy !!! Thanks for the prayers !! Can't wait to play with them next week at the NICU reunion !!! 
Master Yoda is excited to see all his friends at the NICU reunion ... it'll be a nice break for the parental units to get together !!! 
Had a BLAST at the NICU reunion !! So glad to see all of our friends , and especially the Miller's!!! Can't wait to see everyone again !!! 
Finally catching up on Grey's and Private Practice ... I can't wait to see what happened last week ... WHO misses the season premier !?!?!?!? 
Why is it that someone can piss you off with just a look and a simple comment ??? 
I think we will have to have several dress rehearsals for Halloween ... Logan was NOT impressed with Yoda ... 
I think I've found my new love ... it's the Red < PROPFEMALE > Cheesecake at Three Fires Diner ... Jennifer ... it's still AMAZING !!!!! 
Can't wait for the parade today !!! Go Bulldogs !!!!! 
Had a BLAST at the parade !!! < PROPFIRST > threw < PROPFEMALE > at everyone and was ready to go home with Melly for a nap ... GO DAWGS !!! 
Dear Central line ... Logan and I have discussed this , and you are no longer welcome . You cause nothing but problems , and we feel that you need to leave . Get your affairs in order , and please remove yourself soon . Your services are no longer needed ! Sincerely ... The Mothership 
< PROPFIRST>'s back in the hospital . I spent the day in the ER because he hadn't pooped all night , his tummy was hard and swollen , no bowel sounds , and he was screaming and crying . We finally transported him to Omaha and about 9:30 we got some poop . But ... now , he's not peeing , so , we might need to talk to the urologist ... he had a partial blockage , but , I don't know what they will do about that yet ... waiting on doctors .... 
Well ... we don't have an answer as to what was causing the problem , but , Peanut will be home TOMORROW !!! I just hope that it's not something that happens again . I don't think any of us can go through that . Mommy's pockets were so full of tears that I took from < PROPFIRST > that I thought I was going to float awaay !! You inspire me < PROPFIRST > !! I love you with all my heart !!! 
mnrttoifgyuulkjnmfgredasyhjk ; lkjnvb hgnffthfhb vgjbyhuknhkfvbfrdwferterdgjbijmb n hkygjubfgvhnkjj , n ;p ]o[98i , [-o0p -=[- k[]]\\ ..... welcome home , Peanut !!!! 
Just got a call from UNMC ... Logan's bloodwork grew out negative AND positive . They think that whatever kind of infection that was in his bladder got into his blood stream and is making him sick . So ... we are now on our way to Omaha to admit him and get him started on antibiotics . Damnit ... we were SOOO close !! 
We have a line infection again . We also found issues with his bladder and are waiting for radiology to read the results . The line infection grew out gram positive rods and unfortunately , we will be here until at least Monday ... as of now , we don't have any plans to pull the line , but , if we do , we will see how he handles not having it put back in ... 
The resident is shocked that we have not had a consult with a pediatric urologist . If his bladder was severe enough to cause a bowel obstruction , then something is wrong . I've gotten Dr. Cusick involved (<PROPFIRST>'s surgeon at Children's ) and we will find answers for Peanut . The resident said his bladder was ' impressive ' and should not have been so large . No word on line infection yet ... 
< PROPFIRST>'s night nurse , Mindee , is awesome . She just brought me an Iowa Hawkeye cupcake that she made for the Husker/Texas game !! Thanks Mindee ... it was just what I needed !!!!! 
Got the word that we get to come home today . We will continue with IV antibiotics for 4 more days , and then , do more blood work to make sure it's gone . We are waiting to get the consult with the urologist ... that will be somewhere in Iowa , so , I'm kinda hoping that we can get the consult at Children's instead !!! Start packing kiddo ... we're going HOME !!!! 
Got a call from UNMC again ... ALL of < PROPFIRST>'s blood cultures came back positive , so , the central line will have to be pulled , and stay for at least 5 days with Vancomycin treatment in Omaha . Cusick is going to pull some strings to get the urologist over to see < PROPFIRST > inpatient soon .... this is enough to make me EFFING crazy !!!!!! 
Infectious Disease has no idea how < PROPFIRST > got this infection , and they aren't really sure what's going on with it . Apparently , they rarely see this infection , and now aren't sure if they are going to pull the line . The transplant doctor on tonight isn't convinced it needs to be pulled , so , once again ... we will wait ... BUT ... I need a drink . Not the shit with a fruity umbrella .. I need something STRONGER !! 
< PROPFIRST > is currently mowing the lanolium in his room waiting for the dr's to round . Pulling the line is still up in the air , but , if it's pulled , it will be put back in . That means surgery . They think he got the infection from his probiotic . ID has seen this infection MAYBE 5 times here , and no one else has ever seen it before !! Fucking fabulous !! 
Infectious Disease came around and said that while the line hasn't been pulled yet , there's a pretty good < PROPMALE > that it will be on Friday . They don't think that the Vanco will treat through the line because the bacteria is sticky . Literally ... It creates a film over itself and repels medication ... so .. possibly surgery next week ?? 
Tonight ... I'm just going to kick back , finish watching Family Guy , and have some mint chocolate ice cream ... mmmmmm ... 
We had a good day ... sat with < PROPFEMALE > and her family for Maryn's surgery at Children's , and ran into Dr. Raynor AND Dr. Cusick . Got big hugs from Cusick , and a nice chat . Maryn did great , then Joy and < PROPFEMALE > came over to see Logan ... who is having a good day . He's peeing a lot , but , no word on cultures , but , the urologist did come by !! Whoohoo !! 
I thought we were going to have a crisis on our hands ... I COULD NOT find Gator last night . I looked all over , and thought he either threw Gator away , or left him somewhere on a walk . The nurses went into panic mode when they found out , and < PROPFIRST > was crying ... all was well when I found him stuck under his stroller ... * pfhew * .. that was a clsoe one !! 
UNMC is going to piss me off ... they are releasing < PROPFIRST > today .... we will treat through the line now . That was the plan on Sunday , and now ... 4 days later , they are saying the same thing . We would not have had to go back . < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > will stay in the Lied tonight and tomorrow to make sure they don't call us back agian .. GGGRRRRRRR 
< PROPFIRST > got home last night , and the first thing he did when I walked in the door was grab my hand and walk me around the house . Welcome home Peanut !! 
Today's a big day for us ... Logan doesn't know it yet , but we are going to start potty training tonight . I'm getting a big boy potty tonight , and we are going to try this ... any advice for little boys ??? All I've heard is horror stories so far ... 
What I want to know is ... HOW THE HELL does shit happen to us ??? I got one out of the hospital , and I had to take the other tonight . < PROPMALE > got bit by a brown recluse spider on his leg and wound up in the er . Then , as I'm signing paperwork for him , I pick < PROPFIRST > up and his diaper leaks poop all over me ... WHAT THE HELL !?!?! 
Anyone want to have a beer with me ?? Don't know how the glass in my living room table got broken , but , I got a video of < PROPFIRST > playing in the middle where the glass goes ... Can October end early for me , please !?!?! I won't tell anyone , I promise ! 
To the migraine that decided to stop by for a visit again ... go away . I don't like you , and I never have . I don't have time for you , and quite frankly ... you just irritate me . This is the 7th time you have visited me , and you just need to stop !! 
Can't wait for Grey's and Practice ... but first , I need to catch up on last weeks episodes ... lasagna .. I would like for you to meet my tummy ... it's nice and cozy in there-you will like it !!! mmm-mmmmmmm !!! 
Why is it that the people that I don't like on Project Runway ALWAYS win ?? I get so excited for the season to begin , and wind up dissapointed by the end !!! Damn you < PROPFIRST > Kohrs !!! 
Yoday did a GREAT job trick or treating tonight !! He was the only Yoda in town , and once he understood what he was supposed to do , he got all kinds of < PROPFEMALE > . He got to see all of his friends ... even Alivia !!! What a fun night .... Happy Halloween !!! 
Just got back from Omaha ... the central line has been pulled !!!! We no longer have one !! Let's just hope that < PROPFIRST > can keep himself hydrated enough to not need another one . We will know in a few weeks if it has to go back in ... WHOOHOO !!! 
What a week so far ... no central line after 2 years , and going to see one of my best friends in Kansas City tonight ... can't wait to see you < PROPFEMALE > !!! Love ya girl !!!! 
Got to see < PROPFEMALE > and the family last night !! We had such a good time !! I would drive 2 hours again to < PROPFEMALE > out with you girl !! Lets not go 10 years again this time !! 
Almost done with Christmas shopping , planning Thanksgiving , and a birthday party , and then on to a baby shower for my < PROPFEMALE > !!! Can't wait to meed Madi !!!! Already got the first decoration for the shower !!!! 
We looked for 2 days for the remote to the tv , and could not figure out where < PROPFIRST > hid it . Finally found it last night at 10 in my closet . Really , < PROPFIRST > ?? When did you plan on bringing it back out to us !?!?!?! 
Aggies beat the huskers last night !! Gig ' Em Aggies !! AND ... my cousin was on tv cheering at the Ole Miss/LSU game !!! Congrats < PROPFEMALE > !!! WhOhOo !!!!! 
Let's all head over to Mamby Pamby land ... I could use a field trip right about now !! 
< PROPFIRST > is turning 2 today !!! Happy Birthday Peanut ... we love you SOOOOO much !!! 
< PROPFIRST > had a great birthday !!! Thanks for all the birthday wishes for him .. he was pretty tuckered out after his party . I think we all were !!! My little boy is growing up ! * tear * 
I have a nakey 2 year old bouncing on my bed , putting on my sunglasses and telling me what a ' cool dude ' he is ... I see this getting very bad , very fast ... 
After getting out of the bathtub , and pottying 6 times in various spots in the house , we FINALLY went in the potty chair for the first time !! WHOOHOO !!! Now , we need to figure out how to get our brithces off , and we will get this down in no time !!! 
Ok ... note to self ... don't put anything in writing that you aren't 100% sure about . I walked into < PROPFIRST>'s room to find his pants off , and again this morning , the pants and diaper were completely off ... what the !??!?!?! 
So , is it just me , or does anyone else want to eat the heads off of the chocolate people on the Hershey's commercial ? They just look so yummy and them singing Christmas carols just does nothing for me ... 
Had a blast at the chili cook off last night .. Congrats Joe .. yours was my favorite !!! And Randy ... I'm sorry , but , I could only take one bite ... I think it will hold me over until next year !! But , congrats for holding on to your title !!!!! 
Back by popular demand ... a Christmas Vacation quote for everyday until Christmas ... Hope I make < PROPMALE > happy !!!!

We're gonna press on , and we're gonna have the hap , hap , happiest Christmas since Bing Crosby tap-danced with < PROPMALE > fucking < PROPFEMALE > . And when < PROPFEMALE > squeezes his fat white ass down that chimney tonight , he's gonna find the jolliest bunch of assholes this side of the nuthouse .
