Mmm back to work again weeee ... 

is happy to be home from work but does NOT want to go back to Dillingham tomorrow . 
is done with homework for the moment and relaxing . Apparently most of the world is an idiot when it comes to stress , who knew ? 
is back from work and workin ' again tomorrow . 
Weee ... back from camping . A hot showers are the most awesome thing in existence . 
is home from work , yay ! 
will be happy when work people figure out what they're gonna be doing soon . 
is playing D&D along with < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , and < PROPFIRST > . I am such a nerd . 
Just thinking .. at this time 6 years ago I just got to the hospital in Placerville and plopped into a bed to have a baby fall out . 
Weee .. just a few more days till the solstice . 
just spent the last 10 minutes giving a fast and loose explaination of Vodu thanks to the < PROPFEMALE > and the Frog 
' s muscles are all shakey from working out weee .... 
is bonding with the dog on the couch and doing math homework . 
I blame < PROPFIRST > for contributing to the down fall of society . 
Today's horoscope is starting to feel really really accurate .... After weeks of being nice to everyone around you , regardless of whether or not they deserved it , you're just about ready to let your true feelings be known . That means the good ones and the not-so-good ones . Ready or not ... 
is reveling in the quiet of a day off .. 
In\ 
Flanders Fields the poppies blow\ 
Between\ 
the\ 
crosses row on row , \ 
That\ 
mark\ 
our place ; and in the sky\ 
The\ 
larks , \ 
still bravely singing , fly\ 
Scarce\ 
heard\ 
amid the guns below . \ 
We\ 
are the Dead . Short days ago\ 
lived , \ 
felt < PROPFEMALE > , saw sunset glow , \ 
Loved\ 
and\ 
were loved , and now we lie\ 
Flanders\ 
fields . 
Ahh rain thank gods , now if only it didn't feel so humid ! 
is all worn out but it's been a good day thus far . Thanks for lunch < PROPFIRST > was great to catch up . 
had a lot of fun at the annual luncheon for the chief taughannock chapter of the NSDAR . Looking forward to many more to come . 
Hope everyone had a good solstice 
< PROPFEMALE > walks in and says \no homework ! \ " we say \ " oh really ? \ " then she follows up with \ " I left before I could put it in my folder so yeah its too late now ! \""
