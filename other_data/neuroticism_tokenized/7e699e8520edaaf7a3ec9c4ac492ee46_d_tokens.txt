It's a Saturday ... ugh 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > Fawcet , some of us loved you , some of us will miss you . Thank you for your contributions . * Angels and Thriller \forever \"*" 
Going to sleep ; I have work early in the morning . 
I'm so bloody nervous to look at my test scores , I'm actually procrastinating looking at them . 
is a very complicated person . Anyone disagree ? 
I can't wait for the concert on Tuesday ; I am a plague rat for life . < PROPFEMALE > Autumn , you inspire me . Ladies and gentlemen , the only artist to bounce back from an insane asylum within a year , write an autobiography , and do her first tour in < PROPFEMALE > during the year I need her most . Really ; look her up . It takes some getting used to , but ... she's so amazing . * sob sob * 
Why do so many people equate agnosticism to atheism ? Seriously , tell me . What do you think the difference is ? 
needs to be doing her Health Sciences homework ... nyyuuurrrr .... I don't wanna be a pharmacist , so why am I writing that I want to ? And convincingly so ? 
Nyyeeehhh ... I'm done with my hard tests , but I can't go home until I do my Spanish exam ... at seven o'clock tonight ... and it's bad road conditions ... DAMN IT !!! I wouldn't care if only I had to actually study for the damn test .... 
wants to know if you've ever feel so lazy that it's a chore just to get off your bed to get something to drink ? Yaayyy , apathy ... 
has a computer that hates her , every-s o-o ften ... 
... leftover three-day lasagna .... Thank you , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > , and < PROPFEMALE > for letting me dominate your kitchen for so long ! 
I have been sick with three different things going on a six-day streak . The universe hates my immune system . 
I'm arguing anti-military militarism . I'm talented , and proud . ^.^ 
Sick . Wheezing . Feverish ... well , off to run errands and go to biology ! Yaayyy ..... (( Can I trade in my lymphatic system for a later model ? Please ?? )) 
I'm so ... bored . >.< I'm running out of exciting things to try to entertain myself with . 
I wanna go away , see the world . I'm so tired of Wyoming , tired of being away from the people I love . Arin , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > , will you run away with me ? 
It isn't fair ... I finally start feeling well , so I immediately feel ill again . x.x I'm so tired of this body ; can I please upgrade ? 
I'm so bloody nervous to take this test ... it's the \I've gotta push this button to enter the test ! \ " problem ... it's the only bad thing about online classes . " 
Quite simply , I don't know what the bloody hell they're expecting of me for this damn Chemistry Lab Graph . 
I am eating black beans and rice , listening to < PROPFEMALE > Autumn , doing chemistry homework , and waiting for my medicine to make me pass out ... >.< Chiropractic appointment on Friday ! Whoo ! 
I just finished watching Pan's Labrynth .... That was ... a surprisingly good movie . ^.^ I didn't expect to like it so well . 
Gaaahh ..... I wanted to go to that damn concert tonight ... < PROPFEMALE > and Westley , you're already moving music though your body stronger than I can even imagine . ^.^ I hope the night goes amazingly for you ! 
I wish it weren't 11:34 on Sunday .... This week is going to find me . This week is going to catch me . This week is going to hit me ... with a spoon ! 
That was some ridiculous kind of chemistry lab . >.< Moronic acid-base indicators . 
* stretch * I vote school gets cancelled for the next three days ... 
Why do I always feel sick just before tests .... I have a fever again .. >.< 
... prrf . I don't wanna do anymore studying . >.< 
Wow ! A serious exam I actually feel prepared for . ^.^ < PROPFEMALE > , you've saved my GPA ... potentially ... with at SPOOOON !!! 
Hmm ..... week of evil death exams is done .... ^.^ 
I just did a bunch of research to prove that spiders self-amputate . Yay , correcting my own biology test ! (( grr )) 
Oh . My . God . Next semester is going to hurt ... I'm going to beg for 21 hours .... I need the reprieve of a fun class . >.< 
* stretch * An hour and a half , and I'll be in a defence seminar . In 24 hours or so , I'll be home . =D 
It's 1:30 in the morning . I just said good night to two of the most amazing people on this campus . ^.^ God , I hope they have the perfect dreams to round their nights out . They deserve nothing less . (( I miss you , < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE >!)) 
So ... I'm officially broken . >.< I went ice skating , and some showboating , eleven-year-old hockey player was skating circles around everyone else . His concentration slipped for a minute , and he skated at me . I lost my balance and fell . On my arm . Which was twisted behind my back . Yup . I broke my left humerus ( upper arm ) just under the ball of my shoulder joint . I'm in a sling ... yaayyy ..... 
>.< Bllleeehhhh ...... I wanna be with people I love . 
I found something that hurts worse than a broken arm : vomiting with a broken arm . Sorry , Laramie friends ; I'm staying home next week . 
This week is going to make me fail calculus , even with < PROPFIRST>'s book . Apparently , it's wrong , too . Damn WebWork ... 
I'm officially registered for classes ... It looks disgusting .... But I'm done no-later than five every day ! 
>.< Maaaaaaaaaath .... 
>.< Gonna fail !! 
I went from a 79.95% to a 73.24% ... I told you I was going to fail ... 
Guuhhh ..... A mixture of a mild cold and allergies is not the worst mixture on the planet , but it's enough to make you wanna drop-kick a something .... 
The age-old question : who's the hotter Disney heroine : < PROPFEMALE > , Megara , or Mulan ? 
By the way , don't spend money on the new Clash of the Titans if you a . ) like Greek mythology , b . ) like the old Clash of the Titans movie , or c . ) like character development .... It really was the greatest movie disappointment of my young life .... 
Let's see who is paying attention ... Every single one of you are on my Friend list as a result of a conscious decision . I am not only glad to count you as friends but also as family ! Let's see who in my Friends list actually pays ... ... attention . Copy and paste this in your status . I will be watching to see who responds . 
Damn line green line transversing my screen ... It's a connection problem , too , which makes it all the more annoying . >.< 
\What's the opposite of < PROPFIRST > Walkin ? < PROPFIRST > Reeves ! \ " \ " Aaaggghhhh !!! That was in terrible taste ! \"" 
is just not into school anymore ... 
I have some gnarly hiccups . I'm shaking the bed with them . 
I feel nostalgic . I'm listening to Dimelo , then moving to Suavemente , to Mariposa Tracionera , and Colgado en < PROPFEMALE > Bar ... * sigh * 
It's so wonderful to fall in love with writing again .... I didn't realize how much I missed these characters . 
I know it was just because that's my name on MySpace or whatever , but this ad just ... made me giggle . \Free Potato Olés® Join other Maniacs who worship Taco John's® < PROPFEMALE > orbs of deliciousness and get a free order of Potato Olés® to celebrate . \ " I had a great image of this tribe of crazy people who made a < PROPFEMALE > tater tot idol . XD " 
Grraaarrrrr ... Political Science just makes me angry . 
You know what's amusing ? Once school's out , people post on facebook a lot less often . XD 
* cough cough hack wheeze * I'm soooooooo tired of being sick ... and it's only been three days .

My skin's gettin ' clear , my hair's so bright .... \ 
Miss you guys . 
I'm just wondering : to all my friends in < PROPFEMALE > , who noticed the refinery on fire this morning ? It was this giant plume of smoke , visible a loooooooong ways away , and no one seemed to know it had even happened at work , today . 
Wenches of the world , unite ! 
wonders why listening to depressing music always makes me feel less angry at the world ... Thank you , EA . 
* sigh ... * It's so depressing to be in < PROPFEMALE > again . I never got to go grocery shopping . ='( 
I hate the chair I'm in ... it's a mixture of bed creaking and gastrointestinal stress noises ..... Eeuuurrrggghhh .... 
Nyyyeeeuuurrrggghhhh ..........

Vomitomnia .. eeewww , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Strawn ... ew .

I just got my schedule for next semester all figured out . ^.^ Eight classes , six of which are theatre classes , 17.5 credits , two online classes , mental stimulation classes , one lit class , and my first 3000 level class . I'M SO BLINKIN ' EXCITED !! 
< PROPFEMALE>'s a lying , misquoting , context-excusing jerk .

< PROPFEMALE>'s phone just made her epically jump . WIN ! 
* sigh*\ 
I should go do something productive . \ 
But I don't wanna . =D

< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Strawn , I blame you . For everything . You know what I just listened to ? Because I Got High . Yeah , that's right . Of my own volition . After listening to \It Wasn't Me\ " by Shaggy . Your stoner music moods are rubbing off . \ 
Today feels sorta ... stale . 
< PROPFEMALE > black Friday , everyone ! Don't get trampled out there , and don't get your identity stolen online ! 
I'm going to stab my Spanish book , essay , and teacher in one solid stroke . Literature is interpretive , you jerk . Not everything has to be what you say it is . 
He's exposing himself .... * stroke*\ 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Strawn , < PROPFEMALE > Likewise , McKenna Swisher you know you were thinking it , too . 
I'm supposed to be writing my essay ... but I'm now on Facebook listening to Shake It . >.< 
Hey , so ... I don't know how to tell you this , but ... Grawrr ... 
Nyyyeeehhhh !!!! Be the weekend , already ! 
I think I studied for public speaking for a total of ten minutes .... Such an easy test . 
Fooooooooooood ..... 
I wish I were an amoeba . Then , I could run around in little circles screaming , \ANGST !!! \ " all I want to . * insert explosive and totally warranted expletive here * " 
For this freedom , I have given all I have . \ 
For this darkness , I gave my light . \ 
For this wisdom , I have lost my innocence . \

Yay ! I got a 3.793 this semester ! That means I have a 3.361 cumulative , and I am that much farther away from my 3.1 of last year ! Yaaayyy !!!! Next semester : more credit hours , same skill level of classes . ^.^ 
Jay : \You're not a people-person 
Nyyyaaaaaaarrrrrrrggggghhh ...... 
Gah ! I've < PROPFIRST > so much Chicago today , I think I'm going to pop ! Arin , be proud ... I'm practicing .... 
Just got to my computer after a day with my sissy , brother , and Li'l Razzy ! ( I'm voting for Jaslyn , < PROPFEMALE > . Jazzy Razzy Justis is just too perfect to pass up ) Oh , and I have good news , Laramie family ! I now have a blender AND a waffle iron ! Bwahahaha !! And and and a hot water kettle . ^.^ My Christmas appliances are abundant and wonderful ! 
Still awake ... still mad . >.< 
Huh . < PROPMALE > Brand and < PROPFEMALE > Andrews were both in Despicable Me ... and I just now found that out ... at 3:00 a.m. the morning after Christmas . Ha .... 
It's all nice and warm and clear here in < PROPFEMALE > , but wait . What's the bet it'll blizzard on January 8th and 9th , Laramie buddies ? 
I just found a recipe for \Cranberry and Lime-Leaf Drunken Chicken\ " . Haaaaa ..... " 
Saw Black Swan tonight . I think I rather loved it a whole bunch . ^.^ As soon as it was over , I wanted to rewind it and watch it again . I loved the acting , I loved the makeup effects , and I loved the implied schizophrenia , MPD , or maybe-not-all-in-her-head . XD And I got to see it with Arin , < PROPFIRST > , and his sister . People I love ! 
I've watched soooooooooooo much Family Guy in the past 24 hours ..... 
An apple , tea , heating pad , ibuprofen , long laughing talk with Arin and < PROPFIRST > , and some kind of closure . Huh . That's a lot of feel-good things , and I do feel better . ^.^ Yay ! 
Still in < PROPFEMALE > .... 
I just re-read through my journal as a precursor to writing in it . In about 95% of the entries , I complained about being really , really hungry . Why am I so skinny ?!?! Oh , and to those of you who keep tabs on things like me , I'm safely in Laramie again . ^.^ Yay ! 
Men aren't fair ! They collect their lipids in an easy-to-evacuate bowl , then spill the bowl , and get endorphins and oxytocin for it ! JERKS ! (( and they don't get fat like women . Come on , you always wondered why our fat goes to our hips and butt while men are all skinny bitches ? Yeah ! )) 
I should be doing homework ... but why do homework when I can eat cake and milk , ponder how best to kill my teachers , and make all my Facebook friends suffer for it ? 
O.O I am soooooooo hyper . And oxygenated . =DDDDDDDDDDD 
Tired , sore , sick , procrastinating .... x.x < PROPFEMALE > , I think it might just be emo season for Facebook statuses . 
O.O After last night's busy rush to do papers and aaallll I had to do today , I don't know what to do with my spare time ... but torture my roommates . Mwa ha ha ha ha .... 
* lecherous laugh*\ 
Frankenpenis . \ 
Thank you , baby . 
Gaahh ... I just lost . 
< PROPMALE>'s playing \Ocean Avenue\ " . XD Nostalgia trip ! When was the last time you listened to Yellowcard ? " 
HA ! The voice of Thumbelina is the voice of < PROPFIRST > on the Little Mermaid . XD I did not know that ! 
Okay . it is -24 degrees Fahrenheit outside . WHY THE HELL ARE CLASSES NOT CANCELLED FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO HAVE TO WALK !? 
Another subzero day in Laramie . After wind chill , it is -49 degrees . My parents are pretty much threatening me to stay home . No one feels safe or comfortable stepping foot outside . Why won't the < PROPFIRST>'s department close the campus ? It's not snowing . -_- Really ? A blizzard at 10 degrees is more dangerous than frostbite in five minutes ? 
Here's why < PROPFEMALE>'s stupid today : I didn't get up in time to do yoga before ballet , I forgot to take my allergy pills , I forgot my dust mask , and I sat right behind the router in Stagecraft . I have a bad back and I'm allergic to sawdust . If P , then Q , if I did all these things , then I really feel like crraaapp ... 
It's freakin ' 18 degrees outside !!! SHORTS AND T-SHIRTS , GUYS !!! 
Tengo < PROPFEMALE > l < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > arco < PROPFEMALE > , y < PROPFEMALE > clavel .... \ 
Yo te quiero porque tu dolor es mi dolor .... \ 
Me gusta Juanes < PROPFEMALE > poco demasiado .... 
Dude .... Working for ChaCha is freaking addictive . 
It's a negative number outside .. 
Gah ... Anyone love Pink as much as I do ( despite her name ? ) ? 
Mental disorders are prerequisites to being an actor ... Melancholy has long been revered as the < PROPFIRST > of the great presence on the stage . 
is tired of all the negative and really low < PROPFIRST > in the forecast ... two degrees isn't a high ; it's disgusting . 
< PROPFEMALE > breakfast tea , sugar , < PROPFEMALE > , heavy cream , tramadol , flexeril , and a bath make me a little better ... x.x 
< PROPFEMALE > Tee Dubs , today was pretty fantastic . ^.^ 
EA concert , best ever ! \ 
Though I did get generously sprinkled with spit , \tea\ " and kerosene ... problem there ... \ 
There is no high that is worth this low , and what's the bet that there's a low out there that can make this feel high ? 
Huh ... < PROPFIRST > gets increasingly abusive to < PROPMALE > as the series progresses to the point where he openly admits < PROPMALE > is the < PROPMALE > thing wrong in his life . Take this lesson , though , children : < PROPMALE > takes it all in stride and takes pride in the fact that he is annoys everyone ^.^ You strong , fat cat , you . 
Yeah !! The Fall 2011 schedule is posted for UW finally ! * woot * Now I get to be a nerd and plan all next semester ... 
o.o Watching a documentary on Wolverines . It jumped at the camera and scared my so hard I hit my head on the wall behind me .... ow ... stupid learning . 
Well , I did my first mock trial tonight . Did fan-freakin'-tastic if I do say so myself . And it only took , like , an hour .... Left and came back before anyone was even home again .... * mumble grumble merf merf * 
Huh . Well , according to one list , I have two of the top-ten strangest allergies ever . >.< And I have to go combat one today . Damn you , wood shop ! (( but I love building ! Y.Y )) 
Nyurff .... Hot tea with < PROPFEMALE > and lemon , chicken noodle soup , a heated blanket , and a feel-good movie , yet I still feel bleurgh-ish . < PROPFIRST > gave me his cold and then left . x.x Jerk . 
Just finished watching Miracle on 34th Street .... Fitting , considering Laramie is supposed to be getting 5-8 inches of snow in the next 36 hours . >.< 
should probably stop watching South Park ... 
mrr .... I need to go to sleep ... 
HAHAHA11 I'm reading \31 Ways to Fall Asleep Fast\ " . One of the tips is \ " Think about your hobbies . \ " \ 
The sky is blue and all the leaves are green . \ 
The sun's as warm as a baked potatah ! 
I'm done with all my prerequisites , but I can't take one of the classes I'll need to take for my degree . What should I do next semester : take just the classes I need , end up with 14 credit hours , and be bored out of my mind ( but have extra Hathaway money ) , or pay for some 1000 level class I REALLY don't need just so I'm not bored ? mrr ... 
Okay , I've decided ! I'm taking 14 credit hours and eleven of them are theatre credits !! XD XD XD XD !!!!!!!! Theatre Literature , Intermediate Acting , Stage Makeup , Stage Movement I , Tap Dance ( thank you so much , < PROPFEMALE > Knight ! ) , and my Hip Hop Honors Online class !! I'm so excited ! jgaiongi ; owaei ; oar !!!!!! 
nyurr ... I need to buy some Vicks and DayQuill ... x.x So tired of being sick for the past two weeks . 
Do I want to walk all the way back downstairs just to wash my cereal bowl ? It's so far away ... 
Journaling idea : \If I'm not as close to God as I used to be 
Brown paper , white paper\ 
Stick ' em together with the tape\ 
The tape of love . \ 
Ooh , the sticky stuff ... 
What in the world should I write an argumentative essay over in Spanish ? 
Jeez ... two hours sure goes by bloody fast ... off to focus lights . 
Well .... Damn . 
Nnyynnngh ... I can't breathe through my nose , I'm coughing and lethargic and achy , and it's in the single digits outside ( negative after wind chill ) . What a wonderful day to live in Wyoming . I miss you , < PROPFEMALE > Justis and your city's eighty-degree weather !
