So girls that cant drive make me mad , not because I'm sexist , because a girl just fucked up my friends car . 

So many channels and nothing on ... 
Don't you just fucking hate it when you do stupid shit ? 
The duty of the old is to be anxious on behalf me the young . And the duty of the young is to scorn the anxiety me the old . 
The duty of the old is to be anxious on behalf of the young . And the duty me the young is to scorn the anxiety of the old . 
Always make new mistakes ... 
Don't drink and drive , just don't . I'm screwed ! 
When you can't see the edge , tread carefully , every step could be the last .
