Might go see Sherloc Holmes with < PROPFIRST > and the Davids , and stay the night at Keeners house , depends what my dad says . 
It all fell through . I was supposed to go see Sherlock Holmes with < PROPFIRST > and The Davids but it didn't work out . Dad is taking us all to < PROPFEMALE>'s for the weekend 
Looks like we might have school . I giver up checking the BOE site , they change their minds to much . For those of you that don't know , I got a mild case of frost bite ... on my feet . I got feeling back and the swelling has gone down but my feet are still pretty bad . :( 
Tired . Goodnight . The way things look right now , we are gonnna have school . I'm gonna hate tomarrow . It's the 1 year anniversery of my parents divorce . 
Watching the big bang theory . Hoping my mom says yes to going to davids this weekend . Idk wat I'm gonna do tomarrow , it might just happen to be one of thoes boring days were I sit around and play random riff from Dethklok songs , lol . good nite every body . 
Well , not allowed to go to Davids tomarrow . On the bright side I'm going to Valley to < PROPFEMALE > with < PROPFEMALE > . Oh , and anyone that thinks they have deciphered 33 by Coheed and Cambria is about please tell . For those of you who don't know , every song by Coheed and Cambria tells a part of the story of The Amory Wars , and < PROPMALE > doesn't tell anyone what part of the story the songs are . 
Going to valley then over to < PROPFIRST>'s . I was supposed to go to < PROPFIRST>'s but his dad wasn't gonna be home so my over protective mom said no . It's not like anythinh horrible would happen , I mean seriously . 
I had a great weekend !!! I got to go to Valley and < PROPFEMALE > with < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , and Aly . I stayed the night at < PROPFIRST>'s and I don't know if he relized but I was actually figuring out his bass part to a song I'm writing . If this weekend was awwesome then I can't wait to see what this week will be like . You know , life really is what you make of it . I made it great . 
* sigh * this move is gonna suck . I'm attached to that house , its where all my memories are at . It's ineviteble and its nobodies fault its just gonna suck . don't worry mom and dad , I'll be fine . 
Gotta go to go back to the school . I have some inormational meeting thing . I got recommended to attent a college in Vermont .

Just downloaded alot of Coheed and Cambria ringtones ... oh ... I LOST THE GAME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
' s plans got messed up . Why is there always a storm , a parent saying no , or a zombie apoclypse when ever plans get made . 
Today was one of those days where you just feel bleh , and when you try to have fun or make things alittle more interesting , the plan always fails . I hope we don't get pounded with that snow storm , then I won't be able to go to the movie or go skateboarding . I WANT SPRING !!!!!!

I wanna send a high five out to all of my friends that have been called freaks , geeks , nerds , weirdos , gay , dorks , or bizzare and are proud that their different from those jocks , preps , and uptight people . Kudos to you and Carpe Diem ! 
Life is like a game of poker . To win you have to be smart , cunning , quick witted , devious , and willing to make wagers . Yet some how , just by < PROPMALE > , you can loose it all . 
WOOOO !!!! Going to Florida tomarrow with the band !!! You can make fun of us and call us band geeks but guess whose going to Florida !!! HAHA YOU STUCK UP PREPS AND JOCKS !!!! SUCK IT !!!! XDDDDD

Pure hearts stumble\ 
In my hands they crumble\ 
And fragile and stripped to the core\ 
I can't hurt you anymore\ 
Loved by numbers\ 
You're losing life's wonder\ 
Touch like strangers detached\ 
I can't feel you anymore\ 
There's sunshine trapped in our hearts\ 
It could rise again\ 
But I'm lost , crushed , cold and confused with no guiding light left inside 
Do you know that life is ending , \ 
As we go , the dots connecting , \ 
We had our < PROPMALE > to save the garden , \ 
As it dies , our souls will harden , \ 
With these words chastising your conscience\ 
Were breaking through and praying for\ 
transcendence . 
:/ so many sheeple 
This storm came out of no where @_@ 
@_@ i was late to band . Shld have left earlier 
@_@ why do victorian < PROPFEMALE > clothes have to be so expensive 
Goin to my grandmas for a week . probably won't have service , definately no internet . If I do get internet , I'll be stealing it of a hotel XD 
well im back from webster . Had an ok time . i got to drive down and back so theres a total of 5 hours that go to recording my time 
You could be my unintended \ 
Choice to live my life extended \ 
You could be the one I'll always love \ 
You could be the one who listens to my deepest inquisitions \ 
You could be the one I'll always love 
Will my < PROPFEMALE > ever heal from the waterfall climbing accident 
I think I have my song for the band camp talent show . only question is wat guitar to bring and will it work with the < PROPFEMALE > system 
choppin off the mop Xd 
Nothing like being that kinda tired where you all calm and stuff , listening to a Tool album you haven't listened too before , and talking to friends . 
You know they guys from tool had to be on some extra crazy weed or something when they decided it would be a good idea to name a song \hooker with a penis\ " XD " 
ya knw , when I look and see that some ones relationship status is complicated I think : atleast its complicated compaired to totally non exsistent . 
Uhg , phone is broken . it sucks big time . Im just lucky that there is internet at camp 
back from band camp . Its been a long week and I feel like crap XD 
every little thing she does is magic 
Uhg , life is so chaotic lately . I wish I could drop everything and just take a breather . If only I could live in bliss , and then I woud be fine . 
Tool is like novacaine for the mind . Yet it opens my mind more . 
don't know how it happened but I ended up listening to old AQUA songs XD 
I need to find asylum . 
Probably not the best idea doing Ylmxntrth research and listening to Tool at the same time . This Ylmxntrth stuff if looking like either an overly elaborate creepy pasta or and overly elaborate ARG . 
Uhg . looks like I have less than 2 weeks to finish my summer homework . better start the next book now . 
Age is an illusion . It is an illusion because time is and illusion . Age and time are inventions of man and exsistence doesn't use them . Age is the measurement of how much time something has exsisted . Time how ever is an illusion and that means age has no rule to measure by and thus it doesn't exsist . If people would just pull their heads out of their butts they would be able to see past the illusion of time and age . 
I feel like I accomplished some thing tonite . I got a shout out from Men who have beards and the women who love them . XD 
so I just realized I have 9 days to finish reading A Separate Peace and then do 2 assignments on it . I also have one more assignment for Their Eyes Were Watching God . and an autobiography . god I hate honors english . 
I have the \fish fry\ " starting here soon and then off to stef's party at 4 :D " 
Had the greastest time at < PROPFEMALE > Webb going away party . I'm gonna miss you tons stef :D have a great time at Princeton and do come back to visit . 
I want to see < PROPFIRST > pilgim sooooo bad but idk who to go with or < PROPFEMALE > 
I would wish it all away if I thought I'd lose you , just one day 
its hard to get your work out there 
When you reall love something , then it loves you back , in what ever way it has to love . 
schedule . \ 
1 health-janes\ 
2 biology-scherich\ 
3 band- dunn\ 
4 English honors- roberts\ 
5 Geometry- butcher ice\ 
6 history 1900- ricer\ 
7 Earth science- burns 
I downloaded the entire Megadeth discography so I'm in a freakin awesome mood :D 
Well I have a ton of work ahead of me today . I have to do a topic statement with supporting details , constructive reponse problems , a quilt (?) , and a autobiography all for English for monday . Looks like I'm starting the year with some tension with my english teacher considering I asked her what my autobio should consist of and she got snobby and told me to figure it out myself . 
I'm very different than the rest of my generation . I feel that I have a broader view point than the rest . I get and see things they don't nor ever will . They won't see unless they change this destructive path they are on . I come with a message . A message of hope for those who listen , and a warning to those who do not . There will be a mass calling and those who have liberated minds will be the ones to make it through . 
Some time I wonder how correct Descartes was when he said \I think therefore I am . \ " For what do you do when you continue to think and no longer are ? " 
well I have 8 hrs before the first day of school starts and I don't have my summer homework done 
So its official , I'm a sophmore . But oddly I don't feel older . I still feel like a freshman and I call last years seniors seniors still and its the same crap as last year XD 
So I officially have my stuff for english done . no more naggin and getting beat down by roberts 
So I found a jazzbass and an alvarez acoustic for 125 a piece 
This is a super epic nite ! < PROPFIRST > , ET , and < PROPFIRST > are stayin the night . totaly epic . ET brought his bass . 
had the best day evar hangin with chessie and ET 
Just down loaded Fire Fox and is lovin it ! 
So I'm in like the greatest mood evar . had an extremely awesome day . 
Why do girls after after the @$$holes ? now dont get it wrong with why do girls go after the bamf kinda guy . I'm talking about cocky , high and mighty , genuinely mean , SOBs 
dood ! I just changed my facebook layout with FaceTweak on FireFox ! 
In my confused state of < PROPFEMALE > reached out . I tried to find solid ground of some kindto shed my doubt . I was weary of my day to day fightwhere I was too tired to shout . And in my search I found my light ; the only thing I was sure about .? 
So I feel almost awkward to say hi now . 
gag me with a spoon ... nah , make it a spork . sporks are always better . 
bleh computer crashed . and tomorrow are pics 
well the game went well . show went well . all is swell . I guess 
all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration . we are \ 
all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively . There is no such\ 
thing as death , life is only a dream , and we are the imagination of \ 
ourselves . 
gonna go run around town . < PROPFEMALE > with some friends 
so according to adults , they are the only ones who know how to love . Its rather self righteous and selfish for them to think they are the only ones who can love . They forget when they discovered what it was . now I probably sound like the stereotypical angsty teen so I'm just going to stfu now . 
So we managed to fit 3 people on a folded up futon to sleep XD we're tards . idk what I'm gonna do today . 
Wrapped around his finger , you can't see that he has manipulated the situation so that you are mad at me . 
So the band needs a new guitarist . < PROPFIRST > went to drums and < PROPMALE > doesnt want to switch back to guitar so we need a guitarist . hit me up if you want the spot . msg me on FB or txt me . 
I hate being so impatient . please bring the < PROPFEMALE > to release the the suspense ? 
In these hard times , when people have lost all hope for humanity and just get comfortable and watch us destroy ourselves , people turn to god . Any god . Something they can grab on to , to anchor them and give them something that won't vanish with man . But , finding god will not help for he can't even find us for we have been forsaken from his eyes . 
so it didn't go as planned . there was the theatrics I imagined , the outcome wasn't the one I hoped for . Neutrality remained . 
so yeah , I got band practice in the morn and then over to < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > s for more music . I wrote the lyrics to 5 songs and I only have the guitar part to one so we are gonna go work on it and the others . 
Soaked [ check ] tired as crap [ check ] shoes full of astro turf [ check ] best show we will probably have all season [ check] !!!! 
DDT did a job on me XD 
So the band just got back from the motown band spectacular . It didnt go too well . wasnt awful but wast the best show we have done . The stuff before and after was pretty fun though . 
So apparently my dad had bought nickle back tickets soooooooooooooo guess who is the lucky person that gets to see them with him :D ME ! 3days grace and < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > are opening for nickle back :D 
DOOOOOOOOD ! Just saw Nickleback , 3days grace , and < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > . That was totaly amazing ! 
So ... I've been friends with a totally brutal guitarist but never really checked out his bands . well I can now officially say that I'm in love with Goatmill and Razorbliss . check them out on Myspace . totally epic bands . 
found out that couch springs have other uses than to make a couch bouncy . XD

is so excited for the manhunt for < PROPMALE > on friday 
so there was a coup de main in scrabble club today . in short , i was over thrown as the VP . curse thee < PROPFIRST > . 
So do you ever get that feeling that you are getting shoved out of social circles and even ur best friend ditches you for new people ? 
placed third in parade 
lost my virginity to the TOB judges cause we got screwed 
is having an amazing time at fujiyama 
kinda glad I didn't go to home coming , I'm enjoying this me-time 
I think I was born in the wrong country . I can't stand the decadence of < PROPFEMALE > in every sense of the word . 
Borders are the gallows\ 
\ 
Of our collective national egos\ 
Subjective , lines in sand\ 
In the water , separating everything\ 
Fear is the cause of separation\ 
Backed with illicit conversations\ 
Procured by constant condemnations\ 
National blood-painted persuasions\ 
Here's my song for the free\ 
No , it's not about praise and publicity\ 
Corprotocracy , what a hypocrisy\ 
Aristocrasy versus democracy 
well I'm like wtf'ing left and right over our score . Idc that we came in 4th . What ticks me off is we dropped 2 points !

So I'm really hating all the rain . I'm running out of days before it snows and I need to get in as much blading and skating as possible . It all work out though , because one way or another I'm gonna get a new snowboard to replace the one that got stolen . 
Well , gonna have < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , and < PROPFIRST > over tomorrow . hopefully .
