||Upside||down|| . Boy , you . t.u.r.n. { me } , _I . n . s . i . d . e_o . u . t_ . & [[ Round & Round ]] !!! 
Beauty < PROPFEMALE > of only eighteen , She had some trouble with herself . He was always there to help her , She always belonged to someone else ~ 
Just got Home From WANGO TANGO . Floor seats ! OH BABY ! <3 
And this life sentence that I’m serving ? I \ 
admit that I’m every bit deserving , But the beauty of grace is that it \ 
makes life not fair . :] 
Maybe I need some rehab , or maybe just need some sleep ? I've got a sick obsession , I'm seeing it in my dreams ; I'm looking down every alley , I'm making those desperate calls ! Im staying up all night hoping , Hit my head against the walls ! 
I am finding out that maybe I was wrong , That I've fallen down and I can't do this alone . . . Stay with me , this is what I need , Please ? Sing me a song and I'll sing it back to you ! I could sing my own , but what would it be without you ??? 
No muscle bound man could take my hand from my God , ( my God) ! \ 
No \ 
handsome face could ever take the place of my God , ( my God , my God) ! \ 
He\ 
may not be a movie < PROPFEMALE > , but when it comes to bein ' happy , we are . \ 
There's\ 
not a man today who could take me away from my God ! \ 
* SISTER ACT X ]* 
Love me , Love me , \ 
Say that you love me . \

What could it be in you I see ? \ 
What could it be ? \ 
Oh love , oh love , \ 
Stop making a fool of me ! 
I've gone to far to come back from here ; \ 
But you don't have a clue . \ 
You don't know what you do to me ! \ 
I've come to far to get over you , \ 
and you don't have a clue , \ 
You don't know what you do to me ... \ 
Can't someone stop this song , \ 
so I won't sing along ? \ 
Someone stop this song , \ 
so I won't sing ? \ 
Your lovesick < PROPFEMALE > is gonna get the best of me tonight ! 
Well I had my ways , they were all in vain ;\ 
And He waited patiently . \ 
It was all the same , all my pride and shame , \ 
And He put me on my feet . \ 
They call him love , love , love , love , love . \ 
He is love , and He is all I need . :3 
Baby why don't we just turn that tv off ? \ 
Three hundred fifteen channels of nothing but bad news on . \ 
Well it might be me , but the way I see it the whole world has gone crazy ! \ 
So baby why don't we just dance ? ;)

It's frustrating when you THINK you WANT one thing , and when you finally \ 
achieve it , you realize that even though you got what you wanted and in \ 
the end it probably is the best choice , You'd rather be stuck\ 
with the thing that's going to HURT more l a t e r as long as you HAVE \ 
that p r o b l e m staring in your face and keeping you s m i l i n g NOW . 
some t h i n g s we don't TALK about , rather DO w i t h o u t , and just h o l d the SMILE 
I feel sick . >> \ 
I think I shall go knock out for the next 14 or so hours . * thumbs up * 
Angel of Music ... you deceived me . 
Praying for < PROPFEMALE > days to return to me . Seeking the warmth of the solar rays . \ 
I’m not just seeing the gray skies in front of me , Praying for < PROPFEMALE > days ... 
It's the good girls who keep the diaries , the bad girls never have the time . Me ? I just want to live a life I'm gonna remember , even if I don't write it down . 
It was not your fault but mine , and it was your heart on the line , \ 
I really f***ed it up this time , Didn't I my dear ? \ 
Didn't I my dear ? 
I would have stayed up with you all night , If I'd known how to save a life . 
When I open my eyes , I realized ;\ 
it was only just a dream . 
It could all be so simple , But you'd rather make it hard . \ 
Loving you is like a battle ; And we both end up with Scars . :/ 
SO , I went to Jingle Ball yesterday ; Talked to Taio < PROPFIRST > , Held hands ( briefly ) with < PROPFEMALE > , got complemented and took pictures with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > , and sat Front row . :O \ 
Overall , even with missing the few people I did , It was a pretty awesome concert xD . 
It was always my intention to Brag , and Steal it all away from you now . :3 
i am such a nerd . RED TEAM FTW . :3 
So of course , with me being one of the last of her family members to actually talk to and spend time with her , she would complain , set out to destroy what little happiness I own and/or alienate me . \ 
God , I love my family . 
So , On my way to the DMV , the car broke down . Nice . xD 
Can't wait till ' Being Human ' starts tomorrow , at least i won't have to look it up on the Internet now . :3 && Ughhh , MTV ? Why remake ' Skins' ? The original is so much better >.> 
Homemade Spaghetti anyone ? : # 
Yeahh , I think my guitar hates me . > < lol 
Well I'm not paralyzed but I seem to be struck by you , \ 
I wanna make you move because you're standin ' still , \

So , I failed my permit by 1 question . T___T I should have just gone with my gut on those 2 questions ! 
Okay , so imma try to play this thing again ! Wish me luck , lol

I WOULD UNDERSTANNNNNDD , \ 
I WOULD UNDERSTAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNND 
I got my Permit ! :D now I just need to practice driving . XD 
Man , I was thinking about unrequited love . I figure it's best to just walk that shit off . Find someone else to be excited about . It's like if you love ice cream but your Ice cream man friend won't give you any . Maybe he's got a good reason . It cuts into profits . Who knows ? But he likes you As a friend and wants to < PROPFEMALE > out anyway .

Hi Hollister ! :] \

Giving up at something that no longer serves a purpose , or protects you , or helps you , isn't giving up at all , it's growing up . 
Have you ever just taken something the wrong way ? You Know it's not meant in a cruel way , or said to be mean , but you still just can't help feeling ... Slightly hurt ? :/ Ahh fml . Lol 
A person likes to think of himself in a certain way , and when something happens that makes that no longer possible , you mourn the old self . The person you thought you were . 
http://mobile.formspring.me/#profile/view/FangDoesBite . Ask awayyy 
There comes a point when you just love someone . Not because they're good , or bad , or anything really . You just love them . It doesn't mean you'll be together forever . It doesn't mean you won't hurt each other . It just mean you love them . Sometimes in spite of who they are , and sometimes because of who they are . And you know that they love you , sometimes because of who you are , and sometimes in spite of it .
