Watching Texas Vs . OU with < PROPFIRST > ... calm before the storm ?

Where do you buy more soil to plant with in farmville ? I can't find it ! 
What do you do when you put your SD card in the computer but nothing comes up ? Any suggestions people ? 
Wow uploading pictures is so time consuming ! I'm so behind schedule ! Not one thing packed for home and it past two ! Yikes , I have a 4-5 hour drive ahead of me still . 
Ok finally leaving at ten till five . Nice 
Just got home from seeing New < PROPFEMALE > ! It was amazing ! 
How did everyone get their stables built so fast ? Any suggestions ? 
Alright famville buddies , I only need two nails and five boards to complete my stable . Could you please help me out ? Thanks ! 
Farmville friends ! I need four boards please ! 
MmmMMM just pulled some ribs out of the oven after six hours . They are tender and delicious . Better hurry home < PROPFIRST > ! 
I've had no cell phone for five days . It only got annoying about ten minutes ago .. 
Will be moving to < PROPFIRST > in about a month and a half . What a drastic change of events . I never EVER thought I would be sad to be leaving < PROPMALE > . 
Thinks potting training is one of the hardest things yet ! Cleaning up poo and pee off the floor really is easier than the diaper . Unfortunately that is not the goal we are aiming for ! Good thing we have hard wood floors ! 
Loves < PROPFIRST > the Sheep 
A rare opportunity for me to catch a nap , both babies napping at the same time . :)

Watching my prirated New < PROPFEMALE > dvd , the kind that was actually recorded in the movie theatre with a camrecorder . Surprisingly good quality ... ohhhh yeaaahhh ! 
Packing and what a pain it is ! There is always twice as much cleaning out as there is actual packing . Goodwill here we come !

Moving tomorrow morning .. Heading back down to < PROPMALE > . 
Ochocinco : The ulitmate catch . Oh wow , just about as ridiculous as the booty pop commercial I saw the other day . 
omg < PROPFIRST > is making me watch True Blood- fairies and all ... oh nice they cry blood tears . hahahah 
Happy Birthday to my most precious baby girl Carys < PROPFIRST > . 
Perhaps they are\ 
not the stars , but rather openings in Heaven where the love of our lost\ 
ones pours through and shines down upon us to let us know they are\ 
happy . \ 
-- For my beloved Grandma < PROPFEMALE > and Mother in law < PROPFEMALE > Burnette . I love you both and think of you often . 
Officially ordered < PROPMALE > and Carys ' Halloween costumes .. ( : 
Just finished another great episode of Boardwalk Empire .. let's see what other gems my DVR has in store for me . 
Before work .. Pride and Prejudice or New < PROPFEMALE > ? Quite the dilemma ..! 
Arrr , some fool forgot th ' rum . We be chasin ' around fer some more , as fast as one wooden leg can do . 
I get home from work and < PROPFIRST > has a present for me .. It's a dvd obviously .. BUT does anyone know what it could possibly be ? It's Eclipse and The Runaways on one DVD ... BOOYAH ! The wizard works his magic once again ... ! 
< PROPFIRST>'s fake wolf tattoo just stained the couch in red marker ... 
Thank you so much everybody for showing me some Love today ! ( : 
Let's go RANGERS ! 
Just heard that your keyboard and desktop have 400 times more bacteria than a toilet seat -- time to disinfect ! 
You’re pretentious . This club sucks . I’ve got beef . Let’s do it ! - < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim 
Forgot how much I really like music . 
Watching Eclipse for approximately the 10903934893 time . Oh yes , it's been that many . 
Thinks a pair of < PROPFIRST > slippers would be nice .. 
Tried to turn on the heater and three fire alarms went off in the house . 
Really exicted ! Just got a < PROPMALE > Christmas tree for 30 dollars .. I've got the Christmas music going . Now it's time to get that puppy in its stand .. (: 
Thinks a lot of people out there need to take a class on how to be considerate human beings ... the little things go a long way ! 
I need some new books to read ... any suggestions ? 
Jackpot ! Just found a single Dvd that so far contains : Finding Nemo , Monsters inc , Toy story , Toy story 2 , A Bugs life , Beauty and the Beast , and 4 other unnamed movies as of yet .... we've stopped to watch Beauty and the Beast ! 
Happy 3rd Birthday , to my precious big boy ! 
So < PROPFIRST > just offered to drive me over to Baton Rouge ... Where Breaking < PROPFEMALE > is currently filming .. 
Damn you FB , why must you force me to upgrade my profile ..? 
< PROPMALE > Cake ! It's delicious , and calling my name .. 
Time to go learn some Spanish ! 
All the chances we took\ 
We're so close to something better left unknown\ 
I can feel it in my bones .. 
It's starting to feel a little springy down here in < PROPMALE > ! Nothing like some warm weather and birds singing to cheer me up ! 
Getting ready to head to < PROPFIRST > to see my favorite girls ! Woooo hooooo ! 
Wishes the groceries would unpack them self ... 
Homemade Green Curry , yum 
Thinks everyone should watch \Inside Job . \ " You'll be really glad you did . " 
This Jerky tastes like dog food smells
