don't judge me ... i know i'm not perfect and i don't claim to be , but before you start pointing fingers at others make sure your own hands are clean . 
Nobody is worth your tears , and the ONE who is won't make you cry . 
Everything happens for a reason . people change so you can learn how to let go . things go wrong , so that you appreciate them when they are going right . you believe lies , so you eventually learn to have trust in YOURSELF and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together . 
Thanking god for a good and hopefully a speedy recovery

WHY PEOPLE BLAME EVERYTHING ON THE DEVIL . ( DEVIL GET OFF MY BACK , HE/ SHE FULL OF THE DEVIL , THAT'S NOTHIN BUT THE DEVIL , OH MY FAVORITE ... THE DEVIL MADE ME DO IT ) TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR UR OWN ACTIONS IT'S NOT THE DEVIL IT'S U . PEOPLE GIVE THE DEVIL MORE CREDIT THAN THEY DO GOD !! 
Life is full of CHANGES >>> ENJOY IT 
IF ANYBODY IN MY FAMILY HAS SOMETHING TO SAY TO OR ABOUT ME B A MAN/WOMAN AND COME TO ME !!!! 
I'M HAPPY IF U DON'T LIKE IT THAT'S UR PROBLEM ...... FIND UR OWN HAPPINESS 
Happy about my new fresh start n my life ...... goodbye to the haters , if u not on my side wishing me the best then that's ur problem u either jealous or unhappy with yourself ... cause I'M HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY and lovin it . 
In life sometimes you just have to step out on faith and let god do the rest . you can't let friends , family or people dictate your life they r not livin it u r , do what makes u happy , if they don't like it that means they r not happy with themselves to b happy for u ... So my new life has started ... i'm happy , loved and ready for what the future holds .........

Thanking god for a new beginning in my life , everything feels right , the house , new state and a new chapter n my life ..... thank you god 
Don't judge a book by the cover , open it up and read it .... god places people in ur life for a reason if u judge just by the outside u might miss out on the blessing good has in store for you 
Thanking god for a wonderful day !! 
Enjoying a quiet day ..... at peace and happy . 
True love is when you wake up next to him and he's looking at you .... SMILING !!! Goodnight fb .... 
Something to think about :\ 
\ 
NOBODY is worth your tears and the ONE who is won't make you CRY ......... 
“A woman/man has got to love a bad woman/man once or twice in their life to be thankful for a good one . ” 
life is about trusting ur feelings , taking chances , losing & finding love and happiness , appreciating memories and most of all learning from the past . 
Enjoying my family here n Jville , FL . Thanking everyone for all the prayers for my baby boy , he's doing much better , hopefully he will get to come home tomorrow .
