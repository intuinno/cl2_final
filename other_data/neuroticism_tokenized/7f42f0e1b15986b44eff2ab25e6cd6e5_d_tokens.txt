when we are strategic then we can be spontaneous 
Let's see how honest FB friends are . Leave a word , comment that you think best describes me ... It can be only one word . No more . Then copy and paste this to your wall so that I may leave ... one word about you . This should be interesting . Keep it going ... 
The only time you should look down on someone is when your bending down to help them up 
this day keeps getting better and better 
Glad i could help :) 
loved how this day ended 
so school today wasn't so bad until one thought entered my mind it's thursday this week seems like it's going on forever when will it end 
I'm not going down that easy , it takes more than that just to break me , i'm not going down with out bleeding , i'm not going down , down without a fight i won't go down without a fight , it's just you and me tonight , face to face and do or die , i'm laying it all out on the line 
All of this is changing , None of this seems real , I just keep on waiting , To see if I can feel , Something like an angel watching over me , Maybe that's exactly what's in front of me , ' Cause I'm better off now , Since you came around , You've gone and shown me , Everything I needed just to see that I am , Better off now , Since you came around , All I had to do is see what I could be , So I could know I'm , Better off now 
likes to talk about dinosaur theories with tori .. while others listen in :D ( cough cough < PROPFEMALE > ) 
funny how little things can make your day seem so much better 
When your only friends are hotel rooms Hands are distant lullabies If I could turn around I would tonight These roads never seemed so long Since your paper heart stopped beating leaving me suddenly alone Will daybreak ever come ? Who's gonna call on Sunday morning ? Who's gonna drive you home ? I just want one more < PROPMALE > To put my arms in fragile hands 
Was this over before Before it ever began Your kiss Your calls Your crutch Like the devils got your hand Your lips Your lies Your lust Like the devils in your hands Everyone in this town is seeing somebody else Everybody's tired of someone our eyes wander for help Prayers that need no answer now Cause I'm tired of who I am You were my greatest mistake I fell in love with your sin Your littlest sin 
Would like to thank everybody for the birthday wishes you guys are the greatest :) 
Loved every minute tonight some times were better than others but all in all good night 
Don't shut me out , I'm an arson to myself , Who can't put out the fires , Until there's nothing left , So take my broken glass , And help me make a window , So i can see your face , After all that I have been through 
I know your out there , And I know you care , ' Cause I feel you , Like an angel watching over me 
I am on my knees , ' Cause You're everything I need , And I've made a mess of myself , On my own , Now I am on my face , And I'm calling out Your name , And I won't run away , ' Cause I'm already home 
just got back from the xtreme winter conference where i spent the weekend with my youth group and it was awesome !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 1

Be yourself everyone else is already taken

I hope to see this in all status of my family and friends
