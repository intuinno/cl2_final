While you SCREAM at your woman , there's a man wishing he could talk softly to her . While you HUMILIATE , OFFEND & INSULT her , there's a man flirting with her and reminding her how wonderful she is . While you HURT your woman , there's a man wishing he could make love to her . While you make your women CRY there's a man stealing smiles from her . Post this on your wall if you're against Domestic Violence .

Please put this on your status if you know someone or are related to someone who suffers from stupidity . People need to understand that stupidity is real and should be taken seriously . You could be sitting next to a sufferer right now . There is still no known cure for stupidity , and sympathy does not help , but we can raise awareness . 93% won't copy and paste this , because they don't know how to copy and paste . 
Would love to just crawl under the covers and go to sleep . Tired ! 
< PROPMALE > is Not going to the Gulf anymore . He will be home for the holidays !!! He's depressed but I am happy !!!! 
Really hoping this week goes by fast ! 
Every\ 
person has 1000 wishes , a cancer patient only one : to get better . I \

because of cancer or are still fighting it 
So < PROPMALE>'s White Blood Count went down a little but they want to check it again in two weeks . Thank you everyone for your concern . 
I am so freakin PROUD of my HUSBAND today !!! I love you < PROPMALE > !!! Great Job . 
Having faith is like being a pumpkin . God picks you from the patch and washes all the dirt off you . He cuts off the top and scoops out all the yucky stuff . He removes the seeds of doubt , hate & greed . He carves you a new smiling face and puts His light inside of you to shine for all the world to see . This was passed on to me by another pumpkin . Now it's yourturn to pass it on . 
Had a lot of fun last night . Up at 6 and still tired but the kiddies need me . A huge thanks the < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFEMALE > for Karaoke and Drinks !!!

Why's of Men\ 
\ 
1 . WHY DO MEN BECOME SMARTER DURING SEX <3 This one .... so true ! =P \ 
\ 
( because they are plugged into a genius ) \ 
2 . WHY DON'T WOMEN BLINK DURING SEX ? \ 
( they don't have enough time)\ 
3 . WHY WERE MEN GIVEN LARGER BRAINS THAN DOGS ? \ 
( so they won't hump women's legs at cocktails parties ) 
My husband can be such a pain in the ass , but for some reason I am still head over heals in love with him . I need help ! =) 
Another freakin headache and lots to do today . =( 
I feel very blessed to have such amazing friends ! We had a blast yesturday !!! 
Dear Mr President , I hear you would like to freeze pay rates for our military starting next year . Would you also consider cutting your own pay to save much more money for our country ? While you're at it , lets cut down congressman's pay too . If the people who risk their lives don't get an increase in pay , why would we continue raising pay for those who take no risks and reap the benefits ? Post this if you agree 
Happy Birthday to my sweet little boy < PROPMALE > !!! This year has flown by and I am so proud to be your mommy . I love you very much ! XOXOX The BIG #1 !!!

So take too many pictures , laugh too much , and love like you've never been hurt because every sixty seconds you spend upset is a minute of happiness you'll never get back . \ " , 2010-12-23 15:13:07 "

Here we go again ...... we are supposed to get 8-14\ of snow starting tonight ! It's not looking like school will be in session tomorrow . " 
I loved you the minute I heard your heartbeat . I loved you the minute you were born ; then I saw your face and fell in love some more . You were only a minute old , but I knew I would die for you and to this day I still would . When you choose to have a child , you make a conscious decision to allow your heart to walk around outside of your body . Put this on your status if you have children you love more than life . 
Bournedale Schools Are ALL closed tomorrow ! I'm hoping < PROPMALE > doesn't have to go in either but I don't think we'll be that lucky . 
BEER !

MY PRAYER IS THAT IN 2011 A CURE WILL BE FOUND . WILL YOU POST IT ? JUST ONE HOUR . DO IT FOR ALL OF US IN MEMORY OF TOO MANY TO MENTION AND IN HONOR OF ALL FIGHTING 
Really excited to go shoot some bows and arrows next weekend at the range ! 
Just got my wedding ring cut off my finger with bolt cutters ! Thanks < PROPMALE > . :) 
Can't wait for Criminal Minds tonight !!! 
Criminal Minds 1/2 hour away . Time to get the kiddies to bed ! 
Really should get some sleep . Don't know if that will happen tonight . :( 
I really feel naked without my wedding ring on . :( 
Yet Another Snow Day . At this rate it seems like the kids will have to go to school until July . 
So < PROPMALE > is on his way to the ER with < PROPMALE > . :( 103 fever and climbing . We have tried everything to get it down but it's still going up . I really wish I was with them right now but < PROPFIRST > is out like a light and we didn't want to drag him out of bed to make him sit in an ER . I really wish I brought him not < PROPMALE > . :( He's almost at 104 and bright red in the face . 
Ok , so they are keeping him under observation for a few hours because < PROPMALE>' heart rate is elevated to 190 and normal for a high is 120 . His fever is still high . They are giving him fluids , antibiotics , Motrin , and Tylenol . I wish I was with him right now ....... Can't sleep , very concerned ! Please pray that he gets better soon . 
OK < PROPMALE > update : He is doing better . They got home at 5am . When he left the hospital he still had a high fever , it has gone down to around 101/102 his heart rate was still about 168 but unfortunatley there is no good way for us to check it at home . Good News : he is playing and eating this morning ... oh and yelling at his toys :) Thank you All for your kind words and prayers ! I'll post more updates later . 
So I woke up and told < PROPMALE > I wanted to go to church this morning and he said that I couldn't until I finished my paper for class ! WHAT ???? Ok dad thanks ! Can't stand being controlled ! 
PROMISE TO MY CHILDREN : I will stalk you , flip out on you , lecture you , drive you crazy , be your worst nightmare and hunt you down like a bloodhound when needed ... because I LOVE YOU ! When you understand that , I will know you are a responsible adult . You will NEVER find someone who loves you , prays for you , cares about you , and worries about you more than me . Re-post if you love your children . 
While you scream at your woman , there's a man wishing he could whisper in her ear . While you humiliate , offend , and insult her , there's a man flirting with her and reminding her how beautiful she is . While you hurt her , there's a man wishing he could take her pain away . While you make her cry , there's a man stealing smiles from her . Post on your wall if you are against Domestic Violence & Mental Abuse . 
IT'S FRIDAY !!!!! :D

The weather today matches my mood ..... depressing ! 
So not only did I have my world turn upside down on me this week but I got a phone call tonight saying that I can no longer go see my therapist and get meds for my OCD because they stopped taking my insurance . UUUGGGGHHHHH !!!! 
Hate being lied to ... specially by those who supposedly love you . I just can't catch a break lately . Depressing ! 
Government Shutdown ? Will it happen ? 
With all my stress right now it's nearly impossible to get any of my class work done ! 
So happy it's Friday ...... annoyed with this whole Gov shutdown issue ...... tired , achy , frustrated ...... but most of all so blessed to have the most wonderful little boys in the world ! \ 
In love with my children ! 
Thanks to < PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > for a wonderful dinner . We love you both ! 
So we were at dinner with friends and I asked < PROPFIRST > what we live in and he said , \ 
< PROPFIRST > \The solar system . \ " \ 
It's Sunday and beautiful out thank God . What to do ??? 
Looking through some old pictures this morning before i put < PROPFIRST > on the bus . 
I was supposed to have a meeting today and guess what ? It was canceled for a second time . Starting to become very frustreated this morning ! 
Good Morning All ! Hoping my stress doesn't go through the roof and my OCD stays at bay ! 
MMMM Breakfast for dinner tonight was great ! 
Very sadly , most people probably won't copy and paste this . Will you do it and leave it on your status for at least an hour ??? April is Autism awareness month and Its Special Education week , and this is in HONOR of all the children who need a little extra help , < PROPFEMALE > & understanding ! 
So I just heard on the news that EASTER EGGS are now known as SPRING SPHERES . You know because we have to be politically correct . SERIOUSLY !?!?!? 
Warm GrapeNuts cereal with a sliced banana on top = A happy Mommy ! 
Finals this week ! Here we go again ! 
It seems like I am always fighting to stay awake during the day ! Hate not sleeping at night . 
“To be in your children’s memories tomorrow , you have to be in their lives today”

OK no more procrastinating ! Time to get to my final ..... wish me luck !

Starting two new classes today .... My brain is being overloaded . Wish I had a break between them ! :/ 
< PROPMALE > is walking great lately !!! He is definitely on the move ...... and so is mommy . Thank God for his big brother . :) 
Does anyone know any really good informational sites about ADHD ? 
Cannot wait to see my dearest friend when she gets home from her trip ! Her babies miss her too .... all four of them ! :) Love you < PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > ! Safe travels !!! 
What a simple yet priceless act of watching my boys devour powdered donuts for breakfast . It was a treat for them and me ! :) 
The house has been scrubbed , dishes are done , laundry is in the dryer , kids are taken care of , now to figure out what I am cooking for dinner and dessert . Oh and I still have school work and grocery shopping to do ...... It's only 10:45 and I already want this day to be over :( \ 
Tired ! 
I personally believe in Jesus Christ . One facebooker has challenged all believers to put this on their wall . The Bible says , if you deny Me in front of your peers , I will deny you in front of my Father . This is a simple test . If you love God and you are not afraid to show it , re-post this . I proudly did !!! Thank you Lord for blessings received . I am not ashamed !!! 
5 DEADLY TERMS USED BY A WOMAN . ( 1 ) FINE - this is the word women use to end an argument when they know they are RIGHT & YOU need to SHUT UP . ( 2 ) NOTHING - means SOMETHING & u need to be WORRIED . ( 3 ) GO AHEAD- this is a dare , not permission , DO NOT DO IT . ( 4 ) WHATEVER - is a woman's way of saying F**K YOU . ( 5 ) THAT'S OK - she is thinking long & hard on HOW & WHEN you will pay for your mistake . Re-post if u agree 
So tired today ! Would love to get back in bed for a few hours ! 
Procrastination ! :( 
Not really feeling up to doing anything today ! :( Think I might stay home . 
I've carried children within my body . Slept with babies on my chest . I've kissed boo boos and mended broken hearts . I've been puked on , peed on , and spent sleepless nights in the rocking chair . But I wouldn't have it any other way . My body isn't magazine perfect , but when I look in the mirror I see a MOM , and there is no greater honor !! Post this as your status if you are proud to be a Mom !!! 
Wishing a very Happy Easter to all of our Family and Friends ! <3 <3 <3 
Baby has a fever . :( Just hope it breaks soon ! 
Very tired . Lucs is sick ...... fever , cough , can't sleep . Poor baby . < PROPFIRST > is just now getting over a little cough he had probably where < PROPMALE > got it from . Love that they share but they didn't need to share this . :( 
With all the drama that we have had in this family and all the bad news I still feel so blessed for everything I have . Feeling appreciative this morning . It's time to start looking in a new direction ! 
Whether you are a fan of the show \Glee\ " or not you should watch last nights episode ! Great job ! " 
We all have insecurities but only some of us will admit it . 
We fear things in proportion to our ignorance of them . \ 
- < PROPMALE > Livius 
OK I can't do the walk anymore . I'm sorry for those who wanted to go . The walk is still on if you need information about it but I can't go because of something very important that I can't miss . 
I hate how stress gives you headaches . I wish it would go away I have a paper to write and chores to complete and a child that desided to cut a large hole in his shirt in school ! 
Last week < PROPFIRST > was diagnosed with ADHD which many of you know , then today at the Doctors they told me they think < PROPMALE > may be AUTISTIC . Are they for real ? Very concerned right now and could use a friend ! 
Had a great time with my dear friends . I love you < PROPFIRST > ! Thanks for everything tonight I'll miss this . By the way the walk home was interesting .... remind me about base security driving by . LOL :P 
< PROPFIRST > lost his first tooth last night !!! 
It is stunning outside today . Really not wanting to stay indoors at all ! What to do ? What to do ? 
Very sleepy tonight but like always probably wont sleep throughout the night .... waking up 2-3 times every evening . UGH ! Makes for some very long days ! 
Very tired today ! Would love to go crawl back in bed . 
Starting to really hit me how many friends are being re-stationed soon . Too soon . I have a feeling this will be a very lonely summer . =( 
In honor of Mother's Day I'm trying to see how many of you are willing to change your profile picture to a picture of your mother and keep it there till May 9 . Please repost this as your status so everyone gets the word and see how many beautiful mothers we can get on FB ! I did , I miss you mom ! 
Just got very upset when I caught one of the guys that cuts the lawns on base looking into my window ! \ 
I'm Pissed ! 
So happy to see the sun shining today !
