My Wish for You in 2010 ..... May peace break into your home and may thieves come to steal your debts . May the pockets of your jeans become a magnet for $100 bills . May love stick to your face like Vaseline and may laughter assault your lips . May happiness slap you across the face and may your tears be that of joy . May the problems you had , forget your home address ! 

We have school tommorow . It sucks , wasn't enough time . OH WELL . 
I am very bored . Getting annoyed at this stupid computer . Doesn't do a thing right .
