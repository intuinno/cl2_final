A couple who has been married for over 30 years had been trying to have a child for years . A month ago she was diagnosed with cancer , apparently the size of the tumor she had was so big that the doctors said the prob . of her surviving was slim to none . Last week she left the OBGYN last week with a big smile on her face : instead of cancer she was actually a few months pregnant . :) ANYTHING is possible people .

About 2 years ago I started praying for everything that I wanted in a guy ... met many that were great but they def . weren't it ... about a year later God decided to roll up everything I had asked when I had least expected it and sent me U .. honestly .. your WAY more than what I would have wanted or expected :) Happy 1 year to my < PROPFIRST > NoFinesse < PROPMALE > 
God put that dream in your heart , and He already has a completion date , He already sees it done . We may not see how it can happen , it may be taking a long time , all the odds are against you , but if you'll just keep believing , keep praying , keep doing your best , then God promises He's going to bring you from start to finish .

“Sometimes we stare so long at a door that is closing that we see too late the one that is open . ”- < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > - 5 days down and 360 days to go ! Lets try n take advantage of all the open doors this year . If a door closes find peace in knowing that there was a reason for it . 
\Morning by morning- your mercy awakens my soul ... You've taken my breath away with your irresistible love\ " - Hillsong . been waking up singing this song for the last few days . :) Love it . "

There's a raging sea .. Right in front of me .. Wants to pull me in .. Bring me to my knees ... So let the waters rise ... If YOU want them to ... I will follow You - I will follow you . 
Do not be anxious about anything , But in everything by prayer and Supplication with thanksgiving Let ur requests be known to God . There is nothing impossible with him around . 
There are no such thing as coincidences ... How can there be- with God around ? EVERYTHING in life ... whether good , bad , sad , happy ... etc ... is a part of a large plan . You and I are not not able to see what will happen a minute from now ... we can only see what has passed . I say you live ... just live ... and whatever God brings your way - you accept it .. thank him for it and then .. just Live 
*** Goooo Steelersssssssssss !!!! ***

People come into your life for a reason , a season or a lifetime and when you know which one it is , you will know what to do for that person .
