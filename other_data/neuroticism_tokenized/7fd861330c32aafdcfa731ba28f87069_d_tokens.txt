The transition is always a hard one ... 

Idk

Yo god love's me ... I < PROPMALE > have to much to drink ... he's love is great ... and he saved me from sin ...!!!!!!!!! 
I wonder , to life and love alike my journey is now on autopilot . I've taken off but this ship has no landing gear . 
With righteousness in my heart and faith in my eyes , I hope to reach new highs and become apart of something new ... skylarking all the time !!!

One thing about game is everybody has it , its just that ... nobody's ever won it ... that's why I stay 100 ... ya spend ya whole life tryna win over someone else ... ya gonna lose , everything feels somuch cleaner when u live outside of bull shit ... it just get a little hard when u r there by yourself !!!....
