50 first dates :) i LOVE < PROPFIRST > sandler ! and i really like < PROPFIRST > barrymore .

For some reason , this week seems to be flying by . Not that im complaining . One more class for the week :D 
Damn . 
Just got hit on , on the trolley . Awkward . 
One week down , seven to go :D 
I just realized ive been meat free for two days :D 
Two hours to kill with nothing to do :/ 
Sitting next to a hardcore < PROPFEMALE > fan , as i wear my chivas jacket . I love the irony haha 
I hate that never ending cough . especially in a 300+ lecture :/ 
Two weeks down , six to go :) 
Is it weird that the new grocery section at target made me super excited ?? Haha 
Yea , yesterday was the first day i think . I remember cuz its my sisters birthday lol 
Correction : previous status was meant as comment on my own status , in response to < PROPFEMALE>'s . I feel dumb haha 
A group of high schoolers just missed their stop as the rest of their group got off . Hahaha 
Just finished my dev psych test . Now i can enjoy the rest of the week , especially tonight :) 
One more week down , five to go :D 
hahahaha \If I were an enzyme I would be DNA helicase so I could unzip your genes\ " smart . reminds me of manroes " 
my parents want to take me out to eat , and i have no idea where to go . any suggestions ? 
never have i been so grateful for another year . it's been crazy and i realize that no day is guaranteed . thank you everyone :] those five seconds you took mean a lot . going to sleep very full , courtesy of my parents and fuddruckers . :D which reminds me , i'll be needing to put in some overtime at the gym tomorrow ... :p good night you guys , and again , thanks :) p.s. i <3 onion rings :3 
why must casttv cut me off right before the good part ? :/ 
Theres an older lady on the bus who looks like the red < PROPFEMALE > :) 
I would say four weeks down , four to go , but a short notice trip to mexicali ends the countdown . Unfortunately , a short notice tri is never a good one :/ 
< PROPFEMALE > ( age almost 9 ): if we ever get a house , i told mom I want my own room . I've never had my own room . me : well neither have I . Lizzette : i could share with you ! ...... oh , wait ... HAHAHAHAHA she's so funny . :D 
< PROPMALE > & < PROPFIRST>'s brownie sundae flipped out <3 
although i told myself i'd be making a second trip to the gym today , i can't seem to make myself go . maybe next week . haha 
when im on myspace and see a status , i go to like it , and realize i cant :( hahahaha\ 
im too used to facebook to function on myspace anymore 
Preparing and excited for moms surprise party tomorrow :) currently making a cake with a mixer from the sixties :O 
The smell of the cake reminds me of my easybake oven days haha 
mother's surprise hawaiian party = success :D \ 
( p.s. she cried ) 
Just realized todays my last day of classes :D 
i CANNOT miss two gym sessions in a row !! i have to find a way ... 
Not feeling the gym today :/ on the brighter side , im now watching lilo and stitch :) 
helping < PROPFEMALE > with her essay . how I miss the days of simple , five essay paragraphs ... 
enjoying every last bite of the VERY counter-productive mrs. fields white chunk macadamia cookie . 
dad shut up the kids because he couldn't hear the movie . did I mention it's Balto ? \ 
haha only in my family ... 
Just saw a guy drive a truck backwards . Reminded me of a bronx tale :) 
And so concludes my first year post high school . And the first celebrationactivity in order is a nap . A really long one 
holy crap ! A on a math test = proof of miracles ' existence :D 
i feel really really bad for < PROPFIRST > right now :( and not just cuz i hate Toluca . :/ 
proud of catching that psychology reference on law and order . :p \ 
mrs. silver and prof . < PROPFEMALE > would be proud . haha 
listening to loveline . I like < PROPFIRST > a whole lot more than psycho < PROPFIRST > , which is just ironic . 
SUPER excited to find out what my grades were !! It amazes me that I didn't end up with any C's :D 
maybe my favorite thing about the end of a semester is being able to clean out everything and just get rid of it . papers , saved documents , recordings , everything . :) 
I hate many things . among the , lack of communication >:/ 
mexicali is just around the corner ... :D 
\ ' cause there's beauty in the breakdown \"" 
To pursue , or not to pursue ? That is the question :/ 
I've come to a conclusion . I'm going to stop caring , stop trying . Not with my life , but with others . screw the world . :) 
I guess that airplane song is going to be the new overplayed song on the radio . so many statuses with a reference to it . either that , or a lot of people could coincidentally really use a wish right now .. 
airborne is disgusting :/ but if it works ... 
< PROPFEMALE > vu .. 
going to watch superstar with gisselle . She loves that movie . Did I mention she's four ? 
my little sister < PROPFEMALE > got some stuff from her third grade teacher ( who was my third grade teacher ) and in it she found a list of names . Students from my class , ELEVEN years ago ! :) looks like I have some people searching to do ... :p 
On my way to visit palomar to watch my little brother and sister in the finals for the olympics :D good memories .. Kinda of . Haha 
olympics were fun . < PROPFEMALE > got a first place medal for her relay team , and my brother did too , along with a second place ribbon for the obstacle course . :D good to know some of us came out athletic :p 
just found out why my room smelled like < PROPFEMALE>'s secret when I got home from the gym . -.- now I have to clean the mess . :/ 
how many cookies does it take for your family to notice you're breaking your healthy eating ? \ 
\ 
answer : i'll get back to you once they notice .. 
Woke to a baking binge of < PROPFEMALE > . Cupcakes , cookies and brownies . For no reason . ?? 
\respect is just a minimum ... how you gon ' win when you ain't right within ? \ " \ 
the only day of the summer we won't be taking care of kids and she wants to spend it cleaning ??! < PROPFEMALE > needs to get her priorities straight ! 
old scary movies ( circa late 1950s ) are more funny than scary . \ 
ex : when you can tell the \ghost\ " is on wheels :D " 
Going to my little brother's championship baseball game :D very excited , but WAY more nervous , for him . 
Rediscovered charm ! :D i know what i'll be watching for the next month .. 
I don't like oysters anymore . 
watching spiceworld :) I'm taken back to second grade . oh , the memories .. 
listening to the new CP crap rules and stuff makes me SOOOOOOO glad I'm out ! Block schedule is the least of the problems :/ 
Just woke up from the third UB dream this week . :) :'( 
Another UB dream ? I hope so . :) nite , night owls . 
Nature center with the kids :) 
home alone , exploring my new phone , thanks to my dad's hedonistic ways :D 
my dad gave my food to the dog >:| 
At kimbal park . fireworks were pretty cool . :D a little crowded , but its a good thing the carnival is still there tomorrow . :) 
One ride on the octopus : 3 tickets . Look on cousin's face while we're on : priceless :D 
Somehow i knew july 10 would be a bad day :/

so good at procrastinating , i spring clean in the summer :p 
my 8 year old cousin is finally back from the hospital :D 
Movie at the park with the kids :) 
i can already tell getting classes will be frustrating . -.- 
watching popeye and < PROPFEMALE > boop makes me miss imaginitively silly cartoons :( 
pizza with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > = good day . + TWO new shoes = great day :D 
so i had every intention of picking a new profile picture .. and then i decided to tag one of them . and then i tagged another , and another ... \ 
so now pretty much all of them are tagged , but i still dont know which pictuere to change to lol 
It was about freakin time that they make a spoof . Definitely going to watch vampires suck when it comes out !!! 
My brother's teaching my grandma how to play < PROPFEMALE > ultimate alliance so we can have four players LOL 
burned tongue = NOT cool :( 
just got my classes , and I'm \crash \"- free :D " 
if anyone in my family has to write a note or letter , chances are I actually wrote it :p haha \ 
also , side note : if you have a graphing calculator for sale , let me know :) 
I think I'm going to sleep now . great talking to you elementary school guys :D and < PROPFIRST > for making my day :p hahaha good night ! ttyt 
so I WAS going to mention the drama nightmare I had , where I had to go onstage and I didn't know ANY of the lines , but I just found out that my dad impulsively disconnected all the cell phones . >:/ ( someone needs to come up with a really good \angry\ " emoticon ) " 
Reese's Puffs are ADDICTIVE ! I finish and then I get more hahaha 
< PROPFEMALE > , while watching hocus pocus , \man 
Go daddy-o ! 
i think i'm being used by my grandpas 50 something y.o. friend to make his ex wife , who we just ran into ar a restaurant , jealous . what could possibly make it any more awkward ? oh , yes ... my grandparents are going along with it . are they high ?! well , i would only be surprised if my grandma was ... :/ 
it's that time of the year again ... \ 
football ( chargers , specifically ) , how I've missed you . \ 
:D 
I think I'm going to forgo gym tonight & just take a nap until tomorrow morning . 3 hours of bad sleep is not enough to run on for 12 hours , not counting gym :/ 
Mexicali , after four l-o-n-g months :D 
Happy 16th birthday , < PROPMALE > . Thank you for making me realize that nothing is guaranteed . Not a long life , not a minimum age , not even a single day . 
To quote a certain rapper-turned-actor , \it was a good day . \ " :) " 
gym is hard to get used to after not going consistently for a while ... but here I go again ! 
I just realized it's been ( over ) four years since december underground came out ! :O \ 
Times FLIES ... \ 
But it still gives me good memories :) 
:D HOPE YOU GUYS HAVE A \ 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY , to < PROPFEMALE > Valles-mckee , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Gutierrez , Kristela Mendoza , < PROPFEMALE > Aldana , and Gibran Zavalza 
Only in my family ... ( #2 )\ 
... would my dad try to trick/pressure me into drinking beer o.O \ 
lol 
so today in physiological psychology , we learned about the brain ... If there's one thing Mrs. Silver taught me , it's that my hippo is on campus ! :P 
my grandma just offered to clean my room . she has NO idea what she's getting into :P 
taking it one obstacle at a time ... \ 
1 . read ( 60 pages ) for physiological psych\ 
2 . review for astronomy test\ 
3 . review for phys . psych quiz\ 
4 . read ( 25 pgs ) and do astronomy HW\ 
has to be done in T - minus 12 hours ( with some time for sleeping , preferably ) \

SOOOOO tired .. :( \ 
I want to go to sleep ... but I don't pay gym membership to make excuses , so .. here I go\ 
( I can always sleep after ) 
and now ti begins ... I LOVE this month :D 
Glad to hear comic-con is ours for another five years :D \ 
I havent actually gone , but I would like to , so it helps to have it here :) 
7-28 , chargers ! :D \ 
( and gates caught his 500th ! ) 
I just uploaded my first youtube video ... :S \ 
It feels so weird . 
what a corrupt family . :/ 
This yes-no-yes-no is making me mad ü > : ö 
This talk of light in my astronomy hw reminds me of leary and T.O.K. :) everything but that color ! 
I love that my mom gets when I make an eagleton reference ! :D 
so it's official . He knows , and now it's only a matter of time until we're back on Palomar St. :) 
Electric slide = mrs. Mckay , and 5th grade , pretty much . :) 
Sometimes , great days stem from bad mornings :) it's like the overcoming of that is enough to more than make up for it . 
I just woke up from a dream that combined elementary school people with UB , with a little bit of middle school . it was SO weird . but nice :) 
I hate BARELY missing the bus !! This one way thing on palm is VERY annoying :/ 
Wow . I did not know how much I missed Trongale until tonight :) and everyone else !! Good luck Mayte !!! :D 
reunion #2 here i come :) 
palomar friends and cold stone . SUCH a good day :D 
recognizing rembrandt's self portrait on a package of cheese at vons gives me hope that I passed my < PROPMALE > history mid-term :S 
made it home just in time for friends :D 
I LOVE getting shoes on sale ! :D 
And it keeps getting better ... :D 
so paranormal activity 2 ... pretty cool . the scariness was ok , but i really like the storyline . connects very well to the first . kinda . :) \ 
thanks for the money , < PROPFIRST > :P \ 
and < PROPFEMALE > , for keeping it funny . :D ( though you almost didnt get in ms. im under 17\ :P \ 
I'm gonna have a waterbed again :D and in other news ... Going to the national city swap meet and having burritos de papa ! It's been a while .. 
I want to move . I just don't want to do the moving . that makes sense , right ? haha 
so I just * love * how i took all my blankets to the other house ... forgetting that I still need one while I'm still here ... let's see what I can mooch of everyone else .. haha 
enjoying what could be my last day home alone . 
the guy across the street is playing \te quiero\ " by hombres g with his friends :D " 
Neervous as I wait for my dad at court ... Not for him , but because I'm beginning to worry I might be late to class .. On a test day -_- 
Just realized it's my half-birthday today :D 
my mom left me an abnormally long list of things to do before I leave for school . the problem ? I was asleep ... so I can't remember !! 
So my phone just rang in class ... And the embarrassing part isn't the fact that it rang , but that the ringtone is a generic one that comes with the phone :S 
glad to soon be going to the other house to bring back some important items I didn't think to leave for now . Like blankets , clothes . and shoes ! having 20+ pairs you would think I would have shoes to wear somewhere here -_- \ 
I had to wear < PROPFEMALE>'s shoes ( she's 9 ) . which made me realize ... I can borrow her shoes ! & since my cousin gives her shoes that don't fit anymore , I've just tripled my shoe inventory ! :D 
because only one coiuld go to the gym with my mom today , I stayed home . and because I'm not going to the gym , I'm going to eat cake :) 
nap was NOT enjoyable :/ 
SO glad I went to homecoming :D \ 
thanks to will , < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > for making my night . You guys are hilarious . \ 
first time ihop trip too ! 
I can't find my stupid phone and it's making me mad !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Found my phone :D moving stuff on haloween sucks , on so many levels haha 
Good bye internet , close bus ride to gym and trolley , 99 cent store , coldstone , bank , and 711 neighbors . Officially at palomar st. now :) 
So much for never being home alone . And I mean that in the best way possible , of course ! :D 
I'm sorry November , but if today is any indication , you just won't be as good as October(which was GREAT ) . Accept it . :) 
Voted :D 
i find it really interesting that eveyone is posting about their dreams :) coincidence ? \ 
boyfriends seemed to be the theme in the three of mine ?? and tecate . weird . 
Going for < PROPFEMALE > . I COULD walk and get some exercise since I didn't go to the gym this morning ... Ooooor I can take the bus >:) 
it's probably not healthy that I watched the 2nd season of how I met your mother today , but I did :) 
40 < PROPFEMALE > car trip and i forgot my mp3 player :/ but my dad's in a mana/hombres g/los prisioneros kick . I lucked out :D 
ust walked 5k cfor breast cancer :D saw < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > s . :) what would be a cool name for a team next year ? already taken : saving second base , save our coconuts ( hawaiian themed team ) , hakunama TATAs , and gaga for tatas ( with a lagy gaga dressed leader ) . :D 
It's turning out to be such a good day :) 
It's sooooo trippy watching 21 jump street . < PROPFIRST > depp looks so young and the 80s wear that was normal back then .. it looks like costume to me ! the one long earring thing , the glasses !!! all I have to say is I'm glad the 80s are over . :) 
WHAT A COINCIDENCE ! i just finished watching an episode of 21 jumpstreet , turn on the tv and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > starts talking about how theyre going to do a remake of it . weird . \ 
oh , and i dont like that :/ 
I NEED new clothes :/ 
I now remember why I don't watch boxing :( 
another good night :) 
punk < PROPFIRST > depp <3 
Bad day for the trolley :/ 
I think it's time for another all nighter ... 
I LOVE that all my classes so far have tied in together . It makes things a lot easier to learn :D 
What do you know ... I'm still awake , and I'm not even sleepy . Go figure . I am , however , tired of astronomy :/ 
My mom remembered I have a test and bought me choc covered raisins :D AND she brought home cookie crisp AND reeses puffs cereal . It's going to be a great day :) 
I FINALLY get to sleep !! :D 
glad I'm not into < PROPMALE > Potter . Otherwise , I'd be hating Facebook this morning :) \ 
but then again , I would have probably been there if I was ... 
Busted . 
< PROPFEMALE > just played against a team whose coach is < PROPFIRST > macmillan :O 
can't find my glasses ~ >:/ 
Ready to enjoy the 2nd night of a whole waterbed to myself in a row . :D last one for a while :/ 
I'm at walmart and this little boy is sooo cute . I was looking for a glow in the dark poster and he started helping me :D 
got some MUCH NEEDED shopping done . :D 
my professor just referenced night at the roxbury on the archived lecture as an intro to \what is love ? \ " :D makes me wish I had watched this live :( " 
I . AM . SCREWED . 
SO . I came home to early thanksgiving , after what started as a bad day . but I guess that's not too weird because today feels like a thursday anyway . also , bomb threat at the school transit center , but I got a ride home . thank you < PROPFEMALE > Avila :) but the best part of all is that the scores for today's test are up already , and I really surprised myself . now I can enjoy the coming week . :D 
tahini at the 99 cent store . :O my life is complete . :P 
< PROPFEMALE > peanut pasta <3 
Loteria + basta = holiday classics <3 
I was hungry , so I made food . I finished , and now I'm feeling nauseous and it's worse when I look at the food :/ 
BEAUTIFUL . i almost feel bad .. HAHAHAHAHA ! nah ! 
who loves orange soda ?? :D 
I must say , I'm pretty proud of myself for improving my procrastination . I still have until thursday to read 6 chapters , BUT I'm staying tonight to do that instead of tomorrow . Baby steps :) haha 
Just saw a silver pt cruiser with pink flames pass . The driver ? An older lady , with interior and a hat to match :D 
TWOWEEKSTWOWEEKSTWOWEEKSTWOWEEKSTWOWEEKSTWOWEEKSTWOWEEKSTWOWEEKSTWOWEEKSTWOWEEKSTWOWEEKSTWOWEEKSTWOWEEKSTWOWEEKSTWOWEEKSTWOWEEKSTWOWEEKSTWOWEEKSTWOWEEKSTWOWEEKSTWOWEEKSTWOWEEKSTWOWEEKSTWOWEEKS . \ 
:D 
The public transportation gods must be pleased with me . :) 
Maybe it's time for a car ... 
Adventure successful ( for the most part) ! I feel really good :D 
i've always wished there was a < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > theme park . 
Man , I guess it's my turn . Wish it could have waited a week , though :/ 
Nothing like a cheese roll and christmas circle to distract me from my throat :) 
a few things I learned today :\ 
It is possible to analyze a painting , and write about it , for three pages , in a few hours . \ 
I use WAY too many commas in my writing . \ 
SDSU is very creepy at 5 am , especially when you forget your glasses :/\ 
the trolley ISN'T emptier on the other side . \ 
lessons learned . :) 
My mom made me lunch :D complete with chocolate covered raisins and tamarindo juice :) 
Fact : glaring sun makes you squint\ 
Fact : squinting after an allnighter makes you want to close them REALLY bad\ 
Fact : I'm about to fall asleep on the trolley 
Man , do i have good luck ... :D 
O wow !! I got a B in astronomy ?!?! I'll take it ! 
Making a christmas tree ... Nope , not decorating .. MAKING . haha 
these last 5 days have been really great . spent time with family , went to see the black swan , and got a hair cut . :D really great indeed . 
just burned my wrist . -_- stupidity is painful . :/ 
After a thought that turned into an idea , I have decided that I'm rethinking texting . It's so impersonal to text when you could do it another way . So from now on , it won't be my first resort :) 
\welcome to your new profile . now with more ways to show and tell your story . \ " \ 
wait , so I'm not a taurus anymore ?! lame :/ \ 
yea , I know no one believes in it and all , but theres still some form of attachment there for some reason haha 
in an attempt to regulate my sleeping pattern for next week , I just pulled an all nighter and let me tell you , it is WAY easier when there isn't something you have to do haha but in order for this to work , I'll have to last all day :S 
so i finally saw elf tonight :) and note to self : chocolate peanut butter shake from < PROPFIRST>'s is REALLY good ! reminds me of reese's ... and you know how i feel about reese's ... :D 
came across some 4 yr old notes and letters . :] ah , sophomore year . you were bittersweet . 
FINALLY . Sleep . i was beginning to worry i was becoming nocturnal :S 
\He may not have a clue 
being sick sucks :/ 
I have discovered the prettiest gummy bears ever :O so colorful ! :D 
I forget how fun concerts are :D 
I found out I don't have my last class this week , and NOW my other professor is letting us knw we don't have one class next week . :D good day , indeed . 
In spite of all the formatting stuff we need for papers , It's good to know we'll always have double spacing :P 
I feel I missed the A train on this one :/ 
Extended stay :D 
I have a test and paper due today , but i still feel really good :) 
It's that time of the semester ... All-nighter , it's been a while . Can't say It's been too long . 
Kettle corn , your crunchy , salty sweetness eases the strain of today . Thank you . 
Random days are the best :D you never know what little actions will do ! 
such a good weekend :D \ 
New stuff , deep stuff , light stuff , fun stuff , nostalgic AND productive . ( that last part is rare :P )
