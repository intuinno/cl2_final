All I can say is that if this continues this scenerio will end with \Sister beats the shit out of Brother\ " ' NUF SAID --------------> Gotta Love Siblings ? "

It's like the missing comes in cycles . You're on my mind then you're not then once again . Hmm well Fargo and shopping should occupy my mind ! If only for a while 
Imagine you could have anything in the world . What would it be ? Now imagine if that \it\ " was actually a \ " who ' ... " 
Well nap time for me . 
Sittin here thinking of you . Wiping the occasional tear from my eye . Actually a < PROPFEMALE > depressing . 
What's the point anymore ? I try so hard to get something I want but never get it no matter how much it hurts .. Then I continue on like nothing is wrong . Life ... 
Lol so apparently when i'm pissed at others i CAN'T be a bitch to , i use my bitchiness elsewhere . Haha oh fun .

I swear it gets worse and worse every day .. =/ 
Glad she got on us about what we are doing wrong today we needed it . Thank you ! =) 
I'm so tired . Was at work till midnight but i haven't been able to sleep since 5 am . =( 
My cat eats cheese puffs .. 
Some people ... \ 
Good lord !.. 
Snow ? What the hell is with this shit ..? 
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes !!! \ 
FIRSTTTTTTT !!! \ 
I cried hahahaha 
Goin to Fargo with < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > ! Yayyy 
Tryin to convince < PROPMALE > to buy me a seahorse . =) 
3 more months of hell . The question is though , will things go back to normal ? Like they were last summer or better ? It's nice to hope so cuz right now I really need it .. 
Fuck it . I give up on it all . Finally just to damn much . I can't take it anymore . Pondering even going to work tomorrow , is it really worth it ?.. 
At < PROPFEMALE>'s cuz the buttface fought with me for it ! Lol love you ;) 
Huh dangerous place . Slammed my finger in a door , sent a tingle through it and cut it . < PROPFEMALE > slipped on water and almost smacked her skull on the wall . 
What is this strange pain ?? 
Bahahahaha attempted Black Ops for my first time today . =D 
Throwin \confetti\ " for < PROPFEMALE>'s birthday at Pizza Hut ! Hehe " 
Ya try and try , for what to come from it ? 
Bahahahaha oohhh poor < PROPMALE > =) got the shit scared out of her thanks to me and < PROPMALE > ! Haha sorry love you ! 
It seems like the bruises and cuts never end . How can one person do so much accidental damage to herself ? =) Gees . 
2 1/2 months . It won't solve everything but it'll help some . Summer summer . 
Got off of work early to go see my niece with < PROPMALE > . Love you < PROPFEMALE > and Tab . 
Feel so useless .. 
Went to work . \ 
Now soooo much homework ! \ 
College chem- check\ 
Econ- check\ 
College dev . Psych- work in progress \ 
But then I'm gonna shower so time to get this stuff done-bar ! 
Owww my throat 
Hahahaha threw a piece of cheese at < PROPMALE > from across the table . Hit her in the eye ! And got stuck behind her glasses ! 
Oh what's day 
Oh whata day 
I don't wanna sleep . I don't wanna think . 
Forever and ever you will be in my heart Tab . 
Everytime I think I have cried myself dry , the tears come back full force . 
Oh Tab . I made the mistake of thinking about you while at work . Everyone keeps telling me I will see you again one day but i'm selfish and want you back now . =( 
< PROPFEMALE > jacked my noodles right off my fork ! Damn . 
Why does the weekend have to go so quick 
Can't I be done crying !? \ 
I don't wanna do this it's to hard . 
I hate homework . \ 
2 of 5 essays done . That's just one class ! 
<3 Guess what , Tab ? \ 
Goin to your wake today . \ 
I love you , Girly-Pooh . 
Holy goodness . With all goin on this week I forgot to congratulate our boys ! You won state . I'm so proud of you and glad to be a < PROPMALE > of the year that did it ! Good job ! \ 
P.S. More cryin at the wake and tomorrow is the funeral . Ohhh Tab I love you so much and I miss you and want you back . I just wanna be with you again . Forever in my he < PROPMALE > babygirl . You were one of my best friend . =\\ <3 
So many people came to Tab's funeral . Thank you for the respect . I'm gonna miss her so much . She shouldn't be out of my life . The ones who love her shouldn't have had to watch you respect her like this . I have gotten so many hugs . But the one hug I'm used to getting when I'm sad was absent and will be till I join her . Seems like it's to long to wait but her hug and beauty and voice are worth it . Love you . =) <3 
Fuck . I think to myself \Maybe I'm finally getting better\ " then I look at pictures of you " 
Everytime I think about it , I can't believe it's true . It keeps hitting me over and over again . <3 Tab 
It's really really really starting to bother me and if people don't quit doing things like that soon I'm gonna get pissed/upset ! UGH\ 
<3 Tab 
Just did one of the stupidest things ever . Went back to my pictures with her in them and looked at her comments . I forgot about the one where I called her cute and we fought back and forth about it being lies and truth . She'll never post on my pictures again . \ 
Anyways out came the tears . ='( \ 
<3 Tab 
Starting to wonder why I do this to myself . Look at all the old stuff . At one point it was nice to remember now it's only painful . I see her profile and pictures and I realize again she's really completely gone . It's so heartbreaking . 
Oh for God's sake . \ 
Ugggghhhhh\ 
W . E . \ 
Everyone loved my coat today . \ 
Thanks , < PROPMALE > ! Love you ;) =P \ 
Hahahaha 
Not to horrible of a day today for once . \ 
I miss you though , Tabby . \ 
I hope < PROPFEMALE > ends up with who she belongs . I love you my baby niece . \ 
Not a bad day . \ 
Other than someone \forgetting\ " to inform me off their weekend plans 
Whatever .... I guess \ 
=( \ 
On the upside , I finally got good sleep though . \
