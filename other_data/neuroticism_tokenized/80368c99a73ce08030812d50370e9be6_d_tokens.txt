is leaving MONDAY !! feeling the affect of summer secrets && games ... fun&&love in the sun ... <3 a little afraid to have a meltdown ... 
is hoping she can sleep tonight ! feels she needs to get some things off her chest and stop holding them all inside . mega tired and a little sick !! =P 
is confused and upset ... wants to know what she is supposed to do ... doesn't want to leave ... 
is sitting in this chair trying to convince herself that it's going to be okay . It doesn't seem to be working so maybe she's made some mistake that she's going to regret or already regrets . When your this confused and internally scrambelled then it probably is a problem . She needs someone to talk to about it , but the only one she can talk to is herself . 
wants to know or make sure her heart is in the right place .... 
is pretty DANG sure she is doing what's RIGHT for HER !! .... FEELS a little SICK ! GAZZANIGO , tisk-tisk ! Misses her ' GOOD-LUCK CHARM'!! 
is extremely missin , that man she wants to be kissin , holding his hand , singing in his band , things she loves to do , hoping he loves it too ! poeticly perfect ! 
is happy , but wants tomorrow to come faster ! 
keeps procrastinating !! I need my motivation !! =P 
seems to be slowly drifting to the ground on a cloud .... definitely still falling for you hun ! 
is about to be picked up by the man she lets hold her hand !! haha =P ?? 
sitting here just waiting for it to get warm enough to actually get dressed and maybe go outside !! haha .... =P 
just finished mowing part of our huge lawn ... feels not so lazy now ! haha ! Feeling hopeful and almost excited about this whole forever thing ! hehe =P 
got her hair cut again !! haha . It's shorter this time though ! Was getting tired of all the weight on my head ! Now it won't get in the way so much anymore ! ;) 
is enjoying her day off from school ! Hoping she can spend most of it with her boo ! Also , listening to \everything\ " ? Te Amo Muy Mucho ? " 
loves the rain ... but you kinda get sick of it after it's been going 3 days non-stop ! It makes me lonely . I want to see my boo ... loves you ! ?? 
is really bored so she made some jibjab videos !! hahaha =P love you hubby !! 
realized that if you spend most of your time on the computer playing and taking care of virtual plants and parks and running around with your sisters and cousins shooting each other with nerf guns , playing nerf war , every man for themselves style , that you must be a complete and total DORK ... ah shoot , oh well ! hahaha ! =P 
auditioned for the school's musical and got a callback , along with < PROPFIRST > !! hehe . :) I feel accomplished !! 
is waiting for the cast to be posted for Wizard of Oz and has a callback for film club's movie production as one of the main roles ! Hope I get it !! 
is feeling a little bad , but then again it's their own faults ! Had another amazing day with my boo :) can't wait for our two month , this wednesday !!! <3 
is sad and crying , but also mad and yelling .... moments like these remind me how bipolar I really am .... hoping that someone's heart is softened .... missing her boo , happy two month ! 
is making christmas cards and little picture gifts for people !! It's a lazy but fun Saturday ! < PROPFEMALE > flew in last night from utah ! Dad , < PROPFIRST > , Dannel , and < PROPFEMALE > should be here sometime next week !! Yes < PROPFIRST > , you can meet all of them when they get here ! :P 
is a little irritated with the world ....... 
starting to believe that I have become afraid of commitment when it comes to relationships ... it's frustrating . 
has a lot to do and it's kinda stressful .... I can always count on my boo and facebook to help destress me ! 
is thinking + I cant seem 2 get out of my head . Decisions are hard + what has been said is said . One step at a time , take the days as they're here . Plan 4 the future + remember whats near . Live your days 2 the fullest but make no stupid mistakes+end up w/regrets . Because you'll have to pay 4 all those debts . Love is important+should be expressed every day . Make sure its done in a healthy + sweet way . 
is pretty dang bored ........ gotta find something to keep my mind busy so I don't get sad again ... facebook isn't working right now , probably about to get off for now .... 
had a fun night and is happy again , not fully , but not busting into tears every few minutes ! Had some of the girls over and < PROPMALE > out , we watched Cloudy with a < PROPMALE > of Meatballs ! haha . That movie is just hilarious !

hates it when people give you a hard time about something or forgetting something when they have no idea why or what's going on in your life ; first of all , they have no right to judge you , be mad at you , or talk bad about you in a \hushed tone . \ " That is a sign of true ignorance . "

MANHUNT !! 
is super tired from last night , but it was tons of fun ! :D hahaha still trying to fully wake up ... <3 
even with time ... not all wounds are healed ... 
... even with time memories are neither forgotten or erased , nor are they replaced ... the heart wants what the heart wants , even if what it wants it can't have , it will want anyway ... 
thinks that when you truly love someone you love them unconditionally , accept their flaws , help keep them strong , you love seeing them happy and being with them , you care for them with all your heart , and you never want to let them go ... <3 
had a fun day today , took a < PROPMALE > and it turned out good :) ... love can't be denied , it's unconditional , acceptance , happiness even with flaws , forgiveness , no regrets , no fears ... your love makes you happy , helps and supports you , strengthens , commits , honest , loving and caring , your best friend , the one you tell all your secrets to ... never forgotten ... 
just got home :D went out with mama today for my b-day , I had fun and got my hair did haha tonight was fun as well , pool party and a movie , all wrapped up with a nice ride home :) going to sleep happy ... let's hope it brings good dreams ... <3
