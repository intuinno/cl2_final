Keep your eyes open , hold tight to your convictions , give it all you've got , be resolute , and love without stopping . - 1st Corinthians 16:13 :) 
So let's do itfull of belief , confident that we're presentable inside and out . Let's keep a firm grip on the promises that keep us going . He always keeps his word . Let's see how inventive we can be in encouraging love and helping out , not avoiding worshiping together as some do but spurring each other on , especially as we see the big Day approaching . -Hebrews 10:23 :)
