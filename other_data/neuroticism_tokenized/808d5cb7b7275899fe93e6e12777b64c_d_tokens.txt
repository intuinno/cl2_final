Leadville just kinda sucked . I was lookin foward to somw fun but i just couldn't seem to enjoy much of it . 
I'm feeling the change in altitude . again . feeling like I'm suffocating and sick with a bad cold but still gonna get my butt to that concert 
how is it that when some are bored they can find something to do but i can't ?! 
if this is how summer is going to be , then i don't want any part of i t.t his freakin sucks . I feel quite ignored by many people . used by others.me?no more . 
things would be great if the stupid weather would be nice

I go to bed early cuz i am tired . About 45 mins later , i wake up . Understand that i am still tired of course . I am sitting in bed and a HUGE SPIDER RUNS ACROSS MY BED ! AH ! Now i don't want to sleep cuz i didn't get to kill and don't know where it went ... under my bed .

Summer has come to it's end . School is in session . Homework to follow and time to fly . \ 
I don't like this idea . 
two days until school ... good or bad ?.... both . 
sigh . thank goodness it's friday at least 
Some people are too blind to see that i do in fact know . I'm really not stupid ... 
I wonder why it takes so long to figure out if things are/will be good or not so much =) hoping for the best !! 
this sickness is like an excuse to sleep whenever i want to =) hehee . 
aahhh ... that would be a sigh of relief . except it's only cuz schools out . i'm so incredibly tired !!

Dear < PROPMALE > Bear , \ 
I will hunt you down . We will find out who you are .

two gas leaks . one day . bad smell . nasty ! 
always on my mind . he is a good distraction . the kind that keeps you going when you feel like giving up . the kind of support you need to make it through to the end of the cave you drove yourself into . love him =) 
Band and Color Guard rocked their performance tonight ! Loved it ! 
even after almost 16 years , this world remains a mystery to me . i look forward to the days ahead and hope for the best as i prepare for the worst . tomorrow is a new day so goodnight world 
I always have wanted people to listen to all the words i tell them before they assume and so they don't misinterpret what I'm saying . \I still have lost all of my friends because of everyone whinning about some bullshit with 10 fucking dollars\ " . This is not the reasoning behind the issue mentioned . That reasoning would be him leaving us . We lost him . He didn't lose us . We didn't tell him to " 
choose , we never told him to take a side . We were there for him but he never saw it and chose the one who would hurt him more than anyone else over us , who were always there . The matter is not about ten dollars . It is because he left us . It was a choice he made-to leave , to not listen , to ignore , to take the pain . 
All Hallows Eve ... HAPPY HALLOWEEN !! 
3 days until my birthday !! So excited ! 
Texas for winter break ? 
interesting day . ups and downs . i wish it could have been better but < PROPFIRST > Devinemade my birthday a good one . Thank you =) \ 
Hoping to go to Texas for my winter break to meet everyone ! 
As we walk among these shadows , in these streets , this field of battle \ 
Take it up , we wear the medal , raise your hands with burning candles \ 
Hear us whisper in the dark , hear in the rain you see the spark \ 
... \ 
walk alone against all we've ever known \ 
All we've ever really wanted was a place to call our home \ 
But you take all we are ; the innocence of our hearts \ 
Made to kneel before the alter as you tear us apart 
< PROPFEMALE > hates it when people i don't know try to add me as their friend on facebook . 
kayak across the pacific ocean ... and it's serious ?? 
Here we are , three years later , \ 
Still stuck beneath your hand , \ 
As you ruin my happily ever after . \ 
People like you should be confined , \ 
Locked away behind the iron bars , \ 
Never have seen that the sun had shined . \ 
I will never be the same , \ 
Only forever changed , \ 
Past and future overflown with shame . \ 
My strongest hate\ 
Exists entirely for you , \ 
Knowing you're lying in wait . \ 
What are you waiting for ? 
Another day in this carnival of souls\ 
Another night's sands end as quickly as it goes\ 
The memories are shadows , ink on the page\ 
And I can't seem to find my way home\ 
All the places I've been and things I've seen\ 
A million stories that made up a million shattered dreams\ 
The faces of people I'll never see again\ 
... your heaven's trying everything to break me down\ 
<3 FFDP-Far From Home 
we live in a cold dark world with venom in its fangs . you can spit it in my face but i know ill be ok . a ball and chain , chew my arm off to get away . dont fight , or it deny it , invite it cuz when it feels like a kick in the teeth i can take it . ur settin me free with one more kick in the teeth.im bleedin out the mouth . i hope u know im stronger now.im takin the hate , wont go down til im 6 feet underground 
Life is great for those of us who take it in stride 
lack of excitement really sucks on party day

Ahhh ... the end of 2010 at last =) welcome 2011 !! 
throughout my life i had all i believed i wanted and u came along and murdered me . you shattered my childhood , robbed my innocence , and tore my last threads of hope i held onto so dearly . People say to hold onto what i've got , but when it happens again and again , you know it is useless to try . This is where a person chooses to let go or stay strong . i've made my own different decision . 
red bull and gin 
how fantastic 
it is sad to look back at your old favorite TV shows and see that they were saying sexual things and promoting drugs . ( Scooby DOOBY doo ) 
Monster in law is hilarious ... just chillin =) 
If I gave you the truth , Would it keep you alive ? Though I'm closer to wrong , I'm no further from right . And now I'm convinced on the inside that something's wrong with me . No there's nothing you say that can salvage the lie . I'm trying to keep my intentions disguised . And now I'm deprived of my conscience and something's got to give . The deception you show is your own parasite . Just a word of advice you can heed if you like . 
\Your not sixteen ! \ " \ " yes i am\ " \ " but shes not sixteen and she's bigger than you\ " .... thanks alot little kid ... " 
I've never had a BigMac . I'd never go bungee jumping . I can throw a spiral football . I'm not dumber than < PROPFEMALE > Simpson . I didn't vote for Obama-I hate politics . I've never mooned anyone . I can do more than 20 push ups . I don't party too much-I don't even party . I do cry when I watch Titanic . I don't like blue eyes-I like brown and green-i don't really like blue anything . I could never be gangster ... i'm the whitest kid ever ? 
I guess life is as it always used to be .
