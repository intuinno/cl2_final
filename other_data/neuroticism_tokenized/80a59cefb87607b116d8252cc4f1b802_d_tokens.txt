solo raiding on facebook rocks :) 
I need people to pray for me . My doctor isn't 100% sure whats wrong with me . I dont have any energy in my body again . Each time I try something new which will hopefully give me energy , it will give me energy , but only temporarely . Tomorow , I am starting a new medication which will hopefully give me back my energy , motivation , and creativity . 
Woot !!! my new medication is working which means Wil almost has as much energy as he used to !!!......... for now .......... lets hope this one keeps working aye :) 
Yet again , another group of people think that I am a psychopathic stalker because they missunderstand my social awkwardness and niave mistakes ............ How I wish that I wasn't so \different \"." 
The last person just left my December 27th - January 1st anime/video game party . I haven't had that much fun in a long time . Now , I'm looking forward to Modern Physics , starting on the 5th . 
Will have internet in his apartment from anywhere between 1:00 P.M. and 5:00 P.M. , so he wont have to mooch off SWOSU's wifi anymore lol . 
WOOT WOOT !!! I gots internet now !!!!! :) 
Veronica : intriguing . Now , what word best describes Wil ? ^_^ 
Whats with you people and farmville lol ??? 
Wow lol , putting together kitchen tables and chairs from part to part is so frustrating >_< . 
Wow , I have met way too many people who were in a bad mood today . I saw like 10 people today who looked at me as if they wanted the worst for me . :( 
I dont know about you guys , but I think that @ < PROPMALE > is obviously a LHer ( Life hacker ) . What do the rest of you think ??!!?!?!?? 
YEHHESSS !!!! This is the first time I have actually been challenged in a physics course because , this time , I had to spend alot of time thinking about and figuring out how to do the physics work that was assigned in class !!!!!!!! My 1 and 1/2 years of waiting has finally paid off :) 
Actually enjoys working with classical mechanics for the first time lol . 
ZOMG !!! 1/2 of my FB friends are online right now !!! Thats the beuty of only letting 10 - 20 peeps be FB friends lol 
< PROPMALE > Chase : \is calling a weatherman fail for tomorrow just watch lol\ " What do you think ? " 
I dont know about you < PROPMALE > , but I am thinking that this is a \not weatherman fail\ " . :) " 
WOOT !!! My dad made a FB lol . Now I'm gonna have to watch what I say on this thing ^_^ . 
< PROPMALE > ....... you suck !!! >.< 
I got these off of the urban dictionary when I searched \Wil \"" 
God bless the photons and neutrinos that have removed the slush today on the side streets of which I walk on to get to class . :) 
Enjoys this type of winter weather . 
It's < PROPFIRST>'s Week on Facebook . Change your profile picture to a picture of you with your significant other and tell us how long you've been together . Wil + < PROPMALE > <---------------------------- 472 years and recently engaged . :) 
OMG !!! Just got done with an epic physics homework group session . We finished all of the online homework 5 minutes before it was due . :) 
Today has been fantastic !!! I love thinking abstractly then helping others understand what I understand and learning from what others understand ( intellectual conversations ) . College is the beez neez . :) 
Wow , you know its bad when you buy only one type of fish on fish world , so you know the type of fish that one of your family members had stolen from you lol . However , I do admit . This has defiantly made fish world way more fun !! 
Wow , I am so blessed to have a musical talent that I share to honor America’s departed veterans . 
Contour seats and back jeans pockets should be abolished from the US constitution for interfering with my sciatic nerve rights . =P 
I joined a cause on FB , so I could post something logical , of which was in great need , on it's wall , and now I want to leave the cause . How do I do this ? 
By the Ocean breath induced vomiting curves space for chicken breast layered laptop processes in linux ? 
Wow , I feel about as chirpy as an emo kid after his ecstasy wore off . Thus , sleep will commence in about 10 minutes . 
woot , its almost 12:00 A . M .. My couple of hours of waiting will pay off when I find that I am the first to say \Happy Birthday\ " on my General Physics 1 professors wall on his actual birthday . ^_^ " 
Wil got a new phone , WOOT WOOT !!!! 
uhg !!! I hate how some of these newer pages on FB some how get someone to mass send requests to all of their friends >.< . I guess I can no longer trust some of the stuff that I click on in FB anymore . :( 
Ohhhhh Yahhhh , trolling very conservative webpages with tons of intolerably insecure people makes my day . :) 
The only way one can “begin to approach” an understanding of Wil's ways is if he or she is as mad as a hatter who was already mad before he or she began hatting . 
The amount of money Wil will have to spend towards fixing his car ....... \ 
$750 < $### < $1000\ 
\ 
Any guesses ??? Who ever is closest to being right will get a prize !!! :) 
WOOT WOOT !!!! I can finally get off that crappy vyvanse and get back on good old Ritalin once more . ^_^ 
omgsh lol .......... I played WoW with a couple a friends of mine , and this Finnish girl tagged along . We all got on skype , then ............. I found out that I have no other choice but to marry a girl with a Finnish accent because I have fell in love with Finnish accents . One could say that I developed a \Finnish fetish\ " ROFLCOPTER !!! " 
The other day , my 17 month old niece gave her father ( being my youngest older brother ) 3 of her shoes . Her father put 2 of the matching shoes on her feet , but she was mad that he didn't put the third shoe on one of her feet ROFLCOPTER !!! Clearly , this lack of natural mathematical aptitude came from my niece's , mother's side of the family :) . 
OMG !!!!!!! Wil 1 , < PROPMALE > 234523452345 .............. nope ....... I was wrong ............ < PROPMALE > 234523452345 , Wil 0 >.< 
Criticism should be in abundance . How else can one improve in an area , when he or she is unaware of the defect , without criticism of some form ? 
this is great lol . \

That is why The Flying Spaghetti Monster made lemons . Most people will try and make lemon juice out of them , but the smart ones know that no matter how much sugar you put in lemon juice , it will always be as bitter as chewing up xanex . That’s why the smart ones give the lemons to the less mindfully inclined , so they can laugh at their anguish < insert : “sarcasm” > . =D 
This was said by a wise friend of mine . \ 
\Id like to thank satan cause you know if he wasnt there god would probably get bored and blow his brains out . XD \"" 
He was a funny guy , and through his humor , he made High School a more habitable place . I really enjoyed the time I spent with him in High School , so he will not be forgotten , < PROPMALE > , a < PROPMALE > of mine since Elementary School . \ 
Anyone that is Mourning < PROPMALE>'s passing can give me a call at 405-315-1289 . I will try and give you as much emotional support as I can . 
Its weired . I thought that when you go to college there were more peers out there that would appreciate the way you are . For me , there were more in High School but now one of them is dead . fml

WOOT !!! I just got done cleaning out my friends list . If you are seeing this post , then congratz . :) 
Just found out that abortions are on clearance at Wallmart . Peeps need to hit up those sweet deals before they are out of stock LAWL !!! 
test 
Just found out that the bible endorses abortion for various situations . Plus , states that only the Christian God knows when an embryo acquires a soul . Thus , anyone who declares a time when an unborn child gets a soul is blasphemous . ( lawls at the tea party movement ^_^ )\

Today was the first day that I felt a little hopeful since < PROPMALE > died . Now , I'm actually looking forward to school starting up in a couple weeks . Thanks for being supportive peeps :) . 
Cant wait until his affliction lock can start melting some faces . 
Just found out that in 1999 , 20 percent of American adults were \certain\ " that the Sun revolved around the Earth . ( silently lawls inside ) " 
Went to the observatory with hopes of solving a year long problem but found out that its gonna take more than a few hours of independent research through manuals and internet forums to solve this one lol . It looks like its time to hit the books again , so hopefully , I can get closer to figuring this one out for the next time I apply what I have learned . 
I've made a couple goals for the my Physics research , one being by mid October and the other by the end of the Fall semester . I'm hoping they aren't too unreasonable lol . 
Thank you storm for making the power surge every 5 - 10 minutes . Now , it's an even greater challenge to do my online homework >.< . 
Poor football player :( . Though , I could see myself making a similar mistake lol . \

Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs , and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots . So far , the Universe is winning . - < PROPMALE > Cook 
Just found out that one of my friends is officially a daddy , WOOT WOOT !!! I'm so proud of that guy . 
\Grieve all your hearts out and she'll writhe enthralled In tragic ecstatic agony\ " \ 
Youtube vids like this make paranoid people like me even more paranoid lol . \

Just found out that the classes he needs to take for his majors are conflicting for the next semester . Plus , one of those classes is at 8:00 A.M. which = BAD lol >.< . 
\Any man who reads too much and uses his own brain too little falls into lazy habits of thinking \"" 
Loves how he can take certain medications at such high doses that it would stagger your average horse ( obvious exaggeration ) but doesn't even make him a little drowsy . 
If you find any senatorial or presidential candidates that are socially liberal and economically conservative , then please let me know . 
I wanna turn into a manbeartree . Got any advice ? 
Wil sayeth : \All mighty Maximdl 
One is not crazy until his or her crazyness is > = Wil's crazyness =P 
is really considering becoming a manbeartree . Come on peeps , I need some advice here . 
After a long debate with the people inside my head , we took vote and decided it was time I should buy a knife . :) 
Some could say that I'm a \dry humor with mono tone voice\ " < PROPMALE > and a \ " relentless sarcastic remarks\ " minor . =P " 
I win at the absent mindedness game today . I just went outside to get inside my car when I noticed that my car wasn't in the parking lot . I retraced my steps which brought me to the hutch's near my apartment . I noticed that my car was still at the gas pump where I left it a few hours ago . LAWL !!! 
Check out my most recent astro photo . I really put some work into this one 
I'm really hopeing that what ever bug I caught flies off before finals start . 
I really wish I wasn't so dependent on my medication . All it takes is getting sick for awhile , then I get thrown off course for over half a month . Atleast , now my doctor and I have a plan figured out , so I can make sure I can continue to get my medication in my body , even though I'm sick . 
Facebook , you are allowed to change profile < PROPFEMALE > designs once a year , not once every season >.< . 
Just got done getting all of the light images I wanted for the Great Nebula of Orion . Now I'm working on the dark and bias images . I sure hope this comes out as well as I am expecting . Hopefully , the color will come out better than it did with Andromeda lol . 
Hates to say it , but found out that Lady Gaga can sing a pretty decent live performance . 
Hey there peeps , check out my most recent astro photo . I put a lot of effort into this one . 
I currently do not have a psychiatrist . All of those years of hard work and pure positive attitude will go down the drain in the next couple of months unless I find another one that accepts my insurance and doesn't live 920837498723 < PROPMALE > away . so ridiculously stressed out right now . 
Dear Einstein , Thank you for proving that I'm always right . :) 
I have good news !! I officially have a psychiatrist that accepts my health insurance , and I know this one is good because a family member of mine used to have her and said that family member said she is a good one . Now I don't have to worry about being put in a loony bin a few months down the road . WOOT WOOT !! :P 
Using an St8-XME SBIG camera at the observatory , $5000\ 
Buying airborne to prevent getting sick while being out in the cold at night at the observatory , $6\ 
Catching a bug because you forget to use airborne before you went out to the observatory on cold night , priceless 
Wishes his facial hair grew like it did when he was 12 >_< . Then , he wouldn't need to shave but once every couple of weeks lol . 
Tonights mission was the Crab nebula ( M1 ) . I just got done taking all of the light images and am now working on the dark frames . I'm hoping to do well in the astro photography competition for this month with this picture . I'll be posting my best processed image some time today . 
Check out my new astro photo . It is the crab nebula ! 
just submitted the crab nebula image that received the most votes . I sure hope I get in the top 5 . 
I sure could use some snow , several inches of snow . Weather peeps , don't be wrong !!!
