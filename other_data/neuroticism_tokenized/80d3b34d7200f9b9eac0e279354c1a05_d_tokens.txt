Let your yea's be yea and you no's be no ... \Jesus Christ\ " said it " 
Message from God to the world ... Yes , of course , you want to control so everything happens in just the \ 
way you want it . But at the end of the day , we control nothing , - it's \ 
all in God's hands , - has always been , and will always be . So , do what \ 
you can , and then let go , and let God handle the rest . 
May God bless all who read this and i'll keep y'all in my prayers :) 
If you want me to pray for you or your family , let me know in a message what it is thats on your mind . Double the faith gets Jesus ' attention :)

Great day man ... over all great day :) 
Pay day tomorrow 
Pretty tight day yesterday , I got paid for dancing and partying lol yessss ! 
Why is gospel and soul so good to me man ... I need an ipod 
Love God ... Love People ... Every body , Love Somebody .. The greatest commandment of all time 
There's a concept im trying to understanding .. God reigns over all ( over all ) pretty exciting if you ask me , better him than any man 
Lets get some POWER !!!!!! 
Lesson in life : Forgive to be Forgiven by God 
Lesson in Life : Pray . God always listens . Repent and He will forgive you . Meditate in HIS LOVE , its the greatest thing we will ever discover . 
Lesson in Life : Faith gets Gods ' attention . How we act upon our faith is what gives us MIRACLES . Show God you love Him , and He will do the same to you . :) 
Lesson in Life : Allow yourself to be taught and to learn . Everything points to Jesus , open your eyes and see his beauty all around you . Every second he shows up , receive his love . :) 
Lesson in Life : Whats next for you in life ? Well you have two options ; Live life miserable and void , or you could accept Jesus and have the best life there ever is . Christ Jesus is waiting and will always receive you into His family . 
Eating some asian left overs , Sorry D lol it taste good 
Chill day , cleaned and ate not that bad .. Monday tomorrow , all that means is another day i have to train 
Chillen jamming out on the guitar .. Trainings going good .. Thank God im alive 
Let's get this over with .. 
Names of God are many , The one that we could all relate to is Love . He shows us his love when really we did nothing to deserve it . He's real amazing too if you put it that way . 
Another day , another lesson 
Growth is in the internal , very little is it in the external . To grow spiritually is to grow wiser and stronger . Jesus aids us in this process for it does not come over night . Grab onto His hand and His love so that you may see who he really is . 
I don't mean it in a bad way buuutt .. The freaks come out at night .... more people get on facebook at night than in the day time lol 
Christmas , a time to count your blessings and a time to reflect on the greatest one of all time ; Jesus ' birthday . His life has given us hope . 
Learning .. Training .. Stretching 
Im waiting on the Lord because he has something for me .. What it is he's giving i don't know but its got to be good . 
Auburn .. man that was a craaazY game 
Abuelita tus refranes me hace reir ... yo te quiero yo te adoro , es que tu eres mi unico tesoro .. Para mis dos abuelas bellas 
United Bboy jam tommorow its gonna be dope .. o and check out the new video of me and the black lady lol its kinda funny 
All God wants to show is his Mercy and Love . We walk away from him and all he says is he'll forget about it all UNTILL we run back and seek him with our WHOLE heart :) 
here at Pine Cove loving everything here . People are great and God is even Greater :) 
what can God do for people ?? He can Love you like no man can ever love . He will love you Today ! :) 
Thought : All this world will pass .... What am i doing with my life 
I tried to direct myself , man did i crash and hit the ground hard . \ 
I looked up and recieved health , and love that would never depart\
