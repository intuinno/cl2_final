Why am I so tired ? - You think with the time going backwards I should be good . 
Use to cooking myself - my mother who is into eating out made reservations for Governors - everybody cancelled the day before because of sick grandkids - so it went down to the restaurant =3 me , Mum , & Rici - Mum called 2 hours before the meal and said she was ill - I went and Rici met me with my forth daughter ( I adopted her ) for pie I had steak - AH well

Supreme court is a bunch of morons - No common sense -First they say it is OK to buy off politicians by corporate donations - now they say it is ok to make and purchase video regarding cruelty to animals under \freedom of speech\ " the only judge that voted against the ruling was Atila ( can't believe I agree with him ) . What's next child porn under \ " freedom of speech \""

OK - Watching Rozzelli & Isle - only problem \Hoyt\ " is a serial killer - most shows based in Boston \ " Hoyt\ " is usually the cop - WTH " 
OK - definitely not a \Hoyt\ " way to small boned " 
Wishing the best for both my sisters-in-laws - one is on life support the other down there in Florida trying to make the right decision - really sucks to be in that position - bless you both and pray for you - love you both - I can't imagine 
Nite all - past my pumpkin time 
OK - I was wrong again - I thought 83 degress at 8:30 would be hotter than PC no they are 85 - than I thought maybe not all wrong it is only 7:30 there . 
Whoa down to 79 outside - time to open the windows 
He who laughs last thinks slowest . 
We are getting good - down to 75 - I think I'll run outside butt naked around the house - like this old lady has that much energy - I doubt it 
Nite all - pumpkin time 
I'm sad to say my sister-in-law passed this morning - bless her sweet loving soul - she will be sadly missed by all that she touched . RIP < PROPFEMALE > we love you . 
I feel like I'm diagonally parked in a parallel universe . 
well nite all it is pumpkin time 
Despite the cost of living , have you noticed how it remains so popular ? 
It is hard to understand how a cemetery raised its burial cost and blamed it on the cost of living . 
Oops pumpkin time nite all 
You have the right to remain silent . Anything you say will be misquoted , then used against you . 
I just got lost in thought . It was unfamiliar territory . 
I wish Heaven had a phone so I could hear your voice again . I thought of you today , but that is nothing new , I thought about you yesterday , and days before that too . I think of you in silence , I often speak your name . All I have are memories and a picture in a frame . Your memory is a keepsake , from which I'll never part . God has you in his arms , I have you in my heart ..... Repost if you have someone in Heaven 
Last week I whined about the heat - now I am whining about the coolness - I guess there is no pleasing me weather wise

All right - first 3 minutes NO touchdown 
My middle daughter painted her room a burgundy and is now mablelizing it with a pale grey & blue - she has been at it since 7 this morning - ah wish I had that energy - I remember the feeling - don't stop until you done -

a person who earns $ 106,800 a year pays in $6600 a yr ....... and person who earns $ 10,000,000 a year pays in $6600 a yr . \ 
so while the first person pays in 6% , the 2nd pays in 0.0006%

Sea Island spokesman < PROPFIRST > Geczi said Monday evening that the deal was reached after eight hours of negotitions . 
Sorry it is two parts - If a bankruptcy judge approves the sale , Sea Island's resorts , golf courses and private clubs will have four partners sharing ownership . \

Watching 60 minutes - so sad all the people out of jobs and have used up their 401k's - I suppose I should be thankful I still have a job - even though because of health insurance I took a 2000 dollar hit - and income is cut in half by my husband's death - my nest egg gone I think I can still eke out a living - just praying the winter is not too hard - Hopefully I will not have to touch my 401k -

I decided the critics are right - \Men of A Certain Age\ " is a very good show - took awhile to grow on me but it is good . " 
Wow a wind gust just blew the screen out f the window - It is a sign should have taken the screens out in late September or early October when all bugs are gone - but the warm weather we had in November I still had bugs hitting my windshield

Well nite to all - busy day with last minute shopping 
Every Christmas you always hear people saying what they want and bought . Well this is what i want , i want people who are sick with no cure to be able to be cured .

I have a feeling I am gonna see almost no re-post . 
Well < PROPFIRST>'s just bearly did it - Go < PROPFIRST>'s 
Neato Robotic Vacuum - The Neato uses a technology similar to what is being used in self-driving cars , and it is a real vacuum cleaner , so it actually vacuums up the dirt , it doesn’t just try to sweep it in . This means it looks around the room , figures out how to best cover the space , and then it executes a plan . Personally I think it is smarter than most politicians . If I could , I’d vote it into office . 
JFK'S Secretary of State , < PROPFIRST > Rusk , was in < PROPFEMALE > in the early 60's when DeGaule decided to pull out of NATO . DeGaule said he wanted all US military out of < PROPFEMALE > as soon as possible .. \

It takes 7 seconds for food to pass from mouth to stomach . A human hair can hold 3kg . The length of a penis is 3x the length of the thumb . The femur is as hard as concrete . A woman's heart beats faster then a man's . Women blink 2x as much as men . We use 300 muscles just to keep our balance when we stand . The woman has read this entire text . The man is still looking at his thumb . Repost if this made you smile ...

Please copy and paste to your status if you know someone or have been affected by someone who needs a foot up their ass . People who need a foot up their ass affect the lives of many . There is still no cure for someone who needs a foot up their ass , except a foot up their ass . Please help raise awareness as 93% of people won't re-post this . Why ? Because they probably need a foot up their ass too . Thanks :-)

Swore off anything HFCS this year Just realized my coffee creamer contains just that - so made my own - one can sweetened condensed milk ( they use sugar ) almost 3 cups half/half one tablespoon vanilla ( preferably Madagscar Bourbon Vanilla ) Man just sweetened my coffee ( Colombian ) the best ( and chemical free )

Doesn't make much sense , does it ?? : Homeless go without eating . Elderly go without needed medicines . Mentally ill go without treatment . Troops go without proper equipment .

I'm a little boy with glasses , the one they call a geek ; a little girl who never smiles cause I've got braces on my teeth . I'm that kid on every playground who is always chosen last ; you don't have to be my friend , but is it too much to ask : don't laugh at me , don't call me names , don't get your pleasure from my pain ? In God's eyes we're all the same . REPOST for bully awareness
