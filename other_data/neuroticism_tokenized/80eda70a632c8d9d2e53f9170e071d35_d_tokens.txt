Just when you think you can't possibly love your child any more than you already do .... think again ! My love for my son continues to grow more with each and every day , and as we walk through every stage in this life together , the good times and the bad ... what really matters is what we learn , and how we grow from these experiences .. and knowing that nothing will ever break this most amazing bond between my son and I ! 
Is it really possible to be so overhwlemed with so many different emotions all at once that you're not even sure how you feel ...??? I think it is ...

So we lost the first game , and won the second ... I am proud to say that the Renal Sluggers finished 5-3 , took 3rd place !!! GREAT job team !!! Second season starts in two weeks ... can't wait ! =) 
Pretty sad when the people at the junk yard know me by name , AND what parts I need on my jeep ... when I'm not even driving my jeep !?!?! lol ! 
FINALLY on the road , headed out for some fun and a much needed break away ! =) 
Missing my little man ... :-/ No loud music , no arguing , no asking for\ 
money ... ( and then some more money ! ) ... a ride here , a ride there .... \ 
It's going to be a very long 4 weeks ... 
Work ??? Huh ??? What's that ?! O-o -o-h-h-h ... That's what I'm supposed to be doing here ?!?! 
Once again , a typical Monday ... BS , BS and some more BS !

16 years ago today , I was blessed with the most amazing gift ever ... \ 
can’t believe how fast time goes by ... \ 
HAPPY 16th BIRTHDAY to my most awesome little man !!! =) 
“One day at a time ... this is enough . Do not look back and grieve over the past for it is gone ; and do not be troubled about the future , for it has not yet come . Live in the present , and make it so beautiful it will be worth remembering . ” 
I'm a simple girl really ... don't need fancy things , pretty low maintenance , not too picky ... but some central air right about NOW would be SO nice !!! 
Can't wait to get home and see my Devan !!! =) It's been a long 2 1/2 weeks without him here ! 
All this rain makes me wanna .... 
Not only did he ask ME , he's paying AND driving ! Heading to a movie , just Devan and I ... What more could a mom ask for !?!? LIFE IS GOOD ! =) 
SO looking forward to the weekend just hanging with Dev and playing me some softball ! =) 
Ok ... Alarm is set for 4:50 am , which allows me to hit snooze two times , but ONLY two times ! Tomorrow is the day ... I can do this ! :-) 
Devan got called for his first job interview today !!! SO excited for him !!! I think I'm more nervous than he is !?!? =) 
Dev just got hired for his first real job , after his very first interview ever ! He starts Sunday ! YAY !!! I am SOOOOOO proud of my boy !!! 
Southern Voice Tour ... here we come .. You ain't seen crazy yet !!! 
Would love to get out a smack the idiots who think it's cool to turn their base up SO loud that all you hear is the rattling vibration of their POS with spinners ... Really ?!?! I'll just stop here before offend someone ... Then again , ask me if I care ... Not so much . 
<3 Nothing lasts forever , so live it up , drink it down , laugh it off ! Avoid the BS , take chances , and NEVER have regrets ... because at one point , everything you did was exactly what you wanted <3 
Geared up and Beered up for some softball !

Well , I successfully changed my oil , replaced my air filter and topped off all my fluids . The only mishap was dipping my ponytail in the oil pan ! :-/ Now off to Ordville to work cattle with the family for the rest of the weekend ! Fun , Fun !!! 
~ <3 What lies behind us , and what lies before us are < PROPFEMALE > matters compared to what lies within us ~ Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take but by the moments that take our breath away ~ Do not go where the path may lead , go instead where there is no path , and leave a trail ! ~ Remember life's treasures are people , not things ~ Remember that something incredibly wonderful is always possible <3 ~ 
~ Remember , Life is a precious gift , love is a wonderful gift , and laughter is a glorious gift . So live life to the fullest , love with all your heart , and laugh as\ 
much as you breathe ~

Develop your character , for it becomes your < PROPFEMALE > . ~ Loved this one ... had to steal it ( thanks < PROPFEMALE >!) =) 
~ <3 ~ To get something you never had , you have to do something you never did . When God takes something from your grasp , he's not punishing you , but merely opening your hands to receive something better . The will of God will never take you where the grace of God will not protect you ~ <3 ~
