No one should be frozen in carbonite , or be slowly digested for a thousand years in the bowels of a sarlaac , just because they couldn't pay Jabba the Hutt what they owe him . If you agree , post this as your status .

Dragons are nearly unstoppable and , in case you didn't know , they can breathe fire . 93% of people won'tcopy and paste this , because they have already been eaten by dragons . 6% of people are sitting in the shower armed with fire extinguishers , whilst the remaining 1% are awesome and will repost this !
