Okay , SO .... I'm audition fot the national honor orchestra this month ...... and , surprisingly , I'm not nervous at all . I still need to work on my solo ... well I actually need to decide what I want to play first . Then , I need a resume .... oh wonderful . More to worry about . If I make it in , it will be the best experiance of my life . Can't wait !!! I'll be the happiest person alive . Haha . Music is definetly my future . =) 
Music theory needs to go die !!! No matter how hard I try , I always do horrible on my tests . I want to improve!!!!I'm glad we're working on intervals cause uts so easy . Maybe I'll actually get 100% on it . I actually considered going back to silverado next year . I was having such a horrible day . 
Working on Paudert for a master class this week . =) 
I've decided that I'm gonna play Franz Strauss Op . 8 for the LV < PROPMALE > Young Artists Competition . I really enjoyed the master class with J.D. Shaw the other day . =) 
Well ... I didn't make The National Honor Orchestra , but I didn't expect it anways .... thats for amazing musicians to be in , and I'm no where near their level . =/ 
This is getting ridiculous . I need a silent brass mute NOW . D: 
There is no such thing as time . Think about it .... 
2011 , you're going down . ;) 
Honor Band was amazing . My solo apparently sounded good too , but that's not my opinion . I thought I sounded gross . 
Everyone these days are so materialistic and greedy . They need to Learn the true meaning of life . I have , HAVE YOU ? 
Wow , apparently my cousin is a beast at Sax . =) Way to go , Rad !!! 
I gave money to a hobo today =) . 
London Phil ........ hmmmm ....... 
Just < PROPMALE > out with my BEST FRIEND !!! Jenna I love you !!! <3

My lips are dead from honor band . =/ Concert tomorrow at UNLV !! You should all come !!! 
Honor band concert was INTENSE . =P 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUYnz_r2aaY 
I think I've overloaded myself with so many ensembles and rehersals for different things that I haven't been paying attention to my grades . =/ This is stressful . I never thought I would do this , but I'm doing 2 rehersal on the same day every week plus all the school practicices and my practicing at home ... Handbells , Mariachi , and all of that . I'm not dropping any of it though .. I love my insturment too much . 
I had my all-state audition today and it went PERFECT . Except the recording while I was doing my second song didn't work , so I had to record it again and it sounded TERRIBLE . That's totally unfair . I wanted my first chair in orchestra and because of technical difficulties , there's a possibility that I didn't get it . =((((( 
I wish people understood how much I like him . How do you know when you're in love ? Jazz audition tomorrow !!!! 
I might be in top Jazz band !!! Yay !!! 
I can't wait until horn choir !!! Haha I'm such a dork , but heyyy , who cares !??! I love the pictures during the Midwest trip , < PROPFIRST > !!! 
I HATE academics , but I absolutely LOVE music . 
< PROPFEMALE > , you are a true friend . You too , Chy , and Hunter . =P No one comes around those type of people , that often , in their lifetime . 
I want to PLAY MY HORN !!!! I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS STUPID ESSSSAAAYYYY !!! LOOKS LIKE I'M GONNA BE UP ALL NIGHT PRACTICING . Sounds like fun . 
I'm dead tired , but I'm glad I finished my essay .... now I need to practice my horn ... I'm thrilled . 
I'm READY for both rehersals after school today !!!!! Well , actually , I'm not really looking foward to West Side Story , but , hey , what can you do ? 
Well , the Doctoral recital was today !!! Done with that !! Now , tomorrow I have a concert with < PROPFIRST > Bliss at LVA , 2:00 pm !!! Can't wait !! I love being so busy !!! 
< PROPFEMALE > just told me to wear black garbage bags to the concert , should I ? I don't know what else to wear . LMAO 
Practicing my horn . See ya !!!! 
< PROPFIRST > Bliss Sounded AMAZING !!! I really enjoyed his performance . He's cute too . Haha 
I'm having a very productive conversation with Bowen , for once . Jeez , I'm glad all that is over now . I wish I could play my horn on the < PROPFEMALE > . Do you know how entertaining that means to me ? The only thing is , sound doesn't travel in space . It's just a big thing of nothingness .

I am NOT in a good mood right now . >=/ 
I am NOT in a good mood right now . >=/ I hate people . 
I'm sorry , but I'm a leader , not a follower . >=/ 
Just speaking the truth , < PROPMALE > . Get over it . 
< PROPFEMALE > , you have to make my cookies EXTRA big , when my B-Day comes around . Just cause I'm a brass player , you know ... 
I got more songs to play to upload on youtube . Can't wait !!! 
I'm gonna go practice now . See ya !!! 
hmmm , LVYWO wasn't that great today , but horn choir was intense . My duet with < PROPFEMALE > is coming along , but we do have some shakey parts we need to polish up . I'm gonna get my Mariachi music soon . I love mondays . 
ugh long tones ... you gotta love ' em . 
Okay , I DO NOT agree with seniority . It should go by ABILITY LEVEL !!! 
Have I lost interest in it ? I haven't practiced that much lately . Ugh , this is depressing . =/ 
Heyyy !!! Solo Ensemble is Tomorrow @ < PROPMALE > HS !!! My Horn duet is at 8:00 am and my woodwind quintet is at 2:10 pm . You should watch !!! My quintet is playing \Pastorale\ " by Beethoveen ... I think . " 
Heyyy !!! Solo Ensemble is Tomorrow @ < PROPMALE > HS !!! My Horn duet is at 8:00 am and my woodwind quintet is at 2:10 pm . You should watch !!! My quintet is playing \Pastorale\ " by Persichetti ... a very abstract piece . =P " 
I got a 2 on my horn duet .... next year I'm not gonna choose such an intense piece . I want to get a 1 on my quintet !!! No , I will get a one on my quintet !!! I wanna make it all the way to state !!! Come and watch it @ < PROPMALE > HS at 2:10 PM !!! 
I am very Depressed . 
I'm just gonna do a solo for solo ensemble next year . I can't depend on anyone , apparently , to earn a 1 . I'm depressed as hell . 
Well I'm done glooming over solo ensemble . It's Valentines Day and I'm gonna make the most of it . And besides , I'm gonna find out All-State results in two days !!! 
Hmmm , What am I doing today ? Any ideas ? 
Okay , I'm definetly gonna practice ALL DAY today !!!! I already missed a day . =( All-State results tomorrow !!!! 
So I'm guessing the results aren't coming today ... Thanks for getting my hopes up < PROPMALE >!!!!!=/ 
I loved playing the West Side Story solo today . It was pretty exciting . Now , I can finally relax and do my homework ..... while I'm on facebook . 
The concert wasn't our best today , but the Puccini sounded pretty good . 
I'm Not \grounded\ " anymore !!! Ooooh I love life !!! =) " 
I need to start practicing trumpet again .... I'll start next week ... CAN'T WAIT !!! =) 
I'm frustrated . There's a girl in Spain that is my age and is WAAAAAAY better than me at horn , but I mean , she has been playing since she was 7 . I wish my parents would've started me in music that early . She's a very talented musician . =) 
@ < PROPFEMALE>'s house !!! I'm definetily gonna start eating healthier ...... tomorrow .. 
Watched Casino Royale w/ tons of amazing people today!!!I'm at nicoles house right now !!! Good night !! 
I love life .

Dear All-State People in Charge of Posting the Results : POST IT UP ALREADY !!! Sincerely , Everyone . I don't understand why you have to keep us waiting ?!?!? Just put it on the freakin website !!! 
< PROPMALE > scared the crap outta me just now . He said Bri and < PROPFEMALE > were in orch and nima was 1st in band and I was 2nd ... oh god DONT EVER DO THAT AGAIN !!! It was fake though .... just so you know ... 
First in All-State Orchestra sounds nice right now . I'm enjoying the thought . 
Good Night , Everyone !!! See you all tomorrow . Good Luck w/ All-State !!! 
I am not in a good mood . Second chair overall in All-State , but they switch out the horns , so I had to be first in band . I'm going to practice ALOT over the summer so no one can catch up to . I have a lot of motivation right now . Competition makes my blood boil to the point when I HAVE to get what I want ! >=/ 
I'm really enjoying west side rehersal now . =) I also am having a good time reading farenheit 451 . That book is SO crazy !!! 
I just finished watching our honor band play \The Roosters Lay Eggs in Kansas\ " . I find it amusing how fast the trumpets sprang from their seats and started playing their soli . =D " 
So , West Side rehersals and performances , Orchestra Festival , Band Pre-Fest , Band Festival , Band trip to California , and All-State , anything else ? 
I just had an amzing conversation with my cousin , Rad !!! Good night !!! I am finally content .... 
Hmmm , American Salute ? I remember playing that song in LVYO last year . I should find the song online .... 
So , I looked into Berkley for over the summer , but then I realized .... I'm broke . =/ I wanted to go there for Jazz Horn .... oh well . 
I wonder what type of fish are on the VERY bottom of the sea . Probably some prehistoric creaures of some sort . =/ Who knows .... 
Today should be interesting . My parents wanna look at houses in the Bonanza HS area . Then we're gonna go to Borders , and maybe the mall . I love spending time with my family . =) I don't get to do this that much .... to busy with school . ;) 
I really hope she's not . Sh'es one of my good friends , and I had no idea she was like that .... that's life . I tried my best to show her .....

Okay so we're playing Angels in the Architecture for All-State and that is pretty much my favorite song . I am SO glad I'm in All-State Band this year . All of our songs are very intense . 2 more weeks ..... I think I'm gonna choose band again next year . =D

I just got back from my lesson , and I have to say I really had a good time and I learned alot about myself too ..... I can't keep time to save my life . XD 
\Ambition is a powerful motivation and can lead you into conflict if you let it get out of control ; relax . \ " Someone told me that while ago .... I should probaly listen to them ... "

So uh , my audition went terrible , but my sightreading was amazing . 
I'm composing at the moment , and this piece is definetly one of my better ones ... 
So , uh , I finally found my answer I've been looking for .... I kind of expected it the whole time though . That is the worst feeling anyone could ever get hit with . I hope no one ever has to feel this way .... I wish nothing but good for people , regardless of how much I hate them . 
So , my brother is walking around in my mom's high heeled boots .... Its probably the funniest thing I have seen . :)

< PROPFIRST > Brain was killed in a road accident while driving back from the Edinburgh Festival in his Triumph Sports Car , in August 1957 . The following day he was due to play in a recording of Strauss ' opera Capriccio and to this day some people still erroneously believe that he can be heard in this recording , which was conducted by Wolfgang Sawallisch . That's so creepy ... to bad it's not true ... XD 
Well , Sundays were supposed to be the days I don't play my Horn at all , but ... uuhhh I couldn't resist . :) It's like an addiction .

The Community Band concert went well last night , but the wind blew my music over a few times , and I didn't enjoy that . :D 
As I rode through the lonely road I discovered marshland in the middle of the desert , and somehow ended up in Shoshone , California . My journey ended there and we traveled back to Las Vegas , but on the way , we got some Beef Jerky ( Deer Meat , Pepper Flavored ) , and then we came home . 
WOOOO ! I hit an F above the STAAAAFFFFF !!! LIFE IS SOOO GOOODDD ! Happy Fourth of July ! Speaking of fourth .... I raised my range up by a 4th during this summer ! XD Music theory !

Hey guyyysss ! I grew like an inch this summer ! Mission accomplished ! :D 
Going to the Gym . Just got a membership today ! :D 
Cycling tomorrrooowwwww morning !! 
Keeping strong motivation for two completely different , big , goals is tough . It's difficult to balance it . 
UGHHH !!! I couldn't even do 30 push ups after our run today ?!? I lost all of my muscle ! >:( 
Oh jeez , I'm sore , and what's even better .... we're on the track today and I absolutely hate the track , but ya gotta do what you gotta do to improve , right ? :) 
lost 10 pounds . :DDD Exciting ! 
Needs more motivation . 
I love it how in 4 days I completely lost my playing ability on horn . Auditions are in 2 weeks .... * sigh * It really is a wake up call . So many things to work on , but not enough time . Life goes by SO fast . 
\Even the most beautiful roses have thorns . \"- < PROPFEMALE > Perea Luv ya BEST FRIEND !!!! " 
Mmmm . Rasberries . 
So far ... I've dropped 3 minutes off of my 5K time this summer , and I wanna drop 2 more before the cross country season starts . Then I'll be satisfied .... kinda . ;) 
Okay , well I guess i'll just focus on one goal until next week . Balancing 2 completely different ones is getting to be too much for me . 
Cross Country Race tomorrow morning . I am PUMPED ! :DDDD 
Wooowwww . The first cross country race I was actually energized for ... I slept through my alarm clock and missed the race . Man , that sucks . Well there's next week's race to look foward too . The Legends of cross country . Intense . 
Wants to travel the world . 
I love it how I've been drawing for 6 years and I still have trouble drawing an even circle . :P 
Goal : 25 < PROPFEMALE > 5K time this Saturday ! Piece . Of . Cake . 
Wants to dye her hair blaaaccckkkkkk . The color that I looove the mooost ! ;)

Sooo , uuhh , Now I'm starting think I shouldn't have given up trumpet in jazz ... I mean ... how many peices am I gonna be able to play for Jazz horn ? And I'm gonna be a JAZZ major .... I think I made a mistake .... :/// 
I've decided I'm doing 3 octave scales for my audition , and 4 octaves for the ones I can do . :PPP It's getting closer to that time ! 
To the Gym ! 
is happily practicing her horn for the next 5 hours . :) 
O.M.G. < PROPFIRST > Goncalves is phenomenal . His playing is like the most beautiful thing I have ever heard in my life . *_* 
AHHHH I LOOOVE VILLANELLE . THERE ARE NO WORDS TO DISCRIBE THIS SOOONNNGGGG . Well , I found my LVYO concerto competition piece . Now I just need to find the piano part to it . 
Most Americans ' car horns beep in the key of F . \ 
Most cows give more milk when they listen to music . \ 
Every time Beethoven sat down to write music , he poured ice water over his head . 
So I found out something productive I could do . When ever I can't sleep , get up and practice my horn regardless of what the time is . :) That could work considering the fact I have only had a total of 4 hours of sleep in 2 days . So many thoughts scramble through my mind at night ! >:/ 
25:21 ? I knocked off 2 minutes in one week ! I achieved my goal of wanting a 25min 5K time at a very important race to me . \Determination is the key . \"" 
Silverado Intramurals tomorrow ! I'm getting impatient ! :D 
They should make instruments that tune themselves . >:/ 
Just came back from a good workout today at the gym . :) 
Good Morning ! Oh how I have forgotten how much I love working out early in the morning ! Silverado Cross Country intramurals went well today ! Looking foward to a great competitive season ! 
Running + Music = Life 
Life gets you back in the strangest ways .... 
is addicted to the feeling of improvement and becoming a faster , better , and stronger human being . 
Mmmmm ... breakfeast after a fantastic workout ALWAYS puts me in a phenomenal mood . :) 
LVA Band auditions tomorrow ! Good Luck to ALL LVA BAND PEOPLE ! :) 
So many things I want to accomplish , but not enough time . I will MAKE time . ;) 
Well My audition didn't go as well as I wanted it to ; I screwed up on my 3 octave scales . :/ But there's always room for improvement , and I can't wait to get over that speed bump . Good luck to everyone today ! :) 
WOO ! A total of 5 < PROPMALE > for my run today . That cleared my mind of my disappointing audition . Now onto bigger and better things . Band camp tomorrow , then Xcountry practice right after . Life is oh SO GOOD . <3 
Band Camp was entertaining today ! Great Job everyone ! :) I hope everyone gets the results they want tomorrow after our concert ! <3 
As < PROPMALE > year rapidly approaches before me , I am beginning to feel like I have no time in my life anymore . These are my last 2 full years . :/ It's going by too fast . 
Well , I got 1st chair , but I am still happy to be sitting next to a phenomenal horn player like < PROPFEMALE > . I am very excited for our horn section this year . :) Great Job to everyone today ! 
I cannot wait until school starts . This is literally gonna be the best year of my life . :) ~ Class of 2012 ~ 
7 Hours of practicing is done . I picked out my jury for the first semester , and I actually plan on working on it the entire semester instead of BSing it in a week . Cross Country practice every morning . Jazz camp starting this Wednsday , & audition on saturday . Ugh , could this week be anymore busier ? It's a good way to end that summer , I guess . :) 
You know what makes me mad ? The fact that I am double majoring and I need to have music tech in this year cause I wont be able to fit it into next year's schedule . I signed up for Physics I H online , and I end up being the only one on the waiting list . Can't they just take me in NOW ? It's just ONE person ! >:/ 
Well , I can't sleep , and that only means one thing . Time to practice my French Horn ! A great way to start the new day at 12am ! 
Is going to workout ! See ya ! :D 
is working on Villanelle by < PROPFIRST > Dukas . My jury for 1st semster . <3 
Another 6 hours of practicing done ! I feel improvement . :) 
Okay , taking a day off from practicing today is bugging me . Just the thought of it . >:/ I'll probably just warm up or something . 
Cross Country Practice . <3 
JAZZ CAMP IN 2 DAYS ! :d

Is going to the Gym . 
I'm tirrreddd , but I still have cross country practice from 6:30 - 8:00 ... ugh ... but on the bright side ... JAZZZZZ CAMPPPP !!! Why am I so excited for it ? :D 
Okay , I am NOT ready for my Jazz audition . I dont know my < PROPFIRST > scales , my etudes sound mediocre , AND I haven't practice transposing the solo part . What's even better is the fact that IT'S TOMORROW ! D: 
Good Morning ! :D 
I swear I smelled nachos on my way to the gym yesterday .... it's tempting me .... 
I have officially fallen in love with Jazz , but transposing the trombone part and taking it an octave up was a little challenging , but I have a whole year to improve on it . ;) 
Hey , guess what ? I FIGURED OUT MY < PROPFIRST > SCALES ! HA ! I feel accomplished . 
YESSSS , JAZZ HORN ! 
Jazz III , V3 Band , AND < PROPMALE > harmonic Orchestra , Music Tech .... and only 2 academic classes during school . LVYO < PROPMALE > After school plus Cross Country . This year is gonna rock . 
I seriously can't wait until school starts . This last week of summer needs to hurry UP ! >:/ 
When I was little , I used to spend hours on my dad's drumset just banging and apparently trying to figure stuff out on it . :P Interesting ... 
I dyed my hair dark brown yesterday , and suprisingly it looks good on me . I thought it was gonna look like I was some super depressed kid . :P 
Time to work off the weekend , at the gym . :/ 
So tell me , Theater Majors , are we seriously performing Hairspray for our musical this year ?!!?!?! 
Can't wait for LVYO , or school , or this year's musical , or Jazz , or the composition competition . ;) SO MUCH TO LOOK FOWARD TOO ! :D 
OMG . Finale 2011 is out ! I WANT IT ! :( 
I am so unbelievably BORED . >:/ 
YESSSS , I can compose again ! I just downloaded finale notepad 2011 !!! Composition competition here I come ! 
Woooowww .... I was in the key of Bb and I started my 3 chord on an E . I'm stupid . >:/ Now I have to go ALL the way back and fix it . 
Why am I still awake ? Good Night .

Is going for a run . 6 < PROPMALE > today ! See ya ! 
DANNNG . My piece is coming along quite well , of course there's still a few parts I need to fix .... wheres the staff paper when you need it ? :) 
I wanna too make another song ... I think I will . 
Okay , I'm practicing my horn at 11 o'clock at night , I really don't wanna wake my parents or my little brother .... I gotta get one of those silent brass mutes . :/ Oh well whatever , I'm doing what I love , they can't argue with that . :P 
Good Night ! 
Getting my schedule fixed to day ! I'm excited ! :D

I need to get a Stop mute , and a Silent Brass mute . :P Oh , and some Staff paper , so I can compose ...... oh yeahh and Finale 2011 . So much to get ! <3 hahha

Staff , paper ... I NEED IT . I'm additcted to composing . 
I can officially say , I can hit a concert Ab above the staff on horn after losing my range for 3 weeks during the summer . I'm glad I got it back . :/ 
Is anyone taking a class online !??! :( 
I OFFICIALLY HATE TECHNOLOGY . >:/ 
Physics I H online is A NIGHTMARE ! 0_0 
O.M.G. Mr. < PROPMALE > is like in LOVE with the LVYO orchestra this year ... especially the horn section . ;) 
Whoa , I can feel myself gradually improving on horn . This year has ALREADY proven to be great . 
\BUM BUM PE TE ! \ " is my baby brother's way of saying Sponge < PROPMALE > Square Pants . " 
Okay , My normal school day of playing officially starts at 8:30 am with Jazz(1hr 30m ) , then practicing for an hour at Lunch , then Band(1hr 30m ) , Phil(1hr 30m ) ending at 2:00 pm , and LVYO-phil afterschool(2hr 30m ) . Insane .... in between that , I would practice my horn at home . :O 
Brahms is a genius . 
Is talking to her BEST FRIEND . I LOVE YOU < PROPFEMALE > Perea !!!! Don't DITCH LVYO AGAIN ! ;) 
Is Bored .... and in the mood for some Hawaiian Candies . 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOUsbtUrXHk&feature=player_embedded 
OHHHH That IS IT ! You are GOING DOWN ! >:/ 
WOOOO ! We opened the \gates \"/ garage door/wall while it was raining during Jazz today . I love the smell of rain and I'm obsessed with Jazz . Today was just the best day of my life . ;) haha " 
< PROPFIRST > Trionfo , you are going to be a world class musician one day . Have fun at interlochen and keep me updated ! Love you ! 
I found my twin you guys ! It's Aija Mattson ... finally ! We have been reunited ! lololol jk ! ;) One day we are going to play in the same section together , Aija ! 
He's gonna eat his words . That's not gonna happen this year . 
I feel good . I didn't do that well in jazz today .... band was fine ... phil was totally worth the long , sustained notes in < PROPFEMALE > Burana , and LVYO was EPIC . I managed to finish the majority of my homework at < PROPFIRST>'s House AND had a GREAT time with < PROPFEMALE > Diaz and < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Cline . I absolutely LOVE thursdays . 
Okay , I'm practicing my jazz music .... I failed miserably at it during the assembly . :P I feel baadd nooow . :/ 
Vote for Chy Miller , as Band Council President ! 
I think I'm obsessed with this brass , spiral-shaped thing that makes sound . 
Vote for Chy Miller , as Band Council Vice President ! :) 
I just finished watching the New York < PROPMALE > Brass quintet on youtube . It blew my mind . 
Is finally taking a day off from practicing ... I think I over-did it this week . 
OMG ! I might see he LV < PROPMALE > tonight ! :) 
OMGOMGOMGOMGOMG !!! 2 hours until The LV < PROPMALE > CONCERT !!! :DDD 
< PROPFEMALE > Burana , anyone ? 
The Las Vegas Philharmonic was PHENOMENAL tonight ! I REALLY enjoyed it ... it was the first one I have ever been to , and it was somewhat of an eye-opener of what is yet to come . ;) 
.... Smart music is being annoying right now . I don't understand why we have to send our audition through smart music for the Honor Band/Orch of < PROPFEMALE > . :/ 
Soooo I just got obsessive , and recorded my Eb scale 130 times to make it \perfect\ " to send it in with my other audition stuff ... I can't believe I just did that . o.O " 
I just BURNED my bacon ... fantastic ... 
I'm tired , and stressed about this stupid HBOA audition .... good night ! 
I can't sleep .... time to practice my horn ... 
I want some colombian food right now .... 
Why can't people just be honest to me . I don't like the white lie crap , or encouragement .. I'm not 5 years old .... I get my motivation from brutal honesty . PLEASE . 
Oh no ... time for smart music .... just 2 more excerpts .... ugh . 
I'm SOOO tired , but I can't seem to get satisfied with my audition recording ... I've already recorded it 54 times . :/// 
YES ! I finished ALL of my audition stuff ! Wish me Luck ! :D 
I love my < PROPMALE > year so far . :) Best year od my life . <3 I wonder what else is in store for the next few months ... oh I forgot to mention ... I'm obsessed with the french horn ... I don't know if you guys knew that ... ;))) 
This is getting out of hand . I haven't had a good playing day since the 2nd day of school . Mr. Jackson(LVYO ) told me to put ice on it , and it helped a little , but recently I have been having trouble playing anything over a G just above the staff . That's depressing ... My flexibility is shot too . :( I try to take a day off and it still doesn't help ... neither does warming up for a long time ! Any suggestions horn players ? :/ 
is over-practicing .... again .... :/ 
I have to fix my Embouchure pressure problem before I get to college .... better start now . :/ The swelling is getting the best of me at this moment in time . 
Okay , english HW and math HW AND physics homework to do ... I had like no time to do it yesterday ... ugh ... now I gotta do it ALL todayy .... :( 
UGHH Stupid physics HW !!! >://// 
is procrastinating AGAIN . :) I'm gonna regret this . 
. Jazz . 
Soooo , I think I did pretty well on my ear training test in jazz today ... better than last time that's for sure . hahaha 
BAHAHA I love being together with < PROPFEMALE > Diaz at LVYO . We're so hilarious when we're tired ! HAHAHAHAHA 
So , I got 3 chances to hit a pinata today during lunch in the jazz room .... the first time I hit it ... 2nd time I swung harder , but apparently almost hit Mr. Bowen ...? hahaha and the 3rd time I missed . Today was great ... hahaha 
Australian Exchange Band today ! :DDD I love this stuff ! I hope an australian band comes again next year too ! :) Good luck everyone ! <3 
Wow .... I've changed alot this year compared to my personality from last year ..... I'm in deep thought . :) 
One of these days , my dream is going to become reality ..... 
I need to start using less pressure ... seriously ..... its really bugging me now ... ugh . :/ 
Why is < PROPFEMALE > Vista such a great marching band ? O.o 
. Peace . Love . Music . 
.... I hope the bills won .... D : But by the looks of it .... THEY SUCK . >:/// 
UGHHH NOOOOO !!!! I have to babysit my vicious brother tonight ! NOOOOOO ! > : 0 He's a terrible 2 year old ! 
Crap . I have to memorize my Jazz Standards .... 
Ran 12 < PROPMALE > in the heat , and is extremely sore with a bad sunburn . D: This is what I get for loving a sport that not everyone enjoys doing , and that keeps me healthy ...? 
I think people need to shrink . I couldn't see our conductor in < PROPMALE > today because like 3 peoples heads were in the way ! I had to STAND and play in order to see him . It felt awkward .... at first ... then I started to finally enjoy it ... Downey was making fun of my shortness . I'm probably gonna be using a phone book for the open house concert . BAHAHA 
Math , Physics , and English HW ... THEN to memorize 5 Jazz standards .... finally ... to write crap on my practice card for band .... Those practice records are SO STUPID ! >:/ 
I STILL have to read the Crucible and do part of the study guide ... as well as run 6 miles .... ughhhh ... how in the WORLD am I gonna get time to memorize JAZZ STANDARDS .... I DON'T NEED THEM .... at the moment at least ... ://// 
WOOOW ... I just got a new horn case like 2 years ago ... and I already need a new one . Fantastic . :PPP Time for a nice cloth one ... not those hard ones that look like a middle school kid is playin it . ;) 
SO MUCH TO DO , SO LITTLE TIME ! D: 
Red Machine = MY FAVORITE SONG EVAAAA ! <333 That composer was a genius ! 
Is slowly getting her high range back , but needs to start working on using less pressure again . 
Feels like practicing for 12 hours today ... 
Villanelle ~ Paul Dukas\ 
Best song EVAAA !! 
I miss cross country ... :( LVA stuff is always in the way ! D: 
Ew ... I just listened to a recording of Red Machine today in band .... I sound gross on my solos . D: 
Frostfire .... how beautiful . *___* < PROPMALE > Quan and Juanpablo Macias .... I think we have found our music ! INTENSE ! 
WOO Showdown @ Silverado ! TOMORROWWWW !!!! Exciting ! 
Silverado showdown is TODAY ! I can't wait !!! Silverado is doing pretty well this year for marching band ! 
Foothill BLEW ME AWAY during silverado showdown ... they took first like they deserved ... I was disappointed with green valley .... coronado was amazing as always .... PALO VERDE HAD SUCH GREAT VISUALS in their show , < PROPFEMALE > had good visuals as well .... and last but not least , silverado , the host , did a phenomenal job at their performance . :) Great Job everyone ! 
UGHHH ! My little brother just banged his head into my mouth ... now my lips are swollen ! The one time I don't block my mouth whe I'm around him ! He needs to get out of this \Terrible Two\ " stage NOW ! >:/ " 
Sooo if anyone could possible find the recording of Artemis by < PROPFIRST > Rouse ( Brass Quintet ) , that would be FANTASTIC ! I NEEEDDDD it . 
What if I could teleport ? That would make like so much easier . 
You know what's weird ? I enjoy transposing . It makes me feel intelligent . lmao 
is scared . D: HALLOWEEN ! ;) My Baby brother is a pirate for Halloween this year . :D 
SOOO I've decided that I'm gonna be a monk playing my french horn for halloween ...? * sigh * I don't wanna take my brother trick or treating . :PPP 
< PROPFEMALE > Brown is one of the most influential people I have EVERRR met . <333 
Daydreaming ..... 
Mmmm A nice run to end a good day . LVYO < PROPMALE > tomorrow .... how exciting . Tomorrow is also and Odd dayyy !!! ;) I love my odd days . ;) 
The month of november is loaded with so many rehersals and performances .... as well as December . Life is good . :) 
.... sooo is there such thing as a national french horn day ...? 
Yay ! 5K race tomorrow ! I can't wait !! I'm attempting to get into shape again ... maybe I can do track season this year .... ;) 
..... Ewald was a genius writing music for brass quintets . :) I hope I can another one for LVYWO this year . ;) Set it up < PROPFIRST > Wylie !!! <3 
Alright , like this and I'll admit .... 
* sigh * My pressure problem was getting better , then I stopped practicing for like 4 days last weekend and lost like all of my endurance and flexibillity , so now this whole 3 days has just been a matter of getting back to where I used to be ... I got back into the annoying habit again . D: 
Well , apparently I'm out of shape , but my 5k time is still LOW ! YEAH ! 25:16 ! Now I can get back into shape and be even more beastly ! Las Vegas Half marathon here I come ! :))) 
Mahler 5 Mvt . 2 is fantastic !!! <33 
Wooow .... the las vegas track club typed up the wrong time for my results .... thats the 2nd time . They switched 2 < PROPFIRST > around ..... Whatever ... >:/ 
I think I want to start competing in triathlons .... 
Why is te honor band audition music so tedious this year !? >:/ The techinical etude so loooong and my face gets dead fast . D: 
Ew .... I got 2nd place in the 10K today . D: Time to go train up in Redrock ! :D 
So many things to see , to touch , to taste , to hear , to smell .... why can't I have it all NOW ?!?! :) 
Eventually , right ? Eventually . 
Time to go to school ..... D : 
You can take anything away from me and I'll be fine .... just don't take my Horn or you're never gonna see the light of day . 
A good night of practicing- Now for Physics homework . Then SLEEP !!! I wish humans didn't have to sleep . I need more time to do things in my day .... don't you think the human race would be far more productive and successful if we didn't have to sleep ?

< PROPMALE > Quan We got the brass quintet gig ! :D What time of the day would you be comfortable playing ?... I wanna play all day ... hahaha but in the morning would be good for me ... well actually anytime of the day is fine . So just let me know pronto ! :) 
You know .... I sometimes I wish I had an older brother .... * sigh * A little brother is too much to handle ... but I love him . :) 
sooo the power went off last night , and shut off my alarm clock , making me miss my 10K race .... I guess that's life telling me not to run a 6 mile race when I haven't ran for 6 days . 
Okay , so , I wanna make an exotic dessert/cookie for thanksgiving this year ..... perferably something from another country that most people don't make here . Any ideas ? 
Is gonna go see HP 7 today ! ;) Slytherin all the way . haha 
So ... I went to go and get my bike to ride it to the movie theater ( HP7 ) .... and I go to find that it wasn't where I locked it up . Someone stole it . Ohhh I hate people . I ended up walking to the movie theater . >:/ But on the bright side .... HP7 was GREAT ! :D 
Time to get to work ..... 
Apparently my Brass quintet is playing for a giniger bread competition up in boulder city . Theis should be fun ! :)

You know what bothers me .... food . It's just there to make you fat and unhealthy . ;) ahahaha but its SO GOOD . 
So I tried seeing if I was left brained or right brained with that little dancer shadow that spins , and I got right brained which means that I am ARTISTIC . :) 
I'm exhausted .... physics essay due tomorrow .... ugh . :/ 
Nothing a good , sugary cup of coffee can't fix . ;) 
* sigh * Stress free at last . Time to do my math hw ahead of time ! ohh I feel SO productive at the moment . ;) haha I cant believe I'm excited to finish hw . <.< what's WRONG with me !?!? O.o 
Well now that the band concert is done over with ... IT'S TIME FOR JAZZ ! ON FRIDAY ! :) 
Doesn't wanna grow up yet . D: 
You know ... I didn't really think about how time consuming Jazz , Band , < PROPMALE > , and lvyo-phil , and lvyo-symphony would be until I came across a little month called December .... this month is crazy right now . O.o 
When I was little , my favorite show was the Power Rangers . ;) 
Being a freshman , starting new again with the knowledge I have , would make life soooo much easier right now . :/ 
Jazz concert today ! :D 7pm in the LOWDEN !!! GO GO GO !! ;) 
I had a great concert today ! WOOO I LOVE JAZZ ! 
Why does chaos exist ? Why is there never true peace ? Why can't time stand still on command ? It seems as though nothing gives me an answer to everything because in reality , there is no answer . 
Great Job to all the members of the LVYOs !!! Our concerts were phenomenal and our hard work showed ! ;) Ohhh I LOVE LVYO !! <3 
I achieved something , finally , that I've been waiting for , for like EVER . I only missed 2 notes in a total of 6 songs we played for our las vegas youth orchestra concert ... and YES I have no life cause I constantly keep track of my mistakes . ;) 
Well , I finally found someone who's tone is similar to mine . < PROPMALE > Dohr . I'm going to start modeling my playing around him ~ 
I am OBSESSING over < PROPMALE > Dohr's tone ! * Drool * I want to see him perform live ! \

Good luck to everyone at the Honor Band Auditions !!! :) 
SOOOO apparently I had a bad honor band audition ... D : 
I'll redeem myself for all-state auditions . 
SOOO you know what makes me feel worse about my playing ? Listening to a 15 year old kid perform a complicated solo sounding 10 times better than I could ever make it sound at this point in time . Wow . I suck .... I wonder when he started playing horn ... prolly one of those kids that started when they were like 7 or something ... ugh . 
Secret < PROPFEMALE > in the LVA Horn section . <.< >.>

Ate a BUNCH of crap today , and its TOO cold to go work it off . D: Now I'm just drowning myself in jazz music . ;) 
You know ... I could care less about money ; all I need is my Horn and the clothes on my back . The simplicity would bring great peace to my life . :) 
Can't find my glasses . I can't see ANYTHING . What am I gonna do ? :/ 
I wish Horn was meant to be a jazz instrument . 
Is practicing . :) 
They should create a < PROPFEMALE > Clause horror movie .... then the parents should show it to the kids when its time for them to find out that < PROPFEMALE>'s NOT REAL ! ;) 
I feel like doing an all day practice session today .... 
I am SOOO bad at wrapping presents . -.- 
Music . Is . My . Life . Period . ;) 
Have you ever wondered what it'd be like to hear absolutely nothing when you're floating around in space .....? 
Should've ran under the solar eclipse early this morning . That would've been a night to remember . ;)

Would you rather have 500 tarantulas crawling in your house or 1000 crickets jumping around your room ? 
So I added in something to my practice session today ... I played a little holiday music for my baby brother . :) 
Would you rather be < PROPMALE > and ugly , or Poor and good looking ? 
Addicted to The Hunger Games by < PROPFEMALE > Collins . 
Hunger Games !

Wants to be an author AND a musician .... how am I gonna work that out ? 
Is writing a story AND doing homework at the SAME EXACT TIME . :O 
HMMM WELL , I downloaded this 3D modeler thing in an attempt to create my character I was gonna write about in my story , but I didnt realize how compicated it actually was . It's really confusing . O.o 
Well my 2 year old brother doesnt know that shape of a heart is called a heart .... SO he was playing with his play-do and he comes to me with it and asks , \ Can you make love ? \ " Apparently thats his way of asking \ " Can you make me a heart ? \ " . HAHAHAHAHAHAHA " 
Crap . I haven't been able to practice for the past 2 days .... I picked up my horn today and played ... guess what I sounded like ? A 3 year old trying to play the horn for the first time . This sucks . 
Whoa . I feel grrreaaat ! Got homework done , read the hunger games , ran , and practiced my horn . LIfe is good . aaaahhhhh ~ 
Dear Nathanieal Hawthorne , \

Sincerely , \ 
< PROPFIRST > 
Now I wish break was longer because I wanna just dive and submerge myself in my imagination . That's all I want right now ... Why couldn't it be real ? ;) 
Hmmm ... adventures of < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > during LVYO . I swear .... those have been the FUNNIEST times of my life . 
The deed is done ... I dyed my hair black . :) 
I've come to the conclusion that this year will be the year of accomplishment . :) 
Practicing my horn . :) OH and ALL LVA KIDS ! PRACTICE YOUR HONOR BAND MUSIC . I DON'T CARE HOW EASY IT IS ! JUST DO IT ! ;) 
Okay , so I just checked parentlink for the grade I got for the recording in jazz ... and there are STILL no grades listed . D: WTH ?!?! How come I'm the only person who hasn't had ANY of their grades uploaded !??! It's cause I'm a horn player ... I swear . Thanks ALOT Mr. bowen ! 
I kinda regret dying my hair black ... I miss my brown hair . :( Oh well nothing I can do now ... I don't feel like bleaching it then dying it brown again ... that's too much of hassle ... I'll just let it grow out ... ugh thats gonna take forever . O.o 
Is stressed and disappointed . Is EVERYTHING I EVER talk about , music ? Nothing else comes across my path . <.< I'm tired , I'm high on practicing , no kidding , I don't wanna stop , and I'm not gonna for another 5 hours .... Is that a bad thing ? D: 
Who knew astrology could predict that ... O.o wooowww .... 
As strange as it sounds , I wish LVYO was everyday . 
Going for a run , THEN I'm gonna continue writing my story ! :) 
WHAT !??! No way in HELL am I getting sick ! I was like one of those people at school who could be around contagious people and NEVER catch anything . Ugh ... here we go ... I really hope this doesn't bum out my mood if it stays with me for honor band . :P whatever .... 
I DON'T have a blank CD and I need to record my audition TONIGHT ! D: WHAT AM I GONNA DOOOO !??!?!? 
\I'm off my game . \"" 
Okay , Cinna was one of my favorite characters .... now he's gone . Books are great . ;) 
Recording auditions is SUCH a pain .... oh what I do for my instrument ... O.o 
So , my top 3 college choices are all in boston .... I didn't mean to plan it like that . O.o 
Humor is richly rewarding to the person who employs it . It has some value in gaining and holding attention . But it has no persuasive value at all . \
