How long should one lie at home with headache , dizziness and nausea , so they cannot eat substantially ? At what point do these symptoms merit a visit to a doctor in the absence of fever ? I wasn't too concerned but now I am heading into night four . Just seems this should be over , especially the nausea part . 
It's my gall bladder . For details , please see my last comment on my last post . It hasn't gone critical or anything . I hope everyone's doing well tonight . Hugs ! 
Happy Spring Equinox !
