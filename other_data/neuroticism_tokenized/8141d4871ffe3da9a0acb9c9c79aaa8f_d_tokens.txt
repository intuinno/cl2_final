Wonders why life has to be so complicated . 
It's been said that everlasting friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question the friendship . These types of friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been or how far away they live , and they don't hold grudges . They understand that life is busy , but you will ALWAYS love them . Re-post if you have at least 1 of these friends . They will know who they are .
