baby update : starting to dilate now , so about a week if that so says my dr. everythings going good , just hope I get everything done in time lol procrastination is such a horrible habit .! 
sometimes the mountain youve been climbing is just a grain of sand , and what youve been out there searching for forever , is in your hand , and when you figure out love is all that matters after all , it sure makes everything else seem so small ... ( Carrie Underwood ) I think that pretty much says it all , we take life for granted , when everyday is truly a miracle we need to be thankful were blessed to have . Happy Easter 
A piece of me is now in heaven , we lost our angel on earth , but they gained a beautiful baby there . She touched so many lives while she was here , including saving ours . She will be missed beyond words . A piece of both of our hearts is now gone , and I'm still trusting in God to get us through this , please keep praying for my family . 
Thank you to everyone who came to the service today , everyone was appreciated and we want to thank everyone for everything they did and please keep praying for us .

I don't need an angel on my Christmas tree . I already have one in heaven looking down on me ........ put this as your status if there is someone in heaven you will miss this christmas .... 
If you know someone who has lost a child , and you're afraid to mention \ 
them because you think you might make them sad by reminding them that \ 
they died--you're not reminding them . They didn't forget they died . What\ 
you're reminding them of is that you remembered that they lived , and \ 
... that is a great gift . ~ < PROPFEMALE > Edwards .... Thanks Joy I love this ! 
Excited ... spending the day with my bestie :) 
I do not get into the political opinions and other things on here , but this is just straight up wrong and I dont care who it is that died I dont care if its the devil himself ya know what ? God handles these things and we dont need to ... Westboro is insane and need to be stopped somehow ... Its just wrong , and it is no ones place to punish anyone , for any reason . 
ok peoples ... I need a good covered dish recipe ... I know you got em ... :) 
blackberry merlot is oh so tasty ... 
Ok , so Im watching < PROPFIRST > St. Cloud tonight ... tissues will be handy ... 
Most people have 1000 wishes for Christmas ; a cancer patient only has one , to get better . I know 97% of you won't repost this to your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do . In honor of someone who has died , or is still fighting , or survived cancer , copy this to your status .?

Preppy Girls come from New York , Sweet Girls come from Texas , Prissy Girls come from California . But we North < PROPFEMALE > girls have Fire and Ice in our Blood ! We can ride four wheelers , drive trucks , Be a < PROPFEMALE > , Throw left Hooks , Pack heat , Fish with the Boys , Bake a cake , love with passion , AND IF WE HAVE AN OPINION ...... YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR IT . Repost if you are proud to be a North < PROPFEMALE > girl ! 
at 9:33 am 3 years ago today my baby boy was born !! Happy Birthday < PROPFIRST > Bear !! 
This week we remember all babies born sleeping or whom we have carried but never met , or those we have held but could not take home or the ones that came home but didn't stay . Make this your profile status if you or someone you know has suffered the loss of a baby . The majority won't do it , because unlike cancer , baby loss is still a taboo subject . Break the silence . In memory of all our precious angels . 
I refuse to be a gemini ... I have been a crab for 24 years ... this is stupid ... not that it matters anyways ... bunch of nonsense 
ok so , not sure of what all my friends were notified of ... I wouldnt give my husband the remote and apparently he took it out on my profile by hacking into it ... lol never a dull moment 
Lost a friend today ... sucks but I am commited to being drama free in 2011 
I am still determined to be cheerful and happy , in whatever situation I may be ; for I have also learned from experience that the greater part of our happiness or misery depends upon our dispositions , and not upon our circumstances . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > Washington 
Facebook doesnt hurt people , people with facebook hurt people . I have been on both sides , but there is no one to blame but ourselves . 
Thankful for my husband , love him more all the time and in the words of < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > \this aint nothin\ " Thankful for my best friend who I would be lost without and for old friends who make me smile when Im down and for new ones who make me laugh hysterically with their great stories lol ... all in all this has been an enlightening and tough weekend but happy to say I got all need right here with me :) "

If your Dad was a hard working man and was your hero , helped you no matter how bad you were or was just the BEST DAD EVER , if you are blessed to still have your DAD or if he is an angel in Heaven , paste this to your status and let everyone know you are PROUD of your Dad . You can replace a lot of people , but you only have one DAD . I'm very very proud of mine ... I LOVE MY DADDY

Good old North < PROPFEMALE > . Where the tea is sweet and accents are sweeter . Summer starts in April ( we hope ) , front porches are wide and words are long . Macaroni and cheese is a vegetable , Y'All is a proper pronoun . Chicken is fried and biscuits come with gravy . Everyone is < PROPFEMALE > and someone is always getting their Hearts Blessed . Repost if you are proud to be from North < PROPFEMALE > 
A good mom thinks about her children day & night , even when they're grown . A good mom loves her children in a way they'll never understand . A good mom will be there for her children when no one else will . A good mom would take a bullet , stand in front of a train , & ask God to take her instead of her child . If you have a child that you love this much , post this as your status ... To BOTH my children .. I Love You
