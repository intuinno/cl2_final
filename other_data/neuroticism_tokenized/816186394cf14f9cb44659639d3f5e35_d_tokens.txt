Aahhh ..... Peyton started 7th grade today ........ he's now an official \middleschooler . \ " It's really kind of sad ...... i was helping him remember his lunch number plus his TWO locker combinations ! He asked me this morning \ " Mom what do I do when I get there ! \ " :( " 
What a day ...... at least i stood my ground ! Gotta stand for something or you'll fall for everything ........ 
So sick of people in general and how they always seem to disappoint :( Tis the season for it i guess ....... maybe people think the same of me as well . 
Feels so good ........ a weight off my shoulders . Don't why I didn't do this sooner ....... ridding my life of the garbage . Literally and figuratively !
