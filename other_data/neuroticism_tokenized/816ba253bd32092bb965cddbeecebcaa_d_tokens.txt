My early birthday celebration ( along with < PROPMALE>'s , but he doesn't matter ) could either be considered the worst day , and most ridiculous one , or the most amazing , depending on you you slice it . 
One < PROPFEMALE > ball of yarn and one < PROPMALE > = $33 . The things I do for love . Anyone build model airplanes ?

If you get hit in the head with a big ol ' rock , no matter how uberly strong you are , you are going to be severely injured . Why doesn't manga follow this logic ?! 
Last minute change of plans led me to watching Inception instead of Step Up 3D ( not that I'm complaining ) . It's the most COMPLICATED MOVIE EVARR !! Pay close attention folks . 
I got it ! Mr. K looks like a smaller version of < PROPFIRST > McGee ! 
PEOPLE ! It's tax free day/ weekend !!! Go out and buy < PROPFEMALE > junk ! Such as TVS !!! 
Hey people ! Talcum powder can cause cancer ! ... If you inhale it for 6 hours everyday for 113 weeks that is ... ( At least , that's what the rats did )

MY LOLLIPOPS CAME !!! Admittedly , so far , they just taste like regular lollipops , except more sour ( Bugger ) , but I've only had strawberry so far ! It's not the end yet ! 
< PROPFIRST > Pilgrim vs . The World is possibly one of the most amazing movies ever , and not just because I have an obsession with < PROPFIRST > Cera .

WOOT ! I finished my last Summer reading paper at 4 30 in the morning ! I'll admit I'm only half way through the book and the paper was completely half assed , but I'm DONE ! 
Pet obsession goes a long way when you go out to buy stuff and you leave the airconditioner on for your dogs ... 
When someone says they'll give you all the money in their wallet , you expect at least a couple 20's , NOT 6 dollars !!! 
\So what 
Sick Sick Sick . What a great way to end the Summer ... I think I'm DYING ! 
QUICK ! MEMBERS OF MY IMMEDIATE UNIVERSE ! WHAT'S THE SPANISH HOMEWORK ??? 
Just downed 5 pills all at once at the insistence of my cantankerous mom . Starting to feel a little queasy . Is that bad ? 
What happens if you like your own status ? 
My mom convinced me to put massage ointment on my mosquito bite . Two words : IT BURNS !

FOLKS OF MY ALMOST-IMMEDIATE UNIVERSE ! WHY IS RANK SO IMPORTANT IN CONFUCIANISM ??? 
My brother's nighttime/pain reliever pills just expired . 500 mg of acetaminophen(pain reliever ) and 25mg of diphenhydramine(sleep aid ) . And it says take 2 . Have you ever thought of how much is in your medicine ? o.O 
That book fest game was totally rigged . =P 
I had a mug that was black inside , so when i grabbed one of those < PROPFEMALE > spoons , i couldn't really see the inside and so i kept scooping in like 3-4 < PROPFEMALE > -spoonfuls of < PROPFEMALE > tea and it was BITTER ! Bugger . 
Children in the dark make accidents . Accidents in the dark make children ... o.O 
So my family is uber religious , and when a girl hits puberty she is supposed to cross this sacred bridge for protection from ... something . I don't know . Anyway , since I couldn't be there they walked across the bridge with some clothes that they bought and sent them to me to wear . Heh heh heh ... Three letters : O . M . G . 
\Chelsey be eyein ' this with pleasure . \ " LAWL ! " 
The smell of these bridge clothes is KILLING M-*Dies . *

Just spun my first batch of yarn today and it might possibly be the CRAPPIEST yarn that will ever be made into something ( yes , even if it sucks , it WILL be something cool ! ) . 
Drinking coffee gives me a headache which makes me tired . Is that ironic or what ? 
I've come to understand why old people loathe \Christmas Knitting . \"" 
I just saw The Social Network ! And you know what ? It's like knowing where your food comes from . Mildly depressing ... 
Interesting new development : Our brains do NOT actually multitask ! We switch from one task to the other , so we're actually only doing ONE at a time ! Weird , huh ? 
Just came back from a 12:30 showing of \It's Kind of a Funny Story\ " and the movie is NOTHING like how they are marketing it . Don't watch the trailer folks . This is just more of life confirming what I already know : TRAILERS LIE ! I'm tired ... " 
Mom and < PROPFEMALE > are out spending < PROPMALE > Day together ! And I have a strong urge to buy things ... 
My dog ( the one I'm not the biggest fan of ) is weird . When she pees , not only does she squat down , she also lifts one leg . 
One shot of vanilla extract with 35% alcohol ( 1.5 oz ) is the equivalent of 12oz of beer or 5oz of wine ! However , it goes bye bye once you bake it into something . Whoever thought of getting drunk off of that stuff ? 
I'm getting me a hobo cookie ! Yeahhhh . 
Hey folks , what is the homework ? 
So I took a look at a < PROPFEMALE > phone number and it has sixteen digits ! Also , it starts with 0 ! 
While cleaning a butter knife I sliced off a chunk of my thumb ( seriously ?! Who would make such a sharp butter knife ?! ) . And YES , it does hurt as much as you think it does . 
Braces ! Except I have TOO MUCH TEETH and I have to get TWO TEETH TAKEN OUT !!! Argh !!! 
AHH ! I HAD THE BRACKETS FOR BRACES PUT ON TODAY AND WHILE FLOSSING I JUST FIGURED OUT THAT 2 TEETH ARE SEALED TOGETHER !!! WHAT IS THAT ?! 
The < PROPFEMALE > looks like a slice o ' cheese today ! If you sliced it with a cookie cutter , that is ! 
Clement : They don't have a brown ! That makes me so sad . Oh , I think yellow would be close . \\ 
Have you ever thought about what the people we see and interact with do OUTSIDE of school ? Like , teachers and fellow classmates ? I contemplated this very deeply while i was brushing my teeth with no pants on . 
This creative project is sucking the life out of me !!! 
I'm done with the creative project ! Woohoo ! Now on to BIOLOGY ! 
A pokemon master in a game over 10 years old ? Omg I'm such a nerddd . =P 
I didn't know that curry was so spicy to normal folks ... 
I am now two teeth less of a person than I once was and you know what ? I feel ... Crappy . 
I'm hungry and noodles is a total fail . What does one eat after they get teeth taken out ?! 
Math team bake sale on KYSN ! ( I think . ) Anyway , so considering my habit of burning things , Mrs. Hammond suggests I do a lot of practicing ! This means that a bunch of you are going to gain like 5 pounds this week . Also , any suggestions on what to make ? 
Pumpkin pie : With or without crust ? 
I totally made cake ! Except I bsed it and it's flat and somewhere between sponge and custard or something . And Kind of hard , but edible ! 
I've officially decided that that today is Do-Nothing Day . Even though I have a whole bunch of homework and an upcoming test , it all comes second to do nothing day =P . 
I've just hit an all time low . I burnt something that didn't require baking ! And then drank like 3 week old coffee that was chunky and tasted sour ... 
Tempted to bake crushed cough drops into my cookies . If I feed that to someone , is that considered drugging them ? Ahh , not like it'll do anything anyway . 
< PROPFEMALE > has decided that my peppermint cookies are way too many things , minty , sweet , salty , buttery , cookie , biscuit , and even more . Therefore , my bookies are now going to be called The Indecisive Cookie , or Tic for short . 
Tomorrow is the Math Team Bake Sale at Know Your School Night ! I'm not one to force people into doin ' stuff they don't want to do , but if you love me buy my pie !! 
Attention fellow 9th graders ! What should I bake you guys tomorrow ? 
You people bought my pie !!! Awesome !!! 
Spend the day baking with < PROPFEMALE > ! Now the place is a mess and I'm out of sugar and nearly out of flour , salt , baking soda and butter ! Woohoo ! Who wants pie ? 
\I'm not unfaithful but I'll stray . \"" 
The whole house smells like cinnamon but I didn't make anything ! 
Anyone know a good pizza place that delivers ? I'm feeling spaghetti . =D 
I've got spaghetti ! With mushrooms and onions and something else ! And it only took an HOUR ! 
I need butter ... 
Wooot !!! I got me a hobo cookie ! Three , in fact ! 
Clem : Yo let's go get butter at Savers . \ 
Me : Uhhh , why is the food seperated by gender ? 
Red things make me feel DRAMATIC ! 
Quick poll : Who will wear a sweatshirt inside their house ? 
When I'm upset , I console myself by eating . When I start feeling better , I reward myself by eating . And now I have no food . 
Do you ever get really hungry , eat something really fast , and then get sad that it's gone ? 
As we stood around the long metal table , listening to the matriarch recount tales of gruesome deaths brought on by simple mistakes , there was a silence , and we all slowly turned our heads toward the kitchen , and deeply contemplated death by frialator . 
Woo hoo ! We came in first place ( tied with some other school) ! Yay , go Math Team ! 
Fellow pubescent 9th graders ! Are any of you guys eating food by the truckloads or is it just me ? 
Did anyone else know that \cacao\ " is apparently pronounced \ " coh-coh ?! \"" 
While pouring out like 3 week old coffee , he noticed it still looked fine and called it \The McDonald's Factor . \"" 
Clem : I want my kids to address me as Bob . \ 
Me : Really ?! \ 
C : Of course not ! I secretly want to be addressed as < PROPFIRST > , but if they don't get that , then they get no food for the night . \ 
M : WTH ? 
Omg I have nothing to say ... 
It smells like food in here but no one made any . o.O 
I ordered a package on Saturday and it just came today ! Woah ! Fastest package I've ever recieved ! 
So I just found out that putting brownies in the fridge is NOT a good idea ... 
I was out of hand soap so I washed my hands with toothpaste . Is that bad ? 
I think it's the time of the year when we should all fear BOTULISM ! 
I wish for snow oh universe ! 
Devising ways to get around getting out of bed ... 
Does the mailman work on Christmas ? 
Clement : So I was thinking . What if someone were a chronic paraplegic and their legs gave out while they were on the toilet . \ 
Me : Then they wouldn't get up . 
\Happy Holidays ... \ 
It's kind of a bummer when it doesn't snow on Christmas . 
Some song about a Winter Wonderland ! 
So how high is the snow anyway ? 
Goodbye 2010 ! You were a pretty good year , but I admit that I probably wont miss you all that much . =) 
I wonder what parallel universe me(s ) are doing right now ... 
\I can't wait till I'm not old anymore\ " - < PROPMALE > " 
Spring Play Auditions last much longer than one would expect ! 
Yay !!! I am < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Urgh . Just realized I lost the folder with all of my homework in it ! Bah ! 
Ever get those days where you sit down with a plate of spaghetti and you remember how you used to dump as much parmesean and chili peppers and other stuff into it as possible and it tasted like heaven , so years later you do it again and you're surprised because , omg , this tastes like CRAP ? 
Just finished memorizing my entire ( long-ass ) poem for the poetry out loud thing in like 20 minutes . Procrastination is going to be the death of us all ! 
Spent like 4 hours at the mall . Bought a salad . FUN ! 
Clement : I can write songs ! I can write ! Shoooot ... I was writing before < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > was in diapers ! 
Clement : Did you know that if every fat person in the world fell , there'd be Tsunamis ? 
Has been struck by boredom . Whether she'll recover remains to be seen . 
No school today ? Sweet ! I overslept anyway ! 
Oh man . HAPPY NEW YEARS FOLKS ! Hella ' fun . =D 
Spent all day sitting around in bed and now my butt is numb . Winter sucks ! 
Question : Does anyone know how long the Spanish descriptions in the project have to be ? 
\A broken heart is easy to steal . \"" 
Okay , so the brownies are done , a little burnt and they're not all that visually appealing , but I think they are okay in terms of taste . Woo ! 
\True happiness comes from having a white sheep and a black sheep . \""

Eating Funyuns in bed while watching awkwardly dubbed anime on Netflix and doing Algebra homework . Oh yeah , this is a good day . 
Noti's whisker stabbed me in the eye ( my good one ! ) . How does that even happen ?! 
I got a pocket , got a pocket full of sunshine !
