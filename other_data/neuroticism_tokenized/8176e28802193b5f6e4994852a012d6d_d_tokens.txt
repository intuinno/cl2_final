Why is it when i try to be funny no one lifes and when im not trying to be funny its halarious o.o always kind of woundered that :p 
Its funny , when your younger you dream about how awesome it will be growing up , but once you reach the age , you realize it sucks and want to be young again , too bad time can only go forward ... 
Why cant I be another person .... i sometimes hate my life ... 
Im alright now just having my yearley break down lol :3 
my laptop needs to stop being dumb x.x 
Dreams , are they really good ?, think about it when you have a good dream it usually involves things you would love to to have , yet you dont . when you wake up you realize you dont have them which can make some people sad , nightmares make you glad your back to reality when you wake up , now think about it wich one truley is the good one ;3
