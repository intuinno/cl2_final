que pela pacquiao < PROPFEMALE > dio a cotto ... i kinda knew it , but kinda bittersweet ... oh well , cotto gave a good fight ... 
@starbucks , studying and getting my coffee !! 
raining AGAIN !!!! ENOUGH ALREADY !! 
so my roommate says the power came back @ the house , but it started raining again ... I'm afraid if I leave starbucks to go to the house , power will go out again ... what should I do ? Go home , or stay at starbucks with the cheesy music for another couple hours until I have to head to campus ? 
waiting for the rain to taper a bit so I can get from starbucks to my car without getting soaked to the bone ... have to register for next semester's courses and then class ... somehow supposed to find time to cook dinner before I go to class ... I'm on a mission !! 
finally !! power is back ( hopefully ) to stay !! 
* crossing fingers * hopefully the power is here to stay for real this time ... 
so I wasn't able to register my courses yesterday because the rain made me ridiculously late ... I went this morning , waited an hour , only to find out I didn't even have to register because courses that continue from the previous semester are automatically registered ... at least I have my courses all set for next semester !! :D
