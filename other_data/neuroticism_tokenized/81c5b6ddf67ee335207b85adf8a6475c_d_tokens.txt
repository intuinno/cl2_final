: Blast , now I wish I'd used the off-white felt and not the tan , since Naoto-kun has a rather fair complexion ... :P 
: ahhhh , starting on the jacket/hair/hat ~ !!! xD SO HYPED FOR FINISHED PRODUCT ! 
Tonight's goal : Naoto gets hair . No if's , and's or but's about it . 
: ... on second thought , I think Naoto can stand to go one more night without hair . At least she has a jacket now xD ( it still needs the houndstooth collar , but it's got the school's emblem on the front ! ) 
: Okay , show of hands (/comments/likes ) , who would classify me as ' moe' ? ( that's ' moe ' as in ' moe-ay ' or ??, not the name Moe :P ) 
: Sometimes when it's raining outside , I get this urge to go for a walk and get soaked . So I put a dry towel by the door , find some crappy flip flops , and go for a nice leisurely stroll until my urge is satisfied . :) 
: Stumble + ADD + a string of days off , interrupted by a work day = Pi scrambling to get ready in time . 
: Ugh , I can't figure out how to make Naoto's hat ! D < Blast ! 
: Happy Pi Day !!!! *^^* ( get it ? cuz it's 3/14 ? ) 
: -_-; ... Now I want to make Mameshiba plushies . SO CUTE !

: Colcannon recipe was a success ! \\(^o^ )/ My parents and I are having it with sausages tomorrow night for St. < PROPFEMALE>'s Day ( they're not huge fans of corned beef * shrug *) 
: I feel like crap so I'm going to bed . This has to be a record for me ( it's 10:45 pm ) . Happy St. < PROPFIRST>'s Day :3 
: I feel so rested and happy today *^^*

: \This is a music room after all . \ " ^^ " 
: I love animal crackers *^^* Especially the ones that are almost unrecognizable as any known species of animal

Pi's quick fix to beat the heat = frozen grapes and mandarin orange segments , and peach Jello ! *^^* I feel so much better 
: I'm kinda glad < PROPMALE > icing doesn't taste like much ' ~') otherwise my mock-Schroeder outline would probably cease to exist . 
: KYAHHHHHH *^^* SO CUTE . ( not telling WHAT though , cuz I'm sworn to secrecy .. -ish ) 
: gotta wrap this Psyc paper up so I can make < PROPMALE > icing for Manida before class ! ^^ pretty good motive , imo 
;_; I freakin ' HATE stink bugs . I just got dive-bombed by one in my kitchen while trying to eat my dinner ... and now I'm afraid to go back in there . 
: So I started watching Sailor < PROPFEMALE > ( English subs ) on Youtube ... -_-;; what have I gotten myself into ..... ^^ ; 
: Arghhhh , I want roti prata now ..... -_-; Thanks a lot , Stumble . 
: Full < PROPFEMALE > sways ... gently in the night of one FINE day ... *^^* 
: argh , I need/want more sheet music .... -_-;
