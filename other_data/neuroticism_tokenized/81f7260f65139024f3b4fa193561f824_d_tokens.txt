Best shit I've read in school all year : Clearly , the real cry of these environmental justice advocates goes beyond the familiar “NIMBY , ” or “not in my backyard . ” These activists are instead crying “BANANA” - “build absolutely nothing anywhere near anything” or , as one activist insisted , “NOPE” - “not on planet earth . ”\

We're at about 30 billion tons of annual CO2 emissions and rising 3 percent per year . By 2020 , we'll be over 40 billion tons annually . If we average more than 18 billion tons of CO2 a year this century , we risk widespread desertification , sea level rise ( of 80 feet or more ) and the loss of up to 70 percent of all species . - < PROPFIRST > Romm , PhD - Physics , MIT
