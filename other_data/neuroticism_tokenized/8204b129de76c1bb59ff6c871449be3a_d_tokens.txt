Packers/Steelers Superbowl . Didn't necessary pictured that as the superbowl about a month ago but it has the potential to become one of the greatest superbowls of all-time 
You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you 
Things always happen(or not happen ) for a reason . I get it and understand it but now I have to learn to deal with it . 
< PROPFIRST>'s Day is the world's celebration of love . But why do many of us wait till that day to show and tell their loved ones that they care about them ? We must express our love for our family and friends daily . So I'm taking this opportunity to tell all the wonderful people in my life that ' I LOVE YOU\ !!! :) " 
\Feed your faith and your fears will starve to death \""
