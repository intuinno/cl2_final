Honor THEM by reposting ? 
A very TRUE statement < PROPFEMALE > ! A True friend doesn't care when you're broke , what you weigh , if your house is a mess , about your past , or if your family is filled with crazies . They love you for who you are . A true friend can go long periods of time without speaking to you and never question the friendship . Repost if you have at least one true friend . They will know who they are . 
Happy Halloween everyone !! Have a spooooooktacular day . 
Happy Thanksgiving ! Have a safe holiday ! 
Holidays are tough ; wish heaven had a phone .. so I could hear your voice again . I thought of you today , but that's nothing new . I thought of you yesterday and days before that too . I think of you in silence and often speak your name . All I have are memories and pictures in a frame ... repost if you have someone in heaven that you miss on earth ! 
Change your FB profile picture to a cartoon from your childhood . The goal ? To not see a human face on FB till Monday , December 6th . Join the fight against child abuse & copy & paste to your status to invite your friends to do the same !

Hey ! Village Idiots picketing fallen soldiers ' funerals .... Yeah , I'm talking to you ! Do you know WHY you are allowed to do that ? BECAUSE THE DEAD SOLDIER YOU ARE DISRESPECTING GAVE HIS OR HER LIFE SO YOU WOULD HAVE THE FREEDOM TO EXPRESS YOUR STUPIDITY ! Feel free to copy and post-I did because I wasn't afraid to express my undying gratitude to every single service person past , present and future !!! 
Just had Papa Murphy's Smore's dessert pizza . OMG that is soooooo sinfully good . 
Yardwork , how I loathe thee . 3 hrs weed eating knee high grass , I believe a < PROPFEMALE > sunrise would be good about now . 
Enjoyed a 7 mile walk to the nature center and back home with my son . Next week -- a 15 mile walk to the dam and back .
