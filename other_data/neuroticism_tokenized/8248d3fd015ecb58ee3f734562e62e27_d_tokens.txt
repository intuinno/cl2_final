Even Satan believes in God . There's got to be a DIFFERENCE in the way we live our life . -- Just a thought . 
Jesus has been our joy , hope , peace , future , love and comfort . He’s our superhero , our heavenly daddy , our mentor , our best friend , our everything . We know He has a plan for our lives and we know this life isn’t about us . We strive everyday to become more and more like our heavenly father and pray that people can see Him in us . He must become more and we must become less . -- Mallea Berglund ( a true Jesus Freak )

You were born an orginal . Don't die a copy . 
So what are you waiting for ? What do you have to lose ? Your insecurities try to alter you . You know you're made for more . So don't be afraid to move . Your faith is all it takes and you can walk on the water too . <3 
But you never said the road would be easy , but you said that you would never leave . And you never promised that this life wasn`t hard , but you promised you`d take care of me . So I`ll stop searching for the answers , I`ll stop praying for an escape , and I`ll trust you , God , with where i am , and believe that you will have your way . \ 
Just have your way <3

Hasole .. mhhmmmm :) I LOVE < PROPFEMALE > QUIETT ! 
Every movement we make in response to God has a ripple effect , touching family , neighbors , friends , community . Belief in God alters our language . Love of God affects daily relationships . Hope in God enters into our work . None of these movements and responses , beliefs and prayers , gestures and searches , can be confined to the soul . They spill out and make history . 
First God . God its the subject of life . God is foundational for living . If we don't have a sense fo the primacy of God , we will never get it right , get life right , get OUR lives right . Not God at the margins ; not God as an option ; not God on the weekends . God at the center and circumference ; God first and last ; God , God God . <3
