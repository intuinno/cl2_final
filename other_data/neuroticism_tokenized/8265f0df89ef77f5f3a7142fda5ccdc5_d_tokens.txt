It came to mind in the early morning yesterday . As if I gathered broken pieces of glass ? \ 
Blood drips from my cut fingures . Is this what we really hoped for ? 
The dark clouds gather to the tune of the rumbling sea . The winds of the tempest begin to ring . The enigmatic words make the witches chuckle . While the banquet of this irregular night repeats . 
Dude I think I've found my twin . ; u ; 
Peace cannot be kept by force . It can only be achieved by understanding .
