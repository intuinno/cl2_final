What a new years beginning ..... humph .... 
Is spending the evening wil two boys . well , they arent my species , but that doesnt count or anything ^^ 
Its surprising how much cissexism i've been seeing in the trans community . surprising and sad 
has run outta organic mints . darn 
is not a very cheerfull boy atm ...... feeling quite horrid . 
had such a great time today with True Colors with his job shadow . i met some great new friends and got to see the video of Kamora Herrington on the < PROPFEMALE > show :D epic and a half 
i see your true colors shining through , i see yout true colors and thats why i love you ^^ great conference this year , cant wait for the next one 
is slowly working on coming out and transitioning in his school . thank you to everyone who is trying and calling me < PROPMALE > , and those who are so amazing and using male pronouns . yea there are still the assholes , but the good helps a bit 
fucking hell . please someone , tell me what i should do . apparently the admin at my school told one of my teachers that i wasnt allowed to be called < PROPMALE > . i blame him , because instead of just calling me < PROPMALE > , he had to go tp the horrid admin at my school . i better not have to go back to my legal name .... any advice , can they do that ? 
dont be disillusioned by my soul .... 
well my day is made ^^ 
i want a quiet life , free from regret . something so simple , everyone would forget 
fuck it all ^^ 
fucking rawr 
im letting you go , i'll set you free . and wai'll you see what you need to see . when you find you .... come back to me .... 
If I should be so bold I’d ask you to hold my heart in your hand . I’d tell you from the start how I longed to be your man . But I never said a word . I guess I’ve gone and missed my < PROPMALE > again 
In some ways , one of the hardest thing to deal with in life is others perception of you . but you have to get past that , and be true to yourself , or you will never be truely happy 
its ok , that you had to go away . just remember the telephones work both ways . but if i never ever hear them ring , if nothing else i'd think the bells inside had found someone else , and thats ok . cuz i remember everything you say . - < PROPFIRST > Miraz ftw ^^ 
all i can feel is the realness im faking 
When i look in the mirror , what i have to hold on to is what i will someday see 
no , im not a girl . dont tell me i am . dont tell me to get over it . yea my body is . but im a guy , so you can shove your opinion . keep your ignorance to yourself 
Somebody turn the lights on , somebody tell me whats wrong . i'd be lying if i told you loosing you was something i could handle 
wrong or right , black or white , if i close my eyes its all the same 
Is trying but never fails to mess up in some way . damn . 
Ok , so last thing regarding names . im keeping < PROPMALE > as my first name . but im looking for a middle name with more meaning to it .... something that would mean something like strength , freedom or something like that . ANY suggestion would help . thank you ! 
In a sick puppies and blue october mood 
Don't walk away , and leave without a reason when there's too much to say that hasnt been said . i know i was wrong , im sorry for making the same mistakes . don't walk away -ah i love sick puppies 
got to see my brother for about ( literally ) 20 seconds today . idk , i love seeing him but its hard becase my mom always makes him leave so quickly

“Sometimes I wish I were a little kid again , skinned knees are easier to fix than broken hearts . ” 
well hell . only so much a boy can do 
at least now i know 
If your reading this , it means i need space from everything . that sadly means people too . so give me a bit on my own , and i'll come back later . this will also help me stop emotionally throwing up on people , which im sure you will appreciate . peace , - < PROPMALE >

So i got a tux for prom . which is all nice . but the dude who helped out said he could ' tell i was a girl ' -cue balloon air fizzing out- 
so i learned something yesterday . that before i was born , all the doctors and my parents thought i was supposed to be a boy . i had high testosterone levels , and the ultrasound confirmed it . i was always ment to be a boy , i just came out different 
you may say that im a dreamer . but im not the only one 
ahhhhhhhhhhhhh tomorrow morning is when i found put if i made it in the speech contest or not : < i so nervous . what if i didnt get in ???? 
Our ltds are proof that sex and gender are much more complex than a delivery room doctor's glance at can determine , more variegated than pink or blue birth caps . we are oppressed for not fitting those narrow social norms . we are fighting back . - < PROPFIRST > feinberg 
We all have a stake in challenging restrictive attitudes toward human behavior and self-expression . - < PROPFIRST > fienberg 
Is going back where pride all started for him , north hampton pride today ! i cant beleive how far i have come in two years

Is learning that he has to pick his battles . i cant fight the world , but i can attempt to change it , one small step at a time 
welcome to the family , < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > , and coujo kogut :) 
You take the breath right out of me , you left a hole where my heart should be 
It doesnt matter that im actually happy now , i'll never be able to get the nagging thought out of my head that it was i , who broke apart my family 
Family's not a thing , its a place . It's where all the memories get kept . 
My cousins advice on being more manly : beer , football , and a casual indifference to everything :D lol i love my family

You said i signed off on my right to be free , but the truth is that i never agreed 
Melt plastic and make me breath it in 
Stuff pinecones up my nose 
Feed me to < PROPFEMALE > the pit bull 
Peal off my skin with tweezers 
Forceably shove apples down my throat 
Drown me in dump dirt 
Slam my head in a sliding door 
Choke me with potato peals 
Shoot me with a rabbit 
Kill me with a spoon 
Have pigs eat out my eyeballs 
Strangle me with sheets 
Have < PROPFEMALE > try to talk intelligently to me , That'll be torture for the both of us 
Where is the love ? Madness is what you demonstrate 
Gotta keep my faith alive till love is found 
I sometimes forget that i can make people uncomfortable by just being who i am

Toy story 3 made me want to go and hug my old stuffed < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > . then i remember i sold her to my friend for 10dollars in 6th grade XD 
is going to do his resume today , and send it to < PROPFEMALE > Kogut . but he can only do it after 3 , because his dad put the stupid computer lock on his account , so he cant get to his files till after 3 :P 
my name , as of 11:47 on june 23rd , 2010 , is legally < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Kogut :D :D 
I dont like being alone , because it gives me nope time to think about things i dont think about when im otherwise distracted . 
cleaning his room , so when Skylar Spear comes over he wont , you know ..... die . its still messyish , but i think all hazards are clear 
Nothing is nope creepy than my grandma talking to herself/the cats 
So , because i needed to fill the prescription , i will start t friday . Its so hard to wait ! But its so close 
tomorrow im going to learn how to shove a really long needle into my thigh muscle . woot ! cant wait to start t !! :D 
Can't wait to start tricking my sex to become my gender . eight and a half hours till t time ! ^^ 
That wasnt scary at all im officially on t ! 
now that im on t- tips for being a healthier Max : stop drinking soda , not as much junk food , and buy a wallgreens rip off thing that is supposed to make your stomach small :P 
Let it go . Let it roll right off your shoulders . Dontcha know ? The hardest part is over 
Im just trying to keep it together , cuz i could do worse , and you could do better 
Our lives are made in these small hours , these little wonders , these twisted turns of fate 
hey transguys out there who self inject into the thigh : how long does it take till your thigh stops aching ? just wondering ........... 
Packing for california i may need a bigger suitcase ..... 
Nothing to do . Rawr 
Its the heart that really matters in the end 
Close your eyes , clear your heart . Cut the chord .... 
Is going to have to take his lip ring out , he thinks 
the only stuff ima be eatin for a while : fruits , veggies , eggs and dairy . 
All my regret i feel will wash away somehow , but i wont forget how i feel now 
Feeling sick and tired . Literally . Bed time 
To all my bay area friends : stay safe ! Be carefull and stay inside 
One week on t ! :D my voice is noticeably lower , and i have the start of muscles ! 
Depression isn't a weakness , its a sign of trying to be too strong for too long . put this as your status if you've known someone who has been depressed . one in three people will suffer from depression in their lifetime . show your support for those who may suffer 
Pasta+butter+italian dressing+honey mustard chicken+cheese = effin heaven ! 
Are we scared to look inside , or will we dare to take the ride ? 
Sometimes you gotta dig really deep , and fight like an animal to survive , but there will come a day when you can look back and say ' it was worth it , the pain was all worth it , because now im happy and im me ' -T.F last group tomorrow :( im going to miss you guys like crazy , but i honestly cant be more thankfull to have been able to spend time with such wonderfull and inspiring people . it was all worth it . 
Its 2 in tha morning and i cant sleep . Im quite happy cuz my voice is gettin deep . I play < PROPFEMALE > like some people count sheep , i charm girls and they go ' meep 
worry about california : i'll be living full time as < PROPMALE > -Yay ! - but i dont know how i'll be able to bind every day . I've done it so much , that it hurts badly :( 
Reason #1 im moving : i can always be myself 
Fuck this not sleeping . Daymn .... 
Reason 2 for moving : so people can come visit an amazing city :D 
Reason 3- gettin away from drama . Not that there wont be any at all in cali .... but you know 
Show me what i'm looking for 
Hold your own , know your name , and go your own way 
I think the worst part is that i still care what people think 
Here i go , can we take it from the top ? 
Im through with doubt . there'res nothing left for me to figure out . i've paid a price , and im still paying 
I just wish i could do more . is it so naive that i want to help people , to change the world ? 
All packed for california .... a week early
