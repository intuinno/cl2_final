Someone reported me for some reason or the other . My account was Disabled , so I had to make a new Facebook . 

\I can do all things through Him who strengthens me . \ " \ 
I like to wear the jacket you gave me , it's like a temporary hug ; until I get to see you again . \ 
\ 
Plus it has a white tiger on it , how bad-ace is that ? >:} 
Long-distance ANYTHING is always difficult and frustrating . :3 
I just brushed my cat's teeth , with meat flavored dog toothpaste . He didn't like it , not one bit . :\\ At least his breath doesn't smell like tuna fish anymore when he meows . 
\I know that there is nothing better for people than to be happy and to do good while they live . That each of them may eat and drink 
This class is gay . These kids are gay . This phone is gay . Everything is being homosexual today . 
When I say I like < PROPFEMALE > Manson , people flip out & rant about how much he sucks and \How on earth could you like him or his music ?! \ " But then 
Can a man < PROPFEMALE > fire next to his chest\ 
and his clothes not be burned ? \ 
Or can one walk on hot coals\ 
and his feet not be scorched ? \

The male gender disgusts me ... some are just absolute pigs . 
So many thoughts are going through my head . I don't know what to think , I'm confused . I hate thinking . 
I had the best time , belly dancing is SO fun !

Black popcorn is nasty . 
I forget just how good a plain Ritz Cracker can be . P :

\Have you any idea why the < PROPFEMALE > is like a writing desk ? \ " \ 
< PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland\ 
< PROPFEMALE > and Hatter had a mad connection . They should have kissed . \ 
Hatter had said to < PROPFEMALE > , \you're always either too short or too tall\ " while facing each other ; with a fond look in his eyes . He also was moofle when she was leaving 
When I was a little kid ... \ 
I never saw just how crappy everything really is . What happened to the magic and wonder ? \ 
I guess it's still there ... if I were to look hard enough . I remember how it use to be , but life just doesn't feel like that anymore . I guess it really is something you can call a \one in a life time experience . \ " \ 
People are idiots . 
I thought a snow day would be awesome , but ... it's actually pretty depressing . There's nothing to do , and the day is going extra slow . 
People need to read some of the The Bible , and learn what the heck they are talking about . \ 
Where are they getting their resources ? The media or their stupid friends . \ 
Granted ... I may be a baby in Christianity , but I know my stuff . I just wish people had things to back up what they are stating , even if it's wrong .. at least it would make sense as to why they think that . Eh whateverrr . :P

Drawing ... 
So I was looking at this person's album on Facebook . There was one , with just themselves . A second one with them and another person . A third one , with them and 4 people ... and people just kept adding up in each picture . \ 
And I thought to myself , \ 
\I really want to play some Pokemon Snap on the 64 . \ " \ 
I can't put together a bunch of random parts .. \ 
Especially when I'm missing the instruction booklet , I don't even know what tools I need to do this . This doesn't seem very possible . \ 
It's like being blind , and painting without a paint brush . Or being death and owning a guitar , and trying to start your own band ... when you don't even have the fingers to play the instrument . \ 
T.T 
Man , people are always getting to go do stuff ... and hanging out with one another . \ 
All I ever get to do is sit around in my house , go to school , and have a person come over every once in a while . \ 
So boringgg . \ 
I look forward to my future , when I actually have a job and I'm going to college . I'm going to travel and be doing interesting things all the time . I'm going to make a < PROPFIRST > . 
85% of my friend-list are made up of Idiots ! AHHH ! 
I look forward to the future .

Anyone want to hangout or do something today ? Message me and let me know . 
That new show coming on Adult Swim , if it hasn't already been shown on it ... Mongo Wrestling Alliance ; looks like it is going to completely blow . \ 
I really dislike the animation style . 
I hate being ill . \ 
Also , \ 
People are jerks . 
They need to make the Bartimaeus Trilogy movie . \ 
Or Warriors . \ 
Though , I think Warriors would be more of an animated series ... rather than a movie . Because that would be a little over 33 movies , if they went by the number of books . 
Who wants to download a book ? \ 
I enjoy going out and hand purchasing it , opening it up , turning pages , and placing a book < PROPFIRST > where I had to stop . \ 
In the future , all books will be online . Barnes and < PROPMALE > will have a website you can order from . Kids will have personal computers , & color in pictures on it , rather than buying a coloring book from some store . \ 
I don't look forward to this . 
It amazes me . Just HOW stupid can a person be ? \ 
Obviously this goes beyond stupidity , this hits just about ; or a little over .. retardation . \ 
Nate Foote is the most amazing person . I can't believe he's my boyfriend , I'm so incredibly lucky to have him in my life . 
Another day of nothing . \ 
Yay . \ 
Anyone have any plans tonight ? I'm bored with nothing to do . \ 
Private message or IM me , and let me know if you want to hangout . 
Sometimes I 
I want some Sweet Tarts , or Skittles . \ 
P : 
ISN'T IT JUST SO ANNOYING WHEN SOMEONE TYPES IN ALL CAPITAL LETTERS ? \ 
YELLING FOR NO REASON AT ALL . \ 
LIKE THEY ARE LITTLE TEENAGERS , TRYING TO BE NOTICED IN A CHAT ROOM . \ 
IT'S SO OBNOXIOUS , \ 
DON'T YOU THINK ? 
Irritated urethra . \ 
Hmm . \ 
P :\ 
What was your first mental image , when you read those two words . 
I just remembered that , I had a dream ... about a < PROPFEMALE > cane . \ 
I was in class , and I had a HUGE < PROPFEMALE > cane . I threw it across the room , to the trashcan ; but I ended up hitting someone right in the eye . There was blood everywhere . \ 
It was horrible . \ 
But funny .. 
NO YOU MF ! D:< \ 
... \ 
...... \ 
( Mayonnaise Foof ) 
Leather jacket , bandanna , and sunglass ... those are all super cool . \ 
Not to mention ... \ 
They are also very attractive and mysterious .. \ 
Then again , I'm weird . P : 
So I just found out Green Day has 2 side bands . \ 
I'm falling in love with their music , all over again . \ 
:3 Ahhhhhh . 
So , Union Public Schools called my phone ... no school tomorrow . \ 
I'm thinking that , there will most likely be no school on Wednesday either ... \ 
This is great but , the only downside is ; I've nothing to do . \ 
:\\ 
Humans disgust me . 
I am logging off of the computer , and away from the phone ; for the time being . \ 
I require isolation . 
At night , all cats are gray . 
Out of order . 
Do you ever stop , and find yourself ... asking ; why ? 
Whoever said Paper beats Rock is a complete and utter idiot . Next time I hear someone say that , I will throw a rock at them ; while they hold up a sheet of paper in front of their face . 
When summer comes , I want to go to the Zoo ; and make a day of it . \ 
Not the Tulsa Zoo though , the OKC Zoo ... or maybe the Jenks Aquarium . \ 
And I would definitely like to go out to see movies , It's been a long time since I've gotten out for a movie ... or for anything really . \ 
I also want to go camping , and hiking . \ 
I want to do a lot of things this summer . \ 
Normally I do nothing . 
OMGSH ! I just saw a < PROPFIRST > Beiber Proactiv commerical ... \ 
Quick , fetch me some spoons .. \ 
I need to gouge my eyeballs out of my sockets !!! 
Bored . 
I hate mother effing snow ! D:< 
Why couldn't it have snowed before and on Christmas ? \ 
I really hate this . 
Facebook IM , you are pissin ' me off ! \ 
D:< 
Pour half of her conditioner out , and fill the rest of it with Nair . \ 
It works every time . 
An omelette with just cheese , that's not even and omelette .. \ 
That's like a ... chegg ? 
I love how people don't tell me when dinner is ready , so I can not eat . 
I think my right arm died . 
Away . 
... eh . 
I just woke up . -_o 
I need to vent some hot hair , but ... I can't . \ 
Something is blocking the passage ways . 
I slept until 6pm today , and I'm still tired . 
Is watching Bleach . 
Today at 6pm , it's suppose to start snowing ... and last until - 9pm Wednesday . \ 
They said it will get really heavy around midnight tonight , and stay pretty heavy until 6am tomorrow . \ 
I wonder if we'll be having school tomorrow , or the next day . Hmm ... \ 
Did I mention I hate snow ? 
I am SERIOUSLY getting so danged tired of hearing \Fireworks\ " by that stupid < PROPFEMALE > Hairry or whatever . \ 
Well , it's 6:07 AM . Time for sleep . \ 
-o- ; 
< PROPFIRST > Beaver gets his own movie ? What bullsniz ! I can't believe this , I hope that kid gets assassinated . 
Popcorn Kernel Gun .. \ 
Do they have those ? 
Playing FH . 
I'm tired of being 17 and not even having a drivers permit or license . I'm tired of not having a job , I'm tired of sitting around doing nothing . 
I'm feeling optimistic . :D 
If I were to cosplay anything ... \ 
It would either be Sheik from < PROPFEMALE > , Blue from Wolf's Rain , Tatsuki from Bleach , or Houndoom from Pokemon . \ 
I keep dryer sheets in my pockets , always . 
I'm hearing a lot about Little Big Planet , is it a good game ? P : 
This is not fun . 
Is it just me , or when people say something about VD ( instead of saying Valentines Day ) ... does it remind you of an STD ? 
I was finally was able to fall asleep around 6AM-ish , and then my brother wakes me up being loud and inconsiderate of peoples sleep around 8:30 Am-ish , and I'm still awake now because he won't stop SINGING . I need sleep ! OMGSH D:< 
I managed to work in three hours of sleep , before waking up for school ... joy . \ 
The minute I get home from school , I'm going to crash . That sucks , because then I will be wide awake later tonight , the bad sleeping cycle will continue ! \ 
D: \ 
And might I add , I HATE school ; I am ready to graduate . I hate waking up early , riding the bus , and seeing idiots every day . I wish I could fast forward to ten years from today .

So at the end of Februrary , Union Public Schools are adding thirty minutes to the end of each day for the rest of the year . So three thirty the highschool will get out . 
Pissed of and depressed , I don't even know why I look at those things ; I just get upset . T.T I'm so stupid . 
Lol , Is anyone watching Family Guy right now ? The one with < PROPFEMALE > just getting out of prison ? It's greaaat . :3 
Does anyone want to give me a ride to church today ? T.T I know it's useless asking , but what the heck ; might as well . 
D: No ! 
How many kangaroos does it take to fix a leaky water main ? \ 
\ 
Well ... \ 
None , a kangaroo has neither the intelligence nor dexterity to do any kind of plumbing work . At best it could try to locate the source of the leek by jumping around , but even then it would be hard pushed to actually do anything about it . 
Off to Church , then back home . :P \ 
Why is there no aspirin in the jungle ? \ 
Because , it would not be financially viable to attempt\ 
to sell pharmaceuticals in the largely unpopulated\ 
Rain < PROPMALE > . 
Never before have I been so verbaly bluntly hit on . So creepy ! Most awkward bus ride ever . 
It's amazing , my computer is actually working .... 
Plans for tomorrow :\ 
Wake up\ 
Church\ 
Tulsa Zoo\ 
Home\ 
Then maybe see my boyfriend ? \ 
I want to sleep in ... :\\ 
So In class today , we watched the movie < PROPFEMALE > . I never heard of her or about her until today , and her story is REALLY sad . :\\\ 
Her music is also really good . 
I have to be at school by 10:45 AM for only 5 minutes on Wednesday , who wants to take me ? \ 
( No one ! :D Yeah ! )\ 
>.> \ 
<.< 
Sometimes I just have to wonder . 
Sun Flower Seeds : Chili-Lime flavor , they are so good . P : 
Oddly enough , it seems like Facebook is dead tonight . \ 
o . 0 
I am beyond disappointed with myself , therefore I am going back to sleep . \ 
If you need to talk to me , or want to make plans for today ; call me . 
People who do drugs are idiots . 
Today is really sucking ... 
I miss my boyfriend . :\\ 
I just love how people text me back . ( not ) 
In class today until 3:05 . Oh joy . T.T 
So yesterday , I looked really pretty , and I also did today too ; but it makes me mad . The camera NEVER captures what I'm seeing when I look in the mirror . Maybe I'm crazy , and just look super ugly today ; and the camera is actually portraying the truth . \ 
I dunno . But I do know , that I am highly annoyed ; because the pictures turn out NOTHING like how I look in person . \ 
T.T ughh . 
Youtube is pissing me off ! D:< 
I am bored out of my mind ... 
I'm in Algebra 1 . I've failed the test for it 3 times now ; and I still have to retake it at the end of the year . \ 
So why , I ask ; do they put me in Intermediate Algebra which is more difficult than Algebra One ? \ 
It's hard to understand , I don't finish it all ; and I don't know if I get half of the questions right . I'm 2 assignments behind , and I was absent today which means ; even more work tomorrow . >.<;; 
Ugh , I keep seeing things that are pissing me off . T.T 
I wish I had something to do this evening . \ 
I also wish that , people would take notice ; of the agonizing thorns that I bare . 
Nuh uh , no , no way , nope ... huh uh . 
Off to schoo ! 
Wants to do something tonight . :\\ 
I like bevers . 
Wish people wouldn't go IDLE , whilst in the middle of a conversation on Facebook IM ; >:{ Grr ! 
Bedtime . -o- 
The ferrets ran off with the Wii remotes , and hid them ; in a pile of their feces ... greattt . >.<;; 
So , a situation happened with someone ; and they told me about it . I have never been faced with information such as this , and I don't know how to take it . I don't know if I Should feel angry , jealous , upset , worried ... or just brush it off my shoulder like nothing . \ 
I do know though , that it does bother me ; by far . \ 
I'm angry and worried , but I'm just glad I have video games ; too keep reality off my mind . :) 
I've been playing The Legend of Zelda : Twilight < PROPFEMALE > for 9 hours now . I'm in the Goron Mines . 
I'm trying to play video games , but ... I can't stop thinking . I had to turn off the Wii . And now I'm just sitting in my room with my cat , THINKING . I hate this . \ 
Today just isn't the usual , it's not the normal AM/PM routine . I need at least one phone call , just to hear that one voice ... I feel empty . I hate change , even if it's the most minuscule of one . \ 
I'm going to be awake until 5 probably . Ugh . \ 
I'm angry . T.T 
Bored as heck . T.T 
Philippians 4:13 
I'll have what he's having . 
Have you ever loved someone so much , you just wanted to shout ; shout at the top of your lungs how much you love them ? Or go Super Saiyan , and just cause a massive explosion of love ; so everyone can know the greatness of the great stuff you are feeling ? \ 
Well , it really sucks ... cause ' I can't do any of those . All I can do is take a deep breath ; and try to calm down . 
I always find myself , browsing through my newsfeed ; and I think ... \Who the heck are you ?! \ " \ 
When someone says I like cheese ... or they say , \I like___\ " whatever it is they announce they like . \ 
< PROPFIRST > 6:44 -51 
Facebook , quit distracting me ! My game is on pause ! D:< 
Bored ... 
Why do people take photos incredibly close to their face ? \ 
To where , it makes you feel uncomfortable ; like the picture is going to kiss you . Don't people realize that there is such thing as bad photographs ? I don't know , maybe it's; kinda sorta just a whole lot of a smidge-bit creepy ? Or is it just me ? \ 
I feel like just from looking at the picture ; I'm going to receive a wiff of some wicked breath or something . 
I'm bored . >:\\ 
I'm bored , and pissed . I wish I had something to do on a Friday night . \ 
When < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > wants coffee , he grinds the beans with his teeth and boils the water with his own rage . 
Loves how people just sign off , very abruptly in mid conversation ; without even saying goodbye . \ 
OMGSH . \ 
People are so effing stupid , I swear ! 
I'm home , I had fun . I want a dress now though . >:{ 
You know , I've been thinking about it ... I actually want to go to Prom . >.<;; Especially if I had a really nice dress . \ 
Oh poo , this sucks . 
I wish I could just cut off my arm , so I could use it ; to reach the spot on my back that itches . \ 
>.<;; 
Thanks for cheering me up , and giving me a few laughs ; Facebook . 
Playing The Legend of Zelda : Twilight < PROPFEMALE > , probably for the remainder of the day ; too . 
I HATE CHAIN-LINK MAIL !!!!! \ 
Everyone is just ... \ 
Stupid . \ 
If I post something on someone's wall , then obviously ... I'm wanting some kind of a response . \ 
I hate when I post things on people's walls , because then they don't like it ; or comment on it . \ 
It makes me feel like a huge idiot . \

I'm not doing crap today . As always . 
I love doing group projects all by myself , it's great . 
I can't stand when people don't brush their teeth . 
My room smells like Eskimo's . 
I'm out of school early ... \ 
So , now what ? \ 
Vidnier gamez ? \ 
I think so ! \ 
:D 
Among The < PROPFEMALE > Possum , The Brushtail Possum , The Canadian Lynx , The Red Tailed Kangaroo , The Pygmy Shrew , The Siberian Wolf , The Capybara , The Giant Pouch Rat , The Mouse Deer , The Okapi , The The Patagonian < PROPFEMALE > , The Fossa , The Kangaroo Rat , The Ameraucana and The Aye-Aye ... \ 
I've decided to add The Wolverine and the Gulper Eel to my favorite animals . \ 
Also , I am so extremely bored right now . T.T '' 
Some things need to change . 
No , nuh uh , huh uh , I don't think so ... no way ; nope . 
Certain people on my news feed , JUST started dating someone ; they are already saying \I love you . \ " \ 
People are always changing ... getting cooler , I just sit here and watch it happen ; and it seems like I'm the only one who stays the same . \ 
I'm the sapling that never grew into a tree , rain never landed in my area ; and the other trees absorbed all of my light . \ 
I couldn't go through photosynthesis . \ 
Yep , that's me ; good old Sapling < PROPFIRST > . Boring , Uninteresting , and Awkward . \ 
Sapling's are freaking AWESOME , though .

I had forgotten how fun taking pictures are , at least ; when you're bored that is . P : 
Tomorrow is Wednesday , I wonder what I'll be doing ... \ 
I have the the most amazing boyfriend ever to exist . \ 
I'm very lucky . \ 
<3 
I wish there was some kinda huge mutant gopher , and it's diet consisted of mainly schools . Like , a clan of them came into Oklahomo ; and just devoured all of the schools . And every time they would try to rebuild them , it would just come ; and pimp slap the worker's in the face . \ 
Now I'm kind of picturing the Invader Zim hamster , Peepi ? That BIG hamster . Hamstergeddon , I think was the name of the episode . 
I'm so bored . I really want to play a Spyro or a Ratchet and Clank game , but we don't have any . T.T Ugh . 
Though there may be a lot of minor insignificant negative's in my life , I've noticed that ; I've never been more happier than I am now . \ 
I believe , that ; the positive's ... outweigh the negative's . \ 
So now I say , farewell to pessimistic < PROPFIRST > . 
What is with people not answering their phone's today ? 
About to go to sleep . P : 
I'm sick , I'm staying home today . 
It's a good thing I'm creative , otherwise ; I would ever know what to do . 
So , 60% < PROPMALE > of rain tomorrow . Hopefully it rains over here . \ 
I am wrapping things right now ... agh . I feel like I'm clothing a child . >.<;; \ 
I think , perhaps ... you could take this status in many wrong ways . \ 
Actually , I just thought of five . 
I would like to go horseback riding . Would anyone happen to know of any places in Oklahoma ? 
I really wish I didn't have to go to school . I just want to sleep all day . :\\ 
I just got done at my very first job interview , I think it went well . I'm excited ! :D 
I hate being the jealous and selfish person that I am , I'm so full of jealousy and anger ... I absolutely can not stand being that way . It makes me sick . \ 
But what am I to do , though ? Not much can be done ... 
I wish the girl's on Facebook would quit posting about prom , yeah it's tomorrow ; I get it . Now shut up . \ 
I also could care less if you are getting your nails , hair , skin , face , etc ... done . And I don't care about how you are getting your hair done , and what you are wearing . \ 
It's annoying . 
1 Corinthians 13:4 -7 
I am so bored right now . T.T \ 
At least tomorrow is Sunday , though . :3 
I hate when my dog freaks out at the front door , acting like someone is here ; it always disappoints me . 
So , I woke up at 5:40 ; and now I have an extra 50 minutes to burn . And I know if I shut my eyes for a little bit , I'll be asleep . Man , this sucks . I guess I could cook breakfast ? Ha , haha . 
My dad invited me to spend Easter Sunday with him , his wife and my grandma . \ 
My mom invited me to spend easter with her . If I don't , she'll be all by herself on Easter . \ 
I sort of would like to see my boyfriend though , too . \ 
Agh , decision's! What to do ? I need an opinion . 
I'm watching the new Family Guy . I have to say , I'm disappointed so far . 
I herd multiple cats . 
\Well 
Is going to church . 
I just got back from church . I am doing a whole lot of re-thinking things , not about God ; though . I think I needed that tonight . 
... some people are just so incredibly queer . T.T 
420 is dumb , people need to grow up . 
I wish I could sleep in .
