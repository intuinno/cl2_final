Your Love Language\ 
Quality Time\ 
In Quality Time , nothing says “I love you” like full , undivided attention . Being there for this type of person is critical , but really being there—with the TV off , fork and knife down , and all chores and tasks on standby—makes you feel truly special and loved . Distractions , postponed activities , or the failure to listen can be especially hurtful . 
so i'm not awake enough ...
