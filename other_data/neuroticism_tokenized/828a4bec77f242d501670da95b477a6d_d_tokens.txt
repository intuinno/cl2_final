Today was a really slow day in the restaurant . I didnt make any desserts ! & now my chef has challenged me to make the most discusting thing on the planet , for the dessert special tomorrow ; an Esspresso Cheese Cake w/Caramel sauce & a liquered Chantilly cr 
As you can see ... He is having me do it that exact way on purpose ! :)

As I was waking up this morning I pictured a man climbing up a mountain . He was as a man from book of mormon times , a prophet . He climbed carefully but dilibrately as if deep in thought , contemplating some important matters . 
I love < PROPFEMALE > Battistelli's song \Free to be me \"!!!" 
Do you know what is really sad ... \ 
Finding out that a friend of yours has chosen a different path than you would have expected them to . One that will lead them along the road of moral decay , unhappiness and spiritual death until you finally find them , lying at the bottom of a pile of all their choices in ultimate demise . \ 
This makes me want to cry .
