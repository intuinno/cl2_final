Dear facebook , you disapointed me in a dirastic way today . I suppose it isn't really your fault but I'm taking it out on you anyway . I now have strong feelings agenst you and your lack of cool groups to join . Not only that you have millions of the same type of group that no one would actually care about . Although you have a group for pomegranets . That really cheered me up . get a hold of your life facebook 
If anyone knows where to find some difficult connect the dots puzzles that would be great . Like a thousand dots , I saw a book in a store like that once and I really want to do one now but can't fine any .

A true friend doesn't care if you're broke , your house is a mess , or your family is filled with crazies ... they love you for who you are . A true friend can go long periods of time without speaking & never question the friendship . REPOST if you are lucky enough to have at least one true friend ! I hate these ' repost things but I liked this one . 
I really wish that the ' friend of the day ' crap would stop posting on my wall everyday . 
Dear Miley < PROPMALE > , growing up does NOT involve becoming a slut 
Post your favorite lyrics . Mine are as followed-\

I can see widows and orphans through my tears\ 
I know my call despite my faults\ 
And despite my growing fears\ 
But I will hold on hope\ 
And I won't let you choke\ 
On the noose around your neck\ 
And I'll find strength in pain\ 
And I will change my ways\ 
I'll know my name as it's called again

I don't know why I've been so very angry lately ... :/ 
I hate ants so much ... 
Bus driver said that we wen't allowed to cross the street . Even on the cross walk . Guess who crossed anyway and is never riding that bus again . 
What a nice walk home . Take that bus . 
I just realized I haven't seen another person's face sine I got home . Goodness ! 
Doing something I haven't done in a long time . Inshaling when I talk . All the while sing poker face ( I blame < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > :) ) . Anyway I'm enjoying it but my mom is not . 
Just finished watching my favorite movie , Little Miss Sunshine . It made me happy 
Falcons in my house , < PROPFEMALE > hives and shrek . Good times . 
Just listened to 500 < PROPMALE > way too many times on the way back from the beach . Way to go how I meet your mother . It's going to be stuck in my head forever now . 
So walking down the hall I passed a door and someone had taped a peice of paper on it that simply said Dumble . It was the highlight of my day 
Today was an angry day 
Enchanted < PROPMALE > makes me happy 
I just finished Ocarina of time- The ending was disatisfying to say the least 
dentest was yesterday and the orthodontist was today what fun . Everything's all good exept for the fact that my teeth hurt , I have a slight headache , and I can't sleep . Again it's all good though haha 
Computers not working . so for the next few days this is all through the wii ... which takes a while to type on 
Brother's wedding is tomarrow . For today , the rehersal . 
My second brother is off and married now . It was a good wedding . Congradulations to < PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > . 
I love movie nights where you don't actually watch movies but instead do things like make cotton < PROPFEMALE > and go to both harritt and brush college than come back to a bon fire 
I find it interesting that people consider writing an < PROPMALE > when truthfully all writting is , is thinking and putting it on paper . How odd that they would call thinking an < PROPMALE > . 
So excited to see the Avatar premere . I just watched way too much of the cartoon . 
I'm sure glad they chose to sign the decloration of dependence when they did . Any other season would be horrible for fireworks 
One Am and I already have 5 happy Birthdays on my wall . You guys rock . It's weird to think I've been around for 16 years or that could just be cause I'm tired :) 
It's been a long time since I updated this . So here it is . 
Accidently joined a twilight group thing here . Yeah ... Now I can't find out how to get out 
Try talking to me this week I dare you . Actually don't cause I won't reply at all . It's mission trip time . 
Native american healing circle , farm lands , lots of funny moments , white water rafting , very rushed showers . Quite a week . 
Disney , I'm really happy for you and I'm gonna let you finish , but < PROPFEMALE > had one of the scariest villains of all time . Not only in the movie but in history . 
I decided that if I'm not a phyciatrist , I'm gonna be a detective . Yeah that's right , and I'll wear a trechcoat and < PROPFEMALE > around little notebooks . 
bored ? this will keep you entertained for a while . I gaurentee it . \

Thank you life for this wonderfull sore throat right before school starts 
I guess I'll be seeing most of you guys tomorrow 
Is it weird that I can't drink Iced tea and feel right about it unless they'res vanilla ice cream to go along ? 
I know a dog that likes bottle caps . I just found out that my cat likes Q-tips 
Home from school today because I had to jump off a lttle ledge at lunch and land on my foot weird . Now it's swealled up and walkings hard . Also my phone deleted all my contacts , if you want me to have your number send me a message with it . 
Todays a take long naps and wear a bathrobe type of day . Also Fantasic Mr. Fox is a really good movie . 
Got back from the all nighter . Went to sleep a bit after seven . Just woke up . Now it's party time . :) 
Poll- I need to pick a person to use for an < PROPMALE > project . Can't decide between Dracula , Dr. Horrible or The Phantom of the Opera . Which person is best ? 
just made fire nation earrings from shrinky dinks . I have to say they're pretty awesome ... 
Happy 10/10/10 can't wait until 10:10 
I really didn't like today 
just expirianced what could have been my most awkward walk home yet due to the halloween costume , also I tried taking a new route and got a little bit lost and turned what is usually a half an hour walk into a 45 minute walk 
I'm quite bored . If you read this status you should post a comment saying the most interesting and misc . fact you know . 
Decided that if my plans for life don't work out I'm becoming a nun 
I warned my dad that if he kept leaving his facebook up I would change the language to pirate , and that's exactly what happened ... 
So I have a cat . This cat is horrible , to the point where it had to live in the garage . We recently let it back into a room in the house and while it was sleeping it growled . I swear that thing is a little monster 
Good day . Siblings came over , got a tree , drank some wonderful hot chocolate , watched a childhood cartoon with the family and then just got done with an hour and a half of DDR . Beat that . 
So during my sick day today , I slept for a really long time then woke up and made a big fort . 
I spent lots of today with some sort of < PROPMALE > song stuck in my head . Which is weird because I never listen to his music . Mainly Burning Love but it changed a lot . 
om·ni·pres·ent [ om-nuh-prez-uhnt]\ 
adjective\ 
present everywhere at the same time\ 
I love this word 
It's always kind of fun to have an < PROPMALE > teacher think of you when they see something Batman related and tell you about it later 
I got all excited about the idea of painting an egyption god on the back of the phone and didn't really think that people might want to contact me ... If need be send me a message or something 
I like chicken , I like liver , Meow Mix , Meow Mix please deliver . Guess what I've had stuck in my head all day 
I seem to have misplaced my telephone ... 
I've got a rat in my pocket :) 
I miss the good old days when Disney was good ... 
The one downside of going to a really good concert is listening to their music afterwards and knowing it'll never be as cool as when they preformed it live 
So I was pretty spacey and tired today which caused me to get on the wrong bus . I ended up in Lancaster where I waited to be picked up for a while , from there I went to Crossler because my dad was reffing wrestling there . When my mom came to pick me up from there I tripped and faceplanted in front of everyone in the bleachers . I'm ready for a nap
