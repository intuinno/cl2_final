< PROPFEMALE > Angelou 
I am soooooo GRATEFUL For who I am ! I would not ask GOD for another me ! 
This is how I feel about my grandma ,...... \Thank you < PROPFEMALE > ( grandma ) for helping God mold me into the person I am today ! You are an amazing woman \ " Madea\ " and I love you .... RIP < PROPFEMALE > ) " 
Life happens and then it Changes .... Always rely on God for everything because without Him , we can't make it ! 
Love is patient , love is kind . It does not envy , it does not boast , it is not proud . It is not rude , it is not self-seeking , it is not easily angered , it keeps no record of wrongs . Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth . It always protects , always trusts , always hopes , always persevers . LOVE NEVER FAILS ! 
One week till Christmas ! Going shopping for the Grandchillin's Today ! Yayyyyy ! 
My psychology classes are getting more and more challenging by the minute ....... \Taking prayers ! \ " Anyone offering ? :) " 
Happy birthday to Aniyah < PROPFEMALE > Selph ( 2 years old ) 
When you think you have a friend , he/she goes and turn on you , talk about you for no reasons other than their own . However , we are not responsible for how others treat us , but we are responsible for how WE treat others ! Have a great day FBF !

FACT : In the mid 1800's People caught teaching African-Americans would get arrested or have to pay large fines . Blacks caught learning would get a whipping or some other punishment . Even though it was very dangerous , many black people still learned . Some were taught at night . Others traded something for lessons . Slave children listened under school doors and learned as much as they could . 
Who was the first African American WOMAN elected congress , in 1968 ? And ... what did she declare four years later ?
