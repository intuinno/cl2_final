Thanks all of her friends for their amazing support when she truly , truly needed it , especially < PROPFEMALE > Nickell 
help me if you can , I'm feeling down , and I do appreciate you being ' round . Help me get my feet back on the ground . 
doesn't think she'll ever understand what her old best friend is thinking right now , and would only find out if she would talk to me about it ... 
when it rains it pours , and then someone shreds your umbrella , and then someone else steals your clothes , so you're forced to walk naked in the rain , and then you catch pnemonia . But at least your friends will warm you up with hugs . 
finished watching < PROPFEMALE > ... I love Joss , I really do . 
1 hour and 50 minutes to wonderfulness ! 
mmmmm ... < PROPFIRST > McHale ... yummmmmy .

HI ! 
my life is complete now ... just finished A Very Potter Sequel . Now I can die happy , but I won't in case they turn it into a trilogy .

Donde < PROPFEMALE > la bibloteca ? Me llamo T-Bone la aranea discoteca .

sometimes people just suck . I guess the problem with letting someone in to know all of your insecurities and flaws means they are able to later throw them back in your face . 
Is really excited to be looking at amazing internships . 
Well my MRI just got pushed back another two weeks ... grr this is frustrating . 
Today's project : put all of my CD's on my computer and re-sync my iPod ... and maybe do some more cleaning ... 
this appeared as a moral dilema cuz at first it was weird though I swore to eliminate the worst of the plague that devored humanity , it's true I was vague on the how , so can it be that you have shown me the light ? 
more work on the house today ... cleaning out the junk closest ... hooray 
Laying in bed , playing picross , listening to NSYNC and singing . All was well

Gotta love the special effects from 1984 . And the fact that everyone smokes like a chimney . 
I've decided that short curly hair does not help you look sane . Point in case : Einstein . 
\What do you mean by Korean made ? Do you mean I was made by Koreans ? Thanks < PROPFEMALE >!"

Change your facebook profile picture to a cartoon from your childhood & invite friends to do the same . Until Monday ( 12/6 ) there should be no human faces on facebook , but an invasion of memories . This is for violence against ... children .
