All of us have a thousand wishes . To be thinner , to be bigger , have more money , have a cool car , a day off , a new phone , to date the person of your dreams . A cancer patient only has one wish , to kick cancer's ASS . I know that 97% of you won't post this as your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do . In honor of someone who died , or is fighting cancer , or even had cancer , post this for at least one hour 
\I'll risk my happiness just to see you smile ; Even though it will last for a while ; As long as I know I'm doing my job right ; That smile of yours will never go out of my sight . \ " \ 
Teamwork is the ability to work together toward a common vision . The ability to direct individual accomplishment toward organizational objectives . It is the fuel that allows common people to attain uncommon results . ~ Andrew Carnegie
