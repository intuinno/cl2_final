I am so ready to pound someone . 
The naming of some things as important and others as unimportant is only a value of judgement , a product of human ego . 
Blah , I honestly don't care anymore . 
I'm the kind of girl who doesn't care what anyone thinks . As long as i know how things went , thats all that matters . I don't need people to tell who to be or how to act . I'm me , and I'm proud of it . If you got some problem then say it to my face or it's not even worth saying . 
Awww , i wanted another one T_T 
I really hate those moments when ur not sure about something and you really want to know whats going on , but your not sure how to ask and ur nervouse about how that person would respond ... Ahh , figures O_o 
What to do when ur bored at home ? \

They were like GO , and you were like RUN , nd then i was like BOOM (: haha , went painballing , it was hecka fun (: 
Would you say that it's indifference or the lack of interest when people who once would sit and not say a word , feeling not the need to , for they were at complete ease with each other , now walk past ingulfed in their own worlds with the slightest of resentment and act as if everything is fine ...? Most likely both .
