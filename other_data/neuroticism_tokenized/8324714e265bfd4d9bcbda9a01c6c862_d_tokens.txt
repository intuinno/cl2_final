Today is 9-9-9 ... kinda cool ! 

Got back late last night from Table Rock/Branson . Had a great week at the condo just hanging out , playing miniature golf and other games . < PROPMALE > caught dozens of fish and all the boys swam . Had a nice day at Silver Dollar City . SDC does fall decorations the best ! Love it there . < PROPMALE > rode WildFire ( rollercoaster ) for the first time ... he was finally tall enough . They got me on Powder Keg ... whoa ... was that a ride ! 
Cooked up one of Benjamins turkeys today , made dressing too . Yum ! Just a little warm-up for a Thanksgiving feast next month , I guess . 
Have some very sad news to share : I'm grieving the news that my husband , < PROPMALE > , has been diagnosed with advanced stage IV colon cancer . He has an inoperable tumor in his colon . It seems that the liver is very involved too . We are going in for radiation treatments on the colon tumor every day this week and will see another oncologist on Thursday for more information on the liver . 
We went to see the medical oncologist on Thurs and they want to do some chemo to slow down the progression of the cancer . They assured us that his side-effects would be minimal compared with the treatment of some of the cancers . Still a little unsure about it all . He is so weak already . His weight is only 124# . ( continued ) 
Happy 21st Birthay , < PROPFEMALE > . Looking forward to celebrating with you !!! Love you , li'l sis . 
68 yrs ago today , the Japanese bombed < PROPFEMALE > Harbor . Tonight , we rewatched the < PROPFEMALE > Harbor documentary that we bought at the Arizona Memorial in < PROPFEMALE > Harbor gift shop two visits ago . Still moving to watch . So thankful that God spared our nation even until now . May He raise up strong , capable , but most of all , Godly leaders in our nation . 
Praise God ! Kenny made it through surgery yesterday . The surgeon attempted to do a colon resection but wasn't able . Instead she gave him a colostomy . He was in quite a bit of pain yesterday , but is feeling better this morning . He'll B getting a blood transfusion today-his counts are a little low . He has a low fever , but the docs aren't too concerned about that . He'll B in the hospital ( Barnes West ) for a few more days . 
After nearly a week , < PROPMALE > is being released from the hospital today . 
Crazy day ... Mom is in the hospital , concerned about her , a nurse is on her way to remove < PROPMALE>'s abdominal staples today , working on a memorial video with < PROPFIRST > for < PROPMALE > Gamel , laundry going-sort of-since the dryer isn't working yet , and we have to leave in two hours for the funeral home visitation . So glad I asked the Lord this morning for His grace and strength today ! 
A/C is still down .... hoping the repairman calls soon ! Heat index was 102 * yesterday . Fans just don't seem to help enough when its that hot . I'm especially concerned about our terminally ill patient who is also suffering through the heat . 
HappySlip ..... \

It's been a long battle with colon cancer for my husband . We are at St. < PROPFEMALE > hospital and we may be witnessing his final hours .... thanks to so many who have been praying . The Lord is our strength . 
Thanks to so many who have prayed for < PROPMALE > and our family . Funeral services to be held this week for my husband . May the Lord give us His strength and peace . 
Funeral over , and now I'm not sure exactly where and how to begin to put our lives back together . Needing the Lord's wisdom and strength . He's not brought us this far to abandon us now . So thankful to have Christ as the Rock in our home . 
What an awesome song .... oh , that more Daddies were singing ( praying ) this . \
