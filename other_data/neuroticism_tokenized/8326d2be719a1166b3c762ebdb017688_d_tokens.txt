Why am I feeling depressed right now ? I have a job interview at BestBuy on Monday and I'm full of food . What's wrong ? 
Dude , world air races are freaking intense . 
Wow . < PROPFEMALE > Vs . Liverpool . < PROPFEMALE > two points within 3 minutes . frightening . 
Job interview tomorrow at Best Buy . Wish me luck ! 
Tonight was fantastic . Got chased around a parking lot on PV by Caitie Bendall with a paddle and fabreeze . Had to fight to get back in my own car for fear of getting paddled . Then she literally had me and < PROPMALE > by the nuts ( < PROPFEMALE > roasted ) . < PROPMALE > being Swiss just watches . Finally get back in the car and drive around and the stop by < PROPMALE > Waggoner's house to drop off Caitie so < PROPFIRST > , < PROPMALE>'s 
girlfriend can take her home . I give < PROPMALE > the paddle for the college room , < PROPMALE > finds all of the bread on his roof . Yes , bread all over his roof . So I come home and me , < PROPMALE > , and < PROPMALE > stand around < PROPMALE>'s car sharing tales of hilarity and laugh from 2 oclock until now . My evening started at 10:45 . I'm so glad I have the friends I do . Well I'll see the world in a few hours . I have a job interview at noon . 
First interviewwent pretty well . I have a follow up with the manager at 2 oclock . Fingers crossed , again . 
Well my day turned to crap fast . Get home from a good interview to find my sister is in jail for burglary . Her and a friend decided to ditch school and go to a friends house who parents called the police . My sister listens to no one . I got my brand new ipod stolen out of my car . My grandma is drunk and beligerant . Does it get worse ? 
Pray for strength for my little brother . He's old enough to start knowing what going on and it's hard to know . Be strong < PROPMALE > . Big brother's not gonna let you go anywhere . 
“If only , if only , ” the woodpecker sighs , “The bark on the trees was as soft as the skies , ” As the wolf waits below , hungry and lonely He cries to the < PROPFEMALE > , “If only , if only . ”

Until I feared I would lose it , I never loved to read . One does not love breathing . -Harper < PROPFIRST > . When someone close to you believes they know it all , how do you reason ? They take a nonpartisan approach to the hole they are digging and you can do nothing but give them a ladder . You can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink . 
Get it through your head little sister , you know not what you have . Listen to your brothers who know what it's like to have it all taken away . We love you . 
Why must I be so tired all the time !? 
Slept pretty much all day . its 630 , do i really want to just go to bed ?

Kids of Calle Mayor . Look who I found . < PROPFIRST > R Hignite 
is really starting to feel the lack of interaction with people in my life . Working all day everyday and no girlfriend or anything like that , you just start to feel alone . Not to be a downer . 
Wow , it's rather peaceful not having a cell phone . Sucks I can't call or talk to anyone but oh well . Facebook me if you need me for anything . 
As peacful as it is , theres people I wish I could talk to , it's what makes not having a phone frustrating . 
I've never seen one of these that lasted longer than one question . Let's see if I can do it . I WILL BE COMPLETELY HONEST FOR 24 HOURS ... you can ask me one question ( only in my inbox ) .

Salads are undoubtedly disgusting tasting . 
Being sick sucks . Caugh syrups sucks even more . Not being able to eat a lot at christmas dinner is the worst of all . 
Alex : * puts hand on shoulder * I hate it when you wear Tshirts . Me : Why ? Alex : Because you're too damn big . At least when you wear jackets I can blame it on that . 
Why is it only tuesday ?! 
With the exception of small breaks , and hour here or there , it's literally supposed to rain for a week solid ...... Why must I be stuck at work ? 
2nd storm down , one more to go . Tonights storm is supposed to be the biggun

I'm feeling rather romantic lately . It's ....... refreshing . It's been a long time since I've felt like this . Some “No , this trick won't work ... How on earth are you ever going to explain in terms of chemistry and physics so important a biological phenomenon as first love ? ” - < PROPFIRST > Einstein 
“Very little sleep . It's been on-going , one thing after another . ” - < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > 
“Energy and persistence conquer all things . ” -Big B < PROPFIRST > ( < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > ) 
i cant figure out how to find the phone < PROPFIRST > list on this new facebook setup 
is twistedly ammused by going on Craigslist and just reading all the personal adds and seeing what kind of people are out there . Some of these are rediculous . 
Delays . Delays . Delays . But will be worth it when I'm going through boot with my two compadres . 
Might go bald because I can

IT LIVES ! THE VIPER LIVES ! After years of sitting a collecting dust I finally was able to light a fire under my dad and get him to help me get it running . 
I want ......... something . I'm not sure what it is but I'm frustrated as hell that it's unavailable . I just feel angry , I hate it . 
Can anyoone < PROPFEMALE > me $300 until Monday . Just came up short this week and can hit you back on Monday first thing 
has two things to say : 1 . Is thus far failing at his goal of self betterment . Imagine being on a diet and the food looks you in the eye and TELLS you to eat it . Not so easy to walk away . 2 . Why is it that people who have a lot still find it necessary to complain like they don't . Someone's always out to make their lives miserable it seems and that preposterous so .. suck it up . 
Had a nightmare inside a nightmare last night . I had a dream that I went to the beach yesterday and a kid was taunting me so I chased him , we bonked heads , I got dizzy and kept chasing until I hit something else and then I passed out and I didn't wake up until sunday and missed my snowboarding trip and was totally heartbroken . 
Of course , a wake up rather refreshed , get up , feeling good , have a nice chat with my grandma , everything is on track , I have a feeling I'm about to have my first particularly good day in a while and then ........ I'm late for work -.- 
Found what he wanted . Katalambano . It's good to be back

NEW DOMINOS IS DELICIOUS 
Pray for my sister , she didnt come home tonight night . We don't know what to do . 
1 So shes got a boyfriend , does she have a ring on her finger ? 2 No 1 Then nut up and put that shit on a pedestal . Show her you got what it takes to make her happy 2 Easier said than done 1 It's just as easy to do if you stop being a bitch 2 Alright then , that sounds like a plan 1 Shut the hell up , what are you gonna do ? Put some heart in it ! 2 YEA ! I'm gonna get the girl ! 1 That was gay . Accurate , but gay 2 Sorry 
Yay ! < PROPFEMALE > 28 of 810 of the Microsoft Word 2003 Bible ..... -.- 
It's official . The Marines is going to wait a few years . < PROPMALE > is ...... Going to college first . That is going to feel really wierd to say for a long while . I mean talk about a change in plans ...... but God laughs at our plans . I felt empty and nervous , I found God again . I asked him what to do next and a week later someone offers to pay for my college education . If that's not power prayer the I don't know what is . 
Why is it that all the good girls have boyfriends and those boyfriends happen to be jerk offs . Not to say any girls aren't good but good to me . What ever . You know what I mean .

I really have to learn to log out of my Facebook on other peoples computers . 
Every time stamp on my facebook just changed to \a few seconds ago\ " After I sneezed and grunted incoherently . I think I accidentally found the magic words to take a dimension out of Time turning the Time \ " line\ " into the Time \ " point\ " where all things happen at once and last forever and no time at all . We wouldn't know the difference since we're contained within the Time \ " Line/Point\ " and everything will seem relative . "

So does anyone want a free bike ? It's a nice one . A little old but well kept . It's a Cannondale road bike with the thin tires and all that . It has racing pedals on it which will need to be swapped unless you have the fancy shoes to click onto them and the tired need changing . It has a tire pump strapped onto it so you never go without and an odometer to track your progress ( needs battery ) . 
People need to find a sense of humor . I mean thousand is pretty reasonable considering how far it could go 
Maybe I'm the only one but how annoying is it that every once in a while when you just want to stop everyone else so is set on Go go go ? How long will it take for people to realize that idc if you're upset if I ignore your texts or don't talk to you on any given day . It doesn't bother me if you think I'm a jerk because I say and do ( or don't ) regardless what others think .

Q : A man driving through the woods hit a rabbit . Quickly stopping his car he pours a bottle of liquid over the rabbit . The rabbit jumps up and walks back into the woods waving goodbye all the way . What was in the bottle ? \

Cannot stand all this hub bub about Arizona's act to crack down on immigration status's . It's not unconstitutional . I'm sorry but most illegal immigrants are Mexican seeing as they are coming from \Mexico\ " so there isn't much choice but to check all Spanish or Mexican looking people . "

A poem from when I tried NaPoWriMo :\ 
A seed in the dirt makes a tree in the ground , \ 
The wind blows along to knock the leaves down . \ 
Food for the worms and food for the grass , \ 
The bugs find a home and the birds make a nest . \ 
Then a time comes along when the tree’s dead and gone , \ 
Leaving nothing but seeds to keep carrying on . \ 
A seed in the dirt makes a tree in the ground , \ 
The wind comes along to turn the world around 
almost there . another hour and ive made it through the day staying awake 
What a rediculous night . I've never been more relieved . God bless the PD 
Im oh so very hungry but i hate eating alone .

Anyone know what the Harbor equivalent of Math80 is ?

As I look now into my mirror I'm able to still feel your prescence . You stand beside me , upright and proud , smiling and in good health . The weight of your hand still resting on my shoulder . Though not many words were spoken , we knew a love that was unbreakable . You always brought me gifts from your long trips on the road and I always gave you smiles . I wish I could have given you more . God knows you deserved it . 
Just had the same conversation for the third time with a really nice elderly italian guy who hangs out at Ynot Burger . He always comments on me being a big guy , says i should join the military or police force , says he did 25 years in the military and now all he has to do is twiddle his thumbs . Should get some people and go talk to him one day , listen to his story .

You aren't going to hurt my feelings but I'd like to know . Do you have the stones to tell me ?

AND YOU STILL PUT ICE IN IT ! I can tell the difference .
