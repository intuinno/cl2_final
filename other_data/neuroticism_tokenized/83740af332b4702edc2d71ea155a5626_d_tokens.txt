Munich is as beautiful as ever . Lots of regulations though . I will not be at the computer as of today , because I'll be in Italy . The Internet Cafe we use down there is in Massa Lubrense . We'll go hook up there every so often ... 

Hi < PROPFEMALE > ! How R U ? 
Great ! Am workin ' on a commission . Wanna see ? 
Hi there pretty girl ! Gotta get ready for work .... but first I'm gonna paint a little . 
AWWWWW ! How fun ! \ 
I wish I had someone to run/train with . I'm no expert , but this is how I'd do it . \ 
Week one every 2nd day : walk/run for 1 mile . ( Walk 2 < PROPFEMALE > . run 1)\ 
Week two : gradually run more , walk less , go 2 < PROPMALE > \ 
Week three : run the whole 2 < PROPMALE > , add mileage if you want to . \ 
Keep adding milage . Find your rhythm ( breathing in enough oxygen that you are using up ) without getting winded .
