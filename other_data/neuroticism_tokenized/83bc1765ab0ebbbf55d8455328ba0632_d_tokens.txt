wonders why old people tap you on the shoulder at weddings or births to tell you \you're next ! \ " How'd they feel if we did that to them at funerals ?! " 
working everyday this week except wed and friday !! lets make some plans :) 
Ever fight is a food fight when your a cannibal 
\Every\ " fight is a food fight when your a cannibal "

Time for bed work @ 10 .. final thought : Chinese Proverb- crowded elevator smell different to midget :) 
Man who live in glass house should change clothes in basement 
going to bed soon work @ 8 
somebody like scraped the front right fender of my car ~ im < PROPFEMALE > pissed right now ... need me a sharper the color of my car like in the commercial ... 
so i hate when i lose my phone and get the bright idea to just call it ,... only to remember i have it on vibrate 
watching the fast and the furious with john&jason eating the brownies i just made <3<3 
What cruel bugger spelt \lisp\ " with an \ " S \"??" 
whats the first thing that pops into your head when someone says skittles ? 
kinda tired just spent ALL day at foodlion ~ 10-6 ... feeling blah 
well .... today is unfolding to be interesting 
Okay , next time your in a elevator with a group of people , Open up your bag or purse and whisper , \Do you have enough air in there ? \ " =D " 
If I had a world of my own , everything would be nonsense . Nothing would be what it is , because everything would be what it isn't . <3 
< PROPFEMALE > sens commun n'est pas si commun .. Voltaire

Nobody ever pays me in gum ... 
going to Japan with < PROPFIRST > !! damn guess i need to learn some japanese ~ 
I really thought that saying goodbye would destroy me , but maybe holding on for so long is what hurt me the most .. you were stuck in the past and i needed you to grow up . your silence when i left told me how that would never happen 
damn ! i hate a flaky friend 
supposed to be going to the movies but someone wont answer her PHONE !! 
I <3 creativity 
you say that you love me and that you want my forgiveness .. but its not the same thing if you only love the idea of me . i think that we need a face to face conversation , maybe that way youll stop trying to lie to me 
who would like to ride in a viking ship and pillage walmart with me and < PROPFEMALE > ?? must bring own axes etc 
all cannot be forgiven with an \i love you\ " .. how could i take you back if i cant even trust you ? your lies smother that < PROPMALE > "

This is the sound of a heartbeat\ 
This is the sound of the discontented mouths\ 
Of a haunted nation\ 
We are the voice of breaking down\ 
\

By our own collision\ 
We are the voice of breaking down 
th th th the money is tha motive .. ugh work tomorrow

wondering why you think our problems can be solved by relocation and marriage .. 
A warning to the prophet , the liar , the honest\ 
This is war\ 
Oh , to the leader , the pariah , the victim , the messiah , \ 
Its the moment of truth and the moment to lie\ 
The moment to live and the moment to die\ 
The moment to fight , the moment to fight

Put this as your status if someone you knew was killed by Lord Voldemort or any of his followers . As everybody knows , being killed by a killing curse , having your soul sucked out by a dementor , or getting petrified by a basilisk is a truly tragic fate for anyone ; muggle or wizard . 93% of people won't copy and paste this .... Will you make this your status for at least one hour ?

Post this as your status if you know someone who suffers from being a Duke fan . Being a Duke fan is a real serious disorder and should be taken seriously . There is no known cure and sympathy does not help .. but we can raise awareness . 100% of < PROPFEMALE > fans will re-post this , simply because we KNOW HOW to copy and paste . Go TARHEELS (:

The descent made up of despairs\ 
and without accomplishment\ 
realizes a new awakening :\ 
which is a reversal\ 
of despair\ 
For what we cannot accomplish , \ 
what is denied to love , \ 
what we have lost in the anticipation—\ 
a descent follows , \ 
endless and indestructible .

It is forbidden to kill ; therefore all murderers are punished unless they kill in large < PROPFIRST > and to the sound of trumpets .
