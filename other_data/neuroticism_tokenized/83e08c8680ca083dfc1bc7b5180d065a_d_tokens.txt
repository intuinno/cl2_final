So I was playing with my dog Shakes and she accidently bit my finger so hard she broke it ... 

off to Boulder for a week ! 
Hailstorms ??? I forgot such things existed ! 
Fuck United Airlines . When I buy a ticket to Orange County I don't want to be redirected to Los < PROPFEMALE > after being delayed for over an hour . It's close United , but not the same . What a pain in the ass . At least my drinks were free . 
wishes she was a member of the Oceanic Six . 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > live at the Troubador last night ! <3 <3 <3 She is fucking amazing and perfect and I will punch out anyone who disagrees ! 
< PROPFEMALE > Fawcett died and went to heaven . When she got there God smiled down at her and offered to < PROPMALE > her one wish . She wished for all the children in the world to be safe ... so God killed < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > .... .... too soon ? 
They say bad things come in threes . 1 . < PROPMALE > McMahon 2 . < PROPFEMALE > Fawcett 3 . < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ... Leave it to < PROPFIRST > Mays to throw one in for free ! 
< PROPMALE > is here and the wedding is tomorrow ! How exciting !! <3 
is sad that it's time for < PROPMALE > to leave . 
My car got a make-over today ! 
I feel like apricots are severly overlooked as far as tasty fruits go ... they're de-lish ! 
Cops are so sexist ! I love being a girl ! 
good morning good morning good morning good morning good morning good morning good morning good morning good morning good morning good morning good morning good morning good morning good morning good morning good morning good morning !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ( i 
breaking a good piece is like losing a good friend . . . :( 
my eye itches 
New shoes ! Thanks < PROPFIRST > ! 
HOORAY for < PROPMALE > being here ! 
is about to watch The Haunting in Connecticut with < PROPMALE > . 
There is a possibility that I will be arrested today ... People need to make a stand for what they believe in and if I get tossed in the slammer ... well ... so be it . 
Take note , Boulder County , of the new crosswalk on 13th street . Get your heads on straight and make it permanent . 
CASA < PROPFEMALE > !!!!!! 
VEGAS OR BUST BABY !!!! Seeing Peepshow tonight at Planet Hollywood .... Damn I love Vegas !!! 
has discovered that making wishes in fountains can be hazardous for those around her ... 
What Would < PROPMALE > Botwin Do ? 
has decided it is time for a new < PROPMALE > project . 
just becuase you call me for a ride , doesn't make any less of a walk of shame . 
Everyone needs to go out and see Inglorious Basterds , and multiple times at that ! 
off to in-n-out for last last time until christmas .... * sigh * 
Off to Honolulu ... 
I have a new pet ! His name is Kowabunga . 
my fish is a very happy fish 
classy in a naked kind of way ... 
Do priests become pedophiles or do pedophiles become priests ? 
grilled cheese , tomato soup , and a diet coke . . . what more could a girl ask for ? :) 
Not only do I have a happy fish , I have several happy fish . There are the Seven Dwarfs ( neon tetra ) , Mopsy , Flopsy , and Cottontail ( guppies ) , Thing 1 and Thing 2 ( little orange jobs ) , and Kowabunga ( purple beta ) . In addition to that I have three snails : Speedy Gonzales , and < PROPFEMALE > and the Brain . I am a woman of many fish . 
The most interesting thing happened ... I bought fish , ( like I said I am a woman of many fish ) seven of them being neon tetra . There are only four of them in the tank ... I know the other fish didn't eat them because they aren't aggressive ... WHERE ARE MY FISH ?? 
School starts today !!!!!!! 
Three more of the Seven Dwarfs are dead ... I suppose I'll have to change the name seeing as there is only one left . I think I'll call him Jurassic Park . That being said , how am I supposed to take care of myself when I can't even keep fish alive ? 
I made it through the first week of school and I didn't die . I would say I'm off to a good start . 
I hope Kanye West isn't at < PROPFIRST > Swayze's funeral ... You can get back to mourning in a minute , but < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > had the best death of the year ! ... too soon ? 
So I gave in and read Twilight . I hate to admit it , but I am converted . 
strippers and jager-bombs ... what a night ! 
Less than two weeks until I'm in California ! 
I leave for California in one week !!! YYYYYAAAAAYYYYY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
I saw Dog The Bounty < PROPMALE > outside my apartment the other day ! Finally after two years in Honolulu my dream came true . His big blonde mullet is even more beautiful in person !! 
I asked directions from a < PROPFEMALE > in a bottle of Vodka and she lied to me . Oh well . Might as well polish the bottle . 
Fuck it . I'm seeing Inglorious Basterds again . 
I hope the Cardinals stomp the Dodgers . 
One day I will find the Shrek to my < PROPFEMALE > . 
is making a cheesecake . 
I can't even begin to describe the utterly fantastic mood I am in . The best part of it is , I'm not even being sarcastic ! 
I'm leaving for California tomorrow ! 
I'm leaving for California TODAY !!!!! 
RIP Kowabunga ... your suicide was a shock to me ... 
capitalism 
Too much input , not enough output . 
Just picked up the new < PROPMALE > Palahniuk book today ! I hope it isn't disappointing ... 
... and turn right back around and head back to Honolulu . Back to the classes , and tests , and the unending cyclical minute routine that distracts from the violent reality that is Life . 
And yet again I feel myself being let down . < PROPMALE > Palahniuk , oh how you disgrace yourself . Your decline began with Diary and took a turn for the worst with Haunted . I thought perhaps you were going to make a recovery with Rant , but I see my hopes amount to nothing . Snuff offered little improvement , but Pygmy is a sure sign that your writing abilities have died . 
I am Mikhela's complete lack of surprise . 
is sick sick sick of fucking drama 
STATISTICS WAS CANCELLED ! PRAISE THE LORD ! can i get an AMEN brother !!!!!!! 
Revolutionary Road is a depressing and uncomfortable movie . 
off to the gym . 
Worte a great paper for psych ... but now I'm off to bomb a history test ... 
nervous breakdown in 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... go ! 
Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries ! Now go away or I shall taunt you a second time ! 
Off to the < PROPMALE > museum ! <3 
Looking at prices for tickets to Japan !!! I am so excited to go next spring ! 
The Saw movies inspire me to be a better person . 
I miss the snow of Colorado . 
HALLOWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN !!!! 
I saw a slutty nun and a slutty Jesus tonight ... my life is basically complete ! I love Halloween ! 
I hate how we go right from Halloween to Xmas ... what happened to Thanksgiving ? 
Although in general I would consider myself a peaceful person who does not support war or political assasination , I am willing to change my stance for Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . 
wishes < PROPMALE > would come home . 
My debate team won by a LANDSLIDE and I was voted second best debater ! 
Is really REALLY looking forward to my 10 day California vacation for Thanksgiving . Thank God ! I need to see my dogs ! 
Music is the only thing that makes sense anymore ... 
I leave for California in one week ! 
My stats class makes me want to shake a baby ! 
going to the gym ... 
I'M BACK ! 
going to see New < PROPFEMALE > right now ! I'm too excited for words ! <3 
Quiche and French Onion Soup for dinner ... I hope it tastes good ! 
Sometimes when I drive I can't help but think of the Autopia cars at Disneyland ... 
2012 was actually a pretty good movie ... 
GET YOUR TURKEY ON ! 
Thanksgiving has nothing to do with the Native Americans breaking bread with us back in the day . It was turned into a national holiday during the Civil War by Honest < PROPMALE > in an attempt to unite a country in the throws of a vicious war . 
I had a blast at the shooting range ! 
Going back to Hawaii tomorrow ! 
the semester is almost over ... thank God ! 
The movie Brothers is very depressing . 
textbook buy-back is my favorite part of any semester ... 
Textbook Buy Back was not as profitable as I had hoped . $19.75 for $200 worth of books ? Seriously ? Fuck off HPU ! 
I'm swimming in a river of fatigue and pain . Finals are going to be the death of me . For those of you who have finished finals : fuck off . <3 
Two down three to go ! 
So I'm finsihed with finals ! Better than that my Humanities paper was chosen to be sent to the board as an example of super fucking amazing work ! It was supposed to be anonymous but I can't keep it quit because I am the shit !!!!!!!!!! <3 
Peace Out Hawaii ! 
thank you all so much for the birthday wishes <3 
I'm sad about < PROPFEMALE > Murphy ! 
Red wine and frozen pizza ... we are the very definition of class ! 
I wish my school would post grades already ! 
< PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > is one of the best movies ever . 
I got a 3.05 last semester ! 
Black Lace ! 
If you plan on seeing Youth in Revolt save your money and read the book . 
Off to Laughlin , NV ! I hope I win $ 50,000 ! 
The Lovely Bones was great but bring tissues ! 
rain rain go away ... 
it's raining in my living room ! 
In the wild there is no < PROPMALE > care . In the wild health care is \Ow ! I hurt my leg I can't run ... \ " A lion eats me . I'm dead . " 
As the rain falls from my ceiling into the pots on the floor it makes a different sound depending on the size of the pot ... it almost sounds like music ... shitty roof leaking expensive repair music ... 
< PROPMALE > lost more weight with Subway than my total weight ... and now he's fat again ... i don't feel that bad lol ! 
I am a genius ! 
R . I . P JD Salinger 
going to see < PROPFIRST > Mraz tonight ! 
I hate my Spanish teacher more than last semesters Statistics teacher .... 
Everything I've been waiting for is coming tonight . The questions have tortured my mind for years causing me to lose countless hours of sleep , driving me deeper into the depths of insanity . Hopefully this will bring about a sense of understanding . The final season of Lost starts tonight ! I'm so excited ! 
So ... My phone screen broke today and I got texts from people and couldn't check them ! If you texted me today and I didn't answer I'm sorry !!!

i No me gusta estudiar español ! 
I'm so excited to see < PROPFIRST > McCartney on 3/31 at the Hollywood Bowl !!!

Venti non-fat chai with 2 add shots ... GOOD MORNING WORLD !

Koko is getting married tomorrow !!!! 
Note to < PROPFIRST > Cera : ENOUGH ALREADY !!! 
I like Science . 
I understand that the dogs love me but do I really need company in the bathroom ??? 
Going to see Dinner for Shmucks tonight ! 
I hate all the stupid \ So and So likes .... \ " who fucking cares what you like . I don't . You must have no life if you spend all your time writing and liking \ " i likes\ " . I like people who have lives . " 
School starts tomorrow ! 
First day of school was fine ... now for day 2 ! 
For those of you who still don't know ... I'm not coming back to Hawai'i ... There was no good way to tell you . Most of you I will miss , some of you I won't and you all know who you are ! <3 
You can now buy my homemade fudge at < PROPMALE > Bloom's Cafe Noir ! 
I think my childhood home is going to burn down . The mountains of Boulder are on fire and my house is right at the fucking middle of it ... it doesn't look good ... 
The final word came in .... my house burned to the ground . nothing left but the chimney . 
So I'm watching a re-run of the VMA'a and just saw < PROPFIRST > Bieber sing \Baby\ " or whatever it's called ... that was when I first realized that wasn't a girl singing ... " 
Making tacos for dinner ! 
So I had a quick layover in Vegas on my way back from Colorado this morning and I won $100 on a fucking airport < PROPFEMALE > slot !!!!!!!!

Why is it that whenever I try to write a paper I always end up on facebook ... 
Go rear ended on the way to school yesterday and my head hurts ... fuck people who don't know how to drive .
