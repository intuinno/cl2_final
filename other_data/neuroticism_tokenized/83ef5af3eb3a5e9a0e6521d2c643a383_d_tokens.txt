HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY ! And so the legend goes that : Once upon a time , a man by the name of < PROPFIRST > became a Saint through his < PROPMALE > actions in advocacy for love . For love is the only unexplainable , intangible concept left that man cannot form a concrete lie to define . For this fact , < PROPFIRST>'s Day has the greatest meaning of all holidays . I love that my country celebrates it although it's heavily commercialized . 
For those of u who know : I am officially done with < PROPFIRST > Niwiki . I JUST got am e-mail telling me that ' no futher action will be taken . ' She must have been trying to get me for months ! =[ 
So my rommate just gave me pepperspray . Never touched pepperspray before in my life ! I got carried away and sprayed the air like it was air freshener ! We were both wheezing for an hour ! =[ I'm dumb . 
So one of my new roommates is my ex boyfriend's current girlfriend . * awkward * But I'm already lovin ' her ! She speaks Japanese and I just so happen to be taking classes and learning it this Summer ! I'm determined to be bilingual ! 
My alarm failed me this morning . =[ But I woke up to the sound of my new roommate randomly VACUUMING ! - Oh yeah , I'm going to enjoy this quarter ! I get clean roommates ! 
Had Dim Sum ( AUTHENTIC traditional chinese cuisine served only at breakfast time ) yesterday with InterVarisity and my Lover ! I love cultural meals . . . and I love being an Anthropology < PROPMALE > ! 
JUST GOT A HUUUUUUGE PAYCHECK ( 3 paychecks actually ) . I'm going to the Chinese market and buying 4 different kinds of Roasted Duck ! It's my fav ! 
Being a scholar looks messy !
