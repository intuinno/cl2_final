I'm not sure if this NON-drowsy clariton is so . 
\I . Am . Holding . You ! \"" 
So today I wrote 2 sentences on one of the 11 papers that are due near the end of the month . Mission accomplished ?

Just took the last English test ! Hopefully the last forever ! 
Yep , so 15 hours for that 10 pager ...

\Sperm are like a box of chocolate ; you never know what you're going to get . \ " . - Way to go Dr. Loui . Way to go . " 
I think I just wrote a guitar part to the chorus of a song ?... 
Dancing in old , loose flip flops can be a slicky situation ! 
Thinks that you should get off facebook and go outside . 
What do ya know , my body soap has magically reappeared in the shower . 
I seem to have lost my Bloch Suite , and I'm not cool with that . 
Perkinston phone service may just be losing me a night at the club ... 
All of these people can not be studying for their finals ... really 
I know I should really be getting down with sociology , but I can't help thinking \36 hours and I'll probably be out of perk ! \"" 
Fun counts on the middle letter if the word

It's too bad that < PROPFEMALE > Marling will never be played on common radio ... She has too much substance for it . 
\I can't give up that quick . \ 
\if your bread is stale make toast \"" 
10 toes and counting ... 
HAH ! Dad just hit a CMRC mailbox ! 
Stop pacin , time wastin . \ 
Got a friend with a pole in the basement . 
WTH ?! A peacock on highway 15 ?!? 
Wow , just found out what jello really is . 
So I just beat Okami ... Again . And I still believe it to be one of the best ever . Mega props Clover ! 
Note to readers : < PROPFIRST > is not handy around the household . Remember it . 
Can't wait for Sia's new album ! ... yes , even if it's a pop record . 
Injured my back while doin the flava ... Yes . Yes , I feel lame . 
Well , I guess \Touchdown Jesus\ " didn't save that chick .... A grim humor indeed . " 
Looking for evil DF , feeling apprehensive . Mental battle with evil DF ... or overcoming her manipulative ... ness .... Lose . Group reform of < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , and self . Evil DF comes after us . Landry comes back in spirit form ... ( I guess she didn't make it ) . However , afterlife apparently improves mental prowess , and we somehow know that Landers can defeat her . Wake up . \ 
\ 
Now interpret THAT ! 
-Time Shift- Ended up at a huge museum with < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , Landry , Evil < PROPFEMALE > Fanning shape shifter person , and some aggressive chick with a bow and arrow . Not sure why we were there , maybe stealing something . Group separates . 
. )- Suddenly a thieves guild drives up in 3 large black pickup trucks and semi-kidnaps the 2 of us . Oh crap ... A couple I met at perk are in the truck with me . I question them to make sure that they are who they say . They pass my vague questioning . They're on their way to some sort of thieving gig . 
Pin DF to ground , call 911 . 911 operator laughs at me ... Reprimand 911 operator ... She says that officers would take 2 minutes if I still wanted them to come . -(I'm pinning an evil < PROPFEMALE > Fanning to the ground ... of course I want them to come 
. Found Gramps in his car , went back to the house , had a great conversation . Wondered why I haven't seen him in so long . Realized he died . Wondered who I had been having a conversation with and had been posing as my grandfather . Readied Rain stick for defensive action . Gramps transforms into an evil < PROPFEMALE > Fanning look-alike . 
Swam to < PROPFIRST > , MS to back of what was Gramps's house . Found out that 2 of the man-seals were a couple . Saw a mysterious person run off toward the front of the house . Entered house , realized that the front door was barricaded by a chest/trunk , so found a rain stick to defend myself before pulling away the trunk 
Ok , Weird Dream Award ! The short version :\ 
\ 
Rode a snow crab boat until it hit something . Swam with killer whales , dolphins , and men with seal-end mermen suits , but couldn't see them very well b/c it was the gulf coast and the water is nasty - as usual- ( but oil free ) . 
On my way to LA ! Yaaaaayyyyy ! 
< PROPMALE > should have taken a picture of the little squid in that noodle dish before I ate it ... It was actually kind of cute-ish . Anyways , Rock Sugar is the bomb ! 
At the KCRW World Fest ! Huzzah ! 
Omg , these world hippees are taking hits in my vicinity ! I didn't know the world music crowd parties like this ! 
I should probably cross off shimmying from my current job possibilities list . Not great at it . But not horrble either . ^__ ~ 
It's amazing that you can know so little about some and yet care so deeply for them . 
OMG Noooo ! The air went out on our road trip ! /deathwail 
Do we create love or channel it ? 
Yet another proof of a slight messiah complex after disecting yet another apocalyptic dream the other night . 
Remember Me was actually pretty darn good ... The characters were great and they seem like they'd be extra fun and challenging to play . 
New Azure < PROPFIRST > out September 14th on Saddle Creek !!!!!!!!! \ 
\ 
Last day of the tour is on Sat Nov 20th in B'ham! I'm there ! Who's with me ?!?!?!?! 
Anybody wanna < PROPFEMALE > ? I'm free tonight ... Just singing Eisley . 
Could spit out a romance novel this tonight ! Peace and Love to people ! 
Do you change ? Do you hide your spiritual adaptation ? Or are you just as stagnant as your facade ? 
Wish I was a bit more deft with the intuition ... Trying to find a legit reiki master so I can attune to level 1 . 
Hahaha ... \Aren't you tired of praying for a better God ? \"" 
Well , The Windup Bird Chronicle read really well , but it was kindof bad . 
Dear IHL ... Please contact me soon . \ 
K , thanks .

-it was perfect . Not all parts of it were simple , fun , easy , or beautiful , but I accept it . And I accept that part of myself for it . - 
I can't force you to think . I can't even force you to feel ! But even if I could , I don't know if I ' d want to . Because it's your experience . Because it wouldn't be the same . 
It is better to live your own < PROPFEMALE > imperfectly than to live an imitation of somebody else's life with perfection . --- The Bhagavad < PROPFEMALE >

So paradise literally means ' walled garden ' . Well that's a new one . 
Spirit is sooo funny sometimes ! 
Can't wait to play with some energies ! Who wants to be my long distance reiki guinea pig ? 
Omg , I think I just saw a racist air national guard commercial . And I'm not kidding . 
Wow , that's a really bad mattress . 
I'm so proud of all the SYTYD dancers !!! And a special congrats to < PROPFIRST > ! What am I going to be creatively inspired by next ? 
Wow , so I just heard something , and it may or may not be true , but Americans could supposedly spend 10billion to eliminate world illiteracy ... And that is supposedly half of the amount that we spend on ice cream in a year . 
I love it when you semi-trip and then you look down at your foot like there's something wrong with your shoe , but in reality you just spazzed out . 
/sigh ... Life ... People 
Think I just went totally over Mom's head explaining eastern/new age principles . 
In Hattiesburg ! But the clubhouse is empty !? 
It's too dang hot to be roaming around campus ... :( 
\Haikus are easy\ 
Oh my God , I realized today that I'm finally happy , and for so many reasons too . 
My economics book has explained opportunity costs by telling me that I chose to read this chapter instead of watching tv , email , napping , eating , novel reading , and shopping .... That's so wrong . 
Way to go Case , you just got misted with gasoline . 
Well , that was an epic fail . 
Ok , ok , I'll admit it . < PROPFEMALE > and the Machine is my new music squeeze .

You don't have problems . You're just bored . 
Dang ... I forgot to eat today . 
Just contacted my master(Jerome ) for the next kundalini reiki attunement ! Time to turn up the heat ! 
I believe that now is an entirely appropriate time for a big-eyed , bird-nosed smiley . \ 
87 ) 
Well now im just confused . But I digress . \ 
I wonder what would happen if I went up to the starbucks bar/barstool . Would the consumer-Barista dynamic change ? Would they become something like my therapist/bartender ? Or would I be the one to bear the woes of these tired workers with aching feet who smell of coffee grinds . We could just bend the fabric of space and time here . \ 
^__ ~ 
Ok , I'm considering a name change . Seriously . I'm thinking about < PROPFIRST > Flat ... So I can keep up the shorthand music thing . Db 
Seriously , I'm downright giddy . \ 
: ) . ^__^ ! __ ! 87 ) 
Just chillaxin , listening to the new azure < PROPFIRST > album ... Thankyou Saddle Creek . ^__^ 
Can't a state of confusion apply when I don't have as much work to do ? 
Starbucks music seems to vary between being very good and sort of sucking ... I just heard < PROPFEMALE > Marling song : ) 
Well , some drunk chick thinks I'm pretty , and she would go back to men for me . Lol 
For a second there , I thought that my brain might fall off from overuse . I then remembered that it isn't a limb , is encaged , and therefore , can not fall off . \ 
Anyways , Celtic Fest starts tomorrow . 
Dear All That Is , \ 
You are Me and All Others . \ 
I am very single . Very . \ 
Please fix this . \ 
Or just my recent uncharacteristic problem with it . \ 
Thanks in advance . \ 
Peace . 
If I take a step higher and you need pulling up , the distance between us will be as nothing . 
I'm availble for the hanging of it out tonight . 
Sure would be convenient if people had signs over their heads ... \Ascension conciously in process \"." 
I'm really thinking that these three massive mirrors are in my path for a reason . 
I got a speeding ticket tonight ... Yay ? 
I asked for a break and I got it . Score . 
Writing , intending . \ 
Fading lights , flashing sirens . \ 
Might just sleep to wake . 
Writing down my intentions has made me realize how many cool things I want to do with my life and others . Not to mention I feel sortof guru-saintish . I'm sort of suprised at how many things I've been meaning to keep up . 
So NCLB still blows ... Thus public < PROPMALE > mostly does too ... Teachers need freedom from bizzaro regulations to actually do something useful . Your thoughts ? 
I like the idea of saying disolving weight/fat instead of losing it . If you lose it you might find it again . 
So today feels pretty freaking amazing . 
My guitar is fixed ! Can I get an amen ?! 
Here's the deal ... You ask , I tell . You don't , I don't , and we move on with our lives . 
How freaking hard is it to find a black square plate ?!?! 
South City Radio @ 10pm Friday night on 88.5 . 
Dear Geosystems book , \ 
Where dis you go ? \ 
You could have at least left a note . 
Feeling a bit zombiesque this today . 
Ok , so < PROPFEMALE > Grandin is pretty good . 
How are people keeping their TOMs smelling bearable ?... Cause mine are smelling kindof funky . 
I just found out that a kick of adrenaline , from fear or whatever , can negate the effects of marujuana . So a panicy situation can knock the high to get to safety . 
Finally figured out how to get this live sound DVD to actually work on my laptop ... Ok ... Just the night before the test . Whatever . 
So unless everybody else bombed and there is an AMAZING curve , I totally just failed my Live Production midterm . 
Haaving trouble deciding . 
' Talk ' is a funny word . It doesn't really seem to fit with it's meaning . 
Woah ! Something about today has me going into a meditative state at the drop of a hat ! 
How can one be separate yet part of one as a whole ? What makes the cell of a fingernail different than the cells flowing through veins ? In bone ? In nerve ? What of the strong muscle in heart ? Some are born quickly and die swiftly . Some stay til departure . They're the same at core , but what is it that alters them for their own purposes and experiences ? I'll ponder on . 
Wonder if I'll forge an addiction to nicotine if I < PROPFEMALE > too much around the smokers haven behind the liberal arts building . 
So I'm engaged ... Who wants to come to the wedding ? 
So I am in love ... With this organization . \

Learning the Gayatri Mantra . 
If I had been who am now two years ago , I would have seriously considered MUM . 
These seven fellows DID NOT die to be martyrs . Why would somebody use their deaths in that way ? I guess what I'm really saying is that I'd rather present all the people that pulled through difficulties with grace and stature to honor them . 
Yeah , that play wasn't intense at all . 
This humidity is making me feel aquatic ! 
I love bad weather ... Really : ) 
< PROPFEMALE > Marling can be my mad musical genius whenever she wants . : ) 
I wonder how close the questions , \Do you believe in God ? \ " and \ " Do you believe in man ? \ " are to each other . " 
My critical analysis on Thank You for Smoking filler : random tobacco facts if course ! 
My sky horoscope for this week is hilarious . Something about wanting to drown someone in soup . 
Dear Bossalino , \ 
Why is it that I taste their embers\ 
More than smell them ? \ 
How can I see them dancing wildly\ 
But know they have rhythm ? \ 
Are your waves curing , crashing , \ 
Causing breath more deeply ? \ 
Dear Bossalino , \ 
Tie wick together . \ 
Reach out to hold me . \ 
Sing they'll burn :\ 
As one , \ 
Through one , \ 
Wholly . \ 
But I can only dance on your time , \

Just waiting , for now , watching , \

Balance being social , witty , interesting , energetic , calm , open , truthful , healing , moving , intellectually engaged , relaxed .... Right , gotcha .... \ 
Oh shnitzel . 
If I actually knew anything useful that I could do with a religion < PROPMALE > , I'd totally go for it . 
It's likely that the only thing I'll be able to repeat today from economics is that the late Keynes was bisexual . 
Thinking about doing the 9week ruminski reiki method course . The Usui flavor . 
Is happy to be a part of @ < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > ' s fantasy of sitting in the grass ... on a towel . 
Is tired of Jesus emails . 
Azure < PROPFIRST > show on Sat 20th ! Birmingham , 18+ . I'm getting a room there , that night . Tell me if you want to come with ! 
< PROPFEMALE > the Great is cracking me up ! 
\You and me are still 
On another note : I don't remember where I parked . Haha , I'm such an old man . 
So my goofy challenge for you is to listen to the S Club 7 greatest hits samples on iTunes/amazon , and then tell me how many of the songs you recognize . I used to watch the show ! 
So on the dating preferences list , I should just sum it up and ask for another me . Because I pretty much like me . 
\the time's already gone 
I think I've just been lucid dreaming ... Score ! 
So are there American Africans ? 
Is ripping his new < PROPFEMALE > the Great CD ! :) 
My human design chart is strangely similar to Mozart's ... Interesante . 
That was too great . It was literally perfect . Azure < PROPFIRST > .... Really ... Wow ... 20 times better live .... I mean ... I'm having trouble speaking . The vibrations through my vocal chords aren't as sweet . I mean , I saw people crying .... Grown men too ... Great . 
Ok , I'm officially playing QUESTION ! Inbox me and I'll do my best to answer them via wall post while you remain anonymous to other readers ! Don't get too stupid though . 
Q : What was your wildest night , or what you consider it to be ? (sortof rephrased)\ 
A : Not so wild , but there was a night that I jumped out of a car and chased a dog down the street .... In slow motion supposedly . I'll have to think more on this one . 
Wikileaks huh ? It's revolutionary I'd say . 
I know there's a wall of glass between us , but who's in the cage ? 
Wth is with so many people staring at me when I go to a Marsh recital ? 
I'm starting to wonder if rumination was always my bestie . 
I feel beat . Just woke up from one if those dream chains you can't seem to shake . In one part , I know I was Jewish , and had been captured along with others by the middle eastern version of Nazis . 
Roots reunion live tonight at http://www.usm.edu/wusm ! 
I know what love is in its piece , and I don't think it can be defined except by the word and its translations . 
Now's the time to lol at Dad's Bimbo Bread ! 
I'm still playing question , if you're interested . 
If I would just freaking reiki myself at the start of the day , things would look a whole lot more chipper . 
Loving the singoff recordings ! Get Landslide off iTunes ! 
Just want to give a bit Congrats to < PROPFEMALE > Palin on her big win of the \Most Annoying Person of the Year\ " award ! Way to go boo ! " 
Dad : \I'm not gonna put my head on no bread ! What am I ; a heathen ?! \ " . Lol " 
So Happy Christmas ... I guess . ; ) 
What the heck ?! Dad asked for and received a double sided axe !?!? 
We're in limbo . Escrow . You know ? 
\Facepression- the sadness felt after reading your loved ones ' dull status updates . \"" 
is feeling glum because his sistas from < PROPFIRST > mistas , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > and Landry McMillan , are back in Starkville . : _ ; 
Just finished Wolf's Rain again . Woah , it's been a journey . If that's not emotional , I don't know what is . 
There's a still ocean beneath the surface in need of a < PROPFEMALE > to turn the tide . 
Yeah , so I found out Starbucks had a mermaid on it's icon ... I just thought it was a woman . It's not like her tail was showing . For all we knew , she could have been a centaur . She might not have even been a woman . @_@ 
Where'd my fb videos go ? Anybody know how to get to them ? \ 
On another note : If you're doing a video blog , you should wear a shirt . 
Well , I found my videos ... and I also discovered that I'm down to 6ish photo albums from 30something ... As in , all but one of my trip albums from overseas , and an ' 08 graduation/field day album . I'm REALLY upset right now , but I can't quite verbally express it yet . 
http://www.reiki.org/reikinews/reikin24.html\ 
Some reiki research . 
It's kinda hot in the apt ! O_o 
I've really gotta clep algebra ... Because there's no way that I'm going to class for an 1:15 in addition to 3 hours in the lab a week ... For a freaking 3G credit course . 
Anybody have a < PROPMALE > I can borrow til I can my own ? I need it for class ! 
Either this translation sucks , or Freud talks in circles . 
Thinking about totally changing my schedule . Dropping Theories of religious experience for festival production , and swapping my mwf rock appreciation to a wed . Night world appreciation . 
So festival production doesn't exist . It's live production business .... And it's full , so I'm working on it . 
My 11:11 s are becoming more frequent again . 
\Does your heart < PROPFEMALE > like a hall ? Cause there's no one there at all . \ " The Weepies " 
Thanks for the b day wishes ! 
Super great mood today ! Must be the aquarian < PROPFEMALE > ! And I want to write a song about Sigmund Freud ... Heh . 
Big thanks to Rev Newman and < PROPMALE > Force for the career insight ! And Sun , < PROPFEMALE > , and Mars in 13degrees Aquarius ! 0_0 ! 
Crap , that cello recital makes me miss < PROPFEMALE > . 
LOVE the cold weather ! 
The McGurk effect . Pretty awesome ! 
Do I really want to sleep for 2 hours ? 2 
Last fm is starting to charge for mobile access ... Hissssss 
So energy healers emit the same frequency as medical devices used for bone growth . Interesante . \

I'm officially a beast at Photoshop lassoing . 
Of course the comcast people come the day I can sleep late . 
Temps in the 70s . /cringe 
Humming clears the brain of toxic particles . Interesante . 
And birds chirp at about 5000hz in the morning , which is a frequency that has helped corn crops . Crickets chirp at around 2000hz , which kind of shuts everything down to rest . 
Please finish my media prod project for me .... : _ ; 
I feel so clear and productive today 
I swear I've never seen these people in this class before . 
Cut two new ringtones tonight . Productivity : ) 
---- skip --- \ 
I went back to the woman . And waited after some girl who had problems took her time ... Walked through a museum (?) to get to the secret passage way where the woman gives most of her readings . She starts to read for me and asks if I \ever stopped to think that you're becoming addicted to this ? \ " . She pulls some cards and then ... My alarm went off . \ 
It never came , and I ended up eating several pieces . ( I can totally get the symbolism behind this ) . Another thing to note is the sweet potato dessert , which would have been healthier , but I don't much care for it , so I didn't really eat it , even though I'm sure it would've been better than the former . 
I understood every symbol in some way . And even though she picked them , its more like I did . ---- time lapse\ 
At some point I was eating a cream cheese pastry thing in a large casserole dish , but it wasn't very good . Some black pepper had been spilled all over it . Actually it was horrible , but I kept eating it , hoping for that perfect bite with all it's original sweetness . 
I realize that this little red rocket album is like cheap 90s rock/pop , but I'm kindof enjoying blasting it with my windows down . 
I love how my fb advertisements include a book about the childless by choice . What can I say ? I don't want kids . I just have no clue how it figured that out from my info . 
I feel slightly confused . 
Peace comes in waves when you least expect it . 
I've missed you Untold Stories of the ER . 
Ok , how is it easier for /somebody/ to restack trash that has fallen over than tossing it in a trash bag , where it should be . This is what happens when I leave for the weekend . 
Love that there's a cougar music station on yahoo radio . 
I'd like to try playing tennis with a skillet . Non-stick of course . 
Caffeine's the bomb diggity . 
Thank you notes :\ 
Thank you , \ 
Woman on Kroger commercial ,... for making us wonder what happens in Kroger because you had to pick your pants up at the door . \ 
CBS radio public service announcements ,... for giving the steps of proper chainsaw usage . \ 
Lifetime channel ,... for surfacing my formerly unconscious link of the military and country music . 
Thank you again , \ 
Kroger .... for making another risqué commercial focusing on entirely on your meat . You have raised our curiosity even more so . 
< PROPFIRST>'s playing in b'ham on April 9 , but I'm not sure if I'll go , as she's not headlining . 
Stumbleupon just found me a website to live rent free while traveling around the world for only $30annual membership ! 
Ok , I know I'm really late on this , but I just found out that a set of Mormons spent $20 million to fight same sex marriage in CA . What ?!?! They could try using that money for something actually helpful , like ... I don't know , FEEDING the HUNGRY , or just maybe PROVIDING DRINKABLE WATER ... Seems kind of wasteful guys . 
I just found out what TLC ( the network ) stands for : The Learning Channel . What exactly arena learning ? Birth control costs a lot less than 18 kids . 
Eisley had a new album released on the 1st ?! Whaaaat ?! 
Tinariwen has surfaced the belly dancer locked deep within my core @_@ . 
Well , the loose caboose is still dull . 
I think my alarms being screwy is a good enough sign to skip my least likable class . 
Did my Ruminski Reiki method masters attunement yesterday . Yay ! I know it sounds bizarre , but my hands feel bigger . 
Is it weird that I like to hum the note that the Walmart cooler things make when I'm there ? 
I apologize to everybody that received a ____ many people have viewed < PROPFIRST>'s profile ... It totally spammed without my will . 
I think people were surprised when I asked a question about unbalanced cables in audio today . I'm usually just awake enough to listen . It's not like I'm mute , geez . 
\Thank you ... Passive aggression ... I guess . \ " \ 
Hipster alert ! Hipster alert ! Location : Whole Foods ! 
I don't get cards . I mean , the card would have to be insanely specific to the person to be worth anything . Hand written cards are exceptions as they're tailored . Most cards just seem lamely obligatory . 
Am I looking at drawer organizers in Bed Bath Beyond to compensate for something else in life with a lack of haste and organization ? You tell me . Do I feel better ? Yes . 
I've finished my latest Media Prod . project ! It wasn't so bad this time . < PROPFEMALE > Girard read Faust and I layered it with < PROPFIRST > Bird ' s Yawny at the Apocalypse . 
The new eisley album is great just keeps getting better per listen . The Airborne Toxic Event ..... Well ... Ewww . The drums are turned up too loud . 
So my prophesy about that economics class is pretty much true : the only thing I remember from it is that the late Keynes was bisexual . 
Ehh ! As Tall As Lions is breaking up ! ;_; \ 
I shall need consoling for this . 
It's insanely quiet on campus right now . Even the people here are pretty quiet . 
It's out now : Serendipity really isn't skrewing me . It's too bad , really . 
I just want to congratulate Kazuo Ishiguro for being able to use \concertinaed\ " in an interview . Not something I would think of . " 
Really didn't want to see a ton of aborted fetuses this morning ... 
So I found out my paper is supposed to be 2 pages shorter than I thought . Epic win . 
I can admit that I don't know how to use the libary ... I feel awkward ... It's quiet here ... Too quiet . 
Don't know I want to make this world music apprec . paper more specific and go for the hare krnsa movement in relation the the Beatles , or just keep it on Hindu/Sanskrit mantras . Whatcha think ? 
I honestly don't know what kind of courses I'd be taking if I had stayed at perk ... My basics are pretty much done , and I can't say that I've exactly been focusing on them ... Junk electives I guess . A lot of plays . A lot of loitering in parking lots ... Hah . Transfer was a good choice . 
After working on this report for a while , I've come to find that < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > was a pretty cool dude . It's funny that he's the one Beatle whose name I could never remember or associate with anything ... Until now , that is . 
Just a few more hours ! Agh ! I can make it ! 
\PEELING IN THE HEAT\ 
So it looks like Im taking management 300 next semester . Not stoked about that . 
Since when was ' stoked ' my new word ? I need to throw a ' bra ' in there .... or a ' breh ' . 
Does anybody remember those weird ... fake aquarium like things that you put different plastic figures into this gelatinous stuff ? 
Thankyou SOAR ... For not letting me sign up for MGT 300 because I do not have a < PROPMALE > standing ... I will next semester you stupid hoe . 
My Personality has a new option up where you can look at average personality scores of the states + DC . \ 
Guess which was least like mine ?.... I always knew that I had to leave . California , here I come ! They also recommend Switzerland/ The Netherlands for countries . hah ! 
You should really watch Catfish . 
I pulled out the flute for a few hours today .... It was , well ... Yeah ... uh .... \ 
It was . \ 
Guess I shouldn't complain since I practice so little . 
Movie idea ! What Not To Wear : Cup Edition . 
Thinking about going through the news feed and deleting the people from my list that primarily use ghettofied English , which I have to decipher via urban dictionary . 
Storyboarding time ! 
I am not getting fb notifications when other people comment on posts I've made on other walls ...? 
LOVE the weather ! 
Gym time with < PROPFEMALE > Virtue ! Lol . It works for me . 
After seeing several ProTools capabilities , I'm now convinced that aliens exist . 
Omg , I had a dream that I was shot in the head , but I was a different person and I had a wife . 
My ascended masters card deck came in ! Yay ! Inbox me if you want me to pull you one . 
< PROPFEMALE > cosmic being ascension day . 
Darn you , Lindor truffles ! 
The angels are trippin ' me out ... again . 
I end up in a lot of ' hth did I get here ? ' moments . 
Free archangel/ascended masters card readings . Let me know . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > is still my boo ... In spirit . 
According to this science magazine quiz , I most likely have a schizotypal personality ... On every question ... Oh , boy ... 
\ .... When life was a reaction 
Question : How does man learn to love the character he plays ? He can easily love the others he interacts with . He can love the fact that he gets cast in his role . But how does he find affection for the role itself ? How does he find love for the self ?

It’s so close that I can taste its vapors . I feel a shake in my spine sometimes . Energy waves through my feet and pours into my head . Pouring things I can’t fully , consciously understand quite yet . Though , I think that if I had it at the moment I write this , my body might break apart .
