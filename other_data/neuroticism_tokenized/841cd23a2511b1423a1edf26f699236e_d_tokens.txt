Just got home from watching the opera with < PROPFEMALE > and I have three thoughts : 1 . It is impossible to watch the Barber of Seville without Bugs < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > Fudd running through the back of your mind , 2 . The general plot of romantic comedies has been a 
FACEBOOK EXPERIMENT- if you are reading this , whether we do or don't speak often , post a comment of your first memory of you and me . When you've finished , post this paragraph on your own status ; you'll be surprised what people remember about you !

Definition 1 : Funny , Cute , Huggable You have to know a Kirsty , if not go out and find one . Definition 2 : A polite , lovey person who always thinks about the world around her . She enjoys wasting paper making ' Gift Certificates ' for friends .

So fipping tired and beat down ! I want a hamburger , yellow cupcakes with chocolate frosting , and a hug ! 
Please copy and paste this to your status if you know someone , or have been affected by someone , who needs a punch in the face . People who need a punch in the face affect the lives of many . There is still no known cure for someone who deserves a punch in the face , except a punch in the face , but we can raise awareness . 
Has anyone ever looked at their life , wanted to make some changes , then looked at how much work making the changes would be and decided to deal with things the way they are ? Or am I just lazy ? :) 
Hey all , please copy and post for me : < PROPFEMALE > ring-neck dove found trapped in some bushes at the corner of < PROPFEMALE > and 10th in Bozeman .

Is it strange that the sounds of the neighbor's chickens make me really homesick ? 
< PROPMALE > and I went ouside this a.m. and discovered a rainbow in the western sky as the sun < PROPFEMALE > in the east . Then we ran inside and discovered mommy left her camera at the salon . Bugger ! Oh well , the photo wouldn't have done it justice :) So beautiful !

Heading on vacation today ! 
Self-Awareness is the eyes to see when our minds are upside down & our emotional impulses are masquerading as calls to action . For explosions in health , wealth , & happier relationships we must become more self-aware & stop seeing all of our damn impulses as mandatory calls to action . What we can see we can control-what we can't see controls us . BGTD ! - < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > 
The only difference between a grave and a rut is the depth of the hole . Ruts of complacent relationships & careers cause the death of our happiness & wealth . And there are only two emotions powerful enough to snap us out of it , inspiration or desperation . If you can't get inspired , may a crisis come down your rut & give you the desperation to get your ass out of it . - < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > 
Word for the day : Realization ; which is the exhilaration you feel when a new awareness suddenly & unexpectedly comes up in you . And the most glorious realization you can have is realizing that you are greater than you have been led to believe you are . It's called the OH MY GOD AHA & the day you have it-buckle up baby because that's the day the explosion begins . BGTD ! - < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > 
For ongoing wealth get over TIS The Impostor Syndrome ; The dreadful habit of blowing off your accomplishments as luck rather than hard work-feeling undeserving-thinking that you've fooled people into believing you are more intelligent than you are & living in fear of being found out . Fact : TIS is a bunch of BS -You deserve what you have & are smarter than you know . So Stop TIS-ing around & explode . BGTD ! - < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > 
It's easy to see the bad . It takes effort to see The Good . Many of us were raised in negativity & became skillful at it . Negative energy breeds annihilation sabotages wealth & destroys hope . The elixirs of positive energy is healing & it breeds creativity & reveals all kinds of wealth . As we unlearn negativity- positive energy unleashes & our life transforms . So unlearn negative unleash positive & explode . BGTD ! 
One of the greatest realizations we can have is : It's not too late , we can make up for mistakes of lost time , lost money & relationships & not end up with a wasted life . This life changing realization unleashes in us remarkable hope & empowers us with the resolve to recover fast . So drop the ' It's too late for me crap ' ... & start recovering now ! BGTD ! See More 
Sometimes the most loving thing we can do for another is to allow them to fully experience the natural consequences of their self defeating habits and not give in when they come to us to bail them out . To bail them out is to < PROPMALE > them of the opportunity to learn from their own self imposed suffering . To give in is to enable them to stay sick . Detach with love & watch them grow . BGTD ! 
Learning to detach with love is about allowing those we love to fail & learn from their own mistakes even when it's painful for both of us . It's also about loving ourselves enough to not be led by them to feel guilty or responsible for their failure . Detachment with love requires extraordinary insight & faith but the rewards are worthy of the pains to attain them . Detach with love & watch your life explode . BGTD ! 
DWL ( Detachment With Love ) is an essential skill for greater self-worth & healthier relationships . DWL is about healing our need to rescue save or fix people who are stuck in dysfunction . DWL empowers us to help those we care about to get well with us or to get on with their life . The more we practice it the more wholeness we enjoy & the healthier our relationships get . Practice DWL & watch your life explode BGTD ! 
Positive Energy is a name for The Power within us-which is Greater than us-that waits on us to wake up to Its Presence-so that It can work with us to achieve an extraordinary life . Believing in the inner Power of your Positive Energy is called Faith in your Greater Self . Those who demonstrate such faith achieve a life ... that the many wish they had . Believe , receive & achieve . BGTD ! 
Nothing changes if nothing changes . If doing things your way is no longer working , for God's sake don't put more energy into trying to make it work . All that'll do is-make it NOT WORK FASTER & make you even crazier than you are right now ! Stop doing things your way ! Why ? Because IT'S NOT WORKING ! Stop holding on to it-let it go-give it up-lay it down-learn something new & watch your life explode . BGTD ! 
Cousins are there as your built-in childhood friends , and they are there when you are older as forever friends .... No one will ever understand your crazy family like your cousins ! Repost if you have cousins that make you smile . Love you guys !!! 
The tides of life keep on flowing . Tide comes in-tide goes out- sometimes it's good-sometimes it's bad-sometimes it's better-sometimes it's worse sometimes it's < PROPMALE > sometimes it's poor . Stop allowing your emotions to be dependent on the tides , lest you end up schizophrenic . Keep demonstrating your faith by suiting up , showing up , shutting up , growing up & going up & watch your life explode ! BGTD ! 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > - Step Up\ 
Everyday we get better at whatever we're doing on that day . If our daily doing is to dwell than day after day we are learning how to dwell even better . Some have gotten so good at daily dwelling it's becomes natural & they're now highly skilled at living in the hell of dwell . Don't let this happen to you . Don't dwell-do well & watch your life explode ! BGTD ! 
Watch out for the ' I can't help myself , I've always been this way & if you really loved me you'd accept me just the way I am ' Syndrome . Those who suffer from this particular dysfunction keep the drama going by their uncanny ability to surround themselves with a herd of enablers who are willing to put up with their bull shit . If you have it- break it ! If you're enabling it-stop it & watch your life explode ! BGTD ! 
Be mindful of relationships you have with high maintenance people-Those very demanding & emotionally needy individuals who over dramatize most situations to gain your attention . People with the lowest level of self esteem require the high level of maintenance . For explosions in wealth wake them up or shake them off lest you get the life sucked out of you . Do it now & watch your life explode BGTD ! 
Michaelism : Be mindful of the ' I can't help the way I am-I was raised in a dysfunctional family ' story . Climbing up our family tree and seeing neurotics hanging on some limbs doesn't condemn us to staying crazy but believing that we can't change because of upbringing does . We can have an extraordinary life despite of our upbringing For explosions in wealth & well being-drop the story & watch your life explode . BGTD 
Be mindful of your need to be really needed-lest you attract people into your life who are really needy . This is co-dependency , which is fancy speak for DTP ( disease to please ) . As you heal DTP you get healthy & the needy people you’ve attracted get healthy or leave you & find someone else to use . In either case you’re better off . For the good of all & the harm of none-heal DTP & watch your life explode . BGTD ! 
Relationships are all about agreements . Healthy relationships are people who thrive together on very clear agreements they've made with each other & who do a great job at keeping them . Sick relationships are troubled entanglements with people barely surviving on fuzzy agreements & broken words . Stay with the thrivers-drop the survivors & watch your life explode . BGTD ! 
< PROPFIRST > Cole : BGTD ! is my acronym for Boom Goes The Dynamite- Dynamite is my word for profound knowledge- Boom is an explosion-Explosions are sudden & substantial releases of energy . We always get explosions in positive energy whenever when we access & take action on Profound Knowledge . Positive Energy as in Money , Emotional Well-Being & Healthy Relationships . So < PROPFEMALE > out on my pages of Profound Knowledge & explode . 
Explosions\ 
in wealth require being less judgmental & opinionated . Judgment is \ 
the enemy of wisdom because what we judge-we cannot understand . As we \ 
learn to live in an attitude of non-judgment of others and \ 
ourselves-we're less interested and affected by other peoples judgments \ 
& opinions of us . This is the essence of personal freedom . Seek to \ 
understand more-judge less & watch your life explode . BGTD ! 
To stop craziness stop hanging out with Crazy Makers . People who never want to taking responsibility for their part of the problem . Crazy Makers really do believe that there's such a thing as one sided conflicts . They manipulate the situation to keep the focus off themselves & only on your part of the problem . Get out of those relationships now lest you go insane . Drop Crazy Makers & watch your life explode . BGTD ! 
Thanksgiving is all about giving thanks for the good we've been given . Therefore let us be mindful of the most important attitude we can have-The Attitude of Gratitude . Feelings of Gratitude compel us into right action & right action always brings more good to into our life to be grateful for . This is what it means to live in The Flow of Abundant Life . So live in The Flow & watch your Life Glow . BGTD ! 
Thanksgiving shopping and Christmas List both finished , now I'm eating < PROPMALE > & Cheese and watching Polar Express . It's a good day :) 
They're are those who hatefully complain about things they have that they don't want or things they want that they don't have . And then they're those who accept the good they've been given & express gratitude for having it . The hateful condemn themselves to chaos drama & scarcity- the grateful are prospered with wealth ... & well-being . Detach from the hateful & < PROPFEMALE > with the grateful & watch your life explode . BGTD ! 
Never wait for life to get good before expressing gratitude for the good you have . This is called taking your good for granted & it condemns you to loss & pain for whatever you take for granted-you lose ! Gratitude gets you more good-Take good for granted & you to lose it . If Thank You is the only prayer you ever say-that'll keep you in the flow . So give thanks on Thanksgiving & watch your good explode . BGTD ! 
Things keep happening that remind me of last year ... Please don't let this year be like last year ! 
Happy Thanksgiving !!! 
We must become keenly aware of those places in our life where we use pleasing others as a way of feeling safe or where fear of other people's anger & rejection determine what we say or do . Fostering this kind of self awareness is essential for our greater self worth because what we are aware of we can overcome-what we're unaware of overcomes us . Wake up to it- break free from it & then watch your life explode . BGTD ! 
Those who are hopelessly attached to people that make them miserable are miserable because they're frantically trying to change people they cannot change . As we begin accepting the fact that we're miserably attached to people over which we are powerless over changing-those same people begin to lose their power to make us miserable . Accept those you cannot change-detach from them & watch your life explode . BGTD ! 
Watching White Cristmas and missing Mom and < PROPFEMALE > Joy ! 
Many of us grew up in unhealthy families where daily reality was drama & chaos & the only thing that saved our ass were the survival skills we learned along the way . But today those same skills that got us out alive are now limiting our potential to explode our wealth & happiness . To ignite the explosion we must be willing to unlearn the limitation . Demonstrate this willingness & watch your life explode . BGTD ! 
There's times when shit happens , our attitude turns to crap and we're a pain in the ass to ourselves & everyone around us . Anger , worry & depression are tell tale signs this has happened & that we're coo coo for coco puffs . In those moments we must not trust what our thinking is telling us , have faith that more will be revealed & believe that this too shall pass & when it does watch our life explode again . BGTD ! 
Changeyour Facebook profile picture to a cartoon from your childhood and invite your friends to do the same . Until Monday Dec . 6th , there should be no human faces on Facebook , but an invasion of memories ! This is for a campaign against violence on children 
Denial is the habit of reducing fear to confront a problem & not take responsibility to solve the damn thing by denying it exists . Denial helps me to feel better about my shit by pretending I don’t have any-mean while everyone around me is stepping in it . If someone you love lives in denial watch out to not cosign their bullshit lest both of you drown in it . Detach from denial & watch your life explode . BGTD ! 
Acceptance doesn't mean putting up with-tolerating-settling for or ignoring those who make me crazy . Acceptance is about giving attention to parts of the problem I can do something about which is myself-my attitude & my reactions & detaching my attention from your part . Words like-this is really bad or they've got to change are judgments & keep me stuck in shit . Judge less accept more & watch your life explode . BGTD ! 
Willingness\ 
is the cornerstone on which extraordinary lives are built . The moment\ 
you become willing miraculous changes take place in your attitude &\ 
you begin to attain greater wealth & happier relationships . \ 
Willingness is personal no one can make you willing it's something \ 
you can decide to be for yourself . Your willingness to be ignites the \ 
power to receive . Become willing & watch your life explode BGTD ! 
One of the ugliest tendencies one can have is to strengthen destructive behavior of dysfunctional people by repeated attempts to rescue or fix them . This tendency is called enabling & those who do it are called enablers . Explosions in well being , personal freedom & healthy relationships begin to occur the moment one decides to resign from the role being an enabler . Resign from it now & watch your life explode . BGTD ! 
As I resign from being an enabler , wonderful change occurs . I'm less plagued by the obsession to fix people . Those who need fixing are learning to clean up their own shit or find other enablers to enable them to stay stuck in it . Regardless-I'm learning healthier ways of feeling self worth & those around me seem to be getting healthier . Learn to enable less & detach more & watch your life explode . BGTD 
For explosions in wealth take the time to pause . Before making decisions-pause . Before beginning & ending the day- pause . Before reacting to anger , depression & worry-pause . Before making harsh judgments or giving critical opinions-pause . The still small voice of intuition speaks to us all in the silence of the pause . React less-pause more & watch your life explode . BGTD ! 
Don’t wait TO FEEL LIKE IT before doing something that needs to get done . The Good Life is only for those with the willingness to do what needs to get done whether they feel like it or not . Those whose actions are dependent on feelings live a shitty life . Willingness to disobey the ‘I don’t feel like its’ is called courage and the few who have it enjoy more success than the many who don’t . BGTD ! 
It's time for Holidays with The Clan ; Parents , Siblings , Grandparents , Aunts , Uncles , Cousins , Nieces , Nephews , In Laws , Out Laws & everything between . Practice detachment , acceptance , non-judgment & listening , for these are greater expressions of Love . Greater Love also protects us from crazy makers . Express Greater Love in these ways & watch your holiday be Joyful . Now have a Happy Holiday . BGTD ! 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas to Whos far and near !

Stay tuned for part 3 & get set to explode . BGTD ! 
Resolutions for explosions in 2011 Part 3 : Never set a resolution to explode income without a resolution to clean up ‘personal issues’- money magnifies our ‘issues’-When people with ' anger issues ' get more money they become terriers’ . When people with ‘drinking issues’ get more money they end up in detox or jail . Get your issues handled as you make more money-lest you blow yourself up & miss out on wealth . BGTD ! 
Resolutions for 2011 Part 4 : For explosions in self worth & healthier relationships-resolve to increase your take home pay & be less financially dependant on your mate & your mate has less dependants to worry about . Nothing makes self worth & healthier relationships better than becoming more financially independent of others .

Resolutions for 2011 Part 5 : Those with Obsessive Compulsive Achievement Disorder whose drug of choice is more-more-more-better-better better-faster-faster-faster . ( it takes one to know one ) Set a resolution to lighten up slow it down take it easy & stop killing flies with shotguns ! ( This one’s got my name written all over it ! ) Stress comes down-achievements go up & people relax cuz we’re not so crazy . BGTD !

Resolve to avoid those who suck courage out of you-hang with those who pour courage into you & watch your life explode . BGTD ! 
Resolutions for 2011 Part 7 : For explosions in security & wealth set a resolution to handle your daily tips wisely . Stop allowing your family to use you as their personal ATM machine . Save a minimum of 20% of your daily tip income & protect the money from yourself by putting the $ somewhere that you can’t get to when you’re bored anxious or depressed . Resolve to stash cash & watch your wealth explode . BGTD ! 
Resolutions for 2011 Part 9 : Resolve to detach from high maintenance relationships with needy people by being less sympathetic & more compassionate . Sympathy is to feel sorry for & rescue someone from a self created mess . Compassion is helping someone to learn & grow from their mess without cleaning it up for them . Less sorrow more compassion = Healthy People Healthy Relationships & BGTD ! 
Self-Confidence : The courage to ‘fake till you make it’ . Better to act your way into feeling confident instead of waiting to feel confident before acting . But Use your confidence with care lest your arrogance makes you a legend in your own mind . Boomers of great wealth are only for those have learned to be confident without conceit . Learn to use your confidence correctly & watch your life boom . BGTD ! 
Please put this status if you know someone or are related to someone who was eaten by dragons . Dragons are nearly unstoppable and if you didn't know , they can breathe fire . 93% of people won't copy and paste this , because they were already eaten by dragons , 6% of people are sitting in the shower ... armed with fire-extinguishers , and the remaining 1% are awesome and will re-post this . 
For Boomers in wellbeing , take daily actions to get , stay & be well . To allow our self to stay stuck in states of stress & despair & take no action to resolve it is selfish . Remaining stuck is to be an unnecessary burden to everyone around us including ourselves . One of the biggest favors we can do for those we work and live with is to be easier to be around by being well . Get well , stay well , be well & boom . BGTD ! 
When does ‘IT’ change ? When does ‘IT’ get better ? ‘IT’ is my mate , my kids , my job , my friends . ‘IT’ is my life . ‘IT’ will not change & ‘IT’ does not get better until I change & get better . Symposium is one of those events that unleashes better change in me and invariably soon after that ‘IT’ changes . That’s why people refer to Symposium as a Life Changing event . Can’t wait for The Booming to begin . BGTD ! 
There are really only two kinds of mistakes we make . The mistake we make by learning new skills that revolutionize our life & the mistake we make by deciding not to try because of the fear we have of making mistakes . The 1st mistake ignites explosions of wealth & joy in our life . The 2nd mistake condemns us to a dreadful life of drama chaos & scarcity . Drop the fear of mistake making & watch your life Boom . BGTD ! 
Pivotal People are people who have profoundly affected our life . If definable moments are moments , which revolutionize our life , then pivotal people are those who make those moments definable . Pivotal People believe in & inspire us to take life- changing actions that we would not have taken . We all need pivotal people that make us go Boom ! May Symposium be the place where you meet your next pivotal person . BGTD ! 
Dwelling is the self-degrading habit of beating the crap out myself after I’ve made a mistake & then worrying myself to death over what other people are thinking about me for dropping the ball . They who are filled with guilt shame & worry live dreadful lives in The Hell of Dwell . When you mess up clean it up , forgive yourself learn the damn lesson & move on . To hell with dwell instead get well & boom . BGTD ! 
Pouting is what impossible to please people do to punish others for failing to please them . What makes this kind of moody crazy making so cruel isn’t the pouters prolonged period of silent scorn-it’s when their asked if something is wrong-their reply is ‘No-nothings wrong-I'm fine . ’ If you pout-stop it . If you < PROPFEMALE > with pouters detach from them lest you go crazy . Stop the pouts & watch your life go boom . BGTD ! 
Why , oh why did I book a 6:30 flight ?! 
Acceptance B4 detachment . Acceptance says I accept that I am powerless to change this person that I’ve been busting my butt to change-the only thing I can change are my futile reactions to their craziness . Detachment is how I change my futile reactions to intelligent responses . As I get better from detaching-they’ll get better or find others to make crazy-either way I’m better off . Accept , detach & go boom . BGTD ! 
Syposium was amazing , but boy am I happy to be home ! I'm pooped :) 
Nothing keeps us attached to who or what we need to be detached from as SELF-CENTERED FEAR , the fear of not getting what we want , or the fear of losing what we have . And the only thing strong enough to conquer this kind of fear is courage . We get courage the moment we begin believing that whatever we’re afraid of losing or not getting will be replaced with something greater . Believe courageously and boom . BGTD ! 
As long as we accept OPJ–Other People’s Judgments of us for not giving into their demands-they will control us with guilt . Example-A person tries to take advantage of you-you resis t-t hey get angry at you-you feel guilty & give in . For boomers in happiness stop ‘guilt trips’ until people in your life no longer count on you to always feel guilty for not giving into their incessant demands . Stop Guilt & Boom . BGTD ! 
For boomers in happiness & wealth ‘Keep The Faith’-don’t allow worry to take your attention off of your Faith-not even for a single moment . Nothing equals the greatness of this attitude . When things feel bad & look their wors t-t hat is the supreme moment to throw yourself deep into in your Faith & to remember that your Faith will always do more for you than worry ever will . Now have a Faith-full day & Boom . BGTD ! 
Boomers in emotional & financial wealth demand that we < PROPMALE > the worrywart . The moment we engage in the self-defeating process of worry we begin bringing into our life the very thing we’re worried is going to happen . Waking up to this shocking truth gives you powerful reason to disobey fear & get busy taking action to solve your problems instead of worrying about them . < PROPMALE > that damn wart & go boom . BGTD ! 
Naysayers that discourage you from stepping up your life suffer from envy . Envy says I’m not willing to go for the good life I see you stepping up to but I don’t want you to get it either because seeing you have it reminds me that I lack the confidence & courage you have & I’m not ready to deal with that yet-so be complacent with me so I can be comfortable staying stuck . Detach from the envious & go boom . BGTD ! 
Detachment starts with detaching from my own needs for OPA- Other People's Approval of me . OPJ-Other People's Judgments of me . OP O-O ther People's Opinions of me . OPE-Other People's Expectations of me . Detachment requires moving out of ' The Land of OP'S ' and attaching myself to much Greater Ideas- ideas rooted in Truth . When I don't detach my life feels gloomy-When I stay detached & my life keeps booming . BGTD ! 
Willingness is the active ingredient to transforming our life . Willingness to believe which is called faith-willingness to take right actions , which is called initiative & most important willingness to disobey the fear that comes when taking those actions , which is called courage . Nobody can make you willing it’s a decision only you can make-but when you make it , boom goes the dynamite ! Decide now & Boom . BGTD ! 
Knowing the difference between compassion & sympathy allows you to help people grow up instead of enabling them to stay a mess . Compassion says I care about your suffering & I will help you get through it without getting sucked into your mess . Sympathy says seeing you suffer scares me into bailing you out of your mess even though it keeps both of us sick . Compassion without sympathy is Detachment With Love . BGTD ! 
For boomers in emotional freedom learn to detach with love from the Martyr’s in your life . Martyrs are skillful manipulators who guilt us into giving them what they want by pretending to suffer . As we demonstrate the courage of allowing Martyrs to do for themselves , they stop being Martyrs or & find other enablers to manipulate & victimize . In either case we wake up & get well . Detach from Martyrs & boom . BGTD ! 
Brrr !!! 
Under the need for approval is fear of disapproval . Under the need for acceptance is fear of rejection . Under the need to be liked is fear of being disliked . Three dubious needs fueled by three crippling fears left unhealed destroy the promise of greater wealth & self worth . If you suffer from such-wake up now , don’t feed the need , defy the fear , take action to heal & let the boomers begin . BGTD ! 
People who believe that being confused means they’re stupid are governed by a lie that's keeps them from learning something new . Confusion is what we experience right before we have a big aha that changes our life for the better & the more confused we are the bigger & better the aha . For boomers in wealth & wisdom stop avoiding confusion & start learning to endure it & then watch the dynamite go boom . BGTD ! 
What a ride it is-this thing called Life ! At times it's terrific at times it’s terrifying ! At times it soars high & other times it feels like a death spiral . Predictably unpredictable-excruciatingly wonderful ! It’s one hell of a glorious ride & I wouldn’t have any other way . Best of all I get to take it with you & I love that ! So buckled up my friends cuz it's time to Boom & Zoom BGTD ! 
Letters to < PROPFEMALE > could have been great if it had only ended about 10 minutes earlier ! 
Nothing sabotages our ability to detach from manipulators & crazy makers than when we’re reacting to the bad emotions they trigger in us . The moment we get triggered-bad feelings come up-we go blind- get attached & get sucked into drama . Therefore the 1st place to detach is from our own emotional baggage . Only as we learn to detach from that will the dynamite go boom . Learn to detach & go Boom BGTD ! 
For boomers in emotional wealth & healthier relationships take daily actions that dispel self-doubt & deepen faith in your own self worth . Nothing equals the greatness in taking actions that heal doubts & fosters faith . Feeling great about our selves is the < PROPFEMALE > key to bringing out the greatness in others . Today’s your day to make a contribution to your own well-being . Do it & watch your life go boom . BGTD ! 
The most despicable word in the human vocabulary is the word Stupid ! Nothing binds you to emotional upset , personal loss & financial scarcity than the belief that you’re stupid . Those who got you to believe in that dreadful idea are damn liars . Just because you don’t catch on as quickly as others doesn’t mean you’re stupid . It means you’re learning & soon you’ll have it down . Drop that lie & you'll go boom . BGTD ! 
Two debilitating dependencies to avoid are emotional & financial dependency ; the need to be fed , fondled & financed by others . Depending too much on others to give you emotional or financial security is a hell of a trap because you’ll eventually come to hate those you depend too much on & hate your self for staying in the situation . If this is you break the spell to get out of hell & watch your life boom . BGTD ! 
Faith is believing in your Greater Self . From Faith comes courage . Wisdom is knowing what you need to do ; Wisdom comes when Faith is strong . No situation is too hopeless to find happiness , too difficult to be bettered or too dreadful to overcome . As Faith & Wisdom grow your situation loses its power to dominate your thoughts , govern your emotions , and run your life . Build Faith-Get Wisdom & Boom . BGTD ! 
The greatest realization you can have is that it’s not too late , you can make up for lost time , opportunities & fortunes & not end up with a wasted life . I’ve had two of them . The 1st was when I was 25 & the 2nd was at 45 . Both times I was in crisis & despair & right after I was filled with tremendous hope , the fuse was reignited & the dynamite went boom . If this is you may you be re-ignited to boom again . BGTD !

RE-POSTED WITH VITAL CHANGES 
Rid your self of all resentment . It is the inner thief that robs us of healthy relationships , an emotional cancer that kills joyful living , a financial virus that ruins wealth . Resentments are grudges we hold on those we feel have betrayed & harmed us or have kept us from greater achievement . Left unhealed resentments form hardness of the attitudes-cynicism & sarcasm . Drop resentment & Boom . BGTD 
We must not allow our self the dubious luxury of staying resentful ; it’s an emotionally debilitating spiral to stay in-an obstacle of recovery & growth . The profound consequences of unhealed resentment is dangerous : It's the root of depression & it blocks emotional growth & healthy relationships . Only when the need to recover is more important than the need to resent does the dynamite go boom . BGTD ! 
The effects of resentments are painful , but the pain eventually wake us up to the real cause of our suffering & empowers us with the willingness to bring resentments to an end . As the light of greater understanding & true perspective come into us our resentments lose their power to govern our life & we are given the grace to let them go . This is what true forgiveness is . Wake up , let go , forgive & go boom . BGTD ! 
We freak out whenever it looks like our life is coming at us at point blank range-so damn fast we don’t know what we’re doing and it’s all going to crash . Those are the supreme moments to remember that not knowing what to do doesn’t make you crazy , it’s needing to know now that does . And if you keep the faith , the answer will be revealed , it too shall pass & the dynamite will go boom . BGTD 
Avoid those who create drama & chaos by running around & getting people to agree with what they believe is true even when it’s BS . To believe in OPC ( Other People’s Crap ) is to have your life turn to S#*t ! Only when your beliefs are rooted in Truth does the fuse gets ignited and the dynamite goes boom . Drop the drama & chaos dudes , follow Truth with a wise attitude & ignite the dynamite to Boom . BGTD ! 
Watch what goes on in that 6-inch space in between your ears it’s the most important space in your life ! Inside of it is Grand Central Station with many trains of thought coming in & going out . Guess what ? You don't have to get on every damn train that comes in . Watch the trains come & go B4 you jump on-lest you wind up in a dangerous hood . Watch B4 you ride & the dynamite goes boom . BGTD ! 
There are those we love who are needy & impossible to please , who always want , expect & demand more time , emotions or money than we can give . As we detach from our own guilt of saying no to them & not allow their barrage of incessant demands to control our life , they learn to get well & take care of themselves & we will have done the same . Only when we detach with love does the dynamite go boom . BGTD ! 
Boomers in healthy salon cultures & trustworthy friendships demand that we stop engaging in gossip , rumors & malicious chatter about other people . Nothing destroys trust , emotional safeness & genuine camaraderie than the despicable words of gossip hounds & rumormongers . Only when we replace maliciousness & vindictiveness with kindness & love will the dynamite go boom for all . All grace no gossip & boom . BGTD ! 
I would like my Facebook friends to comment on this status , sharing how you met me . But I want you to LIE . That's right , just make it up . After you comment , copy this to your status , so I can do the same . I bet half won't read the instructions right ! 
Analysis paralysis is the tendency to put off getting important things done until you figure out how to do them perfectly right . Those who are afflicted with this self-defeating habit are Procrastinating Perfectionis t-t hey think too damn much , do too damn little & have damn near nothing . If it’s worth doing-it’s worth doing half assed until you figure out the other half . Think less , do more , learn fast & boom . BGTD ! 
The best way to express love for Life is to be grateful for the good that Life gives . The moment we express our love for Life by grateful acts of giving , Life immediately responds by giving us back more good than we’ve given . This is how The Great Law of Life works . We can never out give Life . We always get more from Life of whatever we give . Being more Grateful & Giving more good makes The Dynamite Boom . BGTD 
Went to a amazing Sexy Hair class with amazing people for an amazing cause last night ! Thank you to everyone who attended and who made it possible ! 
Adversities are the losses in our life , which cause us suffering . Adversity comes with life-no one gets through without them . Adversity will either make you better or bitter . Greatness begins the moment you decide that it’ll be better & come back stronger than you were before it knocked you down . When you make that decision the dynamite goes boom . Here’s to your dramatic recovery from the next adversity . BGTD ! 
For Boomers in Wealth & Worthiness talk to people daily who give you the needed perspective & encouragement to face whatever your situation in . Take time for personal reflection to build the faith you need to endure . And don’t isolate yourself-where all you're listening to are your own fears & doubts . Being diligent in these ways will keep you awake & make the dynamite go boom . BGTD !

To the mean hearted who say ‘this is just a job- I just work here with these people-my family’s more important to me than this job . I say no it’s not ‘just a job’ work is sacred-no they’re not ‘just people you work with’- you live with people you work with-they’re like family & Stop the ‘my family’ BS- If you're mean & selfish at work you're that way at home . Wake up- grow up-be nice & boom . BGTD ! 
Two qualities of energy–positive & negative . Positive energy is miraculous- it energizes , inspires & ignites explosions of creative unity . Negative energy is malicious-it corrupts , corrodes & breeds dissension & strife . One energy leads to greater wellbeing & wealth-the other leads to disease & loss . Both are contagious-so be mindful which of the two you catch . Catch The miraculous & boom ! BGTD !

There are days when life says it’s your turn to take a hit . Hits are unexpected random events that come with life . Hits catch us by surprise take the wind out of us & bring us to our knees . It’s not the hit that makes matters , it’s if we choose to respond with faith or react with fear . Responses make us better , reactions keep us broke . Respond the dynamite goes boom . BGTD ! 
To the skeptics who say bull s#*t , I’ll believe it when I see it . I say no my little entra-manure , you got it back-ass wards ! You’ll see it only when you believe it- most important you’ll receive it only when you believe it . Believing that it’s all a bunch of bull s#*t keeps you from receiving boomers in wealth-it also insures that you receive more bull s#*t . Believing in The Truth makes the dynamite boom . BGTD ! 
Nothing keeps us attached to the approval of others than the belief that without it we cannot be happy . Underneath the need for approval is fear of disapproval & the belief that our self-worth comes from others . As we realize that our self-worth is in our hearts & not in others , the need for approval loses it’s power & we are free to live the life we deserve . Knowing you are worthy makes the dynamite go boom . BGTD ! 
Holy jumping off places are those definable moments in our life when a crucial decision must be made-to either stay stuck in the crap or make a change for the better . During such times may you be occupied by faith & guided by intuition instead of being possessed by fear & driven by instinct . Only when faith is our root and intuition our guide does the dynamite go boom . BGTD ! 
In honor of MS awareness week , March 7th-13th , 2011 . I am asking if everyone could please put this as your status for one hour if you or someone you love has Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) . My prayer is that in 2011 a cure will be found . Will you post it ? Do it in the memory and the honor of those fighting MS . 
One of The Greatest Principles to become skillful at practicing is The Principle of Forgiveness . The essence of forgiveness is giving up the belief that the past should have been different than it was and to accept it as being what it is . Practicing The Principle of Forgiveness is painful but the extraordinary pleasures we experience from its payoffs are well worth the pain we endure to receive them . BGTD ! 
Willingness-Willingness-Willingness-it’s all about Willingness . The willingness to disobey the fear that comes with continuing to suit up & show up , the willingness to believe in the good that Life offers those who do & most important the willingness to believe in your worthiness to have it all . That my friend is the secret to making the dynamite go boom !. BGTD ! 
Avoid the swirling tornado of back room drama . Learn to be in it without being of it . \ 
Don't agree with it-agreeing increase it . Don't disagree with it-disagreeing empowers it to control you . Listen quietly & after awhile it leaves you to find others to possess . Listening without judgment makes the dynamite go boom BGTD ! 
Greater Wealth & Loving Relationships never lead to Joyfulness . It's the other way around . Joyfulness leads to Greater Wealth & Loving Relationships . Don't wait for wealth & romance before allowing yourself to be joyful-lest you be broke lonely & miserable . Allow yourself be joyful NOW - Radiate your joy onto those you live with work with & serve-let your joy ignite the fuse-only then does the dynamite Boom . BGTD ! 
To those who struggle with keeping their word & have a track record of broken agreements , consider this : I hear what you say but I watch what you do . And because doing what you say influences the person I see you as being-who you’ve become screams so loudly into my ears I no longer hear what you’re saying . Our world is made by the words we keep . Only when we keep our word does the dynamite go boom . BGTD ! 
Staying in dysfunctional work environments , friendships and relationships , keeping things the same , not changing anything , expecting that it will all get better and becoming hostile or depressed when it gets worse-guess what this pattern is called . INSANITY ! You can change without growing but you can't grow without changing . The moment we get the courage to change for the better the dynamite goes boom . BGTD ! 
It takes courage to no longer be caretakers of dysfunctional people & focus on healing our own dysfunctional need to take care of them . It takes courage to give up on trying to please impossible to please people & focus on healing our own disease to please . Detaching from the need to change others & focusing on changing your self , is called the courage to change . Courage like that makes the dynamite go boom . BGTD 
Egomaniacs are victims of an obsessive preoccupation with self , governed by selfishness and possessed by delusions of personal greatness . Behind every egomaniac is low self-esteem . If you work or live with one , stay detached-lest you become their slave . If you are one , wake up , clean up , & grow up before you blow up . Get well & Boom BGTD ! 
When facing indecision and not knowing what direction to take , always remember to take the time to pause and ask for inspiration & the right decision . Then relax , stop struggling , wait for the answer to come & while you’re waiting do whatever is front of you to do . Sooner or later it’ll come and later always comes sooner than you think . And when it does the dynamite will go boom . BGTD ! 
Emotionalism is the habit of over reacting to everything with exaggerated emotions . To over exaggerate and make more out of situations than is necessary . A simpler word for this is DRAMA ! For boomers in wealth & happiness detach from Drama Makers lest they become your emotional vampire by sucking all of the energy you use to make the dynamite go boom . Drop Drama Makers & Boom . BGTD ! 
When quitting is a habit , we get locked into the loop & all we're good at is starting over & bailing out shortly after . From moving around to job-hopping to start-stop relationships it never ends . Trying to out run unhappiness by finding new places to go to . Only to meet it there when we arrive . 80% of breaking the loop is seeing it . What you see you can stop what you can’t see stops you . Look break & boom . BGTD ! 
BS is a stage we all must go through to learn how to make our life better . Whether it’s learning to end bad relationships or begin to develop good ones BS is where ‘bad stuff’ happens B4 good stuff does . BS is also where many give up & quit because they lack the courage to break through BS . All quitting does is becomes a habit & locks you into a life long loop of limitation . Don't quit-break through & Boom BGTD ! 
You cannot simultaneously allow others to learn from the consequences of their own mistaken actions and react to their hurt feelings . You can do one or the other but you can’t do both . You’ll either give into the temptation to bail them out or you won’t . To give in is to enable them to stay on a downward spiral . To stand firm is to wake them up & support their growth . Standing firm makes the dynamite boom . BGTD ! 
The most intelligent use of positive energy is using it to express gratitude Gratitude is a positive change agent that turns despair into hope and depression into happiness . Gratitude keeps the dynamite booming . Every time we express gratitude for the good we receive the universe has no choice but to prosper us with more good to be grateful for . Show more gratitude & the dynamite goes boom . BGTD !

Storm Starters are drama hounds who hideout in the back room starting emotional tornadoes by spreading negative energy ( gossip ) . Storm Chasers never start tornados but can’t resist the lure to participate in the drama & chaos of tornados . Detach from both lest you get sucked into the swirl & end up sick . Staying clear of Starters & Chasers keeps the dynamite booming . BGTD

Detachment is the key to happier & healthier relationships . It strengthens the ones we want to flourish & thrive and heals the ones that cause us pain & suffering . Detachment isn’t something U do once & then live happily ever after . It’s something U do several times a day . Detachment is a set of daily attitudes & actions that skyrockets your life & makes the dynamite boom . BGTD ! 
Part 2 : Seeing the attachments that keeps U stuck in crap-makes U ready to detach . What U see U stop-what U don't see stops U . Heres a crazy attachment that'll exhaust you to death . I'm responsible for this lunatic & the mess they’re in . I’m the only one who can help cuz I know what’s best for them . If I don’t they’re going to blow up & I can’t live with that ! Detach from crap & go boom . BGTD ! 
What is detachment ? Breaking the attachment/need to rescue & fix those who have become overly dependent on U . To let them fail & not be guilted into to feeling responsible when they do . And to no longer be spell bounded by those you’ve become overly dependent on-who U have previously given a lot of power to affect your emotional wellbeing . BGTD ! 
Detachment does not mean to stop caring ; it’s means learning to care in healthier ways & most important learning to take better care of U . To stop caring in ways that enable people to stay overly dependent on you & not learn from the natural consequences of their own bad decisions & actions . Learning to detach is a beautiful thing-it really makes your dynanamite go boom . BGTD !

Energy received by learning to detach from highly needy people is amazing . The constant grind of needing to save those who create drama & chaos faster than U can bail them out of it is absolutely exhausting . Detaching from the incessant need to save people allows you to save enormous energy & allows them to start learning to save themselves . Detachment makes your energy go boom . BGTD ! 
Fear of failure & rejection governs those of us with self-defeating attachments to the need to be perfect & the need for approval . Here’s the belief both fears are rooted in : If I fail to do this perfectly right , those I depend on for approval will reject me . Detachment is waking up to the attachment , seeing the pain it’s causing & breaking the pattern . Detach & the dynamite booms . BGTD

I have a personal reason for asking if everyone could put this as their status for 1 hour . I'm pretty sure I know the ones that will . Think of someone you know or love who has had cancer . My wish is that in 2011 a cure will be found . Will you post it for 1 hour . To honor those who have fought , died or who are still fighting cancer . Hope to see it in your status -it is a honor to comply 
2nd interview went well . Thank you < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Dershem for being my haircut model and for going out to pizza with me ! 
Here’s a Truth that’ll make our self-worth go boom : In us there is The Presence of a sacred power-a creative energy which is always seeking to express greater good through us into our life . This Presence is as much of who we are as the person we see when we’re looking at our face in the mirror . Nothing equals the greatness of believing in this Truth . Believing this makes the dynamite boom . BGTD ! 
No news on the job today :( Hopefully I'll hear something tomorrow . 
Believing in Greater Truth empowers us with wisdom to see the old ideas we’ve previously believed is a bunch of BS-that other people in our life had judged & led us to believe that we were stupid people who couldn’t do anything right & weren’t worthy of anything better than the little we had . Believing in Greater Truth breaks this despicable spell & makes the dynamite boom . Believe & Boom ! BGTD !
