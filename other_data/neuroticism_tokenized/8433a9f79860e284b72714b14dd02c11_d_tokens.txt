Flamin ' Hot Cheetos . 

I wish I could just work everyday . 
* sigh * 
I need some hardcore prayer going on for me , I'd appreciate it . 
I wish I had to work . 
Saw < PROPFIRST > Cera in Walmart tonight !! 
This cold weather is no bueno .

:) 
Deciding if I should buy a bed or a laptop first .. figuring out whether my sleep or my sanity is more important . 
Freakin ' A man , It's cold here . 
I wish sleep came with rollover minutes . 
White Cheddar Cheez-It's . 
Hot tubbing when it has been snowing XD ! 
Happy New Year :) 
It's like you're deaf to my voice , but I've been here for every moment , waiting on your call to move . \ 
If you could just make a choice , I know you would find me wanting only to be close to you . 
Goodbye world , I'll be back friday .. next friday that is :( Should txt me ;) 
Visiting my family XD ! 
By far the most \happy birthday's\ " I've ever been told :P Thank you all :) " 
Working until the 8th :/ < PROPFEMALE > , You should txt me ;D 
The earth moves and you find me , alive but unworthy broken and empty , but you don't care because you are my rapture , you are my savior when all my hope is gone , I reach for you , you are my rescue . 
Would you be an outlaw for my love . 
I’m at war with the world cause I , ain’t never \ 
gonna sell my soul . I’ve already made up my mind , no matter what I \ 
can’t be bought or sold . When my faith is getting weak , and I feel like\ 
giving in , you breathe into me again . 
Let's pause time . 
The Mindless Are easily Lured . 
Love Is patient , love is kind . It does not envy , it does not boast , it is not proud . It is not rude , it is not self-seeking , it is not easily angered , it keeps no record of wrongs . Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth . It always protects , always trusts , always hopes , always perseveres . - 1 Corinthians 13:4 
\You didn't see those sweet graphics of fire ? \"" 
Listening to their childhood stories as their faces light up with joy , and their laughter of it all almost seems to bring them tears . That is my favorite part of my job , I love it :) 
You're a < PROPFEMALE > , how I found you I still don't know . \ 
But now I got you and I'll never let you go . 
He is jealous for me . \ 
Love's like a hurricane , \ 
I am a tree . \ 
Bending beneath the weight of His wind and mercy . \ 
When all of a sudden , I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by \ 
< PROPFEMALE > , and I realize just how beautiful You are and how great Your affections \ 
are for me . 
4 days until I see my sister , 9 days until bf , 10 days until my family , 11 days until the Cool Tour ! I can't wait ! 
R ? adtrip !!! 
Cool Tour Tonight !!? 
Blessthefall and Underoath were awesomeee !! 
She lives in a < PROPFEMALE > tale , somewhere too far for us to find . \ 
Forgotten the taste and smell , of the world that she's left behind . \ 
It's all about the exposure , the lens , I told her . \ 
The angles were all wrong now . \ 
She's ripping wings off of butterflies . \ 
Keep your feet on the ground , when your head's in the clouds . 
A positive attitude lifts us above our circumstances and enables us to have peace in the midst of the storm and to have joy when there is no visible reason to rejoice . 
I want to play tennis so bad ! <3 
Sitting at a stoplight isn't so bad when you get to watch the person behind you dance to Thriller :P 
Is it just me or do you ever feel like you're the only person in the world that knows how to put the paper towels/toilet paper on the holder the right way ?.. 
Dear pain , oh , it's been a long time , remember when you were holding me tight , I would stay awake with you all night . \ 
Dear shame , I was safe in your arms , you were there when it all fell apart . \ 
I would get so lost in your beautiful lies . \ 
I let you go . \ 
But you're still chasing . 
Our God is greater , our God is stronger , God you are higher than any other , our God is healer , awesome in power , our God , our God . \ 
And if our God is for us , then who could ever stop us , and if our God is with us , then what could stand against . 
Those that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength ; They shall mount up with wings like eagles , they shall run and not be weary , they shall walk and not faint . - < PROPMALE > 40:31 
And when you smile , the whole world stops and stares for awhile , cause you're amazing , just the way you are . 
I've lived in Texas for a year , already ?! 
If I could pull you from the wreckage , we'd be all fine , oh Lord , don't tell me this is happening . \ 
If I could hold you for a second we'd be alright , oh Lord , don't tell me this is happening . \ 
Oh , I never should have let you go . \ 
Until I'll be with you , I'm dying on my own . 
Arise and be all that you dreamed , all that you dream . 
Arise , shine , for your light has come , and the < PROPFEMALE > of the Lord rises upon you . \ 
See , darkness covers the earth and thick darkness is over the peoples , but the Lord rises upon you and His < PROPFEMALE > appears over you . - < PROPMALE > 60:1 -2 
I whisper in your ear , the words you want to hear . \ 
You feel the wind and it reminds you . \ 
It happens everytime , you stop and close your eyes . \ 
You can't deny what lives inside you . \ 
Well I know it's hard to see , what is meant to be . \ 
When yesterday is so far behind you . \ 
Deep inside your soul knows I'm always there . 
Wake up , O sleeper , rise from the dead , and Christ will shine on you . -Ephesians 5:14 
Look past the circumstance and find some meaning . 
Those who live in the shelter of the Most High will find rest in the shadow of the Almighty . -Psalm 91:1 
R ? ADTRIP !!! 
Concert ! Blessthefall , chiodos , Atreyu .. :D 
Now we see that everything we have , and everything we lack , is exactly what we need . Every single day , everything we've made , has put us in this place in just this way . 
You're trapped in a cave , confined . Falling back to the comfort of your world . \ 
The last time you walked away from this , you were looking back to see what you missed . 
I see her smile in her sleep , I know that she's a dreamer . 
I want to break every clock . \ 
The hands of time could never move again . \ 
We could stay in this moment for the rest of our lives . \ 
Is it over now hey , hey is it over now . 
** NEW FACEBOOK GAME ** Inbox me your credit card number , expiration date , and 3-digit security code and I'll post which bills I paid with it on my status . This should be fun !! 
Okay Fine , I give in .. send me a number .. 
Sometimes I'm a selfish fake , you're always a true friend . \ 
I don't deserve you , cause I'm not there for you , though I wish I would be . 
R ? adtrip to C ?! 
Sitting by a fireplace drinking hot chocolate :) 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas :) 
On the road again .. The drive back is never quite as fun . 
Glad to be back in TX :) 
My days off are lame , what's the point . 
Well what if I don't want the new profile ... 
New FB -.- 
On the road again !... 
Someone come drive me to CO .. prayer for safe driving would be appreciated :) .. I'm sitting in McD's in Hay's KS deciding whether or not to head on or stay here for the night . And with all this you really wonder if the TSA is really that bad ;P 
Thank you all for the birthday wishes . :) 
I praise You because I am fearfully and wonderfully made ; Your works are wonderful , I know that full well . -Psalm 139:14 . 
All my chains I can't disengage\ 
I don't believe that I want to\ 
One hand sings your praise , the other brings me shame\ 
I have sel ? shness to blame\ 
And I'm singing for freedom\ 
I know I'm not the only one\ 
Praying to the One , who can bring me this freedom\ 
I'm ready for change .. \ 
Broken down I lay\ 
I keep holding my chains\ 
No longer bound but here I stay\ 
I scream Father please I need rescuing\ 
I need You and You alone .. 
Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High , will rest in the shadow of the Almighty . -Psalm 91:1 
You scream cause you weren't honest\ 
And you left cause you were wrong\ 
I pray for grace in your decisions\ 
And hope you won't be gone too long\ 
He'll turn it around .. I swear He'll turn it around .. \ 
A new fire lit in you\ 
A new fire , it circles this room\ 
And may you never be afraid of your faith and\ 
When new fire lit in you\ 
A new fire circles this room\ 
And may you never be afraid of your Father . 
Dear TX drivers , \ 
\ 
Apart from you being able to figure out a way to hydroplane in a drop of rain . \ 
I'd appreciate it if you would learn how to drive so you would stop hitting me .
