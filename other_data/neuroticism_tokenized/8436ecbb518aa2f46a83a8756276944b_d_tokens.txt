And so the < PROPFEMALE > departs my court , perhaps never to return again . As I contemplate my loss , my kingdom falls apart around me ... Was it all in vain ? 

~ And as Flesh is torn from Muscle , I am reborn . As Today becomes ash , and the memories of Yesterday fade away , Only Tomorrow Remains ~ 
Took a load of random-ass pics , check them out xD The Shades of Insanity album ~ Comment mine I'll comment yours ... Thanks ~ 
Wrote a new story ! Comments Please :) Putting in my Notes thingy ~ 
Moving this weekend , so many boxes x_X 
Two new piercings , one new awesome poem :) ( well , its actually a set of 18 individual-yet-linked Haiku's :P ) 
Singing phantom of the opera xP 
FML and MLIA are awesome ! 
Anyone know how to get to the town of < PROPFIRST > ?? Important , and I have no clue how to get there . 
Spent all weekend at Jenn's , Thanksgiving Dinner and hanging out , had a lot of fun :) <3 
Once again , Life deals me the Joker card - I hear the hysterical laugh as I fall apart at the seams ; a puppet with his strings cut away , left to feel the comforting pain of solitude once more ~ -MVA 
Kicking ass on Modern Warfare2 with Renan and < PROPMALE > :P 
Upon one side , they sang songs of carved idol and < PROPMALE > ; upon the other , the roar of wolves and snowdrift Nords . Though oceans apart , they each fought the tyrant's grasp of crux domine ... From whence came this man and woman , no one knows . Their legacy , though , is one in the making . For in each step he takes , he honors father and mother ; echoing the unsung beauty of their mixed blood . 
Though it may not seem , I am searching for her . Who she is , I do not yet know ; but I feel that somewhere , she lies in wait ~ Perhaps she lives far away in a time not yet come ... Or perhaps she's been beside me all along . Only time shall reveal to me ~ 
There comes a time when a man must abandon well-meaning words , pick up a rifle or an axe , and take things into his own hands ; lest his household and his life fall by the wayside ~ The same intent works in modern times ... Pick your head up and firm your shoulders for the battle ahead ; because those who lay around don't build empires , mate .

Life is like a hellish train ride - every time that screeching beast of steel rides into another darkened tunnel , you don't know where the fuck you'll wind up next ; so hold on tight , face the beast , and never jump off ! 
I turn 18 in 1-hour . Oh , joy :P 
Time to take the SAT . >_> Walking to Kearny High at 6 in the morning to take the test , wish me luck lol 
Hmm , that was easy . Oh , by the way , my apartment is flooded again ! There goes 2 guitars , half of my clothes , my computer , and my entire floor . Damn rainstorm , lol 
New poem :) http://maximilian-aurea.deviantart.com/art/Wherein-Lies-The-Beast-157534084 
Charger burned out , no internet access indefinitely . Fuck . 
Still no internet . Blah . 
Lmao , ESH the concert was ... Interesting . Can't wait ' til we start recording the CD , :) 
Goodbye Highschool , hello future ; I wonder what mysteries you hold in store for us all ~ 
Going to Brazil tomorrow :) See you all in a few weeks ! Sorry if I can't call anyone lately , my cell phone broke ~ Keep in contact , eh ? 
Surgery didnt go so well , hemmorhaging isnt very fun , but Im okay now ... Stuck in bed for 2 weeks , bored out of my damn mind . Thought its about time I said something , now that theres no reason for anyone to worry . :) See you guys soon , Ill be heading back to the US on the 28th , 23rd was too early for me to travel with the surgery fresh . Bye ! 
Sorry if Ive disappeared , all . I should be coming back from Brazil on the 27th , and once Ive healed enough to walk , Ill definitely visit people and < PROPFEMALE > out with you all :) Phones broken so I cant call anyone , Ill be asking for < PROPFIRST > once I get a new one , haha ~ \ 
\ 
Love you all , my friends ; may fortune shine upon you , and the winds of fate guide you through life with happiness , health , and success :D 
Apparently an international 18hr trip to the USA is a bad idea , my doctor advised me to cancel my trip and reschedule ... So , if all goes well , I should be back in the country on Monday the 9th , around early afternoon . :) 
Tagged a bunch of hilarious and nice pictures from High School Prom+Grad , some older pics from before , and newer pics from after . First update Ive made to FB in months , never on here lol . Enjoy ~ 
I miss you guys :) Ill be back in the US on Monday ! Send me your < PROPFIRST > by msg , Im getting a new phone , lost everyones < PROPFIRST > ! 
I found my old pictures from when I was a baby , and growing up . Pictures of Mom , Marcio , even one of Steph :) Uploading a ton of them , and bringing my father's military medals back home with me , as well as his flag , his paintings , and other stuff . I miss him a lot ... Good times . 
I must have uploaded at least 150 pics in the last 24hrs , haha :) Wish I could upload them all ... This is my last sign-on across the world . Next time I get bored to the point where Im desperate enough to go on FB , Ill be in the USA :D Cheers , mates , see you all Monday and thereafter . Oh , btw , check out my pictures haha :) 
Officially in my new place :) Its so peaceful to live alone now ... Lonely , but peaceful . I've got a wonderful nighttime breeze coming in , and am sitting on my couch in the dark , listening to the far-away sounds of the city ... Couldn't be happier :) 
My phone is now 95% destroyed . I cant send or receive texts , use my alarm , go online , much less see the screen at all , it doesn't vibrate , it rings only on the last ring when the person hangs up and for only half a second , and now I can't call anyone ; my numberpad stopped working , meaning I can't make calls . \ 
Fuck you , phone . Fuck you . The d ... ay my contract ends , on SEPT 29th , I'm setting this thing on fire . See More 
I'm trapped at work , lol . My front door is covered in water , as is the entire corner , hahaha . Me and the secretaries are stuck inside , there's 4 guys standing on what's left of our steps and everyones beeping , etc . This is ridiculous LOL . 
A new day is dawned ; The hallowed < PROPFEMALE > is hidden , and early morning calls . As chirping birds < PROPFEMALE > through the barren streets , a single life - and then another - begins their ascent . Some go to their future ; others , to their past . But each lives within a Present of possibilities most infinite . -Me(Being random )

Labor day weekend ! I don't work saturday and monday . :) Freedom ! Haha ! Work Monday - Saturday from 9 AM - 6 PM ~ 
HEY , If you live on the planet Earth , in \ 
Newark , know someone who's from the area , or care at all about where you\ 
live , regardless of where you're from , please read this . I'm done \ 
putting up with the bs , so I decided to do&say something about it . Please check it out : http://gjstruck.wordpress.com/ 
Thanks for listening , guys :) We've had 130 visitors and counting , and hopefully at least some of them are going to do something interesting . Hey , if even 5 people decide to do something nice to help the environment , their city , etc , then I'm happy . I'm going to be writing on other topics regularly , whenever I've got something on my mind . Stop by sometime and give me a shout ;) http://gjstruck.wordpress.com/ 
RIP all those we lost , that fateful day of September 11th ; if only the togetherness that time brought to < PROPFEMALE > hadn't been lost to petty arguments and bs . Where's the unity now , < PROPFEMALE > ? Does it really take a catastrophic event to remind us that our neighbor is just as human as we are ? Think about what it means to be < PROPFEMALE > n , to be HUMAN . Bring change to your life , and your life will bring change to the world ~ 
Randomly listening to music and singing along to Phantom of the Opera . Damn it , I don't see myself sleeping any time soon . Work's going to suck tomorrow ... Thank the gods that its just 4 hours instead of the usual 9 hours of work . I love you , saturday . Not as much as sunday though . Sorry . :P 
Randomly wrote a song out of nowhere . Here ya go . Be gentle , I haven't practiced in ... However many months its been since June , lol . \ 
Read the info for an explanation + lyrics , lol . I'll be uploading the edited version once I actually get some sleep and eventually decide to work on it . Thanks ! \

Goodbye work , hello weekend . Going home now to relax ; I'll be free today if anyone wants to < PROPFEMALE > out n Newark/Harrison/Kearny . Tomorrow I've got plans with my fiance , so get to me today , or I'll be seeing you next weekend :) 
That's the second time this month I nearly got robbed by 5 random black guys . When will this bullshit end ? \ 
Do you really have nothing better to do than to harass people who actually have a life ? Way to show just how pathetic you are . \ 
Sad part is , the first time I recognized two as East Side graduates from before I graduated there . Nice to see what you've accomplished with your life , asshole . \ 
Grow a pair of balls . 
Man , I'm so bored . I'm researching South African geography & Meerkat societal patterns(for an anthropomorphic race in my Fantasy novels ) , Nazi-SS symbolism(For info pertaining to cultural & spiritual , and well as hierarchic details for one of my novel's evil empires ) , and other random ideas . \ 
Any random suggestions for other stuff ? :P

Debating whether I should get a new number , or transfer my old one . Sprint contracts dies tomorrow , and so begins the life of my new iPhone . Hmm ... 
Anyone know a good heart doctor in the Newark area ? Someone I know is very sick and I need to take them to the doctor ... They don't really have anyone else who can do it for them . Any information would be appreciated ... Thanks . 
\Our spirits were forged in snow and ice 
Got my new phone ! Message me for my number :) 
I start the course to get my Insurance Agent&Broker licensing tomorrow , and its also my anniversary . :) Perhaps I'll be able to celebrate and be happy , and counteract this horrific week I've had . May our next years be even better than those since past , and the years after those better still ! \ 
Blessings to all , and may each of you have a wonderful weekend :) 
Taking Kiki to the hospital , be back in a few hours . This is going to be fun ( venomous sarcasm ) If they < PROPMALE > me around like they did when Mom had cancer , I'm throwing a shit-fit until they do their damn job , I'm sick and tired of University being a bunch of lazy b'tards and leaving me bleeding in the emergency room for 3-8 hours . 
Is it truly so difficult for people to grow up , accept their mistakes , and be adults ? The\ 
level of immaturity in my generation is sickening ; I am beyond tired of\ 
dealing with people's bullshit , stupidity , and deceit . \ 
Be clear with your words , and honest about your intentions , or disappear . Its disgraceful how some people can be so god-damned two-faced . \ 
This isn't grade school anymore , people . Grow the hell up . 
Why is it that I am so nice ? I miss being the authorative asshole I once was . Am I really down to letting my own employee talk exagerated shit about me without so much as defending myself ? Doubly so considering I foolishly decided to spare her the stress of my anger , since its her last week here ? 
\Her self-inflicted brutality etched unseen scars upon her\ 
Why is it that the ignorant , hateful , sexist , racist , arrogant , deceitful and disrespectful are always the first to rant and complain about how ignorant , hateful , deceitful , arrogant and disrespectful everyone ELSE is ? \ 
Sometimes , Humanity sickens me . There truly is no shame ... 
The soil bleeds for us all , vomiting back the rotting corpses of the damned , as if protesting the very presence of humanity within its earthly confines . Maggots stir within the flesh , consuming what long ago was forsaken . Shrieking specters < PROPFEMALE > the sky , screaming into the void of black ; the violent inception of light threatens to overcome my shattered senses . Is this what we fought so defiantly for ? 
This is my solemn protest against all crimes against humanity , \ 
uttered in secret pact , and brought forth from within the darkened\ 
confines of the human soul . \ 
 Where lies Freedom now ? \

Thank you , < PROPFEMALE > ! Finally , a triple-dose of fortunate awesomeness hits me :D \ 
I caught an awesome economic break , got hit with an awesome business opportunity , and repaired some < PROPMALE > issues in my personal life . \ 
Time to make this an even better week :D 
Me and < PROPFIRST > are on a Linkin Park and Eminem binge , lol ... Oh man . My childhood's flashing back . So many memories ... The few good times made all the bullshit worth living .

Blessed Veteran's Day , my friends . May we honor the memory of all those who fought in the name of freedom , the men and women who are at this moment still fighting for our rights , and especially so for those who lost or gave a part of themselves along the Path of Liberty . \ 
< PROPFIRST > R . Struck , < PROPFIRST > Struck , and so many thousands more , you shall never be forgotten . 
Seriously , what the fuck is wrong with people ? One of my cousins totally snapped and beat the shit out of my mother , had to be physically restrained , broke free , did it again , and had to be pinned down by multiple people . Are people going insane , with all these killings , attacks , thefts , and rapes lately ? \ 
... Its the drinking water , I tell you ... 
As trees lay bare , and leaves blow by , \ 
Snow falls : I can feel the change upon us . \ 
A full years gone by , \

As < PROPFEMALE > is bathed in < PROPFEMALE > light ;\

Where , I bellow toward the heavens , is Winter's snow ? Though Summer's end is long since past , Fall seems to linger well past its due . Should Winter not rise from its slumber and give rise to mountainous snow , Spring shall soon overthrow him and take his seat as Lord of the season .

... My fiance gave me a haircut today . o_O I'm not sure whether to be glad that it turned out alright , or afraid of the prospect of her with scizzors near me once or twice a month . Lmao . 
Dropped my iPhone into the toilet . Yep . At least it was clean , lol . Remind me never to put my phone in shallow dress-pants pockets and bend over to pick up febreeze . \

To be the truest friend , there comes a time when you must risk that friendship in order to do what's best for them . I am free of doubt , and regret . When you truly love somebody , you've got to do what's best for them , even if it hurts you in the end . But again , my pain shall pass , and we shall move forward . Perhaps in different directions , but forward nonetheless . I swear one thing ; you'll never be forgotten . 
Anyone know any NJ-based poetry organizations/contests/etc ? o_O I can't seem to find anything that's not halfway across the tri-state area in the middle of nowhere .

Fawk yeah ~ 
You shall never live in darkness again , as long as your inextinguishable inner light yet burns . \ 
Fear not , for you too shall break free from your suffering . \ 
Our pain is fleeting , just as scars and memories may fade ;\ 
The light is ever-present , only clouded by our unseeing eyes\ 
Look upon the face you see within the mirror ; they shall NEVER lie broken again . \

Has anyone else read about the purposed Internet Kill-Switch legislation currently being look at ? Are you fucking kidding me ? Giving the government the power to shut off ALL INTERNET IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY , AT THEIR WHIM ? Hello , Fascism . 
We are all gods here ; inherently capable of instigating metamorphosis and revolution within the fractured systems of oppression which bind the individual's supreme reality .

Shit . My Insurance exam in about 15 hours . 4 hour , 250 question exam in complex legal terminology about even more confusing legal situations and laws . Hand me my sword and pray to Odin , ' cause I'm warring this one out tonight . 
My dear best friend and sister < PROPFEMALE > Correia is currently at the hospital watching over her father who went into cardiac arrest today and is in critical condition at the hospital . I'd appreciate if our friends would offer their love and their prayers so that he may recover quickly and safely ... Much love , my friends . 
Taking < PROPFIRST > to the hospital ; constant fever , throwing up , extreme stomach and muscle pain , paleness , dry mouth and lips , dizzy , etc ... This is such an entertaining week , I must say . I'm still expecting a third piece of bad news to hit me sometime . They usually come in threes , sadly . Not in a good mood or I'd laugh at the irony . 
I'm 19 in 3 minutes . Hmm , I don't feel any different . If anything , I feel worse . lol . Two years to go until I have nothing left to look forward to , lmao

Anyone know of a good 1-bedroom apartment somewhere in the Newark/Harrison area ? I love my landlord but I hate my building , I'm getting tired of getting flooded whenever it rains , among other things 
I have a personal reason for asking if everyone could please put this as their status for one hour . I know my family and my friends will . Think of someone you know or love who has or had cancer . My prayer is that I hope a cure will be found . There are too many to mention who have fought and are fighting it . I hope to see this in the status of all my friends . Love & Thanks ~

Japanese culture trumps American culture in so many ways ... Every disaster or issue and everyone complains to and about the government , everyone mooches , steals , loots , lies , and bitches , and society crashes down constantly . There is no loyalty or respect here , and everyone tends to care for themselves and no one else . Our people need to grow some balls ...

WARNING : Multiple female friends of mine , mostly in the 16-19 yr range , have been getting stalked and followed by older men here in Newark , one of which just followed someone I know a few blocks , turned a hard u-turn , waited for her , when she got scared and ran , drove after her , looked for her , found her hiding , went after her , so on and so forth ... She's safe now , but this shit is ridiculous . 
Collapsed walking back to work from my lunch ... Nauseous as all hell and throwing up again ... Dunno what's wrong with me , but its getting worse , and the migraines , acid reflux , chest/abdominal pains , and fatigue along with it . Fuck . 
Just got back from the hospital ... Apparently its an intestinal blockage , taking meds for it , didn't need surgery . They couldn't figure out what the other stuff was so they just released me . Three sarcastic huzzahs for the shitty American medical system !
