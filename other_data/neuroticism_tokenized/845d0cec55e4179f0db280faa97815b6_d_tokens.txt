Dear Lord , I'm asking you to watch over my friend while he is going through a rough time and pay attention to his great grandpa and make sure that he makes it through the night . I pray that everything will get better and that tomorrow will be better . If anything just watch over them and give them strength and hope . I pray that you will make them both stronger in this night . I love you . Amen <3 
Everyday people are going through rough times and are in pain . You have to be strong & think positive even though you dont think it will work , its something you do to make things better . Tomorrow im going with my mom to see her results , i hope and pray everything is ok and its nothing too serious . So today im trying to be strong and positive for her . I love you mommie <3 
today is just one of those days =/ im rather upset and im still trying to be strong .... nervous about hearing the results tomorrow :( 
Today is gonna be a long day =/ I'm gonna think positive and know that everything will be just fine . Doctor's appointment afterschool with mommie ! <3 
long day ! good and bad news i guess .... idk just wish this day would end already :'( 
Gosh I hope that tomorrow is a better day because days like today just make me wanna run away and get away from everything ! But tomorrow will be a better day with smiles and happiness :) <3 
Today didnt go as well as I hoped ... things happen and you cant control what happens all of the time , im just lucky to have my best friends who are always there for me and let me cry on their shoulder when its needed :) I love youuu ! <3

Just lose control and let your body give in , \

Of your heart as my hand touches your skin , \

You just have to move forward and work past these little bumps along your life . Life comes with the goood and the bad , you just have to have the strength to get by the bad things and continue with your life . 
Today is a new day .!! Gonna put a smile on my face :)

I make mistakes , I am sometimes out of control and at times hard to handle . But if you can't handle me at my worst then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best . If you're a bitch repost this . 
Stressed out because only 2 more days until grades go in . Just gotta keep my head held up high and just smile . 
If you have something to tell someone that came from my mouth , make sure its the correct freaking shit I said and if you have a problem with what I said , come and ask me , dont start shit with me becuz ill be your worst freaking nightmare . 
Make myself some dinner , cleanup , work on homework , take a shower , then more homework . What a wonderful night ... Thank goodness tomorrow is our last day :)

Everything happens for a reason , people change so that you can learn to let go , things go wrong so you can appreciate them when they're right , and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can come together . - < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > <3 
Well hopefully when I wake up everything will be better .. going to sleep .!! nitey nite and sweet dreams <3 
Gonna lay in the sun .!! 
Sometimes in life things happen that you have no control over . Its your job to be the strongest person and fight for what you believe . Remember to smile because no one wants to see your frown , your way more beauitful when you smile . Always live your life , love the ones in it , and laugh everyday <3 
When everything seems just like its going goood , something always has to happen and it sucks . I wish life was different :(

I love the rain !! I wish i could go outside and sit in the rain right now , so this crappy day would be washed away and i would feel better =/

What a crappy night .. :'( 
Looks like ill be up all night finishing this essay . Hopefully tomorrow is a better day ... =/ 
Live life fully while you're here . Experience everything . Take care of yourself and your friends . Have fun , be crazy , be weird . Go out and screw up ! You're going to anyway , so you might as well enjoy the process . Take the opportunity to learn from your mistakes : find the cause of your problem and eliminate it . Don't try to be perfect ; just be an excellent example of being human . - < PROPFIRST > Robbins 
All I have to say is that if your gonna mess with me , you better expect me to come back right at you . Two can play your little game and in the end ill win . So you wanna play dirty , bring it on ... im done being nice . 
Here it goes .... Tbh <------ Like it :)

When it comes right to life , its just something everyone goes through . U will be loved by the special someone . U will get heartbroken along the way . U will be happy . U will be sad . U will be stepped on by anyone who thinks your weak . U have to move on from these things and shine through those dark clouds . People come into your life and leave your life for a reason . Love everyday ? 
Ugh . I'm soooo awake . And I'm soooooo bored lol .
