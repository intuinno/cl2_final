Hey , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > , it has been quite some time since Ive seen you . According to my dad you two took a picture together when you came down a little while ago . You told him you would be posting it so he's been bugging me for the past three weeks asking if you have posted up the picture ... So , whenever you have the time could you please post the picture so my dad is satisfied ? Thank You (: 
? The sky is the limit but I just want to float , free as a spirit on a journey on home . Cut the strings and let me go I'm weightless weightless . Billions of balloons tethered to the ground weight of the world tries to hold us down , cut the strings and let me go I'm weightless weightless ?

Remember to spring your clocks forward an hour !!! 
We all bleed red , we all taste rain , we all fall down , lose our way\ 
We all say words we regret , we all cry tears , we all bleed red\ 
Sometimes we’re strong , sometimes we’re weak , sometimes we’re hurt and it cuts deep\ 
We live this life , breath to breath , we’re all the same ; we all bleed red ...
