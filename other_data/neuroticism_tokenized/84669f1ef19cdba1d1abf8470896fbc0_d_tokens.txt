care of you , would do anything for you , who makes you laugh , who \

men are few & far between & I'm blessed to have one 
Love is like a friendship caught on fire . In the beginning a flame , very pretty , often hot and fierce , but still only light and flickering . As love grows older , our hearts mature and our love becomes as coals , deep-burning and unquenchable . ~ Bruce < PROPFIRST >

Hangin ' out with the family . Wondering why we all have to live so far apart . =( 
A mother is the truest friend we have , when trials heavy and sudden , fall upon us ; when adversity takes the place of prosperity ; when friends who rejoice with us in our sunshine desert us ; when trouble thickens around us , still will she cling to us , and endeavor by her kind precepts and counsels to dissipate the clouds ... of darkness , and cause peace to return to our hearts . ~ Washington < PROPMALE > 
Happy Birthday to my brothers Semper Fi !!! 
.. at the pediatrician's office AGAIN getting another inhaler prescription for Jaden because his father doesn't want to give up the inhaler we picked up 3 weeks ago . 
And now I've been waiting over an hour for him to drop off my son . It's been the same time for the past 2 months . He must've came down with a sudden case of amnesia .

YOUR\ 
SON WILL HOLD YOUR HAND FOR ONLY A LITTLE WHILE , BUT WILL HOLD YOUR \ 
HEART FOR A LIFETIME . ITS SON'S WEEK . IF YOU HAVE A SON THAT MAKES YOUR \ 
LIFE WORTH LIVING BY JUST BEING AROUND THEM , AND IF YOU'RE PROUD OF YOUR\ 
SON , copy and paste !

Our children's education takes a back seat . Homeless go without eating . Elderly go without needed medicines . Mentally ill go without treatment . Troops go without the proper equipment . Veterans go without benefits that were promised to them !!! Yet we donate millions of dollars to other countries before helping our own first ! 
Hope you have a safe evening to everybody who's crazy enough to be on the road tonight ( ahem-us ! ) . Hope the Good Lord brings everyone home safe . 
Is anyone going to the Cozy Corner tonight ?

OMG someone stabbed a 9-mo old puppy 50 times , leaving it to wander the streets and die in some bushes off of Rosecranz Saturday morning .

Animal or not , that's still a young , helpless , live creature !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! </3 Staus ? Devastated . 
We Wish You A < PROPFEMALE > Christmas 
God saw you getting tired and a cure was not to be . So he put his arms around you and whispered come with me . With tearful eyes we watched and saw you pass away . Although we love you dearly we could not make you stay . A < PROPFEMALE > heart stopped beating , hard working hands at rest . God broke our hearts to prove to us , he only takes the best . Put as your status if there is someone in Heaven you will miss this Christmas ?
