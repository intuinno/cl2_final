Rev . < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is leaving First UU Church of Richmond , and a party is being held in her honor on August 2 . I RSVPed on the Facebook entity of this event that I was coming , but I see no button that says submit or anything like that . Nevertheless , 
Big storm coming our way - seems to be headed up the Appomattox , as though that were Storm River . 
We need a celestial broom to sweep the clouds away at SUUSI . 
Last night at a slow night at the Serendipity dance scene at SUUSI , aliens from Planet ? came in and suddenly the whole place came alive ! 
Eclipse yesterday in < PROPFEMALE > , the longest in the 21th Century . It is part of Saros 136 , an 18 yr 10 1/3 day period in which nearly identical eclipses repeat . I saw the previous eclipse of this cycle , 1991 July 11 , in < PROPMALE > , Mexico near Cabo San < PROPMALE > . 
SUUSI 2009 ! Stargazing tonight . One of the clearest nights ever for this event , despite flashing lightning to the south . We saw M57 ( ring nebula ) , M13 ( great Hercules cluster ) , M81 , M82 , M51 ( galaxies ) , Lagoon Nebula , double cluster in Perseus , M31 ( Andro

Skywatch last night at Swift Creek Middle School , Midlothian , VA . Good night despite summer haze , blazing lights , and a full < PROPFEMALE > . We saw an Iridium Flare , a satellite , Jupiter , and a Saturn without rings . The satellite crossed in front of Jupiter . 
Interesting polls on CNN . I came on late and voted F for congressional Republicans and the media and B+ for Obama . Obama got C- overall , even though only 7% ( least of all the grades ) voted C . The big ones were A and F . Also interesting is , using modes , that the entire country voted F for Obama , but Facebook users voted A , even though the distributions were similar . There's a huge split in our country . 
The weather models now say that this storm off the African coast , now called Invest 90L , will miss the Atlantic coast and be a fish spinner - i.e. , it spins the fish around . Still needs to be watched . 
Surprise ! A new tropical system has appeared , this time near Tampa , FL . Given the bathwater in the Gulf of Mexico , this will develop into a strong tropical storm before it strikes the Gulf Coast . So now there are three storms out there . It looks like < PROPMALE > will miss the East Coast and < PROPFEMALE > will < PROPFIRST > out . 
Here comes Hurricane < PROPMALE > . It arrives off the coast tomorrow . Where's Hurricane < PROPFEMALE > ? 
A minor cold-front storm , magnified to severe thunderstorm status by moisture from Hurricane < PROPMALE > , barreled through here , knocking down our cardinal flag . Hope those folks in Massachusetts and the Canadian Maritimes make it through the storm OK . 
They are bringing up Pluto's nonplanethood up again : http://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/space/08/24/pluto.dwarf.planet/ . I think the best definition of a planet is 200 yottagrams . This means eight planets . Mercury is 330 yottagrams and is a planet . Ganymede is 147 yottagrams and is not a planet . Pluto is a mere 13 yottagrams , smaller than our < PROPFEMALE > at about 70 yottagrams . 
Senator < PROPMALE > Kennedy has died . Of course there is the usual hype about him all over the media , like there was for < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . Let's hope this hype means a greater < PROPMALE > that the health reform legislation that he fought for years for gets passed . There may be no better way to celebrate his legacy than to do just that . 
The wildfires in California are really something . They are easily visible on visible satellite maps , as far east as Colorado . A picture in today's Richmond Times-Dispatch of Los < PROPFEMALE > looks like something out of an apocalypse movie from nearby Hollywood : http://www.twincities.com/ci_13242630 . 
No one should die because they cannot afford health care , and no one should go broke because they get sick . Support Obama's health plan . 
OK , here is a point in favor of all of you neocons , Republicans and conservatives . Creigh Deeds just put a computer call on my phone . I find them unacceptable because you don't get a < PROPMALE > to reply . The score is now Deeds 1 , McDonnell 0 , for < PROPFEMALE > governor . I will still vote for Deeds , because I generally support his and Obama's policies . However , Deeds needs to stop these calls . 
Looks like yesterday was my birthday - in the Muslim calendar . This calendar puts two extra years on my age . Furthermore , my birthday was Ramadan 15 . So I just note it as a little anecdote . My religious faith ( Unitarian Universalism ) believes in the viability of all traditions - Christian , Jewish , Muslim , Buddhist , Hindu , scientific , agnostic and others . 
Come to the < PROPFEMALE > Club meeting this Wednesday at the Science Museum of < PROPFEMALE > at 7 pm , to see two informative talks on Peak Oil by < PROPFIRST > Zeigler and < PROPMALE > Whipple . This important problem , that cheap oil is running out , does not get much press but it is a bigger problem than health care or the budget deficit - in fact , Peak Oil caused the deficit to go up . 
I just saw Obama's speech on TV . Why all the objection to it ? Some of his messages are get the education you need now ; everyone's good at something ; not everyone can be a rock < PROPFEMALE > , but you can find something that you are good in . If the objectors to this speech , those who don't want to show it at school object to this , then they object to the basic objectives of education . Is that indoctrination ? 
If you are in the Richmond-Petersburg area , please consider coming to the Science Museum of < PROPFEMALE > for the < PROPFEMALE > Club meeting on Peak oil , recording Obama's address on TV and watching it later . Peak oil is an important message , and there will be two good speakers . 
They just footballed out the Channel 12 ( Richmond , VA ) 11 o'clock news tonight , along with Channel 12's Restaurant Report . I therefore predict that sometime this week , someone at some Richmond area restaurant is going to get sick . 
September 11 is nearing an end . It was 80 degrees ; I mulched several trees and shrubs in my yard . 26 years ago the temperature was 100 degrees - the latest that a 100+ temperature has ever occurred in Richmond , VA . On that day , I ran 6 < PROPMALE > in the 100-degree heat , training for the Richmond Newspapers Marathon in 1983 . 
The Creigh Deeds camp sent me an email telling me what he would do on the economy , energy , schools and so forth . I replied that he did not discuss Peak Oil , the biggest problem of our time . Someone in the Deeds camp came up with the idea that I was volunteering for his campaign . I said nothing of the sort . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > just said that racism may be part of the opposition to Obama's health plan ; in particular , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE>'s remark . It's hard to show he's wrong - there are hardly any blacks in these \tea parties\ " . I think < PROPMALE > has a point . What do you think ? " 
Once again the media is harping on a single murder , that of < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > . There are about 16,000 single murders every year in the US , so making any a national story tells us that there is no worth in the other 16,000 . It is solely media hype . They are better off talking about health care reform , Afghanistan , the state of the economy , or peak oil . 
Six years ago today , Hurricane < PROPFEMALE > struck the Richmond area . It was the worst hurricane I have ever experienced . It caused a one-day power outage ( for some an entire week ) , two trees to fall on our property , and disruption of my workplace for about a week . Fortunately there is nothing like that out there now in the tropics . 
Halloween's coming . Here I am in costume at a Halloween party 3 years ago . 
Longwood University and Farmville , VA , have been rocked by a quadruple murder . Now if the murder of one person at Yale deserves a lot of national media attention , then surely these Farmville murders should . But I have not heard as of yet one peep out of any of the national nutworks about the Farmville murders . They are using strange math . 1 murder is a bigger story than 4 . 1 is greater than 4 . 
It's official . The Connecticut Defenders are coming to Richmond , VA . There is a contest for the name of this AA baseball team . What would you like to see as a name for the new Richmond club ? 
I just got a call from a Verizon Wireless agent . She kept insisting that I give up my iPhone and go for one of her offers . She would not listen to me when I said you can't use an iPhone with Verizon and that I will come back if and ONLY if it becomes possible to use an iPhone with Verizon . She weakened the case for my turning back to Verizon if and when that happens with her attitude . 
What is your < PROPFEMALE > ? This is a < PROPFEMALE > that is the same distance in light-years from the Earth as your age . Therefore , the light you see from the < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > ted leaving the < PROPFEMALE > when you were born . Mine is Beta Pictoris , since it is 63 light years away , and I am 63 years old . For a child that just turned 4 a couple of months ago , it would be < PROPFEMALE > Centauri . What's yours ? ( Google \* is [ your age ] light years away \".)" 
Last day for the name the Richmond baseball team contest . You need to have your entry in by 5 pm today ( 2009/09/30 ) . I think I submitted the best possibilities . Others are Breeze , Martins , Byrds , Rockets , Rocks , Mammoths and Ponies , the last name after the Pony Pasture . Martins may be good but I will go with Richmond Sliders , naming the team after a baseball pitch and thus opposing the Altoona Curve . 
My dentist sent me a $800 < PROPMALE > for a crown . Insurance would not pay for it , which is ridiculous since they pay for lesser dental procedures and for other minor medical costs . This states the case for health care reform . We need the government to step in and straighten this out by paying at least some of this cost . Many people can't afford $800 . 
I see there is an article in the Richmond TD about naming the new baseball team . The team's owner likes Rapids but does not like Ravens because of the Baltimore team . Hey , that's FOOTBALL , not baseball ! Seven other names were listed . Razmatazz - shorten that to Razz . Radicals - symbol on uniforms would be a square root sign or a peace symbol . Rain - when team takes to field , umpire calls the came on account of Rain . 
Obama could lose my vote in 2012 if he does not do something that I was hoping he would do when I voted for him . That is , get out of Afghanistan . We are not successful in getting Osama and we are trying to prop a regime against an opposition , as in Vietnam . It is costing us lives and billions of dollars . 
The new Richmond baseball club has issued its five choices . They are terrible . The choices are Flatheads ( Skinheads ? ) , Flying Squirrels ( why flying ? ) , Hambones ( poor diet ) , Rock Hoppers ( sounds like grasshoppers ) , and Rhinos . Comments to the Times-Dispatch article are highly negative . Rhino is the only good one - it's a subanagram of Richmond , so that the Rhino Cmd . anagrams to Richmond . 
Well this gives us a < PROPMALE > to put in a better name . I don't know if you've heard of peak oil , that the supply of oil sooner or later will not be able to meet demand . I think we are having Peak Baseball Team Names . Team names are non-renewable because teams gobble them up then put name-tyrannic trademarks on them so no one else can get them . 
Hush Puppies ?? As a name for Richmond's baseball team ? That's the sixth choice . That's worse than the first five . Some say the owners are trying to force Rhinos on us . If so , we need to defy them . So I am leaning to voting for Flying Squirrels , which I hope will be shortened to Squirrels . 
The score is now Creigh Deeds 2 , < PROPMALE > McDonnell 0 . Tonight I got a computer call from the Deeds campaign at 6:30 pm . We don't do that , not with something that rings in your face . I will still vote for Creigh , but I now prefer him only moderately over McDonnell and I don't blame anyone who votes for McDonnell because of Deed's computer calls . 
It's a muggy 75 degrees here in Richmond with 70 dew point ; the temperature never went below about 73 . What month is it ? October ! Not July . It's still summer . But that will go soon . A cold front will push the temperature back into the 60s later today . 
What's this with winter weather ? The Canadian north had been covered with snow , but now the snow and ice maps show snow all over the place in western Canada and US , as far south as NW Kansas . This should warm up , it being October , but with all that snow around , the warmth of the sun may reflect into space and perpetuate the cold . 
A friend just sent me an email quoting traffic services , in which the sender says \ ... when you're tooling down the highway\ " . Can't he be more specific ? Was he hammering down the highway ? ( especially after hitting the road ? ) . Was he chiseling down the highway ? Or leveling the highway ? I am not sure such user-initiated road \ " maintenance\ " would be appreciated by the official maintainers . " 
People are saying the government is spending too much . Here's an idea to save some money . Eliminate < PROPMALE > Day ! It is the least important of the 10 official Federal holidays . Not too many celebrate the discovery of the New World , and there are some groups ( e.g. , Native Americans ) who are offended by it . 
We have had 6 Comcast internet outages today , plus we had outages the past three days , including a massive 9-hour outage yesterday . It just goes to prove my assertion that Comcastic means unreliable . 
The Heenes did the balloon stunt to get publicity and a superstar image . So what are the nutworks doing ? They are harping on this balloon story all over the place , giving the Heenes what they want . I think they should right now make appropriate use of a sharp needle and pop the story off the TV . 
Well now that Richmond's baseball team is the Flying Squirrels , someone has suggested the < PROPFEMALE > be renamed the Nuthouse . Also , since these squirrels actually fly , when a Flying Squirrel hits a fly ball that's caught , we need to use \flew\ " as the past tense of \ " fly\ " instead of \ " flied\ " : < PROPFIRST > Smith flew to the center fielder ( not \ " flied to the center fielder \") . " 
The computer call score for the upcoming < PROPFEMALE > gubernatorial contest : Creigh Deeds 4 , < PROPMALE > McDonnell 2 . I got two such calls from the Deeds camp yesterday . I am not sure if these are computer , and fortunately I was away when two Deeds calls came yesterday . But it doesn't matter . It doesn't matter if I am home or not . I can track you politicos down anyway with Google and other Internet services . 
First it was Twitter , then it was Facebook . Now YouTube is on the < PROPMALE > . 
There should be a hymn at the First Unitarian Universalist Church of Richmond entitled \How Can I Keep From Ringing\ " . That might work better than all the \ " turn off your cell phone\ " admonitions that we get . Tune of \ " How Can I Keep From Singing\ " ( #108 ) " 
I just joined 350.org, a climate change action group . The 350 probably refers to 350 ppm CO2 in the atmosphere , but the name also suggests incompleteness , since it is just less than 360 , as in a full circle , or as in < PROPMALE > Cooper's 360 . 
Went to Daytimers Halloween party at First UU Church in Richmond dressed like you see me in my picture . That costume didn't win . My wife < PROPFEMALE > won with her Devil costume - she really looked diabolical ! 
Today isn't Halloween . This Tuesday is Halloween , when all the scary creatures come out , including ghosts , goblins , witches , Dracula , Frankenstein , McDonnell , Cuccinelli , Bolling , bats and other scary stuff . That Bolling monster will Boll you over . Or at least that's what the current polls say . 
Creigh Deeds is testing my < PROPFEMALE > . He put a computer call on my telephone just now . The score is now Deeds 5 , McDonnell 2 . I will vote for Deeds , since McDonnell is one of these ghouls that < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > sings about in Thriller , but I am not going to be happy about it . 
Halloween trick or treat in our neighborhood is pretty much over . It was a record low for our location - only 22 trick-or-treaters . The first trick-or-treater came in at 6:46 pm tonight , a little earlier than usual , and quickly we had 12 of them . Except for a group of 10 at 7:26 pm , that was it . 
I just found out that It ( as in It is raining ) is winning Game 3 of the World Series by a score of 1:20 - 0-0 . Maybe they'll start the game . 
Interesting World Series play - top of 9th , Yankee runner on first steals second , finds no one covering third , so he steals third . Two stolen bases . Has any runner ( necessarily on first ) stolen three bases to score on a single pitch ? 
The Yankees have won 3 games in the World Series , including Game 4 by the score of 7-4 . But shouldn't it be 5-4 ? In the top of the 9th , runners on 2nd and 3rd , 2 out , Posada hits to deep left . The 2nd and 3rd base runners touch home plate , but Posada is out at second for the third out . No run can score if the third out occurs in the play . So the two runners did not score , and the final score was 5-4 . 
ABC News makes you afraid to drive your car , especially if it is a Toyota . The recall trouble with Toyota is not floor mats . Some mystery device on the Toyota is causing them to accelerate to 100 mph and you can't stop them . Also look for the date oval on your tires . For example 4601 means 46th week of 2001 . If tires are more than 6 years old , they can spin off treads and cause a serious situation . 
What's happened to Wawa ?? Twice now I have tried to obtain gasoline with two different vehicles , and at two different Wawas , and the shutoff valve cut off prematurely , at 0.30 g and 6 g respectively . Did Wawa mess with their pumps ? In any case I won't be getting gasoline at Wawa for the foreseeable future . 
Now I hear that Obama will not be attending ceremonies in Germany honoring 11/9 - the day ( 1989 Nov 9 ) that the Berlin Wall fell . This to me is an important event and I think he should have attended - having < PROPFEMALE > go instead is not enough . It is a victory for freedom . 
Facebook just asked me if I wanted to switch to English ( UK ) . What gave it the idea I was British ? It is also telling me that one of my friends doesn't have a profile picture and I should help her get one . I think it is getting presumptuous . 
Did you see on WRIC today where winds from < PROPFEMALE > blew a huge tree over , tilting a pickup truck on its root bed at a 45 degree < PROPFEMALE > ? 
Has < PROPMALE > Gates read the Anarchist Cookbook ? Today at a mathematics convention , a speaker with Power Point slides tried to show one showing some partial derivatives , such as partial of F by partial of P , using the curly d ( a backwards 6 ) to denote the partial derivative . Instead , Windows played games with the font on the slides , turning the curly d's into bombs . 
I have reached 100 Facebook Friends . But quality is better than quantity . I want to interact with the first 100 and know them better more than to get another 100 Friends and reach 200 . 
Want to know who your Facebook Friends are ? Or who the Friends of one of your Friends are ? Well , you can't . At least now you can't . Every time I try to get a list of my Friends , the system comes up with an error message that they say they are trying to fix . 
Get out your heavy parkas ! It's the Day after Tomorrow ! Here is the forecast for today from NOAA : Cloudy with a 50 percent < PROPMALE > of rain showers . Highs in the upper 60s . Temperature falling to around 49 below . Southeast winds 5 to 10 mph . Wind chill values as low as 120 below . 
I went to the District 66 Toastmasters Conference today near Richmond's airport . The main point I got from today is that to get your message across to the audience , you need to boil your audience . And here's another maxim : As long as you have issues , you can't find the solution . 
The District 66 Toastmasters Conference that just past ( Nov 20-21 ) was one of my most memorable ones . Some pictures of it are at this URL : http://s971.photobucket.com/albums/ae199/jvblowers/ 
I hope that Obama's health plan addresses the absurdities that the health care providers come up with . For example , I heard of a case where a patient was recommended for hospice , implying less than six months to live , and was also prescribed an anti-depressant that takes at least six months to take full effect . 
Is there no one we can trust in government , the media , or the corporations , or maybe even parts of academia ? Take a look at these two articles : http://kunstler.com/blog/2009/11/wickedness-abides.html#more and http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/archive.html?year=2009&month=11 ( scroll to \The Manufactured Doubt Industry ... \"" 
Economic growth is a Ponzi scheme . 
With all the past failures in Afghanistan , with the latest being the Soviet Union , why does Obama want to persist in expanding that war ? 
The TV mets and NOAA tell me what the low temperature is going to be tonight . That's not what I want . I want the predicted HIGH for tonight . It is already 66 degrees . Will it go up to 70 ? And by the way I got soaking wet going out to get readings at my thermometer , electric and gas meters , and Prius . 1.63 inches and pouring . 
Is < PROPFEMALE > Governor-Elect McDonnell's wife's name < PROPFEMALE > ? 
Snow today ? I just got finshed raking the leaves . I suppose that where the leaves were hardest to get off ( on grassy area ) , the snow will stick , and on those areas where they were easy to blow off , the ground will be bare . It will look Crismassy but patchy . 
The Global Forecasting System ( GFS ) and other predicting services suggest four wintry precipitations in the next two weeks - on the 5th , 9th , 12th , and 17th of December . 
Weather Channel's web site for < PROPMALE > , VA , shows rain/snow showers for December 13 with a high of 49 and a low of 34 . How can it snow when the temperature is 49 degrees ? 
With help from a Friend , I found a new game on FB , the Kill the Facebook Game Game . See how many FB games you can kill ( hide ) . You hide them and their huge displays as my Friends play them no longer appear , and their other posts , which I want to see , appear as they are no longer pushed below the bottom . 
Since I last posted , I have killed three more Facebook games .

< PROPFIRST > the Great in 330 BCE . Arab Muslims . Genghis Khan . Timur Lung . Great Britain 1838 . Great Britain 1878 . Soviet Union 1979 . Nobody has ever successfully invaded Afghanistan . Why should the US be any different ? Obama should pull out and concentrate on more important matters such as health care and the increasing scarcity of fossil fuels ( needed to fight that war ! ) and resultant economic setbacks . 
If you want to see when all this snow will melt , use this formula . Take the high temperature , divide by 7 , then subtract 4 . That's the number of inches that will melt . Example : High 49 degrees ; 49/7 = 7 . 7-4 =3 . 3 inches of snow will melt . Less melts if it is cloudy . I derived this formula years ago from data of my own recording and data from NOAA using a least-squares fit . 
Are we going to get cool summers with fewer 95 degree days and more days like July 6 ( high 68 ) , and more snowstorms like this one in winter ? Mayon Volcano is about ready to erupt , according to scientists and Philippine officials . Will this be like Mt Pinatubo in 1991 that brightened the skies during the 1991 July 11 solar eclipse in Mexico ? 
Banks depend on economic growth to be profitable , so why not get rid of them or restructure them ? That's what < PROPMALE > Baker says : http://www.aspousa.org/index.php/2009/12/commentary-oil-economics-and-politics-a-tangled-web-of-consequences/ 
The Winter Solstice is here ! At 12:06 pm today , the Sun will be at its highest ; and this high is the lowest in the entire year , only 30 degrees . It only clears the trees by a little bit . The Sun will now get higher as it goes through Sagittarius . If you were born today , you are a Sagittarius and a Winter Solstice , which is the MIDDLE , not the beginning , of solar winter . 
It is now 12:47 pm on 2009 December 21 , the Winter Solstice . The Sun is the farthest from us , and is now headed back north .

The Bible MUST contain errors ; else I'm God ! It contradicts all over the place . Thou shalt not kill and thou shalt kill . From Jesus to < PROPFIRST > is 43 generations and it is 27 generations .

A reminder to First UU Richmond people - nothing that has food on it can be recycled ; throw these items in the trash . Wash out and get as much liquid out of plastic containers before putting in recycle . We had to throw out a large trashbagful of stuff that was in the Church's recycle containers . 
There will never be another < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . 
Ladies - all of your saying the colors of your bras on Facebook made the local news of a California TV station . 
Why did the < PROPMALE > field School Board do it tonight , namely close < PROPMALE > Middle School in spite of massive opposition ? They could have just moved 9th grade to middle school , sending 1/3 of the 9th graders to each of the three middle schools . 
New < PROPFEMALE > . New beginnings . A blue < PROPFEMALE > , with an N instead of a Bl sound . Beginning of the month in some religious calendars . Some religious holidays always occur at the same phase of the < PROPFEMALE > : Easter , a waning gibbous ; Yom Kippur , a waxing gibbous , Hanukah , a waning crescent , and Eid-al-Fitr , a new < PROPFEMALE > and then a slender waxing crescent . 
I went to the Science Museum of < PROPFEMALE > Skywatch tonight as a member of the Richmond Astronomical Society with my 8-inch SCT . Only two telescopes and one binoculars had to handle a crowd of 200 : long lines . We saw Jupiter in a leafless tree and clouds , M42 up high , and after everyone else left , I showed Mars to a handful of interested people after moving my scope to get the SMV out of the way , I was the only 1 left . 
I don't see what Facebook has against Internet Explorer 6 . Several times now , it has bombed when I have been trying to use Facebook . I then task-manager it and bring Facebook up in Safari 4 . However , the newer browser consumes more resources , causing my computer to run and run and run . 
Today is an Anagram date : the month and day are an anagram of the year : 20100120 . There are three other dates like that this year , plus maybe 2010 November 30 , which is 20101200 . 
OK , Folks . Here is the financial world's reaction to < PROPFIRST > Brown's winning Kennedy's seat : Dow Jones down 122 points . 
Two interesting stories in the news . The new iPad , which is a cross between an iPhone and a laptop . If it can do Word and Excel , OK , else the iPhone is more convenient . The other is that Facebook is becoming an essential part of the Internet , with twice as many subscribers as MySpace and 10 times as many as Twitter , which apparently is fading . 
We had a snowstorm in December and will probably have one this weekend . Hurricanes have names , so why don't snowstorms ? I note that these storms keep preventing meetings like Transition Richmond from being held . I therefore conclude that these snowstorms are Republicans , and so I am going to name the one in December McDonnell and the one this weekend Brown . 
When do you think Snowstorm Scottbrown is going to start ? The TV mets and NOAA both say we are going to get about 9 inches , mostly tomorrow . 
I think it's going to be 10 inches in < PROPMALE > . so far 2.75 in has fallen , melting to 0.24 inch precipitation . GFS says that 0.75 -1 inch of precip will fall . If I assume 0.87 inch , that works out to 10 inches . The snow-precip ratio is 11.4 inches , whch is fluffy but not exceptionally so . 
At 2010 < PROPFIRST > 30 2:45 pm in < PROPMALE > , we have had 7.3 inches of snow . The snow appears to be a bit lighter . The snow is getting heavier . In the past 6 hours we have had 4.55 inch of snow melting to 0.62 inch precip , so that is 7.3 inches of snow per inch of precipitation . It isn't fluffy any more . 
Not rain , storms , ice or snow prevents the US Postal Service from delivering . And they delivered , at 11:40 today , or earlier than about 50% of the time it delivers . The mail woman came with chains on her tires . Now if the mail can come on a snowy day like this , why can't the Richmond Times-Dispatch ? I expect to see a newspaper in my mailbox tomorrow morning . 
I just took a quiz \What's your theme song ? \ " It came up \ " Breathe ( 2 AM)\ " < PROPFEMALE > Nalick . I listened to this song . Wrong . A much better choice is \ " Imagine\ " by < PROPFIRST > Lennon . There were some questions for which my answers would be \ " none of the above \"."

Today is Groundhog Day ! Groundhog will not see his shadow ( it is cloudy ) . So an early spring . But the bigger day will be April 15 , Flying Squirrels Day . If the Flying Squirrels win the home opener , we will have an early summer . If they lose to the Punxsutawney Phillies , we will have six more weeks of late winter or early spring weather . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > today wrote an article blasting the idea that there is global warming . These global warming deniers almost never bring up the one thing that supports their cause the best - peak oil . There is simply not enough fossil fuel on this planet to cause all these global warming catastrophes . 
Sears can't repair their own merchandise ! The bulb on my Kenmore microwave went out . So I called Sears and they sent me by mail for a charge a replacement bulb . Nowhere in the instructions to the microwave does it say how to replace the bulb . So I took it into their repair facility at Southpark Mall . The technicians could not replace the bulb , so they returned it to me . Can another repair facility replace the bulb ? 
I just saw an ad on Weather Underground saying \Sarah Palin in 2012\ " . Maybe the predictions based on the Mayan calendar about what will happen on 2012 December 21 are correct . " 
At my house it snowed 2.5 inches but then the rain melted it all away and also started to melt some of last week's storm . But more snow is coming tomorrow , with lower temperatures . 
Say NO to the Superbowl !! http://www.facebook.com/?ref=home#!/group.php?gid=304532718754&ref=ts 
I noticed that one of the local weather people ( I think on WRIC ) commented on a picture of the White House . It was all white ; you could not see it because of the snow falling and the fog . So he called it a White-Out House , then realized afterwards that the phrase can be interpreted another way .

Snow , snow , and more snow . Does this mean global warming theories are false ? NO ! In fact , it is a result of global warming , which puts more moisture in the air . See the Op < PROPMALE > column in this Sunday's Baltimore Sun . 
We could have a record melt in the Arctic this summer . Normally Hudson Bay freezes up in December and stays frozen until May . But right now , in mid February , near the < PROPFEMALE > winter solstice , the bay is starting to melt ! A < PROPFEMALE > corner of < PROPFIRST > Bay on the east is melted . See http://www.natice.noaa.gov/pub/ims_gif/DATA/cursnow_usa.gif . Although Lake Erie is frozen , Lake Superior is remarkably ice-free . 
Now I find that when I go to YouTube I get more and redder alarming messages saying I need to upgrade to a more modern browser . No way am I giving up IE6 ! I am afraid that if I upgrade to IE8 my computer will slow to a crawl , new conniptions will appear , and the things I have been doing can't be done any more . 
There were two terrorist attacks on American soil the past week , and yet the media right now are harping on Tiger Woods ? Huhhh ?? CNN , CNBC , and MSNBC are all televising a statement by Tiger Woods , as though he were the President of the United States . The nutworks ' sense of priorities is warped . 
I hear about this thing where we are all supposed to wear a blue shirt tomorrow , as though < PROPFIRST > Washington wore blue shirts . I have obtained absolutely no reason , through Google or elsewhere , why we should do this . I shall therefore defy this effort by wearing a red or an orange shirt tomorrow .

It was 98 degrees this weekend here . It was 47 on Saturday and 51 on Sunday for a total of 98 degrees . Each of those days felt cold , so two of those days must feel twice as cold . I hear it could be 98 degrees this summer . If you thought winter was cold , summer will be twice as cold ! In fact , a typical summer week of 7 days will be 7 times as cold !

I see that there is a birthday in my Events list . Why do we celebrate birthdays ? You have only one birthday in a year . However , you have 364 unbirthdays in a year , so don't you get 364 times more fun by celebrating unbirthdays instead of birthdays ? 
Today is March 4 . Did you march forth today ? If so , to what or where ? 
What's this with all the Tea Parties in the US ? They are harking back to Revolution days . That was three saecula ( see http://www.fourthturning.com ) ago . I don't know if they would get such a following if they were talking about seceding from the US ( as in two saecula ago , Civil War ) or occupying parts of the District of Columbia ( as in the Bonus Army , one saeculum ago ) . Tea Partiers , you are 237 years out of date .

Recently my mother had to be taken by ambulance to the hospital . The company , Richmond Ambulance Authority ( RAA ) , now is charging her huge amounts .

One of their spokespeople in the ad , however , was < PROPFEMALE > Bündchen , the Brazilian model that signed a contract to advertise Blackglama furs , causing PETA to protest . To me their use of Bündchen partially negates their message ; animals are part of this Earth , too .

I have heard that NASA will investigate Toyota's problems . Interesting . This means that if you drive a Toyota and have the acceleration problem , your car could go into orbit ! If you see Toyotas going up in the sky , that will justify the need for NASA . And that tells us that you DO need rocket science to figure out what's wrong with Toyotas . 
Is Obama's wanting to expand oil drilling off the Atlantic coast an April Fool's joke ? He campaigned against it when running for President . He misses the real point . Oil supplies are dwindling and we need to conserve so we don't need as much oil ; maybe then we can delay drilling , which could cause environmental harm . 
Intellicast should be renamed Stupidcast this morning . Its prediction for Richmond , < PROPFEMALE > for Tuesday , April 6 , calls for a high of 91 and a 2% < PROPMALE > of snow !

Unusual storm . Cloud tops are low , torrential rain , but no thunder or lighting , and more importantly , no wind , despite a severe thunderstorm warning calling for 60 mph winds and a tornado warning to our south . Oh , now , finally we have some thunder . We had 90s earlier this week ; it is supposed to be 66 for tomorrow . Earlier I heard an airraid-type siren sound to our south . 
I'll repeat this one again . Any more guesses ? There is a < PROPMALE > league team whose farm system is so weird that its High-A affiliate's city is bigger than the < PROPMALE > league team's city , and its AA affiliate is at least twice as large as any other city in its league . What is this team ? It is not the Baltimore Orioles .

I heard a fisherman on the Gulf Coast saying that as far as the oil slick is concerned , we are all in the same boat . If he were an airline pilot , he would say we are all in the same plane . If here were a Wall Street banker , he would say we are all in the same fund . If he were a trucker , he would say we are all in the same rig . If he were a jazz musician , he would say we are all in the same riff . 
Do you think the present level of oil drilling will continue after this oil rig disaster in the Gulf of Mexico ? I say probably not , because of highly negative public opinion about it . This means sharply rising oil and gasoline prices in the near future as well as possible shortages of oil and gasoline .

Please do not give to the World Wildlife Fund . Recently in an email they showed Giséle Bündchen asking us to support a lights out campaign .

I got my Scientific American magazine .

All these politicians talk about independence from foreign oil . The BP oil spill has generated so much hoopla and hype as well as real problems such as destruction of wetlands and fishermen's livelihoods that new exploration off our coasts will be banned . This means that oil companies will drill off other places , and the US will be even more dependent on foreign oil . We need to cut our dependence on oil , period . 
Who caused the oil spill . You . That's right , YOU !! We all did by creating the demand for oil that caused BP to go out into the mile-deep ocean to get it . Cut all the off-shore oil drilling . OK . But in that case we need to ( 1 ) stop the idea that the economy will continue to grow ; ( 2 ) redesign our lives to use less oil , and ( 3 ) stop the developers and get our governing agencies to declare more land mixed-use . 
It looks like BP is doing a better job than government in handling this oil spill crisis - the Louisiana government . Their legislators have called upon us to use prayer to help stop the spill . That's right . Prayer . Only a government has the capacity to do such a nonsensical thing , especially one in a Biblebanging state . At least BP is doing what it can to plug the leak .

I just heard that the Las Vegas 51s AAA baseball team may move to Edmonton , < PROPFEMALE > , next year . That's too far out ; it will cost the Pacific Coast League big bucks . I think the 51s owner would do far better to move the team to Richmond . That would give Richmond a Toronto-affiliate AAA team , and a swap with the Nationals would give Toronto Syracuse and Richmond's new AAA Flying Squirrels the Nationals as its parent .

Several weather models show a storm in the eastern Atlantic , currently called Invest 91L , developing into a hurricane and heading some place west , with a number of models taking it into southern or central Florida .

According to Wunderground at 2010 August 7 14:00 EDT , Jur'Evec , Russia , which is 300 < PROPMALE > or so northeast of Moscow , is at 79 degrees and has light snow ! That would be welcome relief from the heat there . I wonder if the observers mistook smoke or ash particles for snow .

Right now it is 24 degrees below zero in Petersburg , < PROPFEMALE > . Or at least that is what Intellicast says : http://www.intellicast.com/Local/Weather.aspx?location=USVA0599 . That's a welcome change from 95 degree heat , even if you have to wear a parka . My iPhone says -4 . Last year , Petersburg had a similar cold spell in August , -20 or so , except at 6am one day , when all of a sudden it shot up to 118 . 
I heard about a recent meeting of the local Democratic Party that started with a prayer from a Christian minister . To me that tells me that the local Democratic party is religiously biased . Although I usually vote Democratic , this is one reason why I have rarely attended Democratic functions .

I looked at the Global Forecasting System this morning . The long distance forecast suggests we could have two hurricanes at the end of the month . Right now both are storms in western Africa . On the 16th , one will leave the coast , and by the 19th , it will start developing as it moves westward . The latest run has it hitting just north of Jacksonville on the 30th . The other one is likely to stay at sea . 
Now we have two tropical threats , one far , far away and the other right at our doorstep . A storm will form off < PROPFEMALE > the next few days , move north just off shore to < PROPFEMALE > and possibly become tropical as it heads for New England . 
If you meet Jesus Christ on the road , kill him . 
The possible hurricane I mentioned about a week or two ago from the African coast is now Tropical Storm < PROPFEMALE > . Most models have it recurving to the north , but the Global Forecasting System has it suddenly lurching to the west at about the latitude of DC , so we need to watch this one . If it were to strike the East Coast , it would be August 30 , next Monday . 
The Global Forecasting System's 2010/08/23 18Z run shows no less than SIX tropical systems , including several hurricanes ! 
Our Civilization has an overactive pituitary gland . 
A hurricane dance is about to begin on the Great Atlantic Ocean Dance Floor .

It was a nice cool day today , where one can go out and do things . But the heat is coming back . Early September will feature highs in the mid 90s - maybe higher . Lots of clear weather , too . And mandatory water restrictions are coming in two weeks - that is , if what the GFS says is true , that once again a big hot high will settle down on our region . 
I just finished listening to the parade of hurricanes as seen in the Global Forecasting System model to the tune of \Sorcerer's Apprentice \"." 
Xfinity , xfinity , xfinity ! Everywhere you go , something xfinities you : the computer , the iPhone , the TV , the billboards . Well I'll tell you xsomething . I found something xbetter than Xcomcast and its xcomcastic Xfinity , with its xfinite number of ads . I switched to FiOS . 
The equilateral triangle has formed , like the Bermuda triangle , but this one has a storm at each vertex : http://www.wunderground.com/hurricane/2010/aug26_sat.jpg 
Looks like we are in for a < PROPMALE > drought and for mandatory water restrictions . The Global Forecasting System ( 2010/08/28 00Z and 06Z ) shows absolutely no rain at all for the next 16 days . Please don't hope for rain . Look at a satellite photo of the Atlantic Ocean . You would be hoping for a hurricane . 
< PROPFIRST > Beck told a rally today that < PROPFEMALE > is turning back to God , thereby violating the First Amendment . People like him are the same ones that tell us to limit government and respect the Constitution . Many of these Tea Party who yell for limiting government don't mind it telling us what religion it is going to be , how we are to have children , and who we may marry . They aren't for limited government at all .

Today is Halloween ! It is October 31 , because Oct- means 8 ( as in octagon , octopus ) , and this is the eighth month . I can tell it's Halloween , because I saw Halloween items in < PROPFIRST>'s today , and there was a Halloween trinket in my box of tea . If you want a Halloween goblin , try Hurricane < PROPMALE > . So Trick or Treat , and Happy Halloween !

Compare Hurricane Igor ( http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=1617 ) with the spiral galaxy Messier 101 ( http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap030310.html ) . They look almost like twins but the forces that created them ( Coriolis force , atmospheric dynamics vs gravity ) are vastly different . 
Four-hour power outage last night caused by a tree hitting a power line . You don't need wind , storm , or a hurricane . 
The repeating date 10/10/10 is coming up . My aunt-in-law was born on 10/10/10 . 
The repeating date 10/10/10 is coming up . So everyone likes to schedule their events on 10/10/10 or on the preceding weekend . On that weekend I have a choice among a peak oil conference , an anti-racism conference and an astronomy conference . My choice is the astronomy conference . Strangely enough , none of these events are in 10essee .

One of my Friends asked what to do when Jehovah's Witnesses knock . Some replies : sell them stuff , egg them , get them to do your housework , play cards with them , go naked , sic the dog on them , sic the Devil on them , bless them with holy water , abolish their religion , unhere them , hate them , get them to teach you non-JW stuff . I then came up with another idea : dance with them . 
The Non-Event is on . 
I just listened to a local station saying that the Richmond baseball team's 2011 schedule is out , but the background graphic showed instead a water tower . You heard it here first . The Richmond Flying Squirrels are changing their name to the Richmond Water Towers . 
Hurricane coming . It will be called < PROPFIRST > , and will come up from the Gulf of Mexico , on or about October 2 .

Next week , we are going to have Fair weather . Not fair weather , with the accent on the weath , but Fair weather , with the accent on the Fair . I.e. , it is going to be cloudy and rainy , the weather typical of a < PROPFEMALE > State Fair . It seems that whenever the Fair is held , it rains .

In 1980 , I purchased 48,000 bytes of memory and storage for $200 for my TRS-80 . If I had wanted 320,000,000,000 bytes instead , it would have cost me $1.3 billion and I would have needed to buy a good-sized building to hold it . I now have a 320,000,000,000 -byte disk drive about the size of a deck of 3x5 cards and it cost me about $200 . How much further can this continue ? 
This is the reason why I am willing to drive to destinations instead of fly , even if they are two or three days away , as New Orleans or Albuquerque . http://kunstler.com/blog/2010/09/the-disservice-industry.html

Intellicast calls for a 1% < PROPMALE > of snow in the Richmond area on October 3 . Snow ? Most predictions are for light rain and 60s . Well maybe , but again , it seems to me it is just as likely to oobleck . Then on October 9 , it calls for occasional showers , with a cloud coverage of 0% . How can it rain from a blue sky ? Perhaps we are going to get blue oobleck . 
We had an interesting morning . First an accident in front of our house , then men from the County looking at our drainage ditches , and then a deer that galloped all over the place in our neighborhood .

Does anyone have change for a fifty ? 
Today is 10/10/10 . My aunt-in-law Gert was born on 10/10/10 . 
I've got the change for the fifty . Today is 2010/10/10 . That is a twenty and three tens , which is change for a fifty .

I read in the paper this morning that < PROPFIRST > Cantor ( US House , VA-7 ) does not want to debate his opponents < PROPMALE > Waugh ( Dem ) and < PROPMALE > Bayne ( I ) . To me that is a serious offense . I did not vote for < PROPMALE > in 1980 because of that . I urge people in this district not to vote for Cantor . If you are conservative or Republican , vote for Bayne .

What's with Facebook ? All of a sudden it wouldn't come up at all , on my computer or my iPhone . 
< PROPFIRST > Cantor sent me a really objectionable email , called You Cut , in which he asks about cutting funding for NPR . The web site he directs me to immediately plays music and talks when I go to it . No . You wait until I tell you you can play . Then it shows where you can vote on cutting NPR funding . There is only one way you can vote : YES . Does he want this country to be a rubber-stamp dictatorship ? 
Hello . 
I saw a movie on gerrymandering Friday Oct 22 at the Byrd Theatre . I got the idea while watching the movie of using telephone area codes for US Congressional districts . These would have to be modified ( 269 area codes vs 435 reps , for example ) , but the area codes were designed for communication , not politics , and they preserve communities better . Most of all redistricting would be out of politician's hands . 
< PROPFIRST > Cantor Set is totally disconnected . 
What is the Richmond Times-Dispatch trying to do ? Trying to show that they are a bad gateway or something ? In big banner headlines this morning , they announce Politifact , which is supposed to rate politicians ' statements from True to False and Pants on Fire ( although I think that specifically means a lie about sex ) . But when I go to their URL , I get \502 Bad Gateway \"." 
That must have been some storm ! Especially for those of you in the West End , and perhaps near the Airport as well . At about 2010 Oct 27 5:20 pm or so , Dominion reported only 17 power outages in the Richmond-Petersburg area . Moments later there were over 10,000 and now there are about 12,000 or so power outages . Fortunately we didn't get hit ; we were south of where it went .

Internet news sites insist on throwing in ads before you get to see videos on their sites . This time a < PROPMALE > -Spitzer video was preceded by an ad advertising the first feel-good comedy of the fall .

Is your computer an hour behind ? Mine was this morning . Shortly after they changed the definition of DST a number of years ago , I installed a patch on my computer that corrects the time DST comes ( from last week of Oct to first week of Nov ) . Today my computer was an hour behind - because I had to reinstall the operating system in April because of a virus and I did not remember to reinstall the patch . 
< PROPFIRST > the Cantor Set just called me up by computer , making him the only one in the race to do so . He asked me to give < PROPFEMALE > Pelosi the pink slip . No . Tomorrow I am going to give < PROPFIRST > the uncountable , measure zero , totally disconnected Cantor Set the pink slip with my vote for < PROPMALE > Waugh . Even Bayne is better .

I just tried to post something here to only my family . Formerly , you could click the lock arrow and get a menu where you could restrict your message to a specific list ; for example , \Family\ " .

Today in my development and everywhere , everywhere I went there were Cantor signs . There were an uncountable number of Cantor signs out there , especially near the polling places , but the measure of their content was not much more than what one sign says . It's a waste of material . He's ahead in the polls ; why does he persist with this sign racket ? 
It's possible that no party controls the House now . A battle between Republicans and the Tea Party seems to be brewing , and that could result in a separate Tea Party , which would deny Republicans a majority . It is even conceivable on some issues that the Tea Party could side with Democrats , for example , in the way that the government seems to favor Wall Street CEOs . 
As of late I find that Safari 5 will not print pictures or images on a webpage . I print a webpage and I get all the text and blank areas for pictures . What's with this browser ? I got it because all the sites don't like IE6 , but at least IE6 prints images . Is there some setting that has gone wacky ? 
With a Republican house , it seems nothing will get done the next couple of years . I hope essential bills such as budget resolutions don't get held up . Obama will probably win in 2012 , provided he resolves the Afghanistan situation satisfactorily . It seems whether or not he wins will depend on Afghanistan . 
Has there been a volcanic eruption near < PROPMALE > , NC ? Or maybe it's some politician's hot air . In any case , Louisburg , NC , reported a temperature of 120 degrees with a dew point of 117 degrees ; at 2010 Nov 4 6:28 pm it was down to 103 , but the heat index was 142 .

Obama just doesn't get it . Today he called for economic growth . But because world oil production has plateaued and is about to decline , there can be no more economic growth , because in our world that requires oil . He should have been telling us to conserve , shop locally , and develop alternative sources , without economic growth .

Obama is going the wrong way in Afghanistan . He is moving tanks into the country , increasing our involvement , and says we won't leave until 2014 , after the 2012 election . Further , he and other countries are wanting to build a $280 million missile defense system . With the debt as big as it is , how are we going to pay for it all ? He is asking for defeat in 2012 .

Interesting novel has just come out - Prelude , by < PROPMALE > Cobb . It is about a government worker privy to secret communication saying that the world is growing dangerously short of oil , and of the intrigue that results from her disclosing it . It seems better than Kunstler's World Made by Hand , because it is set in today's world , so that people can relate to it . 
I noticed in Parade magazine this morning that < PROPFEMALE > Vos Savant is bringing back the car and goats again . Only this time it's 4 sealed envelopes with $100 in one of them .

We have one severe thunderstorm threat and four snow threats the next couple of weeks . Tonight we are supposed to get thunderstorms .

The Times-Dispatch and the < PROPFEMALE > n-Pilot both have an article this morning about Farmville , < PROPFEMALE > . This town is probably losing public recognition because of this stupid game on Facebook with the same name . Mention Farmville and people will think you mean the Facebook game . When I say Farmville to you , I mean the real town in < PROPFEMALE > , unless you live in NC , in which case I mean Farmville , NC . 
I just heard that Obama will come out with a < PROPMALE > address to the nation on a compromise with the Senate at 6:10 pm . He really chose a bad time for this - he is going to bomb out all of the local newses all over the nation , including weather reports . I guess he wants those concerned about upcoming winter storms to vote Republican . He should have chosen a time when a football game was being broadcasted instead . 
I heard recently that one area of Midlothian , < PROPFEMALE > got 84 inches of snow last week . 
We have 1/2 inch of snow so far in Bon Air . Looks like we are going to get 4 inches , so I will name this storm . In my tradition of naming snowstorms after Republicans , I will call this one Snowstorm Huckabee . 
Hey where did this storm go ? It snowed 1.5 inches at my house , then turned to sleet and freezing rain . The weather people said we were to get 3-5 , or 4-6 inches or something like that . 
I ran to the duck pond today and found the pond mostly covered with ice . Canada geese were walking on the ice , and near the fountain where it was still liquid , a mute swan and some ducks were swimming . The geese are going to get their feet cold .

Weather forecast for the next six weeks : possible drizzle or light wintry precipitation tomorrow ( 31st ) , cloudy and 45 Tuesday ( 1st ) , and unusually warm and rainy , high 65-70 Wednesday on the 2nd . After that , temperatures will be unusually warm at least until mid-March , an early spring , because with the clouds on Wednesday , the Ground Hog will not see his shadow , so he will go out and < PROPMALE > wood . 
I have been watching < PROPMALE > Jazeera English off and on with my computer ; can't get it on TV . To me the news coverage has much less hype than CNN and other Western networks have , and it gives what I think is a reasonable prioritization to the news ; none of this celebrity and reality show stuff and certainly no football , although you can find some sports . It favors the Middle East , but not overly so . 
What happens when the groundhog comes out and sees a 24-inch blizzard or a < PROPMALE > ice storm ? Does that mean summer and 90 degree temperatures come soon ? Or will the storm clouds clear just enough to enable this varmint to see his own shadow ?

Something happened to this forecast of temperatures around 20 C today . It was 64 F about 8:50 this morning but in about 15 minutes it plunged to 51 . I think it is going to be in the 40s today .

Forecast for this week : Wednesday , < PROPFEMALE > and mild . Thursday , < PROPFEMALE > and warm . Friday , fire . Next week : salamanders , maybe ? 
Facebook Facebook . I understand I understand you like to you like to publish my comment publish my comment twice twice . Well well I got news for you I got news for you . When you do that when you do that on one of the comments on one of the comments I hit delete [ remainder of my comment deleted ] .

The highlights of yesterday's ( Feb 18 ) Science Museum of < PROPFEMALE > Skywatch were a pass of the International Space Station and an Iridium flare , both brighter than Jupiter . Big bright full < PROPFEMALE > seemed imposing in a telescope but details could be made out only on a border . Full < PROPFEMALE > and clouds interfered but did not prevent us from seeing Jupiter , M42 , M44 , and M45 ( the Pleiades ) . 
Tunisia , Egypt , Iran , < PROPFIRST > , Yemen , Bahrain , Libya , Wisconsin . 
They really have some crappy ads at 6:30 news time on TV . I rated them for about 8 days and came up with 89 Fs , 32 Ds , 17 Cs , one B , and no As . The ads ' quality needs to be improved . I may wind up watching only the first 15 minutes of news and not see the rest . 
Wisconsin Gov . < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > reminds me of Hosni Mubarak and Moammar Gadhafi . 
Big crash coming ? Price of oil is $112 in London ($98 here ) per barrel and is accelerating rapidly . People MUST have their gasoline ; else they can't get to necessary places such as work places and grocery stores . So they do without these places , and sooner or later this will cause a < PROPMALE > catastrophe . In 2008 that catastrophe was huge number of house foreclosures . What will it be this time ? 
2011 Feb 26 11:24 pm . Interesting . Temperature fell rapidly from its high of 53 today to about 39 at 9 pm , then stayed at 39 for a while , and now it is back up to 43 ! Warm air is coming into our area from somewhere . The prediction had called for a low in the mid 30s . 
Oil prices are moving up again . Last time they did this in 2008 , they < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > until something broke . It turned out to be bad mortgages . They are rising again . What will break this time ? Because Libyan oil will decrease greatly , I think one of the PIIGS is going to default - maybe Italy or Spain . That will cause it . Of course this is just my opinion , but Italy gets a lot of oil from Libya . 
Today is March 4 . Have you Marched Forth today ? If so , to where ? 
If you think gasoline prices are high now , just wait until this weekend , when it will be VICTORY OR DEATH ! Or at least that is what < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > said on today's 6:30 pm news on Channel 12 . 
The IRS is too good to be true , or at least that is in a pps file that someone sent me recently . 
Does switching to GEICO save you 15% or more on car insurance ? Can a mouse really keep a dog as a pet ? 
The Shuttle Discovery will remain in space forever . It will not return to Earth this week or the next or the next , because once it lands , it will be hauled away into a museum , and no shuttle has ever liked being cooped up in a museum . They will try to land it but the ship will not cooperate . It will put out a warning saying \Landing Aborted . Reason : You mean I will never fly again ? \"" 
Three times in the last few minutes , a comment that I or someone else made on my post or on some other person's post has suddenly vanished . Is Facebook trying to suppress our 1st amendment rights ? 
The authors of an article by the McClatchy-Tribune that appeared in today's Times Dispatch apparently show a lack of knowledge of economic principles . They say that oil will increase in price because of the loss of Japanese refining capacity . But oil that can't be refined is worthless , so its price will DECREASE . In fact , oil lost $2 a barrel yesterday . Gasoline prices WILL go up , however . 
Japanese cucumbers rank first on masculinity , so they are bitter ; that means they are infertile and can't multiply . 
I heard about a child born in Japan just after the quake occurred . A possible name for this child is Teremoto , which sounds Japanese , but is instead the Spanish for \earthquake\ " ( minus an \ " r \") . " 
I am impressed with the reporting of < PROPFEMALE > Maddow . She seems really knowledgeable on nuclear reactors and other subjects , and she is one of the few media people to take a stand against media hype . She has severely criticized the New York Daily News for its headline of \PANIC ! \ " in huge letters . " 
It's St < PROPFIRST>'s Day ! Let's celebrate by making everything green . Wear green clothes , put green paper in printers , drink green beer , and set every traffic light in the Richmond area to green in all directions throughout the day . 
The designers of the Fukushima nuclear power plants have created a new definition of the term \hydrogen bomb \"." 
Now day is longer than night . Yesterday sunrise and sunset were both about 7:18 . 
No-fly zone means get rid of Gadhafi . That's because Gadhafi's a fly . He needs to be swatted . 
Last night at 12:20 am or so we were woken up by some really fast winds . These were not in any forecast given by NOAA or any TV meteorologist . Richmond airport recorded 32 mph winds with gusts to 51 . Now neither NOAA nor any TV meteorologist has predicted snow this Wednesday , so therefore I predict that there WILL be a snowstorm this Wednesday . ( especially since a recent run of GFS suggested snow . ) 
Snow coming ? Dgex next week is calling for 8 inches of snow for Richmond , and Accuweather in its Trend Forecast for this Friday says all of < PROPFEMALE > will get snow . 
I was thinking of replacing my Toyota Prius with another Prius or Corolla , but will it be radioactive ? 
I thought I was being facetious the other day when I mentioned that Dgex was suggesting snow this weekend or next week , but now several other sites are saying there could be snow : Wintercast , Accuweather , Dgex , Coolwx , GFS , and ECMWF , and even the TV mets are mentioning snow north of us . The most likely date seems to be March 30 . 
It seems the Aflac Duck has lost his voice ( starcasm < PROPFEMALE > net slash archives slash 90048 ) . That voice , < PROPMALE > Gottfried , was fired by Aflac for making insensitive remarks about the Japan disaster . Well maybe he did , but now that means we have to put up with more insensitive medical ads instead of the comic performances of this duck . 
So many folks are now using RVA to mean Richmond , < PROPFEMALE > . That is unacceptable . It is ambiguous and could mean Roanoke , < PROPFEMALE > . I am surprised that people from Roanoke haven't complained yet . A better abbreviation is < PROPFEMALE > . Down by the < PROPFEMALE > . Richmond is well-known for the recreational and natural facilities the < PROPFIRST > provides . 
One of the most romantic marriages in recent times was that of < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . One of the least romantic was that of < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . 
A massive power outage hit the Cloverleaf Mall area about 20 minutes ago , according to Dominion's web site , affecting over 3400 customers . It now affects about 1768 . We had three power glitches , causing the TV to turn off . This was a quiet night , mostly cloudy , winds 8 mph , nothing that would cause a power outage . Did someone hit a pole ? 
Now I hear that the 10K race this weekend has been renamed the Rampede in honor of the VCU Rams . That discriminates against other Richmond area schools , including the University of Richmond . They would want to rename it the Arachnithon . 
Does switching to GEICO ( from Company X ) really save you 15% or more on car insurance ? Does switching to Company X ( from GEICO ) save you 15% or more on house insurance ? Does swapping companies save you 30% or more on car AND house insurance ? Judging from quotes I recently got , I'd say yes . 
April Fool's day is now over . The P = NP problem is now solved . Scientists came up with a Theory of Everything only to find a force that they had not seen before . A team of biologists and geologists reveal to world for the first time a cloned live Tyrannosaur . 10 trillion barrels of oil were discovered in Antarctica . And a cross between a hummingbird and a < PROPFEMALE > was discovered - it was named a humdinger . 
The Ukrops 10K race was a good one , with ideal weather , but the race , with 40,000 runners , is far too big . I propose that this race be held every month instead of every year , and that the hype be equally distributed throughout the year , so that each race has only 3,300 runners . I don't know how much time it took runners to get to the starting line after the gun went off , but it must have been long . 
Almanacs have soul ! 
Gasoline prices near where I am went up 10 cents last week and went up 10 more cents today , to $3.67 a gallon . I think that's caused by Japan's reduced refining capacity , forcing them to buy gasoline on the open market , making prices go up .

Eastern League pitchers don't pitch baseballs . Richmond Flying Squirrels pitch acorns , New Hampshire Fisher Cats pitch fish , New Britain Rock Cats pitch rocks , Harrisburg Senators pitch legislative bills , Bowie Baysox pitch socks , Reading Phillies pitch horseshoes , Binghamton Mets pitch Metro tickets , Akron Aeros pitch paper airplanes , and < PROPMALE > Thunder pitch hailstones . 
Three years ago Easter was unusually early , in mid March . This year it is really late , on April 24 . Why so much variability ? To determine Easter , first you have to determine the Dominical Letter . To do this , divide the last two digits of the year by 12 , take the quotient , the remainder , and the 4s in that , add them , divide by 7 and take the remainder . 
If you go to phoebeallens.com , you get a stupid ad . But if you wait until the ad is over , you get an < PROPFIRST>'s hummingbird on her nest of two pink eggs somewhere in California . Apparently she has had several litters of two birds at a time over the past year . Ignore the stupid ads that appear on the bottom of the screen . Hit X on them . 
There was a terrible editorial in the Richmond Times-Disgrace this morning . It advocates solving the federal deficit problem by selling all the Western lands that the Federal Government owns to the oil companies . 
I just saw Guy Kinman on Channel 8 news , at 2011 April 20 5:02 pm EDT , defending the rights of the gay community , in this case with respect to adoption . This 94-year-old man is a member of my congregation , First UU of Richmond , \ 
and I feel he is an inspiration to all . 
I hope Obama and company don't harp on these oil prices too much and that speculators and oil companies are bilking us with them . The basic cause is peak oil , with Libyan cutoff of oil a secondary cause . If media , Obama and others harp on high gasoline prices , the result could be price controls , shortages , and long lines at the pumps . 
Happy Easter ! We got out our Easter eggs . One has < PROPFEMALE > Claus ' face on it . This is a cross-holiday object . Other cross-holiday entities include Cupid ( Christmas and < PROPFIRST>'s Day ) , fireworks on New Year's < PROPFEMALE > ( New Year's Day and Independence Day ) , and the US Flag ( Flag Day , Independence Day , Veteran's and Memorial Days ) . 
Well , Easter is now over . It was one of the best Easters in years , with nice warm temperatures and fair skies . However , Easter IMO is the worst holiday of the year . It disrupts EVERYTHING , even things that don't close at Christmas . It wanders all over the place , making it hard to do long range planning ; you got to know about dominical letters , epacts , and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > to understand when Easter is . 
Raise the federal debt limit to infinity . The consequences of a US Govt default are much too great to impose any kind of a limit .

What if people from Roanoke start using \RVA\ " to mean their town ? That'd quickly end the use of \ " RVA \"." 
NATO swatted the Gadhafi hornet but didn't get it . Now that hornet is mad and may come after NATO .

Thinking of < PROPFEMALE>'s Ventura Highway - The days are longer , the nights are stronger than moonshine . What does it mean for a night to be strong ?
