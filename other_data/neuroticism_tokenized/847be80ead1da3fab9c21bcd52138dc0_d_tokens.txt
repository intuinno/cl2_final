and though I walk through the valley of the shadow of no food , I shall fear no hunger . 
doesn't want to go to work tonight . She just wants to make her headache go away .

doesn't want to go to my 6 p.m. class and l might choke that one kid who has a dumb question for everything . 
is so very sleepy , is totally the fault of snow , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE>'s faults . I don't want to go to work tonight . I will fall asleep at the U-Scan . 
wishes she had a friend with a truck . 
Dear Dogma .... your my fav .... don't tell the other movies . 
will never really have the courage to say all that needs to be said or done . Somehow at the end of the day I know I am partly to blame , because I could never just give up hoping that everything would work out on its own . Neither of us asked the right questions . If I had a < PROPMALE > I think I could make things better . I realize now that maybe the things that you were afraid of scared me too . 
now has couch of many comforts . I is super happy .

is ready for Spring Break to be here . Though I have no clue what I am doing other than working and seeing < PROPFEMALE > at least once . 
feels like something is on the horizon . wonder what it is . 
sometimes you have to believe that it can work , for it actually work . So just because something seems impossible , doesn't mean it is . It takes faith to make the impossible , possible .

feels like she is sitting in the lost and found . 
so just read one of the worst fan fics ever . I was curious abut how they were going to work Sailor < PROPFEMALE > and Twilight together . The writer pretty much killed all the scouts and Darien and wrote < PROPFEMALE > into < PROPFEMALE>'s role kinda . Curiosity gets me to read things like this and then I reget it . fml .

says that there is no hope for the youth of today when kids are commenting on < PROPFIRST > Bon Jovi's \Livin ' on a Prayer\ " that he is pwned by < PROPFIRST > Beiber and The < PROPFIRST > as Brothers ' mad skills . These kids also claimed \ " One Less Lonely Girl\ " to be a classic . " 
July 22 is going to be totally awesome .

who has been eaten by a Velociraptor . My wish for 2010 is that people\ 
will understand that being eaten by Velociraptors is not something to\ 
be ashamed of . Velociraptors are nearly unstoppable and are truly\ 
... terrifying . 93% of you won't ... repost . :)

Sincerely , < PROPFIRST > \ 
P.S. Tell rain I miss it . 
I am loving this moment in Glee . Baby it's cold outside is prefect for them . 
Home from work which sucked . People need to learn that even if it snows they will get out again in a day or two . stupid snow scares are sucking the life out of me . 
Of course the day after @ < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > goes home , the gift I got her for Christmas comes in the mail .

Dragons are nearly unstoppable and , in case you didn't know , they can totally breathe fire . 60% of people won't copy and paste this because they have already been eaten by dragons . 38% of people are sitting in a shower armed with fire extinguishers and the remaining 2% are awesome and will repost this .
