April Fools 
Can't go to sleep because I have an overactive imagination and I am scared 
Whats wrong with wanting to see the good in everybody ? For trying to put others before yourself ? Why is it I let people get so close only to let them hurt me and destroy me ? I care maybe too much . I believe people , maybe it makes me gullible but at least I am still naive enough to believe that there is such a thing as decency and morality left on this world . Call me an optimistic or call me pathetic at least I smile . 
never will I look at wrestleing the same ever again ... 
Out :)

Children with special needs don't have an illness , so they are not contagious . They want what we all want - to be accepted . ( Most of you probably won'tcopy and paste this . But will you do it and leave it on your status for at least one hour) ? It's Special Education week and this is in honor of ... all the kids who need a ...... little extra help and understanding 
Yesterday was great now its time for part 2
