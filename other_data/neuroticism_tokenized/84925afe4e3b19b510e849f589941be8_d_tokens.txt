Put this as your status if you know someone who \ 
suffers from being an OU fan . Being a Sooner fan is a real disorder and \ 
should be taken seriously . There is still no known cure for it and \ 
sympathy does not help , but we can raise awareness .

Just had my first quiet time in I don't know how long . I know that I have asked people to pray about some things I was struggling with , but now I know that the heart of the problem was the almost nonexistent relationship with God . I will probably still struggle with those things , so please keep praying . And please pray that He won't let me wander that far from Him ever again .

Little baby on the hay , \ 
Soon there'll be another day\ 
When nails shall pierce\ 
Your hands and feet\ 
As You provide our sin's defeat . \ 
Risen Jesus on the throne , \ 
We lift our praise to You alone -\ 
For You're the gift that we receive\ 
The moment that our hearts believe . \

A true friend doesn't care when you're broke , in a bad mood , what you weigh , if your house is a mess , what you drive , about your past , or if your family is filled with CRAZY people . Your conversations pick up where they left off , even if they have been months apart . They love you for who you are . Re-post if you have at least one true friend . They will know who they are
