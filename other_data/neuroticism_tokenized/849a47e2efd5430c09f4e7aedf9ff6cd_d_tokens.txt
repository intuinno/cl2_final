Yay ! Coming home !!!!! I'm at < PROPMALE > right now ... waiting for the DC plane . 

Looks like we aren't going to DC ... We're going to Chicago then to < PROPMALE > . So looks like we're going to get home an hour later than originally exspected . :/ 
Seeing how my own Facebook works ! Yay , finally 13 ! 
I'm so glad I'm finding my friends and family on here ! 
I'm starting my biggest project ... The Scavanger Hunt !!! Dun , dun , dun ! lol 
Here's a great idea for facebook , a big ' accept all ' button at the bottom of a group of request for whatever . It sure would be more convenient . 
We're decorating our Christmas Tree ! Christmas is coming up quick ! 
Got my expander out ot my mouth ( Yat , finally !!! ) , but I missed the Camo Day Pep Rally ( Aw ) but it was totally worth it !!! 
Okay , the no expander is awesome , the rubber bands and the thicker wire , not so much . It's Friday !!! Weekend yay !! 
I'm feeling pretty good about my Tx . History mid-term exam thing . The only thing I had trouble memorizing was where the Indian tribes were ... 
Made it through < PROPFEMALE > mid-terms today . It wasn't that hard , we all finished pretty early , so we started watching a movie . Pretty much a blow off day , and early realease !!! 
Made it through finals week !!! Yay ! Now I have a little more than two weeks away from school ! 
Had a great time at Aunt < PROPFEMALE>'s last night ! It was great seeing everyone again !!! 
The countdown is on !!! Christmas in about 3 days !!! < PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone ! 
Two more days !!! Going shopping with Paw-Paw later today !!!! 
Hey guys , I got a phone !!! Here's my number . 281- 460- 5810 ( I think u have to put a 1 infront of it if ur in AR ... ) 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas , ho you guys get everything you wished for ! Happy Birthday Jesus ! 
Getting ready for Disney ! Going to Paw Paws in a minute to get a backpack to put stuff in for the plane ride ! I promise lots of pictures ! 
Still getting ready for Disney . Attempting to remember all those hundred things you forget as you're leaving . I'm still gonna forget something lol . 
And I would like to invite you all to 2011 , now go set something on fire . ;) 
Rearranging my bedroom . A change of scenery was desperately needed . ^_^ 
I wonder what's going to happen on HEROES tonight ... 
I just re-pierced my ears , all by myself . It hurts ... but I'll be able to wear earrings again !!! 
Fixing to go to a friends for a Gumbo Night ! Yum Yum ! 
It's friday , it's friday !!! * Dances around * lol 
I love the weekends ! You can sleep in and relax without having to worry about staying awake or concentrating on some lesson . Yay for weekends !!! 
I'm not sure about you other Texans , but I'm ready for it to warm back up . 75*F sounds nice . 
I feel like crap . Plain ' n ' simple . 
I just did my nails .... whoo , its been a VERY exciting day , not really lol . I'm going to school tomorrow ... yay ! > o < 
Okay , lesson learned . DO NOT WAIT TO FINISH PROJECT THE NIGHT BEFORE !!! Geez , but I forgot about idue to the fact I wasn't there all week . Grrr . 
I learned sign language ... the only one i don't remember is ' p ' 
Fixing to head back out ! I'm gonna spend pretty much the rest of the night at a friends . Yay !!! Just coming home for a while to charge my phone and update fb lol . 
I was playing this virtual game , and I only left it for about 12 hours , and everyone of my virtual people died ! Seriously ! 
I got my new elective today !!! Exploratory Languages yay !!! 
I survived the schedule change ! Yay , lol . Just going to sit back and relax for a while . I really don't feel like reading right now . Or going through my science book . :/ 
I just got back to the house . I spent the night at a friends . 
I'm not gonna be at my house tonight again . But tonight I'm babysitting for a family friend . Yay ! 
I just found the funniest videos of one of my friends on youtube . I'm still giggling because he does that in class too . 
You & I woke up in jail together ... using only FOUR words ... what would you say to me ? Copy and paste this in your status and see what funny things your friends say .... ( And if you make a comment , you gotta put this in your status . Fair is fair . ) 
Wow , I hardly realized this , but I have almost a hundred and fifty friends ... 
I finally took off the Christmas stuff on my door ! I completely forgot about it lol ! 
I just got a friend request from a band called \Skyrocket Love\ " they're actually pretty good . Just thought that some of you guys might like to know . " 
I have one question . And please don't take this wrong , BUT HOW CAN YOU LISTEN TO < PROPFIRST > BEIBER ??? 
Go to urbandictionary.com, type in your first name , copy and paste this as your status , and put the first entry for your name under comments 
If any of you know how to get music on the tab things at the top of your profile , I'd appreciate help . Merely because I'd find a way to delete everting on Facebook . :/ 
They changed Facebook . Great , now I'm gonna have to re-figure out how to do this . :| 
Got my braces tightened ... sort of . I now have ' chains ' ( or a link of the things that hold the brackets together ) and they actually loosened the wire because the chains will help close the gaps between my teeth . Also , no more rubberbands for now . Yay ! My mouth now hurts like crap . 
So my < PROPFIRST>'s hasn't been completely ruined ... yet . We just got a kitten ! It isn't mine , its mom's , but still its at my house ! It doesn't have a name yet though . 
Random thought : < PROPFIRST > Leoni ( Artist that did the song ' Medicine ' ) sounds nearly exactly like Lady GaGa . 
Okay , um this thing I accedentally clicked on in the side bar that says ' Who Is Blocking You . ' and it spammed some peoples pages , so if it did it to your's i am sorry . 
I have a confession . I am addicted to Facebook and becoming a fan of random thing I'll probably never look at again . Saturday I was a fan of 168 pages , Sunday 367 , today 537 . 
\Seasons change but people don't . \ " Listening to FOB at their best . " 
Post this as your status and see how your friends respond : If you know me , you know that I am _____ , I love _____ and that I can't stand _____ . 
Yay ! FINALLY FRIDAY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No school tomorrow !!!!! So happy about that ... but I have a bit of English and Math to make up . Grr . Still * IT'S FRIDAY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! * 
Looks like I've finally given into the evil of a school dance . I've gone insane I think . 
My Lil sis made a Facebook . Her name is < PROPFIRST > . Me , being the great older sister I am , is helping her set it up . 
Rawr ! I hate all these things that basically spam my friends pages ... this is like the thrid time I've done this ... Grrrrr . 
In loving memory of every cancer patient , family and friends who have lost the battle of cancer and the ones who continue to conquer it ! Put this on your < PROPFEMALE > if you know someone who has or had cancer . Dear God I pray for the cure of cancer . Amen 
Stupid school . There's a new game called ' The ' X ' Game ' . It is no fun . Especially when YOU'RE the victim . On a happier note , I think Payton Bourgeois and I are going to start a game of ' assassin ' . Ask him about it . Basically you get a target , and then you stick a post it note on them with mjh.ag . ( your name ) . Going to be fun I hope ... only mjhs students , and you have to tell me or him :D . 
I am going to have to go get my braces fixied on Monday ... stupid chain tore on the second to last bracket on the bottom . :( I'm wondering what I did to it to make it tear . 
HA ! I got my Microsoft to work again !!! I'm going to be a much more pleasant person now I think . :) 
Doesn't feel great . * sniff , sniff , sneeze * Allergies ... * sneezes again * 
Does anybody know French , like know-know French . Here's what I've ( sorta ) picked up on Vu- yourself Tablo-Table/ desk Port- Door . I swear I pay attention . 
I just really hurt my ankle .... I fell off of a curb .... I was chasing after a reciept that flew out Mom's wallet .... I feel kinda ' tupid right about now .... :*( 
Dear Computer , I have not a clue why you are refusing to download Aerosmith . I've listened to harder rock and you haven't objected . Thank you for understanding . NOW DOWNLOAD THE ALBUM ! 
I feel so much like the music master right now . lol . Mom lended me some of her old cassette tapes and they sound just as good as cds do ! My 60's-90's music collection is almost finished for the most part . I have White Snake , ZZ Topp , Bon Jovi , Aerosmith(of course ) , Def Leppard , < PROPFIRST > Miller Band , and the Eagles , anyone else really < PROPMALE > that I am missing ??? 
I helped dissect a worm today ... yeah , next time I see one there's a 99% < PROPMALE > I will flip out ...

Went and saw Clash of the Titans with Gram . The movie was AWESOME !!!! 
has realized that she has been introduced to three new languages this year so far . 1 . Spanish 2 . French 3 . Algebra . a(b+c/d) = x+y+Z = 4 Z = t/u . Yeah , that kinda looks like a new language to me . ( Even though I've never had to do a problem like that , THANK GOODNESS ! )
