The only change in the original design of Slinky since its launch in 1945 has been to crimp the ends as a safety measure .

Exhausting but wonderful weekend in San < PROPFIRST > . Japanese Tea Garden , < PROPMALE > Tut exhibit at the De Young , dinner at Fisherman's wharf , < PROPFEMALE > light boat ride around the bay ( no fog ) , hotel , visiting friends in Milpitas , shopping , out to < PROPFEMALE > Headlands , dinner at Amici's East Coast Pizzeria , home ...

Just finished ' Lost ' - it has been a strange and entertaining trip with an interesting end . 
Good morning and happy Friday everyone ! 
Having dinner @ The Counter ... GREAT BURGERS ! Feeling tired after shoping and going to the park and now hope the girls go to sleep early . 
Whole family and cleaning house ( puttering really ) instead of BBQ in park like I planed . This stinks :-( Maybe I'll BBQ the pork sholder on the porch . Or waste time on facebook ( aka face-crack ) . 
< PROPFEMALE > is now standing while holding something for ballance ! 
I am awake and going to work - that does not mean I need to like it . 
Hi , this is < PROPFIRST>'s wife < PROPFIRST > . Not sure if you all knew < PROPFIRST > was going in for a < PROPMALE > neck surgery today ( to correct some old injuries ) and just wanted to let you all know that it was a success ! 
All went well , and all things considered , I feel good - or is that just the pain killers ? \

After five years I now have feeling in both hands ! 
It has come to my attention that because of the instant messenger program I use , it looks like I am always on Facebook . I love getting updates from everyone - but please understand that the reason I take so long to respond is that I rarely ever go to the FB site . However , my IM is on anytime I am online . And because my school and work are both online , I am almost always online during the day .
