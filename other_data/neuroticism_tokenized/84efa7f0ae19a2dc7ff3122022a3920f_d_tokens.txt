So .... adding new note . Check it out once it's up . Let me know what you think . 

So ... Blue October and Coldplay are , and forever will be my two favorite bands of all time . However , there are others that I get obsessed with . Currently ? Death Cab for Cutie . Favorite song by them at the moment is ' Little Bribes ' , ' Passenger Seat ' , or ' I 
So ... thoughts on < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ? I'm curious as to what all of you think of it . 
The RESULTS ARE IN ! Guess I'm going to be growing my hair out for a while now . Everybody just loves my hair =p 
Even though there were only like six votes .... 
SO ANYBODY INTERESTED IN SEEING SOME PHOTOGRAPHS ?!!?!! >.< http://www.deviantart.com/sawyerJR 
GOING TO PICK UP A SURROUND SOUND SYSTEM !!!! 
... cut my hair . But not TOO short . 
Anybody else up for a 17 hour bus ride ? 
17 hour bus ride to Texas tonight at 10:00 
Got back from Texas today ... bittersweet . Sweet because she will be with me again ... only this time in Tennessee , for the first time . 
So , uh ... School starts in a week ... 
Sorry everyone , but you just lost the game . 
There is a song ... and that song has grown on me . Because I like playing older games . And that song is ' Be With You ' by a band called magnet . And if somebody could find out as to where I can download this song , I'd be forever grateful . And I'd love you long time . 
G O O D N I G H T everybody . Sleep Well . 
I don't know what just happened , it was awkward , and it was oddly sexy . And I loved it . 
This is gay . I made a video with TJ and I can't upload it anywhere because of damn copyrights . Anyone know how to get permission to use a song ? 
Sucks . 
So , should I feel bad about downloading free mp3's ? 
SO !! I want some new music . Since a certain friend of mine had to leave earley , my new music fix has been compromised for the next five days . So all of you out there that wouldn't mind recommending something , and/or adding a link to a download/video of it , please do so . Also , I must say I don't enjoy Rap or really any R&B . Or Country . I listen to just about everything else . 
AH ! A minor adjustment from my last post ... Linkin Park and Flobots are acceptable . Some people like to classify Linkin Park under Rap , and Flobots Rap/R&B . 
Hm . Well . People suck . It all sucks . 100 days , 15 hours , and 21 minnutes . 
I love her . 
Restarting . 
I think that you should know , that you're much better than me . 
Brutal Legend 
Someday ........ it WILL be better .

Hello . 
So ..... who is at BP and who isnt at this point ? 
Start Over . 
I am sawyer and I like pie . 
But if i move my place in line I'll lose . \ 
And I have waited , the anticipation's got me glued . \ 
I am waiting for something to wrong . \ 
I am waiting for familiar resolve . \ 
I am waiting for another repeat , \ 
another diet fed by crippling defeat . \ 
And I am waiting for that sense of relief . \ 
I am waiting for you to flee the scene , \ 
as if you held in your hand the smoking gun , \ 
and on the floor lay the one you said you loved . 
YES ! Internet connection !! ITS ALIVE !!!!!! 
Dude , Grace < PROPFIRST > by < PROPFEMALE > sounds just like < PROPFEMALE > .....

I just finished all my exhibition work . 
9.1 GB left with a downloading speed of 173 KB per second left of the \ 
WoW dowload ... so bored . That's generally 10 minutes per 0.1 GB meaning , \ 
it's another nihihihine hours .... * nerdpout * 
Love of mine ... someday , you will die . \ 
But I'll be close behind , I'll follow you into the dark . \ 
No blinding light or tunnels to gates of white , \ 
\ 
Just our hands clasped so tight , \ 
Waiting for the hint of the spark ... \ 
If Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied , \ 
Illuminate the no's on their vacancy signs , \ 
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks , \ 
Then I'll follow you into the dark . 
Feather - Nujabes . Yes .

PLEASE put this on your status if you know someone or are related to someone who has been eaten by dragons . Dragons are nearly unstoppable and in case you didn't know , they can breathe fire . 93% of people won't copy and paste this , because they have already been eaten by dragons . 6% of people are sitting in the shower ... armed with fire extinguishers , and the remaining 1% are awesome and will repost this . 
Aw , crap . My stomach is hurting ... I feel like I might puke . School's gonna be awesome today . 
To all of you who have tried to get a hold of me recently , I apologize . I'm having issues . It's been rather rough . Those of you who know me well enough will be able to guess what it's regarding . So if I'm not able to return your calls or respond to your messages I'm very sorry and I promise to make it up to you .
