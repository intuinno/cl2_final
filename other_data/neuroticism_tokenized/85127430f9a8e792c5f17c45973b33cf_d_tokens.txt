Don't make this easy , I want you to mean it , Jasey ( Say you'll mean it ) . You're dressed to kill , I'm calling you out , don't waste your time on me . I've never told a lie , and that makes me a liar , I've never made a bet , but we gamble with desire , I've never lit a match , with intent to start a fire , but recently the flames are getting out of control . 
It's gotten to the point that I'm < PROPFEMALE > used to clicking become a fan for the various things that when I see one that I really do not want to join I have to stop take a few seconds to gather myself and then not click . This should not be happening to a person . 
Okk , < PROPFEMALE > I used to be the person who used to love joining pages and groups but this whole I joined 9847392 pages yesterday is really getting annoying . I mean come on !!! No one ever has \a creepy Mexican staring at them\ " how is that even a group ?!?!?!!? I mean it's racist for one and it never ever happens !!! Enough is enough !! " 
< PROPFEMALE > ichat and nasty pomegranate green tea ... turning out to be a pretty good night !!

Hurt Locker won 6 Oscars tonight , that made me happy I guess haha I definitely liked that movie , but all in all definitely a good Academy Awards . 
So I'm pretty sure The Script is my new obsession . Check them out . 
< PROPMALE > Beck , Rush Limbaugh and other conservative talk show hosts attack an 11 year old boy who lost his mother saying his story is just being used as a \sob story\ " . Real classy . "
