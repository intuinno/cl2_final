Wow I can't believe my beautiful little girl is now beautiful sweet sixteen !! Happy Birthday < PROPFEMALE > !! 

Hey everyone , Have you had your flu shot ?? Take my advice , Get it NOW !!! The first year in 15 I didn't get mine !! Man am I paying for it !! I'm going to try to stay out of bed at least a while today !! I feel like I died yesterday and haven't had the grace to fall down !!! 
I want to wish all my facebook friends a wonderful Thanksgiving !! God is so faithful let us all thank Him !! 
Our Bibles tell us that Absent from the body means present with the Lord so it is my priviledge to say that My Dad joined the Lord Wednesday evening . He got the best Christmas present any one can get , He is at peace . Please pray for the rest of us who have to go on . We are the ones in pain now . 
Well I'm home again after a long day . We didn't make it to Dad's funeral because of car trouble . It was a cheap fix after my husband figured it out , we evidently had some gas with water in it . I would have liked to have been at the funeral but God knows all about it all so it's OK . I did get to spend a few hours with my 3 youngest grandbabies that was nice . They knew I was upset and gave me extra hugs and kisses . 
Much to do ' cause < PROPFEMALE > comes tonight !!! If I don't get back on here later or even tomorrow ... .... < PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone have a great holiday !!! 
Hey , all my farmville and facebook friends I gave myself a make over !! Please drop by the farm and let me know what you think of the new and improved < PROPFEMALE > for 2010 !!!!! By the way Happy Happy New Year to all of my friends on facebook . May the Lord bless you real good in 2010 !!!!

I Wish heaven had a phone so I could talk to you again . I thought of you today , but that is nothing new . I thought about you yesterday , and days before that too . I think of you in silence . I often speak your name . All I have are memories and a picture in a frame . Re-post this if you have ...... someone in heaven that you miss and love . 
I like it where I'm gonna remember it !! 
1Thes 5:13 -15Get along among yourselves , each of you doing your part . Warn the freeloaders to get a move on . Gently encourage stragglers , reach out for the exhausted , help them to their feet . Be patient with each person , attentive to individual needs . Be careful when you get on each other's nerves & don't snap at each other . Look for the best in each other , always do your best to bring it out . 
Children with special needs don't have an illness , so there is no cure and it's not contagious . They want what we all want , to be accepted . Most of you probably won't copy and paste this . Could you do it and leave it on your status for at least 1 hour ? It's Special Education week and this is ... in honor of all the kids

MY PROMISE TO MY CHILDREN : I will stalk you , flip out on you , lecture you , drive you crazy , be your worst nightmare , embarrass you in front of your friends , & hunt you down like a bloodhound .. because I LOVE YOU ! When you understand that , I will know you are a responsible adult . You will NEVER find someone who loves you , prays for you , cares about you , or worries about you more than your MOM ! 
I believe in the right to keep and bear arms . One Facebooker has challenged all gun owners to put this on their wall . The Supreme Court of the United States has affirmed that the right to keep and bear arms is a fundamental right of the individual . If you Believe in the 2nd Amendment and you are not afraid to show it , re-post this\ 
God Bless < PROPFEMALE > !! 
Pease put this as your status for at least one hour if you or someone you know has , or had , an invisible illness ( Chiari Malformation , Diabetes , Crohn's , Rheumatoid Arthritis , Kidney Disease , Epilepsy , chronic migraines , Fibromyalgia , MS , COPD , Lupus , etc ) . Do it for all who have an invisible illness . It's a daily struggle to feel sick on the inside while you look fine on the outside 
I depend on God alone ; I put my hope in him . He alone protects and saves me ; he is my defender , and I shall never be defeated . My salvation and honor depend on God ; he is my strong protector ; he is my shelter . Psalm 62:5 -8
