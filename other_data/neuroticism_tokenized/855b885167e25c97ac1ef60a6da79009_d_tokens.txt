wants to see Avatar in 3D as soon as possible ! but with who .....? 
american idol needs those two old hecklers in the balcony on The Muppet Show . then it would be complete . 
sadly , will not be knighted until next month . Sry to disappoint , but it's too expensive , too short of notice , and i'm too busy to be ready in two days ! There's far too much to do .... 
is NOT taking the SAT tomorrow !! i guess i just won't go to college , but really who needs that ? 
saw Avatar 3D with < PROPFEMALE > Dodd and it changed my life forever !! now when i grow up and invent interstellar travel and find a new planet filled with life i'll name it pandora . then after i have tons of adventures with my ikran i'll strip mine the entire planet for its Unobtainium and become a trillionaire . 
apparently love US history so much that he's in Houser's 5th AND 6th hour APUSH .... 
Coinstar = my new best friend !

friend requests from people in Indonesia and now friend suggestions . WHAT IS GOING ON ? 
i think i'll shove all my iphone pics onto facebook tonight 
got up at 5 am this morning to get some free grand slams with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > DeJesus Glasgow , and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > !! 
puts the \M\ " in MITES !! " 
i finished my MITES essays at 4am last night and emailed them to mrs. vogt . she proofed and corrected them and sent them back at 8:30 . she did this thing where you have the original essay and all the changes , corrections , and comments mixed into it or off to the side . she's just that good . 
holy crap ! I've been watching the Discovery Channel since this morning ! 
I guesstimate that i've gotten an average of 2-4 hours sleep every night of < PROPMALE > Year . Double plus ungood . 
wants to take AP < PROPMALE > History next year so anyone who's even remotely interested needs to find me and sign up !!! 
so apparently being in speech therapy means i get to take the Science FCAT with the ESE kids . yay .....? 
got out of the ESE FCAT class !! By the way , AP < PROPMALE > HISTORY !! SIGN UP !! U can now register for it on Virtual Counselor , if not now , then MOnday !!! 
oh Drama , why do i keep giving you my money ? 
wow SATs , ur making me go to sleep at 11 , which is a personal record . Touché . 
' s boots have officially made it through three years of FLARF . huzzah ! 
I think I'm gonna start a 70s band . Not a tribute band , a funky 70s music group with our own original music . You in < PROPFEMALE > Dodd ? 
Universe , why do you insist on giving me a brand new FML story EVERY monday ? 
I'm convinced that whenever I try to print something , my printer flips a coin and decides whether or not to be a < PROPMALE > 
has sacrificed the entire 3rd quarter to French competitions and will end up with Bs in like four of his classes . worth it ? DEFINITELY !! 
The South Park version of < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > is going to give me nightmares . 
is not the father . 
just washed my hair but i couldn't get all the corn out . 
holy crap . 
SAT scores are in !! 
So apparently they've made an A-Team movie . The trailer's amazing ! 
Just watched Recount and now I'm mad again . And planning for a career as a political scientist/ constitutional scholar .... 
So i finally opened my backpack yesterday and there was a moldy dark chocolate bar . I have yet to start any homework . 
is trying to practice sax but it's not really working out . If only I had time to practice , I would know by now whether or not I'm actually terrible at this ...... 
Sigal Shemesh just hacked < PROPFIRST>'s facebook ! :D 
Dammit APES !! Now I can't eat ANYTHING ! 
if i type enough random keys , at some point a perfectly good documented argument paper will just pop up on the screen 
Did not get into MITES . i guess i have to get a job this summer ....

Miss Meadows , I'm afraid I'm not the marrying type of man . Cuz I'm a DINOSAUR !!!

At the nhs convention wondering where our advisor is .... 
needs to get twists as soon as possible 
My car just died in the intersection of university and sunrise . Thank god I was already headed towards this gas station 
my car came home !! On the back of a tow truck . it was very odd , but very cool . 
Has been having a very angry , angry day ... 
just woke up from a five hour nap , which is longer than i usually sleep in a night . so that's a good thing .....? 
at the awards ceremony i met mrs. stecker for the first time ever and she went : \Oh ! So YOU'RE Christian Keeve ! You have a very good reputation . \ " and i was like : \ " ............. ok \"" 
So instead of being gone for the weekend , my parents pulled off a 14 hour round trip to Tallahassee and back in A DAY . Blagh ... 
is SO tired of AP Calc practice problems . I'm just gonna chill for the next two days and assume that getting 5's on all of holmes's practice exams is a good sign . 
Is seriously considering Oberlin 
is feeling very AP confident 
So the new bathroom is almost done and it has a rain showerhead and I might just cut all my hair off to enjoy it . Plus it's getting really hot out . 
hates deadlines . SO much . 
wow . I did not study for the apush exam . Or do much of anything today . Christian Keeve method . Patented . 
ATTENTION SOPHOMORES :\ 
My barely used full set of Kaplan AP US History in a Box flash cards just went on sale today !! I know . Crazy right ? Which one of you overachievers would like to cash in on this great deal and get a head start on next year ? 
I love how everyone at the APES review is posting about how boring the APES review is . They're very right . I've been in the back texting the entire time 
registering for the SAT would be so much less painful if i had a job . and if i had gotten the right registration deadline 
APES review if there is one good thing you did it's turn me on to SparkCharts . I got some to study for AP Chem and they're fucking amazing !! They have EVERYTHING !!! 
Do we really have a bunch of homework due tomorrow for Houser ? I'm not doing it either way cuz I have three more exams coming up but still .... 
APLAC kids : \ 
tomorrow remember to stick to the Vogt Code !! And include some reference to dinosaurs and/or ninjas in your essays ! 
quoted < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > in my 3rd APLAC essay . So if I get a 5 someone's gettin ' a thank you letter ! 
Love the solar powered flashlight that i got from the Magnet < PROPFEMALE > and all the irony it's surrounded in . 
Is bald again ! 
is taking a college tour of the Northeast this summer . Where should I visit other than the obvious ones ? 
got into Constitutional Academy . Wow . 
I love how every time it's pouring rain I can only think of the rain barrels . And of how I still really need a giant funnel-like object !! 
I hope next year there's a fight over free ice cream on MY last day of high school . Seems like a fitting way to end things . 
crap . I still have to make up a 5 < PROPFEMALE > story about how my family reacted to 9/11 ! What if I just said we were in Africa then copied and pasted random African stories ? 
I don't care if today was your last day , I will mail it to you or hunt you down ! My yearbook is still gettin ' signed seniors ! You know who you are\ 
\ 
and that goes double for you < PROPFIRST > DeJesus Glasgow 
Is in TEXAS !! Everything's so big and spread out . I like it .... 
I just woke up and went \holy crap I'm in Galveston ! \ " \ 
Saw the biggest most epic mullet at < PROPFEMALE > corral today ! I was too awestruck to take pictures but it was literally all the way down the guy's back . Oh , Texas just gets better and better 
Is parked in front of a walmart listening to country music . Texas !! 
They killed Bushido Brown !!! WHY ????? 
so now that it's June , I've officially been reading Atlas Shrugged for about a year . Thanks < PROPMALE > year , thanks a lot . 
is just waiting for the right question . 
WE STILL NEED LIKE SIX MORE KIDS FOR AN AP < PROPMALE > HISTORY CLASS !!! It's an amazing class with an amazing teacher and anyone can take it . If you have the slightest interest , please go to guidance ASAP and get it on your course requests !! 
To everyone who showed interest in AP < PROPMALE > History and/or said they would switch into it , make sure it gets on your course requests AS SOON AS POSSIBLE . Like , by Tuesday/Wednesday . Let's hope this class pulls through ... 
Can someone console me for not doing Silver Knights ? I can't come up with any good ideas for a project and I just plain don't like people . Hmmmmm 
I think I'm gonna be < PROPFIRST > Black when I retire . 
So .... \ 
AP < PROPMALE > History kids , apparently Guidance didn't let anyone switch in who tried to , I guess because .... whatever . \ 
Now it's really disapproved and our Virtual Counselor course requests have been changed ( right under our noses ! ) . \ 
For whoever , like me , was banking on this class , I'm deeply deeply sorry , but you need to go to virtual counselor and contact guidance ( if they're there on Monday ) to change requests . 
When I grow up I'm going to be one of those experts that they interview for some Discovery or Science Channel special . Then , I'll know I've reached success . 
watched the series finale of The Tudors today and it wasn't as mind-blowingly satisfying as I'd hoped . Still amazing though . 
just watched Ludo's self-made music video for \Whipped Cream\ " and ..... my life is complete . " 
I don't know who to root for . There's a < PROPMALE > I might possibly have Ghanian ancestry . But then again I'll most likely never know . \ 
So go USA !! 
How long do you have to not be able to sleep for it to be considered insomnia ? I know at least one of you out there is an expert . 
I think someone owes me a BURGER , Mr. < PROPFIRST > ...... 
So today my dad and I were fixing my car and my dog wandered off . She came back twenty minutes later in a police car . In handcuffs . They found her on Fig Tree trying to sell bootleg DVDs . Oh < PROPFEMALE > ..... 
Thinking back , Mr. Houser had some pretty good jokes and puns . Good times .... 
Needs a sketch book ! This time , I'm sure . 
My senior picture is set for next Thursday ! I'm not sure if I should do something special for it or just the basic thing .... 
Did they really stop playing \Community\ " for Lebron < PROPFIRST>'s stupid announcement ?? Really ?? This was television worthy ??? They couldn't of put this online or in the commercial space ?? They felt it necessary to cancel Community in the middle of the episode ?? GAH ! " 
wants some Ameglian < PROPMALE > cows . Just to talk to .... 
This weekend was just a lot of sleeping and an obscene amount of reading . Very nice . I feel like I could've ( or should've ) done something , but ... meh . \ 
Oh , and waiting for my mixtape , Dayana LostLyric Reddick ! 
green tea < PROPFEMALE > ale = bliss 
North Korea is blank on google maps ! I wonder what's going on over there ? 
Hey Facebook , how young do I look ? \ 
The people I work with at Red Cross thought I was fourteen . There were astounded when I told them I have a car . Flabbergasted even ! \ 
Just waitin ' on that facial hair .... 
Apparently it's a huge hassle for any airline to fly from Ft . Lauderdale International to < PROPFEMALE > National , so on Sunday after I arrive in D.C. , I'll be waiting an hour and a half before any Constitutional Academy people show up . Yay ...... 
likes Admiral Ackbar jokes a little too much ... 
Just landed in DC . I passed by a Five Guys Burgers in the airport and now I can't seem to find it . Honestly , I'm kinda lost . 
Like 8 people dropped out of the class of ' 11 since the last time I checked . Now we're down to 596 , which isn't that appealing of a number to me . I preferred 604 , but you know , whatever ...... I wonder how many of us will make it through senior year ? 
We're in DC and an entire block is blocked off because a suspicious package was found . If I don't make it , I want you all to know that I've always hated you . 
really doesn't want to miss TS < PROPFEMALE > . If it became Hurricane < PROPFEMALE > , I think I would cry ..... \ 
Have fun , South Florida ! 
is going through Constitutional Academy withdrawal . This past week was leaps and bounds beyond what I'd expected . Before you get your hopes up South Floridians , I'm college touring and won't be home till Friday ...... 
In New York , we drove by a restaurant called goodburger . My childhood has come full circle . 
No mom , that is not the Cash Cab . NONE OF THESE ARE THE CASH CAB !!! Jeezus . 
There were well over 100 people at the MIT info session/tour this morning . The one black guy : yours truly . 
was gone for two weeks and came home to 27 parcels of college mail , tinted windows ( finally ! ) , and a kickass sound system in my car . Love my parents ! 
Just dug up the AP Lit summer reading packet from some dark corner of my room , so the fun's basically over . Apparently I have to start reading literature like a college professor . \ 
Or I could just continue not giving a shit , cause that's worked out great for the past eight weeks . 
spent the past week downloading and reading the entire < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim series ( on my iPhone ! ) . This week's mission : try to possibly attempt caring about doing AP Lit summer reading ! 
I like to think that < PROPFEMALE > Palin is actually a genius who created and maintains an over the top character/ facade purely for satirical reasons . Sort of like < PROPFIRST > Colbert but taken much farther . At least , that's how I sleep at night . 
Hey Facebook , I need a bunch adjectives describing me . GO ! 
I'll be immersing myself in jazz for the next week . Any suggestions ? 
HAPPY DAY !! < PROPFIRST > Cera didn't ruin the movie !!! < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim was SO great I honestly can't decide whether or not the books were better .

1168 pages , 14 months ; 1 objectivist philosophy . For the entirety of < PROPMALE > year , you've weighted both my backpack and my psyche . But now , at 5:15 on this dull august morning , I can honestly say that I'm done with you , \Atlas Shrugged . \ " I've made it all the way through Ayn Rand's articulate 
\You should be a writer for the Adult Swim bumps . They sound so much like you . \ " \ 
Got parking spot #18 ! That's good luck , right ? 
Forgot to make up for all that sleep I lost < PROPMALE > year . I guess that's what Senior year is for .

So in case no one pays attention to the morning announcements , the first NHS Meeting is Monday . Be there or be square . 
exists ! 
Maybe the announcement reader in the front office just hates NHS but whatever . Next meeting on Tuesday . Tell your friends . Or your enemies . As long as they're in NHS . 
I apologize for the short notice ( and not making this status earlier ) , but the NHS meeting is moved to Wednesday ! 
So far seven colleges have waived my application fee . If only one that I'm actually planning on applying to would ....

Finally completed the CommonApp . Now , to be really really nervous for the next five months ... 
Just voted two years from now !
