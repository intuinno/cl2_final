I noticed that all my friends from California have friends who are mostly Asian xD the rest are Mexican . Not being racist ... xD 
I remember in 4th grade , one of my buddies got off the bus and had to pee . There was a ditch nearby , so I told him to go in there , so he did . Then he climbed up , and i pointed out that there was a gas station right across the street . xD

My room is a mess . 
Poor kid . We were at wahooz and some kid stuck gum in my brother's hair . He was afraid of being embarassed , so we used our tickets to get green shutters for him . It's so cute and funny xD 
I cant wait to tell someone about what I just did !!! INTENSE !! 
I've been listening to music , watching videos , and reading books that I haven't touched in a long time . When I do , I get a feeling in the pit of my stomach . The lighting changes , and I find myself in the exact setting that I was in at that time . Such vivid memories make me feel like I should live life to the fullest . Have more memories like that ...

sooo fun . so fun [[: 
Summer ... -sighh- 
Fact : Chickens grown for our consumption are overfed food and antibiotics until they are unnaturally large . Their legs can't hold up their body weight and break . Unable to move , they just lay there where they die of starvation and infection . We eat those ones too . 
Just watched The Lovely Bones ! I'm still shaking from all the suspense ! 
You're unique .... just like everyone else . 
Another fact : Pigs bred for food , like chickens , are overfed under their legs can't bear their own body weight . Piglets are mutilated by having their ears and tails cut off by people who don't seem to notice their earsplitting squeals . Wear they live , they have no room to walk or even turn . They are already dead by the time they get to the slaughterhouse . 
This was by far the worst school year ever . I'm so happy it happened .. [ : 
\I just want everybody to know hat I'm not a lame loser . I'm a cool loser ! hehehe ! That was lame ... \ " LOL :D "

Sticky notes are fun ;D 
Listening to Motionless in White . No school tomorrow . Tired as hell . Facebook is boring . Bye .

#2468101269 . Oh , where do I start ? Haha . Well , when I thought everyone at Compass were the same and boring , I never made an effort to make any friends , but then I met you , and you're freaking hilarious . In a way , you got me to become more social and I learned A LOT about other people and myself . You made my Compass days worth remembering . [: 
#12321 you're hilariously random . I couldn't stop laughing at you in Cornerstone yesterday . Haha . Also , I like your hair . It's like so ... whooooshh . 
#52 I remember when we met in 4th grade and I thought you were really stuck up , but then I think we became friends during the Oregon trail project and I started to realize how cool you were :D We were like best friends in 6th grade . I think you're so fun to be around and you're so real . Like , you don't even try to \fit in\ " and that makes you so likeable . I'm sooo glad we go to the same school again :D "

Is that normal ? 
Middle school boys aggravate me -____- 
Who wants to hanggg ? [ :\ 
Text me ? 
When I'm scrolling down my news feed , I normally scroll past the statuses that say \comment the new pictures\ " without going to comment the new pictures . \ 
I panic when I can't find my chapstick . That's not normal , is it ? 
Facebook is no longer interesting . \ 
I haven't received a text message since tuesday . \
