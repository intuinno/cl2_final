Joke I heard today . ( Re : USA ) One year ago we had < PROPMALE > Hope and < PROPFIRST > Cash , now we have no hope and no cash ! 
Just back from Penn State Winterfest 2010 Concert . Newsong , Newsboys , and THIRD DAY ( my personal fav ! ) and several other bands . Kids had a blast , < PROPFIRST > got his music on and it was GREAT ! 
Whoops - it's Winter JAM 2010 , not fest . 
FRONT-END LOADERS ROCK ! So much snow I can't believe it , TEXANS should NEVER see this !. We are all shoveling every few hours so we can get out if we need to - then who shows up - Man with a front-end loader ! Did the whole driveway , front of mail-box - I am in love ! Don't tell < PROPFIRST > . 
Just considering where time disappears to ... < PROPFEMALE > is 10 , < PROPFIRST > is 12 , < PROPMALE > is 14 - all this month ! I miss the babies , but I love watching them grow into these strange , fearless , opinionated people . 
NEWSFLASH - < PROPFIRST > broke his ankle , here we go again ! WooHoo 
Since Feb-Adam broken ankle , everyone sick , Emily-Nat . < PROPMALE > Soc ., Owen-suspended ( didn't start it , but ended it ) , pediatrician , tutoring , Adam-MRI , Owen-new friends , severe allergies ( who knew !?? ) , Dale-sleep apnea/needs a new band , dentist ( only a parent has a cavity-sheesh ) , < PROPFIRST > too much PS-grounded . Adam-4 more weeks of crutches/physical therapy , Owen-braces , Emily-learner's permit , EVERYONE swimming by SUMMER ! 
Apparently , per < PROPFEMALE>'s spanish-speaking friend , I have been calling my kids a VERY bad name , several times a day - all their lives . I kinda feel bad , but then again , it's pretty funny ! My mom apparently picked this little gem up from her mom - finally , the cycle ends .

Just waiting around for my next embarassing moment . I take exception to the fact that my manicurist found < PROPMALE > n cheese under my fingernails the other night . That's just gross . 
I say NEVER when my doctor wants to adjust the Synthroid ! If it's working - then NO ! NO ! NO ! If I'm in HEART ATTACK range , maybe we'll talk . So after that phone call , she's probably considering a PSYCH referral :) ... Do they have hot tubs there ? 
I want to go home . I miss my front porch . 
I am so glad this school year is OVER !!! I am ready for sunshine , hot weather and any body of water . If it rains at my house , I'm in the car and heading as far south as necessary for blue skies ! I am going to try and get through the summer without turning my stove on - bless the sandwich ! 
So far , we've hit Fuller Lake , Cunningham Falls , and tomorrow is Cowan's Gap ! Miss the boys - they are at CREATION 2010 until Sunday , catching up with all the fav bands . LOVE having Andie , < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > ! Just missing < PROPFEMALE > Girl ! 
School starts Monday . I'm never ready - my summer ' to do ' list is still way too long ! 
I hate it when my kids are grounded . It's so BORING ! Why don't I dish out punishments that I can live with ... 
I am planning my trip home ! YAY ! Hoping to see < PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE > with < PROPFEMALE > and Mom ! 
< PROPFEMALE > is going to get her Learner's Permit tomorrow morning . I'm sorta glad ... 
No permit for < PROPFEMALE > Saturday . The intrusive state of < PROPFEMALE > wants a physical first . Anyone else ever heard of this ? I think it's a little much . It's not like she went in wearing a brace or something ... 
Had a terrific time with < PROPFEMALE > and her friends at the Melting Pot last night ! 
Spent the day at the emergency room with < PROPFIRST > - thank God it wasn't appendicitis ! Still , not the most fun Monday ever ! Bring on Tuesday !
