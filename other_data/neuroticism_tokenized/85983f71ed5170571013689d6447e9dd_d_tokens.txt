Things aren’t the way they were before\ 
You wouldn’t even recognize me anymore\ 
Not that you knew me back then\ 
But it all comes back to me\ 
In the end\ 
You kept everything inside and even though I tried , it all fell apart\ 
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so hard 
november 9th . the reveal . :O

Time to compose my final project . I hope it doesn't sound like poop 
If every < PROPFEMALE > fell out of the sky tonight\ 
Every wish I’d make would take me closer to you\ 
Have you ever wanted something so bad it hurts ? \ 
To never wake from the world that you once knew 
And I find I kind of funny \ 
I find it kind of sad \ 
The dreams in which I’m dying are the best I’ve ever had \ 
I find it hard to tell you \ 
I find it hard to take \ 
When people run in circles its a very very \ 
Mad world \ 
Mad world 
But I'm on the outside\ 
And I'm looking in\ 
I can see through you\ 
See your true colors\ 
' Cause inside you're ugly\ 
You're ugly like me ... \ 
See to the real you 
Happy veteran's day , dad :)

When you'd scream , I'd fight away all of your fears . \ 
And I held your hand through all of these years . \

Go away ! \ 
You don't know what it's like to be dead inside . 
I'm looking at you through the glass\ 
Don't know how much time has passed\ 
Oh God it feels like forever\ 
But no one ever tells you that forever feels like home\ 
Sitting all alone inside your head . 
All that lies in me , \ 
All that dies in me . \ 
How can I live without you ? 
< PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > are over . Epic win 
Do you think of me ? \ 
Do you dream of me ? \ 
I always dream about you .

Find your post , find your shelter in hopes of outliving the undead . \ 
Build your walls , maintain protection with ambitions of beating the odds . 
We cannot restore . We cannot recover . All is lost in the flood of the risen undead . 
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes , I have to turn my head until my darkness goes 
So I found this really awesome album , and I just found out it came out on my birthday :D 
build your walls maintain protection

Is DETERMINED to make good grades these 9 weeks
