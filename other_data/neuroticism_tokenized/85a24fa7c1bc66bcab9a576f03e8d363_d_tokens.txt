While you SCREAM at your woman , there's a man wishing he could whisper softly in her ear . While you HUMILIATE , OFFEND & INSULT her , there's a man flirting with her & reminding her how beautiful she is . While you HURT your woman , there's a man wishing he could take her pain away .... While you make your woman CRY , there's a man stealing her smiles . Post this on your wall if you're against Domestic Violence . 
PROMISE TO MY KIDS : I will stalk you , freak out on you , lecture you , drive you crazy , be your worst nightmare , embarass you in front of your friends , hunt you down like a bloodhound because I LOVE YOU !!!!!! When you understand that , I will know you are a responsible ADULT . You will NEVER find someone who loves , cares , and worries about you more than your MOM !!!!!! REPOST THIS IF YOU ARE A MOM !!! 
A true friend doesn't care when you're broke , being a bitch , what you weigh , if your house is a mess , what you drive , about your past , or if your family is filled with crazy people . Your conversations pick up where they left off , even if they have been months apart . They love you for who you are . Re-post if you have at least one true friend . They will know who they are . 
I'm selfish , impatient and a little insecure . I make mistakes , I am out of control and at times hard to handle . But if you can't handle me at my worst , then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best . \ — < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > Interest " 
I don't need an angel on my Christmas tree , I already have a bunch in Heaven looking down on me ..... Put this in your status if there is someone in Heaven you wish could be with you this Christmas . Miss you all , everyday !! Keep watching over us !! 
Holidays are tough ... I wish heaven had a phone ... so I could hear your voice again . I thought of you today ... but that is nothing new . I thought of you yesterday and days before that too . I think of you in silence and often speak your name . All I have are memories and pictures in a frame ... repost if you have someone in heaven that you miss on earth . --- 
203 I am thankful for the mother and wife that you are . We are lucky to have you as part of our family ! Love you 
? Everyperson has 1000 wishes , a cancer patient only has one , to get better . I know that 97% of you won't post this as your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do . In honor of someone who died , or is fighting cancer post this for at least one hour
