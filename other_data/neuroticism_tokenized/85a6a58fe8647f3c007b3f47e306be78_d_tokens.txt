I've seen this episode 4 times and I'm still sobbing at the end . The things I do because I love < PROPFEMALE > Kish 
And yet I have had the weakness , and still have the weakness , to wish you to know with what a sudden mastery you kindled me , heap of ashes that I am , into fire . 
That awkward momen when you're listening to Every < PROPFEMALE > , Every Planet and brushing your teeth feels like you're saving the whole freaking world ... and then you realize you're not .

I will rain down silver and gold for you . I will shatter the black night , break it open , and pour out a million stars . Turn away from the darkness , the madness , and the pain . Open your eyes . And know that I am here . That I remember and hope . Open your eyes and look at the light . 
Sometimes I wake up and look like the lion from the Wizard of Oz . Except without all the fur and the cool tail . 
He is like fire , burning through time . As old a forever but fast in his prime . 
I wear a Stetson now . Stetson's are cool .
