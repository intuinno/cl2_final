< PROPFEMALE > Conundrum\ 
My puppy has made friends with a stray kitten . It comes over everyday , sneaks in through the doggie door and eats Izzy's dog food . They play on the porch and < PROPMALE > each other around the backyard . I don't like cats , but I worry about what will happen to Izzy's friend as the weather turns cold . I've tried to catch the kitten , to take it to the animal shelter to no avail . Now what do I do ? 
This Is Just To Say\ 
I have eaten\ 
the plums\ 
that were in\ 
the icebox\ 
\ 
and which\ 
you were probably\ 
saving\ 
for breakfast\ 
Forgive me\ 
they were delicious\ 
so sweet\ 
and so cold -- < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > s\ 
This poem always comes to mind when I eat plums . 
< PROPFEMALE > Update\ 
Well , the < PROPFEMALE > is now trapped somewhere in the house . Last night I must have locked it in . When I heard it hit the glass patio door I opened it up it was scared and ran and hid . Haven't seen it since . Hopefully I can catch it and take it to the shelter . - good times 
< PROPFEMALE > is at the shelter . whoo hoo

How creative are you ?... Leave a 1-word comment that best describes me using the THIRD letter of your first name . It can only be 1-word .... then copy this to your wall so I can do the same ..... Don't leave a word & not copy .... that's NO fun ! 
There's something fabulous about this new year ! Like universal WD-40 , unsticking , and allowing for freedom and movement .
