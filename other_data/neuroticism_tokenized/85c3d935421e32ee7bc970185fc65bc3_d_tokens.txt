As your body needs nourishment - food , drink , sleep , so does your soul need nourishment - sing , dance , love . Life is not all work , work is not all hard toil . Nourish your soul with the food that is right for it , for it is the altar of your own inner < PROPFEMALE >

that your ability to receive is equally important to your ability to give . Have you ever brought a special gift , working hard just to get it , only to be refused by the person you were giving it to ? That didn't feel right , did it ? .................. 
Our relationships are greatly enhanced when we become not only generous givers , but generous receivers as well . When we know how to accept gladly , wholeheartedly , embracing the gift as an extension of the giver . It takes both giving and receiving for care and generosity to flow unimpeded ......... Love U chelle miss u Boo tc as always goog words from ur faith thanks

There is no need to worry if you encounter deep emotions today . It's tempting to step into the murky shadows , for you may believe that you can gain a new perspective . But don't stay in the dark too long . Why spend so much time in an unfriendly environment when transformational beauty is nearby ? Learn your lesson and then move on .

that when you do the right thing , it will feel good in your body . Your body never lies . When you feel stress in your body , something is out of balance in your life . Restore the balance , and your body and spirit will reflect the rightness of your choice ...... thanks < PROPFEMALE > 
The High Priestess is My card today ... You are challenged to use your intuition more skillfully than ever before . The card that lands in the Challenges/Opportunities position refers to ways that you can turn obstacles into stepping stones . The High Priestess in this position indicates that you are now testing the skills you have been developing . 
Here is an opportunity to determine how well your inner labors have paid off . Has your intuitive receptivity guided you through the unpredictability and distractions of daily life ? Have your inner talents translated into decision and action ? Once you see the links and contrasts between what you know in your heart and what life presents you , ask yourself what you want to do about it . 
You may not be good at completely restraining yourself today , but self-discipline can be a very effective strategy , even in small doses . It's not that you are so over the top ; it's just that you could commit to delivering more than you can handle now . You can ruin a good thing if you accept too much responsibility too quickly . At least , think twice before saying yes . 
... that there is no way to happiness , happiness is the way . Happiness does not come from seeking new landscapes , but from having new eyes on the same life you've always been living ...... had to repost this chelle < PROPFEMALE > :)

While we live in a < PROPMALE > Universe that allows us to manifest , it is important to stay humble . Sometimes , we ask for what we want & the Universe loves us enough not to deliver because there is something better & more suited for us . While we are all powerful beings , ultimately , we are not in total control . Today , \I honor my place in the Universe & surrender to the Divine Plan . \"" 
what to do what to do gotta choose a path to follow and stick it through , time will tell and wont be long gonna gett it on and move along :) 
Differences between Hardtek , Tribe , Hardfloor , Tribecore : Hardtek is generally ' pure ' techno at hardcore speed . Tribe is the same thing except it layers breaks over the top just like old 4-beat hardcore , aswell as addng tribal beats . Hardfloor is basically just sped up reverse-bassline hardstyle to hardcore speed . Tribecore is a hybird of Hardfloor ? and Tribe , but generally with a lighter reverse-bass , 
Sometimes we believe we are being of service through compromise when , in reality , we are masking our fears of moving forward . When you are called to move forward , always seek the barriers within & all the forms they may take . Your spirit , is your direct connection to the Universe which will pull you forward if you will only allow It . Today , \I ask to see the Truth about myself & the courage to integrate that Truth . \"" 
Until the sun rises to burn our eyes by revealing the distopian reality of a world you've created for us , we dance fiercely with our brothers and sisters in celebration of our life , of our culture , and of the values we believe in : Peace , Love , Freedom , Tolerance , Unity , < PROPFEMALE > , Expression , Responsibility and Respect .

In the stillness of a pause , take a deep breath & feel your deep connection to the Universe . All that you need is being orchestrated for you while you sit in your connectedness . Today , \Being still is a necessary action . \"" 
Is it possible that almost everyone i know truly just sucks and is and has always only in singular plurality been out for and solely interested in nothing but themselves ???

HMMM , lets see who just says hello for no other reason than just that :) 
No task is without purpose . Even the smallest morsel is meant for consumption , though one should be careful not to overwhelm the appetite with trifles , spoiling the enjoyment of a main course . Appetites , after all , are meant for managing so that they may serve you the best , lest you be the one served up instead . And you know very well what comes after that 
pokey pokey dokey dokey LMAO :) 
that all is well . All is going according to plan . Trust that there is a bigger picture . Trust that life is unfolding as it should . TRUST :)

Dark Angel ....... You are kind to those you deem worthy . You can manipulate nightmares and emotions . You were once human but ascended below the Arc Angels . 
Embrace your power & don't be afraid of it . There may be people who fear your power because they are being forced to see their own greatness while observing you in yours . Remember that living in your power is the greatest form of giving , a gift you give to yourself & the world . As you give , so shall you recieve . Today , \I fearlessly step into my power . \"" 
Conscious relationships are based on reciprocity . Be a giver without motive . Give without the need for approval or a < PROPFIRST > on the back . Only allow people into your life who operate from this same place & there will be a natural flow of giving & receiving . Without this flow , you run the risk of draining your life force . Today , \My primary relationships are based in the Divine flow of giving & receiving . \"" 
Our greatest teachers are the people we frequently judge to be our enemies , and the circumstances we judge to be catastrophes . It is not what is done to us , but only how we allow it to affect us that truly matters . Contemplate this ....

When you feel like you have gotten off track , remember , you are only lacking in perspective . In a Universe where there are no mistakes , detachment , faith & open mindedness are what is required of you . When things feel as though they are falling apart , they are really falling together . Today , \The way is being paved for a miracle . \"" 
' Wisdom is knowing what to do next ; skill is knowing how to do it , and virtue is doing it . ' - 
You have a great deal of power within , and you can accomplishanything as long as you aren't afraid to use it . Don't fear failure . If you never try , you'll never succeed . If you see missing pieces in the plan , Trust that things will fall into place as needed . Keep your eyes on the prize .

Most of us , most of the time , allow our ego-programming to run our lives . The ego cannot fathom lasting happiness . Ego will permit temporary pleasure , but will not engender feelings of humility , deep heartfelt gratitude , unselfish love and true bliss . Ego-living is not the source of happiness , and never can be . ~ ~ 
You always hold the answers you need to move forward . Are you so in tune with yourself that you avoid looking & mask your answers for fear of taking action ? Taking full repsonsibility for yourself takes high levels of courage . Be clear ; are you avoiding your life changing for fear of the unknown & pretending to not know ? Today , \I go within & act with courage . I am fully supported in my life . \"" 
All of us internally generate the out there reality we believe is so real . On the other hand , general consenses drives most of us to a common agreement of what constitutes the out there reality . Try approaching almost anything from a different point of view ... it is hard , but doable , and the results may confound you . Afterall , we ultimately decide how every interaction will affect us . 
Your happiness comes down to one thing ; perception . Perception is everything . A cup half filled is both half full & half empty simulateously . Both are True statments . Avoid judging right from wrong & decide which perception is a springboard for greater fulfillment . Either way you might want more water , but with the cup half full you are almost there . Today , \I choose perceptions that are supportive of my happiness . \"" 
We must all believe that thought affects us on all levels , physical , mental & spiritual . CHALLENGE the long held BELIEFS that certain things make us sick , lose money or cause us suffering & come to REALIZE that is is our own thoughts that AFFECT & CHANGE these areas of our lives . SEE our lives as we want them to be , EXPECT it to be that way & ALLOW those things to come to use , then ALL OF US CAN HAVE THE WORLD ... 
and it is true silliness that makes the world a \ 
livable place and worth seeing what tomorrow \ 
will bring !!!

Say a prayer of gratitude when you don't get what you want . The amazing thing about this wise Universe is that it always delivers through Its perception of you ; beautiful & valuable . Your perception of yourself is limited by comparison . Therefore , when you don't get what you want know that something even better could be be in store Today , \I am grateful . \"" 
Engage people with what they expect ; it is what they are able to discern and confirms their projections . It settles them into predictable patterns of response , occupying their minds while you wait for the extraordinary moment — that which they cannot anticipate .

... wealth does not come from your bank account , wealth comes from the depth of your heart . 
Never be afraid to try something new . Remember , amateurs built the ark ; professionals built the Titanic . 
Let grace and goodness be the principal loadstone of thy affections . For love which hath ends , will have an end ; whereas that which is founded on true virtue , will always continue . 
To think bad thoughts is really the easiest thing in the world . If you leave your mind to itself it will spiral down into ever-increasing unhappiness . To think good thoughts , however , requires effort . This is one of the things that discipline — training — is about .

A master in the < PROPMALE > of living draws no sharp distinction between his work and his play ; his labor and his leisure ; his mind and his body ; his education and his recreation . He hardly knows which is which . He simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever he is doing , and leaves others to determine whether he is working or playing . To himself , he always appears to be doing both . ~

Why do giant monsters eat people ? Human beings are mostly water . Their tissues and fluids retain flavors and other residues from their blood . Their bones have a brittle quality .

Besides the < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > of getting things done , there is the < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > of leaving things undone . The wisdom of life consists in the elimination of non-essentials . 
At the still point of the turning world . Neither flesh nor fleshless ; Neither from nor towards ; at the still point , there the dance is , But neither arrest nor movement . And do not call it fixity , Where past and future are gathered . Neither movement from nor towards , Neither ascent nor decline . Except for the point , the still point , There would be no dance , and there is only the dance . ~ T . S . Eliot 
Power isn't always evil . If you stand tall in the power of goodness , you can have a powerful impact on a situation . 
Consultnot your fears but your hopes and your dreams . Think not about your frustrations , but about your unfulfilled potential . Concern yourself notwith what you tried and failed in , but with what it is still possible for you to do . ~

The truth is that my work is to shatter the faith of men here , there , and everywhere , faith in affirmation , faith in negation , and faith in abstention in faith , and this for the sake of faith in faith itself ; it is to war against all those who submit , whether it be to Catholicism , or to rationalism , or to agnosticism ; it is to make all men live the life of inquietude and passionate desire . ~ < PROPMALE > de Unamuno ~ 
I am incapable of conceiving infinity , and yet I do not accept finity . I want this adventure that is the context of my life to go on without end . ~ 
My intent is to tell the truth as I know it , realizing that what is true for me may be blasphemy for others . ~ 
I like not only to be loved , but also to be told that I am loved . I am not sure that you are of the same mind . But the realm of silence is large enough beyond the grave . This is the world of light and speech , and I shall take leave to tell you that you are very dear . ~ 
If the problem has a solution , worrying is pointless , in the end the problem will be solved . If the problem has no solution , there is no reason to worry , because it can't be solved .

Earn more , achieve more , be more successful , do all of these things and you may yet be unhappy . Love more , forgive more , give more . Do this and you will find that joy which never fades .
