new years < PROPFEMALE > with < PROPFEMALE > :) 

watching glee with my mom ... 
is at < PROPFEMALE>'s! 
finally went to the library again :) i'm such a dork ... 
finally finished wrapping presents 
there wasn't a sunset today :( 
Somebody made a fake formspring one letter off from my real one and with my picture ... Wow . 
< PROPMALE > python and the holy Grail . Best way to ring in the new year ever . 
Penguin huddling with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Horowitz , < PROPFIRST > Dooley South , and < PROPFIRST > Horowitz to start the new year off right :D 
overwhelmed 
now that i've woken up from an extremely long nap i should probably start my homework ... 
why do i always feel like i'm going insane when i listen to system of a down ... and between the buried and me has that effect too ... maybe i should listen to normal music -_- 
i just had to explain to my sister that europe is a continent not part of the United States , and that no , australia is not part of russia 
i really need to get better at sleeping at the right times ... today i fell asleep for an hour at moonstone park and then another hour on a bench >.< 
feeling bad again about something that happened a while ago 
i am now in london O.o 
spent the afternoon at the portabello road market 
just had tea and an excellent chocolate muffin after taking a late night walk with my family :) 
anybody know the homework assignment for hamilton's algebra 2 ? 
no pandora outside the US ?! not fair 
finding money in your pocket is always great ... unless , of course , it's a dollar and you can't do anything with it because it's foreign currency >.< 
went to the tower of london today , i never knew it was so big ! 
i ? the snow . so much better than the rain everyone in redondo is getting :P 
anybody know what hamilton's algebra 2 homework is ? 
it's < PROPFIRST>'s day . great -_- 
early morning >.< going to class kind of soon 
off to a 3 hour college psych class -_- 
i'm scared ... my 11 year old sister just came out out of our room with red eyeshadow on and black eyeshadow underneath her eyes , not to mention the sparkles all over her face ... 
skyping with < PROPFIRST > watching disney sing-a-long videos on youtube :D 
watched pancake racing this afternoon . and yes ... i meant to write ' pancake racing ' O.o 
just tried to get myself a 2am snack ... started to poured myself a bowl of raw pasta noodles . whoops ... i guess i'm a little tired >.< 
leaving for < PROPFIRST > and rome this morning :) should be fun 
took the chunnel to < PROPFIRST > this morning- went to the eiffel tower , saw the louvre , went shopping , ate at some great caffes , and had an excellent dinner . i like this city :) 
< PROPFIRST > is absolutely amazing ... 
leaving for rome early tomorrow morning . < PROPFIRST > was absolutely amazing :D i swear there isn't any bad food in this entire city ... 
really really REALLY craving lbj's . or any mexican food actually , but especially lbj's 
good morning ? going to class in a little . bleh >.< 
college students are failures . if a 14-year-old who missed the first three weeks of class can get the best test grade in the class ... there is something very wrong . 
a lecture on Freudian psychology can be a bit awkward when your dad is the professor ... psychosexual development , anyone ? electra complex ? >.< 
i hate the fact that i'm short when i have to take the underground during rush hour . my face either gets pressed into somebody's back or armpit , and i can't see a thing because everyone else is so much bigger than me >.< 
my friend just got me to listen to < PROPFIRST > swift ... i am now recovering by having him listen to parkway drive . he thinks it's ' s<PROPFIRST>' . but it's actually good music :P 
oh wow i was just on skype until 5 in the morning ... 
so i figured that since i'm still awake , i might as well have breakfast . i am now sitting on my kitchen floor eating a delicious pain au chocolate . 
everything you love . fucking dies . 
i just spent as much time at starbucks as i would have in class if i went to school O.o 
only in my family do you get conversations during dinner on < PROPMALE>'s theory of evolution , cannibalism , calculus , flying teapots , led zeppelin , and if it's theoretically possible to prove my sister isn't an alien ... 
had PANCAKES for breakfast ! this was a special thing ... not many of those around here . and went to < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE>'s house afterwords . good day :D 
so apparently time differences and daylight savings are more complicated than i thought . all you guys in california lost an hour , but here daylight savings doesn't happen for another two weeks . weird ... 
Fantastic Mr. Fox is one of the weirdest movies i have ever seen ... and also has the most cussing ? 
i didn't have dinner , because i'm so sick of italian food since going to rome that i refused to eat pizza . this may have been a bad idea ... now i'm hungry and it's almost 2 in the morning >.< 
today it was so warm , the high was 50 ! and i only had to wear one jacket instead of two :) ... just because all of you are so excited to have 80 degree weather and go to the beach ... 
i didn't even know it was st. patrick's day until is saw a group of drunk guys walking down the street with big green guinness top-hats on O.o 
i love how the bus driver in cambridge let me ride for free because i'm under five ... 
the purple skittles outside of the US are blackcurrant ? what the hell is a blackcurrant ... 
i am unable to comprehend how people can believe in creationism over evolutionary theory . it actually frightens me . 
hanging out and microwaving ice cream with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > and my sister . oh and sticking our heads out of the window into the rain O.o 
i should probably go to bed soon ... i can already here the birds chirping outside , and the sun's coming up soon . 
yesterday i go to bed at 5am , today i wake up at 4am . i believe there may be something wrong with my sleeping habits ... 
kept falling asleep in psych this morning , so i drank half of a guy's redbull . needless to say , i was very awake for the second half of the class ... i forgot how strongly energy drinks affect me . 
received a most excellent package today from < PROPFIRST > Dooley South , < PROPFIRST > Ruskin ( who i've never talked to in my life ... ) , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Horowitz , < PROPFIRST > M Levine , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , and < PROPFEMALE > Ezzes ; yes , all those names were in the return address . it contained SAMOAS , < PROPFEMALE > , wonderful letters from people , and a spectacular drawing by < PROPFIRST > :D 
i positively absolutely HATE < PROPFIRST > beiber . and my ipod isn't loud enough to drown out the music videos my sister is listening to over and over . i think this is the best form of torture ever created . 
a message from your best friend saying he fucking hates you and you're a little bitch has to be the worst fucking thing in the world to wake up to . things are only going to go down from here . here i come depression ... and who will be there to help me ? definitely not him . 
i wake up to find out that no , spring is not here , there's freezing rain outside instead . great . 
rain . more rain . and then some rain after that . 
finally saw < PROPFEMALE > in wonderland :) 
this is why it's better not to care ... 
went to The Boat Race between oxford and cambridge today ... damn those guys row fast O.o 
i'm definitely not a normal teenager ... because no normal teenager goes to bed at 10 and wakes up at 5 every day by their own choice . yet i do . what a freak . 
i don't think it's a good thing when the washing machine moves across the kitchen floor on it's own ... i thought it was an earthquake at first . then realized there are no earthquakes here . and then got REALLY scared O.o 
i find it slightly unsettling that the author of a book where the main character attempts suicide actually committed suicide a couple weeks after the book was published . 
mexican food in london just isn't the same ... i can't even figure out what the tortillas ( or as they're called here , fajita wraps ? ) were made of . i want lbj's :( 
i never thought i would actually like journalling ... but it's strangely enjoyable to just be able to get my thoughts out of my head . and without telling them to anyone . 
taking the train to stratford-upon-avon later this morning . then going to warwick castle , and then oxford . i guess i kind of am going on a spring break trip :) 
might not get to come home on time because of volcanic ash :/ 
united airline flights are cancelled until at least this thursday :/ 
\so the church of england was an ecclesiastical pimp \"- tour guide at the Globe " 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > was fucking AMAZING ! 
< PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > in Stratford-Upon-Avon . train rides make me sleepy and i inevitably fall asleep . 
almost completely packed , can't wait to come home :) but i will definitely miss it here too . 
last day in london . home tomorrow . 
getting off now . goodbye london ... coming home :) 
home :) actually the airport ... but home soon . 
Mexican food :) For the first time in months 
it didn't take me long to go back to my old habits :/ 
there are weird people at CVS in the middle of the night ... 
Well i'm just a mess today aren't i 
It's awkward when death reads your text messages over your shoulder 
Somebody . Anybody . Help ... 
My sister wants green mascara ... 
getting woken up by dancing penguins at < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Horowitz's house 
Why did i choose late sunday night to completely clean out my room 
loving how people talk shit but don't actually do anything :) 
Visiting my second , third , and fourth grade teachers :) 
in-n-out is quite good :) 
this weekend definitely could have gone better 
haha why not . If you \like\ " this status I will post on your wall something I like about you . Make this your status if you want a challenge . " 
if crying is a sign of weakness ... i'm very weak . 
wow . the one time i actually want to work on homework it's impossible for me to . feeling a bit nerdy and pathetic right now ... 
Well that was an unexpected end to my night 
today a fly actually flew into my eye . not where you think it does but you blink and it's gone . i actually had to remove this nasty little fly from my eye . this would happen to me ... 
that didn't exactly help 
my mom just texted me asking me if i was coming home for dinner . i'm at home , in my room -_- 
my mom thinks i'm insane for not wholeheartedly believing in telepathy . wow . 
Freedom of religion doesn't exist . and neither does freedom of speech . never ever be under the illusion that they do . because they don't , and probably never will . 
Hmmm some man just asked me if i wanted to go to a barbecue ... no thanks ? 
just ran into < PROPFEMALE > Dente on my way home ... i love you girl <3 
and this will be the easiest day of finals ever . 
It's finally over :) 
Night didn't turn out so awful after all 
Funny how life just goes in circles 
epic poke war with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Horowitz 
an eventful day of sailing ... 
Nothing can go right tonight can it :( 
i really really hate how music can remind you of things and bring back unpleasant memories . i need to find new music to listen to ... any suggestions ? 
Oh this is definitely fun -_- 
really want my rings back 
failed epicly at fishing today 
Got my rings back :D 
i love how going to bed early means going to bed at 1 in the morning instead of 5 in the morning ... i seriously need to get back to sleeping normally 
Why why why is there a possum under my bed ... 
Is so good at fucking shit up and making everything go wrong 
Does anyone know what you have to do to get excommunicated ? 
Ran out of black nailpolish :( dark grey will be okay i guess 
oh , i love it when my mom Takes the phone from me to talk to my boyfriend in a tennassee accent and he's talking back in an < PROPFEMALE > accent ... 
my mom and i were talking about safe sex commercials at dinner . apparently my sister thought we were taking about ' save sex ' commercials ... hmmm ... 
< PROPFIRST > Ireland is my slave :) 
apparently the solution to a kid who keeps watching you make out with your boyfriend is to shoot them with an airsoft gun ... that makes them go away if nothing else will 
went sailing on the farr 40 and saw sooo many whales . amazing . 
Deep fried oreos are actually pretty good 
me < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > Hill just had a craque fight . Quin Olsson you wish you were here . hahahahahahahhaha . craque . 
im in love with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > 
Laying in bed listening to music with my black candles lit . for once a night i'm not stressed about homework (: 
so < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > really , REALLY likes cuddling . in her sleep . hmmmmmm . 
Feeling happy and relaxed for absolutely no reason at all (: 
bored ... like this status and i'll say what i like about you 
editing a non-honors english paper is an entirely different experience from everything i'm used to . haha wow ... this is kinda fun actually ? 
it's already starting O.o oh < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > 
according to < PROPFEMALE > we're in a mexican village right now . 
can't believe i was just asked whether or not i'm tall enough to go on roller coasters -_- 
\i'm priceless ... unless you buy me for the night . \ " - < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > " 
loves sitting by herself at lunch . and hates being called a whore . 
BTBAM is soooooo strange . but i really like it (: 
Just got 2 cartilage piercings 
Creepy guy named < PROPFIRST > walked for about a mile with me and < PROPFEMALE > . VERY creepy . wtf . 
I really want something to do tonight -_- 
is a lesbian and o one loves her 
is i love women 
disclaimer : anything posted from my facebook all day was not me . includes any statuses , comments , or wall posts . 
i should probably study for the psat . but i'm feeling incredibly unmotivated right now . 
quite enjoying the company of this cat that isn't even mine (: 
is it a bad thing that it's late october and i can still only remember my precalc teacher's name by first thinking about the word morbid and then making the association ? 
things are sliding backwards to where they were last year ... damn . 
< PROPFEMALE > hill is the light of my life . 
on the bright side , at least my my mom didn't end up rehearsing for her prostitute scene in the living room like she said she would . 
got my heading typed for my essay . at least it's a start . it's taken me hours to get around to that point . 
some people just need to realize when to let go . seriously . 
i would just like to inform Happy < PROPFIRST > Veliz and < PROPMALE > Krank that i don't lose poke wars . EVER (: 
doing absolutely nothing for halloween weekend ... how fun . 
With the best nigger in the world 
Last night turned out much better than expected . 
< PROPFIRST > of the dead is an excellent movie (: 
you're not going to win this < PROPFIRST > Fortson 
It's funny because I actually thought you might be different . Silly naive me . 
Bullet for My < PROPFIRST > <3 
Got thrown in the harbor for my birthday in the dark . Freezing . 
Sorry to inform you , but it is NOT Christmas . 
tiffany : we should go get muffins tomorrow . \ 
me : from where ? \ 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Fabian : ... the muffin man ? 
it's so hard to care about anything anymore 
I can hear my family watching < PROPMALE > Potter as I'm stuck in my room doing homework ... This sucks . 
My parents just bought 18 pounds of fish and 20 pounds of steak ... I'm just a little confused . 
It's funny because I've reached the point where I really couldn't care any less about any of this . 
Midnight < PROPMALE > Potter with < PROPFEMALE > (: 
Wants to know why they are playing Miley < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > swift while we're waiting for < PROPMALE > Potter . This displeases me . 
i want to get out of the house and do something ... 
my pandora just went from playing between the buried and me , rise against , bullet for my < PROPFIRST > , children of bodom , parkway drive , etc . to ..... CHRISTMAS MUSIC . i just don't understand . :'( 
I want a donut . 
Tonight's one of those nights where I just can't deal . 
So thankful for my two best friends . Without them I don't think I could have gotten through tonight . 
oh why not . \i'm not gonna lie \"" 
i'm surprised < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > survived thanksgiving dinner with my family . my dad was calling her Trixie , my grandma was calling her < PROPFEMALE > , and i'm pretty sure she had no idea what was going on . 
the kind of people who say \aint\ " are the kind of people i refuse to associate with . you sound like a hick . oh and ex-boyfriends just need to let go . " 
so empty , so used up , so let down , so angry , so ripped off , so stepped on , so filthy , so dirty , so fucked up , so walked on , so painful , so pissed off . pretty much describes me right now . i hate who i've become . i want to go back to the times before highschool . when i still believed in people's honesty . when i could trust people . before i learned that all people do is use other people . when i had self-respect . 
My mom keeps saying I look like a Norwegian sailor . And I learned that my sister was under the impression that my family is Communist ... and tells people that ... 
learned today that i almost pass out when i get blood drawn . how fun . 
i never watched cartoons as a child ... so ... i can't really do this profile picture thing . 
it would be oh so nice if i could just get over the past 
i'm extremely bored and just read through the list of ' safe space ' families . it's funny because there were a fair amount of names on that list that i know for a fact use either drugs or alcohol at home ... 
Since when is pachelbel's cannon a Christmas song ? ( Known as cannon rock or a wedding song to most of you ) 
< PROPFEMALE > Su , < PROPFEMALE > Abdou , and i saw mrs. dillard coming in from her afternoon jog or some such thing . never thought i'd see her in shorts listening to her ipod . 
ants of the sky (: 
Oh I just love having emotional breakdowns in chem 
< PROPMALE > st. < PROPFIRST > is my best friend ever . Literally . Ever . 
we got 9th in the regatta , but overall a fun weekend with the team (: and none of us killed each other either , so that's an accomplishment 
is it weird that i get nightmares from christmas songs ? 
wow . just wow . i guess i can't trust anyone with anything anymore . and no matter what i do the past just keeps coming back to haunt me . 
didn't do awfully on the psat like i thought i would . success (: 
My pants literally fell off during the AP euro mock trial . And I got hit with a chicken leg . 
like this and i'll tell you the first thing that comes to my mind about you 
as i sit on facebook procrastinating on my homework ... i can't help but think of < PROPFEMALE > Klahr's and < PROPFIRST > V Nguyen's speeches today haha 
I love math class with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > ! 
winter concert with North Torrance Youth Musicians Ensemble ( nTyme ) . should be good (: 
intense sailing practice today . one of our boats died , but sailing in the storm was pretty awesome . even though it was chaotic and almost everybody flipped . 
lost all my contacts :/ text my number 310-213-6650 with your name . thanks 
Apologizing doesn't change what happened . 
My mother is obsessed with angry birds . 
Gotta love air mattresses that leak air so that your ass is on the ground while you're trying to sleep -__- 
Just discovered that my grandma snores . And I get to share a room with her for almost a week . Yay . 
I wish the holidays didn't make me so sad 
Read all of catcher in the rye over Christmas < PROPFEMALE > and Christmas day . Actually a pretty decent book . Just not very Christmasy . 
Its hard for me to believe how much things have changed in just a year :/ 
Late night gingerbread house operation and thievery 
i HATE air mattresses . The floor underneath isn't feeling too soft right now . Goodnight all . 
Back in redondo . I want to go do something ! 
So ... Pandora still wont stop playing Christmas music . This frustrates me immensely . 
So out of it today ... Went to the wrong class sixth period and stood there for like 10 minutes trying to figure out what was wrong with the situation . And < PROPMALE > Pezzolo Was watching and laughing the whole time >.< 
Goodnight my fellow lurks- < PROPFIRST > Dooley South , < PROPFIRST > Fortson , < PROPFIRST > Guevara , and Kayley Krok <3 
I don't even know what to say anymore ... 
@ < PROPMALE > St. < PROPFIRST > is my bedtedt friend ever . 
Chips ? 
I am a chip aficianado 
< PROPMALE > St < PROPFIRST > Needs to stop hacking my Facebook every time i go out sailing :p 
Toasty toes with toast !!! And I'm deeply and passionately in love with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > And her toasty toes !!! <3 and I heart her !!! 
Hello my name is < PROPFEMALE > hardy and I look like a confused panda !!! O.o 
< PROPMALE > st. < PROPFIRST > is my bedtedt friend , and I freaking love chips 
Yay for headaches :/ 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > owes me one . 
Pretty great weekend (: 
My sister just asked where i got my bed ... I sleep on a mattress on top of a box spring with no bed frame ... Apparently she wants one like mine ? 
Going to fail the chem test tomorrow . Yay . 
When people try to be tough it makes me laugh (: 
Happy (: 
You < PROPFIRST > like things on form spring now -__- or rather , ' smile ' at them 
Going on a panda hunt 
Yes , < PROPFIRST > Fortson , i am a hobbit . And i quite enjoy it . 
We all know < PROPMALE > st. < PROPFIRST > is my bededt friend 
I love < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > soooooo much !!! More then < PROPFIRST > Gommel because shes my lover !!! 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > just called me a whore face because i beat her at fruit ninja ... O.o 
I got home to find a book on my bed from my dad titled ' Introvert Power ' . To , among other things , help me learn to ' deal effectively with parties , interruptions , and crowds ; bring a slower to tempo into daily life ; claim private space ; and create breaks in conversations and relarionships ' . \ 
... do i really come off as that socially awkward ? -__- 
My dad thought humans breathed out carbon monoxide gas . \ 
\ 
Don't worry though , he's only a college professor . 
Really needed this one day break from everything 
I find it awkward when people poke me who aren't even friends with me on facebook 
like this and I'll answer these about you .. \ 
[] iloveyou . \ 
[] i used to like you\ 
[] i'd date you . \ 
[] you're cute\ 
[] you're weird . \ 
[] you're annoying . \ 
[] i hate you . \ 
[] we've kissed before . \ 
[] needa chill . \ 
[] we needa talk more . \ 
[] i love having you in my life . \ 
[] i dont know you . \ 
[] ex . \ 
[] lets try again\

Tomorrow is going to be awful . 
Snow elves ? 
Would have had to spend my afternoon cleaning up dead and rotting fish , but thankfully I'm under 18 and therefore too young to volunteer (: 
I miss him already <3 
why must the cat want to cuddle NOW of all times . it needs to stop crying outside my doors and understand that i have work to get done -__- 
Apparently I'm a bad enough student that i get yelled for just SHOWING UP , on time , to the ap review session . Yay ... I can't do anything right can i -__- 
An honors bio test , honors chem test , and ap euro quiz all tomorrow ? How wonderful , tomorrow should be absolutely great . 
Raining raining raining . Should be a very wet weekend . 
< PROPMALE > st. < PROPFIRST > is my bededt friend . And I measure french fries in gallons . 
< PROPFIRST > is one cool cat 
So sailing was cancelled today , just < PROPMALE > out in the jacuzzi with < PROPFEMALE > Breen , < PROPMALE > St < PROPFIRST > , < PROPMALE > Svetic , < PROPFIRST > Schiff , < PROPFIRST > , and the cbyc team . After packing up boats in the pouring rain and waiting for an hour in a girls bathroom hiding from the wind . Pretty fun weekend though 
I need to get out . 
It would be so easy (: 
It's that one thought that consumes your mind ... 
I hate this . 
Finally got new glasses (: 
3 golds for ntyme ! String orchestra , band , and chamber orchestra , good job everybody ! 
SWADG .
