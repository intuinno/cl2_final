I feel really bad I missed the Dark Arts Festival this year . Why do all the Festivals have to run at the same time ??? Did anyone snag any photos , video , or other memorabilia ? 

Is off to play in the sand and sagebrush with witches and saints . What a weird combination . 
Just got back from an amazing experience in the mountains with Price pagans and wonderful friends . I feel truly blessed by the Universe right now .

I'd just like to take this opportunity to say how much I love my husband . There , I said it , now I can stop gushing and get to work . 
Put a few sprigs of lavender inside my pillow case last night and slept in ' til 11 ! Lavender really works . Mmmmm , cinnamon coffee and strawberries . I love summer time . 
Watched < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > last night . I know it got poor reviews , but I really liked it , mostly for visual aesthetics alone , but I thought it was really interesting to see how things were run in Versailles before the Revolution . Plus , The soundtrack RawKed 
Is it too early to be excited for Halloween ? 
I have found my next tattoo . Now I just need to gather the funds to get it . My regular artist moved to < PROPFEMALE > . I need to find a new one . Any suggestions ? 
Had a great time at the Farmer's Market yesterday . I met a card reader there who only accepts donations . She was pretty good . Told me some rather interesting stuff about the future ; 0 ) 
Watched < PROPFEMALE > again tonight . Somehow that movie gets better everytime I watch it . Sigh , I came in here under the pretense that I was going to finish my essay for Vause but it's just not happening . Either I'm getting lazy in my collegiate career or ... it's 
I'm taking the $50 I won last night from the Creative Writing contest to buy Placebo tickets since I've been itching to see them for years .

No Placebo any longer . Sigh . They are not coming after all . I am going to go bury my head in the sand and cry . 
I'm going to my dance class tonight . WOOT ! This is the most exciting thing I've done in a very long time . Wretched school schedule ! Strange side-note : I've made friends with several belly dancers on FB and Tribe.net and noticed quite few of them are also graphic designers . I wonder what the correlation is ? 
I'm the Poetry Editor for Metaphor this year ! Oh and the Graphics bitch but I'm used to that by now . Woot ! We're gonna poetically RawK your faces off ! 
Came home to the husband in a trenchcoat . Why is it that trenchcoats always make men just THAT much sexier ? Could be a symptom of early 90s teenagerhood .
