Got through an entire AC/DC cd on the way to work . Thats how long I sat in traffic . Better than work though . =) 
Happy mothers day to the sweetest angel in heaven . =) <3 
Loves it when I find new actors to love , and being able to discover an entire careers worth of entertainment , I.e. < PROPFIRST > Downey Jr. =)

The general public gives me a headache . 
Watched the movie , Chaplin , for the first time and its made me oddly introspective ... 
Vaguely depressed . Its been a looooong day . Ate some ice cream ... getting ready to put in a RD Jr movie to cheer myself up . Oi . O.o 
Would kill to be at the Clapton/Daltry concert . My job really cuts into my social life . 
Why is EVERY air machine in Cincinnati out of order ??? I just want to put air in my tire . Ugh . 
Forgot i had to go to court for work today . Blah . 
Don't think my $6 witness fee check for testifying against shoplifters is going to cover my $35 parking ticket . Our justice system at work . 
So I'm really upset they killed Rorschach in Watchmen . I know , I know . I'm like two years behind and spoiled it for all you other procrastinators . 
Not going to lie ...... the Paranormal Activity alternate ending literally made me cry . ='( 
Happy birthday to my favorite ( now retired ) baseball player < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > ! =) 
God bless 88¢ Banquet meals . I might've starved if not for them . 
Finally leaving work ! And I didn't kill any customers . You guys should be proud of me after a day like this ! =) 
Anyone going to see < PROPFIRST > Frampton in Blue Ash tonight ? 
40 minute delay on < PROPFIRST > reagan ... car caught on fire ... for real I can walk on the highway . Good thing < PROPFIRST > Frampton isn't playing until 8pm . 
Four years ago today I was sitting on the steps of the hotel Ambar in Tuxtla Gutierrez , Chiapas , Mexico with my youth group listening to the faint sounds of a mariachi band playing on the street somewhere ... Good times . =) 
This Red Bull better give me wings 
Should go to bed . Have to be at work at crack o ' < PROPFEMALE > o'clock ... which means I have to be awake even earlier ... but it's so stinking hot ! Ugh . Miserable . 
One hour of work down ... 6 more to go . Its it 1pm yet ? 
The power at my job blew out right after I left ... why can't these things happen when I'm still working ??? 
It's going to be one if those mornings .... =P 
Just surprised my sister by taking her out to see Eclipse . The look on her face ? Priceless . See I can be sweet when I want . =) 
Going to my sister in laws baby shower in east boo foo kentucky lol after that ? Probably nothing because I have no life . 
Why am I still awake ????? smh 
GOT A RAISE !!! CHA-CHING ! =) 
Starving ! IHOP time ! =) 
Ho hum and ( i wish I had ) a bottle of rum ! 
Has A/C !!! Thank you < PROPFEMALE > ! You rock !! =) 
My stupid cat for real woke me up every other hour and now I have to go to work and I feel like doing nothing but sleeping . Ugh . Is it 2pm yet ? 
Oh man you know when you get all slap happy and can't stop laughing ? Yeah that's me right now . Ps < PROPFIRST > Bartlet is am epic movie . I love it . 
100% exhausted . Who wants to go to work for me today ? =P 
Like my status and ill tell you something i like about you , something i dislike , my first impression , and my confession ! :) 
Wow an hour and a half late for work ... good thing i'm the boss ... really need to start getting more sleep . =O 
Money can't buy you happiness but it could sure pay my bills which would lead to peace of mind which would make me happy . Ugh . 
You know those movies where you're rooting for one guy and then halfway through you find out he's the bad guy and all you can say is shit ? Yep . That's whats happening in this movie and it makes me sad . Lol 
Going to be at Coney Island ALL day !!! And happy 25th birthday to my sister < PROPFEMALE > !!! =) 
Noooooooooooooo don't rain ! I haven't rode any rides yet ! 
Had an awesome day at coney . However , you may not recognize me because I have now joined the lobster species . 
Sunburns suck ! This is why I can't go outside without SPF 100 . =P 
If one more person hits me in my sunburn today I might flip out . 
Would take great pleasure in sleeping right now but I have a skit to finish and perform for vbs . It'll be fun if I can stay awake . 
Sometimes it's hard being as awesome as I am . =) 
So if anyone would like to hit the lottery sometime soon , like now , and give me some money it'd be greatly appreciated . 
For my fellow history junkies ... 76 yrs ago today , legendary bank robber < PROPFIRST > Dillinger was murdered by Hoover's G-men outside the Biograph theater in Chicago , betrayed by the \woman in red . \ " Now watch the movie Public Enemies in his honor ! =) " 
I think I'm starting to get sick ... and it sucks ... i for real can't talk . =( 
Why is it still 90° at almost 11pm ??? 
Despicable Me was super epic . 
Super duper bored ... not quite ready for bed yet ... sigh . What to do ? 
Happy 67th birthday to Mick Jagger ! See ya on tour next year ! =) 
Soooooo sleepy . Why does work start so early in the morning ? 
The cat is seriously sleeping on my head . What the heck dude . 
Can't get motivated this morning . Lets just close my store and we can all go to sleep until a more decent hour to open ... like 3pm . =) 
Me and my sister are retarded but we're the most awesome retards ever . =) 
Going to sleep to an I Love < PROPFEMALE > marathon . Best show ever . Classic . <3 <3 <3 
Dear obnoxious guy moving in next door , as if you waking me up wasn't bad enough and blocking my driveway , I must say that if you hit my apt door with anymore boxes our furniture then I will be forced to severely injure you . Sincerely , your caring neighbor in apt #4 
Should be leaving for work right now , but please , ask me if i've moved from this spot yet . =P 
God bless Tropic Thunder and God bless RD Jr. <3 
\Art in the blood is liable to take the strangest forms . \ " - Sir < PROPFIRST > Conan < PROPMALE > " 
Gets to work 13hrs today because Family Dollar is a greedy cotporation and really thinks they can make that much more money being open 3 extra hours . 
This is ridiculous . Is it 930 yet ? Please put me out of my working misery . Ugh . 
Off work today ... how shall I waste my day ??? 
Ugh ! Worst cramps EVER . I'm just going to lay here for like ever . =( 
21 days until I'm 21 ! =) 
Super Duper BORED 
Yes , I know it is 105 degrees outside . Please feel free to stop telling me . 
So . The ENTIRE interior of my car is SOAKING WET from this super random 5 minute down pour of rain that ocurred ... the one time I left my windows down . Just my luck . 
Dear FB Pals , I need you to make me a delicious cheesecake and bring it to Dent , where you'll come in contact with Mr. R . Don't ask how just know it'll happen . You'll deliver the cheesecake to his hands and Mr. R will then bring it through the Narnia passageway and to our covert hideout . Please remember to tip your mythical creature on your way out ! \ 
\ 
Thanks ! < PROPMALE > and Caity \ 
PS : Bonus points for a New York Pizza !

Unloading the truck at work and a giant bottle of bleach leaked all down the front of me . I quit . =P 
Family Dollar : Slowly draining your soul since 1959 ! =) 
Random hail storm was literally blowing my car all over the highway ! Thanks < PROPFEMALE > for wishing such upon me . It did however cool off outside exponentially . 
Has an addiction to RDJr . This is not conducive towards saving money . 
Didn't know I was having dinner with < PROPFEMALE > Minnelli and with Carrot Tops mom but I swear they're at < PROPFEMALE > City Buffet with me . 
Has officially lost my car keys . I cannot even begin to describe how high my blood pressure is right now . 
Still can't find my car keys but thank heaven for spares . Sigh wish i knew where they went . 
A man just came into my store wearing a coconut bra and a skirt . Good bless him for making me laugh so hard .

Doesn't feel like doing anything at work today . Sigh . 
4 more days until I'm on vacation !!!!!! 
A little Putz's ice cream is good for the soul =) 
Is pretty sure The Fowl , aka Dr. Fowler the evil writing dept head at SCPA , put a curse on me in 11th grade . I haven't written anything good since then and it depresses me . The ideas are there they just never make it from pen to paper . 
Dear new School for the Creative and Performing Arts students , enjoy the brand new $73 million dollar school and for the love of < PROPMALE > don't tear it up . You're at the best school in the world , soak it up and have fun !

Has decided to quit my job and become a pirate and search for buried treasure for the rest of my life . Arrrrgh !!!! 
\I have enough tranquilizers in this gun to take down < PROPFIRST > Downey Jr ! \ " - Family Guy episode I just watched LOL " 
Just got my store completely clean 30mins ago and now it's a complete wreck . Can you tell it's the first of the month ? 
Feels immensely satisfied that I have FINALLY updated this story that I haven't posted a new chapter to in 3 years . My readers are going to crap their pants in joy ! =) Perhaps this will also clear up my writer's block ... the guilt of abandoning my readers was clogging up my muse . 
You better check yourself before you wreck yourself . =) 
\Those who dream by day are cognizant of many things that escape those whom dream only at night . \ " --- < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > Poe " 
Guess who has to work through the WEBN fireworks ? This girl ! =( As per usual . Please everyone . Stay away from Family Dollar .

Has helped two different people move on my last two off days . I hope they remember this when I move . =P 
Thinks it'd be nice if I could breathe through my nose again . I hate summer colds . =( 
Is going to need for < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > to stop popping up when I put my mp3 on random . 
Watching Hoarders makes me feel better about my life 
Dear , I-75 drivers ... \ 
Who in the heck ever gave you a license ? Perhaps you should review what it means to merge , how to use a turn single and your mirrors ( in case there is someone already in your desired < PROPFIRST > , like me ) , and the appropriate speed limit for the highway . \ 
When you no longer suck at life you may resume highway travel . Until then , stay home . \ 
Thanks ! 
Is salty the power went out when there was ten minutes left to this movie including the oh so critical moment of does he live or does he die . The fact that I've seen this movie already is irrelevant . 
Two words : WHO DEY ! 
So lets pretend that next Sunday is the first Bengals game of the season =) 
Wants to go to Australia with Oprah and < PROPFIRST > Travolta !!!! 
Watching Sherlock Holmes ! =) 
Oh man . You know that point in life where EVERYTHING is funny ? Yep . I'm there . 
Dear Annoying neighbor across the hall , I hate you . I have since you moved in and made ridiculous amounts of noise with your boxes . I have resisted keying your 09 Charger when you block the driveway . But if you continue to blast your damn bass at such a high decibel I will be forced to ruin your pathetic life . Hell hath no fury like an overworked and sleep deprived woman . That is all . 
I get by with a little help from my friends . <3 
Eating Panera with my bff < PROPFEMALE > =) 
Going to see Devil with < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > and Caity at the Levee =) It's been a great day ! 
watching Sherlock Holmes ... again ... because that's how I roll . =) I'll admit it . I have a problem . <3 God bless < PROPFIRST > Downey Jr. for being so hot . 
Spending time with my beautiful niece , Ms. < PROPFEMALE > ! <3 
Does anybody have the first season of Ally McBeal that they want to let me borrow ? I'm trying to get into that show but I can't find it anywhere but online . =P

Reviving my love for Tropic Thunder <3 
Who dey =) 
Thinks it'd be fantastic if for once while I'm home that these people would be quiet long enough for me to sleep past 7am . This is ridiculous . =( 
How about those Redlegs with that epic walk off homerun ?! First winning season since 2000 , first time winning the division since 1995 . First World Series since 1990 ?! We shall see ! =) 
FYI Something is wrong with my phone sooooo ... the only way to contact me is through FB and my job phone ... hmmm .... BUT that aside I had a super amazing evening hanging out with my favorite band =) 
After a brief nervous breakdown my phone is ALIVE . =) Off work at 1230 ... I love short days . <3 
You know those naps where you are like put in a temporary coma ? Yeah . Those are nice . =) 
My soul died a little when my DM told me to start condensing Halloween so we had even more room for Christmas stuff . 
Out with < PROPFEMALE > at the Main . Might hit a couple other places too . =) 
A little too cold and rainy for haunted houses tonight so LaRosa's and a scary movie with < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > instead =) 
Wishes I got paid $10.50 /hr to roll around on the floor like the other ASM at my store does . I mean really ... she doesn't do her job so what else could she be doing for 8hrs other than rolling on the floor ? 
O'Charleys! =) 
Is slowly falling asleep ... might make it to bed before 230am for the first time in days ! It's been a busy but most excellent weekend . =) 
So much for going to bed at a decent hour . =P 
Crack ' o < PROPFEMALE > o ' clock , why must come so soon ? Working until 1pm . 
Eating the most epic Subway sandwich ever while discussing the attraction between < PROPMALE > and Ms. Piggy and how ridiculous it is . 
needs something to do ... too hyper to sit idly 
Anybody know where to find good two bedroom apartments that are affordable and aren't being over run by crack heads or something terrible like that , that decreases the property value ? lol 
Had like a 30 minute conversation with my cashier today about politics , religion , ethics , world history , trigonometry and literature . I've missed intelligent conversation . =) 
Has been sitting in the car at the Little Caesars parking lot eating pizza for the last hour because I don't feel like going home and dealing with people . Sigh . Exile on main street for real . =P 
Watching < PROPFEMALE > get ready for homecoming .... needless to say the drama is thick in the air ... or maybe that's the hairspray thats enlarging the ozone layer 
So Land of Illusion was epic aside from the fact I ran from the chainsaw dudes and wiped out on the gravel , effectively destroying the right side of my body . But one of the redneck voodoo guys decided to be my boyfriend for the night so that's a plus . lol 
If one word could be used to describe Cincinnati sports it would be this : CHOKE 
Is really sad the power decided to randomly go out on my Iron Man movie marathon night . =( 
Has decided < PROPFEMALE > Downey is the one turning off the power ... it came on and then when I started geeking over RDJ too much it cut back off . Lol 
It's going to be one of those kind of days . Please pray that I don't horribly injure someone . =P 
Just got off work ... have to be right back to work at 5am .... family dollar is honestly trying to kill me .

Had a great kick off to my off day by rocking out with my favorite band all night . The Stones never sounded better =)

< PROPFEMALE > you want me to drive through this storm to go to work ? Um , how about no ? 
Dear Glee , as if I didn't like you enough already ... I'm going to need for you to never ruin an epic musical like the < PROPMALE > Horror Picture Show again . For shame . =P

Can't sleep for crap . Tomorrow is going to be a looooong day . 
Family Dollar is quite literally the devil . And that's putting it in the kindest terms possible . 
#24 , you have been a tremendous influence on my life . You helped me grow in my spiritual walk whether you knew it or not . You're an excellent teacher and youth leader and you know I love you to death . PS : What are we supposed to do now that both of our fav baseball players are retired ??? 
195 it's been awesome to be back in touch again . Missed chatting with you . Super pumped to < PROPFEMALE > out at your going away party . Need to see your DBZ tattoo . Lol

Guess I should wake up now . Smores ice cream and a coca-cola for breakfast ? I think so . =) 
The singer , he looks angry ... at being thrown to the lions . \ 
The bass player he looks nervous ... about the girls outside . \ 
The drummer he's so shattered ... trying to keep in time . \ 
The guitar players look damaged . They've been outcasts all their lives . 
Is going to start charging money when people ask me to do errands for them . =P 
Is so sad my VCR ( yes , those do still exist ) will not rewind St. Elmos Fire so I can watch it . Guess its more of a Pretty in Pink fan . 
Time for work already ??? Definitely a coffee day . 
Some peoples blood pressure drops watching the waves on the ocean ... mine drops in the Chick-Fil-A drive thru . I'm so easy to please . =) 
Today must be \Try and hit < PROPMALE>'s Car Day . \ " I'm going home and not coming back out until people learn how to drive . " 
Does < PROPMALE > Manilow know that you raid his wardrobe ? 
My 4 year old nephew just called me repeating , \Redrum\ " over and over again ... should I be worried ??? lol " 
Hanging out with my BFF < PROPFIRST > ! I missed him so much ! 
At work ... can hardly keep my eyes open . I need to try this thing called sleep every once in awhile . 
Happy 9th birthday to my nephew , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > . Love ya ! <3 
Playing the guitar ... I'm terrible at it but someday I'll be almost mediocre ! =) 
Going out with the best friends to see the < PROPFIRST > Clarke Band @ Allyns Cafe =) 
Got the call my store was robbed for the 3rd time in 6 months . Honestly .... anyone hiring ??? 
I am revoking all those times when I was a kid and said I loved snow . I dont want to drive in this mess . =( 
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl ... Year after year . 
Dear Snow , \ 
After Christmas nobody likes you anymore . Please , have a little dignity and stop trying to shove yourself down everyone's throats . \ 
Thanks , see ya next Christmas . \ 
< PROPMALE > 
Dear Little Old Man who pulled his pants down in the middle of my store , \ 
I hope you're paying for my therapy . It's all downhill from here . \ 
Your traumatized store manager , \ 
< PROPFIRST > Depp is good for my soul . 
Watching the < PROPFIRST > Clarke Band @ Baba Budan's cafe in < PROPMALE > . =)

My co-worker just tried to tell me that < PROPFIRST > Bowie is a country western singer ... WHAT ?! 
Is sleep deprived so I'm taking a long nap . Wake me up and we're going to fight . That is all . =) 
Of all the days for my DM to be at my store , he picks the day it snows and I'm five minutes late . Oi . 
Anything else bad want to happen ? This is stupid . 
Working 730a - 930p and I'm already exhausted . Send me good vibes through out the day . I'm going to need them . 
My co-worker , < PROPFIRST > , said < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > should have stuck to his day job ... WHAT ?! Nothing but blasphemy ever comes from his mouth . 
The lunatic is in my head ... 
Ugh I hate the Steelers so much . The Jets better step it up in the 2nd half . 
Dear stupid kid walking in the middle of the street down Montana hill , \ 
Do not play chicken with me . I have a car . I will win . Also , you have no right to flip me the bird and cuss just because you wore a $200 pair of shoes out in the snow and thought they would stay clean . Invest in some boots . \ 
Thanks from your friendly Ohio driver , \ 
If I was smart I'd be sleeping right now ...

Brianna : I'm getting a snake and it could eat you whole . \ 
Me : Probably , there's not much of me to begin with . \

This has been without a doubt the stupidest day ever .

BECAUSE THE DEAD SOLDIER YOU ARE TRASHING , GAVE HIS/HER LIFE SO YOU WOULD HAVE THE FREEDOM TO EXPRESS YOUR STUPIDITY !

( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 by the Plain White Tees ) 
talking to < PROPFIRST > Dinser via skype 
First day off in over a week and for some reason everybody and their brother thinks its ok to call me at 9am . =P

Where the heck did this snow come from and why is it here ? 
has been on a < PROPMALE > Petty kick recently ... 
Putz's , the most amazing ice cream place in the world is open today . =) 
I visited my nephew's FB < PROPFEMALE > and I've come to the conclusion that not only do kids these days not know how to form a complete sentence , but they also don't know how to speak English period . It's enough to make a spelling teacher jump out a window . 
And now the triumphant return of the Tumbling Dice !!!!!!! 
Tumbling Dice played so AMAZING tonight !!!!! Had a blast !! Can't wait for your next gig !!! 
........... 
I <3 < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Dinser . =) 
Dear Mr. President , I hear you would like to freeze pay rates for soldiers starting next year . Would you also consider cutting your own pay to save more money for our country ? While you're at it , lets cut down all congressman's pay too . If the people who risk their lives don't get an increase in pay , why should we be raising pay for those who take no risks and reap the benefits ? REPOST if you support troops 
Is so ridiculously bored its not even funny 
Thinks if the government doesn't want to pay my fiance for serving our country then they should send him home . 
Darn you < PROPMALE > Sparks ! Your amazing novels have sucked me in again and now its 4am . Don't you know I work at 11 ??? ..... sigh ....... \ 
Okay , just one more chapter . =) 
No matter what kind of a day I've had , he always makes everything so much better . Don't know what I'd do without him . =) I love you , < PROPFIRST > Dinser !!!! <3 
off work for the next two days . Now I won't have to kill anybody . =) 
My Coke ... just tried to kill me ... 
\My heart is yours . It's you that I hold onto . \ " <3 " 
HOLY CRAP THAT THUNDER JUST SCARED THE POOP OUTTA ME !!!!!!!!!!!!! And < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Hadsell pretty much just had a seizure but miraculously did not drop her laptop during her little tap dance . 10 years have been taken off of both of our lives . =O < PROPFIRST > Dinser is a poo poo head for laughing at us ! 
Bracing myself for this monster thunderstorm ='( 
Tornados are not cool .............. think its about time to hide in the basement . 
Sleepless in Cincinnati ... my heart is in Seattle . 
Its a good thing I'm an insomniac or this car alarm that has literally been going off for an hour might have kept me awake . 
Easter musical at church =) 
Have a little priest ... =)

Should've went to bed when he told me to . Ugh . On the plus side Happy easter =) 
What a stupid day . =P

Had to beat some old people down , kick some little kids in the shins , and sell my soul to the lord of gasoline but you better believe I only paid $3.77 for my gas . Let us please forget that my pump didn't shut off and overflowed . \ 
Take that you price gouging jerks . 
Watching season 4 of Ally McBeal w/Robert Downey Jr in it ... really sad that RDJr got fired from the show ... I LOVE his character with Ally . This is so disappointing . lol
