Officially removed my labret piercing , and successfully replaced it with a naval . ;3 May be masochistic , but I enjoyed it !! 
I love how a really good thing happens , and you can remember waking up that morning with no idea that the day will turn out as good as it did , lol . BUT it totally sucks when it turns out to be a bad day . :/ 
I WILL have a nice weekend . :3 I may even wear the dress Aunt < PROPFEMALE > got me for Easter ... ^^ <3

Ahahaa ,,, why do I ever go anywhere else ? The party's HERE , yo . 
I'm < PROPFEMALE > and i left my computer unattended :D 
Finally got my laptob back to use for something other than homework .. but I don't really wanna look at it anymore .. it makes me sick . u_u lol 
I can't believe no one has done a study to find out why some people don't get high the first time smoking pot .. :/ I really thought there was a logical reason , but I can't find anything >:( 
Okay , so I tagged you NorCal people in the Easter photos .. It bugs me sometimes to be tagged , so tell me if there's a pic there you don't want :3 <3 u guys !

Wow , I have 1 1/2 month to finish 8 classes . Time to get down to business . >:3 
So . I had to go on campus today to take my RPA test , and was nervous as hell . I logged in and out of the test in under 7minutes , reading at 157wpm , and only got 2 questions wrong on all 3 sections on the test . Hell freakin yea ! 
Insomnia . Where IS somnia , exactly ? ' Cuz I'd like to be there about now . -_- 
just realized- I really don't ever do anything to get people to approve of me . It sounds like a good thing .. until you realize how many people DON'T . lmfao !! 
this site is getting more and more boring . How is it that I used to be able to keep myself entertained on facebook , < PROPFEMALE > ' till dusk ? 
Novels aren't meant to be read in 3 hours ... my head is throbbing . -__- 
* shoots self * 
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep ... lalalaa .. * musical note * ;D 
How does an hour-long shower relax you EVERY TIME ? I love it . <3 
Oops . Relapse . Well- I didn't shoot myself at least . T_T

About Mother's Day Plans : < PROPFEMALE > says to have everybody who will be there to RSVP to her if you haven't already ... Aunt < PROPFEMALE>'s buying cold-cuts , and doesn't know how much to buy since they aren't gonna buy extra \just-in-cases\ " lol . < PROPFEMALE>'s cute when she rants . x3 " 
Now , everybody blamed his old man , for making him mean as a snake- when < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > was a boy , his daddy would use him for alligator bait . x-) 
I didn't get my friend-of-the-day today ! How sad .. no friends . xD 
It feels like my life has been on pause since I turned 11 , and I have just watched myself do things , and seen things happening .. Once I was offered a home in Covina again- someone pressed play . So . Here we go .. :) 
Just got home from < PROPFEMALE>'s . It was nice- not so chaotic like the usual x3 Wish I was there long enough to see < PROPMALE > & < PROPFEMALE > though :/ 
No . You cannot bring them .. can't we ever just < PROPFEMALE > out one-on-one like we USED to ? Did I get boring all of a sudden ?? wth . ... I wanna be important too ... ]; 
Helping a lesbian score a chick is WAY more fun than helping a dude get laid . Ily , < PROPFEMALE > ! <3 <3

10-page report , only rule : HAS to be a subject touched at some point during my 11th grade year . \ 
Subject of choice : d-lysergic acid diethylamide ( only mentioned in my text 2x , once not even a full sentence , but they have to count it ) . :D \ 
Can you believe I will qualify for psychadelic therapy studies at research programs like MAPS , for crucial anxiety disorders in a year and a half ? lol 
Mini's First Time was AWESOME . For not getting very many props , it had a good story line . Very ... familiar . xD <3 
Off to type my report . Shall I post a copy of the finished result ? I bet you didn't know how interesting acid REALLY was ! x//D 
OMFG . Go to google , and hover over the pacman ' Google ' sign .. YOU CAN PLAY . This is the coolest thing that's happened to me all week . x ]

I couldn't think of a funny way to share with you the information of my delicious breakfast on the go . Odwalla strawberry smoothie , Mocha-walla bar & some avacado . And now that I read this over , the info wasn't that interesting in the first place .. very difficult to spiff up . =/ 
Is there a problem occifer ? 
MADE IT ONLINE . I got the feeling this connection won't last very long .. since piggybackings illegal , but .. yeah . So . Seeing < PROPFEMALE > has been a short adventure this lovely weekend !! I've learned many life lessons ... x3 
< PROPFEMALE > says Dimmu Borgir ( after listening to them ) and < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > shouldn't exist on the same iPod . Then asked me what exactly iPods are . LOL .

Just finished making the most disgusting breadsticks ever . Mm mm . But , my choice was that or Menudo .. blech . I'm beginning to think my dad should stop spending his moneh on kitchen appliances .. and buy some FOOD , yo . I'm hungry . AND five pounds lighter . >:/ lol 
No moar < PROPFEMALE > , thanks for coming up and hanging out !... and no moar Victorville . I can't believe I'm actually leaving . I've been dreaming about this week for 6 years !! ( So why the heck am I scared ? ) :s

Oh .. my god . Who else knew that \Dammit I'm Mad\ " backwards is \ " Dammit I'm Mad\ " ?!?! Huh . I TOTALLY got a cheap thrill off the realization . <3 " 
Morning < PROPFEMALE > is my lurrrrve . <3

It's amazing to sit on the couch without being poked to death . C : 
@The Corner Bakery with Hailehhh . <3 It just so happens to be the location of my new favorite coffee drink , and wireless hotspot ... today was pretty freakin ' fun . :D 
Stood outside in the pouring rain .. 
Annnnnd , my laptop has a virus . A freaking BIG one . I guess that's what happens when you bittorrent hundereds of movies .. but still . I've never NOT been able to re-program my comp before ~ this . is . war .. ]:< 
Alright so . 2 Tickets for Ozzfest this year will be a little over $320 . Who's driving me for a possibly free way in , huh ? - < PROPFEMALE > can't drive ...

\You\

Couldn't & didn't sleep . But , staying up to have a cup of coffee at 4 a.m. with an old woman has proven to be quite entertaining . <3 
Hookt on foniks dun goood fer me . 
Raging waters yesterday and frozen waffles this morning . It has been a good two days <3 I feel like I'm six again . n_n 
Effffff your definition of love . Not just you , but the other person as well . And , not just the two of you .. that one dude over there too . -_-' 
Okay , yeah . Inception was killer . One of the very rare movies I've seen and been truly envious of the imagination of the writers . (: 
.. Gave in . I have a Twitter now . 
' s dad came by unexpectedly . Then we walked to lunch and gossiped . x3 Let's hope hanging out with the old man is this much fun in 30 years . <3 
Out to dinner tonight with the ol ' gals . >.< They asked me for some ideas ... and ruled out Hooters before I opened my mouth . -_- Any suggestions ? 
just realized yesterday that I haven't had severe acne anymore , after looking at the past year or so of pictures of me . ( lol ) Then proceeded to make fun of the new Zeno Hot Spot commercial , \I mean 
My tongue got in the way of my eye-teeth , and I couldn't see what I was saying ... It was intoxigasmic . 
.. Four more days until my beautiful event , aka : Ozzfest2010 , must be passed up . Four more days until I have permanently salvaged $253+ for myself . Saving money , just ... sucks ? <3 
Okay , so the parental units have gambled away my only home ( bye < PROPFEMALE > ) .. and I'm gonna be living .. oh wait , they don't care . Honestly , wtf is the point of meddling in someone's life to strictly make it worse ?? 
Just found out that our first lady and daughter just got back from Spain . Now the big P and his fambam are going to < PROPFEMALE>'s Vineyard for a vacation . Now .. I don't know the details , but I'm sure there are a lot of people around here that haven't had a nice vacation in a while . XD Not . cool , man . Not cool . 
\You don't have to die to be in a better place 
< PROPFIRST > Pilgrim was so AMAZING -.- I've never seen < PROPFIRST > Cera be such a badass . <3 And the twins ? Yea , they were hella sexy . C :

Hmm .. how all of my accounts seem to have connected themselves to my facebook ... -___-

GOT my meds .. And now , to catch up on 5 days worth of schoolwork . This should be much easier than yesterday . :D

Someone should text me around 8 in the morning tomorrow .. and make me do my homework instead of sleeping in . ^3^ 
Finished Speed Racer at 12:00 , then spent the first hour of today cutting layers into my own hair- with instructions I found on Google . Oh yea , I'm baaaaaad .. \

I wonder how safe I am to actually post my honest thoughts .. because it's totally probable that I'm about 10min away from pissing my brother off beyond belief . <3 Love you < PROPMALE > , lol ! 
Joke of the day : Why does it take EXACTLY 13 PMSing girls to screw in a light bulb ? 
I'm gonna be someone who will make < PROPFEMALE > Walls proud . Just watch and see . She's going to congratulate me someday- as I will her . :]

Whoa ... so anthropology is a social science ?? Then wtf is is called when you chop dead people up for a living ?

F * the Kardashians , and the ' actual ' circumference of their asses . -___- 
Cousins are there as childhood friends and are there when we are older as forever friends . No one will ever understand your crazy family like your cousins ! Repost if you have cousins that make you smile ! :) . { Mine are crazy-awesome . Even the ones I don't < PROPFEMALE > with all the time . <3 } 
A warning to those dieting- DON'T . You just might actually lose some weight . And your clothes JUST MIGHT not fit at ALL anymore . And you may be pretty broke , and have to wear ugly rags until you're not broke anymore ... D; 
Valentines ? c :\ 
I should have prepared for this better . 
* Checks calender*\

May the Flying Spaghetti Monster bless the day I'm < PROPMALE > enough to clothe and shelter my new-found self . 0 :) 
AHHH . Really , with my reputation in getting along with people , why am I always the venting-outlet ? I don't want to hear about your PROBLEMS !! D: 
Baby-sitting the most adorable puppy ever is so much fun ! He seems to think I'm strange though , playing around the backyard with him . x3 
Why did no one inform me that Wuthering Heights isn't a crappy story ? I actually find this plot quite interesting ... and original ( but that might be because it was written a billion years ago :/ ) . 
Uhm . My baby nephew just passed out on my lap after a big yawn and a coo . ^^ 
These four walls speak such a fluent consistency .. when shall it change ? ... Or when will I learn to speak it myself , and then become content ? 
I've never before been so proud of my lil ' < PROPMALE > . I started singing a South Korean boy-band song , the english verse .. and guess who finished it off in Korean ?? :DDD The brain washing is complete . ^^ 
I've never been so homesick before now , I want to go back , with everything I am ... But I don't even have a home to be missing . :/ Suuuu does that just make me sick ? x ) 
< PROPFIRST > Sheen passed the live drug test !! Whoo-hoo ! lol 
I hope < PROPFIRST > draws my picture sometime soon .... * sigh * I'm horrible at being patient >.< 
Matty took us out for sushi !! And it wasn't just not horrible- it was really gewwwwd ... o__o . And I gotta say , the miso kinda butted out just about any other kind of soup out there . <3 
Why did I ever leave the comfort of my gramma's ? Why did I ever complain about her freakish-over controlling , nosy ways ? I miss having someone actually give a sh*t , even if it was [ way , way ] too much . 
I am now 2 hours away from having red liquorice-colored hair ... >:) 
My messages STILL won't load . wtf ?!? 
.. I want Taco < PROPFEMALE > .. :3 
If I EVER decide to have a child- someone remind me of the diaper changing < PROPFIRST > and I just experienced . It was the most chaotic event I've ever witnessed . Good thing he's DAMN cute ... -_- ( Even with baby powder caked on his ear , and his diaper backward D: ) 
.. Boy . Here's St. < PROPFEMALE>'s day all green and happy , and such . And I'm sitting home today .. Not even drunk . This is a first in QUITE a while . TTxTT\ 
LOL !!

At least she was nice and loaded when I got to hear her voice . <3 If anyone gets any news , please let me know ?? ( At least until I am down there ) My mom and I don't communicate as often as it may seem , and I don't have a phone . 
I hope there are some good Japanese restaurants in SoCal ...

You know that urge you have to get up in someone's face and go \Ha ! That's what you get for being dumb . \ " ? ~ I love that urge . " 
Well ... my laptop crashed for sure this time . It's dead . And there goes me finishing high school as a senior , let alone starting college . Wow ... I think everything just disappeared under me . :\\ 
SO I might have a temporary solution to my laptop ... the ground beneath my feet has reappeared ..? At least slightly . <3 
Got my birth certificate & SSC . Filed for a California ID . Filed my fafsa . Accepted to Citrus . (!!!!!!!!!!!) :DD \
