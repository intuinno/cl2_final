Why is it that men have to be such nasty hateful people ? They ask you to check on something for them ..... you do it .... and give the information to them word for word as you are viewing it on the computer screen .... and they won't believe what you are telling them .!!!!! I just don't understand it ! 
Woke up with a fierce headache this morning . Darn allergies . Hopefully Zyrtec will help . Soooo much to do today ......... 
Need to find a home for a 7yr old male Tuxedo Cat . Front paws declawed and neutered . Preferably a home with older children or to an retired couple . 
Cienna has gone to the Fair . Dinner and dishes done . Doing laundry . Showered and Pj's on and getting ready to play cards with my Mother AGAIN !!!!! Oh well I've prolonged it all day . I'm just not into it though . I want to be at the Fair too . 
Just got Mom to bed and it's 2:25 A.M. on Sunday morning . She said she wasn't tired , but I told her IIIII AMMMM . I played cards with her , Baked her homemade oatmeal cookies , did dishes again all while I worked on laundry . Cienna got home @ 11:30 from the fair . Played cards with Mom again . Tucked CC into bed Just tucked Mom in and I don't have anybody to tuck me in . I think I'll cry . LOL . 
Children with special needs don't have an illness , so there is no cure and it isn't contagious . They want what we all want , to be accepted . Most of you probably won't copy and paste this . Could you do it and leave it on your status for at least 1 hour ? It's Special Education Week .? 
Cienna and < PROPFEMALE > are playing school in her room after a dinner of fried potatoes , sausage links and biscuits . Dishes , laundry , and settle back for a little while to watch a movie . Hope to go to the pool tomorrow for some late summer sunshine !? 
Quote of the day ! Money can't buy friends , but it can get you a better class of enemy .? 
Just started a temporary work project and havn't had a sinus infection this year until this weekend . This stinks . The group of Engineers I work with asked how my weekend was when they came in today . I responded by saying that it wasn't too bad except I caught a bug somewhere . They said oh yeah we've all been passing it around the last couple of weeks . Gee thanks guys !? 
At the library on line . 
Voted , Had lunch with Cienna , and at the library . Desperately need to clean and do laundry ! 
CONGRATULATIONS SHERIFF < PROPFIRST > LAYTON !!!!!! SO HAPPY FOR YOU !!!!!! 
I have carried a baby in my body . I have comforted a baby on my chest . I have kissed boo boos , been puked , pooped & peed on . Woke up to a hungry baby and stayed up all night with a sick baby . But I wouldn't have it any other way . My body isn't magazine perfect , but when I look ... in the mirror ...... I see a Mom , and the ... re is no greater honor or blessing . Make this your status if you are proud to be a MOM ! 
Just logged onto my Coke rewards account planning to trade them in on a gift for someone and it said I have a zero balance . There is no way that could be . I spent about 1000 points last summer but I had alot more than that left in my account . I am very upset because I feel as someone has stolen them from me ! Makes me angry .? 
Wishes heaven had a phone so I could talk to you again . I thought of you today , but that is nothing new . I thought about you yesterday , and days before that too . I think of you in silence . I often speak your name . All I have are memories and a picture in a frame ... Re-post this if you have someone in heaven that you miss and love ? 
Home with my Mom and Cienna . Doing laundry and playing cards with Mom . Sure wish she would go to bed . Have to get up really early , need to wash her hair and curl it for staters . The rest will fall in place . I hope ! 
Happy Thanksgiving to all of my friends and family . Hope you had a great day !? 
Going back to bed . Couldn\t sleep . Hot soaking bath and ready to go . Work on Christmas decorating tomorrow . How ironic .... don't have a job so I have plenty of time to decorate ... however not enough funds to give gifts like how really would like to ... hummmm ? Oh well the lights will brighten things up anyhow ......? " 
Change your fb profile picture to a cartoon from your childhood . The goal ? To not see a human face on fb till Monday , December 6 . Join the fight against child abuse ; copy & paste this to your status to invite your friends to do the same .? 
don't need an Angel on my Christmas tree , I already have an Angel in heaven looking down on me :) Put this as your status if there is someone in heaven you will miss this Christmas ? 
It takes 7 seconds for food to pass from mouth to stomach . A human hair can hold 3kg . The length of a penis is 3 times the length of the thumb . The femur is as hard as concrete . A woman's heart beats faster then a man's . Women blink 2x as much as men . We use 300 muscles just to keep our balance when we stand . The woman has read this entire text . The man is still looking at his thumb . Repost if this made you smile . 
Watching a movie and eating a brownie with walnuts and sugar free chocolate icing . Yum . chasing it with a diet coke .

Copy & paste this if your Dad is in heaven : If roses grow in heaven , Lord , then pick a bunch for me . Place them in my Daddy's arms , and tell him they're from me . Tell him that I love and miss him , and when he turns to smile , place a kiss upon his cheek and hold him for a while . I love you and miss you ....

If you're a police officer , significant other of a police officer or just a friend of a police officer , please repost these stats . Since < PROPFIRST > 1 , 2011 , 53 officers have been shot at , 37 were hit , 14 of those within a 36 hour period , 10 have died & 2 remain in critical condition . To my brothers & sisters on that thin blue line . Stay alert , stay vigilant , stay strong , and GO HOME . 
A woman is like a tea bag - you can't tell how strong she is until you put her in hot water . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > 
Giving up doesn't always mean you are weak . Sometimes it means that you are strong enough to let go . 
Thumping headache today . Back to bed . Hope it's gone by tomorrow . [: -~) ] 
ASKING if everyone could please put this as their status for one hour . Think of someone you know or love who has had cancer . My prayer is that in 2011 a cure \ 
will be found . Will you post it ? Just one hour . Too many to mention have fought and are fighting it . I hope to see this in the status of all of my friends . ? I love you 
Thinking of my brother < PROPFIRST > . He would have been 60yrs old on the 21st . It's hard to believe he has been gone since April 1998 . Miss you and think about you always ....... 
An old man once said ... There comes a time in life , when you walk away from all the drama and people who create it . You surround yourself with people who make you laugh , forget the bad , and focus on the good . So love the people who treat you right , pray for the ones who don't . Life is too short to be anything but happy . Falling down is a part of life , getting back up is living . ~ Re-post if you agree .. 
\The easiest thing to BE in the world is YOU . The most difficult thing to be is what other people WANT you to be . Don't let them put you in that position . \ " — < PROPFIRST > Buscaglia .. "

has a very personal reason for asking if everyone can put this as their status for one hour . I know the ones that will . Think of the ones you know or love who have had cancer . My wish for 2011 is that a cure will be found . Will you post this for 1 hour ? Do it for all and please do it for me ! There are too many to mention who have fought or are fighting-I hope to see this in the status of all my friends and family ! 
Well orientation was today at 9:00 .... So just like so many of my best made plans I get a call at 8:00 saying it won't be until noon . Story of my life ... Can't plan for anything .... just call me FRUSTRATED ........... [ : -q ] 
DEADLY TERMS USED BY WOMEN : 1 . FINE-This is the word women use to end an argument when they KNOW they are right and you need to shut up . 2 . NOTHING-This means SOMETHING and you should be wary . 3 . GO AHEAD-This is a dare , NOT permission . DON'T DO IT ! 4 . WHATEVER-is a woman's way of saying F*YOU ! 5 . THAT'S OK-She's thinking long and hard before deciding HOW and WHEN you WILL pay for your mistake ! Repost .! 
Back to bed . Woke up about 1:00 and couldn't go back to sleep . Too many things on my mind . [(: |] I am officially ready now . Amen 
29 yrs ago today I gave birth to a beautiful baby boy . Best day of my life . Love you < PROPFIRST > and I hope you have a great Happy Birthday ! Love from your Momma !!!! 
Happy to have a job and being involved in the launch of a new product but so dreading the next month . Mandatory 12 hr days 7 days a week unless otherwise notified . Oh I so wish the girls trip to the beach was May instead of April .
