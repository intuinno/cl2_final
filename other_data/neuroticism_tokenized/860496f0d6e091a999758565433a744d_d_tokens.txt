cell phone stollen ...... very unhappy 
yepp it should be against the law to make someone work at 4:30 in the AM ..... especially when they close the night before . thank you coffee for the crutch 
Since when did Sprint only hire people in 3rd World Countries to answer customer service and sales calls ? Oh and did i mention they work from home . So as pleasant as it is to argue with them about a phone , you also get the added bonus of hearing their children in the background . Good job Sprint .

Got my new phone !! Finally . 3 weeks phoneless is not cooL
