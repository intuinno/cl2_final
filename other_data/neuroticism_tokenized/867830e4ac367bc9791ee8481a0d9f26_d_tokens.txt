Still wide awake . I'm sure once I start doing something productive , like homework , I'll be dead tired . D: 
wishes school would just stop . Just ... take a long , long break . Or only skip to the fun days . :]] 
Crap . One of the worse feelings in the world : having fun all weekend , getting nothing accomplished , thinking about how much sleep you're going to get tonight ... then remember at the end you had homework due 1st period tomorrow . Mother ... 
soccer game was awesome . Congrats varsity and < PROPFEMALE > ! =] 
Feet ache , knees numb ... standing for long periods of time isn't fun . =P At least it's SPRING BREAK !!!! :DDD 
Happy Pi Day ! :] 
Dude , just put on a hoodie I haven't worn in a while ... found my starbucks card I thought I lost and $20 . Freakin ' . Awesome . :D 
I mean ... really , Texas ?? 
Is still awake . Lots of random stuff on my mind , and pages of homework still left undone ... 
is procrastinating ... yet again . 
Man , I've resorted to looking of pictures of someone I haven't seen in years ... and then looking through pictures of someone tagged that I also have not seen and wondered \ ... How the hell do these two know each other ??? \ " Probably should give up the homework and go to bed ... " 
getting up at 5:30 am is not good . >_< having work and going to bed at 11:30 the night before isn't good either . 
love hanging out with my best frands . =] Excited for tonight ! 
Worse feeling = thinking you look great , then realizing later from someone else you look disgusting ... 
anyone know how to export a freakin scrolling banner so that you can use it in dream weaver ? =\\

Had a great performance at UIL . Got 1-2-2's in both concert and sightreading , not bad at all . =] SOOO glad tomorrow's friday . Bring on the weekend ! 
Had a pretty kick ass weekend , if I do say so myself . =] Lots done , time was spent with church , best frands and family . I'm now attempting to psych myself up for this week . Where's TAKS when you need it ?? 
It sucks when you can't go to sleep ... worse when you know you have to get up at 7 the next morning . D: 
Bus leaves in 7 hours . Yay . At least we're missing school . :D 
can't we just have one more day of weekend ?? Please ?? 
I bet it would be nice to have summers after you're done with school and doing other jobs . 
Y'know , it's amazing how utterly and amazingly retarded and lame some people are . 
Never fall asleep while watching Avatar . Had some freaky dreams . o_O 
life is pretty freakin awesome right now . :] 
can't sleep . D: I swear I'm turning into an insomiac . And this time I didn't drink any coffee or a monster , honest ! 
Actually enjoyed choir rehersal tonight . :o Perhaps because I haven't sang in 2 weeks due to TAKS and AP testing , but I'm really excited for our concert tomorrow at < PROPMALE > at 7:00 . :] It's a tribute to < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . 
Oh , graduation , why must you be so close , yet very , very , veerrrrrry far away ?? D: 
Prompromprompromprompromprom . :]] 
so sad the dj is lame . hopefully afterprom is awesome . :D 
after finally finishing my website ( late ) for mr. thompson , i think I am offically done with school work for high school . :] 
Some people are WAY too full of themselves . Don't act like your better than someone when you haven't even had a full conversation with them . Don't decide your problems are bigger than everyone else's halfway through their sentence . Just , stop . The world will come crashing down on you soon enough . 
Just finished making Tres Leches cake for choir tomorrow . =] Looks really good , better than last year for spanish . lol . 
It doesn't feel like summer . At all . The past few days : yes . Now ? I dunno . 
Choir people : Anyone have pictures from concerts , class or anything ? Trying to have a photo album of high school and realize I have no pictures whatsoever ! I know my Jazz people should have some . =] 
Yay , biking , then breakfast , then board games , then swimming . Loving today . :] And no work ! =D 
Come on , orientation ! Come on , paychecks ! Come on , moving out ! ... But thank God it's summer . =] 
Could really really really really use a full back massage . 
So on my way home , I see this flashing light about 8 feet off the ground and long legs moving underneath it . I'm freaking out in my car , thinking Bigfoot has finally attacked < PROPMALE > , when in fact turns out it was a guy wearing a light on his head , riding a horse at midnight down my street ! I don't even know where one would keep a horse in my neighborhood . o_O 
been off of soda for 5 days , somehow no caffeine withdrawl symptoms , wierd considering I haven't been drinking tea or coffee or anything . o_O Hope the worst is not yet to come ... 
retail therapy = very good thing . :) 
Does anyone know of any scholarships I can still apply for this late ? 
God , sometimes I wish we could move into dorms a few weeks early ... just to get away from annoying family . =P 
Some people are probably never going to outgrow high school . :\\ 
Cleaning one's room is not much fun . :\\ 
As I read The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo , I can't help but think of Wuthering Heights as well . D: 
At the Wisconsin State Fair , they've introduced the Krispy Kreme Cheeseburger : a beef < PROPFEMALE > with two slices of cheese ... between 2 Krispy Kreme doughnuts . Gross . :) Then again , we have fried coke and fried twinkies . =P 
No more Sonic ! Now it's time to finally attempt packing ... 
Wednesday needs to hurry up and come on !!! 
Hangers are stupid when trying to pack them . Always getting tangled up in themselves , taking up so much more room than they need to . D: Packing is almost done , though ! 
Finally finished up unpacking my stuff in my dorm . Too bad we're all leaving tomorrow morning to an off-campus retreat/camp thing for 3 days ... Pony up ! :] 
Rockin ' the 9am class today . Just a warm-up for my 8am tomorrow I guess . Happy First Day everyone ! :D 
the weather is PERFECT !!! 
glad she had a really great time tonight with her small group . much more than i was expecting . btw , we owned at janga . :) 
College choir - thousands of times better than high school . No duh . Boulevarding at SMU - thousands of times better than any other college tailgating . Again , no duh . =] I'm excited for tomorrow . SMU dat's waz up ! 
I hate english papers . Especically when they're due in less than 24 hours . Wonder how well this will go . >_< 
Life/desk/work is slowly getting organized . Hopefully this will make the rest of this week bareable ( this is if I can get all the stuff due tomorrow completed tonight after engineering meeting/One28 . :P ) 
Haha , both my high school and my college are playing their rivals tonight . Good luck < PROPMALE > ! And FRY THE FROGS SMU ! TOUCHDOWN MUSTANGS ! :D 
Is really relieved to hear everyone is OK . God bless those down at UT . 
I like it on the floor , right inside the front door . :) 
I'm excited about Straight No Chaser coming tonight . :) 
Unfortunantly just lost the game for the first time in months . Sorry guys . ;P 
Why does it sound like everyone is having drama right now ? Lord have mercy ... 
Praying for those at A&M . God , first UT , now this ?? 
How is it already friday ? :)) 
Of course , my highlight of the night was not singing at the concert , but afterwards hearing two people singing < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > ; I joined in and we harmonized . Love college/choir . =] 
The pressure makes us stronger ; the struggle makes us hunger . The hard lessons make the difference , and the difference makes it worth it . 
Lets see if these 18 years of procrastinating have paid off ... 6-8 < PROPFEMALE > report due Wednesday , haven't started . Challenge accepted . 
Went beast-mode on my chemistry final . =] 1 down , 4 more to go ! 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas !!!!! 
And to think I was wearing shorts yesterday ... 
Extractions are painful . x_o Thank goodness for painkillers ! 
Thanks everyone for the happy b-days !!! 
PICNIC !!! :) 
To set or not to set my alarm tomorrow ... have an 8am , get an email by 6am if school is closed ... but dang , will half the kids be here regardless ? 
All DFW school districts and colleges are cancelled tomorrow ... except SMU . All of the sidewalks and roads are literally covered with at least an inch of solid ice ... why ? 
Going to the grocery store after 5 days of ice on super bowl weekend ? Mission accepted .
