Let sleep take me into its loving grasp\ 
shift my world as if through a looking glass\ 
I shall sleep in peace with eyes held closed as a clasp\ 
until I wake and let my dreams pass 
I awake with loud noise and shunshine rays\ 
adrenalin pumps then calms as reality breaks away from dream\ 
distressed thoughts of what needs to be done in so many ways\ 
play some music to calm the mind and blow off some steam . 
wants more skype friends . doogles . mycloud is me . 
I was going to write another poem for me going to sleep , but I'm too tired to make one again . Guess yesterday was poem day . 
Frente ! is my new favorite band . 
When ever I heard people talk about their heart hurting from emotional stress or something , I used to think that it was just something that I didn't expierence , this is because when ever I heard it ..... 
I need someone to talk to . 
LARP Is rather fun once you get past how geeky it is , and take out the \I CAST FIRE BALL\ " crap . Its also an amazing work out . " 
If\ 
you know me , you know that I am ________ , I love_________ , and I \ 
can't stand_________\ . Post this to your wall and see what others think !!! " 
anyone ever listen to songs that remind you of people you used to like and it just didn't work out and that song fit that exact time , so the song reminds you of a depressing time in your life , or is that just me .

I Cut my her , not all of it just sides and back , going fo-hawk , wish I would have gone mowhawk 
some people make me want to break things . Good think I have very good self control 
Times change and the tides turn\ 
We all work hard and try to learn\ 
When we have opposition in our path\ 
We fight to overcome and are slow to wrath 
Has anyone ever been to the point where you just don't want to start a conversation but you want to talk to someone ? 
Don't you hate it when people turn out to be less than you wanted them to be , or that you thought they were ?

Confusion is something more pure than anyone realizes , in my opinion , Confusion is a conflict between what your mind wants and what your heart wants . or what your mind believes and what your heart believes . you can tell which side is winning too , its really rather simple ... 1/2

I am way to bored to quit smoking .... this sucks .... brain words no function correct with word from mouth . RAW RAW RAW RABBLE RABBLE ! 
I find classical music ... Very refreshing . You see , for some strange reason , when I listen to Classical , I feel more intellectual . With this , my vocabulary seems to increase , but my spelling still remains horrid . anyone care to ponder on why that is with me ? 
Why is it I'm always on FB but I never get attention on FB ? Does everyone just not like me and I'm completely oblivious . 
How do you make a like < PROPFEMALE > thing ? 
I'm only off of passing my PT test for end of basic for the running part by .... 6 < PROPFEMALE > 30sec .... and I'm pretty far off for my pushups and situps . my goal before I leave on < PROPFIRST > . 04 , 14 < PROPFEMALE > 2 mile , 60 situps in 2 < PROPFEMALE > , and 50 pushups in 2 < PROPFEMALE > .

I'm going to die before I even get shipped out -,-

99%\

skyscraper about to jump . If you are the 1% sitting there with popcorn \ 
& 3D glasses , screaming \DO A BACKFLIP ! \ " 
I want more skype friends =/ 
I just got pocket dialed by the number ( 208 ) 697-6790 . anyone know who that is ? 
Have you ever had that feeling where you're happy for someone because they're happy , but you have total conflicting feelings because they have something you've always wanted but know deep down its near impossible to achieve in your current state ? 
I've been having strange urges to delete everything that connects me to the internet , like , facebook for starters , but , its actually the last of 2 browser based things I'm still holding on to . don't know why , anyone wanna help me figure it out ? 
Is thinking back on his past . The people he once knew , the thoughts about them and realizing that they weren't true . Never really a fun thing . 
Facebook is like hypnotoad on futurama . for me atleast . Stair at a pointless screen that doesn't change for hours , untill a comercial that is . 
is it sad that I just now realized why not many people liked me in HS ?.... or really in general . I'm the creepy awkward kid that makes the stupidest comments in hopes to be funny but rarely gets the laughs . 
I just had a thought ... ( oh no another < PROPMALE > thought ) . You know how people always blame guys for acting different to their GFs around theirh friends , well , has anyone ever stopped to think about how girls act different around their friends ? I've had GFs that do that and it makes me angry that they do , because they became people I didn't even want to be with at all .... 
How he loves\ 
< PROPFIRST > Crowder Band\ 
nuff said . 
anime named Gantz , very bloody , very sexual , and extremely confusing ending . don't watch it .

Starship Troopers marathon ! half way through movie one .... of three 
I forgot how much I liked Chiodos :P 
I wanna know why I can't find that one thing I'm better at than anyone I meet , or something that I can feel like I actually stand a < PROPMALE > at against other people that have been doing it for a while . maybe I never will find it ... =/ maybe its killing people , who knows , I wont find that out untill I'm in Afgan . 
Daybreakers , not that bad of a movie , I just wish the ending was a bit cooler . 
I just realized today that after I get out of the army , I'm not going to be able to live alone , no matter how much I try to tell myself I like to be alone , its not true . one full day with no human interaction and I feel crazy , like not the normal crazy I am ... 
I just had the best game of League of Legends in my LIFE ! Ended 21/9 , after I got my blood thirster , I stopped dieing , so the 9 deaths were start game , and the kills were mainly endgame XD 
today is gunna suck ... monkey nuts ... hardcore ... -Sigh- 
I just had the realization that I probably won't ever find the right girl for me because I look for someone who is constantly distant in emotional attachment . and that can't really happen in a healthy relationship . so now I need to find a way to change my way of thinking on that .... yay 
Drag me to Hell has a better ending than The Mist . and I didn't think that was possible ROFL ROFL ROFL ! 
I wanna make Duck tape shoes .... I just need to get duck tape and some material to use for the souls 
I need friends to < PROPFEMALE > out with before I leave in January , TEXT ME ! or I might forget why I'm going in the army to protect this land ! lol , jk about that last part , but really , text me . 
What means this heaviness that hangs upon me ? This lethargy that creeps \ 
through all my senses ? Nature , oppress'd and harrass'd out with care , \ 
Sinks down to rest . \

I need a new AC/DC Adapter for my laptop . DA90PE1-00 . That model number is the adapter I need :( 
all the attention to football baffles me sometimes . 
I shall soon know how many videos I have , I'm going to include my series videos like True Blood and Air Gear though . 
I have 1,102 video files . Though I think the majority of them are series , my guesstimation on actual movies is 290 . sounds fun no ? 
The interwebs is so big , but it seems like theres nothing for me to do on it anymore but stair at FB ... sad day . army needs to come faster . 
A politician sees\ 
his family everyday , a deployed soldier once in six months ( or less ) . A\ 
politician flies 1st class , a soldier flies in a C130 . A politician's\ 
pension is not reduced , a soldier's is clawed 65% . A politician enjoys\ 
an expense account , a soldier must justify extra rations . A politician\ 
... vows to defend this country , a soldier actually keeps that promise . \

To find my who ever\ 
Where ever she may be\

It feels like the world is trying to drive me back into my highschool years , well the feeling I had then all the time at least , every thing I choose right now is starting to remind me more and more of it . It feels like I'm being pulled into it , unless I sit her and do nothing at all . 
I have no idea why I'm watching the saw movies .... so creepy . 
I'm watching The Chronicles of Riddick for like the 10th time , and there are parts , that I swear weren't in here before .... 
So , those of you that know me know I have really weird dreams . and last night I had a bunch of weird dreams . I had a dream that I was trying to get my friend's GF to go out with me and then I was singing and playing a 5 string bass in a concert that looked like it was in a store . then the dream completely changed to like night time and I was going to this house in a desert , then it ...
