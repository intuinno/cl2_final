Please God , don't ever let anyone tell Obama what number comes after a trillion . 
In San < PROPFIRST > McDonalds can't put toys in their happy meals because the government is trying to take control and make this a socalist country .. Government shouldn't be able to control what foods we can sell ... This is just lovely . 
The only reason im late is because I got attacked by a Pokemon while I was walking through the grass : l 
I have a love hate relationship with my surroundings . I love my bed but im starting to seriously dislike my alarm clock . 
A Veteran is someone who , at one point in their life , wrote a blank check payable to the United States of < PROPFEMALE > for an amount up to , and including , their life . That is beyond honor , and there are way too many people in the country who no longer remember that fact . Copy and paste this as your status if you are a Veteran , child of a Veteran , know a Veteran , Love a Veteran , or support the Troops ! 
I was crazy once . They locked me in a rubber room . I died there . They buried me . The worms ate me . I hate worms . They drive me crazy . Crazy ? I was crazy once ...

Painting some rocks white just in case some kid starts a snowall fight . 
In 1910 I bet people thought that in 2010 we would have flying cars and robots . But no , the biggest fads were shaped rubber-bands and backwards bath robes . 
Tripping and falling into the bath tub is more common than you might care to think . A recent ASFB poll shows that a shocking 89% of Americans have either fallen , or know someone who’s fallen into a bath tub . It’s time to let the world know of this impending crisis . Repost this as your status for at least 1 hour to show your support for bath tub fall victims . We shall be silent no longer . 
I don't think I could ever stab someone . I can barely get the straw in the Capri Sun . 
People who investigate strange noises in horror movies deserve to die . 
New game show coming soon ! Who wants to be an American ? Winner gets green-card . Losers get financial aid and don't have to pay taxes . 
Today , I spent five minutes shaking a bowl of Jello because it looked cool . I regret nothing . 
Manamana dododododoo ... 
I really want to change my Fb name to NO ONE . That way when I like someones status it will say \NO ONE likes your status . \ " xDD " 
If attitude was a tool I'd be a weapon of mass destruction , or at least a butter knife . 
I sent an Angel to watch over you last night . They returned sixty seconds later . When I asked why , they said , \Angels don't watch over other Angels . \"" 
Has the best boyfriend ever . 
Some friendships are like Caprisun straws - Nearly impossible to Break . 
Unicorns are so cute and I love them ...

Are you facing me ? What ? \ 
Are You Facing Me ? No . \ 
Then which way are you facing ? Toward you . \ 
-_- ! 
My mommy bought me a unicorn ! 
Sometimes when I'm bored , I walk into my room , and stand in there and pretend I'm a carrot . 
< PROPFEMALE > !! Thats what I meant . 
Dear God , thank you for my completely crazy , imaginative , creepy , wild friends . Without them , I would be completely sane .
