This is my new Facebook . 

I grow weary of your disingenuous assertions . ;) 
Landen your my best friend , but damn you need anger management ! 
“He who joyfully marches to music in rank and file has already earned my contempt . He has been given a large brain by mistake , since for him the spinal cord would surely suffice . ” < PROPFIRST > Einstein 
Perhaps today will shape out to be an interesting day . I will have a good time with some friends at Landens tonight . 
Last night was fun , giant marshmallow fight , about 20 games of pool , Xbox , watched a couple movies , < PROPMALE > got hit with a flying pimp smack , and Reiber disappeared in the middle of the night . Always a great time . 
False persona's can become rather annoying . I grow weary of convenient masks and ruses . 
Finished my technology paper on the UH-60L Black Hawk . It reads just a military spec < PROPMALE > , to the point , dry , and informative . Pay back for narrowing my topic and making it boring . 
Bored , not to many people to talk to in Gayfield . What shall I do ? 
I grow weary of trying to be nice , trying to be respectful . It never works out . Perhaps I should start acting like a jerk , or just stop trying all together . 
First good news in nearly a year and a half of constant surgeries and Doctor appoints . I found out today my last surgery was a success , my eardrum is still healing but there are no holes . This is amazing ! All I need now is to fix my left eardrum . I feel so great and relieved ! 
Just got back from a good bike ride . I think I will play Forza Motorsport 3 , I love to listen to the engine roar when I race the Lexus Eclipse Advan SC430 . 
I want to see an Epic Rape Battles of History parody between Master Chief and Commander Shepard . 
I cannot wait for for next year . Being an upper classmen , and one more year closer to getting the hell outa school . Plus I will be 17 and able to enlist in the Marines . OOH-RAH ! 
had to bottle feed a calf . His mom has rejected him .. I shall name him Hershey , because of his brown fur .

Hershey head butted me in the stomach after he drank the bottle of milk empty . I got taken down by a brown calf half my size . 
School just wont end fast enough ! 
I am so offended that people called my Adolf in history today ... Its like a compliment , and an insult at the same time ! I am nothing of that matter . 
Some people live an entire lifetime and wonder if they have ever made a difference in the world , but the Marines don't have that problem . \
