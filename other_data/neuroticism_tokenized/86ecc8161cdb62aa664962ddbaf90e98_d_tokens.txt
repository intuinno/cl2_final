That's right , < PROPMALE > Cooper , you make those Cylon jokes on prime time cable television ! 
Social Media Marketing Project , you are my monomaniacal muse -- it is mysterious indeed , the way dalliance gives way to devotion ... 
So SyFy is now showing techno-thrillers like the Bourne Identity and Casino Royale ? F-Yea ! Way to not suck , inconsistent genre network ! 
I think it's funny that people try to erase one another -- to run away from the pain by destroying the artifacts of what was .

What is it with people loving wind power until they have to look out their window and see a wind farm ? When I look wind turbines , I can't help but be struck by a sense wonder . A view of a wind farm is a majestic vista of human progress .

Obstacles and signs . Perilous and looming . Dangerous and moving . Dangerous and moving .

WTF ! 
Oh lady lend your hand outright And let me rest here at your side Have faith and trust In peace she said And filled my heart with life 
So I found out that < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Dio died while I was at the best show of my life . That definitely tempers the disappointment . That and meeting the singers of Dark Tranquilllity and Threat Signal ... and touching Mikael Stanne's fluffy hair during the show

I think my phone that should have died two weeks ago finally actually died 
I fail at being an Iron Maiden fan :-P Just now listening to \The Final Frontier\ " and it's freaking amazing ! " 
Liked the making of ' Flight 666 ' documentary that I saw on BBC International back in fall 2008 more than the actual documentary . I think it's < PROPFIRST > McFadyen's voice . 
Hoping to make it on Tuesday to the lecture I just found out about today that's on a civil war battle I first learned about this past Saturday . Yay Grammar ! 
Watching State of the Union . Bored . Longing for 2008 when Obama still gave erudite speeches that sound like grad school lectures . 
Pour the sorrows into the sun 
taking a brain-break with \Plan 9 from Outer Space \"" 
I officially have 666 pictures of myself on Facebook :-P 
< PROPFIRST > Haughm's description of Folk Metal : \Pagan-themed party music\ " .... win ! " 
< PROPFEMALE > Honeyman wasn't exaggerating when she told me that the lineup for this year's NE Metal and Hardcore Festival was atrocious . I think it's about time the promoter takes the leap and changes the name to \The New England Metalcore and Hardcore Festival \"..." 
A blatu blande bitos biuon ! \ 
A m ' atriia , a < PROPFEMALE > helvetia ! \ 
No 3IoB but it was still one a < PROPFEMALE > zing show ! 
Tristania is direct support for Kamelot's US tour ????... that's so AWESOME ... if ... wait ? It's not 1999 ? NM . That's not awesome in any way . 
it goes on and on and on and on ... 
Just listened to the new Sirenia single . Ugh . I didn't think this band could go any further down hill . 
My photos have gone down from 666 to 663 ? Hmmmm ... 
is having cover letter writers block ... I don't have time for this 
And if we could grip and hold on to the note\ 
We would see our minds were free ... oh they're free 
Comps !!! Comps comps comps comps comps 
KHAAAAAA ... OMPS ! 
But summer is a-coming and arise ! Arise ! 
As sorry as I am to not be seeing Agalloch on the Vernal Equinox , I guess that's a good thing since I'm tied up with Comps all day ... ah crap I totally forgot about the Super < PROPFEMALE > last night ... bah ! 
3 Inches of Blood dropped the Skeletonwitch show at O'Briens ... stupid . 
Our fortress is burning against the grain of the shattered sky 
Listening to new CoB . Disappointed . Unsurprised . 
Somehow I'd forgotten that I have one of Windir's albums .... score ! 
Listening to The Birthday Massacre 
Was just reading through old Skeletonwitch setlists and learned that First Unitarian Church of Philly hosts metal shows .... U.U. = most awesome religion ever , excessive Thoreau quotes notwithstanding :-P 
THAT WAS AWESOME ! 
off for pancakes ! go BC Marathon Monday events ! BBQ to follow 
want to stay home and listen to Witchfynde instead of going to a student organization dinner 
So Anathema is playing in Boston on May 21 ? I was kind of excited until I realized they now play wispy darkwavish prog instead of death/doom . :-/ 
Group presentation over ! This weekend can't come soon enough ! 
< PROPMALE > wedding excitement ... does not compute 
A whole bunch of Doom is my kind of celebration ! \ 
MT's 5YR ANNIV . SHOW ( day 2 ) w/ NOVEMBERS DOOM , WOODS OF YPRES , GWYNBLEIDD+ 
That was such a good show ! 
The A Game of Thrones series on HBO isn't bad but The Borgias and The Tudors on Showtime are definitely better at pulling off the immersive , morally-ambiguous , decadent , ironic , ruthless , period piece-thing that made < PROPFIRST>'s books so freaking good . 
Holy crap there's a coyote outside my office 
Got my phone back ! And got to see < PROPFEMALE > , Wren , and < PROPFIRST > along the way somehow ! Win ! 
Got my final grades ! Graduate studies over ! ( for now ) 
... people of < PROPMALE > land , it's only just begun ... 
Thanks for all the birthday wishes , everyone ! I had a great weekend and wish more of you could have been here to share it with ! 
I think that the movie \Hanna\ " is pretty much the best example of an Anime-style \ " child super assassin\ " film that has ever been made :-P " 
Jex Thoth is so freaking good ! 
History Channel ironic statement of the day : \MonsterQuest Science Team ... \"" 
Just ordered my tickets for Rites of Darkness III :-D
