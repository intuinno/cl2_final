I looked up at the night sky alone and saw a comet go by , It popped up for a split second then disappeared again , When I think of you I start to hurt , I want to see you now , but I cant fly through the sky .

Today the sky is crying .

I went 53 -?- 4 in Dom Shipment yesterday and deleted my picture by accident = \\ 
How pathetic , that SP puts up an Em quote on the announcements today , when it is a song that everyone knows . I don't understand this , Why not put something up by someone who is more of a positive role model ? Don't get me wrong , Em is one of my favorite rappers , but why won't these announcements stop brainwashing the students with what they already know , and put up quotes by a more positive rapper , such as Common ? 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY YOUNHA W000000000000T : ]

OMG USA ... We still got this , 
USA = 2014 World Cup Champions 
Taking drive thru orders is good . But I fail at multi-tasking with it and the McCafe stuff . FML with that , also FML when I can barely understand what people are saying ... Other then that , it's good , just like taking orders inside and it seems like it makes time go faster =] 
Wasn't Facebook supposed to be a pay to use website since its July now or something ? 
C'mon you EMINEM STANS , you really think this Recovery album is good ? Now I'm not gonna get into much detail because I havnt finished listening , but if you think this stuff is good , why don't you go ask more quality rap music listeners , they'll probably tell you Em ten years ago is way better then this new stuff . and eww lil < PROPMALE > is on it Lol , thats a minus ~ 
Happy 4th of July fellow Americans ! 
Just felt like saying this ... Eminem is not as good as he was before , he's like rapping about what he hated 10 years ago . WTF ? Em made his lyrics towards the mainstream crowd . He is out of his prime .

If the Packers make the Superbowl then I'm rooting for the Jets . But then again they wont go that far cause the Bears are gonna win it all ;) 
It all makes sense now , Blackhawks won , Bears will win Superbowl , Bulls will win later , and Cubs will win at the end of the year ;) 
Trying to write a short story but I can't think of anything worthy D: 
: ) 
I can see the future of the Packers , and that future is defeat . 
First . I touch status ! 
green bay paid the refs to call those cheap plays D: 
In all honesty , Packers were stopped by Bears defense but Bears could not hold it up . Good Game both teams !

I dont know who Eminem is anymore ... I used to call him my favorite rapper until Relapse came out . Then Recovery came out and everyone started riding him . I do like LTWYL but Recovery isnt as good as the hype it had , and I see the same fate with his next album . R.I.P. Eminem Infinite/SSLP/MMLP/Eminem Show version of Eminem . Looking forward to Detox . 
Sometimes I wish these Pisces horoscope things would say you'll have a relaxing day where work is a breeze , your failures in school will find new light and accomplishment , etc ..........
