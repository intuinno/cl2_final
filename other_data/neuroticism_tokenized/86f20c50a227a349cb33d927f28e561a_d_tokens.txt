... Bored 

i hate this weather 
dropping my brothers backpack at his middle school and the lady at the desk asks me \are you late for class ? \ " is that a compliment or insult ? " 
What's on YOUR mind ? 
no one wants to be \different\ " but no one wants to be \ " average \"" 
bored 
very bad weather today
