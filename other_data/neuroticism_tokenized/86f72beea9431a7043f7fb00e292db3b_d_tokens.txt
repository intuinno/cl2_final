Dear Friends , I am sorry but somehow everyone got something from me stating that I have tagged them in Sims . I don't remember authorizing Facebook to do so ... It's total BS . I just looked at this application because I played it on my comp six or seven years ago ( The real game ) . Again , sorry about that . 
Just came back from < PROPFIRST > Miller Orchestra concert . It was amazing and wonderful . Listening to their music live puts you somewhere else - mostly to 50s and 60s . And yet , the music sets your mood so high that you forget anything negative in your life . Beautiful ! My soul is still singing ! 
Well , finally got my citizenship and now going to Thunderbird to get my MBA . Hoooray ! 
Just passing the point on education :\
