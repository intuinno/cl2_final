Damn , damn , damn . My best friend is still grounded . ROAR 
I'm getting extremely tired with our group , unfortunately all the cool eighth graders are freshmen now so I have nowhere else to < PROPFEMALE > out . 
Thinking about at least attempting to acquire a < PROPFIRST > for once . But all the people getting their knickers in a twist because they do not have one just repulses me ... 
AAAAAGH ! I do not dress appropriately for walking two and a half < PROPMALE > home from school in the sun . 
Minecraft , oh minecraft .

alright , sounds like a blast ! 
greatest lie of them all , \Is your game almost to a save point ? \ " \ " .... yes .. \"" 
It seems like I talk to the people I actually want to talk to much , much less than I talk to the people I don't . 
Ugh .... I slept like a drowning mime . 
Rain , rain come and stay . Go away some other day . 
I hate the Roomba slogan , \It's time to let the robots do the work for you . \ " Since when did we do work for robots ??? "

R & J was great ! Good job Demon Drama ! 
Friendship is a fickle beast , indeed , and is not a thing to be trifled with . It can disperse by something as trivial as a nonsensical quarrel . So tell me , would you rather have a small number of close and good friends , or a large number of not so good friends . 
At the school ... Security cameras , security cameras everywhere ... They're always watching ... -.- 
Tonight , I conquered my nemesis , The Kitchen , and his sidekick , Cooking , and concocted a magnificent dinner for myself and < PROPFEMALE > . I have accomplished a feat that surpasses even the almighty Cooking Mama !!! 
Six nose bleeds in less than a week ... I don't think that's normal . :/ 
Oh man , lunch was awesome today . Liam and I turned < PROPFEMALE > into about a dozen different things moving from one movie genre to the next . \ 
Opening scene :\ 
< PROPFEMALE > wakes up on a curb in a black trench coat with a crumpled pack of cigarettes in her pocket . It's raining . She gets up and starts walking in any given direction and a stray dog follows her . She tries to light a cigarette , but her lighter won't light due to rain . 
Finally , Spring Break ! But , I'm leaving immediately to Vegas and won't be back ' til Friday . 
Ugh , only two more hours until we're in Vegas ... Good thing I have my iPod and phone ... 
Cow divide by pig equals money . 
Am I the only one who actually likes the taste of orange juice after brushing my teeth ? 
Criss Angel's Believe was an hour and a half of 100% badassery . 
I just accidentally saw twenty seconds of Jersey Shore and I have never regretted my actions so much 
Finally heading back home from Vegas . Now I just have to endure six hours in the backseat whilst wallowing in sickness and pain . Text me . 
Getting my nostalgia on with Animal Crossing :D 
Pwning teh noobs at Liam's bithday party .

Blehhh . Whatever I had in Vegas has caught up with me ... 
Anyone have tips for pulling weeds ? Listening to the Eagles helps , but it isn't sufficient . 
Mr. Beyda is most definitely the coolest teacher in Cholla . 
Recommend to me a good anime , I finished Naruto , so now I'm sad .
