Poll to the friends out there .... Astros are 0-4 , have been outscored 26-6 in 4 games , is it too early in the season to wear the proverbial paper bag over my head when I go to the game tomorrow ? 
Astros now 0-8 . For all the teachers out there who need a word of the day tomorrow , E is for Embarrassing . 
WOW @ Survivor 
Breaking news , the Astros won today ! Now wake up to the shock of that and < PROPFEMALE > on with your Friday . LOL .

Working on this week's survivor blog entry ! 
FINALLY got around to watching Survivor ! < PROPFIRST > put it best , \genius is what that was \"!" 
I repeat : The Specialist , The Mentalist , and The Assassin ! That's all , folks ! 
Only one team worse in baseball than your 4-10 Astros . You guessed it , The Boston Red Sox . 
All I can say is that was one of the most memorable tribal councils ever . Just .... memorable . 
You can't pull the wool over the undercover specialist ! 
6 pm and the day is about half over ... 
Time for the Amazing Race finale , go Globetrotters ! 
If your name is < PROPFEMALE > , you should really apply to the show Survivor , align yourself with a strong puppet master , let them do all the work , then cash a check for a million bucks after 39 days ! 
Umps let a Met walk on 3 balls in the 6th inning . Even more troubling , the Astros didn't even notice . 
Excited for the Survivor finale tonight . Will this finally be the season of the Robfather ? 
I'll be surprised if it isn't 9- 0-0 < PROPMALE > . 
Returning players , my early favorites are < PROPFEMALE > from Nicaragua and < PROPMALE > from this season . Not a fan of either . Who would you like to see back ? #survivor 
All together now ... let's go Bulls ! 
Can't believe I just paid 64 bucks for gas to fill up , then I thought , what if that's As Good as it Gets ? ;)

< PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > says goodbye for now , but shall soon return ! :) 
Let's not crown the Heat just yet ! 
And the Miami Heat have started their collapse a quarter early tonight . 
Not a good idea to 1 ) be a congressman , 2 ) send lewd photos of yourself to strangers over the net , and 3 ) have a last name Weiner . Let the jokes begin . 
Don't confuse that ghost your seeing with LeBron < PROPFIRST > in the 4th quarter . One in the same . #nbafinals 
Somebody call 911 ... the overrated , overhyped Miami Heat are choking on a slice of humble pie . 
When we deceive for personal gain , we make Jesus cry . ~ < PROPMALE > Cooper 
With the first pick in the NBA draft , LeBron < PROPFIRST > selects a legitmate PR representative . 
I'd just like to inform everyone that July having 5 Fridays , 5 Saturdays , and 5 Sundays happens once every 7 years and incorrectly posting that it happens once every 823 years will not bestow any good fortune upon you . Thanks for listening . :) 
Dear Facebook : If you're looking for me , I'll be hanging out at Google+ . Hasta la vista , baby . 
In < PROPMALE > using the wonderful free Wi-Fi . Sad to be gone from < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > but happy to be returning in 6 weeks . As it was once said , you have to go back , < PROPFIRST > , you have to go back !!!
