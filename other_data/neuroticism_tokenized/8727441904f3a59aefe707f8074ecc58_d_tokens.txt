Inspiration is Food not only for the Soul but for your Dreams . 
Something I will < PROPFEMALE > on with me and pass on to my children and anyone else who would plan this ..... Never EVER move in with your bf/gf/spouse/etc . and your in-laws . Only and maybe if its temporary but like years , NO ! 
I still recall the day when i first got my braces and couldn't eat hardly anything not even some lettuce(salad ) and a few days after it was my Brothers wedding ... all that lovely food i could not eat , and one day i finally broke-down crying in frustration ( and my love for food of course xD lol !! ) atleast i got to eat some of that wedding cake :3 hell no i would not let that go by . 
Watched Avatar : The Last Air-bender last night it was good :D , rushed but good .

Love Rainy days and the moment after it rains and the sun comes out with a freshly cleaned sky ....... hmmm Portugal smells of Mexico . But there are no tacos or raspados ;_; 
Yay ! Halo Reach ! :D Thanks Thierry . 
I've accepted the fact that there are ppl out there that would judge and not accept a person based on their sexual orientation .... But I wont tolerate it . 
I'm craving for a Pina Colada ._. 
Finally getting a hair-cut ( well a trim really ) , I've been shedding like a wig and 1/2 everyday . >:[ 
:O We were going to go out to the movies but then we came a cross this stray Black Kitten who kept meowing . We brought her home now , and shes a little energetic fur-ball lol ... Makes me think of Miragies ;( i miss her . 
I find it funny how most the time the weather can match my mood . 
Great ... Just realized KH : Birth by sleep is out and i need to get a PSP * sigh * cant they just freaking release them on one stinking consol >:[ gawd ... KH is the most expensive thing i've been a fan of to date ... 
I finally got a sore throat to a point its hard to swallow . Wow haven't been sick since Graduation in LP HS being around all these sick ppl/students/friends ! You guys are nasty ! >:O haha xD 
I just watch Daybreakers ... i got so weak x_x but good movie . 
Just watched Eclipse and it sucked , was too rushed and was boring over all ( lovey dovey < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > scenes make me feel awkward for some reason lol ) . Yesterday watched the expendable and that was boring too . Felt like i was watching a movie for the 100th time only this time with every Rambo hunk in it :S such films these days . I did however finally watched District 9 and i loved it . one of my Fav :) 
Just had a dream that about us ( you know our gang of friends ) back in LPHS , that we had all gone on a trip to < PROPFEMALE > . Idk what part of < PROPFEMALE > but we were already there and i was looking forward to trying out their food lol ! xD 
There are some people I wish i never had in my life , but i realize that without them i would not have met some of the people/friends i know now .

To everyone who is calling for stricter gun laws in light of the tragedy in Tuscon , may I offer this little tidbit : If guns kill people , pencils misspell words , cars drive drunk , and spoons made Oprah fat ! Remember : Hold the person accountable for their actions , not just the means they chose to utilize . Don't just like it , re-post it !! Plus if guns are outlawed - only outlaws will have guns !!! 
Drives me nuts when ppl use the weirdest words in typing . Like yus for \yes\ " and dat for \ " that . \ " ...... its not that hard to spell geez . -_-;" 
Coming home this march !!! :O 
Man ... Sometime i cant bare such strong emotions like anger . Like it wants to explode out of me and makes me wonder ... Thats why we're not born with powers . We do enough to ourselves with weapons ... can only imagine . 
Wow .... just saw in the news here that an old lady was found dead in her apartment and that shes been dead for 8 year .... She was also found with her dead dog .
