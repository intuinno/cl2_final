Donkey Kong Country 2 on my computer !!! That's what's up ! 
Hahahahahha oh my god Laughing my ass off !!! So we got a tree ! Here is the funny part < PROPMALE > tied the tree to the hood of the car but we couldn't get in hence the rope holding the doors closed . We had to climb through the windows !!!!! LOL 
So excited < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > are going to come visit us in Hawaii !!! They will be here tomorrow night just in time to help decorate the christmas tree =)

Hanging with jeneric cooking some bomb pasta and then it's game time =) Scriblish & Loaded Questions . Can't wait ! 
Awesome couple of days =) lovin < PROPFEMALE > & < PROPFIRST > here in hawaii last night hanging out though =( 
Does anyone know some home remedies that I can put in my christmas tree water to help keep the tree fresh ? 
Dishes done by hand since can't use dishwasher because well plumber needed to fix the garbage disposal which is now causing dishwasher to not drain all the way . But counter tops & stove clean sweeping done mopping in process and almost to the bathroom . Then shower & head to the store for food for dinner hopefully before < PROPMALE > gets home . 
It's pointless really what's the point no matter how much I sweep how much I mop or clean this house never gets clean ! I've swept twice mopped and the floor is still somehow dirty ! I give up !!! And on top of it my house now smells like crap from the hardwood floor cleaner =( 
Wooohoooo my sink is now fixed thanks to my handy dandy plumber =) 
Crazy thunder & lightning storm here on Oahu right now !!! It's kinds exciting lol 
Ugh now my dishwasher isn't working the water that's in it won't drain & I don't know what to do ... Anyone have any idea ? 
Finally done with this damn level Bramble Scramble only took forever ! Donkey Kong Country 2 
Damn this rollar coaster level I die at the same spot BLAHHHH !!!! 
Yay ! My christmas tree is all decorated and looks amazing =) 
Ahhhhhhhhh !!! Grrrrrraaahhhhhh !!!!! Wtf this damn level !!!!!! Hate hate hate is what I have !!!!!! HATE ! 
Out with < PROPMALE > at her work Christmas party ! Thank god she got me out =) 
Poor < PROPMALE > has been gone for 20 mins to get food just 2 mins down the street . She gets home and they forgot a hamburger she paid for and the fries are stale & cold ! She's going back to raise hell lol as would I !!!!! 
I can't sleep ! Ugh !

Geckos make a chirping noise I've seen and heard it BUT < PROPMALE > won't agree with me just to not agree . So has anyone heard what a gecko sounds like ? 
I miss the days when I had friends who would call or text me to come < PROPFEMALE > out . Even of it's not doing much . Sucks feeling alone . 
The lightning is pretty cool and I want to take a picture but I don't know how to set my camera to take a picture right away & not have to take 3 seconds to focus . Annoyed . 
This whole zosiac sign changing is just stupid ! I don't believe it . How can years of relating to your sign with your personality just all of a sudden change ? It's like saying the months changed and your birthday is no longer the day in which you know it to be . 
Mmmmm toaster strudel I forgot how yummy you were =)

Who says I have to be miserable =) 
Surprise you've got flowers =) What a wonderful thing to wake up to =) There isn't a note but my guess is < PROPMALE > somehow someway got me some beautiful flowers . I'm such a lucky girl to have such a wonderful caring man to make me feel loved even if he can't be here to tell me himself . 
Mmmmm sushi dinner all by myself =) 
Seriously Buried was so annoying the worst movie I have seen all year !!! I can't believe I sat through that . 
I'm so hot =( Broken ac sucks it's to hot in my room =( 
Baseball game beers hot dogs = a great time =) woot woot ! Hahaha 
Good workout at the gym and another great workout going up and down my stairs arms full with grocery bags . I almost didn't make it the last trip lol My body is tired but it feels good . Now time for a healthy dinner . Chicken and veggies =) 
Two commercials in a row where I'm like REALLY ? Lol one is about a new 5 hr energy type drink \it works for me\ " well it shows some chick at the gym that is wearing a clevege showing workout sports bra . Haha really chick you boobies are not supported and are going to flop out . Who works out in that ? Then a California commercial with < PROPFIRST > kardashian laying out at a pool reading a quantum physics book !!! Lol REALLY ?! " 
Wow ! Being from CA and experiencing earthquakes now and then . Hawaii just had a pretty good jolt or my house is going to fall down . I mean do we even get earthquakes here ? 
I'm in such a bad mood thanks to the rooster cock-a-doodle-doo-ing alllllll night last night ! I got no sleep =( until I closed the window at 8am and turned on the broken ac that goes drip drip drip ! I got sleep finally but resulted in nothing getting done today . Annoyed . 
Damn these cock-a-doodle-doooos need to shut up !!!!!! One starts far away then wakes the others in the valley and it's like a damn rooster farm . Ugh ! FML FML FML !!!! 
Im bored ..... 
I really miss my < PROPMALE > =(

After an hour of crying thanks to the show coming home I am so ready to hear Jonathans voice ! Miss you ! 
My left lymph node is really swollen and hurts like hell .... Ugh ! I cant sleep . Should i make an appointment with the dr or dentist ? It doesn't feel like i have a cavity and my throat doesn't hurt ... This sucks ! 
Oh god oh god Hawaii Tsunami Watch !!!! Is it going to be larger than last time ? Im scared ! 
uh oh ! Earthquake on Big Island ..... 
What is the point why are you people getting gas ????? I dont get it ... We are an Island you cant drive across the ocean ... And our streets are just going to be full with water anyway . 
Uhhhhhh Midway from Japan to Oahu wave seen to be 8ft !!!! I hope that goes down and doesn't get any bigger . 
1st wave hit and the water level came up the shore some but no damage . Who knows this might just go on all night and no big Tsunami . Freaking out and staying up all night being aware of whats going on . Better safe than sorry . I'm tired ! 
OH MY GOD A HUGE WAVE IS COMING THIS IS NO JOKE IM FREAKING OUT !!!!!! 
Ok its so creepy the water being sucked from the shore and seeing all the reef . I keep anticipating a huge wave to crash but nothing . It just keeps creeping back up the shore . 4 or 5 times of this for about an hr Im so tired ! To sleep or not to sleep ? 
Well after a very long night and morning things seem fine here in Oahu . The warning is still going on & the ocean is still acting up . So we will see . 
A little girl on the show coming home said the cutest thing when her dad came home . She said \its like hugging a rainbow\ " toooooo adorable ! " 
I always have strange freaky messed up dreams ... I want to know why this is . Does anyone know what I should do . Getting a dream book might not explain to me as good as a person might . Is there such thing as dream specialists ??? Should I see a therapist ? What should I do ? I don't ever feel like you do when having a nightmare I always want to finish out the dream ... Can anyone give me some advice ? 
One month and I will be in California ! Can't wait to be there =) 
Ugh my body is still sore from yesterdays gym sesh and going again tomorrow I hope I can make through it . 
Is anyone going out tomorrow night for st pattys day ?

Oh I forgot to mention that my trainer asked if I had gotten on a scale recently since 2 weeks ago I of cource haven't . She asked cause she said I looked thinner !!! YaY !!!! I'm not getting on that scale for another 2 weeks though =) I just don't want to be dissapointed if I haven't ... But it seems I just might have =)

Who do we need to contact and how long does it take to get the navy movers to your house to pack things ...

There is a < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > will be restricted for the full 30 days which falls onto Oct 1st when we need to be out .
