Just Wants To Let You Know .. That Falling In Love With You Was The Best Thing I Ever Did ... <3 

If im such am amazing person y do i always get hurt 
If u only knew that just hearing ur voice makes my eyes bleed tears of pain 
i just want someone to care ...... that's it ..... its that simple but then again i never get what i want in life 
i love how right when i wish i would hear from him ... he texts me and my eyes light up !!!! 
\i was born to tell you i love you\ " C.G.W. <3 A.D.W. " 
I just want to say that I'm soooooo glad that we had a good day today and that I love u with all my heart !! Ur amazing and I hope u know that I love and caee about u bunches and bunches !!! 
yeah so im a lil freaked out lol ( i love u < PROPFEMALE > ) 
Navy sailor at ur service 
Glad i found an amazing place 2 stay ! im definitly blessed ! 
Oh man moment ! broken bottle of polish hit the hands of its neglector 
Im off 2 oklahoma 4 the weekend no cell phone service so i wnt get ur texts till sunday 
I love u too !!!! :) 
I miss u too 
i never thought this would happen to me but im glad it did 
im glad that u r in my life i love you bunches and bunches !!! Ur amazing !!! 
Im looking forward to a christmas where i know i can relax and just be myself for once . Where i dnt have to walk on egg shells !!! :D 
\separate like the fingers of the hand\ " -Invisible Man- think about it its deep :) " 
When you love someone u have to be willing to give them everything and expect nothing in return !! 
Ur the one thing i cant stand to loose .... the inspiration for my smile ..... the warmth in my soul 
i have had a totally amazing day !!!!!! Im so excited and totally hyper !!! 
all those thoughts in my head , all those misconseptions , everything i thought i believed all changed the day i met you 
my mind is full of a roller coaster of thoughts ...... just hope everything will work out in the end 
let us cast ourselves into a world of wonder and peace and find exactly who we want to be . 
øWishes that life could go back to the days when the biggest decison was whether to jump on the trampoline or play in the dirt ........ life sure is a rolle 
ør coaster we all just have to learn to hold on 
i just want to say thank you to everyone and anyone who has ever been there for me !!!! I love you all !!! 
those who are weak , those who are thirsty come to the fountain and dip your heart into the stream of life 
Totally a happy face moment :D < PROPFEMALE > understands :) 
i wonder will i ever break free from the shadows that consume me 
tired of all the deception and games people play lets go back to the good old days why cant we just all be honest with people and show the respect we want and deserve 
Wants to crawl within herself and reclaim the essence of who she really is .. wants to find the light that shines within her heart 
pain strikes the heart with a disease ... a disease that spreads throughout shattering all thoughts of hope all thoughts of happiness .... why cant pain loose its path to me 
is trying not to believe in something she knows will never happen ...... sigh ...... im so tired of this reocurring cycle of emotions 
lets skip the reminising and drown ourselves in the good of the day ... consume ourselves in anything that makes us smile ... surround ourselves with happiness 
i wanna break the boundaries set infront of me\ 
destroy the hatred that attempts to consume me \ 
envoke the love that resides in me \ 
all in hopes to become what i know i can\ 
achieve the dreams i picture in my head 
why is it that just one little message can destroy ur whole day \ 
and its always from someone who could care less if they hurt you or not \ 
\ 
i really just need to work on seeing the hurt in people instead of their cruelness\ 
to see the reason behind the action instead of just the action itself\ 
i need to learn to love with more compassion and respect without judgement\ 
i need to become less selfish 
will someday find what she hopes for but until then honestly im done trying 
I wish people could just see whats infront of them and go after them ... realise that if u think someone is amazing u might want to grab them b4 someone else does 
Just dance .... def-an embarrassing blast of fun :D thanks to the awesome donation .... GOD def loves us all :D 
woke up in an amazing mood .... can't wait to see what today offers :) 
i had an awesome day and finally got my ribs :) 
You can't change your past , only your future !! So let today be the start of the rest of your life !! 
Woke up in that today will be a great day attitude :) 
Had an awesome day :) thanks to a pretty awesome chick :) 
¬Hoping that in the end everything works out the way it should be .... that life will stay as magical as it seems for once .... that i can continue to wake up 
¬ believing that today will be amazing :)

to all the girls at saving grace i wrote u all little notes and cant wait to give them to u :) 
you know the thing that really bugs me about things ???? \ 
Its that i always see in others what they cant see themselves ...... it drives me crazy to see what i know someone is deserving and capable of and watch them listen in disbelief of what i believe 
my mind is full of contemplations ; what do i do ; i turn to you 
i need you , like a needle needs a vain , like a lighthouse needs a coast ........ so thank u for being willing to be there for me :) 
i made myself a promise today :) im very happy to see if i can keep it 
i honestly dont think today could get any better ; well it could if something else happened ... 
all things worth having require working hard for :)

in beginning to see the strength that is within me :) i just hope that i can be the person that i want to be , reach the goals i have set to achieve , conquer the fears that still reside inside of me ......... only time can tell what i will be and who will be blessed enough to share this knowledge with me 
its crazy to think back to the moments that are memorable to me and realise just how much they transfer into who i am today .......

When life gives YOU lemons you can make all the lemonade you want but when life gives ME lemons I'm gonna make grape juice and your gonna wonder how I did it . 
def an amazing way to start off a day :) 
you're so mean when you talk about yourself you are wrong . change the voices in your head make them like you instead . so complicated . look how big you'll make it . filled with so much hatred . such a tired game . its enough i've done all i can think of . chased down all my demons . see you the same 
you used to captivate by your resignating light now im bound by the knife you left behind . your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams . 
so i officially have four wisdom teeth coming in at the same time :( and that is why i keep having fevers on and off all day and it sucks :( 
< PROPFEMALE > 
u slow shaking fingertips show that your scared like me so lets pretend we're alone and i know we may be scard i know we're unprepared but i dont care 
\climb to the everest in my mind\ " - < PROPMALE > :D you rock my mind " 
its 4 am im waking up to ur perfume . dont get up ill get through on my own . i dont know if im home or if I've lost the way into ur room . im spiraling into my doom . im feeling half alive , but i know one day you and i will be free .

i do not like you for who you used to be honestly i could care less\ 
i do not like you for the decisions that haunt ur past \ 
i love you for who you are today because in the end we all have a history\ 
moments that sting us with regret\ 
its the choices you make now in the present that make me fall in love with you all over again with everyday i spend with you
