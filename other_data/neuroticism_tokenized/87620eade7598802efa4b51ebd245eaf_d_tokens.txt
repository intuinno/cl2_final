happy new year everyone 

So here it is .... i know im not perfect and i know that im not the best friend a person can have or the best daughter or sister ...... so im writing this to tell you all im sorry 
when i get mad i say things that i dont mean things that would probably hurt yall .... i say things that im feeling inside me when im not around yall when i get mad about someting you did or said and its not right of me to do that but i always thought that if i would say them away from yall that i would not say them to your face and hurt you .... i thought that it was better in the long run 
but < PROPMALE > just informed me other wise .... so im wrighting this to apolagize to everyone and if you dont exept it i understand .... you know ive always had problems in my life ... and honestly i think i create most of them just so that i have something to do in my life ..... i try so hard to make everyone ells happy that i havent been happy in so long and i dont know how to make myself happy .... 
becouse making other people happy is what makes me happy .... im sorry that im such a bitch and that im so self centered that i try helplesly to please everyone and in the end i get so mad becouse i can never please everyone around me .... and this is for levi ..... baby im sorry that i am continusly nagging at things expecualy the things that i know i cant change 
im sorry that i have so much stress and im sorry that i am so klingie and always want you around i know you need your space and honestly i dont know why i have been the way i have the past year .... 
just honestly have not been happy becouse there is so much going on inside me im struguling so hard with some things that i havent said anything about becouse i have been trying to run from it becouse i thought that running from what has been going on inside would make things < PROPFEMALE > 
i didnt want to bother any one with it becouse it didnt contain to anyone ells but me . i cant go back and change the past but i can change the present and the future ... 
its not going happen over night but i promise you all that i am going to try to change to be a better person .... and better friend ... a better daughter ... a better sister ... and most of all a better wife to the love of my life . IM SORRY IT TOOK ME THIS LONG TO REALIZE MY MISTAKES . i just needed someone to show me what i was doing wrong i guess .. 
i just dont know what to do now ... ive tryed and tryed .... and just when things are going atleast ok they get 100 times worse in no time .... all i want is him to be here ... im sorry for everything ! im just going to go away now !

does any one in ohio know where to get fitted for a dress ? 
does life ever realy change ?... do people ever realy change ?.... sometimes i wonder and im beging to think that its not life or the people around us changing .... its all in our heads . we want people to change and we want life to change so bad for our own reasons that we start to think it has changed when it hasent . with a few minor diforences people are the same as they were in the 19 hundreds and so is life .
