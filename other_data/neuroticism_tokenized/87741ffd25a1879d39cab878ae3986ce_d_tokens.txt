I had a canker sore in the back of my cheek and my tooth kept on scraping it . It was there for a long time . It's gone now . :D 
Finally done with the Huckleberry Finn packet . too much excitement to be excited . Like when Cartman thought something was so funny he couldn't laugh . 
So I downloaded this Finale demo 2010 [ music generator ] thing and worked for hours on this music project I had stuck in my head for awhile . The thing is , I just skipped over all the stuff that was supposed to be read . There was actually a freakin pop up that explained everything once it was loaded but I had to be selfish with time and not read ANYTHING and just started composing . It turns out I can't save anything . 
the only part I don't like about school is 6th hour . no offense to Mr. Branch ... 
Done with my online class for this whole semester . Free 5th hour with nothing blocked = facebook hour .

To dream that you are playing a video game , represents your ability to manipulate others into doing what you want them to do . To see or dream that you are a character in a video game , suggests that you are feeling controlled and manipulated by others . What if I dreamed that myself is controlling myself in an arcade game ? 
My clock is really loud . 
Couldn't make the football game to watch the marching show . :( 
My dad is here !!!!! :D :D :D 
I don't think I can make it to the We Came as Romans ' concert ... but I get to < PROPFEMALE > out with my dad , so it's all good . :)

I am the ONLY euphonium in the ensemble ! And we're going to play ALL of the Lord of the awesome freaking Rings movements ! I couldn't be more excited !... I just wish there were more euphoniums ... 
Latency for WoW at college is over 9000 ... literally . :( 
Does anyone have a class at CC at 7:45 Tuesdays and/or Thursdays ? The bus I have to catch will be at the stop at around 6:00 , so I'll have to leave my house at around 5:55 , and that means I'll have to wake up at about 5:10 ... maybe earlier ... instead of 7:00 . I was just wondering if I could car pool with you , if you indeed have at class at 7:45 or around then . I'd greatly appreciate it . :D 
I wouldn't do much for a Klondike bar , but I'd kill for a clear nose . ugh

I can understand if the bus is a little late , but when it's going on 20 minutes , I am annoyed . 
I just fell down on the bus . :D 
Why do I always forget about English homework ? 
I just realized that I can just go from the Music Building to the 4th floor of Cook Hall by crossing the parking ramp , instead of going down stairs to get to the first floor of Cook Hall , and then back up to the 4th floor . face-palm 
I really really enjoyed Karate Kid with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Fish and < PROPFEMALE > Meines ! Couldn't think of a better way to end my day :)

Music theory homework . SO much fun . 
The bus smells like poop today :D 
I believe in Jesus Christ . One of my facebook friends challenged all believers to put this on their wall ... In the Bible it says , if you deny me in front of your peers , I will deny you in front of my father , at the Gates of Heaven . This is a simple test . If you love God you are not afraid to ... show it , repost this !!!

Every person has 1000 wishes . A cancer patient only has 1 : to get better . I know that 97% will not post this as their status , but I know that my friends will be one of the 3% and put this as their status , at least foran hour , in honor of those who died because of cancer or are still fighting it . 
I may just get out of this scale singing test . Tornado warning ftw :D 
Well that was just spiffy . Made it up to the third floor of the music building only to be sent back down because of a ' tornado ' warning . Got down to the first floor to sit for , quite literally , a second , only to be sent back up for an all clear . So . Many . Stairs . 
More than likely just aced the ' singing scales ' test . :D 
Great day to fly a kite ... sorta .

My theory : Facebook made the news feed font smaller so that it would hurt it's users eyes ; thus , they leave for awhile and go do something productive . 
Crazy lady yelling on the bus about losing her seat to a wheel chair and I'm trying not to laugh , old , creepy man asking little girls if he can kiss their cheeks ( upsetting people ) , and bus is crowded enough that everyone is breathing everyone else's breath . Weeeee

is starting to think Smosh is dumb . They're posting nothing but bad copy pasta dumps and terrible blogs/videos . 
Saturday math class from 8- 12:15 . Rapture . 
Hot chocolate mix mixed with milk does not make chocolate milk . Lesson learned . 
Maybe now is a good time to start on that theory homework ... 
Bayside tomorrow . œ ? Y“©KHœ¡“”J© ? ; HFYITU © ? ”F 
I like what's happening right now . Just sayin ' . 
Bayside was , hands down , the best concert I've ever been to . 
You know when you think of something that was fun and you smile and no one but you knows why ? Well that just happened . Except I was smiling AT someone , and , when I realized it , I noticed their o_O face . Awkward bus ride is awkward . 
My cat has a cold . I think his nose is stuffed :( 
just watched 5 Centimeters Per Second . ouchmyheart 
Bus was 9 minutes late . You know what I could've done with 9 minutes ? Anything that does not include freezing my ass off , that's what . 
Crappy ! Didn't know that my bus pass was all used up , I have no money for bus fair , and mom is at work . So , now I'm stranded at school . ; fhadljsnvkn ; caewuiyhkrflsiygxcuzkjb . nm 
Finally got home thanks to my pastor , < PROPMALE > Smith . Thanks again ! \ 
And also , < PROPMALE > has no serious sickness . The little cat is on antibiotics for an upper respiratory infection . So thankful for things right now ! 
My cat is snoring :3 
Hard to sleep when you can't . amiright ? 
Not sure if this history class can get more boring ... 
Uber fun just happened . Time for sleep . 
I will resist all sin to the point of blood , and I will wear my scars like badges of honor . ? My God is greater than this world . Also had a great time tonight . Gotta do that more often . :D 
Writing a romantic piece . Also some pork chops . mmm 
thinks that going sledding would be a really good idea . Possibly tomorrow or Saturday ? 
Happy with the way things are going . Just sayin . (: 
is now a baptized man . (:
