“Today , fashion is really about sensuality—how a woman feels on the inside . In the ' 80s women used suits with exaggerated shoulders and waists to make a strong impression . Women are now more comfortable with themselves and their bodies—they no longer feel the need to hide behind their clothes . ” < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > 
Fashion is not something that exists in dresses only . Fashion is in the sky , in the street , fashion has to do with ideas , the way we live , what is happening . Coco < PROPFEMALE >

Put this as your status if you know or love someone who is gay . My wish is that people will understand that being gay is not a disease or a choice .
