Is thinking about legally changing her name . 
Is reminded of an anecdote by Sartre : When speaking to an avid anti-semite , Sartre asks her about the cause of her hatred of Jews . She explains that she was once double-crossed by a Jewish furrier . He then wonders , why doesn't she distrust furriers , not Jews ? What is it really about race that turns otherwise intelligent people into non-thinkers ?

Feels like setting something on fire . A bag of skittles should do ...

Hate speech is just that . It doesn't matter the person it comes from , or it's targeted audience . Being intelligent doesn't excuse you from it , nor does it absolve any guilt . It's a symptom of a larger issue , a diseased way of thinking . If you engage in it , maybe you should take a moment and evaluate how open-minded you really are . 
is going to the firing range . 
I love lady gaga as much as the next person , but I can't help but become both riddles with concern and confusion when people claim that she is the only talented and unique voice to come out in the last decade .

is amazingly happy , pretty constantly as a matter of fact . 
is really tired of hearing people protest about the casting choices of The Last Airbender , the acting ability of the actors and staying true to the storyline of the show/book should be the most important . Not what race the actors are . It's not like it's a biopic of < PROPMALE > X or Hideyoshi Toyototomi where the race of the actors ( or the people themselves ) is actually fucking significant to the events that took place . 
needs to re-evaluate the type of friends that she attracts .

It will never cease to amaze me that people who preach tolerance , respect & compassion , as in religious tolerance , gay rights & etc . w/ their status updates are the same people that spread hate , bigotry & prejudice with their speech & every other statuses that they type . U have no room to judge other peoples inadequacies and prejudices ( i.e. people like Pastor < PROPFIRST > Jones ) when urs are so blatantly posted for all to see .

My girl crush is definitely < PROPFEMALE > Hill ... I would say < PROPFEMALE > Smith , but seeing as she's 10 , that might come off a < PROPMALE > bit creepy .... 
I am saddened by the fact that we have individuals , and teachers like < PROPFIRST > McDowell in our communities and instead of being praised for their strides for equality , they are punished ( or suspended ) for doing the right thing . 
I think it would be really interesting to attend a japanese smiling school .
