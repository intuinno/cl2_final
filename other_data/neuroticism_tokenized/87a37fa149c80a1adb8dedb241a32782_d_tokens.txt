It is an interesting biological fact that all of us have in our veins the exact same percentage of salt in our blood that exists in the ocean , and therefore , we have salt in our blood , in our sweat , in our tears . We are tied to the ocean . And when we go back to the sea --- whether it is to sail or to watch it --- we are going back from whence we came . - < PROPFIRST > F . Kennedy
