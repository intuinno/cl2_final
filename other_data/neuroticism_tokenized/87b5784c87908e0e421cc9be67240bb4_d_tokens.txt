I love it when I go to the mall and I pass by a piece of garment that my mom happens to find so cute and when she tells me about it one of the store clerks happens to comes by and tells me to try it on . I say no and keep insisting that its not my style when he keeps insisting that its everyones style and you can wear it on a date , at home , in the mall , grocery shopping and all I want is to get out of there :P !

Setting off an alarm at some house when I walk into it ........ nothing surprising there ^^ 
Dear my guitar , you have officially caused me pain with the practicing I do with you so now I have come to the conclusion that we will get no where with my skills and now I have a proposition for you . Do you want to just try again next year ?... Good , I'm glad we had this talk . 
..... Rice and chicken soup in a cup makes you want to just through it down the drain .... which I did :D Oh well I still ate healthy xD

Ok , just found out about the group called Gamer Chick/s on xbox . I can officially call that the stupidest thing I have ever heard of . 
Going to school at 1 tomorrow then staying home on Wednesday :D AMAZING ! 
I hate you people that have to come to my house to look at it , and go through my house and ruin my day of staying home because I have to get out of the house and go somewhere else for an hour and a half and not do anything . ANd not be picked up until another hour later for me to get back home just to do something else I don't want to do because my family is already home ....... conclusion ... I need a car . 
I'm super over obsessing over Umbrella Corporation and you know what that means ! Crazy ideas will be made up soon that will probably sound stupid to other people but I don't care . :P 
I'm bored and tired what to do ... oh I got it ... here I come xbox . 
Watching The Hills Have Eyes on my own will ...... my gosh , what is wrong with me D: I never watch scary movies >.< !

Going to Medieval Times today :D Only bad thing about it is that I had to get \all dressed up\ " . Ugh I guess it's worth it since I love that place :P " 
Everyone say I if I should dye my hair black :D ! ..... Kidding I'd < PROPFEMALE > do that ..... maybe a red though ? ^^ 
Staying home today from school to do my projects :D Fun Fun 
Day started ok , just a lot of different stuff going on my mind but by the end of the day felt a bit better , bus was hilarious and I took a button from a friend . Once I got home I plopped on my bed because I was extremely tired all day just tried not to show it :D I'm so ready for it to be summer . 
Went to bed at 12 last night , woke up 3 times during the night and woke up one last time to get up but my mom was yelling at me to get up and I thought she meant get up I'm late for school so I got up and hit my head on my beds header , then ran to my dresser but hit my toe really hard ..... then realizing that it's Saturday and she meant get up people are going to see the house . 2nd SHOWING ! 
Spent a few hours playing Ground War on MW2 , so yeah i'll probably go back for round two of awesomeness !

Gotta love those interesting stories that are told on the bus ride home :P 
Went to Kroger to get < PROPFEMALE > for one of my classes and popcorn , and while looking for < PROPFEMALE > i tried to get chocolates but found that each one of them were processed in a place with peanuts or had peanuts in them . So I just decided to settle for dum dums and skittles :D 
Bowling today , then crazy DDRness with my < PROPFEMALE > at the arcade at Brunswick , bruise on my arm ( don't know how I got that ) and and itchy bug bite on my neck :D Amazing Memorial Day .

:D Rain Won the Biggest Bad Ass Award for his movie Ninja Assassin :D I was so happy and screamy in my living room . I love you Rain . Oh oh and they had a System of A Down song playing in the background so it made it 10x more bad ass ^^ > ! 
Getting my own xbox soon :D No more having to borrow my brothers everysingle time he's at work . Hazaa ! I'll be kickn ass , shooting zombie brains , getting my friends pissed off , killing things with my bro at multi-player and oh yeah playing some Modern Wafare . 
All my life I had been wondering what triggered my eyes to change the color that it does from brown to green . It's mostly just a brown with a small small rim of green and I thought it was b/c of colors I wore or the lightness/darkness . But I finally figured out what triggered it . 
So I might have convinced my mom to get me a compound bow for one of my years in highschool :P Haha good thing I'm amazing at archery or else that bow would have no use in my possession :D But I won't shoot an animal and that's final ...... unless it's a stupid human ;) 
Watch out Sophmore year . You got a new girl < PROPFEMALE > coming right for you and going to punch you in the face .

Thinking , thinking , thinking . Had I ever told you that thinking was bad for me . You must have forgetten . Oh now it's just me hoping to forget you but not the memories . The memories are what drives me back to that place where I can fully trust you . Why ? 
Thought the last day I would sleep in my house was thursday night and leave friday morning but the realtor called and she said we need to be out of the house for good by thursday afternoon . I'm taking Wednesday and Thursday off now instead of Thur . and Fri . and I still have a lot of stuff to pack . Great !
