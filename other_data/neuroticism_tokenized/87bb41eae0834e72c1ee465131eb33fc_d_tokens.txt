Dealing with big problems like addiction to drugs or alcohol , depression , and so on , is like running from a pole while tied to it with a bungee cord . The harder you try the further you get , but it always pulls you back in . And the way to escape is to turn to a friend that knows and understands you . They can cut the cord and catch you from falling on your face . But how do you find a good friend when you are tied to a pole ? 
Every minute with you feels like an hour has gone by , but every minute without feels like a year has slipped away . 
\Why is it so hard to find someone\ 
My life may be black and white but I think of you in colors that don't exist . 
One should not be ashamed of what one has done . They should be ashamed of what they have not learned from what they have done wrong .
