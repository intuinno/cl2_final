i hate my life right now . my mom's to blame ... 
no words could ever describe the sorrow that has been living in my heart since the day i heard that my mother said that she has no daughter and that i am disowned just for defending my beliefs ... 
i just got back from a job interview ... i hope i get the job ! i really need the cash >_< 
ugh ... fatigue ... need sleep ... feel like throwing up ... 
i have insomnia again . wOOt ! ( sighs ) 
tired ... i'm gonna grab a cigarette then go to sleep . all-nighters are NOT fun ! :( 
i might move in w/ my dad in MD ... 
i feel like i'm here but yet not . it's like i can still feel what is pain and yet i can't . kind of like you're lost at sea . you try to figure a way out but the only way out is escaping into the recesses of your mind . my body's in autopilot & my mind is on its coffee break . i haven't been able to go out and enjoy myself like normal but then again , i enjoy the torture of my sanity slipping away slowly . 
i'm bored of job hunting !!! can't some random place just hire me already ?! 
first she's loving and caring . the next minute , she's insuting me ang degrading me . then , she calls me a monster that came out of her very womb ? is something wrong with this picture ? i cried myself to sleep last night wondering : am i really a monster ? am i so bad that my own mother rejects me ? 
i have a sore throat for my funeral preparation troubles ... no offense to Uncle < PROPMALE > but i'm glad we were able to make the funeral go w/o a hitch and get it over with . throat ... hurts ... 
my throat even worse than yesterday !!! dammit , i got the sniffles :( 
i'm looking for psych therapy places ! good for the noggin ^_^ 
i hate rain ... 
i'm so proud of myself . i just donated some canned food as a part of a food drive that the South County Building is having ^^ 
i got no sleep ... again !!! 
foood ... need food . rereading the 7th < PROPMALE > Potter book has made me hungry ... * stomach growl * 
i'm geared up to send a warning to a certain girl that keeps f***ing w/ my friend's bestie . hopefully , she doesn't play dumb . i haven't had a smoke in a while so she doesn't wanna cross me ... 
you ever had those days when you think you're dreaming but it turns out that you're too numb to acknowledge the truth ? you're just so wrapped up in that truth and the people around you only make it worse . to make things worse , the only time that you need your family's help , they back away from you as if you had the swine flu . it only fills you with apathy . this is one of those days . 
well , i've gone and done it again . i have a fricking cold !!! i worried myself sick for the first time :( 
i gots a new cell phone ! give me your number ? pleeeeease ? * pouts * 
HAPPY NEW YEAR'S!!! xD 
its not even the end of the first day of the new year & somehow I already managed to disfigure my face & get hurt . greaaaaaaaat :/ 
tired ... bored ... bad combo . 
i can't believe i signed up for morning classes at < PROPFEMALE > . what kind of cack was i smoking when i agreed to morning classes ?! i'm so sleepy ... even my pomegranate tea didn't help :( 
why do i feel like an ass after all i wanted was for her to be free to be with who she wanted to be with ? 
ugh , why is it that everytime i get a sore throat my mum also gets sick ??? 
wisdom teeth removal sucks ! my professor made fun of me for concealing my lower face with a scarf but it's better than the whole world seeing all the swelling and the bruising :( 
I'M ALMOST FULLY RECOVERED ! thank the goddess ! ^_^

i got a new job !!! i'm so happy ! ^_^ 
first i had to let my cat go last week , then i lost my bus card yesterday , my grades are going to shit and now i just lost my IT textbooks ... my day can not get any worse . 
listening to random music while working on my homework ... what more do i need ? 
just because a girl got raped and beaten in my neighborhood , doesn't mean that i'm going to have the same thing happen to me . why is it that when my parents always hear bad s *** they think that something will always happen to me ?! i don't talk to a lot of strangers on principle and it's not like i'm going to win Miss Universe anytime soon ... 
where to transfer , where to transfer ... gods , it's hard to figure out which school to go to with a < PROPMALE > like mine . before anyone asks , it's Hospitality/Restaurant Management .

i just found out today that the tea i drink in the mornings ( < PROPMALE > Grey tea ) not only has sufficient caffeine to wake your ass up in the morning , but it can also be used as a natural anti-depressant . no wonder i'm very positive a lot ! * strokes < PROPFEMALE > in thought *

the bus driver driving my bus home is fuckin ' psychotic . she's getting pissy just because people get up from their seats before she stops in front of the bus stop . i might as well learn to drive & buy a car because i'm tired of having to pay more bus fare as Metro's service gets crappier . paying for gas is worth not having to deal with imbeciles :/

what happens when you're afraid to let go ? do you die trying or give into your fear ? things can't stay like they are forever but what if this big gamble you attempt is too big even for you ? you ponder , reflect & you even cry about it . the question that remains , \will I regret my final choice ? \""

fucking insomnia . i take one nap and now i can't go to sleep ! rawr !!! > o < 
I felt so oddly energetic today , I kinda thought that I was acting like the Energizer < PROPFEMALE > on steroids they way I kept mixing drinks and cleaning the bar area at work like no tomorrow :P 
i finally found out that i was very caffeine tolerant today . instead of giving me a boost , it makes me sleepy no matter how i mix my coffee . what's funny is that coffee has always done that to me :P 
why is the line at this shop takin ' so long ??? I want my lunch ! * rawr ! * 
Please , oh please gods of wealth/money send me my W-2 so I can use my taxes to go back to school already & start cooking again ! >.<

Apparently they don't offer Harbour employee discounts for Katsucon . ugh , I wanted to go since I have that Saturday off ! fml :/ 
there's times in life where ya feel like you're made of ice . its that feeling of being apart from others , watching from afar , your insides feel kinda frozen up when you're confronted ( but your composure isn't lost ) , not giving a damn about what you tell others & just being simply too tired of give a damn . for the moment , I'm the < PROPFEMALE > of all things frozen . 
I finally got to eat what I've been craving forever ! my mum's stuffed green peppers ... * drool * 
good night < PROPFEMALE > ... -__- 
excluding some of the epic bus drivers i've gotten , i really hate how shitty the Metro system has gotten ...

i'm making a full recovery from my fever ( thank the gods ) . rested today just in case and i know i feel healthy if i'm screaming at < PROPFIRST > when he's doing stupid things again ;P 
Week 2 of my secret mission is becoming a bust thanks to work . I broke schedule due to the fact that I worked an all-day shift yesterday :/ 
I just met a nice lady on the bus . She proved to me that not all people on the Metro are bad & she even gave me driving tips :) 
Thanks for the happy birthday wishes y'all! I'm finally 20 today AND I have all weekend to celebrate it ! :D 
I'm going to < PROPFEMALE > Garden with the family for my birthday dinner :D 
my boobs got me stuck under the table at < PROPFEMALE > Garden just because my mum dropped her napkin . proof of how huge my cannons are :/ 
I just rode my bike over the < PROPMALE > Bridge in the rain . Cold ? Yup . Hungry ? Nope . Tired ? if ya mean from work then yeah . Are ya crazy ? Absolutely * nods * 
for once its nice outside ! now onward bus driver ! take me home so I can enjoy the few hours of daylight left -_- 
good night , y'all ... -__- * snore * 
You and I wake up in a psychiatric < PROPMALE > together . Using four words , what would you say to me ? \ 
Note : If you comment , you should copy and paste this to your status , so I may comment on yours as well ... four words is harder than you think . 
I just ran into the < PROPFIRST > Bieber movie with my bestie just to yell \Bieber SUCKS ! \ " real quick & run out . good times -_-" 
... is missing her laptop :'( 
have ya ever had one of those \OMFG ! WTF ?!? \ " moments after correctly predicting something you saw during a fortune telling session only a few days back ? " 
Why is it that the job I love morphed into a job I hate ? / Instead of feeling completion at night before I sleep , I just feel irate/ I know well that there can be more excitement from somewhere else in my life/ Such is this lowly barista's inner strife . 
My phone just deleted my contacts so if anyone has my number please text me yours !!! >.< 
Blessed Ostara :) 
I feel so low . I didn't find out until I had put a Black & Mild to my lips a half hour ago from all the stress I've been having that I unconsciously went cold turkey for a month and broke my no smoking streak :'( 
I just met a Spaniard at work and he was so cute ! His accent was to die for * squeal * my day has just been brightened ... >_< 
\You get angry when I ask what's on your mind 
bleh ! i'm sick again ?!? ugh , i'm SO gonna be bored today since i can't go to work ... -.- 
Except for the fact that I keep having coughing fits that make me look like I'm coughing up my lungs , I'd say I'm almost better -_-; 
Sometimes I wonder why I gave up fighting because when I observe stupidity anywhere nowadays , I have the urge to slap the stupid person silly and run . 
For the first time in awhile I'm getting more & more good news as this week goes . So good < PROPFEMALE > really does happen , I guess ^___^ 
I JUST GOT A PROMOTION !!! I'm officially the new night shift leader :D 
I am the happiest girl in the world ... things are going so well for me ! praise be to the gods that I am blessed with my cool family and a wonderful fiance :)
