Kids with special needs only want what everyone wants- to be accepted . Can I make a request ? Is anyone willing to post this and leave it on your status for at least 1 hour ? It is Special Education week , and this is in honor of all children made in a unique way . You never understand a situation until you are faced with it .

Well I went to Wallmart to get 1 gallon of milk . There was no 2% milk in the store . There were only 5 loafs of bread left . Geesh !!!! 1/2 the meats were gone most of the eggs were gone . People are stocking up for the ice storm ..... ARE YOU READY ? 
Had a great day with my grandkids . We cooked dinner together . Potato Soup and it turned out delicious .... No I didn't burn it ..... Potatoes , ham , onion , celery , carrots , garlic salt , flour and milk . Found it on google and it came out perfect . I did buy a rotisserie chicken just incase it didn't work out . It's still sitting in the frig . for another day .
