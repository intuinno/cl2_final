Theres always a friend who screws you over . a mistake that loses your trust . a girl who think shes everything . a bestfriend you cant live without . a boy that gives you butterflies . a lie that changes everything . a secret thats ment to be kept . a risk you wern`t suppose to take . a guy that gets you into trouble . someone you never stop thinking about . cant we just be ourselves ? everyones different nobody`s perfect !

1 of every 10 people born is gay . That means 1 of every 10 is instantly put down , given bad labels , left alone , put in minority and so much else , all for something they didn't ask for . Many gay teens are going to suicide as a way of escaping . If you want to tell them that life will ... get better and that you respect them for who they are , copy and paste this . Most of you wont , lets see the 5% of you who will .
