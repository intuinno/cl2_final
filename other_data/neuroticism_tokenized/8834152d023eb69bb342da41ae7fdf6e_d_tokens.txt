Today I had found a glass jar full of change at my old house , I have spent the last two and a half hours sitting in silence counting it all Quarters , Nickels , Dimes and Pennies .

Enjoy and beware , I'm doing this challenge now with Dr. Pepper and I am ODing on caffeine and being all giggly and slightly sick . Only about halfway through the movie , only halfway through a two liter . Good luck . 
If anyone expects me at school tomorrow , give up hope . I'm iced in . 
You and I wake up in jail together . Using only 4 words , what would you say to me ? Note : If you comment , you must copy and paste this to your status , so I may comment on yours as well . Be a good sport and play along .. and 4 words is hard to come up with . 
When you breathe kittens have carbon monoxide induced heart attacks that make them stand out in the rain to drown themselves like turkeys . 
I have an infestation of car dragons .... they make your car do those funny sounds that have nothing to do with anything , usually a slight rattling noise in your air vents . They feed off the crumbs of forgotten < PROPFEMALE > bars and snacks and can be quite annoying . Also , I've discovered that I do not enjoy it when my toilet paper says hi to me . 
-is dancing crazily- Eighteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen !! =D
