idgaf about the majority of anything . just thought I'd let you know . 
Now to prepare for the onslaught ... 
I feel bad that I have little to no concern for what people are saying to me about caring about me . I just don't have the energy to care about anything right now other than selfish things . I just need to get away from it all , I suppose . 
I REALLY don't want to go back to school .... 
Is there anyone that still needs my number ? 
I need a huge favor from someone . The only money I have is on a $50 Wal-Mart gift card due to some unfortunate events . Could anyone PLEASE trade me for some cash ? I really need the money for things like buying an outfit for senior breakfast and such . Keep in mind that I live alone and that I only have eight ones apart from the gift card .
