Next , my game I ordered on Amazon ( Deadlock : Planetary Conquest ) came in the mail today ( the expected arrival date was between Feb . 11 - Mar . 1 ) . Finally , < PROPMALE > and I both are just feeling better today ( which is the best one) ! 
wonders why the wall/ceiling in the apartment is leaking water . Time to get maintenence in here , if they even fix it . :P 
enjoyed playing an old favorite game of mine , but alas , I must retire . Until tomorrow , Deadlock . 
is filled with a sense of accomplishment . I fixed a chair and I talked to the office management here about the leaky wall/ceiling . What other things can I accomplish today ?! :D
