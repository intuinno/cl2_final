Have you ever watched something , or listened to a song , got inspired , then went to write something , and then realized you couldn't do anything with it because it's the same as what you were just watching/ listening to ? and it would be like plagarism ?... or is that just me ? X___x

I need a job ... Preferably something no one wants , that's super low profile , and that can be boring and tedious , but not too physical ... Is there such a thing ? Long hours are okay , I guess ...

via < PROPFIRST > Wiles : Post-Potter depression is a serious illness , that is not commonly recognised . Symptom's can include unwillingness to except the fact that the last movie came out , and repeatedly asking what the point to life now is . A lot of people I know will laugh at this . Please pass this on if you have , or know someone that has been affected by this tragic problem .

I'm a bad friend . Dx 
Who takes over an hour to do dishes !!!!!!!!!..................... oh wait , me . =____= 
I hate when you're trying to be mean to someone ... and they're to happy to understand that you ripped ' em a new one . =( .... HAhhahahahhaehehhehhh .... Oh , I'm awful . xDDD 
ever feel like you are stuck seeing out into a world that never sees you ? 
There's nothing more heartbreaking then not being able to help a friend in need ... \ 
I've had that happen to me so many times ... I was either too inexperienced , or ignorant ... two things I hate admitting to being . 
Change isnt so hard that you cant do it to save others . Everytime I watch news , I freak . What world are they in ? We are HUMANS before anything else , & I dont mean this to sound unpatriotic , but why do we hate eachother for what rock we live on ? Living across an ocean stereotypes me ? My thoughts got a little twisted , but basically , people act like a child having a tantrum . Relax , see what's really there , fix it . Freaking out , breaking things , & hurting others regaurdless of who they are is wrong 
Dx < I need HELP !!! Only what ? A month and a half or so before Halloween !?! I have no idea what to do . = < 
I love singing ... Isn't that weird ? I'm so bad at it . xDD\ 
=/ Haven't been able to do it since 7th grade ... 
COUSINS are the first friends most people ever have as children . No one will ever understand your crazy family like your cousin . Even if you haven't talked much lately ... RE-POST if you have the BEST cousins in the world !! I DO ! \ 
( Hillarious , I stole this from < PROPFIRST > on my cousin's birthday ! xD ) 
Anyone wake up crying before ??? It's not cool .... I'm not quite sure why it started , and I can hardly stop ... Freaking weird ... 
Feeling bad again ... Going to see if I can sleep it off . =___=

What do you people do on Facebook ??? \ 
I've probably payed almost every game or app . on here and I'm bored . =/ 
I am so weak ... Super man has Kryptonite ... I have shoes , jewelry , pens , pencils , < PROPMALE > supplies , and strangely , lip gloss . =____= 
Okay ... I am HORRIBLE at taking quizzes ... I have to wonder if I know myself at all . =__= 
I have to clean my room ... Anyone want to help ? xDDD 
Im probably one of the only people in the world who actually wants a smaller tv . xp 
First time I've actually felt confident about feeling ' okay ' in a long time ... I had to bawl like a baby for three days , but it was worth it . 
Ok , I didn't post this , but the other day , my mom and I went for some food ... While we were there I saw one of the most HORRIFIC things I have ever seen in my entire life ... A woman ... Smoking .... while ' SUPER ' Pregnant ... I felt devestated . 
Get ready for a crazy picture people ... I've been coloring it in for hours ! xD

=\\ took some interesting pictures of the makeup I did this morning ... Debating myself about posting . XD 
>=\\ Is anyone else tired of being nervous about speaking their minds ??? I dont want to hurt anyone's feelings , but I want to be able to be who I am without feeling ashamed , or that I should be more careful . That'll be my new resolution , I hope . Not being afraid to be me ... 
Every time I try to be happy , or avoid my life with books , movies , etc . ... tears always follow . I HATE being alone . 
Emotional rollercoaster kind of day ... I'm tired ... So , I think I'm going to bed ... 
Halloween is coming !!!! xDD\
