Thanks to everyone for my Happy Birthday wishes , we were in < PROPFEMALE > Beach all week so thats why it has taken me so long to say Thanks :) 
Hoping and praying Jacks surgery goes well tomorrow 
Jacks surgery could not of went better , now I just have to keep him from being too rambunctious and I have already had to remind him to calm himself ( and thats with the codeine ) . I guess I should just be thankful he is so resilient :) 
I retract my previous statement , poor < PROPFIRST > is in alot of pain and having trouble taking the Tylenol with codeine , for some reason I thought I would be able to go to work today , now I realize that was a really stupid assumption on my part . < PROPFIRST > is on the codeine now and as long as I do it every 4 hours on the < PROPFEMALE > it seems like he is coping . 
is having a really crappy week , < PROPFIRST > has the flu on top of just having his tonsils and adenoids out , < PROPFEMALE > is pulling at her ears , cannot breathe thru her nose and has a fever , and < PROPFIRST > just finished a round of antibiotics yesterday and feels worse than when he started them , hopefully I don't get sick or this ship will most likely sink :( 
Oh swine flu please go away 
is going to work today , yay for me and my wallet 
Is Thankful everything always seems to work out in the end
