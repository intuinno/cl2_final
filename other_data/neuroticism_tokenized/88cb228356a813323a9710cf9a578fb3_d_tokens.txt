the ninjas greatest down fall was armored units , the spartans will more than likely win sadlly . expecially since most ninjas relied on other ninjas for distractions . a 1 on 1 fight is a slaughter 
I wanna fly away searching for the answer\ 
I have noticed , that my faults and regrets have become wings\ 
Throughout my body I feel the wind and spread my arms \ 
I can fly away To the center of the sun , I could probably fly right now\ 
Escaping from the sad night , I can fly even further\ 
I can fly away 
< PROPFIRST > + No Sleep = Horrible things . I hold back most the things i want to say out of better judgment , no judgment = alot of unhappy people being told whats on my mind XD . 
10 people have declined to fight the appocolypse , guess they are just gonna sit back and take it . Lol i kid of course =P , the whole event is just a joke i wanna see how big it gets so feel free to decline , but if you wanna accept and help the number rise by all means do it =D 
I'm Old < PROPMALE > !!!! 
O.K. Tonight im going to say a bedtime story . \ 
There was once a cute little fish named Lillip . \ 
Lillip did not like his name so he wanted to go to the court office to get it legally changed , but every time hed try talking his owner , his owner would just stare and throw rotten food into his bowl for him to clean up ... i think they even wanted him to eat it . 
Eventually he got so mad that he started to yell , so fearcly infact bubbles came out , but still his owner did not listen and took it as him wanting more of the dispicable food . 
Soon the tank started to turn green from all of Lillips attempts at eating the substance . It was then that his owner put in a snail , a snail that called himself Hercly . 
The snail was mean to Lillip and beat him up when the owner wasnt there to watch . One day Lillip took things into his own hands and beat Hercly back , but unknown to Lillip snails dont do well being attacked and so Hercly died . Lillips owner was angry and called Lillip a bad fish , he then flushed them both . And they were never heard from again . \ 
The End . 
sorry guys it wouldnt let me do it all in one post 
Rawr .... im going to sleep ... zzzz , im gonna feel this late night in the early morning , thursday come quicker .. 
The soul is stronger than the body . \ 
When a person survives a near death experience , it means their soul was fighting to stay . \ 
To all of you who have had such events , take the time to ask that person what their reason was . \ 
And to those of you that havnt , make sure you let everyone you care for that you need them here , so that if something were to happen to them , they will always know what they are fighting for . 
Usually i dont do chain messages but curiousity has the better of me on this one . \

Courage is the ability to face your fears\ 
Bravery is the knowledge that something is dangerous , but you do it anyways for a greater cause . \ 
Stupidity , you know something is dangerous but you do it anyways for a few laughs and potentially 5 bucks depending on if your friend pays up . \ 
Idiocy- You thought it was a good idea all along . \

The mouth is silent when it comes to how you truly feel , if only those around you could hear what your soul is screaming , perhaps then you would find happiness . 
NOOO WORK TOMMOROWWW !!! YESSSS !!!! 
Good Night all , Going to sleep a bit early compared to usual , but hell ive been runnin off of like , 4 hours of sleep all day . So , enjoy the rest of your nights , and i shall speak to the elite few of you in the morning . 
My mind is my own , those who try to change it better have proof of why it should change , to try and force a mind to change is to actually force a mind to \play along\ " and will eventually lead to betrayal . " 
Double sided razorblades , convienent , but risky .. OW MY NOSE !!! but all i wanted to do was shave my lip =(

anybody else's adobe flash keep repeatedly crashing ? Ive virus scanned 4 times with 2 diffrent programs and found nothing , so i know its not a virus . But it keeps making me reinstall it ... 
People are foolish , they aspire for that which they can't obtain , \ 
Take that which others worked so hard to earn , \ 
Give only the things which they wouldn't feel loss over , \ 
And save only the feelings that cause anger , \ 
We eat that which we dont need to and say we wish we could help the starving , \ 
We kill that which doesn't need to die because it anoys us , \ 
In short , we suck . =P 
The Connecticut DMV = Garbage\ 
They are just completely freakin retarded .

failure is not an option , its just the end result XD 
You know whats stupid , when you send out all these little wall posts saying you need something , and then everybody just gifts you something else . =\\ i dunno , gifts are nice , but the wrong gifts are useless , but if they arnt paying attention , i cant even say there was a thought to count . 
I am taking care of a Newborn kitten . I am unable to leave the house for any longer than 4-5 hours ( no more than 2 is ideal as i must feed it every 2 hours , however i have a 4-5 hour work day so that cant be helpe ) So , to answer future question .

Oh happy day ! The lab results for my infection came back positive for mersa ! =DD 
MRSA is often confused with a spider bite in appearance . Common symptoms and signs of this infection can include a single red bump that resembles a pimple , pustule , or boil . It may also look like a cluster of red bumps . The involved site may also be red , swollen , warm , painful , and have pus or other drainage . \ 
hahaha , oh yes , the description does fit .
