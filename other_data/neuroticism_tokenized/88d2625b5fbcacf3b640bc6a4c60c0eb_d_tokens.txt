Steam is being dumb . If I try to play an already-downloaded game while it downloads another , the current download stops . Don't know why .

What is up with this virus ? Normally , you get a cold and are sick for a day at most . I've been sick since Saturday . Sis thucks .

my brother meant to say five o'clock shadow . He said twelve o'clock shower . <.< 
joined Gaia ... immediately I found an exploit : It gives you gold for browsing ... I wrote an Automator application that constantly switches between Gaia pages . Even as I post this Safari is running in the background , controlled by Automater and earning me gold :P 
got too cocky with my Gaia bot . It was caught by flood control when set to 2 seconds between each refresh . I'll set up a program to randomly visit links , and have a waiting time of 4 seconds . 
Hm ... Gaia ...

Batman Begins was good . On to Dark Knight ! -- My foot has my laid up . All I'm going to be able to do tonight is watch movies . >:( 
Abstract the world ; there is no reason for you to believe it exists . Deny yourself emotions ; the most intense of these will only hinder what little difference you'll make in your mentally-constructed fantasy world . What gives you the right to determine what is the truth and what is an illusion ? 
just got a cell phone ! With my Samsung Trance , I've now full entered the 21st Century . 
Update status : posting from my new cell phone ! 
if you keep sending messages to someone when they ask you to stop , is it textual harrassment ?

Just won top ten recognition award for web design fundamentals ! 
Went swimming in the Pacific yesterday . Had a scare when my four-year-old brother went missing . Eventually we found him with a life guard . He was alright . 
Just got steam for < PROPMALE > ... Unfortunately there's only a few titles converted to play on < PROPMALE > so far ... Good news is that Steam Play allows me to play previously purchased games that have been ported . Performance in those games is horrible though . I haven't tried < PROPMALE > Portal yet . 
why is it that 4Kids uses the same ten voice actors for every series they ever produce ? 
which geometrical shape has an orthocenter = $ 100,000 question on millionaire ? really ?!?

Love how ever action movie director thinks that the Wilhelm Scream will improve the movie ... yeah , ' cause it totally doesn't ruin the immersion . 
So ... Any thoughts on this ' Goldeneye 2010' ? \ 
I don't think any company will ever beat Rare's masterpiece , but we'll see ... 
Dude if you have Steam get on there nao !!!!!! HUGE deals in like EVERY category ! 
He sewed his eyes shut because he is afraid to see\ 
He tries to tell me what i put inside of me

anybody see itunes 10 ? Honestly I'd LIKE to believe that not everyone at apple is a complete idiot . Then they come out with the changes to the UI in iTunes 10 . THEY BROKE THEIR OWN FRIGGIN ' HUMAN INTERFACE GUIDELINES ! 
When there is no emotion , there is clarity . 
At apple < PROPFIRST > orchard . There are afro chickens here . 
Expose yourself to simulations of traumatic events in order to desensitize yourself , so that if such events actually happen to you , you will be as emotionless as possible , and able to make logical decisions . 
Intimate relationships are a liability . No simulation can prepare you for a significant other's death , betrayal , or breakup . 
Well . 
You remember how Viacom wanted YouTube to hand over usage data on ALL USERS ? You remember how Viacom wants to take YouTube off of the internet ? < PROPMALE > S . 3804 , aka the Combating Online Infringements and Copyrights Act ( COICA ) will make it possible to prove that YouTube is illegal , and allow the government to SHUT DOWN YOUTUBE . Guess who's backing it ? 
\There are already laws and procedures in place for taking down sites that violate the law . [ COICA ] would allow the Attorney General to censor sites even when no court has found they have infringed copyright or any other law\ " -EFF " 
Been working on a PHP project for 1.5 solid days . Time to take a small break . 
PHP , XHTML , CSS , JavaScript , Java , ActionScript , Python , and C . 
It's impossible to argue that Apple is worse than Microsoft . Microsoft has not yet had opportunities to ban open-source software from a mass app market . If given the < PROPMALE > , they would too . It's all about the money in the end . 
Swelling in thumb starting to go down . I must be the first person in local history to sustain injury due to lightsaber combat . 
Why does the porridge bird lay its eggs in the air ? 
Snow . That is all . 
Why didn't Naboo just jam the signal coming from the droid control ship ? 
Blade Kitten is strangely addictive . It's been awhile since I've played a platformer . 
Bad news for PHP : my internet is down and cant be fixed until friday 
never mind , internet fixed . 
people are not basically good ... on the other hand no one is basically evil ... rather , a man in his right mind will try to do good , but one man's good is another man's evil due to the subjective nature of morals . 
The reasoning man must reject religion as any premise . He cannot predict what happens after death , as this is as much outside of the limits of reason as religion . He can , however , make a strong inductive argument that death is inevitable . \ 
How much this man must wish that he could be ignorant again ! But what has been seen cannot be unseen . 
IS the cake a lie ? Some say it isn't . I think they just wish it were real . 
I'm kind of bored and I wanna debate . So ... what is YOUR problem with furries ? 
Furries are normal people .

sometimes it seems like `npc kill all` is a viable option .

WHAT FACEBOOK IN GARRY'S MOD !?!? 
Yay , watching musical < PROPFIRST > from My Fair Lady ! 
Introducing the New Profile : We here at Facebook just love sharing , and now we've made it even easier to share as much personal data as possible ! No longer will people have to click through your profile to see personal information : It's all on the front of your profile < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Bored . I think I'll program some < PROPFEMALE > . 
I just love Steam holiday deals ! 
Logic doesn't always permit the favorable resolution of cognitive dissonance . 
Dang . Programming < PROPFEMALE > makes it hard to think ! 
Q : You're in the grocery store with a broken cart . How will you ever be that hungry ? \ 
A : It has nothing to do with my hunger . I was just minding my business , shopping with a perfectly good cart , when all of a sudden , a strange ninja dressed in a purple scarf leaped from the ceiling , pulled out his standard-issue rubber ball , and used it to melt the side of the cart , causing the lasers on the cart to misfire . 
Very soon I will have created a program that makes logic connections ! I feel like a mad scientist ! 
Is it a superconcept or a property ? I DON'T KNOW ! 
Trying to find a good name for my < PROPFEMALE > program . Any suggestions ? 
lol , reading a webcomic from ' 01 : character in it brags about his comp's 40 gig HD . 
It makes me feel awesome to have Halcyon say stuff such as ' < PROPFEMALE > core memory saved to disk ' 
I look back on some of the things that used to make me laugh and I realize that I just don't care anymore . ... ... ... ... ... ... 
What can a programmer do to express himself ? I'm not a visual artist , I can't write , and I don't sing . The best I got is some cheap Photoshop effects . Curse this left-brainedness . 
Just got done watching GITS and GITS 2 for English . Love those movies . 
finally done with that stupid homework ... I hate CPW ...
