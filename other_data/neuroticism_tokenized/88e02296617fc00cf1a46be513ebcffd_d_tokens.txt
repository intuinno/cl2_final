Paper , reading homework , Kingdom Hearts 2 , being back on facebook . 

Defequé en el refrigerador y me comí toda la rueda de queso . 
Generic Facebook Status Update . 
Sure would be nice if < PROPMALE > Hall had dryers that did what they were supposed to do . 
I finally finished watching all 28 Toho Godzilla movies ! I finally know who/what Kiryu is . I don't expect anyone else to know , though . :( 
: Facebook ! Just when you thought < PROPMALE > would never come back to Facebook . He does ! Dun-dun-dun ! 
I wish there was such a thing as a MXT ( Medium Extra Tall ) shirt . 
What's that ? Godzilla 90s is back ?!?!? 
Overnight field trip to see prairie chickens tomorrow . I can't say I'm overly excited . Being in a < PROPFEMALE > bird blind for 3 - 4 hours ..... 
Almost finished watching all of Dragonball . Dragonball Z is up next . All this to understand Epic Tier characters . Meh . 
Going to see Iron Man 2 in less than an hour . 
Comcast is playing shenanigans again . My email has stopped working for the nth time . They really need to do something about that . 
Sparky Sparky Boom Man ! He's pretty badass . Gotta admit . 
I'm finally actively reading a book ... but it's one I first read way back in middle school : Magic Kingdom For Sale SOLD ! by < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . 
The Other Guys is an AWESOME movie ! I honestly think that in terms of all around funniness it rivals Anchorman ! 
Damn it . Pendulum is so good . 
I can't believe having a mosque near ground zero is even a topic of discussion . 
How epic would it be to hear some guy on a banjo play Dragonforce with the correct tempo ? 
Nice going , < PROPMALE > . My high school is finally on TV and you haven't set up ESPNU on your DirecTV yet . 
According to speedtest.net and not using internet for anything else , I am getting a download speed of 0.03 Mbps . That's 30 times slower than normal for < PROPMALE > internet . 
Even though I came back with some scrapes , sore muscles and a possibly twisted ankle I thoroughly enjoyed tonight's Playground Games . 
shake hand , kiss baby , shake hand , kiss baby , kiss hand , shake baby , kiss hand , shake baby 
Mr. < PROPMALE > talked to his cat . Mr. < PROPMALE > talked . Mr. < PROPMALE > was lonely . Mr. < PROPMALE > was . Mr. < PROPMALE > is the subject of the sentence and what the predicate says he does . 
Something's tearing me down and down . Can't help but feel it's coming from you . She's a gunshot bride with a trigger cries . I just wonder what we've gotten ourselves into . In a trail of fire , I know we will be free again . In the end we will be one . In a trail of fire , I'll burn before you bury me . Set your sights for the sun . 
Starting to get the nearing-bedtime silliness ... I'ma go now . 
You can hide your eyes . You can dim the lights , but they are watching . This is a new time with a different kind . They are the future ; the only one . This is the final call for the setting song as they get closer . And with full blown grace , thy will be done ; the show is over . Its a new < PROPFEMALE > ! 
So I started a download for the Knox's Armory DLC for Borderlands last night at 9pm ........ 22 hours later it's only at 40% . 
Visit again white elephant . Who sent you to loom ? Shall we sever everything ? Ponder this while we ponder why . He's starting to follow crows , and climbing the ladder somewhere out to really begin to scare , and plotting to comb the grounds with a fine tooth . 
One of these days I wish basically every dream I've had for the past 13 years came true ; I wish I could fly . 
What took < PROPMALE > Guest 22 hours , < PROPMALE > ethernet doubled in only 3 . 
had a cool dream this morning . Very detailed . 
Tomorrow , Wednesday , Oct . 20th , wear purple in memory of the 7 teen suicides related to homophobic bullying in the recent weeks . If you see this and are going to participate , please post this as your status so you and other people don't forget . 
I'm ready for this tectonics final . 
Man ! I am soooo modest ! God , I must be the most modest person in the world ! No the universe ! I can't believe how modest I am . Jeez ! 
What if I want to marry my washcloth ? 
Ha ! Momentary power outage at < PROPMALE > . 
Eiiiiiiyaaah ! Jackieeeeee !!! 
I gotsta see Tron Legacy ! December 17 ! Daft Punk ( according to a Facebook ad) ! 
So many thank yous ........ it gets repetitive . Still , it's good to respond , right ? 
( should have done this first ) Attention all people — or at least the ones that wished me a happy birthday — thank you ! 
It's BROTHER'S WEEK ... if you have a brother who has made you laugh , punched you , stuck up for you , drove you crazy , hugged you , watched you succeed , saw you fail , picked you back up , cheered you on , made you strong , someone you can't do without , copy and paste this to your status . For < PROPFIRST > , the guy who calls me ' fat kid ' frequently and gives me throat hugs on occasion . 
I have a conundrum . I can't decide which is better : sleep or water ..... This is going to bother me for awhile . 
For lack of a Facebook < PROPFEMALE > , I will put it as my status : I actually rate all of my iTunes music . And I have roughly 100 smart playlists . Good times . 
So much chemistry homework ...... 
The dodgeball chancellor's an extremely personal friend of mine . I helped him shed some unwanted poundage before beach season . 
Netflix fails . 
I usually don't post these sorts of things on FB , but in light of my recent FB activity and its importance I feel I must say something : My immediate family and I are going through pet loss ..... two of my family's four cats have very recently passed away ...... (( non-uncomfortable FB status ending )) 
Chummy ........... rest in peace ...... :( 
Visit again white elephant . 
onomatopoeia = vowel diarrhea 
working on a paper that I should have started a while ago ... but that's now how I write papers . * shrug * 
Just discovered that \geologize\ " is a legit word . It's in the Oxford American Dictionary so you know it's good . " 
I love how < PROPMALE > cable gets so many commercials for shows on channels 200+ ... when our highest channel is 60-something . 
Fistandantilus !!!!! 
Comcast mail fails again 
RIP .... Monkey . Belated , but I when it occurred I didn't want to post it on FB . 
all email and means of communication are down for < PROPMALE > right now . No idea how or why . 
I have to use the campus guest account because the main one is not worth shit . 
16 missed messages , because < PROPMALE > college can't figure out how to fix their internet . 
Glad to be almost done with Chemistry 121 , which turned out to be the hardest easy class I've ever taken . 
740 MB < PROPMALE > Update ? About 3 hours ?? Fine ... 
Great song : The Beginning Of The End by Nobuhiko Morino on the Godzilla Final Wars Soundtrack . Gets me every time . 
feeling groggy , but mellow 
Autopilot Off . Enough said . 
< PROPFIRST > Caliendo is fuuunny . I just watched his special on Netflix . Laughs were had . 
just watched a special on leopards on pbs . reminds me of good times . 
Holy crap , I got an A- in my surprisingly hard intro chemistry class . Was not expecting that . 
Ha . The Listerine commercial is encouraging an inefficient method of mouth-washing . 
Just watched Relative Strangers ( 2006 ) . This is why you say what is on your mind when it is on your mind . Problems like this movie's problems are prevented long before the anger builds up . Why sugarcoat anything ? 
\Everything could change on a new year's day . \ " Also I will not miss < PROPMALE > internet this Thanksgiving break . " 
IS AT HOOOOOOOOOOOME !!! My cat was happy to see me . Also , [ additional observation ] . 
\And when you're a professional pirate -\" \"- you don't have to wear a suit . \"" 
So ... my highschool is the state champion for football again . 
the one thing I miss most right now that I had while still at home : good orange juice . I'll have to stop by < PROPFIRST>'s sometime soon . 
So I don't know about anyone else , but I really thought the music on the OC at lunch was cool . Does anyone know what that style of music is called ? I want some ! 
Why , Dr. Pepper , why ? Why are you so good ?! 
is sick . I'll spare you all the details , but ... meh . Will not impact class though . Oh , facebook , why have you killed the need for complete sentences ? Pronouns ! Subjects ! Bah . 
Current book I'm reading : The Legend of Huma by < PROPFIRST > Knaak . 
as far as empathy is concerned , I am in the 0.8 th percentile . 99.2% of people are more empathetic than me . I agree . 
The boost mobile commercial speaks to me . I do know how it is to be a giant ..... but how the hell is he using that < PROPFEMALE > phone with such giant fingers ? 
why , guy from Subway commercial ? why do you ALWAYS fall for the girl's trick ? every time ! you'd think you'd learn . 
Change your profile picture to a cartoon from your childhood . Invite your friends to do the same . Purpose ? An invasion of childhood memories . The goal is not to see a human face on Facebook until Monday . ( THIS IS FOR THE FIGHT AGAINST CHILD ABUSE !! ) PLEASE REPOST AND PARTICIPATE :) 
I LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE MUSIC !!!!! * interjection relating this feeling * 
I just can't get enough Autopilot Off . 
\Respect . Pass it on . \ " How does one pass on an intangible object ? " 
Not sure how I feel about FB posts I've made being partially shown on my wall . 
< PROPMALE > internet is getting slower and slower ........ hooray for blizzard season . 
Does anyone have a bottle opener ? < PROPFIRST > Dowdy gave me a ( probably ) awesome Dr. Pepper bottle , but I can't open it ....... frustration . 
lots of spinning wheels of death lately ........ especially using Safari . 
Achilles badassus est . 
So I just had this random idea ( these are actually very common but I rarely ever remember them long enough to share them with anyone ) . \ 
\ 
What would you do if you were suddenly told by someone that you had complete command over about 20 supersoldiers ? \ 
Personally , I have no idea what I'd do with them . I don't really have any enemies so I wouldn't use them for revenge .... just curious what others will say .... 
so does Netflix just fail or is it < PROPMALE > internet that is so terrible ? \ 
5 times it came up with a message that said \Your internet connection has slowed . We are adjusting playback to avoid further interruption . \"" 
early bed so's I can do some last minute packing in the morning . g'night , < PROPMALE > . 
zetaboards is acting weirdly ........ or maybe it's just crappy Comcast internet not knowing what the f *** it's doing . It's soooo fast , but it's even more unreliable than < PROPMALE > internet . pathetic . 
So here I am in my basement watching my brother play Just Cause 2 . It just may be the most ridiculous game ever . < PROPFIRST > Bay would love it . 
I finally saw the Mortal Kombat movie . All in all , pretty decent for a 1995 film . If it were done today the effects would be waaaaay cooler , but still . I enjoyed it . 
\What a digital dummy . \"" 
\I think a dime went up my nose . \"" 
\5643 . Yeah right . \"" 
So apparently < PROPMALE > primary internet is down until 5pm tonight . I'm sooooooo glad I'm at home . Crap internet followed by none ? Also Christmas was great . I got an amazon kindle ( case included ) , some cool hand fidgets , Step Brothers ( from my brother ) , a new coat , some new mechanical pencils and more . Good times . 
so apparently the wheaton animal clinic determined that what the Naperville animal shelter thought was a \he\ " is actually a \ " she \"." 
So I'm back at < PROPMALE > ready to start Ethics ... for lack of a more major/minor-worthy class . Eh , at least it meets only in the afternoons . 
After schoolwork et cetera , I have moved on to watching the old Godzilla series ( the one with G . I . N . O . ) on Netflix as well as Teen Titans on gogoanime.com . 
awkward discussion in class today . Bertrand < PROPFIRST > and his sexual morality theory . meh . 
Say I hypothetically get food-poisoning from an undercooked Sodexo hamburger . Am I allowed/entitled/encouraged to < PROPFEMALE > my college or otherwise alleviate the financial burden ? Just curious is all . 
I feel so ashamed of myself . My concept of the NBA is 13 years out of date . Thanks a lot < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > and almost everyone else who was good on the Bulls . 
Nothing like a foot cramp to wake you up from a nap . 
I can't decide whether or not to post that post/like/comment/message thingy .... 
Showdown by Pendulum . 
Another even more awkward ( for me ) discussion in my Ethics class . Meh . 
strangely enough the animal rights discussion in class today did not make me anywhere near as uncomfortable as the past two class discussions . Hmm . 
I wish more people knew about Autopilot Off . Maybe then the band would decide to make some more albums . 
The paper towel dispenser in my dorm just bit me . Nobody makes me bleed my own blood . Nobody ! 
My roommate just turned on the TV and I thought I saw liopleurodons ...... you can imagine my disappoint when I realized they were merely humpback whales . 
Does anyone know if < PROPFIRST > Bay was involved in Mighty Morphin ' Power Rangers ? 
The < PROPFIRST>'s Crab Shack commercial where the giant crab claw lands in the house reminds me of Ebirah . Sadly , no one will know what this means without looking it up . 
Let the FaceTime force-user war begin ! 
Several of my characters are getting annoyed by my constant \what would [ this character ] do in this situation ? \ " thoughts . " 
Today I worked out for the first time since high school gym . Granted I only \ran\ " about a mile on an elliptical but it's a start . I think I'm going to make it a part of my schedule . " 
I wish I could find people to discuss my stories/characters/ideas . Just the ( seemingly ) simple concept of laughing about a recent plot event appeals to me to no end . It would also be cool to compare and contrast between my own creations and other people's creations . Sigh . 
down in the dumps . Reasons are unclear . One is probably the time of year . Psh . I made a rhyme . 
Ashes In The Fall by Rage Against The Machine 
solitary confinement does not work on Creators . 
Be at Wordsmiths tonight . You know who you are . 
I find myself caught between two powerful forces : my own naturally elevated self-confidence and my self-imposed depression caused by a new but strengthening sense of loneliness ...................... wow , awfully deep for a status post . 
1.94 < PROPMALE > today on the elliptical . I hardly broke a sweat . Although it's probably too early to say that my cardiovascular endurance has increased . Meh . 
Ha . It's so much easier to see with my glasses on . Ha . After-nap drowsiness . 
How hard is it for Sodexo to put a noticeable amount of pizza sauce on their so-called pizzas ? Honestly it's like I'm eating cheese bread with some meat added on . 
The 12th Day by Autopilot Off 
Out in the night , the cicadas sing their song . 
I've actually been curious about this otherwise I would not post it . How many of my fb friends remember when they first met me . My poor memory prevents me from knowing for sure , probably , but I'm curious if what I do remember is accurate . You don't have to make a similar fb status thing because I was even hesitant to post this . 
I finished my focus question for Monday but I have not yet chosen a final paper topic . None of the specific topics involve Kant , whom I find as my favorite philosopher out of the basic ones that we discussed . 
Neodämmerung by < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > 
Seriously , Batman , get a voice changer . How much does a guy have to hate his voice to do what you do ? 
The Trainman Cometh by < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > 
2 things . I learned that \functional\ " sounds a < PROPFEMALE > bit like \ " fuck shit up\ " if it's slurred enough . Also I ran 2.38 < PROPMALE > on the elliptical today . " 
Lack of any more class in this block is a < PROPMALE > downside I think . I no longer have the motivation of getting my final paper done .... But it's so easy to procrastinate on Facebook . I've become one of them . 
So maybe there are times when rushing a final paper is a bad idea ..... that hurt to write and I think I could have done a lot better . Oh well , you learn from your mistakes , not your successes , right ? At least I'm on block break now . 
And suddenly I miss my cat Sport . A lot . 
Not looking forward to working at 6am tomorrow . 
Listening to Pandora radio until I feel like getting ready for bed . I suppose the music genre I'm listening to now could be called \hardcore techno \"." 
Merner fire alarm . 
Agrabah synthase . A worldbuilding enzyme . 
__Shows_I_am_currently_watching__\ 
Netflix : Doctor Who Season 2 , Psych Season 1 , Godzilla ( G . I . N . O . )\ 
Other : < PROPFEMALE > Tail , One Piece , Bleach , Dragonball Z Abridged , Yugioh Abridged , Whose Line Is It Anyway 
Attention < PROPMALE > . Where is a good place to use my laptop that doesn't completely isolate myself from the rest of campus ? I'm looking for a place that I could socialize if I chose to , but where I could still work on stuff without being constantly brought into other conversations . I'm trying to expand my comfort zone . 
my roommate doesn't think there is anything easier done than said . I think he's wrong . 
The plural of Prius is Prii , obviously . 
Whenever I hear \werewolf\ " I think \ " There wolf ; there castle \"." 
Aaaaaaaaaaaand bedtime . Or at least that's what my eyes are begging me . 
The Northgoing Zax and the Southgoing Zax eventually would have stopped forever anyway because there comes a time when you can't go north anymore ( the north pole ) and same with the south pole . They should have been the Eastgoing Zax and the Westgoing Zax . It would make more sense . 
Does anyone know an efficient way of putting on a scarf ? 
Also , for all those that I told the fahrenheit and celsius values overlap at -44° I was wrong . That value is -40° . 
My roommate says he just saw a lightning flash ..... thunder snow ? 
Ha . I have zero focus at the moment . 
Frustrated that I cannot formulate the thoughts going through my head into words . If only thoughts could be transferred directly instead of using language as a middle step . 
Gah ! I love Pendulum ! 
Callior Melior Citior Fortior 
Watercolour by Pendulum ! 
\How can the rainbow collapse ? \ " ~ Random Sentence Generator " 
My characters are so patient with me . Their only source of animation is me and yet they aren't nagging me to write about them . But is it a sign that they're patient or that I annoy them ? 
I do not envy the people who live below me . All my heel-stomping to Pendulum's epic Drum & Bass music . My newest favorite : Watercolour . 
You know what's frustrating ? Writing thousands of words in a group internet story and then not being able to take about it with anyone except those few writers involved in the group internet story . 
**** yeah , I love Dr Pepper ! 
You know , a < PROPMALE > on my life would be really nice . Like for example whether I know what a relationship is/if I actually want to be in one/if I am ready to be in one/know what to say if any of these answers are yes . 
I keep having this recurring fear that I keep disproving that life after college will be very lonely . At the very least I'll have facebook so I'll still be in the loop . Bah , another deep status message . 
I saw Tron Legacy . Now I want Daft Punk's new album . 
Who has original characters they created ? I really want to know . 
Damn it , Blackbeard . Unless Enel and the other logia-type-users team up .... it's hopeless . 
Attack of the Rathjaergn ! ~ Possible Future Plotline for COH 
Writer's Workshop is good . Zzrdzmzthz ( Wordsmiths ) and < PROPMALE > College Wordsmiths people should look into it if they have not already . 
People who read this status message and are involved in Zzrdzmzthz ( Wordsmiths ) and/or < PROPMALE > College Wordsmiths should come to the meeting tomorrow night at 8pm in Athens . If you can . Please ? 
The main character of one of my newest series scares me . A lot . Something about the possibility of reality-manipulation just doesn't sit right . 
WORDSMITHS TONIGHT !!!!!!!! BE THERE !!!!! 
Apparently Autopilot Off made an album other than Make a Sound . I must get it . 
< PROPFIRST > Shakespeare , the First Wordsmith . ~ Paraphrase of Doctor Who \The Shakespeare Code \"" 
my squeaky chair is amusing me a little too much right now . I think it's time I go to bed . 
I sort of shut down in the C&G Date Auction . Awkward concept , no interest in actually going to it , surprised by the motion for recess being the date auction , other lame introvert explanations . 
Anyone up for seeing Step Brothers at some point ? I have the DVD , want to see it again and would rather see it with other people . Eh ? 
Come to ADOPT-A-CHARACTER DAY on the Orange Carpet now ! I made 26 characters for it . 
Dude ! It's 5pm and it's still < PROPFEMALE > outside . 
I find the name \ Mr. Chuckles\ " far too humorous than I should . " 
What is this 30 days thing ? 
Pandora + Latin Homework 
I've switched my main internet browser from Safari to Firefox . I was annoyed by all the force quits I had been doing . Also , it's about 5pm and it's very bright outside .....?
