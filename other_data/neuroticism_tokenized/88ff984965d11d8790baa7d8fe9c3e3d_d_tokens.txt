your experience will always conform to your expectations ; this is how things like the \Laws Of Attraction\ " work . " 
you can not control the actions of others , no matter how much you would like to . You are best to stop taking things so personally , and understand that sometimes other people's issues are theirs and not yours .

What you need to be most careful about is falling prey to being envious of those who have what you don't , rather than being grateful for what you do have , and what sustains you .
