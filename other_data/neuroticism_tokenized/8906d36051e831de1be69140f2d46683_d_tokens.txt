Kidney infection .. Yay :/ Got my first shot in ten years . I didn't enjoy it . 
Hmm . I just love attempting to solve my friend's problems at 1 am . Stubborn people ... You wear me out ! 
I am sooo over staying home sick . I'd love to just enjoy my last week of summer break like everyone else .. But nooooo ... I can't do that because my kidney is being extremely rude to me ! 
< PROPFEMALE > 122 out of 455 . About a week to finish . I don't know if I can accomplish that .. 
Why does Grapes of Wrath have to be the never-ending novel of doom ? IT JUST KEEPS GOING !!! -___- 
At my house with < PROPFEMALE > Nierman being bored . Looking for something to do . Any ideas ? 
170 pages to go and one day to get it done . I'm so sick of English Honors and it hasn't even started yet .. 
How about we just all dont show up to school tomorrow ? Yeah ? Okay cool . 
High school ... is a terrible place .. Homework .. is a terrible thing .. And waking up early .. ruins your whole day . Welcome back to school everyone . -__- 
Why is it that most guys can't be trusted ? 
Sleepover with Sami Ribaudo <3 :) 
Isn't it great to be ignored when you're worried about something ? I think not 
I had a dream last night that my dad and I went to Mexico and I had to talk to some dude in Spanish(which I'm bad at ) and then in the end ... he knew English . -__- 
I hate when people stop being your friend because of something that isn't your fault . 
I need a word in Spanish that starts with a W . It's supposed to somewhat describe me . HELPP ! 
On the phone with < PROPFEMALE > talking about our daily drama . Hahaha <3 
Quizzes tomorrow : Bio . World History . Geometry . Since when is Thursday quiz day ? What happened to Fridayyy ??? 
Summer just spit on my hand .... On purpose .. Oh yeah , I'm totally gonna miss her when she goes to UCLA . 
Does anyone have world history honors with < PROPFIRST > ?????? My computers wont let me get the stupid papers for the thing tomorrow . 
Two words . Fuck . School . 
Freakin compass for geometry just stabbed me in the arm and I'm bleeding :'( Math is dangerous ... 
Why do I tend to get myself into bad situations ? :( 
I know I think things through a lot , but damn ! Summer thinks about every little thing . 
Okay so for world history honors I have to read the rest of this chapter , which is 20 pages . But I recently realized that even if I read it , I won't remember one single thing . Should I even bother reading it ..? 
Some guys are really stupid . I hate when you think someone is your friend and then they stab you in the back . This is the second guy who's done this to me this year . WTF ! 
Wow I'm such an idiot hahaha 
P-R-O-C-R-A-S-T-I-N-A-T-I-O-N :) The 15 letters that sum up my life . 
I miss my sister already . She just left today . She should come back . Screw college . :/ 
Doctors appointment yet again ... I hope it goes well this time . 
On the phone with my sister :) \Like freakin ' Big Bang Theory status dinosaurs ... \"" 
\I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain . It's 2 am and I'm cursing your name . So in love that you acted insane . And that's the way I loved you . \ " < PROPFIRST > Swift gets me . Haha . " 
< PROPFEMALE>'s mom & stepdad are Facebook stalkers ! 
< PROPFIRST > Armstrong is a meany face and I don't like him . :( <3 Just keedingg . But he does suck for ditching me on our webcam chat thing . Hahaha . 
I wanna watch E.t. in theaters right now . How should I go about this ? Hahaha 
I did my world history homework on my own for the first time , on the last day I'll be in the class hopefully . :) 
I used to lie to my parents all the time to get away with things . I'm so over it . It's annoying to constantly worry about getting caught . That doesn't mean I'll stop though .. Hahaha . 
This is pretty much the weirdest bar graph we've ever made .... < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Nierman 
I got dress coded . My phone broke . And it was super hot . Not the best day . 
Okay , so .. I broke my phone . I have a temporary one , but I lost everyone's < PROPFIRST > . Gimme Gimme . :) 
So today me and < PROPFEMALE > went to the nail salon . I took my backpack with me so I could go home after . I left my backpack there .... and they closed right after . They don't open til 9 . Fml . 
Don't you just love when you're looking forward to something and it doesn't happen ? 
Wasn't gonna do this , but I got bored . Like this status and I'll post something on your wall starting with \the truth is . \"" 
Mistakes , mistakes , and more mistakes . 
I like it on the coffee table . 
Pretty much no one can be trusted . \You can trust me . \ " <<< HAH ! BULLSHIT ! 99.9% of the time at least . " 
I hate when people make stupid decisions . 
The ones you think will always be there are always the first to leave . 
Well , last night was interesting . Not what i expected . 
Why cant we have late start every Wednesday ??? 
Freedom Friday with the bestie . Daddys outta town . Partaaayy !! :) 
I'm crazy but you like itt , loca loca loca . :) Shakiraaaa <3 
I was having a great day . But hey , something always has to ruin it . 
Not the best morning so far . 
Why do people have to ask questions ?? Just like it ! 
Feeling a little rejected . Not so fun . 
Ahh , I hate sluts . 
Off to the concert . Choir concert at 7 at redhill lutheran church . I think .. :p 
I don't even know who to go to when I'm having a bad day anymore . 
Why can't exes ever talk maturely ? Its pretty pathetic . Too bad it wont change no matter how hard one tries . Lol people these days . 
My phone shuts off at the WORST times . -__- 
Should've seen that one coming . Boys and their lies . 
< PROPFEMALE > , my friends , is a bitch . 
Like my status and I'll write you a letter ... \ 
Dear ___ , You have a cute _____ . If we were in a room together I would ____ . Me and you should ___ . If you hugged me I would ___ . You are ____ . I'd get your name tattooed on my ____ . :) 
It's pathetic that thattt made my day ! hahaha . 
That was a longg night . Now I'm sitting in the library at UCLA where I will be stationed for the next hour ... or three .... I don't exactly remember . hahaha . SeesterTimeee <3 
I have never seen so many people sleeping in a library before . 
Haha , just kidding ! 
It's a long way down when there's no one there to meet you on the ground . 
Mommy arrived just in time for Desperate Housewives . :) 
Okay so i need to change my password . Someone is re-adding people i deleted and supposedly adding other crazy bitches that i'm not too fond of . Yayy .. 
And who do you think you are ? Running ' round leaving scars . Collecting your jar of hearts . Tearing love apart . You're gonna catch a cold from the ice inside your soul . ~ Christina Perri . Nicely said .

Hahaha , oh my ! I love how easy it is for people to lie to themselves along with everyone around them . So pathetic . :p 
Essay time . Woo ! :/ 
Who wants to give me a ride home tomorrow ? :) 
I guess things change . People change . Everything changes . Fuck high school . 
Put this as your status if you know someone who suffers from being a USC fan . Being a Trojan Fan is a real disorder and should be taken seriously . There is still no known cure for TFD and sympathy does not help , but we can raise awareness ! 100% of UCLA fans will repost this simply because we know how to copy and paste , as well as tie our shoes . 
Skyping with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Nierman . :) Get better loser . I can only ask so many people for rides home . 
Frosty breakkk :) 
Uh oh ... Helicopters .. Never a good sign :/
