Groundhog Day owes its true origins to the ancient Greeks , who believed that an animal’s shadow was its soul , blackened by the past year’s sins . While the animal hibernates , its soul is cleansed by nature , and if it wakes up before winter is over , it will see the dirty shadow and be horrified and then return to its den for more purification .

When it’s hot and you need to cool down , little muscles at the base of each hair relax . Your hair becomes relaxed . Your sweat glands pump out body heat in sweat . Your blood vessels get big to take more heat to the skin in order to get rid of it . But when it’s cold , the arrector muscle pulls the hair up . The duct to the sweat glands gets small to conserve heat . Our blood vessels also get small to save heat .

The first human-made object to break the sound barrier was a whip . As the energy increases from the handle to the end of the whip , the energy is moving beyond the speed of sound at the tip . That’s why a whip makes such a loud cracking noise .
