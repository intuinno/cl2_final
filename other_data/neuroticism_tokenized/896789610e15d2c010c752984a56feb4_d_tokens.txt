WEll , it sucks , but i had to make a new facebook acount because of some odd glitch . They make it impossible to get ahold of them to see about correcting things like this . 

Well , tomorows my birthday , and i've almost gotten to the point where it just feels like another day . Oh well , i'm sure it will be fun . 
BAH !!! Power's out , but the wireless is still up ? Who am i to complain though , im on a laptop in the dark on Facebook . Just like every other teen my age ... sigh 
Power's back and it's my birthday . FTW !! 
I just read \valkyrie101 says : Jesus was a communist . \ " Oh the things you will hear on political threads . Which leads me to - Why is religion coming up at all in politics ? " 
is watching one hit wonders of the 80s with my mother , Jeez , some of the music was lame , but it's fun and kinda catchy too . I even recognize some of these songs , too =) 
What's on my mind is what's on everyone's mind ... CHEETOPUFFS !!! 
Anyone gonna order Thumb÷Socks ? It'll make you a safer driver , yo . 
decided to try face book mobile on the phone seems to work well enough . also in starting to like predictave txt seems like it works well enough to save a small amount me time but it can be difficult at times too 
I just realized that i have absolutely no phobias at all ... Cool . 
I'm apparently wolf-like ? All the quizzes seem to think so anyways =) 
Just bought the resurgence pack for Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 . Can't wait to try it out ! 
A warning to the people\

Chillin in my room , blasting Rush and playing CoD , good times . 
Without order nothing can exist - without chaos nothing can evolve . 
A wise man will make more opportunities than he finds\ 
\More than any other time in history 
Just did a 45 minute bike ride . I don't normally ride just to ride , but i feel great ! 
Just made my own dinner of of fried chicken . Something about just cooking for yourself makes the food better . 
As I get better and better at Call of Duty , i find myself wanting a group of people to play with consistently ... \ 
Current song - The Trees by Rush 
Woke up at 5:00 to work out , I'm sore now , but I haven't been this awake in the morning at all this year . 
It's nice when I get a < PROPMALE > in a class to just mess with my phone and get on facebook or whatever . 
Ran the mile today , and I got a lot closer to my end of year goal ( under 8 minutes ) . I came in with a time of 10 minutes and 4 seconds . Honestly , i thought it was gonna take me closer to 12-13 minutes , so I'm pretty happy about that . 
is bored . 
I had to walk to school today because I got up late . Someone took student ID , so I didn't get to eat lunch today . Also I'm sore and tired . Today has not been a good day ... 
I'm Bored . What should I do ? 
Figured i would try this out on x box . Not super impressed ... 
Internet is being flaky , so no updates or stuff today . 
meh 
So yesterday I felt sick and sore . Today , somehow , I have managed to start feeling even worse . I just love life ! 
I just love being painfuly sick , weak feeling , and all around terrible whilst lost and 20 minutes from home . What and awesome day . THANKS LIFE ! 
I am ashes where I was once fire . 
Stupid Comcast . Why do we pay you for internet if it goes down all the time ! 
So I got to be in a car . Lost . For 2 hours . You know why ? Someone thought it would be a good idea to close the one ramp that would take us to where we would need to go . And it was the only ramp closed . And they did a great job giving us a warning , or better yet , detour info . In the end we got helped out by cholos down by Prospect . Fun night . 
Is this the end of all we know -\ 
Innocence lost so long ago\ 
Woven in dreams - the darkest of\

Decades of greed , plague , famine and\

living like fools - chaos will rule this\ 
eternal paradise 
Sweet Jamaican baked beans . Kudos if you get the reference . 
You make every part of me\ 
Stand up and fight\ 
To save the whole world\ 
Turn what’s dark into light\ 
Want to do more\ 
Be the one you adore\ 
The more time that passes by\ 
It all becomes much clearer why you are\ 
Different from everyone\ 
This world confuses me\ 
But ever since the fuse in me has lit\ 
I’ve wondered what I could do\ 
It’s the way you are . 
Darkness finally descended and twilight finished it's daily ( nightly ? ) vigil . \

Playing fable 3 . It's pretty awsomwle 
Planets devastated\ 
Mankind's on its knees\ 
A saviour comes from out the skies\ 
In answer to their pleas\

He is the Painkiller 
I'm so bored that I'm playing Castlevania

Politicians alwas speak the truth ... When they call eachother liars . =P 
When the < PROPMALE > wage war it's the poor who die . 
So apparently the astrological signs have been changed up a bit . While i personally don't care , i feel bad for all the people that got tattoos of their signs . 
Remember when people weren't jerks all the time ? Yeah ... me either . 
What you take wont kill you but careful what you're given 
Bah ! Cut my finger playing guitar =\\ 
I have 2 things to say . First : question anything and everything , always . Second : Pain is only an obstacle to keep you from getting what you want or need . Overcome it . 
Fight through the pain . 
There is no weakness in honest sorrow , only in succumbing to depression over what cannot be changed . 
C4 + UAV = pwnage 
Depression is just anger without enthusiasm . 
IT's been a weird day and it's not even noon yet . 
Ravioli Florentine ... Yum ! =D 
You wanted perfect ? I've got your perfect right here , but I'm to perfect for someone like you . 
Gummy bears are awesome =D

Why try when I know that we all die ? 
Shani-qua don't live here no more !

Have you ever wondered which hurts the most : saying something and wishing you had not , or saying nothing , and wishing you had ?

Anyone else think that Spartacus is the the epic-est series in the past 2 years ?

Why can't we as human beings just get along ? Why all the hate and deciet ? Look at dogs for an example . Peaceful loving creatures ( hunting being the exception , but that's necessity ) until a person imposes fear or hate or anger upon them . Why are humans so corrupt ? 
Enjoy what you have before it vaniahes , leaving you missing it . 
Sitting in the corner so i can see everyone . I'd make a good assassin .
