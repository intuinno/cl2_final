In that land , the constitution contemplated that the people would be governed by two separate levels of government national and local . Matters that concerned the people most intimately health , education , welfare , crime and environment were to be left almost exclusively to the local level , so that those who made and enforced the laws lived close to the people who were subject to the laws , and felt their effects .

To everyone who is calling for stricter gun laws in light of the tragedy in Tucson , may I offer this little tidbit : If guns kill people , then pencils misspell words , cars drive drunk , and spoons make people FAT .
