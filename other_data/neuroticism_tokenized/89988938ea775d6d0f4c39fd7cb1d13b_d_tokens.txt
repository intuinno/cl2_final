Please put this as your status if someone you have known has been killed by Lord Voldemort or any of his followers .

Will you make this your status for at least one hour ?

debating whether or not i'm going to finish my homework 
after my awesomely awesome UPenn interview , i then proceeded to old navy where i purchased 2 pairs of jeans for $20 ! i can't keep this smile off my face =D 
i have concluded that a certain ENGLISH TEACHER ( who shall remain nameless ) has gone INSANE . no SANE teacher assigns this much homework in one night when she KNOWS we have 5 other classes . she needs to be COMMITTED . 
Ummm ... I think my dad just spiked my tea ... : -*

< PROPFEMALE > Alexandria : \People need washing machines . I should be a washing machine designer . That's where all the money is . \"" 
you know you love your dog when ... you keep her inside while she has gas -__- 
I FOUND MY PHONE AT LAST !!! =]

ADVICE : don't get traffic tickets 
i'm a nerd ? yeah i am . the coolest nerd alive ;) 
Dear UPenn : \ 
i was extremely disappointed when i didn't have any mail today . i have anxiety attacks when i see mail in the mailbox . i know you don't announce decisions until march 30th , but that doesn't mean that i still don't freak out when i see a big envelope ! i don't know how much more of this i can take ! just send me my letter already ! even if it says no , it's better than the waiting ! Thanks ! \ 
Sincerely , \ 
Vero
