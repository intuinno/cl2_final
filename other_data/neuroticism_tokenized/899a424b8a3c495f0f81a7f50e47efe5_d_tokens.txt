Dear Mr. President , I hear you would like to freeze pay rates for soldiers starting next year . Would you also consider cutting your own pay to save more money for our country ? While you're at it , lets cut down congressmens pay , too . If the people who risk their lives don't get an increase in pay , why would we continue ... raising pay for those who take no risks and reap the benefits ? Keep it going if you agree . 
I love Obama !!!! He is definitely leading our country in the right direction . Being liberal is amazing <3

Just Go With It was our < PROPFIRST>'s Day movie . Freakin ' HYSTERICAL . I haven't laughed that hard in a movie in a long time . I'd definitely give it a 9.5 /10 -- aside from the \somewhat-poor\ " acting . \ 
Can I get an LOL for all of this Grammy bullshit flying around , from those who didn't even watch the Grammys ? \ 
LOL . 
This kid in class today asked me who I thought should have won the Super Bowl . I paused momentarily . Grinned . And then said Baylor . It took a moment for him to process Baylor and then he asked me , \No

I actually enjoy ' Being Human . ' <3 
[ P A R T 2 : B R A K E S ] Wow , man . \ 
So between CarQuest giving me the wrong brake shoes and me picking up the wrong drums , we spent nearly two hours just getting all the right parts . Lol . \ 
Afterward , the hub nuts ( there's 4 ) were so tight , we had to use a torch and heat one of them and hammer the crap out of the others until they gave a little . All in all , < PROPFEMALE > has new Dual Cervo Drums for her car ! <3 
Somehow , I'm imagining that the world itself -- Earth is pissed at humanity enough that she's rebelling from the inside out . Earthquakes . Floods . Tsunamis . Freak Tornadoes in winter . \
