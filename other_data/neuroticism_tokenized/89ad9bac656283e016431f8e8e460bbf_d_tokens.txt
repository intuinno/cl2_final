is enjoying her favorite wine and building a gingerbread house w/ her favorite man named < PROPFIRST > . :) 

Yay ! Happy New Years !!!! 
RAM installation was a success ! ... Except apparently Apple puts magnetic things near the Logic Board , so when I went to screw in the last screw , it got sucked INTO THE COMPUTER where all the logical parts are . >.< It better not vibrate a hole through the Logic Board ... But anyway things are running twice as fast now ! Yes ! * highfive * 
felt lonely in church today . :( Congregation was a good size , she supposes . Had just a few singers , but no guitar or flute . At least < PROPMALE > was there on the drums helping her out ( keeping her on beat and providing some very nice accompaniment :) ) 
is tiiiired . x.x But she wants sushi and bubble tea ! Don't know where she's going to get that tea , though ... 
enjoys keeping the technology lab at a comfortable 69°F . Not only does it keep the computers from overheating , but it feels good when it gets too hot outside , it feels better than the rest of the stuffy school , and it keeps most other people out because 
is exhausted , but she must keep going ! Onward ! To choir practice ! ( If only church weren't 20-25 mins away ... ) 
saw the Transformers movie ! Since it was in an IMAX theatre , she assumed that it would be in 3D . ... She was very disappointed , but the movie was still awesome anyway . ;p 
loves pop rocks ! Yeah ! 
is shocked to find out that < PROPFIRST > Mays died ! Nooooo !!!!! I liked that guy ! :'(

is now a nature photographer ! haha ... I'll upload the pics I caught of the teeny-tiny frogs and the dragonflies after I upload some others . Chronological order ftw ! 
is excited about a new job opportunity that has sprung up ! It's just a few years in the making , but if I talk to the right people now , I just might have a secure job later . B-) 
thought she was only halfway done w/ her research paper , but then discovered that her paper needed to be double-spaced and Word had it single-spaced the entire time ! haha ... Instant finish ! Now she just needs to edit it , write the intro and conclusion , an 
has so much pent-up energy she doesn't know what to do . And if talking is supposed to help fix things , then why isn't it working ? There are so many things whirling around in her head . She is so confused . 
had a great time with all her friends yesterday , as well as today ! I love you all !!! ^_^ 
had a good day hanging out w/ hers and < PROPFIRST>'s families . However , it would be for the benefit of < PROPFIRST>'s clothes if < PROPFIRST > would not jump out at her from behind beds anymore ... 
had a fun , but exhausting , day at Horseshoe Bend National Park ! Pics to come ... sometime ! ;D 
had a great time tonight hanging w/ her family . It's great to see everyone every once and a while ! :)

had a good first day back at work . Now , to enjoy the sushi she and < PROPFIRST > are going to have soon ... :) 
went shopping at < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE>'s today for work clothes because her mom told her they were having a huge sale . There were 70% off sales racks everywhere . She bought 12 articles of clothing that would have normally amounted to $406 . But she got them for ... $115 ! Yeah , baby ! 
is operating on her first computer of the school year . Hooray for bad power supplies ! 
is pondering which way to take to get to the Cheesecake Factory at Cumberland Mall . 675 to 285 , 675 to 75 , or 20 to 75 ... hmm ... 
is recovering from her freak-out . Some kind of HUGE < PROPFEMALE > /an t-t hing with wings and a stinger flew into her room and straight at her . While she was trying to get it off of her , it stung her and during the struggle to kill it , her MacBook fell off the bed and onto the floor . :( However , she made sure to flush the < PROPFEMALE > and tend to her own wounds before making sure her laptop was okay ( and it is ... so far ) . 
just had her first class of the semester . It's good to see some of the people I know again . :) 
thinks that the fitness center on campus is really nice . She will definitely bring a lock for her locker , though , next time . ;p 
should have bought her class books before classes started ... >.< 
is trying hard not to fall asleep . Oh , Portfolio/Presentation class , why must you be so boring ? 
is so * tired * and it is causing her problems . Urgh .... She just wants to fall asleep , but she still has two more classes to sit through . 
is so tired . x.x There have been a lot of things happening recently . Today it is : My car is at the Toyota dealer for a repair , and it took our group an hour and a half to install Fedora on one of the older ( crappy ) machines in the networking lab . urggggggggg ............ 
is frustrated ! Urgh ... people .... Am I really that easy of a target to pick on ? I should've been a music < PROPMALE > ...

believes that algorithms will be the end of her . x.x 
just killed a HUGE cockroach that was in the bathroom . She threw her shoe at it and now there are cockroach guts all over the floor . Eww ! 
wasn't going to say anything , but ... CSU doesn't need to be doing construction in/on the parking lots while classes are in session . It's hard enough to find a parking space , and now you've shut down 2+ double-rows of parking ... 
15 5|_||*3|2 |-|4 ><>< 0|27_ !!! 1 !! 1 ! 
believes \it's a wonderful day for pie ! \""

just submitted her HCI homework . If she can figure out how to export her < PROPFEMALE > program , then she will post it here on Facebook .

got her Halloween costume . Pics up soon . ;)

is finished !!! Configuring 30 mini-laptops in two days was * crazy * . If she wasn't the < PROPFEMALE > of keyboard shortcuts , she sure is now .

even though she had a rough day , a nice meal at the end of everything almost makes up for it all . :) 
left her coat in the car . brrrrr ..... 
had an absolutely wonderful time with Kindergarten in the technology lab today ! We had them draw self-portraits in Tux Paint , and we saw some of the most creative results ! 
is back from New Echota . It was a cool place to visit , but she's tired now . x.x 
thinks that limpy bacon is delicious . Mmm .... flavor . <3 
has a few things on her mind : -Is there a reason why people drive 30 mph on < PROPMALE > Pkwy ? -How did I get to class so early w/ said drivers and police cars crawling that hwy ? -Why do people keep staring at me ? -I really want a hot chocolate w/ whipped cream , but I don't really need it right now . 
still has her headache . x.x 
just FREAKED HERSELF OUT trying to plan her class schedule for next ( final ) semester . She knows she's taking algorithms 2 and the internship class , but she has to take 2 other upper division level courses . There are only 2 classes available to her due to her course history . And those two classes fall right before and after algorithms 2 . And they're both e-commerce classes . Not bad . Everything is going to be okay .

thought that she was getting her take-home exam today , but he's not giving those out ' till later ! Crap !! 
just spent 20 mins at McD's because someone pulled out of line in the drive-thru and orders got mixed up as a result . Drive-thru customers : Don't pull out of line !! Back booth employees : Repeat the order before having the customer pay . Drive-thru customers : Make sure the employee in back booth ( the 1st window ) repeats your order before you pay ! x.x 
is cleaning up the den . 
found her old binder full of Anime/Game sheet music while cleaning the den ! Score !!! 
found the old PlayStation , Wild Arms , < PROPFEMALE > Ocean2 , Nuclear Strike , Need for Speed2 , and all of her old hand-written cheat codes . lol If she didn't have to clean like a mad woman , she'd be playing up a storm right now . <3 
is pretty sure her hands will smell like Soft Scrub forever ... 
had a good workout at the gym . She's back on campus and was just going to play WoW till her next class , but since she's sitting somewhere where no one can look over her shoulder , she thinks she'll draw something instead .

had a practical lab exam , worked on two projects , and presented those two projects today . She is a wreck ! @_@

wishes her subconscious would quit making her have scary/creepy dreams when she decides to sleep in . It's freaking her out !! 
is sad because her power supply finally gave out . :( She ordered a new one , but hopefully it will be here soon . She thinks Apple makes wonderful computers , but manufactures the most awful power supplies .

< PROPFEMALE > Christmas , everyone ! :) 
just figured out what was in that gigantic box that mom wrapped for her for Christmas ! She was trying to fall asleep , and the answer just sprung to her out of nowhere . Nobody is awake to share this revelation with , so she decided to tell Facebook . haha ... Back to sleep ... 
some people need to remember that being sick for days and stuck in bed makes them a little cranky , especially when they'd rather spend time with certain other people . So watch what you say ! 
is recovering from her miserable sinus problems ( infection ? ) . Thank goodness for vitamins , throat lozenges , lots of hot tea , and mom . :) 
just bought some new memory for her laptop . She thought that 2GB would be enough to run a bunch of her favorite applications at the same time . Apparently not ... 
got a jury summons . Thanks a lot , < PROPFIRST > county superior court . You sure know how to end/begin a year ... 
drove halfway up her driveway this morning before she realized she forgot to put her contacts in . D'oh! But when she got to work , she was greeted with \Liz ! Thank God she's here ! \ " \ " Oh ! She is here today ! \ " ^_^ Appreciation makes ya feel good . :) "

is just chillin till she has to leave for class . 
forgot that going to < PROPMALE > in the evening means dodging pedestrians and fighting over parking spots . >.< Stupid campus . 
wants to let you know not to go get food at the pizza/sub place on campus . They'll tell you that they * just * closed , and then they'll laugh in your face . Those ladies have always been rude and disrespectful , but this is a new low .

logged on to her deviantArt account after two years of inactivity . o.O ! She updated her journal and cleaned up her messages . Then she lurked in the mspaintadventures forum for a loooooooong time .

hates that stupid Glad TV commercial ! arrrrgggg .... Go away ! 
rain + < PROPMALE > County ( drivers ) = disaster . Also , I wish it were legal to hit pedestrians that try to cross the street when they have a \no walk\ " sign and I'm trying to turn onto the side street at the main intersection . Coulda had three points just then ... "

Please put this on your status if you know someone ( or are related to someone ) who has been eaten by dragons . My wish for 2010 is that people will understand that being eaten by dragons is nothing to be ashamed of . Dragons are nearly unstoppable and are truly terrifying . 93% won't copy and paste this ... they've been eaten by dragons .

some people just won't ever learn , even when you spell it out for them ...

is NOT in the mood today ... >.< 
loves her boyfriend !!! <3 <3 <3

leave it to ONE person to ruin your day ! One person to completely ruin your mood ! One person you thought would understand you , but completely threw you out . One person you thought you could count on , and they don't give a crap about you . Why do I bother ? Why is it just one person who makes you feel like crap and throws it back in your face when you're trying to apologize ?

People act like I haven't been thinking this through , but I can't help but * not * think about it every single day . I know you're worried about me , and thank you for thinking about me , but you're just lecturing me like a kid and it's really annoying .

went to HP when she meant to go to Toshiba . >.< Wake up ! 
dislikes Toshiba support at the moment . >.< Or , at least , she doesn't like that one guy she talked to ...

is ready to get this crazy day over with . She finished up most of her internship stuff , but is working on the Gantt chart now .

as annoying as the interstate commute to work may be , NOTHING raises my blood pressure like surface-street drivers . At least on the interstate you can get into another < PROPFIRST > in order to avoid people . You're just stuck on the surface streets . I can deal with being stuck in traffic because of high volumes of cars . I can't tolerate the stupidity of one person blocking the flow of traffic because they're going 30 in a 45 . 
is leaving for dad's Smoky Bones birthday dinner . Woo-hoo , barbecue ! :D 
got her hands on The Lord of the Rings books . Time to read ! ... after I finish Inkheart . ;p

No matter how stressed out or tired she is , playing the piano makes her feel so much better . :)

IS MOVING OUT ! Woo ! She's moving into an apartment complex on 10/2 that's on the same street as her job . So instead of driving an hour both ways while fighting I-285 interstate traffic 5 days a week , she can drive less than a minute down the street . Or even walk ! :D 
was going to make a grilled cheese , but saw that there was no more bread . So she substituted w/ crepes instead . Turned out kinda burnt and limpy , so she took it off the stove and added some sliced < PROPFEMALE > tomatoes , < PROPMALE > pesto , and swiss cheese on top . She now has the most delicious homemade pizza ever !

just watched the WoW Cataclysm Cinematic Intro and thought it was kinda meh ... * shrug * It's a nice piece of animation and I really like the quality and detail , but other than that it's nothing special . :\\ 
is watching Good Burger . XDDD She loves the 90s ! <3 
did the thing where you throw a watermelon off of the roof and watch it splat ! It was spectacular ! ... except it was with a printer and off her collapsable handtruck . 8-B 
Today is a day of doing . Went to the Drs , went to Kroger , got my emissions done . Need to make lunch , do the laundry , and clean the kitchen .

Somebody close to me thinks I watch Jersey Shore . I am deeply offended . 
finally switched all her Wachovia stuff over to Wells Fargo . She feels like a dirty rotten traitor . :'(

being able to go home for lunch ( and change clothes so she can be warmer ) = awesome ! 
just got back from mass at the new church . The building is beautiful and the choir is great , but there were children * everywhere * . The non-stop chatter kinda killed the reverence ... If she doesn't make the 8:15 mass next Sunday , she'll be going to the 11:30 .

is watching \The Man in the Iron Mask\ " for the first time . Why isn't the < PROPMALE > ( < PROPFIRST > DiCaprio ) spea < PROPMALE > in an accent like everyone else ? :\\ It kinda sucks . " 
finally saw the movie Inkheart after finishing the book months ago . Despite how facts and events were changed to fit the movie scene , it was still a wonderful and amazing movie . She recommends it , even if you have read the book . ;p 
woooooah ! A 3D Yogi Bear movie ! 
Watched a solid two hours of Futurama and now everything she reads in her head sounds like Professor Farnsworth . >.< Oddly fitting while reading a history paper ... 
is frustrated . Ugh ... She doesn't deserve to be treated like this at work . 
woke up freeeeezing this morning ! Now she's got her hoodie on and is devouring a bowl of oatmeal . ... and she also turned the heat back on . ;p

Got the day off of work ! Happy snow day !

At the DMV in < PROPFIRST > Springs . boo ..... 
Grrr .. Went to Cumming today for my job and had to drive back home during rush hour . It started flurrying on 400 and people FREAKED OUT . I thought I'd try to get off and brave the surface streets but that was a VERY BAD IDEA . I am beyond frustrated and the only thing that will make me happy is comfort food and brownies ( which I have ) . /rant 
Just got her new driver's license in the mail and it is uuuuuugly . ( oh , and so is the pic ) ;p 
At Stone Mountain Park with < PROPFIRST > . :) 
My lunch break is NOT long enough . :'(
