Man . Algeria was playing a < PROPMALE > dirty there 
So I rushed to close up my windows to my car when a storm rolled through . It was at that time my car remote decided not to work so I can get in and close said windows . After about 5 minutes of futile effort to unlock my door , the remote gives in ... just as the rain stops . Jake-0 , Situationally Funny Life Events-1

Just watched EMTs work with a guy who apparently took 12 Oxys just outside my bedroom window ... Here's to being an opportune photographer ! 
I'm off to see the wizard , the wizard of Huntington Mall 
Its sooooo hooooooootttt . Photowalk will have to wait another not so muggy and hazy ( thusly shitty shooting ) day . Time to try and kill some mofo's on some COD ... and then dishes 
Anyone else find it at all odd that the highight of my friday at work is that i get to year jeans and they stocked gummy bears in the vending machine ? 
Actually , may opt for some local flavor and positive utilization of my time . Such as prepping for a GRE or two 
Fuck you economy ... Fuck you for being the ultimate result in that my box of frozen blueberry waffles now has only 8 waffles instead of the 10 it once used to . Asshole 
Aaaaaaah . Going to my options to ignore annoying ass newsfeeds ... it is rather invigorating . I think I'll start ignoring more people . 
My tolerance for old people , children under 4 , and rednecks is quickly diminishing at an exponential rate . Walmart on a friday is a bad idea 
Wait ... you mean there are CONSEQUENCES to my impulsiveness ?!?!

Good reset . Now ready for the week ahead 
Does anyone want/need a 33\x24\ " x24\ " box full of packaging peanuts ? It's been sitting in my kitchen for over a week enticing me to do something hillariously annoying to someone soon . It's best for everyone I try and get rid of it ASAP "
