re-watching the first < PROPMALE > Potter movie ... forgot how little they were ... 
just saw a bug that was almost as big as my fist ... now it is hiding from me ... also almost died from choking on my drink ... found out its hard to drink and turn your head to the side so you can see past the cup and read the computer screen ... who would have 
slowly suffocating from the country fresh smell of Raid 
just watched Gothica ... it was pretty scary i'm not gonna lie 
feels like a zombie ... when am I ever going to go to sleep ??? 
just realized that being on the computer isn't going to make me go to sleep faster ... fml 
how much deeper would the ocean be without sea sponges ???

Getting a Frapp was a bad idea ... 
Why don't they make BIG BLUE in a two liter bottle ? 
It's like killing a unicorn ... with , like , a bomb . <3 
Me + Insomina = best friends forever ... or at least for the night anyway 
I think I need more sleep ... 
I'm about to seriously CUT someone ... 
After two weeks ... we are finally getting a brand new unit for our AC ... the guy is working on it right now ... sadly though its not MR . HOT STUFF 
Okay so ... got a new AC unit ... but its not on ... and something is blowing into our vents and its only hot air ... and the guy just disappeared ... probably on his lunch break ... I'm about murder someone ... 
Freezing in my apartment :D so glad the ac is fixed

Why does my teacher want a minimum of two rough drafts for every essay ? That just INSANE .. =(

Make sure to build your home brick by boring brick , or the wolf's gonna blow it down

Awake and dressed BEFORE 11 am ? I have to say that I'm not use to this . 
MY SISTER ROCKS . She fixed my computer ! =D <- own this < PROPFEMALE > because I don't announce this often . 
How the HECK did it turn into seven o'clock ? Oh well ... TIME TO GO TO SLEEP 
hates being sick D= 
Just got ALL SIX SEASONS OF HOUSE ! Life . Complete . 
Haven't been up this early in a long time . Thanks school for deciding that my I should go to bed at a decent hour . Don't worry though , it'll never work . :] 
Everyone says there needs to be a dislike button on Facebook . You know what we also need ? A \-punches -\" button . For those circumstances when words just have no use . =D " 
Going to see Black Swan ... finally XD 
So what if I have school in the morning ? Normal people go to bed at two . :] 
I stay up late every night , and realize it was a bad idea every morning . 
Going to sleep at a reasonable hour this time . 12:39 . 
Just wondering out loud here , but where in the nursery rhyme Humpty Dumpty , does it say he was an egg ? HE COULD HAVE BEEN AN ORANGE . Or you know , a human too . 
It's six o'clock in the morning so it looks like I'm finally going to go to sleep . It's a freaking winter wonderland outside . Can't tell the difference between the concrete , street , and the grass . Nice . Looks like I'm gonna be snowed in because it's too scary to drive anywhere . Thanks weather for fudging up my plans D= 
Never mind I can't fall asleep . Looks like I'm going to be up all day . And I was just thinking , who knows about Texas weather ? For all we know this glorious snow ( which I played in at three this morning like a boss ) could be gone around noon . Everyone be safe driving in it ! Maybe plans won't be cancelled after all . P.S. I blame the neighbors for moving around at six am contributing to the fact that I can't sleep . 
Okay , I'm going to try and fall asleep again . Seven o'clock . YOU CRAZY NIGHT OWL TIME TO SLEEP . 
So pissed off right now . I'm ready to destroy world nations . 
Raspberry Sorbet from Haagen-Dazs is pretty much heaven in a cup
