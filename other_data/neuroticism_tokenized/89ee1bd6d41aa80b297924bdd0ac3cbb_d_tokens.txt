some people just have bitchiness running through there veins . but , I think its funny , because along with the bitchiness is a giant amount of stupidity . 
some people have lost all sanity , and are retarded ( literally ) ... Mabie they will see one day that that's why they dont have any friends , and everyone thinks they are both bitches . I can see it runs in the family .

Picking up my beautiful wedding ring tomorrow !!! =)))))) 
You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything . You've got to be your own man , not a puppet on a string . Never compromise what's right , and uphold your family name . You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything . ( AT )

1 Corinthians 13:4 -7 \ 
Love is patient and kind . Love is not jealous or boastful or proud or rude . It does not demand its own way . It is not irritable , and it keeps no record of being wronged . It does not rejoice about injustice but rejoices whenever the truth wins out . Love never gives up , never looses faith , is always hopeful , and endures every circumstance .

went to the doctor today to get my anxiety & panic attacks under control & he gave me an antidepressant ( which works on anxiety too ) . I just really hope it works !!!

Judgemental people , you'll find out one day that your wrong . Judging someone's faith without knowing them can hurt them . Be careful , you can completely turn someone off from Christianity by doing that . \ 
\Do not judge others and you will not be judged . For you will be treated as you treat others . The standard you use in judging is the standard by which you will be judged . \ " < PROPFIRST > 7 : 1-2 " 
invitations .......... check\
