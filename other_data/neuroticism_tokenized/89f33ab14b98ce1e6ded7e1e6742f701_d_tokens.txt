No kiss at midnight for me :( 

If 2010 starts as bad as 2009 is ending then somebody please put me outta my misery . 
This night is looking up ! 
Sometimes it's not the optimist you need , but another pessimist to walk beside you and know , absolutely know , that it really is as bad as you think . 
In need of advice 
This year I'm am going to be more cautious about who I let in my life and who I trust . 
been up all night with my sick ' lil girl , poor baby ! :(

Glitter is the herpes of arts and crafts . It stays on you forever . 
if you state anywhere on your Facebook that your ' unique ' , then i probably hate you . What a bland and unoriginal concept . It's usually preceded or followed by ' Either love me or hate me ' which is also a ridiculous concept , as if there the only two feelings we can have about you . Realize this you self-righteous hypocrite , your unique , just like everybody else ... \ " , 201 0-0 3-21 23:28:08 "

OK I ADMIT , I'M A HANDFUL !!! Unfortunately most women won't repost this . I'm strong willed , independent , and outspoken , I make mistakes , I am out of control and at times hard to handle - but if you can't handle me at my WORST then you sure don't deserve me at my BEST . If you're a HANDFUL then post this on your status . ... I DARE YOU

Yeah ... we'll see .

My mom ruins my life ! 
Truth only reveals itself when one gives up all preconceived ideas . 
I need some magic in my life . 
Ha . I knew it . So predictable . 
While you SCREAM at your woman , there's a man wishing he could talk softly to her ear . While you HUMILIATE , OFFEND and INSULT her , there's a man flirting with her and reminding her how wonderful she is . While you HURT your woman , there's a man wishing he could make love to her . While you make your women CRY there's a man stealing smiles from her . 
Eyes are aching for sleepy time . 
Was alseep for a few and when I opened my eyes , my dog was laying on my chest in my face just staring at me ... freaked me out . Now she won't stop barking . She never barks . I don't know what's up with her tonight . 
Nothing like a nice calming thunderstorm to sleep to . <3 
Slept so well that I overslept and now I can't get coffee . :( 
Every work day should include a one hour nap immediately following lunch .

My boyfriend is simply the best <3 
I love < PROPFEMALE > ! She's so awesome ! :) 
Just ugh , with a side of ugh . 
If you take the human mind out of the equation , what is the universe ? All it is is waves and energy . There is no form to it , and no beauty . Also , without the mind , does the concept of knowledge still exist , or is knowledge something artificial created by the existence of a mind capable of understanding it ? 
I just have to tell everyone that my kids are the most amazing beings on this planet ! <3 
Is it strange that I find < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > pretty sexy ? 
I so want me some Mexican food or BWW . :( 
If you were to kill some one by hitting them on the head with a hammer would you use the hammer end or the claw end ??

I don't know if it's the medication I'm on but I've been having the most strange , odd , unusual , crazy and ridiculously vivid dreams lately . 
I should totally clean out the inside of my car more often . :) 
\I'm a stitch away from making it and a scar away from falling apart \"" 
He who angers you , also conquers you . 
Treat me somewhere cruel \ 
You can throw me away \ 
As long as I feel it \ 
Show me something true\ 
You can deceive me \ 
I am yours to use

Poolside again today ... ready for a shower then movie and bed . :) 
I miss having a baby . I want one so bad . :-( 
There is nothing more dreadful than the habit of doubt . Doubt separates people . It is a poison that disintegrates friendships and breaks up pleasant relations . It is a thorn that irritates and hurts ; it is a sword that kills . -\ 
Buddha 
I think my almost six year old is starting to get separation anxiety . Isn't she a lil old for that ? 
Need to talk to someone ... how come I'm always there for everyone else yet when I need someone , no one is there ?

Babysitting ... hopefully can get them in bed early and hit the pool up tomorrow . :)

It kinda sucks when the people you know , become the people you knew . When you can walk right past someone like they were never a big part of your life . How you used to be able to talk for hours and now you can barely even look at them . 
Getting stuff ready for < PROPFEMALE>'s bday party tomorrow ! :)

Yup . I got zero sleep last night . Todays gonna suck . Definitely need to learn how to turn my brain off . 
I wish that in real life everyone would just all of a sudden burst out into song and dance :-D

Shrimp fettuccine < PROPMALE > , jalapeno biscuits and caesar salad ... can't wait til dinners ready ! :) 
Watching The Sing-off ! It's like Glee on drugs . Love it ! <3 
Why do I always get a sudden burst of energy when I'm actually super tired ?

It's not even 7 am yet and someone has already managed to irritate me . 
Anyone think its gonna be too cold to bundle my kids up and go to the lights walk thru tonight ? They really wanna go but I'm afraid they'll freeze .

Listening to Glee Christmas and wrapping presents with my Lil Miss < PROPFEMALE > G . <3 
Life can be full of amazing people and experiences ... So thankful and lucky to share mine with such a great guy ! <3 
I hope that some day humanity will grow up , leave its religious infancy behind , and reason as adults about moral issues . 
And although there's pain in my chest , I still wish you the best with a ... forget you . 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas < PROPFEMALE > ! This snow is so pretty ! 
The children were nestled all snug in their beds ... 
Aquasand is pretty neat to play with but cleanup is very messy . 
You know your kids are worn out when they fall asleep in the bath tub . 
Wonderful weekend . My heart feels full . And that is rare these days .

I wonder if they do interventions for 4 year olds who are addicted to < PROPFIRST > Party on the Wii ? 
the kids are playing some sort of whole-house shrieking hide -&- seek tag game--I'm hiding in my bedroom .... 
The children are all tucked in bed . The house is quiet . Next door , that is . This place sounds like Animal House .... 
Trying to get kids to nap so they can hopefully behave the rest if this year . 
Shouldn't these kids be in bed already ? Who's in charge here ? Lol . 
Ah , Sleep . You elusive little vixen , you .... 
Who needs an alarm clock when u got a daughter who can slap ur face til u wake up ?!! 
Half-way thru first cup of coffee -- I just know my brain will engage shortly ... 
Who knew that I could be stressed and at peace . All at the same time . It's such an odd combination . 
Experiencing side effects of low exposure to high density coffee drink , headache is commencing . Need to remedy . 
Taking girls to see Tangled , then dinner . 
I could very well be going crazy . Terrifyingly possible . 
\I'll catch a Grenade for you\ " . I don't think < PROPMALE > Mars has ever seen Jersey Shore . " 
Stressful day ! Can't wait to unwind with bath and Jersey Shore tonight . 
Coffee is a magical beverage that turns terrible days into tolerable days .

I'm so in love with my life right now ! ! 
Bed . 
Why can't everyday be as pleasant as this one . :) 
I'm pretty sure one day the truth will come out that all < PROPMALE > Hardy clothing was designed by a 3rd grader on acid . 
There are just some people who're ridiculously intolerable . 
Yup . I managed to somehow fall in the washing machine . Go me .

People who urge you to be realistic generally want you to accept their version of reality . 
Why do I attempt to clean and organize ? These princesses are animals . 
< PROPFIRST > Tosh is the cutest douchebag ever ! 
Watching < PROPMALE > Jr. with Vanna ... then going to lunch with < PROPFEMALE > and Becca . 
I can't make a good decision to save my life . 
You think you're so cool cause you can pee with your penis . 
My kids have a gift . In bed , then ten minutes later asleep . If only it were that easy for sleep to come my way . 
Why does cereal taste so much better at night ? 
I eat so many gummi vitamins a day I think I'm actually killing myself . 
I feel like at some point , Uggs became the footwear equivalent of wearing pajamas to the grocery store . 
I'm really just a kid with boobs and regrets . 
\If you can make a girl laugh you can make her do anything . \ " - < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > "

My hands are very dry . \ 
They're about to shrivel up and rot off . \ 
It's that bad , yes .
