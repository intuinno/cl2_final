Thanksgiving = food , and more food , drinks and more drinks and games :) It was a blast ! 
Had an absolutely awesome time last night ... Josh , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > and I played ( and beat ! ) the original < PROPFIRST > game . I guess this Thanksgiving break will hereafter be refered to as ' The < PROPFIRST > Thanksgiving'- who will ever forget ? ;) 
What can I say ?... This T-break was pretty awesome ; between some rock < PROPFEMALE > partying and a few excited games of Catchphrase , < PROPFIRST > and Apples to Apples , there was hardly a dull moment . I just wish there were pics that captured some of the more hilarious moments !... they would have been classics :) 
In < PROPFIRST > town visiting Kristen ... man it really is a winter wonderland up here !
