So at the library they had a create your own cover contest . There were 50 entries from about 4 libraries and there was 9 winners . 3 first place , 3 second and so on . The categories were Drawing 12-15 , Drawing 16-19 , and Photography/other . So I made a painting of the book Flipped , they said to take a not so good cover and make what you think is better so I painted a sycamore tree with eggs in the bottom which symbolize the book very good , and I was so nervous cuz like 50 ENTRIES !!!!!!! A REAL LIFE CONTEST TOO !!! Not just some friend one , it had judges and EVERYTHING XD And I was screaming with happyness when I got 3rd place for the Photography/Other . My best friend got 3rd place of Drawing 16-19 . She's < PROPFEMALE > and an amazing artist . We both got 10 dollar Game Stop giftcards , I'm so happyyyyyy ~ First time in a contest ~ So ya , that was LONGGGGGG , so I guess it's too late to say you don't need to read it XD But yaaaaaaa , tomorrow is club picture day , so it's gonna be hectic ~ !!!!

I FOUND OUT WE HAVE PIANO LAB AT SCHOOL !!! I'm definitly going to do that next year , I've always wanted to learn the piano , it's like a dream come true ~ 
I literally just came back from school . I've been in theater this whole time . I love it , it's addicting , and a senior from there saved my bike , carried the whole thing above our fence , and anyone from < PROPMALE > would know how high those fences are . 
My money was stolen . I'm really pissed right now . The only thing that makes my day is volunteering and going to meetings after school . There are too many places I can help out , way to many I'm going overload .... 
I just dicovered 21 questions , and I'm sorry to anyone who has gotten like an answer from me because it turns out that about half of them didn't mean what I thought they meant , like the dutch oven , pass on the choclate cake , and stuff like that , I mean , how people can come up with these things in the first place are beyond me .... \ 
So ya , please don't be angry cuz I didn't know what it meant , so now I'm gonna stop ... \ 
like big time ... \ 
I think I'm only good for Bingo . 
I learned that my family started out with a turkish man . Then , all the women in my line of the family were turkish who where found and married by iraqi men . My great great great great grandmother was the girl that won the first iraqi man's heart by being so beautiful while playing the harp so beautifully . After that she got 4 children , in which my great great great grandfather was born from and he was the one that taught the people around him during his day how to read and write . And going down from there is a long long list that my mommy is still trying to piece together . Many names are lost , and I found that I have like eighth cousins who I never even heard of before and who are alive today XD Scary when you think of it ... 
Oh man , I have to do an all nighter for the first time because I'm still no where NEAR finished with my homework . Even my Ceramics 2 class gave me hw . I'm so tired right now , I don't know how I'm going to function tomorrow ....
