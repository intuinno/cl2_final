Here comes \The Sheriff\ " Peyton Manning ... Colts all day . " 
If there's one thing I'm annoyed about is the fact that every commercial has been a < PROPMALE > Light commercial . Who really likes that beer , that much , anyway ? I'd rather see them bring back the < PROPMALE > Bowl .

Alright , we get the point that it's snowing and to stay in to allow the plows to clean the streets ... now back to our regularly scheduled programs , PLEASE !?!? 
feels like his arms are going to explode from all the shoveling . The random plow that came down our street , twice , made it a whole lot easier too ... good times . 
Back to shoveling and the relaxing to a season of \Arrested Development . \ " They never should've canceled that show . Absolutely hysterical ... " 
is enjoying having dinner made for him . caesar salad , blackened salmon w/ sauteed spinach and rice . and for desert .... oreo cheesecake that my < PROPFIRST > baked last night . she's amazing ... 
payed a visit to < PROPFEMALE > Hospital today only to find out that I have a \High Ankle Sprain\ " and will be in a cast for 2 weeks ... " 
is watching my neighbor shovel like an idiot by burying < PROPFEMALE>'s car with snow from his car . I'm tempted to go out there , with one leg and show him that there's a certain way to do things . Just like my dad always told me ... 
Would like to thank my sis for taking her gimpy brother out to do some necessary food shopping . Looking in my fridge now , it actually looks like people live here . I also felt like an older family member going out and running erins during the day . 1 more week until this cast comes off ... 
The Eagles release < PROPFIRST > Westbrook ... now how do they get LT ? 
In < PROPFIRST > Miller We Trust ... 
Heartbreaker ... US showed some guts and played a hell of tournament . Keep your heads up boys ...

hopes everyone enjoys their \Halladay\ " today ... " 
will be at \The Heron\ " tonight supporting < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE>'s effort to open their resturant . Any little bit to help you guys ;) " 
Nice job < PROPFEMALE > . Just because you're a #5 seed doesn't mean you're automatically in the next round . You actually have to show up and play . At least the weahter is beautiful and tomorrow's the first day of spring ...

BOOOOOOOOOOOOOUCHER !!!! WHAT A GAME !!!! 
\AND CARCILLO SCOOOOOOOOOOOORES !!!! < PROPFIRST > CARCILLO WINS IT FOR THE FLYERS !!!! \ " Great way to end the weekend boys !! " 
Does anyone else love Carcillo's reaction after he scored ? If there's one change they should make , though , is that whenever < PROPFIRST > Carcillo scores it should be for \a case of roasted peppers . \ " That's my pisan ! " 
Does anyone else love Carcillo's reaction after he scored ? If there's one change they should make , though , is that whenever < PROPFIRST > Carcillo scores it really should be for , as < PROPFIRST > Weiser said Sunday , \for a case of roasted peppers . \ " That's my pisan ! "

Tutti Cuore . 
< PROPFEMALE > Gagne . History Was Made Tonight .

is a Broad Street Bulliever 
Tough loss tonight boys . Makes it that much easier to forget about and to take care of business Tuesday night . 
It's 8:00 ... need I say more ? LETS GO FLYERS !!! 
Heartbreaker ... Thanks for the ride boys , NO ONE expected you guys to be playing in June . By the way , Con Smythe should have went to < PROPMALE > ... 
feels like last night's game ended just like The Sopranos Series Finale ... The greatest tournament of all , The World Cup starts tomorrow !! 
would love to see Mexico and < PROPFEMALE > get smoked today in their opening matches . 
\You know it's funny what a young man recollects ? ' Cause I don't\ 
Do not lose your composure . If they can score 2 goals in one half , we can score 2 goals . 
I'll tell you what , these asshole refs need to get off their high horse and stop thinking they're bigger than the game . They never will be . 
3-2 FINAL USA ... I hope that linesman checks the video playback and realizes how much he blew that call ... 
Frank : Don't even joke about hunting no man . \ 
Dennis : Who's joking ? I'm not joking . \ 
Frank : Oh yeah ? Well , I was hunted once . I'd just came back\ 
from ' < PROPFEMALE > . I was hitching through Oregon and some cop started harassing\ 
me . Next thing you know , I had a whole army of cops chasing me through\ 
the woods ! I had to take ' em all out -- it was a bloodbath ! 
is watching probably one of the most powerful of documentaries I've ever seen . ESPN'S 30 for 30 \The Two Escobars . \ " Columbia in the 90's . Enough Said . " 
so Dempsey purposely stands in line with the last defender and still gets called offsides . Hey linesman , it's where the player is when THE BALL IS KICKED NOT WHEN HE RECEIVES THE BALL . Do your freakin job ... 
Arjen Robben of Holland is just sick ... 
Really ? LeBron needs to have a tv show to announce where he's going ? Sooooo lame dude ... Viva Espana !! 
Was at the Phils game tonight to witness a tough loss but my Dad still enjoyed every minute . That's a win for me ;) 
may angels lead you in , mom-mom . we all love you and will miss you ... 
Can't think of a better way to round off a long day of Christmas shopping ... A bottle of wine and It's A Wonderful Life with my lovely little lady ... 
Wow , Thank you all for the birthday wishes ! This Hoegaarden is for all of you , Cheers ! 
Remembers when he USED to love this weather ... 
I was in a great mood , had a fun day looking for kitchen counter tops , had a fantastic evening with < PROPFEMALE > , her brother and my parents for dinner . All was great until I finally come home to find that some jerk off moved MY chairs out of MY SPOT in front of MY HOUSE that I SHOVELED for 2 Hours . 
The human torch was denied a bank < PROPFEMALE > 
It's been a long time since Twenty-Two 
Not a happy camper right now ... tooth pulled and a mouth full of gauze ... awesome . 
You can call me \Uncle Tony\ " now ! Congrats < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE >!"
