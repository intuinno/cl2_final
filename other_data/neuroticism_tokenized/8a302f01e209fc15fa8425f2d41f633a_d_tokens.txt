Lunch : salad , with tuna and DRIED MICHIGAN CHERRIES . Thanks , Mom . 

Has extra tickets for the University of Chicago graduation . ... Can you believe it ? Stand in the rain for 45 minutes , then nobody even bothers to take your tickets when you get to the event . 
says Thank You So Much to everyone who helped to make The Graduation a Huge Success ! 
also watches the chickens ( 6 ) after work . 
Noticed that the FDIC closed SEVEN banks today . Usually it is zero , one , two , or three . Last week it was five . That was a little bit disturbing . But seven ? Query : will it always be a prime number ? 
is back online , after four days with no modem . 
is irritated that , the day after he got his new modem , the blogging service went down for an upgrade . 
put his hat on , and spent much of the afternoon collecting mesquite and yucca seeds , then buying them all over the place . Few will ever sprout . But some will . 
got twenty pounds of freshly-roasted chile today . Now my Subaru will have a delightfully spicy aroma for a week or two . 
No one should die because they cannot afford health care , and no one should go broke because they get sick . If you agree , please post this as your status for the rest of the day . 
tried transplanting palo verde trees today . We'll see how they do . If I can get one to grow by the arroyo , then everyone downstream will have them too . Eventually . 
Angel food cake with NO FROSTING . Instead : brandied cherry-chocolate sauce ! 
did not expect to see snow , whilst planting daffodil bulbs . 
If you seek a pleasant peninsula ... 
I won't post any downer economic collapse articles this weekend ; only growing things . 
4 inches of rain in the last 36 hours , with more to come . ( Normal is 8 inches per year . ) Plus there is snow on the mountains . 
< PROPFIRST > got here last night . The t-shirts and cherries came this morning . Thank you , everyone . 
About the clutter . < PROPFEMALE > and I are playing Farmville . This generates messages on Facebook , messages that are of no interest to anyone not playing . To stop seeing this clutter , follow these steps : point your mouse at one of the offending items . The word \hide appears in the upper right . Click the word \ " hide\ " . Additional options appear . Click \ " Hide Farmville . \ " You still we see any of our other items . " 
No snow yet down south , but it is raining . Snow is expected , but only a trace . 
< PROPFIRST > and I planted four trees on Monday , and today we got an inch of rain . There are two pecan trees ( to pollinize each other ) , an all-in-one almond ( two varieties grafted , so no additional pollinizer needed ) , and a pomegranate ( self-pollinizing ) . Life is easy , sometimes . 
is sad to see < PROPFIRST > go , but very happy he was able to be here . 
Hard drive problem ? Made funny noises twice and failed to boot . Finally booted ( obviously ) . I am going to install a new one now . Don't expect updates for a few minutes ( hah ! ) . Of course the last time this happened , I installed a new drive , used the old one for backup , and the old continued working for years . So this could all be a waste of time and money . 
My cat is looking for the door into summer . 
is glad that his car is not infested with Madagascar Hissing Cockroaches . 
0.7 inches of rain !!! 
100% of people will not copy and paste this . 
Here's what I tell anybody and this is what I believe . The greatest gift we have is the gift of life . We understand that . That comes from our Creator . We're given a body . Now you may not like it , but you can maximize that body the best it can be maximized . -- < PROPFIRST > Ditka No thanks . -- jcy 
It's Doppleganger week - change your profile picture to someone famous you have been told you resemble . Remember these are who we have been TOLD we look like -- not necessarily our own beliefs ... Some guys in Jamaica called me < PROPMALE > , so that counts . 
Thanks everyone for all the help . At this point , Ijust need 1 harmess , 2 horseshoes , 2 nails , and 2 boards ; no bricks . I can give gifts of harnesses and horseshoes , as of this moment . 
Has anyone figured out how to filter the Facebook feeds , using the new Facebook < PROPFEMALE > ? I will be annoyed if this functionality has been lost . 
I have harnesses and horseshoes . Let me know if either would be helpful to you . 
When I was younger I would record my favorite songs onto a piece of papyrus . 
I had just opened the wine , and we were going to get into the hot tub , then everyone started posting collections . 
< PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > fertilized my farm , but the glitch monster ate the thank-you bonus : ( 
I have not blocked anyone . Disregard any notice to the contrary . 
Cloudy , cold , and < PROPFEMALE > all day ... and all we get is a quarter-inch of rain . 
Is looking forward to a visit from Dad , < PROPMALE > , and Lisanne 
It appears thatt he Facebook feeds are not reliable . Some posts simply don't show up . 
< PROPFEMALE > and I are thinking of starting a patty-pan squash c o-o p in Farmville , within a few hours . However , we want to have at least two other players lined up , in order to be sure of getting a gold medal . Please let us know if interested . 
They are here . Or at least at La Quinta . The motel , not the street . 
MAKING DRUG TEST MANDATORY FOR WELFARE : Shouldn't this apply also to corporate welfare , meaning that most banking and investment professionals would also be included ? Or anyone taking public money ? Congressmembers , mayors , teachers ? Come to think of it , all money is public money . So everyone should be included . 
I'm an American Businessman . I should be able to conduct my business is whichever language(s ) I like , in order to be successful , even if it means that people have to press 3 for Russian . 
Got a Rhode Island Red , then a Scots Grey , in two successive < PROPFEMALE > mystery eggs . 
???? ???? ???, ?? ??? ????????? 
I could use 5 more clicks for the barn-raising , if anyone has a few extra clicks laying around ! \

I once drove a Prius back all the way from Kalamazoo . 
Joined the group \I bet we can find 6.0221415 ×10^23 particles that want to be a mole . \"" 
< PROPFIRST > needs a schoolhouse plow for her Farmville farm . Therefore , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > , and I plan to start a \Very < PROPFIRST > Field Trip\ " c o-o p job later tonight . This will require 1000 cranberries and 750 grapes ( helpful to those of us with Wineries ) 
I will start a Very < PROPFIRST > Field Trip job in Farmville in one hour . 
Sure , I'll be spontaneous ... tomorrow . 
got a fairly substantial raise in salary yesterday . 
There is a largish hole next to the house . Work has begun . 
Our internet is down . Using wifi ztsushi plce . 
Sushi place has no spell check . 
Tonight I learned that it is difficult to look straight up , using binoculars , for more than a few seconds . 
We have now passed the point of peak middle class . 
I suspect we can agree on this : < PROPFEMALE > Palin has jumped the moose . 
My cell phone is broken .
