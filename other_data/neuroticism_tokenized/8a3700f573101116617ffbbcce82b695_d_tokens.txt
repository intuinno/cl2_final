^^ I got my DJ software to work 

is back from campin ^^ 
I get to mow the lawn today ..... fun fun 
Well , I went to Jafax , it was fun ^^ 
If I could figure out how to sell bottled emotions , I'd be friggin < PROPMALE > 
* Sigh * 
So , might finaly get a job , yay me 
thinks that being alone sux ... 
wonders how many he has to go through before they quit telling him \Your < PROPFEMALE > is in another castle \"" 
is bored ..... but i found out i can go to facebook on my psp , yey lerning new thing 
has no clue why he's still awake at four thirty-something in the morning ... 
Well , my phone's dead as a doornail ... The charging slot broke and the batterie finaly died , so it doesnt work anymore ... 
woke up at four in the morning and cant fall back asleep .... >.< 
doesnt know what to do anymore .... I need a job , or a friend to talk to , some thing 
Well , unity was fun ^^ 
wonders why people think being ' Ok ' is a bad thing . ITS A GOOD THING PEOPLE , IT JUST MEANS NOTHING'S GOING ON 
you would date me , like this status . If you WANT to date me , inbox me . If you love me , put a heart ?. If your my friend , put a smiley face :) If you hate me , put an angry face >:| If your upset with me , put a sad face . :( Copy this in your status & see how people feel about you\ 
(( I copied this from someone else )) 
is home alone again , with nothing to do , nowhere to go , and no one to talk to .... So ... Going to Mc Donalds for an ice tea ^^ 
is sick as a dog .... Being sick sux >.< 
I hate love songs , every tiime one comes on it seems to be the one that punches a current soft spot 
So , I got a call from < PROPFIRST>'s Club , apparently I might have a job 
I thought the point of dating someone was so you didnt have to be social , you had the person you want to talk and < PROPFEMALE > out with right next to you , thus , nowhere to go but the couch ^^ 
wonders what I had to have done to cause people to log off every time I log on 
Thanks everyone for wishing me a happy birthday 
How many times do i have to hit my funnybone till it quits hurting and finaly makes me smile ? 
why does boredom have to be so boring ? Anyone know ? 
Going on the road with < PROPMALE > , see ya'll later 
Well , I'm back from going on the road with < PROPMALE > , thats good news ... right ? 
Going on the road with < PROPMALE > again 
I wish I was better at comunicating with other people , mabey if I was I would be able to tell them how I realy feel 
We're already almost done , only one stop left till we're on our way home 
How come every time I turn the radio on , it seems to play the one song with the right words in it to open old wounds ? 
I get to sit at home alone today ... weee ... ( Extra sarcasm XD ) 
We're on our way home , should be back arround 9ish 
Goin back on the road again , and this trip looks like its gonna be hell 
Well , the truck had a little electrical fire today , nothing big , we're both ok , but i dont think we're gonna go anywhere for a while ;; 
Never mind , we where told to head on home 
Hooray for the amazing consistancy that is my life ^^ 
I'm going to make this my status till somethng changes >.< 
So , I knocke my laptop off its stand last night , and now the screen wont stay up and pieces are falling off ..... great , just great , what else can go wrong ? 
' And I was gunna ventalate < PROPFEMALE > mind with this here gun bullet ' \\n Early Kailer , Squidbillies 
Hmm ... facebook has stoped letting me see comments ... Why Facebook , why ? 
Why , when ever you have a knife in your back , does the world believe you could use another one ?
