PLEASE put this on your status if you know someone ( or are related to someone ) who has been eaten by pandas . Pandas are nearly unstoppable and , in case you didn't know , they can also breathe fire . 93% of people won't copy and paste this , because they have already been eaten by pandas . 6% of people are sitting in the shower armed with fire extinguishers and the remaining 1% are awesome and will repost . 
Rain , rain go away come again another day !

Time passes . \ 
Life happens . \ 
Distance separates . \ 
Children grow up . \ 
Colleagues forget favors . \ 
But ... \ 
Friends are there . When you have to walk that lonesome valley , and you have to walk it by yourself , your friends will be on the valley's rim , cheering you on , praying for you , and waiting with open arms at the valley's end . Sometimes they will even break the rules and walk beside you-or come in and < PROPFEMALE > you out .

BOY do i LOVE tangled :) 
Days will come when you don't have the strength\ 
And all you hear is you're not worth anything \ 
Wondering if you ever could be loved\ 
And if they truly saw your heart \ 
They'd see so much\ 
\ 
You're beautiful , You're beautiful\ 
You are made for so much more than all of this\ 
You are treasured , you are sacred , you are His\ 
You're beautiful 
the will of God will never take you where the grace of God will never protect you :D 
GOD'S LOVE\ 
If you took the love of all the best mothers and fathers who ever lived ( think about that for a moment) -- all the goodness , kindness , < PROPFEMALE > , wisdom , tenderness , strength and love -- and united all those virtues in one person , that person would only be a faint shadow of the love and mercy in the heart of God for you and me . 
Poptarts- Lard in a box !!!!!!! :P

God above all the world in motion , \ 
God above all my hopes and fears , \ 
Well I don't care what the world throws at me now , \ 
It's gonna be alright ! \ 
Hear the sounds of the generatorions , \ 
Making loud our freedom song , \ 
All in all that the world will know Your name , \ 
We're gonna be alright ! \ 
Cause I know my God saved the day , \ 
And I know His word never fails , \ 
And I know my God made a way for me , \ 
Salvation is here .
