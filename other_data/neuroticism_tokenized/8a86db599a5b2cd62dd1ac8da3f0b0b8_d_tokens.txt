HEADACHE . 

This is my new status , because I was told to change it . I'll be on PW . ~ 
I AM < PROPFEMALE > . THEREFORE I ROCK . Imeanwhat ? 
Have I said lately how much I hate Finals ? NO ? WELL THEN . I really friggin` hate Finals . ):< 
You know . Isn't it fun when people can instantly hate you , despite hardly knowing you ? Apparently it is a crime to know someone when said hater is crushing on them . Not my fault they like me better . ~ 
The itsy-bitsy spider crawled in from the sun . Crept into the crib , and found the baby bun . Baby kept-a cryin ' , til momma's work was done . And the itsy-bitsy spider crawled back out in the sun . 
The itsy-bitsy spider crawled into momma's bed . Crawled up on her hubby , and bit him in the head . Momma lay there sleepin ' , while hubby lay there /dead/ , and the itsy-bitsy spider crawled outta momma's bed . 
GNDSKJGBDSK ; UGTDSBNSKJ ; HSISNDFSNJFDS ; HFDS . Yeah . See . What now . 
Okay yes . I'm alive . I'm not social . We all understand this , yes ? SO DON'T BE SURPRISED IF I DON'T GO OUT IN PUBLIC A LOT . Jeeze . And stop sending < PROPFEMALE > after me , too . ):< 
Not wearing . :D 
I CAN'T GET WRESTLING OFF MY MIND . OMG . Love it so hard . 
As I lay me down to sleep , I pray my soul is mine to keep . And never step outside this bed , until all evil's back from the dead . 
I AM NEVER AGREEING TO HELP MY MOM CLEAN OUT HER DESK AT WORK AGAIN . NEVER . NEVER EVER EVER EVER . Unless money is involved . WHICH IT WASN'T . 
GOD . I need someone to rage with me on wrasslin ' . +__+ ; 
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall . Humpty Dumpty had a great fall . All the < PROPMALE>'s horses and all the < PROPMALE>'s men couldn't put Humpty together again . So they made egg salad . Cuz egg salad is good . Sometimes . 
You know . There's things in life that you just hate doing , no matter what . Yet people consistently ask it of you , DESPITE them knowing that you DON'T like doing that . Even when you try to tell them you don't like doing those things , all they do afterwards is complain and urge you on , and you feel forced in the end for doing that one thing you hate , because they're your friends and demanded it of you . 
I CANNOT BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED ON < PROPMALE > RUMBLE . Edge hasn't been around in FOREVER , so he just comes out at number thirty and WINS THE RUMBLE ? FFFF . If he turns Face , I'll be pissed off . Then again , I guess it doesn't matter since he's just going to lose at WrestleMania anyway . |: 
Something really gross happened to me last night ... I don't think I slept right after it . LOL . 
Song of the Month ; You must leave me behind , though the night howls inside you . You must fly high into the storm , far from the light - you must be strong . Because they need you . Because I love you . You close your eyes ... now ... and I will be gone ... but my love for you , will go on ... 
MY PHONE . SUCKS . LIKE SERIOUSLY ? SERIOUSLY . So does my LAPTOP -- technology just hated me this weekend . YAY FOR ME ! :D FML . ? 
That's when we ride on bitches ! Fuckin ' faggot snitches ! Don't fuckin ' try , we're packin ' 9s , we leave you dead in ditches ! ~ Ahh , Hollywood Undead . My new favorite band . 
You got your rules and your religion , all designed to keep you safe . But when rules start getting broken , you start questioning your faith . I have a voice that is my savior . Hates to love , and loves to hate . I have a voice that has the knowledge , and the power to rule your fate . I hear voices crying . I see heroes dying . I taste blood that's drying . I feel the tension rising . -- Voices ( Rev Theory ) 
I can't believe it ! Mr. President had an affair with Mrs. < PROPFIRST > ! Hoooooly shit , son . 
Not gonna be in m'house all day . Elimination Chamber , baby . ;D Cell phone's off , so you won't be able to contact me . BE BACK ON MONDAY . 
I'M SO PISSED . Elimination Chamber was SUCH a disappointment -- Well not really . I CAN'T BELIEVE HBK GANKED ' TAKER . So mad . There goes his < PROPMALE > at Wrestlemania -- unless Edge decides to fight him , which I doubt . ):< CONSIDERING HE ISN'T THE CHAMPION ANYMORE . Guh . I'm going to bed . 
I'm in school . Yeah . So like . I shouldn't be on here , but I am . B < Emina's here too , yeah . We're being a bunch of idiots . Kinda . B < She likes rabbit poop . Apparently . GO FIGURE . 
DID YOU GUYS KNOW ... IDK . D8 My niece's birfday is comin ' up soon . Yay for more annoying 60+ people parties that I don't know ! 
They all want my rad bromance . But they can't have it , oh no-no-no . D; Well . Maybe some of them can . :3 
Okay so . Emina just randomly asked the guy sitting next to me to move from where he was sitting , because she wanted to sit next to me . RETARDED . SRSLY . But I laughed a long time . 
V:< This game rocks my socks . 
STOP DOING THOSE DAMN CHAIN THINGS ON ME . I hate them . I : < 
NFDSKJLFNDSJFDSNFDSJKBDSKFDFSNDFSKJ . Message of the day . Try to pronounce it and I'll call you loser of the fuckin ' year . 
... I lost my mouse . QQ There goes my laptop's video games . GONE FOREVER . Until I find a new mouse -- BUT GODDAMN IT . Also , tanning every day sucks . = 3 = ; 
Status for 4/20 ; Blowin ' a joint and livin ' the life . Live chill , all . 
WORD OF THE DAY ? Porn . 
Gaah . Working on a new story - just finished the prologue . Gonna send it in to my awesomest BETA EVER , < PROPFIRST > . Hopefully everything works out fine . Going to sleep now though . z z ; Work on chapter one in the morning . 
Ugh . Why do people bother writing or typing anymore ? The majority have absolutely NO literacy skills , and make mistakes on the SIMPLEST of words . I don't get it . THE WORLD IS JUST FULL OF ILLITERATE ASSHOLES . :( 
Status for the damn year ; Waitin ' for that 2 0-0 record , baby . Undefeated streak for life . (~º¬º)~ 
I'm sick of tornadoes . THEY'RE NOT FUN AT ALL . 
I lie here , paralytic , inside this soul . Screaming for you ' til my throat is numb . I wanna break out -- I need a way out ; I don't believe that it's gotta be this way . The worst is the waiting -- in this womb , I'm suffocating . ~ Rebirthing 
This is all I know about Code Geass , despite my picture ; NECKRAMP . < PROPFEMALE > knows what I'm talking about . D:< 
The necks of this youth with their necks through this noose ; we're told lies like it's truth , and we suspect that it's you . So you strap them with the AK , it's mother fuckin ' mayday . They swear I'm fuckin ' crazy , ain't nothin ' gonna save me . My God I keep bleeding . I watch the world die from crimson eyes . I cry , it hurts tonight . I die , I see the light . And now I'll say goodbye . 
You can't make up your mind-mind-mind . Please don't waste my time-time-time . I'm not tryin ' to rewind-wind-wind . Cuz shawty is a eenie meenie miney mo lova . 
You too , my mother , read my rhymes . For love of unforgotten times , and you may < PROPMALE > to hear once more ; the little feet along the floor . ~ < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Stevenson [ ? ] Happy Mothers Day ! [ ? ] 
? ? ? [] I am OFFICIALLY single . About time . [] ? ? ? 
Oh life . \ 
\ 
Has it really gotten to the point where people are wearing < PROPFIRST > Cullen images on their CAR ? \ 
Curse you Twilight , and your gay sparkling \vampires \"." 
I love having < PROPFEMALE > in between for once . ;) 
\Look daddy ! \ " -- \ 
Thanks for the birthday wishes , guys ! :) 
Midgets . 
I probably should have said this a long time ago , but my phone's broken ( thanks to < PROPFEMALE > ) , so if you've been texting/calling ( like I know a certain someone has ) , then I haven't gotten them . It's been broken for a while now , and I kept telling myself to say it here , but I always forgot . I need to get a new battery , so until then , just a heads up . \ 
ALMOST BACK TO SCHOOL TIME , WHOO ! 
This was my conversation with < PROPFEMALE > over the phone :\ 
School , jobs , future careers , religion , strip clubs , parents , sex , Jurassic Park , Facebook , repeat . It goes in that order . Every day . 
And apparently I'm going to marry a < PROPMALE > black football player , and she's going to marry the < PROPMALE > white hockey player , and we're going to murder our husbands . Or the other way around . We have funny conversations , I guess . 
I was surprised to learn that \woman\ " spelled backwards was \ " kitchen\ " . Amazing what you find out ! " 
Had an awesome time with an old friend . KEEP IT REAL < PROPMALE > , you're one of my best . Lol . 
? SummerSlam tonight . ? \ 
? Here's to hoping it doesn't blow . I hope < PROPMALE > gets crushed by Kane . ? 
My internet fucking blows harder than Moby < PROPMALE > . This is retarded . 
Yes , getting a new battery for my cell phone soon . ' Bout time . 
So , just found out that a fantastic authoress I know almost quit writing . Just one thing to say to that : HATERS GONNA HATE , BABES . \ 
I'm glad she didn't quit . I would've had to slap a lady if she did . * You know who you are . * 
Profile picture change is related . \ 
|: 
I'm gonna kick < PROPFIRST>'s ass if he keeps posting those \Friend Question\ " things to me . \ 
Stop sending me invites to shit . God ... 
I'm still getting them . I blame you , Love . 
... All right . < PROPFIRST > , stop sending me invites . 
Look at your status , now back to mine , now back to yours , now back to mine . Sadly , yours isn't mine . But if you stopped posting about other things and made this your status , yours could be like mine . Look down , back up . Where are you ? You're on Facebook , reading the status your status could be like . I'm on a laptop . 
< PROPFEMALE > and I are having a debate about religion to the highest degree . If she had to give birth to the anti-Christ , and it was due to Satan , she says that God should punch Satan in the face . Really hard . I say that it calls for God to give Satan a punch in the crotch . \ 
That is all . \ 
P.S. Don't talk to me about religion . 
Whoever thinks I'd ever go bungee jumping is crazy . 
Damn you college , for not being closed . 
R . I . P RedDawn . Shit was fun while it lasted . \ 
This message has been belated by a few months ( or more ) . Hopefully Dogma will last longer ! \ 
Sorry about all that happened , Fatal . :( Quinne's psycho . 
Dramadramadramadramallamallamallamadramadramadrama . Sick of it . 
I love it when people act like a < PROPMALE > to you for no reason for three days straight , don't tell you what the hell is the matter , and then try to apologize for it later like the entire incident will be wiped from the slate . Hell to the no it won't , and I'm about to start some shit now . The ' who's a bigger < PROPMALE>' game has finally begun . 
To : AJ , < PROPMALE > , and Thomas\ 
You guys are good friends . Thanks for lifting me from the shit-hole . ? 
Youve got to be kidding me . Ive been further even more decided to use even go need to do look more as anyone can . Can you really be far even as decided half as much to use go wish for that ? My guess is that when one really been far even as decided once to use even go want , it is then that he has really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like . Its just common sense .
