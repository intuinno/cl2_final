the average low income adult spends $35 a month on lottery tickets for which they will never win anything .

A Seahawks fan , a Steelers fan , & a Patriots fan are climbing a mountain & arguing about who loves their team the most . The Patriot fan insists that he is the most loyal . '' This is for New England!'' he yells & jumps off the mountain . Not to be outdone , the Seahawks fan is next to profess his love for his team . He yells \This is for Seattle\ " & pushes the Steelers fan off the mountain . Repost if you're a Seahawks Fan ! "
