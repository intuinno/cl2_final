That's right . . . GO BRONCOS . . . 5-0 !!!! 
GO < PROPMALE > !!!!! 6-0 
So I'm stealing this from my cuz . . . but it's too good to not pass on : 1 ) Scroll to the bottom of your Facebook < PROPFEMALE > . 2 ) On the bottom left corner , click English : US . 3 ) When the language selection appears , click English : Pirate . 4 ) watch what happens . PURE AWESOME !!!
