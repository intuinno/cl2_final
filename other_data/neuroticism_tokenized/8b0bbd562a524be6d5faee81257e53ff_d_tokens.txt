Great moment's are born from great opportunities 
Training for a October 2nd Duathlon has proven more difficult than what I have thought . 
Yesterday is history , tomorrow is a mystery , but today is a gift . That is why it is called the present 
Nothing is impossible , for the word itself said I'm possible . 
Ran 6 < PROPMALE > in 58 minutes and bike rode 15 < PROPMALE > in a 1:15:23 . I hope I’m ready for my first duathlon this saturday .

Duathlons are not easy to finish 
Registration is complete for the 2011 Ironman 70.3 Steelhead ( 8/14/11 ) . I feel like I have just made a deal with the devil . 
An Ironman is a lifestyle ; train like there is no finish line . 
After climbing a great hill , one only finds that there are many more hills to climb . < PROPMALE > Mandela 
I think a man does what he can , until his < PROPFEMALE > is revealed .

To everyone who is calling for stricter gun laws in light of the tragedy in Tucson , may I offer this little tidbit : If guns kill people , then pencils misspell words , cars drive drunk , and spoons made Oprah fat ! Remember : Hold the person accountable for their actions , not the means they chose to utilize !!! Repost if you agree

< PROPFEMALE > , there is no appeasement . 
On average , homeowners pay $1.36 a day to fund a full time Fire Department including salaries and benefits . If you have a smart phone you pay on average $3.33 a day for your phone . That phone won't save your life , perform CPR , protect your property , transport you to the hospital in an emergency , etc . Copy and paste to your status and encourage everyone to support their local Fire Department 
Heading to a party and the keg goes dry :( . 
A man who views the world the same at fifty as he did at twenty has wasted thirty years of his life . \

KID rock this saturday 
Yes we remember < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > , a man with faith no man could shake . A strength no man could break . A character no man could fake . For goodness sake , let's eat some cake 
If you always put limit on everything you do , physical or anything else . It will spread into your work and into your life . There are no limits . There are only plateaus , and you must not stay there , you must go beyond them . \
