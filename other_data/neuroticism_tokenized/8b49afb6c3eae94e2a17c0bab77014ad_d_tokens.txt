Oo I lied , two hours . Sweet , first class at 11 = <33 
pretty much loving the weather and the fact that I don't have any more classes until 4.45 
music department meeting then nothing the rest of the day ... wtf free time ? 
don't want to sound stereotypical , but I fear I must , cus I miss my baby <33 
DIDN'T hate music history today . Hooray ! hour break then calc , then nothing until 5ish . Exploring ? Perhaps . 
so we pretty much made the entire 5th floor of < PROPMALE > into a trance party . jealous much ?

less than 48 hours . 
less than 24 hours . 
loves being tagged in < PROPFEMALE > Garcia's status <33 
so ask me what I did tonight . 
you don't even understand how angry I am that my class overlapped with the House premiere and I have to wait until TOMORROW to watch it online . 
have the wrong calc book AGAIN . grasghsjkghadfgdfa . surrendering , officially . inevitably going to suck ass at the easiest class in the world because I can't do the stupid homework . 
just accidentally exited out of 18 tabs on firefox ... fuck . 
so I never really made it to sleep . Decided giong to a diner in the city at 2am was a good idea . Met some interesting people on the PATH , watched a movie on a laptop in the diner , overall successful night/morning . 
lololol possibly best weekend ever ? 
I just lost the game . 
1.94 pints of cum is the current world record for amount swallowed . i could totally beat that . 
I fucking love my friends . 
fuck programming . 
less than 24 hours until my early-ass-fucking train gets into Beach <33 
I love having no class today . 
if anyone has skype , add me ! : twitcherific 
grarggg feel like shit , not going to class today . Sitting in Thompson's room reading MLIA ? Pretty much . 
sitting outside in the cold while I'm sick ? probably not the best idea . talking to tylerlove on trilian , then hopefully doing this essay that was due 2 weeks ago . go college ! 
wow , Thompson . Not too creative , eh ? Revenge will be sweet ... and witty . 
hookah outside of < PROPMALE > . 
finally working on that music history essay ? possibly . drinking < PROPFIRST > Adams Octoberfest ? fuck yes . once again : I love college . 
musictech midterm bullshit tonight ; cramming for that , figuring out an epic halloween costume , mehh ... too much shit to do . 
kekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekekeke ^_^ 
what the fuck , Thompson . Way to change my status AGAIN . I DECLARE WAR . 
Polacks are a lie . 
forgot about how amazing emulators are . 
Remember , remember the 5th of November . The gunpowder , treason , and plot . I know of no reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot . 
sitting by a fan while wearing contacts is probably a bad idea . Eyes < PROPFEMALE > dry >.< 
not enough sleep >.< ... Music History test , then back to sleep , cus I'm a music < PROPMALE > , and everyone knows we don't actually do work . 
< PROPFEMALE > is spiting me for yesterday's status . Way too much shit to do : Tech guys to fix a program , voice lessons , student services , < PROPMALE > lab , class , train . fml . 
donedonedonedoneee with my week ! To < PROPFIRST>'s tonight , waking up early as shit to register for classes , then who knows . =] 
Vive y dejar vivir . Pero , el amigo as < PROPFEMALE > condon en el bolsillo . 
no one's online this goddamn early for me to rant to >.< 
It goes in one ear , and right out the other ; I'm only playing music cus you know that I love it . 
homee btw . well , at least at < PROPFIRST>'s , which is pretty much home , anyway . bonfire , sleepover with my loves , game in the morning , then TWO thanksgiving dinners , and finally REST , lol . 
Breathe out , so I can breathe you in ... and hold you in . 
back at school at ~ 6.30 ... beginning the countdown to winter break >.< 
fuck music tech ... for the 4th time in a row ... umm yeah . intelligent decision . 
< PROPFEMALE > close to being done . one night , then one day , 3 classes , then happiness <33 
I like how half of my room is going to be a fort in the near future . This is what happens when < PROPFEMALE > has to study <33 
because cool kids say ' bro ' so it rhymes with ' s<PROPFEMALE>' 
Watched 11 episodes of Lost over the last 24 hours . New obsession ? I'd say so . 
how I wish ; how I wish you were here . We're just two lost souls , swimming in a fishbowl year after year . 
DO NOT FUCKING UNDERSTAND HOW REASON FUNCTIONS . fuck music tech . I'm gonna be the only person ever to switch FROM music TO engineering at this rate >.< 
because the weekend before finals is a good time to decide to stay up until past 4 playing flash games >.< kinda done with the whole ' school ' thing right about now . 
is actually accomplishing something ... wow . I'm gonna say it's thanks to CKY filling my room with sexy vocals and angsty guitar . new favorite band ? ... possibly ! 
\I'm in a toasty mood ! \ " - < PROPFEMALE > Nguyen " 
I guess it's good that I already accepted that I'm going to fail my music history final . Also : skyline looks amazing at 6.30 am , but I'm bitter that I had to wake up early enough to find this out . 
Typing an essay for my exam ?... and just became a fan of a < PROPFEMALE > during my Communications final , after being INSTRUCTED to go on facebook . THIS IS MY LIFE . 
hahahahahaha . umm packing , studying , life is pretty good . Infected mushroom makes a lot of sense right now . and no , I'm not on acid . <3333333 
slept from 6pm-2am then 7am-11 . Clearly I lead an extremely interesting life . 
playing flash games while watching < PROPFIRST > play Fallout 3 . Next : snack + LotR TT . Umm life's pretty chill right now . Thanks , snow . 
it's like a rule that every time I get something pierced , EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD has to smack into it the next day . >.< ear = pain , but adorable , haha 
Happy fucking new year , bitches <33 
\I always wanted to be a shipbuilder . \"" 
wideee awake since 8 in the morning . maybe this ' getting up for class ' thing won't be as hard this semester .

I AM OFFICIALLY NO LONGER FRIENDS WITH < PROPFIRST > THOMPSON BECAUSE HE IS A SMARTASS DOUCHEFUCK .

\the highest form of patriotism is to be skeptical of the official truth . \"" 
does anyone in the general Hoboken area have a spare calculator I can borrow for a couple weeks ? 
my new hobby is taking the ball out of my lip ring and flipping the ring upside-down . 
I find it unfortunate that 80% of the time since this semester started that I'm at school , I've felt like shit . Probably not going to Quijong , probably going to sleep >.< 
To see you when I wake up is a gift I didn't think could be real . To know that you feel the same as I do is a three-fold , Utopian dream . You do something to me that I can't explain , so would I be out of line if I said \I miss you \"?" 
I am officially celebrating my 10th Martian birthday on June 1st . 
I have way too much free time ; anyone care to suggest some good TV shows for me to download ? =P

They're NOT horses , they're unicorns .

THANK < PROPMALE > for soybeans ... so tasty ! 
I love days when it's socially acceptable to wear WAY too much green eyeshadow . 
< PROPFEMALE > close to spring break ! I just wanna get the fuck out of here . 
GETTING ICE CREAM WITH < PROPFEMALE > CUS WE'RE COOL LIKE THAT .

Every Afternoon Dirty Goats Bite Eachother 
just made fliers to put up in the neighborhood ... because dammit , if I can't get a real job , maybe I can at least convince people that I can be useful ! 
just seriously listened to Relapse for the first time ... holy shit , it's actually an amazing album . oh , and fuck you , I love Eminem . 
I should probably , like , go home sometime soon . Maybe today ? Still have fliers to put up , and an interview at < PROPFEMALE>'s Secret tomorrow ! =]

only good part about everyone leaving for school : I get to see people post things like , \just got done with classes for the dayy !! \ " when I've just woken up . "

freaking out because my baby the Arbiter is finally fully functional again , with a brand new hard drive and charger =] oh , and also cus I get to see some cool kids this weekend <33 
honestly , this has pretty much just been a good weekend so far . 
It's gotten to the point where my dreams are so vivid , that when I wake up , I can't really tell what's real . 
aparently I've been playing Fallout with my laptop on ' Power Saver ' for the last few days . Perhaps my makeshift cooling system was not as necessary as I thought . 
Love hurts , but sometimes it's a good hurt , and it feels like I'm alive . 
hurt my fucking back and I still have one full < PROPMALE > project and half of another left to do for tomorrow morning . fuuuuun . 
cannot even DESCRIBE how excited I am about this weekend <33 
Groovy uv .

I don't have work until Saturday . what the fuck am I supposed to do with all of this newly-acquired spare time ?! 
just bought a 2 terabyte external hard drive . Good use of scholarship money ? I sure as hell think so . =] 
stayed up late enough for the infomercials to start up on comedy central for the third night in a row . fuck the infomercials .

okay , facebook . first you force me to change to the new profile , then you DELETE my ' quotes ' then you make me change my languages like 5 times before it sticks . fuck you . 
is it bad that 4am's actually the earliest I've gone to sleep in the past couple weeks ? 
probably spending my entire day playing new vegas . who says being sick has to be a bad thing ? 
why have I basically been sick for 2 weeks straight with like 4 different things ? fuck the winter . 
occ all day , class at 2 , 3.30 , and 6.30 . brb killing self . 
seriously , I have to at least start TRYING to get to sleep before 4am . 
sometimes I can't tell if it's vertigo , or sleep deprivation . 
I am wearing a Plaxico jersey . I am the epitome of class . 
apparently walking around at 2 in the morning in the rain is frowned upon by Brielle cops . that or < PROPFIRST > Lumberjack Smith and I are just suspicious .
