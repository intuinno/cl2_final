I can do whatever I want whenever I want because I'm my own boss

Madussas 
This is the point from which I could never return\ 
And if I back down now then forever I burn\ 
This is the point from which I could never retreat\ 
Cause If I turn back now there can never be peace\ 
This is the point from which I will die and succeed\ 
Living the struggle , I know I'm alive when I bleed\ 
From now on it can never be the same as before\ 
Cause the place I'm from doesn't exist anymore

See , breaking up it's hard to move along it's even harder\ 
It's over she got colder now can't locate where her heart is\ 
And I'm just being honest , since we not even talking\ 
My mind won't let you go\ 
She even consider stalking na\ 
You know I be teasin ' no\ 
You know that my ego won't\ 
Thought this was forever love\ 
Guess that was just seasonal\ 
She got back with her old boy\ 
She's probably had a reason though 
so gettin to the point where i either gotta start growin my hair out again or buzz it again 
a drop in the ocean a change in the weather i was prayin that you and me might up end up together its like wishing for rain as i stand in the dessert but im holdin you closer than most cuz you are my heaven 
i wanna love ya and treat you right i wanna love ya every day and every night 
i wanna quit ... 
Whenever you need me \ 
Whenever want me , \ 
You know you can call me , I'll be there shortly \ 
Don't care what your friends say , cause they don't know me \ 
I can be your best friend , and you be my homie \ 
I ain't gonna flex , I'm not gonna front \ 
You know if I ball , then we all gonna stunt \ 
Send her my way , she ain't gotta hold up \ 
Whenever you call baby I roll up
