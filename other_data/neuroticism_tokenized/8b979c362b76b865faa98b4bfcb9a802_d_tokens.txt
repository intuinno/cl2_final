I graduated early peoples ! Just like to remind you i'm 16 and was a < PROPMALE > and now no senior year for me !!!! I'm so happy . Anyone else ? Huh , huh . 

I don't have an attitude problem , you just have a perception problem 
Don't read this . STOP READING THIS ! Why are you still reading this ? Okay , if you're stupid , keep reading this . Still reading this ? I thought you were a bit messed up in the head . 
I'm sick of saying short people can't kick butt ... YES WE CAN !!!! It's all we can reach :P 
I just lost rock-paper-scissors to my brother ... So , I think he should hold a piece of paper in front of his face . I'll throw a rock at him . THEN if he can still tell me paper beats rock , I'll say he truly won ... :) P . S ... I'm an AWESOME big sister . 
Happy Thanksgiving guys :)
