Hello everyone , and < PROPFEMALE > Christmas to you too < PROPFEMALE > ! It has been a long time since I ' ve seen all of you . Your pictures bring back many wonderful memories that I shared with all of you . I just wish I could've stayed just a little longer . Anyway , with all the the time I've been gone , I've reached my decision to pursue my dream of becoming one of the worlds greatest composers . 

Hello everyone , I just came back from work . Hours are horrible , but the pay is good enough to get the job done . I'm stuffed still from Christmas dinner ; yet still hungry , too weird . I took a little trip to hastings today , it's where I usually go to write my music . If you want to see me , you can catch there tomorrow at 4:00 P.M. sitting in the Hardback cafe . 
Are any of you guys reading manga at all ? I'm totally hooked on this new series called Fruits Basket by Natsuki Takaiya . It's really the kind of romance story I like ; although , it kind strange that it was written for girls . Regardless , I don't think it's such a bad thing to express your feelings every once in awhile . Love is no exception , but I guess that's me just being too sensitive . 
The Bach Festival starts next week . I'm going to chopin's dedication at < PROPFEMALE > college on june 11th . That's his 200th birthday . 
I find little solace in bach , beethoven , ect . when the man in front acts like a windmill . We are pilots , not servants . 
Famous quote : \ One does what one is ; one becomes what one does . \""
