Obligatory Gamer FaQuiz : Have you ever called in sick to work to play a videogame ? and if so , which one ? ... If you haven ; t ... have you ever been tempted to ? 
It's amazing how little you get done when you have to go out and pick up dead people at all hours ... 
In response to my wife's witty , yet irreverant prompt on \If you woke up in a jail together using only 4 words\ " . I'd like to invite everyone to write : An irreverant prison Hai-ku ! " 
I like my coffee , like i like my women : 
For all of the mutual friends of < PROPFEMALE > Perkins and I , She had an issue where her facebook account deleted some of her friends . If you got a message from her saying she deleted you from her list , know that it was not an intentional act and please send her a friend request if you can . 
< PROPFEMALE > X-mas all ! 
New Year's resolutions , anyone ? 
If smoking gives you cancer ... what gives you puppies ? 
Sweet ... Sweet procrastination .... must ... get ... back to work ... 
Invulnerable immortality ... Eternal blessing , or inescapible curse ? 
If < PROPFIRST > was so nimble and < PROPFIRST > was so quick ; It would have been slightly more fun to watch < PROPFIRST > dodge traffic 
So ... Apparently , and I think this is kind of odd , several of the * casinos * here in < PROPMALE > City are offering H1N1 vaccintions ... ... I guess it beats the hell out of walgreens . :P 
A kid who is always up to party and have a good time --- Dude , I don't wanna go to that party unless < PROPFIRST > comes . /// I am not amused ~_~ 
Screw a whole bunch of everything ... 
I've had it up to here -----------------------------------------

Fear the Cheeseburger Conspiracy . They lul us into a placative state of minde with their meaty-cheesiness and then try to take over the eowlr when humanity is rendered powerless ; confined to their bathrooms . 
Good things come to those who wait ... which seems to be an agonizing , colloquial kick-in-the-pants for anyone that needs to stop worrying about the future . :p 
The World is Grey .

Abandon hope , all ye who enter here ... 
... Kidney stones suck ... 
When i grow up , i want to be a midget ! 
I think i might like to read a comic about a bi-polar Superman ... 
I thought kidney stones granted wishes ...? Oh , well , I've submitted my cosmic bug report , now I'm just waiting for a reply ... 
Facebook really seems to have less to do with my face , and more to do with my typing abilities ... 
I know it's just a sign of our times , but is it oddly surprising to anyone else that PEZ has a webzite ? ( www.pez.com ) 
No matter how hard you scrub the port-o-potty of life , inevitably , someone's going to crap in it ... 
When one is on the precipace of change , who would know it would be the last step that is the most difficult ...
