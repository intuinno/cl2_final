I am getting ready to go shop for supplies to make auto safety kits for the Webelos ! ( I am an assistant leader for my boy's pack ) 

Yay , so I got my husband to get on facebook . Welcome mister . 
I have had the last four days off , and it has been so nice ! Went to my son's first football game , played some WoW , then went on a shopping spree with my daughter and 3 of her friends and my son , fun fun ! This morning is back to work though , sigh ... have to have SOME way to pay for all the fun I guess . 
I guess if anyone is interested , they can just copy and paste and do their own list ... lol 
three times .... jeesh ! at least I learned something . 
The evening sky is lavender and orange ... I love sunsets . 
So , I got to go to Kansas City for four days with my sister . We visited my brother , yay ! It was pretty around there , hilly and colorful with fall splendor ! 
Thank you to all the new Castle Age Friends who have joined my army ! Let us kill hydras and dragons ... muahahahah ! =) 
Ok , it's official . I have 11 days to move out of my home of 10 years and into our new house ! It is really happening now . =) 
This Christmas has been rather chaotic at my house , but I wish blessings of happiness upon all of my loved ones in the coming year .... <3 
Today we have been in our new home barely one week ! I am feeling much happier about it now that I things are getting to be in their places . I plan to have some photos to post here soon ! =) 
Worked a 10 hour day today ... going to catch a few zzzz's ... good night my people !

\Hey Soul Sister\ " by Train ... is happy making ! =) "

Attention Castle Age friends , just so you all know : I have just now changed my Castle Age name to {{ Firestar }} 
I am soooo excited !!! I got my tickets to go see U2 in SLC in June ! YAY ! =D 
Look back and thank God . Look forward and trust God . Look around and serve God . Look within and find God ! God closes doors no man can open and God opens doors no man can close . If you need God to open some doors for you ... Repost . 
The snow has slowly been disappearing ... today I went in my yard and was able to rake the edges of my poor , flattened grass ... ruffled it up good ! I could smell the earth and the plants for the first time in many weeks . There was a little sunshine , I didn't have to wear a coat ... spring is flirting with us !

You were the last person required to summon the Firestorm . The Firestorm has now launched and inflicted 28200000 damage to Cronus , The World Hydra ! I LOVE BEING THE ONE WHO LAUNCHES THE WEAPON ! hehehehe 
What's on my mind is I would like a day off work ... again soon . One per two weeks is insufficient . =/ 
Hello people ! =) 
My amazing daughter just won first place at Regional History Fair for individual performance ! State History Fair , here we come ! Hooray < PROPFEMALE > !!! =D 
A girl without freckles is like a night without stars ..... 
Thank you to all the kind people who have wished me a Happy Birthday ! <3 you all tons !! 
Isn't it strange how foods I found offensive as a child I now find most delicious ? Case in point : Pork ribs and saurkraut with mashed potatoes and butter ... mmmm . 
Reading a book .... quiet .... sleep .... these are good things . 
Well , yesterdays SNOW is mostly melted into the ground , so I am sure the spring bulbs appreciated the moisture ... I personally would appreciate rain more than snow at this time of year ! =) 
Good morning friends ! 
Never be bullied into silence . Never allow yourself to be made a victim . Accept no one's definition of your life ; define yourself . ~ Harvey Fierstein 
I have been enjoying my days off work during Spring Break ... the best thing of all was my sweet sister came and visited over the weekend ! 
I love my digital camera ... however , I think there are now probably a thousand pics that are on my computer but have not been developed ... =/ 
Today we went to Utah State History Fair . My daughter won 1st place in personal performance division against nine other competitors . National History Fair , here we come ! Wooo ! Good job < PROPFEMALE > ! 
I do not have anything exciting going on today ...

The air is starting to be filled with the scent of fruit tree blossoms and Lilac .... I love this about the Springtime . 
Following Bono's unexpected back surgery \ 
earlier today , Live Nation confirmed that the U2 360° tour launch\ 
previously scheduled for June 3rd in Salt Lake City has been \ 
postponed . Sadness .... =( I hope Bono heals quickly . 
I love tomato sandwiches . =) 
So , tomorrow morning at this time , my daughter and I will be on a plane heading to Washington , D.C. for the National History Day contest ! Woohoo ! Wish us luck and say a prayer for our safe journey please ! 
We are here safely . To U of < PROPFEMALE > this morn to get the lay of the land . 
Opening ceremony was last night . This is the 31st annual History Day National Contest . There are over 2500 contestants this year , the most ever . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > does her presentation at 2:00 today . I thought her backdrop things we mailed were big and a pain to ship here . After going to the shipment receiving room , and seeing the huge wooden crates others sent , I realize our things were not big or a pain ! Lol . 
Ahhh , sadness ...... Each < PROPMALE > category had close to 100 contestents ( two from each state ) . Only 10 finalists were chosen in each category . Utah , unfortunately , did not make the Finals in any < PROPMALE > category . =( However , two entries from each state will be chosen for being the outstanding entries from their state . Also , there is the < PROPMALE > to be chosen for a special award based on one's subject matter . 
Despite not making it to the final rounds , let me say this is still being an amazing experience and I am grateful to be here with my daughter . We are enjoying Washington , and learning the Metro system . We have visited the holocaust museum and the spy museum so far , as well as walking to the Washington monument and the reflecting pool , with the WWII memorial fountain . 
Today was really fun ! We went to Union Station , ate brunch , did a little shopping . It is a very busy place . Next , we walked through the National Zoo , got to see the pandas and an octopus ! After that , we walked up Cathedral ave , to the Washington Cathedral , which is breathtaking and beautiful ! On the way , there were old , very cool houses , and sweet-scented blossoming trees I am fairly sure were magnolias . I loved it ! 
The last day we were in Washington we went on a tour of the Capitol , and my daughter got to meet our State Congressmen , as well as get her picture taken with them . I would recommend < PROPFIRST > from Senator Hatch's office as a great tour guide ! < PROPFEMALE > Capener from Senator < PROPMALE>'s office was also very nice and helpful . We also did a quick breeze in and out of the National < PROPMALE > Museum , wish I had more time in there ! 
Finally home . I had fun in Washington D.C. , then I went to take care of my dad for a few days . It was good to visit with him , though I am a little distressed I had none of my off time to do my own personal things . ( my craft room is still a disaster ! ) 
Well , enjoyed seeing everyone this weekend , wish I would have had more time to spend ! Two bbq's in two days , and some fireworks with my friends and family last night . I hope everyone else enjoyed the holiday as well . =) 
PROMISE TO MY KIDS : I will stalk you , freak out on you , lecture you , drive you crazy , be your nightmare , embarrass you in front of your friends , hunt you down like a bloodhound until the day you understand why I do it . Then I'll know you're a responsible adult . All because I love you . You will never find someone who <3 loves <3 and cares about you more than your MOM ! Copy and paste if you feel the same 
LOVE MY SISTERWEEK ! If you have a sister who has made you laugh , wiped your tears , hugged you tight , watched you succeed , saw you fail , cheered you on and kept you strong , copy and paste this to your status . Sisters are a promise that we will have a friend forever ! Re-post if you have ... an ... Amazing Sister !! ?? 
I never knew how delicious Dill flavored sunflower seeds could be ! =P
