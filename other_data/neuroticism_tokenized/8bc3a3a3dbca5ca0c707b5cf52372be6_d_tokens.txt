Finally @ home in FLA left at 900 this morning got in about 730 this evening . That was the most boring drive ever , never thought I talked to myself that much & I guess neither did the guy in the car next to me . LOL , I'm on Va-K for a week OH YEAH !!!! 

Just got back from taking the kids to Lake City mall for their late xmas gifts .

Don't wanna go back out to sea just yet

Supposed to go to the CREED concert , but all I have to say is \Thanks Bill\ " . Hurricanes suck sometimes . " 
Ready for the ship to come back , I miss my friends . 
bored out of skull , is it the 28th yet ? 
Anyone can be a hero , but it takes someone extraordinary to change a life ....

Tired of being broken & around preggos . 
Almost died , we tried to go surfing @ VA beach , but the waves were huge & the undertow way too strong . But I'm OK ...

Thanks everyone for your support , I've been waiting to make 3rd for a long time . 
< PROPFEMALE > X-Mas < PROPFEMALE > , we don't have a tree this year but I'm pretty sure we don't need one to enjoy the holiday spirit . Although it would be nice to wake up to a big tree , it's the people you have to wake up & share the moment with that makes x-mas the greatest day . 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone , it doesn't feel like it but it's all about spending time with those closest to you ... Love you guys .... Happy Holidays 
Ok , so it's not so much < PROPFEMALE > here . But it's not my way to rain on anyone's parade , so I hope everyone has/had a great christmas .... 
OMG !!! WTF , Urban is leaving us ??? First Tebow's thinking about leaving us & now Urban , the GATOR NATION is not going to be the same . 
Hoping I can get my leave chit early tomorrow , I go on leave until the 11th , OMG finally a Va-K . FLA here I come 
Got my wish , I'm officially on leave now I can finally gets some R&R for the first time in a year ... 
Why can't friday come any faster ? 
HAPPY NEW YEAR !!! We brought in the new year w/ a few beers & a couple glasses of champagne , I love you guys ... 
You know how islanders cook underground ? Well , we just pulled a ham out of the ground after 24hours & he's still not done , almost but not quite . 
is about to go outside to sit by the fire & drink a few beers , brr it's cold here & I don't wanna go back to VA now , really starting to get used to being home again . So much stuff I miss doing . 
Ok so that had to have been both a good idea & a bad idea , ( good idea : fire was nice & hot ) ( bad idea:don't walk away from the fire , it's 28 degrees & lowering ) even a 100ft walk from the pit to the house is like a football field . But damn it I GOTTA PEE !!!! 
Well , I hate to say it but I leave for VA tomorrow starting early & don't wanna go back . Hell I don't even wanna walk outside it's too cold , I'm gonna miss not having to work . Why can't I stay for another week it went by too fast . 
Oh @least I'll make it back in time for the Texas/Bama game , not much for any other team but Florida but I hope Texas beats Bama , GO HORNS !!!! 
Up @0430 to see my momma off , still not ready to go but I think I'll have to manage . All good things must come to an end , a little upset cause I didn't get to see everyone I wanted to , maybe next time . Now for a long drive .... 
well , I'm back in VA got in around 4:30 pm now we're watching the Texas/Bama game & so far Texas is kicking ass . GO HORNS !!!! 
Well , Texas didn't win but they put up a damn good fight . McCoy was robbed in the 1st quarter , after all Bama was undefeated .... 
watched < PROPFEMALE>'s Body , made dinner & some kick ass drinks , ( vodka , lemon juice , pina colada mixer , more vodka , oj & a couple of < PROPFEMALE > canes ) it was definately an interesting mix . I guess you could say I'm trying new things this new year .... 
doesn't wanna go next week , I just wanna be a bum & stay around the house for a while . I'm starting to feel old , don't know how or why but I just am .... 
can we just stay home until the 8th , I'm a lazy bum I know this . Like I said I just wanna be a bum & stay around the house & maybe drink alot ... 
2 days before we pull in I tried to stop a hatch with my foot , yeah < PROPMALE > crutches & a splint it's awesome , NOT ... fun side of it is we got some snow lots of it 
It's not fractured or broken just some really bad bruising , I got a boot & more crutches just gotta go back to the boat to see what they wanna do with me ... 
OMG !!! How is it I get called a dork everytime I do something de-de-de , LOL ... 
Okay that's it , you know what I really hate ? I really hate fake people , why would you hide everything you believe in & how you truly feel to satisfy other people's needs . To be honest , I'm tired of being one of those fake people too , I don't need anyone else to bring me down , I CAN DO BAD ALL BY MYSELF !!!! 
Sooo sleepy for some reason , can't seem to stop being lazy . 
Is not going out to sea this week , call into work twice a day 0730 & 1230 for muster & I don't even have to get out of my pjs . Definately gonna be a bum & no one's is gonna stop me . Just wish my foot would stop hurting completely , still bruised & swollen in some places but it's ok 
bored , bored , bored , bored , bored .... I'm definately not a loner type person , I need human contact . I'm by myself until friday , let's just hope my ADHD doesn't get the best of me . LOL . 
bored yet again , went back to the hopital for more x-rays . Good news is Monday is my last day on crutches , unfortunately it hurts like hell to wear a regular shoe so another week I'm still wearing DAS BOOT . 
can't wait for my tax return ... 
tax return on friday . 
What is < PROPFIRST>'s Day ? It's a day when twitter-painted fools waste their money on < PROPFEMALE > , cards & other ridiculous things that will be thrown into a box & hidden away for who knows how long until someone someday comes across it . Yeah , I'm a V-Day lover .... 
Well , I'm alone @ the house again for another week & a half , I'm really starting to get used to this . @least I know I can make it on my own , it's ok though tax return on friday & payday next friday . OH YEAH double pay day .... I love taxes .... 
SIGH , I'M SO LONELY ... 
Got my new phone yesterday , got to work today & tomorrow Velez & I are going to get massages then < PROPFEMALE > & I are going to get our hair done . Busy , Busy , Busy .... but I can't wait .... 
Makeovers aren't just about changing your appearance , it's also about changing smaller things about yourself for the better .... 
Chillin on duty today , watching Moulin Rouge & ordering my mom flowers for her b-day on tuesday while waiting for tomorrow so I can go home & lay in my comfy bed .... SIGH , I miss my bed . 
doesn't know what to do , can't help but think that things are gonna go bad for some reason .... Is that ESP or am I just being paranoid ? IDK ... 
Gimme , Gimme , Gimme , so sick & tired of people always wanting stuff but never giving stuff . Can't wait for April to get here so I can get away from this state & these people .... 
Ok , so I'm over it already . I found a new relaxing technique to soothe my nerves , where has it been all of my life , I wish I would have found it sooner ... SIGH , so relaxed ..... 
Can't wait to get this story I'm writing finished , I've been working on it since 08 ' . Gees I'm such a procrastinator , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > ..... 
9 days out & then 15 days in florida , no duty until April 17th OH YEAH !!! Kickin ' it old school ...... 
Finally on leave , in Little Rock , AR now & havin an awesome time , I'll be in < PROPFEMALE > FLA on Tuesday . Never listen to cop in Tenn , they will literaly have you driving up a steep ass mountain in the pitch black dark . 
wanted to stay in Arkansas w/ my girl but couldn't now I'm flying to ATL as I speak will arrive in JAX around 7:30 tonight , thanks for all of the B-Day blessings . I might not be able to enjoy it right now , but I still have until the 15th . 
on my way to JAX FL & it's about time , had a 4 hour lay over in Atlanta . OMG MY ADHD , 
Finally home , turn a 2 and a half hour drive into about an hour and 15 mins . I guess that's what happens when you give me a dodge charger ... 
is so miserable right now , took the kids to Busch Gardens on friday for a QUAD-BDAY & it was awesome , they had to keep up w/ me . Then saturday went to Fort De Soto & Soto beach , I'm so sore right now . Oh & I'm the official spokesperson for Red Lobster , OMG am I burnt . Hey @least I'll be tan . Oh btw I wish I could be in Eureka , AR for oil wrestling ... 
Your sweet moon-beam , the smell of you in every single dream I dream I knew when we collided , you're the one I have decided who's one of my kind .... 
: is in JAX & got lucky , lady behind the booking desk didn't charge me 4 my bag . Thank God 4 good ppl . Seems that military w/ orders get free baggage claim , as 4 those of us who aren't w/ orders get charged an xtra $25 . How crazy is that , all military should get free baggage checks , HELL y can't they be like theme parks once a year military fly 4 free . NOW THERE'S AN IDEA , too bad no one will ever wise up & try it . 
says : If your MOM is your hero , whether you are blessed to have your MOM still with you , or if she is an Angel in Heaven , copy and paste this into your status and let everyone know you are proud of your MOM 
realizes that she spends way too much money on fast food & now it's time to save money for Cali , me & < PROPFEMALE > are tryin to make final decisons . Last night I helped make some awesome tacos now I'm gonna try & make a chicken meal that I put together for the first time , WISH ME LUCK .... 
IT WAS AWESOME !!!! Made a little too much sauce but it was definitely one of the best chicken recipes that I've ever made , now I have a little acid indegestion sauce was a little too spicy .... Wonder what I'm makin for dinner tomorrow night . Any ideas ???? 
If destruction be our lot we must ourselves be its author & finisher . As a nation of free men & women we must live through all time , or die by suicide . 
Light thinks it travels faster than anything but it's wrong . No matter how fast light travels , it finds the darkness has always gotten there first , and is waiting for it . 
Where you used to be , there is a hole in the world , which I find myself constantly walking around in the daytime , and falling in at night . I miss you like hell . 
Giving up doesn't always mean you are weak ; sometimes it means that you are strong enough to let go . 
“Love is patient , love is kind . It does not envy , it does not boast , it is not proud . It is not rude , it is not self-seeking , it is not easily angered , it keeps no record of wrongs . Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth . It always protects , always trusts , always hopes , always perseveres . ” [ 1 Corinthians 13:4 -7 , The Bible ] 
says : some of the greater things in life are unseen thats why you close your eyes when you kiss , cry , or dream . 
Going out to sea for 2 & 1/2 days , how freaking stupid . We're not even flying , well 1 more month till I'm off the ship & 2 more till I go on terminal leave & process out . Then Cali here I come ... 
We're back !!!! But sucky thing is I broke my phone , now I gotta wait til payday so if anyone needs to get ahold of me ur gonna have to fb me . Good news is May 17th I'm off of the ship , can't wait for July 8th terminal leave . Cali here I come .... 
I'm mad , not at you , but myself because whatever I do , whatever I say , I couldn't make you stay . 
I seem to find myself not so much smoking anymore but has turned to drinking more these days . Can't seem to get much sleep , from time to time rolls over in bed & reaches out to find that you are not there , still can't seem to get used to sleeping alone . Writing & drawing seems to be the only things I can focus on . Gotta get outta here soon , why can't June come faster ... ( SIGH ) 
Love the moment . Flowers grow out of dark moments . Therefore , each moment is vital . It affects the whole . Life is a succession of such moments and to live each , is to succeed . 
Live for today and not tomorrow , live for the now and what's here . Stop living for what maybe or what may never come , live for the day already here . 
Is it strange that a 23 y/o is rocking out to every < PROPFEMALE > Montanna episode on Disney Channel right now ???? 
says : showers are awesome , they're almost as good as sex , but better . When can you ever have sex whenever you want @ any time of day ? You can take as long as you please , get in & get out without having to hear any complaining or BS afterwards ... HAHA , just kidding . I LOVE SHOWERS !!!!!! :D 
has a craving for mayhem & destruction ... heehee , well maybe not so much mayhem but definately destruction . MUAHHAHA ... psst you're supposed to be scared , that was my evil devious laugh .... 
wants someone to snuggle with . 
Get caught in the race of this crazy life , tryin ' to be everything can make you lose your mind , I just wanna go back in time to American < PROPFEMALE > 
doesn't wanna get any older ... 
Watchin the Mayweather/Mosley fight now , nothing like the sight of testosterome to make me feel like throwing up . 
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars , I could really use a wish right . 
This one's for my homeboy that lost his everything , sorry < PROPMALE > I still love you ... \ADDICTED\ " Simple Plan I'm trying to forget that I'm addicted to you But I want it and I need it I'm addicted to you Now it's over Can't forget what you said And I never wanna do this again Heartbreaker " 
Hopefully I can get out of my last 3 duty days before I leave the boat . No duty @ AIRLANT or TPU , still don't know which one I'll be going to yet .... 
cannot wait until June but it's taking FOREVER !!!!! U need to hurry up & get here like yesterday . I miss u like hell .... 
is sooo ready to get out to Cali , & I know < PROPFEMALE > can't wait either .... I'm glad she's going with me so I won't have to be out there by myself , it's gonna be fun times . 
It's bullshit that my roommate has to go on deployment & I'm stuck here until July 8th . 
is tired of hurting so much , sometimes it just feels like I wanna go hide in a hole somewhere & just hibernate . 
All changes , even the most longed for , have their \ 
melancholy ; for what we leave behind us is a part of ourselves ; we must \ 
die to one life before we can enter another .

Can't help but think that now I CAN DO IT ! 
found out somewhat better news , I'm getting flown off the boat June 25th instead of July 8th . YAY , so only a month instead of a month & a half .

AHHH , I'm melting . I've never been so bored in my life , can someone bring me some land to go w/ all of this water that I can't drink or swim in . 
27 days & counting until I reach that US soil , 11 days until we hit Marsielle , < PROPFEMALE > . It's only be a week & it feels like it has been a month . All I can really say is , BLAH . 
25 days .... Everyday that gets closer is everyday I get more & more excited , get your stuff ready before July 9th JimBob b/c when I get down there to FL you have 4 days to say your goodbyes & what nots cuz we're heading out after that . Heads up Cali , We're coming over ... 
T-minus 23 days left on the HST , got my passport today & I'm ready to leave . Going through the Straight of Gibraltar tomorrow morning gonna try to get some good pics on the way . Missing the family & friends back in the states , but I will see you guys soon . 
16 days till I'm back in the states , halfway there just gotta < PROPFEMALE > in there . 
You know the fog horn sound you get when you blow on a beer bottle ? Well , it seems that you can create the same sound when you blow into someone's mouth , but the only thing is it takes skill b/c it's not that easy , lol . Just a random flashback . 
11 days until I'm state side , yay me !!!! Well , I guess I have 11 days to finish up the lyrics & music for my song . I forgot how long of a process writing is , blah . Just gotta keep my head above the water for another week & a half , wish me luck . 
9 days left(SIGH ) , almost there . So I was looking back on my last 4 & a half years in the navy & realized that I made a lot of friends while I was here both military & non . U guys have been my stepping stones , my drinking buddies & my family . Deep down I know I will truly miss u all very much , but I will keep in touch . I would like to say thank u all , u've helped me more than u know . I love u guys . 
Change of plans , not leaving for another 10 days then stayin in Bahrain for 3 or 4 days then I'm on my way back to the states . So they added a couple more days onto my stay , oh well @least after this I won't have to come back .... 
OMG , it's so freaking hot out here . I walk 20ft & break a sweat . I know , I know , I should be used to it being from FL & all but this is not the humid kinda heat it's dry as hell .... 
5 days left & I'm starting to get impatient , I don't know if this could take any longer or what ? 
Has come to the conclusion that maybe California might not be the right thing for me , so I'm deciding to move to Clearwater , FL somewhat closer to home & hey I always did love it down there . Guess we'll see how much I really do in a few months , 4 days left . 
for once in my career I'm the most relaxed , but I still can't wait to get to FLA . This life will end peacefully only to make way for a new & exciting life , the only thing that will remain are the people I know & love ..... 3 days 
Today's the day .... All my bags are packed , I'm ready to go . ' Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane I don't know when I'll be back again . Sorry , I thought this would be appropriate @ this time ... Count down is complete , there aren't any more HST days for me . I will miss you all . 
Well , I'm in Bahrain now . Nothing left to do but enjoy the cheap alcohol & Navy exchange . Wish I could just fly back to the states already .... ( SIGH ) it's 4:30 am here & I'm wide awake , blah .... 
just got back from the Hard Rock Cafe , bought some t-shirts for the kids & I'm still hungover but that's not gonna stop me from doing it again . 
Finally back in the states & only 2 more hours til I'm in Norfolk . I'm so jet lagged but hey it's 4th of July weekend . 
Never thought I'd be happy to see Norfolk again , oh well I have my truck & I have my phone that's all I need

I miss my killer , I've found myself kinda lost w/o her . This is the first time in about 3 years that I'm not gonna be able to yell from one room to the other or text from the other end of the couch while we're watching tv . Man this SUCKS !!!!

I think I'm dying , the pain has been moving up & down the left side of my body sometimes in more than one area @ a time for a few days now , but I'm too re-re to go to the docs .... Hard to sleep on my side lately . 
I do believe I am in love ... Emitt is gonna be the only \man\ " in my life for a while . " 
just left the hospital b/c the pain came back hard , now we're on our way to the Paramore concert @ ODU ..... 
Ok so the doc said that I have Paresthesia from popping my neck so much so he gave me fluids & put me on Naproxen , Flexeril & Vicodin . Talk about some good sleep . It's nothing too serious but it's definitely not good to have . I guess it's a good thing < PROPFEMALE > made me go to the doc's . Well , I'm in Pensacola now trying to find a job & a new apartment , wish me luck .... 
who knew that the He-Man Woman Haters Club started w/ 3 of the greatest guys of all time , < PROPFIRST > , Curly & Moe . I'm just chilin w/ my Emitt watchin the 3 Stooges marathon , but he wants to play w/ his cat-nip mouse . He's so ADD , I love it ... 
found some great apartments but still looking \ 
for a job , there's definitely work out here it's just that some are SO \ 
picky . IDK ( shoulder shrug ) , I'm sure to find something . I \ 
have hope & a lot of faith ....

is thinking\ 
that I should have went into work this morning , but yesterday we didn't\ 
get back until 8:00 pm . Went out to Niceville to make deliveries but \ 
only made two stops , so didn't bring much money in . Maybe Monday will be\ 
more promising .?. Well I'm gonna go out to West Florida Speedway to watch the races & have a couple of beers , WOO HOO I love stock car racing .... 
is going to bed to prepare myself for a long work week ... Gonna get up @ 7:30 , drink some coffee , eat a piece of toast then roll out . After almost 2 & a half months of not working & being an uber bum , I really don't wanna go ... 
Got\ 
so burnt today out at Pensacola Beach , but it'll make an awesome tan . \ 
Forgot what the Florida sun felt like , ( tear ) man I really missed it . 
Has the biggest urge to get pretty & go out to a club to dance & have a few drinks . Anyone wanna come with ??? LOL ... 
I have let my drunk texting get the best of me , if I text you on Saturday night I apologize b/c some of my texts were immature & uncalled for . 
Doing something that I haven't done in about 3 months , running 2 < PROPMALE > in 97 degrees , so I should be able to sweat of all of the beer belly I'm starting to get 
I'm so stressed out that I think I'm gonna go do some night swimming since it's cooler now , haven't been swimming @ night since May . 
When I was a kid , I tried to lie flat under a blanket during hide and seek . 
do you ever feel like no matter how hard you try to fix something , you only seem to make it worse ? I seem to have that problem , all I want to do is fix it , but fail miserably at it . In this case try , try again does not apply . Anyone got any useful advice they can lend me ? 
needs to definitely start working out so I can get back in shape , my arms , shoulders & upper back are good from all of the swimming , but gotta get those rock hard abs going . 
is volunteering @ Escambia County Animal Shelter , it's not a paying job \ 
but @least I get to interact w/ lost & abandoned animals . \ 
Plus I think I'm going to adopt one of the dogs there she's a beautiful 1 yo collie/retriever mix hopefully she'll still be there tomorrow . 
I couldn't sleep at all last night , IDK if I'm anxious or just really excited about getting the dog . Found myself driving to the store to fill up my gas tank @ 5 am , then came back & made myself breakfast . Think I might be sick or going insane , where's a doc when you need em ??? 
I love my new baby Kaylynn , she's such a sweetheart & she's so adorable .

is about to learn how to live on my own w/ a dog & a cat , this is gonna be one hell o'va ride . Now all I need is a couple pieces of furniture & a tv & I'll be all set . 
never realized how many pairs of shoes I had then I looked up & almost fell over when I saw so many clothes that I didn't know I had . 2 straight days of washing clothes & now I'd rather run around naked so I don't have to do laundry ever again . 
Ok so I started this new job today making $500+ a week only bad thing is I work Mon-Fri 9:30 am- 8:00 pm & Sat 9:00 am- 7:30 pm , why can't I just get a regular 9-5 Mon-Fri like a normal person . I hate work so long & on weekends too , it doesn't give me time to take care of anything , but until I start school a job's a job ... 
Can anyone suggest a good way to house train a 1y/o dog ?
