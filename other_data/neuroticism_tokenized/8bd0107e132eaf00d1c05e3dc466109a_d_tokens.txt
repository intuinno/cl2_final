Statuses are stupid . You can't exactly express anything you want to say cause people will either think you're bragging or whining -____- \ " , 2010-12-11 19:35:34 "

Have you ever noticed that only humans and dogs turn into zombies in movies ? Why don't they ever show fish zombies or cat zombies ? Wouldn't water first get contaminated , which means fish would become zombies first . And cats eat fish , so they would become zombies too .
