Wow , Happy New Year everyone . Oh , before I forget I just wanted to give a little update on my mom since coming home . She's feeling much better . Thank you so much for your wonderful emails . I'm happy to report that she's keeping food down and back to her old crusty self . lol When she fussed about the wrong < PROPFEMALE > Ale , I knew she felt better . 

Most exciting thing I've done is that I took a psychic test . You know , the one where you have to select which color is going to come up . I got ( 11 ) right out of 25 . Think I'll work on it everyday until I get all of them right . 
THANK YOU FOR ALL OF THE BIRTHDAY WISHES !!!!! 
Yesterday , my cutie-pie husband and I celebrated our 14th Wedding Anniversary . WOW , 14 years ! We had a wonderful dinner at Longhorn and < PROPMALE > was in bed asleep by 10:30 . How times have changed . lol He's always passing out before me . God love him . \ 
\ 
Due to the heat of the 2nd , we'll be continuing our celebration on Thursday . I hope it's cooled off by then . 
Why did God create man last ? Because had He created man first , man would take credit for creating the world . 
I haven't gotten a part yet . I just auditioned last night . And I probably didn't get it because once again I'm not old enough , or I'm not fat enough , or I'm to this , OR OR OR OR OR OR !!!!!! Right now , I'm just fedUP !!!! \ 
I'm good but no one seems to want me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
I WANT TO GO OUT FRIDAY ! WHO'S WITH ME ?! 
Another rejection for another play ! I put down to read for the character that's only 5-8 years older than me , but the director keeps having me read for a character that's 25 years younger than me . Then , when all is said and done , he ask if anyone wants to read something they didn't get the < PROPMALE > to read while in the same breath announcing he has a headace ! I open my email today and there's the rejection . 
The majority rules . I'll be wearing my beautiful cape Saturday night ! 
i just got home from our reunion . I HAD A BLAST ! However , my voice is gone . Can't wait to see everyone tomorrow at 2 .

Not at all proud of myself right now . I allowed myself to get angry over someone else making a comment regarding something that was just \my opinion\ " . This is what happens when someone thinks their opinion is more important than someone else's . I simply gave my opinion only to basically be told how wrong I was . " 
Being a Christian doesn't mean I'm super human and I'm not apt to getting ticked off and cursing like anyone else . I'm just as flawed as the next person . However , I'm certainly not proud of it . ( the cursing part)\ 
Okay , I'm off my soapbox and going to bed . 
I met a wonderful couple today , Mr. & Mrs. Tootie DeBenedetto , of Sweetheart Records in CT . He's a WWII Vet . He told me that no one cares about the vets anymore , just other vets . Broke my heart . I thanked him ! 
I challenge anyone who meets a vet at anytime to thank them . It doesn't matter if they served this country during WWII or Iraq . Please , take the time to thank them . Because without them where would we be ? 
I am officially online . 
I'm now going to work on my Stage Play . Should be done soon and I'll be looking for people to do an open reading of it . I really need to hear it to make sure it's right . \
