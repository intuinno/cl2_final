< PROPFEMALE > I'M SO PROUD OF YOU , KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK . 

Thank you ! everyone who wrote me , to wish me a happy birthday . As many of you know , my sister , Shavonn Hamilton-Clark , on my birthday , went home to be with the Lord . Please keep me and my family in prayer . This is a hard time for us , but God is a very present help . Thank you , and my God's favor shine upon all of you . 
This past Sunday at Church , one of our great elders , taught a sermon about hearing from the Lord with open ears . One of the scriptures he used was in < PROPFIRST > 1:22 But be ye doers of the word , and not hearers only , deceiving your own selves . Its funny because everywhere I go and whatever radio station I listen to , they all have quoted this scripture . Thats usually confirmation . So everyone do the word . 
Wishing , my mother , Missionary < PROPFEMALE > Ford , Happy Mother's Day . This dedication is for my mother and others who have lost a child or children , it is my prayer and < PROPFEMALE > for you , that the Lord will give you strength and < PROPMALE > you the < PROPFEMALE > s of your heart . Remember to pray for those mothers who have lost children . To all other mother's , or those who just help fill in the gaps , Happy Mother's Day to you all !!!!!!!

To all the Facebook family of women who want to make the transition from relaxed hair to natural hair . I found a great website site that offers advice on everything you need to know about making that transition . In addition they offer a variety of styles you can wear during and after you make that transition . It's call Nappturality.com 
Thanking God , for the Holy Spirit that reveal all truth . 
This is a very heartfelt and touching video with a message we can all learn from . Enjoy ! 
IS FEELING REFLECTIVE , I GUESS I'M TOO CLOSE TO THE MIRROR TO SEE WHAT YOU SEE IN ME . WHILE YOU SHOWER DOWN YOUR BLESSINGS ON ME . NOT ANYTHING I'VE DONE LORD AS FAR AS I CAN SEE . LORD YOU DONT SEE ME LIKE I'M YOU SEE ME LIKE I'M GONNA TO BE . AS THE SONG STATES . I GUESS I'M TOO CLOSE TO THE MIRROR . HALLELUJAH LORD ! 
This is going to sound like a stupid question , but I hope someone can answer it for me . \ 
Why on a lot of men's facebook < PROPFEMALE > on relationship status they state they are married , but on what they are interested in , they put women and friendship ? Should not your spouse be your friend , and the only woman you are interested in ? Just asking . 
Another thought to ponder , do you think Jesus had money lines after he teached , who came up with this concept and why do so many preachers do it ? and why do we give more value to preachers as opposed to the teachers of the gospel ? 
Is feeling so grateful for the gifts God give those in the church , teachers , prophets , pastors , evangelist and apostles ( Ephesians 4:11 ) . If you encounter each person fully operating in their gift , the end results for you is your Delieverance !!!!!!!!
