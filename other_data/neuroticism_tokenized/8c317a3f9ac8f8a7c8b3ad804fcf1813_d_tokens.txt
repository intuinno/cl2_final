YOUR OUR HEROS !!! We can never repay our DEBT to You !! GOD BLESS < PROPFEMALE > !! I have ALOT of You as My Friends and I thank God for You ALL ! 
Angels & Friends are reminders of Divinity's devotion to our emotional , physical , and psychological well-being . Angels bestow grace & perform miracles ; so do our friends . Angels are Divine Messengers ; so are Friends . God speaks to us through all those intimate chats , conversations , and confessions . Probably because , if we'll listen to anyone , its a pal who Loves us unconditionally and is committed to our happiness . 
Whatever you give a woman , she will make it greater . Give her sperm ; she will give you a baby . Give her a house ; she will give you a home . Give her groceries ; she will give you a meal . Give her a smile ; she will give you her heart . She multiplies & enlarges what she is given . So if you give her crap , be ready to receive a ton of sh*t ! Post on your wall if you agree 
Is Thankful 
The Human Spirit is STRONGER than ANYTHING that can happen to it .

I THINK MYSELF HAPPY ~ Acts 26:2 
Mr. President , I hear you would like to freeze pay rates for military starting next year . Would you also consider cutting your own pay to save money for our country ? While you're at it , lets cut down congressman's pay too . If the people who risk their lives don't get an increase in pay , why would we continue raising pay for those who take no risks and reap the benefits ? jacked f ; < PROPFIRST > Long :D 
Grace be with You , Mercy & Peace ~ 2 John3 <3 <3 <3 <3 
I am Thankful for My Friends & Family ! God Bless everyone of you !!

What cancer cannot do :\ 
It can't Invade the soul , \ 
Suppress memories , \ 
Kill friendship , \ 
Destroy peace , \ 
... Conquer the spirit , \ 
Shatter hope , \ 
Cripple love , \ 
Corrode faith , \ 
Steal eternal life , \ 
Or silence courage . 
love me or hate me , both are in my favor . if you hate me , im always on your mind . if you love me , im always in your heart . 
To all the unselfish Mom's out there who traded eye liner for dark circles , salon haircuts for pony tails , long showers for quick showers , late nights for early mornings , designer bags for diaper bags , and wouldn't change a thing . Let's see how many Mom's post this . Mom's who ... don't care about whatever they gave up and ... instead LOVE what they got in return . Post this if you LOVE your life as a Mom ?

I loved you the minute I heard your heartbeat . I loved you the minute you were born ; then I saw your face and fell in love some more . You were only a minute old , but I knew I would die for you and to this day I still would . When you choose to have a child , you make a conscious decision to allow your heart to walk around outside of your body . Put this on your status if you have children you love more than life ? 
My Life Will Stay Awesome !!! I Have Joy & Peace ! Family & Real GOOD Friends ! I will remain in God & Love & Thankful !!!.... Regardless !!!!! <3

Dragons are nearly unstoppable and , in case you didn't know , they can breathe fire . 93% of people won't copy and paste this because they have already been eaten by dragons . 6% of people are sitting in the shower ... armed with fire extinguishers .

Im Very Happy to find a Beautiful Friend from the past . God is Good . <3 
Copy this and paste it in your status if you know someone , or have heard of someone who knows someone . If you don't know anyone , or even if you've heard of someone who doesn't know anyone , then do still copy this . It's important to spread the message . Oh and the hearts ? ? ? ... for crap's sake don't forget the hearts ! ? ? ?

A man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble ~ JOB 14 ; 1 
In life you either make yourself happy or you follow everyone else and be miserable ! Be yourself and don't worry what others think . Its your life , not theirs ! 
Pisces ; At certain moments you can feel where your < PROPFEMALE > lies . Today will be such a moment for you , Pisces . You may want to shift your fundamental orientation . Every area of your life will be affected by this shift - where you live , who you live with , your children , and your job . Interesting times lie ahead , Pisces . There is no doubt about that .

Out of suffering have emerged the strongest souls . The most massive characters are seared with scars ~ Kahlil Gibran 
There's such a thing a love at first sight because I fell in love with my children the first time I saw them 
I may not be the most Beautiful , or the sexiest , nor do I have the perfect body . I might not be someone's first choice , but I am a great choice . I don't pretend to be someone I'm not because I'm good at being me . I might not be proud of some of the things I've done in the past ..... but I'm proud of who I am today . Take me as I am ... or watch me as I walk away .......... reposted but a good quote . 
FREEDOM !!!!!!! 
Keep me as the apple of thine eye , hide me under the shadow of thy wings ~ psalm 17 ; 8 
I only see Love & the Need to be Loved & Value in Everyone . I have no walls to put up . I can't give up on anyone including myself . At times I hurt & push people away & break down . I get let down . My heart is UNBREAKABLE . When I am wronged It builds my compassion & Love . I have JOY & AMAZING People in my Life that do Everything to bring only Happiness in others Lives ~ me 
Oh sunshine \ 
though love and beauty pass me by \ 
Should I waste my time ? \ 
In your valley , beneath your skies , \ 
( Oh ) I am home . \ 
You move your own mountain \ 
The trees have grown , trees have grown \ 
Now it's over \ 
Now it's over and I'm coming home \ 
( Oh ) I am home 
DON\T GROW UP !! ITS A TRAP !!! " 
Hope is not pretending that troubles do not exist . It is the trust that troubles will not last forever , that hurts will be healed and difficulties overcome .

Behold I go forward , but he is not there : and backward , but I cannot perceive him : On the left hand where he doth work , but I cannot behold him : He hideth himself on the right hand , that I cannot see him : But he knoweth the way that I take : when he hath tried me , I shall come forth as gold . ~ JOB 23:8 -10 ( KJV ) 
Changed my mind about moving to Anchorage ... I only have 5 Chemotherapy treatments left . 
Keep this going !! Heavenly Father , walk through my home and take away all my worries and any illnesses and please watch over and heal my family in Jesus name , Amen . This prayer is so powerful .

Alcoholism is NOT , I REPEAT , NOT a disease , it is a BEHAVIOR . CANCER is a disease , MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS is a disease , and on and on . People do not meet at bars , sporting events or parties to have a few cancers , or muscle spasms , or whatever . You can lead a true alcoholic out of the bar , but they will still drink . ( Shouldn't there be a horse somewhere ?! Gotta get my tongue outta my cheek . Bottoms down !

Live without fear , confront all obstacles , and know that you can overcome them .

You can't make a fool out of a man without his cooperation . 
F.R.I.E.N.D.S. : ( F)ight for you . ( R)espect you . ( I)nvolve you . ( E)ncourage you . ( N)eed you . ( D)eserve you and ( S)tand by you . 
Those who hurt you make you strong , those who criticize you make you important , those who envy you makes you valuable , and those who don't appreciate you bless you with free time , sometimes it's fun to know that those who wish you the worst ... help you prioritize your freetime and empower you . Appreciate your friends because one day you will need them and it would be a shame to find the good ones have moved on

\The experienced mountain climber is not intimidated by a mountain -- he is inspired by it . The persistent winner is not discouraged by a problem -- he is challenged by it . Mountains are created to be conquered ; adversities are designed to be defeated ; problems are sent to be solved .

Good character is more to be praised than outstanding talent ... Most talents are , to some extent , a gift from God ... Good character , by contrast , is not given to us ... We have to build it , piece by piece , by thought , choice , courage , and determination ... much like respect , you don't demand it , you command it by your words , actions and deeds .. Amen ??? † ??? †

Get in the habit of thinking big and desiring wonderful things for yourself and for your fellow man . 
I do not know everything , or pretend to have answers for everything . I do practice thinking . I think for myself . I think about my thoughts . I think about the thoughts of others and see the differences and similarities . I think about why there are differences . I change my mind when it is warranted , I hold my own mind when it is not . I am not ashamed of my thoughts or afraid to give a reasoning for them . I try always ~
