all i have to say to that is whatever . 

says beach , beach , beach , beach . 
insomnia is stupid . i should come with an on and off switch ... come to think of it i am sure many people would agree . but if they know what is good for them they won't * erhrmmm * because i am in training to become a ninja . 
i cannot help it if you are boring . you should just be more interesting . 
today i really miss her . and him . and my city that never sleeps . 
If neurotic is wanting two mutually exclusive things at one and the same time , then I'm neurotic as hell . I'll be flying back and forth between one mutually exclusive thing and another for the rest of my days 
28 days . can we say sweet business . yes , sweet business . 
i guess we just kindapped each others ' minds . but i can't complain . 
misses her oreo . :( boo . 
oh no ! llama face ! 
what is on my mind ? driving , driving , driving , driving . hurry up two weeks , get here ! 
falalalalalalalalalalallalalalaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa . yea , that was me singing a happy tune . which really translates into : 11 more days ! 
almost time for blast off . let the party begin ! 
lalallalallalalalallaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa 
i think i dropped my fruit punch 
The night brings violets , tapestries of eyes ... The claw of the < PROPFEMALE > , drunk on its own scents , asks nothing of life . 
if you are going to be this boring you might as well just be dead . 
how you gonna know who you are , what you feel , till you feel a few things that just don’t feel real 
we're glad for what we've got , done with what we've lost our whole lives laid out right in front of us , sing like you think no one's listening sing me something soft , sad and delicate , or loud and out of key , sing me anything ... 
do people who use twitter actually think people care to know what they are doing 24 hours a day ? and are there really people who are so boring they follow people's twitters ? our society is so self absorbed . 
cannot wait until you get here wodi ! 
Hold onto the world we all remember dying for , there's still hope left in it yet . Sing . Arise . And be all that you dreamed . There's still strength left in us yet . 
tech : you are lame . bring < PROPFIRST > off suspension . that player is a weenie . 
it's a sad , sad day in raiderland 
i am < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE>'s hero . 
\i am not a nice gay man . \"- wisely . " 
I could follow you to the beginning just to relive the start , maybe then we'd remember to slow down at all of our favorite parts ... 
and i don't think war is < PROPMALE > and i don't like to think that love is like war but i got a big hot < PROPFEMALE > bomb , and i want to slip it through the mail slot of your front door 
If I could with trembling fingertips like one who has awoken suddenly blind ; like a woman quickening to life knowing she never really saw anything ' til she cast off sight and parted willful lips to drink the vision in the way she did as a child when she was willing-when she could-would i ? stand knee deep , suck cool marrow from river stones , search out the light 
We horde our bits of glass , our stolen happiness , and polish them with the heat of the sun etching our dreams in the disappearing rainbows . 
I want that first waking momen t-t hat moment when you are in between , before it all comes in-when it is just you and the world tangled up in your good mornings . That is where I want to meet you . How I want to know you . Undressed . Unfinished . 
If I could I would place my pictures of the sun burning the sky with its goodnight upon the wall . And I would gaze upon the wonder and color my eyes violent shades of red and indigo . I would reach and touch the < PROPFEMALE > that should singe my fingertips and melt the flesh from my bones . I would hold it close until I began to glow with its beauty , with its warmth , with my home . 
will be pro obama , even when it isn't cool . and just fyi to all : the economic crisis and downturn started way before obama was elected ... and who gave the inital bailout .. oh wait , yea , that was bush . 
i want to sing one for all the dreamers ; one for the sparks . here's one for the friction makers . we are the bleeding he < PROPMALE > s . i want to turn up the radiation . i want to glow in the dark . Love is the one true innovation . Love is the only < PROPMALE > . 
hello hurricane , you can't silence my love 
trying to friend people you do not know on here baffles me . unless of course it is someone's mom ... . like < PROPMALE>'s mom . 
fml . someone hug me . or give me some drugs so i can take a nap . 
l-o-v-e , LOVES that pretty little purple lg lotus . thanks mommy and daddy :) 
happy beheaded saints day ! 
No sympathy for the devil ; keep that in mind . Buy the ticket , take the ride ... and if it occasionally gets a little heavier than what you had in mind , well ... maybe chalk it off to forced conscious expansion : Tune in , freak out , get beaten 
dear facebook , quit unexpected erroring me . thanks . 
she will wait patiently on her side of the line drenched in the < PROPFEMALE > light of wild abandon ; mad with love and nurtured vulnerability-stripped of her coverings to stand naked and strong before you . A portrait of absolute trust that love will , for once , not leave her empty if she remains uncompromised . 
people should stop being offended when i tune out their boring conversations . really , they should just get more interesting things to talk about . 
so that was not me in that wreck in lubbock . a my middle name is not < PROPFIRST > and b , my name is < PROPFEMALE > with an ie . but thanks for caring if i wrecked myself everyone . :) 
i need nachos ! sigh oh jantizios ... how i misseth thee 
* face palm * stupid people * face palm * 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . * sigh * 
central market = newest love of my life 
I don't even know what you look like . like you should be painted on the side of a bomber or something . And it would be called \Little Whiskey Girl \"- heath ferguson " 
leaves of grass , < PROPFIRST > norton . superb (( say it again < PROPMALE > . superb )) that was for you < PROPFEMALE > . 
I’ve seen into hearts , making me a part of of wondrous things . Making you a part of this way and making you a part of this way where I went 
“I may not have gone where I intended to go , but I think I have ended up where I needed to be . ” - < PROPMALE > adams 
i'm having a nephew !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! yay . i cannot wait for baby kraft . :) 
okay , pen , we have work to do . 
\but i was careful\ " abi ainsworth " 
the bobcat won't move . 
< PROPMALE > will be its first meal 
really , really wants a pizza puff and a hot dog . 
every single cell in our body is replaced every seven years . and by my calculations that means by october 2015 the person i will be will have never even touched you . 
bummer = stupid phot lab techinicians exposing my film so like half of the roll did not turn out . 
listen to our lives , the wind will whisper the way it is . i am going to happen , what a lovely day it is . 
Born of a sign that carries water but in a month that brings just ice . I'm not a skillfull water carrier but I've learned to < PROPFEMALE > love . 
what else is life but a series of chances to touch and be touched ; to feel it all , to give it all , to invite it all in ? The opportunity to take this fragile , transient moment everyone is given and transform it into < PROPMALE > that few may ever see , but that will leave fingerprint impressions on all who behold it . To send them forth with one message , Make it matter . Let the world be better because you are a p < PROPMALE > of it . 
wonders . 
uh , did you say something , i wasn't listening . 
must has baby platypus . right now . 
dear sleep , please embrace me . love , < PROPFEMALE > 
\i can't wait to come visit you down there so i can finally save a horse and ride a cowboy . \ " < PROPFEMALE > -of course < PROPFEMALE > said that . " 
nothing works on you , you are like a rabid dog . 
yay !!! i have a bitch and his name is < PROPMALE > . 
Perhaps when we find ourselves wanting everything , it\ 
is because we are dangerously close to wanting nothing . - < PROPFEMALE > plath 
i'm sorry but there is no such thing as a sober hippie . trust me . 
so i finally know what the true meaning and purpose of life is . gold . we were engineered by aliens to mine gold for their super motherboards . * source : < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > * 
what things are called is unspeakabley more important than what they are . The reputation , name , and appearance , the worth , the usual measure and weight of a thing-originally almost always something mistaken and arbitrary- ... in the end nearly always becomes essence and effectively acts as its essence . -nietzsche 
A new strength , \ 
born of suffering , is pulsating in the veins and a new sympathy and \ 
understanding is being born of past suffering-a greater < PROPFEMALE > to see \ 
others suffer less , and , if they must suffer , to see that they bear it \ 
nobly and come out of it without too many scars . I have wept , but I do \ 
not want others to weep ; but if they do , I know what it means 
two more days and i getta see my < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! hip hip hooray !!!!!!! 
Ummm ... is it too early to start the < PROPMALE > Kraft countdown ? 
Red river , red river let the wrights come over !!! :)

New job = bliss . 
Baby < PROPMALE > is ruheallly on his way !! Hip hip hooray . Amarillo bound in- well , just as soon as preschool is over . :) 
In this space between the turning of the hour , between one day and the next , i gather tremulous hopes to me in barbed sprays like wild fragrant flowers . 
Oh yea , i've totally got the rabies now . 
oh , really , that's awesome . \ 
\ 
sarcasm ? no-never-really never ever . \ 
but really . i don't care . 
you left a pair of scissors in my wife ? \ 
don't worry i did it as a goof . you just have to understand my sense of humor . 
the tape in the cassette deck was choking and it spat out a broken hallelujah 
i wanna turn up the radiation . i wanna glow in the dark . 
\you are not interesting . \ " \ 
the way back home always is the same 
In matters of truth and justice , there is no difference between \ 
large and small problems , for issues concerning the treatment of people are all \ 
the same-albert einstein
