As a parent , I think about my child day and night . I love them in a way that they will never understand . I will be there for them when no one else will . I would take a bullet , jump in front of a train , or ask God to take me instead of them . If you have a child/children that you love as much as I love mine , post this on your < PROPFEMALE > . 
You should put that thing on a leash . 
2nd night down of making Teegan go to sleep in her own bed .. was easier than last night , can only hope it stays that way :/ I do hate to hear her cryyyy :( 
Teegan's saying mama . My life is complete <3
