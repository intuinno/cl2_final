Happy New Year's! & Yes , I know I'm almost an hour late , thank you . 

Re-washing heaps of clothes to donate to my local < PROPFEMALE > . I'm honestly enjoying this trip to minimalism . 
My closet is almost clear of my stuff . Please , tell me , what possesses people to keep their stuffies from childhood ? Why ?! 
Sorting all of the clothes and then everything is FINALLY ready to go . Phew ! 
I didn't just look at a Heinz label and think that the Z was backwards ... 
Hanging out in the bathroom with my face covered in yogurt . It's supposed to be a good moisturiser , but so far I just feel gooey . 
It's 3am and I can't sleep . Perfect time to work on my Korean . 
I just cut myself on a couch . How does that work exactly ? 
I love ordering things that I have on idea what they are . Wor < PROPFEMALE > Gai ? Not a clue . 
Officially finished going through my wardrobe . Life is so easy now ! :) 
First snow of the year . The snowflakes are HUGE ! 
I woke up and everything was covered in a fresh layer of snow . I usually really enjoy winter . However , right now I just want it to be spring . 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas , everyone ! 
On cup three of watered down tea . I hadn't really had caffeine ( other than chocolate ) since August and I am feeling it . Woo ! 
I am sick and tired of repairmen . Why can't anyone fix something the first time ? 
I think the repairmen just set our house on fire . Thanks , Repairmen . 
Look ! It's baby < PROPFEMALE > ! lol 
I do not want to be a Taurus . I liked being a Gemini . :( 
Going to get my body wave ( perm ) . I'm so excited ! Pray that I don't end up lookin ' like a poodle . Seriously . Pray hard , people . 
I thought it would be fun to have something different . My straight hair seemed so plain . I wanted curls . Now , I have nappy-looking < PROPFIRST > Love hair . I want my hair back . :( 
I hear a peacock . He sounds lonely ...
