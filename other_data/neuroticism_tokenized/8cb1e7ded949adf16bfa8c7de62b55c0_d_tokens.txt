Another day , another dollar ... not earned but paid . So I'm pretty much paying to torture myself with knowledge . Lol . 
I hate test days ! I'm always so anxious until I actually take it and then I'm relieved , but waiting around and studying and worrying suck ! And on a day like today it's not hard to drift off into daydreams . Lol 
taking this opportunity of free time to get back to tumblr and start working on what could eventually be my own business :) 
my skin and hair are thanking me for the decrease of stage make up and hairspray :) lol
