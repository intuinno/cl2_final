NO !!! Goodbye 2010 . You shall be missed . ;( 

Greetings , 2011 . Don't try anything too drastic , please . 
I'm still trying to figure out how to work this thing . :( \ 
\ 
But I'm sure I'll be facebooking with the best of them soon enough . :D 
Thinks he's getting a better idea of how to work this crazy thing . 
Just finished a LONG two-hour drive . I hate driving . :( \ 
When are they finally gonna invent the teleporter ? 
Is happy that < PROPFIRST > is leaving for his 7-week long camp in a minute . :D 
Is sad that his favorite video game was broken all day today . :( \ 
He actually had to read ! * gasp * . O_O 
Is eager to get to his week-long Worldview Academy , which begins on Sunday . :D 
I just got back from Worldview Academy . It was AWESOME !!! :D \ 
One of the greatest weeks ever ! Certainly the greatest in 2010 so far ! \ 
And now , I'm not back at home for two hours , and my family and I are already heading out the door to celebrate Fourth of July weekend at the Grandparents . \ 
Wowza . 
Anyone know if there's any way to disable the spam from friends ' games ? If I hear one more thing about stupid Farmville ... 
Just bought and played his first M-rated video game besides the Halo series . It's called \Mass Effect\ " . It's pretty awesome ( and rather old . Graphics need an update . ) and doesn't deserve it's M-rating . Could have been T if the developers had been a bit smarter about certain dialogue choices I think ... \ 
Yep ! ;) \ 
I take it you haven't yet learned how to comment on the photo directly ? See If you can figure that out . :) \ 
Hey , get the Facebook app for your IPod touch . It's simpler , and portable . 
Just narrated two epic games of mafia , won a crazy Foosball ( sp ? ) battle , barely beat a worthy opponent in a chess match , and played two huge games of apples-to-apples , winning one , losing the other . Oh and there were a couple awesome games of ninja too . All in all , a good night's work . :) 
Is already about 2/3 of the way through Mass Effect , not counting bonus missions . It's awesome ; The storyline and the characters are incredible ! My favorite quote so far :\ 
“Some people think asking for help is a sign of weakness . That’s just stupid and stubborn . No matter how strong you are , allies can make you stronger . ”\ 
- Commander Shepard , the player character 
Starcraft II : Wings of < PROPFEMALE > was released today !!! :D \ 
About time ! Gamers have waited over a decade for this ! \ 
Remember this day . For gamers , this game's release is a more important event than Obama's election . \ 
Okay , maybe I'm exaggerating . :) \ 
But it's big . Very big . 
Spent practically the ENTIRE day today writing a short story . I get my writing assignments each thursday , and am supposed to have a week to finish them . But this time , I only have today and tomorrow morning ( because I'm leaving for < PROPFEMALE > . :D ) , and it's the final assignment . So it's the hardest . After typing the whole day , I'm only about 3/4 done . :'( \ 
Gonna be working hard tomorrow morning , I guess . :/ 
Phew . The story is finished . :D \ 
Now to finish packing and other last minute preparations . \ 
In a couple of hours , I'm off to southern California to visit family , and then from there to < PROPFEMALE > for Campus by the Sea . Can't wait ! :D 
Just got back from Catalina . \ 
It . Was . AWESOME !!! \ 
I wish it never had to end . :( 
Is in Wisconsin , picking up \The Other Brother\ " from his summer camp . " 
Back ! Wisconsin's great and all , but there's nothing like home sweet home . :) \ 
Now to get caught up on everything . :/ 
Leaving for the annual Colacchia camping weekend in a couple hours . Should be fun . :) 
Back . :) \ 
It was great fun . 
I can finally feel the tooth that they have been trying to pull through my gum for months . \ 
Won't be too much longer now before these braces come off ! Can't wait ! :D 
Just came back from the first part of an apologetics seminar . It was completely awesome . I can't wait for the second part tomorrow morning ! :D 
Has a lot of status updates he's about to give out 
Finished the apologetics seminar . I loved it . It was great , from \Case for the Existence of the Soul\ " ( Though I disagreed with some of the side-points he made ) to \ " Inside the Mind of a Former Athiest\ " . Awesome . " 
Is going to leave tomorrow morning for a week-long Alaskan cruise . :D 
Cannot find his new shirts purchased specifically for the Alaskan cruise . :( 
' s birthday is tomorrow 
' s youngest brother < PROPFIRST > is now a 1st degree Black Belt . I now have two younger brothers that could potentially beat me in a fight . :( \ 
Ah well , congratulations to him . 
Just came back from an awesomely awesome party in honor of < PROPFIRST>'s black belt . It was awesome . 
Wants to buy new apropriate adjectives other than my overly used \awesome\ " . Suggestions ? " 
Was just informed that , after a thorough search , the shirts in question had been mistakenly packed by < PROPFIRST > . Go figure . :/ 
Is , for mostly unknown reasons mostly unrelated to previous posts , in a good mood . And is hoping that it will remain so through the packing process 
And finally ... is wondering what the record is for the largest number of meaningful facebook posts in shortest amount of time . 
Is going to be absent for the next week because of the cruise . ( unless I somehow find free WiFi somewhere . ) . So fare well my friends ! 
Has completed his 16th year of life on this Earth . 
Is in the Seattle airport , waiting for the plane to take me home . I've got a lot to catch up on here it seems . Too bad I haven't had WiFi before now . 
The trip was amazing . The cruise ship was awesome , except for the birdcage-sized rooms ( okay , very slight exaggeration ) , the fancy dinners ( do we really need that many different kinds of silverware ? ) , and the crowds . ( if you get claustrophobic , don't go on a cruise . You'd think a ship that size would have more room ... ) 
But unlimited free soft-serve ice cream , incredibly talented entertainers , and awesome time with extended family made it a spectacular cruise . \ 
( btw , Alaska ? Really , Really cold . Wet too . Still , I can now say I've been to Juneau [ that state capital is probably the smallest little village I've ever been to ] , and seen several beautiful glaciers . )\ 
And now , school . Whoopee . 
Is not enjoying the status update character limit . :( \ 
Especially the part where , at least on the IPod app , it doesn't tell you the number of characters you need to get rid of . 
But , though it is just to condemn some Christians for these things , perhaps , after all , it is not just , though very easy , to condemn Christianity itself for them . Indeed , there are impressive indications that the positive quality of joy is in Christianity -- and possibly nowhere else . If that were certain , it would be proof of a very high order . \ \

\Life is more difficult when you're stupid\ " \ 
\God doesn't deliver you from a crisis . \ 
There are few things more satisfying than singlehandedly taking on three very skilled allied enemies in multiplayer Starcraft , and pwning them ! That's right , 3 against 1 , and I still won ! :D \ 
Thanks for the awesome game , enemy team of < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > , and < PROPFIRST > Colacchia ! Better luck next time ! >:) 
Poll time !!! \

\To our wounds 
Just came back from an EPIC costume party . I went as Chraz the Elven Shadow Warrior . I had a cloak , sword , even elf ears . :) 
I'd nearly forgotten how good it feels to waste a Saturday doing almost nothing productive . :) \ 
On that note ... I've gotten nearly every achievement possible in the campaign of Starcraft 2 ! :D \ 
( and let me tell you , it's not easy ) 
\No one is beyond redemption . \ " \

Seeking to understand why , a research team used brain imaging to watch people's neural responses to the questions . Only when given the 2nd dilemma did the area of the brain involved with emotion light up . Despite the identical logic , the 2nd problem engaged emotions that altered moral judgement . Moral judgement is not just thinking ; it is also a gut-level feeling . \\ 
Is about ready to < PROPFEMALE > Facebook because of its stupid character limit . >:( 
Why didn't the Empire just use the Death < PROPFEMALE > to blow up the gas giant Yavin ? That would have destroyed the rebel base on its < PROPFEMALE > Yavin 4 , and they wouldn't have had to wait until they were in range of the < PROPFEMALE > , thereby allowing the rebels time to destroy them . 
\90% of all wardens agree : letting prisoners escape is bad for your career . \ " \ 
The best quote from The < PROPMALE > Show , where < PROPMALE > lists the questions that each one of us must ask and answer :\ 
< PROPMALE > : Who are you ? \ 
Christof : [ speaking out of the fake sky ] I am The Creator - of a television show that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions . \ 
< PROPMALE > : Then who am I ? \ 
Christof : You're the star . \ 
< PROPMALE > : Was nothing real ? \ 
Christof : You were real . That's what made you so good to watch . 
Well , it is midnight . On Halloween . Anyone scared ? I hope not . I do wonder though : what are your views on Halloween ? Is it evil ? If so , why ? Can it be redeemed ? Is it just another holiday , neither good nor evil ? How does it differ from other pagan holidays like Christmas and Easter ? \ 
What do you think about Halloween ?

Finally managed to see Inception ! Wow . Great movie . Contains some very interesting ideas . ( and plenty of explosions for those who prefer the action-packed side of it ) . \ 
My favorite quote , because it portrays the whole reality-questioning theme of the movie :\ 
Eames : They come here every day to sleep ? \ 
Old Man : No . They come to be woken up . The dream has become their reality . Who are you to say otherwise ? 
I love being a chronokinetic for a day . :D 
\Loyalty to country ALWAYS . Loyalty to government 
\Fairy tales are more than true ; not because they tell us that dragons exist 
Anyone have any recommendations for excellent little-known Christian music ? I'm getting kinda bored of the stuff I hear constantly on K-love and Air 1 , even though it's awesome . 
Is off to watch the midnight showing of < PROPMALE > Potter and the Deathly Hallows : Part 1 ! I can't wait to see what this newest movie does to ruin the books ' awesome story . :D \ 
( no , really . ) 
Just arrived home again , at 3:00 in the morning . :D \ 
Wow . < PROPMALE > Potter was amazing . They even remained true to the books . Best story , best scenery , best special effects , best movie yet , hands down . Can't WAIT for part 2 ! 
\People do not like to think . If one thinks

Today , a little girl walked up to me and said , \I like your teenager teeth . \ " XD " 
I'm pleased that the imminent destruction of all organic life has improved your career opportunities .

Have a Happy Thanksgiving ... or else . 
saw Megamind , that new Dreamworks movie based on the premise of a supervillain who actually manages to defeat the superhero and finds out evil isn't all it's cracked up to be . I thought it had a better plot and better themes than Tangled , but Tangled was funnier and just generally more well-made . :) 
I don't suffer from insanity . I enjoy it . 
Censorship . Where do you stand ? Freedom ? Restriction ? What circumstances , if any , justify the censorship of books , movies , or any other media ? Where do you draw the line ? 
I wonder what would have happened if God had told < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > that they could eat anything they wanted ... except snakes . 
Pilot : \Please keep your personal belongings with you at all times . \ " \ 
Just got back from Biola Bound . SO tired . But it was totally awesome . Got rained on at Disneyland ( No lines ! Wahoo ! ) , experienced the highs and lows of sharing dorm rooms and learning in true classrooms , met some truly amazing people , both other Biola bounders and current students . All in all , definitely want to go to Biola next year .

Just watched < PROPFIRST > Hood : < PROPMALE > of Thieves for the first time . It was very interesting on so many levels . I especially loved the contrast between the Muslim Moor and Friar Tuck . Good movie . Definitely not for kids though . :/ 
Saw Voyage of the < PROPFEMALE > Treader . Wow . Hollywood's crazy . I can understand some of the changes , like the new theme of overcoming temptation . But others just make me shake my head , like the addition of a sailor and his daughter who join the crew on the Lone Islands , or the new climatic battle on the Dream Island . :( \ 
The dragon was awesome though . :) \ 
Good movie . I just wish they'd learn to stick to the book more . 
Tomorrow morning I take the driving test . Wish me luck ! 
9 errors . I passed . :) 
Odd . I'm sick . Sore throat , runny nose . But I was just sick a couple months ago ! This NEVER happens . :( 
Me : How do you know ? \ 
Scott : I'm a psychopath . \ 
Me : Don't you mean psychic ? \ 
Scott : No , psychopath . 
Just watched Men in Black . Awesome Sci-Fi movie . :D 
Fabio won Survivor ! SO happy ! He was the only one that deserved it . ( and he's a crazy surfer dude , so that's saying a lot about his competition . ) If anyone else had won I would have screamed and thrown the tv away . Well , actually , that's a huge exaggeration . I probably would have just fumed for a short while then forgot all about it . But the previous statement gets my point across more dramatically . :) 
Wow . Just saw the pilot episodes of the original Battlestar Galactica series . That's one Sci-Fi show that does not age gracefully , let me tell you . XD\ 
But it's still really awesome . :) 
It astounds me how times change . The classic Battlestar Galactica series contains numerous references to \God\ " and \ " Lord\ " 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas ! \ 
Incidentally , Christmas = Christ mas = More [ of ] Christ . I love how every time someone wishes < PROPFEMALE > Christmas , they're actually wishing them to have more of Jesus Christ . :) \ 
And if anyone sees < PROPFEMALE > Claus tonight , capture him immediately . We'll hold him hostage until the elves pay ransom . >:)
