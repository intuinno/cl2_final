done with finals today + leaving for Honduras tomorrow to visit and help out in their community = the BEST SPRING BREAK OF MI < PROPFEMALE > ! See you in a week , California :) 
For once in my life , I took the road less travelled by and learned the most important lesson any human could possibly comprehend : our world is so much bigger than our personal problems and reputations ; all of our lives , we work to substantiate ourselves for personal gain , but fail to truly see outside of that . It took me one week after 19 years in this world to understand this . How long will it take you ?
