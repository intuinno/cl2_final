Of course , if you care about me ( and you'd better ) , you'll ask what's wrong . Just don't expect me to tell you anything . 
Dear Mary , \ 
Just admit that you slept with someone else . This is getting out of hand . \ 
Sincerely , < PROPFIRST > 
If I ever become an evil overlord , all bumbling conjurers , clumsy squires , no-talent bards , and cowardly thieves in the land will be pre-emptively put to death . My foes will surely give up and abandon their quest if they have no source of comic relief . 
I'm getting sick enough of this that it may soon override my stubbornness .
