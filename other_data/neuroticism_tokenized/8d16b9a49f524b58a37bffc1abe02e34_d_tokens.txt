So ... What do you want from 2011 ? 

I just thought of the ultinate Heart on a Stick and am thinking about how to improve it . 
Anyone hear about the volcano eruption ? 
Which is better : < PROPMALE > deli or Jewish deli ? < PROPMALE > ones have a lot of sausage , but jewish ones have pastrami . 
a lot of teachers dont seem to know sometimes that you actually have other classes with actual homework 
if u don't want people to post on ur wall , then don't go on facebook 
Richmond 
i luv weekends 
i atually get to sleep in without my #$^&*(@#%$@#&%$(@%$(*#@#^&ing alarm clock blaring at me 
i just went to MOCA yesterday ...... very interesting 
there's some wierd < PROPMALE > out there 
my entire itunes library just somehow deleted itself in the night without me doing anything 
Macs might be better than PC's , but Macs still aren't perfect (*^&#* %^#$&#%ing itunes ) 
my parents are making me go to CST prep before school starts and its not that bad 
boy scouts aren't nessacerily all moral and uptight 
i am madly panicking about CSTs 
The algebra test was actually pretty easy 
late start = amazing 
all school days should be late start 
its the weekend !!!! 
All of the Cst's ive taken so far have been easy 
:{ } 
i r deomocrat lols 
Last day of testing ! :( I actually kinda like the testing schedule . I didn't have to go to math for one and a half weeks . 
< PROPFEMALE > !!!! < PROPFEMALE > shall win in 7th period !! ???? 7 ???????? 
******************************************************************\ 
< PROPFEMALE>'s not winning . 
< PROPFEMALE > now claims victory in 7th period ! 
I like fridays 
Except when i know I'm going on a campout tommorrow and dont get to sleep in 
If ur daydreaming at night while awake , does that make it night dreaming , daydreaming , or just dreaming ? 
I just got back from a campout that was either really wierd or really amazing depending on how you view it . Here's why . 
My patrol made cup of noodles and our senior \ 
patrol leader actually said that we were making good food . about a month left until summer officially begins . We got to our \ 
campsite , it was warm and < PROPFEMALE > with barely a cloud in the sky . We wake \ 
up in the morning and find that it's snowing . In southern California . \ 
With summer less than a month away . Then it all melts in 2 and a half hours . 
is going whitewater rafting this weekend . 
just got back from an amazing whitewater rafting trip . Amazing ! I will post pictures when i get them . 
Wierd day 
Just got transferred to germany today for no reason . 
:) thinking about a person 
Had a fun time talking about \Bill and < PROPMALE>'s Excellent Adventure . \ " Duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuude . " 
Wouldn't you get a bit panicky and violent if you were rudely awakened at three in the morning to find that your boat was under several spotlights , military craft surrounded it , helicopters were encircling you , and commandoes were climbing into your boat waving what appeared to be semiautomatic rifles and grenades ? 
ust\ 
figured out how to ruin a politician's rep from a friend 
i found out how NOT to cook sausage 
Just finished watching Beetlejuice . Wierd movie . 
The movie Knowing is vaguely creepy . 
P.E. Locker #409 has served me well over three years of flying shoes , shirts , pants , axe cans , deoderant smears , and unwashed p.e. uniforms . And come out unscathed and mostly clean . :( 
All eighth grades should leace something in their street locker to mess with the next person who gets that locker . 
First person to like this status will be my \ 
middle name for the rest of the week .... Put this as your status and see\ 
who u get (: 
The P.E. Locker = able to survive thrown shoes , flung bodies , and exploding deoderant cans 
will miss waking up and yelling \It's a Friday ! \ " and his wonderfully eccentric and amazing teachers . " 
technically doesn't have a school and has no grade . But if you don't count technicalities , than he's a freshman now . 
laughed as his friend screamed like a two-year old girl that inhaled helium ( and is a guy ) for no reason at all at Disneyland . 
SSSSSSSSSSSUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRR\ 
VVVVVAAAAAAAAACCCCAAAAAAAAAATIIIIIIIOOOOOONNNN !!!!!!! 
???? <?) 
Now that summer's started I have no idea what to do with myself . There are too many options . 
I found a HUGE collection of National Geographic Magazines going back to 1916 buried deep in \ 
an unused closet in my house . 
Bookman is such a great store . At Barnes and < PROPMALE > you can get a decent book for fifteen dollars . At Bookman , you can get five or six ecent books in good condition for fifteen dollars . 
hiked 9 < PROPMALE > up to mount Baden-Powell and had fun doing it . According to the Official Troop 243 Count , we went through 82 switchbacks , up and down . 
USA AND ENGLAND BOTH GO THROUGH IN GROUP C !!!!!!!!!! YES !!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Raindrops keep fallin ' on my head ............................. 
So .... The US of A lost . This just proves that Americans can't play and don't care about soccer . 
AAARRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHH !!!!!!!!!!!! What was that ref thinking ? The ball was \ 
two feet inside the goal and he says it's not in the goal ! And England is discouraged and loses . We should start a petition to have the Germany-England match redone to make it fair . 
is going to summer camp and ended up as the Chaplain for his troop . 
I get to spend seven days ( sunday through saturday ) with half crazed , sugar-addicted boy scouts ( which includes me ) . Prayers for our souls , anyone ? 
had a very unusual summer camp involving wolfmen , skin color changes , a knife fight , < PROPMALE > Hurgendurgendurgen , a dude with way too long hair , a cop going ninja , a bunker made out of sticks and pine needles , really , really , really large amounts of card games and < PROPFEMALE > , and a Coke addict . 
Well , Spain has won in the most violent world cup finals ever with 12 players out of 22 recieving yellow cards and 1 recieving a red card . This getting kinda close to The Battle of Nuremburg with 16 yellow cards and 4 red cards . 
gets to go to the East Coast for two weeks with his mildly insane Jambo troop and , within this . the three man Nerd Squad . 
managed to get lost on his first day of cross country . An auspicous start . Ho-hum . 
Bag check for Jambo ! This is where you find that you're missing something even though you saw yourself put everything on the list into the bag . 
Can bad luck be a communicable disease ? 
ad hoc ab lock e qui pro quo ... tanto da \ 
apprendere ... e tempo non ho 
Just have to slog through today and tomorrow and then I'm off to Jambo . 
People who wake up before 8:00 A.M. on a summer day just because they can are either caffeine addicts or partially insane . 
is trying out Facebook in Gaeilge for no good \ 
reason . 
Back to English . 
has bought a Swiss Army Wallet . 
Is remembering The Burbs . 
These words he speaks are true ..... We're all huminary stew . 
I just found out that if you read 12 books that are at least 300 pages in length each , than that's the equivalent of going to summer school . In which case , I just need to read one more . Sorry for those in summer school ( AVID ) :) 
I have to get up too bloody early tommorrow .... 2:00 A.M. is too early for any normal , sane human being to wake up , except in unusual circumstances . Curse the person who decide that we have to be at Council at 3:00 A.M. At least I get to miss Cross-Country ..... sigh . 
Leaving for Jambo today ! 
Oh . My . God . Jambo was officially amazing . And I now hate east coast \ 
weather . So it's a hot 90 degrees in California with 20% humidity . Give me my blanket . And \ 
humidifier . < PROPFEMALE > was worse . Much worse . If you sweated , the only way to get it off was with a towel because it didn't dry off . 
He's a real nowhere man , sitting in his nowhere land , making all his nowhere plans , for nobody . 
1:00 and time for lunch . 
Who decided that homework would be a good idea during summer ? 
Give me my blanket . It's not hot enough in California . 
Cross-Country\ 
was weird . Coach < PROPFEMALE > was gone , as were his assistants and 3/4's of the\ 
class . < PROPMALE > and I were two of four freshman there . xD 
Made a good $40 off of selling smoothies in 2 and a half hours . That was a lot better than minimum wage , and with less work . 
Three good tips for life : One , do good deeds . Second , always pay your debts . And third , don't die if you can help it . 
\Kopek ....... Is that a Slavic name ? \ " \ " .................. NO ! \"" 
I really , really like rewatching The Burbs 
Porcupine tree concert was fun 
Greatest way to avoid death : don't get born . 
What should go into a Heart Attack on a Stick ? 
I . Hate . Summer . Homework . It's summer . The whole point of summer is getting a break from school . Which includes homework . Yes , I know it's HOMEwork , but it's assigned at school . Sigh . Rants are so much fun . 
I like my < PROPFEMALE > test results . 
How'd I get so ...... white and nerdy ?

Victory is declared over the evil homework honors project . 
Wow . High school is ............... just school . 
People think I'm a sophomore . 
managed to flirt with a 16 year old at his cousins wedding without even realizing it afterwards . 
I'm depressed . 
Americans are insane about wakeup times . 
Well , Troop 812 is officially dissolved now . Sad face . :( 
I feel much , much better now . 
< PROPMALE > Roth is really weird for an English guy . 
Xbox 360 for birthday . Yes or no ? 
rBookman = most AMAZING bookshop ever 
No . I don't know some random person named Amardesjich Khamaringhed . 
Oh my God . I just remembered about Buddha Bomb . 
HOLY SHET !!!!! COPS WERE RUNNING AROUND WITH ASSAULT RIFLES IN THE FOOTHILL PARKING LOT !!!!! 
I really hate being on the freshman team for U16 . Most other teams have a lot of 15 and 16 year olds , which makes things that much harder . 
Yes , it's hot . It's California . Live with it . 
108 degrees at the high point . What have the poor citizens of Tustin done to be hit by this ? 
Does copying 93 definitions out of a textbook count as \busy\ " work ? " 
Hope that no one decides to be an eejit in the bio lab . 
Awwww . Nobody spilled hydrochloric acid . 
This week , I think that the weather had bipolar disorder . 
Eat it . Just eat it . Doesn't matter if it's boiled or fried , just eat it . 
It better pour rain tomorrow . Rainmaker , the cross country team is depending on you . 
YESYESYESYESYES ! 
Yes . It's gone . 
Urgh . I had a neat-off with two of my dad's grad students at a Mexican restaurant and now I'm stuffed . 
Never put a kid in charge of part of the cross country team . 
Beast . Our goalie dribbles the ball across the field and scores . In real life , not in FIFA . Again , beast . Thank you Rikkin . 
I feel intensely satisfied with life . 
October is cancermonth . In memory of every cancer patient , family member and friend who has lost their battle with cancer and in honor of those who continue to conquer it ! Put this up for 1 hour if you love someone who has or had cancer .

Mega Halloween movie marathon with mega < PROPFEMALE > munching !!! 
Mega Movie Marathon = WIN . 
Nom om Nom . 
Blargh .

Palm trees are fun to burn . Lots and lots of lovely sparks and bonfires . 
Skaludy 
Biological Chemistry ? Or Chemical Biology ? 
Chemistry that involves explosives it is then .

One uncle plays the flute , another uncle plays the violin , my aunt plays the violin , my cousin started and is still a member of a popular band in Ireland called < PROPFIRST > Smyth , and my dad plays the accordion and piano . Schwow . 
Beatles music on Itunes ! YESYESYESYESYESYES !!!!!!!!!

Bloody weather ..... Snow is fun except when it's a blizzard and you're trying to find somewhere to get lunch in it . 
Utah = Giants playground . 
Utah has amazing scenery , but has cold and awful weather . But it does have < PROPFIRST > McStiff's and whisky burgers . 
Don't fall off the edge in Canyons . It's a long way down . 
I got to see what may be the oldest piece of graffiti in America = A cave pianting made in the B . C . ' S that was probably made by teenagers . 
Should I buy a jawbone to put on my desk ? 
So it turns out there's an escaped convict from Salt Lake City running around in Moab ..... with a gun ..... and he shot a cop ..... six times ..... and I'm in Moab . 
Obligatory Happy Thanksgiving assorted peoples ! 
A lovely -9 degrees oautside w/ 2 feet of snow ! yes that's right . I meant to put a - sign . 
-9 degrees plus rain = snow . Snow plus lots of people hiking on a trail = ice . Ice plus old boots = Falling . Falling plus < PROPMALE > nearby = :OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO .

Little children should not be running around screaming and pounding on doors for half an hour in hotels . 
Anyone want to help me take over Idaho ? 
Idaho has been taken . 
So\ 
that sheet from Bio ..... I did it while I was in Utah ..... Including the \ 
essay questions ... And then I found out the day back that Beamer had sent\ 
out an e-mail saying we didn't have to do the essay questions .... Grrr . 
Has anybody noticed that the chat thingy in the bottom right corner seems to be unable to count correctly at times ? 
My ipod nano has now officially died . 
Yes ? 
I have now added another teacher to the list of my teachers on Facebook . 
I come in packs of ten .... with five varieties 
Question of the day : Why all the cartoon profile pics ? 
So I found out who started the obesity epidemic in America .... There is a British restaurant in Brooklyn that will fry anything edible . Yes , if you can eat it , they will deep fry it . 
So practically no one that I talked to heard the thunder or saw the flashes ... I'm saddened that they missed it but glad that they're able to be asleep at half past ten . 
I just saw a person with over a thousand friends ..... holy cow .... 
Random Scary Fact : A group of European and American reasearch labs recently conducted a study on Americans knowlege of their own country . They found these scary facts : 79% pecent of the tested could not pass the basic test required to become an American citizen . 43% didn't know what the three branches of the government were . And a shocking 26% didn't know that the U.S.A. wasn't always an independent country . 
Bloody fire alarms ..... I have only ever heard an alarm on a school used for an actual alarm once . 
To all those who are are Ocarina of Time devotees and claim that it ranks uberishly highly among all games rated ..... It's not in the top 10 .... Or the top 50 .... Or the top 150 .... Or the top 200 ... It is down here at 225 . I'm sorry . 
I bloody hate buracracies . So I had to go up to the office becuase they wanted me for some reason .... turned oput they had the wrong name and I spent the whole period getting shunted around to different people ...... I missed the whole period and my coach marked me absent .... The next day I told my coach what happened and she said she'd clear my absence 
Now for the next installment in Bureaucracy Land Adventures ! Today our hero was summoned to the office again . He was told that his godlike parental intervention ( due to the failure of the office to listen to our hero ) was not valid becuase the supposed cut was during 6th period . Our hero inquired as to what sort of people could clear the supposed cut . 
Episode III of Bureacracy Land : So today I got called to the library during World History . I go up to the only person in there and ask why I was called . She said that no one in the library had called for anyone . She told me to go up to the office . I went up there and they repeated the same thing as her and told me to go back to the library . 
Most people have 1000 wishes for Christmas ; a cancer patient only has one , to get better . I know 97% of you won't repost this as your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do . In honor of someone who has died , or is still fighting it , or survived cancer , copy this to your status 
This was an awfully strange marine ... And I knew there was something wierd about him ' cuz when I turned around he was pulling a big palm tree right out of the ground and swatting those Charleys from here to Kingdom Come . 
Let's take a test ..... Who is at least semi-observant and cares to guess who my crush is and publicly annoy me about it ? Hint : It's obvious . 
So ... They're on their way to getting rid of Don't Ask , Don't Tell .... Any thoughts ? 
So .... Who likes the rain ? 
Well ... I guess the rain is good prep for Philmont . 
Ho ho ho ! The great chubby man is watching you all and wishes you a happy christmas ! 
Happy Christmas ! 
I much prefer my Fuze to my perpetually cursed Ipod . 
Ahhhh .... To have a philly cheesesteak from < PROPMALE>'s Steakhouse ...

So ... My Bio teacher is making us \marry\ " someone in our class for our last unit of the year . And I'm pretty sure that the < PROPFIRST > are uneven ... Who's the lucky couple(s) ? " 
< PROPMALE > Coulter should be elected permanent grubmaster . 
Mondays are an invention of the Devil . 
Wow .... I just found a group where by going through several links and looking around a lot you can find vocab answers . Sometimes I think that people spend more time and energy trying to cheat then they would if they simply decided to not cheat and actually think . 
Man City , you are so fun yet so unpredictable . 4-1 with the wolves , yet you let in two goals in twenty minutes and are saved by the hand of god and a fair amount of luck . 
Snowman invasion ! 
Whoever invented finals evidently never actually had to take one . And it just gets worse over the years . From my current bottom of the barrel status as a freshman to my grad student years it goes from 10-20% to 40% of the semester grade . \ 
\ 
Okay , now that I've officially expressed my and all of Foothill Highs panic over finals I can go back to studying .... 
Studying . For . Finals . Is . Really . Annoying . 
Alert ! The time of panic is beginning in 16 hours ! Alert ! 
Two down , three to go . Two more days of intense panic . * Sigh * 
Okay .... The finals are releasing their hold on me ... Only one more to go plus an insanely easy physical test in track .... 
18 mile hike+breaking in new boots = Feet feeling like meat knives are stabbing them repeatedly and then having salt rubbed in . 
Random fact : Most < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > cartoons are made in Czechoslovakia . 
Anyone for a revolt against the coach in charge of the jumpers and sprinters ? 
Yum .

Death Valley campout = AMAZING !!! 
I have gotten a haircut . Please observe a moment of silence for the mop of hair . A funeral will be held on Saturday at noon . 
So ..... We're going to Calico Ghost town again . This means hyperactive teenagers , lots of < PROPFEMALE > , too much free time , wind , rubber band gun wars , and Whoop-Ass hot sauce . In other words , a fun campout . 
I thank the people of < PROPFEMALE > for their food . 
So it turns out that Sir < PROPFIRST > Wren is my great great great great great grand-uncle . That goes toward explaining all the architects and enginers on my moms side of the family . 
PPPPPPPUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUPPPPPPPPPPPYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
< PROPFEMALE > .............. 
Time for Calico ! Cheap < PROPFEMALE > , cheap soda , knicknacks , Whoop-Ass hot sauce , rubber band gun wars , custom built shelters , one match fires , and the site of Troop 243's first snipe hunt . 
Puppies = amazingly cute . 
Puppies = amazing .
