Besides being Valentines day , tomorrow is a very precious day for me . 26 years ago on Feb . 14th , my daughter < PROPFEMALE > came into the world andmy life has never been the same . Happy Birthday < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > ! 
... and the countdown begins . Texas and warmth . nice ! 
I love my life and where I'm at . Took a long time to get here ! 
70+ Here we come !! 
Took a nap with the sun beating down on us . 74 and < PROPFEMALE > . Gotta love it ! 
Guess we lost the balmy warm and < PROPFEMALE > Texas weather along our way home .... Ooops . 
my heart pines for the warmth of more civilized climates ........ sigh ~ 
Trust is never an issue in friendship until its been violated ~ me 
Sitting here quietly , waiting and watching . There is nothing kept secret that will not come to light . 
What you are comes to you ~ < PROPMALE > 
We worry about what a child will become tomorrow , yet we forget that he is someone today . ~ Stacia Tauscher

March ~ for me the month Cabin Fever reaches its peak . Surely it cant be much longer ??? 
I'm not hard to get along with , I have issues with blindly trusting andbeing manipulated . ;) 
I understand that men go thru midlife crisis , but this is ridiculous ! < PROPMALE > and I were at the grocery store when he begins to look intently at me .....

If you need a book to tell you not to lie , cheat , steal or kill I have only pity for you ~ 
Sometimes ... no matter how you try ... you just ain't gonna be fancy enough for some folks . I rather like who I am and fancy ain't what it takes to be me .
