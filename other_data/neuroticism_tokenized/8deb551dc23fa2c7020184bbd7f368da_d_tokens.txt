Don't flatter yourself that friendship authorizes you to say disagreeable things to your intimates . The nearer you come into relation with a person , the more necessary do tact and courtesy become . Except in cases of necessity , which are rare , leave your friend to learn unpleasant things from his enemies ; they are ready enough to tell them . ~ Oliver < PROPMALE > Holmes 
is really excited about New < PROPFEMALE > comming out soon . 
turning out to be quite the social weekend , things are looking up XD

Hello Mother Nature ? I love Autumn , bring on the comfy hoodies , cozy fireplaces , Halloween and thanksgiving . but this year ... do you think that we could possibly skip winter and go strait to spring ?
