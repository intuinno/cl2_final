Pleasure of love lasts but a moment , Pain of love lasts a lifetime . 
Am at home , and all alone .... BORED ! 
Sometimes your nearness takes my breath away ; and all the things I want to say can find no voice . Then , in silence , I can only hope my eyes will speak my heart . 
You have to walk carefully in the beginning of love ; the running across fields into your lover's arms can only come later when you're sure they won't laugh if you trip . 
If I had a single flower for every time I think about you , I could walk forever in my garden . 
Goin to make a coconut pound cake .... will be back on later . 
Within you I lose myself . Without you I find myself wanting to become lost again . 
I'm back on the internet again ....

With time , women gain weight because we accumulate so much information & wisdom in our heads that when there is no more room , it distributes out to the rest our bodies . So we aren't heavy , we are enormously cultured , educated & happy . Beginning today , when I look at my belly in the mirror I will think , Good Grief ~ look ... how smart I am .. ~ Ladies If you agree with me ... Repost it . I love it ! 
People need to understand that children with special needs don't have an illness , so there is no cure & it's not contagious . They only want what we all want , to be accepted . Most of you probably won't copy and paste this . Will you do it and leave it on your status for at least an hour ? It's Special Education week , and this is in honor of all the kids who need a little extra help & understanding . 
Eating some Peanut M&M's and playing my games ...

HAPPY Cinco De Mayo !!!!! Wish I had a < PROPFEMALE > .....

I am realizing that I am more like my Nanny as I get older ... I drnk coffee to wake up , and I drink coffee to sleep ... 
I went Deep Sea fishing on Sayurday , and well I did not catch the biggest fish but I did catch the biggest thing ... A Sea Turtle ( will post pics later ) and a real real bad sun burn . I spent 3 days in bed to recop , and I can now walk , and legs are not tender anymore . Arms and face still tender . \ 
Wanting to tell all the Mothers out there Happy Late Mother's Day . 
Promise to post pics of Sea Turtle tomorrow . Am tired ... heading to bed . And , Happy Late Mother's Day again to all the mom's out there . 
Why is it hat CHILDREN never seem to understand things ? Is it wrong that you want the best for your kids , and that you try to show them love and that things are not always as people say they were . And , that you never gave up , never quit caring . 
That there is not a day that goes by that you wish things were different ? Is it wrong to want to not hurt any more and feel like saying F *** the world . What have I done so wrong for me to be so hated . 
If there is a difference between Heaven and hell , then tell me why people have to go thru soooo much hurt & pain here ? Seems like hell is here to me . There is no way God would put one person thru all of this , and not take them from here , unless we were already in hell . 
Let's see who is paying attention .... Every single one of you are on my Friend list as a result of a conscious decision . I am not only glad to count you as friends but also as family !... Let's see who in my Friends list actually pays attention .... Copy and paste this in your status . I will be watching to see who reposts .

Tough girls come from New York , sweet girls from Alabama . But Florida girls , we have sunshine in our souls . Darlin , we can wrestle a gator , bait a hook , clean a fish , tan without burning , while eating grits at a fish fry . If we have an opinion , you know you're gonna hear it and if you don't like it -- well -- bless your heart . I love being a Florida girl ! ( Repost if you're a True Florida Girl ! ) 
Getting things ready for the Deep Sea fishing trip with Dad tomorrow .

Wishing everyone a safe and Happy Memorial Day !!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Been sick for a few days , guess < PROPFIRST > gave me that crap he had last week , just not as bad . Feel a little better today . 
The more I hear about the oil on the Gulf , and the more pictures that I see about those poor animals that can not help them selves , the more OUTRAGED I seem to become . I still think that BP should be BOYCOTTED , and forced out of bussiness . This is going to make alot of people with out jobs , Homes , and will make our Beaches unliviable for about 30 or more years . 
Waiting on phone to be fixed . Again .... \ 
< PROPFIRST>'s bday was good , and Our 8th Anniv , was good . Can't believe it's been 8 years ... 
Got pool up and going , now I am going to get in it and cool off .... Get some SUN .... Yeah ! 
Shucking and milking corn to put in the freezer , and making some home made Blackberry Jam today , then in the pool I go ... 
Getting some thunder and lighting here , logging off for a bit ... BBL 
My Grandbaby was born On June 16 , 2010 . I know the joy of being a Grandparent now , but will forever know the Pain of never being able to hold , read , laugh , cry and talk to him . \ 
Why are people so mean in life ? And , so full of Hate ? Even for things you could not control ?

Can u believe the prices at a vet . Itls 100 dollars for an xray and 800 for an emergany c-section . I tell ya , i should have went to vet school . 
I hate being sick ... Boy i am sick 
Jeez ... i want to get rid of what ever sickness i have . 
It was nice talking to my dad after about 7 yrars . My prayers arw with my Uncle Chucky and Aunt < PROPFEMALE > who both passed away the past 2 yaers . R.I.P. 
I think that if you call an ambulance to you for help , than it better be for an emergancy ... not so you can go to the hospital to be admitted so that they can dope you up on pain meds . it's people like that .. that make the ones who are in pain go with out meds . and that don't mean to make your self fall down steps so that they will give pain meds to you ... because you can't admit that you are addicted to them .

At vets office , keona still pushing , no babies yet

So far we got 4 babies 
We have 4 boys and 1 girl . I think she's done . Well i hope she's done . 
Keona settled down a little , and pups sleeping . I am finally going to bed . Night all . 
< PROPFIRST > county court system is so stupid . They can't even get papers right . 2 times . Wake the f *** up . 
Keona and her babies are doing fine . i am glad that i waited 4 years to let her have some , she's a great mom and very pertective over them . 2 of the boys have double dew claws , 2 have 1 dew claw and the last one has none . i think its cool . they sure are cute . can't wait to see if they get fluffy like her or long strait hair like < PROPMALE > . will keep all posted . 
Ummm , our cheesecake came in yesterday , from the thing you order from kids at school . Can't wait to dig in 
I am so upset ... Shoney's does not < PROPFEMALE > the good old type of sweet and sour sauce that they use to . 
It's a humid day outside today . Heading into town , to pay some bills . Joy joy ... 
Takeing it easy today .. watching Friends and eating Pizza .. 
I have learned that childeren look for affection in all the wrong places . 
To non-pet owners who visit our homes and complain about our pets : 1 ) They live here ; you don't . 2 ) If you don't ... ( reply \n\ " for next)\ 
Takeing < PROPFIRST > to his dr. Apt , feeding keona . Man those babies have their nights and days confused . :( 
We finally see < PROPFEMALE > slits in the pups eyes . We will be able to see them and them see us back in a few days . :) 
So i have really learned that < PROPFIRST > County Court House is so stupid . they gave me the wrong case # to file to reopen the dcf file . How stupid is that ? Have to re 
Headin ' to bed ya'll . TtytNight ! 
I am trying to figure out when children learned not to have respect for their elders , and when they thought that when you turn 17 that it makes you an adult wit 
I miss the days when parents wore the pants and children whom miss behaved got their butts busted . What has the world come too ? 
Dang , i guess i'm still sick . I'm hot and puking again . What ever this is can go away . :( 
Already got my turkeys and ham for the comming holidays . Yea ! 
So i was so sick last night that i drank half my chicken broth , and was in bed asleep at 6 o'clock . Hope this crap goes away . 
It's nice that people think that we have all the money in the world and we can pick someone up from the hospital and then turn around and take them back . If the persons sister is at home doing nothing , she could of taken them back . or call an ambulance to them . 
Looking forward to chinese food tomorrow for lunch . Sharon , kevin , me and < PROPFIRST > , for < PROPFIRST>'s birthday . 
OMG ! So now like Kevins dad's family want's < PROPFIRST > to sit with him all day . Jeez ... their's nothing wrong with the man .

Has anyone been to the resturant called Seminole Winds ? I want to know if it's any good . 
Yummmm , going to eat chinese for lunch today . Happy birthday < PROPFIRST > . 
Lunch was awsome , fixin to watch < PROPMALE > of Persia and Sex in the City 2 .. 
So seems that no one wants to put up with KevinLs dad , so their going to put him into some hospice place and then some place for physical rehab . his requst was a place that gives him morphine and pain pills too . now tell me , does that or does that not sound like someone addicted to pain pills ? 
Still waiting on < PROPFIRST > to come home . Watched Sex in the city 2 . Now gonna relax in a bubble bath . Only thing missing is champane and candles . 
So now i am at home alone all night , cause < PROPFEMALE > can't take care of < PROPFIRST > . See status after this one 
Hospice has < PROPFIRST > on 12 oxicotin , 12 perkocet , 10 flexaril , 10 atavan , and 20 milagrams of morphine 6 times a day . see followin 
And ; ohn has a bad heart & breathing problems . Can we say cariac arrest . Plus hospice said that his oxicotin needed to be uped . Jeez ... OMG ! 
So < PROPFIRST > took care of < PROPFIRST > all night and has not slept , then at 8:30 his sister called and said that he needed to come down and take care of < PROPFIRST > cause she can ' 
Friens and family please pray for kevins dad . He is not well at all . And those of you that i have your cell # or email addy , please check out the new pics i sen 
Hospice is on their way to pick up < PROPFIRST>'s dad . The hospice nurse said that now it's just a matter of time . < PROPFIRST>'s health has gotten worse in the past 24 hours . So he could pass away any time or day now . Please keep him and our family in your prayers . 
Hospice just got here , and the guys who came were awful . < PROPFIRST > and Aunt < PROPFEMALE > had to get < PROPFIRST > out of the house . So off to hospice we go to make sure < PROPFIRST > gets s 
We r back home . < PROPFIRST>'s in his room at hospice . Had a bath , in a gown and comfortable for the night . I fed my husband , and now it's time for him to go nite nite . 
Getting dressed and then going to hospice to see < PROPFIRST > . Then home again and take care of < PROPFEMALE > 
So we found out that < PROPFEMALE > wants a hundrend grand for this house , the gurage next door and 13 acres of land . And with < PROPFIRST > sick and in hospice , she's keeping all

Still at hospice . < PROPFIRST > is haveing some music therpy right now with a lady that can sing good and play guitar 
< PROPFIRST > was doing better this morning , but when we left he started rattling & gurgling again . Doc confirmed that it is cancer this morning . < PROPFIRST>'s not ready to give up yet and said he's gonna fight . Asked him if he wanted to see < PROPFEMALE > and he answered yes . seems to know people in the room when he's told who's there . but , he's still on the down side . 
I hope that the youngest child that i had has completly crushed me . I refuse to be hurt by heer anymore . So when ur dad screws up , don't call me to help you . Yo 
I am so tired of people that lie in court . And why do i feel like i have failed when I did all that was asked of me . And my ex never did anything ? I am so tired 
< PROPFIRST > was aproved for ssi , so West < PROPFEMALE > here we come . If < PROPFIRST > is ok , and someone is their to take care of him we r going up their this weekend to look at p 
Heading back to hospice . Was there at 7am to 2pm . Was able to get a small break . Now going back til 9 or 10 . When < PROPFEMALE > can come up there for the night . 
It's a shame that < PROPFIRST>'s dad is dieing and he requested to see and speak to his grandchildren and mine can't take time to go see him . 
Finally going home . Get about 4 hours of sleep and back to hospice we go . 
We r home at last . Bed here we come ...

Heading to hospice , up date later how < PROPFIRST > is doing . Please keep us all in your prayers . 
< PROPFIRST > and i are tired , heartbroken and feel like we have been decived . 
It's time that we do not allow what has hurt us to continue . To stop , and thank god every day that we are alive and things will be better . The hurt will go away 
With < PROPFIRST>'s breathing and stuff they say that he wont make it thru the weekend ... :( 
The nurse has told us several times that < PROPFIRST > is on the downside now . He does not respond when spoken to at all . And has stayed asleep . 
< PROPFEMALE > just called and said nurse at hospice said that it's going to be within the next 24 hours or sooner til < PROPFIRST > die's . Please , please pray for our strength du 
At hospice , < PROPFIRST>'s about the same , except that he's got a temp of 106 . Will update later 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Sellars passed away this afternoon . Please pray for our family . 
Everyone is getting together at Aunt < PROPFEMALE>'s house for a little while . maybe to go over funeral arrangements , idk . 
Lots to do today , make funeral arrangements , write out the ulegy , and talk to < PROPFIRST>'s pastor about the funeral service . That's our job today . 
I think i might of gotten < PROPFIRST > settled enough to go to sleep . He really is haveing a hard time with his father passing . 
Finally talked to < PROPFEMALE > , she was with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > said that < PROPFEMALE > will be comming to the viewing tomorrow . < PROPFIRST > would not bring her , so I hope < PROPFIRST > st 
I want to thank everone for there prayers and those of you who came to the viewing and or the funeral , thank you all so much . 
God please < PROPMALE > me patients . Please < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > collectors patients . And please give us strength . 
I found a book I want for christams . It's a daily devotional , Aunt < PROPFEMALE > has one . I will find the name of the Author later . But it's got some great poems in it . 
So our 3 week and 2 day old pupus just ate their first human food . Blueberry muffins ... they are sooo cute 
I am starting to collect flowers and ribbon and all for christmas arrangements for familys graves . 
I can not believe that < PROPFIRST>'s mom want's us to go to his Grandma's for turkey day . And wonder's why I say no 
Seems since we spent so much money this month going to and from hospice , than we are haveing a small turkey day with me and < PROPFIRST > . < PROPMALE > may come for christmas 
What's for dinner ? Hambuger steaks , green beans , and mashed potatoes with gravy ... yum 
I am headed to bed . Have to take < PROPFIRST > to the doc tomorrow . YEA !

Cleaning and packing house today . I am so excited about seeing the house in < PROPFEMALE > Hills , Florida that I just don't know what to do . 
PART 1 OF 2It sure is nice that people spend our money before we do . We are not going to live in a place that should of been condemed , nor are we going to live in a 1 bedroom 40's trailer . And we are not going to RENT something . 
PART 2 of 2And why RENT when you can put a down pmt on something that you will own . And if we want to buy something that we want .. well .. when you live in 3 years of hell , I think that we have every right to . Our priorty's are in the right place , so ... nothing more to say .

Everything in the house looks good ... except the paint job .. it's to dark 
Ok , when we buy that house in < PROPFEMALE > Hills , you know what we will need ? A HOUSE WARMING PARTY .... Aunt < PROPFEMALE > loved pic's of the house . ;)

Fixing to watch \Bee\ " Movie for the 2nd time . Been awhile since I saw it the 1st time . " 
We had Chicken Marsala for dinner , now bath time and then to bed I go . 
Why is it when a guy fix's dinner , and they ask you how it was and you tell them .... they say you are bitching at them if they cooked it wrong .. after you explain 
Man Sunday's suck ... we get so bored . We'll be so glad when we can move , at least there will be things to do . 
I'm tellin you ... I could blow some dough in Cosco .... :)
