To develop < PROPFEMALE > , you need someone who willfully hurts you . Such people give us real opportunities to practice tolerance . They test our inner strength in a way that even our guru cannot . Basically , < PROPFEMALE > protects us from being discouraged . ~ Dalai Lama 
Basically , a human being is a social animal . So , if you create some short moment of happiness for people , you get deep satisfaction . ~ ~ Dalai Lama 
Compassion is not religious business , it is human business , it is not luxury , it is essential for our own peace and mental stability , it is essential for human survival . 
Compassion is not religious business , it is human business , it is not luxury , it is essential for our own peace and mental stability , it is essential for human survival . ---- Dalai Lama

Glee'0 Clock comment : Ok . I am totally confused and it is sick and wrong to see < PROPMALE > making out with a girl . 
So the first step in seeking happiness is learning . We first have to learn how negative emotions and behaviors are harmful to us and how positive emotions are helpful . ~ DALAI LAMA 
It is maybe not the best choice to have a favorite anything . ~ Dalai Lama 
In a time of universal deceit , telling the truth is a revolutionary act . ~ George Orwell 
OMG ! It's Glee 0 ' CLOCK ! 
Glee + FLash Mob = cool . 
WOO HOO ! Prop 100 has a strong lead in the YES box ! 
Whether one believes in a religion or not , and whether one believes in rebirth or not , there isn't anyone who doesn't appreciate kindness and compassion . ~ Dalai Lama 
The whole point of transforming our heart and mind is to find happiness . We all have the natural < PROPFEMALE > to be happy and the wish to overcome suffering . This is a fact , so we can make it our starting point . ~ ~ Dalai Lama 
Hi Mom , in case you are on but ignore chat , we won't be at church today . J is at a friend's b-day and < PROPMALE > is building a bar for < PROPFEMALE>'s 50th party . That leaves just me , and I don't have anything red . love you . ;p 
Part 1-The rationale for universal compassion is based on the same principle of spiritual democracy . It is the recognition of the fact that every living being has an equal right to and < PROPFEMALE > for happiness ....... 
Part 2- The true acceptance of the principle of democracy requires that we think and act in terms of the common good . Compassion and universal responsibility require a commitment to personal sacrifice and the neglect of egotistical desires ~ Dalai Lama 
Sometimes one creates a dynamic impression by saying something , and sometimes one creates as significant an impression by remaining silent . ~ Dalai Lama 
Take into account that great love and great achievements involve great risks . ~ Dalai Lama 
So the smart brain must be balanced with a warm heart , a good heart -- a sense of responsibility , of concern for the well-being of others . ~ ~ Dalai Lama 
can't believe she skipped Glee 0 ' Clock to go see The Lightening Thief . A.K.A. THE crappiest Book-to-movie movie EVER . Upshot : was only a dollar admission at the cheap seats . < PROPFIRST>'s comment on the way out - \ I'm stickin with books . \"" 
CutNPastes : < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > is hoping all her Tucson friends are thinking about starting a tradition this August to celebrate Tucson's Birthday , and to honor Cele's vision . She honestly believed , and never doubted for a minute , that every one of us belongs in this community , and that the most important thing we can do is to connect as often and as many ways as possible . The Birthday's a time to celebrate the good stuff . 
Love and compassion are necessities , not luxuries . Without them humanity cannot survive . ~ ~ Dalai Lama 
Be kind whenever possible . It is always possible . ~ ~ Dalai Lama 
By bringing about a change in our outlook toward things and events , all phenomena can become sources of happiness . ~ Dalai Lama

Whatever forms of meditation you practice , the most important point is to apply mindfulness continuously , and make a sustained effort . It is unrealistic to expect results from meditation within a short period of time . What is required is continuous sustained effort . ~ Dalai Lama

We can never obtain peace in the outer world until we make peace with ourselves . ~ Dalai Lama 
Daughter is asking permission to watch Jaws . SO . NOT . HAPPENING . 
All forms of violence , especially war , are totally unacceptable as means to settle disputes between and among nations , groups and persons . ~ Dalai Lama 
It is not difficult to forgive destruction in the past that resulted from ignorance . Today , however , we have access to more information , and it is essential that we re-examine ethically what we have inherited , what we are responsible for , and what we will pass on to coming generations . ~ Dalai Lama 
With warm-heartedness ... there is no room to exploit or to bully others . ~ Dalai Lama 
apologizes profusely for the double , triple , KNOCK IT OFF ALREADY ! photo posts . She has no clue what she's doing . 
When a problem first arises , try to remain humble and maintain a sincere attitude , and be concerned that the outcome is fair . ~ Dalai Lama 
Gotta good friend who's 2 yr old daughter went to hospital today with high fever , breathing issues , heart issues- diagnosed with Kawasaki Disease . Mayo Clinic says it's very rare . Mostly in Asian children , and mostly boys . Leave it to this rebellious little caucasian baby girl to break a rule or two . Peeps , please do your thing- higher power stuff , energy stuff , whatever , to send healing to Baby < PROPFEMALE > . Thanks . 
As human beings we all want to be happy and free from misery we have learned that the key to happiness is inner peace . The greatest obstacles to inner peace are disturbing emotions such as anger , attachment , fear and suspicion , while love and compassion and a sense of universal responsibility are the sources of peace and happiness . ~ Dalai Lama 
The highest happiness is when one reaches the stage of liberation , at which there is no more suffering . ~ Dalai Lama 
Baby < PROPFEMALE > Update : Still in hosp . Still Puffy . Still a sick little girl . On third round of treatment . BUT ! As of yesterday evening , she finally had enough good temps in a row that she gets to go home today ! < WHEW > . WIll finish up Hosp . treatment today , then another two-month long treatment out-patient . SO , not ALL better , but Better ! Thanks to my awesome Peeps for sending Mad Healing Livvy's way . It's WORKING !! 
When I speak about love and compassion , i do so not as a Buddhist , nor as a Tibetan , nor as the Dalai Lama . I do so as one human being speaking with another . I hope that you at this moment will think of yourself as a human being rather than as an American , Asian , European , African , or member of any particular country . These loyalties are secondary . `Dalai Lama 
When I consider the lack of cooperation in human society , I can only conclude that is stems from ignorance of our interdependent nature . ~ Dalai Lama
