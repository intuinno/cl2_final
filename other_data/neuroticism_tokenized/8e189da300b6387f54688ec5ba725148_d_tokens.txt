I love how when i get a magazine it puts me in a good mood for like the rest of the week , but i can't explain why i'm so happy . 
Whatya say we go for a ride ? Whatya say we get high ? Cuz i'm so tired of days that feel like the night . 
I love a song that makes you wanna scream out the chorus and splatter your ideas across the walls so they paint a picture of your true self . 
Let's get high on < PROPMALE > supplies .

Just rearranged and cleaned my room cuz there's not shit else to do at 3 am . 
Does lady gaga's < PROPMALE > video remind anyone else of a nazi sex dungeon ? Cuz thats the vibe i'm getting . 
I'm a shade too pale for pretty and some habits I can't shake , but if you took all that away then I just wouldn't be the same . 
Just found a stash of cigarettes that i forgot about . There were three packs wrapped up in a blanket in my closet . Lmao .

Ah shit ! I went to grab what i thought was a lighter i left on my window ledge and it was a giant slug ! I almost pissed my pants !

My dad just brought me a fire extinguisher to paint . I love how he just does the randomest stuff .

Oh my god i'm in love with the spacepimps . They have a song called \true life : i wear girls jeans\ " you just can't beat that . " 
\back in the uniform and back to the sweet smell of mustard gas and killin . \ " haha i love < PROPMALE > payne ! " 
\Who lets their kid go door to door selling crap nobody wants anyway ? Where's your kid at two in the morning when i need cigarettes ?! \"" 
If you can do a tattoo so realistic and fucked up , it makes me wanna puke , then that makes you my hero . So < PROPMALE > tyrrell you're my hero . 
My dad just lit our garbage with a tortilla chip and a match . I guess thats where i learned to hold together everything with safety pins . 
Quote of the day : \Does horny count as an emotion ? Cuz I'm taking a quiz and they wanna know the emotion i have most frequently . \"" 
Jd- \Why don't you write this paper for me ? \ " \ " Why dont you grow a vagina so you can go fuck yourself ? \"" 
Just remembered how my dad used to send me up on the roof to get dog toys that landed up there . Thats good parenting . 
Oh my god . I just tossed my phone onto my bed and it started flipping sideways and flipped up the pillow and into the trash can beside it . 
I love it when me and aly have deep philosophical debates . It makes me feel like a change is coming and everything's gonna be alright .

My gramma didn't blink when she got cancer for the second time , but i saw her cry for the first time tonight . 
Haha so apparently when i was three i told my gramma she had to choose between me and her boyfriend . Started the bitchiness off early .

I am a strong believer in naps . I just woke up from one and will most likely take another before the day is out . That is all . 
I just wanna let everyone know how much I LOVE Depeche Mode . They're one of the best bands in history and one of my absolute favorites .

Where are all the sour patch parents ?! 
And she turned a whiter shade of pale . 
I think it's funny when people call me \snoe hoe\ " . Just sayin . " 
Courage is often mistaken for insanity . 
If revenge is best served cold and revenge is sweet , then revenge must be ice cream . 
Awwww :( I took in a little half blind kitten and it follows the dog around and sleeps with it . It's the saddest thing I've ever seen . 
Currently telling < PROPFIRST > stories . Let's hope I don't scar him for life . 
Mr Pibb is the slacker of the soft drink world , whereas Mr Pepper went to Harvard and became a doctor . Time to man up Pibb . 
So Glee pretty much butchered < PROPMALE > Horror with all the editing . You just can't take the sex out because that's what makes it so great . 
Just styled my brother's wig for Halloween . Watching shows about drag queens finally paid off . 
Personality test results:\You're comfortable with your sexuality . You're always surrounded by hoardes of minions & fans . You're an artist . \"" 
Thinking back to when me and Aly used to sit on the stairs behind the library and smoke like a couple of hipsters . Those were good days . 
\What color are < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE>' eyes ? \ " \ " Blue with flecks of insanity . \"" 
I think the reason that kids like me so much is because I look more like something they imagined than a real person . 
Quote of the day : \It's like my vagina brought you guys together . \"" 
That pan has nice acoustics ... Mind if I pretend to play drums on it ?

I just wanna let the world know how much I love < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Durbin , and that I wouldn't know what to do without him . He makes nights like tonight bearable and always knows just what to say . I love you Tigerlilly . 
It is my dream to put the nastiest porn I can find in the DVD player hooked up to all the tv's in best buy . And it would be the best moment of my life if a little kid was trying out the 3d tv display right when it came on . 
Why is it that sleeping on the other side of the bed is such a drastic change ?! 
If a prostitute gets raped , does that also count as shoplifting ? 
Music , to me , is magical . It's biochemical electricity . It's that split second where time stops and all the air leaves your lungs right before the roller-coaster speeds downhill . It's not knowing what's google to happen , but trusting that everything's gonna be fine . Ohhhh I wish you could feel it . 
We're no longer confined because yesterday I burnt the sky . 
Up and waiting for Tigerlilly to call . Got a huge day planned ! 
< PROPFEMALE > wrapping paper + glitter ribbons = amazing ! \ 
\ 
( Except when me , < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFIRST > actually try to wrap a present with it . ) 
It never ceases to amaze me I get paint in my hair every time I paint . Pretty sure I might've even gotten some on the cat this time . 
Well I don't know what I've been told . Never slow down , never grow old . Tired of screwing up , tired of going down , tired of myself , tired of this town . 
You know you've got a friend when you can mute animal planet , narrate it and think it's hilarious while you're both sober . 
The reactions I get when people see me walking around with a rabbit on a leash kinda make me feel famous . And I must say that I like it . 
Laying in bed watching The Sword In The Stone with Aly :) 
I dreamt about you last night and it was just like old times . \ 
I miss you . 
Note to self : Don't fear the reaper .

< PROPFEMALE>'s going through my closet and trying on my hooker shoes . We'll see how this develops . 
So my hair dryer just decided that it would rather die than finish drying my hair . My straightener's officially on suicide watch . 
Oh my god ! Stop sending me friend requests !!! After four rejections you'd think they'd take the hint ! 
I teeter on the edge of functioning .

I'm dreaming in technicolor . 
The difficulties of having long hair :\ 
1 : Spending ten minutes trying to wind it up and stuff it under your hood before going out into the rain\ 
2 : Shutting it in windows and doors\ 
3 : Accidentally dragging it through stuff like paint or your drink 
So most people would buy gum on an impulse ... I just bought furniture . 
Just had a < PROPMALE > epiphany about the rest of my life if the form of a dream that I just remembered from last night . Kind of excited about it .

\I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints . The sinners are much more fun . You know that only the good die young . \ " - < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > " 
Damn I love it when people bring me cool shit ! Just got some old sound board equipment ! 
I'm to the point where spending two dollars on nail polish is a < PROPMALE > financial decision . 
Oh , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > , I'd pay to see you frown . 
\Ever since we met I only shoot up with your perfume . It's the only thing that makes me feel as good as you do . \"" 
Had a fantastic first day of work today . 
\I'd he put all of his intentions towards good instead of evil he could've cured cancer and killed every cockroach in Mexico ! \"- Diddles " 
I just wanna listen to Iron Maiden for the rest of the day . 
So I just found out that I'm going to college for three weeks as soon as school's out and I'm really hoping that < PROPFIRST > will take care of < PROPFEMALE > and Zeus for me . 
Does anyone else feel like a complete moron when you're stuck at a red light at night and there's not another car in sight ?.... I totally didn't mean for that to rhyme . 
To the sock who just wants to < PROPFEMALE > out in the dryer instead of reuniting with his brother sock : fuck you . 
Whooo !!! It's Jd's birthday and it also marks the end of my one year ban from donating blood ! Haha great things are happening ! 
I also forgot to announce that I found a < PROPFEMALE > turtle today and named him < PROPFIRST > Manson , because this bastard is fucking manipulative . 
An old woman in a wheelchair came into work yesterday and bought a sword . Underneath that cat sweater beats the heart of a warrior . 
On the back wall of the ambulance bay at EMS there's a huge x painted that says \ 
\Brian hit head here\ " above it . " 
I fell asleep last night reading a book about Sigmund Freud . That pretty much ensured crazy dreams . 
I don't like how they changed the friend request \ignore\ " button to a \ " not now\ " button . I'd much rather push a \ " fuck off\ " button . " 
\I've got two tickets to Iron Maiden 
\I wonder what would happen if I just changed pants right here . \ " \ 
It's storming and we're at the drive-in . 
Haha so I find that picture of < PROPFEMALE > Duke that I posted yesterday extremely ironic now . My timing is impeccable . 
So my dining room table is now an operating table and I'm performing typewriter surgery . 
\She just put the fear of god into my boner . \ " \ 
\Since you're new today I'm gonna cut you a break . Do why don't you make like a tree and get outta here ?! \ " #backtothefuture " 
I miss my habit of sketching things in the margins of my papers . I think tomorrow's going to be devoted entirely to doodling . 
I hate pseudo spiritual people .

< PROPFEMALE > and Kole came to see me at work today and Kole tried on assless chaps while < PROPFEMALE > bought a new cage for her rats . Lol\

Has anyone else ever woken up from a nap thinking they were late for something or just in a general state of \confused as fuck\ " ? I totally just did . "

Watching Gremlins ! 
I'm utterly depraved . 
Song of the day : \Men Are All The Same\ " by The Used " 
These children are about to be decapitated . It's too fucking early for this . 
Of course the one time that I go out without makeup I see like eight people that I know . 
It's about to get a little Pulp Fiction-y in here . Song of the day : \The Figurehead\ " by The Cure " 
Lmao my dad is watching Roll Bounce and he just turned to me and said \This reminds me so much of when I grew up a poor black kid skatin in the inner city . \"" 
So in a spur of the moment decision or decided to dye the bottom layer of my hair blue . I have to wait until tomorrow though because my mother used all of my bleach . 
Watching \Sid and Nancy\ " because I can't sleep . " 
The smell of hair bleach reminds me of my childhood . Not exactly sure what that says about me . 
You've gotta love a song that makes you wanna get stoned in slow motion . 
I have a feeling that if I went maybe three days without brushing my hair I'd have full on dreads . I don't wanna find out though . 
Lmao I was driving behind Jd earlier when < PROPFIRST > suddenly opens the trunk ( which he is inside ) and sits up and flips me off then he just shut the trunk again . 
\She's coming over wearing genocide \"" 
* kicks guitar over*\ 
Aly- \I'm sorry ! I was trying to be like that guy without arms that does everything with his feet ! \"" 
I saw Priest tonight and the city looked exactly like the setting in my dreams almost every night . Kinda freaky .

\I need to live in dreams today . I'm tired of the song that sorrow sings . \"" 
Song of the day : \Nothing Lasts Forever\ " by < PROPFEMALE > & The Bunnymen . One of my all-time favorite songs . " 
Sometimes paranoia's just having all the facts . 
The flea market is like my damn Christmas . 
Earlier I sat with a woman at her booth and listened to her story about how her son had gone on a road trip and met The Misfits and her husband kept trying to get me to buy a movie projector .
