I have a new phone and unfortunately , no < PROPFIRST > . -_- 

Goodbye 2010 . Hello 2011 . 
I want ice cream . 
Watching a Bollywood movie , Devdas . :) 
If one doctor doctors another doctor does the doctor who doctors the doctor doctor the doctor the way the doctor he is doctoring doctors ? 
geez . i'm lost on this facebook thing , lol . 
Okay , so I finally got a Facebook , butttttt I have to get use to it because I'm super super lost . =/ 
Out of my mind . Be right back . (; 
When you're bored ... get a tootsie pop and see how many licks it takes to get to the center of the tootsie pop . (; 
If someone annoys you , it takes 42 muscles to frown , but it only takes 4 muscles to extend your arm and whack them in the head . 
\Who are you calling a cootie < PROPFEMALE > ? You lint licker ! \"" 
I can't believe I just woke up and walked to my bus when it's only 3:30 in the morning ! Lmao ! Wow . I'm special . 
I want jerk chicken ... for some odd reason . (: 
Before you use the bathroom in someone's house , make sure you check they have toilet paper !! 
If God sneezed , what would you say to him ? 
Make cupcakes , not war . 
BEDTIME ! :) 
Love isn’t only blind ; it’s also deaf , dumb , and stupid . 
Sorry , but my < PROPFEMALE > just ran over your dogma . :) 
It's hard to soar like an eagle when you're surrounded by turkeys . 
I know you think you understood what I said , but what you heard was not what I meant . 
Never underestimate the power of human stupidity . 
I'm going to watch Food Network now . I'm hungry . (: 
Watching the new Suite Life on Deck . Love that show ! :) 
I do whatever my rice krispies tell me to . (: 
Anger is one letter short of danger . 
I just came back from piano lessons and I'm hungry ! Time to raid my refrigerator . (: 
Well , I guess I don't have to raid my fridge anymore . My mom's making spaghetti ! Yaaay ! 
My mom HATES flowers , chocolate , and < PROPMALE > bears . But , she LOVES money , jewelry and perfume . Wow , lol . 
You can pick your nose and pick your friends but you can't wipe your friends on the couch ! 
I had a dream last night , I was eating a ten pound marshmallow . I woke up this morning and the pillow was gone . =) 
Last night I played a blank tape at full blast . The mime next door went nuts . 
To love is to suffer . To avoid suffering one must not love . But then one suffers from not loving . Therefore to love is to suffer , not to love is to suffer . To suffer is to suffer . To be happy is to love . To be happy then is to suffer . But suffering makes one unhappy . Therefore , to be unhappy one must love , or love to suffer , or suffer from too much happiness . I hope you're getting this down . 
My hair is so .... stubborn . Geez ! Goodnight ... for now . ^_^ 
Why do people pull my hair like it's a rope ? I mean , I don't care if you touch my hair , but don't break my neck in the process , lol . 
I can never pay attention in class . I'm always doodling ! How can I stop this habit ? <_< 
Why do people gawk at me when I say I want to go to an all-women's college . Geez ! Close your mouth before I spit in it , lol . 
Only those who attempt the absurd can acheive the impossible . 
Someday your < PROPMALE > will come . Mine took a wrong turn and is too stubborn to ask for directions . 
\Love's a two-way street and I think your car just died . \"" 
Keep your friends close , keep your enemies tied up with fishing wire in your basement . 
I'm hungry ! 
I think my sister is losing her mind . She's hunching the air ... :/ 
Everyone has the ability of making someone happy , some by entering the room , others by leaving it . 
They keep saying the right person will come along ; I think a truck hit mine . 
I'm getting a car ....! Whooo hooo ! ^_^ * moonwalks in chair * 
I CANNOT believe I'm going to be a senior soon . I still look like a freshman ! Actually .. I still look like I could be in middle school . Oh well , lol . (: 
Children always know when company is in the living room - they can hear their mother laughing at their father's jokes ! 
I didn't go to piano lessons today . I wouldn't be able to focus with the cramping I'm expriencing . Stupid red ninja ... 
Making reservations for a college visit . Whooo hooo ! I'm leaving Florida soon . (: 
Change is inevitable , except from a vending machine . 
Listening to < PROPMALE > Marley and eating Cool Whip . ^_^ 
I don't mind going nowhere as long as it's an interesting path . 
If you can't be kind , atleast have the decency to be vague . 
I hope I feel better soon so I can go to piano lessons tomorrow . ^_^ 
Even if you are on the right track , you'll get run over if you just sit there . 
I eat when I'm bored soooo , how about some popcorn ? ^_^ 
Practice safe eating - always use condiments . 
You're getting old when you get the same sensation from a rocking chair that you once got from a roller coaster . 
Why can't I swallow a stupid pill ?! -_- 
I don't get even . I get odder . (: 
Eating pound cake ..! Yum , lol . 
I don't know what your problem is , but I bet it's hard to pronounce . -_- 
I like you . You remind me of when I was young and stupid . 
A bicycle can't stand on its own because it is two-tired . 
Crying is blackmail . (-_-) 
I've been in my bed all day . I hope I feel better soon . Soon as in the next 24 hours soon . ^_^ 
Ahhh ... I see the screw-up < PROPFEMALE > has visited us again ... 
Flossing . ^_^ 
I hope I feel better tomorrow . (: 
It sounds like English , but I can't understand a word you're saying ... (-_-) 
I think I'm obsessed with smileys . 
Show me a piano falling down a mineshaft and I'll show you A-flat minor . 
Ever stop to think , and forget to start again ? 
I discovered something today .... I want to be a ninja ! ^_^ 
I wish I could be everything I want to be ; an astronaut , an artist , a musician , a philanthropist , a dentist , an elephant trainer/zoo keeper , a cinematographer , a mom , etc . But , unless I live until I'm 100 something , I won't be able to do them all , lol . 
In the beginning , there was nothing . Then , God created the ninja in His own image . (: 
In Natoma , Kansas , it's illegal to throw knives at men wearing striped suits . Lol ! ^_^ 
I had a laugh attack during 6th period . I laughed for 15 minutes , lol . <_<

When I woke , the first thing on my mind was FOOD ! (: 
I love laughing at other people's laugh . Random , but true ! >.< 
I was driving with my dad today and he had his head down . So I was like .... \Dad . What are you doing ? \ " And here's what he said : \ " I'm praying cuz Lord knows you're gonna send me to my grave . \ " <_<" 
You're validating my inherent mistrust of strangers . <_< 
I think I need my glasses to take a shower . I can never find the soap , lol !

Better to be with no one than to be with the wrong one . 
Heaven is not for people who are better than the rest . But for people who sincerely try to become better than they are . 
Time to get ready for church . (: 
If you look inside a girl's heart and see how much she cries . You'll find secrets . Promises and lies . But what you'll see most is how hard she tries to stay strong . When nothing's right and everything's wrong . 
You are my sunshine , my only sunshine , you make me happy when skies are gray , oh dont you know dear , how much I love you , so please don’t take my sunshine away ! 
Always laugh when you can . It's cheaper than medicine . (: 
A played out love song playing in the background seems to describe every part of what we are now . 
Do I turn left , when nothing is right ? Or do I turn right , when nothing is left ? 
Uooh . I see a rainbow . ^_^ 
I like kids , but I don’t think I could eat a whole one . 
I need to stop drawing when I'm bored or else I'll start drawing on my walls . -_- 
I try to keep my conversations in my head , but .... I can't . =/ 
Do dentists go to other dentists or do they just do it themselves ? 
I need to buy a new video game . I'm getting bored . -_- 
Do you remember when you were young and you wanted to set the world on fire ? 
You make mistakes that erase when you smile . (:

It took me almost 10 minutes to open a bottle of Pepsi . Wow , lol . I even bruised my hand in the process .

Playing UNO with < PROPFEMALE > Archer and Jakia Stitt ! ^_^ 
Don't tell me the sky's the limit , when there's footprints on the < PROPFEMALE > .
