People need to understand that children with special needs don't have an illness , so there is no cure & it's not contagious . They only want what we all want , to be accepted . 93% of you probably won't copy and paste this . Will you do it and leave it on your status for at least an hour ? It's Special Education week , and this is in honor of all the kids who need a little extra help & understanding .

can type 83 words per minute . I never took a keyboard class or whatever , so how did I learn to type so fast ? I started instant messaging women , which subsequently led to disagreements , which subsequently led to the most bad-assed amateur typer in the history of silly crap . 
Dear Time , I can't be in a relationship with you any longer . It's the overwhelming impotence and unprovoked daily sobbing , it's too much . You make life feel terrible to me and I'm nauseated when I look at you .. Plus , I've been having sex with procrastination ... I can't bear the guilt and pain and stress any longer . When I am through writing this letter , I will end the life that you destroyed for me . 
Click \LIKE\ " if I have ever made you smile . Set this as your status message and see how many people you have made smile . :) " 
Find me in the fields and meadows , laughing mirthfully beneath you or regretfully falling above you . Your weights and responsibilities will never catch me and the rustling leaves will ridicule your efforts . Shed your vestal livery and join nature in its splendor .

If one boycotted every related thought by a thinker who was prejudice , we would be morally obligated to boycot all culture and greater thinking . No human being among us is perfect and even if most thinkers were perfect , doesn't it stand to reason that one can learn great things from evil , such as an example of immorality ?

today at work , I worked a double shift . I've never worked a double before . The end of my first shift , someone shit on the wall of theater three . Yes , you read that right , they eliminated feces onto the wall . At the end of my second shift ( right before I was counted out by management ) a fist fight broke out ... in theater three . What the hell is wrong with you theater three ? What the hell ...

\Everything's perrrrrrrrfect ! Rainbows and sunnnnnnnnshine ! \ " - Beckah < PROPFIRST > 2008 " 
HUZZAH 
No Strings Attached was a fantastic movie that had me laughing every 5 minutes , and yet it was still not half as lovely as the divine < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Jones , whom I had the privilege of spending my day with . That's right friends of < PROPFEMALE > Jones , be jealous , especially you , < PROPFIRST > Kerr . 
has a scab on his scalp from the sign incident , yesterday . The world needs to be more accommodating to us tall folk and make street signs high enough to walk under ! 
Be my < PROPFIRST > ! 
used to be so beautiful/ but [ he ] lost it somewhere along the way 
predicted a significant plot twist in a relatively complex book he's reading . HUZZAH ! 
< PROPFIRST > Sanderson's Mistborn trilogy was fantastic , by far the best fantasy novels I've read in a long time . If that's your cup of tea , pick up a copy , you won't regret it ( unless you have bad taste ) . 
was up until six watch \The Usual Suspects\ " ( again ) " 
loves < PROPFIRST > Kerr more than he loves any breakfast cereal . 
ain't got no home/shoes/money/class/scarf/gloves/bed/pot/faith 
saw 2 awesome classmates , a handful of ex-students , had a conversation with a stranger about Opera/Ballet and exchanged phone < PROPFIRST > , practiced driving , found 5 packs of Birch Beer and Peppermint Ice Cream and bought both , and is making a delicious pork chop recipe right now . Life is fantastic . 
is being vertical 
I love music . 
the longer someone spends time with me , the faster the probability that I'll say something stupid approaches one . 
What should I do today ? ( When I'm not practicing ) 
\The odds of getting praise from my father are lower than [ the odds of ] meeting the pope's wife ... in a submarine . \ " - < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > " 
had an absolutely miserable experience at a mass < PROPFEMALE > choir rehearsal . Never again .

is a hypocrite 
would rather be a sparrow than a snail , would rather be a hammer than a nail . 
fuck this , I quit , I'll try again tomorrow . 
don't need no doctor for his prescription to be filled . 
I had a dream I jumped from the roof and you caught me , I jumped from a tree and you caught me , I jumped from a cloud and you caught me . Why am I jumping off clouds when I'm afraid of heights ? How are you catching me and not dying ? Why was I afraid to dance with you ? And WHAT THE HELL did I SMOKE/inject/pop/snort/take last night to have such a bizarre dream . 
won't look for shooting stars . 
had a dream his brother got married ... in South < PROPFEMALE > . 
finished another book ... as usual at 7:30 am 
Willkommen , bienvenue , welcome . Stuck forever in my head . 
if anyone sees me awake ( ie posting on facebook ) after 1am for the next month , I want you to slap me in the face . Legit . My body is trashed from these crazy hours I'm keeping . I'll bake cookies for anyone who can help me ... by slapping me in the face . 
MAKE A WISH !

unintentional Last Five Years allusion in last post . WOW 
prepare to be amazed by my peppermint chocolate chip cookies . 
joined a gym ! 
' s favorite lessons in life are those that teach him to be a human being of poorer character , and that being < PROPMALE > or having integrity will earn you demerits and concealing the truth and being unhelpful in general will reward you with prestige and material goods . 
operation \actually go to the gorram gym\ " was a success . No taking a crack at mission \ " squeeze in a session and actually practice before work ARGH\ " is in effect . (+5 pts to people who got the awesome culture allusion ) " 
Sysyphus-Ummagumma is a total acid trip 
HUZZAH ! Mat Dunlop 
was less than 6 inches from his first car accident earlier tonight . An extremely intelligent person in the right < PROPFIRST > decided to make a U turn across a four < PROPFIRST > high way . In the rain . At night . Anyway , god bless my father for pointing the careful driver out to me .
