Although I often reminisce , I can't believe that I found\ 
A < PROPFEMALE > for true love floatin around\ 
Inside my soul because my soul is cold\ 
One half of me deserves to be this way til I'm old\ 
But tha other half needs affection and joy , \ 
And tha warmth that is created by a girl and a boy . 
And she live in that mindset that I could never move to\ 
Until you find yourself , it's impossible to lose you\ 
Because I never had you , although I would be glad to\ 
I'd prolly go and tattoo your name on my heart\

My girl's got that ghetto love . \ 
Cause I'm tha night rider , \ 
And tha sole provider . \ 
Gotta change tha game\ 
Dippin off you ain't tha same\ 
My girl's got that ghetto love . 
What I need is simple , 5'5 with dimples , potential wife credentials . Know about tha life I'm into , life I've been through , and how I had a triflin ' mental . 
You used to hold me , told me that I was tha best\ 
Anything in this world I want , I could possess\ 
All that made me want is all that I can get\ 
In order to survive , got to learn to live with Regrets .. 
I want tha finer things in my life , so I hustle .. 
I'm tha type of guy that says puddin is delicious 
Cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her , and a real man jus can't deny a woman's worth . 
I treat tha cash like tha government treats AIDS ; I won't be satisfied til all my nigas get it , get it ? 
I plant my seed in her garden , and now she root for me . 
All I want to do is love you right , take my time . Read between tha lines , girl . 
Because I never had you . Although I would be glad to . I'd prolly go and tattoo .. your name on my heart . I swear .. I start .. to think , that I'm goin crazy . 
YES I AM WEEZY BUT I AINT ASTHMATIC !! 
Overtime , overtime , I put in for that < PROPFIRST > 
Forever chasin ' that first feelin ' . On a quest for a woman's treasure ; they keep it hidden . I gotta find love even if it kill me . Could run into it any day , but knowin ' me I'll prolly never meet . 
If it wasn't for the money , cars and movie stars and jewels and all these things I got .. I wonder , would you still want me ? 
Baby , you wintertime cold . The night is still young , drinking dinner wine slow . I'm tryna make the goosebumps on your inner thighs show . I'll let you beat me there as far as finish lines go . 
Rinse your eyes with holy water . No I ain't gon take her , I know that's his only daughter 
Trying to convince myself I found one , making tha mistake I never learned from . 
I'm havin nightmares from sleepin with tha enemy .. 
I'm really tryna make it more than what it is , cause everybody dies but not everybody lives . 
What's love if we don't fall in trust ? 
Can I , can I ... save you from you .. 
She could be on magazines , but she ain't really into that . 
I'm still sittin ' here alone ; we shoulda did this already . 
ain't got a love to call steady . Hope it ain't like that for long 
If it's one thing I know , it's smokin ' and livin ' large . 
All night I've been starin ' . Can < PROPFEMALE > tell , I want you . 
I don't give you tha time you deserve from me . This is somethin ' I know , I know , I know . So tonite , I'll jus fuck you like we're in < PROPMALE > ; takin ' everything slow , so slow , so slow . But I do it to her ... 
wish it , want it , do it . 
In My Zone . 
Big house , long hallways , got ten bathrooms , I could shit all day 
And when you think you like it , I promise you gon ' love it . When tha lights comin ' through tha drapes and we both yawnin ' , I roll over and ask if ... 
Tha Boss of my own shit , I'm in charge . Only one goal , live life , live large . 
im a beast , im a dawg , i should rap wit a muzzle . drought 3 
give me some dro , purple haze and some chocolate . Give me a dutch and a lighter , ill spark shit , and stay high all tha time , i smoke that good shit . im high all tha time , man im on some hood shit . 
This is my December\ 
These are my snow-covered trees\ 
This is me pretending\ 
This is all I need . 
Ferrari lifestyle , that mean I'm livin ' fast . On tha road to riches , you don't slow down , you give it gas . 
From your ankle bracelet to your belly ring\ 
From tha tat on your back with tha angel wings\ 
Starin ' at your mouth waitin ' to hear anything 
The rage of tha menace ... 
My anaconda don't want none unless < PROPFEMALE > got buns , hun ! 
Tonight I want me a wonder woman .. 
So can you do me a favor , if I pull it together , make it sooner than later . We won't be here forever and I realized I waited too long , but please don't move onn . You don't need no one else ... 
Yeah , tha crazy , tha wizard . \ 
So much whiskey all in my liver \ 
I really like the punch it delivers , \ 
makes me warm while I high-five sinners . 
Yeah , we on it . Give a fuck about your lifestyle , give a fuck about a mothafuckin ' lifestyle ' cause niga , we live this shit . 
And I've been thinkin ' how can I get away . It got me thinkin ' bout a perfect day . 
If I can see tha stars in your eyes , then your soul must be a miracle , Sent from tha skies . no lie , I try , it's more than physical . connected to tha mind , our love is spiritual . if love is a mix , combine them all , we are a chemical . 
whats a bullet if you dont got a gun . 
Lames catch feelings , We catch flights . Jet life until tha next life . 
To make everybody happy , I think I would need a clone . 
twist it , bite it , light it . 
yesterday i fell in love . today feels like my funeral 
So misunderstood , but what's a world without enigma ? 
know you're missin somethin , i wish i was what completed you . 
woman of my dreams , i dont sleep so i cant find her . 
All you gotta do is come real 
i feel like dying ... 
no ceilings , mothafucka , good morning ! < PROPMALE > in ya mouth while you're yawning , im goin in . 
But what if we happen to kiss , then we touch\ 
Put a rush on it , get it over with\ 
What if I know jus what you like\ 
And it feels right , then it's over with\ 
What if I don't call you back , prove you right\ 
And all this lasts jus one night\ 
Maybe we should slow it downnn . 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas to all , and to all a good night * 
I'm prolly in tha sky , flyin with tha fishes or maybe in tha ocean , swimmin with tha pigeons . See , my world is different ... 
Tha truth is an offense , but not a sin 
I never loved a bitch , I only loved tha moments 
new year , new women , new money . 
I'm spaced out , dawg , I be on that < PROPFEMALE > talk . I wonder if God asked < PROPFIRST > how to < PROPFEMALE > walk 
Hands down , I'm too proud for love . But with eyes shut , it's you I'm thinkin ' of . But how we move from A to B , it can't be up to me , cause you don't know who I was before you . Basically , to see a change in me , I'd be losing , so I jus ignore you . But you're on my mind .. maybe in time .. 
ain't cause I need tha money , it's cause I love tha hustle 
tha good times today are tha sad thoughts of tomorrow . 
I keep thinkin of you , I keep , I keep thinkin of you 
It's becomin somethin that's impossible to ignore .. 
if you were a secret , how long could you keep it ? 
I want things to go my way , but as of late , a lot of shit been goin sideways . 
Watch it my niggas , I'm tryna be calm but I'm gon ' get richer through any means , with that thing that < PROPMALE > palmed in tha picture . \ 
Never read tha Qu'ran or Islamic scriptures ;\ 
Only psalms I read was on tha arms of my niggas . 
Now even though I try to play it off\ 
I’m thinking about you all day long\ 
And I can’t wait for shorty to come through
