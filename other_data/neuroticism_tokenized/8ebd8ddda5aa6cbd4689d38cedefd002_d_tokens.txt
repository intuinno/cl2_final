I absolutely love Redemption now . The music might be amazing , heavy ( really ) and well-played ... but their LYRICS are the best part . I think about them for the rest of the day when I hear Redemption . Plus , < PROPFIRST > Alder is the perfect person to sing with ... \ 
\ 
Bottom line : \Snowfall on Judgement Day\ " is a classic album . 70 minutes that didn't bore me for one second . One of my 12 favorites of all time . " 

Pray for my friend < PROPMALE > . Thanks to the video you see below , he might be knocking on God's door soon . That last step , though , is the hardest ... help him . He wants to find the Lord ... and only where he is now can one experience such a powerful change . Pass this on ... 
I officially debuted my new hot sauce today , although it had been done before ... it wasn't named yet . \ 
Containing profuse doses of potent habanero peppers and garlic sauteed in < PROPFEMALE > oil , with lemon juice and < PROPFEMALE > vinegar shooting through the pool of heat , this is something those nasty bloodsuckers will die from just thinking about . This is ... VAMPIRE HELL . \ 
( Subtitled : And you thought just garlic was effective ... ) 
If you believe in Jesus Christ , put this on your wall . Do not just ignore this . \ 
In the Bible it says , if you deny Me in front of your peers , I will deny you in front of My Father , at the Gates of Heaven . This is a simple test . If you love God and you are not afraid to show it put this on your wall . Respect . \ 
( From my cousin . I'm also developing a new Interactive Musical Journey , relating more directly to this ... ) 
VIRUS\

koobface . It will steal your info , invade your system and shut it down ! \

requestsyou , don't accept it ; it is a virus . If somebody on your list\

I came down with a 102 fever yesterday after one of my final KSW classes before Saturday's tournament ... and now this morning it's now 104 ! I might not be able to make it to the last practice on Friday , and possibly even the tournament itself !! I spent a non-refundable $80 registering , five months getting ready , and now this ... \ 
Anyone , particularly from Kuk Sool , should be hoping or praying that I recover very soon . 
Almost no illness at tournament , and I ended up with FIVE medals (!) - 4th in forms , techniques and staff , 3rd in sword and 2nd in sparring - due to a dearth of competition . 2nd was HARD-WON - and not in the expected way . If you want details , message me ... \ 
Not heard results from any students , so maybe we DIDN'T win ?! 
Come join me ! - I'm in a LIVE video chat with 4 other people at http://tinychat.com/jesusissexy 
Been sending a bunch of e-mails around to some of the people who aren't reading their friend requests ... if you know me , make sure you check your request box , because I might be there ! I've got almost 70 pending requests , and I need some cleared up because Facebook doesn't like that too much ... 
is basking in the post-listen to the 2nd Kekal album - \Embrace The Dead\ " . Extol is the only other band that can elicit such powerful religious experiences - and this might even have surpassed some of those listens . I never thought I could feel such emotion ... we can't feel such happiness without a powerful source of it . \ 
has finally received something that can't easily be found ... a ( fairly rare ) Power of Omens T-shirt . For $12.77 . This band was incredible , and has enthusiastically supported my promotional efforts . I'll be delighted to wear this shirt in support , and for fun ... God bless these guys . 
has also received unlimited upload status , like many others ! Non-partners will get this if you have no violations and \play by the rules . \ " \ 
Belt testing at Kuk Sool tonight from 6:15 , and tomorrow from 11:45 AM . Brown Belts and higher are eligible to assist as a technique partner and/or with judging . \ 
This is an easy , convenient way to develop assisting and judging skill in a positive environment ; we must all learn this eventually . We've needed YOUR help lately due to very large student attendance . Your help will help us , but also help yourself . 
< PROPFIRST > , < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > , etc : I may go live on BlogTV in about 30-40 minutes with somebody showing interest tonight . Post here if you want to come ! 
< PROPFIRST > , < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > , etc : Same deal again , but I have a bit more time . Post here if you want to come ! 
May have live show when < PROPFIRST > gets off the phone . Respond here when you can ! 
After several weeks of work , I have passed 100 push-ups ! Finished last night's nightly failure run with 101 . \ 
And I only had 38 a few weeks ago ... 
The Manipulator General's Tagline of the Day ... \ 
Tourniquet's \Microscopic View of a Telescopic Realm\ " : This album proves God exists ! ( It's even better when I'm wearing the album's T-shirt ... ) " 
is now DONE with CCLP3 ! Thanks are in order to Believer's \Dimensions\ " album ... :D " 
was listening to some of Shadow Gallery's \Tyranny\ " between classes 
wonders why MyFriendSecrets has two different answers for whether I am tone deaf . 
VERY frustrating school day . Had to use a laptop and touchpad mouse to type my in-class English essay , which continually clicked in the wrong spots and made Word 2007 completely mess up my essay formatting , such that I barely finished on time ... and when I reached gym to play the Echoes album as arranged today , Coach was absent and the sub only played the music for 6 minutes ... 
Yet again , Prof . Odneal was absent from music class , leaving me dead time from 11:30 to a 1:45 appointment with my English teacher ( which ended up being at 1:25 ) . Fortunately , Ayreon filled in almost all of it with \The Human Equation ... \ " \ 
headed downtown to eat at my favorite Chinese restaurant , which was no longer there ! Fortunately , someone was walking by and told me it had moved across the block , and then someone else was exiting what turned out to be the new place and convinced us to try it ! It's run by the same people - just cut back to its noodle-shop origins instead of a restaurant . \ 
Sometimes God just sends us help through guardian angels :) 
Part 2 : I had loaded the first Twinspirits album onto my Sansa , and wasn't intending to listen to any more than the first track ( on the way over ) to test out the sound of the songs on it ... just kept listening until Soren < PROPFIRST > and then couldn't stop ! Listened to it all ... but unfortunately , the $7.38 copy of the actual album on Amazon was gone when I got home . :( 
St. < PROPFIRST>'s Day corned beef sandwiches with ... Ajvar ! This stuff has captured me and won't let me go ... 
is very annoyed when I give people my e-mail address and ask them to be SURE they e-mail me , and then they don't . 
wonders why < PROPFEMALE > Tata will get a criminal trial with all the customary stages when she fled from the police all the way to Nigeria ! There really should be some sort of change to that effect ... 
is being absolutely dominated by the Hemina songs for the last couple days . If the rest of the upcoming full album is even close to these , this will be at LEAST classic Dream Theater caliber . Twinspirits might just have someone to watch out for in 2011 ! 
I've already got two Likes for MYRATH ! :) \ 
If you liked what you heard below , vote for their appearance in Atlanta's ProgPower USA 2011 !
