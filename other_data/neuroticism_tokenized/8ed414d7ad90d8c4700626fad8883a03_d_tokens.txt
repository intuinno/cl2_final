Woke up to more of the white stuff this morning ! Looks like a good day to read by the fire . Saw 2012 last night . No one told me the target audience was a ten year old boy ... really dumb ! 
Back home from Park City . Had a wonderful time with my girls , sons- in- law , grandaughters . Hope everyone had a great holiday .

The islands are GORGEOUS now that the rain has finally stopped . I took a drive down memory < PROPFIRST > in Montecito after attending a funeral at Mt . < PROPFEMALE > . What a beautiful place I call home . 
Had a fantastic bike ride up Figueroa Mountain Road in Los Olivos today . A bunch of us met at Ballard School and had a picnic when we got back . The scenery was spectacular . Bucolic hills with cattle , oak trees , and lots of wild flowers . ( Thank God for my spinning classes ) 
We are off to Idaho Falls tomorrow .. so excited to see < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > and their infamous YARD ! 
Just got back from a gorgeous evening in the mountains of < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > . We live in an incredible place . Deer , goats , coyotes , peacocks , 1.5 < PROPMALE > up the hill and a BBQ to top it off . 
The snow just keeps coming ! I have never been in this much snow . Good thing I am on vacation with lots of good books and plenty of food in the fridge .
