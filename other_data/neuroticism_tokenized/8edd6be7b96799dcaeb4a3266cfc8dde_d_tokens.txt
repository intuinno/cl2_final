Some one just asked me what do you give some one who has and can get anything they want ... my response I had a friend like that and I thought it would be funny to buy him a deer that shits jelly beans . ( If you knew the guy it was halirious , I almost peed my pants when he opened it , he is very dry , but very kind ) .. but maybe don't take my advice , he's not my friend anymore ... still my best gift ever given !!! 

My car wreak was so bad I cry looking at the pics , I cant believe I am still here !!! Guess GOD has his reasons ..... I have a broken streunm , finger , toe , and some bruised ribs . Happy BDay month to me ! At least no one else was hurt !
