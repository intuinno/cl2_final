He's not pining , he's passed on . This parrot is no \ 
more . He has ceased to be . He's expired and gone to meet his maker . He's\ 
a stiff , bereft of life , he rests in peace . If you hadn't have nailed \ 
him to the perch he'd be pushing up the daisies . He's rung down the \ 
curtain and joined the choir invisible . This is an ex-parrot ! 
You don't have to be beautiful\

I just need your body baby\ 
From dusk till dawn\ 
You don't need experience\ 
To turn me out\

Year after year , no matter how much time has passed\ 
On this day , it seems like all we do is cry\

Never forgotten , but on this day we relive the past\

Hates being sick ! 
Hates when people abruptly end a conversation just because the conversation isn't going exactly the way they want it to . Come on people it's called acting like a semi mature adult ! It's really not that hard ! 
Damn you fever . BE GONE ALREADY ! I'm so over this cold ugh 
Misses Mt high and everyone there ! This stupid cold won't go away ! 
Can't sleep 
is watching The Kennedy mini series :D <3 
Wait what more snow to come to Wrightwood this weekend ?! O_o

Somewhere between all our laughs , long talks , stupid little flights , and all our jokes ... I fell in love with you . 
Orientation today ! 
Still sick FML 
uuuggggghhhh being sick has ruined the end of the season for me :( :( :( 
still feels awful and has class all day , all week :( 
sooo tired :( still a < PROPMALE > sick too 
is finally starting to admit that she deserves better than this ... 
Is getting fed up 
pig >_< 
Happy Easter ! 
job searching can kiss my bum 
stressed , exhausted , annoyed .... 
Semi over it 
Having such a bad day >_< 
The normal boobs ( . )( . ) , the silicone boobs ( + )( + ) , the perfect boobs ( o)(o ) . Some boobs are cold (^) (^) , and some boobs belong to grandmothers \\./\\./ And let’s not forget the very large boobs ( o Y o ) , and very small boobs (.) (.) and lastly the asymmetrical boobs (•) (.) . We love them all ! Post this message on your wall and say ??? (?_?) ??? to breast cancer . SAVE THE BOOBIES ! \ 
- TOGETHER WE CAN !!! :) ... 
Is tired of people making drama for no reason . Seriously what's the point ? If there's an issue be mature about it and stop making a bigger deal out of it . It doesn't make you look cute , it just makes you look idiotic . Grow up . 
Happy < PROPFEMALE > wars day ! ^ \\_/ ^ 
Happy cinco de mayo ! 
perhaps a change is needed 
Happy Mother's Day to all the moms ! 
hates when people say they're going to do something and don't and then come up with excuses about why they didn't do what they said they were going to do >_< 
Like my status and I'll tell you :\ 
1 . how we met :\ 
2 . my first impression of you :\ 
3 . what I like about you :\ 
4 . favorite memory of you :\ 
But , if you like this , you must put it as your status ! 
Is thoroughly annoyed 
15-year-old girl holds her 11-month-old son . \ 
People call her a slut . \ 
No one knows she was raped at 13 . \ 
People call a girl fat . \ 
No one knows she has a serious disease which causes her to be overweight . \ 
People call an old man ugly . \ 
No one knows he had a serious injury to his face whilst fighting for our country during the war . \ 
Re-post this if you are against bullying and stereotyping . \ 
Bet none of you will ..... 
I have a personal reason for asking if everyone could put this as their status for 1 hour . I'm pretty sure I know the ones that will . Think of someone you know or love who has had cancer . My wish is that in 2011 a cure will be found . Will you post it for 1 hour . To honor those who have fought or are fighting cancer . Hope to see it in your status 
State certification exam today .... nerves are kicking in already :-/ 
Omg state certification exam in half an hour ... I'm soooo nervous !! 
Paper work is finally finished being processed and groups have been selected . My written exam is about to start * crosses fingers * 
Woot passed the written . I'm half a CNA lol now for the practical portion of the state exam ! Yikes ! 
Is officially a Certified Nursing Assistant !!!!!!!!!!! Thanks everyone for the good luck wishes !!!! :) :) :) :) 
is ridiculously sick .... again 
Just realized that I can video chat via skype with my iPhone ! Swweeeet !!! 
when God closes a door , he always opens a window ... so why i am desperately trying to make various things work out . things shouldn't be overly difficult to complete , especially when you're giving it your all . perhaps i should just except that the door may already be beginning to close and start looking the open window . :-/ 
Dear Job Market , \ 
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU\ 
<3 , Bessell 
<3 Fruit's Basket <3 
job searching can suck it 
hates the double standards that some people have ... seriously get over yourself and stop playing the damn victim especially when you're not ! here's an idea think about how you treat others and how that affects them before getting all butt hurt . 
I AM A HANDFUL - ( unfortunately most women WON'T re-post this ) I'm strong willed , independent , a bit outspoken , and I tell it like it is . I make mistakes , I am sometimes out of control and at times hard to handle but I love and give with all my heart . If you can't handle me at my worst then you sure don't deserve me at my best . If you are a HANDFUL , re-post ! I dare you 
Still sick ugh I feel awful ! 
Might go to mammoth next week if I'm not sick * crosses fingers * 
Wants to be romanced to the point that I feel an abundance of love that bursts through my every being . 
Still sick T_T 
Got her phone back :-D yay 
Wants to see the new pirates of the Caribbean ... mmmmm < PROPFIRST > depp mmmm yummmy 
I think Saturday being the end of the world is bogus . If you're a believer in the Bible , Jesus clearly says no one knows the hour of the time of the return . Seriously people if God hasn't told Jesus , he hasn't told me or you or anyone . 
if you never hear from me again after tomorrow perhaps i'm among the missing and you've been left behind BAHAHAHAHAHAHA 
If < PROPFEMALE > Palin gets elected president , I'm moving to a different country ! 
lost my phone FML 
watching mama mia with my mama :D 
boredom and insomnia hit again ... surprise , surprise 
>_< stupid allergies 
stomach aches suck >_< 
Happy Memorial Day ! 
pulled my left groin muscle slightly >_< 
People say stress changes people ... no sorry I think stress brings out who people really are . 
woot woot calc starts today :D math is fun 
FFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU WINDOWS LIVE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Just got back from dog herding training :) my dogs are so awesome ! 
Copy and paste this if your DAD is in heaven . If roses grow in heaven Lord , then pick a bunch for me . Place them in my dads arms and tell him they're from me . Tell him that I love and miss him , and when he turns to smile , place a kiss upon his cheek and hold him for awhile ..... for me .

For < PROPFEMALE > M Diehl : A person has 1000 wishes . A Soldier only has one , to come home safe . I know 97% of you wont post this as your status , but the 3% that do are my friends . In honor of someone that died or is fighting for your freedom , please repost this . l 
gleek ! :D 
Heavenly Father , walk through my house , take away all my worries , Heal all illnesses in Jesus Name Amen . Make yourself at home in my house and in my heart , Please watch over , heal & comfort , my family , my friends in Jesus name , Amen . This prayer is so powerful . Stop what you're doing and set this to your status , and watch what He will do ..

Mountain High season pass party , who's down ? 
facebook has now teamed up with skype ... wtf facebook is taking over everything 
anyone want to buy a pair of 7 sized pair of women's thirty-twos ? they've been used once for like less than 8 hours ... 
Can anyone tell me why it is so hard to pray , but easy to swear ? Why clubs are growing and churches are shrinking ? Why it is so hard to re-post a Christian status , but easy to post gossip ? Why we can worship a celebrity , but not Jesus ? Gonna ignore this ? The Lord said , if you deny me in front of your friends , I will deny you in front of my Father . Re-post this if your not ashamed of Jesus 
Is winter here yet ? 
miss wrightwood :( 
??? (_) ??? this class ugh two more days of pain >_< 
just took my history final ... totally killed it 8-) 
i wanna go < PROPMALE > jumping >_< 
There's a reason why people say we shouldn't expect too much , no one wants to see someone they care about end up disappointed . We instinctively act to protect our own from being hurt , and do what we can to make the right choices for people we love . But the reason we have expectations in the first place , is because we want to aim as high as we can . Because when you love someone , there's no limit to what you can accomplish . 
Tough girls come from Texas . Sweet girls come from < PROPFEMALE > . Prissy girls come from New York and then there's them CALIFORNIA girls , fire and ice in our blood . We can ride a 4 wheeler , be a < PROPFEMALE > , throw a left hook , pack heat , bake a cake , fish w/the boys , love with a passion , and if we have an opinion , you bet you're gonna hear it . Re-post if you are a Cali girl and proud of it !!! ? 
<3 math 8-) 
Kids with Special needs aren't weird or odd . They only want what everyone wants .... to be ACCEPTED . Can I make a request ? Is anyone willing to post this and leave it on your status for 1 hour ? It is Special Education week & Autism & ADHD Awareness month , and this is in honor of ALL children . Brothers and Sisters , we all need help sometimes . 
is exhausted 
the new google picture-art is awesome .... looooove it 8-) 
totally ate it on a ramp today ... busted my bottom lip slightly ... reminds me of epic shred sessions at Mountain High ... is it winter yet ? 
spent the last two hours on one math problem ... reminds me of all the good times in the SMC math lab with fellow tutors like < PROPFIRST > Njuguna Ng'anga 
<3 math :D :D D 
< PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > is awesome 
[( Cups of coffee + # of Monitors ) * 10 ] ( Your Age - 20 ) + [( Number of Facebook friends - 100)/10 ] + ( Facebook Events * 10 ) - ( Facebook Pages * 10 ) - ( Facebook Games * 10 ) = Total Current Awesomeness . LOL 
Love is patient , love is kind . It does not envy , it does not boast , it is not proud . It is not rude , it is not self-seeking , it is not easily angered , it keeps no record of wrongs . Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth . It always protects , always trusts , always hopes , always perseveres . Love never fails . \
