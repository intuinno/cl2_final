o well , i still love you < PROPFEMALE > 
somethings wrong with me , apparently im no longer my self , and i've been feeling that something bad is about to happen 
got my new glasses today , my headache got worse cuz my eyes need to adjust to them , hopefully my headache goes away , if not , oh well then , i'll learn to live with the pain 
< PROPFEMALE > much pain , somebody make this headache go away before i do something to stupid to end the pain 
bored , im on day 34 with a headache , and yet i still had a pretty good day . \ 
well , i guess i can't complain , my day was pretty much well balanced 
talked to the navy recruiters today , played football with the naval recruits , maybe i'll join , but im still not sure yet . anyone have any thoughts as to whether or not i should enlist ?? 
what the hell is wrong with me ?? today i woke up in a negative mood and i don't know why . 
now its over . i gave her everything i had , but i guess it wasn't enough . im done trying , now im gonna go and see if there's anything left of the old me worth saving 
i hope what happened is for the best , cuz it feels like the worst mistake of my life 
well , i guess it was a good end to a bad day , hanging out with skinny sure made me feel better 
i feel numb on the inside , hopefully tomorrow will be better , after all , it is gonna be a new day 
yay !!! i found my rubberband :) 
skillet and thousand foot krutch , what more can i ask for right now ? these guys freaking rock !!!! 
hanging out in the band room with < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > was fun today , i wish that could happen more often 
day 41 with a headache , i think im starting to get sick , but overall , i had a pretty decent day 
hmmm , day 42 with a headache , and my ibuprofen isn't working , maybe i should increase the dose or quit taking it , decisions , decisions 
stargazing with < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE > was fun , we should do that more often . unfortunately , i still have my headache :( , day 44 here i come 
overall , it was a good day , but i still have a headache :( . at least the pain isn't as bad as it was this morning

My cousin just made me an epic sammich 
Thanks to my X chromosome , i was able to reverse engineer a sammich after watching my cousin make one , but it still wasnt as epic as the one she made for me 
ok , day 51 with a headache , concert tomorrow , doctor appointment on monday , new phone on tuesday or wednesday , and < PROPMALE > potter on wednesday ... im gonna be busy 
Bless the fall was sick , now to wait for Atreyu 
Atreyu is freaking awesome live 
Great way to finish the night , Atreyu and Bless the Fall really helped me feel better , and they kick ass live 
Sweet I got my new phone today :) 
Finally went to the doctor to see what was up with my head 
Finally a much needed break especially after being hyper all day :) 
Wow . i've been hyper all day , yet my headache just gets worse , what the hell is this crap ??? 
hahaha , i just remembered that while i was hyper this morning i was acting like chipmunk 
i can't believe that it took a day of being hyper for me to realize how empty i feel inside , how im nothing more than a shadow of who i used to be 
damn it , sleeping meds didn't work so good , i didn't sleep much , i cant wait till i watch < PROPMALE > potter though , its the only thing im looking forward to today 
just watched < PROPMALE > potter and dathly hallows , and it was freaking epic !!!!!!! 
Happy Thanksgiving guys , have a great day , and enjoy the food you eat 
'' Lobster killer , lobster killer '' 
Overall , great Tanksgiving dinner , i hope everyone else enjoyed their dinner , or will enjoy their dinner , as i hav enjoyed mine ! :D 
something doesn't feel right ... i wish i knew what it was so that i can fix it 
something is still wrong with me , oh well , i guess i'll just get used to it 
pretty good day ... i got an acoustic guitar and i went and watched < PROPMALE > potter again with < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , and Lexi .... it was a pretty epic night hanging out with them 
i know life sucks when playing guitar can't help me feel better :( \ 
maybe it really is time to just give up on trying to be the person i used to be ... maybe its time to just let go , and become someone different , whether or not i'll be someone better is still unknown to me , but i'll try to make the most of it 
well , im gonna try something different , instead of just playing guitar , im gonna try to write a song ... lets see how well that goes 
finished writing my first song , now i have to find a good strum pattern for it and edit it 
im done with my first song !!! i feel accomplished now 
now that i've finished my first song , i think i might write another one :) 
just finished writing my second song , know i have to write the guitar part for it 
ok , third song is in the making 
YES !!!! finished my third song ... both lyrics and chords 
ok , i cant think of what to write right now , so instead of writing more songs , im gonna learn how to play \yours to hold\ " and \ " seize the day\ " on my acoustic and \ " becoming the bull\ " on my electric " 
hahaha , thank god i can always count on this amazing person called < PROPFEMALE > to make my day better ... to make all my troubles just float out the window and leave me alone for a while ... long enough for me to feel a little bit better . THANK YOU < PROPFEMALE > !!! you're the best !!! :D 
well , life pretty much sucks right now ... oh well , i still had fun hanging out with < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > , and jessica ... and i learned not to get a ride from < PROPMALE > if i don't want any injuries ... over all it was a good night , now to think about all my problems and ways to solve them 
Technology hates me today 
pretty good night , went bowling with some friends , had fun , then dinner at Dennys . overall a really good night , now im slightly hyper 
something feels ... off , like something bad is gonna happen ... maybe im just going crazy .... 
So bored ... somebody plz save me from this boredom !

Decisions , decisions ... 
well facebook , since you wanna know what's on my mind , i'll tell you ... i can't seem to get her out of my mind now , and just thinking about her brings a smile to my face . :) 
< PROPFEMALE > bored , anyone wanna < PROPFEMALE > out ?? 
Note to self : dont drink coffee 
i really shouldn't be allowed to think :( 
Guess who's going to the hospital ... me :( 
Well , im checking out of the ER now , doctor says I should be fine within 48 hrs if I take these new drugs 
Well im of to bed , i gotta take my meds ... hopefully i feel better in the morning 
I had an ok day i guess ... i was mainly working off of my pain killers ... but the game was fun , i got to < PROPFEMALE > out with two of my favorite people even though one of them was late :) 
i feel accomplished :) 
So apparently I have two types of headaches , and the doctor is going to run some blood tests , and yet another pain killer , but atleast it takes me of the vicodin 
some people just dont get it .... 
wow , just when things seemed to be going so well , my world starts to crumble again 
wow , i feel like a weight has just been lifted off my chest ... i feel free again 
Wow , im in a really good mood today ... not sure why , but I like it :) 
How weird .... 
whats on my mind tonight ? well lets see ... i like her sooo much , yet i can't tell her , why , because im afraid . im afraid to lose one of the greatest friends i'll ever have , afraid of being hurt , im afraid that if i do tell her , i'll just end up losing her , that she'll just walk out of my life and forget all about me :( 
Sometimes I feel like I can predict the future ... it'd be nice if the things I predicted were actually good thing 
what would be a good song to describe who i am ?? 
Now I remember why I dont sing ... I have a terrible voice 
today was a really good day , lets see what tomorrow brings 
sometimes i wonder if being happy is worth the risk ... for some reason happiness and i dont mix well anymore 
like my status and ill tell you one truth about you . Dare you to put it as your own ! ( sorry if i don't reply to it immediately ) 
there goes my day ... and to think it was going so good , i guess all good things do end ... i just wish i could have had a little more fun , oh well .... its freaking freezing outside !!!!!
