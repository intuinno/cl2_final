I need everyone's prayer for our granddaughter Madi . She is in O.R. Hospital , she scratched her eye yesterday and is having problems opening her eye , but the main cause is her white blood cell count is up to 23 , 000 , they are looking at the cavity in her lung again and also her Thymus Gland . Pray for God's healing of this 2 year old .

in Frisco Texas @ Texas Tornado Hockey Tryout with < PROPMALE > this weekend . He looked good in the first session last night , he has a full afternoon and night schedule today . Then a morning session tomorrow and hopefully an allstar game tomorrow afternoon game . 
< PROPMALE > had a good early afternoon session , letting in only 1 goal . He looked good in the goalie session later that afternoon . Had a rough outing in last nights game though , letting in 5 goals . Pray that this morning sessions goes better for him , he was alittle embarrassed by last nights game . Gonna have to come out firing on all cylinders this morning . 
< PROPMALE > was told he was a solid little goalie & out played some of the older boys , but they were looking for size & older boys . What a pitty , this kid had more talent than some of the boys who made the all-star team . We will not give up , more tryouts in the future for this kid . 
2 < PROPFIRST > 3:17 -18 - Ye therefore , beloved , seeing ye know these things before , beware lest ye also , being led away with the error of the wicked , fall from your own stedfastness . But grow in grace , and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ . To him be < PROPFEMALE > both now & for ever . Amen !

The greatest gift I ever had , came for God ; I call him Dad ! 
Blessed indeed is the man who hears many gentle voices call him Father ! 
Bearing with one another , and forgiving one another , if anyone has a complaint against another ; even as Christ forgave you , so you also must do . Colossians 3:13 
We are trying to find < PROPMALE > a hockey team to play goalie for this season . Getting tired of hearing about the size thing . He is as good as any I have seen at these tryouts we have gone to . He just needs the door to open to show what he can do ! 
It is in the quiet crucible of your personal private sufferings that your noblest dreams are born , and God's greatest gifts are given in compensation for what you've been through . It is well with my soul . 
Food for Thought . ( 1 ) Free you heart from hatred . ( 2 ) Free you mind of worries . ( 3 ) Live simply . ( 4 ) Give more . ( 5 ) Expect less . Hope you have a blessed weekend ! 
There is one who speaks rashly like the thrust of a sword , but the tongue of the wise brings healing . Prov . 12:8 
I've learned : ( 1 ) That having a child fall asleep in your arms is one of the most peaceful feelings in the world . ( 2 ) That just one person saying to me , \You've made my day ! \ " makes my day . ( 3 ) That money doesn't buy class . ( 4 ) That the Lord didn't do it all in one day . What makes me think I can ? ( 5 ) That no one is perfect until you fall in love with them . " 
I've learned : ( 1 ) That sometimes all a person needs is a hand to hold and a heart to understand . ( 2 ) That its those small daily happenings that make life so spectacular . ( 3 ) That under everyone's hard shell is someone who wants to be appreciated and loved . ( 4 ) That when you plan to get even with someone , you are only letting that person continue to hurt you . ( 5 ) That love , not time , heals all wounds . 
Rules of Wisdom - ( 1 ) As a child of God , prayer is kind of like calling home every day . ( 2 ) Blessed are the flexible for they shall not be bent out of shape . ( 3 ) The most important things in your home are the people . ( 4 ) Laugh every day , it's like inner jogging . ( 5 ) A grudge is a heavy thing to < PROPFEMALE > . 
I've learned : ( 1)That no matter how serious your life requires you to be , everyone needs a friend to act goofy with . ( 2 ) That life is like a roll of toilet paper . The closer it gets to the end , the faster is goes . ( 3 ) That we should be glad God doesn't give us everything we ask for . ( 4 ) That everyone you meet deserves to be greeted with a smile . And you never know , you might get one in return . 
If your Gospel , isn't touching others , it hasn't touched you ! 
Taking < PROPMALE > to one more tryout in Albuquerque tomorrow & Sunday . Hope he makes this team so we can can concentrate on something else . 
Got back from Rio Rancho , < PROPMALE > has some decisions to make , the teams not going to be a AA team , only going to be a A team , and probably not going to play as many games or go to Nationals this year , big disappointment for him . Probably going to stay home and play for the < PROPFEMALE > team , and hope for next year . 
God understands our prayers even when we can't find the words to say them ! 
I have always loved music . To this day , songs help unlock the part of me that is most yielded to God . It helps me declare my love for him and my praise to him . But as the psalmist says , at night , especially on those nights when sleep is hard to come by , his song is with me . Amen ! 
Come on folks , let's keep it clean . 
Waitin ' to here from a coach up in Niagra Falls , Canada about a goalie position for < PROPMALE > to play on , hope it's a good response for him ! Good Luck < PROPMALE > ! 
< PROPMALE > was offered a contract by the league president of the Continental Jr. Hockey League , to either play in Erie or Indiana , Pennsylvania or Syracuse , New York . < PROPMALE > said he would let us know which team he will report to . He will leaving in three weeks . Thank you Lord for answered prayers . 
Talked to Coach Cashman today , looks like he is headed to Niagra Falls , Canada . We will know for sure tomorrow . < PROPMALE > signed his contract today to play . Got the passport ordered today & sent $ 6,000 . 00 dollars to play hockey in Canada . Looks like he will be leaving in two weeks . Now I have to find him something to drive . 
Well its official , < PROPMALE > is headed to Niagara Falls , Canada to play hockey . He has to be up there by Sept . 28th , season starts October 16th . His team is called the Niagara Falls Fury . 
Well < PROPMALE > got his passport today , he is set up to leave Monday morning for Niagara Falls , Ont . So much to get done before Monday . The moving < PROPFIRST > is at Mom & Dad's house packing for Florida . They are leaving Saturday morning . Seems like everyone leaving us behind . 
Walk worthy of the Lord , being fruitful in every good work . Colossians 1:10 
Cultivate this day for it contains the seeds of tomorrows harvest . 
< PROPMALE > had a good weekend in Michigan , they went 1 & 1 against the Alpena Thunder losing the first game 6-4 Saturday night , he faced over 50 shots in that game and came back Sunday to win 5-3 against 35 shots . So proud of him , Michigan State coach & a few others told him he played a good game . Just wish we could have been there to watch , really missing getting to watch him play . 
Whatever you accomplish in life it will be done on your knees . Totally dependent upon the Holy Spirit . You live moment by moment in total dependency upon him , sensitive to his voice in our life and obedient to him . Amen ! 
I think if they should fire < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > too . He ran the offense and they sure aren't producing either . The coaches can only coach the players , its up to the players to play the game and accomplish what they are supposed to do . I would like to see < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > purchase the cowboys myself , then maybe we could get a team . 
Gettin ready to take < PROPMALE > back to < PROPFIRST > & put him on a plane back to Canada at 9:45 am in the morning . Got to leave about 3:00 am to get there by 8:45 am . Gonna make for a long day tomorrow . Mom & Dad leaving tomorrow to back to Florida , gonna miss them being here .

My comfort from God : When you pass through the waters I will be with you ; and through the rivers , they will not overflow you . When you walk through the fire , you wil not be scorched , nor will the flame burn you . For I am Lord your God . < PROPFEMALE > 43:2 -3
