Going to gymnastics tonight I guess . I'm not looking forward to it at all . I haven't been there in two months but I miss my team <3 
So I was standing outside after school and Mrs. Craft told this kid to get off of the edge of the sidewalk . Then she said , \Maybe it would be better off if you kids got hit ! \ " wtf . " 
Oh my gosh ! I was getting some cereal and I reached up in the cabinet to get sugar to put on it . But of course , the sugar fell , hit my head , and the bag ripped . Now the kitchen floor and MYSELF are covered in sugar ! Lmao .

French class today : \The word for pool is piscine . So don't piscine in the piscine ! \ " - Mrs. Lawson ;) Haha " 
Is it summer yet ? :| 
The dumb thing about this number game is that the person you're talking about ends up \liking\ " it anyways . So I don't see why they don't just post it on the persons wall or something . The news feed is ridiculous . " 
I love having my big guy friends surround me after school to block the snow ! :D And then there's < PROPFIRST > , skin and bones . Haha 
Just got home from < PROPFIRST>'s loud and chaotic house where kids keep coming from nowhere . I'm pretty sure he has no idea how many siblings he actually has . 
I have done nothing , and I mean NOTHING , all day long . So now I'm going to watch Sweeney < PROPMALE > and then Disturbia . Good night 
I hate it how most of my friends are already turning sixteen , and I'm not even fifteen and a half yet . I can't wait to drive . 
I've seriously watched like twelve movies over break already , and now < PROPFEMALE > bought me lucky number thirteen for Christmas that she just dropped off . I guess I get to watch Labyrinth tonight ! ( : 
I'm seriously freaking out ! My Uncle is the \Stickman\ " on the radio and he is interviewing < PROPFIRST > McCartney and gets to see him perform live . And guess who he's taking with him ?! ME ! :D " 
So I fell today after school when I was with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > . Then Mrs. Lawson said I could get money from the school if I got hurt . So I decided to lay back on the ground and pretend to be in pain . Mrs. Lawson and I are splitting the money because my leg has a big gash in it :P 
I hate it when weird foreign guys try to add me . Especially when all of our mutual friends are girls . Hmm , wonder what that could mean ... I'm clueless :P 
Just got home from hanging out with < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > . We broke the inside screen of my phone and I kept complaining that I couldn't read the texts I was receiving . About thirty minutes later I realized I could have just read them on my outside screen :P 
I always look forward to seeing people fight about the Steelers on their status on Sundays . Lets go Steelers ! 
< PROPFIRST > Wunsch- \So whatcha up to ? \ " \ 
No school ? Really ? I'd rather have it now than make it up in the summer when I actually have something to do . 
I'm never getting on facebook during the Super bowl everrr again . Annoying as heck .

So I finally decided to stop being lazy and go get my temps today . I passed the actual test but failed the eye sight test because I didn't have my contacts . So I had to get those and drive all the way back . Plus it has been raining all day so what a pretty picture I took . Haha , not . 
My best friend < PROPMALE > and I just bought girl scout cookies with are boy scout shirts on . Haha :P 
Being happy doesn't mean everything is perfect . It means you've decided to look beyond the imperfections <3 
This weather better stay nice for Me and < PROPMALE>'s camping trip this weekend ! We're pulling an all-nighter and throwing pop bottles with Mentos in them into the fire like last time . And sleep in our hammocks up in the trees . We love our weekends at the lake ;) 
Lucky me gets to sleep on the cold ground in a tent possibly during a snowstorm for the next two nights . Joy . At least I'll get to live off of s'mores:) 
You know you are dedicated to your team when playing capture the flag when you jump off of a fifteen foot high < PROPMALE > into freezing cold water just to get away . We are all covered in bruises/cuts , and will be pulling thorns out of faces for weeks . Such a fun camping trip though :) 
Today in church I started thinking , and after a persons date of birth on a tombstone there is that little dash . Who knew that little dash could represent so much . That dash represents your whole lifetime . I am here to be happy , and I will live everyday like it's my last day <3
