\Went outside my house I went down to the deli\ 
Is this the real life ? \ 
Is this just fantasy ? \ 
Caught in a landslide\ 
No escape from reality\ 
Open your eyes\ 
Look up to the skies and see\ 
I'm just a poor boy ( poor boy ) , I need no sympathy\ 
Because I'm easy come , easy go\ 
little high , little low\ 
Anyway the wind blows , doesn't really matter to me , to me 
\All because of you 
\In fields where nothing grew but weeds 
Just got home from < PROPFEMALE>'s , biscuits and gravy are sooo delicious !

You are missed .. 
Big lizard in my backyard\ 
Can't afford to feed him anymore\ 
Bustin ' down my neighbour's door\ 
\ 
I bought a big lizard\ 
Only a dollar fifty\ 
Well , that's pretty neat\ 
Yeah it's fuckin ' nifty\ 
But I just can't afford to feed it\ 
And you should see the way it shits 
Go try a Tropical Tango smoothie today ! 
I'd slap a cancer kid . 
\I walk the thinnest line\ 
The dentist . 
A misanthropic anthropoid with nothing to\ 
Say what you must , do all you can , \ 
Break all the fucking rules and\ 
Go to Hell with Superman and\ 
Die like a champion , yeah hey ! 
And when my friend and I were done\ 
We went to rest upon the sun\ 
Cause life takes from us the things we love\ 
And it robs us of the special ones\ 
And it puts them high where we can't climb\ 
And we only miss them all the time\ 
And we sing :\ 
Life is shit , life is shit\ 
The world is shit , the world is shit\ 
This is life as I know it\ 
This is life as I know it 
Watering plants ... quenches their thirst ! 
Smoothies are too good ! 
Think positive . 
What if this whole crusade's a charade 
I need something to do !!! 
If every < PROPFEMALE > was torn from the magazine would cash still drive the media machine ? 
Off to work i go . 
I'm sick of hearing about the haves and the have not's . 
I'm thinking tomorrow is gonna be a good day . 
Everyone go look at the sky , it is crazy ! 
It's mellow . 
Is there anything going on tonight ? 
When will the world listen to reason ? I've a feeling it'll be a long time . 
You never know . 
Today was kind of lame ... ish 
We're all immigrants and hypocrites , delusionals and sycophants 
Good skate sesh today :)
