Dragons are nearly unstoppable , and in case you didn't know , they can breathe fire . 93% of people won't copy and paste this , because they have already been eaten by dragons . 6% of people are sitting in the shower ..., armed with fire extinguishers . The remaining 1% are awesome , and will re-post this . Will you ?
