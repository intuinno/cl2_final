Good times ...

Nitemares about going back to middle school . Registering < PROPFIRST > feels like I'm going back . I hope he's ready . 
Meteor showers last night & tonight supposed to come from a comet named after a some people , but the showers are named after the constellation Perseus . Persied Meteor Showers . We'll see ...

Babies & a cow-bell . 
We all woke up 15 minutes before < PROPFIRST>'s bus passed . * phew . That was close . 
Yay !!! Finished the laundry ... let's see if I can get anything done in my room .... 
The freaking chat list won't go away !!!!! 
< PROPFIRST > is driving me nuts . He thinks he's a teenager already . We got up on time , but he couldn't find his id until the last minute when all of us were looking for it . Other than a pop on the back of the head , what do you other mothers suggest ? 
Well , I worked out . Sort of . I walked to the gym . I did some stomach crunches with light weight reps and leg work and arm work , all in 15 minutes , then i walked back . Now , where's my < PROPFEMALE > Garcia ! 
If you need an alarm , you can borrow my mom . She has a cow-bell and a mardi gras flapper noise maker if that doesn't get anyone's attention . Cow-bell's aren't the best way to start your day . 
Should I go the gym ? 
< PROPFEMALE>'s just gonna deal with no legs . I can get rid of the pregos look , but after that : abstract and/or blending background here we come .... maybe the gym ... after ... 
It's Lony's birthday !!!

We went to the French Market today . It was nice enough . Got a great deal on perfume . 
FB sucks , I just tagged everybody on \15\ " & it just lost them ... & *$#@." 
Aggravation . 
Why am I up now & already aggravated ? Because I have a kid in the 6th grade ! He just sprayed some smell good stuff I bought him and I think I need gas mask . Geez . Moderation ? 
... tummy hurts . 
is awake , but still tired . Who sent the toilet seat , and the set of balls ? I don't want to send that to anyone . It's funny , but who wants their friend to send them that ? 
Dammit ! < PROPMALE>'s boss called me to ask if he could work late . That's Patooeeee !!!! Apparently , he can't get in touch with him . 
I need a haircut . 
Weekend just sucks giant fantastical buckets of bugs It has nothing to with sick kids , making anything better or anywhere in-between . Just ignore me . I'm just beiing all moody & shit . People are ( insert a very nasty thing here ) * not you or anyone that's in any way connected to FB . Btb , Evanescence rocks when you're(collective ) very very mad !! PG-rated for the liberally impaired . it has to come on now ... My Immortal ...

Is a lump(not as big as a gumball , but smaller than a pea ) on the left side of your lower abdomen with bruising around it really that bad ? My dad says it'll be fine & my mom wants to call the doctor . No ER suggestions please . Doctor's say that all the time . I'd think I might know if I was dying in the near future . I know I have at least a couple of nurses on here . I gotta lay down . [ Acronym ] Thanks !

Car broken . Anybody know anyone that can fix a clutch today ? 
Car issue aside , I'm wondering if anyone remembers my 13th surprise party . I know < PROPFIRST > Wright & < PROPFEMALE > , but they hardly ever answer . I don't know who else on here was there . Anyway , my dad had put out rat poison & it ended up being a scavenger hunt for rats ! So embarassing . A few days ago , I walk outside the back porch door an there's a cute little DEAD rat . Found another one outside this AM . COD Poison . Special me .

Happy birthday to the e , not me . 
I have a sore throat , sore back , a little nasal congestion , +a dad that thinks I make-up stuff so I don't have to bathe my mom who left for Aunt < PROPFEMALE>'s almost without telling me . I love my mom . Just don't feel well . My horoscope was right . I was shutdown before I could say no , i'm sick . It also said I should talk to him , but he won't letme . I cry all the time . I'm trying so hard , but at the same time , it's nearly impossible . 
Between < PROPFIRST > & < PROPMALE > I don't even need to watch the game . Let's just update . Status : Dad's still dad . Mom's hallucinating that she has a baby again . I'm still sick with some kind of nasal infection . I think . Oh yeah , & I'm still taking random pics . Mostly , of myself . :P 
Time to hide from the Butchmaster . Wow . I just nicknamed an imaginary bully-man that used to be my dad . Times sure are a changing ... 
There's the tornado sirens again ... what's up with that ? It's not Thursday . I think someone's been hitting the \Someone's spotted a tornado or one headed to/in St. < PROPFIRST > Parish\ " button a lil too quickly . " 
I'm going to lay down . I can't afford to go the hospital . Period . 
Good morning , all . I'm just a bit beaten up looking this monring . My nose is swollen , my underarms hurt & neck/back . Otherwise , I'm peachy . How are u today ? 
My head hurts really bad if I stay up too long . Not like a head ache bad , it's like a bruise on my < PROPFEMALE > or something . I mean , i guess it's bc all of the airbags deployed . 
Gotta go re-new my lisense . This is a hassle being that I have to ask my dad or a ride . OFW . 
DMV found a way to screw me out of it saying I didn't turn in a licencse plate from a car I got rid of in ' 03 . BS . So , not only am I without a car for the moment , I have to find $225 to give them bc they said I didn't turn it in & bring a letter to 1of their offices that do that sort of thing stating that the plate has been canceled . I hate the DMV . I better not find out I'm paying for the same shit from 2005 . 
All I know is that I don'know nothing .... all I know is tht I don't know ... 
Come on , E ... just take it easy ... 
Just take it easy ... 
Come on , E . 
Circles & circles & circles & around again ... 
I am always here to make you laugh . Come on , E . 
You're so ( way ) last summer ... 
I don't understand most people , but it doesn't make me love them any less . I just don't understand , when I realized how much better life is without certain stress-factors like my mom thinking she was pregnant this AM , my son's hw , just everyday things a woman should be able to handle . I'm just unequipt to handle certain situation without feeling that in some way , I did something . 
Justwoke up from a really awesome Dream . Was nominated to test this spaceship . Everyone was jealous . On the way Home ; which was Ruston for some reason , with < PROPFEMALE > Brown . I met her at her truck . I don't even know if she has a truck . I was running to get back to it . Met a dog that liked me and let him pet him on the way . Found the truck when I came out of the dark alley I seemed to be in . 
< PROPFEMALE > ALERT ... 3 year old BOY taken in ROCHESTER , IN by a man driving a MITSUBISHI ECLIPSE plate number 98B351 ... Please put this as your status so it moves all across face book . YOU WOULD IF IT WAS YOUR CHILD !!!! 
I think cow-bells should be permantently banned from this house !!!

I got 25 bucks & a cracker do you think that's enough to get me there , but what if i were a mermaid with those jeans of yours with her name still on them , but i don ... t care bc sometimes i hear my voice & i've been here ... 
my cat's confused about me typing . he has never gotten in my lap when i'm typing . he's about to bite me bc i'm not petting him . poor baby . he's so old . it's must be too cold outside for him , i think that's why he's confused . he's purring so loudly . i <3 < PROPMALE > . i <3 my dog , too . she always inside , tho . spoiled rotten , always eating < PROPMALE>'s food . bad < PROPMALE > . the weather's really nice . < PROPMALE > doesnt think so .

Go Saints !!! 
I forgive little things like not telling me where he went for 5 hours until he got home when he was supposed to be at his dad's . Little things that he knows really chap my hide ... we still argued , still said stupid things . We still woke up & loved eachother . I gotta say , tho . He can't keep this kind of thing up . I'm too old to put up with worrying about where my fiance ' is ... when the solution was so easy . 
Someone's been upkeeping a zoo for me ? How's that even possible ? 
I wanna listen to some old music . Not oldies . Acid Bath . Infant Slug . Morbid Angel . I wish my computer could handle dl's like that & my dad's screaming , so , it must be my turn to handle mom . 
is gonna play the piano while mom & dad are at the doctor !!! yay ! i never get to do it bc my mom gets mad at me . 
he just pulled my fingernail off & it's bleeding every where . one finger typing . my mom's on the pouchon & my dad's not here ... grrreat !

Maybe for Halloween I'll just be the Masked Woman or Mistress E ~ , as < PROPMALE > keeps suggesting ... 
< PROPFIRST > M . Petit's Evercast IS ONLINE ! http://bit.ly/3j21cg 
is sleepy . 
is alive !!! 
is PO'ed that my computer has a Virus & I've tried everything , but it keeps attacking . I've slowed it down . I just on't know what else to do . The times I do get online are brief . 
My computer's still on the < PROPMALE > . I have about a minute to a half hour before this baby shuts down . I'm tired of trying to fix this thing . Don't open anything from me if it has a link . I won't be sending those . I only send msges . to a couple people ; & , I'm pretty sure you know who you are A & K , sometimes ... So , i think we're good . 
Gonna paint . Take care FB friends . 
Cowbells at 4am are stupid , but my mom's going insane . She sees bugs , spiders & anything else she can imagine . Then , she tries to burn them . This is so .... * thinking of an adjective * .... sad & crazy . 
is thinking why why why was that fun . 
Liar . I just hit click click click . I already got Mirandum or however the hell she spells the law that's her name .. 
COME SEE squint TONIGHT IN HOUMA AT THE BRICKHOUSE IN HOUMA >>> PLEASE !!! <<< They are a great band . So is No Room For Saints . 
squint was awesomely awesome awesomeness awe of the most awesome * picture either n.p.h. or < PROPFIRST > black * much funnier that way . 
Come on . Go Saints !!! 
would like to take away all of my friend's pain away & hold it inside for them until it goes away . Now , I'm sad . 
Things just went from bad to worse . Threw coffee & milk on my dad . Nursing home or psych ward ... don't know , but he almost picked up the phone to call my sister . So , to my plenty o ' sibling's and/or the wives , if you're even seeing this , be prepared . He might wait until Thanksgiving to see how it goes after that . God , please help my mom & dad . Amen . 
Why am I up ? Oh yeah . My mom woke up at 2:45 am & then , < PROPMALE>'s dad called at 5am . < PROPMALE > is sick & so is < PROPFIRST > . So , we'll all be here . My tummy doesn't feel to well , either . Can I stay home ? Oh wait . I am home ... 
is remembering to thank her brother , Lony , for which I pained at a young age , when he went to Desert Storm & I will never forget what he may have sacrificed & what he did for this Nation . I <3 you . 
because I'm convinced that giving in is the worst thing there is , so we bottled and shelved all our regrets , let them ferment and came back to our senses , drove back home and slept a few days , woke up and laughed at how stupid we used to be .... 
1 ) Scroll to the bottom of your Facebook < PROPFEMALE > . 2 ) On the bottom left corner , click English : US . 3 ) When the language selection appears , click English : ( Pirate ) . 4 ) watch what happens . 
my nap took way too long ... 
Dog's going nuts . Daddy must be home ... 
Up at 5 again , but not by the cow < PROPFEMALE > or my mom banging her trash can on her table or screaming bc I couldn't hear it . I made sure I knocked my butt out last night . I didn't wake up once , well technically I woke up this morning for which I am Thankful for ... 
I'm going away . Usually , FB makes me happy . Right now , I can't stop tearing up . 
I can’t say I blame you but I wish that I could . I’m sick of writing every song about you ... 
My sissy is here . Bad things . 
Mom's going to get help in a Hammond facility . I don't think I'll get in trouble for that . I hope not ... 
We made up , I think . So many things going on in my head ... 
Mom's not here anymore & I woke up crying even with a good nite's sleep . I hope they ( in Hammond ) can help her . 
It's new nice day ... but when I walked into the room where my mom sleeps she wasn't there . They said she'd be back in a week or so . 
i know when & where i'm not wanted . so , i'm this close to saying ,......... \bye bye \"." 
go saints , yay ... 
now i have a migraine ... 
needs help finding a geriatric psychiatrist for my mom ... bc Humana is gonna let her out of the Hammond place before she's ready & we need to have her a doctor in place .... 
thinks FB is eating her updates . Thank God for my dad , but I wish my he would quit leaving without telling me ... 
my head feel like it's gonna explode ... i don't have any of my meds b/c my dr is not responding to the one i need , for some reason , not getting back to me ... when I called they had the wrong number for my house ... that reminds me , I better check on Tweety & BooBoo .... how do you check on canaries ; aside from water & food ? BooBoo seems pissed . that hamburger on my ad < PROPFEMALE > is making me hungry .. maybe I should eat sometimes . 
i'm gonna sign off & actually try to find food this time . 
Rice pudding . Didn't really hit the spot , but a couple bites & a couple Exedrine Migraines & I feel a little better . The turkey's for later ... except for the constant thoughts of , well ... we don't really need to go there again . She'll be back soon & the laundry still hasn't done itself . 
is worried that my cat might actually outlive me . 
mmmm turkey . 
is thinking that these automated apps are driving me nutty ... 
just noticed a really bad smell in this playroom & it's not me . 
is awake & up to no good !!! Morning , Starshine . The world says , \Hello !!! \"!!" 
just found the karaoke choice on I Write Sins Not Tragedies !!! < PROPMALE > thinks I wanna play ball & is going nutso again !!!! They probably have alot of karaoke choices , but I don't wanna make my dog crap on the floor . 
My dog gets way too excited everytime I start to play the piano or sing . 
my eyes hurt from looking at some old(not in age ) friend's picture's for about 4 hours straight . wowsers . i see spots & stuff . where's my < PROPFEMALE > at ... he's supposed to be home with my son by now ...?!?!?! better not make me call his arse ... nal . 
thinks lots of people annoy me , especially phone people at this particular moment . 
Another win for the Home Team !!! Go Tigers !!!! HHS ! I wanna be a cheerleader again . 
Go Saints !! Get busy ... Don't pull a < PROPMALE > Myles(sp ? ) .... stupid stupid stupid . This coming from a girl that hated football when she was a cheerleader . LOL . Although , I would rather be at the movies watching vampires , I am babysitting for my sister & my son is here , too . Waiting on my sweetie to get home & my dad to go visit my mom . Now , to the big screen ...

Bad < PROPMALE > !!! Yeah . We were the one's in the upper corner , talking a bit & laughing . A bunch of adults(well , our age , at least ) giggling & making jokes in a movie theatre . We didn't know the people ; but , we sure felt like we did . That was the fun part . 
well , fb has done it again . what's up with changaroo thing ? some people like things to stay the same ... when it's working for them . big dummies . 
We're going to Lafayette for Thanksgiving !!! 
glad I'm not a crazy shopper this year ... although everyone else in family probably is going shopping . The lack of funding , at the moment , puts a damper on shopping . The lack of a ride keeps me from even window shopping . Oh well . I don't mind last minute things . That's when the bonus comes anyway . :) 
is ready to rest a little bit more before mother totally wakes up . Hopefully , this time it's really awake & not halfway . thanks for the sun , the air , the knowledge , food , people , family , love , friendships & angels in my life . all my thanks rolled into one . tried to do it yesterday from Lafayette , but FB went totally blank over there for some reason . Weird . So be it . Blessed be . <3 
Saturday & no < PROPMALE > again . Poop . 
And , why am I awake so early ?... 
i can't believe < PROPFIRST>'s principal died . i'm sad . i hope her family is okay . 
welcoming a new baby in the world is so special . i wish I could've been there . Congrats , < PROPFEMALE > !!! 
Oh yeah . Go SAINTS !!! 
I love my family . :) I had an awesome Christmas ! 
I think it was the officials fault , partly . Just partly . They could've played the whole game instead of just one quarter . Oh well . I still <3 them . :) 
My brAIN HURTS . We need a new kicker or he needs practice . 
Oh happy day ! 
I'm gonna go with - What's NOT on my mind ? 
How many people got Happy birthday from me for New Year's & that's not your birthday ? If you did , it's bc of the birthday calander app ., not that I don't know some people's off-hand ... it's just that if you didn't input the info , it's default is naturally what it's on already . Sorry . Whatever . :) <3 Going away now . 
it's actually freezing outside . 
yep . still near freezing . gonna freeze this week . i can tell bc my dad has the heater on hi-blast & i think my nose hairs are gonna dry up & fall out . gross . didn't sleep well . i don't like the heater . :/ 
... 
I think I get it . Grey . 
nude 
I found out that St < PROPFIRST > Parish Schools had a power outage this morning for a few hours , but they kept school running bc they had heat all night & it came back on at about 8:30 am . Our schools are pretty great . I'm glad I washed < PROPFIRST>'s Jacket & had his clothes in the dryer before he put them on so they'd be warm . He was warm & didn't want to ride the bus . So , Poppa took him to school . 
* sighs 
wants to relax after all this 12 year old boy party stuff . blah . man , i love that kid . he thinks he's gonna camp out with his friends in the backyard . heh . he'll be the first one in MY bed trying to get warm . 
no more boy sleep-overs in this house . that's a good thing . 
Baby blue 
isn't feeling well .

Great minds tend to have fatal flaws ... not always . 
can't sleep . dunno why . i should be able to . 
I finally got a good night's sleep , but I feel like I could sleep more . And , why are my left pinky and ring finger numb since yesterday . It's not Carpal Tunnel , had that . Wrong fingers . :( 
I have a ton of pics to upload , but a meeting at school to go to . The pics have to wait . < PROPFIRST>'s in Honor Choir !! 
There are about 100 pics I need to upload . I just don't feel like it . I believe my Ulnar nerve problem is getting worse . When I went to bed last night my whole left side of my hand was numb , not a good numb either . It's still that way , just a little pain meds to take the egde off . I might have to go to a dr before my scheduled appointment in March . I had to take my rings off of my hand . I never take my rings off !!! 
With_Gusto's back on lj !!!! Woot ! 
Quidquid latine dictum sit , altum sonatur . ( Whatever is said in Latin sounds profound . ) I always wanted to be somebody , but now I realize I should have been more specific . — < PROPFEMALE > Tomlin 
Go Saints ! All The Way !!! 
So , it is officially official . Most of my friends are crazy Saints fans . Most could not sleep at all , if not waking up at 4-5am this morning to post their crazy who dat nation raps & songs . i love it !!! PANTS ON THE GROUND .... ( ok , someone else finish ... ) 
Poeple are popping fireworks outside !!! It's a new holiday ! WHO DAT DAY !!!! 
MIDDLE NAME ONLY . Everyone play this game . You will find it interesting to know what your FB friend's middle name is . Copy and paste this on your profile before you put your middle name at end of this sentence !... Celeste . 
one hand typing is annoying . it's like me not playing the piano . it's like me thinking that i may not have a viable left hand anymore to play anything with . it stinks . and , all he can think is that i'm happy about being hurt . \another useless day for Ellen ! \ " he screams at me . x-rays set for monday . < PROPMALE > thinks i broke my wrist & rehealed it unproperly . not unlikely . this hurts . multiple ways . "

Happy Get Your Madness On Day . I've already began the punishment of Lent , even though I don't even go to church anymore . I have some pics from the Lul Parade which is a really hard one for me to miss since I live in the middle of it . I'm actually surprised that no one asked to park here . Anyway , my calfs still hurt from walking around so much even though I was liberally messed up .

thinks her dad stood her up . it's a really sucky feeling . I know the concert started at 7pm bc I found the flyer . He left an hour early ... :( 
he did & he's sorry . Why can't I close the book ? 
geuss who's not napping ??? 
need to walk to the store . i'm trying to wait for < PROPMALE > . remind me to get visine next time i've cried all night and then met someone in the morning . helping me to get a job , at that . geez . i know i looked good . just can't catch a break . i'm gonna get a job if it kills me . test me . i wish my eyes were red & teary bc i was high . i hate crying constantly . i know i'm depressed . i'm gonna push through this bc i have to . 
why is everyone throwing food at me ? 
i don't know that i'll be able to look at my dad's rice & gravy again without puking . i think i'm gonna eat yogurt right now . 
i don't like when the heater burns my nose hairs . 
mmmm . gummy bears . 
i'll get back to you on that . 
is wondering what happened to Mr. Zanca . <3 
the whole wide world . 
juat saw < PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland(revisited ) . It's 3D . I have a migraine . Otherwise , it was pretty okay . 
just took < PROPFIRST > outside to throw ball with him ( baseball ) . He kind of forgot how hard I throw & I really should not have been catching . He doesn't throw that hard anyway . That's good or I'd be in even more pain . 
wants to go to the < PROPFEMALE>'s day parade . < PROPMALE>'s being a big poopy . 
went to the Quarter earlier . I <3 < PROPFEMALE > . 
went to the Quarter yesterday with < PROPMALE > . Then , got a headache & went home to go to sleep without any noise or light . Ahhh . Relief . I still <3 < PROPFEMALE > . 
since i'm already in pain , i wish i could be of use and take away pain from people that suffer much more than i do . someone pretty close to me has cancer & it's impacting me more than i thought it would , i guess . she was always the one smiling , joking & laughing . no one knows what will happen next . it's spread to the brain . 
Todays game - PLACE OF BIRTH ! Everyone please play ! You will find it interesting to know where your FB friends birth places are . Copy & paste this on your profile , then put your place of birth at the end of this sentence . New Orleans , LA . 
Happy St. < PROPFIRST>'s Day , all !! 
My new neurologist just cancelled bc she's going on sick leave until June ... wth ? I'm gonna end up going to the hospital to get this EMG done . It was ordered on Feb . 1 . Stupid . 
is sick . So , is mom . Puking bile is so nasty . I also feel like a truck crushed me . 
still feel icky , but not as bad . i'll live . yay . 
just realized that most mascaras irritate my eyes so much they cause my eyes to water & look red/puffy , and i have a small stye on my eyelid that's aggravating it right now . Very uncool & a little uncomfortable . It'd hard to see partially .

If anyone wants something look at my previous post . Moving on . < PROPFEMALE > you might 5 glorious gifts , as it stands . :) I'm proud of my son for bringing up his grades . They're not all A's , but it's way better than before .

it's kinda cold & smells like a toilet in here ... & it's not me or my mom's portable pochon(toilet ) . 
status shuffle 
that's what you get when you let your heart win ... whoa .. oh .. ah .. oh .. oh .

oooo .... Cambridge who's who called me about a week ago and i acted like i wasn't here . i always do that when i'm not sure who's on the other end . now , i see why they called me . 
the doc says i'll need another hand surgery and tried to give me something like synthetic morphine for pain . i didn't take that Rx . i got a different , less potent one bc < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > said , \Just Say No ! \ " \ " call me the philosopher ... \"" 
nervousness . 
putting this here : someone gave my mom Tang wth Red Hots in it when I was little . all I remember was trying to dig the red hots out before my mom threw out the Tang . lol . and on Space and NASA . I LOVE THIS STUFF . anyone who knows me knows that but i don't know about you . i was a little stressed in the 4th grade when we actually took time out of our day to watch the Challenger ... blow up . 
i'm thinking \how did this bruise get on my bad hand that i try not to use ? \ " & \ " boiling water does not feel good on that same hand ... \ " & jumping back in bed until April's over springs to mind . If only it weren't < PROPMALE>'s birthday tomorrow . any ideas ? anyone ? i have zero money . " 
can't believe the nerve of some people . 
is excited about auditions for kiki today . i hope < PROPMALE > doesn't work too late . 
is thinking about too much to put here . 
Don't pray it was easier , pray you were better . Don't pray for less problems , pray to be more skilled . Don't pray for less challenges , pray for more wisdom . ( stolen from < PROPMALE > ) 
i'll go along with this one : †† lets keep the families of the men & the men that were on the transocean rig that exploded last night in our prayers ... the rig was located 52 < PROPMALE > off of the Louisiana coast ... there are still 11 crew members missing ... KEEP THE PRAYER CHAIN GOING ? repost as your status †† , if you feel it . :) 
made ribs for dinner ... 
is happy today . fierce , yet happy . 
if they was any doubt of my dog being part hound , i have none now . when the car alarms go off , it's like she's calling for her doggy mommy . it's so cute . it's not just a howl , either , it's a variety of vocalities only a dog could make . and , maybe that guy that does sound effects . 
making meatloaf . it looks more blobish than loafish . meatblob . mac-n-cheese , too . there will be a veggie . still working on that . probably salad tonight . alot of < PROPFEMALE > in the fridge . and that is your \What's for dinner ? \ " update . no pics unless the blob is really histerical or something . :) " 
it's pouring down raining outside . be safe , peeps . 
dear zoo world friends , regretfully , i am not able to continue my own zoo . so feel free to do whatever with it and don't be offended if i don't accept your gifts and whatnots . thanks , < PROPFEMALE > .

anyone wanting info on < PROPFEMALE>'s services , fb me . i'll be gone awhile , tho . 
sesquipedalianism : given to using long words . 
A cool friend's challenge - Let's see how many of you actually pay attention to these status updates . Leave a one-word comment that you think best describes me using the third letter of your name . It can only be one word . No more than one word . Then copy and paste this on your wall so I can leave a word about you .

is taking a facebook vacation . 
is worried about impending disaster and diabolical plans of de-evolution . i actually thought life got easier when you grew up . boy , was i wrong . i think my son has this figured out already bc he acts as if there's no tomorrow . he is so carefree and happy . it's how i used to be . so , i've been thinking about how much i love my son and i don't think that i can ever be more in love with anyone else . 
i feel better except i see an 80's picture of me down there ... COOPER !!! i will slay you !!! omg . 
my dog ran outside the front door bc she didn't want to poo in the back ... she's a mess . good thing < PROPMALE>'s here to pick up the crap . hysterical . 
i'm hungry . i should probably eat something today . 
i couldn't type this little update without her calling for me 5 times . not an overstatement , either . she smoked 3 cigarettes in 5 minutes . 
i might cut the grass if it dries up enough . anything to get me out of the house for a little while . nucking futs . 
ggrrr . laundry . 
<3 ' ing my son , but he needs a serious kick in the rear . 
my neighbor died in his sleep last night . he wasn't old enough to die . i'm in shock . i really don't believe it . i have his cell number in my phone . he had big plans . i hope you are at peace , < PROPFIRST > . we love you and your family . i keep thinking i'm gonna see him when i get the mail . :( 
i'm still shocked . :/ 
anyone getting those daily < PROPFEMALE > deal coupons ? the < PROPFEMALE > branch is a good place to eat . healthy stuff . i love their chicken curry salad . 
< PROPMALE > of persia was really good . 
seems like everyone is dying around me . another death in the family over the weekend . hope all is well with you your's . <3

is making apple cobbler today for the first time . smells good so far . 
i am floored by the things that go on around me . 
For some people on Facebook , I need a SLAP button instead of the POKE button ... 
The next time someone annoys you so much you just wanna slap em .. do it and say , \Mosquito\ " and quickly walk away ;D " 
Give someone a compliment today . It'll make them and you feel good . =) 
<3 <3 <3 i washed my hair now it's raining ! 
tubing today ! 
went to the ER yesterday for dyhrdation and 2nd degree burns . i brought sunscreen but < PROPMALE > didn't want to < PROPFEMALE > it and i asked him to before we when tubing . my cell phone got lost , too . so i have to shut it off when i can sit long enough to call them . :( < PROPMALE>'s got some blisters , too . so stupid . :( the tubing part was fun . the sun wasn't . not to the degree that my shins can handle , apparently . 
A clean-energy future 
i know it looks bad , and it hurts bad but it's not as bad as it could be .

is wondering why the birds chirp at night , the owl whos in the morning and the rooster down the road cockadoodle do's at 5pm ... are they all time confused ? 
I got nothin . 
what do dreams mean ? anything ? nothing ? my dreams usually tell a story . my last dreams are confusing me .

palm pre plus froze up on me and the hold time was insane so i have to call back about sending it in for a new one . i hope i can get a different one . stupid fun phone for a week . 
Let's see who is paying attention . Every single one of you are on my\ 
friends ' list , as a result of a conscious decision . I wanted you \ 
there . I am not only glad to count you as friends , but also as \ 
family . Let's see who on my friends ' list actually pays attention . Copy and paste this or just share something .

it's hot in here ... 
this is not a good night for me to be unable to sleep . I have thing's to do tomorrow that don't involve looking like I need sleep ! 
I got a whole 4 hours of sleep ! Woohoo ! 
Open forum : how should i cut my hair ? and ... what kind of hi-lite's should i get ? 
still mixed feeling about my hair appointment tomorrow . don't know what i want . :/ 
i guess it's ok ... just kidding . I love it <3 
I cut my hair ! 
I did it ! 
Episode Eureka 
I love true friends . What's on your mind ? 
< PROPFIRST>'s first football scrimage is today is at 5:30 . So , why is all his gear here ... and I need to get dressed . I love him so much I could squeeze all that icky boy goo out of him . <3 
today was ok . my mom's been telling me she loves me after every bath . it's a tear jerker . 
i know one thing that's going to make me furious by the end of the week and another thing that's already eating away at my anger buttons . where's a good punching bag when i need it ? 
who dat ! 
i know i sent my painting/drawing from my phone to here last night ... 
Going to the gym for the first time since .... uhhhh . 
I've been having the worst dreams again . 
Sometimes I need to remind myself of what < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > once said , \No one can take advantage of you without your permission . \"" 
THANKS YOU ALL FOR THE BIRTHDAY WISHES . <3 <3 <3 
I'm tired . Are we there yet ? 
Why am I still waking up every few hours ? Whaaa . 
Chicken . 
( FBOOK ) 
ucluttering my rooms will take more than three days . * yawn * 
I want sleep ! :/ 
Sorry everyone . I'm not superstitious but this October has 5 fridays 5 saturdays and 5 sundays . this happens once every 823 years . This is known as money bags . So copy this to your staus and money will arrive within 4 days , based on Chinese Feng Shui . The one who does not copy will be without money . I cannot let that person be me . Copy within 11 min ... hope it works ! 
must finish the pumpkins . I have ideas , but what are some other ideas can you all think of to decorate one . 
candypants ? 
go saints ... <3 
Happy Veteran's Day !!! 
Baby names ! Suggest girl or nonspecific gender names please . Really want help with this . I'm not having a baby , btw . 
Where in the world is < PROPFIRST > Sandiego ? What made her so special . Oh and gooo saints !!! 
my internal radio keeps changing stations . It's annoying . I want to sleep . 
I made this . 
she walks in beauty like night on cloudles climes ... ( well , she did . ) 
There's a trapdoor in your heart ... \ 
There's a false bottom line and it's falling apart ... lalala 
red full lunar eclipse < PROPFEMALE > tonight @ 1 : 40 for three hours . Hope I'm awake . 
Happy Christmas and all the other amalgamations of Christmas . 
I'm probably going to start fresh with a new facebook < PROPFEMALE > , so in a few days those who really notice and care send a request to me . I'll be sending some myself . Peace . 
I love my family very much . 
I miss my son alot . I'm throwing his birthday party next weekend . Any friends of his that don't get an invite check with < PROPFIRST > . I had to set a limit . It's basketball themed . btw . 
anyone wanting to attend < PROPFIRST>'s 13th birthday bash , send me a msg via Fb and I'll give you the info . It's this Saturday . 
Wow . Sad part is I really consider her a friend . Angry at my fiance and/or his dad has nothing to do with me , in fact , if I ever heard them talk bad about this person . I would take her side . Girls in their 20's really act this way ? So fickle . Just what we were talking about last week . I need some < PROPFIRST > A ., but she's probably sleeping . 
do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around , that's what it's all about . 
you go green bay . <3 
Today was pretty great . My new green shoes and my owl jewelry came in . Plus , finding friends you thought you'd never find again is beyond amazing . So awesome . <3
