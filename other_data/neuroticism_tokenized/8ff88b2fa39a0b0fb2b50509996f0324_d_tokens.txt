I think I'm just gonna crash to Moulin Rouge again . This has been a good night though , I love my best < PROPMALE > . :] :D 

God ... fuck . 
My my what a mess we've made of our precious little lives these days , it appears a big fucking tornado has twisted us up recently . 
Hating that point where regardless of if I am in a room full of people , or just with a couple of my closest friends , I still feel a little sad , a little lonely , that I have no one to hold my hand . 
Sometimes I think I'm bigger than the sound . 
I'm tired . I love swimming so much >.< . Almost as much as my buds . 
Shaking , like a dog shitting razorblades , waking up alone after dreaming of you and me . I'm waking up all alone , waking up so relieved . 
And baby I can see you've been fucked with too\ 
\ 
But that don't mean your loving days are through\ 
' Cause people will say all kinds of things \ 
But that don't mean a damn to me\ 
' Cause all I see is what's in front of me\ 
And that's you 
Prom went as expected , but I still had fun . After prom was still better . 
Fuck . Weekend's already almost over . Went way too fast . Two weeks and school is over ... Everythings going too fast >.< 
I'm gonna go read some god damn X-Men comics ... I'm so excited >.< 
I gotta go to the coast soon , which would be pretty awesome if it was with my friends ... With my parents ? Not so much . 
Is really tired of this lonely thing . D'x 
Uhhhhhh .... tomorrow ... and then another year is gone . It went so freakin fast ! o_o 
I'm glad I went to graduation , got to see all of the seniors I love before they go on to be adults . Who knows if I'll ever see some of those kids again ... 
Sooo tired . Rode my bike all over the park . 
Wow . Long day . I had fun . Too bad I missed < PROPFEMALE>'s party , but I had a nice time despite it . :D 
Gosha ... I'm tired . 
Damn you < PROPMALE > of the Hill ! I don't wanna have to relate to < PROPFIRST > about my loneliness problems Dx 
That moment at the end where we look deep into each other's eyes , and I see what you're thinking in yours and you feel what I'm screaming in mine . And you kiss my hand to be a dork , and you kiss my cheek to be sweet , and you kiss me on the lips to be honest , and you kiss me goodbye cause it's late . 
Phew ... I gotta stop doing this whole , walk around town all day and then stay up all night thing . I'm so exhausted xD 
Well ... Fuck . I have to admit , I am kinda pissed , and wouldn't mind punching this dude in the face ... >.< Fuuuuuuccckkkkkk .... 
Back to an old comfort . J-pop . I miss listening to anime openings and endings . 
Can anyone give me < PROPFIRST > McElroy's or < PROPFEMALE > Hoots ' cell phone < PROPFIRST > ? 
I'm ... gonna have a long two weeks ahead of me ... 
Hmm ... Well ... The 10 hour car ride with my grandpa is going to be absolutely horrible , but I'll be glad to see my grandma . I'm gonna be so bored though xD 
I feel pretty gross . The sky was hazy and purple last night . No stars . But it was still bright because of the light pollution or whatever . I wanna take a shower >.< 
I think I must be fucking crazy . Just like the rest of my family . Fuck I hate genetics . 
In about two hours I will hopefully be on a bus home . 
I wish I had the opening song from Superjail on my ipod so I could have played as I was entering < PROPMALE > . It woulda been perfect xD 
Hold your own , know your name , and go your own way . Everything will be fine . 
Gosha . >.< Oh . Someone's online :O xP 
Fuga . 
I've got , a big fat fucking bone to pick , with you my darling . In case you haven't heard , I'm sick and tired of trying . 
People will say all kinds of things that don't mean a damn to me , cause all I see is what's in front of me , and that's you . 
Fuck , I wanna rip Umbridge out of this bloody book/movie and beat her fucking face in . The actress does that horrid fake nice far too well . It's like super-Ayabe 
Gosha , barely anyone talks to me on here . I should have birthdays more often xD . Thank you to everyone that wished me happy birthday :p 
This movie is kinda stupid lol . < PROPFIRST > decided that the people are possessed by the baseball field . < PROPFIRST > says it's an infection . But , I got a laptop ! So , that's pretty fuckin ' sweet . :DDD 
This sleeping thing is a problem xD 
Alright , I ... am going to try to force myself to sleep tonight . Course , that never works , but I'mma try anyway . 
I'm in the mood ... for Sublime . Yeah . Well , more so than the usual . 
I never loved nobody fully , always one foot on the ground , and by protecting my heart truly , I got lost in the sounds . I hear in my mind , all these voices . I hear in my mind , all these words . I hear in my mind , all of this music , and it breaks my heart ... 
Should probably stop tearing apart the insides of my lip ... 
Who\ 
knows me best ?? Comment my full name , age , birthday , eye color , \ 
favorite thing to do , favorite color , and one of my bestfriends . Copy to\ 
your status and see who knows you best . (: 
Really tired and can't sleep . Kinda anxious . >.< \ 
I hope I look good today * crosses fingers * 
Wherever you go there'll be love love love :D 
:D I'm home ! Well , not right now , but I'm in < PROPMALE > . Hanging out with < PROPFEMALE > . 
Ohhh fuck . School's in two weeks . 
:/ ... 
Love is a dangerous pastime , caught between madness and gladness of flight . Nothing is wrong and nothing is right , falling asleep in your arms every night . I want to sing , to you my love . 
I must go on standing , you can't break that which isn't yours . I must go on standing . I'm not my own , it's not my choice . 
She needs to darn her socks 
Totally blew < PROPFIRST>'s mind last night . I love the way that movie combines deep philosophical questions with insane graphic brutality and constant confusing directions . 
Fuck , I keep getting told that people are commenting on < PROPMALE>'s and < PROPFEMALE>'s statuses , but I can't see them . 
I felt you in my life before I ever thought to . I feel the need to lay down beside you and tell you , I feel you in my heart . 
Last night sucked ! I laid in bed for 12 hours trying to beat this insomnia thing , and I didn't get anywhere . Dx 
I could save you baby , but it isn't worth my time . Cause even if I saved you , there's a million more in line . 
:/ Blaaahhh . 
Something interesting about the show < PROPMALE > . It's fucking amazing , yet it seems to be held together completely by the main character . The supporting cast are like ... all horrifically annoying xD 
Totally just did a photo shoot with myself . 
I loved you first , beneath the stars that came falling on our heads . But they're just old light . They're just old light . 
I'm only really lookin ' forward to two things ... School , and seeing him again . Not in that order . 
I'm so freakin ' screwed when school starts . I just can't sleeppppp DDDx 
Ittai ... Watashi no kokoro ga ittai . >.< 
Has the same shoe size and waist size as my 13 year old brother ... 
* crosses my fingers * please let me sleep tonight . 
I've got a perfect body , but sometimes I forget . I've got a perfect body , cause my eyelashes catch my sweat . Yes they do . 
Just found out that there is a Deltora Quest anime ....!!! :DDDD 
* dances * I get to see my boy friend , I get to see my boyyy friend . \ 
>.< xDDDDDDD 
Time to start researching for the first studies project . * sigh * Goooo New York . 
Pens and penknives take the blame , crane my neck and scratch my name , but the ugly marks are worth the momentary gain . When I jab a sharpened object in , choirs of angels seem to sing hymns of hate in memorandum ! 
Holy shit , Facebook sucks . People can't even be nice without someone else freaking out , and when I try and defend the person being nice , suddenly I'm childish . 
Leave a one word comment that you think best describes me using the THIRD letter of YOUR name . It can only be one word . No more than one word . Then copy and paste this post on your wall so I can leave a word about you . 
I am not happy :/\ 
Making me feel even worse , I just had to fight off a fucking virus . >:[ 
:/ I feel sick ... I need a hug . 
Another all nighter . At least I finished that script >.> \ 
I feel like I need more research for Studies though . Uuuggghhh . Fuck school man . 
* sigh * I hate being curious . 
I wish I wasn't such a bloody introvert Dx 
I will be COMPLETELY HONEST FOR 24 HOURS .... You can ask me 1 question ( only in my INBOX ) . \ 
Any question , no matter how crazy or weird it is . There is no ulterior\ 
motive . You have my FULL honesty , but I DARE to put this as your status\ 
to see what questions you get .. let's see what happens ... :) 
I'm in that mood to listen to my music that very few Americans will give a chance . \ 
I'd blame it on the rain ... but I'm in this mood all the time xD\ 
<3 Rakuen by Do As Infinity 
* sigh * I hate how stressed schoolwork makes me . \ 
Especially because it acts more like an obstacle than a motivation 
This show makes me feel more awkward about it with every new episode . She just creamed while slashing zombies , and the guy accepted her for it for his survival ...? Fuckin ' weird ass anime xD 
Today fucking sucked . 
I'm finally deleting my myspace account . 
We keep on burying our dead\ 
We keep on planting their bones in the ground\ 
But they won't grow\ 
The sun doesn't help\ 
And all we've got\ 
Is a giant crop\ 
Of names\ 
And dates 
Lol my neck hurt really really bad , and then I read a < PROPMALE > Potter book and it stopped . It must be a miracle !!! xD I'mma guess this kind of occurence is how all that faith healer shit started . 
Blah . :/ 
\NOT MY DAUGHTER 
I had ... a strange dream . It was fun . There was chocolate syrup in the cupboard , which made me sad when I woke up because of our lack of . And I was best friends with this girl I've never met . 
xD I have nooo fucking clue what she meant by this in our speech , \We have a large abundance of everything . \"" 
* sigh * Yesterday was great . Today was pretty nice , till he had to leave . \ 
I was not happy with that >.< 
So ... I finally know now . I know ... why I hate them . Why I'm so fucked up .... \ 
And now I really wish I knew why I can't cry . 
He stumbled into faith and thought , \God 
That was ... a freakin ' amazing nap ... \ 
* hugs my pillow * 
IGSEJFSDfiojakljf . I'm now hurting someone I care about with my fucking ... FUCK . And all I want is to shake and to cry and to feel what I KNOW I'm feeling but ... all that happens is a little wetness comes to the eye . Not even enough to spill into a single tear ... 
... not pleased . 
\Who's this guy ? \ " \ " That's Opie\ " \ " Opie . \ " \ " Opie is our master . \ " \ 
I think the only thing that could ever make me cheat is < PROPMALE > Nowell's voice . Something about it just makes me wanna .... xD 
\One day I'm gonna loose the war . \ " \ 
Practicing ... I'm probably gonna lose my voice before I even get to the concert xD 
You gotta be genuine , thats the name of this game . If you're real , you got nothin ' to worry about . But if you're synthetic the more your balls come off . 
Fuck my life . Tides of impulses and emotions are crashing on me , and I swear that smile is a trap . 
Phew ... I'm glad that's over and done with . I hope I did my little bit well enough to avoid hindering how good the concert was . \ 
And I still swear that smile is a trap . 
I know the shape of your hands , because I watch them when you talk , and I know the shape of your body cause I watch it when you walk . 
:/ .............. \ 
I hope that smile isn't a trap . 
( 530)262-7042\ 
I'm bored , talk to me . :D 
I suppose my love is like a dark cloud full of rain that's always right there up above you ... At least it makes sense in my head . 
Hm ... if I were to start posting writings done on a whim , would anyone read them ? 
That smile of yours shined so brightly , I found myself near blind . I knew it was a dream automatically , you never treated me so sweetly . Nothing in your expression made me feel annoying , and for once I didn't feel like you hated me . A smile exploded across my face , because honestly , this dream is all that I've asked for for the past week . Honestly . 
How do I even begin to explain what I'm feeling right now ? :/ 
Have you ever tried to force yourself to stop feeling a certain way ? 
:o ohhh noooo ... I just so happened to continue sleeping .... and then not go to school ... \ 
:o xD 
What a cunt . 
Is there anywhere in < PROPMALE > that's hiring ? And willing to hire someone that is under 18 ? 
Oh from the wicked , < PROPFEMALE > us away . Captivity , required from us a song . But how can we sing < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE>'s song in a strange land ? \ 
{ I <3 BradleyNowellxD } 
A positive self-image ? What the fuck is that !? xD 
Maybe I'll catch fire , something warm to hold me , something pure to burn away the darkness that hides inside my mind . All that evil shit's not hard to find , I guess I only claim to be nice . 
This is what I mean , Cisco ! You attract trouble like a fiddler attracts a square dance ! 
I was gonna call you a < PROPMALE > , but then you logged off . Awww . :[ \ 
xP xD 
Fuuuuck . Waited all weekend to finish an essay that took me 40 minutes . Which is even more ridiculous , because it took me 40 minutes to write two paragraphs xD 
:DDD Dude ! :DDDDD 
You've been planning to remember\ 
So nothing will be lost in the end\ 
And you burn burn burn your life down 
I've got it now , a big thorn in my side the size of a cadillac . 
Fuck yeah , math homework is out of the way . Maybe I'll feel a bit more free this weekend . 
>.< Meh . 
I'm nerrrrrvoooouussss Dx 
I wish I was cuter and less ... weird xP\ 
Definitely too weird , I probably scare everyone off lol . 
I don't even know what to think right now ... 
What is up with all of these fucking event invitations about someone brutally beating and killing someone else , or a group of teenagers , or whatever . I've gotten three today , and two yesterday . 
My hopes are so high , that your kiss might kill . So won't you kill me ? So I'll die happy . 
Kefka is such a freak . I'm so glad I'm playing through IV right now and not VI . \ 
Rydia ftw . 
Fuck I'm sooo sore Dx\ 
But it was a good day . Much more exercise than I usually get , but that's a good thing . \ 
If I wasn't so tired , I'd say I was in the mood to wrestle . 
Alright , your time is up . Intestines , you're coming out . 
* sigh * the radio sucks . It needs like ... some < PROPFEMALE > Spektor , Alkaline Trio , some old acoustic Sublime ... hm ... Well , I'd continue , but I'd just be listing my favorite bands xD 
... * sigh * This perpetual feeling that I have to find someone gets really fucking tiresome after a few years . Is there no way to tell my loneliness to fuck off for a while ? 
My comment responses are too long Dx\ 
It's one of those days where I feel like I need to say everything that I have to say . \ 
These days are rare , considering usually I just stfu . \ 
Which I feel like I need to do now cause I'm rambling . \ 
Fuck . xP 
Starting the last volume of AKIRA . \ 
I'm excited >.< 
Ughhh I'm soooo booored . 
I shouldn't be able to get headaches from bullshit on facebook . \ 
-_- \ " , 2010-11-06 19:44:56 " 
And you could have it all , my empire of dirt . I will let you down , I will make you hurt . 
How happy my life would be , if only that one man could love me ... 
And then that word grew louder and louder , till it was a battle cry\ 
I'll come back , when you call me . No need to say goodbye . 
Fuck you internal clock . You make sleep so difficult . \ 
All I wanted to do was go to sleep at seven and wake up at three . * sigh * 
Ohhh Final Fantasy IV , you're cheesy ending brings me such joy . 
* sigh * < PROPFEMALE > , I wish what you think you see in that guy was true . \ 
:/ 
The definition of\ 
A crazy person is\ 
Someone that does the same things\ 
Over and over again while expecting new results\ 
I cut off my tongue -- you started to kiss me\ 
Blood trickled down--don't you ever miss me ? 
I cannot even begin to explain how great my envy is ; I would give anything to have planted one of those kisses upon your skin . Never before , have I desired more , to be one of the angels who did . 
Sometimes , I get a little bored of the same old games ... \ 
But then I remember , I have like six different final fantasy's ... so I can stfu . \ 
xD\ 
Go Tactics !!!!! 
Love is the answer to a question that I have forgotten\ 
but I know I've been asked\ 
and the answer's got to be love . 
fml . I guess I'm not going anywhere tonight . \ 
:/ oh well . 
Hey , remember that time when you od'ed ? \ 
Hey , remember that other time when you od'ed for the second time ? \ 
Well in the waiting room while waiting for news of you , \ 
I hallucinated I could read your mind , \ 
and I was on a lot of shit too but what I saw , man , I tell you was freaky ... Freaky ... 
I've met my dream man . The hero from Fable III . <3 
Friends is like the best show ever , at least when it comes to sitcoms . \ 
I can just pick a random season and be comforted for hours . 
There is this thing that's like fucking , except you don't fuck\ 
Back in the day it just went without saying it all\ 
All the world's history gradually dying of shock\ 
There is this thing that's like talking , except you don't talk\ 
You sing , you sing 
That dream was too good , too grand , too butterfly-inducing . It's not fair , even my subconscious supports me continuing in my pathetic way . \ 
He was so nice , he just seemed to wanna be friends ... That's all I really want anymore . 
Not good . \ 
I don't even wanna leave the house tomorrow . 
I want you to notice when I'm not around . 
Damn , I woke up . :/ 
Change your facebook profile picture to a cartoon from your childhood and invite your friends to do the same . Until Monday ( Dec . 6 ) there should be no human faces on facebook , but an invasion of memories . This is for violence against children . 
Why do birds suddenly appear , ever time you are near ? \ 
Just like me , they long to be , close to you . \ 
Why do stars fall down from the sky , every time you walk by ? \ 
Just like me , they long to be close to you . 
This isn't the way it's meant to be . Every day shouldn't feel like a battle . \ 
I should be able to be happy for a moment . I should be able to think about something other than ... Fuuuuuuccckkkk . Dx 
He's utterly sarcastic- aesthetically confused\ 
He tells me I'm bombastic , I want to be his muse\ 
An ordinary person who climbed into his void\ 
Would only wake up bitter and deeply paranoid 
-Send me a personal message with a number , any number , and I'll post a status with that number telling you how I feel about you . 
13 . Hm ... you don't argue very well , but you seem like a nice person . You also seem to have a lot of friends , you're really lucky :D 
333 . You're really short xP You have a cute smile :D \ 
You're also a very nice person , I had fun filling bags of oatmeal with you lol . 
880 We used to be like best friends :o \ 
It kinda sucks that we've lost touch , but I do really < PROPFEMALE > the time we spent as friends . Please keep contact ( email : seraphim199@gmail.com ) . I'll do the same . 
7007 . >.< you're my best friend . I would be completely lost without you right now . I would've at least lost my mind to loneliness . Thank you for being the only one who will talk to me , even on the days where it feels like I've lost my voice . I've got a lot of growing to do , I hope you'll stick it out with me . ^-^ 
143 . Hm ... I'm still really sorry . I wanna be friends , I just hate texting . You're adorable and you need to remember that . I had a dream where you were a vampire once . 
123456789 . You're so full of color . I wish I had tons of clothes . I miss when we were friends freshman year , and I'm sorry for always mooching off of you back then . >.< \ 
I hope you've been happy . :] 
1212 . You're a pretty cool guy . It was nice hanging out the couple times that we did . I think you dress well . :p 
9 I miss youuuu !!! I've thought about texting you recently , actually . You're crazy and fun , I hope college has been going well . :o 
222 You are an awesome team leader . Just to start with . You are so sweet and funny . I enjoyed talking to you in studies . And I think it's awesome that you're in a real relationship in high school xP 
8601 . Dude , I miss you and hanging out with everyone Freshman year . I'm so glad I had you guys , otherwise I would've been completely alone . You are a great mentor-type , and I learned a lot from you . Go on teaching and learning and laughing and having fun . And maybe let me in on a little bit of it from time to time . ^-^ 
Mr. Infinity . I don't really know you , but you like the color aqua , and you're gonna cook food in < PROPFEMALE > someday . If you really are that much more insane than me , I'll be kind of scared . You don't know the extent of my madness xD\ 
But I'd like to be friends with you , cause you're nice and funny and weird . 
Number 4 , you're a total douche . Not really , but you never talk to me anymore :/\ 
I still love you though , you'[ll always be my < PROPMALE > , even when one of us are being jerks . 
Mmmm , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > vs . Zombies . He was the sweetest guy in Love , Actually . Now he's just a total hotty . xP 
The news guy on channel seven is kinda cute xD\ 
At least I think so . He can tell me about car crashes any day . 
One day I'm gonna lose the war ... 
Let's just say this mood isn't exactly good for my health . It will either go one way or another , both of which won't be without pain . 
I've literally spent an hour trying to word my response to a message . I feel retarded or something . >.< :/ 
Heyyy everyone on facebook . Send me pictures of haircuts you think would look good on me . Pretty please . I'll appreciate it ! ^-^ 
You don't know , but that's okay , you might find me anyway . \ 
Don't you know that I belong arm in arm with you , baby ? \ 
In a town that's cold and gray , we will have a < PROPFEMALE > day . \ 
Don't you know that I belong arm in arm with you , baby ? 
He tells me I'm bombastic I want to be his muse\ 
So let me get this straight ... < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is on his 8th divorce , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > is possibly getting married for a 9th time , < PROPFEMALE > Spears had a 55 hour marriage , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > and Tiger Woods , while married , were having sex with EVERYONE ; yet the idea of same-sex marriage is going to destroy the institution of marriage ? Really ?? Re-post to your < PROPFEMALE > if you agree - Proud to support equal rights for ALL !!! 
This house is full of ears , but I can't talk to anyone they've heard this one a thousand times . Most exciting thing I do , < PROPFEMALE > halfway out a third floor window , maybe throw lit cigarettes down . And maybe I'll catch fire , something warm to hold me , something pure to burn away the darkness that hides inside my mind . All that evil shit's not hard to find , I guess I only claim to be nice . 
INBOX ONLY : 2010's almost over ! Inbox me a confession you wanted to tell/ask me ! put this as your status and see what happens :o 
We'll never be friends , and I'll probably never talk to you again . \ 
It almost makes me wanna cry , but whenever I think of you , I'll be slightly cheered up by the thoughts and feelings I've had , that have kept me wishing we could at least chat one more time . 
It's wrong enough that I haven't been able to sleep for the past two days , but within a half hour of when I'm going to get up and shower , I fall asleep . \ 
Two hours later , at 7:10 , just when there's no way to catch my bus , I finally hear my phone vibrate when I missed the alarm I'd set at 5:30 . Fuck my life . 
[ poke ] me if you had a crush on me or still do . \ 
[ like ] this status if im a good friend . \ 
[ message ] me if you ever wanted a relationship . \ 
[ comment ] on this if we had any great memories . \ 
... If you feel brave , copy this & paste it on your wall :o 
Dude , I love the Sims 3 . 
Blaaaahhhh . \ 
This morning would be nicer if I had slept . Maybe my problem is that I give up around 1 o'clock . 
It's hard , it's hard\ 
To live , to live\ 
It's hard , it's harder\ 
Than it's ever been before\ 
Things that used to comfort me\ 
Don't comfort me anymore\ 
But you can't spend your whole life\ 
Waiting for God to kiss you\ 
You can't spend your whole life\ 
Can't spend your whole life\ 
Waiting for God to kiss you back . 
I guess my only question now is ... would it be this difficult if I was born someone else ? \ 
More importantly , is this ... problem , something that I can fix ? Or am I stuck in this rut forever ? Because it's apparent I've made no headway , and I'm certainly not willing to waste away like this for a lifetime . 
But what if there's no one nice to kiss !? And I don't wanna lick a rock ! Dx\ 
I'm just gonna spend all night cramming my head full of Russian . \ 
If this frickin ' program will stop being stupid >.> 
Now I kind of have to go to the lock-in ... And it's kinda freaking me out :/ 
If I had a shotgun , you know what I'd do , I'd point that shit straight at the sky and shoot heaven on down for you . 
If I ever get a boyfriend , I hope he's a real man . Because I'm so in the mood to wrestle right now . xD 
Thank the gods that is done and over with . xP 
I swear , I might actually hate my brother . 
This is how it works , you peer inside yourself . You take the things you like , and then you love the things you took . Then you take that love you made , and stick it into some-someone else's heart , pumping someone else's blood . And walking arm in arm , you hope it don't get harmed , but even if it does you'll just do it all again . 
It has been said , that everlasting friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question the friendship . These types of friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been or how faraway they live , and they don't hold grudges . They understand that life is busy , but you will ALWAYS ..... love them . Re-post if you have at least 1 of these friends .... 
Mmmm , Kon-El . Way hotter than the original . 
Hey bitch , don't quit . You're almost dead ; don't give up now , make friends instead . 
=.= \ I'm sooo tired . I feel like I got an hour of sleep at the most . " 
P.S. I Love You is such a great movie . \ 
xP Fuck < PROPFIRST>'s Day , I'm going for a sappy depressing movie marathon . \ 
Maybe learn a bit more Russian ... 
I follow the night ; can't stand the light . When will I begin to live again ? \ 
One day I'll fly away , leave all this to yesterday . \ 
Why live life from dream to dream , and dread the day when dreaming ends ... 
\This concept of wuv confuses and infuriates me !!! \ " \ 
v.v fml . 
I've been dealing with this fucking attraction for four years . Can't it just go away !? :/ 
Holy shit , youtube secretly has the Snake game in all of it's videos . O.o 
Dx Looking for a haircut is so fucking difficult , even if I kinda figure out what I need , I have no idea how to find one that will work for me , so I end up doing the same thing . \ 
:/ Fuck . I just need some channngeeeee ! 
Call me what you will , but call me again . It's true I don't talk too much . \ 
Because our lips won't last forever , and that's exactly why , I'd rather live in dreams and I'd rather die . \ 
Pretty face could you make the jump with me ? Cause I'm dying just to let things go . 
I'm so bloody awkward . But it was still really nice to actually talk to someone . \ 
xP :] 
I see your face and suddenly I feel like I've walked into a brick wall . I'm disoriented , in pain , and regardless of how many times it happens , it still seems like the wall came out of nowhere . \ 
I can't blame anyone but myself , but what the hell can I do ? \ 
All I know is that I'm sick of feeling like shit over some built up idea of \you \"; and that you're still the most attractive man I've ever met . " 
Put this as your status and see what you get ! ? \ 
I love your _________________________ ... ? 
Things I have loved , I'm allowed to keep . I'll never know , if I go to sleep . 
NO CHEATING : Post this as your status ( even if you're \TAKEN \") and see what people want from you . \ " INBOX ONLY\ " =} \ 
\Pumpersnickle ! The best word in the unitard ! \ " - < PROPFEMALE > Hoots\ 
Haven't laughed that much or had that much fun in a long time :] 
Go to your profile . The top 5 friends in the sidebar are on your team in the upcoming Zombie Apocalypse . How screwed are you ? \ 
I got < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > Jentzen , < PROPMALE > Walston , < PROPFEMALE > Cain , and < PROPFIRST > Falconer ... \ 
I get the feeling I'd end up dying protecting < PROPFIRST > , he is my little brother after all xD But it'd be good to have < PROPFEMALE > , she's really smart , and < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > would probably be good with guns ...? 
I just keep avoiding the tabs I have opened for researching . Must fight-urge-to-PROCRASTINATE . xP 
Fly me to the < PROPFEMALE > , and let me play among the stars . Let me see what spring is like on Jupiter and Mars . \ 
In other words , hold my hand ; in other words , darling kiss me . \ 
Fill my heart with song , and let me sing forever more . Cause you are all I long for , all I worship and adore . \ 
In other words , please be true ; in other words , I love you . 
I think I can , I think I can , I think I can ! \ 
Get this god damn paper written !!! 
v.v Well , the x-rays were useless . I just wanna know what it fucking is xP 
Red = I love you . * Pink = Your cute . * Green = Your funny . * orange = I like you . * White = annoying . * Yellow = Your amazing . * Blue = Friends 4Ever . * Purple = I don't know you that well . * Gold = Your sweet . * Silver = Your ... hot . * Rainbow = Everything . \ 
If your too embarrassed to comment and say it send it in a message . 
I don't know why I watch these ridiculous videos \proving\ " god and \ " disproving\ " non-theistic ideas 
I just read a line that said , \Photographs are the bastard children of < PROPMALE > and history . \ " \ 
Call me what you will , but call me again . It's true , I don't talk too much ... \ 
Because our lips won't last forever , and that's exactly why I'd rather live in dreams ... I'd rather die . \ 
Could you make the jump with me ? I'm dying just to let things go ... 
Dude , everyone . The Room is gonna be on Adult Swim at 12:30 tomorrow ... \ 
I promise , you won't regret it . * cough * 
I need a man . Someone who can give me a massage when my back suddenly feels like there's a knife lodged in it . And ya know , for all of the other reasons xD \ 
This is just the more immediate one . 
Look me in the eye and tell me you don't find me attractive , \ 
Look me in the heart and tell me you won't go . \ 
Look me in the eye and promise no love is like our love , \ 
Look me in the heart and unbreak broken , it won't happen . 
Maybe I'll catch fire , something warm to hold me , something pure to burn away the darkness that hides inside my mind . \ 
All that evil shits not hard to find , I guess I only claim to be nice .
