The venomous bite of the Brazilian wandering spider can cause massively painful erections that last for many hours . I find this both hilarious and terrifying . 
Apparently , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > did not die from cardiac arrest . He died from food poisoning . When paramedics found his body , he had 8 year old nuts in his mouth .

NHL officiating is a goddamn fuckin joke . 
Punk Rock Fucking Sucks .

Is there a greater group of incompetent morons in the universe than the employees of the US Postal Service ? 
Petville song is epic . I can't stop singing it .

If I could transform into an animal , I would be a sharkbearsnake . I would have the size and strength of a bear , the head of a shark , and the tail and reflexes of a snake . I would be the most badass animal ever . 
Happy Groundhog Day .... again ....

Yeeeahhh Wings win !! Let's close this thing out on Sunday . Hockey doesn't belong in the friggin ' desert anyway . 
Obsequious and arrogant , clandestine and vain . Two thousand years of misery , of torture in my name . Hypocrisy made paramount , paranoia the law . My name is called religion , sadistic , sacred whore . 
Go F *** Yourself , Puh-Hoe-Nix !!!

FUCK YOU < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > 
I've had some time to calm down and digest the situation , but I am still pissed . A perfect game has only been accomplished 20 times in MLB history , and for some blind asshole ump to cost a good kid like Galarraga a perfect game is just unacceptable . It's an even bigger slap in the face to Detroit sports considering how badly we've been fucked recently ... why are refs/umpires never held accountable for their actions ? 
Who is your daddy and what does he do ? 
So where are all the ' Save the Gulf ' concerts ? Where are the T.V. Benefits with celebrities and musicians giving heart felt speeches on the poor fisherman , wildlife , beaches , loss of income , and sabotaged gulf economy ? I find it strange how these people ( including our own government ) are so quick to help Haiti and other countries but sit on their asses for this one . Re-post if you agree !! 
got some Farmville ice cream from 7-11 :-P 
Help rescue animals hurt by the Gulf oil spill disaster . Play Happy Pets and buy the Peewee Duck and 100% of the net proceeds get donated to the National Wildlife Federation ! http://bit.ly/SaveAnimals2 
I like sugar , and I like tea ... 
ate an entire chicken ... is gonna barf ..... 
R.I.P. < PROPMALE > Probert 
Hahaha wow ... Lebron < PROPFIRST > is officially the biggest douchebag in the history of professional sports . 
Free < PROPFIRST > ! 
Yay Blissfield Royals , you're just so awesome ! 
What happened to Cheesy Taco Easy < PROPMALE > ? Why can't I find it in stores anymore ?? 
FOX pulled all of their sports programming from Dish Network over some sort of dispute -- can't watch the Red Wings tonight . F *** YOU FOX !! 
loves that the Red Wings spoiled Shitcago's < PROPMALE > Cup banner party . Suck it , Blackhawks ! The Cup will be back in Detroit where it belongs . 
Lions win !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
is really pissed that Dish Network and Fox can't resolve their little pissing contest and return our regional sports channels . I hate having to stream Red Wings games over the internet . If I ever see < PROPFIRST > Ergen I am going to punch that friggin ' hillbilly right in the balls . 
Hmmmm , should I reactivate my WoW account after 2 year hiatus ? Must ... resist .... 
Congrats Ozzie on win #400 !!!!!!!! :D 
Johan Franzen is a beast !!! 
does anyone have a Demonoid.me invite code they could send me ? 
Being a Lions fan , I hate the Packers . But I hate Rapey < PROPMALE > and the Steelers even more , sooo ... yay I guess . I'm really waiting for < PROPFIRST > Kardashian's new commercial . :P ~ 
HALFTIME SHOW FROM HELL -- MAKE IT STOP !!!!! 
Way to go , Red Wings ! It's about goddamn time you showed up . 
< PROPMALE > Cabrera may be a real knucklehead , but I have to admit that telling the cop that pulled you over to ' fuck off ' and then taking a swig from your bottle of scotch right in front of his face ... that's just friggin ' boss ! 
Another solid Red Wings victory , that's 4 in a row ! Now I'm gonna go play some Pokemon . 
Just got my Celebi for Pokemon HeartGold version at Gamestop ! Time to pwn some Pokemon trainers ! :-D 
Encountered a shiny Girafarig in Pokemon HG , but accidentally ran from it when I was trying to open my bag . FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
< PROPFIRST > College is playing in the NCAA Div III hockey championship game tonight , Michigan is playing for a trip to the NCAA Div I hockey semifinals as well , and the Red Wings are taking on the < PROPFEMALE > Leafs . Nothing beats hockey in the State of Michigan ! 
Versus NHL coverage is fucking terrible . I hate it when they have exclusive games on this shit network and I can't watch them on our local channel , where the broadcasters actually have a friggin ' clue . < PROPFIRST > Milbury is an absolute ass clown . 
Fuck this shit !! Get it together , Red Wings . This is embarrassing . >:( 
Warrior needs beer badly ! 
What sort of retarded clown school does the NHL send its referees to ? Some of these calls are just mind-boggling . What a joke ! 
F *** You , Nashville ! How does < PROPFIRST > Cleary's ass taste ? 
Sorry friends , I don't play any facebook games anymore . Feel free to delete me from your friends list , unless you think I am totally awesome and cool , and share my hobbies such as worshiping Satan and early Hungarian cabinet making .
