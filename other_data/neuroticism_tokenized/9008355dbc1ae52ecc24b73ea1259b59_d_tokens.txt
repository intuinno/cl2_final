I wonder why people think they need dates to dances . If you're not dating anyone , you don't like anyone , and you want to have a good time with all of your friends , then you don't need a date . Better to dance with the whole group than with one person in particular in this case . 
Secretly , all I want is someone to care about me . But every time someone tries , I push them away because I'm too afraid of getting hurt . \

Now , I have no one and all I have to blame is myself . ( sixbillionsecrets.com )
