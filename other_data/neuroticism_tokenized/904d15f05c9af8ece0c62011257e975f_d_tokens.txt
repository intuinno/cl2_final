Wizard's First Rule : People will believe a lie because they want to believe it's true , or because they're afraid it might be true . 
Wizard's Second Rule : The greatest harm can result from the best intentions . Kindness and good intentions can be an insidious path to destruction . Sometimes doing what seems right is wrong , and can cause harm . The only counter to it is knowledge , wisdom , forethought , and understanding the First Rule . Even then , that is not always enough . 
Wizard's Third Rule : Passion rules reason . 
Wizard's Fourth Rule : There is magic in sincere forgiveness ; in the forgiveness you give , but more so in the forgiveness you receive . 
Wizard's Fifth Rule : Mind what people do , not only what they say , for deeds will betray a lie . 
Wizard's Sixth Rule : The only sovereign you can allow to rule you is reason . 
Wizard's Seventh Rule : Life is the future , not the past . 
Wizard's Eight Rule : Talga Vassternich . Deserve Victory . 
Wizard's Ninth Rule : A contradiction can not exist in reality . Not in part , nor in whole . 
Wizard's Tenth Rule : Willfully turning aside from the truth is treason to one's self . 
Wizard's Eleventh Rule : \The Rule Unspoken \""
