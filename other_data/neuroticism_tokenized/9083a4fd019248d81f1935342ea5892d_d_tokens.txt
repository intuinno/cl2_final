Wow it's not even noon yet and I've already been attacked with the birthday punches lol 
Man my brother is such a little baby he hid in the closet again because of the thunder lmao 
I kinda wanna go back to school now :/ wtf ?? 
< PROPMALE > 54:17 
Fml . There's a freakin hole in my schedule so the stupid school is gonna put whatever classes they want in my schedule . :/ 
Yeah so school was really fun today I can't wait to go back tomorrow . :D 
Today was the best day ever . 
I should probably stop procrastinating and start on my book now ... 
When I'm older and I take over the world , I'm forever banning all homework , quizzes , tests , and unnecessary projects . 
Who's going to Blackouttt ? 
I don't feel like writing any books so I'm using the one I wrote in 5th grade . haha perfect . (: 
Why the heck is everyone playing farmville ? 
Blackout was so stupid I wasted my money :/ 
Oh . My . God . Everyone's getting sick . :/ 
I'd like you better with your mouth shut . (: 
Crap . I left my phone in < PROPFEMALE>'s purse :/ 
Does anyone know what time the one event starts ? 
Yeah I'm really bored so text me people 919.325.8579 
Does anyone that goes to Millbrook know what time we get out tomorrow ? I kept hearing different times because on MTV they said 12:00 , then on the announcements they said 12:28 , and I just went on the site and it said 11:58 . 
Facebook status abusers really get on my nerves . 
I hate going to school ... Everyone that sits near me in all of my classes is either sick or getting sick . :/ 
What is Millbrook 9 out of 10 ? 
Wow . So it turns out that Miley < PROPMALE > is gonna be in Sex and the City 2 . Awesome . That's a beautiful message sent to all the little girls who love her . (: 
hahahaaa did you guys know that there's music that gets you high ? Scientists developed it for recovering drug addicts lol that's so funny 
Today's pep rally made me realize that freshman probably get treated better than sophomores do . lol 
Why can't Colombus Day be a day that we can all celebrate at HOME , out of school ??? :/ 
Just got back from the choir concert at my school , and I am never singing again . 
Hahaha I just got back from the fair with < PROPFEMALE > Langan , and there was this grown man hitting on her lmao ... He tried to dance with her and he left to go get someone else and we started running hahahahahahhahahaha 
Dude someone tried to break into my house today ! :o 
My brother just called me a gremlin for pulling a prank on him ... What a haterrrr . lol 
Why is it that the second they finally get a Disney < PROPFEMALE > who's black , they make her kiss a frog ? 
Why is everyone posting colors as their statuses ? 
Yeahh it snowed ! I'M GOING FROLICKING ! lol (: 
I'm not going to Krav Maga tonight . >:| Curse you , stupid snow . 
During this week please change your profile picture to someone famous ( actor , musician , athlete ) you have been told you look like for the week ... post this to your profile and message your friends with it ... 
So I was sitting on the bus today , and I felt a strong urge to ask the person I had to sit with if they were a boy or a girl . I honestly could not tell . Lol 
* Alarm Clock * ( n ): An evil device invented by Satan to disrupt the peaceful sleep of otherwise happy people at a predetermined hour . 
< PROPFEMALE > Ammerman's racist , demonic cat decided it would be funny to pee on my leg as I slept . Thanks Chibi , thanks a lot . 
Eew everyone's getting sick . ): 
I'm so bored . I'm considering going to the gym dressed as a < PROPFEMALE > bar , standing in front of a fat guy on a treadmill , and waving at him while eating skittles . 
My alarm clock and I had a fight . It wanted me to get up , I refused . Things escalated . Now I'm awake and it’s broken . Not sure who won the fight . 
I want to know how the heck I can remember words to songs I haven't heard in years , yet I can't even remember what I walked into a room for . :/ 
Apparently , I'm a part of speech . A Gerund , to be exact . Thank you English , thanks a lot . 
Wow ! NASA found water on the < PROPFEMALE > . Maybe they should focus that technology to find the terrorists in caves on our own planet . 
People . Stop sending me FarmVille requests . Please . Lol 
I don't understand people who have 1000+ friends on here . Do they even talk to all of them ? Showoffs . 
So I forgot to wear green today , and I got pinched about 4 times for it . I ended up having to tape a small piece of green paper to my hand , showing it to everyone who wanted to pinch me . Haha suckerssss . (: 
So as I was leaving church , I saw this kid in the middle of the street jerking . Yes , jerking . What made it hilariously funny was that he almost got ran over by a car . Hahaha (: 
Great . It isn't even noon , yet I've experienced sexual abuse on my leg by , you guessed it , < PROPFEMALE > Ammerman's demonic cat , Chibi . 
So just now , < PROPFEMALE > and I were sitting outside enjoying the sun , until a large < PROPFEMALE > came from out of nowhere toward us . We both got freaked out , but then out of impulse , I ran inside , accidentally locked the door behind me , and locked < PROPFEMALE > outside with the < PROPFEMALE > ... Let's just say she's a little unhappy . (:< 
Forty days without meat is torture . Thank GOD it's finally Easter ! Now , I can resume my carnivorous habits . (:< 
Dude . It reallyyy needs to rain . I'm getting tired of this pollen attacking my face every two seconds ... |:< 
So I walked outside this morning , and a giant wave of pollen flew in my face . Great . Oh yeah , did I mention that I'm ALREADY sick from this blasted pollen ?! D:< 
I can't really remember , but I think\ 
my life must have been a lot more productive before I discovered Facebook ... 
Yeah so I just got kicked in the face by < PROPFEMALE > Ammerman's cat ( Chibi for all who do not know of her evil ) . That little wretched beast has one more time . One more time !!! |:< 
Facebook : A place where you discover that people you once respected can't spell . 
I just backhanded my brother . Before you go gasping and calling me a horrible person , it was a reflex . And it was hilarious . (:< 
I can't believe I have to sneak around in my own house ... My brother said when I come out of my room , I'm getting it . Dude , \it\ " can mean anything . I'm scared . Lol " 
To those who wished me happy birthday , thank you . Your lives will be spared when I take over the world . To those who didn't , I'm afraid I have some bad news ... 
I need a break from North < PROPFEMALE > ... 
I'm sick of seeing fat men mowing their lawns without shirts . Come on , I know it's hot , but please , be considerate of the children . Think of the children ! 
Ugh . I hate the taste of tap water . I might as well be licking metal . |:< 
Okayy . So update to my last status . I didn't wanna drink the water , and my brother was bothering me , so I took it upon myself to splash the water in his face like they do on the movies in bars . And it was awesome . (:< 
So they've come out with a new phone that allows you send texts with your voice . People are actually buying it . I would like to meet this guy who pitched this idea and shake his hand . That is perhaps the greatest scam ever . 
This , right here , is my ... status . (: 
I just noticed that most of the fat female teachers I've had were really mean . Just because their lives are going nowhere , why do they have to try to ruin everyone else's ? 
Yesterday , I sprained my neck . And now that I think about it , during the past week , I've been having a lot of injuries , 90% of them inflicted upon me by < PROPFEMALE > Ammerman . 
I was just prank called by someone with a fake African accent who called themselves \Detective Lethal\ " and said that they were coming to arrest me . Lol I've had my laugh of the day . " 
So Chibi , < PROPFEMALE > Ammerman's demonic cat , decided to slap a cookie I was eating out of my hand . If that wasn't enough , that furry little monster then attacked and crushed the fallen cookie . All I wanted was the stupid cookie . I've never felt more bullied . 
This stupid \2010 election\ " nonsense is really interfering with my TV time . Get the heck off my screen !! " 
... What the heck is a \Why What's up \"?" 
I love how in tv shows , students always seem to know where the teacher lives , and can just drop by whenever they want . Haha . 
So earlier , I tried to put my green thumb to the test by planting some orange seeds in my backyard . Thirty minutes later , I watched helplessly from the window as small squirrel dug up and carried away my seeds . Little spawns of Satan . |:< 
I was having a very good time frolicking in the snow , when four very sketchy looking hawks started circling above my head . My frolicking ended early . |:< 
I got to watch my principal fall in the ice today , along with many other teachers . Score . (: 
Hi , I'm Jarin and my hobbies include heeding < PROPFEMALE>'s every wish and frolicking in fields of daises . - < PROPFEMALE > :) 
Well , since I've sprained my neck , again , there will be no more whipping my hair back and forth until further notice . :/ 
... Why do people insist on wearing clothes that are too tight for them ? It's disgusting , and a little traumatizing . |:< 
I wanna marry < PROPFIRST > Bublé's voice . :O 
My God , Girl Scouts are way too aggressive with their cookie selling methods nowadays . -_- 
Tomorrow is St. < PROPFIRST>'s Day . I plan on wearing green , so if someone wrongfully pinches me , they're getting kicked in the face . (: 
There's a little fox chillin in my backyard . ... Am I wrong for wanting to capture it ? Haha (: 
Lol , a giant < PROPFEMALE > keeps hurling itself at the window . What an idiot . 
I bumped into a chair today . What really made me feel stupid was when I apologized to it , mistaking it for a person . -__- 
Lady GaGa makes me sick . >:| 
Sheesh , Judgment Day isn't happening today . No man knows the day or hour . And plus , Kanye West will probably try to interrupt Jesus anyway . 
I found a turtle today ! His name is < PROPMALE > . I am one step closer to taking over the world . >:) 
I got a B in English ! Yessssssss ! :D 
< PROPFEMALE > Ammerman is the most amazing person in the world . I'm forever in her debt . * Bows down * 
So the guy that kept saying the world was gonna end just had a stroke . I feel like that was God's way of saying , \Dude . Shut up . \ " haha " 
Alright , so I have some good news and some bad news . The bad news is that < PROPMALE > ( my turtle ) escaped last night . Little punk . The good news is , < PROPMALE>'s a girl , and she laid eggs ! :) 
Went through the \10 Items or Less\ " line with 14 items in my basket . Thug life . " 
I got a 3 on the AP English exam ! >:D \ 
... But seriously . That's surprising though . 
I just saw a cow running . I didn't know they could do that . Don't judge me . Lol 
Hello ! My name is Jarin and I like to watch my self shake it in the mirror from the hours of 9:30 A.M. - 10:30 A.M. 
I got bored and Googled myself . Man , I really need a hobby . -__- lol
