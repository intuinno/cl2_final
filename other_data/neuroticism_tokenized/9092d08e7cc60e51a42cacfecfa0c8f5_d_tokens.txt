Can we all admit that reality TV has nothing to do with reality ? 

LOVES HOW HIS NAME RHYMES WITH GAY !!!! YYYAAAAAAYYYYY !!!! WHEEEEEEEEEEEE !!!! 
Coffee is awesome !!! 
I believe American Idol should be fought with guns . 
I love being drunk . Why can't I feel like this sober ? 
Why do some people live for drama ? It seems they are not happy unless they are bitching about something . 
I have tasted a life wasted and I'm never going back again . PJ 
Caught a bolt of lightning , cursed the day he let it go 
i guess it was the beatings made me wise but i'm not about to give thanks , or apologize 
I know I was born and I know that I'll die The in between is mine I am mine 
oh half his life , a hand me down , wasted away , he fills it up , with the love , of a girl 
up here in my tree newspapers matter not to me no more crowbars to my head i'm trading stories with the leaves instead 
Going to my brother's to watch the game . Why can't it be on saturday night ? Having to go to work hungover sucks . 
I think Americn Idol should be fought with guns . I think they would try harder . 
I feel the pain of everyone Then I feel nothing -- Dinosaur Jr. 
Nothing says love like half wilted Wal-Mart flowers and a card picked out in haste the day before . Can you feel the love people ? Happy Valentines Day everyone . 
I can't believe my son is 15 today . 
You Live it or Lie it . My lifestyle determines my deathstyle . 
WARNING WARNING My son got his learners permit this week . Drivers beware 
Whatever did happen to your soul ? I heard you sold it To some old boy who lived uptown Who could afford it So what's gonna happen to you now ? Therapy ... the pharmacy -- Afghan Whigs 
This is my < PROPMALE > , this is my life And my opening hour This is my choice , this is my voice There may be no tomorrow This is my plea , this is my need This is my time for standing free This is my step , this is my depth In a world demanding of me But is's okay ....... Dead < PROPFEMALE > 
Fat people shouldn't snow ski . Just ask my right knee . Going for an MRI tomorrow . 
Happy Easter to all my friends . 
Wednesday is almost here . 4 years of college football and no knee injuries . 20 minutes of snow skiing & shred my right knee . Best vacation ever ! Lol 
Surgey went well . I'll get to go home tomorrow 
Thanks for all the birthday wishes everyone . 
I'm so happy ' cause today I found my friends They're in my head I'm so ugly , that's okay ' Cause so are you Broke our mirrors Sunday morning is everyday For all I care And I'm not scared Light my candles , in a daze ' Cause I've found God 
I'm feeling that I'm sober Even though I'm drinking Well , I can't get any lower Still I feel I'm sinking 
If you do something for me just to hold it over my head and remind me of it constantly , I'd rather you take that favor and shove it up your ass . 
If at first you don't succeed , you may suck at what you are trying to do . 
Like a midget in a urinal , I was going to have to be on my toes . 
I don't mind the sun sometimes The images it shows I can taste you on my lips And smell you in my clothes Cinnamon and sugary And softly spoken lies You never know just how you look Through other people's eyes 
Boss demon tells me \ 
Oh how he would like to kill me \ 
Save your bullets tough guy\ 
My disease does that for free\ 
Well I don't know if I'm coming or going \ 
If it's them or me \ 
Oh , but one things for certain\ 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > only smokes killer weed 
Tell the captain \ 
\This boats not safe 
Found love found hate\ 
Saw my mistake\ 
Broke walls of pain\ 
to walk again\ 
I saw the dream\ 
I saw the wake\ 
We shared it all\ 
But not the take 
< PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > once kicked a horse in the < PROPFEMALE > . Its decendants are known today as Giraffes . 
< PROPMALE > < PROPMALE>' first job was as a paperboy . There were no survivors . 
If you pause Lion < PROPMALE > at a certain point , < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > can clearly be seen shitting on Simba 
< PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > is 1/8th Cherokee . This has nothing to do with ancestry , the man ate a Indian . 
When you open a can of whoop-ass , < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > jumps out . 
Actually , it only takes one drink to get me loaded . Trouble is , I can't remember if it's the thirteenth or fourteenth . 
Without coffee , I feel there would be MANY more murders committed during morning hours . 
You ever heard the story of Mr. Faded < PROPFEMALE > ? \ 
Say he who rides a pony must someday fall \ 
Talkin ' to my alter , life is what you make it \ 
And if you make it death well rest your soul away 
Baby will you be my corona and lime . \ 
And I will be your main squeeze . \ 
And if your brother don't like my style . \ 
We could take it to the street . 
I had a stick of CareFree gum , but it didn't work . I felt pretty good while I was blowing that bubble , but as soon as the gum lost its flavor , I was back to pondering my mortality . 
I have the world's largest collection of seashells . I keep it on all the beaches of the world ... perhaps you've seen it . 
Rice is great if you're really hungry and want to eat two thousand of something . 
Four years ago ... No , it was yesterday . Today I ... No , that wasn't me . \ 
Sometimes I ... No , I don't . 
I like refried beans , that's why I wanna try fried beans . Cause maybe they're just as good , and we're wasting time . You don't have to fry them again , after all . 
I'm writing a book . I've got the < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > done , so now I just have to fill\ 
in the rest . 
Ever notice how dogs are always in the push up position ? 
Curiosity killed the cat , but for a while I was a suspect . 
I would imagine if you could understand Morse Code , a tap dancer would drive you crazy 
Everywhere is within walking distance if you have the time . 
I think Bigfoot is blurry , that's the problem . It's not the photographers ' fault ! Bigfoot is blurry ... and that's extra scary to me . Cause there's a large , out-of-focus monster roaming the countryside . 
I'd like to sing you a song now about my old girlfriend . It's called , \They'll Find Her When the Leaves Blow Away ' Cause I'm Not Raking ' Til Spring . \"" 
I believe in making the world safe for our children , but not our children's children , because I don't think children should be having sex 
I hope that after I die , people will say of me : ' That guy sure owed me a lot of money ' . 
Even though he was an enemy of mine , I had to admit that what he had accomplished was a brilliant piece of strategy . First , he punched me , then he kicked me , then he punched me again . 
Turn your back on me \ 
and make believe that you're always happy\ 
It's safe to say you're never alive\ 
A big part of you has died and by the way , \ 
I hope you're satisfied 
My pain is self-chosen\ 
At least I believe it to be\ 
I could either drown\ 
Or pull off my skin and swim to shore\ 
Now I can grow a beautiful shell for all to see 
Hope my ambien kicks in soon 
Guess I should have been a little clearer on \soon \"" 
Ambien sucks the hardest suck that ever sucked a sucked . I thought 15mg was a lot . OBVIOUSLY NOOOOOT !!!! 
I'm about to start the random ramblings of a guy who is starting to wig the F out ! 
I like toast 
You know why there is no such thing as soy milk ? Because a soy titty does not exsist . You are driking soy juice . 
You know one thing that will really make a woman mad ? Just run up and kick her in the butt . ( P.S. This also works with men . ) 
To me , clowns aren't funny . In fact , they're kinda scary . I've wondered where this started , and I think it goes back to the time I went to the circus and a clown killed my dad 
In weightlifting , I don't think sudden , uncontrolled urination should automatically disqualify you 
I remember one day I was at Grandpa's farm and I asked him about sex . He sort of smiled and said , ' Maybe instead of telling you what sex is , why don't we go out to the horse pasture and I'll show you . ' So we did , and there on the ground were my parents having sex 
You know what would make a good story ? Something about a clown who makes people happy , but inside he's real sad . Also , he has severe diarrhea 
I hope that someday we will be able to put away our fears and prejudices and just laugh at people 
Anytime I see something screech across a room and latch onto someone's neck , and the guy screams and tries to get it off , I have to laugh , because what IS that thing ?! 
I feel like hammered sh*t . Screw ambien . It's < PROPFIRST > Daniels and water tonight . If I cant sleep then I'll drink til I pass out . 
I love all my friends but this farmville crap is getting old . How about we all take a field trip to an actual farm ? I lived on one for a while . They are not that fun . 
Got physical therapy today for my knee . If we ever capture a terrorist , I'm positive my therapist could get him to talk . 
Ice is awesome . My therapist must read my posts because she kicked my butt today . 
Sunday is father's day and the best present I ever received was my son . He is everything I should have been at 15 . 
Went to church with the family . I was proud to be there with my son . Perfect father's day present . 
If you act like being a parent is your part time job , don't be surprised one day if your child fires you . 
Do they make a coffee I V ? That would save me so much time . That way , I could just have it drip into my arm and I wouldn't have to get for refills . 
You can’t write if you can’t relate\ 
Trade the cash for the beef for the body for the hate\ 
And my time is a piece of wax fallin’ on a termite\ 
who's chokin’ on the splinters 
It's been two months since my knee surgery . I celebrated by going for a two mile walk tonight . Thanks Dr. < PROPMALE > 
Ever notice how < PROPFIRST > Mouse's best friend is Goofy and his pet is Pluto ? They are BOTH dogs !! I bet that makes them feel really uncomfortable at the dinner table . Goofy is sitting there at the table and Pluto is begging at their feet . I'm just sayin . 
All right stop collaborate and listen ........ 
It's just another Manic Monday . Oh oo whoa I wish it was Sunday . \ 
Yeah I'm singing The Bangles . What of it ? 
Oh , there ain't no rest for the wicked , \ 
Money don't grow on trees . \ 
I got bills to pay , \ 
I got mouths to feed , \ 
There ain't nothing in this world for free . \ 
I know I can't slow down , \ 
I can't hold back , \ 
Though you know , I wish I could . \ 
No there ain't no rest for the wicked , \ 
Until we close our eyes for good ---- Cage the Elephant 
I love it when the rain knocks out my direct tv signal . 
You can figure out how to beam a signal down from outer freakin space but the rain thing has got you stumped ? Really ? 
You live it or lie it . My lifestyle determines my deathstyle . 
Now here's a little story I've got to tell\ 
About three bad brothers you know so well\ 
It started way back in history\ 
With Adrock , M.C.A. , and me - < PROPFIRST > D . 
I have faced it , a life wasted\ 
I'm never going back again\ 
I escaped it , a life wasted\ 
I'm never going back again 
I was drunk the day my mom got out of prison . And I went to pick her up in the rain . 
Me and my son just ate lunch at Hamill's in < PROPFEMALE > . If anyone is ever over this way and wants some good southern cooking , go there . Good lord I am beyond stuffed . 
I love my i touch but it's made me ADHD with my music . I don't think I've listened to an entire song in my car since I got this thing . 
God bless all of the families of those who serve this country . Your children have made it possible for us to celebrate today . Thank you . God bless the USA . 
Sick and tired of being sick and tired . \ 
Everything around you's growin ' old . \ 
The days drag on , the nights last forever , \ 
Every day's tougher just to keep it together . \ 
Forget everything you've ever known , \ 
Except for home . 
Some days it's just not worth chewing through the straps on my bed . 
I can't wait for our 20 year class reunion . If I need to apologize to anyone , please let me know so i can get something on paper beforehand . Thanx 
Just got back from the mall with < PROPFEMALE > . I was brutally tortured on the way home with her new Air Supply Greatest Hits cd . I threw up in my mouth a little . The horror , the horror . 
Some days you're the windshield . Some days you're the bug . 
Before your time on earth is over , I highly recommend changing a flat tire while bending on your surgically repaired knee . And , just for poops and giggles do it on a rainy day . Bonus points for doing it in mud and gravel with a < PROPFEMALE > toy Japanese < PROPFIRST > that was obviously designed as a cruel joke . Have a blessed day . 
I had an absolute blast at our reunion . It was so awesome seeing everyone . I hope we don't wait that long to do it again . I wish we could have an all school reunion for the classes of 85-90 . But , again this weekend was great . Thanks to everyone who had a hand in putting it together . 
Can Mondays have menstrual cycles ? Because I haven't even had my coffee and this day has already kicked my butt up around my shoulders . 
If today were an ice cream flavor , it would be pralines and crap . 
I am now a married man ! 
Thanks to everyone for all the kind words . I'm truly a lucky man . 
A seven nation army couldn't hold me back

If you dont like my fire , then dont come around . \ 
Cause I'm gonna burn one down . 
Arguing on line is sort of like midget wrestling . Even if you win , you are still a midget . 
My new favorite team is Jacksonville State !!! HA HA HA HA !!! Another BCS party will be held this season and guess who is not invited ? 
Wake me up when September ends ....... 
Has anyone else been sick this past week ? This crap has knocked me on my butt . Sinus , ear , coughing , fever , aches . Everytime I think I'm getting better it sneaks up on me again . Been a week today . Some Labor day weekend . 
I am convinced < PROPFEMALE > McLachlan is an angel sent to earth to give us a preview of what heaven will sound like . 
Headed back to the doctor today . This sucks 
Go placidly amid the noise and haste , \ 
and remember what peace there may be in silence . \ 
As far as possible without surrender\ 
be on good terms with all persons . \ 
Speak your truth quietly and clearly ;\ 
and listen to others , \ 
even the dull and the ignorant ;\ 
they too have their story 
The Jets offense couldn't score in a brothel . Me , my son & 9 dead guys could have stopped them last night . 
I don't know but when you have a defense that only gives up 10 points you should win every time . Looks like they believed all the hype about them in the off season . Hopefully this will wake them up . 
I can always count on ole miss to cheer me up on the weekends . Can't wait to hear the excuses . 
Great news ! I'm getting a CAT scan done tomorrow morning to see why I have had a sinus & ear infection since the Wednesday before Labor Day . Whatever happened to good ol ' swine flu , avian flu or , oh I don't know , acid rain ? I wonder if I stick one of those vacuum hoses at the car wash on my ear , I could suck the infection out ? HMMM ... 
Hear the drummer get wicked 
Great game . Any Arkansas fans on here need to hold their heads high . That was a hard hitting game . 
Dang . That did not look good for that ole miss player . I bet he tore his knee up . Hate to see that . 
The good news ? I've lost 25 pounds . The bad news ? I still weigh 280 . 
Sinus surgery Friday . Should be loads of fun . 
The Dude abides . I don't know about you , but I take comfort in that . 
There is some serious hitting going on in the ole miss Kentucky game . 
Nervous about tonight . 2 top 10 SEC teams back 2 back ? Come on Tide , time to step up ! RTR ! 
< PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > should be fired tonight ! 
6 minutes . 6 minutes . 6 minutes , < PROPMALE > E . Fresh you're on . 
Going to see JJ Grey & MOFRO Saturday at < PROPMALE > & Mal's . Its going to be awesome ! Can't wait . 
Nothing like driving by a field and seeing a stud horse who is really happy to be there . I feel like I need to wash my eyes . 
Here's an idea . Instead of shutting down a whole town to run a freakin marathon , set up 1,000 treadmills in a field & just go nuts . Last one to drop wins & I can get my son to football practice . 
The Cocks are standing tall in South < PROPFEMALE > today . Wait that didn't sound right . Come on Bama beat those Cocks ! Uh , that didn't either . 
Good job South < PROPFEMALE > . Y'all were definitely the better team today . 
JJ Grey & MOFRO were great last night . I think the music was so loud it loosened up the fluid in my ears . 
I love the New York Jets , but if it comes out that they knew about all this Favre stuff while he was there & didn't do anything because he was on their team ...... I may just have to take a break from y'all for a while . 
Yeah there she was .... Like disco lemonade 
I hope the Tide can rebound this week against the ole miss bears . 
I just got \poked\ " on facebook . Should I be offended ? I don't think I like the idea of someone poking me . Or is it a good thing ? I'm confused . " 
I actually feel good today . Seems like this stuff is finally breaking up . 
I was at a 10th grade game for < PROPFEMALE > Central last night & unfortunately a player from < PROPMALE > was injured . He was carried to the hospital in a car . Why are ambulances not at these games ? Thankfully , it was nothing that required immediate medical attention . This has to change before the unthinkable happens . 
Such a classic girl 
Got more rhymes than Jamaica got lingo 
This year Halloween fell on a weekend . Me & Geto Boys are trick or treatin ' 
Wendy ? \ 
Yes < PROPFEMALE > . \ 
Is the water warm enough ? \ 
Yes < PROPFEMALE > \ 
Shall we begin ? \ 
Yes < PROPFEMALE > 
Lay Lady Lay 
Good job LSU . They wanted it more today . 
My get up & go has got up & went 
Anger is a gift . 
I'm madly in anger with you . 
You better bring your A game tonight Bama . State is the real deal . RTR 
Your love is better than chocolate\ 
Better than anything else that I’ve tried\ 
Oh love is better than chocolate\ 
Everyone here knows how to cry 
Labron < PROPFIRST > asked in his commercial , \What should I do ? \ " . Here's an idea : WIN . You should never be mentioned in the same breath as Kobe or < PROPFIRST > or < PROPMALE > because they are winners . You have a high school championship . " 
I like my sugar with coffee & cream . 
2 all of the sportscasters who r makin a big deal of the commercial Kobe is n , shut th hell up . Your over the top PC BS is the problem in this world

MC 27 - NW 20 FINAL . South Panola next week . Oh joy . 
Even tho I'm a huge Bama , I really hope Cam < PROPMALE > is cleared of any wrong doing . He's the best player in college 
Happy Thanksgiving everyone . The computer is officially shut down . 
My wife's dad passed away earlier tonight . On this Thanksgiving , I am very thankful that I got to know him over the past couple of years . I feel I am a better person having known him . Rest in peace Mr. Brown . 
Hello everyone . < PROPFEMALE > wanted everyone to know that services for her father will be Monday , 11/29/10 , from 6-8pm at Stringers Funeral Home in Hazlehurst . Thanks to all for your kind messages & prayers . 
Despite all my rage , I'm still just a rat in a cage . 
I'm beginning to regret having sinus surgery . 
At the doctor now . Hopefully he'll hook a shop vac to my nose & just go nuts . 
Well I got my wish . My nose was cleaned out thoroughly . The foot long tweezers to do it seemed an odd choice but it worked . 
I know a man who gave up smoking , drinking , sex , and < PROPMALE > food . He was healthy right up to the day he killed himself . \

I predict future happiness for Americans if they can prevent the government from wasting the labors of the people under the pretense of taking care of them . \

I submit to you that if a man hasn't discovered something that he will die for , he isn't fit to live . 
Our scientific power has outrun our spiritual power . We have guided missiles and misguided men . \ 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > 
< PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > , you are a disgusting human being and are the poster boy for what is wrong with our government and country . 
In the End , we will remember not the words of our enemies , but the silence of our friends . \ 
Nothing seems to kill me , no matter how hard I try\ 
Nothing is closing my eyes\ 
Nothing can beat me down for your pain or delight . \ 
Nothing seems to break me , no matter how far I fall\ 
Nothing can break me at all\ 
Not one for giving up though not invincible , I know\ 
I've given everything I could\ 
To blow it to hell and gone\ 
Burrow down and then blow up the outside world 
Go on & wring my neck \ 
Like when a rag gets wet \ 
A little discipline \ 
4 my pet genius \ 
My head is like lettuce \ 
Go on dig your thumbs in \ 
I cannot stop givin\ 
I'm thirty-somethin \ 
Sense of security \ 
Like pockets jinglin \ 
Midlife crisis \ 
Suck ingenuity \ 
Down through the family tree \ 
Youre perfect , yes , its true \ 
But without me you're only u \ 
Your menstruating heart \ 
It aint bleedin ' enough for 2 \ 
It's a midlife crisis

Thank God our defense showed up . Back to back AFC Championship Games , do I dare to dream ? 
A nation or civilization that continues to produce soft-minded men purchases its own spiritual death on the installment plan . \ 
I will hold the candle till it burns up my arm\ 
I'll keep takin ' punches until their will grows tired\ 
I will stare the sun down until my eyes go blind\ 
I won't change direction , and i won't change my mind 
Or pull off my skin and swim to the shore\ 
I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find \ 
I can't see the things that make true happiness , I must be blind \ 
Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry \ 
Happiness I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal \ 
And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state \ 
I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too late\

Well , I played ball every single fall , \ 
I could run just like the wind . \ 
Went to college like they asked me too\ 
But they didn't ask my friends . \ 
Don't think I seen a single classroom , \ 
But I drank a lot of beer . \ 
My buddies still love to listen to me when I talk about that year . 
We may have all come on different ships , but we're in the same boat now . \
