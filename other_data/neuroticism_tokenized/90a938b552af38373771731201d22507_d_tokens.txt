People are in our lives for a season , a reason , or lifetime . \ 
If someone is in your life for a lifetime , we are suppose to love them , & they will love us as family or great friends . If for a season they're like friends from school . We have fun & talk with them , but won't tell them all our secrets . And the ones for a reason are simple , they come in our lives to change us , or for us to change them . 
Happy New Year !!!! EAST COAST ! 
1 < PROPFIRST > 1:5 ESV\ 
The aim of our charge is love that issues from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith .

“Dance as though no one is watching you . Love as though you have never been hurt before . Sing as though no one can hear you . Live as though heaven is on earth . ” ... I'm going to keep trying to live this way , especially the \love like you've never been hurt\ " part - I know that is what God wants ... <3 and forgiveness is divine :) "

We can't always control the things that happen to us or around us ..... but we CAN control how we react and respond to these things :) 
Just when life seems to be going good ... BAM ! Hit right from behind , unexpected . I know where to go ( on my knees ) and what to do ( lift it up to my father in heaven ) . I know it is in His hands ... but for now , I'm still sad . 
Attitude is more important than the past , our failures , our successes , than what other people think , say & do . It'll make or break a company-a church-a home . We choose each day the attitude we'll have . We can't change our past-we can't change the fact that people will act in a certain way . I'm convinced that LIFE IS 10% WHAT HAPPENS TO ME & 90% HOW I REACT to it . We're in charge of our Attitudes . ~ CharlesSwindoll ~

Back at work on this freezing Monday morning . This is my busiest week of the year at work , and I'm ready to work it ! Let's \get-r-done \"!" 
I'll praise You in this storm , and I will lift my hands ; For You are who You are , no matter where I am \ ~ Casting Crowns ~ " 
I'll praise You in this storm , and I will lift my hands ; For You are who You are , no matter where I am ; Every tear I've cried , You hold in Your hand , You never left my side ... and though my heart is torn , I will praise You in this storm ... \ 
~ Casting Crowns ~ ( decided to add the rest of the verse , because it keeps running thru my head - I <3 this song ! ) 
INTEGRITY : Adherence to moral & ethical behavior ; Honesty . 
The Father & the Son are fully united in the laws by which They govern humankind . These laws show God's way of love & are given for the benefit of humankind ( 1 < PROPFIRST > 5:3 ; 2 < PROPFIRST > 6 ; Deuteronomy 5:33 ) . Those who oppose the laws of love bring untold suffering & misery upon themselves and others . Often these agonies are manifested in the form of broken relationships . ( Bible Study - Why the Bible is the Word of God ) 
Hold me close , Holy One , let Your loving comfort come . Help me pray , like your Son , not my will but YOURS be done . ( Letting Go album ) ... Lord you know my prayers . 
My chains are gone , I've been set free . My God , my Saviour has ransomed me . And like a flood His mercy reigns , unending love , amazing grace . ( < PROPFIRST > Tomlin ) 
is watching \Web Soup\ " with < PROPFIRST > 
~ SKILLET - I Trust You ~ \ 
When I can't see , I will trust You - And when I get weak , I trust You \ 
And when I just can't let it go - I trust that You are in control \ 
Shelter me so I can find some peace - Grabbing hold of You is letting go of me \ 
It's easy when I remember I possess all that lays beyond my grasp \ 
Your power commands the weight off my back \ 
Now I know I need You - Now I know I trust You 
< PROPFIRST > 3:16 
I am a flower quickly fading , Here today & gone tomorrow , A wave tossed in the ocean ; A vapor in the wind , Still You hear me when I'm calling , Lord You catch me when I'm falling , & You told me who I am , I am Yours . \ 
Who am I , that the eyes that see our sin , Would look on me with love , & watch me rise again ? Who am I , that the voice that calmed the sea , Would call out through the rain , & calm the storm in me ? (CastingCrown ) 
Very very tired . Huge day at work tomorrow ( EOY ) so I'm about to head for bed . Lord , I pray for peace tonight and a good nights sleep . I <3 my family ! 
Thank you Lord for Your faithfulness as You lead my family thru this storm of turmoil , heartache & illness that life is throwing our way . I'm ready for today ! 
\Oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive\ " ( Sir < PROPFIRST > Scott-Poem \ " Marion \")" 
( Deep breath ) .... okay Lord . I'm ready for Your New Year . Just guide me with Your loving ways , I'll follow :) 
Woo Hoo ! First workday of the NEW YEAR ! I'm gonna make this one a GOOD one ! 
( Ephesians 4:32 ) And be kind to one another , tenderhearted , forgiving each other , just as God also in Christ forgave you . 
Love is like a puzzle . When you love , all the pieces fit but when your heart gets broken , it takes a while to get everything back together . ~ Author Unknown 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > said ... “Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it . ” ... so ... I THANK YOU LORD for the many many many blessings in my life ! My dear family , my job , my home and most of all , my salvation . <3 
Always be a first-rate version of yourself , \ 
instead of a second-rate version of somebody else . \ 
~ Judy Garland ~ 
There comes a time in life , when you walk away from all the drama and people who create it . You surround yourself with people who make you laugh , forget the bad , and focus on the good . So , love the people who treat you right . Forget about the ones who don't . Life is too short to be anything but happy . \ ( Re-post if you agree ) - I just did ! " 
Relationships are NOT a game to be played . Relationships are NOT a object to be toyed with . Relationships involve real people with real hearts & real love . 
Today you are You , that is truer than true . There is no one alive who is Youer than You . ~ Dr. Suess ~

Posted by a friend today : Take responsibility for your last bad decision , and then let it go . Don't blame others or make excuses for yourself . ~ Deepak Chopra ~ 
Got a new nurse hired for Grandma today ... RELIEF ! Now grandma is sleeping and I basically have the house to myself .

The math to this verse says 490x forgiveness-I know I've extended at least 90x forgiveness to this same person , how many more lies will surface ? I guess they have at least 400 more in grace they can spend . I KNOW-forgiveness is really UNLIMITED ( Matthew 18:21 -22 ) 
But he said to me , “My grace is sufficient for you , for my power is made perfect in weakness . ” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses , so that the power of Christ may rest upon me . For the sake of Christ , then , I am content with weaknesses , insults , hardships , persecutions , and calamities . For when I am weak , then I am strong . ~ 2 Corinthians 12:9 -10 ~ 
\You must have absolute faith in your own perceptions of truth . Never act in haste or hurry ; be deliberated in everything ; wait until you know the true way . \ " - < PROPMALE > D . Wattles " 
Lazy Sunday afternoon watching movies with < PROPFIRST > while getting some laundry done . Praying for family & friends ... and thanking the Lord for all He has blessed me with .

May your unfailing love be my comfort , according to your promise to your servant . 
Everyday is a NEW day ; awake & thank God !
