< PROPFEMALE>'s 1st guitar lesson went well today . The first thing I taught her ? Bending Notes >:-) 
hates the cold :P 
Just bought a new Co2 tank and wants to use it :P 
you know how far the east is from the west , one scarred hand to the other 
freezing temperatures + raking outdoors = not a good combination ... :P 
After a very close game of Settlers , I'm ready for bed . :) 
wishes the home school basketball team would start up again ... :P 
tea and coffee are excellent replacements for food in the morning . ;) 
When I feel like I am drifting away , \ 
Sinking down , the sails aren't shipping today , \ 
I'm about to lose my way , \ 
You anchor , anchor me down . 
paintball = awesome :) 
was at the church all day playing with my new ' toy ' . :) 
Is Baby-sitting . 
Apparently praise and worship songs are perfect for putting little children to sleep . ;) 
Worship this morning was AWESOME . :D 
beautiful day , if only I had something to do :) :P 
loving the weather :) 
New strings + new distortion pedal = one happy guitar :D 
My amp arrived in the mail , now I'm ready to rock the world ! :) 
cold , wet , overcast ... a formula for snow ... :P 
if I can use a guitar to melt faces , then does that mean I can melt snow too ? :D 
from < PROPFEMALE > to < PROPFEMALE > \ 
you are glorious you are glorious\ 
you are glorious you are glorious 
Basketball = Awesome \ 
Youth Group = Even awesomer\ 
today was good :) 
just picked up my new Contacts . Yay ! :) 
I'm glad God doesn't care how old you are , as long as your willing . Otherwise I would need to be 16 and have a license to lead worship ... ;) :P 
If we get more than 10 in . of snow b4 sunday , I'm wearing shorts to church . Just to defy nature . :) 
well , I've been reminded of how much I hate snow ... 
2 degrees below zero is just ridiculous ... :P 
I'm playing a worship song on guitar when Aria walks in and starts jumping up and down and dancing , at which point I hit my distortion pedal ... and she starts headbanging ... * sniff * I'm so proud . ;) 
has officially blacklisted all of the facebook apps . No more annoying game updates ! :) 
well , youth was ( as always ) a great end to the day . :) 
Lunch at Applebees then off to see Voyage of the < PROPFEMALE > Treader with < PROPFIRST > :) 
worship practice later . :D 
I will dance I will sing , to be mad for my king\ 
nothing Lord , is hindering this passion in my soul 
Worship was awesome today ! God is good ! :D 
worship practice :) 
what was 2010 to me ? the year I went from ' just another kid ' to a missionary and worship leader who is completely unashamed of Jesus ... oh yeah , it's also the year I turned 16 . :D ;) 
ahhhh ... it's all good . :) 
Hey , who turned the winter back on ? :P ;) 
praise him under open skies\ 
everything breathing praising God\ 
in the company , \ 
of all who love the < PROPMALE > 
just put in an application . hopefully I'll hear something back soon . :) 
Leadership meeting was intense , awesome , and intensely awesome . :D ;) 
dislikes Wisconsin state lawmakers ... particularly the ones in charge of driving laws ... :/ :P 
Is tired of being cold ... :P 
oh , for a thousand tongues to sing\ 
my great Redeemer's praise\ 
the Glories of my God and King\ 
the Triumphs of His Grace 
I have to say , four-way chess is pretty crazy . 
dragging recycle bins through snow should be a new Olympic sport ... :P 
Warning : Any one walking up the steps of our house may find themselves on the receiving end of one of Aria's gravity-related experiments . 
is playin ' da blues . :) 
whenever I need a lesson in humility , God never hesitates to give me one ... often in the form of an out-of-tune bass guitar . ;) 
I'm going to laugh so hard when the Packers lose the Superbowl ... xD 
Can't wait for tomorrow . 
is home . :) 
woke up this morning to the strange sensation of not recognizing myself in the mirror . :P 
Jam Session - A jam session is a musical act where musicians play ( i.e. \jam \") by improvising without extensive preparation or predefined arrangements . Often times jam sessions are thought to be ' more fun ' due to the freedom and opportunity to play with other musicians . " 
recording covers for songs seems to be the most efficient way to get them out of your head . :P ;) 
I wonder what the result would be in a writing/touring band being formed out of Grace's various worship groups . Probably something pretty awesome . Just saying . ;) 
I am now a Packers fan . :D 
I look outside and see\ 
the blanket on the ground\ 
In fact there's nothing else to see\ 
but the snow that's all around\ 
The gray that's in the sky\ 
the coldness of the air\ 
the weather all around me\ 
is anything but fair\ 
Oh how I wish to see\ 
something of the sun\ 
to be surrounded by her warmth\ 
to be outside and run 
Music really is a different language . How many people understand this ; ' Alright , I'm in Drop D tuning , playing an A minor Pentatonic over a Cmajor7 shape . ' 
Jaluzzock ( JA-lus-ock)\ 
A combination of Jazz , Blues , and Rock . Also referred to by many artists as ' awesomeness ' . A very free and moody form of playing that combines some light distortion with blues riffs and jazz rhythms . Excellent background music for social gatherings . 
Is really feeling basketball practice ... and I probably will be felling it for the rest of the week . :P :) youth group was gr8 though . :) 
now has an additional student :) 
you know , I have yet to see a valentines card at Walmart/Walgreen's ect . that says ' may I be yours ' as opposed to ' will you be mine ' ... 
* Insert Insightful Status Here * 
' Throw it in the wash , it'll be grand . ' 
Aria to the sleeping kitten : \1 ... 2 ... 3 ... WAKE UP JEFF !!! \"" 
music . 
well , the youth band now has a drummer , and he's pretty awesome . 
Is currently seeking employment . If anyone hears of anything be sure to let me know . Thanks :) 
is ready for worship tomorrow . :) 
If youth doesn't get canceled , I'll wear shorts . Just to defy the weather . :D 
Is in the mood the play da ' blues . 
you know someone's truly a worship leader when you ask them , ' What's the biggest audience you've ever played for ? ' and they say ' One . ' 
' The End ' : a beautiful thing to see in my math book . :D 
you know , if the protesters of the new < PROPMALE > wanted to do something to help their cause , they should invade Illinois and get their representatives back ... :P 
Ellie : < PROPMALE > , can you teach me to play the bass ? \ 
Me : Why ? \ 
Ellie : So i can play with the worship band . :D \ 
Me : I would , except for one thing ... \ 
Ellie : What ? \ 
Me : The bass is almost taller than you are . O.o \ 
gotta admire the willingness though :) 
* < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > 2012 * 
We are meant to be examples , \ 
And not idols to be praised ! \ 
Servants of the Most High , not rock stars ! \ 
New creatures in Christ , not rock stars ! \ 
' Not Rock Stars ' -Disciples 
B-ball practice + youth group = awesome day :) 
Me and < PROPFIRST > will both be playing at the Hartford Rec center ( in Hartford , 45 < PROPFEMALE > south of Fond Du Lac ) against WCHSA , on Saturday at 5:45 . There MAY be a cost for entry . The middle school game will be an hour before ours at 4:45 if you would like to watch their game . Let me know if you need directions . :) 
so yeah , good day today . :) 
To be a servant of Jesus is an infinitely more glorious position then being ruler of the world . And I'm proud to say that I am Jesus ' servant . :D 
Here's a riddle for you . What has four guitar players , a piano player , a violin player , a drummer , praises Jesus and sounds like pure awesomeness ? 
well , bowling was ALMOST as fun as youth group ;) 
The Platypus : Proof that God has a sense of humor . 
If anyone is interested in watching our basketball game later , it's at 3:00 at Lake Mills Middle School . The address is 318 College St. , Lake Mills WI if you need to mapquest it . The middle school game is at 2:00 . Hope you can make it :) 
hot showers . nothing like ' em . 
bowling is only fun if you have a bunch of people who cheer for you when you get a strike , or to high five you when you miss . hmm ... I suppose that's actually true of most things . :) 
your name is like < PROPFEMALE > on my lips\ 
your spirit like water to my soul\ 
your word is a lamp unto my feet\ 
Jesus I love you , I love you ... 
I'm falling even more in love with you\ 
Letting go of all I've held on to\ 
I'm standing here until you make me move\ 
I'm hanging by a moment here with you\ 
I'm living for the only thing I know\ 
I'm running and not quite sure where to go\ 
And I don't know what I'm diving into\ 
Just hanging by a moment here with you 
there's a song stuck in my head\ 
it just goes on and on my friend\ 
you see I started singing it , and before long I was\ 
playing and repeating it forever just because\ 
there's a song stuck in my head ... 
Awesome morning . Now I'm in for an awesome night . :) 
awesome night of worship . :D 
school , then VBS meeting later . :) 
I totally just fixed our xbox . Oh yeah , I'm a genius . :D 
If you cross the Wiggles with the Beach Boys and throw in a little hip-hop what do you get ? 
well ... now I understand all of the stories I've been hearing about ' Safety < PROPMALE>' ... :P 
* logs onto facebook and sees a notification*\ 
Yay ! :D \ 
* clicks notification*\ 
someone answered a question about me on friend quiz ...? \ 
* sigh * -_- 
Might just fall asleep in church . ;O Zzzzz 
is going to da church to play da music 
Just about time for bed . :) 
After today's guitar lesson , I'm wondering if I'm an awesome teacher , or if < PROPFIRST > just has some serious talent . Probably a bit of both . ;)
