still trying to recover from my severely sprained ankle . not so much fun . :( 
says when it rains it pours and it just keeps pourin ' ... cliche ' I know but oh so true !!! 
crap , I didn't just sprain my ankle , I have a slight fracture . I went to a foot and ankle doctor and he took x-rays and an ultra sound and then gave me a cortisone shot in the achilles tendon area which is where the fracture is to help calm down the inflamation and irritation . then he put a soft cast on and told me to come back in two weeks and we will see if any surgery is necessary . crap ... crap ... crap ......... 
Sooooo ... Grandma had her back surgery today , everything going well so far . Had her 2nd and 3rd vertebrae fused and will be in the hospital for the next day or two . One down , one to go . Mom goes in for her heart surgery friday . Needin ' some prayers . 
Mom is now in surgery and we will be getting updates as it goes on . She probably won't be done until around 4 p.m. they told us and then she will go into ICU for today . 
Mom is now out of ICU and doing well . The surgery went textbook well and she has been up a couple of times today . She is sleeping lots which is perfect , and wants to thank everyone for their thoughts and prayers . Will update more later . 
Today they did a chest x-ray to check on things . Unfortunately , her lower left lung is collapsed and they are concerned about the possibility of her getting pneumonia , so the doctor told her she may not go home until Tues or maybe even Wed . Mom is a bit upset over this , but they told her if she keeps using the breathing exerciser and walks the halls to get herself coughing that should help . 
Mom got to come home today . She still has to keep up \ 
her breathing excercises to get her lung inflated properly . We got her \ 
home and gave her medicine to her and she went to sleep for a bit . She \ 
is doing well and just needs to keep resting . 
Mom had chest x-ray yesterday and blood work and they told her that the lung is still not inflating like they would like but it is improving . Grandma is doing well , she is doing a little bit more walking around the house . I rescheduled my ankle appt for next week , so not sure what I will be looking at in that aspect yet . Thank-you all for your thoughts and prayers , they are greatly appreciated . 
Apparently , common sense isn't that common !! hmmmm ......

They gave me a prescription for pain meds so I'm gonna hope those kick in soon ... UUGGGHHHH !!!! IT HURTS !!!! 
Is trying to start with a better attitude today oh wait I did that yesterday and look how that turned out ... \ 
Now I get to go be tortured on different tooth on the opposite side .... 
So today wasn't too bad ... however I was properly informed by the surgeon and the other staff that it's the next few days that will become an issue for me . So far the ice packs and pain meds are keeping things under control . Hopefully , it will stay that way ... we'll see ....
