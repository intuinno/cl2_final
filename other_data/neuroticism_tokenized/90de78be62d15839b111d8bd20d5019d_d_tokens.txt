It's time we start paying attention to the little things that go unnoticed . 
THE SPARKS BAR TOUR ! <3 
Tons of photos , inappropriate writings on my arms in permanent marker , and a bottle of gatorade in my hand ... needless to say the Bar Tour was a huge success with a couple mistakes in judgement .

Dedicating this weekend to the grave dancers ... 
Why ask to sit at the same table with me at the library then proceed to invite a friend over and talk the whole time ? 
\Do you like to have an opinion ? \ " \ " Do you like to argue ? \ " Debate Club ? Yes . " 
The contents of my bag from camp that I just cleaned out tonight : 4 pairs of goggles , various < PROPMALE > projects , text rewrite to Don't Stop Believin ' , and of course 2 stamped four leaf clovers . I guess we were the lucky ones .

Downhill . 
Kids with special needs are just that . They only want what we want - to be accepted . Can I make a special request ? Is anyone willing to post this and leave it on their status for at least 1 hour ? It is Special Education week and this is in honor of all children made in a unique way !!

I've never been good with goodbyes 
I received one of the most touching letters ever today . I can't believe there is only one more day . :-( 
Deeeepressed on her last day . Like a moth to a flame ? Right ? No wait , that makes no sense . Like this . Okay , sorry you wasted your time reading it . 
Right now , to be perfectly honest , the general comment I got was , \ Ms. Jones pushed me to be the best I could be\ " and that is far more important than anything else " 
Day of actual production ? It seems wayyy difficult . 
Big summer decisions to make now . 
Do any education enthusiasts have any good professional development research books or articles that are a must read ? I need some new reading materials . 
And here I am , in my last hours as a college student ... 
I am a Penn State graduate ! 
\Why am I only on the outside of awesome still looking in ? \"" 
Movie trip tomorrow with the students and my other po friends ! :-)
