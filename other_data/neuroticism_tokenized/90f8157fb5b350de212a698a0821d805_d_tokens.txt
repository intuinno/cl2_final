i seek that which i cannot find .... relentesly i scoure the earth 

\If i have love only in my dreams ... then let me sleep forever \"" 
\the soul that can speak with its eyes can also kiss with a gaze \"" 
\for every beauty there is an eye somewhere to see it . For every truth there is an ear somewhere to hear it . For every love there is a heart somewhere to receive it \""
