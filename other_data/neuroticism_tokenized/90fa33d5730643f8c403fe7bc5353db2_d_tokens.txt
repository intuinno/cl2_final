tired of suffering from other people's mistakes . :'( 
did not want to go to school today . just an all around bad day . ugh . 
missin Jesssss . :( 
why do some people just look like they have a frown carved onto their faces ? 
God < PROPMALE > me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change ; courage to change the things I can ; and wisdom to know the difference . 
the class of 2014 ( which is lame , btw ) is really immature . show some respect freshman ! I don't care what anyone says , we were NOT like that as freshies . 
listening to my sister obsess over < PROPFIRST > Bieber , or however you spell her name . :) 
keep your face to the sunshine , and you can't see the shadows . (: 
work today ... whaaaa ? \ 
ugh .

\raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens ... \ " \ 
ms. miller has lost her mind . all this work . 
boys need to learn : saying sorry doesn't make everything better . in fact , girls need to learn that , too . 
Heaven help the fool who did her wrong\ 
It’s too late , too bad , she’s too far gone ;\ 
He should’ve thought of that before he left her all alone . \ 
If she’s lonely now , Lord , if she’s lonely now , \ 
If she’s lonely now , she won’t be lonely long .. 
Go on , cats , witcha bad selves . (: \ 
Black&gold , bby . :)

This . Right here . Is my . Swag . (:

Oh , yeah , that's right , I'm doin me ; I'm doin me .. (:

UK-bound (: 
wondering what's wrong with the world lately ... 
has taken a long enough hiatus from her poetry and short story . the muse is back . (: 
a woman's heart should be so lost in GOD that he should have to seek HIM to get to her . 
is being extra careful with her laptop in order to maintain connectivity . o_O 
love can sometimes be magic ; but magic can sometimes just be an illusion ... 
dear UK , \ 
bring me home . \ 
kthanks . 
not likin mid-shift crew , or mid-shift managers , mid-shift customers ... just don't like mid-shift . Ughhh . I miss Louisiana !!! 
hey cupid ;\

oh you're going to bed now ? wonderful status . changed my life . thanks for that .

your profile pic is a car ? sorry , didn't realize you were a transformer . \ 
night facebook . (: 
me at work : * giving a lady her change * have a good day ; your tiket number is 1497 . \

don't know why that song is stuck in my head . \ 
happy veteran's day . (: 
i suppose I'll play this \why what's up game . \ " \ 
nothin like < PROPFIRST > mraz , tacos , and forgotten homework on a nice half-day morning . :) 
whoever said < PROPMALE > year was your busiest year lied ; and evidently didn't have my schedule . 
Q&A ? (: 
Q : do you love me ? \ 
A : always means always , hun . 
any girl can look hot in a mini skirt and tank , but it takes an extra special girl to have that same effect in a hoodie and jeans . :) 
Q : why won't you give me a second chance ? \ 
A : because I'm not stupid . duh . 
Q : I miss the way we used to talk all the time . Do you think we've grown too far apart ? \

dear youth of America , \ 
there's a difference between \cloths\ " and \ " clothes 
times like this when I really miss those lady cats , and LHS in general . :) 
ugh , so many female hormones in this house . it's hard to keep up with who has what kind of attitude from day to day . at least when i'm ticked off , i don't take it out on other people . \ 
just sayin . 
it's funny to watch old people text . :) 
hope this day goes better .

but don't worry ; I sense a calculus test soon . see ya then ? :) 
am i the only one who hasn't watched \the game\ " ? haha . maybe I need to get on that and see what the hype is about . :) " 
dear LHS , \ 
i'm tired of seeing all these complaints about cold weather in louisiana on my news feed . \ 
especially when it's 19 degrees here , and our low is 14 . and it's only getting 4 degrees warmer . \ 
and on top of THAT , it's snowing . \ 
and on top of THAT , we still have school . \ 
so shut up ! :p \ 
thank you , that is all . 
freshmen make me sick . 
three day weekend . :) 
tulane , university of chicago , < PROPMALE > , and < PROPMALE > : leave me alone ! \ 
( well , < PROPMALE > , maybe for graduate school . ;]) \ 
but until then , back off ! 
family guy :) 
and that kind of stuff right there , is the stuff that makes us WANT to take < PROPFEMALE > from strangers . just to get away . \ 
church should help . 
whoa . i had a good day at work , for the first time in awhile . this is epic . 
it's cute when people try to rant and get smart via Facebook , and end up spelling all kinds of things wrong . :] \ 
at least make sure your cuss word is spelled correctly . \ 
work today . :] 
i understand you're from some distant , third world country . but for goodness sake . learn some English before you turn to Facebook . -_- 
STP TYP3N LYK3 THS . \ 
goodness . :) 
i swear the worst customers to have are old people . they just have a permanent frown engraved on their faces . 
i'm selfish , slightly vindictive , with a temper like a cobra . i can get into your head and twist your arm , and make you like it . i'm a woman , and I play these games ten times better . ;) 
kinda hopes it doesn't snow . 
la nieve , por favor . :) 
ever meet the one girl that's completely oblivious to the fact that no one likes her ? i have . someone should tell her . :] 
we young women , we're interesting creatures . :] 
hypocrites , you blow my mind sometimes . 
can tell it's gonna be one of those days where I'd rather be at school . 
beyond scared straight with my mommy ! :] 
waiting for my w-2 ... feel free to take your time , entrance road ! ugh . 
even the good things i do , i do wrong . /: \ 
ugh . night facebook . 
i haaaaaaaaaaaaaaate morning shift so much . makes me wanna change my availability . /: bleh . 
So that we may boldly say , The Lord is my helper , and I will not fear what man shall do unto me . -Hebrews 13:6 :) 
needs a hug . 
six years ago , God brought < PROPFEMALE > diabla into my life . haha . happy birthday , mi hermanita . yo te amo ... sometimes . :) 
know what's not cute ? \hey sexii\ " messages . \ 
¡defiéndame ! for once ?! 
mcdonalds shall be the death of me . >_< \ 
just tryin to get that scholarship . ugh . 
11-7 . that was a horrible shift to work . O_O 
dear lord , this half-time show is horrible . fergie sounds horrible , and those outfits are hideous . 
cute sweater , $20 . \ 
faded jeans with cut outs , $25 . \ 
brown boots with slick soles , $15 . \ 
falling off the bus and kicking the guy behind me in his jewels .... priceless . -__- epic . fail . 
do you REALLY have to update your Facebook every 16 minutes ? good lord , get a twitter . 
would like < PROPFEMALE > Pugh and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > to be my valentines ! :) 
Jes End , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , Tayler < PROPFIRST > , Raycheal Cook , < PROPFIRST > Smelcer , < PROPFIRST > Justb'real Isadore , & < PROPFIRST > Riley : I miss you . :)

some girls are such petty , jealous , insignificant little things . :) 
LHS . miss you . :) 
dear < PROPFIRST > bieber , \ 
< PROPFIRST > would like her voice back now . \ 
< PROPMALE > triton . \ 
hahaha :) 
work and school , school and work ; that's all I do . /: 
little sister : i like purple , because jbustin bieber likes purple too . \ 
me : just ' cause he likes it doesn't mean you have to .. \ 
jalyn : well I do like it ! i like pink , purple , white , and black . black goes with EVERYTHING . \ 
typical girl mindset . :) 
( almost ) everybody deserves a second < PROPMALE > . 
ONE class should not keep me busy all night . this teacher is off her nut . it's impossible to stay caught up . and I think every senior at HHS knows who it is . you are NOT my only class , what don't you understand ? 
it should be illegal to have to go to school on a day like today with such amazing sleeping weather . 
forreal ?? does she know who I am ? HA . smh at her . since when are the best and brightest at HHS patronized for having lives outside of school ? she must not know ; we AP kids make HHS . without us , you'd just be another high school . 
t.g.i.o. = thank god i'm off . :] 
this thirty minute crap is gonna put everybody on edge . i apologize in advance if i hurt your feelings today . :] 
doesn't feel like doing anything but sleeping until graduation . 
tell me , do I taste good ? because my name always seems to be in your mouth . \ 
silly girls . get on my level . 
hm . no english class today ? \ 
score . :) 
on break . /: finally !
