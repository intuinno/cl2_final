I really don't see why people think that driving and texting is okay . Some woman was texting and almost nailed the front of my car , all because she wasn't paying attention . \

Here's a fun fact : Driving on a cell phone or texting is that same as being intoxicated while driving . So imagine driving drunk with your kids in the backseat before you do it . Nothing is really that important that it can't wait till you stop . 
Well , quite a busy day . Good Night Facebook , all my friends and Family . ?
