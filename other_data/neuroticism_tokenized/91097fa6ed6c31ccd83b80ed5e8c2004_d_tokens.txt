Life . So unexpected . You never know what is going to happen next . But sometimes you get hints here and there . 
Here I am , Once again , Feeling lost but now and then , I breath it in . To let it go . And you don't know where you are now . You don't have to be afraid . To put your dream in action . Your never gonna fade . You'll be the main attraction Not a fantasy . Just remember me . When it turns out right :) Thats Make it Shine by < PROPFEMALE > Justice

A very very very sad day :( somethings i wish that would never happen , happened . When you say you miss someone do you miss the person or the way they used to act before all of this happened ? I fell both right now :( 
Need to find someone to go to the dance with ... :( 
Some friends are life long and some are just there to make an apperence . I know which one I am :'(

OMG !!! MY FAVORITE GOLFER WON HIS TOURNEMENT !!!! THIS IS THE GREATEST DAY EVVVEEERRRR !!!!!!!! HE IS AWESOME !!!!!! OMG I AM FREAKING OUT ABOUT THIS !!! I LOVE HIM !!!!! :) 
:( I really want to go to high school but the summer means 3 whole months without seeing the friends you dont < PROPFEMALE > out with outside of school . And you dont get to see the one you love everyday ( or anyday during the summer ) and your heart just aches all summer . Then you have to wonder what they remember of you , and if things got worse or better and what to do next . I really dont like summer because of that . 
Only got 5 hours of sleep last night ... It wasn't very fun for me ... I ended up sleeping in my parents bed because I was in so much pain ... I was like crying all night ... I would do anything for the pain to go away ... But I think I am okay now . Luckily .. 
Jazz band concert yesterday . I didnt get home until like 9:00 ! Wow a very loong weekend for me . Guess who finished their 8th grade project ? ME ! I am so happy . :) 
Everything is begining to make sense ... :) 
Sometimes you want something so much it seems like you never have it . Until its over and then you miss what you had and you know you can never have it again . 
Caught the flu last night ... Still sick today . :( My biggest fear haunted me all night . I'm not throwing up though ( not to jinx myself ) But I still feel really bad . :( 
Still a little sick . But I < PROPMALE > a lot better . Yes I will be at school tomorrow ... but idk about jazz band . I might not be up for it . But being it is the fin < PROPMALE > 2 days ... I will probably go and just sit there at the least . My fever has gone away but I'm still not that hungry ... 
Having been playing alto for 3 hours today . Playing \flight of the bumblebee\ " fun but difficult . I'm trying to get used to alto ( i havent played it in 3 years ) so i can be goood at the concert tomorrow night :) I have a good feeling :)))))) " 
High School Jazz Tryouts .... Sooo hard . We walked halfway to school today because we had no ride to get to the Middle School . Fun while it lasted . Need to talk to a person about important things . :) Nervous for both !!! 
A busy day today ! My facebook is being stupid i can like never log into it . Everyone needs to check out my favorite golfer ( < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Golf ) his facebook . He had a photoshoot ( cause he is also a model , oh yea :) ) He is so hot :) 
The field trip turned out being kinda fun today . I lost my earring in the lake when < PROPFEMALE > pulled out my earphone when we were on the dock . It was pretty amusing . 
Dance tomorrow :) Going to be so much fun ! Yearbooks made me so happy today :) Well .... mostly . I had SOME people write not as much as I would hope . Which is kind of disappointing . I can't wait for tomorrow . :) :) 
Dance was a lot of fun . < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , Marena and I looked so awesome ! I can't wait to see all of our pictures :) < PROPFEMALE > awesome . Graduation was pretty intersting . I totally wish i went to the beach today ... But I didn't :( oh well . I hope to see you guys soon . I miss all of you already . 
When you guys get your photo's from the photographer at the dance .... please tell me ! 
Just got back from golf lessons . I changed EVERYTHING about my swing . I learned that basicly everything that I thought i knew was wrong ... haha but I am like a lot better now . I feel really good about my swing . I can't wait to get healthy so I can play a round ! :)

When you want to do something so badly it hurts but you know you cant because it will alter your life in a way you dont know .... its very confusing on which path to take . 
I hate it when people think that they know everything and that they are always right and they think their life is perfect and that nothing and no one thinks bad of them and they havent changed at all no matter what you tell them . I hate people that do that and I wish that they werent so stupid and they would actually wake up and realize that they are horrible people . And they arent what they seem to be . 
Got my hair cut and Dyed !!! Lookes so awesome ! Check out all of the pages I liked in my info section ! So funnnnn . Going to the beach tomorrow to < PROPFEMALE > out with some pretty awesome people !!!

Sometimes life just sucks that way . D: :D 
Jazz band is so amazing :) 
September 26th is going to be amazing . Finley .. dont say a word ..

Sometimes life throws the weirdest things at you .... you just have to deal with it .... and imprivise and see what happens ..... 
NARNIA is the new name for gmail :) because its better in every way :) hahaha 
I hate the feeling when your so nervous to do something you get such a bad knot in your stomach you have to bend over . Then you cant do it ... god I have my stomach . 
I thought today was Tuesday ... I still think it is . Maybe I missed a day in my life . Yeah , thats it . :) 
Going to spend all day after school watching golf ! Such an awesome tournement :) My fav golfer < PROPFIRST > , is in 14th ! God thats just so awesome ! I cant wait .. I bet he is going to win :) Hahaha .

The days are cold livin’ without you\ 
The nights are long , I’m growing older\ 
I miss the days alone , thinkin’ about you\ 
You may be gone , but you’re never over\ 
And it don’t stop ( oh)\ 
And it don’t quit ( oh)\ 
And I miss you ( oh)\ 
I just miss you ( oh)\ 
Homie I’ll never forget you ( no)\ 
\Your never Over\ " \ 
My mom is going to leave and never come back ... My parents are getting devorced . :'( 
My mom said she talked to dad and she will stay . But i really dont know what the future will hold . Thank you to all of you who commented or sent me a message about my last message . It means a lot to me and i couldnt ever wish for better friends . I care about you all very much and if you ever need me I am here for you as well . 
Today was intersting . I wish i would have done some things differently . living with regrets really sucks . caught a bad cold last night as well . got it sucks so bad . D:

halloween was fun . im wondering how the day is going to go . everyone including me are going to be extremly tired .... D: 
me and < PROPFEMALE > watching saw . dr. gorden picks up a cell phone and says \im trying the police\ " then he call them and it doesnt work ... he tries again and still doesnt work ... < PROPFEMALE > says \ " wait then how does that chick call him later in the movie ? \ " then dr. gorden says : \ " this phone is meant to recieve calls not make them \"" 
People take life for granted . They dont realize what they truly have until they lose it , they dont know what they want until they dont have it anymore , and they wish for more and more things instead of enjoying the blessings that they have . Trust me on this one , i learned this one the hard way . So please , enjoy what you have and your friends . Because their is no one like you in the world and think about your future . 
Fall back this Saturday , cant wait for the extra sleep :) 
Truth is ... \like\ " and i will tell you :) "

< PROPFEMALE > comming over tonight :) Going to be awesome :) I cant wait to sleep in on thursday :) Hahahha going to make funny videos with < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > . :) hhaha i am in a good mood today . 
A dream is a wish that your heart makes when you fast asleep :) And some dreams come true ( da jha-fu for all of you who are wondering ) does that mean one of your wishes comes true ? And what do dreams tell you about yourself ? Their are so many things that we overlook in our lives such as this . My dreams tell me a lot about myself . I think about them all the time :) 
Northshore Jazz fest this Saturday :) Really nervous for my solo in Time After Time ... I hope I do well :) Wish our Jazz Band Luck !

Now I'm standing alone\ 
In a crowded room\ 
And we're not speaking\ 
And I'm dying to know\ 
Is it killing you\ 
Like it's killing me ? \ 
I don't know what to say\ 
Since a twist of fate\ 
When it all broke down\ 
And the story of us\ 
Looks a lot like a tragedy now 
The road is begining to split and im jumping back and forth on the paths ...
