\My pokemon brings all the nerds to the yard 
Random thought of the day : The military is trying to make exoskeletons so soldiers will do more \ 
with less energy but sady when they do finish making it . All that \ 
technology will go into letting a fat man move for the first time in \ 
there life . \ 
I got this idea while watching E3 on G4 . 
I find it funny how people can question the humanity of someone yet at the same time yell at the person for being a human by making one mistake . 
woot got l4d for free from < PROPFIRST > but D: i need nvidia geforce 6600 grahpics card or better on pc but i have nvidia geforce 5200 grahpics card on my pc ...... 
Hurray !!!! I just got a new toshiba satellite a665 labtop . now i can finally play good video games . :D 
just got battlefield bad company 2 for pc but i keep failing a lot at mutiplayer >.< 
aww onemanga.com is shutting down ...... hopefully mangafox won't shut down anytime soon 
The end of summer as I know it begins in 9 hours . Good bye summer , we had out laughs but alas its over and school must start . Thus begins another year of same friends , same enemies , and overall same routine . 
Sometimes I Just Want To Copy Someone Else’s Status , Word For Word , And See If They Notice 
wow there is like a rave or party like next door . people are clearly drunk over there . 
Even when I lose , I still somehow end up wining . 
Party across the street . Awesome music , but i can't sleep cuz of it at 3 a.m. 
WTF ? This is impossible !!! only 33% of my RAM is used up after i run a RAM clearing program , while over 70 tabs for firefox is running . 
I now have call of duty black ops . Time to start killing those monkeys . 
screwed up my < PROPMALE > but its ok life goes on . 
How far must we fall to lose our ability to enjoy laughter ?

YaY for 2 half days and 2 holidays this week !!! :D 
Played Reccettear : an item shop's tale today and realized a few things . 1 . little girls and housewives will always ask for less even if the price is 1 px . 2 . The bank is evil for tripling then quadrupling the < PROPFEMALE > fees each week . 3 . The banks are evil for putting a huge debt on a little girl ( main character of game ) . 
finally got a cell phone ...... feels like i sold my soul .... 
Here's a puzzle for you all . \ 
If you are an Engineer , you should be able to solve it within 3 minutes or less ( 30 seconds ); If you are an Architects , perhaps you will need 3 hours ; If you are a Doctor , perhaps you will need 6 hours ; If you are an Accountant , maybe 3 months ; If you are a Lawyer , maybe you can never find the answer . \
