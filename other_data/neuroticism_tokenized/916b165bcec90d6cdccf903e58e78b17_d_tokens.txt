just realized how awesome the av center is 
Conformar-se é submeter-se e vencer é conformar-se , ser vencido . Por isso toda a vitória é uma grosseria . Os vencedores perdem sempre todas as qualidades de desalento co o presente que os levaram à luta que lhes deu a vitória . Ficam satisfeitos , e satisfeito só pode estar aquele que se conforma , que não tem a mentalidade do vencedor . Vence só quem nunca consegue .
