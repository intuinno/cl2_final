I have decided that today is a perfect beach day =] 

lol I almost got blown away at the beach today ... 
realived that no shark came up and bit my leg off while snorkeling earlier ... hahaha ... 
hardly ever on the internet anymore so don't take it personally when I don't reply :) i'm busy jumping in waterfalls and other hippie things like that . 
Weather forecast for tonight : dark . 
my silence is my sound 
wants to take some lifeguard lessons so I can save the tourist :) 
beach bound 
soooo excited to be moving out on my own :) dogs included . 
I could use a dream or a < PROPFEMALE > or a wish ... 
Yawning is contagious - even thinking about yawning is enough . After reading this fact , there is a 50% < PROPMALE > you will yawn . 
Can a person choke and die on a life saver ? 
beach bound ! 
Absence diminishes mediocre passions and increases great ones , as the wind extinguishes candles and fans fires . 
whoever decides to burn the sugar cane on a non < PROPFEMALE > day is a big A-hole . 
you can turn off the sun , but i'm still gonna shine :) 
testing out my green thumb ... 
well aren't you a breath of fresh air :) 
There's ah storm ah brewin ' in D horizon ! Let D rain begin ! 
The time I kill is killing me . 
down by the seashore , where life is a little easier :) 
Today has been a great day . First I tanned my white ass n while doing so got a call saying I can start moving stuff into my new house whenever and then I found out i'm going to be an aunty ! whoo !!! :D 
Found out what I want for christmas ! A nice ass camera so I can take some badass pictures ! Anyone got suggestions on one I should get ? 
Party down , boogy down time ! Then first night sleeping in my new place :)
