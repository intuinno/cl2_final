Thanks to everyone who wished me a Happy Birthday via various mediums ! I had an amazing day , and now I'm exhausted , but in a good way :) 

So , i learned my lesson . I had a bunch of stuff stolen out of the back of my truck when I was moving . Mostly clothes and all of my better pottery from my ceramics class . I've filed a police report , but most likely my hard work in ceramics will be thrown o 
I'm officially a college graduate ! Yay !!!! 
A pastry chef !! Awesome !!! :D My degree is in English Literature haha How is life abroad ? Do you plan on staying there when you're done with school ? 
ooo i'm a dunce . That was for < PROPFEMALE > haha 
I want a Bengal < PROPFEMALE > !! 
is going to have a busy day . I'll be out in LA for a while picking up pre-reg tickets for AX 09 !! :D Gotta finish my costume today too >> << 
is so tired from 3 days of Anime Expo that she isn't sure she'll be going to Day 4 
I've got shingles from lack of sleep and a compromised immune system . Trust me to get the weird diseases lol 
I can't wait for HP6 tomorrow !!! :D 
woot ! < PROPMALE > Potter midnight premiere !!! I'm at the Ontario Mills Edwards Imax theater if anyone wants to join < PROPMALE > and I there :) 
< PROPMALE > Potter was awesome !!! As always :D

i wonder how I managed to get an English Literature degree without having read any < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > novels lol 
wants to read Beowulf again . Now , if only I could find one of the copies I have ..... 
watching corny movies while i clean my closet to make room for professional looking clothes lol . 
ack . I need something to do !!! I'm bored !!! 
school needs to hurry up and start ! I'm going crazy !!! 
just finished the book i bought last night . Why do I always read so damn fast if I'm enjoying the book ??? 
making an attempt at knitting a hat . Haven't attempted that in years lol . Hey < PROPFIRST > , if I fail , can I send you the yarn and commission a hat ? lol 
just bitched out someone in the graduate admissions office . It's taken 6 months to process and accept my application . And I still can't register . If I'm not able to register tomorrow morning like I'm supposed to , heads will roll . 
any of you science-y types know how to make a bomb ? I feel the need to blow my school to smithereens 
working the PM shift tomorrow . Need sleep . TTYL peoples ! <3 Night 
saw a little kid today that totally looked like one of the troll dolls from the 90s . Pretty sad , really . 
bored bored bored . Isn't it sad that I want to go back to school ? And what's even worse is that I know that when I get back to school , I'll most likely hate it ... grrrr . 
should be cleaning her craft supply cluttered room but is playing on here instead lol 
so freakin happy ! I'm talking to friends I haven't talked to in years !!! 
night everyone !!! 
$550 for stupid textbooks . < gasps , dies , returns as a zombie to munch the horrible greedy textbook barons > 
i'm actually somewhat motivated to eating healthier and losing some weight 
packing for Anime Vegas . I almost couldn't find my bra for my costume . That would have been a < PROPMALE > disaster lol 
ugh . I'm tired . Need to go to bed early tonight lol 
I don't know why life has to be such a pain in my ass . I swear almost everone is out to drag deeper into my personal hell . 
School is stupid , oh so stupid ! I wish people would stop taking vacations without getting the necessary paperwork for the next quarter done first . 1st it was that I hadn't been accepted to the credential program because my program administrator was out of town . Now it's that the placement advisor at Chaffey District didn't place people before taking a vacation . Why are people so damn stupid and inconsiderate ??? 
blah . Its too hot in my room to sleep . I think it is another sleepless night for me . 
ugh !!!!! I forgot to but some more parts for the Christmas presents i'm working on . Now I have to postpone my work :( How annoying !! 
my friend < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > is engaged !!! Gosh , everyone is either getting married or having kids . Scary ! lol 
some how my dumb ass Siamese found his way out of the house ( most likely Dad left a door open ) . 20 minutes later I find him in my neighbor's backyard exploring . I got my neighbor to go in his backyard and scare Teemu out of it . Mu sprinted back home and is now huddled in a corner , quivering from his stupidity . 
i want to start working out , but its so hot ..... maybe i'll jump in the pool and do some laps in a little bit 
I just managed to piss off my mom when she's half a world a way . Apparently I'm not allowed to have a life outside my parents and school , not matter that I'm 22 , have a boyfriend and a BA . Wonderful . 
I think Muse's \Knights of Cydonia\ " is one of the oddest music videos I have ever seen . Ever . " 
hmm , My Chemical Romance's \Black Parade\ " is another really weird one haha . " 
i was so hot after all my cleaning and outside chores that I literally took an ice cold shower . I don't ever ever remember doing that before lol 
I'm bored . I want to do something . 
I'm at school sitting in my classroom over an hour before class starts . Am I a dork or what ? lol 
omg i have Miley < PROPMALE > stuck in my head !!!! * hums \Party in the USA \"* How can I go to sleep with that in my head ???? lol " 
anyone know where I can buy an inexpensive lightbox ? 
i feel so out of place . Maybe I'm not supposed to be a teacher ? 
I've changed my mind . I hate credential school . And I'm only on day 4 . Grrr . Is it too late to get a refund and start my MLIS ? 
needs an entirely new brain . Anyone know where I can find one ? 
ack it's hot !!! :( 
I already feel drained and Week 2 hasn't even started * cries * 
can't wait to see her headshots !! Now she just has to get through the grueling credential program >.< 
grrr , someone want to do my homework for me ? 
what's really sad is that I think the 2nd Twilight movie might actually be good , but I don't have anyone to see it with haha 
my fat a ** needs to lose weight . I should start boycotting food lol 
I want to see my headshots so bad !!!! < PROPFIRST > is a great photographer and I'm really looking forward to the \librarian\ " set we took ! LOL ! " 
eeks !! I need to write a resume lol . This is going to suck . 
i want to go back to my high school and teach sewing . I want to take over Mrs. Solano's job haha . Librarian and sewing teacher !!!! 
anyone know if there is a really easy way to make seating charts ? I'm doing a really crappy job haha ( it has to be on a computer :( ) 
woot !!! I did my seating chart thingy , now I have to write my rationale on it . Then I can move onto fieldwork #2 , which is teacher movement , and my resident teacher doesn't like to move around alot .... and I have to write a rationale for that one too ..... but I should probably finish my concept map for educational psychology ' cause that's due tomorrow ..... 
my headshots are up !!!!! :D 
i'm dying of boredom in class . someone save me ! lol 
you know what sucks ? I'm working on Halloween , and I'll probably be doing homework afterwards . What a crappy life I lead . :( 
i love halloween cards !! Off to get my hair cut now ! :D Don't worry , I'm not chopping it off again :D 
Mommy's making pumpkin rocks !!! ** squeee !!!! **

I'm determined to do a little bit of homework and a lot of sewing :) I have to get Christmas presents made !!!! 
killing time until I go to my high school . Then I have homework to do before my 6pm class :) 
my room is a disaster zone !! I can't wait until Christmas present sewing is over so I can do a really thorough cleaning lol

Dad set off the smoke alarm by drilling into the granite counter in the kitchen . Mom's all pissed now and the nice clean floors and counters are insanely dirty . We have to clean the entire house tomorrow because we aren't allowed to mop or get the counters wet- because we just got the floors and counters resealed ..... oh the joys of living at home .
