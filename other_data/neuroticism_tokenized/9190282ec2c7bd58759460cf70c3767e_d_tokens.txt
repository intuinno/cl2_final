I'm in Oklahoma ........ 

< PROPFIRST > wants me to tell people that he's my brother and our daddy is our uncle !! 
I saw < PROPMALE > Potter !!! It was pretty good . It was the first of the series that was different from the books !! Still good , but you can notice the changes if you've read the books !! All in all , fabulous !!! 
Sometimes people just suck , and I guess we have to learn to live amongst those who are perpetually crap ! Sometimes , I think that McAlester , OK has more of the perpetually shitty than elsewhere ! I just don't know how long I can survive here !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Hi .......... I'm < PROPFEMALE > . 
Oh my ....... ( any God , who you may believe in ) WTF , is wrong with this state ............... seriously people , Oklahoma needs to be it's own nation ............. this place is soooooo primitive , it's unreal ............ We need to vote to make OK go away ....... 
Really , not to harass or anything , but how is it that everyone is on food stamps ?? The majority of the people here have no teeth and they buy sodas and < PROPFEMALE > with their food stamps ( saw it first hand today ... simply sodas and < PROPFEMALE > ) it's very frustrating f 
I hate this state more than anything in the world , this simply isn't right . We can't even afford to give our very well mannered and educationally advanced daughter a treat . But all these people on food stamps can give their children as much as they wish , 
Why is it that people can buy sodas , < PROPFEMALE > , and other non-nutritional items on food stamps ? Please , if you're an American , write Congress AND Senate . My husband works so hard to provide for us and we're barely breaking even because of all these thieves w 
Sometimes I worry about people .......... 
How is it that my husband is so amazing ? Honestly , he's the most amazing person I've ever met !!! I love you < PROPFIRST > , more than you can possibly know !!! 
I just saw a dog chained up with no food or water , ( while I got it some food and water , ) what is the matter with people ??? I really think these people should suffer the same fate as if they did it to a child . My reasoning is : they keep the dog on a chain , it cannot fend for itself !!! This place is crazy . What kind of human being treats an animal with such disrespect ??? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRrGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHH 
hmmmmmmmmm ........ 
I really think that I love my < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > far more than any human should ever love an animal ............ 
My dog just woke me up to go outside only to stand and stare ............... why would she do that .......... I'll never get back to sleep ......... regardless , I love her , so I guess it's okay !!! 
We finally moved , we're now with normal people .... the apartment is awesome .......... 
I finally got a job , my boss rocks and he's going to literally pay me for my work . I'm working for a grassroots campaign in the effort to clean up McAlester While McAlester may be beautiful ...... they're a lot of improvements to be made . Regardless , I'm super excited and honored to be accepted for this position !! 
My dog thinks she's a cat and my cat thinks she's a dog . 
Going to work .......... I really like my new job ! 
I am pregnant ! Pregnant , pregnant , pregnant ! 
And my dog farts ......... 
Why am I getting a Master's again ?? Tired ! 
I miss my < PROPFIRST > ! A day and a half is too long ! < PROPFIRST > Haddock 
Remeber , all graduate level papers require at least 3 references .............. I hope a donkey craps in her mouth ! I do NOT care for this professor !!! 
Why do people complain when they are offered a free service ? I don't get it ! 
I'm really going with < PROPFEMALE > for a girl ............. just love it ! 
My boss just gave me a website to go to written , \ACCU Weather < PROPFEMALE > com ! \ " He really needs computer classes ! " 
Work .......... blah ! 
Warm and toasty by the fireplace ...... far too cold outside ! 
I don't care for group assignments much ......... especially when I get stuck doing the work of 4 people ......... either that or get a bad grade :{ 
I had no morning sickness at all this pregnancy . Just a few days ago I started getting sick in the evenings .......... yuck ! The first trimester is almost finished ......... hopefully the vomiting is no more soon ! 
My baby bump keeps getting bigger then smaller ......... maybe no pop yet ? 
Poor < PROPFIRST > and Kenzi are sick ! It looks like the flu but they both had seasonal flu shots . Kenzi also had the H1N1 vaccine and she was the first one to get sick ........... why ???? I feel so sorry for them :( 
This morning as I was walking my dog in the middle of my apartment complex ( in the middle of the city ) I was almost plowed by a damn cow ! Then as I was looking for my cow I found half an arm in someone's yard ( it was fake but that's not obvious when you're 100 feet from it ) . Not cool !!! The cops eventually found the cow in someone's driveway . 
Finally finished ....... eating then sleeping !! 
Only 9 more classes until I have a Master's Degree .............. if I make it ......... talk about a booty whoopin ' 
Please vote : Which name do you like best ? Girl : < PROPFEMALE > - Poppy < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > - < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > - Maddy < PROPFIRST > - Lexi Boy : < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > 
Cold ....... and rainy 
Just read Teen Vogue so I can discuss its role in child development ................. blah . Oh and it's embarrassing buying a teenage magazine when you're 27 ........ 
I HAVE to write this darn paper ........ 
So we're playing Uno and I notice < PROPFIRST > slowly moving towards the discard deck with a guilty smirk on his face . He tried to play a stack of 20 cards in one turn ............ too bad he isn't that slick ! BUSTED !!! 
I felt my bambino moving !!!! 
I want some hummus !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
It's a boy !! 
Having a glass of wine , already in my pjs , and wondering how I'll manage to stay awake until midnight . Happy New Year ! 
I made it ...... now time to crash ! 
Congrats to Nate and < PROPFEMALE > ! We're so happy for you two ... maybe we'll be able to go to the American edition ! We miss y'all ( this is from < PROPFIRST > too ... ha ! ) . 
We're naming the baby Bentlee !! I'm so happy and relieved we've finally agreed on a name !!!!! 
I'm so ready to meet my little man ! We finally bought his swing and bassinet . I've bought him so many little outfits - I love looking at all his < PROPFEMALE > clothes ! We're waiting to get our assignment to buy his furniture and still researching carseats . 
I had a rough day today , just not feeling well ( aches and pains and emotional issues ) . < PROPFIRST > made me feel so much better ! He's just so sweet that I forgot my back/hip/head aches . I LOVE my husband !! Thank you , < PROPFIRST > ! 
We're moving to < PROPFEMALE > in June !!!!! 
I had a long day at work , but came home to my beautiful family , a red < PROPFEMALE > , and two sweet cards from < PROPFIRST > and Kenzi . It's no fun having a late meeting ........ but my amazing family made up for it ! 
Third trimester morning sickness ???????????????? Not fair ! 
So , we named our baby boy Bentlee ................ now I've found another name I REALLY like and < PROPFIRST > prefers it too . I don't know if it's too late to change or if we should stick with Bentlee . The new name is ....... Presley . 
Today was my last day at work ! Now I'm just gonna be big , unemployed , pregnant woman ! Woohoo !!! 
My baby girl is 8 !!! 
My day gets better as soon as < PROPFEMALE > comes on !! 
PSA : There is absolutely no reason to inform a pregnant woman of her current condition . It is also VERY rude to comment on how HUGE she is - this is especially true when you are larger than she is and NOT pregnant . The best idea is to keep your trap shut ! Thank you . 
We have a baby boy !!!! 
had Bentlee's newborn photos taken this morning ......... he peed and spit up on the set ! Very cute pictures ! 
I have the most amazing husband . He's super supportive ! He should get an award for daddy of the century ! I love you , < PROPFIRST > !! 
Kenzi is in Tulsa on a field trip . It's the first I haven't been on . I can't wait until 4 so I can have some peace of mind . Two hours is a bit far for a 2nd grade field trip . 
I feel like < PROPFEMALE > the cow . 
So ... Bentlee's nursing , looks at me through the corner of his eye , and gives me an ear to ear smile !! Made my day . 
Bentlee is a month old today !!! 
Bentlee sounds like a vicious animal when it's time to nurse and he's getting close . Then he turns into a sweet baby boy once he gets his milk . Babies make some crazy noises .... I'd forgotten . 
So at 6:30 this morning I gave up trying to go back to sleep . Bentlee was cranky . I got out of bed and put the little bean in his swing for a minute to get a couple of things done and he falls asleep ........ nice . 
Bentlee's tummy is upset . I wonder if I ate something he doesn't agree with ....... but I don't remember what I ate yesterday .... I eat too much . It's horrible to think I've upset his little tummy ..... poor guy :( 
We're getting packed out on Wednesday !!! Heading for < PROPFEMALE > in 8 days !!! 
Goodbye Oklahoma !! 
We went to DC today ! Tiring and fun !! 
we've finally found a house !!!!!! 
I just paid $50 for nasonex and I feel like I got a good deal ..... sad . 
I am NOT happy ! Hopefully this changes soon . 
Well ........ no movers today . < PROPFIRST > said they are going to come Wednesday . I'm still not happy ......... but I am MUCH happier than before ! 
Our downstairs looks and feels like home !! Now we need to tackle upstairs .......... 
spent the day in DC ..... heading home !!! 
I love my hubby !!! 
Miss Makenzi is so funny ! She literally begs us to change Bentlee's diaper ( which we rarely do) ! 
taking Bentlee to the library for storytime .... I hope he likes it ( his sister sure does) ! 
my baby boy is 4 months old today !!!! Time flies ..... 
I'm going to throw my phone off a bridge ! It not only randomly calls people at ALL hours ( sorry Erica ) ..... but now it has decided to randomly like everyone's FB status !!! 
Seven years ago today I married my amazing husband !!! I love you , < PROPFIRST > !! 
< PROPFIRST > and I just got home from a date !!! An actual date ....... no kids ( imagine that) ! It was so fabulous !! He is so amazing ! I'm so thankful that he's my husband AND the father to my children !! < PROPFIRST > , you rock !! 
I do not feel well today ! busy 
Tomorrow is Kenzi's first day of third grade ...... wow ! They don't require any school supplies ( I spent $1.60 on a pencil box and pencils ) AND school doesn't start until 9 am . Another reason to love < PROPFEMALE > !!!! 
My baby boy is 5 months old today . Sometimes I wish I could stop time for a bit ........ it's going by too fast !!!! 
Orange is an awful color ....... especially when it's burnt !!!! 
just loves when her baby boy decides to start the day at 0530 ........ 
Kenzi threw up at swim practice and held in her mouth until I got to her and pulled her out of the pool ..... if I were the one swimming there would have been vomit in the pool ! 
what is the matter with people ??? 
it just won't stop raining ....... 
it is cold !!! 
about to take Bentlee to get his 6 month shots .......... NOT excited . 
Thanks for the birthday wishes everyone ! So sweet ! I'm getting the best bday gift this evening ...... I get to watch my baby girl swim in her first meet ! She's going to rock it !!! 
super sleepy ! Kenzi has another swim meet this morning ! She's so excited ! 
finally got a job !! 
So I just looked at my activities and it said ' breastfeeding in public ' ........ yeah , I don't do that for fun or anything , just when necessary ..... why did it even say that ? 
Kenzi placed second in the backstroke ! 
tired ...... 
going to Baltimore in a few hours to pick up < PROPFIRST > ! I can't wait to see him !! 
my poor baby girl spilt soup on her leg last night . We took her to the ER . It looks like everything will be fine , but it was a pretty nasty burn ( 2nd degree ) . I've got to clean and redress it this morning .......... I hope it looks and feels better , but something tells me it won't . On a bright note , the ER in Chambersburg is FABULOUS ! Everyone was super nice and we were in and out in an hour ! 
< PROPFIRST > thought Bentlee might be constipated ......... so he proceeds to feed him an entire jar of prunes . Mom and I agreed that < PROPFIRST > is on diaper duty for the next 24 hours !! Good luck , husband !! 
My kiddos make me so happy ! 
Kenzi got first in 50 free ! 
Cleaning days are the days I miss having a < PROPFEMALE > apartment . 
Bentlee is getting his two front teeth for Christmas ! They popped through this morning ! 
Bentlee finally decided to start crawling ! 
It's snowing ... a lot !!! I think I'm about to learn a little about < PROPFEMALE>'s winters . 
Bentlee woke up about 80 times last night ! < PROPFIRST > and I are patiently waiting for him to sleep through the night , maybe when he's 30 .... who knows at this point ! Kenzi has a swim meet in Lancaster today . Warm up starts at 3 ... so we should get home sometime in the middle of the night , blah . 
Well , we're not going to Lancaster anymore . It's supposed to snow again . 
When I get numerous emails for a law school asking me to apply it sends up some pretty big red flags ... are these seats supposed to be coveted or something ? 
My mom tricked me ... she asked me to go to Wal-Mart ... I reluctantly agreed .. now Bentlee and I are patiently waiting for her outside of some damn thrift store ! 
So , I made Kenzi clean her bathroom this afternoon . We had an interesting dialogue ... \ 
Kenzi : \Mommy 
It is COLD !!! 
This weather is NASTY ! I want < PROPFIRST > to come home ! 
We have so much snow and it's snowing again . I think we'll be buried soon ..... I'm ready for summer ! 
I put Bentlee to bed ( in his crib ) at 8 last night - he slept until 7:30 this morning ! Awesome ! Last night was the first time in almost ten months that my boobs were off duty ! Progress ...
