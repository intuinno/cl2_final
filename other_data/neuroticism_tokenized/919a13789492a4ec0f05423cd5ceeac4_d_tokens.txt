Cops who panic Kill ! A CHP officer killed his family ' cuz he didn't know what to do to a runaway car ! Put car in neutral , reverse , or just turn off your damn engine ! I was @ the scene of the accident , pure sadness for this family & intense contempt for this cop ! Like those mothers who get stuck on railroads , instead of pulling the kids/themselves out , they stay and try to move the car until the train hits ... stupid . 
in spite of everything I still believe that people are really good at heart . Meditate :]

to Tiger's judges and assessors of his marriage-whether dishonest or for $$ [ it may have been for her genes ! ] pls StfU . YOU don't KNOW Tiger ! u just know that he's the best golfer , has lots of money and women throwing themselves @ him . He doesn't owe us any apology , just because we buy Tag Heuer or Nike . but if it makes you forget your own problems cuz Tiger has bigger ones , well , misery loves company ! 
a toast to higher taxes and the loss of our personal freedom ; the decline of patient care ; explosion of malpractice lawsuits and gov't corruption ; and more spending cuts on our education ! 
Happy 9th Birthday < PROPFEMALE > !!!

... the gods have called him . \ by R.S. So are the gods jealous ? Speaking of a man's success ... A successful man is one who makes more money than his wife can spend . A successful woman is one who can find such a man . LT " 
< PROPMALE > danced the Zapateado during a Cinco de Mayo festivities , he was the lead male and the only Asian in his Spanish dance troupe ! I saw and heard the Hispanic audience goin WTH ! 
< PROPMALE > dropped another shock on me again which momentarily had negative valence effect [ my bad ] ... He competed in an essay and public speaking competition in his school's YMCA and won ! He's off to rep his school to compete citywide with other SD Unified schools ' winners . He and < PROPFEMALE > don't need my push . Mad < PROPMALE > are fearless and go-getters ! 
Memorial wkend isn't complete w/out a trip to the ER [ Monday night ] ... Beckham is on his second broken bone and ortho cast-fractured elbow from slipping off a fallen Sequoia . He wants a purple cast this time .

Vacation , all i ever wanted ... :] 
While shopping today , a woman called out the name Beckham , Nap & I wondered who she was calling . She was calling her kid ! He was younger , hence my Beck was first . I wonder if Beck or I'd ever meet a Zenadine , Knightley , or Cross . 
MadMax is happy Deutschland is still standing ! I wonder if they even rooted for USA . dual loyalty ? 
Saw Toy Story 3 and I didn't cry in the end , passed up Eclipse [ kids protested , \That's for DVD watching only ! \ " ] watched Grown Ups instead and laughed the whole time ! " 
OMG , I think last night's fireworks all over SD [ 4 going off @ the same time ] were the longest ever . after 10mins , we wanted it to stop already to beat traffic !

Saddened that < PROPMALE>'s not thinking about grad school for now , instead he's doing environmental research in Port < PROPFEMALE > , South Africa then a stop in Amsterdam for his 21st b-day . Aiming for < PROPMALE > U . for grad school ! 
I respect SMART control freaks , but STUPID ones , who delegate their duties to another dummy , is just an obvious display of weakness ... it's something a smart cf , with plenty of time to spare can exploit , along with the frailty of this dumb person's [ very poor ] memory . :] 
Beck was close to having his head shaved cuz of gum stuck close to his scalp ! \ 
mommies , before u resort to that , 1/2 cup of < PROPFEMALE > oil is all it takes :] 
After almost 3 mos of job absence , I dread going back tomorrow .

not a very good way to start the evening ... Niki twisted ankle skateboarding [ fracture TBD tomorrow ] , < PROPFEMALE > and Beckham tossing their cookies in school and home . and < PROPMALE > is happy cuz he's not on BRAT diet . 
You can take the girl out of The City but you cant take The City out of the girl . Go Misfits ! 
in my 8 yrs in SD , I've experienced enough rainfalls , and i'm sure San Diegans and some Socal area folks have seen plenty , so why haven't they learned how to drive in the rain ? oh the ineptness ! SOCAL freeway drivers : do not use cruise control during rain and don't brake too hard when u hit a puddle ! hydroplaning , learn it . 
after yrs of reassuring my < PROPFEMALE > that it is a BOY's name , when Mad-Bum made MLB debut in 09 , and now an SP for the NLCS he's finally proud ...

They said no under 6 for The Lion < PROPMALE > ; Beck went @ 3 y/o and behaved well . we'll see about that for Shrek , Rain , Mamma Mia , Beauty and Beast [ @the Pantages ] . I couldn't leave him out of Broadway musical season tix , while MadMax have theirs . 
Happy 21st B-day to the most stoic , resilient , strong young man , N . Christian Arias III . Some of you have witnessed the 2nd week of his life and attended his grand christening @ The Waterfront on Pier 7 . Lived on 3 continents [ NA , EU , AFR ] , globetrotting @ the age of 3 and still a wanderlust , celebrating his 21st in Capetown South Africa and finishing it off in Amsterdam ... We & hearts ; you !

I love Apple , but can Verizon and ATT w/ their Iphones do that ? Soon , soon , a GSM-compatible Iphone for T-mobile ...!
