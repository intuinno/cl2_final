Question : How do you say no to someone who has never actually asked ? {: [ 

After like thousands of times of try , Bank of < PROPFEMALE > website is still down , so -- miserable ~ 
Endless grading jobs : Q 
A literally ' bloody ' day :( 
That little trick with soda really worked : it's the tenderest beef I've ever had , and my apron looks new again^^ ~ 
Is there still enough time for a plan A ? 
Test week , busy schedule , definitely no time for \the\ " plan now :( " 
Surprisingly , a walking shadow is able to feel pain ; turns out the only thing that can last forever is torment ~ 
Hoping against hope that \????????\"~ Two much rain these days ~ " 
The wireless is off again :( 
Happy Chinese lunar new year ! Watch out : the \tigers\ " are coming ~ " 
Wireless- off , cellphone- broken ; brain- power off , nerves- broken down ~ 
Watching Kenzou running is so soothing & inspiring ~ 
Is < PROPFIRST > a perfect name for poets , or is it just a popular name ? 
Those kids are driving me crazy :O 
Fish and ribs- my big lunch on Lantern Festival ~ Happy holiday^@^ 
is exhausted , and coffee didn't work at all =( How can one be both tired & insomnious at the same time ? Well , I hope spicy food will work , but it got to be VERY spicy ~ 
Spring break begins , and this place seems so ... uninhabited :( Isn't there anyone else gonna be around here during spring break ? 
got to stop storing up food , the freezer is too stuffed ~ 
Making my specialty : honeydew shellfish chicken soup , smells so good ~ just seems too much for one :( 
trying to be alive again ~ 
Braised ribs for lunch : it's too hard be vegetarian , while eating meat is so satisfying ~ 
Lunch Mar . 18 : fried dumplings , the flour paste might be a little too much , but ... yummy ~ 
Strawberry milkshake & chocolate cream pie , trying to make this bitter life a little sweeter ~ ? it's weird the milkshake made from real strawberry is actually purple -- | ? 
A little scared , is it too much ? 
sick , again ? 
want to go shopping ~ 
came back from shopping : cloths and food , it's all i need^^ ~ 
run out of strawberries , so just enjoy the last glass of strawberry milkshake this year ~ 
??????????? 
back from the depression , trying to catch up the study ~ 
got a tan^^ ~ 
need to make that voice stop ): { 
is fighting with her weakness ~ the clouds(cumulus ? ) today r so beautiful :o 
What a beautiful day ~ It's like the weather of a summer vacation ~ wish to be 7 again , so that I could climb the tree & walk on the wall , or just ride the bike in the backyard before it accidentally hit into the trash bin :P 
' s triceps r aching from hitting the gigantic ball :P now enough fun stuff , it's time to go back to the serious things : HW assignmentS , preparing for the presentation & study for the final ~ :( 
It's hard enough to believe that there is someone who could actually be more irresponsible then I am , and it's even hard to imagine someone could just ruin other people's lives and doesn't even care ! Like a unscrupulous quack who keeps killing his patients , or a professor in whose class students learned absolutely nothing ~ 
waiting & learn from it ~ 
Just had the most vivid & detailed dream , does dream always mean something ? Head aching now , must wake up ! 
want to lie down on the candyfloss-like clouds floating on the blue sky , what would that feels like ? 
done with the tests , now buried alive by the grading job :( 
finish 1 grading , after almost 10 hours , feel sick , & starving ~ 
So happy :D 
Lunch May 11th : braised beef oxtail ( though I heard they are best for soup) ~ \ 
Haven't been cooking for so long , tastes like I still get it :P 
So , it's been 3 years already :| 
got bitten by some unidentified bug :[ 
waiting for the stuffed tomato getting steamed :P 
trying to find out those invisible bugs ~ \ 
dying from the itch :( 
fighting with the fleas ~ \ 
you may drive me out of my apartment now , but when I come back 2 hours later , you will all be gone , forever ~ :O 
cooking for 1 hour & then eating all the dishes alone is so miserable :( \ 
\ 
so I'm going to try out some new recipes , \ 
anyone need lunch service this summer ? 
so tired , still don't want to go to bed ~ 
getting baptized tomorrow ^^ 
still , feel useless :( 
> < ' 
so bored :{ there's never enough movies ~ 
trying to find something meaningful to do this summer ~ 
went to bed before midnight the first time in 2 weeks , \ 
1 hour later , still wide awake > < ' 
so embarrassed > < 
' s locked herself out again ~ \ 
so I guess too much sleep does make u dumb just like lack of sleep -- | 
just had a great movie night , n came home find the internet is working again :D 
suffered from the insomnia , again ! : Q\ 
rly should start doing yoga : clear the mind , clear the mind !!!!!!!! 
so here's the only thing not so good about the summer- no late nite ~ what to do on Sunday night then :[ 
alright , Monday's coming , time to start doing things more than just watching movies ~ 
gonna find some class to attend this summer ~ 
seriously , I need some treatment for insomnia :O 
sleeping is such a waste of time ~ 
has got the magic pills , time to do some real working out ~ 
how comes the grading work so hard to get used to ? =( 
I know it's not right to stay in the comfort zone only , but if there's no good enough reason , I'd rather spend time with the people I actually like , even it means I have to sit there for 2 hours watching a extremely boring movie ~ 
so I've had an awesome Friday night n a great Sunday morning , I guess it's fair enough to have a miserable Sunday night , it's just balanced my weekend ~ 
Here comes the \sour blueberry\ " - just found out I lost my sweetest little purple with lace umbrella =( \ 
so I had popcorn for dinner anyway ^^ ~ 
Could there be anything more beautiful than music in this world ? \ 
I can just stay up all night long like this =) 
it's so great to be able to calm my soul and enjoy the time spent alone again , finally ~ 
loves blueberries !!! 
got tan & sunburned , so weird :P 
my skin's usually icy in summer , but now it's actually burning , OOOOOOUCH ~~~ \ 
but spent whole day on the beach- totally worth it !!!!!!!!! \ 
so the SPF 75 + didn't work , maybe I should just try the SPF95+ , plus ultra-waterproof next time =/ 
petrified ++ ~~~~ \ 
it's so eerie ~~~~~~~~~ \ 
what kind of director could make my fav classic into such a creepy horror ~~~~~ \ 
It's even more scaring than watch the ring > < ~~~~~~ 
so I tried , it's almost 6 o'clock in the morning , but I'm still wide awake ++\ 
am I really keeping that much things on mind ? 
nearly done with the grading , \ 
seriously lack of sleep , rly sld take a nap now ~ \ 
Then probably sld start packing , \ 
just hoping there's another way to get there , traveling by plane freaks me out , EVERY TIME ! \ 
but it's great to stop being the only one in the house ~ \ 
Everything seems fine , though I have to wait a month to get a new cell num that can get text : such an inconvenience , \ 
but , it could make a great summer ~ 
so this is what it feels- living in countryside : extremely serenity ~ \ 
it's all great , except I got back the 4 pounds lost by keeping starved for a whole week back in one day :( I'm gonna get fat after the three weeks :[ 
it's almost as cold as winter here :/ 
loves BBQ !!! \ 
n cherries & berries & CHEESECAKE ^@^ 
ribs , lamb , shrimp , chicken , vegetables ~ \ 
that's what we called BBQ ^^ 
back to Tampa tomorrow ~ \ 
I sure will miss the weather here : @ 
it's so great to be back ~ \ 
still feel a little lost : I guess that's the dark side of vacations- when it ends , you have to leave ~ 
got my new bed at 7 o'clock in the morning **\ 
those delivery people really are early birds ~ \ 
go back to sleep now ~ 
rearranged the furniture , \ 
it helped a little ~ 
is so hyper & dancing in front of the mirrors in her room now :P \ 
( I blame the caffeine , but it kindda felt great after the depressing stage ) 
missing ... so much :( 
WHY DO I KEEP LOSING STUFF ? \ 
AM I GETTING DUMB :( \ 
IS THAT TRUE THOSE FOOD R CONTAMINATED ? = Q 
just had a dream about having a dream & then passing out at a eerie night = Q 
definitely gonna get one of those huge trampolines some day :P 
Just ran back home from the lightening n thunder , so scary :( 
yes we should live in peace with each other , n the human anger brings no good :( \ 
but still I've managed to hold it back for 8 months , what else could I do ? 
the insomnia seems coming back again , is it bcs the weather ? \ 
early day tomorrow :( 
tired but happy :) 
so that Fashion World game could be addictive :P 
just when I think things finally started working out :( 
I guess it's time to try to learn swimming again :P 
has great daddies :D 
\rain is a good thing\ " :P \ 
that Blue < PROPFEMALE > almonds of wasabi & soy sauce flavor taste sooooooooo good !!!!!!! \ 
I never knew they have all those strange flavors , also got one of jalapeno , hope they r spicy enough , it's so hard to find real spicy food here :( 
this sleeping problem is really out of control now , should I just give th sleeping pill a try ? 
They've had almost every door in the library painted into a weird yellowish color , \ 
so creepy :P 
but we < PROPFEMALE > in tribulations also :\ 
knowing that tribulation worketh < PROPFEMALE >;\ 
And < PROPFEMALE > , experience ;\ 
and experience , hope ;\ 
And hope maketh not ashamed ; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given onto us . \ 
ROMANS 5:3 -5 
is going to be a sleepy driver now :( 
two things off the to-do list , quite a productive day :) \ 
now with less distraction , I could just focus on my tribulation :P 
let it be a sweet sweet song !!!! :D 
so now , I wanna my boring summer days back :( 
feels singing and dancing !!! \ 
It's just so incredible every time when I looking back n realized how much change has happened to that \I don't deserve happiness\ " me ~ \ 
so I've finally got text messaging for my phone now :) 
just passed the driving test ~ \ 
this last month of summer really is productive !!!!! 
got back from a walk in the rain , \ 
with some cute stationery n an umbrella , not as pretty as my lost one , but at least it's purple :) 
Had a great time baking cakes n decorating cookies with some awesome people , never knew baking could be so much fun !!! :D \ 
The frosting's a little intimidating at first , but sometimes the imperfect could turn out to be quite cute too :P 
was trying to go to sleep , but some creepy people've been making noise right outside the window for more than an hr !!! \ 
What kind of person would stand at the parking lots talking aloud after midnight ?! \ 
wouldn't it at least be more comfortable to just stay in the car ? 
had bad milk , it's not even old :/ lol 
so afraid now , I know I can do it , \ 
but do I HAVE to deal with mean people ? :( 
had fast food for dinner with < PROPFEMALE > , \ 
n successfully made a creepy horror movie theme from some innocent kid's song lol 
hyper again :P \ 
I guess short nap does work better than the longer ones ~ 
so I have to get up before 7:00 am tomorrow , n I just can't go to sleep , \ 
rly sldn't have any coffee tonight =( 
God rly has sense of humor ~ \ 
Since it would be an exhausting day anyway , why not making a mess n having some fun ?! lol 
got lost on campus , AGAIN !!! \ 
sigh ~~~~~ 
Why do onions hate human's eyes so much ? ++ 
early class tomorrow , \ 
don't wanna go to sleep ~~~~~~~~~ 
Is it just some kindda persistence of vision ??? 
fell in love with a song , \ 
maybe it's time to start singing again ~~~~~ hope my \old\ " vocal cord hasn't got < PROPMALE > yet ~~~~~~" 
gym n free food , what a Saturday morning ! :D 
So fidgeting n feels screaming in the middle of the class : Q\ 
Needs sleep !!! 
Ok , so I have < PROPFEMALE > n I know all humanbeings r stupid on some level , including me . \ 
But if someone don't wanna learn at all , why came to school at the 
survived another Monday , 31 more to go ~ 
so anyone interested in that rafting trip ? \ 
got caught in something n can't go but I've already paid the deposit n it's nonrefundable :( 
Can I just cross off Mons n Wens from my calenders ? 
How stupid has a person to be to hate something he/ she doesn't even know ? 
Praying for strength n trying to work on my < PROPFEMALE > in hardships ~ 
So I was in this class about PDE(partial differential equations ) n there r a full board of physics formula on the side wall(sth about electrostastic pote 
ntial energy ) n I just found them so beautiful n so much more attractive than those equations on the board in front of me , I just started copy them onto 
my notebook :P \ 
So it's terminal : I can see beautiful in everything except maths , yet I'm a maths < PROPMALE > ~~~~~ 
so I haven't completely got how the < PROPFEMALE > stuff goes :( \ 
but singing rly brought back life into me , it worked , every time :) 
So close yet impossible to fall asleep in the topology class , since there r only 6 students in the classroom :P 
Hating myself for being so weak ~~~ 
Needs the solution : so hard to stay here ~~~ 
stop running away , start living ~~~~~~ \ 
it's hard , but I'm gonna try harder this time =) 
bed time already , yet I still got tons of stuff to get ready for classes tomorrow ~ \ 
so another Wednesday packed with exhausting n boring works ' approaching , just wanna stop time n maybe have another Tuesday =( \ 
Hating it so much n only feel tortured , try to look at the bright side : maybe that's my < PROPMALE > to work on patience ~~~~~~~~~~ 
it's just too much to endure ~ 
\I know you hate to see me cry 
Be strong and courageous . \ 
Do not be terrified ; do not be discouraged , \ 
for the LORD your God will be with you wherever you go . \ 
< PROPFIRST > 1:9 
So tired that I could just pass out right now ~ \ 
But I can't because I've got a full board of theorems to copy onto my notebook : @ 
used the dish washer first time since moved in , \ 
n it was leaking !!! foam all over the floor ~~~~~ `\ 
Such a disater =( 
grading for calculus is nothing but pure torture , \ 
almost done with one class , a even bigger stack to go , \ 
hope I can still see the sunrise tomorrow ~~~~~~~~~~~ 
just found a massive messed-up at work , \ 
probably won't have much time to sleep tonight n have to get up super early tomorrow to fix it , after that is a day full of classes ~ \ 
but I don't care !!! because my God is with me , n He's gonna be my strength , \ 
n I know ( one hundred percent sure now ) that he's always listening to my prayers , even sometimes they seem unanswered , but it WILL be all set someday ~ 
tried to go to sleep , but couldn't , bcs of the excitement :P \ 
so I'm gonna go back grading now ~ 
Only 3 hrs of sleep last night- so tired but still functioning , hope I can make through 3pm ~ \ 
5 n half more hrs to go\ 
~ zzzzzzz ~ 
so I guess tiredness does make u feel weaker :( 
Had a great Bible study time , now going back to the struggle with Maths ~ \ 
Wednesday again , early n packed classes , hope I can finish the material for teaching soon n get enough sleep tonight ~ 
Have tried my best , but it's just too hard to keep wasting my life like this ~~~~ 
Having lots of flashbacks recently ~~~~~ 
Run out of < PROPFEMALE > , \ 
Better make some change before fall back into that ' can I just go to sleep n never wake up ? ' status ~ 
Still on my way , but I will get there one day : find my life back , become the person I used to n supposed to be ~ 
Being confident of this , that he who began a good work in you , will < PROPFEMALE > it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus . \ 
Philipians 1:6 
no vegetable left except carrot & onion =( \ 
making pilaf for lunch , smells so good :P 
so the good thing is there's a computer in the classroom I'm teaching , taking a break while the students doing the problems =) 
limping around with a bloody toe , \ 
why do I keep doing clumsy things like that ? =( 
might ' ve been singing too much recently , \ 
have to stop singing n start studying maths for the test now =( \ 
why can't I be one of those people doing things they love for a living ? 
got caught off guard :\ 
how do u explain stuff u've learned first year in mid school that's already become kindda of nature to others ? 
got a bunch of chocolate , so happy now ^@^ 
\million star\ " season 7 have got the best singers ever ! " 
just had the best steak , \ 
the lamb chop recipe works for steak too ^^ ~ 
so stressed out ~ \ 
but the things I'm dealing with now r either too important I don't wanna quit , or though as pointless as they r but I can't quit ~~~~~~~~~ 
Ok so there r so many things I don't understand , but why WHY did God create those bloodsucking insects ? 
I'm not ho t-t empered , just some people rly bring out the worst of me , \ 
so depressing ~~~~~ 
got home finding a UPS notice on door , \ 
missed my keyboard , HAVE TO WAIT TILL MONDAY !!! ~~~~ =/ 
spinach bagel always makes me happy =D 
GOT MY KEYBOARD , FINALLY !!! \ 
had to drag home two boxes as big as I am all the way from leasing office(so glad it's not a drum set =D ) 
so according to the high annual ave temp , Tampa could make a good rain < PROPMALE > , \ 
if only we had a \closed canopy\ " vegetation here ~ " 
hard decision :\ 
don't wanna be \the quitter\ " 
grading calculus 2 surely is no fun , had to music it up , \ 
tons of more \no fun at all\ " painful \ " thm proving\ " HW to be done tomorrow 
can't sleep , \ 
why is this so hard ? 
sometimes doing the right thing could be so painful ~~~~~ \ 
but that's what surrender about , \ 
and nothing could beat the peace God set in my heart =) 
\I will give you the treasures of darkness 
\it's like the sun is shining 
finished them all !!!! \ 
it's impossible , but I finally got them all done !!! \ 
go to sleep now , hope 5hrs sleep would get me enough energy to get those 2 classes n two teaching sections tomorrow done = = zzzzzzz 
having a class at 8:30 am , but I couldn't sleep , \ 
so just got up and write stuff , \ 
I almost forget how good late night writing feels , missing it so much ~~~ 
is so tired but happy =) \ 
only got 3 hrs of sleep , 3 classes done , still functioning , hopefully I will make through the last class too , then choir rehearsal at 6:30 pm ( so happy I got most of my voice back) ~ 
Wednesday nights are the best , in every way !!! 
I will give you the treasures of darkness , \ 
riches stored in secret places , \ 
so that you may know that I am the LORD , \ 
the God of Israel , \ 
who summons you by name . \ 
< PROPMALE > 45:3 
I guess it takes much time n pain to change from \the grey\ " to \ " the white\ " =P " 
sometimes things you think you don't even remember anymore could've just affected it so much ~ 
lots of chocolate n SPINACH BAGEL ? \ 
This week gonna be so much better than last one ^^ ~ 
lamb soup in cold weather ~ \ 
it's amazing how much soothing power could be held in food =D 
ok , so I'm officially old :\ 
found myself falling for songs in 80's(or even 70's ) , \ 
those ancient people did know how to make things poetic ~ 
They said when u getting older , u would need less sleep , but somehow it's working opposite to me . ( anyway , isn't it true older cars need more gas ? ) 
\I have nothing more \ 
Anyone else has been exhausted from doing things no more than just a waste of time ? \ 
Wondering if the place they keep psychos could be any worse ~ 
is done with all the pretending , gonna put the twisted fake smile away . \ 
Just hope the professor won't freak out if I actually burst into tears in the middle of a maths class ~ 
is it ok if I keep going to both FBCTT and Aletheia every Sunday morning ? 
missed the bus , had to run to a class =( \ 
I do need to do some cardio , though , so it might be a good thing =) 
\If my arms could reach you 
Must lost her mind ? 
need to get off the keyboard n GO STUDY !!! \ 
Why r there so many addictive things in this world ? =/ 
Is there a place I can just scream n throw stuff on the walls ? 
nothing is harder than waiting , knowing nothing about when n what's gonna happen ~

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 
need to relocate the FOCUS n be CONTENT !!! \ 
( have been hearing the same thing everywhere I go today , amazing yet kindda creepy =P )\ 
so I don't see the point now but it doesn't mean my life is meaningless ; \ 
feeling like having lost everything doesn't mean I sld be coveting ;\ 
waiting is so painful n intolerable , but that's just a great opportunity to work on my < PROPFEMALE > ~~~ 
Let's see if I can live through Dec 3 ~ 
has eaten way too much chocolate lately , \ 
someone sld invent 0 cal & 0 carb chocolate =[ 
If I don't survive this time , at least there will be a closure : 5 n half years , dying yet kept breathing through machine , that's long enough ~ 
This is the hardest thing I ever had to do : let go , not always trying to keep things under control ~ \ 
Maybe , someday , I'll be able to realize those broken dreams , or maybe they would stay lost forever , but I'm not living for them anymore ~ \ 
It's my life but not mine ~ 
sometimes u read n memerize those scriptures over n over , u thought u've fully understanded n can't get anymore from them , but there's just something missing , until one day God decided to move ur heart n show u their true meanings ~ 
Gonna live on fastfood until final tests : it's so much better when lunch doesn't include cooking n dish washing =D 
is so grateful for everything happening in my life , good or bad , \ 
because I know God wld make all these work together for something wonderful ~ 
Smells turkey everywhere I go , what a lovely day^^ 
I'm so not grown up enough for conversations like this >=[ no other place is as creepy as hospitals ~ 
definitely gonna switch bank after finishes my checkbook !!! 
so I guess it's a bad idea to study on holidays , there is no opening place =( 
so I've successfully put off the sentence till tomorrow , but it's still coming ~ \ 
2 presentations , 2 homework , n a final test in the coming week , all in courses I barely know anything about , \ 
if I cld survive this one I wld be able to figure things out during the winter break , \ 
if not ... \ 
well , I just got to start the figuring out part earlier , no big deal =/ 
some day ... 
maybe lock the memory in words n music isn't such a good idea =/\ 
but I will get those books & CDs back one day ~ 
7 days to go ~~~ 
onions , < PROPFEMALE > n lots of wasabi , \ 
can't afford catching a cold ~ 
This got to end , now !!!!! 
So sick of all the proctoring tests n grading 
Counting minutes , how long will the silent screaming last before it dies ? This cld be fun ~ 
That proves sometimes being a smart kid cld end up much worse than being dumb ~ 
sadly found out : I'm < PROPFEMALE > ... >=( 
is completely clueless , yet so excited ~ \ 
it's hard but I know I will survive ~ 
gonna plant cacao trees in the back yard someday , \ 
ferment the fruit from pods n roast the seeds to make all kinds of chocolate by myself ~ 
rly hope this is the last test I have to grade >:[ 
maybe I sld give sleeping pills a try , or sedative ? \ 
my own heart is killing me ~~~ 
How stupid am I to keep torturing myself with things like this ?????????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
just found the funnies instrument in the whole world , \ 
I LOVE MY NEW TOY !!!! 
need strength n courage , \ 
doing the right thing may hurt the ones I love n myself , but it has to be done ~ 
is in serious trouble now ): [ 
IT'S TOO COLD TO BE FLORIDA !!! \ 
the houses r just not made for this :\ 
it's like camping outdoors every night =/ 
finished the tests , \ 
now comes the difficult part ~ 
=) 
Can a single person adopt kids ? \ 
Those children's singing was like the most beautiful sound in the world !!! 
so I might be crazy , \ 
but if there's something you've been spending ur whole life looking for n finally found it , it's just stupid not doing anything about it ~ 
? ! \ 
?? !! \ 
??? !!! \ 
!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Just stuffed a fridge with amost thirty lunch boxes , it's like playing with bricks , so much fun =D 
< PROPMALE > 49:3 ~ 5 
it's so frustrating to deal with people who r obstinate n unwilling to listen even when they know there's something going wrong =/ 
=[ 
is breathing again ~ \ 
There's nothing I wanted more than simply end everything , but He just wouldn't leave me alone dying ~ \ 
So I will keep walking untilI fail again , because God's always there ready to pick me up n put me back on my feet ~
