The ones who appear quiet are always the dangerous ones . 
When someone cries everyone has to know but when they stop you leave them alone , NOSY PEOPLE , that's what they are wanting to know why when really no one cares . |: 
You know , I trusted you and I listened to all your annoying boy chiz , you know why ? THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS DO . They don't lie and break promises , you're so lucky I won't sink to your level and tell everyone everything cuhs you're not worth it . 
TOMORROW , TOMORROW , I can't wait for tomorrow ~ (: Or is it today ? 
I could tell you one thousand great reasons why you're so unbelievably awesome , but that still wouldn't be enough for you because you know you're way more awesome than that . ( You just don't know it yet ) - Lesliejane M . Pada (: 
HERE WITH < PROPFEMALE > Martinez SHE'S SLEEPING OVER lol I'm sucha dork xD 
Wake up every morning with the thought that something WONDERFUL is about to happen . (: 
Every day is different so stop treating them like they're all the same . 
I'm sorry can you leave , because your face and just your very existence pisses me off , thanks .

< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > mahal kita , be strong and you'll make it , I know you will , you'll be in our prayers and hearts forever .

If home is where the heart is , then my home is lost at sea . 
Finished Eureka , absolutely amazing . <3

I wrote you a song , but then got to shy to sing it to you . 
\ If perfect is what you're searching for then just stay the same \ " <3 " 
OH KRISPY KREME HOW I MISS YOU . I remember stealing a bunch of those dorky paper hats . Awh memories of eating donuts . ( x 
That 70's Show . It pwns . :P 
OMG . I can't friggin ' believe it's not friggin ' butter . Yupp . 
Green Tea Ice Cream . <3 I am so Asian . :P 
Summer's going by way to fast , nuff said . 
< PROPFEMALE > Ramirez Sorry haha , we talked to long & my cell died out . Can't wait to go to the movies , it's been awhile . < : 
The promises that you promised are about as real as an air guitar . So watch your back cuhs I'mma steal your car . < : 
Heehee . (: 
I can't help but smile when you're so clumsy , I find it adorable . ( x 
Is it really surprising that music can make anyone feel better ? 
I love < PROPMALE > Mars CD , it's absolutely AMAZING <3 
Just\ 
because I smile doesn't mean I'm okay , just because I don't say \ 
anything doesn't mean I'm fine , I'm feeling like , I don't even know . \ 
People at school think I'm doing fine , but I'm not . I'm tired of holding\ 
it in , so rest in peace < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > . I love you . 
That smile is to real to be true ... 
\ Don’t find love 
Only reason people hold onto memories so tight is because memories never change when the people you made them with do . 
New Cell , need < PROPFIRST > , all over again ): Messages only please =P 
I'mma shoot you with my mini water gun with grape juice then you'll be all sticky ... so HAHAHAHAHAHA !!!!!! :D 
YAHOOTIE . [: 
I love the way you are , you're you . I don't see ANYTHING wrong with that , you're absolutely amazing . Don't ever change , so what you're a little clumsy ... that's cute . (: 
I'm SORRY , but I'm not freakin ' RIHANNA , I don't love the way you lie . I HATE IT . 
Shut up before I pour milk down your nostrils . >:| 
\ I'd rather have a few close friends that without a doubt will be there \ 
So I heard you like _____ yet you won't even talk to _______ , I added to much underscores than needed haha ... 
I hate when your parents compare you to other people , when they say they hated being compared as a kid . Let's see , HYPOCRITE MUCH ? Gosh , I'm me , my own person . Get it through your freakin ' head . 
I understand you can't or don't want to tell me everything , but all I'm asking is please don't lie to me . 
Somewhere there’s someone , who dreams about your smile , and finds in\ 
your presence that life is worth while , so when you are lonely , \ 
remember it’s true , somebody somewhere is thinking of you . <3 
Chances are \ 
like lightning , they never hit the earth at the same spot twice . So when\ 
a < PROPMALE > comes your way , grab it cause it may never come again . 
Haters hate on you cause they can . But they could never spend a day in your shoes and survive . 
You gave me one good reason to fight and never give up and walk away , and that reason is you . Thank you for being there when I needed you the most . <3 
< PROPMALE > Mars is an inspiration . <3 
So just ? stop , blaming us because\ 
\ 
It's not wrong to be young . 
Don't forget that the same person who smiles , laughs , and seems pretty \ 
happy with their life , may possibly be same person who cries themselves \ 
to sleep . 
Our eyes are on our front because it's so we can look ahead instead of looking back . 
Time passes . Memories fade . Feelings \ 
change . People leave . But hearts never forget . \ 
\

— Cherlynn Shakespeare 
Going seven days without laughing makes one weak . 
I had no destination , then you took my hand and told me , \ Go where your heart takes you . \"" 
Yesterday was amazing , just shows no matter what a friend can make the worst day turn to your happiest . <3 
Pointing out another person's flaws doesn't make yours disappear , because face it , we’re all imperfect . 
You hate on me to feel good ? That's too bad , because you don't know anything about me . You're calling ME the loser , I'm not the one looking down on others I don't know . JEALOUSY IS A SIN . I heard you go to church every Sunday , mind listening for once ? |:< 
ONE DAY SOMEONE WILL TELL YOU THE TRUTH ABOUT YOU & WHEN THAT DAY COMES I'LL BE HERE TO LAUGH IN YOUR FACE WHEN YOU CRY . |:< 
If you don't go after what you want , you'll never have it . If you don't ask , the answer is always no . If you don't step forwardm you're always in the same place . 
The things I'll never say ... <3 
Stop drowning in your own self pity & get back up & face the world , show them how wonderful you are . 
I know it may sound stupid or may even be stupid , but yesterday on October 10th , 2010 my wish was for you ... (: 
NO , You don't understand so shut up . It doesn't matter how I feel for YOU , it matters how you're the only one I feel that way FOR . You're my friend & I love you . (: 
< PROPFEMALE > Lam & me friends since Kindergarten & < PROPFEMALE > Martinez friends since 2nd grade , ' til now still counting . (: Great day ... but I got a big choice to make -_________- 
Pick a School : Concord or Mount 
What If - < PROPFIRST > Derulo <3 
< PROPFEMALE > Tejano Younis leave it to you to leave me with a smile . ( x 
A to Z 
Braced myself for the goodbye , cause that's all I've ever known . Then , you took me by surprise & you said , \I'll never leave you alone . \ " <3 " 
\ Don't bring me into your life if I'm just going to be brought out again . \ " ); " 
Stop being so selfish & stupid actin ' like you got nothing when really you have more than most kids . Ungrateful much ? 
I can be a nice person & I will be , but like other people I can only take your crap up ' til a certain point so don't be surprised if I shove you & your bs out of my life . 
Happy international artist's day & happy birthday to Picasso . <3 
If the people who were in your past not here with you now , it's because they did something that led them to NOT being in YOUR future , your present . 
I brought you into my life & people may have called you my mistake , but I consider you as my lesson . Thank you for teaching not everyone is worth holding on to . 
I'll never give up on you , unless you give me a reason too , I will never leave you , unless you force me too , and lastly you will never be out of my mind simply because I love you . Have you figured that out yet ? 
You claim your life is hard , I hear on the news everyday bad news . It may be hard but try to think about what you have , accept it , love it , & < PROPFEMALE > it . Because what you have & claim is bad is what someone else wishes for . - Lesliejane M . Pada ( x 
If you're sad , I'll be sad too . If you're in pain , I'll be in pain too . If you're crying , I will cry too . Why would I do all these things ? It's because I will never leave you alone especially when it comes to times like this . I'm here for you forever & always . Don't you dare forget that . 
Rock Music <3 
\ I'm sorry \ " Too bad it's too late & I don't really care . " 
I don't want to spoil the ending for you or anything , but I think you should know everything will be alright . (= 
Without a doubt , you're all I ever dream about . (= 
Hey < PROPFEMALE > Tejano Younis's birthday is tomorrow , cake her ! (= 
Hope you had a happy birthday at school < PROPFEMALE > Tejano Younis have a better now that you're out of school haha watch < PROPMALE > Songz jump out of a cake ( x 
Can't wait for tomorrow , no , not for the friggin ' Renaissance Rally , but for the response I've been waiting for <3 
LSHMCEMMBAIADMBOR - LAUGHING SO HARD MY CHINKY EYES MADE ME BLIND AND I ALMOST DROPPED MY BOWL OF RICE . 
I have to say I'm disappointed in you , but it's my fault for expecting you to care . Over all , great day though thanks to my friends . <3 
Do the right thing . & punch that * insert unbelievably \awesome\ " word here * in the face . " 
When life is going down , turn the music up . 
One life is all we have and we live it as we believe \ 
in living it . But to sacrifice what you are and to live without belief , \ 
that is a fate more terrible than dying . - < PROPFIRST > of Arc 
I went two days without seeing your face so far . Too bad it felt like a whole week . ): 
HEY YOU ! YEA YOU . You're face it annoys me . JOKE < PROPFEMALE > ! I love itttt . [ x Ahaha , we're such losers . xD 
\ We're BUSTEDDDDDDDDDD ........... \ " - A Goofy Movie I love that movie <3 " 
PACMAN WON AGAIN , WOOHOO(from Rianna Diaz ) AHAHAHAHA PHILLIPINES IS UNDEFEATABLE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ( = 
What a great start to my week <3 
Life takes your dreams and turns it upside down , \ 
friends talk about you when you’re not around . People make promises they\ 
can’t keep and I have come to realize that talk is cheap . Too often we \ 
don’t realize what we have until it’s gone , too often we wait too long . Sometimes we hurt the ones we hold \ 
close to our hearts and we allow foolish things to tear us apart but in \ 
the end , life still goes on . 
Don't ever frown , because someone could be falling in love with your smile . Don't cry because we need to conserve water . & most importantly never be sad because each second you are sad is a second you could have had to be happy . 
Every person in the world can give me one reason each why I should give up on you & I'd look for one , just one , reason to not give up on you & use that reason to it's extent , that's how much I care about you . 
\ It doesn't matter what you were you there for . That was the past . I need you now & no surprise you're not here . When it came down to it I found out you weren't more than sh ): t . \"" 
I have a Canon PowerShot S70 .... who wants to donate batteries for it ? :D IT'S BEEN LIKE 5 MONTHS I CAN'T FIND ANY . 
GC - \ Like it's her birthday \ " < : " 
Love is < PROPFEMALE > . Take your time . Wait because if you love them then obviously they're worth waiting for . & most importantly with all that waiting never give up . 
\ Chemistry like apple & cinnamon . \ " <3 " 
Want to know the difference between memories & promises ? We break promises , but memories break us . 
Spending my whole week at Napa . (= 
Jealousy looks really ugly with that outfit of yours . 
BACK HOME ~ ! <3 Fattening food , music , yepp nothing is better than this . 
Cake Boss <3 
People say hate is a strong word & you shouldn't use it , but look at everyone throwing around the even stronger word \love\ " like it's nothing . " 
You're so full of sh_t . 
Thanks for the smile you gave me , I'm currently wearin ' it . (= 
Life was meant for us to live that's why it's called LIFE , we need to take risks in order to learn , gain , appreciate & be blown away . 
Today was good <3 
Stop saying feel better or asking why I'm upset . Why can't you understand , no , why can't you see that all this is because of you ? 
Even in a crowded room my eyes will always search for you & once I see you , you're the only person in the room . 
I love how you avoid my questions . It's totally awesome . Notice my sarcasm . 
Green glow in the dark Converse , they may be shoes , but they made my day <3 
Rocketeer - Far East Movement <3 
It's a fact most people hesitate to tell people they love them until it's to late . Please , don't be one of them . 
Are you serious ? It's been like 3 days & Tumblr keeps saying it's unavailable , my butt . I need to go on ittttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt . 
“If you love someone , tell him or her . Forget about the rules or the \ 
fear of looking ridiculous . What is truly ridiculous is passing up on an\ 
opportunity to tell someone that your heart is invested in him or her . ” I know someone who should read this & tell someone how they feel .... 
I don't need you to say a word to me , at all , all I need is for you to be there , not because you feel like you have to or need too , but simply because you want to . Because you want to comfort me , because you care about me , because you love me . - Yes , I am guilty , I created this . x : 
Mount or Concord ? Concord has a Health & Medicine Academy ? I heard Mount has one too , idk . D: xD 
Am I too nice ? I don't think so , but ... 
I want to swim in a pool full of j-ello . 
You can't avoid pain , but you have the option of suffering or not . 
If love is an ocean , then I'm lost at sea . (= 
I know this is selfish but I really don't want to be another chapter in your life , I want to be the whole book . To put it simply I want to be your everything , you're already mine . 
YOU KNOW THOSE KNOCK OFF CHIZ YOU SEE AT LIKE EVERY STORE ? Like it's a copy of something & has a different name , different manufacture , but looks like what it's copying & supposed to taste like what it's copying ? I HATE THOSE THINGS . It bugs the heck out of me . Chiz like TWONKIES , Yummy O's , like wtf . xD 
Make up your f_cking mind . You want to be friends or not ? Because all that sh_t that's been coming out of your mouth is telling me otherwise . You think you're better than me ? I'm not the best , but sweetie you're not even close to being \ okay \"" 
It's hard to figure out where to go nowadays . Go to the left , where nothing's right ? Or go the right , where nothing's left ? 
With his headband , long socks , running around & absolutely adorable dorkyness , he's my Paulie Bleeker . <3 
& So I asked . 
Before you tell ME what to do with MY life . You should get YOUR sh_t together first . Before you tell ME that I'M ugly , maybe YOU should look in the mirror first . No matter how much make up you put on that face it won't cover the ugly person beneath it all . 
To me , you'll always be the one I'd want to be with , even if it's just us doing nothing at all . 
But you're better than the guy of my dreams , you're real . 
I hate how I get freedom when I don't need it , but when I do or when I really want it , it is purposely taken away from me . 
Everything I do is for you , but you don't f_cking appreciate any of it . & you wonder why I get so depressed ? & you wonder why I just yell at you sometimes ? & then you yell at ME , for being the one who's unappreciative . Bullsh_t . 
FRUITY PEBBLES <3 
If only see you through my eyes , then you'd realize how amazing you are . 
When it comes to Christmas so many people are forgotten , give to someone who needs this Christmas . <3 (= 
Does anyone else feel that Christmas isn't the same as it sued to be this year ? 
Staying up for the noche < PROPFEMALE > & 12 AM mass . (= 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas ! ( = 
I got my ears pierced , AGAIN . Haha , I also got a haircut but that was a long time ago . xD 
Life has officially screwed me over ... sh_t . 
I hate how when you ask me if somethings wrong & I say it's nothing , you don't push . You leave it at that . I'm selfish I really am , but really all I want is for someone who wants to listen , someone who cares enough to keep insisting me to pour my heart out , someone who already knows without asking that something is wrong , but really I just want someone , anyone to understand . 
2010 was probably the best year of my life & I'll miss it , but I have no problem welcoming 2011 . New year , new memories , new friends , yea that's great , but I really hope that this year will bring me as much happiness as this year , hopefully more . (= 
People say I'm talented , but really I'm nothing but passionate . I don't think when it comes to my < PROPMALE > , I feel . 
Others can say you don't deserve me , I could do better , & you're not worth my time . Yea , but here's the thing none of the people who tell me that knows how you make me feel & how you do make me feel is really all that matters . 
I'd sing you a song or write you a poem but no words of mine are good enough for such an amazing person as you . <3 
Marry You - Glee Version <3 
\ Some people care too much . I think it's called love . \ " - < PROPFEMALE > the Pooh (= " 
I want you to see yourself through my eyes , so you'd stop putting yourself down & realize the amazing , wonderful , fantastic person you are . 
It's up to you , be happy or sulk in depression . Don't act as if you can't be happy because that's bullsh_t . 
I hate , HATE , how when I talk to you & you say all the wrong things ... at the wrong times ... & you still expect me to tell you everything , when obviously you don't care . 
Sometimes I feel you're just a waste of my words . 
Our mistakes don't define who we are . 
< PROPFEMALE > Martinez you made my day , nothing new , but hey , I know this was on your wall of things you would love people to say to you . ( x 
You know the people who KNOW the LEAST about you always so much CRAP to say . 
One of the best feelings in the world is when you go to look at that special someone but when you do they're already looking at you with a great smile on their face . <3 
If you're going to be two faced at least make one worth looking at you ugly hoe . 
I don't expect you to care or anything , I'm just saying it'd be nice . 
I'm tired of your sh_t . Go have your period in a shark tank b_tch . 
Someone wanna give me a ride to the meeting tomorrow ? 
I wrote to the board of education , & I am so proud of < PROPFEMALE > Martinez ! 
OMFSUSHTAGDHYU BEST FEELING EVER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <3 
You're the boy who I'd love to hold hands with . The boy who would have my heart in an instant , that is if he asked for it . The boy who I'd give my smile to , but sadly I'm sure you can't say the same goes for me too ... 
Talent show soon , singing in front of people ... OMG . D: 
Have faith in yourself & eventually , you'll get there . 
Don't ever give up on yourself because you're someone's reason for holding on . 
Try & bring me down all you want , I'll just wake up every morning with a smile & shake that sh_t off . ( x 
Somewhere , someone is looking up to you . Don't let that person down . 
I'm not saying living life will be easy . I'm saying it'll be worth it . 
We made it on the news , TWICE in one day Top Story ohyez .. SO TAKE THAT OTHER SCHOOLS . <3 
You have so much to live for , keep your mind open . 
Since it's girls ask guys , should I ask him ? Haha .. 
& I asked . < PROPFEMALE > Lam needs to give someone something , haha . ( x 
You like her , she likes you . Go out already . xD 
Really ? They're closing US down , we fought . WE PUT UP A FIGHT . We did more than any other damn school & everyone knows it . We DESERVE to stay open , not just because we fought but because we have so MUCH potential , just wait when all the kids from GMS are world leaders . We're going to prove everyone wrong . 
[ Many , not all lol]People of Claycord , you disappoint me , disgust me , and just bring shame upon yourselves . Community ? According to what people have to say , not exactly . \\: 
Yea , thanks , but any guy can tell me he loves me . Be special & show me you love me , prove it to me . 
No words can comprehend your beauty . 
You want to fly ? Let go of the sh_t that's weighing you down . 
Having few true friend is better than having a large network of pretentious friends . Quality beats quantity all the time . 
All these people say they love my words , but my biggest disappointment is that i can't change people's lives with them . If I could , I would , especially for you . Because life is meant for us to live , not to be wasted . 
Forget the 14th of February . I love you everyday from now until forever . 
How could they NOT play the Titantic on < PROPFIRST>'s Day ? What do I do now ? I need to watch < PROPMALE > DiCaprio xD 
Want revenge ? Live a happy life . That's what bugs the people who try & want to bring you down , show them they can't affect you . Show them how you're able to be able happy without putting others down . 
< PROPFEMALE > Martinez , HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA . 
If you need to make a decision , flip a coin . It works because once that coin is in the air you realize which choice you're hoping to land . 
IT'S A BIRD ! IT'S A PLANE ! OH , wait NO , it's the flying f_ck I don't give . 
Just because I smile everyday doesn't mean I'm not secretly dying inside . I smile because I choose too . I smile because I want to show even though my world is crashing down , I can still find the time to put the problems aside & just be happy . 
Hey , I'm not trying to impress you or anything , but I watch PG movies without parental guidance . I know , pretty bad ass . 
Dump that stupid hoe . She's trash already , what difference would it make putting her back in the garbage ? 
I like being the one you can come to , but I love being the only one you come to . <3 
Life doesn't give you the people you want . It gives you the people you need . The people to love you , be there for you , break you , leave you and shape you . To make you the person you were meant to be . 
\ Sometimes people have to cry out all their tears ... to make a heart full of smiles \"" 
I hope one day you choke on the sh_t you talk . 
Batman & < PROPFIRST > is on <3 
I'm going to close my eyes & count to three & see if you're still there , because babe you're too good to be true . <3 (= 
If I push anyone it's to see who cares enough to stay instead of walk away . 
Someone worth having is worth waiting for , & that is what I'm willing to do for you . 
< PROPFEMALE > Arquines was here , she's gonna win a bet ! 
I'm always there for you , you're never there for me . I'd do anything for you , you wouldn't do half of those things for me ... 
Nobody has it easy , everybody has problems . You don't know what they go through . Nobody is perfect , nobody deserves to be perfect . So before you start judging , criticizing , mocking , remember everybody is fighting their own war . 
< PROPFEMALE > Tejano Younis & < PROPFEMALE > Martinez no words can ever explain how happy I am to have you two in my life . Thank you guys so friggin ' much . <3 
But compared to your eyes , nothing shines quite as bright . 
Let me just say , you've got what it takes . You're amazing & NEVER doubt yourself . 
Who are you to judge the life I live ? I know I'm not perfect & I don't live to be . Before you start pointing fingers , make sure your hands are clean . 
I hate being expected of so much . One achievement leads to so much more expectations , it's as if no one understands . Parents believe it should be easy , they think we don't get stressed because we don't have jobs ? Please , if they only knew the half of it . 
Just because you're alive doesn't mean you're really LIVING . Happiness begins at the point of acceptance . The point when we stop questioning why sometimes things are unfair . Just accept & go on , be happy . 
Let's be loud , let's be crazy , let's live life as if there's no tomorrow , there is OUR time & we might as well live it up . 
Being positive may not solve my every problem , but I'll say this . It makes solving any problem more pleasant . 
SO let's make those tales come true . Go with me on a magic carpet ride , let's go under the sea , maybe you'll find me at 12 o'clock and hand me a glass slipper , then at the end of the day you can take me on horseback to a castle . As long as I'm with you , anything can be true . <3 
There are times in your life where you can do nothing but wait , but there are also times where you need to make things happen . Don't expect things to just be handed to you , because it doesn't work that way . 
No matter how hideous you think you are , there will always be someone who sees you and believes you are the most beautiful person this world has to offer , and the thing is , nothing could ever change that . 
I dislike when people are too scared to actually live . Just because you're \ alive \ " doesn't mean you're really living .. " 
Yes , you can hold my hand if you want to , because I want to hold your hand too . <3 
When I walked home today I saw a piece of sh_t on the ground , it reminded me of you . 
Don't you hate how the person(s ) you love the most are your BIGGEST weaknesses ? /: 
Don't let your emotions overpower your intelligence . 
I never cried so much before . Challenge day was more than I could have ever imagined , it was real . 
HATE is easy to do ; LOVE , now LOVE takes courage . 
I'd risk the fall just to know how it feels to fly . 
Hakuna Matata - It means no worries . 
< PROPFEMALE > Lam & < PROPFEMALE > Martinez , your hero of pure awesomeness is here . 
Apparently , effort isn't good enough . 
& even when it rains the sun continues to shine in your eyes BABY . Haha . 
If you don't like how things are you make a change , if you can't make a change then accept the reality . 
< PROPFEMALE > Martinez I don't need a telescope to look at the < PROPFEMALE > s/go < PROPFEMALE > gazing , because all I need is to look in yours BABY . 
Everyone goes through problems , but there are some people who choose to look towards the brighter side & usually those are the people we would least expect to go through those problems , usually those people are the inspirations . 
Multi was fun , I didn't do much , but just being there was amazing . (: 
Don't count the sunsets , count the sunrises . 
The real battle scars are from the times we fell for the wrong one . 
No matter what , people will believe whatever they want about me , others , everything & anything . All I can do in this harsh , judgmental world is be who I am , I will stay true to myself & I won't be what others assume I should be , want me to be , etc . F_ck that . I'm me , deal with it . 
Overthinking leads to negativity , so when it comes to love just let your feelings overtake your thoughts for once because love is a beautiful feeling , emotion , experience , event in life & you don't want to ruin it by insecurity or negativity . Just love . 
Every moment with you , just being with you is like having all my wishes come true , actually , it is . <3 
It's true , I smile whenever I see him haha . (: 
It's much better to face these kinds of things with a sense of poise & rationality . 
Being happy doesn't make you weak , sometimes it shows your strength . 
\ It's wiser to be alone but happy than with somebody who does nothing while your doing everything . \ " - Batman <3 " 
< PROPFEMALE > Lam & < PROPFEMALE > Martinez you guys better check yourselves before you wreck yourselves . 
You shouldn't care what others think about you because really , if they say all those stupid things about you without really knowing you , they AREN'T thinking .
