When you < PROPFEMALE > your bible , Satan gets a headache . When you open it , he collapses . When he sees you reading it , he faints . When he sees you living it , he flees . And just when you're about to re-post this , he'll try to discourage you ...... Any takers ?????? \ 
I will 
We could have had it all , \ 
( You're gonna wish you never had met me ) , \ 
Rolling in the deep , \

You had my heart inside of your hands , \ 
And you played it to the beat , \

Single = Never having to explain where you have been , and why you were there so long . 
relationships are like a broken vase , sometimes it's better to throw them away than try to piece them back together . 
3 bloody noses in a 2 days time period = not good . :/

A true friend doesn't care when you're broke , being a witch , what you weigh , what you look like , if your house is a mess , what you drive , about your past , or if your family is filled with CRAZY people . Your conversations pick up where they left off , even if they have been months apart . They love you for who you are and don't judge you . Re-post if you have at least one true friend . they will know who they are . 
Ugh made 250 stinkin notecards today ... Well , I think imma be a lamer and call it a night . G'nite! 
Dear God , I come to You as humbly as I know how . I confess my sins , those known and unknown . Lord You know I am not perfect and I fall short everyday of my life , but I want to take time out to say Thank You for Your mercy . Thank You for my health , my family and my friends , the roof over my head , food on my table , and everything I have . RE-post if GOD has blessed you in any way

Greatest man in History , Jesus , had no servants , yet they called him Master , had no degree , yet they called him Teacher , had no medicines , yet they called him Healer , had no army , yet kings feared him , won no military battles , yet he conquered the world , committed no crime , yet they crucified him ... He was buried in a tomb , yet he lives today . Repost if you believe in your heart HE is the REASON for the SEASON 
\I am closer than I think . \"" 
Hi Lord , its me . Things are getting bad here , gas prices are too high , no jobs , food and heating cost too high . I know some have taken you out of our schools , government & even Christmas . But Lord I'm asking you to come back and re-bless < PROPFEMALE > , we really need you . Thanks Lord , I love you ! The Lord says when 2 or more are gathered in My Name , there I will be also !!! Let's see how far this goes . Re-Post .... 
Oh gosh , Why do I always feel bad when I have to let down a guy easily . Especially the nice , sweet ones that I'm not at all interested in like that ... gahhh . I hate it .

What is your < PROPMALE > Wedding guest name ? Start with either Lord or Lady . Your first name is one of your grandparents names . Your surname is the name of your first pet , double-barreled with the name of the street you grew up on . Have fun ! 
I was raised to say please and thank you , to have respect for my elders , lend a helping hand to those who were in need , hold the door for the person behind me , say excuse me when it was needed , and to love people for who they are , not for\ 
what you can get from them ! I was also taught to treat people the way I want to be treated !!!........ If you were raised this way too , please re-post

Neither genius , fame , nor love show the greatness of the soul . Only kindness can do that . Kindness is not meant to be payed back , it is meant to be passed on .

The problem with the world is that the intelligent people are full of doubts while the stupid ones are full of confidence .
