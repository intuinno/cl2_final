is writing a poem about a friggalickachupachup ( pronounced frig-guh-lik-uh-choop-uh-choop ) . 

Apparently I'm not American because I've never had a sloppy < PROPFIRST > , and I'm not French because I hate mayonaise . So I'm ... Native American ? 
When's the next family reunion ?!? 
Rush concert . Ruuush coooncert . Rush concert ! Rush concert !!! RUSH CONCERT !!!!!!! Do you not see the importance of those two words being in one sentence ?!?

\Holy shizzle ! I feel a hair-flip comin ' on ! * flips hair while humming * That one was for you . \ " Hahaha I'm watching Ask Swifty :) " 
When life gives me lemons , I make BEEF STEW ! 
If anyone else voted for me , I am not going to be happy . 
AMAZING GAME . We won , I marched , and had to do a redicuous dance . I am SOOO worn out . I LOVE BAND ! :D 
Eragon the movie is a disgrace to < PROPFIRST > Paolini's wonderful book series . Shame on you , Stefen Fangmeier . And shame to the one who hired an unexperienced director such as Fangmeier . 
Turn off your swag , pull your pants up , AND WALK FASTER !!! 
I want a jar of dirt . 
Have you ever looked out into the distance and thought you saw a beautilful part of nature , but then got closer and realized it was just litter ? :/ 
My binder bit me today . 
GUESS WHO'S HOME ?!? NICOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLE !!! YAAAY ! 
I totally just figured out what I want to be when I grow up ! Okay , so we have professional football players and professional cheerleaders , right ? I'm going to be in a PROFESSIONAL MARCHING BAND ! Hopefully when this happens the Rams won't suck anymore . And yes , I am a band nerd :) 
< PROPMALE > Miller is freaking awesome . I LOVE MY CLARINET BUDDIES !

Sectionals tomorrow ... hopefully nothing dies this time ... 
Dad : \Lindsay Lohan was such a sweet little girl ... What happened to her ? \ " \ 
My dog is too fat to lick herself . Hilarious ? I think so . :) 
Jacob : \Every time you say popo 
I learned two very important things today : One : < PROPMALE > Miller can fly . Two : If a teacher tells him to dance , he will dance . 
Happy birthday , Carlin Black !!! :D 
I would very much appreciate it if you prayed for my mommy . 
Awesome game . Don't know the score , don't know who won , but I had a great time with my amazing friends :) You know who you are . * Cough cough * Carlin Black ! * Cough cough * < PROPMALE > Flashflood Godbey ! * Cough * Wow , I need better allergy medicine ... 
Going to the game on Friday , woohoo ! Spending hours with my soul brother , my nerd , and my newest friend ? Can't wait ! 
For the most part , last night was awesome !!! I got to spend some quality time with my favorite people :) It was amazing . 
Dear < PROPFEMALE > , Please come back to life and back to our family . You will always be the best we could've ever hoped for , and I miss you . Love , < PROPFEMALE > 
I MISS MY BAND KIDS !!! Why does Texas have to be so far away ? :( 
I just endured a whole day without < PROPMALE > Miller . It was horrible . :( And that's how it's going to be for the rest of the schoolyear . 
What do I do when I'm off school ? I watch < PROPMALE>'s World . 
Had an interesting and somewhat confusing dream last night ... 
MY MOTHER IS STILLL PLAYING CHRISTMAS MUSIC . SOMEONE EITHER RESCUE ME OR SHOOT ME . 
A lot of kids are already making plans for tomorrow because they assume we are going to have a snow day . I hope Mother Nature teaches them a lesson and proves them wrong >:) 
I have the best friends in the entire world . Thank you , guys , for being so awesome ; I don't know what I'd do without you . I love you all so much :) 
I am quite zeal about the upcoming social endeavor I shall partake in . In less civilized words , I am so freakin ' excited to get out of this house and see my friends !!! 
Two clarinet women \molesting\ " < PROPMALE > Miller in a car ... that's about as biscuit as it gets . " 
Wow , just spent an hour and a half writing in my handy-dandy purple notebook . So much for writer's block ! My creative imagination is back with a vengence ! 
Why have I been craving nothing but cream cheese for the past few days ?!? 
Opperation meet the parents : overall success ( not so great when dad was showing the pictures ) . Best night ever , other than the Kansas City football game . 
I will happily hold your Canine American . 
If I were the little mermaid , < PROPMALE > Miller would be < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > Flashflood Godbey would be Flounder , and Carlin Black would be Scuttle . 
If we have another snowday I AM GOING TO LOSE IT . Seriously . Send me back to school or I will kill someone . 
You have one of the least subtle tastes in jewelry I have ever seen in a woman ! 
I can't understand for my life , but I don't want to ask . 
Lima < PROPFEMALE > Kilo < PROPFEMALE > Tango Hotel < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Tango < PROPFEMALE > Tango Uniform < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Foxtrot Yankee < PROPFIRST > Uniform Uniform November < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Tango < PROPFEMALE > November < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Tango . 
Just got three quotes for my Honors English II writing prompt ; one from < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , one from Gandhi , and one from < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > . This is going to be a great paper . 
My name is < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Smith , I am 14 years old , I am a girl , and I am in an extremely good mood ! :D 
Look , he's crawling up my wall , Black and hairy , very small , Now he's up above my head , Hanging by a little thread , < PROPMALE > THE SPIDER ! 
Happy 3rd birthday , < PROPFIRST > !!! :D 
That test was easier than the girls on Jersey Shore . Honors Algebra II , here I come . 
Saturday was okay ; it was fun hanging out with band kids all day , but I totally ruined my ensemble and I had to wear a dress :P 
I'm suffering from Dillender withdrawals :( I miss my crazy cousins ! 
So let me get this straight : < PROPMALE > is my mama , < PROPFIRST > is his father , making him my grandpa ( eew , I'm dating my grandpa ! ) , < PROPMALE > is my older brother and ex-wife whom I had Wolfe with , and < PROPMALE > is my son whose father is someone else ? What a weird family tree ... 
A man walks in to a bar and asks for a glass of water . The bartender gets a shotgun and shoots , barely missing the man . The man says thank you , leaves a tip , and walks out . If you can tell me why he said thank you and left a tip , you are a beast . 
Dear Missouri , \ 
I know you hate being coorperative and predictable . I do too . But could you really not wait for Spring Break to be over before you give us snow ? It was so nice yesterday . Mother Nature must be PMSing becuase I've never seen the weather this bipolar before . Bottom line , please , please , PLEASE make the weather nice again as soon as possible ! \ 
Love , \ 
< PROPFEMALE > 
I need a good profile picture ... 
I kinda miss the good ol ' days with just Kelpo , Gingey , Blonde Emo , and me . Where has the time gone ? 
Huh , and I thought my computer couldn't get any slower ... I was wrong . >:( 
INHERITANCE IS COMING OUT ON NOVEMBER 8TH ! I WANT IT SOOO BAD !!! 
My sister just got her dress , and she looks like Prom Night < PROPFEMALE > . It's mildly disturbing . 
Seeing JFK's brain spraying out of his head is going to haunt me for quite a while ... poor guy :( 
now has Moving Pictures on her iPod ! Thank you , thank you , THANK YOU RUTLEDGES !!! You have just made my day ! 
Two words : Tay Zonday . ( Youtube him . ) 
Just a few more days until I can have chocolate ... as Veruca Salt once said , \Make time go faster ! \"" 
During a tornado warning , what do I do ? Run upstairs and grab my guitar and clarinet as soon as my mother's back is turned . 
CHOOOOOOOOOOOOOCOLAAAAAAAAAATE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :D ( Oh yeah , and Happy Easter , everybody . ) 
I had a great time last night . Especially when CD started the tickle fight , and then < PROPFIRST > joined in ! :D I love my family . 
Whoever said Mondays suck apparently hasn't met < PROPFIRST > Overton , because yesterday was beyond awesome . :) 
Remember , kids , < PROPMALE > Potter day on Monday !!! :D Whoever doesn't think I'm dressing up is a fool ... a fool , I say ! 
All I want is a black < PROPMALE > Shepherd named Sirius . And a < PROPFEMALE > Retriever named Atticus . And a Chocolate Lab named Berlioz . And a pet Grizzly Bear named Jethro . Is that too much to ask ? 
Words can't explain how happy I am :)
