I understand people who don't want to be lonely , but I refuse to believe that staying with someone that makes you miserable is the best option . Seriously . 
Sometimes when I'm out , like at a store or somewhere with lots of people , I look around for things I could use as weapons in case a zombie outbreak happens .
