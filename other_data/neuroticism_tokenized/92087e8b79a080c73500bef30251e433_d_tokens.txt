Down's syndrome is not an illness because people with down's syndrome do not need medication to make them better , what they need is the right to be accepted by society the same as everyone else ... 93% of my friends will NOT copy this ...

Now I need all my teacher friends to explain this to me . I was going through < PROPFIRST>' papers and found some science questions and they were related to heredity . Now that is exactly what I am teaching my 7th graders . How is it that my 2nd grade son knows more about heredity than the students I teach who are at least 5 years older than him . Things that make you go HMMMMMMM ! 
Before you were conceived I wanted you . Before you were born I loved you . Before you were an hour old I would die for you . This is the miracle of life . Put this on your status if you have children you love more than life itself ?

I might not be the most beautiful , or the sexiest , nor do i\ 
have the perfect body . I might not be the 1st choice , but I'm a GREAT \ 
choice . I don't pretend to be someone I'm not because I'm too good at\ 
being ME . I might not be proud of some of the thing's I've done in \ 
the past but I'm proud of who I am today ! Take me as I am , or watch \ 
... me as .... I walk away . Post this as your \ 
status if you love being you !! ;D

First day of school was great ! I don't think it could have gone much more smoother . I think it will be a great year . 
I want to thank everyone that wished me a happy birthday including my mafia family ! You really made my day . God has truly blessed me with a wonderful family and terrific friends . 
So , I'm sitting here thinking about Monday and hoping it will be a little less chaotic than last week . NO MORE FIGHTS ! I still am bruised from last Monday's!

Well , the presents have been opened , the boys can't stop playing their XBox 360 , and I am exhausted ! But I wouldn't have it any other way . < PROPFEMALE > Christmas to all of my Facebook family 
Friends , I encourage ALL to change your profile photo to the image of the MAN who had COURAGE despite to STAND up ~ < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > Jr. ! If we can change it to a cartoon character or to our favorite sports team , I was thinking , what would it hurt to give the spotlight to MLK for 72 hrs to show we APPRECIATE his National Day ? I challenge you to encourage your friends to do the same by posting & sharing this message !
