MOM FINALLY GOT HER NEW VEHICLE NO MORE JUNKER ASTRO < PROPFIRST > !! YESS !!! 
WELCOME TO THE UNITED STATES OF < PROPFEMALE > Press 1 for English . Press 2 to disconnect until you learn to speak English . And remember only two defining forces have ever offered to die for you , JESUS CHRIST and the < PROPFEMALE > N SOLIDER . One died for your soul , the other for your freedom . If you agree ... copy and paste in your status . 
is extremely disliking < PROPMALE > for he knows what makes me mad but yet he still does it . 
is wonderin WHY ARE ALL THE SAD COUNTRY SONGS ON . ( it stinks that they're good too ) 
SNO DRIFT RALLY WAS AWESOME !!! 
Just had one of the unluckiest day in his life and now needs to write a note to avoid any dates on Valentines day 
feels like having a cookie ... when doesn't he feel like having one is the better question to ask 
just had a guy by the name of < PROPMALE > from Mexico call and ask if i was the < PROPMALE > from the subway commercial ... 2nd time he called does anyone know how i can get the number blocked ? if so let me know thanks . 
Tomorrow's ugly sweater day what sweater should i wear ... how about an italian sports car shirt :) 
It was a good 13 years with ya < PROPMALE > , R.I.P. Pooch ( A.K.A. Sarge ) 
For anyone that are in favor of all gun legislation that puts more laws on restricting guns because you say we don't have enough . i got a disc that has every gun law in MICHIGAN and ONLY MICHIGAN and it is 269 PAGES . JUST FOR MICHIGAN . ok so if other states are similar then there are about 9416-16140 pages of laws about guns in the U.S. so don't tell me there isn't a lot of laws about guns 
is really bored ... and wonderin if yooker is orginally polish or not ... Caplis looked it up and will ask him 
Just got back from his awesome weekend of ridin the quad getting full of mud , shootin < PROPMALE > pigeons with the 12 guage , and getting hit in the face with the < PROPMALE > pigeons . Yup when it's all said and done it was fantastic 
Why is T-Bone steak considered one of the \best deals\ " when it comes to the steak world ?! ya it's good but when you buy one you buy for 50% meat and 50% fat . WHATS WITH THAT ! I DEMAND MORE MEAT !!! " 
By far one of the best analogies i've heard \He's a few fries short of bein a mcd's happy meal\ " LMAO " 
O so much i want to punch < PROPFIRST > ( oldest brother ) 
Pepper-jack flavored cheezits+pepper-jack cheese+ deer sausage+hot mustard = AWESOMENESS 
You know it's bad when a car company won't even sell their own cars in their own country ( Ford Focus Wagon CURSE U FORD and you wonder why ur goin down the drain ... deserve it if you wont sell a nice car like that here ) 
Track for guys started today and what a great day it was to go for a run 
Loves watching people who think their top dog get tired after an easy workout 
Yesterday was the first Full laser tag game i enjoyed EVER ( lots of targets , no d-bags , not enough friends there though unfornately ) 
One of my biggest pet peves is when everyone but a few people is busting THEIR A ** and the ones that DON'T WORK HARD are bein the cockiest . Whether it's track or actual work in the working world you shouldn't be a COCKY S.O.B. IF YOU DON'T WORK AT IT ! 
Has no stinkin idea why but just got really bummed out as soon as i got home 
Just got back from a Kalkaska Gun and Knife show . IT WAS AWESOME except i didn't have the money to buy anything i liked ( which was pretty much half the stuff :D boy i wish i had that kind of money ) 
it makes me sad to see celebrities driving NICE classic cars and they don't even do any of the work to restore it ( ex . < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > and his 68 ' Mustang . ) 
hate's writing resamays ( i know i spelled it wrong but i don't know how to put the things over the letters ) 
Finally finished wiring our trailer with new lights . TOOK ME AND MY DAD 9 HOURS to do Because we thought we had bad grounds when it was actually the plug we use to connect the trailer's lights to the circuit that the truck uses to power the trailers lights . Sux that we wasted so much time when it was something that we didn't even know was broken and can't fix in our driveway . 
my dad just got a new 2010 CanAm 800 EFI XT Outlander with pretty much everything on it , has 71 hp ( which is 2x higher than any other atv in the same size bracket ) and can go from 0-30 faster than you can count from 0- 1.5 ( i am dead serious this is the only atv that i've ridden that accelerated so fast the first time i rode it the first 2 words that ever came out of my mouth were HOLY S***T !!!! and i about did it ) 
mad that dad's new ATV almost paid 13 grand for it it and they FORGOT AN AIR FILTER . the worst part was we didn't realize it until after a 3 hour ride on some of the dustiest trails in michigan behind 4 other quads . Hope it didn't hurt the engine too bad but knows that the engine is probably damaged . But HOW do you forget an AIR FILTER . 
Hates it when for no apparent reason gets really pissed off and cant calm down worst part is i don't even know why i get pissed i just do 
Knows he has a good weekend when you go through about 11 gallons of gas and the only reason you came home 3 hours early is because you ran out of gas in his toy :D

Has no idea why but has a new sudden urge to go and shoot my dad's Remmington 700 , His Replica 1874 Sharps in 45-90 . Nothing like the smell of gun powder :D 
Liked track practice today it was just fun too me . Chasin that tennis ball around was a lot of fun too . People don't understand why and theysay it's weird but they've never tried it . They ask why i do it and i say it's fun they don't know why and i don't know why either all i know is that it's fun 
Swear he was sitting next to a hound eating pasta today at dinner . But it wasnt a hound to my amazement .

Best practice today SANDIES HILL WORKOUT it's so much fun to run up the hill and leave the others in a rooster tail of sand :D 
the funny thing is the ak 47 existed during ww2 but it was just AK , the ak 47 is the 47th version of the orrignial ak <<<< someone who knows nothing about an ak 47 47 was when it was made ( 1947 ) not the 47th version

Nothing like an 8 mile run at 7:00 to wake you up . 
So if a fools paradise is a wise man's hell . wouldn't that make a wise man's paradise a fool's headache ? 
Realized one reason why i loved running cause i can talk to someone who will always listen and not ignore him because there is someone else they would rather listen to . Too bad the person is himself 
Knows he's a runner because he got excited when he got a new pair of shoes 
My dad today asked me what i wanted for a graduation gift . i didn't know so he proposed to take a week off after i graduate to go to Tennessee to ride ATV's at Ride < PROPMALE > blue .

Shot offhand as good with the target facing backwards as he did with it facing the right way . maybe i should start shooting them backwards from bow on ? 
Anyday that his mom's world famous sugar cookies are made is a good day 
my mom got a \fortune fish\ " which it does like 6 different things to tell you what kind of a person u are and the one i got is it said i am a fickle person . " 
Everybody wants to go to heaven\

State meet was really cool . Congrats to < PROPMALE > for making it there and running well . Also needless to say seeing a highschooler jump 7 FEET 2 INCHES WAS AWESOME !!

TRACK STARTS MONDAY I CAN'T WAIT !!! gonna be awesome year this year . 
. ;;;...;.;;;....;.;..;;;...;.;;;....;;..;..;;.;...;;;;;..;.;.;.;.;;;;..;.;.;.;.;;..;;.;...;.;.; . 
Distance runners in track make sure to bring clothes to run outside on monday 
YESS TRACK SEASON STARTED !!! First practice wasnt long enough for my liking but that's why a second run was ran . Not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing but during our practice a teammate gave me the middle finger after i told him good job . I'll take it that he's jealous of my speed but i do hate being disrespected like that . It was uncalled for and unreasonable . 
60 DEGREES OUT !! perfect running weather today 
well ... my brother is in front of the door to our house and he isn't moving fast enough so i can get inside so instintively i called him fat . After we got in we weighed ourselves and needless to say it's going to be hard calling him fat when i'm almost 10 pounds heavier than he is lol 
so today i got home and i was just dead tired . and i now know why mr. jacobs likes naps so much
