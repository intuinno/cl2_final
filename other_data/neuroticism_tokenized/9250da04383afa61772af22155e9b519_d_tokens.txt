I have a confession .... on this night at 12:01 a.m. I will drag a cold sharp blade over my warm upper lip , and soon after I will have officially left the hipster mustache world behind .

Thanks for all of the good times - Mr. November : \all March Long . \""

I am raising $250 for the MS bike ride to help fight multiple sclerosis . All donations will go to the non-profit group the National MS Society , who will help fund research towards a cure .

Hey everyone ! Thanks to your support I hit my goal for the MS fundraiser ! Now all I need to do is wait for winter to go into hibernation so that I can start getting into shape !
