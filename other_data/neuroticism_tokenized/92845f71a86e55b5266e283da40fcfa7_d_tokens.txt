Funny story ... I found my box of contacts I thought I lost 4 months ago today in my laptop bag where I put them for Thankgiving Break just in case something wierd happened . I've been wearing glasses for 2 months , I have two boxes on the way , and I made my mom use expedite shipping to mail me a trial pair so I had some for the musical . All this , because this dumbass thought he lost it ... :P 
was busy for the past 9 1/2 hours with break for food . The musical is over why is this happening ? 
\you know if you add an \ " I\ " before jif and spell the whole thing backwards you get fiji\ " ... my random thought of the day "

Wednesday recital = ... ugh ! I'm so glad that's over ! 
Well it's a good day i'd say ... No classes , I'm not worried about juries as much anymore , solid gpa , I get to go home in less than a week , and over 500,000 points in bejeweled ! :D 
Celebration = Badass ! 
Cannot wait to get home !!! One more then it's off to go sing barbershop and relax for four months !!!

Couldn't sleep but just discovered the beastiness of Pandora !!! :D What a great way to get over waking up at like 5 in the morning 
My phone is finally working !!! :D 
finally experienced the mind-raping power of Inception ! That was awesome ! 
The best thing about driving home with your best friend's parents who are white - the strange looks people give you in a gas station . 
YEA !!! Move in day and I get to see everyone !!! BOO !!! Waking up at 5:30 in the morning . 
Settled in the Bearcat Country . This year will be awesome !!! :D 
I officially hate sight reading ... and I still have another audition Monday with sight reading on piano . Life is great ... 
And now ... the anticipation ... the final list goes up tomorrow ! 
So pretty much every status on my < PROPFEMALE > says something about Game Day . So in that respect ... GO BEARCATS !!! 
< PROPFEMALE > ... yeah my soul has is kinda gone ... because it's now officially sold to show choir !!!! :D 
Well after tonight i will never think of marshmallows or ice cream sandwiches the same again . But it was still hilariously fantastic !!! :D 
So the most productive day ever ... waking up , watching Avatar ( well most of it ) , taking a nap , eating chicken noodle soup while watching a three hour futurama marathon , then Aziz Ansan and to top it off a < PROPFIRST > Carstensen investigation after seeing a Comedy Central commercial for a website for men who like Cougars .... No further comments ... 
So ... In CIT at this moment ... \ 
Do I care that I'm on Facebook ? \ 
I think ... no .

Rain ... ( 4:18:40 ) oh ... is it stopping ? ( 4:19 ) It'll start again in like three minutes . 
Dear Computers and Info Tech professor , \ 
We are in college , therefore we have the < PROPFEMALE > of NOT staying in class when we take a test that's only 10 minutes long and have no other assignments to do . Staying for 40 minutes after the test is over is really uncool ! \ 
Thank you FB for letting me vent\ 
< PROPFIRST > Andrews 
Facebook , movies , and ice cream make doing homework so much harder . Who invented these wonderful distractions ?! 
Quelf + Awesome Friends + mouth written poetry = fantastic night !!! :D 
20 people in gospel choir today !!! OH YEAH !!! :D What a good way to end a LONG day . 
Movies and Ice cream ... I see good things in the future :D 
I think robot unicorn attack is a virus ( not a bad one ) that very few people are immune to and the people that aren't immune are most likely playing it ... right now . :P 
Madraliers tour = Awesome ! :D And I guess my name is Abu now ... 
Tower Choir = BA ! Simply put . 
NWMSU Madraliers Concert is tonight !!! It will be awesome !!! Who's excited ... this guy !
