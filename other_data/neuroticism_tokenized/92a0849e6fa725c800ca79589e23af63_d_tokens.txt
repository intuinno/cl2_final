I have no clue what to ask for my b-day 

I am putting up a ladies/gentlemans bet . the bet is that nobody can listen to the tune of shiping up to boston and find it catchy . 
cant sleep , college tommorow 
first day , kinda nice :) 
computer went nuts today , but works now ... taking it in at thanksgiving 
sending this thing to apple to get fixed ... if i can remember the number . 
got a care package from grandma a few days ago , with an apple the size of a softball ! 
found shockers are NOT discontinued ! Loved them as a kid ! 
man , comm homework is so dull ! Nothing but researching a speech topic and writing an outline . 
scratch that , CALC is worst . Very tricky . Might just drop ... 
hilighter was pretty fun . 
just great , bike got stolen ... at least i dont have to worry about bringing it home now . 
thanks for the care package , perked me up after worrying about my calc test . Thanks so much . 
look out < PROPFIRST > , the < PROPFEMALE>'s gonna eat you ! 
FREEZING !!! Windows broken and letting snow in . 
got DESTROYED by my calc final . GHF , done with monmouth for a while . Bring on the cruise ! 
guess even college gets a snow day , even if its not too bad out now 
my printer is possessed . tried to print something before class , wont print . come back , the second i say print , it starts printing what i wanted ... FROM AN HOUR AGO ! 
anyone see jump city seattle ? those guys sure look like they have fun ... 
this is one sweet storm !
