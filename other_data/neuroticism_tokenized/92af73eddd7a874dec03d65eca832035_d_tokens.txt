ok so facebook is being rather .... odd to me lately please forgive me for the weird stuff that has been going on with my account this is my main account i would really appirciate it if it stayed that way 
Gods guiding me and speaking to me but that still doesnt make this any easier . 
i dont see why it isnt the way it used to be . i dont see why it gets harder everytime it happens . i dont know why i keep doing it . i know the product but i need to tell myself that i just need me and i just need to leave it at that . its just gonna get harder . im not looking forward to anything in the future . to where i was all about the future now i just hope that the future doesnt kill me . 
thinks pet cemetary is a disturbing movie . 
thank god for all my friends and my youth pastor . especially my youth pastor . 
you guys know what hurts ? 2nd degree sunburn . i have blisters on my shoulders . 
singing and getting ready to play diablo 2 . < PROPFIRST > if you get on while i have this status . TYPE ME WITH YOUR BATTLE . NET INFO !!!!

my mom is the biggest nerd i know . 
life is like walking down the street . your walking and everything is fine . then the clouds get black and the sky gets red and satan drops the ground into a canyon with pointy rocks at the bottom and you think \this will take months to get through\ " but luckly i have my secret wepon . God is there to tell me \ " I am with you every step of the way to warn you about the dangers . \"" 
well the canyon that Satan has dropped for me is difficult to manuveor and im not out yet but God showed me the elevator . 
well got back from youth camp . god is really growing in me . i can feel myself becoming more of a man but i am not yet a man . i havent gone through my own rite of passage yet . when im a man god will be able to look at me and say . \i am proud of this man that i have created \"" 
My secret side I keep hid under lock and key\ 
I keep it caged but I \ 
can't control it\ 
' Cause if I let him out he'll tear me up , break me \ 
down\ 
Why won't somebody come and save me from this , make it end ? \ 
\ 
I\ 
feel it deep within , it's just beneath the skin\ 
I must confess that I\ 
feel like a monster\ 
I hate what I've become , the nightmare's just \ 
begun\ 
I must confess that I feel like a monster 
I'm so exhausted from helping people . and i forgot it is sunday so i am late for church ! 
I dont really enjoy being sick ... =( 
Dear God , Thanks . Sincerely , < PROPMALE > . 
Listening to Skillet . Being sick . Nothing new . 
I feels like poop . 
Youth Group was so much fun tonight . Too bad I couldn't go to Old Chicago though . I felt God tonight . He is going to do great things in my life in the next few weeks I can feel it ! 
My video games got surprisingly boring . sitting by myself at the computer is a lot more fun . 
I dont feel like playing video games ... I dont feel like sitting at the computer ... I feel like playing with the many friends I dont have . * sigh * 
\Comatose I'll never wake up without an overdose OF YOU . I dont wanna live . I dont wanna breathe . ' < PROPMALE > I feel you next to me . \ " For some reason im down on life . " 
Good Night FaceBook . Perhaps tomorrow will be a better day . 
Good Morning FaceBook . I feel tired and a little upset this morning . I kinda wish my past would just .... disappear . Like Hudini . 
I'm feeling better . Tired . But better . 
I had a pretty good day . Tomorrow will be better . I get to < PROPFEMALE > out with a friend . A good friend . 
It makes me upset when people generalize christians . We are not a general population . I was just on Youtube and someone said something about having a problem with people who like skillet just because they believe in God . Then went on to ask the question \what if you were in a car wreck bleeding to death . What do you say ? oh God please dont let me die . " 
Today is going to be a good day . I hope that it is at least . I get to < PROPFEMALE > out with 2 friends today . WOOT ! EPIC ! 
I had fun today . No drama to deal with . But i got to meet people in a different way today . Not in like a standerized this is how your supposed to act way . In they're natural states . 
I'm tired . Goodnight Facebook people . 
Guys I'm tired . 
If you like my status I'll tell you one thing I like about you , one thing I dislike about you , my first impression of \ 
you , and a confession about you . This never happens . It will be up for exactly 24 hours if you get a < PROPMALE > . I suggest you take it . 
Good night Facebook . Maybe tomorrow . 
Good night < PROPFIRST > . I'll most likely kill you in the morning . 
I'm exhausted . I helped Pastor Burgess around the church yard today . It was hard work . And we cleaned out the trash can outside . Earwigs and spiders EVERYWHERE ! I'm kinda glad its over . But I had fun spending time with Pastor . =D 
Sometimes . I wish things . Right now I wish I had the time of day . 
Dude . I don't have to be here right now ! 
Why .... Am I so angry ... 
I'm feeling better now . 
Good night facebook . I'm exhausted . 
Well guys . Good morning . I wish Lab4an , < PROPFEMALE > , and the rest of the Deboer family a safe trip to seattle . 
Muahahahahaha . 
Ugh guys . I'm sick . Doesn't that suck ? Sleep . Sleep is good . 
Good morning Facebook . I'm feelin a little better today . 
I lost the game . 
Please pray for me guys . I'm feeling worse now . I'm still feeling quite sick . I will be at church tomorrow . 
AAAAH ! MY TOOTH HURTS ! 
\You got some < PROPFEMALE > weiners and some little nuts . \ " Master of Disguise . Gosh that part cracks me up . " 
So how many times does it take to fall to actually learn the lesson ? 
/Shutdown Computer . Night everyone . 
I'm excited for an exciting Youth Group tomorrow ! =D 
\Video gaming is staying up until 3 in the morning to get a trophy that isn't real .... but is . \ " Some guy at E3 said this . I really like it . =D " 
Almost time for Youth Group . Got a good feeling about tonight . =D 
Well Youth Group was so much fun tonight ! =D

If you believe in Jesus Christ , put this on your wall . Don't ignore this because The Bible says : If you deny Him , He will deny you in front of His Father in the Gates of Heaven . This is the simplest test , If you love God and you are not ashamed of it :) 
Got a haircut . 
Had a great time at devi's party it was so much fun ! 
Officially . I have to get a new bike . Or even one from the thrift store something ! My bike officially deserves to be in the trash . 
I need church every day . 
We're not done here yet ! 
My brain is tired but it doesn't understand that to sleep it has to stop thinking ! 
I had the weirdest dream last night ............ You guys don't understand . It was pretty weird . Not like my pants are trying to me weird . But like against my morals weird . 
Does satan make us doubt ? 
Thank the Lord . Jesus , God Almighty . For granting us so much . 
HA IM WATCHING TALE OF TWO CITIES ! 
IF DREAMS CAME TRUE I MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BETTER MAN . \ 
IF DREAMS CAME TRUE YOU MIGHT HAVE SET ME FREE . \ 
BUT GOD IS KIND , FOR YOU HE HAD A BETTER PLAN\ 
AND SAVED YOU FROM THE PAIN OF LOVING ME . \ 
AND EVEN IF I'D NOT SURRENDERED LONG AGO\ 
ALL YOU CAN EVER DO FOR ME YOU'VE DONE . 
< PROPFIRST > talked about Acts 2:22 yesterday . The Lord wanted me to tell you all that we all have a little < PROPFIRST > in us . We will all someday speak up and stand up for our savior the way < PROPFIRST > did in < PROPMALE > . 
If you're reading this , whether or not we speak often , please post a \ 
comment of the 1st memory of us together that pops in your head .... When \ 
you've finished , you should post this as your status to see what people \ 
remember about you ! :D

I don't think you guys know how great Labanator DeBoer really is . Do you ? 
Time ..... GO FASTER !!!!! 
The Lord has been watching me forever but now he is watching over me with the eye of the hawk . I will defeat my sin . Thank you Jesus for being so forgiving . 
If you're on my friend list your there for a reason . That reason could be because we knew each other in the past we still know each other or we're destined to meet in the future . I just wanted you all to know that I love you with God's love as does God himself love you . 
God . Thank You but now you're confusing me . 
\The greatest among you must be a servant . But those who exalt themselves will be humbled . And those who humble themselves will be exalted\ " < PROPMALE > 23:11 -12 "

If\ 
you believe in Jesus Christ put this on your wall . Don't just ignore \ 
this because theBible says if you deny him , he will deny you in front of\ 
his father at the gates of Heaven . This is a simple test . If you love \

I've found a new found joy in helping my friends move their stuff . It's no fun toting around your own junk for a while but it's way more fun to tot around your friends junk . =D 
I'll become , even more undignified than this . Some may say its foolishness , but I'll become even more undignified than this . Leave my pride by my side .

For everyone who cares enough about me to read my status every now and then . I am human . I fear . I cry . When you cut me I bleed . And I can't do it all on my own .

I like being able to change my status from my phone . Haha ! 
Greatest man in history , named Jesus , had no servants , yet they called him Master . Had no degree , yet they called him Teacher . Had no medicine , yet they called him Healer . He had no army , yet kings feared Him . He won no military battles , yet He conquered the world . He committed no crime , yet they crucified Him . He was buried in a tomb , yet He lives today . Re-post if you believe with all your heart . < PROPFEMALE > Christmas ? 
Woot go CHRISTmas . < PROPFEMALE > CHRISTmas . 
Just got home from Altitude . I'm really tired and I think I don't want school tomorrow . It should snow as much down here as it did in the mountains . Then they can't take us to school AHAHAHAHAH ! Although all those kids who are home schooled would be kinda at a lose .......... OH WELL ! God worked so much through me this weekend I feel it's not even close to over yet . 
Good night Facebook and Facebookers . Don't be slackers guys . Get in the word ! Love you all . 
Guys , I think it's time . God has spoken into my life today ! I prayed about something and he gave me an answer TODAY ! I prayed he would give my guidance . I planned to leave the choir because I felt it was beginning to hinder my life with God . Someone told me that I was not bringing what I learned from God into the choir . Thus I was feeling far away from him . Praise him for who he is !
