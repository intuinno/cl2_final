Just got finished painting some of his dwarf blood bowl team . Generally I don't think my stuff is all that special looking , but I have to say , the dwarves look pretty damn rad . 

Struggling with doing the bases on my new dwarf team . Hopefully they will start turning out pretty rad . I guess I'll know for sure tommorrow . Someone should come show me how to not suck at modelling the bases * pokes < PROPFIRST > really damn hard . * 
Just 2 and a half dwarves left , plus bases , and i'll finally be done with a team for the first time in like ........ ever . The bases look incredibly rad , I couldn't be happier with how everything has turned out . 
Hot damn , all dwarves finally finished and based . Sweet Christmas thats stupid fresh . Now to just finish the other 4 teams ........ 
Feels old now that he's seen his nieces and nephews all grown up .... complete with facial hair and being out of high school ..... 
Good news and bad news today . The lump that got removed from my tongue was apparently cancerous , but it looks like they cut it all out . They don't know if its spread anywhere else so I have to go back every month so they can root around and see if there is any more . Thank you everyone who kept me in their thoughts and prayers . 
Ima fag .
