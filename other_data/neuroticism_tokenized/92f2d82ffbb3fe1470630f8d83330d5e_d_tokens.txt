Back home from a very busy weekend and very much enjoying my own space . 

We are definitley in the Last Days . People get ready . 
One child screaming at the top of her lungs , Professinal Wrestling ( like there is such a thing ) in the background , two out of three kids still in pajamas . Oh , yeah !!! Living the life here in Springfield . 
Just got home from church . Tried a new one today . Really liked it and < PROPFIRST > LOVED it !!! Hmmmmm may need to consider this . 
Texas Roadhouse , old car show , < PROPMALE > creek battlefield , and shopping are in my very near future . Can't wait !!! 
Think I'll go to my favorite quilt store tomorrow and get some fabric I've been eyeing to make a quilt for my sweet , handsome hubby . 
I'll spending the week getting ready for < PROPMALE>'s big one year birthday party on Saturday !!! My sweet doll baby is going to be a toddler . Sniffle ...... Sniffle . 
I love rainy days . So peaceful and quiet . 
House full of crazy kids and I keep trying to get to my happy place but have yet to be successful . :) 
< PROPFIRST > picked his first watermelon off the vine this evening . It weighed a whopping 21 pounds . The thing looked a huge but still not quite ripe . 
In the zone . Tackeled most of my housework already and ready to attack the laundry !!! WooHoo !! 
I am just beginning to understand the very serious task I have as a parent to train my children to be people of absolute truth and integrity . Oh , Lord !! I need your help !! Please , Please help me to raise up children who yearn to live life of strong char 
< PROPFIRST > was singing his version of Awesome God in the shower . It was God is an Awesome God He reigns . He lives up above in heaven . He is very powerful . He threw in some oooo's and ahhh's . Quite lovely , child . Sing on . 
Rainy here in Springfield . Just finished watching Retrun To Neverland with my little trio . So nice to just sit and relax and snuggle my little angels . 
Have to let go of a very dear child who I have been babysitting . It makes my heart HURT !!! 
Done babysitting for the week . Two free days comng up with my kiddos !! YES !!!!!!! 
Donuts , the park , and the library all in one morning !!! Good times ... hanging out with my babies . Time to get the housework done !! Yippeee !! 
Help , Help !! < PROPFIRST > is trying to give himself a hair cut !! Oh this cannot happen 
What a fun day !!! We took the kids to the lake and then to the Butterfly Palace in Branson . Our faces are a little red but tra la la la good times !!! 
Nap time . Not going so well for my littlest guy !!! 
Reading the book Blue like Jazz . It will make you think . 
Just got home from date night . Ahhh . First time we have had alone time since < PROPMALE > has been born . So nice . 
Anyone have a good recipe for apple cobler ? 
Trying to decide if I should start in on another book or work on the quilting project that I began several months ago . Hmmmm . 
Tired and a little on the grouchy side today . 
Woohoo !! Looking forward to church tonight . Northpoint is starting Northpoint university where we can enroll in all kinds of different classes . I signed up for confident parenting . Should be interesting at the very least . Hoping to meet some other moms . 
Will be spending my day cleaning and doing laundry and then ............ Date night !! Yipeee , no kids !!! 
Just got spanked in the original super < PROPFIRST > brothers game . Oh how my skills have waned . My nintendo is still working pretty well after 21 years . 
Heard this at church today and I just can't stop thinking about it . Be the salt of the earth not the salt in the wound .

Would love it if everyone would be totally honest with themselves and others . 
is looking forward to a very long weekend . 
Makayla believes that Jesus can see everything because he uses binoculars and < PROPFIRST > believes its because He has really long eyes . :) I love my kids !!! 
will begin 40 days of prayer on 9/11 and ending on 10/20 lifting up President Obama . Believing for abundant blessing , super-natural protection , and tangible experiences of the love of God . God's agenda is not Republican or Democrat . He loves our president and our nation . Both need our prayers as never before . Will you join me ? 
Cleaning and laundry . What an exciting life ! 
Family coming iin tonight !! Should be a wonderful weekend . Can't hardly wait . 
EXHAUSTED !

Interesting fact from < PROPMALE > Ramsey : In the U.S. , there are nearly three times more millionaires living in homes that have a market value of under $ 300,000 than there are living in homes valued at $1 million or more . The #1 most popular make of car among millionaires is ... Toyota ( not BM ... W/Mercedes ) . - Dr. < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ( Author of The Millionaire Next Door )

Hunting for a nice antique dresser . Not going so well . Not as easy to find as I initially thought . 
Helpful hint : If you get a lipstick stain on your clothes just spray carpet cleaner on it and will come right out !! Who knew ?! 
Jackpot !! Finally found the antique dresser that I have been searching high and low for . Discovered it in Charlies Flea Market in North Springfield of all places . 
It is a momentous day in the Goff household . Our biggest boy is 5 today . Sniffle .... Sniffle .... Yesterday was filled with much celebration at < PROPMALE > E . Cheese with a custom made ice road trucker cake created by < PROPFIRST > . 
That < PROPFEMALE > Flinstone !! She is so spoiled . 
Does anyone else feel like the just clean up the same messes over and over and over again ? Ughhh !!

< PROPFIRST > is gone for another week . Ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhh !! 
Can I get a woot woot ? Between coupons and < PROPMALE>'s in store deals I saved myself a whopping $53 !!!!! 
Today at Chrisitan Publisher's Outlet I witnessed a 40 something employee literally chewing out a very timid 15ish year old coworker and then kindly wishing everyone at the store a blessed day . Seriously ??? Get it together , lady .

Just finished trimming sweet < PROPMALE>'s nails . What a good boy , not even a peep ! 
< PROPMALE > is wearing me out ! 
Makayla found an enormously long worm on our walk this morning . She decided he should ride wrapped around the handle bars of her bike . His name is officially Hurley and I have a feeling he is going to look more like a pancake when the kids are finished playing with him . :( Sorry Hurley . Hope life has been good to you !! 
ahhh , < PROPFEMALE > days are here again . The question is for how long ? Hmmmm .

It is a wonderful day !!! I am babysitting a preciuos little girl that I had the pleasure of watching last year . Today is the first day back on in the swing of things with her and she is a < PROPFEMALE > . I am just loving this . 
I just read that margarine actually has 27 ingredients in common with paint !! How disgusting . Why am I eating this God forsaken stuff ?! 
< PROPFIRST > informed that I needed to throw away the flowers he picked for me because they were frowning . 
The Caffiene withdrawl is taking me down in a bad way !! 
Is waiting for her carpets to dry . She might have gone a bit over the edge with the rug doctor yesterday :( 
So I think my hermit next door neighbor has vacated her home . The lawn is waist high and according to the meter lady , they have used like no gas or electricity . Her house is an eyesore . Does anyone know if there is anything that can be done about this ? 
Getting my haircut in the morning . WooHoo . I am long overdue .

God is doing so many wonderful things !! He is so awesome !!! 
This is to anyone who received an email from my yahoo address with a link to a random website attached . I did not send this . I have not idea how these messages were sent out . Apparently , the website is selling viagra , cialis , etc . I am so sorry guys . 
Looking forward to the Springfield Cardinals game tonight !! Praying it does not rain . 
So , one of my neighbors is mowing is back yard with his shirt off . Which might not be so bad except he is like 65 with gray hairy man boobs !! Man , I really could have done w/o that view today . 
Just got home from silver dollar city and I am pooped !! 
We just finished treasure hunting with the metal detector . I know we are such nerds . It was fun though . Our most valuable find was a 1969 quarter . Oh yeah !! 
Just got a new phone . trying this status update via phone . pretty cool . 
Had a blast at the < PROPFIRST > Valley fountains . It has been a good day only to be finished off by our favorite Friday night eat spot , El Puente . Yes , a good day indeed ! 
The ants go marching one by one thanks to my daughter who decided to bring handfuls of dirt and dump them on the basement tile . Little armies of ants are everywhere . So gross !! Thank goodness for vacuum cleaners . But , I have a feeling there are a few stragglers left . Yikes !!

Just finished a victorious shopping trip . $33 for one week's worth of groceeries is'nt to shabby for feeding a family of five . 
It was < PROPFEMALE>'s turn to pick a fun adventure for us today . She picked going to the zoo in humid 90+ degree weather . I better get while the gettin's good or we are going to get scorched . 
So my evening ended up like this . < PROPFIRST > put his feet through the back of a dining room chair . He then tried to pour himself a glass of lemonade and spilled the glass . In an attempt to refill the glass he knocked the entire pitcher of lemonade onto the floor . Then he swallowed a quarter resulting in a call to the nurse hotline . Thankfully , he is fine and my whole family fell asleep at 8 pm . 
Ahh , it is a peaceful day in the Goff household . I anticipate getting a lot done toay . 
Man , I need to lose weight . Thus begins the cycle . Work like mad to lose 20 lbs and then gain it all back the instant I lose it . I hate this !! I seriously need to lose more than 20 lbs and I desperately need the will power to do it . Ugghhh !! 
Here is a little fyi for anyone who likes a good deal . The Sunday paper had a coupon insert with Crest couopns in it . One of those was for $10 off white strips . < PROPMALE > s.com has an ecoupon ( just register your plus card ) for $10 off also . So you can use both offers . The Springfield < PROPMALE>'s on Battlefield Rd . has them on sale for $24.99 . With your coupons , you can purchase for $4.99 . Hurry ecoupons expire tomorrow . 
Getting used to the feel of a laptop . Kind of weird after using a desktop for so long . But I think I like it . Change is good ! 
When I asked < PROPFIRST > what he learned about Sunday School today , he said Ozark . What ? I asked . < PROPFIRST > replied , you know , Ozark with the rain and the rainbow . He was talking about < PROPMALE>'s Ark but to him it sounded like the teacher was saying Ozark ( a city very close to Springfield ) LOL !! 
Our watermelon vine has totally exploded . Its little trendles are creeping over the edges of our raised bed and it bears approximately 8 or 9 watermelons . So exciting . 
On < PROPFIRST>'s < PROPFEMALE > banks I stand and cast a wishful eye . 
Just went to Dillons and bought 21 tubes of Crest toothpaste and got them absolutely FREE !!! I would say we will be stocked for a long , long while . WooHoo !!! 
Winding down from a fantastic Branson vacation . We had the best day on Tablerock lake and celebrated < PROPMALE>'s 2nd birthday . Such wonderful memories ! 
Comission starved sales girls are not my favorite . Just sayin ' . 
Finished shopping with < PROPFIRST > for school clothes . I am exhausted !! Who knew shopping with a five year old could be well ...... so energy draining . 
I pulled the ( out of control ) weeds in the garden this afternoon . It rained several times while I was working and I thoroughlly enjoyed it . I was soaking wet and muddy but it felt good to get the job done . I would say my inner < PROPFEMALE > has begun a slow , quiet descent from her much beloved throne . :) 
< PROPMALE > has just learned to say I love you . Its so cute . He says , you you . 
Enjoying the lovely 80 degree weather . We even made it to the zoo for a very enjoyable outing . Ahhh . I wish it could stay this way until fall .

Received two much needed challenges yesterday . 1 . To cultivate generosity in every area of my life . 2 . To cultivate a sensitive heart in my children so that they may hear God calling to them and be able to readily respond to His voice . Thank you for your message Pastor < PROPMALE > and for your insightful article ( Almost ) Dr. < PROPFIRST > Darrow . 
Tomorrow is the big day . We should find out if < PROPFIRST > will be able to transfer to < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > elementary . Keeping our fingers crossed . The waiting is agonizing . !! 
Does anyone have an idea of what a good price would be for a set of wooden bunkbeds with boxsprings and mattresses ? I'm shopping used and don't want to pay too much . 
Panicking ..... a little bit !! 
Wooooohoooo !!! Just heard back from < PROPMALE > elementary and < PROPFIRST > is in !! Yes , yes , Yes !! 
Sweltering here in Springfield . It's 10:30 and 100 degrees . Seriously , literally 100 DEGREES ! How is that even possible ?! 
Scored some awesome bunk beds off of Craigslist , converted < PROPFIRST>'s ( basement bedroom ) room into a play room , and moved < PROPFIRST > in with < PROPMALE > . After the tearing down of the crib and the installation of the bunkbeds , I just realized this is the first time that we have not had a crib set up since < PROPFIRST > was born . Sniffle , Sniffle . 
The Lord has heard my prayers !!! It is a mere 77 degrees today with some cloud cover . YES !!!! 
Cleaning house today . Then off to the Fountains tomorrow and to the zoo on Frideay . One last hoorah before < PROPFIRST > goes to school !! I am so excited for him but sad for myself . My babies are growing up . That seems to be my theme for this week . :)

Cam's 2nd day of school turned out to be a hit !! He made a new friend named < PROPMALE > . Apparently they struck up a conversation in the boys bathroom when < PROPMALE > showed Cam how to make tooting noises with his armpit and also taught him a song about toots . < PROPFIRST > is super excited about < PROPMALE > and his abilities . Please pray for Us . ;)

So < PROPFEMALE > has this large pink < PROPFEMALE > teapot set . ( The teapot is what all the other pieces fit into ) . Toady , < PROPMALE > picks up the teapot by the handle and points the spout toward me while making shooting noices . From teapot to makeshift gun . O brother !! 
I know its a wimpy attitude . but sometimes I just wish God would < PROPMALE > me a teeny < PROPFEMALE > breather from constant challenges . I just feel like crying !! Ughhhhhhhhh 
Attended \Discovering your ministry gifts\ " last night Central . So inspiring and what a great group . So much love . I had a blast !! " 
God never ceases to amaze me . When it looks like all the chips are down , He comes in & does something totally unexpected , filling my heart with so much HOPE !!!

What are the odds that my priority shipped purchase from ebay actually makes it here tomorrow or Thursday ? 
So I tried to venture out in the mini < PROPFIRST > with the kids in tow for the first time in two days ....... yeah not so much .

The activities for the day are as follows :\ 
Go sledding with the kids and pray that I do not injure myself . \ 
Build a giant snow man . \ 
Drink Hot Chocolate .

Grrrrrrrrrrr !! and Ugghhhhhhhhhh !! Its all I have to say right now !!! 
< PROPFIRST > has been caring for a pet caterpillar for the last 2 weeks or so . He has been telling us for the last 3 days that his caterpillar was getting fatter . Sure enough , today he made a cocoon around himself . So cool !! Can't wait to see what he will look like as a butterfly .
