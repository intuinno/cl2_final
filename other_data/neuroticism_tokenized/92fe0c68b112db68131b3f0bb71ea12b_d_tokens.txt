is tired . Doesn't make sense , I've hardly done anything today . 

Heh , I've already managed to lose track of my schedule ... I remember some of it ... >_> 
Found my schedule again ! However , I seem to have misplaced the band music ... 
Does anyone know when band camp starts ? I'm kinda-sorta-verily-much hopeless with keeping track of stuff ... 
Wow . It just started raining . 
I'm burnt . T_T It was worse last year , though ... 
I'm burnt . Again . Or is it still ? Hmmm .... 
... my head hurts ... 
Half an essay to finish and I'm kinda-sorta-mostly done . Ish . 
Done ! ^_^ 
is bored ... 
is doing homework ... 
is very , very , very , very , very , very , very , ..., very bored . 
is enjoying fooling around on the internet via really old computer that is running on windows 98 . 
Because of my brother , I am currently watching the G.I. < PROPFIRST > Movie . The old one . Squee , Starscream's voice actor ! 
I finished watching the G . I . Joe Movie . Wow . Starscream voice ~ <3 
Sailor Megatron . Wow . Youtube is awesome . 
If I said that you just lost the game , how many people would curse me , teasingly or otherwise ... hmmm ... 
Does anyone like Transformers and Sailor < PROPFEMALE > ? If so type in \Sailor Megatron\ " on YouTube . It is just < PROPFEMALE > perfect ~ <3 " 
They should put a Transformers G1 quiz on FreeRice . That would be awesome . 
9 days til plane ride to London 
I just -love- being completely ignored . Not . Oh well , guess I'll just watch the older TMNT or maybe play a computer game . 
OMP . Krang turned Pepto-Bismal Pink . When did that happen ?! 
Primus . The ' 87 TMNT robot is hilarious . He act a bit like the G1 Transformers . Specifically the Decepticons . Squee ~ <3 
How many Turtle Vans do they have ?! One goes into the river with the turtles and April's driving another . Riight . 
I feel a bit invisible . 
will be watching the 1987 TMNT soon . Maybe . 
I'm watching the 1st TMNT movie . Nya ~ <3 
Nya . Karate Kid reference in 2nd TMNT movie . But who cares . 
Amazing . In Castle , they -never- have to wait on elevators . And they hardly ever take the stairs . It's like magic , except not . 
I liked the old TMNT better . The 2003 version actually has a story , but Mikey is the only funny one . The 1987 Turtles had a lot of cute puns ... and the toddler turtles ~ <3 
I guess the real problem with the 2003 TMNT is < PROPMALE > , especially his voice . It's all deep and un-Yakko-y . And 2003 Raph is meanish . And to my knowledge , hasn't been portrayed as an adorable 5-year-old . It's funny . I don't like the old Mikey , but the new one is the only character that I like better . 
Study Island is very stupid , at least for science . I have given up on it . 
< PROPMALE>'s 1987 voice . They changed it back . Nya , < PROPMALE > Paulsen ~ ! 
Donatello said , \Yipes . \ " Nya ~ <3 " 
I just solved Einstein's Riddle . Huh . 
is covered in brownie mix . Stupid exploding package ... 
Good grief , they gave poor 1987 < PROPFIRST > a terribly deep voice in TMNT Forever . The only old voice that really seems alright is < PROPMALE > . And they keep making fun of the old ones . Mutant bananas ... although , jelly bean pizza is realistic for them ... ' -_- 
... 
I have a headache ... 
is watching season 3 of the 1987 TMNT ... >_< So wonderfully lame ... ~ <3 
I like skipping school . Field trips are nice ... 
got an interesting book out of the library . Apparently , my current sleep schedule is the same as a box jellyfish . 
I scratched my eye . Hopefully it's nothing , but if the doctor prescribes an eye patch for more than one day , then I'll be doomed on the guiding exercises . 
Contrary to popular belief , the grass ISN'T greener on the other side - it's greener over the septic tank . 
Pineapple pizza = = ^_^ 
I'm watching Psycho . I'm sorry , but a psychotic granny ? It seems almost funny . Maybe that's just what happens when you're watching at 3am . 
I'm thankful for my 7-year-old and 6-year-old cousins who have recently been introduced to the G . I . Joe : A Real American Hero cartoon . ^_^ 
Why would TF Headmasters have Trainbots ? It doesn't make sense . >.> 
I now have a Red Alert toy . - <3 - 
Oi . I've been reading various cartoon fan fictions . Apparently there's a fanfic of Blue's Clues that mocks Death Note . 
G . I . Joe Renegades = = happy fangirl 
Timber . They're introducing Timber the same way as in the ' 80s G . I . Joe . Well , minus the whole radioactive/glow-in-the-dark Snake Eyes business . ^_^ 
Cherry ~
