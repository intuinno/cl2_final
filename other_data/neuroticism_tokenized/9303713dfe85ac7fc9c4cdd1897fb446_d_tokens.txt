is fairly certain that I chipped a bone or a tooth when that 12 pack fell . Don't tell my dentist . 

I think my job is becoming hazardous to my < PROPMALE > . 
Happy Independence day ! 
Ahh , the perfect way to end the day ... sirloin burgers on the Barbecue ... a beautiful sunset ... a campfire and s'mores ... and the sound of fireworks all around . All with the company of my family !

Is back from < PROPFEMALE > and wants to return to her air conditioned hotel room :( 
feels alone :( 
any one know about a fire in the Birch Bay area ? I can see some flames and an orange glow from my upstairs window and was curious to know what's going on .

My mother is a muppet hater . 
I will NOT spend my last day of summer sitting home alone . Even if it means doing the one thing I've told myself over and over again that I wouldn't do alone . 
I HATE THIS $#** . WHEN WILL IT END . I'M SO FURIOUS ... UGH 
It is in your truly darkest hours that one finds their true friends those who like you for who you are , who will be there for you when YOU need them not when they want to , those who always have your back . Some of you are so far away others just down the street , but I know that everyone I just talked to has my back . 
Wow how things do change ... 
Sometimes I miss the old days ... but then i realize that I'm actually glad those days are over , and I move on with my life :) 
my daddy was hit by a school bus today . but he's okay . check out the pics of his < PROPFIRST > .

And it's midnight ... Now I can go to bed ... Happy New Year ! 
Who knows what this year will hold . Will love come knocking or will disaster blow by ? Will I meet someone new or will someone I love leave ? Will I make mistakes or change the world ? Only the Lord knows what this world will bold for me but I am ready . 
The New Year has started off with a Bang for me . If things keep progressing the way they do I'm looking at the best year ever . Not to mention that I turn 20 in two weeks ! 
Is going to have a great night with one of the best people in the world ! 
I may or may not have had to much sugar ... no not yet ... little more ... i forgot what I was saying ... 
I'm finally back at school !

God is amaizing with all that happened this morning he still got me to school in one peice and on time .

Tonight's the night ... LOST is back !!! 
I can't believe the connections I haven't made till last night , like how < PROPMALE > Somerhalder was in both LOST and Vampire Diaries and how < PROPFIRST > Worthington was a main character in Terminator Salvation and Avatar . How did I miss these ? 
I kind of like the new facebook layout . I don't know why all these people are complaining . 
had the best day ever with < PROPFEMALE > Vis we played a game of war , had a picnic , walked her dog through the park , got a pedicure , ate little Ceaser's pizza , watched Time Travelers wife , played scatagories , made popcorn , and watched iron man !!! Best day ever ! 
I have been watching LOST for two full days now . It's the most addictive thing EVER !!! 
I'm suprised at how shollow the human species can be . Including me . We think we are right and so we fight eachother in our own ways . Why is it so hard to admit fault and appologize . Why is it so hard to change ideals , to just say I promise and mean it . Have we fallen so far we can't pick ourselves back up ? 
Back to school . 
I can't believe only a month and a half left in this semester then summer Break !? Where did the time go ? 
I don't understand why the students in my History course come in at random times DURRING the lecture ... how hard can it be to walk accross the campus and make it to class on time ? 
I move for the automatic two week suspension of all Washington State Drivers Licenses . 
I am not < PROPFEMALE > , I don't drink Alcohol and I don't believe in a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow so why would I wear green ? 
I'm in a < PROPFEMALE > wars mood . I've watched the first three episodes again for the ... i think it's the 15th time and will begin watching the last three probably tonight . 
For some reason all my FarmVille posts expire right after I post them so no one can get the prizes I post ... like the eggs or stallions . 
only thirteen school days left ??? How is this possible ??? Didn't most people just have spring break ??? 
I don't understand the female need to do the \Charlie's Angle\ " pose EVERYWHERE . " 
Just spent about twenty < PROPFEMALE > . trying to figure out how to resart her laptop since the trackpad wasn't working ... I felt like an idiot when I realized that the button i use to turn on my computer works to turn it off too ... ugh . 
I really REALLY hate the cupon books at the store ... everyone goes crazy >:/ ( 23 days and counting ) . 
April Fools day today ... And a great night planned ... ( 22 days and counting ) 
Another large earthquake hit's Northern Mexico/ Sothern US ( all the way up to Las Vagas ) . Magnitude 7.2 . And yet my dad still doesn't believe me that more are to come . 
AND STUFF ... 
I'm not a bad person ... Am I ???

They say that your old when your music is played in grocery stores ... so how old am I now that Miley < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > Swift music is playing at my store ??? 
I think I'm one of the very few people ( mostly girls ) who really doesn't care if I see Eclipse in theaters . I just thought New < PROPFEMALE > was awful and it put me off the movies . 
Great another night on my own . Man you'd think that the one day I have off to spend the night with my parents and they would make an effort to be home . I guess I understand , mom's out on girls night out and dad's working late ... understandable . I just wish I could do something with someone instead of sitting home alone all day and into the night . 
It was nice to have the gang back together , no matter how short of time it was .

Attn : under age people of < PROPFEMALE > ... When purchasing Alcohol from the stores there are two things to keep in mind . 1 . Don't purchase Alcohol in front of a worker who is also underage . I mean if you are clearly not older then they are then your too young to by the drink . 2 . \Oh I thought it was Fruit Punch\ " isn't a good excuse . "

There comes a time when you have to shake the can of \injustice\ " and hand it off to your enemy . Then run like hell as it explodes in their face . " 
Why is it no one listens to me or believes me until the time comes where the events I predicted come true ... then they deny the fact that I was right all along ??? Doesn't anyone care what < PROPFEMALE > has to say ??? 
Is having a pity-fest with my best friend . How I miss you < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Blankers . 
Some people come into our lives and leave footprints on our hearts ... others come into our lives and make us want to leave footprints on their faces . 
Is writing an Epilogue for Cambela then it will be done for real this time . I just felt that it needed a final chapter to tie together some of the lose ends . Like a braid needs a hair tie at the end :)

If you need a friend ( text me ) need a laugh ( call me ) need a hug ( stop by ) need money ( this number is no longer in service ) :) 
Every year .... Every Thanksgiving I have a quiz in my afternoon class ... The school should respect American Thanksgiving and have No quizzes or papers on that day . 
Well No way I'm going to try and travel today ... I guess No School for Me ! It is a Thanksgiving Miracle ! 
This week it will be just me and my computer and two papers . But once thursday rolls around my school work will be done and all I will have to do is study ! 
No I did not just trip , I attacked the floor with my awesome NINJA skills . 
Watch the things you say to those you love ; watch your actions . You might not know it but you can hurt them without knowing it . Then one day you might wish you hadn't .

I totally called it ... I'm going to be at work from 5-10 on my 21st Birthday ... Oh well it's not like I've got any better plans . 
So far I like the rewrite of Great Discovery ( Legend of Mondora ) MUCH better than the original . There is so much more Foreshadowing and it blends in better with the other 6 ... 
I just saw the weirdest preview ever ... it's for a movie called Rubber . where an inanimate tire discovers it has the power to blow off people's heads ... I can't tell if it is a joke or not ... check it out on IMDB . 
I just got into my first car accident :'( . I'm a little shaken up and my baby is in need of much repair . 
I'm really sore and tired today :( 
I just took a long hot bath to soften my sore muscles . I feel slightly better now but still hurt . 
The tow truck is finally on its way to pick up my baby for the work she desperately needs :) 
Public Service Announcement : When driving , don't mess around with your phone . It is stupid and can be fatal . Trust me , the victims of cell phone related accidents will hate you for it . Yes , I hate that man that hit me , he could have avoided this whole mess by simply hanging up his phone but no he hit me and now I have to endure this pain . 
And now a moment of silence for my baby has been deemed TOTALED . 
Costumer : \Excuse me I looking for pawcon . \ " \ 
It's been said that everlasting friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question the friendship . These types of friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been or how far away they live and they don't hold grudges . They understand that life is busy but you will ALWAYS love them . Re-post if you have at least 1 of these friends , they will know who they are ! 
So ready for tonight . Let's get this party started already . 
Customer : \Excuse me I have a question . \ " \ 
\Oh I just had a thought ! \ " \ " Okay what's your thought ? \ " \ " Kings have Crowns . \ " ( Thank you for that wisdom < PROPFEMALE > Vis ) "

and the hair is gone ... so to speak ... 
off to go car shopping !!! 
Blueberry , Strawberry , Grape 
FINALLY !!! i HAVE MY NEW CAR !!! 
FINALLY !!! I HAVE MY NEW CAR !!! 
I think people over analyze < PROPMALE > . Did it ever occur to you that maybe a painter painted something just because he thought it would look cool . There doesn't always have to be a deep philisophical story behind each and every painting . 
I was going to post something really cool but then this shiny thing flew by and ... oh look there it is ... 
My professor just walked in wearing a bright yellow cotton t-shirt over his light gray dress shirt . He kind of looks like a lemon ...

The One u just called fat ? She has been starving herself & she has lost over 30lbs . The One u just called stupid ? She has a learning disability & studies over 4hrs a night . The One you just called ugly ? She spends hours putting makeup on hoping people will like her . The One you just tripped ? She is abused enough at home . Theres alot more to people than you think . Put this as your status if your against bullying .
