Truth is , I hate all these news feed updates . 
Dear facebook ads on the sidebar , \ 
I do not have Asian Drama Fever . That sounds like a personal problem . \ 
Sincerely , \ 
Me . 
I need about 6 more titles for the Shant Game list to be at 100 . Ideas ? 
I have decided that if I ever lose my sense of taste permanently , you have permission to kill me . 
I bite into the cookie . I feel the all too familiar texture of rough crumbs and soft center swirl as my tongue presses against the roof of my mouth . But the comfort of a sugar high doesn't flood through my veins ; it is replaced by a dominating sadness . There's no flavor . Being ill sucks away any flavor not only in food , but in life . \ 
Please make me well . \ 
* Sniffle * 
Saw < PROPMALE > Potter !!! I cried , haha . Championships this weekend !!! We may get rained out on Sunday , so wish us luck for tomorrow ! Beyer ROCK THE HOUSE !!!!!! <3

Dear < PROPMALE > Rice , \

If I knit an hour a day , and 1 hour = 1inch of scarf , \

Does anyone have that picture of me and < PROPMALE > on the day after prelims ?? 
Contemplative question of the day : What would you get Gandhi for Christmas ? 
Study . Study . < PROPFIRST > Swift . Study . Study . Die . 
Hmmm . I think I get a bit too profound in the early morning ... 
Finished Fruit's Basket ! <3 
Question : Does Christmas cheer come from the sugar high , the greed , or the warm fuzzy feeling in your heart ? 
I'm in at UC < PROPMALE > !!!! :) 
I'm so freaked about college applications that I won't even let my DVR recording space fall below 70% . 
Why am I the only one that's totally pumped for college ? 
Farewell , winter break . Goodbye , sleep . So long , sanity . \
