The moment when you first wake up in the morning is the most wonderful of the twenty-four hours . No matter how weary or dreary you may feel , you possess the certainty that , during the day that lies before you , absolutely anything may happen . And the fact that it practically always doesn't , matters not a jot . The possibility is always there . ~ Monica Baldwin 
had four classes today ( eight hours total ) and in between , just studied for seven hours . The motivation is back ! 
First nap in weeks ! 
To laugh often and much , to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children , to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends , to appreciate beauty , to find the best in others , to leave the world a bit better ; to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived . This is to have succeeded ! 
I myself have never been able to find out precisely what feminism is : I only know that people call me a feminist whenever I express sentiments that differentiate me from a door mat or a prostitute . ~ Rebecca West , \Mr Chesterton in Hysterics : A Study in Prejudice "

of grief and bereavement , who can tolerate not knowing , not curing , not\

\Everyone is a < PROPFEMALE > and has a dark side that he never shows to anybody . \ " - < PROPFIRST > Twain " 
People\ 
like me suffer because we are sensitive to the world around us , afraid\ 
to show our real feelings and too angry to let all our feelings out . We\ 
may be called complainers by those who do not live in our realm , but in\ 
ourselves we know our inner truth . We struggle but are strong . We fall\ 
but strive to have hope . When no one believes us , we hold unto\ 
ourselves the power to be .
