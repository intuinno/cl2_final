-The SEC had the most players taken among conferences in the draft . Behind the SEC’s 49 selections were the Big Ten ( 34 ) , ACC ( 31 ) , Big 12 ( 30 ) and Pac-10 ( 29 ) . -The SEC has now led or tied for the most selections in the NFL Draft for 11 of the last 13 seasons and the last four drafts . 
just got a free pizza from AOTS ! 
showing up 15 mis early for class is overrated exept if its @ < PROPFIRST>'s!!!

Space , the final frontier . These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise . Its continuing mission : to explore strange new worlds , to seek out new life forms and new civilisations , to boldly go where no one has gone before .

if i got a D in a course do i have to retake it to graduate ? 
i just made a bet with my parents , they seem to think i dont have the work ethic to make a 4.0 ..... so i got them to put some money on it , because its \a safe bet\ " they were willing to put up A LOT of money .... " 
\Arguing with anonymous strangers on the \

so much for sitting on the beach this week .... gotta paint every room in the house !

i just deleted a large portion of my past in the form of all of my facebook messages all the way back to 2006 .... lot of stupid mistakes that are really funny yet really pathetic to read 4 years later ! 
hmmm .... 
has anyone had experience with range rovers ? all the reviews are either really good or really bad so im wondering what to belive .... 
< PROPFEMALE > Trek Next Generation and Cinnamon Toast Crunch ..... could my morning possibly get any better ?? 
wonder what are the odds are my parents will like PF Changs ? 
just watched the < PROPMALE > season finale episodes .... all i can say is AWESOME ! 
im < PROPFEMALE > ready to get home ..... 10 days in florida is starting to get old ... dont get me wrong , i love my parents , but i am bringing a friend next trip down here cause im going crazy ..... i carried on an entire conversation with myself this afternoon cause i was < PROPFEMALE > bored ...... 
ah Louisiana , Americas ghetto ... 
finaly back in Texas ! 
home at last ! Driving to FL is a 2 day drive and we just pulled it in 1 .... never again ! 
nothing worse than a buch of noobs running @ full throtle ruining the lake ! 
so i just dropped my phone in the water ..... so no more cellphone ..... i'm actually kinda hoping it doesn't come back to life cause i want the htc evo 4g .... but i told my parents i would give it till monday to resurect it self ... 
phone shopping ..... but i need my sprint account info ! 
i am soon to be the proud owner of a new HTC Evo 4G ! 
Ok the old phone is temporarily working ..... hoping it will make it through the week till my HTC Evo gets in ! 
\You're never going to live up to anyone's expectations 
is in love with my HTC Evo 4G ! 
is tired .... 
The SEC is the best conference ... if you don't believe me go look @ the CWS bracket ....

Go TCU !!!! 
\I got kicked off the high school debate team for sayin ' yeah well fuck you ' I thought i had won cause the other kid was speechless ! \""

' 68 camaro , blue with white stripes , < PROPFEMALE > sick ! 
not feeling 100% today ... 
Go Frogs !! 
some towel head decided to leave a bomb in the burnet county court house ! 
finally leaving for Florida .... my hope is we only drive half of the 16 hr drive .... atleast I talked my parents into going the quick way through < PROPMALE > .... 
a little over 4 hours in and we're already through Houston ... this is fairly good progress , we should be able to make it most of the way through Louisiana today ! 
stopped for the night somewhere east of baton rouge ... 
finally to destin ..... only 20 more < PROPMALE > ! 
just made it to the Florida house ! 
just got stung in the < PROPFEMALE > by a hornet ! FML ! 
starting to question my sanity ..... 
and on the 5th day there was sunshine .... 
the sunshine was short lived .... it started raining just as I was headed to the beach :/ 
PF Chengs with the padres .... 
sometime i wonder if i should start saying the things on my mind .... 
its 5 , I need a beer break ! 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > black is not the best scotch in the world but tonight its what i have and i'm not complaining .... 
my parents keep changing their minds , now they're saying we're not headed home till Thursday ! :/ 
someone stole my mountain bike from the front porch of our rental unit ..... I'm 95% sure it was these frat boys from UGA who were staying next door :/ 
does anyone know anything about engine swaps ? 
what is the one thing no vacation wouldn't be complete without ? An afternoon with a real estate agent ! 
\just know the only reason your beating us is beacuse our best athletes are busy playing real sports \"" 
finally on the way home .... somewhere in Alabama I think , these crappy states all look the same so we could be anywhere between Florida and Texas .... 
home !!! 
first thing i find out after being out of town for a week ... the state farm adjuster has never been by the body shop to look my truck , so its still not repaired ! 
I can't get my rental car till 530 :/ 
found out that i have the rental car for atleast 4 more days .... fortunately its a fun car , i didnt realize how much i missed RWD , even in a big car with a v6 i manage to have some fun ! 
not to gloat but I have a touch screen phone that actually uses 4G and isn't being recalled because of a < PROPMALE > designed flaw ! Take that iPhone 4 owners ! 
finally got the case for my phone ! 
just got my truck back ! 
so mom has decided I'm going to < PROPFEMALE > cordon b < PROPFEMALE > u in < PROPFIRST > after I graduate .... 
defensive driving class today :/ 
ok im not really an old spice fan but i am open to buying old spice body wash if they keep making those commercials ! they never get old ! and to all the other companies who make horrible adds : thats how advertising is supposed to work ! 
so today is the last day of the x-games and first day of shark week ! I don't think I even want to leave the house today ! 
I feel like # ? * ! \ 
Don't give a ____ and a whole lot of other choice words I can't say .... 
can't decide what to do ! Part of me feels like I should go to Florida .... but I don't really want to go !!! 
Tebow and Harvin were probably the best duo in college history .... I hope some NFL GM gets them together someday ! 
just got Arby's! I wish there was one in kville !! 
got a cold .... this sucks ! 
feeling like the flu .... 
there are no words to describe this feeling ! 
in need of a change ..... 
getting the boat back today .... only problem is yesterday was like my last < PROPMALE > to use it before school starts ! 
Krugerrand ! 
good day ! Didn't have to go to New Mexico ! Got to go out on the boat , and landed a shove it on my wakeskate ! Thanks for all the birthday wishes ! 
finally broke down and got a twitter account , not really sure why ... 
first day of class , wanna skip both of them ..... 
listening to the \Tapping into the Chemistry of Beer and Brewing\ " webinar through ACS ... " 
so apparently facebook is getting ready for another round of pointless changes that no one wants , hopefully this time they at least fix 1 or 2 of the massive privacy issues .... 
just realized my XM subscription is up :( 
college football tonight ! Southern Miss @ South < PROPFEMALE > kicks off @ 6:30 , this means all is right with the world at last ! 
my schedule is crazy this semester ..... i really wish i was taking a psyc class ! too bad i already used up all my electives and put off taking all of the hard classes for senior year ! i didn't plan ahead too well :/ 
I freekin love my parents ! They are absolutely amazing and they have worked < PROPFEMALE > hard so that they can do some crazy awesome stuff !!! 
< PROPFEMALE > many good games today ! Miami OH Florida Gators Gators at 11:00 , UCLA @ KSU at 2:30 , ORST @ TCU Football 6:45 , and end the day with NC vs LSU ! 
PTSD : Post Tebow Stress Dissorder , the offense isn't working at all against an easy team :/ 
ooh urban is gonna be mad after this game , < PROPFEMALE > many sloppy mistakes ! 
sitting at the bar at the bar at the TAOM , its freekin awesome ! 
I haven't actually eaten anything all day and I just realized I may have had too much Glenfiddich on an empty stomach ... need a burger ! 
let's go va tech !!! 
is anyone else having problems with itunes 10 crashing ? 
ok so i am definitely gonna sell my truck ! i decided that today on my way to kville .... fingers crossed it sells quick ! 
Captain Slow : whats yours ? \ 
Jezza : phobia ? < PROPMALE > labor , you know that ! 
bad start to the game , not looking like a top 10 team ! 
im not sure who we need back more : wright , haden , and < PROPFIRST > strong ; or tebow and hernandez , and Maurkice Pouncey .... 
well its nice to see the acc is still crap , va tech lost to < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > , fsu is getting hammered by OU , and miami isn't having any success against ohio state ! boise beating va tech doesn't look like such a power win anymore ! 
damn , only got an 88 on my spanish test :/ 
< PROPMALE > jobs needs to either fix itunes 10 or die a slow and painful death ! 
physics test .... crap I forgot to study ... 
hahaha my first experience with someone who was really high , and of course because this is Burnet it was almost definitely meth ... that lady was crazy ! she came in because she wanted to look at the pretty colors in the stained class , and then she touched almost everything that was shiny ! 
game time , +100k hostile fans at neyland stadium ! lets go Gators !! 
first half was not great .... 
atleast TCU Football can score points .... 
the Florida Gators really needs a new offensive coordinator ! 
< PROPMALE > Tebow for the touchdown .... oh wait , < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > for the touchdown ! 
\just change the 3 to a 5 and we've seen this play before\ " Verne Lundquist " 
i just realized that i let 30,000 rewards points expire on my < PROPMALE > card ! FML !!! 
physics lab is murder ! I just want to be done ! 
that's it I'm moving to Ecuador after graduation , gonna get a beach compound and live out my dreams ... 
vodka , coconut rum , coors light , and Tokyo Drift ... epic 
dad just called and told me that I have to drive to burnet because someone broke into the store and I have to meet the po-po ... that sobered me up quickly ! 
i wish we had a big comfy chair here , but since we don't i think i may pass out on the floor while I'm waiting to hear back from the carpenter ...... 
today is giving me a good taste of what my parents go through running their real estate empire ... since they are out of town I'm having to coordinate everything , 2 of our 4 buildings on the square in Burnet got robbed ( our store plus one of our renters ) the guy only got about $60 plus 2 checkbooks ... the guy had to have been retarded ! but he managed to do quite a lot of damage ... I'm thinking in the +$2k range ! 
I want to be < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > ! He's freekin awesome ! 
anyone wanna go to < PROPMALE > tomorrow ?? 
this car is amazing !!! 
It's easy to be the #1 rush defense when the best team you have played all year is known for their air raid offense .... but when you face a mediocre rushing team you find out just how good your not ... oh if you can't tell I'm talking about UT , how humiliating ! 
let's go Texans !!! 
Mmmm coffee ! Brewed super strong just like it should be ! 
is the worst procrastinator in history , I'm sitting here wired on caffeine , I have tons of homework due tomorrow and I just re-watched the entire 5th season of HIMYM because I can't concentrate ! Oh and there is literally nothing good on tv at this hr , and the commercials are really dirty ! 
any pre-med or pharmacy majors know what the shelf life on adderal is ? I'm hoping more than 6 years .... stupid ADD ! I must finish my homework !! 
you know what's sad ? < PROPFIRST > Vick would have been a hall of fame QB if he hadn't been such an idiot ! I'm glad he's a starter again though , he is one of my favorite players in the NFL , I really hope he doesn't f-up this time !! 
tonight is definitely one of those nights I'm going to end up getting 0hrs 0min of sleep .... but between the 6 year old adderall and the pot of coffee and the monster energy drink I'm feeling wide awake ! 
1 < PROPFIRST > 1:17 \ 
17 To the < PROPMALE > of ages , immortal , invisible , the only God , be honor and < PROPFEMALE > forever and ever . Amen . #Bible http://j.mp/adMnK3 
my ankle is massive ! 
took a nap , feel much better , now its time to finish the pchem problem set .... 
when will the misery end ? my ankle is still swollen and I have trouble walking and now it feels like I'm getting the flu :/ 
< PROPFEMALE > i really want a VF Engineering supercharger for my S4 .... 
it looks like the UT defense picked up right where they left off last week .... 
im hating my phone right now .... i get like 6hrs of battery life when i'm in burnet ! this sucks .... 
was just looking at the top gear power lap times and my car is faster than a < PROPFEMALE > 911 turbo , a Ferrari 575M , and the oh so gorgeous Aston < PROPFIRST > Vanquish ! 
today is such a nice day , I think I'm gonna take the back way home ! 
did a little bit of rally style driving down a dirt road on my way to Burnet and now my poor AUDI S4 is in desperate need of a detail . i don't understand how i got < PROPFEMALE > much dirt inside the car ! 
realizing that promoting a group/page on the new facebook is much more difficult than it used to be , either that or im not trying as hard .... but i still remember the < PROPFEMALE > days when i had six figure membership across my groups ! 
trick plays are a way to compensate for lack of talent , and < PROPMALE > mi < PROPMALE > is the < PROPMALE > ! He just relies on lucky breaks to win games ! I hate LSU ! 
this is < PROPFIRST>'s game ! 
bad throw :/ 
for the first time in my entire life I fell below the poverty line on my personal income lol 
while I'm on the topic of poverty lines , I am trying to talk my mom into buying a house in either bar harbor or Kennebunkport .... 2 towns full of people who have never heard of the poverty line lol 
< PROPMALE > Harvin is a beast !!! 
wonder how much longer < PROPFIRST > is going to waste time with Romo/Phillips ? 
writing and research presentation tomorrow and I can't concentrate on it because of the show < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > is putting on against the Yankees ! 8 innings , 2 hits , no runs ! 
hmm some how falling asleep for 2 hrs doesn't seem like its gonna help me finish my presentation .... 
epic fail on my computer , I loaded a bunch of websites for research for my presentation , well while I was napping my computer restarted so now I have to go to town in search of internet .... FML !! 
Suited up , and it was LEGEND-wait for it-DAIRY ! 
not feeling well :/ 
ok so my new hero is < PROPFIRST > Dunst ... 
went all in on a < PROPMALE > high flush after pulling a 7h on the river .... little did I know that 7 made the other guys full house .... 
ah high-school football ... it has been far too long old friend ! 
go Vikings !! 
< PROPMALE > Harvin !!!! 
ok < PROPFIRST > , its the 4th quarter , your in green bay , down by 4 ... time to work your magic .... or atleast stop throwing ints ! 
glad the Florida Gators spent the last 2 weeks tweaking the offense ! 
will \the thrill\ " hill ! " 
Dear Mr Obama , the nation isn't saying we haven't seen change , the nation was trying to tell you that we don't like the changes you've made ! 
i know its just vandy , and they are basically useless , but i think Florida Gators have fixed the offense .... 41 points is not bad for 30 < PROPFEMALE > of football .... 
Geaux LSU ! 
where does < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > come up with all these bs plays ? 
so just realized I have a p-chem test Tuesday , physics test Wednesday , and then tests Thursday in both writing&research and Spanish ... 
Who would have ever guessed Spanish would be easier than physics .... 
dibs 
feeling a suden urge to race .... anyone up for a challenge ? 
< PROPMALE > 26:4 \ 
4 Trust in the Lord forever , for the Lord God is an everlasting rock . #Bible http://j.mp/cG93kG 
sometimes I just want to skip ahead 10 years .... or at very least 5 .... 
well today sucks .... 
a good long drive down a road that thankfully had no cops and lots of curves does wonders for ones mood ! I feel 1000% better ! 
< PROPFIRST > Debose to the house !!!! 
hmm i believe that the Florida Gators needs to do something different with the QB rotation .... like let < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > throw the ball to keep the defense from stacking the box every time , everyone knows < PROPFIRST > Brantley isn't a run threat so make them realize someone else is a pass threat ! 
the Florida Gators need a new offensive coordinator ! 
so my car is \limited\ " to 155 however I just hit 167 before I had to slow down for a corner ... another 1/4 mile and I'm sure I could have maxed out my 170 speedo ! " 
if < PROPMALE > Addazio is still the Florida offensive coordinator on Monday I'm switching my favorite team to TCU ! 
wow the cowboys are winning ! 
< PROPMALE > Tebow rushed for a TD and now just threw his first TD pass ! 
had 4 tests last week , I got 3 C's and one B :/ 
guess I can check \get singled out by a comedian\ " off my bucket list .... although technically I guess it was more like \ " coupled\ " out .... good times ! " 
whoever messed up the GC should just kill themselves ..... I've spent 2hrs trying to burn out whatever crap they got in it and have made no progress ! 
guess I should go back to being a cowboys fan , < PROPMALE > Phillips is gone and < PROPFIRST > romo isn't starting ..... 
The things you year in a hospital waiting room \We could have had a camaro ... but we had have a kid instead !! \"" 
guess I can't say nothing exciting ever happens in Kansas City , tonight is KSU vs Duke , a possible preview of the national championship ? I hope so ! 
feel like this is gonna be a long week .... 
UT finds new ways to amaze me every week .... I can't imagine < PROPMALE > will be the QB next year .... if he is then I mourn for my friends who are UT fans !! 
as much as it pains me to say , cam < PROPMALE > looks like a Heisman trophy winner today ! 
well now there is only 1 thing that could keep cam < PROPMALE > from winning the Heisman : proof he got paid to go to Auburn ... 
went to bed when boise st was up 24-7 at halftime , so you can imagine my surprise when i woke up and heard they lost ! ' bout damn time !! GO TCU Football !!! 
Game time ! Florida Gators at Florida State Seminoles !!! 
please help the Florida Gators and support this cause : Fire < PROPMALE > Addazio 
sometimes I wish I wasn't an only child , this is one of those times !!! 
TCU Football moving to the Big East is a bad move !!! the Big East is a weak conference , and the Mountain West is getting stronger ! Pit is the perennial power of the Big Least and they lost to Utah who got crushed by TCU . the big east doenst have a single team worthy of a BCS bowl ! and with Boise and < PROPFEMALE > moving to the Mountain West it is a much stronger conference than the Big East !! 
so I woke up to a pot of fresh Starbucks coffee and hot scones in the oven .... its times like this when I love living at home !! 
this is going to be a long and miserable weekend !!! 
never thought i'd say this but boomer sooner ! 
so everyone knows I'm an SEC fan but I hate cam < PROPMALE > and by extension auburn ... so it hurts me that I can't in good conscience pull for the SEC champion to win 
can it be Thursday already ? 
so I can write a FB status update that is \too long\ " yet I have writers block on my 10 < PROPFEMALE > research paper ??? This is bull shit !! " 
its amazing how just hearing the right song can ease your mind , therefore allowing you to get past the writers block that has killed your progress for so long ! 
hmm at ~ 1 < PROPFEMALE > per hr I still have ~ 7 hrs left .... I need to pick up the pace ... 
considering I got no sleep last night , today has gone quite well :) 
yeah short nap didn't help .... 
been awake for 45 of the last 48 hours ..... screw school , im never doing this again !! 
we will miss you Urban Meyer ! but moving forward < PROPFIRST > Mullen should be the next coach of the Florida Gators !! 
is it weird that in the last 2 months I've grown to despise weekends ? 
everyone knows that after the < PROPMALE > bush scandal you have to pay your players the same way you would make any other under the table payment : in cash or with gold coins ... they will probably never have any real evidence on Cam < PROPMALE > till his dad gets greedy/dumb and tries to move $200k in krugerrands ... 
store is sloww .... its gonna be a long day ..... can it just be tomorrow already ?? 
who would have thought the Florida Gators would hire Will Muschamp ?? on one hand its like kicking Texas while they are down , so i like it ! but i really wanted < PROPFIRST > Mullen to be the next coach ! 
my semester is officially O-V-E-R ! Guess now I just need to pray I got atleast a 2.5 :/ 
first D of my life ! Thank you Dr Distel .... 
headed to SA for the GRE ! 
just got home ... long day ! 
feeling creative ..... 
Tebow is starting today ... wish I could watch ! 
why is the 15 day forecast for central Texas warmer than Florida .... not fair that it gets cold down there just when I have to go !! Screw global warming ! 
it is morally wrong to compare cam < PROPMALE > to < PROPMALE > Tebow ! < PROPMALE > may be a great football player but he is not Tebow ! The NCAA never had to investigate anything Tebow did , and < PROPMALE > can't go 5 < PROPFEMALE > without cheating , stealing , lieing , or getting paid .... he's is the type of person that keeps negative stereotypes alive ! 
the high today is supposed to be 58 :/ 
ready for Friday ! wow i haven't said that since October .... and I'm looking forward to school starting back ... only one semester to go and i just want to get it started ! 
WORST CALL EVER ! A salute is not excessive celebration ! That was pure horse shit !! 
well Tennessee is playing their usual dirty football ! They are a disgrace to the SEC ! 
referees should either always call excessive celebration on every play or never at all ! There needs to be consistency !!!!
