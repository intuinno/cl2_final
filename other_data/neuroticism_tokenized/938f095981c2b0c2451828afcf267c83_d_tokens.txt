just got home from the movies ... watched piranha 3D with < PROPFEMALE > and had a great night !! :) 
Listening to a very inspirational song with my best friend swag 
getting off facebook . took some quizzes and got seven am class tomorrow so should def sleep now . night everyone :) 
still can't sleep !! ugh . 
so very truly tired and really upset about some things so work tomorrow and my arm still hasn't stopped bleeding yet . I had this tumor looking thing and i pushed it and it popped and won't stop bleeding so ..................................................................... g'night .

when you burn the candle at both ends it usually burns up really fast lol don't recommend it to anyone !! sleep then more to come 
so if i hadn't jumped the gun and gotten a phone that is huge and flip phone and old but it WORKS ,, i could have a brand new phone ... all i had to do was be home . what the hell ?? and was extremely sick this morning and was late for school .... getting sick doesn't count as an excuse unless you drive home , be more late , then get a note and return ... how dumb lol ... life 
everybody needs to be loved . making fun of people isn't cool because everyone that you may pass has to live their life just as you do yours . so next time you start to say something about someone think first and decide not too . and listen to friends because they may be going through something that they can't get over and need someone to care . just sayin so .. good night . -August
