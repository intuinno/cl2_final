Please put this on your status if you know or love someone who is gay . My wish is that people will understand that being gay is not a disease or a choice . People who are gay are not looking for a cure , they are looking for acceptance & equal rights . 93% of you won't copy & paste this ! Tolerance and acceptance must be taught to our children if anything is going to change !!!
