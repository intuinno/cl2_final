Ugh ... Three and a half hours of sleep and over ten hours in the car ... 

Is exhausted and loathes homework . >:( 
is very confused by the ITF's ranking system for the countries in this tournament . 
just saw the play and thought it was absolutely excellent ! <3 
got really excited today when I realized that there are similarities between \The Odessey\ " and \ " The Lion King . \"" 
I hate snow . 
I hate being sick . 
I now understand why sleep is so very important . 
Yay for \Baba O'Riley\ " ! The only part of the Super Bowl I consider worth watching . <3 " 
... Seamus just discovered that \did\ " is a palindrome . I really don't know how to react to this . " 
wonders if the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company provides the shrimp for prawn cocktail-flavored Taytos . 
The play was fantastic ! Excellent job to everyone involved , it was really great ! 
Lá fhéile Pádraig < PROPFEMALE > daoibh ! 
nearly collapsed three times in ten minutes . I seriously think it's time for this chair to become firewood . 
was bitten on the nose by a guinea pig this afternoon . 
Apparently my mother and her boyfriend are now married and are expecting a child due in October . I was going to get back at them somehow , but I just don't think I can top \Michael < PROPFIRST > Wargo III . \ " Such an interesting April Fool's Day . ^^ " 
I think that \Law & Order : Criminal Intent\ " has finally reached its dying day ; an incredible ( potential/probable ) end to my favorite show . ? " 
is going to see < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > on July 11th !!! 
got so excited when the catcher actually managed to make it to first base in tonight's game ! Yay for Ruiz !! 
The couch has officially eaten my phone . 
The phone is free ! And there was no surgical procedure on the couch ! =D 
Sitting outside , listening to < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , and writing poetry = time well spent . 
Yeah Ruiz !!! 10th run for the Phils ! <3 
AND RUIZ SCORES THE WINNING RUN !!!!!!!! YEAH CHUCHA !!!!! <3 
\It's probably not safe to go in the water if the penguins aren't in it . \ " Seriously ? WHERE does my brain come up with this stuff ? I was asleep ! And why in the world did my sleeping brain decide a pond should go in the middle of a classroom and there should be penguins there ?? " 
is putting waayyy too much effort into this story for world history . 
Needs red construction paper and is wondering why we have none . Colored pencils will have to do ... 
YEAH FLYERS !!!!!!! <3 
4-5 drunk < PROPFEMALE > women + 1 me + 2-3 small children + 1 trampoline = complete madness . 
is proud of the Flyers for giving it their best effort ; they'll make it next year !! <3 <3 <3 
Apparently my brother downloads potatoes . Yeah . 
just had her first ferry ride , first & second cab rides , AND first concert all in one night . < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , G . Love , and ALO were awesome , and the line to go back on the ferry was like , three < PROPMALE > long . My feet hurt and I have to be up in ... 3.5 to 4 hours for the ten or so hour car ride to NC . Fun stuff . xD 
The list of reasons why < PROPFIRST > Ruiz is my favorite baseball player just got a little bit longer . 
< PROPMALE > Thorpe was beautiful , absolutely adorable little town ; the old jail was sooo creepy , especially the basement where they had the solitary confinement cells ( and Cell 17 where the handprint of one of the < PROPFEMALE > Maguires is was pretty weird , too ); and I was just really close to a doe and two fawns ( like , 2-3 yards , maybe ) . 
Hickory Run State Park is absolutely beautiful , and the Boulder Field was amazing !!! I don't think I've ever seen so many rocks in one place ! 
just watched 16 innings of HELL . They had a pitcher playing left field , used up their ENTIRE bullpen , had the left fielder on first ' cause the first baseman was [ unjustly ] tossed , and the game was 5 HOURS LONG . And then they lost . Poor Phils ... At least they went down fighting . 
is just a little bit sad that it stopped raining . 
I think I just witnessed genuine madness . 
I think I just died three million times tonight . Deathly Hallows Part 1 = ABSOLUTE AMAZINGNESS . <3 
totally just watched a forty-year-old man play with < PROPFEMALE > Pockets . 
< PROPMALE > Rickman trying to do an < PROPFEMALE > accent is a wretched failure .
