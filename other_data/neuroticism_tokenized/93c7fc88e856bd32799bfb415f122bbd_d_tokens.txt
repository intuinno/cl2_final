So far in college I've learned that math midterm are horrible , that what they mean when they say that the midterm has 6 questions is that it has 6 < PROPFEMALE > s with 5-7 questions on each < PROPFEMALE > , and that chemistry midterms , luckily , aren't as bad as math midterms , not to mention more honest . 
Got an A on my in class essay on thucydides , apparently the key to a good essay in which the class has previously been assigned plato is to continuously ask questions throughout the essay , especially if the essay ends in questions . 
I really hate November , can't wait till December .
