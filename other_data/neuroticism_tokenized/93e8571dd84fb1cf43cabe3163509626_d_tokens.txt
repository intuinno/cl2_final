Then it all crashes down\ 
And you break your crown\ 
And you point your finger\

I can feel the animal inside\ 
My resolve is weakening\ 
Pounding on the doors of my mind\ 
It’s nearly overpowering\ 
I cannot begin to describe\ 
The hunger that I feel again\ 
Run if you intend to survive\ 
For the beast is coming to life 
* sigh * might just give up on football for this year because I've already missed so much , I'm really out of shape and my back STILL hurts . 
I quit football and now dad is giving me a ton of crap . 
I need to stop listening to the Dropkick Murphys .... 
And now you wish that you meant something\ 
And now you wish that you meant something to somebody else\ 
And now you wish that you met someone\ 
And now you wish that you meant something to somebody else 
Being sick suckkkkksssssss 
Just finished a second book in two weeks ... and now to wait until Tuesday for another one =) 
I'm sooo bored ..... 
Resolute a stance of defiance\ 
Always teetering on the brink\ 
Nothing can hold you back when\ 
WHEN YOU'RE NOT HOLDING BACK A THING\ 
Open arms we embrace tomorrow\ 
Closed fists , tarnishing today\ 
We're not afraid to open our mouths and scream :\ 
WE BELIEVE IN WHAT WE SAY

I can talk about love , \ 
I can talk about hate , \ 
I could try to teach a lesson but I doubt it penetrates , \ 
I can give you all excuses till I'm blue in my face , \ 
I can talk about serenity , but it doesn't mean a thing , \ 
I can talk about problems , \ 
I can talk about sin\ 
I can talk about trial , \ 
but what do we really win ? \ 
I can talk about forgiveness , \ 
though I'd probably be condemned\ 
Or I can talk about ... 
Put this as your status if you know , or are related to , someone killed on Alderaan when it was obliterated by the Death < PROPFEMALE > . The Rebel Alliance wants to bring peace to the galaxy , but the Galactic Empire continues to kill innocent civilians . Will you make this your status for at least 1 hour ?

There's a flag-pole rag and the wind won't stop

If someone from your past , whom made you're life hell , contacted you and tried to add you on FB , saying that that are sorry , would you add them ? \ 
I'm quite taken aback by this ... I find it rather disturbing ...

I don't know what's worth fighting for\ 
Or why I have to scream . \ 
I don't know why I instigate\ 
And say what I don't mean . \ 
I don't know how I got this way\ 
I know it's not alright . \ 
So I'm breaking the habit 
Any bets on school tomorrow ?
