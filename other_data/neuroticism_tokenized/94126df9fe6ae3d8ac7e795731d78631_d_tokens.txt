Do whatever the heck you want when the opportunity comes , because it might never happen again . 
I'm glad that so many people think that I like brownies , I would secretly fart in public , and that I sing < PROPFEMALE > Spears out loud .

NNNEEEEWWWWW RRRRROOOUUUUTEEERRRRR . 
Oh , hello , < PROPMALE > Potter weekend . It's nice to see you . 
So much for getting my sleeping schedule back on track . 
Had fun at the beach with Mom , < PROPFIRST > Elomaa , < PROPFEMALE > Elomaa , and < PROPMALE > . ALTHOUGH I did gain serious injuries . Fought a jellyfish off my leg with my bare hands . Don't worry . My hands are okay . Finding Nemo taught me to only touch the tops . But I do have a throbbing red < PROPFIRST > - I mean battle wound all the way around my leg . ( Taking pictures later for visual . ) 
If one more person offers to pee on my leg , I'm going to assume you are all secretly dogs . Ya know , like an animagus . 
Wake up in the morning with an upset stomach . Grab some tablets , I'm going to puke All over the kids at school . Before I leave , check my Facebook and tell this story . ' Cause when I leave for hell's pit , I ain't coming back . 
Home and bra-less . Life is good . 
NOOOOOO I accidentally deleted my status . DIE IN A FIRE FACEBOOK 
Teen Titans marathon for me . Thank you , Pirate Bay . 
For once , books are not my friends today . I hate heavy school textbooks . HATE them . 
Today has not been fun . 
I am so not inspired to write this autobiographical essay . Sorry , Ms. Douzart , I'm not interesting enough for this . 
So , apparently , I suddenly became attractive over the summer . 
Sleeping in and reading The Hunger Games . So much better than the week I just had . 
Go on Facebook . See every status is a quote from a mainstream song . Get off Facebook . 
THE NEXT TRUE BLOOD IS IN TWO WEEKS ? Die die die . 
I started singing a song and then my iTunes , on shuffle , switched to the next song and it was the song I was singing . 
< PROPFEMALE > Slaughter is back . Yippee . 
On the third book of the Hunger Games series . Can't stop , won't stop . I must be reading . 
Well , it's the end of September 1st and I'm not at Hogwarts . I guess I can say goodbye to being a seventh year witch and just stay at First Coast . 
Watching Order of the Phoenix & Half-Blood < PROPMALE > with Panduh Bear & < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > . 
Dancing bears , painted wings : Things I almost remember , And a song someone sings , Once upon a December . 
I kind of , sort of , maybe doodled all around the question about Pluto on my benchmark test today ... and I kind of , sort of , maybe doodled a picture of me hugging Pluto , telling him that it's okay to be abnormal and I still accept him as a planet ... Yeah . 
< PROPFIRST > , what are you doing ? Get away from the alphabet . I don't understand you when you're with them and I'm failing because of it . 
I thought I'd share : there are a lot of stories going around but the main point is that the Qur'an burning has been canceled . 
Um . Holy crap . The Vampire Diaries is crazy . Team < PROPMALE > . 
I think I may be using a straightener from now on . < PROPFEMALE > Sperry can be thanked for that . 
I hate being sick . Had some crazy fever dreams , can barely breathe through my nose . 
Recovering today and then back to school tomorrow . I know everyone must miss The Skyscraper's presence . 
Get a journal or a blog . Just please don't post paragraphs about it on Facebook . 
MySpace allows people to see who's viewing their profile now . Facebook , PLEASE do not copy them . I like being a stalker in peace . 
The Vampire Diaries tonight and Supernatural tomorrow night . Any chances of a life have gone out the window . Thanks , CW . 
... I'm just gonna go back to bed . 
POKEMON IS ON THE CW . 
Oh , right . Homecoming was yesterday . I was wondering why everyone was changing their profile pictures . I had more fun at a seven year old's birthday party anyway . :3 Thanks for the invite , Jarerah Beardmore . 
Um . I better see Static Shock , the Teen Titans , and the Power Puff Girls running around school tomorrow . I can't dress up as them or I totally would . 
Buried Life ! 
Slowly edging into the world of Doctor Who . Season one is a blast so far . 
My cell phone is cut off . I have a home phone . Yup . That's about it . This has been a status . 
Someone tell me it's a lie . They're saying < PROPMALE > Giraldo has passed away . 
LILO & STITCH IS ON DISNEY CHANNEL . :D 
No pants is the way to go . 
Hey you guys . Wake me up when September ends . 
Saw Easy A last night . I can pretty much guarantee that it was one of the best movies ever . 
Singing , dancing , soap and shampoo , and I didn't even slip . My shower was successful . Mission accomplished . 
Dear Firefox , please stop crashing . I know you probably think it's a cute way to make me give up and get offline , but YOU . ARE . MISTAKEN . 
Caffeine caffeine caffeine . 
Okay , Challenge Day people . I smell it . Something's up . Why won't anyone tell me what you guys did in that stinky gym ? 
Praise Grilled Cheesus . 
Ugh . The < PROPMALE > walk was so much fun . I got a free wand ! The guy was so awesome . :3 
So , I really really really want my bracelet , Panduh Bear ... 
Has anyone done the whole HAPPY BIRTHDAY , < PROPFIRST > LENNON status yet ? Well , if not , HAPPY BIRTHDAY , < PROPFIRST > LENNON ! And maybe you guys should check out Google . It wouldn't hurt to hover over the logo and click on it either . ;) 
Nightmares about spiders , pizza boxes , and a substitute teacher are fun . 
I'm pretty much sure they should have a zombie walk every month . 
i'm uploading the zombie walk photos slowly . brraaaiinnnsss . 
I got my phone back ! :3 My life is complete again . 
Living easy , loving free . Season ticket for a one way ride . 
I still need movie buddies for Deathly Hallows . People who have actually read the books and watched the movies preferably ... 
Survey : Keep the bangs or let them grow out ? 
I'm so tired of Pocketful of Sunshine being stuck in my head while I'm in the shower ... 
Successful night so far . My nephew now says \Hicka-bicka-boo\ " and I respond with \ " Hoo-sha . \ " then we do a cool fist bump . " 
http://cristgaming.com/pirate.swf - All day , errday . 
is in a relationship and it's complicated with Hungry Howie's Pizza . 
I want a zombie tattoo . 
Alright , I'll bite . Like this status and I'll tell you : 1 ) Something I've learned about you by looking at your wall for 13 seconds . 2 ) The color you remind me of . 3 ) My first memory of you . 4 ) The animal you remind me of . 5 ) Ask something I've always wondered about you . 6 ) My favorite thing about you . 7 ) Give you a weird nickname . 
What's on my mind , Facebook ? Well , I was wondering how I could eat Doritos and wash the dishes at the same time without getting suds in my mouth , but that's about it . 
Oh , right . There's school tomorrow .... Can't we just extend this three day weekend to forever and never go back ? 
What the heck ?! “This is an official notice that LimeWire is under a court-ordered injunction to stop distributing and supporting its file-sharing software . Downloading or sharing copyrighted content without authorization is illegal . ” 
Apparently I'm scary when I watch football . I can't help that the refs are wack and I like to scream at televisions . 
Welp , looks like I'm stuck at home . Locked up in my room with a book it is then . 
I'm not even going to ask why the Cheez-It box was sitting on the toilet seat . 
I saw < PROPFIRST > Marlow's < PROPFEMALE > . 
I want to go to < PROPFIRST > Marlow's house and play with his < PROPFEMALE > . :3 
< PROPFEMALE > Flores , < PROPFIRST > Marlow , and < PROPMALE > Pate need to come online and get on oovoo . There's an oovoo party being planned without you guys !

Oh . 
Jarerah didn't suspect a thing ... Well , maybe a little . But it was the best surprise ever . :) 
Watching the Walking Dead . I love zombies . 
So ... My new name is Laurent . 
Practically forcing < PROPMALE > Pate to dive into the world of < PROPMALE > Potter , and the deal is that I have to watch something about a north < PROPFEMALE > and a fist or something . I think I can handle it . 
HE'S BAM MARGERA . HE LOVES TO SKATE ... He also likes to shake things up a bit . 
We president now . 
Tall skinny yet not so skinny girls need jeans , too , clothing stores . 
I really miss my cell phone . It's cut off for now , everyone . If you're trying to get a hold of me , ask for my house phone number . 
DEATHLY HALLOWS WAS AMAZING . 
Hahahaha snort ... And then I was pig . 
< PROPFIRST > Ethridge gave me a full sleeve sharpie tattoo . It's pretty legit ... and REALLY HARD to wash off . 
Ah ! Deathly Hallows tonight . Not going , but I did see it on Monday so it's all good . :) 
Hanging out with Celest ' Rivera . We're looking at pictures and gonna bake cookies . :) 
I've lived in Florida for most of my life and I've never been to Disney World . : c 
After school cereal . Apple Jacks are the best . 
Finished Easy A , now on to Whip It . I love how eventful my life is this holiday week off . 
Baking brownies and possibly cupcakes , trying to figure out if I'm going to < PROPFIRST > Marlow's . I'd suggest someone coming to get me if they want the sweets . ;) 
:D 
Me : \I don't even know him ! \ " - < PROPMALE > Chaya : \ " So ? You don't need to know people to send happy faces to them ! \""

\369 friends\ " . I don't know if I'm giggly about the 69 part or the consecutive multiples of 3 . " 
< PROPMALE > Studt as he walks out of my room : \Later . I'm gonna go abuse children . \"" 
I'm making it a goal to somehow get to Moe's this week . I need it .

Wacky Wednesday ! 
< PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > d , n < PROPMALE > dy ! :) 
Cooking food with Panduh Bear , < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFIRST > Ethridge . :) I THINK it's going well ... 
< PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > is walking around in my boots and my hat . Playing the waiting game until he comes close enough for me to pinch his cheeks . c : 
I don't abuse EVERYONE ... 
Pulling pranks on chatroulette with Jarerah Beardmore and < PROPFIRST > McCoy . My face hurts from laughing , omg . 
God , I'm so sexy . It's good to be Iron Man . 
Everyone should automatically know not to call me before noon on the weekend . Come on now . 
Standing innocently with my new jacket on and suddenly I hear \Do do do do do inspector gadget ! \ " I think people are finally catching on . I'll just be Iron Man and Inspector Gadget on the side . " 
Spaghetti Week . :) 
The Icarus Account was great and I loved all of the other bands and I'm just really excited still because I met them and got a picture and a signed shirt and a CD and fhjsgakfjgashjkjafglsmhfjkaq . :) 
Woke up with only one sock on and can't find the other ... SOCK GNOMES . 
Hanging out with < PROPFIRST > McCoy . Going to see TRON . :) 
Drove around some neighborhoods with < PROPFIRST > McCoy looking at Christmas lights and listening to Christmas music . :) 
IT'S MUFFIN TIME . 
Everyone should just come over to my house and we'll go to Kingsley where there aren't any streetlights and we can watch this lunar eclipse thing . 
About to be sipping hot chocolate from my Twilight cup ... Oh , look , what a lovely Eclipse . 
I think < PROPFIRST > Cullen is watching me from the shadows . It's freaking creepy out here . 
Just beating up < PROPMALE > Pate as usual . :) 
I'm gonna have another little niece . :) 
You think I'm gooorgeous . You want to kiiiiss me . You want to huuuuug me . You want to loooove me . You want to huuuug me . You want to smooooch me . 
Ever since I can remember , I've been poppin ' my collarrr . Poppin ' , poppin ' my collar . Poppin ' , poppin ' my collar . 
I had a dream that I met J.K. Rowling . We partied . Pretty much one of the best dreams I've ever had . 
Is anyone else tracking < PROPFEMALE > , or am I the only dork doing that ? 
The male population is stupid . 
Oh ho ho . Oovoo's allowing free 6-way video calls until the 2nd . You know what that means ! :) 
I live on a river . We don't get snow . We get rain . I'm going back to bed . 
Watched Get Him to the Greek , Despicable Me , and The A-Team . Great movies . Now on to ... Kick Ass ? Movie Days in bed are awesome . 
VersaEmerge tonight . :D 
I miss Daylight Savings Time whenever I could sleep all day and still have some sunshine left to wake up to . 
Can all guys be 6'0\ and up so I don't feel like I'm diminishing their man pride whenever I'm around them ? " 
People complaining about Facebook stalkers ... YOU put your information on the internet for them to see , I don't know why you're so surprised . 
Another dream about zombies . This time I seemed to be the most angry about not getting to be a sniper . 
< PROPFIRST > Esposito Driggers and I are making spaghetti . No one made me promise not to throw food this time . Aaaand here comes the mess . 
Why didn't I google \How to dress as a tall girl\ " a long time ago ? These girls know my pain . " 
Somehow , I went to take a nap six hours ago and I'm just waking up now ... Six hour nap ? 
So , my dad's sitting at the computer playing poker and he sarcastically snaps at the screen : \Thanks BRO ! \ " ... What have I done ?! " 
Urge to curl up in bed and cry my eyes out ? Titanic it is . 
Guilt tripping should be illegal . 
Codename : Kids Next Door is on . :D 
Hanging out in a cramped < PROPFIRST > with Panduh , < PROPMALE > , Ally , < PROPMALE > , and < PROPFIRST > . 
Mean Girls is on TBS ! I have no idea why , but I plan on watching it . I don't need sleep . 
Some Ramen then a nap ? Sounds like a good afternoon . 
\Coming Soon : Your New Profile . In the next few days you'll be upgraded to the new profile 
How I manage to run into EVERY possible object and make a ton of noise when I'm trying to creep through the house and be quiet is beyond me . 
\Introducing Your New Profile\ 
I wish I was a guy during the winter so I could pee standing up . The toilet seat is so cold . 
I'm tired of accepting friend requests from people I don't know . Just because we have a ton of mutual friends and you've seen my head above everyone else's at school doesn't mean you know me , sorry . 
So tired . Wish there could've been a party at < PROPMALE>'s forever ... PARTY AT BILL'S TOMORROW . 
When you burp so loud the whole house can hear it . 
Skins USA is the stupidest thing I've ever seen . All of you , indulge yourself in the UK version . 
Aahh . Can they just have a summer school that I can go to that's like Hogwarts ? I don't even care about the magic part ( though it would be cool to be a wizard ); I just want to go there . 
It's such a beautiful day . Is anyone up to riding around ? 
My horoscope ... IT KNOWS . 
I really want to watch Remember Me . I haven't seen it in a while ... I don't need sleep , right ? 
No matter how many times I close my Physics book and reopen it , the problems don't look any easier . Maybe if I just got to bed now and cuddle with it , I'll dream up the answers . 
I could really use a sandwich right now , sandwich right now , sandwich right now . 
HAHAHA . I'm watching old videos from 2009 and my brother really did sound like me before puberty . No wonder you guys got us mixed up on the phone all the time , oh my god . 
We interrupt this program to bring you ... Courage the Cowardly Dog Show ! Starring Courage : the cowardly dog ! 
< PROPFEMALE > studt's facebook has been hacked by her beloved brother from another mother that is like no other :))

\Here's some advice . Stay alive . \"" 
Everybody wish < PROPMALE > Studt a very happy birthday . :D 
Expect a marriage request , < PROPMALE > . 
This is the last time < PROPFIRST > , Jarerah , and I will < PROPFEMALE > out in my room with me for a long while . :/ 
Why do people talk on the phone while they use the bathroom ? ESPECIALLY in public bathrooms , of all places ? 
What the heck is The National Society of High School Scholars ? This must be a scam , because they think I'm smart or something . 
< PROPFIRST > McCoy just called me from his bus . I think I'm gonna cry again . :/ 
I can't sleep . :/ 
I'm so incredibly tired and stressed out . I think I just want to cuddle or something . 
I hate being at the end of the alphabet . I'm always last . And this time that means that I have to take a very long test on a Friday . 
I just really want a burrito . 
Facebook Chat wants to be stabbed so badly . 
I'm watching my VHS of Tarzan and going to sleep . I feel much better now then I had at the beginning of the week . I love weekends . :) 
< PROPFIRST > Pratuhtuh . 
Just pulled over and looked at the < PROPFEMALE > s with < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > . We saw a shooting < PROPFEMALE > . Boo yaaa . And I have a lot of fun with Panduh Bear , < PROPFEMALE > Pratt , and < PROPFIRST > Pratt today . MUCH better than the beginning of this week . 
It's 72 degrees outside ? Everyone's enjoying the day ? I'll just lay in bed and read a book then . 
Seeing is deceiving , dreaming is believing . It’s okay not to be okay . 
Celest ' was hereeeee ? I love you sooooo much ! :) 
HAWKWARD . 
I just spent the entire school day sleeping . That was much more productive than actually spending it at school . :) 
Jacksonville.com photographer sees us for the second time at < PROPMALE > Walk tonight : \You guys haven't gotten arrested yet ? \"" 
< PROPFEMALE > can never have a good day 101 . 
< PROPFEMALE > is a loser ! Jk . Not really . Jk . Seriously . Jk . 
... I'm going back to sleep . 
I really don't feel like poking all of you back . 
My iPod's okay ! :D I let it dry out and it seems to work fine . I think things may be looking up a little bit . I have hope . Today is going to be a good day . 
You put the \cool\ " in Tentacool . " 
Stealers ? Why are you guys rooting for thieves ? And Packers ? Do they pack the things that the Stealers steal ? Am I missing something ? 
Welp . Slash was the highlight of that seizure . 
I just really want a pair of rain boots . And some waffles .

I have something to say . I've been silent on this matter for a while now , yet I think it's well known to the recipient ... I love you . There . I said it . I can't live without you . And it sucks to know that you comfort me by leaving me , but you leaving me is the best comfort . And you're not really leaving me ... You'll be inside of me . <3 You're the best . I'll eat you forever , Chocolate . 
I just want to sleep forever and forget everything . 
Sleepovers are the best . 
I think it's time for a nap . 
I think I'm officially sick . Thanks , guys . : c No concert for me tonight . I'm gonna catch up on all of my TV shows and sleep forever . 
Woo ! Soup Party ! 
< PROPMALE > Potter movie night > English Project 
Beach tomorrow ? Who's up for it ? 
Jarerah Beardmore : \I think you need to go to pizza rehab . You eat too much pizza . \""

FINALLY watched the movie that you can't talk about all the way through . Took me forever . Thanks , < PROPFIRST > Pratt . 
Sniffling my way through this Saturday . I wish I were Voldemort because then I wouldn't have this problem .

Awesome . They're showing the original Yu-Gi-Oh on the CW Saturday mornings . I might actually wake up early on the weekends more often . 
I have 6,000 songs on my iTunes ... I need to calm down . I don't even listen to half of this . 
Sleep . The only thing I'm good at most of the time . 
BUG'S LIFE ON ABC FAMILY ! Today is a good day . Ice Age , Aladdin , and now A Bug's Life . c : 
Breakfast for dinner . c : 
Why are there so many clothes for me to put away ? And they're all on my bed ... I think I'll just crawl under them and go to sleep . Blankets are so mainstream . 
I love Fernandina . 
Party at Skyler's! Who's coming ? 
< PROPFEMALE>'s on ABC Family . :D 
What a super day ... Now it's time for some super soup , a super shower , and some super sleep .

\We we we so excited . \ " says < PROPFEMALE > . Black Friday tomorrow ! " 
There's this goose outside vying for my attention . He won't stop honking so I started imitating him out my window and now he won't shut up . 
Me : I just wanna sleep . Panduh Bear : That sucks . ' Cause you're gonna watch Pocahontas . 
I'm just gonna sleep by myself while Panduh and < PROPMALE > cuddle on the floor . Whatever , Panduh . That's fine . I didn't wanna cuddle . 
I'm going to create a cocoon of blankets and pillows on my bed to act as a fortress to keep away all my problems . This should be a nice nap . 
I have to pee . Does that mean I'm getting up anytime soon ? Nope . 
< PROPFIRST > McCoy just called me . He's graduating soon , you guys . :D 
Accepting applications for new friends who are taller than 5'11 & 1/2\ . You midgets aren't cuttin ' it anymore . You make me feel extra large . " 
I'm pretty much the only person who thinks a dislike button would be a REALLY bad idea . 
Had a super awesome day as a super awesome hero . 
Later , pants . I don't need you anymore . 
The only clear space to walk in my room is from the door to my bed . I should probably take the term \spring cleaning\ " and put it to use in my activities . " 
Figures that I would start making a grilled cheese and forget that I broke the spatula a couple of weeks ago ... Time to improvise . 
I don't need friends . All I need is celery . 
God , I wish we would have had school for April Fool's Day . The amount of < PROPMALE > Potter pranks that could have been pulled ... 
Ugh jfhasdkjfoafa < PROPFEMALE>'s chocolate frosty , let me love you . And by love , I mean devour .
