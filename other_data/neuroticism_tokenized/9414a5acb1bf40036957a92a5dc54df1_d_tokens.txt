Hello . Volleyball game tomorrow . Home , Zion at 5 . 
I can breathe , without you dear ; just start walking away . 
really likes volleyball .. and soccer . < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > brought me into the light . 
Do you know what's worth fighting for , when it's not worth dying for ? Does it take your breath away and you feel yourself suffocating ? Does the pain weigh out the pride ? And you look for a place to hide ? Did someone break your heart inside ? You're in ruins . 
I tried to be chill , but you're so hot that I melted . 
is .. itchy . 
Lady Gaga is so dramatic (: 
So baby keep my heart beat b-beat beat beating . 
Still smiling ..

Fireflies . 
Pour me a heavy dose of atmosphere . 
I don't even know . 
You would not believe your eyes , if 10million fireflies , lit up the world as I fell asleep . 
When < PROPFEMALE > eyes get brighter , and heavy wings grow lighter , I'll taste the sky and feel alive again . And I'll forget the world that I knew , but I swear I won't forget you . Oh if my voice could reach back through the past , I'd whisper in your ear , \Oh darling I wish you were here . \"" 
GNI ! shopping tomorrow , please ?

In life it's not about how many breaths you have taken ; it's about how many moments have taken your breath away .

< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > just spent at least 10 minutes trying to convince me that there was a green thing growing in his pants drawer . 
went shopping today to get < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > all spiffied up for homecoming (: 
I watch the night turn light blue , but it's not the same without you , because it takes two to whisper quietly . 
Poetry should be great and unobtrusive , a thing which enters into one's soul , and does not startle it or amaze it with itself , but with its subject . - < PROPFIRST > Keats 
doesn't know if she is going to homecoming . Blame < PROPFIRST > Ariagno .

Between the lines of fear and blame , you begin to wonder why you came . 
Boston by Augustana 
Highlight of the night : Making fun of everyone in the theatre and ruining the movie .

Times Square can't shine as bright as you . 
is studying for exams and baking choc . chip cookies :D 
Even the best fall down sometimes . 
Take it from me : Love has all the lasting permanence of a rainbow - beautiful while it's there , and just as likely to have disappeared by the time you blink . 
Maybe , someday , we'll live our lives out loud .
