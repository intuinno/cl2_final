Almost have everything unpacked and put away . 
Finally have internet at the house . 
Cleaning house and doing laundry before working on < PROPFIRST>'s birthday plans . 
Getting ready for tonight . I'll be glad to have my hubby home for 3 consecutive days ! 
Getting ready to go out for the day with my hubby and kiddos . 
Getting the laundry finished up and then heading to bed . 
Cleaning house and leveling a lowbie on WoW . 
getting the kids ready for bed . 
Getting laundry done and trying to decide what I want to do for my birthday on Saturday . 
Getting the house and laundry done so we can go to bed early tonight . Going out for my birthday tomorrow . 
Thanks for all the birthday wishes . I had a great one ! 
Getting everything ready for < PROPFIRST>'s 1st birthday party on Thursday . 
Kids are in bed so I'm gonna run randoms on Caelestrasz to get Madisson's gs above 5k . Come join the fun if you're bored ! 
Doing laundry and getting the house clean . Then working on some stuff for < PROPFIRST>'s party on Thursday . 
Finally decided what degree I'm going to go for . Now , just have to decide exactly when I'm going back to school . 
I've just gotta get my hubby to mow the lawn while I finish making food and straightening the last little bit and then we're all ready for < PROPFIRST>'s party . 5:30 tomorrow at our place ! Let me know if you're coming so I can make sure I've got enough food ! 
Last batch of blondies are in the oven and boy do they smell amazing ! Heading to bed as soon as they're done . Gotta be up with the birthday boy and then spend the day putting finishing touches on his party stuff ! I can't believe my last baby's turning 1 ! 
It's hard to believe that < PROPFIRST > is 1 year old today . Just a year ago I was getting very upset with my doctor because they kept telling me that he wasn't ready to be born yet . However , we were fairly sure that my duedate was wrong and infact I was overdue . 
The party went well and the birthday boy is passed out in bed . 
Oh no ... Dorian's eyeing the leftover cake . 
Getting ready to have some friends over . Probably going to set up the pool for the kids so that should be fun . 
Taking it easy today . Might be doing something this evening but I'm so exhausted I really need to veg out for a while . 
not even 5pm and I'm ready for bed . Hopefully I can get the kids to bed and then turn in early tonight ! 
Getting the kids stuff packed for a week at grandma's . 
Xander and Triniti are at mom's for the week . < PROPFIRST>'s in bed . Hubby leaves for < PROPMALE > in the morning . What on earth am I going to do all week ??? 
I need copies of the other photos that were taken at < PROPFIRST>'s party so I can have a full album ! Send them my way , please ! 
< PROPFIRST > is shaking drops of milk out of his sippy cup onto his cereal before he eats it . lol . 
< PROPFIRST>'s getting home for the weekend tonight and we're picking the kids up from moms . It'll be nice to have a full house again ! 
Ok , we need to get our car fixed and it's going to cost $350 that we do not have right now . It's completely out of commission until we can get it fixed . Please , pray that we can come up with the money . 
Getting ready for this evening . My little brother's coming over ! 
Had a good visit with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > . Now , off to get some much needed sleep . 
Car's fixed ! 
getting ready to < PROPFEMALE > out with friends 
getting ready to go to J's dad's for the picnic and fireworks . 
J's sick :( 
Almost over this illness ... I think . 
Cleaning house and doing laundry .

July 31 , 2004 
Trying to figure out what to do for our 6th wedding anniversary tomorrow . 
Well , today marks the 6 year anniversary of the day I married < PROPFIRST > . I can honestly say I'm looking forward to many many more :) 
spending a few days up at my dad's house . 
back home now . It's good to see < PROPFIRST > :) I really hate that he has to travel for work . 
I have carried a\ 
child within my body . I have comforted my child upon my chest . My body\ 
is NOT magazine perfect , but when I look in the mirror I see a MOTHER , \ 
and there is no greater HONOR or BLESSING . Make this your status if you\ 
are proud to be a mother !! 
Xander starts school in the morning . I don't know if I'm more nervous or excited . He's very nervous but is convinced that his Ironman backpack is the coolest in existence . 
Sorry about not posting an update sooner . Our internet went out temporatily but it looks like we've got it back up and running again . Xander's first day went well . He's very excited about school and has already made some new friends that he wants to invite over to play . 
Xander was up before the alarm and clamoring to get ready for school so he wouldn't be late . I'm glad to see him so excited . 
Well , Xander got his first yellow card sent home today for pushing another child while standing in line . Hopefully this doesn't become a trend . 
It's 11am and I'm already ready for a nap . 
2 days without a yellow card . Looks like he's decided to behave lol . 
Had a blast at the Renaissance Festival yesterday . Hopefully we'll get to go again in a few weeks . 
Getting ready to head up to the in-laws for a grill out . 
Getting Triniti ready to go spend some time at her Papaw's house . 
Missing my babygirl but I'm sure she's having a blast at Papaw and < PROPFEMALE>'s house . 
I seriously wish my throat would stop hurting and I would stop sneezing . 
on 9-11-01 I was sitting in Mr. Merk's business law class when a < PROPFEMALE > came over the intercom to turn all tv's to a certain news station . I don't think I've ever heard an entire High school go completely silent before or since that day . 
Uh-oh . Blue card today :( He'd better straighten up at school or he's gonna end up not getting his Prize in 2 weeks . 
He was good at school today . YAY . 
Well , Xander got sent to the principal's office today for poking people with his pencil andcrawling under his desk . looks like he's lost his Prize . 
he was blue again today . What's up with him ths week ! 
Xander's very excited . He's about to lose his first tooth . 
Xander was blue again today but it was only for talking too much instead of pushing other kids so this is at least an implrovement . 
Xander was good at school today ! 
Xander's off to school . Time to make necklaces with Triniti while < PROPFIRST > plays . 
Xander ended the week with a Green card :) 
cleaning house , doing laundry , and getting ready for the weekend . 
Today is Xander's kindergarten picture day . Hopefully he smiles nice and sits up straight . < PROPFIRST > has decided that walking is the way to go unless he's trying to run away from mommy . Then he drops down on all fours and speeds away . Triniti thinks she rules the roost and is insisting on being called < PROPFEMALE > Triniti . 
Xander got 3 reen cards this week . That's an improvement :) His progress report was really good , too . 
It would be nice if the sun would show up at some point . This weather's making me sleepy . 
Xander and Triniti are at the < PROPMALE > Evans Farm Festival with my mom . < PROPFIRST>'s napping and < PROPFIRST > is in the basement . Wow , it's quiet . 
It's couples week . Copy and paste when you got together ... September 24 , 2003 ... Married July 31 , 2004 . 
It's hard to believe my baby boy is 6 years old today . 
It's Mommy week ! Post this with the date you first became a Mommy ...? ? October 18 , 2004 ? ?

Happy Thanksgiving everyone ! 
Getting ready for the AHO Christmas party . 
Getting ready to head out to lunch and to the store . 
Snow day yesterday . 2 hour delay today . I must say it's been nice having the whole family together for a couple of extra days . 
I really need this weather to stop . J can't work when it's this cold so he's out of work until it warms up a < PROPMALE > . We really need the money so ... c'mon stop with this coldness already . 
Busy day yesterday . Had Christmas at mom's and then went out with J to see Tron . 
Xander has had 2 green cards in a row . Lets hope he's finally out of his rotten streak ! 
Due to < PROPFIRST > starting a new job , we will not be able to do any traveling for Christmas . < PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone . Sorry we can't make it . 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone . 
Xander started yesterday with a green card and he got the homework award . Lets hope today goes just as well . 
Xander got 2 green cards this week and the rest were yellow . Good news is .. yellow is the worst he got and the yellows were only for things like getting out of his seat once . 
2 green cards so far this week for Xander . He's on a roll :D 
After watching several people almost wreck on my road , I am no longer questioning the snow day . 
My question is this ... if school's closed , why on earth take down the posting when people are trying to get their kids ready for school ? Naturally we're going to assume ( since it's no longer posted ) that there is school ! 
A little boy in Xander's class unexpectedly lost his father on Friday . Please , keep this family in your thoughts and prayers as they go through this difficult time . 
So the interview went well but the job isn't as flexible as I was lead to believe during the phone interview so we're figuring out if I am going to be able to take the job offer or not . 
Dear Snow , I'm sick of you . It would be in the best interest of everyone if you would just go away . 
Well , I think we're all finally completely better so I'm scrubbing down the house today to get rid of all the germs . 
I can't believe my baby girl will be 5 in 6 days . 
Triniti's 5th birthday is on Monday but we're going to have her party on the 12th . Probably at < PROPFEMALE > Corral in the party room . Lemme know if you're wanting to attend . 
It's amazing how a bit of snow and clouds can make a person feel so overly exhausted . 
Happy Valentines Day . 
Lasagna's in the Oven . Breadsticks are ready to be poped in as soon as the Lasagna's done . Pecan pie and Peanut butter and fudge bars are in the fridge . This should be a good Valentines Day dinner . 
So far Xander's doing really well with his behavior at school this week . Lets hope he keeps it up . 
So far Xander's had all green cards this week . Lets hope today is another good day ! 
I will be so glad when I get back in shape cause right now these workouts are killing me .

The kids are mostly better from their colds , Xander's doing really well in school this week , and < PROPFIRST > was able to send in his resume for a very good job . So far , this week has been pretty good . Now , lets just hope < PROPFIRST > gets the job lol .

Had a bad day yesterday and today's not looking any better .. oh joy . 
Banana 
I'm thinking of getting my hair cut . The uber long hair is driving me absolutely insane . 
Xander's off to school so it's time to get the rest of the family ready to go grocery shopping and such . Hopefully it stops being so overcast today , it's making me sleepy . 
How in the world am I sleepy and energetic at the same time ? This makes no sense . 
Dear Snow , \ 
It is a few hours until April . Go away ! \ 
Sincerely , \ 
Ohio 
You and I wake up in a psychiatric < PROPMALE > together . Using four words , what would you say to me ? Note : If you comment , you must copy and paste this to your status , so I may comment on yours as well . Be a good sport and play along . Four words is harder than you think 
It's scary to think that < PROPFIRST > will be 2 in 2 months . When I realize things like this I have to remind myself that 3 kids is FAR more than enough ..... but I will miss the baby days . 
It's a nice day so far . Hopefully it'll get warm enough to take < PROPFIRST > and Triniti to the park while Xander's at school . 
Another nice warm day . I wonder if Spring has decided to stop teasing us and actually stay this time . 
Ok , I love the warm weather . However , I am not in love with the fact that it's making my skin act like it's meant for a teenager . 
I've either got a bad cold or allergies acting up and the kids are running wild today . Haha go figure . 
I just had Xander pick out which of his baby pictures he wanted to send in for his Kindergarten Graduation slide show . It's amazing how quickly 6 years have gone .... he was barely the size of a football when he was born and now he's nearly to my shoulders . I often stop and stare at him because he says some of the most astounding things . It's hard to believe that this super intelligent 6 year old is my son . 
What a nice day today . I think I'm gonna take the kids out to play after I finish up the housework . 
A 15 year old girl holds her1-year old son ; people call her a slut , but nobody knew she was raped at the age13 . Make fun of someone because they are fat , but you don't know they have a serious health condition that causes her to be fat . Call the old guy ugly , but you don't know he got a serious face injury after serving his country ... or saving someone's life . Re- post this if you're AGAINST bullying 
Making dinner then finishing up laundry . Probably playing D&D tonight , Should be fun . 
Time to head to bed . Yardwork and laundry tomorrow . Hopefully I'll have time to squeeze in something fun . 
Nearly done with the laundry and then hopefully I'll have some time to relax tonight . Xander's spring break starts tomorrow , I'd better conserve my energy lol . 
If I turn on the AC it gets too cold . If I turn on the heat it gets too warm and if I just turn everything off it gets really humid . grrrr . 
I just made some of the best spaghetti with garlic biscuits . Yum ! 
I know it's a nice day and all but could all of the motorcycles choose another road to go down ?! Hours and hours of pretty much nonstop motorcycle noise is getting really annoying . 
Apparently , taking my one-a-day and then being around cleaning chemicals makes me queasy when neither of them do separately lol . How strange . 
Triniti's Kindergarten registration/screening is on Monday . I dunno what I'm gonna do with my two oldest in school . 
Rain rain go away . I want my pretty weather back . 
To all my FB friends , in honor of Mother's Day I'm trying to see how many of you are willing to change your profile picture to a picture of your mother and keep it there till May 9 . I did and so have several others . If you will and like this idea , please re-post this as your status so everyone gets the word and see how many beautiful mothers we can get on FB . Happy Mother’s Day to all beautiful moms there ! 
I just got my first hand made Mothers Day card and gift from Xander . I'll have to get out my camera and post some pics of it .
