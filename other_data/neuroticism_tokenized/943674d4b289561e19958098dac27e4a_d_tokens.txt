Oh there is only one thing that makes me crazy 
Galations : 7-9 7 : Be not deceived ; God is not mocked : for whatsoever a man soweth , that shall he also reap . 8 : For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption ; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting . 9 : And let us not be weary in well doing : for in due season we shall reap , if we faint not . 
Getting psyched for NaNoWriMo ! 50,000 word novel here I come !

My heart is so full right now <3 
Trying like mad to pump out as many words as I can while still making sense . Go Go Gadget Fingers !!

I don't know where it's all coming from-this barrage of fantastical thoughts-but I only have 10,000 more to go ! Agh ! * whispers * Seven days ....

Feeling really blessed and loved <3

Had a grrrrreat day ! 
R . I . P Rev . :( The inspiration you gave others was monumental 
Past misfortune should not color the rest of your life . Introspection is crucial . Who are you ? Why are you here ? What do you want ? Tears can take the form of the poison you have so desperately wanted to suck out of your being . 
Someone's pain , someone's tear , someone's dream , someone's happiness- empathize and it becomes a part of you as well . 
Loving life and looking forward to the future with a smile <3 
Welcomes Sakura and < PROPFEMALE > to the family :D They are the cutest little things ever . Even if their squeeky ball kept me up all night . <3 
Bad day > < Burned myself .. AGAIN ; back hurts , and I can't think of a single thing that I would enjoy doing right now . * sigh 
is feeling amazingly accomplished . Worked more on the song with < PROPFIRST > , and it's coming along nicely :D 
Working on the song that haunts my dreams ... literally . I wake up and it's in my head . WE WILL FINISH !!! 
Props to all those lyricists who knew just how to coordinate words and music . 
Life is a freeway . There are so many exits . Make sure you choose the one that will lead you the right way to your destination . 
If you have a wonderful husband , fiance , or boyfriend that works hard to take care of you and would do anything for you , then repost this as your status to give the honest good men out there the recognition that they deserve . Because great men are few and far between , and I have one of them ? 
EARTHQUAKE !!!!! 
Loves her fiance !!! <3 
<3 < PROPFIRST > 
Has a very full life <3 
I miss my family already , and I haven't even left yet <3 
UUuuuuuuuuuuuuuuummmmm ...... nothing 
Yay ! < PROPMALE > Croce \Lover's Cross\ " ^_^ " 
Getting settled in Colorado ... so much to dooooooo ! 
wait ... I'm c < PROPFEMALE > ing my status again to :\ 
I miss my family !!! I'm soooo proud of you < PROPFEMALE > !!! I love you !!! \ 
< PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > in there ! I'm so full of pride . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > , go go gadget ! I'm so happy you are in school ! \ 
I miss you all !!! <3 
GOT A JOB !!!!! Start my first 8 hour shift on Wednesday at the amazing STARBUCKS !!! yay for 4:30 am-1pm shift ( no I don't regret it ! ) Call me crazy , but that is the shift I requested ! ^_^ 
Ok , so , this is gonna sound off for those of you who know me as a tennis player : I just joined a woman's softball team . No . I will not be pitching , but thankfully i have about 10 other ways I can make an idiot out of myself ^_^ 
Possessions are Meaningless 
There is this saying- \burning the candle at both ends \"- practicing it isn't the best idea in the world . " 
There is just something so satisfactory about cleaning . It makes me tingle 
Just got off the phone with her good friend < PROPFIRST > !!!!! It was an amazing conversation . 
Finally !!!!! I have a date set !!!! :D <3 
Got my tattoo !!!! <3 And my new bicycle :D 
Smell the burning embers ; time flickering away ... 
Just had the most amazing back massage . Thanks , < PROPFEMALE > ! :D 
Massive fail morning .... * sigh 
Going to the ZOO !!!!! ^_^ 
is NOT going to the ZOO > < 
Is brushing her toofies while updating that she went bowling tonight , and bowled the worst game in the history of the universe 
.... 
Had a massage , shopped for < PROPFIRST > , cleaned a little , and now burning a Balsam Fir candle ... mmmm mmmm last day off before work week begins again . 
Trust in the Lord with all thine heart ; and < PROPFEMALE > not unto thine own understanding . In all thy ways acknowledge Him and He shall direct thy path . Be not wise in thine own eyes ; fear the Lord , and depart from evil . \ 
~ Proverbs 3:5 -7 
has come to realize time and again that she is engaged to the best man ever ! That is all . <3 
Went to the ZOO !!!!! Aminals ... aminals , and more aminals ... :D 
Playing < PROPFEMALE > of War with my love . < PROPFEMALE > Craft 2 is out in 2.5 hours !!! Most amazing 2 nights ever ! 
Love is a tricky , tricky concept 
Spent money I shouldn't have , but it was one of those things that we do so that we can breathe easily again . Does that make sense ? In a weird way , I suppose . So , the circle gets the square ... 
Thanks , < PROPFEMALE > , for making me miss you guys more than I already do . * applause * 
So , woke up this morning all psyched to go to work , and found that I couldn't get out of bed unless I rolled over and slid out . Standing is less painful than walking , and only slightly worse than sitting down .. what's wrong ? Well , I'll have a doctor tell me all about it at 3:15 . > < 
Just got back from the doctor's office . I have a slipped disk in my L4 vertebrae . Taking two forms of medication , and I plan to be back at work on Thursday ! :D 
Is feeling a bit better than yesterday . Most of that is no doubt owed to the pain meds , which I can't take before work or I'll be a useless limp noodle . 
Not hungry , but need to eat ; not tired , but need to sleep ; want to be strong , but need to weep ; how frustrating is the life that we keep ? 
Hanging out with her hunny and good friend < PROPFIRST > . A lovely evening of relaxation after a full day of work . 
Trying to calm down the irritation that has been building up because she can't do anything physically exhausting for fear of screwing up her already messed up back . If there is anyway to mentally burn 1000 calories in 3 hours , please , world , let me know . 
My < PROPFIRST > is amazing !! Even as crippled and lop-sided as he is , he still sounds amazing on the drums . <3 
One day , one night , one moment ; my dreams could be tomorrow . 
Homesick and injured ... I can't imagine going through this if I was completely alone . 
I am a lucky , happy girl today <3 
Tried on some old contacts . Now her eyes are dried out . RUNNY NOSE !!!! > < 
needs a vacation from the world .. life ... just to breathe 
THE GAME !!!!!! 
P.S. for the last wall post , I thank Hancock ! 
Apparently , sleep deprivation does wonders for my mood . 
Count down till Avenged Sevenfold concert has now commenced . <3 <3 <3 
Oooooooooooooooooo I better not be sick for the concert .... > < 
Concert tomorrow , and I have partially lost my voice .... it's like they know ... it's like they know I need it and they take it away ... * shakes fist in the air * 
Um yeah ! Avenged Sevenfold and Disturbed concert right now !!!!!!! WHOOOOOOOOOO ! 
I had one of the most amazing experiences in my life last night . Sinister Gates in person .. M Shadows in person ... the whole gang ( sans the Rev . R . I . P . ) . All the live albums in the world couldn't re-create that feeling . Speaking of which ; it's really hard to write this feeling down . ^_^ \ 
p.s. throat needs warm water and < PROPFEMALE > with lemon ... how do the Stars DO it without needing serious throat therapy afterward ? :) 
Got my ring today . It is beautiful . Wish I could take a pic of it that would actually come out good . > < 
Why do I have to look like such a 12 year old ????? > < 
Voice your prophecy shed us some light . Feel sorrow for mankind's < PROPMALE > to survive . Swallowed lies and swam in your own tears ; a stab in the dark and it wounded our will . We won't be here tomorrow . Hold on to me for one last time . 
\A soft answer turneth away wrath ; but grievous words stir up anger . The tongue of the wise uses knowledge aright : but the mouth of the fools pours out foolishness . \ " \ 
How did we meet ? ( Post this to your status to see who remembers ..... ) 
Kicked but in softball last night .... it was friggin awesome ! Go team ! 
Time to sleeeeeeeeeeeeep .. oh my aching feet ... 
It's a dangerous business , Frodo , going out of your front door . You step out into the road , and if you don't keep your feet , there is no knowing where you might be swept off to . ~ Bilbo Baggins 
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm ... soup for breakfast ! 
So ... had a sucky day at work for a reason that I can't even believe happened .... UPSIDE though .... wicked softball game last night , and even though the opposing team were poor sports , I don't mind that we lost . We sure gave ' em what for ! 
I Like It On the Swivel-Back Chair :) 
Ok ... so i know what movie I'm buying next-BEAUTY AND THE BEAST ! \ 
What the heck is wrong with me ? Why dont I have it already ? o.O 
OWL CITY makes me dance a happy dance .. in my chair ... bundled in a blankey ... playing a game ;) 
Comfort food = bowl of black olives and Cranberry Juice ^_^ \ 
Don't judge me 
Softball game at 715 :) YAY !!! ( please , rain , stay away ! ) 
Greater love hath no man than this , that a man lay down his life for his friends . \ 
~ John 15:13 
Ahhh .. instant coffee in a thermos- a nice treat after a caffeine break . Doctor appointment today * bleh * buuuuuut .... SOFTBALL at 815 !!! YAY !! 
If at first you don't succeed , try , try again . If that doesn't work ... * shrug * 
Woke up to a beautiful , crispy morning . It's FREEZING ! YAY !!!! 
In a way , i'm kind of glad I don't have two days off in a row . It just seems easier when you aren't away for too long . lol 
My man is a genius !!! ^_^ 
Migraine , Migraine , go away . Come again some other time ; in another life , when we are both cats . 
Dinner !!!!! 
Her love outshines her darkest shadow and covers all her fears , and all you see is the brilliant smile that masks her many tears . 
I'm not the good person I thought I was . I should be put down . Luckily for me , I don't get taken to the shelter when no one wants me . I just get to live with the shit and let it consume me from the inside . 
15 days till my b-day hooray ! 
Sorrow sank deep inside my blood- All the ones around me I cared for and most of all i loved , But I can't see myself that way . Please don't forget me , or cry while I'm away . 
Got my Rogue on . First pu t-t ogether Halloween costume = success ! 
Time to write it up . Nanowrimo , here I come ! 
Wow ... tears .. where the Hell do you come from !? 
So super duper pissed ... 
Oh , My Great Toastey Tootsies . What a friggin day ... 
Making apopointments with doctors on my birthday , is not really how I planned to spend my time . 
Writing a novel while bundled up in a blanket with the heat turned on and medication coursing through my bloodstream . Ahhhhhh ... cozy ! 
Shake , shake ! Shake shake- A shake it ! 
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAY !!!! Post-Birthday snow !!! <3 <3 
Could this be the end ? Is this the way I die ? Sitting here alone , no one by my side . I don't understand . I don't feel that I deserve this . What did I do wrong ? I just don't understand . 
I'm forever blowing bubbles ! Pretty bubbles in the air . They fly so high ! They reach the sky ; then like my dreams , they fade and die ... 
A small run after watching a very inspiring and empowering movie . Feels soooo good right now <3 
Having a really blah day for some reason ... nothing feels quite like it should . I suppose one never knows what anything is really supposed to feel like .. 
Put this under your skin- ' Cause I am me , and I won't change for anyone . 
I hope it's worth it , out on the highway , yeah\ 
I know you'll find your own way when I'm not with you . \ 
\ 
So tell everybody , the ones who walk beside me , yeah\ 
I hope you'll find your own way when I'm not with you tonight 
The joke behind the smile ; the faith behind the fear- The queerest of the queer . 
Change is coming through my shadow . \ 
My shadow's shedding skin . \ 
I've been picking \ 
my scabs again . \ 
I've been crawling on my belly , \ 
clearing out what could've been . \ 
I've been wallowing in my own chaotic \ 
and insecure delusions . \ 
I wanna feel the change consume me- \ 
Feel the outside turning in . \ 
I wanna feel the metamorphosis and \ 
cleansing I've endured within . 
Wear the grudge like a crown of negativity . Calculate what we will or will not tolerate . Desperate to control all and everything . Unable to forgive your < PROPFEMALE > lettermen 
Finger deep within the borderline . \ 
Show me that you love me and that we belong together . \ 
Relax , turn around and take my hand . 
Dim my eyes , if they should \ 
compromise our fulcrum ; \ 
Want and need - if I need it \ 
I might as well be gone . \ 
Shine on forever . \ 
Shine on benevolent son . 
I am just a worthless liar . I am just an imbecile . I will only complicate you . Trust in me and fall as well . I will find a center in you . I will chew it up and leave . I will work to elevate you just enough to bring you down . 
Cold silence has a tendency to atrophy any\ 
sense of compassion\ 
between supposed lovers/brothers . 
Have not the strongest and closest ties been bound so long ? I've called upon them ; they remind me where I'm from . With deep conviction , I'm connected across the < PROPMALE > - without them , nothing worth relying on . \ 
It's been so long since I could say I needed anything stronger . We can't give up when we have ties that bind , if I rely and know the strength in those who taught me of the power of the ties that bind . 
I swear .. Little kids are worse than a fucking hurricane ... * beats fists against pillow * 
The Devil and his had me down . In love with the dark side I found , dabbling all the way down . Up to my neck ; soon to drown . 
Five more days to pack up all my shinannigans ... but I'm sick and don't feel like it ... AND I still need to get to the post office . > < oooooo ! frustration ! 
Ah .. guilt trips . So don't need this right now ... and they wonder why I don't want to talk to them . Silly people * shakes head * 
HAPPY CHRISTMAS TO EVERYONE !!! 
A Big THANK YOU !!!! To < PROPFEMALE > and her family . You guys were a blessing today . <3 
< PROPFEMALE > scratched me ... I forgot how much those things hurt > < 
Peace is a lie . There is only passion . 
Goodbye Longmont ! * wave * 
All that is gold does not glitter . Not all those who wander are lost . The old that is strong does not wither . Deep roots are not reached by the frost . 
Has pneumonia 
I'm pretty sure you would die if an elephant sat on your chest , so why do people use that expression to convey that they are having a hard time breathing ? Why not say you have a 50 pound sand bag on your chest ? That sounds reasonable ... doesn't it ? 
If nothing's fair in love and war , then why do so many people seek them ? 
Went shooting today . EPIC ! Fave was the high powered rifle * Fist pump * 
Hates little hand cuts and not knowing where they came from !! 
Want for nothing or want for everything . There is no middle ground . Want for something or want for nothing . For division your soul is bound . 
Home made Long island iced teas . Fuck yeah ... 
No secrets , deception for these would tear this down . I'll note the past ; spare the pain . Words match my deeds with brutal honesty . Never forget these choices were made by me . And I hear this calling ; still you don't seem so far at all . And I hear this calling out ... 
Fell on a truck heater and cut myself real nice ... watching a movie is going to be really uncomfortable for a while ... lol 
Watching Hook . OMG I love this movie !!!!! <3 
I'm gonna sing the Doom Song now ... 
GUINNESS !!!! 
Bed for 5 days . I'm gonna shoot something . 
Easy for a good girl to go bad , and once we've gone , believe we've gone forever . Don't be the reason . You better learn how to treat us right . ' Cause once a good girl goes bad , we die forever . 
But , with the blast-shield down , I can't see a thing . How am I supposed to fight ? \ 
Your eyes can deceive you ; don't trust them . 
Liar , Lawyer , mirror show me what's the difference ? Kangaroo done < PROPMALE > the guilty with the innocent . Now you're weeping shades of cozen indigo . Got lemon juice up in your eye when you pissed all over my black kettle . You musy have been ... high . 
Five cups of coffee . Can you say ' Wired' ? 
OMG !! Land Before Time \If We Hold on Together\ " MEMORIES !!!! " 
Scetti and meatballs . ^_^ yum yum in the tum 
Shhhh ... quiet . You might piss somebody off . 
Fruit-good ; cake-great ; fruitcake-nasty crap 
Fuck these disfunctional , insecure actresses . 
Some say the end is near . Some say we'll see Armageddon soon . I certainly hope we will . I sure could use a vacation from this bullshit , three-ring , circus , sideshow of freaks ! 
Just got done watching Bicentennial Man . I can't believe I never saw that movie before . Very nicely done . * tear * 
* Deep breath * Here I go ... * closes eyes and jumps * Wheeeeeeee ! :) \ 
p.s. I really , reeeeaaally hope I finish this time 
* Sigh * I had forgotten just how touching The Land Before Time really was . * sniff * 
Ok . I am definitely on a movie kick . Fly Away Home = another movie to make me cry . * happy sigh * 
Ok , streamed X-Men numero uno ... now I'm mad ' cause I can't stream the rest of them . > < * steam pours out of ears * 
Question ... When a person calls from a blocked ID and you answer and establish that they have the wrong number , what the hell are you supposed to think when they keep calling back every 3.5 minutes ? MY NAME'S NOT < PROPFEMALE > !!! 
5 cups of coffee later , I realize I talk too much . 
Somebody stop me !! I'm bleaching the walls 
Pardon me , sir , can I use your eraser to remove my brain of unconventional nature ? 
Jealousy is an ugly word , but you don't seem to care . Converse behind my back , but now I'm here . Need no one to comply with me though everyone that I defeat ; dont need you . Fuck comaraderie . This rage will never go away . 
Mmmmm ... A nice , hot cup of tea and a robe keep me cozy in this 5 degree weather . <3 
-21 .. Good Lord 
Just got done watching The Esoteric Agenda . I am not quite sure I'm happy I did that . lol 
Had my first Starbucks coffee since leaving Longmont . Amazing . :) 
Fever broke , and it's 19 degrees outside . Yay ! I can go out in the cold air and smell the snow . 
I don't get the friggin temperature here . yesterday , it barely got to 15 degrees , now it's 30 degrees . what gives ??? o.O 
A clouded dream on an earthly night hangs upon the crescent < PROPFEMALE > . A voiceless song in an ageless light sings at the coming < PROPFEMALE > . Birds in flight are calling there-where the heart moves the stones . It's there that my heart is longing all for the love of you . 
What do you do when you want sleep , but sleep doesn't want you ? 
And shepherds we shall be for Thee , my Lord , for Thee . Power hath descended forth from Thy hand . Our feet may swiftly < PROPFEMALE > out Thy command . So we shall flow a river forth to Thee , and teeming with souls shall it ever be . \ 
In Nomeni Patri Et Fili Spiritus Sancti 
Soooooooo .... shit ... -22 ... so much for trying to go outside . 
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars ? I could really use a wish right now . 
Can't keep this bitch down . She be dancin ' . <3 
* Pulls hair out * Just swept the GD floor yesterday , and what do I do ? Put on the same bloody shoes that tracked the dirt in in the first place and walked over the effing clean floor with them . ARGH ! 
You say you don't want it again and again , but you don't-you don't really mean it . You say you don't want i t-t his circus we're in-but you don't , you don't really mean it . You don't-don't really mean it . 
And I'm so sad . Like a good book , I can't put this day back . A sorta < PROPFEMALE > tale with you ; a sorta < PROPFEMALE > tale with you . 
Women just have to look at ice cream and they get fatter . 
Eggs and Bakey for brekky lol 
Why am I up at 3 AM ? Ya got me . But isn't it great ?! 
* singsong * Tuuuunaaaaa Sammich for Brekkyfaaast 
Carrots for lunch ? Suuuuuure ... 
It's wicked windy ... time to strap bricks to my legs . 
If only I could have wept in mourning by her side ; I would have clasped her so tight . Like storm-beached Aphrodite , drowned on Kytherean tides . 
Listening to Journey . * sigh * Memories ^_^ 
Talking to her little sister . My day just became unbelievably amazing . \ 
Hooooot Pockeeeettttt 
Huuuuungry ... shhhh .. go back to sleep and it'll go away .... 
Right ... gonna go dye my hair . If I don't return ... check the drain 
5 cups of coffee and a load of dishes ... * rolls up sleeves * pokers beware 
R.I.P. Coach Holycross . I'll miss you . 
Ok , so when I am upset and need quiet , don't come to me about your fucking problems at work . I'm not interested on how much money the company is going to lose , or how so and so is screwing another so and so out of whatever . Leave me the fuck alone . 
Singing and twirling in circles gets in the way of dishes I have discovered . * what to do .. what to do * ... 
Fool me once ; shame on you . Fool me twice ; shame on me . Fool me thrice , and it seems to be , that I'm the nicest girl you'll ever see . 
Just got done watching < PROPFEMALE > . Such a nice movie ... old and nice :) 
Cold showers suck . 
If you want to talk to me , don't wait till you are drunk to call me and rant . Be an effing adult and do it while < PROPFEMALE > sober . I thought adults were supposed to act .. you know ... adult . 
Bubble wrap ... I love you 
Yay hour and a half of sleep . 
Pineapple 
Fool me once , shame on you ; fool me twice , shame on me ; fool me thrice , and it seems to me , I'm the dumbest woman you'll ever see . 
Once bitten , twice shy 
Nothin ' like a loooooong walk on a warm , breezy day to lift the spirit . <3 
Just finished watching the Nutcracker ... * sigh * memories . Now to make TACOS !!! 
It just doesn't add up . Fruit-good ; cake-great ; fruitcake- nasty crap 
When I was young , I used to believe that there were Leprechauns with pots of gold at the end of rainbows . 
90% out of 100% is never enough 
To my three younger sisters : we create an unstoppable force- one that is unceasing and never changing come hell or high water . We are who we are , and we are proud . 
Worked out only to find that when I got home the water was turned off ... well , this sucks . 
Water ... how I've missed you <3 
The girl you just called fat ? She's been starving herself and has lost 30lbs . That boy you called stupid ? He has a learning disability and studies over four hours a night . That girl you just called ugly ? She spends hours putting on make up hoping someone will like her . The boy you just tripped ? He's abused enough at home . There's more to people than you may think .. Re-post if your against bullying . ? ? 
LOL I don't need green clothes . I have green permanently on my skin ! Boo Ya ! 
< PROPFEMALE > car bombs wait for meeeeee 
If you have a sister who has made you laugh , punched you , stuck up for you , drove you crazy , hugged you , watched you succeed , saw you fail , picked you back up , cheered you on , made you strong , and is someone you can't live without & someone you can always count on ... repost this if you have a sister you love ** WJL & SML **** 
Attempting to quit smoking without the patch . This is gonna be fun 
Dear Tofu , you are strange , but you make my salad yummy , so I forgive you . <3 
Feels a sore throat coming on ... time for tea and < PROPFEMALE > 
Well , my voice is gone , and I'm missing it badly . After all , what's a chatterbox without her voice ? 
Hot water and < PROPFEMALE > is a very temporary relief , but boy does it feel good . 
Is massively ill ... goodbye world . See you in a few days . * snooze * 
Chicken broth and < PROPFEMALE > Eyre = a sick girl's Heaven 
When you are sick , dreams can be the rabbit hole to your own personal Wonderland . 
The wind outside reminds me of the Whinnie-the-Pooh movie on \A Blustery Day\ " . Dear Lord ... memories . Oh dear . Oh de-de-dear dear " 
So , had a dream that the family was back together , playing tennis , and sticking together like we used to more than 7 years ago . I woke up crying . What the hell ? 
Haven't eaten anything all day . Thank you , sickness 
Wrote my baby sister a song for her birthday .. hope she likey ^_^ <3 happy birthday < PROPFEMALE > !!! 
Dear Mister or Missus cough , please leave poor < PROPFEMALE > alone so she can get rest to combat < PROPFEMALE > partner in crime Mister Virus . Thank you 
* Brandishes large plastic spoon at the Demon Lord * I don't care how powerful you are , I know some moves that will scare even you . 
Think too much and you will cry ; try to bottle it up inside ; shove the tears back where they came ; then give up because there's too much pain . 
Thoroughly exhausted 
Soybean salad with cucumber , olives , tofu , and balsamic vinegar . Can't get better than that <3 
Is making Tacos . Mmmm ... 
Fluuuush Pockeeeet ! 
T minus 19 days 
Handwritten letters hurt ... ~ 
They make you cringe , they make you squirm ; the thoughts inside you-like a worm . It makes its way to the darkest regions of your mind and soul ; there is no reason . Conjuring up your deepest fear . You feel like a child , and it holds you dear . It feeds on every thought and whim . Through murky waters you must swim . Images and phantasms pass by , making you shudder , making you cry . 
Lift off in less than a week 
Must be feeling better . I don't have the longing to sleep for hours on end . 
Cats ... why is it always cats ? 
T-minus one week till \bye bye Colorado \"" 
In < PROPFEMALE > for the next few days . Then ... on the road again ! 
It's sad how we change the context of what we are writing based on the words that we can spell . \I'll see you tomo-tommo-tomah-next week . \""
