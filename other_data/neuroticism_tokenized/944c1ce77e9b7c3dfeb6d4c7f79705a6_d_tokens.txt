just got engaged last saturday ( 6/20 ) :) 

I found out that Im gonna have a baby .. due date is April 1 , 2010 ! 
New pictures of < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > !!! 
I love waking up to someone talking my ear off and they can't even say a word <3 
Lowe's = SUCK ! // Me = Exhausted :( 
Sleeping , playing with my baby when he wakes me up :) then work 2-10 :( 
Working 4-11 , then finally four days off !!! 
Taking < PROPMALE > to meet his cousin , then going to see Dinner For Schmucks with my love ! <3 
Dinner For Schmucks was perhaps the most hilarious movie I have seen in a very long time :) I <3 < PROPMALE > Carell 
Work 4-10 .. again . I </3 Lowes . 
Sleeping , playing with < PROPMALE > when I wake up , getting ready for work , taking < PROPMALE > to see his grandma for her birthday , then work 6-10 . 
Exhausted from work . < PROPMALE>'s exhausted from partying at grandma's . I get to work at 7am and he gets to ... well , be a baby and sleep whenever he wants . I'm so jealous ... 
Trying not to procrastinate . Eating some corn flakes and then working on homework for a couple hours before bed ! Hopefully I'm not woken up a million times tonight >.< 
Taking care of a baby + working on homework = nothing getting done for school\ 
\ 
This is going to be a very long semester o.O 
Ahh why do babies like to wake up at 7:00 am ??? 
Suddenly exhausted . Sleeping until < PROPMALE > decides to wake me up with his silly talk that I cannot understand <3 
Shower , picking my love up from work , grocery store , and then getting my hair cut !! <3<3 
School >.< 
Working on homework at 10:00 on a Saturday night . And what would I rather be doing ?.... SLEEPING ! What happened to doing fun stuff ? lol 
OMG transferring pictures from my old phone SUCKS ! 
Wow if anything else could fucking go wrong .... 
Ahh peace and quiet .. I guess making the baby think that the vacuum will eat him unless he calms down and takes a nap really works ... 
Super bored . < PROPMALE > is sleeping . No one to play with . * Sigh * 
* sigh * when will the homework end ??? 
Fuck homework ! I am going to sleep .. will just have to teach < PROPMALE > about computer systems and business management tomorrow .. 
Getting ready , work 4-10 </3 Can't I just stay home and sleep ?? 
Turned in my homework with 1 minute to spare .. Sleeping . Probably getting up around 7 cause Trentasaurus likes to get up early , and then I'm gonna start packing :) 
Construction zones on rt 2 suck >.< 
PACKING ! CAUSE I'M MOVING ! YAY ! 
Anyone know of any cat groomers that will cut a long hair cat for less than $50 ???

Getting ready , work 4-10 , home to sleep , then working again 7-2 ! </3
