Just got done with < PROPFEMALE>'s dentist appt . and the verdict is ... she needs a partial set of braces now and a full set later . Nothing is covered by insurance so looks like $1880 ! Guess we'll be living off beans and rice for a while ! 
One stripe test and one fat lip later ... heading home to put the kids to bed !! 
Nothing pisses me off more then when the car in front of me is accelerating with their brake lights on !!

It is so cute that the kids are trying to guess what their presents under the tree are , but not so cute when < PROPFEMALE > can guess one even in it's box !!! How does she know she's getting a mini guitar ?? Hmmmm ??? 
I'm done ! A regular ' No ' would have worked for me but again that is too easy for us . I get it ! I understand you're mad but I was not accusing you of anything ! But after everything we have been through , I think I have a right to ask .

Anyone looking at getting a tattoo soon ? 
Driving to find rain ! Thanks < PROPFEMALE > ! I'm not looking forward to a tornado !

I feel much better today , finally , it feels like it's been a while . 
I put my phone in my purse an hour ago without the key guard on , when I pulled it out it said ' Hi ' on the screen . is that weird to anyone else or just me ? 
Powers out !! Good thing the kids finally fell asleep ! 
Good news !! We woke up with power this morning and no damage to the house or yard ! Even after expected winds of up to 50 mph and a 3 ft branch smacking the side of the house at 2am ? Man , we're lucky ! 
How is it that I have a very independent child and a very dependent one ? Dependent one can occupy himself in his room for hours and the independent one needs me the occupy her or she's bored ? 
A memorial fund has been opened for my uncle , < PROPMALE > Coble , at Fibre Federal Credit Union . If you would like to donate there are two locations in Longview , Wa and one in Woodland , Wa .

TO NON-PET OWNERS who visit our homes and complain about our pets . 1 ) They live here , you don't . 2 ) If you don't want their hair on your clothes , stay off the furniture . That's why they call it ' Fur'-niture . 3 ) Chances are , I love my pets more than I like you . 4 ) To you , they are animals . ... To me , they are my babies and family ... who are hairy , walk on all fours & don't talk back ! Re-post if you love your pet 
Managed to stay up ALL day ! First time this week ! High Voltage mocha from AMPM worked !! Now if I can just sleep tonight ... 
I've carried children within my body . Slept with babies on my chest . I've kissed boo boos and mended broken hearts . I've been puked on , peed on , and spent sleepless nights in the rocking chair . But I wouldn't have it any other way . My body isn't magazine perfect , but when I look in the mirror I see a MOM , and there is no greater honor or blessing !! Post this as your status if you are proud to be a Mom ?

< PROPFIRST > looks at the TV and blinks constantly , but only when he looks at the TV . Has anyone heard of this before ?

Worst weekend of my life !!! After everything that went wrong yesterday , how am I gonna explain to my husband that I got a speeding ticket today ?!? 
Well , I told him and we're still married ! :-) I guess it helps to put him on speaker phone to tell him with the kids around ! 
Oh lazy day .... How I love thee ....... 
Changed bedtime to 7pm instead of 8pm tonight !! < PROPFIRST > says \You are the best mom ever !! I've always wanted to sleep at 7 because I am already tired !! Goodnight ! \ " HAHA "
