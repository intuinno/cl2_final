Is feeling a little DUB in his STEP !!! 
We're the middle children of history , man . No purpose or place . We have no Great War . No Great Depression . Our Great War's a spiritual war ... our Great Depression is our lives . We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires , and movie gods , and rock stars . But we won't . And we're slowly learning that fact . And we're very , very pissed off . 
Angels on the sideline , Baffled and confused . Father blessed them all with reason . And this is what they choose . 
All matter is merely energy condensed down to a slow vibration . That we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively . There is no such thing as death , life is only a dream , and we are the imagination of ourselves . 
Going to see < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST>'s Band Wednesday !!!!! IM SO STOAKED =D

If I'm alone I cannot hate\
