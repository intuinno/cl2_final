is only focused on two things at the time : school and getting closer to God . Friends&Guys ; irrelevant and come&go ... 
is thinking we sit here and complain about everything BUT the things that really matter . Life is too short to stress out over nonsense and give it too much attention . Live everyday as if it's your last ( not meaning to party ) , but as if you're preparing for your final destination ; heaven . 
wishes the past would stop tapping me on my shoulder because i have no intentions of turning around to greet or mingle with it . SN : church was just lovely <3

There's always a little truth behind every \just kidding\ " . A little knowledge behind every \ " I don't know\ " . A little emotion behind every \ " I don't care\ " and a little pain behind every \ " it's okay \"" 
First day of my last year at < PROPMALE > , then off to study speech pathology at usm , sweet ! 
intends on changing this schedule tomorrow , i hope everything goes as planned . SN : not having kids until i'm 304 , don't have the < PROPFEMALE > ....

Amen . <3 
he probably robbed the bank to buy a car , lol 
When you're down to nothing , God is up to something .... 
at this very moment some annoying guy is trying to talk to me , and it's hilarious * giggles * and he keeps referring to me as baby after i told him tj ... twice !

second < PROPMALE > ? na , hon .... i don't believe in second < PROPMALE > s . you screw up once , most likely you'll do it again and it's obvious you're not that smart because smart people don't fail , even in relationships :) 
I like it on the floor and in the car .... 
I hate when ppl stand over/behind me and expect me to move out of their way without them saying \excuse me\ " . I just sit there and look as clueless as they do ... "

has not been in the christmas spirit at all this month . I guess the older i get the less exciting it is ...

If someone you love hurts you cry a river , build a bridge , and get over it . 
Has an 8 o'clock and has to get up at 6 , but unfortunately i cannot sleep ! 
< PROPFEMALE > is not a virtue , it's a waste of time 
Love is like quicksand , the deeper you fall in the harder it is to get out ... 
Never realized how many obese or \chunky\ " children there were until i went in wal mart today ... like seriously " 
Never regret anything because at one time it was exactly what you wanted ... 
There is no such thing as acting white or black but there is a such thing as being/acting educated or ignorant .... i'm just saying 
God , if I cant have what I want , let me want what I have . 
if you love someone put their name in a circle instead of a heart because hearts break and circles go on forever ..... 
To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance . 
< PROPMALE > needs to get some heat ! 
Never be sad for what is over , just be glad that it was once yours . 
Things could always be better , then again they could be much worse . SN : not lucky but blessed ... 
Is wishing my baby sister , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Henderson a happy 16th birthday !!!!! I always liked you a little more than the middle child , Sharonica Henderson lol j/k ! SN : little boys you better stay away from her until she's 30 
can't believe what i just found out .... really hurt ! SN : this will be last time i put my all into another one .... 
But i say unto you , love your enemies , bless them that curse you , do good to them that hate you , and pray for them which despitefully use , and persecute you ... -Mathew 5:44 
It is better to stay silent and be thought a fool , than to open ones mouth and remove all doubt . 
Just wants the people who blast their music loud enough for everyone to hear to know that one day .... you WILL wear hearing aids and probably before age 30 
As we grow up , we don't lose friends ..... we just find out who the real ones are ...

I officially hate cold weather . Winter is no longer my favorite season ! I can't feel my hands :(

So overwhelmed ..... the Lord just keeps on blessing me when i know i don't deserve any of it .... 
Everything ain't for everybody ha 
Misery loves company but i ain't trying to make new friends .... 
Sometimes , you just have to smile , pretend everything's okay , hold back the tears and walk away . If you want to see the rainbow you must go through the rain . If you want TRUE LOVE you must go through the pain . Women were made from a man's rib , not from his head to be superior , not from his feet to be walked on , but from his side to be equal , from under the arm to be protected , and from next to the heart to be loved . 
Can't wait for the day when i have my own stuff and the only person i'll have to call on for help is God and no other . 
I tell you the truth ! You give someone an inch and they take a mile ... and keep traveling ! About to let go of some extra \baggage \"" 
Looks like i'll be graduating from Co-Lin after all woohoo !!! Thank God ! 
Don't go looking for something that's gonna hurt your feelings , especially if you can't handle the truth 
Well ... got all A's for midterm , but that ain't nothing new . 
Finally home from work and i'm so tired . Working at wal mart reminds me why i'm going to school-so i can sit in a rolling chair instead of walking all day .

You are only young once , but you can stay immature indefinitely . 
If you feel your circulation being cut off or see a lot of loose skin and the exposed areas jiggle but feels restrained at the same time , then maybe you shouldn't have put it on 
Every time i get up to get dressed i find myself back in bed sometimes with a new article of clothing on smh SN : lazy

Sad when your own family hate to see you doing good but i'm only gonna get better because success is all i've ever known , so they can either be apart of my success or they can just stand on the sidelines and watch ...

Taking an innocent or guilty person's life NEVER solves anything . Revenge isn't the answer . No one walking this earth is God nor is anyone as powerful as him , so what gives us the right to take any man's life ? Absolutely Nothing . Murder is murder , therefore it's a sin . R.I.P. < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > 
Never give someone the satisfaction of knowing they've upset or offended you , then they automatically have power over you and win ! 
Slightly pissed but not gonna let it mess up my night , which is going pretty smooth

oh how i dread my speech and hearing a&p test i have at 12 . Pray for me ... 
Made a B on my a&p test and i'm satisfied . It was four points from an A though :( 
I want some chinese , backyard burger , some bacon , and strawberry cake with a strawberry lemonade ..... starving is an understatement 
Remember when a guy sweeps you off your feet he is in the perfect position to drop you on your butt ! 
I loves me some cool/cold weather ! 
Usually I have an answer for everything , school related ha , but I suck at this life crap so I don't care anymore wtbs : such a beautiful day guess I'll take advantage of it , when I get off ! 
Work , study , eat , sleep ; the life of a college student 
Having a pretty good day , hoping no one or anything messes it up 
Relationships are so overrated 
Never lead a girl on , make it clear from the beginning where you're trying to go with her , keeps confusion down and saves her from hurt feelings .... just saying 
When you got something good hold on to it , because someone else is waiting for you to slip up and take your spot 
If i don't get some strawberry cake from somewhere soon , i'm gonna act a fool !!! Anybody wanna make me one ? 
Lord knows I dread to wash this hair of mines , but I gotta do it 
Be careful what you take for granted , someone else is waiting to appreciate it ..... 
Freaking hate c-spire wireless !!!!! About to switch over 
Doing a little retail therapy ahh .... no longer upset :) 
My car needs to be washed Sunday , any takers ? 
Ugh .... might be leaving back for hattiesburg tomorrow the way people getting on my nerves . Ain't been here two days yet 
My favorite thing to put on everyday is confidence and a smile , kills em every time ! 
Still haven't ran across anyone worthy of me but the ones I know are convenient and entertaining #men .... OAN : had so much fun at the fair with the fam but about to take my tired behind to sleep 
I don't know about these other females but I don't wanna be somebody's baby mama , wifey , main chick , side chick .... I better be the ONLY chick .... and I'd rather be \the wife\ " or \ " Mrs. \"" 
Never take relationship advice from single friends .... just keep them out of your business altogether 
About to go to this clubhouse and pop it 4 pimp ( workout ) lol 
Yaay !!! Cold weather means hair like feathers ! Back to the roller wrap I go ! 
Beautiful , smart , and confident ... hard to come by ... catch me while you can ... just saying 
it's raining men ? well i think i'm experiencing a drought ... 
Mind and heart in the same place ... but trying to separate them ... 
USM homecoming today . SMTTT !!!!!! #proudstudent 
Not happy where I'm at , but its where I wanna be .... 
Holding on until I find something better 
I don't really wanna stay , I don't really wanna go , but I really need to know ... can we get it together ?.... 
Me and jas still up like its the weekend or something but we don't have class until 11 ... if you're up hmu 
Yea , I'm stressed out thanks to school so I'm just gonna pray and try my best 
I'm so tired of school , I'm just ready to get it over with and start working 
i would just like to take the time out to wish the most important man in my life ( next to God ) a HAPPY BIRTHDAY ..... to my daddy , < PROPMALE > Henderson !!!! Love you ! 
I'm getting my hair done tomorrow and I'm so happy lalalalalaaaa !!!!! And now I'm singing :) 
Funny how I always try to help ppl but they can never do anything for me , not even the simplest things , so I'm about to stop , about to be one selfish female 
Guess I'll study and work on my paper this weekend .... the joy of school 
So used to getting what I want , I don't know how to react when I'm told no #pissed 
Woke up feeling great ! Thank God ! and i'm giving nobody the power to mess up my day :) 
Being a little less of tejerria and a little more of Tj ... and I love it 
It'd be a blessing if someone cooked Sunday dinner and invited me over , so I won't have to leave home on an empty stomach 
Haunted house tonight with friends ! But studying first ... 
Scared money don't make no money , if I ever go broke i'ma take yo ' money .. i'ma boss ! lol 
Wanna say a very special Happy Birthday to my best burg friend , < PROPFEMALE > Topp !!!! You're 21 !!!! Can't wait for the celebration Saturday ! 
In a really good mood :) 
People who get in relationships and act like they're married are setting themselves up for failure 
two days really happy , back to back ! thanks to one particular person , bet he sees this too :) 
just found $5 in my pocket , day starting off good already ! 
No one has relationships anymore , just relations 
I hate for this weekend to end , had so much fun ! 
Did my absentee vote Friday and voted \no\ " on Initiative 26 . If you're smart you'll do the same tomorrow ! " 
Got my hot wings !!!! 
Seriously thinking about going to grad school at ole miss or jsu , but crossing fingers for ole miss 
Treating ppl how they treat me . If you don't give a * u*k , I don't give a flying , ducking , swimming , tossing nor swerving * u*k
