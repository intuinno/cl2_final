Socialism is the almighty scourge on the American Way ! I recommend we abolish these few abhorrent , blatently communist programs in the next few years : Free K-12 education , the military , police , the FDA ( You know , those nice people that keep you from eating Asbest-O's in the morning ) , fire departments , public libraries ( Almost there already ! Down with the librarians and their liberal \knowledge is power\ " agenda ! ) "

Why does self-confidence and the ability to shrug off shyness only come to me when the sun is down and all the uses I have for it are closed , in bed , or otherwise unavailable ?

Not tired , and yet exhausted . \ 
I don't even know what to do about this . 
Got the weight of my own world around my shoulders , two opposite places to put it , and not a lot of time to pick . 
I just realized that I almost never look back with regret , but when I look forward I feel it acutely it for every possible action before me .

They're like nails on a damn chalkboard to me . 
Mmm . Pandora station that plays music like the soundtrack to Gladiator . Awesomesauce . 
You all are a great disappointment . \ 
I was hoping for tasty , tasty duck tears ripe for the trolling , and here you all are NOT being poor-sports . You guys take all the fun out of being a jerk .

Really loud NIN at 1:30 AM is okay with me . \ 
( Dear neighbors , if it is not okay with you please sell that crap-sounding Dodge truck you start up at all hours of the night , lest you be a hypocrite .... Also either let your dogs inside , or give them to someone who will care for them ... ) 
Sleep is for the weak . Consciousness to the point of delirium is where it's at . 
So much fucking adrenaline . 
5:30 AM . Will I finally get some sleep ? Probably not ... 
I hope this sticks with me , at least until I fall asleep . 
Fuck everything . 
I need something to do . Something fun . Something distracting . 
I'll probably wish I hadn't done that ... 
I want to go back to sleep ... For a week . 
Real eyes realize real lies . \ 
Graffiti for some reason has the cleverest of sayings ... 
Wish it was 6:00 . \ 
I need a distraction . 
That was the worst dream . Ever . Of all time . \ 
Fell asleep to escape , and witnessed a reality that was so much worse . 
Another night , another nightmare . 
Hmm ... Pandora just brought up a Nirvana song and won't let me skip it . I'm gonna take this as a sign it's time to go to bed .

Clearly I do not play frequently enough . 
? I've been crawling on my belly\ 
Clearing out what could've been . \ 
I've been wallowing in my own chaotic\

I wanna feel the change consume me , \ 
Feel the outside turning in . \ 
I wanna feel the metamorphosis and\ 
Cleansing I've endured within ?
