is really in the mood to sit down and watch movies this weekend ..... just ordered Charade from the library . Any other suggestions ? 
listening to Vivaldi while reading about Stravinsky's Rite of Spring creates quite a pleasurable oxymoron ! 
“A real tradition is not the relic of a past irretrievably gone ; it is a living force that animates and informs the present Far from implying the repetition of what has been , tradition presupposed the reality of what endures Tradition ensures the continuity of creation A renewal is fruitful only when it goes hand in hand with tradition . ” ~ Igor Stravinsky 
isn't sure whether to be satisfied or not with the True Blood season finale ... 
just watched Charade after a VERY long day , and it was so good that it actually turned my day from \long and arduous\ " to great ! "

the 3rd movement of Mahler's second symphony makes me understand what it's like to be schizophrenic .

is sick , but still managed to get some work done .... Now to reward myself by watching Shakespeare's \Twelfth Night\ " :) " 
thinks expectorants are great , but wouldn't it be much more efficient for engineer's to create a vacuum that can just clear out your lungs ? 
Just wrote 9 pages of his thesis in 3 hours .... now to just let the smoke from the keyboard clear before I continue !
