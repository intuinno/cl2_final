saw Where the Wild Things Are [ Really Good ] , the story and psychology were interesting and very well done ; it was interesting that they didn't resolve anything in the end of the movie too ; the visuals were also done very well , they only used CG when they could not have done it practically or well enough using physical effects , and the integration was seemless and looked great . 
just saw Kick-Ass [ Good ] 
is disappointed in the robotics industry’s increasing role in the defense industry . There are already too many ways to kill people . Robots are supposed to help and entertain people , not help A people impose their beliefs on another people . An Engineer's first duty is to public safety and the improvement of the human condition , so I am saddened that there are any engineers in the defense industry at all

I do not believe in the SuperNatural , I only believe in the limit to my own experience and understanding of the Natural world and that ' impossible ' is merely a statistical improbability .
