I could really use a smoothie from Robeks right about now . 
I hate waiting to figure out if I got the job I want

Stress overload . This is not going to be a good night . 
Cant wait for Saturday , Ill finally be tan again ! March 25th needs to hurry up and get here too ! 
It either needs to warm up like super fast over night , or my supervisor needs to call me and say I don't need to go to work tomorrow . I would rather not freeze all day . 
Today was torture at work . It was freezing cold , and some how I still got burnt . Oh well at least I will be tan :) 13 more days ! 
Sooo happy ! I got a 84 on a math test I thought I failed . :) \ 
8 more days till vacation <3 
Only I can slice my finger with a box cutter , then slice the same cut even more unloading the dishwasher . I think I need to start wearing like a full body suit that way I cant get hurt . 
Horrible week . Hopefully tonight will be better . 
I need some shifts covered this weekend at < PROPFEMALE > . Friday 9:30 -6 and Saturday 10:30 -4 .
