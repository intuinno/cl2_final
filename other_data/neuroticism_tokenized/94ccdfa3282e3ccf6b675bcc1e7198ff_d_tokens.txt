Please put this on your status if you know or love someone who is gay . My wish for 2010 is that people will understand that being gay is neither a disease nor a choice - people who are gay are not looking for a cure but ACCEPTANCE and EQUAL RIGHTS . Will you make it your status for at least one hour ? ? Promote LOVE & Acceptance , not hate

Please copy and paste to your status if you know someone or have been affected by someone who needs a foot up their ass . People who need a foot up their ass affect the lives of many . There is still no cure for someone who needs a foot up their ass , except a foot up their ass . Please help raise awareness as 93% of people won't re-post this . Why ? Because they probably need a foot up their ass too !

please put this as your status for one hour if you or someone you know has , or has had , an invisible illness ( MS , Diabetes , Crohns , Autism , PCOS , Rheumatoid Arthritis , Kidney Disease , Epilepsy , Fibromyalgia , COPD , CHD , Depression , etc ) . Do it for all who have an invisible illness . It's a daily struggle feeling sick on the inside while you look fine on the outside !
