Coldstone Ice Cream for dinner is good for a grieving heart 

It's funny how someone can get so violently mad at you for expressing an opinion that they have had only because they themselves don't have the guts to say it .

I am a parent , cook , housekeeper , teacher , nurse , handy man , maid , security , coordinator , supervisor , manager , secretary , nutritionist , caretaker , personal assistant , life coach , bookkeeper , laundry maid , taxi driver and a motivational speaker .

While you SCREAM at your woman , there's a man wishing he could whisper softly in her ear ... While you HUMILIATE , OFFEND and INSULT her , there's a man flirting with her and reminding her how wonderful she is . While you HURT your woman , there's a man wishing he could make love to her . While you make your woman CRY there's a man \ 
stealing smiles from her ... Post if you're against Domestic Violence . 
Today is National Fibromyalgia Awareness Day . This is a ' Syndrome ' that gets looked over way too much , not just by society , but by the medical field . If you are someone living with pain of this ' Syndrome ' , or if you know/love/care about someone suffering through then post this on your wall ... Let's see if we can bring some much needed attention to Fibromyalgia !!! 
I so ROCK ... grades were finally released ... ALL A's!!!! 
FarmVille friends ... I only need 5 more nails and 3 more boards to complete my nursery . Can you please help ?? 
Needs someone here to kick my ass in gear .... :( 
Homework ... have to do homework ... kinda hard to do when the little girl above me is making my whole ceiling shake and about collapse .. ggggrrrr ... where the hell is the adult community ??? 
Why am I still awake when I only got 4 hours of sleep last night ?? 
Ok FarmVille is making me mad . Whenever I harvest eggs it doesn't put it into my Tuscan Wedding Tent . But yet when I harvest olives or truffles it does ... what's up with that ??? 
This should be interesting . POKE me if you ever had a crush on me . LIKE this status if you think im attractive . INBOX me if you ever wanted a relationship with me . COMMENTme if you want to be friends ......... now lets see who's brave enough to copy & paste this on their status .. 
For all my Farm Ville neighbors , I need puppy kibble please please please . Thanks ! 
< PROPFEMALE > is such a bitch .... but a flippin hilarious one LMAO 
I need more puppy kibble in Farm Ville please :)

RIP < PROPFIRST > , I love you and always will . 
Heading to Kansas City in a few hours for my friend's funeral ... can't believe this is happening . 
Finally back home ... still in a daze of disbelief . But I know < PROPFIRST > was still with us throughout this whole trip , looking over his family and watching over all those who traveled to LaMonte for his funeral . < PROPFIRST > you are so loved and always will be ... You will never be forgotten . 
Why do we always get shit on by the ones who supposedly love us ? 
In loving memory of every cancer patient , family member , and friend who has lost their battle with cancer and those who continue to conquer it ! Put this on your < PROPFEMALE > for 1 hour if you know someone who has or had cancer . Many won't copy and paste this . I did . Will you ?

Meeting United Protectors at the < PROPFEMALE > Shamrock at 44th Ave and < PROPMALE > Road at 1 PM to show support at PO 2nd Class < PROPFIRST > McNeley's funeral ( 2:30 PM at Mt Olivet Cemetery ) . Come down and show your support . 
Wow , what an honor . My thoughts and prayers will be with the McNeley family as they try to move on from this terrible ordeal . And thank you PGR and Rolling Thunder for the privilege to stand beside you all to show support for this family in their time of need . 
Off to a pool party .... hope it will be fun ! 
Off to the Challenged Athletes Foundation Benefit Concert at Sharp's Roadhouse in Commerce City . Come enjoy some music , drinks and great people with me . Hope to see you all there . 
AAHH so nice to be on vacation 
Finally home after a wonderful vacation . Feeling a bit out of touch with what is going on in the world around me , but wouldn't trade it for anything . Enjoyed the no electronics thing . 
I'm done caring and I'm done trying . And Lord if they come to me in a time of need , please understand if I refuse to be there for them . 
My bike is finally fixed and looks awesome . Took it out for a short drive this afternoon . Will probably go again this evening for a long ride . I'm so EXCITED !! 
I like it on my kitchen table . 
I also like it hanging from my front door . 
Don't you hate it when others try to tell you what you should be doing and how to do it , yet they themselves can't do the same ? 
Please put this on your status if you know someone or are related to someone who suffers from stupidity . People need to understand that stupidity is real and should be taken seriously . You could be sitting next to a sufferer right now . There is still no known cure for stupidity , and sympathy does not help but we can raise awareness .... 93% won't copy and paste this , because they don't know how to copy and paste . 
Had a GREAT night last night . Got to see < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Coe at the Grizzly < PROPFEMALE > . For being 71 , that man can still rock the house !! 
A BIG THANK YOU to all vets and to all those currently serving ... including my son and all the guys in his unit . Love all of you and can't wait for you to come home soon . Happy Veteran's Day !!!!

Wow what an incredible trip ... so good to spend some time with my brother one-on-one and made some new friends ... a big THANK YOU to my brother for having me and a big THANK YOU to < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE > for being so gracious and kind ... can't believe that it's already time to go home . 
It takes 7 seconds for food to pass from mouth to stomach . A human hair can hold 3kg . The length of a penis is 3 times the length of the thumb . The femur is as hard as concrete . A woman's heart beats faster than a man's . Women blink 2x as much as men . We use 300 muscles just to keep our balance when we stand . The woman has read this entire text . The man is still looking at his thumb . Repost if this made you smile .

Can't believe school is back in session already ... now just have to wrap my mind around studying again ... uugghh LOL :) 
I may not be the most beautiful , or the sexiest , nor do I have the perfect body . I might not be someone's first choice , but I am a great choice . I don't pretend to be someone I'm not , because I'm good at being me . I might not be proud of some of the things I've done in the past ...... but I'm proud of who I am today . Take me as I am ... or watch me as I walk away . 
RIP Grandma Jean ... I love you . I'm glad you are no longer in pain and that the Lord has you in a much better place . You will truely be missed .
