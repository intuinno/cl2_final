your slowly dyin youre denyin your health is declining with your self esteem no1 seems to know my struggle & everything i come from 
i'm stronger because of my hard times , & i know my weaknesses , i'm wiser because of my mistakes , & i`ve been foolish , i'm happier because of my sad times , & laugh because i`ve known my sadness , i am alive because i am a FiGHTER ... 
sometimes the hardest thing in life is to make the changes we need to the most , but we are too scared to let that guard down and feel that weak ... 
life doesn`t give you the people you want , it gives you the people you need to help you , hurt you , love you , & to make you the person you`re meant to be ...

her feelings she hides . her dreams she can`t find . she`s losing her mind . she`s fallen behind . she can`t find her place . she`s losing her faith . she`s fallen from grace . she`s all over the place ; too many problems don`t know where she belongs , it`s where she lies , broken inside . open your eyes & look outside , find the reasons why . you`ve been rejected , & now you can`t find what you left behind .. 
wake up , bakee * up , gotta get < PROPFEMALE > cake up

happy birthday to my beautiful , precious niece ! love you with all my heart bri <3 
i knock on the door , hope isnt home , faith`s not around the luck`s all gone , dont ask me whats wrong , ask me whats right & i`ma tell you whats life ... 
gettin poppin 2nite ciROc n dat pifff wit tha homies !! 
word bout to hit up ALtERED NIGHtMARES tonight .. yoo scariest shit out ! 
i have to tell the one that i once adored , that they can`t have my love no more , cause my heart can`t take no more lies , & my eyes are all out of cries , now all i wanted to do was to feel your touch , & give you all my love , but you took my love for granted .. 
life doesn`t give you the people you want , it gives you the people you need to help you , hurt you , love you , to make you the person you were meant to be ... 
don`t judge me for doing the best with what i`ve been given .. judge yourself for judging people without knowing their story ... 
hope for the best , prepare for the worst , fight for what you believe , expecting nothing , & you`ll never be disappointed in all that life throws at you ... 
everyday i need an ounce & a half it take a blunt just to ease the pain that humble me now\ 
& i`d rather roll somethin up\ 
... cuz if i`m sober dogg , i just might flip , grab my guns & hold somethin up\ 
i get high as a kite\ 
i`m in the zone all alone , muthafucka im dyin tonight\ 
so i roll em up back to back , fat as i could 
jus anotha ciroc&sour weekend w . tha homies :) 
thinkin of a masterr plan * ha- 
the world is yours , so play the role . let`s \ 
have a toast , & raise our drinks . no hearts on our sleeves , just eagles on \ 
our cuff links . we`ll get high , & hide . we all lust to the glamorous , white girl so fine . going up on the downtown line . take your razor , break down my line . put your nose to the speaker . now breathe in ... 
time for a change , hope this shit works out .. 
i fell for this so many times , it`s ridiculous & still i stick with this , i`m sick of this , in my sickness & addiction , your addictive as they get , evil as they come , vindictive as they make em , i`m addicted to the pain , the stress , the drama , so i guess imma mess cursed & blessed , but this time i ain`t changing my mind , but when you spoke of people who meant the most to you , you left me off your list ... 
Life doesn`t give you the people you want , it gives you the people you need . To help you , to hurt you , to love you , to leave you , & to make you into the person you were meant to be . 
i`m from where the summers dangerous , the winters is cold & bitches pop Zan X`s like birth control , i got bitches on death row , stuck with a cell number , so close to Jesus they got his cell number , the ghetto is trife , this is my life , that's how we do it dawg , these the last days , yeah i had my bad days , i been through it ch'all , but i grew back , the sun never shines in the ghetto , it always rains in the hood ... 
to takin a long walk , down the wrong path all i know is pain , everything i did wrong i did it in vain , that`s why only the strong survive , i will maintain what you know about pain ? blood , sweat & tears where i`m standin in the rain if i don`t blow < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > i`m goin insane i was in the fast < PROPFIRST > , a lot that i regret i got sins too , lot of foul shit that i been through , i`m just tryin to maintain up to the end .. 
you wanna hate , have a nice time , while i get stupid paper , hey my dough aint in its right mind ... 
why is it we ignore the ones that adore us , adore the ones that ignore us , love the ones that hurt us & hurt the ones that love us ... 
i don`t got a word to say , i don`t take shit frum no one , so i fLip that middLe finger & than index finger foLLows ...
