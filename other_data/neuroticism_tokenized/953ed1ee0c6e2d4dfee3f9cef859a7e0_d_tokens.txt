Multiply that by 55.459 
That seems like a lot , don't it . 
In fact it'll make 2993 , don't bother doing the calculations . Take my first post paste it on word , copy it and paste it 55 times in a row . 
You'll see 2993 ones looks like a lot more than one 2993 . 
And American's still question our fight against global terrorism . Get Real ! 
1st all-nighter of the school year :) 
They make perfect sense ... perfect percent of the time ... perfect by the definition of perfection by majority ... therefor perfect is nonperfect ... but then if perfect is nonperfect by definition by majority ... it is a faulty statement ... because my posts always make sense . That's right :) 
Getting the H1N1 vaccination tomorrow morning :) 
What is life when you lose the one you love . 
Once < PROPMALE > Schenn matures ... him and < PROPFIRST > Phaneuf will be hurting people in the Air Canada Centre . Two of the hardest hitters in the NHL . 
Sabres failed tonight ... poor performance . 
Kovalchuk wouldn't accept a 10-year $100-million contract in Atlanta so he is dealt to the playyoff-contention Devils . A true loss to the Thrashers ... New Jersey looks deadly now ! 
So I find out today that everytime my nephew < PROPMALE > ( who is two 1/2 ) sees < PROPMALE > Potter he says Uncle < PROPFIRST > . Apparently he's my look-alike . 
A sad sad day ... my first truck is going up for sale on Craigslist . 1993 Ford Ranger ... Splash ... Red ... * LOW LOW < PROPMALE > * ( 72,000 ) Just $2000 ! 
A Veteran is someone who at one point in their life wrote a blank check made payable to ' The United States of < PROPFEMALE>' , for an amount ' up to , and including their life ' . That is honor , and there are way too many people in this country today , who no longer understand that fact ! Copy and paste this if you are thankful for your freedom . 
It's official ... my truck has been sold )= 
Lets hope for a better night for the Sabres !

HHmmmm , Am I really gonna stay up ' till 3 in the morning to watch Braveheart ... without a doubt ! 
< PROPFIRST > is visiting Brockport this weekend ! 
Hitting the gym then watching Canada vs . Russia Olympic Hockey ... should be a great game ... Ovechkin vs . Crosby ( and some other players that the media don't think matter ) . 
Well Canada beat Russia ... now it's most likely up to the Swedes to take them out . Let's hope the Sedin's will do some damage . 
bought a Ukulele and am loving it ! 
Leaving for Brockport soon =)

Ya know we're gonna win that < PROPMALE > Cup , Yea ! Me and the Buffalo Sabres , Yea , Yea , Yea ! 
Therefore we do not lose heart . Though outwardly we are wasting away , yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day . For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal < PROPFEMALE > that far outweighs them all . So we fix our eyes not on what is seen , but on what is unseen . For what is seen is temporary , but what is unseen is eternal . 
Many are the plans in a man's heart , but it is the Lord's purpose that prevails . 
Well I found my way to trouble I found my way to pain Well but I’m so tired of trying To find my own way So I wanna get lost I wanna get lost in Your arms -- Sanctus Real 
Is anyone else excited that < PROPFEMALE > Lydman's and Henrik Tallinder's contracts expired !?

Going to see Iron Man 2 on Friday , Yes !!! 
Playin ' Hockey in the morning :) 
If the whole universe has no meaning , we should never have found out that it has no meaning : just as , if there were no light in the universe and therefore no creatures with eyes , we should never know it was dark . Dark would be a word without meaning . \
