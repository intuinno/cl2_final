Oh , yeah , now I start my essay . Brilliant . 
Two down , two to go . 
got the chills . 
People need to understand that children with special needs don't have an illness , there is no cure & it's not contagious . They only want what we all want , to be accepted . Most of you probably won't copy and paste this . Will you do it and leave it on your status for at least an hour ? It's Special Education week , and this is in honor of all the kids who need a little extra help & understanding . 
just saw The Glass Menagerie at The Pear Avenue Theatre . Spectacular ! 
is watching In Plain Sight out of pure boredom . Thank you Hulu for feeding into my < PROPFEMALE > to not sleep at a decent hour every night .

RAINBOWS ARE SIMPLY THE EFFECTS OF UNICORN RADIATION 
This week needs to start getting better . Its not going to ruin tomorrow for me . 
Today certainly turned out better . 
MADAME BUTTERFLY ! I cannot express how excited I am to be seeing the very opera that inspired me to take up singing . 
Is it horrible that the highlight of this weekend for me is that the Winter and Spring schedules went up ? Nothing gets me more excited than getting to plan out my classes . Sad . D: 
WHY AM I AWAKE ? 
DR . CHICKEN < PROPFIRST > 
I don't want to be awake . 
Oh homework . I really should stop procrastinating and get you done already . 
I WIN , COMPUTER ! 
Sleep . 
Not entirely awake . 
Tea , The IT Crowd and my baby blanket -- a recipe for feeling better . 
Thank you to whomever got me sick . This is obnoxious . No sooner do I think I'm getting better it makes a giant leap backwards . SHELI RAAAGGEEE ! 
Ah , yes , the Spee-eye-der . 
Just slept and Nyquil'd my way into health . Feeling a thousand times better ! <3 
Red is a very good movie , y'all should go and see it .

Pumpkin bread , pumpkin latte and Pulp Fiction . This is a wonderful morning . 
Anyone up for the Oakland Zoo today ? 
Oh lawdy . Linguistic and Physical Anthro projects . I'm at that point where things are starting to collide and not make sense anymore . But jalepenos on crackers are making it better .

I really don't want to be awake . 
Oh , Lion < PROPMALE > II , you speak to me on a deeper level . There is so much you can teach me about life . 
We have Netflix again . I wonder if I shoudl warn my mom that putting me in charge of the que means a lot of ridiculous movies are on their way . 
Moving slow . The only thing pushing me to go to school today is to hear some words on Pastafarianism . 
< PROPMALE > broke the internet . 
There is a Persia , California . And a Persia , Iowa . I will be greatly dissapointed if these places are not heavily inhabited by Persians . 
I had intentions of going to school today to take care of some paperwork , but instead I sat in bed all day reading my Physical Anthro book from cover to cover . I'm not sure how I feel about this . Its not entirely a waste . 
Because Netflix has all seasons of < PROPFEMALE > on Instant Play . That is why I live . 
Shaolin Soccer , another Asian Cinema masterpiece . No subtitles needed , I've watched the film enough that I've actually got the ( translated ) dialogue memorized . This is either a feather in my cap or another bead to my bedazzled vest of shame . 
Having a midlife crisis . Minus the midlife . Unless , of course , I'm only going to live to 40 . 
X-Files . This man either died or just had sex with a green ghost and kicked that bitch out the window when he was done .
