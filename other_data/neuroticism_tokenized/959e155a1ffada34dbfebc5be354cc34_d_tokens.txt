Everybody better be freaking careful . Drunk punks are driving on the wrong side of the road . 
I think I figured out the moonwalk ... it hurts my toes after a while though . 
So , I woke up early to make some cinnamin rolls and what do I find ? Some freaking landmines left on the stairs for me to step on ... I hate this dog ... 
burred , boord , boared , BORED ! 
Trapped in my basement because my sister's party has taken over the house . So ... bored ... 
Got my feel-good music and my feel-good snackage ... I'm chillin good . 
Just got a sweet laptop . It's crazy ... but now it's time to get rid of all the bloatware . 
Up for hangin out tomorrow ... you'll probably have to call and wake me up though . 
Just rearranged my room ... my internal clock must hate me right now . 
I know that I almost have all the time in the world , but I still feel rushed . 
Tired , Bored , and I don't want to go to bed ... weird . 
You know , you're not really \hacked\ " if you actually gave you're password to someone else ... just thought I'd throw that out there . " 
Just realized that today is the 4th ... 
You know you're lame when you would rather continue beating up your xbox to get it to work than pay for repairs . 
Gah !, it just hit me that everyone I grew up with in the last few years is leaving ! 
Heheh , my Xbox is wrecked . 
Tornadoes !!! 
Holy Crap ! If Almond Snickers taste like heaven I can only wonder what Normal Snickers taste like . 
... Did I miss something ? Why is everybody turning into cartoons ?!
