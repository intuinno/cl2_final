just got his mind blown out the window by a large hand grenade of an anime as he just marithon-ed all 26 episodes and has to curl up into a small ball to cope with the intense awesomeness . He also doubts he will ever relive this level of artistic awesomeness ever in his life and wished the ending wasn't so \OMG EVERYTHING IS SO HAPPY !!!!!! ... ... ... WTF DID I JUST SEE ?!?!?!? DID I JUST SEE THAT !?!?!? * End . *\""

I'm at the jazz erie concert and my step-dad just got 3 bottles of beer ... and he's probably driving us home ... :/ 
It's midnight and I have just listened to the most mind-blowing piece of music ever . Before you read further : Everyone has their taste in music and if you don't agree that's your opinion . It's an acapella ( For those that don't know , it's ALL voices . No instruments . ) piece , and YouTube quality doesn't even touch the quality of the Album . Link is in the comments . 
I'm on my way to believing . -Paramore
