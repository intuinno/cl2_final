wishes he hadnt messed up 
horrible weekend 
Fb\\n 
Help\\n(let it die ) 
people say pain is better than nothing ... but have they been pushed so far that they wish for nothing to take them away ? 
crown vic 
and yet when the happy ones call it a day it is the collective soul of all the dissapointed dreamers that control our tired minds 
when the day is done and those that are content in their disillusions turn out the lights ... what are those left behind left with but shattered dreams and misplaced trust 
wow ... this kinda sucks 
let it come and wash everything away 
butterknife dull but it still cuts through 
hell yea ! eclipse is badass 
im so sad ... megan fox got married 
does Not like it when dr pepper disapears while im sleeping ... fuck you physics 
wow ... i work eleven days in a row ... gay 
bored ... txt it up 
so ... m2 and fitzy are starting a nightclub/bakery named drury < PROPFIRST > . his name is now snaps < PROPFEMALE > and mine is muffin man ... our shirts will say butter that muffin unless someone can think of anything better ! 
i am just about tired of the human race . 
found him with his face down in the pillows\ 
with a note that said i'll love her til i die\ 
and when we laid him beneith the willow ... the angels sang a whiskey lullaby 
feels really stupid 
well in my vast knowledge and wisdom \cough cough bullshit\ " i have discovered something ... love is both the greatest joy and coldest pain ... being in love is equal to being immortal ... but the loss of someone's love is more sharp and deep a pain than any sword or bullet can reach " 
anyone who has leiker needs to comment 
bored once again ... txt it 
a hero of war\ 
is that what they see ? \ 
just medals and scars\ 
so damn proud of me\ 
and i brought home that flag 
12 more days until i get to see < PROPFIRST > mcCaartney in concert !!!!! 
to all of the people who go to restraunts late ... i hate you 
now my body's on the floor\ 
and i'm calling ... im calling out to you 
seems to be the trend now so like this and i will tell you what i like , dislike , and my confession/first impression 
kinda tired ... stressed ... angry ... worried unreasonably ... gotta love mondays 
sometimes i wish i didnt care and that i dont need you but im hooked like a fish and im running out of water 
falling in love is easy ... but the landing can be hard 
long live obama and free thinkers ! 
let it be known that the hardest thing to fix is a broken heart 
bittersweet day !!! < PROPFIRST > mccartney tonight =] but my cat broke his leg and idk how much to fix it ='[ 
when you're findin things to not to fall asleep cause you shes waiting in you're dreams ... that's when she's ... more than a memory 
long live Sir < PROPFIRST > McCartney !!!! 
is feeling pretty stupid 
wishes he wasn't so easily annoyed by people ... for no reason , just being around people pisses me off , but at the same time im lonely ... dont know what to do 
well ... got my yearbook , i looked like shit lol oh well better luck this year 
i've got to get out , im tired of it all 
Sunshine sunshine is fine feel it in my skin warmin up my mind , sometimes ya gotta give in , to when your love relies , let it shine , oh let it shine 
couldnt help but fall , but that sure as hell wasnt a nice landing 
you and me baby aint nothin but mammals , so lets do it like they do on the discovery channel 
optimisms a thing of the past ... better to just expect the pain that you cant avoid no matter how much you ignore its aproach 
you just gotta push through the bullshit and hope like hell that theres something better waiting for you 
quarter after six and still not tired ... somethin wrong with that 
you're holdin the rope and im takin the fall 
is kinda stoked now that i know OHCE is just around the corner !!! hurry the hell up halloween , i need me a night of soda and cold weather lol

well ... the night couldve gone alot better but still had a good time 
it's 4:03 and i cant sleep , without you next to me i toss and turn like the sea 
surrounded by people and yet completely alone 
needs to find someone who can make me feel right 
so theres this girl ... 
your heavens trying everything to keep me out 
pissed off 
likes people who ask how youre doing but dont stick around to hear the answer lol 
its hot outside let me go swimmin in your eyes 
does NOT need a sheltered church rat to tell me what to believe . you know who you are 
we are immortal in our thoughts if we choose to be . and by god i do , so lend your pen and paper so i may make my spirit alive in these blackened vines of ink 
this is why i am valuable ... and you are not 
with the radio up your face fades away .. flicker flicker dim and fade to black 
maybe next time ill listen
