The boys went to get me some new tires on my car while I continue working on all the client work I have to complete today . Good to be busy !!!! 

It's a beautiful day for a Father's Day celebration ! 
Working , working working !!! 
is packing for her family vacation to Florida tomorrow . 
is spending her last day in Florida and will head back to < PROPMALE > tomorrow ! 
Although it is a beautiful day outside , I am diligently working at my computer like the responsible person I am ! 
Dawson was so happy to go to school today ! I don't remember being that excited when I was in first grade ! 
Oh what a beautiful day outside ! A little rain but you can't beat the temperature ! 
Dawson is home sick today with fever and cough . Even though he feels bad , he finds it very hard to stay in bed and get some rest . Amazing how kids still want to run around and play when they are sick ! 
Fever , fever and more fever . Dawson's still got the fever ... 
Fever has gone away and Dawson has gone to school ! Yippy ! 
I am a bit embarred to admit this , but Saturday Night Fever by the < PROPFEMALE > Gees popped up on Pandora and I feel a bit sentimental for the crazy disco music of the seventies !! Somebody snap me out of it !!!! 
Today , 21 years ago , I met the love of my life , < PROPMALE > . It's hard to believe I have known him nearly half of my life Wow !!! 
I just registered for the Race for the Cure this Sunday . Janrace Prudent is walking with me . It was her idea to walk 5k at 8 AM on a Sunday morning . But such a good cause is worth getting up early for ! Anyone else Racing Sunday ? 
Hard to believe that it is 5:00 AM and I am up ! Heading out to do the The Race for the Cure ... 
I am going to lose my mind watching this Rockies game !!! 
Happy Monday to all ! Burr , it was cold this morning but the sun is shining and it's starting to warm up , a little . I am working so hard at my computer it is putting out some serious heat , keeping me warm and toasty ! 
Bring on the snow tomorrow , I'm ready !!! The snow shovel is itching to be used !! By < PROPMALE > of course ( while I supervise) ! 
Snow day for Dawson today ! Almost 6 inches here already . Better get < PROPMALE > out with that snow shovel ASAP !!! 
With all this snow the roads out here near Brighton are only wet ! Imagine that ! 
Dawson is so happy that he has another snow day ! And , as if it couldn't get any better , Halloween is in 2 days !!! Oh , to experience the simple joys of being a kid again . 
Heading over to Dawson's class soon for his Halloween Party ! Should be tons of fun . I will take photos ! ( If I remember to take my camera !! ) 
29 again ! How is this possible ???? It seems that I have not aged for the last 14 years . Every birthday is 29 ! See Janrace Prudent I am not old enough to be your mother , I am the same age as you !!!! 
Thanks to everyone for all the birthday wishes !!! It really made my day ! 
16 years today , I found my birth mom , < PROPFIRST > Sumrall Jarnutowski !!! Happy Anniversary Mom ! 
Happy Thanksgiving everyone !!!! 
Boy is it cold outside ! Love the snow though !!! More coming tonight !!! 
There is no such thing as failure . Rather , it's called Successive Approximation : getting closer and closer to successful performance through the feedback provided by miskates . Mistakes are not to be feared ! Each one brings you one step closer to your goal ! 
Gluten free menu at PF Changs is terrific ! Had the Shrimp with Lobster sauce . Very good !! 
Let it snow , let it snow , let is snow ! 
The boys are playing < PROPFIRST > on the WII and I am show great discipline and motivation by putting myself in front of my computer and WORKING !! 
Today's < PROPMALE > and I's 20th wedding anniversary ! I love as much today as I did 20 years ago ( maybe even more ! ) ! 
I'm looking forward to seeing if < PROPMALE > can stay up to midnight tonight ! Five bucks says he's asleep by 11:00 ! Betting is now open if anyone's interested !!! 
Happy New Year Everyone !!! Going to be a great odd year !!! 
The first work day of the new year is always full of promise and excitement ( at least for me it is) ! If you have goals , write them down ! Statistics show that you are 80% more likely to meet your goals is you WRITE THEM DOWN ! I resisted this for years but am now a convert . Every time I write down my goals ( reasonable ones of course ) , I achieve them . 
Can't wait for my EMG this afternoon ! I so love having electricity interntionally sent through my nerves just to see how they will react . Great way to spend a Tuesday afternoon , don't you think ? 
There's been quite a bit of talk about goals this week . What are you doing to make sure you reach those goals ? Having an accountability partner would ensure that someone other than yourself holds you accountable . Your partner would also be the one holding you accountable for your goals . I would love to have an accountability partner . If anyone is interested and is serious about meeting their goals , let me know ! 
Lets see how honest FB friends are . Leave a 1 word comment that you think best describes me . It can only be 1 word . No more than 1 word . Then copy & paste this post on your wall so I can leave a word about you . This should be interesting ... Wonder if I have 20 brave friends who will do this . 
It's a great Monday !! Look at your goals , stay on track , be hopeful and get some success going !! 
The treadmill and I are slowly starting to get reacquanted with each other after a long time apart . We have had two meetings in as many days and although it has strong feelings about being rejected by me for so long , I think we can mend our fragile relationship . 
Happy Hump Day ! Feels like early spring outside . I like the cold but I'll take the warmer temps after all that single digit weather . Have a terrific day everyone !!! 
Treadmill update : After three days together , my treadmill is starting to warm up to me . It is still stinging from the nearly 3 year rejection of my affections but is trying to work on forgiveness . I have given it undivided attention for at least 20 minutes , three days in a row . I think this is helping ! It has gently reminded me that I need to start doing intervals sooner than later . It really likes those . 
I love this time of night , after everyone has gone to bed . I have the next few hours to completely concentrate on work with no interruptions . I get so much accomplished after 9 PM . Gotta throw some TV watching in there too ! 
Looking forward to Dawson's first basketball game today . He is so excited !! 
Busy , busy Monday !!! But that is a good thing !!! 
The average FB user has 130 friends . If all of my 186 friends and their 130 friends donated $10 to the Haiti relief effort by texting GIVE to 50555 that would generate $ 241,800 !! Please do what you can to help . What the people of Haiti are going through is not just a tragedy for Haiti , but a tragedy for humanity . Please help by copying this post and sharing it with your friends !! 
Great weekend ! Sorry to see it end but looking forward to the week ahead ! 
It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood , a beautiful day for a neighbor , would you be mine , could you be mine , please won't you be my neighbor ?

My trip down memory < PROPFIRST > tonight was quite interesting and eye opening ! 
A busy Friday caps off a very busy week ! Going to see Dawson perform a folk dance today with his class . I am so excited !! 
Today I am working on designing a new menu for a magnificant restuarant in Littleton , NoNo's Cafe . They have the best southern , New Orleans and Cajun food . They are at 3005 West County Line Road . 303-738-8330 . If you go , ask for < PROPFIRST > and tell him < PROPFEMALE > sent you ! 
It's been a whirlwind day of work , work and more work ! That's a good thing !! 
Baseketball at noon , Build a Bear later ! Dawson has expressed extreme interest in going to build a < PROPFIRST>'s Bear . Strange considering he doesn't really like stuffed animals . I love Build a Bear and am so excited to go !!! Maybe I will build a bear for myself !!! 
Does anyone know a recruiting company that specializes in IT positions ? I have a friend whose husband is looking for a new position in the IT field and is also willing to relocate . Any help would be greatly appreciated !! 
My mom lost her oldest dog , Bear , yesterday . She is very sad and finding it hard to get through her dat at work . It is so hard to lose a pet . It's a pain like no other . If you have a moment , send some thoughts her way ... < PROPFIRST > Sumrall Jarnutowski

Great post I had to share : I was reminded of something important : If you're not being treated with love & respect , check your price tag . Perhaps you've marked yourself down . It's YOU who tells people what you're worth by what you accept . Get off the clearance rack and get behind the glass where they keep the valuables ! LEARN to value yourself more ! If you don't , no one else will ! Re-post if you like , you may help someone see just how valuable they are .
