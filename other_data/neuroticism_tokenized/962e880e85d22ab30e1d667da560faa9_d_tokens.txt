Studying for History . Anyone want to help ? 
Holy crap . It just dawned on me that we don't have to go to school on Monday . 
SFA starts today . 
The Lady Gaga episode of Glee is on after American Idol tonight . :) 
So , I saw this commercial the other day about WoW . It had Mr. T in it saying how he plays WoW and stuff . Apparantly there is some new weapon that is gives any player a Mr. T Mohawk when it's thrown at them . That's frickin awesome . It slightly makes me want to start playing WoW , but only slightly .

is the proud owner of a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Snuggie . I don't care what people say , although Snuggies are weird they are the most comfortable things in the world . Whoever decided to put sleeves on a blanket is a genius . 
Just got back from Toy Story 3 . It was pretty awesome . 
Do roaches normally fly ? The biggest roach I've ever seen just flew into my living room and was sitting on the ceiling until my mom whacked it with a broom . I almost freaked out . I hate cockeroaches . 
It's opening night of West Side Story . :) 
Opening night rocked . I think I'm starting to get the < PROPFEMALE > of working spotlight . 
Just finished downloading the new software update on my ipod . Good news is that the new features are awesome . Bad news , it wiped all my information from my ipod and I had to rebuild everything . 
I can't believe SFA is over . 
Just got back from The Last Airbender . It wasn't as bad as I expected , but they pronounced Aang , Sokka , and Iroh wrong the whole movie . 
Dinosaur shaped chicken nuggets make me a very happy person . 
I have found my new favorite app . It's just like Halo , except for iPods . It is amazing . 
Just think , this time next week , we'll be in school .
