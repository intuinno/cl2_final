Hopes to sample some exquisite < PROPMALE > beer tonight . Of course , I hoped to sample some asian women in 2009 and all I got was , yep , you guessed it : white women . The irony of life is far-reaching ... 
These are the times that try men's souls . The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will shrink from the service of their country ; but he that stands by it now , deserves the love and thanks of man and woman . Tyranny is not easily conquered ; yet we have this consolation with us , that the harder the conflict , the more glorious the triumph . What we obtain too cheap , we esteem too lightly . \

Ive tried numerous dating sites at this point to see if I could find something special , and im happy to say that ive found a site that has everything I wanted and more . Not only does Amazon.com offer the best prices , but it also has a selcection of nationalities that a man like myself could never get bored with . She doesnt care that I cant speak Vietnamese , I have canned food ! She even loves my cat ... 
Eating some delicious chicken and sausage gumbo . It doesnt get much better then cajun ... Road House . 
Just got back from ice skating , man that was super fun ! Ive found a new hobby ... 
Gym early in the morning , then ten hours of engineering classes tomorrow . Weird schedule , but I just think about tasty spaghetti and it makes me smile ... 
Our solace is , the sad road lies so clear . It needs no < PROPMALE > , With faint , averted feet And many a tear , In our opposed paths to persevere . 
Captain's log : Stardate 46731.5 . We have recently started the semester and while staying very busy , everything has went well . Work at Kellog's snacks remains routine and dull , but a necessity none the less . Workout strength has increased by 1.7% , which is unusual at this time of year . Im hoping this will impress Counselor Troi , whose husband recently died in a bizarre phaser training routine . 
My mind rebels at stagnation . Give me problems . Give me work . Data , data , data—I can't make bricks without < PROPMALE > . 
I came to the woods because I wished to live deliberately , to front only the essential facts of life , and see if I could not learn what it had to teach . And not , when I came to die , discover that I have not lived . -Thoreau 
< PROPFEMALE > ns against the redistribution of wealth ? Does a poor child have the same < PROPMALE > as a < PROPMALE > child in < PROPFEMALE > ? Facts suggest that poor children have parents who have fewer economic and social resources to provide the children . Compare this to a child from a wealthy family whos parents can afford tutors and private schooling . The United States has one of the highest degrees of inequality in distribution of income .

The nonconformist who conforms to nonconformity wonders how the liberal liberates his mind from the libertarians ' litigations . The propaganda of proposing conservation of the thoughts of conservatives consecrates this calamity . Perhaps the analogy of anarchism to that of marxism muffles this facist facade . The existentialist thought of personal purpose perpetrates the pessimistic peoples of a demonic democracy . 
Two final exams out of the way , four more to go ... 
Why is it so hard to seperate the ideas of morality and religion ? Why cling to the idea of a celestial dictatorship ? I think most have a vague idea , but are unwilling to come to terms with it in a sense . Fear , chaos , order , mortality , satisfaction , control , comfort , optimism ? Hmmm ... is \ignorance bliss\ " or will \ " the truth set you free\ " ? The irony of this is quite broad . " 
Ready for the summer semester , at least the pace will slow slightly . Time to crank up the intensity in the gym ... 
I want the seals of power and place , \ 
The ensigns of command , \ 
Charged by the people's unbought grace , \ 
To rule my native land . \ 
Nor crown nor sceptre would I ask , \ 
But from my country's will , \ 
By day , by night , to ply the task\ 
Her cup of bliss to fill . \

The work ethic of Sisyphus is rivaled only by Pac-Man's insatiable appetite for ghost monsters . At which point the former gives up , the latter becomes full . 
Allow me to explain . Here is the axis of time , where all times cross . When I first attempted time travel , fate , in its infinite wisdom , through me off course into this , the contemporal control center of exisentence . It has taken me centuries to discover its many powers , but working here outside of time , those centuries in your time have been merely the blink of an eye . 
Made a 750 on the quantitative ( math ) section of the GRE yesterday , totaled a 1200 . Not sure if I want to go to grad school yet but its always nice to have an ace up your sleeve . 
Thanks so much to all of my wonderful family and friends for the birthday wishes , I had a great day yesterday ! 
A big heart , intelligence , staying in shape , and compromising all of your time and ideals may be important , but the most important things in life is the size and appearance of your jewelery , the expense of your car , and where you buy your clothes from .

I had a great morning with my step-father today . A man will always earn my respect when he takes time out of his day to help you even when he doesnt have to .

I pull out my fiddle and I rosin ' up the bow\ 
The kids are asleep so I keep it kinda low\

Well , I got me a fine cat , I got me old skittles\

I sometimes question the strength of a democracy when the majority of its people flagrantly display naivety and the ease at which they are manipulated . I truly fear a country that says that a place of worship cant be built near an atrocity commited by extremists of that religion . If this is the case , then no churches should be allowed to be built anywhere near where a christian(s ) commited murder or heinous acts . 
Workouts at five in the morning always help start the day off right ! 
My brother and I were somewhat unsuccessful at grilling hamburgers for the family yesterday . But while they were slightly pink on the inside they were still delicious . At least the potato chips turned out ok ! 
Time to do some chalk and deadlifts after sitting in class all day . 
Long day at work , looking forward to kicking back and relaxing this evening . 
Strength is irrelevant . Resistance is futile . We wish to improve ourselves . We will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own . Your culture will adapt to service ours . We enjoy Old Bay seasoning on our crabs . Acid reflux is irrelevant . \

Trying to figure out the best way to get out of a bad situation . 
To Kitten : I find myself intrigued by your subvocal oscillations , A singular development of cat communications , That obviates your basic hedonistic predilection For a rhythmic stroking of your fur to demonstrate affection . A tail is quite essential for your acrobatic talents ; You would not be so agile if you lacked its counterbalance . 
Once upon a midnight dreary , while I drank a stout and studied female theory , At a club full of wretched and forgotten whores , while I stuttered strongly yapping suddenly there came a tapping , as if some woman gently tapping , tapping underneath my blue < PROPFIRST>'s drawers .

You were way out of line , \ 
went and turned it all around on me again . \ 
How can I not smell your lie\

But , now I know . \ 
So , you will not get away with it again . \ 
I'm distant in those hollow eyes\ 
for I have reached my end . \ 
Thank you for making me\ 
feel like I am guilty , \ 
making it easy to murder your sweet memory . \ 
Before I go , tell me ... \ 
Were you ever who you claimed yourself to be ? 
Another fun day at Siemens Energy . Tons of work to do , but anything worth having in life is worth working for . 
It was so hot in < PROPFEMALE > today , I saw a squirrel rubbing sunblock on his nuts . 
And as time passed by , she was less like the caring hobbit from the Shire , and more like the obsessive Gollum who desired only the ring .

My brother and I are riding out to Florida on Thursday . Looking forward to seeing some familly and getting out of town . 
I was given the wardrobe of a nobleman , and so I played the part . A puppet , ever dancing for the amusement of patrons unseen . This wretched world does not reward endeavor . It is the patron and his troupe who are reciept ... maggots grown fat on endeavor's corpse . Most men but play the part they're given . Most live and die not knowing they play a part at all . \

The reeking masses yearn for gods and miracles . It is their opiate , and they consume it greedily . The people do not endeavor towards greatness , but rather mire themselves in their petty strifes - shackles on the feet of man .

Tell a devout Christian that his wife is cheating on him , or that frozen yogurt can make a man invisible , and he is likely to require as much evidence as anyone else .

For some reason I have had an insatiable urge to listen to banjo music/bluegrass while I study for my final exams . The fiddle is on fire tonight ! 
The high ambition , therefore , seems to me to be this : That one should strive to combine the maximum of impatience with the maximum of skepticism , the maximum of hatred of injustice and irrationality with the maximum of ironic self-criticism . This would mean really deciding to learn from history rather than invoking or sloganising it . \

Just look at that face , the face of a thinker . A warrior , a man for all seasons . Yes , < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > was all that and more , but he was not perfect . Perhaps his greatest flaw was that he was too selfless , he cared too much for his fellow man with nary a thought for himself . A man of limitless accomplishments , and unbridled modesty . I can safely say that to know him was to love him , and to love him was to know him . 
Be very wary of of opinions that flatter your self-esteem . Both men and women , nine times out of ten , are firmly convinced of the superior excellence of their own sex .

One of the surprising discoveries of modern psychology is how easy it is to be ignorant of your own ignorance .

How do I know that the world as it appears to me in my experience is anything like the world is in itself beyond my experience ? Does this question have real meaning or is it simply the quest for an answer that gives us individual meaning ?

You're here because you know something . What you know , you can't explain . But you feel it . You felt it your entire life . That there's something wrong with the world .

Rendering oneself unarmed when one had been the best-armed , out of a height of feeling-that is the means to real peace , which must always rest on a peace of mind ; whereas the so-called armed peace , as it now exists in all countries , is the absence of peace of mind . One trusts neither oneself nor one's neighbor and , half from hatred , half from fear , does not lay down arms . 
You are young and wish for a child and marriage . But I ask you : Are you a man entitled to wish for a child ?

Or lack of peace with your yourself ? \
