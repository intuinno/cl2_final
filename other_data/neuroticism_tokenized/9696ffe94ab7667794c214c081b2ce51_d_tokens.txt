would like people to know i am sorry i didnt log off my profile before somebody else got on my computer . They evidently had strong feelings , i am sorry again for any offenses . I know this is hard to believe , but trust me , i would never make that strong of a statement publicly , that is to be looked down upon . I do disagree with things , but not like that . I hope you will accept this apology 
would like to say to all of those that saw my earlier posts , that i deleted , that i did not put them there , i was hacked somehow . I would never post something that enthusiastic about the subject . I dont ever like to make political statements as enthusiastic , overly opinionated , and controversial as those were . I once again want to apologize .

It takes courage to know you are right and to never waver , it takes cowardliness to allow somebody to do something fundamentally against you and apologize for your previous beliefs

In England , property owners are being warned not to put wire mesh over their shed windows , because burglars might injure themselves on it while breaking in . \
