I've been holding out , looks like I'm in now 

Wonders why this morning the gas station attendant only washed his back window . Do I look like the type of guy that drives in reverse more than other people , because I kind of feel that like 99% of the time I’m driving forward ? 
The Hurt Locker is a cool , crazy movie . 
94 degrees at 10:10 at night ... not cool ! 
Wonders why ... If the human body’s typical median temperature is 98.6 , and it is 105 out , shouldn’t I be more comfortable today than let’s say on a 72 degree day ? 
Walking around in the 105+ heat has got me thinking . 1 . I know why violent crimes increase during the summer 2 . When did togas become socially unacceptable ? 3 . Freezable Underwear ? 
Just finished watching Seven Pounds ... awesome movie 
Does not like working late on a Friday 
Oh lord just turned on NBC to find NFL FOOTBALL . Life can now begin again ! 
Loves watching episodes of The A-team on Hulu . 
Tonight was the toughest night in college football for me , who to hate more . I guess Oregon has a Zer-O on each side of their helmets for a reason . What a bunch of DB's . Take a lose like a men . Blount your a BD . 
Pigs do fly . Way to go Vandals ! 
Loves Seahawks games 
My week just got so much better , over the weekend they chnaged my statistics prof . Apparently I now have the super funny cool one that gives out tons of A's , instead of the crappy one that fails everyone and makes fun of you . Things are looking up . 
Wow , could my saturday morning being any more fun ? I just love making cummalitve frequency charts on excel . Plus side Vandals / CSU game today .

What is on my mind .... 5-1 
5-1 Vandals , just what I like to see .

One of the best parts of Friday night ... knowing that you don't have to set your alarm for the morning . 
What was the #1 song on the day you were born ? Google the date and #1 billboard song . Copy and paste with yours . Mine : Mama Told Me Not To Come by Three Dog Night . Does anyone else see the irony in this ? 
I wish Portland was getting some snow ... this rain sucks , and I could use a snow day . 
Nov . 7 ... Giants at Seattle . Can't wait to wear Giants ' gear into Quest , I'm afraid to say this one might get ugly . 
Portland - Bringn ' the pain 
When I grow up , I want to be Magnum P.I. 
The best part of training for this half marathon is the need\ 
for mass quantities of carbs . I also find it fortuitous that beer is all\ 
carbs . 
Yankees beat Boston what a huge surprise 
Adding < PROPMALE > , dropping minutes , and about to replace all those burnt up carbs with new liquid ones . 
Are we there yet ? How much longer ? 
Timbers beat Boca . Awesome game 
Not excited to be up this early 
Wonders in Idaho has a < PROPMALE > at winning the WAC this year now that the donkies are heading to the Mountain West . 
Registered for Lacamas Lake Half \ 
Marathon 2010 . 
Nice solid 10 miler this morning ... 1650 free calories to play with today . Time to hit those liquid carbs . One beer @140 calories , you do the math . 
Tired of running in the rain 
Wow , what I wouldn't do for 12 < PROPMALE > of beautiful bouncy Jersey Shore Boardwalk for this weekend's run . 
Well it is done ... Bib #6182 for 10.10.10 . aka \The Portland Marathon\ " . Let the games begin . " 
What do you like better Christmas or wedding season ? 
Crazy Weekend Coming Up . \ 
Friday Night : Snoop Dog & Ice Cube\ 
Sat . Night : Manchester ( Eng . ) vs . Timbers Exhibition Game\ 
Sun . Morn . : 8-ish mile run\ 
Sun . Night : Home Depot with a quick stop at Bed Bath and Beyond ... if I have time . 
Thanks for all the birthday wishes , it was a good day . And the evening , well ... I'm not at work . 
3 days until Sunday's race . It will be the first competitive\ 
sporting event I’ve taken part in , in 14 years . Planning on running like\ 
a gazelle . Really ? Let's be honest it will be more like a freight\ 
train going downhill with no brakes . Either way I plan on unleashing the\ 
fury . 
The hell is complete . First half Marathon in the books 
Question ? \

Hello DC 
On the way to NJ 
Having a serious case of < PROPFEMALE > vue . Painting in New Jersey , with random radio hits from < PROPFEMALE > Jam , Smashing Pumpkins and the Boss ... it is like I'm 18 again . Weird ! 
I know why I don't paint anymore . If painting moldings and doors doesn't make you crazy the paint fumes will . 
Just heard the new Devo song . Best song I've hared from them in like .... 25 years . 
Heading back to Portland . Excited to see my friends . Translation , who up for some beers this week ?
