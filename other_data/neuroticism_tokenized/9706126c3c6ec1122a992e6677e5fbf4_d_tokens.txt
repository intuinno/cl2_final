Checked out apartments today . Looks like I'm moving into Confederate Points next Friday ... \ 
\ 
With no bed or any other furniture . S'okay .. They're just minor details , right ? 

Woke up with a bad fever , boyfriend nursed me back to health . I think I need to get sick more often . 
\The most desired gift of love is not diamonds or roses or chocolate . It is focused attention . \"" 
Approved for the apartment- - .. shit . D: 
So it's official .. The boyfriend and I have our own place . Double fuck . D: 
I'm too lazy to update my status 
Ready for this day to be over already .. 
No sleep tonight .. 
Phone broke , can't get any calls or texts D: 
The woods are lovely , dark and deep . \ 
But I have promises to keep , \ 
And < PROPMALE > to go before I sleep ... 
Back in New York ... 
Sick ... ._. 
Just when you think things are going well .. 
“Women are strange and incomprehensible , a device invented by Providence to keep the wit of man well sharpened by constant employment . ” 
About time for a haircut .. Any ideas ? Suggestions ? Pictures ? 
Me : \Ahh .. I have $28 dollars left .. \ " \
