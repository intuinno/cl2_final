I just watched \Moulin Rouge\ " for the first time in years . I laughed through the first hour and cried through the second . I seem to be on a Ewan McGregor kick lately . " 

LMFAO . I periodically like to freak < PROPFIRST > out by showing him things that upset him . I got him good tonight ! I go through phases where I like a p < PROPMALE > icular actor's work so I go through and watch all of their movies , even rare < PROPMALE > house ones that I'd normal 
Listening to \The Moulin Rouge\ " soundtrack . Who knew < PROPFEMALE > Kidman and Ewan McGregor had such great voices ? " 
is feeling lonely tonight .... 
If you are reading this , even if we don't speak often , post a comment with a memory of you and me . When you've finished , post this paragraph on your own status and you'll be surprised at what people remember about you ... 
The 4th was one of my wedding anniversaries . < PROPFIRST > and I didn't do anything really . We watched \Taken\ " which is a great movie . My parents flew out to visit but didn't get in until after 2:30 am ! And even with their GPS they got very lost . That's the back " 
Lots of stuff going on . My parents are visiting from CA . The 4th of July was one of my wedding anniversaries ! < PROPFIRST > was here for a few days ! But sadly I'll be lucky to see him for a day and a half in three weeks . Sigh . 
I have a CT scan of my brain scheduled for tomorrow afternoon . I'm not terribly thrilled , especially since < PROPFIRST > can't be there , but I've had one before ( of my gallbladder ) and it's painless so I'll survive . The sad thing is that I can't even remember why 
Had my CT scan today . In and out in 5 minutes . It felt like going through tests in an alien spaceship . Anyone that's seen a cat scan will understand . 
The stray cat that had two litters of kittens came into the house this week . She was so pregnant she looked like she would pop . Her name is Mommy Cat for obvious reasons . She had her litter today ! < PROPFIRST > was guessing 4 kittens , I was guessing 3 ( she had 
Trying a new muscle relaxer tonight . Hope I don't die . The last two made me REALLY sick . My heart was beating erratically . It sucks that < PROPFIRST > is so far away , if I have a problem there's no one here to help ! 
It turns out my fears about taking those new muscle relaxers last night were founded . Obviously I didn't die , but I had a hard time breathing . It felt like someone was sitting on my chest and I could only take shallow breaths . I was scared to go to sle 
Can't sleep . In pain . Must get new muscle relaxers ! Even the muscles in my face are so tight they hurt just to touch them ! Any suggestions ? 
I'm sick and I want my husband . But the soonest he can be here isn't for another week ! 
I watched \A Life Less Ordinary\ " with Ewan McGregor and < PROPFIRST > Diaz . Cute . Different . " 
Sadly , I'm getting used to living alone . It must help that my meds are well balanced or I'd be losing it . If only I wasn't so sick . It's hard to keep up with housework and many many cats when you're so weak . I struggle just to get all the groceries in 
Really sick today but I finally managed to eat something about an hour ago . Woo-hoo . Tomorrow I have a consult with my GI doc . Hope to get some answers . 
< PROPFIRST > is on his way home RIGHT NOW ! 
These facebook quizzes are driving me nuts . They're all written by illiterate 13 year olds ! If I see \YOUR\ " when it should be \ " YOU'RE\ " one more time I'm going to SNAP ! " 
misses her sisters .... 
I love my baby cats , yes I do , I love my baby cats so should you ! 
I'm watching 48hours . I'm so sick of Muslim countries . The way they treat women is deplorable . Anyone who says \Islam is a religion of peace\ " is full of *&#^" 
I haven't been saying much about it but I'm quite sick . I have an appointment with a Neurologist this month and an EGD scheduled for the 21st . That's where they stick a camera down your throat and all the way into your intestines . 
I'm lonely . I haven't seen < PROPFIRST > in two weeks and I won't see him for another two weeks . Which means he'll be missing my birthday ... again . 
I have 5 kitties in bed with me right now ! It's a good thing it's a < PROPMALE > sized bed . But with < PROPFIRST > not here , I'll manage to find somewhere to sleep ! 
Depressed . Only my husband and sister in law said happy birthday . 
< PROPFIRST>'s on his way home ! 
OMG the cats have given me fleas ! Well not me really , the bed . And I'm in the bed so one just crawled on me ! We just changed the sheets today because of this . But we didn't have time to give the cats their flea med yet ! ARG !!!! 
Isn't it amazing how much time you can lose on youtube watching music videos ? They just suggest one after another ! 
< PROPFIRST>'s driving all night to be with me for my medical procedure at 10am . Love you baby ! 
It's nice to sleep next to my husband again .... 
Fighting some rather large inner demons right now . Maybe I should start drinking . 
It used to be Xanax , but now Vicodin's my best friend .... 
Just finished \City of Glass\ " by < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > . Awesome . It's the third in what will be a four book series . Check it out ! " 
Looking into 12 month Masters of Teaching online program from USC . 
I talked to my < PROPMALE > brother today ! We haven't talked in years . I feel like a missing piece of me has been found . 
Got home about an hour ago from a Wallflowers concert in Nashville . First time I've seen them since I left CA 5 years ago . It was nice to be back home , if only for a night . Standing room only though so I'm so sore from standing from 6:30 pm-11pm , not to mention the jumping around , dancing and singing . A great workout . And I made the mistake of wearing brand new sandles ( not broken in ) , cause they were cute . Ouch ! 
USC wants $ 39,000 for a one year online program ! I'm thinking of looking into just commuting to Vanderbilt . 
Exactly 1 month from today will be me and < PROPFIRST>'s 5 year marriage anniversary ! Any ideas for how to celebrate or what gifts I should get him ?? Oh and girls , feel free to help < PROPFIRST > out , he admits he's lousy with gifts ! I keep telling him , it's HARD to go wrong with jewelry .... ;-) 
Killer migraine . Any tips ? 
My Anti-Suicide Note I'm feeling awful so I just took a bunch of meds and I don't know if they'll interact and kill me . So just in case something happens , tell the police it was an accident ! Even though today was one of the worst days of my life . 
... Just breathe .... 
I've been avoiding this post , but I feel I need to stop putting it off . Last Friday the mobile Vet came to my house and checked on three of my cats . One just needed a shot and some ear drops . The other was pregnant . He said he felt at least four babies in her and she would be due soon . The last was my cat , Blue . The vet told me that he was 17-18 years old ( more in comments section I'm out of room here ) 
My husband's post : < PROPFIRST > Kemp wants everyone to remember what they felt when the Towers fell . Remember the anger . Remember the motivation . Remember the hate . Taste it . Feel the heart pulse faster . < PROPFEMALE > onto it . Never forgive . Never forget . 
Ok , I really need to go to bed . I have an early ( and according to my dad , painful ) procedure at the neurologists office tomorrow . Why won't the Xanax kick in ??? I took one milligram , is it safe to take another half ?? Anyone ?? 
Waiting for the results of my MRI . When vicodin and soma don't do it , you know there's a problem ! 
5 years ago today I ran off and married my husband . While we've been apart for more than half of our marriage ( even now we are forced to live in different states ) I'd still say \I do\ " all over again . 5 years . Take that to all my college friends that thought I was crazy to run off with a soldier I met on the internet ! LOL And thanks to my friends for never saying it to my face ! heheheh " 
Loved talking to my little bro < PROPMALE > . He keeps me company on long lonely nights while < PROPFIRST > is away . We spent at least an hour laughing at www.peopleofwalmart.com 
Remind me to never give kittens cake ! They're ripping my bedroom apart , the little terrorists ! 
I just finished all 9 books of the Sookie Stackhouse series ( from which the show TruBlood was derived ) . I read them all in less than two weeks , they're positively addictive ! 
Just wateched the first season of TrueBlood a couple of times . Damn , Vampire < PROPMALE > , \I want to do real bad things with you ! \ " ( That's a line from the theme song ) " 
I finally did it . I bought an iPhone . I LOVE it . Thank you to < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > for the advice . I'm too young to be afraid of technology !! 
Quote from < PROPFIRST > upon seeing the lastest photos on www.peopleofwalmart.com \I just want to know when I'm supposed to stop carrying a sign that says ' The End Is Coming ' and get a sign that says ' The End Is HERE'\ "" 
Important question of the day ( ... er ... night ): How much Nyquil is too much Nyquil ? 
Since our families are on opposite sides of the country and we don't have any kids , < PROPFIRST > and I are spending Christmas night at a comedy club in Nashville . Ralphie May is doing a special Christmas show and we're stoked ! Will post pics later . 
FYI : If you didn't recieve a Christmas card from < PROPFIRST > and I , don't think we don't love you . We just didn't feel up to doing them this year . Consider yourself loved . lol 
I WILL BE COMPLETELY HONEST FOR 24 HRS . You can ask me one question ( INBOX ONLY ) . Any question , no matter how crazy , sinister , or wrong it is . I WILL answer it no matter what . You have my FULL honesty , but I DARE you to put this as your status and see what questions you get . 
My name according to urbandictionary.com < PROPFEMALE > : Smexy Purely perfect Gorgeous Hot Lovely Just generally amazing And has a great bod A great girlfriend A girl's name . Most girls named < PROPFEMALE > are gorgeous , clever , friendly , lovely , generous , kind , have a good sense of humor , are quite spontaneous and make the perfect girlfriend . Who comes up with this crap ? Is anyone allowed to post their own definitions ? 
All of the talking cat & dog videos by this guy ate amazing ! He should be a professional . http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bTbAsmPOKo&feature=youtube_gdata 
My little hometown is famous ! But for all the wrong reasons . I don't watch the news but < PROPFIRST > said this was the lead story on Fox News last week . http://articles.latimes.com/2010/mar/18/local/la-me-hemet-brown19-2010mar19 
If you like \Dirty Jobs\ " on the Discovery Channel 
Woken up @ 2:30 am by 5 gunshots in quick succession , then the sound of a truck or < PROPFIRST > engine . < PROPFIRST > is in Louisiana so I jumped out of bed & grabbed my Webley revolver . Called < PROPFIRST > to make sure it wasn't hunting season . Then called 911 & they agreed to send a Sheriff around the neighborhood . You just don't get drive-bys in the TN countryside . I called < PROPMALE > & told him it felt like I was ' home ' in CA . 
Happy 5 year anniversary to my husband , < PROPFIRST > !! 
There is not enough Xanax in the world to make up for what apple's new operating system did to my iPhone . \ 
\ 
I am officially a PC now . 
Cracked.com's top suggestion to improve your iphone's reception :\ 
Break into Apple HQ , start shaking random Apple employees until they smarten up- \ 
This may be illegal , and the scientific literature reports inconclusive findings on whether intense agitation can increase intelligence . So bearing that in mind , we can only cautiously recommend this , and then only as a part of a regular fitness regime . 
Gremlin just gave me a bath ; I'm going to need skin grafts now . 
It's not so much that I'm still suffering from culture shock after living in the South for almost six years ; it's just that the way some things are done around here aren't quite second nature to me . California isn't just a state , it's a lifestyle/mindset . \ 
For the sake of those I come into contact with I guess I just need to wear a shirt that says \I'm from California ... that should explain a lot \"" 
The reception my iPhone gets @ my house is so bad that I finally got a landline & a cordless phone . \ 
I've been using a cell exclusively for so many years that I've forgotten how to use a cordless landline !! \ 
My , how far we've come ! 
Thanks for all the birthday wishes , everyone ! 
If you're an animal lover , please read my comment to this post ; it won't fit here . 
If anyone received an email or text from me inviting them to Super Poke Pets , I DIDN'T SEND IT ! I just received an mms . From myself . I have no idea how that happened . So if you got one , SORRY !! I did not purposely spam you !

Really enjoying the film \Shooter . \ " I forgot just how good it is ! " 
Saw the only living Medal of Honor recipient from the Global War on Terror on \The Colbert Report . \ " \ 
Apparently it's drive like an a-hole day in Nashville . I must have missed the email . 
Just curious . I know this has been asked a million times , but if you could have lunch with ANY LIVING person , whom would it be ? 
Stolen from a friend :\ 
How much cocaine did < PROPFIRST > Sheen do ? \ 
Enough to kill two and half men ... ( LOL ! )
