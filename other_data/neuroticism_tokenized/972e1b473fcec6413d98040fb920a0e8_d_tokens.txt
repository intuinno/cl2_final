Belief is truth held in the mind ; faith is a fire in the heart 
LIFE IS A THEATER So Invite Your Audience ... Carefully CaUsE Not everyone is healthy enough to have a front row seat in our lives . 
This week I'm learning how to be more dependable . ^__^ 
It’s funny how < PROPFEMALE > has the “ one-child policy” yet every year there are over one- million births than there are deaths . I understand the fact that the country is over populated , but there are other solutions to this conflicting issue . :-/

Life’s Riches When we count our many blessings ; It isn't hard to see That life's most valued treasures Are the treasures that are free . For it isn't what we own or buy That signifies our wealth . It's the special gifts that have no price : Our family , friends and health . \Happy Thanksgiving everyone\ " ^_^ " 
It's official ... I'm going back to natural , no more long visits to the salon !! ^_^ 
To be closemouthed like a tied-up sack is neither blameworthy nor praiseworthy .

3 finals down , & 3 more to go ... about to head to the libary till midnight . ^_^ 
Women are like apples on trees , the best ones are on the top of the tree . The men don't want to reach for the good ones because they are afraid of falling and don't want to get hurt . Instead , they just get the rotten apples from the ground that aren't so good but easy . So , the apples at the top think something is wrong with them , when in reality they are amazing .

The success or failure of any historical age is the extent to which those living at that time have fulfilled the special role that history has imposed upon them . \ 
--- THE GREAT WORK 
Old Thought : I’m just a drop in the bucket . My effort might make me feel better , but it can’t do much . \ 
New Thought : Every time we act , even with our fear , we make room for others to do the same . Courage is contagious . \

Whatever you want to do , just do it . Making a damn fool of yourself is absolutely essential . 
I really don't like being sick ... especially on a beautiful day like to day :-(( 
I like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past .
