Had a great weekend . Kell and the g-kids came by for dinner and wound up spending the night ( Yeah ! )Watched a couple movies , spend this morning helping kel with getting her facebook launched ! She lost a dear friend recently , I feel for her as I know how it feels . People are dying younger these days-makes us all think of our own mortality and how any second could be our last in this world .

A true friend can go long periods of time without speaking and never question their friendship . REPOST if you are lucky enough to have at least one true friend . 
So happy to wake up and NOT see snow today !!!!
