still feeling under the weather after being in a car accident , but blessed as no one really got hurt in either vehicle 
Fires are breaking out all over and wreaking havaoc on friends and familys and they really need our prayers along with all the other people tahe are caught up in all the fires through the states and the world especally those who are trying to save human lives and those who are trying to keep their homes safe 
a friend of ours .. her sister just lost her home in the fire 
well the weather here has been our normal rain for this time of the year EXCEPT for the extremely high winds . we had a gust of 42 mph this am . the wind has been holding steadily around 18-22 mph last night and today so far . so if we are not on later you will have an idea as to why . this storm system is supposed to let up sometime tomorrow morning . hopefully .

HAPPY BIRTHDAY < PROPFEMALE > !!!! i LOVE YOU !!! 
I need more zoo world gifts especally animals or trees thank you 
YES !!! AARONS TESTS ARE NORMAL !!!!! 
I actually do read each one of my posts ... Never doubt that I care for you greatly . I am not only glad to count you as family , but also glad to count you as friend .... I care for all of you !!! Let's see who in my Friend's List actually pays attention . Copy and repost this in your own bulletin . Lets see who the true ............ friend's are !!! 
for all those blessings that you get from others for sneezing really do count . as we found out this past weekend both for family on Hawaii and here at home on the oregon coast . we were on way to an DR\S appt in medford for < PROPFIRST > when we received a voice mail about the tsunami from family . " 
The devastationial effect it had on us mentally well could not be described as we was worried as we also live in the tsunami zone and mom was staying home to watch the animals and then family on Hawaii . what were we going to do . the only thing we could do was let GOD take over and pray pray pray . 
And on top of all this the < PROPFIRST > was starting to give us trouble . to make a short story shorter we have found someone to work on the < PROPFIRST > abut we had to stay over night . they worked on a the < PROPFIRST > and could not get parts till Monday . what to do no vehicle to get the family back home over 35 hrs away . the owner new of a tow company that would be able to sell us a car that would make it back to the coast . 
3.5 hrs away supposed to be not 35 
the tow truck company owner did come and took me back to his lost , but everything was too expensive or just would not make it . he brought me back and he called a few of his contacts none was there at their phones . so he was not going to leave us there and he said we could borrow his car . and then said \ what is a Christian supposed to do . \ " so we made it back home safe and sound " 
he also told us to keep the car until the < PROPFIRST > is fixed . the < PROPFIRST > is being fixed by a family that has a shop that was giving up their days off to work on the < PROPFIRST > to get it fixed and done properly for us . so all those \blessings\ " you get for everytime you sneeze really do count . you can never be with out to many blessingsso dont forget to hand them back out also . and praise the LORD in the highest !!!! " 
you will have to go to my home < PROPFEMALE > and read down to were this story starts 
People need to understand that special needs children don't have an illness , they are not looking for a cure only acceptance . 93% of you probably won't copy and paste this ~ will you be in the 7% that will and leave it on your status for at least an hour . Special Education week March 22nd to the 26th . Go on copy and paste 
well at least we know that < PROPFIRST > , mommy and daddy did not catch this nasty virus from FB lol . both < PROPFIRST > and daddy have a dry nasty cough and mommy has a full blown cold it seems to aapear . meanwhile < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > are all ok for the moment . so as to say watch what u get into as we don't know were we caught this on our last trip to portland . 
remember this passage as its my favorite < PROPFIRST > 15:13 Greater love has no one than this , that he lay down his life for his friends . you see Jesus is my friend he will always be there for me and if you look around he is there for others too !! so next time you see one trying to save a life think of Jesus saving ours !! 
This is the time we should remember that Jesus gave his life so we can follow and be like him . What makes it special that you can see the brotherly love that he has given us for one another .. We should love each other with Brotherly affection and take delight in honoring each otherdo not Pretend to love other : really love them !! 
HE IS ALIVE !!!! JESUS IS ALIVE !!!! 
HAPPY EASTER EVERONE !!!! HE LIVES !!!!! 
This is Holy Week ... I am out to prove that my friends will repost this , I hope I am right !! Let's lift up HIS name and make a statement !! When JESUS died on the cross , He died for YOU and ME . If you are not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ , copy and repost . I am not ashamed !!

A true friend doesn't care if your house is untidy , your car makes funny noises , or that your family is not perfect . They love you for who you are . A true friend can go long periods of time without speaking and never question their friendship . REPOST if you are blessed with at least one true friend
