I beat < PROPFIRST > in our Pokemon battle . It was rather easy . 

Has anyone done the bio project thing for Moreno ( and murales , if you guys got it) ? I kind of want to know how long it'll take me to do . 
I should go to sleep . But I don't want to . :/ 
I hate Wednesdays . 
I successfully tricked < PROPFIRST > into making his picks for the NCAA tournament . Although , he just picked the higher seed for every round . :/ 
Dentist appointment today . -_- 
My teeth were apparently \beautiful\ " . I feel like a god . They've NEVER said that about my teeth before . "

Booby and I lost in the quarter finals to the defending 5A state champs . And we actually gave them a good match ( would've been closer if not for losing 3 straight deuce games ) . \ 
... It was a seriously crazy day , though . Mutated walruses , schizophrenia , and 5 year olds telling me to f off . 
Can anyone in my Spanish class tell me what we did Friday ? I know we took a vocab quiz , but I'm not sure what else . 
Uhm , what were the bio notes we took for Moreno Friday ? They're not on her site , and I don't trust the calender . 
Oh my god , < PROPFEMALE > Nguyen is right . I do look like a Jedi when I swing my backhand . 0.0 
Has anyone done the bio prelab ? I'm trying to eyeball it from the book , but it just doesn't make sense ... :/

About to be stuck in a car with < PROPFIRST > Blanchard for three to four hours straight ... Hopefully I'll come out mostly intact . 
Almost home from < PROPFIRST > ! Still not a huge fan , though .
