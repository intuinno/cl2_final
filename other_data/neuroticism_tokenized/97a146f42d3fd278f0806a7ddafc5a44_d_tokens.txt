Just got back from a family camping trip this weekend . I tried to turn the TV on when I got home , it didn't work . I was holding the wrong remote for two whole minutes wondering whats wrong . I have been outdoors WAY TOO LONG .

I can't believe I slept for 12 hours straight yesterday ! 
High School Exit Exam .... got a perfect score on the math section .... doesn't this tell you something .... ITS A JOKE ! lol .... 
If you can keep your head in a situation when other people are losing\ 
theirs , you probably don't understand the situation . 
I read something today ...... never be afraid to try something new . Remember , amateurs built the ark , professionals built the Titanic . ( It took me a whole second for the realization to kick in ) .... 
Helped my neice with her hw today ... made a collage . It was so hard and I don't know why ! She is only in 6th grade ! Then I discovered I spent my sunday doing hw . Great ..... 
Saw Vampire Sucks today , a few funny moments but I just don't like parodys . But hey , seeing team < PROPMALE > vs . team < PROPFIRST > fighting was worth it . Especially the ending ... sadly to say , it made my day . 
Working on Laverty's essay ..... damn ... there's a test , essay , and a hw assignment due the same day . That's only for one class . What's wrong with this picture ? 
Today my sister , mom and I went to run some errands . We got home all tired and discovered a black hole in the back patio . Turns out my dad almost burned down the house ..... * sigh * oh dad , what are we going to do with you ? * Rolling my eyes * 
Oh rain , you make me want to cuddle under my blanket and procrastinate on homework . Oh wait , I do that anyways ..... -_- 
Does any one know what is Laverty's hw this weekend ? And no , please don't mention the < PROPFEMALE > essay , I am doing it on Monday night like everyone else . And yes Mr. Laverty , I just wrote two sentences with the word ' and ' as a beginner . Hmph . 
I already thought of a thesis , planned out all the body paragraphs , and knew what to put in the conclusion . It was a good day until I took out a piece of paper and held up my pencil . Crap , I offically HATE introductions . 
I hate the feeling of staying up late to finish hw when you < PROPFEMALE > sleep , then on days when you can sleep you < PROPFEMALE > to stay up late ....... * sigh *

killed in Hogwarts when it was under siege by the Death Eaters during \ 
The Second Wizarding War . The Order brings unity , but the Death Eaters \

Repost this if you support Dumbledore's Army . 
My parents and I went to the market . Turns out my dad forgot the keys in the car and we got locked out . He got mad because of this . Then my mom got mad not because my dad got us locked out but because he was mad at something so stupid . I swear , if I wasn't their to block them from fighting the ambulance would've helped us get home instead of the locksmith . God , this is why i don't spend the ENTIRE day with my folks . 
So sad , break is OVER . OVER ! The agony for having to go to school for another 3 weeks . * sigh *
