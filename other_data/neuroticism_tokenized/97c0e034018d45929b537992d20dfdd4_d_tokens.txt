Just waking up after 2 hours sleep , only to find out , what feels like a horrible dream , is actually my insane reality ..... crushed and devastated , trying to hold my head up . 
Another day down and < PROPFIRST > is still holding on strong . He needs a miracle and I am hoping there is one somewhere out there for him . 
Miracles aren't so easy to come by are they ? 
What the hell is up with farmtown on my computer ...... lol 
In such a horrible mood ..... I don't see it changing anytime soon either .

I miss my Mom , I could sure use her advice right about now . Only she would have the answers I need . You would think after almost 15 years I would be used to not having her , but I will never get used to not having my Mom to tell me what's good . She always knew what to say .. I HATE being an orphan . 
I LOVE when people think I am stupid , and think they can pull one over on me , it is very entertaining , still pisses me off , but also funny at the same time . < PROPFEMALE > is always a bitch , and every dog has their day . I WILL get the last laugh in the end . I always do .
