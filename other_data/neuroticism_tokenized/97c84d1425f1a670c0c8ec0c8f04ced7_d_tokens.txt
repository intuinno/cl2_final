here's to the shit we tlk , the boys we stalk , to running frm the cop , the laughs tht cnt stop , the gossip we spill , the looks tht can kill . to having eachothers back , the nxt morning gathering facts , downing the beers , spilling the tears . to running pong , to staying out all night long- cheeeers ! you're my best friend mstock !

kidnapped , call the po and blame < PROPFEMALE > ! ! M$o : ^* ; 
live to love , love to live 
a man falls in love through his eyes , a woman through her ears 
dont tell me im always right , im not . dont let me win every fight . when i cry play w my hair and keep your promise if you say youll always be here . 
i think men are afraid to be with a successful woman , because we are terribly strong , we know what we want and we are not fragile enough 
shes the type of girl who smiles even when shes crying , who stays strong through it all . 
theres no such thing as good girls gone wrong , only bad girls found out ;) 
i keep waiting to find a boy who has more balls than i do 
eventually you snap and say the things you've been holding back , meaner than you ever intended to . fml . 
ill nvr be the perfect girl- the one who doesn't spill something on her white shirt , who always holds her tongue , who \let's it go\ " and doesn't tlk in circles ... that just isn't me " 
when you smile , the whole world stops and stars for a while 
sick of being a boring bradenton boy ? we have just the thing for you ! personality ! sold for as little as $3 in a can , also referred to as four loko ! now you can be confident while you creep on the girl whos obviously not interested ! ....... just why

looking at you it occurred to me , i could sit down all day wearing nothing but your kiss . you make mirrors want to grind themselves back down into sand because they can't do your reflection justice <3

looking forward to sleeping forever after work <3 
please get me the fuck out of this house and shit town . 
it's raining men , hallelujah ! 
thunderstorms = bein lulled to sleep like a baby 
dear manatee county students : since our principals and other important figures don't close school when there are tornados wrecking havoc all over the place , i suggest just this once skipping last period bc driving in this weather is going to be a disaster in itself . call me the weather woman .

note to self : avoid all clothing stores online or you will plan your entire next paycheck around shopping 
people change and so do feelings . 
its just me and this shoreline , you've sailed so far away 
i know entirely too many beautiful people who never are truly appreciated for all that they do for others . that disgusts me and is extremely depressing .

watching the butterfly effect w < PROPFEMALE > for the first time ever 
letting go doesn't mean giving up , but rather accepting that there are things that simply cannot be 
hurt me once , shame on you- hurt me twice , shame on me . 
be who you are and say how you feel because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind . 
eye wuvzzz brand-eeeee 
you don't get to choose when or who you meet , but you do get to choose who you hold on to 
I am absolutely imperfect and I love it 
girls don't like boys girls like cars and money 
if you obey all the rules , youll miss out on all the fun 
it's like i have ESPN or something , my breasts can always tell when it's going to rain ... well , they can tell WHEN it's raining 
the real < PROPMALE > of conversation is not only to say the right thing at the right time , but also to leave unsaid the wrong thing at the tempting moment 
i want to get away , i want to fly awayyy , yeahhhhhhhyeahhhhyeahhhh 
to love in spite of all is the secret of greatness . and may very well be the greatest secret in this universe . 
i hopped up outta bed and turned on my swag , no big deal 
i must be running on sunshine , ain't no rain gettin ' in my way 
the history books forgot about us and the bible didn't mention us , not even once 
you seem to have a lot to say after being the one to push me awayyyyyYyYy 
dont fear the unknown , embrace it 
fall seven times , get back up eight <3 
iiiii may be bad but im perfectly good at it ; b 
there's only one thing young ladies should be inserting in themselves and that's knowledge . 
we all have scars and stories 
if you think it's necessary to judge me by my past , don't get mad when i put you there 
i guess slutty is in season ? 
never love somebody who treats you like you're ordinary , love the person who sees that you're extraordinary <3 
if i had a face like yours .... i would punch it 
i'd call you a tool ..... but , then you'd have to serve some sort of purpose .. 
if you wanna be my lover , you gotta get with my friends : b <3

i'd be lying if i said i didn't love FGCU more than i ever imagined :) 
everyone walks around with their heads down instead of looking up and seeing how beautiful the sky is 
you stumble upon the most wonderful things when you stop searching for them :) 
I wanna love you and treat you right , I wanna love you every day and every night 
and im free , free fallin <3

you're not popular but your vagina is 
count your blessings , not your problems 
entirely too many jealous people in the world trying to drag everyone down ! i'm too busy for that nonsense , all smiles over here ! 
i may not be proud of some of the things i've done in my past , but i sure as hell am proud of who i am today . 
\i wish school was half as easy as the girls in it .... \"" 
never think just saying you love someone is enough , love is a verb and it means nothing without action . 
does anyone want a free < PROPFEMALE > named samson ? he's the shit but my sister can't keep him at her new apartment :/ so he's free and really pretty . hit me up ! 
watching inception with my bayyyyybeeee : * <3 < PROPFIRST > Hayes you da best ! 
when i was little and my parents put me to bed , i'd throw temper tantrums . now when people drag me OUT of bed , i throw temper tantrums . go figure . 
13 days until i leave the place i've called home my entire life for FGCU . mind blown . 
When you start to know someone , all their physical characteristics start to disappear . You begin to dwell in their energy , recognize the scent of their skin . You see only the essence of the person , not the shell . Thatís why you canít fall in love with beauty . You can lust after it , be infatuated by it , want to own it . You can love it with your eyes and your body but not your heart .
