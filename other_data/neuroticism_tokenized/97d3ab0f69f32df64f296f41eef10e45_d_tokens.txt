Got over 10 hours of sleep ... Let's hope I still don't fall asleep during school ... ( : ? 
Due to listening and singing to Christmas songs , I now have a craving for gingerbread cookies ... :3 
So . I just remembered . I saw a silver beatle driving down the road during class . I glanced out again to check if it was still there . I stared at someone for a while and punched them . Really hard . Smiled , then sat back down . Highlight of my day . 
XD leet speak . FTW . 
I'm actually happy I went to school today . Surprised I survived without sleeping in class with at least 2 hours of sleep . Like , WHOA . XD 
I enjoy lies and broken promises . 
Just waiting for a miracle . 
Started making peanutbutter cookies . I just realized we have no flour . 
peanut butter and fail cookies = hahahahaohgod . 
I like how you won't try fixing this problem you caused . This is really reassuring . 
I can't believe this anymore . This is becoming a little old . 
Oshit . 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Brown ! You whore ! Stop liking my stuff ! D: 
Culver's root beer makes me hiccup . 
Where's the snow when you've got the chill ?

Just talked to my grandma who's in the Philippines . I miss her so much . 
I love my cousin . :D

\Our hearts are heavy burdens we shouldn't have to bear alone ... \ " <3 "

Watching Jaws with the little brother . I think I'm more terrified than he is . How sad . Haha .

Tomorrow should be interesting . Awesome . 
three people going through a door is fun (: \ 
but probably more painful when you're the ones not in the middle , so , your shoulder and side is basically raping the door frame . except . being squished in between two people who are basically a foot taller than you isn't as nice either . ahem . < PROPFIRST > Smithson and < PROPMALE > Gutke . pahahaha . 
I wish I had a penguin . :3 
Bowling with the cousins (: I wish that something like from Across the Universe would happen ; jumping over lanes and breaking out into song . :D
