I am happy about the return of < PROPFIRST > from < PROPFEMALE > . 

I am glad that tomorrow is another day . ( I don't want to repeat this one . ) 
Had a good wokout , hope to have a good night's rest . 
Just had a nice swim . Still warm outside . 
Looking forward to a good night's sleep . 
She-Crab soup tonight ! 
I just had lunch at Lo Lo's . I am full . 
Doing Christmas cards at the Kitchen Table , fire in the fireplace , carols playing , missing snow . 
Still recovering from two NYE parties ! 
This morning I am spending time on Linkedin and polishing my resume . It could be a long road to my next position , but , even the longest journey begins with the first step . 
I am wearing the green . 
I just listened to the radio : Dems need two more Reps to change from no to yes by Sat . night . Very very close vote on healthcare . 
What a beautyful day today . 
Lunch today with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > . 
I wonder if I will keep my composure when I plead for my life before a government death panel . And , if I get to serve on a death panel , after the old lady pleads for her life , I will extend my arm out like Caesar and give her the thumps up or I will give her the thumps down . What a thrill !!! 
I am off to ASU to discuss possible summer international internships with my ASU < PROPMALE > . 
A friend of mine is a teacher and is getting a hard time from her principle . It is all politics . Don't you wish public school was less political ? Wouldn't it be better for the country ?

We had a garage sale this morning . We sold one bike and one gas can . Big Bust !!! 
I had a nice Easter yesterday . 
I am just getting over the earthquake . Chandeliers swaying was spooky . Of course , when it happened , I took precautions - I was the first one under the bed . 
I learned that I missed two good opportunities today . Darn ! Accepting things that I cannot change is not my strong point . Was it OHara who said : \Tomorrow is another day ? \"" 
Tomorrow we ignor the lessons that we learned from our last failed garage sale and do the same thingsall over again expecting a different outcome . I will keep you all up to date on our success . 
My Aunt passed away yesterday , I just got the news and I am sad here at home . I will attend the funeral later this week . 
< PROPFEMALE > and I have arrived in Palos Verdes , California . Wake is in one hour . 
My motherboard is dead !!! Tomorrow I will work at the library . 
Today is a lovely day . 
Today was a nice day . Tomorrow , Mother's Day . 
Today was a nice mother's day , with < PROPFEMALE > preparing a wonderful meal for everyone ! ( And she helped me pick out a present that her mom liked . ) 
I saw Iron Man II yesterday at the I < PROPMALE > . The extra $ for the I < PROPMALE > version was not worth it . See it on a regular screen . [ Although seeing secret agent < PROPFEMALE > Johansson on a four story high screen was not so bad . ] 
I saw < PROPFIRST > Hood at the Cine Capri yesterday . I found it enjoyable , but < PROPFIRST > found it too violent . Also , there was no chemistry between < PROPFIRST > and a rather unglamorous Lady < PROPFIRST > . Cate Blanchett was miscast . < PROPFEMALE > Beckinsale would have been a lot better . 
According to the paper , based on the deal brokered yesterday , by about November , Iran will have a Nuke and a missile to deliver it anywhere in the middle east . Will this mean war , or will < PROPMALE > and the US ignore Iran's bombs ? ( Last week Congress gave < PROPMALE > $200 million to quickly deploy its new anti - missile system . ) 
Tipper and < PROPMALE > . I did not see it coming . Remember when he was a Senator she took up as her cause , the effort to have musical recordings rated just like the movies to guide parents in purchasing music for kids ? When he got the nomination for VP , he forced her to state that she was no longer involved in that effort before attending a fundraiser in Hollywood . Maybe she want's to be free to hold her own opinions . 
For Father's Day , my family is taking me to a DBack-Yankee game . I am very grateful ! 
Saturday the weather was great , < PROPFEMALE > and 78 degrees , no humidity . < PROPFIRST > and I put the top down and drove up to the lake and spent a fine time at the beech , the lake water was warm and it was very relaxing . Nature can be refreshing ( well , the lake is man-made , but \inmproved nature\ " can still be refreshing ! ) " 
Age Discrimination ? \

Saw Brophy game last night . Kickoff\ 
temp : 108 . Temp at the final whistle : 102 . Brophy built up a 19-0\ 
lead in the first half . In the second half , the heat got everybody . \ 
Some players fell down after running a while without being hit . \ 
Passes dropped , passes under thrown , awful . Heat was too much ! Final\ 
score Brophy 19 , < PROPMALE > High 6 . I have never witnessed football in\ 
such heat . 
Cezanne in the morning , treadmill in the afternoon . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > Kane will be married on August 27 , 2011 . 
Spent our wedding anniversary last Sunday up on Mt . Mount Humphreys above 8 thousand feet . Too cold to hike to 12,000 ) It is great to go to the mountaintop on a special day . ( 23 years ) 
< PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > and I had a nice day today . \ 
Next they are going wedding dress shopping but I won't go . I have watched too many episodes of \Say Yes To The Dress\ " already !!! " 
1 . Puppy gets up at 5:30 am . 2 . Take puppy out to back yard in dark . 3 . Puppy jumps on me , knocking cell into pool . 4 . Dive in pool ( cold ) , retrieve cell . 5 . Cell still dead , puppy still happy . 
Wedding Dress purchased by < PROPFEMALE > on Saturday . All attendees/critics/friends satisfied with choice . 
Held the door open to Barnes & < PROPMALE > for a mom and 2 kids to pass through ahead of me . The 5 year old looked me in the eye and said : \Please don't steal me . \ " \ 
< PROPFEMALE > has had my 6mo old pc for 10 days . Just got a robot call saying the repair is not covered . Called 4 times and was dropped by < PROPFEMALE > . AhHHHH ! 
I hate when the news does not give you the whole story . Today a fatwa came from Yemen saying it is OK to kill an American anytime , anywhere , and in any manner . But , the story failed to say what level of ID is acceptable . Must the victim have a picture ID , or is a library card OK ? Is an accent enough ? It would be helpful to usto know these things before planing our next trips to Yemen and Somalia . 
PC is back ! Life begins again . 
< PROPFIRST>'s in the kitchen cooking for Thursday already . I have to go to purchase some apples . 
Is off to the bookstore to buy \Rethinking the Brain . \ " He has to read this book before his senility kicks in . " 
Big Rain today ! 
< PROPFEMALE > & nice today ! 
Tomorrow is another day . 
“There are no second acts in American lives” 
< PROPFEMALE > + 75 ! Nice . 
I know what you mean . I can't stand it when strange women come up to me and say how attractive I am - I mean I didn't do anything to earn my good looks - Looks are just a gift from Providence . Like you , I wish that all of the women would just say it behind my back . 
Can't win with < PROPFIRST > C . You Bears . 
Shared lunch with an old friend - the best kind . 
Just walked past a coyote sitting outside the supermarket door . 
It is raining softly , but the sun is shining . What a strange afternoon . 
To the people of Egypt , what does Democracy mean ? 
< PROPFEMALE > and beautiful afternoon . Nice day for a drive with the top down
