Why do people insist on telling the people I dont want in my life my business ? If I tell you something even here , it stays here . I block individuals for a reason .

Now is the time to renew\ 
Rip through mountains with your blade\ 
This is your lethal rite to parade\ 
Through the walls that you crash\ 
Infernal barriers turn to ash\ 
Stronger resolve removes the fear\ 
This is what I see is clear 
Omg . Im so nervous , and Istill got 2 weeks ....

Let loose the insanity unto the world , \ 
Watch the wings of the demon unfurl , \ 
Defiantly stand firm with fists curled , \ 
The clouds of chaos violently swirl .
