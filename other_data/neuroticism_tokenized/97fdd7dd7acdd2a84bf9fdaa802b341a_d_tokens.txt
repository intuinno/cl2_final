Reputation down - stop breakin ' down ! - White Stripes , epic 
But you can’t stop nothing if you got no control Of the thoughts in your mind that you kept and you know That you don’t know nothing but you don’t need to know The wisdom’s in the trees not the glass windows You can’t stop wishing if you don’t let go \ 
Of the things that you find and you lose and you know You keep on rolling , put the moment on hold Because the frame’s too bright , so put the blinds down low

It's domination pushed into living hell\ 
Domination a now blacked heart\ 
Is reaching out divinity\ 
Body suspended by chains over razors\ 
And nails it's a penalty\ 
Each razor a vice and each nail\ 
Marks the demise of your life . \ 
Grim construction grows\ 
Has life played a trick\ 
Sealed you in brick by brick\ 
Till your end forcing you to bend 
how is your full < PROPFEMALE > ????
