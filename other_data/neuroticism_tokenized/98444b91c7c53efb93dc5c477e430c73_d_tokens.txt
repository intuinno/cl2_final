Aggravated ! Really aggravated ! Long day at work ... someone always forgets to tell you the important things !

Whatever ! I guess everyone eventually shows their true colors ! It sucks but you cant stop the inevitable ! 
How many times can you really give someone a < PROPMALE > ...! 
I tell ya ... when it rains it sure does pour ! 
FACEBOOK TRICK : press up , up , down , down , left , right , left , right , B , A , Enter key , then right click then press up and down and magic circles will appear . Put this as your status if it works . after you follow all the steps scroll up or down ... then the circles will appear . The only way to get rid of them are to log off or refresh the < PROPFEMALE > 
Going with my heart ! Staying strong ! I guess you just think in time this will all go away ... you thought wrong ! 
Can't wait for tomorrow ! < PROPFEMALE>'s first Thanksgiving !! :) 
OMG we finally arrived to Illinois , what would have taken us 12 hours took us 22 because of the weather in MD and PA ... FML ! Next time im flying ! Mom , < PROPFIRST > and Leif ... hope you have fun on your cruise , and < PROPFEMALE > christmas ! 
had fun at the baby shower ! great food ! great toys and clothes ! thank you everyone ! :) 
OMG ! so tired ... got all my christmas shopping done today ! 
treating < PROPFEMALE > and myself to applebees for dinner because we deserve it ! new year new me , new way of living my life ! its time to start writing this book the way it should be !! 
I admit it , I'm a bitch !!!! Unfortunately most women won't repost this ... I make mistakes , I'm crazy , occasionally out of control , I'm emotional , and at times I'm hard to handle - but if you can't handle me at my worst you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best ! If you're a bitch repost this ! I dare you !! 
I love my life ! No matter what goes wrong in any given day , when I get home and I see my baby girl ... all my troubles go away ! < PROPFEMALE > had a great first easter ! We are sooo blessed to have such a beautiful ... and good baby ! I would not change my life for the world ... well maybe a few things ... but not my family ! :)) 
waiting to get my tattoo done ! :) 
got my tattoo done ... i love it ! :) 
final clear coat on olivias dresser-check . Spill the clear coat-check ... atleast it wasnt the stain or else i would really be in trouble . Headache- check . Shower- yea im gettin there . Tingling in my arms and legs- check . Goodnights sleep- probably not . 
I may not be the most attractive . I may not be the nicest . I may not have designer clothes . I may not have a degree and I may not make millions . I may lose things and i may break things from time to time . But damnit i try and if you cant see that then shame on you . 
work in 6 hours , < PROPFEMALE > doesnt want to go to sleep . Should be a fantabulous day at work ! 
in order to be succesful in life , you must have goals and work towards them . 
reminiscing about the good ol ' days riding horses with good friends , taking the horses swimming and going on trail rides ! :) those were the best days of my life ! :) 
so as i was going to lunch this piece of styrafoam comes up and hits my car , who the would have known a piece of styrafoam could put a dent in your car ! FML ! 
So we had BK for dinner . We went outside to smoke-Olivia was in her < PROPMALE > inside . We come back in when we are done smoking & she has the BK bag shaking it around ... Fries , Tomatoes & BBQ sauce all over the floor . BBQ sauce all over her face & hands . Fry in her mouth with BBQ sauce on it ! It was hilarious i could not stop laughing ! She begs for our food . She doesnt want just a taste either , she wants all of it ! ROTF LMAO 
DEPRESSION is NOT a sign of weakness ... it is a sign that you have been trying to be strong for too long . Put this as your status if you are someone , or you know someone who has or has had depression . Will you do it and leave it on your status for at least an hour ? Most people won't , but it's mental health week and 1 ... in 3 of us will suffer at some point in our lives . Show your support ! 
Had a good night , telling good stories , with a great friend ! :)) 
happy mothers day ! 
how on earth do you grow seedless watermelons or even grapes ?!? How do they grow without seeds . You have to plant a seed to grow it ... so i just dont understand !!!!!! 
sometimes life puts a wall right infront of you ... all you have to do is climb over it . It may be tough at times and may seem unfair but you just gotta keep on goin ' dont slow down , keep on movin ' you might get out before the devil even knows your there . 
everyone gets so excited about the horse races ... but do you know what brutal training they go through , do you even care that they are beating them with a whip for them to run . Do you know what they do to them if they dont win ?! Most of them get put to sleep . Did you know that thousands of horses die each year because of racing ? Guess you're too selfish to realize all of this , all you're worried about is the money ! 
just finished watching blind side . Really good movie ! :) 
Keep on talking ! Because you know what ?!?! One day it will come back to you ... karma's a bitch !! 
do you think i could join your conversation about me ? K great thanks !
