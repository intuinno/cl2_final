thinks < PROPFEMALE > Goldin is his best discovery since E . S . Posthumus . Go look her up if you're into New Age and fantastic female voices . 
remember those really old commercials for Tang where the kids drank Tang and there was so much citric acid that they went on an acid trip ? And orangutans were surfing on orange waves and riding wrecking balls'n'shit ? the 90s were AWESOME .

went through an ORDEAL moving in to UNO . First , we have trouble finding a parking spot since we somehow made it just in time for the big move-in rush we were trying to avoid . Second , we have to < PROPFEMALE > all our heavy and expensive stuff inside in the rain . Third , once we actually GET inside , the RAs politely inform us that they cannot give us the paperwork for a room key unless we have paid what we owe ... AND THEN -- !

thanks all of you for the birthday wishes back on the 28th . The big 20 ... not long until the big 21 ! ( not that I plan to drink or anything , furrealz )

is feeling hateless , fraughtless , and helpless today . But in my weakness I am strong - trust me on this one . 
is PSYCHED about meeting with < PROPMALE > Hager tomorrow to compose together ! 
It's a 7 day , so let's all feel happy . =) 
http://www.speedyshare.com/files/19377738/Departure_and_Farewell.mp3 New song , nothing spectacular and kind of short but I felt like sharing . 
would like people to check out his new songs . They're not very long and both pretty interesting . :D

So I'm having a fun day and all - pretty sure I did well on a History quiz , all I've got for class tomorrow is chorus , and then the weekend . Cool beans , right ?

Today in World History , we learned about various Eurasian empires of the 16th-18th centuries . My favorite ? The Moogle Empire . That's right , there was once a thriving civilization of Moogles in < PROPFEMALE > . I was astonished to learn this , understandably .

was elated to hear , upon returning to P . Hall , that the water supply was fixed . He was psyched to finally take a hot , relaxing shower . When he arrived at his room , he was horrified to find that while , the COLD water was fine , the HOT water is brown/yellow . Should he bathe in it anyway ? What you YOU do ? 
< PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > were right - after I ran the spout for about 5 minutes the water regained its clarity . On the one hand , it was awful going two mornings without running water ; on the other hand , BEST SHOWER EVER . Or so it seemed . 
Okay , so last night I had a very peculiar dream . It was 10 or 20 years in the future . I explored a little , and learned that there was A , no new technology ; B , no new fashions ; C , no < PROPMALE > cultural changes . I was puzzled by this , and decided there had to be something interesting about this new future . Then I turned on MTV ... It seems that 10 or 20 years later , < PROPFIRST > Swift is still popular . What a nightmare ! 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . 
had a very , very long day . I wake up on the couch having shirked a paper I was supposed to do the previous night ; I shower , pack and go to UNO ; I unload my things in my room and head to Chorus ; I snarfle down a hasty lunch and study for my French exam until it starts ; I rush back to my room to finish the paper I hadn't finished last night ; I dine quickly and hand the paper in at 6 ... 
This is amazing ! Thanks so much for sharing . I'll be sure to play it at length later on . < PROPMALE>'s not very good ... I think Samus and Mega Man are my favorites , maybe Link . They're all really interesting . ( I didn't play as < PROPFIRST > - it would defeat the purpose . )

( GLEE-related status ) Did anybody REALLY think New Directions was going to win Regionals in the first season ? That's not how they do these shows . Maybe in season two they'll win Regionals , and maybe somewhere down the line they'll win nationals . But nobody's hopes and dreams are EVER realized at the end of the first season !

thinks he may be going through Glee withdrawals . He just had a dream in which < PROPFIRST > Mahoney and he were in a high school Glee Club together for no explicable reason . We didn't get to the singing . It was a big deal because Groban and the girl from JUNO ( again , for no real reason because she isn't a singer ) were there . There was ... 
Hooray for the Red , White and Blue ! Happy 4th everybody - 234 years and < PROPFEMALE>'s still going strong ( depending on who you ask ) . :) 
Seeing < PROPMALE > Mis for the SECOND day in a row at SLT , in little over an hour . The YATS have done an excellent job with this show , and I look forward to being blown away all over again in tonight's final performance ( my sister , on the other hand , is looking forward to the lock-in afterwards , as it involves generous amounts of tabletop RP for her and her friends =D ) . 
Loved < PROPMALE > Mis ! I saw it two nights in a row at Slidell Little Theatre . The casting was phenomenal , the chorus was powerful ... well , everything was ! I teared up several times . They couldn't have picked a better man than < PROPMALE > Portier to play < PROPFIRST > Valjean - this guy's range is beyond incredible . So to everyone on my friends list who was in the show : excellent work ! I'll be sure to come see you in whatever else I can . 
is about to go have some oral surgery done - yay ! o_o ; ... It's a stub they're installing in my mouth , where I'm missing a tooth . Months from now , maybe over Thanksgiving or Christmas break , they'll be attaching a false tooth to the stub ; this will mean no more retainer , and I can eat with my fake tooth in , and most importantly I can SING and have a full set of teeth AT THE SAME TIME . So yeah , it'll be worth it .

So , my three favorite acts from the current season of < PROPFEMALE>'s Got Talent - < PROPFIRST > Evancho , < PROPMALE > Poppycock , and Fighting Gravity ( in no particular order ) - made it into the final 4 ! I'm incredibly pleased . Made for a great evening . :) 
Please join me in congratulating my sister < PROPFEMALE > on 19 years of life . I feel privileged to have shared so much of my own time on this earth with < PROPFEMALE > . She's diligent in both studies and creative pursuits , she brings laughter and wide smiles to my face with her sardonic wit and spot-on comedic timing , and those who really know her plainly see she has a strong conscience and a good soul . Love you much , < PROPFEMALE > !

So there were just a crowd of people clapping and shouting and playing \When The Saints Go Marchin ' In\ " on brass outside the dorms . Gotta love the zeal - not that I wasn't fully expecting it . I'm sure it'll only get rowdier as the evening carries on . YAY ! :) "

So my mother and I were figuring out our vocal ranges ( singing ) last night . She can get from a low C to a high C more or less comfortably ; I can get from a low A to a high A comfortably . This means we each have a 3-octave range ; it also means I can hit almost every note she can , only two whole tones behind . \ 
I was pleased to learn this . 8D 
Everyone please keep < PROPFEMALE > Guillot in your prayers or intentions ; she was on retreat when she fell and got a cut on the back of her head . She was just now brought to a hospital for stitches or a butterfly . They stopped the bleeding , at least . I hear she's laughing it off , as the girl's prone to do . I'll keep you all updated . 
whew ! < PROPFEMALE > Guillot is fine , it turns out . The cut on her head was shallow , basically just a tear in the skin . The surgeons put three staples in to help it heal , and cleaned the area up . She'll be home in a short while . Her big concern right now is her hair - and that's a good sign ! I'm glad it wasn't serious . Still keep her in your thoughts though , it was scary for her and she'll probably be taking Monday off . 
Is The Phantom of the Opera an opera disguised as a rock musical , or a rock musical disguised as an opera ? I'm inclined to believe the latter but I've met people who disagree . 
12 days until I have an epic session at UNO's recording studio ! I'm planning to record original pieces of mine for a solo piano album over the course of a few sessions . I'd LIKE to be able to offer it for online purchase when it's done ; this would be easier than selling hard copies . If anybody has suggestions for what online service I could realistically sell this through , I'd love to hear them . :)

It's funny to me how on the AGT finale tonight , though none of my three favorites won , I'm still very pleased with the results . I think < PROPFIRST > Grimm will represent the South well , for one thing . He has an amazing , soulful voice and a heart of gold . With the money he's obtained from victory , he and his grandparents will be living well , bringing an end to the hard times they've had since < PROPFEMALE > . Awesome . 
They call me Gato . 
will be in a studio about 12-13 hours from now , recording his mad piano skills . Expect links to some of the things I come up with . :) 
- Why today was awesome :\ 
1 . Enjoyed a fantastic recital hour where Dr. Hammann and < PROPFIRST > wowed the crowd with their organ and harpsichord skills\ 
2 . Spent about four hours in studio , recording and organizing my original piano compositions with < PROPMALE > Painter\ 
3 . Went to the dorms ' grocery to buy food . I ended up getting a free $5 sandwich . \ 
Awesome music , MY music , free sandwich ... yeah , fitting end to a great week . :D 
( GLEE status - you've been warned ) Why Finn and < PROPFEMALE > work so well together : Finn's too much of a dunce to realize that < PROPFEMALE > only wants him there to further her own interests , like for duets , or the simple fact she loves that he loves her . And < PROPFEMALE > is so insecure in spite of her talents that she needs someone in her life so relentlessly adoring that he won't condemn her for being such a morally bankrupt person . 
had his first vocal lesson with Manolito Smith this evening ! He pointed out some things I didn't even realize I was doing , particularly with my tongue , and when I changed my techniques to match what he was saying I was surprised how much better I sounded ! I'll be practicing several pieces he assigned me , until next time . He's an excellent teacher , and I can tell working with him will be both enlightening and fun . :) 
For my birthday , God sent me clear blue skies , gentle sunshine , a pleasant temperature and a refreshing breeze . It'd be a shame to let this gift go to waste - I think I'll take a stroll by the lake ! :D

by necessity we beat it up . Really badly . Unfortunately we didn't win any Silver Points ... 
Hey everybody , though I'd share another track I intend to put on my piano album . Again , there are some mistakes in this one , but it was forgivable enough for me to post . It's a simple , but lovely little song . The ever-descending < PROPFEMALE > evokes rainfall , and some stronger sections are reminiscent of thunder ( or that was the intent , anyway ) .

It's been said that everlasting friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question the friendship . These types of friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it's been or how far away they live , and they don't hold grudges . They understand that life is busy but you will ALWAYS love them . Re-post if you have at least 1 of these friends ; they will know who they are . 
True creativity is bringing order out of chaos . To organize things that are already organized rarely produces anything interesting . Whether a song is as pristine as Pachelbel's Canon or as unsettling as the Rite of Spring , the designers turned inherently disjointed concepts into a unified whole . A real artist needs chaos--it's the fuel in a creative mind's engine .
