Happy New Year 

So the fun stuff is when the Ex is trying to add you to Facebook . Wonder how long it will take to figure out that it aint gonna happen . Wonder what kind of drama would insue if I allowed it .... LOL .... 
Hanging with the children ... Can't wait for school to start back up ... 
Relaxing , happy i don't have to work tomorrow , and that I found my dog ... He slipped out of his collar and took a trot around the neighborhood ... prolly found a piece of tail or something , but he is back home safe now ... 
Taking the girls for a walk , think we might go to the beach ... 
The beach was fun , got a little burnt but the baby was super cute . This was her first time at the beach thankfully the beach here in Alpena has sand bars that make the water super shallow and nice and warm for a good 100m from shore . 
Getting ready for bed ... Gotta get up @ 5am to open the store ... 
Chillin , bout to watch a movie and crash out ... I am excited for Wednesday to arrive , cause my girl is finally moving in which makes me happy , cause this whole long distance/back and forth thing we have been doing is rather annoying . 
Cleaning and trying to get my google sidebar to work ... 
I am at my wits end ... I just dont know why the dog insists on pissing in the house directly after going to the bathroom outside ... He is such a good dog otherwise so it is really irritating . 
Relaxing , going to bed , finally watching the first season of Eureka ... I have to say that so fat season 1 seems pretty good ... 
Chillin here , getting pumped up for the 09 -10 school year ... soon I will have a degree .... ok well in about 9 months but still ... 
chillaxin , bout to go get my drunk on at the dorms ... 
Just got out of class , doing some homework .... good fun second day of school ... 
Out of work , relaxing , bout to do some homework . 
Getting ready for classes ... Fun stuff 
trying to think of someone to interview for my speech class ... crap ... 
Relaxing before work ... Everyone take some time out of your day to remember those who died on this day in ' 01 and all of the service men and woman that have given their life since , to make sure that our way of life goes unchanged and the terrorists remain in their own countries ... Thank you to all the men and woman of our armed services ( home and abroad ) . 
Well I have had just about enough of this freaking computer ... Its really starting to test my < PROPFEMALE > ... 
If all goes well I will be ordering my new laptop tomorrow , I love last minute decisions ... 
So I finally decided on my laptop , and its on its way 
Cloud so swift the rains fallin ' in Gonna ' see a movie called Gunga Din . Pack up your money put up your tent in the wind You ain't a goin ' no where 
Wishing ASUSTeK would finish my freeking notebook's repairs already ... I am missing it . 
Happy thanksgiving everyone ... Now to get ready for work ... 
You know there is something messed up when you live in Northern Michigan ( on lake Huron ) and there is zero snow on the ground in December ; as a side note , last year at this time we were pushing 2.5 - 3 feet ... I miss the snow ! - Then again this is MI so I guess it is probably just par for the course . 
OK , now this is more like it .... College closed for the day finals pushed back till friday and a good foot on the ground ... 
Wow ... Just looked at my grades for this last semester ... 3 A's and an A- ... Leaving me with a 3.925 GPA ... 
So glad classes are over for a Month ... With any luck I will graduate summa cum laude in May with my Associates in Utility Technology ... Then what to do ... 
Finally a day off ... Getting ready to play some Ultima Online for a little while ... Nothing like a 15 year old MMORPG to get the blood pump'n .... haha . Still though , it is a great game . 
Small Gathering at my crib tonight to kick off the new year , starting at around 9 or 10 ... BYOB ( I have some but invariably not enough ) 
Start classes on the 11th ... fun . 
Love when I go in to work to get something and I end up closeing ... Cant complain too much tho ... work is work . 
First day of classes tomorrow ... Super excited . Hopefully this semester wont be as tumultuous as last ... Not counting on it ... 
One class today , everything was great . Class is gonna be informative , I cant wait to get to the hands on portion of the class . 
Relaxing before class ... 50 < PROPFEMALE > at noon and 4hrs at 5p ... fun . 
The second theory , known as the conventional current flow theory , is older than the electron flow theory and states that current flows from the most positie point to the most negative . 
I < PROPFEMALE > like a cholo ... 
Damn ... Just got out of work , and was locked out of my room ... Had to pick the lock ... all is well now . 
Getting ready for my Poly Phase Metering class ... Should prove to be educational , unlike my PolySci class on the other hand . 
Quiz in metering class today , hope I did alright ... Need to take better notes in this class I think . 
Wired up 4 meter bases , weather heads , and service entrances in class today ( we took turns connecting different parts ) pretty straight forward .

I have noticed no change in the facebook layout ... What gives ? 
Ahhh working all day and/or going to school every day for 3 weeks and counting ... I love it , give me some more please ! 
Working till close tonight . 
Feeling left out here in one of the northern most citys in the Lower Penninsula .... 1 - 3 inches .... what is that ... I am jelous of the down staters right now . Wish I was getting a foot of snow . 
I feel like shit . Worst day in 2 or 3 years .... going back to bed ... 
Well I think I finally quit smoking for good ... We will see , I am at one week and counting . Was using the patch , but they suck and dont stay on very well so I stopped yesterday . Think I can make it on my own . Come on will power ! 
Ahhhh ... Jagermeister ! 
Just chillin out , class tomorrow at noon , trying to decide what game to play to occupy my time ... I guess there is always homework ... 
Lets take a walk down the hallwayyyy ... 
Off to the Sec of State , time to renew the tags on my vehicle . YAY ! 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME ... i should be smashed right now but I decided not to drink tonight ... Well I am sipping a beer but not \drinking \"." 
Happy Birthday to me .... Happy Birthday to me ..... I am doing a debate for my English class . ( pro ) Legalize Prostitution . Its actually a lot of fun looking up research ... and before you ask , yes I would vote to legalize it so long as it would be regulated and controlled . 
Thank you to all of my great friends , who helped to make my birthday ( yesterday ) one of the best birthdays I have had in a very long time ... I really do appreciate all of you ! 
Writing a paper and going to work 
Finally finished my 4 < PROPFEMALE > image analysis paper for english ... it only took all day , but it is done . Rough draft due tomorrow for peer review , and editing ... I am going to bed now . I have had enough of school for today . 
Go away from my window , leave at your own choosen speed ... 
X sub L equals 2piefL 
I need some Lando Calrissian ... Jebby needs to get home soon . 
I got nothin ... 
Getting ready for work ... 2 - close ... Fun stuff . 
Relaxing after class ... 60 degrees and < PROPFEMALE > ... Awesome ! 
Getting ready for class until 1pm , work @ 2pm till close . Cant wait until Political Science Class tomorrow ... Should be interesting . 
I refuse to pay , and I will refuse to pay the fine ... Come fucking make me ... Damn that pisses me off . I make 500 dollars a month . That is already not enough to cover my rent , utilities , and daily cost of living , I wonder where they expect me to get the money to but Insurance ... Maybe we need to raise < PROPFEMALE > imum wage to counteract this ... I vote Yes for < PROPFEMALE > wage increase to $20/hr 
I still vote for < PROPFEMALE > wage increase to $20/hr . 
14 states filed suite against the federal government . ( it is unconstitutional for them to require us to have health insurance ) I love that shit . Regardless of wether or not you support the < PROPMALE > ( or think it is good or bad ) you have to admit that it is not constitutional . It is very clear to me ... [ flame on ] 
Hey look this is a status update . Amazing it isnt about the police state or healthcare .... lol well damn it , it wasnt supposed to be . LOL 
Chillin at my Sisters house for my baby's 3rd Birthday Party ... Happy Birthday Jacklynn < PROPFEMALE > . 
I'm going to work 
I love the process of registering on all 8 billion job search sites on the internet , just so I can have access to the handful of Jobs in my field . 
Going to Walmart ... Wish I had a camera http://www.peopleofwalmart.com/ 
Off to work . 
Just got out of AC/DC Fundamentals ... Lots of fun learning about how RLC Series and Parallel circuits work . 
first post from my new phone 
so apparently , my phone number has not ported yet ... but i have web and yahoo ... 
< PROPFIRST>'s mom has got it going on ... 
This isn't bias , it's corruption . News organizations are supposed to be watch dogs , not attack dogs . The Tea Party should be scrutinized like every other political movement . But that's not what's going on here . A large part of the national press is out to destroy these folks . And that's flat out wrong . - < PROPMALE > O'Reilly 
I wish that we as a people would stand up for ourselves , get the politicians to wake up and smell the coffee , and start working for us ( collectively not just their party's ideals ) not against us . 
I wish I could get a real Job , the stress of trying is going to kill me , or at least destroy my life . 
Poli-Sci class here I come ... I think I have taken more notes in this one class than I did all throughout High School ... well that I guess would probably explain a few things too ... lol 
I didnt write this , but I thought it was funny ... 
4/20 f0r t3h win ... 
Google Docs is an awesome utility for college students with long papers to write or group papers in which collaboration is required .. Thumbs up for Google Docs ! 
Goodnight . 
Good Stuff ... I turn in my paper for poli-sci today .... 25% of my grade .... 
Got work in the morning till 6 , then going to help out an instructor with some yard work . 
Ugh , Work at 8am - 5pm ... No lunch , no money , no life outside of work and school ... This shit better be worth it . 
This is my sentiments exactly ... 
So How about those ( insert your default/favorite team here ) ... For me it is SPARTANS ... GO GREEN ! 
LOL ... I thought you all should see this cause it is super funny ( somewhat annoying as well ) , one thing tho , you will probably want to turn down your volume . http://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=1283411165511&oid=110699382301977 
Good night my sweet < PROPFEMALE > . Good Night world , Class in the morining .. Fun . 
internet at the hose is down ... I think it likely wont be back on anytime soon . My coorespondance may be limited for a while . Awesome ! 
Internetz back up and running .... Phew that was a close one ... 
Work 1 - 10 ... fun . 
English Debate ( Final exam ) @ 2pm , Political Science Final exam @ 5pm ... After that , nothing until commencement on Thurs @ 7pm ... 
Finals are done . Aced the English Debate ( We win ) and did satisfactorily on my Political Science Exam ... Should come out of this semester with an -A or A average , and I shouldn't see much of a decrease in my GPA if at all . I hope anyway . I would like to keep it over 3.90 so ..... fingers crossed ... 
It's all over .... I am officially smart .... Just Graduated with an Associates in Applied Science - Utility Technology . 
Happy mothers day 
WOW ... What an awesome trip ... Check out the photos if it suits you .. Some of the most beautiful places in the country if not the world ... Not to mention all right in our back yard . 
Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose 
New Rule for future reference . Do NOT use my posts for taking out your personal hatred , or fears , or any other kind of personal attacks on any other person . Period . \

Well today is day 2 of summer camp for Sienna ... She is staying in the frontier village of Spring Hill ! ( Evert , MI ) ... I bet she is having tons of fun ... 
This is totally worth watching ... Very interesting , and something I have been saying for several years now ... 
Work ... 9-6 ... lame . 
So apparently , now posting political comments is tantamount to baiting people into a debate . \ 
FYI , My opinion is my opinion . \ 
I do not post it so that I can have a debate ( unless I call out someone by name in my post or subsequent comments ) or for any reason other than the following ... 
Here is a question for everyone ... Especially any of the PHD's in the crowd ... \ 
What is the proper use of a comma ... \ 
I have heard the standard grammatical uses ;\ 
to separate the elements in a series , or to connect two independent \ 
clauses ( comma plus Boysfan ) , or when used before and after a part of a sentence that can be removed without changing the essential\ 
meaning of that sentence . 
Oxymoron ? \ 
Washing no-no parts not your own . \ 
Dirty and Clean at the same time . 
Ahhhhhhhh .... finally out of work , and will be leaving for lake superior ASAP ... 
Just got back from the U . P ... \ 
Copper Harbor is beautiful , awesome weather , no run-ins with the law , didnt get eaten by the wildlife . All in all , I would say the best vacation I have ever taken . \ 
Will be posting pictures as soon as I have them on the computer . 
Work @ 6am , so I am off to bed . Out @ 2pm and then 2 days off ... 
For every bad thing someone can come up with about the republicans , I can come up with an equivalent evil about the democrats . \ 
That\ 
has been my point all along . BOTH sides are Effing us in the A . 
Mmmmm ... 7 n 7 .... Tasty . 
Well I have just finished registering for classes ... Looks like I will have my second degree sometime in May . This time for Electrical Maintenance Tech ... Hope this one pans out better than the last one has ... 
Day off tomorrow ; Beer , check . Boat , check , Bait , check . Tomorrow cannot come fast enough . Think I will be hitting the sack early tonight . 
So the first day of classes was alright . Lots of homework already ... Should be a good semester ... 
I just wanted to pop on here and say , damn that was a sweet game by MSU the other day ... Just got done watching the first half again , and as I suspected it was just as awesome as it was the first time .... GO GREEN 
I love work ... especially when it involves dealing with morons ... 
I just had to get on here and let everyone know that if any republicans win , that it had to be only because FOX news lied and cheated , and forced the uneducated masses of the country to vote for them . \ 
Oh and apparently now that Rand < PROPFIRST > has won ( according to Olbermann and crew ) he is going to destroy the economy's of the world by making < PROPFEMALE > default on our debt .... 
Time for class .. Digital Electronics are cool ... And NAND Or NOR Exclusive Or Exclusive NOR Inverter ... Fun stuff for sure . 
Touchdown ! GO GREEN !!! 
So how about that global warming ? Its like 10 degrees out ... HOT ... 
< PROPFEMALE > CHRISTMAS ... I got a remote controlled car , what did you get . 
Feel like shit ... Very Zombiesque ... Stupid flu ! 
There are unsung heroes working < PROPMALE > from home to restore power to people they don't know . They work in snow , ice , & rain . They are LINEMAN If you see crews out working do one or two things : Say a prayer for them & If you are lucky enough to have power , offer them a thermos of hot coffee , soup etc . Anything to show your appreciation ! If you've ever lost power & had it restored by a LINEMAN , show some respect . 
If you are going to sing the national anthem LEARN THE FUCKING WORDS TO THE SONG !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BEFORE you sing it on national TV ! 
TOUCHDOWN !!!!!!! 
WAY TO GO GREEN BAY !!!!!!! 
how i'd love to spit some beechnut in that dude's eyes ... 
If you're interested in complicating dumb media narratives and blowing the minds of some of your leftard friends , here's a spirited posting at Reddit by someone with the handle epistemicfail : 
Dont ask me no stupid questions , and I wont tell you no lies ... 
Winning ! 
Thanks for all the birthday wishes everyone ... I really do appreciate it . 
Just wanted to get on here and tell everyone thanks again for all the birthday wishes . I had an alright day considering I had to work , just sat around mostly and played on the internets .... 
Anyone playing RIFT ? Is it worth it ? 
Good luck to all the \Recall Snyder\ " fans ... It didnt work for Granholm 
So none of you are playing RIFT ? 
I normally dont do this because I find it annoying .. that said . \ 
I believe in the right to keep and bear arms . One Facebooker has challenged all gun owners to put this on their wall . The Supreme Court of the United States has affirmed that the right to keep and bear arms is a fundamental right of the individual . If you Believe in the 2nd Amendment and you are not afraid to show it , re-post this if you like your GUNS ! 
Here is a few tidbits from the < PROPMALE > that everyone is saying gives the Gov the right to take over and sell your town .... lol 
Ok , you win . I give up . \ 
I am gonna just sit back and watch what happens . \ 
I hope it works out well . \ 
I can say that I doubt they realized how badly it could be twisted to make them look ... Someone is taking ques from the enemy . \ 
Oh well . 
Despite the misinformation being spread by the media and on the Internet , the legislation does not give the governor the ability to remove elected officials at will . Claims that it does are simply not true . 
“Life , < PROPFEMALE > , and property do not exist because men have made laws . On the contrary , it was the fact that life , < PROPFEMALE > , and property existed beforehand that caused men to make laws in the first place . ”\

Quit smoking and drinking ... Now gotta get off nicotine , caffeine , sugar and then start running ... Summer here I come . 
The estimated cost of ObamaCare has already risen from $1 trillion to $2 trillion from 2014-2023 . \ 
Over 1,000 groups have received ObamaCare waivers , including powerful labor unions who helped elect President Obama . \ 
Doctors are speaking out that ObamaCare will force them to close their private practices . \ 
And states are working to opt out for fear of the escalating costs and burdensome regulations .
