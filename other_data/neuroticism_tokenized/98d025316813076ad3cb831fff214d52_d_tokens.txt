I was riding on a train yesterday when I noticed a man folding something out of paper . I suddenly got an idea , and started folding the napkin in my hand into a crane . Once finished , I leaned over and put it on the seat next to him . A little while later , when the man was getting off the train , he stopped at my seat and smiled , placing the most beautifully folded giraffe I'd ever seen on the seat next to me .
