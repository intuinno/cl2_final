Mom and Dad taught me to be nice to everyone . What I failed to understand is that there are people in the world who take \nice\ " and beat you to death with it ! " 
thinks that no one should die because they cannot afford health care , and no one should go broke because they get sick . If you agree , please post this as your status for the rest of the day .

On my way to Oktoberfest .... someone asked if there will be beer .... I find saying Oktoberfest and \there will be beer\ " in the same sentence to be redundant .... " 
The Christian mistake : I thought that being faithful was about becoming someone other than who I was , in other words , and it was not until this project failed that I began to wonder if my human wholeness might be more useful to God than my exhausting goodness .
