So I've heard \12 monkeys\ " and \ " neighbot totoro\ " . Taking a poll for must see movies ! ^.^ \ 
Anyone know a good site for tattoos ? I'm looking for tribal . forearms and back . Possibly a shoulder , but doubtful . -- Also for anyone around the K-town area , who's a good tattooist ?

If anyone wishes to subscribe to my special weight loss plan , please forward me a message ... and take over for my shift . :-P I'm tired .
