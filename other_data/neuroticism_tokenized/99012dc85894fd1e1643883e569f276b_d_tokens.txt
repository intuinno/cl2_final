Would anyone be willing to babysit a rat for a week in October ? 
65 days and counting ........ 
60 days . We are officially at the two month < PROPFIRST > ! 
is safe and sound in canton , Mississippi . Its so nice and warm ! I love the sunshine . Not to mention my hair looks outstandingly fabulous and my skin isn't all dried out anymore . And everywhere I look , people are hiring . We'll see what I can find . I even found a job for the state that I applied for . 
-It's raining , I'm listless . Theres only so much I can clean ............. my movie website quit working =( Oh well , the bathroom isn't going to clean itself . 
is sad =( I don't like being all by myself . * sigh * but he had to go to work .... 
So , ok , I got a job down here in < PROPMALE > , MS . It is my absolute dream job- for anyone that knows me ......... I work at PetsMart , in the PetsHotel ......... and I get to play with dogs all day . It is exhausting . And I love it . < PROPFIRST > loves being down here . Our next door neighbor ROCKS ! I so wish all of you people out there that I care about were down here tho . BTW , The weather is AWESOME ! 
I so can't wait to get my own car ! 
goin to see new moon ......... woot woot ..... 
saw New < PROPFEMALE > . Loved it , advise everyone to go see it , too . 
I got covered in concentrated floor disinfectant at work today ........ made my whole body super itchy for the hour and a half I had to wear it for ..................... on the bright side , my uniform is super clean now ! 
Happy Thanksgiving everybody !!!!!!!!!!! 
Man , am I tired ..... 
It actually snowed this morning ......... but it's 45 degrees out , sunshiningly bright , and no wind ! Take that snow ! The sun has kicked your ass once again !!!!!!!!! 
Ugh . Why are we getting sick now ? Couldn't it have waited until after my birthday ? 
To < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > - my birthdays about to get better ! I'm going back to bed ! No work , < PROPFIRST>'s at school and I'm home alone ! Finally ! Slleeeeeeeeppppp !!!!! 
Well . My birthday's almost over , had a good day . Slept a bunch , got my hair done , had an awesome dinner and now a rental movie with some sangria . Yummy . Was gonna go to the theater ........... missed the last showtime for the movie I wanted . Oh well . Still had a good day . Love my hair cut ! 
Ahhh , it's almost 7 in the morning and already 60 degrees outside . A little misting , no real rain and I feel sorry for all you people out there freezin your buns off ! So nice here ! 
Ooooh , medication induced sleep is soooooo nice =) 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas to everyone , and to everyone a Bah Humbug . 
There's nothing like getting paid the day after christmas and discovering that you recieved more money than what you calculated yourself ! I like money ......... =) 
I got infuriated at a woman today that runs her own rescue . She runs it like a filthy kennel . Her dogs that she brought in were covered head to toe in mud ! She can't even keep them clean ! 
No ! It's 23 degrees down here with a windchill of 5 degrees , and everything's frozen . I didn't mean for MI weather to follow me !!!! 
Oh , how I hate working in the early am when I can't get to sleep . But ain't that the norm ? 
Yay for the weather again ! It was 55 and < PROPFEMALE > yesterday . And its supposed to be in the low 60's today . YAY ! 
Ugh , I hate science fair projects . They should never be mandatory . 
I hate living in the land of perpetual laundry . I'm drowning in lavender dryer sheets !!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
I finally have two days off in a row !!!!!! Woohoo !!!! 
I love Kung-Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuu !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
I feel so disgusting . Rescued a stray . Flea dipped him . Discovered engorged ticks . I screamed and got incredibly squeamish . EEEEWWWW !!!!!!!!! 
Yay , no more ticks or fleas !!!!!! And his neck wound now looks completely superficial ! I cleaned it up and sprayed him with an antibacterial fist aid spray that I picked up from the pet store . Pictures will be coming very soon . And we may have already found him a home . =) =) =) =) =) 
Omg , I am sooooooo tired right now . I seriously don't think that I'll even make it till 11 . That makes me feel like an old lady . My 50+ dad stays up later than that ! 
Why is it snowing ? We've got 6 inches ! I thought I moved away from this crap ! Go away snow !!!!!! 
Goodnight all and hopefully this time when I fall asleep I'll hear the alarm clock ........ my new bed is that comfy ! Lol . In some ways , yes , I hate it . < PROPFIRST > missed the bus twice last week because of it ....... 
Totally lost the phone . Hopefully , now that I'm home , I can find it .... 
FOUND THE PHONE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yay !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Just watched the teaser trailer for ' Eclipse ' . AMAZING !!!!!! I sooooooooo cannot wait for this movie to come out ! 
Uuuugggghhhh ! I'm bored , awake , but tired at the same time , hungry and the damn computer won't let me download my pics for some reason . I think I will solve everything with a hot bubble bath and a big ' ol bowl of soup ! 
OMG , what a day . I have yet another 10 hour workday to look forward to tomorrow . My boss told me today just how much she appreciates my working all these long hours now that we're short staffed . And , she put in for me to get a raise . The raise is almost a dollar more than what I'm making now . I hope it goes through . I'm excited . Now if only I could sleep all night long ...... 
I was so tired at work today that I fell asleep sitting on the toilet for 5 minutes . And noone noticed . Lol . 
Man , I would really like to flog you after work , behind the hotel . That way , there wouldn't be any witnesses . I so hate fake , whiny-ass bitches ........ 
Kitchen counter or by the computer . 
Ugh , too tired to fight sleep anymore . Trying to win an auction . I'll probably lose it now . Off to < PROPFEMALE > land once more today . 
Oy ! I'm getting another sinus headache , I feel absolutely exhausted , and I'm working more . Yay . Even the dogs are sleeping more lately . Lol . Off to bed to start another day tomorrow of training for my newest job . 
Dear Asshole , go away . I am not in the mood to deal with you anymore ....... I wish I was born into a sane , logical thinking family . Some of them are , but only some of them . 
Happy early Mother's Day to all that it applies too . I get to work on my Mother's Day . My only wish is that I get paid holiday pay . How dare a man tell me that its not a qualified holiday ? 
Another day gone by . Spent my Mother's Day at work , then went home . < PROPFIRST > made me a Mother's Day Spongebob Squarepants picture . I loved it , of course . Then proceeded to get loved on as I passed out on the couch . Full body scratching is the best ! 
I have wednesday off and I can't wait ! A day off with my baby ....... how long will we sleep for ? Movie maybe ? Or even lunch date before < PROPFIRST > gets home from school ? Last lunch date we found this awesome mexican restaurant . This time if we go , margaritas ! 
I would like to be drunk right now ...... maybe then I'd be tired and in a better mood . 
Can't wait to sleep . Just got home today from a 16 hour road trip to get my stuff out of my dad's house back in MI . Didn't even get a < PROPMALE > to see all of the people that I would've liked to and now I have to work in the morning . With difficult and irritating dogs . Ew . 
I'm done . F**k this s**t . Back to the way it was , I guess . I'm tired just thinking about it . =( 
Had a great day . < PROPMALE > out with Kaleena and the boys at the pool . Had a bangin hamburger helper dinner and I actually burned a little . But it'll be gone by tomorrow and I'll be back to being paper white again . Poo . Here's hoping tomorrow is a good day too . =) 
Everybody check out Monkey in my pics . He is my first official haircut outside of work where I actually took pictures . I'm proud of my work and < PROPMALE > really did want me to cut his dog's hair like that ! 
Just got paid and already I want to cry . Rent is due and now I have 30 bucks for food until next friday . Department of Human Services better not deny me . I swear if they do , I will cry . 
I love days off . I just hope that it stays a day off tomorrow . I could really use the money but I don't want to go in tomorrow if they call me ..... 
Its never really a full day at work until I have a near heart attack . 
Aah . I can finally go to bed . The girls have been beautified and are ready for Grandma B . to get here tomorrow ! I know she is just going fall head over heels for < PROPFEMALE > . Lol . 
Exhaustion is fun ............................. 
Nothing is quite like working with animals during a full < PROPFEMALE > ..................... 
It's official : PetsMart is sending me off to groom school . I finally got the hotel info . And they allow dogs !!!!!!!!!!!! < PROPFEMALE > gets a little vacation of her own ! I just hope that my roommate doesn't mind . Lol . 
About to take < PROPFIRST > to school . Yes , I know we're late but he got green all week and < PROPFIRST > wanted to treat him to pancakes and sausage for breakfast . School isn't going anywhere ! Then , it's off to the reservoir again to go swimming with the dogs ............. 
This is so not fair ...... I'm supposed to be going to Alabama next week and I'm sick as a dog right now ! This is not going to stop me from going to the academy ! This better not be pneumonia ! If it is , I'm blaming Pepper !!!! 
Hey , peoples in MS , could you possibly lend < PROPFIRST > a hand on getting another job ? His boss is an absolute < PROPMALE > , he isn't going anywhere , and all the other places that he's sent resume's in and aps haven't called him back . We need help and fast food isn't going to cut it . He needs to make more than minimum wage . 
Ugh , I'm too pissed off to go to sleep !!!! 
Only approx . 48 more hours until I leave for < PROPMALE > . I don't want to go , but I know that I have to in order to better our situation . I'll be honest , I'm nervous as all hell ! 
So , who wants to come out to < PROPMALE > , stay in an incredible hotel with me and let me use their car for the month of September ? 
First day of academy is over . I like it . I'm excited to take my clippers to a dog . All we did today was talk ........ 
Tomorrow off , plan on spending it at the pool ! Already stayed at the pool for an hour and a half after work today . I will get tan somehow , lol . Now , dinnertime ! 
day off . pretty sure i'm getting my cold back . =( i'm bored . and lonely . =( i miss peeps .... 
Man , today was good . I got to do a Bichon , which turned out really cute , and I managed to get sum medicine from Target . Sadly , my bichon left before I could a picture of it . Now , time to nap before dinner . Yay . 
I really don't appreciate being disrespected and talked down to ..... 
Courage , The Cowardly Dog is where it's at ! Lol ! 
< PROPFIRST > just told me that < PROPFIRST > got his report card today ............. 88 in math , 94 in reading and 100 for everything else !!!!!!!! I'm so proud of him !!!!!!!!!!!! 
Rough day today , but my dogs turned out great ! 
A true friend doesn't care when you're broke , what you weigh , if your house is a mess , about your past , or if your family is filled with crazy people . They love you for who you are . A true friend can go long periods of time without speaking to you and never question the friendship . Repost if u have at least one true friend . They will know who they are ........... 
Ahhh , * sigh * . I love reading romance novels ! So steamy ! 
Exhausted ! Got off work at 9pm and have to be back at 7am . When you don't normally sleep without some kind of chemical aid , it sucks ! 
Feather pillows are the shiznit !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I always love thinking that ignorance is bliss . But then again , knowledge is power ! ........ tee < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > .......

I'm coming out for lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender equality because it's 2010 and only five states plus DC recognize that love , not gender , is what matters in a marriage .
