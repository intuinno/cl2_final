Everyone seems to be getting sick this week ! I feel like the only healthy person in the world , even though I just got my shots on Thursday and can barely move my brutally bruised arm ( not a dramatization ) . 
My feet hurt ! > n < 
Science Olympiad was , once again , epic ( of course not as much as last year since we didn't have < PROPFIRST > or < PROPFEMALE > ) . Three gold medals and only one bronze . I'd say I did pretty good . :] 
Who knew that getting up at six in the morning to compete against nerds in an all-out battle of the brains then baby-sitting for an hour only to wake up at ten and go to the zoo for four hours then having to check out of school today for varsity bowling could be so exhausting ? I sure as hell didn't . 
is not sure she's loved . 
Remember Me , @ < PROPFEMALE > . <3 
Remember me , < PROPFEMALE > . <3 
Went to go see < PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland again , this time in 3D . Still amazing . 
I know I always say I don't like guys with blonde hair , but < PROPMALE > has stolen my heart ! <3 
And so another week of school ensues ... How long until we get out , exactly ? 
Why was I born lazy ? >:o 
How is it possible that I fall asleep on the couch as soon as I get home when I wasn't tired nearly five minutes before ? 
I think I might have cracked a rib while falling out of bed . :o 
I miss you Eleanoooooooooor ! TAT 
is 350 < PROPMALE > away from home and misses her mom already ! 
Rainbows in Marrero , what ? This one's for < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > ! ;) 
Mrs. Fettet say that the French class doesn't celebrate Cinco de Mayo , so I couldn't sing silly Spanish songs all class . > : 0

I have no computer anymore . It crashed the other day . 
It's official ! Louisianime is a GO . 
\I think there was a unicorn in my room last night . I saw some sparkles . Do you smell a rainbow ? \"" 
Every time someone looks at me now , I think I'm in a dream and their going to attack me . God dammit ! 
So , I got two homemade cookies from < PROPFEMALE > this morning , a blow pop from < PROPFEMALE > , a ring pop from Ms. Capaci , everyone in French did their homework so I got a twix , and random Ms. Laurent-was-being-amazing < PROPFEMALE > . Today was the best day evar . \

\Please tell me you have your pants on ? \ " - < PROPFIRST>'s mom . :) " 
To be honest : I have no clue why people are going around saying , ' to be honest . ' 
DOES ANYONE KNOW IF WE HAVE FRENCH II HOMEWORK ?! > : 0 
Last nigt's walk : I was saying something when all of the sudden < PROPFIRST > Troxler hears this weird demonic screaming . We both run off shrieking in fear . Then , after the second water stop , we hear something behind us and turn to see someone running towards us ! We fall onto the ground screaming at the top of our lungs , but we realize that it was just < PROPMALE > that had run past us ... 
Really , < PROPMALE > Hartley ? REALLY ? 
So I did 39 curl-ups tody in P.E. ; only 1 away from an A . Ohmigosh , Chiochio , just give me a freaking A already ! > n < 
Chemistry homework , < PROPFEMALE > Paitsel ?

Tastes like rainbows ... :) 
Worst cramps in the world . Just in time for my birthday ! Joy . 
Something's wrong with me . I'm listening to TURKISH music ? Although their songs have nice beats , they're really weird ... ( Eleanor Sema Hatipoglu should be proud of me . ) 
P.E. Exam = Epic fail . \ 
Shouldn't she have gone over it before she gave it to us ?! 
Thanks to everyone one who wished me a happy birthday ! My phone had about twenty something new text messages over the past few days . \ 
I think I'm now going to ignore the fact that I have exams on Monday and Tuesday so that I can slack off and play Harvest < PROPFEMALE > . :) 
\A-well-a everybody's heard about the bird\ 
Tomorrow my lunch will be packed in the cutes lunch box EVAR , curtesy of < PROPFEMALE > Dinh . :)))) 
Holy shit . \ 
Well , I just cried my eyes out . Either my computer is crashed or it has a virus . And just when things were starting to go right . :( 
\You know you're not supposed to have food in your room ! It'll attract ants ... and possibly < PROPFEMALE > O'Donnell . \"" 
\I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin
