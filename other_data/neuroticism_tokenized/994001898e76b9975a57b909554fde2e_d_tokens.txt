Just getting over a wicked cold - congestion stayed in my chest ( as usual ) so I'm hacking like you wouldn't believe . Feeling better today - drugs are a miracle ( when used properly ) ... 

Two of our kids ( < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > ) are asleep here in the house and two of our kids ( < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > ) are with their families this morning and soon all will be here to open presents and love each other only the way a family can ( that means loud and with passion ) and life just couldn't be better . And a special thanks to < PROPFEMALE > for her being her and loving all of us every day . Life is good - drink it up ... 
Waiting for winter to end and spring to arrive - I hate cold weather ... 
Back into the 70's again today ( and through the weekend ) , maybe we're going to have an early spring ... 
Temp in the low 60's with bright sunshine - windows open and life is good ... 
Just home from The Eagles concert - good but not as good as Sting and The < PROPMALE > Philharmonic Orchestra concert Friday night at The Woodlands ...
