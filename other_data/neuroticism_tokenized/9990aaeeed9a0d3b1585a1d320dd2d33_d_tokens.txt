is saying farewell to Hyde County . 

is back home . Home Sweet Home Wisconsin , where humidity is low and cows are plentiful . 
has a room that is now creeper viewing free . 
is loving the new Crowder Album ! Amazing .... That's all I've got to say . 
is finding the only thing standing in his way of an amazing weekend is one stinkin chem exam . Bring it on ! 
one more exam ! I can almost taste the freedom . 
is headin to Genoa City for New Years ! Happy New Years everyone . 
is praising God for His power . Over gluten allergies and all ! 
has the feeling that God's about to do something awesome this weekend and it's gonna blow my mind . 
........ He did . Now it's time to find a fattened calf , cause this return calls for a celebration . 
loves Croix . 
is rounding the turn and making his way onto the final stretch . Sight of the finish line is giving just enough endurance to finish . 
Thanks all for such awesome birthday and graduation wishes , especially those I had the privilege of spending my day with . 
was surprisingly entertained by a hip hop/rap show . Don't know where that came from . Granted , the company helped . 
IS DONE !!!!!!!!! ( depending on my final grade ) 
What to do tomorrow ? Oh wait , not going to class ! 
is there anyone still looking for a place to live or considering relocating , cause I know of a pretty sweet place at 820 Elmwood Ave that's in search for that special someone to make our home complete .
