It has been said that true friends can go long periods of time without speaking & never question your friendship . This type of friend picks up like they just spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it's been , how far away they live & they don’t hold grudges . They understand that life's busy but , that you'll always love them . Repost this if your are lucky enough to have at least 1 of these friends .

Why is it that certain people can have an opinion and when other people have an opinion they are considered Idiots ??? 
Why does it seem that some ( not all ) people who have a degree with a piece of paper attached . Think that they are more proper and holier then though , over someone without a piece of paper but , has Decades of life experience . So what if they have an expensive piece of paper to wipe their ass with . I don't care . 
Why does some people who have a degree , Think they are more proper and holier then though , over someone without a degree , but , has Decades of life experience .
