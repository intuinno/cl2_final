sorta , kinda itty bitty , teeny weeny slightly wishes she was going back to Mansfield ... 
cannot wait for the regular season to start , even the rookies look awesome :-) GO STEELERS ! 
<3 We Remember .... 9/11/2001 <3 
pinch me so I know that this dream that I'm living is real ... 
never knew she would miss MU this much ... :-\\ 
toga party :-) 
i <3 my Steelers 
booooooo boyfriend is working 3rd shift for who knows how long and i see him for 10 minutes a day in passing as i'm leaving for work and he's coming home AND i have to sleep alone ... ughhh dislike ! 
i love football sundays <3 GO STEELERS ! <3 
sooo babe decided TODAY was the day to put new flooring in the kitchen .. therefore that is what we are spending the night doing ... 
Steelers baby ! <3 
Everyone else gets to go to Mansfield for Alumni weekend ... and I get to go to work ... ughhhh 
Should be playing in the alumni game right about now and enjoying all the lovely alumni festivities ... :-( boo for being a big girl 
one more thing before you leave ... \don't forget to remember me ... \"" 
sooo many bills , sooo little money .. :-\\ 
fuck you cbs for blacking out the steelers game for the ravens and fuck you comcast for not having nfl sunday ticket ... ughhhh gotta watch online :-( GO STEELERS <3 
jackass 3D = hilarious 
thinks is absolute bullshit for < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > to get a $ 75,000 fine for an AWESOME hit . The NFL needs to relax , football is a contact sport that's not for a bunch of babies - playing is the risk and if they don't like it , dont fucking play ! 
Steelers baby ! <3 <3 
... I can't always be the optimist 
I'll give you my heart , and let you just hold it -- I'd give you my soul , but I already sold it ... 
Happy 3rd Birthday < PROPFEMALE > girl !! <3 
Happy Veterans Day to our real Heroes <3 <3 Thank you and God Bless 
.. and with my last single breath , I'll still be singing to you ...
