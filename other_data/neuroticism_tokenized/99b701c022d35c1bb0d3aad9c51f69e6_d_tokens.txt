Favorite #1 Proverbs 3:3 -4 Let love and faithfulness never leave you ; bind them around your neck , write them on the tablet of your heart . Then you will win favor and a good name in the sight of God and man . 
Favorite #2 Proverbs 3:21 -24 My son , preserve sound judgment and discernment , do not let them out of your sight ; they will be life for you , an ornament to grace your neck . Then you will go on your way in safety , and your foot will not stumble ; when you lie down , you will not be afraid ; when you lie down , your sleep will be sweet .

There are six things the Lord hates , seven that are detestable to him : haughty eyes , a lying tongue , hands that shed innocent blood , a heart that devises wicked schemes , feet that are quick to rush into evil , a false witness who pours out lies and a man who stirs up dissension among brothers . - Proverbs 6:16 -19
