Yeah , testing this out and shit . 

3DS looks cool , it's got an analog stick like I've been wanting and there's a new Kid Icarus game coming out for it , really want to buy one . 
Blah blah , < PROPMALE > joke , blah . 
Since the human body is apparently around 60% water , would cannibalism be wrong if I was reaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaally thirsty ? 
Have to fix my nailpolish again , keeps chipping off . 
Sonic Colors looks cool , but resembles Unleashed abit too much , in my opinion . I'll wait and see though . 
< PROPMALE > likes munchkins filled with whipped cream . 
First day of summer , apparently , even though it's been hot as fuck for awhile , I think my calendar is low on batteries . 
Was in a store the other day and was like HEY ARE YOU GETTING THE SPECIAL EDITION OF THE NEW KORN ALBUM and the cashier chick was like IUNNO PROBABLY , without checking . Cashiers are so lazy , I wanna be one when I grow up . 
GOD DAMNIT < PROPMALE > , STOP LIKING MY SHIT ARGH 
Apparently the writers from Happy Tree Friends are going to be writing jokes for Sonic Colors . 
Fucking fuck , meant to go to Youtube , not this shit . 
Happy birthday Sonic , even though some of your latest games suck , I still love you . 
Got alot of rain today , no oil though . =/ 
It always freaks me out when someone uses a picture of themself as a child for their profile pic . 
Just caught this huge bug , it flew at me and landed on my shirt , so I knocked it off and it bit into my computer chair seat and wouldn't let go till I gave it a shove with my shoe , then it came after my shoe and I caught it in a box , glad the mofo didn't bite me . 
Fuck yeah , finally got to change my username . 
Holy fuck it's cold , I'm wearing my hoodie in summer . 
I'm so lazy , I haven't left my bed for long all day . 
Ganon's a pretty tough boss in ALTTP . 
Redeemed my Club Nintendo Gold reward , a calendar I won't get till around the end of the year . The Platinum reward is cool , even though it's just the figures from a recent < PROPFIRST > figure series glued to a black base and painted better . Used most of my points to get a Wiimote holder . 
Making a < PROPMALE > figurine of Ganon , doing details on a figure that's around an inch tall is a nightmare , thinking I'll use my wire cutters on some safety pins for his trident . 
I'm fucking sore as hell today . 
Broke my favorite pair of glasses , I swear this pair is haunted , I keep seeing stuff at the corners of my eyes and random shit looks like it's moving . 
Why the hell am I setting up a formspring ? 
< PROPMALE > got me into haiku . \

Blood , flowing freely\ 
Bodies , falling from the sky\ 
Now , we all must die 
I wanna destroy some shit really bad . 
I'm so fucking tired of the song Crying Like a Bitch , it was cool for awhile , till the radio started playing it constantly and people started singing it when someone is complaining . 
< PROPFIRST > Ripley is gonna suck < PROPFIRST > Fisher's < PROPMALE > so hard he jizzes rainbows and craps unicorns . 
Fucking sitting around and playing < PROPFIRST > , like a bawse . 
Some of the flesh on my right wrist was taken off when I was moving couches earlier . Real men slit their wrists with furniture . 
\Adam Lambert is the pied < PROPFEMALE > for fags 
BAM , the soap has been dropped . 
Burned alot of the hair off my hand while playing with a lighter , thank goodness my palm hair is fine . 
You're all cooooooooooooooooooocks . 
Got the new KoRn album today , not what I was expecting , but still awesome . 
Bought some superglue today , by the end of the week , things are going to be glued to other things they shouldn't be glued to . 
Argh , wearing black jeans because all my blue jeans have huge holes in them .

Disney's Tangled looks great , totally gonna watch it . The name change seems unnecessary though , I think most(if not all ) people that'll watch it as \Tangled\ " would watch it as \ " Rapunzel \"."

Ohey that treehouse I went to recently was apparently the world's largest . It was built by this crazy shit that said God told him to do it , apparently . Can't see why anyone would want it , let alone a deity . 
Holy fuck it feels like I've been drinking nails and one got stuck in my throat .
