Ya know , when a man works hard his entire life enduring hundreds of ladies , many of whom he does not even remember you'd like to think that at the end of the day he will be given a lot of money , without having had to earn it . 
Even though they lost at least the Cougs were compettive . Our time will come . GO COUGS 
Damn Stealers !! 
So yesterday I said I was going to put 25$ while in Vegas on the cougs . I forget to do it and why happens ? Cougs in but u know what I . Don't care Go cougs ! 
Had a great weekend ! Was In Vegas cougs won and hawks won . The only way it could be better Is if I didn't have to leave 
I hate my car . I should probably look for a second job cuz I'll never be able to afford any other way 
Had a productive day did some yard work and cleaned the house
