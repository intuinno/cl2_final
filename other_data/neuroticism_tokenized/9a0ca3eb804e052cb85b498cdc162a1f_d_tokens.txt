Message to all females : I think its high time we stepped our cookies up , and locked our cookie jars up real tight bcuz i've come to the realization that although we may think that boys are stupid , they're actually quite smart ( sneaky ) when it comes to girls ... really smart . 
Words can not express how disgusted I am by what you did =/ 
Ouch ! when i actually take time and think about what you did i relize that it really did hurt , but even worse than tht I realize that if the roles were switched i probably wouldnt have the guts to hurt you like u did me . 
I forgot to tell you that your laugh is freakn contagious ?

Never idealize others . They will never live up to your expectations . 
So I know I'm nice and all , but when you test me like this , and do all this extra & unecessary sh*t , please do not think , not even for a second , that I won't do anything about it ... Because chances are I will do something about it , and I can promise you that if I do , you won't like it !
