Cheers to a new year ... and here's to hoping we get it right . <3 

Store with < PROPFEMALE > to pick up a few things , text me . <3 
Leftovers and Days of Our Lives . <3 
Heading to North Conway with the family to buy a new digital camera ;) text me if you want me . <3 
I'm finally at a place where I'm content with things in my life . I hope it lasts , but I know it won't . It's funny how the little things can make you so happy . 
Hiding in my room , safe within my womb . I touch no one , and no one touches me . I am a rock , I am an island . And a rock feels no pain , and an island never cries . 
Birthday lunch for < PROPFEMALE > with the family , be back later . txt . <3 
TV : ( waiting on Law & Order : SVU at ten ) what a life . Miss my guy . <3 
I hate this incredibly uneasy feeling I have that's making it so I can't sleep .. 
This Facebook stuff is kind of ridiculous -- I swear it never does what I tell it to . Grrrr . 
Sweet disposition , never too soon . Oh , reckless abandon like no one's watching you . A moment , a love , a dream , a laugh , a kiss , a cry , our rights , our wrongs , and while our blood's still young ( it's so young ) , it runs , and we won't stop ' till it's over--won't stop to surrender . 
This is me , damn it . I look the way I look , ( not going to change ) think the way I think , feel the way I feel , love the way I love . I am a whole complex package . Take me or leave me . Accept me or walk away . Don't try to make me feel like less of a person , just because I don't fit your idea of who I should be ... If I need to change , I alone will make that decision . 
\I cannot believe that the inscrutable universe turns on an axis of suffering ; surely the strange beauty of the world must somewhere rest on pure joy . \"" 
Can't wait for it to be Wednesday , to be in Boston (!) . I feel like I reeeaaallyyy need to get out . So bored , might take a nap ... txt . <3 
Still need to pack , putting it off as long as possible .. BOSSSTTONNN . <3 and I hope I see you , < PROPFIRST > . :) Text me if you wanna get ahold of me for the next couple of days ( cell number on < PROPFEMALE > if you dun have it ) . 
Right now there's a police officer helping \ 
someone . A police officer is working the streets ( day or night ) to keep \ 
you safe . A police officer is missing their family while caring for \ 
yours . In the minute it took you to read this , police officers all over \ 
the world are saving lives . It's Police Officer Appreciation week , \ 
repost if you are a police officer , love a police officer or appreciate a\ 
police officer . 
S'mores at 2 in the morning . Because I can . 
All I can say is that my life is pretty plain , I like watchin ' the puddles gather rain . And all I can do is just pour some tea for two , and speak my point of view , but it's not sane . I just want someone to say to me ' I'll always be there when you wake . ' Ya know I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today , so stay with me and I'll have it made . 
New phone ! Text it up . 1-207-239-6362 <3 
Ugh . Not feeling so smashing ; I can't shake this freaking cold . 
The clouds are a perfect shade of pink , with the sun rising this morning .. <3

If yellow roses grow in heaven , \ 
Lord , pick a bunch for me\

Place them in my dad's arms and tell him they're from me\ 
Tell him that I love him , and when he turns to smile \ 
Place a kiss upon his cheek and hold him for awhile\ 
Because remembering him is easy , \ 
I do it everyday ... \ 
There's an ache within my heart that will never go away . \

They painted your secrets with the lies they told to you , and the least they ever gave you was the most you ever knew . Your voice is small and fading and you hide in here unknown , and your mother loves your father ' cause she's got nowhere to go . They press their lips against you , and you love the lies they say , and I tried so hard to reach you but you're falling anyway . 
Who do I miss the most ? The friends I let go of , or the friends that let go of me ?

In my eyes , indisposed , in disguise as no one knows , hides the face , lies the snake\ 
in the sun in my disgrace . Boiling heat , summer stench , ' neath the black the sky looks dead , stuttering , cold and damp , steal the warm wind tired friend . In my shoes , a walking sleep , and my youth I pray to keep . Heaven send Hell away , no one sings like you anymore . Black hole sun , won't you come , and wash away the rain ? 
I'm so tired right now , I don't even know if I know how tired I really am . Large iced coffee , other caffeinated beverages ... none of it is working ! Quick , throw me the jumper cables . I would much rather be eating cupcakes with Gabby < PROPMALE > , anyway . :D <3

Family outing ? Heck yes , NH here I come . <3 Back later . 
Sometimes what is shattered and glued back together is more strong and beautiful than before it was broken . 
really hates mindgames . Everyone seems to play them , and they're not cute . I f*ck with my own head enough -- I don't need anymore help . Thanks . 
We used to think it was impossible , now you call me by my new last name - memories seem like so long ago . Time always kills the pain . We have changed , but we're still the same . I'll be happy for you if you can be happy for me ; circles and triangles , and now we're hangin ' out with your new girlfriend . So far from where we've been ... \ 
I know we're cool .

Under skinned knees and the skid marks\ 
Past the places where you used to learn\ 
You howl and listen\ 
Listen and wait for the\ 
Echoes of angels who won't return\ 
You're waiting for someone\ 
To put you together\ 
You're waiting for someone to push you away\ 
There's always another wound to discover\ 
There's always something more you wish he'd say 
I have an angel named < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , I swear - always helping me see things clearly and helping clean up my messes . Lylas , ho bear ! <3

Please put this on your status if you know or love someone who is gay . My wish\ 
is that people will understand that being gay is not a disease nor is it a \

Whatever doesn't kill you only makes you stronger , stranger and much less sensitive . 
\We wear the mask that grins and lies

All that I take with me is all you've left behind\ 
We're sharing one eternity , living in two minds\ 
Linked by an endless thread , impossible to break 
Like reflections on the < PROPFEMALE > , the world's what you create . 
11 hours of sleep , countless tissues later and I'm wishing that this monster cold from Hell would go away - I almost never get sick , what is this ? Rawr ... 
has been spending the day with a few of the people she loves most . Thank you everyone for the birthday wishes so far , but especially to < PROPFEMALE > Batchelder and < PROPFIRST > Powell for going out of their way to make sure it was really special for me - I appreciate it more than you know . Love you guys . <3 And on top of that ... Woot , I am now 17 . Damn right . ;) 
has spent all today looking for a cute outfit to wear tomorrow , this being one of the only times she actually has money on her ... mission failed . ' Eff it . Gonna watch Resident Evil , Resident Evil : Apocalypse , and Resident Evil : Extinction - all in a row . <3 Text . 
Happy Thanksgiving , everyone ! :D 
I don't need a microphone , yeah , to say what I been thinking - my heart is like a loudspeaker that's always on eleven . And if you strip me ... what would you find ? If you strip me , strip it all away , I'm still the same . Take what you want , steal my pride , build me up , or cut me down to size . Shut me out ... but I'll just scream . I'm only one voice in a million - but you ain't taking that from me . 
wouldn't have to manage her anger if certain people would learn how to manage their stupidity . 
Friends are seperated by priorities , distances , differences and pride ; no matter what comes between us , I'll always be the friend you've known from the start ... I promise . 
Life is like a rollercoaster - you can either squeeze your eyes shut and hold on tight until it's over , or let go and throw your hands up in the air ... and scream . \\o/ <3 
I see my vision burn , I feel my memories fade with time , but I'm too young to worry . A < PROPFEMALE > , a memory , or just one picture ... 
\She shuts the doors and lights and lays her body on the bed / Where images and words are running deep / She has too much pride to pull the sheets above her head / So quietly she lays and waits for sleep . \"" 
No rest for the wicked . * sigh * 
Really , -really- wish that I could say that today was better , but at least my mom is okay . Thanks , God - maybe you really are watching out ... but try not to take her away from me anytime soon . I still need her , and probably always will . If you could ease up on us , that'd be a great help , too ... 
I'm bored , so why not ... message me with your < PROPFIRST > , 1 - 1 , 000 , and I'll give you some completely honest feedback . :) No fake BS .

Unfortunately , I don't really know you all that well - you and my sister were better friends than you and I were , but still , I think you're overall a pretty cool person , and I wouldn't mind seeing you again , it's been a very , very long time . Lol . I'm not even sure how long ... most likely back when we lived in that area , which was years ago ... I hope you've been doing well , and stuff , though . :) 
0 :\ 
Always breaking rules , lol . You're one of my very favorite people in this world , and I love you to death ; I don't think I could live without your friendship , and I mean that , 100% . We may have our fights , but we always bounce back and are stronger because of it . It's just a shame that this damn thing won't let me write more , rawr ! <3

I love you , plain and simple . You're one of my truest friends and always have been , and I'm determined to be just as close as we used to be . I think I'm gonna go insane if we don't < PROPFEMALE > out soon , I miss you ... That and you owe me about a million hugs that you need to make up for , sir ! <3 
999 :\ 
Lol , we go way back ... so glad we started talking again , and that we're even talking more than we used to . I know I have a reliable friend in you , and you're probably one of the nicest guys I know ... you're always surprising me with what you say . Your sense of humor is awesome , as well . xD 
21 :\ 
You're hands down the coolest younger person I know , you're so different from the rest , and I'm very happy to have met you . You're my woodcutting < PROPMALE > , haha . I knew from the moment I saw you I wanted to make you my friend , if I'm being completely honest , here . :) 
Hey , Winter : I don't really like you . Yeah , we were tight when I was younger , but I have since grown , so take your white sh*t and frigid temperatures and get lost so I can be warm again . That being said , g'night , everyone ! 
Think I'll make something of myself today - no sense in being bummed out over people who never had the right to make you suffer in the first place . He's not even worth my time . \ 
Last-minute Christmas shopping with mother dearest later ... <3 At least the stores'll be warm . 
Take me home to a house on a hill , in oblivion\ 
Where souls ever die all alone\ 
You're longing for love , not sympathy\ 
So take away this shadow over me 
Everyone needs to wish my best friend in the entire world , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , a happy birthday ! Do it , people ! Love you , girly . <3 :) 
Managed to drag myself outta bed for a little while today after sleeping since two in the afternoon , yesterday ... Ugh , don't know what's wrong , feel like crap ... Would love to hear from < PROPFIRST > Thompson and/or < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > ... Text me . <3

You were all I loved of what I lost , but know that I miss you ... 
You could take me higher , so you said - I trusted you . \ 
I may be a liar , but betrayal lies on you . 
Where were you when everything was falling apart ? \ 
All my days were spent by the telephone that never rang\ 
And all I needed was a call that never came\ 
Lost and insecure , you found me , you found me\ 
Lying on the floor , surrounded , surrounded\ 
Why'd you have to wait ? Where were you ? Where were you ? \ 
Just a little late , you found me , you found me\ 
Why'd you have to wait ... to find me ... to find me ? 
I'm so tired of men acting like little boys ; if you claim to be such a man , you should act like one . ' Nuff said .
