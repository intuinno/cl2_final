uhhh my roommate and her friend moved around the beds and stuff while i was gone yesterday >.> i'm so studying in the study room with my laptop and stuff now on ... room only for sleeping and changing stuff x-x oh yeah deleted voldy from her facebooks xD 
who would've thought reading medical books and biology stuff on my free time would help , I tutored a pre-nursing student on human biology . I've never even read her book ( I read other medical books similar though xD ) , wow ... I just hope that she does well in class with my help and that I do well by being able to tutor someone else in my classes . And that we both get into our medical school/nursing schools :) 
loves her Best Friends <3 , College Friends and Family :) I appreciate you ^_^ and I miss you too :\\ and I put a medical school logo as my computer's background to help me keep focus in college even though I do miss my best friends and family 
the average U.S undergrad grad rate is 5-6 years I want to graduate in 4 years ... so I may enter med school at 21 years old . My college doesn't have all the science classes that i need every year , so I will grad at 5 years . Graduate at the national average or Grad before ... IDK I love HNU but Hawaii is where I want to practice medicine and go to medical school . Residency - that will depend on my specialty xD

Why can't I get over someone that doesn't treat me well , but yet I still care about them as if a part of me is still with them and my heart can't let that go . I wish I can just get over them but at the same time I wish I can at least talk to them more , IDK ... love sucks but friends and family make life worthwile <3 :) 
Is almost over you ... :) Thank You best friends , College friends , Jamba friends , my roommate and everyone for their help in getting me over ex-best friend , by the time winter break comes around and I go home !!! :D I should be over her :) YEY !!! Time for family and friends that matter coming first again , and my dreams coming too not just her :) ([ Best ] Friends <33 , Music and College really helped )

Thank You for being there for me everyoone ^_^ and lets all < PROPFEMALE > out during Christmas and Summer Breaks in Hawaii !!! :D :) 
Here's my resolution I'm letting go All I need to learn is along this road And I just want to be the best person I can be Breathe , it's my resolution 
Turns 18 in less than 3 weeks :D November 9th , 2009 :) but can't vote cause my birthday is a few days after election day x_x 
Needs to Vent ...... on a note on facebook xD 
I think I need more facebooks xD to accomadate all my best friends to have a display picture with me on my facebook proflies :) I put some of my best friends because I do < PROPFEMALE > my friendship , I'm blessed to have met and be friends with such wonderful friends as you . Thank you for all that you do by just being you :D I'm happy to watch all of my best friends ( girls and guys ) Grow and learn ^_^ 
HATES BUGS AND MAINLAND PEOPLE WHO ARE IMMATURE AND STUPID ..... I hate big scary bugs 
BLASTING SIMPLE PLAN XDDDDD Rock Music always make me feel better when I was yelled at ..... especially simple plan , green day , etc :) 
music soothes the soul .... enough rock songs time for happy songs :)

Without them I wouldn't be where I am at now <3 Thank You , there aren't enough thank you's in the world to tell how much I apprecaite my real and true friends that are in my life . Music is helping me feel better - < PROPFEMALE > Aguilera The Voice Within , < PROPFEMALE > Duff Fly and Miley < PROPMALE > The Climb :) 
4000 Word Biology Research Paper : Started ... Due Nov 4th Weds , More writing to go x_x These are the days where I rather be taking notes or doing labs :( I'm thinking about getting my MPH before applying to medical school though :) More Eduacation !!!! xD 
In two years , I want to transfer Home to Chaminde University :) 
In two years , I want to transfer Home to Chaminde University :) on the condition , that I dorm cause then I'll study better xD and get better grades 
Is debating to transfer to Chaminde ( on the condition that I dorm , with a single room - for academic reasons xD ) because they offer all the < PROPMALE > requirement science classes that I need every year which my current college doesn't offer as much and Is VERY HOMESICK right now :( I miss you , My Hawaii <3 
I'm thinking of Transferring to Chaminde University of Honolulu for Sophmore year , It'll give me enough time to know the professors , but Idk most Biology majors take 4.5 - 5 years to graduate anyways cause of the GE classes and all the sciences <3 that Biology/Science majors have to take ..... I'm still debating x_x 
:) 
It's funny the hardest class for a freshmen - Biology ( the sciences & Kind of Math ) are fun and I understand it pretty good but the easiest - English , Sociology classes are hard ( grade-wise ) for me . It's always been like this even high school . Chemistry was the hardest but fun and okay with me . English I always sucked at writing but not reading and poetry WEIRD x_x 
My college says I ( and my parents ) owe them 6440$ , they said they sent my parents a < PROPMALE > and they haven't recieved my student loans , which I just took out >.< I'M PISSED AT MY COLLEGE my parents kept asking me when they will get a < PROPMALE > .... they never recieved it yet O.O stupid HOLY NAMES UNIVERSITY SO FRIKEN DISORGANIZED PEOPLE 
in a few day I turn 18 so does Lyra Dimapasoc :) and My roommate < PROPFEMALE > Apel turns 19 :D November 9th Birthdays xD

is going to try sleep good tonight :) and finish her biology research project before 8pm tommorow hopefully :3 as long as it's before the front desk closes . I just gotta do the lab-like part for the project x_x 
I couldn't sleep but 6 days and counting until Lyra Dimapasoc and I turn 18 and My roommate < PROPFEMALE > Apel turns 19 November 9th Birthdays :D 
Slept well last night :) it must have been the biology project finally getting done and now to the regular essays that I have to write XD I think I have one more project for that class though for ecology x_x 
I'm finally getting over my ex-best friend playing the songs I used to play have no effect on me anymore :D they are getting annoying now xD I'm happier and have good people around me that make my life great I love you all <3 ^_^ 
I wish I went on the LIFE retreat instead of ...... but If I transfer to Chaminde I do get that < PROPMALE > again because they are Marinist and they make the LIFE team retreats :) 
Got a bad grade on her collections project and is redoing it ( and the extra credit ) even though redoing it won't affect her grade .... I just want to redo it to show him I can do it :) 
I'm mad at bio ... I can't think now .... not doing biology stuff until Saturday or Sunday :) 
I WANT MY BIO GRADE TO GO UP >.< 
Is sick ... on her birthday week x_x :(

Hopefully the financal aid gets my < PROPFEMALE > money by Monday but denfinately Weds :) Monday so my registration goes through would be preferred xD 
I want Thanksgiving and Christmas Break already !! :) 
thinks people who party , drink and have sex at HNU are immature and stupid to ruin my door just cause I called the RA on duty and had a wonderful thanksgiving and black friday with < PROPFEMALE > , her family , < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE > :) 
I can't wait for Christmas so I can be home with my family and friends back home again :) and New Year's < PROPFEMALE > and Day so I can start the year anew . I realized I'm becoming more Monque by the day , I don't even go into Hollister , A&F , AE anymore xD if I do I don't buy anything ( black friday helped ) . It just wasn't me and never will be , what I like to wear t-shirt and jeans and department store brands are good for me

Sometimes we are so focused on our dreams and goals that we forget to LIVE and ENJOY life along the way especially with college/school , pressure to succeed and loving and being who you are in a society that wants the opposite . \There are only two ways to live your life . One is as though nothing is a miracle . The other is as though everything is a miracle . \ " :) "

I have learned two lessons in my life : first , there are no sufficient literary , psychological , or historical answers to human tragedy , only moral ones .

Peace is something that is hard to find when the mind wonders fighting the feelings that are more real then we care to admit . The true peace comes when we finally allow ourselves to feel that emotion and trust in the Lord that it is to fulfill His purpose in redeeming us . ~ wayward son

My heart wants to specialize in oncology over pediatrics , family medicine ( general medicine ) and emergency medicine ( ER ) as cancer research advances , I can help make a difference in other's lives because cancer affected me as well . I can relate better to the patients and their family . 
is giving up soda for lent and going to mass tommorow for lent to celebrate finishing her bio test :D 
To Bio test and Lab intresting < PROPFEMALE > lab today though XD Compound Mircoscope time !!! Lent :) No soda for 40 days !! I've read bio so many times , my brain is like I get it already XD 
really wants to go home to hawaii or get my own dorm room w/out a roommate ..... 
Allergy Season is here ..... so that means lots of bugs and pollen x_x I hope that don't get too many allergy attacks @@ 
My sister's keeper reminds me of my mom and brother , especially make a wish foundation :( I needed to take a break to play \Just stand up ( to cancer)\ " so I won't cry during the movie . Leukemia what my brother had is one of the hardest cancers to fight but my mom's lung cancer would have a greater survival rate then it was in 1996 . " 
No one knows how precious life is until their health is lost , people often don't know what they have until their last moments of their life . Live everyday as if it were your last , < PROPFEMALE > loved ones , best friends and memories . Don't be afraid of dying but accept that Life is only as great and precious as you think it is :) 
Success is ninety-nine percent mental attitude . It calls for love , joy , optimism , confidence , serenity , poise , faith , courage , cheerfulness , imagination , initiative , tolerance , honesty , humility , < PROPFEMALE > , and enthusiasm . - < PROPMALE > Peterson 
wants to become a Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Doctor :) because I have to go through internal medicine/Pediatrics residency to get into an Hematology ( blood)/Oncology ( cancer ) Fellowship anyways plus Pediatrics was my original plan . But I want to figure out the genetic mutation in my family's DNA too : x 
well at least I Know what to study for Bio 1A .... I don't like my grade on the test :( almost like repeat of Bio 1B x_x except I actually do like 1A stuff I do not like Plants 
Will do better on the next Biology test , I'm aiming for a A ( I really need one ) or B . Besides essays , I'm going to read Biology , answer the study guide and explain it as much detail as possible while try to understand the concepts . I will do better on the next 3 test !! 
LOVES HAWAII <3 
home makes me happy :) or at least listening to hawaiian music and watching videos filmed in Hawaii 
what happened to patient care ? it seems like health care now is just what the insurance companies or what the government whats ....... >.< 
misses home :( 
Hawaii I'm Yours <3 :) 
Obstacles cannot crush me . Every obstacle yields to stern resolve . He who is fixed to a < PROPFEMALE > does not change his mind . < PROPFIRST > Covey 
hates her college and wants to go home now !!!! 
has a PRIVATE FACEBOOK FOR A REASON = PRIVATE LIFE >.< 
blocking people = fun for < PROPFEMALE > on this facebook XD I wish I were at home at the beach eating a loco moco , watching the sunset and being with my family right now :( 
Missing home so much she is listening to 105 KINE , Oldies 107.9 and 102.7 the bomb online depending on the song , she picks which station mostly Hawaiian music <3 :) 
deleted a lot of my college classmates from my other facebook I enjoy a private life I might delete more later .... xD don't worry besties always stay ( I won't delete my best friends ) :) I've been sleeping all day , I guess I am really exhausted x_x back to english hw and speech . I'll do bio and math the whole week after finishing the \easy\ " hw . " 
wishes she was in Hawaii <3 :( 
wants local food from back home <3 L&L hawaiian barbacue trip tommorow :D Yummy ~ 
Tired of people asking for help when only exams come around .... there are tutors and professors to help you at this small college NOT JUST ME . I have a life , other classes too besides pre-calculus and biology to think about . I WANT TO BE HOME :( 
has a creeper for a roommate GREAT -_- RESTRAINING ORDER please ? 
so roommate walked in while bf and I were watching movie and eating in the dorm room = damage control time because of the nosy roommate 
Done with financial stuffs ~ :) Now to study more Biology , just 6 more questions on the study guide to do ( by hand - I got tired of typing and finding it plus they are shorter answers then the ones I typed x_x ) , Do Bio , Pre-Cal and English Homework and Practice my Communcations Speech a little ( even though I know the subject really well ;) Health care ! ) :D Productive and FUN break :D 
If you are trying to text me , I cannot text you back until my dad pays the phone < PROPMALE > . So my cell phone is useless at the moment except for games . I can recieve calls and texts but I am not able to call out and text back/out . I'm sorry if you thought I was ignoring you or caused any problems . Hopefully my G1 will back to normal soon : x 
How come I have an easier time telling my ex-best friend how I feel then I do with my boyfriend ? How come I write my feelings to her so easily but once it comes to my boyfriend I don't know how to ? Why is my heart so scared , but not as scared with the one who broke my heart ? 
Only can recieve calls and texts but cannot call or text back/out at the moment . So if you just call me , I'll answer but texts I cannot answer any at the moment 
To comfirmation class , then Fallacy Assignment and study more Biology first and do the rest of my pre-cal homework . Hopefully math quiz is delayed cause of the class being cancelled on Friday right b4 spring break :) then I can concentrate on Bio first , Pre-cal After :D 
is exhausted 
comfirmation rehersals , essays to do , math homework and quizzes and a biology test to start to study for ..... what fun , I hope that I don't get too exhausted before the end of the semester @@ . I'm thankful for my best friends : < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , Lyra , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPMALE > and Teejay and my co-workers best friends < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > and Jilly <3 ^_^

I'm thankful for God and Life today ^_^ for Easter Vigil , I don't have a white shirt , pants and something nice to wear . So some nice people at the church are letting me borrow a dress , white t-shirt and shorts . And they know Hawaii's Bishop < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > - Small world :) THANK YOU GOD <3

Wants to sleep for the whole weekend 
If one desires a change , one must be that change before that change can take place . < PROPFEMALE > Bellin 
What's worse loosing someone you love because you want them to be happy or telling them the truth and giving them advice to something they don't want to hear or won't enjoy hearing ? I've done both , so let's see where this Journey takes me as I climb through the last 3 weeks of Freshmen year in College . 
I cannot text or go online on my cellphone yet again until the < PROPMALE > is paid ( My 3G on my phone is gone ) so I cannot call out , respond to text messages but I can recieve calls and texts until my 3G comes back ..... I'm sorry for the inconvience it causes if you are trying to contact me or wait for my response . 
I want you to see , I need something more , Than you gave me for . I want you to burn . I want you to steal . I want you to bleed , And see how it feels . I want you to beg , I want you to crawl . Give more than you take , And smile through it all . And know that everything you do , I do it for you . - I do it for you , < PROPMALE > Lachey 
Helping others by giving advice even if it is through Facebook Comments on statuses , Help me Make my day !! :D I love helping others ^_^ If I see/read a sad , upset , hurt , etc ... facebook status those are the ones I like to comment on the most , Benefit of being my FB friend , classmate and people on here Family and Best Friends ? I love you all :) 
Hopes that after Lab and the Bio test tommorow that I get enough sleep !! 
If I could have < PROPFEMALE > back in my life I would , but we both need time apart ( as I am enjoying this freedom ) . I am not ready it still hurts , the memories aren't completely gone and I need time to just be me with My Best Friends ? , Family and Friends . She might want me back ...... But I am not ready and don't think she has learned , grown up and loves herself yet . 
Note to self : Never speak of , write or talk anything related to hell year ..... the memories and pain will come back . Other years including senior year is less painful but be careful when speaking in detail . Yes < PROPFEMALE > Cried like Hell year today :'( Pain like no other except losing my Mom and Brother 
Time apparently hasn't healed my broken heart , it still feels like it did during hell/the unbareable year but at least I can handle it better , it hurts less than it did a little :( 
Apparently Not doing homework today ..... I guess tommorow . Finish email to someone ASAP then back to homework :) 
Feels better after writing the novel to and sent it through email so she could understand our past friendship , hell year and senior year more . It is a novel 10 MB email with 45 KB in attachements . Now I can Concentrate on my Education and enjoy the Bay Area while I can :D 
Wisdom is one thing , to know how to make true judgment , how all things are steered through all things . Heraclitus 
Looking up more Love songs :) on YouTube later and playing as many 90s songs as I can :D I can't wait to go home <3 but will miss < PROPMALE > Washington , Lyra Dimapasoc , < PROPFEMALE > Navat and < PROPFIRST > Griffin Kramer when I leave for Hawaii and don't come back :( 
Is sleeping for WEEK once I am home in Hawaii . So exhuasted and tired :(( 
FREAKING OUT :( 
feels crappy .... 
Love is patient , love is kind . It is not jealous , ( love ) is not pompous , it is not inflated , it is not rude , it does not seek its own interests , it is not quick-tempered , it does not brood over injury , it does not rejoice over wrongdoing but rejoices with the truth . It bears all things , believes all things , hopes all things , endures all things . Love never fails . - 1 Corinthians 13 ; 5-8 
Love is patient , love is kind and is not jealous ; love does not brag and is not arrogant , does not act unbecomingly ; it does not seek its own , is not provoked , does not take into account a wrong suffered , does not rejoice in unrighteousness , but rejoices with the truth ; bears all things , believes all things , hopes all things , endures all things . Love never fails - 1 Corinthians 13 ; 5-8 NASB Translation 
Sometimes I wish I was superman like in Smallville , have all his awesome powers except that Krptonite weakness thing can go . 
You're so Yesterday , I'm just a bird that's already flown away ( not to my boyfriend ) :) Thank you < PROPFEMALE > Duff for your hit single \So Yesterday\ " :D " 
Who would thought Bitching at someone can be so much fun , don't worry I'm not a Bitch just saying Having fun expressing my anger until I calm down sometime this weekend :) 
I can't wait to block someone's number on Friday ..... its no one here on this facebook or any of mine :) I guess I am really pissed at what happened 3 years ago >:) 
Is Done with My Ex-Best Friend :) I'm over her and blocking all contact with her as much as possible including cell phone . 
Due to stupid/immature/not well informed people on my other facebook excuse my language but : FUCK MY EX-BEST FRIEND , I DON'T GIVE A SHIT and FUCK HER . ( the reason why this is on this facebook - this stays within this facebook ONLY ) 
what's really on my mind ? it's 3am I haven't finished my take home english final , and my 8-10 < PROPFEMALE > essay . How will get enough sleep for an 11am class and 1:30 class ? Why are people so immature , disrespectful and stupid ? Why don't people get I didn't say do anything to her ? Why can't people understand what I went through ? UHHHHHH SOOOOO STRESSSSSSS OOUTT D: 
ALL NIGHTER this morning < PROPFEMALE > ? YES YOU HAVE 8-10 < PROPFEMALE > essay and FINAL TO DO . FUCK >.< DAMN I hope I can drink Coffee oh well COKE WILL DO , PLUS COKE IS AWESOME :) 
YOU'RE SO YESTERDAY 
After being used , yelled at/bitched at , mistreated , taken for granted , felt as if I were nothing , gave up everything for and meant nothing and got so bad one year that I was at the point of killing myself and would've done it too . You Don't think I'm PISSED at the person who got me to that point in my life ? FUCK YEAH I AM without her ever in my life is so much better . 
NEEDS TO WRITE A RANT before she can calm down but blocking her number will help :) 
Here's my resolution ; I'm letting go ; All I need to learn is along this road ; And I just wanna be the best person I can be ; Breathe , it's my resolution - Resolution ( < PROPMALE > Lachey ) - supposed to say I just wanna be the best MAN I can be , I'm not a guy =_= so I changed the lyrics LOL 
Here's my resolution ; I'm letting go ; All I need to learn is along this road . As move on , I take the scar , pain and memories with me . To love deeply as I do is to also risk real deep pain of a broken heart but I can live with it , I won't forget the lessons I've learned from it as I move onto the future . The Scar is Deep but Love still remains . 
Is going to have my own \Party in the USA\ " once Voldy's < PROPFIRST > are blocked from my cellphone . FREEDOM !!!!!!!! :D If I do need to Vent More it will be in My Venting Note :) It's going to be a \ " Party in the USA\ " XD " 
Is sounding stupid on her other facebook to see who is actually taking me Seriously . My Randomness is for entertainment of who acutally thinks is < PROPFEMALE > that dumb ? NOPE just keeping the drama away from myself :) So IGNORE MY OTHER FB STATUSES ATM 
and any Math don't go together like water and oil . Any Science and even Humanites course go together well for her though espeically Natural Sciences . Weird , Science and Math are Best Friends , but I have more a conceptual mind in Science then analytical mind that's needed for math . 
My Finals are coming up : Thurs 5/6 Communications , Friday 5/7 Online Multi-Choice Pre-Cal Final and Monday 5/10 Bio 1A Final . I miss Hawaii <3 The food , the nice people , the weather , the hospitals and Best Friends and Family . I will miss my Bay Area Friends , I hope that I can see you all again :) 
< PROPFEMALE > : What goes around comes around . Catches up fast if you have bulit up so much bad < PROPFEMALE > but if it's all good < PROPFEMALE > No Worries :) Remember that the truth will always come out in the end . Live Everyday as if it is your last , because you never what you have until it's gone/too late . 
People often don't know what they have until it's gone but by that time , it could be too late . The person moved on with their life ; the events already happened , the choice was made . All they can do is move on as I choose to do ( if you read my new FB note ) 
is going to live the life she wants to live , by cherishing every moment of everyday with love ones around her . Spend time volunteering , reading and doing anatomy/chemistry , enjoying the beauty of Hawaii and spending time with all of those whom I love . <3 JUST BE ME 
MATH SUCKS but science is awesome :) 
< PROPMALE > Washington and I walked UC Berekely campus ( 1,600 acres\ 
with central campus 200 acres ) 2 times :D we are awesome , so is the \ 
mansion Life Sciences Building on campus I wanna go inside the labs and\ 
lecture halls !!!! :) I love my Bears hat from outside the campus XD 
Freezing cold shower in a Freezing cold place ( the Bay Area ) cause that's such a good combination =_= thank you HNU . At least it woke me up and wasted less water LOL XD 
I wish finals were over ... well just Bio final to go :D and I wish the heater would work and the showers had working hot water >.< I'm tired of being cold at night D: Makes me wanna go home faster 
Ever wonder how long it takes to change your life ? What measure of time \ 
is enough to be life-altering ? Is it four years , like high school ? One \ 
year ? An eight-week walking tour ? Can your life change in a month , or a \ 
week , or a single day ? We're always in a hurry to grow up , to go places , \ 
to get ahead ... but when you're young , one hour can change everything . 
The California Academy of Scinces Museum , San < PROPFEMALE > , Japantown and Spending time with < PROPMALE > Washington on his Birthday :D today is a Great Day !!! And a Celebration that Freshmen year of College is done = SUMMER in HAWAII <3 
probably going to sleeping for a week once I\ 
get home . So my status is \Sleeping\ " and \ " Busy\ " for a next few weeks of\

Uhhh Parents are they made to annoy and stress me out for no reason . Sophmore year of college hasn't even started yet >.> 
Uhhh Parents are they made to annoy and \ 
stress me out for no reason . Sophmore year of college hasn't even \ 
started yet >.> being a first generation college student sucks .... maybe transfer to UH later . Med/Grad school not going to like my many transfers although they are all for financial reasons >.< 
Can wait until June !!! ( and for my gums to \ 
heal from wisdom teeth removal ) :D To Volunteer at QMC hopefully , might \

One Tree Hill reruns on Soapnet remind me why I used to like watching the show so much on WB before it went to CW . Reminds me of who I was before upperclassmen years , I love the quotes in the TV series . 
So my aunt thinks that drinking milk will make my armpits smell like cow , otherwords she's implying if I drink from a cow I will smell like one . I guess I shouldn't eat steak , beef or any form of meat either by her reasoning >.> and She thinks I haven't \grown up\ " since I went away to college " 
Total fan moment while up watching the early show : I sang along with the backstreet boys , idk the \this is us\ " album though xD lol " 
Someone get me claratin before I end up in the hospital ER !! >.< I really don't like my ex-best friend ..... she sucks 
So ... since like every hospital summer positions are filled I'll just volunteer during the school year during my easy class days only since I have chem MWF and lab F . My backup plan now is to overshadow a physician , too late to get a job here to work for 2 months , NO I WON'T WORK AT JAMBA ... I'm sorry don't like jamba anymore since I work there :( 
I want to overshadow a physician , < PROPFEMALE > out with friends and my cousin and enjoy hawaii :) while I send in my volunteer application to QMC and HPH early , to volunteer during the school year . 
The only med school I want to go is < PROPFIRST > A Burns School of Medicine at UH Manoa . I love Hawaii , that's the only Med & Grad school I want to go . 
BP stucks .. thank you for contributing to destroying our beautiful earth and burning oil to global warming in CO2 >.> so many pharmaccutical company commericals .... 
The tide is high scene .... now < PROPFEMALE > goes to graduation as she has to give a speech and ruins graduation for < PROPMALE > high - yes plan on me updating on the movie via this FB 
Wow she's failing on her inprov speech and < PROPFEMALE > Falls NOW !!! 
< PROPFEMALE > Vie = a lie and scam to me >.> I've been used before you don't think I research a company before applying and hired/recruited to it .... dumbasses 
I need something medicial .... I think I should ask my first pediatrician ( Dept of Peds Head ) and maybe even my current one to shadow her ( again ) . 
Well if you don't know this already : I'm smarter than I look , I'm stronger than how innocent that I appear to be and I learn from my mistakes and think before I do espcially when dealing with financial matters ( cause I don't want a relaspe of you-know-what again ) . Just cause I look innocent & weak doesn't mean I am . Its kinda fun to play and learn who's just trying to use me . 
So ... I forgot my dentist's office and had to reschedule , I get confused cause it's the same building the dentist I hated when I was little is there .... I always liked my doctors more then my dentists for appointments 
Wow ... some pre-meds and bio majors can be such assholes especially in college but they can still suck in high school not < PROPFEMALE > Ando and < PROPFEMALE > Navat of course :) I'm not included cause I'm not that competitive but I don't give up that easily NO won't be an answer for med school , grad school is part of my plan not just a back up xD 
DON'T CALL OR TEXT ME ..... My Phone bills are 1,700 $ and $500 was my other for T-moblie so if you want to communicate with me do it on Facebook or AIM only . 
Wanting to overshadow a physician in July , Getting my permit , clean up the desk area , getting all the paperwork in for Chaminade , Getting a cheap working cell phone and Spending time with my Best Friends and my cousins over the break . 
Looking back at my JROTC and CAP stuff and sometimes I miss being in Choir too ; I kinda miss being in both of those military things ... I can redo CAP stuff but my heart is still in medicine . I've taken for at least a 2 months break from reading medicine and science everyday extensively .... I guess it's time to go back cause other than my driver's guide , Discovery Health has been giving me medicine lately . 
reminder to self : apply for loans and clean up living room area . x_x Sometimes I wish college was free , then I'd stuck myself in school for life or until I get my Doctor of Medicine degree . 
< PROPFEMALE > applications are a headache and annoying to do every year ..... too bad I have to do this for a while until I graduate from Medical School @@ 
I can and will get a 3.0 - 3.6 GPA for the next semesters at Chaminade University . I will get good grades , I will concentrate on my studies , and I will get straight B to B+ in all my classes especially at least a B in General Chemistry . 
Why is Financial Aid ( Parent Plus and Stafford loans ) such a headache ? x_x This is why I wish college was free .... 
How do we not let the fear of pain keep us from loving someone ? Time may\ 
have healed the wound but the scare of the risk is still there . It's \ 
easier to be numb then to risk feeling the pain that we once felt . I \ 
just want to concentrate on my higher education goals at the \ 
moment .... I'm not ready for a relationship w/ anyone until after or \ 
during medical school . 
This morning at around 2am .... lighting stroke near my apartment building area in Waikiki during the rainstorm ( It sounded like a big boom and flash ) . The electric pole was making a sizzing sound ; the fire and police department came and this morning HECO came to fix whatever was broken . 
Won't date anymore until I finish medical and graduate school first because science , education and medicine is easier than having a relationship while going for my dreams . Now I know why so many pre-meds are single ..... we don't have a time to \have a life \"" 
When we try so hard to hide our emotions especially pain ; Life finds a way even a hard way in a lesson to awaken those emotions for us to feel them instead of hiding , shielding and numbing the pain . That's probably Life's way of saying you can't run from yourself nor the pain forever cause facing them will be more rewarding in the end . 
Freaked out at the main bus stop ( Punchbowl Street ) cause I saw my ex-best friend , weirdly she for real smiled at me when we both were looking in each others ' eyes , she was standing in the area I usually stand in x_x and I bumped into two classmates from < PROPFEMALE > too ( < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > ) in < PROPFEMALE>'s Medical Center .

Wishes people wouldn't go into health care for the money nor prestige . But because that is what they love to do , think that it is worth the sacrifices and long hours and want to help others . 
Financial Aid Loans = Stress to the < PROPMALE > + Parent's nagging for me to do it for them + rushing me . Hello it takes time ....

I can't run from the pain forever , being numb helps me hide away from the pain but facing it makes me stronger . I would rather face it , then be scared to love truly again my whole life . I know that I can handle it and it won't take over my whole life again because the difficulties in life only makes you stronger .

This will sound nerdy but I love overachieving like going the extra mile putting in more work :D this is fun . I'm trying to get most of my work done this weekend , Doing school work is fun xD 
\It takes a strong heart to love . It takes a stronger heart to continue to love after it has been hurt . \"" 
is Very Thankful for all those best friends , friends and classmates from < PROPFEMALE > and college that are there to support me in my dream in becoming an M.D and M.P.H.

It is the impact that you get to make each and everyday that you wake up in your career in whatever it may be . 
Needs a stress reliever this weekend >.< but I'm glad I get to < PROPFEMALE > out with Tennyson < PROPMALE > II on Friday !!! :D before I get busy .... again @@

Busy until Winter break , especially cause of volunteering and October being test month , Nov last < PROPMALE > to bring up grades before finals month , December = Finals . 
Wishes it was Christmas season instead of Halloween because of the feeling of holidays of how everyone is more loving to each other :) if only more of the year would be like that , I only like dressing up as a doctor of Halloween xD a normal scrubs , lab coat and sneakers none of that slutty things EWWWW >.< 
Homework : Lab Notebook due tomorrow and Math Hw due Friday . Exams : Theology and Lab test Thursday , Math Test Friday . One Week ? : Poetry test . Two Weeks from now : Bio test and lab report . Once xmas break is here , I'm volunteering more in the morning , then hanging out/SLEEP after XD 
Fustraited that my classmates would go so low as cheating ( copying my answers ) on our lab test .... I told the professor though who did it . If they want a good grade , do the work for it >.> 
Still Frustrated that my aunt would defend people cheating off my Lab test , that I should've not told the professor , just smiled about it and she doesn't want me to have enemies but enemies are created on their own by the 7 deadly sins in someone's life about others . I have a VERY LOW BS tolerance ...... 
So the cheater , gossips about me behind my back but yet is attached to me like glue during lab and class ..... it's just annoying that she's pre-med too >.> and she doesn't even put in the work to get good grades in her class . 99% of my class is still in High School , it's almost end of 1st semester people !!! GROW UP !!! 
Everytime I volunteer the more I love medicine , the more I want to become a doctor as I see patients in their beds . I love volunteering at < PROPFEMALE>'s maybe work there in the future one day or at least KMCWC :) 
Almost All B in all my classes ( not including the 10 - 15% for participation and attendance except bio ): D now just need to bring my lecture grade up so ... do well on the next test , final , research paper summaries and read the book more ( aka prepare for a random quiz - try to lol ) . It's like my Chem class in HS all over again except it's my GPA 
Every\ 
person has 1000 wishes . A cancer patient only has one : to get better . I\ 
know that 97% will not post this as their status . But , I know that my \ 
friends will be one of the 3% and put this as their status for at least \ 
an hour . This is in honor of those that lost the fight and those \ 
that ... are ... still fighting . 
Ironic much ? It's easy for me to give advice but following in it like believing in myself that I'll get As - Bs in science and mathematics courses is hard for me cause I've never gotten Bs in those classes except one time in Chemistry for the year but GEs it's expected LOL . 
I'm proud to come from < PROPFEMALE > because of my education and the family that I have from the sisters , my classmates , the teachers and administration but even then my kids are going co-ed education for life = Punahou , Iolani , Maryknoll or Public School 
Can't register for class until my financial stuff is all figured out . Even though I know what classes to take ; which are Genetics and Lab , Bio Techniques , Pre-Cal , History ( lower division ) and Religion ( upper division ) Classes . If it all works out I won't have class on Tuesdays ( volunteering purposes time & HW time xD ) & Lab only on Thurs and Friday . 
So I volunteer 8am - 12pm < PROPFEMALE>'s Volunteer Office , 12:30 - 1:50 pm and volunteer again 4pm - 8pm at < PROPFEMALE>'s ER on My 19th Birthday ( Nov 9 ) going to be interesting , So No homework and eat out that day then O.O 
Happy Birthday Lyra Dimapasoc :D We're Both 19 now xD Imagine ... 2 years from drinking jkjk No really my party at 21 will be Sparkling Cider only :) I'm glad that I can type fast to respond to all the Birthday Wishes ^_^ Thank You . I'll be busy volunteering , A class , volunteering and family dinner today though :D 
Loves Volunteering at the ER at QMC , I got to be a Cantonese translator on my first day while training and do other cool stuff :) 
Is going to study hard this weekend to bring up my grades cause really I didn't do well on my religon test but I still should have a B+ average if i do well on finals for every class . Aiming for 3.5 - 3.6 GPA :D 
Q . What does DNA stand for ? \

A . National Dyslexics Association\ 
You know you're a science nerd , when you look up science jokes while studying for a Biology Final :) 
The ER Tech and Nursing staff let me watch a trauma yesterday and how they treat a stroke & accident victim :) it was cool :D if only my mind was more awake to do things .... then I might've had fun transporting patients too but I let the other volunteer do it . 
DONE with Fall semester 2010 !!! :D time to catch up on sleep ..... kind of ( cause I volunteer a lot next week & got JABSOM PBL lecture to attend on Friday ) I'm always busy xD but I like it :) 
Weird , College-level science and math exams don't give me a headache but when I do the practice test for GRE online , I get a headache >.< At least it was the MCAT yet .... O.O 
Loves Volunteering at < PROPFEMALE>'s especially the ER :D I can't want for tomorrow for my problem-based learning and tour at JABSOM :) 
I bumped into a < PROPFEMALE > graduate , who has the same last name as me at JABSOM ; she's a medical student now :D I love JABSOM and volunteering at < PROPFEMALE>'s ^_^ 
2 A's , 3 B's including lab = 3.462 GPA :D I gotta do better aiming for all A's next semester . I got an A in College Algebra after repeating it like 5 times -_- Well I want 3.6 + GPA Next semester would make me Happy :) 
Drove Kapiolani , < PROPMALE > and Kalakaua Home ...... I'm getting better , I think it's just nervous on the wheel but it was fun though :) 
New Year's < PROPFEMALE > with < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > Mathwiz Extrodinare seeing Tron : Legacy , Costco and hanging out with the < PROPFEMALE>'s ER staff volunteering until the New Year :D 2011 Rock My World xD 
Should I be a full-time employee at the theater to make more money or be par t-t ime so I can have somewhat a life during the summer ? I'm not sure .... I just don't want Jamba even though it pays more >.< Some Traumatizing memories still lure in my mind from flashbacks :( 
I can be so hard-headed at times ... I caught late buses before home as long as its not past 10pm & I'm at in alaz . Then we got a problem . 
Getting back in school mode starting tomorrow ; so that means : no life and busy schedule :D at least I have the ER to make everything fun at the end of the week . Sleepover on Next Tuesday with a friend ^^ 
Rain messing up my internet connection >.< lifted weighs today .... must be why I crashed when I got home LOL . I gotta do better in Pre-Cal , at least a quiz every class besides exams can always bring my grade up :D 
Time to get back in the Studying/No Life Habit :D cause I like Good Grades ^^ Well mostly As xD Haha 
the part I don't like most of having my \time of the month\ " is my face breaking out so much more than normal >.< and if anything leaks cause it's just uncomfortable ...... " 
Wants Inspiration to start writing poetry again .... I haven't written a poem for almost a year and a happy/loving poem for almost 2 years D: I've been writing letters more I don't know why >.< 
is learning to love my broken parts of my heart even though the positive/happy parts are easier ; it will help me love myself even the hurt parts for who I am fully once more . Playing songs like Hero , Voice Within and Beautiful Helps though ^^ 
Exams ( I got to study ) American history , Genetics and Biological Techinques . Yey !!! No life :D I got to fix my lab notebook for Bio Techinques too .... oh well as long as I get a C or better but I got to do better on next lab notebook

- < PROPFEMALE > De Angelis 
Punahou Carnival ...... I just want their malasadas xD 
I think I'm sick , my aunt doesn't cover her mouth when she coughs and her bed is next to mine >.< I've been sleeping all day D: 3 exams this week 
Temporary retiring from poetry writing until I can find inspiration , be open and in touch with my feelings/emotions enough to write a poem to satisfy how I feel through free write , but until that day comes again . Long letters , essays and reflections are now my Temporary New way of expressing myself . 
Wants a trip to North Shore ( Waimea Bay ) alone on Saturday to calm my stresses down as the semester becomes more hectic , to enjoy the beauty of the world after 3 exams ( Genetics , Bio Techniques , and American History ) and just contemplate on life and other stuff . 
North shore plans canceled until after rain season :/ cause I don't plan on catching wet on the other side of the island catching the bus But will go to ala moana on Saturday :D and sleep in xD 
is exhausted after being in the ER on Monday , volunteering at the GAR expo and ER . I need to concentrate on my school work though I want As and Bs only !!! x-x 
Whenever I feel down or lose sight of who I am ; < PROPFEMALE > McGuire my childhood memories a show that brings family , friends and morals into life . Sometimes we all just need reminders of the beauty within us and who we are . 
I wish I could just erase the bad flashbacks that I have about my past that I seem to get around this time :/ gives me nightmares D: 
My history professor brought up that in < PROPFEMALE > that most of us all have our basic essentials but having \the brand name\ " item is just to show off . If more people lived humbly instead of wanting the most expensive items ; we might be able to help more people in this world . " 
How does one get rid of nightmares of the past ? Cause mine always seem to haunt me around anniversary/hell year time ; it's been 2 years and even when I make up a \happy dream\ " I wake up by having some kind of nightmare D: trauma much ? I wish I could make my subconscious forget the traumatic years . " 
Had an awesome day volunteering at the ER !!! Met a tripler peds doctor , got talk to patients more and returned money dropped by an internist ; I love getting to know patients :) I think I got a call back to volunteer at HPH's KMCWC too ^^ I started writing poetry again :D in my rhyme everything way .... lol I gotta start somewhere 
Summer Vacation is on my mind .... how many hours do I volunteer ? What should my work schedule be like ? How will I balance volunteering , work and time with all my friends ? Will I get pass the driving test and get my license before Fall 2011 semester ? 
My phone < PROPMALE > hasn't been paid so I am not able to text and call out . No I'm not ignoring you ... its stupid no 4G network . 
I wish my cell phone was working properly so I can reply back to my text at 9am >.> I'm so very sorry Sister in SD <3 for the extremely late text back , you know if it was working .... I'd text back as fast as I can type on a touch screen phone . 
I miss you <3 :( 
Watching < PROPFEMALE > McGuire !!! :) Thank you fellow < PROPFEMALE > McGuire fans and youtube/Disney for not caring about a show that's years old xD 
Ah what a first crush does ...... ( Part 2 of < PROPFEMALE > McGuire's First Kiss ) 
Sis , even though we are thousands of < PROPMALE > apart , you still make me smile and feel loved in my heart ? Missing you gets easier each day because I am one day closer to spending time with you when you return back home . :) 
When we honestly ask ourselves which person in our lives means the most to us , we often find that it is those who , instead of giving advice , solutions , or cures , have chosen rather to share our pain and touch our wounds with a warm and tender hand . - Henri Nouwen 
Going to get stressed out during April x-x Yey !!! Not really ..... cause May's only finals week for me ( 1st week of the month ) Still trying to think of work & volunteer schedule probably will work only late shifts so I'm able to spend time with friends <3 :) English 102 is an online course if I take it over the summer ; no break for me LOL !! at least I can be with people I love <3 ^_^ :D 
So if a tsunami hits , my condo just made it in clear of the evacuation zone in Waikiki but I'll probably have to be manpower at < PROPFEMALE>'s MC since they will need disaster volunteers to help hospital staff . Which I don't mind cause I love hospitals but going to like a crazy busy ER day in there @@ 
Can't go to classes no bus running .... 
Even though stayed up until 4am watching the tsunami come in and Chaminade , Heald & Hawaii Baptist Academy are the only schools open today on the entire island . Today is a good day cause all my classes were cancelled including lab & genetics barely had a full lecture , pre-cal exam moved to Monday . :) 
Japan all the devastation lives lost and the recovery effort ; all the troubles going around in the middle east . Reminds us how precious life is that it could be lost in a second without notice . So take time out of your day to remind all of those that you love that you love them ; you never know what can happen in this world . ^^ 
Glad that no < PROPMALE > damage happened on the West Coast countries that were issued Tsunami warnings and watches . But prays for Japan for their disaster relief , nuclear plant crisis - nothing bad happens , healing and that no more lives are lost during the after-shocks which can last the whole rest of the year . 
Daylight savings so all my friends on the West Coast ( Washington , Oregon and California ) 3 hours ahead of me :) So I hope you all get sleep before I sleep here in Hawaii or else it's like morning over there by then LOL no really ... sleep is good for you ^^

Watching Raise Your Voice :D yes it's 2am but it's spring break and I skip some parts anyways ..... I've seen it too much but haven't watched it for a while xD 
All my essays for religion and history over break .... and take home Genetics exam to do x-x I miss my friends <3 :( 
Dislikes the nightmares I've been having :( What scares me more than getting hurt , despair and pain is losing the people I love the most , both physically and emotionally because pain is only temporary . Losing the people I love that can never be replaced will make me lose part of my heart and world . Those have been my nightmares lately :/ 
Being the best volunteer I can be when I volunteer on Friday :) I love medicine <3 
My Cellphone isn't working again .... I can receive calls and texts but I am not able to respond because I cannot text nor call out . So I'll facebook message , write on your wall or find some other way of communication until my cell phone works again x-x 
I miss texting lol I guess I don't call much now since I live at home :D better than a huge phone < PROPMALE > for calling mainland ^^ 
Cell phone should work by 5-6pm Hawaii time so .... I should be able to text by 8-9pm California time 
Cell works again :D spring break over after this weekend :( at least summer break is soon . 1 month of lecture , finals in the 1st week of May then spend time with all the people I love <3 
So .... I haven't correctly learned parking yet , permit expires in August . If I don't pass , I'm going to need a permit for another year x-x I want to drive ( if gas wasn't so high lol ) . Summer Vacation I can't wait until I can spend time with people that I love . :)

Waiting for the < PROPFEMALE > skies to return so I can enjoy the beautiful sunsets everyday :D 
Why waste time & energy being angry and hating someone ? When you can spend that time loving them and making a better future :) The past doesn't define us , it's our choices . My past made me who I am today brought me new friends into my life and brought me closer to my best friends and my sister <3 I wouldn't have it any other way :) Live , Laugh and LOVE <3 ^_^ 
Even the sky is sad when all my best friends and sister are away !! It keeps raining every week or every other week lol . Maybe when you come home it'll be < PROPFEMALE > 
Procrastinating is more fun than homework .... is that summer mode talking ? Or just me wishing I could < PROPFEMALE > out with my Chaminade friends more and that my Hawaii friends in the mainland were home now :( 
Volunteer Luncheon at Hale Koa Hotel for < PROPFEMALE>'s Medical Center Volunteers Tomorrow :D free good food , door prizes , my pin for 100 hours in hospital volunteering and a gift for all those who attend :) probably a QMC mug or something . Then I gotta rush over to Genetics Lab xD LOL

I wish my friends on the mainland that live in Hawaii were home right now !!! I miss all so much :( I'm missing you more than caring about my finals !!! x-x I guess it's the \So close yet so far away\ " feeling once again ; 4-6 weeks away but seems so far in time :/ "

Abdominal pain hurts like it did when I went to ER on Feb 14 but not as Sharp ..... I hope no ER nor surgery >.< I'm worried :( 
Had a great time meeting Teejay's family at 50th anniversary :) abdominal pain still kind of there , if it gets to be a sharp unbearable pain again going to ER :( doctors here I come 
abdominal pain is becoming unbearable getting worse by the minute , I want to cry :( I don't want to take any more pain reliever medications 
At the Emergency Room at Struab Clinic and Hospital . Happy 2 months Teejay :) 
Doctors in ER found nothing again .... but small ovarian cystic . I have to follow up with OB/GYN and GI doctors now . Pain still there .... just hurts less :( 
My primary care doc thinks I just pulled my abdominal muscle & just need follow up + physical next week . I have 2 pea sized ovarian cysts , so might see OB/GYN later about it . Other then that pain meds for the small leftover pain unless it happens again >.< hopefully not see a GI doctor . 
Enough needles !! Well those big ones at least >.< Got another blood + urine test for my dermatologist to be put on a stronger medicine & still got flu + TB test to do so I can keep volunteering at QMC . Now both arms veins are going to be bruised :(

At Struab ER , I fainted at POB 1 pharmacy after fasting and blood test .... got another ambulance ride xD 
Fainted at Queens Medical Center POB 1 pharmacy after fasting and blood test but went to Struab ER got EKG , another blood and urine test and patient food . I had more than enough ER visits this year >.< 
Fainting - getting light headed , seeing bright lights like the sun in my face that I can't see then going black as my ears are ringing and can't hear . Is a sensation I never want to feel again . Thanks to the QMC POB 1 people to catch me or it would've been worse that I'd might've gotten a concussion too >.<

I've got 3 too many ER visits at Straub this year x_x I don't want anymore even if it's good patient experience !! :( sadly IVs and blood tests ( if the technique done right ) is starting to hurt less ...... so I can handle ER better @_@
