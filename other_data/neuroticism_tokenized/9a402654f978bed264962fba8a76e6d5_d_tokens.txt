Helping momma with the tree and trying to beg her to take me to the store !! 

So I'm going to be completely honest .... I'm afraid of what this New Year will bring me 
Found that My Spetum is Curved inword so far , That Is Blocking the airway on the Right Side . More Surgery To Come probably . 
Happy Valentines Day Everyone . :) 
For this Valentines Day , I bought a Scrapbook For < PROPFIRST > And I to Share . It Is to fill the Memories We've had or Will Have , With Are Greatest Friends , Family And Other events . And I would Like to Inform you That It would be a Honor to Have you in our Scrapbook . Pictures , letters or notes , little objects and what not would be great . If You have any ideas , please let < PROPFIRST > or me know . We Appreciate It Greatly . :) 
What do you do , When you want Guidance , but at the same time , you want to try it yourself ? 
Gettting My Hair cut and colored at 6 :) . Going to look totally different . 
Went to hospital with Chest Pain around 12am and didn't get back home till around 3 . So I'm going to the family doc . to get more info on whats going on in my chest . 
I feel attacked by < PROPFEMALE > many people in my school . I guess they have nothing better to do but to talk crap about me . 
If everyone’s eyes saw the same , Lives would be shame . Looks never change , And days are strange . Being different is how I’m known , True feelings shown . But no one sees , How it hurts me . Looking out , I see no ones help , My heart will melt . I won’t follow . Earth is hollow . 
Prom tonight . EXcited :D 
Getting My hair cut again back to the fohawk ^_^

Breathe , breathe in the air\ 
Don't be afraid to care\ 
Leave but don't leave me\ 
Look around and chose your own ground\

And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry\ 
And all you touch and all you see\ 
Is all your life will ever be\

Who do you think you are , running around leaving scars , collecting your jar of hearts , and tearing love apart . 
My favorite song right now is the Tiger song from The Hangover :P 
When you hurt me , I'm left with scars . When I cry , the scars begin to enlarge . And when I finally realize nothing will change , I will always be scarred .
