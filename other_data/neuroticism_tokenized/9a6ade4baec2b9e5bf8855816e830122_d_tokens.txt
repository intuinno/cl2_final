About two and a half houra to KC 
I am unpacked and returned the truck . When I returned the truck thry said I had 4 days , i thought i only had two .. 
We are given two hands to hold , two feet to walk , and two eyes to see , but we are only given one heart because the other was given to someone for us to find . 
look to the future , don't get stuck in the past or you might be left standing alone . 
Man : Can I buy you a drink ?? \ 
Lady : No thank-you ... it's not good for my legs . \ 
Man : Why ... do they swell ?? \ 
Lady : No ... they spread . 
The power went out about 6 and is still out 
when two people are having a converstation and when it ends isn't it polite to saay goodbye or later or anything like that ?
