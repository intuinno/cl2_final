“I have been through a lot and have suffered a great deal . But I have had lots of happy moments , as well . Every moment one lives is different from the other . The good , the bad , hardship , the joy , the tragedy , love , and happiness are all interwoven into one single , indescribable whole that is called life . You cannot separate the good from the bad . And perhaps there is no need to do so , either . ” - < PROPFIRST > O ' (:
