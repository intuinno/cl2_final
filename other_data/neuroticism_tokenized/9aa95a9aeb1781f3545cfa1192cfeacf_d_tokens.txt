Depression is not a sign of weakness , it is a sign that you have been trying to be strong for too long . Put this as your status if you know someone who has or has had depression . Most people won't , but its Mental Health Week and 1 in 3 of us will suffer at some point in our lives . Show your support good people ?

Ahhh life ... 
People think that a liar gains a victory over his victim . What I've learned is that a lie is an act of self-abdication , because one surrenders one's reality to the person to whom one lies , making that person one's master , condemning oneself from then on to faking the sort of reality that persons view requires to be faked . 
A man is never drunk if he can lay on the floor without holding on . \

“We are well advised to keep on nodding terms with the people we used to be , whether we find them attractive company or not . Otherwise they turn up unannounced and surprise us , come hammering on the mind's door at 4am of a bad night and demand to know who deserted them , who betrayed them , who is going to make amends . We forget all too soon the things we thought we could never forget . ” - < PROPFIRST > Didion
