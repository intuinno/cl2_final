What fanfuckingtastic New Year's! 

Singing and acting and dancing is my life .... 
my feet hurt a lot but my back feels like it just spent 23 minutes in hell . I just took a Viclupin for the pain . 
GOOD NIGHT ! 
I don't want a novel ! Just a paragraph . 
PCATs saturday :[ :[ 
Gutentaug . 
COLLEGE TOMORROW ! 
keep bleeding , keep keep bleeding in love . < PROPMALE > STOLE my orgo book . I don't know whom I can trust any more ... 
Good ! Our class was all wrong because honestly we weren't that smart as a whole . I am taking microcell biology , organic chemistry ( chem 2443 ) and anatomy and physiology . I will definitely let you know if I need help in orgo !! 
i hate this new facebook . 
I walked in the cold night air in shorts and sandals as my destination , my warmth , grew tantalizingly close . When McMahon was only a few yards away , my cold feet stopped . The emergency lights pulsated ; bedroom lights , like a game of Connect 4 , turne ... d the building into a piece of yellow graph paper ; and the splotch that was the fire glowed mendaciously , as if only to silhouette those who had to jump from it . 
mmmm burnt toast , odwalla , and mcb ....
