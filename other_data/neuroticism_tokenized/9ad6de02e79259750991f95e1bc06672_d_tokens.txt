OK , officially been awake for 25hrs . now . I've finished a 500+ pg . book I started yesterday , shot 2 armadillos , washed 3 loads of clothes , played countless games of solitare . It has got to be the PREDNISONE , I've taken 34 since Tues . at lunch time exactly as prescribed , I have 3 more to go , don't know if I'll ever sleep again . No pain though or pain pills since Wed . 
Oh what a difference a good nights sleep can make & the neighbors slept too , no armadillo hunting last night ! 
May have overdone it a little yesterday , pretty dang sore today . Done with the prednisone now if I can get over this metallic taste in my mouth , don't think I've eaten any tin cans ! 
Not feeling to good right now ...... headache for 3 days , thinking it must be after effects of anesthesia ?? 
Off to the Dr. this morning , its been 16 days since surgery , praying for a good report . Soooo ready to resume my normal activities , this sitting around is driving me crazy or should I say crazier !! 
One of my incisions is not healing as it should so prescription for a Z-pack & back to the Dr. in a week . Hope this antibiotic works its magic . 
Back to the Dr. this past Tues ., allergic to the internal stitches , got 2 of em out , sure hope thats all . 
Good day on the sandbar yesterday . Forgot to turn off the alarm last night though , sure woulda liked to of slept in this morning !

Home from the mountains , we had a great time . Busy week ahead . LOVIN this weather !! 
I like it on the floor by my dresser ! 
This week we remember all babies born sleeping or whom we carried but never met , or those we have held but could not take home or the ones that came home but did not stay . Make this your profile status if you or someone you know has suffered the loss of a baby . The majority won't do it because unlike cancer baby loss is still taboo . Break the silence . In memory of all the Angels . 
We had a great weekend , Sunday school party on Sat . nite , great food & friends . Went for a ride on the bikes after church , the weather was perfect 
Camping @ Ft . McAllister this weekend with a candlelight tour of the fort Sat . night , should be great !
