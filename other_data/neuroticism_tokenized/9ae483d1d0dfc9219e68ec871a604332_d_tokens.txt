o “It cannot be too often repeated that all dogmas are different , and that morality is the same among all men who use their reason . Therefore morality comes from God like light . Our superstitions are nothing but darkness ”§ Voltaire , Dictionnaire Philosophique ( 1764 )

Read the following in number order - it is too long for one post . 
#1 . What games that man play , in no other species do you see one group consciously planning to KILL another group of its own kind . You see the survival of the fittest animal against animal but after the fight there is reason for the killing and that leaves no thing behind . Usually animals kill other animals for food and that at least makes sense . 
#2 . Men you see kill the other men and look away immediately not even giving that person and whatever sort of family they had a single thought . Man ruins lives and tears up the most precious fabric of life that God gave us . Hopelessness , despair , heartache , feelings – animals do not have these things and yet they are more civilized than men . War is just a game played by men who have no better thing to do . 
#3 . Do they even care that in their game of “chess” the pieces are conscious living beings with lives and families just as the others do . What hypocrites you find in the human race they fight the war they say for peace but war itself is the absence of peace , the absence of humanity , the absence of feelings in any sort of fashion . 
#4 . Why do men kill one another for a piece of ground or something else that they want ? But man is never satisfied . War is all they want and they drag apart the world they have in vain because more is all they want and more is what they never will get . 
I need help - i cant figure out how to change my profile picture to my zwinky character . Can someone explain it to me plz ?

OK , I hate my home internet provider it goes so very slow . That's about the only thing i miss about college ~ the working internet was much better there 
Well , after all of its hard work and helping , my Laptop finally died . :'( Now i have very limited access to the internet and may take awhile to respond to anything sent to me . So plz be patient untill i get a new laptop . 
Since my laptop is dead and my internet server is messed up , I can no longer do much on the internet . I cant even play the games i like very much but i can still play some . As for Happy pets i still need everything but horse shoes for my barn and would appreciate it if someone can send me some . 
Finally , after the horrible death of my laptop almost a month ago , I have ordered a new one which will hopefully arrive soon . Things are looking up .

Got back from Target and read my homework for ENG 2100 \The Death of < PROPMALE > Ilych\ " by Tolstoy . It doesn't seems to go along with this class's theme . I dont see how Existentialism fits in . Hopefully i will understand it better once we have our Socratic Circle discussion tomorrow . "

I wish people would stop cussing around me . I know I use to say that I didn't care as long as they weren't cussing at me but I've changed my mind . It's a bad influence on me and I want it to stop . Please , those of you who read this and know me , please try to treat me with the same respect that you would give to < PROPFEMALE > and don't cuss around me . It's very depressing .
