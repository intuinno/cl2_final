Difficulty sleeping ... Worried and thinking too much . Good night . 

Math is evil , kinda like money/politicians being evil but in a less obvious way . 
< PROPFIRST > we need new pics on here . i think my main one is almost a year old 
I'd like to thank the people/advertisers that make hulu possible and remind me that i need to donate even more money to Haiti every commercial . It has to cost a lot to advertise that much yet they want me to believe it makes it to haiti ??? 
TOO Much Math Homework ! I have an exam this friday too ... Evil 
is querulous because UPS is taking there sweet time , but this is just a vehmented rant because i am overly eager to get my stuff . It can take until 7pm ... I might die from high blood pressure before then . 
IT'S MY B-DAY !!! And all I want to do is curl up and sleep on this dreadful ' reminding me I am getting older and there is nothing I can do to stop it ' day 
Is getting depressed . But there is too much Homework to get done , why math has to have an exam almost every two weeks EVIL !! 
Going to get some Coffee !!! 
It was a good morning , then I woke up . 
Evil busy stuff ... cant wait till summer , then I'll be bored and wanting school to start .
