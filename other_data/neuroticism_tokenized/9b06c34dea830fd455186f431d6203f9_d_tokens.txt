I am trying to gradually understand girls , but i suppose it will take forever , but for now , my first theory on the relatively see-through ploys of girls : 
This one is the classic girl theory , but i shall rename it as mine anyway . 
Why is it always that when i'm optimistic or confident about something it turns out much worse than i expect ? That is why i'm usually optimistically pessimistic ... 
10 people are born gay . Meaning 1 of every 10 people is instantly put down , given bad labels , left alone , put in minority , and so much more , just because of who they are . Many gay teens are turning to suicide as a way of escaping . If you want to tell them to hold their heads high and ...... that you respect them ... for who they are , copy and paste this . Most of you won't , but lets see the 5% of you who will . 
Dear Royston , you have a cute animal cloud . If we were in a room together , I would draw so many animal clouds in ur room . Me and you should draw one huge animal cloud . Ifyou hugged me , I would poke u in the sides . You are weird . I'd get your name tattooed on my shoulder . You have just been dared to make this ... your status 
Religion or Science ? Which do you think is more important ? 
I need three words to describe me for my ens bio-board thingy people plz help :)
