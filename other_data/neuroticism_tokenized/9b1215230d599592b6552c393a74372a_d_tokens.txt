:'( I had the best idea to film , but the stupid daylight is gone . 
I saw < PROPFEMALE > . 
A great love , is a lot like a good memory . When it's there- and you know it's there , but it's just out of your reach , it can be all that you think about . So then you can focus on it and try to force it , but the more you do , the more you seem to push it away . But if you're patient and you hold still- maybe , just maybe ... It will come to you . 
So , pretty much I found a loophole in Back to the Future 2 . The future Biff goes back to 1955 to give the young Biff the sports almanac . However when the old Biff returns to 1985 it was the un-altered version of 1985 . Technically he should of arrived in the alternate universe 1985 .... Loop holes ftw
