My audition could have gone a lot better :( 
I think it's funny when people put \i aint gonna lie\ " or \ " i'll rate u honestly\ " as their status but tell COMPLETE lies to the people who liked their status . That's why you'll NEVER see my status as that because I would actually be honest and a lot of people really don't want to hear my honest opinion ... " 
The things I find easy , others find hard ; The things I find funny , others find stupid ; The things I find taboo , other find acceptable .... Oh how I love being different :D

Greatest man in history named Jesus , had no servants , yet they called him Master . Had no degree , yet they called him Teacher . Had no medicines , yet they called him Healer . Had no army , yet kings feared him . He won no military battles , yet He conquered the world . He committed no crime , yet they crucified Him . He was buried in a tomb , yet He lives today . Re-post if you believe Jesus is the reason for the season 
This break has given me A LOT of time to do some serious studying :) 
The more I try to avoid/ignore a person , the more I see them . 
People can sound really humble/deep on FB , but in real life they're complete opposites . 
My teacher tells us not to go to Sparknotes.com and use their information because they're not a reputable site but come to find out everything that she says is from there ! 
FINALLY I'M HOME !!!! 
My Spring Break has been going very peacefully :)
