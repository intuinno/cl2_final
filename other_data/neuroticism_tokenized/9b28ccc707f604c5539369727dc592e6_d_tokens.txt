\Its a damn cold night trying to figure out this life wont you take me by the hand take me somewhere new i dont know who you are but i ... im with you \""

\i'd lie for you and thats the truth \"" 
YES ! Concert Band begins tomorrow ! I cant wait ! All State here i come ! 
To Isengard ! Though Isengard be ringed and barred with doors of stone ; Through Isengard be strong and hard , as cold as stone and bare as bone , We go , we go , we go to war , to hew the stone and break the door ; For bole and bough are are burning now , the furnace roars-we go to war ! To land of glood with tramp of doom , with roll of drum , we come , we come ; To isengard with doom we come ! with doom we come , with doom we come ! 
Ere iron was found or tree was hewn , When young was mountian under < PROPFEMALE > ; Ere ring was made , or wrought was woe , It walked the forests long ago . 
All State auditions are killing me ...... makes me angry 
Anger ..... Is it a good thing or a bad thing ? Generally speaking 
AHHHH !!! why do i have to play piccolo ?? :( -sigh- 
is suffering from a severe pain in his right ear . Conclution : the piccolo is bad for your ear's health . Result : need earplugs to practice piccolo . 
Closed off from love I didn't need the pain Once or twice was enough And it was all in vain Time starts to pass Before you know it you're frozen But something happened For the very first time with you My heart melts into the ground Found something true And everyone's looking round Thinking I'm going crazy 
It's not a silly little moment , It's not the storm before the calm . This is the deep and dying breath of This love that we've been working on . Can't seem to hold you like I want to So I can feel you in my arms . Nobody's gonna come and save you , We pulled too many false alarms . We're going down , And you can see it too . We're going down , And you know that we're doomed . My dear , We're slow dancing in a burning room . 
Would you know my name If I saw you in heaven Will it be the same If I saw you in heaven I must be strong , and < PROPFEMALE > on Cause I know I don't belong Here in heaven 
If i could reach the stars , Id pull one down for you . Shine it on my heart so you could see the truth . That this love i have inside , is everthing it seems . But for now i find , Its only in my Dreams , That i can Change the World . I would be the sunlight in your universe You would think my love was really something good . Baby , if i could change the world . 
Don't tell me it's not worth tryin ' for You can't tell me it's not worth dyin ' for You know it's true Everything I do - I do it for you 
To really love a woman to understand her you've got to know what deep inside hear every thought see every dream and give her wings when she wants to fly and when you find yourself lying helpless in her arms You know you really love a woman 
< PROPFEMALE > bottom blues , you made me cry . I don ? t want to lose this feeling . And if I could choose a place to die It would be in your arms . Do you want to see me crawl across the floor to you ? Do you want to hear me beg you to take me back ? I'd gladly do it because I don't want to fade away . Give me one more day , please . I don ? t want to fade away . In your heart I want to stay . 
has the Top Gun Anthem stuck in his head and listening to it didnt get rid of it ... so he is watching the movie now 
J'arrêterai seu < PROPFEMALE > ment de faire l'amour à votre corps quand < PROPMALE > étoi < PROPMALE > tombent du ciel et < PROPMALE > accidents de lune dans < PROPFEMALE > so < PROPFEMALE > il . 
FACEBOOK TRICK : press up , up , down , down , left , right , left , right , B , A , Enter key , then right click then press up and down and magic circles will appear . the only way to get rid of them is to log off or refresh the page ... IT WILL WORK ! put this as your status if it works . 
I love rock n roll . Put another dime in the jukebox baby . I love rock n roll . Come and take the time and dance with me . 
In some cases words fail me : its times like this that music was made for .

\THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA IS HERE \"" 
Settled in Silence ............. Amazing band :D 
The End of All Things 
guitar recitial tomorrow , band practice sunday , and band concert monday . i cant wait !!! Music , here i come !!! 
Beethoven's 5th keeps playing in my head without a pause . Ever . 
hates the prospect of having to go to school tomorrow . yet has to because of the band concert and a docters appointment . oh the joy ........ 
Music Has Taken Over What Little Mind I Had . 
bored .... first thing that comes to mind .... LISTEN TO BEETHOVEN'S 5TH !!!! I am truely hooked .... 
Sadness ... for no reason .... What light through yonder window breaks ? It is the East , and Julliet is the sun . Arise fair sun and kill the envious < PROPFEMALE > , which is already sick and pale with grief ...... Dont ask where that came from because i dont know 
first time i've practiced all state music today Whahoo ! actually it doesnt seem too difficult which probably means that im missing a lot of simple things that i could do better :P 
Say Hello to a world of Music . Where you walk on notes that cresendo and decresendo and you swim in waves of sound that make you wish you could drown and still live just to drown again and all the while there isnt a moment that is meaningless . 
Feel The Sting Of Memories Long Gone Return To Torment You 
I Had A Great Idea For My Song ! then i forgot it .... Then I Remembered It !!! .... i remembered that it was not mine ... it was Spring from The Four Seasons by Vivaldi ..... no wonder it sounded so good .... 
DAMN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
All Alone 
The End Is Near 
Soft music ... a flowing saxophone solo with a gentle piano for colour .... the only light is a few scattered candles that create a warm haze in the room ... you are there ... just like my dreams told me you would ... i reach out to pull you close to me ... and just as my eyes close for the perfect kiss ... I Wake Up . I suddenly feel cold , and i pull my blankets closer around me ... but it doesnt help ... because youre not there . 
Do you know what makes a piccolo sound better ? Earplugs ! 
YAY FOR BEETHOVEN\S 9TH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! " 
: THE LONER 
being a romantic is not good for your sanity 
dont understand what i am feeling ..... 
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH !!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
waste of time 
. Have a lot of things to do ... i dont feel well ... i kinda just want to cuddle up with some girl with nice smelling hair and forget the rest of the world 
Love Is A Many Splended thing . Love Lifts Us up Where We Belong . Or it lets us fall into the depths of Loneliness . 
All You Need Is Love- To make you happy for Life or to destroy it and make it into ruins of shattered wishes . 
The Greatest Thing , You Will Ever Learn , Is Just To Love , And Be Loved In Return . The Second greatest thing is to Love and not be Loved in return ( it is also one of the harshest lessons of Life ) . Such Is The Power Of Love . 
Yes ... i felt her tears flow on my forehead ... on mine , mine !... they were soft ... they were sweet !... they trickled under my mask ... they mingled with my tears in my eyes ... they flowed between my lips ... i tore off my mask so as not to lose one of her tears ... and she did not run away !... And she did not die !... She remained alive , weeping over me , with me . We cried together ! i have tasted all the happiness the world can offer ! 
La plus grande chose est juste d'aimer et être aimée en échange > 
All By Myself , Dont want to be All By Myself , Anymore ... 
Loneliness and Music . Any Ideas ? any ( except stupid ones :D ) 
Suffer In Silence 
Todays been awful .... my mom is sick . im sick . And worst of all my cat had another seizure :'( 
Whats the most beautiful thing in the world ? 
SPRING BREAK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
ob la de ob la da life goes on .... Boredom ... 
Permettez-moi d'embrasser votre corps < PROPFEMALE > de la tête à l'orteil . ;) 
SILLY GIRLS :D 
i didnt get to see you , but just the thought of the < PROPMALE > was enough to cure my depression :) 
i would like to hear EVERYONES opinion on this . If you could change one thing in the world , what would it be ? 
another question for everyone . whats your fantasy ? your number one fantasy ? 
Call it a feeling ... a feeling that i cant stop and i cant explain . It just is and i am at its mercy . 
Ha . Time can not kill Life for Life must live forever . If it didnt we would all be dead the moment Life died . Life Never Dies . 
Thats the shortened way to put it . The only simple way to say it . Thats why the poets and the writters came up with the word love because it was to complex to fit in a story or a poem otherwise . 
Concert tonight :) and tomorrow :) and my solo and a quintet the day after that :) 
sooo ... my phone has been dead for the past three days because i couldnt find my charger for it . i finally gave up looking for it and bought a new one . -phone charged- -press end- -Verizon- -1 new txt message- after 3 days ? isnt my social life out of control ? :P

I begin eternity , \ 
And end space , \ 
At the end of time , \ 
And in every place , \ 
Last in life , \ 
Second to death , \ 
Never alone , \ 
Found in your breath , \ 
Contained by earth , \ 
Water or flame , \ 
My grandeur so awesome , \ 
Wind dare not tame , \ 
Not in your mind , \ 
Am in your dreams , \ 
Vacant to Kings , \ 
Present to Queens 
I have many tongues but cannot taste\ 
By me , most things are turned to waste\ 
I crack and snap , yet I stay whole\ 
I may take the largest toll\ 
I assisted all of the first men\ 
And I will pay them back again\ 
Around me , people snuggle and sleep\ 
Yet run when I am released from my keep\ 
I jump around and leap and bound\ 
The cold man wishes I he had found 
GRRRRAAAAAAHHHHHH ! 
Suffer . In . Silence . 
here and now is normally when i makes some deep , thought out , philosophical statement , seeing as it is 3 in the am ... but not today ! F U HW ! 
stumbleupon.com, i <3 you =) 
okay ... people ... people . i dont give a damn if you think < PROPFIRST > beiber is gay , awful , and everything else you abhor . but i do care that i see his name everywhere . i dont want to see his name when im looking up slayer , iron maiden , and pantera ! all you are doing is giving him free publicity . what you should be doing is ignore him so that his name fades away into the dust .
