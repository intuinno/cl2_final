Went on a picnic with a bunch of recovering attics and drunks and had myself a blast . Just wish my man could of come home with us . But he is right where he needs to be and by the grace of god he will be stong in his recovery cause we all love the sober him . He won't be home for another 49 days . Its funny how I bitched about him ta < PROPMALE > up the entire < PROPMALE > size bed yet now that I have it all to myself I can't sleep . 

Its good to remember the positive , so remember not to dwell in the negative .
