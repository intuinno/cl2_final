And oh when I'm old and wise Bitter words mean little to me Autumn Winds will blow right through me And someday in the mist of time When they asked me if I knew you I'd smile and say you were a friend of mine And the sadness would be Lifted from my eyes Oh when I'm old and wise 
At this time my thoughts and prayers go out to my brothers and sisters who lost their lives today at Fort Hood . Also my heart and prayers are with the friends and families and those wounded on this sad day .

My son thinks that he should be allowed to do his work around the house when he feels like it , which is never . 
If you & I woke up in jail together ... using only FOUR words ... what would you say to me ? Copy and paste this in your status and see what funny things your friends say .... ( And if you make a comment , you gotta put this in your status . Fair is fair . )

“It seemed like this was one big Prozac nation , one big mess of malaise . Perhaps the next time half a million people gather for a protest march on the White House green it will not be for abortion rights or gay liberation , but because we’re all so bummed out . ” - < PROPFEMALE > Wurtzel 
“Be what you would seem to be - or , if you'd like it put more simply - never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise . ” 
woke this morning with a splitting headache .

This planet has — or rather had — a problem , which was this : most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much all of the time . Many solutions were suggested for this problem , but most of these were largely concerned with the movement of small green pieces of paper , which was odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy .

Tired , very tired . 
Renfest was awesome 
There is no love untouched by hate\ 
\ 
no unity without discord\ 
there is no courage without fear\ 
there is no peace without a war\ 
there is no wisdom without regret\ 
no admiration without scorn\ 
there is strife within the tempest-\ 
but calm in the eye of the storm ... 
< PROPFEMALE > has to go into surgery to remove dead skin and they are going to put on synthetic skin . 
They say it's impossible to survive without daily human contact , but then the Glowing Orb Beings from Muugaave-6 have ways of keeping you alive . 
You never thought you'd end up a billionaire , living in a palatial mansion , and jet-setting around the world . So it's no real disappointment , when you don't 
You'll continue to sweat the small stuff , thanks to a set of abnormally large exocrine glands . 
While it's true that love has no boundaries , no limits , and no rules , your court-appointed restraining order has all three . 
60% of the country is in favor of the immigration law that Arizona has . For some reason certain states are boycotting Arizona . The Education Department has now canceled a convention set for October at a Tucson resort after the Mexican government said it would not send any representatives to the meeting . Funny how the Mexican government has more political sway over our federal government than one of our states . 
A cleansing fire will sweep across the land , purifying countless souls , purging all guilt and sin , and defrosting a number of delicious Hungry-Man dinners . 
the coke machine at Dinos just spewed all over < PROPFIRST > . TOO FUNNY 
If you can't smile and laugh at work occasionally , then you're clearly doing something wrong , Mr. Surgical Oncologist . 
I'm getting sick .

Happy turkey day everyone 
What a stressful day between issues with my daughter and finding out that my mother has some serious medical issues . Sometimes it is hard to remain positive . 
I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve .
