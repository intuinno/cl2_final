Today has been one hell of a day ... 
Nine times out of ten it is over the Bridge of Sighs that we pass the narrow gulf from youth to manhood . That interval is usually marked by an ill placed or disappointed affection . We recover and we find ourselves a new being . The intellect has become hardened by the fire through which it has passed . The mind profits by the wrecks of every passion , and we may measure our road to wisdom by the sorrows we have undergone . 
Wow ... just realized how much $ I have .. :( 
Super stoked for movies tonight with my lovely < PROPFEMALE > Dzafic 
Sometimes I wish life had a remote that you could press re-wind on 
Applying for my passport today !! Did you know there is a processing fee & an accecptance fee lol awesome but I am super stoked !! <3
