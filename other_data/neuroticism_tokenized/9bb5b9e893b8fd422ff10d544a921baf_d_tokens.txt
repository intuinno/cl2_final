... is having a lovely evening out in the yard with the dogglies !!! The weather is perfect and I'm lovin ' it !!! 
... is freakin ' out just a little cuz she's gettin ' fat & soft from having NO time to work out lately !!! LOL !!! Tragic !!!

OK people !!! Another reminder that we as drivers are simply not mindful enough of what and who is near and around us on the road -- especially motorcyclists !!! Someone who wasn't payin ' close enough attention has nearly killed my big brother while he was out for a ride on his motorcycle !!! LOOK AROUND YOU !!! BE AWARE !!! CHECK AND DOUBLE CHECK AND TRIPLE CHECK !!! PLEASE !!! 
Update on my big bro ' !!! During neuro testing this morn he was able to understand and respond correctly to commands from the docs !!! YAY !!! Super-happy news !!! 
... says thanks ever so much to all of you who are well-wishing and sending positive thoughts/energy to my brother and his family , and including me in those thoughts ... you are all so very appreciated !!! 
... has gotten super-happy news tonight ! My brother is awake , PT has gotten him on his feet , speech therapy will see him tomorrow , and he told his wife to ' Get me out of here ' ... I am deliriously happy over this news !!! 
... has had a bit of bad news -- a setback in my big bro's progress -- please keep all the positive energy goin ' to him and his family !!! 
Had a better report on her big bro today , and is now at the Joint drinkin ' a beer and waitin ' to see Bad Company !!! 
... says that if she died tonight she would die a happy woman for having finally seen Bad Company !!! * sigh * 
... update on big bro-he passed the swallow test-now allowed ice chips-PT had him up-assisted he took a side step-he's being evaluated for rehab-soon Rene'e will be able to take him outside(once he gets off so many monitors)-still in ICU-hopin ' he'll improve enough soon so he can go to a room where his family can stay w/him-please keep positive energy going to them-Rene'e is strong but send some extra energy her way- 
... < PROPFIRST > might get out of ICU tomorrow !!! Startin ' to feel like I can believe he's actually gonna make it ... I was utterly terrified that he wouldn't ... 
... is bummed cuz < PROPFIRST > didn't get out of ICU after all-he still has a fever/infection of uncertain origin -- pulled out his feeding tube again -- but on a good note was singing along with his son who was sitting with him and playing guitar -- at least , that's the report I got today -- 
... has heard that while < PROPFIRST > is still in ICU , his WBCs are back to normal , so hopefully that means antibiotics are gettin ' rid of whatever the infection was that had a hold on him -- on a sad note , I was told that when he was shown pics of his siblings , he didn't recognize us ... :-( 
... is not happy with the report she got today about her big bro'--nope , not happy at all ... 
... is super-happy to report that < PROPFIRST > was kicked from ICU up to rehab today !!! Now begins the grueling process of relearning how to walk , talk , etc .!!! I am so much more hopeful today !!! Thanks for all the positive energy/thoughts , and keep them going to him & Rene'e!!! 
Good report on < PROPFIRST > today -- he is regaining the use of his left side , and is being ambulated up & down the hallways-with assistance , of course , but it's good progress -- :-)
