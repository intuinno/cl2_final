I am really craving the pineapple 

2009 . An odd year . Full of many new experiences . I hope to < PROPFEMALE > the speed through to the next year , never backing off , searching for that limit on life's edge , without the full throttle drama I tend to get . 2009 was a great year . Now 2010 will be the best . As I type this I hear the new year thundering in . No wait , that's < PROPFIRST>'s fireworks ... 
We would like to ask that when people pour out their soul into their statuses , frequently and so intensely , that you hid it in obscure references , seemingly irrelevant lyrics from a relevant song , metaphors that only the person you are trying to reach gets , or otherwise encrypting your messages for your rep and sanity of others . thank you to all to whom this may apply . 
any one know where I can by a whole pineapple for really cheap ? 
that's why they call them \fish \"!" 
I can't say I have it all figured out but i'm close 
absolutely nothing is on my mind .......................... 
has a winodow missing in his car and it's supposed to rain tomorrow ! 
Fastest window repair EVER ! 
Ha ! The GhettoWindo held !

Today I had [] Tea [] CherryYogurt [] CranberryJuice [] AllFormerlyMentioned ! I also had chicken . A good day , a good day . ( 5 ) 
Sigh ....

I should write a song about caffeine ! :) 
I'll think about it 
I have made a decision . I forgot what I was deciding on . 
All is not well ... 
Have you ever got a horrible feeling SO strong that something bad was going to happen that when it comes , you arent even affected by it ? 
In the past weeks I have decided that all this seriousness and drama is a waste of time for the young . We are meant for fun pursuits in the belief that if there is a one they will come at God's will , so we should keep our search wide and carefree as is ever possible and not look too close . 
? Somebody's gonna hurt somebody before the night through ? ? Somebody's gonna come undone , there's nothin ' we can do ! ? ? Everybody wants to touch some one , if it takes all night . ? ? Everybody wants to take a little < PROPMALE > , make it come out right ... 
and on that Bombshell , Its time to end ! 
? it's just a broken lullaby ... ? 
If we couldn't laugh we would all go insane . 
Hot tea is good for the soul . Oh how I missed you hot tea ! <3 
Coffeeeeeee ! '''''' \\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"''!" 
? The things you think are useless I can't understand ?

He expected a lambo and got a mustamg . She expected an S- cass and got a TVR . damn 
? ... that you meet , / is in for a real sur-prise ? 
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha ! Good job < PROPMALE > ! 
Please stay out of business . all is good and I'd like to keep my peace of mind . Thankyou . 
? Takin ' my time , ? Usin ' my line , ? Tryin ' to decide what to do . ? Looks my my stop , ? Don't wanna get off , ? Got myself < PROPMALE > up on you . ?? Seems to me , ?? You don't want to talk about it . ?? Seems to me , ?? You just turn your pretty head and ? Walk Away ? 
? yYeEOOOOOOOOOOOWWWwAAAAAAhWWwh ? 
I shall continue to do nothing . Nothing is best . This is not giving up . Contrarily , this is what i call a win . I am happiest when I do nothing and I will continue to do nothing , that is , until someone else gives me a reason to do something . But 3 strikes your out so ... nothing it is ! 
Awkwardness is a human creation . people make things awkward . We make our own awkwardness .. It's stemmed from a combination of cowardice and laziness . It reflects one's self confidence when one feels awkward everytime a situation arrives . Its hilarious though 
Haha 
How do people STAND that kid ! Ooh I to much sugar in CC ... 
Notice to all in Cross Country : fishin in River Legacy at 10:30 , hot tub at about twelve . Cafinated Beverages and aspargus recomended .

WTF < PROPMALE > !? 
Is talkin like a damn fool . Too much time on my hands . And really ticks a way at my sanity 
Who cares what people think ? Lol . 
I admit I blow things up for my own enjoyment . Its kinda a bad habit really 
Hahahaha DUH ! 
Everybody blows up things with little meaning into something huge . Then everybody is freaking out over nothing . And when you sit back you can see that a little curious chat and a little concern about feelings ultimately turns into a soap opera . Nobody likes soap operas . That's why theyre daytime tv . Go with the flow . It's nothing . honestly . 
My mom registered me for the SAT the day Of the REMARKABLE run . I never get to go 
Taco < PROPFEMALE > . Best lunch ever !
