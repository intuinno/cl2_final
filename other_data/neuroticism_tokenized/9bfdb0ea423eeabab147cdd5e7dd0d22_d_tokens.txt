Always be respectful to everyone . You never know when you will work for them or when they will serve you food . 
Before you throw a punch , ask yourself why you are really doing it . If it is because the other guy is angering you , step away . If it is in self defense or in the defense of others , ask yourself where the best place to punch the guy would be . Aside from that , do not throw a punch , unless it is for a sport . You will always regret it later .
