Happy new year . Ive actually acomplished every true goal I set for the last two years . They were moving forward with my life goals . This year : self improvemet . 

\Anybody can do just about anything with himself that he really wants to and makes his mind to do . We are capable of greater than we realize . \ " \ 
love is the answer at least to most of the questions of my heart like why are we here , where do we go , and how come it's so hard ... it's always better when we're together , yeah it's always better when we're together ... 
I might dream in technicolor , but i live in HD . :] 
haha :] 
family reunion tomorrow ... it's been a few years . 
thinks that todays gonna be great ! tomorrow looks good too . :] 
Have you ever wanted to be that one person that sticks out on a dull day when everything else just seems to melt together ; when everything seems to be shades of grey . The one thing that makes an impact , a memory- no matter how brief or fleeting the second is , it lives for ever in someone's mind . 
5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... and continue to wait . lol the car business is very slow in october i guess . 
life moves very fast . It seems even if your life is steady there's so much going on around you . There's never an excuse to not make your life the best possible , just step out of the comfort zone and brace yourself to get swept away . :] maybe that's a good thing 
hahahaha i can now tell which of you are as bored as i am right now ;] \ 
i like it ! hahaha 
come buy a car from me !! 
likes having a great night and feeling awesome the next day too . :] life is good . 
\let's close our eyes and hold on to this moment for the rest of our lives . \"" 
made breakfast ... it's not even 8 o'clock , pretty sure I should go back to sleep now . haha 
my kitten was almost kidnapped because he's so cute . He needs to learn to stay in the yard ... yeah right >.< 
would you do anything different then what you're doing right now if you were going to die in 2 years ? then i guess the question is- is that what you should be doing ? 
:] 
darling : favorite ; cherished . 
2.5 hours left and counting 
tonight = pizza :] 
good day . 
is having a good day . * 
starbucks at 4:20 ftw 
whiter shade of pale . idk what this song means .... but it's great . :] 
proof of todays greatness : the dj just said how great whiter shade of pale was ... but he had no idea what it meant . :] I find this funny 
Breathe deep the gathering gloom , Watch lights fade from every room . Bedsitter people look back and lament , Another day's useless energy spent . Impassioned lovers wrestle as one , Lonely man cries for love and has none . New mother picks up and suckles her son , Senior citizens wish they were young . Cold hearted orb that rules the night , Removes the colours from our sight . Red is grey and yellow white . 
But we decide which is right . And which is an illusion ? 
it's 8 o'clock on a friday evening and I'm sitting on the bed online . I think something is seriously wrong with me . today went from awesome to I'm really lame . 
gah ... gonna go to wh . bye 
skateboarding comp on tv ... dew tour ... it's actually pretty cool . 
people be crazy . 
:] gonna smile today , cause it's pretty outside 
true or false :\ 
Feminism is designed to make women feel unworthy for devoting their lives to the people they love . It forces them out of the house where their employers can control them . It forces infants into joyless daycares subject to conditioning and who-knows-what-else . 
time for a style update ... soon . don't want to jump into anything too quickly . lol i'm getting my ideas together , will set out to accomplish in the some what near future . 
:/ 
\You can't have a better tomorrow if you are thinking about yesterday all the time . \"- < PROPFIRST > F . KETTERING " 
i'm having an office party tomorrow ! ;] all day ! tomorrow will be great 
Love's not Time's fool , though < PROPFEMALE > lips and cheeks\ 
Within his bending sickle's compass come ;\ 
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks , \ 
But bears it out even to the edge of doom . \ 
If this be error and upon me proved , \ 
I never writ , nor no man ever loved . 
Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments ; love is not loveWhich alters when it alteration finds , Or bends with the remover to remove :O , no , it is an ever-fixèd mark , That looks on tempests and is never shaken ; It is the < PROPFEMALE > to every wand'ring bark , Whose worth's unknown , although his heighth be taken . 
You cannot , sir , take from me any thing that I will\ 
more willingly part withal : except my life , except\ 
my life , except my life . 
this one time . i wrote something . and it sounded good . 
my morning jacket put on a very good show . :] 
freaking tired and it's only 2:30 so 5 1/2 hours at work left , then hair cut . then home to an empty house ... well < PROPFIRST > will be there , but no < PROPFIRST > :[

Our children are the worst victims of our Psychiatric Civilization . They are being taught they have broken brains instead of broken families , broken schools , and broken communities . Feeling disempowered as parents and teachers , we leave our children looking for love in all the wrong places , and when they flounder , we send them off for \medication . \ " - Dr. < PROPFIRST > Breggin "

The amount of happiness that you have depends on the amount of freedom you have in your heart . - Thich Nhat < PROPFEMALE > 
Gratefulness is the key to a happy life that we hold in our hands , because if we are not grateful , then no matter how much we have we will not be happy -- because we will always want to have something else or something more . - < PROPFIRST > Steindl-Rast 
rough draft done ! haha ! :] 
looking forward to having thanksgiving at our house on the 26th :] only thing I'm worried about is how much food to have . I'm afraid to have too little but I tend to make too much food most of the time . Oh well ! 
life can be anything you want it to be , but only within the scope of life that you're living . idk what that means 100% and I don't know if I fully agree but I think maybe that's right . comments ? 
Life can be anything you want it to be but you can only do that which is in your scope of life . Maybe I believe this but I'm not 100% sure what it means . I always thought your only restriction is that of self . comments ? 
\Career is a feminist lie . Since when are careers the source of human fulfillment ? What is so great about being an Assistant < PROPFEMALE > Manager at a bank ? Is society expected to provide legions of eager feminists with \ " fulfilling\ " careers to compensate for their loveless lives ? \"" 
mcr ftw 
what would you do if you were fearless ?

Most women set out to try to change a man , and when they have changed him they don't like him . < PROPFEMALE > Dietrich

Have had a twitter account for over a year . Used it the first time today . Haha send me your name so I can follow you . 
Also , I feel retarded in gym clothes , and some guy just had to tell me how to exit the gym so I guess I am retarded . I was writing this when it happened .

I need to have a conversation about life . and not about my life but just life . like the old days on the back porch . What Happened ?! is my life so interesting that I got caught up in me ? no wonder !! I got twisted up in everything I knew I would never care about . LIFE IS LIFE . LIVE . :] 
note to self : if < PROPFIRST > comes back inside before going to work and warns me that it's treacherous outside don't: 1 ) wear heels 2 ) lay in bed where it's warm instead of going to start your car 3 ) think its going to take less then 30 minutes to get out of the driveway and finally 4 ) assume he's exaggerating even in the slightest 
if it takes the employees 30 plus minutes to get to the store why do we think anyone else is going to bother to show up to buy anything ? idk crossing my fingers . 
A recent study published in Science of the Total Environment reports that at least 50 chemical compounds used in packaging are capable of interfering with hormones by leaching into the food supply . These include bisphenol A ( BPA ) , which mimics estrogen , and phthalates , which block the production of testosterone . Toxic chemical food contamination is feminizing men , though how much is not clear .

Put this on your status if you know someone ( or are related to someone ) who has been eaten by dragons . Dragons are nearly unstoppable and , in case you didn't know , they can also breathe fire . 93% of people won't copy and paste this , because they have already been eaten by dragons . 6% of people are sitting in the shower armed with fire extinguishers and the remaining 1% are awesome and will repost .
