Some relationships are like < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > . They tease each other , knock each other down , irritate each other , but can't live with out each other ... Yeeeeah , it's kind of like that . 
Watching College Football Live on ESPN as they replay our bowl game and dissect our season and program . * sigh

Surprisingly my car started , but it didn't want to . It kept asking me \Are you sure ? Are you sure ? \"" 
My feet hurt so bad from dancing so much last night , worse than any D*Funk night . 
Is some kind of wonderful . 
Me : I hear the TV buzzing . Are you guys watching TV ? Cyrus : No we not watching TV . Maybe it's your brain talking . baaaaahahahahahaha Pure comedy from this kid ! 
Well those cookies & energy drink did the opposite of what I wanted . 
Unfortunately housework still needs to be done on a sick day ... 
Thank-you Lord for filling up my night & Saturday , I just really don't feel good . 
Things could be worse . 
I think that bending over & ripping a hole in the butt of my jeans would be the < PROPFEMALE > on top of this ice cream sundae of a day ! 
BRAND NEW DAY , first thing I'm putting on is my smile ! 
It's my momma's birfday . If you're friends with her , wish < PROPFIRST > Staley a happy birthday . :) 
Trying to figure out supper with going to the grocery store . No milk or bread . Noodles & butter ?

I'd settle for a slow down . It seems everything is going 100mph & no progress is being made . EXHAUSTED ! 
... They think we're lovers kept under cover , I just ignore it , but they keep saying we laugh just a little too loud , we stand just a little too close , we stare just a little too long . Maybe they're seeing something we don't , darlin ' ... 
I'm thankful for my Grandpa who is letting me borrow one of their cars so I don't have to drive my dad's truck . & my Grandma who made a batch of fabulous cinnamon rolls & buns just for me ! <3

Sheet Rock Hills may have a scandal in the making . < PROPFIRST > may have the hots for Manny , but Manny doesn't see her as anything more than a friend at the hardware store that always has the supplies he needs . Stuck in the friend zone .
