Found the reason < PROPFIRST > has not yet chosen a dominant hand . He doesn't need to . He can use both well . We were cutting out Memory cards from the memory game , and instead of turning the piece , he just switched the hand the scissors were in ! LOL ! and you couldn't tell the difference . 

DEADLY TERMS USED BY WOMEN : 1 . FINE : This is the word women use to end an argument when they KNOW they are right and you need to shut up ; 2 . NOTHING : This means SOMETHING and you should be wary ; 3 . GO AHEAD : This is a dare , NOT permission . DON'T DO IT ! 4 . WHATEVER : A woman's way of saying F*YOU ! 5 . THAT'S OK : She's thinking long and hard before deciding HOW and WHEN you WILL pay for your mistake ! Repost - SAVE a life 
So Zander rode his big wheel all by himself for quite a ways tonight ! LOVED IT ! He was so proud of himself ! Think we might be going on a bike/walk here soon ! 
sooo ... learned how to make tortellini tonite . < PROPFIRST > helped me every step of the way ! He loves tortellina he said ! Can't wait to try them tomorrow night at Miss < PROPFEMALE>'s!
