DEADLY TERMS USED BY A WOMAN :( 1 ) \FINE \"- the word women use to end an argument when they know they are RIGHT & YOU need to SHUT UP . ( 2 ) \ " NOTHING \"- means SOMETHING & u need to be WORRIED ( 3)\ " GO AHEAD \"- this is a not permission DO NOT DARE DO IT . ( 4 ) \ " WHATEVER\ " - is a woman's way of saying F**K YOU . ( 5 ) \ " THAT'S OK \"- MEANS NOT OK . She is thinking long & hard on HOW & WHEN you will pay for your mistake . Re-post if u agree . " 
Thank you everyone for the birthday wishes ! I forgot about it until I clocked in at work and it showed Happy Birthday ! on the screen .
