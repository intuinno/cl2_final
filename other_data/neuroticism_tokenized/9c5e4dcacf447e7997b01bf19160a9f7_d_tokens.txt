So I most definately am talking to my councler tomorrow . :) and mrs p . :) 
I really need to read . 
Today feels like it is gonna be a good day . :) 
goodness this musical has to be done by tomorrow for advanced theatre .... I feel like we are behind . And half of the songs dont have kareoke tracks ... guess we are going acapella . 
Oh advanced theatre ... my relationship with you is a love/hate . 
Reminder for show choir ... plain black shorts and solid colored shirts ... GOOD DAY MLK TODAY !! 
So tired , but I need to take a shower . Laziness corrupts this path . 
Make babies with your friends app ... boss ... me and < PROPFEMALE > would have cute children XD 
So myfriends say I will end up marrying the one I have loved for so long . Thank you for your concern ... but I am the last person to have that romantic love story . (: 
You taste like heaven , but God knows you're built for sin . 
The world is dyed with the color of blood . It will never be able to go back to the way it was before . 
My off day is almost here (: but my mom says my stomache has most likely shrunk from this diet . 
Soon the rain will wash away the sun , as I melt with you . - I am Ghost 
Finally ... I slept in . (: 
To Magic Mountain ... no rides :D sounds nice . (: Ima gamble . 
HELL WEEK o-o 
Theatre is going to turn me into a sleeping monster this week . o-o I'd steer clear of me . 
There's a sick little suicide , in all that we do . You decide , which ones for you . 
A withered past and a blurry future , my heart's on an auction , and it goes out to the highest bid . 
The truths that we all tried to hide are so much clearer when it's not our lives , when we don't face the blame . 
Shallow hearts and shallow minds , you can't just have one , but both combined . 
< PROPFEMALE > set build today ... time to paint the stage once again . It has been my job for the 4 years . 
I'm so tired ): 
I wanna go to Japan !! The cheapest you can get there and stay there is 900 bucks . (: 
Rehearsal time . 
Opening night is over with ... and I got five hours of sleep . Not my cup of tea -_- 
Anyone think they can give me a ride to school tomorrow who is in < PROPFEMALE > ? 
Goodness ... I know I will regret saying this .. but I can't wait for highschool to end ... I really want to start auditioning for cruise lines . (: 
So I am trying to change my name back to < PROPFEMALE > ... but facebook wont let me ..... I've tryed atleast 7 times and then it changed it back to this -_- I am angry . 
Call time is five right ? 
FullName : ________ Age : _____ Birthday : __________ Nickname : _________ Favorite Food : ___________ Favorite Color : __________ bestfriend : _________ Post this as your status , and see who knows you best !!

I am learning how to drive XP 
Disney land with my family and < PROPFIRST > ^-^ 
A shower right now is out of the question . -_- 
So ... in complete honesty , I do not like Shakespeare . It is really easy to learn and follow , but it is really boring . -_- 
.................. -_- 
Let me see you stripped down to the bone . 
Pain in your eyes , makes me cruel , makes me spiteful . Tears are delightful , welcome your nightfall . How winter kills . I tear at you , searching for weaker seams . 
My Chemical Romance's Danger Days is finally here !!!!!!!!! :D KILLJOYS !! ^-^ 
KillJoys , MAKE SOME NOISE !! Boom Chicka Boom . 
I found my Choir Barbeque Song . It may be sad in the movie ... but it can easily be changed with a smile . ^-^ 
Kids with special needs aren't sick or gross . There is no need to make fun of them . They only want what we all want- to be accepted . Can I make a request ? Is anyone willing to post this and leave it on your status for at least 1 hour ? It is Special Education week , and this is in honor of all children made in a unique way 
Heh ... I am overwhelmed with all the happy birthdays ... I blame facebook . But honestly , thankyou everyone . (: 
103 Happy Birthdays ... I only thought I would get only ten at the most . I've been proven wrong . Thank you everyone . I had an amazing day with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > , and thanksgiving is tomorrow . (: Such an amazing week so far . ^-^ 
120 Happy Birthdays .... wow . o-o Happy Thanksgiving everyone . ^-^ 
So I finally saw < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim ... it was okay . I guess I didnt get the whole effect because everyone kept talking about it and made it sound like the best thing since sliced bread . It was good but it wasnt the best . (: 
So I had fun ... passed out on my bed when I got home . I really like the drive in movies , because you can talk and watch the movie without anyone bugging you about it . (: 
Shakespeare is quite hard to memorize , but I think I am ready for tomorrow if I go . (: 
So < PROPFEMALE > had a fairly sad and abrupt death this morning ... we don't know how she died , but I hope she rests in peace with Chewy < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > . (: 
I need a good tempoed song to tap dance , too , that would appeal to those of my age group today .... and go ! 
Change your facebook profile picture to a cartoon from your childhood and invite your friends to do the same . Until Monday ( Dec . 6 ) , there should be no human faces on Facebook , but an invasion of memories . This is in protest for violence against children . Please spread the word . 
I changed my picture to < PROPFEMALE > from Sabans Adventures of the Little Mermaid . (:

I have such a bad headache .... I am sleep deprived . 
Tap dance for auditions ... I have two options with music or acapella ? 
Winter lovers having a blast ...? /: So many new relationships . o-o 
One word to describe < PROPFEMALE > -- Bashful . 
I love movie/tv soundtracks . (: 
Oh ... my gawd . Bernedette Peters is 61 years old .... she must've had alot of work done . She looks like she is 40 . 
Aunt : Do you hear running water ? \ 
Me : * listens * I think that's someone going to the bathroom . \ 
This conversation made my day . My family is funny . XP 
So seriously ... who wants to do spice up your life for choir barbeque ? I need four girls :)

To make things clear ... the old dates of that stupid zodiac is wrong from December 22nd is a capricorn ... I know this for a fact ... :/ 
Dreaming about Flavio Archila falling flat on his face at an ice skating rink ... bahahahahahahaha . XD 
Every soul who is holding the end is near signs ... you know what's up . 
I'd catch a grenade for ya , throw it back at yo face for ya . :D 
Nightmare lastnight ... /: Trust me it wasnt fun . I think I yelled at a few of my friends . XP So sorry if I did , even if you were only figments of my imagination . 
borders woooo :D I like the smell ... my sanctuary . 
So another nightmare ... accept this one wasnt humiliating . 
The Packers won . :D 
Hear your heart beat , beat a frantic pace , and it's not even 7AM . You're feeling the rush of anguish settling , and you cannot help showing them in . Hurry up then , or you'll fall behind and they will take control of you , and you need to heal the hurt behind your eyes . Fickle words crowding your mind . So sleep sugar ... 
Once again a nightmare ... I need a dream catcher , evil spirits lurk above my head . 
Who wants to go thrift store hopping for prom dresses ? :D I think it should be a girl date . :) 
okay these nightmares are getting out of hand . -_- 
I noticed I have a problem with sticking up for myself ... but the true fault is those who walk all over people like me . They are just showing the world what type of bitches they are . -_- 
Well you know ... I'm a ghost . Pull the note out of my throat and leave me alone . 
24601 .... :) Confrontation . 
First ... there is < PROPFEMALE > . Then ... Passion . Then Suspicion ! Jealousy ! Anger ! Betrayal ! When love is for the highest bidder , then there is no trust . Without trust , there is no love ! Jealousy ... yes Jealousy ... will drive you Mad ! 
anti-depressants controlling tools of your system ... hello nightmares . :) its been four days now . 
Okay ... I am about to change my status ... and I have decided to just do it like a band < PROPFEMALE > , and get out all the stupid remarks that may be said . No sympathetic bull shit okay , It always makes it so much more complicated ... if you do sympathize you will just look stupid . 
Love me , hate me , say what you want about me . 
I think I like yearly horoscopes better than day by day ... it gives you some encouragement . :) 
I share a birthday with an actress ... < PROPFEMALE > Heigl . Fun Fact ! ^-^ 
I love my family . :) 
I need a ride to school !!! can someone help me out !? 
I really miss my friends . /: I like ranting to them . :)

So .... I had my wisdom teath pulled ... it feels like canker sour . Its not that bad . 
Some guy sent me a friend request on facebook that said this . \Can you give me directions ... to your heart ? \ " XD " 
Brush me to the side I am only a speck of dust . Throw me away for I am only the apple core . I am not your water that you need and lust , or the fun facts on your cap of Snapple in august . Now try not to be such a bore , love , but you are the unwanted crust . 
hopefully this is a twenty four hour flu ... any medicine suggestions ? 
Its funny how people predict why I am not at school ... why don't you just ask ? 
I wish stomaches weren't important .... i'd get mine removed . -_- 
\I could've been one of the most Notorious . \ " -- Turbulence " 
\Thinking that my words are pure 
\Marina ... your face is glowing today . o-o \ " < PROPFEMALE > Luree Green " 
Without the mask , where will you hide ? Can't find yourself lost in your lies . -- this lyric represents the sole society :) 
Look here she comes now , bow down and stare in wonder . Oh , how we love you , no flaws when your pretending . And now I know she never was and never will be . -- gosh this song is amazing . :) 
\I'll be waiting with a gun and a pack of sandwiches\ " I think I just fell in love with Radiohead ... " 
I think I'm gonna wear my choir shirt that < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > Pertz made tomorrow , along with < PROPFEMALE > Hegenbart bows she made us . 
Go to your profile . The first 5 friends in the sidebar are your team for the Zombie Apocalypse . How screwed are you ? \ 
< PROPFEMALE > Smith , < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > , Naomie Winch , < PROPFEMALE > Stevenson , and Kishore K Mukherjee . Oh dear .... I think Kishore and < PROPFEMALE > are the best I got XD 
Last driving lesson ... I feel very confident in my driving . After this its time to party hard at my grampas :) 
Hawaii got it pretty bad ... and a little part of california is somewhat destroyed ... and yeah japan got it terribly ... but honestly ... one place shouldnt get all the sympathy . Be equally sympathetic to the world if you want to , \pray \"." 
I just watched the movie Hachi ..... it was a really cute/sad story ): 
for once ... a nice long decent sleep :) 
I miss Zach Morrissey and < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Campbell . ): 
Silence speaks loud and clear . 
.. 
like my status ! 
Someone attacked my phone ... who could it be ... I didn't post those last two statuses .... 
Darling ... what is going on ? Honestly that never happened lying is your favorite passion . Leave me and go where you belong ; higher heels and lipstick napkins . Dying is your latest fashion . 
who is going to grad night ? if I am too go I need to know if there are people I can be with 
When you go would you have the guts to say I don't love you like I did yesterday ? 
I didnt know < PROPFIRST > was < PROPFEMALE>'s sister . o-o She was always the daughter in my eyes !! Childhood dreams crushed ! 
Guys ... guys ... 36 more days . :) But technically 31 , not including the last week of school being the graduation preparations . So ... ONE MONTHE !! :D

Beach ... heck yeah !!! 
\Marina keep your shirt off and go ask those guys for wood \"-- < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Lomheim that was the highlight of the day XD " 
Everything will be okay in the end , and if it is not okay , it is not the end . 
I found my media monologue ... its from heavy rain ;) 
Success .... < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Hunt went offline :D 
\I've heard self-reliance is a virtue . Now you've heard it . \ " -- Cheshire Cat " 
\youre just attractive and fun to mess with\ " .... many people have said this to me lately . You know who you are . "

I am craving salad with maccaroni salad on top of it ... I think its that time of the month since I am having weird cravings ... 
I noticed ... I have a manly face . -__- 
Cant wait till this scene of my life fades ... I need a second < PROPMALE > to start over . 
Confession ... thingy . I guess you can like my status ... 
No one speaks , not one word , but what words are in our eyes ? Silence speaks loud and clear , all the words we dont want to too hear . 
Tremble at the sound and watch the blood trace down my unforgiving face . Grasp the sheets beneath and feel that blade fall deep into my quaking heart . 
Pretty please no negativity today :) I'm not in the mood . ;) 
If I suddenly lost my memories would I still be the same as I am now ? Or , would my experiences , trials , tribulations , relationships , and so on add up to more than personality and character I was born with . Each individual is born like this , but you are who you were born to be . -- my horoscope ... really brightens my day :) 
Hmmm ... the question is ... who is < PROPFEMALE > really ? 
Romanos was yummy ... I am so happy I went there . SOOOOOOOOOO GOOD !!! 
Envy is ever joined with the comparing of a man's self ; and where there is no comparison , no envy .  
Hehe ... I had alot of fun with < PROPFIRST > Gourlay < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > yelling at the television in Korean . XD It was fun XD 
\Be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind . \ " -- Dr. Seuss " 
To say thank you , is in recognition of humanity -- one of my biggest pet peeves is when I take the time out of my life to hold a door open for a stranger and they don't even say thank you . -_- 
Even if the morrow is barren of promises\ 
Nothing shall forestall my return\ 
To become the dew that quenches the land\ 
To spare the sands , the seas , the skies\ 
I offer thee this silent sacrifice 
My friend , the fates are cruel . There are no dreams , no honor remains , the arrow has left the bow of the goddess . My soul , corrupted by vengeance hath endured torment , to find the end of the journey , in my own salvation and your eternal slumber . Legend shall speak of sacrifice at world's end , the wind sails over the water's surface quietly , but surely . 
hmmmm ....... 
it feels like I've been gone for a week ... 
Being ignorant is not so much a shame , as being unwilling to learn .  -- < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > 
Give me malice , give me your attention .
