FINALLY ! I have a facebook . 

Today I logged in to my facebook account and found spider webs . It's amazing how I can stay away so long . 
Sorry for the delay , but I finally have my graduation poem posted . It's under \Favorite Quotations\ " in the Info tab and it's the fourth quote . " 
I'm at Tolliver Hall at Orientation wishing I had a working cell phone . : c 
Well , aside from one of my roomates going missing , orientation at Louisiana Tech is pretty awesome . 
I had an awesome time at orientation !!! 
still NEEDS to see Inception . 
I agree with my bro , the Red Ring of Death is stupid . 
Looking at prospective medical schools , preferably affordable ones . 
The Saints won 14-9 . Why ? Because I was born , and they're just that good . ;D 
I'll probably join < PROPFEMALE > Epsilon < PROPFEMALE > . I'd like to hear other opinions about it . 
Must get a red shirt for the Red Out pep rally . 
I joined < PROPFEMALE > Epsilon < PROPFEMALE > , but I'm still five dollars short of purchasing one of their cool polo shirts . Oh well , I have til ' the 30th . 
I will never go to another outdoor football game without some manner of waterproof covering . How ' bout them dogs ! 
Finished watching the second season of < PROPMALE > . Interesting how they inserted that line from the first Matrix movie : \I know kung fu . \"" 
I have to admit , Gumbofest had some pretty good gumbo . 
I am officially giving myself the nickname \Carmichael \"" 
I wonder what medical school is best for someone who wants to pursue neuroscience . 
I want to volunteer in hospitals , clinics , or anything where I can help people in a medical atmosphere . Ideas ? 
These are some rather obvious thoughts that just randomly popped in my head : \ 
Language is just a means through which we can communicate our perceptions . It must have been frustrating being an infant , perceiving new things constantly but being unable , for the most part , to communicate these feelings and perceptions effectively . 
What if there were schools that would take a child from elementary school through high school with an emphasis on a certain career such as a specialty in the medical profession , and after receiving that school's high school education that child would be able to enter directly into their career or go directly to a professional school ( e.g. med school , law school , etc ) . 
There comes a time in life when you walk away from all the pointless drama and people who make it , and surround yourself with people who make you laugh so hard that you forget the bad and focus on the good . Life is too short to be anything but happy . True friends should pray for each other and build one another up ; not tear one ano ... ther down . Re-post if you agree . I just did . 
As a future physician , I want to be one of the ones who helped eliminate the threat of Alzheimer's disease . For now , I'm taking baby steps by supporting the Alzheimer's Association . If you have the time & feel something should be done about the sixth worst killer in the U.S. , then please support with me . [ Check earlier post to take action ] 
What is living in this world worth if you never give it anything worthwhile ? 
Had an awesome time at Shriner's , seeing the smiles on the kids ' faces . I wish I was able to speak spanish though . 
After this week I will have no more Tweeting or ALEKS for MATH 101 . :D 
In whatever you do , if there's any value or worth in it , do so with a persistence as unto God himself . 
Food for thought : Everything that is real exists , but not everything that exists is real . \ 
Chow down on that Plato ! 
NOOOOOO ! MATH 101 has sucked my 4.0 away from me . I hate short tests . ; < 
Nothing comes instantly . There's a process to everything . 
In science , all the world's a classroom and nature is the teacher . 
An interesting definition of life : I think , therefore I am alive . 
Change\ 
your FB profile picture to a cartoon from YOUR CHILDHOOD . The goal is \ 
to not see a human face on FB til Monday , Dec . 6 . Join the fight against\ 
child abuse & copy & paste to your status to invite your \ 
friends to do the same 
I am ready for this break to start already ! 
I just lost thirteen rounds of pool to my uncle . I'm so embarrassed . 
I believe in Jesus Christ . One Facebooker has challenged all believers to put this on their wall . The Bible says , if you deny Me in front of your peers , I will deny you in front of my Father . This is a simple test . If you love God and you are not afraid to show it , re-post . 
Never be wishy-washy , or you'll be counted as a hypocrite . ( paraphrasing < PROPFIRST > 5:12 ) Nobody trusts a half-heart . Be firm in your yes or your no . 
\There is no fear in love ; but perfect love casteth out fear : because fear hath torment . He that feareth is not made perfect [ complete ] in love . \ " ( 1John 4:18 KJV+) " 
After finals are over , I'm gonna start working off all the honeybuns and hamburgers I've been eating all quarter long . 
Tonight I'm not gonna worry about school . I'm just gonna be takin ' names on the latest < PROPFEMALE > vs . Capcom . 
< PROPFEMALE > vs . Capcom 3 is awesome !! And to top it off , I probably have a 4.0 this quarter ( depending on when Dr. Hindmarsh decides to post grades for finals ) . 
:D Yes !!! I got a 4.0 ! 
I wonder how < PROPFIRST > Bieber reacts when he sees all the comments on the CSI scene where he got shot to pieces . 
Hmmm , continue studying or finish watching the third season of < PROPMALE > ? 
Got bored with studying , put on earphones , and started singing Grenade from < PROPMALE > Mars ... apparently much louder than he had thought . 
tried to catch a butterfly on the way from lab and ended up outsmarted and nearly stung by bees . 
Three of the cheesiest pickup lines ever :\ 
1 . Guy : Hey , how you doin'\ 
Girl : Fine . \ 
Guy : I didn't ask how you look . \ 
2 . I have just finished reading the entire dictionary , but I couldn't find enough words for how good you look . \ 
3 . If I were to ask u out on a date , would your answer be the same as the answer to this question ? 
< PROPFIRST>'s Ride : Hmmm , should we pick up < PROPFIRST > or spend another hour shopping for prom dresses ? \ 
< PROPFIRST>'s Ride 2 : HEY LOOK ! THAT ONE'S PURPLE AND SHINY !!! ' o'\ 
Five hours later ... \ 
< PROPFIRST > : They'll be here ... [ cry , sniffle , sniffle ] ... I know they will : _ c
