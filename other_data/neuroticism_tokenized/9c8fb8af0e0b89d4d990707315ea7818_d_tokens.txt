The joys of going TDY on your own : you get to eat lunch and dinner by yourself :) Fun 
Eating @ Shogun and reminiscing about the last time I was here . LOL I was so shit-faced , I ran across four lanes of traffic to get back to the hotel . I was too damn tired , and really didn't think of the high probability of being pummeled by a car . Good times :) 
Teen Mom is not a bad show . Its actually pretty entertaining . Damn you MTV !!!
