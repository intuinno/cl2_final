Domestic Violence : While you SCREAM at your woman there's a man wishing he could whisper softly in her ear . While you HUMILIATE , OFFEND and INSULT her there's a man flirting with her reminding her how beautiful she is . While you HURT your woman there's a man wishing he could take her pain away . While you ... make your woman CRY there's a man stealing her smiles . Copy & re-post if you're against DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
1 of every 10 people born is gay . That means 1 of every 10 people is instantly put down , given bad labels , left alone , put in a minority and so much more .. all for something they didn't ask for .

If you want to tell them life will get better and you respect them for who they are , copy and paste this , most of you won't but let's see the 5% of you who will .
