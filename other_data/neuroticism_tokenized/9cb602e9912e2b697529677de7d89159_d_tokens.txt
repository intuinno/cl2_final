so im watching this movie right ... and the guy hires a hooker , and she falls off a table . When she goes to the hospitol , her and her friend starts snorting crack in front of everyone . Comedy at its best . 
So im watching this movie right ... and ive been watching it ever since it came on . And the guy from the breakfast club is in it . And ive been looking at the tv screen for two hours , and i cant tell you what i was just looking at . i just wasted two whole hours of my life that i will never get back . 
So Im watching quarantine right .. talk about best movie ever ! NOT ONLY is colombus short in it , but EVERYONE dies in the end . NO ONE makes it out alive .

Downloaded an app of Cobain-isms . Reading them all . Most I already had memorized . Tell me something about the guy I DIDNT already know .

Animal Crackers in my soup . Monkeys and rabbits loop-da-loop . 
Eavelay rittanybay loneaay !!!!

Never console yourself into believing that the terror has passed , for it looms as large and evil today as it did in the despicable < PROPFEMALE > of Bedlam . But I must relate the horrors as I recall them , in the hope that some force for mankind might be moved to relieve forever the unfortunate creatures who are still imprisoned in the back wards of decaying institutions- F.F. 
Still waiting for it to kick in ..... When it does , stay away from me . I warn you , i will be a mess . 
Tomorrow .... then , it's freedom . 
A symbol of my past innocence . A realization of my present guilt . A hope for my future happiness . 
In biloxi wit some of the fam . Summer is on . 
Omg , the people upstairs are stomping , and the people next door are shooting marbles on the wall !! When did i die and go to nerve hell ??!! 
Home training obviously shouldnt be taught at home . Since most people don't seem like they have any .

Good thing the animals on farmville and fishville can't do some kind of stampede ..... i havent feed or harvested them in months .... 
someone needs to invent lighters that the flint wheel doesnt burn the heck out of my finger ! my thumb is scorched . im in my room , on my laptop , lights out with my bag standing up on my bed . everytime i look to the right , i think its a ghost , and i scare the hell out of myself . the laptop light makes it worse , creating a ghostly glare , that only shows the outline of the objects in my room .... why am i typing this ?? 
Thank you dear god for putting me on this earth\ 
I feel very privileged , deplomatic thirst ! 
is made of sugar , spice , milk , torches , eternal flames . Has the sight of a fly . The sensitivity of a broken tooth . the hostility of satan . The selflessness of God himself . Is as obsessed as < PROPMALE > Bundy . Is as diverse as < PROPMALE>'s Ark . is as loved as clean water . Is as appreciated as a blade of grass . is as regretful as Tiger Woods . is as creative as < PROPFIRST > Berg . Ahem , < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Berg . 
Hopefully I'll be one of those who don't age , but still feel drained like now . For no reason at all . Supposedly the cure is within , but all I see is broken items , hidden behind cobwebs that have been growing for 11 years . It's been that long , but as the ghosts still follow me it feels like yesterday . Today . Forever . 
Tonight was awesome . 
she's out of fuel , < PROPFEMALE > . 
Thanxxx to everyone who wished me a happy birthday :) \

If i can live atleast four times what i already have , ill be a happy camper .
