\Whenever I'm ' Facebook stalking ' someone - and I find out that their profile is public - I feel like a kid on Christmas morning . 546 pictures ? Don't mind if I do ! \"" 
Why does everyone seem to sit in the same seat they chose from the first day of classes ? Obviously , there are no assigned seats and yet everyone just sits in the same place . It's interesting . Haha . 
LOL - Swine Flu drill on Friday . Really ? 
Why do these professors continue to insult my intelligence ? They really underestimate us . Lack of attention and participation does not mean idiocy . It simply means I already know the simple information you're paid to teach .

A lot of y'all are still soundin ' like last year . The game needs change and I'm the mofucking cashier . 
Socializing , analyzing , realizing , and criticizing . I'm living and learning ; I'm mothafuckin ' aggrandizing . 
This new chapter , titled College , is turning out to be very interesting . As distance forms between old friends , that gap is filled with so many new people . I'm really enjoying this mix of nostalgia and novelty . Cheers to new places and new faces ! 
I'm sort of like a bomb , boom . 
\Knowing is better than wondering . \"" 
With some bridges burned , the lesson is learned . I'm done making excuses .

I don't understand . 
It's sad when you dread the weekend and can't wait for Monday to arrive . Two more weeks , just two more weeks . 
+ < PROPFIRST > Case = 1 
History final tomorrow , then freshman year is history . 
Why is it that , as a culture , we are more comfortable seeing two men holding guns than holding hands ? Just sayin ' . 
¡u ? op ? p ? sdn u ? o ?? ???? u ? n ? 
To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment .

Every person has 1000 wishes . A cancer patient only has one : to get better . I know 97% of you won't post this as your status , but 3% will in honor of someone who died of or is fighting cancer . 
Change is strange , it's true , this exchange of the old with the new . All you can do is adapt to the novelty . Don't let it conquer you . -NRM 
Brave New Voices . 
is in GRock for Tank's last home game and hanging out with the fam . Then seeing my doodielova later ! Peace out . 
You could follow the rules and do as your told OR you could crack society's corrupted , malignant mold . Those are your two choices . So , I'm asking you to take some time , with good reason and rhetorical rhyme , to think about what really matters . That , my friends , is why I choose the latter . -NRM 
With my other half . Work all day tomorrow , then it's back to reality . 
:) 
People make mistakes . Thank god for winter breaks .
