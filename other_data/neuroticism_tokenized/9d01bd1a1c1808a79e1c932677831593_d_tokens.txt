Having fun spring break baby ! 

still up i dont sleep till the sun comes up 
< PROPFEMALE>'s next top model ! 
this is way better than myspace :) 
cant wait to go to school :) 
i dont understand a lot of things , but i would like to learn . 
im seeing things more clearly , and things are clearing up . Somethings take time to fix , and i cant change everything . Life is getting better :) 
Today was fun , I fell into our school creek :) it was really funny . I also did an awesome job in Theatre Arts { I am the costume designer , as well as the make-up and hair artist } I am so excited for our upcoming play . 
I am so hungry right now 
hmmm okay today was weird and secrets came out . but things can be deceiving and things are not always as they seem . also one event does not define a person and who they are , it only means they made a mistake . 
you have to climb the hill to see the view ;) 
Some people suprise me , Cheyeanne :P haha 
hmmm I had a very calm peaceful day , I wish everyday could be like this . I know I can be immature sometimes , but im young and human . I know I make mistakes , but at least I learn from them :P 
Doing what needs to be done . Its all good though :) 
I loved today , Goodnight everyone . Chey see you at school , and < PROPMALE > get that bad picture off your myspace . 
Wow . I am up early , there is so much drama and stress going on , its really immature and annoying . 
Im so bored , math is so hard . 
Omg !!!! My grades are way better ! I am so happy , i have 1 A 3 C's and only 1 F , but its way better than before . Still working hard to make them better . 
I feel really dizzy . Anyway im bored , i miss all my friends . 
Today was so fun :) 
Some people dont know when to be quiet . 
i miss school and my friends !!! 
< PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > need to stop runnin there mouth , because this is a game they dont want to play . 
about to go to church with chey 
hahaha :) 
I cant wait to see my family .
