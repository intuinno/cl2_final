I don't know if I'll ever make this right ' cause I am just so broken by the bitterness of lonliness . And I'm so scared of this ! Every night she cries and dies a little more each time . Say you love me . Nothing left inside . Say you love me and the silence will set her free . 

Bored . I can't remember what I had to do for LA hw . Or geometry . Blah , I'll just do whatever . 
I woke up at 1:30 this afternoon , it was amazing ! And now I want to walk on the trail and get a smoothie from the big bean and then go to 5 below and get a red bull . 
is currently chilling with < PROPFEMALE > . She said to call her the coolest person ever but I don't like lying . 
Wow , it is SO not a good time to be a celebrity . 
Maybe it's not my weekend but it's gonna be my year ! 
Just got back from being awesome and annoying people in Sears with Samar . Now I'm bored 
You're only as tall as your heart will let you be and you're only as small as the world will make you seem so when the going gets rough and you feel like you may fal , just look on the bright side . You're roughly six feet tall . 
wants hugs . 
Yay ! < PROPFEMALE>'s coming home from Europe tomorrow ! She's bringing me < PROPFEMALE > >:D 
Stupid highschool ! They didn't even put me in French or guitar like I want < PROPMALE > and they put me in the year long tech < PROPMALE > class instead of the semester long one . Lame ! 
I need a shower but I'm gonna see how long I can put it off . I'll probably go take one right after I post this because I'm awesome like that 
Chatting with K Mo and Samar ! 
Being bored , I want to do something with someone . Call me !!! D: 
I need Redbull ! My mo isn't going to buy anymore either D: Donations are welcome . Will hug for Redbull . 
I need Redbull ! My mom isn't going to buy anymore either D: Donations are welcome . Will hug for Redbull . 
< PROPFIRST > Roday is pretty much the coolest thing ever . End of story .

Bored and watching Psych 
JOSHIE ! 
I dislike school . 
Everybody gets knocked down . How quick are you gonna get up ? Just how are you gonna get up ? 
I wish I was a little bit taller , I wish I was a baller , I wish I had a girl who looke good I would call her , I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat and a ' 64 impala

Have to do some stupid US Gov . essay thing . Bleh . Buuuut , I'm listening to the Backstreet Boys which totally makes it all better ! 
We missed you at the mall Joshie ! 
Never forget , there's life after death and taxes . Forgiveness comes and all of the rest is what passes away . Death and decay can't touch us now . 
Me and < PROPFEMALE > are gonna go to the dress rehearsal for the play tonight ! We're gonna pretend to be Joshie's siblings XD 
Just watched Saw , way flipping intense ! 
I really want a twix bar . Not even kidding 
El burro sabe mas que tu ! 
Funny the way it is , if you think about it . Somebody's going hungry and someone else is eating out . Funny the way it is , not right or wrong . Somebody's heart is broken and it becomes your favorite song . 
Thanksgiving break ! :D 
Happy bit me ! >:( And I don't care what experts say , corn snakes definitely have teeth . 
< PROPFEMALE > , so < PROPMALE > was awesome . 
The Jolly Green Giant is pretty much my hero . 
Sleep with one eye open , gripping your pillow tight . Exit light , enter night , take my hand . We're off to never never-land . 
< PROPFIRST > !!!! Can I have a samich ? 
You gotta swim , don't let yourself sink . Just find the horizon , I promise you it's not as far as you think . And the currents will drag us away from our love , just keep your head above . Swim . 
Gonna go to improv night ! :D 
I made a snowman and a fort ! Winter is intense .

When can I buy tickets to RnR ? 
Just ran like 3.5 < PROPMALE > in a half hour . Reeeaaallly tired but I'm gonna go to one-acts anyways ... after I take a shower cause smelling is not fantastic . Nope . 
Chorus thing went well . We were awesome ! :D 
Dayum , I still need to finish my < PROPMALE > picture . Bleh , I'll do it later , I'm gonna sleep . :P 
Mall with < PROPFIRST > and Joshie and Theisen and Victorious and Samar was fantastic ! :D 
I dislike studying . Not fantastic . 
You listening ? Okay , grass grows , birds fly , sun shines , and—brother—I hurt people . I'm a force of nature ! 
Dyed and cut my hair . It's so flippy and fun and fantastic ! XD 
If I could put lyrics from Nightvision by Daft Punk here , I totally would but alas , there are no lyrics :P . Either way , I like that song . >:D 
Gonna go to < PROPFIRST>'s play tonight with < PROPFIRST > <3 
I will wait for you as long as I need to and if you ever get back to Hackensack , I'll be here for you . 
Nuns scare me . But I also really like them . It's a hard relationship . And I dislike being tickled coughcough < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Magnesscoughcough . <3 < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > ! 
Soooo bored but the snow is ruining any chances I had to do something > : C 
I would like one of < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > McClame's sammiches . Hey < PROPFIRST > , next time we have school , a sandwich party is in order ! XD 
I'm the voice inside your head that you refuse to hear . I'm the face that you have to face mirrored in your stare . I'm what's left , I'm what's right , I'm the enemy . I'm the hand that will take you down , bring you to your knees . So who are you ? 
Sleepy . We didn't do much at the mall but play video games , eat , watch a movie and play at the apple store but I'm still tired . Shows how fit I am , right ? 
Oh mah jesus ! < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > McClame , my armpits smell freakin ' awesome right now ! Ah ! XD 
I am sleepy . XC It's only Monday and I'm already sick of school again . 
Can I wear a black skirt instead of black pants to the guitar recital ? I seem to lack a pair of black pants . 
< PROPFIRST > says it's weird that I sing in the bathroom . I sing everywhere else , why is the bathroom any different ? She's dumb . 
Just ate French food . Delish . See < PROPFIRST > Dirkz , if we bomb < PROPFEMALE > , we won't get the fantastic food they make ! That would be a sad day . 
Hey guess what . I love you . <3 
< PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Magness , ever since you got that double choco chip frap at starbucks I've wanted one . DX I want one so bad right now ! 
I remember when there were only 150 of you . Well , technically 151 if you are counting Mew , but I digress . I guess I spent the best years of my little life surfing Cinnabar Island to get 126 Revives . And I miss the Pokémon Center , I miss its music too . And the way that Snorlax looked like Lapras on water . Pokémon , what happened to you ? 
< PROPFEMALE > kicked me in the ankle . Hard . Ouchers . ;( 
Sometimes it's better when things aren't perfect . At least then you know they're real . 
Ah ! Why are people so mean to the < PROPFIRST > ? Leave my < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > McClame alone ! DX 
Blah . I want a zombie attack . Right now . < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > McClame , get on it 
Just discovered that < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Brown was right ! Yahweh is a personal name of God in Hebrew ! Dayum < PROPFIRST > , you know more about Hebrew than I do and I actually went to Hebrew school for a while . 
Spring break is boring . 
Just found a ton of my Dad's old rock albums . Way excited to go through and listen to them . 
Two tickets'll get you a tour of the fair . We've got a lot of ground to cover , keep up or get lost . It's safe to say that you've got no idea what you're in for , in time you'll see what we've done here . Hey kid in the back with the backpack , why don't you come up front ? Get up front ! Just give it a rest now , just give it a rest now you wouldn't want to cause a scene in front of all these people . 
Boooooored . 
Hey < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > McClame , will you get me duct tape ? Every color of the rainbow , please ! :D 
< PROPFEMALE > nevermind ! Hey < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Theisen , you can probably get better color tape than < PROPFIRST > anyways , she's lame . Colored duct tape , please ? :D 
Got my dress for the wedding ! It's not as neon as I wanted :P BUT it's still purty . 
Imagine all the people living life in peace . You may say I'm a dreamer but , I'm not the only one . I hope someday you'll join us and the world will be as one . 
Oh my god , right now ' The Situation ' is chilling in my head fist-pumping repeatedly into my skull . Stupid Jersey Shore . Stupid Guito . Stupid headache . 
I want it to be Wednesday . Right now . 
Got my hair dyed . Found out I've dyed it too much so the ends can't hold on to color anymore . Gonna get it dyed again on Tuesday with a really strong metalic dye . Good times . 
Gotta wake up for the plane to Florida at the same time as I would for school . :P lame . I dislike packing . 
Finally in Florida ! XD 
One more flight then we're home ! :D 
I am home ! Gonna sleep until 3 tomorrow and try to will my intensely painful sunburn away . And not unpack . Exciting . 
Gonna take a nap . Naps are good . 
Does anyone know when teen court is ? Everyone says they're going but no one knows when it is . 
I am , like , WAY excited for Friday ! 
POE with < PROPFEMALE > Lowman was awesome , I'm still proud of my answer of how a airplane moves . 
Going to watch Fight Club . Exciting ! 
I would like a sandwich . 
While I do love my guitar quite a lot , my best friend at the moment has to be my bass . I'll get into the guitar spirit and practice for class later . :P 
Got Colors Of the Wind for guitar ! I am very extremely intensely excited to play it for class . Not even kidding . 
He's mad with powuuuur ! :O I love < PROPFIRST > 
Do you want a banana ? Peel it down and go \Mmm mm mm mm\ " . Do you want a banana ? This banana for you ! :D " 
So sick of the hobos always begging for change . I don't like how I gotta work and they just sit around and get paid . 
For gov . we had to write a paper on a supreme court justice but the one I got was totally lame and boring and did literally nothing . So at the end , I talked about how he was from New York which made him cool and how he had totally boss sideburns . I'll get an A . 
Ewww , more tennis tomorrow . Stupid ball never goes over the stupid net . Dislike . 
Trying to learn piano too . Yeah ..... we'll see . : P 
Am I the only person who feels like a master surgeon when cutting the hair and little tumors off strawberries ? 
It's not that there are ever bad intentions , it's more that we've forgot where to call home . 
Cleaning my room so people can come over on Friday and Saturday . Good times . 
Got my phone taken away . :P Don't call or text . 
Was chilling and looking out my window with my music playing and RIGHT when the intense rain showed up , Rain by Breaking < PROPMALE > started playing . :O 
Dear < PROPFIRST > , I've got some things I'd like to set in pen . I would have used a pencil but leads just not permanent . Should I trust my printer's ink to express the things I think ? \ 
I'll give you all I can , a flower and a hand . I hope this helps you see . \ 
Signed , sincerely me . 
< PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > are genuinely the happiest people I have ever seen . It's pretty much fantastically amazing . 
< PROPFIRST > ! Noob died of old age !! XC 
Made cookies . Jealous ? 
You've got to swim , don't let yourself sink . Just find the horizon , I promise you it's not as far as you think . 
Went to the middle school's concert . The sixth grade made me both want to cry and punch things at the same time . They sucked at singing and they were loud and high pitched and obnoxious sitting . They better not take chorus in high school . Gabes would literally BEAT them . Not kidding . 
Hey < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > McClame , can I have a sammich ? 
It's the weekend , I'm sitting here drinking red bull , watching < PROPMALE > and big . Life is pretty fantastic . 
Can't stop listening to the Glee cover of < PROPFEMALE > by Kiss . Gah , I love Puck's voice . 
I would like to sleep . I'm pretty sure my sleep pills aren't working anymore . I NEED HIGHER STRENGTH MELATONIN 
< PROPFIRST > Whittaker loves Samar Waheed and they sahll be chillin in da hood watchin < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > McClames favorite show .. GLEE !! BE JEALOUS . I'm Here all night long !!! WOOT ! 
< PROPFEMALE>'s party was awesome . And helium is fun , but I don't need it . And NO < PROPFIRST > YOU MAY NOT PUT YOUR WATER BOTTLE IN MY VAGINA > : C 
So you like showtunes ! It doesn't mean you're gay , it just means you're AWFUL . 
Banana flavored moonpies are gross . 
I totally forgot to say this last night sooooo , < PROPFIRST > McClain Theisen's party was pretty boss . 
How is Germany versus Australia even a fair game ? Poor , poor Australia . 
Have to take the POE final tomorrow . Anyone know some things that I should study a lot ? 
Holy babies , I passed my POE final with a 74% which means i get college credits ! Yeeeeeaaaah man . 
I want to be a band kid . They seem to have an intensely weird amount of fun . I'm jealous for reals . 
Just watched the last episode of Supernatural . I didn't like it . Next time someone dies , they need to stay dead ! I mean really , everyone in that show has died like 47 times and THEY ARE STILL THERE ! Really ? I love you < PROPFIRST > but please don't come back from the dead . I will rage . 
Malling with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > McClame , < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Magness , and < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Brown but you already knew that from their post things , didn't you ? What you didn't know is ... Mickey's making me a sammich ! 
The tops of my arms and legs are SO burnt right now . But only the top . Like a half lobster . Fantastic . -_- 
If I had my own world I'd love it for all that's inside it . There'd be no more wars , death , or riots . There'd be no more police packed\ 
parking lots , guns , bombs sounding off . If I had my own world I'd build you an empire , from here to the farm lands , to spread love like violence . 
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements even\ 
if it leads nowhere ? Or would it be a waste ? Even If I knew my \ 
place , should I leave it there ? Should I give up or should I just \ 
keep chasing pavements even if it leads nowhere ? 
I hate setting these silly statuses which is why I have resorted to song lyrics . Lame . 
Oh my goodness why am I so freaking unlucky ? XC 
Just chilling in the ER . No biggie . 
All stitched up and better . Didn't die . Good times . 
Just woke \ 
up . Fun . What's even more fun is not getting yelled at by my mother \ 
because she went to work already and she will never know . \ 
Muahahahahahaha 
Is there a zoo near here ? I want to go to the zoo . 
I am running on Red Bull and Indian food right now . As soon as that \ 
wears off , I will definitely not be able to pull another all nighter \ 
tonight . Zut , it was quite fun . Got pretty far in The Mentalist ( season\ 
2 :D ) Had about six laugh attacks in < PROPFEMALE>'s room . Wrote some intensely awesome love poems . The crash'll be fun . 
Alright , so , was anyone else sent a letter saying they were \nominated for membership in The National Society of High School Scholars\ " ? I have never even heard of it . Sketchyyyyyy " 
Went boating . It was totally awesome ! 
Do you realize that everyone you know someday \ 
will die ? And instead of saying all of your goodbyes , let them \ 
know you realize that life goes fast , it's hard to make the good things \ 
last . You realize the sun doesn't go down - it's just an illusion \ 
caused by the world spinning round . 
ALRIGHT . I didn't like or dislike < PROPFIRST > Bieber up until now . Now ? He is my favorite . Not because of his music , no ma'am . Because he has Poreotics and Beat Freaks in his music video for Somebody To Love . Which makes him automatically awesome . Just saying . 
Oh goodness . Watching The Mentalist and the killer was a CLOWN . I hate clowns . So much . And there were many clowns . Ugh . 
It's thunderiiiiing . I love the rain . Especially storms . I'm excited ! :D 
Got rained on and indirectly puked on but still had an awesome time at the carnival with < PROPFIRST > M Theisen , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > McClame , and < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Brown . < PROPFEMALE > Lowman was there too ! Jumping around and getting soaked in the rain was fantastic . 
Doctor Who . 
Got the < PROPFIRST > Lennon biography . It . Is . Amazing . 
I'm hoooooome 
< PROPFIRST > Bartlett is pretty much the best movie . <3 
Hide and go seek in the dark at Samar Waheed's house with < PROPFEMALE > Morrison !!! <3 
Malling with < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > and Torious made me fat . Good times anyways :D 
Skittles are delicious , Salt is a sucky movie and I love < PROPFEMALE > Morrison and Samar Waheed . True facts . 
I wish I went to Warped : C . I want to see Alesana . And VersaEmerge . And iwrestledabearonce . And Mayday Parade . And Deas Vail . And Four Year Strong . And Of Mice and Men . And Bring Me The Horizon . And quite a few others . Damn 
LASERTAG ! I kind of fail . But that's okay because I was with my favorite people ! 
I love my friends . And Victorious ' house ! :D 
\You can't friend a dream . You can't download your first kiss . You can't\ 
Watching Friday the 13th ( the newer one ) It kiiiiinda sucks so far but we shall see . 
< PROPFIRST > Pilgrim is just as weird the second time you see it . Just in case you were wondering . 
Went and saw Vampires Suck with like 15 other people and it was glorious . And loud . 
Hey AP World summer assignment , how about you leave me alone and cease to exist ? Please ? 
Popsicles are extra delicious when your house is over 9000 degrees . Except not the < PROPFEMALE > ones . Definitely the grape ones . And kind of the orange ones . Grape wins every time . 
mall with < PROPFIRST > whittaker and < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > McClame was so much fun until my mom freaked out on me for coming home late . It's not like i'm dead stop freakin out mom . 
sigh i'm gonna miss staying up late ... stupid early school hours 
hi im samar i face hacked her < PROPFIRST > SUCKS !!!! 
I am done with my AP World assignment ! Or ... almost half of it :D 
Hair cuts are fun ! 
It has been decided that I have waaaay worse senioritis than my senior sister < PROPFEMALE > Whittaker . This could be a problem considering I'm a sophomore . :/ 
Giraffes do make noise . They \bleat\ " . Like sheep ! I have < PROPFIRST > M Theisen to thank for this information . " 
I'm losing my voice ! D: 
I would like to know when the first Key Club meeting is . Anyone know ? :D 
Pretty boss day with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > and Little Sister :D 
School . I dislike school . : C 
How am I supposed to illustrate indifferent ? :/ 
< PROPFEMALE > and I have decided that pulling an all-nighter tonight is a great idea . Lots of tea and supernatural is in store , methinks . 
I painted a double rainbow while chatting with < PROPFIRST > McClain . It is glorious . 
Torious ' mom makes delicious spring rolls . <3 
\Rules are the first step towards tyranny of the soul . \"" 
I'm going to switch from AP World to honors :/ 
Foooood with my darlings < PROPFEMALE > Morrison and Samar Waheed 
Dinner was delicious and when I grow up I will be < PROPMALE > enough to buy others dinner . And I will . Buy other people dinner . 
Why would you take your daughter to a place that she screams the name of while having nightmares ? And then why would you drive at hyper-speed right into a gate and onto a bridge while taking her to said nightmare town ? Silly . 
Just finished watching Silent Hill . I don't get it . Are they dead ? 
This French homework . What is this . > : C 
Black shoes ! White shoes ! Black and white shooooeeees ! :D < PROPFEMALE > Mataosky 
How odd . I walked onto the bus and instead of hearing 104.3 playing like usual , I hear \Nightmare\ " by Avenged Sevenfold . I'm okay with this . " 
I . Hate . < PROPFEMALE > . She ruined Paramore ! 
Hey you ! Yeah , you with the face ! Wear pink tomorrow yo ! It's all for the good of boobies you know . 
I think not < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Beck . I asked more people and they said there was no such thing 
Grape juice makes my life . 
Wicked Woods and ice cream with tons of people was freaking awesome . I'm sleepy . Goodnight . 
Oh my gosh , I have an idea for my birthday present ! < PROPMALE > Potter Lego set ! :D it has all of hogwarts . How exciting and amazing is that ? 
It's like pushing my sister over except more cow-ie ! :D 
< PROPFIRST > looks really hawt tonight 
You might have heard I run with a dangerous crowd . We ain't too pretty , we ain't too proud . We might be laughing a bit too loud , but that never hurt no one . 
My first cousin was born todaaaaaay ! She's really cute and I held her and she's squishy . 
If I had a nose , it would be purple and orange and it would be in the shape of a lightning bolt . 
Most girls I meet are quite savage . Always tryna ' grab up on my package . They say I look yummy and they want a taste but I'm a human not a sandwhich . 
Awwwww I love you guys ! THANK YOU 
I am not doing this French homework . : C 
Silly < PROPFEMALE > , puking all over the place . 
I think my cat stole my retainer . 
I am making a chorus of coughs ! A symphony of sick ! And it sucks because now my throat hurts . :/ 
I shouldn't have followed you anywhere ' cause anywhere's better than here . 
Well that took forever . But we found it , right Samar Waheed ? :D 
I'm sitting on my floor in 3 inch heels and riding gloves . The one good thing about cleaning your room after not having done so for , like , a year , is you find a ton of fun stuff . 
Fuck the world . Yes , I did just fling my new phone into the toilet while washing my hands . And no , it doesn't work . < PROPMALE > damn it . 
< PROPMALE > . Criss . 
Hey so guess what ? Samar Waheed is my favorite Indian . 
\I hate catchy choruses and I'm a hypocrite . A hungry hungry hypocrite ! \"" 
And I know you're gonna miss me , so I'll leave you with this ; you know that big ball of radiation we call the sun ? Well , it'll burst you into flames if you stay in one place too long . That is if the static don't get you first . 
I still haven't even opened the book for English , much less put tabs and whatever in it . Shit . 
Hannukah ! Day numero uno . 
Did anyone take the AP World test today in Goldberg's class ? How was it ? 
It needs to either snow or calm down with all this cold business . 
Have you ever put Red Bull in tea ? Don't . Ever . Ew . 
Wouldn't it suck if Red Bull gave you < PROPFEMALE > splints instead of wings ? Like , you'd have all this energy , except you'd also have < PROPFEMALE > splints so you wouldn't be able to get out all that energy . You'd just be hobbling ALL OVER the place ! 
Sleepover at Samar Waheed watchin < PROPMALE > potter marathon yayayaya !!!!!! :D 
They say there's a heaven for those who wait , some say it's better but I say it ain't . ;D 
I wonder what my teachers would do if I told them my cat ate my homework . Because earlier I found Tigger chewing all my papers . Hmmm 
< PROPFIRST > McClain see ? 
This IED project . Is dumb . 
Am I tired as hell ? Why yes , yes I am . Do I have homework ? Indeed I do . Sleep or homework ? Oh , I wonder .. :/ Failure ( and dream land ) here I come . :D 
My dad got me a guitar book about flamenco . That makes my life . 
If you want to talk , text me . I'll be in VA . :D 
Well that was great fun . But now that I'm home , I'm going to sleep . Until Monday . :D 
Does anyone who has Mrs Sexton know if we have to do the entire Midterm Exam review packer for homework ? 
I need to know if there will be school tomorrow ! If there's no school , I'm definitely not doing my homework . 
Just finished a double chocolate-chip frappuccino . It was delicious . Be jealous . 
Aw maaaan ! I'm now a Virgo instead of a Libra and I have a new , dumb profile . I will always be a silly little weight balance . Always . 
So how was that IED exam ? Yeah , not looking forward to that one 
\You look stupid . \ " \ " .... Thanks Mom . Cool . Love you too . \"" 
Cool , self . Just keep getting distracted and not studying . Great idea . That will definitely get us a good grade on our midterms . 
Amnesia . Yes . 
How can a dumb show for children make me so happy ? It's the best . 
How long does your script have to be for < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > ? 
I LOVE < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Magness and Samar Waheed SO MUCHH :)))) >:) cc : <3 
A fantastic way to end a not so fantastic week . 
< PROPFEMALE > Whittaker is 18 now . That's funny . THEY GROW UP SO FAST D: 
We tore our dresses and stained our shirts but , it's nice today . Oh , the wait was so worth it . 
OH MAH GAD . I WILL NOT BE YOUR NEIGHBOR IN CITYVILLE YOU GUYS . < PROPMALE > Vilasi < PROPFEMALE > Skull McConnell < PROPFIRST > Bolgiano < PROPFEMALE > Galloway . Silly children . 
When's the next part of < PROPMALE > Potter ? I want me some < PROPMALE > Potter . 
I can't remember a thing from what I JUST read in my AP World textbook . But I do remember that in a picture , there was a guy with a crown who looked like a fish , a guy with a sweet hairdo and elf ears who looks like a goblin from < PROPMALE > Potter and a guy with an extremely lopsided head but wonderfully straight beard . Job well done , I'd say . 
School . Really school . WHY CAN'T YOU JUST STOP EXISTING ?! But , my life is still awesome because I got me a < PROPMALE > Cobain biography . In your face , school . 
Can I copy someone's French homework ? I don't want to do it . 
I spilled the last of my fabric softener on myself so now there's no more left and I have another load to do ! : C But I smell delicious . So I suppose it's all good . 
\Go to your profile . Top 5 friends in the sidebar are your team in the upcoming Zombie Apocalypse . How doomed are you ? \ " \ 
Yeah I have friends but , they have friends and they have parties and I'm so awkward . <3 
Sweeet rain , knock out the lights RIGHT after I got in the shower . That's the way to do it . Jerk . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Brown . Was the pole vault created when some clumsy javelin thrower tripped over himself and flipped all over the place ? Words of wisdom .
