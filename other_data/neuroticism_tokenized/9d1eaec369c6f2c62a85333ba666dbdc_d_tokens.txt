I've reclaimed the use of my imagination . For better or for worse , I've yet to know . 
Raindrops on roses and girls in white dresses , it's sleeping with roaches and taking best guesses , at the shade of the sheets , and before all the stains , and a few more of your least favorite things .

Heading to the studio . Texts would be lovely . 
This place is so cold . 
you're stupid . 
I've got a blanket in the backseat of my mind . 
What's on your mind ? 
gettin ' down to business , mate . 
I saw the flames feeding a poisonous strength , worthy of fear . 
That was NOT the plan . 
I'm burning and i'm black in my lungs , boy you know it feels good with fire back on your tongue . 
I want you to throw my , shoes in the fire , and watch the soles burn , on the funeral pyre . 
< PROPFIRST > just backed that thannnnggg up . 
A man is capable of as much atrocities as he has imagination . 
The crashing tide can't hide a guilty girl .

When you look into the abyss , the abyss also looks into you . 
< PROPMALE > F . Heron is a bowl of fruit . 
OH < PROPFIRST > , NONG OH . 
Flowers are wiggles . Mountains . People . We are all wiggles . How much wiggle is A wiggle ? How much of a wiggle is a wiggle ? Always reduce any one wiggle into sub-wiggles . Or see it as a subordinate wiggle in a bigger wiggle . But , there's no fixed rule about it . 
People you may know : \Lowellsemos andscenes . \ " the fuck ? " 
and how you like to aggravate the ice cream man on rainy afternoons . 
< PROPFEMALE > is for losers . It's just a lame excuse for letting things happen to you instead of making them happen yourself . 
Happy < PROPFIRST>'s day , everyone . 
A good sniper fires between heartbeats . 
What's with the ducks ? 
It's not the word . It's the context . 
How do I say you're the grossest thing ever without offending you ? 
Wonder woman , how do you fly with such an ass ? 
:O = my face when I found out < PROPFEMALE > Minaj's ass , tits , and face were all fake . 
Fortune favors the prepared . 
Where's your very own chalk zone when you need it ? 
If I find a movie with a black ghost , < PROPMALE > Heron will give me 100 dollars . Who's down for helping me out ? :] 
snip snip , soon soon . 
< PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > . You are a sleaze bag asshole . And I mean that from the bottom of my heart . 
They say that most aspire to reach the top of the ladder . I just aspire not to walk under it and get bad luck . 
cherishing progress . 
I won't waste your time with my revelation . 
It is a difficult matter to keep Love imprisoned . 
You gotta be able to read , to write . Or so they say . 
watch your dirty fucking words . 
I love my boyfriend <3
