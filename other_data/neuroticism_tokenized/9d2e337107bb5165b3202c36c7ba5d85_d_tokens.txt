You can’t escape it ! We’re all gonna die , Just face it ! So don’t run , don’t hide ! Make the most of you’re life while you can ! Coz we’re all dying , Even if it is slowly lol a little serious you think 
it is the journey to your destination that makes you happy not the destination itself . teehee 
As society becomes more and more complex we as human , the most complex organism on this earth , seek simplicity . Is it irony or is it that we love to be diffrent and be individuals . 
As we are growing up we run into all kinds of new responsiblities . When we were children we would have shyed away from these things because they may seem like too much work , but as we are today we see them not as hard work but as a way to show not only other but ourselves that we truly are growing up . 
Emotions are a important part of daily life and without them our society and possibly our world would fall into total turmiol . There are three parts to it the very emtional people , the no emtion people , and the balanced . It may seem that the balanced is the best but without the extremist some accomplishments may not be around today . So don't forget about them . 
im on a roll today or this morning . wat ever . i have been listening to much to the philosophers . lol 
Some look forward to death and other are scared of it . For me im waiting for those few years before death because at that age after all the experiences you have been through you will not be afraid of death nor want to die but instead know what is wait for you and accept it . 
i love those anime where they make the main character look very playful but when he/she needs to be they get really serious and good

we all can trust but can we trust trust ? sometimes u can trust in thing but the end up letting u down and that is where the question comes from . trust can make great things happen or it can destroy everything . people never notice when it helps only when it hurts so they think it is bad to trust . 
what if trust makes something beautil happen and then something twice as bad happen does that mean trust is bad or just how we view how bad that thing is . it is a very confusing subject that i will leave up to u the readers to discover for ur selfs and have ur own opinon although i already have mine . 
can feelings feel physical ? 
828- 640-4588 . txt me when ever 
3 hour delay . we dont have to make it up and we basically have half a day 
Who is more foolish , the child afraid of the dark or the man afraid of the light ? \
