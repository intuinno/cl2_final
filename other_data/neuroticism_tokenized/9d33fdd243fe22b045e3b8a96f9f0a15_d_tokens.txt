Wisdom is what's left after we've run out of personal opinions 
another < PROPFEMALE > of wisdom ( and this one's a 2-fer ): don't make someone a priority in your life when you're only an option in theirs , cuz you prove what you love by what you dedicate your time to . 
* ahem * Every thought is a seed . If you plant Crab Apples , don't plan on harvesting < PROPFEMALE > Delicious . 
Before talking about someone , apply the test of kindness , necessity , & truth . Let nothing pass your lips without 2/3 majority . 
Give thanks for what you are now , and keep fighting for what you wanna be tommorrow . 
Always be a first-rate version of yourself , instead of a second-rate version of somebody else . 
People are like stained-glass windows . They < PROPFEMALE > and shine when the sun is out , but when the darkness sets in their true beauty is revealed only if there is light from within . 
Confidence doesn't come from always being right ; it comes form not fearing to be wrong . 
It's not who you are that holds you back ; it's who you think you're not . 
The absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence ... discuss , or just chew on it for awhile . 
I've found that the cure for boredom is curiosity . Careful though , there's NO cure for curiosity . 
Curiosity conquers fear even more than bravery . 
refuses to conform . You don't get < PROPFEMALE > when everyone's singing the same note . 
What you have become is the price you paid to get what you used to want . 
The only man I know who behaves sensibly is my tailor ; he takes my measurements anew each time he sees me . The rest go on with their old measurements and expect me to fit them . 
Growth is the only evidence of life . 
is excited too see Deadliest Warrior start a new season . WATCH THIS SHOW sometime ! That's an order . 
a positive attitude may not solve ALL your problems , but it'll annoy enough people to make it worth the effort :) 
Wherever you go , no matter what the weather , always bring your own sunshine . 
if you aren't fired with enthusiasm , you'll be fired with enthusiasm . 
Pain is inevitable . Suffering is optional . 
Smooth seas do not make skillful sailors . 
Adversity has the effect of eliciting talents which , in prosperous circumstances , would have lain dormant . ~ Horace ( Quintus Horatius Flaccus ) 
okay okay , i know i'm later than usual , but get used to it ; i'm back on my regular schedule now . that said , quotes'll be comin ' at you in 5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 
A smile is an inexpensive way to change your looks . 
Life is like a mirror , we get the best results when we smile at it . 
Strive not to be a success , but rather to be of value . 
Everything has it's beauty , but not everyone sees it . Same goes for people too . 
a teacher effects eternity ; he can never tell where his influence stops . 
we often take for granted the very things that most deserve our gratitude . 
the hardest arithmetic to master is that which enables us to count our blessings . 
the only people with whom you should try to get even are those who've helped you . 
genious is nothing but a great aptitude for < PROPFEMALE > . 
< PROPFEMALE > is the companion of wisdom . 
bring the past only if you're gonna build from it . 
Hating people is like burning down your own house to get rid of a rat . 
Imagination is simply intelligence having fun :) 
It's not what you look at the matters , it's what you see . 
Never tell people HOW to do things . Tell them WHAT to do , and they'll surprise you with their ingenuity . 
okay , world , you win . i have a cell phone . are you haaaaaaaaaaappy now ( sheesh) ? 
The only thing i hate more than the dmv is the invention of the frikkin automated telephone system . >=| 
Oh , BBQ lays ... why oh why must u be so addictive ? 
Ah ! I can finally see the light . FREEDOM !!! 
Will Farrell and all his movies suck . There ... its been said

Is feelin that this is gonna be another insomniatic night . Well ... at least i got my new netflix today . 
So much energy , so little to do . 
ROTFLMBO ( literally) ! Hilarious idiot moment : some dude got busted robbing churches . When asked why he did it he replied , \I heard you can make a fortune selling organs on the black market . \"" 
Looking foward to seeing how many Laker \fans\ " are left after they lose tonight " 
Yea yea yea , so the Lakers won . While y'all overcrowd THAT bandwagon I'm gonna start wishing for LeBron to come to Chi-town , so the Bulls can give me reason to brag again .

Wait ... I just realized that we just had a breeze meet w no rain ! OMG :O :O :O 
Up early . Watching the spanish channel cuz nothing else is on ... well ... that , and this Sabado Gigante show is making it very hard to do anything but watch it . 
Fcbk Moment of Randomness #2 : Don't mean to sound insensitive , but how tall is the world's tallest midget ? 
Fcbk Moment of Randomness #3 : What is the most quoted movie of all time ( that's been out @ least 2 years) ? Discuss . 
:\\ Plans for tonight fell through . Somebody holla at ya boy , ' cause I ain't startin ' my birthday weekend sittin ' @ home all night . 
The problem with the < PROPFIRST > pool is that there is no lifeguard . 
Facebook random moment #3 : what happens to amputated parts once they've been severed ? I mean , it's not like the doc just pops it in the trash afterwards . 
Thanks for all the birthday wishes y'all :) and a happy 4th to everyone ! 
Dear God of War 3 : Thanks for entertaining me today and last night , but I'd like to get some sleep now . That is all . 
I swear ... the earlier I leave for work , the worse traffic gets >=| 
Stupid humidity . Fell asleep EARRRRLY-eSPEcially for me . 
Friends = Relatives you make for yourself . 
Rndm thought #next : The weirder we behave , the more normal we look . Works in reverse too though . I see a person with 3 or 4 rings in their nose , and I know that there's absolutely nothing extraordinary about that person . Am I the only one who's noticed this ? 
The hardest choice in life : knowing which bridges to cross and which ones to burn . 
Just realized that this was my reunion year ... and I probably missed it . 
Man , bump this ! I can't find this stupid park . BHS peeps get at me on fcbk if you wanna kick it . The rest of y'all , see in 10 ... maybe

Game time , baby ! This should be one of the best we've watched in awhile :) 
Love is more than something you feel ; it's something you do . 
I don't make mistakes ; I make prophecies which immediately turn out to be wrong :) 
You can't build a reputation on what you are going to do .

Failure is not falling down ; it's not getting up again . 
would like to go back in time and shoot whoever invented the automated telephone system ... this is not a joke :/ 
While I'm on that topic , I'd also like to go back in time and beat the crap out of the genius -- and I use that term loosely -- who founded the DMV 
Be as smart as you can , but remember that it's always better to be wise than to be smart . 
Go as far as you can see ; when you get there , you'll be able to see farther . 
The joy of a spirit is the measure of its power . 
Whenever you see shadows , there's light nearby 
As we light a path for others , we naturally light our own way . 
The opposite of courage is not cowardice , it's comformity . 
Many people walk in and outta your life , but only true friends leave footprints in your heart . 
ready to do big things in KC ! Yeah Baby ! 
If you don't make mistakes , you're not working on hard enough problems . And that , in and of itself , is a BIG mistake . 
Don't confuse motion and progress . A rocking horse keeps moving but does not make any progress . 
Be yourself . Everyone else is already taken . 
Ugh ... cabin ... fever ... setting in . Must ... get ... ouuuuut ! :/ 
The love we give away is the only love we keep . 
Your goals , minus your doubt , equal your reality . 
You don't drown by FALLING IN the water ; you drown by STAYING there . 
Someone clue me in on where to find a good lawyer . DMV's goin ' down this time ! This bull crap is ridiculous >=/ 
Ever been so bored that every cure you can come up with sounds boring ? That's where I'm at . Yeaaah ....... :/

Ahhhh Snap . Somebody help a bruh out . Just realized I'm kickin ' it wit ' Mojo Jojo ... minus the genius ... yeeeeeaaaaaah ... 
5ish hours and 200+ consecutive frames later , my arm is done -- could barely put my jacket back on . But I had fun bowlin ' though ! Even met some new people towards the end of it all :) 
Congrats , summer , you've officially broken the tie wit ' spring as my fav season . Why ? Because you don't have stupid Daylight Savings kickback X ( 
Ooooooowee ! Did y'all see the Bulls drop 132 ! Ughhhhh , lol . Is this the year they give me somethin ' to brag about again ? I hope so . 
BAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA !!! Take THAT dookies ! I know I said you wouldn't survive to play us again , but daaaaaaaaaang son ! :)
