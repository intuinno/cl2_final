“The trouble with most musicians today is that they are copycats . Of course you have to start out playing like someone else . You have a model , or a teacher , and you learn all that he can show you . But then you start playing for yourself . Show them that you're an individual . And I can count those who are doing that today on the fingers of one hand . ” - < PROPFIRST > Young

To err is human , but to arr is pirate . 
Driving and I won't stop/And it feels so good to be/Alive and on top/My reach is global/My tower secure/My cause is noble/My power is pure/I can hand out a million vaccinations/Or let'em all die in exasperation/Have'em all healed of their lacerations/Have'em all killed by assassination/I can make anybody go to prison/Just because I don't like'em and/I can do anything with no permission/I have it all under my command
