Lips of an Angel By : Hinder 

HAPPY NEW YEAR !!!!! 
Photos bring nostalgia which brings me memories that I could never remember of who I was . What the fuck happened to me ? 
Nothing to do . 
Not going to prom . 
Whatever ... It's not like I care .. 
RIP < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > DIO ... We will all miss one of the greatest metal artist ... Enjoy heaven DIO .. you deserve it .. 
BLARGG !!!... On the bus , feel free to talk . 
Whatever .. 
\Light is what triggers the darkness in our minds . \ " © 2010 - < PROPFIRST > h . " 
\You can't intimidate someone if there isn't anyone to scare . \ " ©2010 - < PROPFIRST > h . " 
Got Ozzy's and AX7's new singles . Both of them are badass !! Especially with < PROPFIRST > Portnoy on drums for Avenged Sevenfold . 
Ugh ... I have only two weeks until school gets out . Maybe then my reputation will be gone . It's not that I care , it's just that I'm tired of getting shit still for what happened years ago . People just need to grow up and get a life . In these two weeks , I'm not going to give a shit about anyone anymore except for about 5 or 6 people . You don't like it ? Either talk to me about it or deal with it . 
New pictures going up tomorrow ... 
I'm very tired and hoping to get some sleep tonight because I have work tomorrow . Sadly , I think that's not going to happen due to me and this little thing called my brain that likes to think before I go to sleep . And I mean it likes to this A LOT before I go to sleep . 
Have a killer sore throat and a < PROPMALE > headache .. Someone please make me feel better ?.. 
It's rainin ' like hell on Destin !! 
Fuck off 
I could give a fuck about this school and it's people . All of you and your bullshit teenage drama can go to the ninth circle of hell . Now , I have no reason to give my time to anyone . Have a fucked up life ! 
Dude ... I can't eat at all ... I just can't eat period .. My stomach won't allow it . 
Can't sleep .... Talk ? 
Totally bombed the English Exam . the highest I would get is a 55 ... :( 
Is single . 
Morning ... -yawn- Did anyone watch my videos yet ?.. 
Last day of school ... period .. I never would've imagined it'd end this way . Somehow though .. I have been seeing this coming .. 
I ... I can't believe it . I'm finally done with all of it . All the teenage drama he-said-she-said bullshit . No more , I'm done with high school and all of it's dealings . Thank you though , to all of my friends who got me through .. Even if you didn't know it . I will miss some of the ones that I have left behind . BUt for all of the others , have a fucked up life !! 
Life's a bitch and parents are worse . 
Does anyone think they know me well enough to take my quiz ? Try it out . \

I just realized something . With me being a writer , if I spouted about two lines of randomness , people would be shocked as hell most likely . 
Can someone please explain to me why I feel like I'm about to burst into tears ? 
........ 
Not going to be on until Monday ... MAYBE . Damn you < PROPFEMALE > .. 
Happy 4th of July ! 
-strolls along for about a minute- .............. THWACK !!!! 
Be afraid , be very afraid . I have Hax torrets . 
Be afraid , be very afraid .... I have hax turrets .... 
Attention friends , acquaintances , or whoever the hell you are . Lately , I've been writing notes on this site and I've been thinking about making an audio video about them . If ... 
I don't know how to start this so hear goes nothing : I don't think I can take anything anymore . For the past two weeks of three incidents I have had pains that have forced me down to my knees and unwillingly brought me to tears . I don't know why and I'm going to go to the doctor tomorrow . 
I'm better now , glad I have time to relax and write again . Also , check out my latest post and comment please . :] 
Alright , I'm not going to be on for a bit after tonight so message me , IM me and all that good stuff . Anyways , I'm off to work . Later ! 
Guess what , I'm feeling extremely blunt right now and will answer any question you throw at me truthfully . No , this is not a forward\ 
or chain mail and I could give two shits what you do with it . Anyways , \ 
just ask me one and only one question you want me to answer and I \ 
promise I will be honest . \ 
- < PROPFIRST > h . 
Guess what . BIG SHOCKER ! There is such a thing as stupid questions . -gasp ! - Who would've thunk that people ask these questions ? -shrugs- 
Anything anybody wants to say to me ? I'm not going to bed for a while . 
Found my camera ... FUCKING HAPPY AS HELL !!! 
I'm not in the mood to talk tonight or tomorrow come to think of it . Although , I need information on a certain PS1 games that I can't remember the name of at all . I can only remember the graphics . Anyways , other than that , I don't want to talk . \ 
-Later 
Should I delete my Facebook account ? Yes or no ? I don't want any opinions at all . Just a yes or no answer . I'll be keeping score . 
I fear I have too much on my mind and too many things to think about before I start a relationship with someone ... Even though I'd give anything to have some one to hold and talk to . 
I have the absolute ultimate urge to go see < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim tomorrow . Does anyone wanna come with ? 
Okay people , I really wanna go see Scoot Pilgrim either today or tonight ... Does anybody want to come with me ? The reason I ask this is because I don't have a way to get there myself . 
I find it quite interesting in the difference between the words \Hi . \ " and \ " Hey . \ " when talking to a girl or when a girl talks to you . " 
From now on , whether you like it or not , I am to be known as \The Writer From Hell \"." 
Bored as fuck in my own home ... Go figure . 
I\ 
don't know what else to say now . All I can think to say is \I'm done\ " \ 
I've thought too much and took too long . I've ran away enough . I came to grips with the fact that I don't like who I am . As a matter of fact , I hate who I am and who I've become . I thought I changed in a good way that was better for me , but it's only gotten worse . I know what's wrong with me , but if I change it I'll lose what I've been fighting to keep ahold of . 
So ... Dream Theater for me is the BEST distraction from dental drills . WOOT !! 
So ... It has come to my attention that I will be turning 19 the 2nd of October this year ... \ 
Where the hell did 18 go ??? 
* Yawn * 
< PROPFEMALE > ..... 
I fucking feel like shit . My stomach part right below my ribcage feels like someone is cutting me from the inside out with a rusted shark-tooth knife ... Dammit ... 
Can somebody please give me feedback on my work ? I've been posting notes continuously and no body has read shit . I'm getting really tired of this .. I'm just asking you to do one thing . 
Okay , < PROPFIRST > LaBrie's hair doesn't look bad at all . I just hope to get a better view of it soon ( and I'm sure I will ) . For now , the picture of him on his Twitter profile reminds me of < PROPFIRST > Petrucci back in the early 2000's and I like it . 
What < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > character are you ? -- My Result : < PROPFIRST > Skellington . http://quizme.heroku.com/quizzes/86779/referrals/status?aid=100001105070608 
Goodnight all . Thanks to everyone who wished me Happy Birthday . And for those who didn't ... I'll have fun torturing you in your dreams . ( Jk . ) Anyways , I'll start on Waltz V tomorrow ( today ) and hope to finish it by the end of the day . Later ! \ 
Hey , can someone please message me when < PROPMALE > gets on ? I need to talk to him . 
I don't usually get sick , but when I do , it's like hell only I'm visited by Lady Gaga who in turn gives me a headache which if broadcasted , kills kittens while they are still in the womb of their mother . 
Sorry all . I'm trying my best to find time to sit down and type up \Waltz V\ " . I promise I'll get it posted A.S.A.P. " 
I honestly don't know what to say anymore . I think too much about everything around me and compare it to what I do . I also have a strange habit of looking back on the past way more then I should . I may just be complaining ... Hell , like I give a damn anymore . I never look onto the future and now I wonder to myself what's going to happen next . 
Prior to my previous post just now I have one request . When or if any of you ( meaning you who are on my friend list obviously ) please send me a message because there's something I want to tell you individually . 
So as I stand here and think I realize that I'm slight bipolar .. Only I rarely change at times ... 
You and I wake up in jail together ... using only FOUR WORDS , what wouldyou say to me ? ( NOTE : if you comment , you gotta copy and paste this in your status - fair is fair - play along 
I guess \slight\ " was just an understatement ... I must be theoretically insane .. All these years and this is because of it . " 
\How To Train Your Dragon\ " is one of the greatest animated movies I have ever seen !!! " 
I is happy right now . 
Watching How To Train Your Dragon for the second time ... :) 
Please put this on your status if you know or love someone who is gay . My wish for 2010 is that people will understand that being gay is not a disease nor a choice - people who are gay are not looking for a cure but ACCEPTANCE & EQUAL RIGHTS . ? Promote ... LOVE & Acceptance , not hate . ? 
Hey .. I've been thinking about something for a bit and I have finally made my decision . I'm moving to < PROPFEMALE > this next year . I've thought it through and I don't want to live here anymore . I've already talked to my mom and we've talked to my Aunt .

We are who we are . I will not stand against bullying like this especially when I was one of them . I survived , please help me in keeping the others alive ! 
I really need a strong personal opinion on something .. But if you're going to ask me about it please do it in a message . It's not an easy decision so I'm really going to need some advice .. Please .. You all know I hardly ask any of you to really do anything like this for me . 
Goodnight . I hope the gods help keep you safe ... 
Odin please .. Help me regain my sanity . 
Unwanted retributions of our mirrors . Show your cracking glass as if you were being dug out from behind the curtain . What are you again ? A monster of unuttered ethics ? A desolate feverish sculpture to be buried in sand when before the days of your eyes are long remembered . 
Attention everyone !!! As of 12:00 PM , NANOWRIMO took it's rightful place in the world ! November is National Writer's month and I am finally taking on the official challenge of writing 50,000 words for a novel in 30 days . My goal is to finish this novel by the end of the month .

Why would a guy at a grocery store hold two gallons of ice cream in one hand and try to take a piss with the other ? 
I don't know about you guys , but either I'm not into video games like I used to be or I'm not really finding a game that smacks me in the face so hard it makes my head fly off . 
Listening to Red Hot Chili Peppers at 2:30 in the morning . The epitome of relaxation right now . 
It's worse then I thought it was . What I thought was bi-polar was tri-polar . Yes , I read up on it . Tri-Polar is not just an album by Sickpuppies . Almost all the symptoms fit ... Really , all of them fit . So , for those of you out there who take the time to read this , you and me both know I am tri-polar . 
Bed , sleep ... Nai nai . 
Life itself rests on its own shoulders . It is in hell .

Seriously .. If I was black , my name would be Jermone . FUCK YEA ! 
Kiki's Delivery Service for the win !! One of the best movies ever ! 
I miss elementary school when you said the word \juice\ " you would actually be reffering to a drink you liked whether it'd be apple juice or grape juice . " 
So , I'm really starting to like a band I stopped listening to years ago . 
I'm feeling very demented right now . My mind is developing offsprings of madness and chaos . It could , at this very moment , produce very twisted images and words that you have probably never even imagined . Would you like to open the door ? 
Sometimes you just sit here and think about shit and a lot of things start to come to mind . I think too much in my opinion . It's probably why I'm where I am now . I start thinking about what's happened to me and then I think about now and what scenarios would come of it . Ugh .. Trying to live in reality is hard when there's nothing to do . 
And so starts my Mega Man Legends I Speed Run . I hope to beat it in under an hour . Wish me luck !! 
Watching old movies that I used to love almost makes me wanna cry . Kiki's Delivery Service is a great movie , I don't care what anyone says . Oh how I wish I could enter into that world . Then again , reality won't let me . Oh well , guess I'd better be thankful for what I have now right ? 
\So what's with the constant non-stop collaboration of nonsense on the streets I hear and speak and vice-versa ? I could swear I heard a little girl scream ' Brains!' . \ " - < PROPFIRST > h . "

I have already apologized for what I've done and so I'll say it one last time . I'm sorry for what I've done in the past and I'm sorry for the choices I've made .

Welcome to Hell my puppets . I hope you enjoyed your world while you were there because you're never returning .

Okay , can I please go back to when Myspace was cool , where I was role playing like crazy and had at least 6-8 messages coming into my inbox at a time ? I WANT TO GO BACK !! 
Something about today just feels off-balance . I don't know why , but ever since I woke up this morning I've felt like I'm in an unorthodox state of mind . I wish Saturday was here ... 
Okay , how about I make a quick poll ? \ 
Who does NOT want me to move to < PROPFEMALE > ? 
Everything you see in front of you is everything you'll look at when you're dead . When you're eyesight is so lost all you can do is remember the sight and listen to the sounds . When you can't hear anything you can only remember what everything sounded like and now can only feel . When you're dead and gone , the only thing you can remember is your life and how you lived it . 
Tell yourself to slip away in a daze . \ 
Forget who you'll become . \ 
Look to who you once were . \ 
Where do you remember ? \ 
Untold parallel contusions . \ 
Fuck the continuum . 
What happens when acid pours over your heart and bones appear from the inside ? 
Judging by the looks of it , I'd say you're one sick mother fucker . 
Beautiful day to shoot a bird up-close and personal with a 12-gauge isn't it ? 
So what happened to those shit-stories I used to hear ? Did they just die and move over to the next ignorant bastard with a brain problem ? 
Boy , you don't see that nowadays do you ? Makes me wonder why they were given the pliers in the first place . 
Ever wonder what it'd be like to get sucked into the engine of a plane ? 
Wanna get some crabs ? Then cum on over to < PROPFIRST>'s Sack where even cock-wrestling is aloud . 
Look , all you gotta do it cut off your own hand . It's not that fucking hard . 
I wonder how many bones would break if someone was hit in the face with a suturing iron ? 
Kingdom Hearts : Birth By Sleep is a rediculas game . The battle style is sick and IMO , the best of the series . I started on Proud Mode yesterday and am already at Lv . 22 w/ only 6 hours of gameplay . I'm rockin ' it like Jimi Hendrix at Woodstock ! I'll write my full review tonight . :3

Music is forever a part of my life . No matter who says I have way too much . It's what I live by . Music is the voice in my head . Music is one of the three things that if it were to be taken away from me , I would take my own life because I would not be able to walk through it . I appreciate it . It is my anti-drug . My three things are a string . If one is lost , so are the others .
