You'll all see it tomorrow , and hair grows back , so I'm gonna try to not let it bother me .

yesterday , i was on my way downstairs to leave for my cousin's baptism , and , just my luck , my heel caught and broke on the carpet , I tripped , stepped on my own foot and fell , rolling headfirst down the stairs . I now have rug burn up my left arm , bruising in my wrist and shoulder , and the spots where i stepped on myself is purple . I didn't hurt a bit until this morning . 
Went with dad and his friend < PROPFIRST > to the Rifle/Pistol range yesterday . It was alot of fun , but my arm is killing me . The 40 cal . ' s grip was too big so every time it kicked i had to work extra hard not to drop it , the fact that is was heavy didn't help . It seems Im the only one who likes the antique 9 mm , but it fits my hand sooo . The AR-15 was fun , i liked the laser scope . :) not much kick either . :D 
Killing kobold vermin on World Of Warcraft !!!! Dad finally set my account back up !!!!! Mwuhahahaha !!! 
You DO NOT fire a GENERAL in the middle of a WAR over a stupid ARTICLE ! It could have been blown off , seen as a mistake or a slip up . But NO , Obama went and made it a huge scandal and then PUT OUR SOLDIERS AT RISK BY TAKING AWAY THEIR COMMANDING OFFICER ! We have the right to free speach , and our soldiers have the right to LIFE !!! I'm surrounded by idiots . 
on my way to the hospital to ms. < PROPFEMALE > . they say she doesn't have much time left . pray for her 
wonderful dream last night 
went swimming with a five year old and a four year old . I was in the pool so long , that my eyes still see fuzzy circles around everything . On the plus side , i got my first ever natural tan . No lotion , no spray . just spf 8 oil . and i didn't burn , its a freaking miracle . 
My grandmother accused me of not loving my Dad as much as my Mom , so now I feel even more guilty . I put off coming to his house for BB camp , and now I want to leave a week early to visit < PROPFEMALE > . And the whole time I've been planning this , my Dad's had pnumonia , so I feel even more guilty for giving him bad news while he's sick . 
I now have 3 pairs of converse , I'm proud and appauled at the same time . I have a white pair for < PROPFEMALE > to doodle on :) 
is a stupid emotional wreck and I have to keep crunching on skittles to keep from eavesdropping because I know that if I hear too much I'll stand up and scream \Thats bull and you know it !!! \"" 
i saw Airbender today . The beggining wasn't very good because it wasn't as funny as the series , but overall , i liked it . 
missing him 
Attempted to strip my hair back to my natural hair color . I know its been a while since we've all seen it , but I know this isn't it .... 
after driving around town for two hours looking for fireworks , finding out you have to be 18 to bye them , and getting my dad to bye them for me , I found Assassins Creed PC for $10 take that console players ! 
My hair is Paramore orange ...... great . 
I was so excited . I was going to have dinner with both of my parents for the first time . But then my Dad said It would be too uncomfortable . He doesn't understand how important this is to me .

SAT/ACT prep class tomorrow at 10 am . I feel like making some jaws drop . ;) 
Dinner was great . Its wasn't akward at all . Both of my parents have conversation making as part of their jobs , so they never let it get silent . It was really interesting , especially when mom said \So what've you been doing ? Its been what ? 15 years ? We have a lot of catching up to do ! \"" 
I had realised how late it was , so i went to craw into bed and i found frankenstien under the sheet and I thought \so thats why it's lumpy ... \"" 
I Hate SAT prep , all it does is remind me how much I suck at math , and then kicks me in the face when I realize that I suck at english too , and I feel like crap all the time , because when I write my essay , i can't think i can't focus , my thoughts are everywhere , I can't take this . I feel like shit , all the time , and its just because I'm waking up too freaking early , I can't take it ! I hate this ! 
CRAP !!! CRAPCRAPCRAP !!!!!! I finished packing then realized i had no clue where my necklace was !!!! I can't find it , and i only wore it once !!!!!!!!!!! Crap , that was my favorite piece of jewelry I own , and now its gone , I've looked everywhere !!!!! Going to GA < PROPMALE > . Maybe the beach and cute guys will help ....

I feel like a bitch . Sorry . 
Mom turned Pretty In Pink on , and the dress was so God-Awful that I needed to see a pretty dress . So I put on my Homecoming dress , which led to wearing my prom dress . And now we are looking for shoes and jewelry . It may take a helluva lot of spanx , but I'm gonna look sexy ;) 
Have you forgotten , how it felt that day ? To see your homeland under fire and her people blown away . Have you forgotten when those towers fell ? We had neighbors still inside , goin thru a living Hell . And you say we shouldn't worry ' bout Bin Laden ... Have you forgotten ? God Bless < PROPFEMALE > and her people . Those who died , and those that live on to remember them . We are the United States of < PROPFEMALE > . We will not stay down . 
Listening to Five Dollar Refund's album Optimum at Best . \ 
Instrumental = good\

Put this as your status if someone you knew was killed by Lord Voldemort or any of his followers . As everybody knows , being killed by Avada Kedavra , having your soul sucked out by a dementor , or getting petrified by a basilisk is a truly tragic fate for anyone ; muggle or wizard . 93% of people won't copy and paste this . Will you make this your status to spread awareness of this growing threat ?
