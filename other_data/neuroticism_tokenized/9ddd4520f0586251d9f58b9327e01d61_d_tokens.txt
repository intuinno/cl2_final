We don't need wings to fly , \ 
All we need to do is aim for the ground and miss . 
Today is going to stink ...

Squeaky clean with a smooth face ! :) 
no roads , no longboarding ( ie . no waves , no surfing ) 
Anyone wanna see a movie today ?

Apples and Bananas 
Closing time . 
Day In Day Out . 
Longboarding is not about trying to be something you’re not - it’s about being who you are . 
New board is coming in Wensday ! 
Can't we all just get a'longboard ? 
The date for the Outlaw @ double Left is being changed to Feb . 13th due to weather complications . 
Anyone wanna do something tommorrow ? The weather around here sucks . 
We rise together 
We are the kids that feel like deadends . 
Brush off your shoulders , Shake off that rubble , Break free from your standstill . 
You can never beat remembering that there’s more to life than money and schedules as you feel gravity locking your feet into the board on a tight carve . 
You rely on someone else , to make you feel alright . As far as I am concered , its no kind of life . 
Anyone wanna ride some asphault tomorrow ? 
So I haven't lost ALL faith in Rocklin yet . Yesterday < PROPMALE > and I hitched two rides up Backside from a Fedex truck and today a Prius gave me a ride up Sunset . Hell ya ! 
Ended a hard day with a nice night . :) 
This is 10 ten percent luck , Twenty percent skill , Fifteen percent concentrated power of will , Five percent pleasure , Fifty percent pain , And a hundred percent reason to remember the name 
Skating was a bust . :( . Anyone wanna < PROPFEMALE > ? 
Oi . Riding bicycles is not for me . 
I want , I wanna get out of this town . O I want , Wanna get out and move around . You said , no mountains no valleys , You said , no mountains no valleys . Well lets slow , Lets slow things down . Let the silence spin you around . Where ever you are , I know the stars , the stars are comin out .

< PROPFEMALE > a crooked little town , they were lost and never found\ 
Fallen leaves , Fallen leaves , Fallen leaves on the ground\ 
Run away before you drown , or the streets will beat you down\ 
Fallen leaves , Fallen leaves , Fallen leaves on the ground 
Whoa .... I so cannot sleep right now . 
I love me some night skating . 
Thinking about dippin my Baby Blue into some acid .... 
Its going to be a silent night for the rest of my life 
Uh , What ? 
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough 
Yeah i'm sorry , i can't afford a Ferrari , \ 
But that don't mean i can't get you there . \ 
I guess he's an xbox and i'm more atari , \ 
But the way you play your game ain't fair . 
Look < PROPFEMALE > , another national disgrace 
Memory < PROPFIRST > for the past fews days\ 
Hanging at the pool hall with the friends\ 
Checking out the lights swapping gnar skate stories\ 
Ending it with laughter in the neighborhood 
O

I'm sippin on some sunshine 
I would tell you my story , \ 
But it's just beginning 
Would love to go skateboarding right about now ... 
Im'a go fill my mug up with some sunshine , \ 
Bout to step out and make this world mine 
Look to the stars for all your dreams , \ 
Look to the stars to watch my fall 
<3 ya Pete . \ 
You still with me every time I step on a board . 
I hate it when memories crack , \ 
Making me look back . \ 
Think it was meant to be . \ 
Realizing , \ 
You and me don't equal three\ 
I hate knowing you will never see this . \ 
See me , \ 
Plant a seed , \ 
Grow a tree , \ 
Become old , \ 
Live free . \ 
Goodbye , \ 
We had a good life . 
Roadrash , \ 
O how its been long since our last meet 
Back in da Desert

Pause , \

I'm sure on day you will find , \ 
That I got the benefit of time 
OOOO EEEE O AH AH 
Don't let the walls cave in on you . 
Night .

The stars will wheel forth from their daytime hiding places and one of those lights , slightly brighter than the rest , will be my wingtip passing over .

Going to Europe for 2011 , \ 
Super stoked !

\I got you on my radar \"?" 
Anyone down for some skateboarding ?

Greatness requires Blood , Sweat , Tears\ 
Greatness requires me to Just Be 
Skate that laffy taffy !

It's better to have pressure from peers than not have peers at all . 
I couldn't explain why I wanted to steal that fire . 
If you snoop around long enough your bound to find it\ 
For better or for worse that's how I learned to keep some things private . 
Mother just informed me that the water heater just broke , \ 
I really don't wanna take a shower now . 
My tounge's wet for the lunar eclipse , And when you're flat broke ain't nothing you won't do for a fix . 
I kissed a girl , \ 
and I like it 
The Good Times Are Killing Me . 
To my one and only lil MP3 player , \ 
Please come home . I miss you greatly and would love to have your music playing in my ears again . 
Ahhhhhh man ...... 
Well that was enjoyable ... 
Be a simple kind of Man

And my life is better than your vacation . 
I am so stoked for this video ! 
Went to bed with my head spinning\ 
And woke up with me smiling . 
Then there are women on bikes\ 
And women who straddle . 
I seriously have no interest in watching the football game today . 
May a squadron of beautiful vaginas find their way to your crotch by day's end . 
These are the days that keep me who I am , :) . 
I just got my frown turned upside down . 
Going into work early . O what a way to spend a Sunday . 
Who would turn down free pizza ?
