Here's to all the soldiers who have ever died in vain , the insane locked up in themselves , the homeless down on Main --- to those who stand on empty shores and spit against the wind , and those who wait forever , for ships , that don't come in . 

Anyone heard from Ms. < PROPFIRST > ? Or have an email . . . ? 
Is , home . 
Ooohhh , :( my poor < PROPFEMALE > -- just got back from the vet

First Day of Summer ... It's hot 
Sanity may be madness but the maddest of all is to see life as it is and not as it should be . ~ Don Quixote 
So tired of the straight line , and everywhere you turn \ 
There's vultures and thieves at your back \ 
The storm keeps on twisting , you keep on building the lies \ 
That you make up for all that you lack \ 
It don't make no difference , escaping one last time \ 
It's easier to believe \ 
In this sweet madness , oh this glorious sadness \ 
That brings me to my knees 
Question that pops up lots : Why is a < PROPFEMALE > like a writing desk ? \ 
Best answer ever - - - I have no idea . Simple . 
TGIF !! What an amazing morning it is ! Smells like rain , I see grey clouds . . . I know it won't last , that's why I'm going back to bed ! :) just because of the clouds- - -Have a great day everyone ! :) 
I guess I'll never understand why people insult the men and women that protect them --- Just because of the branch they chose to enlisted in 
Last night I sat in the waiting room\ 
The nurse walked in and gave me the news\ 
It's a baby girl and they're both fine\ 
An old man sittin ' not 10 feet away\ 
Just lost his wife and he said to me\ 
You've got a brand new angel and I've lost mine\

And we both wiped a teardrop from our face

The moment we stop fighting for each other , that's the moment we lose our humanity

I PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES OF < PROPFEMALE > AND TO THE REPUBLIC FOR WHICH IT STANDS , ONE NATION UNDER GOD , INDIVISIBLE , WITH < PROPFEMALE > AND JUSTICE FOR ALL . ( I grew up saying this every morning in school - it's a shame we no longer do that for fear of offending someone ) . I don't care who I offend . Re-Post if you understand the above statement . 
Going to be a beautiful day . . . In Stress Free Flag that is ! 
Hmmm- So I will be getting two tattoos for sure , maybe three . . . 
THUNDER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :) 
Staring out into the wild blue yonder\ 
So many thoughts to sit and ponder\ 
About life and love and the lack of\ 
And this emptiness in my heart\ 
Too old to be wild and free\ 
Still too young to be over the hill\ 
Should try to grow up but who knows where to start . 
Read over some old English papers ... It is clear I NEVER proof read them , my bad .... 
\What if I told you that everything I ever said was tied to a secret ? \"" 
Words , people . Words . There are meaningful words , there are pointless words . . . And then , there are words that hurt . 
Can't think of a whole lot of things more . . . Creepy , exciting and terrifying about the strange noises outside our house --- when it's dark out . . . 
Sometimes I feel like I'm seeing it all at once , and it's too much , my heart fills up like a balloon that's about to burst ... And then I remember to relax , and stop trying to hold on to it , and then it flows through me like rain and I can't feel anything but gratitude for every single moment of my stupid little life ... --- American Beauty 
# 51 --- sometimes , you're wrong . 
Ha . I'm sittin ' on my moas 
Had a horrible dream last night , not quite sure what that means . . .

What's on my mind ? One year ago . Yellow Footprints . Screaming DI'S in my face . FORWARD ! MARCH ! AND LEFT RIGHT LEFT ! 
A year ago tonight many people were going on with their daily lives and enjoying the simple life . Not everyone does that . Some give up tv , music , really good food . . . And their loved ones for Basic Training . Thanks to them I can play with my puppy and ride my horses- miss my band of sisters . Papa 4004 ! Thanks Devil Dogs ! 
Just realized that I was as excited ( if not more ) to watch Toystory 3 . . . with a kid . . . 
Happy Thanksgiving to all the Armed Forces everywhere ! And those on Parris Island --- Happy Thanksgiving to those recruits that want to be with their families too !
