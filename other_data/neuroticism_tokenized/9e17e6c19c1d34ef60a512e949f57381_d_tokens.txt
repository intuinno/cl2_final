I'm thankful to be blessed with all the people in my family ( including friends ) God has worked wonders in my life I am so thankful for everything he's done in my life . God doesn't make mistakes and how i know this is because i have the most wonderful family and no matter where they are far or near they will always have a special place in my heart ! 
This year is going by so fast that I can't believe it's already December . I guess hard work and dedication to your dreams and goals pays off which means over 5 months and ill be offically a graduate ! 
agrivated , frustrated , and confused as to why im getting worse cause i lost my voice ... 
Can't express how im feelin right now ... 
completely bummed cause im not able to hangout with my best friend cause im sick :( was lookin forward to it ... i hope i get better i really miss haning out with her 
For some reason I'm kinda just not smiling these days and i dont know why that is ... =/ 
Love isn't an emotion it is the way you show someone how much you care and will always be there for them to lend a loving heart and a helping hand and even from time to time a shoulder to cry on and a smile to brighten your day even through the diffiicult times . Near or far they'll always be with you no matter where you are . 
Would have been nice to know this all along but at least we now know ... kinda trying to take this all in but i can do this because I refuse to give up and waste my dreams away ... but even though i was right doesn't mean i want to be ... just keep praying for me ... thanks for all the friends , family , teachers . my mentor , and everyone else that has helped me out . Love all of you ! <3 
Pensive ... 
Needs a friend ... 
had fun thanks for making my day better . =) 
On Cloud Nine ! 
I tear my heart open , I sow myself shut \ 
My weakness is that I care too much \ 
My scars remind me that the past is real \ 
I tear my heart open just to feel ... 
I feel awful-I cant wait till March 11th 
Depression is not a sign of weakness , it is a sign that you have been trying to be strong for too long . Put this as your status if you know someone who has or has had depression . Will you do it , and leave it on your status for at least an hour ? Most people won't , but it's mental health week and 1 in 3 of us will suffer at some point in our lives . Show your support . -(i should know i have it ) 
Confused on the fact that I can be happy and be in pain ... i pulled a muscle ... oh well at least I'm happy =D 
Wants to go on a walk but cant cause of my pulled muscle and the weather 
So do whatever it takes\ 
' Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life\ 
Let nothing stand in your way\ 
' Cause the hands of time are never on your side ... 
I guess I was right all along maybe this is my purpose in life ... =/ 
Curse this freaking song ! 
Life is more than just the air that we breathe every second of our lives , but how we live until it is time for us to take our one last breath . 
HAPPIER THAN I'VE EVER BEEN IN MY WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! =D 
I posted my recent graphic < PROPMALE > pictures if anyone wants to see =D 
A friend is someone who knows the song in your heart and sings it to you when you forget the words ... but i guess you forgot the lyrics 
Many people will walk in and out of your life , but only TRUE FRIENDS leave footprints in your heart ... 
Why are we competing against one another when we could be working together ? 
Life is not who can be the best its about doing your best till its your time . \If Today Was Your Last Day \"" 
Wishes I could do graphics right now ... my pc isnt letting me ... 
Isn't it just funny how when you are in a certain mood listening to random music a song comes on and thats exactly how you feel ... happens to me all the time lol 
The heart is fragile but protected by love ... when love turns into hatred the heart breaks ... 
Dreams do come true you just have to have the strength to keep fighting for them and the passion to accomplish them even when the journey gets rugged . Just don't give up on the opprotunity to make a difference in the world and keep the faith that one day your aspirations will become reality . 
I am honored to have this once in a lifetime opprotunity to do protraits of my whole senior class ! thanks guys ! =D 
I'm thankful for everyone that has either helped , supported , and urged me to keep following my dreams and here I am turning them into reality all because I never gave in and never gave up ! So thankyou for believing in me guys I'm so greatful to have you all in my life . <3 
... =( 
There are so many opprotunities these days that we sometimes don't even pay attention to whats right infront of us or it's just something we never thought that would happen . Well , I got one that I can take a risk and show them what im capable of doing . This is where I fight for what I < PROPFEMALE > . This is where I need support and encouragement the most . This is a once in a lifetime < PROPMALE > to make my dream into my life . 
The Creative Center and them wanting to see my work ! 
My Interview with the Creative Center is on February 15th I'm so excited ! 
So greatful and thankful for having such a supportive family consisting of family and friends encouraging me to keep fighting to not give up and live my dreams ! 
??????????????? ????? ????????????????? \ 
It's Nieces ' Week ! If you have a beautiful niece or nieces that you\ 
love more than you can describe , copy and paste this to your\ 
status for a little while , but hold them in your heart for a lifetime ! \ 
??????????????? ????? ????????????????? 
Art = My Heart <3 because it is not just what I do or what I'm good at ! It is because I love the gift God has blessed me with and it is a part of who I am and who I am becoming ! 
Getting prepared for my interview any suggestions for what i should show them ? 
I am so enraged right now its not funny ! 
My < PROPFEMALE > is now finished 
If you have a Best Friend who has made you laugh ... Stuck up for you ... Drove you crazy .... Got mad at you ... Watched you succeed ... Saw you fall ... Picked you back up ... Cheered you on ... Had your back .... ready to fight the person who ticked you off .... and .... all these things made your friendship stronger and you can't do without his/her friendship ... Paste this to your status and see if he/she knows who he/she is ! 
Hoping that we can find my < PROPMALE > folders ... i cant find them anywhere .... =( 
\Without You \"- Hinder "

The song \ Beautiful\ " by MercyMe " 
Broken families create broken hearts , but God ; if its his will , can mend the hurt and take away the pain , and with enough faith , love can be restored . Even if it cant be how it was before it could turn out better just trust and believe in Him to get you through . 
My family ... i miss them all so much 
I wish this pain would go away because knowing that you are suffering kills me ... 
I miss love and am praying for you Nanny !

Friendship is the rhythm to the soul , the < PROPFEMALE > is life , and the < PROPFEMALE > to the lost and broken . Each friend is another note to a never ending symphony . ~ Leanna < PROPFIRST > 
If you judge a book by its cover you'll never understand or know what their story is about . Until you finally focus and read front to back without skipping any pages it won't make sense . Whether you read it or not you are part of their story . The question is do you just want to be in it or help them continue writing it ? 
even though your gone the memory i have of you will never fade .. \ 
<3 
Misses my best guy friend T.J.H ( Anarch99 ) 
I've made my decision ... I'm ready to give you a second chance ... just \Don't Wake Me\ " <3 " 
Gotta Be Somebody-Nickelback ~ <3 
All of us have a thousand wishes , to be thinner , to have more money or a new phone . A cancer patient only has one wish - to beat cancer . I know that 97% of you won't post this as your status , but my heroes will be the 3% that do . In honor of someone who has died , or is battling cancer now , or is a cancer survivor , post this as your status for at least one hour ..

Dear Mr. President , I hear you would like to freeze pay rates for soldiers starting next year . Would you also consider cutting your own pay to save more money for our country ? While you're at it , lets cut down all congressman's pay too . If the people who risk their lives don't get an increase in pay , why should we continue raising pay for those who take no risks and reap the benefits ? REPOST if you support troops 
Cant describe the feeling , but all i know is that my cheeks hurt from smiling ! <3

Can anyone tell me why it is so hard for people to pray , but easy to swear ? Why clubs are growing but churches are shrinking ? Why it is so hard to re-post a Christian status , but easy to post gossip ? Why we can worship a celebrity , but not Jesus ? Gonna ignore this ? Most of you won't re-post this . The Lord said , if you deny me in front of your friends , I will deny you in front of my Father . Repost if you believe 
After everything did for him and stuck by his side and tried to show him hes not alone and this is how he treats me ... UH NO !!! sorry but I'm not going through this phase again or believe these lies sorry but one thing to know ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS !!!

The only thing love ever gave us and left us with ... as a broken heart ... </3 
The past does not define who you are only shows where youve been but you are given today to decide where it will take you in your future ... you're the only one who can decide which direction to take next ... so instead of worrying about the \ but what ifs\ " and asking why ... and just live ... because if we live in fear ... we will die never knowing how far it could have taken us .. if we just kept trying ... "

I AM FINALLY DONE ! 
I return home tomorrow ... cant wait for tuesday ! 
Where are you and I'm so sorry\ 
I cannot sleep I cannot dream tonight\ 
I need somebody and always\ 
This sick strange darkness comes creeping on so haunting everytime\ 
And as I stared I counted the webs from all the spiders\ 
catching things and eating their insides\ 
Like indecision to call you\ 
And hear your voice of treason\ 
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight\ 
stop this pain tonight 
Seeing my family was nice and now im going to be home sweet home in a couple hours ... and then looking forward to seeing my friends at college on Tuesday ... =D 
Got my watercolor done so i dont have to worry bout that anymore ... still tired but if i sleep now ill wake up at 3:00 am so i guess i just need something to keep me up ... maybe the lasanga in the fridge will do the trick 
I love this song \Chasing Cars\ " Snow Patrol ... If I lay here ... If I just lay here ... Would you lie with me ... And just forget the world ... " 
I love candy ... suckers , lollipops , dum dums ... sour green apples my favorite ... I am in my happy place ^_^ 
i was hacked sorry !!!! 
what happens when the only person who used to make you smile is the one that always makes you cry ... 
It's hard to explain to someone who has no clue . It's a daily struggle feeling sick on the inside while you look fine on the outside . Chronic PAIN that is unseen . Please put this as your status for at least 1 hour if you or someone you know has an invisible illness ( Anxiety , Bipolar , Depression , Diabetes , Lupus , Fibromyalgia , Lymes , Crohn's , Diverticulitis , MS , Arthritis , Cancer , Heart Disease , Autism etc . ) Never judge what you don't understand !!! Re-Post if you know how this feels . 
I'm either getting really sick or worse ... 
u know somethins wrong when u've been coughin for 2 1/2 hours straight constantly & thats ur only way to breathe gargle warm salt water & get it all over u cause u almost choked try sallowin & gag try coughin up stuff and u almost get sick to ur stomach eat & every bite u have gets coughed up cause u cant swallow it correctly have to gasp for air cause u cant breathe through ur nose almost pass out when u try not to cough ... I hope this goes away .... i hope i can sleep tonight ... im kinda scared =( 
-_- ... T.T ... =( ... Dx ... ugh ... i feel awful 
some people can burn < PROPMALE > and cheese i on the other hand can burn ramen noodles ... microwavable ramen noodles ... * sighs and shakes head in pure shame *

If I drown tonight , bring me back to life\ 
Breathe your breath in me \

If you only knew 
I love this song ! My Only One-All Time Low !!! <3

MY PHONE WORKS HECK YESH !!!!!!!! 
my pandora radio station is makin me feel better ... well a lil ... still hurt ... =/ 
Don't try to fix me ... I'm not BROKEN ... 
Anger doesnt get you anywhere but broken friendships ... So I'm done fighting 
Imagination feeds the mind , Love heals a broken heart , Music calms the soul 
sometimes your worst fears turn into a living nightmare ... that you never can awake from ... 
in the words of my dad < PROPFIRST > Perry ... there can be no shadow without light ... =D 
Watching The Nightmare Before Christmas 
Gonna work on my still life while listening to Pandora ... after a lil short nap ... I'm tired ...

So stressed depressed and idk ... just wantin to smile again .. for real ... ={ 
Drug education day ... oh joy ... I hate those ... because some ppl just don't realize how much it hurts to know that some people no matter how much we want them to get help refuse and then slip away from us ... its like gettin reality in your face ... and you can't do anything about it 
I need to fight the urge to call it all quits .... how the heck did it get this bad ... 
Just got done with hangin with < PROPFIRST > for tonight and had an awesome time I have a fantabulistic study < PROPMALE > ! 
Finally done with my charcoal drawing and happy with the results

I'm falling apart , I'm barely breathing\ 
With a broken heart that's still beating 
Doesnt know what to think or do anymore ... tired of making myself look stupid ... i just so confused ... wish i knew but i guess im not meant to know ... its like bein on a freakin roller coaster ... AHHHHHH !!!!
