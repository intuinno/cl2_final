Theres no problem so complex that it cant be solved by killing everyone even remotely associated with it . 
Shut the hole , just shut the hole ! 
As I'm trying to make everyone else happy , I'm making myself miserable in the process ..

It’s too late to talk to you but it’s still too early to say goodbye . I just want you to know that wherever you are you’re still on my mind . It’s never easy to understand why memories hold our hands but people let go . 
Before you criticize someone , you should walk a mile in their shoes . \ 
That way when you criticize them , you're a mile away from them and you\ 
have their shoes . 
Its funny , my entire family is sick except me ; i guess being in my room by myself is a good thing + i dont have to deal with \Family Stuff\ " :D "

A definition of you :\ 
An individual who has an over-inflated sense of self worth , compounded by a low level of intellegence , behaving ridiculously in front of colleagues with no sense of how moronic he appears . 
As stated in my last status : You are a douche bag . 
So , i go to a fieldtrip ( that was actually very intersting and i learned alot ) , but all of a sudden i get light headed and start aching BAD . I feel like crap :(

No .

You know what i dont get ? You spend 2/3 of your entire life in school so that you MIGHT end up getting by .. And its even worse in the current economy of ours ..

And at those times when your engulfed in the darkness and loneliness of lifes deepest caves , remember , the way out is to keep moving forward and dont look back . 
These 5 fingers ... Individually their nothing . But when i curl them together like this into a single unit , they form a weapon that is terrible to behold . 
A whole new chapter in life . the bad , the good . and the horrible . right now ? horrible . what to do about it ? move forward and trash the things in the past . easy ? no . 
Time takes it all . Whether you want it or not , time takes it all away , time bares it away , into the darkness . Sometimes , we find others in that darkness , and sometimes we lose them there again . \ 
- < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > 
Had a dream within a dream . Hmm , Joooohn what were you doing there ?

Love is a fire . But whether it is going to warm your hearth or burn down your house , you can never tell . Careful now not to burn yourself with those flames . *_* 
So im home alone and my cat is on my bed staring at the corner of my room , she wont take her eyes off of \it\ " and even when i pick her up and move her head she just keeps staring at \ " it\ " .

It is said that the reason leaves fall off the branch is to allow new leaves to grow . \ 
No matter how sad the fallen leaves look , \ 
There will always be new sprouts to take their places . \ 
Perhaps the emptiness in the heart is something similar to that .. 
Depression on my left , Loneliness on my right . They don't need to show me their badges . I know these guys very well .

Quote of the Day : “You seen my cell phone ? \\ 
Lost your pen = no pen \ 
No pen = no notes \ 
No notes = no study \ 
No study = Fail \ 
Fail = no diploma \ 
No diploma = no work \ 
No work = no money \ 
No money = no food \ 
No food = skinny \ 
Skinny = ugly \ 
Ugly = no love \ 
No love = no marriage \ 
No marriage = no children \ 
No children = alone \ 
Alone = depression \ 
Depression = sickness \ 
Sickness = death \ 
Lesson : Don't lose your pen , you will die 
Ah crap , its that song -_- \ 
Im gonna go crazy again :( \ 
I need to talk to someone . Kayree !! 
so my uncle just brought home three live 50 . cal bullets to his rifle ... wth is he thinking .........

You know , you shouldn't jump around when this nice woman is holding a sharp pair of scissors . If you move she could slip and slice your jugular vein , on accident . There is no way to stitch the jugular . All of your blood will be on the floor in four minutes . I have seen this . I have done this . You don't want this . 
I feel like an old man -_- .. my back hurts like heck and I have to walk all hunched over :/

The place where optimism most flourishes is the lunatic asylum . 
I have to admit , you have guts . Too bad they're all over the floor .. 
All I remember is pure , unfiltered hatred . I was Ghenghis Khan . I was genocide . Stars collapsed under the weight of my fury , and when I opened my eyes all I saw was the heads of ten thousand on bloody pikes peppering the horizon from Los < PROPFEMALE > to New York City . 
Okay , Madea's Big Happy Family was funny as hell xD 
I guess I just prefer to see the dark side of things . The glass is always half empty . And cracked . And I just cut my lip on it . And chipped a tooth .. 
Remember the < PROPFEMALE > rule : Those that have the gold make the rules . 
Its quite ironic that in life , the person that brings out the best in you & makes you stronger can actually be your greatest weakness . 
Constipated ? Try a banana ! Not like that , silly !

Friendship isnt measured on the length youve known a person . But how strong the bond grew in that length of time . 
Mm .... :/

Wow , people get so caught up in summer that they forget that when school starts again things go back to normal ; think ahead before making a decision . oh well , things are gonna change again . \ 
\He who rejects change is the architect of decay . The only human institution which rejects progress is the cemetery . \ " \ 
When faced with two choices , simply toss a coin , \

You suddenly know what you truly want . 
I thought about how mothers feed their babies with < PROPFEMALE > little spoons and forks so I wondered what do Chinese mothers use ? Toothpicks ? 
Today I saw a sign on the door of a Sams Club that said “It is illegal to set off fireworks inside the building . ” I really wish I had been there on the day they decided it was necessary to post that .
