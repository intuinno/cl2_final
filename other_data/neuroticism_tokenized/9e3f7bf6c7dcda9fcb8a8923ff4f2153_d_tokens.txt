Be very careful if you make a woman cry , because God counts her tears and holds the one causing them accountable . The woman came out of a man's rib , not from his feet to be walked on , not from his head to be superior , but from his side to be equal , under the arm to be protected , & next to the heart to be loved . Copy and paste if you agree

I'm not coming back , i've done something so terrible ( forgive me ) . I'm terrified to speak , but you'd expect that from me . ( I'm not calling , I'm not calling ) . I'm mixed up . I'll be blunt . ( you're driving me crazy , im .. ) . Now the rain is just washing you out of my hair . 
And out of my mind , keeping an eye on the world . So many thousands of feet off the ground . I'm over you now , I'm at home in the clouds towering over your head . i guess ill go home now , i guess i'll go home now ... i guess ill go home ...

I believe that everything happens for a reason . People change so that you can learn to let go . Things go wrong so that you appreciate them when they're right . You believe lies so you eventually learn to trust no one but yourself , and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together . 
had a great night :) <3 
but to lay your hands on a taken man , is about as low as a girl can get . and i wish her well as she rots in hell and you can tell her i said so . cheater cheater where'd you meet that low down , uptown , slept with every guy around , pressed on eye lashed no good white trash ***\
