SUPERDOOPER EXCITED to go to the EXTREME CONFERENCE , and so ready to come back a TOTALY changed person ;] !!! 

Happy New Year :D I love you guys , God loves you guys now lets change lives this year ! <3 :D 
The best way to get back up is to get down on your knees ....... 
* SCREAMS*OMB , go eat some SNOW ;) !!!! 
Swirling shades of blue Slow dancing in your sky The sun kisses the earth And I hush my urge to cry ' Cause I hear the whispered words In your masterpiece beautiful You speak the unspeakable through I love you too I wanna be there for you And be someone you can come to I wanna be there for you And be someone you can come to The love runs deeper than my bones I wanna be there for you ~ Flyleaf 
\Friendship is Love without his wings . \ " < PROPMALE > " 
\I believe in the sun even when it's not shining . I believe in love even when i don't feel it . And I believe in GOD even when he is silent\ " <3 ~ Barlow Girl " 
Dance with God .... he'll let the perfect man cut in :) 
\Blossom your life as if you were a beautiful flower <3 \ " ~ Kala " 
You gota face the clouds to find the silver lining .... 
Fill my dark skies , make me see the light . Life is fine , soooooo bring the SUNSHINE :D Oh my lovely shining for me , let my eyes see all the BEAUTY <3 LET IN THE SUNSHINE :D 
Omg , jst went through 3 prom dresses :O lol final got one that well \covers\ " everywhere ;) lol Sooooooo happy :] lol " 
Baby loves to dance in the dark .... You'll never fall apart ! You're always in our hearts <3 Never let you fall apart ..... Together we'll dance in the DARK .... <3 
Been through the fire and the rain , bound every kind of way . But God has broken every chain , so let me go right now ! Take the shackles off my feet so i can dance . I just wanna praise you , just wanna praise you ! You broke the chains , now i can lift my hands ! And I'M GOING TO PRAISE YOU , JUST GOING TO PRAISE YOU <3 
She needs more than a hug on a holiday . She needs more than a smile on Sunday . She's not looking for you to fix whats wrong . She rly want to knw she belongs . She needs more than a love song <3 
Keep your feet on the ground when your head's in the clouds <3 
So what if it hurts me ? So what if I break down ? So what if this world throws me off the edge , my feet run out of ground ? I gota find my place , I wanna hear my sound . Don't care about all the pain in front of me . I just wanna be happy . Just going to be HAPPY <3 
You can love someone with all your heart , for all the right reasons and in a moment they can choose to walk away , love em anyway <3 God is great , but sometimes life is'nt great and when i pray it doesn't always turn out the way i think it should , but i do it anyway . You can pour your soul out singin a song you belive in , that tommorow they'll forget you ever sang , sing it anyway . I SING ... I DREAM ... I LOVE ... ANYWAY <3 
Release your inhibitions . Feel the rain on your skin , no one else can feel it for you . Only you can let it in . No one else can speak the words on your lips . Drench your self in words unspoken . Live your life with arms wide open . Today is where your book begins , the rest is still unwritten <3 
Love is a shelter in a ragging storm . Love is peace in the middle of a war . And if we try to leave , may God send angels to guard the door . No love is not a fight , but it's something worth fighting for ! Love will come and save us , if we only call . He will ask nothing from us , but demand we give our all . Cuz I will fight for you , will you fight for me .... <3 
When the rain comes you blame it on the things that you have done . When the storm fades , you know the rain has fallen on everyone . So rest a while , it will be alrite . No one loves you like I do . I can't stop the rain from falling down on you again . I can't stop the rain , but I will hold you till it goes away .... <3 
There could never be a more beautiful you . Don't buy the lies , disguises and hoops they make you jump through . You were made to fill a purpose that only you can do . <3 
I'm alive , I'm alive that's what I say ! I'm alive and I'm goin live today ! We were born with wings ! We were made to fly ! We were meant to live while we're still alive <3 <3 <3 
ROCK what you got , ROCK what you got ! DON'T EVER LET THEM MAKE YOU STOP ! ROCK what you got , Light up the lot . NO one can ROCK the way you ROCK ! This one's for the beatin dwn , who gave up on their rock n roll . Lift your eyes from what drags you dwn ! You were born to rock inside your SOUL ! <3 <3 <3 
It's like moving moutains ..... 
I am no one's fool and I will not a broken hearted girl ! God's got this upside down life in his hands n I'm not fight him anymore ! I'm jst letin it all go n throwin my hands in the air .... I DON'T CARE <3 <3 <3 
Life's a dance you learn as you go ..... <3 <3 <3 
God understands our prayers , even when we can't find the words to say them ... <3 
Bailamos ! < PROPFEMALE > noche ... BAILAMOS ! WOOOP WOOP Prom tommorow ;D Yeaha <3 
God's promises are like the stars ; the darker the night the brighter they SHINE <3 ~ < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > 
.... Makes me that much STRONGER ! Makes me work a little bit HARDER ! Makes me that much WISER ! So thax for making me a FIGHTER ! Make me learn a little bit FASTER ! Makes my skin a little bit THICKER ! Makes me that much SMATER ! SO THAX FOR MAKING ME A FIGHTER ! <3 <3 <3 
I wouldnt take back anything that I've gone through . Now I pray for strength for anything I'm gonna do . Wether it joy or pain , I'm still okay . I'm gonna be alrite cuz I'm not afraid . I'm not afraid , cuz I've become brave as the light of day straight into the cave to show me the way . That I might be saved , now I'm turning the < PROPFEMALE > . Thanks to the power of love , I can love because I am brave . Yes , I AM BRAVE <3 <3 <3 
Open up your eyes . Awake , arise . Love like a hand reaches down and pulls us up from the dirty ground . Now is the time to step from the dark into the light cuz you can't change what you've done . But you can choose who you'll become . <3 <3 <3 
You say let it go , you say let it go . You say life is waiting for the ones who lose control . You say you will be everything I need . You say if I lose my life it's then I'll find my soul . Mmmmm ...... I'm letting go ;} <3 
Fully alive , more than most . Ready to smile and love life . Fully alive and she knws how to believe in futures . Here she stands today , in her brilliant shining way . Stronger than her pain , in her brilliant shining way . Fully alive and she knws how to belive in Jesus . <3 
So close , no matter how far couldn't be much more from the heart . Forever trust in who we are and nothing else matters . Life is ours , we live it our way . Trust I seek and I find in you everday for us something new . Open mind for a diffrent view . Never cared for what they say , never cared for what they do , never cared for what they know . And I know , no nothing else matters ..... <3 
It was all about a man . It was all about a cross . It was all about the blood that was shed , so I would not be lost . It was all about the love that was bigger than a life . It was all about the freedom that was given through your sacrifice . Cuz you would rather die , then to ever live without me ...... <3 
Refined , I'll become the most dazzling precious treasure . I'll be treasured over all the earth . Bearing the gift of a new heart . < PROPFEMALE > ablaze I'm slowly burning ...... <3 
.... and if you asked me if I love him , I'd Lie <3 
I'm real , what you see is what you get ..... <3 
No matter what you say bout love , i keep coming back for more . Keep my hand in the fire , sooner or later I get what I'm askin for . No matter what you say bout life , I learn every time I bleed . I gotta let my spirit be free . I can't waste time so give it a moment , I reliaze nothing is broken . No need to worry bout everthing I've done , live ever sec like it was my last one . Don't look back got a new direction ... <3 
Things happen for a reason , you'll become a stronger person . When life tears you dwn then you'll understand it's never easy . But you'll knw when you get there , it builds you up :D WOOOOT here I come SENIOR YEAR n SUMMER :D better watch out ;) 
Can't wait to make it on a prayer to Commerce then to FL :D ;} ^_^ \ 
WOOOT WOOOT here we come Big SunShine State ..... \ 
The Conde Girls Causing PANIC <3 \ 
Lol ;p 
Life is not measured by the breaths we take , but by the moments that take our breath away <3 
Be strong in the Lord and never give up hope . God's got his hand on you so don't live life in fear . Forgive and forget , but don't forget why your here . Take your time and pray . Thank God for each day , his love will find a way <3 
When I opened up my eyes to day , felt the sun shining on my face . Got rid of fears holdin me dwn . I'm feeling so good cause nothing in this world can turn me round . Had an terrific nite ;) with someone very special <3 . So ready to change this world round tommorow , with my family n love backin me up :D WOOT WOOT HERE WE COME WORLD CHANGERS <3 <3 <3 
Trying to live an unhindered life <3

I love you , You love me , and God loves us ..... \

Don't tell me the sky is the limit , when there are footprints on the < PROPFEMALE > .... <3 
The real lover is a man who can thrill you by kissing your forhead or smilling into your eyes or jst staring into space .... <3 
We should all start to live while we're young , fear and regrets are stupid excuses not too LIVE LAUGH n LOVE your life <3 
Imperfection is beauty , madness is genius and it's better to be absolutely ridiculous than absolutely boring ... <3 
The most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched , they must be felt with the heart .... <3 
I miss skipping rocks with you :( <3 
This is your life dont let it pass you by ... <3 
Life is a dance floor . You get what you're given , it's all how you use it .... <3 
Wow has ALOT to think about .... 
Hmm LOVE dancin in the rain ... <3 
Thunder only happens when its rainning , players only love you when they're playin . When the rain washes you clean you will know <3 
I think I'm in love with my radio <3

Cuz i'm only as tall as my heart will let me be and i'm only as small as the world will make me seem . When the goin gets rough and i feel like i may fall , i'll look on the BRIGHTSIDE- i'm roughly six feet tall <3 
Like sunlight burning at midnight making my life so beautiful beautiful beautiful <3 
llamas a polvo De amantes a amigos , por que todas las cosas llegan a su fin ... <3 
Cuz a face without freckles is like a sky without the stars . Why waste a sec not loving who you are ? Those little imperfections make you beautiful , lovable , valuable they show your personalty inside your heart reflecting who you are .... <3 
The ppl who matter dnt mind and the ppl who dnt mind matter . So if you have a problem with me solve it . If you think im trippin , tie my shoe . If you cant stand me , sit back down . Cant face me , turn around . Jst take me as I am <3 
The pressure makes us stronger . The struggle makes us hunger . The hard lessons make the difference and the difference makes it worth it . Let it set your heart on fire , let it set you free ..... <3 
Life is a maze and Love is a riddle . Jst let it go and enjoy the show <3 
Awe , thank you God for giving me a best friend and bigg sissy all wrapped up in a gorgeous girl named < PROPFEMALE > <3 Idk what i would do wit out her <3

Loving God , Big sissy , life and my new hair cut ;) <3 
Words mean more than what is wrote down on paper , it takes a voice to bring those words to life and fill a deeper meaning ... <3 
Close your eyes pretty girl cause its easier when you brace yourself . Set your thoughts on world far where we only cry from joy <3 
My beautiful aunt has finally gone home to our gracious father God <3 jst keep my family in your prayers and thoughts . If you ever had the < PROPMALE > to meet my amazing free spirt joyful aunt < PROPFEMALE > you knw how truely blessed we were to have such a astonishing women apart of our family . 1 Thessalonians 4:17 <3 
Anyone can jst give up , it's the easiest thing in the world to do . But , to hold it together when everyone else would understand if you fell apart , that takes true strength and courage . <3 
There is no fear in love ; but PERFECT love eliminates all fears <3 
Im not giving up , tonite the walls are coming down . I am stronger than my fears , this is the mountain I must climb . If i can overcome step one , I can face the 99 .

What if they aren't stars ? But openings from heaven where the love from our lost loved ones shines down on us , to let us knw they're happy <3 
I think , the best things in the world are : big hugs , passionate kisses , the smell of rain , daydreaming , walking through a field of wild flowers , LAUGHING , smiles ( particularly from strangers ) soft cushy pillows , anything chocolate , and being loved <3 
Vury much happy :D had great time tonite :) 
Dance in the rain , kiss under the stars , and love with all your heart <3

How do you keep your feet on the ground , when you were born to fly <3 
Its time to take back all the pain . Its time to make a final gain . Its time to take care , instead of misuse . Its time to love , instead of abuse . Its time to dry away the tears . Its time to shed the unwanted fears . Its time we learn not to hide from our true selves , or the other side . <3
