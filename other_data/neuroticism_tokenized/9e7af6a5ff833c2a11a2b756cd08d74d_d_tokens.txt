We live in a world that assumes that the quality of a decision is directly related to the time and effort that went into making it . Our adaptive unconscious challenges that belief and argues that our snap judgments may in fact be accurate evaluations of a particular subject matter . 
It's gonna be a great day for a 5k !

Im SOOOO excited ... Almost game time - GO PaTrIoTs !!!!

Breaking news : the House will drop “forcible rape” language that could have excluded some rape victims from being able to seek federal help to pay for an abortion . TPM attributes the decision to “pressure from women’s groups , Democratic politicians and < PROPFIRST > Stewart . ”\

Patio garden is coming along nicely ... Bring on the tomatoes , peppers , strawberries and herbs !! :) 
Thanks to harassing calls from Red Cross , I discovered Im a true universal donor , O- Rh- , found in 4-8% of the population . With the guilt trip that my blood type is the only one that should be used for babies , pregnant women , and those with weak immune systems , she has successfully persuaded me to give blood often . How can you say no to that ? 
Dinner tonight : wonderful mahi accompanied by plastic ( Yep , i continue to strike out at restaurants ) . Then sadly came home to find my tomato plant committed suicide by falling off my deck . Oh what a night . Lol 
Bring it on Centennial ! 
Pumped my pool is now open ! All are welcome :)

Laugh when you can ..?. Apologize when you should ..?. And let go of what you can't change ... Love deeply and forgive quickly ... Take chances and give your everything ..?. Life is too short to be anything but happy ...? You have to take the good with the bad ...? Love what you have ... Always remember what you had ... Forgive and forget .?.. and always remember .. that life goes on ..?. Post if you agree ? Life is too short !

I was going to complain about how hot it is ... then I realized that at least : 1 ) It isn't 109 degrees ; 2 ) I'm not 5,700 < PROPMALE > from home ; 3 ) I'm not dressed in a full BDU uniform and helmet and carrying 70+ lbs . ; and 4 ) there is very little < PROPMALE > that anyone will shoot at me or that I might drive over a bomb n the road today ! Thanks to all who serve . Repost so they all know how thankful we are for our Freedom !

Goodbye paradise . 
The mechanics said to ride my baby hard ... That she likes it and it's what she's made for . Sounds like a ringing endorsement for speeding . Yes , I think I will . 
Great run and yummies at < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > to support Oakland Mills . Fall has the perfect weather to run in . 
Now THAT was a painful game to watch !!! 
Teachers ' hefty salaries are driving up taxes , and they only work 9 or 10 months a year . It's time we put things in perspective and pay them for what they do - babysit ! We can get that for less than < PROPFEMALE > imum wage . That's right . Let's give them $3.00 an hour and only the hours they worked ; not any of that silly planning time , or any time they spend before or after school . That would be $19.50 a day ( ........................ 7:45 to 3:00 PM with 45 < PROPFEMALE > . off for lunch and planning -- that equals 6 1/2 hours ) . Each parent should pay $19.50 a day for these teachers to baby-sit their children . Now how many students do they teach in a day ... maybe 30 ? So that's $19.50 x 30 = $585.00 a day . However , remember they only work 180 days a year . I am not going to pay them for any vacations . LET'S SEE .... That's $585 X 180 = $ 105,300 per year . What about those special education teachers and the ones with Master's degrees ? Well , we could pay them < PROPFEMALE > imum wage ( $7.75 ) , and just to be fair , round it off to $8.00 an hour . That would be $8 X 6 1/2 hours X 30 children X 180 days = $ 280,800 per year . Wait a < PROPFEMALE > ute ... The average teacher's salary ( nation wide ) is $ 50,000 . $ 50,000 /180 days = $277.77 /per day/30 students = $9.25 / 6.5 hours = $1.42 per hour per student -- a very inexpensive baby-sitter and they even EDUCATE your kids ! Make a teacher smile ; repost this to show appreciation for all educators 
Happy birthday , Dad ! 
Snow !!!! 
C'mon Pats ... Cover Miller already !!
