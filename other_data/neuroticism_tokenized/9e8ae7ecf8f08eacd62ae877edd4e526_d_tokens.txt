Two hours until the gunfire begins ! 

took a not-so-pleasant trip down memory < PROPFIRST > . This is why insomnia is bad . 
Cardinal men's BB playing that patented lock-down Dawkins D: Cal shoots 60.7% from floor on way to 92-66 victory . And somebody either teach Landry Fields to make free throws or make him run lines ! 
The fix is in . Clearly , we're in store for a Dallas-Pittsburgh Super Bowl , courtesy of the WWE , I mean NFL .

thanks everybody for all the great birthday wishes ! And it was topped off by a late-night showing of \Up \"!" 
finished reading < PROPMALE > Arellano's Orange County and laughed out loud at the reference to < PROPMALE > Wilkie ! Now I remember why growing up in La Mirada sucked ! 
woke up at 9:00 AM , expecting the men's final to be over . What a great match , incredible final set ! 
is settling into a Sunday afternoon . 
might have the H1 N1 ( no fooling ) . Test results are pending .

Lick it up , baby . LICK . IT . UP .

The Facebook jinx is in full effect ! < PROPFEMALE > is < PROPMALE > !

No one should die because they cannot afford health care , and no one should go broke because they get sick . If you agree , please repost as your status today .

In keeping with the themes of the evening , I'd like to say that chocolate pudding is really good . 
Porridge with bananas and blueberries ...

FIRE < PROPMALE > TEDFORD ! 
Saturday night's alright for fightin ' . 
Back from pizza , ready for the rest of the evening , and ready to celebrate a big < PROPMALE > win highlighted by another < PROPFIRST > Owusu return TD . 
Spaghetti and Moe-balls are good ... 
To all the haters ( that means you , < PROPFEMALE > , and you , < PROPMALE > Ward ): < PROPMALE > 24 , ucla 16 3-0 1st place in the Pac-10 !!! 
Whoo ! A fumble on a fair catch to end it ! Sacramento's own Syd'Quan Thompson adds the exclamation point to another Tedford masterpiece of coaching ! 
RAIDER NATION ! Raiders are TEARING IT UP in < PROPMALE > ! How did they get SO GOOD ? You have to LOVE the safety/return for a TD on the free kick combination ! 
Which former Los < PROPFEMALE > football team is having the more embarrassing game ? Right now , believe it or not , the Rams are worse than the Raiders ! 
Whoo ! Guess the Gerhart Train got derailed at Corvallis ! Jacquizz Rodgers already has a buck-fifty rushing . Still have a < PROPMALE > at six wins and bowl eligibility . 
Beer drinkers , I recommend New Belgium Brewing Company's Hoptober < PROPFEMALE > ale for all your seasonal drinking needs . 
Golf , football , bluebooks . One of these things just doesn't belong . 
RAIDERS !! 
The owlde speckled ' < PROPFEMALE > ...

Must purge anger before grading blue books ... want to be fair to students . 
Good news : the property tax < PROPMALE > arrived and it went way down . Bad news : the property tax < PROPMALE > arrived and it went WAY DOWN . 
Too much coffee is bad for the stomach and nerves . Why can't I ever remember that ?

The Beatles in Mono is here and I feel fine ...

Part 2 : Therefore , if you have the time and the willingness to help , I would like to start conversations about methodology , historiography , and pedagogy in Latin < PROPFEMALE > n history and studies . I am particularly interested in the fields of colonial Latin < PROPFEMALE > , Mexico , and contemporary Latin < PROPFEMALE > n politics . Thanks for your patient reading of this post . 
Long ranting and raving posts are fun !

I never thought that I'd say this , but the U.S. Naval Academy RULES ! Take that , Notre Dame ! Won't comment on < PROPMALE > JUST yet ... 
Oh , baby , it's final ! < PROPMALE > 51 , Oregon 42 ! 
I am thoroughly disgusted at the amount of racist invective that is already being launched at Representative < PROPFEMALE > Cao of Louisiana . Unfortunately , I cannot say that I am surprised . 
< PROPMALE > drops the DOUBLE NICKEL beatdown on USC ! 
I have grave doubts that completing the presidential evaluation form will result in any substantive changes or bring any satisfaction . 
Memo to < PROPMALE > Harbaugh : stop reading the < PROPMALE > Tedford playbook . When you have a Heisman-caliber tailback , the way to win the game is not , I repeat , NOT , to give him the ball only 20 times and expect your redshirt freshman QB to pass you to a victory . Every game that < PROPMALE > has lost this year has come when Luck has attempted 30 or more passes . Tonight : 30 attempts , 10 completions , 1 more loss . 
Looks like it's Group G as the early favorite of Group of Death : Brazil , North Korea , Cote d'Ivoire , and Portugal . The U.S. received a SUPER sweet draw with England , Algeria , and Slovenia in their group . 
just spent 8 hours doing something that should have taken 30 minutes ... 
just ran into what appeared to be a glee club or some kind of singing group at a local restaurant . They were not charming or winning in any way , shape , or form as portrayed on TV . In fact , they made me want to punch every one of them in their annoying , geeky faces . 
Florida lost , Southern California lost , Texas is losing ... a lot of good stuff happens when you're power napping . 
drank Mr. Pibb today for the first time in decades . Hmmm . Perhaps there was a reason why so much time had passed . 
Lousy fuckin ' UT ! More reason to hate fuckin ' Texas ! C'mon Bullshit CS voters , give < PROPMALE > Fuckface Brown a taste of his own medicine and move TCU or Boise or Cincinnati ahead of the Fuckhorns ! 
My little < PROPMALE > and I are sitting down to enjoy some profanity-laced tirades about sports . Some traditions can never start too early ... 
Gonna study the L-Man/D-Dog flame wars tomorrow in class !

apologizes in advance for the following post : I should have started LT in my fantasy football playoffs out of respect for the fact that he's carried me to many championships before this season , and probably would have done so again with his performance tonight . 
Every day will be Boxing Day . 
Benjie doesn't really care for the < PROPMALE > Band , but wants to know why they were featured for only 30 seconds on the Sun Bowl telecast when viewers were forced to endure what seemed like an ENDLESS performance by the OU bore , I mean band . 
made tourtière , for some reason . 
doesn't know who to hate more in today's Hate Bowl : the Cowboys , whom I've loathed for 3 decades , or < PROPFIRST > Favre , who has only recently earned my highest loathing . 
Fucking asshole < PROPMALE > Nantz . 
The more that I think about the implications of today's ruling by the Supreme Court , the angrier I get . How could some of the most intelligent people in the country ( < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > excepted ) be so blindly STUPID ??? 
Twenty-four hours later . Nope , still pissed off . Day 2 of life in the Plutocratic States of < PROPFEMALE > Brought to You by GoldWalMartexxoNews Corporation in Conjunction with Focus on the Heritage Majority and Judicial Activists of < PROPFEMALE > , and additional funding from the Federalist Society and the National Rifle Association . 
I haven't watched the Super Bowl in years , and this pathetic , slimy , cowardly , craven , pandering p.o.s. stunt that CBS is pulling by bending over for the Focus on the F ***** Family ad seals the deal for this year , too . 
The sun'll come out ... tomorrow ? 
Part 2 : She also said that I had failed to inform her explicitly about the reasons why she did so poorly the last time she took the class , claiming that she had been , and continues to be , an exemplary and hard-working student . Never once did she ever admit any potential fault or failing in her behavior or actions . It's all clearly my fault . So , what would Facebook do ? 
The Problem Student , Day 2 : I think that what upsets me the most about this situation is the student's belief that it is acceptable to respond to an expectation for reasonable behavior in the classroom and a somewhat respectful attitude with extreme disrespect and confrontation . 
< PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > , I didn't delete this yesterday because of your comment , but because I screwed up the wording : Turns out it's not just all Asians who look alike , all Asian RESTAURANTS look alike , too .

Not looking good for the Cal Bears ... 
is hoping for a repeat of the 1993 NCAA 2nd round game between Cal and Duke .

Ohio State fans/supporters , prepare to be disappointed/infuriated : the aboslutely WORST official in college basketball is working the game against < PROPFEMALE > Tech and will most certainly SCREW the Buckeyes . 
Benjie is happy about today's enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act , but is still eagerly awaiting the arrival of his Canadian citizenship certificate . 
Back home again in Indiana ! 
Benjie has a cold ... yet another in a long line of \firsts \"." 
will not watch tonight's basketball game . I'm guessing that it'll be as rigged as a North Korean election or an NBA playoff game . 
Anybody know anything about this Tiger Woods guy who's playing in the Masters ? 
The Koreans showed up to play today ! 
Hey published authors : have you ever assigned your own work ( published book or article ) to students as required reading for a class ? What about unpublished work ( say an article under review or a conference paper) ? I am NOT planning to do this , but I am curious about what people think/do about this situation . 
Me and the B-man , just sitting up and spitting up ... 
What a bunch of ASSHOLES !!! 
may have discovered the perfect lullaby : lots of swearing and angry denunciations of right-wing kooks . The B-man went out like a light ! 
is ready to KILL . Here's a \student\ " answer in a bluebook : \ " A . < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > was a politician in the early 20th century . He is significant because he is a choice for identification on this midterm . How does this affect ' history' ? Well I'll probaby fail this question for sure on my ' History ' midterm so therefore it is signifcant in that aspect . \""

The built-in iSight camera on my MacBook appears to have gone to tech heaven . It's quite possibly the first time in nearly a quarter-century of owning and using Macintosh equipment that a component has failed before I upgraded to a newer computer . 
Depression is not a sign of weakness . It is often a sign that a person has been trying to be strong for too long . Help is available . This is mental health week and 1 in 3 people will suffer at some point in their lives . Consider putting this as your status if you know someone who has or has had depression and leave it on your status for at least one hour ?

Hey FB people : remember the kid who sent me the snotty e-mail and wrote the jerk-ass response in his bluebook ? Read below for his latest escapade . 
It is currently raining . In the event of rain , commencement ceremonies will be relocated indoors . To date , no official announcement or contingency plan . Another ARC FAIL . 
1:00 PM . Rain likely to increase . Still no announcement . 
Better bring your umbrellas to commencement , because it is almost CERTAIN to pour rain . This is all-too-likely given the assertion by administrators that all will turn out well tonight . 
should not read or watch the news late at night . It only serves to angry up the blood , like eating fried foods . 
Two hours into the grade-a-thon , and KISS is the latest selection in the iTunes shuffle ... need a break . 
just watched a hockey game on TV from start to finish , first time in years ( even Olympics ) .

Today's dispatch from Main Street , U.S.A. : Had lunch at local Mexican fast food place . Saw old white guy wearing \Obamunist\ " shirt . He asked girl at register : \ " So where in Mexico are you from ? \ " Old dude left after refilling his soda without paying ( $0.75 refills ) . Guess what's mine is mine and what's yours is mine in his version of the free enterprise society . "

I can't believe that I'm actually watching Regis and < PROPFIRST > Live , but it is on location on < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Island this week . 
36 holes , 7.5 hours , lots of walking , and good times with good friends . 
I'm angry enough at these freaking Whitman commercials to consider actually voting for her so that she can sh ! t down the neck of the decapitated corpse of California while her supporters weep in dismay . 
It's official : I don't really know anything any more about movies . I just inadvertently watched a < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > double feature : Memento ( which I knew was his movie ) and The Prestige ( which I didn't ) . Now to see Inception in , say , five years via Netflix . 
Always never ground your club in the sand . Never . Always . 
Family morning with soundtrack by the Beatles , and eagerly awaiting the arrival of Niña !

Drinking beer and stamping my carbon footprints all over the place ...

Happy Dude , 742 Evergreen Terrace , Springfield . 
Go Big Blue ! 
Is this the beginning of the end of the < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > AND < PROPMALE > Neuheisel eras at UCLA ? And should they just crate up the Heisman Trophy and send it to < PROPFEMALE > Arbor right now ?

Don't settle for field goals , < PROPMALE > ! Go for six ! Drive a stake through the hearts of those leprechaun lovers ! 
Big wins for the Pac-10 on the road ! SUCK IT , UT and ND !

Question : is Cal REALLY this bad ? Is UCLA even worse ? 
I am clearly missing something . Bewigged souls wandering down J Street in midtown Sacramento , and it's not October 31 , Mardi Gras , or gay pride weekend . What gives ? 
Despite being outdoors , the awful stench of bad cologne is polluting the terrace at Starbucks . Seriously , dude , you REEK . 
Well , that was auspicious . Just turned on the game in time to see < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > go deep .

Ladies and gentlemen , for the first time anywhere , your world champion SAN < PROPFIRST > GIANTS ! 
I voted today because I do not want my son , or anyone else's child , to grow up in a world where homophobia , xenophobia , intolerance , extremism , and selfishness deny people the right to a dignified existence , security , and the basic services necessary for them to become full-fledged , respectable members of society . 
Twelve more days to Benjie's first birthday !!

What is wrong with students ? Last week -- ME ( after kicking student out of class for playing with iPod ): Why do you even have it out ? STUDENT : Because it's something to do ! FAIL #1 
I'm giving up on coverage . Students bitch about what they don't learn and they bitch about how there's too much to learn , all while failing to appreciate the need for developing critical thinking skills about historical events and sources . 
So , I guess it's all my fault that 11 of 32 students failed in one section of the U.S. survey , including the seven who didn't even bother to show for the final . 
Remember when a syllabus was simply a list of required readings and course topics ? The latest incarnations of my syllabi read like a prenuptial agreement . 
The boy's expression says it all . 
Let's all go down to the Regal Beagle . 
went OFF on a student who ignored me and walked out of class before the end of the lecture . We will see where this all goes .

Special post for < PROPFEMALE > McCleary and ARC folks : family picnic today at Gibbons Park in < PROPFEMALE > Carmichael , with food courtesy of El Pollo Feliz . If you're not adverse to eating chicken , then this is THE PLACE for you ! 
Jimi Hendrix , < PROPMALE > Young , and I did the ironing tonight . What did everyone else do this Sunday evening ? 
A student brought me a note that she said provided evidence of an excused absence . When I opened it , I found it a note that she wrote and signed herself that said , in essence , \I was absent because I was sick . Please excuse me . \ " File under \ " not really getting it . \""
