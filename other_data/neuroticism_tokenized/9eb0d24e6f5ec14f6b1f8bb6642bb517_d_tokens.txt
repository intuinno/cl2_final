the most awkward-est moments are when you're at the market and you know the person that's bagging for you ... but you don't talk to them 
there's 2 kinds of retail therapy ; one where people use shopping as a getaway , and two where people need professional help to stop shopping . i'm under the second category . 
I finally have internet on my phone and I'm so amazed haha 
I wanna punch myself in the ears every time I hear the word \frappe\ " at mcd's no matter how good it is . "
