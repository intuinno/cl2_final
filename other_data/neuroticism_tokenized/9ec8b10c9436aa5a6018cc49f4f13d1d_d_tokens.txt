I just watched this reality show about men and women .

F those who have the nerve to lie to you wether you know them or not . People should have the common courtesy of bein an adult , even if they just met you . this is for those people out ther who cant or dont know how to grow up . 
well as far as im concerned the idiots out ther talkin about me and seein my kids and runnin ther mouth can shut the f up . you dont know what ive been through and have had to deal with , with the court . and when someone says that they will bring your child around to see and then they dont , and instead asks if ya want to go and drink . seems to me the moms are to blame not me .
