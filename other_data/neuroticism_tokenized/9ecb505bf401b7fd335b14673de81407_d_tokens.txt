has returned home . Too many people texted me Happy New Year , so here's my ' Happy New Year ' to everyone . I missed you all . Homework amount that sucks ... 10 < PROPFEMALE > scrapbook , debate project , and PreCalc at the very least . Kill me now . 

is going to be hanging out with some of the coolest people you've ever ( or might never even met ) later today . 
had lots of fun digging up very old memories of Nankin Mills . And oh yes , my Field Day shirt from 2001 still fits !! Yes ! 
is in love with the boom of the thunder and the pounding of the rain .

just finished a family game night and is wondering what was actually said . 
Gosh darn it ! I have Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog in my head now . Thanks for that guys 
has a statement to make : Is the mop ever unhappy that it is constantly getting pushed around and doing the dirty work ? No , so why should anyone think I'm am ? 
People change to get what they want . Be smart enough not to be fooled but clever enough to know a good thing when you have it before you lose it . 
is still awake ... 
so we ( < PROPFEMALE > and I ) caught a mouse . I found a cage , hamster wheel , food dish and everything . < PROPFEMALE > ( the mouse ) was shaking so badly that we let her go . She jumps off my two story deck . FML . 
is reading some really kick ass < PROPMALE > Potter FanFic , made by her best friend no less ! Watch out world , here comes your next best-selling author . Love you babe ! 
I don't ask out of habit . I ask because I care . I ask because I want you to know that I'll always be there if you ever decide to need me . 
has magically lost her phone ... don't call/text since I won't answer ... check back for status updates to see the news of recovering it ... 
can't put her thoughts in words . 
SAILING ! 3 DAYS WITH SOME OF MY BESTIES ! ROLLER COASTERS ! AND MEMORIES THAT WILL LAST FOREVER !! 
says thanks for always being there when the rest of the world walked out , thanks for making the tears stop to only be replaced with a smile , thanks for believing in my dreams and aspiriations when we both knew that's all they'll ever be , thanks for showing me how to laugh again even through the pain , thanks for teaching me that no matter what anyone says you'd still be at my side , thanks for being my best friend . <3 
is doing some online window shopping . So far she's decided on stuff from Journey's , Hot Topic , and PacSun 
couldn't be more in love with her life right now . This has to be the happiest she's felt in a very long time . Nothing can slow me down , not even that funeral today dampered my spirits enough to make me want to change any part of it . 
is really excited for the first day of school all of the sudden . She's also really hoping that she likes her first hour Honors Debate since she really wants to bring crayons and coloring books for at least the first day of school , if not possible to do more often . I can't wait to be a < PROPMALE > ! 
realized that she is afraid of squirrels even though they're one of her favorite animals . Luckily she had her best friend there to protect her . And she's totally going to feed them again some time soon ! 
Quote : People say what they think others want to hear rather than what they need to . 
Quote : The only people who are given help are those strong enough to ask for it . 
Quote : Give only to others , what they're willing to give in return . 
is really , really excited for < PROPFEMALE>'s birthday tomorrow >=) < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > 
I love you more than you'd ever imagine . I deny every second that I care , in a failed attempt to prove to myself that I don't need anyone but myself . But even I know , I'm wrong . 
I'm going to laugh off all the worries . Even when my voice shakes and cracks , I'll still laugh . Because I'm going to be happy one way or another . 
believes that true friends talk without intention , give without reason , care without expectation , love without condition , and be there through thick and thin . 
is a ball of fucking sunshine . Don't ask , I don't feel like talking . 
has convinced herself she doesn't need love . 
To talk without thinking is to shoot without aiming 
\Ding < PROPFIRST > the Wicked Witch is dead . Which old Witch ? The Wicked Witch ! \ " - 70th Anniversary Edition of Wizard of Oz . Gosh I love weekends . " 
Late night , come home . Work sucks , I know . She left me roses by the stairs , surprises let me know she cares . Say it ain't so , I will not go . Turn the lights off , < PROPFEMALE > me home . 
Well her face is a map of the world , is a map of the world . You can see she's a beautiful girl , she's a beautiful girl . And everything around her is a silver pool of light . The people who surround her feel the benefit of it , it makes you calm . She holds you captivated in her palm . 
I don't care what you think ! As long as it's about me . The best of us can find happiness in misery . 
In life you have two choices : to change the world , or let the world change you . 
is writing . Nothing to share really but if I don't reply , that's why . 
ARG ! < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > Schwartz got Hollywood Undead stuck in my head . Too bad I love them anyway . 
is slipping . 
is beginning to catch up with the people who are so important in her life but never gets to see anymore . And I couldn't be happier with it . 
Everyone says they're alone in this world . Trying to reach out to that one person who would make the difference . Next time , take the open hand when offered to you instead . 
Why is no one up at 2am anymore ?! Happy Birthday Cosette Girardot ! And it's TWLOHA Day too ! 
There are times when I look back on life and think , \Where'd all of it go ? \ " And there are other times when I look ahead on life and think \ " How will I ever make it ? \ " But right now I'm looking at myself as I am and thinking \ " This is pretty good for once . \"" 
Feels kind of empty . But simply can't place what she's missing . 
is letting go of the past . Starting with all those stupid text messages of your's I saved . 
is grounded for talking on the phone instead of doing homework . Bye Bye phone and computer ! 
has come to the realization that she needs to take many more pictures . 
has total lack of motivation for anything right now . 
There are two kinds of secrets , the ones we kep from others , and those we hide from ourselves . 
I'm leaving on a jet plane . I don't know , when I'll be back again . 
Absolutely loved Wicked . With a passion ! If you think you've seen it , you've seen nothing unless it was on Broadway . I absolutely love Elphaba now ! 
Hands touch , eyes meet . Sudden silence , sudden heat . Hearts leap in a giddy whirl . He could be that boy . But I'm not that girl . Don't dream too far . Don't lose sight of who you are . Don't remember that rush of joy . He could be that boy . I'm not that girl . 
Why does no food taste good anymore ? 
Where I'm from , we believe all sorts of things that aren't true . We call it history . A man's called a traitor or liberator ; a < PROPMALE > man's a thief or philanthropist ; is one a crusader or ruthless invader ? It's all in which label , is able to persist . 
Why doesn't my puppy understand that the toy is mine ? 
Yay ! The puppy is finally tired after like 4 hours of playing ! 
My puppy must think she's Jesus , she's taken up washing my feet . Only , I don't think Jesus used his tongue ... 
is so glad she has Hollywood Undead to block everything out so she can focus on her huge amount of homework and projects . 
Yay for 1:30 am projects and homework ! 
I'm through accepting limits , ' cause someone says they're so . Some things I cannot change , but ' til I try , I'll never know ! Too long I've been afraid of losing love I guess I've lost . Well , if that's love , it comes at much too high a cost . I'd sooner buy defying gravity . Kiss me goodbye , I'm defying gravity . And you can't pull me down . 
doesn't know what's wrong . 
forgot how good Reeses taste until now . 
I just wish to make people happy . 
Play Practice . Then wrapping way too many presents . 
Going to go get blood drawn , doing more Christmas shopping , Nativity Play , and then wrapping more presents . UGH ! 
is cleaning her room , a slow and painful process indeed . 
Sherlock Holmes , definitely worth seeing . I liked it more than I think I would have liked Avatar or New < PROPFEMALE > . 
Ah ! Only like 2 hours left and no where close to being ready for the party ! Whatever , I'm excited . 
is sick . 
Ash's party soon . Then going snow mobiling tomorrow I think ^^ 
is going snow-mobiling for the next 3 days , I don't think I'll have internet or cell signal . Bye 2009 ! 
is finally done with all of her application . All 13 of them :3 Thank you Mommy !! And I've already been accepted to one of them . Good way to start 2011 . 
Goodnight < PROPFEMALE > . 
and looking back , I ask myself \when did it all change ? \"" 
is sick . Headaches suck . 
Happy is what happens when all your dreams come true . 
has way too much homework . So as much as she loves you all , she'd prefer if you only text if you need to talk . Otherwise , sorry but no time ! 
Lavender 
I don't what it is , but I just can't seem to get enough of your smile . 
BREAKAWAY ! 
I'm not a child now . I can take care of myself . I musn't let them down now . I mustn't let them see me cry . Cause I'm fine , I'm fine . 
Your arms are my castle . Your heart is my sky . They wipe away tears that I cry . The good and bad times , we've been through them all . You make me rise when I fall . 
I guess after a while you just believe to realize that you're worth more and deserve to be appreciated to your fullest . 
wishes she could stretch the time between 3 and 4 for a long time . Too much homework , not enough time ! 
Plastic takes over 400 years to break down . 
They honestly don't understand . And I can't blame them for it . I can however get more frustrated . 
Going to < PROPFEMALE>'s for the night . <3 
is in a wonderful mood . I just wish < PROPMALE > Brown was here and that < PROPFIRST > Saunders wasn't stressed over projects . PS < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > is my perfect woman ;) <3 <3 <3 
Friends are angels who lift our feet off the ground when our own wings have trouble remembering how to fly . 
Isn't it amazing how all the little things that used to bother us when we were younger fill our day with enjoyment now ? 
Kill me now . >_< This PES Review sucks . It will take me more hours than my Honors Debate Final did . That this is just a review ! 
Someone once told me that rather than holding it all in and thinking you'll cause more problems for somone else , you actually let them escape their own nightmare , at least for a moment . 
wishes that words didn't hurt as much as they do , since people say things without realizing their effect . 
I've let it in for more than 5 seconds . Time to move on . Back to homework . 
Disney music is amazing . <3 <3 <3 
It's a quarter after one , and I'm all alone . I said I wouldn't call , but I lost all control . And I need you now . I don't know how I could do without , I just need you now 
Going to work out . Text me if you need me . 
It's different when you're lonely , the whole world seems in love . 
Make a wish <3 
Still awake . 
Life is easy when you spend it with the ones you love . <3 
Got a new camera <3 Now hopefully < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > and Cosette Girardot won't have to take all my pictures . <3 
Hey Soul Sister , ain't that Mister Mister , on radio , stereo . The way you move ain't fair , you know . Hey Soul Sister , I don't wanna miss , a single thing you do , tonight . 
just finished a 6 mile run . God , that felt good . Shower , then bed . 
I laugh because sometimes it's easier to pretend to find it humorous then to admit it scares me . 
2 Finals Down . Did well enough on both of them to have A or A- in those classes . 
\i\ " before \ " e\ " except after \ " c\ " ... that's just weird . " 
11:11 <3 
For once , things seem to be going perfectly :) 
Going to dinner , packing , then going to Co's . <3 Loving life . 
It's funny how quickly your perspective can change . 
Why do I suddenly feel like I burned every bridge ? 
I can show you the world . Shining , shimmering , splendid . Tell me , < PROPFEMALE > , now when did you last let your heart decide ? I can open your eyes . Take you wonder by wonder . Over , sideways , and under on a magic carpet ride . 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvou2XxB5Cs 
I'm crazy . There's no doubt about it . 
ARG >_< My step father is an ass . Gosh , he eats all the stuff I make without even asking . They aren't even for me ! Those cupcakes and cookies were for my friend who just ( when she receives them ) just finished an ACT exam . 
Robots makes me feel so much better . =] 
Two dozen cookies : Check . Two dozen cupcakes : Check . 6 hours of Robotics : Check . 4 hours of Battle of the Bands with your best friends : Check . Having your best friend < PROPFEMALE > Lakatos spend the night : Check . Cramming it all in one weekend : Amazing . 
is in such a good mood . I love my friends <3 
Today kind of sucks . 
Today was better than expected ... thanks everyone . I'd feel bad not being able to tag everyone ( apparently you're only allowed to tag 6 people - lame ) . So thanks for a fun day of sledding all the same . 
I really need to just scream at the top of my lungs for a moment . Unfortunately , that isn't going to happen . 
Make these feelings go away . Please =( 
Happy \Tell her she's beautiful\ " Day . " 
Anyone else forget to go around and go and get the Robotics permission slips signed ? Whoops . 
Disney is my escape . 
had a wonderful time with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > these past 2 days . I love you baby . I hope you have a wonderful < PROPFIRST>'s Day . 
like photos , we develop from the negatives . 
leaves for Florida in a matter of moments . :) ???? 
is off to Magic Kingdom today ; here I come < PROPFIRST > ! 
Yay ! We're going to Epcot today , that means I get to see Figment ! :D 
thinks she might have eczema on her lower arms . Fantastic . 
Emotions mean absolutely nothing unless you have someone to share them with . 
but I don't want to be a cheerleader , I want to be a football player . 
is missing being home . Sorry if you're one of the people who I keep bugging about this . 
is going back outside to tan some more . 
has \From me to you\ " by the Beatles stuck in my head . " 
is so happy to be home =] 
I hate you since I can't seem to let go of all those little moments that made me love you even when you hurt me so . 
is so confused . But possibly in a good way ? 
is definitely in a much better mood . :) 
was asked if she was anorexic today . Fail . 
I've complained for so long how I've never felt anything enough to make me care . Truth is , every time you simply brush your hand against mine makes me care . I feel that , everytime . 
should be going to robots soon . 
just dropped her cheesecake on her bed D: 
loves her guy friends who tell her she's beautiful even when she feels like everything's all wrong and that life's just crap . Thank you . 
lost 3 pounds ^^ 
The government predicts that because of childhood obesity , the current generation of American kids could be the first in over 200 years to live shorter lives than their parents , by 5 years ! 
is listening to music on Pandora . Makes my life so much more relaxing . 
just got back from the mall . 3 pairs of new shoes . Now I can replace the ones with holes in them :) 
is feeling great . Who knew eating healthier and exercising could do that ? ;) 
You lift my feet off the ground , spin me around . You make me crazier , crazier . Feels like I'm falling and I , I'm lost in your eyes . You make me crazier , crazier , crazier . 
is going to go run . Text if you need me . 
got 4 < PROPMALE > in so far . Going back for more . 
finished running 10 < PROPMALE > !! Victory is mine ! 
Just to see you smile , I'd do anything that you wanted me to . When all is said and done , I'd never count the cost , it's worth all that's lost . Just to see you smile . 
Running . Text if needed . =] 
Good run - 6 < PROPMALE > worth . Now enjoying Pop Tarts . So delicious . 
is off to dinner . Everyone happy ? Lol . 
is sooooo tired . Fail for having 3 more subjects . Probably BS-ing Chinese and Chem , and skipping PreCalc . 
did Chinese , doing PreCalc in the morning and Chem probably at lunch . Fun Fun Fun . 
really wants to go running . But knows that she'll not have enough time to go running , shower , and get to bed at a reasonable enough time to wake up and be at robots by 6am . F . 
Must be so lucky , her friends make her smile so much . I love you guys . Thanks for being a part of my life . 
Why is a < PROPFEMALE > like a writing desk ? 
is baking . I'm in such a need of a stress reliever . Resist the bad , taste the good . 
Good mood , great mood , bad mood , I'm-going-to-make-this-happen mood . I'm all over the place . 
< PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland was great - almost as good as the first time ;] Finishing up some stuff for robotics . Sorry if I was grumpy at Skyline , I love you guys <3 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > . I just realized how many times I've almost accidently typed that while thinking it was the \Search\ " box rather than the \ " What are you thinking ? \ " box . Oopsies . I love my sissy ! <3 " 
is in such an amazing mood right now . Good luck < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > Schendel , and < PROPFIRST > Saunders at Chairman's tomorrow . You'll do amazing . 
is off to dinner . And smile people , I love you too much to not see you happy . 
* sigh * 
Best friends are the people who pressure you to < PROPFEMALE > out and when you still say no , show up unannounced anyway ;] 
has way too much homework . Going crazy . I hate that my teacher's gave me so much freaking work ( in addition to giving me a more difficult role ) when they knew I was going to be gone . 
is going insane =( 
Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do , nothing to lose . And it's you and me and all of the people and I don't know why , I can't keep my eyes off of you . 
smiles when her friends actually believe her when she tells them how beautiful and gorgeous and amazing they are . <33 
You may need me there , to < PROPFEMALE > all your weight . But you're no burden I assure . You tide me over , with a warmth I'll not forget . But I can only give you love . Fall on me . Tell me everything you want me to be . Forever with you , forever in me . Ever the same . 
got maybe an hour of sleep last night . Too bad she tossed and turned all night so her homework isn't even done . T_T 
is in a \You know what ? I'm better than this kind of crap\ " mood and wants to go running today ! Probably will go running to clear my head . :D " 
All things appear and disappear because of concurrence and condition . Nothing ever exsists entirely alone ; everything is in relation to everything else . 
is excited to see < PROPFIRST > today ^^ Just have to go get ready so I can actually leave . 
I'm a quiet ticking time bomb . Just wait until I finally explode . 
Forget the little things in life , looking back you won't remember the insignificant things that people did . But holding on to them will only make you a bitter person . 
really wants to do something . Hmm ... maybe something arts and crafts related ? 
Finger painting ^^ 
is going to go work out . Yay for exercising :) 
is watching Life on Discovery Channel . It's amazing . 
wishes she could get outside with some friends to take some amazing shots . 
is so happy right now :] 
doesn't have very much homework . Maybe she can grab a camera and go for a walk ? 
* sigh * =( I hate suddenly feeling bad when nothing happened that should make you feel that way but still do . 
walked to McClumpha Park and all I can say is that it sure did help to clear my head . 
Talking to < PROPFIRST > for almost 3 hours makes my day better :) Such a happy mood once again . 
just realized how epically Facebook fails . The lastest friend suggestion has 2 friends in common with me . I have 532 friends for goodness sake ! 
I was running in circles . I hurt myself , just to find my purpose . Everything was so worthless , I didn't deserve this . But to me you were perfect . 
Everyone seems in a down mood , so rather than talk to people , I think I'll go watch Moulin Rouge on my laptop and do some homework . Ni Night Everyone 
totally bombed my Chinese test . oH well . One more day until Friday !! 
is going to bed before 10:30 even and has been napping since about 4:30 ... I really don't want to be sick right now . 
Just feels like \Blahhhh .... \ " and not quite sure what to think . " 
oKay so things were wrong in more than one way . Now I feel like crawling up in a hole until < PROPFEMALE > arrives . 
is going away for the weekend with her bestest < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > Lakatos ; this is about to be amazing !! 
loves her puppy to death but she's an idiot , she runs up the stairs and looks down out the balcony and starts crying that she can't get to us since she's too stupid to go back down the stairs . She's done this six times already this morning ! 
had such a fun day today . Went shopping with < PROPFEMALE > for her birthday . So much fun . A million and one stores hit and arms full of new clothes , shoes , and awesome tights . Making shirts now :) 
Sanity is such a bad thing to misplace . 
doesn't feel well . =( 
read on PostSecret today that \March is the month with the highest rate of suicides . \"" 
And the truths that we all try to hide , are so much clearer when it's not our lives . 
stuffy nose but other than that I feel really good . And not just physically either =] 
has been awake since 2am because she isn't feeling well . Mother said I have to go to school if I wanted to go to States . So off to school I go . 
doesn't understand what everyone meant when they said that getting your cartilage pierced hurts . I've been playing with it and sleeping on it and still no pain . I guess I'm just lucky like that :) 
is feeling much better . Off to have my protein bar for dinner and do math homework . Making brownies if I have the time . =] 
made brownies . <3 
\Life can't just be crayons and shit anymore\ " ~ < PROPFEMALE > Jagadics <3 " 
Dear Underapreciated , Lately you have been ignored , put second and worst of all not loved . How rude ! You are special and unique in every way possible . You come first in the eyes of many but come last in the eyes of those you want to come first in . Life has it's difficulties and the people whom stand by you are the ones whom matter the most . 
had a great time out with some of the mentors after States . Thanks to everyone else . Happy Easter :) 
feels like Easter is one of those holidays you really shouldn't get stuff . Somehow she ended up with $65 , 5 things of Play Doh , amazing coconut infused socks , and a bag of yummy < PROPFEMALE > . 
realized crying really isn't her thing . 
is looking forward to the promise of tomorrow . 
had a nice night and good day with < PROPFIRST > Saunders =] 
Arg , my parents decided they're going to Australia and leaving me behind , over the summer no less . I hate them so much right now . >_< 
has been looking at international engineering universities . Wow , I've pumped for college now . University of < PROPFIRST > , University of < PROPFIRST > Kong , University College London , University of Edinburgh just to name a few . 
Arg , my neck's still sore . 
is thinking that anyone who wants to go to Carvel for ice cream to support the Thespians could go around 8 to 8:30 . I think that's probably the time closest to when I'll be there . 
Does time actually make things better ? 
is so sleepy . Probably going to take a nap then off to dinner at the Melting Pot ? 
Hate is not the opposite of love . Indifference is . With hate , you still care about a person . 
is waking up with a smile on her face . :) 
I'd give you the world if I could but you don't want it . So I'll just tell you that I love you to the < PROPFEMALE > and back . 
One of my favorite things is when boyfriends agree to share their girlfriends with her best friends rather than just stealing her from all her other friends . <3 
really wants to get outside . oFF to find some running shoes and what not . 
3 hours worth of bike riding , playing at the park , and talking all with Davey Nikolits , day well spent :] 
really wishes she had someone to lay in the grass with her . 
can't help but smile when she talks with you . 
Yeah I don't really know what to say here today . 
needs help with English . It's my worst subject and the ACT just proved that to me once again . 
oKay since ACT statuses are boring - I'm updating it to say < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > tied a balloon to my wrist . :P 
It's 4:11 am and I'm awake . What's wrong with this picture ? 
Today , my voice will not be heard . With my deliberate silence , I < PROPFEMALE > those of the LGBT community who are forced to remain without a voice due to anti-LGBT bullying , name-calling , and harassment . Ending the silence is just the first step toward building awareness and beginning to address these injustices . Day of Silence . 
Text me if you need me . I'll be out at my dad's for the weekend . 
Happy 1 Month < PROPFIRST > Wickens =] 
had the puppy sleep in her bed with her all night . Tilly's quite the snuggler . 
is off in her own world , drawing ... too bad I'll never show anyone the picture . It could have been quite good . 
is in such an amazing mood right now . Super excited for tomorrow . Muahahahahaha < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > - you will never be able to evade me ;) 
is in love with her prom dress :] It's so pretty . Yay for at least having some part of me look pretty . 
is excited that she actually figured out how to send pictures from her phone to facebook , missing < PROPFIRST > Saunders , excited to see < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > tomorrow , and can't wait for Prom with < PROPFIRST > Wickens . 
would like to thank Mr. < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > and Ms. < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > for their humerous and thoughtful comments . They quite made my day today , especially after a rather distasteful 6th hour class . 
really wants to watch No Reservations now . oKay someone needs to decide when they're coming over to watch this Chick Flick with me . :P 
just found out that there won't be school on her birthday . Perfect way to avoid people =] 
cause even when I dream of you , the sweetest dream will never do , I'd still miss you babe . <3 
Interesting mood to say the least . oH well . Baking everything she can find in her house even if it's from scratch . So far 2 things of brownies are in the oven , 2 cookie recipes are printed , and a box of cake mix is sitting on the counter . Can you say stress relief ? 
Hey Mr. Grump Gills . You know what you gotta do when life gets you down ? Just keep smiling , just keep smiling , just keep smiling , smiling , smiling . What do we do ? We smile , smile , smile . 
wants to go see the new Disney movie , Oceans , that was released today in honor of Earth Day . Happy Earth Day ! 
wants a Waste Allocation Load Lifter - Earth Class 
loves the people who can stay friends even if they live < PROPMALE > away , went to college , or even changed school districts . Thanks to all my college friends , my boyfriend , and my close friend < PROPFEMALE > who has managed to love me even though we'd moved so many freaking times <3 
is really happy for no clear cut reason :) 
had an epic night with Davey Nikolits and making it look like the cheerleaders did it , definitely my favorite part :] 
is a Froot Loop in a world of Cherrios 
? And the worst part is , before it gets any better , we're headed for a < PROPMALE > . And in the free fall , I will realize , I'm better off when I hit the bottom . ? 
is quite possibly going insane right now . Then again , how does one tell if they are insane ? Isn't insanity the mere thought that you are sane when you are not in fact ? 
Why do my friends all have to be so amazing ? It makes finding time to < PROPFEMALE > out with all of them , while still getting sleep and attempting to keep grades up , slightly difficult . 
is off to go be a cat and take a nap in a patch of sun on the floor . 
feels bad that grieving no longer comes naturally to her . 
has come to the realization that she has enough bruises all over her body to look as though she was physically abused . Oopsie daisies . 
is exhausted still . This should make for an interesting day . 
hearing your breathing is enough to remind me that it's worth it . 
has come to the conclusion that attitude is everything . Walking alone , in the rain , and having to wait 2.5 hours for a meeting sounds bad . Until you realize that you walked along all the shops you never noticed and that you got to jump in the puddles while it was raining , or that you got to go to Panera and buy a tasty bagel that a friend suggested to peacefully enjoy two or so hours with a good book in the library . 
Arg , no idea what to wear to the Glow Out >_< So tempted to wear my neon green zebra striped bikini underneath ;] Possibly heading over to Cosette Girardot's ? 
Glow Out was fun for the most part =] 
is having fun with < PROPFEMALE > reading PostSecret and possibly going to the Green Fair <3 
is celebrating the anniversary of the day Voldemort died :) 
cut my bangs and oH gosh , scary thought ahead , you can actually see my eyes :O Looks decent for me doing it myself too . 
This is the story of a girl , her pretty face she hid from the world . And while she looks so sad and lonely there , I absolutely love her . This is the story of a girl , who cried a river and drown the whole world . And while she looks so sad in photographs , I absolutely love her when she smiles . 
As I lied my head in to the bushy grass \ 
and look up into the heavenly stars \ 
I realized , I fell in love with the moon . \ 
Her curving figure making her all the more perfect , \ 
her bright smile surrounded by a dazzling face , \ 
even her ever changing presence in my life . \ 
I lie , defeated , \ 
in the still of the night . \ 
I smile to myself , \ 
even if she is not my own , \ 
I will always have her to admire . 
is glad to be finished with her < PROPMALE > Final , though she must admit it does the model no justice . oN to another drawing :) I'm so happy 
What we need most in life is someone who tell us what we could do and tells us what we're capable of . 
Yay for cute pictures :D 
I hate having emotions . They make me hurt even when I can't do that much myself , currently feeling terrible and wanting to cry . Don't ask , I don't even know why myself . Just hug , that's all I need at the moment . 
Love can sometimes be magic . But magic can sometimes be ... just be an illusion . 
\Fun\ " Days put me in a better mood . " 
I love my < PROPFIRST > Saunders so var var much . 
loves the friends that sit on the phone with her talking about absolutely nothing . <3 
really wants to curl up and take a nap but I need someone to curl up with me since for some reason my body insists that it isn't safe here without you . 
It's scary how well my dad and < PROPFEMALE > know me . 
really wants to go take a nap . zZzZzZz 
I love my wifey , < PROPFIRST > Saunders , to Pluto and back :) She makes me smile even through the toughest times <3 
It's 4:03 and I can't sleep without you next to me , I toss and turn like the sea . 
thinks jamming out to music and having a dance party while Skyping is an epic win . 
I told you not to put me on a pedestal , now don't complain that I was right . 
Arg , too many people on my mind right now . Get off before you squish what little is left of it ! D: 
Not all who wander are lost . 
My day just keeps getting better and better :) Lovely thunder storm <3 Pretty funny day at lunch :) Went over to < PROPFIRST > Saunders and < PROPFEMALE > Saunders and made the Relay banner and now go to < PROPFIRST>'s for dinner <3 <3 <3 These are the days I love being alive . 
really excited for today . :P Then < PROPFEMALE > Lakatos is coming over to spend the night ^__^ and then we're making the Relay cake . Then Relay For Life of Canton , Michigan . W00t w00t . 
found out today that there is a Chinese version of facebook called RenRen since apparently facebook can spread too many messages that the Chinese government can't control so they banned it there . 
just finished making her Red < PROPFEMALE > cake :3 Yummy 
finished with $350 for Relay :3 Thank you everyone who helped me make this much of a difference ! 
Happy Birthdays to my two < PROPFEMALE > s even if they may be a world apart . Happy 17th Birthday < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > in Austriala , and Happy 16th Birthday to my very own < PROPFEMALE > Saunders back home . 
breaking someone's heart is easier to do when you're not trying . 
Me : \This cat is like me in cat form ! \ " \ 
Thank you everyone for the birthday wishes :) 
What is everyone doing for the Non-Protest Day ? 
He wears his heart safety pinned to his backpack . 
is excited to have her idea for Happy Non-Protest Day finalized . Just gotta print out a few tags and then is set . 
Darn it for being so ticklish 
Rawr , the clothes are taking over ! Why do I even have this much ? 
Goodnight stars , goodnight air , goodnight noises everywhere . 
Some days I look at you and simply forget to breathe . 
I love my friends so much . They're completely crazy but that's why I love them so much . 
is about to rock out Towel Day tomorrow with her lovely sister , Ms. < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > . 
I'm sorry , I might just have to kill someone if my moods keep insisting on being this rollercoaster . 
out of everything I could be : a girlfriend , a tutor , a team member , a dreamer , an inspiration ; I hope a best friend is your favorite . I hope I can always be someone who you just have fun with , someone you can tell your secrets to without fear of being judged , someone you can run to when you're scare , someone whose shoulders you can rely on , someone's back you can depend on to lift you up when you're down . 
Violence isn't the answer to all your problems , it is however the answer to most of them ;) 
Dear Sleep , \ 
\ 
I love you so dearly . Thank you so much for being there when I needed you most . \ 
With love , Me . 
Being invisible isn't a super power , it's a feeling . 
5 out of like 12 done . 
is going to the beach . Hellz to the yeah :3 
Tomorrow will come whether you are prepared or not . It does not slow its progress whether or not you're a part of you . You may as well embrace it and go into it with your head held high . 
Wow , really body ? You're going to do this again ? Woke up at 3:48 am after going to bed around 12:30 . > w < 
Playing in the sprinkler + smoothies + listening to < PROPMALE > Burnham + having friends smile at her = One of the happiest days ever . 
Bad Day , lost my iPod =( 
A wise girl : kisses but doesn't love , listens but doesn't believe , and leaves before she is left . I guess you can call me pretty stupid then . 
I'll be your angel giving up her wings if that's what you need . 
I can conquer the world single-handedly . So long as you're holding the other . 
* cough cough * I'm dying . 
has no motivation for her PreCalc final tomorrow . Thank you lack of attention span . 
Please don't be sad , I've already fallen in love with your smile . I'm not sure what I'd do if I couldn't see it again . 
is listening to the Beatles > (^w^) < 
Love is watching someone die . 
Envy is a green-eyed monster . 
misses < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . 
11:11 , now only if I could figure out what to wish for ... 
So yeah , that wish I didn't know what to do with earlier ? Yeah , I wish I didn't step on my < PROPFEMALE > headband and cut open my foot . Too much blood D: 
\My best friend is someone who gives me a book that I've yet to read\ " ~ < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > " 
The silence isn't so bad , till I look at my hands and feel sad , cause the spaces between my fingers are right where your's fit perfectly . 
is very tempted to wear Chip and < PROPFIRST > pajama pants tomorrow for the last day of school ... Decisions , decisions . 
has two of the most amazing people ever in her basement , < PROPFIRST > Saunders and < PROPFEMALE > Eshelman <3 
Life is simply amazing . Every part about it . The people that I can spend days on end with and still be amazing . Ended the year with decent enough grades to please my parents . And I think I've decided where to go on my trip :D 
is definitely making muffins in the morning . ^w^ 
is awake already ... off to make muffins and turn on my phone to text Ash =] 
* sigh * I guess I make everything worse ... =( 
had one of the best creations ever made today - Funnel Fries ! Funnel cake with elephant ear taste in the shape of a fry , topped with powdered sugar . 
I cried , never gonna hold the hand of another guy . Too young for him , they told her . Waiting for love of a traveling soldier . Our love will never end , waiting for the soldier to come back again . Never more to be alone , when the letters said the soldier's coming home . - ARG ! I can't get this song out of my head . 
It's the moment that you miss someone before they even leave that you know they're important beyond belief . 
Everyone needs friends , the kind that push but don't shove . 
is off to go paint soon . 
leads one busy life . And finally , it makes me very happy with exactly who's a part of it . Yard Sale shopping ? Quite possibly . 
needs sleep . It makes everything seem better . Nighty Night 
We are not the same persons this year as last ; nor are those we love . It is a happy chace if we , changing , continue to love a changed person . 
really doesn't feel like sleeping in her bed tonight , something about it just feels wrong . 
just kind of hurts all over . Maybe the couch wasn't the best of all ideas ... 
Look at me , look at me , just called to say it's good to alive in such a small world , all curled up with a book to read . 
will not clean her room , specifically since her dearest mother is canceling her plans to go out tonight since she didn't clean . So she refuses to do anything she asks :D 
is cleaning her room late at night . The most interesting things so far ? Old pictures from when I was 6 or so , 6 Adambot duckies so far ;) and some money from all over the world including a real Indian head nickel and a coin from the Republic of Macedonia o.o 
is giving up cleaning for this early morning . It's 3am . I should probably get some sleep . 
Self Goal : have room clean by Friday so my mother can never bitch at me again about cleaning it . 6 , almost 7 , garbage bags so far . And now I'm determined , you can see the floor ! 
Yep , life sure does keep me busy now . It helps , it definitely helps . 
Every second is another lost , one you will never get back . You can't lengthen or shorten them , you can only choose how to spend them . 
is off to be avoidant in the basement . Yes , I learned from the few psych kids in my classes last year the difference between avoidant and anti-social . 
>.< Really badly sunburned even though I had one sunblock . Whoops . On the plus side , now I have a unicorn animal band tattooed on my waist . =] 
I love < PROPFEMALE > the Pooh , but I just realized all the characters seem to have disorders . \ 
Winne the Pooh - Eating Disorder\ 
Tigger - Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder\ 
Eeyore - Depression\ 
Piglet - Anxiety Disorder\ 
Rabbit - Obsessive Compulsive Disorder \ 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > - Schizophrenia 
dear best friend , \ 
i love you more daily . i wish you could see yourself the way i see you and i wish you could love yourself the way i love you . and above all , i wish your life is everything you deserve because , in my opinion , you deserve the world . i will stand by you forever . my heart will always belong to you . 
Today is the tomorrow we worried about yesterday 
So I decided for college I'm going to have drawings of all of my friends all over my walls . If you're oKay with me drawing a picture of you , please \like\ " this status . " 
Anyone else notice that the Facebook homepage that normally says join now it's free , also says \(and always will be)\ " ? Win . " 
God , it feels so good to go running again . 7 < PROPMALE > and 618 calories worth makes for a very happy < PROPFEMALE > , not to mention seeing the lovely < PROPFIRST > <3 
so ... what just happen !? 
Check yes < PROPFEMALE > , here's the countdown . 3 , 2 , 1 , now fall in my arms now . They can change the locks , don't let them change your mind . Lace up your shoes , aye oh aye oh . Here's how we do . Run baby run , don't ever look back . They'll tear us apart if you give them the < PROPMALE > . Run baby run . 
Happy Birthday to my beautiful cousin , < PROPFEMALE > Wojcik and my bestie , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > =] 
iF I learned one thing this entire past weekend , Red Necks do not mess around about their bacon . 
I'm quite tried , but 27 dresses is on until 2am . Stay up and watch it ? I think it's a very strong possibility . 
I hate waking up since you're crying so hard . 
\Every atom in your body came from a < PROPFEMALE > that exploded . You are\ 
The nightmares are getting worse . 
So the nightmares have gotten worse still . No longer sad but now frightening . +1 for me . 
Busy , busy , busy . Nightmares are still bad but I have too much today to let that stop me . Going to DTP for the Market and taking my dogs to the vet , going to 12 Oaks to get my hair cut , < PROPFEMALE > Arbor < PROPMALE > Fair with < PROPMALE > , and IKEA with Ash ? Makes for one busy day . 
Walking in the rain for several < PROPMALE > is one of my favorite things to do on a Saturday morning in Downtown Plymouth . 
And so the nightmares continue . 
I think I'll go to bed early tonight . I miss Ash even though I just saw her like 3 or 4 hours ago , this is going to make for one difficult school year with her away at college . D: 
Make the nightmares go away . 
I hate how the smallest things upset me . 
My friends truly make the world a brighter place . 
found out today that Carnegie Mellon's school colour is plaid . For the win . 
Some days just aren't worth getting out of bed . 
Passed her Road Test ! :) 
Not only did I see my dear chickadee , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Larsen , at Secretary of State but I also should receive my license in a week or two . And I already drove out to see my < PROPFIRST > Saunders at her house with my temporary license . 
The mind sure does play tricks on one at two in the morning . 
I think I'm going to go hunt for something to bake ... wish me luck . 
Summer is great , and I love hanging out with my friends . But I miss school like crazy as weird as that sounds . I can't wait to meet new people , make new friends , become a new me . 
Always remember , every part of you is beautiful , just not everyone will have the wisdom to realize that . 
Summer 2O1O , I loved you but I think we've just grown apart . You've given me that warm feeling but lately something else has caught my eye . Shiny school supplies , a pretty parking pass , and an exciting , new school year lurk on the horizon . I'm sorry but I'm leaving you for becoming a Senior . Best of wishes , I hope you keep fond memories of me :3 
OW ! >.< Paintball hurts ! Wait till you guys see the one that cut open my legs ... it's black ! :D 
My family can be pretty awesome at times . After my surgery , my aunt got me a get well gift . Flowers ? No . < PROPFEMALE > Fly Trap ? Hellz yeah ! 
So I figured I should probably mention this at some point or another . I'll be gone for the next two weeks . I'll be seeing Ireland , Scotland , England , and < PROPFEMALE > . See everyone at school . 
is home . And to be completely honest , seeing everyone's smiles and warm hugs was simply amazing ; I can't even begin to describe it . Thank you everyone :) 
Muffins and AP Calc with < PROPMALE > Arquette and < PROPMALE > Brown ? What could possibly go wrong ? 
A HUGE thank you goes to < PROPMALE > ykins and < PROPMALE > for helping me finish my entire AP Calc packet in a couple hours . oH and thanks to the wonderful Davey for coming with me and < PROPMALE > to be \terrible teenagers\ " . Hellz yeah to starting Senior year with colouring books . " 
I'm happy . Really , I am . But a part of me aches when I think about how much you're enjoying life while I'm not there to be a part of it . 
I'm so excited for this school year . I actually have classes with people I like in fact . (: 
stole < PROPFIRST > Saunders . Shhhh , don't tell . 
I might have to kill the next person who tries to do my make up again . 
is working at Fall Fest like all day long and has to be down there in like 15 minutes . Hmm I should probably get moving especially since Ash is still in bed . oH and by the way , she's a space invader in bed and steals all the covers too . 
Several dozen homework questions for AP Calc ? Check . A few dozen reading packets for Honours Humanities ? Check . And a couple of research papers and such due Monday ? Check . Already having senioritis ? Shit I'm screwed . 
Today I was in the pits by myself , curled up in a tight ball with my head resting on my knees . Two separate groups of people ( from well known teams ) came up to me and asked if I was oKay . Robots , I thank you wholeheartedly . You've helped to restore my faith in people , some people really do care . 
Today I found out that I'm old enough to apply at Hot Topic for a job . When I asked my mother about applying for it , she said she didn't think I have enough time for a job due to having to keep my grades up , applying for colleges , student council , and robotics . When I told my dad about it , his main concern was that I would become more Goth . Yes , there is a reason I love my dad so much . <3 
To anyone in Humanities : Our homework where we had to read parts of the Epic of Gilgamesh and do the reading guide , does anyone know where the part of Tablet II is where it says that Enkidu is crying ( #20 ) or what quest Enkidu and Gilgamesh set off together on ( #21 ) ? 
So homecoming's tonight , and I'm rocking it in converse shoes . Hellz yeah . 
Now I remember why I gave up crying , it sucks . 
Too much homework . D: 
Today's just not my day . Car crash = it's broken so badly that the car won't even start and the radiator lost all its fluid . So in addition to being a little shaken up and some minor headaches , I might not be at school tomorrow . 
Went to the ER today since that's where my pediatric doctor sent me . Just a slight concussion . 
If you really knew me , you'd see past the smiles and giggles . I love making others smile ( seriously , like with a passion ) but hate myself afterward for being so dependent on someone else's happiness and opinion . 
I love < PROPFIRST > Saunders <3 Just to remind her 
I am the shadow on the < PROPFEMALE > at night , filling your dreams to the brim with fright . 
Saudade 
Lady Antebellum concert tonight ? Hellz yeah . 
Freaking A . Too much to deal with just for tonight . Why did I leave so much homework until now ? 
I love my friends with my entire heart . They mean the absolute world to me . I don't care where tomorrow takes me so long as I have them with me today . 
Royally f-ing things up , once again . Yes , this night just got worse . Very smooth < PROPFEMALE > . 
College applications suck enough as it is . My mother has to make it way worse . oF course I don't want to do these ! They suck , everyone knows it . Are you really freaking surprised I'm not interested in doing them ? PS < PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > are amazingly awesome . PSS I did not leave my facebook open . PSSS Damn straight woman (; 
I hate the dreams you wish more than anything to be true . The ones where you can see every aspect perfectly . And you realize half way through them that they're too perfect to be true ; that they say the things you've been wishing to hear for an eternity . And the person you're missing the most , wraps their arms around you and you can still smell the sweet aroma of their hair as you wake up . Yes , I hate those dreams . 
I'm uber excited Halloween , I just love my costume . <3 
I'm really excited for Humanities . Toga ! 
I hate when nothing happens and suddenly you're really upset . 
Focusing on the things that made this a good weekend : Awesome to see my girl , Ash , on Friday <3 < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > bring me ice cream on Friday (: < PROPFEMALE > Lakatos spending the night Friday and Saturday , catching up with < PROPFIRST > St. < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > ? Cochran for 6 hours on Saturday , and finally carving pumpkins with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Mumaw and < PROPMALE > Brown on Sunday

I hope everyone had some fun at my party , if not we'll have to < PROPFEMALE > out again sometime to prove that I actually am fun to be around . By the way , did anyone leave their phone here ? It's a Verizon phone . 
thinks her facebook is pretty and should be more focuseed on the people at her house >.< haha I love her oh so dearly !!! \ 
Love , < PROPFIRST > Saunders 
I'm laying on the floor , my hair sprawled out across the ground , listening to the music that defines my past . As the heat of the fireplace scolds my back , all I can think of is whether the next step will push me off the edge or if that happened long ago . 
I seriously just went through over 5 months of facebook notifications and postings and still couldn't find the status where everyone ' liked ' it if they were willing to let me draw a picture of them . So if you guys would be so kind , would you please to that again ? < PROPFEMALE > , I know you said you wanted me to draw you but everyone else please ? 
I used to fear how broken you would be without me , now I fear how broken I'm going to be without you . 
So yeah , uh , whoops . 
Grumble grumble grrrrrr * bangs head against desk a few hundred times * 
is actually doing her homework at a reasonable time ...? What is the world coming to ? 
Step 1 completed , I'm one step farther than I was before . Even though the journey isn't what you want , doesn't mean that it isn't completely what you need . 
United Way just emailed me about something that I thought was very cool . It's called a < PROPMALE > Bear Toss which will be taking place at Compuware Arena very soon ! It's when the home team scores it's first goal everyone throws a < PROPMALE > bear ( that they donate ) onto the ice . All the < PROPMALE > bears are then donated to hospitals and charities . The game is set for December 3rd , which is a Friday . Anyone want to go ?

My mother makes fun of me for not remembering what the Parthenon is called after 30 seconds but thinks it's oKay that she can't remember the title of Cat in the Hat right away ?

Guys , do me a favor and respond to this : When did you first start reading/had a parent read you Dr. Seuss ?

Let's get down to business ... to defeat .. this stupid physics project . 
These wonderful things are the things we remember all through our lives 
The roads are terrible . It canceled my plans for tonight since it took four freaking hours to get home > : 
Things just seem to go from terrible to worse . 
She's such a distraction ...

thinks that < PROPFIRST > Saunders is delusional and needs help deciding what awesome thing to buy with my Christmas money . Suggestions please ^w^ 
is still doing applications ... anyway . I just found the conversation between < PROPFIRST > Williamsington and < PROPFEMALE > Leeson ( hilarious by the way ) but who is planning to come over to my house tonight ? I need to know how much food to buy so I have enough if < PROPMALE > Brown and < PROPFIRST > Kitz are going to be there . Lol ^w^ 
If I'm not the one thing you can't stand to lose , if I'm not that arrow to the heart of you , if you don't get drunk on my kiss , if you think you can do better than this I guess we're done . Don't drag this on , consider me gone . Consider me a memory , consider me the past , consider me a smiling in an old photograph , someone who used to make you laugh . Oh < PROPFEMALE > how I love your music <3 
Hurts inside . 
Can't sleep . Delightful . 
has stolen < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Vliet and locked him in my basement . No worries though , I left him skittles to feed on . :3 
Accepted to Kettering ! W00t W00t ! 2 out of 13 so far :3 
When did I become such a flirt ? My apologizes to < PROPMALE > Brown , < PROPFIRST > Talbott , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > , < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Vliet , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , and anyone else who has ever been asked if they were going out with me . 
Has decided that sitting alone just reading for the rest of the night sounds simply amazing . 
What did I learn today ? Only 152 days until graduation . What can I look forward to tomorrow ? It's one day closer to leaving . 
I hate getting drunk texts , sorry but it makes you seem really annoying . 
Enjoy your mistakes , I won't be one of them anymore . You've done enough to me . 
My costume is almost finished for humanities :D Huge , mega , enormous , gigantic thank goes to Mrs. < PROPMALE > for helping me make it . I love it <3 
Oh asthma how you take my breath away * swoon * 
The doctor said I lost 7 pounds since my last visit ... * Fail * I'm not even trying to lose weight . D: 
just wants to be alone . 
I've never heard silence quite this loud . 
Attempting sleep . Oh how miserably this will fail . Another sleepless night <3 
I'm pushing up daisies , I wish they were roses . 
Moving on <3 
Oh dear , all nighter ahead . I'm gonna need some music .

\I want to see you in lesbian shorts . \ " Thank you < PROPFEMALE > Rowe " 
Yay for being a runaway ! 
Ugh , why do people have to frustrate and upset me to no end ? 
Hmm , life sure does a good job making sure that it's interesting . 
I've sadly realized how many people I hate . 
lolololololololol !!!!!! 111 !!! one !!! 1 < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Vliet is the coolest , < PROPMALE > Brown is dumb >:P 
Going to sleep early and hoping for less tears tonight . 
Hanging out with < PROPMALE > Brown and < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Vliet ? Sounds like a good day . 
College interview later this morning ... probably should try sleep thing ... 
Can't breathe . Thank you strep throat . 
Time to sleep . Glee and new badass boots make me happy <3 
Today sucked , truly . Playing in the snow and falling into it so it was up to my waist while jamming out to music ? Amazing . I don't need the drama and shit that stand in my way . Just try to hold me back . <3 
< PROPMALE > Brown is awesome :3 I love him <3 
Fuck these tears . 
That moment when you realize it's 11:11 and don't have anything to wish for . Not that life is perfect , just there's nothing you can think of changing . 
Feels like crap . I don't even want to go to school . 
Wow <3 
has surprisingly cooler parents than expected . * Approves * 
had an awesome day with < PROPFIRST > Talbott . My music greatly thanks you <3 We need to do that more often . 
has been accepted to Purdue . Another college to add to my list to drive me insane . 
is currently in California . I got a life size sea otter at the aquarium . So cute :3 Our cruise leaves tomorrow for Mexico . 
missing < PROPFIRST > Saunders . This will make for one long week :( 
Finally home . 2 friend requests , 5 messages , 10 notifications , and 17 text messages later . I miss my friends . 
finally saw < PROPFEMALE > Wars . I owe it all to < PROPFIRST > Talbott 
Tonight looks like a good night to go crazy . Yep , I think that's the plan . Sounds like fun . 
is about ready to cry after her long log didn't save last night . 
Even my skinny jeans are too big now . Anyone want to go belt shopping with me ? 
She's such a space invader .... and no I'm not talking about Tilly . 
Going out for ice cream rather than doing homework ? Sounds good to me . 
Sleepy sleepy sleepy . Signing off facebook early tonight . Sweet dreams world . Thanks goes to < PROPFIRST > Saunders , < PROPFEMALE > Soucy , < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Vliet , and < PROPMALE > Brown for making this weekend amazing . 
is in such a good and healthy mood . Having a salad with tomatoes , carrots , peapods , and radishes . Then going for a run . So excited . 
came home frustrated and tired from robots . Discovered talking to people wasn't much better . Love my life so much . 
Gained weight :D 
The sound of rain pattering against my window is music to my ears . 
finished getting all her neccessities for her St. < PROPFIRST>'s Day outfit . You have to see me tomorrow . Must see ! 
Love is being curled up beside a warm fire . <3 
Pure bliss is walking alone on an early spring night , wrapped in the feel of the earth waking up from a cold slumber . 
Oh geeze , might have actually decided on a college . 
Accepted to University of Michigan < PROPFEMALE > Arbor 
Stupid colleges . I hate you all . Accepted to < PROPFEMALE > Tech as well . Yay for headaches when it comes to deciding . 
is in a great mood . Some two new sweatshirts that are so comfy <3 Has a prom dress , prom shoes , prom date with one of her best friends , and possibly the hairstyle picked out too . The weather is getting warmer which is amazing . And is about to watch Food Network with her mommy . I just love when everything in life seems to finally fall in place . 
ended up on an anorexic website . It's amazing the lengths that these people are willing to go to . They cry and become upset for eating 600 calories in a day , usually resorting to \fasting\ " . The part that was more amazing to me was how many people there were to support them and telling them not to give up and try harder for tomorrow . I find it very sad that we live in a society that has made girls and boys into this . " 
Entrepreneurship award . Yay my build season paid off ^w^ 
< PROPFEMALE > Miserables with < PROPMALE > Brown :D 
couldn't have asked for a more amazing night . The play was fantastic , the food was the delicious , and the company was of the best . 
is making cookies with < PROPMALE > 
I was never braver than you , I was just better at hiding it . 
Sigh , I don't know what to do anymore . I guess it's good that college is in a few months and it won't matter what I should or shouldn't do . 
Rawr , feeling majorly stressed right now . Have to run around like a mad woman tomorrow getting signatures , turning in applications , and finalizing everything else . Someone please just kill me now . 
Day just keeps getting better . @_@ 
Shhh ... It's late so I'll share my secret with you . I listen to country music to make me feel better . 
All nighter = My favorite <3
