neeed ...... something ...... to do !!!!! 

note to self : i miss you terribly , this is what we call a tragedy , come back to me , come back to me , to me ... 
why is shit so confusing ? and why does it feel like i keep falling for these games and still end up in the same position ? is there really only one reason to say no ? 
spilling the mind and whats left of a heart onto paper all that i can do with them anymore 
one ... two ... hey fuck you ! three ... four ... she's a fucking whore ! five ... six ... check out this bitch ! seven ... eight ... she's nothing great ! nine ... ten ... she's fuckin someone else again ! 
cupid shot an arrow and it pierced my eye , because i cant help but stare every time she walk by , one day mabey ill get the nerve to try , but right now i couldnt handle rejection my heart may die 
what do you do when the one you truely love appears to feel almost nothing for you and everything for someone else 
love is a four letter word , but so is pain , they always come together and everything seems so mundane , all i ever wanted was to give you my love , but now im looking down at you from up above , you seem happy now without me , i gues this is just how things had to be , i gues this is it , saying goodbye , i just wish your love wasnt a lie

When Two Become One , my story for creative writing , is on one of my note thingys and i wana hear what yall think of it 
im loosing control of my head and i fear that its time to get crazy , im loosing my sanity again and again , they say im sick and i need medicine , but i wont take it cuz there is nothin that can help me from all these voices in my head again 
Peace < PROPFEMALE > ! goin to Vegas , but ill be back 
tomorrow , i come home . cant wait to come back to my bed and my friends that i call family 
any body know if it is an A or B day tomarrow ? i am clueless 
fighting to keep my eyes open is not fun 
I'm gone and hot headed when rage gets the best of me , I'm falling to pieces so you can blame it on the rest of me , My heart and soul especially , They got the keys to my mind as we ride over drive into < PROPFEMALE > 
i has popcorn and my cat is begging me for some 
wooo finally got some artwork up here 
my minds became your wind-up toy spun so tight that ill never stop 
i totaly wana do something outrageous/ridiculous/amazing with my hair but idk what 
apparently if your cookie is in three pieces the answer is no 
ever since i can remember , ive always wanted to be a gangster 
why is today sooooooo boorrrrrriiiiinnnnnnnggggg 
Woke up today I was steamin , Cuz when I found out I was not dreamin , Because the host that afloats me the most was a goddam demon 
my throat feels like its trying to kill me . wtf ! 
All my islands have sunk in the deep , So I can hardly relax or even oversleep , I feel as if I were home , some nights , when we count all the ship lights , I guess I’ll never know why sparrows love the snow , We’ll turn off all of the lights and set this ballroom aglow , So tell me darling do you wish we'd fall in love ( All the time ) 
today has been far too uneventfull and boring 
Staring at the setting sun No reason to come back again The twilight world in blue and white The needle and the damage done I don't want to feel this way forever A dead letter marked return to sender So push the seats back a little further Roll the windows down and take a breath I can see the headlights coming They paint the world in red and broken glass 
Dirty History , it's all the same , ain ' no livin ' soul gonna take the blame , For all the suicidal things I did , all the pain that was caused to acheive a wish , Suffering , body recovering , Struggling , when things start bubbling , Can't wash away what's not seen , guess we all gotta little dirty history 
Do I really wanna see so clear even though I know bad things might appear Tell me that it's not a waste of time To ride around and stare up here to try and clear my mind

i must be blind becuase i cannot see what she saw in this world that she loved ever so much 
the days of insomnia where all hear is your heart beat , all you see is figments of your immagination and all you feel is that warm blanket you grab ever so tightly as you wait for the sleep that shal never come

Nihilism . 
Imma put my best foot forward on This night , put a couple of hands of grease in my hair an in my eyebrows and now I'm tight . I wanna be with a woman and just This one , but the taste of blood is still on my tongue . If I could just eat food instead of her D boobs , I want this one alive when the morning comes

Insomnia

tomarrow ill be in ohio . 
always been outa my leauge 
i dont care what they think about me . my mental evaluation says i need help 
im the one that the fake all love to hate , but know everthing about me like we used to date . its time to set things straight cuz im the super killa fragalistic one thats great 
i dont care about a punk ass shrink , all he wants to do is medicate the way i think , and i can do that shit on my own , so i dont need any help from some unknown , head therapist tellin me how it is , trying to get me to tell them my bis , i get pissed i dont need this fool , you think ima break down and trust you ? i dont care what they think about me , my mental evaluation says i need help 
tonight , i go to sonar 
i want your heart , your soul , and your mind , but you gave me your body , your tears , and your blood . 
time ... to find something to do 
school ... definitely hating it . hours upon hours of almost every day taken out of your life , all for what ? a piece of paper that some employers cream their pants over . woopdydo . id rather just work for the rest of my life on this earth . i fucking hate school 
what happens when you thought you could , but cant . when everyone has such high hope and goals for you , but they're too far out of reach . when things so precious to you will get taken away , all because your just trying to keep sanity and control . this is failure . 
< *mah jeh mah* > 
shutdown . 
im on my way , im moving top speed , no lookin back so dont even wave to me , im goin forward , time to change what i believe . in other words im following my dreams . 
cant nobody change me or what i believe , so i make it a need to go out and achieve , out done by god's son , fueled my death's run , thought my time was up but my journey has just begun . 
congratulations facebook ! i hate you ! 
this is the time to unravel the strings of chaos , when your mind is missing so much time but hasn't lost , anything , everything , bring what you need , because life now rides on death's steed , leaving a trail of death and decay , now watch as all our lives wither away . 
yeahh .... so how long does it take for the pain to actually be worth waiting ? wish i could answer that 
im so abstract when it comes to my flow , you can blame it on the holy water cuz its got my hyped . forreal 
if i keep holding my breath , all of this will fade away . \ 
\ 
if you keep driving we'll be lying in the wreck . \ 
changing the shape , \ 
folding like an envelope to keep each other in . \ 
shattered glass , broken looks , and mascara gets\ 
washed away by windshield wiper blades . 
do i really wana see so clear even tho i know bad things might appear 
Ive got some issue that nobody can see and all of these emotions are pouring outta me 
i was at work when i thought of this : its been over 9 months since my last relationship and sadly that was shitty and short-lived , whats more sad is that the one before that was another 9 or 10 months before . its been a while ... 
words cant describe these feelings 
yea . i fucked up . big time . 
its not fun sharing a body and mind 
i gues we all got some dirty histroy 
got a new job 
how is it that its so easy to love others but so hard to love thyself 
sometimes i truely wonder if you words really ment anything that night ... 
father , hold my head and hand steady as i walk through the valley of all that is evil , and pray for those who cross my path , for they must face my swift hand of wrath , as the world sees its final task , its final test . a chapter that is I .

Haters always hatin , fakers always perpetratin , All believers always scheming hate to see us celebratin , All the quiters , all the snitchers always gossipin and trippin , They have no ambition so they can't see my vision 
new speakers ? 
valentines day , the most pathetic excuse of a holiday . purely made to make money for hallmark , chocolate companies , and florists
