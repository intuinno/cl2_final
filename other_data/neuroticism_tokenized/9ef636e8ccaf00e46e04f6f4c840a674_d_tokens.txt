... but that you will always love them . Repost if you are lucky to have some\ 
of these friends . I am privileged to say that I do ? ? ?

Dear Mr. Obama , Thank you for not going to Arlington National Cemetery on Memorial Day . There is something very sacred about that place and about that day . Those who bled and died for this country deserve to be honored and saluted by people who love their country and honor their sacrifice . You don't belong there . Thank you for realizing that and going to Chicago . -Craig P . Jacobi , Col , USA , ( Ret )
