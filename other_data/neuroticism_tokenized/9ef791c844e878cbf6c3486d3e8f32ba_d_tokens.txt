Watched the Blind Side ! OMG suuuuuuuuch a great movie ! Definately a buy ! ;) 
In my true mind & hearts-eye ... I am a conundrum wrapped in ambiguation ; sprinkled with adventure , rolled in glitter and floating on a whim . I may be intriguing for some and frustrating for others , but I am ME just the same . ? 
Lord , please give me strength ... 
Up WAYYYYYY too late , but got ALOT accomplished so YAYYYY for that ! It's all good . I'll sleep better knowing its done ! :) 
Everything happens for a reason ... through faith , perseverance and love ... I shall see His path for me ... living life through God's plan and in God's hand . Through Him all things are possible . <3

I trust in the Lord with all my heart <3 to guide me in the direction of the path He has designed for me . :) 
The Lord has blessed me w/ You ... You don't even know how much you have changed me . I'm so thankful for the love you have given me , the friendship you've shown me & the strengths you have emulated through my weakest moments . You make me smile all day through & for all my doubts , worries and fears you only have all the right things to say ... You are my blessing my love and I want you to know , I'll be forever true ... <3 
Praying for what God has in store ... hoping I'm ready <3 
Everything happens for a reason ... & I have a sneaking suspicion that the Lord has been throwing up barriers to force me in the right direction ... obviously I wasn't getting the subtle guidance He has been giving me through the power of choice ... thank u Lord for breakin out the ninja moves ! ;D <3 
The beauty u see in my eyes is purely a reflection of what I see in u ...? 
Even the ocean as beautiful as it is , can become relentless with the right variables ...

If u only knew how u make the day sparkle ... <3 
I am SO very thankful for all of the many blessings the Lord has given me . <3 Everything in life happens for a reason & sometimes the biggest blessings are in the unanswered prayers . For if those prayers had been answered for me I would not have all of the wonderful things that He has blessed me with since ... <3 
So excited about what the future holds ... <3 the possibilities are endless ... 
I love u like Summertime ... Like a preacher loves Sunday ... Love u like a freeze pop ... Love u like a high school girl on a first date ... Love u like shooting stars ...

Whats meant to be will always find its way <3 
So I just got a link sent to me about Romantic Compatabilities & realtionships ... \ 
\ 
PISCES is a very flamboyant sign , and is almost completely ruled by emotion . As such , a relationship with a Pisces is an all-consuming experience that you need to be prepared to devote some time to . They will reward you with undying loyalty and showers of affection , but are also easily hurt and angered . \ 
WOW ... oh so true ... <3 
Today is the first day in the rest of your life ... What will you make of it ? Your choice for tomorrow starts with today . <3 
In dealing with matters of the heart ... don't attempt to tear down a fence until u know why it was put up in the first place ... <3 <3 
Seeking clarity , definition , direction , prosperity and happiness within & for the passions of my heart , my life & my purpose ... Lord , please help me to embrace an open heart , open mind and the < PROPFEMALE > needed to reach my desired point of reflection and the strength & diligence to make an impact . Amen . <3

Being happy doesn't mean that everything is perfect . It just means that you've decided to look beyond the imperfections . <3 
Sometimes people feel trapped in an impossible situation only to discover that they had only been trapped by their lack of ability to imagine an alternative . 
You can make all the excuses you want for why you're unhappy , or you can bite the bullet and make changes . Either way , it's your decision . 
Happy Daddy's Day to all my daddys out there ! Hope u have an amazing day ! <3 <3 <3 ;) 
Nobody is perfect ; until u fall in love with them . <3 
Tough times don't last , but tough people do . :) 
Anyone want to be my pen-pal ?? lol ... I want to be excited to check the mail again ... :) 
Do u know that I'm thinking of you ? If I wrote you a love letter , would you write back ? 
Sometimes the best thing u can do is to take a step back & realize what's truly important , count ur blessings & take a deep breath . All that's meant to be will be . <3 
Do not worry of tomorrow , for tomorrow will take care of itself . Each day is filled with enough to handle then to be worrying of the next . Free your heart & embrace each day as it is . There are blessings in each day that shouldn't be missed in the midst of your worries of tomorrow . <3 
I am SO thankful ... the Lord has blessed me with some emotional stress relief today & has given me some clarity on the things that have been heavy on my heart . I did not ask this of Him although I should have & by giving me this He has assured me that my directions should be led thru Him ... for thru Him all things are possible . <3 
Lazy day today , it was nice . <3 
Never make someone a priority , who only makes you an option . 
Alright , so the weather is looking like its gonna be really great tomorrow ! Yaayyyyy ! BBQ @ my place ! I'm gonna pick up some stuff for the bbq @ some drinks but bring whatever !

Are you thinking about me ? I'm thinking about you ... <3 
It's all so amazing ... <3 
Take time on me ... I promise u it will be worth it <3 
It's all a process .... and yet I'm feeling so far removed from it in every way ...

Today will never happen again in ur lifetime or the lifetimes of ur children ... Make something new of today and take a moment to realize that each day is fleeting and u only have one life to live ... <3 Happy 8-9-10 everyone !

Looking forward to a new chapter ... we are the authors of our destiney ... never sacrifice from the life you were meant to have ... <3 
It is such a beautiful day today ... <3 Be thankful for all that you have been blessed with and take a moment to reflect on what is truly important to you . Take action to fill those opportunities and relationships with all that you have to give . We only have one moment to decide for each moment is fleeting and will never return . Make sure that you are reflecting in action what you hold true in your heart . <3 
I wish that even for a moment , you could see you thru my eyes ... then u would see how truly beautiful you are . <3

\I Believe Everything Happens For A Reason ... \ 
It's going to be a long and tedious road ahead , but the light at the end of the tunnel is shinning bright and the Lord is holding my hand . Could this be the new beginning that I have been hoping and praying for ?? I think it just might ... <3 
La la la , la la la , you make me smile :D 
Through Him all things are possible . <3 I find my strength in Him , my comfort in Him , support & love through Him . Through the trials of my life it is in Him I put my faith . <3 
It's time to make a difference <3 We only have one life and one world to live in ... <3 
Today is a new day ... <3 
Every day we are given the opportunity to make a difference ... in the outcome of our < PROPFEMALE > , in the life of a child , in the preservation of our environment , in HOW we make a difference ... & each day through the differences we make , we can emulate true LOVE through our choice in actions ... So , in turn the question becomes , how will you LOVE today ? Will you chose to love today , by chosing to make a difference ? <3 
Girl Scouts !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We are officially in Brownies ! Yaayyy ! * Happy Dance * Let's make it a great day ! ;D

I was never one to patiently pick up broken fragments and glue them together again and tell myself that the mended whole was as good as new . What is broken is broken - and I'd rather remember it as it was at its best than mend it and see the broken places as long as I live . 
There are times in life that it seems impossible 2 see the light @ the end of the tunnel through all the trials & assaults & sleeze . It is in these moments that I'm especially thankful 4 all of the many blessings the Lord has given me ; for all of the love & support that the Lord has allowed 4 me . It is the Lord who undoubtedly knows the truth , sees all things & shall protect me from those who are unjust against me <3 
The Lord works in beautiful ways ? It's time to breathe ... 
Had a very refreshing weekend . Great way to start the new chapter ... <3 
It's not always what your doing in life that's important . It's what you are becoming ... <3 
Everyday I am so beautifully reminded of how very lucky I am ... and I only have the Lord to thank . It is through the trials in this life that while finding ourselves we find Him ... <3 
Love , love , LOVE the rain ! Could use a big fluffy blanket , a cup of cocoa and my cuddling < PROPMALE > right now ! <3 :) 
Still living each day as if it could be the one that leads to ' happily ever after ' ... <3 
Its amazing when we look back on the difficult periods in our lives , how we can so clearly see the necessary life lessons , self changes , otherwise missed opportunities , incredible people and seemingly random series of events ... that we were meant to experience , endure , appreciate and love . It is thru God's plan that we will truly < PROPFEMALE > , grow and move towards a clearer happiness . <3 
Every day I think of you ... And every night I dream of you ... <3 
I'm not sure where this turn is taking me , but I pray to gain the stability and peace of mind we so desperately need . 
Sometimes people feel trapped in an impossible situation only to discover that they had only been trapped by their lack of ability to imagine an alternative ... pondering my alternatives ...

What is broken is broken - and I'd rather remember it as it was at its best than mend it and see the broken places as long as I live . Moving forward to a better life ... <3 
Sometimes u just have to stop and watch the clouds go by ... <3 
So thankful for the blessings in my life ... for those that the Lord has put in my life to make me laugh , smile and love ... so amazingly that it seems nothing else is that big at all ... <3 
Sometimes we are so wrapped up in our daily trials that it is hard to see through it all ... but sometimes just taking a step outside the box can really give us the perspective of the Lord at work and remind us that its all in his hands . 
Everything happens for a reason ... what is meant to be will be ... <3 Lord please < PROPMALE > me the strength to accept what I cannot change and < PROPMALE > me peace in dealing with all the rest ... 
Looking forward to the future ... <3

Every day we are given the opportunity to self and life evaluate , to be better , to grow , and to deliberately move in a more intentional direction to who we want to BE and who we want to BECOME .
