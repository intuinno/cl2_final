Sleep opens within us an inn for phantoms . In the morning we must sweep out the shadows . ~ Gaston Bachelard 
“I still find each day too short for all the thoughts I want to think , all the walks I want to take , all the books I want to read , and all the friends I want to see . ” - < PROPFIRST > Burroughs 
It's inhumane to force people who have a genuine medical need for coffee to wait in line behind people who view it as some kind of recreational activity . This kind of thing doesn't happen to heroin addicts . I bet when serious heroin addicts ... go to purchase their heroin , they do not tolerate waiting in line while some dilettante in front of them orders a hazelnut smack-a-cino with cinnamon sprinkles - < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > 
“Journalist : a person without any ideas but with an ability to express them ; a writer whose skill is improved by a deadline : the more time they have , the worse they write . ” - < PROPFIRST > Kraus

\Behind every successful woman is a substantial amount of coffee . \ " ~ Stephanie Piro " 
“There is neither happiness nor misery in the world ; there is only the comparison of one state to another , nothing more . He who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness . We must have felt what it is to die , that we may appreciate the enjoyments of life . ” - < PROPFIRST > Dumas 
listening to some JT , working on a response , and trying not to think about Smallville . . . it's like TV crack .

It is necessary to write , if the days are not to slip emptily by . How else , indeed , to clap the net over the butterfly of the moment ? For the moment passes , it is forgotten ; the mood is gone ; life itself isgone . That is where the writer scores over his fellows : he catches ... the changes of his mind on the hop . ~ Vita Sackville-West

You\

inside you . And we edit to let the fire show through the smoke . \
