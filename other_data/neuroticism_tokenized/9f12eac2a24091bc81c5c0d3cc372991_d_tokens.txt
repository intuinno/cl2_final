I believe in Jesus Christ and have accepted Him as my personal Savior . One person on FB has challenged all believers to put this on their wall ... In the Bible it says , if you deny Me in front of your peers , I will deny you before my Father at The Gates of Heaven . ( Mat 10:33 ) This is simple ... If you love God and you are not afraid to show it , re-post this . Just copy and paste . ... no shame here 
well we didnt win our game but we tied and im happy with that considering we came back
