Payday Friday is the only day better than the other Friday , and the only day better than both is the day the lottery check appears 

Wondering where the servants are with my coffee , paper , and vitamin-enriched Bloody < PROPFIRST > ... 
\Many of us spend our whole lives running from feeling with the mistaken belief that you cannot bear the pain . But you have already borne the pain . What you have not done is feel all you are beyond that pain . \ " \ 
Sign that I have reached enlightenment : perfect contentment with standing in line to get a number in order to get in lottery to talk to clerk at the drivers license bureau 
Second sign of enlightenment : that I am not the least bit repulsed that people choose not to bathe for a week before getting in line to get a number in order to get in lottery to talk to clerk at drivers license bureau

Finished the move last night out of midtown to downtown ! Fourth move in about a yearand one lesson I've learned : quit buying stuff ! 
Reason 532 to find Tiger distasteful and Sir < PROPFIRST > fabulous : ex Vegas MGM employee said Tiger so cheap he removed a $5 trip from waitress's tray that Elle tried to tip . Barkley on the other hand : big time tipper ! 
Dear tobacco smoking friends : most of y'all are younger than me . A classmate just died from COPD . So it isnt just a potential loss of boners or ugly saggy skin in 20s and 30s to consider . Breaks my heart to think of losing any of you so very soon . 
1.5 hours until NAKID kickball game . 
We got rained out and NAKID stands for No Adult Kickball Isn't Dumb . Cute , huh ? I don't think mid forties is the right time for people to start participating in actual nude sports ... I'm not sure what the right decade would be but am certain this one isn't it . Might be fun in my eighties ... 
Oh my word ... Pippa Middleton has the weirdest right eyebrow evah ... it like starts adjacent to her < PROPFEMALE > when she is looking straight ... she is this beautiful creature with one effed-up eyebrow . Wtf ? I would so < PROPFEMALE > my waxer . 
I'm kinda getting tired of the face part of Facebook and wishing someone would say something interesting ... since I no longer read I have nothing interesting to say so it would be great if one of you people would give a brother some material . 
Stumbled on quotekiss.com and I think I might vomit . It is a neverending Hallmark card about how-u-complete-me ... it has to be the home < PROPFEMALE > of those people that dart their letter i's with hearts ... yeah , I took the morning off work and am avoiding going in this afternoon ... I want to close my eyes forever or at least until quitting time . 
Swimming pool at the new place is so gr8 for observing the mating rituals of the tragically hip . 
Austinite : Jalapeno Hibiscus Martini at Sushi Zushi is a must try . Delectable 
Leaving < PROPMALE > , on the way to Vail ... feels hotter here than in Texas . Its not the heat , its the dry . 
Issue a blanket pardon , forgive everyone who has ever hurt you in any way . Forgiveness is a perfectly selfish act . It sets you free from the past . \

Aging has given me far more than it has taken away ... next stage I look forward to is when I am in such < PROPFEMALE > that most of my thoughts need no editing and I have no qualms about putting words to thoughts I deem edit-worthy now . 
We are the women our parents warned us about , and we are proud . \

Does anybody else see the lottery billboard jackpot and spend the entire commute to work spending it ? Which decadent purchase are u most ashamed to admit you would make , you know after u donated the obligatory chunk to < PROPFEMALE > so that everybody doesn't grumble about what a solipsistic asshole you are ? 
Managing anger : I am conditioning to think cool thoughts so when data enters my brain and passes through the emotions/limbic center on the way to the frontal cortex for logical processing , the data hasn't been corrupted by emotion . Daily win/loss = 6/1 
God is in His heaven and all is right in the world ... I just got carded ... I'm winning ... I've got tigers blood . 
Hook ' em 
Getting pedicure and I swear to God the nail technician is totally talking smack in Vietnamese about how disgusting my feet are ... she could at least wipe the look of terror off her face ... she actually just said to me that she thinks I lost five pounds in dead skin that she just scraped off ... so I got that going for me . 
If you had an hour to live , who would u call and what would u say ? \ 
Why r u waiting ? 
I thought this was cool in the \We are the women our parents warned us about

Who else is joining Google+ and live a peaceful , compartmentalized life ? 
Cattlecall on Southwest ... waiting in seat for group C meaning I get to sit in non-reclining seat at back of plane next to screaming baby with dirty diaper ... as I sit patiently , some lovely gentleman stands in my face and releases silent but deadly fart . Where or where did I take the turn that landed me here today on this God forsaken airline that discriminates against the obese , gay and girls in mini skirts , but welcomes the flatulent ? Sigh 
No baby , but f*cker next to me has baloney burps . Help me !!! % 
Thank you all for your warm birthday wishes .! Very lovely . 
Went to Bikram ( 105 degree 90 minute yoga ) with #1 son today and am exceedingly proud of both of us and grateful that torture can feel so great ... menopause schmenopause
