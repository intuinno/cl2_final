Heading south .

Safely back in my new hometown . No one with which to < PROPFEMALE > around .

two weeks away means that everything in the fridge is probably gone wrong . off the the < PROPFIRST > meyer .

Sweetheart you'll find ; mediocre people do exceptional things all the time . 
While you SCREAM at your woman , there's a \ 
man wishing he could talk softly in her ear . While you HUMILIATE , OFFEND \ 
and INSULT her , there's a man flirting with her and reminding her how \ 
wonderful she is . While you HURT your woman , there's a man wishing he \ 
could make love to her . While you make your woman CRY there's a man \ 
stealing smiles from her ... Post this on your wall if you're against \ 
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
Love yourself ... from everything within ... You are who you are because you chose to be . Then , if you choose to be like that , love yourself . If you don't love the way you are , then be the change you want to be ... 
Time to hop in the shower and get ready for a \half\ " day of work . " 
Baking : It's like science for hungry people . 
Great minds discuss ideas . Average minds discuss events . Small minds discuss people .

Obvious bot is obvious . 
Happy national underwear day ! 
6 hours to sleep then back to work ]-P 
Why is it when I join a conversation , it never stays on topic ? 
May we be able to look back on our lives when we're old and say ... 
Try commenting on this , my last post received comments , but none are visable . So , I'm just curious . 
I miss my math class . Start posting math stumpers . I need a challenge . 
Just leased a new Insight . Take delivery tomorrow . 
Drill weekend , I am so ready . 
Yarr !!! 
The opera scene from The Fifth Element is quite possible the best piece of cinematography evar ! 
It's not stupid . It's advanced . 
Let's drive until the gas is gone , \ 
we'll walk until our feet are torn , \ 
we'll crawl until we feed the soil ... 
Woke up cold one Tuesday , \ 
I'm looking tired and feeling quite sick , \ 
I felt like there was something missing in my day to day life , \ 
So I quickly opened the wardrobe , \ 
Pulled out some jeans and a T-Shirt that seemed clean , \ 
Topped it off with a pair of old shoes , \ 
That were ripped around the seams , \ 
And I thought these shoes just don't suit me . 
And now ... to chores 
On the road I dream of home ; when at home I dream of action . 
I'm still a note that's unplayed , ink on a < PROPFEMALE > , I'm still , I'm still 
How should I kick off my weekend ? 
really ? who thought this would be a good idea ? 
is running . 
Happy 2nd Birthday , Maleah ! 
So tomorrow Maleah gets a new sister . Then I get a couple of weeks to help my wife recover and survive two kids . Should I take this opportunity to see how great of a beard I can grow ? 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Oposnow was born 8:06 am PST . She is 9lbs . 1oz . and 21in . Very healthy and beautiful . Pics to follow . 
< PROPFEMALE > , Maleah , < PROPFEMALE > and I are all finally home together .

On the Board of Directors and the VP of my < PROPFEMALE > .

The DJ at this reception didn't think to play < PROPFIRST > Be Good after playing Earth Angel , but I bet they play Kid Rock's Summertime after this track of Sweet Home Alabama . 
time for bed ; this ten-day work week sure has its benefits , but they are hard to see this early in the week . 
Wow ! Who knew that two little letters could be so hurtful ... 
Tell me your weakness .
