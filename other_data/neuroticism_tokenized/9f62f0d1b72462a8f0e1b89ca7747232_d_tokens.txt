Spent the day dodging the rain and so I took < PROPMALE > to see Land of the Lost today . Although there were some funny parts , I felt like this should have been rated R . It is really not for children because of the adult comedy that is involved .

kind of scared . a tornado is brewing only a few < PROPMALE > away 
last night at BMX < PROPMALE > placed 4th . He would have placed higher but another kid spun out in front of him and then < PROPMALE > ran over his belly ! The poor kid . I pray to God that < PROPMALE > never gets hurt like that . But , I can guarantee that kid will come ba 
got back from our church carnival and going to dodge the rain tonight for a nice fathers day dinner with steves dad !

upset that every time I like a new food or beverage , someone has to say it is bad for me ... this time it is soy milk . Suddenly this beverage is bad because it has estrogens in it that cause weight gain ... whatever .
