uh sunburns suck shopuld of posted saturday and now my face is shedding like a snake lol 
imaginie chaos in ur life beyond anything as if everyone hates u and is throwing daggers at ur heart and throat watching the streets begin to burn as u step into the hell that is ur life in shattered peices just left to burn and die into the mystery of misery huh u ask but im fine this is the hell ive created my inward chaos is the most beutifull thing i have in life 
ok im doing my own challange here for one week i dare all of u to say what really goes on in ur life and start it like this if u really knew me ud know that at times its only memories of happier times that get me through a day 
< PROPFEMALE > not on ur own understanding for that is death but < PROPFEMALE > on the understanding of the lord which is life and fulfillment 
blessed are those who know the lord and walk in ways of rightousness but cursed are those who know the lord and yet in there own ignorance still walk in the ways of sin 
i usually only do one verse a day but i just have that nudging feeling that god wants me to say this for someone who needs it . it will take two posts so read the comment to . hebrews ch . 12 therefore since we are surrounded by such a huge crowd of witnesses to the life of faith , let us strip off every weight that slows us down , especially the sin that so easily trips us up . 
For our earthly fathers disciplined us for a few years , doing the best they knew how . But God's discipline is always right and good for us because it means we will share in his holiness . \ 
\ 
discipline is enjoyable while it is happening -- it is painful ! But afterward there will be a quiet harvest of right living for those who are trained in this way . 
yawns so yeah overall decent weekend dad and me argued over something stupid said stupid things but afterwords we realized how stupid it was hugged each other and played some music lol iron man by black sabath 
Loveless\

A person you're attracted to may seem to be interested in someone else . This could bring up your insecurities and jealousy . Don't make yourself crazy , Sagittarius . Try to learn the facts before letting the situation get the better of you . Invitations to more than one social event for the same night might force you to make an uncomfortable choice . Make the choice that's best for you . 
The astral configuration of the day puts you in the kind of situation that you usually dislike so intensely : that of having to make a decision . The past and the future are present before you , and each requires a specific kind of action in order for you to be able to move ahead with a current relationship . Tune into your feelings and see what the issue really is really about .
