i think ... im going to attempt to watch every pokemon episode ever made ... which may take a while considering i cant find a torrent for the 1st season thats less than 20GB . so i imagine theres a good amount of pokemon episodes o.O 
If Pokemon were real we would not be training them or having them battle against eachother because it would be illigal , what the difference between battle pokemon & dog fighting or cock fights ? some asshole some where along the way would outlaw it & announce it in the name of animal cruelty
