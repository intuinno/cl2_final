2011 will be a more powerful voice , and a head of beautiful red hair . =) 
I barely ate any fast food during my first semester at UK ( even though I ate a lot of other various prepared foods ) . I'm afraid that might have to change . =(

When I haven't eaten in a while I get really depressed , and when I do finally eat I feel like I'm almost even more of a wreck - for about a half hour , anyway . It's weirdly emotional . =( 
Would someone please explain this ' obamacare ' thing to me ? I feel like there must be something I'm just not getting here . 
cave story on wii . =) 
Wow , Google < PROPFEMALE > is no longer censored . I had no idea this just happened . 
If I hear or see anyone say or post anything from now on that even whiffs of homophobia , sexism , racism , or any other kind of flagrant stupidity , I'll consider you my enemy . I'm tired of giving people 2nd , 3rd , or 4th chances .

I think FaceBook fulfilled my dream of me BECOMING an RSS feed . 
Today I've been outlining an especially controversial article/book about Stockholm Syndrome . I don't know if I'll ever finish it though - it's really ambitious . Maybe I should reconsider becoming a Criminologist and use this as my Dissertation ? 
I told close to a billion people at work I'd be working on Saturday . I actually work on Tuesday evening ! 
Let's not prolong this any further . =) 
Reality is two things : 1 . Cruel , 2 . Persistent .

High-five me if you're closing tonight ! 
Last dance tonight at JCP , working 4-10 . Come say hello and goodbye to me , darlings ! <3

7 years after the invasion of Iraq and 8 years since the invasion of afghanistan , DADT looks like it's finally getting repealed . The washington suits even have the balls to call homeland security a < PROPMALE > concern after all these years of discharging 13,000 soldiers , linguists , and doctors from the front line because they're afraid they're getting eye-raped in the shower . 
The rednecks in our neighborhood have already started letting off fireworks ( which scares our big dogs ) . This will probably continue every night until LATE July or early August . =\\

Funk upon a time , in the days of the Funkapus , the concept of specially-designed Afronauts capable of funkatizing galaxies was first laid on man-child , but was later repossessed and placed among the secrets of the pyramids , until a more positive attitude towards this most sacred phenomenon - clone funk - could be acquired ...

Okay , two of four classes appear to be doable ! Tomorrow I found out about the other two . =)

so a < PROPFEMALE > told me today that a notable gay student at < PROPMALE > county high was beat up and literally CRUCIFIED on the football field goal post after the GSA controversy back in 2002/2003 . Anyone hear anything about this ? I'm hoping it's just urban legend . 
Warm gatorade/water , pure protein bar , and a handful of chip mates . Worst lunch ever .

Fun fact : One of the lengthiest surviving fragments of Sappho's poetry was found scribbled onto a pocket-sized piece of broken pottery by an ancient Egyptian fanboy/girl . How cute . 
So now that DADT has been ruled unconstitutional , are they gonna reinstate the soldiers who were discharged ? 
Wow , that was a pretty h-core nap I just took . Seriously guys . 
Why aren't any of my new friends showing up in my live feed ? =( 
Sorry if my absent-mindedness came out as something rude today ! I didn't mean it to . And if you have no idea what I'm talking about , just disregard it ...

is listening to Jeffree < PROPFEMALE>'s remix of \boom boom pow\ " for the ten millionth time . Mwahahaha " 
I think the internet and all these digital gadgets filling my head with < PROPFIRST > really can't be good for me - it's just like < PROPMALE > said . 
I had a < PROPFEMALE > stuck in my head all this morning but until just about a half hour ago wasn't able to remotely transcribe it . All I could do was keep humming it to myself to remember it . I gave it the old college try but I still don't know if it was good enough , I think I may have confused the < PROPFEMALE > while trying to write it down . fml 
< PROPFEMALE > ... She's crazy but I like it loca loca loca . 
has been getting into < PROPFEMALE > lately . Her voice used to be too irritating to me , but now I'm falling in love with it - not unlike another voice I've grown to love who will remain nameless . <3 
may or may not have been harassed walking back to campus with < PROPMALE > . Funny , I figured I would have been more upset about it . 
I apologize in advance for the fugly outfit I'll be wearing to school today . 
People abuse animals referencing beliefs of human centricism , whilst ironically neglecting what has most consistently been considered distinct human traits : music , art/leisurely expression , philosophy , and perhaps to a lesser degree , language . I'm hopeful for the future of our world , but it has < PROPMALE > obstacles to overcome ... 
how many mistakes can I make in one week ...?

I had a dream I was in NYC last night . Not doing anything that crazy , just navigating the streets , trying not to get run over , and going in pretty much every little shop that appeared to sell used video games or other pop cultural relics ... 
had a successful first trip to CD Central today . Let's just say Half Price Books suddenly got some serious competition for my favorite store . ( P.S. Wondermints for $7.98 !!! )

161910 - You have such a wonderful personality and genuine strength that's rare . You're down-to-earth and I miss the idea of going to work and seeing you there . I miss you and look forward to hanging out with you soon . 
? - You're opinionated where it counts , and you're right about a lot of things . I think the world needs to hear more of what you have to say , but maybe that's just me being a dreamer . You're not a coward by any means , but I think you're afraid of confronting something that's inevitable . I respect you and value our friendship , even if it is just beginning . =) 
Okay , one more : 700 - You know those beautiful and strange movies you watch that capture your whole attention and stays with you forever ? That's what your life is like to me . Over the years we've come together and apart , but you've never left my thoughts . I don't think I've ever written a song about you , but I probably should . You'd make a great muse . =) 
Somehow I gotta rally and do this homework . I'm so bored and uncomfortable I'm tagging random inanimate objects in my photographs . Moreso than usual , even . =( 
I just realized why female equality is so difficult to achieve in developing countries : other than the problem of education , there's also the fact that men in developing countries are so poor and desperate/degraded that to take away their abusive power over women is to take away what little power they have left . It's like how poor people love having kids because when they have kids they feel like they own something . 
Going to take a nap before the second final of today . =) 
Quickly , what is the CP building ? It's not whitehall is it ? I think that's CB . 
This is the prettiest snow I've seen in a very long time ... if not ever . =) 
Lately I've been wondering if my < PROPFEMALE > for reclusion isn't in fact being repressed . Maybe I need to live in a cave for a while to get this out of my system . Or who knows ? Maybe I'll just stay there .

So I was searching for both \lady gaga harpsichord\ " and \ " lady gaga baroque\ " on youtube last night . " 
Another midwinters < PROPFEMALE > with Mulder and Scully ! ( mom - I will call you in an hour or so ) 
my VLC playlist looks just like that of an affluent middle-aged Japanese man . =) 
I'm gonna start calling what I just did \fluster naps \"." 
Anyone here interested in group renting a house or apartment with me in Lexington ? I'm not sure about it , and I wouldn't be able to until around March , but I thought I'd throw it out there . 
< PROPMALE > Cooper . < PROPMALE > Maher . Talking to each other . 
What route is the bus stop outside the UK student center on ? 
Have I ever walked into Outsource with food and NOT left it there ? 
I wish you all could somehow comprehend how badly I want some applesauce right now . 
I have notepad , wordpad , microsoft word , and openoffice.org open all at the same time . 
If you have skills with a tambourine , I have several quarters to give you for lessons ~ ? 
horrible-dietary-decision-while-sick #2 : corned beef hash 
psycho mood right now ... 
Think of 3-5 of the best compliments you could ever imagine receiving . Then never let anybody know about them . If someone mentions one , you know they appreciate you . 
reading recent oricon rankings ... gross lol 
don’t U ? ink ? i ? B wi ? U 
I feel like I can do anything . 
got my bus pass today . No more long walks , friends ! =) 
2am and I can't sleep . Time to try on clothes ! =D

I'm totally there in spirit , guys . <3 
for the people I told I would be coming down to ashland on the weekend - sorry ! It looks like I'll be staying in lexington for several reasons . 
I'd never even seen or heard of a gay man who listened to < PROPFIRST > Bieber [ voluntarily ] until tonight . 
Hey guys let's try not to die on the way to/from school today , okay ? <3 
I successfully looked up a Kanji by its radical for the first time today ! 
Tonight you might see a familiar face at your local drinking establishment ... 
It's hard to distinguish the despicable people from the really great ones . I'm getting better though , and hope to < PROPFEMALE > out with some of them ( the great ones I mean lol ) tonight . =) 
I forgot JPN 102 started a half-hour earlier on Tuesdays . That was my only class of the day . =( 
I wore sweatpants to school today and nobody said anything . Fashion life = destroyed 
I think I write songs about guys I realize aren't worth giving anything else to . 
Today is gonna be so intense . 
lols almost got killed . And a parking permit . Woohoo 
\There's more to this feeling\ 
I have so many song ideas going on right now . One of them is a total heart&chart-crushing ballad . Lovely . 
Really geeky question : is scatting in Japanese lyrics rendered as Hiragana or Katakana ? I think I've seen it written before as Hiragana but I think Katakana makes more sense . 
Listening to ANAMANAGUCHI in the Outsource ... <3 
If the sky should fall into the sea\ 
And the stars fade all around me\ 
Of the time that we have known dear\ 
I will sing a hymn to love 
Whoredom alone does not a Libertine make . 
They don't know I burn .

Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra .

Somebody just put Fergie down ...

Yuppies : starting the rat race early , aren't we ? Also , so many big beautiful snowflakes 
??????????????? <3 ( just brushing up on my Japanese , and thought I'd share this especially beautiful and redundant word - I'm not trying to be \that guy \")" 
I've still not fully collected myself since Hurricane Montgomery . Hanging out with HB Elam last night was fun though . ( I've decided he's my \Sennheiser buddy \".)"

I was mentally critiquing one of my classmates ' outfits ( two instances of mismatched , garish plaid ) until I looked down at the < PROPMALE > & cheese stain on the crotch of my sweatpants . 
so apparently , one of my twitter fans claims to be a CERN technician , aerospace engineer , and h-core poetry aficionado . #ishonored 
I'm having some difficulty imagining how I'm going to come out the other side of today alive . =\\ 
wants Nights of Cabiria on DVD or Blu-Ray . Come on , Criterion Collection . Bring the old girl back again . =( 
This recent victory in Egypt is a powerful reminder that governments don't exist through constitutions , policies , economies , or boundaries . They exist through PEOPLE , and what the people want , they [ eventually ] get . 
drenched my forehead at Soundbar Lexington , now proceeding to ptfo 
I'm thinking about changing my < PROPMALE > to biology/geology so I can pursue my dream of living in the Australian bush , digging up dinosaurs . There are gingers in Australia , right ? 
I hate it when people never respond to my texts . ( Especially the important ones . ) 
relationship advice from < PROPMALE > Cross , < PROPFEMALE > Huddleston , and < PROPFEMALE > Phillips . =] 
having to read Baruch Spinoza for my PHI 270 class is like having to chew up a glass figurine , pull the shards of glass from my gums , then awkwardly piece it back together at gunpoint . In a good way . 
Was NASA affected by the repeal of DADT ? I don't think gays were allowed to be astronauts before . But that may have just been implicit discrimination . 
now if you'll excuse me , I have a date with taco < PROPFEMALE > at jacobson park . ( and oh yeah , < PROPMALE > Neruda might be there as well . ) 
\Any girl can be a magician . They don’t worry about words since they know from experience . To fight off loneliness they take off all their clothes . They remember only the first memorized spell . \"" 
Thriller-dancing with mom and dad and enjoying leftovers from < PROPMALE>'s Ristorante , Ceredo , WV . Life is good ! 
Scooter and Socks are still looking for ( a ) loving parent(s ) . These are two of the cutest puppies I've ever seen ( no lie ) , and if they stick around much longer , they'll simply break my heart . Also , follow me on twitter please : twitter.com/micropoetic 
Feeling a little sick today . =( 
Thank you < PROPFEMALE > Davies and Enku Ide for inviting me to the protest for the people of Libya today at the courthouse . Unfortunately I am sick . However , for anyone else who can read this and can make it to the courthouse , be there at 3:00 to support a great cause ! 
I can't make it to the forum either ? ffffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu ------ at least I have SVU on Netflix . 
found his mp3 player and is back to listening to songs even preteen girls would be embarrassed about . <3 
I'm hiding out for a little while . 
Oh well , weekend's almost here . 
I am sooooo jealous of the jazz pianist playing in the grand ballroom right now . Also , running ( walking ? jogging ? ) at the < PROPMALE > center later ! 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is parodying my poetry . I am getting so pissed . 
peggin ' my jeans and skankin ' it to half-price . <3 
The hot tub shouldn't be a shady experience , citizens of Raintree . =\\ 
So < PROPFEMALE > Griffin was as amazing as was to be expected . Also , < PROPFEMALE > Ailshire and < PROPFEMALE > Medious make great houseguests . 
Being interested in me is a precondition to being an interesting person . And what's more , I don't care if you find that arrogant .

Kickass is my alternative lifestyle . 
People should come to GSA tonight ! We can revolt if sit down/stand up doesn't last a satisfactory number of rounds ... 
Empathy for many , sympathy for few . 
I just ripped like 10 CD's in the wrong bitrate . ;_; 
So let's talk about Leibniz's ' nads for a minute . 
come to Mardi Gras Ball 2011 ! 
took in my first drag show tonight with awesome friends that I love . <3 
It's not easy retaking a Japanese test when there's a giddy conversation about Berryz ?? five feet away from you . 
adopting a Haiku ideology in lyrics , poetry , and prose has further damaged my ability to bullshit essays . wish me luck ( as if that really means anything ) on my last written exam before spring break , friends , foes , and lovers ! =( 
me : 88,000 people are missing from the Earthquake in Japan . \ 
< PROPFIRST > Howard : It doesn't concern me . 
With his venom \ 
irresistible \ 
and bittersweet \ 
that loosener \ 
of limbs , Love \ 
reptile-like \ 
strikes me down\ 
( Sappho <3 ) 
just had a very bad dream . I've definitely been watching too much SVU . However , I think the muse is back . =) 
pack the car or dance to ragtime . pack the car or dance to ragtime . 
I'm letting < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > borrow my cellphone . If you need to contact me , you can reach me through facebook . 
so I got voted off < PROPFEMALE>'s Next Top Model . :P 
\You're a lot like < PROPFIRST > Swift . \ " ~ < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > " 
So I saw this old man with a \Marriage = Man + Woman\ " bumper sticker at the Pilot station in Mt . < PROPMALE > . I promptly gave him the one-finger salute and screamed \ " FAGGOT POWER !!! \ " out the window at him ... " 
Libyan No-Fly Zone . Supermoon . Knut dying . It's too much to handle . 
Thanks to my unofficial soundbar clique ( just kidding , we're not like that ) for making this weekend memorable . Bubbly feelings of fondness . <3 
Today's goal , inspired by < PROPMALE > Cowling , is to make it through this giant pot of pasta I boiled last night . 
You can do it , < PROPFIRST > . Just put on some pants and go . 
@ the UK bookstore : I picked up a < PROPMALE > Neruda book of love poetry and almost immediately started crying . I read from Vogue and almost fell asleep . 
Please go to Ilaria Graziano's < PROPFEMALE > and listen to her new track \Crying\ " ... it's unreal . " 
because of Sappho's poetry , I now identify as Lesbian . Now on to that laundry I've been avoiding like it were a bluegrass all-star tribute to the songs of Colbie Caillat ... 
I'm not sure if I want to be a lawyer or just play one on TV . 
I dreamed last night I followed my dad and brother though a swamp ... Each stone I stepped on sank , and I was afraid of being bit/stung by the creatures in the water . They thought it was fun . =\\ 
Anyone have some good recommendations on the topic of the philosophy of < PROPMALE > ? The only book I plan on reading right now is \Intentions\ " by < PROPFIRST > Wilde . " 
Music therapy then a date with < PROPFEMALE > Novak and Totino's pizza . It's been a rough couple days . =( 
Just watched \Picnic at Hanging Rock\ " ... ._. " 
here is the L-I-Y-A-H ripping up the stage\ 
I got jazz personality , G mentality , peace to soul train\ 
So if the DJ keep on grooving , don't stop moving\ 
now let me see you go back and forth , back and forth 
but I don't want to eat five million calories , I want to exercise . #gayboyproblem 
I'm just now starting to get comfortable and articulate with writing songs about people I hate . 
I'm not bothered by GAP and the hate preachers being on campus . People need to quit ignoring the fact these radical groups exist , and that they're indoctrinating their own CHILDREN into these ideologies . These groups are manifestations of our culture's hypocrisy and ideological negligence . Exposure to it will unite and save ALL of us . 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > is on netflix ! 
Out of all the apartment buildings in Raintree , the bees chose ours to make their home ! <3 
just introduced my mommy to Descartes , Berkeley , and Hume . =)

Peer pressure wins . Getting ready for Beaux Arts right now . =) 
77° , post-beaux shower , laundry , tanning , hot tub . it's a great day , people . 
A lextran driver tried to give me a youth rate today . :| 
Should I swim down the street to get my hair cut today ?
