Vegan now ..... =) 
Hmmm am having some problem with Cafe World's catering , I can't seem to accept anyone asking for help with their catering and looks like it's just not me but my mom's too . 
That just suck big time , been a vegetarian for months and diligently not eating any kind of meat at all . Then I have a new doctor who tells me to include meat on my diet because I had a history of extreme anemia ...... \
