woke up to pee on the floor . It was cold . Not warm , not mine , not pleasant . 
Have you come here for forgiveness Have you come to raise the dead Have you come here to play Jesus To the lepers in your head

Be death not proud with final say , of whom to go and whom to stay ? What is will be and come what may , Death triumphed o'er man this day . 
\Where the devil are my slippers ? \"" 
But if it had to perish twice/I think I know enough of hate/To say that for destruction ice/Is also great/And would suffice . < PROPFIRST > Frost 
This sacrificial life/ Which men were glad to mock and spurn /Offers us the grace that law could never buy or earn . 
Bon Jovi was wrong . You CAN go home .

perpetually and woefully unprepared . 
These walls are so terribly far from soundproof ... 
Unseen pride is a brilliant fortress by all appearances . Yet on the inside , its walls could not be more treacherous . 
How lusterless dull the flicker slows/ to mock what once gave sight ! And in the cold the darkness laughs/At the gleam of hope that couldn't surpass ; That somewhere on the turning path , love lost its shine to night ! 
I see your face , a mask of paints ; a visage of kind repose/ But who , may I ask , are you my friend , when the curtains close ? 
\Not be all else to me save that thou art ... \"" 
How often is the deafening of isolation mistaken for the comfort of solitude ! 
sees a peculiar insight to the human condition through facebook . 
Crying echoes , dies , then sounds / a pleading sorrow back to You . 
What to do ? 
I didnt know what to do ... Until I remembered that < PROPFIRST > Bauer was out there somewhere ... I knew that I needed to finish watching last season ... It was all so clear to me . 
Many come in manner/That the blackest soul may be white/Senseless in and senseless out/ To end , it seems , in spite .

had a great time at dinner and ice cream ! Thanks < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Thanks for the birthday wishes ! They were very nice :) 
Alas my heart I cannot say/What sorrow I would feel/ Now turns to wrath , all burning at/ That which would refused to heal . 
They say of some temporal suffering , “No future bliss can make up for it , ” not knowing that Heaven , once attained , will work backwards and turn even that agony into a < PROPFEMALE > . CS < PROPFIRST > 
every thought captive . 
If I must hope in things unseen/Couldn't I hear a guiding sound ? / Or must I lose myself to find these signs that can't be found ? 
simplicity 
feels like posting an angry rant of how people generally do stupid things and have no idea of what is good for them , but does not have the eloquence to do so nicely . But irony abounds .... 
Played an epic game of < PROPFEMALE > pong .... But alas , I did not find victory , but the bitterness of defeat . Still , it was awesome . I feel something like < PROPMALE > felt on Degobah after Yoda tells him , \Unfortunate that you rushed to face him ... that incomplete was your training . Not ready for the burden were you . \"" 
tasty beverages 
Spring Camp was great . I miss it . 
And the earth spins/while his world stands still . /His words driving nails/in the man on the hill . /Oh < PROPFIRST > you're not alone/your words were like mine/Swim back to the hope , now/your peace comes in time .

What should be included in the ye t-t o-be written Super Hero Creed ? 
Sometimes belief is accepting the only available option .

Where does the misunderstanding come from ?

gotta love Icarus ... 
Humans Versus Zombies tomorrow ... I am stoked . 
Day One : Leave it to me to sleep past my alarm clock on the first day of a Zombie apocalypse ... 12 zombies at the start ... now in less than twenty four hours , their < PROPFIRST > have almost multiplied 10 times over . It is Day 2 , and I am a survivor ... thus far . 
Day Two : Made it through the day without incident . Strength in < PROPFIRST > is a must . Lucky for us humans , Zombies are relatively brainless and rather dull . But unfortunately , our best access road is no longer available . Looks like Day Three is going to be a shot in the dark ... 
Day Three : Holed up in the Communications Facility , with no cell phone service . But if that irony weren't enough , it looks like zombies are trying to trap us six ways to Sunday . It will be a miracle to make it out of this death-trap ... 
Day Three : The sun has disappeared into the cold blackness of night . Made it safely back to HQ . Cheated death once . We may not get that lucky again . But rumors are floating around that the Zombie Apocalypse may be coming to an end ... Survival isn't just a distant hope anymore ... 
What is the heart of the Gospel ?

So my dad beat my score on the Wii Fit for Slalom . It involves balancing . He has a broken leg and he still beat me . What the heck ??? 
Good work to all those who were baptized today . It was quite awesome .
