He who fights with monsters might take care lest he thereby become a monster . And if you gaze for long into an abyss , the abyss gazes also into you . 
Thats worse than the water < PROPFEMALE > . 
what ever you are doing or thinking , stop for a second and remember ................... 
live fast and die young 
I must not fear . Fear is the mind-killer . Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration . I will face my fear . I will permit it to pass over me and through me . And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path . Where the fear has gone there will be nothing . Only I will remain .

Don’t be afraid of death ;\

Battle not with monsters , lest ye become a monster , and if you gaze into the abyss , the abyss gazes also into you . \
