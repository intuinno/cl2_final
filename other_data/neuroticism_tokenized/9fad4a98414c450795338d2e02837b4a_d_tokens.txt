Hahah , my pictures upside down . that's uncool 
I'ma miss my little Niece 
oh well wasn't that an eventful day :/ 
I am the gummy bear < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > is my < PROPFEMALE > . :p ( No , I'm not Marrying her ) 
Can't wait till my Tilly dearest comes to visit . 
Welcome to 2011 . Lets hope for the best in this new year . 
Love is friendship set on fire . 
I'm pretty sure if anyone could read mine and mikaylas minds they'd be scared . OH and this new year has gotten off to an amazing start . Now I Know that this is going to be an amazing year . 
I dislike facebook . It's lame . 
Coooooooooooooooooooooooooooooww 
To often we underestimate the power of a touch , a smile , a kind word , a listening ear , an honest compliment , or the smallest act of caring . All of which have the potential to turn life around . So take everything in the best way you can . Don't turn down the ones you love for the ones you want . Because sometimes we just don't get what we want . But , we'll always want what we can't have . 
So bored with school . Its like nothing ever happens here anymore . What a bummer . 
Ready for school to end . Theres only about 20 days left . so Its okay but , the weather needs to warm up . and fast . 
I kind of want to do online school full time . for next year . Do you think that would be a good idea ? 
It's almost been a year since I'v lived in Utah . :/ 
Be everything you've ever dreamed of . be the person you want to see . Be yourself above all other things . 
Nine more days left of school . seriously , I can't wait for summer . It's going to be great . Except for the fact that i'll be in Utah . I use to love going on vacation then going back to Oregon . 
The kids at my school are like scared little animal . As if their scared to be themselves . Ever wonder why they don't talk to me ? Well there you go . 
Today has been a really good day so far . Lets hope it stays that way . (: 
Where i'm at right now , I don't have tolerance for something stupid , or hatred , or envy . If your bringing anyone of those things how ' bout you leave me alone . 
Do I really look that old ? I just got asked if I was a senior . 
I have learned to ALWAYS make sure I'm logged out of facebook on my mom's computer before I leave . Or else she posts random stuff on people status . Thanks a lot mom . Xp 
I wanna travel with the circus one day ! \ 
That'd be so cool . Can you imagine it ? 
Having fun isn't hard when you got a library card ! -Arthur(pbs ) 
Dear teacher : Im not going to clean your classroom . Thats your job . 
What do you know . I did get a yearbook . Neat . c : 
Finally , it's summer . Out of school and it's actually warm outside . 
I think I'll go for a run . It's like the perfect weather . (: 
Not Fair > : C 
I hate my hair . It needs to be fixed NOW . >:/ 
Pretty smiles and make-up hide so much these days . 
I can't believe I just went though face book and \liked\ " all this random stuff because I have nothing better to do . X ) " 
I think it's time to go eat some waffles . Yummm . (: 
Mom- Eventually you will read this , I want a camcorder so that I can record my life . Because that would be so neat . But , I'm probably going to tell you this when I see you tomorrow . So this was just pointless . 
I love looking at old photo's of when everyone was little . It really makes you miss the old days though . 
So today , I was calld by Hot Topic and offered an interveiw . But the problem is that im going to be gone most of the summer . They're looking for summer help . Hopfully i'll get another interveiw either from there or somewhere else later in the year . 
singing to the radio and driving yhrougb the coutry is the best . I want to get a baby black sheep and put a bow around its neck . c : 
going to the zoo today with mikayla , Jayce , < PROPFIRST > and maybe autumn . whoooo ! (: 
driving back to Utah today . but only 18 more days till I can come back to Oregon . 
Well I Cleaned my whole room today . But , now I'm really hungry and theres nothing in this house I want to eat . It's all junk food ; kind of . 
\There are few who see with their own eyes and feel with their own hearts . \ " - < PROPFIRST > Einstein " 
\A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new . \ " -Einstein " 
Thank you aunt < PROPFEMALE > for driving me to Hillsboro . 
Been thinking of taking out my snake bites(lip piercings ) . 
Going to the zoo the Zoooooo Tomorroowww with Autumn and Mikayla ! Whoohoo ! 
Just watched a guy walk down the middle of the highway . The police showed up and beat the guy up . The guy looked pretty out of it . That just made my day . haha 
Took out half my extensions last night because they were falling out ... might take out the rest when I get back to Utah . Next time I'm going with clip-ins . 
Gonna make some cookies with Mikayla and see the movie \Grown Ups\ " tonight . (: " 
I feel the need to draw or color or paint ... now where is a pencil . 
I cannot believe that I signed up for a ' Twitter ' today because I had nothing better to do . How sad . 
Took out my extensions tonight , so I'm back to ' shortish ' hair . I will not do though's kind of extensions again . And Mikayla keeps making fun of how I type ! 
My touch screen on my phone is not working at all . All I can do is call my house phone and thats it . I need to get it fixed but , I have no way to get to the AT&T store . 
Getting ready to go camping . It's so cute how excited < PROPFEMALE > is . No phone till Tuesday though . 
Oooh , my moms going to hate that I found great extensions to buy from < PROPFEMALE>'s beauty . 
Thanks to Mikayla and her momma I got my replacement phone . Although now I need everyones number again . 
Some how just got mouthwash up my nose . Trust me , It hurts . >.< 
< PROPFEMALE>'s next top model is my favorite . <3 
Officially took out my lip piercings . It's time for a change . 
If It was possible , I would live in the clouds . 
\Pretty smiles and make-up hide so much these days . \"" 
Finally getting to that online school I've been putting off for no reason . Can't finish my drivers < PROPMALE > class yet though . Stupid test won't let me move past the first question . 
Uhm , windows live messenger . Just signed up for it . MaleiaRainbow@hotmail.com 
I actually want to do my homework now . Has the world turned around ? I think not , looks like it's just me . 
I've decided that < PROPMALE > will go see Step Up 3 with me weather he likes it or not . 
It scares me when people say they want to kill themselves . 
All true learning is experience . Everything else is just information . 
In portland with < PROPFEMALE > ! 
My tummy still hurts for some reason . hmmm . 
Theres a spider in here ! D: 
Can't wait to see < PROPFEMALE > tomorrow . (: 
Can't wait to get a haircut next week . (: 
I am getting my hair cut today . (: 
Your on your own now believe me . 
say hello to co captain < PROPMALE > (: 
So close to finishing my east shore packet for Bio . And Im not feeling well . On another note , first day of school as a < PROPMALE > was good . (: 
School is SO tiring . And I already have homework . \ 
Boy oh boy , this will be fun . 
I run with polar bears 
< PROPFIRST > Cullen is a fictional character and h will never love you . Sorry < PROPFEMALE > . X ) 
They're suppose to tell you when picture day is . >:/ 
The Gym is SO freezing ! 
It's always a good idea to take a nap when your having a rough day . 
Road Test this week ! \ 
Actually known as tomorrow morning ! 
They say that the people who don't say much are the most interesting . I have found that to be true . 
People in Utah dress their children very oddly . Reminds me of thing girl I knew in Oregon . oh , my ! 
Thank you Kyrsten . 
Why do we have eyebrows ? 
Driving test put off again . Why can't people ever just help me out . I guess this means more driving time . So close to making an appointment with the DMV though . 
I want to go to beddd ... \ 
So sleepy . 
I hate when people use the word ' fracking ' . It's so irritating and sounds idiotic . 
I don't understand the whole ' I'm best friends with my teacher ' concept and the ' I text my teacher everyday . ' It's just so odd to me . We never had kids like that in Oregon . 
I think this is the earliest ive ever been up on a saturday . 
I'd appreciate if I would stop being told to look and be someone else . Because fact of the matter is that I don't look the same as I did in 7th grade and I'm not the same person . I love the way I look and I'm more confident . If you don't like it then I don't think we can be friends . 
I PASSED MY ROAD TEST ! 
yessss , long lunch today . Im SO tired . 
To my two daughters < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > and Kyrsten < PROPFEMALE > , I love you two sweet dreams ! 
Facebook thinks it knows me .... ' you're moderately talkative , outgoing , social&interacting . you're very relaxed , calm , secure&optimistic . you're at times , overly flexible , improvised&fun seeking at the expense of reliability , work ethic , and long term accomplishment . you're at times overly kind natured , trusting&helpful . you'e extremely intellectual , curious , imaginative but possibly not very practical . ' 
Mmm , I love Autumn Skie < PROPMALE > . (: 
The song ' American Boy ' is stuck in my head . where did it come from ?! 
Asians can teleport . 
Mmm I kinda want to make more cupcakes but , yesterdays didnt go so well . I swear it was the ghost in the freezer who cuursed them . 
Makanda . haha (: 
Mmm , Dance class tonight . \ 
East shore tomorrow with Kyrsten . \ 
Thursday ...? \ 
Friday < PROPFEMALE>'s Birthday Party . \ 
Good week happening ... yes . (: 
Homework \Party\ " With Kyrsten and < PROPFEMALE > instead of east shore . mmmm . (: " 
Gonna cut Amandas hair today . whooo ! (: 
It takes disaster to learn a lesson . We're gonna make it through the darkest nights . Some people betray one and cause treason . We're gonna make everything alright . The worst of times now , they don't faze me . Even if I look and act really crazy . 
So I was watching the news and apparently some LDS guy said that gay marriage is wrong . well you know what ; I support gays . 
No mom , don't comment on my picture and say \yuck\ " : 0 " 
yoga is the best when you do it in p.e 
So , I was in such a good moood today . Now it's gone . 
Autumn : \You have pretty legs . \ " \ 
I know what I want for my birthday now . \ 
Even though I know I probably won't get it . \ 
(: 
I'm over obsessive with my hair .... perfectionist ? Yes . 
\Just do it\ " \ 
Cheese sammich . Imma make one . 
I wonder why they don't make grape srarbursts . probably because grape os disgusting . 
Degrassi is dramatic . But so interesting ! 
I love Donkey Kong . <3 
Dear Mom , I think I need a spiderman shirt . The End . 
Level of stupidity reached . I just stepped on my straightner and then accidentaly smashed my finger . Good morning ? I don't think so . 
< PROPFEMALE>'s birthday is tomorrow . The big 16 . Gonna make it fun for her . yeah ? (: 
From some random person on formspring : \You are a twit and an idiot\ " \ 
gonna work real hard and get this project done by 11pm . 
Goal-failed-my mom laughed at me because I'm not even half way done . 
I think all kitties should have wings ; Like dragons . 
watching adventure time with Finn and < PROPMALE > ! Best show ever . Do you like that showw ? 
Do all guys love < PROPFEMALE > wars ? 
Happy birthday Autumn Skie < PROPMALE > . <3 
I love totinos pizza rolls . I wish I had some . 
Panda poured pixi stick down my shirt ! 
Huh , didn't really expect that . 
\Modern Family\ " Is now one of my favorite shows . hah . " 
I remember that day so well ... (: 
The kkk took my baby away . Oh wait nooo , < PROPFEMALE > did ! 
Dallin read me a story before I went to bed last night . ahaha . :p 
Dear , Teren Rudd my friends are delicious . 
I finally cleaned my room . Thats shocking . hah . 
I believe in dragons , good men , and other fantasy creatures . I love driving behind people with bumper stickers . 
Mikayla < PROPMALE > And I are going to get some amazing hats during summer time . 
I want a BMW 3 series 
1 4 3 I la la love you . Kyrsten < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > York , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Kinder <3 
It's official ; I want a 1994 Suzuki Sidekick . (: 
Boys like girls ... No ... not all boys . 
We have totinos pizza rolls ! This day just got better . 
Simpsons tree house of horror XX is FINALLY showing . Dallin and I have been waiting forever to see it . 
Everything in this room is edible . Even I am edible but , that is called cannibalism . and is looked down upon in most modern society's . but not in my modern society . 
Maybe i'll just sleep all day and become a night owl . 
Can I just say this :\ 
1- I liked movie day . \ 
2- I still can't find my Ipod . \ 
3- I made some pretty great < PROPMALE > n ' cheese . 
I want a puppy really badly . And < PROPFIRST > Lavish York is the best . <3 
I declare that today will be a lazy day . And gonna paint my nails white with blue stripes like white tigers . <3 
I'm so proud of myself for finally washing my clothes . <3 
A teenage bride with a baby inside getting high on information . 
This explains so much why I never come home after school . 
< PROPFIRST > Lavish York , Kyrsten < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Kinder , < PROPMALE > Smith , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Valenzuela , and < PROPFEMALE > Hansen I loooove you . <3

Going to < PROPFIRST>'s soon ! :D FOOOOD . 
It's weird to think that my birthday is in exactly one week . 
I taste blood in my mouth . Cause I bit my tonge . >.< 
Had an amazing weekend and few days of this week thanks to < PROPFIRST > and Panda . <3 Tomorrow off to Oregon . Talking to Mikayla and somehow she got some legit knowledge on things . SHARE . 
My hands smell like Burger < PROPMALE > soap . < PROPFEMALE > was right ... Foamy soap is EVERYWHERE . The world just got better . 
< PROPFEMALE > . Cold . Driving to grammy's house today . Lost one of my bracelets . And tiired . This should be a good day though . 
That pie was gross . Lets not ever make it again . >_< And its hot in hear . But Im playing a game . Scatigoriys is difficult . 
I guess I should say this but , it just seems so clesha . Happy Thanksgiving everyone . I hope you had an amazing day . <3 
You're like the boy who cried wolf . I don't believe a word you say . Sorry . 
< PROPFEMALE > stole my ' friend ' and I dropped my phone in my milk ... Ewww . >_< 
Headache Headache go away dont come back another day . I dont like you and I dont care . why dont you just get out of here . 
I'm glad I can finally look back at you and honestly think \what was I thinking\ " and laugh while thinking it . " 
I'm content with where i'm at . Happy with who i've met and grateful for what I have . What could be better ? 
' Oregon thanks you for visiting , come again soon ' Don't worry Oregon I will . ' Welcome to Idaho ' well thanks Idaho . 
Just got home . And might see Tilly(Nicole ) tomorrow . * fingers crossed * 
I want to thank everyone for the birthday wishes . I appreciate it . (: 
Ridiculous drama will never be solved if you never face it . I just hope you know . So put on your big girl panties AND TALK . 
Take it to the fridge ! Chocolate caaaaake . You see these shackels baby im your slaaaave . 
Hhah . wow . I'm done with this . It keeps coming back around . But no . I'm locking it in a closet . Now to get my mind off it . I guess I'll do some homework . Yes mom , I'm actually going to do homework . 
' Make-up and pretty smiles hide so much these days . ' 
Dallin- \where did you get that pie ? \ " \ 
Wait to the fact you did it and won't admit it . Won't make you innocent . 
The truth hurts . Didn't ya ' know ? But , at least I'm honest . 
Im so sick of it , you're attention deficaite . Never listen . Never listen . 
It's not playing innocent . It's called not being at fault . 
And this is why I never wake up before two in the afternoon on nonschool days . There's nothing to do . 
It's going to be a good day . (: 
Mikayla < PROPMALE > and I basically lead the same lives . Proof that we are twins . Yes . 
The doctors diagnosed me with creasent mooon face . 
That was pretty funny . 
It's called growing up and being independant . Lets make a goal to get a job . YES . 
Woke up from a 5 hour nap to the most amazing show in the world . ADVENTURE TIME ! 
Panda and I have the best friendship song . (: 
Dallin says : ' Dude , that chick from Icarly looks like a monkey . ' 
I'd walk through hell for you , let it burn right through my shoes . \ 
These soles are useless without you . 
The house is slightly askew ! To the panic room ! 
I . Am . So . Bored . \ 
I can't watch the simpsons forever . Haha . 
I'm pretty sure lysol wipes are good for the soul . c : 
Hmmm , Im thinking of dying my hair . But not unnatural color ... something that'll stay . Ideas ? 
I finally get to make french toast ! :D 
you are like a sunset to me . \ 
You're all kinds of beautiful as you end my day . \ 
And you sweetly retire as stars < PROPMALE > you away 
Not being able to do anything all day leads to doing a bunch of math homework , making french toast that leads to french toast talk . In the end leads to pretty cool looking pictures and taking a bath with clothes on . hahahahah 
My totinos pizza rolls are unthawed and now brought to life . First thing they hear from me is ' please dont be ugly ' . I'm pretty sure some americans say t 
OhMy , I think it's shower time ! 
Fall in love or fall in hate , Get inspired or be depressed . Ace a test or flunk a class , Make babies or make < PROPMALE > . Speak the truth or lie and cheat . Dance on tables or sit in the corner . Life is divine chaos . Embrace it . Forgive yourself . Breathe . And enjoy the ride . 
This hardly makes me want to come home . It's not even fair . If I could just not live here . I would .

Finally going christmas shopping ... with my daddy . (: 
I LOVE telling mikayla about my wisdom teeth . Just because it grosses her out so much . XD 
awww sad . < PROPMALE > thinks im a retard . XD\ 
Just proves he never deserved cake . 
Well since dallin woke me up Im making < PROPMALE > pancakes . Haha . No pancakes for him ! 
Sitting next to Teren in the car . Eating < PROPMALE > pancakes . While he says this huge long speech saying like everyother word . Hahaha 
My tummy hurts . :/ 
Don't take life to seriously , nobody gets out alive anyway . 
Being happy doesn't mean that everything is perfect . It means that you've decided to look beyond the imperfection . 
Maleia isn't a happy camper . Getting her wisdom teeth out in about two hours . Her head hurts and to top it all off her ankel still is in pain . No wonder that fat cat never liked Mondays . 
Have no idea how I got home . Feel like im seeing double . Falling asleep in odd places because it's hard to get up and walk . On the plus side the pain meds havent worn off . 
Live the life you want to live . \ 
Be the person you want to remember . \ 
Make decisions . \ 
Make mistakes . \ 
And if you fall ; at least you tried . 
I took a nap . and woke up to realize my cheeks are bigger than when I fell asleep . 
So I was in the car today with my mom drinking a smoothie . When she went into the post office I was looking at text messages from last night I sent . Lets just say , I should not text when I'm on loartab again . X ) 
There is no such word as loved . Love has no past tense . If you ever stop loving someone , then you never truly loved them in the first place . 
My mouth hurts so bad that I can't sleep . 
I've got some friends , some that I hardly know . \ 
But we've had some times , I wouldn't trade for the world . \ 
We < PROPMALE > these days down with talks of the places that we will go . 
November20th2010 is a day I'll never regret the choices I made . (: 
I'm more than sure that I hate this day . 
I've been talking on the phone with < PROPMALE > Oveson for 4 hours 9 minutes and 36 seconds . What an accomplishment . :p 
I don't care if tomorrow is school . Lets just get today over and done with . 
Stand for something or you'll fall for anything . 
There are three people I could never bare to lose . Panda PopTart , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > York and my dear twin Mikayla < PROPMALE > . <3 They're all sorts of amazing . 
One hour of traffic school down . Two more to go till I get my completion paper . Also , Final Destination marathon to be continued tomorrow at Panda PopTart's house . (: 
Go play in traffic . ;D 
this is maleias utah bestie i love this girl ! she is amazing ! and she is my world ! love panda => 
I couldn't be happier . (: 
Talk about your bad dreams ... 
\Sticks and stones may brake her bones but names could make her starve herself to death . \"" 
I think that I may be coming down with a fever ... yet I put myself next to all these chemicals because I feel like cleaning . Also , I refuse to go to sleep . I don't want a repeat of last night . 
To wish you were someone else is to waste the person you are . 
So i've realized a couple things tonight . 1-peppers were an awful invention . 2-David costa is entertaing . 3-I couldn't be happier with my life . (: 
\There are things in this world\ 
If theres one thing I've learned , it's that we don't feel the heat until we get burned . 
I'm made of wax , < PROPFIRST > , what are you made of ? 
I think everything is just funnier in my mind . And in my mind-nothing goes wrong . ;D 
To the world you're just one person but , to one person you could mean the world- 2MonthsToday . <3 
If your Mom is or was your hero , your best friend , or just the best Mom ever , if you are blessed to still have your Mom or if she is an angel in heaven , paste this to your status and let everyone know you are proud of your Mom , and that you love her dearly . You can replace a lot of people in life , but you only have one Mom ?? 
What you do speaks so loud that I cannot hear what you say . 
I find it disturbing when girls say they want to marry < PROPFEMALE > Bieber . It's not right that they want to marry a 12 year old girl . 
The things that I see in my room no longer are the size of spiders . They're getting bigger as the days go by . Am I going crazy ? D: 
Today should be a good day-But im so tired . And I have to go to school in tje morning even though my class is after lunch . This is why my car needs to be fixed already .. -____- 
The greatest thing you'll ever learn to to love and be loved in return . 
You should never try to change me . I can be nobody else-And I like the way I am . (: 
AHAHAHAHA-Panda tripped on the stairs ! That takes talent . ;D \ 
ps-A troll in central park is such a cute movie . <3 
It's like an event in this house-When one person needs to pee than everyone needs to pee . :o 
Me : ' My toe is cold . ' \ 
Panda : ' Cover them up . ' \ 
Me : ' They are . :o ' \ 
Panda : ' Where is < PROPFIRST > to sit on them . ' \ 
Me : ' I dont want < PROPFIRST > s butt on my feets . ' \ 
Panda : ' So , I had < PROPFIRST > on my butt . ' \ 
Me : * outbursts laughter * 
Making some brownies with Dr. Teren Rudd and drinking kool-aide . Mmm . ;D 
TEREN'S A GUMMY BEAR JACKER . Jokes on him they're all sticky from when I was eating them in the shower . 
Lets just say that there are some people in this world that shouldnt have children ... Other than that goood day . SO tried and have no idea how ik getting home . haha 
Spending another night at pandabears house . Should be fun .... tomorrow ... right now it's going to be sleepy time . (: 
Well hello there space cadet welcome back down to earth . 
I never want to come back to this school again . I don't need the looks and the judgement . I just want to finish school already and move on with my life . Take the people with me who are good for my life and leave everyone else behind . 
Four years ago today I was blessed to be the aunt of < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Rudd . She is a remarkable little girl and I'd do anything for her . I love her with all of my heart . And I know she is being raised right because she is the daughter of my sister . Happy birthday < PROPFEMALE > . <3 
I'm really white-I know this because i've lived the life of snow . 
I introduced myself to a Sobe today- ' charmed i'm sure . ' Is all it could tell me . 
How about you just-Marry me ? (: 
Oh . okay . wow . That would happen . I'm having some bad luck today . 
I don't know what i'd do without my twin . MikaylaMurry , you're one amazing girl . (:

You aren't the only one in this so show a little care and concern . 
I'm allowed to have an opinion , eye and mind . But all you want to do is take that away . I am a human being with feelings and thoughts . All you want to do is hide them away . Step away from the fire-you might get burned . 
I was always taught to use my ' I ' words . So lets give it a shot- I don't care . 
Are you ready for war ? Because it's coming . And I'm not afraid . (: 
The wolfie clan is strong . Autumn < PROPMALE > , Mikayla < PROPMALE > and our newest member < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > York . 
Tell me something-what are we even fighting for ? It's only going one way and it needs to stop . Let me tell what I know to be true . I know thats just as possible as going to wonderland . 
I believe that I am losing what I've gained . Scratch that-I have lost what I gained . But when this happens there will always be one thing that will bring you back up to the top in the worst of times . We have to be grateful for every success and mistake . The world is a messed up place . Bringing negativity will only bring fatality . So , we must stay positive to save ourselves .

I know you to well for my own good . So well I could guess your next move and put the next three on paper for your eyes to see . 
This world is full of agony and shame . \ 
Shame for who we are , what we've done and where we are in life . \ 
But , what we keep forgetting is that life is full of mistakes . \ 
It's better to embrace them rather than regret . 
Writing a persuasive speech about why Nirvana is better than The Smashing Pumpkins and also writig an expository speech on Fallen Angels . I have to present these both on the same day one after another to the instructor at East Shore . \ 
-____- 
If I had one wish it would be to go back in time and see Nirvana perform live . I wish I could have been lucky enough to meet < PROPMALE > Cobain . But if I did meet < PROPMALE > Cobain would my point of view on him change ? 
I'm just going to say this : Writng about fallen angels is the best subject I've ever chosen . So interesting . (: 
It's amusing to watch how easily people judge when they don't even know the situation . 
I'm not telling you how to live your life so please stay far away from mine .

It was worth the drive . I guess I'm going again tomorrow . Not sure if I really want to though . Like I do but I don't . Ya ' know ? 
So uhhhh-I made these AMAZING noddles and they're all gone . I could have sworn I had more . :o 
Teren just farted in my room ! \ 
Me : Did you just fart in my room ? \ 
Teren : No I didn't . The cheese made a weird noise . \ 
Me : YOU FARTED ! XD\ 
Teren : I'm eating cheese what do you expect ? \ 
Me : So you admit you farted . :o 
I say that since Mikayla < PROPMALE > wasn't able to come down to Utah for her spring break then she should come down during summer for some twinly adventures . c : 
Had to take Andee to the vet and pet-co today to see if she had any chips . I feel just awfully sick . But at least she had fun and met some new friends . 
We are who we are for a lot of reasons and maybe we'll never know most of them . Even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from . We can still choose where we go from there . 
\I am enough of an artist to draw freely upon my imagination . Imagination is more important than knowledge . Knowledge is limited . Imagination encircles the world . \ " \ 
I swear Tetris is trying to screw me over . I was doing great and then it's all ' Oh no you don't gurlfreennn!' 
My room no longer smells like burnt plastic-I can finally go to bed without that awful smell ! :D 
I won't be your prey . \ 
You're a wooden puppet on a string and you think your clever . \ 
Boldfaced lies control everything in you . 
\You never fail until you stop trying . \ " \ 
\I object to violence because when it appears to do good
