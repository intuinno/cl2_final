I have yet to see any problem , however complicated , which , when you looked at it in the right way , did not become still more complicated . 
I HATE idiots that complain about an argument they started , and then when you point that fact at them , they turn around and try to push blame onto you , while sounding like a total jackass in the process . And yet they are 100% sure that they are right , and you are the idiot 
Day off of school =D ouble Decker sandwich and video games . I hate the doctor though ... he tells me to lose weight , and yet has 4 or 5 chins
