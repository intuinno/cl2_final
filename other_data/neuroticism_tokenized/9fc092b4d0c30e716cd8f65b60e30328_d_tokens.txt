\ < Tokyo-Angel > bummed-out : I think you're the straightest one in this room . < bummed-out > Tokyo-Angel : I am super straight . < bummed-out > Tokyo-Angel : I am like the trajectory of a 9 year old who has been sucker punched by Mr. T . \ " OH MY GOD I AM LAUGHING SO HARD WHY . " 

My Abuela just threatened to punch me in the face ' cause I took the cell D: 
must be really bored to actually be on here ... 
is at her mom's work , on a YMCA computer . I am deeply disturbed by the slowness and lack of a scroll button on the mouse > : c 
thinks everyone is displeased today , or at least seems like it . I'm almost done with World History though c : 
is hoooooome and doesn't like it > : c 
feels like crap and can give absolutely no explanation as to why , but it's probably the Bipolar Disorder talking . 
still kinda feels like crap . Going to Mom's work will make it better though c : 
HAS ARRIVED c : . I like it better at my Mom's work for some reason ... it's entertaining , and I feel less crappy . Not too much , but a bit less than earlier . 
is alive , she just has no internet at home .. and the YMCA is closed on Weekends because they faaaaaail like that .. -tired- 
wonders why she feels like she's in a hospital ... 
< PROPFEMALE > got a new laptop > : c . I could've gotten one , but I decided to save my money for some reason . Oh well , at least I can borrow it while my internet is out . So , I'M ALIVE , for the most part xD 
has her own internet now ~ 
misses people D: 
felt like shit , and still felt like shit , but at least now I feel slightly better because of someone , no thanks to another . 
saw Mama at Freddies ! And cried quite a bit . In the middle of the store . But yay c : 
is confused and ' wtf'ing : c . I think too much . 
neeeeeds a PSP at some point : c . I WANNA GET BIRTH BY SLEEP ! 
wants to talk to someone . Unfortunately , the only person I can really talk to is asleep and refusing to get up although she said she would >_> . She'll see this later ... oh well . I hate thinking . I really do . Even if I'm not really thinking of anything , something's always gonna fucking bother me . 
is OMNOMNOMING and did totally not just forget about taking her meds , nope .. And I'm definitely not yelling at < PROPFIRST > Party 3 again , nope >_> 
HAPPY HALLOWEEN YA MOTHERS > : 0 
is somewhat irritated , but at least I can finally draw , even if it fails . 
is surprised she can draw a rather complicated family tree , and be able to understand it easily ... anyone else would probably flip their shit . And DAMMIT SAI FOR GETTING THIS SONG STUCK IN MY HEAD . Damn ' Let It Rock ' >_> 
is bein ' sexy > : 0 . Not really , but I can dream c : 
' s internet is working properly now , YAY c : 
wants to think , but doesn't want to think of certain other things .. and she's bored . GO ME . 
tries to think of a new Yahoo ! ID , contemplating certain things ... and being in a somewhat apathetic mood , I suppose . That'll change pretty quickly though , I'm sure . 
has 16 days until her birthday c : 
has 15 days until her birthday now , and is spontaneously interested in Neurotically Yours once again ~ 
turns 17 in TEN DAYS . TEN . I'm actually not that excited , it'd just fun to shout out how many days left until then cause I'm odd . 
is listening to Tiffy singing in my ear ~ 
has her birthday in SIX DAYS c : 
contemplates going on a walk to the store , even though it's 10 degrees outside ... I think I'll brave it . 
is trying not to think , but at least my birthday is in 4 days . 
got her hopes up . It didn't end that well . 
doesn't want to do much of anything at the moment . 
apparently likes to make a plethora of useless status messages that no one will really care about . For reasons I can hardly fucking remember why , I feel terrible . I kind of remember , but not really . That makes it worse . But off to brave the not-so-cold weather , try not to cry again , and avoid crashing on my emotional rollercoaster . 
And then , after a few minutes , am a bit better . Fuck moodswings , and I shouldn't be allowed on here xD ; 
Thanksgiving is tomorrow , then Friday's my birthday . Woo > : 0 ! 
My sister is a fucking idiot . 
Happy Thanksgiving c : 
is now 17 ~ 
Being 17 isn't that great either , but at least some people cared about yesterday . 
is oblivious and anxious , apparently .

Happy New Year's < PROPFEMALE > , though I'm not exactly excited about it either xD 
Yes , lets all get drunk and fire fireworks and such in a wooded area , then aim smaller ones at power lines , underneath cars and MY HOUSE , then leave shit in the road to get run over and have my Mom take too long for my < PROPFEMALE > to slow down so the people can get it . I thought they were kids . Now I'm irritated , but fine . 
New Year's < PROPFEMALE > is like St. < PROPFIRST>'s Day . It's just another excuse to drink and party , except nobody knows what St. < PROPFIRST>'s Day is for . 
Happy New Year 
I lost the game DAMMIT < PROPFIRST > IT'S ALL YOU'RE FAULT .

- My wrist brace is officially named the Love Glove > : 0 . Because it's so damn comfortable I fell asleep wearing it . Why do I have a wrist brace , you ask ? I really needed one . I figured I had it for a while , but it's so obvious I have carpal tunnel it's not even funny . 
So , I think a few can agree that this week has pretty much been so miserable that it fails almost on an epic scale . 
My mind is a paradox . Like a boss . 
CALL 1-800-GETPICE FOR ALL OF YOUR TELEMARKETED INDIAN SEXUAL NEEDS TODAY ! 
I don't really know what to think today .. last week , I thought way too much . Now I think too little , or can't exactly think about anything at all . I don't know how I should feel towards certain things . It's complicated . Sunday has cursed my Monday , making it worse . I hate Mondays xD 
\Today I realized a Hershey's Kiss is a giant chocolate chip . MLIA \ " HOLY MOTHER OF GOD IT IS D: ! " 
Fffff today doesn't feel like a good day for some reason .. 
doesn't FEEL amazing , but is amazing nonetheless . I sound full of myself , but I JUST THOUGHT EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW . 
Oh son of a motherless goat > : c 
AND SO , MY GAMECUBE HAS RISEN FROM THE DEAD . Our family is MAGIC apparently .. but my Animal Crossing character looks RETARDED : c ... oh wait , then it's an accurate representation of myself lawl 
wants to go back to sleep , but can't . Boo . 
Do I REALLY seem like the type of person who'd attempt snorting a pixie stick ? REALLY ? THANKS . 
is still having sleeping problems and is currently sore as hell . What the fuck , 2010 ? What do you have against me ? Goodness .. 
CURSE YOU SIMS 2 AND YOU BEING FUCKIN ' RETARDED > : 0 . AGE MY SIMS DAMN YOU ! 
is randomly a little hyper .. how odd o_o . If it wasn't 5AM I'd probably be laughing maniacally right about now ... BUT THAT'S WHY YOU ALL LOVE ME =D 
IT'S GIGGLE FIT TIME ! Teeeeehee x3

is amazed the little wireless connection available on the laptop works . TO THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN WONDERING WHERE I WANT , which is not many people , and idk who would care , I haven't had internet since January 22nd . Miss < PROPFEMALE > Blue's birthday is bad luck > : c . But I'm getting internet back on my own computer on Monday hopefully ! 
has FINALLY OBTAINED INTERNET . Yay c : 
isn't as interested in Facebook(more specifically , the games)(Aw fuck I lost the game ) anymore . I'm actually bored enough to go on here now , but damn I'm tired D: 
finds it greatly amusing when it looks like birds are crashing into her roof or window , especially when they actually are . GOOD MORNING TO YOU TOO , BIRDS . 
can't stop listening to ' Bad Romance ' . What the fuck . I BLAME YOU , MISS < PROPFEMALE > BLUE > : c ! And now I want to dance D: ! OTL 
has some fuckin ' issues she needs to work out in the next few hours before she BURSTS AND ALL HELL IS LET LOOSE AND OH MY FUCKING LORD ASJFHASFJAS ! -raaaage- 
< PROPFEMALE > , I'm good now . Lady GaGa's bad for your health , man . That shit was horrible ... but now my wrist hurts . Oh boo : c 
has finally decided to check her Facebook , and doesn't exactly have much to say . Not much to report . Trickster Online is still fuckin ' AMAZING , but other than that I've got nothin ' going on in life except for common bad moods and random irritations with people . I just shouldn't come on here at all o_o . BAZINGA ? 
I need a new profile picture ... I should draw one . 
is totally not singing to ' Faith ' . Nope . 
thinks < PROPFEMALE > just tried to digivolve and failed miserably ... 
just noticed that everyone in our house tends to call < PROPFEMALE > ' the < PROPFEMALE>' or ' the other one ' ... LAWL 
Ffffffffffffffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuu -- 
Fuck you , < PROPFIRST > , and your unnecessary use of CYAN > : c ! But it's TOO LATE D: . My retinaaas !

I love youuu ~ 
misses her darlin's : c 
So < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > are ALMOST officially gone to stay with < PROPMALE > for the summer . It's a little bit of a relief I suppose , but I feel bad for the fact that it's HIM . < PROPFEMALE > was crying her damn eyes out until she got into the car , and still is , man . So basically she'd been crying for 2 hours or more . She almost had me cryin ' too , man . That shit ain't coo ' > : 0 . 
found half of a bike on the way home from the store . No handlebars , seat , chain , or wheels . Just the remaining part . I don't remember if it had pedals or not either . Wtf , man . 
God dammit , Mom . It's like our taste in music is hereditary . A combination of amazing , random ass shit . Now I reeeeally want to listen to < PROPFEMALE > D: 
Thinking of a username for twitter is hard when TinaTina is already fuckin ' takin > : c . I'm trying to resist using SemeSquad or anything . Damn you < PROPFIRST > . 
has some grape drank > : 0 
is going to manage to steal Mommy's computer EVERY DAY so I can watch all four books of avatar > : 0 
GUYS . THEY MADE A DRAWN TOGETHER MOVIE , and thanks to the amazing friend who gives us pirated shit , I OWN IT . 
STOP GETTING AAs IN DDR EVERY 5 MINUTES , < PROPFIRST > , YOU WHORE . MY LOVE FOR YOU IS /DYING/ D: 
I'm under the strong impression that < PROPFIRST > is on fucking CRACK . 
I still think < PROPFIRST>'s on crack . Just sayin ' . 
Blaaaah . 
So apparently it's a soon-to-be long standing joke that my Mommy is < PROPFIRST>'s ' manager ' . Wanna fuck her > : c ? RUN THE REQUEST BY MY MOM and see how much it's gonna cost ya . At least I get it part of the time free . Gotta test the merchandise/upgrades . -thumbs up- :3 
Suddenly I am mildly irritated . The hell , man . 
Why the hell did I get on facebook ... THE FUCK . 
Yay the drugs kicked in c : . I feel much better now xDD . And slightly productive . 
Oh dammi -- STUPID 21 QUESTIONS THING . STOP POSTING SHIT I DON'T WANT YOU TO . -rage- 
I love how the seriously traumatizing issues from my past are so hilarious to others . 
is going to try and take a break from at least the internet , since I sort of need my computer . Probably won't even work , but we'll see I guess . I don't really feel like talking to anyone right now anyway . 
has an ass 8D . The wonders of finally finding a pair of pants that look good AND feel comfortable . AND I can wear a size 12 c : . In Old Navy's pants , at least . Idk about anything else . 
Now my day/evening is kinda ruined by realizing something , thinking about it a little too much , and making myself slightly depressed , but not really . In other news , ' Dynamite ' by Taio < PROPFIRST > is too fuckin ' catchy > : c 
Fffffffffffffffffff -- 
So for some reason , I'm kind of in a bad mood . I don't know why . It just feels like for today I'd rather be sleeping the entire time instead of being awake at all . I can only think of one person I can kind of blame for it , but I don't like the fact that I'm at the point where I'm blaming them in the first place . Now it just got worse . 
So , last night , I re-watched Toy Story 3 . I had started watching it before on Megavideo , but they fail so I never saw the end , but dude . That shit was intense . I almost cried . My eyes hurt cause I was fighting back tears at one point . I TOTALLY RECOMMEND THAT MOVIE . It's just great in general . Good job , Pixar ! 
Oh my god my Mom made a facebook . She was asking me about it yesterday . She has NO idea what Facebook is even FOR , yet she STIIIILL made one . 
ANYONE HAVE ANY MOTIVATION THEY CAN SPARE ? CAUSE I NEED SOME . FFF -- RAISA I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING . YOU TEAMED UP WITH < PROPFIRST > TO STEAL ALL OF MI -- OH YOU WHORE I SAW WHAT YOU DID THERE GIVE IT BACK . 
Oi ! One of you people needs to move closer to me so we can go to Freddies together , dammit > : c 
Fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff -- 
Today is an awesome day . 
I hate when I see people from Bartlett or otherwise , because it's been forever and my memory is horribly sketchy . I'm never sure if it's really them o_o . Ooor if I got their name right , which makes me feel horrible . 
is happy to know she hasn't been forgotten , and wasn't the only one who remembered . 
OH MY GOD MY TWITTER HAS BEEN NEGLECTED FOR HOURS . THIS IS TERRIBLE . I MUST AMEND THIS . 
is on an adventure of epic proportions . 
I love how easily I can make < PROPFIRST > laugh :D 
Tetris , The Sims 3 , and Monopoly are indeed a very dangerous combination when < PROPFIRST > and I are together , but when you throw the cat in the mix , shit goes down . Baron is about ready to explode because of the feather and < PROPFEMALE > cat toy . He's shaking that badly , it's hilarious xD 
So , my attempt to have a calm , reasonable conversation with someone I completely resent turned into an argument because of the other person and their immaturity . 
OFF TO HARASS < PROPFIRST > AT HER HOUSE ! And then < PROPFIRST > this weekend hopefully ! No one can escape my love > : 0 . Or my never-ending to play Monopoly c : 
wonders why some people can't just make up their minds . I'm indecisive as well , but that's for simple things . Goodness ... 
This morning is filled with family issues and doctor appointments . Goody . 
Nevermind the word ' issues ' . This is war . 
So at the doctor's , one , she wouldn't do anything about my wrists . She said it's because I use the keyboard too much , whiiich sorry , but I can't stop using the computer . I have personal shit I like to write . I can't write it on paper because it doesn't work , and THAT actually hurts my wrists , which is why I don't do it . So , me being me , I was going to cry . 
SO PART THREE IN THIS THREE/FOUR PART STATUS , I did cry . I hope I scared the kids in the pediatrics waiting room . Though the doctor did say that if anything is wrong with my wrists , which bother me the most so I'm obviously upset nothing is being done , I might have a little bit of carpel tunnel . I'd need surgery for that , which scares me too , but still . 
I think it would be kind of nice if I could actually really , REALLY get my wrists looked at . By that I mean thoroughly fucking looked at so I can actually KNOW if anything is in-fact wrong with me . And then I have to take a blood test tomorrow , plus all this familial bullshit . Today is fucking awesome . 
http://boxerhockey.fireball20xl.com/ But at least today's < PROPFEMALE > made me feel a bit better . Thank you , < PROPMALE > Hesse ~ . God I love your shit . \ 
\ 
I forgot to post that about an hour or so ago . My bad . 
KISS IT MAKE IT BETTER ? 
WHY DO I HAVE TO BE SUCH A WOMAN ? I'M TOO SENSITIVE . No wonder they put me on a low estrogen ' oral contraceptive ' . The FUCK . I almost cried because I'm being forced to drink plain water without flavoring . I also ' realized'(though I knew this before ) that I can't take criticism , which is stupid . Constructive criticism ? Good . TALKING TO < PROPFIRST > ? BAD . WHY ARE WE FRIENDS D: 
I feel kind of bad when I don't reply to messages/talk to anyone for a while . It's not that anything's wrong , I just don't feel like talking to anyone o_o . What makes me feel bad is that I'll get on here when I'm bored or abuse Twitter , but I won't actually communicate with others xD ; 
Ffffffff registration is today D: . I DON'T WANNA , but I have to : c . So , that being said , watch out Highland , < PROPFEMALE>'s comin ' > : 0 
This is a day when Xanax and my cocktail of vitamins/medications comes in handy . 
Although I've already dropped off the face of the earth , I'm probably going to be around even less than before . That's what I expect , at least . Things around here are getting worse , and I don't know if I'll get into Highland or not . I just have to keep trying , get through my testing , and hope for the best , I suppose . 
It was a very , very good idea for me to decide to see a counselor again . I like her too , which is nice . Now back to spending my time trying to deal with shit , ignore my anxiety , pop some Xanax and play the fuck out of The Sims 2 . 
Also , I didn't totally just notice , but when something written or typed is meant to be heart-felt , mainly meaning to pull on one's heart strings , it's not as effective when you're completely illiterate about it . It just makes it amusing because of how horrible your grammar is . I'm a terrible person . I know that . 
Guess who got into Highland ? Fuck you , Ms. < PROPFIRST > , you discouraging whore ! I tested into a 9th grade Math level , which Ms. Hilger and I knew , but everything else I was apparently amazing at . Thank you , confidence and talent in Reading and Writing . And thank you Ms. Hilger and Dr. Blackman for giving me a < PROPMALE > , even if it's risky . 
Damn that status is mushy . Mom's going to come on here and say \OH BOO-BEE I'M SO PROUD OF YOUUU IT WASN'T A WASTE OF TIME AFTER ALL\ " but with all the necessary grammatical mistakes that comes with being ESL . I need to ruin this shit with something . I'll think of something horrible to say later . " 
Idk why but Facebook is freaking me the FUCK out right now . RUN < PROPFEMALE > RUN . 
Aw man I totally forgot what I was going to make a status about . NEVERMIND . 
Finally , after two days , I got my 250+ messages on devART down to 25 , ALL FROM THE SAME GROUP . And I don't even look at them all o_o . I weed through and take out anything written(unless I watch them personally ) and all the crap elementary school < PROPMALE > because I'm a horrible person . That site is working it's way through small ups and many downs , though . Goodness ... and yet I'm still that site's bitch . 
AW MAN school's on Wednesday , back to school picnic or whatever on Tuesday(I figured I should go . So did Ms. Hilger . I SHOULD BRING MINI ENCHILADAS ) , appointment with my therapist tomorrow morning , and then raping < PROPFIRST>'s house sometime afterward(more than likely ) . I just hope this year won't be as stressful as I think it will . Enough shit is going on , I don't need to be driven farther up the wall than I already am . 
I can hear Mom crying and yelling at someone on the phone methinks . Again . It bothers me , but for once I don't want to get up and go to her room . 
FFFFF FUCK YOU , LEFT WRIST . I USE YOU FOR NOTHING . WHY IS IT THAT YOU HURT AND TELL ME NOT TO WORK ? Why you do diiiis D: . WHY WILL THE DOCTOR NOT BELIEVE ME THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THEM . \ 
WHY AM I CONSTANTLY TYPING IN CAPITAL LETTERS . 
I AM EXCIIIIIIIIIIIITE , which makes up for the fact that I was anxious for no reason and missed my therapist appointmeeeent ~ 
Wish me luck . \ 
I really , really , really need it . For more than a few reasons , now . 
GUESS WHAT WORLD . The internet got cut off . Awesome :| . The only way I can have it is if I get on my Mom's laptop , but she's probably leaving for Boston today and is taking the laptop with her . So even if I was more talkative with others , I'm sorry D: 
At < PROPFIRST>'s invading her computer as she gets cleeean . Tested in to LA Lvl 5/6 ! Highest class I thiiink , and shockingly enough , especially for me , I'm in a higher class than < PROPFIRST > is o_o . And she writes way more than I do . I thought I'd have that class with her o_o . I AM SUPERIOR > : 0 
The downside of being in a 9 -11 advisory is that EVERYONE IS YOUNGER THAN ME . Well , not everyone . THOSE CHILDREN LOOK SO OLD . All of my friends are going to be in like ... the 10th grade D: . I've already got one in 8th , who I keep forgetting is actually that young . At least it doesn't make me feel horrible , JUST OLD . \ 
Is almost school tiem . 
Yay for the ACS USB Mobile Internet working , and FINALLY I have my fucking Educate and Gaggle accounts > : c . THEY FORGOT ABOUT ME AND NEVER MADE ME A GAGGLE . IT'S NOT THAT GREAT but I wanted to see my fucking classes/standards . I'd also like to mention that though I do like my advisory , just like eeevery other school and NOT just because of my short temper , there are people who piss me the fuck off and kill it for me . 
CONTINUING WITH THAT , I also like all of the very understanding teachers and the way students have a lot of free reign around there , because yay for breaking down in the middle of school . \ 
In other news , Mom and < PROPFEMALE > are going to be home in I think an hour , which is both good and bad . TIME TO SEE WHAT DAMAGE WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH . 
This isn't going to be a good weekend for me , is it . 
I should do my homework now but I'm too busy SINGIN ' AND DANCIN ' . Jus ' a lil ' bit . 
It's pathetic how I think I can get quite a few standards just by telling my life story . Goodness . 
Ffffffffffffffff -- 
It's stupid how , in the morning , I get all hyper since I immediately start listening to my music to wake me up . Then , when I get in the car , and get into school , shit happens . THANK YOU , ANXIETY , FOR RUINING MY DAY . EVERY DAY . \ 
Also , I enjoy liking things , dammit . 
I am the night . 
AUGH DUDE I THINK MY COUSIN'S DATING A WHITE GUY . DON'T DO IT , YADY . I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN READ THIS BUT DON'T DO IT . 
AW MAN I WANNA WRITE SO BADLY BUT I CAAAAAAAAAAAAN'T I'M BUSYYYYYYYYYY . But I know when I start writing I'll get bored . 
It's a shame that you're so gorgeous , yet you dress like a slut . 
Dammit , I fucking woke up late , eating makes my stomach hurt , and I'm going to be late for school , aren't I ? Awesome . Makes me feel so much better . 
I fucking hate my life . I really do . So much . 
Yaaay the Bartlett ladies came first in Cross-Country Running today c : . Or so I assume . South beat the boys , though , but I'm not too sure how that whole thing works . Cross-Country isn't exactly a spectator sport , but still . Was good to see Zach again after so long , and spotted two other people I knew c : . Good run , Zach ! 
GOD DAMMIT < PROPFIRST > AND < PROPMALE > . YOU FUCKERS MADE ME SIIIICK D: . I sound like a snuffluffagus D; . Fuckin ' assholes . I'm supposed to job shadow today , dammit >:| 
My Job Shadow went weeell c : . < PROPFEMALE>'s actually kinda cool . I just hope I can remember all the info to write my summary/essay . Though , < PROPMALE > said I could email him and he'd remind me , but I'd rather do it myself . I also got some additional documents , plus a written statement from him , which probably helps quite a bit . Next Exploratory Friday ? Job Shadowing < PROPFIRST > Gershell , aka our lawyer . :D 
I think it's cool how , if I'm social enough , I make friends really fast . I'm told I'm a very likable person c : . I'm just not all that charismatic . 
I miss my baaaabe D; -whine- 
Today isn't starting out too well , which sucks D; . Why do you hate me , body ?! 
Today was a good day c : 
AWESOME . ONCE I HAVE A GOOD DAY , I GET SICK . Fuck you people > : c . Though , was it worth it ? HMMMMMM POSSIBLY . 
I hate when I feel completely apathetic when I really should be caring about things . Dammit ! 
wonders how things will turn out in the end . 
Awesome . I accomplished nothing today except for painting my nails blue D: . FFFFFF -- good thing I have extensions on things . Gotta keep busy tomorrow ! 
Fffff -- My dear cousin , why do I have a mild sense of hatred for you ? I can't even read Spanish . Uuuugh D: \ 
I VOTE IT BE SUNDAY . 
Today was an awesome day ~ 
Anxiety is fucking bullshit . I hope my dentist appointment goes well , cause I still want to go to the damn library . I need to get shit done .

Perfect method for cheering your best friend up ? Singing the Pokemon Theme Song . The ORIGINAL . Works every time .

WOO GANG RAPE AT JAMIE'S THIS WEEKEND WITH BECCA . < PROPFIRST>'s the cream to our < PROPFEMALE > peanut butter and vanilla Oreo . Awwww yeaaah > : 0 . -goes to bed before I spew more nonsense- 
G'damn , I'm a freakin ' Bio-hazard , and so is my room . I'm coughing that much .

First it was thought that < PROPFIRST > and I were a bad combination . Throw Becca Weatherby in and at some point , the world is kind of screwed xD 
Too many reminders in one day . I don't know why it's effecting me just now , though . Oh well . 
Fuck you , obnoxious coughing fits . 
-insert amusing , depressing , or boring status here- 
doesn't have her own internet at the moment whatsoever . The only thing we have with internet is my Mom's laptop , which I have been TRYING to use , but it doesn't like to connect half the time . That and Mom has work to do on here . So , if you're wondering why I'm not around , that's probably why . 
I go to sleep at 8 , yet still wake up at 6 feeling tired and kinda like crap ? The hell . 
If only I could do things with no consequences whatsoever , at least for a little bit . Then again , even the thought of that makes me think too much , and sounds horrible . Damn D: 
SOMEONE BUY ME CAKE MIX AND FROSTING SO I CAN BAKE . RIGHT NOW . 
From the way I keep clearing my throat , I sound so freaking ENRAGED . 
There are both good upsides and horrible downsides to being at Highland . I believe that's all I'm going to say on that . 
can't fucking sleep . 
School time , I guess . Prove them wrong , < PROPFEMALE > ! 
It is the habit of an artist to come up with most of their ideas in the ungodly hours of the morn ' . 
Oh my goodness , some things . 
No I'm not totally wasting my time on the internet before school just so I can be purposely almost late , what are you talking about ?

It's horrible how much I can relate to my friends emotionally half the time , as well as things they have gone through , or are currently going through . When reading or thinking over what I say to try to help , it ends up looking like I'm trying to give myself the same advice I'm giving them . I'm such a hypocrite . 
It's funny how a lot of my bad days fall on days I have doctor's appointments . 
Life is kinda going down the tube and I'm scared to go to school tomorrow , but right now I'm in a generally good mood so I'll try looking on the brighter side . First thing that came to mind while writing this : I turn 18 in 20 days , therefore I am legal and can go to CASTLLLLE :D . And I can get sushi for birthday lunch after school or something before Thanksgiviiiing ! And there was something else but I forgot . 
Never exactly been on drugs ( well , of that sort ) , but DDR is a fucking trip when it's the god-awful hours of the morn ' before school and on no sleep . Just sayin ' . 
Yeaaaah I'm going to have to be careful at school . Me + Personal Problems + Lack of Sleep = Not too good . I say that instead of ' bad ' because it depends on what happens . Right now I started watching/listening to this a completely random animation and I am DYING . 
So , I've obtained a minnow for my group's eco-column in Biology . I have named it Joo-Joo . There will be no arguments . 
Apparently , don't argue with me about genetics , fools > : 0 . I will win . 
HEY , YO . BODY . I'M EATING . DO YOU SEE THE FOOD ? I'M EATING IT . I SHOULD NOT FEEL FAINT . Fuck is wrong with you > : c . 
So I couldn't help but notice the huge , obnoxious hickey on someone's neck today . What the hell xD . They could have at least TRIED to cover it up . That thing's gonna LAST . 
Oooh yeah . I knew I was going to go before , but to everyone who knows the whole divorce story , and of my ' father's ' stupidity , guess who's going to court December 3rd ? 
It feels horrible when you feel like you can't trust someone , or you start questioning them . 
Other than the fact that my hair got floofy and I didn't do as well on a test as I'd hoped , I had a nice day . Got and gave hugs , too c : . Too bad I really need to work today . Just hope I can manage to do it . Damn literary tool poster >_> . I want to actually turn in something on TIME , thanks . Also , I vote teachers enter grades faster . I hate looking at my educate and seeing no change when I turn shit in . 
Yay I got hits on educate c : ! Also , I really really really really really REALLY REALLY REALLY want Civilization V . It . Looks . Awesome . < PROPFEMALE>'s been looking for games and THAT IS ONE I WANT . Too bad my computer is a complete failure . I need a new one : c . I was also gonna spam something else but I forgot ... 
THE END IS NIGH . 
Staying up late to finish my literary poster so I can manage to turn at least one thing on time . This sucks D: 
SWEET , I HAVE OBTAINED CIVILIZATION IV ... but I don't know how the fuck to play it >_> 
Civilization IV is really addicting . WHY IS THIS . 
wonders why she feels been feeling so anti-social lately . THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED . WHAT THE HELL . 
Thank you , Mr. < PROPMALE > , for grading my work and giving me advanced hits on 5 different reading standards , but I'M NOT IN LEVEL TWO D: 
just noticed today that her birthday is next Saturday . Yay ? 
I FINALLY FINISHED MY DAMN LITERARY ELEMENTS POSTER . UGH . 
completed 4 standards in one day , and is the only thing she feels good about today . 
Fffff -- 
So my birthday's in a week from tomorrow . I have no idea what I'm going to do with myself . ANY IDEAS ? 
had an awesome day c : . And also has a general birthday idea . 
I can't freaking sleeeep 
Why the hell can't I sleeeep uuugh and yet I feel mildly ' refreshed ' . Until the anxiety hits . Then I'm in for shit . Until I take my meds . Then I'm okay for the day . I blame Jedediah < PROPMALE > Duff because I fucking can > : c 
Fuck you , ice storm . Getting in the way of my education D: 
You have no idea HOW MUCH I HATE THE INTERNET RIGHT NOW . 
Damn . I've been in my bed all night/day . I should do something productive . 
Fffffffff -- 
The internet is fucking me over , and has been . If you need me , text or call my phone , and if you need my number , harass < PROPFIRST > Jensen for it ? Iono . Or someone else who has it . 
Internet's working again c : 
Happy Thanksgiving everyone c : 
Not sure yet , but I think I might want to try . What that is , I'm not going to tell . 
Tomorrow is my birthdaaaaay which is kinda sorta being mildly celebrated today via hanging out with < PROPMALE > , but he's the one getting the cake :| . What is this > : c ? 
has had a very good day c : 
TODAY , I AM LEGAL . Now someone take me to Castle when I get money , dammit . Mommy won't take me : c . :D 
gives a mass THANK YOU to everyone who wishes her a happy birthday c : 
I don't think my weekend could get much better . I think I actually might be crying about it . Happy Birthday to me c : 
Fuck you , random insomnia . My plan was not to nap from 8pm to 10 something , then be unable to sleep the whole damn night . Hopefully I can be productive today . 
And no I totally do not feel like gagging and throwing up my medication . No , not at all . This isn't a very good start to my week . Hopefully it gets better . -ATTEMPTS BEING OPTIMISTIC- 
Runny nooooose in the morniiiiing why be dis . Also , I had a dream about food , and I woke up and I was like \Aw man I need to eat when I get up ... should eat the stuff I made yesterday ... \ " and then I check the time and it's 5 50 . 10 minutes before my first alarm xD . Also I still agree with < PROPMALE > Hummel that more people needed to have joined Quilting . " 
is going to listen to ' Saturday ' by Basshunter obsessively and make herself late for school at this rate . JUST ONE MORE TIME I SWEAR . 
is going to fucking suffer at school . Not only is it ALWAYS FUCKING COLD , but it's currently THREE DEGREES OUTSIDE ? WHAT THE FUCK . CAN I JUST EXCUSE A FEW OF MY FRIENDS FROM THEIR CLASSES SO WE CAN CUDDLE AND KEEP WARM ? 
doesn't feel good about anything right now . Dammit . 
I took 6 Ibuprofin and my head STILL fucking hurts . What the hell . Today isn't the best of days . Hopefully it will be better tomorrow ... 
My head still hurts , and it is time to clean , but SOON . SOOOON .

Yay for going to the movies with Jedediah < PROPMALE > Duff tomorrow after school ~ . FINALLY . 
Today has been both horrible and mildly entertaining , but < PROPMALE > throwing a muffin at a girl's face for making fun of him ( and us ) and making us do a weird dance stomp thing at Red Apple that made me giggle really oddly made up for it c : . Too bad I woke up from my nap in pain D: 
Relating back to my last status made , the day might have been made a little better at some point , but it's going back down , and this week has been fucking horrible . 
It's sad how I only manage to confirm my assumption that my Mom is home by noticing she's signed in on Facebook . 
Guess who's getting his hair straightened on Christmas < PROPFEMALE > ? -stares at Jedediah < PROPMALE > Duff- 
And guess who's making us dress up for pictures on Christmas < PROPFEMALE > ? -stares at < PROPFEMALE > Isbell- You bitch > : c
