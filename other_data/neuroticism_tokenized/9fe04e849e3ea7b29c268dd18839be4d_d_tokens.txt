It's been a while , Since I've gone and fucked things up just like i always do . It's been a while , But all that shit seems to disappear when i'm with you . 
Now that the world isn't ending , it's love that I'm sending to you . It isn't the love of a hero , that's why I fear it won't do . And they say that a hero could save us . I'm not gonna stand here and wait . I'll hold on to the wings of the eagles . Watch as we all fly away . 
I'm over it . You see I'm falling in the vast abyss . Clouded by memories of the past . At last , I see I hear it fading . I can't speak it . Or else you will dig my grave . We fear them finding . Always whining . Take my hand now . Be alive .
