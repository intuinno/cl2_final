Livin in the Bronx ! Greatest time of my life ! 

So glad the Verizon guy just came and hooked up our internet . 
I hear kids outside screaming in 3 or 4 different languages . 
First day as a maid ... I better get a good tip . 
I heard today that someone was served a steak with a tampon at the Waldorf Astoria . 
Good things are starting to happen . 
Just got back from seeing < PROPFIRST > McCartney in Citi Field ! 
Money or freedom ? 
ever so very very nice to live with a talented musician 
drinking some Puerto Rican vodka shit out of a plastic bag . It's called Gasolina and that's exactly what it tastes like . 
sleepytime 
Buh Bye Bronx . 
wish they would let you wear skates on the subway 
20 cops outside my bedroom window 
NYC in the summertime = sweaty ass all the time 
Still trying to figure out this whole mobile upload thing . Finally got a phone ! 
Right now I'm on a mission to find some Boddingtons . 
Really missing the good old days at the compound . It's amazing how things change so quickly . 
It's totally worth being sick to not work today . 
Sometimes it's nice to be free of the things we take for granted . 
moving day :) 
Wow ... we actually have internet now for the first time in over a month . 
so happy to finally get a day off 
I don't get it . People actually go through the trouble to take the train 6 blocks . It's like people who drive to the mailbox . 
Closed down Cubbyhole last night . :) Paying for it today . Good times though . 
Just fell asleep in the hallway outside the front door cause < PROPMALE > forgot the keys ... then he tried to climb up the fire escape ... then he realized he had them all along . 
After whipping ass in a crazy raucous game of beer pong at < PROPMALE>'s Dilemma last night I kissed this dude cause he had a handlebar mustache and was drinking a carton of milk in the middle of a bar . 
I had a man come into the restaurant today , pull off his dirty sock ( just one sock ) and straighten it out on the table next to his coke before he had his breakfast . 
Watched Manhattan last night , never realized it was all Upper West Side . I hear Woody < PROPFIRST > still has a place in the neighborhood . I SO enjoyed my walk to work today . :) 
Need a change . About to dye my hair red . 
just walked to the store . Wind chill of 31 degrees right now ! Winter up here's gonna kick my ass . 
Damn this delicious NY pizza ! 
goji berries and almond butter ... cookies perhaps ? 
soooo sick . Bleh . 
I hate being sick ! Send me good vibes please . :) 
My roommates are actually watching the < PROPFEMALE > Montanna movie right now . 
Thanks Miller , for going all the way across town to buy my sick bitchy ass some fruit and yogurt . :) 
just wants to sleep late , just for one day . I hate having to go to bed early . 
This is just turning out to be just too much fun to resist ... if you are reading this , whether we do or don't speak often , please post a comment of the first memory you have of me and you that pops in your head . When you've finished , post this paragraph on your own status ; you will be surprised what people remember about you .. 
would love nothing more than a cigarette & a beer right now . Been a little over a week since I've had either . 
really wants to go run around town & join the crazies 
really wish life had an option to pause or rewind 
is feeling quite inspired ... 
work work work ... It sucks that having a \good ' schedule as a server means you have to work away your weekend . " 
can't sleep 
making cookies . I think cold weather brings out my sweet tooth . 
Ooh lightning ! Nice . :) 
It's about time for a good thunderstorm . 
blitzed and going to bed 
Just woke up and stumbled into the livingroom to < PROPMALE > playing \Long Long Long\ " ... Little things like that make my life beautiful . :) It's gonna be a good day . " 
is makin pizza . 
sleepy time 
It gets frustrating sometimes being the only girl in a house full of guys . < PROPMALE > you're excluded . At least you don't drink all my soda , pee on the toilet seat or sing Journey at the top of your lungs at 3:00 AM . 
Wow , our elevator's down . This blows . 
I <3 < PROPFIRST > Sagan . 
Getting up early tomorrow morning to watch the < PROPFEMALE>'s Thanksgiving Day parade IN PERSON ! So excited . 
a bottle of wine and two pitchers in ... night all .. happy thanksgiving . 
How is it possible to eat grapes loudly ? 
Planning my next tattoo ... I really want a Chinese dragon , but I've gotta get something Beatles related . Gotta . 
Man I really want some good queso . Nowhere to be found . Guess I'm gonna have to make my own . 
Salma Heyek in From Dusk Till < PROPFEMALE > .... 
Wow just found out that Babe < PROPFEMALE > used to live in our building . Makes sense I guess . Yankee Staduim is right across the river . 
Make it through 5 hours early in the morning , and I'm free for the next 2 days . 
Epic New Years ! Wastey faced , mad dancing , horn blowing , passing out in laser tents , fights with cops and one horrible french guy , face painting , a duet between cookie monster and < PROPFEMALE > , strip searches ... I don't think I could top it if I had to . 
It wouldn't be a holiday without crappy ranchero music blaring from the neighbors upstairs . 
Peace ! Peace ! Supplant the doom and the gloom ! Turn off what is sour ! Turn into a flower and BLOOM ! BLOOM ! BLOOM ! 
Just quit smoking and really didn't want to ..... urg ... 
Watched NKOTB videos with my roommate tonight . Yeah , that's right . 
weeping on a < PROPFEMALE > , sleeping on a pillow , leaping armadillo 
Well I'm not sleeping tonight . Eewww eeww eeww !!! is all I have to say . 
Wow a little bit of < PROPFEMALE > really does make greek yogurt not taste like ass . 
in a < PROPMALE > Waits kinda mood . 
contemplating metaphysics 
I'd really love a thunderstorm . 
DINOSAURS !! 
I <3 Whole Foods . 
Right now our cat's purr sounds like the faint chirp of a cricket . 
saw some really crazy mess riding home watching the tracks through the window in the front of the train tonight . 
I don't understand it why boys scream at the TV when they watch football . I get its a whole different thing if you're actually there ... but ...??? 
We are stardust . We are < PROPFEMALE > . 
wants to go to the park and lie in the grass and bask in the sunshine . I need a break from the rain and cold and concrete . 
Looking out my bedroom window at the skyline . I can almost see the river . The sky's overcast and reflecting an orangish glow . It's really quite beautiful ... and an unusually peaceful , serene night in Manhattan . I'm sleeping with my blinds pulled up . 
in the mood for a strange dream 
just woke up to snow . 
Take all your problems and rip ' em apart . < PROPFEMALE > them off in a shopping cart ... 
Now the curtain opens on a portrait of today and the streets are paved with passersby and pigeons fly and papers lie waiting to blow away ... 
I wish there were some way to capture the images that I wake up to in the reflection of my TV set when it's off . 
Static electricity is giving me hell today ! 
Yes , indeed . 
Ow , hot sauce in my eye . 
Go to Urbandictionary.com, type in your first name , and copy/paste this as your status & the definition as your first comment 
I'm so cozy , full , happy , enamored , inspired ... and I mean , it's sunset and there's crickets on my sound machine ... and I so don't wanna crawl out of my big fluffy bed right now and go work for the rest of the night . :P 
just spent the entire train ride home with a drunk Russian tourist sitting across from me and taking photos of me enjoying some delicious string cheese and minding my own business 
Whole grain mustard and dill . Amazing . 
Now I'm on a mission to find something cold and fruity . 
... guava 
So happy to wake up ! Just escaped the worst nightmare ever . 
Beatles before bedtime ... :) <3 
watching giant snowflakes float outside my window ... 
breaking out the Manic Panic 
It's one of those days when I hate my job and I'd give anything to just stay in bed . I'm gonna find a way to be optimistic though . :) 
rode a wooden escalator tonight . 
It's a completely different experience watching snow from my window five stories up . There's an updraft so the wind's stirring it all around and it's just kindof lingering , floating , not falling .... pretty . 
That's the second time this week I've dreamt of helicopters . 
just watched < PROPMALE > put hot sauce up his nose 
lost in the white album 
gettin crafty with fimo 
Hanging out with < PROPMALE > . Nice creative flow . Listening to The Beatles . All is right . 
< PROPMALE > Kimbrough is exactly what I needed today . 
decided that on a night like tonight it's perfectly acceptable to take a cab 4 blocks to the train station . 
I love that crazy hazy state of mind when you first wake up . 
Dream sweet dreams for me . Dream sweet dreams for you . 
trying to make peace with my flaws and grow from my mistakes 
Why do I feel like TurboTax just ripped me off ? 
Mimosas and A Hard Day's Night -- Perfect start to my day . <3 
My roommate just discovered his only clean pair of underwear in the kitchen drawer . 
Thank you so much everyone for the birthday wishes . I'm suffering perhaps the worst hangover ever . I feel like death ... so know that if I go out I go out in the comfort of feeling very very loved . 
Today I saw a lamp grown from bioluminescent hamster cells . For real . 
It's so hard to break myself away from my big fluffy bed in the morning . 
My news feed is all screwed up and I can't fix it . 
Just bought my first ipod . Nano . Orange . 16GB . Beautiful . I'm super excited . 
Some days it's hard to wrap my head around the fact that I've never felt this happy or loved or lucky or inspired . Things are amazingly great and just keep getting better . 
Just can't seem to function today . 
is so lucky to have such a kickass , sexy as fuck , gracious roomate in < PROPFIRST > . And what amazing abs . I mean , fuck ........ those things are like , greek statue beautiful .... 
Electric Arguments suits me perfectly in the middle of a night like this . 
After heavy light years of tenacious trajectory a ball of fire spat through space spitting sparks and flames at new blue universe . 
The newspaper machine is NOT a toilet !!!! 
Having my first meyer lemon with an icy cold bottle of Pellegrino . :) 
Time to dig deep and find the strength to make it through my day tomorrow . Optimism find me . 
Can't figure out why I'm craving coffee lately . 
One day off and on call constantly in a span of 2 weeks = not okay . I'm trying to keep my head up but it's not a good feeling when your job completely takes over your life . It's my first spring in NYC and it's beautiful outside . I just want to experience it . That's worth so much more than the extra money to me . 
trying to be optimistic 
Why do clean sheets feel so good ? 
They said get back honky cat Better get back to the woods Well I quit those days and my redneck ways And oh the change is gonna do me good 
Our AA just called me up and said \Hey < PROPFEMALE > are you tired ? Why don't you take the night off . \"" 
Ready for a thunderstorm . 
So so so so excited I just got a little 3 day mini vacation . 
Dude , I wanna pull that silver spoon out of your mouth and shove it right up your ass . 
So I'm walking to work and a bird just shat all over my head ... 
She comes skimming through rays of < PROPFEMALE > . She could < PROPMALE > in a drop of dew . 
off to go busking in the park with < PROPMALE > :) 
It's a Nag Champa day for sure . 
Another amazing night just roaming around ... When You're Strange @ the < PROPFEMALE > , SoHo < PROPMALE > galleries and cobblestone streets , dinner outside @ < PROPMALE>'s , some Ayurvedic shopping , tea and people watching in East Village ... LoVe LoVe LOVE my life here . Thanks < PROPMALE > . Couldn't imagine experiencing this with anyone else . <3 
Just saw The Runaways ... Man ... < PROPFEMALE > Fanning ...... It's wrong , it's just wrong . 
would much rather be playing in the park than going to work :P 
I'm in a restaurant FULL of people and they're ALL silent , mesmerized by Deal or No Deal on the TV in the corner ... weird . 
Overwhelmed with emotion and inspiration . I need a creative outlet and quick . 
Just found 9 little baby ducks and their mama lazing in the sunshine at the lake . So sweet ... :) 
Ugh , hangover . After not really drinking for three or four months , my body hates me right now . 
still covered in magic < PROPFEMALE > dust 
SO freakin thirsty ... 
I want some of that crazy weather . 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > chameleon ... 
There was a tornado in Abbeville ?? I can't get in touch with my dad . I hope he's ok . 
Tasty vodka drinks and a coconut melon hookah in Lower East Side ... 
My dad just left me a voicemail singing < PROPFEMALE > Wolly Doodle so I'm guessing that means he's fine . :) 
The screen just fell out of my 5th floor window and I can't figure out how the hell to get it back in ... 
I love cheese . 
Watching a very angry man fight with a cop in Times Square ... Dude cops are EVERYWHERE . 18 I've counted right now within eyesight . They've got this place on loc 
\We're the only bird that shits its own nest . \ " ~ < PROPFIRST > McCartney " 
Here's to brown bagging it . 
Why is it that I wake up the most cozy when I have to get up early and go to work ? 
The wind is blowing so hard it's shaking our building . 
< PROPFEMALE > White is the shit ! 
This makes twice a stranger has come up to me and just helped themselves to whatever I was eating . New Yorkers have balls . 
I can hear < PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE > halfway down The Mall ... 
Had a dream last night that I was living with < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > and we were working together on a book about Mississippi juke joints . 
No carbs for about 5 days now ... still craving pizza but feeling so much better . 
When you've seen beyond yourself then you may find peace of mind is waiting there and the time will come when you see we're all one and life flows on within you and without you . <3 
Just walked in on < PROPMALE > playing < PROPMALE > & Garfunkel . <3 Enamored . 
Champagne mangos are so much better than regular ones . 
R . I . P Dio . 
Can you just develop a food allergy out of the blue ? 
wants to play with fire . 
Just cut < PROPMALE>'s hair ... 
\If the doors of perception were cleansed everything\ 
Woke up with Mr. Peepers . 
<3 <3 <3 <3 
Apple chai ? Yes , please . 
Nothing describes the smell of a train full of sweaty drunk Yankees fans . 
I <3 watermelon . 
Just found out my Dad is coming to visit in 6 days !!! I haven't seen him in a year . :D 
Twice this week I've seen celebrities eating at really shitty pizza places in UWS . It was < PROPMALE > Baldwin today . 
green apple splatters 
It's such an amazing feeling when good < PROPFEMALE > comes back around to you . 
< PROPFIRST > White takes the cake . 
It's 9AM and my dad is gone . Phone is dead . He doesn't know how to buzz us to get back in to the apartment . Way to worry the shit out of me . Man , I hope he doesn't get lost . 
Looks like we're having a Bonanza marathon in the house today ... 
french fries with my dad at Yankee Stadium 
Happy Birthday to my Daddy !!!! <3 <3 <3 <3 
We've officially moved and now I'm taking my dad back to the airport . It's been quite a week . :) 
Just said bye to my dad . This is one of the only times I've ever seen him cry . Wish him a safe flight . 
Just jumped my first train fare . 
Someone should walk around with a febreeze gun and spray stinky people . 
What ever happened to flamin ' hot funyuns ? 
My mom and stepdad are flying in tonight ! :) It's been a year since I've seen them too . Having lunch with my Aunt < PROPFEMALE > tomorrow . Strange everyone is visiting all at once . :) 
bleaching my hair 
<3<3<3<3 HAPPY BIRTHDAY < PROPMALE > !!! <3<3<3<3 \ 
Here's to the end of the curse , our continuing adventure , and the beginning of an even better year . \ 
I love you so much . Thanks for bumming cigarettes and making my life amazing . :D 
Officially became a New Yorker exactly one year ago today . 
I was actually happy to go to work today and they sent me home . 
Look out grilled cheese . Quesadillas just came riding in on blue corn tortillas ... with tasty onions and Red Devil hot sauce . Hell yeah . 
Ok seriously ... just went on my last junk binge at the grocery store . Damn hormones . NO MORE ! Man , it's a hard roll off that wagon . 
Enjoying my first slurpee all to myself and it's AMAZING . I <3 7 ELEVEN . 
Had the most amazing cream puff ever today ... and it made me sicker than I've been in months . :( Got sent home from my closing shift and everything ... 
sitting on the beach @ Coney Island drinking Corona and waiting on fireworks ... Life is beautiful . <3 :) 
I lost my phone last night . It's history . :( 
So I was walking down the street tonight and next to a church , next to a little green coin operated mechanical horse , I saw two guys with a giant blue hookah on the side of the street selling hits for $1 . I <3 my neighborhood . 
Look , I understand too little too late . I realize there are things you say and do you can never take back , but what would you be if you didn't even try ? You HAVE to try . So , after a lot of thought , I'd like to reconsider . PLEASE . If it's not too late ...... Make it a cheeseburger . 
Never realized that wintergreen is in root beer . 
Here comes the ice cream truck ! ... Still freaks me out a little . 
Slowly learning Spanish ... 
Spent 15 mintues watching this drunk ratty bum dig into a garbage can like a starving man at a buffet ... drinking and eating EVERYTHING till he got to the bottom ... then he straightened the bag and chased away some pigeons so he could crawl around and pick some crumbs off the street . 
Procrastination , I don't want to deal with you today . 
<3 <3 < PROPFIRST > Adams < PROPFEMALE > Wheat <3 <3 
Just got a popsicle with no stick . 
So I just spent 10 minutes struggling with my door lock . Every time I opened it , someone locked it back . I thought it was < PROPMALE > playing games with me ... finally got in . Thing is , he's gone and my house is completely empty . I just went downstairs to the market for a minute , purposely left it unlocked , same thing happened again !!! WTF is going ON ?! Seriously , I'm the only one home . Just me and the cat . 
< ~ Future Brooklynite . \ 
East Williamsburg beckons ... <3 
Man , I only get stung maybe once a year and it's ALWAYS on the 4th of July . Every year without fail . It's like a curse or something . 
No work for me today because my alarm didn't go off and I overslept . For real this time . :) < PROPMALE>'s writing a song about it right now . It's gonna be a great day . 
Did a moving job tonight packing the master bedroom of a < PROPMALE > psycho designer obsessed MONSTER . Lady , I can't pack your 30 pairs of $1000 boots if I can't touch them . 
Having one of those days that's so ridiculously lucky , I'm wondering if I should go play the lotto or something . 
Uuugggghhhh .... Have to try and be productive today despite my horrible hangover . \ 
I've gotta get things on track . 
Hangover funk sucks . I need a hug . 
slightly obsessed with Hawaiian Punch 
The Dharma Bums 
< PROPMALE>'s been out busting his ass all day just to make our dreams a reality . <3 \ 
You're awesome , Miller . Best friend ever . 
curious about tamarind ... I have yet to try it . 
I miss my Mamaw ... <3 
How long does it take to break in new boots ? 
After all this time , nothing centers me like losing myself in The Beatles . Especially in solitude , in a candle lit room , lava light , Nag Champa flowing through open windows ... <3 It's my most comforting constant . 
So I was walking down the street today and it hit me like a ton of bricks . Something's happened . Uh oh , I've crossed over . I've crossed the line to Stones fanatic . Yep , I'm one of those people . I think it's serious . 
Forgot how much happiness one little Hershey's kiss can bring . 
I'm trying to understand why my neighbors insist on setting off fireworks every morning around 3AM . 
What I would give for a private pool right now ... I need to be in the water . They opened the fire hydrant outside my building today and I came so close to jumping in it ... 
Nothing quite as refreshing as a walk in a thundershower ... 
I must own a xylophone . 
Love to my Campground family . Miss you all . Wish I could be there this week . It's been way too long . <3 
I never realized stray cats were such a problem in Brooklyn . Tried to walk up and call to a little tuxedo kitten this afternoon that I thought was just sunbathing , but it was dead . I got pretty emotional about it . Apparently it's a common occurrence in our neighborhood . 
Weathering the storm . I'm just gonna go to sleep , wake up to a new day and try my best to be optimistic . :) 
It's packing and cleaning for me today . Tomorrow starts a new chapter . 
on autopilot 
Get ready , NYC ! < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > Flake and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > fly in this afternoon ! 
They're doing construction on our building and they just cut the water off before I could finish washing my hair so now I'm going downstairs to the market a soapy mess to buy a gallon of water and finish the job . WTF . 
Awesome night out on the town with < PROPMALE > & < PROPFEMALE > . Finally settled in Brooklyn . :) 
I forgot how nice it is to wake up and sit in your own yard early in the morning . :) 
We have a roll of bright pink toilet paper in our bathroom . I thought they outlawed that shit . 
So happy to live in a place where I can buy high alcohol content beers at 4AM . 
It's < PROPMALE > & < PROPFEMALE>'s last day . It's gonna be a good one . 
Harlem smells like Black & Milds today . For real . 
Seems to me that Brooklyn is to Manhattan what < PROPFIRST > is to Oxford . 
I've been up since 6:30 on my day off . What's wrong with me ? 
Tonight < PROPMALE > found 8 boxes of waffles , frozen berries , baby ducks , and a disco ball , all in the free section of craigslist , all in the same neighborhood . Amazing . 
Half asleep and stranded in the rain waiting for my boss ... for at least the next hour I'm guessing . Couldn't find my metrocard this morning ... It's just not my day today . 
Vodka Kool-Aid 
chocolate covered fig newtons 
So happy I can see the stars from my back yard . It's been a while . <3 
$1.25 soda , $1.25 beer . Which would you choose ? 
Easy peasy lemon squeezy . 
I'm sick as hell . I can't figure out if it's a bad cold or sinusitis or both . Guess it's just that time of year . Send me good vibes , please ? 
Ran into < PROPFIRST > Lennon on my walk home from work today , quite literally . Lots of giggles and funny looks were exchanged . :) 
Man , I miss Pizza Hut lunch buffet . 
Ready to get this sickness gone . 
You'd think a movie called Killer Clowns from Outer Space would be the most awesome thing ever ... Well , you'd be wrong . 
My eyes are getting heavy but I just lost a big black menacing spider somewhere in my room so I'm scared to go to sleep ... Hopefully we can coexist for now and he'll just stay in his little nook and I'll just stay in mine . 
Took a crazy ass tumble head first down the stairs today at the train station and guess who came to my rescue out of the blue : Marybess Pritchett , that's who . :) Thanks . <3 
I <3 MY CITY ! 
< PROPMALE > Kimbrough , PBR and a bonfire in the back yard . :) 
Ram and rainbow chip cupcakes 
In a standoff with THE BIGGEST ROACH ON EARTH !! 
Well you get down the fiddle and you get down the bow , kick of your shoes and you throw em in the floor ... 
$8 an hour flyering on the side for the company I work for just became mandatory and it SUCKS . 
Done worrying about what's out of my control . 
Ate 5 bananas today . 5 . 
Broccoli is farts reincarnated . 
I think it's about time to try to quit smoking again . 
It's been a beautiful night . Just left the hustle & bustle of the city , now enjoying the rustle of leaves and windchimes and a nice cold beer in the back yard . Thanks for a great day , < PROPMALE > . <3 
Excuse me , I'll have a falafel with hot sauce , a side of baba ganoush and a seltzer , please . 
Goodbye < PROPFIRST > , me gotta go , me oh my oh ... Me gotta go pull the pirogue down the bayou ... 
Jack-o'-lantern! 
Time to gank < PROPMALE>'s flannel . 
I just don't have it in me to go to bed before 3am . 
Biscuits and coffee at eight in the evening ... :) 
I swear it's like I'm living in a movie ... 
<3 Happy birthday < PROPFIRST > . <3 
< PROPMALE > Quinto . 
If you were me , what would you do with your day ? 
white chocolate drizzled fruity pebbles treats <3 
Oh man , I'm starting to think pistachios aren't so wonderful . 
I've got anew phone . Lost all my < PROPFIRST > , so text me if you want to stay in touch . 16467789485 
The cat PEED ON OUR BED last night . Now it's laundry and sheet shopping all day for me . 
Sleep injury . How can you mess up your back while you're sleeping ?! I've never had back problems . Is this what it feels like to be an old geriatric ? 
Time for the morning smoke and cup of tea . 
I honestly believe that my friends and family back in MS give a shit , but they're all just really bad at staying in touch . Love you all . :) <3 
Might be getting a pet monkey !!!!! 
Starting to realize that dying my hair neon red wasn't the best idea after all . :) Blue would have been much better . 
< PROPMALE > Miller is AMAZING . 
Wow , I've had waaaaaay too much coffee . Caffeine overload . Any way to counteract that ? 
<3 Don't ever think for a second that I take for granted how ridiculously lucky I am to be so loved . 
< PROPMALE > Nilsson is eating my brain . 
spaghetti sandwiches 
Slowed down on the smoking and I'm pretty happy about it . 
The bedroom windows of my basement apartment are right at street level and I just can't get used to the sound of people walking and talking above my head . 
< PROPMALE > , Genesee Cream ale , homemade pizza and amazing company . :) Doesn't get much better than this . I <3 my life . 
After heavy light years of tenacious trajectory a ball of fire spat through space spitting sparks and flames at a new blue universe . 
I want blueberry muffins . 
Everyone in my house is dancing around singing Disney songs ... 
Ok I'm gonna give this Q & A thing a shot . You better make it good . 
Just taught < PROPMALE > to make pizza . :) 
I just watched a Folgers commercial and cried . What ? I probably shouldn't admit that , but I'm just sayin ... PMS . Be patient with us . It's not fun being nuts . 
Nothing will wake you up in the morning like a homeless man pooping on the train . 
Time to < PROPMALE > the chef pants once again ! Interview tomorrow . :) I've missed the heat . 
I'm totally about to sell out , but I'll be able to pay my rent for the month with what I make in a day . Is it worth it ? 
YAY NEW STOVE !! Thanks , < PROPMALE > ! :) 
< PROPMALE>'s already a bottle of wine and a glass of < PROPFEMALE > into it . :) I made a queso disaster . We've got Beatles blaring and animals swiping food off my plate every time I turn my head . Happy Thanksgiving ! 
I've got the itis . 
Looks like the server thing is still up in the air so I start the cafe in about 2 hours . 
Our new roommate keeps pissing all over the toilet seat . Dude , you're a grown man and that's a big hole . Just sayin . 
I was thinking of going into town but I didn't realize the tree lighting is tonight . No way I'm fighting that crowd . NO WAY . 
There's a 1987 Ole Miss basketball tshirt in the thrift store across the street from my house . Wonder how ther hell it found its way to Brooklyn . 
First snow !!! It's magical ... <3 
Pandemonium Shadow Show , a big bowl of Crunch Berries , and snow outside my window ... <3 <3 <3 
Strange , the point when late becomes early . 
Tonight was a celebration of love , true friendship , and my greatest influence . Thanks < PROPMALE > , Ally and Marybess . <3 
Just stumbled into the bathroom half asleep and stepped on a shard of glass . 
Our humongus jacuzzi got me through winter last year . Now it's gone ... and I'm cold . 
5 Pointz , FAO Schwarz , Bethesda Terrace , < PROPFEMALE>'s Tea Cup , < PROPFEMALE>'s Pizza , The MET , Beard Papa's , Time < PROPMALE > Center , Ghostbusters Headquarters , bed . :) G'night . 
Finally saw Pirate Radio . Fantastic . 
Wow is it really monday already ? 
We are stardust . Billion year old carbon . We are < PROPFEMALE > ... caught in the devil's bargain and we've got to get ourselves back to the garden . 
< PROPFIRST > McCartney is playing the Apollo tonight and I WANT TO BE THERE ! 
It's like the freakin north pole up here . 
If you want christmas cookies from me , I need addresses . 
Looks like it's time to pay a visit to Hope Depot and insulate this apartment . SO COLD ! 
Just walked all the way to the train station to buy < PROPMALE > a metrocard so he won't have to do it in the morning before work . Now I can't feel my legs . :) That's love . 
Time to crawl out of my big cozy bed , face the cold , and go to work ... Good thing it's right around the corner . :) 
Just got the cheeziest , most delicious pizza I've ever seen in my life . 
\A fly is as likely to land on shit as it is on pie . \ " ~ < PROPFEMALE > Fisher " 
amaretto coffee <3 
wonder if I should visit Oxford in the spring ... 
Guess I'm gonna get ready to crawl out of bed , grab a cup of tea and try not to freeze as I watch this lunar eclipse . Wish I had rooftop access around here . 
It's no fun , this abrupt early morning end to my snuggles ... 
I've just had more < PROPFEMALE > pie than any one person should consume in a sitting . 
Bleh . Opening shift . I DO NOT want to get out of bed this morning , but if < PROPMALE > can get up at 5:30 to walk in the cold and fight with Polish people I guess I can go bake some cookies or something . :P Wish me a good day and I'll do the same . 
Pipes are cold . I am not ok with our heat being off this early in the morning . 
Auburn it is . 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas everybody ! Thanks for making it great , < PROPMALE > . Love to my friends and family . Miss you all very much . <3 
I've been joking about us having to tunnel our way out of the house but it looks like that might actually happen . 
Snowpocalypse ! 
YAY ! TRUE BLOOD MARATHON !! <3 <3 
I'm not really sure why I'm watching a documentary on the Sears Roebuck catalog , but it reminds me of my grandma telling me that when she was a little girl , that's what they used for toilet paper in their outhouse . 
Why do I always for get how much I LOVE strawberry cream cheese ? 
<3 <3 <3 HAPPY NEW YEAR !! <3 <3 <3 
Oh , drunk facebooking . What shame . 
Just dyed < PROPMALE>'s hair black . 
Every once in a while I wake up to the sound of a car door slamming and wonder who's pulled in to my driveway . Then I remember I'm in Brooklyn . :) 
I sent my boss a very long email last night calling her out on her unsanitary food practices and irresponsibility . I have to deal with it face to face in about 2 hours . 
Halfway through my last carton of cigarettes ... I need to start slowing this down . 
I think I'm going to take up sitar . 
Isn't it strange , the songs that get stuck in your head ? It's been The Little Mermaid with < PROPMALE > all day and I just found myself singing Conway Twitty in the shower . Make it stop ! 
We're dysfunctional to the core , but I <3 my family . :) 
Sesame chive spaghetti and smoked cheddar on french sourdough , grilled with garlic < PROPMALE > butter . That's right . I just took the spaghetti sandwich to a whole new level . 
Just went from sleeping on the floor to sleeping about 4 feet high . Lets hope I don't roll off the bed any more . 
Just learned that the caesar salad originated in < PROPFEMALE > , Mexico . Who knew ? 
< PROPMALE > and I both just hurt our lip in a matter of seconds . Me on a cigarette and him on a bottle of coffeemate . Explain that ? 
listening to four homeless men argue apocalyptic theories ... 
This soy milk does not do my chocolate coffee justice . 
Watching a news segment of a man reading a newspaper . I don't understand . 
<3 < PROPMALE > . 
I'm LIVID . I can't get any peace from the roommate next door . Any < PROPMALE > for rest is SHOT . Either it's video games at 5am or in the case of today , it's some little twirp who is cackling while orgasming ... for the last hour . All I want is duct tape and an air horn . 
rosebud tea <3 
Dreamed that some banjo picking appalachian mountain man told me I was the peanut in his peanut butter sandwich and he was the bread . 
< PROPMALE > cleaned and did the laundry before I even woke up today . <3 
Snowthunder lightning storm !! 
Snow angels and sledding down my front steps with < PROPFIRST > Dunbar and Smokin ' < PROPFEMALE > ! So much fun ! I feel like a kid ... 
New phone . I need your < PROPFIRST > . Text me : 3477657722 
Locked outside my house in the snow with some Zapp's Cajun Dill Gator Tators ... It could be worse , right ? 
< PROPMALE > Miller lap dances ... Jealous Bitches ??? 
I miss thunderstorms . 
So nice to be with someone who hates football as much as I do . I think this is the first time there's ever been peace in my house on Superbowl Sunday . <3 
Will it go round in circles ? 
Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da 
Hey everybody , it's < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > !! 
Marstinis and an oreo icecream mountain @ Mars 2112 ! Happy < PROPFIRST>'s Day ! 
Best < PROPFIRST>'s Day EVER . I didn't think we could top last year . :) Thanks , < PROPMALE > . <3 
I've just watched the entire first season of Treme in one sitting . 
I want some fried okra . 
We're early morning explorers off to Rockaway beach to watch the sunrise . 
Job interview .. Good vibes , please . :) 
I can't help it . My heart resides in Upper West Side . <3 A pitcher of < PROPFEMALE > wheat and English cotswald in a sourdough baguette from Zabar's .. on a bench .. sunset .. traffic whizzing by ... Life is beautiful . 
Hope you guys down south are enjoying your warm weather . I'm standing in a few inches of snow ... :P 
4700 teachers in the city to be laid off ? All hired since 2007 ? Cutting cop and firefighter benefits ? I <3 my city but get your priorites right , Bloomberg . What a douchebag . 
One day soon we'll be able to sing The Jeeffersons theme song and mean every word of it . :) 
Just got a firefly & soda and it made me tear up a little bit . :) Tastes like home . 
Just got the keys to our new apartment ! 
Can anybody in Oxford get their hands on a bottle of firefly muscadine vodka ? If so , I'll pay for postage , compensate you , and throw in a little extra . 
< PROPMALE>'s rockin my flares today . < PROPFIRST > Plant style ... :D 
If anybody wants to have a birthday hookah or drinks with me tomorrow , let me know . 
In less than 5 hours the countdown to 30 begins . Holy shit . 
Thanks for making me feel special with all the birthday love !! 
Play of my day : Blues Brothers , < PROPFIRST > McCartney , Firefly wakeup at 10:30 AM , icecream for breakfast , a whole pizza to myself at Grimaldi's , Tiramisu from Eataly for my birthday cake , Nerds and < PROPFEMALE > wheat pitchers @ < PROPMALE>'s Dilemma . Excited to see what else the night brings . :) 
5 hours in and still just starting this cold , wet , rainy day sitting on the sidewalk outside the apple store ... 
It's a perfect day for taking a walk and getting lost . <3 
They must put crack in < PROPMALE>'s cheesecake . 
I <3 my job !! 
My favorite part of pouring a Giunness is watching the ripple . 
I still want fried okra . 
Looks like I'm coming back to Oxford to visit this Summer . :) 
In the midst of getting drowsy after a bout of insomnia . It's strange when you think about it , the need to sleep . Our heart keeps beating , our mind is active ... What's it all for ? Recharging ? How does that happen ? Why ? 
Pizza and pickles for breakfast . :) 
Afternoon tea with my < PROPFEMALE > . <3 
I am sick and tired of reachimg up to grab boogery rails on the subway . This is the third time it's happened . Disgusting . :P 
Beer and pancakes , graced by the lovely company of < PROPFEMALE > Ferguson Read . :) Thanks for such a great day .
