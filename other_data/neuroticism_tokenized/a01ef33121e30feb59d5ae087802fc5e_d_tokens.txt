Love is feeling comfortable and safe with you , but still getting jelly-like when you walk into a room . \ 
Love is to trust enough to tell you everything about me , including the things I am ashamed of . 
The last five years as your hubby made for one epic adventure . Our kids will have left to start their own families , but you and I will still be together at the end of our days , sitting on the porch in our ponchos , waiting for the rain to start . \ 
Cheers !
