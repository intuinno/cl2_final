Is God willing to prevent evil , but not able ? Then he is not omnipotent . Is he able , but not willing ? Then he is malevolent . Is he both able and willing ? Then whence cometh evil ? Is he neither able nor willing ? Then why call him God ? ~ Epicurus ~ 341 BC - 270 BC

We are a lost generation , desperately clinging to anything that feels real , but too afraid to become it ourselves . We are a defeated generation , resigned to the hypocrisy of those before us . We are the last generation , a culmination of all previous things , destroyed by the vapidity that surrounds us . A culture so detached and disconnected that it has stopped giving birth to anything new . ~ Douglas Haddow , Poet 
I'm going to Citrus College . They accepted me(Like they wouldn't ) . I'm only starting w/ 3 classes . That way I can ease back into school , and I don't have any grants yet so I have to pay for it myself . I'm so excited . This is gonna be fun . 
You know what really sucks for me ? I live very close to the < PROPFEMALE > Bowl but tickets for the game are INSANE !! I've seen prices from $145 @ Ticketmaster for a nose bleed seat . To $ 4,000 @ StubHub for a Suite that up to 4 people can be in . And they don't even go on sale untill the 8th !! 
Oh yeah ....... GO DUCKS !!! 
Oh . I forgot to rub this in too ..... I'm watching the game in HD . Neener neener neeeeener !! :P 
Its not that the glass is half full or half empty . Its that the glass is just too damn big . All you need is a smaller glass . 
Wish me luck . I'm off to take my placement test . 
I rule !! I got about an 72% in math and 97% in english . 
Had a great time tonight w/ < PROPFIRST > . Went to a bar where a friend was DJing . Then went to a gay bar and got hit on by every guy there . It was awesome . 
I just sent everyone a invite for IsAnyoneOutThere . I'm talking to one of the founders of the site , on the site . The site just opened this week . Its a really great concept . Defenatly worth looking at . 
Should I call her and say hi ? Should I tell her I miss her ? I wonder if she thinks about me .... 
I'm off to register for classes . Wish me luck ! 
We must conduct research and then accept the results . If they don't stand up to experimentation , Buddha's own words must be rejected . -- Tenzin Gyatso , 14th Dalai Lama , 1988 
I just want you all to know .... You were WRONG !!! I called her . She misses me as much as I miss her . So HA !!!

Its like a big dish of succulent awesome smothered in a < PROPMALE > creamy awesome sauce . 
Please put this on your status if you know someone ( or are related to someone ) who is an idiot . Idiots affect the lives of many . There is still no known cure for stupidity , but we can raise awareness . 93% wont copy and paste this , mainly because they're too stupid to know how to copy and paste . Will YOU make this your status for at least one hour ? 
I don't want to sound like an asshole , but .... If people put their faith in other people and not into an imagineary being with the properties of < PROPFEMALE > Clause and the Easter < PROPFEMALE > , we would be in a much better place than we are now . 
I want to share with everyone that I gots me a B- on my second essay . WoOt !! Tomorrow is my mid-term . Eeek !! 
I want to apologize . I told people I'd find out about my mid-term tomorrow , I'll find out on Monday . 
You fucking rock . Did you know that ? Well I did . 
Ok . I got my mid-term back to day and I did alot better than I thought I would . I got a B . Not too bad if I say so myself . 
Do we really have to ask to know what the Urban Dictionary has to say about my name ? I didn't think so .... 
Winter term is done . I wonder when I'll find out my grades . I have about a week of rest and then the real fun begins . Spring term . 
My classes right now are ; Photography , Music Fundamentals , Voice , Sociology - Family , Marriage and Intimate Relationships , Philosophy/Logic , and Political Science . I know its alot . I'll probably drop either photography or political science . Probably photography . 
I dropped Photography . I had too many electives and it was in the morning . Now I can sleep in ... if it were possible ... 
I need some advice . How do you talk to someone who doesn't speak or understand much English ? Should I learn some Japanese ? 
Ah , morning . I love the stillness of the air . And the chirping of the birds . So peaceful . 
All Guys named < PROPFIRST > are totally freakin ' awesome . All guys named < PROPFIRST > are devilishly good looking , Therefore , everything totally freakin ' awesome and devilishly good looking are guys named < PROPFIRST > . Logic , an epic win every time .

I'll have my glasses in 7-10 days . They cost $500 . The frames were only about $70 , they are the bendy kind . I need bifocals , so I got the no line ones , and I got Transitions cause my eyes don't like the sun . 
Has become of the four eyed variety . 
Word to the wise .... Never get into a fight with a mountain . It will win . 
To whom it may concern : I'm sorry I keep Facebook open all the time . It makes it appear that I'm sitting at my computer when , in fact , I am not . Thank you and have a great afternoon . 
Happy Egg Day Peoples !

10 days till Vegas baby !! 
I have Txt now . So if anyone wants to get my number , let me know . For those of you that already have it ... I'll be expecting you . 
Just got back from Vegas . All in all I lost about $140 . There were 2 different times where I turned $20 into about $100 at the roulette table . But then I gave it all back , go figure . I really want to go back and wander around more , I could spend hours just looking at everything . Gambling is just a plus . 
Wednesday , June 9 , 2010 is International F*ck-A-Friend Day . ;) Really ... Would I make up something like that ? 
I want a girlfriend . Well , I don't even need me one of those , a cute female to cuddle with will do just fine . I just miss being close to someone ... 
Had a fun day . Good friends , free food and softball . What more do you need ? 
DEPRESSION is not a sign of weakness - it < PROPFEMALE > sign that you have been trying to be strong for too long . Put this on your status if someone you know has suffered from depression . Will you please post it & leave on your status for at least an hour ? Most people won't , but it's mental health week and 1 in 3 people will suffer from it at some point in their lives .

I don't know what I did to my shoulder/neck/arm but its been hurting for the last 3 days . 
HAHA .... I just saw a city bus hit a cop car that had someone pulled over . 
It doesn't take a reason to love someone , but it does to like someone . You don't love someone because you want to , you love someone because you are destined too . It's because you fall in Love with them , that you then try to find a reason , but you always come up withthe answer , No reason . 
Where's the love people ? 
Another night of class begins .... 
Well , I finally have a real bedroom ..... for now ... 
I love all the B-day wishes , but its not until tomorrow .....

Oh , Power Point ..... its time I get to know you . We have 4 days to spend together and I want to make the most of it by exploring your nooks and crannies . Then I will work my magic and < PROPFEMALE > at our wonderful creation . 
Ever have a cute friend you like ? And then you kiss and its like kissing a cute cousin ? Its quite depressing . But what am I gonna do , bitch ? I think not . :) 
I just had a really random thought ... \ 
\ 
2 brothers . < PROPFIRST > Body and < PROPMALE > Body .... \ 
I'd like to find them , meet them , shake their hands , and then slap their parents . :) \ 
Yeah .... Thats pretty random .... 
I feel like crap .... 
I'm always looking for something to put on failbook . Come on people , don't let me down . :) 
I'm sweating !! Sweet .....

I tried sleeping . I woke up at 4 after tossing and turning for 4 hours with one of the knarlyiest earaches I've had in awhile . Its just now starting to feel better . 
Term - 455 out of 654 = 70% C\ 
Not to bad . A B would have been better but I didn't do any of the homework , so I can't bitch . 
Damn .... this is the slowest 15 minutes ever . I just want to register ..... 
Sweet , got the classes I wanted . 
You're so vain , I bet you think this post is about you . Don't you ? 
I can't believe I have another 2 weeks to sit around and wait . I remember summer being cool . Now it's just ... inconvenient . \ 
I'm so bored , I'm trying to talk my Dad into letting me put a pond in his yard or cut down a juniper tree or 2 . Hell , at this point I'd even rototill the yard and lay fresh sod ... 
Mind the threefold law ye should , three times bad and three times good . \

Blessed Be to thee . 
I'm an UNCLE !! My little brother is a Dad , weird . 
I need to find something else to take pics of . But I have a lot of spiders in my yard .... 
First day back to school went pretty smoothly . :) 
If you guys haven't noticed , I haven't been on facebook alot lately . I want to keep my focus on school and the internets distract me . I do miss hearing from all y'all . So , text me . And if you don't have my number , ask and I'll gladly give it to you . :) 
I'm bored . Who wants to do something tonight ? Anything . Maybe even tomorrow , I'm free . 
Trust me , I want twits that twittle . 
Is all the work done by children ? \ 
No , not the whipping . 
I didn't slap you . I high-fived your face . 
I know I should be thankful but it feels like I'm taking an astronomy class for 3rd graders . 
During the whole of a dull , dark and soundless day , in the autumn of the year , when the clouds < PROPMALE > oppressively low in the heavens , I had been passing alone on horseback , through a singularly dreary tract of country , and at length , as the shades of the evening < PROPFIRST > on , found myself within view of the melancholy House of Usher . 
That was awesome ... \ 
I'm sitting , here drinking my coffee , then BAM !! A bright white light fills the air followed directly by the sound of the sky being ripped apart . As I step outside the sky opens up and the downpour starts . Just then , a second burst of light and sound erupts more intense than the first , the power goes and the silence falls . And just like that , it was over . 
Disneyland today . :) 
Step by step . Heart to heart . Left , right , left . We all fall down . Like toy soldiers . 
Who is doing what today ? Can I come ? :) 
What a boring day today was ... 
I like ' em little and cute , with enough room to shove a lot of stuff into . :) 
Today is going to be filled with sausage , beer , and chicken hats . I love October ... 
At The Alpine Village . It starts at 6 . Come find me !! :) 
Good night .... 
Soon it'll be 10/10/10 10:10:10 and then again in the pm . Pretty cool ... :) 
Wow .... \

No way .... \ 
Really ? \ 
Really . \ 
Damn ... \ 
But I wear 34 and a med . shirt . \ 
Kinda .... \ 
Shut-up . \ 
Make me .... \ 
Conversation I had with myself about 5 minutes ago .... 
These happy random meetings we keep having are just not cutting it . I constantly find myself scanning the crowd for your face . Visiting the places we've encountered each other , hoping you'll take the same path again . I've made up my mind , its time to declare my intentions . 
This may be the last thing that I write for long . Can you hear me smiling when I sing this song for you and only you . 
Extra strength audio reboneification . 
Can you smell that ? The coffee is done . I love it when the coffee is done . 
Had my CPR/First-Aid midterm and my Astronomy midterm today . Did awesome on the former and I think I did ok on the ladder . 
I hate alot of whites and I hate alot of blacks . I hate poopin ' in public places , but we all hate that . I hate lesbian feminists cause they're all so damn ugly . I hate super-models too cause they'll never ever want me . And I hate Regis , and I hate < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > . I hate every single movie by that midget Spike < PROPFIRST > . 
\Ahoy ! sissy . What you got in your mouth sissy ? \ " - Earlameyer the Butt Pirate " 
Goodnight FB . I'm dragging my sad , lonely ass to bed . Catch ya in the AM .

Goodnight world . 
Should I keep the goat or get rid of it ? ( We're talking about face hair here ... ) 
Second time in a row I've forgot to do my Astronomy homework ... 
Remember ..... \ 
Ceiling Cat watches you . 
would really like to go to The Land with a certin someone , but has to set up for a party that someone can't make it to ... 
Please , join me in putting this in your status if you or someone you love has been eaten by velociraptors . It's time to let everyone know that there is no shame in being ripped limb from limb and gobbled up for vicious sport . Velociraptors are , after all , kind of ... unstoppable . Together , we can make a difference . 
Damn it !! I lost The Game . 
madness .. Madness ... MADNESS !!! 
Good Morning :) \ 
Party went pretty good . I had alot of fun . Slept more comfortably than I have in awhile . ;) 
We haven't had ONE person knock on the door tonight ... 
There .... are .... FOUR ... lights !! 
I'm Like Gossamer , the big red hairy monster from the < PROPMALE > the Martian cartoons . I overwhelm , smother and scare those I want to be around the most . Then , as they run in fear , I sit wondering what I did wrong . 
Stuck at school untill 10 today and tomorrow . Happy happy , Joy joy ... 
Really .... why am I still up ? 
Who wants to take me to The Land this weekend ? I don't have a way to get there . :( 
Ok . I'm going to Disneyland this weekend regardless . I really don't want to go by myself but I will if I have to . I might even go saturday AND sunday cause I'm that awesome . :)

In reviewing music for The Christmas Show I rediscovered something I've always known , Christmas music is EPIC . :) 
I'd like to give a shout out to all the people that weren't cool in high school . \ 
You're awesome . ;) 
I'm bored ... 
Who's doin ' what today ? Me , I'm cleanin ' the house . After that I want to get out of the house . Might go see a movie or wander aimlessly around the mall or both . :) Anyone wanna tag along or have a better idea ? 
Has anyone tried the RockMelt browser ? I'm thinking about giving it a try . 
Ok , I'm trying out RockMelt . We'll see how it goes . If any of you want to try it I have 3 invites for the beta testing . And if you don't know what i'm talking about , look it up and get back to me . :) 
Carpe diem , quam minimum credula postero . 
Well hello there Facebook , in my hands . :) 
All day long my face has been glued to the app store and I've been up since 3:30 . I think it might be time to go to sleep now ... 
It's funny , I haven't even touched my computer at all for the last 2 days . Except only to plug my touch in . It's official , I'm an addict ... 
Your Class for registration purposes is Sophomore . \ 
Sweet .... 
For those who care --- Right now the app for the game Driver is free right now . \ 
I think it cool anyways .... 
I like Facebook on my iPod a whole lot better . Come to think of it , I haven't really used my computer for almost a week . My little 14\ laptop screen looks so huge now ... :) " 
I'm bored . Someone text me or something or email me or IM me ... 
I got stuck in line for an hour at Kmart behind 2 Armenian ladies while they had the checker price-check each and every item . Over $450 worth of cheap purses , cheap shoes , cheap earrings and underwear . 
Did you catch the epic episode of Community ? Its was Christmastastic !! :) 
To all of you in Christmas Is ... That was awesome ! :) 
If you can't tell , I just went thru my YouTube subs . Don't worry people , I'll post the pictures today . Before the first performance , I promise . 
Calm down people , its only finals . What could go wrong ? :) 
Damn it all to hell !! I went months , MONTHS !! without losing The Game and I've now lost it at least 5 times in the last 4 days . \ 
You just lost too .... \ 
The Game 
Got an A on my Sociology final . :) Now , lets see what it does for my grade ..... 
HOLY SHIT !!! \ 
I just got an e-mail from my Sociology teacher about my grade . I'll just repost it here ... \ 
Peter , \ 
\ 
Your total points came to 194 which is a D , and yes , 6 points from a C . But you always attended class , and participated , so I bumped it to a B . \ 
FUCK YEAH !! 
Who's doin what after our performance ? Anyone wanna go somewhere afterwards ? We should get a big group together and go eat or something ... Alot of you are under 21 , so a drink or 2 is out of the question . 
Thanks to Rissa < PROPFEMALE > I got a class for winter term , Speech 100 :) 
Should I get up off my ass and put lights on the tree ? 
Stupid rain . I wanted to see the eclipse that starting RIGHT NOW !! 
To all those who care to know .... Grades are out on BlackBoard . My GPA for the term is 2.87 :D 
Ok ... I'm over winter break . This whole sitting around the house thing is getting old . I'm about ready to clean and reorganize the garage .... 
Dude .... if you have an iPod or an iPhone .... SoundHound just updated and now you get free unlimited song IDs . I don't know about the one on the android market . But if you know what I'm talking about .... its kind of a big deal .... 
I'm excited to see you guys tomorrow . :) 
What am I doing tomorrow ? 
Damn , I just had 31 people in my chat . I think that might be a record . Whats your record ? 
What do you guys think happened to the 3,000 red winged blackbirds and the 100,000 drum fish that mysteriously died in Arkansas ? I've read that everything from lightning , diseases , tectonic activity , even secret testing of a poison gas . But all these explanations leave out one < PROPMALE > detail , it happened to only one species of bird and fish . Quite odd ... 
I did some more reading on bird and fish deaths around the world ... \ 
There were over 500 red winged blackbirds with a handful of starlings found dead just outside Baton Rouge . \ 
There were hundreds of thousands of dead fish in Chesapeake Bay . \ 
AND ... \ 
There were about 100 tons of sardines that washed up on the shores Parana in Brazil . \ 
Something is going on .... 
Hey guys ... Find and add me ... \

Vernacularism to your female parental unit . Proclaim to her my salutations . Serenity be with you upon your exit , my non-blood related male kin . 
It's not enough to bash in heads . You have to bash in minds .

Pursued by the goodness of mankind hither and thither - which I as little want to deserve as I deserve it - Humility of man towards man - it pains me - and when I consider myself in relation to the universe , what am I and what is He - whom we call the greatest - and yet - herein lies the divine in man -- Ludwig < PROPFIRST > Beethoven ( Immortal Beloved ; Letter #2 ) 
WARNING PLEASE READ - if someone comes to your front door and asks you to remove your clothes and dance with your arms in the air , DO NOT do this , it is a scam , they just want to see you naked . Please copy and paste this to your status .
