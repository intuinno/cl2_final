Status : At a moral crossroads ... Which path should I take ? To be happy ? To be Vengeful ? Or , should I stick with my gut and do what I feel is right , despite the warnings and naysayers ? The Answer should be clear ... yet , I find it to be hazed over .

Me behave ? Seriously ? As a child I saw Tarzan almost naked , < PROPFEMALE > arrived home after midnight , Pinocchio told lies , Aladdin was a thief , Batman drove over 200 < PROPMALE > an hour , Snow White lived in a house with 7 men , Popeye smoked a pipe and had tattoos , Pac Man ran around to digital music while eating pills that enhanced his performance , and Shaggy and Scooby were mystery solving hippies that always had the munchies . The fault is not mine ! If you had this childhood and loved it , repost 
(: D )) 
THIS ! This is what we need in the store I work at ... maybe that'll teach the little fuckers http://www.damnlol.com/show-no-mercy-1655.html 
Can't catch a single damn break ... Let it be known , just how much I truly despise that pathetic little man known ... 
96% of the people who read this will not have the guts to repost this . One man gave his life in order to save ours . When Goku died in the explosion with Cell , he thought of both you and me . If you are part of that 4% that doesn’t feel ashamed to love Goku , repost this . Thank you Goku . Repost this if you are one of the 4% who DID lift their arms for his Spirit Bomb . I know I did . 
Please copy and post this as your status , even if its just for a few minutes , if you know someone who is still alive today because you can't afford a hitman .
