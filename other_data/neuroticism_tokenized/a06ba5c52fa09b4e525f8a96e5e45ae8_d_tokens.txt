Being a self-employed , stay-at-home Mr. Mom is friggin ' awesome , but it comes with its downfalls ... motivation , the fact that sometimes housework * IS * more important , motivation , all that beer staring at you every time you open the fridge ... and did I mention motivation ?

FOR THOSE WHO KNEW < PROPMALE > HERTZBERG : I hate to do this via Facebook , but ... < PROPMALE > passed away quietly this morning on his mom's couch . I will let everyone know more as I get more info . 
And then ... depression set in . 
trusts people far too easily ... dammit ... 
is wondering why sometimes his FB status updates and sometimes it doesn't when I type something new via my iPhone FB app ... 
What is it about me that always attracts some kind of friggin ' drama ? 
This space for rent ...

Heavy sigh 
Just when life is starting to make sense and settle down and you think you have control of everything ... WHAMMO !!! And I don't mean the toy company that makes frisbees and Slip n ' Slides ...

Just read my daughter's Progress Report tonight , and with the exception of < PROPMALE > , she got her first straight A Report Card ! Hmmm ... maybe it's not such a bad thing that they're thinking of eliminating < PROPMALE > class from MPS ... ( I'M KIDDING ) 
Okay , for everyone that knows me and/or has known me since high school , you know that I am not a prude when it comes to music . But \Detachable Penis\ " ? Have you heard this song ??? Could these guys find nothing better to write about ? " 
has proven that you can piss away a good hour and a half of your morning on Facebook and suddenly realize that your daughter will be late for school because of it ...

Happiness is discovering that your seven-year old daughter still isn't too old to snuggle with her daddy ... I couldn't have asked for a better start to my day .

Just found out that today is National < PROPFEMALE > Wars Day ... May the Fourth Be With You ... 
Another cold , rainy , gloomy day ... Just perfect for the mood I'm in . 
First I discover today that my 1st grade daughter needs glasses . Then I realize that we're probably going to have to put our female dog down . Add to that the fact that my daughter has turned into an overtired , whiny , unlistening mess , I got some bad news from my own doctor today and my soup just exploded in the microwave ... can life get any better ? I submit that it cannot . 
has decided that today is officially National \Stick It In Your Ass\ " Day ... " 
loves the fact that he can STILL recite Ghostbusters line for line almost 25 years later . 
Even the < PROPMALE > teacher relented this quarter ... < PROPFIRST > GOT HER FIRST STRAIGHT A REPORT CARD !!! 
18 HOURS `TIL SUMMERFEST , BABY ... YEAH 
A ribeye , marinated and rubbed with my own special blend of sauces and seasonings , grilled to perfection , and an ice cold Newcastle . Can life get any better ? 
How many of us really know everybody on our Friends list ? I don't normally do this stuff , but ... I'd like all of my FB friends to Comment on how you met me , no matter how it happened . After you post , you can copy this to YOUR status if you want . Might be interesting ... 
Day Six of my Unintentional Sleep Deprivation : this morning I will see if I can tap into the part of my brain that controls Telekenesis , or possibly even Astral Projection . Or , maybe I'll just make some pizza rolls . 
Ate dinner , took a nap , took several Ibuprofen ... I think I'm ready . BRING ON < PROPFEMALE > COSGROVE !!! ;) 
Okay , I'm sorry ... but as cool as it may sound , does Miller Park REALLY NEED a 5,900 square foot HD scoreboard ??? Do we really want to be able to see every ingrown hair on < PROPFIRST > Hart's face ? No wonder the cost of beer and other concessions is going up AGAIN ...
