A true friend doesn't care if you're broke , you're slightly mental at times , you can't keep a secret , your house is a mess , or your family is filled with crazies ... they love you for who you are . A true friend can go long periods of time without speaking and never question their friendship .

Most people have 1000 wishes for This Holiday Season ; a cancer patient only has one , to get better . I know 97% of you won't repost this to your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do . In honor of someone who has died , or is still fighting , or survived cancer , copy this to your status 
God saw you getting tired and a cure was not to be . So he put his arms around you and whispered come with me . With tearful eyes we watched and saw you pass away . Although we love you dearly we could not make you stay . A < PROPFEMALE > heart stopped beating , hard working hands at rest .. God broke our hearts to prove to us , he only takes the best . Put as your status if there is someone in Heaven you will miss this Christmas 
Please remember this Christmas , while you are eating dinner and laughing , that in another house there is an empty chair where a hero should be sitting . They gave their life so that you can be with your family , so light a candle this Christmas for our fallen heros that did not make it home and for those still serving in Iraq , Afghanistan , or elsewhere . Repost this as your status to show your respect for our troops 
Greatest man in history named Jesus , had no servants , yet they called Him Master . Had no degree , yet they called Him Teacher . Had no medicines , yet they called Him Healer . He had no army , yet kings feared Him . He won no military battles , yet He conquered the world . He committed no crime , yet they crucified Him . He was buried in a tomb , yet He lives today . Re-post if you believe Jesus is the reason for the season ! 
< PROPFEMALE > CHRISTMAS FROM MY HOUSE TO YOUR 
Ok so haven't been able to say this yet but Happy New Year to all those who are actually having a good one , my on the other hand not so good . 
Rundown on 2011 for me so far . 1/1/11 cops scare the shit out of me b/c dad set off the alarm and i had a truck full of shit dropping it off at moms . 1/2/11 spend the night in the er with my grandmother in law . 1/3/11 aidan and < PROPFIRST > both sick vomitting everywhere . Now I am up to my ears in dirty laundry . kinda scared to go sleep not sure what tomorrow will bring 
Keep this going !! Heavenly Father , as we embark upon this new year , walk through my home and take away all my worries and any illnesses ; and please watch and protect my family and friends . In Jesus name , Amen . This prayer is so powerful , stop what you're doing & set this to your status ! All things are possible with GOD 
Your son will hold your hand for a short time , but will hold your heart for a lifetime ! It's sons week ; repost if you have a son who touches your heart 
I've carried a child within my body . Slept with my baby on my chest . I've kissed boo boos and mended broken hearts . I've been puked on , peed on , and spent sleepless nights in the rocking chair . But I wouldn't have it any other way . My body isn't magazine perfect , but when I look in the mirror I see a MOM , and there is no greater honor or blessing !! Post this as your status if you are proud to be a Mom !!! 
If your mom is or was your hero , your best friend , or just the best mom ever , if you're blessed to still have your mom or if she's an angel in heaven , paste this to your status and let everyone know you're proud of your mom , and that you love her dearly . You can replace a lot of people in life , but you only have one mom ! What an honor to be a mom and be called mom !

This year we will experience 4 unusual dates .... 1/1/11 , 1/11/11 , 11/1/11 , 11/11/11 .... NOW go figure this out .... take the last 2 digits of the year you were born plus the age you will be this year and it WILL EQUAL TO 111 . Try it and see ! :) Yep ... I stole this from someone ! Thought it was pretty cool ! 
Kentucky just passed the best law ever .. to be on Foodstamps , Medicaid , or Cash Assistance for your children or yourself you have to pass a DRUG Test . Now every other state should do the same . If you agree re-post . People that work have to take a drug test so should they ... Repost if you agree !! 
This week we remember all babies born sleeping , or whom we have carried but never met , or those we have held but could not take home , or the ones who came home but could not stay . Make this your profile status , if you , or someone you know has suffered the loss of a baby . The majority won't do it , because unlike cancer , baby loss is still a taboo subject . Break the silence . In memory of all lost angels
