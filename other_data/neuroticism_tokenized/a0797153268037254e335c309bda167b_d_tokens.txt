Maybe not all friendships are meant to be saved . \ 
Maybe we're meant to spend a certain part of our lives with certain people \ 
-and move on- 
I pray you'll be our eyes , and watch us where we go , \ 
And help us to be wise , in times when we don't know\ 
Let this be our prayer , when we lose our way\ 
Lead us to a place , guide us with your grace\ 
To a place where we'll be safe ...

My poor heart , it's been so dark since you been gone \ 
After all , you're the one who turns me off \ 
You're the only one who can turn me back on \ 
My hi-fi's waiting for a new tune \ 
The glass is waiting for some fresh ice cubes \ 
I'm just sitting here waiting for you \ 
To come on home and turn me on \ 
Turn me on

just realised < PROPFIRST > put the across the universe soundtrack on my itunes .. my night is so much better . 
When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide\ 
And I stop and I turn and I go for a ride\ 
And I get to the bottom and I see you again\ 
Yeah yeah yeah ! 
My poor little potato is sick :( and so am i :( 
I love you for sentimental reasons 
When the sun sets around me my daydreams confound me \ 
And the long night surrounds me \ 
You turn me around 
I'm letting go 
Light up your face with gladness \ 
Hide every trace of sadness \ 
Although a tear may be ever so near \ 
That's the time you must keep on trying \ 
Smile , what's the use of crying ? \ 
You'll find that life is still worthwhile \ 
If you just smile 
Who has nothing to do tomorow morning and wants to give me a ride so i dont have to walk for 80 minutes ??? :D 
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas \ 
Just like the ones I used to know \ 
Where the treetops glisten , \ 
and children listen \ 
To hear sleigh bells in the snow 
Happy Birthday < PROPFIRST > 
At the end I answer to one god \ 
It comes down to one love \ 
til ' I get to heaven above \ 
I've made the decision \ 
Never to give in \

It takes a night to make it dawn\ 
And it takes a day to make you yawn brother\ 
And it takes some old to make you young\ 
It takes some cold to know the sun\ 
It takes the one to have the other\ 
And it takes no time to fall in love\ 
But it takes you years to know what love is\ 
It takes some fears to make you trust\ 
It takes those tears to make it rust\ 
It takes the dust to have it polished 
Check it , check it , check it\ 
Now this is just an introduction before\ 
I blow your mind\ 
The show is All of That and yes we do it all the time\ 
So sit your booty on the floor or in a chair\ 
Ground or in the air\ 
Just don't go no where\ 
Cuz everything we do\ 
It's all of that ! \ 
When entertaining you\ 
We all of that ! \ 
My posse and my crew\ 
So sit still cuz we're coming right back 
Change your FB profile picture to a cartoon from your childhood . The goal ? To not see a human face on FB till Monday , December 6th . Join the fight against child abuse & copy & paste to your status to invite your friends to do the same . 
My right blinker is freaking out and going double time , can someone please explain this to me ? 
The morning sun when it's in your face really shows your age\ 
But that don't worry me none in my eyes you're everything\ 
I laughed at all of your jokes my love you didn't need to coax\ 
Oh < PROPFEMALE > , I couldn't have tried any more\ 
You led me away from home , just to save you from being alone\ 
You stole my soul and that's a pain I can do without 
Every Who down in Who-ville , the tall and the small , \ 
Was singing ! Without any presents at all ! \ 
He HADN'T stopped Christmas from coming ! \ 
IT CAME ! \ 
Somehow or other , it came just the same ! 
Bahama Mama <3 
Woke up to < PROPMALE > screaming there was snow everywhere . Now getting ready to go out to play in the whole half inch of it . yippee ! 
Most people have 1000 wishes for Christmas ; a cancer patient only has one , to get better . I know 97% of you won't repost this to your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do . In honor of someone who has died , or is still fighting , or survived cancer , copy this to your status 
I was thinking that I might fly today\ 
Just to disprove all the things you say\ 
It doesn't take a talent to be mean\ 
Your words can crush things that are unseen\ 
So please be careful with me , I'm sensitive\ 
And I'd like to stay that way . 
apple cinnamon pancakes . yum . 
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye\ 
So you think you can love me and leave me to die\ 
Oh baby - can't do this to me baby\ 
Just gotta get out - just gotta get right outta here 
Occasionally\ 
my thoughts are brave and friends are few\ 
I cry out Lord what must I do\ 
I call up Master make me new\ 
You've got the love\ 
I need to see me through\ 
Sometimes I feel like\ 
Throwing my hands up in the air\ 
I know I can count on you\ 
Sometimes I feel like saying\ 
Lord I just don't care\ 
But you've got the love I need\ 
To see me through 
Looks like its gonna be a white christmas

Ian : Mama , What hapens if you break a promise to Jesus ? Me : well , he would probably be sad , and disapointed in you .. you should never disapoint someone who loves you . Thats why you should always try to do the right thing , if you do , Jesus will send down blessings and great rewards . Ian : LIKE A BIG SHINY TROPHY WITH MY NAME ON IT ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!

Bright and early for the daily races\ 
Going nowhere , going nowhere 
Never be bullied into silence . Never allow yourself to be made a victim . Accept no one's definition of your life ; define yourself . ~ Harvey Fierstein 
I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing \ 
< PROPMALE > Cavalry choirs are singing \ 
Be my mirror my sword and shield \ 
My missionaries in a foreign field \ 
For some reason I can't explain \ 
I know Saint < PROPFIRST > will call my name \ 
Never an honest word \ 
But that was when I ruled the world

Oh , how the ghost of you clings ... \ 
These foolish things remind me of you .

No way November will see our goodbye\ 
When it comes to December it's obvious why\ 
No one wants to be alone at Christmas time\ 
And come January we're frozen inside\ 
Making new resolutions a hundred times\

And we'll both be safe ' til St. < PROPFIRST>'s Day 
so my son has created a fictional character in his sketch book . His name is \Hoomp . \ " he draws him over and over and sometimes he is \ " hoomp dirty\ " and sometimes he is \ " hoomp clean . \ " Truely wonderful the mind of a child is . " 
I guess what I be saying is there ain't no better reason\ 
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons\ 
It's what we aim to do , our name is our virtue\ 
But I won't hesitate no more , no more\ 
It cannot wait , I'm yours

DEADLY TERMS USED BY WOMEN : 1 . FINE : This is the word women use to end an argument when they KNOW they are right and you need to shut up . 2 . NOTHING : This means SOMETHING and you should be wary . 3 . GO AHEAD : This is a dare , NOT permission . DON'T DO IT ! 4 . WHATEVER : A woman's way of saying F*YOU ! 5 .

“Stress is basically a disconnection from the earth , a forgetting of the breath . Stress is an ignorant state . It believes that everything is an emergency . Nothing is that important . Just lie down . ” 
I hate to see you cry\ 
Lying there in that position\ 
There's things you need to hear\ 
So turn off your tears\ 
And listen\ 
Pain throws your heart to the ground\ 
Love turns the whole thing around\ 
No it won't all go the way it should\ 
But I know the heart of life is good 
WHATEVER !
