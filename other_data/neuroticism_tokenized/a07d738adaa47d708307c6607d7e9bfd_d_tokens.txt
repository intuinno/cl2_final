needs to get a grasp on time . 
feels that a part of her life is ending and being put away , in every single aspect of it . endings are good , because it means there will be new beginnings . now that this is coming to a close she feels a sense of relief .

Such weird dreams lately , I dig it . 
Sleeping too late makes my face hurt . 
I'm jealous of the people that get to go see Aesop Rock and Kimya Dawson . 
People be pissin ' me off . ALSO censorship !! Fuck that . 
I'm hardly in the yearbook at all . Why do you spite me , yearbook friends ? 
Writing my LAST final fundamental questions EVER . Woahhhh . ( I've written this status for pretty much every paper in my portfolio . ) 
I NEED TO BE PROM < PROPFEMALE > ! 
\can't you want to do something normal ?? \ " - my mom " 
Gay boyfriends are the best boyfriends ... Not that my boyfriend is gay . 
I don't trust iTunes .. 
\I felt very paranoid ... Like some kind of criminal skullsucker on the lam from Scotland Yard . \"" 
A creature ripped up my porch . Wtf ?

Where will all the martyrs go when the virus cures itself ? 
Today , I feel like an artist . 
Best night of my life ... Nothing matters after this !!!!! 
My nose keeps being stuffy .. 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > is sleeping like a sleepy baby , while I am sitting on the computer AWAKE AS FUX ! This is what I get for taking 4 hour naps in the middle of the day . 
I <3 my bbii < PROPFEMALE > . I also <3 hott boyzz that work at french brunchaurants . 
I love my Spenny T < PROPFEMALE > , he feeds me sushi and drives me home . 
I don't think its very nice to walk around my head all night , you got me tangled me tangled like a bread tie twisted . I don't think its fair . 
Right before my eyes I saw the whole world lose control , I couldn't take it anymore . I fell through the floor , I couldn't take it anymore , I saw the whole world lose control , uh-huh . 
Technically I am done , however , the whole ' no more high school thing ' kinda loses its lightening-punch when you have to return for the next two days for various school related tasks ... =/ 
Got my darling car back today . Thank god . <3 
Time for some babytown baby-grillin . 
I can't remember if I took my sleep easy or not . 
Apparently today was really pretty and I was much too asleep the entire time . 
Goodbye FOREVER .

You don't punch a lady , even if she looks like Snooki .

I don't like when bitches at the theatre that tell you to be quiet , but they do it louder and bitchier and with more noise than you ever made in the first place . \ 
Also being shushed . Same vein , worst thing ever . 
Old computers and iTunes can S my D . 
Alright aiight aite okay . I'm done with this shyt . I'm gonna go READ . Eff computers . 
Laudrying , packing , saying goodbye for a bit . =/ WOAH .

Days full of vicodin , kielbasa , and Ru < PROPFIRST > - pretty good . 
Sometimes I think \I have way too many pictures of myself on facebook . \"" 
I LOVE MY MOMMY !!

Definitely feeling fall . Comforting and beautiful , but a little sad . 
Just watched Tinkerbell with < PROPMALE > and Ronin . Must say , it was a great film . I teared up a little . 
Sometimes I feel bad about all my Tumblr posts ... 
I feel like I should start brushing my teeth in the middle of the day too . 
I am not good at ironing and I miss the dark room . 
Heyyyoooo , good lookin boyzz in Seattle . Holla . 
Ru-roh . Slightly stranded at ACT . Shoulda taken up the ride offers , huh ? 
I like my men short and scruffy . In other news , I give up ! HA .
