Friend who's enough of an enabler to comment on ( and therefore re-enforce the behavior of posting ) the most inane and attention-whoring drivel says what ? 

I have a functional PC . \ 
I have a functional PC . Just saying it makes me all tingly . Say it to yourself . Go ahead . Roll it around in your mouth . Swish it through your teeth . Mmm . Good , right ? \ 
\ 
Well , time to become a total social networking whore . 
is gearing up for Friday ! \ 
Whoo ! \ 
[ /sarcasm ] 
That's it , guys ! WE ARE ALL GOING TO BE GEARED UP FOR FRIDAY ! \ 
It's gonna be like Friday-palooza up in this bitch ! \ 
... also , if you see < PROPFEMALE > , tell him his family would like to know which state he's in . 
The amount of surety I demand from the knowledge of the contents of my sandwich is as close to requiring metaphysical certitude as I come to in this life . 
I've been thinking about mobius strips a lot recently . \ 
They just give me the shivers . 
Fuck yeah , Sister Act ! \ 
... also , whiskey . That's cool , too . 
I'm mostly shaven now . I'm sure my head would feel lighter if not for the EGREGIOUS amount of hair that's on top of it .

This is a short ( and by no means all inclusive ) list of things that are inappropriate to call the people with whom you are negotiating a business transaction . \ 
Stop it . 
Damn you , Final Crisis ! Everything in you SOUNDS so awesome when described out of context ! \ 
WHY DO YOU SUCK SO HARD !? 
Aside from a twenty to thirty minute stint when I was too young to understand it , I just watched Con Air for the first time . \ 
Now , I've loved movies before . I've reveled in them . I've been baptized by them . On a few distinct occasions I've considered forming a deep , meaningful relationship with a movie . Getting to know it , bit by bit . \ 
What I feel for Con Air , however is just .... indecent . 
Guys , this is real simple :\ 
If you're ordering a salad then you need to know what kind of dressing you want . It's gonna come up . Don't act shocked when the person taking your order asks you . If you're ordering for someone else , and they want a salad , find out what dressing they want before you call . Don't let them wander off before the order is over either . You may need them to clarify or specify something . 
Do not ask the person taking your order what kind of salad dressing you should get on your salad . Act like an adult . Make a decision . \ 
Do not tell the person taking your order that you don't care what dressing you get , or try to have them pick . You are inconveniencing them with your laziness . \ 
Stop it . 
It's official . \ 
I'm legally a Laird now . \ 
You may grovel , but keep it classy . 
“Persons attempting to find a motive in this narrative will be prosecuted ; persons attempting to find a moral in it will be banished ; persons attempting to find a plot in it will be shot . By Order of the Author” - < PROPFIRST > Clemens , doin ' it big and keepin ' it real since 1835 . What ? 
Go out of your way to do something good tomorrow . Make sure nobody knows that you did it . \ 
That glowing feeling of self satisfaction you feel ? That's moral superiority . No , it's cool , it's supposed to feel like that . We've spent three thousand years developing an abstract system wherein we can make ourselves feel good by improving the quality of life for others without external compensation . Bask in the pay-off . 
< PROPFIRST > I : The final boss of Christendom . 
< PROPMALE > Augustus . \ 
\Who ? \ " \ 
\Errors of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it . \ " \ 
So ... apparently from 1209 to 1212 , the < PROPMALE > of England was excommunicate . \ 
.... huh . 
You know what the Jacobite's main problem was ? < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > was kind of a pussy and had no appreciable skill at centralizing leadership . \ 
Also rifles . They just ruin everything fun . 
When people tell you to be honest about your feelings , they mean that you should be honest with yourself . \ 
Seriously , just keep it to yourself . 
How are you ? How's it going ? How have you been ? \ 
None of these are greetings . \ 
Recognize . 
So the nun says , \Hermeneutics ? I've never even met her sister ! \"" 
\Contradictions do not exist . Whenever you think you are facing a contradiction 
It seems odd to me that I've done so much walking in my life and never had the opportunity to kick a dog . 
So < PROPFIRST>'s been kicking our asses in Tekken 6 as Kuma for a good long while now . \ 
We are all shamed and emasculated . 
You know when rappers being a like with the phrase \I don't\ " but they slur it a bit so that there isn't a ' d ' sound ? Would that be spelled \ " I'on't ? \"" 
You know how when someone dies on a space ship they always eject the body in a coffin ? \ 
... don't they have to store those on the ship ? \ 
Is there , like , an entire cargo bay stacked with empty coffins ? One for every crew member on board ? \ 
... are they already engraved with their names ? 
Paid rent , bought Cataclysm , renewed my tags , didn't leave the house\ 
Nice . 
So ... it's apparently Pokémon profile picture month . \ 
How about that . 
SoCo and Eggnog ? \ 
Yes please . 
Hippopotomonstrosesquipedalian . \ 
Autological grandiloquence for the win . 
Please , join me in putting this as your status if you or someone you love has been eaten or attacked by velociraptors . It's time to let silent victims everywhere know that there is no shame in being ripped limb from limb and gobbled up for vicious sport . Velociraptors are , after all , ... kind of unstoppable . 98% won't copy and paste this . 
Facebook ? I'm not looking at Facebook ! I'm gonna go play Cataclysm ! 
Hey , Kojiro Sasaki . Maybe you'd be less dissapointing as an antagonist if you weren't so damn fictional . \ 
Think about it . 
Two days of the kind of research you only see in movies . \ 
Ahhhhhh .... I need a brownie . 
Don't worry , we're going to win the first robot war . \ 
We're going to win the first three . \ 
After that though , we may be in trouble . 
I think my favorite moment is the roughly 3/4 of a second between when the flint hammers down and the payload discharges . \ 
It's a beautiful touch of peace in the middle of all that smoke and noise . 
So < PROPFIRST > says , \Thomas á Becket ? I thought he was a bishop ! \"" 
I'm now drunk enough to seriously consider doing a pod cast in which I discuss the idiosyncrasies of various grimoires . \ 
Thoughts ? 
Just got done soloing the Tomb of Horrors module . \ 
Praise me at will . 
is excited about Diablo III and Portal 2 all over again . 
< PROPFIRST > is working at Howie's right now . Here's hoping he doesn't ruin anything . 
At the bottom of my bag of peanut butter M&M's there was a chip of < PROPFEMALE > coating the size of a TicTac . \ 
Win . 
Dammit , Lost , I have shit to do . 
Holy crap ! If you post your password in a comment Facebook automatically turns it into asterisks ! ********** ! \ 
Sweet ! 
I've just spent an hour on YouTube trawling through communist Soviet propaganda . \ 
I feel ... inspired . 
< PROPFIRST>'s over there watching Sailor < PROPFEMALE > SuperS . \ 
What a queer . 
Wake up at 6:30 ? Check . \ 
Finish handout for D&D ? Check . \ 
Feel handicapped by lack of printer or ability to draw ? Double check . \ 
Alright . It's time to TPW a Naxx raid . 
I just finished filing my taxes with TaxACT , you can try it for free : http://budurl.com/TaxACTFB1 
My name is Kiel , I like penis nom nom nom ! 
I want my copy of fireworks to arrive . \ 
I want to produce things . 
I stuck my hand in a tea urn the other day . \ 
It was pretty boss . 
If someone you love has a learning disability or a sever speech impediment , or is five years old , then there's something you should know . \ 
STOP LETTING THEM ORDER THE PIZZA ! \ 
It's not cute and it's not fun . It's inefficient , annoying , pointless , and stupid . 
I'm about to go watch episode 17 of the new My Little Pony series Friendship is Magic . \ 
Having successfully rounded Eccentric Nerd hill on the Still Watches Cartoons Express , we are full steam ahead to Creepy Town , making all stops at Lonely Canyon , Man-Boy Basin , and Fort Shameless . \ 
ALL ABOARD ! \ 
* Toot * * Toot * 
\Attention to health is life's greatest hindrance . \ " -Plato . " 
So ... there's apparently a word for older , male fans of the new My Little Pony series ... \ 
Bronies . \ 
... what has my life become ? 
So ... I apparently just bought some of the best headphones known to man . \ 
.... sweet . \ 
Turtle Beach , you and I are going to like each other .
