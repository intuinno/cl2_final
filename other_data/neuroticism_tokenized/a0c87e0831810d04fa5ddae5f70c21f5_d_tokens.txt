I just made an account and began searching for friends and family . Facebook just notified me that I am adding friends too quickly and my account will be suspended if I continue . So , basically , they're blaming me for it being easy to find people . 
Facebook IM isn't working for me , for some reason . Use other means to contact me .

I should probably update my status , since it's been a few weeks . Insert blather here . 
I love flipping through the TV listings and suddenly stumbling upon the porno listings . \Busty Cops and the < PROPFIRST > of De\ " . Sounds like a classic archaeological adventure to rival Raiders of the Lost Ark . Look for it at the Oscars . " 
\That'd be like a supermodel inventing bacon . \ " -- < PROPMALE > Ferguson "

Wired says the Web is dead . This is despite the fact that , while traffic to other segments of the Internet is growing faster , traffic to the Web is still accelerating . Journalism : you're doing it wrong . 
A half hour in the dorm and I already want to get out of here . The connection is terrible , and bandwidth per week is rationed . 
The Nerdist Podcast revealed something amazing : < PROPFIRST > Bond is a Time Lord ! It explains everything ! 
I'm trying to nerd , but the people down the hall are jocking too loudly . 
Woah , I just broke philosophy : If you have nothing but unhappiness , then you can have nothing but hope that things will be better , thereby making you nothing but happy , meaning you have no hope for improvement at all , making you nothing but unhappy ... 
Today , my professor compared the writings of < PROPFIRST > de Montaigne to Pink < PROPMALE>'s The Wall . I can't wait till we get to the part where Montaigne gets delusional and sends out armies of goose-stepping hammers .

Taking heed of the words of Montaigne , I decided to something I have never tried before : watching football . The intro consisted of a COWBOY with a FULL BEARD playing an ELECTRIC GUITAR with lots of EXTREME CLOSEUPS . Oh god , what was I thinking ? 
I have lost my mind . I think it fell into the gutter . 
Best part of college so far : students who moved from far away getting freaked out by craneflies .

No matter how much work I have to do , it is impossible to not be happy while listening to \Come On Eileen \"." 
I always hated that my sense of humor only works reactively ; I can't think of jokes , I can only reply to things wittily . It just occurred to me that this is probably a good thing . I perpetrate enough smartassery as it is without being able to generate it from nothing . 
Please put this as your status if you know or are related to someone killed on Alderaan when it was obliterated by the Death < PROPFEMALE > . My wish is that people will understand the Empire is a band of murdering scum .

Will YOU make this your status for at least an hour ?

Looks like I'm going to drop a course . Thank GOD ! I should never have been in it . 
I despise those statuses that ask for personal validation in an entirely impersonal way by asking for comments or likes . Like this if you agree with me and think I am a smart person . 
For the past couple songs , Pandora has been playing me industrial rock covers of 80s synthpop songs . I did not know 1 ) that such a cover was possible and 2 ) that Pandora could get that goddamn specific . 
I was supposed to watch Firefly with friends tonight , but I know no last names and have no contact info , so I can't possibly coordinate with them to find out when and where . This is why I have no social life . 
< PROPMALE > & < PROPFIRST > are rarely funny , and never very much . I BAIT THEE , O TIM-AND-ERIC-LOVING TROLLS ! 
I just went down to check my laundry , and it finished the moment I took the last step to stand in front of the dryer ; this surprised me so much that I stumbled a little . It was staggeringly good timing . Literally .

I missed the voter registration due date . But then again , I wouldn't have voted anyway :P 
Listening to < PROPFIRST > F . Tompkins ' podcast ( the Pod F . Tompkast ) . My throat hurts from laughing so hard . 
When choosing a song to put in the ad that precedes each installment of the video series that I'm catching up on , do not choose \Centerfold\ " . That particular strain of crabgrass takes root in my mind easily enough when you don't pelt me with extraneous seeds . " 
Even now , the next year , when it is far behind me , I STILL can't get over how awful a book The Kite Runner was . 
You know those \likes\ " which are full sentences and clutter up people's lists of likes ? Am I the only one who finds it odd that not one of them uses proper grammar ? " 
We have the best setup we've had so far in our yard for Halloween this year . It's going to be amazing ! It makes me wish we had a third person to film the inevitable fleeing trick-or-treaters .

My status had noobspeak in it for too long . I had to replace it with this . 
You know how some people attach every < PROPFEMALE > little thing they say , no matter how secular it is , to their religion ? I want to see what happens if I try that with agnosticism . 
Guys , I think < PROPMALE > Jobs needs help ; he's been in denial for years . He insists that Macs aren't PCs . I don't know whether he thinks that they're not personal or that they're not computers , but either way , he's fallen out of touch with reality . 
So supposedly I have a reputation for slacking in one of my classes and then arguing with the teacher to get out of the consequences . I sneaked past the rumors and drama of high school , and the fuckers followed me . 
You know those fancy symbols and capital letters you can make with your keyboard ? They aren't put there to make your words prettier . @& ~~~~ T*H*I*S ( is ) _NOT_ {{ AcCePtAbLe }} 
It's sort of weird that nobody ever wreaks anything other than havoc . Why do we have a word that only ever takes one direct object ? It seems inefficient . 
Holy shit , I just realized : those people who use all capital letters and no punctuation aren't annoying spammers ... they're ancient Romans . 
I just saw a commercial advertising a pomegranate drink , using the < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > story with a pomegranate in place of the apple . The video consisted mostly of < PROPFEMALE > lying nude on her side with the snake slithering on her . I'm no Christian , but that still seems a little off . Satan is sexy and the capacity for evil is a selling point ? 
Thinking of pruning my friends list . There are a lot of people on it about whom I know nothing and with whom I have never had any contact . 
I should now by now that if Googling something leads me to Encyclopedia Dramatica , it's best to let it remain a mystery . 
For a while I've been asking myself whether I believe in a god and trying to come up with an answer . Then I realized that that's like asking myself who put the ram in the ram-a-lam-a-ding-dong ; the question comes from nothing at all , and there's no way to even begin answering it , so trying is just absurd . 
< PROPMALE > ? Hoi Nekroi Badizomenoi . 
So how many train-based action dramas is Denzel Washington planning on doing ? 
\Shit ! Why is mine never long enough ? \ " -- < PROPFIRST > Mathias " 
Sometimes I resent < PROPMALE > for inventing gravity . Then someone tells me that < PROPMALE > didn't invent gravity , but only discovered it . And then I laugh at them , because that would just be silly . 
You all know I'm pretentious and always in my head , right ? So writing philosophical aphorisms and tweeting them seems like the sort of thing I would do , right ? Right . \

Marble Hornets is about to post another entry ! I'm probably sleeping with my light on tonight . 
If the kid in that commercial I just saw is so poor that she doesn't even have clean water to drink , why is her white t-shirt absolutely pristine ?

Change your profile picture to a ZOMBIE and invite your friends to do the same ! The object of this is to NOT see any human face on Facebook but an invasion of fucking ZOMBIES to raise awareness to end Violence Against Zombies . 
Turns out I only need about 15 out of 35 total points on the two last papers in FYS to pass . Woot ! I was worried there for a while . 
The past 24 hours : 12 hours sleep , 2 hours gaming , 10 hours tomfoolery . Life is good . 
When I talk to myself , it's not schizophrenia ... it's a soliloquy . 
There's an eclipse tonight and I can't find the gorram < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Just watched a compilation of Marble Hornets ( part 1 ) on a DVD . Still thoroughly creeps me out .

Watching Fantastic Mr. Fox . Just got to the part with the obligatory lesson , where the animals have to band together and use their individual talents . The problem is that it was all about the natural talents they have due to their species . Good job , Dahl ; you've taught children racism .

I am making believe I'm sailing on the sea . I am making believe I'm captain of the Pea . 
ATTENTION EVERYONE : Your astronomical signs did not change , for several reasons . \ 
1 ) This change reflects how astronomers map the sky , not astrologers . A person's zodiac sign is an astrological thing . \ 
2 ) It was announced in 1930 , before most of you were born and got a zodiac sign . \ 
3 ) It's all bullshit anyway . 
I just noticed on the commercial that the chief ingredient of Lipozene ( a weight loss pill ) is something called \amorphophallus konjac\ " . That first word breaks down to mean \ " shapeless penis\ " . Let's hope this is no indication of its side effects . "

Sweet , LoL is coming out with a better disciplinary system for people who violate the game policy . Maybe soon people will be slightly less inclined to be absolute dicks on there and the game will actually be enjoyable . 
Am I the only one who starts to get a headache when people type in all caps for more than a few sparse phrases ? It's as if they are so very obnoxious that the text gains rudimentary telepathy and actually does shout at me . 
Why did the makers of < PROPFEMALE > Trek think that arranging ridges on human faces in various ways made them into believable aliens of DOZENS of different species ? In all the genetic diversity of an entire GALAXY , are we supposed to believe that every intelligent race is just a bumpy human ?
