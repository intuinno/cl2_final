Just read a little about Democritus and his atomic theory back in 300 BC . According to Vitruvius ' treatise on architecture , he heard about three basic theories on what everything was made of by physicists of his time . Thales thought water was the primary structure . Heraclitus conjectured fire was the basis of structural components . But Democritus was the one who was closes . Amazing !

Imagine a home built in the < PROPMALE > made out of the < PROPMALE>'s trees . Not cut down , but cut out and connected . Since those trees move and change over time , the change of nature changes the shape and size of the house .... like a shifting home .
