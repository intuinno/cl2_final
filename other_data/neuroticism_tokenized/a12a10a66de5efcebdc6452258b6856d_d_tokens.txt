Happy Solstice ! \ 
The solstice marks the time when the days begin getting longer again instead of shorter . It was an important marker for ancient cultures . If they still had more than half their stored food and wood , it was cause for feast and celebration , for they knew they had rationed enough to survive the winter . \
