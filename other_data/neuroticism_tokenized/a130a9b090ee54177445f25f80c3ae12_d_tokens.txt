Still awake after staying up three nights in a row . Just finished playing a game with one of my best friends . Texting people in bed while waiting for the restful blanket of sleep to envelop me . And we get our kittens tomorrow(today actually ) 

FUCK A RECESSION ! HAPPY NEW YEAR !!! 
Looking forward to going to sleep in a few minutes . First week of the second semester was fun , much less stress than last semester . Must finish this movie first though :'( 
Home with just the kitties , waiting for a response from a friend . About to go to sleep . 
Playing City of Heroes with < PROPFEMALE > . Irritated at lack of other members on the team . Also waiting on two friends to get their behinds over here . They were supposed to be here hours ago >> 
Irritated at the lack of response i'm getting via text messages . Everyone must be busy or something lol . 
Totally exhausted , but pushing it aside to get my studying done . Math , how you frustrate me ! 
Uploading the pictures from the pre-Prom photo shoot for all of you who don't have my old man on your friends list . 
Working with the kids in ceramics was so much fun ! :D I'm glad they came , hope they can come again soon ^^ 
Will be so happy to get out of high school . Looking forward to college and life outside of a boxed-in closed campus , and to spending more time with my friends and family . 
\My rage has purpose . I will hunt the Jedi ... and destroy the Galactic Republic . \ " - My new favorite SW quote " 
< PROPFEMALE > is on my mind <3 
Taking a quick break to go see how the lasagna is doing . I'm so hungry =( But at least i'm doing really well on my math studies for tomorrow ! ~ 
Wooooo ! Cant wait to go and party all night long ! Especially with christian having a shiny new xbox 360 and a shiny new Digimon Rumble Arena 2 . 
Off to the partay ! ~ 
Heading off to take my driver's test , then come back home and pack . Wish me luck ! 
Mood just went from carsick to lovesick . Decent day in general , but still annoying that i can't talk to specific people , since they were jacked by certain relatives . Going off to play Monster < PROPMALE > Tri . If any of you want to join me , feel free to respond . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > doesn't act , he replays stories of his life 
Apparently I am now a cheesecake ? 
About to go take a shower and head out to < PROPFEMALE > . Hopefully gonna finish all the paperwork today ! ^^ ; 
ALMOST done with that registration for my job . Now i'm just looking forward to Bass ' party . Too bad almost nobody is gonna be spending the night . 
Already finished with my little hw that I had . I think i'll absolutely love this semester . Looking forward to seeing all you < PROPFEMALE > College boys and girls around the campus =D Back to playing the Phantasy < PROPFEMALE > Portable 2 demo and watching Firefly =P 
????????????? - Feeling i'm getting right now 
At home , after classes today . Weight Training was killer , i think my abs will be back to their nice good old selves after this course =D And my arms are tired just lifting up . But it feels GOOD ! < (*w*)b Anyways , i'm off to set the table .... because apparently its my job . 
Took enough advil to completely nullify the soreness , and the painful scratchiness in my throat(from allergies ) . Tomorrow is 5 hours of work , 1 1/2 hours of class , and then my 4 DAY WEEKEND ! WOO ! Now i just have to figure out what to do . If I get my paycheck , i'll easily have enough to do with Valkyria Chronicles 2 =D

So , apparently < PROPFEMALE > thinks that music is more important than her brother D= How rude . 
Ugh my whole body is sore from my weight training circuit yesterday D= It's a good hurt in a way though , given that i'm slowly but surely getting stronger , bwahaha lol . 
Suck on my Mangekyou , world ! 
The longest day is one spent alone . Good thing i'm pretty much never alone ! =D 
FINALLY ! Note-taking is NOT one of my strong suits . Time for a nice cup of something-or-other and a bath with my newest book before I head to sleep . Though i might just take the easy way out and plop on the bed and conk out XD 
I'm sorry , but I don't speak Cactus Juice . 
Don't you just love when you think someone is interested in you , but that's just how they act to everyone ? XD 
Thursday(Today ): Get my paycheck turned into cash and geek out on Fallout : New Vegas and/or Retribution . \ 
Friday : Unraveling of the Fabric of the Universe from Noon on\ 
Saturday : Re-raveling of the Fabric of the Universe until around 4 PM . Then likely more Vegas and/or Retribution fun . \ 
Sunday : Free the whole day until , at 6 PM on , im at home doing chores inexcusably slowly XD 
I despise my complete lack of INT and WIS when i'm sick . Apparently gave away my gas discount receipt to Christian Nettel instead of the receipt needed to get my Fable 3 for me . Awesome . 
So ! I'm getting married to Christian Nettel , < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > C . Williamson , and < PROPFIRST > Caddy . God i love Fable 3 XD 
Kinda eh mall run . Got some shirts though . And a random wii game . Hopefully someone isn't busy lol . 
< PROPFIRST > Nott is annoyingly hard to get ahold of . So is Christian Nettel when his phone is off -.- 
Mental Note : Don't do Thanksgiving if you have weight training soon after . 
Anyone heard of Firefly and/or Serenity ? Besides the people that i've already indoctrinated that is lol . 
Come on , everybody now ! Change your display picture to your favorite pokemon ! Let's try to turn Facebook into a pokemon safari =D 
Losing interest at an alarming rate 
Dang it tonii , i want to see what pictures i'm in from all these alerts on my phone but i'm at school XD 
I know it's gonna end up badly , but should I try anyways ? 
HELL YES ! DONE WITH MY PD1 FINAL PAPER ! 3 minutes before , and it's just perfect =D 
So , any of you egg my car ? 
Has happily muted some people on Facebook . < PROPFIRST>'s annoyance level -50%

Has realized that combining a cold with a Mountain Dew Voltage doesn't help you focus . 
You and I wake up to the Zombie Apocalypse together . Using only 4 words , what do you say to me ? ( Note : If you comment , you must copy and paste this in your status so I can comment on yours . ) 
has an arm that hurts and a few scrapes . Totally worth it though . 
Overspecialize and you breed in weakness . 
Has discovered Tempura Maki . Delicious . 
Just wondering people , what are YOUR theme songs ? About your life , your love life , or even just a song that you really love . 
Queue up all my music , put on the awesome $80 headphones I found in my gaming cabinet , and start up Dragon Age . All at 12:53 AM . It's gonna be a LONG night . 
Happy Valentines day ! At least it's raining here XD 
What to do , what to do ... 
So apparently Christian is in a life or death battle with a < PROPFEMALE > pocket . I havn't decided who to support . 
Hates his phone for hating his friends . Too bad my bow's broken , or i'd use it as target practice . 
PSP died after only an hour and a half or so of play after being fully charged . Normal ? I think not . Now what'll i do after I finish my Psych test ? D=
