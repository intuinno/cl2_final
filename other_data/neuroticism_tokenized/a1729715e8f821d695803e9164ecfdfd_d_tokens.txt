looks in the mirror and doesn't see much . People tell me how smart I am and how ______ I am and etc , but I don't see it . Confidence is just a game we play , self-doubt and the unknown are the way of life . 
Can't we give ourselves one more < PROPMALE > , Why can't we give love that one more < PROPMALE > , Why can't we give love give love give love give love give love give love give love give love give love ' Cause love's such an old fashioned word And love dares you to care for The people on the edge of the night And love dares you to change our way of Caring about ourselves

When I find myself in times of trouble , I have no idea what to do . Sometimes I wish mother < PROPFIRST > would come to me , and speak those words of wisdom . 
is wondering if it is worth it . Is going through pain and hardship outweighed by the good times in life ? Or are we in just some cruel , biased and evil world ?

Dear Marple , you can have my locker after I'm done with it . Until then please direct any freshmen to the multiple empty lockers . I'm not moving my stuff to a new hallway which is so far away from my homeroom that it would guarantee me being late to Sloat . Thanks . \
