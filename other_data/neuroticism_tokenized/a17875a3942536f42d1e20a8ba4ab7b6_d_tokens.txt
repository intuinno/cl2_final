is glad she ate her ice cream last night , because the fridge/freezer apparently broke/died while she was at class -_- anyone have extra fridge space ? D; worried for the milk/yogurt that belongs to her roommates ( even if she never talks to them ) . wonder if they even know yet ? 
is changing her fb status just because her last one is no longer true :P also , she found \Otaku Culture and Contemporary Japanese Art\ " on the list of recent paper topics for her contemporary issues in < PROPMALE > class and was amused :D " 
is sleepy and class hasnt even started yet ;-; 
is reeeeeally kind of missing that one week before school started when she had her own room >.> is it selfish to be annoyed that her roommate didnt come back at all last night , then spends all day sleeping ? ( meaning , being forced to sit in the dark every time shes been in her room today since noon because shes nice enough not to open the curtains and wake her roommate up -_-) 
is going to make brownies , and be happy again xP ( and share them with other people too , of course ;O )

is freezingggg . its too cold for september ;-; 
is feeling pretty proud of herself for finishing a 25-question exam in 20 minutes in a u of i engineering course :D ( even if itll never happen again now that the html/javascript portion of the class is over ) 
is laughing at the random dude who yelled at her \stop scraping ur f***ing feet ! \ " and called her a \ " sea green bitch . \ " better to have blue/green hair than be a fugly asshole at least ? :P " 
is amazed . two weeks ago , on a saturday , she bought eggs . two days later , the fridge suddenly stops working . day after that , maintenance fixes the fridge . this past saturday , she bought eggs again . today , fridge has apparently suddenly stopped working . AGAIN . does the fridge have some kind of grudge against eggs or something ?? -_- 
is going to leave now ...... yeah ..... because sitting in here while her roommates male guest ( maybe probably her boyfriend ? ) lies around on her bed , while her roommate plays with his hair , is just a liiiiiiittle awkward ... 
is really hoping that she wont have to pull a pointless all-nighter , but she isnt about to go to bed while her roommates guest ( male , of course .... as always ) sleeps in the room . ( this is getting more and more ridiculous by the day ... ) 
is so confused ...... o_O its supposed to drop 10 degrees between tues and weds ??! what is this ?? D: stupid weather ...

is going to try really , really hard not to fall asleep in < PROPMALE > history today D; if she does , uhh .... its all < PROPFEMALE > Pabelonio's fault ! :P xD ( and maybe the novacaine from the dentist that hasnt completely worn off yet )

is drinking vanilla coke :) yummy . thank you < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > ! :D
