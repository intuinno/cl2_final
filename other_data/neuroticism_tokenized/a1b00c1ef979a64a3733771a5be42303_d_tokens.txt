Its party weekend in College Station ! We're having the Red Wine and Steak Festival . Not sure about the quality of the red wine -- but the men wandering around the festival are sure hot ! 

Just heard on NPR that the Blarney Stone was voted the \germiest\ " world attraction based on the number of people who've kissed it over the years . Not sure what this says exactly -- but it was still kinda interesting . " 
LOL ! More from NPR . A nude rugby game in New Zealand being held to celebrate National Nude Day was interrupted by a fully-clothed streaker . Officials were dismayed about the streakers lack of appreciation of the day . 
After 2 days of fireworks , I think I'm 4th of July'ed out for a bit . Love the pyrotechnical displays -- but both involved close to 4 hour waits in 100 * F plus heat -- and I'm worn out ! 
Up ealier than I'd like to be on a Sat -- but I want to get an early start to the day . Going to the local renaissance fair--it's Scottish Theme weekend -- so there should be lots of interesting sights to see ! Just imagine -- men in kilts all over the place ! Oh wait--it's a Renaissance Fair -- so I guess you should just say More men in kilts than normal ! 
Got a new phone yesterday-an HTC Inspire . Seems like a fun phone- but I hate the long learning curve on figuring out how these things work . 
Still-getting to watch the Muppet Show < PROPFIRST > from someone else's You Tube account is kinda fun ! And I finally found an AT&T phone that 
Gets FM radio ! The mustards usually block that so that you'll use their pay-for radio instead ! Now I can listen to the tv shows at the gym ! 
But-as you can see-I'M STILL having some minor problems with the predictive text ! :-)
