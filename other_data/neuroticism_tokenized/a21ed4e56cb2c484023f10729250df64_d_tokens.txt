im sick and i couldnt go to my band concert last night or go to school today ! it sucks ! 
Goin to a paramore concert Saturday ! :D 
That Paramore concert yesterday was awesome ! :D 
Be who you set out to be , not what others want to see ! :) 
I'm BORED :p 
FINALLY ungrounded :D 
NOOOO ! i was drawing a really awesome picture on the computer when i accidently closed the window :S I feel sooo stupid 
? You're my number one , You're my < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > . I look at earth from here , \ 
\ 
Still you don't seem so far\ 
But you will never know , Oh you will never know . \ 
Oh oh oh oh oooh oh oh , Oh I will never admit that I . \ 
I wish I could tell you how I feel , And show you what's inside of me is real . \ 
I dont know what I'm waiting for , I can't explain it anymore .? \ 
-My number one , paramore 
Oh < PROPFEMALE > fall down on me\ 
Let me make a wish upon you\ 
Hold on , let me think\ 
Think of what I'm wishing for\ 
Wait , don't go away . \ 
Just not yet . \ 
Cause I thought , \ 
I had it . \ 
But I forget . \ 
And I won't let you fall away , \ 
From me . \ 
You will never fade . \ 
And I won't let you fall away . \ 
You will never fade away from me . \ 
-Oh < PROPFEMALE > , Paramore 
? Well this is not your fault\ 
But if I'm without you\ 
Then I will feel so small\ 
And if you have to go\ 
Always know that you shine brighter than anyone does .? \ 
-Brighter , Paramore 
I'm soooo bored :p 
Was that math worksheet homework ??? ..... I hope not ..... 
? One day you'll get sick of saying that everything's alright . \ 
And by then I'm sure I'll be pretending , just like I am tonight . \ 
Please don't get me wrong\ 
Because I'll never let this go , but I can't find the words to tell you . \ 
I don't want to be alone , but now I feel like I don't know you .? \ 
-Never Let This Go , Paramore 
Watched the VMA's last night . Paramore didn't win anything :( Darn . 
When life gives you skittles , throw them at somebodys face and say \TASTE THE FREAKIN ' RAINBOW ! \"" 
My Sister = The most annoying person EVER :P 
When life gives you lemons , make grape juice . \ 
Then sit back and watch the world try to figure out how you did it . 
Some people are like slinkies ; not really good for anything but they\ 
still bring a smile to your face when you push them down a flight of\ 
stairs . :) 
We all learn to make mistakes and run from them with no direction\ 
We'll run from them with no conviction \ 
Well Now I'm told that this is life\ 
And pain is just a simple compromise\ 
So we can get what we want out of it\ 
Would someone care to classify , \ 
Of broken hearts and twisted minds\ 
So I can find someone to rely on 
EEEEW ! My sister is soooo weird ! She tried to LICK me ! XP BLECH no wonder why she doesn't have any NORMAL friends :) 
HAHA my brother must have been sleepwalking cause he walked into my room and we were like \Are you awake ? \ " and we snapped in his face and he turned around and walked back to his room . XD " 
We've learned to run from anything uncomfortable\ 
We've tied our pain below and no one ever has to know\ 
That inside we're broken , I tried to patch things up again \ 
To cut my tears and kill my fears but have I told you how I .. \ 
I'm not going \ 
Cause I've been waiting for a miracle and I'm not leaving\ 
I won't let you let you give up on a miracle\ 
Cause it might save you\ 
-Miracle , Paramore ( AKA the BEST band EVER ) 
? First my sister trys licking me , and now shes petting my head ... Umm I'm a little scared ... 
is really bored ... anyone wanna chat ? Lol 
According to < PROPFEMALE > , the new word for purple is \Gloop \"..." 
Me : < PROPFEMALE > , I seem to put a lot of posts about you\ 
< PROPFEMALE > : It's probably because you look up to me and you don't know it\ 
Me : I don't look up to you ! \ 
< PROPFEMALE > : Your right , you're too tall to look up to me ! 
Haha had fun earlier playing with < PROPFEMALE>'s new Ukulele XD I want one for my birthday now ! 
Crushcrushcrush by Paramore XD one of da awesomest songs < PROPFEMALE > 
So we finally find a planet that could support life but it will take generations to get there . 1 Question :\ 
HOW THE HECK DO THEY THINK WE ARE GONNA GET THERE ?!?!?! 
is running out of things to draw . I need something to inspire me ! XD 
“When we think we know people inside and out , and we think we know\ 
what’s best for them , we should try to remember we don’t even know\ 
what’s best for ourselves . ” \ 
— < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > 
hates the lingering feeling after you're done painting your nails , that they aren't dry when they actually are . Uggh < PROPFEMALE > annoying :p 
Stupid headaches :p 
? I still try holding onto silly things , I never learn . \ 
Oh why , all the possibilities I'm sure you've heard . ? \ 
? That's what you get when you let your heart win . \ 
I drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating \ 
And that's what you get when you let your heart win . ? \ 
-That's what you get , Paramore ? 
Who else is bored as heck ? 
The world today doesn't make sense , so why should I paint pictures that do ? \ 
~ Pablo Picasso 
I lug a freakin ' bass clarinet home just to find out that whoever used it beore me lost the freakin ' ligature ! Sooo not cool . :P 
Finally got done with all my freakin ' homework :P 
I'm losing my mind , broken inside\ 
I want you to take my breath away\ 
It's obvious that my heart beats for you\ 
-So Obvious , Runner Runner 
Your lovesick < PROPFEMALE > is gonna get the best of me tonight , but you won't get to me if I don't sing . It creeps in like a spider that can't be killed , although I try and try to . Well don't you see I'm falling ? Don't wanna love you but I do . \ 
Stop this song ( Lovesick < PROPFEMALE > ) >> Paramore << 
I got a lot to say to you , yeah , I got a lot to say\ 
I noticed your eyes are always glued to me\ 
Keeping them here , and it makes no sense at all . \ 
Rock and roll , baby\ 
Don't you know that we're all alone now ? \ 
I need something to sing about\ 
Nothing compares to a quiet evening alone , just the one-two of us , who's counting on\ 
That never happens , I guess I'm dreaming again\ 
Let's be more than this now 
Sagittarius are far from lazy but this motivation to move on is due to\ 
their hatred of boredom . Boredom is their fear and instead of facing\ 
it , they will up and leave in search of something more stimulating . \ 
Am I allowed to say I'm bored all the time now ? 
My freakin ' sister just karate chopped me in da face ! :P 
Just talk yourself up , and tear yourself down\ 
You've hit your one wall , now find a way around\ 
Well what's the problem ? You've got a lot of nerve\ 
I never wanted to say this , you never wanted to stay\ 
I put my faith in you , so much faith , and then you just threw it away\ 
-For a Pessimist , I'm pretty Optimistic >> Paramore << 
I hate math homwork :( 
Painting a picture of a scottish terrier wearing a scottish outfit . Never get tired of painting silly dogs ! <3 
is so freakin ' bored . Anyone wanna chat ?!?!? 
is in a very good mood ... It's sorta scaring me ... :D 
Haha for some reason I just heard a really high pitched noise Lol < PROPFEMALE > didn't hear it though , so maybe it's just my thoughts screaming at me . If it is they better shut up ! 
has nobody to text :( 
Listening to Paramore . Still waiting to get the 1st album . Grrr 
Well , I can see behind the curtain , the wheels are cranking , turning\ 
It's all wrong , the way we're working , towards a goal that's non-existent\ 
It's not existent , but we just keep believing\ 
I wanna know what it'd be like , to find perfection in my pride\ 
To see nothing in the light , I'll turn it off , in all my spite\ 
In all my spite , I'll turn it off\ 
-Turn it Off >> Paramore << 
is going to have another brother ... Now I won't be able to dress him in cute little outifts ! Girls are way more fun ! :) 
Where are these stupid headaches coming from ?!?!?! 
wants to go see Paranormal activity 2 ! :3 
? You're like an Indian summer in the middle of winter\ 
Like a hard < PROPFEMALE > with a surprise center\ 
How do I get better once I've had the best\ 
You said there's tons of fish in the water\ 
So the waters I will test ? \ 
-Thinking of you , >> Katy Perry << 
Bria : OMG < PROPFEMALE > !!!! < PROPFEMALE > KILLED < PROPFIRST > THE FLY !!!! \ 
Me : OMG < PROPFEMALE > !?!?!? YOU KILLED < PROPFIRST > !?!?!? \ 
Megan : Well , he was bothering me ..... \ 
Me : Well you bother me sometimes and I don't kill you ! \ 
lol my response didn't come out very uh ... nice .... XD 
Lol Brylie gave me some Hello < PROPFEMALE > stickers !!! She makes me feel so special ! lol XD 
My birthday is in exactly a month ! XD 
Haha ! My brother PROMISED he wouldn't bother me for the rest of the year ... Let's see how this works out ! :p 
We've learned to run from anything uncomfortable and we've tied our pain below but no one ever has to know that inside we're broken . I try to patch things up again , to calm my tears and kill these but have I told you , have I ? \ 
I'm not going cause I've been waiting for a miracle and I'm not leaving . I won't let you give up on a miracle when it might save you . \ 
-Miracle , Paramore

Open your eyes , Like I opened mine . It's only the real world ; A life you will never know . \ 
- Careful , Paramore 
Every night someone thinks of you before they go to bed . At least 15\ 
people love you . There are at least 2 people who would die for you . You\ 
mean the world to someone . Someone you didn’t even know exists loves\ 
you . When you make the biggest mistake ever , something good will come\ 
from it . <3

Grrrr . I hate chores . There's too much crap to get done today . :p 
is so super bored that it isn't even funny ! Anyone wanna chat ?!?!?!? 
Saw HP last night w/ < PROPFEMALE > . It was Epic ! XD 
Grrrr . Facebook is so dead right now O_o 
There's an empty room at the end of the hall , and its begging to swallow you whole . Each step you take makes it easier to fall on your face . Each tear you fake makes it easier to see straight through you now . \ 
-Throwing Punches , >> Paramore << 
And when we get home I know we won't be home at all , this place we live it is not where we belong . And I miss who we were and the town that we could call our own . Going back to get away after everything has changed . \ 
Could you remind me of a time when we were so alive ? \ 
- < PROPMALE > >> Paramore << 
Isn't it wonderful when all your friends get offline at the same time ? XP 
We R Who We R ! 
A normal person has 1,000 wishes . A Soldier only has one , to come home safe . I know 97% of you won't post this as your status , but the 3% that do are my friends . In honor of someone that died , a wounded warrior , or who is fighting for your freedom , please post . 
I seriously dont wanna go to the choir concert tomorrow :p 
Haha the :) 8th graders made us look TERRIBLE XD 
Pretty , pretty , please , don't you ever , ever feel like you're nothin ' you are perfect to me <3 \ 
>> Pink << Effin ' Perfect 
I'm strong on the surface , not all the way through . I've never been perfect but neither have you . \ 
-Leave out all the rest- >> Linkin Park << 
I tried to be someone else , but nothing seemed to change\ 
I know now , this is who I really am inside . \ 
Finally found myself\ 
-The Kill- >> 30 Seconds to Mars << 
30 seconds to Mars , Closer to the Edge video = AAAAAMAZINNG :) 
wishes she had someone to talk to ... 
Just got the Thirty Seconds to Mars cd THIS IS WAR yesterday :) BEST cd ever ! ( btw its $22 at Target ) 
I don't remember one moment , I tried to forget . I lost myself , is it better not said ? \ 
Now I'm closer to the edge\ 
It was a thousand to one and a million to two . Time to go down in flames and I'm taking you , \ 
Closer to the edge\ 
-Closer to the Edge- > Thirty Seconds to Mars < 
Muse just rocked the Grammy's :) FAAAAR better than any Lady Gaga could do ! 
I'm not satisfied with where I'm at in life . \ 
Am I supposed to be happy ? \ 
With all I ever wanted , it comes with a price . \ 
You said , you said that you would die for me ... \ 
-Cat and Mouse >> Red Jumpsuit Apparatus << 
Well I can see behind the curtain , The wheels are cranking , turning . It's all wrong the way we're working towards a goal that's nonexistent . Its nonexistent but we just keep believing . \ 
-Turn it off >> Paramore << 
Paranormal Activity 2 with < PROPFEMALE > and Mom :) 
Dinner for Schmucks = A waste of 2 hours of my life 
Saw a green shooting < PROPFEMALE > on my way home tonight while we were listening to the song Airplanes :) it happened right when the radio said shooting < PROPFEMALE > s XD 
Yeah and I would recommend that you live with no regrets\ 
And even if it seems like the world is crashing on you\ 
You shouldn't let it hold you down , shouldn't hold you back oh no\ 
Don't worry you'll show them ? \ 
-Seventeen aint so Sweet- >> The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus << 
And there was a time that I thought that I knew it all\ 
And there was a place that I thought I could call my own\ 
But it all came crashing down and I looked around\ 
And I knew that things would never be the same\ 
-Low Road >> Grace Potter and the Nocturnals << 
Is squirrel one syllable or two ? ... 
? Jump and Touch the Sky ? 
Truth , like < PROPMALE > , is in the eye of the beholder .
