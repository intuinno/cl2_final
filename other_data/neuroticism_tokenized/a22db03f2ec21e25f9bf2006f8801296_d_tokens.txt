financial situations just got worse . u.u 
fuckin ' grills , how do THEY work ? 
So , I sent my mother an e-mail telling her I'd like her to be a part of my life , hoping that she'll stop hating me . 
whenever I start up my laptop , it tells me \ewoqefameteqa . dll\ " cannot be found . Does anyone know what this is ? I can't find it on google . " 
The sky is blue and all the leaves are green . My heart's as full as a baked potato ~ 
Iron Man 2 kinda sucked . Plot was all over the place . >.> 
my mom told my sisters that I'm trans today , after some hard convincing from my brother . They are very okay with it . :DDDDDD 
there's so much time , and so little to do with it . :( 
so , my mother has apparently been trying to indoctrinate my baby sister against me . She doesn't want to use the right name because \mom says it's bad to use that name \"" 
feels like she'll never be happy with herself . :( 
I think I pissed my brother off last night over a board game , by choosing emotion over logic , then cried about pissing him off . I'm not sure whether this is validating or pathetic . :/ 
really , really doesn't want to go to work today . Like , you have no idea . 
thought of the day : What if < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST>'s Hot & Cold is about a bipolar person ? O.o 
you can \like\ " comments on statuses now ? The hell ? " 
Our toilet just started making sounds like a techno song . What in the world is happening ? o.o 
So , I had gotten a letter about a missed toll violation , in the amount of $62.40 . After calling and talking to a representative , they were able to remove the violation costs , so I only had to pay $1.60 for the actual tolls . :D 
I don't get lucky often , and when I do , I save it up , and buy something pretty . And it looks like I used up all my luck . <3 you , < PROPFEMALE > . 
Is it just me , or have the whole facebook profile picture week/month events kind of dropped off as of late ? 
just finished No More Heroes . Guess I better keep on running forever . 
gotta go take care of graduation stuff today ( hopefully ) so I can get into NIU . :O 
Just finished Metroid Prime 3 . Play time : 17:24 , Completion : 83% Now to go back and 100% it . <3 
going to the Quad Cities for < PROPFEMALE>'s birthday . Be back Saturday ~ 
Got back from the Quad Cities alright , then immediately had to go to work . So tired . @.@ 
So , our power got turned off today due to nonpayment . We were able to pay the < PROPMALE > , but now can't pay the money for rent that was due on the first of this month . If anyone would like to help , my paypal account is pirikokalendi@gmail.com Thank you . 
need to get my transcript in , then I should be good for attending NIU . Now I just have to find out how to pay the $115 orientation fee . >.< 
is being kept down by the man . 
is officially a < PROPMALE > at NIU . :DDDDDD

is really , REALLY going to miss < PROPFEMALE > . Good luck in Washington , you . ;.; 
is getting back to work on her animal ethics paper . >.>; 
1 month until my 21st birthday ! :D 
Sitting in the bathroom , shower running for warmth , eating poptarts , putting the final touches on this paper that's been TERRORIZING ME FOR 2 WEEKS NOW . 
feels that her mind is starting to go . Just in general , as compared to a few years ago . 
So , my 21st birthday is in a little over 2 weeks . I have NO idea what I'm doing , if anything . Help ? 
Hey , how many people want to come out to celebrate my 21st ? Probably going to be at a bar , probably with music . 
Who has two thumbs and doesn't want to go to work ? This girl ! 
had a really shitty day at work . 8 hours and 138 corsage/boutonniere orders . Oh , and I broke down crying . u.u 
I knew the free time wouldn't last forever . Back to school it is ! 
just got a voicemail from < PROPFEMALE > Peachtree in the middle of class . She didn't tell me where she was , but at least we now know she's alive . :D 
I don't think I'm doing anything for my 21st birthday . It's coming too fast to plan anything big . :/ 
isn't going to be able to celebrate her birthday properly because she has to work that evening , then the next morning . >.> 
is transgender and pansexual and National Coming Out Day is tomorrow .

So , I assumed that all I had to do for my Animal Rights class this week was read some stuff . BOY WAS I WRONG . Turns out that we need to finish the book we were on , read 5 (!!!) other articles , and crank out an outline and rough draft for a review of the book . FML 
I don't remember seeing the word apartheid before today , but now I've seen it in like , five different places in the last 3 hours . What the hell , world ? 
I actually chose to get a completely vegetarian dinner when meat options were very obviously given . A black bean hummus pita now partially resides in my stomach . I'm kind of proud of myself , but DAMN was it hard to not get steak . 
It's 9 AM and I've already received 13 birthday wishes . You guys work fast ! :D 
just got back from her first time at a bar . I didn't ever get carded , got hit on by the bartender , and got hit on by a random drunk guy talking about how he makes up imaginary words . Plus , I got to see < PROPFIRST > Torraco ! It was a good night . :D 
likes it when she wakes up with awesome bedhead . :D 
1st paper : completed and turned in . I don't feel great about it , but at least it's done . Tore a famous philosopher a new one in writing it . Now on to my second paper , due tomorrow . .___. 
DONE ! How the hell did I write 2200 words so quickly ?! o.o 
Rest in peace , < PROPFEMALE > . Rest in peace . 
Gotta go into work early today . Ahh , FML . 
When I got home , I was greeted with candlelight , music , < PROPMALE > , and the lovely girlfriend who had put it all together . Thank you , < PROPFEMALE > Hill , for making a perfect evening . <3

THERE , HAPPY ?! 
is depressed for some reason . Not sure why , just feeling down . 
why am I such a bitch sometimes ? 
eatin ' pancakes with syrup . <3 
okay , wind , I usually love you , but you've been a huge jerk lately . 
didn't get enough sleep last night . Here's to hoping I don't fall asleep in class . >.< 
So , it turns out the party that I was planning to go to tomorrow was actually tonight . Now I don't have any halloween plans . :( 
Is it just me , or does Resurrection from Gitaroo Man totally sound like Use the Man by Megadeth ? 
Awake at 6:30 in the morning ? It's more likely than you think . 
Why is my computer not allowing me to use any other browser than Firefox ? I just downloaded Chrome to try it out , and it won't let me connect to any websites . >.> 
Remember , remember ... 
Guys , I'm gonna have to delete my facebook . 
God , I feel like such a fucking failure . 
You're out of my mind , out of my mind . 
Do you guys realize that , in just over 2 years , we won't be able to make/join facebook groups for days with repeating < PROPFIRST > ? WHAT A SHAME . 
Why did I not even find out that it was Veteran's Day until right now ? o.o 
What am I doing up this late ? I have work in the morning ! And yet , I'm not even tired . What the hell , brain ? 
Why must I feel bad about sharing negative feelings on facebook ? 
The balloon from my 21st birthday is STILL floating , more than a month later . 
Why do humans need sleep ? I wish it was a necessity we could turn off , especially when we need that time for things like school projects . 
Eff you minecraft , for being so tempting and trying to keep me away from this paper . I NEED TO FINISH THIS , STAY OUT OF MY HEAD . 
had a great day at work today . :D 
is eatin ' roasted garlic triscuits with chives & onion cream cheese . Sooooo tasty . <3 
Why do I always get depressed when I'm supposed to be writing a paper ? 
coined a new phrase : philosobabble . It's like technobabble , but for philosophy . 
So tired , still need to finish a paper . Just two more weeks , Katja . Just two more ... 
Is it weird that when I look at something , like a book , and see that it was created ( published ) the same year I was born , that I look at it with a certain sort of respect for having survived so long ? 
Getting an early start on the \post a pokemon as your profile pic\ " month . Hitomoshi ! <3 " 
had a rough time in class today . I started crying a bit from one of the videos we watched . 
Hipster exclamation of the day : \Did they just use ' meatspace ' unironically ? GUH ! \"" 
Turns out I need to go into work for extra hours today . And I was looking forward to my first actual day off in like , 3 weeks . * shakes a fist at her classes * 
feels really illegitimate . D: 
is up all night yet again , working on papers . 
Just make it through today , just make it through today . Oh , and study so you can get an A on your ethics final . 
My thumb is still numb from my ethics final . So much writing ! @.@ 
just saw her grades . All A's on my first semester at NIU , yo . :DDD 
So , the weather sucks too much to make it to the Quad Cities for Christmas , and on top of that , I get home just to find that my laptop's power supply has died . < PROPFEMALE > Christmas to me . D: 
It doesn't feel any different to me today . It just feels like another cold , wintry day . I think the Christmas spirit has left me . :( 
is going to a new years ' party with a bunch of people she doesn't know . Trying new things is exciting ! 
H ????????????????????????????? E ???????????????????????????????? ??????????????????? C ??????????????????????????? O ????????????????????????????????? M ?????????????????????? E ?????????????? S ??????????????????????? 
Could you would you , on a train ? I could , I would browse facebook on a train . 
came home from vacation to find a shiny new laptop power adapter . <3 
Gotta get up early for school tomorrow . :O 
had an interesting dream last night that concluded in me deciding that a good addition to the \finger moustache\ " thing would be a thumb goatee . " 
So , turns out there's a HIGH of 3 degrees today . Illinois , how I loathe you . 
is going to get her driver's license renewed today . Now , with the correct marker . :DDD 
Just got some new clothes . Possible pictures later . :3 
Hooray , I don't have classes after 3pm today . 
Dear Bookface : I am sick of you not telling me I have notifications when I clearly should . Please get your ass in gear . Love , Katja . <3 
I think my body's reaction to cold is somewhat solipsistic . When it's cold out , but I see no reason for it to be cold , I'm FREEZING . Last night , when there's clearly a lot of reason to be cold ( i.e. SNOOOOW ) , I wasn't cold at all . 
So , classes are canceled tomorrow , too . No school this week , apparently . 
has been marathon-ing < PROPFEMALE > Trek TNG . I feel like such a nerd .
