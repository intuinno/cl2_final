Looking for a family who wants a sweet , loveable pet cat named Mr. < PROPMALE > Jangles . He is about 6 , loves to cuddle and be petted . 
Our new cat broke my favorite set of candlesticks this morning . Boy cats are just as curious , but waaaaayyy more clumsy . He's lucky he's so darn cute and apologetic , or he'd be in BIG trouble . 
Congratulations to < PROPMALE > Moeller for being an absolute ROCK < PROPFEMALE > !!! I could not be more proud of you and your accomplishments ! Hawii , here we come ! \ 
Anyone have any suggestions for things to do and see in Hawii ?? We've never been . :)
