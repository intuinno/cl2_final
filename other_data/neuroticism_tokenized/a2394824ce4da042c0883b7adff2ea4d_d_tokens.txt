National Cookie day ! Om nom nom nom . 

I just found out that the girl who can't stop sneezing was diagnosed with P.A.N.D.A.S. ( Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder Associated with Streptococcus ) I hope I'm not the only one to say this , But I laughed uncontrollably . I'm glad doctors have a sense of humor and an internet connection to watch \Sneezing Panda\ " on youtube " 
If it's cold enough to see your breathe outside ; If you play your instrument , Will you see you breath go out the instrument ? Never tested it and now I'm curious and want to try it . 
Happy National Cupcake day ! Nom nom nom . 
Apparently I have a thing for guys who have been strangled .

Get my braces off on December 9th ! So happy about it !!! 
I get my braces off next Thursday , and honor band auditions are next Saturday . I'm stuck between keeping them on another 2 weeks maybe or just do my best to adjust friday . Not sure what to do ! 
When you wish upon a falling < PROPFEMALE > , Your dreams can come true . \ 
Unless it's really a meteorite hurtling to the earth which will\ 
destroy all life . Then you're pretty much hosed no matter what you\ 
wish for . Unless it's death by meteor . 
Practiced pretty much for four hours yesterday to adjust without braces and get better at the music and barely passed for Mr. Truitt .... Now I've been practicing since 5 and going to practice the rest of the night ! \ 
Having ice cream to help my mouth after playing so long and then going to go back at it . \ 
This is really too much work ...

Apparently on my brother's last day in California , he managed to make $20 by singing happy birthday as < PROPFIRST > Duck to a kid in Disneyland . \ 
I love my brother . 
I may really hate AP with a passion , but now I feel like I'm properly prepared if I ever go on a game show . 
I just bolted after my dog who tried to run away at 9:15 at night while wearing Hello < PROPFEMALE > pajamas and slippers . Looks like I'm well enough to go to school tomorrow . 
FIRST PLACE BY 8 POINTS !!!! Good job everybody ! It's going to be a GREAT season ! 
Absolutely loved today ! Spent my 11 months hiking with < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , and < PROPFIRST > and later going to his house to watch 2012 with him and < PROPFIRST>'s mom . Cried like a girl a lot but was a great movie ! I want to < PROPFEMALE > out with them a lot more ! I really want to get back into Team Fortress 2 again too ... Haven't played it in forever ! 
I just got helpful straight lessons from Geffery . 
Note to self : check < PROPMALE>'s messages on his Facebook ! 
What chapter did we have to outline for Mr. Jeross's class ? Completely forgot about it until now and I don't know which chapter he wants .
