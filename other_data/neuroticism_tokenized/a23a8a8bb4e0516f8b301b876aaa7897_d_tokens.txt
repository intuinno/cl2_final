My only practice with speaking pompous-sounding Vietnamese is in the hospital , giving directions to non-English speaking visitors . I need to fine a new , more useful , language . 

I just barely passed my WST ; I'm happy about it . 
I'm Sofa < PROPMALE > sore from working out today with < PROPFIRST > . Gym membership fees is going to cut into my monthly alcohol fund . 
My brain told me that I don't study enough for my finals . \ 
\ 
This morning , I dreamed that I was in the library being lectured that , \[I ] need to study harder 
Finals = Over ! 
I'm bored 
Only cool kids do 16hours of chem/1day . 
=( 
Week 1 : Down , 7 to go .
