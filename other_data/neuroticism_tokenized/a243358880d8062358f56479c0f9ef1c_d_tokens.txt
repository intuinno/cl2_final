Yea ! I got my tooth pulled ..... when the novicaine wears off ( next week - LOL ! ) I'm sure it'll feel a lot better . Turns out it was absessed too ( which is why it broke in the first place) ! Both the Dr. & nurse were baffled & surprised it didn't hurt . They said it was more than 90% gone & only took about 5 mins . to get it out(after x-ray & novicaine took effect ) . Amazing !

While you SCREAM at your woman , there's a man wishing he could talk softly to her ear ...

While you ...... make ... your woman CRY the ...... there's a man stealing smiles from her ... Post this if you're against Domestic Violence ?

A true friend doesn't care when you're broke , being a bitch , what you weigh , if your house is a mess , what you drive , about your past , or if your family is filled with CRAZY people . Your conversations pick up where they left off , even if they have been months apart . They love you for who you are . Re-post if you have at least one true friend . 
Cousins are the 1st friends of your life . Cousins are there as childhood friends . No one will ever understand your crazy family like your cousins . Even if you don't talk much lately , re-post this if you have some of the best cousins in the world !
