Patriots dominated da turkeys , I mean Bears . No denying the best team in the NFL . Bring on Green Bay ! Bears D- over rated ! Pats in snow games , awesome ! Nuf ced haters !!!!!!!!!!!! 
Love or hate , I don't care either way ; I am what makes me , well me . On another positive note , the Patriots dropped the pitiful Bears D; nice that our opponents talk trash ; did we forget to tell you all , talk trash , it makes us step our game up . Ask the Colts , ask the Rats , ask Chicago . 31-28 , 45-3 , 36-7 respectively for wins . Put up 45 vs Lions . You ppl who doubt the Pats , are you real ? . 
This Christmas , while you are eating your dinners and celebrating with your famiy , remember that in another house there is an empty chair where a hero should be sitting . So light a candle this Christmas for our fallen heroes that did not make it back—and for those still serving in Iraq , Afghanistan , or elsewhere . Join me in saluting all our heroes by posting this as your status . 
God saw you getting tired and a cure was not to be . So he put his arms around you and whispered come with me . With tearful eyes we watched and saw you pass away . Although we love you dearly we could not make you stay . A < PROPFEMALE > heart stopped beating , hard working hands at rest . God broke our hearts to prove to us He only takes the best . Put as status if there is someone in Heaven you will miss this Christmas ?

The Girl you just called fat ? She has been starving herself & has lost over 30lbs . The Boy you just called stupid ? He has a learning disability & studies over 4hrs a night .
