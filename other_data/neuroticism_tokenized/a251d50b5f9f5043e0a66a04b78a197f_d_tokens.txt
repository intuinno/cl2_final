watching < PROPMALE > Horror Picture Show ... baseball game is just too depressing 
you might've heard i run with a dangerous crowd .. we ain't too pretty , we ain't too proud ... 
no need for toys r us anymore !!! my internet cooperated long enough for me to find exactly what < PROPMALE > wanted on amazon for $13 less than toys r us including shipping !! yay !! I hate shooping !! 
Yup I have definately moved to Mars ! We planted our Christmas tree this morning ... OUTSIDE ... IN THE GROUND ... IN JANUARY !! the ground isn't even beginning to freeze yet . I oduen baffled at how much different it is here without being much further south !! 
Bowling awards for the kids ! Camryn's team came in 1st place and she made the pepsi tournament so she got a trophy and a medal . < PROPMALE > came in 3rd place for the bumper kids and got high handicap boys for bumpers ... 2 trophies . Reilly was the only girl in bumpers so she swept every catagory and came home with 4 trophies ... Now where do I put them all ? 
Never EVER EVER trust a tomtom and a 10 year old at the same time ! Fastest route my ass ! at least it got me home ! I NEVER WANT TO DRIVE IN NYC AGAIN !!!! 
Getting excited about going away with my mommy this weekend ! 
No kids and no < PROPFIRST > this weekend so maybe I can start sorting through crap and figure out what we're moving and what I am making go away !... maybe ... 
So I had a store call in because they had a customer return a Diva cup ... which is nasty enough but the story was worsf ! they went to the dr. to get it out & returned it with a dr. note ! if you don't know what a diva cup is google it you'll see the ick !! 
Nothing from < PROPMALE>'s lawyer yet .. wonder if that means he came to his senses or is just waiting til the last minute ? 
Well < PROPMALE > got ahold of a mediator ... I wonder if it means he's ready to talk or if its the first step toward court and he wants to put on a show ... 
Is today over yet ? Heading to < PROPFEMALE > tonight with the first load of stuff ... and NO KIDS !!! 
SLEEPY !!!! 
< PROPFIRST > called this am with an interesting statistic .. Did you know 6 out or 7 dwarves are not happy ? - ok that proves it my boyfriend is a geek !

Got out of ER a little bit ago ... nasty strep ... so sore ... so tired 
Wholly weirdness ! I'm laying here on the couch flipping channels and came across some guy playing Feel like making love on the bagpipes ... WTF ?!? 
Cam is turning 11 tomorrow ! I'm having guilty mommy issues leaving the kiddos with their father this wknd as much of an ass as he's being to them about moving ...

The only thing worse than a monday is a tuesday pretending to be a monday ! Of course it's my own fault for being a stubborn mule who couldn't force myself to do something I didn't want to do ... like head back up here at a decent time ! got home @ 3 am 
Feeling even more intolerant of stupid people than usual ... and we all know what a sweet tolerant girl I generally am ! 
Everytime I think about everything i have to do in the neyt 4 wks I get totally overwhelmed ! I guess I need to make a point of not looking at the whole picture and break packing into little steps 
Went to see Cam in the cow parade ... now hanging with < PROPFEMALE > and going to her girls dance recital later 
Working on packing ... trying not to get overwhelmed ... baby steps ! 
29 days til I move and I'm not freaking out or panicking in any way nope not me ... think if I keep telling myself that it'll be true ? ugghh ! 
28 days left ... feeling less panicky today ! 15 days til I take Camryn to her 1st concert ... REO Speedwagon and < PROPFIRST > Benetar ... she's wicked excited REO has always been her fav .

Ever notice that after Monday and Tuesday the calendar says W T F ? 
Helluva thunderstorm just passed through now me and 3 kids are sitting here in the dark ... good thing I have a minor obsession with candles ! 
Everyday is summer and I can't hide my smile . The world is on my side now and it has been for a while . Butterflies inside me and I can touch the sky . You're the reason why I wrote this lullaby ~ < PROPFEMALE > Critchley

The kids have an early release Friday but < PROPMALE > says \we have an early missle friday ! \ " when I corrected him he absolutely insisted I was the one wrong !! " 
I'm completely baffled by this Westboro Baptist Church thing . Do those people really believe God is endorsing their hate filled practices ? Picketing a funeral is sick especially when it is a fallen solider . DISGUSTING !!! 
Miss my kiddo's while their at their fathers but < PROPFIRST > is taking the whole weekend off and alone time is GOOD !!!

HA ! YAY ! GO RANGERS ! bye bye Yankees ! 
Off witH < PROPFIRST > and the twin-a-saurases to see Cam's play ... even though she's not actually in it ... she's running spotlight . 
Mr. Bubble in the hot tub was the BEST IDEA EVER ! We had bubbles over our heads ! I have the awsomest boyfriend ! 
Why is it when certain movies are on tv we have to watch them even if we own them ? YAY FOR < PROPMALE > HORROR PICTURE SHOW !

Staying home is killing me so I registered at a temp agency today ... I had to laugh when I saw they had a listing for a MD ... Really ? if dr's have to go to tenp agencies we must be in trouble ! 
In Hershey to see the \Sweet Lights\ " ... holy traffic batman ! " 
So \Sweet Lights\ " in Hershey last night really weren't any better than \ " Bright Lights\ " in Springfield < PROPFEMALE > . just more hyped cuz they're Hershey . " 
Went to see < PROPMALE > Potter yesterday ( finally ! ) ! It's AWESOME ! They stayed pretty true to the book ... at least more so than the rest of them 
Just had to restuff Eerie and Moo ... after the bear fron the Island of Misfit Toys had both girls in tears !! 
The guy on the radio just said something about a pu pu platter and the twins absolutely cracked up ! funny how I forgot how funny that is ... I LOVE MY KIDS ! 
I don't get why I can't find boneless chicken with the skin still on ... 
Pretty pretty snow outside ! just aw dusting but it makes my yard pretty ! 
Went and got our tree yesterday ! we got one with its roots so we can plant it in the spring . The funny thing is the tree I picked I like from a distance and its a Norwegian Spruce- a prickly Norwegian thing just like < PROPFIRST > !! 
Somehow I didn't notice < PROPMALE > climbed in bed with me last night at somepoint . When I asked him how that happened he says \I don't know maybe I'm a ninja ! \ " Silly boy ! " 
Off to Camryn's band and chorus concert with < PROPFIRST>'s parents and the twins . 
Thinks it's hilarious that NY is taking < PROPFIRST > signing with the Phillies personally ! It's not a problem with the city it's the pompous arrogance of the team !!! 
Seriously considering murderizing my 11 year old ! The little shit lost her new phone at school yesterday and didn't bother telling me until tonight ! GRRRRRRR !!!!!! 
Ok so I don't have to kill her ... she found her phond ... in her damn backpack ... after I asked if she bothered to clean it out to be sure it wasn't there ! maybe this was enough of a scare to whip her into shape ! 
While I was making supper Reilly out of nowhere comes out and sits in the middle of the floor with her feet together pulled in close and starts ohmmm-ing ! I laughed so hard I couldn't even ask where that came from !! 
Tree is up and beautiful ... kids are out playing in the woods ... < PROPFIRST>'s watcking football and I'm baking a cake ! Yup seems pretty perfect to me !!! 
Twins are off to see < PROPFEMALE > with < PROPFIRST>'s parents when CAm was asked if she wanted to go she said \oh hell no ! \ " I couldn't reprimand her I was laughing too hard ! she's afraid of < PROPFEMALE >!" 
WTF ?! I swear I live in the burmuda triangle of weather ! Snow all around us but NONE here ! All summer was the same thing with rain we could stand outside and watch storms all around us and we had a drought !! 
YAY ! I get my babies back tomorrow ! We can have christmas Saturday and I can un-christmas this house Sunday !! 
If a deer only has 1 antler does that qualify as a unicoqn ? If yes ... I SAW A UNICORN LOL !!! 
Stuffy head ... fever ... sore throat ... achy all over ... how the hell do I catch a cold whem I never go anywhere ? It's just not fair !!!! 
Well Camryn and < PROPFIRST>'s dad have gone skiing ... < PROPFIRST > got them both season passes for night skiing at Roundtop ... hopefully no one breaks anything !! 
< PROPFIRST>'s at work ... Cam's at < PROPFEMALE>'s ... < PROPMALE>'s next door ... Just me and Reilly cuddling on the couch !! 
I'd rather laugh with the Seahawks than cry with the Saints ! OMG did that just happen GO SEAHAWKS !!!! 
Garlicy pork chops ... mashed potatoes ... garlic and cheese biscuits and apple sauce ... SUPER YUM !!! 
Thanks everyone for the birthday wishes ... and since < PROPFIRST>'s working and the kids are in school I'm off spoiling myself a bit .. hair cut and Thai food ! 
So I let Cam go skiing alone last night with the stipulation that she had to take her lesson ... which being a good kid she did . She lucked out and ended up with a private lesson ! The instructor took her on a half pipe thing ... OMG MOM IT WAS FUN ! EEKK !! 
OMG !!!!! It is so friggin loud in this house !!! Cam's besty has been here since Friday and everybody is so wound up I want to hide !!!... so I am ... in my room watching the Tudors marathon on BBCA !!!!! 
There was a full on Nerf war going on while I was making breakfast this am ... I turned to my little terrorists and said Bacon for Peace ? they both gave up their guns for bacon !! Too bad that won't work on a global scale !!!! 
I've been at the library with the kids for more than 2 hours and they're showing no signs of wanting to go home !!!! 
Watched < PROPMALE > with the twins this am and I've been obsessing about lasagna since ... guess thats what I'm making forw dinner !! 
YAY Cam made honor roll again ! 2 semesters in a row ! BUT ... is it weird that I'm really struggling not to be cranky about 3 B's ? 
Got a new phone with a < PROPFEMALE > . # if I didn't text it to you and you want it send me a message 
I WANT SNOW !!! 
There is , something wrong with my kids ... They have a snow day and I have to force them to go outside ... It's just wrong !! 
I cannot believe it's been 25 years since the Challenger blew up . I was on 4th grade and wanted to be an astronaut until that moment . I still require stars but thankfully there is am observatory right up the road and I can remain on the ground .

Then we came home and < PROPFIRST>'s dad helped put up the swingset now that all the snow is once again gone ... I'm pooped ! 
There are little daffodils or crocuses or tulips or hyacinths or something popping up in my yard and it's only the 1st of March !!!! 
I figured out why I'm fat ! The shampoo I use in the shower that runs down my body says \For extra volume and body\ " . I'm going to start using \ " Dawn\ " dish soap . It says \ " Dissolves fat that is otherwise difficult to remove\ " . Repost if you have the same issue ! " 
Hey ! Village Idiots picketing fallen Soldiers funerals ...... Yeah , I'm talking to you ! Do you know WHY you are allowed to do that ? BECAUSE THE DEAD SOLDIER YOU ARE TRASHING , GAVE HIS LIFE SO YOU WOULD HAVE THE FREEDOM TO EXPRESS YOUR STUPIDITY !!!!!!! \

RIP < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > 
Last day before I start my new job and what am I doing ? NOTHING !!! well almost nothing just watching < PROPFEMALE > Brown and nursing a bad case of wanderlust !!! 
Now I'm not normally one to judge people but I seem to have a problem with a friend of Camryn's and her parents ... the girl keeps getting texts from her \boyfriend\ " telling her she's sexy ... she's in 6th grade !!! and I get the impression her parents don't care ... the mom blew me off introducing myself ... and they're just GROSS . when did I become a snob ? "
