Going to try 2 go to sleep early tonight . Busy day today and even more busy day scheduled tomorrow . It seems that as soon as my head hits the pillow ... I think of a million things that need to be done . I almost think I need to put a notebook and pen beside the bed . I think the only reason I don't is because I never would go to sleep from writing everything down ... haha 
Don't you just love it when ... you get great news all day long ( with the exception of the ( jkl this morning ) . I mean one thing right after other great great great . ;-) ican't wait to see what tomorro brings ..... 
dislikes speed bumps . Why is it when you’re going along in life and everything is running smoothly ... someone or something always tries to put a speed bump in your way ? I just hope I can get over this one or that I can at least go around it , without much damage ! Is this a test ? I mean really ! Customers ... gotta love em'! 
Still at the office ... I skipped lunch ... so now I am about to OD on candy-corn ! I need to get out of here before I make myself sick ! hahaha < PROPFIRST > ... Please just call my cell when you get finished looking over the proposal and I will pull it up on my cell phone . Thanks ! =)

Good morning Facebook Peeps .. Hope you have a Wonderful Day ! :) 
Today we mourn the passing of a beloved old friend , Common Sense , who has been with us for many years . No one knows for sure how old he was , since his birth records were long ago lost in bureaucratic red tape . He will be remembered as having cultivated such valuable lessons as : - Knowing when to come in out of the rain ; - Why the early bird gets the worm ; ... - Life isn't always fair ; - And maybe it was my fault . Common Sense lived by simple , sound financial policies , don't spend more than you can earn and adults , not children , are in charge . His health began to deteriorate rapidly when well-intentioned but overbearing regulations were set in place . Reports of a 6-year-old boy charged with sexual harassment for kissing a classmate ; teens suspended from school for using mouthwash after lunch ; and a teacher fired for reprimanding an unruly student , only worsened his condition . Common Sense lost ground when parents attacked teachers for doing the job that they themselves had failed to do in disciplining their unruly children . It declined even further when schools were required to get parental consent to administer sun lotion or an aspirin to a student ; but could not inform parents when a student became pregnant and wanted to have an abortion . Common Sense lost the will to live as the churches became businesses ; and criminals received better treatment than their victims . Common Sense took a beating when you couldn't defend yourself from a burglar in your own home and the burglar could < PROPFEMALE > you for assault . Common Sense finally gave up the will to live , after a woman failed to realize that a steaming cup of coffee was hot . She spilled a little in her lap , and was promptly awarded a huge settlement . Common Sense was preceded in death , by his parents , Truth and Trust , by his wife Discretion , his daughter Responsibility , and his son , Reason . He is survived by his 4 stepbrothers ; I Know My Rights , I Want It Now , Someone Else Is To Blame and I'm A Victim Not many attended his funeral because so few realized he was gone . 
So ready for this weekend to get here ! I have huge plans to do absolutely NOTHING ! :D 
Dear Mister iPhone , I know that you are a \Smart\ " phone ! However ; I would really appreciate it if you could please stop correcting my spelling if you are going to use a completely different word than I intended ! For starters you can take shot & he'll out of your vocabulary because I assure you .... those were Not the words I intended to use ! " 
Where's the DISLIKE button when you really need it ? Haha
