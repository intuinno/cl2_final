Complete with jingling bells and dancing . \

You know your dad's Russian/Kazakh when your worth is measured by how much dowry/livestock you will bring in marriage . \ 
Dad : Well yeah , we have to spend a lot of money on you . So we forgive your little clothing expenditures , because that just means more bulls and sheep for us . 
Dear Short People , \ 
Do look out , will you ? Next time we have school I am glomping you all . \

Dad : Why are you so SLOW ? Go up to 30 . \ 
Ksenia : But the speed limit's 25 and I'm a student driver and - \ 
Dad : Whatever . Do 30 , they only take a point off if you're 5 mph over the speed limit . \
