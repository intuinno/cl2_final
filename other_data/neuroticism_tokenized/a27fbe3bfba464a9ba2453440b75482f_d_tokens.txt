ya\ 
know what i just realized ... our game against < PROPMALE > union is going to \ 
be the game of the week and our team sucks and our show is TOTES crappy \ 
at this point !!!! 
people build up all this hype about high school and how much different it is , but in oakwood , everybody knows everyone , so even going to jr. high wasn't a big change . the only acception we have is that drama , gossip , and all the political bs spreads soooo much faster 
navagated through the back back of oakwood and got us a block away from where we were going , then got us back to the right street . dont give me crap 
Don't you love sitting in your house , or at your sister's soccer game and being able to jam out to some Blink 182 from X-fest ??

Ifyou believe in Jesus Christ , put this on your wall . Do not just ignore this . In the bible it says , if you deny me in front of your peers , I will deny you in front of my Father , at the gates of Heaven . This is a simple test . If you love god and are not afraid to show it , put this on your wall 
today = 1)waking up and saying\this looks like tornado weather\ " 2)having mr. waller tell everyone that we wee having a tornado DRILL to keep everyone calm(didn't work)3)people using my phone for the hour we were in the sophomore hall because i was the only one with service4)walking home cold because the wind was blowing the rain sideways and i was wearing shorts and took my shoes of to keep them dry "

RESOLUTIONS DUE ON MONDAY !!!!!!! 
\your gunna catch a cold from the ice inside your heart \"" 
Being vulnerable doesn't have to be threatening . Just have the courage to be sincere , open and honest . This opens a door to deeper communication all around . It creates self-empowerment and the kind of connections with others we all want in life . Speaking from the heart frees us from the secrets that burden us . These secrets make us sick and fearful . Speaking truth helps you get clarity on your real heart directives . 
FINALLY DONE WITH THE RESOLUTION !!!!!!!!!!!!!! CAN'T WAIT TO SEE ALL MY FRIENDS AGAIN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
my resolution got rejected !!!!!!!!!!

you are an idiot . if you raise the taxes on oil and gas companies , you are raising the fuel prices nation wide . if you cut tax returns , you are crashing the economy even more . and that i trillion dollars you are generating from the nation's much needed tax money is only a portion of the near 14 trillion dollars that the national debt is , most of which is YOUR overspending . 
\You spent half of your life trying to fall behind\ 
soccer was crazy . played down 6 girls ... lost 13 to 1 , played goalie ... pretty fun
