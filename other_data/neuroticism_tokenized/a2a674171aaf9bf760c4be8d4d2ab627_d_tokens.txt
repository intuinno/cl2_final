If a man dwells on the past , then he < PROPMALE > s the present . But if a man ignores the past , he may < PROPMALE > the future . The seeds of our < PROPFEMALE > are nurtured by the roots of our past . 
Certain things catch your eye , But pursue only those that capture your heart . old indian saying 
Humankind has not woven the web of life . We are but one thread within it . Whatever we do to the web , we do to ourselves . All things are bound together . All things connect . 
All things in the world are two . In our minds we are two , good and evil . With our eyes we see two things , things that are fair and things that are ugly .... We have the right hand that strikes and makes for evil , and we have the left hand full of kindness , near the heart . One foot may lead us to an evil way , the other foot may lead us to a good . So are all things two , all two . 
Where no one intrudes , many can live in < PROPFEMALE > 
Though a tree grows so high , the falling leaves return to the root . 
going to borders wit < PROPMALE > 
Criticizing is easy , < PROPMALE > is difficult . 
< PROPMALE > is everywhere , except it has to pass through a creative mind .

you are young and life is long and there is time to kill today 
Where the Wild Things Are theres one in all of us 
< PROPMALE > show tonight 
tv/bed then tomarrow im going to staved rock ! 
don't criticize What you can't understand 
Last night , I had a dream We were inseparably entwined Like a piece of rope made out of two pieces of vine Held together , holding each other With no one else in mind Like two atoms in a molecule Inseparably combined 
“Tension is who you think you should be . Relaxation is who you are . ” 
today was odd ... workout/bed then zoo tomarrow ! 
Do you need anybody ? I just need someone to love . Could it be anybody ? I want somebody to love 
What dose a space ranger actually do ? 
Don't underestimate the value of Doing Nothing , of just going along , listening to all the things you can't hear , and not bothering . 
“Life goes on within you and without you” 
Try to realize it's all within yourself N o-o ne else can make you change 
f I could start again a million < PROPMALE > away I would keep myself I would find a way 
everyone I know goes away in the end 
“When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse Out of the corner of my eye . I turned to look but it was gone I cannot put my finger on it now The child is grown , The dream is gone . I have become comfortably numb . ” 
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today . And then one day you find ten years have got behind you . No one told you when to run , you missed the starting gun 
A true friend is someone who lets you have total freedom to be yourself - and especially to feel . Or , not feel . Whatever you happen to be feeling at the moment is fine with them . That's what real love amounts to - letting a person be what he really is . 
Slow down ! You move too fast 
“If you wanna find out what's behind these cold eyes You'll just have to claw your way through this disguise” 
“Be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind . ” 
Got a good reason , for taking the easy way out\ 
Day tripper , yeah ! 
All you \ 
touch and all you see is all your life will ever be . 
Please don't spoil my day \ 
\ 
I'm < PROPMALE > away \ 
And after all \ 
I'm only sleeping 
And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking . \ 
Racing around to come up behind you again . \ 
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older . \ 
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death . 
“Be\ 
who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don't matter \ 
and those who matter don't mind . ” 
woo haircutt at 6 ! 
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways , \ 
My independence seems to vanish in the haze . \ 
But every now and then I feel so insecure , \ 
I know that I just need you like I've never done before . 
\Ur nice a good guy funny artsy\ " \ 
i had quite an amazing weekend ! 
Strangers passing in the street , by < PROPMALE > two separate glances meet and\ 
I am you and what I see is me 
watching lost ! Last episode 
And no one called us to the land \ 
And no one knows the where's or \ 
why's . \ 
Something stirs and something tries \ 
Starts to climb \ 
toward the light . 
The answers lie within and without ! You were\ 
experiencing\ 
\life energy\ " in its universal and infinite wisdom ! " 
Lazing on a < PROPFEMALE > afternoon 
Lost in thought and lost in time 
going to Rythm < PROPMALE>'s house 
in springfield till thursday 
saw the < PROPMALE > miller band at the taste of chicago today !!! 
Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain\ 
And you are young and life is long and there is time to kill today\ 
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you\ 
No one told you when to run , you missed the starting gun 
Strangers passing in the street\ 
By < PROPMALE > two separate glances meet\ 
And I am you and what I see is me 
im losing my mind .... 
Drifting on the wings of freedom 
AP studio < PROPMALE > hw /: blahhh figuring out a concentraion piece is hard ! 
It's summertime and the living is easy 
accept life as it is 
For my life's too short for waiting when I see the rising sun\ 
Then I know again that I must < PROPFEMALE > on 
I'm in a brightness I can feel surround me 
Wake up and look around you\ 
We're lost in space\ 
And the time is our own 
i really don't want to bother to put my schedule up ... im eventually going to find out if i have class with someone i know 
chilling with Rhythm < PROPMALE > 
Adjusting on my way\ 
To do the things I do everyday\ 
So many things to think\ 
Not one thing to say 
Live like you wanna live and stay where you wanna stay 
senior pics at 12 
do a power point at the last minute ! 
I can see beyond the eyes . A sometimes unfortunate gift . 
adventure time with finn and < PROPMALE > .... best show ever 
blue\ 
law sunday , monday got the blues , tuesday makes you wear your cryin'\ 
shoes . Wednesday , Thursday , Payday-Friday , i guess im just the son of a\ 
saturday night 
The sun also rises\ 
As night walks into day 
out trail blazing 
life is confusing 
Take a look into tomorrow\ 
When everything is gray 
A man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers , \ 
But awakes to a morning with no reason for waking 
out on the trail 
Not one thing to say ? 
i guess im going to the game tonight ... 
i want this rain to stop ! 
one body , one life ... i guess i better make the best of it 
thanks to Rhythm < PROPMALE > i never would have known about the harvest < PROPFEMALE > in the morning

Waiting for someone or something to show you the way 
Comes a time\

It's better to burn out\ 
Than to fade away
