There is no beauty inherent in a sunset . But , the myriad feelings the colors invoke within one's heart , the imagery that takes us back to a time of being a child . Reminiscence of games imagined , of dragons and the brave knights who struggle against them , of dancing with a loved one , twirling on feet as light as air and being wrapped in the warmth of the one you love the most . Therein lies the beauty of a sunset .
