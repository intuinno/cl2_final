Friday was the first time I broke down and cried for 2 hours striaght . 
Why is it that god put me on this earth just to be screamed at by those i care about ? 
Each day is a test that reveals more about me that I didn't even know . 
Today we live in a world of hatered and violence . Tomorow .. well don't expect a tomorow with the way we live . 
The day we all get along will be the day we lose our humanity ... 
I have had it with theses people making me the bad guy ! 
From what I've learned in this recent conflict i've had is that there is a time to fight and stand up for yourself and theres also a time to just give up when you know you will lose . I'm giving up for good . 
Well time for me to leave .. Das Vadanya
