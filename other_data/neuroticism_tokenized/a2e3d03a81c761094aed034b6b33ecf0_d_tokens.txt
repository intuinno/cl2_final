You're the hardest book I've never read , you have your own story to tell .

i love how my sister's friend 3-ways me into a phone call with them so my sister can ask me a question , i'm two rooms down from her . lazy people . 
I sat and smoked and thought about needles flipping back at the top of his Zippo , spinning the wheel , making fire with the flint and steel like a caveman . -The Night Shift , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . 
breaking my new year's resolution has never felt so good . 
you will never know . 
i'm actually going to clean my room . 
i'm sick and tired of all this bullshit . 
while i'm at it , i'll just eat a thousand < PROPFEMALE > needles . it'll probably leave a better feeling in my stomach than this . 
well , i trip over everything you say . 
this . sucks . 
ouch . 
greattt .. 
so apparently i'm a scenecore hipster according to < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > .

I'm giving up , on giving up slowly .

Like really ? Wow . 
How come , this can't be you ? :p 
Step it up , before I just step out . 
Call me a safe bet , I'm betting I'm not . I'm glad that you can forgive , only hoping as time goes you can forget . So you can forget . 
I dislike you , please stop texting me .. 
This could be the last time . 
I think my brain is about to have a meltdown from this weekend . 
Just won silver for my dress in scholastics ! AHHHHH ! 
you make me giggle . x ] 
Your hipocracy is actually really rediculously hysterical . 
I really don't know what I'm going to do with myself . I'm a wreck . 
So it's not gonna be easy . It's gonna be really hard . We're gonna have to work at this every day , but I want to do that because I want you . I want all of you , for ever , you and me , every day . <3 
I want someone provocative and talkative . 
I really want a shamrock shake . 
I don't pity you . And chances are , I never will . 
We believe in something invisible . 
If I could get this feeling to end . With trembling idle hands , holding me there . We laugh in the face of love . Because nobody's really there . Nobody's real . 
i want to go to the park today . 
i'm just giving up . 
I think I'm going to go outside and take pictures . 
All we need is a little bit of momentum , break down these walls that we've built around ourselves . 
:/ 
I hate being sickkkk . fgdkfjsgdsfjkg . 
Dear sick , please go away . 
Well , this just sucks . 
These rules were made to break and these walls were built to fall . 
You've got a dark heart . You've got a cold kiss . 
I kindof really wanna do something tonight . 
I'm stuck inside this rut that I fell into by mistake . 
When it all falls down , I'll still be right here . 
You would rather bleed than be without her . Gone are the tender whispers dancing in your ears . Replaced with lackluster memories you cry , your screams play in your empty room . 
I just found all of my old music . Oh thank god . 
Tell me darling , where do we begin ? 
This is the oldest story in the book , he desires the one thing he cannot have . 
Call me a safe bet , I'm betting I'm not . 
And for some weird reason , I actually started to feel bad for you . 
rawwrr . 
dislikeee . 
float my boat . 
I'm really liking today , actually . 
Oh god , thank you for letting me be born into a harcore < PROPFEMALE > family . <3 
Are you freakin ' kidding me . Ugh . 
Finally getting my permit tomorrow . 
I'm quite excited for saturday . 
I wish I can hear your voice . Don't leave me alone in this bed . 
I swear , I feel like my internal organs are just going to burst inside me . 
Hey , thanks for being there for me . 
I would beg for you , but I don't kneel . I understand you were living there , it never bothered me that I don't care . I wonder if I'll act on my impulse , I wonder if I'll leave if you say go . 
-1 , +10 . I like this math , ( : 
You're only cute when you're drunk . 
If I could , I would shrink myself , sink through your skin to your blood cells , remove whatever makes you hurt , but I am too weak to be your , cure . 
Going to < PROPFEMALE>'s with < PROPFEMALE > McGinty . Oh warm days , I love you . 
Today was a very good day :] 
????? ? u ?? ? sn ? ? ' ? oq ? o

Today was truely great . 
Late night < PROPFIRST > Gerhart conversations ... Erin : so i'm getting to that delirious tired again . < PROPFIRST > : awww :( Erin : just tried to eat a light bulb . 
Some men die under the mountain just looking for gold , some die looking for a hand to hold . 
And all I need to know , is that I'm something you'll be missing , is that I'm something that you're missing . 
Haha . < PROPMALE > Hardy makes vodka . 
Still sick :[ but now thanks to < PROPFIRST > Gerhart , I'm watching The Sandlot . 
Needles and pins , Needles and - Needles and pins , Needles and pins , Sew me a sail To catch me the wind .

My throat is so swollen . :[ 
< PROPMALE > Pfautz brought me < PROPFEMALE>'s :]

What have I gotten into this time around ? I know that I had sworn I'd never trust anyone again , but I didn't have too . You had me at hello . 
Making a pie with my papa . 
Take heart , sweatheart , or I will take it from you . 
A heart that's harder than stone , and it hurts a whole lot , but it's missed when it's gone . 
Went to homecoming in a sling , and will now most likely be going to prom in a boot/cast . Greeeeat . 
\I'm not spitting on you .. think of it as me blowing you a thousand concentrated kisses . \"" 
Got my X-Rays today .

Camping with < PROPFIRST > ! :) 
Got the most bamf fire idea then it started raining and pulled a bug out of < PROPFIRST>'s nose . Cool beans . 
And I've always lived like this , keeping a comfortable distance , and up until now I had sworn to myself that I'm content with lonliness , because none of it was ever worth the risk . Well , you are , the only exception . <3 
I wrote this song about you , isn't that cliche of me to do ? It's nothing for you , the band just needed something more to play . So don't blush or hooray at the possible sound of your name , no I wouldn't go that far . 
Laughing myself to sleep . 
Took < PROPFEMALE > swimming today .. 
Was that necessary ? 
Oh man , I ALMOST forgot how cool you were , but that refreshed my memory . I'm obviously being sarcastic , and you're pathetic . 
\That's like a hundred square frogs . \"" 
So brown eyes I'll hold you near , ' cause you're the only song I want to hear , a < PROPFEMALE > softly soaring through my atmosphere .

The greatest thing you'll ever learn , is how to love and be loved in return . 
I really don't want to go to school tomorrow . Going to the brownstown CTC was probably the worst decision of my life . 
Every single prom dress I want is like a million dollars . 
Whatever . 
Blah :/ 
I have the cutest boyfriend ever <3 
Control your poison , babe . 
No one will ever see these things the way I do . 
I like when my brother imitates cats . 
I wish I never would have went to CTC . So for all of you juniors thinking of going to the brownstown campus , don't . 
I want a tattooo ! 
New phoneee . 
Watching stepbrother with my babe <33 
Got my license !!! 
Went to the park and had a lovely picnic with < PROPFIRST > :) 
To the little < PROPFEMALE > that comes in my room and takes my things : I know who you are and you're not fooling me . Stop taking my things and pretending you don't know what I'm talking about . 
Blah . 
Free ritassssa 
Free ritasssss ! 
< PROPFEMALE > 
Sick :( 
So keep the blood in your head , and keep your feet on the ground . Today's the day it gets tired , today's the day we drop down . 
I'm so glad you're mine . 
Cherrrry ! <3333 
I really wouldn't hate school as much if it started after noon . 
It's not that I keep hanging on , I'm never letting go . <3 
So there was a stink bug on the edge of my mom's glass , and without looking she drank it , then spit it all over her new laptop . 
Stupid . 
Please be mine forever <3 
RIP < PROPMALE > . I never knew you personally , but I know you'll be missed greatly . 
My boyfriend is the cutest <3 
' Cause I'm a wishful thinker with the worst intentions , this could be the last < PROPMALE > you get to drop my name . If I'm just bad news , then you're a liar . 
I need girlfriends .
