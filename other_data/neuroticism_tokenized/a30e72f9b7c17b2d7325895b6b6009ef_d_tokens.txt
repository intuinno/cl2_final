I'm Not A Thief , I'm A Treasure < PROPMALE > . 
I am so tired of you acting like somthing you're not . I hate the fact that you're playing a little game and getting all these people to join in . It's so stupid . There are people that are against somthing you're doing but you don't tell them what's really going on . You make me sick . 
Listening to Metallica ! Oh , it's been a while . :) 
I belive my day was just ruined . And now , I hate you so much more . 
Count your blessings . 
My mother and I just spent fifteen minutes on Google Earth trying to find our house . Once we did that , we followed our morning route to school . Haha , we're stupid . 
I think that was the best sixth hour we've had in a long time . (: 
I just laughed for the longest time about a cage . Thanks < PROPFEMALE > . 
Zero hour sucks . Once you're already awake and ready to go , you get a snow day .. 
510 hours untill 2010 .

Person : \Do you shave your toes ? \ " Me : \ " No ... Why ? \ " Person : \ " I do . \""

\Olga put pool and pool in same room . \"" 
< PROPFEMALE>'s coming over then we're going to < PROPFEMALE>'s . (: 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas . (:

< PROPFEMALE>'s here . Shhh , don't tell Barend or < PROPFEMALE > , she got fake eyelashes . 
Well , my plans aren't quite set in stone yet . I could be doing two things later .. But , I've got one thing for sure , I haven't listened to BMTH for a while . And it feels good to be back listening to my husband's amazing music . (: 
Bye 2010 , you won't be missed .

So there's this chick , I'm not sure but I think her name is < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Jones , and she's one pretty fly person . She makes me laugh a lot . Most of the laughs are about a certain muskrat that is under the spell by an evil witch , and yes people , this is real life . So , I love this person . She sure isn't black , but she's asain . Some of my favorite classes are with her . :) 
I love how some people can just make you happy by talking to you . (:
