long before He laid the earths foundations , he had us in mind , had settled on us as the focus of His love , to be made whole and holy by His love . long , long ago He decided to adopt us into His family through Jesus Christ . Ephesians 1:4 -5 . <3 
CORRECTION : Long ago , even before he made the world , God loved us and chose us in Christ to be holy and without fault in his eyes . His unchanging plan has always been to adopt us into his own family by bringing us to himself through Jesus Christ . And this gave him great pleasure . Ephesians 1:4 -5 . ? everyone happy ? :)

is good for ur health . 
The one who sows to please his sinful nature , from that nature will reap destruction ; the one who sows to please the Spirit , from the Spirit will reap eternal life . Let us not become weary in doing good , for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up . Therefore , as we have opportunity , let us do good to all people , especially to those who belong to the family of believers . Galatians 6:7 -10 <3
