“I believe God is deeply saddened by this , just as we are , but for years we’ve been telling God to get out of our schools , to get out of our government and to get out of our lives . And being the gentleman He is , I believe He has calmly backed out . How can we expect God to give us His blessing and His protection if we demand He leave us alone ? ” - < PROPFEMALE > Grahm 
I believe that everything happens for a reason . \ 
People change so that you can learn to let go . Things go wrong so that \ 
you appreciate them when they’re right . You believe lies so you \ 
eventually learn to trust no one but yourself , and sometimes good things\ 
fall apart so better things can fall together . \ 
~ Marilyn < PROPMALE > 
i did it . blocked forever . out of my life . thank you God . 
Confront the\ 
dark parts of yourself , and work to banish them with illumination and\ 
forgiveness . Your willingness to wrestle with your demons will cause\ 
your angels to sing . Use the pain as fuel , as a reminder of your strength .. 
\Forgiveness is a rebirth of hope
