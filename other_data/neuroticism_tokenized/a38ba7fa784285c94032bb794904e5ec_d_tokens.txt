You know your going through global warming when .... its 107 degrees in Maine , and the Ocean temp is about mmm lets say , bathwater ? 
There comes a time in life when you walk awayfrom all the pointless drama and people who create it , and surroundyourself with people who make you laugh so hard that you forget the badand focus on the good . Life is too short to be anything but happy . Repost this if you agree ... 
i don't understand how people can be so puzzling .

Every person has 1000 wishes . A cancer patient only has one : to get better . I know that 97% will not post this as their status , but I know that my friends will be one of the 3% and put this as their status , at least for an hour , in honor of those who died because of cancer or are still fighting it . 
\smooth\ " AHAHAH < PROPFEMALE > Polirer ur hilarious ! xD " 
Don't settle for anything less than what you deserve , because in the end , you realize it was a huge mistake and next time , you wont make that mistake . 
The truth is a very key thing , however telling it to another person ... especially under the circumstances , can be one of the hardest things ever done .
