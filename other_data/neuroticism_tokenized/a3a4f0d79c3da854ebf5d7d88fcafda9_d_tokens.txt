When all of these things suddenly came together around 2000 , Nilekani said , they '' created a platform where intellectual work , intellectual capital , could be delivered from anywhere . It could be disaggregated , delivered , distributed , produced and put back together again -- and this gave a whole new degree of freedom to the way we do work , especially work of an intellectual nature . \
