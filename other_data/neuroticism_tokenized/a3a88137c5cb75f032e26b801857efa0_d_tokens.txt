Halloween party on Saturday the 30th , nobody make any plans :P 
Has there ever been a time in your life , when you feel the need to eat fish and chips ? 
But still I have faith , and still I read the signs . \ 
And they are indeed there . Some of us are lost and will not find our way , no matter what the signs say . \ 
Some of us do not see the signs because we are too busy shopping . \ 
Some of us do not see the signs because we can't help but stop and look at the accidents , and stare . \ 
We are in a daze , we are amazed by the world's displays . 
Why do all the bad things always happen on one day ? Seriously , if one bad thing happened every day , you could plan for it . Seriously , guys . 
REMINDER ~~~ Halloween party on Saturday , guys . Bring whoever you like , show up sometime after 8 pm , and stay as long as you can . \ 
Please don't bring food , my fridge can't hold the leftovers :( \ 
And to whoever has gamecube controllers , we need extra for super smash . Yussss . 
Almost walked down the stairs to the beach , instead of going to math class . It was so shiny and warm ... :( 
Just got a printer . Quick , send me something print-worthy ! 
With sadness so real that it populates\ 
The city and leaves you homeless again\ 
Steam from the cup and snow on the path\

After flipping through chapter 8 of my math textbook , i've realized that it doesn't merit a 2 hour bus ride and 3$ just to go to mission viejo to have someone read it to me for 3 hours . \ 
So ... no school this week :D 
7am is an ungodly hour . Is the sun even up that early ??? 
Why I'm thankful for my friends on thanksgiving ;\

Our generation's children will just have to look harder to find good music . We had to . 
Too heavy with the weight of your problems to fly away ... \ 
That's ok , \ 
I've convinced my self that I'm happy here anyway . 
At the hour when we are\ 
Trembling with tenderness\ 
Lips that would kiss\ 
Form prayers to broken stone . 
And so with an end to finals come great tales of fantasy and high adventure >:D 
No school or work tomorrow , no mom at home all day , nothing to study for or worry about but how I'll spend the next month :P 
A list of all the things you want in life , and at the top is always the one thing you can't have . So you try to find something to fill that space , but you don't know what . And so we're all searching for something , not knowing what it is we really want . 
I , < PROPFEMALE > S . Vandever , never have to take another Mathematics course for the rest of my time on this earth . 
Tuesday night Christmas dinner ... anyone's welcome to drop by any time after sunset :P 
\Where the hell are we ? \ " \ 
Waking up with a headache , stomach sickness , and intense hunger(and needing a shower badly ) , all without the help of alcohol . I manage to be allergic to life for another day . 
When was the last time I stayed up till 3 am playing video games with a bunch of friends ? Fuckin ' awesome you guys . 
The streets of Los Angeles <3 
And they'll feast , feast , feast , feast ! They'll eat their Who-Pudding and rare Who-Roast Beast ! 
Christmas is about realizing , \Oh yeah 
Final Fantasy XIV ! 
\What better than call a dance ? \ 
Why do you lie ? \ 
do you think I'll see you any differently\ 
knowing your past or what you've done or what you think about things ? \ 
It doesn't change\ 
who you are now , or \ 
what I think of you\ 
and if it does I'm not all that great of a friend . 
\Yessir ? \ " \ 
Turn on computer\ 
Switch on ps3\ 
Watch movies . \ 
( repeat x 3 days ) 
Ok , guys . I'm turning 21 . On Saturday we're going to JJ Bakery and The stickey-pickey to make PuriKura , and then the traditional < PROPFEMALE > Garden b-day dinner followed by a movie at my house . Later ( after midnight when I'm actually 21 ... ) we're getting drinks and bringing them back to my house for epic times . 
Yes . Night to get drunk . Things are going to get friskayyyyyyyyyy i <3 women . Pretty . Women . 
gtfo my facebook plz , and < PROPFEMALE > is 21 ! :DDD 
Thanks for the best Birthday ever , guys . I feel very loved :P 
No school or work for a whole day ...??? 
Dying for a new adventure . 
Everything is vaguely confusing right now . Very almost concerning . 
Quick ! A Distraction ! 
15$ < PROPFEMALE > Playground concert in San < PROPFIRST > on the 29th ... hah . 
All the world has closed her eyes\ 
Tired faith all worn and thin\ 
For all we could have done\ 
And all that could have been . 
The youngest of my children has gone off to school/work ... who will I cook for and clean up after and beat over the head now ??? 
Super hungry , not tired , have to wake up in 6 hours ... but there's a ps3 right over there ... 
So far , I have not found the science ... but the < PROPFIRST > keep on circling me . 
Fear and Loathing ... >:D 
How I've missed you , kitchen . 
Listening to euro dance music while killling zombies ... sounds like so much more fun than doing logic homework right now . 
The socially gifted cashiers at trader < PROPFIRST>'s make me feel like a shut-in , by comparison ... 
So apparently , I've been to Las Vegas twice . My Uncle and Grandparents were members of the bowling league , and they took me with them one year when I was 2 . 
What use could one man have for 2400 toothpicks ??? 
Hey , guys ! So ... best overall gaming headset(price , comfort , general awesomeness) ? 
Ra-ra-rasputin , lover of the Russian < PROPFEMALE > , it was a shame how he carried on ... 
Went to a black metal concert , and while waiting in line , our voices were drowned out by screaming Bieber fangirls . How can so much badass-ity and such fail-ness exist in the same few yards ? 
Hope you got your things together . \ 
Hope you are quite prepared to die . \ 
Looks like we're in for nasty weather . \ 
One eye is taken for an eye . 
I've dropped my phone . It now thinks it is 8:34 pm on a Sunday , December 31st 2006 . 
And a bag of Little Caesar's Crazy Bread later ... 
????????????????????????????? \ 
?????????????????????????????????? 
Best thing ever , is looking in the fridge at 11pm , tired and hungry , and seeing a take-out bag of leftovers that your mom brought home from some amazing restaurant . 
But you should never be embarrassed by\ 
your trouble with living , \ 
because it is the ones with the sorest throats \ 
who have done the most singing . 
Well , we're doin ' mighty fine , I do suppose , \ 
In our streak of lightnin ' cars and fancy clothes , \ 
But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back , \ 
Up front there ought < PROPFEMALE > be a Man In Black . 
I would pretend to buy your lies and excuses , sir , but I'm afraid I have no bullshit left in my wallet . 
The pretty little fish goes for the biggest , shiniest lure . The greasy fisherman reels in the first fish that tugs at his pole , gives it the once-over to see if it's a good catch , and , if not , pulls out his hook and tosses it back into the sea . And that's usually the end of that . 
So many good concerts , so little ... car ? 
Plunging toilets at work , cleaning up cat vomit at home , the hole in the bag I brought to walk the dog ; I think someone's trying to tell me something ... 
Throats hoarse from long conversation , comprehension growing , not from long years or any commonalities , but from the will to understand and the \thereness\ " of two people in one moment of time . " 
Oh , look at you , so cool with your three fingers together and the smoke and lips on the glass , the many girls you reel in and the ones you wipe off your shoe at the end of the day ... everyone is watching and looking at YOU , but you are just a movie character and whether they liked you or not everyone walks out in the end . 
To all my friends who give me rides to/from work , school , concerts , parties , etc ., the bus is lame and riding my bike in the rain with a fever sucks . Also , <3 . 
Grilled havarti cheese sandwich with asparagus , < PROPMALE > mustard , salt and pepper with boudin sourdough and some grated parmesian ... 
Those words I can't find , \ 
I wonder , what dimension \ 
they go to in my mind ? 
Sick for almost a month now ... this is nonsense . 
The elitist UC system has decided that it's students shall not fraternize with the lowly CSU/community college student body , and that's why we all have different spring breaks and will never see each other again , the end ... 
Pizza and Batman : The Animated Series , sounds like a good time to me . 
Comedy and fantasy literature mated , and the offspring is , unfortunately , indigenous to the UK . 
I trapped a spider in my wastebasket , so I could clean off my desk . I forgot to let him out . :( 
No school tomorrow or Thursday :D 
Walked/biked around town for an hour ; saw dolphins and came home with steak . Outside ftw . 
Ah ... I'm 21 , and tomorrow's St. < PROPFIRST>'s Day ... I feel like I should do something , but is anyone NOT locked down in finals-mode ? 
Anyone who's in town , BBQ at my house saturday night :P 
Remember , people ; BBQ at my house , show up after 6 , at 7 for food . < PROPFIRST > Party and Smash , bring drinks and gamecube controllers if you have them :P 
Come to my house people , chicken-kabobs and kosher dogs(and cucumber sandwiches of course ) 
I hate it when people talk about me on the phone . When I'm right there . And make stuff up . And repeat things I just told them as if they figured that out about me on their own . And totally get things wrong D: 
my hands are slow mutants ... type , damn you ....... 
BAD MOOD GTFO !!! 1 ! D:<
