happy first week back to all my teacher friends ! 
trying to figure out how to get all this done before monday !!! :O 
wondering where all the time goes !!!! I take wayyyy too much time to do things . .... 
How was the first day of school ?! 
Wow . Made it through the first week with not probs except how to do attendance on mainframe !!!! ;) it takes me like 20 minutes to take roll :( 
Thank you so much for your prayers everyone . I am still in shock . There will be little rest until her murderer is caught . My mother wouldn't hurt anyone , anyone who knew her ...

Project De-Stress is not going so well ... Hate to be negative , but ... Does anyone else feel like all u do is work ? I have been working since I was 16 . I think the only time I didn't feel stressed was when I stayed home after Zac was born for a couple years before I got divorced . Those were the days :) 
I know the solution 2 our nation's education problems is 2 reduce the number of students teachers teach . It's ridiculous how many students middle N high school teachers R responsible 4 . I have 4 classes and 130 students , N then 22 swimmers . If we R expected 2 call parents 4 behavior , grades , keep up w/ Tardies & absences , follow up on detentions , and Grade all their essays , I'd like 2 know how we R 2 have a life ...
