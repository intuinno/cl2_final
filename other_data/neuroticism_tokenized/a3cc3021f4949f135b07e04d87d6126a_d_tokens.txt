Oh my goodness , Sandi ... it is such an embarassing story . I was standing on our bed , at 11:30 at night , looking for < PROPFEMALE>'s diploma so we could have it framed , and my foot slipped off the foot of the mattress . At the foot of our bed is a horizontal railing that goes from post to post ... I fell , and as my foot slid down , I cataputed off the bed . I have to make this in several mailings , sooo ... 
I heard a distinct snap before I got halfway down , and when I landed on the floor my ankle was laying flat .. at a right < PROPFEMALE > to my leg . < PROPFIRST > stabilized my ankle and carried me to the car . It happened four weeks ago and two weeks ago I had surgery . Yesterday the cast came off and PT starts Friday . Here's the last installment ... 
My daughter , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > , is getting married in 2 1/2 weeks and I have to be there for the wedding ( at West Point , where < PROPFIRST > and I were married ! ) So , here I am recuperating . And any and all prayers are gratefully welcome . How are you , dear heart ? Have you been down to Sarasota to your darling grandbabies ? I do miss you , dear friend . 
Hi < PROPFEMALE > ~ How are YOU doing ? I miss you like crazy !!! Remember the night we were last together at Dutch Heritage , last October , you had < PROPFIRST > with you and I took your picture ? I have that picture on my refrigerator and I see you every day ! I am going to be in Sarasota for Christmas ... are you ? I hope we can get together ! Love you ~ m 
Bless your sweet heart ! We'll be in church on Sunday ... we have to go to < PROPFEMALE > tomorrow so we won't be home . I'm not supposed to put any weight on my ankle , so I'm still in a wheel chair , but God is blessing me in the process . Hope your shoulder is doing well ... : ) The wedding was wonderful and we had a really great time . Thank you for thinking of me . : )

This is part two of a three part message ... < PROPMALE > wrote that he's stopping in on his way up to Annapolis ... he and < PROPFIRST > are hysterically funny together ... < PROPFIRST > graduated from West Point and < PROPMALE > graduated from Annapolis ( the Naval Academy ) and when we were in Italy in 2001 , they were horsing around and < PROPMALE > turned to < PROPFIRST > , grabed him and kissed him !!! < PROPFEMALE > Cox caught it on film and gave me the picture ! 
This is part three ... read the other 2 first or you won't know what I am talking about ! They are sooo funny ! Their nicknames are Guido ( < PROPMALE > ) and < PROPMALE > ( < PROPFIRST > ) , named after those two litle Cars characters ! This is getting really long ... sorry . I hope you have a blessed Easter , < PROPMALE > , and that you get to relax and have some time for yourself . Hugs ~ < PROPFEMALE >
