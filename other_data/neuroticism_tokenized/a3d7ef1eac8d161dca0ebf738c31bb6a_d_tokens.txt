Hold your breath . 
The further you go , the less you know . You're born to quit , you've blown it . You need to let go , of letting go . You're full of shit , you're born to quit . You've blown it , you're born to quit . 
Uuuhhhhh ....... So yep our ( the universe and mine ) cycle is back in full swing so I'm just gonna do it again :/ 
Take a ride and cut on through things will reach you from this place . Barely making sense it's true we'll disappear and you can't trace . You don't know her name but anyway . This you can't check in I feel the same . Can't remember much it seems dig my stance I couldn't sleep . Piece together everything broadcast from the outside in . You don't know her name but anyway . This you can't check in I feel the same . 
Yeah ... so you can go fuck yourself now :) 
Jeesh , when my dog < PROPFEMALE > gets fussy it's like having a baby in the house ! I'm sure Mom and Rowdy agree , huh ? 
Here by my side , you are destruction . Here by my side , a new color to paint the world . Never turn your back on it , never turn your back on it . Here by my side , it's heaven . 
What's better than kissing in the rain ? Kissing in the snow . 
Oh gosh , I can't even believe it's been a year ! SO crazy 
Yellow's not a gang color , right ? :] 
Nothing that I can't hold onto with my broken hands , I'm not thinking that I should anyway . So I leave holding nothing , don't care what you say . Cause it makes no difference if I throw it away . Yeah , it makes no difference if I throw it away . 
Homework needs to go die . 
He < PROPFEMALE > , I just took of my shoes and noticed that I'm wearing my big fuzzy socks :P 
Hey get your things , it's time to go . \ 
You make me glad I'm not alone . \ 
In silence we hear the tires upon the road . \ 
I turned to you and asked you why , \ 
You're so awake , you must be tired . \ 
You say when we're apart , \ 
You'll close your eyes . \ 
This is beautiful . \ 
This is beautiful , \ 
Unmistakable . \ 
This is beautiful . 
Sometimes I get so tired , \ 
Just trying to find a place to lay my head . \ 
I don't want to die . \ 
I dont want to waste another day , or night . \ 
I know there's something more , \ 
than what we're living for , \ 
I see it in the stars , \ 
I feel it on the shore . \ 
I know there's something more . \ 
I think we're all afraid , \ 
that we might be alone , \ 
alone down here . \ 
We all want to have some faith , \ 
to just believe . 
Yeah , and fuck you too . 
Snow ? 
People are people =^P 
Hey Guys , Hey Guys ..... Fuck Thanksgiving 
Trading heartbeats\

When the sun goes away we will hide , \ 
In the warmth of a dark summer night . \ 
In the face of what we are not ready to be , \ 
We'll sing , \No it's not our time to go . \ " \ 
Heyyy , read my new note and tell me what you think :) It's my entry for the \Love What's Real\ " writing contest :P "

I just fell in love for the first time . Watch as I pick myself up off the ground . In the dark I'm so far from the spot light . Can you see me now ? I turn my back and walk away , away from the pain . Scream aloud drown it out by the sound of the rain . Listen up , I've had enough of all of this waiting . I need you more now than I ever did . 
Shopping \funnn\ " today . Gosh I need to get away from here . "

Things I saw last night : People bbqing on their roof with a head lamp , Stripper < PROPFEMALE > without a shirt on , Lady < PROPFEMALE > , and thousands of quarter sized snowflakes . 
Air wolf .... just like the land shark 
Every saint has a past and every sinner has a future . 
I come alive as the shadows parade . \ 
My hot summer blood comes in floods and in waves . \ 
Curbside confessions , no longer afraid of what you'll say . \ 
And I find you , twilit beyond all the cars . \ 
In driveways they sleep , but streetlights will keep watch over me . \ 
They flickers like stars . \ 
And now the secrets carefully kept inside run the streets red , \ 
Our chemicals spread , washing us through , making you mine ... 
< PROPMALE > Cheney has no pulse . 
Moving truck outside , I'm off to Oklahoma . \ 
These walls we painted are getting painted over . \ 
I'm scared I'll fall asleep , I'm scared to say goodbye . \ 
Who knows how long we'll make it last tonight ? \ 
Goodbye , bear\ 
I'm heading out the door , \ 
Then falling off the map . \ 
I'm never coming home . \ 
I'm sorry I couldn't ask you , \ 
I couldn't offer you my life . \ 
Now it's all in boxes , \ 
Cause sometimes , \ 
You have to let love die . 
Pale and perfect , such unholy heaving . The statues close their eyes ; the room is changing . Break my skin and drain me 
It's gone cold now\ 
We'll sleep somehow\ 
I'll be gone by first light\ 
Last < PROPMALE > hold tight\ 
Until then\ 
I lie awake\ 
And memorize your face\ 
As you sleep next to me\ 
The falling < PROPFEMALE > is calling me\ 
As I leave 
Speak through fingers , the awful edges where you end and I begin . 
Hello , my name is your T . V . \ 
We've been together so long , \ 
So many memories . \ 
We solved so many problems , \ 
Situated comedies . \ 
I fed you ads and movie stars , \ 
And you always fell asleep in my color bars . \ 
But there's this world outside\ 
Where the lighting's off ;\ 
Scenes last too long , \ 
And you lose the plot . \ 
All the girls they lie , \ 
And they break your heart . \ 
And nothing's done when the streets go dark . 
I'm entering my poetry in a magazine contest :) 
Don't speak 
I long for blackness\ 
Blackness and silence .... \ 
It's like I'm hollow\ 
Like I've never felt\ 
Like I never thought 
Hmmm ... I want to write something but idk yet .... :p 
Fucking weird ...... 
Fuck you laundry !! 
Can you feel my trigger hand , moving farther down your back when you hide , hide inside that body ? But just remember that , when I touch you , the more you shake , the more you give away . Wait another minute here . Time will kill us , after all . Can you feel its second hand , wrapped around you neck ? Fall into my eyes , fall into my lies . But don't you forget , the more you turn away , the more I want you to stay . 
Christmas !!! Ahhhhh :) 
Shit ! I think I just overdosed a fish : 0 
Umm well < PROPFEMALE > Christmas , I hope all you had a great one , I know I did :D and also .... Crystal Callahan Rowdy Vandeventer < PROPFEMALE > Nebeker , AQUATIC AVIARY INTERCOURSE !!! XD 
The bridge is crossed , so stand and watch it burn . 
I want you stuffed into my mouth , \ 
Hold you down and tear you open , \ 
Live inside you .. \ 
Love , I'd never hurt you ... \ 
\ 
But I'll grind against your bones\ 
Until our marrows mix . \ 
I will eat you slowly .

At McDonald's last night the guy gave you the wrong kind of McFlurry , so you screamed at him , \YOU MCFUCKED UP . \"" 
Gahhh I love The Horror of Our Love :D 
Narnia ..... One word : Trippyasfuck o.O 
She is everything to me , \ 
The unrequited dream , \ 
The song that no one sings . \ 
The unattainable . \ 
She's a myth that I have to believe in , \ 
All I need to make it real , \ 
Is one more reason ... \ 
I don't know what to do , \ 
I don't know what to do ... \ 
And she makes me sad ... 
Hahaha this just made my day :) \ 
canibolisticgumybear : \ 
\Damn Twitards .? \"" 
It seems our day keeps falling on a leap year 
I really , really cannot wait to get out of here : X 
Ahhh ... nothing like eating cotton < PROPFEMALE > trix yogurt , listening to a song about a prostitute < PROPFIRST > by a gay man , and staying up past 3 :D 
Inspiration has struck !!! It's poem time :) 
They said that the writing on the wall should be \no one really cares \"" 
I know , things aren't quite like what they used to be . Different faces , different places yeah . We can try , oh we can try . 
I don't wannnaaaa :'( 
I'm so sad ... I spent most of my christmas break sleeping so I feel cheated out of the same time everyone else got :( 
My ear hurts :p 
Still we breathe with broken lungs , \ 
We act like none of this matters . \ 
Is this what we meant , when we said , \ 
That we'd sing what must be < PROPFIRST > ? \ 
Are we fools and cowards all , \ 
To let them cover up their lies ? \ 
Cause we all watch the buildings fall , \ 
And watched the scales fall from our eyes . 
Drying up in conversation , you will be the one who can not talk . All your insides fall to pieces , you just sit there wishing you could still make love . 
So we'd leap from the < PROPMALE > , and we'd hear the wind sing , a song that's too perfect for words .... 
The boat and the blade , they are all that I know . \ 
The sea calls my name , and so I must go . \ 
And while they still sleep , I slip out the door ... \ 
But how can I leave , with my anchors ashore ? 
I know the ocean speaks , I've heard her call to me ... \ 
And smiling in my dreams , she whispers this :\ 
\Can you see the sky turn red 
Ahhh well my speech went well ... I think lol . Drinking tangerine white tea out of my purple Puerto < PROPMALE > mug :) 
Steer clear of the sun , \ 
Or you'll find yourself in the sea ... \ 
Won't you look at your wings ? \ 
They're coming undone , \ 
Splitting at the seams . \ 
For once won't you listen to me ? 
* Everybody has*\ 
-Tried to catch a grape in their mouth . \ 
-Wrote on the mirror after a shower . \ 
-Tried to stand on a ball hanging on to nothing . \ 
-Balanced a switch between top and bottom . \ 
Baahahahaha repost , you know it's true !! 
And everything still moves in slow\ 
Motion , \ 
Breathless and blue and be-\ 
Hind your eyes , \ 
The sea ... \ 
Oceans of\ 
Light envelop me . \ 
But things can't be as\ 
They seem ... \ 
I'm so far from home . \ 
This must be another dream , \ 
But my eyes are\ 
Open . 
Tee < PROPFEMALE > I just sent this from my phone :) 
A child of dust , to mother now return ;\ 
For every seed must die before it grows ... \ 
And though above the world may toil and turn , \ 
No prying spade will find you here below . \ 
Now safe beneath their wisdom and their feet , \ 
Here I will teach you truly how to sleep . 
Every sixth song of The Alchemy Index series by Thrice ends with the same < PROPFEMALE > !! WAYYYYY cool :) 
Do you know what winks and screws like a tiger ??? 
You know you live in homedale when you hear people in your class talking about hay ..... 
Just saw some kid that was completeky taped together ..... O.o

I got a new fish :) 
Gosh life is weird sometimes :) 
GAAAHHHH !!! What a night :D 
Heyyyy Kendallllll , I cant ' t get on again tonight cause mom is using the computer . :p You really should get online more often lol 
The water's rising now and we will surely drown 
This is horrible but I understand . I guess I expected more but you know whatever . I'll be out of here soon anyway . 
Uproot the flowers\ 
And fill the holes with blood 
And I don't know what to do\ 
But sit here and wait\ 
For the end of the world 
O bruise yourself , intoxicate yourself , \ 
Dilute yourself . \ 
You want to web the rivers of the world . \ 
You want to glue the tides together with yourself . \ 
You look so innocent-\ 
Water wouldn't melt in your mouth . 
This movie is FANTASTIC . Dinner for Schmucks XD 
Pizza for breakfast ?! I think so !! 
Stars fall like dust\ 
Our lips will touch\ 
We speak too much 
O bruise yourself , intoxicate yourself , \ 
The window is a mirror . We see ouselves upon it . Passionless , it seperates our flesh against our flesh until we sleep alone . 
Everybody's growing up :) Awww ... It's pretty funny to realize that all those movies we used to watch when we were little are based on people our age and younger :p 
Guess what I'm doing !!! Baking a mother fucking cake !!! 
Stupid phone , keeps turning off when I send messages :/ 
Ahahaha swedish twister's fun :) 
I thought it would be nice\ 
To lie down and close my eyes\ 
It never occured to me\ 
That I was already asleep . 
GAHHHHHHHHH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! TOMORROW IS MY LAST DAY AT HHS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Soooooo ..... Tommorow I get to sleep in , then go to boise and do stuff , then go to register at 2 , and then go look at apartments with < PROPFEMALE > sister :) 
She's like a stupid/darker version of < PROPFEMALE > Bynes ... Guess who I'm talking about :) 
I know this hurts , it was meant to . Your seceret's out , and the best part is , it wasn't even a good one . 
e're only good for the latest trend . We're only good cause you can have all those famous friends . Besides , we've got such great fashion sense ... 
6:60 .... Also called 7:00 hahaha 
You are the truth\ 
I'm screaming these lies\ 
Saving my life 
Ohhhh goodness , I'm OFFICIALLY a Boise Brave hahaha 
I watched you change\ 
Into a fly ... \ 
I looked away , \ 
You were on fire\ 
I watched a change , in you ;\ 
It's like you never had wings . \ 
Now , you feel\ 
So alive ... \ 
I've watched you change 
Keep the image\ 
Playing in my head\ 
There forever\ 
Swirls\ 
Spirals\ 
Unfolding into\ 
Skeletal hands\ 
Water flowing\ 
Lost in the movement\ 
Percussive wheels\ 
Interrupting the stillness\ 
My thoughts\ 
Lost in the distraction\ 
But the image\ 
The image\ 
Keeps forever\ 
Playing in my head 
So yeahh .. tonight was fun : rocking out to Gojira , drinking each other's peace teas , squeegeeing the windows , and waiting for Mikey for foreverrr in the parking lot with < PROPMALE > Sharp , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > :) 
I am drowning , \ 
In a digital sea . \ 
I'm slipping , \ 
Beneath the sound . 
Put your hands in the air and don't make a sound \ 
But don't get the wrong idea , \ 
We're gonna shoot you , \ 
We're gonna shoot you . \ 
And there's nothing in your head or pocket , throat or wallet \ 
That could change just how this goes .. 
Gahhhhhhh tomorrow's my last day off D: 
I had a dream , \ 
It seemed so real , \ 
It made it hard to feel . \ 
It fades away , \ 
And I forget more everyday\ 
But I don't think I'll ever forget you . \ 
I've never wanted to stay asleep this bad before . 
GOODBYEEE HOMEDALE ahahaha 
Sooo my journalism class has a shopping cart in it .... 
Wheww .... first day = over . Now comes the hard part :p 
Ahh season 4 is out :)

2 hours of geometry tomorrow D: 
There are sprinkles ....... in the cake batter ..... o.O 
I love Time To Pretend :D 
Back in homedale wooo :) 
Good day :) 
Let's make some music , \ 
Make some money\ 
Find some models for wives ... \ 
I'll move to < PROPFIRST > , shoot some heroin\ 
And fuck with the stars . \ 
You man the island and the cocaine and the elegant cars ... \ 
This is our decision , \ 
To live fast and die young . \ 
We've got the vision , \ 
Now let's have some fun ... \ 
Yeah , it's overwhelming , \ 
But what else can we do ? \ 
Get jobs in offices , \ 
And wake up for the morning commute ? 
Drunk on shadows and lost in a lie , \ 
Killing ourselves a kiss at a time 
Tell me what you know about dreamin ' , dreamin'\ 
You don't really know nothin ' , nothin'\ 
Tell me what you know about them night terrors every night\ 
5 am , cold sweats wakin ' up to the sky\ 
Tell me what you know about dreams , dreams\ 
Tell me what you know about night terrors , nothin'\ 
You don't really care about the trials of tomorrow\ 
Rather lay awake in a bed full of sorrow 
So life is just a bit like\ 
I am not here\ 
And there isn't a way for\ 
Me to escape\ 
Not when I'm so hollowed out\ 
And my legs shake\ 
Too hard for a simple word 
\ 
To leave my lips\ 
And a fucking stare leaves bliss 
Yeah , I'll miss the boredom and the freedom and the time spent alone ... But there is really nothing , nothing we can do . Love must be forgotten , life can always start anew ... 
I just realized that i've been posting just lyrics , poems , and cool music videos for the past week .....

Wow I really did have an awkward hug on awkward hug day with out even knowing it was today !!!! 
The smorgasboard is this Saturday right ???? I want my paintings back lol 
How weird .... I don't feel any different 
There's a tractor on the street outside my house ........... 
Fuuuuuuuuckkkkkk . I hate it when I get in these moods :/ 
Jesus Christ ! Keep your judgments to yourself . \ 
On a lighter note , My cat is a fat ass and vanilla soy milk tastes like sprinkles but less sugary ..... 
We had to choose , we made our moves , and now we gotta go . Why's this make me so nervous ? Why does everything go wrong ? 
When you play a high d on flute it becomes very easy to whistle ..... 
Lesson #9 \ 
dont eat tree sap . No how good you think it may taste , trust me it doesnt . 
Our lives are clocked to make my timing just right . Would it be ok , would it be ok if I took your breath away ? And i wasted away away from you . 
Read between the lines , we can't give in this time\ 
Just let me go for now I'll be just fine\ 
Don't you know , don't you know now that I'm back on my own 
Yeeeesh my geometry sub's name is Howdyshell ..... 
The thing about dreams is , they can only haunt you until the fever breaks . 
oooooooohhhhhhhhhhh THUNDER and RAIN and THUNDER and RAIIIIINNNN :D 
All along the eastern shore , put your circuits in the sea \ 
This is what the world is for , making electricity \ 
You can feel it in your mind \ 
Oh you can do it all the time \ 
Plug it in and change the world \ 
You are my electric girl 
Are you afraid , afraid of the thruth in the mirror staring back at you ? The image is cracked but so is the view . 
Don't fear , the sun . Feel like , someone . Some hell , some hell . Come on 
Dress your wounds\ 
Test your strength\ 
Face the night\ 
Crave the touch\ 
Feel the pain\ 
Know the signs 
Well I may be a sinner , but it wasn't me this time . Just keep your mouth shut ; keep your gaurd up . I swear I'll make it right . 
Some people are just lucky , you know ???? 
There's this chick in my geometry that keeps whistling the < PROPMALE > Griffith theme song :/ 
Wooooooooooooo !!! Just finished the first season of Glee !!!! XD

Remember Kids Next Door ??? #5 was always my favorite lol 
WOOOOOOO new season of Bones is on netfilx !!! 
Bones marathon :) Reminds me of summer lol 
There's so many people that I identify with and the funny thing is that I know them too well to actually get to know them :p 
If you ever say never too late , I'll forget all the diamonds you ate . Lost in coma and covered in cake , increase the medication and share the vows at the Wake .

Veronica : \Nannannannanna\ " \ 
We talk to much . \ 
We talk in circles , \ 
' Til we're all spinning round , \ 
Reaching for rings , \ 
On this merry-go-round . \ 
The scenery spins , \ 
We call it progress . \ 
I've seen this all before . \ 
When all said is done , \ 
Wake up on the floor . 
 ? 9I keep telling myself , I keep telling myself , I'm not the desprate type . Sitting out dances on the wall , trying to forget everything that isnt you . I'm n 
 ? 9ot going home alone , cause I don't do too well on my own . 
Hey hey heyyyy , calm down lol I think more people need to die anyway :p 
Dinner = A shit ton of brocolli and an < PROPFEMALE > blend java monster :) 
Heyy hey you , shut the fuck up . Yeah , I mean it :) shut the fuck up . 
I am starting a campaign to slaughter the world . If you start feeling sick and puke blood , it's because I've poisoned you . Think of it this way , if you die now , you won't have to suffer through the mass terror and panic that I shall create . I care .... You're welcome . 
Soooo ..... I have totally convinced < PROPFIRST > that I shaved my head and that now I have a mohawk .... He's not that bright sometimes :) 
I've never wanted to stay asleep this bad before . \ 
I was so close to making you within my world . \ 
I saw your face . \ 
I felt your hand . \ 
I fell in love all over again . 
Guysssss you should make twitter accounts :) it seems pretty cool lol 
PIE DAY !!!!!!! WOO 
The Girl you just called fat ? She has been starving herself & has lost over 30lbs . The Boy you just called stupid ? He has a learning disability & studies over 4hrs a night . The Girl you just called ugly ? She spends hours putting makeup on hoping people will like her . The Boy you just tripped ? He is abused enough at home . There's a lot more to people than you think . Put this as your status if you're against bullyin 
Just downloaded sheet music for The Corpse Bride and < PROPFIRST > Scissorhands :) Kick ass 
GLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE :) 
: C is < PROPFEMALE > much sadder than :( 
Hmm walking home in a blizzard . You should try it some time , it's EMAZING 
Fuuuuuuuuuuuccccccccccckkkkkkkkkkkkkkk . Things are just so messed up right now but at least life goes on . 
ROAD TRIP !!!!!!! Eh not really ..... 12 hours o.o

Internet !!! Wooo 
Dude ...... There's 10 more Mondays until summer vacation .... 10 . 
Just watched < PROPFEMALE > Black's Friday video ...... lmao but it's sort of sad .... 
Well , I may be a sinner , but it wasnt me this time . 
Ohhhhh gosh !! i'm going to go that that new movie < PROPFIRST > as soon as possible :) 
Yet again ..... Fuuuuuck You . 
 ?  < So I'm sitting in the music building and coming out of one of the practice rooms is the sound of a guy jamming on the bass , the moonlight sonata , and ano 
 ?  < ther guy going crazy on the drumset :) 
Hmm the talent show was cool lol 
When we hope , we usually hope for the wrong thing . We yearn for tomorrow and the progress that it represents . But yesterday was once tomorrow , and where was the progress in it ? Or we yearn for yesterday , for what was or what might have been . But as we are yearning , the present is becoming the past , so the past is nothing but our yearning for second chances . 
Sometimes I wish that I had never gotten so involved ... Most of the time I wish you hadn't tried so hard to get me to talk to you . Fucking health class in 2009 , you screwed me over twice . 
We are alone , the world is not our home . We breathe the air , we care . We feel the pain , we can not explain . There are no words , to be heard . 
This is more awkward than having sex with a rhinocerous who doesn't love you anymore ..... 
I miss myspace :'( 
Bed time I guess ? Pshh why and why not ? 
My fish , Shake , is going crazy in the tank . Lmao he's literally making the water slosh around 
What's your name , and what do you play ? 
Could it be you're really here ? \ 
' Cause my eyes are open , \ 
And everything still moves in slow , \ 
The sea , \ 
But things can't be as , \ 
They seem . \ 
But my eyes are , \ 
I'm being left\ 
I'm being right\ 
I'm being wrong\ 
I'm being left- \ 
Behind\ 
I'm being up\ 
But mostly down 
Stories by Trapt is a wonderful song :) 
Believe me , I'm just as lost as you . 
Gosh I can't wait til June so I can get that tattoo :D 
I have a bopit !!! 
My retainer makes me lisp pretty badly :/ 
You may tire of me , because our December sun is setting , and I'm not who I used to be . 
Heeyyy .... You're like a turtle ... Backwards .... 
 ? LShould have done something but I've done it enough . By the way , your hands were shaking . Rather waste some time with you . Should have said something but 
 ? LI've said it enough . By the way , my words are fading . Rather waste my time with you . 
< PROPFEMALE > is just so amazing :D 
Way down , < PROPFIRST > the grave , where the searchlights find us drinking by the mausoleum door ... And they found you on the bathroom floor 
Get a fucking mattress yo ! 
I'm losing my sight , losing my mind . Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine . 
Keep your head above water 
Going to prom on the 24 with < PROPMALE > lol spent all last night getting a dress :p guess what color it is .... 
Fuck ... I get all worked up and I'm so tired of it :/ 
Make it count 
Sorrow drips into your heart through a pinhole , just like a faucet that leaks and there is comfort in the sound . But while you debate half empty and half full , it slowly rises . Your love is gonna drown ... 
1234 bang 
I wish I could wright you a letter that you could read . 
There's no way to go but up from here , but up from here . Take your time , don't bother me with shallow alibis . It's your life , and your decision , to do nothing with it . So admit it now , admit it now . 
Can you see the sky turn red , \ 
As morning's light breaks over me ? \ 
Know tonight we'll make our bed , \ 
At the bottom of the sea ... \ 
Can you see the sky turn red ? 
Don't fear the sun 
I don't quite know , \ 
How to say , \ 
How I feel . \ 
Those three words , \ 
Are said too much , They're not enough . 
 ? ZShatter the seal between my lips , \ 
I want to feel my screams . \ 
This sidewalk describes life , \ 
Up and down , \ 
Pieces torn out . \ 
I'm gasping for breath , \ 
It escap 
 ? Zes through my fingertips , \ 
I can't help reaching for it , \ 
But he keeps himself from me . \ 
What were you thinking ? \ 
Don't cave in , \ 
You know where you'll end up 
 ? Z . 
All that I am , \ 
All that I ever was , \ 
Is here in your perfect eyes , \ 
They're all I can see . 
 ? \\The daylight seems to want you as much as I want you . It's been minutes , it's been days . It's been all I will remeber . Happy lost in your hair , and the c 
 ? \\old side of the pillow . 
I'm getting the concert butterflies :) 
Might actually be ...... Bi-Winning :) 
This has , been said , so many times that I'm not sure if it , matters . But we ne-ver stood , a < PROPMALE > , and I'm not sure if it matters . 
We traveled all night , we drank the ocean dry , and watched the sun rise . You can ask about it , but nobody knows the way . 
 ? ^I woke up , \ 
And wished that I was dead . \ 
With an aching in my head , \ 
I lay motionless in bed . \ 
I thought of you , \ 
And where you'd gone , \ 
But the world , \ 
Spins 
 ? ^madly on . \ 
And everything , \ 
That I said I'd do , \ 
Like make the world brand new , \ 
Or take the time for you . \ 
I just got lost , \ 
And slept right through the dar 
 ? ^k , \ 
And the world , \ 
Spins madly on . \ 
I let the day go by , \ 
I always say goodbye . \ 
I watched the stars , \ 
From my window sill , \ 
The whole world is moving , \ 
But I 
 ? ^'m standing still . \ 
I woke up , \ 
Wished that I was dead . \ 
The night is here , \ 
The day is gone , \ 
And the w 
 ? ^orld , \ 
Spins madly on . \ 
And the world spins madly on . \ 
Spins madly on 
 ? ^ . \ 
And on\ 
And on 
Aww I love < PROPFIRST > :) 
Why don't you want to get a hotel room with a pokemon ? Cause they'll pik-at-chu in the shower hahahaha 
I had a dream , it seemed so real . It made it hard , to feel . It fades away , and I forget more every day , but I don't think I'll ever forget you . I've never wanted to stay asleep this bad before . 
I like people who take really creepy pictures and don't even know it :) they make me feel like less of a wierdo 
You were my fire , \ 
So I burned , \ 
Til there was nothing left of me . 
Fuck you iTunes I don't have the < PROPFEMALE > to deal with your shit right now :p 
One last kiss , \ 
Before i go . \ 
Dry your tears , \ 
It is time to let you go . \ 
One last kiss 
All the words are gonn bleed from me , and I will think no more . 
I'm a cupon !!!! 
It's poetry carved in flesh , its beautiful held our eyes . 
Touch my tears with your lips , \ 
Touch my world with your fingertips . \ 
Who wants to live forever ? \ 
Who dares to love forever , \ 
When love must die ? 
I'm on break and listening to Alkaline Trio :D 
 ? dThere's a lightning storm , \ 
Each and every night , \ 
Crashing inside you , \ 
Like motorbikes . \ 
We toss and turn , \ 
Sleep so loud , \ 
Grind the teeth in our , Our empt 
 ? dy mouths . 
I know it only hurts\ 
When your eyes are open , \ 
Lives get exhausted , \ 
Truth is spoken . \ 
It only hurts\ 
When the door is open , \ 
Dreams are lost\ 
And hearts are broken . 
Wooooo festival :) 
Air biscuits ? 
Will you still love me when you see what I've done ? Will you still kiss me the same when you taste the hint of blood ? 
Save me , take me home when I come up for air . 
This emptiness . \ 
I've made my home . Embracing memories\ 
Of dreams long gone . \ 
One last caress\ 
From the corpse of love , \ 
Is all I want , \ 
Underneath the\ 
Cyanide Sun . 
Omg late start tomorrow anddd I'm going to bed more than an hour early . I'm gonna get so much sleep !!!! 
To write with a broken pencil is pointless .... Hahahaaaaa get itttt ?

Damn suicidal pigeons lol

I have never seen someone fit so much play doh in their poket before :o 
 ? sWe know that there is comfort in a world , where darkness is the only thing we see and the cold is all we have to breathe . Where expectations keep us comp 
 ? sany , where the lights we turn into ice while rolling down , are somehow out of our control . 
 ? uNow you're saying that it's late , \ 
It doesn't matter what I say , \ 
You know you're just another one of my mistakes . \ 
You are so beautiful , \ 
You are the kind 
 ? uof girl , \ 
That has the chemicals , \ 
That makes me fall in love . 
And down below , \ 
Your veins run dry , \ 
Your vacant eyes . \ 
I lost control , \ 
Your face is pale , \ 
Your body's cold . 
Heyyy strawberry Nesquik powder in water is actually pretty good :) 
I love How I Met Your Mother :) 
But now I'm trying not to think about it too much because that makes it worse . It's kind of like when you look at yourself in the mirror and you say your name . And it gets to the point where none of it seems real . Well , sometimes , I can do that , but I don't need an hour in front of a mirror . It happens very fast , and things start to slip away . And I just open my eyes , and I see nothing . 
You make me sick 
Movie marathon today :) Love And Other Drugs , < PROPFEMALE > Movie , Aeon Flux , and now It's Complicated . 
Laid his hands on her coffin , \ 
Head filled with thoughts and empty , \ 
He took them away , \ 
Leaving warm hand prints . \ 
Left them there as a last reminder of his touch . 
Last night ...... I SPIT OUT OF MY NOSE . 
Just cleaned out my friends listy thing 
I'm still amazed by how empty we can be . 
< PROPMALE > ate her baby !!!! :O 
 ? Sing it for me , I can't erase the stupid things I say . You're better than me , I struggle just to find a better way . So here we are , fighting and , trying 
 ? to hide the scars . I'll be home tonight , take a breath and softly say goodbye . 
Wow , honestly my shirt smells like sunshine :D 
Cynical , that's what I am . I haven't been able to describe it that well but I guess that's how I am most of the time . 
Woaaaaahhhh man ..... I'm cleaning out my fish tank : 0 
Got a couple of couches , sleep on the love seat . :) 
Shake just died : C 
Damn those prom pictures we're horrible :p 
 ? Sitting in this room playing Russian Roulette , finger on the trigger to my dear < PROPFEMALE > . Out from the window see her backdrop silhoutte , this blood on my 
My body tells me no ... Oh but I won't quit , cause I want more 
Can you whisper ?

Gonna get it on my my left side right beneath my hairline going from like up towards my ear to the back of my neck and some < PROPFEMALE > around it and that's gonna disappear beneath my hair and like fade off down my neck !!!! Much better than my leg :D 
Ok soooooo I think we should start saying woman-slut or woman-whore instead of just whore or slut . Andddd men should just be called sluts and whores !! Jk lol we're equal . 
Dammmmmnnnnnnnnnnnn I need to stop this lol 
I feel really slowwww today :) 
My \clean mint\ " toothpaste tastes like tangerines :o ....... it MUST be my birthday :D " 
 ? »If it were death\ 
I would admire the deep gravity of it , its timeless eyes . \ 
I would know you were serious . \ 
There would be a nobility then , there would be 
 ? »a birthday . \ 
And the knife not carve , but enter\ 
Pure and clean as the cry of a baby , \ 
And the universe slide from my side . 
My last status was from The Birthday Present by < PROPFEMALE > Plath .... Get it ?! Cause it's my birthday hahaha

Holy fuck . It's summer :D YES . Anddddd I'm so happy :D cause it's gonna get warm , and then I'll go swimming :D 
Songs anyone ? I'm kinda bored lol 
Plants , as far as we know , \ 
Are still bending toward the light , \ 
And if we dance until the heart explodes\ 
It'll make this place ignite . \ 
And even if this hall collapses\ 
I can stand by my pillar of hope . \ 
It's just a case of flash delirium . 
Back and forth , the stuggle consumes us all , trying to keep a level head . 
That's the sound of forgiveness . Screaming and then silence . :D 
Just watched I Love You < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > :D It's my favorite now . Epic love story with clever plans and just amazing cuteness hahaha 
That's how it starts , \ 
The thoughts . \ 
When they come , everything changes ;\ 
You can't go back . 
Gaaaahhh i wanna go do something :p 
Representative Weiner sent out a picture of his wiener ..... Does no one else see the irony ?!?!

I see you , but I can't feel you anymore . So go away . I need you , but I can't need you anymore . You hesitate . 
Gahhh this is so unbelievable :O Stop it youuuuu 
Let me know , is your heart still beating ? 
The beauty in the eye of the storm , \ 
Is where I stand when I feel your grace\ 
I forget about my pride and my place ;\ 
Just take me from here , take me from here . \ 
Even if it rains and the sun wont shine\ 
Whatever the weather , you'll be mine ;\ 
Let's watch the rain fall and wash away our innocence . 
Super excited for Warped this year :D Some great bands are going :) 
Bury all ur secrets in my skn\

You know what would be great Facebook ??? Being able to just like regular people hahaha 
Blacktop letters written out in chalk\ 
That she might see me\ 
When school is over . \ 
Dripping thoughts fall onto your sidewalk\ 
I could only tell you\ 
When I'm not sober . \ 
It's not your fault . \ 
Cryptic message written in the dark\ 
All that haunts me\ 
Is surely closure . \ 
Locking hands floating through the park\ 
They always watch me\ 
Losing composure . \ 
It's not your fault . 
Watching Super High Me lol 
Why did the little strawberry cry ??? Cause it's mom was in a jam ... HAHAHAHAHA :D 
I like clothes you can wear backwards and get away with :) 
Why give up ? Why give in ? It's not enough , it never is . 
I like watching Carney try to swim backward :D my fat fish is cute hahaha 
Toss another skull on the fire and roast some more bacon :) 
And I'm stronger now , \ 
And I'll scream out , \ 
I'll make them listen if it kills me now . \ 
Speak up my dear . 
You always thought I left myself open , \ 
But you didn't know , I was already broken . \ 
I told myself it wouldn't be so bad , \ 
Pulling away took everything I had . \ 
You tried to lie and say I was everything ;\ 
I remember when I said , \I'm nothing without you . \ " \ 
Scanning a bunch of old pictures !!! When I get done I'll upload them :D 
We can only stay this high , if we let no one take us down . 
Call off the guards , it's hard enough to get you alone as it is . \ 
Well turn off the camera , and start acting natural ;\ 
Let me see who you truly are . \ 
So what's the difference between who you are , \ 
And who you should be ? \ 
I tried my hardest\ 
To break you out of\ 
The shell you're hiding in . 
I was told I'd have the last word\ 
Don't take that away from me . \ 
I'm holding on tight to my charm\ 
And I was told that was the final straw ;\ 
I said , \That's not the first time\ 
I'm tired of putting in my two cents , figure it out , fuck you . 
Hey < PROPFIRST > ! If you're online come meet us at the park ! 
Oh and bring some matches lol 
Yep :) 
@ < PROPFIRST > Hunt just used my teeth to scratch his elbow .. 
Still haven't seen the new version of Skins :p 
Goodbye . We're facing the same thing over and over . You're repeating yourself , and it's boring me to tears 
Though I only ever gave you love , \ 
Like every child you've chosen to rebel . \ 
Uprooted flowers and fill the holes with blood . \ 
Ask not for whom they toll the solemn bells . \ 
A Child of Dust to mother now return , \ 
For every seed must die before it grows . \ 
And though above the world may toil and turn\ 
No prying spade will find you here below . \ 
Now safe beneath their wisdom and their feet\ 
2:12 \ 
You're a headache waiting to happen 
Made a new Vampirefreaks account :) Mannn it's been too long 
Going swimming :) vicious fishes hahaha 
Homedale is wild , but the next town is Wilder . Hahaha get it ? Wilder ? Cause thats what its called . Ahahahaha 
1-800-HARDWOOD 
Can't go to the Pride parade tomorrow :/ Gonna be in Nampa at my Dad's :o 
Yeah ! He is so sexy hahaha 
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface\ 
Consuming , confusing . 
I feel like I'm starless , I'm ready to fade now . And now I feel like I'm starless , I'm ready to burn out . I gotta get you out of my flames , I gotta get you out of my plans . I gotta get you out of my steam , I gotta get you out of me . 
Something in the closet right next to me made a rasping noise ..... I'm not sure what this means .... 
Because I cannot break anymore . 
Fuuuuuck . < PROPFIRST > Dunn died l : C What's gonna happen to Jackass ? 
DAMNNNNNNN Beck's voice does not match his face :O 
Fucking bed haha :D 
It's only as dark as you make it 
I cannot feel what you've done to me , what you've done to me . So for now , take this down a notch , crash my car through your window . 
Grandma < PROPFIRST > to her dog : ' You little ... You know what you are ... ' haha she sounded so sinister o.O 
Girl , I'm gonna fuck the taste out of your mouth . XD 
Fuck yes ! I'm watching Cyberchase ! 
I hope I'm one of those uber creepy people that other people just go * buhhhh * when they see me :) Just for giggles :D 
For your sake I hope Heaven and Hell are really there , but I wouldn't hold my breath . You wasted life , why wouldn't you waste death ? 
I've got , a big fat fucking bone to pick , with you my darling . In case you haven't heard I'm sick , and tired of trying . 
Did I want love ? Did I want to know ? \ 
Why does it always feel like I'm caught in an undertow ? \ 
The moths beat themselves to death against the lights , \ 
Adding their breeze to the summer nights . \ 
... \ 
You said that you did , but you didn't understand . \ 
I know that starting over is not what life's about , \ 
But my thoughts were so loud , I couldn't hear my mouth . 
You were scaring me to death , the way you never seemed to care at all . I couldn't take , the shots you took , at me for trying to effect the way that you would end up . And I don't know , where I'm going , but I'm never coming home . 
Fuck this . You don't care ? I don't care . 
I didn't mean most , \ 
Of what I said before . \ 
So just forget that , \ 
Before it sinks to your core . \ 
I'd never want you , \

We're building towers , with no foundation , just stacking stone on stone ... \ 
Whatever it takes , mix our mortar with bones . \ 
True progress means , matching the world to , the vision in our heads . \ 
We always change , the vision instead . \ 
We set sail , with no fixed < PROPFEMALE > in sight . \ 
We drive by , braille and candle light . 
Well you know I hardly speak , \ 
When I do it's just for you . \ 
I haven't said a word in weeks , \ 
' Cause they've been keeping me from you . \ 
There's a way where there's a will , \ 
You know I've got no need for stairs . \ 
Step out on the window sill , \ 
Fall with me into the air . \ 
Here we go , \ 
Hold on tight and don't let go . \ 
I wont ever let you fall . \ 
I love the night , \ 
Flying o'er these city lights , \ 
But I love you most of all . 
For all the years of emptiness , for all of my mistakes , \ 
For all the years I've thrown it all away , it's not too late . \ 
For all the years I've thrown it all away , those days aren't gone forever . \ 
I can change , I can change tomorrow ... \ 
All of my mistakes , I can change , I can change\ 
I can change before it's too late . 
Hey !! What's a door that isn't a door ????

Ok so yeah .... I'm going through in my mind all the guys I'm crazy attracted to and I've come to a conclusion .... I like square jaws and high cheek bones with short-ish hair and nice shoulders :O Jus sayin hahahaha 
Depression is a little like happy hour , right ? \

Dive into each other , and hold our breath forever . \ 
I could get used to this , \ 
Acting without thinking , \ 
Knowing that it's wrong to do , but do it anyway . 
Frozen inside , without your touch\ 
Without your love , Darling . \ 
Only you , are the life\ 
Among the dead\ 
All this time I can't believe I couldn't see-\ 
Kept in the dark , but you were there in front of me . \ 
I've been sleeping a thousand years it seems , \ 
Got to open my eyes to everything . \ 
Without a thought without a voice without a soul-\ 
Don't let me die here .. \ 
There must be something more , \ 
Bring me to life . 
I know your name , and that you're photogenic .. And tall . 
* face palm * I wish you would just open you're eyes . 
Why is it that we can't stand ourselves ? Why always wish we were something we are not ? Can't people just be satisfied with who they are ? 
I'm not jamming with Rowdy and he's upset D: I don't feel bad though because it's a bunch of techno stuff and I'm trying to type shit GODDAMNIT . 
VERIFIED --- On December 25th , 2011 Facebook will start charging you for your account ... To avoid this , you must get naked , stand on your dining room table , do the Macarena , all while singing '' I Will Survive '' ..... Then and only then will < PROPFIRST > Zuckerberg come down your chimney to tell you that your account will stay free ..... Paste this to your Walls or you will be transformed into a Goblin ....

Done , done , and I'm on to the next one . 
Let it die , \ 
Never want to say goodbye , \ 
But girl you make it hard to be faithful , \ 
With the lips of an angel . 
I've murdered half the town ;\ 
Left you love notes on their headstones . \ 
I'll fill the graveyards , \ 
Until I have you ... \ 
Moonlight walking , \ 
I smell your softness . \ 
Carnivorous and lusting , \ 
To track you down among the pines , \ 
Or so I've dreamed since I met you , \ 
I've been hollowed by your body , \ 
I've been hypnotized by all you are . \ 
All I want is to know your name , \ 
And whisper it in your ear , \ 
But I'm weightless like I'm falling on the moon . \ 
I'm falling slow for you ... 
I AM FULL OF NAPS 
At < PROPFEMALE>'s until Monday ....... WOOOOOO . We gonna drink orange juice ...... 
Scent of the day : chestnuts and brown sugar :D MMMM yeah 
Gosh you people ... Thinking you're cool and shit * face palm * hahahaha losers .... Jus sayin 
Me : Are you ready for this ? Cheyenne : No , I need to do my McBushes ... 
Good natured arguing makes me want to beat whoever it is with my shoe until the screaming stops ... and uncomfortable :/ 
If you leave here , she said\ 
Turn the lights off , I'm alone again\ 
Every place that I go\ 
Reminds me of you , you know \ 
I'm askin a lot\ 
For someone who's got\ 
With so little to give\ 
So little to give \ 
On my side , I can't deny\ 
I see your face and I back away\ 
And in between every scene\ 
There's a spot where she's kissin me 
YES ! I know I sleep with my mouth open < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > !!! Now you've woken me up and gone back in the bedroom ... what dicks . < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > have done this to me too D: Everyone just stares at me while I'm sleeping .. and it makes me uncomfortable when I wake up with people laughing and/or staring at me :d 
< PROPFIRST > from The Little Mermaid is a hoarder !!!! 
< PROPFEMALE > holding up a pot leaf belt buckle to me : ' Hey , this would match your belt ' Debbie : ' What's that ? ' Me : ' Umm .. ' Debbie : ' Are you a gardner ?? ' < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , and I : ' Uh huh ... ' Epic mall time :)

Jeeshhhh !!! 5 hours of dancing at bogies .. I'm beat :D Only guy I had fun dancing with was Zach the Nerd :D So cute hahaha \I just wanna pinch his cheeks \"" 
I've realized why I'm so unafraid of rats even though mom freaked me out about everything else she's scared of .... The Secret of NIMH . I used to watch this all the time at my dad's house :P 
So ... I've been watching the Rugrats :D 
Now I wait alone for death to come , \ 
Faded pictures so I know , \ 
No where to go , \ 
So I don't . \ 
Picture your ? body , \ 
Hearing your voice and fall into your eyes . \ 
Through crooked lines , \ 
The morning light faded pictures in my mind . \ 
Not scared of death , \ 
No I know , \ 
Picture your body , \ 
Hearing your voice and fall into your eyes . 
Guess who's going to learn how to use a sythesizer for her one-woman band .... \ 
<-- This chick ;) 
Ughhhh I HATE June bugs ........... 
So guess who's officially employed now ... 
And it's just like the ocean , under the moon\ 
And it's the same as the emotion that I get from you . \ 
You've got the kind of loving that can be so smooth , yeah\ 
Gimme your heart , make it real , \ 
Or else forget about it . \ 
I'll tell you one thing , \ 
If you would leave it'd be a crying shame .. \ 
In every breath and every word , \ 
I hear your name ... Calling me , out ..

There isn't a doubt in mind that you're for real ... This is just a bad idea for my mental health ... I guess we'll see what happens , just go with flow hahaha 
I forgot my twitter log in crap ... 
Drunk on ego , \ 
Truly thought I could make it right if I , \ 
Kissed you one more time to , \ 
Help you face the nightmare but you're\ 
Far too poisoned for me . \ 
Such a fool to think I could wake you from your slumber , \ 
That I could actually heal you ... \ 
Sleeping beauty , poisoned and hopeless

I've lost my goddamn mind , it happens all the time . I can't believe I'm actually , meant to be here . Trying to consume , the drug in me is you . And I'm so high on misery , can't you see ? 
Days seem like years in this month of December , \ 
The winter coldens me for I have yet to sleep , \ 
And never will I give up trying ' cause you're everything to me , \ 
I hope it's something worth the waiting , \ 
It's the only time that I ever feel real , \ 
Thunder storms could never stop me , \ 
' Cause there's no one in the world like < PROPFEMALE > , \ 
There's no one in the world like < PROPFEMALE > , 
Girls are weird o.O 
There's no where to go but up from here . 
Saw Captain < PROPFEMALE > with Cae and a mysteriously missing < PROPFEMALE > ..... EVERYONE DIES .. Jus sayin 
Pick up line : How much does a polar bear weigh ? \ 
Enough to break the ice .

Put this as your status , & whoever likes it thinks you're lying 
Run , < PROPFEMALE > run . \ 
A sexual being , run him like a blade , \ 
To and through the heart . \ 
No conscience , one motive :\ 
Cater to the hollow . \ 
Screaming , feed me here , \ 
Fill me up again\ 
And temporarily pacify this hunger that's so cruel . 
Woooo what a great day hahahaha 
Here we go , hold on tight and don't let go . \ 
I wont ever let you fall .. \ 
I love the night , flying o're these city lights , \ 
But I love you most of all . \ 
And there's something you should know , \ 
Girl , you should have died that day .. \ 
When you fell reaching for the rose\ 
But baby , I was there to save you . 
Lithium , don't wanna lock me up inside\ 
Lithium , don't wanna forget how it feels without\ 
Lithium , I wanna stay in love with my sorrow . \ 
Don't wanna let it lay me down this time , \ 
Drown my will to fly . \ 
Here in the darkness I know myself\ 
Can't break free until I let it go , let me go . \ 
Darling , I forgive you after all\ 
Anything is better than to be alone\ 
And in the end , I guess I had to fall

Just saw this sign ' Conquer yourself before the world . ' :) 
WARNING , PLEASE READ - If someone comes to your front door , and asks you to remove your clothes , and dance in your front yard with your arms in the air .. DO NOT do this , it is a scam !! They just want to see you naked . Please copy and post this to your status -- I wish I had received this yesterday .... I feel so stupid now . 
Guys , GUYSSSSS . I just watched The Lion < PROPMALE > . And I have the other two sitting here right next to me :D It's a Kodak moment !!!!!!! 
Oh , bruised and broken , \ 
My eyes are opened . \ 
I won't lose from this , \ 
Can you see\ 
In the distance ? \ 
No resistance ? 
I'm insane , \ 
Well , I can feel it in my bones . \ 
Coursing through my veins . \ 
When did I become so cold ? \ 
For goodness sake , \ 
Where is my self control ? \ 
If home is where my heart is , \ 
Then my heart has lost all hope . 
Yuckkkk 
Just got some hair straightener :D Let's hope it works !

IMPOSTOR .

I don't ever wanna feel , \ 
Like I did that day . \ 
Take me to the place I love , \ 
Take it all away . 
First day of work tomorrow .... Fuck . 
My color is Magenta ... \ 
Would I dye my hair that color ? Hmmm the underneath half haha\ 
What's my favorite food that color ? Rock < PROPFEMALE > :D \ 
What's my favorite animal that color ? Your mom's chest hair .... \ 
Like and I will give you a color : B 
Eyes of a fallen angel , \ 
Eyes of a tragedy .. \ 
Oh well . Oh well . \ 
Apparently nothing , apparently nothing at all . \ 
You don't , you don't , you don't , see me . \ 
You don't see me , you don't ... \ 
You don't . You don't see me at all . 
I'm wearing a yellow shirt for the first time since I was 4 ... 
HEY HERE'S ONE I JUST MADE UP . Why did the Soviet Union almost beat the Americans to the < PROPFEMALE > ? Cause they were Russian . Bahahaha 
So today ... Woke up at 8 , went and had a job like a real person , sat at < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > where Mom , Rowdy , and I all read books ( lmao we're nerds ) for like an hour , went to < PROPFEMALE>'s and ordered pizza , and then we watched Conan The Barbarian ... Bahahaha good times , good times . 
Went to sleep at 10:30 this morning .. Bahaha :) 
Hi , my name is < PROPFIRST > , I'm an addict . Hi < PROPFIRST > . :D 
Fucking asshole : l I'm done trying . Why the hell do you leave me out of everything but then say you wanna be friends ? Yeah . Screw off , < PROPMALE > . 
Air-conditioned love is always cold . \ 
I enter her room and it smells like before , \ 
Like rain and vanilla , she closes the door . \ 
The movement , the blurring , the echoing ache\ 
Of slow disappearing and smearing away . \ 
But now I'm a thief , I'm a transient freak , \ 
A discarded object I'm hated and weak . \ 
She's hollowed my chest and I've haunted her street . \ 
That ravenous < PROPFEMALE > , she's ravaged through me . 
What if all the world's inside of your head\ 
Just creations of your own ? \ 
Your devils and your gods\ 
All the living and the dead\ 
And you're really all alone ? \ 
You can live in this illusion\ 
You can choose to believe\ 
You keep looking but you can't find the woods\ 
While you're hiding in the trees .. 
I know , I should go , but I want to stay here with you\ 
In this room ; I can tell , you'll never be all mine . \ 
Never mine , ok . Never mine , ok . Never mine , ok . Never mine , ok . \ 
I know , you have to go , but I want to keep you to myself . \ 
Like a dream , I can tell you'll never be all mine . \ 
Never mine , ok . Never mine , ok . Never mine , ok . Never mine , ok . 
Then I let you go and I give , \ 
And before I put that gun to my temple , \ 
I told you this\ 
\And I would do anything for you\ 
Ughhhh have to pack up my room by 12 today ... What a hoe ... 
What do vegan zombies always want ? Grainssss 
School starts the 24th .... FUCK D: 
So I'll escape , escape to where I need to be ;\ 
The water's getting higher and I need to breathe . \ 
Where do we go now ? I'll ask you once again .. \ 
With our lungs gone-\ 
Our lives are gone . 
If you look at your reflection , is that all you wanted to be ? What if you could look right through the cracks ? Would you find yourself ? Find yourself afraid to see ? 
This is a horrible night . I just want to be able to believe someone for once . 
Two poems , three epiphanies , a deeper understanding of people , and I'm ready to sleep . Fuck the po-lice . Haha . 
I gotta find something to eat .... I don't really feel like it but I know I'm going to end up standing there at work really hungry .... 
Close my eyes , and move to the back of my mind , where worries are washed out to sea . See the changes , people's faces blurred out , like sun spots or rain drops . 
Gauging my ears again :) anybody have some 12-10s i could borrow ? 
\I don't know much about boats .. but it looks like that one's upside down . \ " Bahaha got off work at 10 then went and saw Cowboys and Aliens .. It was epicccc . That man is a babe . " 
You've been known to obsess over the future , \ 
Do you think youll get away from the past ? \ 
As you starve yourself just to make it through til midnight\ 
Consider what you might have found . \ 
You think you've got a good thing now ... 
I love people's lag-free smart phones :3

While I just sit and stare at you . \ 
Because I don't want to know , \ 
I didn't want to know . \

Mistook their nods for approval , \

Didn't go to band practice .. AGAIN . Cause a full school day and and hour of school shopping wore me out ... Being sick sucks , I'm totally going to be behind this season : l 
My policy : No stone throwing regardless of housing situation . 
In Homedale for the weekend ... Who wants to do something ? I'm bored :d 
Ocean ... WANT . :d 
When I have kids eventually , I just wont tell anybody about but then tell people when they're like 5 ... It'll be funny :) 
Ugh ... How late am I staying up tonight again ? 
If I told you that I knew\ 
About the sun and the moon , \ 
I'd be untrue\ 
The only thing I know for sure\ 
Is what I won't do . \ 
Anytime , anywhere , I must say , baby\ 
I wanna make it\ 
Again and again . \ 
I wanna make it wit chu\ 
Anytime , anywhere . 
GOING TO THE FAIR !!! I haven't been out and about for farrrr too long . See you there ? Bahaha 
Well goodbye to all that I knew , \ 
I'm leaving and you should leave too . \ 
I said all I needed to say , \ 
Now we can both be on our way . \ 
Well hello to you , < PROPFEMALE > road . \ 
... Was it as good as I have been told ? \ 
I heard that the stars were so bright , \ 
I hear that it was such a sight ... \ 
Show me the good times , \ 
Just make it come alive . \ 
I only want one night , \ 
Cause I've seen a bad life . \ 
We'll run all those rivers , my friend . \ 
I just want to say this to you , \ 
I loved all the things that you do . 
I ain't here to break ya , \ 
Just to see how far you'll bend . 
Everything tastes violent .... 
Ok ... So there's this really dumb show called H2O ..... And even though it's theme music is heinous , I can't stop watching it : l 
Want bed . Not homework . Fuck :/ 
Online textbook isn't working X/ \ 
Who likes doing Algebra homework anyway ?? Not this person who actually wants to get a good grade and keep up on everything .... 
Wake up , school , home , eat , sleep , band , homework , sleep :d 
Latinnnnnn homewurkk 
Accomplishments of the day : made a porcupine in ceramics , learned half the marching band drill in one practice :o , discovered some cool music , and got all my homework done for once :) 
Whenever I audition for American Idol I'm going to sing Yellow by Coldplay :) I'm just in love with it :D 
A child ? of dust , to mother now return ;\ 
You know what would make me very happy ?? Getting the full Alchemy Index and the new album Major/Minor by Thrice :D 
If I gave you the ocean , \ 
You would ask for the sun , \ 
But if I gave you that sunlight\ 
You would say it's not what you want . \ 
And I give , and I give , and I give , \ 
But I don't give up . \ 
There was a time\ 
When my best was good enough . \ 
Sometimes I wish I could walk away and not think twice ;\ 
I can't get past the thought of you in someone else's life . \ 
Can I keep you if I try ? \ 
Can I make it right ? 
Wooo ... Football game tonight , did you know that BHS plays at the BSU stadium for football ?? I didn't haha 
You're friggin hot and quite frankly , I want in your pants :D Also , 3 day weekend guys :) Who wants to < PROPFEMALE > out around Homiedale ? We can study !! 
Fuck dumb English teachers . I'm getting transferred into AP first thing Tuesday e.e 
Vin Diesel = male < PROPFEMALE > Fox . Know what I mean ?? 
Does death divide us all by light\ 
The same way as the day decides the night ? \ 
Is darkness just where it begins ? \ 
As I get closer does blindness set in ? \ 
Does death divide us all by light ? \ 
Are we buried beneath the ocean , \ 
Or have the bodies we once had\ 
All turned to dust ? 
Do you care if I , don't know what to say ? \ 
Will you sleep tonight , or will you think of me ? \ 
Will I shake this off , pretend it's all ok , \ 
That there's someone out there , who feels just like me ? \ 
There is ... \ 
Those notes you wrote me , I've kept them all . \ 
I give a lot of thought of how to write you back this fall . \ 
With every single letter , and every single word , \ 
There will be a hidden message\ 
About a boy that loves a girl . 
Stars fall like dust , \ 
Our lips will touch , \ 
We speak too much . \ 
Did you know\ 
That I love you ? \ 
Come and lay with me , \ 
And I'll love you\ 
Til the end of time . 
I'd like to say that you're my only fear\ 
And when I dream it slowly disappears\ 
And when I wake I'm right here by your side\ 
To feel your heart beat in and out of time . \ 
When the storm brings rain , snow , fate of all kinds\ 
You can feel almost anything . \ 
When the day seems to melt , fall flat in the night\ 
When you can't get up , you gotta get up and try .. \ 
This is it , can you feel me ? \ 
When the bombs come down , you will make it alive\ 
If you only , if you wanna believe . 
Bored outta my mind .... 
I feel like I can't wait to start living my life . Stupid thing is that I am waiting ! I'm waiting for something to come along and give me a reason or maybe the confidence to start it :d 
What do you get when you cross an elephant and a rhino ? \ 
El-efphino :D 
Ughhh ! I just freaking love Inception :3 \ 
And also , I'm bored and lonely . \ 
Who wants to give me their cats ? T_T 
I can't get you out of my head :d 
I've got waffles with blueberries :D 
You had time to waste\ 
And I'm not sorry . \ 
Such a basket case\ 
Hide the cutlery . \ 
I had time to kill , \ 
It's dead and buried . \ 
You've got guts to spill\ 
But no one trust-worthy . 
Passion or coincidence once prompted you to say , \ 
\Pride will tear us both apart . \ " \ 
Ughhh . No matter what I eat I'm still hungry : l I guess today I'm going to pig out and then tomorrow I wont eat anything haha 
I guess , I remember every glance you shot me\ 
Unharmed , I'm losing weight and some body heat . \ 
Eyes closed so hard , I stopped your heart from beating\ 
So deep that I didn't even scream , fuck me . \ 
I'll be just fine , pretending I'm not\ 
I'm far from lonely and it's all that I've got . 
Yogurt and Algebra 2 :[ 
Anyone want to come over and watch Dandelion with me tomorrow ? No ? Yeah .. I didn't expect anyone to lmao 
Also , I enjoy people who like feet .. Bahahaha 
Fish and chips haha ... \ 
Band was INTENSE Xd\ 
Fuck you schoooool . \ 
I'm out :D 
Nope :p 
There's a fine line , \ 
Between love and hate and I don't mind , \ 
Just let me say that I like that , I like that . 
Fucking love what I'm hearing of Major/Minor :D Can't wait til it comes out .. \ 
Also , I'm moving to my new apartment tomorrow !! I'm gonna have a pool right in my front yard XD 
I don't care anymore if I let you down , \ 
I believe that I need to be free . \ 
I'm so used to my life with you around , \ 
I don't know anymore the real me . \ 
And I thought that I found myself today , \ 
And I thought that I had control . \ 
All the chains in my life just fell away , \ 
For a moment I didn't need you . \ 
All these tears that I've cried , \ 
You must be tired of taking care of me but , \ 
It's what you do best , and I'm a liar\ 
Cause really it's what I need . \ 
#December 1st 2010 
WOO ! We're all moved in ! 
Carney died : C None of my fish survived the move ... I guess I'm gonna get a turtle lol 
I do it for the drugs , I do it just to feel alive . \ 
I do it for the love , that I get from the bottom of a bottle . 
What I'm really trying hard to get down into words , is the way I fit into this world ... But I never could take any more of this , cause I'm always going to get , get down to the floor . It's a cold gun that I kiss , because I cannot break , anymore . 
Went to school , then the mall for my paycheck , a dog park with < PROPFIRST > boy , cooked dinner , and now I'm baking a cake while I do my homework . It's a good day :D

They lived beyond a time with no worldly trifles to diminish their ardor or tarnish their love . To them , today was yesterday or tomorrow . Life an eternal moment 
You are my center when I spin away\ 
Out of control on videotape , on videotape\ 
On videotape , on videotape , on videotape . \ 
This is my way of saying goodbye , \ 
Cause I can't do it face to face ;\ 
I'm talking to you before . \ 
No matter what happens now , \ 
You shouldn't be afraid , \ 
Because I know today has been\ 
The most perfect day I've ever seen . 
Just breathe , \ 
The midnight air will do you well . \ 
Believe , \ 
I miss your taste , I miss your smell . \ 
The past mistakes that brought you here , \ 
Will break the fall for you my dear . 
Well hey , marching band's fun this year :) Got done with practice then took < PROPFIRST > for a run ... Wee : B

Never fall in love . Just don't do it . 
You've made it < PROPFEMALE > clear , \ 
You are the chandelier , \ 
And I am the floor beneath you , \ 
So low , I cannot reach you . \ 
You are , the constellations . \ 
You are , the stars above , \ 
Light years away from being something I could touch . \ 
And I , I , I've been\ 
Bli-i-i-nded by\ 
Your glow ' cause it shines like\ 
Oh oh ohh .
