Life can be complimented by just figuring out what my purpose is in this crazy . It's hard enough trying to figure out who I am . I just wish someone would help me see what purpose is in life . Even if it sheds just a little light on who I am . Or why I am here . I would like to know .

I swear . Everyone needs to grow up . Life isnt just about sex and destroying peoples relationships . You can also have friends , fall in love with somebody , gat a broken heart , get married , and yes , have a freaking like . Everyone just grow up . Sheesh ! 
I think my gothic side is slowly going into the closet and my goofy side is slowly coming out . This has never happened before . It feels really werid . What should i do ? 
My angel says the sweetest things . He says them when i least expect it and it gets me everytime . I miss him when he is not around .

There are some very scary clouds outside . A cold front and a thunderstorm coming in at the same time is actually kinda scary . I hope it doesnt get to bad . But with oklahoma , more then likely it will . 
The wind just picked up and it got dark really freaking fast . i hope my dad comes home soon . im a little worried 
if anyone sees a big yellow snake in oklahoma . im sorry but somehow he got out of my house . his name is mr. mousey and he loves being around children . and loves to go trick or treating with me . and u can persuade him with < PROPFEMALE > . his favorite < PROPFEMALE > is tootise rolls . 
For those who have had a broken heart , you know it takes a long time to heal . And you know that it is hard to let someone help you put the pieces together . So those who got a broken heart for the first time needs to listen to those who have had a broken heart . They will help you a lot more then you think . 
Can i get a hot tup ? 
Its been 9 years today since the attack in New York . It feels werid because i remember what i was doing that day almost perfectly . It almost feels like it happened yesturday . 
Guys turns ons . Half the guys like a woman with a very visible bra under a dirty wifebeater and riped up jeans and she is covered in dirt and grease from working on a old car all day . The other half is the female version of Sling Blade . 
What is it about me that attracts people ? I have been called unique , werid , and mysterious . I dont understand it . Whats so special about me ? Im just me . Thats all . 
Does anybody know if anybody is hiring from the < PROPMALE > area to the chickasha area ? i would like to have an idea of where i can at least apply . 
Those whove been in a relationship or 2 have prolly realized that a heart may have been broken from bein with sum1else . While the person is in the relationship may realize that it might be comin to end the person who had their heartbrokn have moved on . So how does one deal with that ? Its different for everyone . Some can get over faster then others . Just try to enjoy life the best way you can . Things will get better 
How did we meet ? Copy this on your stat and see who remembers . 
A politician sees his family everyday ; a deployed soldier once in 6 months . A politician flies 1st class ; a soldier flies in a C130 . A politician's pension is not reduced ; a soldier's is clawed 65% . A politician enjoys an expense account ; a soldier must justify extra rations . A politician ... vows to defend their country ; a soldier actually keeps that promise . REPOST IF YOU SUPPORT OUR TROOPS 
Your love is like a river , peaceful and deep . Your soul is like a secret I never could keep . When I look into you eyes I know that its true . God must Have spent a little more time on you .

DearMr . President , I heard you want to freeze pay rates for soldiers starting next year . Would you also consider cutting your own pay to savemuch more money for our country ? While you're at it , lets cut down congressmen's pay too . If the people who risk their lives don't get an increase in pay , why would ... we continue raising pay for those who take norisks and reap the benefits ? Keep it going if you agree . 
POKE me if you ever had a crush on me ... LIKE this status if you think I am a good friend ... MESSAGE me if you ever wanted to date me ... COMMENT if we ever had good memories ... Now lets see who's brave enough to COPY and PASTE this as their status .

While you scream at your woman , there's a man wishing he could whisper in her ear . While you humiliate , offend , and insult her , there's a man flirting with her and reminding her how beautiful she is . While you hurt her , there's a man wishing he could take her pain away . While you make her cry , there's a man stealing smiles from her . Post this on your wall if you are against domestic abuse or violence
