HAPPY NEW YEARS !!!!!!!!!! \ 
Best of wishes to all of you in this new year ! 

I'm BORED !!! -.- 
hmmm .... what to do ?... maybe I should blow up something ... I'll get started it !! 
So sleepy ..... I think I'll hit the bed now . 
So ..... bored ..... can't .... think ...... of .... anything .... to .... do .... 
Where did I go wrong , I lost a friend Somewhere along in the bitterness And I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life 
She'll make you take your clothes off and go dancing in the rain . She'll make you live her crazy life but she'll take away your pain like a bullet to your brain . 
So They Came Into The Outway , It Was Sunday - What A Black Day , Mouth To Mouth Resus - Citation , Sounding Heartbeats - Intimidations 
WOHOOO !! Long weekend !........ what to do now ....... 
When I wanted sunshine I got rain-And then I saw her face-Now Im a believer 
They say I'm different- They don't understand- But there's a bigger problem - That's much more in demand - You got world hunger - Not enough to eat - So there's really no time - To be trippin ' on me- 
People always told me be careful of what you do - And don't go around breaking young girls ' hearts - And mother always told me be careful of who you love - And be careful of what you do ' cause the lie becomes the truth 
You keep changin ' the rules - While I keep playin ' the game - I can't take it much longer - I think I might go insane - 
Happy Valentines Day !! Spread the love my friends !! 
So bored ...... what to do ?...... 
Give all that's within you - Be my savior - And I'll be your downfall - You be my savior - Only love can save us now - Love save me now 
I don't wanna live , I don't wanna breathe , ' Less I feel you next to me , You take the pain I feel - Comatose 
You've got troubles , well I've got ' em too , There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you , We stick together and we see it through , You've got a friend in me- You've got a friend in me 
I'm feeling weak and weary walking through this world alone Everything you say , every word of it , cuts me to the bone I've got something to say , but now I've got no where to turn It feels like I've been buried underneath all the weight of the world - Changes 
Everybody wants to be a cat , because a cat's the only cat who knows where it's at ; while playin ' jazz you always has a Welcome mat , ' cause everybody digs a swingin ' cat . 
If you feel so empty- So used up , so let down- If you feel so angry- So ripped off so stepped on- You're not the only one- Refusing to back down- You're not the only one- So get up- LET\S START A RIOT !! " 
Happy Mother's Day !!
