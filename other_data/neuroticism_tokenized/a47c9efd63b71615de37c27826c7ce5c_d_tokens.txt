just finished wathcing the season finale of Glee on hulu and he cried at he end ... he's not scared to say it either ! 
Trying to figure out Country Life ... I don't get this crap . 
feels like poop . Ok , not literally , but he's joined the rest of the world who is currently really , really sick . Oh , and he really enjoys typing in third person . 
finally got the music to Glee and he \Won't Stop Believin'\ " that \ " Don't Rain On My Parade\ " was really a great cover . " 
is drivin ' my stepdad's 1963 Chrysler New Yorker til he can get his car smogged for past due registration . It's fun to drive , but uses gas hella fast ! 
still has feathers in his mouth/nose/hair .... in case you were wondering , he went to the SF Pillow Fight .... and he thought it super fun ! 
had a long week of work but now ... on the seventh day ... he shall rest . 
can somebody say laundry day ? 
work , work , work .... but next week ... no more work !!!... well just for the week . 
will be out of the office until Friday , March 12th . So you'll probably get responses a lot faster on Facebook than usual during this time period . 
is leaving for the Happiest Place on Earth tomorrow , but won't actually be there until Wednesday . Either way , he is sooooooooo excited ! It's been too long . 
Zip-a-dee-doo-dah , zip-a-dee-ay . My , oh my what a wonderful day ! Plenty of sunshine heading my way . Zip-a-dee-doo-dah , zip-a-dee-ay !

prawns were ok , but pizza from last night was better ... sorry mom 
so my sister finally watched glee and she loves it ... but now she's going to drop off some job apps 
is beginning to understand why people like music from this decade ..... Ke$ha and Owl City are not that bad 
can't believe that his own father is an ass who doesn't have the decency to treat others(especially his own children ) with the same respect that people have given him in the past . Up yours dad ! 
is home from the party at < PROPMALE>'s . Super fun !!! Had a blast . Oh , and < PROPMALE > Chinn , will you stop grinding into < PROPFEMALE > Rosen ? That was a little ridiculous .... hahahaha . 
nada ... just chillin at home ... que pasa ??? 
always forgets to type in the \write a comment ... \ " box instead of the \ " write something\ " box ..... old habits from the very old version of facebook die hard " 
mmmmm .... soon it will be dinner time , and I will eat my corned beef and cabbage with < PROPFEMALE > Muller , Mom , < PROPFIRST > , and < PROPFIRST > , and then I will sleep , and all will be good . 
finally watched < PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland last night with < PROPFEMALE > Miller and < PROPMALE > Miller . I don't know about the rest of y'all , but I loved it . 
just realised there's an English ( Pirate ) setting for the language on facebook ..... try it out ! 
is going to a really freakin ' early Passover dinner with < PROPFEMALE > Muller later . Note to family : Passover doesn't being until next week , but I stil love matzo ball soup so it's ok . Matzo me-a , matzo you-a , everybody loves-a matzo . 
is relaxing ... one day without work , school , or too much to do ... but later , we's gonna party with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Bochenek !!! 
has to do laundry .... ugh ... I hate laundry , because you have to separate the fabrics and colors , measure the right detergent , make sure you don't put the washer out of balance , add softener in the middle , be careful with the bleach , transfer to the dryer , make sure it's on th right temperature , remove the clothes before they wrinkle , and then fold everything . Kind of tedious and annoying , eh ? 
feels older and older every day . His bones are achin ' and creakin ' and crackin ' and poppin ' . And this is all just before he turns 21 . 
is back again ! Oy , and I'm tired . 
feels that as much as he hates FOX's news shows , he appreciates a gift from them on his birthday ............. GLEEEEEEEEEE !!!!!!!!! 
Um ... wow still recovering from the party , and can't wait for tomorrow !!! 
is recovering from the birthday-ness of myself . Thank you to everyone for there wishes , thoughts , opinions , stories , gifts , cards , drinks , time , and comments !
