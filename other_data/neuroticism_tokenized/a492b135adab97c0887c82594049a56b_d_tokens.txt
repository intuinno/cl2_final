I've dropped into the 7th level of out-of-work-nerd hell today . I did my first edits of Wikipedia pages . 

\You have dragged me down into hell with you and I will no longer do your bidding \"" 
Off to Boston this evening to take < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > to camp in New Hampshire . Any Boston must see's for precocious 12 year old's ? 
Just dropped off the kids at camp in New Hampshire . < PROPFEMALE > and I are pre-teen free for 3 weeks ! Hawaii here we come ! 
Yesterday -- Hiking in Waimea Valley , snorkeling near Sunset Beach , Tshirt from the buddhist Haleiwa Dojo Mission at their O'Bon festival . Today ??? 
Done with Oahu . Had a great time ! Today , back to Los < PROPFEMALE > -- filtering through 500 pictures , getting ready for Siggraph convention next week . 
I have so many typical \postcard\ " pictures from Disneyland that I decided to do something different -- take the most obscure Disneyland/California Adventure pictures possible . I'm surprised none of my SoCal friends guessed . I added a couple of \ " give aways \"." 
My most vivid memory of 9/11 2001 . Work was closed . So < PROPFEMALE > and I went for a walk on the Playa < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > beach . It was so eerie not having any noise come from LAX . Then one lonely Korean Air 747 that was already halfway across the Pacific at the time of the attack glided into LAX . Then silence again . 
< PROPFEMALE>'s science experiment revealed that goldfish are the overwhelming favorite cheeze snack . Which matched their hypothesis that people would in this case prefer the healthier ( or least unhealthy snack ) . 
< PROPFEMALE>'s science experiment determined that 7th grade girls text approximately 50% faster than boys . Why am I not surprised . 
' athz a cowld in ' ithz nothz . sniff , sniff , cough , cough . 
Traveling to Montreal tomorrow , for a week there and in Toronto . < PROPFEMALE > , where's my hat ? No ! Not the one with the ears , and definitely not the one with the propeller . 
Saw Avatar yesterday . Wow !! All my friends that worked on it should be very proud . It was spectacularly beautiful , and I was on the edge of my seat in awe through the whole movie . 
I now have teenagers in the house . < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > are 13 today , and are now on Facebook . Yes , they Friended me . Go figure . Last night we watched hysterically funny toddler videos . < PROPFEMALE > cried when she saw her parents playing with the kids . 
We finally bought a car to replace our 17 year old Mazda Protege . See how well you know us : Was it ( A ) 2002 Acura TL . ( B ) 2006 Scion XB . ( C ) 1964 Corvette . ( D ) 2008 Mazda 6 . ( E ) 2009 PT Cruiser . ( F ) Something Else . 
is in Montreal again . 
Wacky weather in Montreal . < PROPFEMALE > and almost 60F . I feel silly that I packed all my winter gear . 
felt the earthquake . 6.9 in Baja California . It rolled in Los < PROPFEMALE > for about 90 seconds , so we knew it was big . But thankfully far away , and in lightly populated area . 
is visiting family in Mountain View . 
at NAB schmoozing . 
is on the bike again . Hamstring is finally healing after 2 years of trying everything . Consider this a plug for Dr. < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > . 
So not being gainfully employed has really warped my brain . In the last two weeks I've learned the LSL scripting language , programmed a Google appengine , and am starting to program a chatbot with AIML . Hopefully this severe geeking out comes to an end next week with a new job starting up . 
just got a new Droid X phone yesterday . Of course today I'm downloading the Android SDK ( Software Development < PROPFEMALE > ) . I've now gone beyond geekiness .
