Astonished at people's stupidity :/ Don't friend request again and again after you KNOW you have been ignored the rest of the times . 
Sometimes the simplest of ideas are the hardest to comprehend . 
fail . EPIC fail .

Tonight was __ ? __ ... can't find a description good enough O.O 
Excited for summer school ... O.o I never thought I would say that . 
Taking time out to clarify things to a person who is not willing to listen is pointless . How is that not obvious ? 
I never conquered , rarely came . Tomorrow holds such better days . Days when I can still feel alive . When I can't wait to get outside . 
Thinking is not fun . 
Open your mind . Surely it's plain to see : you're not alone . 
We cannot turn back the hands of time . Just let it go and you'll be fine . 
My nephew wants to grow up to be < PROPFIRST > Beiber . What madness ! 
Found a baby lizard . Screamed really loud . Mom came running with a broom . Priceless moments . 
The beauty of grace is that it makes life not fair . 
We all grew up learning the < PROPFEMALE > rule : treat others the way you would like to be treated . Then , why is it so easy for people to turn a blind eye and not stand up for what is right or at least put down what is wrong ? 
SKYPE ! Skype name : aisha_chughtai ... If you wanna talk to me , add me . If you don't then don't add me . It's quite simple :) 
Even though its rough , its nice to straight up know who your true friends are . 
Random girl on the phone : \What kind of female am I ? \ " Meli Smith : \ " A hard to please one\ " ... Epic XD " 
To the stranger who took my chem book the last second of the bid on ebay ... I got another one ... and for cheaper ... What now ? :D

Don't put your trust in walls ' cause walls will only crush you when they fall . 
Having an awesome time with my bestie Neha Haider and lil bro Alizain Syed Haider (: 
Are you listening or are you just hearing ? 
Positive anything is better than negative thinking 
My iTunes is going crazy ... Fireflies is labeled as Heavy Metal XD 
It just takes some time . Little girl you're in the middle of the ride . Everything , everything will be just fine . Everything , everything will be alright . ^_^ 
wonders why trust is so difficult to attain and so easy to shatter 
Dear dumb illness , \ 
I have my < PROPFEMALE > flavored halls ( courtesy of Meli Smith ) , < PROPFEMALE > lemon ricola ( courtesy of < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > ) , zicam , purell , tissue box , chicken noodle soup to-go , and my warm blanket . You will not be able to stop me from studying my darn chemistry . \ 
Love , \ 
< PROPFEMALE >

Don't you hate it when people take things the wrong way ? 
One of these days letters are going to fall from the sky telling us all to go free (:
