Tryna Hit the Studio 2nite 

Working on my song \2nd last chance\ " today - thanking god for letting me be able to do what i do " 
How do You fix a love un-done ? How do even know u fit to love someone ? and when u decide to take that ride , can u drive from the passenger side ? 1 wheel in the middle 4 hands on it - 2 sets of breaks u decide to slam on it - got damn women where the love go ? 
When your love is lost , your whole worlds thrown off- When the one you need dont need you , what do you do when love is lost ? 
Love aint suppose to feel this way , love aint suppose to hurt or cause me pain , Love aint suppose to make me cry , but now im tryna wipe my eyes - Im Hatin Love 
Now im on the grind like some badd breaks- cuz i remember the time i was last place- Im the realist can u feel it - Never have to tell me get up off ya Ass < PROPMALE > 
You call it Hypin Urself up - I call it street dreaming 
Tryna Hit the Studio 2nite - Gotta alot on my mind - Ive been blessed with this voice so immah sing
