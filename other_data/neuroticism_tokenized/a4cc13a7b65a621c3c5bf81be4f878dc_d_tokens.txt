A man that has not loved can not be complete 

True love is like a circle its never ending 
To the world you may be one person but to one person you may be the world - < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > - 
Love is the emblem of enternity ; it confounds all notions of time , effaces all memory of beginning , all fear of an end -Mademe de Stale- 
You know when you are in love when you see the world in her eyes , and her eyes everywhere in the world - < PROPFIRST > Levesque- 
Only passions , great passions , can elevate the soul to great things 
Courage is contagious . When a brave man makes a stand , the spines of others are stiffened 
The strongest evidence of love is sacrifice . 
Man cannot discover new oceans unless he has the courage to lose sight of the shore . 
All the love history knows , is said to be in every < PROPFEMALE > . Yet all that could be found in two , is less than what I feel for you -unkown- 
So many ways to say , I love you , nver enough to say how much-Cameron Rand-
