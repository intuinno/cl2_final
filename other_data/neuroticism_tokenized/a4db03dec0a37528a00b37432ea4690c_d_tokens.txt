Who the fuck is < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > !? -Julien Milcent 
One week until I get to see < PROPFEMALE > Milby and < PROPFEMALE > Wilhelm ! :)

Please put this as your status if you know someone ( or are related to someone ) who has been eaten by dragons . My wish for 2011 is that people will understand that being eaten by dragons is not something to be ashamed of . Dragons are very terrifying and nearly always unstoppable . 93% of people won't copy and paste this . The other 7% sing in the shower . 
Homecoming parade , game and dance ? Pshh more like homework , laundry , cleaning and Sleepy Hollow . 
\If any one of you is without sin 
Put this as your status if someone you knew was killed by Lord Voldemort or any of his followers . As everybody knows , being killed by Avada Kedavra , having your soul sucked out by a dementor , or getting petrified by a basilisk is a truly tragic fate for anyone ; muggle or wizard . 93% of people won't copy and paste this . Will you make this your status to spread awareness of this growing threat ? 
had fun trick or treating for the homeless , but is really glad to finally be back inside ! 
Thank you , Facebook , for bringing us one step closer to openly stalking each other with the the new \see friendship\ " option . Nothing creepy here at all . " 
\I grope everything I'm friends with\ " - < PROPFEMALE > Coffey " 
\And then I found a twenty-buck bill . \"- < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > " 
just spent the last hour going up to random people and asking them to fill out a survey . The good news : she is one step closer to being done with this research project ! Now about that ten < PROPFEMALE > paper ... 
saw < PROPFIRST > Miller , < PROPMALE > Webb , < PROPFEMALE > McCracken and The < PROPFIRST > Seay Band with < PROPFEMALE > Coffey and < PROPFEMALE > Ruser , got cursed out on the way home , drank too much coffee , talked to two people she has been missing like crazy , and even got some homework done . Good Friday night ? Most definitely . :) 
Things that are getting me through today : cookie dough creations with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > this afternoon , Focus later tonight , and knowing that this monster of a research paper/presentation will be done in less than 24 hours . :) Maybe not done well , but done . 
: Everyone's statuses are either about < PROPMALE > Potter , which I have not seen yet , or going home , which I don't get to do until Tuesday night . I think it's time to avoid Facebook for a while . 
Festival of Lights in Chicago this afternoon with < PROPMALE > Bacon and < PROPFEMALE > Garner ! I am so excited ! 
“Everything in Disney movies is an amoeba . They reproduce asexually . Nothing bad ever happens . ” - Cullen Rogers

The end is near ! English final at 1 , then going home and ( finally ) seeing < PROPMALE > Potter with < PROPFEMALE > Milby and < PROPFEMALE > Wilhelm ! Let's just hope that the two hours of sleep I got will last me through the afternoon . :)

Anyone in < PROPMALE > want to < PROPFEMALE > out ? 
\Pie isn't really pie without cool hwip . Everything's better with cool hwip . \ " \

feels that it is her duty to inform everyone in Geiger that the floor in the lounge is currently lava , and that the only safe method of traversing it is via the furniture . This warning is in effect until further notice . Thank you for your cooperation , and hopefully we will not have this problem fixed anytime soon .

Dear Weather , \ 
\ 
Go big or go home . \ 
SNOW DAY TOMORROW !!!!!!!! And it could not have come at a better time . I'm going to have a nice , warm , lazy catch up day while this snowpocalypse/snowmageddon/snownami ensues outside . :) 
So being sick , sleep deprived and nervous doesn't exactly make for the best RA interview , but hopefully there is still some < PROPMALE > . Now , we wait ... for a long time . 
was elected secretary of Circle K , helped to feed 57 starving children for a year , and just found out that she is going on the Washington , D.C. service trip over spring break . A pretty awesome night ? I think so . :) 
Okay , facebook . You have been nothing but a distraction . I have to get this HOI paper done , and you are constantly tempting me . I think it is time that we say our goodbyes . And tell your friend stumbleupon that I don't want to see him tonight , either . 
Wow I'm a < PROPMALE > dumbass . Love , < PROPMALE > Loeffler 
is having a particularly blah Monday . I just want it to be the weekend so I can go home and see < PROPFEMALE > Milby and < PROPFEMALE > Wilhelm ! 
No more whiney statuses . It annoys me when other people complain about their lives on facebook , so I shouldn't do it either . How do you like that , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > ? 
Well , I'm an alternate , which means not a definite no . Yay ? 
is on her way home ! :) 
Great job to everyone in Hairspray ! You guys did awesome tonight ! 
is back from D-CON , tired and not ready to begin week 10 , but had a great weekend . :) Congratulations to < PROPFEMALE > Myers and < PROPFEMALE > Englund on their elections to district secretary and district treasurer ! 
Maci is a thief . damn her . poop . 
Skipping class to work on my history of ideas paper may have been the best choice I've made all week . Who knows , I might even sleep tonight ! :) 
< PROPMALE > Bacon is procrastinating . Let's hope it doesn't turn into procrasturbating ... 
\Spoiler Alert : Jesus dies . \"- Abigail < PROPFIRST > Bucey " 
The book can also be ... a hat . 
is refusing to acknowledge tomorrow as her birthday until noon , when she is done with class and this awful paper is turned in . Then , but not before then , she will be the happiest ( tiredest ? ) birthday girl in the world . 
Thank you everyone for the birthday wishes ! It has been a great day so far . :)
