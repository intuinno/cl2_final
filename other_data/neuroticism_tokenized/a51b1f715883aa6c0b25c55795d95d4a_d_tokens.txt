Please repost if someone you knew was killed by Lord Voldemort or any of his followers . As everybody knows , being killed by a killing curse , having your soul sucked out by a dementor , or getting petrified by a basilisk is a truly tragic fate for anyone ; muggle or wizard . 93% of people won't repost this , for they have already been killed
