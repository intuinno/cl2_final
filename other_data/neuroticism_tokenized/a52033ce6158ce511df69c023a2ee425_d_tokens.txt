I didn't even play soft ball , so why am I so sore ? How can it already be this damn late ? 
I don`t believe in divorce . Murder is the only option\ 
* Papillon*De*Nuit * 
Pop quiz time ! When was the last time i fell asleep while i was still drunk ? \ 
This weather sucks . Hardcore . I hate hate hate snow and ice . Dad apparently sprained his ankle . I had to one up him . Lost control of Kipsie . Flipped her ... on my way to work . Damage looks kinda heavy . I'm kinda shaken up , and other than my shoulder is kinda sore I'm fine . Wish I could say the say for Kipsie . Sadness . 
What the hell time is it anyways ? 
It's the weekend , finally . Got loads to do . New < PROPFEMALE > is coming out . Promised Inxayne Inmembrane I'd play Sacred 2 with him . Hopefully going to play outside with < PROPFEMALE > , so long as the weather stays nice . Sunday , a concert before work . Going with Inxayne Inmembrane , < PROPFIRST > Yoder , and < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Cottrell . Hopefully the weekends stays good . 
Flarging flargers who flarg ! I think my PS3 needs cleaned , it's not wanting to read Blue Rays . ( And obviously I had to buy blue < PROPFIRST > for New < PROPFEMALE > ) Monday flew , wish the rest of the week would . Concert was amazing . Need to get Inxayne Inmembrane som ear plugs before the next one . And I've learned my lesson , I'm too old to headband like a lunatic . Is it Friday morning yet ? 
Love those awkward moments that happen while I'm driving . < PROPFEMALE > and I were play arguing and somehow it winded up with her telling me all about my nonexistent pregancy and how she ( very badly ) wants a baby sister . Good news : < PROPMALE > got a job . Bad news : It's only temporary . Going to try to get the PS3 looked at this weekend . I really want to watch New < PROPFEMALE > . It's no fun when I only get 15 minutes in and it dies . 
Almost bed time for < PROPFEMALE > . < PROPMALE > and I are going to watch < PROPMALE > Zombie's Halloween 2 . I might give New < PROPFEMALE > another try . Keep forgetting about taking the PS3 to get look at . Why does the work week drag and the weekends fly ? 
You know what the best part of working 3rd shift is ? By the time my monday is over , everyone else is just starting out . Time to snuggle up and get some sleep . Is it the weekend yet ? 
Short weeks are supposed to be good , so why does it feel like it's still Monday when I'm about to be going in for Wednesday ? Is it Friday yet ? 
Yay ! < PROPFIRST>'s here ! Dinner's almost done ! It's almost Thursday ! Having a pizza party at work Thursday night when I go in . Yay ! 
< PROPFEMALE>'s in bed . Going to watch New < PROPFEMALE > in a little bit . Uber excited ! I just wish weekends lasted longer 
Awaiting < PROPMALE > to get out the shower , so we can make out way to Toledo . Headliners . Brain Vomit ( aka Metal ) concert . I don't understand the words , but < PROPMALE > loves that stuff . What a way to celebrate our nearly 1 year anniversary . Wow . Has it only been a year ? 
I'm hungry . < PROPMALE > needs to wake up and make me pankcakes or something . 
Uggghhh ... I hate when I miss up my sleep cycle . I slept way to much yesterday and not enough today . It's gotta balance itself out eventually ... right ? Almost time for work ... 
I really really really don't want to go to work anymore . Why can't < PROPMALE > win the lottery ? I need a nap . 
Monday is over ( for me . ) Ready to sleep . Is it Friday yet ? 
I hate it when < PROPFEMALE > is sick . Second day this week she's missing school . Tomorrow is walking with the dinosuars , hopefully she's feeling better by then . I'm ready to crash 
To say something is fool proof means only fools with use it . Then I should right a book called Fool Proof Guide In Social Etiquette . Walking With Dinosuars was pretty decent other than everyone was around apparently were idiotic fools . 
I can think of only one way for this expirence to be any better , < PROPMALE > being here to fight with me over the good pillow . I hate sleeping alone . 
Yay ! For Fridays that aren't quite Fridays yet . I'm ready for the weekend . And this was a slightly short week . Only 8 hours to work and it's my weekend :) 
Blarg . 
People need to understand that children\ 
with special needs don't have an illness so there is no cure & it's\ 
not contagious . They only want what we all want , to be accepted . Most\ 
of you probably won't copy and paste this . Will you do it and leave it\ 
on your status for at least an hour ? It's special Education week and .. \ 
... this is in honor of all the kids who need a little extra help &\ 
understanding . 
< PROPMALE > is practicing his new guitar . Has been on and off all day . This makes me very happy :) 
This summer seems like it's going to be pretty interesting . Lots to do :) 
Sunday May 23rd . Soft ball . At the Maxton Motors park in Butler . ( at least I think that's what it's called ) 2 pm . BBQ/potluck . Anyone interested ? 
is it friday yet ? 
Work ..... ugh ... 
What a busy weekend I've got planned .. 
< PROPFIRST > was sitting on the couch when I woke up . Now he's sitting on my bed playing Assassin's Creed . The only question I have is , why am I awake this early ? I'm still tired ... 
Time for work . Where am I supposed to put Zues ? and why is he barking ? 
toyota financial is really pissing me off . It's like they don't want me to make my payment . A 2 minute thing has taken me well over 15 minutes . 
My wrist is starting to hurt from playing Rock Band 2 . I am out of practice . I wish someone * coughcoughChuckcoughcough * would come play with me . 
Apparently I got some sun today . Rock Band 2 awaits me ... and yet again no one to play with me ... sadness .. 
Hmm ... What do I want to do ? More Rock Band , raid the kitchen , or something else ? Guess I'll figure it out soon enough .. 
Another day of Rock Band ? I think so . 
Rock Band 2 , Bones Season 1 , random book , or raid the kitchen ? I'm really going to have to think on this one ... 
< PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > are here :) Discussing lots of stuff . I'm reading for food . 
< PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > left . < PROPMALE > and I played Rock Band 2 for a while . Now we're going to watch Bones season 1 :) 
My teenage self entertains and amuses me . What am I going to do with all this stuff ? 
sleep .... then tackling more stuff for the garage sale . woo woo woo ! I am almost excited :) 
Moving/Garage Sale !!!! Thursday , Friday , Saturday . Lots of stuff !!!!! Something for everyone !!! 
Slightly false advertisement : Moving/Garage Sale !!!! Everything possible is moving from our possesion to yours but unfortunately the garage is not for sale . This Thursday , Friday , and Saturday . Lots of stuff !!!!!!!!! Something for everyone !!!!!!!! EVERYTHING MUST GO !!!!!! 7956 Cicero road , Hicksville . Be there or be square !!!!!!

All that I'm after is a life full of laughter\ 
As long as I'm laughin'\

I'm thinkin ' that all that still matters is love ever after\ 
After\

' Cause I know there's no life after you 
work .... not looking forward to this ... 
Who is < PROPFIRST > ? And why did I wake up sleepily shouting \They killed < PROPFIRST >!\" to < PROPMALE >?" 
Going to play < PROPMALE > of Persia for a little bit before I have to go to work . Tomorrow is busy . < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Cottrell , < PROPFIRST > Yoder , < PROPFIRST > Robinson and I are going to Lima for a concert . Love as Revenge , Iwrestledabearonce , Otep , and I'm not sure who else . 
time for some sleep ... then getting up and around . Uber excited for Love as Revenge and Otep with < PROPFIRST > Robinson , < PROPFIRST > Yoder , and < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Cottrell . I just wish Inxayne Inmembrane was going as well . Sadness . 
Happy Father's Day :) 
work soon ... no fun with my foot ... 
Back home from Indy ... Mom and Dad's new house is amazing . The drive was decent . Now I'm ready for bed , I've been up waaaay too long . < PROPMALE > thinks I'm losing it . 
What do I want to do today ? 
I'm expirencing much sadness ... I've nearly finished season 2 of Bones ... < PROPMALE > is wearing my shirt ... and I am tired ... 
Out of bed a little later than I wanted , but now we're off to mom's house so < PROPMALE > can fix the computer and I .... I'm not sure what I'm doing .. 
mmmm , time for sleep ... This makes me very happy :) 
got stuff to do and I need < PROPMALE>'s help ... and he won't motivate ... I'm giving him another 5 minutes and then i'm doing it my way and he can deal with it . 
Warning : I can not and will not be held accountable and/ or liable for anything I may or may not have said , done , or implied last night , especially anything involving a southern drawl , no matter how funny and/or realistic and/or Dr. Philish it might have been . With that said , I am going to try to go back to sleep . Gotta be fully rested for Eclipse with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > 
Hmmm ... I am not sure ... Did I like Eclipse ... or didn't I ? 
Hmmm .. spending the night with Taz and < PROPFEMALE > .. what shall I do to entertain myself ? 
Hmmmm .... Why is it so hot in here ? It's night time .. the sun is down ... it's supposed to cool off ... 
is my weekend really over ? feels like I just got off work .. and now I have to go back in already ? 
I'm hungry .. and about to fall asleep .. 
Laundry , shower , sleep , donate blood , buy some stuff , pack my stuff , clean my car , work , shower again , pack the car ..... All of that in roughly 26 hours ... Can I do it ? Let's hope so ... 
just about ready to leave :) yay ! for vacations ! 
We're here . Safe . Pizza is here . No service here for my phone , so don't bother . Tomorrow , bra shopping methinks .. 
Designing my own Nascar Car . This slightly amuses me . Too much loading . 
designing my own car fails .... is it bed time yet ? 
I'm thinking it's time to go to sleep ..... Please , soon ? 
Hell Week for < PROPMALE > Fulmer and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Pelt Fulmer has officially began . With how loud it can get , selective hearing is a must have . 
Hmmm ... I need head phones .. so I can watch Bones on my laptop ... Damn me for losing them .. 
I think I need something better to do than photo editing pictures . I just don't have the motivation to go get my book from the car . And other people's words are more facsinating than my own . 
Hmmm , it's Monday ... what do I want to do today ? 
< PROPMALE > is unhappy , crying and ready to go home . I'm ready to disappear into some episodes of Bones . Then some writing . Then some reading . Then some sleep . Maybe not exactly in that order . 
bed .... yay ! 
Bones . Season 4 . How long until I conquer them all ? 
mmmm , sleep ... cuddly time .. Damnit , < PROPMALE>'s got my pillow .. 
damn .. my laptop battery is about dead .. no more bones for a little while .. at least < PROPMALE>'s awake ... 
I can watch one more episode of Bones and then my laptop will be close to dead ... sleep sometime soon after .. i have a feeling I'm getting up early tomorrow 
Hmmm , only a few minutes left until powering down will begin ... Now I'll annoy everyone by turning a light one and amusing myself with words . Either those of my own creation or that of someone else's imagination .. That is the question ... 
Need to get all my stuff together .. go to sleep .. so we can go back home ... yay ? 
Is this the weekend that will never end ? I'm ready for things to get back to ... wait .. I don't even know what I'm talking about anymore ... 
Soapbox and I have successfully moved all my stuff from < PROPMALE>'s house to my parent's house .. This is very weird .... Being back to square one ... 
1999 polaris 335 4-wheeler ( LOW < PROPMALE > ) snow blade , winch & snow cap $ 2,500 ... Youknow you're interested ... Contact Sindie Martenies 
One more night , one more night , one more night ... ughhh ... I don't want to go in tonight ... 
failing miserable in my quest to communicate with Inxayne Inmembrane 
Mom , < PROPFEMALE > , Will , the boys and I are going to go see Despicable Me ! Sounds like uber amounts of fun ....... New tires tomorrow .... Seeing < PROPMALE > sunday ... 
Ughh .... Why would people want to be awake at this hour ? I'm ready to go back to bed ... 
Burnt ? But I don't go outside .... pretty good day ... could have been better , but could have been a lot worse ... now to watch movies :) 
I'm heading to bed ... Sleep is not over rated with me .... 
Off to work ... Hopefully I'll get to see < PROPFEMALE > and Inxayne Inmembrane tomorrow ... If not It'll at least be closer to the SoCo conert .. ( Next Friday ! ) 
I will not get my hopes up too high . I will just think positive , but expect negative results .. Now ... Dinner .. and later some sleep ... 
I think having things planned out ... 2 more nights of work . Swimming Saturday ... Most likely Monday when I get off work I'll be going to < PROPFEMALE>'s for most if not all of the week ... Mmm ... I'm thinking let's fast forward through tonight .. and go to sleep .... What is it ... 8 more days until the SoCo concert ? Uber excitement :) 
\What else could you need ? You've taken everything ! \ " - Otep " 
< PROPMALE > Turk is the lucky charm of finding random people ... We always seem to run into people we haven't seen in a while .. This is the second encounter with Mr. Haught . 
Seriuosly wishing that my mind was a blank canvas right now rather than the jumbled upon thoughts that are turning me into a clusterfuck moron once again . 
Cookies , peanut butter , Juno , and Soapbox .... this is almost as good as it can get .... 
\If I'm a danger to myself .... Just think what I could do to you ... \ " Otep " 
Roughly 36 hours until the Something Corporate concert with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > We are both uberly excited . 3rd time lucky and maybe I'll get to meet < PROPFIRST > 
If you could be my punk rock < PROPFEMALE > I would be your garage band < PROPMALE > . I wanna feel you breath me . Caught a train to Pughkeepsie and time stood still . I don't care if you die your hair you'll always be a red head bitch . I am a butterfly .......... 22 hours !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Sleepy time ... Early ( for me ) start for the day which is going to be a long but fun one :) yay for Something Corporate and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > 
Hmmm .. What should I wear ? 7 and 1/2 hours !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
ZOMJ ! The Something Corporate concert with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > was more amazing than any words could describe . I wish we were closer and that they would have played Globes & Maps and I won't make you . My throat hurts from screaming . Now off to bed . I am meeting up with < PROPMALE > Turk around 1pm . So we can meet up with < PROPFIRST > Robinson in Ft . Wayne\ 
But if I built you a city , would you let me in ? Would you tear it down ?... 
Still \suffering\ " from post concert and < PROPFIRST > euphoria . " 
I love it when I have amazing weekends :) People like < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > Turk and < PROPFIRST > Robinson helped make my weekend spectacular :) 
\and so i fall\ 
I miss Daddy < PROPFIRST > , My Wife , and My Heartbeat . \ 
\and so i fall \ 
I NEED to talk to either Soapbox or my Heartbeat . \ 
\Am I blurry\ 
\Tell me I'm frozen\ 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > is making me pom poms to wear in my hair to work . 2 more nights of work and then the weekend :) \ 
\ 
\If I’m a danger to myself\ 
< PROPMALE > Turk and I are going to go visit with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Cottrell \ 
Uber awesomeness :) 
Soapy is asleep .. and I'm wide awake .. Sleeping at night is too difficult for me to pull off anymore ... 
Bedtime soonish . < PROPFIRST > Robinson and < PROPMALE > Turk sometime after I wake up . \ 
\But as you sleep 
Is it the weekend yet ? Work is trying to drive me insane . Come home the dogs are trying to drive me insane . Gah , what am I doing this weekend anyways ? 
Ughhhh , if it's the weekend why am I feeling more stressed than during the week ? 
Off to get the wife from work :) Maybe he'll cook for me tonight for a change :) 
I don't think that I like being awake this early .. But the zoo is worth it :) 
Wow ! This is way to early for me . I am doubting I'm going to be taking that nap in Kipsie . Off to < PROPFEMALE > we go :) 
I am uberly tired . Is it bed time yet ? 
Washer done and clothes ready to be switched over . Just about time to sleep . How much this excites me almost scares me . 
Was soll ich heute tun ? Ideen ? 
Got a hot date with me wife , my heartbeat , and cheesecurds . This makes me uberly happy :) Guess everyone will now know how to find me . 
Mmmmmm ... Sleep ..... < PROPFIRST > Robinson and < PROPMALE > Turk time is later :) 
Mmmm ... sleep ... < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > will be over later .. and probably < PROPMALE > Turk 
I think ...... it's time ... to start writing again .... I just have to remember how to think ... maybe I should start reading the dictionary rather than the same books over and over . 
I just sneezed . That means it is time to go . 
A quick nap ..... 
Time to get some sleep .. and then I've got a hot date with the wife ... Not really sure what we're going to do but something fun :) 
hmmm .. food .. what sounds good ..? 
The Sobe contest is not worth the effort . An epic fail . They should send me cookies for wasting my time . 
Amazing Birthday Wishes Conversation :\ 
Go Headbutt a Bullet says : today is < PROPMALE>'s birthday ... haha\ 
? says:what's a < PROPMALE > ? \ 
Go Headbutt a Bullet says : stupid ? \ 
Go Headbutt a Bullet says : spencer\ 
? says : spiffy ? \

? says : oh shit .. did i say that ? 
Taz and I are going to cuddle down and get some shut eye .... mmmmmmm .. I like this plan 
Maybe when I'm done with endings this can begin \ 
Punk Rock princess : something corporate 
Awesome night . < PROPMALE > , Soapbox , and < PROPFEMALE > with a little bit of < PROPFIRST > time . I put in 2g plugs . And now I'm thinking I need to discover how well the service is in my room . 
This is going to be interesting . 
\But the driveway's clear\ 
Sleep ... Lovely :) 
Yow-za ! 
Do any of us really know everybody on our Facebook friend list ? Here's a task for you . I want all my FB friends to comment on this status about how you met me . After you comment , copy this to your status ... so I can do the same to you . You will be amazed at the results you get in 12 hours ! 
What the hell am I doing up still ? Taz is already in bed and waiting for me ... Grrr .. Sleep is needed :) 
I have found new Cauterize .. This creates intense amounts of pleasure in my ear cavities :) 
Lets\ 
see how forth coming my Facebook friends are . Leave a 1 word comment \ 
that you think best describes me using the THIRD letter of YOUR first \ 
name . No repeats . It can only be 1 word . Then copy and paste this post \ 
on your wall , so I can leave a word about you :) :) :) 
Wow . Taz and I have so much more in common than I thought . We both fall out of big beds . Time to get around . Yay for fun days ! 
There is still a vague hint of yellow on my face , but my paleness has absorbed the black . 
Last night will forever be on my mind . Let's hope today can be another one of those kind :) \ 
me : FAIRVIEW ! \ 
Soapbox : HILLTOP ! \ 
random kid : this is the Hicksville vs . < PROPMALE > Trace game . \ 
Soapbox and I : Did we show up at the wrong game ? 
I love weekends like this . The ones where every single things repeats in your head . Tonight is going to be so much better in my head than in reality 
gftr54 vb b hyg y66gty hbbbbbbyy667y6 y tty\ 
12 hours at work ... Home .. Why am I not sleeping ? ZEUS ! SHUT UP ! 
I like it where ever , generally in the kitchen , but I have a tendency to move locations a lot . 
Sleepy time with Taz ... Followed by an interesting day with someone :) \ 
If you would trust me with your heart I would never miss a beat :) 
I'm liking it pretty much anywhere , now if I could only find it :) 
Sister < PROPFEMALE > A Tasty Mistress Lady Day !!!! \ 
Sleepy time first :) 
You and I wake up in jail together . Using ONLY four words , what would you say to me ? ( Note : If you comment , you have to copy and paste this into your status . Be fair , play along) ? 
Weekends go by too fast , week days take forever to finish . \ 
\What started out as < PROPFEMALE > turned into a lover's tryst\ 
Having a bad day ? Frustrated with someone ? Have a sucky job ? Wanna punch a bitch in the face ? Annoyed with converstions ? \ 
The answer to make all of this go away is : cookies\ 
I'm pretty sure that I need more . 
Like this and I'll say : 1 . Something I've learned about you by looking \ 
at your wall for 13 seconds . 2 . The color you remind me of . 3 . My first \ 
memory of you . 4 . The animal you remindme of . 5 . Ask something I've \ 
always wondered about you . 6 . My favoritethingabout you . 7 . Give you a \ 
weird nickname . 8 . Challenge you to post this . I will answer everything 
Sister < PROPFEMALE > A Tasty Mistress Lady Day !!!! YAY :) \ 
Sleep now\ 
\Catch you when you fall from grace \ 
mmmm sleepy time :) \ 
\My heart starts reacting\ 
I'm a banana . < PROPFIRST > is a gorilla . \ 
We go to together like pb&j\ 
Like grandma and prandpa\ 
Like youtube and videos\ 
Like < PROPFEMALE > and drama 
Sister < PROPFEMALE > A Tasty Mistress Lady Day :) \ 
\ 
\There's nothing that I can do to make you want me like I need you to . \ 
I think < PROPFEMALE > Husted just might hate me . \ 
Let the waxing begin . \ 
* Shudders * 
The best part about mornings ? Time to go to sleep :) 
The night is my companion . solitude my guide . 
Hmmm . Bed time ? Then laundry and cleaning ? \ 
I gotta make sure you don¿t forget me :) \ 
Tango dancing < PROPFEMALE > cat . That is all :) \ 
I break in two over you . \ 
And only you can give the breath of life . \ 
But you don¿t see me . \ 
And torch the part of me that is you . \ 
Hopefully tonight goes by fast . Is it friday yet ? \ 
Now the story's played out like this . \ 
Just like a paper back novel . \ 
Let's rewrite an ending that fits . \ 
Instead of a hollywood horror . \ 
I dedicate this update to < PROPFIRST > . Ya know , i once knew a guy named < PROPFIRST > . His name was < PROPFIRST > . \ 
' cause i find myself in you\ 
i love my booboo <3 
Sleepy time , me thinks ? \ 
i don't wanna feel this small \ 
you know i just can't handle this \ 
handle this at all \ 
and so i'll fall \ 
i'll let my heartbeat drop \ 
i falter as the music stops \ 
and you watch me as stall \ 
and wonder when i ........ 
Hostile . Part 2\ 
You gave me roses and i left them there to die . \ 
The rest is too long to say but my ending thoughts are : Sing until the song sings you . \ 
Tomorrow's just another word to describe being alone\ 
My thoughts create my world . \ 
Now if only i could get all my thoughts processed and managed . \ 
SERENITY FUCKING NOW\ 
I wanna < PROPFEMALE > onto something that won't break away or fall apart like the pieces of my heart\ 
The best part about morning time ? \ 
Going to bed\ 
You said I always sang too loud to sing you a love song . \ 
Well I save my soft voice for the things I really mean . \ 
You always said I had a hard time saying what's on my mind . \ 
Well , here it goes : I hate you for what you've done to me . 
Like a bad < PROPFEMALE > , i'm falling down to you . She's the only one who knows what it is to burn . \ 
I wait in fearful silence . \ 
Turn my back to you . \ 
Wordlessly telling you how long i want this to last . \ 
Tear me open at the seems . \ 
Take everything you need\ 
Take my heart if you like the beat . \ 
Take my lungs if it's hard to breathe\ 
This is not the best way to figure out out long your hair is : proceed to pull out sample pieces from different locations on your head , tape them down to a table with your handy dandy tape gun , and then use your work tool to measure the length .... 
< PROPFEMALE > has flipped her lid . At least it's amusing me though :) \ 
I want to save you . \ 
I need you to save me too . \ 
I'm giving up on love cause love's givin up on me\

I think ... I blogged on myspace A LOT 
I wake up to find it's another\ 
Four aspirin morning , and I dive in\ 
I put on the same clothes I wore yesterday . \ 
When did society decide that we had to change\ 
And wash a tee shirt after every individual use :\ 
If it's not dirty , I'm gonna wear it . \ 
...... \ 
My life has become a boring pop song\ 
And everyone's singing along . 
Random*Meaningless*Pieces*of*Nothing says :\ 
i would break into your house to liberate your books in the attic\ 
Embers says :\

they want to be liberated . they want to be smelled . they want to be loved . they want to be read 
Get to church cause your a good girl\ 
and i never told you that\ 
whatch me smack that ..... ouhhh gimme some more .. smachk that .. gimmme some more ... woooah .. :) 
Goodnight Moon\ 
Goodnight yellow balloon\ 
I don't know how this goes ... But the message is still the same : sleepy time :) 
The night is still young , what kind of trouble am i going to stumble upon next ? \ 
If this works it's going to be instahappiness to the power of infinity ... 
so ... instahappiness to the power of infinity was rerouted to a new < PROPFEMALE > . A fail , a win , almost bed time .. yay ! 
< PROPFEMALE > came over . I am not sure if i'm letting her come back anymore . I hurt all over . \ 
I disconnect my head my heart :) \ 
I do not enjoy school buses and seeing herds of deer in the morning . They fail . \ 
Siriusly need to figure out how to stop hurting myself . Cardboard cut last night . Burnt myself tonight . Ugh\ 
Just one more night ... Hmmm ... What torture will < PROPFIRST > find for me tonight 
If i'm a danger to myself just think of what i could do to you :) \ 
My life has become a boring pop song and everyone is singing along\ 
Happy thanksgiving :) \ 
I wish I could break you into a million pieces and put you back together in a way you want me just as much as i do you . \ 
* Growls*\ 
You don't want to know my thoughts . 
Nom nom nom hat has been liberated from the land of the lost :) \ 
Hours pass and i still count the minutes that you aren't here . \ 
Work amusement . Staple gun is not a hammer :) \ 
Does history guide you or do you set out to change it ? \ 
Woot for it being friday , not tuesday . Yay for Staciland . Applause for everyone who knows what i'm talking about :) :) :) \ 
When filling out your Christmas cards this year , take ONE CARD and SEND it to this address : A Recovering American Soldier , c/o < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Army Medical Center , 6900 < PROPFEMALE > Avenue , NW Washington , DC 20307-5001 . If we pass this on and everyone sends one card , think of how many cards these soldiers could get to bring up their spirits . Please re-post A great idea . 
Heavy sigh . Oh nostalgia . \ 
Taz and Zeus .. My cuddle buddies ... that smell kinda funny .. most of the time ... 
Sadness . I am going through < PROPFEMALE > withdrawl :( \ 
Life was so exciting at 14 ! Every sentence ! Even if it wasn't a sentence ! Had ! To ! End ! With ! An ! Exclamation mark ! \ 
Once upon a time there was a girl who wanted to live in alaska when she got older . The cold didn't bother her . Where did that girl go ? \ 
I've been afraid of changing because i've built my life around you\ 
My tongue is a vivid shade of pink and i keep examining it . Yay :) for being easily amused\ 
Don't have a hammer ? Just use random objects :) \ 
And just remember ... You're the one thing that i can`t get enough of :) \ 
( 1/2 ) So what would you say to me\

I'm glad you're ok with this\ 
damaging awkwardness .

Come on sweet catastrophe :) \ 
Kittykins is here :) That means breakfast .. 
Sleeeeeeeeeeeeeep !!!!!!!!!!! Wooooo for not having work for the rest of the year :) 
Making dinner for my loves : < PROPFEMALE > and soapbox . \ 
I feel like my heart is racing its way to towards becoming a moth of ecstasy in the form of peanutbutter pie\ 
Why must the water container be empty ? I need drink of the water variety . And bathroom break !! Yay\ 
What was I thinkin' ? \ 
Oh , I knew there'd be hell to pay . \ 
But that crossed my mind a little too late . \ 
An ' I was thinkin ' ' bout a long kiss , \ 
Man , just gotta get goin ' , where the night might lead . \ 
I know what I was feelin ' , \ 
But what was I thinkin' ? \

Screw taste the rainbow , make it wear the rainbow .... I want my rainbow back ! 
There goes my sleep schedule ... I think I need to motivate . Presents to ( finish ) wrapping . Laundry to do . Dinner at 5 ... ( Is it bed time yet ? )

Cuda and < PROPMALE > are napping .. Does this mean i get to join them ? 
Oh no ! Everthing is ruined ! I forgot to get the twinkies . \ 
Chill out everyone ! Any and all screams of pain from Staciland is just < PROPFEMALE > torturing me . Bring on the wax\

Left for the the casino with only 18 dollars . Gave a dollar to < PROPFEMALE > . Left with 16 dollars and 75 cents . Not too bad for my first time :) \

Sindie Martenies ( aka mom ) just made me a cup of hot cocoa ...

Abuse me maybe tie me to the bed post\ 
And leave for a few days\ 
Tell me you love me\

That it has to feel good when you stop\ 
Show me all don't you hide\ 
Tell me all your secrets\

When you can live forever , what do you live for ? \ 
Time to do whatever form of torture < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > can come up with for the day . 
Maybe when I'm done with thinking , \ 
Maybe you can think me whole . \ 
Maybe when I'm done with endings\ 
This can begin , this can begin\
