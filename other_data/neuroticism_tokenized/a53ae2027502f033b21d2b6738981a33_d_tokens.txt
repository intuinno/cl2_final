\I have found a < PROPFEMALE > within myself that no experience in this world can\ 

Someone broke into the house across the street from me . The police were looking through our trash . < PROPFIRST > and I are playing detective . Its kind of fun . I feel bad for the lady though . 
Happy Guy Fawkes Day ! 
Yay for weddings ... and awkward social situations ... and cleaning up after them . ^_^

Sometimes I wish people would stop spending their time judging others and start worrying about making themselves a better person . ~_~ 
I don't want to set the world on fire . I just want to start a flame in your heart . ~ The Ink Spots from Fallout 3 
Yay for ramen and < PROPMALE > Potter marathons ! ^_^ 
I think that if I didn't have social anxiety/phobia , I could be a really powerful person and rule the world . I think God gave me that flaw just to prevent it from happening . Just a thought . LOL ^_^ 
I really want to cry , rant , whine , and complain on here today , but I decided to be nice and save everyone the drama because life already has too much drama . ^_^ 
Happy Lunar New Year ! Good Luck to all the Rabbits ! ^_^
