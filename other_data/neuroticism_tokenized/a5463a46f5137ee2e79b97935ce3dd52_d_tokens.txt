Well , I'm slowly getting used to facebook 

Is determined to become a better violinist 
So is it weird that I want to add my teachers on face book ? I think it is , but I still want to do it ! lol 
bahahaha ! that bitch could sing , but she looked like she just shit her pants ! Great night . 
Alright , so it's time for school T_T And I'm dressed pretty trashy today . But whatever . I don't even want to go ... but it's the \law\ " lol . " 
Don't I feel like a loser . >.< no messages on the space or the book . lol I suck at life 
I officially Hate the super bowl and rednecks ! 
Gonna chop all my hair off . xD Tomorrow after school . Kind of excited I guess ? 
uuuuuuugh ! He makes me so mad ! >:( 
We did amazing . I'm going to miss the cast , the set and everything . T_T 
Lol , I wish I had a camera so I could have a \west side story\ " album . " 
HA , so I'm definantly still mad . and he doesnt even know why ! Or care , whichever one I honestly don't give a fuck anymore 
Goodnight World . Tomorrow ... you better be amazing . Don't make me punch you in the teeth . Thanks ! ~ Night 
So I'm feeling really left out and replaced . >.< And I'm probably being stupid , I know ... but still 
Is craving the beach right now . T_T 
Guess Who got a car ! 
Never Felt better . In other words : pretty fan-fucking-tastic ! 
spontanious hair dying ... probably a dumb thing to do 
Accepted into the summer arts program ! And I'm very excited about it . 
Still tired , sore , and cold . And can't quite figure out why . 
So I've decided : In an attempt to sharpen my artistic style and abilities , I'm going to take on the Gaga masterpiece . Which , if I haven't told you already , is lady gaga , ruthlessly and viciously beating a homeless man with a prostetic leg . Questions ? Comments ? Concerns ? 
Bahahahahah ! my Little brother \Troy ... Is it actually night ? \ " \ " yeah wade ... You would know that if you stopped playing lego batman and looked out that window ... it's right there . \ " His response ? \ " eh . \"" 
Dear Wendsday , I hate you . Which is weird because you're normally my favorite day of the week . I dislike today . But there were a few things that made me happy . :3 
4*16*2010 ! 
I have people . \People judge me so bad because of my voice . \ " Judge you ?! because you have the \ " retard accent\ " what about what you said about me you dumb fuck ?! " 
For some reason this song makes me really sad ... I can't figure it out . But I love it . For several reasons . 
it's officially been WAY to long since I've seen my best friend . 
Tomorrow ! Join me in the National Day of Silence , please . 
So my day of silence went from 12am- 5:30 pm . I wanted it to last longer , but I fucked it up . 
Is it bad that I'm starting to dislike listening to music unless it's on the radio ? Because I realize how much my music tastes have changed , and by association how much I , myself , have changed . It's not bad . Just kind of odd . 
So I'm going to start work on these pictures . The gaga masterpiece and another one . Both of which I want to be proud of . So I'm going to dedicate myself to completing them and making them somthing worth showing off . 
Got Handle-Halvorsen Pasacaglia today ! St < PROPMALE > ing my < PROPMALE > project , one of them at least . I'm very excited ! 
Soooo , \Animal Rubber bands\ " are apparently the new pokemon cards . Ouch . " 
I'm not sure how I feel about this ... 
Is feeling pretty replaced . 
Why do you seem to take pleasure in ruining my fucking day ? I can't stand to be around you most of the time , and somehow that's MY fault . It's MY fault that you're a bitch . Please just leave me alone ... 
Is tired . 
I despise cutting grass .... 
Guess who's a licensed driver ! 
I aboslutly adore how completely fake you are . 
So . I've made up my mind . As soon as it's possible I'm 1 . ) dedicating myself to being amazing at something 2 . ) learning to dance 3 . ) getting my lip pierced 4 . ) getting a job 5 . ) moving out 6 . ) getting into shapeeeee . I'm determined ! 
So . just fyi , facebook . This whole checklist of things I want to get done is moving very slowly . But it is being worked on . xD 
Mash up time ! \ 
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars ? I could really use a wish right now . I know that after tonight , you won't have to look up at the stars no no no no . If I lay here . Will you lie with me and just forget the world ? 
So for some reason , unbeknowst to me , I feel the need to put something deep and heartfelt for my status . But I'm not going to . \ 
Pilifalano . 
Oh < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > . You know how to take a simple conversation and turn it into an argument . You rude bitch . 
Lady Gaga's < PROPMALE > has the stranges video I think I've ever seen . Kudos Lady Gaga . Kudos for showing the entire viewing public that nuns can be kinky and that you definantly DONT have a penis . 
And so begins my two week adventure ! Costal < PROPFEMALE > summer arts academy , here I come ! :D 
Ugh ! It's been two days and I already miss it . T_T my last year at the CCU summer arts academy is now over . It makes me sad ! >.< but I learned a lot and made a lot of new friends . Still waiting on that sleepover ! 
I believe it's almost time for a haircut again . 
Job interview tomorrow at 10:30 in the AM ! :) 
Omg . Mother please leave me alone . Just for once . LEAVE ME ALONE 
lol just one question . Why are you such an argumentative BITCH ? you're picking a fight about a damn lighter . that YOU lost ? really , bitch ? 
Happy fourth . xD Fireworks for days at my house . and food for longer . 
Fireworks = Bursts of light making love to the night sky = amazing . so ; a = b = c or something like that . 
So apparently fate does not want me to buy a Ke$ha ticket . Well fate , have at you ! I'm getting my ticket ! 
\Don't ever wash edible panties in the washing machine ... they melt . \ " ~ < PROPFEMALE > Goodwin " 
\What about butterflies in your vagina ... that's cute right ? \ " ~ < PROPFEMALE > Goodwin " 
Oh Ke$ha . You though you were going to get away with NOT selling me a ticket . But I got it ! and now when I'm at your concert , you'll look at me in the audience and think \Oh shit ! \ " xD " 
\We used to eat cheese out of a can every night for dinner ! \ " ~ < PROPFEMALE > Goodwin " 
\I don't keep bugs in my vagina ! there's only sunshine in there ! \ " ~ < PROPFEMALE > Goodwin " 
\I feel so sexy after african dance ! \ " ~ < PROPFEMALE > Goodwin " 
\On my own . Pretending he's not married ! \ " ~ < PROPFEMALE > Goodwin " 
My little brother squirted me in the eye with a watergun full of pool water ! OW ! 
Alright Dairy < PROPFEMALE > . Let's stop playing hard to get now . Just hire me already so we can both be happy ! 
Facebook , what do you call someone who can use a spanish web ? 
\Why do you talk like that ? and walk like that ? It has to take some effort to keep that up . No one wants to see a MAN flouncing around like a < PROPFEMALE > . I don't care if you're gay . I just don't want you to be a flammer . \ " ~ Krystal < PROPFIRST > " 
So . I definantly had a dream that I went to costal , but it was all zombie filled and scary . And Mr. Layton totally protected me from zombies and giant spiders . 
I'm just a boy with big ideas . My objective is not to offend , but merely offer a new , true perspective and ultimatly create change . Good people is a dying breed . I think we can revive it . 
So I've decided . I want a cow pillow pet ... Is that bad ? 
I feel like , if I would have been born pretty I would have grown up to be a < PROPMALE > . >.< 
So ... Since I'm a big nerd . And a dork with nothing better to do . I'm going to make the < PROPFEMALE > II out of legos . >.< Wish me luck . Pictures ? 
Why am I on so late ? I'm LURKING . What's your excuse ? >:( 
Think of me is proving to be more difficult to learn by ear than I expected . >.< 
LOL ! Thank you facebook . Thank you for informing that many kids who like to sleep also enjoy skittles . xDD It made me smile . 
Wonderful adventures at the pool with < PROPFEMALE > Goodwin ! Getting eye mollested by lifeguards and african water dancing . :) 
The Phantom is calling to me . >.< I neeeeeed to watch it . xD 
August 22 , 7PM here I come ! You're gonna love me ! * enter determined face here * 
I'll pretend that everything is okay , if that makes you happy . Only it won't make you happy . Because you won't be truly happy unless I'm miserable ... Thanks . I love you too . 
So I decided today . I'm going to start writing positive messages on dollar bills . Because I know if I had a dollar for my thoughts , it might cheer me up when I need it . 
Enie meani miney ... go fuck yourself . 
African Dance with < PROPFEMALE > Goodwin tomorrow . So excited . :D 
The dirt is still under my fingernails . It hurts more than you'd think . 
:) Just African danced my ass off . Thank you Christoph Buchegger for teaching me such magical dance skills ! xD 
Glitter rain = the best experience anyone will ever have . ever . 
Fun times with < PROPFEMALE > Goodwin tonight . :D 
When life gives you lemons you make lemonaid . Then you pour that shit in life's eyes so it will cry as much as you . Thanks for your concern , Life . I'm fantastic . :) 
Oh facebook . Something about you makes me want to spill my guts . >.< 
Stir Crazy ! >.< I need to get out for a while . 
So I'm convinced my senior pictures are going to be ugly . >.< I think I'll cry when they come in the mail . 
:( 
Confidence is key . If I can fake that ... I'm in ! :D 
Only three days in school and I'm already over it . I like all of my classes except for spanish . Worst ninety minutes of my LIFE ! T_T 
Into the woods . I've been cast at TOR . there's a first time for everything . Not exactly what I was hoping for , but I'm more than happy to do it 
I feel like I'm losing my drive . And it kills me 
Las metas son a veces difíciles de conseguir , pero voy a trabajar duro y conseguir lo que quiero . 
< PROPFIRST > wants this job ! :D 
I'm pretty positive I'm going to chop all my hair off 
Well . My library books are overdue . So the plans for today are : 1 . Go to the library and return them . 2 . find something else to do for a while 3 . Go and see Nine tonight . :) 
Preparing for magical adventures with < PROPFEMALE > Gaghum . :D I'm excited 
I need a change . Something big . Something great . Something life changing . 
Today is going to be a loooooooooooong day . I'm already ready to skip school and stay home . >.< \ 
And another thing : Why is it that everyone in my school is friends with everyone else in my school ? It seems like everyone from conway highschool has 100+ friends in common with me . And you know half of them hate each other . Just some food for thought . 
Lol my mom is so sweet in the morning . Not really . She's kind of a cunt . 
County Council meeting + Smores + Plans after ? = Good night ? 
So , apparently I've been signed up for african dance classes and was just informed today . Thanks Mrs. Mubarak :D 
Tomorrow looks promising . Let's not fuck it up . :D 
I just did my homework over text message . I'm slack . >.< 
So . I'm not going to lie . I feel like I'm biting off more than I can chew . Three shows . Two AP classes . All county . Student council . A job . \ 
But I'm going to chew the fuck out of it ! 
So ... Seeing as i have teachers on my facebook , is it un-classy to use foul language on my status and such ? 
After a long day of TRYING to find shoes that will fit and are affordable . I've realized that it's impossible . I either have to spend 107$ on two pairs of shoes or spend 60$ on the ugliest shoes I've ever seen in my life . 
Had a wonderful afternoon with < PROPFEMALE > Goodwin and < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > at their BIRTHDAY PARTY ! :D 
I'm very excited for the next couple of months . :D 
I'm feeling inspired , and renewed . But now my only problem is what to do with all this new found inspiration and drive . 
And with his new found inspiration and creative spark , he proclaimed : \I'm going to write a play ! When and about what .. I have no idea . But it will happen ! \"" 
My new shoes are sexier than sexyness ! 
Best sleep over with < PROPFEMALE > Rivas , Jonquil < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > Lopes , < PROPFEMALE > E . Meyerand , and < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > . Well at least four of us had fun . :D 
off to rehearsal in just a few 
Why does my mother insist on ruining everything good . 
A few small notes on my day today : < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > rehearsal went well . Into the woods sponser night was pretty beast ! ( We open tomorrow ! ) . I'm tired , hungry , have homework to do . \ 
And dear < PROPMALE > , I hope you have amazing adventures in Spartenburge , and I hope your endeavors pan out and you make a boatload ! Be safe , K'nuckies , and have a great vacation from South < PROPFEMALE > Suck-fest . 
Opening night has been postponed until Friday . Best wishes to < PROPFEMALE > in the hospital , and < PROPFEMALE > frantically learning her part . 
Into the woods opening in T minus 43 minutes !!!!! 
Dear school system , let me just say you SUCK . 86 dollars for my cap and gown , which I need to graduate . 60 dollars to take the ACT , 80 dollars to take the SAT , 45 dollars to APPLY to a college . 100 dollars to enroll in a college . so far that 451 dollars ! The fines just keep coming ! 
Just had a very vivid daydream . And let's just say I'm ready to get out . >.< 
Homework hell night begins now . I don't foresee any sleep in the near future . Thank you procrastination and INSANE rehearsal schedules for stealing sleep from me yet again . You know I love you for it . Sources say , I should be working ... not facebooking . but this is going to be unbearable without facebook . 
\Where's the goose ? I'm hungry ! \ " ~ < PROPFEMALE > Lopes " 
Dear halloween , \ 
I was happy to see you come , and sad to see you go . And as I watched the man at Ihop tear down all your festive decorations I was sad , sad for the end of an amazing night , and an amazing show . Good job , cast and crew of Into the woods . I hope to see you all again soon . 
and my perfect horizon begins to crumble . Geez , Post show depression , you couldn't come back at a more convenient time ? Same to you , bad decisions and general dumbass-ness . \ 
fml 
I hugged < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ! ( creater and founder of \post secret\ " ) If you don't know what it is please look it up ! " 
I have just decided that I'm going to craft an audition collection . Monologues , sheet music , tracks and soundtracks . * Is determined * 
Just bombed my all county auditions . Fuck my life . Now I'm going to rehearsal . Hopefully this will be a productive day . 
Dear The Rock church , \ 
You have horrible representatives , well , representative . I found him to be very rude , childish , out of line and totally uncalled for . I would recommend finding a new one . 
So , just a recap of my shitty week thus far ... all two days of it . No all county , no job , no money , no gas , no time , no < PROPFEMALE > , no ... nothing . 
Good luck to the cast of < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > tonight . We're going to be amazing . Heres hoping for a full house at some point . 
You have one more day to prove you love me and come see the diary of < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > tomorrow at 3:00 PM at Conway high school . Tickets are 5$ for students , and 8$ for adults . Come see itt ! 
Goodmorning world and all who inhabit it ! I say hello and wish you a wonderful day . 
You know what sounds wonderful right now ... an extra few days on this weekend . 
Wow . just fucking wow 
Alright , can we just get a little something straight ? First off , my sexuality is none of your damn business . It does not apply to you in any way , so I would appreciate it if you would keep your opinions about it to yourself . also , my future is mine and mine alone . If I want to grow up and dig a ditch , why does everyone have to tell me what a big mistake that is ? Let me make my own damn mistakes , that's how you learn . 
Does it count as stalking if it's unintentional ? >.< 
So facebook , you're lucky . You're the first to hear the big news . I've made up my mind ! I have a plan and am determined to make it happen . Big apple . I'm comin ' ... eventually . 
Oh winter . Welcome back , I've missed you 
Oh my god . it's so much harder to tell who is who seeing as everyone has decided to jump on the retarded \Cartoons for default pictures\ " bandwagon . >.<" 
I don't think I can express how upset I am . You won't be here for my eighteenth birthday . My high school graduation , my college graduation , my ... anything . I'm going to miss you , booface . A whole fucking lot . 
Another application , another opportunity . < PROPFIRST > needs a job . BAD 
Ahhh . Just sent my essay to the letters about literature competition . Wish me luck :D 
Oh facebook , let me tell you a secret . It's 10:47 PM going on 3AM and I'm probably not going to be able to sleep . it's feeling like one of those nights . You know , where you toss and turn hopelessly and never get any real sleep because you're too busy thinking about too much other shit . So I'm thinking , Facebook . You should entertain me . Please ? 
So , If anyone wants to tell me how to convert youtube videos into MP3 files they would be my best friend forever . 
Dear itunes/ frostwire . I really dislike you right now . 
Dear Waffle House , please employ me . Thank you 
So , I saw this spam status and thought it was interesting . So , I'm posting it . \ 
\it's\ 
I've just decided that I'm auditioning for dirty rotten scoundrels . 
SO ! If anyone wants to find me the accompaniment track for \The kite\ " From You're a good man < PROPFIRST > brown I would be forever grateful . Help me ? D: " 
602 : we're not so close you and I , and for the first while I knew you you kind of got on my nerves . But I've come to realize you're not so bad and I think we could be moderate friends . :D 
76 : I'm sorry we didn't get as close as we could have during camp . But , from the little bit I DID talk to you , I like you a lot :D And you're very talented . Also , you saw me hug < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . Nuff said 
637 : I knew from the moment I met you we would be friends . I also knew a few other things . But that's not important . What's important is we DID become friends , and I'm forever grateful for it . 
22 : I don't understand why you insist on spending money on me . D: 
46 : I'm really upset that we're not standmates at all county , I'm also really sad about into the woods . D: But , despite the fact that I'm a bitch to you I love your whole face . 
1813 : We need to < PROPFEMALE > out very soon . D: and you text a lot . But I love you and you're an amazing person ! :DD 
0315 : You are indeed the trash master , and I love you for and inspite of it . I miss us eye mollesting wanna be Italian boys in sampson's class . I miss us making up crazy trash stories and starting rumors about ourselfs . I miss your face ! D: 
So I finally got technology under my grasp . iTunes is fixed . as is realtime . Learning my audition song , finding new ones , getting my coastal audition ready , as well as my TOR one . :D I'm very excited . 
766 : oooooooh , fun and awkward times . Awkwawrd due to the lack of knowledge from one of us to the other . and fun because it was fun . :D You're a whore , but that's fine by me . :D And given the < PROPMALE > , we could have been pretty amazing frineds ! 
07 : Oh how I miss you , sweet tart . I miss your ugly purple dress and your trashy hair and makeup . I miss playing tag backstage and making the other girls look trashy . I miss our trashy \Girls room\ " gossip . And I miss your lovely face at my school ! D: when the hell are you coming to visit me ?! " 
99.99 : < PROPFEMALE > día , < PROPFEMALE > muchacho conoció a < PROPFEMALE > a muchacha . y se hicieron grandes amigos mediante drama clase . Y cuando drama < PROPFEMALE > el muchacho fue muy triste que no podía compartir español historias con su amigo ! 
567 : I love your whole face , and you make my whole day . I also don't understand your compulsion to spend money on me , buuuuut I enjoy your company either way . And our waffle house/ TOR adventures are amazing 
7357 : Well . Funny story about yoouuuuuu . Considering I don't know you that well . But whatever . Your funny , and apparently think I'm cute , so might as well keep you around . :D 
So I just learned that celtic woman is coming to Charleston in feburary . And I'm going to start begging my mother now to get me a ticket . 
33 : You make me smile with your awkwardness , but in a completely good way . You know I love your whole face , but sometimes enjoy a small laugh at your expense . I miss west side story with you and your trashy wig , buuuuuuuuuuut I digress . I love your whole self , provided there isn't that much . But still . :D 
So , today I was told I'm SNARKY . Which , I must say , is probably the BEST adjective EVER ~ ! Also , I'm pretty convinced < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > HATES me , buuuuuuuut , I'm also pretty convinced he'll get over it ! :D 
Has been accepted into Coastal < PROPFEMALE > University . BFA here I come . 
Number 1 : :D You make me smile when I'm glum and you're talented to boot . You bring out the best in people without even meaning to and I enjoy that ! I steal your food a lot , but that's only because I'm a fatass , not because I'm cheap ... well ... maybe a little bit of both . But I'm only cheap because I'm jobless . You can bet that if I had a job I'd buy you something nice ! :D 
I'm remembering why I fell in LOVE with POP-art in the first place . 
I hate this . 
I would really LOVE to go Christmas shopping for the folks I less than three ( <3 ) but unfortunately I have no money . D: </3 
Drawing again . :D 
So . Starting today there are going to be some changes . :) 
SSo Facebook is now in PIRATE . And I think I love it . <3

Chat roulette . You're so scary 
My phone is now gone . Temporarily . Until I can get it back from < PROPFEMALE > </3

Interesting night . I'm still not sure how I feel about it . We'll see I guess . 
Guess who's home alone ?! Can you say loud music and mid afternoon breakfast !? :D 
So ... Apparently I text \incessantly\ " in school and that's why I have bad grades . So I'm getting my phone taken away . I text I . First block ... Orchestra . " 
It's a shame you're such a fuck up . 
Just discovered I do INDEED have enough scholarships to pay for college . But I'm still applying my ass off . 
This is TOO MUCH excitement for one night . So I'm going to bed . Goodnight , world . 
How is it that I get a full eight hours of sleep , the best nap of my life in third block , ANOTHER nap when I get home , and STILL manage to be tired before rehearsal ? 
I hate you significantly more when you're drunk . Please just go to bed . 
So ... my computer is fucked . That's great . 
We'll see 
< PROPFEMALE > + Ukulele + Sci fi mini seris = great day . 
I'm pretty sure you just need to go fuck yourself . At least that way you wouldn't catch anything .
