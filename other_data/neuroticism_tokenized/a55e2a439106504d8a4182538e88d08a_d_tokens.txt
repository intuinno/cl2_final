If a nation expects to be ignorant and free , in a\ 
state of civilization , it expects what never was and never will \ 
be . Whenever the people are well-informed , they can be trusted with \ 
their own government ; that , whenever things get so far wrong as to \ 
attract their notice , they may be relied on to set them right . —Thomas < PROPMALE >
