If I were a pizza monster , I'd be dripping with garlic sauce . -winkwink- 

So I creepily stared at people today before class , they were scurred . 
Shoes and Dip . 
needs to find a cure to the Canadian AIDS 
heckleclam 
watching original Gojira , which kicks way more ass than the American dubbed version . They are still shouting \It's Gojira\ " though . ?????????????? " 
I feel like being ... NAUGHTY . 
I think it'd be pretty rad to have sexy time in space . Though I'm sure the gravity would make it hard work . 
feelin ' a lil ' frustration ... 
Feels like nothing's working out . 
Went to the hospital today , for kidney things . 
I seens How To Train Your Dragon in 3D . It was so cute !! 
I actually did most of my homework on time . :D 
Bleh . You should never feel bleh on Friday . Bleh . ~ 
I guess it's over ... or at least it seems over ... What did I do wrong ? 
Well , maybe things worked themselves out . Maybe they weren't as bad as I thought . 
I guess in time I'll see , will I just be second best ? 
When I see it I hate it , when I have it I can't get enough of it . 
Good weekend so far . And I got free pizza . Wuu ~ ~ 
Does anyone else worry that their boyfriend/girlfriend is way too pretty ? 
:D 
GRR ... I have three exams today , gotta get up at 10 and I have INSOMNIA . > : C Curse you finals week , you strike me again with your deadly \I'm gonna kill you with 1000 tests a day and getting NO sleep . Ahahaha \"" 
Well I am officially on summer break . Wuu ~ 
I'm not asleep . >.< 
Should I yell at him , should I cry over him , should I laugh with him ? Jeez , he's so confusing . @_@ 
Weeeeeeeee ~~~ 
Last night was full of crazy hilarious good fun . <3 
Someone took a hole punch to the area of my brain responsible for trust and punched out the space I had reserved for you ... forgive me if I never trust you ... 
I need to throw away all the old food laying on this chair beside me . >.< But what a hassle !! 
Gonna be in Pikevillioz on Saturday for two weeks , so yepyep . ( Also , that sucks ... sadface . ) 
Well I am back in Lexington now . Yay me ~ 
I'm pretty sure I broke my wrist somehow . 
The reason I'm a bad guy : They forgot to put chili on my goddamn chili dog !!!! 
So , the doctors just GUESSED that I had an infection ( in my wrist @_@ ) . They gave me a brace thing Just in case\ it's broken . And it makes my arm itch sooooo badly . " 
If I were a fox , would you wanna pet my tail ? -winkwink- 
Back from doctor , he tells me it's a calcification and it'll probably go away in about 3-4 weeks of my wrist being in a splint . So not broken , wee ~ 
Psyren . <3 
Why don't they make bloody , manly anime like Saint Seiya anymore ? @_@ It's actually incredibly hardcore . 
OMG I have potato bites ! <3 
I have a chocolate chip muffin . -noms- 
Lady Gaga always entertains me with her videos . And her body is A+ . So that's what I have to say about that . 
Finally just got around to watching Iron Man and the Punisher . Yay me ~ 
You said \I miss you . \ " and then showed me by saying \ " I want to be alone . \ " =[ " 
I wanna slap people when they're down just like France-nii-san . <3 
Phoo ~ Going to Pikeville tomorrow . =[ 
So I watched the first episode of Kuroshitsuji's second season . I was pretty pleased . Can't wait to see more when they are released . 
I'm in Ohio , it's .... too intense . 
I dreamed we were together and I was so happy , but then I woke up . =[ 
I flew for the first time today , it was so awesome . I was 2800 feet from Earth . 
It felt like flying ... because I was . 
Ore wa hero dakara ne . XD < PROPFEMALE > <3 Best reason ever to force yourself to do things you don't wanna do . 
Guess what , I'm back in Lexington . Hurrah ! 
Time for a nap after a Pandora Hearts marathon . =] 
Spontaneous combustion on Kuroshitsuji made my day better . ~ 
Sethy is totally going to jail . 
Why do I feel this way ? 
I love when people talk , perapera , and put sound effects , schpow , into the sentence . 
Well , it's time for that blissful sleep again , where I can see you and still feel ignored when I wake up . XD 
I hate you as much as I hate weasels ... oh wait ... I don't hate weasels . 
Time for sleep , hopefully I don't wake up pissed about a dream guy breaking a poor spider's legs like this morning . >.< 
People confused me , but hey guess what ... I have a brownie . :D 
;_; I cut myself shaving , how uncool . It's almost like I haven't done this for like 5 years already or something . >.< 
So I went to Arby's to get potato bites ( which are awesome ) and the guy who works there that normally talks to me tells me \You're always wearing cool shirts . \ " which is incredible since I'm sure I wear the same shirt everytime ( because I don't change ) . And then he informs some others that \ " We are out of roast beef . \ " ARBYS .... out of roast beef . Then he turns to me and says \ " That always sends them running . \ " XD " 
I hate when you try being playful to people and they are like \ok\ " . @_@ " 
I want to hurt you , so I'll feel better . Please suffer for me , so I can forget the pain . 
Grr . I hate when an anime shows me 50 flashbacks in one episode , it's not like I have amnesia , anime , I remember that without you showing me the whole episode again . >.< Also , I hate when romance is randomly inserted into a manly anime . Just BAM suddenly everyone's in love and it pisses me off . >.< Also , hamsters . 
I'm excited about school tomorrow , but that means I won't be able to sleep tonight . >.< Rwarg . 
First day of school was nice ~ 
“He’s a one stop shop , makes my panties drop\ 
He’s a sweet talkin’ sugar coated candyman”\ 
Also , I hear he has a big cawk . 
Lucky for me , my night was ruined right before bed . 
What the hell is going on ? I'm confused , man . 
Please ... just let me forget about you . 
Only 24 more seconds and then the food is done . Wuu ~ 
I guess a little disappointment every single fucking night makes things exciting .... right ? 
Totally getting ready to nom . <3 
So today I got a compliment from a guy in a car in the form of the \you're hot\ " whistle . Should I be pleased ? " 
When did I get so old that instead of \liking a boy\ " I started \ " liking a man \"?" 
Being ignored is the worst ... 
;_; The single sexiest man and best vocalist ever died . Daisuke . ;_; My dreams of raping him will never be fulfilled now .... unless ... >.> too bad the Japanese burn their dead . 
Kuroshitsuji II's ending was retarded . >.< 
XD ahaha Saint Seiya is hilarious . Bad lady's name is Mermaid Testis . >.> But\ 
the japs are pronouncing it like \TITTIES\ " @_@ Her name is Mermaid\ 
Looks like another lonely night . =[ 
I am going to < PROPMALE>'s Island today . Wuu ~ 
So I need to reinstall Vista , because it's an asshole . Anyone have an install disc I could borrow ? 
I'm pretty sure missing someone is the worst type of feeling . >.< Especially when it's because they've decided to ignore you . 
Don't get a big < PROPMALE > . 
I hate when people say \call me back later\ " and then refuse to answer your phone calls when ' later ' arrives . " 
I like it ..... all over the place .... >.> Oh yeah , and I don't < PROPFEMALE > a purse guys . \ 
Teehee . 
I had the most wonderful night last night . :D Happyhappyhappy ~ 
So today at school some guy offered me 1000 dollars to fuck him . I laughed about it and then his friend was all \What would you do for 40 ? \ " XD " 
So I got some sexy socks and underwear today . Wuu ~ Happy . 
Also , I've noticed a lot of men don't like putting \In a relationship\ " on their thingy ... What is the reason for this ? Embarrassment ? Still trying to get some ass on Facebook while dating someone ? Being a dickface ? I wonder . " 
People are slamming their doors all up and down the hallway ... it's ... kinda ... musical . Was this planned ? 
Damn you procrastination . 
I see you seeing me , beybey . 
Jealousy is a bitch . 
More confusing than you , I confuse myself the most . How am I the most confusing person I know ? 
I hate when I give my time and attention to someone to help them with a problem because they are my friend , but when I need them to do the same thing for me ... they ignore me . 
Fuck , I hate really syncopated , erratic drum beats . 
I saw Social Network today , amazingly it was pretty good . Also , I had a wonderful night . <3 Other than the imminent nap I'm going to need to take at school , everything is great ~ ( Plus school naps are awesome too . ) 
So some bitch just called me and wouldn't tell me who is was ... told me I should know and that somehow she saw me at UK . Anyway , I dunno who is was and she told me she'd come over . So possibly I'mma have a stabby death party tonight ? XD 
Shiiiiiiiiiiiiiit . \ 
\What ? \ " \ 
I don't want to be bad to you , I just want to do bad things to you . 
When I wake up I'm thinking of you .... and you're not who I'm supposed to be thinking about . >.> 
So I recently had the urge to maim and/or murder some stupid bitch at school today . She was complaining about how her parents took away her credit cards and gave her \a shitty car\ " because she did something wrong . Spoiled bitch was complaining about getting what she deserved for apparently the first time in her life . People ... piss me off . End ~ " 
Fuck a bunch of this wind . 
I have a test tomorrow and thus I deem it nap time ( instead of study time . XD ) 
I learned that chips are dangerous today ... one flew into my eye . MY GOOD EYE ! I WAS BLIND ! However , chips redeem themselves by being delicious . 
>.< Give me a break school , jeez . 3 tests this week , a quiz , a paper due , massive amounts of reading , next week : 2 presentations due ( one in full Japanese ) . > : C Fuck you school , I'mma take a nap instead . 
So , test at 5 ... wuu .... >.> Not really . I'm probably gonna fail . >.< Damn you Japanese Linguistics , with your ... Intransitive verbs . And face . > : C 
I fucking hate when I see pictures of dumb bitches with their lips in stupid positions ... look like fucking ducks . Stupid whores . Die in a fire . Preferably the same one so we don't have to waste so much energy or time BURNING you . 
Halloween night might turn out alright , wuu ~ 
Good night was had . ??????? 
Goddammit , I fucking hate when someone gives me 3928980345 motherfucking bullshit excuses . 
What a shitty day ... until the end , I guess . And delicious potato bites . 
Just got back from SugoiCon , and it was awesomes ! 
Fuck you , disappointment . 
I love when you call someone out on something they said that was completely retarded on their part and they call you rude . XD 
Come on Friday . And hopefully a good weekend . ^_^ 
Ah , I always want things I can't have , huh ? 
nawjb sbuhs , vn Why does that infuriate me so fucking much ? 
I'm getting used to the idea of having this hole in my glove where my index finger is ... it's actually pretty convenient . 
Despite having two papers due , I'm excited about today . Wuu ~ 
Gawwwww . I don't wanna write this paper . > : C\ 
However , I had a wonderful night and that makes it okay . 
So I went to Qdoba today and they asked the girl behind me what kind of beans she wanted ... and she asked the stupidest fucking question ever ... \Are they both vegetarian ? \ " kwehfaira9v8gscg ... I wanted to punch her in her stupid face . When the fuck have beans been made of meat ? " 
Marvelous , marvelous night . Happy happy desu desu ne yo zo desu ne . XD 
So I'll be in Pikeville tomorrow . But I have no phone . =[ Puu ~ \ 
Also , totally not happy to be unable to see my doll for like ... three days . >.> 
Bitches ain't got shit on Kadabra and his spoon . <3 
Kadabra , I choose you ! Use Bendy Spoon Mind < PROPFIRST > ! 
So I have two new pics of my cosplaying fun from SugoiCon ! You should see me being all sexy as a dominatrix and then all cute as Doll from Kuroshitsuji . ^_^ 
Well this day sucks hardballs .
