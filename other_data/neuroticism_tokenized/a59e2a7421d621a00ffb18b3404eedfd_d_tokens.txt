Whispering as those around you pass by , in hopes they don't hear you cry . One day they'll see what they've been missing all along . One day the stars will shine brighter than the sun . One day mornings will turn out to be great , just because you open your eyes to the new day . \ 
Maybe one day alot of things can happen , but today's not that day .
