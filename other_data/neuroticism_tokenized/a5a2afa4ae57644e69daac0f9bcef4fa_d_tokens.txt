Memory is a funny thing , I'm listening to Toad the Wet Sprocket and suddenly I'm transported back to my room growing up and can remember every little detail . Yet 5 mins ago I could have only described my room in the barest of details . 

I'm really sick of kid rock and this song of his that plays at work every few mins . It's now stuck in my head ... \I was born free ... \"" 
At < PROPFIRST>'s watching a hoarders marathon . Think I'm gonna clean up a bit when I get home ... 
The party's crashing us now . 
Second ep of The Walking Dead was so good ! 
I've decided to pass on snow this year . Thanks for being understanding winter . 
So , not big into comics/graphic novels , but I've recently discovered < PROPFIRST > Burns and his new graphic novel X'ed Out . I like it so be prepared for extreme weirdness if you check it out . I'm acquiring his previous work Black Hole now . 
RIP < PROPFIRST > Nielson :((((((((( 
Sometimes I hate complex emotions . 
\For those of us who feel deeply and who are at all conscious of the\ 
Odd dream last night . I rescued a bridge jumper , met with an old childhood friend , and helped the mob and yakuza . 
The Doctor Who Christmas special was very good , probably my favorite of the specials . Very excited for the start of the next season . 
Snowpocalypse 2 got me , stuck not even 300 ft from my house . Thankfully Wades , the gas station down here , was plowing their lot and they came over and pulled me out . 
Omg my external hd is dying . All of my music , pictures , and video is on it . Very distraught :( 
48 fucking dollars to fill up my tank , Christ . 
Never say I don't suffer for my < PROPMALE > . I decided to make some hamburgers , and bought some onions , jalapenos , avocado , buns , and meat . I diced one onion , went to caramelizing , st < PROPMALE > ed dicing the second and cut my thumb pretty good . I didn't let that stop me though , I finished the onion and put it all together and made my burgers one handed dammit . 
Ok so that was weird . I wake up and head downstairs to the bathroom , and as I walk by the phone it rings . I give it a quizzical look and answer it . \Hello ? \ " \ " Is this Martin ? \ " \ " Yes this is Martin . \ " \ " If you need any assistance call 1-800-xx x-x xxx . Goodbye . \ " * click * It was not automated . "
