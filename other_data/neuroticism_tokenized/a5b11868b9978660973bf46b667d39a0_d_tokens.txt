LateNight + DreamComeTrue(MiraiyosozuII ) + PhotoofNagoBeach = Total melancholy and homesick\ 
Oh , Lariel , don't leave your computer in my house . \ 
It's after midnight and I am still looking at the photo of Tropical Ocean while listening to DreamComeTrue . 
Here , I am listening to DeamComeTrue again and facebooking . Surgeon general suggest : Looking back past once in a while is good thing , but 2 days in a row is not recommended for mental health . sigh ...

22years ago today , around this time , I was sleeping in a pretty pink room at West Suburban Hospital , exhausted and miserable . Today , I celebrated this wonderful day at Borders's Cafe in La Grange , motivated and satisfied without pain or misery . \ 
Happy Birthday , < PROPFEMALE > . I am so glad you turned to be a happy human . \ 
Get drunk wisely . Love , your mama 
Quarantine Day2 . I must look like a zombie . an hour and half of Quarantine at Caribou Coffee in Winnetka before teaching 5 hours , then 3 more hours of Quarantine at Border's in La Grange after the dinner again ..... addition to 2 hours and half of driving to North Shore . I must be insane to do this . Oh , well ..... work is work . Got to do it . tearstearstearstears ..... sobsobsobsob .....

It's Nori-Ojichan's birthday . Make sure to write Happy Birthday on his Wall ! 
When I was showing 3-year-old student how to play Twinkle Twinkle Little < PROPFEMALE > , instead of looking at my hand on the key , he kissed on my cheek ! 
I love listening to < PROPFEMALE > practicing her flute . 
Today , I have emailed my fall schedule , I have made another bed in my garden , I took care of my finance , I did Facebook , Mixi and emailed all the people I had to . But I still feel I have not accomplished anything today .... I wonder why ...

Ate Korean BBQ , Stir fry Yellow/Green zucchini with Purple beans and celery , and Cucumber/Tomato/Tuna salad from garden , broiled potato ... all veggies from the garden . \

My colleague called me when I was chopping Onions . Stupidly , I've answered his call and suffered consequences .

5 teenagers are going back to their hometown this afternoon . I have to leave home before they wake up and will be back to empty home . So , I said Good-Bye to them last night .

I had 3 cups of coffee from Panera at the meeting this morning , and my body was shaking happily , merrily , and uncontrollably all afternoon . No more Panera coffee for me . 
Had a last supper with Lariel before she leaves for Ohio . She will be leaving my house any time tonight . Have a great second year of college . OK . Instead of feeling sorry to be by myself again , I would say \MY FREEDOM IS BAAAAAAACK !!!!!! \ " My house will be kept clean until she comes back . " 
Humming Birds came to my back yard ! It was the third time this Fall . 
What a productive day ! I love it ! and it happened to be on my mom's birthday ! \

am grateful for my grandma and mom who have raised me to have creative \ 
mind and enjoy every moment of life . 
I have been building a closet in my dressing room . I mean I have been trying to make one . I wonder how it will turn out .... 
I need Carpenter's glue and compound for my closet project . 
Sanding plaster is such a messy thing ! one more coating of plaster and then I will be able to start painting the closet and walls ! Oh , I miss using power tools ! 
Started painting primer on the closet and walls ! I hope I will be able to finish before Thanksgivings . 
43 . Jet ski across the Pacific Ocean 
This morning , a radio announcer was talking about someone who recently died at age 81 . I started thinking ... if I am to die at age 81 ... I have 34 years of life left . Then , I was terrified .... I don't want to live that long ! Especially , in this deadly cold Chicago ! 
Time to start cleaning my living room with piles of boxes . \ 
YES ! I finished building THE CLOSET !
