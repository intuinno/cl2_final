When you say a comment without really trying to sound evil and it causes chills from near by victims , what does that say about me ?

I don't like mess , just organized clutter . 
Been sick on the couch almost all day and still not really my self yet .... 
well feeling a little better but am still not fully healed . so took 4 different kinds of meds today and go to a little less then normal . 
tears 
had a really bad night and had a bit better day . 
statement was made : so if the computer has too many cookies , how many does it take to make a cupcake ? though what was cooler is she knew what she was talking about . 
A turn for a turn .... I don't like that phrase . Sigh traffic . \\n-hazelwings * 
Man i really don't like fish .... To eat i mean . \\n-hazelwings * 
excited that i have two days off with < PROPFIRST > and a more then normal freedom to do what we want ! To bad the weather is not warm enough for a park trip . 
I really need to have some sleep before i go crazy . \\n-hazelwings * 
Everyone please be carefull these next few hours and even more so there next few days . 
Wow too much in one day for me . So now extra stressed , sad , tired , and i have no idea what to do about any of it . 
So had to chip away at a frozen door to get in the house . < PROPFIRST > locked me out and all i had was a garden took\\n-hazelwings * 
Blah .... \\n-hazelwings * 
people are driving me crazy . \\n-hazelwings * 
Why do I feel so betrayed . Yet i know i would be and by the people i know would do that . Is hope worth the pain or am i just being blind by wishfull thinking . 
Ah work ... So early . But a plus no traffic . : )\\n-hazelwings * 
Yes , the two nicest days so far and i have them off ! Ok < PROPFIRST > to the parks ! Lol 
Why do i try to come up with ways to tell you things but then remember that nothing will either matter , or get threw , or just up set you , or all the above . 
well a ok morning but i don't really know why i felt like i could not enjoy anything i normaly do . 
sigh , he liked the guy who was not alive . 
thank you everyone for the suggestions and help . i am slowly working on fixing the broken and forgotten of my life ... harder then i thought and i thought it was going to be hard . 
My father makes me want to hurt myself really bad every time he talks to me . I need help . 
Anyone want to call just to chat ? 
I can't believe i am still up .... And i have to get up soon . Sigh 
I really want it now , sigh to bad for me . 
Japan i wish i could help you . You really did not need this . \\n-hazelwings * 
do you see me as me ? Or as i want you to ? Or does baggage cloud your eyes ? But do you know what it is ? for everyone has lots of clouds . So do you really see ? 
wow being hated by others that do not even know me . 
Believing in something is amazing , mostly . But we can forget that we may need to act on those belief , that can hurt others beliefs or damage what we care about . 
< PROPFEMALE > needs some help , i need a sitter for two children for about 6 to 7 hours . 
i am so tired of this week 
sorry for the crazy stats , life has been really hard to handle as of late and still is . i just wanted everyone to know that if i upset you please forgive me , stress can really change people even for a short time .
