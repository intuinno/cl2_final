If you have trouble text me , or if you don't have a credit card/debit card let me know ! We are leaving from < PROPFIRST > at 1200 ! 
so coughing sucks because that usually equals sick and I don't want to be sick . I don't have time to be sick . It's rather inconvenient actually . Oh well , I still got tickets to see Skillet on Halloween , so that is the light at the end of the tunnel ! It's okay to be jealous , I would understand . 
dude , i do not feel good . my mind is tired , but my body is not even though I am coughing like I'm trying to lose a lung . no voice again . damn . 
Much better day today . For sure . Drill tomorrow morning is going to rock ! First things first though , must sleep !

I just watched some of the best videos ever for Veteran's Day ! A tribute to Marines , soldiers coming home ! Oh wow . Our soldiers are amazing and to them we owe our continued freedom and ever our gratitude because we can never repay them for all that they have allowed for us to continue to have ! Most especially thanks should be given to those who fought before to give us what we protect now ! God Bless Our Troops ! 
is going to kill stupid people . Do not go after my friends because I will utterly and completely destroy your puny little world . 
< PROPMALE > is officially my hero . He is a total boss . That basically sums this whole thing up . 
is going to do a research paper in one day ! The one time that procrastination totally does not pay off . Oh well , I will just beast through it and be done ! Then go watch a movie at the House with < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > , < PROPMALE > Greenslade , < PROPFEMALE > Crow , and < PROPFIRST > McClain !!! Tonight's gonna be a good night ! 
didn't get to watch the movie last night , but I did get some emotional support from my guy and finished my paper . so it was a very good night . 
is feeling very productive this weekend . Maybe < PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE > should go to Canada for the weekend more often , I actually get stuff done when they aren't here ... 
just shouldn't even look at the temperature . It's a little depressing ... Oh well , welcome to Seattle ! 
one more day !!!!! I swear I can make it !!!! Would love to just take a nap all day long .... 
listening to Hosanna and feeling very at peace . Just need my crazy friends , my great boyfriend , and a cup of cocoa to be completely in Heaven .

We won !!!!!! Our whole team ( platoon sergeant and commander included ) just smoked everyone else on that drill deck !!! So motivating ... 
was totally motivated by all my new Navy gear , but then I had a flash from the past and am now not as happy as I was before . Plus I remembered my homework for tonight . That's a bummer in and of itself . 
Friday !!! You are so close !!!! Movie night tomorrow ? Shutter Island with < PROPMALE > Greenslade and Honping < PROPFEMALE > ? I think so !!! 
Wow , I forgot how long it takes to put up pictures , but they are all up !!! And if you are in Theta Xi please tag the rest of your brothers !!! 
just deep cleaned the kitchen in my apartment ... totally gross . People are so disgusting and I have a new reason to hate bacon . 
Seattle is BIPOLAR !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh well tomorrow is just going to be crazy ...

Started work today !!!! Now I get to 9-5 it for the rest of the week ( including Saturday ) , but still excited !!!! 
While all are equally lost theologically , not all have equal access to the Gospel . 
What is this white stuff falling from the sky in large amounts ? It's covering everything to make it look all powdery and stuff .... Why do I have to work tonight ?!?! I want to play in the snow !!!!! 
Working 15 hours on Black Friday : ugh . Coming home and talking to the boyfriend and making quick sugar cookies : yay ! Realizing I still have work again today : oh balls .

so glad I don't have finals right now . It gives me time to plan next year ... and Spring Break . 
Dude . Double days suck . Opening in one store and closing in the other . Bleh . Oh well , it pays the rent , but it keeps me from my bed ... Ew . 
Sometimes you just gotta roll with it . Semper Gumby . 
Didn't realize that I could work full time as a nanny or a dog sitter . How awesome ! 
Just spent the hour talking to my sweetheart , < PROPFEMALE > Montoya !!! Best night ever !!!! 
Posting pictures ( yeah , i know , finally ) brings back some good memories . I blame you < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > .

Stop talking , stop crying . Building the walls higher this time to hide the pieces . Fuck . 
Found my rhythm while running Greenlake :) Got caught in rain and a really cold wind :( Doing better today . 
Job offers galore ! Perseverance pays ! Plus realized Lent is in like 2 weeks ... What am I going to give up .... 
Looking back on the past month , I have decided that when God decides to show me how much of a moron I am , He doesn't pull His punches at all . But I just masochistic enough ( religiously ) not to mind after the fact . 
Love a good workout that makes me all shaky afterwards . That and bean and cheese burritos . Can't wait to make chicken tacos for dinner tonight . Text/call me if you want in on it . Dinner's at 6:30 y'alls . 
Hey ! Village Idiots picketing fallen soldiers ' funerals ... Yeah , I'm talking to you ! Do you know WHY you are allowed to do that ? BECAUSE THE DEAD SOLDIER YOU ARE TRASHING , GAVE HIS OR HER LIFE SO YOU WOULD HAVE THE FREEDOM TO EXPRESS YOUR STUPIDITY ! Feel free to copy and post-I did because I wasn't afraid to express my undying gratitude to every single service person past , present and future . GOD BLESS OUR SOLDIERS ! 
So .. I have seen a couple postings for the sibling war , but for the life of me I can't find it in my right mind to post it , not because I know that my sister will get to it within an hour , but because < PROPFIRST > Smith is the shit and I revel in having a worthy adversary . She is an amazing cook , seamstress , artist , musician , and is incredibly intelligent . Props to you little sister . 
You never know how strong you are until being strong is the only choice you have .
