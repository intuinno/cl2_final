< PROPMALE > Chigurh is the best bad guy ever . EVER . 

I'm looking for a cheap place to live in Rochester for a year or so . If anybody thinks they might have a lead for me let me know ... 
Gin . 
Life is hard , you say ? Compared to what ? 
Half of life is what we choose . The other half is what ensues . 
Airsoft was fun ! But my car died in the middle of the freeway and I had to get it towed , that wasn't so fun . :| 
Looks like I'm down 1 car . Oh well , it only ... costed ... two ... thousand ... dollars .... 
Hath any one verily existed a stones throw unwavering quite assured to employ thee venture yonder desireth to become appear vastly similar ? 
Apartment secured . I < really > wish that car hadn't died on me , though . 
My landlord scares the shit out of me . 
Sometimes I think I focus * too much * on things ... 
21 years ago I was born . I feel lucky to be alive . 
Gin will always have a special place in my heart but Cointreu was my first love . I haven't tasted it for ... twelve years , and it's just as good as I remember it . If you like oranges , and want to waste your money on a fancy liquer , this is what you should 
is a face full of side kick . 
? os ?? ???? 
Damn gravity ! Got me again ! 
What's it called when you mix just cointreau and < PROPFEMALE > ale over ice ? I've looked around and haven't found a name for this drink anywhere . I doubt it's an original idea , but if this drink hasn't been named yet I call it \Awesome . \"" 
What's the difference between a ruffian and a martial artist ? Erudition . 
When I think back on all the crap I learned in high school , it's a wonder I can think at all . 
More like Southern Minnesota Chairsoft Players 
Sleep ? SLEEP ? I don't need no stinkin ' ... zzzzzzzzzz 
I'm Batman . 
wants to learn Gongkwon Yusul . 
Now I live in Rochester . 
I didn't bite off more than I can chew . I just have to chew it for a very long time . 
Holy crap . Bicycles are so useful . Dang . 
GELATO . LIME GELATO . 
Okay so I've been going full throttle for the past week with the new job , new apartment and new town . Now ... I can relax . Also does anyone know if you can make an antenna for the digital signal out of coax wire ?? 
Life is grand . 
living without a car can be inconvenient but it also feels kind of liberating , in a way . I can't say I don't like it . We'll see if my tune changes when the snow falls . 
Ring ring ring ring ring ring ring Banana phoone Ring ring ring ring ring ring ring Banana phoooooooooone 
Lots of people come to the Rochester public library to take a nap . Hahahaha ! 
So all those MDs who tell us that caffeine is no replacement for real stamina and rest ... they weren't lying . 
Having experienced both I think I definitely prefer 15 hour work weeks over 40 hour work weeks . Hind site is 20/20 as they say . At least the second one comes with my own kitchen . 
I just saw a homeless guy walk into a a \do not park\ " sign . " 
So if you think your life is complete confusion because your neighbor's got it made ... 
On wednesday a second grader coughed right in my freakin ' face but I'm not sick yet . That has me feeling pretty fortunate . 
I'm pretty fortunate . 
Bike Wipeout #1 yesterday , caused by the slush . 
We ... wee-kend ? What's that ? It sounds vaguely familiar ... 
3rd grader : \Help I'm tumbling down the stairs ! \ " ( step ) \ " Help ! \ " ( step ) \ " Tumbling ! \ " ( step ) Aaaaah ! \ " ( step ) " 
Bike wipeout #2 last week . Gave someone a laugh at least . I narrowly avoided #3 . 
My resolutions : Eat More Vegetables Swim More Vaccuum More Often 
Everybody have a wonderful 2011 ! 
Coffee ? Coffee . 
Snow + Ice + Sharp Turn + Hubris = Wipeout #3 
The mall has been taken over by guys playing Magic cards . 
Am I a cave man or an alien ? 
I had sushi and hot rice wine for supper today . 
Has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like ? 
There were people running a marathon for breast cancer yesterday . I stopped to hand out water and gatorade to the runners as they passed by , and it was fun , but every time I heard someone complain about being cold I wanted to say \You're wearing a TRACK SUIT . It's FEBRUARY . \"" 
< PROPFEMALE > is dandy but liquor is quicker . Cointreau is both . 
What a long week that was ... 
I think people should take better care of their kids . 
My foot hurts because I kicked someone with it . :D 
What the hell is all this gray stuff all over the sidewalk and the roads ? I'm not used to it , there's too much traction ! 
Took the plastic down from my windows . 
ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff 
I don't have to negotiate ice , snow , and slush to get around anymore . I AM SO HAPPY . 
My neck and shoulder muscles are so exhausted that they cannot adequately stabilize my head , and so I get dizzy if I move around too much . Wooooooooooooo 
I'm so < PROPFEMALE > that if I stand in the sun and people look at me they're momentarily blinded from the light reflecting off my white-as-paint skin . 
Ever have one of those dreams where you can't breathe because your face is buried in the pillow or blanket ? They give you a neat perspective . It stops you from taking your breath for granted , every lungful of air feels like a gift . 
Ready to go back to school . 
< PROPFEMALE > ay Bay , < PROPFEMALE > ee < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > eye bicky bye < PROPFEMALE > oh < PROPMALE > bicky bye < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > bicky bye < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > o ~ 
Thought I'd kicked the videogame habit . I just got a cracked copy of Black & White 2 , seemed like a couple hours ago , now it's a quarter past 1 in the morning . What a time sink that game is ... 
Back to Rochester tomorrow ... where work is ... sigh ... 
I have internet at home now ! Give me your skype names . 
If I manage 60 hour weeks for the remainder of the school year I'll be able to do 5 hour work weeks for the summer . I'm seriously considering doing this ... 
I had completely forgotten what warm weather is like . It's nice . 
I'm going to start eating more fish . 
490 hours to go . 
Why's everybody so down ? It's Saturday ! 
Aaaaaah , nicotine and alcohal . 
Feels like the same amount of time passed in the last two weeks as in the preceding four months . 
I do not get this tired very often . 
Recharged . 
I'm with you , kid . Let's go . 
I have to stop causing so much stress to myself . 
Good spelling will make you seem more intelligent than you actualy are . -Garrison Keillor 
So apparently one of the teachers at my school's facebook got hacked or something and it was made to send a bunch of dirty pictures to all her contancts , hahaha ...

My Tuesdays feel like mini-Fridays . :/ 
Anyone know if there's a place in Rochester that sells rhubarb wine ? 
I'm all for making sure our kids are happy and content but there's a point where the self-esteem stuff becomes counterproductive . If a 2nd grader is an entire year behind in a subject DON'T TELL THEM THEY ARE GOOD AT THE %&*#@ ! %# SUBJECT .

And to think I thought getting these hours done was going to get easier when the weather got warmer . Silly me . 
Test everything and keep what is good . 
You know it's summer when you can get dehydrated walking around , waiting for the bus and doing errands . 
My life is much less dramatic than your standard facebook user . ( complacent smirk ) 
I will go mad ! Anyone care to join me ? 
WTF Am I doing up at 9 am on a saturday ? I'm going back to sleep . 
I will kill only in the name of justice , honor , or deliciousness . 
Last day of work at the school today ! Only 100 hours to go ! Should be an enjoyable summer . :) 
I am freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee . \ 
It feels great not having to go back to work at that school again . 
Good thing I live in a basement . 
90 mph winds woooooo 
A sparrow just flew in through my open window . \ 
I LIVE IN A BASEMENT . HOW IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE

My living room is now also the bedroom . What used to be the bedroom is now the office , and the microwave and toaster are now actually in the kitchen instead of the living room .

A squirrel keeps creeping up to my open window and looking in . He must smell the food I cooked or something , hahah . If he gets too close to crawling inside I go HEY and he scampers off , but then he reappears again a minute later . 
Spiders are so cool . 
Kind of on a metal kick . 
I like it when people call me pedantic . 
First they took away my fat , then they take away my sugar , now they want my salt ! THEY CAN'T HAVE IT . 
Well , I made the mistake of reading a lot of stuff about The Slender Man last night before bed . 
It's not okay to take advantage of people but it is okay to avoid being taken advantage of .

If I make it through this pre calculus class I will no longer consider myself bad at math . Slow , maybe , but bad , nah-ah . 
first pre calculus , then swimming , now supper : beef tips , gravy , homemade mashed potatoes , peas , and bread & butter . This was a good day . 
\People with ropes around their necks don't always hang . \"" 
I feel weird getting home at 7 and not feeling exhausted . :/ 
I built a sandcastle at the beach today . =) 
I cheer every time I correctly solve one of these math practice problems . 
I just spent the entire day practicing math , with only one break to smoke a cigar , drink beer and eat . 
Test today . : I 
I have never studied this hard in my life . 
I'm laughing my head off and I don't know why . 
Get 50 cc's of ketamine fast ! And get some for the kid too !

Ahaha ... oh boy . 
I think pan fried potatoes with onion and ketchup is my new favorite food . Easy , quick , filling , good for breakfast lunch or dinner . 
My favorite historical figure is Gerolamo Cardano . 
It is better to read books than it is to burn them , even if they say things you hate or come from a civilization you despise . 
So I almost chopped my finger today trying to cut open a winter squash , haha ... 
I had to do a chem lab with the most antisocial lab partner ever today- they would barely even talk to me . \ 
I hope I never have to put up with anything like that again . 
I love squash . Not as versatile as potatoes but stays good for so long , and so tasty ! 
I am a DEADLINE and I'm gonna GET YOU\

Radio , I don't care what kanye west did at the mtv movie awards a year ago . \ 
I don't care what is happening at the mtv movie awards now . \ 
RADIO , WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS USELESS CRAP AND CALLING IT NEWS ???? 
FINALLY got my financial aid check ... 
Why do I feel so impatient all the time these days ? Is it the coffee ? 
It's raining cats and dogs outside and I've got my laptop and chemistry textbook with me . I've biked in this weather before but I am SO GLAD I HAVE THIS BUS PASS . 
Got out of a math quiz today . \

Made hardy by the gods . 
First chem test , got an 80 . Need to study more . :|

Need a break from math . Think I'll go pick up large pieces of metal , put them down , and then pick them up again until I'm tired . 
That way lies madness . 
I just found out that the guy who plays Sallah in indiana jones is the same guy who played Gimli in lord of the rings . \ 
Mind = Blown 
I chopped the long part of a butternut squash into medallions and baked them for forty or so minutes on a pizza stone . I'm eating them now . They taste very , very good . 
A red squirrel just ran up to my window to cuss at me I think . 
So is < PROPFIRST > having another 300 year flood yet ? 
I WILL NOT EAT UNTIL I GET THIS ENTIRE APARTMENT IMMACULATELY SPOTLESS 
Renaissance fair yesterday was fun . \ 
Good food , good wine , good chocolate . 
Got a 13/15 on the lab report for that chem lab with the antisocial lab partner . Heh heh 
It seems to me that radio commercials are either really awesome or really bad . 
I've found that pretending something is easy can actually make it feel a little bit easier . The tradeoff is , you get a headache . 
The results of the Pew Forum's religious knowledge survey bothers me a lot . 
Saw Legend of the Guardians last night . Not bad , for cramming three child's novels into one flick . 
I need to stop drinking black tea at seven ... 
All I need to do is get a degree and then I'll be filthy rich . \ 
Right ? \

< PROPFIRST > Sandiego vs . < PROPFIRST > Bauer\ 
You're welcome . 
So ... got a ninety on my chemistry test . \ 
... how did this happen ... 
I found out today at the beginning of my chem lecture that there had been a mistake in the grading system or something . My instructor had copy-pasted from the wrong column or something like that , and our scores that had been posted before were therefore incorrect . He told us he'd get the correct scores in by 12:00 noon today . 
I had bourbon chicken , salted squash medallions , steamed corn and white zin with the girlfriend tonight . 
Took an afternoon nap and had weird dreams/nightmares about haunted islands in canada . 
If you told me a few years ago that I would someday soon be working as a math tutor at a community college I would have smacked you and said \Quit mocking me . \""

ITS GO TIME 
So what is it with squats anyway . I can run , I can bench , I can curl , I can do chinups and I can do lunges but every time I do squats my legs are just dead for the next 24 hours at least ... 
First wipe out of the season ! And without the aid of ice or slush . Happened as I tried to hop the curb on the way to cub foods , like I do multiple times every week . This time I clattered to the ground in front of a parking lot full of onlookers , and then had to spend the next few minutes getting the chain back onto the correct gears . What a hero I am ... 
I think that the amount of heavy metal ( blind guardian , and heidevolk in particular ) increases asymptotically as the hour of a big test at school approaches . 
And to think I thought wouldn't have to work as hard , going to school instead of working full time .
