In all the years we had Bush as President , I had never received a \participation waiver\ " just in case I didn't want to hear what he had to say in school . I just had to suck it up and listen . Now that Obama's President we need a freakin waiver just so little cry babies won't get their feelings hurt ? Grow the hell up !.... * sigh * I feel so much better "
