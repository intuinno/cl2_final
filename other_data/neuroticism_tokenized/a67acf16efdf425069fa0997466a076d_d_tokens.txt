The lesson for today is you should never mix Vodka w/ Champagne ... it makes you gay .. lol What in the name of all that's holy was I thinking ? 
If you have an intuitive or an instintive feeling , follow it and you will find that the universe is magnetically moving you to recieve what you asked for . 
I'm nothing in between to fall through .. I'm bein ' myself . Who are you ? 
Dont ' draw hearts around your friends draw circles instead because Hearts can break and circles never end . 
Remember what seems entertaining today ... could very well be the black < PROPFIRST > on your soul tomorrow :)

Tired of people being negative .. tired of Energy Vampires and whiney kiddie babies . I think if you can't spread love and happiness and all got is Bullshit Negative Judgemental , Hateful crap to spread then go Suck some place else .. away from me . 
These are my thoughts this morning ... you know how they have all these fan groups on here .. campfires , Starbucks , cookie dough .. well where the hell is bubble wrap ? I'm a fan of Bubble wrap and proud of it !

The rain must think i'm in love with it ... it seems to follow me where ever I go these days .. lol Rainy and overcast ... in AZ :) 
Life is my creation .. is my best friend . Imagination is my defense .. And I'll keep walking when skys are Gray .... whatever happens was meant that way ~ 
~ I pray to God that September's showers Rain down on her < PROPMALE > so that it may grow the Strength that Began with One < PROPFEMALE > ~ 
Communication Breakdown ... leads to Assumption ... Assumption is the #1 cause for Misunderstandings that come between people ... So Keep Talking <3 
Getting up and doing something productive ... Hmmm whatever shall I do ?

Incase anybody wonders ... this is my vampire name and I changed it for now in the spirit of Halloween 
Today is a Gift , not a Given .. I will use it to make people laugh at work cuz that's what I do best and it makes me happy to bring joy to peoples ' lives .. maybe helps them to take things a little less serious :) 
PRIVACY is just an ILLUSION created in our MIND .. especially in these TIMES .. it's a lot like the concept of what's FAIR you wish it was THERE but it just doesn't EXIST . 
Hope everyone is having a wonderful weekend !! love ya all .. be safe and fly straight :) 
watching a tribute to < PROPMALE > Mercury .. VH1 classic in concert

No more cigarettes .. as of today ! 
Let's see how forthcoming my facebook friends are . Leave a 1 word comment that you think best describes me . It can only be 1 word . No more than 1 word . Then copy & paste this post on your wall so I can leave a word about you . This should be interesting ... Wonder if I have 20 , or more , brave friends who will do this ? 
Turquoise 
Yes .... I believe Splendidy ~ licious is the new word for today ! 
HOW DID WE MEET ? Everyone play this game ! Copy and Paste this phrase on your profile . You will find it amusing to remember how you met and how you know each of your friends !! Before you do that , answer for me ... Please participate ! This should be fun ... or funny !!!! 
One of the few advantages to losing everything ... is that there is nothing left to fear . I have no reason to fear and nothing left to lose .. so to believe is what I choose . 
If bordom was fatal I'd be in for it .. Jeez things are so much better when I'm up to no good !! I'm home on a friday night behaving myself watching Retarded TV shows , reading New < PROPFEMALE > and messin ' around on FB .. Man it just doesn't get any better !! ( sarcasm ) 
~ Anything Boys can do girls can do better ~ 
if you were putting together a kick ass monsters of rock show who would be in your top five you would consider for the line up ? 
listening to the sounds of the ghetto bird flying awfully damn low around the house .. must be some criminals afoot ... lol 
This status is being tracked , the owners of facebook have confirmed they will send $1 to the rescue fund for the Haiti earthquake disaster for everytime this is cut and paste as a status . You only have to leave it for a minimum of 1 hour . Lets all do our part to help them . 
takin ' a Nap ... Zzzzzzz 
listening to the birds sing outside my window as my cat hopelessly tries to < PROPMALE > after them from the wrong side of the glass .. lol 
enjoying the cold , the wind and the rain 
Be thankful for what you have and dont worry about the rest .. be anxious for nothing . See that you are already blessed :) 
OH LoRd !!! My fine is 820.60 ... I think that makes me the < PROPFEMALE > of Naughtiness .. hahaha . 
going out shopping today ... Looking to buy me silver shoes and a dress 
Colts & the Saints in the SuperBowl .. woohooo !!! Saints R ' gonna get stomped !!! 
when you point fingers and blame you diminish your own power , the ability to create solutions and a means to make a difference .. so look in the mirror and restore your strength . 
You know what the difference is between Cougars and Jaguars ? Cougars are < PROPMALE > older women who prey on young men .. Jaguars are hot older women who are sought out and desired by young men 
If you are proud of your Dad for all the things that he has helped you with , taught you how to do , was there whenever you needed him to talk to and is still a blessing to you each and everyday , copy & paste to your status . So Proud of both my parents , they have taught me so much and I am thankful for all they do for me and my family . 
My wish for 2010 is that people will understand that children with disabilities do not have a disease ; children with disabilities are not looking for a cure but ACCEPTANCE !!!!!! 93% of people won't copy and paste this , WILL YOU be one of the 7% that does ...... and make this your status for at least an hour ! 
~ If silence is Golden ... Then duct Tape is definitely Silver ~ 
Good Morning all my wonderful FB friends .. Thank you so much for all the Awesome gifts . You Guys Rock !!! Remember to keep your thoughts positive as u go on about your day ... wishing love & Happiness 2 you all ~ 
If you gave me fame ... I would choose my freedom .. If you offered me Fortune I would choose love instead . 
I'll never be your dancing chicken .. I'm not a dog that jumps through hoops . I only rise to the level of my own expectations ; not what you think I should do . I have my own thoughts and beliefs and In them I have the strength to stand alone ... I'm not sheep who follows the crowd . I am an individual unique .. Proud to be .. I just love bein ' me ~ 
No One ever Told Me ... I found for myself . You Gotta Believe in Foolish Miracles ~ Ozzy 
< PROPFEMALE > means a beautiful woman who loves ACDC and sings it wildly while dancing around . Also shes the funniest bitch youll ever meet , but watch her left hook ! That bitch will knock you out like < PROPMALE > !!!! I got attacked but this girl < PROPFEMALE > for saying ACDC sucks ! 
Good Game yesterday !! Nice to see the Saints pulled through .. I totally wasn't expecting that !! 
Doing Butt crunches .. Squats and sit ~ ups !! 
I don't care for the home < PROPFEMALE > !!! when did we get to vote for this anyway ? where's the democracy ? and why do people have to go and change things that are perfectly fine ?! 
Hoping to go to Westgate for Mardi Gras Celebration on Saturday ... anybody wanna join in the fun is welcome to meet me there ! starts 7pm 
Happy < PROPFIRST>'s Day to you all !! ... Love & Hugs xoxoxox 
I was going out tonight .. but I hurt myself and so I had to stay home .. crap !!! 
So I went out .. In my new dress and had some Sushi and then I went to the bar and watched the allstar game .. chilled with some dudes . Not the best evening imaginable but that's okay .. I had fun and a few laughs . 
I'm going out on a date tonight .. it's been awhile and I'm kinda excited ... yay !! So I'm just thinking about what to wear ? 
UpDate On Date ... Well the guy wasn't exactly my type ... no love connection there , but the Sushi & Sake was to die for :) 
Just finished watching a movie \Last House On the Left\ " and eating pizza ... mmmmm . " 
So Sad to hear the news of the eartquake , deaths an devastation in Chile .. my prayers and thoughts go out to these people and their families . 
I don't believe that making mistakes discredits an individual .. it's not learning from them that does . Learning from mistakes allows you to be able to stand up and have a say about life and what's what .. through learning and life experience ( mistakes ) you acquire real knowledge . The kind you don't want to take for granted 
Went out to see a movie and I just got back a bit ago . I went to see Legion . 
wishing all my friends a love filled week ... wrapped up in Butterflies .. Sunshine and Roses . May your faith and belief in love & trust be restored .. Don't let the bastards grind you down . 
Hope everyone has a blessed day .. I am off to work !!

Just got done going through all my crap and reorganizing it all .. now that I'm done I feel productive and I can enjoy the weekend and Relax ! 
I will hold all my experiences up to the light of love <3 .. All steps are necessary on the road of life and when life hands you lemons ... make lemonade , set up shop and sell the shit or don't .. sink or swim it's up to you :)

\Nobody ever told me I found out for myself .. You gotta Believe in foolish miracles \"~ Ozzy " 
\And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress .. fearless . \ " ~ < PROPFIRST > Swift <3 "

Tired ~ drinking coffee trying to wake up so I can jump back into the Fire pit of Hell ... haha j/k 
Just thought of something ... It was 3 years ago today that my Lancer was totalled out in the front of the house ... where does the time go ? 
Off to see the wizard once again !! I don't need a heart , a brain or courage ... All I want is a damn tree that grows money or an ass that craps gold .. hahaha is that askin ' too much ? 
I will hold all my experiences up to the light of love ? .. All steps are \ 
necessary on the road to living life & when life hands you \ 
lemons ... make lemonade , set up shop and sell the shit or don't .. sink or \ 
swim it's up to you :) 
just a friendly reminder : Mother's Day is just around the corner so don't forget to mail out your gifts & cards . cuz yo Mama deserves to know how much you appreciate and love her .. soooo don't forget !!

On the road of convience there is always discontent .. so go out of your way and beyond your comfort . You never know along the way you may find what truly makes you happy ~ 
The meaning to life can not be bought .. it's found in the light of someone's eyes and that reason that just made you smile .. it's in the sound of random laughter over something remembered that you did when you were just a child . 
It just ain't christian that the Devils daughter has to be workin ' on a \ 
Friday nite while all you peeps are out partyin ' like Rock Stars ... Anyway Have a drink on Me while u keep me in your thoughts & prayers .. hahaha

Hmmmm ... just thinking this morning about how many followers we have in this society and how easily people can be led around like sheep . I was wondering ( I know I have my own thoughts on the subject ) from your perspective what is it for you that defines the line between what makes a leader and who is the follower ? 
I'd like to Know what \ 
makes you cry ... so I can be the one who always makes you smile :) 
Taking a 10-5 .... 
If you call out for me and there is no sound ... If\ 
you Look for me but it seems I am no longer around . Down by the Ocean \ 
dancing in the sand to the sound of a Rock N ' Roll band is where I'm sure to \ 
be found . 
Vampires , Romance \ 
and Werewolves ... Oh My ! saw Eclipse today .. rest assuredly there will be\ 
a review .. I've just been sooo overwhelmed by the Gayness that for now I\ 
am speechless .... 
My mind is on 3 things this morning .. it sucks when you know what you should do ... but there is something else you would love to do instead . 
vous êtes < PROPFEMALE > caramel chaud sur < PROPFEMALE > coupe glacée Chantilly et la glace de \ 
crème sur mon gâteau .. oohh la chose douce . \ 
être avec vous ressemb < PROPFEMALE > au réveil et à la vie de mes rêves

Going to get my cars ( Tumbleweed ) alignment adjusted .. gotta get it done Now .. she's been having seizures all over the road and Shaking like an old lady . 
I feel like playin ' the < PROPFIRST > game .. so message me a random number and i will post on my wall what i think about you and our relationship . 
#7 I didn't realize we live so close . We should meet for breakfast sometime .. so much time has past and it would be cool to connect with you and get to lnow you better 
#1 .. Of course u are .. haha . the abilty to make one laugh is priceless and in my book is valued above all else . You are the most intelligent , wittiest most sarcastically funny person i know .. besides my best friend . I enjoy your company , ur talent and I value our friendship .. I consider myself fortunate to have met you . 
#728 .. There truly is no one like you . your beauty that is you is truly unique and i think ur thoughts and emotions run deeper than most .. which i think sometimes leaves feeling as though you're alone .. I always wanted to just say hey sister you may have your own planet but you aren't alone .. haha I think you are groovy ! 
#56 :) you know what it's truly like to struggle and s < PROPFEMALE > nd in the face hard times . you've seen the darker side of life and probably every dark alley < PROPFEMALE > boot .. lol . Yet you still laugh .. hell u love to laugh . I get it because I too have seen the shitty side of life . We know complaining won't change it and as many tears we've cried .. it never made shit any better so you may as well laugh . 
#71 ) Never met cha .. but I know you like to cook ( you claim you are good at it ) and you are also a Reniassance man of sorts who keeps strange hours .. anyways cheers to you \\m/ 
#69 . I helped U in < PROPMALE > , U helped me in Math .. without U I would have failed . Tit 4 tat U were my friend .. we talked 4 hours on the phone & UR 1 of the few who knew all my secrets . As much as we annoyed 1 another sometimes .. I still think we were cut from the same block o ' cheese . Today .. U R 1 of the biggest Surprises 2 me ever .. what has happened in ur life I would have never seen coming 4 U & I just gotta say .... WoW ! 
#2 . Well my sister kinda likes u and u don't judge me .. u love me unconditionally , so u got these things going for u .. lol . I think u should know that whether people say it , show it or don't .. u R loved .. more than u know . From me 2 U .. life is to be enjoyed .. stay positive , be happy & treasure the people in ur life unconditionally . xoxo 
WoW .. my friends & family ... Thank you so much for all the Birthday wishes . I feel like a half baked oatmeal cookie that's just fresh outta the oven .. all warm and gooey !

#88 ~ I think we met @ summer rec . when I was knee high to a grassHopper . ( hehe ) not much has changed . Also believe it was u who taught me the importance of drinking alcohol with a straw .. I think it's fabulous that ur a cop now . u know when satan comes 2 town she needs some1 2 have her back . 
#4 .. Have I known u since I was in diapers ? probably ! anyhoo I loved it when you guyz would play ur music in my grannies living room .. I looked up to you & my uncle .. I thought you were like the Gods of Rock .. lol then I grew up .. haha j/k . I think it's great ur still bustin ' the tunes out .. I would <3 to see ya play someday :) 
Okay ... Chitlins , back to the < PROPFIRST > game . Inbox me with a number and I will tell you what I think about you & our relationship 
#2 even though we've never actually met I can see you're as sweet as cotton < PROPFEMALE > and you are indeed apart of my GN'R Legion .. you always post good stuff .. great pics & videos .. You Rock\\m/ baby ! 
#10 I'm sure if I lived back home we would go shopping for shoes and perhaps share tea & crumpets ... You have a beautiful family there that u & my brother have made and for that I give U props . stay true to U & the people around U . 
#11 .. I think ur sooo Ghetto ~ fabulous ! you're everything the SouthSiiiide encompasses and has to offer ! a poster child of sorts :) hahaha j/k . beyond that tho .. and your blantant misspellin ' of shit ..
