Headed home from school .

It really sucks when you choke on string cheese and cough it up and it gets stuck in your nose . Boo .

So I was really thirsty but didn't feel like getting up out of bed , and so I decided to drink from a bottle of water that I opened yesterday that was next to my bed . < PROPMALE > freaks out about drinking stale water and says he hopes I get hypothermia and hyperthermia at the same time and I die .
