Greenday last night .... wow ..... mind boggling . 

Ah , the sweet scent of success .... valedictorian , here I come ! 
Woooo-hoo ! Nice one < PROPMALE > . Congrats to both of you ! 
Lord , some days I feel like a whirling dervish , fresh off the desert . Travelling a night full of sultry scents and humid thoughts . Are such exquisities to be revealed ? Time will tell , but\ 
the heart will speak first . Godspeed . 
Here's a fun game . Name all of the people in my profile pic ( Bryanites have an advantage here ) . 
Start with me , with my clearly phallic code red mtn . dew . 
Finally , I get to be a Wolverine . Hahahah < PROPFEMALE > , time to f@$k !? g RUMBLE !! Go Blue ! 
EMU is seriously on my last nerve today . If one more thing hits me , I'm gonna get twitchy and stay up all night constantly re-evaluating the last three months of my life . That will do no good . At least I get to work tomorrow . Hooray :|
