just got back from church ! im soooo happy i got to see my man for the 1st time in two weeks ! its hard workin in time with my band and school , and his job , then he starts school at the end of the month . were making plans for next weekend , before i go to the braves game , to go to indian springs or dauset trails and < PROPFEMALE > out . its hard but were dealin . omg i sound like and adult who is havin problems with money lol ! 
start band practice tomorrow ! so excited about the eastside vs . alcvoy game , i cant wait to see my best guy friend and my 2 best friends girlfriends ! i got to see < PROPMALE > yesterday and i get to < PROPFEMALE > out with him saturday before the braves game ! yay ! i cant wait i love him so much . and yesterday i was so blessed to be able to see how truckers were blessed just to know that someone was praying and caring for them . 
dont know if school is closed yet because a 2 sewage pipes busted and a teacher was hurt i think her name was Mrs. < PROPFIRST > . Um ... im very overwhelmed with schoolwork , but please pray for the teacher that was hurt . oh and band practice went very well yesterday , we practiced the whole opener , and now i can actually march it without people yellin , LEFT , LEFT !!!! to get me back on step . 
i just broke up with < PROPMALE > please dont ask me why . i really dont want to talk about it . please just pray for me and definitly pray for him . please dont come up to us at church and ask what happened or anything of that type . its very hard for me and im sure it is on him . if u want to know ask me in about a week and if i say i dont want to talk about it , please reaspect that . thank you . 
is goin to the braves game today , hopefully i can get my mind off of < PROPMALE > for a little while . im glad that i have awesome friends to cheer me up and to pray for me . i appreciate all of your prayers . yes i fell in love with him , but i need a great christian guy who can be there for me . < PROPMALE > wasnt that . im glad that i was able to listen to what god was tellin me and shut out my own wants and desires . 
i enjoyed the braves game today , didnt laugh much , or smile . i dont seem the same anymore . it hurts to hide it , it hurts to show it . i just want to have an intamate relationship with God , nothing else matters . but its hard when its something that i didnt want to do , but knew i had to . 
Whatever you're doing , inside of me . It feels like chaos , somehow there's peace . It's hard to surrender to what I can't see , but I'm giving in to something heavenly . 
if anyone gets a wow or lol video dont open it ! its a virus it automatically attaches itself to ur feinds list and sends it to all ur friends . DONT OPEN IT !!!! repost this to all ur friends ! 
kinda like this guy , he's really cute . i dont know if i want to give him my number or not , bc i dont him to be a rebound and want to make sure i like him first . to let u all know im ready to talk about what happened with < PROPMALE > . he told me he was going to do drugs again for those of u who know what went on earlier , and he lied about that to get me to break up with him . what actually happened was he cheated on me . 
PANKEY IS MY BFF !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and go < PROPFIRST > !!!!!!!!!!! 
Im havin fun bein me and lovin Jesus . Life is easier when u live it with God . Everything's better when im standing next to him , and not having to worry about anything standing in my way . Yes , there are trials and obstacles to pass through , but i can make it as long as im standing right next to him every step of the way . 
i really miss my best friend . we were trying to set up a day to go to the movies and < PROPFEMALE > out or something , but like always there's something standing in the way . or some reason i cant go . its always somethin ! oh well . i guess ill just have to wait til i get to aee him at the sept 4th game when alcovy plays eastside . 
best firiend asked me out havent made up my mind yet , dont know what i should say 
well me and my best friend are talkin and now that it comes down to it , it doesnt seem like its gonna work out .. idk ...? 
kinda upset , confused , and dissapointed :( 
well evidentually its a definite no that me and my best friend are gettin together . um ... yeah so ..... there it is ....? still kinda confused and stuff but whatever . thats life . u like one person that goes down the drain , u love one person that goes down the drain , like another , so does it , now u like one and there it goes too ! 
please pray for me , it just seems like every guy that i like or even loved cant decide which girl he wants to be with . so dont only pray for me , but pray for all those boys that are too stupid to make up their mind . 
is tryin to keep my focus on God so much , but sometimes it seems like focusing on school is my only focus . Math is ddefinitly overwhelming me , even though i have the highest grade in class , it still seems like i need to do more to keep it that way . anybody wanna give me any kind of advice . could really use it .

u know how i said that i didnt think that me and < PROPFIRST > goin out screwed up our relationship ... i think i was wrong . he hasnt really talked to me since the night we broke up . u wouldve thought that he wouldve txted me yesterday but ....... he hasnt . i was gonna talk to him on faccebook a few minutes ago but i figured i should just let him have his space hell talk to me when he wants to . 
finally got the guts up enough to talk to < PROPFIRST > txtin him right now . conversation is goin pretty good , like it didnt hurt our relationship . it isnt as hard to move on once u hear those sermons that brother < PROPFIRST > has been preachin on at revival ! givin it over to god has been alot easier when u give it all over to god instead of just parts of it at a time . 
isnt goin to school today cause i dont feel too good . sry to all my friends at school . ive got a bad headache and my stomach hurts like somethin terrible ! ugh ! 
im dooin < PROPMALE > soul searchin . im tired of bein focused on guys and need to get my focus back on God . i dont wanna go through the motions ! i need to figure out the void in my life that im fillin with guys and fill it with God . please pray bc i feel like God is about to do < PROPMALE > works in me , its not gonna be easy . i hope i can stay out of the depression stage , if it comes ill be ready . satan cant attack me this time !

EVER !!!!! 
i really wish < PROPFIRST > was on :'( i miss my best friend sooo bad ! 
cant sleep . ive been thinkin about my best friend all night and i miss him so much . i havent really been able to talk to him in a while and just wish he was here . anybody know how hard it is dealin with your best friend goin to another school , and only bein able to text them or talk to them on facebook which is really rare ? its hard but i gotta keep holdin on and just keep cryin out to God with all that i have .....

I've stepped up to a challenge from a friend ... I am out to prove that 80% of my friends will repost , I hope I am right ! Let's lift up His name and make a statement ! Sadly 97% of Facebook Users will not repost this ... when Jesus died on the cross he was thinking of you . If you are one of the few 3% , repost this message 
Atheist say Why didnt God creat us perfect just like him and why would he allow us to sin ? Answer : God cant creat us to love him because if he did we would not have TRUE LOVE FOR GOD . True Love is a choice and not creating someone to love you . You cannot make your children love you because if you did they would not have true love for you which is out of the Heart 
why is a committment so hard ? if you say you wanna be with someone , should you really be scared of makin it official ? i always thought that when you loved someone you shouldnt be afraid to hide it , isnt that right yall ? i love jesus and im not afraid to hide it , i love someone else and im not afraid to it be known but thats still not enough fo him to committ . 
is tryin to figure out what happened to me in the last couple of weeks ..... im not myself ..... i dont know why ......??? 
I am in need of assistance for my upcoming band trip to < PROPMALE > , Florida . I have been working diligently to to raise the funds needed . The deadline for my last payment is due January 29th .

had a great time at the church picnic today . God was really talkin to me on that sermon this mornin . he opened my eyes that instead of focusing on the problems in your life and how to deal with them , why dont you focus on God's will of why he puts obstacles in your life . you may be goin through somethin right now but serve God through it all . Hes always got somethin better planned .
