What is my obsession with nazi movies lately ? Dead Snow , Inglorious Bastards ... I'm beginning to see a pattern . 

Left 4 Dead 2 Achievements are too easy . 
So , my trip got bumped up like a month 
Ride the rainbow 
Random vomiting on the phone with mom ... Bad combination . 
Ne camera of doom ... 
Is annoyed at the song your a jerk . 
milk and cookies : I love you . 
Navy equipment is like a bridesmaids dress , the Navy loved it intensely for one day , then suddenly stopped caring for it and left it to sit and rot in the closet where the moths will eat it away . In short , I'm in port , again .... 
Banana-rama , looks gay , feels gay , sounds gay , TASTE DELICIOUS !

OMFG Shingles Sux ! My neck looks like ... alien eggs ? 
Reach will be ep ! c

My god , I didn't go to sleep until 8:00 am , and its now 1220 . 
Passed my pfa , just need to retape . 
I'm mortified . < PROPMALE > elfman is the creepy pedophile man from oingo boingo . I can never watch nightmare before christmas the same way again . 
Can't sleep lately . And yet I fell back asleep this morning . Fml . I hope I'm not late . Gotta love facebook on your phone though .

Why offer bbq wings if you discontinued them ? Damnit kfc . 
I'm off to socialise with real people . It may be my last time having fun for a long time . 
Lol 13 hours later we level up and still plan on continuing 
2:14 . Game end . Twelve hours of d and d . I'd say it was a good event for what may be my last weekend in hawaii . 
The japanese truly are superior to us . In japan I can point at a picture of what I want to order , but in < PROPFEMALE > I just witness a non-english speaking korean woman trying to order a subway sandwhich by continuosly saying five to the lady . 
Lol I'm playing pokemon snap 
You know its bad when she spells out fuck my life . 
Today is the day . 
The sweet taste of freedom and mcnuggets . 
Thirteen and a half hours at 324 . God damn today is going to suck . 
Almost free ... I can nearly taste the freedom . It taste like grape kool-aid and fettucini . 
Finally free . Eleven hours of sleep feels amazing . 
First day off in forever . It was amazing . 
Today , I qualify ... I hope . 
If the devil is in the details , then that board must have been Hell . 
WTF !? Never got the call for relay for life . There goes my bullet ...

Brain control beats mind control .

My team ditches me , so I ditched them for what turned out to be a very long day . Sleepy time now . 
Found out that douchebag in the rack below me isn't a total dochebag , merely a half-douche trying to level up . 
We now bring you the 4kidsTV version of < PROPMALE > in real life ... 
Food is so far away . 
Finally getting food after 13 hours 
My god I am bored . 
Lunch = minibag of chex mix ... my stomach hates me so much . 
Muster time keeps moving up , work is going to suck tomorrow . 
About to eat a two and a half pound burger . I'm going to die . 
I feel like it . I got half way done in a third of the time before I felt sick . 
Well , a week away from going home and I find out that I'm crossdecking . Thanks 324 , here is my leave chit . 
I get to train my trainer tomorrow . Sweet . 
Firefly marathon , hot tea , and friends . Tis going to be a good night . 
I'm going to pick up Dead Rising 2 now ... SQUUUUUUUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE !!!!!!!!!!! 
I fear that October 12th may be to long to wait for this medication ... And yes mom , I'm going to call you later , but I'm on night shift now . 
I wanna go home ... 
Insomnia blows 
I love random quizzes , they make me laugh . 
Internet spam . Its in your email . Its on your facebook . And now it calls yo at 3:40 am ...

Ugh ... Swing shift shall be the death of me . 
II told them this was a bad idea , my ride is SIQ and I have no way in ... then there is the ever rising annoyance of my phone . I may just buy a new one . 
Hrrmm , I think I want to see the movie Burlesque when it comes out . It actually looks good . 
Still no sleep ... pills don't work ... not really sleepy , just exhausted . 
I used to have this friend , his name was sleep . We had a long and loving relationship , but we split up for a while , and save for the occasional pass in the hall we never saw eachother . Then I started taking pills so that we could be together , and I'm fairly certain my drug use has made her move away back to the continental US . \ 
\ 
I miss you sleep , please come back to me .... Ambian , here I come again . 
Fat men on bicycles , funnier than jewish people driving < PROPMALE > cars .
