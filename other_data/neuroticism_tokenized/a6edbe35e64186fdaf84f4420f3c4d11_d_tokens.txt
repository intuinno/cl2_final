I will learn to let go what I cannot change I will learn to forgive what I cannot change I will learn to love what I cannot change But I will change , I will change Whatever I , whenever I can 

If you enter this world knowing you are loved and you leave this world knowing the same , then everything that happens in between can be dealt with . 
HAPPY !!!!!!! 
Dont blame me , I was born Awesome 
I am weak and he is strong Me and God He forgives me when I'm wrong Me and God He's the one I < PROPFEMALE > on When life gets hard Me and God 
Life is like a blanket too short . You pull it up and your toes rebel , you yank it down and shivers meander about your shoulder ; but cheerful folks manage to draw their knees up and pass a very comfortable night . 
Im happy ! And nothing will change that !!! Nothing thats said about me or done ! 
Laugh as much as you breathe and love as long as you live !! 
Don't talk to me when Im talking to myself !! 
Follow your dreams ... except the one when you're at school in your underwear . 
Challenges come so we can grow and be prepared for things we are not equipped to handle now . When we face our challenges with faith , prepared to learn , willing to make changes , and if necessary , to let go , we are demanding our power be turned on .

Philippians chapter 4 vs 5-7 : Let your gentleness be evident to all . The Lord is near . Do not be anxious about anything , but in everything , by prayer and petition , with thanksgiving , present your requests to God . And the peace of God , which transcends all understanding , will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus . 
A human life is a story told by God 
Whoever said nothing’s impossiable never tried slamming a revolving door 
Why do people say \heads up\ " when you should duck ? "

We just have to remind ourselves that everything happens for a reason , and it is all a part of God's plan . It isnt easy to do but God wouldnt let these things happen if he knew we couldnt make it through it . I love you < PROPFIRST > 
Death leaves a heartache no one can heal , love leaves a memory no one can steal 
Perhaps they are not stars , but rather openings in heaven where the love of our lost ones pours through and shines down upon us to let us know they are happy 
Determined ...

Wish heaven had a telephone so I could hear your voice again . I thought of you today , but that was nothing new . I thought of you yesterday , and days before that too . I think of you in silence , I often speak your name . All I have are memories and a picture in a frame . Your memory is a keepsake for which I will never part ....... God has you in his arms and I have you in my heart . ( Re-post if you love someone in heaven )
