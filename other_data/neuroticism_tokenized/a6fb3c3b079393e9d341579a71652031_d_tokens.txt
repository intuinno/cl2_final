Yay ! Just finished the last of my homework for the first week of college ! I'm super proud of myself . lol 
I just started my first load of laundry at the dorm's laundromat . I hope no one takes my clothes . lol Then again , who would steal wet clothes ? Or even pay for them to dry and then take them ? lol 
< PROPFEMALE > and I went for a walk through Rexburg today ! That was super fun . :) We pretty much had a party at Family Dollar . lol It was a nice change of scene , I felt like I was getting cabin fever from being on campus for two weeks straight . lol 
Just watched The Emperor's New Groove , Quest for Camelot , part of the Swan < PROPFEMALE > , and the < PROPMALE > of Egypt with the girlies . :) It was super fun ! We almost built a fort in the living room with our blankets and mattresses , but we're way too tired . Probably tomorrow though . :) 
Why live in a cooking dorm when you can make teriyaki chicken in a crock pot and rice in a rice cooker ? :D lol That's what we are having for dinner tonight . lol 
Did you know that Girl Scout Thin Mints taste super good with Nutella on them ? Lol 
IT'S RAINING OUTSIDE ! i HAVEN'T SEEN RAIN IN TWO MONTHS ! :D I DID A HAPPY DANCE WHEN I STEPPED OUTSIDE AND IT WASN'T SNOW FALLING FROM THE SKY !

So my religion teacher wants me to ask at least SEVEN people what they think GRACE means and use it in a research paper . ANYONE and EVERYONE is welcome to post something here . I really need an honest opinion from anyone willing to partcipate as to what they think GRACE means/is . You don't have to be religious , in fact I would really like some non-religious views on grace . I need at least SEVEN . Thanks everyone ! 
I have a Disneyland interview tonight ! Wish me luck ! :D I'm super excited and nervous at the same time . Haha 
Feeling pretty good about the Disney interview ! Have to wait 3 to 4 weeks to find out though ! Ugh 
Oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh . Disney called me today and I MISSED IT . BUT ! They left a callback number for me to call tomorrow . They said it would take 3 to 4 weeks for them to get back to me , and it hasn't even been ONE !? I'm really really EXCITED !!!

This is probably the longet morning in my life . Why did I have to wake up at 7 ? O.o I don't even have class until 12:45 . 
Sorry , Facebook was being dumb and posted my status four times . Haha 
Is it pathetic of me to feel like MY LIFE IS RUINED because I chipped my tooth on a potato ? Yes . A potato . It's awful . D; I requested an appointment with a dentist for tomorrow . Hopefully they'll be able to fit me in . > < \ 
Yes ... It is pathetic . D: * cries for hours * MY FAAAAAACE ! 
Why does it feel like this semester's classes are harder than last semester's ? Is it because I don't want to be here anymore and I did before ? They're all foundations classes , there's no reason for them to seem so scary . Haha 
Okay , so Starbucks has got this thing that if you switch to a travel mug instead of their regular paper cups then you get coffee or tea for free . WHY IS HOT CHOCOLATE NOT ON THIS LIST ? D; Starbucks travel mugs are SO CUTE . But I want free stuff . I would just waste their tea and coffee . * sigh * 
I love how my news feed is almost entirely littered with < PROPFEMALE > Smith statuses . lol And how Skype works like CRAP . Ugh . :( For some reason the other end couldn't hear me . Hopefully it will work better tomorrow .
