There's one more thing to consider 
\It appears that we are less concerned with learning the \ " truth\ " about ourselves than with reinforcing a familiar self-concept . \"~ Adler \ " Looking Out Looking In\ " Guess I need the truth to help the whole !!! " 
Hummadiddy , hummadiddy , hummadiddy !!! HaHa ! Lovin ' life , and my man !! Ready for the weekend ! ; ) 
The time bomb is ticking , and no listening\ 
Our future is fading , is there any hope we'll survive ? \ 
Still we ravage the world that we love\ 
And the millions cry out to be saved\ 
Our endless meniacal appetite left us with another way to die\ 
It's just another way to die\ 
... 
What happens to a dream differed ? \ 
Does it dry up\ 
Like a raisin in the sun ? \ 
Or fester like a sore-\ 
And then run ? \ 
Does it stink like rotten meat ? \ 
Or crust and sugar over-\ 
Like syrupy sweet ? \ 
Maybe it just sags\ 
Like a heavy load . \ 
Or does it explode ? \
