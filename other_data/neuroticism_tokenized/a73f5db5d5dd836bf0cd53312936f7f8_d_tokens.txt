.. and they all look like carp ( fish ) and drive mini-vans very badly and tuition at Lycoming College for a 4-week summer session ( 4 college credits ) of A&P = $1846 not counting books . Compared to South Plains College , Levelland , TX same credits = $104 . < PROPFEMALE > = $462 , TX = $26 p/hour . Maybe that's why there are so many idiots here - who could afford to become educated . Aghhh !!
