Had alot of fun yesterday ! :] 
Time to clean up ... \

This weekend has been insanely fun !! :3 \ 
But exhausting ... 
Almost finished my photography project ... and then it started to rain . >_> \ 
Guess I can move on to my other homework now . Joy . 
Anyone free tomorrow at 2:30 that's NOT going to prom ...? 
But drenched in vanilla twilight , I'll sit on the front porch all night . Waist-deep in thought because when I think of you , I don't feel so alone . ~ Vanilla Twilight ( Owl City ) 
If anyone is planning on buying Murder Mystery tickets from me , I need the money ASAP . $15 for lots of fun ! :3 
GREAT concert , everyone ! And to the leaving seniors , I'll miss you all very much and I wish you the best of luck next year . :] 
I was so excited that I was gonna get my trumpet back tomorrow , but when I called the lady back tonight about payment the store was closed . I have to wait longer for my trumpet ... probably . Sad face . 
Murder Mystery Dinner Theatre tomorrow and I get to be in it !! :D \ 
Okay , I'm a server , but if you come we'll all be in 40's garb and it'll be REALLY fun . Just sayin ' . ;] 
Had loads of fun at the Murder Mystery Dinner ! I'll be there tonight , too . :]

Last night = AMAZING . Thanks for a great time everyone ! Yeah , I'm talkin ' to the members of the funeral party . ;] 
Guess what I did today ! I GOT SOME WRITING DONE . It's amazing . :] 
You were always pretty reckless with your love . Come with the sun and get it restless when it's gone . And when you go , you'll leave me breathless and alone . You leave me breathless ; when you close the door it feels like you took the air out of the room with you . 
Really shouldn't have put her photography project off to the last minute ... v.v ;\ 
Friends beware ! I'll be taking your picture tonight at the concert ( this includes you , spectators ! ) . Wanna help ? Tell me what represents me and how you view me . :/ 
likes thunderstorms . ? 
Summer is so CLOSE . I wish it would hurry up ! 
Ever had that urge to just ... scream ? 
hanging with < PROPFEMALE > Gentilini and < PROPFEMALE > Jacobson :)) 
Feel the rain on your skin , no one else can feel it for you . Only you can let it in , no one else . No one else can speak the words on your lips . Drench yourself in words unspoken , live your life with arms wide open ... 
Marching band this year will be so FUN . Er ... I mean ... scary ! \ 
XD

Alright , why not ? Like this status and I'll post something I like about you on your wall . :] 
I have just spilled the biggest secret of my life . Wow .

If you're happy and you know it clap your hands ! If you're happy and you know it and you really wanna show it , if you're happy and you know it clap your hands !! ( I'm happy , can you tell ?! ) :D 
Last day of school ... I'm nervous , excited and .... sad ! D ' : 
I can finally see , that you're right there beside me . I am not my own , for I have been made new . Please don't let me go ... I desperately need you . 
Where should I go to get my haircut ...? :/ 
Today was just not a good day ... > 3 > \ 
Except when < PROPFEMALE > Holland and < PROPFEMALE > Gentilini came over . :] 
Time to babysit ...

Now I'm packing for the anime con tomorrow ! ;3 
I'm off to the anime con !! Goodbye common sense ! ;3 
I'm ba ~ ack !! :D 
Fallin ' from grace , I'm all over the place ... 
So I went to the eye doctor today to find out that my eyesight has IMPROVED and I'm LESS near-sighted than I was before . 0_o 
Now that we're here , it's so far away - all the struggle we thought was in vain . All the mistakes one life contained , they all finally start to go away . Now that we're here , it's so far away and I feel like I can face the day . I can forgive and I'm not ashamed to be the person that I am today . 
So , I was thinking ... maybe I should start a blog since I like talking so much . I'm not saying that it'd be interesting to read , but what do you think ? Good or bad idea ? 
The Autumn leaves join in a bittersweet chorus\ 
A hymn so inspired as if to inform us they're leaving soon\ 
She sends a kiss that we just barely miss\

You can take my breath away ... 
Had a fun time looking for cosplay outfits with < PROPFEMALE > St < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > Jacobson , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > ! :D 
Passed my permit test today ! Got some Chinese food from Mei < PROPFEMALE > to celebrate . :3 
Played Thriller earlier and got it stuck in my family's heads !! >:D 
Look up , I look up at night , \ 
Planets are moving at the speed of light . \ 
Climb up , up in the trees , \ 
every < PROPMALE > that you get , \ 
is a < PROPMALE > you seize . \ 
How long am I gonna stand , \ 
with my head stuck under the sand ? \ 
I'll start before I can stop , \ 
before I see things the right way up . 
Awesome week ahead ! BAND CAMP . :D 
Farmington band geeks get down with Thriller !! \ 
;D 
Is everyone okay ...? 
Who's gonna fight for what's right ? Who's gonna help us survive ? We're in the fight of our lives , and we're not ready to die . Who's gonna fight for the weak ? Who's gonna make ' em believe ? I've got a hero , I've got a hero living in me . I'm gonna fight for what's right , today I'm speaking my mind . And if it kills me tonight I will be ready to die . 
had an AWESOME day with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Folie ... he took my choco-nutter virginity . ;D 
Got my schedule today ( see my note ) , < PROPMALE > out at the home tennis match with < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Strombeck ... then < PROPMALE > out with < PROPFEMALE > ! Fun fun day !! :D 
What's this ? A free day ?! Anyone wanna do something ? :] 
Had a fun day hanging out with < PROPFEMALE > Holland and < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Folie !! :D 
Went to the tennis match with < PROPFEMALE > Jacobson to watch < PROPFEMALE > Gentilini ! Saw a bunch of my friends there . :] \ 
Now ... boredum . And cleaning . 
Crap ... 
Cause everything inside it never comes out right , and when I see you cry it makes me want to die . I'm sorry I'm bad , I'm sorry you're blue , I'm sorry about all things I said to you , and I know I can't take it back . I love how you kiss , I love all your sounds , and baby the way you make my world go round , and I just wanted to say I'm sorry . 
Yesterday was fun ! < PROPMALE > out with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Folie all day ( this is starting to be a pattern in my statuses ... ) ! Then performed at Empire township with all my bestest buddies . :D 
Guess who looks homocidal in their permit picture ? That's right , me . \ 
.__. 
Dear summer , \ 
I know we didn't get to spend much time together this year , but I had a lot of fun these past few weeks . Let's have fun on this last day together , okay ? See ya next year ! :D 
Enjoyed my last day of summer with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Folie and < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > !!! Actually looking forward to school tomorrow ! See everyone there ! :D 
Second day of school and I already come home exhausted ... I love it ~ ! \ 
This is going to be an awesome year ! :D 
Did anyone catch when the Peers for Peers meeting is ? I wanna join . :] 
Looking back at me , I see that I never really got it right - I never stopped to think of you . I'm always wrapped up in things I cannot win . 
Just drove on the freeway ... I am forever humbled . 0__0 
:] 
Just got back from my cousin's wedding . It's crazy , I hadn't seen her in years ! Time seems to fly past so quickly these days . :/ 
Going to the Gopher football game with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Folie to see the marching band ! :D 
Is about to dive into the deep pile of homework she left until the last day ... sigh . 
Oates is the epitome of evil . T_T 
Mmmm .. Tic-tacs . :3 
First behind the wheel complete ! :D 
Ah , nothing like creeping on peoples facebook profiles . ;] 
I love my friends . So very much . <3 \ 
Nothing like being a geek . ;] 
Nothing like homecoming week to keep ya busy ! I love it ! :D 
Just keep on smiling . :) 
Sometimes I wish I'd listen to myself . .____. 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Folie knows what he's talking about ! I'll never doubt his opinions again . :D \ 
<3 
Spending all day with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Folie = EPIC . \ 
Therefore , this weekend = REALLY EPIC . :D \ 
How am I spending my 10/10/10 ? Doing homework I didn't do earlier ... fun fun . 
Farmington bands rocked the house !! :D \ 
<3 <3 
Gasp ! Moi , stage manager for the fall play ?! I'm excited !! :D 
I needed a new status . Haha , so here it is . :P 
[ Insert epic status here ] 
Went back to Akin Road and visted old teachers ! It's crazy how quick my school days seem to be going by ! :o 
< PROPMALE > out with < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ( Gabe the Babe ) today ! 8D\ 
Still , I'm ready for break to be over ... I'm sooo bored . D: 
watching Phineas and Ferb ! I <3 < PROPFIRST > and Dr. Doofenshmirtz . \ 
You know you're bored when you've spent over an hour on facebook taking lame quizzes ... 
Dear APUSH , \ 
I do believe we have what is called a love-hate relationship . \ 
I love history , I really do . But the long chapters in our textbooks gives me headaches . And Oates is ... well ... it's the epitome of evil . Have mercy . \ 
Love , \ 
April 
One minute I held the key , next the walls were closed on me . And I discovered my castles stand upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand . I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing , \ 
< PROPMALE > Calvary choirs are singing . Be my mirror , my sword , my shield . My missionaries in a foreign field . For some reason I can't explain once you'd gone there was never , never an honest word . But that was when I ruled the world . 
My father just walked into my room dressed as a woman . Blond wig , balloon-stuffed bellyshirt , skirt and all . Granted , it's for a haloween party , but ... I don't think he has any right to call ME strange . ;) 
How does April spend Haloween ? Giving away her chocolate and doing APUSH homework . Love it . 
Can I just say that these people make my life ? Here : < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Strombeck , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Folie , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Phillips , and < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > are all AWESOMESAUCE . Love you guys ! You're the best . :D <3 
This morning I woke up with 78 emails and 47 notifications . I <3 my friends . And their creeper wars . :] 
Life lifts me up and throws me down . It makes me laugh and it makes me cry . I love it and I hate it . But no matter what , I get right back up and face it with a smile , because that's just who I am , and I'll never let that be compromised . :) 
Went driving to the mall with my dad today . On the way back , some lady tailgates me and flashes me with her highbeams for going the speed limit . Conveniently enough , there was a stoplight at the end of the road and we pulled up right beside her ... where my dad rolled down his window and promptly cursed her out . Thanks dad ! :D 
This is an April status all about a very awesome < PROPFEMALE > Kefen , because I love her . And we laugh a little bit TOO much together . I <3 you !! :D 
My friends = awesomesauce . <3 
Whaaaaat ?! Snow ? Thanks for all the facebook statuses telling me , cause I totally wouldn't have known otherwise !! ;O 
< PROPMALE > Goodwin concert = awesomesauce of epic proportions . \ 
And that's an understatement . \ 
Dear procrastination ... I hate you . I don't have time to do my homework today , but you couldn't resist showing yourself yesterday in the face of Oates . This week I'm ignoring you because I'm very , very busy , and I can't afford tons of late work . That is all . 
My mother : \Wait ! So if you're in Wind Ensemble 
Tonight was awesomesauce ! The play went amazingly well ( not that I had any doubts ! ) , I'm so proud of you all ! :D \ 
Then went to DQ with my favourite people !! <3<3 \ 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Strombeck makes me laugh too much . XD 
It's hard to believe the fall play is already over . D: \ 
I'm so proud of everyone on the cast , and I'm so grateful I was able to be a part of it . It was so great to make new friends , meet new people , and grow closer to some people I already knew . Thank you all ! \ 
I hate scanning machines . So , so much . \ 
With their stupid software and their stupid ink and their stupid scanning ... thingy !! >:/ 
Mission accomplished !!! :D 
Chose your attitude . ;) 
When , exactly , should I start to question my own sanity ...? 
Have I mentioned that < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Strombeck and < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Folie are my besties ? No ? It's true . :D 
This status is dedicated to my two , very best friends . They are my heroes ; the milk to my Oreos , the peanut butter to my jelly , and the macaroni to my cheese . They're there with me , through think and thin , and I thank whatever higher power there is that I've met them . < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Folie , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Strombeck ... I love you both to death ! 
Do you ever feel so paper thin\ 
Like a house of cards , one blow from caving in ? \ 
Do you ever feel already buried deep ? \ 
Six feet under screams , but no one seems to hear a thing . \ 
Do you know that there's still a < PROPMALE > for you\ 
Cause there's a spark in you ? \ 
You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine . \ 
Just own the night , like the 4th of July\ 
' Cause baby , you're a firework . 
Has had a sudden , yet important revelation . 
Psh ! You say \creeper\ " like it's a bad thing ! :O " 
Only after TWO HOURS of us searching in Barnes and < PROPMALE > for a book , does < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Folie decide that maybe , just maybe , he should ask someone to help him find it ... 
It's official - the universe hates me . 
Ooh , I love my friends . So very much . :) 
With Chinese food and Hi-C as fuel , I've actually accomplished something ! The majority of my drawing ! :D 
I stumbled forward and you let me walk away\ 
We both know I’ll be running back to you someday\ 
I don’t know anything\ 
The earth is spinning but my feet are standing still\ 
And the wind is biting but I’m fighting off the chill\ 
I don’t know anything 
The sheer awesomeness of < PROPMALE > Bergeron and JazzMn combined was too much for me - I cried ... literally . Does that make me a geek ? 
< PROPFEMALE > ... anyone know where I should apply for a job ? :) 
' Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me\ 
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be\ 
Thinking maybe I'll come back here to the place that'd we'd meet\ 
And you'd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street . \ 
So I'm not moving . \ 
I'm not moving . 
The times you don't want to wake up\ 
' Cause in your sleep it's never over when you give up\ 
The sun is always going to rise up\ 
You need to get up , gotta keep your head up\ 
Look at the people all around you\ 
The way you feel is something everybody goes through\ 
Dark out , but you still gotta light up\ 
You need to wake up , gotta keep your face up 
Sometimes the \little\ " things make the biggest difference . " 
I love re-discovering amazing bands . :) 
Dear sleep , \ 
... \ 
I miss you . 
Why is it so hard to get a job ? D: 
Just got my braces off . NBD . :D 
Recap of my day : \ 
Stuffed bear and lots of chocolate . \ 
Got my braces off , and an awesome mini-trumpet thing from Mr. Gottwig ( which is going good , by the way ! )\ 
A nice stranger at < PROPFIRST>'s Club bought croissants for < PROPFEMALE > and I . \ 
Watched movies with < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > while eating pizza and ice cream . \ 
Cool beans ? \ 
I think yes . \ 
Be the fruit loop in a world of cherrios . ;) 
Trumpet exercises from < PROPFIRST > ! \ 
... for some reason , my lips are still tingling ! In a good way , though . (: 
I guess I don’t know what to say anymore\ 
\ 
I wish I knew all the right words to make this okay\ 
Even better , I wish I had the courage to say them 
I honestly don't know what to do anymore , because everything I do makes things worse . I guess I should have known . 
Mr. Malin decided to give us an assignment TODAY . But not any assignment - an assignment we've already done . Am I the only one who doesn't see the logic in this ...? : $ 
I had too much fun tonight shouting out random condiments at the Mayo team ( get it , mayo ? ) and hanging out with the cool people < PROPMALE > Hyde-Olson and < PROPFIRST > Cline !! (: 
Who's to say that one person can't make a difference ? \ 
It takes one person to stand up for what's right , and one person to do the unthinkable . \ 
One person could save a life - or a thousand lives . \ 
Will that person be you ? \ 
Will you take the time out of your day to smile at someone , or tell them you care ? Sometimes that's all it takes . \ 
You CAN make a difference , the question is ... are you willing to try ? 
And you dropped a note , and we changed keys\ 
You changed yourself , and I changed me\ 
I didn’t really see us singing through this . \ 
But you screamed the bridge , and I cried the verse\ 
And our chorus came out unrehearsed . \ 
And you smiled the whole way through it \ 
I guess maybe that’s what’s worst . 
Soooo glad to be back . (: 
Job interview today ... wish me luck ! :o 
I hate being sick . I don't have time to be sick . : l 
Enough . \ 
I get it , okay ? \ 
You can stop lying now . 
Job ? I think yes . (: 
Sooo , anyone know when the musical performances are ? I'm trying to get some days off in April ! :o 
I have now learned that some people just cannot function on three hours of sleep ... Lolz 
Chocolate milk . <3
