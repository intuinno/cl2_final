It is a common belief that cats are color blind . However , recent studies have shown that cats can see blue , green and red . 
Cats can't taste sweets . 
Cats must have fat in their diet because they can't produce it on their own . 
Tylenol and chocolate are both poisionous to cats . Many cats cannot properly digest cow's milk . Milk and milk products give them diarrhea . The average cat food meal is the equivalent to about five mice 
< PROPMALE > was STERILE ! - If a male cat is both orange and black it is ( besides being extremely rare ) sterile . To have both the orange and the black coat colors , the male cat must have all or part of both female X chromosomes . This unusual sex chromosome combination will render the male cat sterile . 
In the Middle Ages , during the Festival of Saint < PROPFIRST > , cats were burned alive in town squares . 
Baking chocolate is the most dangerous chocolate to your cat 
In ancient Egypt , when a family cat died , all family members would shave their eyebrows as a sign of mourning . Cats have been domesticated for half as long as dogs have been . 
< PROPMALE > Ceasar , Henri II , < PROPFIRST > XI , and < PROPMALE > were all afraid of cats 
Both humans and cats have identical regions in the brain responsible for emotion . A cat's brain is more similar to a man's brain than that of a dog . 
Cats respond most readily to names that end in an \ee\ " sound . A cat will tremble or shiver when it is extreme pain " 
In relation to their body size , cats have the largest eyes of any mammal . 
Declawing a cat is the same as cutting a human's fingers off at the knuckle . There are several alternatives to a complete declawing , including trimming or a less radical ( though more involved ) surgery to remove the claws . Preferably , try to train your cat to use a scratching post . 
A steady diet of dog food may cause blindness in your cat - it lacks taurine 
Cats respond better to women than to men , probably due to the fact that women's voices have a higher pitch . 
Tests done by the Behavioral Department of the Musuem of Natural History conclude that while a dog's memory lasts about 5 minutes , a cat's recall can last as long as 16 hours . 
Ailurophile - that's what we're officially called . It's what cat lovers are known as . 
A cat that bites you for rubbing his stomach is often biting from pleasure , not anger . -This explains alot lol . 
The more cats are spoken to , the more they will speak back . You will learn a lot from your cat's wide vocabulary of chirps and meows . 
In general , cats live longer than most dogs . An average life span might be 12 to 14 years , with some cats reaching 20 and more . A cat's longevity depends on whether or not it lives indoors or is allowed outdoors ( outdoor cats live an average of eight years ) , 
It was once generally thought that one year in the life of the cat was equivalent to seven years of a human life . A new scale of equivalents is now recognized : after the first two years , the cat's life proceeds more slowly in relation to human life and each feline year is approximately four human years . 
Vikings used cats as rat catchers and companions . 
Cats absolutely hate any citrus smells – orange , grapefruit , lemons and limes . 
Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it . 
SOmeone give me a reason not to go to class at 2 ... please ? 
You know what it could be ? Past life experience intruding on present time ?

“Yes , I would just like to say I’m sailing with the rock , and I’ll be back , like Independence Day with Jesus . June 6 , like the movie . Big mother ship and all , I’ll be back , I’ll be back . ”-Aileen Wuornos ' last words .

A group of kittens is called a “kindle” ( yes , just like that fancy new electronic book device available now ) , while a group of adult cats is called a “clowder . ” 
We all know the meow sound , whether it’s questioning , scared , happy , or imperiously demanding dinner . Curiously , cats only meow at people , not at other cats . 
Unless you want a “clowder” of cats cluttering your home , spay , and neuter your furry feline . Just one pair of cats and their kittens can produce 420,000 (!) offspring in a mere seven years
