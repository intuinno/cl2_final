Good Luck to OSU ! 

try this -- post this to your wall and see what kind of responses you get -- If you saw ME in a police car what would you think I got arrested for ? 
Ok -- OSU lost but maybe < PROPMALE > can redeem the day and beat Thaigo < PROPFEMALE > ... 
is trying watch the Texas Tech game and read the UFC tweets at the same time ! 
Let's see ... Texas Tech won , Sugar < PROPMALE > Evans won . Is it too much to hope that the Packers will win , too ? 
I have gotten so much writing done . Yay ! 
Last day of dress rehearsals ! What a great cast and crew ! I'm so glad we all got to work together . Love my theater family !

Hugs to the Rainmaker cast for their great work ! Enjoy your day off ! ( But study your lines ! ) See you next Tuesday ! 
Just got an appointment from the American Legion National Commander . How'd THAT happen ?! 
Internet woes .... ARGH !

Went to the TCU game and dinner at Haufbrau Steaks with my hubby . What a great day ! 
Christmas . Not feelin ' it . 
Ok -- snow helps with the whole Christmas thing . 
Buckled down and decorated for Christmas . That wasn't so bad and is even making me feel a little Christmas-y . 
Making golabki and potato pancakes for dinner . Then Monday Night Football ! 
Looking forward to the Army/Navy Game . ( Go Navy -- beat Army ! ) 
Yay Navy ! Bravo Zulu ! 
Wrapped ! ( I know you can't see it , but I'm standing kinda like those guys that hogtie the calf at a rodeo . )

Woooooo TCU ! 
Nude . Color , not state of undressed . 
Howdy , F/V friends ! I need seven more friends to help me raise my barn . Please go to my profile < PROPFEMALE > and help me out ! Thanks and Happy Farming ! 
I believe he did not want to bring that dark presence directly into our house . 
I did the Macarena with a mobile phone in a hole because I'm NOT crazy .

Football all weekend . I <3 football all weekend . 
Ugh -- looks like the Cowboys are gonna blow my average . 
Phew . My powers of pigskin prognostication have plainly petered out . What a putz . 
Off to the grocery store ! 
FarmVille tells me I am out of neightbors invites . Send one to me if we are not already neighbors ! 
mmmm .... nutella . 
Today's game ..... MIDDLE NAME ONLY . Everyone please play this game ! You will find it interesting to know what your FB friends middle name is . Copy and paste this on your profile put your middle name at the end of this sentence ......... Shannon 
Ya know , its the little things that make you realize how old you're getting . Like when your insurance company sends you a special bumper decal celebrating the fact that they've covered you for 25 years . And you realize they only started their coverage AFTER you got married . 
Hmm ... a season ending interception . Where have I seen THAT before ? 
I don't look like anyone . * sigh * 
Braved the torrential downpour to bring up firewood . Even my dog wouldn't stay down at the pile with me ! She ran back up to the back porch to \supervise\ " from a dry spot . But a cup of tea and a crackling fire should put everything right . " 
So I had to put all my wet stuff back on and brave the rain again . The creek has risen so high the bridge to my deer feeder was floating away ! LOL . You should have seen me in my husband's barn jacket and my nephew's rubber boots dragging lumber up the hill ! * sigh * Good times . 
Walkin ' in the woods with my faithful compadre < PROPFEMALE > . Nice . 
To paraphrase Gen . Patton : \You deserve what you tolerate . \ " Something to remember about the leadership we find ourselves under at all levels . " 
What was the #1 song the day you were born ? ( Google it , then post it as your status ) ... Mine is : Easier Said Than Done by the Essex . Interestingly , they were active duty Marines at the time . 
Honoring brother/sister week . By stealing my brother's picture to use ! ( yeah -- I didn't even ask ! ) Love you , < PROPMALE > ! 
Hey F/V neighbors ! I am in need of 1 horseshoe , 4 nails and 2 boards if anyone has the inclination to help a gal out . Thanks and happy farming ! 
F/V neighbors : I need 1 nail and two boards for my stable . Thanks ! 
Good morning F/V friends ! I still need 1 board to complete my stable . Thanks ! 
Yay Super Bowl ! 
You may not care about our farm , our fish , our park and our mafia but what about our cafe , our pet , our island or our vampires ? 
Happy < PROPFIRST>'s Day ! Hope it is filled with people you love . 
I still need help on my coop ! Thanks ! 
Thank for the heart , < PROPFEMALE > ! It wouldn't publish . 
And now ... back to ironing . You wish you were me , don't you ? 
Allow me to \vaguebook\ " a moment : I knew it ! Lol-ing my head off ! "

The Olympics give me hope . I love that for a few weeks every couple of years we can gather together and cheer on the best athletes of all nations . Sure we all wave our own flag and hope for victory but , in the end , they all win our hearts by their courage and amazing spirit . Thanks for the great time , Canada . Thanks for everything , athletes . 
Closing ceremonies .... sniff . Well , at least I'll get to go to bed at a reasonable hour this week ! 
Sooooo ..... tired . 
has to officiate the funeral for the wife of a friend today . :( 
Tickets to Phantom tonight ! 
Me . The Mother of the Bride in less than two months . Wow ! 
Outside my front window , a pair of Red Shouldered Hawks are diligently feeding their new little baby who hatched this morning . I love my home . 
First day of Spring . It's snowing . In TEXAS . 
Took care of the caterer , cake and dress today . She's going to be a beautiful brinde ! 
Ok--she's going to be a beautiful bride ! 
Weeding . Again . Or still , I guess . 
I'm thinking of starting a Contra-gossip movement . Instead of saying mean things behind people's backs , what if we said nice things to people's faces ? And meant them . What a wonderful world it would be . Anyone interested ? 
needs to go take a shower and wash off the gardening stink ! Whew ! 
So far , the FV fix isn't working for me . I've lost two bonus packs . 
I'm having the worst time with Farmville today . But I did just start a Town Greening job and would love for you to join . Thanks ! 
Spring in north Texas ! Love the wildflowers <3 
Dear April- Could you please not pass by so quickly . I have a lot to get done . Thanks . 
Made it through the wedding weekend . Had a blast with the family and really enjoyed seeing all the cousins together laughin ' and carryin ' on . Now to shovel out the house ... 
Sore . 
Got a summons for jury duty . Chances of being seated = 0 . 
Just learned that a Slip-N-Slide makes a great tanning bed ! 
There's sleeping dogs in my yard . I'm gonna let ' em lie . 
What a great workout ! ( But I sure do stink ! ) 
Ugh . I accidentally glutenized myself last night . 
Is it just me or has this year really been challenging ? 
Headin ' to Coppell to spend some time with da nieces ! Yay ! 
The higher a moneky climbs a tree , the more people can see his a@@ . \

What should I be when I grow up ? Hmmm ... 
Did anyone see who won on Hell's Kitchen ? 
Thanks to all my great friends for the amazing support and love in this yucky time . I really appreciate all of you . 
Stressed out + work out = chilled out . \ 
If this keeps up I'll be back to my fightin ' weight . 
Wishing I was with my lovely son , < PROPFIRST > . Prayin ' for you , sweetheart . 
Surgery has started ... 
After many false starts the surgery has officially begun . Start the clock ... 
Surgery was a success ! He's in recovery ! Love to all who held us so close in this time ! 
Hey everyone ! Just wanted to let you know that < PROPFIRST > is awake and thinks his vision already better . He's doing well enough that they'll probably move him out of ICU today . Thanks for your continued prayers and support . <3 
Pathology on the tumor is back : it's benign . Hooray ! Now we can all breathe again ... 
I loves me some kettlebell workout . I'm just sayin ' . 
Just heard a sportscaster say Romo and the rest of the offense weren't on the same < PROPFEMALE > . Same < PROPFEMALE > ?! They weren't even reading the same book ! 
Homemade from scratch cajon style red beans and rice . My nose is running but it is sooo worth it ! 
I miss my kids . :( 
1.4 inches of rain last night . Thunder so loud it shook the house and so much lightening you could see color . Now that's a Texas style storm ! 
Steaks on the bar-b-que and West < PROPFEMALE > v . < PROPFIRST > game on the tv . Life is gooood . 
Today is a tense day in-country for our troops . Let's pray the cooler , more rational heads prevail around the world . 
Ahhh < PROPFIRST > Berman ... I have missed you ! 
An ugly win for the Pack and I don't really get the 4th quarter play calling . I am a solid < PROPMALE > matthews fan , however , and a \w\ " is a \ " w\ " . We'll take it . " 
How ' bout them Texans ?! Pretty impressive . Think I'll be watching them more often ... 
Thinkin ' of making some of < PROPFEMALE>'s Chupacabra margaritas for the Texas v . Texas Tech game . That way whoever wins , I'll be happy . 
I'm going to Legion College in Indianapolis ! Yay ! 
My hot water heater is leaking . Again . :( 
In general , I am an optimistic person . But this year is getting on my last nerve . 
2 days of scraping , power washing and painting the back porch woodwork . I burned myself on the power washer motor and missed football . We're still not done . Stupid homeowner chores . :( 
J-E-T-S , Jets-Jets-Jets ! ( Yes , I AM a betrayed Packer fan ! ) 
Thank you Sanchez , Cromartie and L.T. for making my Monday night ! BTW : how amazing WAS Cromartie ? The guy was bump-and-run on Moss all night long ! ) 
You know what would make baseball more exciting to watch ? Only 4 innings , a carnivorous predator and 2 ex-wives loose on the field . Now THAT would be fun . 
< PROPMALE > is doing wasp abatement wearing his big barn coat , leather gloves , knit cap , goggles and a towel wrapped around his ears . He's using a can of wasp killer . And a raquetball racket . LOL 
I will not get this cold ... I will not get this cold ... 
Heading to Indy in the morning . I am a stupid amount of excited . 
Smokin ' A-Rod for the third out in the ninth ? Priceless . 
Flight tomorrow . I guess I should cut the celebration short and go to bed ... 
Woooo Texas ! 
Monster sleep-in . Whew ! I needed that . 
What do you call 47 millionaires crowded around a tv watching the Super Bowl ? \ 
\ 
The < PROPFIRST > Cowboys . 
Go Steelers ! My brother needs one of his teams to win . ;) 
Happy Birthday to all my Marines ! 
Every once in a while I have one of those resentful days where I hate having to be gluten-free . This is one of those days . 
Well , I'm off .... Vet's Day Parade in Fort Worth , Thank You Pep Rally at the High School . Cap hair for the rest of the day ! LOL 
Christmas commercials .... I am so not ready . 
Helping get my retail friends through the season one pitcher of margaritas at a time . ;) 
Another beautiful fall day ! 
Yay A & M ! Way to beat Nebraska ! 
Really Fox ? Really ? One of the most storied rivalries in the NFL . The drama of Farve meeting his former team for the last time ( probably . with < PROPFIRST > you never know ) and you elect to show the snooze-fest that will be < PROPFIRST > v . Detriot ?! 
Will < PROPFIRST > hire < PROPMALE > Childress ? He kinda likes the pushovers ... 
Happy Thanksgiving , my friends ! May your turkey be moist , your company < PROPFEMALE > and the dishes someone else's chore ! <3 
Trying to decide if I should go to my 30th High School Reunion .... 
Wild turkeys in my front yard . I love Texas . 
I think I've lost my Christmas decorating mojo .... 
Go Navy ! Beat Army ! 
The Expendables + RockNRolla + < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim vs . The World = Fun ! 
GSP defeats Kos . Life is good . 
We're proud of you , Guyer High School , even though you didn't win . You played great and left it all on the field . ( Football is kinda HUGE here in Texas . Folks camp out overnight for season tickets . For High School games . LOL ! ) 
They're remaking True Grit ?! Have they no respect ? 
The Packers need the Bears to lose . This means I have to root for the Vikings . I am conflicted ... LOL 
Despicable Me was great ! Even better than I thought it would be . 
C'mon Navy -- beat San < PROPMALE > State ! 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas ! I hope you are surrounded by people who love you . 
Oral surgery tomorrow . Started pre-meds tonight .... feelin ' groovy . 
If you HAVE to have oral surgery , this is the way to do it . I have almost no swelling and didn't have to take any pain meds in the night . Thanks Dr. Farmer for doing such a great job and thanks < PROPMALE > for the good nursing ! 
Eating . Real food . Go me ! 
Hey my friends-Here's wishing you a beautiful New Year . May your health be robust , your wealth be abundant and your friends be true . 
Can we please stop seeing holiday car commercials now ? Pleeeease ? 
Goin ' to < PROPFEMALE > Hall tonight to hear Seamus Stout play . Good times ... 
You aren't going to believe this . My fridge has died ... again . * sigh *

The hawks are back , repairing the nest from last year . Maybe we'll get to watch another fledgling grow . awwwwwww ! 
Beware the folks that gossip to you . They will gossip about you . \ 
Just sayin ' . 
Thinking about getting my YogaFit teaching certificate ... \ 
Any thoughts ? 
Hey ! I thought I'd drop you a line to tell you how much I enjoyed you bringing your obviously sick and , therefore , very cranky baby shopping with you to WalMart today . Your ability to ignore the lava flow of mucus , wet cough and piteous wailing while casually flipping through EVERY item on the clearance rack was remarkable . I only wish I'd had those skills . 
Go placidly amid the noise and haste , \ 
and remember what peace there may be in silence . \ 
As far as possible without surrender\ 
be on good terms with all persons ... \ 
... With all its sham , drudgery , and broken dreams , \ 
it is still a beautiful world . \ 
Be cheerful . \ 
Strive to be happy . ~ < PROPMALE > Ehrmann's \Desiderate \"" 
Celebrating < PROPFEMALE>'s college graduation today . Where did the time go .... 
Great night , great friends . Now I'm ready for some great sleep ! Good night ! 
Has anyone seen that commercial for \pajama jeans\ " ? I want to know in what universe are those the hot new fashion sensation ?! " 
Not Libya ... 
AH-CHOO !!!! ........? (-???•?) ?....... If you're allergic to bullcrap , drama queens , head games , liars , and 2 faced gossipy people , keep this sneeze going ... I can't wait to see who'll re-post\ 
... and y'all know I rarely re-post . 
I wonder what would happen if we all committed to being the noblest expression of ourselves every day for a week ? Would it catch on ? Imagine if we could stop all the petty things , like hurtful gossip . Wouldn't it trickle up to the big things ? 
one day i'm going to make a differencce people will quote me you'll see\ 
~ < PROPFIRST > Nail . 
Got an amazing haircut by the talented < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > today ! Looking for a great stylist in the Azle area ? She's your gal ! 
Worked at Texas Motors Speedway all weekend . They got a new gal in charge of the VIP parties . She had no idea what she was doing . To say it was a cluster doesn't begin to touch it . I'm staring at the TV today .... 
Looking to upgrade to a smart phone . We're currently with At&T but I see where they don't offer unlimited data . Who do you use/recommend ? 
Yoga with most of my gals . How I love it ! 
Our fridge is out again . 3rd time since December . And we just bought a new washer/dryer . Appliance fail . 
Yay for yoga ! Broken fridge stress is gone , had some laughs with my girlfriends and then they helped me water the veggie garden . We're living out of coolers but life is still good ... 
LOL . Sushi Cat .... 
I'm not going on a diet . I'm adding calories to my excluded food intake . \ 
~ < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > 
My garden really needs the rain but I'm afraid this pounding isn't really going to help my tomatoes ... 
Gettin ' ready for yoga with my gals . Will you be there ? 
I wish other commercials would stop trying to be like Old Spice . They fail and are embarrassing themselves .
