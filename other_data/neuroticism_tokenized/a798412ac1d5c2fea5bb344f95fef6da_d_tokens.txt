Today has been a very strange day .... my Mom called me a Seminary Ninja Master (?) and I realized that I'm pretty much living life parallel to my Uncle < PROPMALE > .... weird . That's all I have to say about this . 
Are anonymous Valentines supposed to be romantic ? Because I got one today , and I'm halfway thinking it's creepy , and halfway thinking it's chicken . ( Who tells someone they like them without even telling said someone who in the heck they even are ? For some reason , that seems cowardly to me . ) 
I hope life isn't just one big joke , because I don't get it . -- < PROPFIRST > Handey
