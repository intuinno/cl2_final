< PROPFEMALE > has the greatest things 
i had no problems today 
so im a champ\ 
i could survive 45 seconds in a ring with a pissed off < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > 
Personally I was overcome with joy that we had completed our adventure . Our new found motivation carried us the rest of the way home . I am now at peace with my weekend . 
With pain , low morale , and no more food and very little water we thought our journey to be at an end . With one last push we decided to advance just a little more . God had seen this and admired our bravery . He rewarded us with clear skies and a welcoming breeze . 
I almost died today . God had shown many signs to say our quest was not to be completed . We ignored them . He sent his lighting to rain fire from the heavens . We were not fazed . Stinging acid rain poured down . We were slowed but trudged on . 
your welcome for my greatly true story 
today ended with a celebration . lights and explosions were involved . 
my tale is now avaliable world wide for no more than $19.95 
Wow my family sucks to be around 
this really scary < PROPFEMALE > vet just came to my house im might cry from fear of his life 
Apparently < PROPFIRST > garcia doesnt love me 
theres a < PROPMALE > im gonna get to pet a lion ! 
i love people who refuse to wait to tell you a story even though your on the phone 
offically a memember of the flat earth society 
apparently < PROPFIRST > EVANS LOVES DRAGON FORCE , DISTURBED , AND HOLLYWOOD UNDEAD !!!!!!!!!!! does anybody else feel like disowning him ? 
so < PROPFIRST > evans and I are now lumberjacks :| 
so im building a raft 
down to your soul - Right away , Great captain . \ 
new favorite song 
i love getting yelled at just for being there 
i still enjoy the waterpark at twin hills very much 
Im pissed 
Anybody else wish they could go anywhere but home everyday 
so according to bonequisheante ' my black name is J-kwon 
Fml 
Its great to know everything about nothing 
So i guess from what im being told right i am a complete waste of skin and a douchebag to everybody i meet 
Ive been told many times today that my hair is great . I would have to agree . 
Ugh boring day . Text me . 
uuughhh i have to go to lowes tommorow for a few saws and an unnecessary amount of rope for the raft :/ 
so i ignored my warning about not eating anything with green apple soda . never again . 
so ive got a great movie to watch this weekend 
Ugh greatest dream ever . 
Wow i watched a great movie . Its over and now im of course theres nothing to do but leave 
Ive been inspired 
so on todays adventure i found some very odd , used , and out of place items 
i cant stand people that only help to get something better for themselves !!! 
0Why live a perfect life filled with nothing but your own self centered complaints and misery . When everything around you couldnt be better you still tend 
0 to find the worst in things . 
The person that complains of being miserable simply has no < PROPFEMALE > to be happy . 
people better ready for some akward hellos tommorow 
\Surely all Americans have the right to give their money only to those causes which they support . But what kind of society has this created ? A society where the ignorant reign . A society where enlightened must hold their tongues . A nation whose politicians must profess half-hearted devotion to an ancient fable or face the disastrous consequences of speaking their true mind . \ " < PROPFIRST > McCandless " 
this guy has changed my view on life . 
Sooooooooooo Fantastic Mr. Fox . \ 
one of the funniest movies this guy has seen . 
if you get a random text . its from me 
You are wrong if you think that the joy of life comes principally from the joy of human relationships . God's place is all around us , it is in everything and in anything we can experience . People just need to change the way they look at things . -\ 
< PROPFIRST > McCandless ( a hero ) 
so im enjoying making akward conversations today 
Chillin with < PROPFIRST > evans . I love this guy 
So i have been forced to apple bees to listen to my mom complain about me , the birthday dinner were having FOR her and its HER idea . Fun night . 
somebody might have to die ! 
alright so far were good nevermind false alarm 
Today belongs to a true hero , a champion , a life long friend ... \ 
My Hair\ 
with a majestic roar , a beautiful show of power , and the will to surrivive my hair has foughten off invaders , demonic blades from hell , and Satans Persuasion . Even though they flee from this Brutal defeat , me and my mane know they will return for another glorious battle of the ages . 
well after this enchanting war i am battle torn and tired i must recooperate for when hells gates open yet again 
here i am eating my ice cream minding my own bussiness when all of a sudden i felt something not icecream like in my mouth . to my surprize i found a ball of metal . assassination attempt ? i think so .

I am standing in the hall of heros . It is in no way a hallway but ive shaken the hand of every vet in there 
ive got no new info on mr. brookes . does anybody know if he's still kicking ?

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH what a scary/great day . i was attacked by moby < PROPMALE > the great white whale but saved by indiana jones . what a hero

Why are so many americans so ignorant .

The most peaceful mind set i have ever had . I have a feeling this might last a while 
I am talking to a supertramp . His story is bringing me to tears ! 
There is a pleasure in the pathless woods ; / There is a rapture on the lonely shore ; / There is society , where none intrudes , / By the deep sea , and music in its roar ; / I love not man the less , but Nature more ... / \

Sadly after a brutal and bloody battle in the freshmen wing we had lost the majority of our troops . We regrouped in Disharoon’s room where we decided to hold off for reinforcements but to no avail .

sitting in my house ... again . :| \ 
i havnt been on an adventure other than my solo treks in almost 3 weeks . 
likes wandering through a swamp and finding a snake , climbing over a < PROPMALE > fence , finding a random campsite and a road to home . I had a good adventure today . 
great to be home . 
What's more fun then a high black man telling you how great your hair is at 9:30 at a < PROPMALE > Thumb ? \ 
Saturday school . 
I saw this black man again today . He wasnt high and didnt remember me . 
Im all healed up from friday mornings fight with the vending machine . 
who wants to do something ? 
relaxing day . 
Annoy people with a vuvuzela ? Yes . Yes i will . 
small jar of horse radish ? 2 dollars if i can get it down in ten seconds ? NO SPOON ? ITS ON !!!!!!!! 
nothing like some < PROPMALE > cake followed by chasing a dog around the house for an hour 
ADVENTURE !!!!!!!! tommorow if Im lucky . Hopefully we come back with some battle scars . 
Apparently ... I need to start looking for a career . Adventures , and fun are for children . My childish games need to stop now . \ 
Pshhh . Tommorows adventure is happening . 
JUST PICKED UP A PIG !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
The lack of adventure right now is killing me . 
I read somewhere how important it is in lifenot necessarily to be strong ... but to feel strong . To measure yourself at least once . 
so im getting an accordion . 
discovered sooooooooooooo many new things today . Im proud of myself . 
OH MAN !!!!! I had the most intense dream that could involve slipping on a wet floor at burger < PROPMALE > . 
Im home . Thank god i wasnt attacked by that rabid kangaroo that is destroying the neighborhood . :| 
ASLAN is sooooooooooooo beautiful . 
This rabid kangaroo took out a tree at the front of the neighborhood . A small child is one thing , but a tree is where you cross the line . Im gonna need the whole clan for this one . We cant let this go on . 
Almost got lost in the creepest place today . Thank god we found a trail that looped back to the road . 
wow . fb is really annoying . 
I need $110 B| time to start looking for work . 
Changing my language to pirate has made everything more intense . 
facebook official . someone is creepin on me . 
Babysit ? Oh yeah . 
No when\ 
No want\ 
No worry 
Why does facebook will post random things for me all the time ? 
Bad news . My spies have informed me that < PROPMALE > plans to attack < PROPFEMALE > estates from the sea . 
I think the biggest accomplishment I've had in the last few days was beating minesweeper on expert . 
soooooooo disapointed 
The stories of today will be so great . 
WE ARE NOT TO BE DEFEATED !!!! 
My body is refuses to cooperate with me right now . 
So . It snowed a bit . 
Oh man ! Got the coolest stuff that goodwill had to offer . 
oh yeah -___- 
So my day was spent in a tree with < PROPFIRST > Evans trying to the fend off a pack of unknown beast on the the afirican plains . 
so im getting a sailors cap 
I return to you bruised , bloody , and tired . We took a powerful blow to our hearts and souls today . From < PROPFEMALE > to dusk we charged this foul demon , but each time we were flung back with a shocking blast of force . The battle was lost as the sun fell , we accepted our losses and retreated to the safty of our < PROPFEMALE > city . Tommorow though , is a new day , and a new battle . 
sailor caps ? yes . \ 
next step is to find a sea worthy vessel 
no school for this man tommorow 
Its official . Imma a cap'n :{ D 
I read somewhere ... how important it is in life not necessarily to be strong ... but to feel strong . 
I just remembered how much i love < PROPMALE > hull 
I guess im starting personal fittness online today 
The greatest find ever !!!!!!! 
I love how the best adventures are never planned . 
Has anybody heard of \Texiy\ " ? I suspect that its an old milk brand . " 
Wants people to comment on this status about how you met me . But , I want you to lie . That's right . Just make stuff up . After you comment , copy this to your status so I can do the same . 
Goin to Spicy Browns ! 
So we just emptied out half a trailer to get to a microphone that wasnt there . 
Forgot to mention we broke into the trailer . 
Oh yeah . Home just where i want be :/ 
So were cold , lost , Bare foot , Not so hungry , and we think were being hunted by a creepy dude . 
The most awkward ending to an adventure yet 
So my feet are bleeding 
And brave heros set off for the unknown . 
Yuuuupp 
Just wrote up Mr. Driver ... Yeah ? Whats up ? 
Got a tomahawk 
-__________- 
Back to being a solo adventurer ? I guess so . 
Mr. Centipede is great 
So my parents think < PROPFIRST > Evans and I get drunk in the woods every < PROPMALE > we get . 
So i guess i dont have school in the morning , honestly im a little scared 
LET THE 34 HOUR NO SLEEP EXTRAVAGANZA BEGIN !!!!!!

Is anybody going to the track meet tommorow ? At 3ish ? Til 7ish ? 
Another confusing morning ... 
sat around the house with Shai Chavez today ... walking my dogs was really awkward but everything turned out alright ! :{ D 
And so the journey begins .... 
Listening to manchester orchestra drifting down the highway ... 
Just stumbled into the tool headquaters 
 ? «So he enters this hellhole alone facing judgemental glances and crude remarks . Even the group stares cannot deter him . He held strong until the foul wide 
 ? « mouth beast froze his very soul with its constant and terrible scream ! 
I have been invited into a random group of hippies at this hotel . We have been here 10 minutes and i already made friends 
Someone help me out and shoot me a text 
Jacksonville is a scary place ... Its like walmart in city form 
This is a challenge 
Im in a tree .

Well then season kicked off pretty slow this year ... but it will pick up as we climb our way back to the top ! 
I lost a toe nail .... Ouch . 
Success !! 
< PROPFIRST > Beams voice can only be described as < PROPFEMALE > . 
Why would you continue to come to my house even after i tell you how horrible i think you are ? 
I really want to know what that embarrassing photo of spongebob at the christmas party looks like . 
A powerpoint presentation . For personal fitness . A class that is offered to students online . A class that has no meaning . It is completely pointless . 
You have a mini computer smaller than your hand . Stop complaining about it . 
oh yeah getting yelled at . again . my phones gone so yeah . you can text all you want but ya know . its been an hour and a half . not sure what to do . 
If there was ever a time to leave i think it would be pretty soon .... 
maybe even now 
There is a pleasure in the pathless woods ; / There is a rapture on the lonely shore ; / There is society , where none intrudes , / By the deep sea , and music in its roar ; / I love not man the less , but Nature more ... / - Lord < PROPMALE > 
I swear , I swear I'll go ... Lead me into my home ... Don't stop , don't ever go .. I swear you'll never know .
