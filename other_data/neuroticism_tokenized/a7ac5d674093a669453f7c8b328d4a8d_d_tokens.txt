I want my boyfriend to email me !! 

i am having fun YAY ! 
i feel like i am a person who needs to get a life sometimes , and at other times , i am the life of the party . 
I need to really learn how to not shy away from doing fun stuff . 
I GOT CONTACTS !!!! 
wish me luck ( and pray ) ... i have all region band try-outs saturday 
good news , and bad news . good news : i got 7th chair in the best band at all region try-outs for flute bad news : < PROPFIRST > fell out of a tree and broke his wrist . pray for him 
i am sick ... sadly 
my new year's is what < PROPFIRST > told me to do- whatever Jesus says , do it 
i am writing an orchestra piece !!! :) 
i don't see how some people can be blind to the obvious ! 
hmm .... pie is really good ... i want some 
I had fun at Shenanigans today ... got 18 pixie sticks ( yum , sugar !!! ) anyway , i enjoyed it , it was my first time ! :) 
I need help ! What does everyone think would be a good ninja symbol ? I need it for my story that I'm working on ! 
i am about to beat bowser in paper < PROPFIRST > for the n64 !!! :D 
I am going to FLORIDA !!! :D TOMORROW !!! 
I HATE WAKING UP EARLY !!!!! 
ATTENTION PIANO NERDS !!! My family is selling a piano for 1200 dollars ! It has really nice sound , and in top condition . Call me at 972-771-5388 if you are interested . 
happy birthday to my mommy !!! 
i can't believe that i'm going to Hawaii in two weeks !!! 
hawaii on saturday !!! i'm incredibly excited !!! don't worry , i'll post a bunch of pictures online 
I'm home ! Hawaii was amazing , and I had a lot of fun . I went hiking , boggie-boarding , and snorkeling . Note to those going to Kauai in the future : the chickens/roosters are ANNOYING ! They wake you up with their cock-a-diddley-doos at 7:00 in the morning !!!! Thankfully all the chickens are only on Kauai so those of you going to different islands are lucky . Still suffering from jet lag ... 
finally ! jeg lag is over !!!! 
finally ! jet lag is over !!! ( ps , for all who have been waiting i FINALLY got my ipod the day before i left for hawaii ) 
oh man ... band camp is fun but hard !!! 
marching is easy , playing is easy , but getting to your spot in the right amount of time and playing is NOT always easy . 
woohoo marching band's first preformance is tomorrow and i don't feel like going . 
white collar is the best tv show ever !!!! 
working on something that i should've been working on a long time ago 
i have c lunch- darn it ! 
i am so tired 
i found out that my mom is on my bus for chaperoning :O hope she doesn't embarress me . and to say so- sry to anyone who gets embarressed 
finally done with chores . i hate labor day . my mom takes it to mean labor all day . 
i hate it when people try to tell you what you can and cannot do with your boyfriend/girlfriend . like kissing , for example . people will do that on their own time , not when others say when it's time . 
i hate school . it's stupid . there is no reason for teachers to assign needless homework that isn't even going to be turned in but you have to do it or else . ooh if i could rule the world i would stop needles homework . 
ok so i went to Cici's with the band last night after the game and my mom got mad at me and < PROPFIRST > Smetana for getting home at 11:50 and is now threatening not even to let me ride the bus home and just take me home from the game . parents can be so annoying . 
wow- staying up late working on hw is NOT my forte ... time to sleeeeeeeeeeeeeep ............ zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ............ 
my gosh white collar is amazing !!! 
wow i'm watching the finale of covert affairs- < PROPMALE > is SO overprotective 
omg so my mom and dad left last night around 7:30 to go shopping , and when they came home there was a DOG !!! we named him whiskie , and he is SO cute ! i'll out some pictures up soon 
i am a klutz . there is no doubt about it . i tripped on the freaking GRASS this afternoon during marching band . i guess i have a little bit of an excuse b/c the ground is uneven , but not much . if you think you are klutzier than me , comment and explain b/c i really don't think so b/c i also tripped down the stairs today too . 
can someone explain to me why homework has to be so annoying ???

NASA says there should be about 30 Orionoid ( that's b/c they look like they're coming out of Orion ) meteors falling per hour . sadly won't be as spectacular b/c of full < PROPFEMALE > tonight . 
i am tired and ready to go to bed . it's been a LONG day ... this is not my fortepiano ... ( haha < PROPFEMALE > Smetana did it again , love u sis ! ) goodnight world , see u tomorrow at school ... erg school ...

working on my scrapbook , yay ! finger is burning b/c i was helping mom w/ some heat rub for her shoulder and i forgot to wipe off ..... oops 
ok so apparently jeans with holes that don't even show skin are against dress code . i for one didn't know that , and got sent to ISS until my dad could bring me some other jeans . this day equals the most nerve-racking day in my life b/c i have NEVER even had a detention , let alone an ISS . never ever ever ever going to happen again . EVER ! 
note to everyone ! i want < PROPFEMALE > ! so please give me ur extra < PROPFEMALE > b/c i didn't get to go trick-or-treating ! comment with what u have and i will post what i want 
doesn anyone know which castle is at the beginning of disney movies b/c i have heard before that it's not the real disneyworld castle 
so i am happy b/c my boyfriend , < PROPFIRST > Becker , FINALLY got a facebook ! yay ! and i am ready to eat b/c i am hungry . everyone pray for the people involved in the semi-truck blow-up and their families . 
my door got taken off . just because my room hasn't been clean in over 2 weeks . i have no more privacy . ARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH !
