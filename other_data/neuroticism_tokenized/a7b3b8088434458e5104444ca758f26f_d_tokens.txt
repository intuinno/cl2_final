Watching the music video : Paitence by take that . 
Working all day today(well , almost ) on the farm . 
General conference ! yay ! :) 
Wow General conference was awesome !

I JUST WON 4 TICKETS TO THE KY DERBY !!!!!! :D :D :D 
Let's see who is paying attention .... Every single one of you are on my Friend list as a result of a conscious decision . I am not only glad to count you as friends but also as family !... Let's see who in my Friends list actually pays attention .... Copy and paste this in your status . I will be watching to see who reposts ;) Thank you for caring 
I love chain letters ( or messages or whatever ) :) 
Just got my Popular Mechanics magazine ! :) 
Is listening to \Somebody's watching me\ " by Mysto and Pizzi . :D " 
Just realised that the only reason that I have a facebook is because President Arntz told me I should . lol XD 
Hates Moody Teenage girls ........... lol 
Can't wait till Trek !! :D 
Kindness is the lubricant that decreases the friction of life 
I didn't realize how hard a cow can kick until I was kicked myself ...... ouch . 
Trek was at times hard , sometimes funny , sometimes annoying , sometimes tiring , sometimes so spiritual I almost cried . But Trek was ALWAYS amazing . :) 
I remember when I found out we were moving to KY , I thought : Kentucky ?!........ KENTUCKY ?!...... where's that ?? and all I could remember from school about KY was that they had KFC and horses . Nothing else . I was sooo wrong ! :D 
2 amazing things happened this last week . 1 , my dad is now officially a professor at UK ! :D and 2 , < PROPMALE > bought a Wii . I wonder how next week will be ?................. :) 
Just accidently found out what bleach does to color clothing .......... lol 
Ok , so < PROPFEMALE > wanted me to turn the T.V. to < PROPMALE > Jr. , but when I did , it pulled up some Muslim Stations !..... what is this world coming to ?......... 
I'M A EAGLE !!!!!! WHOOHOO !!!! XD ( if anybody's wondering what I mean , I'm a Eagle Scout now . ) 
i GOT STARCRAFT 2 TO WORK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 1 ( FINALLY !!! ) THIS IS THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE !!!!!! :DDDDD :P 
Making my lesson for home-teaching now ..... which means I probably should get off facebook now ....... XD 
I have at least 5 people in my chat menu right now that I have NO IDEA who they are ! Haha 
Today was really good . I got to give a talk , and the new New < PROPFEMALE > just came in so it's kool :) 
Family is getting here in a couple of hours from TX :) 
Watching \The Fiddler On The Roof\ " :D " 
Church was really good :) President Arntz was there so we behaved XP 
< PROPFEMALE > just called me a \Double Bumpkin-Pumpkin Head ! \ " is this a bad thing ? XP hahahaha " 
Accidently took a nap with my contacts on ....... it's ...... uncomfortable . :P 
Is anyone going to the Equestrian games tommorow ? I'm going so I was wondering if there was anybody I could < PROPFEMALE > out with . 
It's a funny world ..... but not a hilarious world ...... unless you like sick humor ;P 
So I wanted to learn how to skydive . Then my mom told me I should just go play \chicken\ " in the road instead since \ " It would be a much cheaper way to toy with death I'm sure\ " lol . " 
Is it just me , or is each and every General Conference getting better and better ? Maybe I'm just paying more attention as I get older XD 
Who's going on the campout this friday ?? :) 
I always find it amusing but also sad when a teenager says something like : \My parents and siblings always embaresse me in front of my Girlfriend/Boyfriend ! \ " \ 
\True humilty is not thinking less of yourself 
I'm really glad that I'm not into fashion and such . I would hate to have depend on other people's opinion for emotional security . 
So today after church during seminary , we watched a wonderful movie about < PROPFIRST > Smith . I believe it just came out . The church did a awesome job ! 
Ok so at the end the dance on the 30th President Arntz wanted me to lead a dance contest . It can be any kind of dance ( that's clean at least :D ) on the stage . We'll take turns and then everybody will vote on the best one . The winning team gets a giant chocolate bar :D ( BTW just tell the Pres . which song to play and he will play it when it's your turn ) 
I think < PROPFEMALE > should learn to use God not as a last resort , but as a continual source of guidance . Anybody agree ? 
A man of courage is also full of faith . \

So I always thought < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > was OK ... ( I mean , he is BUFF and all :P ) But then I found out that he was politically right-minded . < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > IS SUDDENLY AWESOME TO ME ! :D 
Ok , so I was watching the Trek video again and after a while I noticed one stunning thing : How did almost half the girls have gum ?? LOL 
I found some old pictures of a dance in Louisville and the person that took the pictures didn't know me . They HAD to tag me as something and can you guess what ? < PROPMALE > Jonas ......... lol XD

Had an awesome time at the priest/laurel activity :) If I took one thing away from it , it would be ....... I shouldn't be a cook when I grow up :P 
I love how it's pretty much tradition for all the guys to scream like little girls whenever \Party in the USA\ " comes on at the dances ..... :D " 
Praying for no snow . :) 
\Yes sir 
Hey all , just so you know there is a Bi-stake dance tomorrow at the Sir < PROPMALE > building . It starts and 7:00 and dress is nice casual . This is the best dance of the year so everybody better be there !! 
You know what's so amazing about Mormon dances ? First of all , we have an AWESOME time . :D \ 
Second , we can ACTUALLY remember the whole dance ( unlike those parties where they wake up and they're like ..... \what happened yesterday ...... ugh I fell terrible\ " :P ) . \ 
Do I have a girlfriend on Valentines day ? Nope ..... INSTEAD , I have like a million pretty awesome friends that happen to be girls :D That's way better in my opinion ;) 
I've been sick since Tuesday morning ...... This is the first time I've ever been sick twice in a year ..... AND I BLAME < PROPFIRST > Nickell COMPLETELY !!! ;) jk < PROPFIRST > 
Hey everybody , \ 
If you posted on my wall or sent me a message in the last week and a half but I'm just now replying , it's because I haven't been on Facebook barely at all . So don't be offended :P 
We have done what you have required of us Dr. X . We are awaiting further instructions . :) 
I'm finally getting used to typing in Hebrew :P ?????? ??????? ...... oh wait ...... now it's backwards ..... DANGIT !!! hahahaha 
??? ?? ??? ! :D 
I love how I have friends with as high standards as me ! I don't have to worry about anything bad happening at parties with them . How awesome is that ? ( and rare ! ) 
I don't know where I would be without God in my life . I shudder to think about it . It's interesting that so many people fear death more than anything else . With God , I look forward to that day :) ( almost sounds grim , huh ? ) 
You . \ 
Ya you . \ 
The beautiful young woman I will one day marry for all time and eternity . \ 
You know , I'm preparing to marry you NOW . \ 
How , you may ask ? \ 
Simply by being the best I can be . \ 
Will you do the same ? \ 
Thanks ! 
Sadie : \That's Jessiah's house ??? I'm gonna marry that boy . \ " :D " 
Wards of Tates Creek and Bluegrass ..... let it be known :\ 
The little < PROPFEMALE > branch of < PROPFEMALE > will outnumber you at volleyball this Saturday ! \ 
< PROPFIRST > my words ! Do your worst , but it's inevitable ! :D 
People in Lexington : ....... I'M COMING !!!!!!! :D 
Hey did anybody see that \Friends of Scouting\ " brochure thingy today ? Just wondering :D " 
AHHHH !!! They changed it so that all you have to do is click \enter\ " to post stuff ...... how annoying :P " 
I think the best thing about Seminary Conference was the fact that out of about 300 youth , I could look into any one of their eyes and see either somebody that I knew well , or a smiling youth that I felt would be willing to be my friend . It just felt like a big family :D ( at least to me ) 
Me : \mom 
I am going to cry myself to sleep now ...... 
Sleepover with < PROPMALE > Burgess and < PROPMALE > Sanders ! :D 
Watching General Conference now ! :D \ 
( anybody that is on facebook now should get off and watch the BYU channel now ) lol ;) 
Conference was great ...... but ended way too fast . Good thing there are three more sessions coming right up !! :D \ 
( and an extra one for us guys ) 
Now that I have been edified all day from general conference ....... GO UK !!!!!!!!!!!! :D 
NOOOOOOO !!!!!! D: We lost ........ 
I remember when conference was so slow getting over with ...... it seemed to drag on forever and ever ! \ 
Now , I blink and it's gone ..... :/ 
First general conference .... then wonderful weather outside ... then MORE general conference .... now reading the New Era .... and then Tomorrow is Spring Break ! \ 
* sigh * \ 
HOW MUCH BETTER CAN THINGS GET ? :D
