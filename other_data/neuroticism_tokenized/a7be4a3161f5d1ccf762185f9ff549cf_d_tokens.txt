Hanging out with brother and < PROPFEMALE > . what a bunch of weirdos 
< PROPFIRST > ( July 23  August 22)Great things will come to you if you keep your tongue perfectly still for the next hour . Try something new , like creating a dolphin that is also a monkey . Your socks will betray before the end of the month . For financial success , type a sentence that is only two words long . The sentence cannot be sad at all . Your lucky flavor is raisins . Your lucky mythical creature is a troll . 
i tired to watch a video on youtube and this is what came up\ 
Sorry , something went wrong . \ 
A team of highly trained monkeys has been dispatched to deal with this situation . \ 
If you see them , show them this information : 4P12XIJCHNnE2vzp6relFp7WWdk0snQzWas_Xl1snLT8M3Ww6-cqN3-wMg5Cf9jaU5lwCc6_Zad7SO5zbt2SvPmywdAv
