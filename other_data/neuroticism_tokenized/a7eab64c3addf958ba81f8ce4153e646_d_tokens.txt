I went to Free Comic Book Day today - < PROPMALE > LINE DUDE !!! My dad and I waited in line for almost an hour to get in , half hour to get our free comics , and another hour for me to buy four other comics . At the same time my dad and I won almost thirty other free comics while we were there . The guy that admitted us in thought I was either goth or into the a cult . 
Dude , testing has been so boring , but I guess since we get out early I can live with it . 
I'm tired of just waiting for the storm to pass , I'm going to do something about it and go dance in the rain 
Just when I thought I understood , I realize that I'm as lost as a wandering puppy 
Had a bbq at my moma's house and it was ok , not a lot of cousins showed up so I was a little disappointed :( 
I don't know what to think about him anymore , because everyone is telling me something different 
Well today was just crappy ; the school is so screwed up with all the students wasting their time and everyone else's and now I'm just pissed off at every thing ! 
Stupid clinic visits ... 
Getting a total make-over today : got my eyebrows threaded , my mommy helped put on my complexion mask , and I'm gonna do my hair perrty lawl , \

The eighth grade celebration dance was uuber fun ! And I don't care who says I'm a dumb ass for saying it , it was fun ! XDD 
I can't really sleep , so i'm kinda wandering around the house and listening to the crickets in the backyard 
Three inch high heels were not made with anas in mind XDD 
I went swimming at Contra < PROPFEMALE > and guess what I saw ?? A gopher ... and DUCKS !!!! XDD Inside joke lol 
It's funny because I used to say that people who spend hours on social networking sites seriously had no lives ..... Now I either have no life , or I am putting my foot in my mouth , I haven't decided which , yet ....

I went swimming at my neighbor's house almost all day ; the kids were beating me up in the pool ! XD Oh , these kids wear me out ... 
One thing I hate about summer : I don't know how I do it , but I always manage to sleep all the way through the afternoon XP 
I hate it when I get into a project , and my inspiriation desk is on a roll , and then , just as suddenly as it had begun , my mind is completely blocked from inspiration , and my brain is left to rot as it is being picked at with a blunt scalpel .... 
I hate it when I start a project that will take years to finish , because it would always be like a hammer on my brain every time I think about the project I either need to finish or never finished .... 
My sister asked me if I was ever nice at school , and I tried to think of a time when I used any manners , acted like a lady , and didn't beat someone up or yell at someone ... \ 
I came up with no events of that sort 
On the boat and wishing desperately that I had brought my own computer ... \ 
And learning the hard way that in my family you have to have a big voice to get your say ... Dang my small voice ... 
I hate it when I think out loud when I'm trying to text some one , and my mom thinks I'm talking to her with an attitude .... Most of the time I'm mentally kicking the person I'm texting XD 
I woke up randomly at five this morning and thought I was going to stay up to watch the sun rise , but instead I fell asleep and woke up with the sun beating down on my face at nine ... I'm sure the sun rise was beautiful ... I may never know ... :'( 
Rockin ' in the escalator , moshin ' in the elevator . Shop . Until I Drop . Let's go to the mall , you know they have it all ! 
Going to a block party\ 
Happy 4th of July every one ! XD 
The block party was a-ok ; I didn't exactly have fun , but it wasn't completely boring either\ 
HAPPY 4TH !!! XD 
I was never one for fireworks , I honestly never knew what the point was , but I think it had something to do with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Key's experience in the War of 1812 ... 
I GOT NEW BOOKS AND CDS !!! The Ramones ' Rocket to Russia Cd , and the last Death Note Manga as well as < PROPFIRST > is Undead ( a book about the Beatles as ZOMBIES !!! ) XD It's good to be me ! 
Just spent most of the night teaching my two aunts how to upload photos from their cameras to their computers to their facebooks ! XD And now Auntie < PROPFEMALE > is going to be calling me almost every day from upstate to ask me how to use her computer LOL 
1 . Family - n . ~ the only thing that is both the best damn thing in the world , and the skeletons in your closet ( if only we didn't share the same space as them ) XD 
Came home and found that my grandfather decided to re-decorate the house ! XD The rooms are really pretty and now me and my sis have a bigger room in which to annoy each other ... May the best girl win lol 
Good guys live forever , The evils die faster , And love remains infinite .

Forgiveness is not a trait you are born with , it is a virtue that many have yet to learn . 
What no one seems to understand is that I just want someone to listen ; I hope they'll see what I mean before time runs out , before all is forever lost ... 
Well I'm a smart one : I accidentally reset my stats on Vampire Wars !!! I had an energy stat of 50 and a rage stat of 9 !! So upset ... D: 
I'm getting back into guitar ! I tuned it just now and I am going to start teaching myself Disenchanted by My Chemical Romance ! yay ! :) 
Before we left for lunch , I was searching high and low all morning for my sweater , and when we came back I found it right where I left it : in my sock drawer . XD 
\Why do I hold my breath/ every time you say/ what I think I want you to say ? / Look behind these dew-stained eyes/ And show the world/ all this pain . \""

Watching The Lost Boys . \Like\ " if you think that that movie is a classic ! " 
Teens have cell phones , and they answer them about 96.85% of the time . \

About to go see Clash of the Titans . \ 
It would be totally cooler if we watched the original , and then the newer one . \ 
But alas , we do not have the original ... * sniffle * 
going camping in a few minutes ; can't wait ! ;) 
Got back from camping and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > last night . Had uuber fun ! XD 
Why can't we be friends and put all the heart ache behind us ? Just put it all in the attic , or the basement , whatever you decide ... 
Two more days until I can completely start over ; a clean slate ; erasing the board ; changing my underwear . \ 
0 . o

For those nights when I couldn’t be there , \ 
I’ve made it harder to know that you know , \ 
That somehow , \ 
We’ll keep moving on . \ 
There’s so many wars we fought , \ 
There’s so many things we’re not , \

We’re marching on . \ 
I want to hate this song , but it's just not happening ....

We live with bittersweet memories , because some one has to remember the goodness , even if they won't

Suddenly I realize that I'm all she's got ....

So I'm making up for it by listening to \Leaving on a Jet Plane\ " by < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ^_^ " 
Today is quite an eventful day for me : it's my mommy's birthday today ( Happy Birthday Mommy ! ^_^ ) and it's mine and Kirkland's one month together ! ^_^ Happy day , Happy day ! :D 
Went to the club last night for dinner . Kirkland came with us , and he made me play pool -.- I tried to tell that I can not hold a cue to save my life , but I still ended up playing . Oh well , he accidentally sunk the 8 ball anyway , which ended the game early for me ! ^_^
