A federal district court recently ruled that Don't Ask Don't Tell is unconstitutional . Now the Obama Administration has a choice whether to fight that decision . \ 
If they choose not to fight , the Don't Ask , Don't Tell law could become a relic of the past . That's why I just added my name to a letter from the Human Rights Campaign to Attorney General Holder asking them not to appeal the court decision . Please join me now
