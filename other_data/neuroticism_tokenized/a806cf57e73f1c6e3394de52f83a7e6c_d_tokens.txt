Very sadly , most of you probably won't\ 
copyand paste this . Will you do it and leave it on your status for at\ 
least an hour ? It's Special Education week , and this is in honour of all\ 
the kids who need a little extra help & understanding ? 
While you SCREAM at your woman , there's a \ 
man wishing he could talk softly to her ear ... While you HUMILIATE , \ 
OFFEND and INSULT her , there's a man flirting with her and reminding her\ 
how wonderful she is . While you HURT your woman , there's a man wishing \ 
he could make love to her . While you make your women CRY there's a \ 
... man stealing smiles from her ... Post this on your wall if you're \ 
against Domestic Violence 
We need prayer ... you get great news and think you have everything figured out then something happens to mess everything up .... 
A true friend can go a long time without \ 
speaking and never question their friendship , and pick up like they \ 
just spoke yesterday regardless of how long it has been . REPOST if you \ 
are lucky enough to have at least one .

There comes a time in life when you have to let go of all the pointless\
