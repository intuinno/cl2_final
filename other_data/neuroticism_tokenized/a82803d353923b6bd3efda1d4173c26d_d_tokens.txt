Let'ssee how creative my FACEBOOK friends are . Leave a 1 word comment that you think best describes me using the THIRD LETTER of your FIRST NAME . It can only be 1 word . Then copy and paste this to your wall so I can leave a word about you . Don't just post a word & not copy !!! 
Ever had one of those days where everything that could go wrong did ? I'm just waiting for the bus to hit me now .... XP

The lord certainly has an odd way of doing things ... I pray to him in my confusion about my reluctance to go to church and now I'm heading to the funeral from the wake of my MawMaw Cernich ... Guess I finally got to go to a service after all ...
