I can't believe I'm even using Facebook ... but anyway , I don't know what's on my mind . You can say I'm being whiny about crap but to be honest I have A LOT to legitimately be annoyed about and really , I only have about two people I can talk to about my issues with . It sucks , and sometimes I don't like having to bottle up my feelings , but I can't trust anyone with my words right now . ( To Be Continued ) 

It seems where ever I go , nuisance or trouble follows . I sometimes see it as a blessing rather than a curse , but I really don't care for constant noise . A part of me can't live without the activities I'm doing right now , but another part of me wants to sit down , relax , and have a cup of tea with a dear friend . I scrutinize myself everyday because I can't muster the courage ... ( To Be Continued ) 
... to tell people off when they're hurting me . Do I need to be treated ? No , but sometimes I wonder if I was a Beagle in my past life , being abused by his master everyday but seemingly always going back to him to find love even if he was the most deranged , bitchy , disgusting , pile-of-filth human to ever be born . Yeah , I'm exaggerating , sure , but that's what I feel like . ( To Be Continued ) 
It's sad , but again , I deal with it . Another thing is the fact that I'm in constant teeter with the fact that I'm just welling up with emotion and yet I can't really tell anyone about it because they wouldn't understand and , again , judge me and the way I feel . Yes , I understand that these posts are public and all of you who are friends with me can see them , but I really don't consider you all ... ( To Be Continued ) 
... to understand because what I'm doing right now is not to make a point but vent my frustration to the internet . If I can't bother people in real life , then I'm certainly going to do it here because I know that there will be at least one person who sees this post and really , truly understands what I'm going through . ( To Be Continued ) 
I can also really be honest here , too ; I'm nervous about what tomorrow is going to bring . What is this supposed to mean to you ? Nothing , really , but I'm just going to put it out there that tomorrow might be the most stressful , nail-biting day of my life . Insane , I know , but nevertheless stressful and nail-biting . ( To Be Continued ) 
I guess you could say I'm a complicated soul , yes ? Well , anyway , I whined for the first time in a while . I feel great ! Also , I got a PS3 Slim in the mail as a surprise birthday present . \\o/ Thanks for reading , - Lord Mog 
I want a bag of aquamarine marshmallows now that I think about it ... 
My asshole is burning like a sassy banana . 
I feel as if though I'm going to explode with all of this cuteness that you throw at me . ? 
I'm on goddamn Cloud 9 and I'm only going up . <3 
< PROPMALE > profile overhaul . xD You can now Facebook stalk me and know stuff about me ! Yay !! 
Ugh , so sleepy . x3x Gonna wake up at 5 A.M. again , woohoo ! 
What's on my mind ? Lots of stuff , FB . Thanks for asking . :] I think I should totally crap around with my blog and start posting on it gagagaga . 
Apparently I'm buying The Fame Monster just to say I did . Should be arriving in the mail tomorrow morning . O__O 
Scratch that , Fame Monster will come in on Friday I think . ;-; 
I WANT MY FAME MONSTER RIGHT FUCKING NOW . 
AMG I GOT IT !!! Finally . >:D Amg it's so good lol . <333 
It's official : I'm in a Virgo insomniac week . ;-; Why can't I sleeeeeeepppppppppp . 
Can anyone convince me that I don't want to delete my Facebook < PROPFEMALE > ? Please ? I'm extremely tempted . 
I mean , hell , I never use it anymore and I'm such a goddamn griever lately that I have nothing to post . 
Why has life treated me like this . .___________. 
FRANTIC TICK TICK TICK TICK 
Do I seriously look that angry ? ._. 
I have a Vuvuzela in my ass . 
EARTHQUAKE ! Still have a Vuvuzela in my ass . 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Baker hates @ < PROPFIRST > Cowder . <_< 
< PROPFIRST > Cowder , < PROPFIRST > Hansen tells me through our mind-link that his ship is lagging like balls because your fat is trying to sink it . Your reply ? 
< PROPFIRST > Cowder , I got through to < PROPFIRST > Hansen finally . He says he IS your hard-drive and you're filling it full of nasty obese yeast infections yourself . Your reply ? 
I think Facebook is trying to tell me to stop being a lurker . It continually logs me out and now I'm getting messages from two weeks ago and none of the updates are being alerted on my phone . Oh my god . Does anyone know e-CPR here ? 
< PROPFIRST > Cowder and < PROPFIRST > Hansencar is still OTP . Confetti NOW . 
Sleepless thinking about you . 
How do I live without you ? \ 
Within the sky , only known as you\ 
Trap only me in there 
I swear I got a message update on my phone and it's not even here anymore ... @_@ I'm going crazy . Unless he deleted it . Baah . 
All you sluts made me change my profile picture . 
The shock of what just happened has finally come into play , and now I feel dark . 
DANCE , FUCKER , DANCE ! 
And how long will I have to wait exactly ? 
*** On Skype***\ 
Dounia : Damn , you're just likin ' everything ... \ 
Syk : I know , right ? * Likes comment * 
Upsidedown\ 
Never get enough\ 
Kick it in\ 
Crack the overdrive\ 
Shake it up now\ 
All night long\ 
\ 
Inside out\ 
Turn around\ 
Black on black\ 
Flashback in your brain\ 
Shout out loud ( yeah ) \ 
Shout out loud ( yeah ) 
feels jealous and alone . 
I WISH I COULD TAKE A PICTURE OF MYSELF THAT ISN'T STRANGE . 
Apparently I'm an ISTJ . So is < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Ruhl . Before we were both INTJs , too . WTF . D < 
Sometimes , I want to just copy someone else's status word for word just to see if they would notice .. 
How I feel right now : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpHdPpahvMs 
I feel like I'm going nowhere without you . You're so close and yet too far to see it , I think . Please tell me I'm wrong --- I don't really want to pain myself with doubting and wondering about the what-ifs of us . Please , for me . 
Like my status and I'll tell you : \ 
1 ) Something I've learned about you from looking at your wall for 10 seconds . \ 
2 ) The color you remind me of . \ 
3 ) My first memory of you . \ 
4 ) The animal you remind me of . \ 
5 ) Ask something I've always wondered about you . \ 
6 ) My favorite thing about you . \ 
7 ) Give you a nickname . \ 
8 ) Challenge you to repost this . 
Not a sleeze-bag , that's for sure . 
I think I'm going crazy . 
Feels very lonely right now . : < 
Watching Toy Story 3 . So cute . 
You never get me down , I'm always up with you no matter what you do . 
It seems that people don't know what they have until it stares them in the fucking face . 
If anyone wants to be a twitter whore with me , follow @phantomhivecake . ;D 
I am the happiest person alive . :3 !!!!! 
If I were any happier I might explode . :] 
Okay , done with YouTube . Now onto dreaming about you . :] 
You know you're in love when you eat as much chocolate as I do . x ] 
My Virgo sensibilities are telling me not to , but it is SO TEMPTING . 
The Other Guys is kind of cheering me up LOL . 
I enjoy the idea that I didn't actually wake up to my alarm at 6:00 , I woke up to someone on Twitter at 6:01 with that godawful sound I have set . 
Took a nap for an hour and forty and I feel VERY GOOD . 
These people are not telling me anything that is remotely plausible ... 
I LOVE Oasis . D: 
Is it weird that I have sort of an issue with wearing pants and shirts from the same brand ? o_o ; 
The Green Hornet was AMAZING . 
Panda for dinner eeeep . :3 
Aaaaah , hour and thirty naps . <3 
I think my computer is finally melting down or something . The fated day has arrived . ._. ; 
* pops bottles in the ice ... \ 
... like a blizzard * 
Chicken on a raft on a Monday morning , oh what a terrible sight to see ... \ 
Oh my god what am I doing . 
It's raining out . :D 
Salt has such a cliffhanger ending it's ridiculous . 
I'm very happy this morning . (: 
I don't think I've made so many typos in my life since writing this paper . o_o 
Prompt half-hour naps are so nice sometimes . :P 
I just got out of the car and my entire back cracked . : I 
#nowwatching Resident Evil : Afterlife :D 
She was doing twirls on the wall and dodging bullets . This series has gotten even more insane than I remember . xD 
Wesker this is all your fault . Seriously . 
Potential underwater zombie fights are slightly creepy . 
Okay well that movie ended on a crazy cliffhanger . o_o 
It's actually < PROPFEMALE > out in Washington for once ! x ] 
I AM A NEW FOUND GLEEK . o_o ; 
It is mornings like these that I realize I need to go to bed EARLIER . xD 
* Click , refresh . Click , refresh . Click , click , click , click , click , clickclickclickclickclickclickclick , refresh . * 
It's RAINING . I am going for a WALK . <333 
Time to drown my sorrows in GLEE . 8D\ 
Kind of funny the way that came out . 
Hmm ... I'm getting icecream . :P 
HELLO FACEBOOK HOW ARE YOU FINE THANK YOU I AM CHIYA'S DAD . 
Nothing like a long nap to make up for Saturdays . :P 
Another morning , another gigantic cup of coffee . @_@ 
I'm so done with life right now . -_- 
Don't be a drag , just be a < PROPFEMALE > . * unceunceunceunce * 
I have realized that I do not appreciate others as much as I should . Let me work on this . 
RIFT , you need to get your shit together right now . ._. 
It's the first day of midwinter break and I'm already bored without school what is wrong with me . D: 
I have a really good feeling that my iPhone 4 doesn't work as well as it used to . Should I just say fuck it and get an Android ? I mean good god I don't even get texts like I'm supposed to . 
WHEN THERE IS NOTHING TO DO ... \ 
Nap the time away , I say ! :D 
So Starry Sky , \ 
Let me kiss you , very slowly . \ 
Starry Sky . \ 
I sing for you , I think of you , \ 
I remember when Iost my mind the time when you caught my vibe . \ 
I remember when I moved for you , don't be shy . \ 
So let me kiss you under the Starry Sky . 
CAPSULE IS SO GOOD . \ 
SO GOOOOOOODDDDDD . 
I wish you , because I want all that I wish to come true . \ 
I hope you , even though we might be on different paths . \ 
I think back , I'm always thinking of you . \ 
I wish you , continually , because I'm right by your side . 
FML . 
So I wish you ... 
Is actually getting out . \ 
WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT ? 
I'm sorry for everything . 
Now PANIC and FREAK OUT . :D 
95% of people on my facebook won't read this , but as we speak , Libyan people are being massacred , because they're rebelling against an unfair government . The elderly , women , children , everyone in Libya is in danger tonight . It's genocide . Repost this as your status to raise awareness and support the revoloution . 
I believe homework today is ... MONUMENTAL . * studies with some tea to sip * 
Panda for dinner . Wahahaha . 
Well that snow was temporary . :P 
Well since there's no snow , it's time for a walk in 36 degree weather with a cup of coffee in my left hand while a million different bikers zoom past me . The usual Washington fare . 
Even I don't know if I'm okay anymore . 
2:32 : done with everything . \ 
2:45 : nap . \ 
3:10 : * stir*\ 
4:03 : wakes up and checks Facebook . \ 
Oh yes . :D 
I am strangely enjoying Weeds . Never thought I would say that . 
My god it is COLD outside . ;_; 
Oh my god ... \ 
This is the first time I've been able to sleep into 11 for ages ... o_o 
They say small , and yet the shirt doesn't fit . They can't be serious . 
The < PROPMALE>'s Speech is an incredible movie . 
I feel the heavy need to watch How to Train Your Dragon now . :D 
I didn't realize until I took my shoes off that my new socks make me slide everywhere ... xD aaaah . 
I am certain these socks are aiming to bring me an early death . @_@ 
Finally turned on my computer . xD Let's see what I missed while I was playing Uncharted 2 . 
Out for coffee then going home again to play Uncharted 2 and Skype with DOUNIA RATHBONE if she COMES ONLINE . :D * pokes Dounia * 
MUCH TO STUDY , VERY LITTLE TIME . * starts reading * 
Friday night bowling time . :) 
Bowling was BOMB . OMG . <3333

Naps are glorious . xD 
Uncharted 2 might be one of the best video games ever made . Uncharted 3 here we come . :D 
Uncharted 2 multi-player time . <3 
I feel like all of it is slipping through my fingers and I don't know what to do . :/ 
Gettin ' my dork in with Dragon Age 2 . :) 
Heading to see Adjustment Bureau . :] 
Adjustment Bureau ... was really thought-provoking . Did not expect that . 
Finally got home after shopping . Baking for a project and then hopefully if the power doesn't go out I can actually sit down and check Facebook . :P 
Seriously , this project better work . :| Baking from an old 1600s British cookbook is no easy task . 
FANTASTIC Friday night with mah Korean twins . <333 Most fun I've had in weeks hahaha ! 
Could barely sleep , but when I was able to ... a very weird six-part dream . Very weird ... ._. ; 
DST why must you exist . :D 
I really need to learn how to practically sew in case of my shirt stitching going crazy in the wash . Uggghhhhhhhh . ;_; 
Good morning . 
Even my naps have weird dreams now . ._. ; 
I will forever be THE dork . <3 
Dragon Age is going to take over my entire schedule I swear to gaw . * tries to find homework pile *

My god I have SO MUCH to do this week . \ 
THIS CALLS FOR MORE TEA . * presses glowing teabag button * * teabots run in with freshly brewed pots of tea * 
That awkward moment when you delete your Tumblr due to an influx of stalkers and realize that you wrote THREE CHAPTERS of your original fiction in your draft box . Ffffff . 
I NO LONGER GIVE A FUCK . \ 
AND I FEEL SO GOOD !!! 
It's been a while since I've updated my status . HELLO FACEBOOK .
