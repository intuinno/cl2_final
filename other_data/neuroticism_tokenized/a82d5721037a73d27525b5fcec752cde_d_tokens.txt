Imperfection is beauty . Madness is genius . And it is better to be ridiculous than absolutely stupid . - < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE >

I can not for the life of me figure out how to sync my ipod to my new computer without it deleting all my stuff . help ! 
I hate being told what to do . I wear big girl panties , thanks . 
Sick of this computer screen . 
Red Bull and Gin but feel like vodka ... 
Fever of 101.5 . gonna try to go back to bed ... wish me luck . 
I'd just like to apologize to everyone for being \so fucking annoying . \ " Thanks . " 
still sneezing ! so sick of it . anyway , sorry for being \annoying . \"" 
I posted a note . I hope the right person reads it . I hope they know who they are and I hope it means something to them . 
It's back . 101.2 . :( 
It's official . He is never going to change . 
I have a surprise for a Mr. < PROPFIRST > A . Jeter IV . I'm excited . :) 
Having some wine and watching comedy central . Good times all around . You're missing out . 
I hate valentines day with a passion of ten thousand fiery suns . Never once have I had a good one . This one shall be no different I'm afraid . 
Super excited for tonight ! Just gotta conquer work and school first . But what to wear ? 
Really , really , BAD day . Doubt sleep will even help . :/ 
Manocotti then work . Maybe today will be raise day . 
No raise today . Such a disappointment .. Oh well , at least i clocked out with 13.75 hours . :) Bout time . 
It's funny how the undo button never works in real life . I wish I could live on a keyboard . 
REALLY ?!?! What to do ?? Oh , I dunno , maybe see your girlfriend .?! Funny how it Never crossed his mind . 
Knees are killing me ! 
Me : All guys are , are liars , cheaters , and assholes . \ 
Paul : That's not true ! I'm not an asshole ! \ 
haha . 
Looks like another great night to come at casa de Jeter . :) 
He's all yours ladies . 
Quote me : You had a choice . You chose . You got what you deserve . 
Could really use a backspace button .. 
A&P Lab till 8:20 . super excited . 
Well that's just lovely . Enjoy ! 
This was the biggest waste of time and energy on my record . He should have just told me from the start . I would have been okay then but now , I've not only lost a boyfriend , but a bestfriend as well ... Why all the games ? 
Due date . :) 
It's truely amazing what can happen in just a matter of hours . Believe me , I know . One day can change your life . Imagine what a week could do for the world .. 
Horrible , Terrible , No good , Very bad two weeks . The topping to my sunday : Mom giving my dog away . :( 
Personally I would like to apologize to everyone < PROPFIRST > A . Jeter has been with , relationship or not . He is a liar , cheater , hurtful , ungrateful bastard that thinks only of himself and wants nothing more than a good lay , so ladies , beware for he is on the prowl . I wish you luck . :) 
Generally speaking , I don't think I'm that bad of a person . I do alot for other people and I get along with everyone until they give me reason not to . I'm here for you when you need me , I'll defend you in a heartbeat and I'm as loyal as it gets . So with that said , I have one question . Why does everyone feel the need to use me as their doormat and stab me in the back ? Just letting you know , I'd NEVER do that to you . 
My favorite holiday and I have nothing to do ... 
Drinks on me ... Literally . 
I know curiosity killed the cat , but I'd rather be dead than absolutely stupid . 
\Give me < PROPFEMALE > and I'll marry you too . \ " :) " 
Straight just got attacked and smothered at Pet Smart . 
\Considerable clouds \"" 
\smells like a m&m fucked a skittle \"" 
Instead of being put in his pocket for the weekend , I was surely put in his shoe . He's done nothing but walk all over me . 
Hot tea to start my day . :) 
Finally off from Zaxby's now to Quiznos . :) 
Bored already .. 
Home sweet home . 
Please don't call me , you didn't all weekend . Please don't ask if I'm alive , I didn't know if you were . Please don't tell me you're sorry , I've heard it enough . Please don't act like this time would have been any different , it's always the same . Please don't pretend like you're hurt , I know I don't phase you . 
Working 11 hours today . Super excited .. 
So , He really didn't do anything huh ? Wow .. He seizes to amaze me . 
Wish I could speak and understand spanish . It would make this class SO much easier . 
I love my flowers . I smell them as I fall asleep and as soon as I wake . Thank you ... 
I wish I was still a believer ..
