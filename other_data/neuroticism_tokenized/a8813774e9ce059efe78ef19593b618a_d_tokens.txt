I would just like to do the duty or telling everyone to NOT .. I repeat NOT join Gold's Gym .. They tell you one thing then do another . Good luck if you ever have to cancel a contract with them . And if you do make sure you get everything in writing . Just a heads up . So obviously I STRONGLY suggest not to join Golds . Unless you like being lied to .

Shame on him : Obama picks Memorial Weekend to go home to Chicago instead of following traditions and speaking at Arlington Cemetery . The President is the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces but HE needs a break on the ONE day we are supposed to remember troops and all they've done . Repost this status if you think our troops are ... worth remembering . I know I sure do .
