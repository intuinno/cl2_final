We are living in the age in which the pursuit of all values other than : money , success , fame , glamor ; has either been discredited or destroyed . Money , success , fame , glamor ... for we are living in the age of the thing . 
It's interesting to me how quick and eager people are at labeling their person : straight , gay , white , black , French , American , etc . The only labels I care about are the ones on my clothes . 
(^^,) 
I can't believe it . . . That was the most difficult attempt ever (-_-)

why is it called a \training bra\ " ? do girls have wheels like a bike and need to learn how to balance their person ? " 
It's kind of sad how we can read words that combine letters , < PROPFIRST > , and symbols -- an all-in-one special . Does correct spelling matter anymore ? I'm sorry but I'm old-school .
