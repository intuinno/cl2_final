shouldn't I be happier that < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > was brought back from the dead ? Cuz for some reason i'm not . ^^ 
oh , scratch that . He did die . Sad . 
Oh , universe . You always have a way of making me angry .

shall never again doubt the marvelous powers of sunscreen ... 
Fireworks -- a nicorette patch for the pyromaniac in all of us .

Panic is splitting in half ... just the thought of it makes me sad ... T_T

is BACK for an entire day before MB camp . Woo . 
woo , back from band camp . And one more day until MORE BAND . Yay . 
only three weeks left until ... a . ) marching band slows down ; b . ) school starts ; c . ) my life goes back to an actual routine ; or d . ) all of the above . 
has the utmost respect for the marching band pit . Hauling the pit cart up that hill is heck . -_- 
back from vacation^^ the American Idol concert rocked my world last night . =) 
Taking everything for granted but we still respect the time - We move along with some new passion knowing everything is fine - And I would wait and watch the hours fall in a hundred separate lines - But I regain repose and wonder how I ended up inside . 
had lots of fun at the baking party , and is now going to go read a BOOK that ISN'T school-related ( omg ! ) 
Summer vacation just wouldn't be the same if I didn't wait for the day before school starts to finish all my homework ... heh heh heh ... -_- 
woo , marching band today ... can't you just SEE the excitement exuding from me ? Hmm ? Well I can't . :) Is ' exuding ' a word ? 
SECOND PLACE !!! Who rocks the world ? We do . That's right . 
is officially a cripple ...... oh my goodness ...... 
learned lots of band jokes today -- What is the difference between a clarinet and an onion ? No one cries when you chop a clarinet into little pieces . 
how did the homecoming game end ? I left too early , I want to know if we won ... 
TWINS FTW . HECK YES !!!!!

had no idea that missing 2 and 1/3 days of school would bring SO MUCH homework into my life . Hmm . 
no one is ever too old for trick-or-treating . There's just an age when it starts to get awkward if you go by yourself ... like , maybe 35 , or 40 . 
oh , the band banquet . Such a bittersweet celebration of the end of marching band ... 
17 days until For Your Entertainment comes out^^ yay < PROPFIRST > Lambert

Symphonic band = the inner INNER circle . 
Kamikaze airplanes in the sky : Are we going down or will we fly ? : This could be a shipwreck on the shore : Or we could sail away forever more : This time , it's sink or swim 
No bass clarinet part = no Jesus Christ Superstar audition ... oh well . Next year , I guess . =(

I love rewriting entire vocab tests by myself for a group of seven people ... lol jk not really . People need to e-mail me . Seriously . By the way , I hate you , tech week . 
I love speaking in Chinese with my little sister ... she never fails to brighten my day =) 
< PROPFIRST > Moore , Gen Lantto , < PROPFEMALE > Parr , < PROPMALE > Jacobs , you guys are the most amazing best friends anyone could ever wish for . I am SO insanely thankful for all of you . =D 
There's no better way to kick off a vacation than by watching un-subtitled Japanese television and The Sound of Music with your family =) 
Belief is a beautiful armor . It makes for the heaviest sword . Like punching underwater , you never can hit who you're trying for .
