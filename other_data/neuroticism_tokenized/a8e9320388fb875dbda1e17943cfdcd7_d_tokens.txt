how come whenever i find someone i really like it has to get fucked up and not work out ? is there something so wrong with me that i cause an amazing person to move far away and probably never see them again ? i dont get why i cant be happy . maybe god just hates me and wants me to be alone .

watching a show about russian male strippers . its actually quite interesting . 
You'd better get used to being judged , cuz its never gonna stop . 
it's a bit unnerving when you realize a commercial you've never payed attention to before is really subliminally telling you that you need to ' trim your bush . ' 
watching a show where a 13 year old japanese school girl with a samurai sword is slaughtering a mob of zombies . life doesn't get any better than this . 
I refuse to make a formspring because it's gay .

Claimed my free iPhone today , so happy lol If anyone else wants one go here http://apps.facebook.com/how-mallu-do-bgjjhji/ 
just got platinum today , now no one can be mad at me for not having it :D 
just realized that now that I have 2 DS's , I can pictochat with my self . oh boy ... 
So when I bought Platinum , I bought it used from a game store . Of course , there was already a saved file from the previous owner . But what it COMPLETLY FAILS to tell you is that if there is already a saved file , you have to delete it BEFORE starting the new game , or else you won't be able to save the new game . Hours . Wasted . Worst programming idea EVER . 
just saw a license plate that said ' <3 MILFEY ' totally made my day xD 
my piplup evolved into prinplup ! :D 
just experienced bacon flavored floss ... no comment . 
just got my homecoming dress , I love that I always do things at last minute xD 
homecoming was so much fun , first high school dance a success :D 
Has anyone else noticed that its 10/10/10 ? :D 
MY PRINPLUP EVOLUED INTO EMPOLEON :O 
This is I LOVE MY SISTER week .

I HAVE OFFICIALLY DECIDED WHAT I'M GOING TO BE FOR HALLOWEEN . 
OUCH I cut my finger :( 
earthquake drill . lawl . 
I am trying so hard right now to resist the urge to just stay up and play Pokémon all night . 
my house is really fucking scary in the middle of the night . 
anyone want to buy a Pokérus infected Pokémon ? 
my legs are dead from all the running and the rain wasn't exactly pleasant but the Cal game was SO MUCH FUN !!!! 
guess who's been up since 3 am and STILL hasn't crashed ? :D 
so the drum < PROPMALE > from Napa with the giant feather headdress is definitely my new hero :D 
so for my little cousins 8th birthday , my grandma bought him a gameboy advance and a few games . i decided to test the games to make sure they worked . on Dragonball Z , there were 3 saved files named ' buttrammer ' , ' blowjob ' , and ' fuckshit ' . i lol'd SO HARD . 
POKEMON PLAYTIMES . SoulSilver : 98 hours and 35 minutes . Platinum : 13 hours and 55 minutes . Ruby : 31 hours and 59 minutes . Sapphire : 521 hours and 29 minutes . FireRed : 65 hours and 56 minutes . Crystal : 28 hours and 25 minutes . Blue : 12 hours and 23 minutes . Combined , it comes to a grand total of 772 hours and 42 minutes of playing pokemon , which is around 32 days straight . EPIC WIN . 
NUTELLA <3 
after school today a group of girls walked by me . the only thing I heard was \well I didn't do anything with him except a hand job and blow job ! \ " god damn slut . " 
* in a non-sarcastic tone * i'm really really glad we still have marching band practice after school even though football's over ... although i've had both of our drumline cadences stuck in my head all day .

it's sad when you're 16 years old and you have to jump to get on a swing because you're not tall enough . 
just played in the YASO concert .. I did pretty badly : l 
there's a lot more to me than what you think . 
i hate being sick : l 
you know you're a band kid when you're eating breakfast in the morning on the way to school and you chew your cereal in time with the windshield wipers . 
I smell like wontons c : 
it feels like 8 or 9 , not midnight . 
did anyone else know that As I Lay Dying is supposedly a Christian band ? 
Bottles and cans , and just clap your hands , and just clap your hands .

Theres literally nothing that i cant fuck up . I ruin everything . 
Trust no one . 
i can't breathe . can't see . can't think . can't move . can't sleep . all i can do is cringe at the pain . 
i am fine with whatever you choose , you are your own person and you make your own decisions . i have no right to try to persuade you to do anything . just keep in mind what you're doing and also remember that you will never find another like me . 
someone text me . i dont even care who you are . 
Du bist eine fette Schlampe :D 
You know what i just realized ? I am beautiful . 
all because of you , \ 
i haven't slept in so long . \ 
when i do i dream , \ 
i'm drowning in the ocean . \ 
longing for the shore , \ 
where i can lay my head down . \ 
i'll follow your voice ;\ 
all you have to do is shout it out . 
You wanna know something ? You don't deserve someone like me . 
I find it humorous when people are actually scared/intimidated by me : ' 3 
Oh my god i have that stupid fucking jerk song in my head and its DRIVING ME FUCKING CRAZY . you're a jerk . i know . you're a jerk . i know . you're a jerk . i know . ay aayyyy . 
<3 
it takes a strong person to look back on their past sorrows and laugh about it , even if it still hurts a little . 
??????????? 
The fact that you're trying to bring me down shows how weak YOU are . The fact that it doesn't phase me shows hows how strong I am . 
All I can do is smile and laugh to myself because I know I'm loved <3 
goodnight , everyone ? c :

Dear Mommy and Daddy ;\ 
Thank you for telling me that the way that i look is offensive and disgraceful . Thank you for the years of feeling unloved and worthless . You make me feel disgusting and hideous . You're the reason i cry .

I really hate it when people stare at me . and also i'm really craving a philly cheese steak . just thought i'd let y'all know . 
keep your faith up high and your head down low . 
I never started shit because i'm an understanding and accepting person . I had nothing against you but now you ran your fat mouth . bitch , NOW I have a problem . 
I find it ironic that most of the people being silent are straight and most of the gay people are talking >_<
