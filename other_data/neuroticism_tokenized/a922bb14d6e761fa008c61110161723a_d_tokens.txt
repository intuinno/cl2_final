I'm a mess ... I can't watch television without problems arising , I can't read anything that is even close to the subject without sighs of longing arriving , I can't draw anything without me almost ruining the picture , but most importantly , I can't listen to ANYTHING without my heart aching and my tears falling . When I sleep , I dream of possibilities , fantasies , horrors ending in amazement making me not want to wake up . 
\Other dancers may be on the floor
