Hair cut , manicure , pedicure , wax - nothing like it to make you feel better on your day off ! 
If cleaning is compulsive , is the conscious AVOIDANCE of cleaning compulsive too ?

I have 2 Compaq Proliant 1600 servers ($75 ea ) and 2 Compaq Proliant 3000 Rack mount servers ($250 ea ) that I'm trying to get rid of for the Public Library . Money goes to new equipment . The machines are loaded and in good working condition , P3 processors , would make a good file or backup server . Also have 14 Wireless PC Cards ( 802.11 b ) for $15 ea ( retail for $99 ) . Anyone know anyone who'd be interested in ATL ?

I too have a personal reason for ASKING if everyone could please put this as their status for one hour . I know my family will . Think of someone you know or love who has had cancer . My prayer is that in 2011 a cure will be found . Will you post it ? Just one hour . Do it for all of us . There are too many to mention who have fought ... and are fighting it . I hope to see this in the status of all my friends . 
No Phone Today ! Left it at home - will leave FB up though if you want to get hold of me ! ( Particularly for < PROPFIRST > & < PROPFIRST > )
