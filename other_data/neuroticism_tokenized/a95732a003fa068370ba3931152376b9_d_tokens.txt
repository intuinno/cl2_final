My current status is chillin . Watching Idol . 

Crap < PROPFIRST>'s right ! It's cook off time and I forgot all about it 
wow I just realized how much time one can spend on fb . ( welcome to the club < PROPMALE > ) 
Super sweet weather today 
I spent 32 dollars in gas today and I have to fill up before work tomorrow . What's the point of even having a job if it goes straight to the tank ? I made 234 dollars just in hourly in 2 weeks . After Barack Obama took some taxes I was only given 120 . THAT . IS . GAY . 
The government is shutting down ? My 9 year old brother pouts and shuts down too . 
Saw < PROPFIRST > last night . I think I might have a new favorite movie . Dude is hilarious . 
If your hungry and happen to be near a tgifridays then go cuz they have a huge part of the menu that comes with $10 gift cards for a $9 meal . It ends may 15 
Sucks this day does 
Yaaaa ... about last night lol 
So it's been about 3 weeks so I'm not surprised I lost my wallet . Just awesome ... 
Bow-chicka-bowow-watcha gonna say ! 
The best part of spring break . I've finally gone to bed earlier than 2 and woke up later than 7 . 
There's something special about today but I just can't quite put my finger on it . 
I have a new respect for apple . I put my headphones in the dryer and they still worked . 
I was on my way back from delivering pizza and I passed this guy riding a bike and trying to drink a water bottle at the same time . This dude hit something and did a motocross front flip landing on his face and soaked himself with his water bottle . I had a very important meeting to be at so I couldn't stop and help ...
