not normally one to whine about officiating ... but O.M.G. And I even love Northwestern , having spent three high school summers there studying music . Bitter ? Nope - cuz WE WON . War Damn Eagle !

has one more spot open in Philosophy of Law ( < PROPMALE > 4960 ) this semester , meeting at 9 a.m. Wednesday . Email or message me if interested -- first come , first served . 
is sick . But it's not mono . And probably not swine flu , either , despite what my kids say . 
loves facebook ! Six-year old < PROPFEMALE > comes in crying that 11-yo < PROPFEMALE > dug nails into her arm . < PROPFEMALE > denies it . But look at < PROPFEMALE>'s fb status : \My evil sister < PROPFEMALE > is being such a snitch ! \""

is trying to rally the energy to go out . The spirit is willing , but the 40-something flesh is weak , and tired , especially on Friday nights . 
spent several hours looking for the car tail before remembering that someone ripped it off in the Pit parking lot after we lost to Arkansas . 
WAR DAMN EAGLE ! If I see you , be sure to compliment my nails . 
Red Bull after 6 p.m. is an extraordinarily poor idea , no matter how many EC OMPs I have left to grade . 
has water coming out of her kitchen ceiling in two places , at apparently random times . Help ! 
just can't believe that ALL our season football tickets are gone , disappeared from the top of the bedroom bookshelf . If anyone ever sees Sect 6 Row 16 Seats 4 and 5 for sale this year , please throttle the seller and call the cops . 
has reprint tickets , oh yeah . But the seats are 5 and 6 , my mistake : no need to throttle a seller of Seat 4 .

Some dude at FUS monopolizing the only tv at the < PROPMALE > watching Florida-MSU . WTH ? Like a guy in OHIO knows ANYTHING about SEC football ! I told him the Gator win is a foregone conclusion , so please change to Auburn-LSU ; he says ( get this ) \LSU is up 14 . \ " As if I don't know that . Why do you think I own a Palm Pilot ? I want to WATCH ... LSU recover all our fumbles . Ya . ( Insert profane epithet here . ) " 
As bad as it was , the LSU game wasn't last night's most upsetting . That honor belongs to the one played in the hallway by some fellow hotel guests from 1:00 - 3:30 a.m. 
loved the Bioethics conference , can't wait to go next year ... but still glad to be home . 
doesn't suppose answering facebook messages counts toward her 15-30 minute daily writing requirement , does it ?

Facebook just invited me to share the latest news with my husband by writing on his wall . Yeah , that's about how it goes some days . 
WARNING ! To all grandparents : It's finals week , the most lethal time of year for your demographic . Exercise extreme caution in all things ! 
finally succumbed to whatever evil respiratory bug has been threatening all week : too sick to get the kids off to school this morning , and too sick to stay up answering last-minute emails about tomorrow's final . Sorry , y'all :( 
is still sick , but entering the LAST of the Fall 09 grades into AU Access ... better'n chicken soup !

for the final days of Doppelganger week , I've exchanged my more youthful picture ( the last time someone told me I looked like < PROPFEMALE > Peters was in 1984 ) for a more current one .

is OUTRAGED to have been hit while legally parked ( that car over there in the profile pic ? Has a dent the size of a garbage can lid behind the driver's door ) , and the only thing her insurance company will do is pay me $2000 and TAKE MY CAR AWAY . Anyone seen a < PROPMALE > convertible with < PROPMALE > transmission offered for less than $2K lately ? No , I didn't think so . 
Kittens ! Black ones , white ones , calico ones and orange ones . Nine altogether , looking every bit like GRADUATION PRESENTS ( especially those orange ones ) . Come on , you know you -- or someone you know -- wants to take home an Auburn kitten . 
VZ Navigator is the 21st century version of < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE>'s < PROPFEMALE > .

leaving on retreat for the weekend , with two of my favorite people -- and ( if it's not raining ) my favorite car . 
has apparently vanished off the face of auburn.edu . If only I'd gotten a heads-up to notify my email address book -- like the Eastern APA session chair who plans to correspond with me about the paper I'm presenting there . 
Three down , six to go . And after watching people do it as they walked across the stage , I finally get that \X\ " thing they've been making with their arms since they were freshmen . "

looking for someone to love ( and raise ) these kittens . 
Obviously , what's on my mind is finding a home for the latest batch of kittens . Why do all the strays in < PROPFIRST > County come to MY barn to give birth ? Do you suppose it has to do with the food we leave there for our own barn cats ? 
Sign in front of a little white church on US 27 : \Catholicism leads you straight to hell . \ " Next sign : \ " Welcome to Luthersville . \ " Someone's got a profound sense of place -- or else a 500-year old grudge . "

A brand new transmission for an 04 GMC Savana 3500 after only 118,000 < PROPMALE > . This is why I miss my VW Cabrio . This , and the feature by which I could put the top down . 
in < PROPFEMALE > with < PROPFEMALE > , only halfway through sharing updates on our ( 21 combined ) children 
Studying to be a saint .

Teenagers ... 
wishing Number Three Son a happy 17th ! 
I'd be more excited about school starting in 12 days if I didn't have so much shopping to do beforehand . 
just moved the boxes of books out of < PROPFEMALE > and turned in the office key . The career is officially over . Grateful to have had the opportunity , but also grateful to be able to < PROPFEMALE > it up . 
just spent as much time following comment links on facebook as it would have taken to prepare three weeks ' worth of lectures . What's wrong with this picture ? Gah . 
safest I've ever felt alone on a bike path ... everywhere I look , another Green Beret walks by . 
just finished something I've wanted to do for the last decade : biked the < PROPMALE > Riverwalk in its entirety , out & back . Thirty < PROPMALE > ( plus a couple extra when I got lost on Ft . Benning ) . My fingers are numb , my arms & legs are twitching , my tailbone has been permanently reshaped ... but I'm pretty pleased with myself ! 
The fingertips on my right hand and my whole left arm below the elbow are still numb . Lovely -- I finally find a killer cardio activity that doesn't destroy my plantar fascias ... and it destroys my dexterity instead . 
moving my baby girl into her dorm room 
It has just sunk in : my daughter is a college soccer player . Someone else is now washing her uniforms and keeping track of her shinguards - and getting paid to do it !

Wow , look at all that fb activity ! Who'd have guessed I've been hostage in a waiting room , having forgotten my current reading material , for almost two hours ? 
driving through upstate SC with my AU flag flying . Cmon defense - no more of those td drives , pls 
the only thing worse than the way this game is going is having to hear it on Clemson radio

How great is it to be an Auburn Tiger ?? On a scale of 1-10 , try SIXTY-FIVE ! 
Every time I go on facebook , another former student has had a baby . I can't explain , but it's making me feel really old . 
Best Husband Award goes to the guy who left the tailgate to walk all the way back to the car to drive all the way back to the house because * I * left the tickets in the drawer . 
Gentlemen , I think we've got us a defense . Oh , and a Heisman winner . 
Sorry , Ole Miss . That silly \Number One Loses\ " streak stops here . " 
So proud of < PROPFIRST > ( first place , Men's 19 & under , Opelika Trick-or-Trot ) and < PROPFEMALE > ( 4 SES cuts , 5 best times -- including 13 seconds off the 100 Fly ) . Now , if LiveStats will just tell me that the < PROPFEMALE > pulled out another OT win , my Sports Parent day will be complete ! 
I want to see R . < PROPFIRST>'s useless hit to McCalebb ( and subsequent misguided celebration ) on YouTube . Over and over again . 
so far , more trick than treat 
Do < PROPFEMALE > wrappers recycle ? Because I've got enough on my kitchen floor for a brand new campus building . 
did vote in the election , even if the little badge thingy returns a 404 error on my blackberry . Also visited Oakwood Cemetery ... no badge thingy for that , either . 
Ohh , I got friends in judicial places ... ( apologies to < PROPMALE > ) . Congrats , < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > !

in Milwaukee . It's cold , and no one says \War Eagle . \ " I'm ready to go home . " 
Three NCAA sports in three states in three days ... I'm exhausted ! 
Turned into our driveway to find 16 wild turkeys strutting up the middle of it . They would NOT get out of the way ... until I tried to take a picture through the windshield ; then they all skedaddled into the woods . 
Wow ... I haven't been in labor for eight whole years now . ( Happy birthday , Lucy-Lu ! ) 
Looking forward to a fabulous girls ' weekend in Atlanta with my pretty NINETEEN YEAR-OLD daughter . Happy birthday , < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Herewith , an Open Invitation to anyone stuck in Auburn and separated from family on Thanksgiving : please come for dinner . 
Everything's up-to-date in Kansas City ... the baggage claim carousel is right outside the gate ! If only they had high-speed rail to Springfield ; there's a little family there I'd love to see . 
Happy Sweet Sixteen , < PROPFEMALE > ! Or , Mahlee . PoPcornchu . By any other name , still as sweet . 
Thankful for ... the three sheriff cars with lights flashing and sirens blaring that turned ahead of me into my neighborhood and not up my driveway . 
Thankful for ... all 11 of us at the table , didn't run oiit of anything but mashed potatoes . 
Thankful for ... hot tea and cold medicine , which kept my nose from running while my hands were busy preparing food all day . 
Thankful for ... coming in from an impromptu after-dinner visit to friends just in time to see my gallant husband putting away one of many , many dishes he had washed . 
Well , well , look what day it is . War damn . 
touchdown REFEREE ! oh ! Do I see Bama players with their arms in the air ? Flag ! Flag ! 
no review ? 
Didn't we see the mirror image of this game last year ? 
We are so classy , we can refrain from celebrating so as not to offend our hosts and their striped friends ! 
Get thee to Toomers , Plainsdwellers ! We'll show the Tide how to roll . War Damn Eagle ! 
Hamilton's dinner special tonight : roasted duck . I smell a National Championship ! 
Death . Are you ready ? 
Anyone in town have a chain saw and nothing to do at 7 a.m. ? There is a seriously mature tree barricading our driveway . ( Hm , < PROPFIRST>'s Christmas list seems to be writing itself tonight ! ) 
thank God for good neighbors ( and their tool shed ) 
My shopping list : cat food , rubber gloves , a 23-in flourescent bulb and napkins . Paints a rather disturbing picture , doesn't it ? 
Two AU coach buses with a police escort just passed me on E University . Who d'you suppose it is , and wherever might they be going ? To a big ol ' chicken fry maybe ? WDE ! 
Basked in SEC championship euphoria for 5 minutes ; priced air fare , hotel & game tickets for 1 minute , now back to real life . < PROPFEMALE > says she's HUNGRY . 
At < PROPFEMALE>'s with my < PROPFEMALE > . Next best thing to being at Toomer's . 
Sudden heartbreaking realization : I only get to see this team play one more time . 
Sunrise over Mobile Bay , Mass at the Cathedral , lunch ( and dessert ! ) at Three Georges , shopping at the Carnival Museum gift shop , riding the elevator to the 26th floor of the Renaissance Riverview . What a romantic getaway ... were it not for the two daughters who came along for the express purpose of staging a fight-a-thon . 
so relieved not to have stacks of term papers and finals to grade right now ! 
got a plan ... for the 10th of Jan ... involves the van ... ( not really ; I'm taking the SUV ) 
forget what I said about the SUV - just booked flight to Phoenix ! 
Can't wait to see that big beautiful grin , supersized , on the outer wall of Jordan-Hare . In the immortal last words of his acceptance speech , WAR EAGLE ! 
Christmas tree's a-comin , Christmas tree's a-comin , Christmas tree's a-comin , I'd better clean the room .

So grateful < PROPFEMALE > came home Tuesday night instead of driving through Atl yesterday . 
I am absolutely for keeping Christ in Christmas , but there's something about these Christmas-light crosses that evoke ( shall we say ? ) some regional discomfort 
O Key of < PROPFIRST > , come ! 
O , < PROPFEMALE > of the East , come ! 
O < PROPMALE > of All Nations , come ! 
Advantage #217 of living in a college town : plenty of parking at the mall the week before Christmas . ( Not missing the Mall of < PROPFEMALE > right now , not at all . ) 
O < PROPMALE > , come ! 
Dear < PROPFEMALE > - Just one item on the list : Cam < PROPMALE > back on < PROPFIRST > Dye field next season . 
Knowing I was going to Atlanta with my husband today ( leaving the nine kids at home ) , I thought I'd save time by baking all the cookies for tomorrow night's party yesterday . Guess what I'm doing tomorrow ? Hint : look back at the parentheses . 
Come celebrate the Third Day of Christmas with us tomorrow night , drop in between 6 and 9 ! Shepherds , kings , or in between -- all are welcome ! 
Four calling birds ! 
just had a nice long visit with one of my favorite people in the world :) 
Five GOOOLDEN rings ! Keep the celebration going , y'all! 
Vanderbilt basketball arena ... here to cheer for Marquette , but can't shake impulse to shout \WAR EAGLE ! \"" 
Six geese a'laying! Christmas is already ( only ) halfway over . Alas . 
Seven swans a'swimming ... no doubt while wearing silly hats , beads and blowing noisemakers . 
Ten lords a'leaping . Probably leaping over the Christmas stuff that's fallen down and been strewn all over the house . 
Twelve drummers , Twelfth Night . Another ChrIstmas ( and daily status countdown from an old Ethics teacher ) comes to an end . < PROPFEMALE > , y'all! 
Just learned the Grand Canyon is too far away from Glendale for a day trip on Sunday . Boo . 
War Damn Arizona bound ! 
Wishing Happy Fiftieth Anniversary to my mom and daddy ! And Happy Birthday to the present we gave them on their 36th -- < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Campbell Pudner ! 
God , < PROPMALE > me the serenity ... First of three legs of Phoenix flight already delayed . 
landed in Newark , with a rousing rendition of the fight song ... at the gate right next to the one from which we depart for Detroit . Clearly , < PROPMALE > is wrong . Oh wait , we got proof of that in November 
Detroit ! 
On the plane to Phoenix ! Looks like an Auburn charter - WDE ! 
War Damn Phoenix ! We're here ! Fourteen hours and 20 minutes after leaving The Plains ! 
Off to Mass ... will meet the Perkinses there , just like home ! Special prayer intention : safe travels for < PROPFEMALE > back to Belmont . 
so many cool things to look at ! 
my < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > sunglasses were clearly not designed with Arizona in mind . I need a heavily tinted whole-head bubble 
Heartsick for all the folks who planned to be here but can't get out of Atl or Bhm . Can't deny I'm hoping it opens a ticket for < PROPFIRST > and I to both get in , but still sincerely heartsick . 
Gotta find a Wells Fargo ATM , get the boy out of bed , then trek to what a Tempe resident assures me is \the other side of the world . \ " How's the student Will Call line looking ? " 
rumor has it metro Phoenix has run out of beer 
The O-people are blowing duck lures . The kind that mean ( as it's just been explained to me ) , \Some ducks are gonna get shot . \"" 
Phone finally on charger after dying in the first quarter . Leaving it in the car , going back into the Scottsdale Plaza resort to gaze adoringly at members of our National War Damn Championship team ! 
Facebook , ESPN , newspapers , networks ... just can't stop reliving the game . Sleep ? It can wait till those long flights and layovers tomorrow . 
< PROPFEMALE > is saying our flight from Salt Lake should arrive in Atlanta on time , 6:14 a.m. tomorrow . But then , < PROPFEMALE>'s been known to tease . 
Long Beach . No jubilant \War Eagle\ " or fight song from the back of the plane this time out of consideration for all the flying ducks . " 
The terminal at Long Beach is a double-wide trailer , where one can buy 2 Drumsticks , a Dasani and an 8 oz sugar free Red Bull for $16 . But the people are nice . 
Salt Lake City . Wish we could find a < PROPFEMALE > employee to change the channel from CNN to Leno . Needing a Tiger fix . 
It appears as though we're getting on a plane to Atlanta . 
Sweet Almost-Home Atlanta ! Here's hoping for clear highways . What a War Damn Weekend ! 
From ATL direct to St. < PROPFIRST>'s 8 am Mass to give thanks for safe return and imminent shower . Followed by a clean outfit that is ( forgive me , but it's been 5 straight days ) NOT orange . 
AU flags and car magnets everywhere -- for a minute there , I thought I was back in Phoenix ! 
Aw , Cam . 
Family's still family , even when the kiddos leave the nest prematurely . Good luck , Cam and < PROPMALE > -- if it gets too nasty out there , y'all know where to find some love . 
So long , Football ; hello , Swimming ... AU women and men beat Texas ! Roll the corner again ! And < PROPFEMALE > made the Sectional cut in the 500 Free ! Roll her room ! 
for some reason , I am utterly incapable of finding my way home from < PROPMALE > this morning . 
< PROPFEMALE > took off 1.44 seconds off her 50 Free ! If you know swimming , you know that is a SICK drop . Well under the sectional cut @ 26.52 . WTG , baby girl !! 
Not to second-guess the liturgical calendar , but my scale suggests that fast days should follow feast days instead of precede them . Gah . 
< PROPFEMALE > continues to rock the Aquatic Center with a 58.10 in the 100 Free . Two full seconds off . 
Another second bites the dust : 30.82 on the 50 Back 
Gearing up to start P90X . What ? Both sets of dvd's are missing ? oh DARN . Guess I'll climb into bed with a book instead . 
I will never tire of reliving 1/10/11 . 
All the vestiges of Christmas are now snug in their bubble-wrapped attic beds . Thanks , < PROPFIRST > ! 
on my way to Belmont to see my girl ... though in spirit , we're both on our way to DC 
welcome to Atlanta where the players play ... and the rest of us sit in traffic all day 
There's something freakish about the way daveFm knows exactly what song I've been dying to hear , when I couldn't have told if asked 
Second favorite billboard ever : \got monks ? \ " on I-85 North in Spartanburg . ( First favorite ? \ " ALL IN\ " on I-10 West in Phoenix . ) " 
Flashing blue lights are so distracting when you're driving ! 
Sitting in the Bridges parking lot commenting meaninglessly on everybody's status . One would almost think I wasn't anxious to get home after a weekend away . 
just sent another kid into oral surgery with a reassuring hug ... and a firm intention to video the hilarious aftermath 
Extremely grateful to < PROPFIRST > for all the help around the house these last few days ! 
What did I get on here for , again ? It was very specific , and should only have taken 30 seconds . Thirty minutes ago . Gah . 
Conscripted to cut my daughter's boyfriend's hair . I feel a lose-lose coming on . 
Twelve oz of Sugar Free Red Bull ahead of time makes Zumba so much easier ! 
just saw a student walking past < PROPFIRST > , with JJ's shape , style , hair and gait . Either my firstborn has discovered how to bilocate ( new Verizon technology ? ) , or it's an Engineer thang . Miss you , Jayj <3 
Flourless peanut butter cookies are the enemy . 
There is an 8-point < PROPMALE > staring at me through my dining room window . 
There Be Dragons . Tonight . In Atlanta . How fun !!! 
Mad about not getting to drink my mug of hot tea before leaving with kids today -> grateful that I hadn't , so I could pour it on my frozen windshield . 
I'm sorry , < PROPFEMALE > , but your Cap and Goggles Replacement program expired after the fourth set . Maybe you could ask Ms. < PROPFEMALE > if there are any jobs you could do to earn one before Southeasterns . Something involving bleach and a toothbrush . 
So my 12- and 14-yo daughters kept begging to see Black Swan ... until I said I'd take them -- and even sit elsewhere -- because I like dancer movies . Suddenly they didn't want to anymore . Puzzling ... until I heard < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE>'s review . ( Thanks , friend ! ) 
Sidebar ad : \Philosopher ? Get found by the people who need you . \ " Feels like I'm being scolded for hiding from my kids . " 
These sidebar ads are going over the top . I don't question one for getting rid of wrinkles , but why the accompanying picture of a < PROPFEMALE > ? And not just < PROPFEMALE > , an African-American < PROPFEMALE > ? 
Not watching the Superbowl . I refuse to allow another gridiron image to overwrite < PROPMALE > Byrum's National Championship-winning field goal . 
Starting to wax philosophical about social networking as a time warp . Time to get off and back to work . 
Since noon : Cati to babysitting job , to Mass , < PROPFEMALE>'s excuse to Auburn High , < PROPFIRST > to bank , < PROPFEMALE > & < PROPFIRST > to Subway , to Waverly to borrow something , get Cati from babysitting job , get Nate & < PROPFEMALE > from bus stop , < PROPFEMALE > to swim practice , Nate to basketball , Nate & < PROPFIRST > home , Cati to tan , get < PROPFEMALE > from boyfriend's , get < PROPFEMALE > from pool . Then make dinner . Someday , they tell me , I'm going to miss these days . Snort . 
Waiting to pay for a pic and passport to send my baby girl to help folks in El < PROPMALE > over Spring Break . You can help pay for the rest ! Even $1 will work miracles ! Go here : http://focus.convio.net/site/TR/Events/General?pxfid=1760&fr_id=1100&pg=fund 
My faith in Firth is restored , after the Mamma Mia debacle . Thumbs up -- er , curtsy -- for The < PROPMALE>'s Speech . 
How do these deadly things get into my house ? Why can I not break free of their torment ? Blasted Girl Scout cookies ! 
Happy < PROPFIRST > Day to all ... and Happy Feast Day to You Know Who You Are ! 
The land of the freeze and the home of the Brewers . Marquette vs St < PROPFIRST>'s tonight ... our < PROPFIRST>'s date . 
Feeling a bit like < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > and the rest of the Who's: some Grinch-hole can take our trees , but not our spirit . War Eagle ! 
Every < PROPFEMALE > flight makes me a bigger Airtran fan . Should be in Mobile ... uh , sometime before Mardi Gras . 
Praying for the fruits of PyV this weekend ! 
Things I never learned en route to a PhD #61 : If your hotel soap is in a cellophane wrapper instead of a box , open it before you put your hands under the faucet . 
Unhappily wasting time on fb while waiting for the Airtran A+ reservation < PROPFEMALE > to load and/or my call to get past the busy signal ( 28 minutes and counting ) . Is the whole world making Spring Break reservations today , or what ? 
Is there a linguistic connection between \grounded\ " and \ " digging a deeper hole\ " ? Because there sure seems to be a causal connection . " 
Picking up my Superbackstroker , heading to Nashville for Southeastern Champ'ships . Go < PROPFEMALE > ! Go AUB ! 
Why , yes , that IS < PROPFIRST > McDonald in my profile pic . We were at a party honoring the girl in the middle . ( Love ya , < PROPFEMALE >!) 
< PROPFEMALE>'s 200 Free = 2.09.55 . Another sectional cut . Not too shaby for just having projectiled her breakfast into a trash can on deck . 
Slipping on the start of a 50 Backstroke can really kill a time , and what should have been a spot in the finals ... but not a champion's spirit ! You go , < PROPFEMALE > - - smash that 30 in the relay tonight ! <3 
The world-famous Fr Baker , CeeCee and the rest of the Vandy FOCUS team , and Jesus Christ , too ! Pretty nice payoff for a chilly stroll down to Children's Hospital ! 
AU-burn RE-lay ! Let's go Susanna-Ronni-Isabel-Hadley ! 
25.75 on her split of the free relay ... WOOWEEE ! 
New bests in the 50 free ( 26.34 ) and 100 IM ( 1:09 . 90 ) , but still no Top-8 finish . Hate to see her disappointed ... good thing it passes so quickly ! Now , on to the 500 . 
Another best ... 5:40 . 80 ( 500 free ) . Sandwich , nap , and back for the Medley Relay tonight . 
50 Back MR split = 30.06 . Way to go , < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Everybody please email aquaregum@yahoo.com to wish JJ a happy 22nd birthday ! He can't come home & be with the family today :( 
100 Back 1:06 . 58 ( add . 23 ); 100 Free 59.88 ( add 1.78 ) . Anybody know some tricks for dealing with pre-race nausea ? Throwing up in the crowded stands after warmups has to take some of the fun out of this Big Meet experience . 
Trying to outrun the storms , leaving Nashville now . Adventure , anyone ? 
Cullman . Hotel . Bring it , Mother Nature . 
Getting ready to dash to Auburn . Prepare to repeat trip in 2 wks for Sectionals ! 
Made it back in time for ( most of ) Mass , nary a tornado in sight the whole way ! Now off to see my stylist -- 4 days in a chlorine fog will do such a number on your hair ! 
Not too proud to ask : what is up with the < PROPFIRST > Sheen quotes , y'all ? 
Entirely unsurprised at trouble in Wisconsin : I knew < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > in college . 
Saw The Grace Card today . I'm all about the theme , but found the movie to be trite and predictable . Perhaps I am unfairly comparing it to THERE BE DRAGONS , opening in just two months . 
Laissez < PROPMALE > bon temps rouler -- jusque minuit . 
Lenten resolution : Before every utterance -- oral , print or electronic -- ask ( 1 ) is it true ? ( 2 ) is it kind ? ( 3 ) is it necessary ? This , and no Sugar Free Red Bulls . 
Age Group Sectionals ( Southern Zone , Eastern Section ) . Go , < PROPFEMALE > ! Go , Auburn Aquatics ! 
Going to the finals ( 50 back) ! First time ever ( not incl relays) ! WTG , < PROPFEMALE > ! 
< PROPFEMALE > A-finaled in the 50 free ( 26.11 ) ! Sectionals evidently agrees with her :) 
< PROPFEMALE > knocked down the 100 back with a 1:04 . 08 -- cut more than 2 seconds off her seed time for the meet . That should keep her smiling for the 5-hr drive home . 
My idea of the perfect Spring Break : the fam goes to watch The Dance , and I stay home , alone , to clean the house . Sarcasm ? Absolutely not . 
The south wing of the house is completely decluttered -- closets and all . O Happy Day ! Now for the center and north ... much easier ... 
Looking for a new , creative and very effective Lenten penance ? Try sweeping a half canister of airsoft pellets off a wood floor .
