Who can deny the snazzy of that ? Are you denying the snazzy of that ? 
How can your heart have feelings for someone your mind says you dont know ? All I know is I have never missed strangers so much . 
Some days are rough , some days are smooth , but every day is an opportunity . 
5 days , 6 basketball games , tired , cut , bruised , beaten , black eye , sore all over , knee pain , and much more ......... i have missed this feeling so much :) 
If you’re late to something then your tardy ... if you’re late again then you’re retardy ... if referring back to the first your tarded ... but if referring to the second then your retarded ... so if you’re late twice or more to the same thing ... your retarded . 
I LOVE BEING WEIRD !!!!!!!!!!! normal just seems so ........ boring . 
My heart-feelers are happy :D 
No matter the circumstances , good or bad , I choose to trust God wholeheartedly because that the only way things can end well . 
so tired but cant sleep ....... ugh 
today was a good day :) 
so this morning i went puddle jumpin b4 class and tapped someone on their shoulder to get them to look the wrong way as i walked by . haha i act like a child :)
