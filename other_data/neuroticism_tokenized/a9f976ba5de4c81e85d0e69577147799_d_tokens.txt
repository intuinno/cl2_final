I basically have a semester left of High school :) \ 
It's crazy to believe that in less than 5 years , I'll be teaching Spanish !!!! 
I missed facebook to much . 
HELL YES ! \ 
:D 
The time for change is now . 
I like it when I log in and see a little red number over my notifications :) 
When my mom talks fast to me in spanish , it sounds like she's speaking Japanese . \ 
I don't understand a word she says lol . 
I had the creepiest dream . 
It's the last day of the 2010 year . 
I can't wait till the summer . \ 
Finally get to < PROPFEMALE > out with my california friends :) 
Defiantly not looking forward to school tomorrow . \ 
I want more vacation !! 
Owning a nice camera makes you a camera owner , Not a photographer ! 
I walked into my room , hoping to play some guitar . I go to turn on the light , and I hear a big crack . that's when I realized , I left my guitar on the floor . 
How come there is never any mexicans in the assemblies at school ? \ 
El tiempo para cambiar es ahora ! 
Como Estan ? 
Hoes these days 
Everybody has photographic memory , You just need to find that film . 
This week has gone by surprisingly fast . 
So today I learned how to say Cat in Chinese . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > . 
I'm not shaving my face till the end of the semester . 
YEAH SEAHAWKS ! :D \ 
We sent those pretentious over-rated Saints back to New Orleans . 
irritated when girls say \all guys are assholes\ " on their facebook status . \ 
I have a new brother :) 
What's up with all these middle schoolers being in relationships and shit . 
If women aren't made to cook , then why do they have milk and eggs inside them ? 
went bowling last night , I should do it more often . \ 
On Sundays from 8 am to 2 pm games are only $1.88 \ 
and shoe rentals are only $2.00 -ish\ 
Who want's to go bowling next week ? ;D 
Check out my new photo album :) 
McCain- 728,122 likes on facebook . \ 
Obama- 17,754,941 likes on facebook . \ 
Republicans fail . 
I study and study , and I didn't even finish the test ;( 
I lost 2 games of Horse to some random viejo at the YMCA :( \ 
Need to work on my shooting skills . lol 
I like being a senior . \ 
I don't get any homework in any of my classes :) 
No homework , No taking notes , No stinky locker rooms for 3 whole days :) \ 
Can life be any better :D 
Why are people Racist ? 
Who will you be rooting for on Sunday ? \ 
Seahawks all the way ;) 
Buenos Dias :) 
So today my stepdad Fransisco purchased 18 acres of land in Mexico for 10 grand . Even though he thinks we are all going to die in May . 
Yeah ! \ 
We bought the last copy of the best movie ever made . Tenacious D and the Pick of Destinty . 
80 Percent of the worlds Herorin originates from Afganastan . Whenever you use it , you are actually supporting terrorism . 
Whatever happened to Bro's before Hoes ? 
I wonder if I will still be facebook friends with you 5 years from now . 
Thank you Dr. < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > Jr. \ 
If it wasn¿t for your bravery and courage , the United States of < PROPFEMALE > wouldn¿t be the great country it is today . 
Forget the past , Remember the future . 
So < PROPFIRST > went to go pick up his bowling ball off the rack and he lost his grip on the ball and it flew off his hand and hit some little girls knee 
I feel like going on a bike ride . \ 
I think I'll do that ;) 
Today has been pretty great :) \ 
Bowling , Bike Riding , and I'm about to go play some Basketball at the YMCA . 
Much better :) 
I hate it when the \typing ' symbol won't go away when your trying to talk to someone . \ 
Thank god P.E is finally over . \ 
No more immature freshmen for the rest of the day 
Some telemarking paisa just called me . \ 
\Yo se mucho de tu destino 
I can speak Japanese too ! \ 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > shing shong kwaaa ! 
Things aren`t what they use to be . We`ve changed . 
Will there ever be a Mexican/American president in my lifetime ? 
American Idol ain't the same without < PROPMALE > :(

I love Seattle Police , Shoot first , ask questions later ! \ 
I think there was over 10 unnecessary roughness incidents in 2010 . \ 
and from the looks of it , there is going to be more this year :) 
The weekend is finally here . \ 
To bad I didn't plan anything for today . \ 
I'll go take a nap now .

Jugando el Black Ops con todo mis amigos ;D

How could I be lost if I have nowhere to go ? 
Called in sick but I still came into school anyway to finish my finals , regardless of my fever and sore throat . 
Just killed 2 hours by sitting in my dark room playing the guitar 
If you had a time machine , and you could only use it ONCE , to go there and come back , where would you go ? :) 
If you could permanently numb a part of your body . \ 
Which part would it be ? 
If you could see any musician perform live . \ 
Alive or Dead . \ 
Who would you want to see ? and what song would you want them to play first ? :) 
Today I'm going to open up my very own checking account :) 
Would you rather get your leg chopped off ? \ 
or your arm ? 
If you could bring back anyone from the dead ? \ 
Even if they died over 1,000 years ago . \ 
Who would you pick ? and Why ? 
DUDE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \ 
HE GAVE ME A D+\ 
MY GRADE WAS A 69.92% \ 
THAT'S A C ! :( 
If you could relate you're life to any TV show or movie . \ 
which one would it be ? 
what would you do if the creepy janitor sent you a friend request ? \ 
Deny him or add him ? 
Would you rather be a slave for 6 months , or permanently own a sweatshop filled with child workers , once they hit the age of 12 , they kick them out and hire younger kids , and every child works from 5 A.M to 11 P.M and only makes 2 cents a day . 
The ability to hold your breath forever , or the ability to change your voice into anyones voice ? 
Love is like a cracker , when it breaks you can't fix it 
We are best friends on facebook , but you don't even saying hi to me at school :/ 
Eastmont is one filthy school .

I HATE DIGORNO PIZZA COMMERCIALS ! \ 
They're all over the TV , Youtube , and the internet ! \ 
Enough is enough !!!!! \ 
I don't care if your crappy pizza is only 5 dollars . \

Got a hot date this saturday ;)

Tell a girl she is beautiful ; she'll believe it for a moment . \ 
Tell a girl she is ugly ; she'll believe it for a lifetime . 
If you get caught sleeping in class : slowly raise your head and say , \Amen \""

I still have a whole untouched pizza left over ! \ 
Who want's some :)

My dad whipped up the B.B.Q and made some cheeseburgers ! ;D 
I have a tough question for you guys ! \ 
I thought of it when I lit 34 sparklers at once ! \ 
Does hot water extinguish fire at the same rate as cold water ?! 
My dad scared me ! \ 
I went to go get some doritos and as soon as I take the first chip out of the bag , he appears out of nowhere ! 
I hate loaning people short ammounts of money . \ 
When I ask them to pay me back . \ 
They always argue and say dude , it's only 2 dollars 
My step mom yelling at my brother and I : \You guys are the biggest weenies in the world\ " \ 
Describe yourself in 2 words .

Enlist in the Navy ? Start my own buisness ? Go to community college and transfer somewhere ? Move to Sweden ?!?!?! Fuk 
Why spend 8 to 10 years trying to become a dentist ? \

I miss Washington . \ 
but I feel as if I belong in California . 
The things we fear the most have already happened to us . 
Now I'm feeling fly like a G6 
Behind every successful person lies a pack of haters . 
should I go to college in Wenatchee ? \ 
or go to college in Seattle ? \ 
I've been accepted to 4 different colleges in Seattle . \ 
I need to let them know soon if I'll be attending . 
So a blond goes to see a doctor . \ 
She tells him that all of her body is in extreme pain . \ 
She touches her leg , starts screaming . \ 
She scratches her arm , screams in anguish . \ 
She pokes her forehead , she goes crazy . \ 
That's when the doctor tells her that she has a broken finger . 
Dude ! \ 
All I have to do is maintain a 2.5 at any community college and I'm already accepted into a legit university ! ^_^ 
I had a dream that I still had to go back to high school ? \

I started drawning a bunch of random lines . \ 
and I ended up drawing my step mom ? haha 
Can't we go a day without any yelling in this house ? 
Watching the X games on Espn . 
Attractive women say their not attractive for attention . \ 
Unattractive women say they are attractive because they want to feel better about themselves and want to look like they don't care . 
Just got off the phone with my ex girlfriend from 8th grade . \ 
sometimes , it's just better to keep things locked in the past . 
I don't even like pepsi . \ 
Coke is better

She needs to G.T.F.O

New music sucks . 
I haven't shaved in over a week and now I have a full grown beard ! 
I left my guitar in Washington . \ 
I can feel myself forgeting how to play . 
I dreamt I almost got arrested , but the dude at the store let me take the < PROPFEMALE > for free ^_^ 
Does a piece of bread still have the same amount of calories after it was toasted ? 
Generation after generation , we all get slowly stupider . \ 
Technology will soon take over . \ 
My 11 year old step brother can't even read a standard clock . 
That was like a 20 minute non stop jam session ! \ 
I haven't made music in so long ! 
Nobody touches my gameboy except for me ! -_- 
Carls Jr for dinner ! ;)

When I was in the 8th grade . \ 
The vice principal told every student in the school that they can monitor our social networking profiles at any moment to search for profanity or threats against others . \ 
So when I made my first myspace profile , I didn't use a single curse word till half way through freshmen year . \ 
and now I look at all these kids on facebook talking shit and using all kinds of cuss words I've never heard of . \ 
Times have changed , I'll tell you that ! 
I applied to the University of Nevada : Las Vegas\

My little brother locked me out of the room . \

They shouldn't legalize weed . \

You don't see the school drug dealer or his best coustomers getting straight A's . 
My cat wants to go outside ! \ 
Fuck that shit , I'm not getting stabbed . 
I had a dream I was a russian spy . \ 
and my mission was to throw a box of < PROPFEMALE > onto a boat . ( there was a tracking device in the < PROPFEMALE > )\ 
but the boat was docked at a holloween themed rollercoaster park . \ 
and Vin Diesel was trying to kill me . \ 
I ended up stabbing him in the throat , but the boat already took off . \ 
so I failed my mission :( 
I can't wait to go back to Washington , < PROPFEMALE > out with all my high school homies , get a job , get my drivers license , go to college , meet some girls ;) \ 
I think I might have to cut my vacation short O.o 
I just took a practice S.A.T test . \

There is a riot in London right now . 
So when black people started wearing their pants low , \ 
white people called it \saggin\ " \ 
Whenever I wake up , my chihuahua always says goodmorning to me :) 
Apparently having your own opinion about marijuana is wrong .
