Never give up . No matter what is going on . Develop the heart ? \ 
Too much energy is spent on developing the mind instead of the heart . Develop the heart . Be compassionate . Not just to your friends , but to everyone . Be compassionate . Work for peace . In your heart and in the world . And I say again , never give up . No matter what is happening . No matter what is going on around you . \ 
Never give up !

Beauty is not caused . It is . - < PROPFEMALE > Dickinson 
“We need not think alike to love alike . ” -Ferenc Dávid 
According to my own experience , the highest level of inner calm comes from the development of love and compassion . The more concerned we are with the happiness of others , the more we increase our own well-being . Friendliness and warmth towards others allow us to relax and help us to dispel any sense of fear or insecurity so we can overcome whatever obstacles we face . \ 
-Dalai Lama 
\Always be mindful of the kindness and not the faults of others . \ " ~ Buddha " 
\Impossibilities are merely things which we have not yet learned . \ " ~ Charles W . Chestnutt "

Ultimately , we are responsible for our own < PROPFEMALE > . It may seem to us that our fate is predetermined , whether by our genes or by our environment . What really matters , however , is how we can improve ourselves from this moment forward , \ 
... how we can change the circumstances that we find ourselves in . \ 
- Daisaku Ikeda 
Beauty resides in its diversity , where myths and truths coexist . 
The problems we face today , violent conflicts , destruction of nature , poverty , hunger and so on , are human-created problems which can be resolved \ 
through human effort , understanding and the development of a sense of brotherhood and sisterhood . ... We need to cultivate a universal responsibility for one another and the planet we share . \

Pets have mindfulness down . When was the last time you noticed your pet lying awake , seemingly worrying about completing his to-do list ? 
\There are two primary choices in life : to accept conditions as they exist 
Mindfulness is the aware , balanced acceptance of the present experience . \ 
It isn't more complicated than that . \ 
It is opening to or receiving the present moment , \ 
pleasant or unpleasant , just as it is , \ 
without either clinging to it or rejecting it . \

If we understood the power of our thoughts , \ 
we would guard them more closely . \ 
If we understood the awesome power of our words , \ 
we would prefer silence to almost anything negative . \ 
In our thoughts and words we create\ 
... our own weaknesses and our own strengths . \ 
Our limitations and joys begin in our hearts . \ 
We can always replace negative with positive . \

We have to make ourselves heard . \

When you devote your life to achieving your goal , you will not be\ 
bothered by shallow criticism . In fact nothing important can be\ 
accomplished if you allow yourself to be swayed by some trifling\ 
matter , always looking over your shoulder and wondering what others\ 
are saying or thinking . The key to achievement is to move forward\ 
... resolutely along your chosen path . \ 
Forget not that the earth delights to feel your bare feet\ 
and the winds long to play with your hair . \

Learning how to be kind to ourselves , learning how to respect ourselves , is important .

It is clear that inner peace is the principal cause of happiness . We can observe this in our daily lives . On days when we are calm and happy , even if difficulties arise or we fall victim to a mishap , we take it well , it doesn’t bother us unduly . But on days when we feel sad or have lost our usual calmness , the least little annoyance will take on enormous proportions and be deeply upsetting to us . \

The purpose of a relationship is not to find completion , but to share your completion . Not to find joy , but to share your joy . Not to find happiness , but to share your happiness . ~ Neale < PROPFIRST > Walsch 
“The < PROPFEMALE > does not hoard . The more he helps others , the more he benefits himself , The more he gives to others , the more he gets himself . ” – Lao Tzu 
You may say I'm a dreamer\ 
But I'm not the only one\ 
I hope someday you'll join us\

By life , by love , by < PROPFEMALE > , all good luck comes to me ! The < PROPFEMALE > luck is within me ! Happy St. Pattys Day ! I'll wear green eventhough I'm supposed to wear orange , at least thats what my Aunt tells me ! 
You may find yourself wanting to do all sorts of things that do not bring happiness , just to fill up time somehow . \ 
A fear of boredom kicks in and so one starts chasing all sorts of promises of happiness to the point that one never really comes home to oneself to acknowledge the riches within . \ 
- Lama Shenpen Hookham 
All sentient beings are exactly the same in that every one desires happiness and seeks to avoid misery . We are not isolated entities disconnected from each other . The happiness and suffering of other beings affect us . This mutual relation is obvious . 
Sentient beings have been kind and have benefited us directly and indirectly throughout beginningless time . These beings are intrinsically the same as us in their pursuit of happiness and effort to avoid suffering . Thus , it is essentially logical for us to train in cultivating an impartial attitude wishing for the happiness of all beings . 
Beginningless time .... hmmmm yes .... I like that .... oh oh there goes my brain again ... tick tock tick tock .... hehehehe 
is understanding that just because we're different doesn't mean that one of us is wrong . 
“If you are depressed you are living in the past . \ 
If you are anxious you are living in the future . \ 
If you are at peace you are living in the present . ”\ 
— Lao Tzu 
The pain of one part of humankind is the pain of the whole of humankind . And the human species and the planet Earth are one body . What happens to one part of the body happens to the whole body .

Had an excellent FMR at TVW last night , lots to think about , looking forward to spring equinox and class today , and more to think about , cause ya know how I love to think ! 
When we wish and seek to help others , our attitude is more positive and relationships become easier . We are less afraid and have less anxiety . Otherwise we remain shy and hesitant , and feel the need to take a thousand precautions before we approach people . When our intentions are good , we have greater self-confidence and are stronger . This is how we learn to understand how precious and valuable kindness is . 
This day is a special day , it is yours . \ 
Yesterday slipped away , it cannot be filled anymore with meaning . \ 
About tomorrow nothing is known . \ 
But this day , today , is yours , make use of it . \ 
Today you can make someone happy . \ 
... Today you can help another . \

So if we love someone , we should train in being able to listen . By listening with calm and understanding , we can ease the suffering of another person . \

By being kind to others - if it's done properly , with proper understanding - we benefit as well . So the first point is that we are completely interrelated . What \ 
you do to others , you do to yourself . What you do to yourself , you do to others . \

Treading along in this dreamlike , illusory world , \ 
Without looking for the traces I may have left ;\ 
A cuckoo's song beckons me to return home -\ 
Hearing this , I tilt my head to see\ 
Who has told me to run backwards ;\ 
... But do not ask me where I am heading , \ 
As I travel in this limitless world\ 
Where every step I take is my home . \

No one saves us but ourselves . No one can and no one may . \

is strong and will survive , regaurdless of how stupid and crazy my life has become .... I am above this shit , that is all ..... 
When you begin to touch your heart or let your heart be touched , you begin to discover that it's bottomless , that it doesn't have any resolution , that this heart is huge , vast , and limitless . You begin to discover how much warmth and gentleness is there , as well as how much space . \

Be aware of the contact between your feet and the Earth . Walk as if you are kissing the Earth with your feet . We have caused a lot of damage to the Earth .

One should not imagine oneself to be one with the eye or independent of it or the owner of it . The same with the ear and all the other senses , including the mind . Nor should one imagine oneself to be identical with the world or contained in it or independent of it or the owner of it . \
