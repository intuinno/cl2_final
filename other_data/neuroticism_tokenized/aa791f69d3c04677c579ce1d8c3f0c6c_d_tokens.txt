Spent the last two days wielding a motorized pole and a chain saw . The tree canopy looks fabulous and limbs are off buildings but it will take me a week to drag all of the debris into a pile to burn . Damn I wish I had a bobcat with grapples ! Ahhh - the joys of farm life and being a single woman . Hope I'll be able to move tomorrow ! 
Rewarding myself for all the tree work ( which is still in piles all over my yard ) . Ahh rainy weather and rewards equals wildchild studio time ! OK creative muse - make your appearance - I have much creating to do ! 
A beautifully cool , rainy day in the neighborhood . Muse working in the studio - listening to Jazz Masters II , < PROPFEMALE > Lennox , J.J. Cale , The Eagles and < PROPFEMALE > Kraus . Experimenting with a torch , wood glue , bees wax , and shellac combined in collage with antique emphemera . Cleaned the studio and reorganized - headed for dark beer and wings with 3 of my favorite girlfriends . How do you say it ? LIFE IS GOOD ! 
Blessed are they that are kind to the girls and serve cold beer and spicey wings promptly - for they shall be tipped well ! 
Thank God for a helpful neighbor with a front end loader . He's coming tomorrow to push all the limbs into a pile for burning ... Then its mowing time . After the wood ages a bit I think this opportunity calls for food , music , beer and friends to participate in a huge bonfire at the farm ?

I was so very proud of myself yesterday .. I went to the store to fill up the car and gas cans for lawn equipment when I suddenly looked up and realized it was a BP station .

My son and I just finished cutting sycamore and multiple oak limbs off my house . Then we shoveled and blew years of oak leaves , small limbs and other crap off the roof which we raked into the construction wheel barrow ( 15 loads ) and hauled to the burn pile with all of the limbs we cut .
