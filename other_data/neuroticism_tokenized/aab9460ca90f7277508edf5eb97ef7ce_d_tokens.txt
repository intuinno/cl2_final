Quote of the week : < PROPMALE > Friedman on Fareed Zakaria GPS - the Afghan situation is like \an out of work couple adopting a special needs child\ " - re : the U.S. position going forward in Afghanistan - more and more TV talking heads are pushing for US to get out of there and concentrate on nation building or re-building at HOME !
