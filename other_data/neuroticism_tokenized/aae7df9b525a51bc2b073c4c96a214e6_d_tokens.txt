Sutta : Do not pursue the past . Do not lose yourself in the future . The past no longer is . The future has not yet come . Looking deeply at life as it is . In the very here and now , the practitioner dwells in stability and freedom . vWe must be diligent today . To wait until tomorrow is too late . Death comes unexpectedly . How can we bargain with it ?

They say everlasting friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question the friendship . These types of friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been or how far away they live , and they don't hold grudges . They understand that life is busy , but you will ALWAYS LOVE them .... Re-post if you are blessed to have at least 1 of these friends in your life .
