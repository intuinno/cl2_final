Going to the library today for the new teen writing group ! Yay ~ :] Noon to two .

Every teen that likes writing should come to the writing group at the La Porte County Library ! It's tomorrow , I believe from 5 to 6 . Time was going to possibly change , but since I've heard nothing up to this point , I'd say 5 to 6 . It's loads of fun ( pleasepleasecometherewereonlythreepeoplelasttime ) . 
Math question : \As the number of increments increases 
For all you that will be in the creative writing class next trimester , I believe there's a meeting tomorrow morning . 
Two hour delay :]

Wow . The five-time winner of our Brawl tournaments was just defeated by an unexpected contender , which went on to beat me in the finals . Congrats , < PROPFIRST > . Meanwhile , I continue to convince myself I'm not at all tired , and try to erase the image of two guys grinding up on each other to \My Humps . \ " Interesting night . " 
I don't know who decides this , but apparently Reflections 2010 was ranked the 3rd best [ high school ? ] literary magazine in the state !! Now that's what I'm talking about :D .

Filming two movies tomorrow . All my classes always like to gang up on me at once . 
It was the mustache , señor . 
I can't believe we just filmed that scene . 
And after a really long weekend , our Calculus movie has been completely filmed ! Thanks to everyone who helped , you were all amazing , and the improv style of the movie made it ten times funnier . 
For my Calculus movie , what do you guys like better for the title : \Fight For Calculus City\ " or \ " The Adventures of Derivative Man\ " or \ " Derivative Man ! \"" 
Using the two hour delay to wrap up school projects . Blech . 
Money , you've got lots of friends crowding around your door .
