It was really nice having my girlfriend over for the night . It was night waking up into her eyes and her next to me . ^_^ That was the best new years I ever had . :p 

< PROPMALE > the Cat is quite the interesting movie . o . 0 Never saw that much animated boobies and sex in my life . Well excluding hentai . 
Holy shit .... its 8:16 AM in the morning ... jeebus way too much Lost . 
I just saw Observe and Report . I didn't find it that interesting except for a few funny parts and the fact that < PROPFEMALE > Faris is in it . 
Why is it that we always think about the bad things in life and never the good ? Is it human for us to be the fuck ups of the universe ? And why do we always hurt the ones we love and care for the most ? Just a thought . God damn I think too fucking much . 
Also , we always want to end racism and prejudicism but why do we provoke it all at the same time ? 
So .. its been 9 months with my lovely Angel . HELLS YES !!! /smiles greatly . ^^ Also , Flyleaf's new album is amazing . About time they made it . < PROPFEMALE > Mosley is such a diverse singer and she can belt too . Maybe I could see them for a 4th time in the next year ? Live that is . 
IT ACTUALLY WORKS !!! THE FACEBOOK TRICK : press up , up , down , down , left , right , left , right , B , A , Enter key , then right click(hold it down as you do the next part ) then press up and down and magic circles will appear . the only way to get rid of them are to log off or refresh the page ... IT WILL WORK ! put this as your status if it works it does work 
Why do people hate me so much ? I do nothing wrong that I know of . If I do I would like to know . =/ 
So .... March 9th is when Final Fantasy XIII comes out . I CAN'T WAIT ! 
Well New < PROPFEMALE > was complete shit . The first one was better . Now I'm gonna pray to god they don't fuck up the Gears of War movie whenever it comes out . 
And if the rain stops , and everything's dry She would cry , just so I could drink the tears from her eyes She'd teach my how to fly , even cushion my fall If my engines ever stall , and I plummet from the sky But she would keep me high , and if I ever die She would commission my image on her bosom , to him Or maybe she'd retire as well A match made in Heaven set the fires in Hell 
It really doesn't feel like Wednesday but thats fine . The closer it is to Friday and Monday the better . My gf gets her PS3 so maybe that means more games we can play together online ? I know LBP is going to be a gaurantee . :p But who knows what else ? Also , I'll get my games for my birthday . ^_^ 
Happy thanksgiving to all of you . Now lets eat a bunch of food like turkey and tofurkey . :p ^_^ 
< PROPFEMALE > Trek is by far the coolest movie I saw this year . Thats saying a lot . And why in the hell can't we make layouts for Facebook ? seriously . 
yay ... I'm finally 22 .... 
Do any of you have a PS3 ? If so , add my PSN tag . Its Death Ensemble . I also have ArchieKoRnnoto but I use Death Ensemble more . Add them both or just Death Ensemble . :p

Oh wow ... people just don't know when to stfu do they ? /heads desk . Oh well . I'm glad my girlfriend liked her gifts . ^_^

I just totally beat MW2 today . :p X-play was right . It was short . But others were right it was actually challenging too . 
so I finally saw Lost . It was just one episode but it was pretty cool . 
I loved sledding and snowboarding with my girlfriend . I'm so sore from it though . =/ but it was worth it . :p 
I really how we dream . =/ They're just nothing but pain ... at least in my case . 
I really hate how we dream . They're just nothing but pain ... at least in my case . =/ but I did have a marvelous day with my lovely girlfriend Angel today . ^_^ 
I just spent the last few hours looking at Lost . o . 0 WOOT . 
I just spent the past few hours watching Lost . o . 0 Not a bad show . Good actually . Oh .... and Happy New Year . :p Let the new year of gaming and triumphs begin !! in about 19 hours . o . 0 
I want to learn mapping but I have no idea how I can go by that nor the expenses . If anyone has any ideas ( besides stating the obvious of college or teaching myself ) please let me know . I would like to make a few CS :S maps . 
I feel like the only one who doesn't really care about sports really . I swear I saw so many statuses that involved the NFL . 
damn you MAG beta ! damn you ! =/ I want to play . 
I finally got to play MAG ! The beta anyway . AND ITS FUCKING AWESOME ! I can't wait to play the full version ! Hopefully those connection issues get fixed . =/ 
So if anyone has computers they don't want and willing to part with . Or you need some that needs fixed . Let me know . I wouldn't mind taking them off your hands and/or fixing them . I need the experience . I might or probably will charge depending .

About to go to my grandma's funeral today . =/ 
Damn you DEMOLITION !! DAMN YOU !!!! Great fun but god damn it can be hard . GOD I LOVE MW2 !!! Quickest way to level too . :p 
Sometimes I feel like being a mute is the way to be . =/ 
I miss the show Battlebots . =/ 
I want an eiganharp . =/ 
I sometimes wonder why in gaming , everyone always tries to make it a competition and don't play for fun anymore . =/ It leads to so much bullshit . Making gaming unappealing sometimes I guess you could say . 
I get to wake up next to her again . ^_^ 
It was really nice having my girlfriend over for the night . If only it could happen more often . =/ 
awwww !! such bullshit ! dang you F-1 Championship Edition ! Not letting me pit when I want to ! I had that race one too ! 8 laps to go and I ran out of fuel and it retired me out of a 56 lap race ! SCREW YOU F-1CE ! SCREW YOU ! =/ 
Have you ever had one of those days where you just don't feel like doing anything ? Not even having the motivation to do anything ? =/ 
So , Bad Romance was inspired by Industrial . NEAT !!!! HECK YES ! ^_^ Lady Gaga ftw ! 
I miss my grandma . =/ 
I have a job interview at Wal-mart tomorrow . I hope I get it . 
hopefully , Wal-mart calls me for that second interview ... 
Season 5 of Lost is pretty freaking amazing I must say if I do say so myself . Especially Episode 1 ( Because You Left ) it deals a lot with Time Travel . :p 
woot !! my girlfriend gets to spend the night with me again ! YAY ! ^^ 
I hate how some media makes me think sometimes . In particular Lost . I wish my mom and grandma didn't die . =/ I wish my dad actually gave a shit about me too . The only great thing about my life I feel like is the fact I have an amazing girlfriend named Angel . 
Now finished with seasons 1-5 of Lost . Now for Season 6 to start . RIP < PROPFEMALE > . =/ NO < PROPFEMALE > WHY DID YOU HAVE TO GO !!!!??? /sobs . 
WOO !!! I have a second interview at Wal-mart on Wednesday at 2PM !!! THERE'S STILL HOPE ! ^_^ 
So , I have to go back for a 3rd interview . They said they'll call me at some point . Sounds like to me I have the job but I won't speak so soon . 
Okay . So 3rd interview . Then if I'm offered the position . A drug test . Lets hope I get offered . 
So .. I pretty much have the job . Just got to pass that drug test which I'm sure I will . ^_^

It was nice watching the Superbowl with my gf . Even though I didn't watch any games this season but that as usual . Colts 17 Saints 31 . Decent game though . Now its time for NASCAR to start . :p ^_^ 
So job orientation tomorrow at 9AM . I hate early morning wake ups . At least it'll be worth it .. but tiring . 
Its been one year with Angel today . ^_^ and I have job orientation today . 
Another day at work then hopefully hanging out with Angel afterwards

So if anyone wants my cell phone number . Tell me in a comment and I'll give it to you in a pm . I got one recently . Just give me yours in return in a PM too . lol . 
Why does light beer always test better than regular beer ? and why does malt liquor taste so much better too ? I don't get it . o . 0 
ATTENTION : Has anyone on here bought anything from Newegg.com? How do they ship things , and how long does it take for my order to get to my house , etc and what else do I need to know .

So yeah .. at work today . A couple of Nintendo employees were in the store today . I talked to them . I must say it was pretty fucking epic even though I'm not that big on Nintendo anymore . 
so young and so much more I need and got to learn ... 
after getting this bookcase and organizing everything , I found CDs I forgot I had . Like Lamb of God's Ashes of the Wake for example . :ppp NOW YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO DIE FOR !!!!! /head bangs perfusively . 
The best thing about FF13 so far are its boss battles , its music is pretty amazing too though . and I've also noticed that 3 people I know are getting their hours cut at wal-mart . I really hope that doesn't happen to me . =/ 
Valleys of Neptune by Jimi Hendrix , some of the greatest music and album I've heard in a long ass time . RIP Jimi Hendrix . 
OMG !!!!! OMG OMG OMG OMG !! THE BOONDOCK SAINTS II : ALL SAINTS DAY IS BY FAR ONE OF THE GREATEST MOVIES I EVER SEEN !!! Especially in blu-ray . :p 
So I just totally just built an Angel deck . Now if only I could play more . Angel we should play more . :p I really should buy some more Magic cards and get back into it more . 
god .. I feel like complete shit ....... =/ I hope I feel better . I really don't want to call into work . I need that money . 
I feel like complete shit . and have you ever felt like you done something extremely wrong ? I sure as fuck do . =/ 
god I really suck at puzzles . -_- 
pay day this week = some of my computer upgrades . :p 
yay .. finally beat Resident Evil 3 . 
I say I'll care forever And I mean forever If I have to hold up the sky 
So to try something different , I bought some vegetarian food . Italian sausage isn't bad after getting used to it . Is it strange that I never had the meat counterpart of italian sausage ? I'll have to try that soon . 
Just finished reading War Stories of the Green Berets by < PROPMALE > Halberstadt . Its an incredibly good book . Now I have like 7 or 8 more books to finish . Now time to finish Watchmen . 
Yay early wake up days from not being able to sleep and stuff . At least I'm ordering for some of my comp upgrades .. 
MP3 PLAYER !! YES !!!!!!!! 
How can ignorant can people be ? seriously . 
This MP3 player isn't that bad , its actually a lot better than the other ones I've had . now if only it had more space . =/ 
I want to make a CS :S video . I already have the songs I have in mind I want to use but I don't have video capturing software to use to make it . Does anyone know of any video capturing software thats free ? This excludes Fraps though . 
Holy crap .... Law Abiding Citizen was such a great fucking movie !! One of < PROPFIRST > Foxx's and < PROPMALE > Butler's best movies !

Who games on PC and PS3 ? I need more people to game with . I don't really have anyone to play games with . =/ 
yay for having Jury Duty on April 19th ? =/ 
So .. I just played the PC version of Modern Warfare 2 and I really don't see a difference other than dedicated servers are gone . thats the only complaint . but its still really good I think still the exact same experience I've had as the PS3 version . Now to go to bed so I can go to work in the next 4 1/2 hours 
Its a bit strange how the PC version of MW2 runs so much better than my PC copy of COD4 . I'm betting its because of the lack of dedicated servers for the PC version of MW2 . That will hopefully change and become equal for each of them soon . :P AMD PHENOM II X4 965 FOR YOUR FACE !!!! jk . but seriously . its going to rock .. when I actually buy it this week with my paycheck . 
I wonder if I'll ever be a good dad when the time comes . =/ I don't want to fail like my dad did at it .... 
Gaming makes me feel better . ^_^ Yay FF13 . Once I beat it I really should go back to The Witcher and Bioshock . 
.... can't think of a valid status ... 
I went to my first club yesterday , The Masque . I'm glad I went and it was all the better sharing that moment with my wonderful girlfriend . ^^ 
My girlfriend got me into What Not To Wear . o . 0 lol . its actually not a bad show . strange of me to say that . I wish my upgardes will get here already . =/ 
Smokin ' Aces 2 : Assassin's Ball . That movie could have been a lot better . The first one was far more superior . The nazis/white supremcists were still my favorite characters though . It was more of a disappointment than anything though . =/ Now I want to watch the first one just because it was 10x better . 
its quite apparent I'm developing an obsession with < PROPFEMALE > Bush . Her songs are amazing ! 
HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAH MY COMPUTER UPGRADES ARE IN AND ITS AMAZING !!! /nerdgasm 
Fucking hell . I can't get media sharing to work on my PC to my PS3 and 360 . /pissed off . =/ I'm doing the same thing I've been doing and its still not working . -_- 
Woot ! figured out the problem !!! Yay media sharing on my PS3 again . Now for more < PROPFEMALE > Bush . :p

Doctor Who was amazing tonight . I'm impressed with < PROPMALE > Smith being the new Doctor . It was even more amazing watching it with my beautiful girlfriend . ^^ 
Some day , yeah We'll get it together and we'll get it all done Some day When your head is much lighter Some day , yeah We'll walk in the rays of a beautiful sun Some day When the world is much brighter 
Damn .. these Gears of War shorts are extremely comfy . 
Holy shit .. Raines is a beasty little bastard . o . 0 but yet heals me at the same time . wtf ? o . 0 
Eragon is one of the greatest books I've ever read . That is all . Now to watch the movie to see how much they fucked up on it . 
Damn .... fucking up the book is an understand . I only watched maybe 40 minutes of the fucking movie and realized they took out so much from the book . I couldn't watch it anymore . Such bullshit . =/ Hollywood , I hate you sometimes . Ruining Eragon and shit . =/ 
Avatar is now one of my favorite movies . ^_^ It especially looks great in blu-ray . :p It was sad and beautiful all at the same time . 
Happy mothers day everybody . =/ 
Mother's day is so depressing . =/ ... 
blah ..... 
Ever felt so lonely before ? 
When I couldn't see a future and I was afraid . When the future was\ 
clear and it hurt to see , I just close my eyes and lose myself in\ 
happier days .

So yeah guys . I got kicked out of Sunshine Cafe tonight . Over some stupid bullshit . How great aye ? I really do hope its true that that girl who kicked me out put in her 2 week notice . 
The new As I Lay Dying and the new Bone Thugs N < PROPFEMALE > albums is like a boxer creaming explosion in my pants . :p 
Does anyone have computers they need fixing ? Maybe I can help you out plus I want experience . ^_^ 
RIP < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Dio . You'll be missed . 
Tokyo Gore Police isn't bad the english dubs is stupid though .. < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE>'s Infinite Playlist was a great movie . I'm glad I got to see it . It made me think of her the whole time . Miss you babe . xoxo . =/

Anyone have computers out there that need fixin' ? I need experience . ^_^ 
Omg ! I finally can open my 360 again ! but no live . =/ but my tray is still also iffy too . Payday is this week though .. I shall buy some Live .. :p maybe a 3 month trial .. or maybe a 1 monther or 2 or 3 maybe .. just in case my 360 wants to be a douche again . 
Feels so good to play Forza 2 again . Forza 2 and Deadmau5 ftw !!! ^_^ 
OMG ! Toy Soldiers is such a kick ass game ! I must buy it ! Thankfully I get paid tomorrow . :p XBL and MS points tomorrow . :p

It is official that Christian , < PROPFIRST>'s father , is Lost's version of the G-man . Its quite apparent now .

I finally went to < PROPMALE>'s Island . It was really fun and I actually rode some of the roller coasters too . ^_^ It was great going with Angel . Which made it even better . 
Swimming today was nice . and Angel taught me how to do some flips and handstands in the water . YES !

Why is it that FF13 is the worst game in the series but yet has the best music of the series ? lol . 
ATTENTION ! Does anyone know of ways I can teach myself game design or anyway I can just simply learn for free ? I really should just teach myself it . Then maybe go to college for it later down the road whenever its applicable . 
The Wood , one of my favorite movies of all time . ^ _^ 
Okay ! Why is it that FF13 is the worst game in the series but yet it has one of the best endings in the FF series if not gaming history ?! The same with some of the best music too !! I know contradictory but still DUDE !!! SERIOUSLY !?!!!! Now for Chrono Trigger or one of the earlier FF games maybe .. or one of my 360 RPGs . o . 0

I'm beginning to notice I play a lot more single player games now . o . 0 and also has anyone ever wondered what would have happened if things would have played out differently ? I.E if there was no world wars or if the germans were an ally in both of them , etc . 
Why is it that gamers get shit on so much ? Its bullshit and pisses me off . -_- 
Paranormal Activity 2 was so much better than the first .
