calc is over , is there really any more that needs to be said ? 
12 hours in the studio , good day . 
slightly ticked that the penn state game is not on . 
ciny was put to shame today . new favorite school RPI . 
im truly studying for once hmmmmmmm . it might be part of the reason why i hate mech 
i like how everyone is complaining about how much work they have haha . i do feel kinda bad for pre-med 
i like how each test/ review is set up in perfect stress order . tech was nothing , mech sucks and i need to pull that grade up . then the review i have to show my portfolio to Cuse , Michigan and < PROPMALE > tm , cuz thats not nerve racking . lol 
3.25 does not feel good when ppl in ur class get 3.8 and 4.0 ' s 
its 325$ for a housing deposit at RWU . wtf as if were not paying enough as is 
fun fact ub.edu is not university at buffalo , its university of Barcelona . 
yeaaa cuse , good work boys

one week starts the lax season ! pumped to say the least . 
suck on it Baltimore hahah 
i could see grass 12 hours ago , now my car is buried in snow , legit not moving for a long time . morrisville is a terrible place . 
as of late i have been going to bed early . very uncharacteristic of a architecture student , but after a couple of all nighters i just stayed up until 330 for no real reason . its good to be back 
swat invades mo'ville tm . 
there are times were it only seems like my transfer schools only lose my things .
