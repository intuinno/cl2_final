< PROPFEMALE > and I are probably the only kids in the world who want to go to school tomorrow . Cancelled . 
Just finished watching Defiance . I absolutely love Hebrew History . 
These two days have been great ! Last night work was slow but fast , got a raise , and I didn't have to mop the floors when we closed , and Today I got ten bucks for finding some guy's cell phone at work ! 
Late Start tomorrow . I need to get out of this house ! :( 
Is going to try this thing called sleep once again . Good night everyone . 
My favorite song is very likely \Don't wait for daylight\ " by \ " Need to breathe\ " . -awsome band . " 
coudln't find a hammer . And is hopping that a mallet will be acceptable for Club Oneighty tonight . 
just found himself saying something he never thought he would . Apparently exercise isn't horrible !... never saw that one coming . He also found out that eating bacon for breakfast and hotdogs for supper caused him to sweat pork . -Doesn't plan on repeating the second half . 
thinks he feels that something has just broken so please pray , you know what I am refering to It is as if the time for changes is here But I will wait as long as it takes years or just tomorrow I'll believe it either way I Just have to wait to see it manifest into the physical I didn't go through all that pain for nothing .. Submittance will come , not must come . But will ! All it takes is two on the same note in prayer 
likes not having to clean the floor when you spill something , it seems a dog does have a purpose . 
Apparently there is a sale at Fareway ending today ... I am so glad my five hours are finally finished ! :) 
never seemed to realize how comfortable his school classroom's floor is . But now having slept the last few hours , it is time to see if he can salvage a night for school work , just two lessons , two quizes and one Test till he can leave . -This may be a while . :) 
is enjoying watching his mom's phoofou dog ( < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Cavalier Cocker Spaniel < PROPFEMALE > ) just staring at a bone half her size , she is wagging her tail and I think she is pretty happy . 
just went into the kitchen to smell gas , someone must have bumped the stove . -thank you God ! Its a good thing I didn't get scheduled to work any earlier than noon because I'd be gone , and soon my house may have too , not to mention a dog and three cats .. though I'd only be upset about two of them , especially < PROPMALE > , who eats all the bugs , flies , and kills all the bats . 
So < PROPFEMALE > just told me I look like Great Grandpa < PROPMALE > in my khakies and new shirt , .. she also knows that I take that as a compliment .. though .. she doesn't think dressing in an eighty two year old's apparel is great .. but that's my style ! :) 
just loves reading Hamlet .. I mean the ability to follow what is happening is just so smooth and easy to follow .. good thing for me they made a movie in 1948 , I just have to watch the right side of my screen to see and hear what is happening .. and read the left side of my screen to understand all the words . -I really like the internet sometimes . :) 
is in Niagra Falls . 
so < PROPFEMALE > ( whom doesn't need to loose weight ) , decides to do three days of eating just apples . -She made it till 12:30 , day one . 
was just looking into the meaning of his name , and has never put it fully together till now ... I find this interesting . \ 
Copple : is a dweller at a peaked hill . \ 
Gordon : the peaked hill contains a [ large ( fortification )] near the ( meadows ) . \ 
< PROPFIRST > is either [ light or dark ] . \ 
I see things in black or white , ( while peering into confusion ) , seeking to know the simple answer . This is where I dwell . 
Extraversion : the extent to which you enjoy company , seek \ 
excitement and stimulation . 0.4% have a \ 
lower extraversion raw percentage than yours . From the way you answered \ 
the questions , you seem to describe yourself as someone who is quiet and\ 
somewhat withdrawn . Your answers describe you as someone who doesn't \ 
need lots of other people around to have FUN , AND CAN SOMETIMES FIND THAT PEOPLE ARE TIRING ... so true . 
A 934 < PROPFEMALE > book just made me a very happy boy . \ 
< PROPFIRST > Washington Sacred Fire . 
Ray : \I need to get a facebook page\ " 
has the most amazing sister in the whole wide world ! Love you < PROPFEMALE > Copple :) 
nothing like college algebra to make an individual feel like the dumbest person in the world :( 
A teacher addresses her class , and asks :\ 
Can you see God ? \ 
The class responds \No\ " . \ 
Is officially the < PROPMALE > at being the worst solitaire player ever ! No moves left to do ... 57 seconds ... 
Another shop lifter at work tonight ... Its kind of funny , how a person thinks they can just drop stuff into bag big enough to fill half a cart load ... and no one would notice ;) 
Grandpa : When i was your age my momma would send me \ 
down to the store with $1 and I would come back with 5 bags of potatoes 2\ 
loaves of bread , 3 bottles of milk a box of tea and 6 eggs but you cant\ 
do that these days to many stupid security cameras

Most people have 1000 wishes for Christmas ; a cancer patient only has one , to get better . I know 97% of you won't re-post this to your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do . In honor of someone who has died , or is still fighting , or survived cancer , copy this to your status . 
is pondering how long his sanity will last ; now that his sisters have no school for the following two weeks ... ~ Maybe I should find some way to disarm the T.V. of temporary use ? and hide < PROPFIRST>'s drum sticks ... or better yet , use them as her alarm clock ; with my rhythm and coordination < PROPFIRST > won't even know the difference ... jk ... kinda ... 
Is hoping that recovery from the extraction of his wisdom teeth will be short . \ 
I can't wait until I \can\ " \ " close my mouth\ " further than just my two front teeth having a semblance of touching . On the other hand 
Thinks its funny how the the fat people role in WALL-E ! ;) 
wants Christmas to stop hiding ; the Christmas junk food to Disappear !... and the \ 
presents under the Christmas tree to stop mocking him ! 
Is now officially done with school until mid January ! :-]

Likes driving a pickup truck a heck of a lot more then his Bonneville . :D \ 
To bad it'll only be a week till my car's fixed , but that's life . \ 
Good news is I don't drive like my sister , \ 
& I tested the brakes a half a block before the stop sign . \ 
If I hadn't I'd have bumbled right into Lakeport ... bye bye me :)

:) 
TODAY ROCKED !!! \ 
Although < PROPFIRST > WolfPack Jessen may be a little sore with me ;) \ 
Considering I hit him ... in a not so pleasant spot . \ 
:P 
sadly paint balling is over ... :( \ 
A few hours have passed , and I definitely\ 
could go for a few more rounds ! \ 
I'm definitely doing it again ! 
sounds like its going to rain ... time for a bike ride ! :D 
But the ones that fell on the good ground are those who , having heard the word with a < PROPMALE > and good heart , keep it and bear fruit with patience . \ 
< PROPMALE > 8:15 
I hope I shall possess firmness and virtue enough to maintain what I consider the most enviable of all titles , the character of an honest man . \ 
< PROPFIRST > Washington 
thunder storm ... heck ya ! \ 
love this weather :D 
We should not look back unless it is to derive useful lessons from past errors , and for the purpose of profiting by dearly bought experience . \ 
< PROPFIRST > Washington\ 
\ 
-If past actions are clearly bought , I just ponder why people are so negligent in their every day lives when they ought to be living by The High Standard ... just a thought . 
It seems just about nothing makes me happier than finding the perfect gift . And knowing they absolutely love it is another plus . Another gift slam dunked :D \ 
p.s. Happy Early Birthday < PROPFIRST > Way , Enjoy your last day of being eighteen . :) 
Sugar and me have a bitter sweet relationship ... part of me would just like to bite off his head n ' the other part ... hay weight , I mean wait , oh ya ... there's that bitter side . 
tis the season of being pulled over :( \ 
grrr ! 
Paint balling Saturday ... YES !!!! 
Sow for yourselves righteousness ;\ 
Reap in mercy ;\ 
Break up your fallow ground , \ 
For it is time to seek the Lord , \ 
Till He comes and rains righteousness\ 
on you . \

a black man walks to a bar . a white man says : \colored people are not allowed in here . \ " the black man says : \ " when i'm born i'm black ; when i'm cold i'm black ; when i'm sick i'm black and when i'm dead i'm black ! but when you're born you're pink ; when you're cold you're blue ; when you're sick you're green and when you're dead you're purple ! yet you have the nerve to call me colored ?! \"" 
< PROPFEMALE > is looking through pictures for her senior slide show , : \I was such a nerd 
Let's be clear on this : OBAMA did NOT kill Bin Laden . An American soldier(who Obama just a few weeks ago was debating on whether or not to PAY ) did . Obama just happened to be the one in office when our soldiers finally found OBL and took him out . This is NOT an Obama victory , but an AMERICAN victory !! RE-POST IF YOU AGREE !!! 
The awkward moment when a fat kid says \that's how I role \"." 
\Girls may just want to have fun 
Is watching < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > and his now old buddies eat ousters , Night crawlers , stink bait , cat food , dog food ( liver flavored ) , live gold fish ( 6 each ) . Then burp the abc's ... 
After school ends I really want to go fishing ! Anyone know a good spot for catfish or bullheads ? Preferably a nice size pond . I used to go to one with my Grandpa , but it dried up a few years ago . Since then its been browns lake ... I'd like something knew . \ 
Almost nothing tastes as good as fried catfish :P
