Now all those feelings , those yesterdays feelings will all be lost in time but today I've wasted away for today is on my mind <3 
One of the hardest things in life is having words in your heart that you can't utter . 
Teaching my dad how to use his very first cell phone ! This may take a while ..... haha 
Listening to too much Owl City . But I love him now :) 
I'd like to make myself believe , that planet Earth turns slowly . It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep , because my dreams are bursting at the seams . 
Blah . I need a vacation . And I feel sick :/ 
I wish some people would stop treating me like a child . I can take care of myself . Thanks . 
Sooo glad that Conan will be okay :) I love him too much

Good luck tonight Twins <3 
So today when I was getting my eyebrows waxed from one of the prettiest girls I've ever seen , she told me that I had a really pretty face . By far the best compliment ever :)

Does anyone know of any friends or family who are dental hygienists ? I have to interview a dental hygieniest for my Bio II class by tomorrow and so far , no luck :/ 
Work from 12-4 and then it's off to A-1 for my bridge piercing hopefully ! :) 
Grrrrrrr 
Sometimes feels like just giving up .... Music seems to be the only thing that gets me through the day 
Without it all I'm choking on nothing , it's clear in my head and I'm screaming for something , knowing nothing is better than knowing it all 
Feels like cuddling up with some cocoa and a blanket and watching a horror movie :) 
I don't want to shove my beliefs in your face .... but whether you're vegetarian or not , you have to admit this is completely wrong and unethical . I'm taking the pledge of not buying any Land O ' Lakes products until they fix these problems for good . Watch the video from this link and see for yourself . It's pretty disturbing . https://secure.peta.org/site/Advocacy?cmd=display&page=UserAction&id=2515 
Got my Berth dvd in the mail !! Yay ! I love you < PROPFIRST > Allman :) 
No bridge piercing :/ The risk of it rejecting is too high . Might go get my eyebrow pierced instead ? 
Got my eyebrow piercing .... love it :) 
Work on my only day off :/ need the money though 
Work tonight , tomorrow , Sunday and Monday blahh . Gonna save up my money for a car though ... preferably a Toyota Camry :) 
Waiting is painful . Forgetting is painful . But not knowing which to do is the worst kind of suffering- Paulo Coelho 
Wow I just don't know anymore . There is only one person in my life who truly knows how I feel and actually cares . 
Going into work early today ..... as if I don't work long enough as it is -__- 
Looooong day . Now paper :/

Bought my beautiful PS3 today . Estoy feliz . Watching Youtube videos on it is like 10x better :) 
Showerrrr then sleeeep :) Then buying some PS3 games tomorrow ! :) 
All I can say is that my life is pretty plain , I like watchin ' the puddles gather rain . And all I can do is just pour some tea for two , and speak my point of view but it's not sane , it's not sane 
This is the part where you are supposed to scream 
Went to the mall and spent money I shouldn't have .... but had fun regardless :) 
People tried to break into my dad's car again at 2am but they didn't get very far this time cause my brother heard and went out and chased and cursed them out . I'd like to see you try breaking into my dad's car again :) Haha stupid people . 
It's really amazing when two strangers become the best of friends , but it's really sad when the best of friends become two strangers . 
Wow ... I don't have anyone anymore . Senior year is officially the WORST year of my life . And it's all downhill from here . 
Hanging out with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > :)

In a good mood :) I'm sure work will change that ... haha 
Got my Pierce The Veil CD in the mail today :) 
Screw you . 
Finally seeing < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE>'s This Is It today :) 
It is easy to hate and it is difficult to love . This is how the whole scheme of things works . All good things are difficult to achieve , and bad things are very easy to get . 
Mmm .... Pretty sure I could live off of Spumoni :) 
Kamehameha Aghh stuck in my head ! :) 
Wow ... can I move out soon ? 
Boys are stupid . The end .

Ouch . 
About to get yelled at tomorrow .... yay ... 
Lost five pounds ! :) 
Can't stop laughing :) 
:/ 
It's funny how I can love life yet hate it at the same time ... hmm .. 
I've learned that things change , people change , and it doesn't mean you forget the past or try to cover it up . It simply means you move on and treasure the memories . Letting go doesn't mean giving up , it means accepting that some things weren't meant to be . 
Just leave me out of your life for good . But I don't really have to tell you that since you already did . 
Te vas no me dices < PROPFEMALE > Que pasa que ya no te veoooo 
Got off work early ... Now what to do :) 
I could really go for some Caribou right about now :)

Watching < PROPMALE > of Queens :) 
Go to urbandictionary.com, type in your first name , copy and paste this as your status , and put the first entry for your name under comments . 
After crying myself to sleep last night , I wake up alone . 
I just don't wanna do anything anymore .

Thanks for the New York style cheesecake you left in my fridge Kackada ! Ahaha :) 
He has me hooked on Mountain Dew <3 
This Brave New World book is so boring I think I may just stab my eyes out .

I love how < PROPFIRST > says he hates getting gifts yet I catch him snooping in my purse looking for his gift ahaha :) 
I don't know where I'm going in life or what I'm going to do , but I do know who I want in it , and that's all that matters . 
Sometimes I don't know when to shut my mouth . 
Time to catch some Zzz's :) 
I like starting off my day to some Owl City :) 
Yawning like craaaaazy . Time for some sleep :)

Don't be so desperate and jealous . It's quite annoying . 
Why does there have to be pros and cons to everything ? 
Going to the mall with Lindsay .... and I have two things on the mind ... Victoria's Secret and Chipotle :) 
Stuck at my house bored out of my mind 
\Tigers love pepper ! They hate cinnamon\ " Haha greeeeat movie :) " 
One day down .... three more to go :/ 
It's not always rainbows and butterflies , it's compromise that moves us along . My heart is full and my door's always open , you can come anytime you want 
Not feelin ' so hot :/ 
Might get some Pha ? I think that's how you spell it ... lol 
I believe the sun shouldn't set on an argument . 
Watching a movie alone :/ That's almost as bad as DiGiorno For One haha 
Work 1-7 . Just what I need to make my day go from bad to worse . 
Doing your best means never stop trying . 
I know you'll regret this . I'm a good person and you're missing out . 
Work 5-midnight 
I need a new job .... A job that doesn't have to deal with people :) 
What am I supposed to do when the best part of me was always you , and what am I supposed to say when I'm all choked up that you're ok . I'm fallin ' to pieces , yeah , I'm fallin ' to pieces 
Spare me the whole \Plenty of fish in the sea\ " talk k ? I don't want THOSE fish . I only want this one . " 
Sometimes you just need to be with the person who makes you smile , even if it means waiting . 
I love him more than anything and I just want things to work out :/ 
Haha Pineapple Express never gets old :) 
Every single day , I think about how we came all this way . The sleepless nights and and the tears you cried . It's never too late to make it right . 
Well ... apparently I'm only getting $32 for my federal return ? WTF ! Something isn't right .... 
In the mood for some DBZ :) 
Hanging out with < PROPFIRST > Squeak Xyooj :) 
Shower , sleep , and dream . 
I just hate life right now :/ 
Gonna go get my nose pierced :) 
No school and I'm up too early ... damn sleep schedule 
Time for some much needed sleep 
Damn girl scouts and their delicious Samoas .... I couldn't resist :) 
Work . My least favorite word . 
:: Ring Ring :: \Immigration ! \ " Haha good times at work :) " 
\I had a pet rock but then it attacked my friend so we had to put it down \"- < PROPMALE > Sparks Haha VH1's I love the 70's " 
loves how customers try to tell you how to do your job . Then you prove them wrong and they feel like dumbasses :) 
Had my first piece of meat in over six months ... I feel like a failure lol 
Wow ... I just don't know . You truly care and love someone and they screw you over . Thanks . 
Walking to the store alone ... have too much on my mind ... need to get out of this house 
needs to sleep so my mind will stop wandering . 
I'm only 18 and already I've got too many problems 
Michigan sounds really good right now .. 
Did I make it that easy to walk right in and out of my life ? Goodbye my almost lover . Goodbye my hopeless dream . I'm trying not to think about you . Can't you just let me be ? So long my luckless romance . My back is turned on you . Should've known you'd bring me heartache , almost lovers always do .

Hanging out with < PROPFIRST > Knoll , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > , and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > today :) 
Finally watched Toy Story 3 .... Where is RC !? :/ 
Whatever .. 
Wow ... Apple couldn't come out with an iPod touch with HD video recording TWO years ago ? No matter what you buy , something better will always come out eventually .... Grr 
Watching Miami Ink . I've always thought it would be really cool to be a tattoo artist ... too bad I can't draw to save my life ha 
All the lives , always tempted to trade . Will they hate me for all the choices I've made ? Will they stop when they see me again ? I can't stop .. now I know who I am 
Later today I'll be on my way to < PROPFIRST > Town for the weekend :D 
Haha no snow in Chicago yet suckers :P 
Boyfriend bought me Avenged Sevenfold tickets for February 1st ! He must reaaaaally like me :) Already saw A7X twice in concert and still haven't met them ... third times a charm , right ? ;) 
Rain rain go away 
I don't wanna leave Chicago :/ Oh well ... it'll be my new home in 2011 :) 
Honestly ... do people have any respect at all ? Grr .. 
im a pants pooper 
Soo ... who wants to be extra generous this Christmas and buy me a Toyota Camry or Honda Civic ? Any takers ? :) 
FINALLY bought myself a Wii ... time to kick my boyfriend's butt in some < PROPFIRST > Kart muahahaha 
Nintendo Wii is making me become a couch potato . Hmm .... better buy Wii Fit haha 
MOA with < PROPFIRST > Knoll <3 
Hmm .. What's my Christmas tradition ? Watching A Christmas Story every year . That movie NEVERRR gets old 
Why are Slater from Dazed and Confused and < PROPMALE > Silver from Pineapple Express < PROPFEMALE > cute ? 
Time to not eat anything for the next few days haha ... I had < PROPFEMALE > much good food today ! 
Hmm ... go work out/tan after work or be lazy and watch a movie ? Ha decisions decisions .. 
Eew I'm too pale . Tanning and working out tonight for sure .. 
The thought of waking up early tomorrow for work makes me sad :/ Haha . Time for some sleep .. 
I hate mornings . 
I've been neglecting my body lately , so I think it's time for some routine/daily pilates . Oh , and no junk food whatsoever . Let's hope I can do it ha . 
No work tomorrow which means I'll have a little extra time with my two best friends ... My bed and my pillow :) 
I love the movie Blow , but < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > is just too beautiful ! 
February 1st is coming up quick ... Get to see sexy Avenged Sevenfold in Chicago for the third time :D with my sexy boyfriend ;) 
Has an over-the-phone interview tomorrow with the Lowe's in Northbrook , Illinois ! Yay ! So glad this transfer might work out :) 
Don't leave your hair straightener on around a curious puppy ... he may just pee on it ... ughh 
People just suck in general ... 
Second interview with the Northbrook , Illinois Lowe's went pretty well I think ... I'm excited :D 
Ugh I hate hiccups .. 
I did a couple extra minutes than my regular tanning time and it comes back to bite me in the butt ... Now I look sunburned in the middle of winter ? Greaaat . 
Packing is so time consuming .... And Facebook is too distracting ... 
Award shows for celebrities are a joke .... Let's give already privileged people a trophy for being in movies and on tv ... The fame and fortune aren't enough ? 
March 22nd = The Stroke's fourth album :D 
Just to make things clear ... when I move to Chicago , I will NOT be a White Sox fan ... It's all about the Minnesota Twins :) < PROPFIRST > Mauer and < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > baby <3 <3 
Getting my hair cut and dyed ... Let's hope it turns out okay :) 
\It's winter time ... time to get fat ! Except I wouldn't recommend it for you ladies ... you think it's cold when you're skinny ? Imagine sleeping alone .. \ " -Tosh . 0 Haha " 
Watching Freaks and Geeks ... haven't seen this show in foreverrr 
A hot shower sounds really good right about now ... I'm freezing ! 
I can't believe I'm saying this but I might actually miss my job the most about Minnesota lol . Oh well , Chicago here I come .. 
Food tastes so different in Chicago ... the fries at Burger < PROPMALE > are so different from the ones in Minnesota ... so sad that I know the difference ... Haha 
Going to Lowe's in Northbrook today ... busy , busy , busy 
Finally had Baskin Robins for the first time in my life :) Lol . 
Probably not going to Avenged Sevenfold tonight now .. Thanks a lot , stupid blizzard . 
Making steak tonight .... who wants to come over ? :D 
B Dubs and UFC tonight with < PROPMALE > Lawrie and Herf Yamaya :) 
I never liked < PROPFEMALE > Aguilera anyways .... There's no need to lengthen every single note you sing . You should probably get the words right though ....... 
Stuck in Wisconsin till 1pm .... crazy Packer fans ...... 
Facebook was distracting when I was in school and now it's distracting when I should be job searching .... Haha 
It's absolutely beautiful outside . I couldn't ask for better weather :) 
Why oh why does Lollapalooza have to cost $200 ? :/ 
Job searching and doing taxes ... soooo much fun 
Watching Dumb and Dumber and making a pizza with the bf ... a good night :) 
Chicago Pizza : You taste so good ... but you're so bad for me ! 
I could REALLY go for a caramel cooler right now ... 
It's only been a month and I already miss Minnesota ... lol 
What am I doing tonight ? Watching Tosh . 0 and the Roast of < PROPFIRST > Trump :) 
Going to Woodfield Mall without any $$$ = Pure torture 
UFC :) 
Women are crazy . Men are stupid . Women are crazy because men are stupid :) 
My Minnesota Twins play April 1st and I can't even watch it >:( Pshh like I'd ever watch the stupid White Sox :P 
It is too early to be awake ..... I miss my bed already 
We're all the same and love is blind .... The Sun is gone before it shines 
Why does all the bad stuff have to happen all at once ?.. 
I got a call from a job I applied to but I have no idea what the lady said it was for .... Crossing my fingers for Toyota :D 
Watchin my Twin's :) Mauer is still sexy as ever :) 
Lexus interview at 10 ... Aghh so nervous 
Working 10-4 at Lowe's and 6:30 -2am at AE . Let the work day begin :/ 
I've been working more than I've been sleeping .... NOT a good combo ... 
I miss my job and everything back in Sota ... I can't adapt to change very well ... 
Work 7-3 , Ca$h check , < PROPMALE>'s birthday party , and no work tomorrow ... Ohh yeah :) 
Mauer on the disabled list !? Noooo :/ 
Isn't it just lovely when a girl flirts with your boyfriend when you're only 3ft away ? Pretty sure he's with me hun ... But nice try :) 
\There should be a rule to not have food delivered when the place you ordered from is in sight \"- < PROPMALE > Lawrie haha " 
9-6 shifts go soooo slow . I want my bed :/ 
Is there such a thing as feeling happy and miserable at the same time ? Stupid emotions ... 
Moving back to Minnesota May 2nd . Only temporarily . Chicago has grown on me :) 
Don't ever sign up at Anytime Fitness . Especially the West St. < PROPFIRST > location . < PROPMALE > , the \manager\ " is a complete jerk and douche bag . " 
Bdubs and UFC tonight ... Doesn't get any better than this :) 
On my way back to Minnesota :/ I'll be back soon Chicago :) 
Hanging out with the lovely < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > :) 
I love how you don't find out your pants are ripped until AFTER you're already in public . Such a wonderful start to my day ... 
And I thought not going to the mall would save me money .... Then I remembered there's online shopping ... Haha 
I actually don't mind working now ... It makes me that much closer to finally getting my car :D 
Oh man , I really need one of those UFC punching bags to let off some steam ... 
Just saw a lady scratch her butt from the INSIDE of her pants ... Keeps work ... Interesting 
If you stand for nothing , you'll fall for anything . 
This is the moment I've been waiting for the past 7 days ... I get to go to sleep tonight and wake up tomorrow whenever I feel like it :) 
I hate looking for the \right\ " school for me ... I think I hate looking at what I'll have to pay even more ... " 
It's a beautiful Sunday and I'm stuck at work all day ... No surprise there 
Hahaha \Motley Lue \"" 
Had a customer today that asked me specific questions about the AA batteries ... I'm a cashier ... NOT a battery expert .... Just buy the freakin batteries ..... geeze 
Saving money has been surprisingly easy . Can't wait to be driving my Honda Crv soon ! AND can't wait to get my half sleeve this summer !! :) 
Two tank tops , three shirts , and one pair of capris all for $60 . I'd say shopping today was a success :D 
Perfect day for a walk ... My pale skin needs to see some sun lol 
< PROPFIRST > Weiland on < PROPFIRST > Leno tonight ... yay ! :)

Gonna < PROPFEMALE > out with the lovely < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > :) 
Missing UFC tonight thanks to work ... Ugh ... Hate closing shifts 
Work soon .... Where else would I be ? 
It always seems like a good decision at the time to stay up late ... But I know my body is gonna hate me in the morning when I have to get up for work haha ... 
That's so funny the last time I laughed at that , I laughed so hard .. I FELL OFF MY DINOSAUR !
