Long in the tooth but harmless as can be\ 
Lord I guess he's doin alright\

I know the sun's still shinin when I close my eyes \ 
There's some hard times in the neigborhood \ 
But why can't every day be just this good ? 
Just when I start thinking it's as good as it can get , This crazy life does something just to let me know , I haven’t seen anything yet ......

sometimes i wish life had a redo button but it doesn't and you can't live in the past its not worth it so forgive and forget no matter what it is 
Look at me , And tell me , You don’t love me , Take my hand and say , It can’t be , Kiss me once and just , Before you walk away , Listen first to what , Your senses say\ 
‘Cause I can see me , Loving you forever , I can feel my arms , Around your life , I can taste your lips , Against my memory , Listen to your senses , What they have to say 
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do\ 
Two can be as bad as one\ 
It's the loneliest number since the number one\ 
No is the saddest experience you'll ever know\ 
Yes , it's the saddest experience you'll ever know

Sooo happy i don't have to hear about the US soccer team anymore 
i don't give a damn what other people say what do you think about that ? 
I'm not afraid to take a stand , \ 
Everybody come take my hand , \ 
We’ll walk this road together , through the storm \ 
Whatever weather , cold or warm \ 
Just let'n you know that , you're not alone \ 
Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road 
I've known it from the moment that we met \ 
No doubt in my mind where you belong \ 
I'd go hungry , I'd go blind for you \ 
I'd go crawling down the aisle for you \ 
There ain't nothing that I wouldn't do \ 
To make you feel my love 
I got my toes in the water , ass in the sand\ 
Not a worry in the world , a cold beer in my hand\ 
Life is good today . Life is good today . 
Do you love me ? Do you want to be my friend ? And if you do . Well\ 
then don`t be afraid to take me by the hand , If you want to . I think\ 
this is how love goes Check Yes or No . 
Well if it's lovin ' you want well I've got it\ 
If it's money you want the I'll get it\ 
I'll buy you tall , tall trees and all the waters in the seas\ 
I'm a fool , fool , fool for you 
Baby run cut a path across the blue skies\ 
Straight in a straight line you can't get here fast enough\ 
Find a truck and fire it up < PROPFEMALE > on the gas and off the clutch\ 
Leave < PROPFIRST > in the dust I need you in a rush\ 
So baby run 
Well you can't help but wonder why you can't help but love her\ 
But you can't help but love her\ 
And all that hurtin was more than worth it\ 
It's written all over your face 
My daddy spent his life lookin ' up at the sky\ 
He'd cuss , kick the dust , sayin ' son it's way too dry\ 
It clouds up in the city , the weather man complains\ 
But where I come from , rain is a good thing 
Just got back from an amazing adventure that included going to shady < PROPFEMALE > with < PROPFIRST > Rimback and < PROPFIRST > Whelan awesome 
Praise the Lord for the rain to make the grass grow i love rain soooooo much right now 
Oh my my this here Anakin guy\ 
May be Vader someday later - now he's just a small fry\ 
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye\ 
Sayin ' \Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi\ " \ 
The longer I live the more I believe , You do have to give if you wanna recieve . There's a time to listen , a time to talk , And you might have to crawl even after you walk Had sure things blow up in my face Seen the longshot , win the race Been knocked down by the slamming door Picked myself up and came back for more 
Just Hold On Loosely , but don't let go , If you cling to tightly , \ 
you're gonna lose control , Your baby needs someone to believe in\ 
And a whole lot of space to breathe in 
I have come to the conclusion that i absolutely hate pine trees with a burning passion because they are stupid and pointless the only thing they are good for are christmas trees 
PLUTO IS A PLANET !!!!!!!!!!! 1 
You won't be my judge because my judge will judge us all one day you do your thing i'll do mine 
Too much fun what's that mean\ 
It's I like too much money there's no such thing\ 
It's like a girl too pretty with too much class\ 
Being too lucky a car too fast\ 
No matter what they say I've done\ 
Well I ain't never had too much fun 
But there's nothing wrong with a hard hat and a hammer\ 
Kind of glue that sticks this world together\ 
Hands of steel and cradle of the Promised Land\ 
God bless the working man 
I love thunderstorms :) 
I have the bestest best friend in the whole wide world aka(Sammie Rimback ) 
Winter gettin ' colder , summer gettin ' warmer\

Don't let the sun go down on me\ 
Although I search myself , it's always someone else I see\ 
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free\ 
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me 
why do we have to grow up ?

These types of friends pick up like they spoke just yesterday , regardless of how long it has been or how far away they live . And , they don't hold grudges . They understand that life is busy , but you will always love them . ~ Re-post if you have at least 1 of these friends 
you find out who your friends are
