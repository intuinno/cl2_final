honesty is overrated most people lie even when they say they are telling the truth especially when it comes to certain matters just sayin !!!!!!!!!! 
This week we remember all babies born sleeping , or whom we have carried but never met , or those we have held but could not take home , or the ones that came home but didn't stay . Make this your profile status , if you or someone you know has suffered the loss of a baby . The majority won't do it , because unlike cancer , baby loss is still a taboo subject . Break the silence . In memory of Zebedee < PROPMALE > Matthies -- 9/10/2007 
GO PACK GO !!!!!!!!!!! CONGRATS TO JORDY < PROPMALE > AND THE REST OF THE PACKERS !!!!!!!!!!!! 
At 4:36 this moring a beautiful baby girl named Maliah was born into our wonderful family i cant wait to meet her in person !!!!!!!! Congrats < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > i love yall !!! 
I have a personal reason for ASKING if everyone could please put this as their status . I know my family will . Think of someone you know or love who has had cancer . My prayer is that in 2011 a cure will be found . Do it for all of us . There are too many to mention who have fought and are fighting . I hope to see this in the status of all my friends . 
Someone will get this right ! My middle name__________ , my age___ , my favorite soda_______ , my full birthday___/___/___ , whose the love of my life______ , my best friend_____ , my favorite color______ , my eye color_______ , my true hair color______ my favorite food________and my moms name__________ !!! Put this as your status and see who knows you best 
Sibling war ! Copy & Paste this if you are the best & smartest of your siblings . If it stands for one hour without your siblings protesting , it is so !! 
Had an amazing time at the camp family weekend it was great to see everyone and the new campground now just cant wait till camp !!!!!
