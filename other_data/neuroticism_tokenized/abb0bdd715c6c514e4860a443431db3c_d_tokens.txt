I've just been PokeGear'd by < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > . 

Just got the Humble Indie Bundle . It's awesome ! You get to pay whatever you want for 5 games , and the money goes to the developers and Child's Play ( a video game < PROPFEMALE > ) . Please consider buying it ! :) 
I am TOTALLY FINISHED WITH MATH ! I finished my MA110 final yesterday afternoon , so I've got all my math credits ! YESSSSSSSSSSS ! 
I submitted my philosophy paper today , so that means I'm officially finished with all my courses ! Summer internship , here I come ! 
I started playing Astro Boy : < PROPFEMALE > Factor again . I didn't care for it much at first back when I got it a few years ago , but I'm glad I tried it out again ; it's challenging and fun ! The boss fights are especially awesome , and the story is charming . 
I might go to GameStop this week to get a DS game for the 8-hour car ride from < PROPFEMALE > to Massachusetts ( and for the ride back as well ) . I'm going to use my EDGE card , so it'll have to be a used game . I'm thinking something like Fire Emblem or Professor Layton would be good since they're easily playable in a moving vehicle . Any other suggestions ? 
SUPER < PROPFIRST > GALAXY 2 . SUPER < PROPFIRST > GALAXY 2 . SUPER < PROPFIRST > GALAXY 2 . ( It arrived in the mail today . If you don't have it already , order it from Amazon ; you will get a $20 credit towards your next video game purchase . ) 
I have confirmed that < PROPFEMALE>'s is superior to McDonald's ( at least in terms of burgers ) . I'm a health nut , but I decided to try one of those famous square-patty burgers . It was great ! I'm not sure how much healthier their burgers are , but they seem fresher . So if you're reading this , < PROPFEMALE > , that was free advertising ; I'll be expecting a \reward\ " of sorts ( preferably money ) . " 
I haven't seen this movie yet , but I must say that < PROPMALE>'s hair is pretty . 
Looking up people from my past ( friends and enemies alike ) on Facebook leaves me feeling rather ... melancholy . Ever since moving back to < PROPFEMALE > , I've been wondering what the people in my life from years ago are now like . I don't know why , but it's just such an odd feeling ... 
Which Pokémon do I remind you most of ? Post your responses ! 
If anyone has a request/suggestion of what character ( video game , anime , etc . ) they'd like for me to try and make in Illustrator , let me hear it ! :) 
I'm currently playing FrontierVille for my internship duties . If anyone wants to join me , please do ! 
Microsoft's E3 press conference is in 5 minutes ! Booyah ! 
Waiting for Nintendo's < PROPFEMALE > announcement today ... 
I think we can all agree that Nintendo won the show this year . 
I cannot say this enough : Nintendo is amazing . I haven't been this excited in a long time . The 3DS is revolutionary ! You do not need 3D glasses to see the images popping out at you from the screen . The future is now , people ! 
I just beat Super < PROPFIRST > Galaxy 2 ! I got every Power < PROPFEMALE > that's possible to get ( 105 ) before challenging Bowser . Now I'm off to get the remaining stars ! :D 
I spent a good portion of my day playing more Super < PROPFIRST > Galaxy 2 , and now I'm up to 120 Power Stars ! Apparently , this is the point where I go after the \cosmic jewels . \"" 
SMG2 update : I got all the Green < PROPFEMALE > s in World S ! The first one I got was Green < PROPFEMALE > 1 in World 1 , but I decided to go backwards since I was unable to find Green < PROPFEMALE > 2 in that World . It's easier to find the Green < PROPFEMALE > s in World S , even though the galaxies there are more difficult ; the obstacles are harder , but it's easier to scope out the Green < PROPFEMALE > s since they have less places to hide . 
Just got Sonic 1 , 2 , 3 and Knuckles on XBLA today . They're having a special discount today only , so make sure to get them if you don't have them already ! 
I managed to get all 200 Achievement Points in Sonic the Hedgehog 3 today ! Now I just have to work on the Achievements for Sonic 1 , 2 and Knuckles . 
Samson jumped up onto my lap and sat there for , like , 20-30 minutes . He purred softly and would occasionally turn his head to stare at me with those wide blue eyes of his . He and Magic make me so happy . :) <3 
I finally came up with a cosplay idea ! If I go to Otakon and manage to get the supplies , it'll be AWESOME !!! 
Hey everybody , I gots me a wife ! :D ( In FrontierVille . ) 
Watch out for the AV Security Suite malware ! I just got infected today and spent a large portion of time using various programs to scan my entire computer . AV Security Suite is a fake antivirus program that tells you that your computer is infected , though it's a lie . Fucking selfish assholes ... \ 
\ 
Anyway , if this ever happens to you , install and run \Malwarebytes\ " while in safe mode . " 
Does anyone happen to have a Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector that they don't want ? 
Well , I came back alive ! :D Despicable Me was such a cute movie . :3 
Poll : If you found a social game on FaceBook that you enjoyed , how compelled would you be to invite your friends to play , assuming it would enhance the experience ? \ 
a . I would invite as many friends as I could to try to have more fun ! \ 
b . I might invite some people , but I don't care much if they don't join me\ 
c . I most likely wouldn't even bother\ 
d . Other ( explain)\ 
Thanks ! 
I saw Toy Story 3 last night . Grrrrrrrrrreat movie . :D Though in my opinion , the ending was bittersweet and mostly happy , not sad . 
Excuse me while I sleep for 2-3 days . 
Oxycodone + relaxing music = Jigglypuff's lullaby ( minus the facial scribbling ) . 
I went swimming for one and a half hours . I am TONED , biatches . ? 
It's so much easier to run away . The difficult part is knowing where to run . 
Life is a runaway train with no brakes , and we're just along for the ride . 
Well , fuck , I don't know what to do with a friendship that has been tainted . Just another example of the crazy fucking runaway train called \life . \"" 
Just got back from NJ . Expect some photos soon . 
So , I have a < PROPFEMALE > heart\ 
Now only needing the voice of the master\ 
Never feel hunger , never grow older\ 
My dream was to be a < PROPFEMALE > in a real puppet show 
Thanks to everyone who wished me a happy birthday ! :) \ 
To those who didn't ... you suck . >;/ 
HOLY SHIT , I WON A COPY OF STARCRAFT II COLLECTOR'S EDITION ! 
I was going through my old English papers from high school ( those of you in < PROPMALE>'s class might recognize some of the assignments ) , and it was hilarious ! When you look back , you realize just how much fun was had . That \Juno\ " SNL skit made me laugh . " 
I went to the Rally to Restore Sanity/Keep Fear Alive event today . Photos soon to come ! 
Well , it's official ; I'm going to to be a University of Baltimore student in January ! 
I hope everyone had a lovely Christmas ! More importantly , I hope everyone is prepared for Kwanzaa ! \ 
Also , I'm gonna start playing CityVille for research/review ( man , I love being an intern at a game company ) . I probably won't be playing all that long ( I gave up FrontierVille a while ago ) , but add me on your friends list if you want ( it might help with my research/review when looking at the social aspects ) . 
For those of you who have Pokémon D/P/Pt/HG/SS , make sure to take advantage of GameStop's offering of the shiny beasts Raikou ( < PROPFIRST > . 3-9 ) , Entei ( < PROPFIRST > . 17-23 ) and Suicune ( < PROPFIRST > . 31-Feb . 6 ) , as well as Celebi ( estimated as Feb . 27-Mar . 5 ) . The Celebi unlocks Zorua in B/W . 
Well , I'm in my first class at UB Shady Grove now ( Game Concept & Design ) . I am ... apparently the only female . XD At this point , I'm used to it , though . ;/ 
One of our assignments for level design is to play through Left 4 Dead 2 . I wish more professors assigned those sorts of tasks in every class ( Math Blaster , anyone ? ) . 
Yayyyy , I won a copy of Metroid 2 on eBay for under $10 ! I love finding classics for a great price . 
I'm now a member of the ECA . It only costs students and people in the military $1.00 to join ( $19.99 for others ) . Sign up , peeps ! 
My Friend Code for Pokémon White : 5286 0738 5275 
I just beat Pokémon White ! What an awesome game it was . Good thing there's more after the main story . ;p 
Don't you just love it when people harass you on YouTube and dislike all your videos just because you replied to their comments with something they disagreed with ?
