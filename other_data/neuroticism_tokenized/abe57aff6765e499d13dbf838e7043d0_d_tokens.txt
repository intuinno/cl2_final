The birds are singing outside\ 
Why do they sing ? \ 
Why can they in their simple existence , \ 
find a song ? \ 
Me in my complicated , tourted soul , \ 
be silent ? \ 
Simply Existing-Not Living . \ 
The birds song-\ 
It makes me sick to my stomach , \ 
as if they were pecking away at my insides . \ 
I physically feel the pain\ 
of being eaten . \ 
Pain of loosing life . \ 
Pain of Existing . 
I am looking for someone to teach me to play the guitar ? I have an acoustic and would love to learn . Been feeling down and need the creative outlet . Does anyone out there have the talent and the time ? 
The dark cloud that has been surrounding me for longer than i can remember is not so thick today . My step dad went down to the city for the weekend and my mom is working too . So it is just me and Storm all weekend . Does anyone want to come over and < PROPFEMALE > ? 
Full < PROPFEMALE > this weekend largest in over 20 years ! 
Speaking words of Wisdom , Let it be .
