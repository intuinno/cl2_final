Dear Youtube and All Other Concerned Parties :\ 
Do you not find it hypocritical that You have installed a light switch making it very tempting to sit on youtube and consistently flip it on and off while watching ( insert name of favored video(s ) here) ? Even through Earth hour ? Last time I check the power required to flip a virtual switch on and off would greatly exceed that of leaving one's lights on . 
Sometimes I google search my usernames ... \ 
My own stalkability bothers me often ... 
I couldn't figure out where 39mb of messages in my inbox kept hiding ... I just realized that I hadn't deleted \Sent\ " messages for at least a year ... I had 7 or 8 pages worth ... >.<"
