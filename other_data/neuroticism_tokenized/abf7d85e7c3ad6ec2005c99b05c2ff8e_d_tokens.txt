Douche Douche Douche Douche Queef ! Those words make me smile . imsoimmature . 
The only TS3 characters I made arrre : < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPMALE > , & Kaydea . < PROPFEMALE > is currently in the criminal career track & she's hydrophobic haha . < PROPMALE > fell for my Kaydea sim , but then Kaydea died in a fire . :O OH THE SUSPENSE !

Adding people I used to kinda know . xD 
I'm rather confused to be honest . People have been being rather rude . [ No one from Duluth :3 ] 
Incredibly Happy . :3 
I'm crumbing ! 
My weekend sucks . It's a whore . 
My computer speakers are picking up a phone conversation . xD !

Taking another shower . 
Even more numb . < PROPMALE > was in the shower . 
It's been so long since I've talked to any of you . Yet , a lot of you look the same . I like it . Haha . Talk ? xoxo 
I'm going to scan some of you guys ' 7th grade yearbook pictures . & Put them in an album . Unless you request me not to . It should be fun to see the differences . 
I have to pack my bags , so I can get ready to run off to < PROPFEMALE > with my child support money . xD 
Going to go lay down . Be on tomo- later today . 
I have a feeling my doctor is stupid . 
Who all has a Twitter ? 
I have so many black jokes , it's not funny ... Okay it's still funny . 
Ew I'm a conformist because I got a Twitter . Heh . Trying to cheer up , help me succeed ? 
< PROPMALE > sneeks peeks while old men are tinkling . Shhh , I told him I wouldn't tell . 
I would murder her , but he protects her . She's like a giant cunt , that just gobbles fucking happiness . 
Back ; I feel ... weird ? Like ... I don't think I should be this happy right now . 
Is letting someone win still giving up ? 
I can't fake it anymore , I'm not worth all this pain . I refuse to be anyone's burden any longer . 
Content . I'll take what I can get . xo 
G'night Facebookers . 
Worried ... I hope < PROPMALE > is okay . O_O 
Worried worried worried worried . I dun know what to doo . 
UGH ! I hate the fucking court systems in Washington . I'm going to explode . 
I was supposed to be somewhere by now ... I get way too over excited , and that always just leads to disappointment . 
I had a premonition about you all , if you don't date me , you're GOING to get an STD , and you're GOING to die . :O 
Wondering why his tweets are never about being happy with me ... =/ 
Going to sleepies . 
Just got out of the ER ... 
Laying down , I don't feel good at all . ER sucks . I love my beebee . xo 
< PROPMALE > is over . I'm having a slight panic attack ; so I came to my room for a bit . Better now ; heading back downstairs . 
Yes , I have a twitter . 
Using the library computer . Coz I'm a cool kid . 
I will NOT cry in the library ; n00bz . 
Gonna go shower ... Been tough lately ; I'm kind of proud of myself for working through it all . 
Bedtime . Nightnight . :3 
< PROPMALE > , IM me when you get on . 
Night time . Spending the whole day with < PROPMALE > , ended amazing . Off to dreamland ? Indeed . 
If you love something , let it go . If it comes back to you ; it's yours . If it doesn't; it was never meant to be . 
Just did MASH on paper ; Here's what it's telling me . I'll be with < PROPMALE > . Living in SANFRAN in a TAN with BLACK TRIMMINGS HOUSE . We'll have a RED CADILLAC DE VILLE . 2 Kids , 1 pet . I'll be a PARAPSYCHOLOGIST and he'll be doing something with GAMING . Everything in caps , or < PROPFIRST > is what the Mash came up with . xD

I gots a new kitten ; Shall I take pictures ? :3 
BeRightBack ; I do believe my food is almost ready to take the journey to my stomach . :3 
Geralt is a gross name for a baby . And I do believe parents should agree on baby names . Not just give up coz the other person is persistant . Coz then they'll be unhappy with their child's name foreverrrr . - < PROPFEMALE > - Random thought . Sorry . 
-points into air- LOOK ! A dead duck just flew by ! :3 
I has a headache . [ This is a negative post , but if you like it , it makes it a positive post , which would mean you liked a positive post . Which would completely tear apart your goal in life . ] 
Yes ; in case you hadn't noticed . I'm online . Oh AND I really need someone to talk to ; but is anyone else willing to pick up a phone ? Heh ... 
& Question of the Day : If you really wanted to < PROPFEMALE > out with someone , and it was important to you , would you call that person ? [ I think the answer is obvious , but let's hear your answers . ] :3 
Well < PROPMALE > just called to < PROPFEMALE > out today . So that's what I'll be doing . Ironic , coz he doesn't even have me on facebook ; and still like read my mind lmmfao .

What has changed about me since the last time you personally saw me ? Copy & paste this in your status to see what changes you've made . 
Coca-Cola Vanilla is the < PROPFEMALE>'s knees mate . & So are my Yoshi slippers , be jealous . 
I have a joke to tell ; message or IM if you wanna hear it ; it's epic .

\I'll never let you go < PROPFIRST > !... OhShit the water is cold ! \ " :3 " 
I just really don't want to do everything wrong anymore . 
\So ... I hear you have a lovely bunch of coconuts . \ " ;] "

\I AM GONORIA ! \ " <-- that was just shouted behind me . " 
Ugh . Damned geography . Let's fold up the world so everywhere is just a footstep away . :3 
So in an epic battle , my memory would pwn < PROPFIRST > Blakley's memory . FATALITY ! 
Cheer up Buttercup ; or I'll drop a piano on your head ; like ACME . :3 
Who has Twitter ? :3 
Me to Ricardo : \I don't know what you're doing ... with a lighter and a camera . \ " -marijuana falls out of camera case- \ " Oh ... Not a camera . \ " lmmfao . " 
Desperate for changing , starving for truth . I'm closer to where I started , I'm chasing after you . 
Me : if I pooped out THC , would you smoke my shit ? |Ricardo : No |Me : Why not ? 10 bucks a squat ! 
< PROPFIRST > Blakley is having a circle jerk with himself ; I'm psychic . 
Talking to Pj Neeley , < PROPFIRST > Erickson , and < PROPFIRST > Blakley right now . They pretty much rock my socks . 
Pj Neeley is going to be the person to invent a teleport device , that genius ! 
I think I'm addicted to pizza lunchables . 
Two of Hearts - < PROPFIRST > Q <-- listening to that right now ; it's pretty much the < PROPFEMALE>'s knees .

Hrm . < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > Ohlerking better accept my friend requests . Lol . Going out for a smoke ; be right back . 
Why does facebook apparently have it out for me ? 
Epic . < PROPFIRST > Ohlerking accepted my friend request . It's epic because last time I talked to this kid was in forth grade . Before I even moved to WI . So basically ; I'm excited . All that's left is for < PROPFEMALE > to accept . 
I think my phone is back on ; but now that I think about it ... Why the heck is ' pinchafied ' in my t9 ? 
Okay so apparently I have text but it gives me an automated message with answering calls ? O_O 
Okay something's wrong ; I'm leaving . Uhm , I'll be back sometime . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > just accepted my friend request ... woopdeedoo . 
Me and < PROPFIRST > Briesemaster are having an epic \tweet\ " convo . Be jealous . " 
Apparently is smoke time . Peace out girl scouts . 
Now when I get online , I'm all antsy for < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > Ohlerking to reply to me . Seriously ; Colorado was probably the best place I lived , and some of the most amazing people I've met were back in 1-4th grade . Other than < PROPFEMALE > Decorah < PROPFIRST > Briesemaster and < PROPFIRST > Erickson of course . 
Oh ; and < PROPFEMALE > Hurley's genitals make me happy . Lmmfao . But seriously < PROPFEMALE > Hurley is amazing ; and should have been counted in the last status . xo 
Be right back ; going outside for a bit . If you want the cellular number , ask for it . :3 
I realized that when I want to ; I'm really good at pretending . I also realized it's hard to be happy for people sometimes . Those are my thoughts at the moment , thank you for tuning in . lol . 
Smoke time . & My phone died . :o 
I really miss having the biggest worry in my life being the skiball machine being broken at Kids ' Choice , or missing wednesday swimming trips . Why do we want to grow up so badly ? I want to go back to those days . 
Getting offline . Peace out girlscouts . 
You know what I don't get ? Throwing away friendship . You know what else I don't get ? Your mum .

Getting offline . Phone will be charged sometie today- I'll text < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > Ohlerking , and < PROPFIRST > Erickson when it's on . :3

Eating ranch whea t-t hins . Wishing I could text Pj Neeley & others . My tummy hurts . 
I cut my hair today ; should I upload pictures ? :O 
Ugh ; I'm in such a RAWR mood . You have no idea . & it doesn't help that I'm not smoking on 420 . xD 
\My hair is growing nuts ! \ " \ " Get it neutered ? \ " Ohyeah ; I crack myself up . " 
Who has Yahoo messenger ? 
I just found random pictures I < PROPFIRST > of some MN people , that Me , < PROPFEMALE > Decorah , and < PROPFIRST > Briesemaster wrote comments on . I may take pictures . 
To make someone feel awkward ; just randomly shout [ i'll use PJ's name in this as an example ] \NO PJ I WILL NOT GIVE YOU A FOOTJOB ! \ " -Bows- thank you for your time ladies & gents . " 
My phone yelled in Pj Neeley's ear . & He yelled back due to the pain in his nose ? 
Excuse me , I misread that ; it was pain of the noise , not in his nose . xD 
that Guy : you make me feel all nervous but in a good way ... sooooooo anyway what are you wearing jk brilliantyoshiegg : family guy pj pants , yoshi slippers , a polka < PROPFEMALE > shirt , and and Ecko jacket . brilliantyoshiegg : and just for a sexy touch ; brilliantyoshiegg : I'm not wearing socks brilliantyoshiegg : lmmfao 
brilliantyoshiegg : ... I gotta tinkle brilliantyoshiegg : OH NO that Guy : then go tinkle ? brilliantyoshiegg : I must resist brilliantyoshiegg : Tinkle is actually the devil trying to escape through my urethra that Guy : lol well , why do you want to keep the devil inside of you brilliantyoshiegg : Coz he's HUGE and him coming out my pee-hole would kill me . that Guy : So you want to keep him inside of you because he is HUGE ? 
Oh by the way , you have a lovely bunch of coconuts . 
Ah the memories . < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > was there for my first ' girl-crush ' < PROPFIRST > Ohlerking was there for my first time having a birthday party . < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Spooner was there for my first cigarette . < PROPFEMALE > Decorah and < PROPFIRST > Briesemaster were just THERE . xoxo

Hahhaa . The comment I just left on < PROPFEMALE > Zwirtz's photo had me \Knee-Slapping\ " for a good bit . OhLawdy ... I'm too nerdy for my own good . 8 ] " 
So when I fly into NCL , I wonder who's gonna drive on the wrong side of the road to come get me . 
You know what ? I'm sick of people taking my friends for granted . I'm sick of seeing my friends get hurt , and sick of seeing people wanting to give up on love . Seriously ; I may have pneumonia , but I can still kick some ass . 
... By the way , new quote . 
<-- Will stop spamming < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE>'s status with replies now . :v 
Who wants to talk on the telephone while I go smoke ? 
Expectations ! Expectations ! Seriously . I hate feeling like I'm not ' up-to-par ' since I keep disappointing people . 
Going outside . About to cry like crazy probably . Ugh ; I'm stupid . Heh . 
< PROPFIRST > Blakley is a prostitute .

All my days were spent by the telephone that never rang . And all I needed was a call that never came . 
I got me some apple pie and cookie dough ice-cream . Sharing it with < PROPFIRST > Blakley . 
I bought an umbrella from Target the other day , brought it to the < PROPMALE > Center ... Left it in the Anime Store ... and got UMBRELLA JACKED by the Asian lady running the store . >.> 
Just figured out why the KGB Sumo guy doesn't just repeat what the other guy said . 
I've come to realize that many people crushed on me in 8th grade . Okay , maybe not many . But < PROPFIRST > Erickson definitely did . 
DeviantArt is being mega slow today . 
So the internet was a complete douche yesterday . 
I just pre-ordered Fallout : New Vegas . :D 
Hrm fuck . My eyeballs are being sluts . 
Jebus . I love Google Maps . It's so much fun . 
I've decided that a pokemon game with the gameplay of fallout 3 would be amazing . & Thus my imagination has brought me to believe that Megaton has Pokemon . 
My imagination has also brought me to believe that radroaches are in my bedroom ... But golly , it was my kitten . xD 
June 19th ; Hopefully the date I'll be able to come back . xoxo . It's all up to < PROPFEMALE > Hurley , < PROPFEMALE > Zwirtz , and LoftGirl . [ Kristi ] . I dun know her . :O 
It's final . June 19th . Duluth here I come . OhLawdy . I could just ... <(^_^<) (v ^_^ v) (>^_^)> 
Having a Garage sale today . I'm excited . Thinking about getting off facebook and on Fallout 3 or Oblivion , but haven't made up my mind yet . 
I shall be-right-back . and < PROPMALE > Curtindale your last reply went POOF in my inbox . It's lost . O_O 
is back . WITH REFRESHMENTS ! 
Wah . I'm super lame . Sold a bunch of stuff at the garage sale yesterday , but I went to go play < PROPFEMALE > Trek Monopoly , and realized we sold it . Why would that make me sad-ish ? Coz I'm a nerd . 8 ] 
Going back to watch True Life . Be back later ? Perhaps .

started saying \milk the penis ... \ 
Be right back , smoke time . 
Who has a DeviantArt account ? :3 
< PROPFEMALE > Crandall just made my night . She's hilarious . :D 
Singing \Fall For You\ " by Secondhand Serenade for < PROPFEMALE>'s Got Talent . "

I feel like a good sister . I got < PROPMALE > Lautzenheiser a PS3 for his 18th birthday . Jebus , he's 18 .... I'm scared . 
I don't understand why no one just buys the live lobsters at the grocery store , and keep them as pets . Lobsters are the shit . I want a lobster pet . D: 
Success ! I made Pj Neeley want a pet lobster . 
My boyfreind is amazing !!! If only guys in the world were more like him . He's sooo amazing . I love Barny 
... So I just got Facebook raped . 
ACK ! How DARE anyone say that a miscarriage is a good thing . I'm sorry , but in no twist is the loss of a child a good thing to me . I don't know who could be so heartless as to think that a social life is more important than a child . Tsk tsk . 
Thanks to < PROPFIRST > Erickson I have a rad taxi driver . \ 
Ima sit in the front . Yeah . That's right . I'm a rebel .

It's been so long , but I'm pretty sure it's been this way all along . She's amazing , she's beautiful . She's all I've ever wanted and she's leaving me behind . 
Shelbee Brutal just reminded me of Lil ' < PROPMALE > . O_O 
Men in Black is on . I always picture \Fresh Prince\ " in 80's colors while watching this movie . " 
Am I the only one that gets a little surge of excitement when I see a new type of Lucky Charms in the cereal isle ? = X

Passed out this morning . My dreams today were ... amazing . 
Sounds like shit everyone goes through , only difference is that you don't see that other people have hard lives too . Your life is < PROPFEMALE > compared to some people's . < PROPMALE > up . 
My phone is back on . \ 
I can't find < PROPFIRST > Briesemaster or < PROPFEMALE > Decorah's < PROPFIRST > on here . \

CMT just notified me , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is a pimp . 
Not feeling so well . Rather pukey . \ 
Maybe it's due to putting < PROPFEMALE > , cloves , and cinnamon on my face ? \ 
Doubt it , but maybe . xD 
I wouldn't walk 500 < PROPMALE > , I'd probably take the effing bus . Just to be the asshole waiting for a bus that's never on time now . DADADADA DADADADA ! 
\AH YOU JUST FARTED\ " \ " No ... I didn't\ " \ " UGH IT STINKS UGH UGH UGH ! \ " \ " ... Was this the noise ? ( squeaks foot across floor)\ " \ " Oh ... Uh ... Yeah ... I guess I was just mind fucked \"" 
Bleeeeeeh . \ 
I feel so ... \ 
well , bleh . \ 
Sicksicksick . \ 
My tummy is warring with my body . \ 
Damn you tummy of doom , DAMN YOU ! 
OhLawdy . \ 
I'm terribly sorry for not being on Facebook in ages . \ 
I've been sick like no other . \ 
Hence the postponed return . 
When I type out \Grrrrr\ " I just noticed that I also make a really lame angry face while I'm typing it . >.>" 
So the day is practically over , and yet again , no doctor call . \ 
Ugh . 
Spray on hair remover is slippery . -.-; 
LaDeeDa . Coming back to MN after Kumoricon . \ 
Stupid doctors finally got off their asses . \

I wonder if anyone could pick me up from the airport when I come back to MN ... \

I wonder if anyone has the last name \Whore\ " . \ 
Argh . Damn you and your mind boggles . 
Be right back . Gonna ... Get foods . I don't know what we have , so it might take a while . 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Simpson made me lose the game . \ 
Now it's your turn . 
You're not the boss of me now & you're not so big ! Life is unfaiiiiir . 
Fckin ' Ai . \ 
Really ? \ 
Ugh . \ 
Well that sucks . \

I swear , if I had more balls , I'd tell him everything . 
Looking for someone in Duluth that can afford 325$ a month for a 1 bathroom 2 bedroom . I need a roommate . 810.5 E 5th Street 
ARGH ! My cosplay wig apparently was never sent . Fucking site . Grrrawrgh . 
I feel clever . My cleverness will never be noticed . Mwahhaa !

< PROPFEMALE > ' Omnomnom ' Smith and < PROPFIRST > Blakley have not found friends by using Facebook's Friend Finder . \ 
Lies & Slander Facebook ! 
I think I'm gonna go to sleepers . Maybe he'll figure it out on his own . HA ! Kidding . Pretty sure he's oblivious . 
\Are you suggesting later would be a good time to cadoodle ? \ " - < PROPMALE > Moline \ 
\Your face is a nasal problem\ " - < PROPFEMALE > Crandall\ 
Just kidding , I was a < PROPMALE > fire ! 
Be Right Back . :O \ 
nukkuh . 
Gonna go < PROPFEMALE > out with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > and all them . They're pretty cool cats . Be back laterrr . :D 
According to < PROPFIRST > Burbage I'm officially \KayFive\ " \ 
< PROPFEMALE > Decorah and < PROPFIRST > Briesemaster are mean for watching Finding Nemo without me . D:< that is my angry face . Feel my wrath . 
I tweeted about < PROPFIRST > Briesemaster and < PROPFEMALE > Decorah . Coz that's how disappointed I am about not watching Finding Nemo . 
BeRightBack . \ 
What time is it ? \ 
ADVENTURE TIME ! 
I miss my lip bling . \ 
Should I repierce ? 
I gotta go in about 5 minutes . 
Anyone wanna see the flash I submitted on Newgrounds ? :3 
\My feet are asleep\ " Me ---> \ " Hrm ... I think I like that ... \ " * clicks like*\ 
Brb . \ 
Making some burritos . \ 
Nukkuh . 
So I made the burritos . \ 
Went outside while they were in the microwave . \ 
Then got inside and decided I didn't want them . \ 
That was too much effort for my liking . 
Someone ate the burritos I made earlier ! \ 
I finally decided to eat them , \ 
and they're GONE ! \ 
Assfaces . 
BeRightBack . 
BackBackBack . I'm on Twitter , and DeviantArt , and obviously Facebook . \ 
Who has DA or Twitter ? 
My head grew . \ 
I think if my head ever somehow made me float , \ 
I'd stand in my front lawn\ 
and charge people to hold my hand , \ 
while I'm tethered to the ground ... \ 
... Like a mini-Hot-Air-Balloon ride ! 
I'm not hungry at all . But I saw < PROPMALE > Lautzenheiser making a bagel with cream cheese , and now it sounds suuuper good ... BUT ... I'm still not hungry . Damn you Midnight snacking ! 
I wonder , \ 
If you cloned yourself , then killed your clone ... \ 
Is that technically suicide sense you have the same DNA ? \ 
O_O 
Ugh . I hate my anxiety . When I talk to people I always feel like either I'm bugging them TO THE < PROPMALE > , or I'm just plain annoying ... Fxck ... Both of those are basically the same . Still , it's not a good feeling . 
BeRightBack . < PROPMALE > Lautzenheiser hadn't checked his Facebook yet , so I did the honors of reading to him outloud the epic conversation that took place in his status . Haha . He's not as thrilled as I am ... 
Is super proud of < PROPFIRST > Ohlerking . Congratz on having MUCH more will power than I'll probably ever have . Not many people have that kind of will power , so you're definitely enviable . ( Not to mention you're probably the most genuine person I've ever had the pleasure to meet , and that is something to be proud of . ) Something as simple as a genuine person shouldn't be so hard to find , but it seems nowwadays it's a rarity . 
No shit Sherlock ! ( Laxative Watson ... ) 
Aha ! < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > inspired me to have a nostalgia moment tonight and watch An Americal Tail . It won't be till later , but I'm just so excited I had to post it NOW . Haha . 
I just got notified of how early I must wake up tomorrow . \ 
-gaspeth-\ 
That's extreme . 
When I think I've spelled something wrong in messenger , I type the word in Google , and \Do You Mean___ ? \ " Always hooks me up . ( We're homies . ) Does anyone else cheat-spell in this manner ? " 
Ugh . I've gotten that \These people don't really like me\ " vibe a lot today ... Accompanied with \ " I'm probably annoying the shit out of every one of them . \ " and just a dash of \"= / Sometimes I wish I wasn't so odd . \"" 
Ugh , I bit my tongue way too hard . Now , it's just purposely swelling up , just at the tip , to spite me . That's the worst part about biting your tongue/cheek , it swells and then insists on getting bit again . Assholes . 
Be Right Back . I wonder if < PROPMALE > had work today ... =/ 
Just got done watching An American Tail ... It was just as epic as I expected , I enjoy my nostalgic moods very much . -nods excitedly- 
Actually ; Ima stay up for another 15-30 minutes . Even though it's probably not a good idea . I gotta get up early to go with my mommy and get stuff for this weekend . Kumoricon is so exciting , when I'm telling people how excited I am , I squeel . >.<; 
OhMyLawdy . My anxiety was already peaking , and now it mega spiked . This is what I get for not talking to anyone about crap . : x 
OhBoy . I will be right back . Smoking a stink-stick . ( I'm pretty sure my various forms of slang are dang-near-TheBEST . EVER . ) 
... Accepted ? -severe mind boggle- O_O + :O = My face for 2 full seconds . Don't worry , I realized I looked moronic , and got a hold of myself before anyone could see . Apparently I'm having a lot of ' fails ' today . 
Midnight snack time , most likely . I thought a pudding cup sounded good , but I'm very indecisive at the moment . I'll figure it out . BeRightBack 
I am back , if you have not noticed . 
Okay ; NOW I MUST MUST sleep . I've been mega tired , but I keep getting distracted . \ 
Byebye . Getting last-minute touch to Kairi cosplay . ^.^ 
Ahh . Kumoricon pictures coming up \in a jiffy\ " . \ 
UGH . I do NOT like that . -.-; 
Hrmm ... Dear Cosmo Schultz , you have the most amazing birth-name EVARRRR ! Also , I adore you . Thanks . :3 
Brb , food . \ 
Sorry for not talking very much at the moment everyone , \ 
been busy , \ 
be RIGHT back to talk . \ 
:3 
Super super tired . Getting offline . \ 
Hopefully I won't be sick anymore when I wake up . 
Hazzah ! Pigs in a Blanket for dinner . \ 
You have no idea how amazing my pigs in a blanket are . \ 
I make the best . 
Ask me something ? \ 
http://www.formspring.me/Kaydea 
I shall be right back - noobsters . \ 
;D 
Friends are like potatoes ... if you eat them , they'll DIE ! 
\You eat your friends ? \ " - < PROPMALE > Lautzenheiser " 
In case I haven't mentioned it , I couldn't have asked for people better than < PROPFEMALE > Piersall and Nataya Smalley to go to Kumoricon with . Even if I was sick or not sharing every car ride . You guys really made it amazing for me . Thank you . xoxo 
[ Still BRB , just now getting off my ass to brb . Got distracted with the fake wrestling on the tele . So , brb starting NOW . Haha . ] 
Wtf . My arm is pink . O_O 
I'm on here , DeviantArt , Twitter , Xanga AND Mycrib , and no one can even clarify that I'm dying ?! ... Seriously ; my arm has been pink for a couple hours now , wtf . 
I'll be baaack . 
Om nom nom . I live for the time of year when Pumpkin Spice is in season at Starbucks . OhLawdy ; sooo good . 
When I upstage someone while they're trying to brag .... I feel the need to say \Suck on THAT puddy-tat ! \ " ... I think that might just be my addiction to rhyming speaking though . " 
Damn . I totally just had an unattractive mental picture of < PROPFEMALE > with a \ 
swollen tongue hanging out of the mouth , and a bottle of Listerine \ 
balanced on her tummy , while trying to smoke a swisher . I'm amused . 
No Grapenuts , for grandma ! Grandma eats a bran muffin . [ Aha , I love this song . ] 
\Food-Formed chesticles turn me onn . \"" 
URRRGH ! I don't understand it ! How can ANYONE be so cold-hearted as to sit here and be disrespectful about my friend's recent death ?! Frickin ... I wouldn't be disrespectful if the deceased was someone I DIDN'T LIKE . Not to mention ; someone I DIDN'T KNOW . If you didn't know < PROPMALE > , then send whatever best wishes you have , but keep your immature , rude , cold-hearted comments to yourself . Ugh . 
Ahh . People never learn . 
I love being ' taught a lesson in maturity ' from someone who has to stoop so low as to mooch , and make someone else feel like shit , while sleeping and eating under THEIR PARENTS ' ROOF . I don't get how when people are being nice enough to give you a place to stay , you still find it appropriate to make their daughter constantly feel either attacked or judged . \ 
... Yes , that sounds like maturity to me . 
I have to get offline for a little bit , \ 
anxiety attack coming on , \ 
need to get air . 
Calmed down for the most part , \ 
still having breathing issues ... \ 
And ' psychotic thoughts'\ 
like ... Maybe I should just let him take my place ? \ 
Be gone & done . 
I documented ( screenshotted ) everything that has been said offensively . I think that's quite mature of me to stick up for myself and take action in a way that doesn't involve physical \vengeance\ " as \ " some\ " like to call it . " 
My biggest pet peeve ? When people don't stop to realize they're no better than anyone else , and keep holding themselves , and their reasoning above others ' feelings . 
Gonna watch Phantom of the Opera ... Ahhh ... Absolutely adore this movie . x 
BeRightBack Lovelies . :3 \ 
[ New ... Erm old pictures , but new to facebook , have been uploaded . Heh . ]

Yahoo or Aim anyone ? 
NOT looking forward to court . Hopefully I won't have to go if I remember to send in the money orders n such . 
By the way ; a LOT of heavy crap going on in my life right now . I don't know why , but apparently me not being on Facebook for a while makes 6+ people think I'm avoiding facing life . Quite the opposite lovelies , Facebook is just the least of my worries at the moment . x 
\I've been fondling Facebook\ " - < PROPFIRST > Jones "

Ugh . Lame . Lonely . Bored . \

Baaack . \ 
Downloading music is distracting . 
I need more good music to listen to ... \

This is why I'm afraid of heights ... Damn tall chairs . \ 
Gaming time . \

Okay ; I took 2 pictures of horn tooting . xD 
I'm buying a french horn . Just because Gen Cox wants me to . Aren't I a charmer ? [: 
This girl , < PROPFEMALE > , Oh boy . She has power over me without even trying .
