<3 Baba comes home today WOO HOO <3 
@ Work ... Dude just walked in wearing a mini skirt , a bright orange wig and white lashes . Bet you can't top that . HAHAHA 
A true friend doesn't care if your house is untidy , your car makes funny noises , if you only have $5.00 in the bank this week , or that your family is not perfect ... they love you for who you are . A true friend can go long periods of time without speaking and never question their friendship . REPOST if you are blessed enough to have at least one true friend ! 
Baby bro is racing @ < PROPMALE > today . GOOD LUCK !!! 
I might not be pretty , I don't have a perfect body , I might not be anyones first choice , but I'm ME ! I don't pretend to be someone else . I might not be proud of some of the things I've done in the past , but I wouldn't change a thing . I've learned from my mistakes and now I'm a better person . I laugh always and love easily . I sing constantly and care unconditionally . I'm just me and I'm proud of who I am today . 
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars ? I could really use a wish right now . 
? ? I'm a saint and I'm a sinner , I'm a loser , I'm a winner , I am steady and unstable , I'm young , but I am able ? ?

So my ears just popped after 2 days of being plugged , apparently I've been missing < PROPMALE > details in conversations . I think I just agreed to marry an old guy that came in for coffee . \ 
Here's how it went .. \

Me : WHAT ?!?! ( o_O ) 
Mr. and Mrs. Smith , then bed . Still feeling blah , hope I feel better tomorrow . Goodnight <3 
So I've discovered a solution for staying cool in this disgustingly , humid heat . Drink loads of slushies . It creates an internal air conditioning system . Now I can walk around all nice and cool .... oh .. and jiggly ... I'm still working out the kinks . Hey ! There's side affects with everything now-a-days LOL 
Sleeping Beauty with < PROPFEMALE > : ) I <3 Disney !! 
UCK !! Okay , we all know money is dirty but did you ever stop to think HOW dirty ?!? I just saw a dude blow his nose in a dollar < PROPMALE > and another guy had to literally take off his shoe and sock to get to his !! I'm sooo grossed out (>_<) I'm stocking up hand sanitizer for sure !!

Thank you everyone for all the Birthday Wishes !! It was a great b-day :D

Transmissions echoing away\ 
Far from the world of you and I\ 
Where oceans bleed into the sky ? 
Home sick for the past couple days . Now I'm watching Extreme Make-Over Home Edition and realizing that nothing sucks more than crying like a big baby when you already hurt all over . A nap is sounding pretty good right now . 
<3 \ 
? There's a whole in my heart and I < PROPFEMALE > it wherever I go , \ 
like a treasure that travels with me down every road . \ 
Even though my heart aches , there's a smile on my face \ 
cause just like the window to heaven there's a light shining through . \ 
There's a whole in my heart in the shape of you . ? 
So ... I've been diagnosed with a disease .... It's called Procrastination . Pray for me , it's terminal . 
I really need a punching bag at work ! 
just said good morning to a woman only to get shooed away . Yep , I got shooed :/ 
misses her friends :(

Ahhh Baba ... Thank you for proving that sometimes men DO scream like girls ^_^ 
Oh Black Friday , how you surprise me . The stores I thought would suck rocked and the ones I thought would be a breeze kept us in the cold for an extra hour . Some stores smartened up while others dumbed it down . Shame on you Kmart for assuming I'm suppose to get the DVD anti-theft case off myself . An you , Old Navy , It's one thing to not get the free game but to find out you marked up the coats o_O tsk tsk . 
Watched Legion the other day with < PROPFEMALE > Ramahi and Salam Ramahi ... now I'm at work waiting for a crazy lady to come in and start walking on the ceiling ^_^

Ughh !! There's vaccines for everything now-a-days : Flu , Chicken Pox , Measles , HPV , Hepatitis , TB ... Don't you think it's about time some brainiac creates a vaccine for bad moods . Seriously ! One person has it , then they spread their icky bad mood germs and now I have it . And I was having such a good day too . (>_<)

Found out some really interesting info this afternoon ... apparently I'm \too white to be talking about drug testing and welfare . \ " This said by my OCC classmates .

Too tired to sleep ... is that even possible ?!?! 
Why do I feel like I have to impress everyone lately ?!? I give up :/ 
Stupid people make me want to do baaaaad things >:/ 
Had the pleasure of seeing < PROPFEMALE > Goodson and her hubby < PROPMALE > for dinner . It's been sooo long since I've seen them . Hope we can get together again :) 
Seeing all these losers blaring music from their cell phones reminds me of those same losers who used to walk down the street with a boombox on their shoulder ! Yep , they thought they were the $# ! t too . There seriously needs to be a PSA for headphones O_o 
Happy Anniversary to < PROPFEMALE > Cairo & < PROPFIRST > Croteau !!! Love you guys ^_^
