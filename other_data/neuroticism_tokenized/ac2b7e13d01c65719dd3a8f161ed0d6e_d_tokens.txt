Selling tickets to Eclipse : The Twilight Saga for a Cross Country fundraiser . June 29th at the San Tan 16 .

Helping little kids be track stars was sweet . Track banquet was fun . Lots of food . Slip & Slide rocked hard ... but I fell on the cement after peeling out and sliced my leg open in 5 spots . Not so fun . Overall , a good morning / afternoon .

Good fucking game , England . Sorry , but 2 goals that quickly ? You deserve to lose this game now .

Oh well . My alarm is set for 6:15 . Officially about 3 hours of sleep for my first day of school . That's more than I got the last 2 years . Once again sleeping on the couch , haven't slept in my bed since I got back from XC camp . Now its time to see if I can actually fall asleep . 
Operation sleep = failure . Now its just like last year . 
Coffee is in the pot . 
Well , went to bed early last night . And now my schedule for school is set . Bed by 9 , wake up at 6 . At least , that is my plan , and what I am going to TRY and stick to from now on . Here is to hoping I can do it . 
This is sad ... its kinda pathetic too . I went to bed last night at 9:30 , woke up at 6 . By my math , I got 8 and a half hours of sleep . By 4th hour , I'm already exhausted and need a nap . Why can't is it that the only time I feel good is over the summer when I sometimes sleep for 12-14 hours straight ?

Ever have those days where you go to sleep , wake up , feel like its been 4 hours , and then roll over to find out its only been 30 minutes ? That's why I only got 3 hours of sleep last night . 4:30 - 7:30 just felt like a full 24 hours to me ... 
my 7 year old brother is sitting here playing cod : mw2 
the only thought that managed to get me out of bed was that even though is the first day of my \week\ " its not monday "

Cross Country is scored based off the first 5 finishing runners on each time . Based on what place you finish in , you get points added to your score , ( lower placing , lower score , its like golf , lowest score wins ) . < PROPMALE > Field and 5 runners in the top 10 , we had 5 runners in the top 10 . Score was tied , and I placed 11th . Because of that , I was the tie breaker who won the meet for Higley .

8 < PROPMALE > for XC practice today . Pretty beast . Went straight from there to Powerpuff as a cheerleader . Seniors rocked the game . Better luck next year Juniors , but we ended 2-0 . 
I'm trying to find the difference between work and safety . Today during practice after the three mile < PROPFIRST > , I felt like I was going to pass out . My last two < PROPMALE > were REALLY slow . 
I have a strange new respect for someone in my life . For probably the first time in my life , someone looked me straight in the eye and put me in my place . 
Just got home from XC . Homecoming game tonight , and homecoming dance tomorrow night . Apparently my ethnicity changed since yesterday , and I'm no longer a Greek god , and am now a < PROPMALE > god . Big question ... what is the difference ?

Best part of the night was sitting at Sonic with Aidan and < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > listening to Aidan's stories of sarcasm and mockery . The history of Rootbeer has been revealed to me , 
UPROAR TODAY ! Leaving at about 1 PM , so I think it time to head to bed and get what rest I can . 
just left uproar . my shirt is so wet it feels like i just got out of a pool . all from sweat . only half of it mine . i smell like cigarrets , weed , and sweat . 
Now that I have accurately described the Uproar experience , time to take the longest shower of my life , go to bed , hate being at school tomorrow , and hate XC practice even more . Tomorrow is going to hurt guys . 
just had an interesting thought . what if a knife juggler has to sneeze ? 
Woah boy . Fun time tonight at the XC party tonight . After thinking about the comment on the announcements , \Swimmers burn more calories in one day than most people can eat in a week . \ " . I have a new statement . < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > can eat more calories in one day than swimmers can burn in a week . " 
Styx , Blondie , Cheap Trick , Heart , Bon Jovi , Journey , Boston , Duran Duran , The Scorpions , Guns & Roses , < PROPFIRST > Halen ... and others . All of the good stuff .

Today is going to be another rough monday . My head feels like someone oppened the top , and just started punching my brain . too bad i forgot to take anything 
weights class always makes me feel like a beast . did reps of 10 again , 235x10 for a new squat < PROPMALE > of 315 . 
Ran my two warm up laps , shirtless , in the rain today for XC . Nothing like a good time . AZ weather is so bipolar , it makes me want to smile . 
I disliked Glee to begin with , but after hearing the Glee cover of \I Want To Hold Your Hand\ " I now hate it even more . " 
Oh well . Some things really aren't my business , and I refuse to comment on them even when I hold a strong opinion on the matter , simply so that I don't need to aggravate people . Apparently , I do that enough already . 
I like Burger < PROPMALE > and Pumas 
I just tried going back and playing my GH : 2 for my PS2 , and apparently sitting there collecting dust , my controller broke . Anyone still have a working one that I can borrow for a few days ? 
XC is supposed to run today . To all my XC buddies , how far or long are you running today ? Give some ideas so that when I go out to run around 11 PM I can keep up with you guys . 
XC practice tomorrow will be hiking ... do I go in shorts and running shoes like I would to any other practice , or jeans and boots because we're hiking .

Sometimes I wonder , how much am I missing ? How many of the subtle hints are people throwing me , do I not get ? How many small things do I not notice ? 
So , for anyone who knows about my lost time , it happened again last night . Sat down on my coach and started watching Bones , and the next thing I remember is waking up somewhere else . Luckily , this time the somewhere else was actually MY bed this time . 
My sister just got hit on her way home from school , and her car got totaled . 
Just failed a song on expert drums for RB2 ... there can be only one cause of this . I was wearing too many clothes while I attempted to play . Proven by the fact that I passed with a 98% once I took my shirt off . 
So , my rocket went nowhere near the highest , as its vertical liftoff was really sad . However , its design did cause its float to be pretty good , so its overall displacement was probably the best .

Happy Holidays to everyone here . Also , I want to give a shoutout to all the men and women at arms who aren't here to share this day with us , along with their families . We thank you for your service to < PROPFEMALE > for allowing us to have our freedom . God Bless < PROPFEMALE > . 
Sometimes there are these small things you can pick up along the way to increase you < PROPMALE > at success . But eventually you need to stop blaming not having enough of those little things , and take some personal responsibility for failure . 
About to make French Toast . But I only know a recipe that makes enough for like , 3 or 4 people . Who wants to come over and eat French Toast with me ? 
Sometimes , stuff happens that makes me insecure , and feel badly about myself . But then I realize how awesome I am , and it all goes away . \ 
I am always right . I thought I was wrong once , but it turns out I wasn't . 
I think one of these days I will sit here on Facebook staring at my Most Recent < PROPFEMALE > , doing nothing but correcting people's spelling and grammar ... just for fun . 
164 days until I leave for boot camp . Countdown started , little anxious but can't wait . From there , it's 13 weeks of hell . Sounds like my kind of fun .

Halftime Show Official Analysis : \ 
Showmanship - 9.5 . Good lights , interesting effects using the people in the suits with the lights , inventive , and unique outfits . Slightly repetitive at times . \ 
Music - 6 . Between the Black Eyed Peas , and Usher , I think that asking 2 artists who rely heavily on electronic effects brought the show down . I liked the music , but it was a poor live performance .

Track meet #1 today . Time to go rip it up . 
I hurt ... 4x800 went well . 400m went well enough for it being my first time this year . However , going from the 400 to almost no rest , to the 800m , my 800 time was TERIABAD . 
Plans so far ? Movies and shenanigans with Aidan tomorrow . I am Number 4 with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > on Tuesday . Track on Monday at 9 AM , track Tuesday - Saturday at 7 AM . Track the Monday right before break ends at 3 PM . Anytime else I am free . Hit me up if you want to do something . 
Aidan got here around 10:30 . Watched Zombieland , went to get lunch . Came home , played through the entirety of Silent Hill : Shattered Memories , dabbled a little bit in Resident Evil 4 , F.E.A.R , and Dead Space . Loaded my FFVII save at the end of the game , and made him watch the cinematic . He is now driving home in the dark , to be home alone . He is frightened .
