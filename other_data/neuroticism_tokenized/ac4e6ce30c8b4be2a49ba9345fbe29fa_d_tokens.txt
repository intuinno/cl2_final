Let's see how creative my Facebook friends are . Please leave me a 1-word comment that best describes me using the THIRD letter of your FIRST name . It can only be 1 word . Then copy and paste this to your wall so I can leave a word about you . Please don't just post a word and not copy ; that's just no fun . 
I find it kinda freaky that the ad council and FEMA have started the \emergency < PROPFEMALE > preparedness\ " commercials .... " 
Off to teh gym and washin clothes :}

Another day goin in on a day off :P 
On the floors of Tokyo\ 
Down in London town's a go-go\ 
With the record selection\ 
And the mirror's reflection\ 
I'm a-dancing with myself\ 
Oh , when there's no one else in sight\ 
In the crowded , lonely night\ 
Well , I wait so long for my love vibration\ 
And I'm dancing with myself\ 
Oh , dancing with myself\ 
Well there's nothing to lose\ 
And there's nothing to prove\ 
And I'm dancing with myself 
At mom's house dog sitting , being bored , go me !! 
Night Night NEVERLAND 
black eyed pas aren't good ... but I find that I want the helmet of the dude 
Not being emo or sympathy seeking .... but Facebook asks what's on my mind and in the words of < PROPFIRST > Chambers :\ 
Am I not pretty enough\ 
Is my heart too broken\ 
Do I cry too much\ 
Am I too outspoken\ 
Don't I make you laugh\ 
Should I try it harder\ 
Why do you see right through me\ 
I live , I breathe , I let it rain on me\ 
I sleep , I wake , I try hard not to break\ 
I crave , I love , I've waited long enough\ 
I try as hard as I can 
I would like all my Facebook friends to comment on this status about how you met me . But I want you to LIE . That's right . Just make it up . After you comment , copy this to your status so I can do the same . 
I think it's time to put the Futon back into couch mode ... and sleep on it that way , taking up too much dang room <_<
