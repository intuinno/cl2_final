Feeling like I'm up aginst the world ... and right now ... I'm losing . 
\So what am I supposed to say when I'm all choked up and you're ok ? I'm fallin to pieces ... \"" 
Look around and tell me what you see ... in your heart is this what you really want ? I refuse to believe after everything , this is how it ends . 
A person's strength is not measured by thier physical or intellectual talent but by when the moment comes when their back is to the wall if and if they choose to fold and give up ... or stand to fight for what they believe in . You make your choice .. I've already made mine . 
Yesterday is history , tomorrow is mystery , today is a gift , thats why it is known as the present ... Anger is one letter short of Danger . 
Call me Mr. Flintstone I can make yo BeD RoCk ! 
Rediscovering and realizing how much I enjoyed and missed the life i left behind ... 
Couldnt have brought in the new year any better ! Last night was absolutely amazing =) 
\Our hearts are hungry for a food that won’t come // We could make a feast from these crumbs // And we’re all staring down the barrel of a gun // So if your life flashed before you // What would you wish you would’ve done ? \"" 
People need to learn some damn respect before i beat it into them with a baseball bat ! 
leave it to boise to run a trick play ! fake punta pass ! 
I HATE snow !!!!!!!! 
So give me reason to prove me wrong , to wash this memory clean Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes Give me reason to fill this hole , connect the space between Let it be enough to reach the truth in lies ... across this new divide 
Only got 86 400 seconds in a day // to turn it all around or throw it all away // gotta tell em that we love em while we got the < PROPMALE > to say // gotta live like we're dying 
I would like to buy some pass defense now please ! 
OT here we come !! < PROPMALE > Rackers is my hero !! GO PACK !! 
i hate everything to do with arizona 
It's 4:03 and I can't sleep ... Without you next to me I toss and turn like the sea . If I drown tonight , Bring me back to life . Breathe your breath in me the only thing that i still believe in is you . If you only knew ... 
Watchin Conan's last show and ironically ... this is the first time I have ever watched it hahaha 
Niagra Falls pictures up ( stolen from < PROPFIRST > ) I will have mine up later tonight and I just want to tell you all that I did indeed find Nemo there !!! 
New Niagra Falls pics up ! comment ! 
Under the TV lights , you fell asleep again/You dont know , I'm writing this song about you/There's a picture of a Hollywood sign , reflecting off your skin/I Don't want to live another day without you/You woke up and said baby I , had one of those dreams again/The rain came down and I lost you , In the wind/You said something ... about don't leave , when you fell back asleep/Before I could sing my song back to you ... 
I'm stretching but you're just out of reach ... 
SAINTS ! 
Not a Saint's fan but I am < PROPFEMALE > glad they won the Superbowl . No team nor CITY deserves a win more than New Orleans ! GO SAINTS !!!! btw ... I bet Bourban Street is crazy as hell right now !

\And I think what I just wrote is going over my head/I'm stealing lines from myself/And what I said was never said ... /It's just a lyrical lie/Made up in my mind .. /You want to be dressed in poetry/But imagery doesn't fit/And you want resizing/But darling dear/get a grip ... \"" 
Change where you layin ' I'm just sayin ' L to the O V to the E K to the I N to the G I don't know how they treat you How they do it where you at But all I'm tryna say is You should know me like that

how many bs calls can the cavs get ??? seriously ?? lets just let them back in the game refs ! This is why i hate < PROPMALE > 
GAME OVER . I love the celtics 
This shit was all I know , You and me only , And I did it all for you , Still you were lonely , We coulda worked it out , Uhh , but I guess things change , Its funny how someone else’s success brings pain , When ya no longer involved that person has it all , And you just stuck standing there starin at it all But I’m gonna need you to say something baby 
One Word . 
Idk if i really want LeBron to leave clevland bc then i have to listen to all of these whiny cavs fans complain until the end of time .... 
Life is built upon risks . If you wait to do everything until you're sure it's right , you're doomed to fail . Because without risk , there is no gain and without gain there lies doubt . What is worse , the risk of pain or the pain of endless doubt ? 
necesito dormir ! 
B-Dubz ! 
Tired =( Thank god for B-Dubz ... 
Find a way to make it through this day/As everything slips so far away/Remember that I remain here to stay/May all the lifeless words dim to gray/Flightless fear fades as I think I may/Have found a way to make it through this day 
Today could not have just gotten any better than it just did !!! only payin 200 for summer classes ! 
I bleed my heart out on this paper for you/So you can see what I can't say/I'm dying here ( I'm dying here)/'Cause I can't say what I want to/I bleed my heart out just for you 
Home alone , bored , in this giant ass house in \wonderful\ " East < PROPFEMALE > . So whos coming to see me ?? "

And we both go down together \ 
We'd stay there forever \

And I'm sorry \ 
This wasn't easy \ 
When I asked you , believe me \ 
And never let go 
And I'm throwing away pictures/That i never should have taken in the first place/And it's cold in my apartment/As i'm changing all the colors/From the brightest reds to grays

Put this as your status if you know someone who suffers from being a Buckeye Fan . Being a Buckeye Fan is a real disorder and should be taken seriously . There is still no known cure for BF and sympathy does not help , but we can raise awareness . 100% of Michigan fans will repost this simply because WE know how to copy and paste . GO BLUE !!
