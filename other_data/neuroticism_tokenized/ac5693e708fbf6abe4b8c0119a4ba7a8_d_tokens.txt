I just lost the game ! 

I can see for < PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE > ! Name that Band ! 
is going to Stenson's place for a movie night ! 
There once was a man from Nantucket ...... 
\You say ' Yes . ' I say ' No . ' You say ' why ? ' And I say ' I don't know!'\ " Name that band ! " 
\Is anybody going to listen to my story ... \ " Name that song ! ( < PROPFIRST > is not allowed to answer ) " 
Since I can't tag people in notes , every one should check my two newest notes . Oh , and I'm going to be gone for a week , bye . 
I have survived the Great Nerd Migration of 2009 
Bought Stenson's desktop , he has a laptop and didn't need two computers . Also , I just got friended by my new roommate . 
i is chekin out lol celebs ! <°\\\\\\>< 
Is makin ' lols 
Is BOOOOOOORRRRRRRED 
Got off work 2 days early ! I don't have to work for the rest of the week !!! 
Needs to assuage his extreme boredom 
Is still really Booooooooooored . 
INTERNET AT LAST !!!!!!!!!! 
I JUST LOST THE GAME !!!!!!! 
Has completely LOST 2 friends ! 
Has a new nickname . My friends on campus have started calling me Ankh . 
We had a dance party in the Meat Locker in Bard Hall 
Round 2 of classes ... Ready ... Fight !!! 
Is getting the band back together . 
Needs to sleep so he can get up and finish his homework before his 1 o'clock calc class . 
Thinks he might be falling for a friend , and knows from past experience that this is a BAD idea . :( 
Still dosn't know what to do about the friend situation . 
Wishes his life would stop getting more and more complicated !!!! 
Just thought of a new nerd joke . What did god say to the flagellant ? OK , OK ! So you sinned , I forgive you , now stop beating yourself up about it ! 
Wishes to remain anonymous . 
wishes it was as easy to take off his masks as it was to put them on . 
Just finished doing his laundry cause he kept putting it off to < PROPFEMALE > out . And he enjoys speaking of himself in the third person ! 
just finished his math homework ! Hooray for not haveing morning classes !!! 
Is pissed at life right now . FUCK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
wishes his life didn't suck more balls than < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ! 
Finally told her and feels SOOOOO much better ! 
Football game , Then get to go back and perform at opening knight . But this = 0 time to eat ALL DAY ! Band = involuntary starvation . 
Is going to watch his kayoss theory DVDs , because he dosn't want to watch Fight Club right now . 
Even though I didn't get a part in the tryouts , through a quirk of fate I am now a member of the \Tribe\ " for MU's production of HAIR !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! " 
didn't sleep last night , and has a calc test at 1 
Thinks everyone going home for the weekend is a sissy !!!!! 
Really wishes he hadn't gone out tonight , but then I don't think my friends could have made it home on their own ... 
Has finally found some peace , and sort of knows where he stands . Hooray for long talks . 
Is tired of pain , tired of work , tired of duty/responsibility , tired of life ... but he is just to damn stuborne to give up , ever . 
wishes he didn't have to do homework ... FUCK CLASSES !!!!! 
Is finally going to do his calc homework , at 4 in the morning . 
Wishes he was more motivated to leave his room , but thinks he will just sit here and refer to himself in the third person . 
Just got back from the collegeiate band festival in allentown . LONG DAY on FOR HOURS of SLEEP ! 
When the pain you feel seems to be the only thing in your reality , your only hope is to smile and look for the irony . -Original 
Has no voice . Made the mistake of going to Hair rehersal and trying to sing when I am sick , bad idea . 
Is sick as a dog , bad cold and an ear infection , FML ! 
wishes classes would just go die . 
is going to go grab something to eat at the cove before his 1 o'clock class . 
I wish that there was some way for me to turn off my pain other than getting angry . Because when I'm angry I tend to hurt those causing me pain , even when I REALLY don't want to . 
' s roomate is gone for the weekend ! FTW !!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Is considering becomeing a hermit 
Had a good time in baltimore seeing The Importance of Being < PROPMALE > , but has to do calc homework now , blahhhhh 
Finished my calc homework , HOORAY ! Now I get to sleep for 5.5 hours ! 
THIS IS A TEST ... OF THE READ ALOUD SETTING ... FOR MICROSOFT ENCARTA ... 
just lost the game 
didn't see the meteor shower , and doesn't give a shit ! 
Wishes that pain didn't hurt like this . Physical pain I can handle , but this ... 
Everybody was kung fu fighting ! 
so far ... today SUCKS , and it doesn't look like it will get any better . 
Accepts facts , and appreciates knowing , but still wishes things could work out differently , and hopes the pain eventually faids ... 
Where in the world IS < PROPFIRST > Sandiego ? 
Sometimes I wonder if I can still feel , and then the pain returns ... 
is bored out of his MIND !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Why do I hurt people ? Why ? 
:'( 
is a sick as you never want to be . 
I feel like I'm perma sick . I have had TWO DAYS of feeling well in the last THREE WEEKS !!!! FML 
I think I have finally ralized why I hurt the people I care about when I don't really want to . It's because they hurt me , but because I keep a cheary front , they don't realize it . And then I get to a point where I am very tired or very depressed/angry and I subconsciously want to make them hurt because they hurt me , and because I'm not thinking clearly , I do something mean or hurtful , and immedeatly regret it . 
I'm thinkin ' Arby's 
Have you seen , my fifteen year-old tattooed woman ? Heard a story , she got butsted for her beauty , ohohoh oh oh ! 
When there's something strange , in the neighborhood , who ya gonna call ? 
I'm going to breakfast ! 
5TH OF NOVEMBER !!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Is this the real life ? Is this just fantasy ? Caught in a land slide , no escape from reality . 
Yesterday , all my trouble's seemed so far away , but now my troubles , oh they're here to stay , oh I believe in yesterday ... 
FML 
As if my life didn't suck enough all ready , my room smells like vomit cause my roommate drank to much tonight , luckily he made it into the trash can . 
Sometimes I wish I didn't suck at sleeping

has finished registering for classes , got everything he wanted . Maybe something is going right . 
Hair opens ... well I guess it's today now , but anyway , it is sold out for this weekend , so if you want to see it , get your tickets NOW ! 
It's really depressing that the only thing I can think of to do between now and call for Hair is my laundry . I need a distraction . 
Hair 2 . I'll be excited by the time I get there . Until then , blahhhhhhhh 
FML to ? 
If they ever tried to make a movie of my life , the Surgeon General woiuld issue a warning : veiwing may cause thoughts of suicide . 
Just got a cracked version of Steam working , hooray for gameing frenzy !!!! 
When I close my eyes , I see your face , and I feel pain . Yet when I wake , the mere sight of you can brighten my day . 
FML^ ? 
fuck meteors . 
You know your getting bad when you go to someone for help , and then freak out at them for saying what they think . Especially when this happens at 5 in the morning . 
Didn't do his calc homework , so he is not going to class . It'll be done by tomorrow . 
I'm actually going to sleep at a reasonable hour , havn't done any homework , but that is what mornings are for . 
FUCK CALCULUS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
has officially decided that milkduds are the food of the gods ! And Hair is sold out . 
Fuck Life 
It should be illegal to be forced to wake up this early on a saturday ! 
If life is like a box of chocolates , then someone gave me a gag box . FUCK THIS SHIT !!!!!! 
Final round of Hair tonight ! Ready ... Fight ! 
Hair is over :( 
Fuck homework ! I haven't slept because I didn't have time to do it earlier this weekend because of Hair , so I had to do it all at once now . FUCK !

Theoretically , if I were to go on a drinking binge right now , should I start with the good stuff or the nasty stuff ? Not that I have either of course . 
I think everyone should check out my new profile pic . 
will be getting texting soon !! YAY ^_^ 
first night back in dorm = first all nighter since turkey break . FML 
When the shit hits the fan , get out of the kitchen . 
I'm bumbed . My game has crashed twice in a row . I think I'll take a break for a bit . 
Gonna try my game again . 
I'm going to bed . 
I like swords 
Fuck sleep ! :( 
Fuck ... my life ! ( in my best impression of < PROPMALE > ) 
you know what ?!? FUCK ! Just Fuck ! 
Just saw this on Texts From Last Night : dude i just made a burrito by wrapping 2 packs of scooby snacks with a fruit roll up . im so high MADE MY WEEK ! 
Has yet to sleep , or finish the work he needs to do , and also enjoys speaking of himself in the third person . 
If you can't take the heat throw shit on the fan ... or something like that .

FINISHED ! class , then sleep . Can barely see straight . 
2 hours of sleep and I'm going to a party ?!? YEAH ! 
A < PROPFEMALE > , by any other name , would smell like feet . 
It's really sad , of all the people I talked to today , 99.9% were over the internet . The other two were my mom and Cube while we played COD4 : MW2 
wow , I've been sitting in my room all day , and have gotten no work done . damn 
WHY !?! Why must my roommate and his friends decide to watch LotR in THIS room . The other guys share a room and have a TV , nobody could complain . 
Another all nighter , they aren't even a strain . I don't know why more people don't have them more often ! 
Why do I feel so goddamn DEPRESSED ?!?!?!?!?! 
You know what's sad , sometimes I actually miss highschool . 
Citamard Night Live was EPIC !!!! And I just discovered that the cheap cigars I bought aren't really half bad . All in all , a good night . 
Now the sun's gone to hell , And the < PROPFEMALE>'s riding high , Let me bid you farewell , Every man has to die , But it's written in the starlight , And every line on your palm , We're fools to make war , On our brothers in arms 
found a Baby Calf on their farm in Farmville ! < PROPFIRST > was tending their cows when an adorable Baby Calf caught their eye ! This Baby Calf is already eager to explore the world on their own and is looking for a new home . Too bad VEAL IS DELICIOUS ! 
I'll kiss your hand . You won't see the smirk , beneath my lowered eyes . Nothing can get wise . All of my children are carrying knives . 
I've never sarcasmed someone into a coma before , but I'm up for the challenge . 
FINISHED WITH CLASSES FOR THE SEMESTER !!!!!!! two finals and I'm done . WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 
Is incredibly bored , and deppressed because he has nothiung to do until friday . I wish I could just take my finals NOW and go home ! 
you know what sucks about not having finals until friday ? Being stuck on campus with NOTHING TO DO while everyone else studies for , and takes , finals 
is playing pokemon red on emulator . All the pokemon profile pics inspired me ! 
can I take my finals now and go home ? PLEEEEEEEEEEEEASE ?!? 
If I only had the words to tell you , If you only had the time to understand . 
I can FINALLY take my FINALS and go HOME !!!!!!! YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY ^_^

I'm bored out of my mind and mildly depressed , anybody want to do something ? or somebody want to talk ? 
\I stayed awake for hours again last night . Searching for a reason to keep up the fight . I've made choices I don't regret . I've got problems I don't get ... \"" 
fuck everything . plain and simple . 
\The only verdict is vengeance ; a vendetta \"" 
Peace is a lie ; there is only passion . Through passion , I gain strength . Through strength , I gain power . Through power , I gain victory . Through victory , my chains are broken ... 
I must not fear . Fear is the mind-killer . Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration . I will face my fear . I will permit it to pass over me and through me . And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path . Where the fear has gone there will be nothing . Only I will remain . 
is bored out of his FUCKIN mind . 
Just downloaded the Rock , Paper Cynic album \Some Songs for Some People\ " . YAY for nerd music . " 
I have a program to write , a paper to write , and a reading to do . All for tomorrow , and I just found out my grandpa died . can this day get any more depressing ? 
I still haven't done my paper , finished my program , or done my reading yet . WOOHOO for productivity ! 
Did the paper , the other 2 can wait 
So I get to be a pallbearer at my grandpa's funeral friday morning and then go to classes that afternoon . fuck my life . 
I am so amazeingly stupid its not even funny , why the fuck do I do this kind of shit . 
Night time , to some a brief interlude , To others the fear of solitude .

I would like to make an announcment : FUCK VALENTINES DAY ! 
Actually might be able to sleep tonight ! good bye facebook , hello PILLOW ! 
Approximately 100% of people who don't believe in evolution don't know what it is . 
The way my life has been going , I sometimes wonder why I don't just roll over and give up , then I remember , I'm doin it for the LoLz ! 
FUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKF 
honestly , I am sick and tired of haveing to deal with this shit ! My roommate is a FUCKING MORON ! 
There are times when it just isn't worth it to be awake . 
It sucks when you want to talk , and the only people you want to talk to are busy . 
FUCK ... MY LIFE ! 
When does silence become a noise ? When does solitude turn to isolation ? When the whisper of another's breath swallows your world ? When do you break the silence ? When do you step out the door ? And how do you find it ? 
My life is fucked , on almost every conceivable level . 
Empty spaces - what are we living for ? Abandoned places - I guess we know the score .. On and on ! Does anybody know what we are looking for ? 
Going on 6 months and I still bleed . DAMN I'm pathetic . 
swords , i wants them 
ok , THIS is AWESOME ! I just heard that < PROPMALE > Nye ( the science guy ) is going to be presenting < PROPFIRST > Hawking with the Planetary Society's Cosmos award in Cambridge UK ! That is enough concentrated science awesomeness to collapse the structure of the universe !!!!!!!! 
Just saw Oedipus . Pretty good , depressing as shit , but it's supposed to be , and they did it well . 
My English class is CANCELED !!!!! W00T !!!!!!! 
I just spent three hours doing sword drills and sparring , I'm dead on my feet . 
I have had 2 hours of sleep since friday morning ... WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 
Just downloaded all of the music to Starcraft , Starcraft : Broodwar , and all the music that has been released sofar for Starcraft 2 . NERDGASM !!!!!! 
Yeah , I can't bring myself to participate in this month . 
Good luck to everyone involved in Secret Garden , I'm comeing tomorrow ! 
WOOT ! Facebook doesn't fail on my parents new computer ! I no longer have to be cut off from the world when I go home ! 
PI DAY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Two by two , hands of blue ... 
My internet is being retarded 
It's sad , so sad , Why can't we talk it over . Oh it seems to me That sorry seems to be the hardest word 
some days it just doesn't pay to be sober . 
There have been a few times in my life wher I seemed to be doing pretty well , seemed to have everything under control . Sadly , this is not one of those times . 
First sleep since Saturday night . WOOOOOOOOooooooooo .......... zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz 
I wish I were normal . 
I wish life would go back to handing me lemons , they smell better then piles of shit , and are so much easier to store . 
I should really write the paper due today at 1 pm . 
Finished my paper , now to goof off . sleep is for the WEAK !!!!!!! 
Sometimes ... life sucks . blahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh 
When you cant run , you walk , and when you can't walk , you crawl ...

I am dissapointed , I went to all the trouble of getting up at 4:30 in the fucking morning to go do Silent Witness stuff , and WBC doesn't even show ! 
this space intentionally left blank 
Here's the everlasting rub : neither am I good or bad . I'd give up my halo for a horn and the horn for the hat I once had . 
I just blasted white stuff all over the dorm lobby , and now it smells real bad . 
is worried out of his freaking mind ! 
Happy 420 to all the stoners ! 
Paper finished ... class finished ... no sleep in 6 days ... zzzzzz ....

I don't want to spend the rest of my life , Looking at the barrel of an Armalite . I don't want to spend the rest of my days , Keeping out of trouble like the soldiers say .

Sometimes i think i understand why i do the things i do , and then i come to my senses . 
another sleepless night . please tell me these aren't going to become a regular occurrence again . 
And what have you got at the end of the day ? \ 
What have you got to take away ? \ 
A bottle of whiskey and a new set of lies , \ 
blinds on the window and a pain behind the eyes . 
you know , sometimes being my D&D groups resident evil mastermind is kinda tiring , but at the same time it's SO worth it . lol 
it's like watching a train wreck in slow motion , and i hate every minute of it . :( goodnight world . hopefully tomorrow brings a solution . 
stick a fork in me , i'm done . 
put this as your status if you know , or are related to , someone who \ 
died in Serenity Valley when the Alliance overtook the 57th Overlanders . \ 
Remember those who were left to starve as the Independants worked on \ 
their surrender . The Alliance continues to kill innocent civilians . They\ 
created the Reavers !! 93% won't copy/paste this . Will YOU make this \

soooooooooo bored . 
Is sad . 20 minutes of solo drills and my legs were already tired . this needs to be fixed ! 
sometimes all you can do is go to sleep and hope tomorrow looks better . 
Sometimes i just want to copy someone's status , word for word , just to see if they notice ...

You know how they say you can never go home ? they're right :(

I can still hear your voice on the trade winds\ 
I can still taste your tears on the foam\ 
But the lure of the tide that I'm feeling inside\ 
Will not rest till my heart finds its home\ 
Now my heart is the heart of the ocean\ 
There are storms on the sea in my soul\ 
I'm restless and deep\ 
And before I can sleep\ 
I must go ... where the black waters roll 
Back on campus and moved in , finally .

No matter what , I'm always here for you . anything , anytime , anywhere , 100%
