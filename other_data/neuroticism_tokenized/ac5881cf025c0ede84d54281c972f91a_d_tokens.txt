It's pathetic that im 19 and I am more mature than middle aged people . 
it's such a hassle getting money to go to school . it's almost a dream crusher when you find out that your still 2000 short for your tuition and thats not including the other 1000 or so in books 
I am soooo happy I don't work at Dunkins 
Life is just filled with too many disappointments 
first day and i already made my bf smell like candles :/ 
ooooooooohhh icy hot :D 
today i found out that it costs more to give verizon the money for your < PROPMALE > directly than it does to put it in a < PROPMALE > paying machine or to mail it ... somethings wrong with this picture 
weekends are too short 
< PROPFEMALE > HAS TWO DIFFERENT COLORED EYES !! lol good times 
I must be weird because all the statuses are about sports and the thunder storms last night ..... i don't like either

So , simba wanted me to fill the cat dish ... it was full , i dumped in three new pieces and now he's chowing down lol

I don't want to go to class :( 
how can a school expect you to learn when your shivering so bad in class that you can't even think ? 
I hate being sick 
Why do I have to pay the doctors two co-pays because they couldn't figure out what was wrong with me yesterday ? 
two more days :D I can't believe it's been a year 
i need a < PROPMALE > dose of hope 
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY BABE !!!!!!! I love you < PROPFEMALE > much ! 
Whatever you give a woman , she will make it greater . Give her sperm , she will give you a baby . Give her a house , she will give you a home . Give her groceries , she will give you a meal . Give her a smile , she will give you her heart . She multiplies & enlarges what she is given . So if you ... give her crap , be ready to receive a ton of shit ! Post on your wall if you agree ... hope to see every female re-post ! 
I hate this 
im craving an iced coffee .. 
Well .... ok then . I'll keep this in mind for the future . 
I don't want to learn about dead guys :/ 
Who wants to research information about < PROPFIRST > Einstein and compare him to a theory of personality ? I know I don't :( 
I FINISHED RESEARCHING FINALLY !!!!! 
I swear sometimes that I live next to a race track .. I wonder how long it will take before someone crashes .... 
OMg little balls of snow are everywhere !!!! \\n*Bad squishy *

Why can't we all live in a perfect world where people like me don't wake up in the middle of a deep sleep only to feel like crap 
Why is it that I have a whole bunch of friends but no one that I want to talk to ? 
i feel like utter crap
