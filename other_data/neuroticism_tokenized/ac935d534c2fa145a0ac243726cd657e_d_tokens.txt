I hate how they always ask , ' What's on your mind ? ' As if there were ever more than two things on my mind . One is Life ; the other , Death . Though to some degree , I am rather more inclined to consider the former . . . . 
Modern views of Zen , in the West , are unnecessarily colored by postmodernist distillations of the Existential movement . Especially in < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > . Most unfortunate . 
People seem to think you have to be alone to be lonely . It's quite the opposite . If one is lonely , it is far easier on one to be alone ; to be alone in a crowd , that is truly unbearable .

A Hindu-Germanic Ksatra-Existentialism for Women . This is my personal substitute for Feminism .

Think Éowyn plus Damayant ?, with a side of Draupad ?. 
' s recipe to a nice life : one part simple-hearted and two parts complex-minded . The resulting human is deliberative to a fault , exceedingly considerate , but lacks nothing in the way of straughtforward decisiveness . Just like a BookEnt ! 
His name was Sayin Türül Tü ( modern , ???????????? ) . So naturally , we called him Sane Turtle Tea , though he should have been Mr. Goodbirth . 
Português e catalão são as melhores em todas as línguas da Europa . Desculpe !

YOU have a right to make ME pay for your healthcare . But NEITHER of us has the right to buy and eat desert , for ourselves . . . . Also sprach die Obamas . 
I start having a problem with moral relativism at about the time that the founder of DIVERSITY , INC . goes on the public airwaves to tell everyone that black tea party activists are like Jewish guards of concentration camps , and then fails to see why the analogy MIGHT not be ENTIRELY appropriate . . . . 
is currently writing a section for her thesis that could essentially be titled , \Why Jesus was NOT a Family Man . \""

My character is not compatible with Buddhism . 
Is destroying minority party signs on public property ? It's not good Ethics , regardless ....

' Evil ' is what you call some BAD that you have given so much potency and has so overwhelmed you that it has taken on a symbolic life of its own . In otherwords , ' Evil ' as a word can mean ' fixed , unchanging ' or ' unfixable , devolving ' . Thus the idea that it can only be ' stamped out ' . I don't know that this is particularly healthy , at the individual level , but it seems to have benefitted the Neoconservatives , for a time . 
If there's a black Jesus , there's a blonde Sita . It just stands to reason .

Kashi is my sweet little peanut .

< PROPFIRST > Locke claimed that children have certain political rights with regards to their parents ( retaining social claims on them , even after they are grown ) . A very odd argument against divorce ensues . 
Thirty-five percent of the SECTIONS of my paper are locked off . These completed sections total 68 pages . It would be stupid to project this number out ( to a total of 194 pages ) , because most of the sections I have finished off ( excepting the Introduction ) are the short ones . . . . 
So , 93 < PROPFEMALE > s and counting . . . . Projected < PROPFEMALE > count , 239 . 
The name < PROPFIRST > . . . from Greek mythology . . . apparently translates to knapsack , in ancient Greek . . . . How very inglorious . . . . Either way , the Frankish name doesn't seem to be related . . . .

Now , more than ever , there is a fantastic need for suspenders . Women need them to keep their shirts from riding up . Men need them to keep their pants on ( not even UP , just ON ) .

A forty-plus < PROPFEMALE > ' dress code ' for a television studio that tells you what time of day to apply perfume ( right after a shower , when your pores are open ) and what time of the week not to eat garlic is NOT A DRESS CODE ! It's television ! They CAN'T SMELL YOU !

As an Aspie and a quasi-schizoid , I find myself once again wondering why agender and asexual people are always overlooked in these overwraught but apparently necessary discussions of politicized sexuality .
