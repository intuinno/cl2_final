It is impossible to live without failing at something , unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all - in which case you fail by default . 
Dear Facebook , \ 
Thank you for letting a hacker get into my account . \ 
And , thank you for making it practically impossible to get back on . \ 
You've really helped me waste an hour of my life . \ 
Sincerely , Pissed Off Me 
a book commits suicide every time you watch jersey shore . 
According to Greek mythology , humans were originally created with 4 legs , 4 arms , and a head with 2 faces . Fearing their power , Zeus split them into two separate parts , condemning them to spend the rest of their life in search of their other halves . <3 
if nothing ever changed , there'd be no butterflies .. <3 
Stunning , isn't it ? :) 
Why does life keep teaching me lessons ? I have no < PROPFEMALE > to learn ... 
We're alive ! The world didn't end ! 
Live by faith , not by sight . 
when nothing goes right ... go left . 
Sometimes , you just have to take a leap and build your wings on the way down ... <3 
<3 The best of kind of love is when you have no expectations at all .. 
If you want to know where your heart is , look where your mind goes when it wanders .. 
I love seeing 11:11 on the clock and not being able to think of a single wish . (: 
Sometimes , words just can't come close ... ( : 
All it takes is faith and trust (: 
It's better to be a failure at something you love than a success at something you hate . (: 
If I fall , can you let me down easy .... <3
