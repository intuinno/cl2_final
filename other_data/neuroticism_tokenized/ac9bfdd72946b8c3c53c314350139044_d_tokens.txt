When life gives you lemons , Throw them at idiots who cant get a clue . <3 
Dude ! Gonna go to the Airport at 4:45 am Thursday ! Gotta stay up ! Sooo cha ! <3 
People tell me to think positive thoughts . But I only think negative when it comes to my own happiness . I want to leave . I want to go far away and act as if it were all a dream . However , I'd be leaving my loved ones behind . But ... Who are my loved onces exactly ? I had a best friend , but she betrayed me . Told me I was something I never was . I can't be myself , not when people judge so cruelly . 
Stupid people don't know how to get over shit . Once its done , just move the hell on and you'll be fine . Don't care if you THINK you cant when its your own fault for holding on . Dumb choices lead to simple mistakes . 
Life keeps moving even when you feel like shit . But remember theres always a pot of gold at the end of every rainbow . This is a good reason to be positive cause maybe you'll be as lucky as the golds new owner <3 
Everythings peaceful for me . NO Drama at all . Ah sweet luxury of Clarksville TN . Ive missed this place , no annoying over dramatic people . Yay ! 
I'm gonna be a photographer when I get out of high school . So goodbye childish people and hello world of perferably New York . Lifes gonna get hard but I've got family 
This is why I hate 14 year olds , they think that its all fine and dandy when someone backstabs them . You know , what the hell ever . They can get the hell over it and move on . Those type of people should be killed . That's all I have to say 
I cant wait to be rid of this place . Its nothing but hell . I mean honestly I hate none who occupy these streets but I dont particularly like them either . ^.^ I miss and love Clarksville . My home is there . Not in this holy hell hole lol <3 Yay for carnivals ! Gonna ride the ring of fire ! 
My hair got cut , Gonna upload some pictures in a lil while <3 Its new but I like it ! OMG ! Imma ride the ring of fire today ! Woooo ! One huge step for Falicia ! 
I'm gonna upload some new pictures tomorrow ... er ... almost today lol 
I miss fort campbell <3 It was the best place i've lived since my dad was instated in the army . Man , I miss the people too . They were all amazing . 
Time to be honest ! Ask me anything you want for these next four days . Gonna be at a friends house , buuut I'll be sure to let cha know once I get on again . But ask anything you want and I'll have to be truthful . But only in messages . 
Trying to find everyone of the old friends I had in Northeast , both Elementary and Middle . I miss them all . Man , life's getting harder then I ever thought it would get . I might just break if I gotta go through this again . I need someone's voice to tell me its okay . Here's my number 931-241-3179 
For once , Life is amazing . He was right , good things happen with time . :) Now I can't wait to see him again . Its been 5 whole years has it ? Wow . Kinda scary when you think bout it <3 
My kitten likes to bite my hand O.o Hes not too nice 
Writing poems and stories clear your mind of all the troubles . Everything will be fine . Just take your time , one step closer to your goal . 
Love is a force more formidable than any other . It is invisible -- it cannot be seen or measured , yet it is powerful enough to transform you in a moment , and offer you more joy than any material possession could . - < PROPFEMALE > De Angelis 
Everything hurts . Whenever my mind focuses on him I think of the distance between us . How our future could've been if I wasn't so shy last year . Heh ... But its all gone now . So lets just hope for a brighter future where it doesn't hurt so bad that I can't breathe . 
When I breathe my last few breathes of life , Will you be there ? When my last sight is determined , Will I be seeing you ? If only you knew how much you mean to me . If only you felt the same . Somehow , your words don't hold the pain mine do , the fear or the joy . Its as if you were a doll . Just sitting there with that damn smile . But in the end , you will never know . 
When you feel like your gonna break into pieces because of a dream , thats when you need to wake up and cry or its gonna haunt you forever . I did that today , I felt the pain rising but not the happiness . Seeing him walk away was the hardest dream I've had . Maybe I should let go ? That's what I've been thinking ... But I just dont want to . I've waited and waited , now I love him too much . 
Life has its ups and its downs . But when you find someone to love you dont really care bout anything but that person . So screw ups n downs ! Life is gewd !! <3 So I'ma keep my smile real and keep my happy days in front of me . Can't wait to go to school . Mess with my freshman friends ! Wooo ! No more freshmeat for me !! <3 Ohhhh ... wonder who can fit in a locker ? >:) 
I have many songs to describe how life has been since I met him to now . My favorite is ... I Go Crazy by : DHT feat . Edmee <3 
Duuuuude Twilight Pick Up Lines suuuuuuck ! ((( No pun intended ))) 
I miss my friends in Clarksville . Wonder if any of them remember me ... I used to be so quiet unless I got mad . Hmmm ... Well theres only one way to know . Cant wait til October ! Mall time during fall break ! Yush ! <3

My new name is ... Falicia < PROPFEMALE>' Sikkema ! Or Falicia < PROPFIRST > Pickett . I am now < PROPFEMALE>'s sister ! buhahahaha ! 
I want some ice cream now ... With hot sauce , nachos and peanut butter . 
Dude ! Open House is the 9th of this month ! Can't wait to see how many people have changed ! <3 Its gonna be exciting ! 
When you realize you have one life to live . You start to think . Wouldn't it be great to let old fights go ? No more hatred . Only the happiness that comes with living . Now , I have renewed my world . I shall hate none but I shall not keep them near . <3 I feel accomplished ! 
Does anyone know when our suckish school starts ? I know its either like the 11th or the 17th . I can't remember . 
Dude appearantly the Open house is the 11th . When does school start then ?? 
Life has its ups and downs but if you focus on only the happiness then you shall have the best time of your life <3

Looking back at who I dated . I can't but wonder WHY I dated them . Theres nothing amazing bout them at all . Nothing that makes me giggle happily because I can't keep my happiness bottled up . But now that I think of my future . It makes me grin . How simple it can be to see people you love . Thats why October is AMAZING ! 
Duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuude ! I love talking to people I haven't talked to since I moved away from my home . T.T \

You gotta love how little pathetic excuses for humans just walk round the school like they own it . Then DARE to talk bout me behind my back . You got something to say , you better say it to my face that way I can use you as a punching bag . Cause honestly thats all you'll ever be good for . Someones little punching bag that doesn't know how to spell to save your life . But whatever your only a toy :) 
Man ... life is amazing . <3 \ 
I love it so much 
Duuuuude ! Theres a nice sized storm coming in ! \ 
So gotta get off . Might get on if it calms down ! Lightning + Computer = ohhhhhhhh shiiiiiiiit lol 
I hate country . :( \ 
It makes me think about life . Cause its usually everything is right 
When life gives you love , you hold onto it for dear life . :) \ 
Because you never know when there wont be a tomorrow . \ 
Quote by : Falicia !!! 
Duuuude everyones pretty depressing today . Why cant they be pumped like last night at that football game . I was glad I went . I got to see my babe . :) 
I LOVE B-Days !! <3 \ 
They are amazing because I get to see my sexy lovers , :) 
Falicia is tired . So Falicia shall sleep in like ... 20 minutes . lolz . \ 
ZOMG ! This week shall be fun !!!! 
Gonna go sleep sleep . goodnight my loves 
You know what ... there are certain crap you DONT do to a person . And telling their girlfriend its over when the guy is so oblivious he can BARELY tie his own shoe is one of those things where I WONT sit by and watch it happen . This is gonna end ... NOW 
Somehow I'm not surprised that this shiiiiiit is happening . Of course its gotta happen with the chick who thinks she can save all her friends from despair . Jeez ... why me is what I wanna ask . But I know why . Because my mommeh made me . lol nah 
whiever started this shit needs to be shot in the foot ... noooooo ... in the FACE because this is BULLSHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT 
Goodnight My Sweets ! I Shall Have A Nice Day Tomorrow ... Or Try To . :) 
When life gives you hell , you get to heaven quicker then ever . Or so I'm told . lol Dont matter either way as long as you live happily and never let your fears stop you . 
Moving isn't too bad . I mean , you get to start over . New life . New home . And New drama lol 
Got my phone taken away til my mom comes back from Montana . Dont text or call meh . If its important then call my house : 270-206-4129 
What are the rules of NorthEast ? I wanna know before I start there . Its confusing going from a religious school to a ... uh ... well an amazing school like NorthEast . My sister went and now I'm confused cause its changed since then . 
Gonna wear a dress Tuesday :) \ 
Have to have fun while I'm still here lol 
Im getting off . This shit is annoying . I have my own problems and honestly no one fucking listens to me so who gives a rats ass whether or not shit happens in their life . Stand on your own feet and get over it ! 
Just think ... Starting a new . No more dramatic people . No more things to give me stress . My biggest problem is what color to paint my room and what supplies I need to do to my room . Thats my new big problem when I move :) 
Thinking of sleeping now . Todays been spent worrying about my future with him . Now I can relax and shut my eyes for another day is soon to arise . :) 
Well the bus comes in like ... 28 minutes . Anyone awake to chat while I wait for thy bus ? 
I have COFFEE !! :) \ 
And cereal !!! :) 
I now replace < PROPFIRST > Gray with < PROPFIRST > Jones ! He loves meh ! lol jk I love you < PROPFIRST > :) \ 
Always and forever >:P 
I wanna dance in the ally with a street lamp nightlight ! :) 
When I get upset over something , I feel sick . Thats what I feel right now . So invisible . Wonder how he'd feel to be invisible for a day . Lets see how he feels tomorrow . Cause I refuse to be invisible to another guy . No matter who he is or who he thinks he is . 
Gonna take a nap . Talk to you guys in a little while . Might be back on . Idk 
Too much drama is what I've gotta say . Finding shit out like this personal attack is slightly annoying . I hate it when Freshman start shit but dont have enough gull to say it to my damn face ! >:( 
My < PROPFEMALE > has a < PROPFEMALE > on it now . Hes not too thrilled with the idea of people knowing where he is appearantly . lol :) Hes sooo cute ! Its a sin to be this cute ! But he tried to eat my sammich ! So he shall be punished with the best method . < PROPFEMALE > kisses and hugs lol . :)) 
Well life is hectic but when you think bout the love you have from your friends and family , and an amazing boyfriend . You start to look for the ups in life . Like taking coffee on the bus even when the busdriver will yell . Heh . Silly Busdriver I need my coffee >:) 
Too much drama . I think my head might explode . lol Bright side ? I get to see him all weekend appearantly :) Yes ! Movie marathon . I want my < PROPFEMALE > to come toooo ... :( She cant though 
You gotta love the fact that when you get your hopes up , you break down when they are destroyed . Tears come and go . Same as boyfriends . Their never forever like they tell us all the time . Never say forever to me ... because your a liar once those words reach my ears . It wont last as long as I thought it would . We wont have time for it to last . I'm sorry ... I wish it was different . 
We got to pretend we were on a slave ship in World Civ . it was interesting imagining the horrid smells , feels and ways of that ship . \ 
But honestly , you gotta feel some pride for those who did manage to live through it all . They were strong spirited . 
When your heart is completely ripped out of your chest with your own strenght ... Somethings wrong . When you feel so sick to your stomach your about to pass out before you even wake fully up . Somethings really wrong . These are the signs of a heartache . Something I hate so badly and something that makes me hate myself even more . :/ 
when you cant think or talk of that person without crying ... you truly are head over heels . when you see that person in the hall and so much pain hits you all at once but then you remember that its over ... you just stand there and force tears back . because your stronger then you were before . you will get through it all . with a fake or real smile . 
It kinda makes me irratated how guys in Trigg , if you break up , they just keep going . Like you never existed . It gets under my skin . But guys in Clarksville are amazing :) I can't wait to be in Clarksville . New beginning . But I'll come back to Trigg ... sometimes 
I can say fo sho that I will NOT miss Trigg :) \ 
I might miss some people but the way people act childishly I shall not miss . Damn freshman lol . :) Nah the freshman are kewliage . But some need to learn to grow up , even we weren't that childish . 
Gonna stay fo hamfest . Well at least that weekend 
I was in love like a fool\ 
A drunken fool\ 
I fell in love\ 
I fell apart\ 
Now you leave me without a heart . \ 
I was in love like a fool . \ 
A fool who thought she knew ... 
:) Life goes on as it was . No drama . Since I'm moving away . No boy troubles . No nothing . Its kinda refreshing 
Last Day Is Tomorrow . Excited ? Not Really . Happy ? No . Nervous ? Yes . Sad ? Totally ! Gonna Cry My Eyes Out ? You Know It ! :( 
When you wanna cry . Just do it . Bottling it all up just kills you inside . :) \ 
So smile when you can . Cry when you want . And always live . Cause one day you'll find your one and only 
my last day was uberly emoitonal :( \ 
I hated crying almost all the day but it felt good to get it out . :) I'll miss you Triggies . \ 
Dont worry I'll be back ... ALOT . Probably for HamFest fo sho ! 
Whose going to the game ?! :) 
Its funny how you think that you'll never come back to an old town that your moving from ... but then you find someone there that makes you laugh like you haven't laughed in a LONG time . :) 
When you think things couldnt get any better . He calls you . I love you < PROPFIRST > . I miss you so much and Im sorry your moms a total bitch who should be shot in the face and spartan kicked down a hill to the pit of doooooooooooom !!!! >:) 
XD Listening to Sexyback . My dog is actually howling to the song . :) \ 
When your life is as crazy as mine , thats when you should go get your head checked lol \ 
Ima be at Hamfest ! ohhhhh yea ! 
Its funny when you look at your cat laying down in front of you , then look down at the computer . Five minutes look back up at the cat and the new puppy is trying to < PROPFEMALE > it around like a toy . :O That poor cat . 
when you dont know your relationship with the guy you like . thats when you need to put your foot down and figure it out quick . or your gonna get hurt . 
When you tell yourself you wont miss any of it . Then you compare it to your current home and area . You start to wonder if it all even mattered . If all those 2-3 years in Trigg were really worth while . The guys you date dont matter in the long run . The people you befriend end up hating you over bullshit drama that they started themselves and the world you came to know shatters with a light touch of his hand . Help 
Good night world . Falicia tis tired and slightly uneased . But luckily I dont have school til next Monday . :/ Thank god for Tennessee laws . 
Amazing how much little kids can drive you nuts . There is only one little kid to whom I will always love . Hes soooo cuuuuuute ! But hes my exs little brother . Awkward ... 
Life goes on and you move onto some better guys . :) \ 
Except you always keep the incidents that happen in the past as something to look over and never do again . 
I love Trigg but I do NOT miss it . Love the peeps but not the imbeciles there . :) \ 
Plus Clarksville has my love . Shopping Mall !! >:) And my lil sis < PROPFEMALE > is here . And more adventurous people . So Trigg , I sincerely let you go from my heart and desires . I have moved on . I hope this doesn't destroy our friendship lol 
Alrightie time go roam the neighborhood for the rest of today lol :) \ 
Talkie later peeps <3 
Hello Face Book ! :) \ 
My name is Falicia < PROPFIRST > Sikkema ! \ 
I love long walks down the street , \ 
Chocolate swirl ice with marsh mellows hot sauce and chocolate Hersey syrup on it . \ 
Also I just love meh some jello ! >:) \ 
PLUS FuFu & FriedChicken are my two bus lovers ! FOREVER !!!!!! 
Me+_______ = perfect couple ! Put this as your status and see who people match you up with 
NEVER catch yourself thinking bout the things that you couldve done with your past relationships . It kills off every bit of pride left in you . Hold onto the futures bright rays not the past . Theres only pain . :/ 
Alright I found the WORST thing that could happen . You like a guy alot and have known of his existence since 5th grade ... Right when you could possibly get him ... It turns out he has a girlfriend . :( \ 
Epic Failage !!! 
Well I thought I was a nerd before , but I am now part of the Anime club here at NorthEast :3 \ 
< PROPFEMALE > is my new anime wife lolz 
Gonna start my poems again . I left them in Cadiz with my ex ... Which I dont mind anymore . Its eh . Life happens :3 \ 
This is the start of something brand new ! 
Writing Poetry at night is fun but very ... sad :/\ 
I know I shouldn't have these feelings but its hard to resist , \ 
I want his touch , his warmth ... his kiss . 
Getting off loves . Gonna go sleep ... or try to . \ 
My dear < PROPFIRST > , you are an idiot . How dare you think you aren't worth a guys heart . Your worth that < PROPMALE > and even more . You will never know how much you truly mean in my eyes , you'll never know how much you keep me sane and how much I love you . You are my light through these darkened days . You are the blood flowing through my veins and my sight in this corrupted world . 
When you fall for someone whose already anothers , \ 
You risk getting hurt or hurting another . \ 
I always chose to do neither and walk away\ 
But now it hurts . \ 
Walking away isn't an option anymore . \ 
I wish it was cause I'd already be gone . 
Duuuuude ! I'ma wear my fox tail to school Friday for the Anime Club Halloween party . Its gonna be epic ! 
Dude , does anyone even remember 6th grade ? \ 
I dont . Well I remember my birthday party that year and the fact that I got my heart broken for the first time . I still remember the kids WHOLE name too . I used to know his number but honestly I dont care . lol . \ 
Such niceness :3

Sneaking to the mall with your mom at like 7 o'clock is fun ! \

Too much drama right now . You wonder why I have so many issues with people ... ugh ... I dont like rushing . That was my one mistake . Neh . Oh well . Life goes on ... 
You know what , Im done with relationships . Whoopity doo da day . Im single and lovin it . Ugh ! How bout this ! Everyone who hates my guts for being a biiiiiitch and apparantly destroying my life , which is bullshit because I grew up not NEEDING a guy in my life ... Anywhoo ...

4 : Pretty good body\ 
5 : Cuteness ! \ 
6 : Obsession with shiny objects\ 
7 : Hyperactivity ! 
I finally found my way on this relationship road to hell . \ 
Now its time to put my < PROPFEMALE > to the test , \ 
Cause I'm done being pathetic bout everything . \ 
My light will shine through :) 
Might be going to the mall with my new big brother ! :) \ 
I love that idea !! 
I'm starting to understand why people say there's only one Falicia < PROPFIRST > Sikkema . Its because even if someone has my name , they'll never be as amazing or as creative . No one can replace me . So all those old boyfriends who even began to think I was gonna be replaced ... F*ck you ! I dont give a damn for petty drama anymore . So if you guys make my life hell , I'll do the same tenfold :) I may be small but I wont be sweet . 
Life is back on track ! :) \ 
I shall be forever in peace now . < PROPFEMALE > doesn't hate me ( completely ) , I have no interest in Valentines because I ish alone ... well not alone cause I have my < PROPFEMALE > ! <3 \ 
But I feel like all the pieces to my puzzle are being put back together ! Yushie ! 
You know I've realized something ... I don't like that many people at this school . \ 
Only the people I talk to a lot . So not that many people . \ 
I honestly hate most of the people in my Spanish ( 4th period ) because from day one they started to judge . And honestly I wouldn't mind smashing most of those little faces into the cold hard cement floor :) But that's not a problem because their all idiots anyway . Cept my friends ! 
Alrightie , Gonna go to the mall with my girlie girl . So see ya facebook ! \ 
* holds peace sign up*\ 
PEACE ! :P
