I need to speak with any1 who has ever lived in LA , or has some intention of going back to LA , or is in a highly compromisable position and could be black mailed into moving to LA . I offer : Very little money , 2 half completed majors , a boat load of cynicism , and hugs . Like bear hugs but waaay better . I am exceedingly good at driving like a race car , I make my own noises and everything , lastly I love problem solving .

Tigers game + Electrocity tonight 
is excited , nervous as hell , and happy . 
I was watching some tivod House and saw where former Tiger's Coach < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > had passed away a week ago . I met the guy a couple of times at a gym in Cordova . Nicest guy , tons of stories , so talkative and full of life .. I really am kind of weirded out by his passing .. awesome basketball coach .. freaking awesome human being . RIP coach . 
Ok < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , hi . Your latest book is big enough to KILL with . I will read your dictionary-esque sized , Dome centric novel provided it is not a complete waste of time . k , thx , bye

Meeting a candidate for TN's District 9 . No not < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > .. The one that's * not * pants on head retarded . 
yep . today did it . modesty gooooooooooone . 
Finally finished ' Haunted ' .. damn < PROPMALE > .. I would recommend the book if reading it hadn't felt like the mental equivalent of drunkenly playing 24 subsequent games of chess . Except sometimes the game pieces are randomly replaced with checkers or thumb tacks or pretzels or war spiders , and your opponent occasionally mails you a friendly post card or brains you with a bat . A mind expanding but exhausting read . 
No Regrets ... well except for spending 3 hours in a 6x6 pocket sized hell where pain was God and < PROPMALE > was Pope . A fantastic first .. seriously , No Regrets . 
If I ace my test tuesday , I'm going sky diving .

A dude , we'll call him < PROPFIRST > , went to a house party . While he was there he mingled and drank some punch . He left early while the party was in full swing . Everyone who stayed at the party and drank a share of the punch died of poisoning . < PROPFIRST > survived . Why ? \ 
< Noooooooo Google > 
A husband ( < PROPFIRST > .. again ) and his wifey are driving fast through the streets of Melbourne or wherever the hell . The car stops . < PROPFIRST > jumps out and asks his wife to wait for a few minutes . \ 
When he gets back his wife is dead and a stranger is sitting in the car . How did she die ? \ 
< Goooooo Noogle > 
needs a pilot and a chute . I earned it dammit . 
< This one might be difficult > \ 
A man in uniform , < PROPFIRST > ( .. a different < PROPFIRST > ) stands on the beach of a tropical island . Looking out over the rolling waves , he lights a cigarette and begins smoking . He takes out a sealed letter and begins to read . The cigarette burns down between his fingers , but he doesn't throw it away . The tide has come in and his feet are wet . He cries . \ 
What did the letter say ? \ 
< Nessun Google > 
Wine , family , Italian adventures , < PROPMALE > Petty . Welcome home < PROPMALE > . 
I look like this b/c I'm from the future . pew pew pew 
So I'm at the emergency animal hospital .. this is such a painfully depressing place . The anguish is palpable , but it is not without purpose .. it is an impetus for hope . 
commencing countdown .. engines on .. may god's love be with you .... ground control says it's time to escape Memphis :D
