If life ended tomorrow , how would you spend ur last days 

Its the weekend and i dont have anything to do . What a boring place to be . 
is missing home right now 
no more mr. nice guy hes gone for good 
Back in Texas 
Can't wait till the next time I can climb a tower 
wondering why every girl i get with is pshco 
is tired of people disrespecting the military . If you dont like us putting our lives on the line so you can sleep in peace at nite . Then you are in the wrong country . 
ask not what ur country can do for u but what u can do for ur country
