I have a taste for duck so trying a new recipe Five spice Duck with Butternut Squash and Broccoli Rabe . Wonder if my friendly neighborhood Kroger will have what I need . If not , then Chinese take-out it is :)

Is wondering what my day will be like today . 
The sun is actually shining . It's gonna be a beautiful day today . So why did I wake up feeling so down ?

Must be the weekend cause it's raining outside . 
Off to dreamland where soft waves , white sand and romantic sunsets await me ! nite all ! 
For Dinner I made a Steamed Artichoke with a shrimp and scallop sauce on rice vermecelli . It was pretty good . 
It's that time of year again in Texas . I dread it . I can handle blizzards , drug dealers on the corner , taking the subway to work , but can't handle the thunderstorms , lightning , tornado sirens . It just scares me . Guess I'm just a wimp . 
has had a very looooooong week . Hope the weekend lasts as long . TGIF

Took a lonnng nap today so will never get to sleep tonight .. Got lots of energy though so will try a new workout plan sent by FB friend . Looks like a good one so I foresee soreness in the morning . No pain no gain though . 
Well its Monday again .... why does the weekend always go by so quickly ? 
I have always believed honesty is the best policy cause it is gonna come out eventually in the end ... so why bother trying to hide the truth ? 
is trying to figure out how my cats , cause I know it had to be a team effort , manage to get into my jewelry box last night- and how did I sleep through it ??? 
really needs a change . This work , home , work , home , work , home routine has really gotten old .

Lord , thank you for my blessings and thank you for my struggles . Blessings provide strength while my struggles keep me humble . 
So I'm moving my exercise bike in front of the TV so I can watch while riding and the floor bar falls off ... I'm wondering what the heck . Then I notice the bolts are just the right size for little toddler fingers to manipulate if not bolted tight . Hmmmm ... my Grandson does like to unscrew the knobs on the shelves in my room . Could this be some more of his handiwork ??? 
Since I have had this headache for three days now I probably should give it a name ....

Yes < PROPFEMALE > , there is a retail hell . I have been in it all weekend .

God works in amazing ways .... I have co-workers from my Par t-t ime retail job calling me to ask me if I can work their shift , because they are not able to for whatever reason . They have no idea what I am going through . All I can say is Thank you God you are looking out for me .... Smile :)

Is the world truly ready for a mini < PROPMALE > ? < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > I know you will be wonderful parents . Maddox is very lucky :) 
Congratulations < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > on the birth of a healthy 10pd 21 inches long baby boy ! 
Regardless of whatever my circumstance I have alway believed in truth , justice , the American way - blah blah blah but maybe I shouldn't ???? My beliefs are being so challenged right now :( Please pray for me because I am starting to feel certain ways and I know it is not the right way to feel . 
I am thinking < PROPMALE > career change maybe Bedford Police Officer , no have to be at least 21 . Oh here's one On Call Pooper Scooper , hmmm good pay but I can barely handle changing my cats ' litterbox , so thats out . Crime scene cleanup , but they would have to hire someone to cleanup after me . so ..... 
Will be working 40+ hrs this week in retail holiday hell while looking for a job . I didnt realize this job search thing was so hard . That'll teach me to try and do the right thing anymore . Nah , who am I kidding , I wouldnt be able to sleep at night if I hadnt . Darn this conscience of mine :) Have a good week everyone and remember be kind to your sales clerk this week . 
Happy Birthday < PROPFIRST > !!! You'll always be Grandma's Baby no matter how old you are :) 
Happy Birthday to my youngest son < PROPFIRST > !!! 
Finally got a job , It is Temp but I am doing my best to make myself indispensable . I really like it and I am learning new things - totally different type business , logistics . Never again will I complain about having to get up and go to work . I am praying so hard that they keep me - not because I need a job but because I see myself there .
