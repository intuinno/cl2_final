< PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > and I are convinced that either our upstairs neighbors are trying out for the broadway musical ' Stomp ' or are keeping a herd of elephants in their living room . Their feet need to shut up .

Martyrdom gets you no where ... some people need to learn this sooner than later . 
When one door closes , another opens ... but sometimes it's not really locked at all . 
Not even a terrible surplus of dialectical journals can ruin this day . 
Best of luck to all my friends at IBH and Koenig going to JUMP today !!! You guys have worked so hard and I know you'll do great ! I miss you all so much , and can't wait to see you soon . Merde ! \

I took the stars from my eyes , and then I made a map\ 
And knew that somehow I could find my way back\ 
Then I heard your heart beating , you were in the darkness too\ 
So I stayed in the darkness with you\ 
The stars , the < PROPFEMALE > , they have all been blown out\ 
You left me in the dark\ 
No < PROPFEMALE > , no day , I'm always in this twilight\ 
In the shadow of your heart\ 
- < PROPFEMALE > + the Machine <3

Procrastination makes me too uneasy to take advantage of the free time . I fail as a slacker . 
22 days ( including weekends ! ) until spring break :) 
\We will dance ’cause you restore the wasted years and\ 
Peer editing can be an adventure when people cross from helpful critiques to just mean :/ Which is why I love < PROPFEMALE > Gonzalez and her red inked retaliations to comments on my English paper :) 
has discovered her fantastic ability to make a disaster of a perfectly clean kitchen . Ah well ; my French 2 class has amazing birthday treats coming their way tomorrow :) 
this has been a fun surprise ! I'm so excited for the recital tomorrow !!

Apparently when I was born , by dad made everyone in the room wear surgical masks to protect me from germs :) I have the best father ever . 
New pointe shoes ( again) ! 
Buc-ees : because who doesn't love chipper , anthropomorphic beavers ? 
That awkward moment when you're hanging out with your brother and people think you're dating ... Josh < PROPMALE > 
The thought of ruining a perfectly good spring break with R&J dialectical journals is depressing ... 
54 school days left until SUMMER ! :) 
All creation moves in a cosmic dance\ 
Before the Lord her King ;\ 
and the rhythm , the reason , the rhyme\ 
of the dance pulses within everything . \ 
And the universe wheels and whirls like\ 
a dervish in perfect seven-step time\ 
The Lord made the Dance , \ 
He taught her the steps , and He causes the songs to shine <3 
has had a most eventful evening .. 
spent all day babysitting in the sun 
has faith that the Lord will reveal his divine plan to her in due course , and that it will be in her best interests-even if it doesn't feel that way . 
Procrastinating :P 
Some children just need to be slapped . Particularly those picking on my little brother .
