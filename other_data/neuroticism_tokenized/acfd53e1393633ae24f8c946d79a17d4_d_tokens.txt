is happy for the new year and is excited for all the wonderful things that are here now and are in the future :) xoxo 

is sad people hated 2009 . She had a year of HUGE growth . The greatest love of herself came through her journey of 2009 . Who she was a year ago is a 180 of who she is now . Forgiven the past and is happy in the now . The greatest love of all is the love you have for yourself . She wishes everyone a happy and healthy New Year :) May everything you want and more be in store for you in 2010 !

thinks Vampire Diaries is helping her longing for the next Twilight movie be tamed . OOO < PROPFEMALE > o sexy ! < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > is < PROPFEMALE > much hotter than RP . 
used to like facebook more , but it just is not the same ... maybe it is time to change things up ...

is sleepy , loves < PROPFEMALE>'s new blog , < PROPFIRST>'s remodeled blog , < PROPFEMALE>'s new makeup , and is so pumped for New < PROPFEMALE > !!! Did she mention she has the new CD and loves it ? 
spending her Saturday night home watching movies with Hot Cocoa . Yum ! 
what what ! The leaves are a turnin ' yellow ! I hold the power of the button that lets people in the door .. mwawaahh haha 
? this time last there were Twilight posters all over NYC , and now .... not one in sight 
saw a lot of airline attendants , pilots , and homemade costumes last night ... very cool 
New York Marathon happening right outside her window . WOOOO 
has a bump on her head she has no idea where it came from , loves the cold weather , feels like a weight has been lifted from her , and is confident in her choices here on out . 
is walking on sunshine ! Cold weather , hot cocoa , New < PROPFEMALE > coming soon , good food in the tummy , and a brighter outlook on life . Yay ! It is true ... those things do pass , and sometimes they need a helping kick out the door . :) lol 
just got a call for an interview for a job she applied for back in June . Go figure . Sometimes things take time . Cross your fingers :) 
listening like crazy to the Glee soundtrack , happy in her very clean room , excited for new beginnings , grateful for today , tomorrow , and everyday , even the bad ones :) a hug for everyone ! 
wants to be like < PROPFIRST > Swift and do a monologue of all her thoughts and feelings . If only the audience were up to it . Hmmm ... 
is sooo happy . Things are coming together . So grateful for all the wondeful people in life that make it so great . Just so so so so happy ! 
just paid $39.95 (the final total after all was said and done ) for a pair of boots that cost $89.99 (not the final total when all is said and done ) at the retail store ! Do not mess with a girl on a boot buying mission :) 
doesn't do B.S. 
needs a love song that speaks of boots that take your breath away , or the sadness inside you feel when a beautiful piece of clothing costs more than a teeth cleaning . No more of this stuff about wishing a guy/girl would love you . How about wishing you had a place to wear a $ 3,000 gown ? Could afford a $ 3,000 gown ? :) 
songs from back in the day make her smile , wants it to be Friday already , and loves that for every worry she has her mom is there to tell her she will have a happily ever after :) 
#& *(@^!) & &*() ! &*(#^ ! (*)@ ! *( ^ *!&* ( 
the best ways to get rid of Moody Mondays , and the past few days of moodiness are to talk to mom , volunteer , talk to Rachie , watch an amazing episode of < PROPMALE > , and be thankful for all the blessings in life that are free for the taking :) 
squeals of little girl delight ! Going home to South Florida tomorrow ! Been over 6 months :) 
has only 3 more days left before she gives her life away for < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE>'s Market Week ... sigh .. lol 
has one extra day then she expected and begins her hardcore assignment Sunday , not Saturday . One day of extra rest never hurt anyone :) 
- smile and the whole world smiles with you . - motivation , not desperation will get you what you want . - the only way to go is up . - family is always there for you , and having even a handful of reliable friends makes life even better :) 
loves that no matter what happens she is part of the Gator Nation and Dang Proud to BE A FLO-RI-DA GATOR because of the most wonderful friends in the world being a part of it with her ! Love and miss you ! 
clocked in 14 hours today . Smiled at < PROPFEMALE > Wintour like a moron as she walked by ... umm how was I to know what she looked like ? At least I know who she is . Fashion is hard . Models are very nice though . Til next Tuesday ... 
had a better day than yesterday . Lack of sleep makes Sami an unhappy girl 
is sharing the secrets of the best products she has used lately . The InStyler- amazing hair , even with light mist outdoors . Urban Decay Primer Potion- I rub my eyes a lot and it still stays ( wish it worked for mascara ) . Forever Makeup Aqua Eyes- gorgeous colors you will get tons of compliments , and it stays ! Love to all :) 
drum roll please ... 76.5 hours this week of working . :) Going back in at 7:30 , then it is over Tuesday .. yay

is looking at old photos ... and is kinda glad she takes them off facebook every so often , so that she has them all to herself , and it helps her make sure she keeps moving forward ;) 
has been a negative person this week , and although the week is not up yet she will turn it around . Looking for hope to < PROPMALE > off the restlessness

feels like throwing a child-like hissy fit .. just cause 
is having a lazy day ... so sleepy and sooo relaxing .. and is now hooked on the real housewives of nyc .. and and and 
feels like the ad as the \after\ " for energy drinks ..... and has this very strange ad on her facebook < PROPFEMALE > of a girl biting into her laptop looking frustrated ... weird " 
stupid American Idol cut off the last few minutes of Glee !!!!!! 
time keeps passing and people and images from the past get fuzzy , and looking ahead is unclear too . The only thing that feels real is the moment I am living in right now ... 
just told the crazy lady that lives down her hall that there is a crazy couple that lives on her side of the hall ... umm 2+2 = 4 .. ooppss

is laughing and laughing ... sometimes for a reason , and sometimes just for no reason at all ... is happy for Laur being home and can't wait til it's her turn ! 
every now and then I miss people from the past , but then I realize there is a reason I left them there ... 
is feeling 
true love comes from loving yourself and then adding the love of others ...

- quit playing games with my heart .... weather ... you're hot and you're cold 
is on her lunch break reading her friend's personal statement for grad school and reflecting on her life . Rejection in any form is difficult , but not making an attempt can be even more heartbreaking . For all those who find themselves in a moment of reflecting on feelings- confusing or clear- just take a deep breathe :) 
is watching Parks and Recreation . Wasn't sure about it at first , but people falling into pits is funny ! 
carving pumpkins with < PROPFEMALE > and watching movies . Life is awesome ! 
job rocks , head cold not so much :( 
is sick and tired ... and yet still super happy with life :) 
is at home thinking about the future ... and thinking that a trip to Florida to perhaps see all the people she misses for Xmas break sounds good , but needs some convincing ... can she stay with you ? 
wonders : Do you ever look back at pictures and think ' gosh I look so fat ' , or ' I wonder where that person ended up ' , or ' they were a sucky friend , but gee I hope they are happy ' , or ... I blame this thinking on the crazy , awesome book < PROPFEMALE > Nethers gave me that is making me think .... a lot 
hugs and people that make you laugh are important :)
