I just woke from an intense dream where wild flowers were growing out of my left elbow . I noticed them while picking up buckwheat walnut pancakes from some place that doesn't exist down the street , and the counter girl who was Indian said thats pretty meaning the tattoo on my wrist but I of course thought she meant the flowers growing out of my arm . Thought I'd share while I am still yawning .

Is wishing he could really state what's on his mind . 
I gave Tucker a dog treat and he ate it , I gave him a second one he went and hid it in the sofa cushions . Due to lack of stimuli he received from the person(hardly ) I rescuded him from he really doesn't like treats , but he is coming around to them and so cute when I was watching him look for a hiding space , when he caught me looking he acted all nonchilaunt and like nothing was going on .

I went to the movies the other day and there was an old man and his dog in the front row . It was a sad , funny type of movie . In the sad parts , the dog cried his eyes out , and in the funny parts , the dog laughed his head off . This happened all the way through the film .

I just realized my Birthday falls on the New < PROPFEMALE > this month . 
DOGS RULE !!! \ 
By simply fetching a ball or gobbling up food on the floor when their owner points to it , dogs , including puppies , show they can read and understand hand gestures . Primates can't make the same connection . 
REACTION TO ANOTHER DOG This test demonstrates that the dog can behave politely aroundother dogs . Two handlers and their dogs approach each other from a distanceof about 15 feet , stop , shake hands and exchange pleasantries , and continue on . The dogs should show no more than a casual interest in eachother . Neither dog should go to the other dog or its handler . 
Any suggestion's for Tucker and me in this area of the CGC test , he gets super excited around other dogs , it is his Achilles heel , yes pun intended . 
When a dog gives you space what is it a sign of ? \ 
A . ) He/She is mad at you . \ 
B ) . He/She doesn't feel well . \ 
C ) . He/She respects you . \ 
D ) . He/She is scared . 
Had the perfect walk with Tucker , got home right as the rain started to pour down . 
Widespread self–deceptive practice is generally called faith . 
The cat ( < PROPFEMALE > ) has taken to marking where the dog ( Tucker ) likes to nap . This must be doing wonders to the hardwood floors under the carpet . So excited about this it's hard to put into words . 
Coolest thing someone asked me today \Why is your dog always smiling ? \ " by a 6 yr . old neighborhood kid while he was petting Tucker with five of his friends . " 
I'm looking forward to begin training the dogs at my local animal shelter . I start Friday . 
Never try making something at 5:40 pm that requires taking measurements when all you've eaten all day is one slice of pizza , it's really tricky . I lucked out the piece left over was long enough . 
Advantage to the rescue !!!! 
According to a recent survey of pet owners by the American Pet Products Association , nearly half of dogs sleep in their owner’s beds . The survey found that 62% of small dogs , 41% of medium-sized dogs and 32% of large dogs sleep with their owners . \ 
Tucker dos not . \ 
Does your dog sleep in your bed ?

Tucker got into the Butter , I've left steaks and chicken breasts on the same counter , but butter was just to tempting . It was a clean get away , sneaky , sneaky , very sneaky sir . 
Got my first road rash Bikejoring , not so bad , couldn't get my foot out of petal strap after seeing a loose dog ( way to many in my neighborhood ) totally my fault .
