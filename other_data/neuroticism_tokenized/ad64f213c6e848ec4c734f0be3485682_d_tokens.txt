Obama is the shepherd I did not want . He leadeth me beside the still \ 
factories . He restoreth my faith in the Republican party . He guideth me \ 
in the path of unemployment for his party's sake . Yea , though I walk \ 
through the valley of the bread line , I shall fear no hunger , for \ 
bailouts are with me . He has anointed my income with taxes . My expenses \ 
runneth over & he has brought our country to the depths of despair .
