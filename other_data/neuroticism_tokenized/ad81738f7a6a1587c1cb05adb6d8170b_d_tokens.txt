won't mourn , but cannot celebrate . 
signed Langston up for a foreign language class . Excited ! 
knows the world is changing ( and fast ) when young school girls are lined up on a fence like hardened criminals . I do hope this is not an omen for the summer . 
my Uncle just gave my little cousin Sardines out of the can . Of course , she headed straight for the trash can . Look , I'm all about tradition , but c'mon---no one born after 1979 eats canned sardines ... LOL 
doling out tough love ain't easy ... 
... late night at the office . Let's see how long I can < PROPFEMALE > . 
is moving ve ee ee ee e ee r r y slowly , but I am moving . 
Post Office . Library . Then , Goodnight .

after watching Toy Story 1 , 2 & 3 for like the 20th time each , I think I like them more than L . Not good news . 
L's w/ Auntie . Guess who's hittin the town with her rollerblades and camera ? 
... my Uncle just gave me a framed picture of me shaking the dust off those rollerblades . Ha ! Okay , I'll stop it with the canned sardines jokes now ;) 
tired . hug the babies . book . bed . 
is heading back to the school with a bus full of toddlers . I'm like them ; I need a nap .

has no business watching \2012 . \"" 
has been thinking about home , my home , our home , disenchanted that it doesn't feel , sound , or look like home anymore . Still here . Still know there's \no place like\ " it . " 
finished running my after-work errands . Now , time to go act my age ;) 
is unusually happy that it's Friday ;) 
thank goodness for this hard rain ... the humidity was ridiculous 
A real poet , like < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > , does not let sweltering , extreme humidity dampen the word . Yes , I think he just may be the Haiku < PROPMALE > ! ( young poet taking notes ) 
My ladies , don't believe the hype ! 
is holding < PROPFEMALE > Henderson hostage for the weekend . The ransom will be high if you summon her anytime before then .

I've started my day with \Mama's Gun . \ " There'll be trouble . " 
L did not want to wear dresspants & tie for the Pre-K award ceremony , but he did it for mama . So proud of my stinka for so many reasons ;) 
Signed . Sealed . Delivered . 
I have been blessed with many male constants . But today , I am especially grateful for my dad , who even on Fathers ' Day , is doing the heavy lifting in my life . He selflessly helped me move into my new place today . I love you , Daddy <3 
found lots of fresh canvases , paint brushes , acrylic , watercolors , oil & charcoal sticks and frames in the basement . Let's hope the new space brings an old love back ;)

So , Langston , has officially completed his first school year . Now , let the summer fun begin ! 
never gets to take daytime naps . so , yeah , good afternoon folks ! 
Early ( too early ) morning errands , lunch with my dad & L , and now I'm waiting for the verizon tech . Sounds like a good excuse to chill ... no ? 
Cinnamon is such an important seasoning ... French Toast time :) 
... babyboy finished his 2nd session of Language Stars . I wonder what his level of command will be like by summer's end .

You know you're in the South when : your windshield wiper gets all jacked up and a nice old man walking on a cane insists on going home to get wrench to fix it for you . Yep ; this is gonna be a good trip ;) 
is writing something other than poems and Langston is letting me . It's the little things .

... nothing like warm cookies , milk and a movie with my little man . Save the carrots and work for another day . 
Beginning phase one of Operation Green Thumb ;) 
is up early with the hornets . Lots to accomplish today ;) 
Why is my child convinced he is Spiderman ? He keeps climbing on random things and squatting with his hands parallel to his feet . 
is thankful for friends who tell you the truth , freak you out , then hug you goodnight . My life couldn't get any quirkier or more blessed . 
This humidity is squeezing me like it hasn't seen me in 3 seasons . Geezus . 
... now begins a long night of revisions , some big , some small . 
< PROPFEMALE > & < PROPMALE > . 
... step outside for a preview of Hell . 
What a huge loss in the passing of < PROPFEMALE > Winehouse . I so dreaded this day . 
I am soooo gonna pay in the morning for being up late messing with photos ... 
It's way past my bedtime . 
is fighting with L about eating his broccoli ... how cliche . 
Songs in A Minor , tracks 12 - 16 are putting me in the zone ... 
The go-kart track , italian , and italian ices to go .... I think L's dad , sis & I did enough bday celebrating for one day . We'll try again tomorrow . That little monster has no idea ... lol ! 
hopes to make magic happen in 2 hours flat ! 
My little sister just told me that in her dream last night , she was trying to say the tonguetwister : \Peterpiperpickedapeckofpickledpeppers ... \ " Kids make the world go ' round . " 
it seems the entire DMV is on the < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > bridge this morning . 
The dear are out and about on < PROPMALE > X Ave . tonight . Langston insisted we ride pass them like three times . He's still cheesing . 
L knows I don't feel well . He keeps bringing me pizza thinking it'll make me feel better . Gotta love him . 
... time to get free 
Big hug to my little brother , < PROPFIRST > Cannon Butler , on his birthday . May all the dreams of your heart and mind come true ! 
Oh , bridge , don't fail me now ... 
much prefers \Ya'll M&%^$*F&$^#%s ... \ " to \ " You people ... \ " anyday though neither is an appropriate way to begin a \ " cooperative\ " conversation . " 
... this batch of baked beans has some serious kick ... yikes ! 
woke up to blinking clocks this morning .... thank goodness for Langston who always gets an inch from my face and yells , \It's wake up time ! \"" 
is not a robot . 
is headed to Borders to let the little boy run amuck in the children's section . 
is up watching babyboy ; he's not feeling well and has been tossing all night . 
Crooks are such an inconvenience to my life . 
is up early showing babyboy his new school ;) 
L and the Best Buy associate are in full Spiderman role play . I swear . 
The guy who's fixing my broken car window is such a hottie ( God Bless Black < PROPFEMALE > ) . 
is finally getting the last of my books in this place . Soon , I'll be surrounded by all my lovelies ;) 
D.C. , we just had an earthquake . I cannot get used to that . 
For folks attempting to reach me , I have my babyboy and we are safe and sound at home . Most of my reply messages to your texts have failed and I cannot get a good signal to call you back . But , we are perfectly fine on the Southside . Love . 
Lampposts , chimneys lean : a kid book illustrator draws a < PROPFEMALE > city . 
I guess I need to get my grandma an FB < PROPFEMALE > since it's the only reliable means of communications in an actual or perceived emergency . Geez . 
< PROPFEMALE > Henderson is about to school me on \Angry Birds . \ " What is an angry bird ? A city pigeon ? " 
This is my idea of perfect weather . Yum .

wishes they would've named this hurricane \Godot . \"" 
has never heard winds like these in my life . 
It's peaceful again . No power loss . I am emptying this tub of water . Feeling fortunate and hoping everyone is doing fine . 
... after the storm , the breeze feels glorious . 
To be with me in the sunshine , you gotta be with me through the storm . 
My baby cousin was shot and killed tonight on the porch of our family home . I have no words . I can make no sense of it at this time . Thank you all for the calls and texts of love and support . My family will need it in the coming days . 
Bright spot : seeing L off to his first day of PK-4 smiling . 
is not made for this .

The sun is out and so is my fro ... 
has so much planning to do ... 
Handsitizer = Hand Sanitizer ( in LangstonSpeak ) 
feels like such a geek . Langston got his first homework packet and I'm looking forward to going home to play with the glue , construction paper , crayons ... all plans cancelled . 
just saw the biggest praying mantis I've ever seen in my life . I dropped my cell phone screaming in the middle of a conversation and it fell to pieces ... Can you say Miss < PROPFIRST > Tuffet ? 
L & I prayed while we were waiting for his doctor . Certainly , God listens to the prayers of children . < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is alive . I hope he's with us until the Creator who rules us all sees fit for him to go . Death should never be the choice of flawed men . Judge , preacher , police , witnesses , mother of the slain officer ... we are all flawed . 
Shame , shame , shame on this country 
Power , in the hands of those who use it in failed or successful attempts to render their fellows powerless , is a disease .
