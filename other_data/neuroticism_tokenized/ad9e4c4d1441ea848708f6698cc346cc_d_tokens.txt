Daddy's Arabian , Cometsmist , was layn down this morning when we went out to feed . We tried to get him up but he just won't budge . He isn't colicing , but he seems to have a problem with his left front leg Bcuz he wouldn't use it at all . We managed to roll him over and get him off that leg a few minutes ago and he is using it a little more but still won't stand . Dad says we have to just see how he is in the morning . 
Well , Comet didn't make it . We had to put him down a few hours ago . He was an amazing horse & he will be missed . :'(
