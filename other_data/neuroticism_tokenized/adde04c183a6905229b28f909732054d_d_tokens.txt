Twisted thoughts in a twisted mind . When will this pain ever ...... oooohhh a PUPPY !!!! ... :P 

I remember , when all the Idiots and Whores , stood tall like Matadors . 
i'm your knightmare in shining armor , BRINGING HORROR ! 
Way too much coffee + way too little sleep = stomach evacuation . 
I am the twilit < PROPFEMALE > , beautiful to behold , but beware the deadly thorns hidden by the dark . 
just when you think life is starting to go pretty good , it pulls out a broom and sweeps you back under the rug . 
when the lights go out , and you are snug in your bed , she will come to your dreams . 
Hates bastards who use glitches to win in online games . They have no skill and can only win by cheating . 
Just found out Osama bin Laden is dead . Well , there is one less asshole in the world , only a few million to go . 
I think today will be a day of fecked up songs . 
When the world turns it's back on you , nobody cares , no sympathy nothing . When you turn your back to the world , you are accused of every crime . -Vindaru Devoness 
just beat assassins creed 2 , can't wait until 3 is out . 
The greatest \trick\ " the \ " devil\ " ever pulled was convincing the world that he was god . " 
When the past haunts your thoughts , the future seems so narrow . 
I just love the sound of gunshots down the street . 
Comfort is in the arms of misery . 
When life gives you shit and yet more shit , you can either wallow in shit , or build something out of it . Either way , it's still a shiity situation . 
Beware the caress of the twilit < PROPFEMALE > , whose cold embrace voids the heart . 
friday night magic 
The wind blows my dust away . 
just love having drug dealers for next door neighbors , the gun fighs every weekend are just aweome . 
I break myself to dethrone my soul .
