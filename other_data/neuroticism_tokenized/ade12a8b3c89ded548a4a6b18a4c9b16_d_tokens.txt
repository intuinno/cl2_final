Smart listens to the HEAD . Stupid listens to the HEART 
Smart may have the brains , but stupid has the balls ..... 
You don't love someone because of beauty . You love them because they sing a song only you can understand .... 
Do you remember the nights \ 
We'd stay up just laughing \ 
Smiling for hours \ 
At anything\ 
Remember the nights \ 
We drove around CRAZY IN LOVE ... \ 
\ 
We made our way dreaming \ 
Hoping of being \ 
Someone big\ 
We were so young then\ 
We were too CRAZY IN LOVE ... \

doing accounting homework then work at 3 to 10 what an exciting day ! lol not really but at least i'll hopefully be caught up in accounting ! i'm crossing my fingers !! 
you know the feeling you get when one minute you had a great day and had all your friends then in next it's get taken away just by a blink in the eye ; and you're left with nothing . if you don't feel is way you're lucky . i can't believe how one year could change < PROPFEMALE > much , usually i like change , but this change isn't what i was hoping for :S can it be a new year already ?! 
woke up this morning to take my friend home , when we were walking outside it was icy and when i saw my car i notice that it was all frosted over ... ah the first signs of winter approaching ! isn't it swell ?! 
can't not believe that thanksgiving is 2 days away ( not counting tomorrow since it's almost here anyways ) and christmas is around the corner , i haven't even begun my christmas shopping , though i know what im getting my rents , brother , his gf , and my adorable niece ahna !! lol now i just need to figure out what i need to get my close friends . hmmm , let me see what to give them ?! any suggests ( girls i'm talkin to you ) 
can i just say i give up that you win , that if you don't want to be friends fine . god i hate this year i lost a dear close friend and i seriously don't knw what i did to make you this mad at me , whatever it is it better be a good reason to not want to talk to me . i'm officially done trying and that i'm done with you looks like i'm working on this Germany project by myself :'( i really need a hug right now 
Maybe you're reason why all the doors are closed so you can open one that leads you to the perfect road like a lightning bolt , your heart will blow and when it's time , you'll know 
though thanksgiving is tomorrow i figure i should tell everyone what i'm thankful for this year : 1 ) My niece Ahna ( she's the most amazing little girl and i'm < PROPFEMALE > glad to have her in my life ) 2 ) My family ( though sometimes it's still questionable that i'm adopted :]) 3 ) My bffs and my dear friends ( < PROPFEMALE > Bartels , and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > ) 3 ) TOKIO HOTEL and Lastly peace , <3 , ? ? ?!!!!
