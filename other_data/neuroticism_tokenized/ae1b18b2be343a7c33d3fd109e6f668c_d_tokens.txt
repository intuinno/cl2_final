\To love is to suffer ; to avoid suffering one must not love ; but then one suffers from not loving ; therefore : to love is to suffer ; not to love is to suffer ; to suffer is to suffer ; to be happy is to love ; to be happy then is to suffer ; but suffering makes one unhappy ; therefore : to be unhappy one must love ; or love to suffer ; or suffer from too much happiness ... i hope you're getting this down . \ " - Woody < PROPFIRST > "
