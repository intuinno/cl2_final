is measuring murmurs in mental mud . 

I'm gonna make that boy pay for my ice cream . 
COFFEE . SYS Not Found : User startup disabled . How will I see through all things with my half-shut eyes ? 
is missing the Sand < PROPMALE > Comic Con . So bummed . 
bought a helmet and biking gloves and is getting pumped for the epic bike ride to work . 
hating that 5:30 AM exists 
Trans rally , bike film fest , cat fish , possibly b-side , krayonz , meander about on my gyration machine ... I'm determined to be social , dammit . 
Trans rally , success ! Film fest not so much , got times screwed up , cat fish ! the rest is TBA ... 
Cat fish ... is lame 
Yesterday ended with chillin with the bois+ and Catfish over at < PROPFEMALE>'s ( happy birthday ! ) then coffee , cute baristas , a delicious vegan cookie and some kick ass tunes at the Grind with Napalm and Krayonz at 2AM . 2AM bike ride FTW . Note : Must be social 
\We were all just the bastard children of Abraham ... civilizations with daddy issues\ " - < PROPMALE > H . ( I love this man ) " 
is not looking forward to the incipient bedlam 
I'm getting sick of ER visits . 
Everything kicks ass right now . 
Got some size 3 jeans this week , which I could give a shit about ( it's only a size lower and I wasn't attempting to go down ) but I realized today that the last time I saw the number 3 on my jeans was when there was a 1 in front of it ( way , way back in the day ) . Quite the size difference . 
BF & I visited Oly this weekend . Went through some OLD photos of < PROPFIRST > & me . I enjoyed the look of horror on BF's face upon their viewing . The ONLY semblance of me from the photos were my eyes . The chubby , punky , long ( but badly ) dyed hair look was terrifying ; however , due to mid-twenties induced face weathering & salaried job , I began to feel old & missed it ... I quickly snapped the hell out of it 
Oh insomnia , how I missed thee so . 2 hours of sleep to aid in preparation for the incipient 9 hour day ( preceeded by an hour long meeting ) . My old friend caffeine better pull through . 
Deadlines are a threat to the sobriety of the recovering workaholic . 
Saw the Rural < PROPFEMALE > Advantage at Backspace on Friday . So good . Opening bands , not so much ( Monarq was ok I guess ) . Totally made up for missing Zero 7 last week . 
Another Ice-9 come and gone 
I'm one creative mother-beeeeeep ! 
Has a day off ! And as such is watching 30 Rock , smoking hookah and drinking coffee . 
Eating Thai style rice w/ broccoli ( made by yours truly ) in Oly with the boys . Back to PDX to par-tay in 30 mins & counting ... 
14 hour shift on 3 hours of sleep = 5,000 % booooo ! 
It's now a 15.25 hr shift and I open tmorrow ... Booooo ! 
The Mr. Show marathon on IFC is making my AM shift worth it . 
\Insanity is often the logic of an accurate mind over-tasked . \ " That about sums it up :/ " 
And so begins the 3-day , raw veggie juice + herbal tea and water fast ... Going to get some sun , exercise , meditate , clean out the damn guest bedroom and start writing/recording . Booya ! 
drinking a master cleans of lemon juice , < PROPFEMALE > syrup , sea-salt and cayenne pepper ... who wants a kiss ? 
Has a scheduled interview , a voicemail to schedule an interview and a request for an application to be filled out after sending in my resume . ( one of the jobs is similar to what I'm doing now with mental health , but with a little higher pay and working in a BIKE SHOP ) Booya . 
Got a ninja for xmas and made some bitchin hummus . 
Interview went well yesterday , got another one tomorrow for a dialectical behavior therapist position . Fingers crossed . 
Interview for dialectical behavior therapist position went SO well . Not only will I be working w/ at-risk , female youth-getting a CADC-I is required , they pay 1/2 the fees & the hrs worked on the job go toward the 600 hour , field work requirement . Then I'd be certified to hold drug & alcohol group-therapy sessions . B4 I got home they'd already called 1 of my references . Holy moly , I want this job SO BAD . 
Got a call back today at 3:51 PM from someone in HR who apparently needed to ask about something regarding my application , but they'd be out of the office by 4 . Guess I gotta call tomorrow . Blerg . 
Aherrrm ... I am officially the new Dialectical Behavior Therapist at the treatment facility I interviewed at on Wednesday ! Booya ! AND < PROPFIRST > is a-makin ' me breakfast . And again I say , booya . 
Working full time , going to Portland State University just under full time ( finishing up the bachelors ) , working on my alcohol and drug counseling certification while trying to plan a wedding and lose 5-7 pounds ( would like to be size 2 by the wedding ) . Meanwhile the clients at my treatment center are going APE SHIT and I'm convinced at least half of them need an exorcism instead of group sessions . 
11 hours between urgent care and the ER/OR yesterday and 4 more hours today . < PROPFIRST > got appendicitis . FYI people , pain doesn't have to be sequestered to the right side to be appendicitis ( why am I always right .. ) . Also OHSU's cafeteria is the shit . Low cal vegan options out the ass and fair trade organic coffee with soy creamer . This morning I was also able to get vegan VooDoo donuts . Bitchiiiin ' . 
Finally home . Carpe nap time . 
Got an 87% on my psych test :/ I guess it's not bad for not really getting a < PROPMALE > to study since my < PROPFIRST > was in the hospital . Got a 100% on the quiz though , so that brings me up . Now it's protein shake then minorities class , lunch with < PROPFIRST > , psych class , home again home again and then some Pied Cow with Lady Ceej . 
School , coffee , more school , vegan food at HT2 , more coffee , scenic visit to a water buffalo ranch , Burgerville , < PROPFEMALE>'s house for a partay , home by 12:30 to finish my taxes that got effed up . Nice way to wrap up a 3 day sabbaticle 
Breakfast and a record show with < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > yesterday ... today : test , coffee , lecture , coffee , hookah and perhaps yet some more coffee ... maybe some random frolicking 
I got facebook on my phone ... I'm now that guy . P.S. I rocked my Soc . test today 
It was in fact , coffee , test , coffee , class , bike ride , coffee and reading at Sweetpea , hookah and chess in the park , now watching \Men Who Stare At Goats\ " which is hilarious . Good day . " 
( 2/2 ) in my coffee corner 
Got a 100% on my in class quiz . Uuuuh , n-na-n-naaa .

< PROPMALE > and Styner have ARRIVED ... well , yesterday but , still ...

( 1/2 ) Lunch with < PROPFIRST > on Mon , $1 pbr's & ( vegan ) corn dogs last night @ HT2 w/ another couple , coffee & Thai food today w/ < PROPFIRST > & later some 40 cent tofuffalo 
( 2/2 ) wings & $2 coors w/ some friends @ HT2 ( again ) ... CONCLUSION : I'm getting better @ this whole social thing . 
Brunch with < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > this morning brought my social week to a close because now I'm home from work with a slight fever and a really bad sore throat :-/ 
As soon as I start feeling better I burn my hand ( blisters ! ) by being a DUMBASS . Anway , for those who find catharsis in defecation , go vegan , I poop like a cat . 
Reason 1,563 why I love my partner : \Sometimes I wish the cat could pick ME up . \"" 
Health = better , Work = hectic , School = overloaded , Wedding Planning = time consuming , Social Life = still kickin ' it wicked ( Last night- HT2 for $1 vegan corn dogs/PBR's and then The Know for some $2 Iron Cities and pinball with < PROPFIRST > , < PROPMALE > and some other random kids ; Tonight- HT2 with Teh Ceej for $ . 42 tofuffalo wings , woot ; Tomorrow- road trip with < PROPFIRST > to Oly to see the boys for Will's b-day ! ) 
Thanks to Ceej for taking my measurements today . Awesome bike ride back home ( haven't driven in like 2 weeks ) . 
Fun night last night . Went to the preview of \Get Him To the Greek\ " with < PROPMALE > ( and friends ) ... I walked in with really low expectations and it ended up being hilarious . Then some HT2 for tofuffalo wings with everyone and back to my house to watch \ " Drop Dead Gorgeous\ " which is still a classic (\" His furniture's as fake as my orgasms ! \") . " 
Psych final today . Wish me luck and wish it fast . Let's hope my semantic memory and encoding don't fail me . Suck it chapter 7 !

Dear fruit flies that decided to move in whilst we were on holiday : Buzz now , you bastards , but my < PROPMALE > jar trap of vinegar and dish soap along with frequent bleachings down all our drains will have you wishing your absurdly short lives were even that much shorter . And get off my f@#$ing coffee mug , I'm using it ! Yours Truly , Your Invariable Destroyer

Now for a less tumultuous , 5mi ride to school for a 3hr , 40min psych class . 24 , carbon free , uber calorie burning < PROPMALE > in one day+vegan goodies & my main squeeze ..

Experiencing the nocebo effect . 
Missing Zombie Walk again ! It had to be on an f'ing school day ... gah ! That's it , I'm doing my own . Even if I end up walking around downtown , dressed up , by myself ; somehow , I WILL walk these PDX streets bloody and grunting ... I don't think that's too much to ask . 
Beethoven's Piano Concerto No . 5 helps the behavior analysis go down and is serving to chill out my cat . 
Skipping out on my ( optional ) graphing calculator tutorial class for stats . Once a badass always a badass I guess . 
It's official : If < PROPFIRST > can stay out of the hospital for more than 4 months , we're throwing a medical themed party at our place . Come adorned in hospital gowns , scrubs or as any of < PROPFIRST>' various afflicted orgins ( someone already has dibs on a testicle costume ) . 
1 ) Visual analysis of single-subject experiments kicks statistical research's ASS ( correlation only goes so far ) , 2 ) The Skinnerian learning model is such a better way of absorbing the material and APPLYING it , 2.5 ) I have a cold :( 
So . done . with . stats ... brain . fried 
8 consecutive hours studying-CHECK ; 1 < PROPFEMALE > of formulas , theorums , graphs and probabilities-CHECK ; 1 graphing calculator-CHECK ; 1 number 2 pencil w/ 5mm lead-CHECK ; Sanity-CHICKENSALAD ...

Ok , conscience , you win . I voted ( mostly progressive and a couple write-in's for < PROPFIRST > Walkin & Lady Gaga ) . 
Driver's seat dance party , mobile banking and traffic jams ... Peas and carrots , kids . 
So much school work . I wish it was bed time ( and by bed , I mean ethnic and by time , I mean cleansing ) 
Small minds think alike and it's f'ing everything up . Rabble , rabble , rabble . 
I wish I had a lithium dispenser ( kind of like a pez dispenser , maybe in the shape of a brain or DSM-IV < PROPMALE > ) . 
So . much . slappy . cakes 
Found out I got a 76 on my stats midterm . Considering I was going to be ok with a 68 , I'm as elated as a m-f'er . Let me hear you say uuuuuuhhhgggg !!!!! ( na-na na-naaa ) 
Creeper sexist+homophobic ass-hole who I threatened to kick out+masturbating sex offender who my boss kicked out = one SHITTY night . Luckily my boss came in and we had an after hours dance party to ease the tension . 
Friend Thanksgiving round one , 4pm @ PB&J's . I'll be the one with the tofurky and killer , vegan , mashed potatoes and gravy ( 12 pack of PBR in tow ) .

night , but this time I'll also be bringing vegan biscuits and vino . 
HORK ! 
Happy over consumption day . Nothing says \giving thanks\ " like stampeding over your neighbor to be the first one to further your credit card debt . That'll get us out of a recession . " 
I haven't named my bike yet ( I know , bad luck right ? ) . I was thinking something commanding like \the chief\ " or \ " the enforcer\ " or perhaps something Greek-inspired like \ " propelius maximus\ " or \ " beauteous apparatus\ " ... something alluring and sexy like \ " black tart\ " or \ " vixen\ " ... maybe a made up word like \ " horkdickel\ " . I don't know . Suggestions ? " 
Got my paper back in my psych class that accounts for 20% of my grade ... A , bitches ! 
Ok , finals week is here . I will be deeply absorbed in studies and thus essentially nonexistent until 12/9 . Wish me sanity and accolades . 
Last final is tomorrow , but one thing is on my mind : < PROPFIRST > Kong or Costa Rica ? ( not until Summer of course ) Hmmmm ... 
It's shorts weather in Portland right now ... I feel weird .

Top 5 Resolutions : 1 ) If smoking , only smoking shisha . 2 ) If drinking , only drinking wine . 3 ) When eating , never eating deep-fried . 4 ) Go to Costa Rica . 5 ) More lip balm and less nervous lip picking 
Amazon.com just saved me 80 bones on school texts and Miley < PROPMALE>' resolutions are front < PROPFEMALE > news on CNN.com . Oh the digital age , how I love/hate thee .

Time to get motivated to make a study guide for the exam in my Motivation Psych class on Friday ... approach approach approach ... ljhshfjbhdb . 
I just did a british , kick-boxing , work-out video where he referred to the cool down as \trying to calm your fun burner \""

Uhg , I'm happiest when < PROPFIRST > and I are traveling . This Peace Corps thing is happening after graduation . I need stimulus that only planes , hostels and foreign languages can satisfy ! 
< PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > , you remind me of a Westside story . 
Ode to back pain -or- I just found out that a full keg , on the low end , weighs almost 20 pounds MORE than I do and thus it was a BAD idea to lift one all by myself last night at work . It did make me feel pretty hoss , though . 
96 on my response paper ... thank god , it took long enough :-/ 
I would have gone to the Thursday show , but I didn't want to get tears and wrist blood on me . - < PROPFIRST > 
I think I just saw Bjork jogging down Powell ...

Finally moved . Hello downtown living , walking to school and a kick ass view of Mt . St. < PROPFEMALE>'s from my balcony . 
And this is why I hate group projects ... yeah , let's use a theory in our proposal that has absolutely no empirical evidence of actually supporting our client's motivational deficits . Let's do THAT . Rabblerabblerabble . FINALS . rabble . 
I love that some social psychologists are now referring to cults as \new religious movements \"" 
Can't sleep any longer ... anxious visions are persisting in 12 pt , times new < PROPMALE > font . Time to turn this shit it in . 
need ass to be constructed of less bone in order to withstand the massive amount of time spent on this damn stool studying

Operation Purple Rain at the High Rise a success . Blueberry/pomegranate mimosas and margaritas for the win .

Beer floats ? With coconut ice cream ? Yes please . 
Man Man , Yeasayer , Dropkick Murphys , Cave Singers & O'Death + 16 hours at PSU = busy Spring quarter 
I'm predicting that walking up the hill to my apt 3x a day ( going back/forth to school ) plus the insane amounts of bike riding done during the dry months ( on my single speed ) is probably going to equal my thighs hulking out of my skinny jeans around mid May . I've not yet decided to use this for good or for evil ... 
I'm sure one day I might start liking children ... maybe ... but until then I'd like there to be some sort of rule stating that , at restaurants , I'm to be seated at least 30 feet from families with more than one child and at least 60 feet away from babies . 
Now that I have the flu ( AGAIN ) , I'm trying a different tactic this time around : off brand , diet , orange soda and Grapevines . 
There's a < PROPMALE > in < PROPFEMALE > requiring women to file a police report after a miscarriage ? Is there any way we can evacuate the few , choice , non-idiots , build a giant wall , then make the south its own country and find some way to make sure they don't breed ? 
Doc says it's either pneumonia or viral bronchealitis ... blerg .
