just bbq'd some damn good chicken . 

Going to the field in the morning . Nothing like tent city and port-a-johns to get me motivated to march 26 clicks . 
Ever . Counseling brain fried . 
Another day , another dollar . Make that 10 cents instead . Need to get promoted . 
How many zombies can < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > kill with one roundhouse kick ? 
Looking forward to my bonescan in the morning . Need technology to tell me that I am getting old . 
stress fractures in the knees . Not allowed to walk even for pt . Old age sucks . 
One more hour of cq . My body is trying to melt into the couch . 
HUSBAND & WIFE WEEK - If you have a mate who is your best friend , who has been through thick and thin with you , who LOVES you even when you're at your worst and whom you are PROUD to be married to , copy and paste this and the date you got married .......... Jan 21 , 2006 
My alarm clock and me aren't on speaking terms right now . It yelled at me this morning so I hit it . 
My god !! I am only one person and I have like 9 jobs right now with no assistance . Trying to get five minutes to breath . 
Will these doctors make up their mind . Stress , fractures or not . At least I have a short week and no crutches . 
Disregard , I didn't know you sold it to the Curry's . 
First I was too young to have a colonoscopy now I am too old to have chicken pox . I am having a crappy month .
