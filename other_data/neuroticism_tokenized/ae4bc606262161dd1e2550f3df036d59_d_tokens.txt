Family are now facebook friends . Hi , family . 
Ralph : hahahaha fag hahahaha farts hahahahahahahahaha faggot ! \ 
Me : Shut up .... 
Not the greatest day . Cuddles would be nice right now . :( 
Strongly implied words speak louder than actions . 
Just watched the new < PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland . It was good , but they may have been trying a bit too hard . =/ Though < PROPFIRST > Fry was awesome as the Cheshire Cat . ^_^ 
It's pouring outside . Who's for a sitting in the rain party ? 
Today is a great day . I am happy . :) 
Q : \Why did Jesus never go to bars ? \ " A : \ " Because he didn't want to get hammered and hungover ! \ " Hyuck hyuck hyuck ! " 
Only got to see half of Avenue Q due to complications . But it was awesome ! :D And yay for youtube vids which pretty much let me see the first half anyway . ^_^ 
At my wife's house . New computer charging . Wife asleep . It's chill time . :) 
I don't know who you think you are , but before the night is through , I wanna do bad things with you . ( God , I'm loving the theme song to True Blood . ) 
Modern dance classes teach 10-year-old girls that it's okay to dance and dress like 21-year-old women . I can't help but disapprove . 
Naptime ! 
Just had a serious talk with Brittnie about college . I think I got through to her . I at least scared her a little and made her think , which is a definite step . 
Shit shit shit . I'm bordering broke . -_- Shit . 
Let's think about happy things ! Like kittens ! Christmas ! High-carb foods ! Being in love ! Yeah , I feel better now . 
Mom called me < PROPFEMALE > today . 
This album is FOXY . ( Shazam ! ) 
Had lots of serious conversations today . It was very interesting and really fun . I'm happy with how it turned out . :) 
< PROPFIRST > is giddy in his boots . 
Want to learn Beatles songs on ukulele . They're hard . But it'd be awesome if I could pull it off . 
Just set my Facebook language to pirate . * gigglefit * 
Nobody's online ... am I missing something ? 
Gonna see < PROPFIRST > today ! Yay , Excited ! 
I feel like I've accomplished something today . Maybe I'll go to the attic and dig through my stuff later ... 
I'd like to be somewhere quiet now . -_- 
O < PROPMALE > home . I've missed you . 
It amazes me , the speed with which I start wanting company nowadays . Dear God , I'm becoming human . 
Holy crap , my siblings start school on August 11 . Would like ... [/NERD ] 
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh , I'm a mess ! 
Brit's listening loudly to her mix CD I made her . I am happy . 
I don't know if any of you have webcams , but if ya do , I have a Skype now . Add me - sonicstopwatch 
Just watched Avatar . My verdict : Thank God it's finally over ! 
Jesus . I'm such a dork for < PROPFIRST > . <33 We've officially been together 4 months now . My life rules . 
My tax/financial aid woes are yet incomplete .... 
Ticketmaster said I could transfer ticket names . Whew ! 
\You're silly . \ " \ 
would like a hug , please . :( 
feels terrible . It's not a good day . 
watched Pokemon with < PROPMALE > and Brittnie today . We're awesome . 
I don't even know what I want right now . 
This is the best I've felt for a couple of days now . Thanks , baby . I love you . 
had a dream about singing Fidelity ( by < PROPFEMALE > Spektor ) with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Armstrong and then having him share his Halloween < PROPFEMALE > with her . It was awesome . =D 
Were I an employer , it doesn't seem a far stretch that I would refuse to hire someone on the basis that they spell \a lot\ " as one word . " 
If there is a god , I think he really loves me . I have an amazing family , awesome friends , and a fantastic boyfriend . I love you all very much , and thanks for being here . <3 
Cutest Pokemon : Vulpix , Charmander , Pikachu , Psyduck .... I want to hug and cuddle them all ! 
I don't need to be < PROPMALE > , but I would love to just not be poor . -_- Stupid LSU with their stupid fee bills ... 
* takes a deep breath * I got an extension with LSU . That was a nerve-wracking 20 minutes . 
is waiting for the money < PROPFEMALE > ... I don't think she's coming . 
Green Day in a few hours . Whoo ! I hope < PROPFIRST > feels less crappy soon . <333 
This morning was crappy , but Green Day was absolutely amazing . I was entirely composed of sweat and happiness walking out of that venue . Would do over and over again . 
Listened to during today's car ride : Foxy Shazam , The Matches , The Network , Savage Garden , The Clash ... one of these things is not like the others , one of these things just doesn't belong ! 
Holy crap . Lots of people are online right now . 
Oh my god . My arms are tanned from that Green Day show . I don't think I've ever had a tan before . Holy crap ! [/shock ] 
My financial aid finally went through ! Hells yes ! 
Playing monopoly with < PROPMALE > and Brit . Because I'm cool . 
is unexpectedly nervous about leaving . I've been wanting to be active all summer , but I know I'm gonna miss home a little bit . I love you guys ! Time for school again . 
Work is slow . Will came in but left . I'm bored now . 
Moved in . School starts soon , yay yay yay ! 
Work is slow . As long as I'm able to play my music , this should be okay . 
Foiled by Blue October is an amazing album . Fantastic instrumentation , beautiful lyrics , and I don't even mind the hidden song on the last track because it feels like an extension of the album and doesn't throw anything off like hidden tracks often do . I say all this because I'm bored at work and just listened to this album . Love . <3 
First day of school as a big bad sophomore ! Yay , I'm not the youngest anymore ! 
Good classes , good friends , sufficient food . Good day . 
Was hungrier than I thought coming back from work . Ate 2 hot pockets , a sandwich , and some chocolate . Hopefully I get less 1:30 - 6:00 shifts . xD 
Good day . :) <3 
History class is kind of funny after having taken an entire class on the stuff we're skimming over right now . Not in an amusing way , more a know-it-all way . 
I woke up way earlier than needed this morning , and I feel perfectly fine . Looks like I have time to do stuff before class today ! :) 
Being in love is one of the greatest things in the world . <3 
Just realized I read 8 webcomics now . Would be more if < PROPMALE > Clem would start writing comics again . =[ 
I had an awesome weekend . ^_^ 
Today , I walked out to the public safety building to get my parking tag . When I came back to my car , I had a $50 parking ticket for not having the tag . Crap . 
Found some leftover pasta in the fridge this morning that I forgot about . My reaction : Oh hi breakfast ! \ 
( So don't say I'm not eating anything . =P ) 
I have a lot on my plate right now . I honestly don't know if I can pull all this off ... 
I love that at < PROPFEMALE>'s funeral in Hamlet , the priest tells her brother Laertes that she shouldn't be getting a proper burial . Then Laertes tells the priest he's going to hell . Awesome . :) 
I just plugged my ipod into my computer to sync some new songs to it . It froze . Now I have to go to work without music . :( 
Zoroastrianism is relavent to my interests . Too bad it only took up 2 paragraphs in my history textbook and will never be mentioned again . 
Dear fellow dorm residents , \ 
I'm sorry my cooking made a loud noise ring in your ear which caused you to evacuate the building . I promise not to use the oven again until tomorrow . \ 
Love , \ 
< PROPFEMALE > 
Shiver me timbers ! It be International Talk Like A Pirate Day ! 
I've been dating < PROPFIRST > Donald-Davis for six months today . Best six months of my life . <3 I love you , baby . 
Awesome occurance : I decided to drop my ANTH class , but I still had the cheaper book since it seemed silly to try to sell a $12 book . Someone just emailed the class ( I'm still on the moodle apparently ) asking to borrow that same book , so I told her I'd sell it for the purchase price . She only had a 20 . Day made . ^_^ 
< PROPMALE > essay : Written\ 
Astronomy article review : ..... crap . \ 
Work : 1 hour . \ 
Me : Meh . =[ 
I really want to start writing again . I haven't in a while ... 
750words.com has my approval . First day and I've written something that could be decent if I messed with it . Will continue using . 
Highlights of my day : All the parts with < PROPFIRST > Donald-Davis in them . Thanks for cheering me up , love . <3 
I'm bored at work . meh . 
\I want to tell you that everything will be okay \ 
You know what ? I think it's gonna be a good week . :) 
I'm starting to think more about my educational future recently . I'm gonna have to talk to an advisor to straighten this mess out . 
New tactic : If I finish my French homework , I get to watch cartoons in < PROPMALE > . I think this is a fair trade . 
< PROPFEMALE > Ronquillo ( 10:59:31 PM ): Well we need to get a TARDIS cookie jar , that's why . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > Abney ( 11:00:01 PM ): Is it bigger on the inside ? \ 
< PROPFEMALE > Ronquillo ( 11:01:01 PM ): Unfortunately no . =( But imagine all the oreos it could hold if it was ! \ 
\ 
Want . 
Gonna have to write two essays to go abroad where I want to . I'd start them now if I could . * bounce * Hurry up and get here , November ! 
\You've got green ocean eyes\ 
Taking a French elective next semester . Should I have my normal French class on MWF an hour before < PROPMALE > or TTH right after my other French class ? Confusion or French overload ? Damn . =/ 
I know what I'm getting < PROPFIRST > Donald-Davis for Christmas . That being said , I can't wait till Christmas . :D Hehe . 
Anybody know where to go in BR to fix a laptop ? I'm pretty sure mine has a virus but it's a tricky bugger . My virus scanners can't find it . 
Hello trainers . Look at your Dex , now back to me , now back at ? your Dex , now back to me . Sadly your Dex isn't mine , but if you stopped using Pokéballs and switched over to Masterballs , you could catch like me . 
I find it weird when friends of friends want to friend me on facebook . I also find it funny how many times I could say friend in one sentence . Friend friend friend ! [/just thought of Ludo from the Labyrinth ] 
The first army ever to defeat the Spartans in an open field of battle was a Theban army of 300 people , allegedly 150 pairs of homosexual lovers , so that they would fight more valiantly in order to avoid being ashamed in front of a lover . It must've worked , since before this , the Spartans were basically undefeated ( They spent their whole lives training for this ! ) . So my question is this : Don't ask , don't tell ? Really ? 
Brittnie Keck ' s ukulele smells like playdough . Why ?! 
I'd vote but A ) I haven't paid enough attention to politics to form a valid opinion , and B ) My voting district is 4.5 hours away ... I still feel bad though . 
I'm really excited that I decided to try doing nanowrimo . It's going to be hard , and I might not finish in a month , but I'm already kind of proud of the product thusfar ( or at least the concepts and plans I've already got working ) . 
I love when I'm writing , and the story just unfolds for me . <3 
XKCD is awesome today . Just so ya know . You should check it out . :) xkcd.com 
Bach ! Activate the magic flute and teleport us home ! Wagner's right behind me on his ring cycle ! 
Happy birthday , Doctor Who ! 47 years , wow ! <3 Well deserved . 
Today's the < PROPFEMALE>'s Day Parade . The night of the living dead is on its way . <3 
Who has the dorkiest little brother ever ? I DO ! ( < PROPMALE > Abney :) ) 
Anyone know a place where I could get a print made in Baton Rouge ? Like , painting size ... not an 8x12 or in that little range ... I don't know where I'd go . 
It's officially the first day of December . That means Christmas is coming ! :D I feel more like a six-year-old about Christmas this year than I have in a long time ... Anyone for a Christmas movie-fest ? 
Fun history fact : When the knights arrived in Jerusalem during the first Crusade , their first method of attack was prayer - they tried to recreate the story of Jericho by praying at the wall . When that didn't work , they did it the old fashioned way and slaughtered people with temporal weapons instead . Lovely , right ? 
Damn ! Did anyone else know fee bills were due tomorrow ? 
I'm nervous because I still haven't received some information I really need from the school about what classes I can take in Germersheim ... I am going to cry if this keeps me from applying since I've sent several emails and made a call about it , and it's not my fault if I can't get it ... augh ... 
I got an 89.5 in theatre . . 5 from an A . dgyjdfghu what the hell ? 
Airport waiting time ... sigh . 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas , all . :) I'm posting some pics in a while . 
The picture uploading thing didn't work . Will have to try again with better internet .... 
Oh jeeze ... I've gotten into Sherlock . MORE NOW PLEASE . 
Finally figured it out . Back in the dorm on the 13th . I'm really tired of living out of a suitcase ..... 
Went up to the checkout with a box of tampons , midol , and chocolate . The cashier asked me something along the lines of how's it going , how am I doing , whatever . I wanted to just say , \Really ? What do you think ? \"" 
Apparently I picked the most difficult school to apply for . Basically , nobody goes there , so no information is on the internet or the LSU files . Plus side : It's easier to get into because not many other people apply . 
I'm pumped for the school year . Having stuff to do , making money , learning things , gonna see < PROPFEMALE > Milliner and < PROPMALE > Harl again ... Good times ! 
I was at Smoothie < PROPMALE > before < PROPFEMALE > on a Sunday . Not fun ... -_- 
Just finished V for Vendetta . It was good , but I think proper books are way better for me than graphic novels . I only want to read the text , and the pictures don't matter so much ... I'm reading an article that comes at the end now , and it's so much easier , not having to concentrate on both words and pictures . Oh well . Good book anyway . I just think I'll stick to text novels now ... 
FREN 2154 is gonna be hard ..... mehhh ... =[ 
I've never paid attention to politics . Now I need to know French politics for oral communication and < PROPMALE > politics to look good in a study abroad interview , which means I should pretty much pay attention to American politics too ... so damn . 
< PROPMALE > Shepherd replied to me on twitter . ^_^ Cool . 
Just watch the State of the Union address . I agreed with a lot of it , but DAMN that is also a lot of optomism . Though I guess that's kind of his job , to rally the American people . A bit different to do that without optomism . 
I wonder if I'll have enough school time to add a linguistics minor ? Probably not . That's an extra 18 hours , and I'll already need extra time for my degree if I can get it here at all . Would be awesome though . 
Things accomplished today : Set up a savings account , got direct deposit with LSU , and applied for a student credit card . I am on fire ( financially) ! 
This assignment is due tomorrow , and I know what I need to say , but I can't collect my thoughts enough to figure out how . -_- D'oh . 
Trying to do homework . Failing miserably . I wanna watch Doctor Who ... 
To anyone who doesn't know , < PROPFIRST > Donald-Davis and I are perfect for each other . Because this conversation is stupid , and anyone else would probably have slapped themselves silly with facepalms from it . Why am I still amehused ? 
Rapeseed : The stuff they make canola oil from . Seriously ... cooking will never be the same . 
Coolest reachable technology ever : Plastic photovoltaic cells . They're cheap , light , and flexible . Which means that one day , with a little further research , they can be woven into your clothes . We could wear t-shirts that charge our cell phones and iPods as we walk through the sun . Please let this actually happen . 
I spent $83 on books today . I have no regrets . 
Just ... fuck this week . I'm so tired . :( 
I don't know if I told you all , but I have an amazing boyfriend . I had a really rough day today and < PROPFIRST > Donald-Davis drove over to pick me up from work so I wouldn't have to walk 10 minutes in the rain . <3 I love him . 
I'm terribly sorry ! I didn't know I was squeezing your eyeball ! 
My study abroad scholarship application is submitted . * deep breaths * 
I'm going to miss having an electric kettle after I don't live with < PROPFEMALE > Milliner anymore ... oh and < PROPFEMALE > too . I'll miss her obviously . 
< PROPMALE > Club today made me really appreciate the way my life is right now . Everything Dr. Leder said made me feel so much more devoted to experiencing life in foreign countries , and knowing how likely that is to happen just makes me feel as if I'm doing something really right . 
Bon Mardi Gras , tout < PROPFEMALE > monde . :) 
66 Days until I never have to work at Smoothie < PROPMALE > again . I get more sick of my job every time they send a schedule out ... 
\I am happy to inform you that you have been selected as an exchange student for the 2011-12 academic year . \ " \ 
I just spent 9 hours recording 16 minutes of French dialogue for my midterm . That was consistently too . I didn't take big breaks . 9 hours . If I don't get an A , I might explode . 
I'm gonna get paid to tutor a girl in < PROPMALE > . Helllllll yes . 
I wish my job was just to be a student . I'd get so much more out of it if I didn't have to spend time working . 
As of yesterday , I've been with < PROPFIRST > Donald-Davis for a whole year . <3 Which is pretty awesome . 
At the Devo show . We we we so excited . 
Devo is so great live . Even without considering their age ... they played all my favorite songs and just managed to rock out 5 times harder than their much younger opener . Would see again ! 
< PROPFIRST > was awesome . Devo was awesome . Hopefully , < PROPFIRST > and His Kind will be awesome ? It had better be . < PROPMALE > Smith , homosexuality , and WWII Berlin ... pretty winning formula . 
My oral : too long and a bit halting . BUT I went first so I get a break on it . M Brager thinks I should write an article about French punk music . :D That part's pretty awesome . 
30 Day Song Challenge Day 2 : Your Least Favourite Song . Sampling gets on my nerves ... it just ruins otherwise good songs . I don't know song titles or anything because I don't LISTEN to this music , but rest assured , it sucks listening to pop radio at work . -_- 
Wow ! Thanks for the birthday wishes , everyone ! It turned out really awesome . <3
