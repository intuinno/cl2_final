Nothing like nearly dying on the way to work . 
???? Baby all I want for Christmas is you ???? 
Bring me Friday night again because this woman drives me insane .

hates < PROPFEMALE > Day and < PROPFEMALE > Haffer . Just saying . 
Worst day ever has gotten a little better with sleep , Roadhouse , Back to the Future trilogy , and a run to town with my best friend < PROPFEMALE > Haffer for dinner . :) 
loves hanging out with my dad ( < PROPMALE > Gamble ) especially when he laughs at my love life . lol <3 :) 
That you can lose yourself . Everything . All boundaries . All time . That 2 bodies can become so mixed up that you don't know who's who or what's what . And just when the sweet confusion is so intense you think you're gonna die . You kinda do . Leaving you alone in your separate body , but the one you love is still there . That's a miracle . You can go to heaven and come back alive . You can go back anytime you want with the 1 you love . 
Isn't that what love is supposed to feel like though ? Perfection when you're together and absolute hell when you're apart ? <3 
\I'm not someone who likes to get involved past a certain point ... and that point ... was about a week ago . \ " \

Cousins are the first friends of your life , No one will ever understand your crazy family like your cousins ; even if you're not in regular contact . Repost if you have the BEST cousins in the world .? 
is watching the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time on VH1 and realizing that I love a lot of the greatest artists . Does that make me the greatest fan ? Possibly . :) <3 
is having one of those moments after all these 80s rock songs that she would give almost anything for another dinner at Pizza Inn with Dad or another MarioKart match or another night of watching wrestling and listening to him get all excited and say \Did you just see that ?! Did you just ? What ?! What ?! \ " It's scary that I see him when I look in the mirror . I miss you Daddy . <3 " 
Whatever you do\ 
I'll be two steps behind you \ 
Wherever you go\ 
and I'll be there to remind you \ 
that it only takes a minute of your precious time \ 
to turn around . \ 
I'll be two steps behind . \

Once the realization is accepted that even between the closest human beings infinite distances continue , a wonderful living side by side can grow , if they succeed in loving the distance between them which makes it possible for each to see the other whole against the sky . \

Dear < PROPFEMALE > , the Teenage Witch , \ 
I do not need to wake up and experience you running from the musician/manager < PROPFIRST > . I do not need to listen to your fear of commitment because you're afraid of getting hurt again , and I am positive that I don't want to see ya'll kiss at the end of the episode . \
