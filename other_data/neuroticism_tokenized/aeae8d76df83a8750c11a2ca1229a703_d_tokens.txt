is shivering with anticipation . 

has writer's block , guess you can't be inspired all the time . 
is super ecstatic ! 
hates the after effects of immunization . 
is excited for Saturday ! 
is having a heated debate with the voices in his head . 
feels like this has been a short weekend . 
is tired , and has to work all day tomorrow . 
I think I'll try defying gravity tomorrow . 
Has had a full weekend and is ready to retire . 
Thoughts racing , go away . If only the loud roar of decisions could be calmed , I might have a < PROPMALE > at the the future . 
is enjoying his last night before the homework must be done . Darn the homework ! 
I spent all day today at the Galleria in < PROPFIRST > , that is one huge mall . XD 
is ready for things to change , goodbye 2009 and hello 2010 . 
is so excited to celebrate 2011 with my favorite person , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Dowd tonight :) 
< PROPMALE > Jones is amazing !!!!!!!!!! I love him so :) 
is super excited for North Night Live ! It's going to be epic . 
Oh , I totally colored my hair . 
I am so bored right now . But then again , maybe bored isn't so bad , when you really think about it . 
Time to sleep , it's been an all too eventful day ... 
\Sunday morning rain is falling ... \"" 
Ever have one of those truly dark days , where all you can think about are dead poets and lullabies , and suffocating ? 
Being sick sucks , especially on the weekend . :( 
Confessions ... sometimes there's just no other way . You trust those you love , and pray that they will still love you when the storm comes . 
It seems facebook told people to write on my wall , this is a sign that facebook loves me . :) Thank you all , love you guys . 
No , this isn't what it looks like at all , because if it was , it would be me standing over a dead body in a suspicious manner ... which it's not ! 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Dowd is amazing ! :) 
Awesome ! I finally finished moving in and unpacking , and I hurt all over . And thanks to < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > , I have internet again . Life is good . 
If I haven't texted you back by now , there's a reason , so stop texting me ! Okay love you , bye ;) 
How on Earth was I blessed to have such talented friends ... you know who you are . 
There is a war being raged in my tummy , and I'm getting mixed signals . 
Too many questions , and I don't know the answer to any of them . I've never felt this ... frozen . Maybe if I stand still enough , all these questions will pass on by , and I won't need to confront them . 
Awesome day thanks to < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Koepf . You're so amazing ! :) 
On days like these , people and places just fade into one gray fog , and everything blurs together . All I can think about are my thoughts , and somehow I just feel so ... limited . When do I get to make the rules for once ? 
Best day of my life ever ! Thank you God for all these things you've done for me , I feel free for the first time in a long time . I looked in the mirror tonight , and liked the person looking back at me ... God works miracles . 
Exam on Tuesday , have to study harder . \ 
Mood = apathy 
I have the greatest friends in the world , you guys ( and girls ) are so spectacular ! 
Well , this is quite the situation isn't it ? I guess life has its way of messing with your head , and all of the sudden , the crossroads become more numerous . But this time , I have a compass , I know where I'm going , and I'll get there in one piece . 
I'd say today has been an altogether great day . And Glee was on , which made my week ! 
I swear , if I didn't have to sleep I would sing straight through the night , because music = my passion . Can't wait for next semester ! :) 
< PROPMALE > , I don't want to stare at that disgusting arm wound ! EWW !!! 
I don't like you < PROPFIRST > 
get off of me 
< PROPFIRST > is a lactoseterrorist 
Everything feels at peace at 4:00 am , I wish I was nocturnal , so I could enjoy the solemnity and calm every day . But alas , I am not , to bed I go . Goodnight . ^.^ 
tick tick boom ... tiresome business :/ 
I'm feeling really fat and sassy ! < PROPFIRST > Franco is so cool and so much better then me at everything ! Except maybe being fat and sassy ... but anwho : < PROPFIRST > Franco is freaking amazing and I hope that one day when I am living on the streets and he is a hotshot Broadway director , he will feed me some scraps or something . \ 
\ 
Ps . < PROPFIRST > Franco is my bff whom I would give my kidney to . :) 
Though I do love < PROPFIRST > Franco , and might give him my kidney if we were the same blood type , I am so better than him at everything ! I should not have left my computer alone with you :P \ 
p.s. That cardigan you were wearing today , would have looked much better on me ;P \ 
Still my bff though ^_^ 
Goodnight world . 
Planning is tiring :/ 
This year is off to a great start , I am so very excited for what God is doing ! 
OUCH ! It hurts , and I feel like Frankenstein right now , just great :{

I love love love < PROPFEMALE > Schulien and < PROPMALE > Slade !!! Thank you both for an awesome day . 
Someone , somewhere , must be willing to hire me . I need a job so very badly . :/ 
Dentist office ... I hate the smell . 
I'm so excited for Thrive tonight ! 
I have traversed the great snowy streets , all to reach the holy place ... IHOP ! So totally worth it .
