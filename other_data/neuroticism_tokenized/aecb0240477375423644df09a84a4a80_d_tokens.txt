Powwow was a success !!! collected a ton of food this year ... every tribe got sent home with at least 3 boxes packed of food for their families who are in need ... tons of coats , blankets and bedding were donated to pine ridge reservation .. even though it was donation at the door we collected a few hundred dollars there ... at least a hundred during the potlatch dance ...

Dear Mother Nature , \ 
Although I appreciate your attempts at making me feel less homesick by honoring us last week with 18in of snow , I do believe the 5-10\ scheduled to fall today is getting to be a bit much . I'd like you to consider that I have to travel for class and that many professors couldn't give a shit . "
