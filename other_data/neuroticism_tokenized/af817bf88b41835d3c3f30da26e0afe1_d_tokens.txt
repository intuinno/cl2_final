I'll finally be starting a new second job . Back at the Home Depot again of all places ! This is a big step in the right direction , and I can't wait to get started . If things go well I'll be looking at houses again by the end of the year ! 

Hey all , just finished a gem of a game today . For you DS owners out there , < PROPFIRST > and Luigi : Bowsers ' Inside Story is a must have ! 
Its steadily warming up ever slowly . I don't mind the rain , because it gets rid of the snow . I'm just dieing to get back on the golf course . Ah , two beautiful things about spring , Cubs baseball and Golf . For the time being though March Madness will have to fill the gap , oh well . 
Just got back from the driving range for the second time this season . The switch to lefty clubs is definitely an adjustment , but I can see it improving already . This season holds some promise yet . The first game on the course still awaits . That will be the real test . 
The weather has been outstanding these past few days . Im grateful I have been able to take advantage in most cases . Summer and fall are just around the corner 
Just finished a detail and taking in a cubs game . Nice balanced indoor/outdoor mix for the day . Hope everyone else is enjoying their Sunday 
The Empire Carpet guy is dead ! Talk about the death of local icon . Oh well the jingle will live on stuck in our heads , wanted or otherwise
