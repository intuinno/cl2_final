Everyone loves hazardous material ! :D 

I forgot I made a facebook a looong time ago . :) 
Maybe I should add a picture ... 
I love < PROPMALE > like whoa . >:3 
Curse Kidz Bop !! 
Head for the hills , the kitchen's on fire ! 
Poor little < PROPFEMALE > has pink-eye . Her eyes are all swollen and she looks like she's constantly crying . 
Now , who could hold a grudge on a lovely day like this ? :) 
Chocolate chip eggo waffles ? Yes !! :D 
I want to write , but I have no ideas . :( 
Old people ! Old people everywhere ! And by old people , I mean old PERSON . And by old PERSON , I mean < PROPMALE > Fryhover . He's older than me . His birthday lies . 
People come up with the dumbest usernames on Myspace . \d ! z ch ! k bad\ " ? Really ? * facepalm * " 
Mockingjay -- August 24 <3333 
If you find yourself here on my side of town , I'd pray that you'd come to my door . 
My day was boring , then it was good . And now I feel sick to my stomach for something small that I never should have said . 
Just put me in a box and bury me in the sand . 
Your embrace is my air ; how I needed you there . And all of the world and all of its powers couldn't keep your love from me , no . 
Pre-ordered Mockingjay and bought another book that I'm hoping I'll thoroughly enjoy . :) 
Staying out until 5 am probably wasn't the best idea , but it was sure a fun night ! 
You deleted me from your friends ? Wow , I'm just so hurt right now . XD 
Sometimes , I can't help but gag at things that were once said to me that are now said to someone else . Why did I ever like that ? XD 
Finally deleted my Myspace . 
I need to go buy my books for CAC today . :/ 
I was all happy and excited , and then it went away in a split second . No time , no time , no time . It doesn't matter . Once school starts , I won't have time either . 
Do this ! Like my status and I'll write you a letter ! Dear ____ , you have a cute ____ . You make me ____ . You should be ____ . You and me should ____ . I'd get your name tattooed on my ____ . You are so ____ ! 
Time to man up , you over-grown child . :) 
</3 
Team < PROPFIRST > eta -- because < PROPFIRST > and Peeta combined would make one excellent man . :) 
So the dog is back , but I still have yet to find a way for < PROPFIRST > Barrow to not move to Chandler . 
< PROPFIRST > Barrow's not moving ! So happy . :) 
Sylar ! </3 
Oh goodness , dreams really do come true ! :3 
CONCERT , ANYONE ? My brothers ' band is playing with some really good bands , including < PROPMALE > , Dangerous Summer , The Higher , and Quietdrive ! \ 
At the Nile Theater in Mesa on Monday , September 6 ( Labor Day ) at 5:30 . Tickets are $12 , or $15 at the door . I have 7 tickets to sell , or you can buy them from < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . I have 5 seats in my car for rides . :) \ 
Please come , it should be AWESOME ! Text for details . 
Two separate thoughts :\ 
1 ) I find myself losing respect for people more and more every day . \ 
2 ) I hope you know I'd give them all up for you . 
You're all that's ever on my mind . 
Bummed out . :( No concert for < PROPFEMALE > tonight . 
I love you more than I have ever found a way to say to you . 
I love < PROPFIRST > Hernandez because he brought me cookies . :3 
Oh park , what fun have you in store for < PROPMALE > Fearn and I tonight ? 
My Zune is officially screwed . I either send it in and pay $160 for a cheap , refurbished one or buy a brand new one . >:/ 
I miss my boys . :( You know who you are ! 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , balancing my checkbook does NOT make me dorky . :) Thank you very much ! 
It just got all outrageous up in here ! :D 
I think it's honest enough to say that today was a pretty good day . :) 
Wow , you really didn't deserve her . 
You know what's worse than getting replaced ? Getting replaced by someone 50 times uglier and 100 times less cool than you . 
I hate when people make stupid accusations , like they think they know me . 
Surprisingly , I'm super bummed out that I missed the homecoming game . 
You know you watch too much Criminal Minds when you have a dream about < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > telling you about a girl committing suicide . 
I love that people think I really care what they say . Aha , get your facts straight . 
< PROPMALE > Jobs , stop smiling you imbecile ! 
Can't decide what laptop I want . :/ 
If you would DATE me like this status , if you LOVE me put a ?, if you're my FRIEND put a (: , if you HATE me put an :( , if you MISS me put a :/ , if you're UPSET with me put a :P face . Then copy this in your status & see how people feel about you . 
Went on a \mini\ " date with a super cute guy from work . :) " 
When I catch that bug that keeps flying around , I will annihilate it . >:| 
Hurting for your losses won't fix anything , but at least you know it'll help you come out stronger . 
It smells like someone's been eating chili dogs in my car . :/ 
\To be great is to be misunderstood . \"-- Ralph < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > " 
< PROPMALE > Fearn : You don't need a warning . You should always be prepared for < PROPFEMALE > . 
This essay is killer . >:( 
Deciding on laptops is wretched business . 
Ahh , I love spontaneity . :) 
And the finalists are : < PROPFEMALE > Inspiron 15R and Acer Aspire 5742 ! \ 
Both have the specs I'm looking for . Oh , decisions decisions . \ 
Which do you think ? 
So I'm driving home from work behind this guy that's going 40 in a 50mph zone . Of course , I pass him , and what does he do ? He turns on his brights ! What a jerk . D:< 
My mom opens the door and what does he do ? He bolts ! Typical male ... 
I wish I knew how to fix this ... 
So I got stuck in traffic behind a dog . It's trotting in the middle of the road , so I honk at it and all it does is glance back at me ! Stupid dog . 
Between picking a hair color and picking a computer , I've got a lot of decisions to make ! 
Laura : You wanna dye your hair ? \\nMe : Mind your own beeswax ! \\nLaura : I don't want to look at something ugly every day . \\nMe : You wake up and look in the mirror ! 
I found my computer . :D 
I really want to write , but my mental block has yet to lift . :/ 
Supposedly , my laptop has shipped ! :3 
Apparently my Halloween makeup would look good tattooed on my face . :p 
So glad October's over ! Welcome , November ! 
Punk Goes Pop 3 ? Oh yes ! :D 
What's black and blue and lying in a ditch ? A man who told too many blonde jokes . XD 
Hm , how unfortunate we didn't take the Senate . But at least we have the House ! :D 
I'm lovin ' the punk covers of \Bad Romance\ " and \ " Right Now ( Na Na Na)\ " . <33 " 
Edward : Mmm , you smell tasty ! Wanna date ? Bella : Finally ! 
Matthew : You have to have a Naval commander to do that . Wilson : Ha ! A bellybutton commander ! 
< PROPFEMALE>'s eyes say it's time for a nap , but her mind says otherwise . :| 
Didn't realize I had to wake my sister this morning , slept through the alarm , and got yelled at by a frantic , bawling ten-year-old who believed she would run late for school ( which she didn't ) . What a morning ! Aha . 
Hating this weather . :( 
You know what I make better than kids ? ... Spaghetti . 
Sigh . 
< PROPMALE > Alvarez Cortés : You're good at forgetting things , so forget it . \ 
Me : XD 
With the exception of that horrible movie , last night was the best night EVAAAR ! Just like every night . :) 
Fun is my Chinese neighbor's middle name ! 
I'm so sick of hearing my dad rant about how stupid Disney channel's gotten . I already know , so I don't need to hear about it . 
I really hate when someone asks me to read their story and it's some lame-o fanfic about < PROPFIRST > Bieber . 
That jacket makes you look like a marshmallow ... I would roast you over a fire . ;) 
HONESTLY :\ 
If you think I'm cute , like my status . If you love me , put a heart ?. If I am a good friend , put a :) . If you miss me , put a :/ . If you ever had a crush on me , put a XD . If you're brave , put this as your status . 
Learning to drive stick shift is so frustrating , but luckily < PROPMALE > Alvarez Cortés is a most patient and excellent teacher . :) 
Rappers sure do love women . I mean , they talk about them like they're objects , and then they call them liars and say they complain too much . I feel the love ... 
Looking for a new Christmas present for my special someone . :) I hope he doesn't guess it this time ... 
Bummed out and a little hurt . :/ 
Sooo excited for Thanksgiving tomorrow . :3 
I miss Photoshop so much ! * cries into hands * 
I love my dinosaur , but his nervous leg makes me anxious . 
< PROPFEMALE > needs to leave , but has no place to go and not enough money to support herself . 
Woke up with a leg cramp . I thought it was just a dream ! 
< PROPMALE > Alvarez Cortés : Hey , look ! Our phones are banging ! \ 
Romaneraptors are super pro at backing up and their diet consists of < PROPFEMALE > and coke . 
Note to self : Do not read < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > Poe at night anymore . 
\ ... one could pretend that the speaker was really Poe himself and < PROPFEMALE > stood as his beloved Vagina -- I mean Virginia ! \ " * facepalm * Gotta love < PROPMALE > Alvarez Cortés and his bad reading . ;) " 
#159 Giiirl , I don't know where to begin ! We've been through a lot of stuff together and you've always stayed by my side . I know if I ever need help , you'll be there for me . We're so different , but we still understand each other and that's what makes us so great ! I love you and you don't ever change . <3 
#1 We just barely met , but I really enjoy talking to you ! You're super nice and we always seem to find things to talk about . :) I hope we get to know each other better . 
#8 Ah , you're hilarious ! You always have stories to tell and I love to hear them ! 
#104 I miss you ! You're still one of my best friends and it really upsets me when things aren't going well for you . You know I'll always be there if you need anything ( emotional support , etc . ) , so don't be afraid to ask me for help ! Oh , and we still need to < PROPFEMALE > out ! 
#22 ² ( or 484 ) Despite occasionally being a < PROPMALE > bit creepy , you are freakin ' awesome ! I know most of the time I'm afraid for my life when I'm around you , whether it be when you're driving or when you're holding a pillow to my face , but I still love you . :) And I can't believe it took me so long to realize that you look like the caterpillar from < PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland ! 
#1122 You make me laugh so hard ! I consider you one of my best friends and I hope we still talk when we're all married and moved away . I think you're a good person and a great friend ! And I'll get your dress back to you eventually . :) 
#111 Man , we've known each other forever ! I remember when we first met , all the way back in second grade ! And we used to play basketball together . :) I'm really glad we got to become better friends during senior year because I'd forgotten how awesome you are ! Keep it real , homeboy . :p 
#64 Oh man ! I remember you always sat next to < PROPMALE > in seminary and you two would always say really funny stuff . :p And I saw you on the corner with < PROPFIRST > that one time ! I miss seminary . :( 
#70 I miss you ! It was so fun to sit in Mrs. Gillespie's storage room and chat instead of doing work like a good < PROPFEMALE > . I'm glad I got to know you , and when you visit , we should < PROPFEMALE > out ! 
#2 I think you're absolutely gorgeous ! And I love your hair . :) Do you remember doing Women at the Well together at girls camp ? You have a really pretty singing voice and we should do a duet together sometime ! 
#21 Oh my , what to say about you . So many things ... You're the best boyfriend a girl could ask for . You always make sure to let me know that you care , whether it's by bringing me breakfast at CAC or by telling me you love me . I think you're one of the sweetest people on the planet , and I can't even begin to explain how much I appreciate the way you treat and respect me . 
#400 Gahh , I miss you a lot ! I keep wanting to text you but every time I think about it , it's at a time where I'm too busy to text anyone . I think you're freakin ' amazing ( but you already knew that ) . I love how honest and straight forward you are . You just keep being you . :) Love yooou ! <3 
#005 I had so much fun getting to know you this semester ! I also liked talking about Ms. < PROPMALE>'s out-of-line comments directed toward us white folk ( HAHA ) . I'll see you next semester !! Oh , almost forgot to tell you that you and < PROPFIRST > make a great couple . :) 
Confess something you never told me before in my inbox ; it'll stay just between us . Put this as your status you might be surprised ! :) 
< PROPMALE > Alvarez Cortés : What did he say ?! \

I thought family was supposed to make you feel like you're worth something , not make you feel less . 
Watching the sunrise on the way to work . What a beautiful morning ! 
I feel like I went to a taxidermist , ' cause I'm stuffed ! 
I'm tired of all the MCR/Green Day/Avenged Sevenfold crap on Mibba . :( 
You should get a man like mine . He's a multi-man . He's a trash collector , a souvenir , and an exotic male model . I should put him up for sale on Craigslist . 
So , I roll down my window , and < PROPMALE > Alvarez Cortés approaches and the first thing he says to me is , \Tonight's half price ! \ " XD " 
Had an awesome dream about Tron . And then I threw up . >:( 
* obnoxious sound*\ 
Me : < PROPFEMALE > , I have a question ... \ 
< PROPFEMALE > : What ? \ 
Me : DO YOU WANNA DIE ?! 
Wonderful Christmas season . :) 
Finally got the Book of Mormon , Doctrine and Covenants , < PROPFEMALE > of Great Price , and the Old and New Testaments loaded onto my Nook . :) 
< PROPMALE > Alvarez Cortés bought me a new birthday dress . :) Best boyfriend ever ? 
Thank you to everyone who wished me a happy birthday and/or came to my surprise party ! <3 
I'm really hating the Adobe company right now . -.- 
The wii's given me massive arm aches , but my muscle is HUGE ( ish ) . 
Going in for a long shift today . 
< PROPMALE > wants to be a bellydancer . 
\Cleopatra's Daughter\ " was a most interesting book . :) " 
Sooo , I've decided that < PROPFEMALE > Minaj sounds extremely spastic in \Bottoms Up\ " . Her part is just ... a nuisance . " 
Loves < PROPMALE > Alvarez Cortés . <3 
< PROPMALE > Alvarez Cortés : < PROPFEMALE > , you wanna do me a favor ? \ 
< PROPFEMALE > : * silence*\ 
< PROPMALE > : You wanna run to the Grand Canyon and jump off ? \ 
< PROPFEMALE > cold ! 
119 ?? Impossible ! 
< PROPMALE > Alvarez Cortés <3<3<3 
Me : It's fun , F-U-H-N . \ 
< PROPMALE > Alvarez Cortés : Hey , \fun\ " doesn't have an H in it ! \ 
I just found out that the amount of credits I've gotten makes me sophomore status at CAC . Not that it makes much of a difference , but I did wonder what I was considered . :) 
< PROPFEMALE > : * takes picture of herself * I look stupid . \ 
Me : < PROPFEMALE > , the only time you don't look stupid is when I'm standing next to you . XD 
The government looks at third graders ' reading levels to determine how many beds to put in prisons within the next 10 to 15 years . Insanity ?! D: Learned that in my Child Development class . 
Sitting in Creative Writing , waiting for class to be over ! 
Fake ? Ha , okay . 
I love those people that pick fights on Formspring because they can be anonymous . It makes me feel good to know that there are people 500 times more pathetic than I could EVER be . :) 
< PROPMALE>'s talk was great . :) I'm so proud ! 
< PROPMALE > says , \Ten go pick a song in my cool low . \ " XD " 
estoy enamorada de mi fiance ! 
Sick and lip's still swollen . No work for < PROPFEMALE > today . :( 
Gosh , if you're going to insult me , at least spell the insult correctly . 
Oh < PROPMALE > Alvarez Cortés , my life could never be the same without you . <3 
< PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Lamoreaux are finally engaged !!! 
The reception last night just made me that much more excited for my wedding . (: 
Less than five months until I marry < PROPMALE > Alvarez Cortés ! <3 
Who needs < PROPFIRST>'s Day ? Every day is special with < PROPMALE > Alvarez Cortés . (: 
Me : I want to take pictures ! (: \ 
< PROPMALE > Alvarez Cortés : But the Lord has commanded that I look ugly today . ): \ 
Nothing says \I love everyone\ " like hiding people's posts from my feed . (: " 
Me : Did you go to clubs ? \ 
< PROPMALE > Alvarez Cortés : No . \ 
Me : The club couldn't handle you anyway . \ 
< PROPMALE > : That's why I didn't go ! \ 
I miss < PROPMALE > Alvarez Cortés ! Can't wait to see him at work tomorrow ! <3 
I don't think I believe in best friends . They change all the time and you eventually end up looking for a new one . 
< PROPMALE > Alvarez Cortés : You should give me a massage . \ 
Me : Nah , my hands are too tired from grabbing your boobs . \ 
< PROPMALE > : XD 
Me : Do you know the muffin man ? \ 
< PROPMALE > Alvarez Cortés : No , should I ? \ 
Me : Only if you want a muffin . \ 
< PROPMALE > : ... Huh ? 
When you're stuck writing a creative nonfiction story , painful memories sure do come in handy . 
I can't sleep , ' cause all I can do is think about you . (: < PROPMALE > Alvarez Cortés 
You know I need you just like you need me . Can't stop , won't stop . I must be dreaming . <3 \ 
Forgot how much I love The Maine ! 
I'm just waiting for the episode when one of the Jersey Shore cast finds out they have an STD . 
I really hate hypocrites . 
I love my sweetie pie . (: < PROPMALE > Alvarez Cortés 
Packing my stuff . (: What tedious but exciting work ! 
I could run like a coward for the door , but I'd never get out . 
Finally watched < PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland for the second time and I still didn't like it . ): The Red < PROPFEMALE > was , again , the most enjoyable part for me . 
If I were a raindrop , you'd be my thunderstorm . <3 
My stupid creative writing teacher STILL hasn't graded ANY of my stuff . ):< 
I miss my job . )): 
HONESTY !!! \ 
If you love me , comment on this status . \ 
If you think I'm a good friend , like this status . \ 
If you hate me , message me and tell me why . \ 
If you ever had/currently have a crush on me , be honest and message me . \ 
If you're not scared , make this your status . 
Jealousy is such a nasty , bitter thing . 
Why is it that I'm only given two options to everything lately , neither of which is what I would choose for myself . Why can't I choose the third option I see ? Clearly , I'm not able to make my own decisions , so I need someone to tell me what I should do . Why don't I just buy myself a high chair and wait for someone to spoon feed me ? 
Oh , hiccups . Please go away !
