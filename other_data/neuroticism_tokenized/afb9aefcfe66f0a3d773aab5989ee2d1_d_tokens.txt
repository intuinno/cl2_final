A fantastic Monday afternoon and evening with Beka Flanagan coming up , causing trouble and other shenanigans . 
Finishing up some boxes . Wondering where all this stuff came from . 
Barrington High School has yet another suicide . Four students took their lives in the last two years . When I was in high school , suicide was NEVER talked about and there were no resources available . So I am glad that something is being done . I am really starting to realize that I was one of the lucky ones . WHEN IS THE COMMUNITY AND THE HIGH SCHOOL GOING TO REALIZE THAT SOMETHING MORE AND DIFFERENT NEEDS TO BE DONE ?! 
I love having a single room and I just moved in a few hours ago ! 
\I crossed the street to walk in the sunshine \"- < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > " 
630 am sunrise . Gerber Daisies , Chrysanthemums , and Dahlias growing on the window sill . 
I am saving at least $120 by renting my Statistics book for $60 . And let me tell you , the shape that this book is in- I should be getting it for $30 . It is like a first grade < PROPMALE > class exploded in it , and then gave it to some preschoolers to chew on . 
its not about perfection , its progress . 
There are two great days in a person's life ; the day we are born and the day we discover why . 
I love being at the Public Library during a rainstorm , having plenty of work . I love KCRG interactive weather radar , knowing the rain should pass within the hour . I love the timing as I'll be ready to pickup dinner . I love the fact that I knew it would rain one of these days , so I have my awesome rain jacket with me . I love watching people run and scream . I love how rainy days are the best times for writing poetry . 
Biked 5.32 < PROPMALE > from Burge to the < PROPFEMALE > Ridge Mall ... didn't expect to be biking into the 21 knots/ 24 mph wind ! With my luck I'll be biking into the wind on my way back . 
Labor Day will consist of biking 3 < PROPMALE > at 8AM to Touch the Earth rental center . Heading out for the day to canoe the Maquoketa River ! Getting back into the area around 6PM , and biking back to campus using some awesome bike lights . 
Too much unfocused energy is worse than perceived . 
I absolutely love ( old school ) Linkin Park ! I really\ 
liked ‘Minutes to Midnight’ , though it wasn’t the same LP that I grew up with . After hearing the single \The\ 
THIS IS A MUST SEE !!!!!!!! http://www.tappedthemovie.com/ ----- click\ 
on “The Trailer” . If protecting our water resources from corporate control\ 
interests you- Food & Water Watch is hosting a special screening Wednesday\ 
9/15 , 6:30 PM - 9 PM at the Iowa City Public Library ( Room A ) . Come on out , I’ll\ 
be there too ! 
My lab group’s theme is to make things as complicated as can\ 
be- therefore Sunday afternoon we’re collecting 60 ground < PROPFEMALE > samples , recording\ 
height and leaf length , and walking across campus to weigh 30 samples 
DAY TWO : studying + lots of coffee ( Coheed & Cambria / Bose\ 
noise cancelling headphones ) = ridiculous productivity ? wired for quite some\ 
time = biking without reason at blazing speeds later 
For someone who absolutely loves extreme weather I never considered NYC and tornados ... 
calculated the standard deviation of 120 < PROPFIRST > by hand today . it sucked . 
' Green High Performance Racing Machines ' will be by far the coolest research paper and presentation I have ever prepared ! 
Had an EPIC morning flying session at the park with my 7ft shark kite !!!!!!!! 
Today I unearthed and lopper-ed honeysuckle trees , some 12ft tall with wrist sized roots .... [ manual labor by means of shovel + dirt = bliss ] And then there was the girl that arrived in a taxi ($14 , 1.5 mi drive ) Wearing a low cut ( sweatshirt ? ) , skin tight leggings , and alligator skin rain boots . Carrying a leather bag , and her makeup and hair all done up ... Enough said . 
Being academically responsible and dropping my Orienteering class for this weekend ... :( I have been waiting for this weekend since registration . 
GO CHICAGO BEARS !!! 
I extend my sympathy to the family , friends , and classmates of UT < PROPFIRST>'s < PROPMALE > Tooley who took his life . Our hearts are heavy for you today . 
( Certainly ) one of my favorites .... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okZrssQvLWY 
Weekend Plans : Studying for Field Methods in Physical Geography midterm , \ 
and reading \Scientific Method for Ecological Research\ " . This is going \ 
Suicide Prevention is very important to me . Please take 10 minutes out of your day to watch this : http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=6923266n&tag=contentBody;featuredPost-PE 
Geoscience Grad Student : points to Arkansas , and calls it Kansas . Later points to Minnesota and looks up for verification . There is something very disturbing about this . 
Sunday is 10/10/10 , an international day in which WE DEMAND responsible climate change legislation from world leaders ! Sunday --- PENTACREST 2-pm-4pm ... No pre-registration needed for the 3.5 mi bike ride or a short unity walk . 
This has to be the saddest thing I have ever read . There is absolutely no excuse why it has taken so many lives to be lost , for us to even start addressing bullying seriously . http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20101008/ap_on_re_us/us_bullying_one_town 
\Dear < PROPFEMALE > 
I am submitting some poetry to Earthwords and ....... I am looking for someone trustworthy and interested in reading some of my poetry to help me decide which few to submit . The deadline is this Friday the 15th , so I am a bit late getting on this . But if you can help me out , let me know , I would really appreciate it ! 
The perfect jammin song ! < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ‘you can get it if you really want’ How can you listen to this and not want to dance , grab the closest thing and start drumming , and/or sing along !? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzSzhHmhiOY 
Way to go HAWKEYES ! Now lets go cheer for the CHICAGO BEARS ! 
is finally finding her place in everything ! And people that accept just that . 
Find something PURPLE to wear Wednesday the 20th . This intolerance must end ! 
Just got back from racing two policemen on bicycles !!!! Yes , you read that right , street racing with officers of the law . If anyone should ask , it was just an intense evening workout ! 
today is going to require an endless pot of coffee . plenty of hot chocolate . and such . all running on 5 hrs of sleep . 
Proud to say that my new phone's battery cover is 35% recycled material from water bottles and other polycarbonates , minimal packaging is 60% recycled material , and the soy ink reference guide is 20% recycled paper ! 
You will be missed Prof < PROPFEMALE > . RIP . 
To the People of Iowa City : I want to personally thank whoever tried to steal the rear tire of my bicycle . Furthermore , I want to congratulate this individual for not knowing what the hell they were doing ! 
If you care at all , VOTE Tuesday , November 2 , 2010 . http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vtHwWReGU0&feature=channel 
Goodnight room . Goodnight < PROPFEMALE > . Goodnight cow jumping over the < PROPFEMALE > ... Goodnight clocks and goodnight socks ... Goodnight stars . Goodnight air . Goodnight noises everywhere . 
The consequence of gay marriage : Russia will not invade . Judgment day will not begin . Families will not be destroyed . And the ice caps will not melt ... And gay people will be married . Get over it ! 
To be nobody but yourself in a world which is doing its best , night and day , to make you everybody else means to fight the hardest battle which any human being can fight ; and never stop fighting . ~ e.e. cummings 
At my signal , unleash hell . 
PLASTIC BAGS ARE EVERYWHERE . Is a plastic bag really\ 
needed to walk 20 feet to a table , only to be THROWN AWAY IN THE GARBAGE ? \ 
Latest figures show 6,078 Taco < PROPFEMALE > stores\ 
worldwide . The new store in Mumbai , < PROPFEMALE > serves ~ 2,500 customers each\ 
day that is 2,500 plastic bags !!!! That figure alone is disgusting , never mind\ 
the other 6,077 stores ! 
potential energy . kinetic energy . free fall . velocity . parachute failure . backup parachute failure . next ? 
Electricity , entering at the fingers and exiting at the toes is an unpleasant but very interesting feeling . Coincidentally , I feel recharged . ( Pun partially intended . ) 
In one week , I’ll be test driving the Nissan Juke ! “The story behind that is the stuff of legend . Urban Legend . ” Watch the trilogy at http://www.youtube.com/user/nissancanada ( The Dread . Weather . The Trophy . ) 
I cannot account for how much caffeine was consumed ... but I can account for 17 productive hours of my 20 hour day ( 7:30 am Tues - 3:30 am Wed ) . Off to bed for 4 amazing hours of sleep , to wake up at 7:30 am to finish studying for my Field Methods in Physical Geography exam ... 
Why do you choose to hate people you have never met ? 
HELP ME OUT HERE : how are gay jokes thought to be acceptable , but : black , jewish , polish , handicapped , etc are inappropriate ? Or are gay jokes somehow different ?... If someone says the ' n-word ' and claims it is not racial , does that make it okay ? If someone calls another a ' teabagger ' and claims it is not sexual , does that make it okay ? 
a bed with box-springs , no parties across the hall , one flight of stairs , access to stocked fridge and pantry , a shower with consistent water pressure , real eggs for breakfast , no ridiculous fire alarms , wall mounted plasma tv with surround sound , beautiful cars in the garage ..... what more could i ask for 
Monday Afternoon : test driving the AWD Nissan Juke SL !!!!! 
Thanks for the birthday wishes everyone !!!! It was definitely a day for the books ! 
had a lovely glass of Markham Chardonnay for dinner . 
What we need are more people who specialize in the impossible- < PROPMALE > Roethke 
In all seriousness , there is nothing better than walking out the door at 8am and being greeted with light flurries ! 
After some thinking , I came to the conclusion that I have thought about this for far too long . I am going to get a Master's degree in Architecture , and become a LEED Certified Architect . 
WORDS TO LIVE BY : keep it simple , progress not perfection , you're worth it , one day at a time , easy does it , don't leave before the miracle , this too shall pass , live and let live , keep coming back ... 
I am sick of hearing people talk crap about Obama . In case you forgot :\ 
http://whatthefuckhasobamadonesofar.com/ We had PROBLEMS with < PROPMALE > & Bush , and now we have PROBLEMS with Obama ... Do you notice a pattern ? Every President that comes along , we are going to have PROBLEMS with . By the way , the only thing I see you doing is complaining . This is what Obama has done ... Pardon me , but what the fuck have you done ? 
Just spent 5 hours in the Geography lab cooking soil in an 842F oven ... 
Has anyone ever been to Madagascar or Malaysia ? I have a Summer 2011 opportunity to be a part of a SCUBA Research Expedition ! 
Some fantastic traveling expeditions coming up with the New Year ! 03/1 0-0 3/22 ( Spring Break and a few extra days ) - I will be traveling Eastern < PROPFEMALE > for a class ! 05/22-05/02 in Malaysia for SCUBA < PROPFEMALE > ecosystems research ( not yet 100% family approved but quite promising ) , and 06/2 0-0 7/15 at IA Lakeside Lab , taking a Prairie Ecology course ! 
108 pages later , I know all there is on climate change affects on vegetation cover ... 
Waking up to the sound of a snow plow , what a beautiful thing ! Iowa City has officially been covered by snow !!!! 
Found a < PROPFEMALE > this morning , 1973 ... 12/13/73 , World Football League grants 1st franchise ( Detroit ) Hope this is a good sign . 
Just got done with my Environmental Science exam ! I owe my extensive knowledge about red tides and groundwater to the endless times I have watched the movie ‘Sahara’ . I also had a few “You know , the root of the word ____ is a Greek word , meaning _____ .... Okay , there you go ! ” moments from the movie ‘My Big Fat Greek Wedding” 
Kool & The Gang . Enough said . 
I love it when a plan comes together ! 
I need a miracle . I need the statistics grading curve to save me . 
Congratulations to every member of the Senate who voted to repeal DADT , especially the 8 Republican Senators who broke ranks in the name of doing the right thing : < PROPFIRST > Burr ( NC ) , < PROPFIRST > < PROP < PROPFEMALE > LE > ( IL ) , < PROPFIRST > Ensign ( NV ) , < PROPFIRST > Brown ( < PROPFEMALE > ) , < PROPFIRST > Voinovich ( OH ) , < PROPFEMALE > Murkowski ( AK ) , < PROPFEMALE > Snowe ( ME ) , and < PROPFEMALE > Collins ( ME ) 
Acura SH-AWD complemented by VSA , TCS , and ABS ......... here I come ! 
One day I will have to build my own version of a < PROPMALE > GT3 RS ! 
A snow fall exceeding 2.2 inches will make Christmas < PROPFEMALE > 2010 the city's snowiest since 1969 . The last time a Christmas < PROPFEMALE > here produced a 2-inch snow was 13 years ago in 1997 . 
Me and all my friends/ We're all misunderstood/ They say we stand for nothing and/ There's no way we ever could/// Now we see everything that's going wrong/ With the world and those who lead it/ We just feel like we don't have the means/ To rise above and beat it/// One day our generation/ Is gonna rule the population/ So we keep on waiting/ Waiting on the world to change 
Bowled my record best of 135 today ! 
Have a fantastic weekend coming up ! REI Member’s Garage Sale --- Oakbrook : 12/30/2010 Northbrook : 12/31/2010 Schaumburg : 01/01/2011 
Signed the lease last night with < PROPFEMALE > Krogh ! 
There is no stop sign ! Why are you stopping ??!?! .... I honk , and you give me the finger ! Hello , this is how people get rear-ended ! And ironically , when there is actually a stop sign- you'd probably treat it like a yield sign , or ignore it completely ! 
going snowshoeing today ! 
Chatted with the owner of the most environmentally friendly vehicle I have ever laid eyes on ! A Hummer H1 that runs on 100% vegetable oil , has a small solar panel , and has recycled tractor tires ! 
Learning some basic Chinese phrases tonight . This should be interesting ! 
Inexperienced winter drivers : PLEASE go to an empty parking lot and PRACTICE . You'll build amazing self-confidence in yourself & your vehicle . * If you aren’t being reckless , you shouldn’t have a problem with the police . If anything , they'll be grateful that you are safely learning how to control your vehicle in adverse conditions . * 
18 inches of snow ! 40mph winds ! Negative temperatures ! The ultimate test for my brand new Columbia omni-shield winter jacket and Yukon < PROPFIRST>'s snowshoes . Cannot wait for this storm ! 
[ Temperatures in some parts of the Midwest will dip well below zero . Visibility will be virtually zero at times In Chicago , the National Weather Service warned high winds could produce waves on Lake Michigan of up to 25 feet , leading to considerable coastal flooding and freezing spray . Chicago could see its third-biggest snowstorm , after 1999 and 1967 . ] 
When all is said and done , will we still feel pain inside ? Will the scars go away with night ? Try to smile for the morning light . It's like the best dream to have , where every thing is not so bad ... Where are those secrets now , that you're too scared to tell . I'd whisper them all aloud , so you can hear yourself ... [ Angels & Airwaves , ' A Little's Enough ' ] 
Morning Cocktail : Advil , Claritin , Vitamin A , Vitamin C .... and Kleenex as my sidekick ! 
\Legend of the Guardians : The Owls of Ga'Hoole\ " is one of the best animated movies that I have seen in quite awhile ! " 
I would give anything for an indoor batting cage right now ! And some White Castle sliders .... 
Today , my KEENS will be making their first 2011 appearance !!!! 
The basketball game tonight was beyond unbelievable ! But come on guys , you have to shoot if you want to score . And you have to make those three pointers !!!!! 
if you were my headlamp , where would you be in my room ? 
leaving for < PROPFEMALE > in 10 days !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Jessup Hall will be my second home for the next week , although that really isn't anything new ... 
FACT : Every professor assumes that you have nothing else to do except study for that course . 
83 hours until take off ! 
15.5 hours before my Environmental Impact Analysis exam – 1 hour of class – a few measly hours of sleep . 412 powerpoint slides + 52 word pages + 60 pdf pages + and a years worth of literature on NEPA is on the agenda . And by 2pm Tuesday , 50% of my EIA grade will be set in stone And then it will be time to think about Biogeography and Planning Livable Cities . Oh yeah , and I need to pack too !!!!! 
WEDNESDAY ------- 8:00 - 9:15 Environmental Impact Analysis exam . 10:30 - 11:45 Biogeography exam . 1:00 - 2:15 Planning Livable Cities exam ...... 
19 hours until take off . So much to do still 
And so the journey , half way around the world , to < PROPFEMALE > begins ... 03/1 0---0 3/22 
I have never been so thankful for western plumbing . 
it just after 9pm in Beijing , and I got out of bed an hour ago ... today should be interesting . 
Studying for Planning Livable Cities .... More importantly , listening to Green Day ! 
Saw a guy on a Yamaha YZF-R6 today .... I haven't thought about the Kawasaki Ninja 250R that I am getting when I am 26 in some time , and now that is all I can think about ! 
There is a big difference between a wound and a scar . Wounds are still bleeding , while scars come with healing . Every scar has a story , and my scars remind me : that I have survived , that healing is possible , that hope is real , and that love is attainable . They give me reason to believe in myself , because many people will never be able to say that they have made it this far . 
First bike ride to the Coralville Mall of the year !!!!! Suspect weather , but it seems that it will hold out .... hopefully ! 
Discovered a new fruit today , the tangelo ! I have eaten more than I care to admit ! The tangelo is a citrus fruit that is a hybrid of a tangerine and either a pomelo or a grapefruit . It is amazing how quickly it can be peeled , and how many seeds there are ! 
Biked out to City Park with a picnic and a camping chair ( with a foot rest ) , and reclined while reading Biogeography articles while listening to < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , Three Dog Night , < PROPMALE > Marley , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , and The Beach Boys . Looking forward to more days like this !
