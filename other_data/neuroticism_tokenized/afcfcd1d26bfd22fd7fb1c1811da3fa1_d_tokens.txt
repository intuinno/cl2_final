remembers 2010 like it was yesterday ... 
is starting 2011 off right - black beans , saffron rice , tomato soup , acai/coconut water , Bebel < PROPMALE > on Pandora , patio door open with beautiful < PROPFEMALE > view .... it's so tropical . Welcome , 2011 ! 
patio is all done now ! Well , I need some hibiscus but they aren't out yet . Got palms , and furniture set up . Now all I need is more warm weather ... come on , spring ! 
Has gold polish on fingers & toes now - ready for Who Dat Super Bowl and Mardi Gras ! 
I can hardly believe this : < PROPMALE > & Havard have been friends since they were 2 years old . She is < PROPFEMALE > of Momus this Mardi Gras ! Congrats , Havard ! I can't believe you are all grown up ... 
desperately needs a calm , quiet , relaxing , stay-at-home weekend . Last weekend was a bit much . Super Bowl excitement is over . And , no , I'm not going to Mardi Gras . 
had a sweet day today : cake balls , Chinese < PROPFEMALE > Cakes , < PROPMALE > proposal finished , questions answered , lashes done , and hair cut . And going to bed early ! 
lemongrass chili tofu from Pho 20 ..... heaven ! 
< PROPFIRST > has been here over 48 hours now and hasn't played a single video game ! He has hardly even watched tv , either . He & friends have played Nerf gun wars all weekend outside . Just like when I was a kid .... 
had a fab time last night with < PROPFIRST > at ArtWalk . So great to see everyone ! M&M is still gorgeous , and the food was outstanding . I'm working on a playlist for Voodoo Lounge . T-5 days til Spring Break ! < PROPFEMALE > and girls are coming . Weather better hustle up and clear out ! 
I left Pandora playing Bebel < PROPMALE > on a computer in my classroom , then had to leave students unattended . I warned them not to touch my Pandora , and that I didn't want to come back to crazy music . I see that I now have stations for Wisin y Yandel , Ahora Es , Alacranes Musical , El Guero y Su Banda Centenario ...... in other words , crazy music . They have a lot of ' splaining to do manana ! 
update on the Pandora Incident : each student blamed the other , so I'll never know what really happened . But that's OK ; they were all subjected to classical Indian sitar music today . 
is so done with high school drama ! 3 girls cried in my room today - 1 in 1st period , 1 at lunch , and 1 at the end of the day . Sadly , none of it was because of boys ; all problems at home . I seriously need Spring Break . And I seriously need some food . 
has a very long to-do list for the next 9 days .... wake up to the sun instead of alarm , go to the beach , read books , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , pack away sweaters , go shopping , eat Indian food , spend as much time as possible with my kids , speak no Spanish , get a massage , open all the windows , get mani/pedi , get lashes done & hair cut , have tires rotated , finish the Baha'i Fast and prepare for Naw Ruz . Whew ! 
got Bomba Estereo on Pandora , packing away sweaters , picture-hanging guys coming later , getting lashes & hair done this afternoon , is sad for neighbor's dog getting run over on Seawall yesterday ... RIP < PROPFEMALE > . 
is swapping out fall/winter makeup & nail polish - here comes Spring ( someday ... ) . Bye bye , black eyeliner ! 
found Bajofondo on Pandora . Sounds like I'm in a Kill < PROPMALE > movie . 
It is a rare happening , but this year and next , all the Christian calendars will coincide and Western ( Protestant & Catholic ) and Eastern ( Orthodox ) churches will celebrate Easter on the same Sunday . 
turned on the AC for the first time this year . Bye-bye $85 electric bills ... 
is having a fun time hiding posts on fb .... Now I don't have to waste time scrolling through farms , zoos , cafes , aquariums , wizard schools , egg hunts , mafia wars , islands , fishing adventures , or hearts . I also hid friends whose political or religious rantings irritate me , so don't be offended if you don't see yourself . I still love you . I just don't agree with you . 
I'm watching the woman ahead of me in line with her healthy stuff . Then I examine my basket : slimfast , peanut M&Ms , hair color , air freshner . you can see where my priorities are . 
at the Greek Festival with < PROPFIRST > . First one since < PROPMALE > , and the church isn't finished yet . OPA !!!!! 
Is more than ready for this week to be OVER !!!!!!! 
whoa ! what was that storm we had last night ?! my patio is a disaster . it is gorgeous & < PROPFEMALE > with a nice seabreeze this morning . I'm on the balcony watching the triathletes pedal on 3005 . 
is eating tacos at Float jamming to some < PROPMALE > Marley . It feels like summer on the island ..... 
is enamored of my new apartment to an extreme degree . Projects & decorating are just about finished . The mini-chandelier in my shower/garden tub is the icing on the cake ! 
Thumbs up : < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > of the Children's Center , Spurs , Heat , my rain showerhead , $70 electric < PROPMALE > . Thumbs down : TAKS testing the rest of the week . 
< PROPFIRST > was 1 question away from scoring ' commended ' on his math TAKS test ( 5th grade ) . He missed 5 . Reading scores aren't back yet ; he took science today . He hates my TAKS cheer : \Do . your . best ! Rock . tha t.t est ! \"" 
just read that Cirque du Soleil is designing a show based on the music of ... < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > !!! Should be out end of 2011 . I cannot wrap my mind around that .... I love MJ , and I love Cirque ... but that's just too weird . 
is taking the day off tomorrow . I got a sub to be the teacher so that I can go to skool and actually get some effin ' work done ! 
Happy < PROPFEMALE > Wars Day , everyone ! May the 4th be with you ! And happy Cinco de Mayo tomorrow . What's this about Phoenix wearing \Los Suns\ " jerseys ? Que bello ! " 
is the definition of \exhausted . \"" 
is excited about dinner with a girlfriend tonight at 901 Postoffice , then checking out the view at Bar None in < PROPFEMALE > Beach ( next door to me ) . If you wanna join us , come on ! 
is out on the balcony watching the waves roll in and the clouds float by . It's a beautiful , breezy evening . 
Happy 2nd Anniversary to my bro < PROPMALE > , and my favorite sister-in-law , < PROPFIRST > ! \Happy Anniversary\ " song from the Flintstones is now stuck in my head ..... " 
is ready for : holiday weekend , end of school , the pool . Not ready for : hurricane season , tourists driving on Seawall , summer school . 
is out on the balcony in the darkness watching the clouds glow as lightning dances in the sky . Magical . 
low pressure + low wind shear + high water temp = busy Atlantic hurricane season this year . 20+ named storms ?! This is not good news . I'm worried about Haiti . 
every news/weather station in the < PROPMALE > area was out on the Seawall this afternoon giving their gloom & doom hurricane season prediction . Storm season begins today and runs through Nov . 30 . Our busiest month for storms is August . 
spent a nice long evening with my sister-in-law & her family . Her mother passed away Wed . Funeral is Monday . RIP Marilla - we miss you . 
off to a sadly busy start this week .... funeral home with < PROPFIRST>'s family this evening , first day of summer school tomorrow , then Marilla's funeral tomorrow at noon . 
is having a blast teaching summer school ! only 4 students - I can't believe I'm getting paid more than regular school . 
my cell phone number spells \OCD\ " - total coincidence . And don't y'all get any funny ideas about putting me on that \ " OCD Project\ " show either . " 
Happy 21st Birthday to my first child , < PROPMALE > Wells Forsythe !!! 
watched part of a \new\ " City Council meeting . Really like the cozy ' roundtable ' setup . Maybe they will actually get along better . " 
is watching the Kardashians on E . Who ARE these crazy people ?! What a colossal trainwreck . 
decided today that every time I go grocery shopping , I'm gonna pick up an extra jug of water and gatorade . I'm getting ready for these stupid tropical storms . 
Grupo Fantasma tonight at HoB ..... I love that band !!!!!! 
having a drink at Bar None with @ < PROPMALE > Forsythe & @ < PROPFEMALE > Lilley . Fabulous view ! 
on June 19 , 1865 , Union troops arrived in Galveston with news that the Civil War was over , and that all remaining slaves in Texas were free . Islanders are proud to be part of history . Happy Juneteenth ! 
you guys can go ahead and start praying for me now ... I will be cleaning < PROPMALE>'s apartment & doing his laundry tomorrow . He's been really sick . Actually , the laundry may take all weekend ... 
I'm off to a good start with my summer get-fit program . < PROPMALE>'s AC isnt working well , so it was 82 degrees inside . Sweated my A$$ off cleaning over there today for 3 hours ! 
is getting ready for the Luau here this afternoon ! Food , drinks , DJ , inflatable giant slide , lotsa fun ! 
I'm so mad - why won't my crackberry & fb play nice ?! I'm trying to upload these pix of the luau party ! 
ok people , I apologize for jinxing the match with my jokes about \it's Ghana be a great match ! \ " and \ " who's Ghana be the winner ? \"" 
felicidades < PROPFEMALE > ! 
so Chile was the first South American team booted . Who's next ?! 
last day of summer skool . Massage , lemongrass chili tofu , ONE coconut water , hot bubblebath , rainy night , I'm all set ! 
wants to see \The Last Airbender\ " - I LOVE Dev Patel ! and all these rainy days are providing the perfect excuse to see it . " 
just because there's a goalie in the net doesn't mean you can't score ... 
is headed to Wal-Mart . < PROPFIRST>'s chore $ is burning a hole in his pocket . Maybe < PROPMALE > will actually be stocked since most of the tourists decided not to come here . 
< PROPMALE > & I are trying to figure out ways to make this coconut water taste better . 
Happy Independence Day , everyone ! Celebrate your freedoms today ( and every day ! ) . My favorite \freedom\ " song : \ " Freedom ' 90\ " by < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST >." 
cannot believe I just found Kerastase hair products at Target ! $33 is slightly more expensive than buying online , but this is worth it . 
What ?! I hear firecrackers outside . Those kids musta not done a very good job last night , or they wouldn't have any left . 
What did the Atlantic Ocean say to the Pacific Ocean ? Nothing . It just waved . 
spent a nice fun long evening just hanging out with < PROPMALE > . We even watched tv ! I <3 < PROPFIRST > Bieber ! 
peace , love & shoes !!!! 
can feel it creeping up , closing in .... the urge to paint walls is growing stronger every day . I am resisting , but I see it in my future . Like next week . 
needs help here ... why are they removing the old stoplights at Seawall & 81st in the middle of Friday afternoon ? Really ? This couldn't wait until Monday when the tourists are gone ? It is a 4-way stop now . 
had a wonderful afternoon at the beach house with < PROPFIRST > Court , < PROPFIRST > Sullivant , < PROPFIRST > Peters , < PROPFEMALE > Weaver , and the rest of the Peters clan . Looking forward to tomorrow ! 
waka waka ... arriba Espana ! 
is having a really great summer ; summer school was fun , painting project is going to be gorgeous , and good news keeps coming about changes for the upcoming school year . Now , if I could just visit Miami before school starts , that would be the icing on the cake ! 
is having lunch with < PROPMALE > at Que Cafe . They have plaintains !!!! I am sooooo excited ! 
just realized that I still have < PROPFEMALE > singing \waka waka\ " as my call tone . Guess it's time for that to go away .... " 
still can't get enough of Broken Bells ' \The High Road \"!!!!!" 
watching the ESPY awards - this is absolutely the best awards show I've ever seen . 
ohhh kayyy .... some help here - why is a bounce house set up at the nursing home out here ?! It better be \family day\ " or something . And y'all thought < PROPFIRST > was weird ! Ain't nothin like Galvetraz . " 
just had very interesting ride in the elevator with 2 12 yo boys : boys arguing , then one asks me if it is possible to buy a house for $ 100,000 . Apparently , one boy thinks yes and the other thinks no . At 12 years old ?! I just told them to focus on girls for a while . 
is so excited ! < PROPFIRST > just called ; they are getting off the plane in < PROPMALE > already . He's been in NY with his dad for 10 days . Yay < PROPFIRST > ! I missed you ! 
watched \No Country for Old Men\ " again . I still don't get it . Everyone's dead except < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Jones and < PROPMALE > Bardem . And where's the money ? " 
thinks that if you have to wear shoes , you're not really on vacation . You're just somewhere else . 
had a fun time shopping for new cell phones for < PROPFIRST > Court today . And a big thank-you to < PROPMALE > Forsythe for helping me paint the wall yesterday . It is gorgeous !

spent the past 8.5 hours helping < PROPFEMALE > Mendoza pack up to move back to Ecuador . I . am . tired . 
Happy Birthday to my brother < PROPMALE > !!! 
thinks the Bengals-Cowboys game tonight might be interesting . The Bengals may have T.O. , but that's not gonna be enough to beat the ' Boys . And nobody better put a \Cowgirls\ " comment on here ! " 
noooooo !!!!!! < PROPMALE > , your joke came true - Lady Gaga is on < PROPFEMALE > 99.1 right now ! \Paparazzi \""

had a great time with my family today ! Have a safe trip home tomorrow . We are so glad you could visit ! 
ugh . I wore heels today for the first time in 6 weeks . And of course I thought I'd be sitting all day ... You can guess how my day was . \Back to life ; back to reality ... \"" 
loves twitter ! I don't tweet ; I just like to follow people who have fun things to say . I like < PROPFEMALE > Noor , < PROPMALE > Sanz , the Dalai Lama , Questlove , and < PROPFEMALE > Milano . I'm StalkerMagnet , if anyone wants to follow me . But please , no stalking . 
new scent from febreze : yumberry & sangria . Got the wooden block diffuser . Highlight of my day . 
ah , the first Saturday of the school year ! I slept all the way through 1st period . Why are my eyes so puffy this morning ? Sure feels good to catch up on sleep ! 
Salsa Sunday on 101.1 KLOL , dark sweet cherries , clean laundry , more febreze thingies , and breezy beachy sunshine ! 
< PROPMALE > is setting a record - this is the hottest month ever ! And , weirdly , this past Dec-Jan-Feb period was the 6th coldest on record for < PROPMALE > . I need a * dislike * button for climate change ! 
this August ended up being the hottest August on record for Galveston ( since 1871 ) , and it was the second-hottest month ever . 
drank iced coffee this a.m. for the first time in forever and was supremely industrious all day . Laundry , mopping , sanding ( that's dusting on the island ;-)) , organizing , even fixing things . Now I can enjoy the weekend ! 
well , this is fun . We have a coastal flood warning , a flash flood warning , and a wind advisory all until 7 p.m. Tuesday . At least it is a bit cooler . And we've got some good wave action going ! I want to drive down Seawall and watch the surfers . 
L'Shana < PROPFEMALE > to my Jewish friends ! And today is the anniversary of the Great Storm ( hurricane of 1900 ) that killed over 6000 people and prompted the building of the Seawall . 
Who dat say dey gonna beat dem SAINTS ?! And what is this Krewe of NFL ?? 
Who Dat !!!!! How ' bout them Saints ?! This season I'm focusing on my Cowboys . 37 Super Bowls have been held in NFL stadiums , but the home team has never played . Host it AND play in it , < PROPFIRST > ! 
Happy Patriot Day ! My man < PROPMALE > Sanz has a zillion Latin Grammy nominations this year . Igor is the creepiest name on the storm list . I'm driving around the island taking pix for 2nd anniversary of < PROPMALE > . 
My top picks for male singers who have the best voices : < PROPMALE > Presley , < PROPMALE > Groban , < PROPFIRST > Hadley ( Spandau Ballet ) , < PROPMALE > Rucker , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > Sexton , < PROPFIRST > Gramm ( Foreigner ) , < PROPFIRST > Legend , < PROPMALE > Sanz , < PROPFIRST > Hagar . 
Feliz Diez y Seis ! I'm moving back to my old classroom tomorrow - yay ! and I saw < PROPMALE > today - that's always a good day ! 
wow , < PROPFIRST > - thanks for all this wind & massive rain . < PROPFIRST>'s bedroom window is leaking BIG TIME , and now so is mine ! The other windows and glass door are protected by the balcony above me . This place weathered < PROPMALE > and was supposed to be fine .... 
if the ' Skins find an offense , the Texans could get scalped today . I think the Cowboys will feed the Bears and they will go hibernate . 
I am disappointed - really thought the Cowboys could pull it together at the end . That < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > is good - no wonder they pay him top dollar . Looking forward to next week when they whoop the Texans ! 
is glad that Monday is over . This has been an idiotic day . 
I give up . I tried , I really did . * sigh * Arrived early to school today to find that my classroom was part of a crime scene . And then CSI man took my big bottle of favorite , expensive lotion to test for prints . That was the worst part ! I hope he brings it back . 
Dear Lord God , I understand that in Your infinite wisdom , You are trying to teach me lessons about being flexible , letting go of material things , humility , etc . It would be a lot easier for me if You'd just give me the powerpoint and let me study it . Please , no more pop quizzes ! Thank You , 
sat in an inservice all day today and came home to a clean house ! GumboFest tomorrow on the Strand , dinner and < PROPFIRST > Sinatra , Jr. tomorrow night with < PROPFIRST > Sullivant , < PROPFIRST > Peters , and their Dad . Tired of the rain , but looking forward to the cool front coming ! Oh , and the Cowboys will win on Sunday . 
fall is finally here ! Do you guys feel that ? Football at < PROPMALE > & < PROPFIRST>'s today - tv's in separate rooms - one for < PROPFIRST > fans , one for < PROPMALE > fans . I'm going to model how to be a sore loser so < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > can start practicing now . Go Cowboys !!!!!! 
How bout them Cowboys ?!!!! Yeah babeee !!!! Now come on Saints ! 
quick ! what was the first music video played on mtv ? that's right , the Buggles ' \Video Killed the Radio Star \"!!!" 
what do Metallica , DMB ( < PROPMALE > Matthews Band ) , and U2 have in common ? 
just got cussed up & down by the people upstairs . They have been super-loud all week , and I went up there . My mistake . You know I hate confrontation , and that man was in my face , yelling and cussing . I wish we had security cameras here . 
Thought for the day : the word \awesome\ " ends in \ " me\ " not \ " u . \"" 
is transitioning closets again , since summer is finally over . In one of these sweater boxes under the bed is my oversized , ancient < PROPFIRST > Cowboys sweatshirt ... it's going back into rotation ! 
is not moving !!! The woman above me had actually already been asked to move out - cops were called on \rude dude\ " by someone else about a month ago . Ahhh ... < PROPFEMALE > strikes again . " 
Thank you for all the birthday wishes ! It is a gorgeous day on the island . I'm going to lunch with my kids , and then ArtWalk this < PROPFEMALE > with my sis-in-law . I hope you all have a wonderful weekend as well ! 
needs to find the Little Miss Cupcake truck today . It's my birthday !!!!! 
Happy 10/10/10 friends ! Have a great day ! 
is not watching football today , but last night I predicted that the Texans would lose & the Cowboys would win . How did I do ? 
loves new Snuggle exhilarations white lavender & sandalwood dryer sheets ! 
Texans MIGHT be able to pull it off today , but it will be close . Not looking good for the Saints or the Cowboys . 
early voting begins today !!! 
whoa !!! anybody else see this ?! there is a HUGE orange Halloween < PROPFEMALE > hanging very low in the sky . gorgeous ! 
the Heat will crush the Celtics tonight ; now that Romo is outta the way maybe my guys can play some freaking football ; and what's this ? < PROPMALE > Horror glee-style tonight ?! 
Yesterday's high of 92 in < PROPMALE > broke the record of 90 , set in 1991 . Fall is on its way though - just in time for the Greek Festival and Halloween !!! 
it's the Great Pumpkin , < PROPFIRST > Brown ! 
is taking < PROPFIRST > to round up some last-minute costume pieces , then to the Greek Festival with < PROPFIRST > Peters , < PROPFIRST > Peters , and < PROPFIRST > the Man . This is my favorite festival all year ! Opa ! 
needs to escape the island this coming weekend . Any ideas ? It's Bike Rally weekend , and unbelievably loud here . Maybe I'll go to H-town & stay with < PROPFEMALE > . 
Please pray for my sister < PROPFEMALE > . She is in St. < PROPFIRST>'s hospital in < PROPFIRST > with a blood clot in the base of her brain . I'm headed there tomorrow . Note to Universe : my last post wished for a getaway this weekend . This is not exactly what I had in mind , but thanks for trying to help . 
is having a fun late lunch with < PROPMALE > at Float . Tacos , floor-to-ceiling windows open , on the beach .... ah ! I feel like I'm on vacation . And the 12 hours I slept last night didn't hurt things any ! 
What a different Sunday morning this is compared to the last 2 !!!! Hospital stress vs new < PROPMALE > Groban CD , open windows & ocean breeze , Galv & < PROPMALE > newspapers . I'm even thankful to be doing laundry & dishes !!! 
got a lot of Christmas shopping done yesterday . < PROPFIRST > is here for the week ( his bday party will be Sat ) , and planning Thanksgiving with the Peters clan . 
Happy Thanksgiving !!! Hope everyone has a wonderful day/weekend . Looking forward to the Saints/Cowboys game today . But truly , to shop or not to shop - that is the question . 
tonight I'm thankful for more things than I can count , which is a blessing in itself . 
is shopping from the relative safety & sanity of her own home today . Amazon.com will never be the same !

goes back to skool tomorrow for 3 weeks , then 2 weeks off . The Peas are slated to be the entertainment for the next SuperBowl . Last night , the Mavs beat the Heat for the 13th time in a row . My baby turns 12 tomorrow . That is all . 
Last week one of my coworkers went on a cruise out of Galveston . Today she told my students where she went . Guess how many Mexican kids knew where Cozumel is ... Cancun ? Tulum ? Exactly one . He said to the others , \They are on Joo-ca-tan ! \ " Then we had a geography lesson with a map of Mexico . I love teachable moments ! " 
Happy 1st day of Chanukah , happy World AIDS Day , hope my bro < PROPMALE > got his eyeballs back in place after watching VS show last night on his new tv , and happy early birthday to my favorite sister-in-law , < PROPFIRST > ! 
thought I might hafta go all gremlin on my students today because they wouldn't zip it while I was on the phone ; got my new glasses & sunglasses ; still like < PROPFEMALE > Church's version of \The Prayer\ " best ; and wishes someone would wave the magic wand for my sister already . " 
OK , finally got on laptop so I could change profile pic . This is Hadji from < PROPFIRST > Quest . According to my mother , I had an imaginary friend with that name . Guess she didn't monitor my tv-watching like she does her grandkids ' . At any rate , he had a lasting effect on me - I love all things Indian !!!!! People , food , colors , saris , festivals , religions , history , mendhi , Taj Mahal .... Can't wait to go someday ! 
the Mavs won their 12th straight game ; my Cowboys need to beat Vick & the Eagles tonight ; I either never knew or completely forgot that < PROPFIRST > Depp was in the first \Nightmare on Elm Street ;\ " guess I was too traumatized by < PROPMALE > Krueger . " 
is on the road again ... I'm tired , cranky , and just want to go home . When I get home , I'm gonna get a massage , take a long hot bubble bath , and sleep for 2 days . 
I dunno about this Cowboys game ..... I called it for the ' Boys at my sister's house before it started . 
wow , Gamestop is crazy busy on the day after Christmas !!! 
had fun shopping the sale at Pier 1 . Headed to Clear Lake tomorrow for Cuisine of < PROPFEMALE > lunch with < PROPMALE > Forsythe & < PROPFEMALE > Magnan . 
is glad the rain is moving on . Getting ready for some winter weather ! < PROPFIRST > has ear infection - going back to clinic today . Time to remove the \WhoDat\ " from my fb name . " 
well , looks like I will be staying home tomorrow with a sick kid . Dr said his ear looks horrible & it's draining nasty stuff . Too bad he was misdiagnosed on Wed - he could've been well by now ! 
the antibiotics & eardrops are working , and < PROPFIRST > felt better today . I bought him a new video game for being such a compliant patient with the eardrops . We will both be back at school tomorrow .

happiness is a big to-do list and a free weekend . 
today , happiness is freshly squeezed clementines & tangerines from a friend's tree for breakfast . 
happiness is realizing that I overstocked on the last 2 grocery trips , so I don't have to go today ! 
is working on lots of projects around the house this weekend . And I dig it when Haircut One Hundred pops up on my English Beat Pandora station ! 
is listening to \In tha Club\ " with a girl singing in Vietnamese while waiting for my to-go order at Pho 20 . Interesting . I think I like this version better . " 
well guys , there will be something missing at the big game on Sunday . That's right , no cheerleaders ! The Packers & Steelers are 2 of 6 NFL teams that do not have cheer squads . 
just found out that I do not have the clotting disorder that my sister , aunt , cousin , and various other family members have . Hallelujah ! 
is a wee bit lacking in the sleep dept after the fire alarm went off at 1:30 a.m. On the coldest night of the year , of course ! Entire complex , not just my building . 1st time in the year I've lived here , but apparently they had a problem before . No fire . Just freezing . 
no school tomorrow - we are expecting snow/ice ice baby on the beach ! gotta remember to turn off 5:20 a.m. alarm . and hope fire alarm doesn't go off ! y'all have a safe , warm evening . 
is having a relaxing ice ice baby day ( no snow here ) . I have done nothing except read the newspapers , watch HGTV & House , and accept a FedEx package . That poor guy was massively bundled up ! 
happy birthday to < PROPMALE > Marley & < PROPMALE > \Never Gonna Give You Up\ " Astley !!!! Looking forward to the party at my bro's ( don't care about the game ) . " 
Tide comes in , tide goes out . Never a miscommunication . I need a day like that today ! 
thinks that money must truly grow on trees . Why else would banks have branches ? 
lemon cake balls for breakfast , < PROPMALE > Ferry on Pandora , < PROPFEMALE > skies ... gonna be a wonderful weekend ! 
is meeting < PROPMALE > & < PROPFIRST > for lunch at Yaga's . Crossing my fingers tonite for < PROPFIRST>'s premier Latin party band , Grupo Fantasma , as they are nominated for a Grammy ! Next Sunday , brunch at the Hotel Galvez will have a Mardi Gras theme . Anybody wanna go ? 
Galveston.com has pix of the Flagship Hotel redo/demo/whatever they're doing . The mermaids are gone . So are the top & bottom floors . 
I couldn't stay up to watch the Grammys last night , so I'm reading the list of winners now - I see all my peeps !!! Congrats to Grupo Fantasma from < PROPFIRST > , < PROPMALE > Houghton from Lakewood Church , Arcade Fire from the Woodlands , and my favorite guys < PROPFIRST > Legend and < PROPMALE > Sanz !!!!!!!! 
man's body on beach at 44th street . 
is picking up to-go lemongrass chili tofu at Pho 20 .

has this to say about Galveston : if paid parking on the Seawall does not pass , and if they lose < PROPMALE > LeBlanc , I'm leaving Galveston . No one has any sense here ! The tourists need to pay , and < PROPMALE > is one of the best things to happen to this town . UGH ! This is the craziest place ! 
is sitting in the eye dr's office at Baybrook Mall with a student who didn't have a ride to her appt . Too bad I'm not here to shop . Appt is at 4 , then next door to get glasses . We may be here for awhile ... 
so , she finished eye exam at 5 and we went next door to pick out frames . Then we ate & walked around . Checked in periodically , and glasses were finally done at 6:45 . Took her home to Bacliff , drove back to Galvetraz , stopped at Walmart to buy snacks & gatorade for my testers tomorrow , and am about to fall into bed . We have to be at skool early all this week because of TAKS ( 6:50 ) but at least they feed us . 
5:15 - time to make the donuts ! My cell phone alarm just went off - and then so did the electricity !!! Not the best way to start the day ... guess I'll get up and drink my slimfast in darkness and see what happens next . 
wants to know what the flip Galveston city council is thinking . Who came up with this bright idea to get rid of < PROPMALE > LeBlanc ? And when ? It was just brought up last week and they are scheduled to vote on it tomorrow . I swear , if he is ousted and paid parking doesn't fly , I'm moving to Key West . They keep a clean city and squeeze a lot of $$$ out of tourists . Make us look like nutjobs . 
Dear CenterPoint Energy : YOU SUCK . 
is watching a long parade of CenterPoint trucks on 61st street .... Get to work , guys !!! 
just read post on galveston.com that city council voted to terminate < PROPMALE > LeBlanc . * < PROPMALE > dislike * I gotta hit the sack but will catch up tomorrow . 
\Zombies on Mainland\ " - or so warns the TXDoT sign at the island end of the causeway ! Wish I could've snapped a pic . "

Happy < PROPFEMALE > Wars Day , everybody ! May the 4th Be With You !!! ;-) couldn't resist ! 
Happy Cinco de Mayo ! Apparently , it is a much bigger holiday in Texas than it is in Mexico . My students couldn't understand why I wanted to have a fiesta . But they finally agreed ; any excuse to have a party , right ?! 
Today is also National Prayer Day . And , the fine for illegally parking in a handicapped spot doubled to $500 . 
In honor of Mothers ' Day , post the names & birth weight of your children if you are a proud Mom ~ < PROPMALE > Wells Forsythe 9lbs 9oz ~ < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Court 8lbs 9oz ~ 
Tomorrow is Career Fair at school . I have to babysit 17 sophomores , none of whom are my students . Lord , please let the day pass quickly and without incident . By that , I mean \please don't let any of them call me \ " Mees'\ " - I need a break from that title . " 
Rain !!!! 
big congratulations to my younger son's school , < PROPFIRST > Middle School ( Science , Tech , Engineering & Math Magnet Program ) , for winning a National Title I Distinguished School Award . AMS is 1 of only 2 schools in Texas to receive this award ! 73 winning schools nationwide . Google \Title 1 schools\ " to understand what obstacles GISD is overcoming . " 
my quirky sense of humor must be rubbing off on my 69 yo mother . Today she left me a vm that said , \I'm celebrating < PROPFIRST > Wonder's birthday today . I just called to say I love you . \"" 
what a gorgeous Saturday !!! 50% humidity on the island - that's as low as we ever get . Get out & vote if you didn't already - show the Seawall some love !!! 
Paid parking on the Seawall passed !!! 61% of voters had some sense , finally . January is the projected start date . Now that the Flagship has been demolished , things are starting to look good on the Bouvelard . Can't wait to see the new amenities - did you know there isn't a single water fountain along the 9.7 < PROPMALE > of Seawall ? That's embarrassing . 
Should you find yourself a victim of other people's bitterness , ignorance , smallness or insecurities , remember things could be worse ~ You could be one of them ! 
soooo ... the < PROPMALE > LASTROS now have the worst record in the League . And speaking of losers , I have a bum shoulder . No MRI , but suspected torn labrum with tight interior rotators making up for it . I'm gonna try heat , stretches , ice for 2 weeks . That better fix it , that's all I'm gonna say ! 
One of my friends from high school in < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > Attal , is going to fly helium-filled blow-up dolls like kites today at 6:00 in honor of the Rapture . Those photos are gonna be awesome !!! 
Finally found yummy coconut water !!! Goya es lo mejor !!!

& < PROPFIRST > are home from < PROPMALE>'s birthday party . Well , I guess we were actually at the PRE-party ... there was tons of yummy food courtesy of < PROPFEMALE > , and ice cream birthday cake . Happy 22nd birthday , < PROPMALE > ! We <3 you !!!!!!!

Rain !!! 
I think I was an < PROPFEMALE > Traveller in another life ... can't decide which wedding I liked better - the hot pink or the turquoise ! 
TS < PROPFEMALE > , please toss some rain our way !!! 
< PROPFIRST > got a haircut , then we had time to kill before getting teeth cleaned . We ended up at < PROPMALE > & < PROPFIRST>'s . Me : this is probably not the smartest thing to be doing right now . < PROPFIRST > : we're gonna have it all scraped off anyway . They don't care what's on our teeth when we get there ! 
needs to do some grocery shopping before the tourists clean off the shelves . 
trashy new neighbors below , elephants above , no lights at all in the pool or on the lampposts in the pool area , trash in stairwells , stained concrete everywhere , dog urine in elevator ... good grief ! I want out of here when my lease is up . Not worth all this $$$ . 
Happy 235th birthday , U.S.A. !!!!!!!!!
