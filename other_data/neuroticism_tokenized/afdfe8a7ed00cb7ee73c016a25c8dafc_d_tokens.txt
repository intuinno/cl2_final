He had a word , too . Love , he called it . But I had been used to words for a long time . I knew that that word was like the others : just a shape to fill a lack ; that when the right time came , you wouldn’t need a word for that any more than for pride or fear .

The Girl you just called fat ? She has been starving herself & has lost over 30lbs . The Boy you just called stupid ? He has a learning disability & studies over 4hrs a night . The Girl you just called ugly ? She spends hours putting makeup on hoping people will like her . The Boy you just tripped ? He is abused at home . There's a lot more to people than you think . Put this as your status if you're against bullying .
