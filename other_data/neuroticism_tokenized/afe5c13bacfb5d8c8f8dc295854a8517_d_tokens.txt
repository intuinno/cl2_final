No matter how much they say they might love me , I know it's only a joke ... in my favor , love doesn't last long , so if any1 ever fell somehow in love with this one ... i reject them ... like that ... for i know it own't last ...

an not only that , well I got myself a new phone , a pantech ease to be exact , i can't really use it at it's full potential at the moment since i have to install the other software ( can't use the new laptop yet ... ) but ohterwise , it's great so far , can't wait to see what adventures or misadventures lie ahead of me ... 
if i were to < PROPMALE > in 5 subjects .... i might take up teaching , culinary arts , politics , psycology , and ... uummm some kind of lab science , im pretty interested in genetics , but yet i love cooking and I also happen to love heated discussions and helping ppl by figuring out how they think ... i have many interests/loves don't I ...? blowing stuff up is fun ... :D
