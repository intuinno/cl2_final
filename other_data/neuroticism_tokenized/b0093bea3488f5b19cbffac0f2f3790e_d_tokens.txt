Talk about rude awakening !!! At 8 this morning , I saw a flash of lightning and then it thundered right after !! It was so loud !! THE GROUND SHOOK !!! I don't think I'll ever get out of bed that fast ever again ! 
If all my friends were to jump off a bridge , I wouldn't jump with them . I'd be at the bottom to catch them . :) 
A good friend is the person who helps defend you from those who try to take advantage of you , helps you put the past behind you but understands when you need to hold on to it a little longer , stays with you so that you have confidence , smiles for you when they are sad , helps you become a better person , and most importantly loves you ! \ 
I love my friends and I hope I can be as good to them as they are to me . 
The worst way to miss someone is to be seated by his side and knowing you'll never have him .... \
