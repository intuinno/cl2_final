Life is like a Burning Fire 
Missed training sunday but that wont happen often . 
Has an awesome new Display Picture 
RPW show on saturday was amazing ! Faverate part of my match with < PROPMALE > was when i got chokeslamed on the back of my head ! It was painful and i could taste the blood but thats what made it so memorable . 
is Watching < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Dam vs < PROPMALE > Hardy for the Hardcore Title ( 2001 ) 
is Watching < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Dam vs Kane at Summerslam ( 2003 ) 
Watching < PROPFIRST > Evans . Enough said . 
Going to go watch this weeks NXT . 
Life is like Burning Fire 
Just created an awesome new finisher . ( Blue Bird Slam ) 
Is feeling kinda blue . Can't sleep . 
WWE banned chair shots to the head . How boring .. 
\Straight Edge means im better than you\ " -CM Punk- " 
\Creatures of the Night\ " - < PROPMALE > Hardy- " 
Some people are so blind . 
My finisher is awesome -Blue bird slam- 
Just finished watching \The wrong side of Town\ " staring < PROPMALE > Batista and < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Dam . " 
Blue bird slam ! 
Training today was awesome . Im really impressed by everyone who was in my match . This is the first time ive ever put together a proper match and was really suprised by the reaction we got . The finish was fantastic . This was probly my faverate training match ever . 
I really need to do a dive over the top rope or something at training some time soon . Ever since i nearly died ( LOL ) at a show a few weeks ago ive been asking myself a question . \Can i still dive over the top rope ? \ " Ive done it many times before but now something seems kinda different . " 
So the greatest Wrestmania Match was followed by the greatest RAW episode i have ever known . Like myself < PROPFIRST > Michaels found God and for this only good things will happen . 
Hmm well its 4am .. Might aswell go to sleep i guess . 
Really wish we had training this week . 
NXT is so awesome . Next week someone will be eliminated ! I hope its < PROPMALE > Young . He just looks so ridiculous and he can't wrestle . 
Its killing me theres no training this week . 
Hmm well today turned out to be less boring than i thought but thats not allways a good thing .. 
I love being from the Rock and Roll < PROPFEMALE > of wrestling . 
Finally fount a website where i can order my style clothing . Not that i dont like Sheffield but ever since i moved here ive fount it very hard to find my style of clothing . There were a few good shops but not exacly what i was looking for . Now i have finaly fount it ! Also im guessing this will have a slight impact on my wrestling look ^^ . 
Been doing loads of leg streches everyday now for the past Month . Making alot of progress and i think after 1 more month of this and i should be able to do the full splits easy ^^ . 
< PROPFIRST > bourne used my \Blue bird slam\ " finisher on WWE Superstars this week . " 
Training today was pretty good . Had a great match with < PROPFIRST > . I think my faverate part of the match was when i was setting up for split leg moonsault and < PROPFIRST > caught me and hit an awesome slam . I forget the name . Also i got to showed off my new RPW shirt . 
Cant wait for the next show . Im totally gonna blue bird slam somebody . 
Would like to make my Blue bird slam finishers debute at my next show and maybe even my other finisher i exchanged for my Swanton bomb . 
Just ordered some knee pads . 
Tomorow night at the RPW show in south kirkby , nothing will stop me from achieving Championship gold . I will hit Blue bird slam to any individual who dare gets in my way . 
Tonight at the RPW show in south kirkby i won the triple threat opening match and i won the main event < PROPMALE > rumble match ! Last two people i eliminated were < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > . So let this be a warning to all of you . Im rising straight to the top . 
393 show is gonna be awesome . Also maltby sounds good . 
Was just looking at some pictures on < PROPFEMALE>'s profile from the RPW maltby show and the ceiling looks really low .. this could work against me ... 
Its amazing how many people suddenly go single on facebook . Guys just dump girls from out the blue . Some guys are just so dumb ... 
There are somethings in wrestling that are just so uncool . I mean is it too difficult to see things from someone elses point of view ? Everything is ego this and cocky that . Cant you just be a champ and enjoy it ? 
SPLIT LEGGED FREAKIN MOONSAULT !!!!!!!!!! 
Ah my new knee pads came today ^^ 
Just modified my new knee pads . 
I wanna make a song about chinese food ! 
Tomorows show and saturdays show are gonna be awesome . Blue bird slam ! 
Has just created a new wrestling focus called \Sage Mode \"" 
Well the show is over and it was awesome ! The crowd was slighly agressive and the ceeling was super low but it was a fantastic show . 
393 show was awesome . Got hit in the back by a cane . Hurt lol but was awesome and i believe < PROPFEMALE > has got some awesome pictures . 
I have to say every so often theres a show thats so good and i learn so much that it makes me sooo thankfull for the spot i have . And that spot was given to me problerly way before i was ready for it lol haha . After tonight i feel like im on a hole new level . 
Woke up this morning and my back is fine but my left knee feels pretty torn up some how . I would not have been able to make training . Anyway im gonna try and take it easy for a few days and if its still bad then i guess ill go to a hospital to see whats up . 
I look pretty damn hot in my display picture lol . 
Hmm .. do people consider me an average height person ? or a little under average ... 
My left knee seems to be all healed up now . I will be at training this week . 
Sooo close to being able to do the splits now ! 
Finished lifting weights and is now doing leg stretches . 
Just had a shave ^^ and i only cut my self 36 times . 
Im so bored . Won't somebody come along and make my life a bit more interesting lol . ^^ 
Has got a new hairstyle . 
Training today was awesome . The high-flying part of the session was fun . I attempted to help some of the new guys which ended up with one of them giving me a slight noes bleed but whatever . 
Damn Knee is giving me problems again . As if that wasnt enough already . 
Im gonna do the right thing now . I can see that alot of people wanna bring me down . But anyway im gonna put all this behind me and move on . I didnt mean to offend anyone . But my future means alot to me . 
Bought myself 2 three disc set wrestling DVD's Today . The Ladder Match and The < PROPFIRST > Guerrero Legacy . Not that i really need it but i might pick up some new wrestling tips and stuff . ^^ 
Back from Spain and will be at training this week . 
Cant wait for this weeks training . 
Im having a good day ^^ 
I am a Wrestler . I am The Blue bird . I am unbreakable . I am a follower of God . I am < PROPMALE > Crow and i will not die . 
Today i saw a baby bird fly out of its nest . It was doing pretty well untill it flew into my window that i had just cleaned .. i was like \HUHHHHHHHHHH !!!!???? \ " I ermm couldnt breath i was laughing so hard :O " 
Just got back from Karate which i havent been to in about 7 months and im glad i am just as good as what i was back then . Maybe even better . ^^ 
I really like my new display picture . 
I wish people could be more understanding and not make me make choices i dont want to make . Well im a good person and i have a strong faith in God . Im shure peace will return to me . 
Just got back from training and today ive been in the best tag team match ive ever been in or if not then its probly my faverate one . It would take too long to explain why the match was so good but i can say that < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > showed great natural ability . 
The Blue bird is feeling better today . 
Waiting 4 months to do a wrestling show is kinda dawning on me . I dont know how other wrestlers feel about waiting that long just to do a show but i mean i dont mind waiting but im young and i dont know what to say really . Does anyone else have an opinion on this ? 
Unfortunately i have just fount out that i have cracked my left heel . How this will effect my wrestling im not shure . Im hoping its only very minor and i should be good for training and upcoming shows but may have to take it easy . 
I got my new elbow pads today ! ^^ 
Thanks everyone . Had a great 18th . Involved no drinking and nothing incredibly stupid ^^ 
It appears that Family guy has stolen my character and put me in tonights episode . I aint gonna let this slide .. and im not kidding . They stole my name , my look and .. well this is not good . 
Just got the new < PROPFIRST > Jericho dvd . ^^
