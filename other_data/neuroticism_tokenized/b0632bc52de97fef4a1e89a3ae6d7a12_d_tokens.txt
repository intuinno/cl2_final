Everyone loves staying up late . It's cool right ? But what do you do when you're up so late that you've done everything you could do on the internet , everyone's asleep , and there's nothing good to watch on TV ? You go to sleep . Isn't that what you're supposed to do anyway ? Mom , you don't have to nag because I don't care about staying short till ' death , but I do care about being bored to death ! 
I'm going to school today ! Yay and boo ! Such mixed emotions ... 
1 advantage you get when you live in Memphis : You hear all the songs before the people in the North do ! 
I have an essay to type about what my expectations of 8th grade are ... \But let me do one more thing on Facebook . Please mom ! And then another thing . And another . And- Fine .. I'll get off . \ " :( " 
After I got home from school , I went to sleep until now ... I can stay up and eat but I have to go back to bed ... I have to wake up at 5:50 to get ready for school . But I won't be tired cuz ' I slept all day . :)

In Hugs Not Drugs , a person named < PROPMALE > said the reason why people join groups on Facebook just to disagree with them was \To challenge popular misconceptions and dispel myths keeping the dangerous practice of prohibition in place . What's the point in having a mental circle jerk of like minded opinions ? Truly understanding an issue comes from looking at both sides of an argument . \ " I totally agree with him . :D "
