So I have done it , one small step for < PROPFEMALE > , joining technological man . 

It is raining on the Prairie ! Something worth writing home about . 
Pouring down rain in Camas Prairie . A miracle 
Happy Summer to everyone . My solstice was rough\ 
A turning point , the first in 5 days with no fever . I have been ill , thought it was strep throat and I could tough it out , but I only got worse . Turned out to be tonsillitis , so now the antibiotics are working . It has been rather rough , but Ilya has been an out of this world doctor . 
Everything is going to work out !!! \ 
Peppers setting in the greenhouse , 5 little piglets eating slop , Cam loves me !!! \ 
< PROPFEMALE>'s growing fast and Fall will be here before I know it . 
Pigs love spinach ! Not to much trouble to pull up greens for them . \ 
Sudafed is my new best friend ( as < PROPFEMALE > would say)\ 
I can breathe again ! Done wonders for my disposition too !!!! 
Elan and < PROPFEMALE > braved the parched prairie and we all had a fabulous time . Happy critters all around , kittens , pigs , chickens , and < PROPFEMALE > too . 10+ gallons of peas left to harvest . \ 
Today I have been hiding inside doing mega laundry and organizing and sorting of belongings . That kind of thing makes my world feel rounder . Tomorrow : Dinner with < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > can't wait . 
p.s. : we ate the first ripe tomatos on Weds night . 
Looking forward to tying up loose ends !!! 
So many grasshoppers 
Thistles are dangerously close to spewing seeds , I can't wait for my weedeater parts to show up in the mail 
Thunder in the morning is an exciting way to start a Saturday ! 
Relocation complete ! 
< PROPFEMALE > Day ! 
Tomorrow is the day ! I'm so excited to be married to Cam Ulvick ! 
Kinda cold out , huh ? 
Happy Birthday < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Christmas Tree is up , fell down , up again , fell down , and up again . Cheap tree stand . At least we had fun cutting it down ! 
Did you \ 
hear about the Buddhist who refused Novocain during a \ 
root canal ? His goal : transcend dental \ 
medication . I am laughing my ass off . 
The soldier who \ 
survived mustard gas and pepper spray is now \ 
a seasoned \ 
veteran . I don't know why these make me laugh so ... 
A grenade \ 
thrown into a kitchen in < PROPFEMALE > would result in \ 
Linoleum Blownapart . \ 
I am easily amused . 
Just one more : The midget fortune-teller who \ 
escaped from prison was a small medium at \ 
large . 
smooth sailing ... 
Crappy , crabby day ... Tomorrow's horoscope sounds horrible ! uf ... 
Happy Solstice !! It's all brighter from here on out ... 
Looks like we won't get fresh snow for Christmas ... But at least there is more snow on the ground than last year !! 
Instant blizzard ! Winter-like conditions ... How exciting ! 
What happened to the ice pellets ? I was excited ... 
Well , there's still hope for those ice pellets . 100% < PROPMALE > for tomorrow . 
45 degrees out today . < PROPFEMALE > put on her sleeveless dress to play in the sun ! 
finally I was blessed with about three minutes of < PROPFEMALE > ice pellets 
dreaming of gardening ! 
So much typing .... Not so much a fan of these internet classes .... blah 
I LUV THIS ! PLEASE put this as your status if you know someone who has been eaten by dragons . Dragons are nearly unstoppable and , in case you didn't know , they can breathe fire . 60% of people WON'T copy and paste this because they have already been eaten by dragons . 38% of people are sitting in the shower armed with fire extinguishers , and the remaining 2% are awesome and will re-post this . ( and this is serious !! ) 
lol 
what a nice < PROPFEMALE > day ! 
Is it cold where you are ? 
I hate the compacted frozen mud that collects in the wheel wells . Especially when it is so cold I cannot kick it off ! uf . 
I hear birds singing this morning ! 
unfortunately , the kitchen sink is out of order ... 
The sink is back in action thanks to my super man ! 
< PROPFEMALE > picked a yellow flower for me outside ! The first bulbs are popping up ! 
lunchtime with Cam at home 
making shrimp < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > cake for the birthday boy ! 
mining manure on a < PROPFEMALE > day ! 
I heart brassicas ! 
I did the Macarena with a smurf in a hole becuase Big Bird said and he's my leader . 
I've got tilled dirt !
