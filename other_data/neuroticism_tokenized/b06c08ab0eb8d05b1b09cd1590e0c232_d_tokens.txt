believes that no one should die because they can't afford health care , and no one should go broke because they get sick . ( If you agree , please post this as your status for the rest of the day . ) 
would like to let everyone know that the purpose of the health care status updates is not to change your mind , or imply that you do not actually have the human compassion to want people to get healthcare . There are people who want to kill any < PROPMALE > ...... of reform , drown out intelligent debate , and present their opinion as that of the majority . The purpose of the status updates are to NOT be drowned out 
has 13 more days in EQ2 ... /sigh/ and only one more day left of summer ... NOOOO !!! 
wants all this school crap to be just a bad dream ... 
knows that instead of a bad dream , this year will either be a nightmare , or I'll die . Either one . Chemistry just appears impassible , and Trig seems impossible .

no longer despises trig with the aforementioned passion . But I still dread it every day . 
was on camera for her Japanese 2 converstion test . And also just saw a documentary on the underestimated ignorance/ control-fetishisms of legislation regarding nearly harmless medicine ; in other words , I sae a documentary on canabis . Ya don't know what it is , research it . 
is waiting ... 
has finished her English homework ! And is now in her snuggie like a bug in a rug .

has a fine neck again , but her back and abs still ache . 
HAS A MUDDY FACE ! 
had her back popped , and now I suppose that it got realligned from that icky neck-plant . I should be back to crappy walkovers in a week ! 
had a crap-ton of trouble with her keyboard -- it wouldn't work -- and will now go through everything at mom's! 
loves Five Below . It's like the dollar store ... only it's $5 , so you can get cooler stuff ! Like a power strip ! And pocket toilet paper ! And icky sweaters ! And notebooks ! It's like heaven ... or Costco ... or Bed Bath and Beyond ... 
I cannot wait until A ) I get my brain back through school and ( B ) GLEE starts back up ! OMG BLAINE+KURT = Blurt . <3 
I just went through the extras in the first season of GLEE that I got in BR , and now I'm having delusions of grandeur , since I think I may be a triple threat like they wanted in the beginning . Unfortunately , they probably get the most amazing people now . < PROPMALE > lost ! :/ 
wants to know which play will be performed in OCT's Shaking Hands with Shakespeare class in the summer ... 
family values : it doesn't have to make sense , anyone can use it to make things they don't like get repressed 
is an absolute moron . She deleted possibly one of the BEST scenes in A Midsummer Night's Dream from OCT of ' 09 . On accident . Thinking that she had saved it to the proper files . I hate myself so much right now for that . 
will NOM YOU HAIR ! 
Tra la la la la . 
barely gets free time in the week . It's either practice , a meet , family time , practice , or homework homework HOMEWORK . Or just plain school in the way . Geez .

took a LAWNG shower to get most of the product out of her hair ... WE WON ! OMG I was on the verge of sobbing with raw joy . I think I actually did sob , but since I could get no drinks from the BROKEN/LOCKED VENDING MACHINES and the lines for concessions had EIGHTY PEOPLE , I had no water in my system , so they were dry sobs . OMG OMG OMG WE WOOOOONNNN ! 
had a very productive day ! Yahoo !

' s bed got broken . Someone sat on it and SNAP a leg broke . Now it is being held up by books and random wooden boards from unmade shelves . I would have preferred a brick or cinderblock , but you can't have everything . Most certainly a faultless bed . :-P 
needs to get some sleep on her broken bed ... 
is feeling very nice and clean and rested and ahhhhhhhhhhh . 
realized several parallels between < PROPFEMALE > Wars and Indiana Jones . Other than the very presence of < PROPMALE > Ford . Oh the sexiness he once possessed .
