Stand up , all victims of oppression , \ 
For the tyrants fear your might ! \ 
Don't cling so hard to your possessions , \ 
For you have nothing if you have no rights ! \ 
Let racist ignorance be ended , \ 
For respect makes the empires fall ! \ 
Freedom is merely privilege extended , \ 
Unless enjoyed by one and all .

I must not fear . \ 
Fear is the mind-killer . \ 
Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration . \ 
I will face my fear . \ 
I will permit it to pass over me and through me . \ 
And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path . \ 
Where the fear has gone there will be nothing . \ 
Only I will remain .
