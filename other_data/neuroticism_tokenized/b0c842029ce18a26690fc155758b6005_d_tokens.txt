The cowboy met an old man who brought him some cuttings in a damp burlap sack . The old man said \plant these in the valley where the fog comes at dusk and the soil is stony and no good for anything else . And someday you'll have some fine dark wine . So dark that is turns your teeth purple\ " .... so the legend goes .... Purple Cowboy wine - supports Tough Enough To Wear Pink " 
is wondering what the work week has in store this week ... hope everyone had a good weekend .

It takes 7 seconds for food to pass from mouth to stomach . A human hair can hold 3kg . The length of a penis is 3 times the length of the thumb . The femur is as hard as concrete . A woman's heart beats faster then a man's . Women blink 2x as much as men . We use 300 muscles just to keep our balance when we stand . A woman has read this entire text . A man is still looking at his thumb . Repost if this made you smile ! 
I'm loving the snow !!! There are plans of snowmobiling coming from the couch ... we'll have to see what the temps are going to be over the weekend . 
Ready to say good bye to 2010 ... overall a great year - with a lot of ups and a lot of downs ... I am ready to see what 2011 brings . I am so very thankful for my family and friends - more than they could ever know . Hope you all have a safe and Happy New Year !! 
You and I wake up in jail together . Using only 4 words , what do you say to me ? Note : If you comment you must copy and paste this to your status so I may comment on yours as well . Be a good sport and play along ! 
HUSBAND WEEK : If you have a husband who is your best friend , who works hard for you , who has been with you through thick and thin , who loves you even when you're at your worst , and whom you are PROUD to be married to , copy and paste this with the date you were married : 6/28/86 
TGIF ... I am ready for this week to be over - snowmobiling over to < PROPMALE > tomorrow ... should be tons of fun !

I am so over the sickness that keeps going through my teller line ... flu ... cold ... flu .... cold ... enough is enough - especially when its my turn !! 
My mom has made me laugh , wiped my tears , hugged me tight , watched me succeed and fail , cheered me on , kept me going strong and DROVE ME CRAZY at times . Moms are a promise from God that you will have a Friend Forever . Put this on your status if you love your mom , whether she's here with you , or in Heaven . Mothers do their her very best to raise you to be the best person you can be .. Thank you Mom - you are the best !! 
I am NOT liking the weather forecast ! If I wanted rain I would still be out in western WA .... bring on the snow ! 
Unlike most of the time - why does the weather man have to be right this week ?? I suppose that I can sacrifice the 5\ of fluffy new snow we got yesterday for the several feet of snow that is suppose to be falling in the mountains . " 
To everyone who is calling for stricter gun laws in light of the tragedy in Tucson , may I offer this little tidbit of information : If guns kill people , then pencils misspell words , cars drive drunk , and spoons made Oprah fat ! Remember : Hold the person accountable for their actions , not the means they chose to utilize !!! ( Reposted from another friend's status message . Feel free to do the same . ) 
TGIF ... busy 3 day weekend for us ... will be a lot of fun though ... 
Had a GREAT time in Hamilton for Preslie's 2nd birthday party ... gonna relax and enjoy the rest of my 3 day weekend ...

Copy this and paste it in your status if you know someone , or have heard of someone who knows someone . If you don't know anyone , or even if you've heard of someone who doesn't know anyone , then do still copy this . It's important to spread the message ...

I believe in the right to keep and bear arms . One Facebooker has challenged all gun owners to put this on their wall . The Supreme Court of the United States has affirmed that the right to keep and bear arms is a fundamental right of the individual . If you Believe in the 2nd Amendment and you are not afraid to show it , re-post this ! 
Monday again ... I am wondering what this week will bring ... I am praying that God will bring health and happiness to my teller line - and for the rest of the branch ... its been a long two months w/all the sickness that has been hanging around in there . 
I need to find a second job - or another job - that will pay me enought to cover both < PROPMALE > and my paychecks ... that way I can keep him home 24/7 to cook , clean and .... well you know ... He made the most amazing breakfast burritos this morning .. yummmmm ...

Life is too short to wake up with regrets , \ 
So love the people who treat you right . \ 
Forget about the ones who don't . \ 
Believe everything happens for a reason . \ 
If you get a second < PROPMALE > , grab it with both hands . \

Tried out < PROPMALE>'s new sled yesterday ... only got stuck 4 or 5 times - in 5 hours of riding ... boy am I out of shape .... but had a blast - thanks to < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE > for coming to play .. 
Moms think about their children day and night . Moms love their children in a way that they will never understand . Moms will be there for their children when no one else will . Moms would take a bullet , jump in front of a train or ask God to take them instead of their child . If you have a child or children you love as much as I love mine , post this No matter what their age 
??? To celebrate < PROPFIRST>'s Day --- change your profile picture to a picture of you & your spouse/significant other and post how long you've been together .... we've been married 25 years this June - friends for 30 years . 
Last night ... T-Bones ... Shrimp linguini ... salad ... bread ... asti & fruit pizza ... YUM - Tonight ... Tilapia filets ... encore of the shrimp linguini ... salad ... bread ... asti & fruit pizza ... YUM ... Hope you all have a Happy Valentines Day !! 
I knew I was out of shape - but now I realize just how much ... my pilates dvd just kicked my ass ... I have a long way to go !!

Headed down to the Black benefit ... should be great food ~ great friends ~ great fun ~~~ and great things to bid on ... all for a really great mom ~ woman ~ friend . 
An old man once said ... There comes a time in life , when you walk away from all the drama and people who create it . You surround yourself with people who make you laugh , forget the bad , and focus on the good . So love the people who treat you right , pray for the ones who don't . Life is too short to be anything but happy . Falling down is a part of life , getting back up is living ~ Re-post if you agree 
So if anybody's brothers uncles sisters neighbor has a jeep for sale let us know . Looking for a 1980's , cj-5 or cj7 in running condition . Also looking for a snow plow that we could put on it .
