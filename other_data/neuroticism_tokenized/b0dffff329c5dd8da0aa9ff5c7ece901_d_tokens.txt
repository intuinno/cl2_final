The life of theoretical philosophy is the best and happiest\ 
a man can lead . Few men are capable of it ( and then only intermittently ) . For\ 
the rest there is a second-best way of life , that of moral virtue and practical\ 
wisdom . ( Aristotle , Metaphysics ) 
\ ... there are some who are naturally fitted for philosophy and\ 
Philosophical discussions habitually make men happy and joyful\ 
not frowning and sad . ( de Montaigne ) 
\Though we find ourselves in shadow 
And isn't it a bad thing to be deceived about the truth , and\ 
a good thing to know what the truth is ? For I assume that by knowing the truth\ 
you mean knowing things as they really are . ( Plato ) 
There is nothing more necessary than truth , and in comparison with it everything else has only secondary value . \ 
This absolute will to truth : what is it ? Is it the will to not allow ourselves to be deceived ? Is it the will not to deceive ? \ 
One does not want to be deceived , under the supposition that it is injurious , dangerous , or fatal to be deceived . ( Friedrich Nietzsche , 1890 ) 
Time is not an empirical concept . For neither co-existence nor succession would be perceived by us , if the representation of time did not exist as a foundation a priori . ( Immanuel Kant , 1781 )
