And maybe , I'll find out The way to make it back someday To watch you , to guide you Through the darkest of your days If a great wave should fall It would fall upon us all Well I hope there's someone out there Who can bring me back to you ? 
According to a birthday horoscope book , my birthday classifies me as a loner who ends up by myself on most occasions and that in my teen/early adult years I will begin to isolate myself from society and the human world ... now that I think about it ... it's kinda already true ... great , nice to know I'll become a hermit any day now -_- ... at least it said that I'm very in tune with nature ^_^ 
78 on Froner's midterm ... >.< oh well , at least my grade for his 3rd marking period is 91 ... 
If I write how I'm really feeling , I would sound really depressed and emo ... so I'll just put a smiley ^_^

People need to understand that children with special needs don't have an illness , so there is no cure & it's not contagious . They only want what we all want , to be accepted . Most of you probably won't copy and paste this Will you do it and leave it on your status for at least an hour ? It's Special Education week , and this is in honor of all the kids who need a little extra help & understanding .

today I won't be working in the office ... instead I'll be working from home ... oh joy ... 
my head is about to explode and I'm about to cry ... 
my boss thinks I'm working fast , I think I'm working slow ... guess that goes to show that I'm a workaholic and a worrywort ...

yay ! got my debit card for CUNY . now i just need to get the money in the card and then i can buy my books ! ^_^ 
why am I interested in something so cruel and scary ? 
I had a dream that I was dancing on a wire . when I stopped in the middle , someone was telling me to let myself fall . then someone else whispered to me telling me that it's alright for me to fall because they'll guide me back to where I belong . \ 
\ 
Anyways , < PROPFEMALE > Lammas everyone ! ^_^

my bro actually gave me books that I need for some classes out of the books he doesn't need anymore . it's kinda nice to have a bro who also goes to < PROPMALE > sometimes . 
finally got a new phone ! so please message me or contact me somehow and I'll give u my new # . < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > we'll figure something out , I'm sorry ! >.< 
finally finished with the work videos and my weekend homework . now to pack up for tomorrow . tomorrow need to finish buying textbooks , edit the website for work , and do homework . 
stupid train had to malfunction and took me almost 2 hours to get home by an alternative route . still have lots of work to do . looks like I'll be staying up past midnight for third day in a row . 
fourth day in a row I'll be going to sleep after midnight . and tonight I'll only have less than 4 hours of sleep . all you Chinese people know how unlucky this is . 
finally got new glasses ! ^_^ \ 
now I just have to get used to this dizzy feeling . 
thinking of buying a flute and relearning it ... 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Macancela I give in ! I'm going back to The Hunger Games ! >.< 
first quiz in Chinese Calligraphy tomorrow ! hope I do well . gonna study right before class . >.< 
< PROPFEMALE > Estil , < PROPFEMALE > Eng sorry but I can't go to yoga tomorrow . let me know how it goes . My boss called me in last minute to go in and get my paycheck . This better be worth it or else I might go with < PROPFIRST > Ng's idea ... 
~ does Fate enjoy mocking me ? does it delight in tossing those things in my face and seeing me cry ? ~ 
my < PROPFEMALE > Stokes calendar came ! so happy ! ^_^ 
so much reading homework ! >.< and I have to go to grandaunt's house tomorrow . it really sucks that my brain can't comprehend the skill of skimming . T.T 
My phone displayed a message for me saying my inbox is over 99% full . I check my conversations . out of the 525 sent and received messages , 415 belonged to < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > ! XO 
< PROPFEMALE > Xie ! I finally got them on ! ^_^ \ 
even though it took like 15 minutes ... but I'll work on that . 
I actually opened a twitter account to follow people like Allkpop , Tokyohive , and < PROPFEMALE > Marr ... * tear * it sucks that these days you can only enter contests if you have a facebook AND twitter ... 
I finally got my first pair of ballet shoes ! ^_^ \ 
it's only the soft ballet shoes , but I'll upgrade to the pointe shoes once I improve enough . 
it's really hard to focus on homework when you've had less than 8 hours of sleep for past few nights ... 
... I'm sick ... * sniffle *...* tear * ... 
< PROPFEMALE > Mabon and Zhong Qui Jie Fai Lok everyone ! ^_^ 
Meeting Lisi < PROPMALE > was awesome ! ^_^ 
everything hurts . it feels like every day something makes my day go from bad to worse . 
I don't know how I was falling asleep and still taking notes in Anthro >.< 
Is love not the most reasonable emotion in every person's life ? Everyone deserves and seeks love in their life . Without any form of love in one's life , life would seem without purpose . 
finally tossed out some junk and stuffed space takers into a spare closet . i freed up so much space in my room ! it makes me want to buy more books to occupy the extra space ... ^_^ 
Rainy Days Never Stay 
I hate studying ... Anthropology tomorrow and then Philosophy the next day and Media essay next week ... grrr ...

~ On the day of the dead the chilling wind howls past me whispering messages of the dead . Crisp dull-colored leaves brush by my ears telling me that nature is going into sleep with the spirits . Clouds surround the sky , but it is clear over my head . Oh what a perfect day it is for me , the Winter Queen . ~ ^_^ 
I almost got dragged into bellydancing in public ... twice ! >.<

this weekend must cram homework and essays . then next week is studying for finals . T.T 
even when we die , we live on in the hearts of others . may they live on worrying about their own lives because we alone can't take care of them if they can't even do it themselves . 
even though I still have classes on Monday , this weekend marks my official start of studying for my 5 finals . >.< 
good thing about waking up early is that my face won't show heavy bags no matter how few hours of sleep i get

just got home from one party and I have another one tomorrow 
I had a weird dream that a cat was kissing ( licking ) me ... and when it stopped , it shifted into a guy ... 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > : ur gonna be 19 and ur super innocent\ 
Shaffy Daffy : you're always mature haha\ 
I'm innocent and mature ... what a weird mix ... ^_^ 
I'm not superstitious , but this year July has 5 Fridays , 5 Saturdays and 5 Sundays . This happens once every 823 years . This is called money bags . So : copy this to your status and money will arrive within 4 days ... based on Chinese Feng Shui . The one who does not copy will be without money . I can't let that person be ME ! 
just finished Old Habits by < PROPFEMALE > Marr ! it was awesome ! ? Niall ^_^ 
not feeling anything at all right now ... it's as if everything's just passing by me ... \

there's so much I want to do in life ( Wicca , ballet , film , animations , travel , < PROPMALE > , books , and much more ) . there always seems like too little time to do them all . but I won't rush myself because I want to enjoy each accomplishment . 
finally finished Radiant Shadows ! loved AnixDevlin but did not particularly like RaexDevlin ... can't wait for Darkest Mercy ! ^_^ 
spring semester starts tomorrow and i now realized i haven't even started packing ... 
it seems all the gentlemen traded in chivalry for flirting , even fictional guys ... 
had a tummy ache after first class and went to Enchantments and Flower Power to buy herbs and incense . what a nice way to start the semester . ^_^ 
there's so much I suddenly want to write in my Book of Shadows . this is going to take a while . ^_^ 
does anyone have textbooks for Hist151 they would like to sell to me ? 
I got an email saying I made the Fall 2010 < PROPFIRST>'s List ... so what do I do with that ?... 
I really hate History ... took me 2 and a half hours to just skim through 40 pages ... now i have 40 more pages to skim through for Film ... 
< PROPFEMALE > Imbolc everyone ! As the Winter begins to thaw giving way to Spring , the Goddess begins to recover her strength . May her Light bring blessings upon us all . 
Tonight is doubly blessed . As Imbolc ends and gives way to the end of Winter , the night passes into the start of the Lunar New Year . Hop Hop Happy Chinese New Year everyone ! ^_^ 
Happy Year of the Rabbit ! May the Rabbit deliver prosperity quickly to everyone ! ^_^ 
what was I doing in my sleep that made me wake up with one eye stinging and red ? 
? Someday I hope these tears will stop running Someday after this darkness clears up I hope the warm sunshine dries these tears Every day I hold out comforting myself \it'll be alright\ " But little by little it makes me afraid I tell myself to believe in myself but I don't Now I don't know how much longer I can hold out ? " 
nothing brings peace of mind like tracing a pentagram in my room with rain incense * sigh * 
even though I don't have classes tomorrow I still have to go to school for the scholar meeting >.< 
pointe shoes really hurt , even with bunheads ... T.T but it's worth enduring the pain ... 
practiced flute and piano for 2 hours , scholar meeting for 1 hour , and countless hours of filming for a scholarship . what a productive day . now i just need to put the clips together into a video . 
I have to make a very scary decision on the next few years of my life ... 
thanks to a feeling I got when I woke up this morning and to < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Macancela , I finally made my decision 
I woke up feeling at peace . I think I dreamt of my Goddess . ^_^ if only I could remember the dream more clearly ... 
< PROPFEMALE > Lantern Festival everyone ! May the light and wisdom of the lanterns guide our paths in the rest of the year . 
I am about to watch Twilight ... I doubt lightning will kill/save me in the next 5 minutes ... 
my dad just said on the phone : you're a big girl now , you have to call me to let me know where you are\ 
IN WHAT WORLD AND WHAT WAY DOES THAT MAKE SENSE TO ANYONE ?! 
I have a Women Gender Studies quiz tomorrow and a History exam on Thursday and classes on Wednesday ... that means I won't be able to read Darkest Mercy for a while ... 
Darkest Mercy and Resolve finally released ! ^_^ 
just realized that I also have a film quiz tomorrow ... 
had a very nice and hopeful dream last night ^_^ 
came home to some pretty depressing drama and now I have to study for the history exam ( my worst subject ) tomorrow ... \ 
at least i have < PROPFEMALE > Marr's live chat to cheer me up tonight . ^_^ 
it feels good to just let the night winds < PROPFEMALE > my cries to the clouds ... 
the first time I'm cramming homework the night before ... 
so much reading and essays to do this weekend ... T.T 
so many Wicca tools and supplies I want to buy ^_^ 
hey guys . please don't call or text my cell for the day . my mom took my phone to the store to fix something . 
I officially went from being slow to being an airhead ... it took me 6 months and a stranger with the same phone ... to figure out where i can < PROPFEMALE > a phone strap on my phone ... 
even though I bought my wand online , as soon as I touched it today I knew I made the right choice when I felt its < PROPFEMALE > sync with my own * sigh * ^_^ \ 
now I just need to name it and bless it ... but I can't tonight because I'm sick ... 
Dream High ended ! * cry * 
my throat got worse ... 
can't wait for my cold to end . i want to start using my voice more already . need to practice more flute . also want to practice IU and Celtic Women songs . 
why do I feel so cold ?... >.< 
finally feeling better 
if anyone has any kpop music sheets for flute or piano , please let me know . I'm gonna try to practice some on Wednesday in music room .

finally got Darkest Mercy !!! and it's signed !!! hehehe . thanks < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Macancela !!! ^_^ 
my heart feels so uneasy ... I need to sleep with Stellia and Chamil tonight so they can comfort me ... 
thanks for all the birthday wishes everyone ! this birthday is very special for many reasons\ 
1 . it marks the beginning of the end of my childhood ( asian culture)\ 
2 . my chinese/lunar birthday is tomorrow , making tonight especially blessed ^_^ \ 
3 . it is Ash Wednesday and although I'm Wiccan and Buddhist , I find it pretty cool\ 
4 . in spite of the transition into college , I still have many friends close to my heart ? 
trying to figure out a lot of things in my life right now ... 
I finished Darkest Mercy !!! need some time to digest it ... the ending was a bit too perfect for the main characters ... but i do like the process of everything that happened and all the trickery ... 
I need to get a job this summer or else I'm going to get shipped to < PROPFEMALE > ... not that that's a bad thing ... it'll be nice and help me with all this depression , but it might be awkward with relatives I don't talk to that much ... 
even though I didn't get a very good sleep last night and a bunch of other things are still messed up , I still feel better after the meditation last night . thank you my Goddess and God . 
I was burning some passion flower incense to bring a peaceful sleep . but my mom comes in and sees and screams at me about fire hazards again even though it's on a long incense holder . now that put me in a bad mood . so I donated to support the Japan relief to calm myself down . 
not even passion flower incense can release me from these nightmares ... 
< PROPFEMALE > Chen is so special that I would wake up earlier than a school day for her ... -_- 
so exhausted ... time to collapse on my bed ... \ 
this weekend need to study for Film midterm , do homework , prepare for Ostara , and figure out a bunch of stuff ... 
took down some anime posters ... now my walls look a bit bare ... \ 
does anyone know where I can buy a bookshelf that can be nailed to the wall ? 
trying to do spring cleaning , prepare for Ostara , and study for film midterm feels like trying to cram a train into my head ... \ 
I chose train because right now I'm typing up information on the film Strangers on a Train ... 
< PROPFEMALE > Ostara/Spring Equinox everyone ! The day is equal with the night on this day . The time of the sun begin to get longer as the God matures . Life comes forth to celebrate with the Goddess and God of Spring's arrival . It is a time of fertility and change . So shed the past and welcome the future , whatever it may hold . 
I think I'm studying more for this Film midterm than I have for the SAT ... 
just got through Film midterm . now I have to study for Women Gender Studies midterm on Friday . 
considering making a photo collection of my Wicca ... 
pineapple 
ugh ! these History essays and homework assignments are going to kill me ! and I still have to study for midterms ... T.T 
I really need spring break to come already ...
