Today I overheard my sister's jerk boyfriend telling her that after his haircut he is going to look ten times better . My little brother then popped out of nowhere and said , \ten times zero is still a zero\ " . MLIA . " 
Two days ago , I watched New < PROPFEMALE > . There was scene where < PROPMALE > almost killed < PROPFEMALE > because she had a paper cut . It made me wonder why he doesn't kill her when she's having her period . MLIA 
Today , I read that when NASA first started sending astronauts in space they discovered that ball point pens didn't work in zero gravity . They spent a decade and 12 billion dollars to develop a pen that would write in zero gravity , upside down , under water , on any surface and tempatures that reached 300 degrees below zero . The Russians used a pencil . MLIA 
Today in spanish we were having a fairly large unit test . As I was taking it , I forgot how to say \wake up\ " and so I put my head down pretending to fall asleep . Sure enough my teacher yelled at me saying \ " Despierta ! \ " . Booyah . MLIA . " 
ate tangerines , strawberries , and persimmons ... throat burning ): crime shows are the best ( as long as its fake ) 
Today I went out to lunch with my 6 month pregnant cousin . All of a sudden she shouted ouch , Lady Gaga just kicked me . I looked at her confused for a moment until she explained that she and her husband are currently refering to the baby as Lady Gaga because they are currently unware if it is a boy or girl . MLIA 
I went to shadow at Platt Middle School ... Before the first class started someone said over the announcements \Welcome to PMS ! Please enjoy your first period ! \ " Highlight of my day . " 
Today my mother said that she didn't want to name her male canary . I was disappointed by this until I realised that my canary named Fawkes would now be living in a cage with He Who Must Not Be Named . Epic . MLIA
