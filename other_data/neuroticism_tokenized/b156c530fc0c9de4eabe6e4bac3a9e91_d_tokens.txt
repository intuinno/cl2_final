Please send some prayers/happy thoughts up for my awesome college < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Hutchinson who's in the hospital ... thanks ! 

Walked outside today and it felt like the best season of the year ... football season ! 
Congratulations to < PROPFEMALE > Gibson and < PROPFEMALE > Rogers Stevens who ran their first ever 5K race today and finished with amazing times ! Also < PROPFEMALE > won her age group :) . 
Well ... I don't think the Gamecocks are peeking early this year , but a ( lucky ) win's a win I guess ... gotta improve before we face SEC teams ... 
Money saving tip of the day ... if you think you want a new car , spend some time cleaning out your current car , on the inside and out , or pay someone to clean it for you . You may find that you really like your car more than you thought ! 
Coffee is the most important meal of the day ! 
So today at the doc , I read an article in a Women's Fitness magazine about buying workout equipment . It had a set of kettlebells in it- they were 5 , 7.5 , and 10 pounds . It suggested starting with the 5 lb one and working your way up to 10 . \ 
\ 
Sorry magazines , but I'm a < PROPFEMALE > Terror when it comes to workouts . Think I'll stick with the 15-20 lb ones from CrossFit . Why limit yourself ? 
So I really hope the storming holds off this morning for the race . Not so much for myself , but for all the hard work our C25Kers at work have put in ... 
Best of luck to < PROPFEMALE > Howell Hitch today at her CrossFit competition ! All those WODs will see who is boss when they meet \The Hitchinator \"." 
It was really amazing to see so many of my ACS Technologies coworkers and friends complete their first 5K this morning , despite the weather and sloggy trail conditions . Really proud of everyone ! 
Productive Sunday : yoga , house cleaning , and banana dark chocolate muffins <3 
Super happy about my new running shoes ( Mizuno Wave Inspire ) ... not to mention they were on sale & I got great customer service at Finish Line at the mall ! Can't wait to take them on a test run tomorrow <3 . 
Today was National Coffee Day ! I proudly celebrated with a white mocha from Bean Groovy ! 
Went yard saling with the handsome husband today ! Bought two < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > purses , a < PROPFEMALE > business card holder , and a hot dog :) . Pretty amazing score today- you can guess who got what ! 
* cues trash talkers * Way to start off my birthday month ... gonna be a crappy month anyway =/ . 
Panthers football + leftover Indian food ( yum ) + yoga later ... makes for a nice Sunday . 
Quote of the Day : In life , as in football , it's often tough to see downfield when the blitz is attacking ( Thanks < PROPFIRST > Miller ! ) 
I hate needles and blood and medical things . Let's just say there's a good reason I work in software development :) . 
“Here's to the crazy ones . The misfits . The rebels . The troublemakers . The round heads in the square holes . The ones who see things differently . They're not fond of rules . You can quote them . Disagree with them . Glorify or vilify them . \ 
But the only thing you can't do is ignore them . Because they change things . They push the human race forward . And while some may see them as the crazy ones , we see genius . Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world , are the ones who do . \ -- Apple Computer Advertisement \ 
Today marks 3 years of working here at ACS . Might not be much to some , and I'm still one of the newer people here ... but when you're 25 , 3 years is a good chunk of life . 
I wonder if corporate would do something if enough of us complain about the really rude CVS cashier at the West Palmetto store . I hate to say this , but when I walk in and see her , I immediately want to walk back out . 
Thanks everyone for the birthday wishes ! I'm super blessed to have such awesome friends and family like you guys :) . 
Ran and won ( 1st place female overall ) in the 1st Annual FMU ROTC 5k this morning . Nice way to celebrate 26 years ! 
Pretty sweet birthday weekend ... ran a 5K yesterday and got 1st place female overall , Gamecocks blew Kentucky out of the water , got 10 hours of sleep last night (!!!) , ate amazing Indian food today with the handsome husband and my sister in law , and got a Keurig , ipod shuffle , gift card , and running medal hanger as birthday gifts . 
Baking white chocolate chip pumpkin spice cookies ! 
Yay CrossFit games are on ! 
The < PROPFEMALE > Track Club kids inspire me every week . They train so hard & have such amazing , positive , attitudes . So many adults could learn from them ...
