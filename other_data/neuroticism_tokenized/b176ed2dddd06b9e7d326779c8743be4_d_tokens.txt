Happy New Year Everyone ! 
Had a great time at < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE>'s BBQ tonight ! Awesome food and fun times with friends ! 
Yay ! I love the nice spring weather ! 
Hoping this weekend rolls by quick since it's my weekend to work ... 
Having a nice relaxing evening . 
Hitting the treadmill , then back to spring cleaning today . Long list of things to do and so little time ... 
More treadmill , more cleaning , then relaxing before working the next couple of days :) 
In loving memory of every cancer patient , family and friends who have lost their battle with cancer , and the ones who continue to conquer it ! Put this on your < PROPFEMALE > if you know someone who has or had cancer . ? April is cancer awareness month . 
Another rainy day ... I'm thinking some sun would be good about now ... 
Just made my hubby some nice warm gooey brownies :) 
Busy day today , maybe tomorrow will be better ... 
Such a beautiful day today ! The sunshine is a perfect spirit lifter ... yay ! 
Hope you're all having a nice weekend ! 
What a refreshing morning ! Done on the treadmill and the whole day ahead to get some stuff done . 
Happy Mother's Day To All The Moms out there ! 
Came home from work last night and my hubby had fixed me a wonderful romantic dinner for Mother's Day ! He is so awesome and I am so blessed . 
Today is my son's birthday , looking back at many fond memories and feeling so blessed ! Hope he has an amazing day ! 
one ... more ... day ... working .... 
SUN ! So nice to have some sun today . Enjoyed being outside ! :D 
A very special person is losing a hard battle with cancer today . Very humbling and sad . My thoughts and prayers are with his family . 
Just got done picking up 100 plastic spoons out of the backyard ... my hubby just told me he may have left the box on the counter . We have a certain Mr. < PROPFEMALE > who likes to counter surf so I'm sure he thought they were there for him . Too cute ! LOL 
Every single one of you are on my friend list , as a result of a conscious decision . I wanted you there ! I am not only glad to count you as friends , but also family . Thank you all for being part of my Life ..! 
~ Somewhere a respiratory therapist is giving an asthmatic a breathing treatment , helping a quadriplegic cough , breathing for someone using a vent , & pumping the heart of someone in cardiac arrest . Right now , an RT is helping RN's and MD's save those who can be saved & die with dignity ... for those who can't . Re-post if ... you ... are an RT , love an RT , or appreciate an RT . HAPPY RESPIRATORY CARE WEEK !!!! 
couldn't resist ... this is just too funny : 1 . Go to Google Maps . 2 . Go to \Get Directions . 3 . Type \ " Japan\ " as the start location . 4 . Type \ " China\ " as the end location . 5 . Go to direction #43 . 6 . Laugh and repost . " 
Just got home from my granddaughter's 2nd birthday party . She is just too cute ! 
Really wishing I had a job that didn't make us work on holidays ...
