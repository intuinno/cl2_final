don't let someone elses opinion of you decide your opinion of yourself ! 
face value depreciates over time , but a true heart is forever 
got home from work at 5:30 , i get out of the car and a b-17 w . w . 2 bomber flies right over the house , had to be only 500 ft . high , wow !!!!!! 
sat out in the yard tonight listening to the frogs and the crickets the stars were beautiful . 
face value depreciates over time , but a true heart is forever ! 
It doesn't matter if the glass is half empty or half full as long as it doesn't go to waste ! 
never give up . even if you fall flat on your face your still going in a forward motion . 
< PROPFEMALE > , true friends will understand don't feel bad for something that is beyond your control . 
how do you get the courage out of discourage . 
nurture your mind with great thoughts for you will never go higher than you think .
