I have a theory . You can only have a certain number of good friends . As in , maybe not friends that you're ultimately close to , just good people . As soon as you cross your personal marker , and make another genuine friend , the proceeding friend from that cycle will become an asshole . kind of like , a little friend/asshole caterpillar .

I need to break this habit of opening < PROPFEMALE > bars like a < PROPFEMALE > ticket will be inside . Speaking of which , I wish more wonka < PROPFEMALE > would come out .
