Random morning visit from a good friend , Getting a new AC for the apartment , getting a new fridge as well and one of my dogs are giving birth to 3 more puppies . It looks like this day was the pick me up I needed . The thought still lingers but things are looking up ! 
God has his Devils I have my Demons . The next few days will a spiraling inferno . It ends now . Starting tonight , Time to fly . 
Sometime's we're just dummy's being pulled by the strings of the world . \ 
It's about time I cut those strings off and carve myself a smile . 
I was ready to Die , Now I'm ready live again . The hole will remain , the scars will burn , but the smile is real . Free for now . I can Breathe . 
Leave one for later . \ 
So I'm cleaning the apartment getting ready for my friends to come over and then my father walks in . \Jed want to come with me and Tito to walmart and costco ? \ " I ask him \ " Why we have enough food . \ " He goes \ " Don't you know what day it is today ? \ " I go \ " No not really\ " He goes \ " Ok\ " and walks away and as he walking down the stairs he say\ " Btw your mom's birthday is today\ " .... face palm -_-" 
On our way to pick up me madre and \I love the way you lie\ " comes on . In my head I'm going \ " hell yesssss\ " and my father changes it saying \ " oh hell no\ " leaving me going -_- ......... boooooo "

Facebook has been acting weird lately . I've been getting wall post notifications about a few hours to a day later . And I just started seeing pictures I've been tagged in about a week ago .... wtf ? 
I don't think I've ever had this much fun in a span of 5+ days and going . The next two-three weeks it's definitely going to get better . Starting the process of cleaning up the aftermath of last weekend .

I think the world record of un-tagging themselves under 10 seconds should go to < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Spencer-Esquire ..... Due to his failure of being a good person ! 
This is one extremely rough morning . 
We all share a drink we call loneliness , but it's better than drinking alone ...
