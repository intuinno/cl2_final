Life ...... 

HOW MUCH LIFE REALLY HONESTLY SUCKS ! 
Tried to sleep , and its now 3:39 a.m. , and guess who is still awake !! 
Appreciation can make a day , even change a life . Your willingness to put it into words is all that is neccessary . The thoughtfulness that comes from caring can accomplish more than you expect . It's nice to be important but more important to be nice . 
Wow , people just absolutely amaze me !! 
It just keeps getting better !! <3 
Whoo hoo ! 9 months today ! Yay month ! 
It's well worth the wait ! <3 
Just can't understand why the people you trust , really can't be trusted at all . And the ones you truly care about , just can't see it . ~ one of those days , one of those nights I guess . :( 
I am so thankful that I can trust the people that truly care about me . I am so greatful for the friends I have in my life , and care so much about me ! <3 
Sometimes we get so caught up in the future , we often begin to forget that when the right time comes , the ones we seek , and love , will soon realize what they have in front of them . And until then , we < PROPFEMALE > every moment we get to share with them ... 
\Today's the first day of the rest day of my life .. \"" 
\The best is yet to come .. \"" 
Just so you know .. 
When one door closes another door opens ; but we so often look so long and so regretfully upon the closed door , that we do not see the ones which open for us .. 
Often people attempt to live their lives backwards ; they try to have more things , or more money , in order to do more of what they want , so they will be happier . The way it actually works is the reverse . You must first be who you really are , then do what you need to do , in order to have what you want . 
I f someone listens , or stretches out a hand , or whispers a kind word of encouragement , or attempts to understand a lonely person . extraordinary things begin to happen ... 
If drinking is interfering with your work , you're probably a heavy drinker . If work is interfering with you're drinking , you're probably an alcoholic .. 
\The expected is what keeps us steady . It's the unexpected that changes our lives forever . \"" 
Thanks everyone for the wonderful Birthday wishes ! I really appreciate all the kinds words from everyone ! I <3 ya all .. Thanks again .. 
feel like buying a big bag of skittles and throwing them at people on the street whilst yelling TASTE THE RAINBOW ! 
So , apparently ... it is severely frowned upon to open a bag of skittles in the store and pelt your fellow customers with them , while yelling \Taste the Rainbow ! \""

Has been doing some soul-searching and all I've found is a gum wrapper and an old sock .. That can't be good . 
Even the longest journey begins with just a single step ... 
The things that hurt the most are the things you never expected ... 
I am thinking about running up to total strangers and saying \your it\ " and run away ?!? I wonder how well that will work out .. lol " 
Dear < PROPMALE > Brothers : Now that I'm an adult , I feel I'm am old enough to hear what the \Beep Beep\ " is hiding when Road Runner talks to Wile E . Coyote . ~ lmao .. " 
Who ever says \words can't hurt you\ " has obviously never been hit in the face with a dictionary ~ " 
I don't understand ... why is it that when you throw skittles at people and yell \TASTE THE RAINBOW\ " people get so mad ? ~ Whats that all about ?!? " 
Just :(

It isn't the things that are happening to us that cause us to suffer , it's what we say to ourselves about the things that are happening . ~ Pema Chodron 
There are things that we don't want to happen but have to accept , things we don't want to know but have to learn , and people we can't live without but have to let go ... 
Without forgiveness life is governed by an endless cycle of resentment and retaliation .. 
Don't let the fear of striking out hold you back . \

Inner peace can be reached only when we practice forgiveness . Forgiveness is letting go of the past , and is therefore the means for correcting our misperceptions . \

Aiden won his first round of tournaments ! So it's game on for Wednesday ! \ Go Reds ! \ " Whoo-hoo .. \ 
Giving up doesnt always mean you are weak ; sometimes it means you are strong enough to let go . 
Last tournament tonight .. Great seasons for the Reds ! \ 
17-6 Win ! Whoo-hoo ... \ 
Super excited for my Lil ' guy . <3 you \big bunches \"" 
And you know , when you've experienced grace and\ 
you feel like you've been forgiven , you're a lot more forgiving of other\ 
people . You're a lot more gracious to others . \

Has come to realize in the past few weeks , that no matter how hard one puts in thre effort , there is just some people whom will just never care .. \ 
And that's not my problem , as long as I still do ... 
Okay peeps , here's the update on my surgery . I \ 
will be going in on July 7th at 8:30 . Dr , Koch will be doing it at CCMH . Its actually scheduled for 11:30 . I will be having a \ 
Lymphadenopathy on my right side of my neck . So wish me luck . ? you \

I have a friend who will be keeping you all updated\ 
that day and the days after ... 
On my way down to CCMH to await for surgery ! Fun stuff .. 
Surgery went well .. Thanks to everyone for all the prayers and wonderful wishes . I am extremly sore , but hoping for a quick recovery ! Love you all . And thanks agian .. I will be seeing everyone soon ! 
In the ER.at CCMH . I'm getting admitted , and having surgery again today for complications on my neck surgery ... Wish me luck my friends . 
Still in hospital .. But , on a brighter note , ONE YEAR today ! Whoo-hoo !

How blessed I am to have ment you ... 
Looking forward to moving further ahead in my lifes journey .. 
Much thinking done the last day or so . And finally realized I need to move forward and allow myself some happiness .. <3 
Just watched < PROPFEMALE>'s got talent , and now I'm a bit distraught about the throwing of used dental floss at Howie ! Especially when he has OCD , and I , myself have been diagnosed with that . also .. Kudos to you Howie for holding ur composer . I completely agree that it was NOT at all funny ! 
So grateful that I can now express my feelings about things . And actually be honest about it .. Looking foward to days to come . Excited , an a bit nervous , but completely ready for whatever the the outcome may be . ( hopefully a great one ! lol . ) 
We all feel at times as though we are deficient in ways that other people are not . We must keep in mind that where the road is crooked , God makes it straight , and where our hearts are wounded , God makes it hole . Our spiritual perfection is not altered by our imperfect personalities . Forgiving others is the only way to forgive ourselves , and forgiveness is our greatest need . 
Again and agian , the impossible problem is solved when we see that the problem is only as tough decision waiting to be made . \ 
~ Robert H . Schuller 
Pain and suffering ends only when you want it to . Put your past behind you and move foward . Never back down from what life may throw in you face .., 
Life is about trusting our feelings and taking chances . Losing and finding happiness . Appreciating the memories and learning from our past . Sometimes it's the smallest decisions that can change your life forever .. 
I've dealt with my ghosts and I've faced all my demons . Finally contant with a past I regret . I've found you find strength in your moments of weakness . For once I'm at peace with myself . There comes a time in everyone's life when all you can see are the years passing by . And I have made up my mind that those days are gone .. I'm moving on . 
Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about the things that matter ... 
Don't let your past dictate the present and your future happiness , if you spend to much time looking into the past you'll never see what's in front of you . Slowly learn that the past creates who you are today , but it doesn't limit your current choices . Sometimes you have to get lost , in order to find yourself again ... 
I think < PROPMALE > the Builder should < PROPFEMALE > President Obama for using a copyrighted catchphrase : \Yes we can ! \"" 
I wanted a perfect ending . Now I've learned the hard way , that some poems don't rhyme , and some stories don't have a clear beginning , middle , and end . Life is about not knowing , having to change , taking the moment and making the best of it without knowing what's going to happen next ...

A person's life journey takes them through many changing stages .. Some happy . Some sad . Some you don't understand . But in the end , it's all part of life ... \ 
\ 
Some people change . Some people stay the same . Some people turn into someone you don't even recognize ... 
Sometimes it's the unexpected things that can change your life forever ... 
Without forgiveness , life is governed by an endless trail of resentment and revenge ...

Momma just went for surgery .. 
Moms out , and in recovery .. Icu from there . 
Mom is resting comfortably , going home to nap for a bit .. Bed , n hubby's pillow .. hehe . 
Just got back from hospital , mom is moved back into CCU . Had two strokes , one minor , and one < PROPMALE > . They won't know how much damage has been done for a few more days . So far she can not move her left arm , see out of her left eye , and speech is slurred pretty bad . But they aren't sure if that is due to the strocks , or to all the pain meds she is on .. will keep everyone updated . 
There comes a time in life , when you walk away from all the drama & people who create it . You surround yourself with people who make you laugh , forget the bad , & focus on the good . So , love the people who treat you right , pray for the ones who don't . Life is too short to be anything but happy . Falling down is part of LIFE , getting back up is LIVING ..
