The Fro-Hawk is in FULL EFFECT !!!

You mortals bore me . I shall return later ! 
is < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > and the mic is my Excalibur ! 
\On this day One shall Stand ... One will Fall . \"- Optimus Prime " 
has a show to rock and can no longer afford to fraternize with the likes of you . 
saved the world(the cheerleader bit the dust though ) , the damsel in distress and still had time to rock the show ! Life of a Rock < PROPFEMALE > Baby !!! 
is off to the Bat Cave ! 
is running late for his friend date !!! 
has left the building . 
has the right to fight for the right ....... to ... do stuff ... 
Life is like a box of chocolate .... Dammit ! I'm allergic to chocolate !!! 
For shizzle my nizzle this is the plot listen up ! You bizzles forgot slizzle does not give a *&@#$ ! 
If I had a dollar for every time a chick was tryna get at me .... speaking of which , can I borrow some money ?....... What ? 
Everywhere I go , everywhere I see . Oh Refuge ! When I was just a little kid ! 
Is The Chosen One ! 
is now holding auditions for his entourage .

So a guy walks into a bar ..... that's it ...... well if you wanna know so badly you ask him what happened next !!! 
I write the songs that make the whole world sing . 
If that nigga Lil < PROPMALE > is featured on one more song I swear ....... 
Excellent Tactic ! Attack when unprovoked ! I must remember that . 
You don't have to be < PROPMALE > to rule my world ....... but you should probably be really hot . I'm just sayin ........ its about compromise . 
The gig to night was bomb ! I had so much fun ! 
It's an odd feeling to know you were meant to do something but still have doubts . 
Seeing the future seems like it would clear up a lot of stress & uncertainty ... but on the other hand ... if you knew everything was gonna happen before it happened you'd eventually get bored . 
Can't have your cake and eat it too ? If I have or own a cake you can be damn sure I'm eating it ...... provided that I'm in the mood for cake . 
I'm The - I'm The Best ! I'm The - I'm The Best ! The Best You Ever had !

My sleep cycle this week has been completely , erratic , inconsistant , & just utterly off . 
Wow ! This is the 1st time in awhile I've woken up & not felt like crap . 
Happy Halloween ... 
is in transition ... 
T-Phillips 180 N . < PROPFEMALE > Ave < PROPFEMALE > , CA .... Its Goin ' Down ! 9-12 am ! 
7 days ... 
5 days ... 
4 Days ... 
3 Days ... 
2 Days ... 
1 Day ... moving to Highland ... :( 
Moving tomorrow is a FAIL . Now it's looking like it won't happen til Wednesday or Thursday of next week . 
In the middle of moving right now ..... 
Well ... I now reside in Highland , CA ..... 
End of Day 3 of the Move ... been liftin ' beds , tables & sofas like they're toy cars ... but damn ... I'm tired ... 
Day 4 of the Move ... I'm tired of moving sh*t ... I think I need a vacation ... 
Made it home alive ... Thank God !!! Time to make up for all the sleep I didn't get this week . 
Well I stayed up all night but at least my room is looking pretty good now . Time for some Zzzz ... 
really wishes it would stop raining .... 
I had no idea it was this late ... or early ... Just got through puttin up the tree . Now ... hmm ... to get some presents under them ... 
Less than 2 hours til Christmas . I don't know if I should go to bed , or stay up a little longer . This would be pretty early for me on any night . What to do ....? 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas Peoples ! 
Headed towards the < PROPFEMALE > area . What's up people ? 
Great ... rehearsal cancelled . If anyone wants to < PROPFEMALE > out while I'm in the area hit up my e-mail or cell . 
So damn tired of the power goin out !!! This place is starting to suck balls ... 
Well this is getting old ... 
Good times were had .... 
Too many questions , too few answers ... 
FML !!!!!! Just threw a < PROPMALE > .... My Car is Dead . 
FINALLY !!! I'm back online ! 
Yeah Packers ! Boo Halftime show !!! Whack !!! That show undermines any talent the B . E . P . ' s actually have . P.S. I'm not saying they have any ... 
That's more like it Lakers ! Play to your potential & you can beat Boston any day of the week . Kobe's the Truth !! 
.... I need a change of scenery .... 
Kobe ! The Black Mamba ! MVP ! The Truth ! 
Sometimes I feel like an alien : Earth is not my home .... 
< PROPFIRST > Pilgrim V.S. The World : I love this movie !..... don't judge me .... 
Sick ... this was unexpected . Hopefully this doesn't last too long . 
Apparently I've put too much faith in humanity . It's amazing what people will say or do with no conscience ... no sense of consequence or how their actions will affect others . 
Happy Birthday to ....... 
Did you guys know that me & < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > share the same birthday ?
