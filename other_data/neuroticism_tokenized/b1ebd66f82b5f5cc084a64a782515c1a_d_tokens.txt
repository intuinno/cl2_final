< PROPFIRST > died ... can i put it out of it's misery ... or mine ? 
good thing about my new office layout is that I can't work at my computer when the sun comes out . so since the black cloud that has been hanging over our court has now shifted I will be off to do something productive , clean the garage ! tt ...

if I can smell the cat box two rooms away it must be time to change the litter ... gtg before I gag ... 
Anybody understand the logic behind the extreme decibels of music played in clothing stores in the mall . My ears are ringing and at one point I was almost nauseous . Even < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE>'s had the volume kicked up in the < PROPMALE > dept . I want to rant some more but I have a headache ..... 
upright for the 1st time today . not going to last long though .... :(

Has anyone found a way to sing with post nasal drip ? It's more like Niagara Falls really and EXTREMELY annoying . Still it was fun to bring music into the CCD class . 
ok , post nasal drip aside , can someone stop the ringing , screaming high pitch buzzing in my head . I know , I could be from too much decongestion meds , but what's a girl to do ? 
my cat just laid down on my hand on top of the mouse while I was trying to scan FB posts .... she wants a lap better make this a quick check . night all ! 
D day coming --- I have to go into DMV to renew this year - to get a new picture and my vision check , they want to see all my grey hair . Well , they won't!!! oddly enough I don't have to take the test . 
on a day like today where everything that hasn't gotten done over the last 2 months is now suddenly urgent I just can get started on any of it . 
I would love spring if it weren't for the pollen . 
is going all over the house looking for the ringing items only to find it's still in her head ! 
Breakfast in bed and a dozen red roses , score ! I'm liking this day ! 
got to stay in bed an extra hour - < PROPMALE > did driving duties . :) found the instructions on how to make french toast on my computer . my most fav of breakfast made by < PROPFEMALE > the most awesomeist daughter of all ! the web is such a wonderful resource ! ( I'm ready to toss most of my printed cookbooks out and gain 2 shelves of cupboard space ! ) 
I remember when use to like getting mail . finally going though the stacks of mail piling up from my total aversion to opening snail mail and true tio form there is nothing but bad news and bills . oh and the truck loads of junk mail flyers . 
hanging out at funworks with my little netbook ... 
phone phound !

Hi facebook , long time no see . anyway it's been to nice to stare at a computer . Teacher Education classes are great fun . It may sound like I don't mean it but I do . 
my cat just fell off the window sill . she \fell\ " asleep . Good thing my desk is only 4 inches down . She barely woke up to notice ... " 
well .... sinus surgery first thing tomorrow . wonder if it will make a difference in my snorting and coughing .... 
Another week is starting and big things are going to happen . like this big giant box in my family room will be uncovered and our long awaited HDTV will be a reality . 
Thinking about my friends at New Haven School , < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > , hope your having a good first day back . 
Ok so here's an update : I was gone from Thursday to Saturday night to an absolutely awesome Kindermusik convention in SF . When I got home , the cluttered , disorganized house I left was miraculously replaced by a clean , neat and organized space , living room , kitchen , family room .... the credit for this transformation goes to my daughter . con't ... 
g'nite ... 
Ok FB don't steal my morning just checking in OK ? 
< PROPFEMALE > Agostini big TV meant big changes in the house . I've been playing musical furniture in our house for the last 2 weeks . That includes painting and cleaning carpets . \ 
\ 
Anybody need a bunk bed ? white metal tube style , full/twin mattress included if you want them . All in great shape , make an offer ! 
my cat is simultaneously trying to scratch , lick or peel off all his fur , while bounding from one piece of furniture to the next , now he has squeeze , still scratching , into the small space in my headboard . I think I was a little late for the flea treatment , finally purchased and applied today . 
Ok , everyone send me some positives vibes . Needing the psychic energy . 
what's on my mind : Lots and then again not much . Goodnight < PROPFEMALE > ... 
Into the 6th hour of backing up all my photos , videos and other stuff I can't live without at a prepare for the great leap to Snow Leopard . Jumping right over 10.5 to 10.6 gone make my little tiger < PROPMALE > ( 10.4 ) ROAR ! 
Color the Skies in Ripon if there isn't any wind the hot air balloonist will put on a show . Gotta get up early though . not sure I can make it . 
ok so the little bar that tells me how much of my files have been back up since i started at 8 is maybe 3/8th of an inch filled in with about 4 inches to go ... think it will be done by morning ? I have about a quarter of a million files and 200 GB !!! 
1/6th of an inch to go and the massive back up will be complete . 
woke up to the sound of hot air balloons crossing overhead . Ran out to see them come right over our house and court . neighbors were out too what a great way to start the day ... 
backup is ... done ? actually it's doing \checksum\ " but I don't know for how long ... any ideas ? it's been at it for about an hour now . " 
back up is DONE !!!! > I can breath again . Took over 20 hours but it didn't crash , yeah ! 
lol ! my cat , Little Guy , just BIT through an unopened can of soda and got a face full of fizz !!!!! 
is wondering , now that she is done with her homework , what to do for dinner . Actually , she is wishing the dinner < PROPFEMALE > will come and feed her for she is famished with nothing thawed and ready to cook . 
Volleyball under way -Park View gets a win over Ripon Elementary GO PANTH 
So do you lonw who's behind the awesome educational blogs posting site EDUTOPIA ? check it out ... :) 
Last wall of my bonus room painted - no big deal it's only 22 ft long - sad though probably needs a 2nd coat . Contractor paint doesn't even qualify as a good primer ! 
is excited but trying really hard to down play it . :) !!! it's not working !!!!! can I shout now ! yup , I'm excited .... tell ya later , if I'm still excited . 
merced news - sadness 
Ok . so , I was soooo excited last week ... then I had to spend many days preparing - and now I get to breath .... This morning I had a job interview for a music teaching position ! I think interview went pretty good - so it's wait and see time . 
is tired ... 
TPA brain freeze . and now for an update from Never , Never , land .... doowadittydittydumdittydo .... 10 points to anyone who can guess the song rattling around in my head . 
Ode to Facebook 
office is clean - only 14 more rooms/areas to go ! 
half-a-sigh because I'm half done . TPA #2 is a wrap . back to TPA 1 . \ 
If you are a current teacher smile and say \I'm glad I didn't have to do those ! \"" 
DONE . With the TPA's that is . Now I have to remember what life is like ... let's see pay bills , do the laundry , clean the kitchen . Sheesh ! Is that all there is ? 
I'm really beginning to hate 8th grade - Good luck , < PROPFEMALE > . 
Did anyone catch < PROPFIRST > McCutcheon's \Christmas in the Trenches\ " on Warehouse 13 ? or could I be the only scifi geek in the group ... " 
Well , I delayed looking at my scores for 3 days ... so here goes ... yes ! I passed my first 2 TPA's . It feels so nice to put in so many hours of work just to get a single number back . ;-) 
My nephew < PROPFIRST > had a seizure yesterday and is in the hospital for tests . 
Uncle < PROPMALE > passed away Christmas night . Hugs to all . 
Looking forward to my workshop tomorro .... uh , today . 
While brainstorming my \educational philosophy\ " I happened to write this out ... it made me laugh . \ 
for today ... the most awesomeness thing in the world is a purring cat on my lap .
