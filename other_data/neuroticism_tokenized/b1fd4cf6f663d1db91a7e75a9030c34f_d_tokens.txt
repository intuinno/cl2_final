Red The color of strength , health , and vitality , Red is often the color chosen by someone outgoing , aggressive , vigorous and impulsive—or someone who would like to be ! It goes with an ambitious nature but those who choose it can be abrupt at times , determined to get all they can out of life , quick to judge people and take sides . Red people are usually 
optimistic and can’t stand monotony ; they are rather restless and not at all introspective , so they may be unaware of their own shortcomings . They find it hard to be objective and may blame others for any mishaps . Quiet people with a preference for red may feel the need for the warmth , strength and life-giving qualities of the color , or they blanket their 
true feelings under a sober exterior . Red is usually chosen by people with open and uncomplicated natures , with a zest for life

While you SCREAM at your woman , there's a man wishing he could talk softly to her ear ... While you HUMILIATE , OFFEND and INSULT her , there's a man flirting with her and reminding her how wonderful she is . While you HURT your woman , there's a man wishing he could make love to her . While you make your women CRY there's a ... man stealing smiles from her . Post this on your wall if you're against Domestic Violence ?

. When people look into your eyes , they see mysteries galore . You're a deep and intellectual person , and others can see that through your sparkling eyes . You're quiet and shy , but once you get to know someone , you become comfortable around them . Your eyes often spark curiousity in others , and it bothers people how they can never tell what you're really thinking . You're hard to read and often hide your true emotions . 
has just written a new prose , for reasons , lol
