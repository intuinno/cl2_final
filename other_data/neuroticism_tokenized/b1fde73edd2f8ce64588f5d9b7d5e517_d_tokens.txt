Please put this on your status if you know someone ( or are related to someone ) who is an IDIOT . Idiots affect the lives of many . There is still no known cure for stupidity , but we can raise awareness . 93% wont copy and paste this , many because they're too stupid to know how to copy and paste . Will YOU make this your status for at least one hour ?

People need to understand that children ( and adults ) with special needs don't have an illness , so there is no cure and it's not contagious . They only want what we all want : to be accepted . Will you copy and paste this it and leave it on your status for at least an hour ? It's Special Education week , and this is in honor of all the kids who need a little extra help and understanding 
A weekend to remember & honor ........... 
Patting myself on the back today . All that boring OSHA training & safety training came into play today . I stopped what could of been a nasty accident . I almost didn't say anything because I didn't want to upset the person . But I did the right thing . Would you ? 
GO CELTICS !!!! watchin ' b-ball ........ 
I would of been married 22 years today if a thief called cancer hadn't of stolen our life . Feeling a little weepy & lonely today . Missing what I had & sad for what I won't have in the future . CANCER SUCKS !!!!

Put\ 
this as your status if you know someone who suffers from being a \ 
Michigan Fan . Being a Michigan Fan is a real disorder and should be \ 
taken seriously . There is no known cure for MF and sympathy does NOT \ 
help , but we can raise awareness . 100% of OSU fans will repost this ! \ 
O-H !!! 
< PROPFEMALE > :(

It is Team Member Appreciation Day ! And , yes , I did work in between the feasts ! 
Enough of the pre-printed , pre-addressed Christmas cards ! The pictures are great but I received a card today addressed to\ < PROPFIRST > & < PROPFIRST > Merullo\ " . And it was from a family member to boot !! Are we really too busy to even look at what we are sending out to people . It may of been an oversite but it still hurts like hell . Christmas is hard enough without him . We really didn't need this ! " 
Lost a lot of email addresses . Please email me ... kmerullo@columbus.rr.com . New address 
I remember < PROPFIRST>'s voice , his smile & the silly , high pitched giggle he would do when he laughed really hard . Which made us all laugh even harder ! I will never forget the courage , love & unmatched < PROPFEMALE > my wonderful husband & devoted father showed during his 11 month battle with cancer . We all learned so much from him . Share with us what you remember about < PROPFIRST > . The stories keep his memory alive . XXOO 
How lucky am I to be able to go to work & ask a chef on the best way to cook a T-bone steak I bought for myself & < PROPFIRST > ! I followed her directions & it turned out perfect !! C-bus friends need to utilize all that Market District has to offer . Chefs , a wonderful dietitian & epicureans !! I love my job !! How many of you can say that !!! I'm so blessed .
