2011 is already wonderful !!! I was kissing my wonderful boyfriend of almost 5 years in the rain for the first time . Something I've been dying to do . 

I'm tired ... and I only got a facebook because a friend told me to ... bribed me to ... I don't know why I have one ... I like myspace better 
What's on my mind ?? The fact that I'm getting up in 5 hours and giving other people a bath and getting one from my friend . Also brushing each other's teeth , feeding each other jello , and learning to measure fluid intake and output using catheters .... at 7 in the morning .... my life says yay all over it !! 
is the luckiest person on earth ... being in loive is finding one soul living in two bodies ... and that has indeed been the case for 4 years and 3 days :) 
Sooooooo ... my car has had hiccups for two or three weeks ... just one after another ... it's a car with tertiary infections !!! How does that happen ?!?!?!?!?! 
So I was made aware that when I wear my all white scrubs , I look like I work in an asylum ... and at the end of the day it sort of feels like it ... creepy huh ??? That's how my life is . 
loves watching these kittens grow . It's amazing to see how they all have their own personality , likes and dislikes , and how much they know out of instinct . There is no way anyone can tell me that God made animals devoid of personalities =] ( p.s. my kitten typed this emoticon randomly just by stepping on my keyboard ) LOL 
is stressing out !!! We all got the talk in class today about how we have to step up the pace if we want to succeed in life ... no pressure at all !!! 
is getting ready for clinicals tomorrow . Iget my own patient tomorrow ... 
is a stressed , confused , frazzled , tired , exhausted , exasperated , and will start all over again tomorrow . Going to bed yall . See ya later !! 
I hate paperwork !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Not only does the class have to be super hard and a ton of work but the paperwork comes out of your ears !!! I'd rather buy a car ... less paperwork !! 
Yeah , but it's like 4 years of pain so that you can make money in 4 years . Right now its just like paying them $ 4,000 so that you can work work work work work and still be broke . 
has a question . How many people could take care of a teenager , two kids , a toddler , a dog , and three baby kittens for a day and still write a paper that's due tomorrow ? I can !!! :) 
just finished a 3 < PROPFEMALE > paper :) I'm satisfied at least . 
is adding the final touches to her paperwork and her scholarly paper . Then I get to print and go lawn mowing tomorrow ... yay for money !!!!!! 
Just made $85 in lawn mowing money . $25 goes to < PROPFEMALE > for helping me , $5 went to drinks , $20 goes to my gym membership ( that I don't use ) , $10 for gas for school , and $25 for < PROPMALE > for working on my lawn mower ... end of the day ... $0 richer :) ... anyone need a babysitter or landscaper ? :D 
Done with my evolve case study for class tomorrow ... now I can go to bed and rest for once this week . Later everyone :) 
If you have ever had a crush on me in your life poke me ... like this status if you think im cute ... Inbox me if you ever wanted a relationship ... put a smile if we're friends ... put a heart if you wanna be more than friends ... Now let's see who's brave enough to put this as their status . Cause I'm just this bored ! 
likes swimming ... I need a swimming pool :( I want to swim !!!!!!!!!!!! 1 
is getting ready for a test in pharmacology tomorrow . So I guess I should get offline . \ 
\ 
p.s. .... the fool says in his heart that \there is no God \"..." 
does not like pharm tests but that one was not bad compared to how bad it could have been . Going to get my kid's stuff ready for church tonight :) Later kiddies :) 
got her Pharmacology test results back ... 102% A++ :) Happy happy joy joy !!!!!! 
is tired . Good night world . I've been up since 5 ... and now \I die Horatio\ " LOL " 
I hate not being told anything ... I love to hear what other people plan for me before I know that I'm doing it . 
just got back from a wedding . Congratulations < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > :) I know you will be so happy together :) 
is exhausted . I've been cutting grass and now I am in love with my bed ... got a hot date with my blanket and a hot guy by the name of \pillow\ " ... lol " 
has just left Foundations class . I need to prioritize to study I think . It's all facebook's fault !!!! LOL JK .... Facebook is probably the only reason that I can keep up with what everyone is doing ... cause I definately don't have time to < PROPFEMALE > out with everyone ... anyone ... I have a good case of isolation :) 
needs prayer . Please please please please pray for my classes . I'm scared . It is crunch time and I am apparently not doing as much as I need to to succeed in my classes . Pray that I will have peace of mind during my tests and succeed in all of my classes . 
is so relieved ! Thank you everyone who prayed for me today . Everything went smoothly and I felt so much more confident with my skills than I have felt all summer . God knows what your plans are before you do them ... it's up to you to find out what God's plan is . Keep praying for my classes though . I'm not out of the doghouse just yet . 
Thank you to everyone who has been supportive , understanding , and helpful in my struggle with this class . I have to say from experience that criticism has not been any help at all . As a matter of fact it makes me despondent . My mind shuts down and I give up . So thank you for the music people . 
I am not doing well at all . My first car accident to add to all the trouble . I stink at life . I quit . 
For everyone who was wondering . I am ok . I am just being tested this summer . I firmly believe that God is trying me , testing me , and trying to improve me ... I am a house under construction , sometimes you have to destroy some walls so you can put up new ones 
is on summer break now !!! YAY !!! A whole week !!! :)))) I miss my man right now . He's in Ohio ... without me ... ( sniffles ) Talk about emotional whiplash :) LOL 
You know you're a nursing student when you find a dollar in the parking lot and scream , \Ahhhhhh !!! Jesus wants me to have this dollar !!! \ " LOL ( me and < PROPFEMALE > last month ) :) ROFL !!! " 
just put up and album . I made and album of some of my friends and their celebrity look-a-likes . :) Enjoy everybody !! 
just got done swimming :) Brooklyn and < PROPFEMALE > Henson throw the best pool parties !!!!!!!!!!! 
I am in love with the most handsom man alive , who is my best friend , who is the most incredible man in the world , who is also the everything I could ever want :) I love you < PROPMALE > :) 
I am in love with the\

Just saw Eclipse ... It was phenomenal !!! It was action packed , dramatic , and it was relatively accurate to the book ... a few scenes they butchered but overall it had the thrill , suspense , and action type feel that the book had ... way to go director < PROPFIRST > Slade !!! 
finished clinicals today ... feel so relieved . I slept for 4 hours .... that's exhaustion 
waiting for my professional development class to start . Then I'm going to clean up a hedge for one of my customers . Today is so much easier than yesterday :) 
Soooo .... I heard an interesting tidbit about my school ... apparently BCHS is responsible for the most nursing students that report to the psychiatric < PROPMALE > in the hospital each year ... not surprising ... but not encouraging either lol 
Yay !!!!! Free !!!!!!.... for the weekend at least :) 
Hey what's that on the ceiling . It looks like a green bean ! :) - < PROPFEMALE > Osborn 
In Alabama for my cousin < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE>'s wedding ... :) 
Missing a very special someone right now :( 
needs prayer for finals . I would appreciate as many prayers as I can get . I am a shell of a person since these summer classes have started and I hear it will only get worse . Please pray that I pass all my classes . I am a little worried about them . 
Today was my last clinical day until September :) I am sooooooooooo relieved !!! I feel liberated . 
is going to return demonstrate catheters and NG tube application and removal ... last day of clinicals !!!! yay !!! 
I need prayer . I rocked my catheter and NG tube demonstrations but I still need prayer . Thanks guys 
So I went to wal-mart yesterday ... watched the puffer fish ... cause I want one ... and listened to two 11 year old kids who told me about their aquariums at home ... it was very enlightening 
It's sad when a cold front comes through and the temperature is still in the 90's - < PROPFEMALE >
