Please\ 
put this on your status if you know or love someone who is gay . My wish\ 
for 2010 is that people will understand that being gay is not a disease\ 
nor a choice - people who are gay are not looking for a cure , but \ 
acceptance and equal rights ... Most won't copy and paste this . Will you ? \ 
Make it ...... your status for at least 1 hour ? ? Promote LOVE & \ 
Acceptance , not hate !

Am I gonna be baking this weekend ...? hmmm ... I wonder ... 
Will the rain ever stop , I wonder ? For a pretty long time now it’s been cold . Why does the rain chooses to fall on me ? Why does it chooses me who has nowhere to escape to ? I guess thats what I get for trying to be a good friend ... well I'm over it ... from now on only gonna look out for myself . 
Nobody knows what the truth and future are so the answer is here , always in your heart . Burn the world , know the mind tomorrow ; Believe in your heart !

Please copy and paste this into your status if you know someone , or have been affected by someone , who needs a punch in the face . People who need a punch in the face affect the lives of many . There is still no known cure for people who need a punch in the face , except a punch in the face . 93% of people won't re-post this ... Why ? Because they probably need a punch in the face . 
Need help ! Does anyone know a good class I can add at this point ? xD I wanna drop one class cuz it looks annoying , but I dont wanna drop below 4 classes . If you have any suggestions let me know : x
