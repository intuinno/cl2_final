Question of the Day : What's the difference between a < PROPMALE > and his horse ? ( Hint : It's not the obvious answer !! ) 

Ich will , dass ihr mir vertraut . Ich will dass ihr mir glaubt . Ich will eure Blicke spurn . Jeden herzschlag kontrollieren ! 
Chilling , can't wait for the snow , kind of bored . 
The worst is coming , maybe no school tomorrow , I'll have to sacrifice a goat to make it happen ... 
Saw the Wolfman last night , awesome movie , bout damn time Weres got some screen , I've had enough of vamps for one mcinematic lifetime ... 
No school ! Absolutely awesome ! I was gonna cut anyway , but now it's legit ... 
What makes a man ? Is it his dreams and drives that send his heart to the farthest edges of imagination . Is it the women of his life , the unearthly beauties that make his heart soar or tear his dreams asunder ? What makes a man , is truly , his drive , his stubborn refusal to listen to the odds , his soul's call to arms and his body's demand to bring his life to its mighty zenith , to realize his full potential ... 
Snowpocolypse ! Snowmeggedon ! Snowtorious B.I.G. ! it's pretty bad out there ... I'm pretty much stuck at home all weekend long , I hope everybody else there is having a little more fun ... 
Lesbian kisses make me smile ... 
I've got you under my skin . \ 
I've got you deep in the heart of me . \ 
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me . \

With my freeze ray\ 
\ 
I will find the time to ... \ 
Find the words to ... \ 
Tell you how ... \ 
How you make ... \ 
Make me feel ... \ 
What's the phrase ? \ 
Like a fool ... \ 
Kind of sick ... \ 
Special needs ... \ 
Anyways ... \ 
--- Dr. Horrible 
O Death\ 
Won't you spare me another year ? \ 
But what is this I can't see\ 
With ice cold hands taking hold of me ? \ 
When God is gone and the devil takes hold\ 
Who'll have mercy on your soul ? \ 
No wealth , no ruin , no silver , no gold\ 
Nothing satisfies me but your soul . \ 
Well , I am Death no one can excel\ 
I'll open the door to Heaven or Hell\ 
My name is Death and the end is here ... 
Free at last ! \ 
Thank god almighty , free at last ! 
\Take that Jesus ! \ 
It turns to silence , a silence sometimes I can hear 
I'm one part saint and two parts sinner and the last part is still on the line 
24hrs without sleep , let's see if I can go for 48 ! 
12hrs . of ome of the best sleep of my life , I'm up and at ' um , ready to start another bland day , just waiting till tomorrow . 
Throw away my dreams\ 
This fight for my life\ 
Isn't dead and behind me\ 
And I've been told to scream\ 
When no one can hear me it doesn't mean nothing ... \ 
So make me believe\ 
Just take me away from this hell I've created\ 
And I'm afraid\ 
I'm breaking my own vows\ 
Knowin ' I'll go down in flames \ 
-Godsmack 
found the other half of my self 
I really don't want to make a big deal about graduating , can I just get my diploma and < PROPFEMALE > wit my buds ? 
\Finally recover when the mood is right\ 
I'm going in for the kill\ 
I'm doing it for the thrill\ 
Oh , I'm hoping you'll understand\ 
And not let go of my hand 
My skin feels like it is on fire , damn the sun ! Damn it straight to hell ! 
What you give , is what you take\ 
What you bleed , is what you break\ 
I'll bleed for you\ 
I'd steal for you\ 
I'd take\ 
Right in my sight , keep it through the night\ 
I'll smash right through your spotlight 
Steal a soul for a second chance\ 
But you will never become a man\ 
My chosen torture makes me stronger\ 
In a life that craves the hunger\ 
A freedom and a quest for life\ 
Until the end of judgement night 
God , I'm peeling like a goddamned snake . Anybody want any < PROPFIRST > jerky ? 
Hey , I'm your life\ 
I'm the one who takes you there\ 
I'm the one who cares\ 
They , they betray\ 
I'm your only true friend now\ 
They , they'll betray\ 
I'm forever there\ 
I'm your dream , make you real\ 
I'm your eyes when you must steal\ 
I'm your pain when you can't feel\ 
Sad but true\ 
Hate , I'm your hate\ 
I'm your hate when you want love\ 
Pay , pay the price\ 
Pay for nothing's fair 
Say his name and mine in the same breath\ 
I dare you to say they taste the same\ 
Let the leaves fall off in the summer\ 
And let December glow in flames\ 
Take a < PROPMALE > let your body get a tolerance\ 
I'm not a < PROPMALE > put a heat wave in your pants\ 
Pull a breath like another cigarette\ 
Pawnshop heart trading up 
And I'd give up forever to touch you\ 
Cause ' I know that you feel me somehow\ 
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be\ 
And I don't want to go home right now\ 
And all I can taste is this moment\ 
And all I can breathe is your life\ 
' Cause sooner or later it's over\ 
I just don't want to miss you tonight 
We live in a cold dark world with venom in it's fangs . \ 
You can spit it in my face but I know I'll be ok\ 
It's on the attack . It's a war , It's a game . \ 
A ball and chain chew my arm off to get away\ 
Don't fight , or it deny it , invite it cause when it\ 
Feels like a kick in the teeth , I can take it . \ 
Throw your stones and you won't see me break it . \ 
Say what you want , take your shots . 
I gotta say thanks cause you kick me when I'm down\ 
I'm bleeding out the mouth . \ 
I hope you know I'm stronger now . \ 
I'm taking the hate , I'm turning it all around . \ 
I won't go down ' til I'm six feet underground . 
Company , always on the run\ 
< PROPFEMALE > , it's the rising sun\ 
I was born a shotgun in my hand\ 
Behind the gun , I'll make my final stand\ 
Yeah , that's why they call me\ 
Bad company , I can't deny\ 
Bad , bad company\ 
Till the day I die 
I got a concussion !! Yea head injuries !! 
I'm the man , I'm the king\ 
I'm the one that's pure inside\ 
Every day , every way , I smell of suicide\ 
Bitter sins how they grow within\ 
So tell me it ain't right\ 
I am all sins\ 
And you're my reason for life 
Die , die , die my darling\ 
Don't utter a single word\ 
Just shut your pretty eyes\ 
I'll be seeing you again\ 
I'll be seeing you in Hell 
Though my soul may set in darkness , it will rise in perfect light 
Welcome to where time stands still\ 
No one leaves and no one will\ 
< PROPFEMALE > is full , never seems to change\ 
Just labeled \mentally deranged\ " \ 
Sleep my friend and you will see\ 
That dream is my reality\ 
They keep me locked in this cage\ 
Can't they see it's why my brain says rage\ 
Build my fear of what's out there\ 
And cannot breathe the open air\ 
Whisper things into my brain\ 
Assuring me that I'm insane\ 
They think our heads are in their hands\ 
But violent use brings violent plans\ 
Keep him tied , it makes him well\ 
He's getting better , can't you tell ? 
I don't want to be the one\ 
The battles always choose\ 
Cause inside I realize\ 
That I'm the one confused 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5St9phiHHE 
I'm growing so disturbed\ 
Nothing makes sense to me anymore\ 
I'm learning to resist\ 
Becoming more than you ever were\ 
Can't explain , what's come over me , come over me\ 
Can't explain , why it's so hard for me , \ 
So hard to see your side . 
I'm becoming less defined as the days go by\ 
Fading away , well you might say , I'm losing focus\ 
Kind of drifting into the abstract in terms of how I see myself\ 
Sometimes , I think I can see right through myself\ 
Less concerned about fitting into the world , \ 
Your world that is , cause it doesn't really matter anymore 
The more I stay in here\ 
The more it's not so clear\ 
The more I disappear\ 
As far as I have gone\ 
I knew what side I'm on\ 
But now I'm not so sure\ 
The line begins to blur 
She turns me on , \ 
She makes it real . \ 
I have to apologize\ 
For the way I feel\ 
And nothing can stop me now -\ 
There's nothing to fear , \ 
And everything that ever was\ 
Is inside of here . 
Yes , I am alone but then again I always was\ 
As far back as I can tell\ 
I think maybe it's because\ 
Because you were never really real to begin with\ 
I just made you up to hurt myself\ 
And it worked . \ 
Yes it did ! 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone . \ 
It's not warm when she's away . \ 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone \ 
And she's always gone too long anytime she goes away . \ 
Hey , I ought to leave the young thing alone , \ 
But ain't no sunshine when she's gone , only darkness everyday . \ 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone , \ 
And this house just ain't no home anytime she goes away . 
Fight\ 
Not to fail\ 
Not to fall\ 
Or you'll end up like the others\ 
Die\ 
Die again\ 
Drenched in sin\ 
With no respect for another\ 
OH ! \ 
Down \ 
feel the fire\ 
Feel the hate\ 
Your pain is what we desire\ 
Lost \ 
hit the wall\ 
Watch you crawl\ 
Such a replaceable liar 
It comes down to this . \ 
Your kiss . \ 
Your fist . \ 
And your strain . \ 
It get's under my skin . \ 
Within . \ 
Take in the extent of my sin\ 
You give me the anger . \ 
You give me the nerve . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > out my sentence . \ 
While I get what I deserve . \ 
I'm just an effigy to be disgraced . \ 
To be defaced . \ 
Your need for me has been replaced . \ 
And if I can't have everything well then just give me a taste . 
Talking to myself all the way to the station\ 
Pictures in my head of the final destination\ 
All lined up , all the ones that aren't allowed to stay\ 
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away\ 
Tried to save a place from the cuts and the scratches\ 
Tried to overcome my complications and my catches\ 
Nothin ' ever grows and the sun doesn't shine all day\ 
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away 
The more that we take\ 
The paler we get\ 
I can’t remember what it is\ 
We try to forget\ 
The tile on the floor\ 
So cold it could sting\ 
In your eyes is a place\ 
Worth remembering\ 
For you to go and take this\ 
And smash it apart\ 
I’ve gone all this fucking way\ 
To wind up back at back at the start\ 
The closer we think we are\ 
Well , it only got us so far\ 
Now you’ve got anything left to show ? \ 
No , no I didn’t think so . 
Am I \ 
Am I still tough enough ? \ 
Feels like I'm wearing down \ 
Is my viciousness losing ground\ 
Am I taking too much ? \ 
Did I cross the line ? \ 
I need my role in this \ 
Very clearly defined \ 
I need your discipline \ 
I need your help \ 
You know once I start I cannot help myself 
The paranoia is in bloom , the PR\ 
Transmissions will resume , they'll try to\ 
Push drugs , keep us all dumb down and hope that\ 
We will never see the truth around , so come on\ 
Another promise , another scene , another\ 
Package not to keep us trapped in greed with all the\ 
Green belts wrapped around our minds and endless\ 
Red tape to keep the truth confined , so come on 
Waiting till the minute the clock rolls over to 12:01 on Halloween night , gonna start the NaNoWriMo contest the moment it starts and i won't stop till the sun comes up ! 
Counting down the hours , the NaNo is almost here , only about 9 and a half hours to go ..... sigh , wish i could control time ....... 
Starting the NaNo in one minute ...... 
Yay !! I just finished my first day's word count only about two and a half hours after the start of the contest ! Off to a great start , everything else is just extra filler ! 
Day two is all done ! My word count is 2124 ! Very happy , let's hope I can keep up this pace and maybe I'll be done around the 27th 
Are you ugly ? \ 
A liar like me ? \ 
A user , a lost soul ? \ 
Someone you don’t know\ 
Money it’s no cure\ 
A Sickness so pure\ 
Are you like me ? \ 
Are you ugly ? 
Nobody expect me to be social for the next couple of days , at least not until this tuesday . I've got about 12000 words to write over the next four days to win the NaNoWriMo and I've got work over the next few days , I will return , don't miss me too much . 
YESSSSSS ! VICTORY IS MINE !!! 50066 WORDS !! MY FIRST DAMNED NANOWRIMO AND I WIN IT !!! Whew .... glad to get that out of my system . Now , the easy part will be the wait followed by the eventual editing . To all my fellow NaNo-ers , good luck finishing and congrats if you already did . To everybody that offered their support , thank you so much ! 
If there was no tomorrow\ 
would you still remain the same\ 
or live your life , so shallow\ 
and take it for granted everyday\ 
So take away tomorrow\ 
and tell me again why we blame\ 
why we waste all our time\ 
with bullshit and pride\ 
time may not wait another day

You know I'm carrying with me\ 
Over twenty years of pity\ 
My whole personality\ 
Was formed by others , not me ! \ 
When I look back on my life\ 
One that's always filled with strife\ 
I rode down a bad course\ 
Nobody's fault but yours ! 
You'd never know it\ 
But < PROPMALE > I'm a kind of poet\ 
And I've got a lot of things , I wanna say 
Thank you all for your posts , ya'll brought a smile to my face on an otherwise bland birthday . Thank you all ! 
I can feel the animal inside\ 
My resolve is weakening\ 
Pounding on the doors of my mind\ 
It's nearly overpowering\ 
I cannot begin to describe\ 
The hunger that I feel again\ 
Run if you intend to survive\ 
For the beast is coming to life 
I cannot wait for Dead Space 2 , it looks freakin ' badass ! 
Asking if everyone could please put this as your status for 1hr . if U or someone U know has/had cancer . My prayer is that in 2011 a cure will be found . Will U post it for just one hour ? Do it for all of us ! 
Got Dead Space 2 yesterday , played it around midnight , with the lights off and headphones on , gotta say , this is one of the greatest games I have ever played , not to mention one of the scariest . I'm so glad I don't have work until sunday , I'm probably going to be up most of the next couple of days at 3am playing it when my family is gone . Amazing game ... 
I was never the kind\ 
To be taking my time\ 
Any place that's worth a damn\ 
And today's another day\ 
That I've gone and thrown away\ 
And I don't care where it lands\ 
' Cause I'm just thinking about us\ 
I've been living in a dream about you\ 
And now I know you were all I ever wanted on my mind\ 
And if I never see\ 
My own reality\ 
Well , I'm okay to leave it all behind

What is lost can never be saved 
I am no Superman \ 
I have no reasons for you \ 
I am no hero \ 
Oh , that’s for sure 
So , I've reinstated myself as a full-fledged nerd after taking over an hour to build up an awesome collection of songs for playing D&D to .... and I'm okay with that :) 
I guess I'm pretty much a lone wolf . I don't say I don't like people at all , but , to tell you the truth , I only like it then if I have a < PROPMALE > to look deep into their hearts and their minds . --- Bela Lugosi 
Another restless night of nightmares ... I'm beginning to be a little worried . Hopefully , I'll stop having them and be able to get some real sleep soon , maybe 
I'm a walking cliche , but you know you love me for it . I'm all the stronger for it , and I'm only gonna get stronger ! 
So , yeah , very tired , I can't wait to enjoy the two days I have off . Next week is gonna be insane , I work 36 hours ... I'm gonna hate myself , until I get that paycheck at least 
You might be a nerd when you get chills from a game breaking combo you just thought up for Magic Online ..... 
You know , I just realized something .... It's really hard to crack down and write a novel ....

I think this is going to be the opening for my current WIP , seems to fit the character perfectly . 
I'm so very , very tired ...... 
So , I just watched How to Train your Dragon , with my family , and I have to say , the movie was amazingly awesome . The dragons were awesome , the voice actors were just perfect , and there was plenty of darkness in it that I totally didn't expect . The coolest part ? < PROPMALE > Butler as a viking !!! 
You and I end up in a police car together : Using only 4 words , what would you say to me ? Note : if you comment you must copy and paste this as your status , so I may comment on yours as well . Be a good sport and play along ... 4 words are harder than you think 
If I died tomorrow , what one thing would you want me to know ?
