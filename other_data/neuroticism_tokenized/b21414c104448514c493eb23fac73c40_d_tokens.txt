Happy New Year to my Facebook friends & family !! May you have a Wonderful & Blessed New Year . 
I finally got my computer to work without locking up . I haven't been on Facebook in a while . It worked for a while last night and then locked up again . I think I need a new computer . Anyhow , I am a month late but , thank you for all the birthday wishes . I really do appreciate my Facebook family . Birthdays are kinda bittersweet since I lost < PROPFIRST > , its just different without him being here . 
Ok so I talk too much , had to split the last message into 2 because I went over the status update limit . I'll have to work on that :~) . 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas to my FaceBook family & friends
