Some say the simple things in life are for the simple minded . I say , if you don't appreciate the simple joys of life , you will never fully appreciate anything . 
Your smile means more than you know . It is a cherished and never fading gift , even in the darkest of times .

Mr President , I hear you would like to freeze pay rates for military starting next year . Would you also consider cutting your own pay to save more money for our country ? While you're at it , lets cut down congressmen's pay , too . If the people who risk their lives don't get an increase in pay , why would we continue raising pay for those who take no risks and reap the benefits ? Keep this going if you agree ...... 
It's beginning to feel a lot like Christmas . 
Too much mental energy . I have a feeling I'm going to be up late tonight :/ 
Headed to CPAC in DC ! 
At the < PROPFEMALE > Forum about to see < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST >

CPAC with Young Americans for < PROPFEMALE > - East < PROPFEMALE > University Chapter was awesome and < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > won the straw poll once again ! Hopefully big government Republicans and Democrats get the message before it's too late . 
Right next to my bed is \GIVE US LIBETY\ " A Tea Party Manifesto lol I guess my dad was reading it and now I may too haha "

My parents new computer is awsome ! I've never been on a computer with a quad core ... It is super fast .

Reveling in Obama's economic approval rating consistently going down :) Capitalism and smaller government works , stimulus spending and debt do not . 
I drink energy drinks to stay awake and get things done but it seems that all it does is make my mind go in even more directions ... garsh .

A book of words and make believe runs you around ten bucks . Best friends are priceless .

When someone threatens you it is just time to walk away and get them out of your life . 
Brilliant ideas are a thought away . 
Me+3 WI classes is just a disaster . ECU is not playing to my strengths this semester .
