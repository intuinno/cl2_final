I tried sushi before the New Year ... 

HAPPY NEW YEAR ! 2011 ! 
I'm so happy I got a Facebook ! 
AHHHHH ! I'm 13 now ! It feels so wierd ! 
Too much homework !! 
I was so happy to see Jarraka ! 
So tired ! :( 
So upset and frustrated ! :( 
Going to Milwaukee ! Hope everyone has a good day ! :) 
Hopefully we have a snowday tomorrow I have so much homework to catch up on ! :) cross your fingers 
Finally another snow day ! :) SO HAPPY !!! 
So sad :( but happy at the same time , for a different reason ! 
the dance was so fun !!!! :D 
Going to Marquette !!! :) See everyone later 
I'm finally home !!! After 750 < PROPMALE > of riding in the car !!!! :) 
Such a flashback !! My dad is recording Magic School Bus for some friends in Marquette ! :) 
Upset ...................... 
So glad it's the weekend ! This horrible week kept dragging on and on ........ 
Just fell in a chair and fliped backward .... random :) 
Going 2 Janesville , getting a new hamster ............. any suggestions on names !! :) 
Just had an almost perfect day .... i loved it !!! :) 
No School !!! But of course my luck I'm sick . 
The end of a perfect day !!! I just hope tomorrow can be as amazing as today was !! :) 
Out of the blue all the water in our house is yellow ... we don't know what it is . I have horrible luck again and of course my mom was doing the laundry with my white church clothes in the wash when everything turned yellow . :( 
YAY !!! :) We got a new well but we can't use the water yet !! :( 
Going 2 a friend's house then going 2 see a movie ........ can't wait !!!! :) 
< PROPFIRST > , I'm sorry I was tired but you didn't have to put whipped cream on my face !!!! 
Had a pretty good day ! I love the weather so much right now ... it feels so good ! :) Excited to see < PROPFEMALE > soon less than 5 days !! SO HAPPY :) 
I had an amazing and funny day ! :) I hope S&E goes well ! Excited to see < PROPFEMALE > in less than 3 days ! :D 
Such a wierd and wonderful day ! :) Solo and Ensemble went great .. got a gold ! Right before S&E my dad tried to hold my hamster and he jumped on the floor for a few hours and we found him later , with a pile of food under a cabinet . Then I was running in the halls of school ( I know bad choice ) and a door opened and I smashed into it not seeing it and my arm still hurts to move it ..... altogether it turned out ok ! :D 
My arm/wrist still hurts extremly bad from yesterday ... :( i hope it gets better ! The wierd thing is < PROPMALE > hurt his wrist yesterday too ! 
My arm is still hurting so bad ... i don't know if its just a bruise or something worse anyway an ok day but the weather was amazing and getting to see < PROPFEMALE > and making so cookies !!! :) 
Ok my arm isn't broken or anything like that ... so I'm glad but what I do have could be painful for another month and last for six months 
the one time i forget to put the top on the blender when i was making a smoothie it sprays all over me and the kitchen ... wow :) 
Its feels good today , the feeling where everything is right with the world ... :) 
Nervous , after a long and fun spring break , for the it to pass ... I hope it does or Brodhead could loose a lot :( 
oh no it didn't pass ... what will happen now :( 
I feeling like everyone is against me ... even if I know it is not true :( 
Is tastee creme really open ?? 
It's just one of those weeks where it already should be friday ... and one of those days you just wanna hide because you feel so lost ... 
What a day at a wedding my dad is taking wedding pictures and the bridal party is so funny .... and txting somebody ... :) 
Wow track was so funny ... i so epically failed on hurdles and < PROPFIRST > Long beat me because i tripped 4 times on only a few hurdles , it was a great way to end practice , and i kept going the wrong way on high jump even though i cleared it perfectly the first times today but idk y ... and i was drinking water from < PROPFIRST>'s water bottle and she decided to tip it on my face and dump it down my face and back LOL !!! :D 
Ok i am happy about track cause i cleared opening jump ... oh yeah ... but i am so mad right now becuase all of a sudden i wanted to take a picture and my camera screen is broken from the inside .... grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr !!!!!! :( 
Wow i knew it was a bad day but one foot out of place on the track hurts so bad .... and i had to ride my bike home with cuts on both my arms and legs OWWWWW !!!!! :( but thanks Harli for helping me when i fell :) 
is excited for the dance :) but my legs and arm still sting like crazy :( 
I honestly think today was the best day ever - so much friend time , no classes in school , mr. urness taped to the blechers , mr. young giving a makeover , and of course the dance i think i danced to whole time with all my friends ... I LOVED TODAY !!!!! even though my knee still hurts like crazy :D 
Fun day with Jarraka and with Klaudia for some time ... then 2 the Grand March for prom :) 
I wanted to say HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my awesome sister < PROPFEMALE > Schoeller and that I love you soooooooooo much :D 
So stressed about the indian project ............ AGGGGGGGGHHHHHHH 
The mile tomorrow and the project due ... just have to get past that and i get to go camping , canoeing ( if i don't fall out again ) , archery , horseback riding .......... can't wait 
Can't wait for camp today ... hope i don't get hurt even more than i already am ... or tip over the canoe !!! :D 
I loved camp :) ... I would go again anytime ... cept for the food and no camp fire ... :( 
The weather is great ... and i have nothing to do cause i can't leave the house .... grrrrrrrrrrrrrr
