1\ 
of every 10 people born is gay . That means 1 of every 10 people is \ 
instantly put down , given bad labels , left alone , put in a minority , and\ 
so much else , all for something they didn't ask for . Many gay teens are\ 
going to suicide as a way of escaping . If you want to tell them life \ 
... will get better and you respect them ... for who they are , copy and \ 
paste this . Most of you won't , but let's see the 5% who will . 
Don't cry , I know you're trying the hardest and the hardest part is letting go . 
I wanna see my sister . :/ 
Dear Homework-\ 
Can you please answer your own questions for once ? \ 
-Love < PROPFEMALE > . 
Ugh , can't wait to get these spacers out tomorrow . 
I wish I could chew :/\ 
And I wish it didn't take me 10 minutes to eat one chip . 
I love That 70's Show :) 
Chocolate pudding :) <3 
I miss you . 
Thinking I might watch Finding Nemo , then bed . Probably not going to school tomorrow . 
Every\ 
person has 1000 wishes , a cancer patient only has one : to get better . I\ 
know that 97% won't post this as their status - be one of the 3% and \ 
post this as your status . Do it for at least an hour , for those who have\ 
died of cancer or who are still fighting . 
Braces are sooo awesome ! 
Ouuch . I now know why I shouldn't have solid food . Or food that needs chewing . :/ 
Dear Brownie-\ 
I wish I could eat you . \ 
Love , me . 
These brownies are mocking me . 
Sometimes I miss my long hair . :/ 
I wish facebook wasn't being retarded and would actually let me read my comments . 
So don't forget to smile when you see the sun come out , Cuz your laughter and your love are all I've been thinking about . Just the thought of you sustains me and that smile of yours could make the whole world new . I love the way I feel when I'm with you . <3 
I hate essays . 
< PROPFEMALE > Viens should hurry up with my pie . I'm hungry :)

I am going to break my brother's phone if he doesn't stop playing Dynamite . -_- 
Already dreading going to school tomorrow .. 
I wish I could freaking concentrate ... 
Cuz these are the nights that you know when you're there , you couldn't have planned it much better I swear , and you hope that your senses aren't failing you now . And you think to yourself , now I could be wrong . But I might have just stolen this scene from a song and you know that your senses aren't failing you now , but they're slipping away . <3 
Dress rehearsal 
So I'm sitting in the car all pshyc'd thinking Video Killed The Radio < PROPFEMALE > was on , and it ends up being some stupid crap . -_-

Laziness runs in the family .

Why is the cat yellow ???? 
Never will I ever use just plain google ever again 
Sometimes I wish you would just tell the truth . Sometimes I wish this didn't bother me . :/ 
You think killing people would make them like you ? Well it doesn't , it doesn't . I just makes them dead . 
Home now . :) So excited that I got to see the LaPorte's today :D HOAHSDFLHASDJKFHIUWHAFEJKHJHAFS

New carpet + theater kids = let your imagination run wild 
Long as you keep them way off balance , how can they spot you got no talent ? 
I hope I can sleep tonight ... 
Should probably find something pretty to wear to the < PROPFEMALE > Tea Party :D 
I think my cat's trying to get on top of my door .... 
Well , she got on top of the door .. 
So ready for bed 
I hate when you're sick at night , so you go to the bathroom , and as soon as you get into the bathroom you feel fine , and then feel sick again after you leave . 
Crazy idea , but MAYBE it would make a little bit of sense if you don't make a certain type of phone that I ordered , MAYBE you could call or e-mail saying that instead of sending me the wrong phone AGAIN . Just a thought . 
How come everyone says something about < PROPFIRST > Beiber sounding like a girl but no one ever says anything about that guy that sings Rocketeir sounding like a girl ? HMMMMMM 
Tea party :) 
\Can I borrow your dinglehopper ? \"" 
i wish i was able to take naps ..

I'm starting to think that my brother actually likes not having his DSi 
Honestly , my friends pretty much suck . 
The end of Nanny McPhee gets me every time :'( 
The plus side of having no friends : Watching movies without being interrupted and getting enough sleep .

It's what you wear from ear to ear and not from head to toe that matters :) 
I know this sounds really bad , but no , I am not wearing any specific color to support wreakless driving . 
24 days :) 
I feel so lost not having rehearsal ... 
Banana 
Why does my cat insist on sitting on my homework 
I like to play A Spoonful of Sugar when I clean my room so it feels like something's actually getting done :) 
I would totally get dreds if I they were easier to get out .. 
You think killing people will make them like you , but it doesn't , It just makes them dead . 
-___- This is cooool . 
Holy autotuned voice , < PROPFIRST > beiber beat , and bad lyrics . \ 
Why I ever decided I wanted to hear Friday , I'll never know .. 
I like how I'm always , ALWAYS there when you have something to talk about , but as soon as I have something that I want to talk to someone about it's always \my phone's dead\ " or \ " I have to go\ " \ 
* < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > kisses < PROPMALE > ss aroura * little boy in audience EWWWWWWWW 
Last show went great . \
