Should have taken summer classes . : < 

The television was blaring and rolling its screen like it was frustrated that nobody would watch it . 
Is home ! 
Thanks for the birthday wishes , all :) 
Twenty-Eleven or Two-thousand-eleven ? Either way , Happy New Year 
Happy Pi Day ! 
32 days ! 
Oh .. it's April . 
So , what's this zombie thing going on around campus and why haven't I heard about it until I saw people with NERF guns being chased after/attacked by zombies ? : < 
Is very disappointed in the Housing Department . Looking for as many ways as possible to write complaints , to as many people possible . 
What's the point of being rebellious when you come back to find permission granted ? Anyway , <3 Chinchilla . 
started using CourseRank to find classes ( http://ufl.courserank.com ) 
hm .. four hours left to write the other half of the essay . But there's nothing else to write . :/ 
doesn't want to study . 
7:30 AM is an obnoxious time to schedule a final . 
is rewatching < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Hakusho ~ 
Tea ! <3 
can't sleep : < 
So , the day after I send an e-mail asking when < PROPMALE > money will be disbursed I get an e-mail back saying that I don't have that < PROPMALE > on my award file .. and find that it disappeared from my awards/distributions list online . Guess who didn't print out a hard copy before this odd coincidence ? FML . 
All this excitemet about Lost almost makes me regret never showing any interest . Just almost . 
Has found Narnia and closed it off so it's not a hiding spot for the chinchilla anymore . 
rainrainrain . Ew . 
Nice perfume . Must you marinate in it ? 
Roomie fell in the laundry room . Something broke and now my room is being flooded :/ 
Running on less than four hours of sleep . : < 
There is now a vuvuzela button on youtube . Just to add in the sound of the World Cup to everything you watch online as well . :) 
Cause even for an Easy Girl you're moving kinda fast . 
What if my talent has been overrated ? \ 
What if I simply don't have what it takes ? \ 
What if my promise has already faded\ 
How can I afford to lose at these stakes ? 
should be studying for finals . Key word : Should . 
2 hours until physics 2 final ... Then packing time . 
Well , this week is going to suck . 
doesn't think a student should be able to understand and explain a lab better than the < PROPFEMALE > does . 
Funny how much more sense everything makes after actually reading the textbook . I should have done this weeks ago . 
wants to go back to sleep . 
has Skype ! sophia . ricoarango 
is wondering whether people are actually being truthful or just trying to think of the dirtiest innuendo possible to make . As much as I would like to join in , I'd rather just be blunt about it and say that yeah , Breast Cancer is very real and we need to be aware of it/do research/etc . 
\The significant problems we face today cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them . \"" 
is a straight ally and National Coming Out Day is tomorrow . I'm coming out for lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender equality because it's 2010 and only five states plus DC recognize that love , not gender , is what matters in a marriage .

“Remember , remember , the fifth of November , the gunpowder treason and plot . I know of no reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot . \ " , 2010-11-05 05:45:26 " 
Oh ? No classes on the 11th ? Best news all week ! 
Go to Google Maps , then click Get Directions . Put Japan as the start and USA as the end . Read steps 27 and 38 . 
A female Dr. Frankenfurter ? No thanks , Glee . Don't think I'm going to even bother trying to watch this show after that :/ 
Occasionally , I'll bit into a Tomato to remind myself of why I don't like them . \ 
Well , tonight I did just that , and it's just as putrid as it has always been . 
Can't sleep . 
Happy Thanksgiving :) 
D: Traffic was horrible . 
Thanks for the Birthday Wishes !! 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas ~ ! <3 
I want to play the Silent Hill games , though the only one I own is The Room and I don't even have that at the apartment :/\ 
Time to check if Gamestop has any of them >>
