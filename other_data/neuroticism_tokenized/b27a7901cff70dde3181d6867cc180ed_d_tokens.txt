First day at Kroger , this week is gonna be ridiculous 
never been so tired in my life 
It is easy to forget about the downtrodden , those less fortunate than yourself . That is , of course , until you see a single working mother try not to cry in line at kroger because she doesnt have enough money to buy her < PROPFEMALE > girl milk . I wonder if my mother went through the same scenario ? It was a reality check to be sure , quite sobering , and my powerlessness to aid her nearly broke my heart . 
feels fly like a cheese stick 
I throw my sandwhich in the air sometimes 
Dark Gadget build got netdecked by a writer , and found success . pretty proud of myself XD

PLEASE - put this on your status if you know someone ( or are related to someone ) who has been eaten by dragons . Dragons are nearly unstoppable and , in case you didn't know , they can also breathe fire . 93% of people won't copy and paste this , because they have already been eaten by dragons . 6% of people are sitting in the shower armed with fire extinguishers & the remaining 1% are awesome and will repost this . 
Fact : < PROPMALE > Barker trained in Karate with < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE >

Wishes he could go to the < PROPMALE > regionals tomorrow :( 
First Regionals went amazing , qualified for nats , finished 18 out of we over 300 , and made some pretty sweet trades . Thanks to < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > for bringing me along 
I like how they still let < PROPMALE > cage make movies ... 
Very good day 
Disaster , when viewed from a different perspective , often reveals opportunity
