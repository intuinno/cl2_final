The lender then sold the < PROPFEMALE > immediately to an investor at a discount of 4-1/2 percent and received $ 35,800 . What was the original < PROPFEMALE > amount ? 
Now here is a Question !! < PROPMALE > purchased a home for $ 82,500 . first trust deed from bank was 80% of the purchase price and deposit was $ 1,800 . In a separate transaction , he sold a $ 9,600 trust deed for a 30% discount and applied the proceeds to the purchase price . If the seller will < PROPFEMALE > a second trust deed for the balance of the purchase price , what will be the amount of the second trust deed carried by the owner ?
