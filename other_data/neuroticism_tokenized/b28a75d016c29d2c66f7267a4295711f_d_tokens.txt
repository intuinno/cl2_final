\ 
I wanna make a Tchart\ 
Label all the Ts\ 
So transactions can be made with ease\ 
I gotta put the credits on \ 
the right of the graph\ 
and the debits will go on the left\ 
Oh , every time our chart is done\ 
Subtract the small < PROPFIRST > from the big\ 
Ending balance double underline\ 
Oh I , I swear , DR must equal CR\ 
So i can be a billionaire 
It's a quarter after one , I'm all alone , and I need you now . \
