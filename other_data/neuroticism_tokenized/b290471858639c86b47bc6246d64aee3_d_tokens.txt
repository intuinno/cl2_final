headed to party 
2 parties today , 1 yesterday , 1 tomorrow .. I think I think I should get a RedBull 
Every single night we fight to get a little high on life\ 
To get a little something right , something real , at least we try\ 
Time after time , track dodging all the douche bag guys\ 
Track trading all the wasted times for something real in this crazy life
