Cowboy Up ! Need I say more ? 
Going to see a documentary on copywriting at the < PROPMALE > tonight at 7:30 pm . 
< PROPFIRST > Snyder author of the Save the Cat ! series died last night . 
No one should die because they cannot afford health care , and no one should go broke because they get sick . If you agree , please post this as your status for the rest of the day . 
My work laptop died today . :( Damn Blue Screen of Death 
Today is Friday ! 
Working on Press Start with people more talented than I am can be difficult at times . After the 25th of this month I will be moving at the speed of < PROPMALE > Edwards ! * or as close as humanly possibly * lol 
The talented < PROPMALE > Steiner , Unwatchable Films , is casting for his short comedy A Disjointed Proposal : Hilarity ensues when an unfortunate accident leads a commitment phobic waiter through a sequence of events in search of his severed finger while dodging his girlfriend's persistent requests to bond with her parents who happen to be dining at the same restaurant . 
We’re looking for all ages , genders and ethnic backgrounds . The shoot dates will be Friday Oct 23rd and Saturday 24th from 10pm till 5am . This is a no-budget student project . This means it’s not a paying gig , but a wonderful opportunity to exercise your amazing talent , meet new people/network , work on something fresh and have your work showcased in festivals around the country ! 
If interested , send your contact info , a picture and any related materials you’re interested in sharing that showcases your abilities to < PROPMALE > at : DisjointedProposal@gmail.com Audition location , time and date ( tentatively Oct 10th ) , as well as sides and character bios will be sent out this week . Thank you ! 
< PROPFIRST > Moore is such a hypocrite ! He keeps bashing capitalism even though the source of his hatred is what made him the name he is today and helps to fund his fact lacking films . Moore is estimated to be worth over $50 million . Gotta love it . 
Looking forward to seeing Zombieland with some friends around 7pm !! 
Auditions for A Disjointed Proposal are this Saturday at the Bartlett Performing Arts and Conference Center , 3663 Appling Rd Memphis/Bartlett TN 38133 starting at 8:00 am !! Looking forward to seeing old friends and meeting some new people ! 
Had a lot of fun kicking ass with some very talented people this weekend ! I meet some new people that I definitely want to keep in contact with ! 
Some people give time , some money , some their skills and connections , some literally give their life's blood . But everyone has something to give . 
Press .................................................. Start ! 
First day without every breath being followed by a cough ! The Pneumonia is pretty much gone ! Woohoo ! 
Save the Cat ! Strikes Back is out ! 
Looking forward to some Turkey ! 
Cooking is fun but at the same time it kinda sucks . 
Feeling a little unhappy . 
Today is a new day ! * crossing fingers * 
Illinois will now be known as Little Gitmo ! Wow ! Why do we reward murders from other countries and give them American right ?????? I realize that we have become the country of regret and guilt for any crime ever committed during the existence of the human race but this is becoming a bad trend . 
Last night I shipped some presents and make Chewy Caramel Bars with the wife . Look forward to some more time off from work ! Hoping I will be able to play a little bit of COD : MW2 with some friends . * hint hint - < PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE >!** 
Had a great Christmas with both sides of the family ! :) 
One of the pipes in my house busted and now we are trying to get it cleaned up and temporarily repaired until Home Depot opens up tomorrow . Yeah , now I get to deal with the insurance company . 
Time to show the world that more of us support our troops than dont ! If you support our troops then please post this on your status and leave it there for at least one hour !! AND IF YOU DON'T STAND BEHIND OUR TROOPS , THEN PLEASE FEEL FREE TO STAND IN FRONT OF THEM !!!!

There is danger from all men . The only maxim of a free government ought to be to trust no man living with power to endanger the public < PROPFEMALE > . - < PROPFIRST > Adams 
At 2:25 pm my friend lost her mother . Please pray for her and her family . 
Memphis Police are surrounding a woman down the street from our house that has been making threats . It has escalated to the point where SWAT ( with snipers ) and a Bomb squad have been called in . Say what you will about the Memphis Police Department but they have gone out of their way to help our neighborhood ! Thanks to all of the Boys in Blue that are working to keep us safe !
