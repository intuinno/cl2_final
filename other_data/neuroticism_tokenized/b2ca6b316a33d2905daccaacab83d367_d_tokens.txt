Have not been on facebook for 6 days . I've had lots of company and now getting ready to leave town . Have a great new year to ALL !!!! 

I'm trying not to stress about not being packed , nor knowing or having any kind of plan on what to pack . It's hard for a very organized person not to have a plan of any kind . If anybody prays , now is the time . I'm going to walk into a lot of unknown things 
Just flew in night before last , and got home about 12 midnight . Had an excellent trip and lots of success . All my accommodations were taken care off and my workshop was very good . Had a better flight home than there . The Shenandoah valley in Va . is so < PROPFEMALE >

Today I am , quietly , determined to have the best day ever . This I will tell myself , out loud , every time my head says something different . Life is to brief to waist one day in mediocrity . So- Today is the best , happiest , & most wonderful day yet !!!!!!!

CONTEMPLATIVE ??????

Thought 4 the day . -- Many people set up their lives to ensure that they're whipped around by \Drama\ " and therefore have an excuse for emotions over which they take no responsibility . " 
Intimacy is a human need . It is our nature to go beyond what we have done ; our frontier now is not survival but wholeness , the discovery of our deepest selves and our connection with our higher power . That is a tall order , and we need support to do it . The 
Had a fabulous day at church- !! Woke up this morning from a loud laughing noise . It was me !!! I was laughing soooo loud ; I woke myself up . Good day , good day !

ok , x-mass at Rachaels up . look at album x-mass party , 09 
took time to force my brain to slow down . am feeling much better about life . found a great statement 2day : God does not demand of me that I accomplish great things . He does demand of me that I strive for excellence in my relationships . 
? of the day : Do I tell God what I feel , or do I tell Him what I think He wants to hear ? 
point 2 ponder : When u lv the Lord , u lv Him with a unique voice- a voice that is different in soul than any other voice that God hears in all of creation . 
yesterdays ' thought ... Where have my thoughts been focused lately ? When was the last time I asked God to give me the strength to move forward in His power even though I was feeling weak ? 
point to ponder : To love God with your mind , you must put God's word into your mind . 
today's point to ponder : No one is outside the bounds of my love . ? to consider : Who is the person in my life I need to take the risk to love . verse : Love your neighbor as yourself 
Had a fabulous weekend singing , dancing , and catching up with good friends . We had some of the meatiest teaching ever !!!! Still missed my favorite friend . kisses 
pics . when you've had 4 glasses of champain !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'll try 2morrow !!!!! 
fixing earlier comment : Don't try 2 upload pics . after 4 glasses of champain !!!!!!! HELP- ME !!!!!!!!!!! 
I'll have 2 comment 2morrow !!!!!! nite all 
Consistant love can only be expressed one opportunity at a time . ( 1 Jn . 4:11 ) Dear friends , Since God loved us that much , we surely ought to love each other . How can I show love to the person right in front of me- today ? 
It's always a risk to love . An even deeper hurt is NOT to love . 
Jesus doesn't want us to try our hardest ; He wants us to learn to trust Him . A new commandment I give you : Love one another , as I have loved you , so you must love one another . 
How can I trust Jesus for the impossible in a relationship ? When Jesus becomes the standard , it is immediately obvious that we need a new relationship and power in our lives . 
Had a productive day : 1 . ) cooked rabbit skin glue & applied to stretched canvas , 2 . ) wiped < PROPMALE > l window sills in studio , 3 . ) vacuumed house , 4 . ) vacuumed studio , 5 . ) scrubbed < PROPMALE > l floors in house , 6 . ) wiped off < PROPMALE > l easels , 7 . ) scrubbed < PROPMALE > l tables and cleaned < PROPMALE > l painting p < PROPMALE > lets , 8 . ) cleaned out < PROPMALE > l turpentine , 9 . ) cleaned < PROPMALE > 3 baths . Now for a tea break !!!!!!! Good day 
If you've stopped feeling love , the first step is to begin to act with love again . ( Gal . 6:9 ) Let us not become weary in doing good , for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up . ( ? 2 consider ) Is there someone I don't feel like loving , whom I need to love ? 
Getting ready and revved up to do an ALL DAY yard clean up , & clorox everything imaginable . 
Chatting with one of my English friends having great fun !!! 
point 2 ponder : God will never command you to do something , He will not give you the power to do . verse : 1Jn . 4:18 - There is no fear in love . But perfect love drives off fear , because fear has to do w/ punishment . The one who fears is not made perfect in love . 
? 2 ponder : How can I take a love that's old & allow God to make it new ? 
I did get the dirt from 3 house in the draining ditches cleaned out yesterday , the front yard cleaned , the side , & all the leaves in back & back ditch cleaned up yesterday . GLAD THAT'S OVER !!!!!!! 2day- wash all the mold off the driveway , sidewalk , & back of house . 
Day 11 of my 40 day word fast : point 2 ponder : Jesus tok His own emotions seriously , & So he expressed those emotions openly & then CHOSE to ACT lovingly . verse : Jesus wept(Jn . 11:35 ) ? 2 consider : Is ther a feeling in my life that I haven't dealt with 
Kindness is on my mind . Kindness is expressed in doing the little things- & the little things add up to a great relationship . Kindness is practical : washing dishes , taking out the garbage , vacuuming , even when it's NOT ur turn . 
Kindness is taking ALL our hopes & dreams for our children's success & change their diapers & stay up all nite long when they ar sick . Kindness is taking our plans 2 \change the world\ " into serving hungry people in a soup kitchen or visiting the sick in a quite hospital room . " 
Yes , this is on my mind . I hope we all remember ; It's really NOT about us , so much as it is about loving one another in the small , unnoticed ways in the daily boring thing that all add up to being \ KIND \"!" 
I'V had house guest & just now getting 2 write . Had a great x-mas !!!!! Hope all did . Missed my little brother & grandson tho

Can't wait for Thursday for a full body therapy massage 
Romans 8:5 For those who are according to the flesh AND are controlled by it's unholy desires set their minds & purpose those things which gratify the flesh , but those who are according to the Spirit & are controlled by the desires of the Spirit set their minds on & seek those things which gratify the Holy Spirit 
Romans 8:6 Now the mind of the flesh [ which is sense & reason without the Holy Spirit ] is death [ death that comprises all the miseries arising from sin , both here & hereafter ] . But the mind of the Holy Spirit is life & soul peace [ both now & forevermore ] . 
Still waiting for clear bags to fed x in so I can pkg everything MADNESS !!!!! UGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Romans 8:33 Who shall bring any charge against God's elect[when it is ] God Who justifies [ that is Who puts us in right relation to Himself ? Who shall come forward and accuse or impeach those whom God has chosen ? Will God , Who acquits ? ] 
Romans 8:34 Who is there to condemn [ us] ? Will Christ Jesus ( the Messiah ) , Who died , or rather Who was raised from the dead , Who is at the right hand of God actually pleading as He intercedes for us ? 
Finally all ready to sing tonight-ALL night . 
Yes ! We had a lot of people this year from England . My friend from Italy was also here w/ her English husband of 7 mos . ( sweet ) Excellent conference !! Thanks 4 asking 
rms . 9:11 And the children were yet unborn & had yet so far done nothing neither good nor evil . Even so , in order to < PROPFEMALE > out God's purpose of selection(election , choice ) , which depends NOT on works or what men can do but on Him Who calls them . 
roms . 9:14 What shall we conclude then ? Is there injustice upon God's part ? Certainly not ! 9:15 For He says to < PROPMALE > , I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy & I will have compassion(pity ) on whom I will have compassion . 
roms . 9:16 So then[God's gift ] is not a ? of human will & human effort , but of God's mercy . [ It depends not on one's own willingness nor on his strenuous exertion as in running a race , but on God's having mercy on him ] . 
SO IN CONCLUSION : Maybe we should take time out of these EXTREMELY short lives & cry out for MERCY !!!!! 
Thought it was Saturday ?????? Call me 
Rms . 10:20 Then < PROPMALE > is so bold as to say , I have been found by those who did not seek Me : I have shown ( revealed ) Myself to those who did not [ consciously ] ask for Me . 
Let us start praying for God to reveal Himself to all those we love and that we want to spend eternity with . 
Entertaining friends from Italy & London . I'm pretty tired ! Not had my tea on time 4 7 days straight !! ugggggggghhhh ! 
Roms . 13:14 But clothe yourself with the Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) , and make no provision for [ indulging ] the flesh [ put a stop to thinking about the evil cravings of your physical nature ] to [ gratify its ] desires ( lusts ) . 
I'v been in the book of Romans now for awhile and have never gotten sooooo much out of it as recently . I'm seeing new perspectives every day . 
Having a blast with my friends from Italy & London 
Roms . 14:7 none of us lives to himself [ but to the Lord ] , and none of us dies to himself [ but to the Lord for ] 14:8 If we live , we live to the Lord , and if we die , we die to the Lord . So then , whether we live or we die , we belong to the Lord . 14:9 For Christ died and lived again for this very purpose , that He might be Lord both of the dead and of the living . 
I am learning to endure much more than I thought possible and enjoying the complete process !!!!! I'm learning , also how much I really do love God & how pleasant it is to walk in obedience . 
Roms . 15:1 , 2 , 3&13 We Who are strong [ in our convictions & our robust faith ] ought to bear w/ failings , frailties and the tender scruples of the weak ; [ we ought to help < PROPFEMALE > the doubts & qualms of others ] & not to please ourselves . 
Let each one of us make it a practice to please ( make happy ) his neighbor for his good & for his true welfare , to edify him [ to strengthen him & build him up spiritually ] . 
For Christ did not please Himself [ gave no thought to His own interests ]; but , as it is written , The reproaches & abuses of those who reproached & abused fell on Him . 
May the God of our hope so fill you with all joy & peace in believing [ through the experience of your faith ] that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound & be overflowing ( bubbling over ) with hope . 
Just went through < PROPFIRST > Rocks photos of Herbie ; I can hardly see for crying so hard . I am sooooo sorry for the lose of one man who really , and truly loved his family . I wish he had not been sick for so , so , so long . Heaven will be richer for gaining him and he'll finally get to see everything clearly . 
Just said good-bye to last student , cooked 4 my friend who was picking up my other friends whom I cooked salmon 4 and drove them around 4 a few days enjoying their company . Now they are on their way to New Orleans to fly to Boston . Now to make my bed after washing laundry , dusting , cleaning all 3 bathrooms , & all the floors & carpets . 
A very IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT . My Birthday is on JUNE 23rd . ( LOL ! ) 
1 corin . 1:9 God is faithful(reliable , trustworthy , and therefore ever true to His promise , & He can be depended on ); by Him you were called into companionship & participation w/ His Son , Jesus Christ our Lord . 1:10 But I urge & entreat you , brethren , by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that all of you be in perfect < PROPFEMALE > & full agreement in what you say , 
And that there be no dissensions or factions or divisions among you , but that you be perfectly united in your common understanding & in your opinions & judgments . 
1 corin . 1:18 For the story & message of the cross is sheer absurdity & folly to those who are perishing & on their way to perdition , BUT to us who are being saved it is the [ manifestation of ] the power of God . 
1 corin . 1:28 And God Also selected ( deliberately chose ) what in the world is foolish to put the wise to shame , & what the world calls weak to put the strong to shame . 1:29 So that no mortal man should [ have pretense for glorying and ] boast in the presence of God . 
Really found some GREAT words today !!!!! 
I can FINALLY post the painting I did for Chip(my son-in-law ) 
I'm ALREADY filling up August's calendar !!!!!! HELP 
Ok went bridal gown shopping 4 2 days now & think we found a keeper for Tito's sister Amyee Yeah !!!!!!!!! She is going to be STUNNING !!!

Thanks to all my dear friends , I'm learning to be a better person ! Thanks to all . 
( 11:12 ) For as woman was made from man , even so man is also born of woman ; and all [ whether male or female go forth ] from God [ as their Author ] . 
Just spent the evening w/ my son , daughter-in-law & girls for < PROPFIRST>'s bday celebration at a nice steak house . Happy Birhday 2day 4 2morrow < PROPFIRST > ! 
Read some things today that I need a lot of change of heart in . 1corin . 13:7 Love bears up under anything & everything that comes , is ever ready to believe the best of every person , its hopes are fadeless under all circumstances , & it endures everything [ without weakening ] . I really MISS the < PROPFIRST > here especially lately . ugggggggghhhhhhhhhh !!!!! 
1corin . 13:12 For now we are looking into a mirror that gives only a dim ( blurred ) reflection [ of reality as in a riddle or enigma ] , but then [ when perfection comes ] ( Jesus ) we shall see in reality & face to face . Now I know in part ( imperfectly ) , but then I shall know & understand fully & clearly , even in the same manner as I have been known & understood [ by God ] . God HELP US ALL !! 
Happy Birhday to one of the best daughter-in-laws ever , < PROPFIRST > Gray !!!! lv ya 
I've got a lot to say BUT have decided not to . 
1corni . 15:56 Now sin is the sting of death , & sin exercises its power [ upon the soul ] through [ the abuse of ] the Law 
O death where is ur victory ? O death , where is ur sting ? 
15:51 Take notice ! I tell u a mystery ( a secret truth , an event decreed by God ) . We shall not all fall asleep [ in death ] , but we shall all be changed ( transformed ) 
! corinthians 15 : 50 But I tell u this , brethren , flesh & blood cannot [ become partakers of eternal salvation &] inherit or share in the kingdom of God ; nor does the perishable ( that which is decaying ) inherit or share in the imperishable ( the immortal ) . 
Hurrying ... It's Monday w/ my list : Go 2 health food store , stop get water , paint mural rush home eat , get ready 4 student in studio , get ready 4 house guest , etc ... Just a normal day !!!!!!! 
OK , My \NORMAL\ " say is almost at an end ! Hot Dog ! I'm truly excited 2 have peace " 
NOT SURE ... Hummmmmmmm ????????????????? 
1corin . 1 ;3 Who comforts us in every trouble(calamity , affliction ) , so that we may also be able to comfort ( console , encourage ) those who are in any kind of trouble or distress , with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted . 
1 corint . 1:3 Blessed be the God & Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of sympathy ( pity & mercy ) & the God [ Who is the Source ] of every comfort ( consolation & encouragement ) , 
What's up w/ u ????? u going 2 come 2 US in Aug ???

3:17 Now the Lord is the Spirit , & where the Spirit of the Lord is , there is < PROPFEMALE > ( emancipation from bondage , freedom ) 
3:15 , 16 Yes , down 2 this [ very ] day whenever < PROPMALE > is read , a veil lies upon their minds & hearts . But whenever a person turns [ in repentance ] 2 the Lord , the veil is stripped off & taken away . 
2 Corin . 3:14 In fact , their minds were grown hard & calloused [ they had become dull & had lost the power of understanding ]; 4 until this present day , when the Old Testament is being read , that same veil still lies [ on their hearts ] , not being lifted that in Christ it is made void & done away with . 
2 Corint . 5:20 So we are Christ's ambassadors , God making His appeal as it were through us . We [ as Christ's personal representatives ] BEG YOU for His sake to lay hold of the divine favor [ now offered you ] and be reconciled to God . 
2 Corint . 5:15 And He died for all , so that all those who live might live no linger to and for themselves , but to and for Him Who died and was raised again for their sake . 
2 Corint . 5:10 For we must all appear & be revealed as we are before the judgment seat of Christ , so that each 1 may receive [ his pay ] according 2 what he has done in the BODY , whether good or evil [ considering what his purpose & motive have been , & what he has ACHIEVED , been busy with , AND GIVEN HIMSELF & HIS ATTENTION 2 ACCOMPLISHING ] . 
Going today , as yesterday , to help my sister clean , shop , prim and paint 4 room in her house after her husband has passed . I love my sister , she's the best and would help everyone that she could ! 
Trying to CONTAIN my jealousy !!!!!!!!! \ 
ok , ONWARD & FORWARD\ 
NEVER look back !!! Only DEATH behind a [ person trying to < PROPMALE > you down !!!! 
2 corinthians 7:1 Therefore , Since these [ great ] promises are ours , let us cleanse ourselves from EVERYTHING that Contaminates & Defiles body & spirit , & bring our consecration to completeness in the [ reverential ] fear of God . 
2 corinthians 7:10 For godly grief & the pain God is permitted to direct , produces a repentance that leads & contributes to salvation & DELIVERANCE from Evil , & it NEVER bring regret ; but worldly grief ( the hopeless sorrow that is characteristic of the pagan world ) is deadly [ bringing & ending in DEATH ] 
2 corinthians 7:4 I have great boldness & free & fearless confidence & cheerful courage toward you , my pride in you is great . I am filled [ brimful ] with the comfort [ of it ]; with all our tribulation & in spite of it , [ I am filled with comfort ] I am overflowing with joy . 
2 corinthians 7:6 But God , Who comfort , encourages , refreshes and cheers the depressed & the sinking , comfort , encourages , refreshes and cheers ME !!! 
Looken at one of my favorite pictures on my desk of someone peeking through their fingers ! Soooooooo lven them ... 
Going to < PROPMALE > gallery in shreveport 2day . can't wait till 11 to leave . 
2 corinthians 9:6 [ Remember ] this : he who sows sparingly & grudgingly will also reap sparingly & grudgingly & he who sows generously [ that blessing may come to someone ] will also reap generously and with blessing . ( this has to do w/ a promised gift from the Macedonia's 4 Jerusalem , BUT STILL holds true in every instance ) . 
Just back from Docs and bought a < PROPMALE > watermelon on the side of the road w/ 5 peaches that are out-of-this-world DELICIOUS ! Gonna cut into melon 2night . All for 8 bucks !!!!! 
All-of-a-sudden , Everything looks Waaaaaay different !!!! Ha-Ha-Ha 
Deuteronomy 6:7 You shall whet & sharpen them [ God's word ] so as to make them penetrate & teach & impress them Diligently upon the [ minds &] hearts of your children & shall talk of them when you sit in your house , when you walk by the way , when you lay down And when you rise up . 
Deuteronomy 6:4 & 5 Hear , O Israel : The Lord your God is one Lord [ the only Lord ] . And you will love the Lord your God with all your [ mind &] heart & with your entire being & with all of your might 
From a western I'm watching : I've seen men come in ALL sizes , but I've yet to find one worthy a women's < PROPFEMALE > ! ( HOW TRUE IS THAT) !!!! The more I find out about them , the more I can & choose to live without them . 
In 1 < PROPFIRST > 3:1 It states , \ Behold what manner of Love the Father has given unto us 
The earth's Polls Shifting is nothing new . In 2003 we had another one happen . Every time this happens \disasters\ " happen in & upon the earth . We might have to go to Alaska soon to go on a Florida vacation . " 
2 corin . 12:9 ... Therefore , I will all the more gladly < PROPFEMALE > in my weaknesses & infIrmities , that the strength & power of Christ may rest ( yes , may pitch a tent & dwell ) upon me ! 
2 corin . 12:10 So for the sake of Christ , I am well pleased & take pleasure in infirmities , hardships , persecutions , perplexities & distresses ; for when I am weak [ in human strength )] , then am I [ truly ] strong ( able , powerful in divine strength ) . 
Having a great day w/ Em 
When we act in love , it sets aside our personal agenda & seeks to model Christ . 
Just found the cutest guy on my match < PROPFEMALE > & he lives as close as Texas . \ 
YAAAAAHOOOOOO !!!!! I feel a road trip comen on !!!!!! 
Galatians 2:20 I have been crucified w/ Christ [ in Him I have shared His crucifixion ]; it is no longer I who live , but Christ ( the Messiah ) lives in me ; & the life I now live in the body I live by faith in ( the adherence to , reliance on & complete trust in ) the Son of God , Who loved me & gave Himself up for me . 
Also the Bible states : If I share in His death , I have been raised to newness of Life in Him . THEREFORE : My life is HID in Him at ALL times ! Unless I on purpose go against the love of Christ , I am considered SPOTLESS by GOD and NOONE else matters ! PERIOD !!!!!! Anyone else tired of , fed up w/ being cussed-out using scripture ? 
Proverbs 2:6 , 8 , 9 For the Lord gives skillful & godly Wisdom ; from His mouth come Knowledge and understanding . That He may guard the paths of justice ; yes , He preserves the way of His saints . Then u will understand righteousness justice , & fair dealing [ in every area & relationship ]; yes , u will understanding every good path . 
Prov . 2:10 -13 Skillfull & godly Wisdom Will enter ur heart & knowledge will b pleasant 2 u . Discretion will watch over u & , understanding will keep u , To DELIVER u from the way of evil men , from men who speak perverse things & are liars . Men who 4sake the path of uprightness 2 walk in the way of darkness . 
1 corinthians 6:19 Do u not know ur body is the < PROPFEMALE > ( the very sanctuary ) of the Holy Spirit Who lives within u , Whom u have received [ as a gift ] from God ? YOU ARE NOT YOUR OWN . ( 6:20 ) U were bought w/ a price [ purchased w/ a preciousness & paid 4 , made His own ] . So then , honor God & bring < PROPFEMALE > to Him in ur body . 
1 corinthians 6:15 Do u not SEE that ur bodies ar members ( bodily parts ) of Christ ( the Messiah) ?? Am I therefore 2 take the parts of Christ & make [ them ] parts of a prostitute ? Never ! NEVER !!!! 
Romans 13:14 But clothe yourself with the Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) , & make no provision for [ put a stop to thinking about the evil cravings of your physical nature ] to [ gratify its ] desires ( lusts ) . 
Romans 13:13 Let us live & conduct ourselves honorably & becomingly as in the [ open light of ] day , not in reveling ( carousing ) & drunkenness , not in immorality & debauchery ( sensuality & licentiousness ) , not in quarreling & jealousy . 
had a really busy weekend w/ house guest . got out & finished mowing front yard at 8:15 pm 2day then it started raining . had 2 stop . Dang 
I will not say words of bondage again . I can have anything I choose anytime I choose . All things are permissible , BUT not all things are beneficial . I refuse to be mastered by things that are not beneficial to me , because I am the < PROPFEMALE > of God . 
1 corintians 6:20 You were bought with a price [ purchased w/ a preciousness & paid for , made His own ] . So then honor God & bring Him < PROPFEMALE > in your body . None of us were made by ourselves & non of us can rely on ourselves . Only God is able to open our eyes , minds , hearts to Himself . Ask him to do so & He is ever faithful to comply . 
Happy Birthday < PROPFEMALE > . See u tonight !

Jn . 6:69 And we have learned to believe & trust , & [ more ] we have come 2 know [ surely ] that You are the Holy One of God , the Christ ( the Anointed One ) , the Son of the living God . 
Jn . 6:67 Jesus said 2 the Twelve , Will you also go away ? [ And do you too < PROPFEMALE > to leave Me ? ] 6:68 < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > answered , Lord , 2 whom shall we go ? You have the words ( the message ) of eternal life . 
< PROPMALE > . 15:20 These ar what makes a man unclean & defile [ him ]; but eating w/ unwashed hands does not make him unclean or defile [ him ] . 
< PROPMALE > . 15:19 For out of the heart come evil thoughts ( reasonings & disputings & designs ) such as murder , adultry , sexual vice , theft , false witnessing , slander , & irreverent speech . 
< PROPMALE > . 15:11 It's not what goes into the mouth of a man that makes him unclean & defiled , but what comes out of the mouth ; this makes a man unclean & defiles [ him ] 
How we need a keen awareness\ 
Of God's voice that is His Word , \ 
Quite whispers , gentle nudgings , So we'll make Him < PROPMALE > & Lord-Anon 
gal . 6:4 But let every person scrutinize , examine , & test his own conduct & his own work . He can then have personal satisfaction & joy of doing something commendable [ in itself alone ] without [ resorting to ] boastful comparison with his neighbor . 
Galatians 6:9 And let us not loose heart , grow weary and faint in acting nobly and doing right , for in due time & at the appointed season we will reap , If we do not relax our courage & faint . Gotta go paint now
