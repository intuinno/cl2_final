Hi , I was allowed to get a facebook . 

I like hugs ! 
I am so happy ~ It is a 5 day weekend ~ 
I need another 5 day weekend ... so sleepy ~ 
Happy Friday the 13th ~ 
I am sick of being sick . 
It is Thursday ! Only one more day till the weekend ! Sorry I am kinda hyper right now ... 
Frieday !!!!! 
IT'S FRIDAY ~ 
I had fun at ATF ~ It was so much fun ! http://www.acquirethefire.com/ 
“Many men kill themselves for love , but many more women die of it” 
The wheels turn slowly and we drift apart , you stay still but I'm pushed forward . 
Question of the day , how do you tell a guy that you like him ? 
I believe in angels , the kind that heaven sends . I’m surrounded by angels , and I call them my best friends . 
Last night i sent an angel to watch over you while you were sleeping . It came back early and i asked it why ? Its said “Angels dont watch over other Angels” 
NO one is worth your tears .. but the one who is , won’t make you cry 
There is no distance too far between best friends , for friendship gives wings to the heart 
If all my friends were to jump off a bridge , I wouldn't jump with them , I would be at the bottom to catch them 
Many people will walk in and out of your life , but only true friends will leave footprints in your heart . 
cheesy pick up line of the day : So .. did it hurt when you fell from heaven ? 
Friends , are angels who lift us up to our feet when our own wings have trouble remembering how to fly . 
Without friends no one would choose to live , though he had all other goods . Aristotle , Nichomachean Ethics 
* sigh * There has got to be more to life then this . 
Being happy doesn’t mean that everything is perfect . It means that you’ve decided to look beyond the imperfections . 
I am so confuzled on why we even try in life . We are only going to get old and die anyway . 
Time to win the soccer game ! \ 
Wish us luck ~ 
\What will you do to help someone along the way ? \ 
“A hug is the perfect gift . One size fits all , and nobody minds if you exchange it . ”

Wants to curl up in a ball and die 
I love my friends . As it is said in Fruits Basket : My happiness comes from the kindness of those around me . Thank you soooo much Karius ?? for listening to me rant these last few days . 
It is interesting and saddening to see how your old love uses lines that worked on you , to win another girls heart . 
So , I went and visited HCA yesterday ... It was fun to see people again ^_^ 
It is a good day to curl up in a blanket , with a good book and a cup of hot apple cider . 
\I found my < PROPMALE > charming ! \ " \ 
Is atempting to make cosplays ... this is so much harder then it sounds ... * emo corner * 
WE wear the mask that grins and lies , \ 
It hides our cheeks and shades our eyes , — \ 
This debt we pay to human guile ; \ 
With torn and bleeding hearts we smile , \ 
And mouth with myriad subtleties . 
... Hey you , looking at my status . Hi ! \

\I mean you can't even tell if he is male or female\ " \

If you are feeling stressed , give yourself a break . Eat some ice cream , chocolates , < PROPFEMALE > & cake . Why ? Because STRESSED spelled backwards is DESSERTS !!! :D 
Excuse me , are you lost ? Because heaven is a long way from here . 
“Dance as if no one were watching , Sing as if no one were listening , And live every day as if it were your last”
