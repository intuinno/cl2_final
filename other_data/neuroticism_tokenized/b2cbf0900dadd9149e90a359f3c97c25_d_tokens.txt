< PROPFIRST > did amazingly well with his surgery today . Thank God its over -- no more front teeth .. will post a picture as soon as we get one .. although he'll have this smile for what , 3 years ! LOL ! 

I can't believe we don't have homework to do ... We're free ! 
looking forward to some hot summer days w/o rain ! 
is tired of having to replace perfectly good stuff or see things go unworn because someone made a crack about it . I know Christian is hyper-senesitive but , sheesh , how do others deal with this ? 
overwhelmed at getting the house back in order after being away & only a few days of summer's freedom left 
growing more melancholy every hour .... 
looking forward to watching < PROPMALE > play at the One Night of Song & Dance on Sat night at Wenonah Lake . 
staying up late on the ' puter again ... tired ... 
loving my new CLEVERCAT top-entyr litterbox from PetSmart ! It's a cat-owner thing , but no litter on the floor is a godsend ! LOL see : clevercatinnovations.com 
I lost my To DO LIst !!!! 
GrandmomRose is back in the hosp ... blood clot in her leg ... but she is taking it in stride & even acting like an old pro in the hospital ... giving the PT folks grief for repeating the same basic exercises she had already graduated from doing a couple weeks ago . 
is reorganizing the basement into a sort of man cave/playroom . 
< PROPFIRST > asked for Grandmom everyday she was in the hosp ... So glad she came home on Thursday & is doing great ... Got all the meal reports LOL 
Loved watching the kids at the Steam trip today . What a great Field Trip !! They were all such troopers ! With such a wonderful resource so close by , I really wish they did such hands on learning in earlier grades -- at least by 3rd ... 
hoping there is no rain out for the rescheduled One Night of Song & Dance this Saturday ! < PROPMALE > is playing on 14 ( of 40 ) songs & I am really looking forward to seeing it !!!! He has worked really hard to get the old hands back ! 
Yay !!!! PHILLIES ... what a nail biter of a 9th inning !!!! :)))))) 
struggling with a tween tonight :( 
YAY Phillies ! Have to buy Christian some Phillies garb :))) 
living in Weight Watcher Hell ... a delicious lite & creamy birthday cake ( for Grandmom ) , cinnamon sticky buns , biscotti , & < PROPFEMALE > bread cookies courtesy of Grandmom ! 
Woooo Hoooo ! PhILLIES !! What a fun game !! 
still taking care of a sick little < PROPFIRST > ... What a trooper through a nasty cold & 103+ fever all week !... although the cabin fever has really gotten to him ... he wants to go to a restaurant ! :) 
We hit day 10 today of < PROPFIRST>'s virus .. still has a fever , cold symptoms have subsided except or a nasty cough ... visit to Doc on day 5 = no strep , no ear inf ., lungs clear .. may have to go back now ... poor kid :(( 
Justn is finally fever free ! Just a nasty cough and a bit of an itchy rash remains of the virus .. what an ordeal .. 13 days !! 
More on < PROPFIRST > .. He has pneumonia ! ... thought he was better when the fever was finally gone , but still isn't eating , cough is not gettihng better & was mysteriously hurting last night ... might have been chest pain ? poor kid .. Chest x-ray tomorrow , meds today . 
Today's To Do LIST : 2 Sons , 2 Doctor vists , & 6 X-rays = = 1 compression injury to a big toe => 4weeks in a special shoe & an early end to soccer season + 1 pneumonia diagnosis pending confirmation . Pour me a glass of wine someone please ! 
Thanks so much for all the kind birthday wishes .. It might seem odd to enjoy a birthday spent at a funeral .. but it was a nice feeling to have my dear mother-in-law spend the day amidst family she rarely gets to see anymore . And < PROPFIRST > was so well-behaved ! 
is happy ELF YOURSELF is back ! Can't wait for all the funny videos to roll in !!! 
is LOL at the Cap'ns Log & comments section etc . in Facebook's Pirate English version . 
It's that time of year Birthday Celebrations ! 
We're on Day 8 and counting ... Christian has what < PROPFIRST > had ... horrific cough w/ fever that stayed high a few days and now won't budge from hitting 101.5 every afternoon ... already missed 5 days of school , one birthday party & now the Class Thanksgiving feast . :( 
Oh the overwhelming time of year has begun ... so much to do & so little time & I was dertmined to get an early start . I already feel behind and it's not even December 1 yet ! 
With mom in the hospital my sister & I are looking for a restaurant or Christmas < PROPFEMALE > that serves the traditional 7Fishes dinner .. suggestions anyone ? 
Did the Night Owl shopping thing at Kohls tonight ... finally made a serious dent in the Christmas list , got some great deals & it wasn't crowded ! 
I'm officially overwhelmed with no where to turn ... 
Tree is up :) & almost decorated , begin cooking tomoorrow ... a < PROPMALE > more shopping to do & lots & lots of wrapping awaits ... BUT I want to bake my cookies !! 
am thankful for the jolly white-bearded gentleman in the < PROPFEMALE > hat , who so delightfully responded to < PROPFIRST>'s awe at seeing < PROPFEMALE > Claus in the supermarket 
is wrapping , wrapping and more wrapping 
wrappped well into this morning while watching \The Women\ " and the most of \ " Elizabeth\ " ... they were both good movies and I kept getting caught up in the movie and not wrapping !!! Finally finished all the regular presents & all the kids stuff by this afternoon :)))) " 
Had a nice dinner with my sister's family at < PROPFEMALE>'s where at least the two of us could indulge in the traditonal Seven Fishes Christmas < PROPFEMALE > Feast ! < PROPFEMALE > CHRISTMAS TO ALL ! 
finished packaging up 7 returns to ship out & made a list of store returns to get done next week ... fun fun fun 
undecorating is like putting away the groceries ... not my favorite task , but it's all the shlepping that makes it truly tiresome 
undecorating stalled at about 55% done whilst I am \little kid sick\ " with a head cold/fever/flu symptoms . phooey :(( " 
what's with the color postings ? 
My queue at Blockbuster is empty .. movie rental recommendations please . 
glad that day is over ... shattered my antique glass cake dish cover , had the toilet overflow twice ( clean water but yikes ! so much it was pouring down the in-floor heat vent ) and then stepped on the brown bag full of glass pieces with a barefoot ... don't ask how ... but yes , a bloody foot . 
OK back to bed .. after waking up at 2am , letting the dog out , turning off lights , putting dishes in the dishwasher/running it , then checking facebook/email ... seems mom is the only one who can close up the house properly .. not good when I fall asleep early w/ < PROPFIRST > 
Justins ' good as gold today & last night after his little \procedure\ " at CHOP . Never needed any pain meds for his little incision & was totally unconcerned after a very long sleep yesterday ! Glad that's over . :) " 
If you call here , let me apologize in advance that < PROPFIRST > is the only one answering the phone these days & he'll keep talking & talking ... gives me a break though to have someone else do the listening and the listening ... LOL 
The new snow blanket is falling fast & Christian has already proclaimed this \great snowball snow ! \ " I can feel this is going to start early tomorrow !! " 
Reach up to grasp the stars , but never forget to enjoy the flowers at your feet . Happy Valentines Day to all

< PROPMALE>'s facebook has been hacked . He is not in LONDON & has cancelled his facebook page -- he * is * swamped at work this week after missing all of last week if anyone wants to help with that , though ! 
While I was on trying to cancel < PROPMALE>'s < PROPFEMALE > I saw an IM between another friend & the FRAUD ! & then another one went up to < PROPMALE > Kapus almost immediately becuase the first guy was aksing him questions to try to confirm his identity !!

please put this as your status for 1 hour . Think of the ones you know or love who have or had cancer . My wish is that 2011 a cure will be found . Will you post it for 1 hour . Do it for all . There are too many to mention who have fought and who are fighting . 
The Girl you just called fat ? She has been starving herself & has lost over 30lbs . The Boy you just called stupid ? Has a learning disability & studies over 4hrs a night . The Girl you just called ugly ? She spends hours putting makeup on hoping people will like her . The Boy you just tripped ? He is abused enough at home . There's a lot more to people than you think . Put this as your status if you're against bullyIng . 
Must be Spring ... for the third day in a row Christian came home covered in mud , today he arrived sans one shoe -- the other got stuck in the muck when he , once again , fell into the lake !
