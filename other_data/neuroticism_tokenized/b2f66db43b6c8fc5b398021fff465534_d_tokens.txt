jealousy is a disease and i dont want ur sickness ! 
“A silly idea is current that good people do not know what temptation means . This is an obvious lie . Only those who try to resist temptation know how strong it is ... A man who gives in to temptation after five minutes simply does not know what it would have been like an hour later . That is why bad people , in one sense , know very little about badness . They have lived a sheltered life by always giving in . ” - C.S. < PROPFIRST > 
“Please don't lie to me , unless you're absolutely sure I'll never find out the truth . ” - < PROPFEMALE > Brilliant 
jealousy is a disease and i don't want ur sickness !

“The greatest ignorance is to reject something you know nothing about” 
“We cannot change our past . We cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way . We cannot change the inevitable . The only thing we can do is play on the one string we have , and that is our attitude . I am convinced that life is 10% what happens to me and 90% of how I react to it . And so it is with you ; we are in charge of our Attitudes . ”- CS
