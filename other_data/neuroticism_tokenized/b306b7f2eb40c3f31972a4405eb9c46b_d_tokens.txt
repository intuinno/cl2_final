Summer always causes me to be alone with myself , causing me to go over every little aspect about my life and others . So now I can say without a doubt , that Light likes bunnies just as much as I do . But he still hates a good majority of the world . 
ah .. Life continues to intertwine in its Disgusting manner . Such lack of control has set much of our world in great Decay . I yearn for the day that my decision has been set into motion . \ 
\ 
One day .. I shall throw the world into the right direction ... but I will need the help of many to do this .

After what has been about 3 months , my computer is finally up and running thanks to Kajir . Though it was hard , I did manage to pass the time by studying , doing lab stuff , celebrating a few holidays , and getting Halo Reach and actually owning nibs . Its been fun in my own little world , but its time for me to get back to networking !
