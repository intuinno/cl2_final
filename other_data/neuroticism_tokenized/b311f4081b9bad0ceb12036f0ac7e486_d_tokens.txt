My bedroom walls are the exact same color as masking tape , Insideout socks do not go on the bathroom shelf on top of the washcloths , Straps that < PROPFEMALE > off of my pants cause me to fall on my face , It is impossible to keep my room clean if I say it will never be messy again , And Clocks that go tick .. tock .. tick .. tock ...

Hmm ... Is it selfish to want someone to get their head out of their butt , if only for the reason that you're tired of worrying about them suffocating ? ( metaphorically speaking of course . ) If it is , then I am a little bit selfish ... 
I went into < PROPMALE > Pennys with Becca and came out with a dress for Homecoming within one hour . Isn't that spectaculer !? Now I just need shoes .. =) Tomorrow I will obtain shoes . And they shall be amazing . 
There is a fine line between caring and empathizing ; I have yet to find it . 
Feels ... Yucky . And sort of like I'm going to cry or something ...? How unusual . I shall blame my teenage girl hormones ! Lovely , aren't they ? :D haha ... 
\ ... Fighting for survival and I guess I must Be winning And my story is so long I can't remember the beginning Am I an optimist Or am I a pessimist If I see a half empty half full cup Is half full Of nothingness ... \""
