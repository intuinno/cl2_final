hi 
My summer has been boring . 
I just waited an hour for a movie to load , and it got stuck at 6 seconds , and won't go any further . Gonna finifh Twilight for the 90th time ... then , probably , off to bed . 
My favorite books are White Fang , Where the Red < PROPFEMALE > Grows , the Twilight Saga , The Maximum Ride Novels , and basically every other book I read . Maybe I have no favorites . 
hola\\ 
Yesterday , we took < PROPFEMALE > to the vet , and she got 2 shots , and had blood drawn . Busy day . But , now she can interact freely with other dogs . 
My mom did some research and , apparently , < PROPFEMALE > is a Shiba Inu Mix . 
Earlier this evening , < PROPFEMALE > jumped out of my mom's moving car ! She has some wounds , but no serious injuries . Thank goodness she's alright .. 
Happy 4th of July !

I have to stay up for at least 1 more hour , ' cause guess what ? I'm doing the laundry !! Shocker , my mom would be so proud if she was awake right now . Except , maybe , she would tell me not to do it so late at night . 
I might be getting the LG Optimus S . It doesn't have a physical keyboard , though . :/ 
Finally finished the laundry ! Victory is mine ! 
< PROPMALE > just got his new Apple Macbook Pro ! He's so lucky !
