You can tell by the glass on the floor , \ 
And the strings that are breaking , \ 
And i keep on breaking more , \ 
And it looks like i am shaking ... \ 
But it's just the tempature . 
Late nights and weekends , \ 
Our hearts only run slowly\ 
On the local track . \ 
So \ 
I've arranged for your phobias\ 
To be performed by a string quartet . 
< PROPFEMALE > takes the stairs\ 
But she can't tell that it's a winding spiral case , \ 
Is she rightside up , or upside down ? 
How bad of an idea is it , to get baked before i finish this paper that i'm less than halfway done with ? \ 
Guess i'm gonna figure it out right now :D

Possibly the worst night ever ... \ 
I'll be up for awhile . \ 
Hit me up if you got a pick-me-up . 
He won't be too happy\ 
And he'll have his lawyer\ 
Come down from the city\ 
And arrest you , mister , \ 
So i wouldn't miss me\ 
If you get me , mister , \ 
See ? 
No prior arrangement , \ 
For today's engagement\ 
To all patrons :\ 
We intend on fixing\

Thank you , \ 
Red Faction Guerrilla .

So stoked . \ 
Even unfinished , \ 
The music is wonderful . 
And so the cyclicality of the holidays continues . \ 
Somehow , \

Every\ 
Time\ 
It rolls around . \
