sleep refuses to make an entrance - therefore , watching < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > johannsson revel in their insomnia . 
had a man remove much of the hair on his head . it's liberating , yet frightening , and I keep touching it . 
GIS is so fucked , and yet strangely I still love it -- apparently , more proof of my inherent masochism . 
in summary : fur coats and fake money , gambling and GaGa , whoppers and winning - actually , mostly not winning , dammit .

sangria fun times in the park today , how fetching . also , I simply refuse to wear shorts ever , high of 71 or not - I am a trousers man , I do declare . 
is , post-haircut , itchy itchy itchy . and it's totally not my sweater , I swear . 
sleep deprivation , a lingering flu , and a full closing shift does not make for a very happy boy . 
adores rainy nights , the streets gleaming from the streetlights , almost like rivers . 
okay , so apparently there's a bat flying around my apartment ? window screens are a must-have , ladies and gentlemen . 
hark ! < PROPFIRST > Torres and I have decided : \entertaining\ " is my new euphemism for bedroom interactions at my apartment . "

mmm , indeed . streaking , in the moonlight , in the sunken gardens . that happened . that confirms it ! real < PROPFEMALE > it is , then . 
I just tripped on the stairs at the lab , so naturally I overcompensated by running up then really quickly , tripping at the top of them as well . 
today's bit of obvs : 05 + 05 = 10 . what a marvelously clever boy I be . 
facking jesus yes , I snagged an internship over the summer at the institute for urban design . ow-ow . !!! 
5:25 to huntington , kiddie-birthday-bound , should I have brought a present ? um . so . 
I daresay today is pretty : roll around on the grass with me . 
< PROPMALE > grey and < PROPFEMALE > castles , into the night . I think I'll make us an omelette . 
20 + 1 = !!! 
hmm , now exactly what does one do with memorial day ? grill meat ? fireworks ? shopping's a given , I know that . 
happy travels , darlings < PROPFEMALE > Sieg and Chloë < PROPFEMALE > Stillwell - fear not , we'll mind the island for you . every goddamn brick and block . 
I've been living unsustainably today and I rather don't care . it's okay , my favourite colour is green - that counts , right ? actually , chartreuse . 
good morning , sunshine . I'll be sleeping for hours yet . 
at times I feel that I'm merely a series of non-sequiturs . 
HOLY FUCKS . my building's management just showed my apartment to this girl and I was home , semi-naked , blasting < PROPFIRST > mellencamp . 
attempt at internet independence : enlightening , though currently a failure ( obvs ) . hullo , lady interweb . you've been missed . 
hmm . so , if I left a creepily pleasant voicemail on your phone this morning sometime around dawn -- I apologize . profusely . but I must admit , I was in a rather excellent mood . 
... and so ends the season-long fb moratorium . have I neglected your friend request ? rejoice ! 
so I'm rather cold at the moment , pining for my sweaters . which are in storage . in queens . grr . 
my flatmate ( the israeli ) absolutely LOVES nip/tuck . a sultry , breathy \make me beautiful\ " from the theme song wakes me up every morning . " 
post-saturday delirious haze , and now I believe there's a baby shower in dumbo ? blessed child , I'm spent . 
a baby shower in dumbo : DJ and open bar , what what what ? also , a whole roasted pig -- this is a filipino baby , after all . 
the charger has run away , therefore : incommunicado . chained to the interwebs , yet again . 
required : an evening's entertainment . I'm wide open . we're talking hot dogs and hallways here , kids . 
isn't it rather troubling that the first fruit I've had in almost a month was in several glasses of sangria ? 
is buried in readings ! whilst simultaneously on grindr , commenting on captivating things in the backgrounds of guys ' profile photos : \I've never been on a hot air balloon ... \"" 
three things : I swear my umbrella leaks in the rain , wet jeans are impossible to get off , and I'm by myself in the apartment , realizing I'm outnumbered by cats . 
southbound today , for another whirlwind . also , I just dropped off my laundry -- my ticket number ? 7557 . what what what . !!! 
the big city by sunrise -- such is the promise of the chinatown bus . northward ! 
my flatmate's israeli telenovellas have little snippets of english that allow for convoluted plot lines to emanate from the living room . 
sudden onset of flu-like symptoms ! therefore , the plan is tea , frequent hand washing , capote . 
ew . as I was walking home from work , I saw macaulay culkin on bleecker . also , there was a man playing bucket drums -- but he had no arms ! 
I picked up my dry cleaning , I'm booking a lunch for next Tuesday , and < PROPFEMALE > Robinson is a soon-to-be-licensed motorist . so it's confirmed--we're all grown-ups . 
hello , social networking . goodbye , again--I'm going back to the postcard thing . 
so I haven't been online since before they changed the IM sound ( and I rather miss that popping noise ) . 
consolidated < PROPMALE > be damned : a $105 energy < PROPMALE > ? there goes walking around the house naked . 
OH MY GOD THESE PEOPLE HAVE NO LIQUOR HOW CAN I WHAT 
I brought the winter down with me from the north , it seems . white white exmas , y'all . 
snowed-in status update , forty-something divorcée edition : gobbling down chocolates and cheap south carolinian wine , and chasing down the cat that lives here . hmm , maybe I'll microwave some peaches . 
post-frenzy : some breathing room , and < PROPMALE > jeux d'enfants . also , a certain mister gyllenhaal (!!!) looked at < PROPFEMALE > Gonza < PROPMALE > and I whilst we gobbled british food . gluttony well-deserved . 
reptar is abusing his microwave privileges : the tangy smell of leftover hot wings is now permeating my duvets . 
thundersnowing ! flashes of lightning ! it's only the end of the world , kids , and I'm making hot cocoa . 
I made snow angels on my roof today , it was chilly and wet and the view was superb -- wish you were there with me , kids . 
got that feeling after putting something in the oven that I could've melted cheese over it , and am now kicking myself for such negligence . of cheese . 
three to five inches of meteorological fuckery , ARGH . alas , the groundhog speaks nothing but lies . 
2:36 am . y'all should see my just-got-home-from-work bitchface . I'm attempting to liveblog that mess .
