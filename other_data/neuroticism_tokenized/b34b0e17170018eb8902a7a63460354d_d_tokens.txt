Find out what his dreams are - just to find out , for no other reason . Because as soon as you lay your hands on a conversation to steer it , it's not a conversation anymore ; it's a pitch . And you're not a human being ; you're a marketing rep. 
It doesn't matter whether you're selling Jesus or Buddha or civil rights or ' How to Make Money in Real Estate With No Money Down . ' That doesn't make you a human being ; it makes you a marketing rep. If you want to talk to somebody honestly , as a human being , ask him about his kids .

My little baby soul was not a happy infant , of course , with much to complain about , but as every parent learns , a restless baby often calms down if you take it for a ride . I had learned my squalling spirit could be soothed the same way , by motion , and so I had decided to set off on this journey into the unknown .

i'm worried about the infection on my other finger that showed up at christmas . it's still there . but it's burried underneath , not boiling up and coming out . it's just insidiously there , throbbing feverishly , itchy at times . i keep thinking that i have an excellent immune system but can this , without having an outlet , go inside and destroy me with some sort of systemic staph infection in my blood system or heart ? 
i didn't get any laptop repair work done today as i had planned . the big kids took over both computers and the baby slept on the laptop ... gonna shoot for tomorrow while the bigguns are at school and the baby underfoot :-) or in lap

The bad news .... still no power . Good news , the only thing i damaged along the way was i accidentally melted a screw housing that's right next to the < PROPFIRST > , no biggy . 
Laptop problem solved ! my friend < PROPMALE > came over with a meter thing .... turns out the power cord was not getting any juice ! the power < PROPFIRST > was slightly loose and tend to break in toshibas anyway so now with my replacement ... it's very robust , sturdy and not likely to break .... and i learned alot . and the < PROPFIRST > tested good so when i get a new cord I'm sure everything is going to be back on track . yay ! i'm so happy !!!

Compassion is not just being kind to your friend . That involves attachment because it is based on expectation . Compassion is when you do something good without any expectations  based on realizing that the other person is also just like me . \

my profile pic thumbnail looks kinda creepy ! it's cool when you click on it tho . 
hmmm disturbing ! ... i found that if you go to account settings you will find a link where you can download all your information from facebook . messages , statuses , posts , links , and notes . everything . even if you deleted it last year . facebook has a copy of everything . 
0_o 2 of my friends are attending an FB event called ' tell her she's beautiful ' .... some random person posted porn on the event page ..... now it looks like my 2 friends actually posted the porn into my newsfeed ! I know better and that it was someone else , but some don't!!! I'm starting to really dislike Facebook !!! 
Wow ! Wow ! Wow !!!! before christmas , while shopping at amazon i ran across Google Netbooks coming soon and an option to Sign up for Beta testing after taking a ' do you live on the internet ' test , and i passed with flying colors . I apparently got accepted for beta testing because I got a laptop from Google today ! nuts ! No apparent strings other than using it and giving feedback . 
Personal note : When I was a little kid my mother told me not to stare into the sun , so once when I was six , I did . At first the brightness was overwhelming , but I had seen that before . I kept looking , forcing myself not to blink , and then the brightness began to dissolve . My pupils shrunk to pinholes and everything came into focus and for a moment I understood .

If tomatoes are fruit , isn't ketchup technically a smoothie ?
