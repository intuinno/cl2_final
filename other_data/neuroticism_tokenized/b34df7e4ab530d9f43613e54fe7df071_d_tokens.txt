I wish it was hotter outside so then all the people that complain about the weather will suffer more . Enjoy it people dont be stupid and stay inside all day 
If you want change , you must be the change you wish to see in the world .

Never take life too seriously . Remember nobody gets out alive anyway 
If there are no stupid questions , then what kinds of questions do stupid people ask ? Do they get smart just in time to ask a question ? 
I wouldn't steal a car but I'd download one if I could

Will Ferrell should drop dead ... Now that would be funny

So today I found out why sprint has been charging me 2 dollars extra every mounth . I guess sending pictures to my iPod then pitting them on my comp counts as using the web . So now I got to buy some USB thing for my phone . Damn u sprint 
Fuck Sundays , Every place you go to is closed

So yesterday while I was at the mall some random Christian pastor came up to me and started talking to me . I was as friendly as I could to him and he assured me god will forgive all my sins if I accept him into my life . I don't know about that but it was certainly something you don't experience everyday . 
Accept yes into your life 
So my neighbor just knocked on my door yelling at me for playing music to loud . I shut the door on him :D . Lets see if he likes < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > instead ! Excited to see how this night ends . 
Serj Tankian is one of the most talented men alive 
Ok I got a problem , so I want to move my computer downstairs , out of the computer room . The only thing that's stopping me is not having internet on it . I have a wireless router but when I take out the Ethernet cord i lose internet and it cant find the wireless signal or something . Anyone got any solutions that wont cost me a fortune ?
