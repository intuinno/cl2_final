The beating of my heart is a drum , and it's lost , and it's looking for a rhythm like you . You can take the darkness from the pit of the night , and turn into a beacon burning endlessly bright . 

I hold on cause I can't let go , I refuse to let the hands of fate unfold ... 
Y si fuera capaz de mirarte y decir lo que siento . Si pudiera tenerte más tiempo < PROPMALE > tiempo que tengo . Si pudieras venir a mi lado tan sólo < PROPFEMALE > momento . Si sólo fuera capaz de romper el silencio , y detenerte en el tiempo ... 
but what wisdom is there within us to live based on the feeling of our hearts ? 
ahh . the trebuchet is seriously going to make me cryyy . 
i have become comfortably numb ... 
I'm only happy when it rains , You wanna hear about my new obsession , I'm riding high upon deep depression , I'm only happy when it rains . 
yet that conflict still filling me , mistrust venom inside of me , I am not the man that you see , just look inside me . 
he walks by me , can he tell that I can't breathe ? I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night . 
It could be wrong , But it should've been right , Let our hearts ignite . \ 
Must erase it fast , It could be wrong , But it could've been right ... 
the writings on the wall , you've read that I'll be gone , but if you call my name , just know that I'll come running , for one more night to spare with you 
RedBull Air Race (: 
There's blood on my hands like the blood in you , some things can't be treated so , don't make me be myself around you . 
Hay veces que quisiera ahogarte en < PROPFEMALE > grito , y olvidarme de esa imagen tuya , pero no me atrevo . 
i love this weather (: 
at the lakeee (: 
Its impossible to wait until the light , cause I'm already gone , if you bet on me , you've won . 
tired of the chapter when you're acting insane , and here we are at the end of the day , we go together like kids and cocaine 
fun dayyy (: 
pero ya lo vez estoy mejor sin ti , ya vez que fue facil encontrar < PROPFEMALE > amor que me diera la calma que tu amor no me dio . 
that's what I do , kick people's ass (: 
As I Lay Dying was amazinggggg ! 
I'm unbroken , I'm choking on this ecstasy . Unbreak me , unchain me , I need another < PROPMALE > to live . 
Shattered by the hate I < PROPFEMALE > , take me as I am and make me whole again , I am lost without a purpose , always consumed by self , I freely give this calloused heart , can you forgive me ? 
I was wrong , something in me still has hope for you\ 
I don't know why . \ 
Everyone is not as good as they seem . \ 
Trust in me , trust in me . 
going swimming with my bestie , finally going to see herrrr (: 
Yo se que es imposible que me quieras a mi , mi amor no llegaras a comprender . Y sin embargo te llevo en mi ser , como < PROPFEMALE > loca y sentida obsesion . Por que te hicieron de roca y no puedes tener < PROPFEMALE > ... 
i suck at JustDance , - < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > snores & < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > can't swim . but i had an awesome time with themmm (: 
Será que el < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > brillando distinto a lo acostumbrado\ 
Lo que antes me afectaba ya no me dice tanto\ 
El color de mi < PROPFEMALE > cambio desde que tu llegaste\ 
Todo parece puesto bajo otra < PROPFEMALE > 
Michigan's Adventure (: 
Es que soy < PROPFEMALE > idiota que se muere de pena y < PROPFEMALE > tiemblan las piernas cuando tu te < PROPFEMALE > acercas , y es que soy < PROPFEMALE > novato que pierde su tiempo contando las estrellas y escribiendo poemas . Es que soy < PROPFEMALE > idiota que te ama en si < PROPFEMALE > ncio siempre con el deseo de decir que te quiero . 
ugh , i hate being sick 
And in this crazy life and through these crazy times . It's you , it's you . You make me sing , you're every line , you're every word . You're everything 
< PROPFIRST > Tijeras es definitivamente la mejor telenovela que he visto (: 
Si vos no estas aqui me voy a morir , si vos no estas aqui mi < PROPFEMALE > no es feliz . 
En lujuria sin razon , pero es que no puedo parar mi < PROPFEMALE > . Vaya contradiccion , < PROPFEMALE > m < PROPFEMALE > do de prejuicios sin solucion . Y los dos , diferentes , que se cruzaron solo casualmente . 
who ever 248 906 5406 is , needs to stop sending me stupid chain letters ! creeper 
pretty effing awesome night (; 
spent the whole weekend with - < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > , it was gooood :D 
eff you : 248 906 5406 , leave me alone ! 
Your voice is clawing at my ears all day , leaving me restless and plaguing my mind . 
Por mas que el mundo ofrezca nunca yo me alejare de ti . Yo vivo solo para ti Jesus 
I'd trade just about anything . You're what makes want to change things . I will die just to live and yet we all live to die . 
homecoming game (: 
homecominggg (: 
A tear in my brain allows the voices in . They wanna push you off the path , with their frecuency wires . And you can do no wrong in my eyes . 
Circle me and the needle moves gracefully back and forth . If my heart was a compass you'd be North . Risk it all cause I'll catch you if you fall (: 
Should've done something but I've done it enough , by the way , my hands were shaking . Rather waste some time with you . 
I told myself I won't miss you , but I remembered what it feels like beside you . And I think you should know this , you deserve much better than me . 
Tu me creaste para darte toda < PROPFEMALE > . (: 
I am gonna show you what I mean , \ 
I am gonna love like you’ve never seen . \ 
You are gonna live like you used to dream . This is your new song 
And no matter what we both had to go through , I just can't , can't hold on . 
My brother just told me that he's switching from rap to screamo . I feel accomplished : ' D 
I've said it once , I've said it twice , I've said it a thousand fucking times , that I'm ok , that I'm fine , that it's all just in my mind . But this has got the best of me and I can't seem sleep . 
to the movies with my bestfrienddd , leeeroyyyyy :D haha 
Shhhhanks everyone for the birthday wishes , but uhm , I still don't know who sent me the roses :/ lol 
A movie that plays in my mind , remembering you helps me survive . Every day a re-run of the next I promised to stay by your side . 
It's really good to hear your voice , saying my name it sounds so sweet . Coming from the lips of an angel , saying those words it makes me weak . 
I could give you fifty reasons why I should be the one you choose . All those other girls , well they're beautiful , but would they write a song for you ? 
screamo isn't bad , it takes talent to scream like that , and it's badassly amazing ! 
Yes , I will still eat five splices of pizza if I wish . No , I will not become a health freak , mom . 
I stare at the wall , watching my time float away . It's all been a blur and nothing will change . 
Why is everything going so wrong now that I'm trying to be a better person ? 
I just remembered a game I used to play with my mom when I was about seven . I would put long pillows in her < PROPMALE > size bed and I would lay there too . She had to guess which one was me . Silly game , but I loved it so much , ahahah . 
I can't stop watching My Super Psycho Sweet 16 even though it's a cheesy movie . I just love it 
I'll come up , I'll come up for peace . I'll come down , I'll come down for truth . I'll give in , I'll give in for you ? 
Close my eyes , just for tonight . The sun still sleeps , and when she wakes you'll be a memory . 
Que < PROPFEMALE > pasando con TV Azteca ? \dignificando\ " a las amantes y \ " apoyando\ " a jovenes que se embarazan :/ ayy " 
I see her in my dreams , wishing that she wasn't there . But she still haunts me . 
HUGE bonerkill ! I couldn't donate blood because I haven't been long enough in the country : l ! 
When I wake from this dream will you still be here ? Will your smile still open my heart and leave me transparent ? 
Pero si me vieras con los ojos que te veo , fuera tu < PROPFEMALE > y tu por siempre mi < PROPMALE > . Vivo y por ti me desvivo a ver si consigo , ser mas < PROPFEMALE > que < PROPFEMALE > amigo . 
I'd serve you drugs on a silver plate if I thought it would help you get away . I hope that you would do this for me . 
I'm out of words but I'm sure it'll never last . And I've been saving these last words for one last miracle , but now I'm not sure . I can't save you if you don't let me . You just get me like I've never been gotten before . 
< PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > & I are going to dominate the world :P yay 
Jessica : Hello ? Me : POPTARTS ! * hangs up * (: 
Es mas facil llegar < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > que a tu < PROPFEMALE > . Y no aguanto , me duele tanto estar asi , rayando el < PROPFIRST > . 
Love is the way we show peace , \ 
Love sets us free . \ 
Love is the bond that joins us \ 
to our community . \ 
Love is the answer \ 
that we've been searching for . \ 
It lives inside all of us , \ 
just open up the door , \ 
And Love to find Peace . - < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > 
Don't you let regret take place of the dreams you have to < PROPMALE > . 
Waka Flocka Flame is my guilty pleasure ;) 
Playing my songs is the way I cope with life . Won't keep my voice down , know the words I speak are the thoughts I think out loud . 
good way to start my week :D 
When I hear you say you love me , when I taste your lips I know that is true . When I feel your arms wrapped around me , I feel safe and secure & your love is the cure . ? 
So take me out tonight . This ship of fools I'm on will sink . A millstone around my neck . Be my breath , there's nothing I wouldn't give . 
I cross my heart & promise to give all I got to give to make all your dreams come true . 
half days are stupid , i'm still waking up early , might as well have the whole day or not come at all . 
Now I'm drowning in the flood I made . Well explain myself to me on the other side . I'll watch from Heaven when I die . 
Adopt-A-Road Clean Up :D 
El veneno < PROPFEMALE > de tu encanto , es la llama que me va quemando . La miel de tu ternura , la razon de mi locura . 
Brand New is perfect for a day like this ...

There's nothing wrong with being lost :) 
On my way to Canada :) 
Your lungs have failed and they both stopped breathing . \ 
My heart is dead , it's way past beating . \ 
Something has gone terribly wrong , \ 
I'm scared you're scared , we're scared of this . \ 
I never thought we'd make it out alive , \ 
I never told you , but it's all in your good-byes . \ 
It's all in your goodbyes . 
Red Hot Chili Peppers & sweats kinda mood :) 
Am I the only one who isn't happy about the snowday ? 
How I wish you were here ... We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl , year after year . 
Forever , your eyes will hold the memory . I saw your heart as it overtook me . We tried so hard to understand and reason , but in the one moment I gave my heart away . 
Cause you're the only song I want to hear , a < PROPFEMALE > softly soaring through my atmosphere . 
My first thought waking up this morning was that today was going to be awful , but it actually turned out to be great :) 
I just hated this afternoon and it's gloominess . I will go to sleep and hope that tomorrow is less irritating , even though I have to wake up extremely early . 
I could be home warm under my blankets , drinking coffee and watching TV . Instead , I'm hungry at the airport in < PROPMALE > waiting for my unpunctual father . So much for wanting to get out of Michigan . 
Aerodrone's \Ready To Love\ " is addicting :) " 
I'm feeling so much better now , my hair's jet black and in my eyes . 
Tron was a good movie , now I want one of those sexy suits . 
Why does this always happen to me ? : I enter a public restroom , think nobody is there and start to sing . Then I realize someone was there :/ 
I'm in love with a DJ , he plays a song that gets me on the dance floor . I download it when I get home , it goes something , something like . .. 
Hold me like an air guitar , run your fingers up my neck and play . It's magic , yes it's magic to me . 
I want < PROPFIRST > Cusack holding a boombox outside my window . I want < PROPMALE > from Sixteen Candles waiting outside the church for me . Just once I want my life to be like an 80's movie , preferably one with a really awesome musical number for no apparent reason . 
I was made for loving you baby , you were made for loving me . I can't get enough of you baby , can you get enough of me ? 
And I will meet you after the show in the parking lot next to the Super 8 Motel 
threw a wink at the DJ and he played that Daft Punk & you tore my heart out 
To me you're perfect , and my wasted heart will love you <3 
Thank you 27 Dresses , now < PROPFIRST > & The Jets will be stuck in my head for the next 24 hours . 
I love having a headache and running around the airport in heels because I'm late , then finding out the flight is ... a couple hours delayed . Oh yeah and that there's Listerine and < PROPFEMALE > Syrup all over my purse . FML 
What's in your head , in your head zombie , zombie , zombie ? 
For some odd reason , winter brings out the R&B in me :/ haha 
Me : can I sleep with you ? \ 
Mom : right right , turn off the lights\ 
Me : what ? \ 
Mom : ahhh ha , you know what it is\ 
Me : why are you singing to me ? \ 
Mom : cause you are the only exception\ 
Me : uhh , stop listening to 955 ! 
I just printed the dumbest story I've ever written in my life . I hope the teacher doesn't think I'm a sickly minded child . 
Even though he's 68 , I'd still marry < PROPFIRST > McCartney . 
spent an amazing needed time with my sweet thang < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > :D 
It is a very difficult spot we live in . But if there's one thing to < PROPFEMALE > the two of us and keep us strong . It's not the fact of being loved by you . But being privileged enough to be able to love you . That will always keep me right here by you . - < PROPFIRST > Tisdall 
Bright are the stars that shine\ 
Dark is the sky\ 
I know this love of mine\ 
Will never die\ 
And I love her 
Ok , maybe being a vegetarian in a mexican family isn't going to work :/ 
And when I touch you I feel happy inside . It's such a feeling that my love , I can't hideee ? 
Other dancers may be on the floor\ 
Dear , but my eyes will see only you\ 
Only you have that magic technique\ 
When we sway I go weak <3
