Explanation - I haven't been , nor will be , online often because my Dad works from home a lot of the time , I don't want to access Facebook from work ( security stuff ) , and my life is crazy busy . Miss everyone I haven't seen recently ! 

Well that was an interesting * achem * adventure .... 
leaves Colorado ( cry ) for < PROPFEMALE > ( horray ) on Sunday ! 
Made it ... alive ... sort of ... 
will have a great time , tortured granted , in debate ... VERY interesting people . I fit right in ! 
LOVES debate ! I'm so psyched about the topic and the argument style and the new lingo and and and EVERYTHING ! 
Debate people spread the info - < PROPFEMALE > Debate 2009 Institute FB group . 
Wait ... < PROPFEMALE > Debate Institute 2009 ... I got it backwards , sorry . 
Loves < PROPFEMALE > ! Especially convo .... Caner is awesome ! ( Add inflection ) 
is tired and excited for friends to get in tomorrow . Wow , hit school running , that's for sure ! 
loves < PROPMALE > Grey tea , friends , < PROPFEMALE > especially , and < PROPFEMALE > . God is good . ( Humidity sucks , though ) . 
My head hurts - its too smart for my own sanity ! 
has become nocturnal . 
is going to Jujitsu and Tae Kwon Do back to back tonight - about time for Martial Arts ! 
is 4 and 0 at GSU debate tournament ! 
is excited about Clarion ! Pray for < PROPFEMALE > debate ! 
has decided that this weather could not be more beautiful ... for < PROPFEMALE > , that is . 
loves Richmond University campus - absolutely beautiful ! Fun debates , too . 
desperately needs to turn debate off from the mind ! Too much ! 
is bored of her profile picture ... I want a cool martial arts one like < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > ! 
so many pictures ! Busy busy doing admin for < PROPFEMALE > TKD . Enjoy ! 
CRAZY FROG ! Stuck in my head because of the rediculous little ninja .... 
Sigh . Life is so busy ! Then again I wouldn't have it any other way ... 
masochistic martial artist in a meloncholy mood ... poor Lenn . 
sigh . Surrounded by good friends , fascinating classes and a whirlwind of stress . So time for a break , ( Thank you God for Thanksgiving ! ) but life is how it should be . 
going home soon !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
HOME ! 
Snow ! 
FREEDOM !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
has discovered she is scared for life ... she will never be able to brush her teeth with anything other than her left hand ! 
mischevous . 
Is honored to be part of the < PROPFEMALE > debate family - and very proud of them ! 
SNOW ! I'm going to start wearing snowflake jewelry more often ... :D Coloradan is happy . 
pH - really ?! We're ' learning'pH! * Weeps in boredom * 
snow . * Far away expression of absolute joy * 
I have decided that if you are bored and don't have to schedule study time around friends , you need more awesome friends . 
lost at hearts , but Lenn Lund didn't win , so its all ok ! 
loves working in the Psych department with < PROPFEMALE > Yoshino ... we've found our true home ! 
God works for the good of those who love him , who have been called according to his purpose - especially with snow days ! 
ok , so I have to admit something that shocked me - < PROPFEMALE > weather impressed me ! The snow has a wonderfully mystical sheet of ice on top of it , an absolutely fascinating phenomenon to the Coloradan ..... What wonders associated with the frozen liquid we so take for granted . 
will be working on nuclear necromancy for the next many weeks , probably to the detriment of extensive scholastics . 
just played key board . :: Grin of bliss :: How frustrating ! It sounds terrible , feels terrible , and makes me homesick - and it was so awesome ! < PROPFEMALE > Yoshino made my week , at least ! 
has missed martial arts in the extreme ! 
Random fun quote of the day : \the medical people in this group are going to have melancholy heart attacks at impossible maladies . \"" 
My life really doesn't vary that much - homework , masochism ( either due to debate or martial arts ) , and attempts at sleep . Then there's the friends : they make the world spin round . 
Thought : life could be boiled down to moment by moment healing , in any number of forms , and we either help or harm that healing . College doesn't really condone health . 
Absolutely hates growing up . 
is praying for Adare Discher . 
adores her friends ! 
Oh my goodness , convicting melancholy quote ! \Worry does not empty tomorrow of its sorrow ; it empties today of its strength . \ " - < PROPFEMALE > Ten Boom " 
Loves Hebrews 6:7 ... a message for college students . 
has decided she adores the breeze ! The gentle play on the hair , the sound of the rustling in trees , pulling the drying helicopters along the sidewalk , cooling the scorching heat from the sun all sum to a promise of a moment of peace in contrast to the sounds of planes overhead , construction in the distance , stressed college students bustling from one air-conditioned class to the next . 
is in a ' wondering ' mood ... 
LOVES three part staff ! 
stuffed her head too full of information . Now the brain is holding it all captive until it receives sleep and a vacation - neither of which can be granted before teachers demand the information regurgitated on their tests . Ug . 
TWO WEEKS AND I'M HOME ! 
1 < PROPFIRST > 4:7 -11 ~ \The end of all things is near ... \"" 
YEAY ! Super excited ! Pandora just stumbled upon one of my favorite all time theme songs ever : Lux Aeterna ! 
Me : \Maybe I'm just a freak . \ " < PROPFEMALE > Yoshino : \ " I thought this was already a forgone conclusion . \"" 
I would love to talk to you until kingdom come ... but I guess we can just talk for eternity after that . 
loves her dear stalker mom , Babs St ! Praying for recovery and can't wait to see you ! 
Wow ! Forgot I had so much fun stuff in my boxes ... Stalker Mom sent more than I realized ! 
Apathy is strong with this one . 
DONE ! Praise the Lord ! :: Weeps with joy :: 
:: Tomorrow , tomorrow , I'll see you tomorrow ! ::

Snow is melted ! Off to play in the dirt ! I don't need a college education to garden ... why in the world am I in school ?!!? 
loves rocks !

Farewell Colorado ... I shall return to your blissful slopes soon , yet never soon enough . 
HOME ! Yeay ! Please don't make me go on any more vacations ! 
I believe that contentment is the most illusive and precious thing in life . Only through the grace of God can it be attained .

question of the ages : pirates or ninjas ?

a college education prepares you for : cheating at cards and digging ditches . 
Farewell , my beautiful state ! I shall miss you as I travel into land of humidity and heat , leaving behind the engineers and authors ... oooooh ! Sadistic philosophic psychologists ! 
has her beads back ! Horrah ! Yeay for Babs St Stalkermom packages !

Live paradoxically - follow Jesus to the death to lead the world to life .

I now understand and rescind some of my aversion to aspects of phlegmaticism . 
One of the best quotes of our room ever : \What are you two talking about ? You sound like PhDs ! \"" 
Ackh ! Stressed . 
The only things in the world worth updating facebook statuses for are < PROPFEMALE > Yoshino quotes ...
