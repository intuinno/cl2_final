While waiting for the hours to pass and time to start slowly tick away , bleeding ticks from the dying clock while the young man grows older by the minute .

I feel your gaze over my shoulder ; And I match your disappointment ; You say there's nothing I can do ; But you can prevent me from trying . \ 
I can't stop thinking about this ; Such a sad , sad situation ; Just as we started to take off ; We've fallen into accusation ... 
Lay your head down child ; I won't let the Boogeyman come ; Counting Bodies like sheep to the rhythm of the war drums ; Pay no mind to the rabble ; Pay no mind to the rabble ; Head down , go to sleep to the rhythm of the war drums -('Pet ' by A Perfect Circle ) 
Really tired . Doing a resume for Deines . FML on this college statement ! 
I love how much time is left to < PROPFEMALE > with people in school , but I love how much time I can spend with my family . I LOVE YOU GIMPY !!!! <3 
My college statement is SO horrible that if I gave my dogs permission to eat it , they would not even try because it is a crock of shit ... unless it was smothered in peanut butter . 
just got back from school . -sigh- I love this week so much , I threw up for it and still played in games . YAY !! 
And not to pull your halo down ;\ 
Around your neck and took you to the ground ;\ 
But I'm more than just a little bit curious ;\ 
How you're planning to go about making your amends to the dead ;\ 
With your halo slipping down ;\ 
Your halo slipping ;\ 
Your halo slipping down ;\ 
Your halo slipping down to choke you now . \

I feel that every day i just grow more and more nice , but creepier as things go on . Someone tell me the truth about me . What am I ??? 
It takes alot of time to get over someone you deeply care about , but I understand that I have to move on . I cannot let the things I used to love pull me down . As long as I can keep them as friends , then I'm okay , because I know I'm not alone . I have to keep my head high , and think of her as just a friend . Hopefully , I can find the true one for me , but for now , the word \Single\ " is branded into my forehead . "

Dying without her in my arms . Going a minute without someone is murder , going a week without the most wonderful person you love is genocide . I miss her more than anything and I'd give anything to be with her for the rest of my life . <3 Evan&Crystel <3

Idk why my family has to be at each other's throats . I just wish things were like they should be in the past ? where we used to laugh and have fun conversations ? where were the times when we used to just BE a family ? I can tell you the truth I miss those days . All the laughing and playing is now a distant memory , withering in dust and broken memories . I just wish things were better .

NOTE : Cousin shoveling snow off the lake tells you not to go to the other end because it isnt thick enough to walk on : listen to him . [ I fell in and taught myself how to swim XD ] Call me a dumbass , but I was more calm than a freshman first swimming in Developmental Rec . [ I.e. ME ! XD ]
