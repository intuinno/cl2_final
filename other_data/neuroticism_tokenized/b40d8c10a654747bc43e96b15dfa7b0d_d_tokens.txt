God's eternal purpose is to have a people that would express Him . The way He fulfills this purpose is called His economy . In His economy , God as the Spirit dispenses Himself into man , God is able to dispense Himself into man because He is the Spirit and man has a spirit . The Spirit transmits the entire Triune God , and the human spirit receives this transmission . 
Do all things without murmurings and reasonings\ 
Philippians 2:14 
Exercise unto godliness . For bodily exercise is profitable for a little , but godliness is profitable for all things , having promise of the present life and of that which is to come . \

But an hour is coming , and it is now , when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truthfulness , for the Gather also seeks such to worship Him . God is Spirit , and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness . \ 
~ John 4:23 -24 
But a soulish man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God , for they are foolishness to him and he is not able to know them because they are discerned spiritually . But the spiritual man discerns all things , but he himself is discerned be no one . \ 
~ 1 1orinthians 2:14 -15 
That which is born of the flesh is flesh , and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit . \ 
~ John 3:6 
The burden of the word of Jehovah concerning < PROPMALE > . Thus declares Jehovah , who stretches forth the heavens and lays the foundations of the earth and forms the spirit of man within him . \ 
~ Zechariah 12:1 
Didn't < PROPFIRST > Fan have a facebook ? 
If we would love the Lord\ 
and care for His unique body , \ 
the Lord would pour Himself out \ 
and move within us as\ 
the Seven-fold Intensified Spirit\ 
to blend us together\

of the New Jerusalem . 
O Jehovah , in the morning\ 
You will hear my voice ;\ 
In the morning I will set forth my words in order to You , \ 
And I will watch . \

The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God . \ 
~ Romans 8:16
