I am so happy right now . I'm very relieved . I'm ready for tomorrow :) I'm ready for this week . I'm hoping this week is great ^.^ 

I'm not sure what to do . It's a tough decision ! 
Blargh I'm so frustrated 
TIME TO DANCE ! * dance * :D ^.^ 
So . I forgot what the link was for the take home part of the test in English >.> for Mr. Doebler * So .. If anyone has it , feel free to help me out here :) 
It's not like worth half of the test or anything ... >.> I need help ! I can't find the link or whatever :( or the instructions ! 
I want to scream . Until no sound comes out and you learn your lesson . I want to swallow these pills to get to sleep so I don't have to make a bad impression . 
Under the water ! \

I feel sick . 
Making people say woah . That fool puts on a show . 
Actually . Sometimes ... I feel like I'm NOT the only one in this ... If there's someone I'm not being told about . Maybe it's just my mind playing tricks on me . Who knows . * shrug * :/ 
I just ordered ... the best pizza ever . :D 
I feel like dirt . As in , i feel worthless . I don't know why i'm feeling this way . I think if i left the world wouldn't miss me . This is what is running through my mind .
