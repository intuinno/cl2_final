you never truly realize how disturbing childrens ' programs can be until you babysit ! 
is willing to bet the insurance people the Mythbusters use have a person devoted full-time just to them ! 
daily < PROPFEMALE > Gaughn quote : \What country is consistently rated first in health quality indicators ?... It's those cheese-eating surrender monkeys !! France !!! \"" 
the Canadian Cow won the Happy California Cow Contest !!!! YEEEEEAAAAAHHH !!!!! 
Why is everyone getting snow ( or wintry weather ) but meeeee ?! T.T 
R.I.P. Union pen ... this is the third pen I've killed this school year !! I used to think pens lasted forever ! Imagine my surprise when I turn into a pen serial killer ! 
wishes she could swallow listerine .... that would kill the germy buggers that seem to be invading my throat !!

can't believe it , snow in < PROPFEMALE > , who'da thunk ?! Very exciting though !

wishes she wasn't so paranoid .... she's also a bit anal .... wishes that would go away too .... 
has figured out one of the most frustrating things on this planet -- when you're writing a paper and you think of something GREAT , but before you can actually write/type it , it goes away and leave you there ... sitting ... staring ... trying desperately to remember ....

watched Pocahontas ... I feel so bad for Kocoum every time ! Ya know , technically < PROPFIRST > Smith was hedging in on his woman ! Can't really blame him for being a < PROPMALE > upset ! 
* sigh * You think people would've learned by now that messing with the time-space continuum is a BAD IDEA ! ALWAYS ! No exceptions !! Sheesh , get it through your head people !! 
At this moment , < PROPMALE > Poelvoorde , I hate your soul and curse your memory !! 
Why does rain make me soooo ...... sleeepy ...... 
perfect score on my ethics paper on eugenics baby ! Yeah !!!! 
R.I.P. < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . Perhaps now you will find out what < PROPMALE > was talking about . 
' Tis my considered opinion that ' tis better to have a small but enthusiastic group of students that really want to learn than to have a large , but uninspired group that is just there for the food ( or some other reward ) . 
Just beat Dragon Age Origins for the first time !!! * fist pump of victory * What a rush !!!! ............ Now let's play again !!! WOOT !!!! Look out Zevran !! 
Dear obnoxious person at the red light , if my car is vibrating because of your music and you're a couple of cars behind me , it is too loud . You are going to end up being one of those little old men who can't hear thunder and goes around saying \eh ?! eh ?! \ " all the time . Just saying . Kthxbye . " 
Shoot ... stupid body ... how dare you succumb to a virus ! How could you do this to meeee ?! 
Blonde Moment #24671 : UGAmail switched servers & I was admiring the new layout when I look in the bottom left corner & see a BioWare Logo ( an amazing video game company ) . I think , \Woah ! They got BioWare to do their email ?! AWESOME ! \ " It takes me 3 hours to realize that my Firefox personality is Dragon Age ( a BioWare game ); the logo's there all the time . BioWare does NOT do email ... " 
if I could be a polymer , I AM Polyvinyl chloride ! 
is going to learn to drive a stick shift , even if it kills her AND her father !!! 
THE JHC HRSA 330 < PROPMALE > BPR IS OFFICIALLY SUBMITTED !!!! HALLELUJAH !!!! * happy dance , then sits down and cries * 
officially has a very nervous little bird in residence in her apartment . But we make progress , slowly but surely ! 
Here's wishing health , happiness , and all that other good , sappy stuff to all my loved ones ( you know who you are ! ) 
is such a dork sometimes- I walk in time whatever's playing on my iPod , which means I'm practically running at times & doing a really cool saunter at others ! 
Advice to the world , when you have a bird and like to play computer games , SAVE OFTEN !!!!!!!!!! 
When in doubt , jerk the battery out ! ^_^ 
feels a true sense of accomplishment , she played the role of nurse during < PROPFEMALE>'s car surgery and guess what , we fixed it all by ourselves ! Boo yah ! 
thinks it's really funny how many ninja warrior contestants build practice courses in their back yard ; why don't they work together and just build a huge practice course ? ( Oh , and in my humble opinion there is no positive correlation between building practice courses and doing better anyway ) 
Dear charter , I hate you , I curse you to the deepest , darkest abyss I can think of ! ...... Have a great day ! 
my baby bird sings a new song ... Darth Saria ! 
I like it on the floor beside the bed . 
Kudos on the logo today Google , Kudos ! 
Dear unnamed Athens politicians : I find your extensive use of black writing on red backgrounds on your campaign signs extremely insensitive to the needs of your color-vision impaired constituents . If you want to get elected , be sure the voter can read your name ! :P 
You\ 
and I wake up in jail together ! Using only FOUR words , what would you \ 
say to me ? Leave me a comment ... then copy and paste this in your \ 
status and see what funny things your friends say . ( And if you make a \ 
comment , you should put this in your status ... fair is fair ! ) 
Evil is a guy on a zebra . 
Thinks it's time for some screamo therapy - Rammenstein and Arch Enemy , take me away ! 
RiffTrax in the movie theaters = AWESOME !!!!!!!!! 
thinks < PROPFEMALE > and Heathcliff are definitely the poster children for UNHEALTHY relationships ! 
Let it be henceforth proclaimed to the facebook world , a new movie ( miniseries ) has joined the ranks of what I consider to be the best movies EVAR - namely BBC's North & South * gush * XD 
marry me < PROPFIRST > Armitage , 15 years isn't THAT much of an age difference ! With love we can overcome it !!!!! :3 
Heaven is like life with really great mods . 
Feliz < PROPFEMALE > de Gracias ya'll!! 
Am I the only one who feels awful for the guy who DOESN'T get the girl ?! Those poor saps that are left at the end of the show/movie with their poor hearts shattered into a million pieces while the girl goes running off with the hero into the sunset - and they're often laughing to boot !! Poor pitiable guys ! 
BWAHAHAHA ! < PROPFIRST > Tennant in a BBC period drama ! A CLERGYMAN !!! Oh , my heart is happy ! You rock , Doctor ! 
A true friend doesn't care when you're broke , being a b **** , what you weigh , if\ 
your house is a mess , what you drive , about your past , or if your family is filled with crazy people . Your conversations pick up where they left off , even if they have been months apart . They love you for who you are . Re-post if you have at least one true friend . They will know who they are ! 
Wants to take time to thank everyone for their generous birthday wishes ! I had a great day and I'd also like to announce that my super brother gave me my very own copy of BBC's North & South ! WOOOT !!!! * happy dance * 
So , baby bird had an adventure today - took her this morning to get her nails trimmed ( they were pretty sharp ) , but the man cut them too short ( being used to trimming dog nails ) & so all her nails ended up bleeding - 1 profusely . We couldn't stop the bleeding ourselves & had to take her to animal intensive care . They stopped the bleeding & now she is resting in her cage . She's still owie and very mad at me now .... 
Thought I'd throw in a last resounding \Merry Christmas ! \ " before passing out . " 
Just beat DA Awakening for the first time - that made my brain hurt ! >.< And Neria got to spend the rest of her life with her true love Alistair by her side in the epilogue ! :D ( He came back - the bum !! He doubtless got punched in the face before he was forgiven !! ) 
Just a friendly reminder to those about to get snow- remember to get your potato chips , cookies and ice cream . I've got mine ! where's yours ? 
My class tonight has been cancelled ! That makes my first official week of classes of my final semester cancelled ! * Naga laugh * 
Dear Restaurant City , I've had lots of fun playing your game & I've constantly annoyed my friends with your requests & wall-posts . However , I must say that I'm really starting to get fed up - everywhere I turn you want me to spend REAL money on my FAKE restaurant ! You change things too fast & I can't keep up . This latest thing with the cops just about makes me want to quit ( though Sugar Cane , lol) ! Urgh ! 
An apple a day keeps the doctor away . \ 
But if the Doctor is cute , screw the fruit !! 
Losing weight sucks . It sucks even more when you're sitting in a lunch meeting with your weight loss bar & an apple & the guy sitting next to you has a really delicious-smelling Mediterranean lunch that gives your lunch an inferiority complex T.T 
You know the smoothie's good when you get chunks of fruit in the straw ! :D 
So , in this Super Bowl ( insert number here ) , I am rooting for the Green Bay Packers . Why ? So I can yell in my best guttural man voice - \PACKERS !!!!! \ " :P No reason beyond that I'm afraid . " 
So , in the midst of all the Happy < PROPFIRST>'s day statuses and wonderful comments about significant others , I feel it my duty to represent the other side . For those of you in a lovely relationship , I'm happy for you and imma let you finish , but do remember those of us that are chronically single and try not to rub our faces in it too much , ' < PROPFEMALE > ? Thanks ! ;) Have a great Single's Awareness Day !! 
Victory is making a really tasty dinner where you can eat a perfect amount and still be under 400 calories ! AH HAHAHAHAHAHAHA ! 
* in the tone of < PROPMALE > Jenkins * ZEVRAAAAAAAN ARAINAI !!!!!!!! 
* happy dance * 16 lbs lost so far !!!! skinny girls step aside !!!!! :D 
What a shame , Eanin doesn't like Apocalyptica ..... 
thinks she should get extra points for head shots in Snowball Fight on Wii Fit . 
is clearly not normal- I read about people fearing to be labeled as a ' geek ' or ' nerd ' & so they play dumb & don't live up to their true potential . Hey , the label's never bothered me ! Nerds have more fun in life ! Embrace your inner geek everyone ! 
You know the singing in church is good when you have a hard time singing past the lump in your throat . 
* stands really awkwardly at midnight game release*ho hum .... * whistles * .... what do people DO at these things ?! Just gimme my dad gum game !!!! 
MINE !!!!!!!! IT'S MIIIIIIIIIIINE !!!!! AAAAAAAALL MIIIIIIINNNNNEEEEE !!!!! BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA !!!!! 
You know , no matter how many hundreds of times I've listened to the < PROPMALE>'s Singer's Barber of Seville Overture , it never fails to make me giggle ! :) I look pretty funny listening to/singing it at the bus stop ! 
Beannachtaí Lá Fhéile Phádraig agaibh ! 
If you're in some trouble/hostage situation and you're trying to hide something , rule number 1- DON'T look at the place where you're hiding it !! 
Movie review time ! The Movie : My Name is Khan . This is such a good movie ! I highly recommend it ! I laughed , I cried ( I know , me crying during a movie , craziness ! ) , it moved me . It reminded me of just how stupid it is to blame and take action against an entire race/group for the actions of a few . Hatred never solves anything , but we never seem to learn and we have to keep being reminded of this simple concept . 
Notice : The person you have dialed has officially lost her mind - or rather comps have eaten it . Don't even try to find her before 1 PM on Friday , because she is lost , gone and a nervous wreck . She still loves you , but has no more room in her brain for anything else . That is all . 
Profile Pic = current video game character that I wish with all my heart was real ! Though if he was , < PROPFEMALE > , I wouldn't stand a < PROPMALE > ! * siiiiiiiiigh * 
My bird is nuts about Pringles ... almost as much as she loves popcorn ... huh ... 
So , passed comps AND got my FREE copy of Mass Effect 2 . * deep voice * This is indeed a blessed day . ;P 
Well well well , Osama bin Laden is dead ... It's wrong to rejoice in any death , it's true , but one cannot help but feel a < PROPFEMALE > sense of satisfaction at finally finding the guy we've been looking for almost ten years , and we got him ! (* fist pump *) that's just human nature . * demure * but of course , we can now have brighter hope for future peace efforts as one figurehead has been removed , so that's good in any case . 
So this is what it's like to experience disappointment so profound you could choke ... didn't even know it was there ... 
Feliz Cinco de Mayo ustedes !!! 
Today I celebrate Cinco de Mayo AND my heritage by eating a dinner of a quesadilla ... made with Munster and Dubliner cheese ! :D 
Important Lesson : Don't be afraid of the strong young warrior , he may be loud , but he gets beaten ; it's the wizened ( often little ) old man who looks like he can't walk ( much less fight ) who should scare the crap out of you ! 
Eanin seems to have taken a liking to landing on my FACE ...... any time I < PROPFEMALE > back to gather a thought , there's a bird , on my face ! 
* braveheart yell * ACADEMIC FREEDOM !!!!!!!!! 
is now officially a Master of Public Administration . I shall now insist on being addressed as such ! ;P 
So , has anyone been taken up yet ? Anyone ? 
2 things :\ 
1 . I feel so loved and grateful ! Fanning is keeping me on for another month ! A reprieve ! * sniff * You like me ! You really like me !! \ 
2 . I'm kinda looking for something to do for Memorial Day ... whether it be the weekend or just the day ... something that doesn't involve lots of driving , a cookout would do ! Any ideas ? 
I really should work on my zombie apocalypse plan ... it is a bit underdeveloped . I advocate the use of a machete - it doesn't run out of bullets like a gun or gas like a chainsaw , both of which could be hard to find in the post-zombie apocalypse world ... \ 
Have YOU prepared your zombie apocalypse plan ? 
You know you're a dorky office worker when you find a new box of pens in the supply cabinet and your immediate response is \Score ! Nice Pen ! I got the first one ! Yatta ! \"" 
I feel loved ! :3 
Feliz < PROPFEMALE > de los Padres !!! 
AC is fixed ! I can live again ! Now about that packing .... 
Something I've never understood- why on earth do companies put previews for a movie/tv show that you're already watching on dvd . But I bought the dvd ! you don't have to convince me ! 
Every time I see < PROPFIRST > Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield , I cry a little . Naturally , as a loyal fan I know that he will do splendidly in the role , because he's just that good , but , but , how can they do that to my eye < PROPFEMALE > man ?!? * sob * 
It is done , ladies and germs !!! The baby batman hat is finally completed !!!!!!! * happy dance * 
5 DEADLY TERMS USED BY A WOMAN ! ( 1 ) FINE : This is the word women use to end an argument when she knows she is right and you need to shut-up . ( 2 ) NOTHING : means something & you need to be worried . ( 3 ) GO AHEAD : this is a dare , not permission , do not do it . ( 4 ) WHATEVER : A woman's way of saying screw you . ( 5 ) THAT'S OK : She is thinking long & hard on how and when you will pay for your mistake . Re-post if you agree 
Phone Interview at 2 . * deep breath * I can do this ... I am prepared ... Relax ... be myself ... ohmygoshIwantthisjobscratchthatIjustwantAjob ! Send all your positive energy and prayers my way ! 
Attention everyone ! So , in the way of technology whenever you really need it , my phone has decided to stop working on me !! I mean , it works , but just none of the buttons respond , so if you send me a text message or a voice mail or an email , I can't check it , I can only answer a call through bluetooth if I catch you at the time of the call ! Ugh ! I only need this phone to last me until I get a job ! T T.T T 
Ok , got a new phone ! Same number , so peeps can reach , me again ! 
I hypothesize that the enjoyment of one's shower is positively correlated to how dirty one feels . 
So , I finally saw the last < PROPMALE > Potter and yes , I cried . Snape's memories , man - I cried while reading them in the book ! How could I NOT cry during the movie ?! 
Just when I utterly despair over our society and think I just can't live in this world anymore , I get 20 free books online from Barnes and < PROPMALE > and Google , which I can then instantly sync and read from my phone ! Books ! Lots of them ! ON . MY . PHONE ! For Free ! I can now read EVEN MORE books at once !!! This world is an amazing place !!!! :D
