If you find your fists are raw and red from beating yourself down\ 
If your legs have given out under the weight\ 
If you find that you've been settling for a world of gray\

The North < PROPFEMALE > House of Representatives passed a proposed referendum for the primary elections in May of 2012 . If this referendum is passed , the state’s ban on gay marriage will be made a part of our constitution , making it nearly impossible for the ban to ever be overturned . Repost this , get the word out and if you are of age , vote in the May 2012 primary . We have to show our government that we do NOT want hate and bigotry in our constitution .
