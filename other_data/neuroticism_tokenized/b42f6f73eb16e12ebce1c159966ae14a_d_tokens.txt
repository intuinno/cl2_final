Change your FB profile picture to a cartoon from your childhood . The Goal ? To not see a human face on FB until Monday , December 6th . Join the fight AGAINST Child Abuse and copy & paste to your status to invite your friends to do the same . \

Join the fight against bitch ass fools who do wrong to kids 
I'm getting old , i'm ready for the new year . New Year means New Beginning . I'm so ready to get this New Years resolution underway . 
Their are a lot of horrible drivers at night . 
Had some good food , but slow service , took 30+ mins to get the food . 
Wondering where my car is ? 
Cowboys won , plus got some of my Christmas shopping done . 
Kids with special needs aren't sick or gross or stupid , and their handicap is not contagious . They only want what we all want , to be accepted and loved . Can I make a request ? Is anyone willing to post this and leave itas your status for at least an hour ? This is in honor of ALL children who were born in a unique and loving way .. 
ATTENTION : Itwas brought my attention that the group asking everyone to change theirprofile picture to a cartoon character is actually a group of pedophiles . There doing it because kidswill accept their friend request faster if they see a cartoon picture . It has nothing to do with any Child charities . IT'S ON TONIGHTS NEWS ... So change your picture back please . 
Wish i knew why people act the way they did . 
Whats up with all these < PROPFIRST > ? 
lately been having weird dreams 
A good birthday nite . Got to watch 2 live fights . One being a UFC ( so glad Koscheck got pummeled ) and another was a bar fight ( didn't actually see it but saw somewhat of a brawl . ) 
A great weekend , cant wait til next weekend 
Not ready for work .

Lets see what work has in store for me today .

so tired , only 3 and a half hours of sleep 
5 Days til Christmas . 
I HATE the Walmart in riverside , it is so ghetto . 
If you don't see me on for long periods of time , its because i am without a charger . I broke it about 2 weeks ago , so as of right now i'm on borrowed time . 
Grandma got runned over by a reindeer . Does anyone know who sings this song ? 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas to all and all a g'nite! 
Is buying a internet tv a bad investment ? I don't think so it will save me money from buying a desk , desktop cp and what not .

I'm back in business . I got a new laptop charger .

I am not superstitious but this year July has 5 Fridays , 5 Saturdays , and 5 Sundays . This happens once every 823 years . This is called money bags . So copy and paste this to your staus and money will arrive within 4 days . Based on Chinese Feng Shui . The one that does not copy ... will be with out money . I cannot let that person be ME ! Who can argue with Chinese Feng Shui ??? 
I need to start looking for another quote to replace the one i already use .

Sometimes you need a drink before you goto work , just to make things better .

I wish everyday was the weekend 
The Girl you just called fat ? She has been starving herself & has lost over 30lbs . The Boy you just called stupid ? He has a learning disability & studies over 4hrs . a night . The Girl you just called ugly ? She spends hours putting on makeup hoping people will like her . The Boy you just tripped ? He is abused at home . There's a lot more to people than you think . Put this as your status if you're against bullying !!

Its so unsafe to drive down a freeway with no seatbelt and no brakes going 50 mph , but i did . 
Damn this is the real first time i'm watching a basketball game and cheering for the Mavs . 
I think i'm lucky majority of the time in life . 
damn i found a trunk lid for my car but no monieees . 
It has been said that everlasting friends go long periods of time without speaking and never question the friendship . These friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been or how far away they live , and they don't hold grudges . They understand that life is busy and you will ALWAYS love them . Re-post if you have at least 1 of these friends . They will know who they are :) 
After today just 1 more day and than I will begin the weekend . 
Just sold my rims , so the pics will come down after i get off of work . 
I have a lot of work ahead of me saturday and can't wait to get the car moving again 
My brother asked me a question earlier today , saying if i died today who would get my impala . I told him my dad , and than my dad looked at me and said if its running . I told him he's wrong , but he told me it will be sitting if i gave it to him as is . 
dayum , why am i attracted to women that have seductive eyes . I melt in their hands . 
Just a lil over 3 hrs of hel .... er i mean work left . 
Aaahh , wish i had some money to get this trunk lid . Anybody want to help a poor mesican out ? All donations will be used for a better cause . ;) 
I had a dream that 2 people that use to work at ATC for the longest came back to work their again . Weird .

Its finally friday , hope this day goes by fast . 
Watching Grown Ups 
Well my car might have to wait before i can put it in the shop . 
I shouldn't have taken a nap for like 5 or so hrs , but i was tired . 
I hope they are able to get these wildfires under control . The yr of 2011 has been a awful year for the world . 
It should be sometime after may when i get my car in the shop . Also i have to hit up the junk yards this saturday . It's going to be a busy weekend . 
Theres nothing like fresh paint in the morning to keep you going . 
So the weekend begins , sadly it begins with the dentist later today . 
Rescheduled my dentist app . and bought some things for me car . 
Filled my tummy up with some mole . 
I'm glad i'm not at work . 
At the dentist office waiting for it to open . 
Got back from the dentist feeling better . 
I hate taking pills of any kind . 
As long as i keep my mind focused , i don't have to think about the b.s. at work . 
Dilemma on money . What to do ? No i'm not giving it away . 
Need some sleep . 
I don't want to have to work tomorrow . 
I'm tired and if i had a choice i wouldn't work today , but i have to . I need the money . 
Overall a good day , i thought it was going to be crappy , but it was good . 
Its thursday , and i finished mulling things over . 
If i win the texas lotto i will be satisfied . 
Going home to dope myself up . Nothing like self medicating urself . 
So much to do when i wake up later today . 
This year July has 5 Fridays 5 Saturdays and 5 Sundays . This happens once every 823 years . This is called money bags . So copy this to your status and money will arrive within 4 days . Based on Chinese philosophy of Feng Shui . Those who read and do not copy will be without money :))))) try it , it won't hurt u ... 
I bought me some black 68 plates and 2 side view mirrors for it as well . 
Overall a good weekend , but now back to work . 
I kno most people dont want to hear this , but i want to work saturday . I need the $$$ 
I'm ready to sleep . 
First time in a while i've been fully on . My bro is using the cp for work . 
Wish people would stop drinking my liquor . Yes that means you .

Damn i dropped my laptop for like the millionth time , i think its time i buy me a new one . 
Had to get a new laptop , seeing as my old one is basically going down the shitter . Its hanging on by a thread .
