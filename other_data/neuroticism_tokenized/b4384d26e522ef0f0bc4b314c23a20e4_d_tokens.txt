No matter how big a nation is , it is no stronger than its weakest people , and as long as you keep a person down , some part of you has to be down there to hold him down , so it means you cannot soar as you might otherwise . --- Marian < PROPMALE > ( American contralto , 1897-1993 ) 
Sometimes the cost of the friendship is so high that it's just better to let go . Friendship should be freely given ; not come with an expense account . -- Me

We are very quickly entering a world where the difference between fantasy and reality is difficult or impossible to distinguish .

Self-acceptance comes from meeting life's challenges vigorously . Don't numb yourself to your trials and difficulties , nor build mental walls to exclude pain from your life .

Morning by morning I wake up to find the power and comfort of God's hand in mine .

What is real , what matters , \ 
is friends . I do not need to agree with my friends , I must only love \ 
them . This to me is the nucleus of Community ; not consensus 
What am I in the eyes of most people , a nonentity , an eccentric , or an unpleasant person -- somebody who has no position in society and will never have ; in short , the lowest of the low . All right , then - even if that were absolutely true , then I should one day like to show by my work what such an eccentric , such a nobody has in his heart . \

Men have called me mad , but the question is not yet settled , whether madness is or is not the loftiest intelligence – whether much that is glorious – whether all that is profound – does not spring from disease of thought – from moods of mind exalted at the expense of the general intellect . \

don't know what to do with her .... Heeebbbbbeeee Jeeeebbbbbeeeesss \ 
like you wouldn't believe . Probably won't be able to sleep tonight \

My landlady is hiring an exterminator to make sure all the black widows are gone . YEAH !! No more heebie jeebies ... lol 
I HATE Win Vista ... crashed again . I have my other computer up and running the internet while I search for a way to fix my BOOTMGR is missing without a Win Vista installation disc . Why they ever sell pre-installed computers without an installation DVD is beyond me ... GRRRRRR !!!!! 
I'm installing Windows 7 .... hopefully it's not near as buggy as Vista . So far Microsoft has had some , mostly decent , OS's ... but Win ME and Vista were nothing but crap . 
Hate computers .... HATE , HATE , HATE , MICROSOFT ! 
Just had my Interview with Americorp ... I think it went well !!! 
Well that's another interview that bit the dust .... :( back to the grind .

Oh , the comfort , the inexpressible comfort of feeling safe with a person ; having neither to weigh thoughts nor measure words , but to pour them all out , just as they are , chaff and grain together , knowing that a faithful hand will take and sift them , keep what is worth keeping , and then , with a breath of kindness , blow the rest away . < PROPFEMALE > Craik

I have no faith in human perfectability . I think that human exertion will have no appreciable effect upon humanity . Man is now only more active - not more happy - nor more wise , than he was 6000 years ago . < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > Poe 
I had to call an ambulance for < PROPFIRST > this morning . We spent almost 5 hours in Sacred Heart Children's Hospital . < PROPFIRST > had a seizure that lasted almost 8 < PROPFEMALE > . that partially paralyzed his right side for several hours . \

We are very happy to have her home , though . We are going to Dog pile tonight ... lol ... < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > sleeping with Mom in the Full size bed ... yeesh . 
The beauty of \spacing\ " children many years apart lies in the fact that parents have time to learn the mistakes that were made with the older ones - which permits them to make exactly the opposite mistakes with the younger ones . ~ Sydney J . < PROPMALE > " 
You do not need to be loved , not at the cost of yourself . The single relationship that is truly central and crucial in a life is the relationship to the self . Of all the people you will know in a lifetime , you are the only one you will never lose . \

Thanks to everyone who wished me a \Happy Birthday\ " ! That was great ! I wish I could have seen them on my birthday ... :( Unfortunately I twisted my ankle stepping down off the stairs and faceplanted on the sidewalk . Spent a good portion of the day in the E.R. and the rest was on the couch with my foot up . "

Every\ 
person has 1000 wishes . A cancer patient only has one : to get better . I\ 
know that 97% will not post this as their status , but I know that my \

an hour , in honor of those who died because of cancer or are still \ 
fighting it . 
< PROPFIRST > woke up to a Gran Mal this morning that lasted for 6 minutes . His Post Dictal ( sleepiness and non responding ) state lasted for an hour which is cause for concern . Please pray for him I'm concerned that his seizures are changing for the worse . 
By the time < PROPFIRST > went to bed last night his fever had gone up to 103 degrees . His Doc said to alternate motrin and tylenol which I have ... this morning he has a pretty hacky dry cough . So I'm not sure what's developed but he's got something .... lol . 
My Turkeys already done .... :( Put it in the oven last night at ( what I thought was 200 ) 250 and it's done at 7:00 a.m. .... lol 
Turkey was perfect ... < PROPFEMALE > was cranky , < PROPFEMALE > is mouthy , < PROPFIRST > is back to being healthy again , and we over stuffed ourselves . All in all a pretty perfect day . 
There will never be an equality of the sexes until women can be fat , bald and ugly and still believe they deserve a good looking man . 
For the last 3 days I've had to shovel snow that the snow plow has dropped in my driveway !!! But it's a $1000 fine if we shovel it back in the street . Fine ! I won't shovel it in the street .... I'll leave it where it is and back my car out of my driveway over and over and over until it's all in the street ! Jerks ! 
Alright Spokane drivers .... cutting in between cars that are only 2 car lengths apart at 6 a.m. on icy roads is just down right suicidal !!! Put your brain on Before you get in your cars !!

Made it home last night from Tri-Cities minus one cell phone ... Mom lost it when we pulled over the wipe the head lights . :( So I had to go online and buy a new one last night . If you tried calling and it said it was disconnected that is why . 
Our Wonderful Governor Gregoire has just cut medicaid funding so that disabled children like my son < PROPFIRST > can no longer get dental , eye-glasses , Physical , Occupational , and Speech Therapy . Thank you , Gregoire ... Now will you kindly show me how I'm supposed to pay for all that and my bills too ?

Just want to say \Hello\ " and \ " Nice meeting you\ " to my new friends on Facebook ... \ 
Alright Romney's ... Here's one for you ! I've had numerous nicknames over the years because of my name . I was wondering if you all had the same ones ? Did we all get saddled with the same ones just because our name sounded similar to something and no one could really pronounce it ? Let me know ... 
We would do better as a nation if we stopped blaming the \ills of our society\ " on single or welfare mothers and put it were it belongs .... on the deadbeat men that abandon the children they brought into this world . "
