I hate when a conflict breaks out between two of my friends and they expect me to choose a side ...... then the conflict dies down ..... then I'm in it the next time ... then we stop being friends for a awhile ... then when we're friends again we don't look at each other like we used to ... then over time our friendship dies down .... then every time you see each other you're forced to remember the good times ... 
Whereas ye know not what [ shall be ] on the morrow . For what [ is ] your life ? It is even a vapour , that appeareth for a little time , and then vanisheth away . \

I think it's suck to be a Senior in high school .... wasting over 100,000,000 ..... hours of my life just to get a freaken hand shake and a stupid piece of paper 
I think it sucks when you have a friend that you like more than a friend and you know that you can't be more than friends ... ( been there ... done that ... ain't doing it again )
