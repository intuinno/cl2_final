I miss being in school . \ 
Damn . 13 years of wanting to be out ... and now I want nothing more than to be sitting in a Computer Tech class with a bunch of nerdy guys . lol . 

Looking into posssibly getting a new guitar . Sick of all the bells and whistles on mine not working ... Quick !.. Ibanez or < PROPFIRST > ? What do you guys think ? 
Rock music is finally picking up again . A Lot of good albums coming out this year :D :D :D . 
About to watch Reign of Fire .. gosh .. I hope it doesn't suck <_< . lol . Been watching a decent stream of movies all day .. I don't need it ruined with an awful movie . lol . 
Just watched The Departed for the first time . My brain exploded . Wonderful wonderful film . New Favorite O.O 
Why the heck does it feel like my finger tips are asleep ? Extremely annoying it be <_< 
My brain has officially exploded . lol .. Discovered one of thee best and most relaxing artists I've ever heard . Vibrasphere makes my ear drums smile . lol . 
What a better to wake up in the morning than by listening to < PROPFIRST > Lynch ? LOl :) 
Could really live without having to work today . I gotta say . lol . Not really in the mood to talk to random people <_< ehhh . Keep the eye on the prize I guess ? 
Good to be home :) 
I'm starting to wonder if Pop music is starting to go back to a skanky version of 80's music . lol . >_> 
Watching more Rifftrax movies . loll . Thank you , Cat :) 
Funny how bands you used to love become so annoying as you mature . lol . There must have been something in the water when I listened to music in 9th grade . Heheh . 
So I just finished CELL by < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > and it has to be one of the best books I've ever read . Problem is .. I want to read another SK book .. but after hating Cujo , Pet Semetary , Firestarter and Salem's Lot .. I'm a little hesitant . Anyone have any suggestions of what SK book to pick up next ? 
Workety work work work . :) 
Why on earth am I still awake ? Lol . I'm tired and yet here I still sit . * shakes head * 
So take me back , back to better days . \ 
Cause this time between is wasting me away . 
Beach tomorrow with Cat , Smitty and Sammi . Pretty excited :) 
I really need to pick up my guitar and start learning again . Too bad SOMEONE snapped my string . :) 
Don't ya just hate it when you listen to a song just to laugh at it .. and then eventually you realize your starting to like the song for some reason . 
Needs to find a decent copy of What's Eating < PROPMALE > Grape . How I love that movie :) 
Politics go away . I'm tired of you . lol . 
Spent the whole day moving , cleaning , reorganizing and sneezing . lol . I'm drained . 
Almost finished reading Shutter Island .. Need a new book to read .. any suggestions ? I'm open to pretty much anything :) 
I wonder if there will ever come a day when people will stop trying to interpret me . Can't they just enjoy my company instead of trying to disect every little thing I say and do ? 
Epiphany :) Just what I've been needing :) 
Finally watching Pink < PROPMALE>'s The Wall :) 
I am one sleepy girly right now . lol . 
What a gloomy looking day outside :/ but atleast the cloud cover is making it so it's not too hot out :D 
Gooddddddd byeeeeeeeeee blueeee sky :) ;) 
Hmm .. I hate deciding what movie to watch . I've bought so many movies in the past week that I have no clue which movie to watch first :D 
Waiting for < PROPMALE > Payne to finish downloading .. lol . Haven't seen this movie in years .. :) 
I see a day of cleaning and swimming ahead of me :) 
How I love thunderstorms :) :) :) 
New < PROPFIRST > Eat World album on September 28th 0.0 Makes me happy :D 
I wanted to go swimming today : C but those clouds look like they dont want me to . Extremely large thunderheads . 
Holy goodness ... what a long day . 
You ever have one of those moments where you're just dancing horribly to music . Completely unaware that your sibling is standing right behind you . Gotta love those moments <_< :) 
Oh how I love leaving my laptop charger at < PROPFIRST>'s house . -.- lol . 
Had a nice last few days with < PROPFIRST > :) Wish it didn't have to end due to work :P 
Watching A Clockwork Orange for a second time around ... Something tells me that no matter how many times I watch this movie that my facial expression will remain the same each time . Face looks something like this o . 0 . lol . Weird weird movie . 
So tiredddd : C But I don't want to sleepppppp . 
Listening to < PROPFIRST > Eat World's new song on repeat :D :D :D :D Cant wait for their new album next month . Have < PROPFEMALE > many cds I need to add to my collection :) 
Ever have someone you hate talking to and yet you enjoy it at the same time ? Funny how some people you just cant cut out of your life .. 
Worst mistake I could have made tonight ? Clicking on the very last < PROPFEMALE > of myspace emails . lol . Found messages from December 2008 . What nostalgic hell is this ? Lol . 
My brain is too active to sleep tonight : C 
Oh how I'm going to love handing over that check to the people at the DMV . Nothing like spending several hundred dollars to register my car . :P Bye bye plump bank account . 
Trying to find the motivation to do the dishes and laundry <_< Don't wannaaaaaaa . lol . :P 
Listening to infected mushroom .. reminds me of < PROPFIRST > . Miss ya < PROPMALE > . Still can't believe you're gone . 
Hope I dont have to work tonight . Not in the mood to get yelled at by a bunch of rednecks just because I'm doing my job : Plol 
Having one of those days ... Can I go back to sleep ? Please ? 
270 question survey about tv channels .... why , god , did you allow that to be created ? lol . 
Crap .. the sleepiness is kicking in . Need some clothes pins to keep these eyes open . lol :) 
So tired but I can't go to bed because I gotta wait a few hours to take the dog out for her bathroom break . lol . She's luck I love her . -.- 
I think I just found the worst \artist\ " in the pop music industry ... o . 0 .... Kesha ... nothing like \ " Creating\ " a song where the main lyrics are quite literally \ " blah blah blah\ " .. Please god save the music industry . D: " 
Bring on the rain :D :D :D :D :D 
Bored and tired . What a terrible combination . 
Watching the butterfly effect .. 5 years ago I loved this movie .. now I'm sitting here why I bought it . lol . Weird how that happens . 
Well this is what I get for buying a used dvd ... I get a dvd that starts to skip during the last 15 minutes . 
Oh how I love not having running water . -.- 
Work tonight 4-9 .. Really don't want to go tonight . 
Lovin ' this rainnnnnn :) 
Why do I take advice from friends on movies ? Lol . Watching Cry Baby & I'm almost positive that this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen . 
I dont think there's enough hurricanes coming off the African coast . C'mon god , you can do better than that . lol . 
Just saw the trailer for the new SAW movie .. so excited now :D :D :D 
Another < PROPFEMALE > day beneath this cloudless sky . \ 
Sometimes I wish that it would rain here . \ 
And wash away the west coast dreaming from my eyes . \ 
There's nothing real for them to see here . 
Since when has Creed been back together ? Lol . News to me . 
So tired ..... but I have work at 4 : C 
Dance magic dance :) . lol . Wish I knew why I had the sudden want to watch The Labyrinth . 
Having one of those not so wonderful days . Meh . 
:) Everyday it's a-gettin ' closer\ 
Goin ' faster than a roller coaster :) 
One of the best quotes I've read in a while . \ 
\Republicans think that Democrats will tax them to the poorhouse and on the way to the poorhouse they're going to see a terrorist on the corner and as they're trying to run away from the terrorist 
So glad to be home :) 
Listening to < PROPFIRST > Eat Worlds new album ... and my brain has exploded in happiness :) 
Does anyone know how to post songs on your facebook < PROPFEMALE > without getting a mile long stream of coding ? 
Watching FernGully ... lol at the movies I used to watch as a 5 year old . :) 
Feels so nice to be out of work <3 :) 
Titanic is on TBS :-D dare I stay up till 2:30 am watching it ? :-) 
Is today over yet ? lol . 
Work got cancelled tonight :-\\ first Sunday off in a while :-) 
Just finished reading I AM LEGEND :) The last 30 pages made it worth the read ... even though I didn't really care for the rest of the book . 
My brain is tired of not thinking . It's telling me that I need to get into ITT or Devry and soon . lol . 
Attemping to read Physics of the Impossible .. so far the experience is simliar to watching paint dry . Yes . That boring . 
Oh political commercials ... please stop assailing my eyes and ears . I already am forced to repeat your political jargen at work .. I really don't need to hear it at home . Please and thank you :) 
I really need sleep and food ... <_< Am I really going to get up to do that ? Probably not . :D 
I really need to get out of this town ... even if it's only for a little while . I need something new . 
I'd love to know why the song \Rude boy\ " by Rhianna was written and recorded . lol . What a musical masterpiece -.-" 
Simple Plan needs to hurry up with their new album :D :D I wanttssss itttttttttt . lol :D 
Sometimes I hate watching The Food Channel ... Chocolate Bread Pudding ? Why must I be teased by this chocolate maddness ! :D 
I need to start playing guitar again <_< but oh do I dread replacing my strings and finding allll the tabs I had saved to my computer but lost cause my computer crashed . <_< V_V 
Oh headache .. please leave me alone . You've got my attention , I know you're there now . You can leave any time you'd like .. preferably soon . 
Biggest . Migrane . God could have ever created . lol . \ 
C'mon ... a headache from 4am on ? Fricken BS . 
Headache finally goneeeee . It only took a whole day :P 
And Maybe it's time to change\ 
And leave it all behind\ 
I've never been one to walk alone\ 
I've always been scared to try \ 
So why does it feel so wrong\ 
To reach for something more\ 
\ 
To wanna live a better life\ 
What am i waiting for ? 
Please keep my grandmother in your prayers ... just found out she's in the hospital and not doing well at all :-( 
Ugh ... the music doesn't go loud enough to block out my thoughts :-\\ 
Please keep my grandmother in your prayers ... she's still doing terribly . 
These last few days have felt so long .... waiting to see that silver lining : / 
Wish I had my drivers license .. the past couple days I've wanted nothing more than to just drive away and just attempt to clear my head : / 
Why am I down here in Florida right now ? I should be up in New York with my family ... :/ 
Id love to know why Three Days Grace finds it appropriate to sound extremely pissed off in every ... single ... fricken ... song . lol <_< 
My Granny is doing a little better but my family could still use your prayers . Her < PROPFIRST > are better but she's still on a ventilator and in the hospital . Please and thank you . 
Hm .... should I bother voting in the upcoming elections ? Cause I kinda dislike oh ... I don't know ... all the people running . lol :) 
Forgot how much I missed myspace . Maybe it's just nostalgia . lol . Too bad no one goes on myspace anymore :P 
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars ? I could really use a wish right now . 
Restarted Pc at the begining signs of a virus ... Biggest mistake EVER .... Because now when I start up my computer it just shows the < PROPFEMALE > logo and then goes to a black screen with the computer lights still on as if it's functioning . When I try to go into safe mode it shows 3 lines of script and then just hangs there and when I try to do Last Good Config it just goes to a black screen ... Help help help help help . 
So we cloned my dads hard drive to my pc and it worked .. sorta . now it won't allow both pcs on the same network because they have the same name and ids . -_- 
Computer got fixed :D 
I miss my IT class at marchman : C I need to get back to fixing & learning about computers every day . 
I hate it when they edit rap muisc to exclude the \bad words\ " -.- makes the song sound dumb <_<" 
Bad news for movie fans : They're doing a new SCREAM film . lol . You think they would have ran that plot dry by now . :) Oh well , I don't mind :) 
Something tells me that this Kid Cudi song is not going to be leaving my head anytime soon <_< lol 
Getting really tired of music censorship ... I mean c'mon .. they edit out the word \gun\ " now ? " 
Oh Mr. Sandman , Bring me a dreammmm . lol\ 
So tired . But can't sleep . 
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold ;) 
Don't make me work today & tomorrow * Pouts * Don't wannnaaaaaaaaaaaaaa . 
Say What you really feel . \ 
You know i need , \ 
Something that's real . \ 
I wish there was something inside me , \ 
To keep you beside me . 
Prayers for my Granny please ... she's not doing very well today . 
Sometimes I wish that it would rain here\ 
And wash away the west coast dreaming from my eyes\ 
I've been wanting to watch scream for a while now ... why does it have to be on at 2am and going till 4am ? Such a tease to my tired eyes : C 
I'm going to be pretty unreachable from Wednesday till Sunday . Going to be up in N.Y. Wednesday through Saturday afternoon and then working 4-930 Saturday evening . \ 
I'm going to need a miracle to get me through the next few days :/ 
\Tears of yesterday don't mean a thing . There is happiness out there for everyone who dares to dream\ " . Best words I've ever read written by my Granny . " 
Made it to charlotte , north < PROPFEMALE > :-) now just comes the hour long wait for the plane tampa 
Heading home from tampa ... to work later . Ugh . Ers is the last place I want to be after all this . I need a minute to myself . 
\Tears of yesterday don't mean a thing . There is happiness out there for everyone who dares to dream \"." 
To my relatives : If you have any pictures of Granny please send them to me . I don't want to leave the things from her service just sitting around my room so I decided to make a big scrapbook for her . 
And I'm sure the view from heaven\ 
Beats the hell out of mine here\ 
And if we all believe in heaven , \ 
Maybe we'll make it through one more year down here . 
Can't wait for the elections to be done and over with tomorrow . No more political commercials . No more political surveys at work . No more calls from political candidates . Sounds like a reason to party to me . lol . 
Individuals constitute the society , and , unless people change within , there can be no lasting change in the world . 
How I love the daily show & the colbert report :-) they always make me smile 
Oh how I wish I didn't have to work today -_- spend all day with < PROPFIRST > ? Spend 5 hours on a 20 minute long survey ? Which would I ratherrrrr doooo -_- 
Misses New York ... but I guess like a majority of things in my life there's really nothing I can do about it :/ 
So leave me , you're free\ 
It's three flights down to happiness\ 
Make sure you close the door\ 
And I'm onto you\ 
Nothing ever works out like it should 
5 hours with headphones on in front of a computer ... and what am I doing now ? Close to the same damn thing without being paid . lol . \ 
Btw , to < PROPMALE > & Elias ... thank you for the laughs tonight . It's always nice to have good company at ERS :) 
Biggest . headache . ever . and its only on the left side of my head . feels like I'm being continuously hit in the head with a baseball bat -_- 
My music just doesn't seem to go loud enough these days V_V 
What ? Work 4- 9:30 ? No . You cant make me * pouts * But those lovely pieces of green paper called money can : C 
Looking into colleges more ... thankkkk goodnesss . My summer vacation has been longgg enoughhhh . lol . 
Oh Eastern Research .... must I sit in your chairs again today ? 
A friend from work insisted on me borrowing a movie called \Waking Life\ " .... I really hope it doesn't suckkkkkkk <_<" 
Oh god .... 66 degrees ? Ehhh .. do I have to leave the house ? Lol . 
66 degrees my ass . Its hot out : c 
Dear computer ... I would love to know why you find it necessary to glitch while I'm playing Tetris online . Oh computer , you're making me lose . That doesn't make me smile . 
Finger tips wake up ... you're not allowed to sleep while the rest of my body is awake . lol . 
Life gets confusing when you lose track of what you really want . \ 
But as they say .. life is a terrible thing to sleep through . 
I'm staying awake to finish a Kid Cudi album ...... <_< I need to adjust my priorities . lol . \ 
Note to self : Sleep & Food should be a priority over listening to music . 
I'm going to hate myself later on for being awake right now . lol . \ 
Planned on waking up at 8am ... I laugh at that plan now :) 
When you hold one chance , \ 
And you break your hands . \ 
When the secret's safe , \ 
And you call my name . \ 
When the hurt gets real , \ 
And you still can't feel . \ 
When you can't escape , \ 
And you cannot stay\ 
Then I am gone . 
Can't believe I snapped a guitar string . Again . : C I hate replacing guitar strings almost as much as I hate tuning guitars . lol . Someone should make a guitar that you never have to tune and I would love them forever . Love playing .. hate tuning . 
Really hoping to finish reading Misery tonight <_< Only about 100 more pages to go . 
I need to get out of this town . Feels like there's nothing here for me anymore ... just a pair of headphones in an empty house . 
Am I off work yet ? : c 
Just finished reading Misery . Thank you < PROPFIRST > King .. I can see this book giving me nightmares for the next couple nights . 
It is way too warm for it to be nearing the end of november -_- 
< PROPFEMALE > of the Dead is on MTV ... my faith has been restored ever so slightly in that awful channel . lol . :) 
I love making an effort and getting nothing out of it except an increase in my own irritation . It's my favorite thing to do :P :) 
\To know and yet think we do not know is the highest attainment ; not to know and yet think we do know is a disease . \ 
I love having nightmares & depressing dreams all night long -.- 
Yellowcard , Sprite & Twix = An extremely happy < PROPFEMALE > :) 
Get to finally watch My Bloody < PROPFIRST > . Been wanting to see it since it first came out . Hopefully it doesnt suck :P Though I'm kinda expecting it to be bad since good horror films don't exist . lol :) 
My computer can barely play FEAR 2 ? You've gotta be kidding me * SIGH*\ 
So much for FEAR 3 and Homefront in March D: 
Korea on the brink of war ...? Hm .. Wonder if we'll stick our nose in that again . 
Do you care if I \ 
don't know what to say ? \ 
Will you sleep tonight\ 
or will you think of me ? \ 
Will I shake this off\ 
pretend it's all okay ? \ 
That there's someone out there\ 
who feels just like me ? \ 
There is . 
Just saw a shooting < PROPFEMALE > :) 
Dear Migrane : You're not welcome here . Please get the hell out of my brain . 
Ugh . Need to find a way music downloading program to update my ipod . 400 plus songs on my youtube playlists that aren't on my Ipod that neeedd to beeee lol :P 
Vampires Suck = extremely painful to watch . =.= 
Looking at old videos of me in my Sophomore year = A bad idea . Why didn't someone smack me for being such a nerd ?! lol 
33 degrees ... and I have to take out the dog ? Need to teach her how to use the toilet for nights like these . lol . :P 
Tonight at work suprisingly didn't suck . Yay for the good company that Eastern Research provides :) . 
Dear Brain : Don't you think that you give me enough headaches ? Can you tone it down to just one a week ? Instead of fricken everyyyy singleeee day . 
Sick of watching life pass me by . It's time to start going after what I really want instead of settling . 
I'm starting to think < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ends some of his books the way he does just to piss his readers off . * Sigh * 
Just saw a picture of Yellowcard's new cd .... \ 
0.0 \ 
I don't know how I'm going to wait till March !! 
Just found an old copy of < PROPFEMALE > Q . Please tell me I'm not the only one who remembers that movie . lol . 
Yellowcard is going on tour in the U.S. in Spring :D :D :D .. Reallyyy hoping they'll come to Tampa ... Looks like I better start trying to convince < PROPFIRST > to go with me <_< That'll be a task . lol . 
If people can < PROPFEMALE > McDonalds for \making\ " them fat ... can I < PROPFEMALE > Capital One for putting me in debt ? Same Difference isn't it ? ;) " 
Why is it when I'm up all night no one calls or texts me ... but if I go to bed early the whole world feels the need to hold a conversation with me . -.- 
Can I get a job just listening to music all day ? That would make me a happy lady . :) 
< PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > with < PROPFIRST > DiCaprio is on tv :-) haven't seen this movie in a couple years :-) 
Dad- \Allison 
Dear mr moon : I was told to come see u at 130 ... I look up & u still look the same . Do something already ! I'm not gonna stay up all night waiting for you to hide 
Ahhh ! I could get fear 1 and 2 and all the expansion packs for like .... $10.00 ... but guess whose computer can't run fear 2 . Its a sad sad day in < PROPFEMALE > land . lol 
Yellowcard ... you make working to fix my grandfather of a desktop a tolerable experience . lol . 
Debating on putting money towards a gaming computer <_< :) :) \ 
Alienware maybe ? Yeah ... maybe in my dreams . lol . 
Why does this cut on my heel burn like fire ? : C : C Kinda killinggg meee . 
< PROPFEMALE > christmas everyone :-) hope you're all having a nice day :-) 
To all my friends and relatives up north ... stay safe and warm in that snow storm :-) 
After some research I'm gonna TRY to setup Condemned on my pc again ... <_< \ 
Shoulda listened to < PROPFIRST > months ago when he was trying to pursuade my to build a computer or get an xbox . lol . 
Got Condemned to work . Cause I'm a beast at computers :) 
Finding The Short-Timers should not be this difficult of a book to find . I've only found maybe 5 copies online and they're all like 45-100 dollars V_V . \ 
You'd think it'd be easier to find considering Full Metal Jacket is based off it . 
Looking at pictures of Arizona and trying to figure out why we ever left ... lol . 
It's all success if it's what you need . Do what you like and do it honestly . 
My getting an Amazon account was a bad idea .. lol . I'm rediscovering all these old movies and books I used to LOVEEEE when I was smaller . :) \ 
Bunnicula and The Indian in the Cupboard anyone ? lol 
Why do dogs have to sniff every square inch of lawn before going to the bathroom ? Can't my doggy see me shiver in the cold ? lol 
F.E.A.R. 3 , Red Faction : Armageddon , Homefront , Duke Nukem Forever , Deus Ex 3 , Castlevania : Lords of Shadow , Diablo 3 and Mass Effect 3 ..... <_< .. All coming out this year ... I think I'll cry if I have to watch all these games hit the the store without being able to play any of them . 
Just beat Red Faction 2 in maybe about 10 hours of game play . Gaming skills have been retained :D 
I'm loving the beautiful weather outside :) Walked the doggy 3 times already today :) 
I need to get back on an Air Force base soon ... I miss the sound of those planes flying overhead every day :) 
In a < PROPMALE > & < PROPMALE > movie watching kinda mood :) 
I find a Keanu Reeves movie on tv ... and catch it during the last 5 minutes . \ 
My heart is breaking . lol . 
\If you bring forth what is within you 
I love thunderstorms :) 
Better start setting aside money for all the new cds coming out this year :D \ 
Blink 182 , Yellowcard , Sum41 and Simple Plan ... all my top favorite bands coming out with an album within the next few months :D :D :D 
Fellow employees : do any of you know why they're having us all come in at 6 ? 
\Dreams give us a door to open to our inner world ; they show the intricate workings of ourselves in ways that we cannot avoid or hide . \"" 
I wonder if I'll be able to convince < PROPFIRST > to come see Scream 4 with me in April . lol . :P \ 
Maybe I'll pull the \but its near my birthday * POUTS *\" card . " 
Considering Marchman for higher education = One of my worst ideas in Highschool . \ 
Now it's time to make up for all my indecision and time lost :P 
It's starting to seem like common sense isn't so common anymore -.- 
< PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE > on comedy central :-) 18 years of watching this movie and it still hasn't gotten old for me :-) 
If I don't get back in school soon I'm going to go crazyyyyy . \ 
1 year off of school is more than I wanted . 
My < PROPMALE > shepherd looks like how I feel . Dead tired . lol . She's still half asleep even though I have my music turned up . :P 
3,846 paint colors on Lowe's website <_< .... I feel like I've been clicking through the same dull shades of pinks , purples and blues for hourssssss . lol . 
Oh History Channel . I love how every week I watch you you show me atleast 8 different ways I could die . Thank you for the positivity . lol . 
Can I have my new Yellowcard cd now ? Please ? lol . \ 
It doesn't get released till the end of March but I already preordered it . Do want nowwwww :P 
I thought it might be a nice idea to send a letter to a soldier overseas to say thanks for their service . Who knew it'd be such a pain in the butt to find out how to send the letters over to em . lol . 
Don't wanna go to work . Can't I just stay home and watch SCREAM for the 50th time ? :) 
I hate the fact that I can't let go of the past :/\ 
Still stuck with a book that's missing pages . 
Note to self : Sum41s new album out on March 29 and Yellowcard releases their album on March 22 :) . 2 hopefully good albums coming out within a week of each other :) 
A little < PROPFEMALE > but overall a beautiful day outside :) 
To preorder Sum41's new album or attempt to find it in Best Buy or Hot Topic the day it comes out ... that is the question :P 
Yahoooooo !!!! Simple Plan's new album releases on June 21st :D :D :D :D \ 
Night has been made * Bounces off the walls * 
My prayers are with the people of Japan .... wish there was more I could do for them besides pray . :/ 
Xm radio makes me laugh :-) sir mixalot and faith no more played back to back . Nope . Don't miss 80s and 90s music . 
I've fallen in love with Yellowcards latest album . Hello replay button . It's good to be friends again :) 
I seem to be tanning realllyyy easily this year :P Only went outside for an hour and already have a tan line :) 
Ren fest then work 4-930 :-) 
Ya know you're reading a bad book when you start reading it thinking you'd never finished it . Then 5 pages in you realize you HAD finished it years ago and hated every sentence :P 
I need a new book to read : C The Legend of Sleepy Hollow makes me sleeeppyyy . lol .
