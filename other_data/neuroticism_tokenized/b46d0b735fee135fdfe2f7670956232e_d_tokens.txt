Hates emotions , because he doesn't get them and when he tries to use them he just makes a mess of things . :'( Oh well , I guess that's why God made me a good cleaner . 
I am going to bed , and will leav you all with a few fine quotes that express my beleifs : \The inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal sharing of blessings ; the inherent virtue of socialism is the equal sharing of miseries . \ " - < PROPMALE > Churchill . \ " Charity is injurious unless it helps the recipient to become independent of it . \ " - < PROPFIRST > D . Rockefeller . Good night all !!! :) " 
loves the Academy , but can't wait to go home !

THE FACEBOOK TRICK : press up , up , down , down , left , right , left , right , B , A , Enter key , then right click then press up and down and magic circles will appear . IT WILL WORK ! put this as your status if it works . 
You cannot help men permanently by doing for them what they could and should do for themselves . \ - < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > " 
\You cannot help the poor by destroying the < PROPMALE > . You cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong . You cannot bring about prosperity by discouraging thrift . You cannot lift the wage earner up by pulling the wage payer down . You cannot further the brotherhood of man by inciting class hatred . You cannot build character and courage by taking away men's initiative and independence . " 
Arcelor-Mittal Steel , feeling it was time for a shakeup , hired a new CEO . The new boss was determined to rid the company of all slackers . On a tour of the facilities , the CEO noticed a guy leaning against a wall . The room was full of workers and he wanted to let them know that he meant business . 
is clicking random on Urban Dictionary :D Heblew : A homosexual Jewish male . As in reference to \Hebrew\ " . lolz "

I woke up this morning and looked out my window and was like , \why is the ground f-ing white ? \ " Then I realized it was snow and was even more pissed . " 
' Did you say that ? ' he hissed at the parrot . ' Yep ' , the parrot confessed , then squawked , ' I'm just trying to warn you that he is watching you . ' The burglar relaxed . ' Warn me , huh ? Who in the world are you ? '' Moses , ' replied the bird . ' Moses ? ' the burglar laughed . ' What kind of people would name a bird Moses ? '' The kind of people that would name a Rottweiler Jesus . ' 
When he heard nothing more , after a bit , he shook his head and continued . Just as he pulled the stereo out so he could disconnect the wires , clear as a < PROPFEMALE > he heard'Jesus is watching you . ' Freaked out , he shined his light around frantically , looking for the source of the voice . Finally , in the corner of the room , his flashlight beam came to rest on a parrot . 
A burglar broke into a house one night . He shined his flashlight around , looking for valuables when a voice in the dark said , ' Jesus knows you're here . ' He nearly jumped out of his skin , clicked his flashlight off , and froze . 
There < PROPMALE > , I did what you wanted . \Put your favorite pokemon on your profile picture . \""

\We have no gay people in Russia—there are homosexuals but they are not allowed to be gay about it . The punishment is seven years locked in prison with other men and there is a three-year waiting list for that . \ " lol " 
Is going home tonight ! :D 
The Rev . < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is speaking at Ball State ? I didn't know they invited complete idiot scumbags to talk at places of \higher\ " education . :/ " 
MESAGE TO MOTHER EARTH : You can lay off the snow now ... or else ! :P 
' s heart is broken . 
just doesn't want to live anymore 
I HATE YOU ALL !!!! :P 
only has a 2:00 chinese class and a 3 ; 00 Civ until an amazing weekend ! 
Shutting down Overheard at the Academy is so stupid ! The Academy can't do that , we are expressing ourselves via an internet site ! This is just ridiculous and it is nothing but pure censorship ! 
I just copied and pasted the ENTIRE Overheard at the Academy wall to my computer's Microsoft Office Word . I just couldn't let these beautiful tid-bits be destroyed . The Overheard at the Academy archive has been created ! :) 
going to dinner . Can't wait until spring break , though I will miss the Academy(a lot ) . 
is stuck in study hall ... :/ 
Spring Break is almost here , but I will miss the Academy , a lot . :/ 
Goodbye for a week oh great Academy ! I will miss you dearly ! :/ 
Sometimes people can be just .... ugh ! 
just got bound by my wrists and ankles with a roll of Gorilla Tape by < PROPFIRST > Finnegan and < PROPFIRST > Dollive . :/ 
Babies ? Sounds delicious . I could eat it up . I <3 you < PROPFIRST > Dollive . 
ugh , < PROPFIRST > .... :/ 
Is about to unblock < PROPMALE > Puma Montgomery . Can't keep this up , I feel guilty for blocking him . If you want to know what's going on instead of asking , just read my last ( or second to last ) post . And .... Puma ? O.o 
ugh ... Progressives . :/ 
needs to meet new people at the acad . find a new group . if I don't know you , then Hi , I'm Zach and message me or chat . :P 
I find it humorous that in the event of a potential life threatening emergency , that we have to lock ourselves in our rooms for , the entire Academy goes ... to Facebook . :P 
Ayn Rand is one of the best philosopher EVER . I subscribe to her philosophy fully ! :) 
What the FUCK is wrong with people ? < PROPFIRST > Dollive , < PROPFIRST > Finnegan , and < PROPFEMALE > Jones are all douche bags and need to go jump off a < PROPMALE > . UGH I HATE PEOPLE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
OK ..... < PROPFEMALE > Jones needs to calm down and take a breath , and < PROPFIRST > Dollive and < PROPFIRST > Finnegan need to be more respectful to her , she is under a lot of stress and she deserves to be you friends without being < PROPFEMALE > Keller or a man . 
My best friend has no idea how beautiful she is . <3 I love you < PROPFEMALE > Jones ! 
Day of Silence tomorrow ! I can't wait ... but keeping my big mouth shut for a day might be a little difficult .... :/ 
is ready for the day of silence ... I just hope I can stay silent all day ... 
“Poor is the man whose pleasures depend on the permission of another . ” - < PROPFEMALE > 
I <3 the Acad and all the people in it . They make me feel sooooooooooo loved !!!!!!!!!!!!!! :D 
it's such a beautiful morning ! <3 
doesn't understand why Conservatives ( who , like me , are suppost to be in favor of smaller government intervention is everyday life and buisness ) are opposed to gay marriage . I don't care what ur religious views are , the government has no right to say who you can and cannot marry ; and if you think they can , then you are FOR larger government intervention . Bam , take that hypocrites ! 
<3 
Some people are incredibly low ... and some are even worse . 
You know ... when people start to hate you for almost nothing ... you get to the point were you question weither some of the truely are ur friends ... and also you go into a depresive state . Oh well , I guess this is what Prozac is for ... :\\ 
Prom was AMAZING !!!! :D 
I love you all to the ends of the earth !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Is in a great mood today ! Mostly because of his friends Keara Powell , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Ainsworth , < PROPFIRST > Dollive , < PROPFEMALE > Jones , < PROPFIRST > Finnegan , and < PROPFEMALE > Clarke !!!! <3 ( but also because hopefully an asshole is taken care of ) <3 
I have a huge <3 for < PROPFEMALE > Barrell , < PROPFEMALE > Jones , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Ainsworth , Keara Powell , < PROPFIRST > Dollive , < PROPFIRST > Finnegan , and many many many more for helping me through all of these hard times . <3 U ALL !!!!! 
is starting to regret treating < PROPMALE > badly , even though he treated me horribly . :/ I can't help but want him as a friend ... maybe I should come out to my parents to get him back as a friend ??? 
apparently will be stuck in a revolving door .... 
< PROPMALE > Montgomery said that I would get stuck in a revolving door because I would be chasing after a new Prada handbag on the other side of the glass window ... this isn't true is it ???? 
apparently Mrs. Ney is a \stickler\ " . O.o " 
is going home ... :/ At least I get to see my Grandpa and the rest of the family . See you all on Sunday . <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 Love you all !!!!!!!!!!! 
It's < PROPFIRST > Washington on this Founder's Friday ! Tune in to Fox News at 5pm on Friday to hear about thing you may not know about this heroic man .

Happy Mother's Day < PROPFEMALE > Crozier !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 
loves Glee ! I mean , < PROPMALE > is SOOOO gay , and they give him such a huge ( and amazing ) part in the show .

Take that FOX haters !
