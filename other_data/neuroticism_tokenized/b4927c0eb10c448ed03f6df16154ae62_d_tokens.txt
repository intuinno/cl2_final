( FW :) Thursday rocked ! Great note to end 2010 on . But I need this fresh start . Happy freaking New Year's , dudes and dudettes }: ) 

Five teenage boys have committed suicide in 3 weeks due to being bullied\ 
because of their sexuality . Re-post this if you're more concerned about\ 
this than < PROPFIRST > Lohan going to rehab . 
After noticing we have whipped cream , chocolate frosting , and < PROPFEMALE > syrup , but nothing to use these things with ( such as ice cream , cupcakes , or pancakes ) , I decided to try them all on a cheesy nachos dipped in salsa . This resulted in flailing around my kitchen like a Tyrannosaurus-Rex , screeching like an angry cat , then gagging & cringing . To this moment I cannot figure out what possessed me to try something so foul 
MY INTERNET ISN'T WORKING GAH * PISSED * FFFFFFFFFF . I AM LION-O HEAR ME ROAR . 
The worst , the best , and everything in between . My life is slowly unraveling and coming together all at once . It's terrible . Bittersweet and terrible . And yet the journey has only just begun . I wish it could be any other way . 
I need how many fillings ...? Thirteen ? More awesome news this month .

Just love it when everything that can go wrong does go wrong . 
Tomorrow is < PROPFEMALE>'s sweet sixteen 8D Can't wait for you me and JT to < PROPFEMALE > ; hopefully Darian can join us . Happy birthday < PROPFEMALE > ! 
STUFF IS HAPPENING . 
Quotes time ! 
* as < PROPMALE > plays a video game ; two characters are parachuting together * Lucius : Who are you driving ? 
Katie : AH ! I can put stuff in my butt ! HA * referring to a back pocket on her coat * 
Me : I can't read a black circle sideways ! 
Kurt : WE'RE HIS FANGIRLS . 
JT : If I wasn't wearing this hotdog , my nipples would be hard as diamonds right now . 
Kurt : What if they were flying , and Appa just farted , like PPBBBLLLTTT ? * giggles * That'd be gross . Heh heh . Magical creature monster farts . 
Katie : Yeah . I don't even know where to find strippers , and crack , or whatever . 
Darian : Angry gorilla tits !! 
I've had pneumonia all this time . No wonder I wasn't getting any better . Unfortunately , my mother & < PROPMALE > caught it too . 
My last status never went through . Freaking facebook mobile . 
Oh wow . Lucius : I can't help it , I have a bad rememory . Josh : Rememory ? Lucius : ... I meant remembery . 
ÜMe : Then find a way to entertain yourself for 2 minutes . Kurt : * starts dancing * I like potatoes , I like potatoes ... Oh yeah I love tatoes , tatoes tatoes 
Ütatoes ... ( And this was a 2 minute dance . ) 
In Rock Band 2 , my new band of one is named The Galactic Stripper Squad . I would've thrown something about robots in there if it fit in the title . 
Insult to injury . Seems to be my life's theme . 
It's all good , yo . See , I know . There's some things you gotta understand about Toad . 
When the side-effects are worse than the initial problem , I'm screwed . Getting sick of this pattern . 
Aang : No , Fire Lord Ozai . YOU'RE not wearing pants . Ozai : NO ! My < PROPMALE > parts are showing !! 
3 weeks sick , 1 week recovery , and now I got to bounce back from doing nothing for a month . Can't wait till I get my energy back . 
BAGEL EGG BOLOGNA CREAM CHEESE , YAY . SNOW , NOT YAY . 
Nobody's around to bully me ... The house is quiet ... I got the XBox all to myself ... This is a very rare , wonderful moment to be fucking cherished !! 
Hahaha , well that was the best 3 minutes of my week . I will reminisce about it for days . 
'' And I wish that everyone would go and shut their mouth / I'm not strong enough to deal with it . '' 
Let it snow my ass , somebody make it stop ! This bites !! 
Slice apple . Chill . Heat peanut butter . Add brown sugar ; blend well . Dip . Like freakin candied apples . I love finding tricks to make eatin right less of a bitch 
I guess I scare people . I'm sorry I tried being friends . 
I just got treated like dirt by a couple of rude receptionsits for absolutely no reason , then I read a bunch of random junk from wackos on facebook that made me grin . Thank you , random silly Billys , for cheering me up . 
Just when I start to think it's bad , it gets worse . 
Everyone needs to fuck off RIGHT NOW before I explode ! I don't want to hear anymore ! 
I am screwed . 
I might not be online when it's time to switch pictures for Avatar Month thing , so I'm preparing early . Hurr : B 
My aunts+mother left for my grandma's w/o me . Dad's gettin drunk on Christmas . I haven't had a real meal in weeks & I haven't eaten in 2 days . < PROPFEMALE > Christmas ! 
Fuck me . 
I apologize for the negativity . Happy holidays , guys . 
I'm looking forward to a new year . 
I should come with a warning label ; \Does not play well with others . \"" 
I stayed up all night playing GTA : TLAD for the 1st time , only to wish I'd slept . I got wasted so many times that I Iost more $ than I made . 
I HAVE NO PHONE . THEREFORE I HAVE NO MOBILE INTERNET . THEREFORE I HAVE NO FACEBOOK . SEE YOU NEXT YEAR . 
It's a sad state of affairs when I , of all people , am the most mature adult in the group . ... Extremely sad . 
xD This comedian interviewing someone from Glee just called the Glee fans \so hot . \ " I must agree . " 
$20 phones are only twenty dollars for a reason ]': 
I'm having a love affair on my favorite flavored mayo with curry sauce . OH THE SCANDAL ~ ! 
I'm getting pretty sick of migraines D < 
I have experienced many strange things . But I was very surprised today when a traffic light growled at me . 
I am never having children . 
What color flag would a matador wave at a ' red bull ? ' 
I am really , really sick . 
Didn't wanna drama-up facebook since I didnt know what was goin on , but my mother was missing . She's home now , & safe . I'm pretty damned ecstatic today <3 
I cannot believe < PROPMALE > is upset w/ us kids , & mom+dad , because my folks have the audacity to feed us . How dare we .__. ; 
I loves me some Goldfish ; even if it's creepy when your food grins at you . 
It'r colder than a bitch out there 8O 
It's going to be a long time before I'm okay again . 
< PROPMALE>'s attempting to mimic Kitara's water bending moves ; w/ sound effects too . Thought you'd like to know . 
GIGANTIC BOX OF GOLDFISH !! 
For some reason my dumbass phone forbids mobile internet . No facebook til I go to the library :( 
I believe I missed something I wanted to attend online due to lack of internet a while back D8 > I have the worst freaking memory , I can't believe it took this long to realize it . 
< PROPFEMALE>'s puppy likes to eat everything ; including my pants and shoes . ... and toes . 
... and Monopoly pieces , and hands , and new coat , and even my sprite ... 
is having a really fucking hard time not being enaged at < PROPMALE > for a whole lot of things . 
I think it's this house that's depressing me most . I can't wait to have a place of my own . 
just got 4 very deep silver fillings ; & despite enough novacaine to imitate a stroke , it hurts pretty bad . I'm still bleeding . 
Doing laundry at freaking 3 AM is much better with cheesy bacon baked potatoes and sour cream . And facebook . 
New contest : name the sock monkey . Submit however many names you like . Unusual ones prefered . Ends 02/16/11 
Hallelujah , not everything is going wrong 
I can't stand mocking & lies . The things being said about me are sick . I thought I left all of this behind . A certain jackass needs to grow up . 
< PROPFEMALE > insists there's an asteroid due to destroy Earth in 25 years . Anyone got proof to prove true or otherwise ? 
< PROPMALE > just made up a rap about cereal , going 20 < PROPMALE > an hour , and facing off with pimps . 
Never thought I'd say this , but the pokemon in the 5th generation look so much cooler than the ones in the 4th . Going for black version ! 
... make it white . I got the legendary pokemon mixed up . 
Apparently my astrological sign changed from a ram to a fish . 
Do a little dance , make a little love . Get down tonite B-) 
I got a headache from loud music , sick from all the food & danced like a fool . Great night out :] 
General Tso's crispy chicken <3 What a weekend 
Is it wrong to fall in love with cookies ? Because that's a descent into madness I wouldn't mind . 
My sister's leaving 4 Jersey tomorrow . She took my charger & might leave w/ it . I wont have a cell 4 weeks ! 
NDFUGFBEIUPDBSAIDIF < PROPMALE > NEEDS TO CHANGE HIS FACE BOOK RIGHT THIS INSTANT . 
Facebook gives you the option to hide your sex but still uses masculine or feminine pronouns depending on what you use . So facebook can kiss my ass . I'm not real happy that I have to pick the wrong sex so it will get the pronouns right . This is awkward . 
When I'm not making dinner , I'm buying dinner . When I'm not buying dinner , I'm making dinner . Jeezum . 
< PROPMALE > discovered QWOP xD We're playing 
< PROPFIRST>'s Day is really just another excuse for me to have < PROPFEMALE > ... like I need one . Of course it's always better post V-Day when it goes on sale >> I don't need drama :D I have chocolate . 
This existential crisis crud is always far worse for me when I'm exhausted and alone . 
And I find it kind of funny , I find it kind of sad . The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had . I find it hard to tell you , I find it hard to take . When people run in circles it's a very very mad world . 
The 1 time Pittsfield < PROPFEMALE > is on World's Dumbest Criminals a rival dealer is pissing on cars @ the last dealership where we bought a car . 
Ancient cupcake & soda for breakfast @3PM . I'm a responsible adult . 
An outdoor lunch , some peace & solitude , and a blue sky . So far , a lovely day . 
Massive migraine today . 
Doesn't everyone keep their slim jims in the bathroom ? 
Up all night w/ abdominal pain again . Wont hear from me till Mon . I need a day 2 recover . 
xD My mom has a 2 week old carnation that went through the washer and dryer and somehow it looks like it was just cut . WTF ? Hanging out with my girl < PROPFEMALE > today <3 Going out for a bit to eat =) Busy week , but should be good 
I forgot about the sock monkey challenge ! ... Uh ... Judging will be held tomorrow . 
I just had a bad fight w/ my dad ; to make matters worse < PROPMALE > is pissed @ me for it . 
I really don't think it's too much to ask not to steal what little of value I own . 
I'm aware that they're girl's jeans , you may stop freaking out at me now . Although I'm flattered my style means so much to you :] It's nice to have fans . 
Serious question dudes . Does anyone know ( or know someone who knows ) if there's anybody who does gender-affirming treatment nearby ? I'm going to start taking testosterone but I don't have a car ; I'll be walking or taking the bus . Any and all information will be appreciated ! 
saw < PROPFIRST > Sweet live :] 
Such a lonely day , and it's mine . It's a day that I'm glad I survived . 
I'm getting sicker . Can't wait for this to pass >:[ 
Sketching , insomnia , Criminal Minds , & goldfish . It's a good night indeed . 
I'm not going to take it anymore . ... So do your worst . Scar tissue is thicker . 
Kaiba nun . 
Dear insomnia : we musn't keep meeting this way . I'm leaving you . 
It's cold today D: 
2 more job applications submitted . Crossing my fingers . 
And now's the time to panic . 
Guess who feels awesome today =] 
I must be dreaming <3 
Found a nice bruise from running into someone during lasertag xD I'm so hardcore 
Such a foggy , rainy , dreary day ... 
< PROPMALE > , if you're reading this , get the hell off my facebook . Log out or prepare to be destroyed . 
Today I'm going to take life by the throat and shake it like a rag doll . Those who dare oppose me beware . 
I won't be the last one in line . I've finally figured out what's mine . 
Dad better set up the scanner one me these days . I'm back , mofo . 
Going to go home and get some cleaning done :( Then hopefully get more work done in photoshop ! 
I'm finding schoolwork in which I refered to myself with they & their instead of she & her . Did my parents never ask themselves why ? 
I'm all < PROPMALE > up on music , & I always play to win . I ain't got no time for loving , cuz my time is all used up , just a sittin round creating all that groovy kind of stuff . Well I'm a man , yes I am , & I can't help but love you so . 
just ran into an old friend :] Things keep getting better . 
I didn't see my lifelong friend < PROPFEMALE > for ages . Then , by < PROPMALE > , I got to < PROPFEMALE > out with her today !! How kickass is that ? ... Very . Very kickass . 
I may not be where I want to be in life right now , but damn it I'm finally on the right tracks . 
Somebody has four new bandannas . < PROPFEMALE > time at 3:45 !! Gotta love that girl :D 
I'm < PROPMALE > . At everything . Ever . What the hell have I been doing with my time for so long without drawing and writing ?? 
I have three wives and one husband for the next week . 
Once my dad gets home I'm walking to Hold the Anchovies . If anyone's in the area you should hit me up and make some plans .

Where We Met-\ 
Would I hug you ? \

Have I ever had feelings for you ? \ 
Would I marry you on FB ? \ 
Do I need you in my life ? \ 
What are we ? \ 
Do I like your profile picture ? \ 
Truth is : 
The sun is up . The sky is blue . It's beautiful . And so are you ! Dear < PROPFEMALE > - won't you come out to play ? 
I can't change my profile picture since I can't find my adapter for my mini SD card :( On the bright side , I did find a bunch of really old photos I never got to upload . Eh . 
Don't you know that you are a shooting < PROPFEMALE > ? And all the world will love you just as long , as long as you are 
It's snowing . Awe HELL no ! 
I tend to ruin everything . 
I'm not going to be apologetic and self-pitying anymore . It needs to stop . And I'm not going to be a doormat either . Next time somebody says something , I'll tell them to suck it . I am not a loser . I will not be treated like one . 
Estimated death toll in Japan is likely over 10,000 . I can't even fathom the grief and disaster . 
>> I deleted my status : Today I kicked asthma's ass and finally started running :] 
I'm not okay . I'll be back when I am . 
I'm still not alright but I know things will get better eventually . Off to Live Out Loud . 
Hello again . 
I MISSED THE DANCE AND I'M PISSED . LIKE YOU HAVE NO IDEA . I NEEDED A NIGHT OUT AND I BLEW IT . 
Insomnia gives me no choice but to stay up all night sketching . 
Unexpected hangout time with my girl < PROPFEMALE > :D it's been a good night 
Some people think I'm crazy , but try to understand . I get satisfaction out of everything I can . 
It's a broke day , but everything is OK . I'm up all night , but everything is alright . It's a rough week , and I don't get enough sleep . It's a long year pretending I belong here . 
Thank you , Miss < PROPFIRST > Holiday <3 
Thanks for all the birthday wishes everyone ! <3 I'm feeling the love :] 
My older brother has passed away . 
We buried my brother < PROPMALE > today . Now < PROPMALE > and Jerod are gone . I'm just thankful I have the rest of my family and friends . We'll get through this together . It's the only way . 
I had an awesome time with my sister yesterday , then today I got to < PROPFEMALE > out with < PROPFEMALE > AND < PROPFEMALE > . I get by with a little help from my friends <3 
One . Moment . At a time . 
I love being left out . 
Last night my nephew wrote a remix called Black & Purple about a black and purple bicycle xD It was pretty great :] 
2011 has been hell thus far . It's just GOTTA get better from here on out . Can't wait to escape for a few hours . 
Today my father taught me how to tie a tie . 
Tonight just keeps getting weirder by the minute . 
If my body was on fire , ooh you'd watch me burn down in flames . You said you loved me , you're a liar ' cuz you never , ever , ever did , baby . But darling I'd still catch a grenade for ya . 
I have some catching up to do with my challenges . :-\\ Must get back to that . 
I'm not a toy to be played with . I'm a human being with a human heart . I can only take so much . 
Sorry guys . Ran out of minutes on my cell . Hit me up on facebook anytime , and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can . 
I shall reiterate . Guys , I have no minutes on my phone . Ergo , I cannot answer my twenty new text messages . If you really need me just get at me on facebook ! 
My room is ( basically ) clean !! No hazmat suits necessary . I can't be certain nothing's living in there but this is the best it's looked since I moved in :] 
is playing Pokémon Yellow .
