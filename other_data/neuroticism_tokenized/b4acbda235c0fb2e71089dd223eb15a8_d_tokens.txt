all hopes of being productive in 2-d design went out the window today when my professor said she was going to have conferences in the hallway . . . . :D 
wishes that she lived in a simpler society , where having the best things or fancy dinners or the newest clothes didn't matter . . . a place where the little things were still appreciated : reading a book , playing a game , sitting under the stars , talking until midnight . . . is that really so horrible to want those things ? 
kinda wants to play monopoly . . . . any takers ? :D 
has decided she wants a full keyboard with a pedal and touch-sensitive keys for christmas . that's not too expensive , is it ? :/ 
doesn't really have homework to work on . . . GOOD LORD , what do I do with my time !? I can't even remember ! :) 
sent her phone through the washer AND dryer . . . and it still functions !!!!!! YES ! i just can't see the screen anymore . . . good thing all the important people are on speed dial .

\More people are accepting the view that wedding bells aren't needed to have a family . Four in ten say marriage is becoming obsolete . \ " ~ Yahoo News . This makes me sad :( "

Trace Richolson is too tall . < PROPFEMALE > Daane , I think it is time we sit on his head . And force some growth-stunting hormones down his throat .

wait . . . im going home tomorrow ? no , that can't be . . . the semester JUST started . i swear it did . 
packing = hard . if i was smart i would pack less clothes . . . but i'm not smart . and hey , two suitcases for a month isn't THAT bad , is it ? XP 
went through allllll kinds of trouble to get snazzy earmuffs and hobo-gloves so i didn't freeze in chicago . i left one of the gloves in < PROPFEMALE>'s car , and it was too warm for the earmuffs :( . poo . < PROPFEMALE > i took silly pictures with them on the bus ride ! :D

what do you do on a day when everyone is off being busy and you have nothing to do ? Paint , of course ! 
everyone tells me I am a good person . . . that I am worth their time . Why does everyone believe that but me ?

Unstoppable = very good . I think I'm surprised . . . while the previews looked good , I had some speculation about watching a train movie . I am rather glad it exceeded my expectations . 
safari is stupid . quitting unexpectedly over and over is NOT appreciated . :/

This is < PROPFEMALE > taking over Tierney's computadora . Muahahaha ! \

in the mood to watch a sappy love story . . . sadly , one cannot watch those alone ; that is no fun at all . Maybe I'll watch a Disney movie instead . 
leaves friday . and probably isn't going to see much of her friends this week . . . sad . 
The guy who did the AMAZING disney songs on the piano has officially stolen my heart . . . or maybe just his magic piano-playing hands have . Either way , I am in awe . Trace Richolson look what you have done to me . 
I'm up ! It is 6:50 in the morning , and I am awake . . . too bad it's only to go < PROPFEMALE > out . I wonder if I'll ever do anything productive . XD
