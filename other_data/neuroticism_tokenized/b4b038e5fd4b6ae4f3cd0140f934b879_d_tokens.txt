i just fell in dog poop ! 

R.I.P. < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > 
fuckin hoola-hoop girl 
fucken BORED 
I smoke a fat pound of grass \ 
and fall on my ass faster than the fat bitch who sat down too fast . \ 
C'mere slut , I don't give a fuck God sent me to piss the world off . \ 
My English teacher wanted to have sex in < PROPMALE > high , \ 
The only problem was my English teacher was a guy . \ 
I smacked him in the face with an eraser , chased him with a stapler , \ 
stapled his nuts to a stack of papers . \ 
Walked in the strip club , had my jacket zipped up . \ 
Flashed the bartender , then stuck my < PROPMALE > in the tip cup . \ 
Extraterrestrial , killin pedestrians . \ 
Raping lesbians while they screaming :\ 
LETS JUST BE FRIENDS !! \ 
Am I comin ' or goin ? \ 
I can barely decide . \ 
I ain't had a woman in years , \ 
my palms are too hairy to hide ! 
Straight from the hip , cut to the chase . \ 
I'll tell a mo'fuckin slut to her face . \ 
Play no games , say no names\ 
I'm a different man , kiss my ass . \ 
Kiss my lips , bitch why ask ? \ 
Kiss my < PROPMALE > , hit my cash . \ 
I'd rather have you whip my ass . \ 
Don't put out ? I'll put you out . \ 
Won't get out ? I'll push you out . \ 
Puss blew out , poppin ' shit . \ 
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out . \ 
Am I too nice ? Buy you ice\ 
Bitch if you died , wouldn't buy you life . 
who the fuck farted on my pillow ? 
Come gather ' round people\ 
Wherever you roam\ 
And admit that the waters\ 
Around you have grown\ 
And accept it that soon\ 
You'll be drenched to the bone . \ 
If your time to you\ 
Is worth savin'\ 
Then you better start swimmin'\ 
Or you'll sink like a stone\ 
For the times they are a changin ' . 
All I know is pain\ 
All I feel is rain\ 
How can I maintain\ 
with that shit on my brain ? 
Finished with my woman ' cause she couldn't help me with my mind\ 
People think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time\ 
All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy\ 
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify\ 
Can you help me occupy my brain ? \ 
I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find\ 
I can't see the things that make true happiness , I must be blind\ 
Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry\ 
Happiness I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal\ 
And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state\ 
I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too late 
I never showed what was inside . \ 
You would have cursed and cried , \ 
If I ended myself by suicide . \ 
Forced myself to wear a smile , \ 
Spread jolly good joy for awhile . \ 
Then my body gave out\ 
And Death soon came . \ 
You think living is lame ? \ 
I'm spending an eternity in flame\ 
And I'm the only one to blame . \ 
Then the worst caught up with the bad , \ 
I lost two people I thought I'd always have . \ 
A drunk driver missed the brake and hit the gas , \ 
Now I'm kicking myself in the ass . \ 
I collapse and bury my head , \ 
As demons hiss \Your parents are dead ! \ " \ 
The hopeful side of me waits for your text . \ 
But the side of me that knows better , \ 
Is glad when no text comes . \ 
Then the side of me that never learns makes a move . 
All is well , \ 
But I still weep inside . \ 
Made a move\ 
and got DENIED !! \ 
LOL 
God < PROPMALE > me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change ;\ 
Courage to change the things I can ;\ 
And wisdom to know the difference . \ 
Living one day at a time ;\ 
Enjoying one moment at a time ;\ 
Accepting hardships as the pathway to peace ;\ 
Taking , as He did , this sinful world\ 
As it is , not as I would have it ;\ 
Trusting that He will make all things right\ 
If I surrender to His Will ;\ 
That I may be reasonably happy in this life\ 
and supremely happy with Him\ 
Forever in the next . \ 
Amen\ 
\ 
Good night , shitheads . 
yay insomnia 
I offered a helping hand , \ 
She gave me the cold shoulder . \ 
I gave her the tingle , \ 
She played me like Sorry . \ 
The world is in flame , \ 
She's still on my brain . \ 
I can't shake this off , \ 
She's here to stay . \ 
To suffer no more , \ 
I pray . 
I'm not playing your game it's no fun\ 
This is me throwing in my towel , hun . \ 
If you still don't get it try this one , \ 
Leave me alone , I'm done . 
Is that grape soda ? \ 
WTF yo 
Repetition , repetition , repe-TIT-ion 
Zero Motivation Today 
Yeah , just to be happy for once\ 
I sacrificed things that never should be . \ 
Thinking it’ll be worth it in the end\ 
But when it’s in sight the world does a 180 on me . \ 
Now I’m stuck in limbo between who I used to be\ 
And the mislead youth that you now see . \ 
Trying to stay sane and keep my head straight\ 
But my inner voice is telling me it's too late . \ 
No joy , no love , no hope\ 
I’m running uphill in this life long race\ 
Just to make it one behind last place . 
There musta been somethin in that tea cuz rofl 
What an odd co winky dink 
Wish in one hand and shit in the other . See which one fills up first . 
Fuck deviation . 
yay ambien 
Nice to meet you . Hi , my name is .... I FORGOT MY NAME !!!
