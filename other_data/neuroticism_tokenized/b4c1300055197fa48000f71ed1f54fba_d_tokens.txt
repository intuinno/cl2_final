Via < PROPFEMALE > Wheeler : In honor of MS awareness week , March 7th-13th , 2011 , I am asking if everyone could please put this as your status for one hour if you or someone you love has Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) . My prayer is that in 2011 a cure will be found . Will you post it ? Just for one hour ( or more if you wish ! ) . Do it in the memory and the honor of those fighting MS !
