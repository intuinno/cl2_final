As followers of Christ , we have more power than we realize . Don't think too much , or in other words , don't psyche yourself out with rules and requirements . Step into the situation because you have what it takes ; it will come to you when you need it . And remember ... the Holy Spirit is within you giving you what you need , when you need it . Doubt is simply a luxury we can't afford any more . 
WOMEN'S ASS SIZE STUDY ... There is a new study about women and how they feel about their asses ... the results were pretty interesting . 30% of women think their ass is too fat . 10% of women think their ass is too skinny . The remaining 60% say they don't care , they love him , he's a good man and they wouldn't trade him for the world ... I know you're laughing !! Feel free to repost this if you love your ass ! LOL 
God delights in us just as we are . You are pleasing to God already . Or to put it another way : God likes you . This may be hard to believe but it is true . You bring pleasure to God right now as you read this . \ 
So take it . Bask in it . Yes , right now , without lifting a finger , God is pleased with you . He made you for this . He made you and He delights in you . This is where we start . 
< PROPFIRST > Sheen 47 , is all over the news because he's a celebrity drug addict . While < PROPFIRST > Wilfahrt 31 , < PROPFIRST > Tabada 21 , < PROPMALE > Hizon 22 , Chauncy Mays 25 are all soldiers who gave their lives this week with no media mention . Honor THEM by re-posting this status ! 
..... off to work 
When an open mind wants to influence someone with what it believes , it does a lot of listening . It wants to get as much out on the table as possible . And then , instead of clearing it as the closed mind does , it finds what it can connect with on the table . It finds what's useful in moving someone on in the process of seeking truth . 
But the truth remains : no matter how bad someone else might seem to me , I am worse . \ 
And then I bring all this to the table and find out about God's mercy ...... 
So tired .... been out of bed for an hour and my eyes are still burnng , did not sleep well last night at all ! \ 
Oh well , back to work .... maybe I can slip out early today .....? ;)
