HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYBODY ! \\n- DRUGGY DRUMMER HAMSTER - 

Having trouble keeping my head on my shoulders . Duct tape doesn't help a bit either . 
But what do you say to taking chances , What do you say to jumping off the edge ? Never knowing if there's solid ground below Or hand to hold , or hell to pay , What do you say , What do you say ? 
Just got home from playing in my first soccer game as a goalkeeper . Made a few good stops and let a few go but it wasn't too bad . 
Just got home from Shutter Island . Everbody said it was stupid and confusing but i loved it because it was confusing . Ireally wish i had more time to < PROPFEMALE > out with my friends . I have too much to do . 
I hate right angles . I will forever hate right angles . 
Just finished another poem if you'd like to read . 
\Everything is fucking green ! \"" 
Look to the future but dont ever forget your past . Your past is , after all , the reason you are who you are today . 
I just realized that the front lawn of the school is way to green . 
I graduate , turn 18 , and have a new job all on the same day . Today will be either the best day of my life or the worst but i hope its the best . Thanks everybody . 
Graduate , turn 18 , and get your first job all on the same day ... im not sure ive had a more important day in my life . Thanks for everything guys . 
ATTENTION ! : I find four leaf clovers bring me bad luck ! I have about four or five right now . One is already promised to someone but if you would like one let me know and you can have it ! 
I wish i could sing like < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > . 
I love my friends . 
\Our lives improve only when we take chances and\ 
has not painted a < PROPFEMALE > but instead part of a beach scene and half an orchid . 
is finally getting a laptop . 
So the bookbag and all the software for the laptop arrived . The only thing missing is the laptop . 
I finally learned to stop looking at the bad things in life . Then they run and jump in front of me to remind me that they're there to stay ! :) Ain't life great ?! 
just learned how to play chasing cars :) 
Just gonna stand there And watch me burn But that's alright Because I like The way it hurts\ 
Just gonna stand there And hear me cry But that's alright Because I love The way you lie 
Why must everyone have a good friday the 13th except me ? 
Thank god for friends cause i have no idea where id be without them . 
I'm not afraid to take a stand\ 
Everybody come take my hand\ 
We'll walk this road together , through the storm\ 
Whatever weather , cold or warm\ 
Just lettin ' you know that , you're not alone\ 
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road 
FUCK . MY . LIFE . AND . THE . WORLD . 
Mind . officially . blown . away . 
Life sucks . Therefore I shall flip it a bird and continue my walk right through the middle of it while keeping a smile on my face just to piss it off . 
Life sucks even worse today . I have no energy to flip it a bird let alone smile . So today I'm just not going to react to anything it throws at me , even the bullshit , and hopefully that will piss it off as bad as what I did last time . 
I could really use a wish right now . 
What would you wish for if you had one < PROPMALE > ? 
I love < PROPFIRST > Sinatra :) 
I love madea :) 
playing poker with people that are just drunk as hell is sooooo much fun :) If only it were real money :/ 
1885 basebal cards to organize tonight :/ 
poker , < PROPMALE > , friends , and no common sense tomorrow . This is gonna be hilarious . 
great day ends in a migrane , heartburn , and misery . but eveytime i think about sliding down the hill on a piece of cardboard with a smiling cop passing by , it doesnt seem so bad . 
finally got the lesson in < PROPMALE > and the teacher let us go an hour early . now i get a 3 hour nap instead of 2 ! 
i dont want to do this anymore . 
F my life . 
apparently when i flipped life the bird and kept smiling it decided to come up behind me and trip me . It laughed when i fell on my face . 
loves bullshit . No ... I'm serious ! World please share all your bullshit with me ........ Oh ... you already have ! 
I decided to cook some eggs for dinner and i cracked one egg . normal . the next egg had 2 yolks . has anyone ever heard of this ? 
\In the midst of happiness I find a hole blacker than the devils soul . When I looked in I found a picture of you . You’re not who I thought you were . I miss who you used to be . Please come back . But Until then I will say goodbye . Because you have changed I cannot even tell who you are anymore . I hope the next time we meet we can be the friends we once were . \"- anonymous " 
\If I'm not back in five minutes ... wait longer\ " < PROPMALE > you are amazing :) " 
Got an A+ on a project , found out two stupid paper rough drafts are no due tomorrow , remembered two more things , today is officially amazing :) 
Its pretty bad when you dont want to talk to someone and you text them on accident . 
I know how im gonna do my self portrait !! I thought it would take me forever to think of i guess not . 
Im going to murder the fucking orthodontist !!! 
Dear < PROPMALE > County no matter how bad you make me feel , how many bad memories you hold , how sad you make me feel as I drive to your high school , I will always love and never forget you . No mater how many times I might say I want you to go to hell . 
May all graphite be thrown into the lake of fire . 
Im hoping ... more like praying that i pass this test tomorrow .
