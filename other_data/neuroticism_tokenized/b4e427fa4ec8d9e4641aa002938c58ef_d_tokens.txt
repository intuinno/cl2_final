Well ... went into work 3 hours early .. crap ! Went home now waiting till 1 to go back to work . Today is .. kind of crappy to say the least . 
\Christmas is a gift of love wrapped in human flesh and tied securely with the strong promises of God . \ 
I may have just yelled at our neighbors kids ... but after 20 minutes or so of two young girls screaming at each other .. I snapped ! Perhaps I will blame it on these darn pregnancy hormones .
