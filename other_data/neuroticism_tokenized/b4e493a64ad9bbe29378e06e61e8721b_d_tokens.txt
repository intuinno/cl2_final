Some people only update their status with complaints , whines , and f *** my life stuff . You're jumping into a cesspool of sarcasm to complain and frankly we all learned life is a bitch at about the age of 1 . If it's possible for you to change something for the better , or something we can't change , but all have to deal with together don't bitch about it .

I bought a Bissell steam mop . I opened the box , filled the tank and plugged it in . I waited for the light on the front to turn from red to green . After 30 mins I decided to call customer care . I told the lady after 30 mins the light was still red . She said well whats the problem ? I said , well it still hasn't turned green . She then told me that the red light is illuminated when the machine is ready . I'm an Idiot . 
Spent the day with < PROPFEMALE > and all 4 of the kids today . I forgot how much I missed hanging out with her :) 
Discussing the new < PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland with my oldest daughter .. would love to know what everyone thought of the movie ? And if u thought it lived up to Burtons other work ?

IN MEMORY of all babies born sleeping or whom we have carried , but never met , or held in our arms . Make this your profile status if you or someone you know has suffered the loss of a baby .

May 11 , 2000 . Rest in Peace with daddy my angel .

People need to understand that children with special needs don't have an illness , so there is no cure & it's not contagious . They only want what we all want , to be accepted . Most of you probably won't copy and paste this . Will you do it and leave it on your status for at least an hour ? It's Special Education week , and ...... this is in honor of all the kids who need a little extra help & understanding . 
I dont have a drinking problem .. The only time I drink by myself is when Im alone . What ???

Please put this on your status if you know and/or love someone who is straight/gay/lesbian/bi/trans or who even doesn't fit into any of those categories . By celebrating and remembering days like today , we get closer to the day when people of all sexualities and genders are treated equally , and the murders and suicides of people forced to live in a world that doesn't accept them don't have to happen anymore . 
hmmm think me will be goin to Long < PROPFIRST > Sivers for me dinner .. arrrrrg !!!!!

I think I'll take a moment , celebrate my age , an ending of an < PROPFEMALE > and the\ 
turning of a < PROPFEMALE > . Now it's time to focus in on where I go from her . Lord have mercy on my next thirty years . In my next thirty years I'm gonna have some fun . try to forget about all the crazy things I've done . Maybe now I've conquered all my adolescent fears and I'll do better in my next thirty years .
