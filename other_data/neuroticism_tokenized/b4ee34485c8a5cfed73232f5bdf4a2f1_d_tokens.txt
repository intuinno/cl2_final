Strangers -> Acquaintances -> Friends -> Best Friends -> Crushes -> ? \ 
\ 
i'm pretty sure thats how it went 

A special way of being close that two can truly share , \ 
A special touch of tenderness that shows how much you care , \ 
A special way of knowing that someone is always there\ 
A special kind of friendship that is shared by two alone , \ 
A special kind of joy like no one else has ever known , \ 
That is love \ 
& Today cherishing all those listed above , \ 
On your birthday my love . \ 
\ 
Happy Birthday < PROPFEMALE > ? I Love You 
When you truly care for someone , you don't look for faults . You don't look for answers . You don't look for mistakes . Instead , you fight the mistakes . You accept the faults & you overlook excuses . The measure of love is when you love without measure . There are rare < PROPMALE > s that you'll meet the person you love & who loves you in return . So once you have it , don't ever let go . The < PROPMALE > might never come your way again
