SAT Score :) 750 reading 680 writing 680 math woohoo ! 

Does anybody have photos from Taming of the Shrew ??? If so post them please ! 
three sunburns , one thousand bugbites , four spiderbites , I'm pretty sure poison < PROPFEMALE > in awkward places , a lost toenail and swollen ankle , one tic ( didn't attach it was just on me D: ) and a rockin ' smexy tan ... Deborah survived girl's camp ! 
got her permit !!!! 
is sooooooo excited ! International Thespians NEXT WEEK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
got back from International Thespians on Sunday !!!! It was AMAZING !!! saw < PROPMALE > school of the arts perform urinetown , and while they did basically clean our cookie jar , they left some crumbs . Their choreography was incredible but female vocals and acting were lacking and I really think we can rock this show !!! :) sorry , no pictures , my stupid phone camera broke 
my phone went supapsycho- so i got a new one- same number but i couldn't transfer any of my contacts because my old phone won't turn on . :( so everybody text me so i'll have all of your < PROPFIRST > 
is freakin out ! so much homework , so little time left to procrastinate !!!! 
quit her job ... probably a bad financial decision but God comes before Goodwill - also there is a difference between having a life and having attitude . 
can't think of a status because she's tired ... what's up ? 
bought a new yellow hat from Gambia at the ethnic festival :) i will wear it on monday 
sigh , it's not vegetable soup if it has dead kittens in it , < PROPFIRST > . 
This is going to be an awesome show ! But why do I keep getting old ladies ?? Lol :) 
beat portal and the cake is NOT a lie . 
two teachers freaked out and yelled at my class two blocks in a row . wierd day of angry vibes 
this is my hood side 
i have the soul and voice that can only come from two hundred years of black oppression . thanks < PROPFIRST > ! 
he has one ... two ... two men . and we're all so poor ! lol 
< PROPFEMALE > puns/idioms . Bees knees , busy as a < PROPFEMALE > , birds and the < PROPFEMALE > s , < PROPFEMALE > in your bonnet , none of your < PROPFEMALE > swax , < PROPFEMALE > -line , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > , floats like a butterfly stings like a < PROPFEMALE > - is there anything else ? especially in other languages , let me know . 
uggh math !!! 
I've either gotten really good at debate or really bad at it . 
well , welcome to the family < PROPFIRST > . :) . Laughter is the best medicine . 
I think I'm getting too in character . I've started complaining about all sorts of old-lady aches and pains and if my wrinkles aren't permanent yet , they will be soon . Also I have Alzheimer's . 
poop officially in a group ... as of next monday . Promise . 
Here at Super simple science stuff we know that God is the ultimate scientist 
I officially suck at skating . Poise is not my forte . 
I'm no good at battling 
Cashews are the greatest . They are the nuttiest nuts of all the nuts . 
wins . Suck it < PROPFEMALE > . 
putting together my < PROPMALE > portfolio . Where has everything gone !? 
What doesn't kill me doesn't make me stronger . It just wears me down for whatever will :) 
I love the chicken taquitos at Quik Trip ! 
Two pens , one wrist and seven pages ( double sides ) later it is official that Tayo and < PROPFEMALE > live in racist communities . 
disappointment . One point from finals . NFL national qualifier . :.( 
week ... what happened to you ? 
I wish I spoke yiddish . 
theatre in the park callbacks !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! sound of music !! 
i am not a manatee 
sorry this is just a little bit late but it still makes me laugh ... What would < PROPFEMALE > do with < PROPFIRST>'s donut creamer ? 
< PROPMALE > test this morning ! wish me luck ! and Thanks alot random stupid lady at the IB church who decided she wanted to get in a power play and now i have to set up my whole portfolio the morning of my morning test and i'm having nightmares of global pushpin crises !!!! 
it is a tragic irony when one , unable to resist the temptation of messing with her sister who forgot to log off her facebook , in turn forgets to log off her own account immediately after . 
insomnia three nights in a row . that's probably not healthy 
St. < PROPFIRST > U . is literally a block away from the fox theatre . Fall 2011 ... Lion < PROPMALE > national tour ! do I smell a potential ticket taker/usher/screwitevenjanitor job that would also entail free broadway shows ? I think I might 
might get free senior pics . life is nice :) 
This man is nothing . This course is nothing . If you want something , go find a better class . And when you find one , you'll be an actress . And I assure you that's what finally came to pass . 
Just discovered that C : makes a way happier looking smiley face and is easier to text than (: 
Yay ! Just found out that my grandparents will be coming to graduation . I had assumed they would be a bit too feeble to make the trip from L.A. 
I have , after careful and prolonged consideration , decided that I would rather be < PROPFEMALE > the Pooh than the < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > . I want to live on an island of < PROPFEMALE > . 
had a lovely day . Haircut , s pedicures , and new clothes may not be keys to happiness , but they certainly help :) 
I think it's a little creepy how facebook will pull key words from your status and bring up related pages . it's kind of big brother is watching 
Hypocrisy is officially the thing I hate most . Christ's main problem with the pharisees was that they followed the law in public but didn't love God in their hearts . So if you want to celebrate pagan fertility rituals or how great commercialism and greed are for the economy , more power to you . But please don't be a biannual Christian . 
why is my family so far off the charts in dysfuctionalness ? I can't wait for college ! 
1500 bucks richer :) go procrastination ! 
come on IB have < PROPFEMALE > , I need a month not a week ! 
everything is better with cheese . If you can think of anything that isn't better with some form of cheese , let me know . 
Just got super creeped . Some random unfortunate looking guy sent me a message from which I surmised that he considers facebook a dating site . EEEEEEEEWWWWWWWWWW !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But apparently I look like a nice person ... so ... 
Nothing better than a good old fashioned lovefest . IBers I love you all ! 
found an episode of criminal minds that I hadn't seen yet ! 
ghaar ! papier mache takes so long to dry ! 
Hey everybody !!! Before you go enjoy one-acts on Friday night , hit norclay from 4-7 and see the < PROPMALE > show . I fully expect an influx of compliments . 
me : urgh ! I didn't write my conclusion paragraph . I suck ! \ 
< PROPFIRST > : took you long enough to realize\ 
me : ow , why the hurtful ? \ 
< PROPFIRST > : < PROPFIRST > wasn't here so I figured someone had to insult you 
Wishing more than ever that the world was run by theatre kids and IB kids and everyone else who knows that drama should only exist in plays , kindness is the only way to effect change , and intellligence brings more power than strength . The rest of the world sucks . 
Huh , watching 30 rock all night did not increase my understanding of the Arab-Israeli conflict ... darn ! 
super grateful for my mom's awesomeness . trust me , everything cool about me is inherited . 
< PROPFIRST > Ly -> < PROPFEMALE > , don't graduate or I'll have to cut off your feet ! 
I sent a pic of my dragon mask to < PROPFIRST > Reeder ( youtube artist that inspired it)he sent this back\ 
Hi Deborah , \ 
That is a great mask ! Fantastic job ! I'm amazed that you could use the video and make such a great project first time out . Amazing . It just means you have a knack . Thank you so much for sharing this with me ! Good luck on your next project . Surely there will be a next project , right ? \ 
Keep in touch . - < PROPFIRST > 
fmk with historical figures ... yeah ... it happened 
you know you're a nerd when all you want to do is go to a library or a quiet place and study for paper 3 and your mom forces you to go to the mall instead . 
I just love everybody right < PROPFEMALE > . If I love you , you know who you are , unless I have inadequately expressed it in which case , if you are reading this I love you . 
I'm not really sure what to do with myself this summer , so if you have ever claimed to love me you had better < PROPFEMALE > out with me over the summer , otherwise I might cry . 
putting up my < PROPMALE > stuff in my room now that I have it and my thumbs hurt from the thumbtacks . 
4got 2 log out which shall result in me now officially becoming a victim of everything I say becoming my wall post !!! Mwah hahahaahahaha haaaaaa !!!! 
well , my bedroom is exactly the way I want it for the rest of my life . Too bad I'll only be in it for a few more months . :.( 
Suck It IB tests ! I win ! You suck ! WHOOOOOOOOO !!!! 
WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Nothing better to remind you that your ib bubble has popped than listening to arroogant americans claiming that we're the best country in the world and that absolute truth is undebateabley absolute . 
I'm not pms-ing . Everybody is just being more annoying than usual :) 
Read a book for pleasure for the first time since last summer . Interestingly , it was much much longer and for the most part used slightly bigger words than half what we read in english , but I finished it in a day . huh ... 
made homemade baguettes and chicken soup from scratch today . Yum ... I have skills . Considering trying to make fondue for the first time tomorrow . 
So my friends list on the side thingy just showed all my asian friends at once ... 
Working on a new story . Its way on the dramatic dark side especially for me , so there are a lot of sarcastic little comments in the margins :) but I think it's a good one . It's the last four good ideas I've had for stuff combined . 
\Pretty is as pretty does . You'd be gorgeous if you weren't such a biatch\ " thanks < PROPFEMALE > Baxter . " 
DO NOT MISTAKE MY APPETITE FOR APATHY !! \ 
Thor was good . 
Came up with a title . Baby steps but life is nice :) 
dear hot , go away . Thankyou 
< PROPFIRST > Ayers will like this . \The < PROPFEMALE > spirit is kind and gracious and full of ... LUNAR GOODNESS !... My first girlfriend turned into the < PROPFEMALE >.\"" 
She is the me I wish I could be . 
I have a fort . It is really big and I am inside it right < PROPFEMALE > . So far in my fort have been < PROPFEMALE > Marie-Nichol Platt , < PROPFIRST > Ayers , Lis Christensen who half built it , < PROPFIRST > Noland , & < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > . The fort will be up for a very long time because it's freaking awesome . It has many rooms , caves , & tunnels & is made of blankets . That is all . 
is getting really upset with SLU's craptastic and indecisive technology . Email should not be this hard to log in to . 
portfolio or another dragon ? hmm ... one is messy , one takes decisiveness ... 
Hacked ! By Sir < PROPFIRST > Noland the IV . Take that society 
Got a job at Hancock Fabrics . Take that society ! I'm contributing to you ! 
Found yellow and black striped fabric for cheap at Hancock ... oooh what can't I do :) 
I have now seen all the < PROPFEMALE > wars movies . I know I'm going to get a lot of flac for this but I actually prefer the new ones . Its not even the cgi ( though the puppets in the old ones are pretty funny ) I really think the story is better . 
worlds of fun with Karolina Kosinska and < PROPFIRST > Noland :) of course an atheist and a polish don't already have plans for today :) 
34 . straight 5s and 6s . ( ps since when am I better at math than english ?? ) alright :) but it doesn't keep the baby I'm holding while I text Dr. < PROPMALE > from spitting up on me not once , not twice , no not even thrice ... I now have a shirt that not even I can wear again 
You know what week , I hate you . I have so far broken , then lost my glasses , lost half my theare portfolio the 3 days before I have a scholarship app due , andlost my internet at home . If anyone happens to randomly have a picture of the < PROPFEMALE > over buffalo display case , or any GOOD phots of the utown set please please let me know . 
ok , got my scholarship app in , life is considerably destressed , but it is silly that it took that amount of absurdity in the first place . 
I read books ! 
Wow < PROPMALE > Gutierrez and < PROPFEMALE > Wegenka you are almost as silly of girls as I am beautiful an enchantress :) ( for reference ... that is a lot of silly ) 
AAAAHHHHHHH !!!!!!!!! Life is instantly awesome as I have just recieved a theatre scholarship for exactly the amount I was still short . the stress I felt until just now is probably my just desserts for procrastination but fosho worth it . 
I want my stupid hair to grow back out . Its at that dumb length where its hot in the summer , but too short to pull back . :( 
Argument with mom\ 
M : \homosexuality does not exist in the animal kingdom\ " \ 
I hate banks . Its like a building full of people just looking for creative new ways to be mean to me . especially citibank- worst customer service I've ever experienced . However life works out and now I have a little bit of money which is nice . 
I have not slept much this week . 
New roomate 
If you live off of North Oak between 72nd street and < PROPMALE > Road I just delivered your phonebook . :) ( note to self , never deliver phonebooks again , it is a workout ) . 
Last day home . yo world ! Y'all ready fo this ! Bah nah nah da da dadada dada da da da dada da da . 
I've never done an audition with prepared monologues before ! I'm so used to cold readings . Wish me luck as I don't know what I'm doing I'll need it ! 
Come on work study , somebody has to email me back right ? I need money !!!!!! 
My stagecraft professor is a mormon !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
just switched from Spanish 415 to Drawing 1 . IB work ethic , where did you go ?? 
Dear Catholics , \ 
Thank you very much for cancelling my only class today because of \mass\ " and then not telling me about it 
Well look at that ... slutheatre company assignments have been posted and I was utterly surprised ( though delighted ) to see that I am the only scenic painter for the entire semester . \ 
As to why I was surprised , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > only knows ... 
I learned more today than all week in classes ! Spent my afternoon in the sceneshop , a new world of ALL THE COLORS of paint and tints and sprayguns , and multiple clean brushes , sand mixed with latex paint to create a stone texture on top of wire mesh framed over plastic sheeting and have awesome backlit shadows , tools that work , saws that sense fingers , and pro scenic designers offering to take me to jobsites and assist , and getting me over my fear of computer aided drafting ! If this is day one ... 
Okay bookstore . Here's the deal . A . you charged me $200 too much for books I didn't need . B . You wouldn't let me return them the other day because I didn't have the reciept . and C . Now you're telling me that you consider the saturday before an insignificant holiday also a holiday , you won't be open until Tuesday ? Not cool B&N , not freaking cool :( 
Today it is against the post office that I gripe . I am officially out of snackage and while my dear mother foreseeing in her many wisdoms that such must eventually come to pass and therefore having sent a care package well stocked with both love and said snackage for which I crave almost TWO WEEKS AGO , the post office has to **** everything up and not gimme my nom-noms ! Not cool post office , not freaking cool 
does anybody know how the fafsa website works ? I thought I qualified for work-study , but now I want to double check and I don't know how to find out :( 
Attention : people who think it's acceptable to wear leggings as though they were pants . \ 
It's not . \ 
Don't . \ 
Gross . 
best feeling in the world ? SCHOOLING misogynistic douchebags at powertools . 
all play , no work 
oh , homework , I thought we had a deal . \ 
You would be a small amount , and I would get you finished . 
Okay lying bitch at McDonald's . Here's the deal , I did not walk in the rain all day yesterday to have you 1 . tell me that you don't give out applications anymore , and two lie to me so that I would walk a mile today so that I could be asked to describe your appearance to an angry owner who informed me that no , you are not hiring . 
tiiiiredd 
whadup stagecraft test ! I just pizzowned you ! guess who can tell the difference between a saw and a stapler ? This girl ! 
I love being home :) ! I missed you family :( 
Prefects are really hot , In every season , you know they call me Moaning < PROPFEMALE > for a reason ! \ 
I just discovered wrock . \ 
because I wasn't nerdy enough already 
Phone ... broken . Not cool . :( < PROPFEMALE > Baxter I would have informed you in some other way , but unfortunately , this is now my only mode of communication . 
WOOHOO ! Got a job ! ( only took me a month but there you are ) 
Loving how my first five stories are about my fantabulistic baby sis Lis < PROPFEMALE > Christensen . Miss you < PROPFEMALE > bunch 
< PROPFEMALE > Flynn is the most beautiful , awesome amazing person in the whole wide universe and I now owe her my soul . Thank you darling :) 
just terrified a campus tour ;) 
Hello friends of mine . This is very very important , I just got a new phone , and I don't have anyone's < PROPFIRST > , so if you want that I should have your number , text me your name . ( my number is still the same ) 
I feel like a loser . If you want me to have your phone number , text me 
GIVE ME YOUR < PROPFIRST > !!! 
Today sucks . I'm exhausted , missed half a midterm , and am double checking more often than seems strictly necessary that I did in fact graduate seventh grade . Thanks < PROPFEMALE > Barzee for cheering me up :) 
Let's hope this all nighter succeeded in engraving the entire American legal system on the inside of my skull . What ? I have a theatre midterm today too ? I guess I can squeeze studying for that in like the minute after law . wish me luck ! 
Sweet , 8 am class tomorrow about which I was concerned with whether I could finish my homework in the allotted time , cancelled . :) 
Whoo ! Cards !

Naked Woman in my Bed < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > 
TIRED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Going to see < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > tonight at the fox . 20 dollar tickets what what 
Fantastic . Though not what I had expected . 
Make a wish ! 
Fantastic show ! Really really great NKC you done me proud . Lis < PROPFEMALE > Christensen you were the bestest , prettiest , most kickass secretary ever to grace the stage ! 
I want to go on a large road trip from Boston to just west of Gladstone with < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > , Karolina , Lis and < PROPFIRST > . 
Does anybody want to give me a ride to union station on Saturday morning ? Or walk with me ? I'd rather not walk alone and be raped ? 
It is the most freeing feeling in the world to not give a shit . 
took public transportation ( with ... black people !... ) this morning in the dark in downtown St. < PROPFIRST > . I was fwightened . 
I'm home !!!! I love you family ! ( and yes I'm including my dears < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > ) 
There is nothing , nothing at all that is more annoying to me than stupid people with opinions . Except stupid people with opinions who feel the need to talk ... very ... very ... slowly . 
gahr ! IB kids never fail to be awesome ! I love you guys !
