so skipping practice monday

100 foot ( somewhat ice cream-y ) slip ' n ' slide : worth the pain

we were smart kids with too much to say ... who knew we'd get so far ?... they said we burned so bright , we burn the city and go ... 
but stop the take , the sunset still looks fake to me , the hero looks like he can't breathe , the damsel just left everything ... 
FINALLY got that CD to work ..... i miss my mp3 :[[[[[

Young hearts beat free tonight . Time is on your side . 
Uggggggghhh . Tirednesss ... 
going to explode ..... soon 
maybe it should tell me something that my favorite days are the ones where I have seventh period and get home late .... 
Keep your mind on your music so that nobody can refuse it . I said a little bit of rhythm and a little bit of soul and a reason for the mind control . 
Highlight of the week : Busting open the paint locker with a mallet , pry bar , and < PROPFEMALE > . If anyone sees the totally broke locker in the paint deck that says OWNED !!! in permanent marker yeah , that was me . :] 
Anybody goin to the game tonight who wants to chill with me ?

hey you , I gotta tell you my long time friend : I think about those years you saw me through tears and the good times that we spent . Hey you , you're my constant companion . You always let me explain just what I'm sayin ' and we've just begun . 
so kiss me beneath the milky twilight , lead me out on the moonlit floor .....

I'm torn , torn in two by what I should or should not do . Would you wait for me if I run from you ? 
Eight years ago today ... I miss you 
remember my name .... 
What are you doing the rest of your life ? 
...... not again .... 
learning about tattooing laws o_O 
I don't mind spending every day out on your corner in the pouring rain . Look for the girl with the broken smile . Ask her if she wants to stay a while . Tap on my window , knock on my door , I want to make you feel beautiful ... 
If you want to sing out , sing out . And if you want to be free , be free . Cuz there's a million things to be . You know that there are . 
so I'm neverr gonna get this lab report done .... 
has the overwhelming urge to just say it ... 
i thought i was past this .... 
is way too young to be able to tell that it's going to rain by the throbbing of every joint in her left arm . Now she's talking in third person . This is rediculous . 
Methinks these scientists are all much to excited by the prospect of the Earth exploding .... 
we have a lab report due tomorrow . F . M . L . 
it pays to be a creeper :}}}}}}}}}}}}}}} 
just saw Fame .... 
Today my mom told me she wanted to take me to a shrink because apparently eating all my fries first before I started on my burger is a sign that I have a mental disorder . She was dead serious . FML 
my mom trusts me enough to go to a funeral without her . yayy me :/ 
it feels like an ice cave ...... i don't like it 
Now you've gone and pissed me off . Why ? Why would you do that ?

it's a great day to be alive ..... 
dear people who are warm , snug , and asleep in your beds : I HATE YOU 
Yeah I'm the only one who'd walk across a fire for you . Maybe you should think about that next time . 
i wish i could believe these things you tell me . i know i'd be happier . i love you for trying . but stop wasting your time . 
Who wants to see my song ? 
I'm trying to get the pics up < PROPMALE > but facebook is being sketchy 
I've decided that ........ I just don't understand you . Everytime I see you I get a little more confused . And yet ... I keep coming back ? 
God IS great . And He loves you and me . :] 
epic sleep failure 
\Silly Caucasian girl likes to play with Samurai swords . \"" 
I'm glad corny science related pick-up lines make you think of me < PROPFEMALE > :P 
I can figure out the square root of any number in less than 10 seconds . What ? You don’t believe me ? Well , then , let’s try it with your phone number . 
I fail at life .

I love Demi Moore . Watching Ghost :]

Is it really such a crime to look decent without reason ? 
< PROPFIRST > needs more sad songs on his ipod for the times I steal it .... if only I had the money for my own .... 
this ..... can't possibly end well 
you have got to be f***ing with me . I just got locked out of word on my own computer and we have a lab report due tomorrow . FML . 
I love that despite my underclassman-ness I'm always included with the upperclassmen at tech :] I feel special 
This is the story of a girl who cried a river and drowned the whole world . And while she looks so sad in photographs I absolutely love her when she smiles :} 
is confined to her room without her instruments ... :/ 
who would object if I shaved my head ? 
Maybe I'm going to Bishop's Ball ....? If I can ever get my mom to sign me up ! Grrr ... 
There's nothing you can say , nothing you can do . There's no other way when it comes to the truth ... 
Please don't mind what I'm tryin ' to say ' cause I'm , I'm bein ' honest ... 
I made four people cry and left several others , including a professional playwright , speechless with a monologue I wrote in less than half a class period . 
The hardest part of living is just taking breath to stay . Because I know I'm good for something I just haven't found it yet . And I need it . 
Kiss me good-bye , I'm defying gravity and you can't pull me down . 
' Cause obviously she's out of my league . I'm wastin ' my time ' cause she'll never be mine and I know that I never will be good enough for her . 
So testosternone boys and harlequin girls , will you dance to this beat and hold a lover close ? 
Ugh !!!! IRRITATION !!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
I'm just so tired . Won't you sing me to sleep ? And fly through my dreams so i can hitch a ride with you tonight . We'll get away from this place , have a new name and face . I just ain't the same without you in my life . 
You got here just in time to let me know that I was worth saving , if nothing more than for the heart ... And then I flew into pieces .. singin ' , \play me a song it's be too long since I've heard you sing . \"" 
something something something something something about < PROPMALE > 
this is so WEIRD !!!!!!!!! I'm pretty sure there's no way the world is round . It's a cube . It has to be . 
Off to Bishop's Ball !!!!!!! So excited :]]]]] 
wow . by this time next wekk I'll be confirmed ... 
\What kind of green are you waiting for ? \"= Story of my life " 
.... can we just fast forward through tomorrow ? please ? 
This is the story of a girl who cried a river and drownd the whole world . And while she looks so sad in photographs , I absolutely love her when she smiles . ( And all the times you don't Cailey Capelli ) 
Super excited for Sunday :] 
I'm torn , torn in two by what I should or should not do . I'm torn ... Would you wait for me if I run from you ? 
<3 <3 <3 < PROPFIRST > Black <3 <3 <3 
I'd sooner buy defying gravity . Kiss me goodbye I'm defying gravity . I think I'll try defying gravity and you can't bring me down .

I'm just so tired . Won't you sing me to sleepand fly through my dreams ? So I can hitch a ride with you tonight and get away from this place , have a new name and face . I just ain't the same without you in my life . 
Hey , hey , what can I say ? I swim your way though the tide pulls us away . I ask you whatcha gonna do ? Oceans apart but I know no one else will do . Two drops in the ocean , just go with the motion dear 
is contemplating a highly complex algorithm ;] 
Tattoos , piercings , belly rings here . I got a brand new tattoo . All the colors in it remind me of you . Blue is for the bruise that you left in my heart , the red is for the color we're about to paint this town ... 
I feel like there was something I was going to do ........ I love random theatre moments :] 
Gabe had better keep his freaking mouth shut . 
just don't tell them I've gone crazy 
That's so like , cheerleader who can't like say smart stuff 
there you go again , being beautiful you 
I've de ided I really hate my hair . Why does it have to be so difficult to find a decent style it will cooperate with ? 
oh such a dilemma ... where's a magic eight ball when you need one ? 
How do you wait for heaven ? And who has that much time ? How do you keep your feet on the ground when you know that you were born to fly ? 
Did your mamma turn white ?

What am I watching ????????? And why is this person speaking jibberish with some spanish bits ......? This is weird . 
on my way to Georgia .... again 
? creeping , creeping , everybody loves creeping ...? * peers over wall * 
The moral this time is * girls make boys cry . * And your name remains the same . All that's changed is this pretty face . 
The greatest people ever : < PROPFEMALE > Culver , < PROPFIRST > R . Canada , Cailey Capelli , and Lavadia < PROPFEMALE > Spaugh . If anyone else was there , sorry I wasn't really ... aware . But I love you guys ! I'm sorry that happened but thank you soooooo much for being there for me . 
I let you in and you infected me . I breathed you in and now I'm in too deep . Don't think I'm getting through . Can't get enough of you . http://www.formspring.me/JacobJPurcell 
So . Dang . Tired . Spanish project . Music . < PROPFEMALE > Flower Swanson you're in charge of keeping me awake . 
that . WAS CRAP . 
I built this house with my own hands but she just came and heard the plans . She found the key and cracked the code . She grabbed the goods and hit the road . And I'm feeling dumb . Oh , girl , you're the one ..... I will dig a hole and lable it love . I'll trick her to fall in from above ... 
Hey < PROPMALE > , could you try and be more of a biggot ? K thanks . 
I dedicate this day to learning new songs . Any requests ? 
Five foot six and damn she was built , I slammed on the brakes , got sideways and told her \get in\ " .... http://www.formspring.me/TasteMyRainbow1 " 
I'm just so tired . Won't you sing me to sleep ? And fly through my dreams , so I can hitch a ride with you tonight and get away from this place , have a new name and face . I just ain't the same without you in my life ..... And melodies in the air , singin ' life just ain't fair . Sometimes I still just can't believe you're gone . 
I wish I could follow you invisibly and read your mind .... 
It's really good to hear your voice sayin ' my name . It sounds so sweet coming from the lips of an angel . Hearing those words , it makes me weep . And I never wanna say goodbye . 
\Why do you only wear one ? \ " \ " I hate even numbers . \ " \ " Fine do you promise to wear all of them every day if you get a third\ " \ " YES !!!!!!!!!! \ " End of story . " 
I think .... I'm officially hooked

< PROPFEMALE > Flower Swanson , where is my new profile picture ??? 
So glad I can put all this < PROPMALE > stress behind me . Now the only < PROPMALE > even t coming up is my birthday ! Woot ! 
\Why is your car key in my pants ...? \ " \ " Do you really want to know ? \ " \ " Yes . \ " \ " Because I'm turning you on !!! LOL\ " * facepalm * only you Cailey Capelli ... only you .. " 
Alright . Who changed the greeting on my phone ? Now when I turn it on it scrolls \You Know I Love You\ " . I don't care that much but I'd at least like to know who it is that I supposedly know loves me so much . " 
BEST . MOVIE . EVER . <3 
I'm sorry < PROPFIRST > Camilo Herrera but facebook has failed me yet again . I'll try to get them up tomorrow .

Youth Sunday tomorrow . We gonna tear it up ! 
The fun and freedom of summer nights : more intoxicating than any tangible substance

Relax girl , turn down the lights . No one can see you shining . Relax girl , it'll be aright . No one can stop you if you try . The point of rhythm is to follow it in time so just listen to the beating in your mind . Just remember if you seek then you shall find . There's a fire in your eyes and I hope you let it burn . There's a scream in your voice and I hope you will be heard . 
WANTED : Photos of any show I have acted in , helped build set for , or worked/designed lights for . REWARD : I will love you forever and send you postcards from Governor's School XD 
WANTED : Photos of any show I have acted in , helped build set for , or worked/designed lights for . THAT MEANS < PROPFIRST > Pan , Arsenic and Old Lace , Voices from the Storm , ( My ) Senior Scene 2010 , Follies 2010 , and/or anything else you think I might like . Tag me in them or email them to me . 
Ugh 
In the words of @Gibson < PROPFEMALE > \Flu GTFO \"" 
Needs to stop associating with underclassmen . * shakes head * 
It's things like dance competitions that make people realize why suicide bombers become suicide bombers . 
This just made my day . < PROPFEMALE > spilled her coffee and then starts muttering \derp derp derp \"." 
Don't worry . Just bear stuff . 
Sitting for the SAT this morning .... wish me luck ! :/ 
Time change ....? No one told me ! 
Fbook status cannot capture the awesomeness that is my jam of the day . Kings of < PROPFIRST > - Be Somebody . Do it now ! 
Thanks for all the birthday well wishes ! 
Had a great day . Thanks to all you who said happy birthday . It was nice hearing from some of you old friends . Glad you're still thinking about me ! 
Birthday snow you're a day late and NOT APPRECIATED . Go awayyyyyyyy ! 
I just want back in your head . I'm not unfaithful but I'll stray ... when I get a little scared . 
massively missing all my old Georgian pals ......
