If anyone wonders why there are more pics of my dogs on here than there are of my kids , it's because < PROPFEMALE > takes all the good pics for her < PROPFEMALE > ! 

Ready to go to work and then work overtime tomorrow . Then paint the living room on Saturday !! Whooohoooooooo ! 
What do you do when your nosey old lady neighbor calls the cops on you because your dog barks at people who are staring in her windows ? I don't know what you would do , but I moved my burning barrel near the property line , filled it with dog crap and set it on fire !! Now she has crap scented smoke saturating her bedroom , and I have a smile on my face . :) 
I'm tired and tired and tired . My little cousin got married and looked beautiful and that is the only good thing about this weekend . Did I mention I'm tired ? 
Feeling thankful for my wife and kids . Without them I'd have nothing worth living for except pie , and then I'd be fat . Thank you God for my family and pie ... but especially my family . 
I'm gonna get so drunk and then puke it up , drink my puke , have a few more shots , pass out , piss myself and then vomit all day tomorrow !! Good times .... j/k 
I'm afraid I won't be puking all day because I hold my liquor like a manly man . But those hot wings are gonna haunt me .... 
I love my new pup < PROPFEMALE > . She's got drive ... 
I think it's sad when the government decides that the best way to help the poor to afford health care is to fine them if they can't buy insurance and help the < PROPMALE > insurance companies make even more money by institutionalizing their grip on society . Obama thou hast slain me . I am slain and fined for not having insurance . Slain I tell thee ! I am so F***ing slain . Prithee I say could some kind sir or lady help me ? 
< PROPMALE > Cheney looks like the penguin from the batman television series starring < PROPFIRST > West as Batman and nobody gives a crap as < PROPFIRST > . 
I wonder why a fly is called a fly ? Other animals move and we don't call them by their form of locomotion . Wait I just saw a Runs !! There goes a crawl !! 
I am Legion ... for we are many . I feel like an automaton lately . Work , Eat , Sleep , Work , Eat , Sleep , Work , Work , Work . I am Legion . 
Lazy Lazy Lazy . I need to go help my wife with housework or get in trouble . Right now . 
We have < PROPMALE > Shepherd and Miniature Schnauzer puppies available now if anyone is interested check out my site . http://crusaderkennels.webs.com 
I found out a day or so ago that I'll be going dayshift on 9/20 can't wait ! Normal sleep pattern here I come !!! 
I think Tucker Carlson is a real Douchebag . 
My wife was taken by her sister to Bloomsburg to be driven insane by the caterwauling of a mad toadlike man ... goodtimes were had by all . 
Our washing machine is not broken . 
I've been watching animal hoarding shows and can't even believe people are that F*$king crazy . Animals are not more important than family ... they're just more important than strangers . LOL . 
I have been thinking about people and I've come to a great conclusion ... I hate most of them and think they are by and large stupid . Family and friends are exempt from the hate and stupidity . 
I've got Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy and I'm pretty angry . 
Going for a walk or two today . Taking Medea and then later going to take Valkyrie . Fun . 
Our schnauzer pups have been born !!! 
I hate going to get puppy tails cut off and their toes pulled off . It just kinda bums you out hearing their little screams while thinking about someone ripping your thumbs off with giant pliers and stabbing you in the ass . 
People are always so sure they made the right decision when really life is a series of bad decisions we just need to make the best of and most of the decisions aren't even ours to make . 
I hate winter . I'm not an Eskimo , Polar Bear , or Winter Olympian . I'm an old man with joint problems and weight issues who has to drive through the slush and deal with idiots and morons . The only good thing is it keeps the Jehovah Witnesses away . 
I never knew Jesus rode a Diplodocus and held an alligator on his way into Jerusalem . Damn Donkey's have some good PR people ... 
Just finished warming up after taking < PROPFEMALE > for a walk . She is so Hound stubborn , but I taught her that the walk ends when I say it does . 
I am home from grocery shopping and getting awesome deals . I came home to find my wife with another man ... Phillipe DuWayne Calderone Montoya < PROPFEMALE > . I am feeling so betrayed ... Why < PROPFEMALE > ?!? Why ?!? 
I went to TSC and got a good deal on a woodstove for the kennel . Everyone wanted to pet < PROPFEMALE > and asked what kind of beagle she is . I almost hate telling them she's not a beagle at all because then they look like they really feel stupid . Also bought a new tow hitch and some dog bowls . I love it when people compliment my pups . 
The best way to train a dog is with food . 
I love the dogs , but I hate cleaning up after them and I really hate preparing for this horrible storm we're supposed to be getting . 
I miss my niece . Where is she ?!? 
I think I've caught the Bieber Fever ... and I've been puking and have had diarrhea ever since . 
Puppies have begun opening their eyes . They're so cute at this stage . 
I can't wait to see Candrew and < PROPFEMALE > today ! I get to give her a gun and a puppy ! 
I just made Pigface soup and it is an orgasm of fatty deliciousness . 
I didn't even know that the Super Bowl was on today until I got online . Now that I know I'll probably do the same thing I'd have done earlier ... not watch the Super Bowl . 
< PROPFEMALE > asked me why I have a fat belly . I had no good answer . Children are so cute in their cruelty . 
Don't be stupid , be a smarty , come and join the Nazi party ! Gotta love < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > . 
Going to < PROPFEMALE > on Saturday . Taking the boys and my cousin < PROPMALE > to go get a new brood bitch . Going to be fun provided everything goes as planned . 
Put a wood stove in for my dogs and now the kennel is nice and warm . Happy Dogs = Happy Puppies = Happy Customers = $$$ = Happy Zach . 
Went and got my new Schnauzer Stud dog today . We're calling him < PROPFIRST > and he's super cute . 
Puppies are toddling around and they are so cute . < PROPFEMALE > loves < PROPFIRST > and says he's her dog . All in all a good day so far . 
Just bought my wife another shiny thing to keep her interest . Check it out on her < PROPFEMALE > . 
Paperwork , paperwork , paperwork . Running a kennel isn't all fun and puppies . Next up cleaning dog crap . Gotta love it . 
I have felt an incredible enlightening . I believe my third eye has opened ... 
Company today . < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > !!!, and other . 
I learned today that fossils are all only as old as < PROPMALE>'s ark ! Jesus rode a tyranasaurus and < PROPFIRST > rode a tyranadon . I bet < PROPFEMALE > was friends with a dimetrodon . 
I'm still tired from Kentucky . Trying to find a home for a very large male < PROPMALE > Shepherd who is not for the unexperienced home . Anyone interested give me a holler . 
Begining spring cleaning today . Need to get some stuff taken care of and plant some new grass . 
So I'm going to be tearing out carpet and putting laminate flooring in what will be our dining room . This upcoming week I'll be splitting a room in the kennel to be better utilized . 
Watching Idiot Abroad . I love that show it is so honest . 
I hate snow , I hate wind , and the only thing I hate more is the two together . 
Going to take a dog for a walk and try to get some stuff done around the house . 
Whatever happened to Aqua ? 
When will spring be sprung already !!! I hate snow , rain , and mud ! 
I love my kids , < PROPFEMALE > told me I smell like a baloney after I asked her for a kiss and hug and burped while she was coming to give them to me . Needless to say no kiss and hug for daddy ... :( 
Ready to help clean up my Uncle's property again today ! Hello Chainsaw here I come !! 
Happy 11th anniversary < PROPFEMALE > !! I love you more than anything , thank you for putting up with me . 
Corned Beef and Cabbage . Mmmm I love corned beef and cabbage . 
So < PROPFEMALE > just said that Menstrual Cramps are like a crazy invisible midget with shiv running up to stab you in the ovaries every couple minutes ... what a visual ! I'm so glad I'm a guy . 
Finally got a good days sleep . Hate working third shift again , but love that I'm back to work . 
TGIF !! I have so much to do today ! 
Just got back from shooting mynew . 22 cricket with the kids . Paden and Connor hit the target a few times , < PROPFEMALE > just kept shooting the target stand , and < PROPFEMALE > is a little sniper with open sights . LOL I love my family . 
I'm so sick of work , been back to work for a week and a half and already working 10 hr days and overtime on the one weekend < PROPFEMALE > and I were going to have the kids away . That sucks hairy yak c*ck .
