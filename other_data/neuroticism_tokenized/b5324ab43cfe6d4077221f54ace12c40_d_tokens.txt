Stick with friends who saw you , when nobody else did . Stick with friends who you can call buttholes , and know it’s a code word for I love you . Stick with friends who look at your mistakes , and think it’s freaking awesome . Stick with friends who don’t care when you’re crying , because they know you’re stronger than that . Stick with friends who were true to you from the very start . 
Im gonna dance like no one’s going to put it on YouTube . 
Sitting in massage chair with kneading action and a vibrating leg rest while listening to classical music makes writng a reasearch paper so much easier . :)
