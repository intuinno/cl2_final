grrraaaaw .... waiting for a package in the mail makes me incredibly impatient . I WANT MY GRAPHIC NOVELS !!! 

Tomorrow begins the new season of the teen drama Secret Life of the American Teenager . Coincidentally the new season of my favorite comedy by the same name starts too 
I've read most of < PROPMALE>'s Divine Comedy ; I've read most of the Canterbury Tales in its original Middle English ; I read books by < PROPFIRST > Barth and short stories by < PROPFIRST > Barthelme for fun , and despite all that The Sound and Fury is still the most complicated thing I've ever read , and it leaves me confused as hell ! 
Radiohead on the Colbert Report ! 
my drive to actually produce work I'm proud of , alongside poor time management will be the end of me this year . 
< PROPMALE > Thompson's HABIBI is out !!!! 
oh sweet breakthroughs ! 
went to go see the Baltimore Orchestra last night . < PROPFIRST > Elgar's In The South is one of the most awesome pieces of music I've ever listened to . 
I love my contemporary literature class . Not only do we have great discussions but the reading has been awesome . Right now we're reading < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > , and my teacher just sent an email saying he might be adding some < PROPFIRST > Barth . This has been a damn good day . 
I have to sigh very deeply every time someone briefly stares at a work of < PROPMALE > and says , \I don't get it . \"" 
there's 4 blocks worth of cold air between me and the school , there are 4 steps worth between me and a very warm bed . 
Oh Google , I love you and your linux compatible software 
awright friends , it's a beautiful day and we're not going to have too many more of those for awhile . I don't care if you say you have work or not , it's Friday and I'm dragging you guys out of your < PROPMALE > caves to enjoy it ! 
saw the rings of Jupiter tonight . Absolutely beautiful . 
friends , freedom , and an analyzed life 
\We're going to make the Amish look like some sort of future space race ! \"" 
essay writing was so much easier before I knew about metaphysics .... 
yay for sleeping until noon ! 
oh yeah , who's in the general greenville area and wants to < PROPFEMALE > out this weekend ? I'll probably drop by Furman at some point 
A PB&J sandwich always tastes so much better on top of a mountain 
i'm really disappointed with the lack of Halloween-related television this year 
back in baltimore by the way 
people should come join me in F215 
I would just like to take this moment to point out that the media would much rather a Pizza Guy be president than < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > . 
so both < PROPMALE > Ellison and H.G. Wells wrote books called Invisible Man . Now I've no idea which discussions I've heard were referring to which work ... 
\Machine . Unexpectedly 
What do you mean my Barnes and < PROPMALE > coupon is not redeemable at your Barnes and < PROPMALE > owned college bookstore . Christ ! You people just can't stand to give a college kid a break can you ? 
Light in August by < PROPFIRST > Faulkner is quickly becoming one of my favorite books of all time . 
Monster Hunter : just when you think it couldn't possibly be harder , you finish the tutorial 
yay ... rain AND snow ... why have not installed a temperature controlled underground transit system for this school yet ? 
still surprises me when there's that webcomic that succeeds at getting worse as it goes along . Not just in writing , they actually get worse at drawing it ... 
if anybody needs me I'll be in F320 until security kicks me out . 
is < PROPFEMALE > gmail not working for anyone else ? the normal mail thing is fine but the gmail is not accepting my password . 
dear smoke alarm , \ 
I got it . I'm a bad cook . You don't have to rub it in . 
oh Vicks Vapor Rub . You are a most beautiful thing in my life right now . 
wow .... there are no illustration classes I honestly want to take , that is frustrating .... 
And the winner for most WTF thing I've read today : Indians , the other dark meat , were saved from extinction by the humanitarian , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . 
2 suddafeds , 1 mucinex , and an advil . It's 3 in the afternoon and we're calling that lunch 
that moment when I realized I could just paint one sheet of each color and then just photocopy it ... glorious . 
I decided that it was not wisdom that enabled poets to write their poetry , but a kind of instinct or inspiration , such as you find in seers and prophets who deliver all their sublime messages without knowing in the least what they mean . \ 
-Socrates 
The Weekenders theme song is < PROPFIRST > by < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > . As if I didn't love that show enough . 
I got chips , salsa , and an < PROPMALE > history textbook . These are the essential components of tonight . 
okay , okay , I just finished and I got to say , Light in August is the best book I've ever read . 
Wants some people to come with him to see the Baltimore symphony tonight . They are playing music by < PROPFIRST > Copland and it'd be a shame for that experience not to be shared . 
Hey still looking for people who would like to go see the baltimore symphony , starts at 7 . 
the harder I try to make my characters not look like me , the more they do . 
okay change of plans , no student discount tonight , but there is tomorrow , show at 3 . I expect you all to be there . 
noooo , NBC shelved Community ! 
I have 80 pages to read and some studio homework that I haven't started and need to get done tonight . So what am I doing right now ? Making brownies , and nobody is going to tell me that isn't time well spent . 
I continue to look at the work of < PROPMALE > Judd as the pinnacle of < PROPMALE > . It's a work of harsh sobering reality . A level of beauty and precision unmatched . I look at it and feel that there is nothing else that need be said . 
All I wanted was some light reading ! What do I get ? Absalom , Absalom ! Gawdammit
