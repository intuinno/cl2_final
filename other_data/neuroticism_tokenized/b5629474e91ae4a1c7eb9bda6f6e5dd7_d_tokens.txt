And also , if there are any 962ers reading this , join DBC Troop 962 ( both < PROPFEMALE > and group ) and the webmaster ( is that you < PROPFIRST >?) should take over admin responsibilities . 
Mass tommorow , yay !

So I got practically my entire family addicted to The Ranger's Apprentice Series . It turns out that my Mom couldn't sleep last night , so she went into my little bro's room , got Ruins of Gorlan from beside his bed , and read until 0200 so she could finish the book . That is truly hilarious .

Troop Meeting !!!!! Today : Rappelling Safety - ' what not to do when you're standing 2 feet away from a 60 foot drop ' , and , ' Paco's story of how he rappelled * upside down !!! * ( yeah , I did =P ) . ' 
Is so glad that his < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Bare is home :D :D :D 
? If you were a beautiful sound/ In the echoes all around/ Then I'd be your < PROPFEMALE > / Then we'd sing along with the crowds/ Beneath the < PROPFEMALE > coated clouds/ Oh strawberry avalanche/ Please crash over me ? \ 
Ah , I love this song :) 
WHAT SHOULD I DOOOOOO !!!!!! :( 
? Sometimes the hardest thing and the right thing are the same ? 
? I don't want to live/ I don't want to breathe/ ' Less I feel you next to me/ You take the pain I feel ( Waking up to you never felt so real)/ I don't want to sleep/ I don't want to dream/ ' Cause my dreams don't comfort me/ The way you make me feel ( Waking up to you never felt so real ) ? 
I never knew/ I never knew that everything was falling through/ That everyone I knew was waiting on a queue/ To turn and run when all I needed was the truth/ But that's how it's got to be/ It's coming down to nothing more than apathy/ I'd rather run the other way than stay and see/ The smoke and who's still standing when it clears 
Should probably get back to work now :/ 
? Give me something that I can believe and then/ I'll share it with the world for everyone to see/ Take away the darkness , all the pain and sadness/ I know it's you that put this light inside of me\ 
I believe in a faith that's strong/ And I believe in a hope that carries on/ Well I believe in these things and more/ Most of all , most of all/ I believe in love ? 
? I feel it deep within , it's just beneath the skin/ I must confess that I feel like a monster/ I hate what I've become , the nightmare's just begun/ I must confess that I feel like a monster ? 
Gets the feeling that < PROPFEMALE > Bare really really really likes Skillet =P .

We thank Thee , O Lord - Philmont Grace 
Psst , < PROPMALE > for the < PROPMALE > Hawkins quote . It cheered me up greatly =) . & I think we both want 2 take over the world . That would b very good . But how about we just share all the countries ? That would be so much easier & altogether more fun lololol . Have fun @ FRESH tonight , I will not be there ='( \ 
& I just KNEW you were a ninja =) \ 
PS < PROPFIRST > Hingsbergen . It is official . I am the Twizzler now . roflroflroflCOPTER ! 
Attn : Troop 962 , there is NO TROOP MEETING TONIGHT . IHN is tonight which means I had better be seeing < PROPFIRST > Galletta , < PROPMALE > Galletta , < PROPMALE > Englert , < PROPFIRST > LeVay lololol FUN !!! =D 
So apparently , u can pick me out of a crowd by :\ 
1 . Looking 4 a bright red hat . ( aka my custom bona fide NYLT issue hat)\ 
2 . That bright green rope & all those pouches I always wear on my belt . ( Um , you mean my ROSARY . And my First Aid < PROPFEMALE > and Leatherman . )\ 
3 . Keeping an eye out for the guy with uber messy black hair that cannot stop grinning . ( Hmm , I don't think I can deny that . . . )\ 
Haha , thanks bro . 
So I was thinking , if I went around w/ a camera crew filming my every move , would I act any differently ? I think I would make a much greater effort to be kinder , more charitable , more loving . But then I realized that God , the only One who really matters , is ALWAYS with me . Have I become so insensitive that I no longer care that He is there ? I hope that I haven't reached that point yet , & I pray that I never will . 
HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA No . 
' s new shield passed it's test runs with flying colors . I let my brother fight me with it yesterday so I could assess any tactical vulnerabilities , and even I can't get through it rofl .

Adoration was funn lol I got two weeks worth of Ad Altare Dei done in an hour =D must be that Holy Spirit XD 
Stayed up till around 0300 last night reading Airman by Eoin Colfer . It is LEGIT . It takes stuff like that to remind me that not every book around is some lousy vampire story ( no offense XD ) . So today , I went and helped out < PROPFIRST > Senecal with his eagle project for 3 hours , so much fun ! Afterwards , we even got to play some classic Halo 2 split-screen ( my bro and I got creamed by < PROPFIRST > but it was all good fun =) ) . 
Feeling a lot lighter than I have felt in days . Still a little disappointed , but I feel FREE . . .

? Who am I ? / That the Lord of all the earth/Would care to know my name/Would care to feel my hurt/Who am I ? /That the bright and morning star/Would choose to light the way/For my ever wandering heart . \ 
Not because of who I am/But because of what You've done/Not because of what I've done/But because of who You are . ? 
? May the words I say/And the things I do/Make my lifesong sing/Bring a smile to you ?

\Courage ... means a strong < PROPFEMALE > to live taking the form of a readiness to die ... A soldier surrounded by enemies ... needs to combine a strong < PROPFEMALE > for living with a strange carelessness about dying . He must not merely cling to life ... He must not merely wait for death ... He must seek his life in a spirit of furious indifference to it ; he must < PROPFEMALE > life like water and yet drink death like wine . \"" 
Happy thanksgiving everybody ! rofl XD

Super Pope kick some serious unholy rear end . 
Note to self : It is not wise to tell your mother that to prevent a sickness relapse , you will only stick to the ' low intensity ' games such as Ultimate and Dodgeball . Then again the very fact that you are going to be staying up all night isn't very helpful in the first place . . .

Wow . Inception was just amazing . 
\The inalienable right to life of every innocent human individual is a constitutive element of a civil society . . . The moment a positive law deprives a category of human beings of . . . protection . . . the state is denying the equality of all before the law .

But the cross , though it has at its heart a collision and a contradiction , can extend its four arms for ever without altering its shape . Because it has a paradox in its centre it can grow without changing . The circle returns upon itself and is bound . The cross opens its arms to the four winds ; and is a signpost for free travelers . - G.K. Chesterton's Orthodoxy
