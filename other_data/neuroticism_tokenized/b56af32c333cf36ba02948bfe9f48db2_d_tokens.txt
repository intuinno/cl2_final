I was so excited to post my New Year Resolution joke until I discovered someone else already came up with the same thing and executed it before me . From now on I'm just going to say whatever comes into my head as soon as it happens ! 

Yesterday sucked , as planned , but today has been excellent . A special thanks to Glee for being amazing , Windows 7 loving me and HP for making a huge 25 inch glossy screen . Together you've made this awesome day possible ! 
You know you're a designer when : you're helping your Grama set up her new printer and you get distracted by the beautiful color arrangement of CMYK . Fact . 
Thank you < PROPMALE > McCallum for revealing to me the awesome-ness that is < PROPFIRST > Crowder Band's \Church Music\ " album ! " 
Tomorrow will be the day I finally install Windows 7 , just to prove < PROPMALE > Cabrera wrong ! 
Time to get crazy and void the warranty on my old Sansa e280 mp3 player with a brand new firmware install from RockBox.org . It didn't have to come to this . All I ever wanted was for my 8GB MicroSD card to work !
