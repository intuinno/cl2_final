I don't know which is worse , The itchy Bug bites or the Antihistamine making me drowsy . I hate being so allergic to bugs ! 

Nothing can make me so mad so quickly like being < PROPMALE > up on . That is instant rage . 
Full extensive eye exam- $15.00 2 pairs of swanky new glasses- $69.95 Not being blind anymore- Priceless . < PROPFEMALE>'s Best was cheap , the glasses are surprisingly cute ( and designer ) , the only downside was not being seen until 6:45 for my 6:00 appointment . 
You want a reason ? How's about \Because \"?" 
13 Hours later : tedious and repetitive grooming has turned my brain into wiggley mush . I got Trichomes in my EYE , it burns . The SMELL is EVERYWHERE . So glad it's all done and gone . Gonna sleep for DAYS . 
and bitches ... Please don't be offended . I only call you bitches ' cause I don't know your names individualy ... 
I've got an idea !... wait ... Nope . 
I'm not sure about today yet . Lunch & shopping to make it better . 
k , so ... I HATE my hair . Lightening it for summer was a cute idea , but it's not working for me . This changes TODAY . 
Regret for the things I've said and done just can't compare with Regret for those that I have never tried

My power going out yesterday turned out to be very lucky . I got to run into so many people , all just doing their thing . Violins in the park , old friends out for a stroll ... friends walking dogs past the bar patio . To see everyone's faces made my ( drunk ) day . ( It's too bad about the Elbow Room ... )

Early in the morning\ 
In the middle of the night\ 
They said two dead boys got up to fight\ 
Back to back , they faced each other\ 
< PROPFIRST > their swords and shot each other\ 
The deaf policeman heard the noise\ 
Said he came and saved those two dead boys\ 
If you don't believe this lie is true\ 
Go ask the blind man\ 
He saw it too . 
Wish me good JOB < PROPFEMALE > 
SIBLING WAR !!! Copy this if you are the best and smartest of your siblings . If this stands an hour without your brothers & sisters protesting , it's true\ 
LOL !!! < PROPFEMALE > Alboth & < PROPMALE > Roggeman & < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE >

So .. I have slowly started learning conversational Turkish . I didn't know what language I had picked up , but it seemed Persian of sorts . After enough time of actually recognizing full words then common phrases I knew enough to look it up . It's Turkish , who knew . So guys at that one store .. I totally heard you . ;) 
2 : am(ish ) Thursday , March 17th ~ Happy Saint < PROPFIRST>'s Day ! ~ So far , I've had beer , things that are green , Ypsilanti UFO's , and even some obscure Super < PROPFIRST > Brothers porn clips . Here's to starting our days off right ! \

Sláinte ! 
It's an Alcoholiday ! lets CELEBRATE ! 
~ The hardest part of how I'm feeling is admitting that he hurt my feelings . I knew better . I'm so pissed at myself . 
Going to the Gym to blow off some steam . like RAAAWRR I'm a bad ass DINOSAUR . ~ don't ask questions just stay out of my way and off of my leg curl machine .

This is not the end\ 
This is not the beginning\ 
Just a voice like a riot\ 
Rocking every revision\ 
But you listen to the tone\ 
And the violent rhythm\ 
Though the words sound steady\ 
Something emptys within em\ 
With fists flying up in the air\ 
Like we’re holding onto something that’s invisible there\ 
Cuz we’re living at the mercy of the pain and the fear\ 
Until we dead it forget it\ 
Let it all disappear 
So .. I'm having a pretty shitty day . Then I hear a knock at the door .. Leave it to my awesome little brother to be on the other side with a single Peach < PROPFEMALE > to make me happy . I almost cried , he's just that awesome . Now , if only I could find a guy to do that . 
Going to Woodruff's for a beer and a Laith Al-Saadi concert . First time in a long time .

Alright now , the Siblings are gone . Time to make dinner for the parents and CLEAN THIS F*ing HOUSE ! I must convince my cat he can come back out of hiding ... Don't know what the plans for the rest of the night are though . 
I had really crazy panic-filled dreams last night . I just took a nap and it started again . I mean , the stupidest craziest dreams . ugh . No rest for the wicked . 
Meladerm Pigment reducers , GLOW2THIONE pills , Dermology skin brighteners , Shiseido skin systems ... This skin lightening process is getting more complicated now that I know what's safe and what is not . And leave it to me to take this challenge in the summer not the winter ... I should start a blog about this , maybe I can be the Guinea pig so others don't have to research so hard . 
Sidetracks tonight . Gonna be an early night though meet us there ! :) 
insert cliche whinny FB bullshit here >>> wha wha wha whoa is me . I hate myself when I'm this moody . It's pointless . 
Good friends are like a can of Emo-Be-Gone . like * spritz * you're over it . LOL 
The hardest part is realizing that all those people inside your head , each pulling in different directions , are you . You are singular . Unfortunately , you are whole . Those pieces you think are missing aren't missing at all . 
Channeling dead gay friends . Fucked up dreams . But why the intense need for coffee ? I don't drink coffee . Dammit < PROPMALE > . 
Got a secret can you keep it ? Swear this one you'll save\ 
Better lock it in your pocket ( Taking this one to the grave)\

A true friend doesn't care when you're broke , being a jerk , what you weigh , if you don't see them for months , if your house is a mess , what you drive , about your past , or if your family is filled with crazy people . Your conversations pick up where they left off , even if they have been months apart . They love you ... for who you are . \ 
~ ( I don't usually do the re-post it b.s but this one is just that true )

switched from Comcast to Direct T.V today . whatever it makes no real difference to me . apparently a $70 difference though for the same things ? cool . I met so many Direct T.V dudes today . some of them not even working , or at my house . odd coincidences . 
I woke up this morning with a migraine , hangover , and New Kids On The Block stuck in my head . For the first several hours of the day anything that was bright , moved , talked , barked , meowed or just plain existed was my mortal enemy . I'm back now , my bad about that . 
Same awesome shenanigans , different day :)

I have a low boredom threshold . It's been all GO GO GO and I'm not very good at STOP . However , I'm working on a great tan . Sunbathing anyone ? 
Not the best day ever ... 
When he yelled at you , I yelled back , when he came at you , I went at him , when he cheated on you I helped fuck with the nasty bitch he was on , when he lied to you I sat while you cried . This is what we do for each other . SO , why are ya back with the cheating lying ass motherfucker and ignoring your girls ? When it happens next time don't wonder why you lost friends . 
Today at The Igor & Red Elvises concert I witnessed a conga line , a belly dancing banana , and snagged Igor's autograph after the show . Good times . :D 
I want something good to die for , to make it beautiful to live .

Working at < PROPMALE>'s in the morning ! 
Dammit ! I don't own anything pink ! 
At WCC bullshitting until my 6 o'clock class ... lame . Out of class & home about 9:30 - such a long day ! hopefully some good news or something happy or possitive will happen and make this day not suck !

Hopefully today is a good day :) 
Gotta get to the Church for the Baby Shower !!! My Lil ' Bro is gonna be a Daddy :) \ 
( who's taking bets on if I burn alive going through the door ? ) 
It's already far too cold for me outside- the curse of being cold blooded . I'm drinking the crap out of some Airborne ( it makes me feel like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde ) and stocking up on some Zicam and other immune system boosters . Hopefully I can stave off the cold that EVERYONE around me has . I suggest you all start doing the same- it's that time of year again ! 
Heading to the gym now ... I'm avoiding the clock , I don't want to know how F*ing early it is .... 
5-ish hours left to this LONG ASS day ! 
Rough morning ... Doing shots of Dayquil like it's Whiskey . 
One Man's unfortunate series of events is this Girl's great news ! \ 
( that made my week ! :) < PROPFEMALE > anyone ? \ 
Now to drop off a very special resume > WISH ME LUCK ! < \ 
Then I get a comfy movie night with my dude :) ahhh contentment .... 
Hey > YOU ! ( me ) stop thinking so much , you can't micro-manage the world . Let people have a < PROPMALE > at doing it right , they might not fuck up ! < calm , breathe , you can let go for a minute ... > Have confidence and faith ! ( expect the worst though , darling , you're not a fool ) 
It's funny that something as silly as pumpkin shaped lawn bags can motivate me to finally do yard work ... 
I'm gonna go walk around campus and pretend I'm not smoking a square , then off to cost controls class ... fun fucking fun . The upside is if it bores me to death , I wont have to do the homework . 
My Bro and Sister are the SHIT ! thank you for saving my ass < PROPFEMALE > & < PROPMALE > !!! 
I've never tried , I only do . 
Devil's night in Washtenaw County and the biggest thing on the police scanner is a large group of disorderly people at < PROPMALE>'s ? Are you kidding me ? Chaos isn't what it used to be . 
This is the night when the gateway between \ 
our world and the spirit world is thinnest . \ 
Tonight I call out those who came before . \ 
Tonight I honor my ancestors . \ 
Spirits of my fathers and mothers , I call to you , \ 
and welcome you to join me for this night . \ 
You watch over me always , \ 
protecting and guiding me , \ 
and tonight I thank you . \ 
Your blood runs in my veins , \ 
your spirit is in my heart , \ 
your memories are in my soul . \ 
With the gift of remembrance . \ 
I remember all of you . \ 
You are dead but never forgotten , \ 
and you live on within me , \ 
and within those who are yet to come . \ 
I now call to all the Gods of death of darkness , of sorrow . \ 
Though I do not love you , I respect you . \ 
Though I do not welcome you , I honor you . \ 
Though I do no invite you into my life , I know you are already there . 
Happy Halloween ! :) 
While on campus waiting for CC class , My lungs gave out . my bro and sister came to save me . I'm on watch right now , we are thinking about me going to the hospital . I don't do hospitals , I hate them , but I'm really not sure that I'm okay this time . I've had a ridiculous bad cough for days now , during a cough attack I stopped being able to get air , it feels like my lungs are really shallow . Is that what asthma is like ? 
Monday strikes again ! At least I made myself go to the gym today . \ 
I wanna go back to the cuddles ! Breakfast Buffet today in < PROPMALE>'s , stop in . 
Gonna < PROPFEMALE > with my Palomino ! Good times <3 
Case of Beer .. SoCo .. Good friends .. another case of beer ... Deny's .. SLEEEEP

Registration for returning students starts TODAY . get on it ! 
Just got back from taking my man to the ER . I'm tired but he's doing better :) \ 
Movie && SLEEP 
I've found inspiration . \ 
So why no words ? \ 
As if this clarity will fade if I nod in it's direction . \ 
So precarious is this moment of contentment , \ 
that nothing is to be done . 
WHAT A DAY ! HOLY CRAP . 4 more hours ? PLEASE end quickly .. I can't take it anymore ! I feel a comma coming on .... 
yeah ... I stay that extra 2 minutes to finish listening to the song .. late or otherwise 
Class is over for the week ! Now for a weekend with my man and friends ! \
