assumed that < PROPFEMALE > Spears ' Poland tour was cancelled because of its prurient nature , only to learn that it was a labor dispute . It would appear that < PROPMALE > has become The Church Lady . 

shot Reddi-Wip straight into his mouth for the first time in his life . Yum ! (<PROPFEMALE>'s horrified . ) 
wonders occasionally why he and < PROPFEMALE > have not been asked to give a talk in church in 10 years . ( Note : We Mormons share the wealth -- everybody gets asked to give a pulpit talk every now and then . Except us . ) 
spoke just a little too soon . Two days after complaining about not giving a talk in church in over 10 years , he and < PROPFEMALE > have been asked to speak this Sunday . They swear they knew nothing of the Facebook post . ( But they DO know Bart/ < PROPFEMALE > are moving so 
is , of all things , the new Chair of the Board of Trustees of Repertory Dance Theatre ( arguably the most important modern dance company in the world -- seriously ) . All of you must now donate money . Right now . Lots of it . ( Go to rdtutah.org and fork it over b 
believes that FaceBook's rumors that he is dead are greatly exaggerated . Merely busy . 
wonders if we just had National Change Your Facebook Profile Picture week and he missed it . 
apparently has many messages on his wall but he has no idea how to get to the *$^&@ thing . 
is a stranger in a strange land . 
is sick of seeing the iPad on Apple's homepage . He wants an update on the Macbook Pro , dammit . 
< PROPFEMALE>'s dad died earlier tonight . He was 84 and at home , having recently returned from a rehab center for gout ( ouch ) . We don't know exactly what caused his death but we were all able to show up soon thereafter to be with her mom . 
has pain in his lower pain . Totally unacceptable . 
Just remembered that he had a Facebook account and ought to do something there . He is , after all , a SOCIAL psychologist . Time to be social . ( Maybe . ) 
< PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE > just underwent a < PROPMALE > parental rite of passage by taking the kids to see Disney on Ice . It was splendid . 
Zoë our 8-year-old got braces on Friday . Little mouth , great big teeth . Maybe we won't have to keep pulling them out . 
Also , < PROPMALE > applied for a sabbatical today to spend the next year learning more about web-based data visualization ... in the < PROPMALE > Department at the U of U , no less . 
Suddenly the world is right again ; the clock that floats on the < PROPMALE>'s screensaver is back in the correct position of the local clock's hour hand ( and not Greenwich time ) . We anal-retentive louts of the world breathe a collective sigh of relief . 
Got a sabbatical . Will spend all next year ( academic year 2011-2012 ) studying computer < PROPMALE > at the University of Utah . This actually DOES connect with my research and analysis responsibilities at UVU . Veeeery exciting ! 
Went to Zion for the weekend : b-day celebration , St. < PROPFEMALE>'s Parade , and Annual Green Jell-O Festival . ( Will post pics of sculpture contest . ) Kids stayed at home with babysitter ! Came in close second in Jell-O slurping contest . Will have to start training for next year . 
Got officially accepted as an undergraduate student at the University of Utah for the fall . ( I mean , I already have a degree , this is for that sabbatical thing that I talked about . ) Nice to have it in writing . 
< PROPMALE > will not only be enrolled in the < PROPMALE > dep < PROPMALE > ment at the University of Utah while on sabbatical next year , he will also be TEACHING a course in the < PROPMALE > dep < PROPMALE > ment ( a course on generative < PROPMALE > and data < PROPMALE > using Processing ) . Whee ! 
The East Coast may be facing Armageddon but I've cleaned out every last bit of my email inbox – not a single unread or waiting-for-me-to-do-something message – so all is well in my world .
