So ... we move back to < PROPMALE > ... and there are Chipotle Restaurants everywhere ! So , remembering that they're supposed to be somewhat like Taco < PROPMALE > Mar , we try it . WOW ! They should re-name the restaurants ' Cilantro'! I kid you not ! Have a little rice in your cilantro ! I like the taste when it's used for flavoring - not when it's the main dish ! So , I won't be going back ... and boy do I miss my Taco < PROPMALE > Mar ! 
So , I finally know what I want to be when I grow up ! A high school science teacher ! Specifically Physics and Chemistry . I'll be starting school as soon as possible to get my Masters in Education . Whew ! Only took me 18 years to figure it out ... =) 
Refuses to celebrate a man known for ' driving the snakes out of Ireland - into the water where they drowned ' - considering there were no actual snakes in Ireland since the last ice age . So , who were the snakes ? The non-Christians . Would you celebrate a day dedicated to anyone else that attempted killing off an entire people ? 
Today over 23,000 teachers were given pink slips in California . In honor of ALL teachers , copy this into your facebook status . Let's honor those who have made an impact in ALL of our lives ! In the comments name a teacher who has impacted you !

Christian\ 
Kane has to be one of the coolest names I've heard ! 
The\ 
A-Team movie ROCKS ! I might have to see it again befoer it leaves the theater ! =)

The women in my life took me out for a wonderful dinner , and a trip to Powell's bookstore for father's day . It was nice being together , making the 6 hour ( round-trip ) drive , getting the books I wanted , and only spending about $25 on gas for the whole trip ! I can seriously get used to 31-34 mpg driving ! Can't wait for 100+ someday ! =) 
I had an egg-white omlet today for the first time . It was a bit weird - the taste was like eating lite eggs . Like the difference between beer and lite-beer . I think I'll stay with my full-bodied eggs from now on . 
Happy Friday , everyone ! =) 
I'm on my laptop while riding the bus and have found that instead of it being cool , It's a huge hassle . Still kinda cool , though ... 
Off to Spokane ! Have a great weekend ! =) 
I think that anyone who claims that God hates , is either a Satanist , or not a Christian . I'm tired of seeing \Christians\ " hold up signs that say that God Hates - and I'm not even Christian ! I'd imagine that this would have to bother true Christians way more than it does me ... right ? What do you think ? " 
What is on your mind ? 
Banana 
Happy Friday the 13th ! =) 
Doh ! More heat ... 
Here is a joke that I just received from a friend and thought that it should be passed along . =) \ 
\ 
To the optimist , the glass is half-full . \ 
To the pessimist , the glass is half-empty .... \ 
To the engineer , the glass is twice as big as it needs to be . 
Um ... Friday . ' Nuff said ! =) 
Pickle 
Just saw this , made me laugh : \ 
Illegal immigration is not a new problem , Native Americans used to call it ' White People ' 
Love actually is , all around . =) 
Lobo Loves You ... for Dinner ... =) 
Bri and I had tons o ' fun at PAX this year ! We go to play the Guild Wars 2 demo ! It was awesome ! Can't wait for that to come out ! =)

Will YOU make this your status for at least 1 hour ? 
\I found my underwear !!! \ " =) "

Happy Turkey Day ! I'd say Happy Thanksgiving , but would have to include the ' Thank you for teaching us how to survive , so let us pay you back by slaughtering all of you ' part of that . So , I concentrate on the Turkey . Good thing I'm not a Vegetarian , huh ? =) 
PLEASE put this on your status if you or someone you know has been eaten by Dragons .

Happy Winter Festival - whichever one(s ) you celebrate . If you don't celebrate any of them , then have a great day anyway . =) 
I was told online today that the only reason I objected to them calling someone else a ' fag ' was because I must be a ' fag'! I replied that bigotry of any type should not be allowed ! Then I proceeded to get him kicked from the group ... booyah ! =) 
I think I already broke all my New Year's Resolutions ! Wait a minute ... I didn't make any ! Can I break that which doesn't exist ? Clearly too much Zen lately ... =P 
A true friend doesn't care when you're broke , what you weigh , if your house is a mess , what you drive , about your past , or if your family is filled with crazy people . Your conversations pick up where they left off , even if they have been months apart . They love you for who you are . Re-post if you have at least one true friend . They will know who they are ... 
Hey ! Keep your Angus out of my burger !
