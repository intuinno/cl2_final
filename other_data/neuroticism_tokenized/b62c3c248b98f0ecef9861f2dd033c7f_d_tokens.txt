The pool with the rays and fish was COLD !

You can have freedom or you can have peace . Don't ever count on having both at once . —Robert A . Heinlein . Indeed , democracy is the ONLY system under which both may be gained and sustained for long periods of time . 
The turn away from ethical monotheism and traditional values in a democracy marks the beginning of that societies decay , until democracy itself dies with thunderous applause . —Valtarov 
A man does not insist on physical beauty in a woman who builds up his morale . After a while he realizes that she is beautiful -- he just hadn’t noticed it at first . —Robert A . Heinlein . 
No state has an inherent right to survive through conscript troops and , in the long run , no state ever has . < PROPMALE > matrons used to say to their sons : “Come back with your shield , or on it . ” Later on this custom declined . So did Rome . —Robert A . Heinl 
Democracy is based on the assumption that a million men are wiser than one man . How’s that again ? I missed something . Autocracy is based on the assumption that one man is wiser than a million men . Let’s play that over again , too . Who decides ? —Robert 
It takes talent to lose against a debater using a horrid psuedocounter-plan that uses Thebes as an example on a nuclear weapons topic . My opponent was quite talented . 
One of the people here has an argument that is a multiple a priori , double conditional counter-plan protect with very good value , criterion , and one argument , that gives him 16 ways to win the debate and whose arguments not only prevent his opponent from 
Anyone want to get together and play ultimate or eat at Chipolte or something on Monday ? It's the only free day I have at this camp ( here at CC ) , and I don't particularly like the idea of spending all of it sitting doing nothing or with certain people he

Okay , nothing has really materialized , so I'm scrapping getting school friends together unless anyone responds . Please message me if you have any part of tomorrow free .

Probably won the first LD round of his life ! That would bring his record to 1-6 ... 
50 cards . Not my fault ( It's not Harsh's either ) . Fickle lab leaders ... 
O great lab leaders , Harsh has sinned , and thus I make for you 49 cards ... 
Just got an extra 40 minutes of sleep . Back to cutting cards and wishing I was at Desperation Conference ...

is headed to bed . I really wish I could have been at Desperation ! Darned schedule conflicts ! 
4th round against someone in 4th lab . Hopefully this will bring me to 1-3 . 
0-4 . Sigh ... 
lost his fifth and final round as well ( so my record is now 0-5 ) because , even though I destroyed my opponent's case ( value , standard , contentions , everything ) , I undercovered one turn on my contention . 
NSD is now over . :| 
I get to go to church in 8 hours ! Yay for Godspeed . I know you all missed me a lot ( okay not really ) . 
Chopping down saplings with a knife =:) 
When/where is XC ultimate romorrow ? 
The schedule changes worked ! I posted my schedule in my notes for those of you that want to compare . 
Fly , envious time , ' till thy run out thy race . Call on the lazy leaden-stepping hours , whose speed is but the heavy plummet's pace , and glut thyself with what thy womb devours , which is no more than merely mortal dross . So little is our loss . So little

Love is born of sharing pain with others . Pain is the shadow that gives the light that is love meaning . 
With eyes that now reflect every color of the sun , that shine with the starlight , I run again , down from that summit , down back into the darkness at the foot of the mountain . But always will my eyes reflect the colors the sun taught me . Forever will they shine that aquamarine that the sun gave me at the summit , the aquamarine that replaced the last sliver of grey . 
walks a blessed broken road , a road that I know will eventually again turn into the mountain path that will take me back to the summit . 
Do not go gentle into that good night Rage , rage against the dying of the light 
What's the homework for AP Stat ?, Chem , and Latin III ? 
It was the best of times because I had not seen the shadow . It was the worst because I had not seen the summit , for to see the summit , to start the journey there , you have to face the shadow . 
Can anyone give me the actual questions for AP Stat ? I left my book at school . 
does not like < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . 
Good job to all my XC buddies who ran at WideField . Sorry I was sick and couldn't come ! 
just spent 11 hours with one of the most awesome people on Earth . < PROPFIRST > Edwards is just one of those awesome people . 
How long is the speech for speech class supposed to be ? 
XC in the rain = fantastic festivity ! 
Just got up from a 5 hour nap , and is still tired . The XC retreat was fantabulonderful , but apparently must be slept off ... Yay for doing stuff until 4 in the morning and getting up at 7 to run ! 
Life is a resource constantly spent . Why then would you then not spend every moment in the desperate pursuit of a < PROPMALE > goal ? Why not live so that that in the laying down of your life ; you may know that you have spent it well , and have not wasted this most precious of resources ? Why not live so that you lose your life to gain it ?

Or , you are a fool to consider me beautiful . That one you will never hear , guaranteed . Except from me ... 
was quite overwhelmed by the sheer amount of something ... wrong in people last night . In their eyes , body language , emotions , various other inputs I get that are too hard to explain , there was something ... missing . It took me quite a while to start having fun because of it . But , the last hour with various wonderful people was amazing . 
realizes how purely governed by emotion people are ... 
Interesting observation : God has three aspects ( the < PROPFEMALE > ) and God is love . Love is three things as well : an idea , an emotion , and an action .

Night bike ride when it's just the right kind of cold ... therapeutic . Especially after driving 4 hours :P 
Really liked Avatar . It was very , very good with only a few things I wish were different with the plot . 
must say that the coolest gift I got for Christmas was the African ceremonial waraxe .

Sock hop was awesome ! 
Let it go , let it roll right off your shoulder . Don't you know ? The hardest part is over . Let it in , let your clarity define you . In the end , we will only just remember how it feels . 
Looking back with you my friend , along this winding way , we've learned a lot of lessons that have brought us to this day . We've walked the straight and narrow ; we've forged our way on through , and like bow or maybe arrow , I am me because of you .

The highest forms of the four loves are much more like each other than their basest forms . The highest form of eros , the affection/attraction love , has much more in common with the highest form of philia than with the basest sexual attraction . Indeed , in God we may find that the four loves become one , and when we get to heaven we will find that the four loves were different shores of the same ocean .

Rejection never tasted so sweet . 
So I will stand in the silcence and pain of the sweet rejection , made sweet by a sweeter surrender , for a glimpse of heaven , and the knowledge that , no matter the consequences , you have fulfilled its claims upon you outweighs the worst pains of hell .

Zach Palermo is brilliant . 
Jesus didn't come just to take away our sins . He came to make us something greater and better than merely good men ; He came to make us Sons of God . He came not to make us really good soil but to pland mustard seeds of the Kingdom of Heaven . Christ came not to make us good men , but new men with life abounding . Joy is the serious business of Heaven . 
Life is like a teacup . 
There are some types of < PROPFEMALE > that are so good that they are better than the fulfillment of any earthly < PROPFEMALE > . Indeed , all other < PROPFEMALE > s and their fulfillments merely arouse it . What is this < PROPFEMALE > for ? It is the < PROPFEMALE > for the home country , for God , for Heaven . It is Joy . 
Every person you meet will in the end either be a wondrous creature that you or I would be tempted to worship or else a creature that is beyond our worst nightmares . Act accordingly . We must do all we can to lead them towards the former and save them from the latter . 
Every soul will look to God as its first love because He is its first love . — C.S. < PROPFIRST > 
He who has everything and God has no more than he who has God and nothing more . 
I must say that , while I didn't really like the portrayal of Zeus and the Olympians and Perseus ' rebellion against them , I liked the story of Perseus presented in Clash of the Titans better than the original myth . The movie is worth seeing if you are at all a fan of Greek mythology . 
The love we share with all , my heartbeat brings resolve . Let's drive a nation to this : bring peace , spread love for all . I wish that we could fly away . I will take you somewhere far away . Come get with it ! Oh so sick with it !

The more I live life , the more I am attracted to the idea of fate , that everything happens for a reason . What if all our ideas of probability , what we call random , was the purposeful actions of God tailored to a million infinitely different and diverse souls ?

The only way that the weak may become strong is by standing their ground and holding on . 
First time officially on FB in a few days . I absolutely loved the 2010 national convention of the < PROPMALE > Classical League . Thanks to all y'all , especially < PROPFIRST > Safadi , for making it one of the best experiences of my life . 
Never would I have thought I would wear a kimono and then a kilt on the same day . Never did I think that I would become fluent in Japanese and Feayran , and semi-fluent in Mandarin , in five days . Never did I think that I could find a group composed entirely of people who are being made new by God . If home is where the heart is , then I've finally found my home . This is home . 
Sometimes in our lives , we all have pain , we all have sorrow . But , if we are wise , we know that there's always tomorrow . < PROPFEMALE > on me when you're not strong ! I'll be your friend ; I'll help you < PROPFEMALE > on ! \

I cannot express my gratitude to all of my wonderful CP friends . You all are so amazing , and through you I have been blessed . Gratias maxime semper vobis ago .

I think we're all too afraid of each other . We fear the unknown , especially when it comes to people . Our cynicism , our assumption that everything not familiar is evil until proven good , has led to unimaginable evil on the level of nations equally with the level of children . We look for evil , and are surprised when we find that which we seek . Were we to search for good in the unknown night , might we not find it ?

Directions : Put down all the colors you feel towards me . \ 
-red : be my < PROPFIRST > this year\ 
-yellow : I used to like you\ 
-blue : I love you\ 
-pink : i want to chill\ 
...... -purple : I like you\ 
-black : I want a kiss\ 
-silver : you're sweet\ 
-white : you're funny\ 
-brown : you're amazing\ 
-orange : you're cute 
Feels like the wind is finally catching in my sails ... 
feels like the snowy night outside . 
is getting busy living . 
\I am not Medea ! \ " ~ < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > " 
I miss my < PROPMALE > friends already ! Goodbye to the first < PROPMALE > mini-moot . :'( . Ok , well , I'm not really crying , but I still miss you guys . August seems much too far away . < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Nikkel 
Was not hugged by much of anyone , even though it's Hug a Tall Person Day :( . Well , at least not because of the day . 
It feels weird to be back in a world where people won't understand me if I start speaking Chinese . 
English buddies : What do I , as the attorney , have to prepare for tomorrow for the trial ? 
I think I'll like < PROPFIRST>'s Day a lot more when I have a < PROPFIRST > . Now I'm just apathetic about it . 
Today kinda was terrible , but I have learned much and tomorrow will be mine . 
My sister is having another surgery done tomorrow . The last one failed . Prayers wanted , needed , and appreciated . 
Y'know , I think the mock trial would have been a whole lot more fun if I hadn't looked like a fool one day , and then hope that I had done well enough to win with a bad case on the second day , only to then be accused of winning only because of dishonorable conduct . I don't mind debate . I do mind the personal insults that followed this one . 
The Importance of Being < PROPMALE > was awesome . 
Is it strange that I feel the most faithfully ( I mean faith in the sense of steadfast and trusting , as the Bible uses it ) and truly Christian after having read an argument against it's truth , and furthest from that same faith and truth when I have just argued for it ? 
Good night , world . 
' s mind is blown . 
Where'd you go my Lord ? 
I really want to go see The < PROPMALE>'s Speech . 
doesn't know how his One-Acts audition turned out . Is being asked to read 6 different parts a good thing ? 
Life sucks . 
Natquals is tomorrow . AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
I have not seen many spectacular things in my life , but seeing < PROPFIRST > Loving win Lincoln-Douglass debate at National Qualifiers was one of them . Also , he gets the prize for best cross-examination question ever : \Did they do it on the plane ? \"" 
??? ??? 
There's something that doesn't love perfection , in people , in appearance . There's something so fake about trying to make things that aren't perfect appear that way , that makes me yearn the world would take off all its make-up and pretty clothes and jewelery and just see the refreshing beauty of the reality of our imperfection . 
\Let us learn to show friendship for a man when he is alive and not after he is dead . \ " ~ F . < PROPFIRST > Fitzgerald . " 
The < PROPMALE>'s Speech is a truly great movie , but not in the way most are . During it , I wasn't all that impressed . There were no great climactic struggles , no great battles won . When I walked out of the theatre , I was struck by a feeling of wonder and hope that most movies can't . It's the type of movie that's like an iceberg ; it's message is subtle . It's simplicity makes it great . 
\Why should I waste my time listening to you ? \ " \ 
\That's right ... I'm hilarious . \"~ Quint Mediate " 
has fallen in love with the music of Mumford and Sons . 
In parody of certain people ( including myself sometimes ) who like to post Bible verse references as their status ... \ 
Acts 1:18 
\'Forgiveness is the act of very brave people . \ " - Fr . < PROPFIRST > Barron " 
\I said to the man who stood at the gate of the year\ 
\Oh 
That was the most traumatizing meal I have ever eaten ... 
Has , by complete accident , already started participating in poetry month , and I'm going to have lots of material if today is any measure .
