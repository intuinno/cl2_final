This week we remember all babies born sleeping , or whom we have carried but never met , or those we have held but could not take home , or the ones that came home but didn't stay . Make this your profile status , if someone you know has suffered the loss of a baby . The majority won't do it , because unlike cancer , baby loss is still a taboo subject . Break the silence . In memory of all lost angels . 
I cannot contain myself ! Slash ! With the BEPs !!!! 
USHER too !!!! 
That was awesome !! Other than the sound glitches it was awesome ! 
To all my teacher friends :\
