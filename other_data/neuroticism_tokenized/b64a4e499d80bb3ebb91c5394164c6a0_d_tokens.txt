Please put this on your status if you know or love someone who is gay . My wish for 2010 is that people will understand that being gay is not a disease nor a choice - people who are gay are not looking for a cure but ACCEPTANCE and EQUAL RIGHTS !! 93% won't copy and paste this . Will ... you ... make it your status for at least one hour ? .... Promote LOVE & Acceptance ! ? 
Going out with \\n G.G. for dinner ... then maybe the game afterwards : \\n <3 ADD

It\ 
is said that ever lasting friends can go long periods of time without \ 
speaking and never question their friendship . These types of friends \ 
pick up like they spoke just yesterday , regardless of how long it has \ 
been or how far away they live . And , they don't hold grudges . They \ 
understand that life is busy , but you will always love them . Repost if \ 
you have at least 1 of them ... Love you girls
