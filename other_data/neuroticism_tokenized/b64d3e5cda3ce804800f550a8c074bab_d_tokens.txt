Heading to NYC to celebrate my grandma's 89th birthday ! ( Non contano giorni , rendere giorni contare . ) 

Enjoying nyc ... times square , central park , museum of natural history .... and people watching ! 
I love Broadway ... saw West Side Story today ... just before the rain came ! 
Visiting the MET today . Love < PROPMALE > museums ! 
If you have a sister who has made you laugh , wiped your tears , hugged you tight , watched you succeed , saw you fail , cheered you on and kept you strong , copy and paste this to your status . I've even added a pic of my sister and I . :) 
\Missing someone isn't about how long it's been since you've seen them last or the amount of time since you talked . It's aboutthat very moment when you're doing something and you wish that they were right there with you . \"" 
If you were a fruit , what would it be ? Why ? 
A friend is someone who understands your past , believes in your future and accepts you just the way you are . 
when one door closes ... another opens ... headed to < PROPMALE > ! 
Summer cleaning ... donated 18 full garbage bags of CLOTHES , PURSES , and SHOES from my dressers and closet ... wow ! 
I love watching thunderstorms and tornadoes ! Getting out my camcorder ;) 
Enjoy the little things , for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things . 
I took \Bob the plant\ " home from school at the end of May ... and he's still alive ... its a miracle ;) " 
Had a wonderful time in < PROPMALE > with my mom ... shopping , talking , learning how to skype , eating , and < PROPMALE > shows ! 
Tried water skiing today for the first time ! Now at the lake relaxing . 
Thinking outside the box and coloring outside the lines ! 
Thanks for the birthday wishes ! It is great to have such wonderful friends ! 
Too often we underestimate the power of a touch , a smile , a kind word , a listening ear , an honest compliment , or the smallest act of caring , all of which have the potential to turn a life around . 
While shopping this weekend in the cleaning aisle I kept seeing the words \New and Improved\ " ... wondering to myself ... How can it be new if it was improved ? " 
having a hard time falling asleep ... 
\Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter . \ " \ 
So glad this week is over . Looking forward to February ! 
Just because it comes in your size ... 
Hugs can do great amounts of good - especially for children . \
