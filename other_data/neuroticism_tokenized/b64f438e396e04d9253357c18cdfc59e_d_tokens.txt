Coming to the conclusion that I'm not much of a \ Mr. Mom . \"" 

Anyone have an oversized hamster tube/watering device ? I'm thinking it could be a real timesaver since my kids have asked for about thirty drinks in the last few hours . 
Anyone know what the going rate is for an Ace bandage from an emergency room visit ? Just curious . Thanks kids , for sparking my curiosity . 
I came home today and it appeared as though my wife was a fully functional woman . She was pleasant and energetic so I thought the first trimester funk might be over . We celebrated by going to dinner ... maybe dinner wasn't the best idea . The first trimester funk is apparently back . 
My boys all have hankerchiefs that they wear as capes pretty reguarly . My youngest requested that we take off his cape so he can poop . My oldest , matter of factly , let us know that he takes his cape off as well to go poop . It really makes me wonder if being a superhero is really all it's cracked up to be . 
Thank you to all who have served or are serving in our military . You are the stiff spine that makes tyranny and oppression think twice about stepping on our front porch . I hope everyone can take some time today to think about the people that are willing to give and have given their lives to protect this great ideal of freedom that we all enjoy everyday . 
I'm thinking about donating the last strip of yard that hasn't been mowed to the National Park service . Maybe they can use it as a fieldmouse refuge or something .
