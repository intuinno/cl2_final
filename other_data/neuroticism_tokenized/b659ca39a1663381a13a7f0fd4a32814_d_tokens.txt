O , we're half way there ! O-o we're livin ' on a prayer ! Take my hand , we'll make it I swear ! ( Still loving the 80's . Prepping for my overnight . ) 
and so castles made of sand fall in the sea , eventually . ( There's just something magical about Jimi Hendrix . ) 
let me show you baby , I'm a talented boy . ( < PROPMALE > . Don't care , his music makes me feel pretty . )

Well , contrary to what you seem to believe , no one cares what you are listening to . Nor would we like to be subjected to it the whole 45mins of our bus ride . Nor does causing yourself to go deaf make you look cool . 
there is literally nothing better than taking off cold wet clothes to slip into just-out-of-the-dryer ones . 
little town , it's a quiet village . Every day , like the one before . Little town , full of little people , waking up to say ... ( Oh , you know you want to ... =D )

I'm breathing in this silence like never before . Oh maybe , maybe , maybe I can share it with you . I'll behave , I'll behave , I'll behave so I can share it with you . I can change , I can change , I can change but who do you want me to be ? I'm the same , I'm the same , I'm the same , do you want me to be ? You are not alone , dear loneliness . You forgot , but I remember this .

sometimes it's hard to practice what you preach . But it's doable . 
wow . Yoga kicked my ass . Go fig . 
All of that wasn't for him . It was for you . There is nothing for you to rescue , and nothing for you to restore . If he wants to heal , he'll do it on his own . That black hole of his will be his undoing if he doesn't see it , but it's not your job to fill it and it's not your job to open his eyes . Bottom line : do your own time . Being you is hard enough without the added pressure of carrying his weight to the finish line . 
wanna do my spanish homework ? =D 
oh , who ever shall I cheer for this Superbowl ?

-Hey , guess what ? It's Champagne Thursday ! -It's Friday . -Uh , yeah , Thursday came twice this week . -Hm ... for the third straight week . -There's talk of making it permanent . Like daylight savings time , but for booze ! 
I don't want to be that girl who laughs the loudest , or the girl who never wants to be alone . I don't want to be that call at 4 o'clock in the morning , cuz I'm the only one in the world who will be home ... I don't want to be the girl that has to fill the silence . If I let myself go , I'm the only one to blame . 
I'll save all the green M&M's for you . 
I forgot that I remember this . 
Dear Crazy-Asian Lady , Thank you for a bus full of laughs . I adored your caked on makeup , and urine smell . I'll never forget how you turned and yelled at the poor man who got on the bus , and accidentally touched your arm . Or how you groped that young college student into submission . I'll always remember the time we shared . I only wish we could meet again , but alas , it can never be . xoxo < PROPFEMALE >
