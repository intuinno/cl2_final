If you think it's okay to judge me just because I decided to grow up faster than you did then by all means I should be able to judge you for thinking you're so much better than me because you get high and drunk every night . I don't have to < PROPMALE > satisfaction and happiness anymore , so where does that leave you ? 
False labor pains = no joke . Kinda scared to know what the real thing feels like now .. 
I would have a show like Oprah , that I would be the host of . Everyday Christmas , give < PROPFIRST > your wish list .

Thank you for the birthday wishes everyone , I had a great 22nd birthday . <3 :) 
i can't believe zach is going to be a month old in two days . time really does fly , no joke . <3 
you think you can't possibly love your son any more than you already do .. then he reaches up , grabs your face , looks into your eyes and smiles -- and your heart just about explodes <3 
And I do believe it’s true , that there are roads left in both of our shoes but if the silence takes you then I hope it takes me too . <3
