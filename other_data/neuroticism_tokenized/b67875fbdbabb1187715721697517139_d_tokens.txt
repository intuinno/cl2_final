\look ! there's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual ! \ " lol " 
I think I must go to sleep perhaps maybe it's quite a possibility at this point in time in my life , and maybe a probable thing that will happen later at a sooner time that I would like to choose but maybe sorta probably don't have a prayer of doing so at this point in my life of wanting to choose things I don't want and getting things I do .... in other words , goodnight 
starting class tomorrow .... woo ... hoo
