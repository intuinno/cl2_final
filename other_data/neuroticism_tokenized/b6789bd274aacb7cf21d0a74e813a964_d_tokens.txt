Lawn Tractor Care 101 .. Much like your car , your Lawn tractor requires oil to run properly . Also like your car , it needs to be checked periodically . NOTE .. Large quantities of black smoke might indicate that you have failed to do this . Anybody know where I can rent a goat ? 
Economics 101 . Timely investments in tractor motor oil is cheaper than a new engine . 
So .. when a lawn tractor regergitates oil and gas .. that's SERIOUSLY BAD .. am I right ?

A step in the right direction -> Police officials have put Fike on temporary administrative leave as the department’s Internal Affairs unit investigates the incident . The dog shooting , which received national media coverage , took place on 18th Street , N.W. , with hundreds of festival goers standing nearby and dozens watching in horror as the incident unfolded .

We go way back . Lucky can come home tomorrow at 11am . $$$ , but worth it :}
