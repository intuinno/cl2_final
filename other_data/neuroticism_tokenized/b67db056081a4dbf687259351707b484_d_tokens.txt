Snow has ruined my weekend ... there will be lots of food consumption and weeping ... 
Next week is spring break ! I'm super excited ! :) 
I guess it wouldn't be spring break if we didn't get snow 
My mom bought me a fold-up table so I can work on my laptop while in bed . My cat thinks it's her special perch and consequently most of my assignments end with ... plkojmhnbijhnbhgvb . 
I love getting my haircut , it makes me feel refreshed ! 
The vet has informed me that my cat is cancer free , at least from what she can tell , however Marbles has Arthritis . Between the two though I'm glad it's just Arthritis ! 
Blisters + Dancing = really bad idea ! 
The Blue October concert Saturday was the bomb !!! 
For those of you who do not already know this , I'm transferring to Front Range Community Program to certify as an American Sign Language Interpreter . I'm totally excited ! :) 
Flogging < PROPFEMALE > concert was amazing ! Even more amazing was the card checker didn't notice I was under 21 . If I lived a different lifestyle last night would have been a really really good night :)

I love rain ! It makes me very happy :) 
I had a dream the other night that I had a pet duck and we lived in a castle . It really didn't make any sense , but the duck was cute :)
