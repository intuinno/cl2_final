Windrock this weekend anyone ? 

Windrock is AWESOME this year . 
BP is paying ridiculous amounts of money to cleanup workers . If you're not a doctor or lawyer I HIGHLY recommend that you get in on a crew for a couple days a week . 25,000 people and 8,000 boats and counting . There's TONS of jobs . 
Professional road cycling blows right now . It's the most dishonorable , unsportsmanlike display of pretentious bullshit I've ever witnessed ( apart from every triathelete I've ever met ( of course )) . Their version of sportsmanship is some random bullshit niceity . Sportmanship isn't about subtleties . It's about an uncontrolable love for your sport that results in outrageous heroicism . 
Incredibly psyched to be going to Snowshoe with a good crew . 
100% sold on the Leatt Brace now . It is just as essential for DH as a helmet . 
Really scared and alone right now . My world is falling apart . 
Sad . 
Broke my femur . Didn't stop me from getting 2 more runs in though . 
Go Gamecocks 
I love you momma . I won't ever forget you . 
Yeahhhhhh Gwin . Go USA . I've been waiting for this moment for years . 
Is it ever going to stop snowing ? 
More Gwinning tomorrow ? I think yes . 
GWINNING !!!!!! Go < PROPFEMALE > . 
Holy Toledo !!!!! < PROPMALE > HART PUT 11 SECONDS ON THE REST OF THE FIELD IN THE POURING RAIN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
11.69 Seconds ? Really ? Really ? 
Go Cards 
Can't help but notice that none of the mainstream media is making an effort to cover the massive protests on Wall Street . Hmmm ? 
National Championships was AWESOME !!!!!! Anyone that missed it missed some legendary racing and some even more legendary parties . Come out next year . Now i need to eat and hydrate .
