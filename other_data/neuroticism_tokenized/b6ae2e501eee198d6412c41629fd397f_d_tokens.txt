sometimes things get weird in my head 
I need scripts ! 
I have so much to say it would take me days to get it all out . All this time so many emotions conflicting but it seems anger is winning now . Sleep is not a given . Mental peace is a luxury . A full , empty stomach is a contradiction . Contradiction is my reality . 
i give up . i've been lying in bed awake long enough i might as well do something

Does anyone remember < PROPMALE > Wehadababyitsaboy 
Intelligence is a burden . Ignorance is bliss . 
First dentist , then school board , then audition

I've been writing for hours . My hands ache and they're shaking . I hope this works . 
Got some halfway decent rest . Now i just wish my heart would stop pounding so hard in my chest . 
Guess who has an appetite today ! I'm starting to really feel better .

Fake ass motherfuckers are cancerous tumors and are deserving only of being excised and irradiated .
