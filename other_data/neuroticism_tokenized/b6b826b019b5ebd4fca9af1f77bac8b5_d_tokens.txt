My daughter Sami has 2 Guinness World records now at age 13 that's pretty impressive ! 

In memory of my mom who lost her battle with breast cancer 10 years ago today . And to all of the grandmas , moms , sisters , and friends that are battling cancer my heart and prayers go out to you . We need to find a cure ! 
Happy Thanksgiving to everyone !!!! Stay warm and safe !!!

Wow 53 degrees out ! Starting to feel balmy out !!! It's so nice to see leaf buds on the trees and the crocus ' opening up !!! Momma deer has her two juveniles still with her , saw her in the neighbors yard yesterday ! Heard my yard owl around 3am the other night when I couldn't sleep . 
Sure wish I could figure out which tree he is in . Just too many trees and too dense to find him !!! When the big red headed woodpecker shows up , and the nesting pair of mtn chickadees with their double striped caps ... then I know for sure it's springtime !!!!
