Ahh , my first day of a much needed week-long vacation . I've also decided that my new year's resolution is going to involve changing my overall mood and outlook on life in some positive way . I haven't quite fleshed it out , yet . 

Ya know , I think I actually would like this over Twitter . Yeah . Yeah , it's better . 
Got my picture up FINALLY . I know , I don't talk much . I'm a bit antisocial-networking . XD Gonna try to work on that . 
Well , spent Thanksgiving at the Hospital with Ally and my mother-in-law . It was more fun than it sounds , though . I hope you all had a happy one ! All celebratin ' what < PROPFEMALE > thankful for and what-not . 
Snow , snow , go away . Come back on a later date when I'm not working and can enjoy you . Please ! -- Stupid snow never listens to me . 
2011 , here we come ! \ 
Happy New Year , and may all your resolutions come to fruition ! 
Yay . Snow . Here's hoping I don't get stuck at work ! 
Big congrats to the Saints ! 
Oh , and Happy V-Day and Chinese New Year to all ! 
My job security is currently on shaky grounds , so I'm sending out feelers for any opportunities out there . If you know of any prime job openings in the area , preferrably in the office/clerical or graphic design fields , I would greatly appreciate sending them my way ! Thanks ! 
Going to bed . Got a lot accomplished last night , and plan to do even more tonight . World , watch out ! 
Decided it's time to make a change in our lives . Official decrease in food consumption and increase in healthy activity will now commence ! Just basic exercise and calorie counting for now ; will worry about more details later . 
Wishes Google Chrome had NoScript - best plugin of Firefox , hands down . 
Special K Bars -> the BEST 90 calorie snacks in existence . No contest . 
My hovercraft is full of eels . 
Whew ! Just spent about 5 hours making a presentation for my Biology class . Glad that's over with ! I mean , I did enjoy it , but boy am I spent . Now , back to work . :P 
So , we had someone quit today at the Super 8 in Clemmons . If anyone knows a good , dependable person who needs some extra cash , we have an opening for 2 days a week , most likely every other week . It's Saturday/Sunday morning shift ( 7am-3pm ) . 
What is more important :\ 
1 . ( A ) Anonymity or ( B ) Accountability ? \ 
2 . ( A ) Safety or ( B ) Freedom ? \ 
3 . ( A ) Success or ( B ) Happiness ? \ 
\ 
I wish I lived in a world where we all chose ( B ) , but I think most of us are a bunch of ( A)'s . 
Gogo transhumanism ! http://tinyurl.com/3xzrzbr 
Thank you all for the birthday wishes ! It was fun , except for the having to work part . :( 
I finally got caught up on every episode of True Blood . I gotta say , that is one of the best TV series of all time , no doubts . Know of a better one ? Post it ! 
For a class project , and perhaps a little curiosity on my part , I have a question for all you Stedings out there :\ 
What can you remember about my personality when I was young ? You can reply with a short story , a brief memory , or just a good one-word description of the \little tyke\ " me you all remember . Nothing too embarrassing ! ;) \ 
Happy birthday < PROPFIRST > Sagan . 
Extremely depressing news today - < PROPFIRST > Nielsen is dead at the age of 84 . Good night , sweet < PROPMALE > of comedy . 
Happy , happy ! Joy , joy !
