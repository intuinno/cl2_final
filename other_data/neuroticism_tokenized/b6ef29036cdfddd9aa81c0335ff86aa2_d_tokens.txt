Its not about physical appearance , its about how good you can make it look with your spirit . 
OOOOHHHH MMYYYY GGGOOODDD !!! I think I figured it out !!! 
Casting your cares on God : I didnt know sacrificing could feel so good . 
I , once again , think Im on to something ... 
Permission to go in through the gates of the Unknown is in realizing that you have been inside all along . 
I hav a belief that if u dnt undrstnd , its cuz i dnt undrstand how u undrstnd , therefor I dnt try to explain anything .. 
OMGGGG !!! the clouds of probability that orbit around atoms are full spirits ?!?! 
I may be at peace with myself , but it , by no means , means that I am at peace with God , my sinful soul still struggles to avoid His presence . 
The Meaning of Life : I have it cornered ( Love the Lord your God with all your ... )

Hell is full of people who would rather commit suicide than live/Heaven is full of people who would rather go to hell than die . 
this morning I wondered if video games could lead people to commit suicide ... I googled ... I found ... http://videogames.lovetoknow.com/wiki/Video_Game_Related_Deaths 
Hell is full of people who would rather commit suicide than live , Heaven is full of people who would rather go to hell than die . 
The Kingdom of Heaven is among us , every Joy is at our reach

mood swings = fun time 
my sinful heart burns with fear and hate as I think about you , no wonder < PROPMALE > thought you were to bring death upon them 
if only , if only ; if only there was such and such , then I would find another reason to be unsatisfied . Salvation is now . 
worst than not knowing , is not knowing that you are not knowing

Pouring myself a mug of kool-aid , I poured slowly and reflected : if time was slower , water would be syrup ... and aiR WOULD BE PLASMA !! solid .. would stay solid , oR MAYBE NOT !! 
Weakness of the human mind is that which causes mankind to be in oblivion about Reality unless the message is communicated through logic . Strength is knowing to understand Reality through itself , the essence of the self , the Spirit 
God's mercy is powerful enough to bring people out of hell , but sinners would rather gnash their teeth than know the Truth 
The road to Enlightenment may be hard to find , but it's the only road to find 
The existence of God is not proved by what you see , but by the fact that you see ... not by what there is , but by the simple idea of Being 
Our culture tends to despise sadness and pain , unless it's comes nicely packaged ... in a soap opera

The challenge that people die for is to have what they love , but the challenge the humanity is meant to LIVE for is to Love what they have . 
Once in an eternity angels will fall . Once in a < PROPFEMALE > God will die . \ 
This unique spectacle , mankind through it all ; when what is not , claims an eternal prize . 
We get so caught up in looking for gold on the ground \ 
that we do not realize that it falls from the sky . \ 
Sometimes we even stop looking for gold , \ 
but we keep looking down , wishing it was there .

I would rather believe your lies than betray your trust . 
I would rather let you lead me to my death than disobey 
Asker : What is a question ? \ 
Answerer : umm , well , This is an Answer ! 
How do you attain something that disappears when sought ? 
hellBlessed 
For this I pray to let it be , and to fall in Love with All I see . \ 
To quiet my attempts to kill elements , and rest in peace with them instead . 
In order to actualize dreams , one must first wake up from their sleep . \

-If I had never heard this phrase before , I would have came up with it today but possibly disregarded it . 
Living in stories of mundane poetry 
People hide their private lives , \ 
So well , even from themselves , \ 
Ashamed of what others may detect . \ 
In it the God of < PROPFEMALE > lies , \ 
The Truth above all else , \ 
Afraid of the power it may project . 
So well , even from themselves , \

Absolutely Everything about the universe is written in every pixel of Reality , this is the Name of God 
I do not pray for a long life , nor riches , nor for my enemies to be destroyed , I do not even pray for wisdom ... All I pray , is that Your will is done . 
Can't get any worse than hell ... 
I doubt my own existence before I doubt God's;\ 
how can there be without The Essence of Being ? 
In the midst of my agony\ 
I get a glimpse of a memory from beyond . \ 
It reminds me , for a moment , \ 
that my pain is only an act . \ 
Out of curiosity , I choose let the memory go . \ 
It flees , and I return to my agony , \ 
as if it was real , as if this was God , \ 
with no way out . 
Reality is only as real as your imagination allows 
The maginificence of a newborn's purity lies in that they do not yet know that they are not in heaven 
we live in dark times ... not because of the things that people do , but because of the hate that people have towards the things that are done . 
when the blind lead the blind , they usually dont get anywhere 
is rolling around in ethereal mud 
My suffering is a self-imposed punishment , automatic traps I have left behind as I fell from grace to remind me that something is not right , to remind me that there is something I have not conquered . 
A person's identity is not based on the deeds , neither the experiences , nor the memories , but on the dream that outlines their present spirit , the shape of their universe that fuels their soul . 
To understand something , does not necessarily mean being able to articulate it . 
When one is blind , it does not matter how much beauty they receive , they will always be prey to repugnance . 
You are so susceptible to gossip ; my curiosity forced me to experiment with your prejudice , in order to rid my pride . 
sticks and stones may break the bones , but words will hurt the spirit 
You can't stop trying by trying to stop . 
5 y/o niece to 4 y/o niece : mom doesnt like you cuz ur white\ 
4 y/o niece : what , u think I cant kill myself ? \

mankind : fallen gods or exalted apes ? 
Believe ! Believe , for a moment believe ;\ 
and behold how REAL a lie can feel . 
Behind the walls of flat facts and insipid science there is a world :\ 
more solid than what physics can exemplify , \ 
more life than what biology can unveil , \ 
with more dimensions than what geometry can disclose , \ 
and with more truth than what logic can derive . 
Just because you agree with me does not mean that we are right , \ 
and just because we disagree with them , does not mean that they are wrong . 
Just because it makes sense to you does not mean it is true , \ 
just because it does not make sense to anybody , does not mean it is false . 
22 years ago , a soul was taken from the eternal sleep , and was bound into this my body of sin 
thank to everyone for flushing out my bage with pday wishes 
Spanish Lesson of the Day : \ 
to bother = molestar 
Explaining why I shouldn't explain ... a failure in my part . 
He who allowed me to find the words , \ 
said that if I kept quiet , I would be permitted more . 
going into PANIC MODE !!! ( mostly just for fun ) 
when you get tired of rejecting all the pain , \ 
you will accept it as the only form of pleasure you will certainly always have 
Coincidences ... coincidences ... sincere coincidences . \ 
What the hell is going on ? What do they mean ?

Things that used to confuse me , they make sense to me now ; I wonder if this is just an illusion . 
Feeling like I felt when these memories were created , nothing new . \ 
This is the culmination of addiction : it does not matter how far I try to fly , \ 
I always find myself back where I began . There must be a way out . \ 
There must be a way to cross the horizon . 
Don't try to make sense of it ;\ 
just keep listening , and the sense will be naturally inherited . 
once you get all you can ever want , you'll end up wanting something else . 
\Fall down seven times 
Like a kid in a recreational drug store 
I'm too perverted for girls , \

Battling binds : all it takes is a twitch of an eye . \ 
It's hard to remember how easy it is . 
Dreaming of the waking world ;\ 
but why do I prefer to keep dreaming\ 
instead of waking up ? 
do you ever feel tired of being alive ? \ 
couple times a day , about 4-6 days a week . 
In the blink of an eye , \ 
in a fleeting moment of subtle decision , I feel powerful again . \ 
A feeling I have not felt in years , and am probably not ready to dwell in . \ 
it only lasts 2 seconds before I feel powerfully pathetic , then dead again . 
Be free , but do not be enslaved by it . 
Happy ... to , be ... alive ...??? \

Knowledge is a state of mind

Growing up means ;\ 
scolding children because you are jealous of the freedom they have\ 
and that you were forced to give up . 
Life is serious , < PROPMALE > is gay . \ 
-Schiller 
I don't feel so good , \ 
my immediate future aches . \ 
:( 
To grow old , means to dictate what is right and what is wrong , \ 
regardless of the actuality . \ 
The most tragic part of it is that\ 
children are growing up at younger and younger ages . 
I felt how I left my ambitions behind the wall in another realm , \ 
I realized that my mind and body does not constitute life , \ 
I felt an expanse around me and realized : \ 
All these years I have been living inside my head , \ 
I have been dreaming all along , \ 
I have been asleep for so long .
