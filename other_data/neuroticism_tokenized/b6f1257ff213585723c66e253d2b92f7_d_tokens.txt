waiting for my cousin to get her butt back from her shopping adventure . Can you say boredom ? 

oh , no . just noticed now that I have this she can read it and see how my life basically revolves around her . poop . 
I was just listening to the radio and a song came on ... After a while I went ' This guys voice sounds like < PROPMALE > Bellamy ' and a minute later I heard these lyrics in it that I thought I remembered . And it WAS Muse .... I feel smart . { For all you people who do not understand ... < PROPMALE > Bellamy is the singert of Muse . } 
Everybodyu better be celebrating my cousins birthday today ! She's mah SISTAH !!! 
Peoplez I am seriously still looking for a band . If you know anyone who is a drummer/bassist/singer I could really use them !!! :] thanks 
I love you < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > !!! He was the BEST one on that darn American Idol ! 
I've been on here for two hours . I have no life . 
Wondering wether I except a request from my lovely cousin's BESTEST buddie Alon ... From what I've heard ... It would not be wise ... 
Happy for < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > ! What a lovely relationship you shall have :] Congrats from the one who set you up lol 
People should really stop writing the word ' lemon ' because some crazies like me look at it as ' Lennon ' and begin to freak out thinking it's of the < PROPFIRST > sorts only to realize they've just spazzed for no reason at all and failed miserably . 
Looks as if my Grandma { Who now has a facebook } cut my wonderful cousin out of a picture and it's just me ... Sorry wonderful sistah ' o mine . 
Father says I've got to move on to someone new and younger instead of < PROPFIRST > Roberts . Haha who shall it be ..? 
Apparently I am more of an Aquarius , Pisces , Cancer and < PROPFIRST > . I don't get it . I'm too creativer for like three signs so I wasn't like them , but apparently I'm not creative enough to be a total Pisces and I still got it ..? 
< PROPFEMALE > , delaney , < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > seriously why are you friends with < PROPMALE > on here ? that shows a lack of support . 
Just saw that < PROPFIRST > got a facebook ... I'm quiet happy about this . For those of you who don't know who he is ... He was my ' boyfriend ' or whatever you'd call that kind of thing in fifth grade ... Haha ! I missed him ! 
Saw < PROPFIRST > talk yesterday . You could of probably guessed I had a spazz attack and about crapped my pants . 
Happy birthday < PROPMALE > ! We all love you ! 
Ticked off because < PROPFIRST > Roberts is hurt and now stupid < PROPMALE > Wigginton is playing second ... That's just a bad call . At least put Andino on second if it can't be < PROPFIRST > . 
Say ' I ' if you think the Yankees are STUPID as DIRT ! 
Seriously just became a fan of < PROPMALE > Higgenson's nose , and you know what ? It's THE BEST NOSE EVER !!!!

Hey , JoBros ... You're not a band ! You're 3/4 of a band . What real , talented band needs a back up band when they play live ??? 
Vegetarian and proud of it . I hate when people tell me that it's stupid , wrong and unhealthy to not eat meat . I just believe that animals deserve rights . And if you'd actually do research and open your eyes and stop being so ignorant you'd realize that being a vegetarian is actually the smartest decision for you and the animals . Fact . 
total truth : if you want to know more about me look at my Flair . Lol there's my life in little buttons . 
Got a new sound and my love and passion for music is back ! The guitar sounds amazing ... Not so sure about my voice though haha :D

You were wild and crazy , just so frustrating , intoxicating , complicated ... Got away by some mistake and now I miss ... Screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain . Two a.m. and I'm cursing your name ! So in love that you acted insane ! And that's the way I loved you .... \ 
- < PROPFIRST > Swift\ 
Is that good enough now < PROPFIRST > ? 
One more sad song . Tears shed . She's gone . She'd take it back if she only could ... And all the perfect words they seem so wrong ! She's gone ... Last day . She cries . Whispers \goodbye\ " . She walks once more out that door . And all the perfect words they seem so wrong ... Please stay ! Don't go away ! The hardest thing is letting go of you ... What can I do ?... I cannot breathe ... " 
It takes half the time that you were with a person to get over them ... Waiting for February 24th to come as if when I hit that day everything will be forgotten ... But I know it won't . 
R.I.P. < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Lennon ... 30 years ... \

Phone's not working and I haven't talked to Vino in three days :( \ 
And then when he says he'll call he doesn't >:( <--- more sad than angry , but that face works .

Wishing people would stop saying they love people who they've only been dating for maybe a month ..
