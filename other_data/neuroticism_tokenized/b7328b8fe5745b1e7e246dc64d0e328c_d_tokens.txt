Opening week we have project X which is a competition between 64 teams made up of the freshman class who makes a cover for a remote control car that carries around things to get past an obstacle course . we have to make a bridge , a net to catch a rubber duck , and some way of carrying the duck to the finish line and driving skills are important too .
