Amazing day ! Laser Tag , Noodles , sanwiches , and a guy dressed up like spiderman ! Now if only we knew where those random boxers came from .... hmmm .... 
What ? Since when did Mrs. Bahr not put quizzes on her website ? I need those ! 
Who loves orange soda ? 
I feel like I have to say something .... but I have nothing to say ... so this status right here is pointless .

I'm having a battle with music theory right now , and it's kicking my butt . 
Bleh ... 
< PROPFEMALE > Pitts is the ultimate klutz BAHAHAHAHA !!!! 
Repost this if someone you knew was killed by Lord Voldemort . As everyone knows , being killed by Avada Kedavra , having your soul sucked out by a dementor or getting petrified by a basilisk is a truly tragic fate for anyone , muggle or wizard . 93% of people won’t repost this . Will you spread awareness of this growing threat ?
