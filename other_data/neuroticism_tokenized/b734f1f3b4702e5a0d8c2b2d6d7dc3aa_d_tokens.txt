Summer is great , except for the fact that it makes you all hot and sitcky . Blah . Stupid humidity 
WE LOST POWER !! :D 
Sushi + last dance classes for the summer = OK day 
IEWWCK ! I HATE THE DENTIST'S OFFICE !! :( 
All these updates to FB are weird ... cant they just keep it the way that it was ?? 
Just rode a little bike wearing and rincess hat , sunflower glasses and bright pink lipstick . ( Keelin Markou ) 
Fall ! Like leaves in the winter !! ( Keelin Markou ) 
IPOD IPOD !! IPOD !!! IPOD !! :D 
When it comes to editing pictures , covering the picture in BIG , BOLD words doesnt make it photography or make it \pretty \"/\" prettier\ " . It just makes the picture look like a jumbled mess of blah . " 
...... I hate my vivid imagination ........... 
IT'S SOOO HOT !!! Kinda like it ... :) 
I feel like a college kid ( Keelin Markou ) 
3rd one in a row . Wow , I cant believe we pulled it off . 11 hours of sleep in 3 days :) ( Keelin Markou ) 
Since when was I an expert with computers/internet ? I just fixed our computer !! :D .. Maybe I'll get ungrounded ... :) 
My mom has the AC on so high that I need to wear a sweater and have a blanket wrapped around me !! Why can't we just open the windows .. warmth is good :) 
( I'm taking this from Keelin Markou ) Prcurorable : Pretty , cute , and adorable . 
That's the thing about a mirror , it shows you all your flaws , but when in reality , you might not have any . And even if you do , they are not as big as the mirror makes them to be . 
Antanëyel mel ... antanëlyen man ? 
has 5 pounds of yummilicious blueberries to eat :D 
doesnt know exactly what to put as her FB status .. 
I'm not gonna sleep until I know you're ok ... 
Ok , for all the people out there who think the Earth belongs to humans , you are sorely mistaken . Last time I checked , animals were here way before us , so what are we doing destroying their habitats ? The animals are NOT invading our backyards , we are invading theirs . If we keep encroaching on their habitat , Earth's natural beauty will be lost , and will just be a urban wasteland . STOP KILLING WILDLIFE ! WHO'S WITH ME ?!? 
Just used the lawnmower for the first time !! I feel very accomplished ... :) 
says to the sky : Stop thundering and just rain already !!! 
Why does your stupid status have to be a maximum of 420 characters !??! The good stuff is always longer than \420 stupid characters \"" 
You are not best friends with a person until you have nearly killed them :P ( Keelin Markou ) 
i HATE those little mosquitos 
STOP dying !!! .. wait .. keep dying for ONE more second ! ( Keelin Markou )

Why do I want lemon water ????? 
I'm strong on the surface .... not all the way through ...... 
So much for the football game :P ( < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > ) 
Some people live in a house on a hill . And wish they were someplace else . There's nobody there . When the evening is still . Secrets , with no one to tell . Some I have known , have a ship where they sleep . With the sounds of rocks on the coast . They sail over oceans . Five fathoms deep . But they cant find what they want the most ... 
Oh my goodness . I am actually in high school 
Smells like rain ..... 
First dance classes tomorrow :) 
I've lied to you in the past ... I probably will lie to you in the future ... and I just want to say I'm sorry . 
just finished making a new photo wall in her room 
What if ... 
I'll put on another smile for you tomorrow . I do it everyday , so tomorrow shouldnt be any different ....... right ? 
Good news and bad news . Good news : < PROPFIRST > found Spicy Noodles at Meijer , I've been looking for them for years . Bad news : Dad's gotta sell the house ... 
What if I told you that living on the edge wasnt enough for me ? What if I told you that I had to be falling off the edge in order to feel alive ? 
Off to Dad's for the weekend .. 
Everything that's standing still is moving . 
Just got my hair cut :) 
Happy 1st Day of Autumn ! 
... couldnt wait to get going ... but wasnt quite ready to leave .. 
Clickety clack , clickety clack .... you cant get off and you'll never go back ..... 
All I am ... a child with promises .... all I have .... are < PROPMALE > full of promises of home . 
No . You guys can't be like two peas in a pod because she's already a pea in MY pod !!! ( Keelin Athená Markoupolou , < PROPFIRST > Fernandez ) 
There was a blank space next to my name , so I thought I needed a status . 
Say nothing . Do nothing . Be nothing . 
Well . Dance was interesting . I found out I have uneven shoulder blades , AND I did 3 double pirouettes !!! 
I just had a chocolate fight :) ( Keelin Athená Markoupolou ) 
I am not about to tell you what is on my mind ... 
Just ate a sandwich and a bowl of chocolate/peanut butter cereal ..... hmmm 
Does it really matter how we die ? I mean ... we're all gonna die anyway . So does it really matter how ? 
Well . I'm grounded so I figured I might as well get on Facebook :P 
It's hard . Knowing you're dying and knowing that there is nothing I can do to stop it . 
I love how everything I do seems wrong to you .. 
Oh my goodness . This social studies paper sucks . 
Off to Wisconsin . See everyone Sunday ... 
Sometimes just standing in the rain gives you the best feeling ever .. 
Keelin Athená Markoupolou : ... I thought we were sharing ..... 
I think I need a status ... so .. this is my status .. 
Hey ! Anybody who has Mrs. Cone's World History class .... what's the homework ?? 
Ugh . I just realized I still have homework .. 
Just played an interesting game of Twister :) 
I love how one moment my eyes can be glistening with tears , and the next my lips are aching from smiling so hard .. 
Your words are swimming circles around my brain ... 
Today was a good day :) Or at least is has been so far ... 
Keelin Athená Markoupolou : I'm bubbling with oobers of googly joy !!! 
.. Homework time .. 
I wish I had a trap door somewhere in my house that only I knew about ... And maybe that trap door would lead me into my own secret world ... Where eveything was exactly the way I needed it . 
Can I tell you a story ?... As we dance while the sun starts to bleed .... 
Stuffing = Stuff you stuff in stuff :) ( Keelin Athená Markoupolou ) 
I'm screaming .. it's funny though .. because no one hears me . Hm . Now what's wrong with that ? 
All I remember is the silence of the dead\ 
The ringing in my ears\ 
The pounding in my head\ 
All I remember is the silence\ 
The silence nobody else can hear 
( < PROPFEMALE > Love-me Smith ) Guess who got 9 fouettes in a row ? That's right !! ME !!! :D 
I see only black and white , for there is no color here 
So ... shaking like a chihuahua is always fun ... 
I want to stand in the rain with my arms raised high and the clouds tears running through my hair ... the thunder shaking the earth and the lightning turning night to day ... 
Well ... my mood just got CRUSHED 
Just got 12 hours of sleep ... at a sleepover with Keelin Athená Markoupolou ... that's a first .. 
Off to Dad's for 3 days .... BYE EVERYBODY !! 
Can I give you my eyes so you can see me the way I do ? Will you keep them ? Because I dont want them back . I want eyes that work , and mine seem to be broken . 
Finals begin tomorrow . Fun , fun , fun 
: You're a hat . \ 
Keelin Markou : A what ?! \ 
Me : A human cat\ 
Keelin : Oooh . Why not a cauman ? 
I'm so badass . I hit your pineapple . \ 
( Keelin Markou , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > Love-me Smith ) 
My whole body hurts ... stupid dance :P 
I'm from the wicked giggle puddle :) \ 
< PROPFEMALE > Bernhardt 
I'm gonna be in so much pain tomorrow .... I have problems walking now .. \ 
I don't like ballet .. well .. at least the pain it causes me . 
She's swears there're no difference ... between the lies and compliments .. 
Cant decide on a profile picture ... 
Oh my gosh . Today is National Brownie Day !! :D 
Me : OMG !! IS THAT A MONSTER !!?!?! \ 
Keelin : No ... Emily .. that would be a truck .... 
Red eyeliner = fantastic 
Cross your fingers .. hope for a snow day .

Woke up about an hour ago .

It's not inside out ..... it's outside in .. 
Was supossed to go to sleep about 2 hours ago ... but she cant sleep ... 
My ankles were making funny faces at me , so I made some faces back . ( Keelin Markou ) 
I closed his eyes .. so he just looks like he's sleeping . 
How can you look at me ... when I can't stand myself ..? 
Cross your fingers\ 
Cross your toes\ 
Let's all hope\ 
For more , more snow :P 
My hippagladus hurts because I talked too much .. 
Hold my heart until it stops beating .. 
Oww .... headache ... 
Being home sick sucks ... there's nothing to do :P 
Snow day conversation-\ 
\ 
Me : Ok , let's go through the snowday rituals , put potato by everyones alarm clock , wear your-\ 
Mom : You are not putting a potato by my alarm clock . Have some common sense and check the weather report . \ 
Me : The weather report doesnt mean crap , it's all about BELIEVING ! 
I will not stop until I get this flexibility thing . \ 
I will not stop until I get the turns . \ 
I will not stop . \ 
I will not stop . 
I can fool anyone with my sweet , sweet smile ... 
....... Just paranoid of getting lost or that I might lose .. 
Off to ballet for an hour and forty minutes . Fun fun . 
Today was actually a good dance day . I didnt screw anything up :) 
Two hours later and I'm still not finished with the rough draft of my English paper ... I should have planned this out better :P 
Peanut butter-banana-caramel sandwich =<3 
How was my day ? Well , the world smacked me in the face . 
Homework . Sucks . 
Feels obligated to have a status . \ 
So here it is . 
Dear Mother Nature , \ 
I know it's not snowing right now but ... I think it should . \ 
A half day tomorrow is great , but wouldnt it be awesome if we had a snowday ?? \ 
You're the only one who can make that happen .. and you wouldnt want to dissapoint us now would you ? \ 
Okay .. well , if you get this letter , please make it snow lots n lots . \ 
Thank you ! \ 
- < PROPFEMALE >

Hungary wants to eat the Soviet Union because it tastes like Superman ice-cream . \ 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST >

The snow has started . I repeat . The snow has started . :)

Oh well .. I got to fall on my head , do some weird weight sharing AND I got to run around in my underwear !! Keelin Markou < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Love-me Smith 
Just woke up from a nap , thought it was 7:40 in the morning , freaked out , started getting ready for school , then I realized , it was still Thursday . 
Not having a camera really halts my creativity process ..... :( 
I hate weekends like this . Everything exciting happens when I'm gone . Oh well .
