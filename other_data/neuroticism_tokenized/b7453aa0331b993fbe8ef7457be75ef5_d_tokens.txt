It's Sister week !! If you have a sister who has made you laugh , wiped your tears , hugged you tight , watched you succeed , saw you fail , cheered you on and kept you strong , copy and paste this to your status .? Sisters(related or not ) are supposed to be a promise from God that we will have a forever friend .... I ? mine !! I miss u JANICE(r . i . p) ~ I love u < PROPFEMALE > & couldn't of made it this far without u < PROPFEMALE > 
HAPPY FATHER's DAYY 2 all the real fathers out there ! And a real father isn't necessarily blood-related , but is the person who realized it was time to be a man & MAN-UP by stepping up to the plate and has been an active part in there child's life ! 
So , what do u do when so called family members seem 2b taking advantage of ur mom ? 
I'm feeling much better about life and my surroundings ! 
I really HATE when FAMILY members have so called issues with me , but WON'T address me ! -FYI ~ I chose 2 voice MY PERSONAL opinon about a situation ! My family's actions were FOUL & SAD ! Sad because there is both a GOOD & BAD fact 2 all of this ~ ~ the BAD is that I'm use 2 it ! the GOOD is that I am finally tired of it ! So 2 all the parties involved ~ ~ STOP TRIPPIN ' ON MY KID ! U know EXACTLY both how & where to find me ! 
MAMA said there would be days like this ! 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY 2 my EX-sister in law TAYA < PROPFEMALE > POWELS ~ ~ (R.I.P )
