3 observations that made me smile today 1 . I saw an elderly couple working out together n it made me want 2 grow old with someone who will workout with me the rest of our lives 2 .

So I was cleaning out some of my files and found all the tests I took for my Psych testing class in college , I found my CPI score which states that I'm an < PROPFEMALE > female and I know that I like < PROPFEMALE > males so does that mean all my relationships are doomed for failure ? Or can there be 2 alphas in a relationship ? lol

Monday Margaritas at Acapulco's with my BFF are the best :) 
So I wake up with my lips swollen and I have no clue why , I thought they would be back to normal by now but they aren't :( Weird thing is that I dreamt I was fighting some girl in my bikini and people went to watch the fight . In my dream I won but I guess she got a punch in lol 
Its a beautiful night out , you can see Mars and < PROPFEMALE > and the < PROPFEMALE > looks < PROPFEMALE > gorgeous . There's supposed to be a meteor shower tonight too :) 
Javi and I should be banned from Gyu Kaku , we've been having lunner since 3 and were 3 Sake pitchers in and I've had 2 Shochu's , so by the time I'm sober I'll be hungry again lol but we've had some good conversations ! 
In Lake Perris with the Lambdas about to get on the jet skis yay ! 
Where's my Mommy when I need her ? I get home and no one , not even my dogs are here , kind of scary . I take a nap bc every bone/muscle hurts and I wake up barely able to move n with a sore throat , ughh I need her to give me a massage n make me her famous tea with a < PROPFEMALE > shot . 
Thank you everybody for the birthday wishes , you make me feel all warm and fuzzy , I really appreciate them :) Also thanks to all my friends for making it out last night .

I'm canceling bowling tonight , I kind of want to spend today with my family so I'll see you all at Kazuyo on Fri . Peace and Love <3 !! Besos !! 
Children\ 
with special needs don't have an illness , so there is no cure and it's \ 
not contagious . They want what we all want - to be accepted . Most of you\ 
probably won't copy and paste this , but will you do it and leave it on \ 
your status for at least an hour ? It's special education week , and \ 
... this ...... is in honor of all ...... the kids who need a little extra \ 
help and understanding . 
So they're having sundaes for all the tenants in our office building ME : Let's go , they're gonna have homeade ice cream and 10 toppings plus since we've moved here I have seen no hotties n I wanna c if they exist My Coworkers : Ay Gaby ( shaking their head ) u never learn ) My Boss : R u working or shopping Me : Both , I can multi-task lol

I officially hate the DMV , my license expired on my bday but they were closed Wed , then I went on Fri , closed . Tried to make an appt , & closest appt was Sep 22 . Now I'm at the Fullerton DMV and I'm # 556 and its barely on 401 , all I can do is laugh and clean my purse . 
Not only is Miss Mexico Miss Universe but she's from the best state in Mexico , Jalisco yay !!! 
I'm leaving to Havasu tonight , < PROPFEMALE > excited !! its my 1st time . I have no idea what to pack well besides bikinis . I'm going with my lil sis so I hope I don't turn into Momma bear & just enjoy myself . I tend 2 be overprotective of my siblings lol which is kind of funny bc now I date guys her age , but I can't help it . I carried her when she was lil and taught her how to ride a bike and swim . Great ending 2 my bday month ! 
On the road to Laughlin , our first stop before Havasu , drinking 4 Lokos with < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , Steph , Chona , and < PROPMALE > , having some interesting conversations , \Don't want no\ " lol Oh n what a small world my 2 sorority sisters are joining us .

Had a great wkd in Havasu , Fri was chill , Sat we partied all day and night , it was an episode of real world at the house , too funny ! and today was our adventurous day , we went tubing , and jumped off cliffs . Good times ! 
At the Boiling Crab for my boos bday , don't like seafood , well except for shrimp , so I hope its good ! 
So I officially have a license again , I was beginning to feel like an outlaw driving with an expired license for 2 wks . It took many trips to different DMVs and a lot of waiting . I'm bummed that it has a restriction to wear glasses though , this time I didn't have enough time to memorize the chart :( oh well ! 
I was supposed 2 go 2 Vegas this wkd with < PROPFEMALE > and Jas like last yr but I couldn't bear partying 2 wkds in a row . I swear once you hit 29 you kind of want to slow down . So I'll be working , making some $ so that I can take a trip 2 < PROPFEMALE > at something . Ladies night out at Sangrias in Hermosa Beach tonight ! I can't top my Vegas Labor Day wkd 2009 trip anyways , I'll have stories for yrs . Have fun girls !! 
\All what we are is a result of what we have thought\ " Buddha " 
Working Miller promos with my BFF yay ! The day won't drag as much bc we always have fun :) 
I don't know what's wrong with me , I made Fri a blockbuster night , ran only once this wk , haven't been to the gym since Thurs , have been eating unhealthy crap , got tipsy off 2 glasses of Shiraz , and called my parents at 12:30 am bc I was worried that they weren't home yet . IDK but by Tues , I need to be back to myself again lol 
< PROPFEMALE > enough of my Grandma behavior , ran 3 < PROPMALE > and now I'm on my way to Kat's BBQ , ready to take some beer bongs , play some flip cup , and play some beer pong . I'm starting to feel more like myself again :)

I registered for Krav Maga , taking self defense with my BFF starting next week , the Rock and Roll half marathon in LA on Oct 24th , anyone want to do it with me PLEASE ???, Alum/grad wkd in Philly on the 17th < PROPFEMALE > excited and most importantly the GRE on Nov 6th , gonna be MIA bc I really got to study , especially the math part , I need a math tutor :/ Looking forward to new experiences :) 
6 Mile hike with the Palazzo roomie ughh someone kill me , I don't know why I do this to myself when I'm dehydrated lol It better be worth it Vanny !

Yesterday I got asked what I was , which I get a lot , but when I said Mexican , he's like you look Korean haha , I was like that's a first , I get Filipino a lot but not Korean and today my Mom calls me and she's like we just got out of Korean mass , she's like its the 3rd Sun we go , we're learning Korean , too funny ! 
My BFF is in Kaui without me and it feels weird to be without her bc we work out and usually have dinner together but the good thing about not going to Krav Maga with her is that the only hottie in class offered to be my partner , way hotter to try to get out of a choke with a hottie instead of the BFF :) 
Love , Love the thunder and this humid weather reminds me of summer vacations in Guadalajara :) 
No Oktoberfest for me tonight , it was too crowded , Wokanos in LB instead with Jazzy and the sweetest Filipino Boys :) 
Sunday Funday , breakfast in bed and watching \Just Wright\ " with my sis and my babies :) " 
Sunday funday continues , Mariscos and micheladas at < PROPFEMALE>'s and then pool party woop woop ! 
Did you know that the average person puts on 11 pounds during Oct 1st to < PROPFIRST > 1st ? Crazy ! Well at least people stop going to the gym , so I'll have room to breathe and no one in my bubble :) 
Celebrating my Peaches ' 26th bday at RA , aww he's all grown up nothing compared to the lil boy who wore pampers when I met him and the 16yr old who would write \I luv u\ " on my tips at the spa . <3 ya ! \ " You're such a peach ! \"" 
I wanted to go to my HIgh School homecoming game but instead chose Oktoberfest , last I heard they were winning 35 to 0 at halftime , goo Huskies ! I'll celebrate your win with a beer and doing the chix dance ! 
Anyone want to run 10 < PROPMALE > with me tomorrow ? or at least know of a good , scenic trail in the IE or OC ? I simply can't do it on the treadmill , too boring after 6 < PROPMALE > 
So I got the confirmation of my 4 day trek along the Inca trail , and I have a mix of emotions . I'm excited n scared at the same time . I'm not scared of the 93 km trail , sleeping in a tent , wild animals , or not having a normal bathroom . I'm dead scared of falling , n I guess the 2nd day is full of narrow paths and steep falls :/ I'm already having nightmares about it . I guess its a challenge I'll have to overcome . 
Perfect weather to cuddle , watch movies , and drink Abuelita hot chocolate :) 
If u have a dog\ 
who has made u laugh , brightened ur life , silently accepted ur tears\

Where is my Dad when I need him ? I got a flat tire and he was no where to be found , U would think I would know how to change a flat being the daughter of a mechanic , but everytime I ask him to show me , he's too busy . Goal this wkd is to learn how to change a tire , anyone want to teach me ? 
I think I'm gonna start a donation box to Peru or I need to get a third job , this trip is turning out to be quite costly , even though my brother is paying for my flight . I have to get a flight from Lima to Cuzco and its $305 , so no more eating out for me , I spent like $250 in food last week , no mas ! 
So I'm with < PROPMALE > at the county and I spot a hottie who is translating Me : That guy is cute , and he speaks Spanish , works for social services hmm Clif : Why ? You want the benefits huh Me : Haha Noo I have benefits dork , BC we have similar backgrounds , MEN !

At the office on a Sunday ughh who does that ? and I can't focus , can someone write my notes for the past 10 days for me ? that's what I get for procrastinating , must focus ! Damn my ADHD ! lol

I just realized that I won't be home any wkd until Thanksgiving , how sad ! makes me want to go home and spend as much time as I can with my beloved bed . 
Is it bad that I'm going on a singles party cruise tomorrow but I'm more excited about the menu the ship has , than meeting a hot guy and partying ? ohh and they have a cushioned track so I can run , < PROPFEMALE > excited , well dressing up and going to the Captain's ball seems appealing to lol 
I always wanted to kiss a lion , and today I actually did , well he was a cub , but he'll be a big lion one day , super happy , made my day :) 
Does anyone have a backpacker's backpack I can borrow ? I need it for my trip to Peru which is like less than a month away OMG I think I'm going to start to panic , and I have no clue whatsoever how to pack lightly , to tell you I had a big ass suitcase for my 3 day cruise last wkd but < PROPFEMALE > informed me I won't be needing dresses or stilettos so I'm sure that will help and maybe I'll even go without makeup . 
I'm loving Veteran's day bc it only took me 30 < PROPFEMALE > to get to work instead of the almost 2 hrs it has been taking me these past 2 days I've been in training , and I have to say it sucks waking up < PROPFEMALE > early , can't wait to sleep in tomorrow til 8:30 and I miss the gym in the morning . Today is the last day I wake up early yay ! 
In Oakland with my sisters watching the fight , and even though I like Pacquiao , I find myself rooting for < PROPMALE > , I guess my blood is deeply rooted in Mexico , and TJ is where my Dad grew up so I gotta be loyal to my roots . 
Good fight ! All heart baby ! 
\Everyone who has run knows that its most important value is in removing tension and allowing a release from whatever other cares the day may bring . \ " - < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > "

My clutch went out again and a part of me wants to say FML but I refuse to think negative , but it does suck :( 
I find it kind of funny when people call me < PROPFEMALE > , when clearly my given name is spelled < PROPFEMALE > , what's < PROPFEMALE > hard about pronouncing the A ? LOL Not that I'm complaining , I hate when people call me by my first name and I actually prefer < PROPFEMALE > but its almost everybody , at the gym , the Dr's , teachers , u name it , they never pronounce the A , too funny ! 
Raiders better win because if they don't I have to buy my boo a Steeler jersey and put a Steeler sticker on my car but if the Raiders win I'm going to Oakland to watch a game Dec 19th , so please , please win Raiders ! 
Happy Bday to my original boo < PROPFEMALE > and my fav boss , well for 2 hrs , Vic , hope you guys have a wonderful bday , Luv ya both , like a fat kid and I luv cake !

I survived the Inka trail , it was a long four gruesome days that tested me physically n mentally , there were times when I asked myself wth was I thinking in thinking this would be fun but then I stopped n stared @ the beauty around me , how many people can say they climbed to the clouds ? Trekking with amazing people from all over the world & my LS < PROPFEMALE > Rojo was a humbling experience I'll never forget . 
Good luck to my HS , Centennial Huskies at the state championship today at the Home Depot , Goo Huskies !
