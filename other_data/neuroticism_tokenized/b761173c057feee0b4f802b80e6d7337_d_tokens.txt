New Urban Rivals guys tomorrow ! Pretty pumped about that ! 
Insect Research day ! \ 
Might work on my Latin names . 
Over the years people change . Some for the better , most for the worse . Whether it's to be cool or if it's to impress that one girl/guy that you have on your mind 24/7 . Countless hours of thinking lead to countless hours of regret . A second of pleasure can be devastating for a whole life time . I just wish that everyone could be how they used to be and be who they want to be . Because we all know that's not who they are 
Fantasy Factory ! \ 
Pretty much . \ 
Ochocinco is going to be on tonight ! 
The new season of The Colony is brutal ! \ 
I can't believe that they can attack the Colonists this year ! Amazing ! \ 
I don't like the Colonist as much of last year though . 
Dragonica all night ! \

So Bored . 
Going to take a bike ride to That's Entertainment then maybe to Newbury Comics to sell some CDs that I don't listen to any more . 
Going to subbing at Fitchburg High this Wednesday , next Wednesday , and October 13th ! \ 
Nervous about my first day as a substitute teacher . Hope this doesn't suck . 
Man if only they didn't give me a class that would be gangsters all day . 3 classes of them . If only they knew how to speak English in an English class . Nice to earn $65 though =P . \ 
Now sleep ! 
Man subbing is hard . If only kids had respect and discipline . Now-a-days they run around like they are the only ones in the world and they respect no one . Wicked immature . 
The Colony season finally that I missed last night due to the fact that I had to go and sub today . I can't wait to see what happened ! Thank you DVR ! 
I feel like total and udder crap . Man working with like 100 people has it's down side ... 
Going to play some Magic today with more advanced players ( no offense Vinh and < PROPMALE > ) . I hope that I'm not too noobish . 
So I guess that I have to work today and don't want to . I just wish that I can stay home and sleep today . 
I guess wishes do come true . They told me that they don't need me today . I guess that I'll play Left 4 Dead 2's mutation of Vs . Survivor . If you have Left 4 Dead or Left 4 Dead 2 for PC let me know and I'll add you on Steam .

Man I wish that I didn't have to wake up =/ . Going to get ready to go to That's Entertainment- North ! ( Fitchburg ) and then to my Dad's house for a party then bring < PROPFEMALE > Trick-or-Treating ! \ 
I just wish that I hadn't gotten home at 4:00 =/ . 
Organizing all of my Magic rares . \ 
If only that was an epic amount . 
If only my Magic trade binder was worth more than $247 like my Yu-gi-oh one that's like $800+ . Man I need more cards =/ . 
I feel wicked horrible . Not even sure if I'll make it to card night =/ .

Went 8-0 in games and 4-0 in matches . Hopefully going to the draft Saturday with < PROPMALE > Weed , < PROPFIRST > Halligan , and < PROPFIRST > Cunningham . I'm sure that seeing 1000 more Scars cards will just be peachy . 
Bed . 
I wish I wasn't this bored . I may just sleep ... lol\ 
Damn you Black Ops . 
Can't wait for my checks to get here . Then cashing them ! \ 
After that getting picked up by < PROPMALE > Weed to go to the MTG draft with him < PROPFIRST > Halligan , < PROPFIRST > Woods , < PROPFIRST > Cunningham , and < PROPFIRST > Diaz should be there . \ 
Man I hate Scars of Mirrodin ... 
If only the school system didn't miss one of my subbing days + my after school check . I'm pissed right now . \ 
I expressed my disinterest to my boss and hopefully she can make the wrong right . 
Bed . \ 
I hope that the schools don't need subs tomorrow . This way I can play the new map on A.V.A. all day . I haven't had more deaths than kills on it ! \ 
Pretty beast ! 
No one called me in =D ! \ 
But yeah , I'll be watching < PROPMALE > then Walking Dead . And after I do that I'll play A.V.A. until the after school program starts . 
Just build a new deck . Black/Blue . I may stop at That's Entertainment on my way home from work to get some cards for it .
