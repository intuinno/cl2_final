Listening to GWAR on Christmas < PROPFEMALE > , my grandparents would be so proud ... NOT ! 
blah , being sick sucks . Evern though I'm getting better , Have a constant plugged nose is REAL annoying 
WOO ! Finished writing some parts for various songs , and I almost finished a song for ? < PROPFEMALE > ?. Dont say anything about the hearts ... 
< PROPFEMALE > stening to Dragonforce then Fall of < PROPFIRST > , I have to wonder ... Is < PROPFIRST > Erak a better guitar player then Dragonforce's < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > ? I say yes , since < PROPFIRST > sings while he plays and his lines are all different . Please comment and say what you think as well . 
Heh , I SHOULD study for mock trial , and I SHOULD practice my song for Music , but Diablo is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO fun !!!! DAMN YOU DIABLO !!! 
Cleaning the house , < PROPFIRST>'s coming over tomorrow ! YEAH !! DUDES RULE !!!!!! ( PS IM NOT SEXIST !!!! I love women too ! ) 
Practicing songs , what fun . 
Woot ! It's 5:45 and I'm WIDE awake ! Have been for the last 45 minutes !!! 
DAMN DAMN DAMN ! Pulled my wrist again lifting weights ! I guess it wasn't better yet ... :( 
I relearned all the songs I had learned for JX2 in A tuning instead of standard ... Except tequlia and Blue Bossa or whatever the other bossa was called . 
It's 9 am on a Sunday and I'm Blaring the Devil Wears Prada's \Sassafrass\ " !!! YEAH !!!!!!!!! BTW good F'ING MORNING !!!!!! " 
Bleah , I'm tired , I miss < PROPFEMALE > , my homeworks due soon and I have to fix my old bag . But at least my Ipod has a full charge ! :) Let the UnderOATH marathon begin ! Starting with Lost in the Sound of Seperation ! ( That's backwards , < PROPFEMALE > me ) 
As the ground vanishes I wonder , will the sky be the next to fail me !? 
Now when I cast my eyes to open water , her image will appear . A vision of beauty broken , Her words forever spoken \How could you leave me here \"?!" 
There's a madman glaring straight at me ! Oh I know I've seen his face before ! I am sure I've seen his face before . 
Slow down , this is slippin ' through my mind . This conversation has run out of time . < PROPFEMALE > , I know you know what I mean and that's the one thing that you soon will find . 
Heh , this UnderOATH song sounds like he's saying \I'm not semen\ " ... Gross " 
Now this is my kind of Disaster , We're gonna take what we want and then burn down the liquor store . Pick up our friends , tell them it's on and then don't ask what it's for . Subwoofer kickin ' in , porn on the TV screen . These spinnin ' rims don't go no faster . I love Korn ... 
Please , girl stay till the early mornin ' . You can have some coffee , you can do my laundry . Please girl stay don't mind the clutter . Get back in bed yeah , < PROPFIRST > Mouse covers you girl on your body . 
And the teeth in his mouth became knives . Am I dreaming or is this real life ? My life slips away with each bite . 
weee ! < PROPFIRST>'s B-days tomorrow and I'm starting his gift NOW ! So much for no procrastinating 
Just keep the violence down Not yet - don't make a sound Oh God I'm feeling it It's reaching fever pitch My skin is caving in My heart is driving out No mercy , no remorse Let nature take its course 
St. < PROPFIRST > closed the gates of heaven Welcome to Babylon 2007 Empathy beats in our hearts no more So different looks your paradise When birthed by Satan's whore 
Weeping < PROPFEMALE > of < PROPMALE > Drops of blood drip off your petals Representing all our tears In a ring of burning metal 
YEAH ! My 5 year old little sister Sang \Carl Barker\ " with me ! All together now : JUST BECAUSE YOU MOVE YOUR HIPS DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU EXIST ! JUST BECAUSE YOU MOVE YOUR LIPS DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU MAKE SENSE ! " 
When it all falls down there will be two people : The People who live and the people who exist . When the machine of the world breaks down , the world will see the death of humanity and the beginning of something else ... 
I shut my eyes and once again the pleasure strangles me . I taste the tears of sweet indulgence , pain and fantasy . Oh , the visions inside my head ... The emptiness will haunt you ... Sanity is slowly slipping from my hands now . I'm standing closer to the edge than I should be allowed . Oh , what little regret I have ... Does that make me a killer ? 
\The yesterday we loved speaks of tomorrow . The burden of man is that time never takes a pause . We live from Monday to Sunday but forget what it means . Then a ghost comes to visit and we tell stories from tabloids Call all your friends watch fake photos from a made up vacation speaking in tongues about ancient artifacts \"- In Flames \ " Vacuum \"" 
\Are you ready to die ?! I'm so glad that all of you came ! Looking in I see a lonely man etching tallies into the bar . Looking on I see a desperate man repeating something to the floor . Oh how blood turns me on ... So sweet ... \"- Alesana's \ " the Murderer \"" 
I'm not tired ! I could night up all stay !!!!! 
IF < PROPMALE > doesn't come to school tomorrow , he really WILL be dead . Not just < PROPFEMALE > saying \he's dead \"." 
Bored bored bored bored bored ! Wouldn't be so bad but I've got writer's block right now , so that means no new music ! :( 
YAY ! Writer's block is cured ! 4 new songs on the way !!!!!! 
BTW Bat Boy was Awesome last night !!! 
Yuck , I burst a blood vessel in my eye . It doesn't hurt and my eye has this red blotch on it . Plus , it looks damn gnarly . Thanx for listening . 
had a weird day . < PROPFEMALE>'s in a foul mood , I'm tired of this damn blotch and I'm really tired . I also miss < PROPFEMALE > ... On the plus side I may be getting a job soon !!! Wish me luck ! 
YES ! That friggin ' blotch is disappearing ! YES YES YES ! GO AWAY !!! I wish I could say the same for school work ... 
has just turned in his application for work ... Let's all keep our fingers crossed and hope for the best ! 
The Blotch in my eye is almost a distant memory , but the lessons learned shall be taken to heart . For in the short time that it stayed it taught so much ... ( Don't ask why , just like it ) 
WHEEE ! My Bisceps are gonna kill me tomorrow ! I worked them out yesterday and today I did grunt work with my dad !!! Yeah , and I also wrote a new song ( called \stay down and stay dead \")" 
Now I'm gonna do my HW without music !!!! :( can it get any worse ?!?! Well , I guess I could have to listen to reggae or something , that stuff is terrible ... 
I need a pic of Seb and I screaming , any volunteers to take a picture tomorrow ? 
I miss < PROPFEMALE > ... Can't wait for Sunday !!!!

Why does everything have to be so damn confusing ??? 
Happiness is : a full charge on your Ipod ! 
Happiness is : a Dance < PROPMALE > Dance album of pure awesomeness ! EVERYBODY WITH ME ! Just because you move your hips , doesn't mean that you exist ! Just because , you move your lips , doesn't mean that you make sense ! 
Happiness is : a clear shot and a full clip . 
Happiness is : Spending the day with ? S ? A ? R ? A ? H ? ( well for me anyway ) 
Happiness is : reenacting the dialogue from \Rock Solid\ " with Tyler/Justyn/Sebby "

YAY ! I play tonight ! Hilo Burger Joint from 8:00 to 9:00 ! My fingers hurt from practicing , my shoulders hurt from lifting weights and my brain hurts from jotting down ideas for weirD's \Dreamwalker EP \"!" 
Listening to the new Megadeth album and the new Metallica album I have deduced that the new Megadeth album kicks the new Metallica album's ass with 1 arm , half a leg and a mental condition . < PROPMALE > wins , end of story ! 
I know I shouldn't swear on the web but , I was rudely informed last night that I WON'T be playing next Monday at Kea'au . All I can say is : FUCK !!! Ah well , this is the motivation I need to go get my own gig I suppose ... 
YEAH ! I'm gonna write 3 poems about the album I'm writing ( to pass the boredom) !!! I already finished part 1 ! Check it out in notes ! 
About halfway done writing the Dreamwalker EP ! W00T ! \\m/ ^o^ \\m/ 
Poems are done ... Wrote more lyrics for the EP . The new song is funny ! You're gonna love it Seb ! 
YES ! I have put all three parts of the Dreamwalker together to make one big peom ! CHECK IT OUT ! 
Is very much disturbed by < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE>'s < PROPFIRST > Bieber fan pics ... Is there no mercy in this world ??? 
Is recovering from a sore back and preparing for sore legs tomorrow ... I also want to find the coqui frogs nearby and pinch them till they pop , so it will be quiet . 
Wow , From Circa Survive to the Gypsy Kings to GWAR to Alesana to Cannibal Corpse ... I listen to alot of music ! 
Forgot just how much I loved GWAR ! GOR GOR is so flippin ' awesome ! I mean how can a giant T-Rex be any awesomer ? Have GWAR make it ! 
llew sdne taht llew slla 
Isn't it great that we can say the same thing and get 3 different reactions ? Great case : \I love You\ " GF : happy . Friend : creeped out . Random Girl : Angry . < PROPFIRST > Erak : Rock Solid ! " 
If all goes well I should have my first job on july 12th ! Early happy birthday gift I suppose ! 
Never again will I brag about my Ipod screen lock . F***ing thing won't come undone ! I for got my code ! Will forever use simple stuff like \1111\ " for Ipod code ... " 
Yes ! I have JUST learned the main riff for \Sugar Lumps\ " !!!!!!!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA !! " 
only one song's lyrics are unfinished for the Dreamwalker EP ... The finale ! ( called \lost in your embrace \")" 
This summer remember to be Rock Solid ! 
Hopefully between today and tomorrow I will be turning in my paperwork for work ! There's only 2 things left to do and one is really easy . The other however ... 
I turn my papers in tomorrow ! I'm at the finish line people ! YEAH ! I'm even gonna get to go to the beach AND see < PROPFEMALE > ! Tomorrow holds good promises ! It's too bad I'm gonna be 17 though ...

\Oh hey Jon ! \"" 
Whee , now comes the fun part ! Writing the actual playing parts for the Dreamwalker EP ! 
I celebrated my B-day early cause I'll be working tomorrow ! So far I have gotten a special kind of jelly , assorted random stuff ( such as a < PROPFIRST > Mustang patch & pencils ) , an Alesana shirt ( oh yeah ) , 2 PS2 controllers and the House of Dead 2&3 for the Wii ! 
Oh yeah ! First day of work was good ! Happy birthday to me ! 
Got the new Korn album !! I'M SO F***ING EXCITED !!!!!!!!! IT ROCKED SO HARD BEFORE I EVEN LISTENED TO IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Listening to it I must say \Korn is still good \"" 
Listening to Slipknot on shuffle I must wonder : what happened ? They were so awesome on the first two albums ! Then they went Metallica for the sake of money ( even though they were LOADED already ) and went downhill . Don't believe me ? Listen to \Snuff\ " ( from the new album ) then listen to \ " The Heretic Anthem \"." 
First week of work over with ... Yay ! - wait , there's HOW many more left ?!?!! 
\Love without affection is hate without the pain . \"- Korn's \ " The Past \"" 
\The ragged they come and the ragged they kill ! You pray so hard on bloody knees . \ 
WAAAAAAAAA ! I can't find my Social Security card to fill out a paper ! WAAAAAAAAAA WAAAAAAA WAAAAAA ! 
New Avenged Sevenfold album ... Meh , Waking the Fallen kicks it's ass in a big way . A7X is going down ! 
I just remembered something of utmost importance ! My mom bought her jeans in the children's section of Sears !!! So both she and her co-workers 11 year old daught share the same size ! They absolutely MUST dicuss the best acessories . ;D 
Weeee , writing music is fun ! When you don't have writers block ! 2 songs out of 8(I think ) done ! 
Isn't it funny that after 30 years the Ramones still rock ( and will rock for another 30 ) but after 6 months Fall Out Boy sounds so dated ? 
\I fell from grace and I'm not going back ! You come to me with the image of a better life ! I'm F*cking fine with the life I have ! I'd rather burn then spend another second by your side ! \ " Winds of Plague's \ " Forged in Fire \""

Oh yeah ! 4 songs written for the Dreamwalker EP ! THe 5th is halfway done , I've got a good effects system working and I've found the guitar I wanted ( A Douglas/Agile 7 string for $189 ) 
Heh heh , there is a book called \For the Win\ " at the Library where I work . " 
After putting away books at the library I'm convinced that children below 12 should NOT be allowed to touch the books !!! 
he he , I have about 5 things due soon , and I haven't started ... ( 1 due tomorrow that HAS been started though ) . 
I swear learning how to play RUSH's \Far Cry\ " on Bass is gonna kill me faster than trying to sweep pick on guitar ... " 
Is burning breakfast ! 
\The best of Nickelback\ " would be a blank CD if I ruled the world ... 3 :) " 
Tomorrow at 5:45 Pm < PROPFEMALE > and I will make 2 years ! STOKED !

Yay ... Working on my movie , still . At least it's gonna be awesome ! It has < PROPFIRST > Erak in it ! kinda ... 
Yesterday I spent 9 1/2 hours working on my movie ... I'm gonna need another 6 or so to finish it by tomorrow ... I need to finish the animating ( not difficult ) , do the voice work/sound effects ( not fun ) and string it all together ( WAY not fun ) . * sigh , why do I do this to myself ? 
Goin ' to the fair today ! Goin to te fair today ! Wait , how in the hey am I supposed to work on < PROPFEMALE > movie den ? 
\As the sun slips the tearaway stars \ 
Wow , I just figured out the intro and main riff to Fall of < PROPFIRST>'s \F . C . P . R . E . M . I . X\ " . It's SO easy ! It's just a bunch of arpeggios with really fast reverb . " 
\There’s a place that I’ve found\ 
1 more check and I shall have my guitar ! STOKED ! 
excuse me , kind gentleman ? can you tell me what it means to be a man ? 
Without looking up the lyrics , I wonder who can figure out exactly what the hell < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > is screaming in the beginning of \Daggers Speak Louder Than Words\ " . I'm SO glad that he and Milke took singing lessons before making \ " The Emptiness\ " . I was really tired of Milke's shrill pig squeals . " 
New music today , new Chiodos album ( so much better without < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE>'s ) . New Bring me the Horizon album ( I miss Oli Sykes ' screams , but the music is still good ) . 
Where Did < PROPFIRST > go ? < PROPFIRST > Stratsburblahblahblahfitch is gone ! 
( almost ) Anything but do my homework ... 
Okay so I stayed up ' til one in the morning working on that stupid paper for what ?! So you could tear it apart and criticize everything I did and say that I didn't look hard enough or do it right !? Hmm if I recall correctly I looked up everything you told me too !!!!!!!! SCREW THIS PROJECT ! 
Okay , one project down , 3 more to go ... 
Ordered the guitar today ! BIG SMILES ! 
The guitar was worth every < PROPFEMALE > ! ITS SO AWESOME ! PICTURES SHALL FOLLOW ! 
Totally should record today , I have the song written out ... Just need to program a drum beat ( bleah , I hate drums ) and then the songs totally written . It's called \We are Heavy\ " . It's really funny in a stupid kind of way . " 
Blah , F'in RUSH song ... Learning Subdivisons ' bass , synth and vocal parts ! 
Yayz , I can do basic diminished sweep picking on a 7 string ! < PROPMALE > would be so proud ! \ 
Actual chord arpeggio sweeps next ! Then , onto faster diminished sweep picking in different progressions ( as opposed to a line down and back up) ! 
Translated my P-SAT score : between 2000-2300 . The < PROPMALE > score is 2400 ... All I can say is \Wow \"." 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas ! Now get the hell off Facebook and go celebrate it with your families like I'm about to !
