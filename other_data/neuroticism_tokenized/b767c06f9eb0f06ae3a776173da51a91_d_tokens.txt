Had a great day visiting < PROPMALE>'s aunt < PROPFEMALE > in Cincy . < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > even came over for a bit so that was an added bonus . 
chilling in her pj's at home with her girl . 
is thinking about going to bed soon . 
has been defeated by < PROPFEMALE>'s new dresser . I conceded and told < PROPMALE > he would have to finish putting the stupid back on it . Which he did in like 30 minutes including the time it took him to hunt up the left over finishing nails from our bathroom project . I got the entire dresser put together and could not get the back on it !!!!! I have even assembled all of the drawers but one . 
Rain , rain and more rain . 
I had to fight my girl to get her to put her pj's on and brush her teeth she wanted to go to bed now and skip all that stuff . To top it off she is \camping\ " out on the floor in the extra room . She had her sleeping bag on the floor and pulled the cover off the bed . It's been two hours and she's still in there all covered up . She even stole a pillow off the couch . " 
is trying to stay ahead of the laundry , dishes and maybe sneak in some cleaning .

Is leaving the < PROPMALE > zoo . 
Well , it's almost midnight and I had to put < PROPFEMALE > to bed in her own room after several attempts to let her go to bed with DJ's girls . They are still awake and had to have a 2nd snack before going back to bed . Lol ! 
The 2nd one just went to sleep . One to go .
