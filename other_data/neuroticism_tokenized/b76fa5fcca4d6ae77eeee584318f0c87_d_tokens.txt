Getting ready to move into the Phoenix Downtown area :-) 
It was peak hour on I-17 . Suddenly , this cop enters into the freeway and makes its way onto the carpool < PROPFIRST > quite damn fast throwing his cop car at every car on I-17 at that moment . As it's entering the carpool < PROPFIRST > , some person in a truck is coming real fast and honks at the cop because it got on his way . When that happened I started cracking up and all I thought was \HAHA ! Que blanquillos de carbon ! \"" 
So , I think - There's no way out ... There's no where to run ... My only way is to go forward , straight ... strong ... I ask myself ... many things that make me doubt , but there's really no option but to go on . 
Et je parle avec douleur ....
