A 15 year old girl holds her 1 year old son ; people call her a slut . But no one knew she was raped at 13 . Make fun of someone for being fat , but you don't know that person has a serious medical condition that causes her to be obese . Call the old guy ugly , but .. you 1don't know he got a serious face injury after serving the country or saving a life . Re-post this if you're against bullying and stereo typing !! 
The greatest man in history , named Jesus , had no servants , yet they called Him master . Had no degrees , yet they called Him teacher . Had no medicines , yet they called Him healer . He had no army , yet kings feared Him . He won no military battles , yet He conquered the world . He committed no crime , yet they crucified Him . He was buried in a tomb , yet He lives today . Re post if you believe in your heart this is true !!!
