A company was conducting a password audit due to a recent breach . To identify weaknesses you were asked your PW then you would immediately change it . When interviewing one employee she replied \huey duey luey < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > pluto < PROPFIRST > snow white sacramento\ " Asked why her password was so long the young blonde responded \ " Well we were told our password had to have at least 8 characters and one capital \"" 
In life we do not always get what we want ... What I have learned is \Rejection is God's Protection\ " Just say \ " Thank-you God\ " accept the lesson and move on ! "

Life is good ... My daughter in college has a movie audition today , my son that's in college too just won a mix m < PROPMALE > ial < PROPMALE > tournament , and my youngest a 10th grader planned how she's going 2 get duel credit for both HS and college . The point is as parents we know our children listen to little we say & everything we do . By God's strength & seeking to live my dreams , my kids are making the effort to live theirs too ! 
It is raining so hard in SA , when I got out of class I could not see where I parked my car ... Totally drenched ... lol 
It's not about when you , make a million dollars , loose weight , find a new job/boyfriend/husband/girlfriend/wife , start a business , when the kids finish school , when you finish school , take a vacation , etc ... It's learning to find JOY in life everyday ! Live in the present life is good ... 
A very good day ... Was able to use some of the talent God has given us to share with others .

Hair Care Professional both users of our Xcel Nutraceuticals products , knocked it out of the park . Great reviews :-)

I voted today ... took all of five minutes . Early voting ends Friday and most locations are open until 8pm . The most interesting thing I saw that at the polling site were the 10's of 10's of signs posted everywhere but , not one < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > sign ... hmmmmmm . Don't let voter apathy get you , let your voice be heard . 
Today in San < PROPFIRST > it was a little chilly in the 40's . I saw a man with a cast on his elevated leg as he rode on the sidewalk in his mobilized wheelchair . Wearing an old British style wig ( like Geo . Washington ) and Snuggie with a beer in his hand . He inspired me cause I went and bought me one too . Not the wig or beer but the Snuggie ... lol Not sure which one kept him warmer . 
Although a proud mom of all my children , today I have to give a shout-out to my son , who moved to Philly to attend college . The east coast has been hit hard with blizzards this winter , today being no exception . In this cold snowy blizzard like weather his SUV stuck and having a job interview several blocks away , my son walked to it . As parents we wonder if our kids will ever grow up , then they do ... 
Just got home 1604 is a mess seen numerous trucks flipped over and accidents @ least 12 , btwn 151 and Bandera . Why do folks with trucks think they do not have to slow down in bad weather ? 
Japan is on many of our minds ... The US has 104 licensed Nuclear Plants with 4 being in Texas . Texas does have an earthquake fault line running through it to the mid-west states . If something were to happen would you know what to do ? or Which items you would need for your family ? It's something to think about .
