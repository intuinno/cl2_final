I hope everyone had an amazing year !!! 2010 , here we go again-January ... 

Imagine there's no heaven , it's easy if you try . No hell below us ; above us only sky . Imagine all the people living for today . You may say I'm a dreamer but I'm not the only one . I hope someday you will join us and the world will live as one . 
He is their worst enemy to the extent that he is ignorant of them . -or- Come with me , my dear young friend . 
definitely sees that facebook is better than myspace , now that I'm actually using it . The focus is less on the creativity of one's < PROPFEMALE > and more on the ease of communication between people . And it's a lot easier to find old friends , since it lists everyon 
feels humbled and awed by the fact that having traveled to six countries and at least 43 cities in my lifetime , I have still only seen 2% of the world . 
I love the rain ? 
Will got a facebook ! Finally 
2 weeks ! I'm in count-down mode now . :) 
Goodbye to all my friends and family in Arizona , California , Utah , Ohio , < PROPFEMALE > ... I will miss you all ! I'll post pictures and send postcards when I can :) 
What is there to say about Italy ? It's fantastic , of course :) 
I am in a bar in Sorrento with Booay and < PROPFEMALE > ! Io amo Italia ! 
It's been a crazy awesome week-we went spelunking and cave exploring on Wednesday , and today we just got back from seeing several etruscan tombs in Sovana and then spending the rest of the day in Pitigliano , a charming little town in Tuscany , surrounded by lush green and near by a few beautiful waterfalls . <3 
On my way to Germania adesso ... sooo excited !!! 
Germany is wonderful and I'm having fun getting to know all my cousins-they are all so sweet :) 
Spain is crazy ! Crazy spanards . I don't know how they do this all the time ! 
Last week of school ! And first time I'm really sad about it :( 
It's been rainy and < PROPFEMALE > and cold today . But Will's coming Thursday , Will will you bring the Arizonan sun with you to Orvieto ? 
Will's here !!!!!! 
You can see the Duomo of < PROPFEMALE > from our hotel window !!!!!!! Not to make you jealous or anything ... ;) 
We are back in Orvieto for one more night ! Awe it feels like I'm coming from a long weekend back home ! :( 
Practica italiano con me ? 
There are 500 people in my Classical Mythology class at 11am TR in 30 < PROPFEMALE > ... One of you has to be in class with me ! Anyone ? Let's meet up . :) 
Does anyone play the guitar and would anyone be willing to teach me ? 
What do you think our dreams mean , if anything ? 
Has anyone else noticed ... what a beautiful day it is today ? <3 
Don't settle for anything but spectacular <3 
I'm so in my own world today , disconnected with reality , la mia testa e ' fra < PROPFEMALE > nuvo < PROPFEMALE > ... 
I've had the Beatle's stuck in my head all day . What's your favorite Beatle's song ? Mine's ' Blackbird . ' But there are so many good ones to choose from ... !!! \Blackbird singing the dead of night Take these broken wings and learn to fly ... \ " <3 Hope everyone's having a good day :) " 
The clouds ... the color of the sky ... They're perfect today . <3 Che < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE>' giorno ( What a pretty day ) . ... Even if it's only in Tucson ... ;) 
\Nothing lasts forever - not even your troubles . \ " - < PROPMALE > H Glasgow :) " 
Sadness today as I drive past a mobile home park named \Villa Capri\ " and realize that that might in fact be the closest I get to Italy around here ... " 
I feel like the fool , and the world's laughing at me , today . 
If my room is descriptive of my mind ... the word \chaos\ " comes to mind ... and not even the organized kind ! Time to clean ... " 
<3 s you ! :) 
' Cause nothing lasts forever , even cold November rain ...

Going to < PROPMALE > Horror tonight with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > . You should come too ! 
... I would love to become a philosophist . Although I feel I will never be a good philosophist because I can never seem to come to a conclusion about anything ... because there are so many sides , and so many ways to think about things ... and they're all contradicting ... So how is one to think ? Maybe this is why Taoism was invented ... 
It's like having good dreams but you're still awake ... 
I'd buy you Rogaine when you start losing all your hair ; sew on patches to all you tear ... <3 
Hmmmm .... 
Days go by so slow ... Summer will never come ... 
Is no one awake ? I can never sleep anymore ... Feel a bit like < PROPFIRST > Durden at the beginning of Fight Club ...

Someone help me find the fountain of youth ! Quick ! Before I turn 20 ! 
Sei sempre nel mio cuore , ti penso sempre . <3 
Was looking at old photos ... Silliness . =) 
< PROPFEMALE > , I love you , and I'm sorry . I hope you can forgive me . That's all that I can say . They are only words , but I promise you they are meant from my heart . :(

Listening to < PROPFEMALE > Keys instantly makes me think of < PROPFEMALE > . I miss my roommates . <3 :( 
< PROPFEMALE > Kane-remember passing around the chocolate and studying ? I miss it <3 My room gets awfully lonely without the company sometimes ... And < PROPFEMALE>'s singing and dancing ! lol 
I had a dream that I could fly from the highest swing <3

\What is the object ... of your distraction ? \ " -Wifey " 
Where does time go ? It leaves without saying goodbye , it's gone before I can know it well ; the now becomes the then ever too quickly . 
You are the only one who can obtain and accomplish what you < PROPFEMALE > . But harder than having the will ( which paves the way ) of going after that which you * think * you want is having the knowledge of what you * truly * want . \ 
* Inquistive look , pondering pondering .... Yup ; definitely don't have any answers yet myself ! Maybe eventually ... I'll figure it out ;) 
2 weeks from today and we'll be leaving for London !! Craziness !!!!

Enough gardening ... Siesta time :) 
Going away party tomorrow ! 
Maybe there is such a thing as \too much\ " fun ... " 
Just as you start to feel you have everything figured out , you realize how dead wrong you were about it all 
L'ultima notte in Italia !
