thinks that ninja < PROPMALE > is the best < PROPMALE > ever ! Even better than the < PROPMALE > hot dog guy ... and BELIEVE me , in my book , that is saying MUCH ! 
is going to indulge in yummy Toppings . Yay ! 
I have come to the conclusion that graveyards and < PROPFEMALE>'s already grrr demeanor are not a good mix . 
What the hell is up with the record searchlight not quoting correctly from a valid source ?? I am ready to go and beat a b****'s ass !! 
Working nights has definitely made me even more anti-social . I feel that overall I am disgusted with so many people and things . Thank goodness I have wonderful coworkers that keep me sane . 
Thank you sweet Jesus ! The weekend is finally here !! 
The more I hear about the new < PROPFEMALE > Wars MMO the more excited and impatient I get ! 
Has anyone else noticed that Crayola crayons are starting to feel like those cheap ass < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > crayons ? I was very disappointed . 
I watched Paranormal Activity this weekend . Being raised < PROPMALE > Catholic ( and Mexican ) , this movie scared the crap out of me . I won't have any problems staying awake during my graveyard shift . 
Is it wrong to call the cops on a bum that was just pissing me off ? I think not !! 
Left 4 Dead 2 comes out tomorrow , and I am not as excited as I thought I would be . :*( 
Front row watching New < PROPFEMALE > . I saw the hot Native American guy bust out of his clothes and turn into a wolf . I couldn't help myself- I yelled out \I WANT ONE\ " way . too . loud . I think I disgusted the mothers of the teeny boppers watching the movie . I also think that I embarassed < PROPMALE > beyond all imagination . I still stand by what I say : I want one ... for Christmas . " 
I feel yucky ! 
What a beautiful day ! I love the rain and cold weather ! 
Finals are around the corner ! YIKES !

Only three more days until 500 Days of Summer is released on DVD . ** Yay ** 
iTunes , for some reason , has recommended \Get Low\ " as a song I should purchase . I am so scared and confused . I need some Crunk . " 
Gotta run ! My friends : please pray for < PROPMALE>'s dad , < PROPMALE > , and his family . An unfortunate medical event has occurred , and they really need divine assistance from the Lord . 
I'm home . I'm tired . I need a beer . 
Thanks for all the prayers and support ! Things are looking better , and my < PROPMALE > is coming home tonight .

Very sick doogy at home = a very sad < PROPFEMALE > .... 
I may be slowly going insane listening to The Cure , Joy Division , and The Smiths .... sing me to sleep ... 
It's my birthday weekend , and I just found out that no one at home has any plans for me . Looks like it's going to be just me and a bottle of Stolichnaya . Happy effin birthday to me . 
Going to play some L4D2 and enjoy the gore .

Just finished getting my ass handed to me by my personal trainer . He sure was pissed when he found out I nearly ate my weight in Girl Scout cookies ( ok , so it was one box- suck it ! ) . I am pretty sure I was sweating out Samoas during my cool down . Grrr ! Girl Scouts are evil temptors , and I am EASILY tempted . Double Grr .... 
Yummy ! Moroccan red lentil soup is delicious and low cal/fat ! What a delicious way to end my day .

Damn that Lady GaGa ! That tranny sure knows how to get a tune stuck in my head . What was really sad was that \Bad Romance\ " started playing in my head when I saw Hot guy who shall remain unnamed . I feel gross . " 
I am in dire need of sleep . 
How the hell did I become such a loser ? Saturday night with a glass of pinot noir and FARMVILLE ! Someone shoot me now .... 
Why can't I kick ass as Medic when playing TF2 ?!? Grrr .... This will not defeat me .

My phone is dead . Dead dead . Whatever shall I do ? Not having a phone will make me even more of a hermit . Bummer . 
Listening to my old Salt n Peppa casette .... I'm still dreaming of being Spinderella !

Dang it ! Why can't I find anyone who wants to watch a quasai gay vampire and a hot werewolf with me ! What is this world coming to ! 
We all get freaked out from time to time , but we keep trying because you\ 
have to figure : if the world fattest twins can find love , there’s hope \ 
for all of us . Somewhere out there , there’s another little freak who’ll\ 
love us , understand us , will kiss our three heads , and make it all \ 
better 
“As\ 
we drive along this road called life , occasionally a gal will find \ 
herself a little lost . And when that happens , I guess she has to let go \ 
of the ' coulda ' , ' shoulda ' , ' woulda ' , buckle up and just keep going . ”- < PROPFEMALE > bradshaw , SATC

Hm .... \ 
My new mission in life is to find a Canuck to marry . \

Maybe I should just remain single for eternity ... or become a nun . 
I am trying to adjust to my new haircut . I finally did it , but was it the right choice .... 
I'm much to young to feel this damn old . 
So , Peninsula or South bay ? It is so hard to choose .... 
Boo for atypical pneumonia . Why me ?! 
Wow , what a morning at work ! My adrenal medulla released way too much epinephrine for me to sleep . 
So my new doctor is having me go organic , fresh , and vegan . I know that it's for my own good , but I'm not quite sure I am ready to end my 25 year love affair with cheese . Damn it . 
Shopping organic and vegan is super pricey , but I am pleased 
Vegan pizza is delish ! I totally rocked it with lots of mushrooms , figs , apricots , and herbs , and soy cheese . It sounds strange , but it was awesome ! 
I'm trying to catch some sleep before work , but I've got friggin Sigue Sigue Sputni's Love Missile song stuck in my head . 
Just finished watching The Road . I love this movie , and the little messages it sends out . It was tragic and beautiful at the same time . 
Today I didn't even have to use my AK . I got to say , it was a good day .... 
Philadelphia ? I'm not quite sure that < PROPFEMALE > is ready for me .... 
While looking on < PROPFEMALE>'s top 40 charts , I saw something so disturbing :\ 
< PROPFIRST > Bieber and Ludacris . Ew Ew Ew . 
The finish line is in sight . I can almost taste victory . Thank you , God , for helping me along the way . I would have remained lost without you . 
Good conversation with a good person last night . Being able to talk freely and openly about God's love and my love for God always makes my day . =) 
Love having an hour long ( joyful ) conversation with my daddy about baseball . Go Giants !!! 
I will not drop the Sager on a patient again . I will not , will not , will not . \

Yay ! Got my hair done and my spirits lifted today . My stylist is seriously one of the coolest chics EVER . 
Wow , what a day ! I hate having to be the responsible one in the family right now . Couldn't I have stayed the spoiled baby forever ? 
Fallout New Vegas . I should have called in sick ! 
Jeeze , I forgot how pricey things are in the city . Found a possible job , now I need a place !

\In the past I’ve always had trouble on my mind . \ 
How I wish I was at Union Square with the ones I love and miss ... 
If you look at the horizon there is always something ducking out of sight 
I am so tired of some people . There really is no point in pretending to be someone you're not . Sorry to break it to you , but life is not a popularity contest . It is not about who you < PROPMALE > out with last week , or what frivolous spending you do . There is so much more to life , like loving and grieving . Open your eyes . 
Bandit , my doggy , is very loved . He died this morning in my arms . The vet gave him an antiemetic that may have caused direct liver failure . My poor baby is gone ... 
I do not like Droids .... 
Trying to figure out these new high tech phones is making me feel old 
Best get new dreams , these old dreams won't last 
Painting rooms sure takes a long time . I should just take a nap with my < PROPFEMALE > . 
I could listen to Amid < PROPFIRST > forever . Add a never ending glass of wine to that ... heavenly ... 
Am I the only one at work who cannot stand the sound of creaking doors ? Wd40 , anyone ? 
Damn you , WOW . I have gone back to nerd . Perhaps I never really left .... 
Totally enjoying my night by watching old school episodes of Iron Chef . 
Getting older .... I can hear my biological clock a tickin'! Better tell it to shut up ..... 
Why did I have a nightmare about a tennis ball machine and an endless supply of tennis balls ? Damn you , Remi Vista ..... 
To dye or not to dye .... 
Opportunity knocks once then the door slams shut . 
Accepted to Texas A&M . Apparently the main campus has a Bush library . Oh my ..... 
Boo for Verizon , hello At&t 
Darn you Green Bay , come on Steelers ! 
Febrile and restless ..... 
Getting hit on by a creepy special < PROPMALE > teacher totally makes me want to hurl .
