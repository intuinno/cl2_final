HAPPY NEW DECADE , EVERYBODY ! 

I am now , OFFICIALLY , a University of Washington Bothell 2009 Alumnus . ( Thank you , God ! ) 
Happy 4th , everybody . UP THE REBELS !!! 
Beginning 12 days sans-kid , as he goes to his dad's for part of their summer vacation . A break ? Sure , and could use it and the time it affords for job-hunting . Miss him ? ALWAYS . Love you , Pud . 
Everyone I know has either GONE or is GOING somewhere fun ... < pout > . Maybe I'll pitch a tent in my backyard , blast some river noise , dangle my feet in < PROPFIRST>'s paddling pool and call it good . Whatever . \I . I . \ " and Family are due to arrive soon . I am blessed . " 
YES !!!!!!! My prayers have been answered . The UNHCR did its job and Ash , my best Iraqi TLP friend , is coming ... he's coming ! He's coming ! He's coming ! He's coming ! He was the centerpiece of my senior seminar paper , my poster , and has been central to my h 
I love my attorney . I hate this infernal sh*t , but I thought I'd send out some good attorney vibes to the universe ; couldn't hurt , right ? 
I get < PROPFIRST > back today - YAY !! Hey , twelve days away is a long time in preschooler years . Stay cool , everybody ( SEATTLEITES : You'll look back fondly on these hot days when we're paddling around in the rain come November ;-)) . 
I.I. comes in TODAY to Sea-Tac ! WOO-HOO !!! And he's bringin ' Iraq's weather with him , LOL . But whatever . He's finally outta there , moving here , and I'm gonna thoroughly enjoy today :-) . Try to stay COOOOOOOOOL , everyone ! 
TOUCHDOWN . Welcome to the United States of < PROPFEMALE > , to freedom and relative safety , \Iraqi Interpreter\ " and Family . I love you all . Life Is Beautiful :-) . " 
THANKS , < PROPFIRST > !! Mr. Man O ' Mystery . I had an absolute blast at the game . Too bad the M's lost - in retrospect , the top of the first maybe should've told us something - but I had a grand time . Was even treated prior to the game to a special Q&A with Mariners GM < PROPFIRST > Zduriencik and his right-hand dude , < PROPFIRST > Blengino ; now , THERE is a serious baseball fandom good time . 
Trying to kinda figure out a whole bunch of Life Stuff while simultaneously going with the flow ( oxymoron , anyone ? ) . 
We have cleared the tower ... ASH IS COMING !!! Kuala Lumpur ... Sweden ... Newark , New Jersey . ETA , 10 AM ( EST ) Thursday morning . Safe Journey , my dear friend . See you at our Skype party ! :-) 
OMG ... now THAT was a precious moment . Got to talk to Ash the moment the car pulled up with him to < PROPFEMALE>'s house :-) . Welcome to the United States and Freedom , Ashraf ! I love you , my dear friend !! 
Finding J a doctor ... finding me a job ... working on my resume ... working with < PROPFEMALE > ... wishing I was somewhere else . That's enough from this mind , for the moment . 
Another dear Iraqi friend is flying today :-) . Godspeed , < PROPMALE > ... 
Baghdad , my friends there , and their families . That's what's on my mind . 
Missing the Wee Blond One just a bit tonight ( okay , more than a bit , but he'll be back Monday ! ) . 
I'm thinking about ... Achilles and his heel ( blame FB , it's the one that asked ) . 
My ( technically , step-) grandmother , < PROPFEMALE > ( < PROPFEMALE > ) Early , who passed away yesterday . Age ? One-hundred years , 256 days . Totally awesome . Sturdy Kansas stock with a heart of gold . She is in my thoughts and prayers , as is the Chico , CA Early Clan . Love you guys . 
I'm thinking of making a big batch of Chicken Tortilla Soup today ( fascinatin ' , huh ) . One question , though : How did it get to be \soup\ " weather already ?? " 
Peace . 
Networking with good people :-) ( had a useful and pleasant meeting with someone tonight ) . 
< PROPFIRST>'s first day of all-day kindergarten ... < sigh > . But ... YAY , < PROPFIRST > !!! You're gonna love it , Pud . I love you . 
Another wonderful friend just arrived with his family in San < PROPMALE > . Welcome to the United States , Monk !! :-) ( phone calls from Amman will no longer be necessary , LOL ) . 
Faith . 
Hope . 
Thinkin ' ' bout ... safe arrivals . Welcome to the United States , < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > . Enjoy the reunion with your friends ! 
I could just KISS my attorney right now ... :-) :-) :-) . 
GO HUSKIES !!! Put the Trojans in their place . 
Baseball playoffs will soon be upon us ( how'd that happen ?! ) , football's already here , the leaves are turning and sunlight mixes with a bit of a chill . Happy Fall , everybody . 
Thinking all good thoughts for < PROPMALE > , one of my oldest and dearest friends . Love you , big guy . Get well SOON . < PROPFIRST > and I will come visit you and your girls ASAP ! 
Sixty-five pages of exhibits ; okay , is he kiddin' ?! ( never mind . I'll just go back to shaking my head in utter disbelief now ) . 
Possibilities ... 
To Whom It May Concern ( you know who you are ): All is well here . Life is beautiful . No worries . 
Life can be weird . LOL ................... 
Happy 6th Birthday , < PROPFIRST > ! I loved having breakfast with you today and I hope you're enjoying your party at Daddy's . I LOVE YOU !!! 
Ready for this silly joint pain thing to go away . 
5:30 and it's dark already . Think I'll ever get used to this time change thing ?? 
A wonderful , fun-filled weekend culminates in a fever for < PROPFIRST > and what appears * might * be Fifth Disease , which we were told had been running through his school about a week ago . Ah , well ... such is childhood ( < PROPFIRST > just wants to stay home tomorrow and finish the < PROPFEMALE > Wars Lego ship he got at his party today anyway , LOL ) . Stay healthy , everybody ! 
El Paso , fevers , fridges and contempt , OH MY ! ;-) 
Ft . Hood . Tragic :-( ( and BTW , A . wishes to extend his profound thanks to those who contacted me to ask about his welfare ! But he's at Ft . Bliss right now ) . 
And ...... < EXHALE ...... aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh > . Huh . Never thought I'd enjoy hearing the word ' egregious ' quite so much . 
Veterans Day , and a few people in my life I've lost . THANK YOU to all my Veteran friends out there ; y'all are the very best . 
A < PROPFEMALE > ( miniscule , even ) beam of light at the end of a long , dark tunnel might be all it takes . Here's hopin ' ... 
TWO YEARS ' worth of separation and waiting has finally ended for my dear friend , Amir . What a perfect way to celebrate Thanksgiving and to begin the holidays , by reuniting with his wife and young daughter who have finally , just today arrived in the States . What a blessed day this truly is . 
Thirty-four degrees right now and frosty ; how did we already reach December ?! 
I am very proud of my dear friend , < PROPMALE > , who just became the first Iraqi in either of the Carolinas to enlist in the US Air Force . Great job , J ! 
Been sick , cold and a little grumpy . Bah . 
Great friends , an actual functional ( and wonderful ) relationship ... who knew ?! 
< PROPFIRST > just got his first-ever report card . You're doin ' great , babe ! :-) 
I'll miss you , < PROPFIRST > , while you're at Daddy's . But we'll have a wonderful time come Christmas afternoon , and for a week thereafter ! Love you bunches , Pud . 
Today . 
Safe journey , my love . ' Til next time , I love you .

Breathing . Calm . Zen . Attorney . Good . Goodnight , good people in my life . 
Forget FanFest ; in my world , countdown to Spring Training starts NOW [ 43 days ] ( props to < PROPFIRST > for that ) . Hernandez , < PROPFIRST > , Ichiro , Gutierrez , Figgins , < PROPMALE > ... ahhhhh ... BASEBALL ( Super Bowl ... what ? ) . 
Parent/teacher conference today . The upshot ? < PROPFIRST > is one sweet , friendly , smart , AWESOME kid ! :-) ( I'm paraphrasing , of course , but WTH ... ) . 
WIN . ALL COUNTS ( thank you , < PROPFEMALE >!) . Five years to the day since I was told he wanted a divorce ( hey , the day before your B-day is kinda hard to forget ) . You gotta love irony . 
Thanks for the day , Mom ( well , and Dad too , of course , LOL ) . 
Thanks for all the warm & wonderful birthday wishes , everybody . < PROPFIRST > and I really had a terrific day together with friends and family :-) . Love to all ! 
Paranoia and idiocy - one in the same ?? YOU MAKE THE CALL ! ( goodnight , all . It's been something of a long day . Plus , clearly , I've been watching too much football lately ) . 
\Love has nothing to do with what you are expecting to get – only with what you are expecting to give – which is everything . \ " ~ < PROPFEMALE > Hepburn " 
Critical resume and app in ... CHECK . Need all the good thoughts and warm fuzzies flowing for me here , people . And thanks for that , ahead of time :-) . 
Life is f'ing weird ... but beautiful , at times . I am humbled by the power of love , in all its forms .

< PROPFIRST > . < PROPFIRST > . The Guys . All Good . 
A little corner of heaven can be found in < PROPFIRST > , TX ; I mean , seriously ... who knew ?! 
Happy to be with my < PROPFIRST > today . I love you , < PROPFIRST > . 
Back . Looking forward to seeing < PROPFIRST > tomorrow ; I miss him !! Missing My Boys , though , as well , and already - vacations are , indeed , very good for the soul . ' night , folks ...

Baseball UPDATE : Pitchers and catchers reported today and the first Spring Training game is in 12 days . PLAY BALL . ( @Mark : Enjoy your dogs tonight . Wish I could join y'all!)

Pendergrass ... Gershwin ... Gaye : the perfect \reminder\ " trifecta . " 
Beannachtaí na Féile Pádraig . 
Could someone PLEASE get \Copacabana\ " out of my head ?! LOL ... almost anything would be an improvement . Thanks . " 
Still giggling over < PROPFIRST>'s discovery of the Karaoke translation error in Phnom Penh last night : \Love Position No . 9\ " ... LOL . Classic . Way to turn a one-hit-wonder into something unforgettable ... " 
A wonderful lunch with Sabah & Family and then partyin ' with < PROPFEMALE > & DC 20 Friends for her birthday ... a very good day :-) . 
< PROPFEMALE > nobis pacem . 
I give you a new commandment : love one another . As I have loved you , so you should love one another . This is how all will know that you are my disciples , if you have love for one another . < PROPFIRST > 13:34 -35 [ NAB ] 
Now they were < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > the mother of < PROPFIRST > ; also , the other women with them were telling these things to the apostles . But these words appeared to them as nonsense , and they would not believe them . But < PROPFIRST > got up and ran to the tomb ; stooping and looking in , he saw the linen wrappings only , and he went away to his home , marveling at what had happened . < PROPMALE > 24:10 -12 [ NAB ] 
PLAY BALL . 
One down ( W ! ) , one hundred sixty-one to go ... 
GO < PROPMALE > !!! For the love of all that is holy ( or otherwise ) , man , do something good for the M's ... 
As ever , thanks for the soul food , ladies :-) . 
Off to watch the M's game and enjoy the evening with friends . Come on , Hyphen , let's go ! 
Thank you , Samia . If anyone becomes interested , I would be happy to explain the context in which that iMovie on the Taliban was made ; THAT SAID , I make no apologies and take full responsibility for its narrative . 
An Iraqi friend of mine is becoming a United States citizen tomorrow . He is already enlisted in the U.S. Army and is very excited . Congratulations , Mustafa . I am proud of you and will be proud to have you as a fellow citizen . Could the rest of us natural-born citizens swear to this ( see below) ? Just thought I'd throw it out there ( I watched < PROPFIRST>'s dad take the same oath , being that he is/was British ): 
( Courtesy of my Aunt Peggy ): Please copy and paste this to your status if you know someone , or have been affected by someone , who needs a smack upside the head . People who need a smack upside the head affect the lives of many . There is still no known cure for someone who deserves a smack upside the head , except a smack upside the head . . . but we can raise awareness . 
Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr . That SMACK ! upside the head would be far too kind for some people ( particularly a DVL ); seriously , is it SATC/jammy time with girlfriends yet ?! 
Tired . But , it's a good tired ! 
GO DR . OFFIT !!!!!! 
< PROPMALE > effin ' < PROPFIRST > ; FINALLY , off the DL and making his Mariners debut tonight . Gonna watch the game at friends ' ... can't wait . GO MARINERS !!! Beat the livin ' tar outta Texas :-) . 
The ' Mommy & Jack-Jack Movie Night ' movie ? \Kung Fu Panda . \ " AWESOMEness . " 
No , I didn't send anything to y'all . Just DELETE the stupid thing , if something shows up with my name on it ( thanks < PROPFIRST > , LOL ) . 
It's no ' Copacabana ' , but getting the Scorpions ' ' Rock You Like A Hurricane ' stuck in your head ain't much better ( WTF is wrong with me ?! LOL ) . 
For my dad . 
OMG ... now I'M craving dolma ; is this a sickness ?! ( thanks a lot , < PROPFIRST > , LOL ) . 
Who knows THIS song ( normally performed as an instrumental , without lyrics) ? :\ 
\ 
\First I held him lightly and we started to\ 
Thanks , all , for the well wishes , both here and through text , LOL . They helped make my Mother's Day great . < PROPFIRST > and I had a wonderful day with his best friend's family during what turned out to be a gorgeous day for a feast of a BBQ :-) . 
Soul sisters are the best . Thanks , < PROPFEMALE > . 
\Buildings with a hundred floors\ 
Charlotte : What kind of diet book are you looking for ? \ 
Miranda : I don't know . Something with a title like , ' How to Lose That Baby Fat by Sitting on Your Ass ' . 
< PROPFEMALE > [ talking about fussy baby , Brady ]: No , he's not sick . He's not hungry , he's not teething , he just wants to scream . I'm doing everything I can , but I can't please him . If he was 35 , this is when we would break up . 
* EXPLICIT * ( I'll put that warning up , but hey , this is \Sex and The City\ " as well as an adult's FB page ): \ 
Miranda : Smart ? Yes , and sometimes cute , but never ' sexy ' . Sexy is the thing I try to get them to see me as after I win them over with my personality . \ 
Carrie : You win men over with your personality ?? 
* EXPLICIT*\ 
Samantha : Is he that bad in bed ? \ 
Miranda : No , he's just ... he's a guy . He can rebuild a jet engine but when it comes to a woman ... what's the big mystery ?! It's my clitoris , not the Sphinx . 
( Props to my dear friend , < PROPFEMALE > , who posted this to her Wall last night and with whom I'm going to see \SATC 2\ " later today ): \ 
* EXPLICIT * ( well , sorta , but die-hard fans will be able to visualize this one ): \ 
Carrie : But ... this is a sex sprain . \ 
Stanford : Good for you ! \ 
Carrie : No , it was NOT good for me ! It was < PROPFIRST > rabbit sex ! You know , ' Pound!Pound!Pound!Pound!Pound!Pound!Pound!Pound!' . 
< PROPFEMALE > [ in voiceover ]: I got to thinking about relationships and lobotomies : two seemingly different ideas that just might be perfect together - like chocolate and peanut butter . 
Miranda : I said no white , no < PROPFIRST > , no nothing that says ' virgin ' . I have a child . The jig is up . 
Cab driver : No ! No smoking in cab ! \ 
Carrie : Sir , we're talking up-the-butt . A cigarette is in order . 
Remember ... and be grateful . 
Wherever you are at 3 p.m. today , Memorial Day , please pause for the National \ 
Moment of Remembrance . 
I dare anyone here to keep from laughing if/when their six-year-old describes , in graphic detail , walking up their dad's ( your ex's ) staircase and into his bedroom , only to let out a noisy bodily function on top of their basket full of clean laundry , just ' cause he was \annoyed with him\ " and didn't know what else he could do . \ 
< PROPMALE > dés sont sur < PROPFEMALE > tapis (\The dice are on the carpet \") \ 
SCENE : HS party drama across street , caught in mid-angst . \ 
Boy 1 : Ah , f*%k it , man ! \ 
Girl 1 [ peeks out ]: < PROPMALE > , you okay ?! \ 
< PROPMALE > [ walks faster ]: I'm fine . \ 
Boy 2 : Hey man , WAIT ! ( runs after < PROPMALE > )\ 
Girl 1 & Girl 2 [ hug ]: Which way did he go ? \ 
Boy 3 : Ahh , sh*t man , WAIT ! ( runs after < PROPMALE > & Boy 2)\ 
Girls at party : < tears > < hugs > He'll be OK , he's just upset < more hugs > \ 
Remember those days , y'all ?! Wish I'd had popcorn . ' night . 
* Happy Father's Day * to all the dads , step-dads and < PROPMALE > dads out there ! 
Happy first day of summer , everybody . It would be ever-so-nice if we were to actually get one here in the Northwest . 
A * HUGE * thank you goes out to < PROPFEMALE > Smullin , < PROPFIRST>'s intrepid and \ 
amazing kindergarten teacher , as well as < PROPFEMALE > Wickstrom , their student\ 
teacher from Seattle U , for giving so much of themselves to < PROPFIRST > and to\ 
all his classmates this year . I just received his final report card in \ 
the mail and it appears < PROPFIRST > will , indeed , move on to first grade in the\ 
fall ;-) . 
Okay , GO USA !! :-) 
Higher , Farther , Faster . Congratulations , Airman < PROPMALE > Kubaisee , on your graduation from AF Basic Training . From all of your friends at The List Project - this one , in particular - we are proud of your accomplishment ! Now go out and enjoy your first Independence Day in the States , < PROPMALE > and Heba ! 
Car problems . Grrrrrrrrrr ......... 
AND ... that was actually my comment , not < PROPFEMALE>'s , who happens to be here at my house , LOL . 
gets < PROPFIRST > back tomorrow evening :-) . Yay ! I miss him . 
Fingers and toes are requested to be crossed here , people . Altogether now ... ;-) . 
Thinking of < PROPFIRST > today . Thinking of a year ago . Counting my blessings and the people I've had crop up in my life during the past year , to include those who have come and seemingly , have gone - at least , for now . People appear for a reason . I am grateful for those reasons , whether or not I fully understand them . 
Spending the day with < PROPFIRST > and JJ , and SuperSoakers . Double-sigh ;-) . 
A beautiful day here , today ... 73 degrees and gorgeous ! ( who'd a thunk it just a couple of weeks ago , eh ? ) . 
Twelve days ' vacation with < PROPFIRST > begins today , which I'm happy about . But , heaven help my water < PROPMALE > with the SuperSoakers ! ;-) 
I'm organizing a group playdate with kids from < PROPFIRST>'s K class , so I ask him , \Want me to email Helina's mom ? \ " \ 
< PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > , my UWB friend and summer housemate , are running around playing SuperSoaker Army guys in my front and back yards . Those are some sweet , summer moments . 
Just saw ' How to Train Your Dragon ' with < PROPFIRST > at the Crest Theater here in Shoreline , only 3 bucks a ticket . It was a REALLY fun movie and I had not one , but two terrific dates - both < PROPFIRST > , and < PROPMALE > :-) . 
40-some-odd years and I had managed to avoid EVER taking up the coffee habit . One summer with < PROPFIRST > , and it's all shot to sh*t . Kill the boy ... ( but please , do leave me your French press when you head for < PROPFEMALE > !! ;-) 
If anyone out there is looking for young kids ' toys , clothes and assorted stuff and will be in the Shoreline area tomorrow , drop on by the yard sale I'm having with < PROPFIRST>'s best friend's mom , at their house , 9 am-3 pm : 334 NE 192nd St Shoreline ( street behind the soccer field and walking park ) . As you might imagine , we'll have LOTS of boys stuff on hand ! 
Just spent 45 minutes on the phone with an actually helpful and friendly Comcast internet guy , who helped me get my net back ( culprit ? Corrupted ethernet driver ) . Thanks , dude . 
T's Dichotomous Words of the Day : ' pompous ' and ' massage ' . Not linked in any way whatsoever , but both happen to be on my mind . 
Taking advantage of being sans-kid and watching me some grown-up TV ( with the volume turned up , no less ): ' Deadwood ' , Season Two . 
Anyone out there know someone who is studying techniques of deep tissue massage , a massage therapy student who will charge for less than the standard rate , for practice's sake ? Just get in touch with me . Thanks . 
is thinking of the 20th anniversary of Saddam's invasion of Kuwait ( 2 August 1990 ) , which set off a tsunami in my life and set the stage for much history to follow . I'm revisiting memories tonight , let alone , ironies . Am eternally grateful for my ex-husband , < PROPFIRST > , and his SF buddies , those who served and followed their call to duty , as well as my Iraqi friends , those who survived the inferno . I love you all very much . 
While admittedly a catchy tune , no one needs ' You Sexy Thing ' by Hot Chocolate stuck in their head . Suggestions for an alternative ? 
< PROPFIRST > and I are going down to visit with wonderful friends this afternoon , \I . I . \ " and his wife and two terrific kids . Life is pretty sweet . Wish my TLP buds could join us ! " 
Home again with < PROPFIRST > and best < PROPMALE > , JJ , for the day ... along with Hot Wheels and tracks running the length of my kitchen . I know that , one day , I'll look back nostalgically on all of this and smile , so I'm choosing to give in and just do that now . ' Vroom , vroom!' , boys , knock yourselves out ( and hey , don't mind the camera . I'm sure you'll appreciate these pics at your HS graduation party , he he ) . 
Ramadan Mubarak , my dear friends . You are each blessings in mine and < PROPFIRST>'s lives . 
is filling out her primary election ballot to mail in today , and wow ... we got some real loons running for Senator from Washington state , eh ? < PROPFEMALE > la Democracy ! 
Silently , the morning mist is lying on the water\ 
Captive moonlight , waiting for the dawn\ 
Softly , like a baby's breath , a breeze begins to whisper\ 
The sun is coming ... quick ! You must be gone\ 
Smiling like a superstar , the morning comes in singing\ 
The promise of another < PROPFEMALE > day\ 
And all the flowers open up to gather in the sunshine\ 
I do believe , the summer's here to stay ... \ 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ~ ' Summer ' ( 1972 ) 
Dear < PROPMALE > & < PROPFEMALE > (& Sassy ! ) from Kent : Please accept our sincere ' Thank You!' for giving us your well-tended , gorgeous campsite at White River Falls on Saturday morning . You saved our collective sanity , and perhaps even our lives , from the MethMob at Rednecks-R-Us . Sincerely , The CGs 
I miss the mountains :-( ... and the river , and the waterfall , and the tent , the sounds , the smells , the campfire , the CGs ( most especially ) and even , the mice . The redneck with the baby on a four-wheeler ? Not so much . But ... all the rest , I miss . Already looking forward to our trip next summer :-) . 
Wish I could accurately recount < PROPFIRST>'s rap he called ' Love ' . It tells the story of a couple who gets together , splits up , gets back together ( cuz they \still sorta like each other \") then decide to stay together . Hmmm ... \ 
Bon voyage , < PROPFIRST > . Take pics of Buenos Aires and post ' em , and STAY IN TOUCH WITH US !!! If you don't , I'll just send < PROPFIRST > down to stay with you until you wise up , LOL . xoxo ... 
EPL , great girlfriends , Chianti , bowls of pasta , the Spirit of < PROPFEMALE > and Ice Guy ; all in all , a pretty wonderful evening . Thanks , Universe . 
First Mommy and Jack-Jack Movie Night of First Grade features ' Mulan ' ( his request ! ) and vanilla bean ice cream with Hershey's syrup . Pretty nice Saturday night date , that :-) . 
and < PROPFIRST > are finally hosting another Dolma Day today . Wish we could have our dear Iraqi friends from around the country join us ! One day ... :-) . 
Eid Saeed ! 
is looking forward to seeing ( some of ) her DC20 peeps this evening . Aaahhhh ... we'll miss all those who can't be there ! \ 
One shout-out in particular must go to Liam ' So you're saying they ASKED to be water-boarded ?! ' Mcgivern on this , the 2nd Anniversary of his veritably sucking the air out of a Pentagon conference room ;-) . 
Remember . 
TOUCHDOWN , SEAHAWKS !! They lead the 49ers 28-6 in the 3rd . After such a disappointing baseball season , I'll take it . 
GO DAWGS !!! CREAM THE HUSKERS ! ( I do so enjoy this matchup , when it happens ) 
Thinking of you tonight , Osama , my dear friend . Best of luck ... best of EVERYTHING , of thoughts , of prayers , of everything I have to send to you tonight . You are someone whom I am so remarkably proud to call ' friend ' in this life . \ 
Go kick ass in the Army , babe . Go and be everything you came here to be . I BELIEVE IN YOU . 
Tower of Power live = all kinds of AWESOME . Seeing ToP with friends = PRICELESS . Thanks again , < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > !! 
is excited about facilitating the < PROPMALE > project for < PROPFIRST>'s class today ! We're beginning an < PROPMALE > exchange with some of the Iraqi kids who are helped by < PROPFEMALE > Crow's Collateral Repair Project in Amman , < PROPFIRST > . While I can't post pics of kids , I'll see what I can do about getting a few of their drawings . Looking forward to seeing what < PROPFIRST>'s classmates come up with to represent ' home'! :-) 
HUSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSKIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSS !!!!!!!! 
G-DAMMIT ... sometimes , I hate this effing work with TLP ; my hands are SO tied , and they can feel so completely useless . \ 
May God please Bless the beautiful , peaceful , freedom-loving people of the land known as Iraq . May I be of some small use to them in their determination to know , finally , some amount of peace ... and < PROPFEMALE > ... and freedom . Amen . 
I like it on the windowsill next to my front door . 
{ Thanks , < PROPFEMALE > . ? you , girl !! ]\ 
Every single one of you are on my friend list , as a result of a conscious decision . I wanted you there ! I am not only glad to count you as friends , but also family . Let's see who on my friends list actually pays attention . Copy & paste this as your status . I'll be watching ... to see who really does < PROPFEMALE > family & friendship . Thank you for being part of my life . 
Looking forward to attending the WAPTA Legislative Assembly over the next couple of days . Maybe I'll learn a little about just what the heck it is I'm supposed to be doing , eh ? Always preferable . 
is tired , has had her brain packed full of leg stuff , yet feels jazzed , all the same . 
Best of everything to the Chilean miners . Go live the rest of your lives and tell the world's media to eff off for a while . 
Best of luck today to the San < PROPFIRST > Giants in Game 1 of the NLCS , and to my friend < PROPFEMALE>'s nephew , < PROPMALE > ... who just happens to be taking the mound today :-) . \

I'm thinking about < PROPMALE > Niehaus , wishing we could have gone to the fan remembrance , but deciding that there should be a salami on rye with mustard in my near future ... 
My next-door neighbor has his Christmas lights up , five days before Thanksgiving ; the worst part is , he won't take ' em down until < PROPFIRST>'s Day . I've traditionally loved the holiday season , but that's just wrong .

Oh , for < PROPMALE>'s sake , Shoreline Schools , get your act together ! Normally , you close the district when the mercury dips below 35 and there's a whiff of a flurry in the air ; I'm lookin ' at nothing but white . Could you please announce your decision so I can plan my dang day ?! 
just found out that < PROPMALE>'s Drive-In is going to build their new location on Hwy . 99 in Edmonds , about a 5 minute drive from my house . YAY !! and , uh-oh . Discipline , Trace , discipline ...
