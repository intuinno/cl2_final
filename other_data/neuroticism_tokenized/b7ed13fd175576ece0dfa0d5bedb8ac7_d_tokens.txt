I have renewed love for Mass Effect 2 after just playing Mass Effect 1 . Oh MAKO , how I do not miss thee at all . 
in winter mood . gimme snow !! 
has discovered the secret to non cat pee smelling carpet ! 
Facebook just told me that < PROPFEMALE > palin has 1,959,909 fans . my faith in humanity has just dwindled a little . 
TWILIGHT KILLS PEOPLE !!!! :O 
I feel completely and utterly uninspired . 
has serious unresolved issues 
I thought a thought . That thought became an idea . That idea became a reality . Hence , thought = reality . Right ? Well , it made sense at the time . 
tired of seeing naked chicks on the front < PROPFEMALE > of dA ... >_> \ 
why can't it be naked guys for a change ? huh ? 
I am highly concerned . My cat has not come home in over a day . \ 
I DON'T WANT HER TO DIE !!!!! TT A TT 
anyone got a copy of fable 2 they're willing to let me borrow ? 
life isn't about winning or losing . it's about knowing when to cut your losses and move on . only the strongest survive . 
something something something dark side ... \ 
something something something .. complete . 
Do you believe in magic ? 
stuck in a writer's block >_< 
i have two new fish . their names are Wrex who is a giant black goldfish and Kasumi who is a small black goldfish\

they are awesome :D 
I have spent the entirety of the previous night forging swords . From now on , I shall be known as Master Blacksmith !! \

I have come to conclude that Sparrow from Fable 2 is Shepard's [ Mass Effect ] ancestor 
i have successfully turned all gay men in bowerston town straight .... poor < PROPMALE > . 
Gambling . It's an addiction . 
Renaming one of my fish Sushi . Unoriginal ? Yes . Funny ? Definitely . 
Vampires Suck was awesome !! \ 
Thanks , < PROPFEMALE > ! ^^ 
anyone interested in a 5 gal fish/reptile tank ? 
What is this world coming to ? \ 
Too much hate going around . \ 
Whatever happened to being friends and talking shit out ?? \ 
We're not kids anymore to be talking crap about people behind their backs . \ 
Or being mad over trivial things . \ 
Bake a pie . \ 
Share some cookies or something . \ 
For the love of all that's holy , kiss and make up ! \ 
Wake up ! \ 
Life isn't forever . 
My personal opinion BioWare converting Mass Effect 2 to PS3 : I honestly think it's a waste of time and effort if they're not going to do the same for ME1 . Without ME1 , it takes away from the whole experience of the mass effect games , the impact your decisions make from game 1 to game 2 . 
CURSE YOU , WOMANHOOD !!!!! D:<

Very curious and very smart\ 
Doesn't mind being around humans but would prefer not to be touched 
putting my creativity to use ^^\ 
holidays are coming up\

it's decorating time ! \

Raiding Kalani's iTunes folder :D

I have Wrex's approval . My life is now complete <3 
HOLYCRAPLIARAISSOFREAKINAWESOMEFAS ;D OIFAJ ;D F 1 !!!!!!

You humans are all racist ! 
Cup Noodles ? \ 
More like\ 
Cup Heaven ! 
Suffering from vertigo . \ 
Fun stuff .... =_=; 
I'm very disillusioned by what vampires have become . Whatever happened to standards , people ? And no , sparkling does not , in any way , make you a vampire . It makes you a < PROPFEMALE > . 
Exactly what part of wrestling is science fiction ? None ! \ 
Come on , SyFy , you're better than that ! 
I am not amused by my lack of tiredness right now .... =_=;

Loving the weather outside !! :D 
Just finished watching V for Vendetta . A true classic . Makes me wonder , though . How close are we really to that reality ? 
Sometimes , it becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish dreams from reality . 
In your opinion , which < PROPFEMALE > wars movie was the best ? 
Woke up from the weirdest dream ever about someone I haven't seen or heard from in over 5 years . 
We are creatures of habit , are we not 
The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo ............ crazy movie !! 
Because Jamul hates me , I hate Jamul . \ 
Damn you , Jamul , and your cat stealing ways !! \ 
May you burn to less than ashes !!!! 
Copy\ 
and paste this to your status if you know someone or have been affected\ 
by someone who needs a punch in the face . People who need a punch in \ 
the face affect the lives of many . There is still no known cure for \ 
someone who deserves a punch in the face , except for a punch in the \

Saw < PROPMALE > Horror . Catchy tunes ... but not the best musical I have seen . \ 
Perhaps better experienced live . 
\Uh ... negative .. I am a meat popsicle \"" 
Dragon Age really isn't that bad ... Gave it another shot and have realized that being a mage is pretty freakin ' fun 
HOLY FREAKIN ' CRAP !!!! BROODMOTHER !!!! :O 
Having made the ultimate sacrifice , I actually almost started crying at the end of Dragon Age .... 
I hate to love and love to hate BioWare . \ 
But I cannot complain as they own my soul . 
pre ordered dragon age 2 !! \ 
if you want the special edition for the price of the regular edition , do it before december !! 
One day , I think I'm gonna snap and then bad things will happen . \ 
gods save us all . 
Based on what I've read so far , Assassin's Creed : Brotherhood is looking to be a pretty damn exciting game ! 
AC : B = Pure awesomeness !!! 
FFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUU !!!!! D:< 
Cold weather and gaming do not go well together\ 
no sir they don't 
Had the weirdest dream ever . \ 
Well , not ever , but it was still weird .

i'm happy ^^ 
Just came back from seeing Tangled . \ 
It was actually good ! 
when I get paid next , i'm so buying a better nonstick pan and hiding it in my room !!! D:< \ 
How am I supposed to make crepes when all the pans we have SUCK !!!!!! 
ending to assassin's creed : brotherhood = WHOA !!! \ 
another game I can't wait til they come out with a sequel 
is it weird that i just sprouted another birthmark on my face ? 
Registered for classes ! woot ! :D

Narnia : Voyage of the < PROPFEMALE > Treader = a good and enjoyable movie once you get past the ' hold your hands and sing for jesus ' part . 
managed to snag the last bag of mint m&m's at target today ! \ 
those are ridiculously hard to find ! 
had a lot of fun at < PROPFEMALE>'s eating food , making cookies , and watching guys play play station move games 
totally had a < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > moment tonight ... \ 
now i feel sort of bad 
\To be a man\ 
Life is like a cheap B-movie remake with a bad title . 
if i no longer appear on your friend list , it is because facebook blocked me due to name change . \ 
it cannot handle the awesomeness of < PROPFIRST > izzard . 
Shepard [ while driving the MAKO ]: Can't ... get ... the ... f'ing ... resource DAMN I'LL KILL EVERYONE !! \ 
yes . there's an < PROPFIRST > izzard moment for everything . 
Jamul : Where pets go to die . 
SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM !!! 
< PROPFIRST > Izzard catch phrases should be made into memes\ 
ie\ 
the barbecue ! for my movie \The Barbecue ! \ " \ 
I'm wondering ... would any one be interested in having a game night ? \ 
No , I'm not talking about video games . I'm taking about board games and such . \ 
Food , drink , and fun ? 
The Good Guys = funniest cop show ever !! 
tired , stressed , and a bit depressed . \ 
i could write a poem about that . \ 
too bad no one would buy it . 
living off peanuts and ramen . \ 
i long for a grapefruit ! 
what the hell is going on , california !?!? it's the middle of january and it's 88 * degrees outside ! I want my winter back ! 
my verdict on Mass Effect PS3 version : if you have a good PC or a 360 , go with that . PC preferably . The PS3 version is just not as personal . Yes , the graphics are amazing , but they are also great on the PC . Plus , with the PC and the 360 , you get to choose your back story a little more . The comic on the PS3 is not even close to doing the game any justice . 
Could not have picked a better time to take a creative writing class at Cuyamaca . Seriously looking forward to this semester :D 
had a lot of fun today ^^ 
if you love < PROPFIRST > Reynolds , you should watch Chaos Theory . \ 
Honestly , I'd say it's his best performance as far as I've seen . 
first quiz of the semester = 100%\ 
on poetry , no less . 
British romantic comedy is simply the best ! 
Well , the word is in . \ 
If you watched today's Colbert Report , you probably heard about the world's shortage of gamers and gaming hours logged . Currently , we are at 3 billion hours/week . Our goal ? 21 billion hours/week . \ 
So , start gaming and make the world a better place ! 
had a fun time today at tea n more with everyone ^^ 
My professor of British Literature believes that Dress To Kill is the best stand up comedy in the world . Ever . I knew this was going to be the best class . 
I have a whole new level of respect for Mr. Diva 51 
HELP ! I'M ADDICTED TO COOKIES !! 
just saw a horrific car accident on the 94 between a small car and a huge semi . Considering the car's and the truck's condition , I am STILL amazed the guy was alive and I am VERY glad he didn't have any passengers because if he did , there would have been nothing left of them . 
Rearranged our room today . I feel soooo much better ! 
Today , someone in London tried to access my facebook account . Apparently , they failed . 
omg i want a cat !! \

Never open an account with Wells Fargo . They screw you over five ways to Sunday . 
Made cookies today . \ 
Chocolate chocolate chip cookies and < PROPFEMALE > shaped , double layered with strawberry jam and topped with nuts sugar cookies . pics might follow 
totally enjoying RIFT right now . 
Life lessons I've learned so far :\ 
-Never live in AZ . \ 
-Never bank with Wells Fargo . \ 
-Never trust someone's word , even if it's family . Find out for yourself . \ 
-Cash your checks at WalMart . \ 
-Shop at Ralphs . 
Made lemonade in the middle of winter . \ 
Weird ? \ 
I say trendy . \ 
Go make lemonade ! \ 
Nao !

A real woman always keeps her house clean and organized , the laundry basket is always empty . She's always well dressed , hair done . She never swears , behaves gracefully in all situations and all circumstances . She has more than enough < PROPFEMALE > to take care of her family , always has a smile on her lips , and a kind word for everyone . Post this as your status if you , too , suspect that you might be a man . 
i want a shirt with a cartoonish smiling zombie on the front wearing a suit and with thumbs up . yep . yoomin , next time i am paid , i am so commissioning you to draw that for me .
