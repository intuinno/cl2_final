Looking forward to my Holiday coming up soon . Not sure whether to be happy about going to < PROPFIRST > afterwards . 

Just finished a week's holidaty in England - restful but wet ( the holiday not me ) . Will be off to < PROPFIRST > soon . 
We just bought a new puppy ! 
Just arrived in Yokohama . Lovely hotel but I'm afraid to use the toilet - it has too many buttons ! 
< PROPMALE > is considering dog shows . 
I am getting ready for my first two real dog shows . ( Oh and Christmas too ) 
< PROPMALE > is in < PROPFIRST > , Texas . He wishes < PROPFEMALE > hadn't put their logo on top of this \city\ " on the map so it took an extra 2 hours to find ! \
