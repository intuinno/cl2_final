Dear Lord , So far today I am doing alright . I have not gossiped , lost my temper , been grumpy or self-indulgent . I have not whined , complained , cursed or eaten any chocolate . I have charged nothing on my credit card . But I will be getting out of bed in a minute , and I think that I will really need your help then .

Today I will live in the moment . Unless the moment is unpleasant , in which case I will eat a cookie . 
SO many people I know are going through heartache right now . I wish that I could help them all , fix it for them , take away their pain . If you are hurting , find someone to < PROPFEMALE > on .

?????????????????????????? \ 
?????????????????????????? 
Rough day . 
Playing the underdog is one of the great motivating roles as teams enter a big game , and the Steelers have the luxury of leaning on it next Sunday . < PROPFIRST > Tomlin , one of the master motivators in the NFL , will never cause any waves publicly , but he's likely using the snub to his advantage for the most successful franchise in the Super Bowl < PROPFEMALE > . 
How many Steeler fans does it take to change a light bulb ? One , because they think if they simply hold onto the bulb the world will revolve around them . 
Two Steelers walk PAST a bar . Hey , it could happen . 
My coworkers went to Cheeburger Cheeburger and all I got was this lousy salad ... LOL Watching what you eat is NO FUN ! 
OK .... just 3 hours to the BIG GAME - c'mon team you can do this !!! I am SO EXCITED ! 
What a great game , penalties and turnovers cost us dearly , but it was another exciting Superbowl ! Congrats to the Packers !

What a wonderful weekend with my daughter in Tampa at The Florida Aquarium ! Love you < PROPFEMALE > ! xoxo 
Just wanted to say a BIG THANK YOU to all of the friends and family who came out and made my 40th . Birthday party such a wonderful time and a huge success ! You guys are the best friends and family anyone could ask for and I was overwhelmed by the support of everyone coming out to party with me ! Thank you ALL for making it a most memorable one ! 
Ok so , someone must be watching out for me .... I came in to work after being off yesterday and wondered why there was white chalky stuff all over my desk ? I was told that the entire light fixture DIRECTLY above my head suddenly smashed down landing right on top of my desk and chair , exactly where I would have been sitting ..... and this thing is about 5 foot long , sharp metal and VERY HEAVY . Thank you God !

To my children , I make mistakes , sometime more than I like to admit . But , I'll always be there for you . To hear you , to cheer you , to laugh or cry with you , to protect you with my life , and to love you for eternity with all my heart no matter what . No one will ever love you more than I do . 
Ok , I have NEVER been a doomsday-er . But watching the footage of the earthquake , the tsunami .... I can't help but think , too much is happening too fast . And can't help but wonder if this wonderful planet is going to be here for our kids kids . Mother nature is pissed ......
