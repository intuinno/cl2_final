In the case of Mind vs . Matter , Matter won . 
“Even though we've changed and we're all finding our own place in the world , we all know that when the tears fall or the smile spreads across our face , we'll come to each other because no matter where this crazy world takes us , nothing will ever change so much to the point where we're not all still friends . ” 
\Success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has overcome while trying to succeed . \ " - < PROPMALE > T . Washington " 
Without struggle , there is no progress . \ - < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > " 
The workings of the human heart are the profoundest mystery of the universe . One moment they make us despair of our kind , and the next we see in them the reflection of the divine image . \ - < PROPFIRST > W . Chesnutt " 
“Peace is possible around the world , and children are the answer . ” - < PROPMALE > Jones 
\The question is not whether we can afford to invest in every child ; it is whether we can afford not to . \ " - < PROPFEMALE > Wright Edelman " 
\I can accept failure . Everyone fails at something . But I can't accept not trying . \ " - < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > " 
“A word to the wise ain't necessary , it's the stupid ones who need the advice . ” - < PROPMALE > Cosby 
\Getting to the point where the other is not the enemy is a big leap . \ " - < PROPMALE > Crouch "
