Wish I could be en mi iglesia spending the new year . I miss ya'll . Happy New Years everybody !! :] 

Seven times u fall nd seven times I'll raise u up * Proverbs 24:16 * 
I seen him holding me nd I nver wnted him 2 let go 
My pledge is to never ever be ashamed of Jesus . I will not be afraid , I will not be ashamed , this is my life . 
The more I get closer to God , the more the devil tries to knock me down , but he will not win this time ... I will be victorious 
Don't give up because your reward will come 2 Chronicles 15:7 
God hears even the smallest voice 
There's no time to waste blowing off ur commitment to the Lord . Ask yourself , \Do I want to be doing [ this activity ] when Jesus comes back ? \ " If not change ur course " 
I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me . * Philippians 4:13 * 
Chances are , you won't get everything you want in life . But you can count on God to provide everything you Need . 
God WILL make a way , when there seems to be NO way . 
The worst thing about being lied to is knowing u weren't worth the truth 
Porque a mi 
Happy moments , Praise God .. Difficult moments , Seek God .. Quiet moments , Worship God .. Painful moments , Trust God ..... Every moment , Thank God 
Where there is no wood , the fire goes out 
Let your hope make u glad . Be patient in time of trouble and never stop praying . * Romans 12:12 * 
There is Someone who fully knows whats in our hearts . Nd knowing , He never laughs mockingly nd fades away . He never shrugs nd walks away . Instead He understands completely nd stays near . Who indeed knows ? Our God alone knows . He sympathizes with our weaknesses nd forgives our transgressions . To Him there are no secret struggles or silent cries . He hears . He sees . He stays near 
People need loving the most when they deserve it the least

Have faith in God ! If you have faith in God and don't doubt , you can tell this mountain to get up and jump into the sea , and it will . Everything you ask for in prayer will be yours , if only you have faith . * < PROPFIRST > 11:23 -24 *

Ugh i just wnna be able to sleep for one night without wakin up throughout . I hate being sick \[" 
At my breaking point .... 
Always searching and searching for something that i just can't find .... 
Sometimes people put up walls .. Not to keep others out .. But to see who cares enough to break them down 
Darn you fb games . ! * shakin my fist in the air * 
Don't give up on me ... I promise I'm worth it 
Creator only You take brokenness \ 
And create it into beauty once again
