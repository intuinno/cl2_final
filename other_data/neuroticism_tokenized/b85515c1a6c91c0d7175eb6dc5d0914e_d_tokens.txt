Sleepy ... must go to bed .... Night all . ^_^ 
Ok . That paper is due on tuesday now so ... yeah .... busy busy . getting ready for my next class ... which is honestly probably a waste of time . 
... Reasons why I hate spring break ... 1 . There is free time ... too much free time ... so much that it really doesn't exist . 2 . HOMEWORK ... 3 . Work+Papers to write+boyfriend = Procrastination ! 4 . Everyone else is also on break and demanding I spend time with them 5 . EVERYTHING happens of break ... to the point that I can get nothing done !!!! ( Oh and Happy Birthday Lexi !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ^^) 
Long night .... going to be a short sleep and then another long morning ! So Happy I have the next two days off ... 
Is worried about her classes ... I guess I need to take more than full time ... 
Anyone interested in a ticket to the Tulsa 66ers Basketball game On April 3 ? 
is tired . / . / but doesn't want to sleep ... Is missing her cuddle < PROPMALE > ... T.T 
R . I . P < PROPFEMALE > (<PROPFEMALE>'s hamster ) . You will be missed 
It is tuesday ... Off to school . I feel like I'm still asleep ... T.T grrr .. 
Is having a pretty good day . Missing her Cougar very much right now ... 
Isn't this weather nice ! I love Thunder Showers . ^^ 
Off to work ... Fun . 
That was a very interesting prom . 
Feeling icky 
Off to work . Fun Fun . I get to do Drive thru tonight (@ Braums ) ! WHOOT !!!! ^ ^ is very happy she didn't die last night .

RIP Aunt < PROPFIRST > . You will be missed . T.T 
Having an ok day ... Missing my Cougar .... 
... still irritated at kassi , I wasn't even mad until he started cussing at me ... But whatever ... its the < PROPMALE > thing all over again and this time if she decides that Her friends take a back seat to her lover she is going to risk losing them . I don't mess around with this stuff and I don't < PROPFEMALE > around when I'm not wanted . I guess since she has him now her life is perfect and she doesn't need us anymore ... 
While you SCREAM at your woman , there's aman wishing he could whisper softly in her ear ... While youHUMILIATE , OFFEND & INSULT her , there's a man flirting with her & reminding her how wonderful she is . While you HURT your woman , there's a man wishing he could make love to her . While you make yourwoman CRY there's a man stealing smiles from her !! Post this on yourwall if you're against Domestic Abuse . 
2 in the morning ... I need to start going to bed as soon as I get off work ... My body is so tired but my mind is racing ... 
Well I'm about ready to start my own sitcom ... I mean who\ 
knew that Braum’s would be so full of drama anyway ... ( Guess that is just because\ 
Nowata’s Drama-itis is contagious ) 
Is getting over being sick ... why me ? I finally got off work and I get sick ... figures ... 
Went to the doctor . Got a note for work and some meds . He thinks its either an infection or allergies + a bug . Feeling a little better , still coughing out my lungs and my tummy is at war with me but I should be better soon with the help of the meds . 
Feeling better , still coughing alot but its bareable now . 
... so yeah ... tired ... working tomorrow ... Fun ... 
? ~ When life gives you lemons .... Squeeze them into open wounds ~ ? 
work today ... Fun stuff . ^ ^ 
Home now , mom got sick so I had to leave early . She is resting now , it is either a bug or she ate something bad . Looks like the worst is over tho .

Now it is getting closer to time to work ... can't wait til my day off . 
Home . Tired . Irritated . But then again whats new ? Looking forward to wednesday , it will be nice to have a day off . \ 
Pondering how there are so many idiots in such a small area , or is it really a lot of idiots over the entire world .

I work tomorrow ... Fridays are always fun at Braums ... ^ ^ 
About to go out with cougar . Tonights gonna be a good night !!!!! ^^ 
I am tired of trying to figure things out so I'm just going to let go . Thinking can cause you to doubt things that you have no right to doubt .... 
One Day ... 
Whoot !!! It's my birthday . ^^ 
Wants to thank everyone for the birthday wishes . ^_^ Now where's my presents ? ( J/K ) 
I enrolled today . Whoot for college !

Head-aches are no fun . Wish I knew why they plague me at night . I took some meds and it is starting to go away ... just a little . 
I just got SKYPE on my Computer . ^ ^ 
I'm testing out My Aol Lifestream ... 
Test ? 
Just got back from the mall . Toy Story 3 Was Awesome ! ^_^ If you haven't seen it you should . The mini cartoon before it ( Day&Night ) was pretty good too . 
Got a date with Cougar tonight . ^ ^ Fun Fun ... 
Wondering why everything goes the way it does ...

who comments on this i will have their last name for the nexr two\ 
days .. i dare you to post this as you status too ! 
Happy Fathers Day Everyone !!!! 
I love you !!! ^^ 
Thinking about saving up for future things ... and wondering why they make it so hard to get started on your own ... 
Here is some food for thought . You have a sister who you love , who you do things with and buy things for . And what do you get in return . HATE . Why do I try . I try to comfort her and she pushes me away . I offer to do things with her she wants to do and she shoots me down . I watch a sad movie about losing your sister/brother and I go to hug her and she shuns me . I give up . 
~ * His Girl * ~ 
~ Long night .... * Yawn * 
^ ^ Good Day . 
Tired ... Must sleep now ... 
Having lunch with < PROPFEMALE > , my sis and cousin . Going to go watch some LARPing later ...

Tired . Stressed . Irritated . But hey thats life and it doesn't get any better . 
Ready for classes to start ! 
Wish I knew what my life held for me , what is my purpose ... why am I here ? If I had never been born would the world really be that different ? ( Simple contemplation , not upset or anything ^ ^) 
Feeling better today ! ^ ^ A little more motivated than I have been . I really can't wait till classes start . I can go buy my books next week and the week after that is classes !! SO HAPPY ! ( I know , everyone thinks I'm wierd cause I love school , but I'm happiest when I'm learning and school gives my life structure and I really need that right now . ) 
Guess it is back to work for me . ^_^ Hope they have the AC fixed cause working at Braum's with no AC is terrible . No one wants to play beat the clock to eat their ice cream before it melts ... 
Well today was good . We got all the freezers fixed a few days ago so I was able to stock tonight . There are two whole empty shelves in the back . \ 
Looking forward to spending tomorrow with Cougar Mader . ^ ^ he is going to educate me in the way of the gamer ( his way at least . ) Besides that I miss him and think it is about time that we < PROPMALE > out together . \

TIRED !!!! 
I connected my Facebook account to my SparkPeople account . You too can join for free at http://www.sparkpeople.com ! 
Tired , hungry , and I have a head ache .... 
Boys suck . Also they need to make a class called \dating 101\ " and offer it in high school and college so events that happen in dating wouldn't be so confusing ( it would supplement sex < PROPMALE > very nicely ) . " 
Ready for times to get better ... ^ ^ 
Ready to run ! 
I have decided that while I keep trudging through this mundane existence , working my ass off trying to get to where I want to be , that ultimately I should not waste my energy on caring . 
èToday is getting better . On my break right now . Wont get home till like 11 but im feeling pretty good right now ... Still shaking off those feelings of be 
èing left behind . 
Proverbs 14:13 Even in laughter the heart may ache , and joy may end in grief . 
Needs wide open spaces ... 
Is trying to sort out life ... starting with all of this stinking homework ... 
Is ready for the weekend and all the serious studying she needs to do ... also can't wait to spend time with Cougar Mader 
Really starting to rethink this whole 16 credit hours thing ... 5 classes ( one of which is online ) is already starting to bug me .... Oh well getting things done anyway . ^ ^

Is TOTALLY ready for the fall/winter season . ~ Other than the stupid removal of wisdom scheduled for Dec 13 ... ~ 
Is ready for everything to fall into place ... and for mid-terms to be over already !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Wishes life had background music ... it would make the day go better ... 
I guess I need a sign that says \Study mode : Warning Bitch in action\ " or something cause for some reason me reading an writing frantically before a class and/or getting upset over a grade doesn't seem to be registering to some people ... " 
Pretty sure I failed that exam . ... Why is that professor so evil ? Did someone spit in his food or something ?? Gesh get over it and be nice !!!!!! 
Getting around to go to the safety meeting . Really dont like getting up this early ... Oh well . 
Happy Hump day EVERYONE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ^_^ 
What's on my mind ... How hungry I am and how this diet book makes me never want to eat again . 
Well work tonight ... got some things accomplished today tho . I have now almost finished the PP for my speech and the piano is now in my room and I have successfully emptied one box ( Now to empty the rest , clear off my desk and clean off the bed .. guess I'm sleeping on the couch tonight ) . 
Wow has braums been busy tonight !

Is reminding her self to have < PROPFEMALE > ... even if she is almost out of it . 
Love\ 
is patient , love is kind . It does not envy , it does not boast , it is\ 
not proud . It is not rude , it is not self-seeking , it is not easily\ 
angered , it keeps no record of wrongs . Love does not delight in evil\ 
but rejoices with the truth . It always protects , always trusts , always\ 
hopes , always perseveres . ( I Corinthians 13 : 4-7 ) . [ guess i'll just repeat it over and over again ... ]

days before that too . I think of you in silence , I often speak your \ 
name . All I have are memories and a picture in a frame . Your memory is \ 
a ... keepsake from which I'll never part . God has you in His arms . I \ 
have you in my heart . Re-post if you love someone in heaven

Sister : The person who knows who I am . Knows all my hardships and shares my joys . The one who makes me laugh and makes me cry . She means the world to me but rarely knows this . So today I tell the world how I love my lil sis !

You are a gift and are more precious than words can say . \ 
Love you baby girl you are the most wonderful sister in the universe . 
Looks like it will be a pretty good day today . ^^ 
Why does everyone want to come to braums at once ? \ 
I think I will eat something and then fall into bed , Church in the morning and work at 4 ... fun fun fun .... Well Just though I would let everyone know that I LOVE them . ^ ^ Peoples have been on my mind today . ( Also hoping that < PROPFEMALE > is doing even better ) . 
Okay , If it is going to be this cold there had better be snow ... and I mean soon like late monday night ... 
He who finds a wife finds what is good and receives favor from the lord . Proverbs 18:22 
Really fell sick right now . I'm so not looking forward to tomorrow ... :'( 
Well I go in for my Oral Surgery at 8 this morning . Doubt that I will be back on here today ... Scared out of my wits and really just wishing this was over . :'( 
Well I'm awake now . Starting to feel the pain . This stupid gauze is driving me crazy I'll be glad when the bleeding stops . 
Okay . Think I'm done with the gauze . On the other hand my mouth hurts and I have another hour till I can take more pain meds ... I miss my wisdom already ... :'( 
Well still feeling bad today . Nauseas and tired . Plus it feels like someone punched me in both jaws . At least i was able to eat a small something today ( about half a scrambled egg and 1/4 of a cup of jello ) . yesterday i went 25 hours with nothing but water ( Followed by 1/4 cup of jello ) . I will be glad when I can eat reall food again . 
I don't feel so good ... 
I ate some more scrambled eggs so I'm not quite so shaky now . Still in pain ( It is an annoying kind of pain , like I got hit in the face ) but popping the pills again so that should fade away . 
Well woke up this morning and the left side felt like my jaw was gonna fall off . Got some pain meds in me now so I'm starting to feel better . Had < PROPMALE > n ' Cheese for breakfast and let me tell you it was a nice change from eggs and jello . 
Feeling a bit better , mostly just tired from the pain meds and upset tummy . At least the pain meds are keeping my mouth pain to a minimum . 
Everything is feeling better now except that one side . Just a little longer and I can take more pain meds ... 
Went back to the oral surgeon this morning . He says everything looks fine and that the pain I'm having is normal . So now I just need to eat something . I've lost 7lbs since the procedure of Monday ... 
Okay . I'm so tired . It is amazing how much energy your body uses when it is healing ... Mom is trying to remind me to eat more ... I keep getting upset stomach and she claims its from not eating enough with my meds . She is probably right , but I still don't enjoy eating right now . 
Wish I was on the top of someones list instead of second or third like It appears I have been . So ready for life to get better . 
Peppermint hot chocolate . Now that is comfort food . \ 
~ over looked ~ 
Starbucks plus a good friend equals a very content me . \ 
So glad pasta is a soft food . It taste so good . \ 
Okay , I think I ate to much ... I haven't had much to eat the last 4 days and eating all that pasta has made me light headed ... 
Going to walmart to do some shopping . ^^\ 
~ tired ~ 
Well did most of my shopping today . I have a few things left to get but I'm almost done . Not looking forward to Monday but that is life ... 
Should not have take that pain pill before church . Cant keep my eyes open ... \ 
Waiting on people can get old after about 5 hours . ^^\ 
Feeling like crap right now . Physically and emotionally exhausted . Trying to eat some comfort food even tho it is killing my mouth to do so ... If I don't I'm gonna break ... 
Its sad but I'm already ready for classes to start back up again . I don't know why but this year Christmas just isn't going very well ... 
Ok . Here we go . Out with the stitches ... \ 
About to finish present wrapping . All that is left is < PROPFEMALE>'s gifts and buying stocking stuffers and A gift for < PROPFEMALE > ... 
Emptiness ... What more can I say ? 
Starting to think I'm suffering from depression ... I'm feel so empty . 
Well I have been informed that the pain meds I took for my oral surgery are also narcotics that cause depression . So while I now know why I feel this way I can't un-feel it . 
Actually looking forward to work tonight . It will give me a < PROPMALE > to not think . Starting to rethink everything . Its amazing how invisible I can be until something goes wrong ... 
... 
Having a rough night , really tired of people . Really thankful to < PROPFEMALE > for her support today ( its nice to know I'm not the only one that goes through this stuff ) . Still not happy with quite a few people but you know what I really don't care about it anymore . We will just see what happens tomorrow ... 
I hate it when my mind is so busy i cant sleep . Im soooo tired . :-( \ 
Well maybe there is a little light in this darkness . We shall see how today goes . 
Well today is looking really good right now . ^ ^ 
I love him so much . So glad he can listen and understand while others just get angry . 
Well it is supposed to be Christmas < PROPFEMALE > , how < PROPFEMALE > r do to lack of snow I think we ought to go on strike and cancel it . ^ ^ 
Starting to think christmas is a joke . \ 
~ TFR ~ 
Its funny . They call this part of the profile the wall . If it really was a wall there wouldnt be anything written here . \ 
Very much tired ... 
Hoping that tomorrow is better than today . It should be I'm off work , but who knows at this point . 
Is trying to figure out last minute details for the party !! 
Looking forward to seeing my baby ! ^ ^ 
Hangin at the mall with my handsome . ^^\ 
Yawn ... Dont know if ill make it to midnight . \ 
Is missing my handsome ... 
? Love , that achy feeling in your chest when they are not around . That tug pulling you to them . That thought bringing them into your mind . That pain that never dies . That sorrow that never lessons . Real love can heal you , Real love can shatter you to bits . ? 
Well this is going to be a fun day ... cleaning cleaning oh and more cleaning . ^ ^ 
Spending time with my lil sis and lovin it !? 
Missing my Hero . Can't wait till tomorrow ! I love ya handsome ! 
? 
We are just like animals in a zoo . The only difference is we can't see the bars . 
\ah gravity . Thou < PROPMALE > a he < PROPMALE > less bitch . \ " < PROPMALE > from the big bang theory\ 
Wondering what a life with structure feels like ... 
Really not happy right now . I'm calmer now , but still pissed off . I will be glad when Friday gets here , I won't be so stressed once I get my books ( Not having them is driving me crazy ) 
Well got up without feeling tired . Did a little yoga and practice some Bollywood dance moves . Feeling much better this morning and actually feel like I'm ready for work . Going in a lil early to eat breakfast and hopefully I'll get off by about 5 . Whoot whoot ! and Then I will visit my sis since she is sick ( tonsillitis ) 
Alright a total of 8lbs lost . I know not that great but that means I only have 12 more to meet my goal for the next 6 months ( as long as I can keep it off ) So I guess some good came out of my teeth being removed ... It jump started the fact that I don't need to eat like I used to . 
Today has been the most productive this week it feels like . Going to get my books tomorrow !!! It will be so nice to have that out of the way . I hope I feel this good tomorrow too . ^ ^

~ Magan Hughes ( 1/6/11 ) 
What would it take to heal your heart ? \ 
How can it be mended ? \ 
Where do we start ? \ 
Who could be so immature ? \ 
How could they do this ? \ 
Where they just that impure ? \ 
Can anything be said to set this right ? \ 
Is there any hope at all ? \ 
Or is it a futile fight ? \ 
I believe there is an answer . \ 
I believe there is a cure . \ 
It may not be that simple . \ 
But it will be helpful for sure . \ 
Okay . Going to get off of here and finish getting around . Off to get those pesky books ! Hope everyone has a great day !!!! 
I got all my books ! Even better i was able to find used ones !!! \ 
Home !!!! Okay , I think I pulled a muscle yesterday cause my back hurts a lot !

If your Mom is or was your hero , your best friend , or just the best Mom ever , if you are blessed to still have your Mom or if she is an angel in heaven , paste this to your status and let everyone know you are proud of your Mom , and that you love her dearly . You can replace a lot of people in life , but you only have one Mom

Well I guess I get the house to myself today . Its nice to finally have a little bit of quiet time . No people tromping in and out bringing snow and cold into the house . ^ ^ 
Trying to work on Homework , and getting distracted by facebook and the fact that a new episode of The Big Bang Theory is coming on tonight !!! Best show ever !!!

Wish I knew why I'm feeling so out of it ... So irritating to feel lost . 
Well I guess its time to hit the hay , No storm so yeah Whooo ... 
Sorting through , craziness , disappointment , jealousy , emptiness , and the odd feeling that my life is a tredmil I am moving forward but getting nowhere and it wouldn't matter if I was walking or running I would get no where just as fast . 
Today just ... Yeah I've had better days ... 
I'm thinking that males have out lived thief usefulness . They just ... Grrr ... Honestly whatever just walk away while I'm talking to you maybe it will just go away . 
Guess I'm just disappointed . Shouldn't expect people to care or listen . Wish my car worked . I need to get out of here ... 
Bad day getting better . Did a lot of walking around town and about to dine on the fine cooking of Mr. Pizza hut . :D

5 DEADLY TERMS USED BY A WOMAN : 1 ) FINE-this is the word women use to end an argument when they know they are RIGHT and YOU need to SHUT UP . 2 ) NOTHING-means SOMETHING and u need to be WEARY . 3 ) GO AHEAD-this is a dare not permission DO NOT DO IT . 4 ) WHATEVER-is a woman's way of saying FORGET YOU ! 5 ) THAT'S OK-she is thinking long and hard on HOW and WHEN you will pay for your mistake . ** Re-post if u agree **

The end of a matter is better than it's beginning , and < PROPFEMALE > is better than pride . Ecclesiastes 7:8

Dear God , My little sister is in a lot of pain . Help the medicine make the pain go away and give her the strength to deal with it till it gets better , please let this be nothing serious . Give her supportive friends and understanding teachers/boss . Let all this be done if it is your will . Amen . \ 
( Everyone please , your thoughts and prayers are appreciated , we are all really worried ) 
Hoping that things will get better soon 
Just finished my health concepts test . I think I did okay I missed 5 out of 20 on the multiple choice but I think I did better on the short answer ( won't know until the teacher gets online and grades it though ) . 
Hey peoples ! I'm doing a project for Child Psychology that is about me and tracing events that may have effected who I am today . Anyone have any memories with me that they wouldn't mind sharing .

Happy birthday to the best mom ever !! 
productive day so far . Church , lunch with loved ones , walmart , got the living room and kitchen cleaned up , mom's gifts are ready , and now I'm taking a small break 
It's kinda scary when you realize you have less than a month left in class and that your deadlines are way closer than they first appeared .
