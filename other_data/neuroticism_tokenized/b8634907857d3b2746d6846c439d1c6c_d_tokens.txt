When purple unicorns try to ride neon green bikes through buildings under construction it's always good to have a best friend to lend you a bike chain once done or in need of a break ...

Gosh I seriously miss my meow meows already . 
DEPRESSION is not a sign of weakness it is a sign that you have been trying to be strong for too long . Put this as your status if you or you know someone who has or has had depression . Most people wont , but it's mental health week and 1 in 3 of us will suffer some point in our lives . Show your support good people . 
Just saw a couple letters written to my father , from the ex , all lies- ALL LIES ! and it hurts so f'n much ! Trying to just let it go though cause it ain't worth it . :'( I wish my kitties were here to cheer me up- bad ! 
Wasn't going to play that game , but it just all got to be too much . I officially have a couple people blocked now to keep fb more pleasant for myself . :) 
Pictures being posted !! WOOT

Getting settled in . 
To think of things on a more possitive note , thank you for this phrase Aleksey , I have finally found my proof of concept . So I should think of this as a good sign rather than just another dissappointment .

No beach . :'(

sleep- maybe ? .... 
saying goodbye to people you're not going to see for a long time is hard . knowing you'll get to see some of those people from a previous parting soon makes you realize that you never really loose someone no matter the distance- time just seems to be the enemy here ... 
After forcing self back to sleep this am- got 8 hours total ... Dreams , lots of dreams ...

hi-ho hi-ho it's off to work I go .... 
I love a job that pays cash at the end of shift- deals with alcohol knowledge- and has good people to work with- I just paid one of my 4 bills past due- woot me ! ^__^ LOL Now time for pizza and anime with Aleksey Nelipa ! 
weird dreams all night .... sooo tired today . 
heading to the shop again ! 
Headed home with some free cheap beer . Almost embarrassed to < PROPFEMALE > it home with me ! Lol 
????! ^^ 
why is it so hard to wake up in the am these days ? 
Off to the bar ... err I mean work . ;) 
drink and gossip time with < PROPFEMALE > Molner to commence shortly ! ^__^ 
found out the soup I just ate has bonito in it- a type of fish , we shall see how I feel in a few hours ... ... 
everyone hates us ... :( boo It's a Saturday night , can everyone really be sleeping right now ?! 
< PROPFEMALE > Molner passed out on me without warning ... :( May be I should sleep too .... 
I just want to enjoy life , is that really too much to ask for ?! 
I'm tired , and hungry , and whinny , and am going back to sleep cause that will at least delay and or fix most of these problems . \ 
PS : joining okc when you're drunk with your bff is not always a good idea . HAHA 
3 hour nap , dreams of working < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > shop- puddles on pillows to prove story ... haha Time ( past due ) to get up and get outta here to < PROPFEMALE > Kopacek place for an evening of drinks and more catching up . Then a night of driving around to find closer , free , parking near where I live ... 
Found free parking ( but not always a guarantee ) only 4 blocks from home . ^___^ YAY ! ( Residential parking permits are so expensive . ) Nap time . Then helping Aleksey Nelipa buy furniture . 
Saw the Owl movie and Resident Evil's new one , both in 3D thanks to < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > . The owl one was cute and made the 4 year-old in me very happy , and well I love Milla but I'd love to see all the films run together as one- these hangings and incomplete connections are starting to wear on me , which is saying a lot cause I really do love her films ... 
tried to figure out skype to stay in touch with a friend- 3 guys in minutes asked me to show my boobs/ play cam games . WTF ?! Blocked ... but really , I thought this kind of lack of class was done for by now .... boo skype , boo ... 
No food makes sleeping seem like a really good thing .... Back to dream land for me ! 
Sweet dreams FBers <3 <3 
Off to clean house ... 
not a good day after all ... fuck it . 
Gomen < PROPFEMALE > 
I splurged on pizza- with coupons should last me a couple weeks worth of food . Now that I have food in me I feel a bit better . 
MOved boxes- not cleaned or organized , but a start- going out for the night- then need to rush back in am for delivery . 
trying to make sense of things 
I really wish it wasn't 2pm on a Thursday already . 
off to fight the b-line to work . 
I hate being in a place in my life where I cannot take care of my own simple just to live needs . This is f'n ridiculous . I'm an f'n joke , but I'm so tired I can't laugh anymore . 
it could be so much worse ... i just need to build on what i have so far- step by step , right mama ? ^_ < 
Someone actually emailed my boss about me taking wine sales to the next level in this store . So awesome !! ^_^ 
It's so hot out !!! Been in the mid 80s for 2 days now . WTF ?! 
I just wanna stay in bed- but alas I must now get ready for work ... maybe going out last night not such a good idea- but hey , It was fun ! 
sooo tired ....................... -_- 
I paid my < PROPMALE > s- yay- thanks to help from my dad all my < PROPMALE > s for the next 2 weeks are paid . I'm completely broke , but hey , only till next thursday- oh wait then that goes to a different < PROPMALE > - will the torture never end ?! * shakes head * 
I think watching anime may be bad for my health . I keep hoping for a miracle where I get to power up and save the world . LOL 
The sky's looking like fall ! 
Sometimes when I cry for really no logical reason I wonder why , but maybe it's just my way of releasing , the way others get angry or do crazy and stupid things ... 
Gomen < PROPFEMALE > . 
It's funny how mothers really do know you ( or at least mine knows me very well ) . 
There are a few people I've been trying to reach for a while now . Even though we are fb friends as well , the messages here and cell texts have gone unanswered . Even if it was to say they were upset for some reason ( not even saying the reason ) , or just really busy , or just don't want to talk to me right now- I wish they'd at least respond . I wish they'd say hey what's up back , or at least let me know they still care . 
wow- after only about 2 months it took me 3 hours to clean the bathroom ... -_- Is it just me or has anyone else noticed how much more elbow grease one must use when using green cleaning products . I mean it was much nicer on hands and to breath than regular , but that took way too long . ^^ ;; 
May we all be spared zombies from our dreams tonight- ???????? 
Why am I never tired when it's actually time to sleep ? - I've hardly been sleeping at all lately , but resting plenty to make up for it . And when I finally do fall asleep , I wake up early because of dreams or just my internal clock- so sad . 
Not enough sleep- shoots- I guess it will be starbucks stop for me on way to work today ...

I'm really not looking forward to the next 9.5 hours ... -_- 
Purse latch broke , Umbrella broke , raining , now wet , 2 trains pass me without stopping , running 20 minutes late to work now , I'm in a shitty ass pissed off mood and not wanting to be in a customer service job today ! fml indeed , at least today . Grrrrr x_x 
first full night's rest in well over a week ! yay ! Almost 11 hours . 
Good night , but I kinda wish I was asleep ... 
What a sunday night !! 
head and tummy hurt- two different reasons ... great night though ! 
the fire alarm down the street has been going off for 2 hours now- headache not getting any better -_- 
... 
I smell a fire and hear sirens , it must be really close . O.o 
Lilpri Kawaii ! ^^ ;; 
Sleep is sooo good .... Didn't realize how much I missed it . 
ignore the virus link !!!!!! 
feeling a little nostalgic as I lay to rest tonight ... should make for interesting dreams ... Amai yume , < PROPFEMALE > . 
thank you for all your support , both large and small , over the long years or since we just met- I really appreciate having so many brilliant and kind people in my life . 
I like it wherever it ends up being . 
Funny how anime gives me a fulfilled feeling nothing much else in my life does right now . Guess every girl really does just want to live a fairy-tale ... 
I want my happily ever after < PROPFEMALE > tale life so bad , it hurts . Pathetic and childish , I know , but one can't change how they feel . It's taken me years , but I finally understand that now ... 
trying to find a balance , I need to find my balance . 
Tossed and turned all night- maybe 4 hours ? 
fun night out on the town ... 
I think I may have twisted my ankle while dancing with the cadge dancer tonight ... Oh well- it was fun . Sweet dreams all . Time to sleep . ^_ ~ 
Wow- when haven't danced in a while , dancing for a few hours straight makes my body sore . I need to get back into shape . 
Furniture and paint shopping- house will be amazingly put together soon ! 
Registered for Japanese language course today ! This will be my winter ( and beyond ) project . 
Yay to the sound of rain ! 
Wow- it's 50 degrees out right now .... Hello Fall , when did you get here ? 
I liked falling asleep to the sound of rain last night- much better than the party going on across the street , just out my window right now ... 
Can't wait to see everyone coming to today's wine bash ! ^___^ 
Party time !!! If you find yourself bored and in the Brighton area- come on over ! 
It's only 7:30 ? 
Great party yesterday ! Party started at noon for the roomies , first guest arrived at 3:20 pm , last guest left at noon today ( party stopped at 6am)- crazy fun times in 24 hours . Thanks to all who helped to make it a success ! Poo on all who missed out . ^_ < 
Power outages when it's already dark out sucks ! 
... O.o ... 
Ready or not ! 
Feeling the love , death , disco coming on ... 
Is happy . 
Is so tired ... 
shoots ! I'm running late !!!! 
Planning out my week next week and still needs to find something to do for halloween . Suggestions ? 
Sunday stats ... And still need to find out what to do for halloween ... And should sleep soon ...

..................................

wishes for cuddles and hugs one day soon . 
The storm killed the Internet ...? 
Awoke rather depressed and sad . I hate it when dreams dictate emotion into your regular life ... 
Ya-Ha ! 
Another crazy dream . This time I traveled back in time to the Romans . Kinda cool dream . But with unexpected guest appearances . 
10 days left and 8 minutes left on daytime for my cell ..... If you have at&t can you please let me know so I can know who I can talk to for free ! ^_ < 
Happy 11:11 everyone ( EST ) 
OMG . <3 <3 
Happy 11/11 to all my loved ones !! 
My head hurts this am .... 
Blarg . I dont wanna leave my cozy warm bed ... 
when it gets chilly outside and I stop being able to feel my hands when I'm outta bed , it makes me want to hibernate . 
IF YOU TRY TO FAIL , AND SUCCEED , WHICH HAVE YOU DONE ? ( stolen from < PROPFEMALE > Leinau Myers- thank you ) 
perplexed by status words used all too often- sounding dull ... 
Oyasumi 
Konnichiwa mina-san .

On my way to see < PROPMALE > Potter- ^^ 
Back to cleaning ! No trip to CR for me it seams ... T_T 
sorry- I'm feeling down . DAMN YOU AIRLINES ! Damn you to hell ... T_T 
Whatever . Today's plans are shot . I'm done . Sorry all ! 
Wow . A little disappointment , and a few canceled and changed plans totally just threw me into an anxiety attack that's now been going on nearly 4 hours . Sorry to you all for the crazy updates I've been posting . I'm gonna go back to sleep to try and calm down . L8r 
Are we supposed to share our internal thoughts , trails , and tribulations to everyone we know ? Does this help or hinder the relationships we have with others ? ( the thought that came to mind as I drifted off to sleep . Thought I'd share . ^_ ~ ) 
Back to the normal grind of life , but feeling much better today . Wish I was in Maine getting shit done and seeing friends , but this is okay too ... 
Going to CR 1/18-2/1 now !!! If I can't be there for new years , then at least I can be there for my birthday ! Had to push the date back to get the same price ticket as when I looked it up last week . Class will start on 2/28 now instead , but I think pushing it back is ok cause of this trip . Will work on my Japanese with my roommate on our own till then ... ^___^ 
Sleep , true rest , really does a body good . I needed last night bad . Now off to sell vino on this beautiful Thursday . 
Busy cooking for week : Spinach/ turnip and ricotta pastries , veggie burgers , twice baked potatoes , cauliflower soufflé , < PROPFEMALE > potatoes , veggie chili , and cornbread ... Yay late night cooking ! 
Cooking till the sun came up , this tired girl questions her choice .., 
What an amazing party with brilliantly talented people from all walks of life coming together to sing drunk and dance merrily .... I had a great time thanks to everyone's contribution ! ( pictures to come ) 
Wow . Literally had to fight the devil in my dreams . Stupid haunted houses ... 
What an awesome day of cleaning and fixing and making pretty- thanks for the help < PROPFEMALE > and Rider ! 
It's a bit chilly but < PROPFEMALE > and blue skies . Going out to run errands and enjoy ! 
If you don't eat top ramen for a few years , it's actually quite tasty . ^^ 
Happy Thanksgiving everyone on fb ! 
Feeling pumped ! 
What a strange day . * shakes head * 
my tummy is all in nots ... I just wanna get through today in one piece . 
Dance Dance 
Stupid dreams again last night- I hate having anxiety . 
is happy that there is good news of great people and fun projects to help wash away the anxiety left behind by my dreams . 
wishes for chocolate- oh great . 
Why am I awake ? 
Start the destruction construction ... 
There is a train full of people I like , a plane full of people I admire , and a canoe full of people I love- lucky for me there is only a mini-cooper full of people out there to harm me ... As long as I stay off their roads I should be fine . \ 
^_ < Written by me , 11/29/2010 . 
Met with personal trainer today- hurts but the good kind- Loving it ! 
So it won't be for a couple of months yet , but , going to take a small poll now --- should I go back to being a redhead ? The natural blonde has been fun enough , but I think I'm really missing the red hair ... \ 
So , what do you think- should I stay blonde ( natural ) , or go strawberry blonde , or go kinda orange , or fire engine red w/ gold highlights ? 
Stupid fucking Google gave me the wrong address for this fucking bar I've never been to and sent me to a stupid fucking area I didn't need to go to and I'm starting this night off pissed . Boo . -_- Attitude adjustment is in order . 
I'm sooo tired !!!!! But I'm having so much fun ! 
Got 13 hours last night- gym , wine shop , clean , study , bed .

I love snow , but it sure does look and sound scary out . 
10 hour shift , off at 11 , will be bringing in 2011 in Beacon Hill ! If you're in the area and in need of some bubbly , stop on by to celebrate the end of ' 10 . 
A true friend doesn't care when you're broke , being a bitch , what you weigh , if your house is a mess , what you drive , about your past , or if your family is filled with crazy people . Your conversations pick up where they left off , even if they have been months apart . They love you ..... for who you are -- repost if you have at least one true friend . They will know who they are . 
The As are done- now a personal message time out to get ready for work ... I will contact all you lovelies soon . Beware ! ^_ < 
Next 13 days are going to be crazy as I get ready for my trip to Costa Rica baby ! Love you all but will continue to be offline a lot . Call me if you really need me ! 
Ok- so it may end up taking a month or two , but now done contacting the Bs ... On to the Cs next time as I've spent too much time online today as it is ... Darn you fb for taking away real life time ! But thank you for connecting me to my loved ones too ... 
waking up with a cold sucks ... 
Pay It Forward 2011 : I promise to send something handmade to the first 5 people who comment here .

Outran the storm . Safely tucked in for the night in NH . Yay snow . Just hope the BMV will be open tomorrow . 
BMV a success ! Safely back in NH for snow day !! 
Happiness ... is not a destination : it is a manner of traveling . Happiness is not an end in itself . It is a by-product of working , playing , loving and living . \ 
This definition of happiness by Haim Ginott . 
There are a lot of people I need to connect with and most are long overdue . Sorry I've been so MIA . <3 and aloha out to all my loved ones . I'll be back from Costa Rica in February and will dedicated that month to reconnecting ( along with living this crazy beautiful life I live ! ) . TTYAL 
Sh ! t Must hurry to the shop !!!!!! Available by cell for 2 more days ! <3<3 
Last day and I'm a mess !!!!!!! <3 
My tummy is acting up now that the flights are so soon . I'm excited !! 
I'm about to leave for the tropics ! WOOT !!!!!!!! 
On my way . Currently a looooong layover in NC . Drinking at 7:30 am ? Ok if you haven't stopped since the night before , right ? Last < PROPMALE > for phone to work till feb . 
Costa Rica here I come ! 
Living up the 65-85 degree weather , tons of photos already to start posting , having a blast , probably putting on weight from all the amazing food --- going to see waterfalls and hummingbird gardens or the natural hot springs tomorrow and doing the other on friday . I'm thinking the hot springs on friday for a relaxing birthday though ... 
Off to La < PROPFEMALE > to see the largest know waterfalls , etc . 
Day in theLa Pez rainforest was awesome ! Tomorrow is not just my b-day but also the hot springs , canopy adventure , another volcano national park area to explore . Late , so will have to post pictures from today later ... But they include butterfly attacks , luscious landscapes and of course a chicken suit ... FUN ! 
Oh happy day . ( and yes , I was up at 4am this morning and am about to go catch a 6 am bus to Arenal Volcano Hot Springs and Canopy adventure !!! 
Red Bull seems the same here but Coke tastes better cause it's made from sugar instead of corn syrup ... just saying ... 
Holding hands ( well paw in hand ) with < PROPFEMALE > as I drift to sleep . She's a darling , but I miss my boyz- all of them ! 
A pamper tropical day- 83 degrees out , nice breeze , doing may nails , hanging out and watching some of my favorite movies that are actually being played on TV here , having amarula and ice creme- totally relaxation ... Tomorrow brings me to Panama . I hope to spend the rest of my life traveling ! 
packing up for panama ! 
On my way to Panama NOW ! <3 
Or not . Poo !!!! T_T Seems the bus sold out on Friday and there are no 6am ( which is the bus I need ) till Thursday . Going to see if I can find another way there . Totally bummed out right now . 
Panama is brilliant ! 
Last day in Panama , and hoping the sun will come back out ! 
Back in Costa Rica till Tuesday ! Pictures to come tomorrow !! <3 ing this trip !!! Got to go for a bike ride now- vroom vroom 
CR is crazy as everything has fallen into place so my friends are all moving -- may not be seeing much more before I leave here in 3 days .... 
Going back out to enjoy the day ( only a little over one day left here T_T ) Having a blast ! Had really great food from the farmer's market here this am . Can't wait to see what else is in store for me before I leave thanks to < PROPFEMALE > , Runar and < PROPFIRST > ! 
it feels weird 1)seeing a movie in CR that's in English but with Spanish subtitles and laying in numbered leather reclining seats a foot away from any other patron , and 2)making a status update about a movie about facebook to begin with ... lol Wow , this site sure is an interesting one ... 
I love layers , don't get me wrong , but I'm so not looking forward to the snowstorm I'm returning to tomorrow .... Boo . T_T But I do look forward to seeing my loved ones again ! 
There is a flight cancellation advisory due to this storm that's coming ... I need to see what to do- stay here , risk being stuck for 2 days in NC- or leave like right now ?! idk what my actual options are ... Oh and I've used up all my trip money ... Poo to you snow ! T_T 
OK , going to go to the airport tomorrow and check with them before checking in , change flight if needed and if not I'll head home- I'll record the attendant so that if I do get stuck in NC I can play it back for a free stay or something- I will fight this time if they screw me ! 
Going to try and make it to the airport today- we shall see if Boston weather will let me travel or not ... 
well as of right now my flights are all good , let's hope nothing changes on my way !! 
Headed to the airport !!!! Wish me luck and safe travels . <3 See my Boston Peeps soon !!!! 
I'm on my flight about to leave for Boston !! 
I'm in Boston !!!! Goodnight all . 
Re-posting for a friend ... 52 thoroughbred horses need homes . Will go to Sugarcreek this Saturday for slaughter . Gentleman died ; his son wants nothing to do with them . Most broodmares are broke & some are in foal weaning , yearlings , 2 & 3 yr olds .. most are gelded . FREE and papered . Friend of the deceased is trying to find homes 440-463-4288 or 440-463-4288 Barnesville , OH . Please copy and paste this on your status ! 
I cannot believe it's already 1pm- F*CK ! 
Crazy person doing bad things , so I'm on my way to report him to the police , sad it had to come to this ... 
So ubber stressed out- what a waste of my brain power and energy ... 
Girl scout cookies at 2am = sick morning . Not a good idea . Boo . 
I fell asleep . Guess we know how I handle stress ... 
Green Bay Packers beat the Pittsburgh Steelers 31-25 to win Super Bowl XLV ( I win ! ^^) 
What a slow shift . Headed home now . 
inability to drag and drop photos now here is annoying- how am I to get all my CR pics now ? Boo FB , boo ... Downloading one at a time f'n sucks ! 
Time to get creative ! Then < PROPFEMALE > Autumn show tonight !!!! 
Never enough hours in a day . 
15 minutes till show time . Intro waiting music , old cartoons tracks . You know it'll be an interesting night . 
Show was awesome- burlesque , tease , comedy , love , music , girl on girl action , audience participation ... Got to see my favorite song performed during the encore . Only complaint is that the stage was a bit too low so couldn't see everything ... On good side , by not being right up front I didn't get covered in tea , rum , spit , or cookie spray ... If you've ever seen EA perform , you'd know what I mean ... 
What a lovely day yesterday . Best Valentines Day ever , so far . ^_ ~ 
I sure can be am emotional baby when I don't have anything to eat ... 
Time to go snow sled/tubbing !!! 
Like any human alive , \ 
I just wanna thrive . \ 
Surround myself with passionate people ;\ 
Can life be so simple ? \ 
Continuously living the adventure ; \ 
It's a real deal clincher . \ 
Then giving back to earth and society more than I receive . \ 
Well why not ? One should be able to believe . \

Woke up REALLY early ... been working on updates for my school applications . 
$420 worth of kitchen stuff and food . Gonna be cooking all day tomorrow for the next few weeks . This place is gonna smell so nice !!! ^_ , ^ 
Figuring out just how to help is hard work , but better than just worrying I guess ... 
Something just for fun : Send me a story . Catch - six words only . No more . No less . 
feeling a bit overwhelmed ... 
Cooked/ing , cleaning , caught up with roommate , planing out BM ... This morning has been quit productive indeed ... Back to the washing board for me now ... 
Note to self ( and everyone else ) Clean as you go , waiting 2months means many hours of scrubbing ... This may be a project for the whole week ! lol ( in a hysteric kinda way- he he ) 
I hate that it is already 1pm ... 
Getting ready to Rally ... noon , statehouse , hope to see you all there in your respective cities ! Will post pictures ... 
Pro workers , pro people , pro choice ! 
\What are the built in drinking holidays ? March is pretty heavy . Then there's Easter . \"" 
I'm in a helping others kinda mood today . ^__^ 
Awoke- LATE- and already an interesting day ... 
Happy Hina-matsuri ! 
Cleaning and Packing , then work , then a very long drive to New Orleans !!!! 
No Molner . Waiting . Sad . 
Hitting the road , a new adventure to be had as the players and pieces change . 
Bad googlemaps , stuck in mud , saved by Scottish couple , tow truck , and $50 ( ouch ) , on the rode again , dirty but venturing forward . 
Yay adventures ! ( missing one ? Just add water to dirt ) 
Made it !!!! Parked and heading to find spot for first parade . 
Day 2 ! Rain's come early sadly . Going to bike around today regardless . There are over 10 parades to seek out . Much goodies to catch ! Much fun to have ... Not sure where we'll be staying tonight after such a long day . Headed to see Aunt and Grandma tomorrow or Thursday depending on sleeping situation tonight . 
It's 4pm and the boobs are coming out ! Having drinks on a balcony on burbon st. It's crazy here !!! 
<3 what a wonderful vacation . Seeing family and < PROPFEMALE > falls tomorrow . Home by Friday evening . Crazy weather , crazy good times , loving life ! 
On the road again ... 
Back in Mass , slept , feeling pretty food . Had to cut trip short due to lack of funds but had an amazing time . Picking up klaus from airport this evening and returning home . Woot 
Best wishes to all my friends and their families in Japan and Hawaii . Hope you're all safe . 
Waiting for Klaus at airport . Very M@$$hole cop just threatened me with $100 ticket for sitting too long plus a ticket for texting and driving for having my phone in my lap . WTF ?! I said fine I'll move as soon as he asked me . Poo on him . 
Car moved , pictures uploaded ! \ 
Now : quick nap , start house cleanup , get ready- spending day in Salem with Klaus < PROPMALE > , and hopefully catching up with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > while up there tonight . 
playing magic the gathering for the first time ever ... laugh , I am too ... 
Even with the disaster in Japan they still had current anime episodes come out , and there was only a one day delay in translating them ... I'm impressed , and hope that this simple sign of life continuing on means that the recovery time won't be too too long for their society . 
Happy 4:20 , I guess . Headed to sleep now . 
I'm cooking with 2 people passed out and another rushing back and forth to the bathroom ... what a hangover day . Glad I was mama hen last night and am feeling fine ... 
Never enough hours in a day , never enough days in a week , and always more to do , see , create , explore ... 
The day and shenanigans have already begun . Happy SPD !! 
Won tickets to see Cake 4/22 , and meet and greet tickets for the Dropkicks tomorrow ! Now listening to Black 47 perform and drinking a Guinness . Go Green !!
