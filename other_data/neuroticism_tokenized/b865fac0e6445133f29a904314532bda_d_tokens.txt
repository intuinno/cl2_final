I made a Facebook .. I really don't know why though .. =/ 

Wow , its boring ... 
eh , guess its just because I don't have any facebook friends .. =/ 
added people .. =/ 
I've always wondered what this wall thing is for .. am I supposed to act like people care about this stuff . or is it more for myself , like a journal , sorta . =/ 
I'm bored as all hell . I'm gonna go listen to music . 
Wow am I hyper right now , just drank 2 cans of mountain dew and listened to some nu-metal . I'm gonna go run some laps or something , lol 
I'm still up .. >__> Listening to music .. 
weekend over ... frowny face . 
Almost done with school work I've been procrastinating on .. 
tried learning beat it on my guitar .. got the intro down though ... 
I have a headache .. it sucks ... :( 
I just realized that facebook has a chat thing .. 
Wow I'm tired , just got home from a hike .. The hike itself wasn't that tiring but the fact that I only got 4 hours of sleep was .. >__> 
trance music is so uplifting :D 
just downloaded some music , hardcore punk and folk metal , odd mix but good nonetheless 
I'm sick today .. :( 
I'm listening to Ska :D 
Christmas , < PROPFEMALE > , happy , and all that :D 
I'm still up for some unknown reason ... eh , I'll go to bed in and hour . 
LOL @the iPad . It's just a big iPod touch with no flash capabilities .. 
WHY IS EVERYTHING CHANGING ALL THE TIME D: 
Stupid PSAT giving me so much mail . I don't want to go to some college in Missouri .. =/
