The back button on my DDR pad broke . ;.; I've had it three or four years so I guess that is pretty good considering how much I play DDR . Well time to trade in some games and get a universal dance pad .... 
I wonder why I keep getting all of these bruises ... Wacth my brother is probably sneaking in my room at night and beating me with a baseball bat . o.o but since we don't own a baseball bat I guess I probably just keep falling of the bed without noticing . ^^ ;; 
listening to slacker radio .. I love five finger death punch xD <3 
I wish it was still storming I think it is cooler outside than in my house :/ 
Sorry if I'm annoying ... I guess thats the long term effect of not having a single mutual friendship until sixth grade @.@ 
anyone know where to buy a key for the tennis court ? 
For the longest time I've wondered why people kept saying \no homo\ " randomly after their sentences ... it was finally explained to me yestereday . I also thought fot awhile lmbo was just a typo for lmao but then I realized the a is no where near the b on the keyboard . >.>" 
I really wish I had < PROPFIRST > poppin's outrageously big purse right now . 
aww I found my old super nintendo and all my games XD but then ... I remember a < PROPFEMALE > got lodged in it . D ' : 
Today is my parents aniversay :D my dad bought cheese and crackers ? lol well I'm going to play more DDR already lost twenty pounds :p

I wanna win some tickets to lady gaga's concert so bad I mean shes cool but if someone gives me a ride to win them I'll probably give them away since I know there are die hard fans . I just wanna do that impersonation to win them . and for those of you who are thinking \oh god\ " well hey dancing at the peprally is not even an effort . This is my turf . This is acting . SO tell me what YOU think and can you give me a ride ? " 
well the contest is today .. wish me luck guys :) 
had a dream that mrs viar was putting on some kinda 300 play in hell and everyone had to go through these epic training montages . oh and the best part[besides the 3 effects ] was probably how she expected that a series of warm ups and west side story dancing could protect us from the flames . @.@ actually almost everyone in school was in it :p 
might be moving to a better house soon ... like this month . I really hope so =.= 
I finally found my new pokemon game =3 and now that its summer I haven't been able to put it down ... o.o I know I know <--- mega geek . but hey I don't judge you based on your obsessions with twilight , hello < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > beiber , care bears , sesame street t-shirts or whatever . plus don't tell me you haven't loved pokemon at one point in your life ... unless you've never tried it . ^_^ 
bored .. :/ -sigh- i wish I could sleep but I'm on complete graveyards .. probably won't be asleep till noon :( 
spending the night with my awesome < PROPMALE > :) i finally get to leave this cramped house -for something other than the grocery store deep breath- its only been two weeks but it feels like decades :) 
ok Imma do the likey hing . so like this status and I'll tell you likes , dislikes , first impression , a song and just for fun ... how I think you are gonna meet your \end\ " -for me I'm going to die of laughter I just know it . xD " 
I gave up on oblivion , [ due to the fact my game kept corrupting]but , this is my 2nd dream since ! My theatre class was raiding villages , but I was low on hp & only had a shot gun so after fleeing from a < PROPFEMALE > I returned to base . Everyone was trading their treasure- a bunch of < PROPFEMALE > sunglasses ? Then we heard bandits coming to ransack US . I ran out with a sword , only to find it was a prop & this hun kills me in one hit ! 
These past weeks have been crazy , I got my tooth pulled then I got two shots , but it was pretty awesome that my uncle I hadn't seen in years came down . + I got to see my first 3d movie [ though I screamed when a spider jumped out ] I also saw eclipse again with < PROPFEMALE > . [ when I look at < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > I can't stop thinking about geometry ! with her oval head and his outrageously square one ] , honestly idk what I see in it 
Well its crunchtime ... we're packing boxes like crazy and we will be starting to move everything on the first ... Then there is band camp in the middle of it all . To top it off I still haven't touched that book for english T^T wahh I miss my naps ! >.< 
finished unpacking ... now we have like eight people freeloading over here :p why is it all of my dad's friends are suave and admirable when my dad is so lame ? xD 
anyone know what time drug testing is today ? 
drug testing is over with- thank god I was scared for my life that I would be the only one needing a cup o.o < PROPFEMALE > jyixed me and I was one of the first to turn in , but last to finish ... well now < PROPFEMALE > is at my place till camp :p 
I'm kinda angry that i missed the deadline for signing up for dual credit because my family was MOVING D:< ... I'll have to talk to the counslers to see if there is anything I can do . :( 
wahh bottom locker :'( well at least I'm in dual credit by some magical enrollment of the gods xD 
>____________< I had a nightmare that zombies ate my moms brains ... I can't sleep o.o 
grr I'm sick of this < PROPFIRST > beiber chick ! D: looks like any other prepubescent little thing and people young and old are fawning all over him ... and don't even get me startedon his music >.> 
we may be behind but i feel like I've learned alot for the alotted practice time ... of course alot doesn't mean enough . -HOORAY FOR GIANT FREE BOXES- \\(^_^)/ 
What the heck ? How did I wake up this late ? Now my day will be sapped right before my eyes . :( 
Preparing for another day of extended hours in the sun ... its one thing I can't tan and burn but ... I'm starting to hate the fact that all of my clothes are black :'( 
who needs superstitions like friday the 13th ? I'm unlucky everyday of the year , and call me crazy but I'm starting to like it xD 
nothing like an awesome guitar riff to get you pumped :D 
Sometimes I just wanna take my memories and put them in a cardboard box then leave them in a dark alleyway when its raining to be mauled by hungry cats ... hopefully memories taste like tuna :) 
I was supposed go school supplies shopping tomorrow but .. I think I'll push it back a day if < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > are cool with seeing vampires suck then xD 
so ... what do you guys think , penguins or squirrels ? o.o 
oh gosh I love 80's music <3 I must've been born in the wrong decade ! http://chatter.com/a/h0xzw?ref=nf 
Woo practice tonight was AWESOME ! <3 I love stands music <3 can't wait for the first football game .. excluding half time that is xD 
finally got some tennis shoes for marching practice :p now I don't have to surgically remove my feet and stitch them to my shins to show that my toes are up :D 
I'm bored I just wanna go to parent's night already ... listening to poison and other classics ... i just realized how many dudes named < PROPFIRST > came out with hits in the 80's ... < PROPFIRST > squier , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > idol , and no telling who else . maybe it comes with the name ? xD 
I think that went surprisingly good :D lets all bring our parents to competition xD 
I've got too much to do this year ... once school starts monday i'm gonna have to give up video games until summer :( well its a healthy switch right ? hehe =___= 
I've been up since 7 p.m !!! wow i can't imagine how badly imma crash after practice today @__@ well at least there isn't really anything to learn on the first day ... 
anyone who doesn't like their 8th period should change to the techer instructional practice thing we only have eight people right now :P we will get to do tons of stuff like lead field trips- ideal if you like kids =) 
every action has its consequence-be it good or bad whether it effects you or others . sympathy can only go so far you know . i undersatnd death is a horrible tragic thing , and no person sane person including myself would ever wish it upon someone else . however when you play with fire-you get burned , when you do drugs ... anyway know the risks . 
-sigh- a weekend of homework and cleaning :/ 
apcalyptica's new ablum end of me just came out/coming out love how they can turn a quartet into hard rock <3 
well I now solemnly eat my last pb sandwhich , for in the morning when my mom sees how I accidently f'd up her grill shes gonna kill me , worst of all darn apple butter wouldn't open .. I at least wanted to enjoy my last sanwhich in peace , well screw you peanut butter , screw you apple butter -no i musn't blame food for it is a fat ones comfort .. ok then then screw you < PROPFIRST > foreman for making such a stupid design flaw ! 
I just fed my chinchilla one of those red grapes and it was hard enough watching him devour it with his bug eyes scaring me ... but when i fed him another one i saw the juices made his fur around his mouth red . he looks like a freaking carnivourous beast ! o.o -note to self avoid feeding mr. moneybags grapes- 
umm so according to the weather school is canceled tomorrow ? O___o no freakin way man , they better not be yanking my chain . >.< someone help me I'm spazzing out here o.l 
well school or not english has to be done eventually ... so inspirational music is in check and i can only hope my drawings don't look worse than everyone else's >.<

I just tried on my letterman today after having it a couple of weeks and its too big ! :'( anyone who knows me knows i wear loose stuff but this is insane ! if i wore it you wouldn't even see me at all , no joke . >.< well there goes my morning ... 
I HATE my dad , early this week I made him promise he'd have some way for me to get to the carwash .. now his tire fell off and it seems like he makes something happen when i need it the most . He keeps insisting he never said that and now he said hes not getting me anything for my birthday ... not that he can even afford the bills this payday im sure with him taking off four and a half days D:< 
< PROPFIRST > , Kay-T I'm so sorry , words can't explain how ashamed i am of my father right now ... Please get home safe and I can understand why you would hate me . :( 
ughh feeling better I guess I had water poisoning and couldn't sleep .. since i had free time i curled my hair and now i look like a seahag :p .. and seriously what keeps happening to my socks ? o__o 
so other than that weird dream with \jason giddeons spiders\ " and a shortage of laundry today wasn't so bad .. now for the best part of the day .. naptime <3 "

Great i don't know how she did it but my mom set her clock two hours back D: so my uniform is soaked still and i have no time to get ready ... I was going to walk to school today too ... :/

lately I've had insane headaches and heartburns , CURSE YOU ACID REFLUX ! I guess the headaches are from staring at the computer screen too much and the bright light from my uncovered window- I also have reason to suspect this is why I've been < PROPMALE > lately -sigh- still haven't touched my physics homework eh its only monday ... camping at the beach this saturday xD its been so long i couldn't care less about the weather 
I hate megavideo ... I wanna watch now and I'll never pay >:p -sigh- 7 more minutes Im gonna die >.<

Most people have 1000 wishes for Christmas ; a cancer patient only has one to get better . I know 97% of you won't repost this to your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do . In honor of someone who has died , or is still fighting , or survived cancer , copy this to your status 
my brother talks to electronics .. and argues with them o.o ( his laughing sounds like a hyena having an asthma attack ! ) \ 
cucumbers are a fruit darn it ! :o 
isn't it great when people cancel on you last minute ? you know after you made plans and wasted all of your time and money ?... somehow I had a feeling this was gonna happen . D: oh no biggie not like I changed all my plans just for you or anything .. oh wait I did ! 
I can't jittery this is why you don't give me caffeine ! O.O If the weather wasn't like this I'd go run around the block like an idiot ... and my house is too trashed for DDR plus everyone else is sleeping >.< what the heck ? 
this saturday is totally lame :/ 
my brother mistook 3am for 10:30 am when setting my alarm clock ... and I haven't been able to sleep since . =.= 
man practice is canceled ! I hate colds :/ you get over one someone else gets one eventually it gets back to you >.> then it ruins your week at least .

Been up since ten at night doing homework ( I went to bed at 7 ) lets see how long until I pass out . At least its done ?? >.< -another loooooooong week . - 
band spaghetti fundraiser went alright ... but now I'm super tired , I shall sleep on the thoughts of how to raise money by myself since that was probably the last fundraiser the booster club was sponsoring and I had $200 to raise before today . ( that didn't change much . ) >.< 
I finally got a new mouse yesterday form my uncle :D 
I don't want to go to sleep but I'm out of ideas as of what else to do right now =.= 
Drum < PROPMALE > tryouts day after tomorrow ... I'll be ready ;D gotta do my essay then practice my conducting . I still have to think of a salute O___O 
Finished my intense essay . >:D Man i love being a good writer , it is so handy . :) I practiced for hours last night and so more practice today , and I can't wait for Saturday ! xD 
< PROPFEMALE > Garden is heaven on earth <3 Food and decor are amazing , and the service is great . If only they had pull out beds for when you are too full to make the ride home :p Well G'night 
I've come up with my salute 100% original :) Off to auditions now , and my dad is in a lovely mood as always . :/ \ 
pfft < PROPFEMALE > of England foreign dignitaries ... 
My dog smells like cheetos ! :/ 
Man the customer service on this site is the best <3 I wanted to spend $40 so bad to get a $30 off coupon , unfortunately I could only spend $20 ... I still got one and its in the cutest asian envolope <3 Hurray for chinese new year ! :D 
Aww man I thought we'd at least be able to have practice sunday ... I'm super worried about competition this year :( curse you district rules ! D: 
Oh well now i have Sunday to relax ... Just kidding flyers or not I still need to write our speeches , make a skit , compare prices , and do some more research . >.< I'm not sure why I sign up to do all of these things , but at least it is for a good cause right ? I hope I'm not jumping headfirst into adulthood though ... RESPONSIBILITY IS TOO STRESSFUL ! @__@ 
This button mashing doesn't help my carpal tunnel ... =__= 
Came home to find that my bro left the bathroom sink on for who knows how long ... and it flooded . :/ What have I done to get pimp slapped again and again without mercy ! D: -that made no sense but Imma pretend it was pretty deep ... off to bed . I have a lot of homework in the morning . - * insert another pimp slap * Alright life you win . >_< 
Competition today ! Lets see what happens . 
Well we got first place yesterday and qualify for state ! Now its time to prepare for my OTHER state competition . Is this year for real ? 
I know the weekend just started but I can't wait for Monday !!! >:D You know what they say about < PROPFEMALE > ! 
I am black hawk ... and these are my creepers ! xD < PROPFEMALE > aguirre you know what I'm sayin ' 
Are we really related ? Its hard to believe you are even human much less my family ... What happened over the years ? we use to be so close . :( If it keeps going like this you'll be shot for sure , do you even care ?!?! 
Clinic is today , but I was so anxious I only managed to sleep two hours ! D: 
Anyone know anything about being an organ donor ? 
I'm in a mushy mood today :p stupid feminine pooh . :o but not like the toast my mom tried to make me eat today ... That was more like a twice-used-abou t-t o-burst-shamwow . x.x If my emotions were as soggy as that toast .. well I'd hafta ask someone to shoot me . xD 
My dad and uncle are both at work ... Sorry guys but it looks like I'll be stranded here . >:/ 
Ugh i hate calling people on the telephone .. I feel like I'm harassing them no matter how dire the situation . I think I'd let myself bleed to death before calling paramedics . I mean they are busy enough without my call right ? :p 
We are supposed to be a team and yet some destroy what we have poured so much effort in to make ? Some people actually love this production , personally I live for OAP ! If we forfeit this year we can't compete for two more years ! No one else in this cast will EVER get another < PROPMALE > . I just want to learn and improve , but I guess I'll just give up learning and trying to make friends . Look at what I'm going through ! FML 
Why is it that the majority of the people with natural talent in any category abuse it , don't care for it , or are total narcissists .... 
Come on lady luck if there was ever a time when I needed you its now . :'( 
Amazing how much you can think alike with someone you aren't even related to . xD 
new pokemon black and white <3 
i can't get ahold of anyone !!! I'm so screwed .. :(((((( why does my dad have to work ? Viar is gonna kill me . 
I'm so freaking happy right now ! I'm saved :') by more than a thread too <3 I promise I'll try way harder this six weeks though . I wonder how everyone else did . :( 
why does everyone own phones they don't answer ? :/ I hate talking on the telephone to but sheesh ever think it might be important ? =.= and who randomly dropped by my house today looking for me ? >___< someone tell me something . 
military ball tonight .. :p 
Tonight was a-MAZING <3 that dj really played EVERYTHING- except < PROPFIRST > bieber , and for that i am eternally grateful . XD 
What time is it ? Its chicken time ! what time is it ? El pollo time ! \ 
Hah that was so out of place it was actually funny . 
ew I HATE spiders !! D:< 
I'm so confused but today was pretty great anyway ! Maybe it is for the better if I have no idea what is going on . o.o 
You know that uncomfortable feeling when you see people competing over something/someone and despise each other but they are still trying to be friendly about it ? -awkward- :/ 
me : Revenge ! REVENGE !! The deed shall not be forgiven nor forgotten ! REVENGEEEEE ! \ 
maxx ; what did he shame your skills as a pokemon trainer ? I mean you have no shame . \ 
Me : -ballistic fury- -wookie cry- REVENGE ! \ 
:p 
< PROPFIRST > trump roast ? I think so ! :D 
Anyone know when Easter is this year ? 
Why does everything have to happen for me in march ? Specifically all next week ! I wish it would be spring break forever ... T^T 
Got a lot to think about ... I guess I'll sleep it off . :/ 
So bored .. >-< but i'll take that over school any day ! 
I hate overbearing parents who keep talons on their children but can't see when they are in distress .. :( even still their are 0apparently the only ones with a suitable cure . jeez lighten up its the modern ages . >__< 
I hate my bedroom being the living room . D: the enlarged space isn't worth the frequent invasion of privacy ! >.> 
I should clean my room , I should also do homework , i should also study , and go over lines ... but sure enough anytime i have plans to do something , my family interferes . :/ 
I now know what death tastes like ... and yet it is so crispy I must conquer it ! x3 
So freakin ' happy !!! i got my test results back and I passed everything with plenty of points to spare ! reading 272/min230 math258/min230 writing 300/min230\ 
On my writing test sample i got a perfect score of 8 ! I only wish i could show my English teacher . :p <3 
I hate being late ! :((( i always feel like I've let everyone down . i need to learn how to drive , and buy a car . D: 
I need a cool cape and a mask ! <3 
I HATE fried food . Every time Eat it , I throw up ! Plus the taste is usually mediocre at best ... Furthermore I hate acid reflux . 
I'm getting really excited for next week .. My prose pieces are gonna be great and I have no worries about spelling either ... The day after is OAP and I can't wait to rack up a win with the awesome cast ! (: Though I don't want to rush this week and waste the time we can spend perfecting this . 
Its been a long day . I wish I could sleep but English won't let me . 
Ugh I hate my brother having company over , its ruined my weekend ! :/

wtd forty notifications ? its the same four over and over again ! Yet another competition tomorrow , i wonder if i can buy my life back on e-bay . 
I did great , and my best , but I got disqualified . If there is anything I've learned this year its that your best isn't enough , and judges have some serious mood swings . :p 
I just sold my mom for a muffin ! xD
