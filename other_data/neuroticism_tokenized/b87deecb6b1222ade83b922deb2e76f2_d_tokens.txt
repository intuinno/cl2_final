And I'm tired of being all alone , and this solitary moment makes me want to come back home Cause I was born to tell you I love you and I am torn to do what I have to , to make you mine Stay with me tonight 
So very proud of my beautiful angel for her dance competitions ! I LOVE YOU !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Went driving for an hour in the neighborhood . Ya know almost having a heart attack because some one is behind me , freaking out when ever a car is in front of me , running a couple of stop signs .... AHHHHHHHHHHH !!!!!!!!!!
