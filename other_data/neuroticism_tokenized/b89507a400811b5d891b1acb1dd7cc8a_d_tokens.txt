I have a website . www.ohaaron.us 
People , Myspace is way better . 
Shablam . Went to the mallio today , fun fun . 
Krakatoa xD 
Hermmm . I am bored , Let me talk your ears off xD 
You are on a flight from Honolulu to Chicago non-stop . There is a fire in the back of the plane . You get enough time to make ONE phone call . Who would you call ? 
Perfection is relative to a standard . 
How come when some people text you you want to throw the phone against the wall , but when other people text you ... you can't set the phone down ? 
What would be harder : for you to tell somebody you love them who you knew didn't love you back or to tell someone who is in love with you , that the feeling is not mutual ? 
Don't cry because it's over . Smile because it happened . 
Lonely . 
I think I am going crazy .. How could this be happening to me ?!?! Good Night . 
Glorious Day ? Maybe ... Guess we will just have to find out .. Jacksonville for the day . 
Hermm ... Some people just don't get it . 
Good Morning Dears . 
Wow . Boredom seems to run at an all time high these days . 
Wow .... ShaneDawson managed to get the word \Sex Cup\ " to number one interest point on twitter . LOL ! People these days xD " 
At least act like you care xD Please ? 
wrote a song last night . \Typical Friday Night . \"" 
You say your fine , I know you better than that . Say whatcha doing with a girl like that ? 
Trust is like a vase .. once it's broken , though you can fix it , the vase will never be the same again . I am sorry . 
Good Day for the most part ! Friends are priceless :) 
May or may not like someone :/ 
Hahah .. fun night . 
I know that we’ll have a ball If we get down And go out And just loose it all I feel stressed out I wanna let it go Lets go way out spaced out And losing all control 
I've been roaming around always lookin ' down at all I see . Painted faces fill the places I can't reach . You know that I could use somebody . Someone like you ..... There are no errors contained in the above lines . If you are wondering what I am talking about , this message doesn't apply to you . xD I hope you are happy now . 
How come there is a fast food restaurant for every type of food except Italian ? 
Sometimes I feel like I don't know what I want . 
I just saved a ton of money on my car insurance by fleeing the leaving the scene of the accident , and I murdered 39 people for a Klondike bar . 
I'd rather be sick than go to the dome :/ I am packing .. ughhh .. 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > better message me or I will chop his face off xD 
My new myspace pic makes me look super emo ... lol check it out . 
Back from the movies . 
Sometimes you wonder .. are they really out there ? 
If you guys have the Farmville ap , would you mind adding me as a neighbor xD I ran out of requests for today and need some more neighbors ! 
Done with hw :) 
Frustrated with life : I am ready for the end of this semester . NO MORE BAND ! I am also sick of being lonely :/ Ugh . BAD DAY ! 
School :/ Fun Fun ? 
Call me obsessive . 
There are moments when I don't know if it's real Or if anybody feels the way I feel I need inspiration Not just another negotiation 
Hates this Ap Bio lab ! 
I did all of my AP Bio Lab 1 Questions except for 2 ! Sleep ! Finally ! 
' s Mom is allowing him to leave marching band :) Now to inform Mr. Smith .. Eeek ! 
I just emailed Mr. Smith ... eeek .. I know I am going to have to talk to him about it tomorrow :( Boo ! 
Have you ever been so lost ? Is there a light , Is there a light ? At the end of the road . I'm pushing everyone away , ' Cause I can't feel this anymore ! Can't feel this anymore . 
Whoover ? Camden County FTW ! 
Anyone watching the VMA's Tonight ? 
I have determined that I am a stalker , considering I am on everyone's fan list . 
Having a good day :) 
Going to bed soon ..... -sigh- If you see me in the hallway tomorrow , and I don't wave or say hi ... punch me ... kk ? 
11 Pages Down , 39 More To Go . Atleast for tonight . I am so bored :/ Ap Bio = Snoozefest ' 09 
I love my friends . <333 
-Sigh- I just don't know anymore ! I need to get out of this town ! 
TGIF ! 
Wow . I am retarded ! 
Sometimes , when one person is missing , the whole world seems depopulated . 
Bleh . I don't feel like being depressed . I refuse to allow myself to bring myself down any further . Does that make sense ? 
Mannn ! Some of these honesty box/google docs responses really make me wonder who sent them ! Gahhhh ! 
We are going to kick some booty tonight . 
Going to the gamee ! I am so ready to win ... My predicted score is going to be 59-7 ... haha ... We will see ... GO WILDCATS ! 
One minute I held the key , Next the walls were closed on me ; and I discovered that my castles stand , Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand . 
LOL ! Someone just tried to argue that IE8 is better than Firefox . Epic Failure . Better at security holes the size of a black hole . 
Camden beats Beach tonight ! Going to the game soon ! :) TGIF ! 
And I can't deny your eyes , You know I try to read between the lines , I saw a warning sign . And then you threw me up against the wall . Who said that it's better to have loved and lost ? I wish that I had never loved at all . 
Saw Zombieland in Jax today , and < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > at our school . I recommend both ! Great day xD 
Sore Throat :( FML 
Got Meh Hurr Did ! 
A single death is a tragedy ; a million deaths is a statistic . 
Too happy for words . 
Psyched for Halloween Horror Nights on Sunday !!! 
I'd Like To make Myself Believe , that Planet earth Turns Slowly . It's Hard To Say That I'd Rather Stay Awake , when I'm Asleep . Cause Everything Is Never As It Seems , When I Fall Asleep . 
Hot n ' Spicy is going to be hilarious ! 
Hot n ' Spicy was great ! Totally hilarious as usual .. 
< PROPFIRST > Lambert's New Song : Time for Miracles is AMAZING ! 
Listening to the new Mayday Parade Album . 
Happy Halloweenie :) 
Who is going to the gameee ? 
The Drama Regionals were fun to watch xD The Bradwell show was hilarious , and the Yellow Boat was awesome . Plus , the second show had a killer Mexican in it ! Overall Conclusion : I can't wait for next year . 
I just lost the game . 
I can't believe we are playing Lowndes in the second round of the playoffs Eff Our Lives . 
, for years , has suffered through the injuries caused by conventional nail clippers ! Lol .. gotta love the Infomercials . 
Anyone going to the game xD ? We are going to eat those fig newtons alive . 
I can't wait for the game tomorrow ... It is certainly going to be a toss up . 
I can't wait for the game tonight . Come out and support , or else . 
Off to the Semi-finals we go ! Go Wildcats ! Watch out North Gwinnett . 
If you are always very far left socially , and moderately right economically .... what does that make you ? Slightly left , or Independent ? 
The 2009 AMA's will be broadcast live on Sunday , November 22 at 8/7c . Make sure you watchh :P 
FML ! Homework :/ 
< PROPFIRST > thinks Camden is up for another State Championship xD 
I just saw the Nightmare Before Christmas for the first time ... it is .... weird haha .. 
I hope everyone has a < PROPFEMALE > Christmas and a Happy New Year . What a Year ... am I right ? Rockin ' it all over again in 2010 xD 
had a wonderful time remembering the old and ushering in the new . I am so grateful for my friends and family , and I look forward to the new memories and experiences that await us in 2011 . \) Happy New Year . " 
You and I left our troubles far behind , but I still have just one more question on my mind . For all my pals who live in the oceans and the seas ; with friends like these well , who needs enemies ? 
You make a puddle look as if it was an ocean . 
Life is getting boring :( School- 99% Life 1% ... Save me ? 
Could anyone who has Ms. Slusser answer a quick question for me , were we supposed to turn in the Book One questions for \A Tale of Two Cities ? \ " I know we were supposed to do the vocab . " 
loves having his license . 
Love the new Facebook design . Simple , Sharp , and Functional . 
In Charleston ! One of my Grandparents neighbors finally got a wireless router , yay for having internet I can steal . :) 
Everyone should go see < PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland , it was mighty beastly . At its current pace , it could gross more than Avatar(It has already beat it in opening weekend , and second weekend gross ) ..... I mean come on , it has < PROPFIRST > Depp . Go see it , NOW ! 
-Insert interesting status here- 
Do any of Ms. McMurray's AP Bio students know which pages we are supposed to outline ? 
A distinct line should be drawn between the who and the what factors of a person's identity . 
Verizon's new ( as of < PROPFIRST > 18th ) 9.99 per month Mandatory data fee if you upgrade your phone is BS . 
can't wait for Universal's Halloween Horror Nights 20th Anniversary this October . <3 
24 1/2 is the magic number . :) You know what I'm talking about . 
Whatever happened to the days when people actually did research ? I'm pretty sure you can't site an e-mail or word of mouth in a research paper . People , check multiple news sources , and don't spread word of mouth until you can cite your source . I'm tired of hearing 50,000 incorrect accounts ( and assumptions ) about every \major\ " event in Camden County . " 
Today marks exactly one month until the last day of school . :) May 18th here we come ! 
I consulted my dictionary on the meaning of love . 
20.5 Days Left of School . Oh , how I beg for it to come faster . I feel so burnt out . 
19.5 more days ! < PROPFEMALE > in there guys . 
18.5 Days . :) 
16.5 Days ! Everyone should take the time to go and see All Shook Up tomorrow or Sunday . It's freaking hilarious . [ Tomorrow 7PM Sun 2PM ] Waffles are nummy . 
Finds a sense of peace in the fact that there are only 14.5 days left of school , even if it means at the moment we have even more projects and homework . It really doesn't seem like the end of the year should be so close . Thank goodness , right ? 
11.5 Days Left of School . 
11.5 Days Left of School . You guys should seriously consider making the ride out to < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > in Jax to see The Laramie Project [ 7:30 PM Tonight / Saturday . ] It was great ! 
This week's evidence that the English Language is doomed : \Shaun Rapid Beckett- if i < PROPFEMALE > see him in gonna kik him supposubly were his nuts are supost to be\ " From the group : \ " I only need 200 men to join to vote < PROPFIRST > Bieber out of our Gender . \"" 
AP testing starts tomorrow . :) I'm so ready to prove that I know this crap and get my credits . xD 11.5 days left of school . 
My best friend is better than yours . 
1.5 days left of school . It can't end fast enough . 
Only half a day left ! 
My mind's thoughts : Summer ! xD I'm a < PROPMALE > . I'm halfway through with high school . End list of thoughts . 
is so bored . 
Boredom : I do know your name . 
-Shoots Self- God , I'm so bored . 
Since it seems that Comcast will be allowed to buy a controlling share into NBC/ Universal ( 51%) I have something to say . 1 ) If the Universal < PROPMALE > Resort falls apart because of this , I will be so freaking angry ! ( Halloween Horror Nights must live on ! ) 2 ) 30 Rock and The Office better be left untouched . Thank you . God , I freaking hate Comcast ! 
I have a new word ! If you are a total nerd , but you act like you're a retard : You . are . a . NETARD ! Thank you , that is all . Like this status if you fit this description . 
2 Camels in a car << Auto-win ! OMGWTFBBQ ! 
Just watched Lady Gaga's new music video for \Alejandro . \ " You can't say she isn't totally original . <3 " 
After waiting for weeks the Halloween Horror Nights- < PROPMALE > website has finally been updated . :) It may just be the teaser site , but that is good enough for me . :) 
likes being able to individually like comments on things ! 
\Lights go out and I can’t be saved\ 
SE < PROPFEMALE > really sucks . :( I'm so sick of this . These next 2 years can't fly by fast enough . 
< PROPFIRST>'s weekend review of movies ! Hit up Knight and Day ! Amazing Romantic Comedy Action Movie ! All 4 of us loved it . Skip Grown Ups . It's predictable , corny , and poorly made . Thanks for reading . :) Of course , if you haven't seen Toy Story 3 yet , you're way behind ! 
If I could write you a song to make you fall in love , I would already have you up under my arm . 
Like this status and I'll leave you a comment on your wall with the first thing that comes to my mind when I see you/ hear your name . 
Hey nature , how would you feel if I suddenly started peeing on you and threatening to shock you with electrical bursts , all while playing screamo loudly into the sky . That's what I thought , take a chill pill . 
made a 5 on his AP BIO & Gov Tests . :) I'm so happy that all of those sleepless nights paid off . 
had a really fun time tonight with < PROPFEMALE > Whitetree & < PROPFEMALE > Simmons . :) We went and saw < PROPFEMALE > , then we talked over breakfast/dinner at Waffle House . 
It's been such a great day , I don't think I could be much happier . :) 
had a great time in Athens/Atlanta . The Explore < PROPFEMALE > program at UGA was quite a treat , and seeing Phantom of the Opera at the Fabulous Fox was amazing . It was a shame that the Braves lost to the Brewers 3-6 , but at least they came back the next day and beat them 11-6 . I'm looking forward to my next college tour @ < PROPMALE > . :) 
\If you are ashamed to stand by your colors 
\Just gonna stand there 
advises those of you who think that engaging in a poke war on Facebook is a good idea to : Just say no . xD It's pretty brutal .

is at airport terminal C9 ! Going to San < PROPMALE > with my best friend < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Labreck 
loves San < PROPMALE > & California in general . Watching cops and laying on the couch . 
is chilly because it's 60 degrees in San < PROPMALE > . 
going to Los < PROPFEMALE > later today . \) I can't wait ! I love this place ( California for you slow ones ;) ! ) " 
is catching his red-eye flight home from San < PROPMALE > at 10:55 PM PST tomorrow . It's been a wonderful vacation . 
just touched down at JAX . 
woke up from his nap to the elimination of Prop8 being texted to his cell phone via a civil rights group , WIN ! I can't believe it happened the day I left Cali . 
thinks that sending death threats online is a very immature thing to do , and only makes you seem less intelligent than you actually are ( if that's possible . ) 
is going to purchase a parking sticker for zone 2 ( I hope , ) and get his hair cut/colored today . 
suffers from chronic boredom and needs to < PROPFEMALE > out with someone . :P 
thinks that the quote below is very inspirational . \ 
\Never fear shadows . They simply mean there's a light shining somewhere nearby . \ " \ 
had a great time at < PROPFEMALE > Phillips ' party . < PROPFEMALE > Whitetree , < PROPFEMALE > Victoriano , < PROPFEMALE > Horton , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Berrie , and I suppose < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Labreck are the coolest people ever . 
< PROPFIRST > Shinn needs to stop poking me , or I'm going to poke him in the eye . I'm just sayin ' . 
knows that most of us strive for perfection , but every once in a while someone comes along who appears to not have to try at all . 
snacks on chips and salsa repeatedly . Does anyone else have this addiction ? 
is officially in love with the musical stylings of < PROPMALE > Mars . All of his songs are so original & catchy , and his voice is fantastic ... for some reason it makes me nostalgic . 
thinks that since my mom is going out tonight and tomorrow night , I need to find something to do .... It's pretty sad when your mom has more plans for the weekend than you . 
thinks that Salt is a really good movie , and would recommend it to those of you who haven't seen it yet . Talk about action packed . 
is a-brewin ' freshly ground Starbucks coffee . xD 
Imagine what it would be like if we played a team like Miami Central every week .... 
can't stand one word text replies . In a world where technology reins supreme , I don't understand how people can expect a reply to such a short message . It's like they are offended when I don't .... What am I supposed to say to \ok\ " or \ " haha ? \"" 
Bahaha , who tagged my car windows ? You guys are dorks . \P " 
had gratuitous amounts of fun at < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Labreck's 18th birthday party ! 
about to upload the pictures from last night , hopefully none of you are too offended . :P I did my best to get rid of the ones that people would be mad about . xD 
is tired of the lies . I'd rather hear a thousand hurtful truths than a couple dirty lies . 
Does anyone know the answer to this ? The sp2 hybrid orbital is found in carbon ____ bonds . I have no idea . 
Someone should def . ride the fanbus with me to the St. Thomas Acqinas game . 
\Hot ' n ' Cold\ " comes to mind . " 
80 of my friends \like the Twilight Saga . \ " Suicide is the only option at this point . " 
Best thing ever to do for an exam that you're going to fail ? \72 : Get three of your friends to dress up in red robes with crosses . Have them wait outside the class until you get the test and say “I though I was taking a test . I wasn’t expecting the Spanish Inquisition . ” Then have your friends run in yelling ” NOBODY EXPECTS THE SPANISH INQUISITION ! ” . Try do do this with other < PROPMALE > Python gags to mix things up . \"" 
finally has his hotel/ticketing/express pass arrangements taken care of for Halloween Horror Nights on October 23rd . :) I'm so excited ! 
is so excited for the Camden County High School vs . St. < PROPFIRST > Aquinas High School game . Go ' cats ! 
loves Fall . Have you seen how wonderful it is outside ? My favorite month , my favorite holiday , my favorite season .... it doesn't get much better than Fall . 
So , after some help from a friend , I've finally located our football team's website : http://www.camdenwildcatfootball.com/ . As you can see , it could use quite a bit of work if it's going to compare to the sites I posted yesterday ( check my profile . ) The text on the site is hardly even visible ( it's so blurry ! ) At least it's up-to-date .. but it doesn't even have our teams accomplishments on it . Action time ! 
At least Camden is still ranked in the top 25 , I have to think that they knew we were the best in < PROPFEMALE > ( they put us immediately in front of North Gwinnett . ) 
Yes , please upload pictures of you and your significant other with your tongues halfway down each other's throat .... that's what we want to see on Facebook , right ? 
lol 
had a delicious meal at Buca di Beppos and spent time in the Avenues Mall for my brother's 24th birthday . \) " 
hates being frustrated with circumstances that aren't likely to change . 
is going to Halloween Horror nights with his Best Friend and Family very very soon . :) I'm so excited ! 
is tired of all of this . All of this negativity , unrest , and flat out ugliness is so uncalled for . Half of the content on Facebook is nothing but hate for the sake of hating . Is it really such a naive mind-set to believe that maybe people could just make an effort to retain some of those thoughts for the sake of < PROPFEMALE > ? Obviously all conflict can't be avoided , but people are so petty these days . 
Suck it Florida fans , < PROPFEMALE > is going to win ! \P " 
I vote that our class motto should be : \Class of 2012 : They saved the best for last . \"" 
Please , join this group : http://www.facebook.com/pages/Cheyenne-Whitetree-must-go-to-UGA/166567086706206?v=info

Camden currently has 29 former players playing at the college level . Insane ? http://blogs.ajc.com/georgia-high-school-sports/2010/11/02/list-current-college-players-produced-by-each-georgia-high-schools/?cxntfid=blogs_georgia_high_school_sports 
Just finished his APUSH HW , Darned Procrastination . Sleep , here I come ! 
Apparently I lied to my Chem . Classmates , she just put in a 100 for the Icee Lab : meaning that you do not have to do those problems . Sorry ! 
just saw Secretariat , it was excellent ! 
is excited for the first round of the playoffs . & so it begins ... to the dome !

<3 Verizon's new tiered data packages . Smart phones with data plans starting at $15.00 a month , for those of us who aren't data hogs . If you are , the $30.00 unlimited plan is still available . Thank goodness for consumers having options . 
Firefox 4.0 - Replacing Chrome 8 for now ... bum bum bummmm . 
Needs the advice of someone who's taken Health Occupations 3 ( Nursing Essentials with Clinicals . ) Please contact me in some way , or just let me know you've taken it . 
Going on a stroll to the park . \) " 
Watching the AMAs . 
On second thought , rather than make a big deal about calling in and trying to get a rematch , I think it would be more beneficial to the sport to implement instant official review during the playoffs . Technology has become such a staple on our lives , it's ridiculous to not allow for challenges , which would take 2 minutes to review , and eliminate any feelings of being cheated afterwards . 
has asked for a Droid 2 for Christmas . xD 
Facebook is getting too intrusive ; it is time for the next big thing . #Facebooksucks 
So I'm really curious what everyone's favorite Christmas song is ... care to share ? Mine is \Wonderful Christmas Time . \ " :) " 
Loves his Droid2 ! 
So I have been asking people if they wear \So Cal\ " all day long : everywhere I went I smelled pure heaven ... I just discovered I had a tester strip in my pocket . " 
Dear < PROPFEMALE > Whitetree , < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Labreck , < PROPFEMALE > Simmons , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Berrie , < PROPFEMALE > Victoriano , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Boeckel , and all of my other friends who make everyday unique .. I just wanted to let you guys know that you're incredible . Also , this list is alphabetized and incomplete .. so I'll go ahead and apologize . <3 
has had an amazing break thus far . Friday night was indescribable , and spending the day at Town Center was quite excellent . I'm def . looking forward to the rest of this break . 
Eeeeep , 10 minutes . 
Thank you so much for the Birthday wishes everyone . I had an amazing day , thanks to all of you . 
has now listened to \F ? #&*N ' Perfect\ " by Pink 4 times in a row . :/ " 
didn't know there was such thing as a spectacular Monday . \) " 
had his parking sticker stolen today . Are there any decent people out there who still have a conscience ? I'm starting to lose hope .
