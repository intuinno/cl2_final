Done ... 
If I could have my wasted days back , would I use them to get back on track ? Stop to warm at < PROPFEMALE>'s burning , or look ahead but keep on turning . 
Life it seems will fade away , drifting farther everyday . Getting lost within myself , nothing matters , no one else 
I don't know how to live through this hellWoken up , I'm still locked in this shellFrozen soul , frozen down to the coreBreak the ice , I can't take anymore 
I'll be on in a bit :D Playing a little Crossfire 
Eh ... 
You and me will all go down in history , With a sad Statue of < PROPFEMALE > , And a Generation that didn't agree . 
For a hill men would kill why they do not know , Stiffened wounds test there pride , Men of five still alive through the raging glow , gone insane from this pain that they surely know ! For Whom the < PROPFEMALE > Tolls , Time marches on , For Whom the < PROPFEMALE > Tolls 
Count lies like sheep to the rhythm of the war drums 
Great nations built from the bones of the dead , With mud and straw , blood and sweat , You know your worth when your enemies Praise your architecture of aggression 
Time and Again .. She repeats , let's be friends .. I smile and say yes .. Another truth bends .. 
Summer can't come quickly enough .. Lol 
Eh .. I suppose I'll go see what everyone is up to :P 
Hmm ... I'm not sure yet 
Finals are over :D

Can you see there's a little spot of light in me ?........... Can you see , can you tell I'm FUCKED !!! 
The sham-wow guy in prison ... fantastic 
Yep . It went well I think . Ask me about it if you want , Lol 
What's everyone doing this week ? 
Ok so I just saw a picture of me from last summer . Completely made this day 100x better . TAG ME IN IT < PROPMALE > !!!! 
Rewatching Deathnote : D 
\There is a 5% < PROPMALE > that you are Kira\ " -L " 
Emily .... why ? \ 
Maybe you missed a few preschool classes , but this is not how you make friends ... 
Just got done watching Advent Children with < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > 
just drank an amp and can't sleep 
How I wish ... How I wish you were here ... 
Apparently now I have to walk to < PROPFIRST>'s house for waffles ... lmao 
Look left , look right , but I'm behind you .. 
Feels like this week has gone fast . Idk , anyways this weekend should be fun 
To hide behind ... The mask this time ... And try to believe ... 
Am I really such a bad person ? People keep referring to me as \Satan\ " ... Maybe they're right " 
Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel , Is just the freight train coming your way ...... 
BANZAI ! 
Pay no mind to the distant thunder ... beauty fills his head with wonder , boy ! 
Where's your crown < PROPMALE > Nothing ? 
No more can they keep us in ... \ 
Listen , Dammit ! We will win ! 
So ... I'm hoping that everyone cheers up soon . It sucks because I can't seem to help anyone ... 
Finished the Marchen for < PROPMALE > , now I'm going to sleep : P 
I AM REALLY EXCITED !! 
I've got a lot on my mind ... hmm 
Argh ... Finished my essay for Rohr ( Finally ! ) and now I'm exhausted . I'm also extremely relieved , but I'll feel even better on Thursday , when all this stress and anxiety is gone : \\ 
666-Supadupafly LISTEN TO IT TECHNO FANS 
Well , I'm about to start working soon . Could be as early as Tuesday . I hope my wrist heals by then , it's hurts like HELL ! Idk wtf I did ... lol 
You can put a man on trial , but you can't make the guilty pay ... You can cage an animal , but you can't take away the rage ... 
Console yourself , you're better alone , \ 
Destroy yourself , see who gives a fuck , \ 
Absorb yourself , you're better alone , \ 
Destroy yourself . 
Went to the pool , then played ninja with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > . I lost ... : P 
Got no sleep . 
More Drama ? Really now , and I was just in a good mood too ... 
I've done nothing but game this weekend ... tomorrow let's all do something outside ! 
What the fuck ... 
Last week of this shit ... finally 
Just got off work . This shit is gonna be tiring , but none of you will recognise me in a couple of months . My supervisor says that he's seen people like me drop 20 pounds in the first two weeks on the load wall . 
Counting on me , always hoping I'll be , there for all of your problems in turn you're never there for me ... You sucked the life out of me , you hate everything you see , I always stay when I should leave ... 
They think we're all the same\ 
And always we're to blame\ 
For shit I think is lame \ 
It's time to stop the game \ 
I think it's time to pay for everything you made me say 
Boom boom boom boom 
so ... about 500 packages , 6 feet long and 2.5 feet wide , each one weighing 60lbs , in 2 hours . That's 500 x 60 , which is 30,000 lbs . I am tired ... 
Leave me alone 
they think they've got me all figured out ... 
People ... they're always in my way 
Wake me up or let me sleep forever 
Going to work ... lol\ 
Donivan's older brother is my trainer , if anyone was wondering ; )\ 
Funny stuff man , funny stuff 
I feel the reason as it's leaving me , No not again ... 
Running out of ways to run\ 
I can't see , I can't be\ 
Over and over . and under my skin\ 
All this attention is doing me in 
I felt the hate rise up in me\ 
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves\ 
I wander out where you can't see\ 
Inside my shell I wait and bleed 
But my dreams , they aren't as empty\ 
As my conscience seems to be\ 
I have hours , only lonely\ 
My love is vengeance , that's never free ... 
I can't control my shakes\ 
How the hell did I get here ? \ 
Something about this so very wrong ... \ 
I have to laugh out loud\ 
I wish I didn't like this\ 
Is it a dream or a memory ... 
Have you ever wondered why , In a dream you can touch a fallen sky , and fly to the heavens that watch over you , telling me it's all voodoo .... voodoo too 
Haha I has idea ! ^.^ 
The verdict is GUILTY ! 
No oasis here to see , The sand is singing deathless words to me ... 
Falling into this place , Just giving you a small taste , of your afterlife here so stay , you'll be back here soon anyways 
Such a surreal place to see , So how did this come to be ? \ 
Arrived too early 
What the fuck ... This is going to be a shitty summer to top off a shitty year . Great . Can't I get ONE FUCKING THING to look forward to ? 
Blacken the cursed Sun , You're not the only one , To have sunk so far and low , there is no tomorrow 
Haha that helped a lot . Feeling much better now gonna play some LoL and < PROPFEMALE > out w/ < PROPFIRST > all night . Hopefully work tomorrow will be better 
You can tell the same lie a thousand times , but it never gets anymore true\ 
So close your eyes once more and once more believe that they all still believe in you 
I wanted you to know , That I love the way you laugh\ 
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain away\ 
Because I'm broken , When I'm lonesome\ 
And I don't feel right , When you've gone away 
So what if you can see , \ 
The darkest side of me , \ 
No one will ever change this animal I have become . \ 
Help me believe , \ 
It's not the real me , \ 
Somebody help me tame this animal I have become . 
My eyes are open wide\ 
By the way ... I made it through the day 
Going to Shooters with some people . 
Won 1 game , Lost 2\ 
Fun night 
My hardest question to answer is why ... 
The more the dark consumes me , I pretend that I'm burning bright 
Just to clarify , most of the stuff I post are lyrics to whatever song I happen to be listening to 
I am all , but what am I ? \ 
Another number that isn't equal to any of you 
AYYYY YAAAHHHHH ! 
Techno sort of mood =_= 
Sanctity a breath away .... \ 
Just a breath away .. 
No one cares about climbing stairs\ 
Nothing at the top no more 
Ugh so tired ... 
Haha I know it's far away , but I can't wait for Halloween : D 
Someone falls to pieces , Sleepin all alone\ 
Someone kills the pain ... \ 
Spinning in the silence , To finally drift away ... \ 
Someone gets excited , In a chapel yard\ 
Catches a bouquet ... \ 
Another lays a dozen , White roses on a grave ... 
why do you < PROPMALE > it ? \ 
what can it bring you ? \ 
it can’t be had ... \ 
the secret hides in living 
It makes us worry , and takes our dreams\ 
Sometimes it's the enemy , or so it seems 
You'll never know why your face has haunted me , \ 
My very soul has to bleed this time , \ 
Another hole in the wall of my inner defenses , \ 
Leaving me breathless , the reason I know , \ 
That I am stricken and can't let you go , \ 
When the heart is cold , there's no hope , and we know , \ 
That I am crippled by all that you've done , \ 
Into the abyss will I run ... 
Tyrant , I'll burn you down 
Smile and Destroy it 
The city looks so pretty , \ 
Do you want to burn it with me ? 
I am Stricken\ 
and can't let you go 
Like my status and I'll tell you what I like about you , what I don't like , and my first impression . 
fuck it all 
Living just isn't hard enough\ 
Burn me alive inside\ 
Living my life's not hard enough\ 
So take everything away 
I'm bored as hell =_= 
Show me how to lie\ 
You're getting better all the time 
Es wohnt in mich , und in dich . \ 
Es wohnen in uns , in die Herzens < PROPMALE > Männern . \ 
Es ist hassen und wut . Und es wird verbrauchen dich . 
Open door so I walk inside\ 
Close my eyes , find my place to hide\ 
And I shake as I take it in\ 
Let the show begin ;) 
Uhm ... 89 degrees with 90% Humidity ... \ 
And I got to work ... fml 
St. < PROPFIRST > greets with empty eyes then turns and locks the gate 
Don't hold me up , now\ 
I can stand my own ground\ 
I don't need you help , now\ 
You will let me down , down , down 
How about a better version of the way that I am\ 
How about a better version that makes me understand\ 
The way I look , the way I speak\ 
How about a better version of me ? 
Fallen and falling 
What's everyone doing today ? Hit me up 
I am Darkness , I am Night\ 
I am Vengeance , I bring Light\ 
I'm a winter breeze in summer time\ 
The world is broken , I'm just fine\ 
Looking day and living night\ 
I'm alright 
There is nothing in the world that can change my mind 
Promises have been turned to lies\ 
Can't even be honest inside\ 
Now I'm running backwards\ 
Watching my life wave me goodbye 
When people are treated like animals their whole lives , they act like animals . \ 
When they are not respected , they have no respect for themselves . When they act out , we treat them worse . Treat people with respect , show them kindness . In return , those people won't grow up with no self esteem and become druggies , murderers and prostitutes . This is not a hard concept , so why does everyone have trouble with it ? 
To truly live you must embrace the things you fear . We think we know so much but we have no idea 
They say when it rains it pours ... 
I don't understand why half of my friends even talk to me =_= 
is not looking forward to work 
I completely forgot how fucking amazing the show Full Metal Alchemist was . So I'm watching it again . 
Nature does not care whether you can describe a phenomenon by an equation . It just manifests them . 
Work tonight . Again ... lol 
Fuck it all 
God I'll make them pay , \ 
Take it back some day , \ 
I'll end this day , \ 
I'll splatter color on this gray . 
Oh damn o.O \ 
Just discovered immortality LOL 
I wanted you to know , that I love the way you laugh\ 
I want to hold you high and steal your pain away\ 
Because I'm broken , when I'm lonesome\ 
and I don't feel right when you've gone away 
I won't let caution or doubt get in my way anymore . 
Diving down ... round and round ... 
Did I ask too much ? \ 
More than a lot . \ 
You gave me nothing , \ 
Now it's all I've got 
Why does everyone feel like my enemy\ 
Don't want any part of depression or darkness\ 
No , I've had enough , sick and tired\ 
Bring the sun , or I'm gone\ 
Or I'm gone .. 
If your body matches what your eyes can do\ 
You'd probably move right through me on my way to you . 
Today has been strange . Not bad , not great , just strange . 
I'm not pissed off for once . Deal with it xD 
Well world , what else you gonna toss at me ? 
Canada is only there until they do something we don't like\ 
I'd like to see them start a fight someday\ 
We'd probably beat them to the ground by 6 am 
A sniper takes a life\ 
The doctor saves one\ 
The bum wastes his \ 
same as the < PROPMALE > man\ 
chasing what they do not want\ 
what they didn't need 
All these thoughts , they make no sense . 
Running out of ways to run . 
I'm not paralyzed , but I seem to be struck by you . 
You always find a way to keep me right here waiting . 
Help me I don't know what I'm saying\ 
Sometimes this tongue can be betraying\ 
And if I'm wrong , is that such a crime ? \ 
And if you want , you can set my words to right 
Haha hard to believe it was 90 degrees on Monday . 
Let's all go to work . Yay .... funnnnn 
No one cares , ' bout climbin stairs\ 
Nothing at the top no more . 
I sit here locked inside my head\ 
Remembering everything you said\ 
The silence gets us nowhere ... \ 
Gets us nowhere ... way too fast 
School was ok . Time to go to work ... yay ? 
Anyone have Ms. Francek for Writing for the 21st Century ? I need the stupid questions . 
Another day I'll never get back .... haha 
Why does everyone feel like my enemy ? 
You know when you feel full of energy all day , then the exhaustion kind of creeps up on you ? Yea ... 
I love caffeine . I can't stop smiling xD 
Eating some chicken strips ... LIKE A BOSS ! 
It's been awhile , since I could hold my head up high ... \ 
And it's been awhile , since I've said I'm sorry ... 
If I offer you my soul , will you < PROPFEMALE > me away ? \ 
I can not be the only one , to be dehumanized again ... \ 
left behind . 
I've got some imperfections , \ 
But how can you collect them all\ 
and throw them in my face .. 
Well what I really want to say , I can't define 
Not sure how I'm supposed to do this < PROPMALE > homework . Where do I go to hear the listening stuff ? 
Opinions change ... as do people 
What the hell happened to me ? 
I hope this name thing works ... I could use a good laugh 
Slippin into oblivion . 
Too much caffeine is NOT good . 
I'm spinning , but in a good way I think . 
Scatter with the wind\ 
Let instinct be your guide\ 
Let go of reason\ 
and just enjoy the ride 
I think ... I'm gonna walk 
Hahaha hahahahahahahhahahahahah aaaahahahahahahah xD 
Hollow inside\ 
Cracking outside\ 
Can you tell a real smile\ 
From my hollow one ? \ 
Do you even know the difference ? 
I'm not blind\ 
I'm not deaf\ 
Is it so hard to believe\ 
I'm telling the truth ? 
So I dub thee Unforgiven 
Dammit ... 
Hmm ... guess this week is gonna suck . A lot . 
Buttered toast is just like a candle . 
Thanks for all your help . You know who you are ... and I hope you know I appreciate it . 
feeling kind of strange . 
I create another day\ 
You'll be gone tomorrow \ 
Lie to me ... \ 
You're Faceless 
I stand alone\ 
Inside ... I\ 
Stand alone 
I could be weak\ 
I could be senseless\ 
You know I could be just \ 
like You 
It never was enough\ 
And the world is what I gave to you\ 
~ Black < PROPFEMALE > by Hollywood Undead 
< PROPFEMALE > it with you till someone forgives you , \ 
I laugh cuz ' there's nothing to say 
I need to get the hell out of here for awhile . 
Label me , that's fine .... I'll be somebody else 
Just take a little bit off the top\ 
I don't care , just make it STOP ! 
Hard to speak today ... I can think of shit to say just can't seem to make my mouth form the words ... Guess I'm just that tired . 
1 ; 2 ;3 ; 4 ; 5 ; 6 ; 6 ; 6 ; 
..................................... ( Silence ) 
Ugh ...... 
The higher you are ... The farther you fall ... The longer the walk .... The farther you crawl .... My body , my < PROPFEMALE > .... This < PROPFEMALE > it tilts ... Step into the house that < PROPFIRST > built 
Ugh .... so damn tired .... 
Meh ... I just don't know right now . 
You're better off empty and blank\ 
The left with a single , pathetic trace of this 
Going for a looooong walk 
I can't tell you what it is I can only tell you what it feels like\ 
and right now it's a steel knife in my windpipe . 
This is the face that stones you cold\ 
This is the moment that needs to breathe\ 
These are the claws that scratch these wounds\ 
This is the pain that never leaves\ 
This is the tongue that whips you down\ 
This is the burden of every man\ 
These are the screams that pierce your skin\ 
This is the voice of silence no more 
Snap back to reality ... 
Just keep bending ' till I break 
Sing with me , sing for the years , sing for the laughter , sing for the tears . 
So you think you can tell\ 
Heaven from Hell\ 
Blue skies from pain\ 
Can you tell a green field\ 
From a cold steel rail\ 
A smile from a veil\ 
Do you think you can tell 
Happy birthday brother . 
Possibly the greatest picture ever taken . 
Feel the tension in the air ? Something is gotta break soon . 
Hey I just realized why most songs are depressing or angry . Because nothing rhymes with happy that isn't stupid . 
I'm gonna change what you call rage . 
Anyone wanna do anything ? I'm fucking bored 
For all those looking down at me , fuck you , I'm tearing down your balcony 
LIKE my status and I'll tell you : \ 
1 . Something I've learned about you from looking at your WALL\ 
2 . The color you remind me of\ 
3 . My first memory with you\ 
4 . The animal you remind me of ... \ 
5 . Ask you something I've always wondered about you\ 
6 . My favorite thing about you\ 
7 . Challenge you to repost this 
We'll walk this road together , through the storm , whatever weather , cold or warm , Just to let you know that you're not alone 
Why ... 
Awesome . Let's see ... \ 
Pain in my legs , head , back , and neck all bordering on horrific\ 
Don't even get me started on the pain in my chest 
< PROPMALE > Cobain heh ... \ 
Hopefully I don't go out like him though 
Don't lose any sleep tonight\ 
I'm sure everything will end up alright 
I'm bored lol 
........................................... All we have is these dots ............................. 
This sucks ... 
Yes , I did just seriously make that my profile picture . 
My rage has just begun . Sit back and get comfortable . 
Doesn't want to go to work today ... =_= 
You will be missed < PROPFEMALE > . 
Anybody else wake up wondering if it was all a bad dream ....? 
That was weird ... 
People won't leave my sweatshirt alone ... haha 
You're so independent \ 
You just refuse to bend\ 
So I keep bending ' til I break ... 
Happy Halloween\ 
Our nightmares come alive ... \ 
( Mischievous laughter ) xD 
All those who look down on me , I'm tearing down your balcony .

That's flowing through you ? 
They think we're all the same \ 
And always we're to blame \ 
For shit I think is lame \ 
Greetings from Siberia , Damn it's cold 
Just < PROPFIRST > an awesome Jack-in-the-Box . Pretty sweet xD 
I tried so hard , and got so far\ 
But in the end , it doesn't even matter\ 
I had to fall , To lose it all ... \ 
It doesn't even matter 
Mayuri Kurotsuchi = Win

I'll beat , the demons , that drag me down 
I WANT SOME WINKLEPICKERS LMAO 
Make me believe\ 
That this place isn't plagued\ 
By the poison in me ... 
Memoria 
Light my candles , in a daze\ 
' Cause I've found God 
I am thankful for my friends . I'm thankful for my family , my job , my life . I'm thankful that I have people who are willing to listen to me , even when I'm making no sense . Thank you . 
Great day with the gang xD

When you turn black 
I'm so happy\

Shooter's was bomb 
Strangely reminiscent . 
I'm ok , just go away\ 
Into distance let me fade\ 
I'm ok , but please don't stray too far ... 
More than Evil\ 
I laugh at your trust 
Friday :D 
In their wretched guts all they want is to feed\ 
Unending , covetous hunger known as greed 
Don't let them take you down\ 
You'll leave a better\ 
world than you found 
In my eyes , indisposed\ 
In disguises no one knows\ 
Hides the face , lies the snake\ 
And the sun in my disgrace 
Peace sells , but who's buying ? 
WEEEEWWWTTT Goodbye Peak Season !!!! 
I've got some imperfections , \ 
but how can you collect them all\ 
and throw them in my face 
Face away and pretend that I'm not 
I'm back lol 
None of this matters , we're only dreaming 
What do you mean I can't be the president of the United States of America ? \ 
Tell me something , it's still we , the people ... right ? 
I call all the shots , all wins no losses\ 
Follow me I'm the boss of all bosses 
This is the last time that I kneel and pray to the sky\ 
Cause almost everything that I was always ever told was a lie 
I walk the thin line between Einstein and < PROPFIRST > Manson 
Mother fuckers made me out of self-righteous hatred\ 
Now you've got yourself a virus , stuck in the matrix 
My thoughts rip through armored plates then start to resonate 
Wracked with nostalgia 
Currently fascinated by chemistry and quantum mechanics :D 
Work's got me heated :\\ 
That could NOT have gone worse 
About to let out my lions like Jumanji 
You gave me nothing\ 
I'm already planning your downfall :D \ 
Don't kid yourself 
Hurtling sideways down tendrils of thought 
I've come to wreck and guide you 
I run through the world , thinkin ' bout tomorrow 
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail\ 
Follow the god that failed 
Rest in peace brother . It's been 2 years today but the memories never fade . 
Refuse , resist , war is my < PROPFEMALE > \ 
Disorder unleashed , war is my < PROPFEMALE > 
Come as you are , \ 
As you were , \ 
As I wanted you to be 
Bored as fuck anyone tryna kick it ? 
Take a step into my world 
Kickin it at < PROPFIRST>'s for a bit 
Haha told you guys the Packers were gonna stomp the Bears . 14-0 at halftime 35-7 is my predicted final score . 
Watching Full Metal Alchemist : Brotherhood all day . So .... day successful 
Into the abyss of subconscious ... away I go haha\ 
Goodnight Facebook 
You think this is over ? Oh no , we've just begun . 
Rawr ! Just got off of work and I'm super energetic for some reason o , O 
You can't survive in my shoes\ 
Or afford to pay my dues 
I must confess that I feel like a monster 
Help me I don't know what I'm doing\ 
Help me before I fall to ruin\ 
And If I'm blind , I will lead you on\ 
Come follow me now , before our time is gone 
Drama is so frustrating ..... 
Just like the Pied < PROPFEMALE > \ 
Led rats through the streets\ 
We dance like marionettes\ 
Swaying to the Symphony of Destruction 
Boredom 
Today should be pretty good 
Dead I am the one\ 
Exterminating son\ 
Slipping through the trees\ 
Strangling the breeze 
Are you ready ? No ? Too bad haha xD 
Gather your pathetic masses and bring them to me\ 
To a world devoid of light\ 
To another time and another place\ 
And the broken ones will taste my misery 
People need to learn to shut there god damn mouths . Quit vomiting up whatever happens to be on your mind , I don't fucking care enough to listen anymore . 
Hahaha ok Eagan , give me a 4 day weekend . 
\They say death is beautiful and necessary\ 
I'm urban warfare through the streets of your psychology . 
Universal truth isn't measured in mass appeal . 
God dammit .... I hate my stupid alarm 
This warm weather is making me ridiculously happy . I forgot how much I hate being inside 
gonna be a good day 
You take a mortal man\ 
And put him in control\ 
Watch him become a god\ 
Watch people's heads roll 
I was an angel before a third of the stars fell 
Wewt 3 days off ! 
Today was fun ... time for bed 
Damn my computer is out of commission yet again . I need to stop breaking power cords lol 
Me do this one all by my lonely 
Damn I got way too much shit to accomplish =_= 
My cup runneth over .
