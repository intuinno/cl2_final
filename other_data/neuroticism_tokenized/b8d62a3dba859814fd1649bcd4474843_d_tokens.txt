Hey , Facebook looks better than MySpace ! 

gosh , i just wanna freaggin Spartan kick somebody one day XD 
Haha , Hideki thinks I have nice body XD 
I bet Nike's droppin Tiger Woods next ... 14 women !? I know Thai cultures ok with 2 or 3 , but he ain't no < PROPMALE > ! 
Shiny ! 
I can't believe it's over ... \It's a Wonderful Life . \ " I'll never forget that ! " 
is < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > the same as < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > ? shoot , it's hard to type after boxing XD 
Stressin over Brown Bags , God help me . 
About to go SUPER SAIYAN !!! 
Just came home from Brown Bags to Stardom concert . Mixed emotions , sure it's great to win 2nd place , but without CJ ? It's not right , I got some bad juju right now . Plus , the performance was terrible , I < PROPMALE>' even know how I placed . I'm sorry overall for not glorifying God well enough . 
I'm SUPA glad and thankful for everyone that showed up , though . You all supported me even though I did junk , I love you all !!! 
brown bags to stardom was boss , i'm glad i can relax . 2nd place , thank you God ! 
So ... Senior Sneak-Off , any guess on where we're going ??? 
Hawaiian < PROPFIRST>'s was the last place I thought we'd go ! A very pleasant surpirse , I must say . Had to be the best Sneak-off < PROPFEMALE > ! 
I just divided by zero ... 
Judo season started everyone ! Be sure to join before March , Aiea judo team is going to the top of the division this season ( Lord willing ) , we need all the help we can get ! 
Lolz , got accepted to LCC , underachieving in process XD Nah , I'm broke , what do you expect ? Btw , Happy belated birthday to < PROPMALE > Marley , see c/o 2010 at PacBeaHot tonight for Banquet !!! 
Double leg shot , it feels great ! 
I say , Colts 23 , Saints 17 ... sorry RJ ... XP 
Give me a week to put up the Senior Banquet stuffs . 
\Shots Shots Shots Shots Shots Shots Shots Shots Shots Shots Shots Shots Shots Shots Shots Shots \"- Remind me again how they make money for this ??? I guess it's the crazy beat . " 
Please forgive me , Senior Banquet vids can't go up for a bit , I'm supa busy and so is my brother . The only way I can upload is with his computer ... so ... 2 more days ? 
How do you build judo and perpetuate it if you eliminate wrestling and groundwork ? I see ... the yudanshakai know they're better than our stupid little games , and instead of working to beat stronger opponents like Jigoro Kano did , we go to the flash of it all like the Olympics . News flash : you can submit people in Olympics , you can pin , and can pick legs . Who the hell are we modeling ? 
Why does < PROPFEMALE > laugh when < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > kicks him in the end of Enter the Dragon ...? I think it would hurt to be hit that hard , eh ? 
:v •••••••••••••••• : putnam : ••••••••••••••••••••••• (^^^) Put this in an IM ... 
The LORD is my shepherd , I shall not want . He makes me lie in green pastures ; he leads me beside still waters . He restores my soul , He leads me in the path of righteousness for His Name's sake . Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death , I shall fear no evil ; for you are with me , your < PROPMALE > and your staff , they comfort me ... Goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life .

Everyone that I apparently chat-hacked , let's all sign out now ! It's a chain hack , continues with participation in the chat box . The longer you take , the more damage it could do 
My God is HUGE ! Even as a human ... Hello ? CARPENTER !? \My God could beat up your god . \"- I think < PROPMALE > Cook said that XD " 
The triangle ... it can be the lamest instrument , the shape with choke rules and proofs , or the beastiest choke ever . Hmm , decisions , decisions ...? I'll leave this up to < PROPFIRST > Brown 
We encounter brick walls in life . Some people try to get around it , but then get lost . Some people try to climb it , but give up even though the only thing stopping them is their mind . Has anyone tried digging a tunnel underneath ? Sure , you'll get dirty and it is hard work , but then you're laying the path for others to follow .
