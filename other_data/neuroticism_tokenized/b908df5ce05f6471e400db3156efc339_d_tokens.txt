< PROPFIRST > quote of the day .... I'm all soft and squishy like a meatloaf sandwich ... 
Jez , I clicked on the cannon video from a few comment back and it worked . Watch and laugh . :p 
The night is calling me . I want to start driving , only stopping when < PROPFEMALE > breaks to sleep a bit and do it again .... 
3 days left ' till moving time . Oh the joy .... 
Moving sucks , but with Dumb and Dumber as movers the laughs were worth what I paid . 
I have a new number . It is 1034 . Why is this important you ask . It isn't . It has absolutely no importance to anyone but me and means nothing at all except that it is new and I like . Hmm ... I also happen to enjoy making people quirk their brows as they go WTF ? So I guess my new number does have meaning after all . 
“He’s not one of us . If you gave him a gun and told him he had two choices—“shoot\ 
one of your dogs or shoot yourself”—he’d put the gun to\ 
his ear and pull the trigger . ”\ 
\ 
“Hell , you’d do the same if someone did that to you\ 
and your damned cats . ”\ 
“No , people like us , we’re third-option people . We take the gun , \ 
stuff it in the person’s mouth , and eliminate the problem . Walk off into\ 
the sunset with our kitty ... \ " , 2010-11-01 06:31:58 "

So , let me get this straight Charlie Sheen can make a “porn family” , < PROPFEMALE > Grammar can end a 15 year marriage over the phone , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > can be on divorce #9 , < PROPFEMALE > Spears had a 55 hour marriage , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > and Tiger Woods , while married , were having sex with EVERYONE . Yet , the idea of same-sex marriage is going to destroy the institution of marriage ? Really ? 
Sorry to all , I clicked the link ... 
Busiest day of the week , working by myself and I got the hare-brained idea to start cleaning the facility . \ 
I'm EXHAUSTED ... 
Took DB bowling last night . He was so excited couldn't get him to sleep . 10pm I thought he was down , no . 11:30 ... no . 3am was sure he was out it was safe for bed . He pops out of his room , \I had a nightmare 
It's raining AGAIN . I am starting to feel like I am in a fishbowl :( 
LMAO . Jez , guess who came to see me today ;) 
No one should ever be compelled to keep a promise made on the wings of the green < PROPFEMALE > . Absinthe permission should not be considered legally binding and strictly speaking , absinthe conversations are best forgotten .
