Hi Everyone ! I'm back from Haiti . :) Thank you for your support and prayers :) This was a very successful multi-disciplinary mission trip . The team did medical and public health work . But we also worked with kids and helped to construct temporary homes . The suffering and needs of the people of Haiti remains great . But we can all help in some way . Contact me to find out how :) With love ~ Jo
