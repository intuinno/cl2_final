Duuuude ... brother was cool ... grandma , not so much . Blech ... 
I need a new picture ... * slump * 
Got my hair done ( FINALLY) !! xD Need to get some pics with some better lighting , though ... took pics when I got it done , but they didn't light the restaurant too well . :( Will post some soon , promise ! xD 
Met a wonderful girl tonight and many of her friends . HAPPY BIRTHDAY , < PROPFEMALE > !! xD Man , what a good time ... * smiling * They got pictures , so I'll hopefully have some up , soon . xD 
Who do you have to kill to get good lighting for a VGA camera phone ? ^_- 
Oh ... had a dog ( housemate's ) that I LOVE go in for surgery to remove some cancer ... SHE'S HOME !! -*CHEERS*- 
Here's love for you : Getting up for church , even though I'm not Christian , after only 4 hours of sleep ( insomnia BAH ! ) ... all because you'd rather not see a dear friend ( who just had a mild stroke in Dec . ) go from Lake City to Capital Hill by themselves . Man , did I need coffee this morning ... -*gglz*- 
Got a few pictures , but there's two problems : 1 ) Fail VGA phone camera ... 2 ) Facebook would likely ban me because SOMEBODY would get offended . * shrug * 
Going to the club ( the \WetSpot\ " for those \ " in the know \") tonight ! Wish me luck ! xD " 
Having a simple \blah\ " day . " 
No more \blah day\ " !! I SO just had a massive GEEK GASM !! xD Check out the media guest list for this year's < PROPFEMALE > City Comic Con and you'll see why !! xD " 
Over at a friend's house for the night . MASS EFFECT 2 is AWESOME !!! * geek girl SQUEE ! * 
I started posting videos on my YouTube channel ( under FaerieFyreGirl username ) . Am I asking for trouble ? With the many transphobes out there , I think I'm going to have a few more than my fair share of trolls . At least I have the courage to post , though . -shrug- 
Gods ... I need to stop staying up so late ... or is it early ? O.o 
To all on my friends list : I'm almost never online ... sorry about that . 
I need some new , higher quality pics . Agree ? Click \Like \"." 
Broadcasting on BlogTV.com tonight at 4pm PDT : http://www.blogtv.com/people/faeriefyre 
OMG ! < PROPFEMALE > hit a WHOPPER ! Joss Whedon is rumored to be the director for the Avengers movie !! Sadly , I'm about a month behind on this news ... >.> 
Heading to bed soon with so many ideas floating around in my head . Maybe I'll dream something to contribute . For those who don't know , I've started writing , again . It's been a long time coming , too . Let the dethroning of sparkly vampires COMMENSE ! xD 
Off to a < PROPMALE > start , but I think the book is coming along fine . Chapter One still not finished , but I'm getting there . ;) 
For the first time ever , I'm going to marching in the Pride parade , today . I admit some reluctance at this , but it should be okay . I'm not really one who's a fan of the spotlight , but more visible trans girls is a good thing for the community . Besides , it's a nice day . 
Chapter One is FINALLY finished ! It's about 12 pages , single spaced , according to MS Works Word Processor . Took me long enough . * gglz * xD 
Been a little busy the last few days , but the book is coming along well and I think I'm making a new group of friends . xD 
Why do I even BOTHER making plans ? Two months ago , I planned to attend my 10-year reunion with a friend of mine . SSI and DSHS have been giving me the shaft for over a year , so I'm so broke I can't pay attention ... let alone fork over $300 for a round trip Greyhound ticket ... let alone $20 for the reunion party . 
Life has a tendency of surprising me , it seems . So , I WILL be in Burley this weekend and for the reunion ! OMG , that happened fast ... >.> 
FINALLY home once again after making the trek to Idaho for the reunion . It's a long story , really . I'll post a video on my YouTube channel and link everybody here . There's quite the tale to weave . Until then , I'm recovering and relaxing before I rev up in a day or two for something else entirely . ( and , of course , catching up on a week's worth of FB and email stuff ) 
Well , it's about time to get back into the fight with SSI and DSHS . I finally got a lawyer . Now ... I need to find my armor and not stay awake all night and sleep all day . >.> ( friggin ' insomnia on top of depression ... >.<) 
Apparently , a lot of people are meeting others and hooking up here on Facebook . I can think of several examples , including that Turkish guy who made a music video based on the subject . So , am I not online enough ? O.o 
Connecting with old friends is really therapeutic . In the past two weeks , I've run into at least two friends I haven't heard hide or hair of since < PROPMALE > high . It's good to get in touch with you guys again ( you know who you are ! ) . And , thanks for the long-lasting phone call . It did me good today . :) 
Got a < PROPMALE > to stand on the Soapbox last night at the meeting of the LGBT Commission . For those of you Seattle people who don't know about the commission , I'll share some links . Hopefully , with many voices being heard , some of the not-so-kosher practices of the Seattle Police Department will be changed for the better ( including a \No Tolerance\ " policy in regards to racist/sexist/etc . practices ) . " 
With recent political news/insight , maybe I should just keep my nose out of it ? * shakes head * Nah ... 
Getting ready to head over to Ingersoll tonight . Hope to see some peeps there . xD 
Liberals of America : Why aren't WE pissed off ?! 
Surrounded by people and in a populous area , I feel so trapped and alone ... 
* sigh * Today's the day the application gets done and over with . The ball will be rolling , again ... wish me luck . 
I like it on the dresser or the kitchen counter . Good , convenient places . :)

* sings poorly * On the road again ... * long sigh * Gods , why does life have to keep throwing me the same bloody lemons ? * another sigh * Well , there will probably be another lapse in my communication level pretty soon . I apologize to everyone , in advance . * sad panda * 
Happy to be back in The Wasteland . Mojave is nice . Capital Wasteland is for NOOBS ! xD 
Much of last week , I spent a great deal of time gallivanting about the Mojave Wasteland . This week , Albion will be mine !!! xD 
Getting really psyched about the \Rally To Restore Sanity\ " downtown tomorrow . Who's with me ??!! xD " 
Happy Samhain to all my friends ! Blessed be . :) 
Oh , dear lord ... Republicans now have control of the House of Representatives . This is going to be a catastrophe ! You think Washington wasn't productive BEFORE , just wait through the next couple years . I didn't buy tickets to this circus ! Did anyone else ? 
FINALLY !!!! Honestly , I really could have fainted when I went grocery shopping yesterday morning . Went to get a few things and , true to character , checked my receipt to determine my food stamp balance . Imagine my surprise when I found a handful of Benjamins were my new friends ! I could have fainted ! \ 
\ 
What does this mean ? Well , after 1 and 1/2 years of trying , I FINALLY have my medical coverage back ! 
Another solemn weekend beginning . National Transgender Day of Rememberance is never a happy time . It's a time to remember the voices that were silenced . Thankfully , the < PROPFIRST > were down , this year , but just one is bad enough . This year , I didn't go to any events , but held a quiet vigil at home . 
HOLY JEEBUS , IT'S COLD OUTSIDE !!! >.< 
I'm thinking about you , Daddy . Just haven't been ab < PROPFEMALE > to call , yet ... besides , it's 2 am and you'd kill me . * < PROPFEMALE > sigh * 
I'm thankful for my family , friends , and random words of encouragement from nearly perfect strangers . These are the lights of my life . \ 
That , and my Xbox 360 ... if I actually owned one ... ( hint-hint , nudge-nudge , shove down the stairs ) 
14 days and counting ... * sigh * 
13 days , and counting ... 
12 days and counting ... Also , I need a girlfriend . Applicants ? 
Well , the countdown is over ... though , haven't been able to update because < PROPFEMALE>'s laptop kicked the bucket . So , my activity just went down the toilet . Man , I need my own computer ... >.< For those with an Xbox , catch me on Xbox LIVE . :) 
I'm back ? I think ? Well , the laptop has been repaired and roared to life earlier today ... after a quick insertion of the Windows disc for repairs to the OS . Man , I do not envy < PROPFEMALE > , but her efforts have paid off and her baby lives again . Everyone send her good tidings . She really worked pretty hard on that . 
I'm going to try something . I have no idea if it'll work or where it will go , but I've felt this overwhelming need to do something like this for a while , now . So , from time to time , check my notes for updates . I'm going to start writing game reviews . Hope you enjoy them . 
Okay , so got my hair done for late birthday/early Christmas present . Now , need to find a camera to document the occasion ... >.> 
At this point in time , I am actually seriously considering running for the House of Representatives . I will be researching campaign rules and the like for the time being to see where I'd fall in the divide . Currently , I would consider either District 1 ( who will be loosing a Rep. in 2012 ) or District 2 . I live in District 2 , but WA just got another House seat , so that could be changing soon . Thoughts ? Comments ? 
Well , it's that time , again . Time to rush head-long into 2011 . Not like we have much of a choice , right ? Happy New Year , everybody ! xD 
I have an admission to make : I have a very hard time being happy for the people posting up news that they got their surgery or the date for said surgery is now set in stone . I love you guys , really , but the fact that I cannot afford it and probably never will tears me apart . I hope you can forgive me , but I just can't bring myself to be happy about it . 
I just got an e-mail from the HRC , < PROPFIRST > Solmonese , urging me to donate to the fight against hate groups standing in the way of MARRIAGE EQUALITY ? Okay , < PROPFIRST > , it's a relatively important topic of discussion . However , marriage doesn't mean < PROPFIRST > if you can't get a job ! Why aren't we fighting for < PROPFEMALE > anymore ? Why isn't THAT our #1 issue ?! 
< PROPFEMALE > and Gin . 
I want to add a \Games\ " Section to my profile since they took away my Xbox 360 tab !! >.<" 
The people of the United States could learn something from the NFL : if a random small town nobody can beat all the odds , win the first two Super Bowls , and continue to compete with the richest guy from the big city , so can anyone .
