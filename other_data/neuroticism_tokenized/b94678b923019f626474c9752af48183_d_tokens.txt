Say what you mean , and mean what you say . 
My Antonio .. newest guilty pleasure , hahaha 
Every now and then you need to let yourself break down just a bit so you can rearrange all the pieces in a new way . 
thnx Jewels , for the disgusting flu . I will make sure to return the favor at some point ... ughhhhh 
Damn .. it's like that . ok . 
To do our best ' means that at all times in our everyday life we should probe our minds so that we don't feel guilty about our mistakes , even though others don't know about them . If we do that , we are truly doing our best . 
Ready ... Set ... GO .. GAME ON ! lmao 
When you ride in a boat and watch the shore , you might assume that the shore is moving . But when you keep your eyes closely on the boat , you can see that the boat moves . Similarly , if you examine myriad things with a confused body and mind you might suppose that your mind and nature are permanent . When you practice intimately and return to where you are , it will be clear that nothing at all has unchanging self . 
watching < PROPFEMALE > Wars Episode III : Revenge Of The Sith , it NEVER gets old ! If you disagree I will use my Jedi mind tricks on u ! lol 
Do not speak- unless it improves on silence . 
The beauty of life is , while we cannot undo what is done , we can see it , understand it , learn from it and change . So that every new moment is spent not in regret , guilt , fear or anger , but in wisdom , understanding and love . 
How many times does one have to prove themselves until they give up ? Hmmm ... 
Do not go gentle into that good night , Old age should burn and rave at close of day ; Rage , rage against the dying of the light . 
Whether you think you can or can't; You're right either way . 
OMG ! Can't wait for Friday !!! Jewels it's gonna be pretty sweet lol =]

People need to understand that children with special needs don't have an illness , so there is no cure & it's not contagious . They only want what we all want , to be accepted . Most of you probably won't copy and paste this . Will you do it and leave it on your status for at least an hour ? It's Special Education week , and this is in honor of all the kids who need a little extra help & understanding . 
:) :)

Whatever you give a woman , she will make it greater . Give her sperm , she will give you a baby . Give her a house , she will give you a home . Give her groceries , she will give you a meal . Give her a smile and she will give you her heart . She multiplies and enlarges what she is given . So if u give her crap , be ready to receive a ton of shit . Real women keep this going !

The will of God will never take you where the Grace of God will not protect you 
DEPRESSION is not a sign of weakness it is a sign that you have been trying to be strong for too long . Put this as your status if you know someone who has or has had depression . Will you do it and leave it on your status for at least an hour ? Most people won't , but it's mental health week and 1 in 3 of us will suffer at some point in our lives . Show your support good people . I copy and pasted , will you

a little historia , Cinco de Mayo is a Mexican holiday which celebrates the victory over French forces on May 5 , 1862 at the Battle of Puebla . It is often mistakenly thought to be Mexicos Independence Day , which is actually September 16 . More of an emotional victory than a military one , to Mexicans the Battle of Puebla represents Mexican resolve and bravery in the face of an overwhelming foe . < PROPFEMALE > la Raza !

While you SCREAM at your woman , there's a man wishing he could whisper softly in her ear . While you HUMILIATE , OFFEND & INSULT her , there's a man flirting with her & reminding her how wonderful she is . While you HURT your woman , there's a man wishing he could make love to her . While you make your woman CRY there's a man stealing smiles from her !! Post this on your wall if you're against Domestic Violence

We must learn how to identify the opposing sides in our inner conflicts . Take anger : we need to see how destructive it is and at the same time , realize there are antidotes within our own thoughts and emotions that can counter it . So by understanding how negative it is and then by strengthening our positive thoughts and emotions , we can gradually reduce the force of our anger and hatred
