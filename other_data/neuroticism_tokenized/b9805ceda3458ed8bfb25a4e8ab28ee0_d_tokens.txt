It is military tradition that true friends can go long periods of time \ 
without speaking and never question their friendship . These friends pick\ 
up just like they spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been \ 
or how far apart they live . REPOST this if you are lucky enough to have \ 
...... at least one friend like this .
