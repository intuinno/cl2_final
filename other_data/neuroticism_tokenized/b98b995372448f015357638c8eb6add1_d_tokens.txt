DAY OFF 
OFF MEDS FOREVER 
been paying attention to lyrics a lot lately , trying to find a single song that summarizes how I feel . but the lyrics are affecting how I feel as I hear them . so it's an ongoing search for how I originally felt , with an open mind to new feelings elicited by the lyrics . 
Man that was one juicy freakin nectarine . I'm talkin really ... really ... juicy . Easily the juiciest one I ever had ! ( and that's not a metaphor you sick people ) 
back to work then GAME 6 
is already pumped for game 7 ... 
had a good day ... went to the movies with my Pops ( The A-Team was sick by the way ) , mowed his lawn , and worked the night shift at Countryside :) 
Read my bio please ... just wrote it ! 
poor birds and fish and wildlife , drenched in oil . with millions of gallons still pouring into the ocean every day ... completely unthinkable :(

Happy summer , officially :-) 
It ain't awful hard to tell\ 
What it's like , my little hell\ 
Yeah she knows , she knows , she knows 
Census income goal - check . Weeks left - 8 . Amount I'm gonna exceed the original goal - a shit load . 
36 hours of work + a lawn in 3 days ... now that's wtf I'm talkin about . getting some sleep before day 3 . life sucks when you're tired but it all gets better the following Friday if you catch my drift . 
turning my alarm OFF and going to sleep now ... till who knows when :) 
\words can't say and I can't do enough to prove ... it's all for you \"" 
Yay interest on all 3 stafford loans - paid ! As for the principal balances ... uhh ... 
it's very possible that the Census extension to August 20 was BS , and that today was the very last day . but you know what ? that's okay :) 
Follow me and everything is alright\ 
I'll be the one to tuck you in at night\ 
And if you want to leave , I can guarantee\ 
You won't find nobody else like me

Apparently emotion is not something to express on Facebook . And being open about stigmatized facets of yourself is not something you want to do in general . I'm just surprised that my family are the only ones who have said anything . I say never worry about anyone judging you for anything , period :)

No longer up to me , a compass leads the way\ 
Restless evening spirit unwilling to cease\ 
Responsible for what the Ouija board might say\ 
Although it's my finger that moves the piece 
shivers . 
No matter what I’m feeling like , it all flows right through me when I run . I could feel sad , but running picks me up . I could feel stressed , but running calms me down . I could feel like a hopeless romantic or a total failure ... but none of it matters knowing that I’m running 8 < PROPMALE > an hour with nothing holding me back . I’m never gonna stop running . I hope I die at 100 years old mid run screaming how amazing life is .
