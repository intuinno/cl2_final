You make me smile like the sun/ Fall out of bed , sing like bird/ Dizzy in my head , spin like a record/ Crazy on a Sunday night/ You make me dance like a fool/ Forget how to breathe/ Shine like gold , buzz like a < PROPFEMALE > / Just the thought of you can drive me wild/ Ohh , you make me smile 

You make breaking hearts look so easy/ Seems like you've done this before/ You've got breaking hearts all but down/ and you've done this , you've done this before/ You make stealing hearts look so easy/ Where is the [ guy ] I adore ? / You've got breaking up all but down ; and I can't love a thief anymore . </3 
is in Texas . 
I think its pretty obvious that I never get on here ... but in case anyone somehow didn't notice .. I don't hate you and I am not ignoring you , I just never get on facebook . 
hmm so I am actually on faceboook updating and doing things for once ... interesting .. 
I am Vindicated I am selfish , I am wrong I am right , I swear I'm right Swear I knew it all along And I am Flawed But I am cleaning up so well I am seeing in me now The things you swore you saw yourself 
when your life's a mess , when your feeling blue or are in distress I know what can wipe that sad away . All you have to do is put a banana in your ear ! ( a banana in my ear ? )Put a ripe banana right into your favorite ear . It's true ( says who ? )So true . Once it's in your ear gloom will disappear . The bad in the world is hard to hear when in your ear a banana cheers ! So go and put a banana in your ear ! 
I just went to see New < PROPFEMALE > , and I'd just like to say that while the entire movie was awkward and emo , and < PROPFIRST > is just strange looking and I never want to see him shirtless again , < PROPMALE > Black and his 108 degrees can keep me warm anyyyytime . 
it is unfortunate I discovered the quiz section of Facebook . I have a bit of an addiction to online quizzes . 
Society , you're a crazy breed/ Hope you're not lonely without me ... / When you want more than you have/ You think you need ... / And when you think more than you want/ Your thoughts begin to bleed/ I think I need to find a bigger place/ Because when you have more than you think/ You need more space 
I think you should all buy spaghetti supper tickets from me :D 
Oh , no , I do not hook up , up ! I go slow . So if you want me , I don't come cheap . Keep your hand in my hand , and your heart on your sleeve . 
hahahahaha I just realized it said I'm a lesbian on here . howwwww the heck that happened Idk . but I changed it . Haaa . I am so amused . 
what is with people who get off or stop talking to you without saying bye ? =/ That is like my BIGGEST pet peeve and people do it all the time . 
I CAN has phone XD 
is not a cat .... just meows when tickled . 
It's the day after Christmas ! For the Heurich's , anyway .... (: 
The first rule of Fight Club is don't talk about Fight Club . The secound rule of fight club is ... don't talk about Fight Club ! =D 
I'm thinking about reading some of my poems at Blackbird's next open < PROPFIRST > night . But I am slightly terrified . If people were mean I might cry . Especially if they threw tomatoes . Tomatoes would definitely make me cry . Especially if I was wearing a cute shirt . Anyway , this is obviously a dangerous idea . What do you guys tihnk , should I do it ? >.> 
I think I'll try , Defying gravity , Kiss me goodbye I am defying gravity , And you wont bring me down ! I think Glee and Wicked is a beautiful combination :) 
You say you make them good girls go bad , but sweetie I make them bad boys good ;) 
Open < PROPFIRST > night was fun . I almost threw up on my shoes . Apparently its alot easier to act out someone elses lines than read your own words . ( to me at least ) Hopefully people could understand my poem through the hyperventilation and didn't think it was * too * bad lol . I didn't get to read my secound one ... I might try next time . :) And do like , pregnant lady breath excersizes first . haa . 
< PROPFEMALE > , everyone I told I would be at Blackbird Friday , sorry , I have to cancel . I forgot my friend's birthday party is then . See you guys some other time :) 
Who thinks a checkers tournament sounds interesting ? A couple people already told me it sounded like the lamest thing ever ... but does everyone agree ? I'm thinking about having one , not sure where yet , maybe my house . Everybody who enters would put in a dollar and the winner would get all the money in the end . Anyway , if anyone thinks it sounds interesting or has any suggestions tell me . 
Tonight was awesome :) I had fun with everyone at < PROPFIRST>'s birthday party , and then I came home and watched a two hour special of Smallville ! woot woot ! Not only that , but it was one of the best episodes ever . :D And I ate popcorn shrimp ! This makes for a happy < PROPFEMALE > . ^_^ I am soooo tired tho now . It is definitly sleepytime . 
Kudos to < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . I got pranked sooooo bad . I'm not sure if I'm insanely gullible , or he's an evilmastermind , or both . Either way , I'm still laughing ! Love ya man . 
let's take these lines and draw ourselves out of here . This shipwreck , from set-sail , we'll map the stars <3 
I suddenly feel like the book I'm writing is complete crap and have the urge to trash everything I've done with it so far . I am refraining from indulging this urge this in case this feeling passes and I have gotten rid of years of work for no reason . I am very frustrated tho . :( 
The Cranberries will never get old (: 
what delightful futter-wacking . 
Sometimes studying American History , particularly about Native AMericans , makes me physically ill :( 
I am writing this from my NEW LAPTOP . Well its not really new , but its new to me . It was my dads but it was really slow so no one used it , and then my genius brother fixed it up and now its mine :D 
\His ideologies are revolving doors around his ego . \"- John Heurich " 
UPDATE : I'm probably not moving until the end of summer now . Sorry to those of you who can't wait to be rid of me ;) 
Play some ( good ) electronic music and I can't help but dance . 
\this song gets in your brain then you become addicted and then you spend all your money ? on this cd finally you wake up in an alley listening to this song homeless and happy \"- Some random person on Youtube . :D " 
thinks < PROPFEMALE > should have got a supersize electric pencil sharpener . It would have saved her a lot of work whittling stakes . Stake sharpeners should be found at your local magic shop , imo . It seems like they would be essential . 
( re)Enter the Mighty Morphin ' Power Daleks ! I just had to say that . Even though probubly no one will have a clue what I'm talking about . lol . 
Don't sing \Pants on the Ground\ " in public . You might get arrested . Seriously >.>" 
should probubly turn on the ringer on her cell phone when she finds it so that the next time she loses it she can just call it . >.> 
I have this problem where when I'm writing somethign , just when I get to the point where I intended to wrap it up , some new , cool , plot turn occurs to me . So I write that in , and then just when I get ready to finish , I get another great idea . So I write that in ... and then just when , well you get the picture . My own ingenuity works against me >.< It truly is the never-ending story O.o 
I love singing Glee songs :) I'm a total Gleek and proud of it . <3 
Screw Facebook and it's too small status limits . 
Pray for my daddy . He was taking < PROPMALE > for a walk and two big dogs tried to eat < PROPMALE > up , so he tried to defend < PROPMALE > and he fell on the concrete and got all smashed . :( He's in the emergency room all purply and swollen now . 
I don't wanna bend like the bad girls bend ; I just wanna be your friend . Is it ever gonna be enough ? Is it ever gonna be enough ? Is it ever gonna be enough ? 
You treat me just like , another stranger . Well it's nice to meet you , sir . I guess I'll go . I best be on my way out . 
To anybody who has texted me the last few days : I'm not ignoring you . My evil phone is hiding from me AGAIN . I'm even more impatient and annoyed than you are , trust me . I've been looking for it for three days . Whenever I find it ... I'll get back to you . 
After helping out at the soup kitchen with my good friends < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > Toliver , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > , and < PROPFEMALE > Shoup , I spent the rest of my funtastic day with < PROPFEMALE > Smalley and < PROPFIRST > Pederson ! They are pretty dang ace . And we bought amazing fizzy juice at Huddle House . Woot ! :D 
We're so close to something better left unknown , I can feel it my bones 
If you \like\ " my status I will tell you one thing I like about you . Make this your status if you want a challenge :) " 
baking is the tastiest science ! :D 
fought the war but the war won . 
Cooler , relieving , I taste it , it's so good . It's the mind blowingist big thing , Never lose it if I could . Give me something real , give me something real , ' Cause nothing breaks me like the truth <3 
If we get out of the car THEY WILL EAT US LIKE BLOODY CHICKENS ! Yes , someone said this to me today . 
My dad just found my phone !!!!! XD 
Loves the Wii and oldskool nintendo ... but wants to play Portal :( I have a plan to buy it , find someone with a ps3 , and sneak into their house and play it when they are gone . This is the most obvious solution . It might take several visits though . 
Confessions of a Shopaholic is a horribly nerve wracking movie ! I literally ran out of the room screaming a couple times because I just couldn't watch . < PROPFIRST > laughed at me lol . 
Feels kindof terrrible . :/ I'ma go buy lots of juice and cough drops . The yummy cough drops ... not the awful tasting kind . 
wants to find a psychologically captivating film like < PROPFIRST > Darko or Fight Club that will blow her brains away and preferably rip her heart out as well . 
The doctor asked me if I've had a fever while I was sick , and I said \Well I haven't taken my temperature but people were saying I was hot the other day . \ " And then my dad told me Facebook picture comments are not medical diagnosis . lol . " 
So the doctor gave me some HORRIBLE medication for my sinus infection that made me start freaking out and I had a panic attack in the middle of church .... I am never taking that stuff again ! It scares me . 
thinks her life is finally going the way she wants it , and is very happy about it :) 
being a nanny is really just an excuse to swing , jump on the trampoline , watch cartoons , color , and play < PROPFIRST > all day . lol . 
thinks her Fourth of July party turned out to be pretty awesome :) Except for the fact she lost her phone , AGAIN . >.< 
Blackbird Friday ? Whos with me ? :D 
When you lay with babies , you're gonna get pee on your bed . XP 
is going to Blackbird tonight , and bringing poems . Check your tomatoes at the door , please :D 
the pretzels are right here whenever you decide you want them :) 
Now I may not be the worst or the best . But you gotta respect my honesty . And I may break your heart , but I don't really think there's anybody as bomb as me .... If you fall for me , I'm not easy to please . I might tear you apart . Told you from the start , I'm only gonna break break your , break break your heart . 
ugh I am so tired and irritable today XP 
< PROPMALE > is dancing and singing the chorus to Break Your Heart word for word . LOL ! I think we have a young player rising ;) 
Everybody , everybody just wanna fall in love . Everybody , everybody just want to play the lead ... 
I don't care what people say , the rush is worth the price I pay . I get so high when you're with me , then crash and crave you when you leave <3 
thinks it's funny people always assume her and her bestest < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Smalley are a couple . :) 
I have 21 nonfamily guys < PROPFIRST > in my phone and only 10 nonfamily girls < PROPFIRST > . Interesting . 
Day and night , I toss and turn , I keep stressing my mind , mind . I look for peace but see I don't attain , what I need for keeps this silly game we play , play ... 
Facebook should be renamed FAILbook . Everytime I go to IM someone it says they are offline and then 3 seconds later says they are online so I go to IM them again and then it says they are offline ! Arrrrrg . ( I feel piratey after typing that . ) I guess I will just have to text ppl . 
thinks there is a difference between being nice and telling someone what they want to hear . 
Golly gee , I sure do love them screamo covers of rap songs . :D 
Stop being such a Cheeto , that line is dangerously cheesy . :P 
Day and night , I toss and turn , just keep stressin my mind mind ... 
heeey , let's all get together and do some Spanish . No , really , I only have five more days to finish >.> 
feels like a little kid who just built a magnificent tower of blocks and then watched someone kick it down and stomp on it . :( 
Have you ever purposefully repeated back someone's previously stated opinion to them as if it were your own , and had them argue against it ? It's a rather amusing practice . 
sounds like a frog . Nobody kiss me because I have NO interest in becoming a < PROPMALE > . 
You think I'm pretty , without any makeup on . You think I'm funny , when I tell the punchline wrong . I know you get me , so I let my walls come down . Before you met me , I was alright , but things were kinda heavy , you brought me to life <3 
Till now , I always got by on my own ... I never really cared until I met you . And now , it chills me to the bone ... how do I get you alone ? <3 
* We * we are the insane geniuses , the judged and misunderstood , put through hell , but we grin , we're broken and it shows , but everybody's broken , just not everybody knows - < PROPFEMALE > Heurich , August 24 , 2010 
You win some you lose some . That's life ... I guess . :/ 
Tell . me . how . I'm . supposed . to . breath . with . no . air <3 
“Two things are infinite : the universe and human stupidity ; and I'm not sure about the former . \-that Einstein dude was a smarty pants :) " 
Listening to all the Nightmare Before Christmas songs again , originals and covers ^_^ 
I hate it when I get all crazy anxious at night and want to talk to someone and no one is awake :/ 
I speak in many tongues of many men , Argue with angels and I always win , But I don’t know the first thing about love , the first thing about love ... 
Wooo I am suddenly wide awake . I love helping people . Mayjooor endorphine rush . 
For those of you who don't know , the most hilarious person to ever live , my brilliant brother < PROPFIRST > , passed away yesterday . He is deeply loved , greatly missed , and will never be forgotten . 
I thought I knew what a broken heart felt like . I had no idea . 
I'm making photo alblums for the family , and including quotes from John , as well as from his favourite books , movies , and music . If you knew him , I am open to suggestions . 
I'm having a hard time starting conversations with people because I'm afraid they will ask if I am ok . I hate that question . 
It's\ 
the kind of broken heart you never really get over , we can't move \ 
on ... we'll never have another brother , it's gonna be chaotic , a sea of \ 
< PROPFEMALE > weather , it comes in waves you see ... but we can make it together , \ 
just hold on to me , we'll cry our tears , and let our hearts bleed , and \ 
it wont hurt as much , eventually ... I miss you < PROPFIRST > Heurich , and I love you < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Heurich . 
Oh hold me ... now I feel contagious ! Am I the only place you've left to go ? <3 
My my , hey hey ... it's better to burn out than fade away . 
strongly believes that absence makes the heart grow fonder- so see ya later trick ! 
is a flight risk with a fear of falling ... 
There goes my hero , he's ordinary <3 
is horribly ill :( I am trying to ignore it tho . 
So tell me baby , pretty baby , that this house is not a graveyard , tell me how to stay strong , and < PROPFEMALE > you home , over corpses of our long lost fathers and our unborn daughters , cuz I can't do it alone <3 
Just kidding , I didn't move to Macon . I mean I am in Dublin about the same amount of time . lol . I am a commuter . 
It's funny how just when I started to think I was safe because got the to the point where I figured out how to stop handing my heart out like < PROPFEMALE > after being tired of getting it broken so many times , the one guy I thought it was safe with broke it-by dieing . 
If you landed on an alien planet where the local intelligent life form tasted unbelievably good , would you eat them ? 
The first Questionable Content comic BOOK has been unleashed onto the world . The first 300 comics all redone and nice-ied up . I want it , I want it , I WANT IT ! 
Many waters cannot quench love ; rivers cannot wash it away . If one were to give all the wealth of his house for love , it would be utterly scorned . - < PROPMALE > 8:7 
This love has got no ceiling <3 
has a huge jar of cheese dip ... and no chips :( 
There is no dark side of the < PROPFEMALE > , matter of fact , its all dark 
Becca on our halloween costumes \Alone

Thanks to everyone who wished me a happy birthday ! =) < mass hug > 
Whooo wants to go see Due Date wif me today ? =D 
Who cares if you disagree ? You are not me . Who made you < PROPMALE > of anything ? You dare tell me who to be ? Who died and made you < PROPMALE > of anything ? 
wants a chillie cheese dog . Wishes for a chillie cheese dog . * squints eyes and scrunches up nose ... waits , waits .. * clearly has not mastered that superpower yet :( 
likes having headphones so she can listen to the same song 2,372 times and not get on other people's nerves . 
watched < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim VS The World and it was amaaaazing XD 
sometimes it seems like I'm the only person in this world not playing games . Why can't people just say what they mean ? 
feels like she's in The Twilight Zone . 
I have a heart , I swear I do , but just not , baby , when it comes to you ;)

just about finished the worst day of my life . 
I don't have my phone right now ... incase anybody is trying to get ahold of me . 
ain't no sunshine when she's gone . It's not warm when she's away . Ain't no sunshine when she's gone and she's always gone too long , any time she goes away <3

I promise you kid , I'll give so much more than I get . I just haven't met you yet ...

Sometimes people suck . And sometimes they don't . You just have to find the people who suck less often , and stick by them . 
misses all her friends and is about to walk herself to Dublin . =/ 
Well today I don't feel good , I miss my brother , I miss my Dublin friends , I'm trying to figure out all sorts of complicated things , like what the heck I want , and what the heck I'm doing with my life .... I'm just not having a very good day . I think I will just sleep . Sleep is good . 
Ever notice the person you want to call or text you is always the one person who doesn't ? You've got a full inbox but that just makes it worse . 
I'm going to Dublin tomorrow to stay with my bestest friend < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > for a few days <3 Hopefully I'll see everyone at church Sunday ... I'm also looking forward to hanging out with < PROPFEMALE > Pederson , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > Pederson , and < PROPFEMALE > Pederson at some point while I'm in town :) Love you guuuys . 
some people are just born with tragedy in their blood ... 
I need a new best guy friend . They keep moving or going to college or getting girlfriends who hate me or other such things . And now that I'm in Macon I'm away from all my less than best guyfriends . lol . I'm going to make an application or something . 
I'm so much more confident around my friends . It's easy to be completely yourself when you know people will love you no matter what you say or do . I wish I could take them everywhere with me . New people are scary XP
