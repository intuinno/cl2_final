Going paintballing with both my brothers tomorrow ! It's going to be so fun ! =) 

Happy Birthday to the very best friend and sister I could ever ask for !!! ( OK , it's not your Birthday today , but today is your party ! ) Love ya , B !! Hope today is fun ! ^^ <3 <3 <3 
YAY ! I get to see < PROPMALE > tomorrow !!! <3 -Is sitting on Cloud 10- Yup , Cloud 10 ! That's how happy I am ! ^_ ~ Can't wait ! <3 
Made some AWESOME vegetable lasagna with my sister !!! <3 
Not feeling well because of my stupid ear ... Grr ! And yet , I continue to go to school ... 
Going to my second Charger game EVER !!! It'll be so much fun ! Hanging with Breezy and < PROPFIRST > this weekend ! <3 Sadly , no < PROPMALE > ! =( Oh well ! IT should still be fun ! 
Had a really emotional talk with her mom and it worked out . <3 I think it went really well ! Loves her boyfriend and is very happy with her current relationship ! <3 
Is sick , but trying to feel better . < PROPMALE>'s and my 6 month anniversary is coming up !! <3 Yay , Sunday ! 
WOO ! Two week break ! -cough- My sister is in New York , my boyfriend still has school , I ahve nothing to do except homework , and I can't sleep well . Ah , well , I guess I have to just take life by the horns and do what Dr. < PROPMALE > does and ride my motorcycle by a group of near-protesting teachers . Where can I get myself some of those ? 
ASVAB today , Physical tomorrow .... AT 5AM !!!! USMC , OORAH ! 
Is a DEP Recruit for the United States < PROPFEMALE > Corps . OORAH ! Can't wait for boot ! It sounds like fun ! Except getting up early , working out a lot , hours upon hours in the classroom , going to bed late , and get yelled at all day ... But other than that ? A piece of cake !! 
Got a cool spiritual cleansing thing and I'm very relaxed ! <3 I have PT tomorrow , so I think I need all the relaxation I can get ! 
\Let your morals make you an angel and your wisdom be your wings . \"~ A . C . D . ~ " 
Working out to build up my muscle's endurance . (( < PROPFEMALE > Corps workouts are pretty demanding . )) Any ideas/tips ? 
I'm definitely sick ... =( And I have to PT with the Marines tomorrow ... 
Is at home . SICK . I don't have a voice . Apparently , that converted some people to Christianity . I don't understand , my voice is equivalent to that of a chorus of angels singing of God's grace . ^ ~ <3 Hopefully , I get better soon . I can't even PT today !!! 
Just celebrated the < PROPFEMALE > Corps birthday ! It was really fun . <3 Glad to know that my Uncle , < PROPFEMALE > , and cousins are safe and sound at Fort Hood . <3 <3 My prayers are with those families who lost their loved ones . May they rest in peace . OORAH < PROPFEMALE > CORPS ! 234 Years and still going strong ! 
Is saddened by certain events that have occured with her family in the past week . REALLY STRESSED . I'm so happy I have tomorrow off . 
Is feeling great because , with the Bolts charging to victory , she now gets to charge her dad 5 bucks !! HAHAHAHA ! Go BOLTS ! <3 On another note , I'm tired from PASSING my first IST for the < PROPFEMALE > Corps ! OORAH ! 
Doesn't get to see her boyfriend until Thanksgiving day , but only for a short period of time . Missing him already .... Just gotta roll with the punches , even if there has been a lot of them lately . 
Doing a pointless project for a pointless class . Seriously , you would think that an AP class would have depth and would be challenging . This is the easiest course I have on my agenda ! And I'm a student < PROPFEMALE > ... That's saying something . 
Happy Thanksgiving all ! (( Except for Breezy .. Stupid Breezy sleeping in over there with her blanket and snores .. Are you dreaming of a white Christmas or white meat from the turkey ?... Love ya , B ! )) I'm thankful for all that cheesy stuff ( Friends , Family , Boyfriend , Macaroni ... ) But I'm also thankful for all the things I've learned this year and all the people I've met/unmet .

Flying out to < PROPFEMALE > to see my dad on the 21st . I come back on < PROPFIRST > . 6th . I'll miss IB and having Christmas with < PROPFEMALE>'s family . Most of all , I'll miss my mom , Breezy , and < PROPMALE > ... Ironically enough , those are the people I am thankful for . I'll miss my San < PROPMALE > Christmas !!! So many changes are happening right now , and it seems like the world is spinning so fast ... 
Rain . Ah , such a beautiful sight . The renewal that it will bring . Everyone looks at rain as depression , but I'm always happy on these days . =) I was drenched and freezing , but still happy ! Enjoy the rain and the sunshine after the storm . 
I have a hurt knee ... I've been at home , bedridden(mostly ) , and very very bored . Not to mention the fact that there was NO FOOD at my house , so I starved . =( 
I get my grades tomorrow . Not too thrilled , even though I got good grades , because I didn't make CSF .... GRR 
My boyfriend lost his cell phone on the way up to his house . I now have no contact with his at all ... For three weeks . I'm going to miss him so much ! 
Happy Holidays everyone ! I have safely arrived at my father's and officially connected him to the wonders of wireless internet . Next on my agenda -- Teaching him how to set up his Bose surround sound . =) 
Wishes she was back home , cuddled up next to him , waiting to unwrap her nonexistant presents with her best friend/sister , mom , and boyfriend . No matter how much my father misses me , and how much he says this is my home , it's not . Whereever Breezy and my mom is ... That's where I belong . 
Is incredibly happy ! I tried somehting new . I let go of the past and the future , blocked out the thoughts of not being able to talk to < PROPMALE > , and just enjoyed spending time with my niece . We went shopping , did hair and makeup , and went to a Christmas party with 1/10 of my family ( which was A LOT , btw ) . I had a REALLY fun day , and then I got my Christmas wish . < PROPMALE > called me ! =) 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas , all ! Enjoy the festivities , the mistle toe , the egg nog(YUCK ! ) , and the presents ! Most of all , enjoy being with your loved ones . I miss a few , but I'm greatful that I'm with some here . 
Who hates going on vacation to have loads of fun and getting sick ? This girl . 
Isn't sleeping well . At all . I don't know what to do ...! Sleep just doesn't come until 2 in the morning , sometimes later . =( 
My LCD cracked on my phone . Do NOT text me , it'll be pointless and annoying . Thank you ! =) 
Happy New Year's < PROPFEMALE > !!! Enjoy your holiday and be safe !! ALL MV SENIORS ! 5 months and 4 days until we graduate !!!! =) 
Spending New Year alone ... Without cable ... Barely internet ... 
Missing Breezy Perkins < PROPFEMALE > Dunn < PROPFEMALE > Procopio < PROPFEMALE > Macias Vizcarra and < PROPFIRST > P . Macias ... Missing Imperial Beach , California .... 
Wow , I took a nice warm shower , came out and nearly froze half to death . Seriously , Big Bear , warm up for me , just a little , pretty please ? Although , I am getting used to the weather , for example , 37 deg is warm for me now , haha . 
Really enjoying to listening to \All My Life\ " by KC and Jojo and \ " Rythem of Love\ " by PLain White T's =) " 
Good night people ! I think I've tortured myself long enough . No need to just sit around , bored , when I can sleep lol 
I'll be home ... TOMORROW !! =) It's been fun here , but there's nothing better than your own bed n ' pillow to rest your head . And Mom's cookin'! (( Or < PROPFIRST>'s!!!)) Omg , I can play D&D !! ( I can't believe I'm about to say this ... ) ... I even miss B running over my feet !! And < PROPFIRST > talking !! I miss IB , but I'm coming back , and I can't wait ! <3 <3 <3 
Very confused . It's complicated ... How could something so simple in thought , be so absurd when you actually say it aloud ? My head hurts , both literally and figuratively . I'm going to < PROPFEMALE > whoever said learning new things is the best joy in life . That's false advertisement ! 
\ ' No ' is a dirty word . Never gonna say it first . ' No ' is just a thought that never crosses my mind . \"" 
\This could be suicide ; A kiss with these red knives . Why am I traveling by ? I give back to you . \"" 
\Let's use our imagination to figure out what type of anus he is .... You leave no room for mental creativity !! \ " ~ Breezy . " 
Somewhere in between long talks and making fun of each other , I fell in love with him ... And now we're apart , and sometimes it's too much ... Sometimes I just break down ... But it's right then that he scoops me up and wipes away my tears . 
I bought m boyfriend a really cute present and an awesome present . =) Comment on what they are later just in case SOMEONE ( < PROPMALE >...) reads this and tells him . 
\Wisdom begins in wonder ... \ " Unknown . " 
Playing D&D !!! =) Yes , I'm a nerd , but I don't care . I'm hanging out with all my friends for the first time in a long time .. Well , except B&S . But , hey , I can't have it all ! I forgot to mention it , but I've finally reached a year with < PROPMALE > ! ( March 20th ) <3 
I hit my head . It hurts .... My mom thinks I might have a light concussion . I'm going to the doctor tomorrow , so ... -crosses fingers- Let's hope not . 
I just helped an amazing little girl take her first steps . Even with the prostecis , she did wonderfully . I love you , little J !!! <3 
I GOT AN INTERVIEW !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! =) 
I got a job selling CUTCO ! =) Anybody interested in an appointment ? You dont have to buy if you set up an appt . I get paid just for meeting with you . And if you know anyone who wants to buy/might have an interest in buying PLEASE refer them to me . Message me ! Oh P.S. you must be 25+ and have a job . If not just ask your parents ! You dont have to buy an entire set , one knife is ok . And remember PLEASE REFER ME ! Thanks ! 
by the door 
Got a new poem , if you guys wanna check it out . Tell me whatcha feel ! 
I had an apiphany today . And < PROPMALE > has been telling me this all along . I feel like an idiot yet I know that I just wasn't ready to grasp it . Today is a good day . =) 
I like it all over the house . 
I just got back from my trip to Monterey Bay Aquarium and Big Sur . It was beautiful !! Pictures coming shortly . I think I'm getting better at scenic photography . 
If it is the inevitable because I make it so , why did I decide to make it suck so much ? 
With High School over , my next challenge is taking down boot camp . OORAH ! 
I got a very unexpected award last night . The Gold Award signed by President Obama . Definitely cool . 
GRADNIGHT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm so excited !!! =) I'll take TONS of pictures ... And I get to go with all of my best friends and favorite teachers !!! 
GradNight was AMAZING !!! A little annoying at the end with the random stops ... I felt like cattle . But other than that , FUN !!!! Now I'm tired , restless , and wishing someone was here ... But I'm awake enough for grad rehearsal !! ( Is having a VERY busy week ) ... 
Sitting at grad rehearsal , listening to my iPod , waiting as they fill in 30 people at a time . BORING !! 
Thanks for all the Birthday wishes !! You guys are the best ! =) 
Just chillin ' with < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , and Breezy . Eating Takis ( FREAKING ADDICTING ) and watching Tosh . 0 , and Glee at nine !!! Perfect end to an AWESOME birthday ! Thanks , guys ! You know I love you !!! <3 
Just bought myself a few clothes and , shockingly ( no feinting ) , make-up . It was kinda nice to go shopping for myself . And I got my glasses this morning !!! I CAN SEE AGAIN !!!! =) 
Going camping ! Getting in touch with nature , which , by the way , is in < PROPMALE > trouble . Nature won't enjoy my presence very much . I mean , it's me after all . 
NOT happy ... At all . The only thing I'm looking forward to is hanging out with my friends tonight . But , sadly friends , there are even downsides to that . -sighs- Some people are going to feel my wrath if they don't stop being stupid . 
Today better be a good day . It can start by not being cloudy . 
Had lots of fun last night ... And , at the same time , had some really bad moments . Seriously , my friends are the best !!! =) Hmmm .... Making spaghetti and meatballs tonight ! ^^ 
\Behold the Mighty Ostrich !!! \"" 
Going to a Padres game tonight with my friends ! Woo ! =) GO PADRES !!! 
Yard work yesterday . Yard work today . And MORE yard work EARLY in the morning tomorrow . I'm getting a < PROPMALE > workout . haha 
Tired , but I just realized something . I am not stressed . Which hasn't been the case for months now . Woo !!! 
Had an awesome weekend now I'm off to bake for my sister's birthday . Seriously , I can't believe she's 18 !!! ( Almost ) And I'm also making a seriously AWESOME present for another friend who's birthday I missed . =) 
Omg , my food smells so amazing !! =) I want to eat it ! But I can't ... It's a present ... CURSE MY KIND NATURE ! 
My cupcake cakes turned out great ! My friends love them , and the cupcakes are definitely yummy . I hope Breezy enjoys her birthday present !!!! 
Nervous for my IST tomorrow ... So I can't sleep . But I need to sleep . This is BULL . Ungh , hopefully sleep befalls me soon . 
I have a sore throat ! Ungh , it's cold after cold after cold ... I never get sick during summer . =( 
For the first time , I feel good about PT . All I need in my run and then I'm about as ready as I can be for the Marines . OORAH ! 
Misses her sister !!!! </3 Now I have to go back to being bored , lonely , and ashamed .... Actually , I don't but the point is : I miss you , B ! Can't wait to see you =) 
I was looking through my mom's senior yearbook (' 79 ) and she had a whole bunch of old sports news clippings . Since her school was in the same district as MVH I looked it up . There was a posting about a prediction for a game against SWH . \This might be the only < PROPMALE > for either team to win a game this season . Prediction : MV by 1 . \ " We even sucked back then ! :/ " 
< PROPFEMALE > just got a whole bunch of chicks !!! They're so freaking adorable !! <3 I wish I could keep them , haha . Watching Bleach ... The beginning episodes are so addicting ! =) 
Happy Friday the 13th !!! =) 
All I need is my run , and then I'm ready for boot camp . Yay !!! 
IST tomorrow ! Getting hydrated , haha . 
I created a new bank account at Navy Federal to cash my graduation check from my Grandpa ... I can't touch the money until sometime next week ! SO unfair !!! 
Writing a story with my friends ... It's fun ! Yet odd . 
Subtlety is the < PROPMALE > of saying what you think and getting out of the way before it is understood . 
Why is it that guys always tell girls whats good for them , usually implying that the guy is VERY bad for her , even though it's clear she doesn't care and is going to want to be with him no matter what he says ? 
Lets see if my friends can notice the change in me ... I think it's rather startling , especially to people who've known me for awhile . Although , I rather enjoy the change . =) 
If you're sleeping , are you dreaming ? If you're dreaming , are you dreaming of me ? I can't believe you actually picked me ... 
I just pet < PROPFEMALE>'s foot =) 
Inspiration coming from the oddest paces . Realizations coming at the oddest times . I wish it was this easy all the time =) 
< PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > are SO disgusting .... For some reason , they think that what they are saying is funny . < PROPFIRST > , I think you would enjoy them right now . 
Ungh .... Stress SUUUCKS . Getting through it , though , with the help of awesome friends . =) <3 
Looking for jobs SUCKS . Why does everyone want experience ? 
So very full .... Too much food .... Damn those zombies and their rap music ! 
Painting with < PROPFEMALE > . <3 < PROPFEMALE > de la Muerta/All Saints Day gives us inspiration , haha . Yay for painting skulls and marigolds ! 
>.> Can't a girl catch a break ?? 
Ooo eee ooo ahah ting tang walla walla bing bang !! :) 
You live for the fight when thats all that you've got . 
needs a break ... can't wait to just get away from it all .

Happy Thanksgiving , everyone ! :) 
I would just like everyone to know that < PROPFIRST > sucks ... He's sitting right next to me and he's the most horrible man in existence . He should look into improving his visage , it might help with his self esteem issues . =) Love you KunKun ! You're my favorite person to rag on ! =D It's so easy !!! 
So ........ Moving is much more complicated than I expected . Stressed ! 
Moving on Sunday rather than in January . Excited but also nervous ~ ! Back to the boring ( and never fruitful ) job search ! 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone !! My laptop is seeing it's last days it seems ... Apparently it's giving me the present of new beginnings =/ 
Getting ready to leave IB . Just getting dressed and packing last minute things ... I'm going to miss home ! You've been amazing IB ! I already miss my friends and sisters . So much history ... Well its time to make some more . 
All moved in ... Unpacking currently . My hands and feet are COLD !!! \ 
\ 
Who wants to come visit ? =) (( Unfortunately my place is WAY too small ... Maybe one person lol . )) 
it is SNOWING !!!!! :-) 
Happy New Year's < PROPFEMALE > everyone !! Good bye 2010 and hello 2011 !! =) Can't wait to see what the new year holds , I know I surely enjoyed the memories of 2010 . All the big milestones , all the people ( Especially my sisters and mom who helped me get through it all !!! < PROPFEMALE > , you too ! <3<3<3 ) , and especially all the random adventures that led to me being truly confused about life . 
At home , chillin ' .... God the snow is soooo pretty . I recommend not walking in it , however . Loves Big Bear <3 
Grrrrrrrrrrr ..... I hate this internet connection !! It . Sucks . It only shows half of the screen , or randomly disconnects , reconnects and then says it's \unidentifiable\ " and won't give me interwebs !! " 
ok ... I just saw an ad for a movie called cheerleader ninjas . Interesting ..... 
KFC has butter packets now . Not only do they have butter packets , but in < PROPMALE>'s and my to go bag , they put 10 packets . Of butter . I don't even get that many packets of ketchup from BK ! What the heck ? Are we , as Americans , just that obese that they assume to skinny people like < PROPMALE > and I need 10 packets of butter for 1 biscuit each ? REALLY ?! 
Is studying Japanese ... Spanish , for some reason , got boring for me . Hopefully , with < PROPMALE>'s help , I can actually learn it . Can't wait to go back home and actually go to school and learn it , though . 
Feel good songs are my best friend right now ... Why is everything going wrong ? 
OK I'm only doing this out of sheer bordom and because this could be fun . \ 
Send a number to my inbox and I'll tell you what I like and dislike about you , how we met ( if I remember ) , and why I'm glad we're friends . 
#21 - I love that I can tell you anything and you won't judge me . I love that we have been sisters since the day we met and that no matter where we are , we're still close . I LIKE that you get me to the front of the line at Disneyland , haha . I dislike that you thought I was fat when you first saw me !! =( We met on a chilly September morning in 6th grade ! And I'm glad we're SISTERS because I can't live without you . 
Is in love with Rhapsody !!! <3 
Wants her ID already .. And her camera . I can't believe I forgot my camera at home ! How am I supposed to show you guys the BEAUTIFUL place I live in ?! 
Isn't writer's block a bitch ? 
Made potato and hot dog tacos . Surprisingly , < PROPMALE > ate them . Wish < PROPFIRST > P . Macias or < PROPFIRST > Palmatier were here ... They would've loved it =) 
I used to think of love as a < PROPMALE > weakness . Yes , me , hopeless romantic who tells everyone that they need love in there lives . For once , I'm not looking at it as a weakness , but as a strength . If love makes you this way then how is it a weakness ? I would do ANYTHING to protect the people I love . Which gives me the strength to do so . 
Josh : \Your ' u ' looks like an ' e ' on drugs !!! \ " \ 
Alone . In Big Bear ... Sheesh , if I knew I was always going to be alone , I would've brought my imaginary friend !! ;) 
Watching anime , then studying Japanese . After that , choosing the courses I'm enrolling in . I have over three years work at Southwestern . Why must my < PROPMALE > require 38.5 credits ? And in order to transfer , I need 53 more . =( 
I'm starting to be able to read Hirigana !!! YAY !!! =) 
Well ... I am finally going to attempt sleep , although it will not come easily . I hate my nocturnal schedule . I used to be the early bird !! =/ 
Misses her home . Misses her family ( blood and extended ) . Misses her city . But , most of all , I miss the ability to eat ice cream !! 
Watched Inception . Loved it . Usually , I stop watching movies and start looking around ... I couldn't do that here . Had me gripped to the very end . You were right < PROPFIRST > Federowski !! Amazing movie ! =) 
Ahhh ... Best massage ever . And the only cost was making him a sammich ;) 
Josh : \Is a ' burrito ' a mini ' burro' ? \ " \ 
Ungh ... Two bad movies in a row ... Anybody see any good movies lately that they would suggest ? 
Josh : -after eating 1 sandwich , 4 hot dogs , 1.5 packages of ramen , 4 < PROPMALE > crackers , and 1 small bag of chips- \I want spaghetti o's!!!\ " \ 
Night , amazing misfit nerds ! And all you other people ! Time to read and watch anime with mi novio ! =D 
BORED . Watching Bleach but it's taking forever to load the next episode ... =( 
Bored ... Anyone care to talk ? 
I used to love all the Bleach theme songs ... Now I hate the first two openings and endings . Stupid player not letting me skip ahead right away . 
My computer told me the internet was broken . Well , I fixed the internet , does that make me a hero ? =) 
Holy %$^@* !!!! It's 61 degrees here !!! I didn't think if I came to big bear , I'd bring San < PROPMALE > weather in my suitcase ... o.o ;; 
I am a very sad individual . I just got super excited and literally -squealed- while watching the next POTC trailer ... For the second time . Man , I'm lame ... 
Studying Japanese is HARD ... >.< Who knows a way to make you instantly know languages ? lol 
Now presenting The Man of Steel !!! He now wears sneakers !! 
I have three months to get $150 for my passport . I have one month for the application process ... Dang , I'm screwed ... Well , that's cost of going to Brazil , right ? =) 
I miss < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > to the point that I am considering choco-napping them . -sniffles- Ashelyn Viera Lopez ... Your minion needs you ! I am lost up here ... No direction of who to steal the soul of ... No one around to tell me \MINION ! BRING ME MY GREENS ! And where are my Whorebaits ?! \ " ... No one here to protect me from the evil and crazy < PROPMALE > Moore !!!! " 
My ravioli froze ... 
I HATE my internet ... 5 hours ago I started a download that is supposed to take 10-30 minutes , < PROPMALE > ... It's only at 74% ... Now , I'm not too crazy at math , but I'm sure 5 hours is over 8X longer than it's supposed to take ... Grr 
Missing home ... The soft sand by the shore , the gentle , salty breeze . The city of sounds , lights , and joy . The place I call home . The place I love . 
\I think root beer is just black cream soda . \ " ~ Josh ... Racist . " 
Ungh so bored . What is there to do here ? 
I have some weird friends ... But I love them :D 
Can't sleep ... Wish < PROPMALE > was next to me rather than at work . -sigh- 
Can't wait ' till tomorrow . Going shopping for actual food and then ( maybe ) some Domino's!! I've been craving pizza . =) 
Learning about life sucks . Teaching about life is difficult . Understanding life is almost impossible . Living life ? Worth every second . 
Rawr ... To < PROPFEMALE > ... Because I love my Mistress . And to Ly , because of the bridges . And to < PROPFIRST > because he's mah kunkun the love . But no one loves him . Because he has lady parts . And cooties . 
Lady Antebellum \I Run to You\ " .... Mumford & Sons \ " Little Lion Man\ " .... Two very amazing songs . " 
?????? (Hikari no ) Rock !! <3 Good memories with this song . 
Horrible day , soon to become horrible night . I hate stress so much ! Curse my genetics for the \stress stomach \"." 
It's snowing ! Took a BUNCH of snowy pictures ... =) It was so much fun ! <3 Nice way to relieve some stress and pent up energy . Even though my entire face and hand are FREEZING ! 
I love my friends and my family . They mean the world to me . <3 Stay awesome . Oh , and also , if I magically appear at your doorstep , just accept the cookies . 
Bleach Episode 65 ... >.< I'm sleepy , but I can't fall asleep . 
I was just reminded why I want to be a lawyer so bad . I love debating . Honestly , I need someone to sit with me for a while each day , or at least once a week , and have a nice debate with me about any given topic . I need to brush up my skills , for one . But , also , it's just so damn fun ! Anyone ? 
I've decided that I'm crazy . Who agrees ? 
Can't sleep ... I feel sick to my stomach ... =( 
>.< Does anyone have the cure to all ailments in life yet ? If so , please , pass on the secret . I feel as if my parts of my body don't feel like coexisting with the rest of my body anymore ... =( 
Don't go to Florida if you want sex with a porcupine ... And if you're a guy wearing a strapless dress while having sex with a porcupine ? HOLY CRAP you might be fined $25 ... -_- 
\I am not fat ! I am just skinny deficient ! \"" 
HAHA ! I have beaten writer's block !!! =) I don't know what's with the streak of inspiration , but YAY !!! <3 I got my outlet back . 
Rawr ... making food for a fatty . No , not me . 
Bored ... Can't sleep ... Guess I'll just bug people . =) 
\God must exist because I don't understand how things work . \ " < PROPMALE > Colbert paraphrasing < PROPMALE > O'Reilly . " 
I am not retarded . Hmmph . 
My left eye hurts ... I think I might need new glasses . Either it's gotten better or worse . Well , there goes money out of the \to Brazil\ " fund and into the \ " Seeing\ " fund . " 
What is more important : respect or love ? Would you prefer someone to respect your decision , but hate your guts for it , or love you to pieces , but disrespect your every move , thinking that they know better ? 
I miss Tiger . I keep seeing his pictures on stupid < PROPFIRST>'s albums ... Why do I miss a cat that isn't even mine ? 
O.O I just had a realization !!! \ 
I date very gay men . 
I can't think ... This is a new one for me . I mean , I'm used to always thinking , mainly of stupid stuff , but still thinking . >.> I guess I just have to get straight to the source of the problem and kill it . Tiger/Michael Moore , you should start mourning now . =) 
Siiiiiick .... urgh ... =( 
I won my first ranked Go game !!! <3 Yay !!! 
How can I sleep for 11 hours and be tired 5 hours later ?! Sickness is lame ... =( 
Unhappy Gross-Couples-Making-Out-All-Over-Town Day ! 
Mmmm Chocolate !... Too bad I just brushed my teeth ! =( 
I'm trying out a new philosophy : If you like me , GREAT ! If not , I don't give a damn . 
Bleach 81 ... Bount Arc ... EPIC ! 
Don't you hate it when you stumble upon your elder family members talking about sex casually ? I mean , I know they do it , but it's just so scary ! I think I may need a white jacket and a padded room because of this ... O.O 
Omg , not only is it raining much harder than I have even experienced in California , it's also hailing . Hard . Big Bear sucks . 
\Then I need to hear a lot less conscious and a lot more cajones . \ " ~ Andy from True Blood " 
I give up ... True blood is just too damn expensive to watch . -sigh- It's either you need HBO or money to buy the dvd's . Can't they just put it on Hulu ? Just for the premium customers at least ? They'll still get paid ... sheesh 
I miss Ashelyn Viera Lopez , < PROPFIRST > Palmatier , < PROPFIRST > Eaton , Breezy Perkins , < PROPFEMALE > Dunn , < PROPFIRST > P . Macias , and < PROPFEMALE > Macias Vizcarra !!! =/ 
My dad made me laugh ... Wiped my tears ... Hugged me tight ... Watched me succeed ... Saw me fall ... Cheered me on ... Kept me going strong .... And ... Drove me a little crazy at times ... But dads are a promise from God that you will have a friend forever !... Put this on your status if you had or have a wonderful dad whom you love . 
I miss < PROPFIRST > Federowski !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \ 
Better , < PROPFIRST > ? =) 
Showered , clothed , almost fed , then MORE TRUE BLOOD . =) 
MORE SNOW !!!! Make up your mind , weather . Do you want to rain or snow ? 
Fresh Caesar salad , some juice , and cookies after . Yum . The storm outside is kinda freaking me out . :/ It's hailing/snowing and the hail is sometimes as big as a fist . -shivers- 
OMG ! It's snowing so hard ! When I open my door , snow almost comes inside ! and the snow looks like dippen ' dots !! =) MAYBE I'll take more pictures !

Talking to my SISTER !!! 
Rawr : 1 ) \I love you\ " In dinosaur . 2 ) \ " Hello 
My favorite thing to do ? Smile . Not only does it make people around me feel happier , it makes me feel good too . And if I can pass the smile on , that's even better . \ 
No , I am not gay , high , drunk . I did not hit my head , lose mass amounts of blood , or have some other mind-affecting trauma . And , no , I have not been abducted , body switched , or mind controlled . I just like seeing people smile . 
\kimi wa hitori janai\ 
Why are all my adds in Spanish ?! I learned nothing in Camacho's ... 
Can't sleep . Home sick . I miss the waves and the sea air . I miss the crowds of people ( not the tourists . I do NOT miss them ) . I miss a home cooked meal made by mom . Can't wait to be home , IB . 
I finished the first book in the Sword of Truth series at exactly 1:00 AM . Now I need to order book #2 ... I really like the first book and recommend it to you readers who are in between books/series , looking for something new , or just plain bored . 
Not feeling good ... Tummy pains suck . Watching mildly humorous movies , reading a mildly interesting book , and wishing to talking to people . 
AHHH ! THE FLYING MONKEYS !! THEY ATTAAAAAACK ! 
That feeling you get when you write a new poem =) Amazing . 
My dad is coming to visit me in April !! YAY ! I'm excited ! =) <3 
Can't stop hiccuping ! GR ! 
\Haikus are easy\ 
Pandora Radio . My savior when my music gets repetitive ! =) 
< PROPMALE > screwed up my world ... And not in the good way . I think I might need therapy .

I'm the type of girl who makes her guy a sammich everyday . And is he grateful ?! NO ! 
Yay !!! BACK HOME IN 10 DAYS !!! So excited ? Who's throwing my welcome back party ? ME ! Everyone who likes cake and loves me is invited . =) 
\ P.S. I love you . Forever and today . \ " <3 " 
I can no longer live off of sandwiches , cereal , and top ramen ... Enough already ! I miss my mommy's cooking ! =( 
9 Days until I walk on my blessed beach again !!! Can't wait ! <3 
I Miss You- Blink 182 . My song for < PROPFEMALE > Procopio ! <3 
8 Days !!! <3 
If you could ask an all powerful being for anything , what would it be ? ( I'm in the mood for a debate , or intellectual conversation ... ) 
You know , I always wanted to take dance lessons . Spanish dance lessons . I would love to actually be able to dance when I'm being a dork in the privacy of my own home . xD 
Six more days ... Six more days until I get to smell the sea air , slap my brother upside the head , hug my mother , see my close friends ... Six more days until I go back to being a D&D nerd who plays Magic , Halo , and Overlord . YAY !!!! 
Don't feel good ... I have a headache and my body aches , like I just had a really good work out without any water ... 
< PROPMALE > thinks I should go find Bon Jovi and marry him ... @_@ He's older than my dad ! >.< 
Apparently , the Sandman forgot to visit my house tonight . >.> Sleeping on the job ? Not cool ... 
SIBLING WAR !!! Copy this if you are the best and smartest of your siblings . If this stands an hour without your brothers and sisters protesting then it's true ...... \ 
( If < PROPMALE > comments , I still win because he'll be hearing from a certain moose soon , if he challenges me ... xD ) 
5 more days !!! <3 Ah , can't wait to see my Mistress again ! I have been lost without your feathery goodness , Ashelyn Viera Lopez ! 
Good night the world of Facebook ! When I wake up tomorrow , I will be one day closer to seeing the love of my life : < PROPFEMALE > ! xD 
Arrrghhhh ... My back hurts ! I'm in desperate need of a good massage and a warm bath . 
Sweet ! New phone in a few weeks ! Can't wait ! \ 
And snowboarding on the 15th , right before I leave !! Best going away present from Big Bear !! haha 
3 days , 1 hour , and 17 minutes until I get to see my love , Ashelyn Viera Lopez , my closest friend , < PROPFIRST > Palmatier , my sister , Breezy Perkins , and my party animal , < PROPFIRST > Federowski !! xD 
Rawr ... Yes , it is early in the morning . No , that doesn't mean anything to me . No , you don't care . Yes , I just wasted ten seconds of you life . ;D 
Congratulations , mom ! I'm so happy for you ! I'm glad you didn't give up . =) Yay !!! A bunch of stress is lifted ! 
A lot of stress has melted away , going home in 3 days , might have a job lined up , getting my permit soon , getting a new phone ... -kicks back- Life is definitely looking up . =) 
Huge surprise alert : I fell flat on my face when there was nothing in my way . 
Ow ow ow ow ow ow OWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW !!!!!!!!!!!!! \ 
Stupid pole ... =( 
Gravity really wants me to become close friends with the floor . I disagree . The floor always hurts me . =( 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > and I are going to beat up Gravity for always bringing us down . =) 
Who was surprised ? It's so good to be HOME !!!! <3<3<3 I missed IB so much ! Well , anyone want to < PROPFEMALE > out tomorrow ? Today's < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPMALE > . =) 
T_T < PROPFIRST > came and left and I still didn't get to meet < PROPFIRST > . What a waste of a week ! 
The easiest way to get unstressed ? Eat junk food and play a cage match in Halo3 : Mythic . < PROPFIRST > P . Macias you're AMAZING at map creation . 
So let me get this straight ............ Kelsey Grammer can end a 15 yr marriage by phone , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > can be on divorce #9 , < PROPFEMALE > Spears had a 55 hour marriage , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > and Tiger Woods , while married , were having sex with EVERYONE , 53% of Americans get divorced and 30-60% cheat on their spouses . Yet , same-sex marriage is going to destroy the institution of marriage ? Really ? Re-post if you find this ironic . 
Rain brings new beginnings . I think this storm's timing is highly accurate . 
< PROPMALE > eats junk food , never exercises , and drinks only soda for 3 months . He loses 21 pounds . I do the same thing , for 2 months , and lose 5 . People should try this diet !!! 
Poetry ... Why have you abandoned me now ? ='(

Lvl 15 in less than 2 days ... Wow , I have no life .
