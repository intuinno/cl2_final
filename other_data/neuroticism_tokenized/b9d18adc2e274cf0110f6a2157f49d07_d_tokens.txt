< PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone ! 
got Team Fortress 2 . If it works , don't expect me to be online for the next week . xDD 
found out that her computer will NOT in fact run TF2 . :/ Guess I'm gonna have to be a fandom addict for a little while longer . 
wants to know what would happen if we dragged someone from 1968 to our own time . xD Cause the way this story I'm reading is going , it'd be hilarious . 
is totally jealous that Halle is watching District 9 . >.> Such an epic movie ... 
Just walked in the door to my house from a nice long FIVE DAY trip . xD I miss you Metronites with a PASSION and wish you guys could've seen Beale Street and the game with me . Speaking of the game , KNIGHT WIN HELL YEAH . Thanks to < PROPFEMALE > and it's fans for such a great game . We promise to be a bit nicer to you next time . ;] 
only wants to go to school for about ten minutes tomorrow to see her friends . :/ 
is currently laughing at \Meet The Crashes . \ " XDD I love that video ... "

had a freakin ' awesome time with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > yesterday . <3 
wants to go out walking but it's too bloody humid . >.> WTF FLorida . WTF .

is in a really weird writing mood . :/ 
now really wants to read , \I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream . \ " Was written back in 1967 and I STILL want to read it . Doesn't help that the most disturbing piece of fiction that I have ever seen come out of a fandom was based on said short story ... " 
is wondering where my muse went and why it came back and decided to be useful again . :/ All of a sudden this new voice I've been trying to use is .... working ! 
spent most of this past hour trying to figure out the notes for the \Rocket Jump Waltz\ " piano arrangement . I'm never gonna get this left hand part ... this needs to be a duet ! " 
just got back from the gym . I feel better now . <3 
only recently realized that she's going to be 18 in about three days . March 2nd , ftw ! 
is incredibly proud of herself . I know some of my friends work with big sewing projects , but last night , I made myself a full face mask reminicent of the Spy's . I gotta say .... I'm REALLY pleased with how it came out ! 
needs to calm down . xD 
needs to know if anyone has one of those toy revolvers ... I can't find one ANYWHERE . 
is in an insanely good mood after this morning's loathing of class . xD I think tomorrow I'm gonna bring a tape measure to musical theater practice and take the measurements I need for my new mask while I'm waiting to go on stage . 
is totally watching the Ghost Hunters live event tonight at 9 . Whoo , I'll be doing homework at the same time ! XD

is thrilled to have the day off of school today . Maybe I'll be able to set some order back into my life . XD 
loves parodies . I will never stop listening to this song Halle , thanks a lot ! XDD 
loved that she has officially mind haxored < PROPFIRST>'s mind . xDDD ALLLLWAYS I WANNA BE WITH YOU ~ XDD 
believes wholeheartedly that Scout can sing better than Ke$ha . XD It's amazing how much fun I'm having with this song . 
So the fam damnly says that my dress WASN'T the ugliest thing on the planet . Good to know ! XD Back from the Music Man , whoot ! 
.... I hate Medics . I hate them DEAD . 
Some people I < PROPFEMALE > out with are the kind of people that I want to spend every hour of the day with because we have so much fun . With other people , sometimes I feel like I'm just the stand-in . 
thinks she's getting sick . D: All of a sudden I got really warm and my head feels like it's stuffed with cotton . And all with only a day before Spring Break . FML . 
so the guy that did the Old Spice commercials was just on an interview with Oprah . xDD 
Happy Easter everyone . I wish upon you the maximum possible amount of chocolate and sugary candies ! 
thinks Halle has ' teh 1337 hax ' because she showed me how to fix my computer ! :D 
is excited to be heading out with Halle and crew to the fair tomorrow . I'm really hoping to find a decent hat there . C'mon < PROPMALE > County , don't fail me now ! 
went to the fair . Rode only in the blue seats on the rides . OH YEAH . 
off to the beach with the Kyles . As much as I hate bathing suit season , I'm excited ! XD 
has so many things to do and yet has no < PROPFEMALE > to do any of them . Guess that means I'm going to the gym . xD 
went to St. < PROPFIRST > , came home to watch a bit of a Ustream , went to dinner , went to Relay for Life , went to go see How To Train Your Dragon again and then came home to new Cuanta < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > . Yesterday was pretty much awesome . 
is gonna be headed to Grad Bash later . Maaan , a day with the Kyles + Mountain Dew = ..... I'm not even sure yet . xD 
KYTRI IS SELLING T-SHIRTS OMG ! Also , new < PROPFEMALE > of CV ! 
Just watched the new RvB episode .... Church scared the everloving crap out of me with that whole , \WASHINGTON ! \ " thing .... " 
MGM = best anti-prom EVER . Nuff said . 
AP Lit exam today . Good luck to everyone else joining me in that ! XD Frankly , I'm terrified .

thinks its too nice of a day to be stuck in home all day . I wanna go on a walk .... 
wants to go to Avenues Mall today , for some reason . :/ 
is watching Kytri's Ustream . Apparently , last week someone came up with the phrase \Jarate Lounge\ " to describe the bathroom . ..... I want a sign .... " 
is sick of HAVING to do things . Can't I get a day where everything is done and I get to decide for myself what is important ? 
has a doctor's appointment today . XP I think the Scout said this best ; \I HATE doctas ! \ " \ 
just killed about three hours devouring Chasing Fire . Not done yet , but I will die if Mockingjay does not come out soon . 
IS IT EPCOT TIME YET ?! D: 
wants to know why , when I check Facebook religiously for days nothing happens but when I'm off for a couple of hours , all of a sudden stuff goes down ? What the heck is that ? 
considering a bike ride . Hm .... 
Today was a good day . Very productive .... a triumph , you might say . >:] 
had an absolutely fantastic time making amazing memories with Halle , B . and M while screwing around Epcot , having pool ( poo ' ) parties , riding bumper boats ( and cars ) and ultimately being downright awesome . We'll miss you guys and can't wait to see you at the next con ! And by the way , we never DID work on the A Million Ways dance . xD 
has good music on her iPod now ! Thanks Halle for the awesome songs . xD Mr. Blue Sky is currently playing on repeat . 
suddenly remembers why she hated IE . >.> But at least I've got my computer back . 
Hey you with the pretty face\ 
Welcome to the human race\ 
A celebration , mister blue sky's up there waitin'\ 
And today is the day we've waited for . <3 
So despite the fact that I didn't go anywhere or have anyone call me to do stuff today , it was a productive day . Finished my math placement exam for UCF , devoured a good chunk of \The Gargoyle\ " and worked on my balaclava finally . ^^ Now it's off to the banquet . " 
has \Welcome To The Jungle\ " and \ " Don't Stop Me Now\ " stuck in her head like WHOA . I love all of this music so much . It's SOOO much better than what comes outta the speakers nowadays . " 
So Halle bought Bioshock today and we started playing .... we may not be working on our cosplays for another few days . xD 
just started reading House of Leaves . I've gotta say , I'm only about 28 pages in but this book is already starting to make me a little twitchy .... 
wants to know why we don't have something like Eurovision here in the US . They look like they have so much fun .... 
is rereading Cuanta < PROPFEMALE > . D'AWW < PROPFIRST > , YOU'RE SO CUTE . And I always knew I missed the old RED Spy , but I didn't quite know HOW much until just now . T.T 
As frustrating as this day has been , I'm so glad I went to school . Thanks to < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > and Halle for making an otherwise horrendous day awesome again ! 
WHAT . WHAAAT . Kytri put more stuff on her shop INCLUDING buttons one of which has < PROPFEMALE > on it . OH MY GOD . I WANT IT SO BAD IT'S NOT EVEN FUNNY ! 
Ohhhh lawd . I know it's too early in the morning when I start trying to sing Mr. Blue Sky and instead start singing , \Hey there Mr. BLU Spy . \ " XD " 
KYTRI'S STREAMING TONIGHT , OMG !!! 
Ahahah , Kytri's comic update ustream is playing Tenacious D . I forgot how much I loved them . xDD 
is no longer a student at Fleming Island High . Hello Oppertunity , hug me back ; it's time that you and I met . 
had an awesome time this weekend hanging out with all of her friends . Thank you guy so much for all of the fun times ; even with all of the hell that we had to deal with , I'm so glad you guys were there ! <3 
So I leave for one day and of COURSE , the TF2 blog updates . Team Fortress 2 is officially on for the < PROPMALE > . It's a free play weekend . And the game is 50% off online . \ 
\ 
AND I'M STUCK IN < PROPMALE > . WHAT IS THIS ? 
just got back from Orientation . THANK GOD . xD 
just got chased home by a < PROPFEMALE > . Like legitimately . It chased me down the street leading into my neighborhood . I hate bees . > < 
NEW < PROPFEMALE > NEW < PROPFEMALE > NEW < PROPFEMALE > NEW < PROPFEMALE > !!! 
just saw one of the trailers for Portal 2 . Oh man , I won't ever stop \ 
loving Valve's top notch animating style . And there's no shortage in \ 
great dialogue either . \I think we can put the past behind us . For \ 
feels somewhat accomplished . The Huntsman is all put together and lookin ' sharp , we've got a FULL TF2 group following us to Metro now , and tomorrow is gonna end up being another work day for the Ambassador . Let's do this ! 
had her night improved by the new EnigmaEvocative video . TOUCH YOUR GUN . XDD Dear lord , I didn't know I could laugh that hard ! 
has a smoothie for breakfast . <3 Good feelings all around ! 
saw Lithe-Fider's Beta BLU Spy and is honestly contemplating how to make a pair of pinstriped pants . D: Well , that and if resin casting a butterfly knife is a good idea if you've never done it before ! XD 
Oh TF2chan . You never cease to crack me up . 
Toy Story 3 , the pool and now Kytri's ustreaming . Today was a good day . 
Come away , come away from all these things unheard . If a chosen word has you concerned , then it's a lesson learned . - < PROPFIRST > Mraz , Hey Love 
So . Just saw the Transformers : War For Cybertron E3 Trailer . .... It's worth it . Holy crap it looks FANTASTIC ! 
just got back from an epic gym trip . Thanks Halle ; you're the only person in the entire world that could keep me on that machine for more than an hour without noticing it ! XD And make me feel ten times better in the process ! 
thinks having this much fun should be illegal . We've got four weeks to Metrocon . Let's do this . >:] 
Oh man , Kytri's Ustreaming again ! o_0 
Ustream , goin ' up . HEEEYA ! 
I think Red is sweet 
Converting to RED in 5 ..... 4 ...... 3 ...... 2 ...... 1 
< PROPFIRST>'s been hacking my Facebook . If you see anything about me being a damned , dirty RED , it's all him and IT'S A LIE . JUST LIKE CAKE . 
I am purple ...... All shall fear the midle corororrr 
So I'm trying to get something out of the fridge for lunch and the butter dish flies out of the side of the door , tries to attack me and shatters into a bazillion pieces on the floor . I THINK MY HOUSE IS HAUNTED . xD 
just finished There Will Be Brawl . Is it bad that I laughed at the end ? XD < PROPFIRST > = Miyamoto ! 
Valve , this is why I love you . New comic out on the TF2 blog . Engineer update comic . Excuse me while I < PROPFEMALE > over this newly developed awesome . 
I'm the only person I know that can break glasses while SEWING . I mean , jeeze ... 
just found someone who has drawn out the engraving of the Ambassador . ILU Deviantart . ILU . 
Thanks a lot guys , for the awesome party tonight . Today was a good day and I'm so glad I got to spend it with all of you . ~ <3 Happy 4th of July and I can't wait until the 23rd ! 
Alright . Yeah . I'm okay with life right now . :] Petty jabs and comments included . 
Internet's out over here until Thursday . I'm on mom's iPhone just to check updates for a bit . Text or call me if you need to get ahold of me . I'm gonna be bored for a while . XD 
Whoo , internet's back ! 
is totally and utterly in love with < PROPFEMALE>'s \Good Ole Fashioned Lover Boy . \ " <3 " 
Whooo ... gotta love people who judge by stereotype . Way to go internet ! 
just spent the last few hours sewing pinstripes onto a pair of pants and I'm not even halfway done yet . I gotta say , this is one of the most tedious things I have ever attempted . To you sewing gurus out there , I don't know how you do it . 
Thanks a lot Halle . xD That song Electric Worry is stuck in my head now . Epic ~ 
So I'm really , REALLY enjoying Soul Eater . <3 
is currently in some undisclosed location in < PROPFEMALE > at a random Holiday Inn . I honestly have no idea where I am right now ... xD 
now knows where she is ! She's in Macon ...... Makin ' Bacon . ;D 
going shopping today at Blue Ridge . Got a few things I'm hoping to find but it should be a nice little trip . Then back to the cabin to finish up the pinstripes ! 
found a cigarette case that I can use as a prop and FINALLY finished all of the pinstripes on the first pant leg . xD Today was a good day ! 
This is the worst day EVER . The new CV update is literally making me cry . T.T I just wanna lay in bed all day and sleep . 
was almost done with the pinstripes before I realized I didn't have enough thread . FML . >.< 
can't stop watching Soul Eater ! XD 
is finally home . Ah , it's good to be back . <3 
So Lord Death is voiced by the same guy who did the Elder in Chrono Crusade , < PROPFIRST > Swasey . I KNEW I knew that voice . xD 
SOUL EATER ! *_* This show is going to eat my life . I love it ... love it so much . I've never enjoyed watching something this much before . 
thinks a certain pink-haired meister needs a serious dose of TLC . T.T Poor Crona ... 
had the greatest time at Metro this year . It was SO much fun meeting all of the wonderful people there and getting to see some old friends . XD Congrats to B . and M . for their win ! You guys TOTALLY deserved it ! 
Oh LAWD , why am I in such a good mood ? I don't even know . It must be from all of the amazing people we met this weekend who continue to be EVEN MORE AMAZING . <3 
OH GOD WHAT ? CUANTA < PROPFEMALE > UPDATED AGAIN ?!!!!! 
just finished drafting probably the cutest freaking doll pattern I've ever seen . I'm super excited to start using this one ! 
found the absolute CUTEST fabric at < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE>'s today and intends to make a purse with it . Who needs designer purses that reach into the hundreds ? Mine's gonna have Waka on it . >:] 
News for all Metronites ; the marker on my back finally came off . XD 
If I can ever make someone react to my writing as much as I have while reading this fic , I might be satisfied with my life . Gotta love someone who can tell a good story . 
The one word that can get any men to stop arguing and listen ; bacon . Oh Spy , you're so smart . xD 
just got back from Universal ... my head is still kinda reeling from the sheer amount of awesome that was the < PROPMALE > Potter Ride . That and I think we went on almost every coaster at least once , so I'm still kinda feeling like I'm doing flips . Anyway , it was a fun and wonderful adventure with Halle and the Kyles . LET'S DO IT AGAIN SOMETIME ! 
So I'm thinking about going to see < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim tomorrow . Anyone wanna join me ? 
should not be allowed on the internet . WHY IS IT SO EASY FOR ME TO FALL INTO FANDOMS ?! D: Great . Now I'm looking at reddish orange wigs on Ebay . T.T 
Why is it that every time I'm trying to read House of Leaves , someone interrupts me ? IT'S DENSE ENOUGH WITHOUT ME LOOSING MY PLACE EVERY FIVE MINUTES ! XD 
Deviantart just gave me at least six or seven pictures of crossovers of my two current fandoms . I'm good for life now , kthanx . 
So I came home from college shopping to find a new computer sitting on my chair . With a better graphics card . AND A KEYBOARD THAT ACTUALLY HAS A \P\ " key . It runs like the wind . I am pleased . <3 " 
is in a pretty good mood . Just checked over my schedule again and realized that it's not as crazy as I thought . New computer , good friends , and a plan . Let's DO this ! 
about to shut off this Goliath and head out . < PROPMALE > , ho ! And as < PROPFIRST > once infamously put it , \That's my set ! Peace out ! \ " XD " 
FINALLY GOT INTERNET HERE AT THE DORM . xD I'm a happy girl . 
Double rainbow at band today . It was amazing . xD Even the direction made a comment about it . 
\But little by little 
is officially a UCF Marching Knight . WHO ARE WE ? MARCHING KNIIIIIIIIIGHTS ! AND WHERE ARE WE FROM ? U-C-F ! GO KNIGHTS ! 
Band camp is officially over ! Thanks to all of the trombones who decided NOT to tell us the schedule was wrong and in fact made it the best surprise of the week ! XD 
Oooh , Kytri is Ustreaming tonight . ^^ 
had an awesome time at dinner with the trombones and our assorted entourage . XD This section can't possibly get any better . 
First day of classes tomorrow . I hope it goes well . xD 
really wants to write something but is having trouble starting it . D: HALLE . I NEED YOUR OPINION ON SOMETHING < PROPMALE > WOULD DO KTHNX ! 
had another awesome time with the trombone section . Seriously , I don't think anyone in the band is as cool as they are . You guys really helped the transition into college for me , like more then you'll EVER know . <3 GO BONES ! 
got an idea for < PROPFEMALE>'s story and I gotta say , if I can pull it off , it's gonna be pretty wicked . xD 
TF2 for a bit this morning ( still wish I could play Spy . D: ) , gym here in a few , a fifteen or twenty minute cheer session with the band and a trombone party tonight . All in all , not a bad day . XD 
Kytri's streaming and I honestly am more excited about the fact that Halle posted . This is awesome . xDDD 
So I need a lab coat for Chemistry and I was about a second away from asking if I could just wear a Medic coat and be done with it . Because really , how cool would that be ? XD 
is in love with Choo Choo Ch'boogie . Like for real , I wouldn't have found this song without my Survey of Rock music class and it's so amazing . xD 
Whoo ! Highlander Mix-Up Match in about half an hour ! XD I'm excited to watch Valve get owned by the pros and pubbers . This should be fuuuun ~ 
GAME DAAAAAY ~ I know it's only South < PROPFEMALE > but LET'S GO KNIGHTS ! So freaking excited ... 
' s first game as a UCF Marching Knight was a success . < PROPFIRST>'s here , Halle's coming down tomorrow ; this weekend just keeps getting better . <3 
Sometimes , leaving an insult alone for the irony is so much more satisfying then making an actual comeback . XD 
I wish I could draw a bit better . I have an entire Scout-centric story/music video/collab thing that I wish I could draw out because it's been stuck in my head for AGES . FFFFF- 
So I'm thinking about Halloween ( yes already ) and I'm debating between a < PROPMALE > , a Smoker , a Witch or a Splicer . The ones I want to do most are the Witch or a Splicer . Any ideas guys ? 
Kytri's new comic featuring Gabry and Liam just launched . OH < PROPFEMALE > , IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU BACK ! ;_; 
If there is one thing that I hate more then this doing this online chemistry stuff , it's doing it on a slow connection . * RAAAAAGE * 
Oh Valve . I see what you did there . Sticking that Heavy figure on < PROPFIRST>'s desk in the comic . Sneaky , sneaky . 
Well , that's it . My phone has officially gone completely nuts . When I slide it open , the screen goes completely black . Meanwhile , if I close it , I can see the screen . >.< I loathe this stupid thing .... 
An entire day of math .... at least I only have one problem left now , but I gotta ask about that stupid thing tomorrow . 
Drawing again . It's a bittersweet feeling . On one hand , it's fun and relaxing and I really enjoy it . On the other hand , it reminds me of why I write more then I draw . xD 
I've determined the one thing that will always make me laugh , even when I scowling at math homework ; listening to the domination lines of Solly , Engie , Demo and Scout . XD Oh god , I'm dying . 
The screen on my phone is now perpetually black . I can't read texts anymore or even know who is calling me . Or even if I missed a call . If you need to get ahold of me , send me a message on Facebook and I'll get it eventually . :/ 
You never forget your first Doctor . \ 
Alright Maddi . Alright < PROPFIRST > . You win . Doctor Who is amazing . xD Just got back from an all day Who marathon with some awesome Marching Knight buddies and we went through the entire season with the 9th Doctor . Gotta say , I really dug it . 
I knew I'd like Ten . <3 On to episode twoooo ~ 
I really should go to the library more ; I'm more productive there for some reason , and much less tempted to pull up another episode of Doctor Who . 
I officially LOVE my Survey of Rock class . My teacher is amazing . I couldn't pick a topic for my final paper so I went to him for help . I walked out of the class with instructions to listen to Quadrophenia and < PROPFIRST > by The Who and to watch < PROPFIRST > if I could get my hands on it . I'm so excited to write this paper . <3 
Even though the chem lab went long again today , it was just a lot of waiting around ; got to know some of my group better and it turns out one of them is a huge Super Junior/Girls ' Generation fan , so we spent some time talking about Japanese/Korean dramas and bands . xD And then I find out that < PROPFIRST > got TF2 ! TODAY IS A GOOD DAY ! 
OH MY GOD . xDD They put ELO's \ Mr. Blue Sky\ " in this Doctor Who episode . I'm in love ~ " 
< PROPFIRST > is coming out with a new album tomorrow . Be still my heart ~ ! <3 
Tried my hand at crafting today . Got Your Eternal Reward . >:] Now , if only I had time to use it ... 
Studying for that chem test . I'm a bit worried because it's all coming fairly well to me .... means that something's gonna be on that test that I honestly won't know . XP 
HEADING HOME LIKE NOW . XD I'm packing to get home to Jacksonville ! BRB IN LIKE TWO AND A HALF HOURS ! 
Finally home . It's so weird here . o_0 
Found my 7th and 8th Chrono Crusade books as I left the house yesterday . *_* It's a good series when I can open up to the last few pages of the 8th book and immediately begin to cry . 
Tonight has just been further proof that I have the coolest , most amazing friends in the history of ever . Case closed . 
Well , that chem test went better then it did the first time . At least I finished . ^^ 
You know what's boring ? Calculus . >.< At least I'm understanding these problems in the book .... 
Got a < PROPMALE > to wear my new < PROPFEMALE > shoes and they DIDN'T hurt my feet ! Now some chem lab , calc review at two and grocery shopping later . Not a bad day . 
FFF HELL YES ! I just got the results back for my second chem test . 95 , whoot ! XD And I went to a calc review today , so hopefully I'll do good tomorrow too . =D 
So I'm going through the test I just took in Calc .... and I've realized that I hate it EVEN MORE because it's online . If someone had been grading it and saw the work I did , I would have gotten partial credit on EVERYTHING I got wrong in the system . * Sigh * Oh well . 
The best way to start a morning you had to get up wicked early for ? A nice half hour of the Doctor to make everything better . :D 
< PROPMALE > Horror was amazing , for those who care . In the same night , they made both a joke about Megacon and catgirls and used Doctor Who in a callback . Made . My . Life . XD 
Bah , saying goodbye is always the hardest part . Still , a petticoat , a < PROPMALE > Horror show and six hours on Skype later , this weekend was beyond amazing . Best of all , it reminded me how many people and how much love I have in my life . Even after all of the people that faded out of my life . I'm blessed . I'm so , so blessed . I love and miss all of you . <3 
Doing some research = watching a movie . I love my survey of rock class . XD 
TF2 HALLOWEEN UPDATE ? YES PLEASE . <3 
So my phone is acting up again , really bad this time . Anyone needs to get ahold of me , I'll be on facebook most of tonight . >.< 
Happy Halloween everyone ! I hope everyone has more to do then I do . XD 
Did some research on Quad and < PROPFIRST > for my paper , have an outline for the presentation , did my final < PROPFEMALE > service learning class , started drawing a picture of Cellix that I'm actually sorta kinda pleased with , spent 40 minutes on DDR , am caught up in all of my work and realized that I've smiled and laughed more at the littlest things since I got here . I think today was a good day . <3 
Just finished Midnight from Doctor Who ... and all I can say is the preview for the next few episodes is like , \Whuuut ? \"" 
Ah winter . You have finally come and you bring with you the nostalgia of an age . ~ <3 Cold weather always encourages my creative spirit . 
First I get out of lab really early and now band gets out at 7:45 ? This may very well be the best day this week . XD Not only that , I GET TO WEAR PANTS TO BAND AND NOT DIE WHOOO ! 
So I wanna go thrifting today but I have no one to go with . T.T 
Chemistry got canceled this morning , I < PROPMALE > out with some friends from that class and I know what I'm doing for Christmas presents for all of my besties . <3 Today is going to be a good day ! 
It's amazing how much we take for granted . Beauty is such a powerful thing . And I never noticed how beautiful a flag could be . <3 
Happy Veteran's Day , to all of those that have served , will serve and are serving . \ 
We are blessed to have you all . \

Just got back from spending about an hour and a half in < PROPFEMALE>'s . Got some felt , lace and ribbon to finish up < PROPFEMALE > and then start on little Russia ~ 
So I have a little < PROPFEMALE > singing on my computer desktop . My life has been made . <3 XD 
It's official ; no band practice next Wednesday ! I'm goin ' home ! 
has the HORRIBLY CRIPPLING < PROPFEMALE > to go to St. < PROPFIRST > ! D: Curse you St. < PROPFIRST > Street and your wonderful awesomeness . T.T 
Good luck to Eagle Band ONE ! at State today ! I know you guys are gonna freakin ' KILL ' em ! <3 Also , have a little of the Tropicana Bowl lemonade for me ; it's quite possibly the most delicious thing on the planet . 
As pointless as today's performance was , I'm glad we did because it led to an entire day of hanging out with the trombones . ;D 
Thank god for all of my new music . If I didn't have it , I wouldn't have survived today . @_@ Marukaite chikyuu .... 
Thanks to < PROPMALE > Gifford for inviting me to that music forum ; it made that calculus test SO MUCH BETTER . 
So if an entire class fails a test , doesn't that indicate that something about the style of teaching ISN'T WORKING ? Because apparently my calc teacher thinks it's our fault . * sigh * Today has been pretty awful because of that class , but I don't know what to do except keep moving forward . 
Well , my paper is printed out and completed . 9 pages later and I've still got a ton of studying to do . Oi . XD At least I've still got my music . It's the only thing that's kept my spirits so high . <3 
I love my section . Just saying . <3 
Let's Go Knights ! No one can stop us . You know why ? \ 
Cause we're a FORCE-A-NATURE . 
And the Knights are headed to the < PROPFEMALE > Bowl ! It's a great week for the UCF Nation ! 
Alright , game day over . Time to get down to work for finals . So far , so good . 
Studying for Survey of Rock with Halle Friedman . This is probably the best kind of studying EVER . 
Despite all of the finals despair , this had to be a really , really spectacular day . I spent most of it studying with Halle and then I found out I'm gonna be able to make a very special trip/reunion with the Metronites . I'm so blessed to have such amazing friends . <3 LOVE YOU ALL . 
1/3 finals = done . Who's next ? >:] 
So hungry . < PROPFEMALE > lazy . What a dilemma . 
So I feel like a scientist guys . I wanted pancakes this morning so I started throwing everything in a bowl and got the egg and the mix into the bowl before I realized we had no milk . So what did I do ? I experimented and somehow the pancakes came out just like they usually do . 8D Good start to the morning I'd say . 
Only one more exam until my semester ends ~ ! Too bad that last one is calculus . XD -stressstressstress- 
So the honors college has a writing contest going on and one of the categories is fiction and another is poetry . Does ... does anyone think it would be a good idea to submit that little thing I wrote the other day , just for kicks ? Is it accessible enough for people who don't know what it's about ? And is it poetry or prose ? o_0 I dunno , I just thought it might be kinda cool to actually enter a writing contest ... 
Best song to listen to before going to take a Calculus exam ? \Make It Mine\ " by < PROPFIRST > Mraz . <3 Time to go show this test exactly what I'm made of ! " 
So the book I rented can't be returned today because the store is closed . >.> Guess I'm going home tomorrow .... 
I just had a HUGE slice of home made pumpkin bread . Oh yeah , I'm home . <3 
is headed to the gym if any of the local crew wants to join me . 
Good news - I totally passed calculus and my GPA is still in tact . \ 
Bad news - I'm getting sick . >.> \ 
Best news - Metronite Party / take over of Busch Gardens is in 10 days . > : D 
To my Skype crew : it looks like Skype is having an issue today and mine's not wanting to work . So if ya'll need to get ahold of me , today it's gonna have to be AIM or FB . :/ 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone ! XD I'll be celebrating mine a day later , but I hope everyone has a good rest of the week what with leftovers and messing with new gadgets . I personally will be jamming to Muchacha Kiss Kiss Bang . Because I'm that bloody festive . xD 
Holy crap . Holycrapholycrapholycrap Metronites . It's tomorrow . TOMORROW . What is this I don't even . I don't know how I'm sitting still long enough to type this . SO EXCITED . <3 
Spent the entire day cutting out fabric pieces , playing DDR and Guess Who , and making up choreography to Muchacha Kiss Kiss Bang with two of my best friends . <3 Today was a wonderful day . 
That's it . Exactly half of Muchacha Kiss Kiss Bang is choreographed . There are no words to describe how excited I am . <333 
Back at the dorm and back to the grind . I miss my family , my team and my Spain so badly already ! T.T 
I love that I have one Monday class and it ends at 10:20 . <3 
Good news : My calculus class looks very , VERY promising this semester and I got to see some wonderful Okamiden footage today . <3 \ 
Bad news : Said footage also contained clips of the little mini Waka character Kurow . He speaks with like a surfer/valley girl/Poland accent ! D: I MISS THE FRENCH GAIZ . 
Dors , < PROPFEMALE > mal est passé et tu entres dans la danse\ 
< PROPFEMALE > pire de côté , < PROPFEMALE > revende en cadence ~ . \ 
Thank you Devian < PROPFEMALE > rt for the glorious song . <3 
\How do I feel at the end of the day ? ( Are you sad because you're on your own ? ) No I get by with a little help from my friends . \ " \ 
After an amazing weekend , it's back to logarithms and psychology texts . :/ But at least I have a reason to celebrate . Happy birthday to Gil ~ ! 
Found a 50% off coupon for < PROPFEMALE>'s in my inbox today . I have my plans for later ~ 
O-Town is about to get OWNED by this storm ... 
It's been a long , long , LONG time since I took a couple hours to work on a picture and finish it . It's a nice change . <3 
This morning I walked out of chemistry in a huge slump about my major : not knowing if it was the right one for me or if I was just doing it because I could , not because I wanted to . I just walked out of my forensics class after we had the lead detective of the homicide unit speak today and I can happily say that I've forgotten all of those earlier worries . <3 
Chemistry done , math taken care of . I guess it's time to hit the gym . XD 
Boring day is boring . So what do I do ? I have to of course st < PROPMALE > on a long < PROPMALE > endeavor that includes sewing and painting . What am I gonna do with me ? 
I should be working on a chemistry lab . What am I doing ? Researching the Battle of Garigliano . And I haven't had a formal history class in a year . \ 
I adore this fandom . <3 
Congrats to my brother for his 1st runner up in Poetry Out Loud ! I haven't seen the video yet but I keep hearing how awesome it was . Good goin ' Dan ~ ! 
So we had a CSA come to our forensics class today to talk to us about what she does . Not only was I fairly certain that she was exactly like me at my age , but I also got to see some ... graphic images of on-the-job cases . And I can honestly say that zombie video games are doing dead people justice . I KNOW I've seen some of those people in Left 4 Dead . >.> 
If you guys haven't had a < PROPMALE > to read the newest TF2 update on the blog , go check it out . xD I was dying a little at the Scout dialogue . 
You know , it may seem silly how much inspiration I can draw from one person's casual little blog . It's not . Thank you < PROPFIRST > , for snapping a new focus on my camera lens called perception . <3 
I don't wanna hear a DAMN word from people about my fandom : I just took a quiz in forensics after at least half of the class read the wrong chapter , myself included , and I got one of the questions right because I knew the Chinese empire went back further than 3,000 years . DAMN STRAIGHT . 
The bad - I got soaked on the way to class and had to sit for two hours in calc II as a shivering little ball . \ 
The good - I am now enjoying hot tea and pierogis . <3 
Super jealous that < PROPFIRST > O'Donnell and < PROPMALE > Conway are going to Epcot today . T.T 
Anyone got any ideas on what to do around here ? I'm so bored and I don't want to sit at home all day ... 
Hey Orange Park peeps . Guess who is sitting in her room here on Fleming Island RIGHT NOW ? =D 
Dear little shitheads in the < PROPFEMALE > teal car driving around Black Creek that thought it was funny to yell ' ugly bitch ' at me as I was walking home , \ 
What's with all the spiteful hatred ? If you had wanted to know the secret of why I'm so awesome , you could have just asked . <3 \ 
Love , < PROPFEMALE > . 
Eff being all mushy and sappy for < PROPFIRST>'s Day man . I've got the best < PROPFIRST > s EVER . <3 Can't touch this . 
PAINT IT , WHITE IS AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD ? YESSSS ! 
So we had a three hour discussion on guns in my forensics class and all I could think about was how excited < PROPMALE > Blumenberg and < PROPFIRST > Roach would have been . Yes < PROPFIRST > , he did have a Deagle and yes , it was beautiful . 
Up until now , I've never had a bad chemistry teacher and I always wondered why people hated it so much . \You'll understand soon enough . \ " They said . \ 
Pulled out a random CD in my car and \With A Little Help From My Friends\ " came on . Just a great way to finish off an amazing weekend with the people that make everything I do worth it . <3 Love and miss you guys already ! " 
Swing dancing is hard to choreograph when you don't have a partner . :/ 
First few pins are in the < PROPFEMALE > jacket . I'll be sewing tomorrow . * crosses fingers * If I end up not completely failing at life , I'll get most of the frame of it done tomorrow afternoon . \ 
GAIZ , I CAN BE REAL COSPLAYER NAO ? =DDDD 
So yeeeeah , about that whole sewing thing ? Guess who doesn't have bobbins or even matching thread ? THIS GAL . So Halle , Brit , I guess we're just duel wielding sewing machines next time we meet up . 
I MAY just have to get < PROPFEMALE > Vs . Capcom 3 now . I've been reading up on Amaterasu's involvement and it looks like Capcom did their homework . Plus , there's a dance-remix of \The Sun Rises\ " so ... ya know . " 
I have this absolutely agonizing craving for chocolate right now . >.> 
UCF peeps : apparently we're getting a crepe and gelato shop in Wackadoo's . I . Am . SO . Excited . 
So I guess I'm heading to Swing Knights tonight if anyone decides they want to join me . xD I have NO idea what to expect but it could be fun .... 
So swing ? Lots and LOTS of fun . <333 I wish I could do what some of the people there were doing , but at least now I feel like I have a bit more of a grip on the style . WE'RE GONNA DO THIS DANCE HALLE . IT WILL BE MORE AWESOME THAN PRUSSIA . 
Tomorrow . You know what tomorrow is going to be ? Tomorrow is a coffee shop day . I'm going to check out this little one that sells boba tea because I'm desperately craving a milk tea right now . <3 
My bestie is officially going to be interning at a gorgeous hotel about 40 minutes away from where I am currently sitting . And that's if you drive the actual speed limits , haha . I'm grinning/flailing/yelling like an all-too-proud soccer mom but I don't really care . \ 
This is like the greatest birthday week EVER . Midterms and all . <3 CONGRATS HALLE , YOU TOTALLY DESERVE IT . 
It's approximately 8:45 in the morning , I have a huge forensics exam tonight , a lab today , three homework assignments , classes all day , it's my birthday and I'm wearing sunglasses . Hit it . \ 
Or as < PROPFIRST > O'Donnell would say , \LET'S DO THIS BIRDS ! \"" 
So that forensics essay I had to write ? I shouldn't have even worried . I spent half of the paper shamelessly bashing CSI and I worked in a reference to The Who . So yeah . Pretty pleased with how that went . xD 
I may still have a backlog of math work to do , but with this last assignment , I am finally free to start my Spring Break ! And how will I ring in this joyous occasion ? Why , by playing Okami until dinnertime and/or swing of course ! XD 
So only a few hours of work and the first piece that I have ever ENTIRELY sewn ( besides my balaclava ) is three pieces away from being done . I won't lie , I'm incredibly excited . <3 < PROPFEMALE > jacket will probably be done before the end of spring break ~ ! \ 
I also got to spend most of the day with Halle watching Death Note so ... ya know . Nostalgia and fun times . <3 
CAN SLEEVES JUST GO DIE IN A HOLE ? SERIOUSLY ? I've had to redo the damn things THREE TIMES without any sign of success . >.> 
So uh , there's apparently a Chrono Crusade NOVEL out in Japan . WHAT . \ 
And no one has translated it yet ?! IT CAME OUT IN 2004 ! T.T 
So this is why I'm glad Facebook exists . I hadn't heard about the quake/tsunami until I saw posts on here about it . Thoughts and prayers for all of the people affected by this disaster , guys . I've already heard about a few countries gearing up to send aid over . 
I'm SO sick and tired of people and their ill-informed \humor\ " about people who are different than they are . Seriously . Grow the heck up and don't look down on me because of something I like . :/ " 
My week can't decide if it wants to be amazing or awful . 
Sewing lesson in the costume lab . Can't fit the piece I'm working on in a bag without crumpling it . Have to walk halfway across campus carrying a giant blue monstrosity while dodging the stares . \ 
...... \ 
Challenge accepted . 
So the more I play Okamiden , the more I feel like I'm just playing it because I miss the first one . XD 
Today : Franken < PROPFIRST > arrives . \ 
Tomorrow : Halle Friedman arrives . \ 
The rest of the weekend : One massive puppypile/movie watching/cosplay working love fest . \ 
Oh yeah . I'm SO glad that I'm done with all of my homework because NOTHING productive is getting done . xD 
The best thing about doubt , the best thing about sadness , the best thing about pain .... is that when you finally get over it , it's easy to remember how much you really do love the world . <3 
There's no better wake-up call than a little bit of < PROPFIRST > in the morning . <3 
Alright . I just stood in front of the mirror and said it . < PROPFEMALE > is done . I'm pretty much vaguely packed . I can say I'm ready for Megacon . BRING IT ! 
I have discovered one way to pass the time till Megacon .... \ 
..... Gee gee gee gee baby baby .... 
So day of Megacon , I'm already worried enough as it is about my jacket because I hope it looks decent and what does my Tumblr do ? It floods my feeds with these ridiculously good cosplayers . < PROPFEMALE > COSPLAYERS . Thanks Tumblr . I owe ya one . >.> 
Just got done spending entirely too short of a time with people who are precious to me . Thank you guys for a wonderful weekend . P.S. I miss my BTT already . 
Post-con blues have set in with a vengeance . I'm glad Halle and I have a list of one-shot drabbles to write ; I need some kind of outlet . XP 
UCF peeps , I've got a question for you : I got the email about the severe weather storm , but nothing about what should happen if you've got a class now/later tonight . Anyone heard anything on that ? 
Wait , wait , so I have to walk to class in rain , thunder AND lightning ? \ 
Screw you UCF . Screw you . 
The best place to spend April Fool's Day ? On Capitalia , f5ing the shit out of Kitayume . I love life right now guys . *_* 
So my vote for the big players this year in Eurovision ? Italy and Germany . < PROPFEMALE > won last year , yes , but this song is just ... unnnf . And Italy's song makes me so happy . *_* 
Guys . I am SO bored today . I need some ideas . Anyone have any ideas for some artsy craft things I can work on ? 
It's one of /those/ moods again . I always know it's here because I can't find a song to believe in . I really wish things would stop being so heavy so I can go back to remembering what I'm supposed to be doing here . 
Guys , Gakuen Hetalia's opening and ending themes are out and they are SO BLOODY ADORABLE . <3 
If you're upset and lost , don't worry about breaking my heart . Just hurry , hurry and give some pain to me . We can divide it up all even and surround it all with love . And that's how we'll get by : on love and love alone . <3 
So yeah . Black Butler . I kinda sorta dig it . <3 And I'm even starting to like Ciel , which is saying something because he was really annoying at first . But he's a manipulative little brat he is , and the interaction between him and < PROPMALE > is just wonderful . 
What kind of chemistry lab class makes you write a paper instead of a lab report ? I TESTED OUT OF ENGLISH GUYS AND EVEN THOUGH I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT , I DON'T WANT TO BE WRITING A PAPER ON CHEMISTRY . 
I forgot how stimulating game soundtracks are and how much harder they make me work . *_* Thank you Shadow of the Colossus and Okami for having amazing music . 
Back in OP for the weekend . Forgot how laggy the internet here is . xD 
I haven't been able to write recently . The solution ? Went to research some stuff on the < PROPMALE > occupation of < PROPFEMALE > . Eventually found out that during the reign of < PROPMALE > in < PROPFEMALE > , Prussia was badly beaten back and effectively became a French satellite state . \ 
I may be able to write something now . 
This week is absolutely going to suck . Thankfully I've got the greatest friends ever . When this horrid week is over , when four finals are complete , I will be able to relax with my BTT and the new Okami artbook that my UCF peeps were kind enough to get me . <3 I'm so blessed ! 
Alright math and psych finals , you and I are going to have a long , not-so-friendly talk ...... 
Don't you hate it when you go in , take a final , really don't have any particular difficulty with it , get up to go and realize that all of the smart people are STILL WORKING ON THEIR TESTS ? Yeah , me too . XD 
The best nights ? The best nights are when I stay up until two in the morning talking about absolutely everything and absolutely nothing with the people I love . <3 
\I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean . Whenever one door closes 
One more final to go . Currently studying to the song , \Falling In Love At A Coffee Shop . \ " I'm insanely jealous of you people who are done with finals ; this makes me wanna go to Natura or something to get a milk tea . " 
I'm .... wow . God , wow , I'm done with my first year of college . When the heck did that happen ? 
BTT weekend ? A success beyond anything I could have possibly hoped for . First day of work ? Pretty awesome . I even got to wait my own table ! Back into work at 10:30 tomorrow , but maybe I'll earn more than a 5 dollar tip this time . <3 
Back home for like ... two hours . Then I'm going back into work again . And I'm already feeling so scatterbrained and unsure about everything . I don't know how I'll handle the dinner crowd . I guess we'll see .
