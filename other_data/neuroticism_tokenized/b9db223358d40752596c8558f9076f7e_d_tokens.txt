loves the rain . 

I guess I should start part 2 of RAAMatting my car . When I finish my car will dampen outside noises better than a Lexus and take my speakers to the next level in sound quality . 
Supercharger or Turbocharger ? Big price and Horsepower difference . 
INTERWEBNETS AND CABLE TELEVISION !!!!! I can live again !

Just got out of seeing Iron Man 2 . All encompassingly awesome and I never saw the first one . Hint to all , wait for the credits to end . 
Was that a gunshot ?!? 
Going to Berlin tonight for dancing and Pandora Boxx . Any and all are welcome to come . 
Starve a cold and feed a fever ? I think they should both take care of themselves with a murder-suicide . Apparently the human body was not meant to have so many late nights . 
How does one go about planning their own birthday party when they are always making sure everyone else can have a good time ? I keep second guessing myself on what to do . 
At Argosy university getting information for graduate school . Anyone have first hand knowledge of the quality ? 
Love is a snowmobile racing across the tundra and then suddenly it flips over , pinning you underneath . At night , the ice weasels come . - < PROPMALE > Groening 
Casualty last night . Wiimote got soaked in beer . Woke up to it vibrating on its own ( system was not on ) on the coffee table . Pulled the batteries and put them back in and all four lights stay on dimly and it wont turn on the system . I will have to try cleaning it with isopropyl before pronouncing it dead . 
Loves this weather . If I wasn't working I would still do a cookout . Rain on a sunroof is so relaxing . 
Pomegranate vodka sno-cones and Super < PROPFIRST > Kart . Hell yea a good night . 
How does a lugnut take 3 months to fall off on it's own while the other 4 are tight as usual ? I think I've been robbed . Now to buy one lugnut from Toyota . 
Happy birthday to me ! Thank you to < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFIRST > coming out with us to make it a great day . Hehe .

< PROPFEMALE > left her phone at home . I took it to her at work . When I got there I still tried texting her that I was there while holding her phone in my other hand . 
Going to need some < PROPFEMALE > Winehouse for the drive home . The great thing about mp3 is that you don't have to see the artist . 
Life's interesting when we get moments of clarity and understanding . Things that were big deals are no longer and situations become allow for greater growth . It also stops one's eye twitching from stress . 
Is still cleaning up shards of glass off of the ground . That's now 5 glasses , 3 bottles , 2 plates , and 1 blender since we moved in . 
I have to make a choice between three things and they all are negative in some way . 
Loves thunderstorms . 
Apt is now full with 3 dead computers and 2 dead laptops . If I didn't have my Droid we'd be in trouble . 
Stuck at the store until at least midnight as they strip and rewax the floor . Joyful Sunday night . 
Good news , my computer is back up and running . Just needed to pull the CMOS battery and do a little case dusting . 
At least I only had to be at work for 4.5 hours on my day off . 
< PROPFEMALE > is performing at the MusicBox in < PROPMALE > Horror Picture Show . Come and see a show and stay for the fun ! 
What an interesting night . < PROPFEMALE > was in < PROPMALE > so I went to kill an hour at the Blue Bayou across the street from the musicbox . For some reason I got a free shot , heineken , and < PROPFEMALE > car bomb . This was after 2 beers at < PROPFEMALE>'s during Apples to Apples . 
Synthpop has seized my ears lately ! 
Geja's Cafe by < PROPMALE > Park Zoo has phenomenal fondue . Check it out but make sure its a special occasion . It is very romantic .

Palos car show . Yes ! 
Off to WestFest and Vigilante Press for movie night .

Market Days or Black Women Expo ? Tough choice . 
Spin ! 
The jail was rained out but now we are going to watch expletive ridden Blues Brothers in a church drinking liquor and beer . 
It is official . My last day at PETCO will be the 26th and I will start at FedEx Office on the 27th . 
White Catholics are so boring . They have \eternal life\ " and practice cannibalism and yet can't even celebrate above a dull hallelujah . " 
\Brick walls are there for a reason . They give us a < PROPMALE > to show how badly we want something . \ " - < PROPFIRST > Pausch "

Sox game with my boys ( wife included for baseball) ! 
Awesome time at the Sox game . They may have lost but we had a great time . Especially when < PROPMALE > walked dead on into pole . 
Day one of FedEx Office complete . I have a ton to learn but it will be fun . 
Just finished helping < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > move into their new apartment . Now for < PROPFEMALE>'s family reunion followed by < PROPMALE > Horror in Willmette .

Building a roof . I love weekends off !

It's nice to have my 360 back with a free month of Xbox Live attached . 
Spin tonight to see and meet Pandora Boxx ! < PROPFEMALE > is so excited . Call us if you want to meet up there . Cover is only $5 . 
Home made from scratch pineapple upside down cake ! < PROPFEMALE > sure can bake up deliciousness so effortlessly . 
The Buried Life is absolutely amazing . Just watched the few episodes I missed before season 2 starts . I highly recommend it . 
Learning how to package goods at FedEx Office :\ 
Step 1 : Assess package . \ 
Step 2 : Get a box . \ 
Step 3 : Cut a hole in the box . \ 
Step 4 : Put your junk in the box . \ 
Step 5 : Speak to Human Resources about improper packing ... 
see < PROPFEMALE > Swiech-Macejak in < PROPMALE > tonight at the Musicbox Theatre ! Show starts at midnight . I will take me usual preshow drinks at the Blue Bayou across the street .

No one should complain about double Downs or Baconwiches . The British have Blood Pudding . That trumps all in disgusting food . 
Third time in Atlanta and all I have ever seen is the airport . 
Whelp , a Saturday night on my own while < PROPFEMALE > is at Wilmette for < PROPMALE > . What the heck am I to do ? 
Carving pumpkins with the always beautiful < PROPFEMALE > Swiech-Macejak and watching \It's the Great Pumpkin < PROPFIRST > Brown \"." 
Halloween parade in Boystown followed by SPIN ! 
Pre shirt T-shirt time ! 
Hamburger < PROPFIRST>'s has some great food . Now to < PROPMALE>'s for some dance dance ! 
The Internet is like alcohol in some sense . It accentuates what you would do anyway . If you want to be a loner , you can be more alone . If you want to connect , it makes it easier to connect . - < PROPFEMALE > Dyson 
I love eating healthy . Two eggs with cheese broccoli and Chorizo with a glass of water . Fulfilling and very tasty . 
So , I am sure I will get flak for this but I might as well say it . I like Jersey Shore because it inspires me to be a healthier person . Whenever I watch it I want to punch Snooki in the face and then go work out . They may be douchebags but the guys party , used to have full time jobs , and still ate healthy , dressed nice , and made time to stay fit . 
Whelp , it is time for me to take the GRE . I hope I have done enough studying . The hardest part for me was remembering that the test has Algebra problems and not Calculus . Nothing like overthinking a problem for 10 minutes then going , oh ... right . \ 
\ 
Well that and vocabulary . If only I was an Engineer . 
My GRE Scores :\ 
Verbal : 520\ 
Quantitative : 650\ 
Written : TBD\ 
Total is 1170 out of 1600 . Given that I studied for only 6 hours over 2 days , I guess that is good . If I can squeak out another 130 points The Chicago School will give me $ 10,000 a year . 
I finally watched Cannonball Run . It was ridiculous . Funny and all since it is a cast of so many A-listers though I would have liked it more if it was a serious movie . I really want to take part in the real Cannonball run . 
A magician pulls rabbits out of hats . An experimental psychologist pulls habits out of rats . 
Four Loko , Hypnotiq , and BattleShots ( shots , shots , shots , shots ) . This is the kind of < PROPMALE > Potter party I can get behind . 
Ate at Buca di Beppos for the first time yesterday . Even as leftovers it is still fantastic . It has been too long since I've had good Italian food . 
I am officially applied to the Chicago School and the only thing left is for those letters of recommendation . 
Japanese beef and Tofu Hot Pot . I love cooking healthy and flavourful food . 
I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it . \ 
Sex in the air , I don't care , I love the smell of it . \ 
Sticks and stones may break my bones\ 
but chains and whips excite me . 
Waiting for < PROPMALE > Potter IMAX . This should certainly be a good one . 
Cheers to the freakin ' weekend ; I drink to that . \ 
Oh let the Jameson sink in ; I drink to that . \ 
Don't let the bastards get you down and turn it around with another round . \ 
There's a party at the bar . \ 
Everybody put your glasses up and I drink to that . 
Woodfield Mall for some 3-story shopping goodness . 
Has just coined a new term . Douchebaguette : the female equivalent of the Douchebag . 
I love these rainy days . The feel , temperature and smell . It's nature washing itself off to let us see the beauty . 
I wonder what would happen if all internal monologues went on strike for a week . Would the world be quieter or louder ? Would people take more chances or less ? Would people not jump to judgment or be more fearful without it ? This moment of thought brought to you by Jeph Jacgues and his guest comic for XKCD . 
TG1 at the parents completed . TG2 at the in-laws completed . TG3 at home with < PROPMALE > , Diet 7up cake and horror movies in progress . 
Getting ready for Freakeasy at The Metro . Looking good , feeling good and ready to dance the night away with the sexy < PROPFEMALE > Swiech-Macejak . 
Pre-shirt T-shirt time should only happen when the T-shirt is part of the final wardrobe . Otherwise it's just redundant . 
Get him to the Greek was a fantastic and hilarious movie . It is so quotable . 
Buried Life one hour season finale ! 
Since when was MTV ever a network with TV shows that make me cry ? And not from disgust either ( I'm looking at you Real World ) . The Buried Life is so great . 
I came up in here to rock . \ 
Light a fire , make it hot . \ 
I don't wanna take no pictures . \ 
I just wanna take some shots . 
It may be during the week but at least I always get 2 days off in a row . Time to get stuff done . 
It's inspiring to drive by Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Alsip to see the rows and rows of police cars there to pay respect to their fallen brother . 
\What you got a dollar in yo ' pocket ? A twenty in yo ' wallet ? \ 
The Walking Dead season finale ! Just one of too many good shows on . 
OH NOOOOO ! Child abuse just started again from everyone changing their profile pictures back to real people ! Oh the huge manitee ! 
\I like a girl that's thick off cabbage . I like a girl that grinds on a mattress . \ 
At the Laundrette . I think comforters were the creation of laundromats everywhere in conjunction with the washing machine industry since only commercial washers can fit these beastly sheets on steriods . 
\We don't see things as they are 
Celebrating Chrysoula's bday at the Brazen Head . 
Chocolate Martinis with peppermint rim and home cooked food ? Now this is a work holiday party . 
Only another 30 minutes before tamale day ends as a success ! Nothing like making 8 batches totaling over 200 of beef , chicken and vegetable kinds . That only took 9 hours but they are TASTY ! 
Waiting for the fish to bite or waiting for wind to fly a kite . Or waiting around for Friday night or waiting perhaps for their Uncle < PROPMALE > or a pot to boil or a better break or a string of pearls or a pair of pants or a wig with curls or another < PROPMALE > . Everyone is just waiting . ~ Dr. Seuss 
Nothing like crying in your car before work for feeling like you let everyone down . Happy weekend . 
Life is not lost by dying ; life is lost minute by minute , day by dragging day , in all the thousand small uncaring ways . ~ Stephen < PROPMALE > Benét 
< PROPFIRST > Adams Chocolate Bock is a pretty good . Now the first round of X-Files drinking game with < PROPFEMALE > Swiech-Macejak and Xindy Rock will be pleasant . Then it's on to Warsteiner . < PROPMALE > Di Zenzo this better be some good < PROPMALE > beer . 
The Expendables ! Ready for some manly action ... wait not that kind . ( I'm looking at you < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > -.-) 
We're fools whether we dance or not , so we might as well dance . ~ Japanese Proverb 
Don't ever save anything for a special occasion . Being alive is the special occasion . ~ Author Unknown 
Brother and sister-in-law are visiting from Ohio . Nice holiday family gathering on a chilly night . 
Lunar eclipse tonight from midnight until 5 am . What a great event to happen on the Winter Solstice . 
Day 2 with my brother , sister-in-law and nephew before they leave for Ohio . Nice to see my sister , brother-in-law and other nephew too . They are not as far away 
Don't be fooled by the calendar . There are only as many days in the year as you make use of . ~ Charles Richards 
Had some very tasty meat pies cooked by < PROPFEMALE > . Now just need Abuelita hot chocolate and a good movie to finish out the Solstice . 
I love Half price books . Picking up GQ and Esquire for $2 sure beats even subscription price . 
It's not a question of happiness , really , or it's pursuit . It's a question of deciding the kind of person that you want to be . Weak or strong . Furtive or Steadfast . Happiness is never the object . It's just an incidental side effect that comes with living bravely , and well . ~ Oliver Broudy ( Men's Health Magazine ) 
The mall parking lot is completely full . I just want my Buffalo Wild Wings . Cursed last second shoppers . 
I love playing with my sister's chinchillas . They are sooo FLUFFY . 
Circle of Death is always a great game to play . Learned more rules again . I love how everyone has different rules for it . 
Also , The League is a pretty awesome show . 
If you wait , all that happens is that you get older . ~ Larry McMurtry ( Some Can Whistle ) 
You don't get to choose how you're going to die . Or when . You can only decide how you're going to live . Now . ~ Joan Baez 
Hold up . Wait a minute . Let me put some Kush up in it . 
Feeling so fly like a Cheese Stick . 
Love me some Belvedere martini at < PROPMALE > Place . Now time for the Social Network . 
The Social Network was a fantastic movie . Makes me want to watch Pirates of Silicon Valley again . 
I call this club Titanic . Why ? Because it's going down ! 
\Style\ " is an expression of individualism mixed with charisma . Fashion is something that comes after style . ~ < PROPFIRST > Fairchild " 
< PROPMALE > Light and Blow ... the movie ! Hanging with an old friend for new years < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > . 
When one has a great deal to put into it , a day has a hundred pockets . ~ Friedrich Nietzsche ( Human , All Too Human ) 
Our server room always sounds like someone has the microwave on across the hall . 
Going bowling for the first time in a long time . Since my birthday actually . 
I still have it . 181 , 265 ( clean game with 8 strikes ) and 192 . I guess I should go by Mr. < PROPFEMALE > more often . 
Daydreams may be pleasant , but accomplishments are more satisfying . 
I like my beats fast and my bass down low . 
Oh how I miss having XM Radio in my car . I really need to expand my listening library to other genres . 
I wonder if it means anything that in Grand Theft Auto 4 : The Ballad of Gay < PROPFIRST > , I spend more time doing the mini game of being a Floor Manager in one of the dance clubs then doing anything else in the game . 
Gameworks was great . I am the claw game master . I won an Eeyore and a Pooh Bear with one play . Though DDR has reminded me that I need to run regularly . 
I have always liked acoustic versions of songs but I am really liking piano/violin/orchestral covers of popular music . You never realize how much depth to the music there is until someone can make fantastic arrangements to it . I just listened to Amazing by Kanye West played on a piano and Bohemian Rhapsody by < PROPFEMALE > on 4 violins and am inspired . 
At < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , and < PROPFEMALE>'s for < PROPFEMALE>'s birthday shenanigans ! Hey Farva , what's that restaurant you like with all the crap on the walls ? 
You will never find time for anything . If you want time you must make it . ~ Charles Buxton 
I can't wait for Wednesday . My favorite day of the week since it's basically the first day of my weekend and I can do things that are fun and productive . 
In < PROPMALE>'s Speech , < PROPMALE > Dumbledore V dies on minute 32 ! Excellent movie and < PROPMALE > Firth is going to be one of the great actors of this generation . 
Nothing like waiting around for an email to find out what time I need to be on a conference call today , my day off , all about organizational changes throughout the company . 
How funny that now that I have The Social Network soundtrack i recognize many of the songs from the movie . This after saying that I don't remember any of the music . This is exactly what makes an excellent movie when everything just fits together so perfectly . 
About to change my oil to some < PROPMALE > Purple 5w-20 Synthetic . Afterwards I'm considering going to the gun range . 
After all this talk about the zodiac signs being different ( which anyone who has taken an astronomy class would already have known ) I decided to look up my \old\ " and \ " new\ " signs . They were both vague enough to be true just as I remembered all horoscopes to be . Astrology is just another faith based religion created to explain things that people didn't ( and really never will ) understand how or why . " 
Golf is so popular simply because it is the best game in the world at which to be bad . ~ A.A. Milne 
The kisses of the sun , Were sweet I didn't blink\ 
I let it in my eyes , Like an exotic drink\ 
The radio playing songs , That I have never heard\ 
I don't know what to say , Oh not another word 
Would it be too much to wear a bullet proof vest as a fashion item ? I'm not talking about the bulky kind that military and police officers wear . There are some pretty sleek looking ones that still offer stab and bullet ( up to a . 44magnum ) protection . 
Party for the sake of good friends ! Lots of liquor , pizza , drinking games and cigars . Going to be a good night . 
But now I know that our world is no more permanent than a wave rising in the ocean . Whatever our struggles and triumphs , however we may suffer them , all too soon they bleed into a wash , just like watery ink on paper . ~ Memoirs of a Geisha 
In the bath tub at 6 AM . Nothing like a fever to wake me from sleep . At least now I know it wasn't a hangover from Saturday now . 
Turkey and Chorizo burger with BBQ sauce , lettuce , tomato , and onion for lunch . That was a delicious burger and great texture . 
RoboGeisha and Creationary at < PROPFEMALE > &<PROPFIRST>'s . Hell yes ! 
Going to < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Pub and meeting up with . < PROPMALE > Di Zenzo 
Que dozens of updates related to football . 
Homemade turkey and chorizo chili is just as fantastic as leftovers . I think I will just keep these 2 main ingredients for anything that calls for ground beef . 
After being clean for over a year , I sure hope < PROPFEMALE > Winehouse comes out with a new album soon and starts touring . There are not many contemporary artists who can pull off classic soul and blues . 
$1 drinks night at Spin ! Who is in ? 
Time to catch up on my guilty pleasure of Jersey Shore . 
Going to spend some quality time with my car today . She needs a good interior cleaning to restore that new car smell . 
Thank you Pandora for letting me know of < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > Spektor among other fine artists . At least now I know that Pandora sucks for rap artists but great for < PROPFEMALE > Winehouse . 
I need to go back to having hard liquor when I go out . Beer has consistently given me a slight hangover feeling the next day even if its just a couple bottles . On the plus side last night was the first time in years that my brother and I have < PROPMALE > out together without other family . 
< PROPMALE > rabbit just ate a skittle off of < PROPFEMALE>'s tongue . Weirdo . 
Sure looks like FedEx Office will be closing early tonight and may even be closed tomorrow . If our DM doesn't close us then I get to open since I am the closest to the store . It may be my day off but I will either get overtime or a weekend day off . 
FedEx Office is closing early tonight . All FedEx shipments are grounded due to O'Hare being shut down . It looks as if they will stay closed tomorrow as well . Now for a nice night in with < PROPFEMALE > Swiech-Macejak , video games , movies , and wine . 
Waiting around for a call on whether we are opening today . The 3 foot snow drifts say no but who knows . 
My entire district for FedEx Office is officially closed today . I still get paid for today and get Friday off too . Hell yes . 
Hey < PROPMALE > , we're gonna kill ya . Ooopah ! ... there you go . 
< PROPFEMALE > pizza , bruschetta , mimosas , < PROPMALE > Ramsay's Best Kitchen , and the new SVU . This is how to spend a snow night . 
Time for my guilty pleasure . You have to stay fresh to death . 
Heavy air with heavier words that sink into the stomach . No one can fly free with all the weight and will fall off the runway into abyss . 
Suited up and heading to < PROPFIRST>'s Saturday Bonanza downtown . 
This is awesome , old friend , new friends , $15 open bar and UFC 126 on 14 flat screens in the bar . I really need to get back into kick boxing . 
Nothing like a choke out on UFC and one half of your wifes wedding ring being lost on the floor from a tipsy friend . Then the entire bar cheers after finding it 
< PROPFEMALE > just knocked Belfort the fuck out with a Hell of a kick . 
Just had 8 people in my 5 seated 2 door to get to the lions head . First for everything . 
The more things change , the more they stay the same ..... 
Disappointed that I didn't get a picture of myself wearing my new suit ( first time ) looking worthy of being in an advertisement in GQ . Though the bar was packed too tight to even try taking any pictures and my Moto Droid sucks at taking pictures anyway . 
I sure hope this head cold leaves soon . I have had only about 6 hours of sleep over the last three nights combined . I also had to open the Mokena location this morning which means I am by myself for 5 hours and they do not have a radio that I can plug my iPod into . Pandora and YouTube all day it is then . 
The National Anthem always manages to give me shivers ... even when < PROPFEMALE > Aguilera fumbles some of the wording . Beyonce's 2004 Super Bowl rendition was a great pallet cleanser and even made my eyes a little watery too . 
So happy to rest after an 11 hour work day . I can either have a short day or take overtime . I'll go with the money . 
Glee currently holds 7 of the top 10 downloads on iTunes . The show at least is introducing new and classic music to an audience that may never have been introduced to it before . I mean , Firework is higher than < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST>'s version , Bills , Bills , Bills from < PROPFEMALE>'s Child ala 1999 , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE>'s Thriller , and just to even things out Fat Bottom Girls by < PROPFEMALE > . 
The good news about losing weight is looking better in fitted clothing . The bad thing is having to keep buying new clothes and having nice clothes be too big . 
Fuck this night . Fuck it to all fucking Hell . Fucking bullshit of a razor cock ass reeming night . FUCK ! 
There is something so calming about hearing just wind and the tires on the road at 100mph . Follow it up with a ride through a < PROPMALE > and the night isn't too bad 
I really need to get a job that is Monday thru Friday . I want to do manly ( and many ) things on the weekend like build furniture , work on my car , play baseball , hit the golf course , and of course sleep in for once on a Sunday after a hell of a Saturday out . 
Disaster is beautiful . 
Just tried locking the apartment door by pushing the lock button on my car key . Must be anticipation for the AutoShow tomorrow . 
Heading to the Chicago AutoShow with < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > Miller . Nothing like cars to clear your mind . 
Will be a strange day working on a Thursday . Good thing is that I'm off tomorrow because of it . 
My computer is now rocking 2.7 Terabytes of storage . Now begins the process of ripping all of my movies to it . 
I must have the painting that is hanging on the wall . It is a Grand Piano engulfed in flames . 
I love listening to the rain . 
At the Bloomingdale location today and Friday for training . I like getting paid for mileage . 
What we think , or what we know , or what we believe is , in the end , of little consequence . The only consequence is what we do . - < PROPFIRST > Ruskin 
Found a very stylish titanium and < PROPFEMALE > bracelet for my self at < PROPFEMALE > Jewellers . It matches my Citizen titanium watch and ring for only $650 on sale from $1300 . 
Just witnessed a charging bro-hug . Where's < PROPMALE > when you need him ? 
It's a Bro-pocalypse ! 
Life should be lived as a Waltz , not as a Cha-Cha . 
Sometimes I catch myself looking absolutely fantastic and wonder why no one has made a statue of me yet . 
Fast and Furious turned out to be a really good movie . Now I'm even more excited for Fast Five . 
I am amazed that after so many things went wrong that it led perfectly to having a great night . I never would have thought getting 2 flat tires could be good . 
I know a lot of people ( women ) love < PROPFIRST > Franco but he is not really all that charming or suave . He was completely upstaged by < PROPFEMALE > Hathaway . 
Only love can break your heart . 
Courage is doing what you're afraid to do . There can be no courage unless you're scared . - < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Rickenbacker\ 
Courage is not the absence of fear , but rather the judgment that something else is more important than fear . - < PROPMALE > Redmoon 
Deciding if I should pull two 14 hour days to make 14 hours of overtime . Decisions , decisions . 
Today and tomorrow I am working 8am until Midnight . It will be long and arduous but I just need a Rockstar or two and to keep the dollar $igns in my mind . 
Getting my wisdom teeth out tomorrow . At least I have a ton of Netflix to watch . 
On my way to have my wisdom teeth taken out . I feel naked without my watch and rings on . 
I am a SuperBeast . The day after my wisdom teeth come out I feel fine with no pain and slight swelling . 
Jury summons . I wonder if it will be as boring as the last time where I sat around not getting called for 8 hours . 
I wonder if it would be a good idea to have a Vicoden fueled one man dance party at work for the last two hours we are open since no one will be here using any services . 
< PROPFEMALE > Autumn was a fun concert . There was a plethora of corsets . Amazing to see how emotional people got from the music . Wish I could sleep for a day though . 
The cucumber in the water does make it even more refreshing ! The Other Guys was so right . 
Stitches out and teeth are healing great . However , ran yesterday for the first time of the new year and hamstrings hate me today . 
Its so nice outside , too bad I work late tonight . At least I can write up a business plan and get some things moving . 
Three good things about closing on friday : B96 Street Mix , Dance Factory Radio , or KissFM Dance Mix on the drive home . 
Rolling thunderstorms are awesome . 
At a Tiki bar getting tipsy and telling drunk stories and having in depth gender differences debate . What a wonderful night and happy birthday < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Starting to really want a motorcycle . I will get it this year . 
Just watched a movie called Fat Head . It was a documentary like Super Size Me where he ate Fast Food for every day for one month . He lost weight and showed how the government pushed agriculture . Very cool to get the other side of the story . People need to do their own research and never take any one expert or documentary as the only \right\ " answer . " 
I think I need to pick up an HTC Thunderbolt soon . My Droid is just slugging around now and who can resist Verizon's 4G LTE high speed network ? 
Although the world is full of suffering , it is also full of the overcoming of it . \ –Helen Keller " 
I hope I'm not needed for jury duty tomorrow . Also , I live 3 minutes from the Bridgeview Courthouse yet I get summoned into the city both times . 
Good news , I'm not called for Jury Duty . Free friday for me . 
\Tears are words that the heart can't express . \ " – Unknown Via Too Write Love on Her Arms " 
Rihanna is coming to Chicago on June 15th with Cee-lo Green . 
Day one ( of hopefully only 2 weeks ) working at the Matteson location and I have already managed to set off the panic alarm while trying to arm for the night . It's not my fault that no one told me it doesn't arm the same as my regular store . Good to know that the cops take over 20 minutes to show up here though ... 
Dance my headache away Dance Factory radio . Two more nights closing before I'm off Friday and Saturday . 
\My secrets out . My junk is in . I don't even know who I am anymore ! \ " - < PROPMALE > from Perfect Couples " 
I think its about time to get myself a tattoo . Not THE tattoo but one to keep me going . I have half a concept right now . 
Woodfield Mall is a blaze with people . What recession ? 
I would have a new jacket if H&M new that men's clothing is suppose to have the zipper on the right side . Probably why they were on clearance though . 
The Other Guys is ridiculous and random and completely awesome ! I'm a peacock , you have to let me fly ! 
I hope to get back to my own store soon . As it is I wake up at 1pm , work 3-11 , then get to bed at 4 am . No productivity at all . 
About to give the first wash and wax of the year for my baby . Can't wait to see her shine . 
Downside to washing your own car is seeing all the new battle scars alongside the old ones that still need fixing . 
Hard liquor , hard house music and hard bodies . Happy birthday < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Note to self : be awesome . 
Flashed my Droid to CyanogenMod 7 . I now have Android 2.3 ( gingerbread ) and some really cool features . Added a new kernel ( Chevyno1 Ultra Low Voltage ) and I am overclocked to 1GHz with better battery life as well . I love modding everything . 
Finally sold my 1973 Super Beetle ! I wish I could still work on it but now I can get a motorcycle and pay some bills . 
Love the rain . I can't wait to hit the road in a little bit . Nothing like driving in the rain solitary , listening to the rain hit the glass ( my car has an all glass roof ) and letting my iPod play on shuffle with new songs . Sometimes the best moments are so simple to have . 
Managers meeting in Merrilleville , IN . Its going halfway back to Purdue . Like Spongebob flipping crabby patties ; I go to work . 
< PROPFIRST>'s Chicken must use chickens from the farm in Narnia or Neverland . Sooooi delicious even the second time . 
Fast Five comes out this Friday the 29th . Who wants to go see it with me ? So much awesome action and ridiculousness per the usual . 
Girl the way you movin ' got me in a trance\ 
Dj turn me up ladies this yo jam ( Come on)\ 
Imma sip mascato and you gon ' loose them pants\ 
And Imma throw this money while you do it with no hands 
Epic weekend is epic . Now with more epic ! 
Dave : She is letting herself go . \ 
Rex : How bad is it ? Does she still sleep in her nighttime jewelry ? 
Mobil 1 0w-20 Synthetic engine oil . < PROPMALE > Purple 75w-90 synthetic gear oil ( < PROPMALE > transmission ) . New air filter and cabin filter . My car is loving today .
