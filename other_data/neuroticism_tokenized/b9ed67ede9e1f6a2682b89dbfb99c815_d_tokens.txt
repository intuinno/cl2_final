DEPRESSION is not a sign of weakness it is asign that you have been trying to be strong for too long . Put this as your status if you know someone who has or has had depression . Will you do it & leave it on your status for at least an hour ? Most people won't , but it's mental health week and 1 in 3 of us will suffer at some point in our lives . Show your support good people

Sitting here with < PROPMALE > , going to watch season two of 24 . all I have to say is that it better be as good as the first season , and that I hope that they found a better continuity person . All I am saying is that you saw the camera guy three times and < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > changed outfits throught the season !
