Best 2009 memory ? I don't know , there's a lot . Meeting up with my Lakeland friends again , camping , raider comp ., homecoming , Subway ... Ah . Good times . :D What's your favorite 2009 memory ? 

\Very few humans are eaten by praying mantises . \"" 
Just got back from the mall w/ < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > . Had tons of fun trying on clothes , eating cinnamon pretzels , and attempting to talk to the Italian who looked like my ex-boyfriend . Ricardoooo . XD 
Lalalalala ... Procrastination is fun ! :D 
Road trip , road trip , road trip ! 
In the midst of all the disaster going on around us , people still manage to laugh . Life is good . :) 
Had to get up at 4 in the morning for camp , but it'll totally be worth it . BRB @ camp . :D 
Today would be an amazing day to go boating . Wish I had my boaters license . 
I feel pretty , oh so pretty . :) 
I have blisters on my feet in places that I didn't even know could GET blisters . XD I had fun at homecoming , nonetheless . 
A grand huzzah for not failing Ms. Harmon's class ! :D 
I love that it's a three day job to clean my room because I am easily distracted by shiny objects . Playing with bubbles for twenty minutes ? I think so . 
Over at < PROPFEMALE > Welch's . She just attacked < PROPFEMALE > . 
I just lost the game . :/ 
And we're back to square one . Not necessarily a bad thing , you know . :) 
Then they were out of sight , and , like the saying , out of mind . 
And so ends this wonderful day . Here's to more to come . :) 
Peppermint Lip Gloss : It's beginning to taste a lot like Christmas . 
It's been a good week . :) Best in a while , that's for sure . 
So excited for the Casting Crowns concert tonight . :D 
So I just wanted to say sorry to everyone in my math class . Totally my fault that Mr. < PROPFIRST > decided to give the harder quiz . Um , oops ? 
Best moment of my entire day : Finding out my mom made nachos for dinner . :D 
\Wait ... Weretigers ? \"" 
Heading out to 3rd street . :) 
Results are definite . Opinions may vary . 
I hate it when you look at the clock and it reads 2:14 AM . then you look back what you believe is a moment later and it's 3:28 AM . -_-; Ah , good night . 
\What's your area code ? \ " \ " Depends on what week it is . \ " XD " 
Irregular Spanish preterite . Because regular Spanish preterite isn't hard enough . XP 
I do suppose that my definition of failing is different than most people's , however , I will definitely be failing Ms. Harmon's test tomorrow , by ALL definitions of the word . XP 
Anyone else use Microsoft Messenger ? 
\I JUST WANNA SEND THEM A VIRTUAL PUNCH !!!!!! \ " XD People on the internet are funny . " 
I hate it when a good nap is interrupted . Especially for something like packing . 
Think I could get away with just sleeping through tomorrow ? XP 
\Liquid nitrogen is such a practical ingredient . I wonder why it's not in every American kitchen . \ " Gotta love < PROPMALE > Brown . XD " 
Okay , I've waited this long , I can wait a little longer . :) Thank you and good night . 
Inspiration is easy , following up is hard . 
Just spent 4 hours drawing a pictures using my new gel pens . I could have been catching up on my Spanish homework , but I feel this was a better use of my time . 
The moments of uncertainty make the moments of confidence so much sweeter . 
My mom totally just walked in while I was working on her birthday present , so glad she didn't notice . :) 
Just when I'd stopped hoping . :) 
Just got home . Had fun chilling with < PROPFIRST > outside of Publix . :) 
Expect the best , prepare for the worst . 
Question : Is embogglement a word ? 
And now that the step-cousins are asleep , it's time to play some Majora's Mask ! :D 
Hello , final day of 2009 . 
Chocolate mousse is just fluffy chocolate pudding . But it's DELICIOUS fluffy chocolate pudding . 
Inception with Casi < PROPFEMALE > Bedford and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > at 2 AM ? I think so . 
The fact of the matter is that I'm going crazy , and I want you right there with me on the way there . 
I am so wearing mittens tomorrow . 
Had tons of fun today with < PROPFIRST > Madaffer , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , and < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . :D Glad we got the filming out of the way and can edit on Monday and Friday . Also , To Narnia ! 
Tan . ( Just to bug < PROPFIRST >.) 
And long never really is long enough . 
Sometimes I wonder . Sometimes I don't . :) 
Haha ! I love my abnormal sleeping schedule . Not . 
Me and my accuracy have a love/hate relationship . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > IS DA BOMB . :D 
I can't believe my brother keeps making me lose the game . D: 
Ugh , so badly sunburnt . But whatever , had an awesome day anyone with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > Lamb . Going to eat dinner now . :D 
Hours of preparation for a few brief moments of photographed perfection . 
Got back from my first Gathering . Must say , it was interesting , but definitely fun . :D 
As if I really needed another reason to hate youtube . 
If I said I'm moving on , it'd be true . If I said I was over it , that would probably be the biggest lie I would've ever told . 
WORLD PLEASE KNOW THAT < PROPFEMALE > Welch AND I ARE PARTYING IT UP . After all , it is Friday night . Yay ! :D 
Back from < PROPMALE>'s party . Had a blast climbing trees , laughing at < PROPFIRST > climbing stuff , and watching < PROPFIRST > play chuzzle . XD 
\If I don't date them I can't fall for them . \ " Lies and propaganda . On a < PROPMALE > scale . " 
Muahaha . :D 
I know < PROPMALE>'s the greatest ... 
When did my life get to be a cheesy teen romance novel , eh ? 
Back from the fair . < PROPMALE > out with a ton of people and < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Marston won me a giant cow that I named Edvard and that makes me lose the game ( thanks Bacon < PROPFIRST > ) every time I look at it . :D Awesome job < PROPFEMALE > Campo and < PROPFIRST > Sabb ! 
Happy Hallmark Profit Day ! :D 
:D Woo ! Good weekend . 
I love my mommy and my half priced Valentines day chocolates . :D 
I am suddenly aware of just how disgusting I really am right now . XD 
Today just keeps getting better and better . :D 
A smart person would do their homework now so they won't have to worry about it later . However a clever person knows it'll get done when they get around to it . :P 
You never really realize how creepy facebook is until it comes up in conversation . 
Is there a difference between red-orange and orange-red ? 
So my mom kind of got a job at the Ritz-Carlton and it's kind of the most AWESOME thing ever . :D 
First thing I do upon having internet again , check facebook and google the word \ubiquitous . \"" 
With < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > ! :D We made cookies and I < PROPFIRST > all over her wall . 
Kir Hernandez is my hero . :D Glad I could make your afternoon a little more entertaining . 
Dead tired from the Skillet concert . :D Awesome way to kick of spring break . 
Enjoying some video games on a Sunday night . I love Spring Break in Lakeland . 
My older brother is pretty awesome . Yeah man . 
I had a blast rollerblading with < PROPFIRST > Belliveau today . But I kinda doubt my dad's going to let me leave the house without wearing a helmet ever again . XD 
How is it that when you HAVE to clean , you suddenly have a million other things you also HAVE to do ? 
Don't you LOVE it when you get EXACTLY what you want ? I know I don't . 
It's strange being the first person on campus in the morning . 
* yawn * Today was potentially the best day I'd had in a while . The best part ? I'm not grounded ! :D 
I'm not too sure what to do with myself now that I'm forbidden from rollerblading . XP 
I had way more fun hanging out with < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > Binner , < PROPFIRST > Peterson , < PROPMALE > , and a bunch of the other guys today . Definitely better than working on my research paper or catching up in Ms. Harmon's class . :P 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > - \It's like icing on the cake ... of doom ! \"" 
When planning the weekend , a normal person who's going to see a play might just write \Midsummer's Night Dream @ Southeastern University\ " rather than taking the whole bottom half of the white board to draw stick figures depicting a scene from said play . Just saying . " 
Best . Weekend . Ever . 
So home from Moe's and < PROPFIRST > Peterson's house where I chilled with < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > , Osvald < PROPMALE > , and < PROPFIRST > Ortiz-diaz . But I'm pretty sure that < PROPFIRST > and I must have driven around for , like an hour after leaving . You know , tailing people and plotting to < PROPMALE > Taco Ardiente . Yeah man . :D 
Is it just me , or has this week been rather bland ? 
This week just got significantly better . < PROPFIRST > was right , hanging out with him does spice everything up . :D 
You know , I'm really glad that I stayed to help out with Little Shop today and yesterday . It was a blast . :D 
How does somebody miss dinosaurs in the fridge ? SERIOUSLY , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > . DINOSAURS in the FRIDGE . I am SO disappointed in you . What if they were REAL dinosaurs ? We would all be dead now because you let them out of the fridge without even noticing them . 
\You think cotton < PROPFEMALE > is a fruit ? \""

Loving the playlist title : \Assonance And Archetypal Malarky . \ " Goofing off and studying for the English exam at the same time ! :D " 
Just got home thanks to < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > unlocking the door . And I'd like to thank < PROPFIRST > Kilcoyne for letting me clean his car and play SS: BB for the two hours I was locked out of my house . Woo . :D 
It has occurred to me that my life really isn't that exciting , but I'm able to make it sound like it is . :D 
Which is worse : Brushing your teeth and then drinking orange juice , or drinking chocolate milk and then eating a pickle ? 
< PROPFEMALE > Welch : \Don't ever drink the Country Time ! EVER . \""

KC is the tubing < PROPFEMALE > 
Home from Key Largo . Thanks so much to Casi < PROPFEMALE > Bedford for inviting me and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > for going so my mom would be cool with it . :D I had a blast .

\Good . That's what moms are for . Crushing dreams . \ " -My mom when asked if I could have steampunk goggles for my birthday . " 
Home from < PROPFIRST > Kilcoyne's sweet sixteen party . So tired after dancing with < PROPFIRST > Kilcoyne , Aranya Ajith , and < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Youngblood , and NOT dancing with < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . :P 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > is convinced at least one of my friends is a creeper . 
Last year my grandma told me I was halfway to 30 . This year I'm halfway to 32 . In 5 years , I'll be halfway to the answer to the universe . Thank you to everyone for the birthday wishes . :D 
Lakeland . :D

Dude . 
So , I'm forbidden from cutting my hair . Those were my mom's exact words : \I forbid you . \"" 
My older brother just taught me how to play < PROPFEMALE>'s < PROPFEMALE > fountain song on the piano . P.S. He loved his superhero gift . :D 
This is ridiculous . And I don't even get my ice cream ! D: 
Beach ! :D
