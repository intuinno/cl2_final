Yankees game + torrential downpour = mass panic , a lot of shoving , and cranky yankee fans . 
Yankee fans are INSANE .

Football season started today . Please kill me . You will be rewarded .

Methinks thou doth protest too much , my ass . 
< PROPMALE > IDOL IS TONIGHT ! Everyone should come and support your < PROPMALE > Choir , and all of the talented performers ! Starts tonight at 7 PM in the Sigler Auditorium , admission is $1 . Just $1 ! C'mon , guys . You know you want to .

I love < PROPFIRST > . Eating cajun food at The Alligator Cafe :) 
Yesterday , I went to College Station to watch an Aggie football game . It was similar to our Yankees experience - the fans are ridiculously devoted to their team , and 90% of the crowd was drunk . They're just not nearly as unfriendly as Yankee fans . However , the best part of the day was stopping at Buc-ee's , and buying the greatest pajama pants known to man . They have beavers on them . Be envious . Be very , very envious . 
Am I the ONLY ONE who thinks making a RHPS episode of Glee is a complete abomination ? 
Okay , I freakin ' LOVE Eluveitie . Oh . My God . I dance to myself when I listen to them . 
Courtesy , subtlety , and manners are dying arts . 
HEY . You guys should like Eidetic Photography because < PROPFEMALE > Cowsert is awesome . And her photos are nifty , too . GO CHECK IT OUT . 
Going to see Los Bastardos tonight ! WOO RHPS XD 
I love my voice teacher ! 
I'm listening to the Durufle Requiem that we're performing with Flower Mound in its entirety . It's absolutely incredible , I can't wait to perform this . 
Region auditions today - oh joy . Wish me luck ! 
Oh my gawd I have an A in English now ! Let me enjoy it a little while before Mrs. Spurgeon puts in the grades for that godforsaken ' Hamlet ' test ... * shudders * 
Best 24 hours of my life . 
just recieved her acceptance letter to UNT . Step one : CHECK ! 
was accepted into the < PROPFIRST > Opera Scholars Program . Guess who's crying ? Oh , Mom , you're so predictable :] 
Life , thank you for finally turning around for me . It's greatly appreciated . 
T minus 30 days and counting :] 
I'm afraid I won't be on facebook for a bit - I'm a troublemaker , and troublemakers must be punished . < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > for now :} 
The troublemaker has returned :] 
Thank you , everyone , for the birthday greetings ! It's most appreciated :] 
I finished that GODFORSAKEN ESSAY . Thank god . 
So I'm listening to the soundtrack for the Deathly Hallows pt 1 - although I am a bit disappointed that < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > won't be returning for the final movie , the new conductor , Alexandre Desplat , has created some wonderful pieces , and I can't < PROPFEMALE > to hear them in context of the movie . Three days , 1 hour , 41 minutes and counting ! 
I REALLY wish I had those results . Off to bed . 
So < PROPMALE > Potter was phenomenal . Go see it . All of you . Right now . 
Happy Thanksgiving , everyone ! 
My cousin introduced me to his bearded dragon , < PROPFIRST > . I couldn't help but think of how < PROPMALE > would have wanted he and Socrates to be playmates . It was amusing :) 
All night cook-fest with the madre . This will be my third Thanksgiving this year . What am I thankful for ? The multiple opportunities to stuff my face with delicious , completely not-nutritious , homemade fooooood .... among other things :} 
I will never understand football lovers . 
is going to see \Black Swan\ " on Sunday ! " 
I love < PROPFEMALE > White , because she is ridiculously wonderful in every possible way , and she appreciates my geeky love of \Llamas in Hats\ " ... and can quote it verbatim with me . :D " 
I'm feeling particularly grumpy today , and for good reason . 
I have come to the conclusion that out of all of my ' friends ' , there are only three or four of them that do not make me want to inflict excruciating pain and suffering on them and others . Now if you excuse me , I'm going to go crawl under a rock and stay there until June . 
The sky is laced with pink , orange , and < PROPFEMALE > clouds , and the < PROPFEMALE > is SO full . I love being out here :} 
It makes me happy that so many people appreciate the absolute amazingness that was the lunar eclipse last night . It was pretty spectacular :] And now , we can watch the days get longer and longer ! C'moooooon , summer ... 
hopes everyone has a wonderful Christmas :D 
was given a wonderful old momento , some shiny new things , and a really big wad of cash . Yay Christmas ! 
I have discovered the magic that is The Strokes . Thank you , Alley Johnston , for sharing the pure , unadulterated awesomeness :D 
So it's the last day of 2010 . For me , this year has been so hectic , so crazy , so full of ups and downs , and frankly I'm glad it's over . Let's hope 2011 shapes up to be a little more ... smooth , I guess . 
I love having a voice teacher that knows how to get around the system ... :} 
Today's the day ! 
I got home last night and went straight to bed , so I didn't get a < PROPMALE > to put out an official Facebook congratulations to < PROPFIRST > Durrett , < PROPFEMALE > Halliburton , < PROPFEMALE > Egan , and < PROPFIRST > Malmberg for making the All-State Choirs :] When you see these guys , fellow choir folk , give them overwhelming amounts of hugs and squeals of delight for their success . 
My voice teacher is an angel . 
Hey choir folk - \ 
Dove's birthday is Saturday - don't forget to remind him he's getting ridiculously old tomorrow and wish him a happy birthday :D 
Vanilla chai tea with milk and < PROPFEMALE > , endless episode of South Park , and an audition for the college of music at UNT ( not to mention a voice lesson with a professor there AND a professor at SMU on Monday ) ... life is pretty good right now :D 
Alley Johnston :\ 
YOU ARE BUYING ME A GODDAMN BURRITO . 
I met the most incredible guy at Barnes and < PROPMALE > today ... he was brilliant and insightful , and a wonderful conversational partner ( two hours conversing with a complete stranger - it's a feat ) . Coincidence that I meet a wonderful little spark of inspiration when the beginnings of panic set in ? I doubt it . Thank you , < PROPMALE > Chynoweth , for reminding me about what it really means to be a musician . 
is feeling 1000x better about what's been thrown at me .... I think I'm gonna make it :} 
< PROPFIRST > Ousley and < PROPFIRST > any Wood : thank you :} I love you both so much . 
So ... it's ridiculously cold outside .... 
Attention LISD people : no school tomorrow . Spread the word . 
Sometimes I hate myself . 
Holy crap ... well today was ridiculously stressful . UNT College of Music auditions . We'll see where this goes ... 
New sweater ! 
College .... oh , how you overwhelm me sometimes ... 
No school again , LISD people . 
Irritation . Long , long day . It's not ending well . 
I love how you know just what to do to cheer me up :) 
Ok , which is better :\ 
1 ) ten day trip of a life time to Austria , Switzerland and Germany and go to a later registration date for UNT and get all 8 am classes\ 
or\ 
2 ) skip the trip and never have to wake up earlier than 9:30 . \ 
Ugh . 
Last Opera Scholars class :{ I'm going to miss everyone ! But this dinner's going to be a blast . 
So very sick ... I hate it when my lungs refuse to cooperate with me . 
My lungs are shutting down again ! Boy , do I love it when I slowly asphyxiate on fluids . 
Ugh . Second day of illness . Okay , lungs , start cooperating .... 
< PROPFEMALE > has beenn hacked by her amazing , beautiful , talented , intellegent sister (: love ya 
WOO made an 80 on my precalculus midterm ! Don't laugh , left brainers , this is a pretty big accomplishment :D 
This is madness .
