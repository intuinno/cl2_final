Friday came and went . < PROPFIRST > made it through the week-not missing a day of school after surgery last Thursday ! Way to go < PROPFIRST > ! Just got home from bringing < PROPMALE > to TaeKwonDo . ( He is a black belt ) . Severe thunderstorms early this morning but still high 60s-low 70s today . Need to shop for items for 6th grade camping trip ( May 10-12 ) . We never did anything like that ! Have a good one ! 
So I haven't heard down here in Trollville--what's going on with IHS that is so disappointing ? 
Took a break for gardening/landscaping . Thunderstorms today . Cold . Only 55 today , below our average . But I'm so glad I'm not in the snow ! 
< PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > gone to Howell Nature Center for 6th grade camping trip . Just me and < PROPFIRST > until Wednesday ! YAA HOOO . 
< PROPFIRST > just called and < PROPMALE > is soaked ! Both pants are wet and full of mud . Damn rain ! 
TV doesn't work this morning . . . hmmmm does that mean I can go shopping ? < PROPFIRST > will probably fix it . ( darn)\ 
Thunderstorms/rain again . . . so tired of rain . I NEED SOME SUN ! 
Off to < PROPFEMALE > Arbor with < PROPFIRST > again . Yearly , routine , x-rays and Peds . Ortho . Surgery Clinic . Once a year he is checked for spinal curvature and a quick check on his hips ( both dislocated ) . \ 
\ 
Recognize the special people you've been blessed to know . \ 
Live for today , enjoy the moment . 
Calling on Dizz , < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFEMALE > !! We will be up there July 29 -August 3 . Need babysitters for the boys . Uncle < PROPFIRST>'s class reunion Friday 30 and Sat . 1st . Are you interested . We will be staying at Country Inn and Suites in Marq . You are never home when I call !! Love yas ! Auntie < PROPFEMALE > 
For some reason while I was bringing < PROPMALE > to school this morning I was thinking of my grandma and Auntie < PROPFEMALE > ( Olson ) . Does anyone remember the Newberry store ? Not sure why but was remembering all the little chicks they used to sell around Easter . Were they colored pink and blue ? 
landscaping finally done !! \ 
< PROPMALE > has 21 days ' till summer vacation :) 
Surviving , barely , on 3-4 hours sleep . Something is up with Jimmy :( Very Crabby , did not sleep last night . Post-op visit tomorrow and got a call into nephrology on-call they are suppose to call but no one has yet ! Probably another sleepless night again . Wish I could do something for him . . . 
Post-op visit turned into a stay at hospital . I \ 
came home to spend tonight with < PROPMALE > and its Dad's turn to stay with \ 
< PROPFIRST > . < PROPFIRST > has ileus which basically means his bowels are not working \ 
correctly , actually not at all . He is getting a break from feedings and\ 
starting to get better . Hopefully tomorrow ( Wed ) we will be\ 
able to come home :) \ 
Poor fella\ 
Thank you < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > for \ 
your thoughts and prayers !! 
OK , < PROPFIRST > doing better and we will be on our way home tonight . Just waiting on paperwork . Hopefully this will be the last visit for a while . < PROPFIRST > has propably put something on his < PROPFEMALE > too . Thanks to everyone for keeping us in your thoughts and for your prayers !

Farmville Friends : Something about a horse that needs 5 neighbors to help do something ? Not sure what ? 
Time to cut the grass again !! \ 
Exchange doing snow for mowing . Sometimes not sure which is worse . . . 
Have to admit at 11:15 Saturday night I was a bit freaked-out to hear the tornado sirens going off !! Nothing happened here but 3 tornados south of us , about 45 < PROPFEMALE > . to 1 hr away 
If idiots could fly , this place would be an airport ! \ 
Dare ya to put that on a t-shirt and wear it to a family reunion 
Quiet Sunday . Its 74 with humidity of 74% . Tomorrow nice 84 ! Busy week ahead last week of school for < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST>'s last day is the 23rd . He goes during the summer after the 4th of July holiday for 6 weeks . Only half days but its a good break for me ! 
I gave this wooden sign to < PROPFIRST > for our 5th anniversary but it still works today . \ 
If at first you don't succeed , try doing it the way your wife told you . 
< PROPFIRST > home from school today at 1:30 . Building problem-too many fumes from something in the basement , I'm not sure what it was . Darn , and I was just going to start scrubbing floors . . . 
School cancelled for < PROPFIRST > . Must still stink in school from whatever it was yesterday . That means I have to bring him with me to grocery store , bank , GFS , and my doctor's appt . It's going to be one of those days ! In and out , up and down , ramp on < PROPFIRST > :( 
Tomorrow is < PROPFIRST>'s last day of school . Then off for 3 weeks and back again for 6 more weeks . < PROPFEMALE > flew in from Florida this afternoon and will stay with us for awhile before heading for the UP . And < PROPMALE > started bowling today for a few weeks this summer ; 118-111-78 were his scores . I think he was getting tired and board of bowling when the 3rd game came around . Ciao ! 
Holiday weekend -- lots of fun , BE SAFE EVERYONE !!

< PROPFEMALE > Christmas to all ! Enjoy your Holiday ! 
I miss a \real\ " city-plow-truck ! " 
To everyone who is calling for stricter gun laws in light of the tragedy in Tucson , may I offer this little tidbit : If guns kill people , then pencils misspell words , cars drive drunk , and spoons make people fat . Remember : Hold the person accountable for their actions , not the means they chose to utilize !!! Repost if you agree .. 
< PROPFIRST > still in hospital . Prayers needed . \ 
I've never seen him in so much pain . Breaks my heart . . . 2 extra doses of baclofen and so far 1 valium but still not able to sleep :( He's had about 4 hours of sleep since he woke up on Tuesday morning ! and not all together at that . I'm home now and < PROPFIRST > is with him and we will make our switch again tomorrow . I hope the doctors figure it out soon ! 
< PROPFIRST > is home ! Not fully recovered from Ileus but on the mend . THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO SENT PRAYERS AND WARM THOUGHTS !! I was greatly appreciated and they were heard :) He is still recovering and won't be back to school right away but hopefully feeds , though slow , will improve in a few days . Thank you all !! 
I believe in the right to keep and bear arms . One Facebooker has challenged all gun owners to put this on their wall . The Supreme Court of the United States has affirmed that the right to keep and bear arms is a fundamental right of the individual . If you Believe in the 2nd Amendment , and you are not afraid to show it , re-post this . 
I AM ASKING IF EVERYONE COULD PLEASE PUT THIS AS YOUR STATUS FOR ONE HOUR IF YOU OR SOMEONE YOU LOVE HAS DIABETES . I KNOW MY FAMILY WILL , MY PRAYER IS THAT IN 2011 A CURE WILL BE FOUND . WILL YOU POST IT ? JUST FOR ONE HOUR . DO IT FOR ALL OF US IN MEMORY OF TOO MANY TO MENTION AND IN HONOR OF ALL FIGHTING IT ! I HOPE TO SEE THIS ON YOUR STATUS TODAY . 
Beautiful sight today . Saw at least a group of at least 6-10 dear on Plymouth/Ann Arbor Rd today on the way to U of M hospital for urology appt . for < PROPFIRST > I don't think I have seen that many dear in one spot since Presque < PROPFEMALE > closed down . Wish I had snapped a pic . 
< PROPFIRST > went back to school today , finally ! yeah .... 
a little snow thunder happening 
20+ inches over average snowfall --- 6th all time snowiest winter ! \ 
Guess how much ? . . . . . \ 
50 some inches -- woooo hoooo ! Even that is too much ! 
The One u just called fat ? She has been starving herself & she has lost over 30lbs . The One u just called stupid ? She has a learning disability & studies over 4hrs a night . The One you just called ugly ? She spends hours putting makeup on hoping people will like her . The One you just tripped ? She is abused enough at home . There's a lot more to people than you think . Put this as your status if your against bullying 
< PROPFIRST > on his 2nd week of school-Yeah !! All the screaming and leg kicking he was doing we thought because of pain somewhere ? They were actually seizures !! Increased one of his seizure meds and he is back to his happy-smiley-self again . \ 
Poor fella ! Wish it didn't take 2 months before we figured that out !! The seizures were not like any he had in the past . But he is doing good now , ( knock on wood ) . 
I personally believe in Jesus Christ . One facebooker has challenged all believers to put this on their wall . The Bible says , if you deny Me in front of your peers , I will deny you in front of my Father . This is a simple test . If you love God and you are not afraid to show it , re-post this . 
< PROPFIRST > having more seizures this past weekend and today . Hopefully increase in meds will help again ! 
Doesn't make sense , does it ? Homeless in the US go without eating . Elderly in the US go without needed medicines . Mentally ill in the US go without treatment . American troops go without proper equipment . American veterans go without benefits that were promised . Yet we donate billions to other countries before helping our own first . 1% will re-post and 99% won't . Have the guts to re-post this . I KNOW I'M IN THE 1% 
If your Dad is , or was , a hard working man , and is your hero , has helped you no matter how good or bad you were , and is just the best Dad ever ; if you are blessed to still have your Dad , or if he is an angel in Heaven , paste this to your status and let everyone know you are proud of your Dad 
5th Annual Bowling FUNdraiser for Old Village School ( PTA ) was a BIG success ! There is always time to donate-just let me know and I will send you a tax deductible form in the mail !

Thanks you to our < PROPFIRST > sponsors , bowlers , Novi Bowl , our staff , and our volunteers ! It was a fantastic day !
