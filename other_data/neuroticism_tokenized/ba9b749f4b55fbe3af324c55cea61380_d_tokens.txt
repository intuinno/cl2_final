READ\ 
CAREFULLY ! CHANGE YOUR PICTURES BACK ! The group asking everyone to \ 
change their profile picture to a cartoon character is actually a group of\ 
PEDOPHILES doing it because kids will accept their friend request \ 
faster if they see a cartoon picture . It has NOTHING to do with \ 
Child .. Violence/NCPCC . It was on the news earlier today about internet frauds & it will be on TONIGHT'S news ... PLEASE COPY AND PASTE THIS 
Pizza is the best food ever invented .
