Aaaand .... got a $2.00 an hour surprise raise from my boss yesterday ..... yaaaaay . Plus my man is making profound progress at Roque ! God is Great and life is good ! Miracles are happening all around me and I couldn't be more grateful . Some it up in one word : PROGRESS !

PO visit down . Now at work . Have to leave early for women's group and then ..... have individual therapy . Sigh ..... a day in the life of DC ! Ya feelin me ? 
I Love my Manny ! 
Can't believe the miracles God keeps bringing my way ! Bursting with joy and profound gratitude . The road of recovery I am traveling is a truly blessed one ! Hallelujah !!!

Happy Saturday ! Goin to visit my man at Roque and have a picnic - suweet ! Then meeting with my sponsor for a meeting at Fullerton Alano ! Going to church tomorrow morning with dear loved ones ! Such a great weekend ahead . Thank you God for my life , my loved ones , and the great friends you've brought into my life ! 
Off to get the mani/pedi then commitment meeting tonight ! Had a wonderful day with my sponsor . The weekends fly by much too fast but the bright side is that it's another week closer to graduation !!! Yay me ! 
Letting go makes us wealthier . Wealth is never measured by what we have , but by what we can give away . We are < PROPMALE > with money when we can afford to donate . We are < PROPMALE > with love when we can give love freely . We are < PROPMALE > with God when we can behold our enemies with compassion . 
So I just got completely lost in the moment as I'm sitting at my desk & a Monarch butterfly starts hovering outside my office window . I watch it fly around so delicately then perch on a tree branch . I can't stop watching it & realize how grateful I am to revel in God's beauty today AND ... with a clear mind . Then of course a car drives by & scares it away :-( Bottom Line : Today I am blessed for such moments as these ! 
How bad things may look right now means nothing . It's how good they can be with God's help that counts . In life we can absolutely count on one thing - everything can turn around in one day , sometimes in one minute . We don't dare to give up - we could be a moment away from a windfall . 
Difficult people are very important in our lives . They teach us tolerance and acceptance . If all was going our way all the time , we would become spoiled children . Difficult people are just one of the ways God teaches us to expand beyond our egos and accept other perspectives in life . 
When we pursue our dreams , every second is an encounter with God . Following our dreams opens our hearts allowing God to enter and fill us with bliss . 
So grateful for where my life is today ! Have no regrets from the past because it's all part of the road traveled that has brought me to where I am today ! So grateful for the miracles God is creating in me and my life and His blessings are plentiful ! Lord , thank you for Your Grace ! 
My man and I are swimming at my house today , making steak and crab legs for dinner , enjoying each others presence , and loving life sober ! Just need the kids to be here and my day would be entirely complete . < PROPFEMALE > my dear , < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Faith is exactly what it takes to get through uncertainty . Faith is not necessary when we know how things are going to work out - that's knowledge . It's in the time of unknowing that having faith is what sees us through to the other side . Faith is what gives us strength . Faith is that light in our hearts that keeps on shining even when it's dark all around us . NOW ..... is the time to keep your faith alive ! 
Well , I am 1 year old today ! Only took me 2 and half years to get here ! And the greatest gift I received ..... GRATITUDE ! I'm a happy and proud gal today ! Thank you God - couldn't have done it without your blessings !

Lost a $100 < PROPMALE > on Monday & just noticed today ! Feeling angry at myself , I decided to pray & turn it over to God so I didn't have to let it ruin my whole day . Figured it was a long-shot , but went to ask my co-workers if any of them had found it . THANK GOD there are still honest people in the world today . A fellow employee found it in the ladies restroom and gave it back to me ! So amazing the power of prayer ! :-)

Every Christmas you always hear people saying what they want or bought . Well this is what I want . I want people who are sick with no cure to be able to be cured . I want children with no families to be adopted . I want people to never have to worry about food and shelter and heat . People who need jobs to get one . Now lets see how many people re-post this who actually care . 
So ... up in that small town with high altitude once again ... that's right , bIg bEaR !!! Celebration for < PROPFEMALE > pAnDa'S 15th Birthday ! More special memories in the making :-) Gosh , I love my life ... ( sigh ) ... It's that simple . 
Well Monday is not starting off well . Couldn't go to work cuz my ride wouldn't start in Corona last night on the way home from Big Bear . Now I'm borrowing my roommates car to go back and have it towed to a repair shop . Say a prayer guys ! Recovery requires a tight budget . And to top it all off , couldn't squeeze into my jeans this morning either - yikes !

Okay , so day FIVE without a cigarette for Manny & I . On the way to taking him to work this morning he was griping about having one . I asked him if he's ever tried to quit before and how long he lasted . He said yes and it lasted FIVE days . Today's a big hurdle for him - keep him in your prayers guys . And me , you ask ? Well , I got this ! Just want him to make it .

There are more of us who want you than those who don't! Thank You Lord , I Love you . ( Re-post if you agree )

From CNN : NASA reports , that by the next 10 months , earth gets hotter by 4 degrees from now . Himalayan glaciers are melting at rapid rate . Our climate is changing drastically and it's getting worse . So we must help fight Global Warming by doing the following steps : Plants more trees , Don't waste water , water is so precious . Use cloth bag instead of plastic . Don't burn plastic . And RE-POST this . SAVE OUR PLANET !

My mom made me laugh ... Wiped my tears ... Hugged me tight ... Watched me succeed ... Saw me fall ... Cheered me on ... Kept me going strong .... And ... Drove me a little crazy at times ...

National Geographic's World Water Day Fact : Only 2.5 percent of all the water on Earth is fresh—and about two-thirds of that is frozen . That leaves less than one percent to grow our crops , cool our power plants , and supply drinking water and bathing water for households . Just some food ( or water ) for thought ! 
Recipe for Life : Take one new day . Add a smile . Stir in laughter . Sprinkle generously with love . Bake gently for 24 hours . Enjoy every moment and repeat . 
Sigh ... Please join me in remembering a great icon of the entertainment community . The Pillsbury Doughboy died yesterday of a yeast infection & trauma from repeated pokes to the belly . He was 71 .

The funeral was held at 3:50 for about 20 minutes . 
Copy this and put it in your status if you know someone or have heard of someone who knows someone or have heard of someone who may know someone ; or if you don't know anyone or even if you've just heard of someone who doesn't know anyone then still copy this .... It's important to spread the message . Oh , and the hearts ? ? ? ? for crap's sake don't forget the hearts ! ? ? ?........... LMAO !!!!! 
To Thine Own Self Be True . - The person emerging in our recovery is one we truly like . Where has that person been ? Our ego put it down , called it inadequate , ugly , and no good . Our Program has helped put a lid on our egos and our true self is becoming a wonderful friend . -- I do not live my life , nor do I have to change to please anyone . It is to myself that I shall be true . 
Okay , so I know that God just put these words before my eyes for a definite reason : \Never waste a minute of your precious life by squandering it thinking about people you don’t like . \ " ~ Unknown ~ " 
Q : Why did the blonde snort artificial sweetener ? \

Dear God , I come to you as humbly as I know how . I confess my sins , those known and unknown . Lord , you know I am not perfect and I fall short everyday of my life , but I want to take time out to say thank you for your mercy . Thank you for my health , my family and friends , the roof over my head , food on my table , and everything I have . Re post if GOD has blessed you in any way ... absolutely worthy of a re-post !!
