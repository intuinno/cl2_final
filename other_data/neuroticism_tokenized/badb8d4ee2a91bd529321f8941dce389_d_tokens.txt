Is it just me , or did this week start out horribly ? 

Why am I up ? Why else ? It's story time . Just ... Not for you people . 
School . It's always there . Me ... I was there , then I wasn't .... No seriously . I was . \Was . \"" 
Time to chill ? I think so ... 
Hiding from the enemy is hard . Hiding in plain sight is easy . Becoming invisible however , only belongs to those who hold Secrecy . 
Just want to wish everyone a happy holiday ! ~ 
I think I'm allowed to wish everyone an official < PROPFEMALE > Christmas now ! 
I'm never going to get work done after this all starts .... 
No ! I watch you and you don't watch me ! 
As of today ... There shall be no more love for anyone . 
\Where does this go ? \"" 
\So if I ever see you on the street / Ill pretend that I didnt see / And turn my face / No use in small talk anyways \"" 
Summer school ... Oh the joy ... 
For those who felt it , 5.7 in SoCal . South of Palm Springs . 
Meh ... Fun but it could have been better ... 
Complete virus take over of my laptop ! \ 
What ? 
Huh . Look at that . 2:30 am exactly . 
Muse is a good way to end the week . Mhmm . 
I believe the obsession has finally hit ... Thank you for a totally free weekend .
