Last year I mismanaged my funds and this year my family and I cannot decide on a budget . Until we can come to a unified decision that fits all of our needs and interests , we will have to shut down our check book and will no longer be able to pay our taxes . I'm sure you'll understand . Thank you very much for setting an example we can all follow . \

It takes 7 seconds for food to pass from mouth to stomach . A human hair can hold 3kg . The length of a penis is 3 x the length of the thumb . The femur is as hard as concrete . A woman's heart beats faster then a man's . Women blink 2 x as much as men . We use 300 muscles just to keep our balance when we stand . A woman has read this entire post . The man is still looking at his thumb . Repost if this made you laugh !

HOW TO GET YOUR FEED BACK TO NORMAL AGAIN . if you want your feed to go back to normal hit the down arrow next to home and then go to account settings , on the left side you will see NOTIFICATIONS , click on that . At the top right is a box that says notification settings , then see the box called email frequency . Uncheck that box and your feed will show all the posts again . Then go to your home < PROPFEMALE > and anything in the \Top Stories\ " click on the down arrow in the upper right and \ " unmark as top story\ " - now your newsfeed will be setup by timestamp rather than randomly picking \ " top stories ! \ " PLEASE PASS THIS ALONG "

THIS IS TRUE !! On September 31st , 2011 Facebook will start charging you for your account . To avoid this , you MUST get NAKED , stand on your dining room table and do the Macarena , all the while singing I Will Survive . After filming and posting it to your Facebook wall and YouTube , then , and only then , will < PROPFIRST > Zuckerberg come down your chimney to tell you that your account will stay free . Pass it on 
Well , looks as though the tow company is getting my < PROPFEMALE > , and I will be sueing someone else for this , and the value of the vehicle .
