I've seriously never had someone who I care about this much treat me this way .

Gaga wore a meat dress in order to stand up for gay fans ? Too bad you just offended anyone who stands up for animal rights . In my opinion she is a freakin LOON ! Get a life you creep I mean its comparable to fur , skin , and any other part used for clothes , shoes , etc ! She was all emotional over the military , our fallen soliders but who cares about the animal you hacked up to make your stinky , rotting dress ? Ignorance . 
Out with the girlies tonight ! =)

I am starting to hate Eagles fans almost as much as Steeler fans ... Both talk tooo much .. shutttt it ! You both have morally corrupt quarterbacks so no they aren't amazing nor Gods and neither of your teams will win the superbowl this year anyways . Relax . 
Ew Jersey Shore needs to cut Sammi .. shes boring , rude , and just takes up space .. 
Would really love to know why the church across the street continues to have their chimes play Christmas songs every night ... for 30 minutes . Sorry but its annoying . 
Sailor is very happy Vick threw that interception ! =) BAHAHAHAAAA 
Brit Spearssss is back ! Bahaa love it <3

Can this snow please melt .. my car continues to get suck in the dumbest parking lot EVER ! If I somehow get out , then I can't get back in . Parking in the backyard for now .. ha ! 
Shouldn't have watched that < PROPFEMALE > Knox movie on lifetime . It gives me an uneasy feeling ... such a chilling story . 
Thanks for the birthday wishes everyone ! Cupcake making time !! 
This hasn't been the easiest month ... heading back to Elk co . just Sailor and I . </3 
Just spent a year and a half on the biggest waste of life in the world . Once a liar always a liar . . .
