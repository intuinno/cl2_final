Going back to Jersey . 

In Jersey ' til the 25th of this month -- then moving back to Sarasota FL 
today my day is dedicated to classwork . boy oh boy ! -- at least it's miserable and pouring outside .. i'm just going to stay in jammies . :) 
working one to eight . 
working out for a bit .. then classwork . -- work was so draining today ! :( 
poppin ' in a movie , lying down , & crashing . night . 
working noon to six . maybe later . -- football day today ..! YAY ! 
dying my roots . doing classwork . & quitting my job . yep . 
well , the past 2 days have been sh*t . today/night has been terrible . but on the brightside , i made some bangin ' tacos and my belly is stuffed ..!! 
was going to go to the beach , but didn't . -- i didn't wanna go alone & my mama didn't feel like going after telling me she would . errgghh !! looks like a classwork day . boy oh boy ! 
how ' bout those boys ?! 7-21 < PROPFIRST > !! yeaahh mang !! :) 
new crappy photos .. ohh boyyyy !!! 
hahahahahaaaaa . fml . 
i swear .. if i have swine flu .. ima m*rda some b*tches . arghhhhhh !!! :( 
work til eight . 
when being told sweet things , which you believe are sincere , you get the whole butterflies in your tummy , and a big smile on your face . -- then once you find out it's all repeated lines from the past , without meaning , that feeling is no longer there when you hear those things ... only words . hollow , empty , meaningless words ... 
i always wanted my life to play out like a movie .. and as of lately , it has . however , i was thinking and hoping more along the lines of a romance , not a dramatic tradgey . 
can't sleep !! & i have this stupid paper to write . gah ! 
immitation poptarts are disgusting . 
i definitely stayed up past 8am writing four papers for bio class . man , i need to stop procrastinating . -- workin ' from 6 til volume decrease .. lets hope it's early . more classwork to do ! boy oh boy !!! 
wow . what a LONG crazy night at work . i'm actually sleepy fairly early for the first time in awhile . thank goodness . 
keep your friends close , and your enemies closer . 
i swear i hear my name being said 2 minutes and 44 seconds into the song \slide\ " by the goo goo dolls . -- probably just going crazy .. but it's been driving me nutty . " 
workin ' 6 til 11 then a ton ton ton of classwork .. that i don't want to do . anyone want to help ? :) 
needs to catch a second wind to complete all of my classwork . ugh ! 
wants to go see paranormal activity tonight . 
i can't sleep . i'm wide awake . i feel like it's 6 in the afternoon . this is rediculous ! 
gah ! i don't frickin ' knowwww !!!!! * angry face * 
... don't cha under-estimate the intelligence of this blonde ..!! :) working 6 til volume decrease .. probably meaning not ' til after one in the morning . oh joy ! -- then classwork . busy , busy , girl . bleh . -- keep me company & sane while i'm at work .. text it . 
there are some insane jumping crickets down here that have no sense of direction .. i had two jump on me tonight and it freaked me out , a lot . -- damn florida and its creepy bugs .. 
i cannot wake up by alarms to save the life of me .. i need to be up at 9:30 . i set eight of them . lets pray it works . haha . night night . 
MISERABLE day at work today . thank god it's over . - i really need to find a new job ASAP . 
so , i bought one of those 2 lb bags of < PROPMALE > wonka ' mix up ' < PROPFEMALE > . for trick-or-treaters & for me to pick on some laffy taffy ' til the 31st . there were 22 banana laffy taffys and 4 strawberry . i hate the banana ones . dissapointed . 
working 6 - 11 . hopefully i'll get out early . 
tons & tons of homework to get done before midnight tonight . gah ! no fun . gonna be really BUSY for the next few hours . that's what i get for procrastinating .. 
i cannot believe it's november already . this really hasn't hit me yet . -- i miss jersey autumn weather . :( 
had a long stressful day , but then night ended well . -- in a much better mood now ! thank goodness ..!! :) 
WARNING : Do NOT go so the movie ' Where the Wild Things Are ' if you are depressed or are having suicidal thoughts . -- Seriously , that movie could really push someone over the edge . It is definitely not a happy movie . 
headache . crappy weather . bad day at work . :( bleh . just ready to go to sleep & have a new day begin . 
endless classwork today . ehh . but get to see my man tonight ; & busch gardens tomorrow ?! 
i need a vacation . 
66 degrees down here & i'm freezing . guess living in florida thinned my blood -- i'm so happy that it's cooling down though , maybe it will start to actually feel like november . finally time to wear long sleeves ! YAY ! :) 
this is what I get for procrastinating .. 6 assignments to do for the remainder of today plus 3 tests . already did 8 assignments today .. i'm getting burnt out with these online classes . 
i just realized ; the majority of my current life revolves around school , work , & cleaning . i hardly do anything else .. 
so , it's almost midnight . i'm trying to finish this 17 < PROPFEMALE > paper before i go to sleep ; i've only accomplished 5 1/2 < PROPFEMALE > s . -- it's gonna be a long night . :( 
14 outta 17 pages finished ; almost done ! i can't wait to finish this stupid paper ' cause tonight is date night with my man ..!! :) 
it's going to be one of those day .. i could just tell already . & the crappy rainy weather isn't going to help contribute to making this day any better . blehck . 
... my gut was telling me that today was going to be a very bad day . apparently , my gut never fails . * sigh *

Took Bentley to the vet today to get his shots today . He was such a good boy . He loses his ' manly-hood ' in 12 days .. my poor bubboo . :( 
Mmm ... Panera . :) 
I was eating some wasabi flavored dry roasted edamame & my dog was begging . I gave him 1/2 of one thinking he wouldn't like the painfully pleasant sinus clearing wasabi flavor & it would stop his begging . I was wrong ; he ate it then kept begging for more . Then he went up to the bag , picked it up by his mouth and brought it to his bed . I got a kick out of this . He must really like them . I guess I'm easily amused ... 
Went to the beach with my mom today ; & boy did I get some much needed color ! 
10 days down ; 10 more to go ! Can't wait for my man to come home ! I'm missin ' him ! 
Going to the gym .. actually not working out at home . First time in over a year ! 
\There are no short cuts to any place worth going . \ " -- < PROPFEMALE > Sills " 
If you don't push your limits you'll never know what you're capable of .. 
Halfa bottle of wine to my face && I'm callin ' it a night . Night . 
Gym .. work 5- close .. then out with the girls :) 
While on my phone I guess I entered the ' incorrect pattern ' a few too many times and it locked up . It asked me to enter my email & password ; so I did .. & it's still not unlocking . DAMN DROID . 
I have been having the absolute worst luck this month . -- Yeah , I don't like July much . Hurry up and be over with already . 
He who hesitates , regrets . 
Rays game tonight with < PROPFEMALE > A . Levy :) 
Vanilla Ice Ice Baby ... Ooh Yeah ! ;) 
I live with very minimal regrets because everyone who once mattered to me , or any obstacles that came my way which I wasn't happy of at the time ; made me the person I am today . Without those peoples ' impact & without learning from mistakes I once made I wouldn't be me ; & I am very happy with the person I have become . 
\Waiting for an egg to hatch that has nothing inside will get you nowhere . \"" 
I have my droid back !! :) 
Pedicure , manicure , sushi & laying out by the pool .. Sounds like a good day off work to me . 
Haven't been feelin ' so hot today :( -- but going to grab Japanese for dinner with my mom ! 
Working 6 ' til close . Stop by Evies Tavern on the Range tonight and say hello to the girls and I . We'd appreciate the company . :) 
\People are like dirt . They can either nourish you and help you grow as a person or they can stunt your growth and make you wilt and die . \ " -- Plato " 
Out with my mom for all you can eat sushi . :) 
I fell in love .. with a MV Agusta F4-SPR . <3 Maybe it's only lust .. but damn , she's good . 
Not even five o'clock on a Tuesday afternoon and all of the loonies are out .. I swear . I cannot wait to get home from work and have two consecutive days off . 
A day with my lovely < PROPFEMALE > Kouvatsos <3 Mani , pedi , STARBUCKS , shopping . Fantastic . :)

Lunch with mom :) 
Ugh . Not feeling so hot today ... :(

I feel like I just ate my body weights worth of calzone .. ugh ! Stuffed ; for once .. 
i think my phone is on its last dying breath .. 
I seriously make some kick a ** smoothies ! yum .. :) 
Technology has not been my friend for the past 24 hours .. * sigh * 
Today has been a pretty productive day .. a lot has been accomplished . But my phone has pretty much completely given out on me :( Getting a new phone is next on my must do list . Thinkin ' late dinner with mom then renting a couple movies .. 
Love those guys at Verizon !! Apparently I'll be getting a new phone much sooner than expected because I'm getting the ultimate hook up ! ( Well maybe not quite , but I will be saving $550 ) Can't wait ! About two more weeks & Droid 2 you will be alllll mine !!!! :)

Someone help < PROPFEMALE > & I find somewhere in St Peted to eat ' cause right now we're lost lost in the ghetto & almost got hit by a school bus by a trailer park !! ** 
So , I've come to the conclusion that Lysol Pacific Fresh Scent All Purpose Cleaner smells just like Joop colonge for men ... which by the way , I find to be hilarious because it's the ' < PROPMALE > man colonge ' hmm .. 
Come to Evies on < PROPFEMALE > Ridge to watch college football & visit the lovely ladies & I . Take advantage our new football drink specials too ! You know you wanta !! ;)

Nuttellaaaaa <3 
My next investment will be for a new pair of running shoes . Maybe a pair of rollerblades too ! Anyone want to start going rollerblading or biking trails with me now that we are beginning to have nice , cooler weather ?! 
Decided to go to the beach on a wimb to try to escape reality for a bit & right when I got there I saw the most vivid meteor .. it was absolutely gorgeous . 
Definitely have been on an ever-so-random oar kick for the past 24 hours .. But can't find the live at msg version of ' heard the world ' video . Disappointing . 
Work at 3 ; stop on by :) 
Ah , I love pedicures <3 
My boys made me proud tonight ! :) 
Need a new phone already .. its only been a little over a month . Thank god for insurance .. 
When you know , you know .. that's all there is to it .

Got my new phone in the mail today !! I am no longer phone-less ! :) 4th droid in 7 months .. ridiculous . 
Thinking about going to Jersey for a few days in December .. 
Nothing ventured , nothing gained .
