is rocking her new laptop , and doesn't care even the tiniest bit about New Year's . 

Too much sleeping , not enough eating . We need to get the oven working so I can have pizza . 
Ahmadinejad called them dust , they showed him a sandstorm . 
Messages from Iran : # when all these troubles behind us i will get my camera back and go to the park with my daughter # i will bring my brother and girl friend and we will say mullahs are so old their ideas are not modern and we will laugh and be free # h 
has the house to herself until Sunday . Expect lots of half-naked lounging about and sleeping , when not watching lesbian porn . 
wonders why it has to be so hot ? x.x 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > !!!!!! D: 
June is officially THE MONTH OF DEATH 
is watching her first J-Drama ( besides Seven Female Lawyers , which , well ... is called Seven Female Lawyers for godssake ) . Wish her luck ! 
just got back from New Orleans . Pictures later . 
is going to bed now that pictures have successfully been posted . 
has been Facebook stalking old middle school acquaintances and is becoming surprisingly emotional about it , considering she never gave a fuck about high school . 
intends to fall asleep to Thumbs Down . See you all in a few hours . 
has just been smacked in the side of the head with an unbearable craving for hot tea . 
Sleepy sleeping in preparation for the invasion of my personal space by < PROPFEMALE>'s ' friends ' in the near future . 
is busy worrying about Mr. Muffin's newborn kittens . x.x ; 
< PROPMALE > Goldblum LIVES ! Hopefully in my pants . 
is not looking forward to the sudden influx of graduation party-goers she will soon be experiencing . ;P 
s preparing to embark on an exciting adventure to Tennessee to < PROPFEMALE > out with her grandparents for a week . An exciting adventure during which she will hopefully be sleeping . 
has finally managed to sneak , ninja-like and with all due stealth , on to the internet at her grandparents in Tennessee . Fun is being more or less had , although their crazy cat keeps randomly attacking my hand . -___- 
is logging off to go play Animal Crossing on her DS , and then maybe eventually go to sleep . 
is finally back home ! Rejoice , you heathens ! 
is finally going to see < PROPMALE > Potter and the Half-Blood < PROPMALE > this evening ! Rejoice , you heathens ! 
has returned from < PROPMALE > Potter and the Half-Blood < PROPMALE > . Missed some of the little things ( and one GIANT thing ) that were omitted from the film , but , all and all , perhaps her favorite one thus far . 
Social Experiment : if you read this , even if we don't speak often , post a comment with a memory of you and me . It can be anything you want , either good or bad . When you're finished , post this paragraph on your own status and you will be surprised with wha 
is very busy preparing to watch Watchmen . 
is trying to decide what she would rather spend her non-existent cash reserves on - an adorable ball-jointed doll , or the new Shiina Ringo album ... 
thinks that the Director's Cut of Watchmen was awesome . 
Although I have to admit that there was one particular transition which , when I realized was no longer there , was a jolt . I'm not quite sure how I feel about the flow of that one < PROPFEMALE > part ... but the rest was smokin ' . 
is going to bed . ... Or reading Watchmen fanfiction . Whatever . 
is going to bed ... eventually . 
is hanging out , eating a < PROPFEMALE > , going to take a nap . 
woke up after a 17-hour-nap and is feeling like shit , and just found out one of the cats she hand-raised last summer is dead . Happy July 26th . :P 
is now convinced that < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is the best thing since sliced bread . 
doesn't want to do dishes and will pay good money to the person who would like to come do them instead . :P 
has recently been 135 feet underground . 
is checking out fun e-bay deals on Japanese clothes , then going to bed . 
is busy worrying herself needlessly over JET application minutiae . 
loves her little sister , < PROPFEMALE > . Who happened to notice she left her facebook up . Muahahahaha :) 
is going to be wearing an adorable sweater soon . 
has fallen in love with sagemono , but really doesn't have the money for such an adorable collecting hobby . 
is going to try watching Supernatural . After all of this Dean/Sam talk , figures she has to give it a try just once . 
Woo hoo ! Thunderstorm ! 
My goddamn mouse is broken . I did throw it a couple of times , but that usually helps instead of hindering . -___- 
Project Runway All-Star Challenge : FFFFFFFFFFFFU 
Can't wait to go home . 
is way too hungry . ;P 
' s harddrive doesn't like her any more . Luckily , she has a back up , but , seriously , could this have happened any closer to the start of the semester ? x___x 
' s computer is fixed , but not actually fixed . Hooray ! xD 
Must ... not ... eat ... all of the Apple Cinnamon Cheerios . > < 
is missing : Battery Charger , Mouse , Duct Tape , and most likely a few other things as well .

' s phone works now ! Her phone number is 330 829 2863 . 
' s phone works now ! Her phone number is 330 829 2831 . 
- I stay up late and I don't do anything productive . 
Feel like going right back upstairs and passing out for the day . Note to Self : Please stop thinking its an awesome idea to go to bed at 4am . 
hates studying for tests . 
It's fall break , bitches ! 
is vaguely tipsy off something called Seagram's . 
can't sleep . Luckily , the only demands of her class tomorrow are watching a movie and hanging out with a cute girl . :) 
Time for a nap and a shower and some homework . In that order . 
Will soon be cutting into her delicious pomegranate . 
is the happy owner of a thousand delicious pomegranate seeds . 
has the brainwurms . :( 
just got back from watching Paranormal Activity . 
just watched the film 12 Monkeys in Philosophy and Film class . Still thinking through it . < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > really likes off-key sci-fi movies . 
60 votes in the Senate , bbs !! But EXPRESSIONS OF APPROVAL ARE NOT ALLOWED . Senator Dodd's such a killjoy . 
Gone to watch Twilight . God help us all . 
Reactions to New Moon : What is this I don't even D: 
Just finished her Statement of Purpose for the JET application ! I never thought it would be so hard to write a two-page paper . ( No , you can't read it . ) 
has turned in her JET application - I have been assured it will arrive at its destination by tomorrow at noon . Now I'm going to laze about and watch the news . 
Is sick and hungry , but way too lazy to walk to lunch on her own . 
Can't think , can't sleep . Go , research paper , go ! 
Is done with any < PROPMALE > papers/tests/what-have-you for the next four weeks . Finals continue to be a joke . 
God does not exist . Comment in 6-7 pages . 
Completed her most difficult exam this semester through a combination of an hour-and-a-half of furious writing and staring up at the ceiling blankly every few minutes . 
is the head of security . Everything is under control . 
' s last final exam is done . Her thumb is going to fall off ( much like the ' 6 ' key on her laptop keyboard did this morning ) , but in the meantime she is going to play World of Warcraft . 
just woke up from a horrible dream . Ugh . 
is officially back home ! 
Health Care Reform in the Senate marches on ! Final Vote on Thursday , here I come !

WoW While Drunk = Most Awesome 
' s entire mouth and bottom part of her face is numb . But the procedure itself was pretty awesome . Now if only she could swallow . 
Back home early , with no blankets . Awesome . :P 
is going through the Facebook profiles of old friends from < PROPFIRST > . It's strange . I guess on some level you expect these people's lives to stop the moment you go away , and it's a little surreal to know that they don't - that these children that exist only in your memories might now be adults that you could have actual conversations with . 
Really , really doesn't want to go to her two-and-a-half-hour long evening class tonight . Will continue refreshing her school email until she is dragged to dinner . 
No Sailor Neptune ? Unacceptable ! 
No adorable Chibi < PROPFEMALE > ? Unacceptable !

gets to go buy a dress tomorrow ! Is super excited since she actually enjoys getting dressed up ... although perhaps not the part where she has to spend money to do so . 
Can omniscient God , who knows the future , find the omnipotence to change His future mind ?

ADDENDUM TO EMERGENCY : Oh , it was actually the cap I had put on my tooth after I chipped it as a little kid . Return to your normally scheduled programs , people . 
Four teenage boys have killed themselves in the last week after suffering horrible abuse and bullying for being gay . They ranged from middle-schoolers to college students . This is heart-breaking , and it has to stop . No difference of opinion , on any ... subject , should ever lead ... to someone losing their life , and bullying , torment , and abuse are unacceptable . Believe this ? Repost it . 
Who wants to guess how many zeroes are in the grand total for my student < PROPFEMALE > payment ? It'll be a nice glimpse into some of your futures . ;P
