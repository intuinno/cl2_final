had a really amazing start to the weekend :) < PROPMALE > Goldbach , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > Feick , all of you are made of awesome . 
There comes a time in life when you walk away from all the drama and those who create it . You surround yourself with people who make you laugh , forget the bad and focus on the good . So love the people who treat you right and pray for the ones who don't . Life is too short to be anything but happy . Falling down is part of LIFE ; getting back up & moving forward is LIVING ! Re-post if you agree . 
Beasted my last exam , got an A on my final paper , Saxby's date with @ < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > later and North East tonight with some pretty awesome people . An excellent last day of winter session , indeed :) 
yeah , definitely wrote ' grabbing life by the cojones ' as part of the title of my final paper . peace out , winter session . it's been real .

so excited to add another amazing little , < PROPFEMALE > Zibreg , to the family !

I love all of my ? isters so much ! <3 Yay ! Exclamation points ! !!!! 
No matter how much it upsets me when they do so , no one is going to have any authority to tell me how to live my life or that any academic or career decision I make is stupid and foolish . I'm sick of pleasing other people and now I need to do what's good for me . 
had my first good day at school in the entire five weeks I've been student teaching .. hey , better late than never , I suppose ! Hopefully tomorrow will follow suit ( which it should , since < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > is coming to Delaware ! ) :) 
ok , for reals this time : what on earth should i give up for lent ? and no , giving up lent for lent is not a real answer . giving up student teaching would be great .. if only that were a viable option . 
is having SUCH a good week !! Finally !! :D 
Praying for those affected by the earthquake and tsunami <3 
is very excited for < PROPFEMALE>'s First Day of Spring FREE Italian Ice Giveaway 2011 ! with my awesome little , < PROPFEMALE > Zibreg , for < PROPFEMALE>'s Senior Flute Recital after that , and University of Delaware Wind Ensemble featuring Dr. < PROPMALE > Tychinksi after that ! Excellent day today :) 
Woah .. my fifth graders actually .. LIKE me ?! And will MISS me ?! This is a whole new concept ! Excellent day today :) Hopefully the next two will follow suit , followed by a wonderfully awesome Friday , complete with Morning Munchies ( aka free foooood ) , two DSO assemblies and to top it all off , finally getting to go HOME for the first time in two months ! :) 
Done with Placement #1 ! Got sooo many hugs and a super-sweet card from some of my 5th-graders . I'm going to miss those kids so much ! And now , it's time to go homeward bound ! :) 
Aaaaaaand cue reality . Such an awesome day . I wish this could last forever . Or at least figure out where my life is going .. that would be great , too . 
Officially starting at Haverford tomorrow . 3 hours of driving a day , I can already tell you're going to get old fast . Hopefully this will be worth it . 
will officially be back on Lawn Guyland three weeks from tonight .. for six whole days ! Super excited :) 
i would be one to pass out while playing flute with fourth graders during summer woodwinds class today .. and right at the end of baa baa black sheep . slightly embarrassing , but mostly hilarious . gotta love it . 
I cried out with no reply and I can't feel You by my side , so I'll hold tight to what I know ; You're here and I'm never alone . 
can and WILL get through this . just watch me . 
18 lesson plans and 28 daily logs to go .. lolz . 
11 lesson plans left , and those damn 28 daily logs . So much for sleeping/going to choir these next two days ! And of course , again .. lolz .
