\You are in danger of drowning in the world of the senses ; ours is the danger of suffocating in an airless void . You are an artist ; I am a thinker . \"" 
Should never open a bottle of wine on a work night unless she has someone to help her finish it ... 
It takes 7 seconds for food to pass from mouth to stomach . A human hair can hold 3kg . The length of a penis is 3 times the length of the thumb . The femur is as hard as concrete . A woman's heart beats faster then a man's . Women blink 2x as much as men . We use 300 muscles just to keep our balance when we stand . A woman has read this entire post . The man is still looking at his thumb . Repost if this made you smile 
mellow day watching cartoons and snuggling with the fella . life is good . <3 
Suck it up , kitten . Tuff as nails . 
going out for drinks , then sleepover with < PROPFEMALE > Hughes . i assure you , there will be pillowfights . 
Forgot how gross cigarettes are . Thanks < PROPFEMALE > for the reminder . ;) 
Any interest in a late crafternoon this evenin' ?

bright heart , soothed soul , & now to take a shower to take care of the physical part ... 
Will be taking the scenic route everywhere today .

Had an awful dream my tarabella & I were attacked by a fierce raccoon . I had to < PROPMALE > it off us with a stick ! 
I understand it must be difficult to be only 4 feet tall and bald , but if you ask nicely instead of ordering me to do a task in a douchey manner , I'll oblige . 
is thinking artichoke & ice cream for dinner , then snugglin ' battycat & tarabean while watching a chick flick is tonight's post-work agenda . 
Artichoke + ranch = ace ! Half pint of denali moose tracks & wondering why it took so long to watch \mean girls . \""

Too damned early looks like too damned early-give or take an hour . Whoops ... late to work . 
Wonder if you can tell that bus drivers smoke based on if they wait for the transit tracker to catch up to them . Also , busses today seem to have an extra dose of plague . Thanks to < PROPFEMALE > for a shot of vodka to kill the germs ! 
One of my housemates just caught baby . I don't want to live with a pregnant woman or child , so will be househunting very soon . Anyone looking for a roomie ? I come with an antique labrador , joint package .
