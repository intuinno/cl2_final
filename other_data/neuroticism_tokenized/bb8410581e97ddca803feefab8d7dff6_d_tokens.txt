the bedroom is the site of where we can do the two most enjoyable things in life 
hooray for driving safely ! 
hmm , watching tv , napping , playing video games makes for a pretty lame sunday 
hooray for best friends , brotherhood , and tattoos ! 
How can I be lost ? In remembrance I relive . And how can I blame you ? When it's me I can't forgive ? 
soooo booorrreeeedddd 
yay not bored anymore 
i got three hours of sleep last night . ugh 
been dazed and confused for long its not true ... 
i wants something to do ... 
but who watches the watchers ? 
just worked out , and now i feel like doing something tonight . amazing how going to the gym wakes you up 
is life hard , or do we make it hard ? 
beer is the adult's warm milk 
its friday and i have nothing to do . lame 
Dropped off the greatest friend a dude could have today for Army basic training . I'll miss ya brad :( But I know you will kick ass in the Army . Good luck bro 
I ain't dancing with your skeletons . I ain't dancing with what might have been .

i really wish the semester was over with already lol 
Hate me now /Trap all within my hands /Hurry up and hate me now /Kill all within my hands again

wishes he realized he couldn't be a reporter 2 months ago 
wishes he weren't home :( 
needed more sleeep 
wishes his weekend wasn't so dull 
wonders how so much can happen in five months , yet at the same time so little was accomplished 
hooray for cancelled classes ! 
everyday is groundhog day 
Just walk away and pretend none of this is real ... 
yay just applied to the university of north texas as an accounting < PROPMALE > ... 
And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts . And I looked , and behold a pale horse , and his name that sat on him was Death , and hell followed with him . 
a night that i may not remember ... 
fuck you clouds , ruined my DAY 
had the laziest day ever 
only in texas does it go from 75 degrees and cloudy to 90 degrees and < PROPFEMALE > in the span of a day . where was this yesterday ? 
what they don't know can't hurt you , but what you don't know can kill you 
body is tired but the mind is not ... 
thanks to the power of procrastination , i have to write a govt paper by tomorrow afternoon but i have to go to astro's opening day in 30 minutes and have classes starting at ten tomorrow . holy crap 
she holds my hand , and I lie to get a smile . she squeezes tighter , but I still lie to get a smile ... 
has had a hetic couple of days , and wants to get out tonight ! 
4 weeks of school left . fuck yea 
so i just separated my shoulder . 3rd time in 14 months . fuck me 
long drive +traffic+nagging pain in shoulder = not much fun 
so ... denton is not as nice as i thought it was going to be ... 
so many choices , so many decisions , so many variables , so little time 
my mind is going a mile a minute right now . I hate being an overthinker 
STRESS 
4 more weeks of school .... 
so i might have to get shoulder surgery to tighten up my left shoulder . ugh 
got out early cause of a test , so now i can chill at home for a couple of hours . yay 
wants to do something , but doesnt know what ... 
working out with bum shoulder = uncomfortable 
post workout down phase sucks 
is uber happy 
had the most awesome welcome home night ever lol 
chest congestion and working out do not work well together 
slash's new album = awesome 
why must my body fall apart 
life is full of surprises 
people are fucked up 
nothing like being right 
i feel like i have a 50 year old's body . keeps breaking ... 
why do i always go to bed late , knowing i will have to get up early ? 
so san < PROPMALE > and texas state are pretty awesome 
you know , after actually visiting actual universities , going back to community college is kinda depressing 
finally i go to a game where the astros win ! 
is excited for the future ! 
nothing like operating on one hour on sleep . makes everything woooossssshhhhh .... 
i have found out it is possible to operate with 4 hours of sleep over 2 days . hooray insomnia ! 
just got back from fishing with parents and < PROPMALE > . had fun , tho didnt catch one goddamn fish lol 
is burnnnned out . my quads are twitching 
hooray my govt class is cancelled 
how can you sleep 10 hours and still be tired ? feels like i slept 6 
needs something to do tonight ! 
hooray for putting off school work till the last minute , yet still feeling like you did good work 
just one more week of school ..... 
where the fuck did spring go ? 
astros suck . 
doesn't like boring saturdays 
filet mignon+baked potato = so full 
and so the last week of school begins ... 
wants to see iron man 2 
i wonder who came up with the idea to have to take all your classes tests at one time . a sociopath perhaps ... 
i eat finals for breakfast ... and sometimes a late night snack 
wish all finals weeks would be this easy 
just got blitzed on a reporting final . love it when teachers make their tests sound small and easy , then all of a sudden BAM its an hour and a half later and you don't know what the fuck happened 
I love it when teachers change up shit at the last minute . For example , making a project worth 250 points in the syallabus , then changing it to 450 points on the last day because he talks too much and couldn't get to everything that was supposed to be done , thus forcing him to made everything worth more . Fucking fantastic 
slept to 11 . i love summer 
is sooooooooooo excited :) 
has a hard time believing he will actually be moving out in in 2 weeks . and is super excited about it :) 
bored 
so much to do , yet so little time to do it in 
kinda wants to get out tonight 
reflexation is an interesting feeling . combo of happy and sad 
wishes he knew more reliable people 
being ignored is one of the more frustrating things to deal with 
tired . kinda stressed . boooooo ... 
i suck at boweling :( 
i loves me some shopping 
spending 1200 really wears you out 
yay for guy's nights ! 
the astros make babies cry with their crappiness 
sooooo tired of running errands all the time . only have 4 more days for preparations 
Babble , Babble , Bitch , Bitch/ \ 
\ 
Rebel , Rebel , Party , Party/\ 
Sex , sex , sex , don't forget the violence/ \ 
Blah , blah , blah/\ 
Got your lovey-dovey sad and lonely 
just had my first creepy facebook stalker today 
just two more days ... 
last night in the house . woot 
new apartment plus korn concert plus beer equals awesome 
I didn't know furniture people deliever at midnight . but now I know lol 
I really do not like apartment maintence people 
I miss internet :( 
yay i have internet again ! 
had some people over , it was fun . yay apartment life 
nothing like another carefree day of doing nothing 
in soviet russia , you don't climb tree , tree climbs you 
its so strange to think about where and who you were a year ago compared to what you are today . almost everything is completely different for me . theres some good in those differences , but there is also some really goddamned depressing things in there as well . seems like for everything i gained something was taken as well . life is strange 
its so nice to have people over whenever ya want and not have to stress or wonder about what your parents think about them 
mmmm steak 
i love it how the media tries to get < PROPFEMALE > riled up for the world cup , but in the end they fail everytime . 
saturdays should be more exciting 
two weeks later and i'm finally unpacking 
mondays can be more interesting than you think ... 
women 
i wonder if satan has set up his summer home in texas . its hot enough 
misses his super cold ac ... 
fucking lakers 
its amazing how quickly a place can get dirty 
time to partay 
Wake the sleeping giant/Wake the beast/Wake the sleeping dog/No , let him sleep

vodka man 
usa lost . so sad 
busy busy day 
if there's a state that could be diagnosed as being schitzo it would be texas . wonder if there's a pill for that ... 
gonna be a boring night :( 
lesnar is one bad ass motherfucker 
i think my couch has a spirit in it that requires that someone must pass out there every night . evil couch

Got accepted !!!! Yay !! 
wonders where his cat is 
Is sad , really tired , stressed and wishes the door wasn't left open 
loves studying forty minutes for a test then feeling like you made at worst a low A . 
i really hate it when you study so much the day before and the day of , then go blank when the test is in front of you 
i love < PROPFIRST > LaiBrooke Amara Whitten : * 
a cop walking into your place is not a very pleasant experience . fortunately , it was just because the cig butt bucket started to smoke outside . then a fire truck came . yay 
pray for my uncle . his kidney and liver is shutting down . doctors have given him a few days to live 
elections ! 
never fun using logical reasoning to do a test that didnt have what you studied for on it ... 
I love tests that you can study an hour beforehand and feel like you made a hundred
