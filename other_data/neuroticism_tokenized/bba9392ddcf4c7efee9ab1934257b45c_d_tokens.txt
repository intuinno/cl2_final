In the beginning , there was nothing but an idea . The idea was remembered . It then became conscious . Finally , it became a wish to create . So it came to pass that out of nothing came the power to live and to grow , even in emptiness ... -Polynesian's creation of the universe myth- 
I accept sadness , a tenderness of heart , for it is a wet stone to my spirit .

Every spiritual advance I've made was preceded by some sort of fall - it's almost a universal law that a fall of some kind precedes a < PROPMALE > shift . A fall can be an embarrassing event that reveals the exaggerated influence ego has been allowed to play in one's life . Other falls may involve an accident , a loss , an illness , a failed relationship , a serious addiction , a business failure a bankruptcy - < PROPMALE > Dyer

Revelation 18:4 , 5 
All of us have a thousand wishes . To be thinner , to be bigger , have more money , have a cool car , a day off , a new phone , to date the person of your dreams . A cancer patient only has one wish , to kick cancer's ass . I know that 97% of you won't post this as your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do . In honor of someone who died , or is fighting cancer , or even had cancer , post this for at least one hour . 
One day she'll take my hand and we won't say a word it may sound obscured ; we share a mind , 1 heart beat , we are from the same time ... and she will just hold me . We innerstand each others unspoken truth .. that she IS , and that IAM , and and together we are 1 . 
In the end , we will remember not the words of our enemies , but the silence of our friends . -- < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > Jr.
