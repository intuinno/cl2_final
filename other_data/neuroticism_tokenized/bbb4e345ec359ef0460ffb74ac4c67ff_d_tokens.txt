I am dying . Every day , with every breath I draw , I am closer to the end of my life . For we are born with a finite number of breaths , and each one I take edges the sunlight that is my life toward the inevitable dusk . 

5:29 am : In a moment of brilliance , I have finally managed to prove that the chromatic number of an n-dimensional hypercube is always equal to 2 , thus avoiding what I was beginning to think would inevitably be a failing grade on my homework due tomorrow which I now realize I should not have started at 3 am the night before the due-date . 
1 final down , 3 to go . I can do this ! 
2 finals down , 2 to go 
3 finals down , 1 to go 
last final tonight . Math here I come !

Practicing gymnastics on a vast , grassy field , under a < PROPFEMALE > sky and a refreshing breeze . Could this day possibly get any better ? 
' s computer is dying 
2:00 AM at Uris Library : the Simpletron virtual computer is successfully built . Team Alex/David/Weili awesomeness 
umbrellas are useless in Ithaca , you get drenched to the bone with or without them 
ripped the skin off a blister on his hand in gymnastics class . Got home , and got a papercut right on the soft , fleshy underskin . Neither being kicked in the nuts or giving birth could even top that kind of pain . 
women have a very peculiar way of campaigning for Breast Cancer Awareness month ...

Life's a game but it's not fair\ 
I break the rules so I don't care\ 
So I keep doin ' my own thing\ 
Walkin ' tall against the rain\ 
Victory's within the mile\ 
Almost there , don't give up now\ 
Only thing that's on my mind\

December 7th 2010 - last gymnastics class of the semester : backflips , I no longer fear you ! 
you know you're at < PROPMALE > when you're too tired to fall asleep 
Saw is officially the greatest movie franchise I've ever seen

just went super saiyan 
a goal without a deadline is just a dream 
R.I.P. < PROPFIRST > LaLanne . You will be missed :( 
just had 3 turkey patties , a platter of brown rice , and a stack of french toast piled with syrup . Gotta love Sundays 
< PROPFIRST > Frias is very lame for not taking gymnastics this semester , and < PROPFEMALE > Calabrese is very lame for enrolling in the 1:30 gymnastics class . 
Today some guy in my stats discussion group asked the < PROPFEMALE > if -5+1 = -4 ... 
Beautiful days fill you with an unparalleled sense of happiness 
I think everyone should know that < PROPMALE > McHardy told me that he is in fact secretly rooting for the Steelers 
woke up from an < PROPFEMALE > dream 
on a scale from 1 to me , she was a 9 
snowy adventures are a much funner alternative to going to class 
I don't know how many times I'm going to have to say this : protein powder is NOT a steroid ... 
gymnastics/tricking goal for this week : land my first jacknife 
successfully landed his first jacknife today ... sort of 
Happy Pi Day ! :D 
If women ruled the world there would be no wars . Just a bunch of jealous countries not talking to each other .
