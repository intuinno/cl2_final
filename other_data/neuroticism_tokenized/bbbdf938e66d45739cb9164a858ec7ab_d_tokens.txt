As you therefore have received Christ Jesus the Lord , continue to live your lives in him , rooted and built up in him and established in the faith , just as you were taught , abounding in thanksgiving . - Colossians 2:6 -7 
So , as those who have been chosen of God , holy and beloved , put on a heart of compassion , kindness , humility , gentleness , and < PROPFEMALE > ; bearing with one another , and forgiving each other , whoever has a complaint against anyone ; just as the Lord forgave you , so also should you . - Colossians 3:12 -13 
I will rejoice and be glad in Your lovingkindness , Because You have seen my affliction ; You have known the troubles of my soul , and You have not given me over into the hand of the enemy - Psalm 31:7 -8 
Bad day is bad 
Psalm 38:8 -15 
I will give thanks to the Lord with all my heart ; I will tell of all Your wonders . I will be glad and exult in You ; I will sing praise to Your name , O Most High . - Psalm 9:1 -2

I believe in Jesus Christ & have accepted him as my personal Savior . One of my dear family members suggested that a facebooker has challenged all believers to put this on their wall . In the Bible it says , if you deny me in front of your peers , I will deny you in front of my father , at the Gates of Heaven . Simple . If you love God & you aren't afraid to say it repost this !! 
Thank you < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > for directing me to Proverbs 8:17 - \I love those who love me ; And those who diligently seek me will find me . \"" 
Jesus loves me ! this I know , \ 
For the Bible tells me so . \

they are weak but He is strong .
