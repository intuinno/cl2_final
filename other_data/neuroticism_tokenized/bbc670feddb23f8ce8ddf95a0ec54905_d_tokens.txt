My younger brother : \Are you still on facebook or whatever you kids use these days ? \ " AHAHAHAHA "

Post-choir concert : Funniest . Moment . Ever . 
I love my stepdad ... in < PROPFEMALE>'s in Seattle , he let me go into the elevator and press all of the buttons , just like in Elf , so I did , INCLUDING the emergency telephone operator button . Had a hard time staying serious while that was going on , and THEN a lady came into the elevator , clearly miffed , but it was HILARIOUS !!!!! 
Off to ANOTHER birthday party for MEEEEE ! 
Sha-la-la-la-la-la my oh , my looks like the boy's too shy , ain't gonna kiss the girl , Sha-la-la-la-la-la ain't that sad , ain't it a shame , too bad , you gonna miss the girl 
Doodling on my tablet ... 
Blueberry lucky charms ... nom nom nom ... 
* sigh * I've STILL got four more people to shop for ... I know ! I'll bake something ! 
Day was as follows : First , I went to Benihana ( again ) and all of the chefs < PROPFIRST > to me and I got the pineapple dessert ( nom nom nom ) , THEN I went shopping and bought a few things ( new flats and a locket ) , THEN my dad surprised me by taking me to EL GAUCHO ( I had never been ) for Cherries Jubilee , THEN I made some truffles ( which I will finish up tomorrow morning ) , and somehow , I managed to get on facebook . 
Christmas !!!!!! 
Christmas < PROPFEMALE > , Two A.M , Heavy Snow , Is Falling Down And the Streets , Clothed in White , < PROPFEMALE > Songs that were < PROPFIRST > by candlelight . Seriously , at two o ' clock in the morning last night , I started to sing that song . 
Why does everyone but ME get snuggies for christmas ? 
Sherlock Holmes ... Best ... Movie ... Ever 
I missed the stairs , and ran into a wall instead . I feel so special . 
A box with my name on it came from Amazon .... WITH THE GLEE BOXED SET !!!!!!!!!! 
Brother + Funkytown + Dance moves that require lots of hip swinging = eyes burning . O_e 
No . I refuse to believe that school starts back up tomorrow . 
My gift is my song , And this one's for you , And you can tell everybody , that this is your song , It may be quite simple , But now that it's done , I hope you don't mind , I hope you don't mind , That I put down in words , how wonderful life is , now that you're in the world . 
How does she know you love her ? How does she know she's yours ? Well does he wear your favorite color just so he can match your eyes ? Dedicate a song with words meant just for you , ooh , he'll find his own way to tell you , with the little things you do , that's how you know , that's how you know he's your love . 
Overall , I've had one of probably the best school days of the year today ... 
:( ... my grandma's dog might not make it to the weekend ( I've grown up with her for my whole life ) 
Holy crap ... there's an < PROPFIRST > , and a < PROPMALE > on EITHER SIDES OF ONE OF MY FAMILIES ...

How do you measure a year in the life ? How about Love ? How about Love ? How about Love ? Measure in Love . 
Think of me , think of me fondly when we've said goodbye , remember me , once in a while , please promise me you'll try , when you find , that once again you long , to take your heart back and be free , if you ever find a moment , spare a thought for me . 
* Sigh * Not ... happy ... 
That baby scares the crap out of me ... 
I feel like I'm singing to a wall , because the words I shout mean nothing to you at all , and when I say that I love you , you turn your head , and I toss and turn in the night , wondering if there's someone else instead , but I need you , you complete me , you save me from the monster I can be , I need you , you complete me , just say yes , just this once , please . 
GEOMETRY !!!! 
Going to Izzy's house tonight , PHANTOM PHANS UNITE !!! ( yes , I know , I spelled \fans\ " wrong ) " 
I've been living with a shadow overhead , I've been sleeping with a cloud above my bed , I've been lonely for so long , trapped in the past , I just can't seem to move on ... All I want to do is find a way back into love , I can't make it through without a way back into love . 
Maquerade ! Paper faces on parade Masquerade ! Hide your face so the world will never find you Masquerade ! Every face a different shade Masquerade ! Look around , there's another mask behind you . 
All you need is love , All you need is love , All you need is love , love , love is all you need .

And music , your music it teases in my ear , I turn and it fades away and you're not here , let hope pass , let dreams pass let them die , without you what are they for ? I always feel no more than halfway real ' til I hear you sing once more .

Joy Ybarra Thesunsetwriter : DON'T DIE . Think about your friends ... what would they do if they knew you were dead ?

Well it looks like love , and it sounds like love , \ 
And it seems like love , and it feels like love ;\ 
And it walks like love , and it talks like love , \ 
And it runs like love , and it skips like love ;\ 
And it hurts like love , disappoints like love , \ 
Disappears like love , reappears like love . \ 
And it shouts like love and it sings like love\ 
So guess what , my friend , I think ? \

This has been probably the worst day of high school I've had this year . 
Tonight . Will . Be . Insane . But I'm so excited !!!! :D 
Should learn not to leave her facebook open on other peoples phones . ;D 
Is looking forward to tonight's intermission with the two children dancing , the nazi in the corner , the creepy boy just sitting there watching us , the nun in the chair , and , of course , the nun on the floor . The hot room just got hotter . 
Is going to \A Christmas Story\ " at the 5th Avenue theatre with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > !!!! I'm so excited !!!!! :D " 
I know it's not much but it's the best I can do ... \

“There are only 3 colors , 10 digits , and 7 notes ; its what we do with them that's important . ” ~ Ruth < PROPMALE > 
Ah , internet . What would I do on a sick day without you ? 
Just got one of the best Christmas presents ever . 
Does NOT want Sound of Music to end ! This has been the COOLEST three weekends I've had this year ! :( 
There's a void place in my stomach that nuns on the floor , polka with < PROPFIRST > Hebert and quadruple-timing jerkfaces ( < PROPMALE > Frost ) wikll never fill again . I MISS SOUND OF MUSICCCCCCCCCC . 
Christmas has never been so synonymous for \stressful\ " in my life ..... "

Christmas is like the energizer bunny : it just keeps going and going and going and going ... 
Was at Ace Hardware when a guy in a black knee-high trenchcoat and white pants with black shoes walks by ... the catch ? His hair also stood up on end and he had bone white skin . Uhm ... did < PROPFIRST > catch a bus from Forks ? Or is it just me ? 
A-ha let's make ! 
Chili Con Carne is not just a song in Jazz anymore . It's an obsession . 
I'm walking toasted you ! Lainey < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Reiter 
No , snow . Please go away . Can you come back , say , Thursday ? That would be good . Thank you . 
Is the MLK assembly still going to be tomorrow ? Does anyone know ?

Half days make me happy . So does < PROPFEMALE>'s , Sweet Hearts , bright orange flags , and walking in slow motion with Izzy < PROPFEMALE > Magrini , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Rees , < PROPFEMALE > Agamalian , < PROPFEMALE > Nash , and < PROPFEMALE > Reisdorf . 
Goodnight , goodnight , parting is such sweet sorrow , that I shall say goodnight , ' till it be morrow . 
The people at Bon Bon , Rooster Cafe , and the < PROPFEMALE > are probably VERY scared of < PROPMALE > Reiter , Lainey < PROPFIRST > , and Izzy < PROPFEMALE > Magrini ... and me ... possibly ... >.> ... 
Mind is thinking in polka ... one two three ... one two three ... 
So I wait with my eyes open wide at the skies ... 
Like , is , like , a like , blonde again ! Commence like , excessive like , uses of like , the word like . 
Is wishing that she could be 5 again with her cousin < PROPFEMALE > , have her perspective on the world ... that Jupiter is the biggest thing ever , and that lasers are the scariest things she can think of . 
Had an interesting day at T&C and the < PROPMALE > House . ' Twas fun ! 
Have you ever had one of those days where things just seem like they're all shattering in front of your face ? 
The slug bug duel is onnnn , Izzy < PROPFEMALE > Magrini and < PROPMALE > Reiter ... prepare to lose . 
My voice sounds like that of a dying duck's . 
Absolutely adores being sick ... not ... 
Doctor says I'm not contagious !!! Disneyland , HERE I COME !!! 
Omnomnomnom . I'm a palm tree in the wiiiind ! 
Feels like an insane tourist . 
Feels like an insane- OH MY GOSH THE MARCHING BAND IS FOLLOWING US . 
So much for happiest place on earth . 
Apparently when I got up this morning to find out that I had supposedly up at two in the morning eating cookies in the bathroom . 
Having a quad iced coffee at 9:00 pm was probably not the best dinner choice ...... 
To < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > Appleberry , and Lainey Lee : Thank you . You mean the world to me ! I love y'all . :) 
6 hour delay at the Kona airport , not picked for the last flight into Seattle from Portland , signs say we're staying the night in PDX ! Oh boy ... open road lies ahead ...
