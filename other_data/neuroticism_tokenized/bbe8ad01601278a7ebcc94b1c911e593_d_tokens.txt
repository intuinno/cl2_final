La-La-La ..... LINOLEUM ! 

Rusted Root is on my mind ..... and I tunes .... 
Looking over my pics ... I kinda wish I had better ones . XD ; That or pull out my bass and play some White Stripes or Three Days Grace . I need kickass bass lines right now . 
Happy turkey day ! We just learned that Shrek is apparently also a Broadyway musical ? 
I gotta admit , I hate being talked down to , especially by a peer . =| There are times I know I need it to get my head deflated , but HUH . 
Should probably start showing some progress for new costume ... AKA taking the pieces and making it into a victorian costume . OH BOI . 
hey just a reminder to everyone .... Hail to the < PROPMALE > ! < PROPMALE > would be 75 today . Let us not forget the other world .. All Hail to the Goblin < PROPMALE > ! < PROPFIRST > Bowie is 63 today . Also celebrating today is : < PROPFIRST > Baez , < PROPMALE > Matthews , and < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > and a few more I can't remember . There is some magical music stuff in the stars on this day . 
Now let's all go eat deep fried peanut butter and banana sandwiches , Dance-magic-dance , until we are all under the table and dreaming . If you want , you can wear your famous blue raincoat . 
Dang ! posted that backwards ! ahh well ... 
Eeck , alka-seltzer , but if it helps me get better before Ohayocon ... 
Ha ha ! No school today ~ Finally , because it's so COLD ... and not because of snow . Jeez . 
If six people going to Fort Hayes who were having a snowball fight and trudging through snow to get people catch pneumonia tomorrow , you'll know why . 
Another snow storm ? I hope our school system isn't as crazy as we were led to believe LAST week . 
I am officially omitting this week from my year . 
I have a pile of college fliers , and three of them are for all-girls schools . Goodness me . 
Hoping for that sun to come out tomorrow , but apparently it's gonna drizzle . Damn . 
I just survived my SATs and I buttonmashed my way through my friends list in a headache-induced haze . I'll figure out what I really did by tonight , methinks . 
Having one of those days where I'm either outside the groups and looking in .... or was it sitting in my own little bubble and looking at everyone else together ? One of those outside looking in things . 
Okay brain , I'd like to get out of this stupid slump now . Day's about over , yes ? 
Finding sleep hard to come by , but < PROPMALE > ideas much easier to do . Now to get them on paper . 
I forgot there's going to be school tomorrow ... and the fact that Spring Break and Anime Punch are fast approaching . I need to get my head back on straight . 
Staying until 1 AM at a con on Friday ? That's a good thing , yo . 
< PROPFEMALE > time for the weary . Heading off to AP for the last day in a few . Probably one of the first times I decided to hit up the con all 3 days and didn't mind doing so . =D 
Yay for Anime Punch . The photohunt begins this week ... as soon as I recover from the \con hangover\ " and my legs stop hurting . " 
I made it in one piece to < PROPFEMALE > ... got woken up at 5:30 thanks to Filly's cat getting in my face with his own face and butt . Oh felines . 
Would love it if plans would work the way expected for once in my life . However , actually doing the beginning of original plans is a START , I suppose . Life is apparently one big long drawn-out improv . 
I need to work on a few things . Such as planning ahead and keeping my immune system up by sleeping ... @_@ Stupid stupid sleep ripping my immunities a new one . 
I just realized I still have a pile of work sitting to be done for school this week . Aaand .... a lotta work . I can do this ? 
Blue October concert . A . MAZING . My ears are ringing and my voice is going in and out of being audible , you know it's a good concert . =D 
I feel like something's missing . I can't put my finger on what it is , and it keeps bringing me further down . 
.... dear god get me out of that app . @_@ Though I'm amused by someone being embarassed to be around me . Who answered that ? XD I'm not angry , lawl . 
Finding people I forgot were on Facebook , hoping to get through this week alive , aaand ... excited for the summer . Possibility of Colossalcon is NICE ... and 2D Animation for 2 weeks , YES . PLEASE . 
Haven't had the best of days today . Maybe things will look better with a pint of ice cream and some jalepeno cheetos ... and some bad cartoons and anime dubs to make fun of .... I know a great one now . Oh Saiyuki Reload Gunloooock ~ 
Can't ... stop ... sneezing ... allergies ... must ... die ... * sneezes * AUGH . 
I wasted 5 hours that was my entire morning for Round 2 . Let's hope that Round 2 was definitely better ... 
Ever get the need to do a vent/rant ? I got it , and I got it bad . @_@ 
Watermelon makes it very hard to type ... as does a full day with about three hours of sleep , ha ha . 
Got fake blood on Mom's white shirt and had my hair flat ironed ... I LOVE PERFORMING ! <3 
Have some straight-haired pics of someone who's usually a fluffball . 
I'm not going to sleep tonight . 
Never .... again ... Hey look , my writing sucks again ! 
Nurse , I need a checkup from the neck-up , I'm BATTY ~ 
Attacking my hair tonight with a new flat iron we bought at Walgreens ... lets see if 30 bucks ... or was it 25 ... really is put to good use . 
Who knew that one person could bring down my mood so much , just by simply talking to me ? Damn , I wish my messengers came with blocks , I can't stand to see her anymore . 
My digestive system needs some srs condemnation . This is just getting ridiculous . 
Two more days . Just two more days . 
Augh god . I come home from having a good time and every website I lurk on ( save for one or two ) I'm walled by AAAANGST . Why on my good moods ? I'll never know . 
CRAWWWWWWWWWWWLING IIIIIIN MAH SKEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENZ ~ Oh Linkin Park , you amuse me . 
Feeling empty and alone in a crowd . But then again , who DOESN'T feel alone and empty in a crowd ? \ 
To be filled with some sort of joy sooner or later . 
Because whenever I check it and see that whiney post ... eck . Changing it . NOW . 
Just posting pics of the rather interesting night out with the old fol- I mean parental units . And dancing to 70s and 80s music ( mostly 80s , as Steph wound up recognizing almost all the songs ) . 
Having knowledge that I made it all the way to senior year is giving me senioritis already . D= 
Mom's going insane over her new Bravada down in Florida and having a set of malfunctioning Buble tickets ... she CANNOT blame me for any more grey hairs she'll find . 
Kuroshitsuji II - That new kid in Ciel's place is INSANE . I kinda liked bitchy boy better ... plus he had an eyepatch . D= Maaaan ... 
Finishing packing for OSU when my iPod decides to wipe its songs and the fact it's name is Aziraphale . * sigh * Well , time to refill the library . Again . =_= 
Why am I checking facebook at writing camp ? Because I'm cool like that |D That or I'm easily distracted by pretty web icons . \ 
PRETTY . 
Skipping lunch to work on writing . I wonder if that's a good plan or a bad one . 
Getting re-addicted to Robot Unicorn Attack . I need that song on my iPod , even if it bothers me . 
Dad said I'd hear him at 5:30 in the damn morning , and he did with some rant consisting of ... god I don't remember , I was half-asleep , how the hell am I supposed to listen to everything I did wrong ? = T 
So this one time at Writing Camp I ... \ 
[ finish this sentence . ] 
Cracktastic dream was cracktastic . However I don't remember the \founding fathers\ " being able to play jazz or having done so at my writing camp . " 
So on getting only 3 hours of sleep , if even that I try to take a nap ... and wind up in more terrifying spiraling nightmares . Just what I need . 
Greatest way to wake up for a trip to Chicago - Dad yelling at you about maturity if you forgot to turn off your overhead light when you fell asleep . :| \ 
All other things that he claims I'm mature for went down the drain because of that . Gotta love it . 
Skype dominos . Cruelest thing to play EVER . > 8C 
I want to get a laptop and I wanna go somewhere that's NOT here . e-e 
It's a trap . 
Inception = Mind Rape . But it was amazing mind rape . Need I say more ? \ 
And I almost blew 60 bucks at BNN to buy the complete series of Powerpuff Girls . \ 
Nostalgia , you are such a devil . Glad < PROPFEMALE > and her dad were there to be like \Lets gooo ! \"" 
Not everything that happens to my body is self-induced . I wish I knew what the hell made me stay awake until 4:30 AM trying not to heave into a trashcan . 
So let me get this straight . All the sites I need to check messages for are NOT allowed to be seen or they need flash plugins that I can't install on these computers , my application document is blown to bits by random coding , aaaand the only messenger I have access to is MSN . \ 
Goddammit . = A = 
Too many blackberries . Can you say bumpercrop .... \ 
Anybody want me to give them some Maine Blackberries ? =D 
I got blisters on my fingers ... literally . This is what happens when you have played at least 5 hours of bass for the past two days , and you haven't played bass in ages . 8| 
First day of senior year , 3 AP classes , and BOTH Chemistry and Physics . \ 
Though Ensemble , Computer Graphics and Italian 4 bring me joy . 
I say close the school until you can get ALL the AC units working or until it's truly fall . 
Hey , January . Hurry < PROPFEMALE > arse up so I can have some fun and spend some time with peeps I hardly ever see . <3 
Dear god , Robot Unicorn Attack is on Facebook ... now I will never stop playing it . Or singing it ... 
Either be excited or bitchy about Ohayocon . Make up your mind , mind . =/ 
The meteorologist in me is having a field day and trying to hope for a tornado sighting . \ 
The paranoid me is wanting to run down to the basement and hide from the storm . \ 
The normal teen me is wanting some dinner . 
Getting WAAAY too stressed with WAAAY too much for < PROPMALE > work ... especially now that I know I have to make a portfolio by THIS THURSDAY . \ 
Can I have a mental day please ? 
< PROPFEMALE > the Vampire Slayer leads into Repo : The Genetic Opera . Best trail of thought ever . \ 
BTW - THE REPO MAN'S REAL NAME IS GILES ! 
It's freaky when you're working on The Laramie Project and the big news topic lately is gay suicide . It's rather ... disconcerting . 
If only if only I had some time to actually focus on my OWN personal wants .. I have to wait on that until I get my college apps in . Damn you , senior year . You deprive me of everything except workstuffs . :| 
Whatever happened to quizzes asking PERMISSION TO BE POSTED . Crimony . 
Cannot watch Pocahontas anymore . I cannot ... \ 
Lirin we are totally writing that fanfic . Right now . XD 
And we've figured out why religion is usually a \forbidden\ " topic . Especially when they all start to lose their heads . \ 
Whatever You O Meter is ... it needs to die . :| Or at least stop magically posting up things I know I haven't done . 
Who needs to act when people don't care about plot ? \ 
Who needs to sing when people don't care about sound ? \ 
Who needs to write when people don't care to read ? \ 
Who needs to draw when people don't care to look ? \ 
What a world we live in , where things are as simple as CGI special effects , autotune , texting and self-taken photos making a \: *\" face from overhead are where our standards are . " 
So weeaboos are to people OBSESSED with Japanese culture . \ 
How do we go about naming \weeaboos\ " of other cultures ? \ 
Rehearsals are DONE . Now all we got left are the performances ... and the teasers . But I can live with that . \ 
I miss coming home between 3 and 4 . 
My subconscious likes to reprimand me about the people I want to be the closest to , I let them become the furthest . \ 
Burn , dreams . Burn . 
The realization that I no longer have to stay after school for the purpose of rehersing Laramie Project is ... wow ... we're done . We're done with the show . \ 
And < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Head in \trannnie\ " mode for < PROPMALE > Horror Picture Show is amazing . This man's voice is very yes . " 
Why do parents hafta be so stupid sometimes over the littlest things ? :| 
Creative constipation . With a dead forum , a partner in crime I can't comprehend much of anymore , and just lack of overall interest ... I've run into a dead end . \ 
Laramie did something really good for me . I didn't have time to actually THINK about this stuff . :| This is a failure . 
Even though I'm missing Formal , I don't feel like I'm missing anything at all . 
Ohayocon : Who's attending , raise your hand ! Or ... like the status or somethin ' . I dunno XP 
I've been nodding off all day during class , and I'm getting a really icky feeling in my throat ... please I don't wanna come down with anything right now . :\\ 
Three essays and a resume ... no . Just no . :| 
I can't watch the last two episodes of Wolf's Rain . I just can't . 8C\ 
\ 
Where's my ice cream ? 
I learned a lesson today : DON'T READ THE HOT ZONE . 8C 
I don't know how I feel about the new < PROPMALE > Potter movie . \ 
I do know I feel like \FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF\ " when I realize I'm spending over 6 hours at < PROPMALE > Post today . " 
Brb head exploding . 
I'm amused by the fact that most everyone I see on here had Thanksgiving DINNER ... and I had me a Thanksgiving LUNCH . : ' D 
< PROPMALE > thanks for all the birthday wishes ! :D I was not expecting as many as I have gotten . XD ; 
We have to make this mooment last ... FOREVER . 
I got my mural design done in the < PROPMALE > of time . HA HA . Now onto the next shmillion < PROPMALE > projects . 
So Saiyuki Reload manga is STILL in bookstores . At least I now got me 6 and 7 to go with that 9 . Crimony . @A @ 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas to all ! :D 
Getting a new freakin ' tablet today ... and some books . :D Booyah . And working on costumes , hopefully . \ 
Again , booyah . 
Scheduled for my first in-car tomorrow morning ! \ 
< PROPMALE > , beware ! 
So apparently instead of getting a Ciel wig , I may wind up lopping off my hair , straightening it , and then coloring it . \ 
... huh . \ 
I still intend to get a wig though . 
This day has completely drained me of any intelligence and creativity . And internet is being super laggy , which makes me feel like I'm transferring my fatigue to the connection or something . \ 
Well , off to play Oblivion . 
Driving class has been moved to Saturday , among the ... the many plans I have for that day . D: \ 
Son of a ... 
Oh , so it forced me to take the new profile . \ 
But I don't want to . :| \ 
Oh well , at least it was a CHOICE before they stuck it on , unlike DA's updates , hurrhurr . 
All I want right now is a scanner that actually works and won't vivisect my < PROPMALE > AND ACTUALLY FUNCTIONS ON A STUPID VISTA . > 8|\ 
Pieces o crap . 
Oh hi , right side of my face . I haven't felt you since before 2 . Where've ya been ? 
YES . FINALLY . NO SCHOOL . BOO . FRICKIN ' . YAH . 
You know , a gas leak would explain all the funny smells coming from the different buildings . Though that could just be the bathrooms and the student body itself . XP\ 
Damn ... well , c'est la vie . No school ... again . 
Huzzah , the schedule for Ohayocon is up .... now to print and highlight just WTF I'm doing there |D 
Who knew Columbia's acceptance letter came in such a pretty package ? \ 
But I DID IT . MY FIRST ACCEPTANCE LETTER ! 
Getting everything together and finished ... then I realize I think I just screwed up on my wig . Like bad . D: 
My mom and I are the goddesses of waiting until the day to finish up a costume . : T 
Stranded at < PROPMALE > Post ... well , not really STRANDED , as mom and < PROPFEMALE > are afoot ... but we aren't going anywhere yet . D: \ 
I wanna get back for some more madness , maaaaan . 
Another con come and gone . 
Note to Self : If I want to truly want to stay long nights at a con without having to go home , get my own damn hotel room , have the key , and have it ABOVE the convention center . :\\ 
This tagging picture business is not fun . > C * misclicks ahoy * Sorry to people if I clicked some wrong name ... 
What better time to get sick than when you have snow days ? Ugh , colds . > A < 
Scholarship applications . Government packets . Am I missing something ? \ 
... yeah I am . Crapdapple . 
Frig life right now . I can barely even fit into ONE requirement for scholarships at best . :| Any hope for financial aid seems to be blown out of the god-blessed water . 
Oh god PLEASE don't let my Gettysburg trip be on the same weekend as Anime Punch . That will royally screw up a LOT . 
Government paper makes me write in gibberish . :| 
I actually got off my < PROPFEMALE > and got the card out of the camera with the Ohayocon pics ... the few that I got . :P \ 
So who wants ' em ? 
I think I need to set up at some point this year where I just take two weeks off a computer in general . @_@ 
Hey guys , let's get some FROSTBITE with those assignments . 
Plans for Valentines Day : Draw character couples and gorge on < PROPFEMALE > . Sounds like a pretty sweet deal to me this year . :D 
Fffuuuuuuuuuu Filly I will take your < PROPMALE > desktop for 100 bucks , I will take you up on that offer . \ 
Stupid computer , crapping out on me . Stupid Vista . 
I just sold my soul for 25 bucks . ;D 
The benefits of Valentines Day : Free < PROPFEMALE > . :3 I think that's all I've eaten today too ... heh heh whoops . 
Jacked mom's iPod touch . It's very hard to type on a touch screen . 
I just got an email from Hopkins . Apparently I am missing my test scores and my application fee . \ 
I SENT IT ALL IN A BIG ORANGE ENVELOPE , I KNOW WE HAD THE CHECK IN THERE , GUYS . > 8C FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-\ 
First CCAD is turned in by the SKIN of my teeth , now this .... Should I start looking for grey hairs ? 
So CCAD now has everything of mine , Johns Hopkins is still waiting on my test scores , BUT the payment's in ( and reimbursing the second payment ) .... \ 
Now to just sit on my hands and start seeing which colleges say yay or nay . O-O ; 
Silent Hill 2 . \ 
I can has it . \ 
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee ! 
AP Government and scholarships , oh my . \ 
Colleges , why can't you send acceptance/rejection letters faster . D: 
YAARGH SKITTERS SHUT UP I GET IT I'M NOT ZOMBIE ENOUGH TO VISIT YOU , GEEZ . > 8C 
< PROPFEMALE > . Fricken . Haw . e-e 
OH YEAH ! \ 
I GOT INTO CCAD ! 8D 
\We're awesome . Scene is awesome . You're not . :] \ " \ 
I am about to smack a bitch . |D This is just PROVING my dislike and disgust towards scene kids . 
Hey guys ! Half of my face is completely dead ! Speech is impossible without chomping unknowingly onto my cheek or my tongue . \ 
Yaaaaaay for using paper and pantomime to get my points across . 
Silent Hill : Downpour . \ 
The one thing I know I am sad about this game is that Akira Yamaoka is not working on the music for it , and that man is a god for making the Silent Hill music . \ 
Still looks uber creepy . May give ' er a < PROPMALE > , yet . 
As much as I dislike political involvement ... I'm in . For my teacher friends , my teachers , and all the other state-workers . \ 
Uneasy territory , here we go ! 
Borrowing my sister's image to play with new profile pic . I think my < PROPMALE > Post/Ohayocon shot was getting ... old . XP 
Feels like some small part of me is crumbling away . Three simple questions to the feeling though - What ? Where ? Why ? \ 
... I swear I'm not feeling emo , I'm actually in a good mood . D: 
Homework , such a pain ... why is it mandatory again ? 
Anime Punch ... so who's going ? :D 
Three colleges say yay . \ 
Two colleges abstain ... courteously . \ 
At least the three I have I got a pretty broad spectrum of choices , woo hoo . 
Cosplay Laser Tag . \ 
Who else wants to do this ? 
I think this week I'm going into school and starting a donation pool for money or supplies to go to Japan . I'm tired of seeing people saying that they want to help but can't or fretting about anime , I think there are some more pressing concerns than that , as the situation there is only going to get worse . \ 
Time to help out , folks . 
At noon , it's school time for me . For now , I get to hog the computer for the morning and stay in my pajamas for hours . :D I wish every day was like this . 
Finally sees why the second series got bumped up to mature . Eeeeeh . I feel terrible for watching it now . 
It's a beautiful St. Patties day . :D Happy birthday grandma , happy anniversary to the parents ... and yay I can actually have a good excuse to wear all green today . 
PS3 ~ I FINALLY HAS ONE . 
So I've been here for a grand total of three hours , I'm ready to come home ... alas . \ 
I have a feeling I may be here until six p.m , unless lady luck's on my side . \ 
Oh < PROPMALE > Post , robbing at LEAST six hours of my weekend from me . At least there is Dr Pepper . 
Holy ... \ 
I just realized there's only one more quarter before it's time to kiss high school goodbye . \ 
I dunno whether to be happy , sad , or scared . 
Good news : I am getting my computer back tomorrow . \ 
Bad news : The harddrive went bad , so everything . is . gone . ;-; 
I think tomorrow I'll just be keeping my mouth shut . I've made enough < PROPMALE > blunders today . 
Are you there kiddo ? This is mom stuck at airport ........ 
Has it been34 mins already ? 
Oh poop ! Only 9 people on my plane and said it may be delayed another hour due to the storms that passed throuh here earlier . 
Darn darn darn ..... maybe let us on the plane and hit the minibar .... ya think ? 
Hey they are talking about boarding ...... let'sgo! 
Hooray , reinstalling EVERYTHING from before the hard drive crash ... too bad I got no music or photoshop right now ... well , it'll return . Someday . \ 
And I got my first rejection letter , but bummed I am not . :3 I'm still excited about where I CAN go . 
My cat has a serious wish to see me suffer , he tried to sleep on the right side of my face . 
Excellent , I have been accepted to three , denied by two . So , I'm almost dead sure where I'm going now . Excellent , excellent , excelleeeent . 
No dressing up as a pirate and getting paid for it until next week . Damn . D: \ 
Next Saturday is going to be a living hell ... the entire coming week is going to be a living hell . 
Now entering : The Week From Hell . Enjoy your stay ~
