looking back , i changed so much in 2009 ..... i wonder what 2010 will bring . 

-City Of Blinds- I live in a city of blinds , I wake up from life , To fall asleep in light , Can't open my blinds to the blind . A blind man walks his blind dog , To the left , the right , Just enough to sense the light , And feel the warmth . Even flowers , plotted in soil , Take in the light and live . The blind man ignores the day . He is immortal . Death a surprise . 
cool gardens is the most thought provoking book i've ever read . if you ever get the < PROPMALE > , read it . 
i havent drank monster for two weeks now .......... 
i cant get over how awesome Cool Gardens is . 
-Friik- What's my problem , Here's my problem , My problem is that im Too visual to be blind , Too audiological to be deaf , Too idealogical to be in peace , Too compassionate to be in war , Too crazy to be sane , Too sane to be lazy , Too emotional to be you . serj tankian is a genius . 
3.86 GPA for 4th quarter . thats the highest ive ever gotten

a chicken walked in front of my bus this afternoon ... 
chick-fil-a is the best

12 hours of sleep ... today will be a good day 
chick-fil-a

good day+chik-fil-a = best day of the week 
shot < PROPMALE > :) 
i feel like today could have been better , even if it is a monday . 
im never playing farmville so stop sending me invites . 
today went from good , to bad , to worse , then back to good again . i hope it stays that way . 
Tras'kleya'thallgryaa ..... iakthe'landra'klaa . 
Tras'kleyaa'thallgryaa'iakthe'landraa'klaa ..... that has been stuck in my head for a while and i cant forget it . 
the < PROPMALE > lady who saved 10000 children during WWII should have gotten the < PROPMALE > Peace Prize , not Obama . all he did was give us more debt . 
System of a Down was , in my opinion , the best band to ever exist . RIP , SOAD . 
biology foldables are fun ....... not . 
finished bio foldable .... now for my government speech . this is gonna be a long day .... 
airsoft with < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > 
\you can't dodge the bullet of fear that seeks our heart . \"" 
PSATs ..... great 
12 hours of sleep makes me happy :) 
\Lust for power is the master disease of our time . This force alone devours the weak and rules the strongest . \"" 
is going to talk in third person tomorrow 
the fourth kind looks sick . cant wait to see it . 
cant wait for the new serj tankian album . wish i knew what day it was coming out . 
monster fell out of my jacket ( in my car ) before i got on the bus . i hated it . i was tired all of 1st period . 
today has been really good so far . hopefully it will only get better . 
cant wait for tomorrow 
got birthday punches from 4 people at once . kinda weak , though . sorry Raheed KhanSumit Rajpara , Enobong Nta , and < PROPMALE > Riseberg . maybe you'll do better next year . 
i think today was possibly one of the best days of my life :) 
starting to see things again ...... great . 
going to get new iPod :) 
going to get new ipod :) 
new iPod :) 
appeal to reason is a really good cd 
weekendd 
why does everything seem to fall apart right after its been put back together ? one of the greatest mysteries of our time . 
today has turned out to be exceptionally good 
is sad and slightly confused 
today is a boring day 
monster almost made me sick yesterday ..... why must it betray me like that ? 
rise against and system of a down are the greatest bands to ever exist . no one can deny it , cause they know its true . 
just got primer in my eye . it hurt . 
i hate today . nothing good happened . 
im sitting on books . why ? because they were in my chair and i didnt feel like moving them . 
them crooked vultures is the best new alt rock band this year , and they should be recognized for it 
thinks he died for 1 second last night , then came back to life . no lie . 
i cant wait to see our society fall apart . we deserve it , and its coming soon . 
i took a video of me trying to push < PROPFIRST > Everlasting < PROPFIRST > out of his seat in the bus , but i failed miserably . you ruined everything , < PROPFIRST > . you just haaaad to stay in your seat . 
im dying . 
i have blood on my hands ..... 
haha i forgot i have to eat lunch 
i think i was just called by a demon or someone possesed by one . it was weird . 
just got one of the best ideas for a painting/ink drawing . my day just got so much greater . 
action and reaction . this is the stuff that our society is esentially made of when you get down to the basic mechanics of life , no matter how you look at it . 
i did NOT have enough caffine today . 
halfway done with ms klotz's project . anyone know the placement and function of a centriole ? 
i am not afraid to keep on living . i am not afraid to walk this world alone . 
sometimes the hardest thing to do is let someone go because you know they'll be happier elsewhere . 
no monster tomorrow :( im gonna be soooooo grumpy . 
once its too late , you'll realize your fault . you trusted me too soon , after ripping out my beating heart . 
why must we hurt others ? what is in our hearts that causes this ? its all a viscious never-ending cycle that will consume us all in the end . theres no fighting it , because we cant grasp it . all we can do is wait around for it to come to us , and i feel like that could happen any time now ..... may our world soon deceased never rest in peace . 
feels like he was unintentionally a jerk 
today is a good day 
WILL BE COMPLETELY HONEST FOR 24 HOURS ... ask me something ( only in my inbox ) . Any question , no matter how crazy , sinister , or wrong it is , i will answer no matter what . you have my FULL honesty , but i dare you to put this as your status and see what questions you get 
Quote of the day : \I'm not wearing any pants . \ " - < PROPFIRST > Everlasting < PROPFIRST > " 
she makes me happy . a different kind of happiness compared to normal . and its a happiness that i never want to lose . 
being a pessimist is great . either youre always right , or pleasantly surprised . 
that teacher thinks she can tell me and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Masters to throw away our drinks . she has no right to do that , and im 90% sure that is against one of the bills of rights , and if it is , she would have commited a federal crime if we had listened to her . but we didnt . So i guess it would only be considered an attempt . but she would still get in trouble . and thats good . because she deserves trouble . 
my ears have been ringing for 4 minutes ! its tortureee ! 
Quote of the Day : \I'm going to guitar center tomorrow to purchase a pillow . \ " - Raheed Khan " 
today is a happy day . 
you cant dodge the bullet of fear that seeks our heart . but i can . 
< PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > made me think system of a down was was back from their hiatus . never do that ; it makes me hyper-active and excited . but at least i saw a unicorn eating snow . and < PROPMALE > had a blue purple , but didnt realize it . kids these days ..... 
homework is done . finally . 
im a fake-jew . why ? i dont really know . 
i feel like my life is a book . and im at the end , but so much more could happen , but i'll never know for sure if it will . one of the weirdest feelings in the world . 
everything just went away . everything . i have no ambitions or dreams anymore and dont know why . looks like i have to clear my path once again . great ..... 
something's changed .... and i dont like it . 
i give up . i cant do this anymore . 
i feel like i have nothing , but i have everything i could ever want . i feel so empty , like a city after the bomb drops . and the people are gone , yet the sun is still there . i feel so imcomplete as i sit in this seat , thinking of my inevitable defeat , and begin to weep . i feel loke i have nothing , but i have everything i could ever want . 
found one of the best places to play airsoft . 
people amuse me . when you deny them what they want , they inevitably feel the need to resort to violence at one point or another . that shows just how far we have sunk as a society . 
Happy Christmahannukwanzicah ! 
< PROPFIRST > lost Chicken . 
my dad said i could paint abstract < PROPMALE > all over my walls in the summer . that makes me so incredibly happy . 
GOOOOOOJIIIIIIIIRAAAAAA 
dont feel like myself 
i realize what i need now . and it makes me sick . 
it is , in the end , whatever the hell i want it to be . and when im through with it , its gonna blow a hole , this wide , straight through the world's own idea of itself . they're throwing bottles at your house . come on , lets go break their arms . 
< PROPFIRST > lost chicken , so i \lost\ " play-doh . we're even now . " 
Quote of the Day : \That tree has herpes . \ " - < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Masters " 
why does my dad argue with me and make me mad ? because he thinks its fun . my day was fine until he came home . 
this day started good , and is now ending badly . hopefully it will be good in the end . 
401 Kill 
i wont go down without a fight . and if i fall , i sure as hell wont be forgotten . 
so booorrred right now . 
is in a good mood right now . 
playing airsoft in 2 feet of snow wasnt my greatest idea .... 
i dont think you trust in my self-righteous suicide . i cry when angels deserve to die . 
Mother Nature is mad at us . We tear down her children , and let her world rust . We debase her trees which give us air . Our machines rip ‘em from the ground , without the slightest care . 
im so confused even though i shouldnt be . its almost like i dont believe myself . strangest feeling in the world .... 
i dont think i can keep waiting for you . sometimes dreams just dont come true . 
tral'seyaa'nai'klaa'vor'ahn . 
no one saved us . no one's gonna save us . where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall ? where do you expect them to go when the bombs fall ? WHERE DO YOU EXPECT US TO GO WHEN THE BOMBS FALL ?!?! -Tentative ; System of a Down ( RIP ) 
i feel like it must be said again . tral'seyaa'nai'klaa'vor'ahn . 
we are the fear of death . 
did the easiest exorcism ever last night . 
Tell me what im supposed to do , with all these leftover feelings of you . ' Cause i dont know . And tell me how im supposed to feel , when all these nightmare become real . ' Cause i dont know . 
I'm standing on the rooftop , ready to fall . I think im at the edge now , but i could be wrong . 
my eye hurts like crazy . maybe its from when i got a piece of plastic between my eye and tearduct . 
Take everything off your shelves and throw it on the ground , where it wont be found by our society . im getting sick of this world . cant wait to leave . 
All because of you , I haven't slept in so long . And when I do I dream of drowning in the ocean . Longing for the shore where i can lay my head down . I'll follow your voice , all you have to do is shout it out . 
We are the angry and the desperate , the hungry and the cold . We are the ones who kept quiet , and always did what we were told . But we've been sweating while you slept so calm , in the safety of your home . We've been pulling out the nails that hold up everything you've known . Dont hold me up now , i can stand my own ground . I dont need your help now , you will let me down , down , down . 
i personally dont care about the new year . its not really a new year because it wasnt naturally established so there isnt really such a physical thing as a year . we made it all up . so whos to say that it even exists ? its just another way to pace ourselves , and an aspect of our pointless philosophy of time . 
this is not how i was hoping to end the year ... :( 
Death Energy makes you so happy no matter how depressed you are before ... 
in fb chat :\ 
< PROPMALE > Casanova : \Hey 
i can hear the angels singing , i hear them call my name ~ ~ 
monster x-presso is pretty good 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Masters is my bestest friend ever . 
Its disparaging and demotivating to see an isolated consumption addicted society not realize the potency of its silence to its well self-guarded establishments . People , its your dollars that pay for the bombs that are killing our chances for survival in the years to maybe not come . 
i think im gonna forget my old life and start over again . it would probably be for the best . 
i think im on the edge , ready to fall . and really , i dont even care at all . 
today is a very good day . 
Tra'sar'nai'ka , sah'rann'la'haiyaa . 
i hate not listening to rise against . 
robbery in the neighborhood . for their sake i hope they dont try my house . if they do , they'll be met with large amounts of gunfire . 
lets look to the wind to dry our tears . 
airsoft was fun . even though my shotgun snapped in half . 
people make me laugh . especially when i say something they cant deny , then they realize they're wrong , THEN get mad , just because they didnt get their way . yeah , thats a mature thing to do . i find it incredibly amusing . 
\I hate the cold ! It's awfum ! \ " \ " Um ... What's awfum ? \ " hahaha < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Masters that made my day . " 
today is better than average . thats surprising , considering its a monday .

our world is so fake . 
ive come up with an extremely complex theory that makes sense . hooray . 
listening to All That Remains , The Fall of Ideals . again . 
i feel betrayed . 
today has been a fairly decent day . if only i found the hobo .... 
i see myself inside you , you dream the dreams that i do . 
im really hoping today will be a good one . 
airsoft was fun today . 
like the angel you are , you left creating a lightness in my chest . 
today was a good day . 
i feel like today is a good day . 
Our Goddess gave birth to your God .

standing no < PROPMALE > to win , but we're not running , we're not running . 
cant wait till tomorrow . nothing bad can come off it . either i get to turn in my govt notebook late and still get every point for it , or i get a teacher fired . 
one of these days the sky is gonna break and everything will escape , and i will know . one of these days the mountains are gonna fall into the sea , and they will know . 
what if we all die young ? 
chairs thrown and tables toppled , hands armed with broken bottles . standing no < PROPMALE > to win , but , we're not running , we're not running . 
today was boring , but this week was great . 
never drink applesauce , orange juice , and hot sauce all at once . 
why should i conform to a world no better than me ? 
i find it irritaing how people make rediculous assumptions about how depression works and what causes it and how you feel . they know nothing . 
i hope we still have school tomorrow . i'd rather go now than in the middle of summer . 
Quote of the Day : \Why do i have four balls ?! \ " - < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Masters "

i should probably get my homework out of the way ...... oh well . 
I still dont get the point , whats worth destroying all the world ? 
just shoveled 3 driveways ........ i am exausted ...... 
if you need an exorcist talk to me . i can help , but it wont be cheap . 
i do not want to see snow for another 5 years . i hate it soooo much . there Kelechi < PROPFIRST > Obineche , i said it . I HATE SNOW . are you happy ? 
i walked into a door on friday , and forgot about it until now . hooooraaayyy for forgetfulness . 
pants on the ground is now on itunes 
can barely see through my left eye 
no school for the rest of the week . thanks for ruining my plans , snow . 
the next time you hear someone complain about our generation , remind them who raised it . that should shut them up for a while . 
stupid people do stupid things , smart people outsmart each other , then themselves , then themselves . then themselves , then themselves . 
this snow is making me go insane ....... 
my heart's in a state of hibernation , waiting to be awoken by you . 
time to work on my english outline .....

Quote of the Day : \Why do you have a whale on your hand ? \ " - < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > \ " In what way is this a whale ?! \ " - < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Masters " 
Why does life fall apart right when things are starting to go great ? i really hope im just oblivious to the real , hopefully better , situation .

Ghetto potatoes !

praise the lord and pass the ammunition 
if you see me please just walk on by . forget my name , and i'll forget it too . 
i dont know what to do now . great ... 
i did not like today . 
like the angel you are , you left creating a lightness in my chest . why ? because you took my heart with you . 
if love is wrong , go ahead and end the world with your charades . never wrong , constantly dreaming of another way . 
love , loss , like a bullet's path , tear through the cavity in my chest . 
just finished the main body of ms dulany's research paper . all thats left is adding more examples and quotes ..... i really hate this paper . >:(

Quote of the Day : \It's like a poop slide ! \ " - < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Masters " 
time to finish the research paper rough draft ..... 
i am a mortal man , but im not falling , im not broken yet . i am a mortal man , but i hold tight to my beliefs now . 
i see you through the snowblind , but i wasnt there for you 
angels show up in the strangest of places 
You'll never fall if you stand for something . 
drink applejuice . ' cause OJ will kill you . 
So if you love me let me go , and run away before i know . My heart is just too dark to care , i can't destroy what isn't there . Deliver me into my fate , if i'm alone i cannot hate . 
finished the research paper .... I AM SO GLAD I AM DONE WITH IT !!! 
it'll take the death of hope to let you go . 
I never claimed to be a saint . 
dont feel like myself . 
seeing things in a really wierd way ... 
a rainbow threw up on me today . 
today's bus ride was .... interesting ..... ( < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Masters , @ < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > , < PROPMALE > Duffy ) 
If love is wrong , go ahead and end the world with your charades . 
I wants to get a machette with a 18.5 inch long blade . :D 
every word ever written will fall short of its intent . even < PROPFIRST > or spoke or screamed , they will betray what they have meant . 
. it took the death of hope to let you go . 
It's like i can't stop what i'm hearing within , it's like the face inside is right beneath my skin . 
finished homework ... now i can finally relax 
the day i learn to fly , im never coming down . 
must find the herpes tree so that me and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Masters can put glitter on it . 
somebody get me through this nightmare , i cant control myself 
and still i wait , with a hole inside of me . 
let the anger consume me . 
needs to decide what to do . 
i'll never forget all the tears . 
lets contemplate humanity . 
song of the day : It Dwells In Me by All That Remains 
well , when you go , dont ever think i'll try to make you stay . and maybe when you get back , i'll be off to find another way . 
i cant get rid of this pain , it passes right through my soul , let the madness consume me , so i wont remember you anymore . 
this is toooo much . 
Sar'kaii'lo'taa . 
this is not your place . no , this is not your playground , it's my heart . 
I think fate is laughing at me . 
even the people who never frown eventually break down . 
i think i might just give up . that seems like the easiest solution at the moment . 
airsoftt soon 
going to on the run with < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > was ...... interesting .... 
today is a great day 
i wish i was free of this , i see her in my dreams , wish that she wasnt there . but she still haunts me and i still feel her breath on me , still want to taste her skin , but i know that would kill me . no , damn her , still i choke on her lies , still reeling from her last caress , her goodbye . 
wants to have a reaaaally big airsoft game over the weekend . 
getting a haircut ..... hopefully it wont turn out like < PROPMALE > WonYeob < PROPFIRST>'s .... 
im really starting to hate this english project ....

Quote of the Day : \Eat the satchel !! \ " - < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Masters " 
so sit across the table , feed me some lies . 
they'd like to see me fall , but i'm already on my back , so it goes in one ear and right out the other , people talkin ' shit , they can kiss the back of my hand . 
going to on the run causes so many stories that beg to be told ..... 
since when was it 7:37 ?!?!?!??! 
My heart pounds to The same rhythm as The knife you’re stabbing Into my soul , Ripping and tearing Until there’s nothing left But bloodmeat and the Emptyness that can Never go away . 
There's beauty in destruction , a resurection , another < PROPMALE > . 
finally back in < PROPFEMALE > 
i wanna visit pancake island so i can go to the fun volcano that errupts every five seconds , then go to lake tripanakawa . after that , im gonna go to gurlfran island and climb the gurlfran tree . just gotta watch out for those poisonous spiders XD ( < PROPFIRST > Bishop , < PROPFEMALE > A < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > Nunn ) 
how could i fail to understand ? cities are burning , the trees are dying , my heart awake , but still , pain is killing me , pain is killing me . 
simply because you can breathe doesnt mean youre alive , or that you really live . 
what is in us that turns a deaf ear to the cries of human suffering ? 
the year of the black rainbow is so close :D :D :D

i am aware of the velociraptor 
dont shake , i hate to see you tremble , trembling . you've lost your touch , haven't you ? im so addicted , so addicted ..... 
tomorrow's TWLOHA dayy 
if i had a gun , i'd pump your ethics full of lead , if i believed in meat , i'd eat a plateful of our dead . 
this will be the death of us , my friend . 
irritated and slightly depressed . this is not fun . 
chillin to Set Your Goals and airsoft later . today should be a good day 
i kinda want the cuts on my arm to turn into scars ( < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Masters ) 
can you see me through bloodshot eyes ? should i fight for what is right , or let it die ? think about that . 
i cant believe ms dulany actually managed to get the students to teach class for gradess 
shouting words at a mirror , trying to find the hero . i dont wanna let any of you down . 
my dog just mauled a rabbit 
humanity sits on its throne , cover your eyes and ears and nose , we cant escape the consequence . 
turning that < PROPFEMALE > in an old book miss-read , an old book miss-read . 
i lose myself in anguish for tonight , help me get over you . one last false apology , help me get over you . in my mind , blood drips from your eyes , a beautiful last goodbye . 
i feel like things are starting to get normal for the first time in a long time . finally ... 
apparently ( according to caffienefiend.com ) it would take drinking 72.94 cans of monster to kill me . i know for a fact that ive had more than that , so ive reached the conclusion that i am imortal . 
Tra'sar'nai'ka . Sah'rann'la'haiyaa . Maah'sar'kaii'lo'taa . 
Mar'na'saoo'kii'sahn . 
i'd rather kill a stupid flower , and spread its seeds around , until a garden with our bullet-laden morals will be found . 
the heart reveals what smiles betray , your sad , sad eyes gave you away . 
the sacrifice is never knowing why i never walked away , why i blame myself this way . now i see , your testing me pushes me away . 
toe is numb and half of my nail is gone . fun stuff . 
so are we breaking out , or breaking down ? we can't blame this world forever , this world forever . 
this week has been good so far ... aside from some slight pain .... lets hope things stay good 
cant even ask you why , and now im wasting away in my own misery 
so borreddd . 
everything will be okay in the end . if it's not okay , then it's not the end . 
Quote of the Day : \(sarcastic voice ) woooow 
i haaaate this govt hsa review . 
no one else will fight , no one else will fight , so i must . 
really wanna get a machette . the one im looking at has a 18.5 inch blade :D :D :D \ 
just gotta make a sheath for it 
i can be only this 
no pants day is tomorrowww 
tell me why my iron eyes tell the tale , heroes always pay in their blood , i can be only this . 
well part of my day tomorrow was just screwed over . how fun . 
had fun with Katlin < PROPFEMALE > Clemons today ;) 
we are the fallen and the dead weather are both coming out with new albums tuesday . that will be such a great day . 
dont let this win over you 
im hating all of this govt . homework . does ms < PROPFEMALE > hate us ? wait , what kind of question is that ? of course she does . 
and when i'm gone , will you forget me ? will you forget ? 
i think im just possibly obsessed with Alesana . just possibly .... 
the dead weatherrrr 
dont ever talk to me like you think you know me or what i've been through , i am nothing like you . 
finally finished the govt hsa review . 
may i never lose my youth , and if i do may i be forgetable . 
its better to know yes or no , than wonder if it was worth the wait . 
looking back in the past and reminiscing on those horrible days .... today shall be a day of remembrance . 
i had to fall to lose it all , but in the end , it doesnt even matter . 
how would you describe me in one word or less ? 
posting the govt hsa review in a minute . i love making people wait for these simply because i can .... 
tell everyone in the world that im you , take this promise to the end of you . 
i hate feeling like this , im so tired of trying to fight this , im asleep and all i dream of is waking to you . tell me that you will listen , youre touch is what im missing . and the more i hide i realise , im slowly losing you . 
listening to SOAD's Toxicity album .... possibly the best cd ever made . 
i should probably do the bio hsa vocab .... too bad i dont want to . 
dont know where my bio hsa room is .... this should be interesting 
i dont like today .... too depressing 
there is no heart without you 
im kinda liking today 
< PROPMALE > the Jewish Orange ( < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Masters , < PROPFEMALE > Nunn , Connor Meehan , < PROPFEMALE > Holt ) 
i dont see nothing but pain and misery cause you are the one for me , why cant it all be true ? can i escape with my blue fallen reverie ? when can it all be true , why cant it all be true ?? 
saw the coolest car ever with Katlin < PROPFEMALE > Clemons 
spiders by system of a down- my current favorite song 
you , you went beyond , and you lost it all , why did you go there ? 
my new pool was installed today :D 
i cant believe i fell for such a blackened heart . 
today is a really good day 
had fun spending pretty much the whole day with Katlin < PROPFEMALE > Clemons :) 
even though you cant afford , the sky is over . even though we cant afford , the sky is over . i dont wanna see you go , the sky is over 
you gave my emptyness a name , then you ran away 
i have found all that shimmers in this world is sure to fade away again 
my pot pocket ! lmao ( Katlin < PROPFEMALE > Clemons , < PROPFEMALE > McNeil ) 
dont tell me where i will lay in your cemetary , dont try to silence and burry me , dont push me ' cause i wont go quietly , i'd rather die with dignity . 
maybe some day i'll be just like you and step on people like you do 
finally finished my guitar final . such a joke . 
i am the eyes inside staring back at you . 
each day will bring us brand new scars 
soooo tired 
:/ 
i spend my days tangled in thoughts of you 
next time i get a big < PROPMALE > im gonna ask them to put it in a chicken nugget box instead of wrapping it up so i can trick my mind into thinking im eating something \healthy \"." 
and if i never have you , then i can never lose you 
i have no more blood to bleed , cause my heart has been draining into the sea ~ ~ 
today is pretty good ( Kelechi < PROPFIRST > Obineche , < PROPMALE > Casanova ) 
do you hear us ? we are rotting . 
the falling ground screams goodbye . 
when enough is enough , thats how you know that youre halfway there . 
i feel your heart against mine , so take a breath and close your eyes 
i long for the moment our silence is broken 
Quote of the Day : \What is that human sacrifice music youre listening to 
Kaa'nak'sii'laoo'rahn'ta . Na'sar'kaii'lo'taa , tra'sar'nai'ka , sah'rann'la'haiyaa . Suhr'tann'kao'la'mahn'kai'saa . 
me , < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > , and < PROPFEMALE > McNeil ended up spending $51.99 on energy drinks and < PROPFEMALE > . the guy asked if we were having a party . we said no , this is our biweekly re-stock . they stared at us like we were insane , and i cant say that i blame them . 
Quote of the Day : \We're on the last act ! \ " - < PROPFEMALE > Nunn \ 
silent my voice , ive got no choice , all the world i see before me passing by 
so disturbed 
hes growing fat , growing fat on the throne , where he's sat like a stone , a man who's never known no hunger , shown no mercy 
under this sky no longer blue , we bring a < PROPFEMALE > long over due . 
really liking Chains & Shackles by < PROPMALE > Oliveri 
If you like this status , I will post something on your wall I like about you . 
sometimes you gotta get dirty with the people spreading the dirt .... so here we go ~ ~ 
oh , the bitter irony ... 
i can hear my heart break at new places surrounding old stitches 
on the run with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > was fun . especially the part where i made cars stop for us at cross walks and laughed at them too 
new addition to my bucket list : have a picnik in the middle of the street . 
if you brave , copy and paste this to your status and see what people rates you :( 1)crazy(2)I'd marry you(3)talkative ( 4)sarcastic ( 5)loveable(6)clubhead(7)moody ( 8)dumb(9)spoiled ( 10)mouthy ( 11)random ( 12)hot(13)funny(14)smart ass(15)amazing ( 16)retarded ( 17)cute ( 18)rude ( 19)simple ...

this blood has long since dried 
Quote of the Day : \ ... and like how am i supposed to add color ? its an ancient theater not a rainbow\ " - < PROPFEMALE > Nunn \ 
i wanna sleep in tomorroww D: 
feel oddly weird , and not in the normal way :/ 
the risk is worth the gain , its worth the sacrifice 
everybody likes beef jerky ( < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > ) 
the memory now is like the picture was then , once the paper's crumpled up it cant be perfect agian 
the static of this cruel world causes some birds to fly long before theyve seen their day 
i tear on the leash that keeps me contained and controlled . let me go , i want to break free and fight my way out of this hole . one last hope to rise and break away , above the fading line way beyond the ties that bind . 
hanging out with < PROPFEMALE > Nunn today :D 
does anyone dare justify how we're living ? does anyone here care at all ? 
low men in yellow coats is an amazing book 
we are the disillusioned . 
been really liking mushroomhead recently 
ramenn :D 
pokeballs poop lava every four seconds ( < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Masters ) 
You think you have broken us down , you have not 
can a song replace a broken heart ? can a song replace a broken love ? no . \ 
really starting to like a static lullaby 
the past is to remind me how broken i am , how naive i was . ive suffered the consequences , this world is not for me ~ ~ 
went on a fun adventure todayy with < PROPFEMALE > Nunn :D 
kinda sorta really psyched for warped tour 
feel like dying right about now 
a word too soft to be spoken , wrapped in barbed wire . im traveling amongst the charred fields of snow , i have become nothing 
\The definition of the functions tied to people's necks choke the true essence of the identity . \ " -Serj Tankian " 
im calm like a bomb ... 
black engulfs the dying light , as he falls on frail wings of vanity and wax 
this war is ours 
lost my faith , but dont you cry , i got a hole inside , and its 10 < PROPMALE > wide 
like my status and i'll tell you what i \ 
like/dislike about you ; my first impression of you and a confession . 
warped tour needs to come a little faster . im tired of waiting 
bombing your ignorance , we're feeding your insolence . far away , we're going too far , we're going too far 
saw Predators with < PROPMALE > Casanova . it was kinda sorta really good . 
im a fake-jew again 
all these things i hate revolve around me ~ ~ 
cant wait to see Bring Me the Horizon , Suicide Silence , Breathe < PROPFEMALE > , Set Your Goals , Four Year Strong , The Rocket Summer , The Pretty Reckless , Alesana , Haste the Day , iwrestledabearonce , Attack Attack !, Sum 41 , Of Mice and Men , Eyes Set to Kill , and the other bands at Warped Tour with Katlin < PROPFEMALE > Clemons and hopefully < PROPFEMALE > Nunn and < PROPFEMALE > Holt if i can find themm 
This battered room I've seen before \ 
The broken bones they heal no more , \ 
With my last breath I'm choking \ 
Will this ever end I'm hoping ; \ 
My world is over one more time 
You force-feed us lies , \ 
One by one . \ 
Our eyes go blind , \ 
As we stare at your sun . 
cant wait for warped tour tomorrow :D 
warped tour was amazingg :D really tired though ... ( Katlin < PROPFEMALE > Clemons , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Clutts , < PROPFEMALE > Nunn , < PROPFEMALE > Tertitsa , < PROPFEMALE > Naylor , Gaby < PROPMALE > ) 
my ipod is finally full .... i knew i shouldve gotten a bigger capacity 
glad i got the Atticus V cd at warped tour . well worth the $5 
Negative and violent , we're all so important . 
We Came As Romans 
everyone is all the same . everyone you know . 
Quote of the Yesterday :\ 
Me- \Hi id like to use this coupon for 3 free french toast sticks . \ " \ 
got the coolest backpack everr today :D Katlin < PROPFEMALE > Clemons knows she's jealous 
Get Scared is a good band

like this and i'll tell you a secret hehehe ... 
you know you havent been on facebook in a while when you come back to 81 notifications 
is finally back homee :D 
we dont wanna believe that the world can still move on , we dont wanna believe that the sun can still shine on 
going to on the run is always fun . thats even more so true when you go with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Masters and < PROPMALE > . that was quite interesting lol 
Undone Upheaval is an alternative screamcore band that is looking for a second guitarist , a bassist , and drummer . If you think you've got what it takes , let us know . Contact me , < PROPMALE > Casanova , or < PROPFIRST > Wall via messages . We'll get back to you as soon as we can . 
< PROPFEMALE > apparently the chicken came first , not the egg . no joke . apparently someone did some kind of study on it ( it was in the news ) . its because the egg cant be made without a chemical that comes from the chicken . so there . question answered . 
did you know that 1800 children die from malnutrition and hunger every hour ? how fucked up is that ? 
back from Katlin < PROPFEMALE > Clemons's house :) i got to meet some real-live canadians hahaha 
you would be the corpse , and i would be the killer ; i would be the devil , and you would be the sinner ; you would be the drugs , and i would be the dealer ; everything you say is like music to my ears 
dont mind us were just spillin our guts , if this is love i dont wanna be loved 
girl , you've got me shaking from the way you're talking , my heart is breaking but there's no use crying 
gotta mow my yard :\\ 
so .... 
i will be the razor baby , i will be the pill , i am the ambulence that never comes , the antidote you spill . and in the accident ill be the failure in your breaks , i am the truth you couldnt take . i am the mistake , the worst you ever made ~ ~ 
Kaa'nak'sii'laoo'rahn'ta . 
back from hanging out with Katlin < PROPFEMALE > Clemons and < PROPMALE > . completely made my day :) 
if you could see like me , you'd see you haven't won anything . if you could see like me , you'd see your precious light is fading , your light is fading ... 
i think i have a problem ... im addicted to chick-fil-a sauce ( Katlin < PROPFEMALE > Clemons ) 
the sharpest lives are the deadliest to lead . 
so this friday the 13th wasnt too bad . on a side note , i think im gonna get myself some guages soon :D

i need your love like a boy needs his mothers side ~ ~ 
youre the strength i need to fight , youre the reason i still try , im the moth and youre the light , use these wings so i can fly . 
Undone Upheaval is looking for a second guitarist . contact me or the other members if you are/know one . 
back from arundel mills with Katlin < PROPFEMALE > Clemons :) 
tears dont fall , they crash around me . 
im walking down the line that divides me somewhere in my mind , on the borderline of the edge and where i walk alone ~ ~ 
ive come to find that the greatest sadness comes from pure loneliness 
so today wasnt all that bad 
dont you see ? im the narrator and this is just the prologue ~ ~ 
misery is so beautiful 
Undone Upheaval is finally complete . 
Love is not when you feel only pain 
though id die to know you love me , im all alone ~ ~ \ 
\ 
gotta love evenescence 
you burried me alive , and everybody's gotta breathe somehow 
thank you BGE for digging in my yard on the day i was gonna mow . now i have nothing to do . 
if i sleep just to dream of you , ill wake without you there ~ ~ 
love , loss , like a bullet's path , tear through the cavity in my chest ~ ~ 
today has been too boring 
we dont dissapear just because your eyes are shut 
itd please me greatly to punch one specific person in the face . multiple times . oh yes , that would be so satisfying . 
we sow seeds to see us through , cause sometimes dreams just dont come true , we wait to reap what we are due 
what will it take for us to know this is not a test , to know this is cardiac arrest of a world to proud to admit our mistakes , we're crashing into the ground as we all fall from grace . 
i have an illness , and it's called myself 
Fill the void of angst with whatever pieces fit 
Now is the time to believe in yourself . \ 
Have no fear how others think of you or will judge you , \ 
Because your greatness will silence them all . 
such a good day . not gonna tag anyone . probably too many people anyway . you know who you are :D 
Inside , inside your head your wasting away , \ 
Away right in front of my eyes . \ 
So get lifted , \ 
Dependent on this artificial feeling ~ ~ 
your remainder is an unjustifiable , egotistical power struggle at the expense of the american dream , of the american dream , of the american ~ ~ 
wow ... school ? tomorrow ? i refuse to believe it ... 
goodbye summer ... 
is it just me or is the first day of school always slightly depressing ? 
you kinda have to wonder : why do we praise people who went against society in the past and made huge changes , but shun those who attempt to do it in the present ? sometimes humanity just confuses me 
you really shouldnt lie to people . they might do something crazy like believe you . who wouldve thought that ? obviously not you . 
I close my eyes and you are everything I see . Goodbye ~ ~ 
in my mind , blood drips from your eyes ; a beautiful last goodbye 
< cue the symphony of hearts ripping asunder > 
you gave me a life , now show me how to live ~ ~ 
Katlin < PROPFEMALE > Clemons :) 
i sold my soul to the open road 
i can officially say that i absolutely hate homework with a passion . 
The double rainbow guy is gonna be on tosh . 0 next week :D 
pahaha you need to walk in on costume day dressed as a clown , visit klotz , < PROPMALE > , and titford , and be like \GUESS WHAT ?! I MADE IT !!!! \ " \ 
you cant buy sincerity 
so i just looked down at my hand and theres blood all over one of my fingers . how lovely ... 
i watch the clouds rolling , its happening again ~ ~ 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Masters :) \ 
oh , and < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > and Tj Smith . cant forget you guys :D 
live , \ 
love , \ 
let go ~ ~ 
dont turn your back on me , i wont be ignored ~ ~ 
I've been so jaded , \ 
Forget the past . \ 
It wasn't meant to be this way , \ 
I need to fight this on my own . 
you wanted the world , i'll burry you there ~ ~ 
tie this arround your neck 
mixer was fun tonight . tomorrow should be good too . im really liking this weekend 
9/11 ; we will never forget those who did us wrong and those who died because of it . RIP victims , you will be greatly missed ~ ~ 
to sum up this week :\ 
\what word sounds like Qualitative ? \ " \ " wallet ! \ " -special < PROPMALE > bio class i overheard\ 
this chem hw is taking FOREVER 
Undone Upheaval is complete . again . lets keep it that way . 
getting one of my toe nails fixed soon . fun stuff ...

i think its safe to say that Linkin Park has officially died 
tomorrow's To Write Love On Her Arms Day :) 
might drop out of chem gt . this next test will decide for me . 
i want to take control , but i know better ~ ~ 
finally got songs chosen for the ahs fall coffeehouse ! :D 
so apparently even the principal doesnt know when the fall coffeehouse will be . how incredibly helpful ... 
seeing everyones true face makes me wish they would keep their masks on ~ ~ 
what is this life void of love ? \ 
its not a life at all . \ 
except it is . 
i try to make it through my life in my way , theres you . i try to make it through these lies , thats all i do .

Her body teases me\ 
As the sun reveals the < PROPFEMALE > . 
I'm going crazy without you , \ 
It's hard to believe but I'm having fun .

and you know what ? i like it . 
is finally starting to get his voice back from yesterday 
death can take me if i cant be free , i'm not like you , i'm a dying breed . 
all i wanted was your honesty , something more than this , something more than this ~ ~ 
so im not really into pop music ... but grenade by < PROPMALE > mars is actually pretty good 
my angel lie to me and tell me i'm dreaming ; please wake me up , please wake me ~ ~ 
so apparently im taking my school picture again tomorrow ? stupid mackechnie and his inability to remember which day is ours ... 
i can feel these changes right before my eyes , i see a dying fire inside your eyes , inside your eyes 
We stare at broken clocks , the hands don't turn anymore . \ 
The days turn into nights , empty hearts and empty places . \ 
The day you lost him , I slowly lost you too ;\ 
For when he died , he took a part of you . 
last band practice before auditions tomorrow . hopefully itll be a productive one ... 
is this what we pictured the night that we said youre the one ? 
i think Undone Upheaval is ready for the coffeehouse auditions 
working on computer edits on some of my < PROPMALE > . theyll be up on monday :D 
just when you think you know what youre gonna do , life turns upside down and laughs in your face 
coffeehouse auditions at 4 
new bring me the horizon cd = epicness 
i take back every word i ever said to you ~ ~ 
Truth is .... like this and I will complete the sentence 
i wish you could see you were the only girl i ever dreamed of . are you satisfied ? 
Everything I touch turns to stone . \ 
So wrap your arms around me , and leave me on my own ~ ~

naa'saii'ko'lanaal'oos . drah'eii'nah'te'gahh . kiio'ha'naai ... 
And I fall for her like snow from the sky 
not happy at alll 
this face is deceitful when it smiles , \ 
it doesn't show how desperate i am inside . \ 
so come with me and we'll go , \ 
believe in me and i'll show you who i am . \ 
so you can see the man behind the monster that i am . 
and it hurts in the worst way now that youre gone , its so wrong , so wrong ~ ~ 
Closed eyes still look forward . 
so much homework ... 
Chiodos is such a good band

i am the ocean , i am the sea . there is a world inside of me . 
finishing my < PROPMALE > project and listening to asking < PROPFEMALE > . todays gonna be pretty chill . until i st < PROPMALE > my english journal ...

NEW ESCAPE THE FATE ALBUM !! lets see how it is 
i dont wanna be demanding , i just wanna know the reason why we live and die in a world of lies ~ ~ 
new escape the fate album is pretty good . its different , but it didn't disappoint . 
Toxicity . oh , the nostalgic memories that album brings back . every time , every single one . 
i know it's hurting you , but it's killing me . 
looks like i wont be going on tour anymore . oh well . always next time . 
sometimes i think i'll die alone 
cant wait to make an EP . cant wait for the RHHStival . cant wait for all of the upcoming metalfests . cant wait for my life to be changed . 
oh , how we celebrate the mediocrity 
hoping for the best ... 
underoath's new album . not bad from what ive heard 
if your stomach feels weak , then my work here is done . 
card games on motorcycles ?!?! 
you wont be leaving my arms ever , i promise you that . even if you want me to let go < PROPFEMALE > , even if you want me to let go ~ ~ 
if i never met you , i wouldnt like you . if i didnt like you , i wouldnt love you . if i didnt love you , i wouldnt miss you . \ 
but i did , i do , and i will . 
had fun talking to < PROPFEMALE > Patino for most of the day :) 
cant go see BMTH at the white marsh hot topic tomorrow D: 
I keep my scars from prying eyes\ 
Incapable of ever knowing why\ 
Somebody breathe I've got to have an answer\ 
Why am I so fascinated by\ 
Bigger pictures , better things\ 
But I don't care what you think\ 
You'll never understand me\ 
What the hell did I do to deserve all of this ? 
I WILL BE HONEST FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS . You can Ask me ONE question ( ONLY IN MY INBOX ) I will anwser no matter what . You have my full honesty , but i dare you to put this as your status and see what questions are asked you ? 
keep your hopes up high and your head down low 
mall soon with < PROPFEMALE > Patino and < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , then band practice . today will be a good day :) 
The world seems different watched through vengeful eyes .

so blown ... cant go to grace tonight cause im contagious ... but my band Undone Upheaval will still be there , so go that way you can check them out :) 
is hoping his band will get main stage at the RHHStival in january . i have a good feeling about this :) \ 
especially since were ranked #19 locally ( MD , < PROPFEMALE > , VA ) , and especially considering that there are signed bands like Korn in the the same list :DD 
working on stuff for my bands next cd already . we just keep hitting the ground running :) 
misses < PROPFEMALE > Patino so much <3 
the nightmare before christmas :) 
still i see you standing there , waiting around for me to fall 
one amazing month with < PROPFEMALE > Patino :) im so lucky to have her <3 
looking forward to 2011 . gonna be recording a full-length cd ( already got the name/cover/half of the lyrics ) , gonna be playing lots of gigs ( maybe even warped ) , and gonna be moving up the charts even more ( currently #14 in 3-4 state area ) . so for those who have ever said i would fail , and have waited to watch me fall : just look at me now , and know im living the dream and you arent . so whos laughing now ? not you :) 
got a feeling in my stomach and it just wont quit 
LET'S SEE WHO PAYS ATTENTION ... You and I wake up in a jail cell together . \

i still wish you the best of luck baby , and dont go thinking that this was a waste of time , i couldnt forget you if i tried 
didnt make it into RHHStival ???? whattttt ??? bullll . shittt . stupid genre bias ... 
a withered past and a blurry future . my hearts on an auction , it goes out to the highest bid ~ 
so much homework 
finished my clown painting today :D 
me and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Masters need to stop matching 
i try to make it through my life , in my way there's you . i try to make through these lies , that's all i do . 
if you follow through with what you say youre gonna do , im gonna beat you so fucking hard that youre gonna be in a hospital for 3 straight months . you better watch your back . 
to be honest .... ( like ) 
my next < PROPMALE > project ? self-portrait of me as a zombie . id say thats a win :D 
i was once , possibly , maybe , perhaps a cowboy < PROPMALE > . 
sometimes i want to show you the world through my eyes , so you can see whos real , whos fake , which paths to take , and where they will lead 
you better hope i dont see you fucking face at school tomorrow

you see my pain is real , watch my world dissolve , and pretend that none of us see the fall . as i turned to sand , you took me by the hand and declared that love prevails over all ~ 
we're already dead , we're already dead , we're already ....

recorded an acoustic demo , and got through The Aftermath a few times . i think its safe to say today was productive

sometimes strength can only come out of desperation , and success after failure . \ 
and i think its about time to succeed . 
even a liar can be scared into telling the truth , same as an honest man can be tortured into telling a lie 
bite your tongue , just bite your tongue , you've already said quite enough . 
today was pretty productive . tiring , but productive .
