I'm waiting to pick < PROPFEMALE > up from Volleyball try outs . I hope she makes the team . I think I'm more nervous than she is !!! 
< PROPFEMALE > made the Volleyball Team !!! 
it's getting too darn expensive to send these kids off to school . Physicals alone cost over $300 for the three of them !! Crazy ! 
< PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > are off to school , < PROPFEMALE>'s teacher will be here today for a home visit ... which means I should probably clean up a little .... anyone out there do windows ? 
Parent open house at Westview this afternoon ...... I hope they don't want any money ! I'm just about tapped out after this week !!! LOL

I'll be opening up the fair at the Hardin County Player's Booth tomorrow . Can't wait ! 
< PROPFEMALE > won a fish at the fair yesterday ... it died today . So since she spent nearly $30 for supplies I guess we'll have to buy her another fish . 
I'm freezing !! Days like this make me miss Alabama ! 
Who wants to play ? Lets see how honest FB friends are .... Leave a one-word comment that you think best describes me . It can be only one word . No More . Then copy & paste this on your wall so that I may leave a word about you 
Ok , so I pay $100 per month so < PROPFEMALE > can go to preschool , that's $900 a year , right ? Well they are saying that that amount of money is not covering supply costs so now I have to pay another $40 for those !!! Somebody is really mismanaging money in our school system !! 
I really should be doing something productive with my time ... 
Eighth grade and seventh grade volleyball teams both won !!!

Put this as your status if you're against bullying 
Heavenly Father , walk through my house and take away all my worries , troubles and any illnesses . And please protect and watch over and heal my family and friends in Jesus ' name . Amen ..........
