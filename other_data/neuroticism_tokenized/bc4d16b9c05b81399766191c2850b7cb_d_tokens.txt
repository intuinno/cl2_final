Avatar . Great . Frickin . Movie . 

Ok , so the phonebook in my phone is lookin ' a little out of date . Some random people just got wished a happy new year with good luck , much love , and a large quantity of Skittles :-p Happy New Year everyone ! 
It's after 5 on a Sunday and it's painfully boring at my house . Is anyone doing anything right now ? I'm in - even if it's chasing elephants with a slingshot - I'm that bored right now lol !! 
Training for the Warrior Dash starts now . http://www.warriordash.com 
Happy Mother's Day everybody !!!!! 
is wondering how someone can go have a cigarette then go to the gym ...? 
Rampage had the W in his hands at round 3 and threw it away . What a disappointment ... 
You know you have an extreme workout routine when people at the gym stop working out to watch you ... :D 
Happy Father's Day everybody !!! 
Is it a bad thing that I caught myself growling instead of breathing while I was lifting weights ? 
Anyone have foursquare ? I just downloaded it to my crackberry and I'm trying it out ... 
some dude just tried to sell me some random bedsheets in Jersey < PROPFIRST>'s - WTF !?! 
All of a sudden I feel a little used ... 
I really want a BMW now ... 
http://www.thefitgamer.com - check it out - spread the word 
Before you return a phone , it'd probably be a good idea to erase all of the sex apps you downloaded ... FAIL 
If I were in North < PROPFEMALE > , I'd be in shcool ... http://news.yahoo.com/s/yblog_upshot/20100811/od_yblog_upshot/behold-americas-educational-system-captured-in-a-single-photograph 
I hate meatheads .... 
The thermometer in my car says its 106 degrees out - isn't that the starting temperature of low-heat ovens ? 
To everyone that called me today , I'm really sorry for not picking up . I left my phone home on accident , and my work apparently believes in 12-hour work shifts . 
Halo : Reach - 15 minutes left :) 
Oh how I love being the sober one when I go out hehe ... 
Apparently I take such a small number of vacations , my mom asked me if I was fired since I was home so much lol 
Leopard pants + pink camo top = Bad idea 
Work was crazy bananas ; now it's time for some bananas weight lifting :) 
I can't help but note the irony in driving past a cop that was on his cell phone while driving ... 
Anyone down for a late night showing of Paranormal Activity 2 ? 
The Last Dragon is on BET right now - a serious throwback :) 
just saw two middle-aged men in a BMW Z4 with the top down blasting what sounded like Whip My Hair by < PROPFEMALE > Smith ... wtf ? 
I just paid my car off today :D yiiiiipppppiiiieeeee !!!!!! 
Can't frickin ' stop playing with my new BlackBerry Style ! Seriously , I've had my CrackBerry moments but this is bad even for me ! :p 
Seriously considering a late night jog at the gym .... and maybe Jackass 3D . 
Just left work . Making muscles next + COD : Black Ops @ midnight = life of a fit gamer :) 
3 minutes to Black Ops ... 
Got it !!!! Time to get grimey !!! 
Holy crap I gamed so hard I have a headache :-P 
Rampage FTW ! 
Now that all the food I ate is settling , I can wish everyone a happy thanksgiving ... and work myself stupid at the gym tomorrow :-p 
I'm thinking ' that I might go see Faster tonight . Any takers ? 
Got Castlevania : Symphony of the Night free by buying the new Castlevania : Lords of Shadow www.konami.com/castlevania 
Muscle making then possibly bowling tonight ... 
I really want cookies right now and I don't know why ... 
Change your FB profile picture to a cartoon from \ 
your childhood . The goal ? To not see a human face on FB till Monday , \ 
December 6th . Join the fight against child abuse , copy & paste to \ 
your status and invite your friends to do the same ... 
I'm seriously lost with this whole < PROPFIRST > thing :-p 
there's a subway in the 24-hour super walmart next to my gym and it's open - WIN :D 
Has anyone ever felt dumber after talking to someone ? Yeah , just had one of THOSE customers ... 
Once again , GSP is da man ! 
Just left the holiday party for my work and for our secret < PROPFEMALE > exchange I got a massive box of skittles . I think there's gonna be an all-nighter in my immediate future :-p 
It's past 3am and I'm still hopped up on Skittles . Not really sure what to think at the moment , yet I'm oddly imagining unicorns for some unknown reason ... 
Watching throwback Christmas cartoons on ABC Family and working on my website . It's oddly making me feel like a kid again :) 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone ! If you didn't get an email from me then I don't have your email address - so hurry up and send it to me ! :) 
I'm gonna shamelessly promote my website now , cause it's 5AM and I can hehe ... \

I need to deal with more annoying customers at work ; every time I do I beat a personal best at the gym ... :) 
Someone just walked into the store pushing a stroller carrying 2 dogs ... wtf ? 
You know you're up too early when you slam your usual energy drink and you're still tired . I need a Red Bull , lol . 
I'm freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee ! no work tomorrow ! yay ! Now it's time to make muscles . 
I have just learned that hanging windshield wipers ( an ab exercise ) are god-awfully effective . I officially want to kick the editors of Muscle and Fitness magazine . 
Should I be concerned that an older lady said she was \enjoying my body\ " while I was fixing her phone ? " 
5 minutes ago a chick asked me if we sold computer power cords . 2 minutes ago a guy asked me for directions to AT&T . I always thought the Sprint logo on my shirt was obvious ... seriously people lol 
So some dude just asked me if I could be his personal trainer . Yet another awkward moment at Sprint ... 
Helped a guy with a < PROPFIRST > curl like < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > last Thursday , and today I help a guy that looks like ( and talks ) like the situation . Never a dull day at Sprint ... 
Snickerdoodle cookies are an awesome way to start the day :) thanks < PROPFEMALE > ! 
The power just went out at work and the parking lot is pitch black ... ( cue eerie video game music ) 
It always amazes me how after I leave the barber shop I feel like my head lost 5 pounds lol 
Crysis 2 in less than 10 minutes ... 
Just got my HTC Arrive today , and I never thought I'd say this , but so far this is on par with my WuBerry . Only time will tell if I ditch BlackBerry for good ... 
Social Feeds and BBM on the WuBerry , Last.fm and Xbox Live on WuPho7 - I could get used to this twin-fisting thing ... 
Ok , so in the past few weeks I've been approached to be someone's bodyguard , and more recently , someone's personal trainer . Now someone just asked me to get their iPad 2 for them at 3AM tomorrow so it won't get stolen . My muscles have their own life now . 
Staying in today - the Fit Gamer has a lot of work to do so I'm helping him out hehe :) 
A huge shoutout goes to my boy < PROPFIRST > for being on Sabado Gigente just now !!!! 
Just ported the WuBerry number to Google Voice . It's official - I'm leaving BlackBerry in favor of Windows Phone 7 ... 
1/2 mile run , 50 back extensions , 1/2 mile run , 50 pullups , 1/2 mile run , 50 pushups , 1/2 mile run , 50 crunches , and one more 1/2 mile run . I have officially gone insane . 
I . Hate . Meatheads . Grrrrrrrrrr . 
I love haircuts ; I always feel spiffy afterwards :-P 
It's a good morning today , though I seriously want to go back to sleep right now ... 
When are people gonna learn ? Cell phones and bodily fluids don't match :( 
Frak ! Another one today ! Aaaarrrggggghh @ #6 $&% *$&$&$&* $$&@@#$ bean dip . Seriously - why are people so gross ? 
Ok ladies , a heads-up : if you weigh 100 pounds soaking wet and are a size 1 or less , then a d-cup is going to look unnatural . You'll also attract douchebags . 
Sales rep : Hi - Welcome to Express ! Can I help you find anything ? \ 
Me : The 1MX shirts , oh they're right here . \ 
Sales rep : Wait : Can you even fit in our shirts ? \ 
Best line ever :-P 
I just passed the first of two certification exams to be a PC tech - jaaaaaammmmmmmm !!!!! 
Another Sunday at work , and another phone with brown stuff in it ... smh 
Ok . So the AC in my car is busted . The dealer is offering to rape , er , repair it for 1400 and change . My car's mileage is just north of 100 grand so I'm wondering if it's time to retire the Wu-mobile and upgrade ... 
So I have some ideas for my birfday that's coming up and I want to do something this weekend . There's the hard rock , the improv ( < PROPFIRST > Murphy's performing ) , and extreme kart racing . Opinions ? 
So I'll be headed to the Hard Rock later tonight for an early birthday celebration . Hit me up if you'd like to come out . Or you can also just show up :-P 
Thanks everyone for the birthday wishes . I'm fortunate to have you all as friends :-) 
Bringing your kid to the gym + not watching him × letting him play with weights 3 times his size = FAIL . 
Is currently DJ'ing for the first time in 5 years . I missed this ... 
I just saw a middle-aged man dance to 50 Cent & Jeremih's \Down On Me\ " a few moments ago - a definite Hallmark moment :-P " 
Is wondering why the concept of personal space is foreign to some people ... 
Actor Game-\ 
Actor I was given : Halle Berry\ 
Movie I loved : X-Men Trilogy\ 
Movie I liked : Swordfish\ 
Movie I hated : Catwoman\ 
Like this and I'll give you an actor ... 
It's hard to wait , but even harder to give up ... 
I have veins popping out from behind my ears . I have officially creeper myself out . That would make the Hulk jealous . :-) 
Is listening to \What They Do\ " by The Roots at the moment . Thank you Pandora for reminding me what great hip hop sounds like :-) " 
I'm wishing my stats in the 360 version of black ops could transfer to my newly acquired PS3 version ... 
Paying for last night's trip to < PROPFEMALE > Garden . It was worth it though - good food and good people . 
Gears of War 3 in less than 4 hours ... 
Definitely wasn't planning on a 2+ hour workout tonight ; Juggernauts apparently don't stop . GoW 3 in less than an hour ... 
I'm posting this on behalf of the 3 girls here at GameStop in support of their gamer bfs . They . All . Look . Pissed . Lol . 
Two hours in to my Gears of War 3 late night bender , and I find myself wanting cookies ... 
Google Wallet + Nexus S 4G = WIN 
So it's just about 10:30 in the am and I have a sudden urge to go to the gym . This is unusual even by my standards ... 
I have an important , ground-breaking announcement to make : I like cookies :-) 
When I was 17 I ... \ 
Worked at- The Gap\ 
Wanted to be- A superhero ... and a physicist\ 
Was in a relationship with- no and body\ 
I was afraid of- failure\ 
I drove- a Palm < PROPFEMALE > bus\ 
Like this and I'll give you an age 
To the confused chick in Publix :\ 
It is my duty to inform you that Ugg boots and the Pajama shorts you walked out the house in were not meant to go together . S.M.H. 
No more mini-fro . Haircuts are awesome :-) 
So I was in GNC a moment ago and the guy in front of me was having the clerk check other stores for male enhancement pills ... Awkward .
