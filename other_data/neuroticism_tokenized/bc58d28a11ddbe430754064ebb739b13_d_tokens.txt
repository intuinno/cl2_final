Two hours loading GS cookies into cars and my back is sore . Ah well , at least now I can track down the mosquitos that have been eating my family and I in our sleep now .... Or I could < PROPFIRST > Izzard .... 
The problem with having a prompt like \Government is Religion\ " is that it is reeeallly hard to not sound like you're criticizing certain people and institutions when all you really want to do is sound smart and get an A . " 
I'm grumpy , tired , and pms-y . Everybody be nice to me . 
Tonight is going to be so bamf ! Can't wait . :) 
Thanks everyone for sendin ' me some b-day love . Love yall !!! And now I go to Tahoe < PROPFIRST>'s steakhouse , wearing bright pink and sequins with a felt-ish < PROPFEMALE > to match . Oh , and a pageant sash . What have I gotten myself into ?? 
< PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland . Good fun . We took up most of the row at the movie theater . We were loud and most likely annoying . But not as bad as the chicks sitting behind me . One of them put their foot up on the back of my chair and I was going to be annoying and < PROPFEMALE > back and forth to make her put her foot down but then I realized she had a knee brace . I stopped but she still could have asked ... 
3 1/2 hours of sleep . Yeah , that plan sounded better last night . Humph . 
I was doing research for Japanese class and I found a site written Japanese . A little notice pops up and asks me if I want to translate the site into English . I say yes . I love technology . :) 
Just bought the < PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland soundtrack . I am so pumped about seeing it again in Imax 3D ! :) I love being geeky . 
I wish I could just fall asleep tonight and when I wake up , it would magically be Saturday .... 
It's amazing how many people are having a boring spring break .... Kind of ironic ... 
I could go on Jeopardy .... Well , no . But hey , why did no one say yeast for the fungi that helps bread rise ?? Not Mr. Chemistry teacher or Ms. Drama teacher or that other chic whose occupation escapes me .... 
Had fun chilling at the S . Pas drama department . Found someone on the team who lived down the street from me and we talked about < PROPMALE>'s Hawaiian Bakery and stuff . Good stuff . :) Thank you Meeks . 
Bones and Fringe come back on tonight ! No joke ! And I got sour belt candies . I is happy . :) 
Call me , peeps . I is gettin ' cabin fever . 
Had about 3 years worth of drama at rehearsal tonight . I know you're jealous . :P 
According to Amazon , it'll take about 24 trade in games to buy one new one . And then it would cost me a quarter not including tax . Damn ... 
I love being a drama geek . :) 
Bones , Fringe and House are going to have musical episodes . I love life . :P 
This is the first time I've felt that Saturday was Sunday . I'm figuring out if this is good or bad .... And I'm still waiting for those song lyrics I've been promised . You know who you are .... * shifty eyes * 
The stress is starting to get to me . Just two more weeks , just two more weeks .... * yoga/zen pose * 
All energy has been drained from me this last week . Goodness gracious , I swear I still feel jam on my arm ..... 
Iron Man 2 was pretty boss . But staying up till 2 is less so .... * zonk * 
Impromtu weddings on a trampoline and Canada are fun . :) 
Who cares if you disagree , you are not me/Who made you < PROPMALE > of anything ? /So you dare tell me who to be/Who died , and made you < PROPMALE > of anything ~ < PROPFEMALE > Bareilles\

It finally is starting to feel like summer . None of this hailing crap . :) 
Hey , any pop sopranos wanna learn < PROPFEMALE>'s part in Glee's Poker Face and sing it with me cause it's stuck in my head ? Just curious . 
Went on a Target run . Bought Glee Showstoppers , dog treats , and gum . Lady at the register looked at me like I was sorta weird . 
My baby sister's corruption is nearly complete . I got her her second video game and her new fav song is Glee's Bad Romance . I love being the older sis .

I stink at being a stalker . 
I <3 < PROPFEMALE > Bonham < PROPMALE > . 
My female brain is quite lovely . Talking to four people , listening to music and doing quizzes all at once . :) I'm so proud ! 
Two things . 1 : I'm going to kick a cat if < PROPFEMALE > sings Bad Romance one more time . \ 
2 : I will ram my head through a door if she won't stop being so oversensitive and bratty like crying over the fact that I didn't hear her question and therefore didn't answer it . \ 
..... I want a hamburger . 
Freaking out over my Engrish . Chinese accents are such b*tches . 
Anyone want a stickbug or two ? We have to get rid of my sis's classroom pets ....

Had my first pedicure today . I have flowers on my toes now . And sparkles . Never knew feet could be so feminine .... 
Cold , have a headache and am pissed off that the snooty , over-previleged divas who think SO highly of themselves always warp the truth and find loopholes to get what they want . I won't step on my soapbox , so I'll leave it at that . 
Last night's performance was awesome !! Come see TWELVE ANGRY JURORS !! You know you want to . 
I know too many people that this may relate to so ... : People of the world who'd like to see < PROPMALE > Potter 7 a day early , give me $14.50 tomorrow and I will get you a ticket ( that is , I hope cause these tickets are going faster than the shirt on < PROPFIRST > Lautner's chest ... ) .

Happy Turkey Day and all that ! 
Why do choir concerts always get in the way of auditions ? Namely auditions for Into the Woods which is my soul ? Rawr ... 
Feeling a little down and lonely but inspiration hit me like a train so now I can't stop writing . Hopefully it'll be student directed/written play material . :) 
I'm cold and I'm damp , but at least I have Epic < PROPFIRST > . :) 
Everyone come to the GBHS Band and Choir Winter Concert tomorrow and Friday ! But mostly tomorrow because yours truly will be singing a duet with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Santor on Thursday only !!! 
Hour and a half til I have to go back to school to present my IOP with my crappy sore vocal cords . Yay . 
Has found her old wooden rubber band gun and feels like one cool kid . 
My arm muscles are rapidly developing as I have been holding a baby for the better part of the afternoon . :D 
Going to a fundraiser breakfast and , with my mother's insistence , getting a pic with < PROPFEMALE > . 
Anyone have any metal/rock albums they'd like to share ? I'm inspired to add some to my musical library after hearing Ozzy's \ Mr. Crowley\ " which is very epic . XD " 
Making bon-bon ornaments while listening to ABBA with the little sis . Tis the season ! 
It was nice to get out of the house and see friends ( I'm such a recluse XP ) . < PROPFIRST > Sheeketski , you and I . WOW . It's going to happen . :D 
Mood : Content . :) 
Crab , Zombie Fluxx , Set and parodies on youtube . It's been a good night . :) \ 
P . S Have you seen the fog out ? It's a night for < PROPMALE > ! 
It's weird to know that half of the day-light hours are gone when you've just woken up . XD 
Is it sad that the last five things posted on my wall are those \unlocked tags to describe you\ " that my friends did ? " 
:3 
Love is so embarrassing\ 
I'm this awkward and uncomfortable thing\ 
I'm running out of places to hide it ~ < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > Youngs 
Learning to play guitar ! I feel like a rock < PROPFEMALE > with my throbby fingers . :P 
Honor choir rehearsal was AMAZING ! I can't wait for Saturday ! ( Connor Ceiling-Fan Soejoto , I feel that a revival of our Asian Tourist Play is in order . :3 ) 
Muuuuch too tired . Still , anyone care to < PROPFEMALE > sometime soon ? 
Flipping channels last night and I saw there was a program about spectrophilia . I laughed very hard . 
Eating chips hurt my head but they taste so guuuuuuud .

Anyone else wanna see The < PROPMALE>'s Speech ? I know it ain't a big blow things up or rom-com movie but I want to see it desperately ! 
Driving lesson on my birthday . :/ 
How much does Lup Sync cost and do people want to hooliganize ( yes I made that word up ) afterward and go out ? 
About to buy $30 dollars worth of music and I ask myself , \Is this worth it ? \ " ... Yes . " 
Part 2 of my music buying adventure : Back in Health & Safety , my teacher told me that this one hormone that is linked to memory loss is released in a large amount after child birth so the mother is more likely to have more children since she can't remember part of the pain . I feel that this and buying music are very similar . ( I.E. I HATE ITUNES !!! ) 
Part 3 : After individually copying and pasting each song into a drive and then onto my walkman , I am done . Good night ! 
Went 50 mph 3 minutes after I started driving but I survived ! Yay ! \ 
Btw , thanks everyone for the birthday wishes ! 
New glasses ! Everything looks so shiny ! 
Been practically immobile for the last 5 hours . I hate being sick . :( 
Five hours of cleaning my room . Floors are un-walkable but everything else looks lovely ! 
2 out of 100 expected hours wasted on Pokemon White done ! \ 
#Ilovebeinganerd !

Happy Birthday Mr. Sondheim . \ 
P.S. Any < PROPMALE > you can send me to New York this April to see NPH in your musical , Company , with co-stars such as < PROPFEMALE > LuPone and < PROPFIRST > Colbert ? Just give it a thought . Thanks . 
A small river has developed in my backyard . At least I'm inside . :) 
Thank you Into the Woods cast for making me cry from laughing and from touching moments ! Great job ! <3 
Finally moved ! All our kitchen supplies are at the old house though , not that we need them cause we have no stove or oven ..... Take-out anyone ?
