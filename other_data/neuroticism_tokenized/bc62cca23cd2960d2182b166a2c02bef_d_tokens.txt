\Few people understand the psychology of dealing with a highway traffic cop . A normal speeder will panic and immediately pull over to the side . This is wrong . It arouses contempt in the cop heart . Make the bastard < PROPMALE > you . He will follow . But he won't know what to make of your blinker signal that says you are about to turn right . This is to let him know you're pulling off for a proper place to talk . \"" 
If I actually make it to work at 7am on time today I believe I should get a reward
