< PROPMALE > Hammerstein , the man I loved and father of my two beautiful daughters , died peacefully on Wednesday morning . We will be celebrating his life at the Highlands United Methodist Church ( 3131 Osceola ) this Wednesday , December 16th at 4pm . Thanks to all who have already reached out to our family with your support and love . You have transformed this extremely difficult time into a life-affirming experience . 

Just had my new iPhone activated today ... yay ! It's so cool ... and now I am , too ! 
went thrifting yesterday and found a bunch of cool t-shirts and TWO gorgeous summer dresses . Come on summer ! 
is attending the Mile High Scholars awards ceremony . < PROPFEMALE > rocks !!! That's my girl !!!! 
hosted our first open house yesterday afternoon . Within an hour of it ending , I'd received TWO offers !!! Soon we'll be moving within walking distance of the girls ' school ... my stars are aligned !! 
has our home under contract and just submitted an offer on the new home . Keep those positive vibes coming my way ! I need a signed contract by end-of-day tomorrow to get that tax credit myself . 
is breathing a great sigh of relief . The home I wanted is now under contract and I will benefit from the tax credit ! Woohoo ! 
I'm living a charmed life . We have the MOST perfect home awaiting us ; the current owner gave us all we asked in repairs and MORE ; we shifted the closing dates so we can go on our annual Kids ' Raft Trip ; plus an Apple store employee GAVE me a $130 power cord I needed today !
