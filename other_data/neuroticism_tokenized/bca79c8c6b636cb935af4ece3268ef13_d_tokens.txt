I'll be at a school tomorrow imaging a couple of labs full of iMacs with a dual-boot image capable of running WinXP and MacOS X . 5 .

Heading home in a few minutes . More Macinsteining to come tomorrow . 
When acknowledging reality , one must not leave out possibility . 
It's pouring down rain here . I don't know if those of you who don't live in the desert understand what a big effin ' deal that is . Suffice it to say the commute home is going to be tricky .

If you take your kids to the park . Please watch them . Please pay attention to what they're doing . Don't be a yapping idiot gossiping with your Three-Pill < PROPFEMALE > friends while your young'uns run around aggressive , crass , and unsupervised . You will incur the wrath and contempt of people like me - people who are actually RESPONSIBLE parents . 
We have Wednesday off , of all days , for Veteran's Day . 
We found two female beagle puppies underneath the shed in the back yard . We're waiting for animal control to pick them up . We just don't have the room for them right now . Damn shame , too . I'm trying my damndest not to get attached .

Each human being is made up of a vast set of traits . In reality , no single trait completely defines an individual , yet most of us have a tendency with people we meet to define ourselves as our career , our sexuality , our race , our interests , our social status , etc , etc , etc . 
Just heard ( from my new brother-in-law ) a story of a gunnery sargeant who failed to order his company a month worth of chow because he was too busy on WoW - six times . I would have loved to be a fly on the wall when this guy explained why he derilicted his duty at the court martial . xD

Two portabella mushrooms + a pound of spinach + three green onions + a clove of garlic + an avocado = effing WIN ! 
The boys are sick . My poor guys . :-( 
We watch too much HGTV . xD 
Today some acutal project work will commence . This project will now be known by a new name . The actual work will not change , but heaven forbid we call it by the old name . Shhhhh ! NO ! Not the old name . Never the old name ! Freaking politics .... Well , at least the same work is still there - even if it now goes by an alias . :-) 
off to work - and to complete a project ... at least it's Friday , eh ? 
Weekend , beeshes . 
I'd like to know , if you have a smartphone like a blackberry or droid that is web capable , what you pay per month . My provider wants to charge $30/month extra for their blackberry web plan . I say f*ck that . Those with an iPhone need not answer because I ain't going to AT&T . 
We're going to make a kick-ass yakisoba - with salmon belly - tonight , methinks . Good luck to < PROPFIRST > Borusiewicz at the half-marathon today ( he's probably finished already ) .

The U.S. Senate has become the armpit of democracy . Way to blow it , ladies and gentlemen , for crying out loud . 
Had an allergy scare last night . I ate what was left ( only a few spiral noodles ) of some pasta my oldest son was eating , that happened to have been made with shrimp . No actual shrimp was in the bowl , but I still had a pretty nasty reaction . Fortunately , the benadryl outran the reaction and I didn't have to go to the ER . Phew ! :-O 
saturday morning ...... what to do ? 
Three . Day . Week . Done ! 
In the last hour a storm has rolled in , clouded up the sky , dropped the temperature by fifteen degrees , and produced some pretty stiff winds . I dread the commute home this afternoon .

Refocusing concentration on installing software . I'll worry about activation later . 
thinks it's asinine that all the < PROPMALE > instant messengers require you to sign in to change the setting that will supress the little bastards from running automatically when windows starts .

Tomorrow would have been Granny's 72nd birthday . Instead , she will be interned at a national cemetary in Pensacola . I can't stop thinking about her . Today would be the day I'd normally give her a call . :-(

I'm seeing folks post what they like about their romantic partners a lot on here the last few days . All that is good , decent , and honourable compells me to chime in , so here goes : I love < PROPFEMALE > because she has encouraged me to face my demons and finally begin to vanquish them , even when I chose to fight her on their behalf . She's there to give me a shoulder to cry on - or a kick in the ass - whenever I need it .

First bike commute today . 2.4 < PROPMALE > , fifteen minutes . Not bad . I will allow myself twenty , just to be on the safe side . It was 45 degrees , but definitely NOT cold enough for a sweater . I'm sweating my ass off . 
Something reeks of bullshit : My brother-in-law was denied transfer entry to Valley HS because he had two fights at < PROPMALE > . Give me an effing break . Bear in mind , these fights would have never occurred if he hadn't dared * gasp * defend himself . Nevertheless , we have to mount a challenge to this moronic decision . Wish us luck . 
A fact of life : After Monday and Tuesday , even the calendar says WTF . 
Second day of bike commuting : I'm certain that the ride will take between 18 and 25 minutes each way . I had to buy a new , more comfortable seat on the way home yesterday because by butt was sore ( waiting for inuendo-related one-liners and puns ) . Other than that , I kinda like how things are working out .

And now , another ridiculously < PROPFEMALE > day here on SoNev . 
So , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is getting his 8th divorce , and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > is possibly getting married for a 9th time . < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > and Tiger Woods are , well ... you know ... Even Newt Gingrich is on his 3rd marriage . Yet the idea of same-sex marriage is what is going to destroy the institution of marriage ? REALLY ?!? Feel free to copy and paste if you agree .

finds it amusing that folks on the right think their interpretation of the Constitution is the only correct one . How arrogant of a group of people to even pretend they have any way of knowing the founding fathers ' intentions ! Haughty are they , but pride comes before a fall . 
This is the second year in a row that my allergies induced pink eye and have kept me out of work . It'd be nice to get a shot and be good to go for the whole season ... oh wait ... cures aren't profitable enough anymore , better to send me to an allergist for ten appointments and gouge my insurance . F**k you , medical community . F**k you . I'm going to Mexicali for my shot ... the one that actually works .

Most would probably take issue with the fact that I don't appreciate being volun-forced to socialize at work , but there's nothing I can do about that except be honest about it - and even be willing to explain myself should the request arise . 
I'll be heading to Gameworks/Showcase 8 with my brother-in-law this evening . Midnight Maximum Tune ( video game ) time !!! I'll get to race my 800 hp Supra ... the only 800 hp Supra I'll probably ever get my hands on . :-D 
I didn't drink this weekend at all . I don't think I want to for a while . I kinda like how I feel . Maybe only on rare occasions I'll drink . I'll play it by ear , but ultimately the < PROPFEMALE > just isn't really there anymore . 
Today had a record high of 110 . That's up from 63 on 5/23 . It's 114 outside our house . 
I just figured out that my sister lives closer to New Orleans than we do to L.A. Google Maps FTW ! 
87 degrees at 6:41 . Bring on the HEAT !!! 
Tuesday ? That's it ?? I thought for sure I'd wake up and it'd be Saturday already . meh . I heard my Uncle has moved back to California and is settling in . Can't wait to see him and his fam . Anywho , I need to get off my ass and get ready for work .

\Heres a crazy idea . How about we spend time \ 
TRUE BLOOD FTW !!!! 
It's good for me when someone makes me examine my own behavior and really ponder what I do , what I say , and how I act - and my reasons for the same . I think it's horrible that I've been so unreceptive - to the point of hostility - towards anyone who either wants and deserves to be understood or just wants to help me be a better person . 
We'll be continuing a monstrosity of an network infrastructure project today at a newly constructed technical academy located minutes from Red Rock Canyon . Yeah , they've built that far west ... and more . They'd develop the canyon itself if they could get away with it . 
Summerlin drives me nuts . It's a challenge to find anything because they think they have to make every building as nondescript as possible , while blocking the already miniscule signage with non-native foliage . I'll take Winchester and Downtown any day . 
At West Career and Technical Academy , the new school where we're installing the network , all the awnings on the main quad are topped with solar panels . Effing cool . 
Just found my grandmother's widow on fb . I have mixed feelings about contacting him . He has indicated with his actions that he desires to be left alone , but there's 24 years of connection there . * shrug * He's still grandpa to me , even though we're not blood . \ 
Damned ambivalence . I hate fences . 
< PROPFIRST > is playing a game online called \Neon Rider\ " that features a sick ass Drum n Bass mix for a soundtrack . He told me he really digs the music . :-) "

Tonight at 6:20 I'll be showing up to try out/audition for First Platoon - Making the World a Slightly Safer Place . I want this to work out . It looks like it'll be a blast , even if I am just an extra and I have to work in 115-degree heat with full clothes and zombie make up on . :-D \ 
I read that Captain < PROPFIRST > Dye will be training the lead actors < PROPFEMALE > Corps style . Oorah ! haha 
Off to First Platoon - Making the World a Slightly Safer Place ... to , urm , help make the world a funnier place ? We shall see . 
The audition involved me shuffling across the room Night Of The Living Dead-style and growling . Maybe they'll call me . Maybe not . It was an interesting experience either way . 
\And if there were a God 
I'm effing tired of having headaches every damn day . >:-/ 
Headache is gone - wondering what the evening will bring ... Eleven days and a wake-up until VACATION ! 
¡Viva < PROPFEMALE > por toda la gente ! 
We're watching Zombieland ... again . In a couple of hours the < PROPMALE > will be doing its fireworks thing . We're a stone's throw away from all the big fireworks shows at the casinos now that we've moved - so we're pretty excited that we'll be much closer to all the action . 
I'm kicking back and enjoying my day off . Gonna build a volcano with the\ 
kids this afternoon . 
To all my folks : Our plans , tentatively , will place us in Atlanta , Pensacola , and < PROPMALE > , in that order , for four days each . This will occur between 7/14 and 7/28 . \ 
Can't wait to see y'all! 
\Guilt is what you feel because of the kinds of things you've done . \

You know it's July here when it's 91 on your front porch at 4:15 a.m. In a couple of days we'll be in a place that has the same daytime highs as we have nighttime lows . :-) 
I've had a muscle twitch in my right tricep since Saturday evening . I've about had it .

i've got this old drunk dude going batshit every time i do a r < PROPFIRST > ermey impression . haha good times .

I wouldn't be back at work until Monday if I didn't like my job . 
' bout to take < PROPMALE > to the vet re : urinary problems . I figure it's either the Prednisone he's been taking or his organs beginning to shut down due to the cancer . That's why I'm leaving it the hands of the expert . I'm sure she'll know what's up .

So , we got a . 5% pay cut due to budget constraints a little over a year ago . On this check , they gave it back - retroactively . . 5% adds up over 2015 hours , to the tune of $323.60 extra on this check . :-)

I'm spending the evening getting the brother-in-law's laptop ready for him to use . 
Stoked to see Primus at The Joint at The Hard Rock Hotel at midnight Saturday . \ 
A little background for y'all: Primus have been big fans of Rush , who \ 
will be playing at the Joint and a different concert right before Primus\ 
on the same night , for many years . The two bands are have a well-established \ 
rapport and are known to appear on stage together whenever they share a venue . 
Oh for crying out loud , phone memory card stuff ! Copy already ! 
Frickin ' hell at least it's Friday . 
I'm frustrated . I'm unwilling to talk about it so don't bother asking - not that talking about it does me any good anyway . 
Frustration is gone because cooler heads always prevail . This morning involved the two of us talking things out and getting shit done . It was a constructive conversation . \ 
That's how we ( usually ) roll . :-) 
My kids totally dig The Mars Volta's Cotopaxi video , especially < PROPMALE>'s mask . They lol'd . 
it's packed in here . primus @ 12 ! 
they only have one high value room at this school , which is going to make things a bit interesting the first couple of days of the project . 
If marriage is a religious issue , then the government shouldn't \ 
recognize it at all . 
Lots of incoherent chatter from the t-mobile operator . She has to be one of the wackiest customer service people I've ever spoken to . I was beginning to wonder if she doing shots at her desk and was just in an especially festive mood . My brain hurts . \ 
She DID help me , at least . 
The more I hear the right whining about the proposed Islamic Center in Manhattan , the more it amuses me . So much for freedom of religion . Furthermore , they act like only Christians died on 9/11 . I assure you , there were people from many parts of the world and many different practitioners of many faiths in those towers .

Get to work , you bum . 
I'm effing spent . For real . 
I've had a family member or two decide that they no longer want to maintain contact with me on here , perhaps due to my politics - or maybe my sense of humor . I have no control over how they react to some of the stuff I post . Their reaction is THEIR responsibility , but I'd still like to maintain contact with those family members . \

Oh , in case I forget tomorrow , HAPPY BIRTHDAY MARINES ! 
I'm driven to delirium by a variety of factors that are detrimental to my sanity . It's work related - on one side , low-voltage contractors that say f**k your standards .

The good news : We're doing a project in which the school ordered Macs . This means cake unboxing , imaging , deployment , etc . \ 
The bad news : It's a school that has outdoor hallways and it's supposed to be in the forties all week . It was FRICKIN ' COLD today . 
When running , I prefer short distances at a high intensity over long distances at a low intensity . I feel better afterward and it doesn't put as much strain on my joints .

Thanks for all the birthday wishes folks . I welcome getting older because age ( in theory ) comes with wisdom . :-) 
I learned last night that Glynn Brodbeck ( my uncle ) will be in town at the end of the month . I'm pretty damn excited ! 
So my crew told the staff at TGI Friday's that it was my birthday , unbeknownst to me . Out of nowhere four of the wait staff came out with a sundae and a song . Good times ... :-) 
Well , I spent the afternoon imaging iMacs and watching Metalocalypse . Time to go home . 
Once again , I'm having a ge t-t ogether at Komol Restaurant at 8 . Feel free to drop by for some Thai food and some conversation .

Granny would have been 73 today . I still miss being able to call her . In other news , I got a card from Grandpa < PROPFIRST > . I need to sit down and write him . \ 
Lots to think about today . 
They decided to ship towers instead of desktops to this high school . The towers ' significantly larger footprint creates a logistical effing nightmare for my team and me . ffuuuuuuuuuuuuuu ..... 
< PROPMALE > Pawlenty is one voice from the right that reflects some damn class . He condemned violent discourse in an interview with < PROPFEMALE > Couric this evening . Not passion and fervence - but violence and lack of civility . \

Just filled out a magnet school app for < PROPFIRST > . I really hope he gets selected .

Just saying . 
You don't need a magazine with 30+ bullets or a . 50 cal ... unless you can't hit the broad side of a barn . In that case , you probably should stay away from guns before you hurt yourself because it's clear you can't handle a firearm properly . \

I'm tired of back and joint pain . I'm switching back to the pool for the forseeable future . That is all . 
Lulzworthy event of the day --- Watching guys on my friends falling for a link to a ' < PROPFEMALE > minaj sex tape ' that , based on the icon associated with it ( gears ) , is clearly an application that is probably being used to phish people's passwords . 
The Obama admin is double-talking when it comes to Egypt . 
I read that Men's Health is launching a ' feminist blog . ' I almost spewed my iced tea at the laughability of that concept . I don't trust it worth a shit . I'll stick with dadcentric.com and manofthehouse.com . 
The power is out for the entire neighborhood where the office is located . 
I dreamed I was being held hostage by < PROPFIRST > Beck and an unknown female accomplice . They didn't hurt me . They just forced me to sit there and listen to his drivel , which in the dream sounded like gibberish .

You know it's chest congestion when you wake up with a voice like Darth Vader . I don't suppose I'll be singing to myself in the car over the next few days . 
I'm groggy as hell and my voice is gone . At least it's Friday . Good times . 
Though I'm a bit late to the party , I think its fitting that I congratulate the people of Egypt for forcing that dirtbag who called himself their leader for thirty years to step his sorry ass down . So ... congratulations , people of Egypt . 
Never has an administrator , because she couldn't handle her onery ass teachers , thrown me under the bus like this . What a < PROPMALE > move !

Tell me how it went . 
The ' Good Men Project ' has offically pissed me the fuck off . They have given voice to a whiny MRA type who openly denies that women have -EVER- endured oppression at the hands of men . Fuck that guy and fuck those guys . 
It's kind of surreal hearing what sounds like several news helicopters hovering over your office complex . The kids are restless ... namely the ones from Chaparral High School . I like seeing someone around here stand for something . :-)

It's official ... the CCSD Board of Trustees unanimously approved a 2500-person reduction in force ... 2500 layoffs . Hopefully I won't be one of them . 
I just found out that I'll have my current CCSD job at least until 1 January 2012 . Negotiations are on the table to extend that into all of FY 2012 ( meaning 7/1/2011 - 6/30/2012 ) . 
Just saw a news anchor have a derp moment . I can't help but laugh because these folks are paid to NOT have derp moments .

Senators ... ' we need this . we need that ... ' what we need is a congress that'll stop grandstanding and build a system that is fair to EVERYONE . \

Aiight . I'm shopping for a new home system . Not willing to spend an arm and a leg . Just need something robust enough to handle some kids ' online games , e-mail , some media , etc . Barebones probably won't cut it , but I don't need the most leet gamer system evar , either . I will admit that I'm not the most up to speed on hardware . Suggestions ?
