The opposite of happiness is boredom , So the question I should be asking isn’t , “What do I want ? ” or “What are my goals ? ” but “What would excite me ? ” that's it . I Do not need to work harder when the solution is working smarter , only I need to set up the right system for my lifestyle : time , income , and mobility ... in autopilot ...
