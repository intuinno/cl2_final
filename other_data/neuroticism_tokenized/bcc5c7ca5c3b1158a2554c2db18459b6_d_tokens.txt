SUFJAN STEVENS ' NEW ALBUM !! YES YES YES YES YES\ 
Bought it and is amazing . Am I in love ? Yes . Am I surprised ? No . 
is gonna die of candycorn overdose 
The coldness is about to begin : I am about to die . Utah's October 25th is equivalent to Alabama's January 16th . Winter is going to suck . 
Thank goodness . All that horrible snow has finally melted . We're back up to a balmy 40 
: Making delicious tomato soup . MAKING it . Like , doing more than microwaving some Campbell's . 
: Halloween is over . Let the Christmas music begin !! 
Finished registering for classes . Eck , 18 credit hours . Who's ready to die ? 
I am an old soul 
So . It seems that 4 months of stressing for my portfolio submission into the BYU Arts Program was completely useless . Turns out ... I was already accepted into the program . Yeeess 
Hmm ... nothing like facebook and a full bag of cheerios to keep you procrastinating every assignment that you're supposed to be working on . 
Was I the only one in the world who didn't know that \Temperance Brennan\ " ( from the show BONES ) is Zooey Deschanel's older sister ? " 
Cleaning checks for BYU Campus Housing suck . But hey , my bed's been made for the first time in a month :) 
Nothing fixes a bad , unfullfilled , non-productive day like some 90's pop and cake batter :) 
I plan on becoming a Jewess so that I can sing all the songs to Yentl ALL OF THE TIME 
I want somewhere to disappear to . 
I am a rock . I am an island . 
Heeeelllllllooooo Auburn . It's good to be back 
Hooray . 24 hours back in Auburn and I've already gotten my first ticket . 
I just realized that my three albums of < PROPFEMALE > Apple are nothing but 32 songs for jaded women . Perfect . 
Aye I'm 19 , yo 
I was following the I 
Watching < PROPFEMALE > online ... 
So . I guess I have an okay cool older sister . 
Well , in a single , seemingly innocuous mix up of lithotine and acetone , I have effectively erased 8 hours of a print drawing . This is somewhere between a facepalm and a fml moment . 
3 hour later , my hands are black with printing ink , my entire body smells like solvents , liquid gum-arabic , and anti-static sprays -- but I have 16 lithographs . And I have never been more relieved . 
Um ... I guess I'm a Sagittarius now ? 
Why can't my life be like a musical 
Ugh . February is truly the \Tuesday\ " of the year . New Year's and Christmas are long gone . Spring is still far away . Not to mention that horrible invention of < PROPFIRST>'s Day . Nothing is good about February . " 
Being in college gives you so many options ! Should I , A)Waste time on facebook ? B)Spend exorbitant amounts of time on youtube ?, C)Get in touch with my inner Gaga ? D)Sing along to every Glee cover that I can find ? or ... actaully do some of my homework ? Meh , probably not that last one ... 
Having messy hair is my feeble attempt at being counter-culture at BYU :/ 
Dear 50% of BYU's male population , \ 
\ 
Please know that your ukulele playing is not making the girls swoon . \ 
Sincerely , \ 
Everyone suffering from a migraine 
Well , I spent my < PROPFIRST>'s Day eating gummy hearts and reading < PROPFIRST > Sedaris . Yay for love . 
For as much as I complained , < PROPFIRST>'s Day actually did have one great redeeming quality : FEB 15th = DISCOUNT < PROPFEMALE > EVERYWHERE 
Life would be so much easier if I was < PROPMALE > . 
Passion Pit = LOVE 
Well , there went my 4.0 ... 
So , my day : Woke up late ; had new zit ; tripped on the road ; some IDIOT in sculpture replaced the setting water with scalding hot water and completely melted my wax sculpture ; forgot bio homework ; had horrible grammar all during French class ; nearly failed my Geo final ; found out my Lithography grade has permanently destroyed my GPA ; went back to sculpture , spilled burning wax on my arms ; went home and binged on < PROPFEMALE > 
* sigh * I think I'm finally coming to terms with the fact that I'll never sing like < PROPFEMALE > Hudson or < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > . 
Hiked Angel's Landing . In the snow . Barefoot . 
Oh < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > ( as well as every black woman singer from the 60s and 70s ) , you make my soul complete 
I swear , the BYU < PROPMALE > Department is trying to kill me 
Finally . Fall 2011 is on its way : Chemistry , Sociology , Teaching The Developmentally Disabled , Studio Seminar , Advanced French Grammar , and New Genre . Yeesssss
