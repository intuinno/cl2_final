\You have brains in your head . Your feet in your shoes . You can steer yourself in any direction you choose . \ " - Dr. Seuss " 
Headed to Harrisonburg with the fam =) 
And do you feel the fire when the flame gets hot ? \ 
Are you living every day like it's the last you got ? \ 
Will you step aside when it all falls down , \ 
And watch it burn away ? \ 
Have a little faith when the walls cave in , \ 
Pray for strength to fly against the wind . \ 
Will you walk away when the fire gets hot , \ 
Or fight another ... Another day , yeah\
