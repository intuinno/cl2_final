R.I.P. < PROPFIRST > Gray . You truly entertained the masses for a decade and left a lasting < PROPFIRST > on this earth . You will always be remembered for bringing joy to so many fans , me being one of them . I will never forget you . 
Glance into the blackness hidden \ 
beneath your surface\ 
And enjoy the suffering , sanity drained in disrespect\ 
With such bedeviled faith in good , subsequently trusting evil\ 
Next step for mankind will be the last seasons in sin 
Left are the kings of the carnival \ 
creation\ 
Carrying out the echoes of the fallen 
we're done !

LIKE this status and I \ 
will send you a wall post saying something I like about you ... set this as\ 
your status if you're brave ! 
For there is nothing in between\ 
For I am the accomplice\ 
Aghast and tender , indulged in sin\ 
Embraced by loneliness , legions who grin\ 
I blunder into the realms of slumber\ 
I collide with the obscure\ 
And see the last fraction of light go by . 
Ok so < PROPMALE > Wright , < PROPFIRST > Handricken , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Carpender , < PROPMALE > Fournier , < PROPMALE > Turgutalp , and < PROPFEMALE > Littlefield , let the epic poke war begin !
