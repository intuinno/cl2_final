Hey guys I would like help with a name for the villianous forces of my current RP overarching story . 
I have a facebook . Now everyone wil suffer . Muhuhuhahahaha . My plans for universal domination are nearly complete . O \\/ O 
Metrocon Is Over ... Sooo Tired -.- 
Mah PC still having BSOD . Apparently its an Asus issue , so I sent in a ticket to them because I am covered by warranty . 
I am not part of a group of EVIL supervillians planning to conquer the planet ! 
How come in every movie the computer is a < PROPMALE > . If someone used a PC the movie would probably work in the users favor for once . 
Re-Joined < PROPFEMALE > for a while . 
Why cant I use a Strip Mining Laser on enemy vessels ? 
I just realized that in < PROPFEMALE > I have a better reputation with my enemies than my friends . In fact they stopped firing at me and are offering me quests . 
Spy R'ound Here ! 
is bored . 
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 ANNOUNCED !!!! XD 
K so now I also have Soul Calibur IV . 
Purchased Starcraft II . Add me in the game . 
A good game is something you want to own . \ 
A great game is something you want to beat . \ 
An epic game is something you want everyone to own . 
But < PROPFIRST > , Wont dat disrupt the Space Time Contenium ?! 
Anyone up to try out Shadorun ? \

This week has been nothing but bad luck . 
Can someone remind me why I hate Guild Wars . I really want to go Dungeonering again . I even have a shovel ready . YOU NO TAKE SHOVEL !! 
Quick question everyone . Was it a Meteor , or a Meat-Eater that killed the dinosaurs ? 
I hate those days where everything goes wrong . I have been a firm believer in luck , because when an incredible number of desireable or undesireable coincidences happen in a very short period of time that is beyond your control ( many are not everyday happenings ) You kinda start to believe in it . 
If you decide to make a game . Make sure you don't die in the trailer like this :\

Now that we don't have the store , can we get a thread going for places to hold D&D ? 
!! Attention GameClub Members !! The last 2 participants have not picked a game to play for the tournament the last 2 sessions . This week I want to suggest 4 games . You all vote on which one for tomorrow . \ 
1 : Left 4 Dead 2\ 
2 : Mortal Combat ( any)\ 
3 : Starwars Battlegrounds 2\ 
4 : Unreal Tournament 2004\

That is all 
Yay . New game is out tomorrow , and with no School or work , I'm going to be shooting some robots :D 
Apparently they finally found a habitable planet near our solar system that has an absolute < PROPMALE > of sustaining life . Gliese-581g 
I don't need no shit ! We gotta keep movin ! 
Hey everyone !!! The Game ! 
YAHOOO ! New router ! 
D . Grey Man is on Netflix Yeaahhhh !!!. Guess what I'll be watching ( after I finish Karas , but I have 1 hour left on the series ) Oh and Ghost Hound is on there too . 
LUGARU IS ON STEAM WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT !!!!!!!! 
Noticing , people are trying to stay away from me . 
Im looking into better places to host game club . I'm starting with areas near my house because I may be able to rent out a room for free in 3 places . 
I just noticed . In Borderlands , why is it I can find $2364 in a dumpster ? 
Okay , when people were developing characters for my game , many people complained about the initial races . because of this , I want people to develop a new native race and a curse . The native race will be something that only lives in the starting region . The curse would be tacked onto your original race , similar to lycanthropy or a vampire . If nobody responds , ill assume you were all content with the available races . 
I beat borderlands and made it to the Vault , but all I found was soda . 
It's impossible to triforce on facebook ;/\\ ; 
If you like my status , robots will kidnap you in your sleep and take you to the < PROPFEMALE > . 
Lol I went to register on Minecraft today , and apparently the website was attacked by hackers today . 
Omg did not know . Atlantic ocean was named after Atlantis , not the other way around . Atlantis was named after the Greek god Atlas , who was supposed to rule it . 
I hate this shit . I got tickets to go to Necronomicon , and I took off work . Then they never sent them to me , so I am missing it . 
They are Taking the Hobbits to Isengard !!!!!!!!!!!!! 
I do not lose , I just procrastinate victory ! 
YAHOOOO ! Cleared for Shadocon !!!!!! 
Oh Nexon , how you try to make a good game . I shall show my appreciation of your effort in trying your new game , though we all know how it will end . 
Shado is AWSOME ! I met Egoraptor , and the voicer of < PROPFIRST > Elric . I also shook hands with and spoke to the Nostalgia Critic . Also tons of pokemon goodies , and 2.5 hours of kicking ass at brawl . 
!!!!!!!!! IT'S FRIDAY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
I feel bad , having to get out of my car and ask for $0.50 to pay for a toll . All I had was $20.00 dollar bills and it was exact change , nobody manning . 
You and I should _______ before 2011 . Post this as your status and see what you get 
< PROPFEMALE > many MMO's . None of them good . Some of them are enjoyable , but when you want to play an MMO , you want a world , not a game .

Dragons are nearly unstoppable and , in case you didn't know , they can also breathe fire . 93% of people won't copy and paste this because they have already been eaten by dragons . 6% of people are sitting in the shower armed with fire extinguish ers & the remaining 1% are Awesome like me and repost .
