Missing my husband 

So I have decided to actually start using facebook Yeah Me 
Today is my anniversary .... YEAH Ilove my hubby so much 
So I no longer have a guard dog .... instead I have a guard toddler 
Just home from the beach and it was awsome I learned I actually can play a sport 
Waking up sucks .... time for a new day hoping to get stuff taken care of 
I know the experts say exercising is good for you but they also say if it hurts dont do it ... I wish they would make up thier minds . 
Life throws so many curve balls ... I am having a hard time keeping up 
getting woke up unexpectadly sucks .... arent toddlers wonderful 
Really missing my gadget but I have great friends helping me kope with the lonliness YEAH for good peoples 
Ok been studying my butt off for almost a month and all the hard work paid off this morning ... I finally passed the freaking test time to celebrate then relax 
Up and feeling ok considering surgery was this morning ... Cant speak all that well now that thw anastesia has worn off but all is well orhetwise 
Ok this sucks i am hungry and cant eat at least nothing solid anyone have any tips a way to make really soft food taste well in any way appetizing 
So super excited today ... My daughter arrives at 8:30 tonite to spend her spring break with me . I wont be able to do a whole lot with her due to the surgery but long days by the pool sounds like an excellent vacation to me 
So i finally found something i can eat that has taste ... Feticcinni < PROPMALE > with brocolli as long as its cold yeah me
