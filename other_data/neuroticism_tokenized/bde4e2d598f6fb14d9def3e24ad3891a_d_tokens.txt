My eyes my no longer see , and ears my no longer hear , but my heart .... it feels all the better :) 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > I have a really important question to ask ..... Does this look infected to you ? 
Learning to play hysteria :)

Well fml . saw the doctor today and it is official , I tore my acl and miniscus . I now need surgery that will put me out of sports for months :'( 
\Curtains\ " is killing me " 
I just watched an ACL reconstruction video , its nice to know that my surgeon is gonna be drilling holes in my bones and ripping fibers out of my knee . 
I cant stop thinking about \Curtians \"" 
Who doesn't love string cheese ?!?!?!?! 
when what's complicated become simple I will have finally woken up . 
I feel like I am finally seeing clearly for the first time in my life . I just hope and pray it can last longer than a day . :) 
I benched 205 for 2 reps today , and I feel as if my weight is fast approaching that number . Especially since I will no longer be aloud to exersice after this weekend . But who knows , I might start focusing on my school work .... nah :D 
I am deffinatly tooo sexy for this . So I'm just gonna forgive you and keep having a good time . :) 
When I see your smile I can't help but wanna sing and dance through the hallways :)

Well I am not going to school tomorrow . Definatly cannot handle pressure . 
I now prepare to return to school tomorrow . Definatly not good , I cannot last long enough withoug my pain killers to keep my knee from exploding :D 
Yup .... it still hurts 
Walking is sooo much fun with crutches and a knee that doesn't bend 
Physical therapy hurts even when they aren't doing anything :) 
My life is pretty damn good right now I think !!! It's about time I should be feeling on top of the world again . Not being able to walk changes your attitude about things . 
Is it strange I would rather go to PT than school ? At school I just want to sleep . 
The people at Disney Land must find it incredibly amusing to cut off the cripple kid in a wheel chair . 
I love cali !!!! Why must I return to the madness of school on Monday ? 
There is a lazy Saturday in store for me . 
I consider it extremly weird when a nerd becomes jealous of another nerd , but hey that's life and I can deal with it . Im finding my place :) Thank ' ee all !! 
Getting ready for the POPS concert that you should all be attending !! 
I am so very tired of Mrs. Smith's Honors English class , but the weekend brings new hope for life and excitment ! 
My dad just bought a tv with a diagonal longer than I am tall 
Is watching < PROPMALE > and the chipmonks like a real man 
We each walk a seperate path , they wind and twist and turn through the wilderness and sometimes they intersect and run side by side , but only for a time . Eventually all paths seperate and the distance you have traveled with others is the true measurement of your lifes accomplishments . :) Make it last . 
Corn Dogs and Lord of the Rings !!!!! What could be better !?!? 
Mom says it's time to go to bed =P adios , buenas noches everyone 
When I walk through my waking dreams , it's your face that I see guiding me towards a more permanent future . 
I'm all shook up mhhmhhmhh !!! 
Castle is the greatest show on the planet !!! 
I am sorry for all you Obama fans , I was willing to overlook a few things and try and let him do his job , but now that he is screwing NASA up it is official . Obama sucks !!!!!! 
Beta testing at Mountainview community center again , it's good money !! 
It be damn hot outside !!!!! 
I have a problem with math class .... pointless . 
I don't know about anyone else , but I'm tired of being tired . 
Will all the stupid people just stop talking about the immigration < PROPMALE > ? Let the police do their jobs , if your are breaking our laws just by being here , go back , and come through the right way . It is resonable and is perfect !! 
Just want to let everyone know that AAEC's prom was in a phrase .... The most totally bodacious good time man !!!!!!!! 
Great start to a great week . I can feel it in my heart , and thats new to me . I get to give blood again tomorrow . I hope everyone has an amazing week too !!! 
Full range of motion when forced !!! whoohooo 
Had the greatest week ever !!! Great time last night at < PROPFIRST > Lins Ym ' s weeding . But unfortunatly today was dreadful . I did apply for a job at 3 places though , so at least there was some practical application to my boredom . 
Contemplating the complexities of the soul to find true happiness , wish me luck . Any help is apreciated . 
Why is it that if anyone ever mentions blood , the conversation must inevitably turn to vampires ?!?! 
Applied for 2 more companies but 4 different locations for one . I hope I get a job ... I mean who wouldn't want to hire me ? I am awesome . 
How is it that I can sleep without any rest ? Or that I can fail without taking a test ? Life is full of paradoxes . Can they be awnsered ? 
Ready to relax the weekend away and chill with friends . Some sleep would be helpful as well . Only one more week before finals . 
So through the combination of today's events such as re-painting the roof , lifting heavy objects and noodle hockey at youth group I managed to throw my back out . Perfect Sunday ! 
Ok , so muscle relaxants make you sleepy , and now my afternoons went from boring to peaceful rest . But amaazingly I am still tired . 
So instead of camping I cleaned my room and my parents bathroom ... Yay ! 
Finals are a terrible waste of my precious last days with the seniors !!! 
I'm actually feeling sort of confident about tomorrows chem test . all I need is a high B to keep my A . Sleep tight my little neurons , fire rapidly tomorrow ! 
It is official , I am the chem guru . 98% on the final without any < PROPMALE > studying . I am only concerned for one class right now .... English . 
Ok , it officially feels like summer ! 
Excited for tomorrows epic bike ride of the summer with < PROPFIRST > Rider and < PROPFIRST > Michl :)

Be happy no matter what ! It's freaking summer damnit !!! 
Liscence in hand ready to become a man =P the test was a piece of cake :)

Getting a hair cut .... Should be interesting . 
I'm not the kind of person to halfass something important ... I go all in , all the time ! 
You are not fighting against racism now , you are just reinforcing stupidity . 
Hopes and Dreams for this years cross country and soccer seasons smashed ... I need a hobby until track season , any ideas ? 
I'm pretending to be a shy man pretending to be confident pretending to be shy ... Did I get it all ? 
So every time I go to an aquarium place like Seaworld or the new Sea Life Aquarium at the AZ Mills mall , I end up questioning my future career choices . That can't be good for my health .... 
Actually likeing East of < PROPFEMALE > , for a summer reading book it is amazing :) 
Are we really so stupid in < PROPFEMALE > , a country founded on freedom , to try and refuse people the right to practice their own religion ? Let them build their mosques ! I kinda hope they bomb you when they finish building it . 
Going to bed now with an empty mind . That little girl on < PROPFEMALE>'s Got Talent it the most amazing vocalist of all time . Look her up and cry for a bit . 
So < PROPFEMALE > Scalise , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > Phillips , Aidan Levine , and I need to figure out our group name for English . 
I would appreciate it if people stopped posting their mushy and/or depressing statuses ..... At this point it's just beyond stupidity .

Does anyone have a way for me to learn all 50 states and their capitals fast ...? Like now !!!!

To Save A Life ...... It will change your life , and everyone's around you 
So I officially suck at the bass ... yipee ! 
Sometimes speed bumps are helpful . Maybe you don't really want to be flying down that particular road at 90 < PROPMALE > per hour .... 60 maybe ... but definitely not 90 . 
skimbleshanks can lead you into dark places ! Don't ever follow him ! 
Chatting with my favorite people in front of the computer with my own tub of Strawberry Cheesecake ice cream .... life got better , way better :) 
Save a horse , Ride a cowboy ! 
Perfect Day ? I definitely think so :) 
I never thought I would say this , but I need to be transported back to AZ pronto . I miss it .

God takes pity on the haters .... :/ sad day for mankind 
So the techies totally screwed up our big debut ... Way to go , turning the sound off on us , not cool !!! 
I think I might need a new profile picture ... Anyone up for a photo shoot ? =P 
Can't help but look back on what could have been and start thinking about what can be . You always get what you want when you go for it , the trick is figuring out what you want . 
I would say something deep , but I feel soaked in tallow , \ 
I would say something sleek , but I'm feeling really shallow . 
Come together .... Right now ... Over me ! 
so my eyes ..... Perfect , the doctor even told me so . 
It may be difficult to lead the blind and deaf , but trust me , its worse trying to lead the dumb . 
Ok , so what is my next move ? Any ideas ? 
So Tuesday ended up being worse than Monday ... this isn't right .... 
Truth is .... I'm not gonna tell you . 
So ABODA didn't really go as well as I had hoped or expected :/ oh well , and all of my computers suck . What a day . 
I'm serving my community outside of basha's on indian school and < PROPMALE > =P come see !!! 
Being ignored by the people you care about is so sick ....

When President < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > died someone asked one of his servants if he thought he went to heaven , he replied \if he wants to be\ " my favorite quote now . " 
so cthulhu just killed < PROPFIRST > beiber on south park , life is good

Let's start a tally , All who think I should regrow the goatee like this status . If you think I shouldn't , tell me why . 
Just read 3 chapters in the AP American History book in less than 2 hours .. I dare you to do better . 
< PROPFIRST > is my favorite person :)) 
Thank each and every 66 of you for posting on my wall today . But a word for those who slacked .... Like-ing someone else's comment does not count as wishing me a happy birthday :) thanks ! good night . 
So I had my first Notre Dame rehearsal today and I already have a blister on my finger ! Gonna be a good play !!! Oh and I changed my language on facebook to spanish ! life is amazing !! 
Bahahaha ! Life .... despite its many challenges is good , and I am content . Thank you one and all for making my days happy in your own special ways :) 
Been exploring facebook now that I changed it to spanish and your \Relationship Status\ " in spanish is \ " Situación sentimental\ " .... this entertains me . " 
Just totally redid my room today .... it is sick !! It has room for so many new instruments ... like a piano maybe .... 
Stupidity is contagious and as far as we know there is no cure . Thank you my friend for giving it to me . 
I <3 < PROPFEMALE > Byrd 
So for those of you who didn't like the pens in my ears , rejoice !! For < PROPFIRST > LunadelaFuente was fed up with them and bought me new gages . Thanks , I love you ! 
Coming down with a cold , but it will not dampen my mood one bit :) 
They say perfection is impossible to find . But in my opinion if you look hard enough , you can't help but find it . 
It is said that good things come to those who wait . It is also said that to get what you want , one must fight for it . I am pioneering a way to do both . 
Anyone else still working on their censorship paper ? 
Gonna pass out from all of the stress , \ 
But I'll never love you any less . \ 
As far as I know I haven't committed any crime , \ 
And so I pay for yours with all my time . 
I have recently discovered something . When a girl is jealous of how attractive another girl is and a guy happens to mention that fact , the first and only response they have is to claim she is a man .... how lovely .

No matter what I say or how I act at times , the things that truly make me happy are the simple moments I have with my close friends that cannot be shared with the world . It does not take money or fancy things to fulfill your life . As a wise man once said \The man is richest whose pleasures are the cheapest . \ " < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Thoreau " 
Aidan Levine : \Did you hear that ? \ " \

I finally get to go to track practice tomorrow and do work :) I can't wait to become a healthy athelete once again :) 
It's kinda nice that my computer doesn't work because it limits the amount of time I spend on facebook . I am not addicted ! 
so I was walking down the street in downtown phoenix , wearing my rave jacket and cowboy hat and some lady passed me on the opposite side of the street , she came back , snapped a photo of me and went on her way . Best day ever ! 
Today ... not bad , accidentally set my pants on fire and won a medal . Good times .
