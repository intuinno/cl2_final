I love that moment . When you're on a long car ride , or listening to music . And you completely zone out . You forget your troubles , and everyone around you . You're focused on that one thing , and that one thing only . You're content , and everything seems peaceful . 
Yay party today ! get to see my wifey :D 
You have to get hurt . That's how you learn . The strongest people out there , the ones who laugh the hardest with a genuine smile , those are the people who have fought the toughest battles . Because they've decided that they're not going to let anything hold them down , they're showing the world whose boss . 
I want people to know that there is nothing more badass than being who you are . \

We cross our bridges when we come to them and burn them behind us , with nothing to show for our progress except a memory of the smell of smoke , and a presumption that once our eyes watered . 
Sometimes I feel like I'm mentally going to explode , and there's just nothing I can do about it .
