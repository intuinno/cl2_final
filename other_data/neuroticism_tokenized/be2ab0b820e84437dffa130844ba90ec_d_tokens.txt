got a 100 < PROPFEMALE > from work yesterday , shit's cash . 
my mind is ever expanding like space , holds more secrets than you can comprehend . 
At the hinder concert , I seem to have lost my ear drums cause all I hear is music . 
Just got my T.I.P. so far this week is pretty damn good . 
I do not wish to be in for work today .... for the GM of my store is gunna be there . 
At the hot tub with my fiancee . 
sick and tired of hearing about how a mom won't support her daughter and her daughters dicisions , constantly knocking her down with negitivity . You need to stop . 
Lost an important ride , have to do a bunch of fuckin house work , I have no ciggs , and I got fucking burned in the shower . Today really sucks . Only good thing that's happened today is my fiancee is here with me .
