Listen to everyone . Ideas come from everywhere . 
The best year-round temperature is a warm heart and a cool head . 
No one can make you feel inferior without your consent . 
Your smile will tell you what feels good . 
time . 
Every flower blooms in it's own sweet time . 
Because you expect more from yourself , others respect you deeply . 
The philosophy of one century is common sense to the next . 
Now is the time to try something new .

A smile is your personal welcome mat . 
If you would be loved , love and be lovable .
