This is the gloaming . 

Hooray < PROPMALE > Kemp ! 
What's less likely to happen in our lifetimes ? The Cubs winning the World Series or the NL winning the All < PROPFEMALE > Game ? 
is writing a paper ... and class has not even begun yet . Eh ... 
There wasn't much history available at UCR . I have History of the Old South , Europe Since 1945 , and British Literature this quarter . Hmm . 
It's only 91 degrees today ! 
saw Casino . Insane people . 
USC flopped in the Pac-10 again ? What else is new ? 
Hard to find fault with the Dodgers ' game plan of \walk everybody . \"" 
Apparently the Dodgers forgot both their pitching and hitting in LA . Usually when they're on the road they forget one of them , but this is a special occasion , so they left both behind . 
Two years in a row , Dodgers stupidly blow a lead in game 4 that they should have won . Meh , whatever . Hopefully the Yankees beat the Phillies . 
It's been a long time since I saw USC get crushed by another team . Happy Halloween ! 
can't play a videogame or watch TV right now because his roommates are studying too loudly . Amazing ? 
USC destroyed again ? At home ? I must tell the world ! 
AHHHH 
is writing a paper on a really depressing memoir . Fun . 
Hooray ! They found my car ! 
has a book of Ludovico Einaudi sheet music . Hooray . 
The Packers/Cardinals game has become amazing . 
San < PROPMALE > playoff fail 
Too bad NBC won't pay < PROPFEMALE > $30 million to leave . 
I've realized that my goal in life is to figure out a way to get paid to read books . Hmmm ... 
G.K. Chesterton : More fun than a barrel of monkeys . 
The business of liberals is to go on making mistakes . The business of conservatives is keeping those mistakes from ever being corrected . -Chesterton ! 
Think what the Dodgers could do if they could pitch ... 
Thanks for all the happy birthday wishes everybody ! 
Somehow I have a lot of homework to do ... and yet none of it is for class . Paradox ? 
Having a multiple choice test for a history class is possibly the most idiotic , asinine , and inconceivably stupid thing a professor can do . Any one caught trying should be fired , quartered by horses , burned at the stake , electrocuted , and then diced . Then it should be done again . 
Apparently there are a lot of independents in < PROPFEMALE > . We need to join together to form the Independent ( Neo-Bull Moose ) Party ! Platforms would be : 1 ) Policies universally decided in light of Aristotle's < PROPFEMALE > Mean , 2 ) Veneration of < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > , and 3 ) The purging of < PROPFIRST > Beck first , followed by < PROPFIRST > Olbermann . \ 
\ 
Campaign Slogan : \Because We're Not Them . \ " \ 
Studying for a French test . Hmmm . 
Hmm . I just won a trip to Greece this summer . Except now I don't know if I want to go . I met get lit on fire or something . \ 
Decisions ... 
Hundreds of pages of Thucydides ... 
Flying through hyperspace ain't like < PROPMALE>' crops . 
Paper on Calvinism . Hooray ... 
Part of me wants to be like < PROPFIRST > Merton . Hmm . 
Watching the Dodgers and doing homework simultaneously . Kind of . \ 
And Loney just got picked off . Wonderful . 
Trying to study for finals and pack for vacation at the same time is ... not cool . 
Finished the last final ! Now , to get on a plane to Greece . 
status update from Athens . Yay . Dinner at the \Beer Academy . \"" 
was on the news in Greece . 
Greece was incredible . Now it's over -- this is so depressing ...! 
Weirdly jetlagged , and so too tired to sleep . Got my picture card to work , though . 
Summer odyssey continues ! Now I'm apparently going to Massachusetts for two weeks on Tuesday . 
Off to Massachusetts today . 
The New Hampshire Walmarts feature the most disheveled people I've ever seen in my life . And I live next to Moreno Valley . 
Inception was crazy , but Memento is still < PROPMALE>'s best movie . 
Heading back to California today . 
I have no idea where to apply for grad school . Or what for ... Eh .... 
New Arcade Fire album . 
Children of God was a worthy sequel . 
Finally got the Greek People Magazine article in the mail ( and the English translation ) . I've been misquoted ! Outrage ! Haha . 
\Nobody has any business to use the word ' progress ' unless he has a definite creed and a cast-iron code of morals . Nobody can be progressive without being doctrinal ... Never perhaps since the beginning of the world has there been an age that had less right to use the word ' progress ' than we ... [ Where ] the people who have settled least what progress is are the most ' progressive ' people . \ " -GK Chesterton " 
GRE ........ 
Can't say I ever want to read another < PROPMALE > Roth novel . 
So ... many ... college ... emails ... 
Gilead was one of the best novels I've ever read , I think . 
New word learned today : U2-charist . Communion at an evangelical church . 
I'm actually getting worse at math as I study . I didn't think that was possible . 
Muse today . 
Me : \Trying to study French and Greek is confusing . \ " \ 
Take that , GRE . You lose . 
I'm pretty sure heaven is going to be an infinite library . Connected to a pub . That is also infinite . 
New nerd record : Five < PROPFEMALE > paper finished in an hour and a half . Hooray ! 
Memo : Doing a 12 < PROPFEMALE > paper in one evening = bad idea . 
The quarter from hell is officially over . Yay ! 
Tired of doing applications ... 
has a kindle . 
Apparently UCR fixed their transcript machine . Now my entire future isn't ruined ! 
can't write Statements of Purpose . It's sort of like impaling my head on a stake . Sure , there's something new there . But in the end you've lost something as well . 
is at work , answering letters from kids writing to C.S. < PROPFIRST > . They never seem to know he's dead ... 
is beginning a 50 < PROPFEMALE > paper . Yay . 
Well , finished applications . Now all I have to do is wait for the rejection letters . Yessss ! 
The < PROPMALE > of Limbs . 
PJ < PROPMALE > turned into Bjork ! 
Leave it to Radiohead to be even weirder than you expected . 
One week to go -- then finished with undergrad . Wooooo 
Well , looks like I'm not going to grad school . Hell yes . 
Almost there ... 
Thanks to everyone for all the birthday wishes ! 
All this wedding excess just makes me glad I'm an American . No royalty ftw ! 
100+ footnotes on this paper now ... the end is still not in sight . Argh ! 
Finished the rough draft . 49 pages . 207 footnotes . 15,000 words . Yay ! Too bad I'm still not really done ... heh .
