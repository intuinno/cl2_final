Jesus loves you !! 

Two things to tell you all :( 1 ) We are like apples , when we fall to the ground , God cleans us off , and to Him we are STILL special . ( 2 ) God is displeased with us for this reason : lack of knowledge . He gives us two choices ; the \best choice \"-- God knows best " 
It would be good if the Devil lost his job in this economic crisis ! LOL ! 
Never , ever doubt your existence . People mght not agree with me on this , but God's got a plan for all of us . 
Never , ever doubt your existance . God's has a plan for all of us . ( Jer . 29 : 11 ) 
is walking by faith and not by sight .

College is about working for the success of your future , but most college students don't realize that until it's too late . #WellAtLeastYouWentToCollege 
sometines when you get what you want , you end up missing what you left behind #inreality 
I know I'm not the only one who thinks it's a great idea to end all parties with Party Rock Anthem . 
Drama - Left , Right 
I feel surreal 
People live their lives BOUND by what they accept as correct and true , and define that as reality . This is a broad statement ! so this means that different people have different realities , huh ? 
gotta love the support from my family , friends , and loved ones all the same . Ya'll make my day , make me who I am , and help me grow . You all know who you are . 
Two things that give me comfort : rap and Jesus !

1020 - you are REAL example of someone that had to struggle but never forgets to put faith in God and believe in what he says . I'm glad I meat you . And I gotta admit I had a crush on you my freshman year in Unity . 
9/11 - you funny acting . I guess it's because of politics . you flip-flopped on me so many times , I jus gave up . 
808 - we don't talk everyday , but when we do , it's like how i remembered way back when we was in Bogan . you cool as ice ! 
44 - G u my sista , quit playin . you already know how I feel CUZ i just told you last week ! :) but I'll say it .... when I needed someone to step in and help me out you do ! I'm looking for a < PROPMALE > to give back because you already gave so much . I will say thank you 
I'm having break throughs with this number game . good memories 
409 - you are so condescending , cunning , sarcastic , cynical , and a slacker . that's a good combination ! i can't take that question seriously lolol . hey Batman , remember the ph 
7- we've known each other for a very long time . It's never a dull moment with you . thanx for teaching me how to dance ! 
1 - you are my fav , u are hilarious , and I miss you a lot cuz you're fun to be around .

IF YOU COPY THIS ON YOUR WALL YOUR ICON WILL TURN BLUE AND FACEBOOK WILL BE FREE FOR YOU . PLEASE PASS THIS MESSAGE ON , IF NOT YOUR ACCOUNT WILL BE DELETED IF YOU DO NOT PAY 
23 - you stepped up bro . you got a good head on them shoulders of yours . you cool with me bro . 
3 - you are different , but you cool as hell . You good to be around and convos are very interesting and engaging . You taught me some valuable lessons , and you have a strong mind . it's not alot of people with that characteristic . you always find a way to say what we are all thinking and you never forget to keep it real . I hope you get what you want out of life , cuz you keep it real , but you know your limits . keep intelligence alive , bro . 
25 - I always thought you were nice . you take on alot though , It will pay off in the end though . we could have < PROPMALE > out , but i didn't want to cross any boundaries . 
1028 - you did it and i'm happy for you . you been like a mom to me in EIU and I appreciate that so much . 
2006 - new money .... I'll call you that . We're the opposite . You're fiery and explosive . you cool too , and you get all the h*es ! your fashion sense really works for you . I wish you much success bro . 
Write your troubles in the sand , but carve your blessings in stone . 
Good point Spenser Nobles : many people try to STAND OUT by trying to FIT IN . Here's my point : What sense does this make ? at what point do you stop think for yourself- individualization . There's a gray area . Me , personally , I ain't never had a problem thinking for myself or making my own decisions despite what people had to say . How about you ? 
Maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnn . Out at West < PROPFEMALE > wit my bros ... all of them !! lol 
On the way back from West < PROPFEMALE > #Goodphrat
