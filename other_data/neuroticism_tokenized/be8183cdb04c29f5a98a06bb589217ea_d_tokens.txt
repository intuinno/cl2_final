To bring a better ending\ 
Someday , somehow you'll see , you'll see\

AP Music Theory Exam tomorrow then AP Government Exam on Tuesday . After that , High school is as good as done ! 10 days of school left ! =) 
I just haven't met you yet ! =) 
Tonight is going to be one of the hardest nights of my life . Hilliard < PROPFEMALE > Symphonic Choir , you guys mean so much to me and if I didn't have to leave , I never would . I never knew what music actually was until I stepped into this choir . You guys have changed my life in so many ways ! I love you guys and lets have one last amazing concert ! =) 
is officially DONE WITH HIGH SCHOOL !!!!!!!!! Band and Choir people , I will miss you so much ! You guys have changed my life forever !!!! I love you guys !!!!! 
Finally back in Ohio !!!! I'm so ready to get home !!! =) 
It's time for healing time to move on/It's time to fix what's been broken too long/Time to make right what has been wrong/It's time to find my way to where I belong/There's a wave that's crashing over me/And all I can do is surrender\ 
Whatever You're doing inside of me/It feels like chaos but somehow there's peace/It's hard to surrender to what I can't see/but I'm giving in to something Heavenly 
So ..... I graduate in less than 24 hours !!!!!!!!!! =) 
13 years of Hilliard City Schools and 4 different buildings all have led up to tonight ! I will walk across the stage at the Schott and receive my diploma . I can't believe it's actually here ! I'll miss all my amazing friends , Symphonic Choir , and of course , the Marching Band ! Class of 2011 , this is our night ! =) 
So finally , after 17 years , I beat < PROPFIRST > Prior , with a score of 52-55 in putt-putt !!! I would have done it sooner but he played a lot when he was younger and was really good . YAY !!!!!!!! =) 
This is where the healing begins/This is where the healing starts/When you come to where you're broken within/The light meets the dark/The light meets the dark -Tenth Avenue North , \The Light Meets the Dark \"" 
Partyin ' , partyin ' , YEAH ! Partyin ' , partyin ' , YEAH ! FUN FUN FUN FUN !!!!! 
Have you ever truly thought about each day ? None of us are guaranteed another day , another hour , another second . Why , then , do we live on this earth as if we're going to live forever ?! Just think about it . Each day is a gift . Why don't we treat it as one ? God gave you this day , SO USE IT ! Seize the day ! You're not guaranteed another one . 
when you are in the middle of the raging sea , remember God is not trying to drown you . He is trying to cleanse you of all your impurities . 
Lukewarm people think about life on earth much more often than eternity in heaven . Daily life is mostly focused on today's to-do list , this week's schedule , and next month's vacation . Rarely , if ever , do they intently consider the life to come . - < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > \ 
^ Something for me to work on ^ 
Sooooo , I go a Twitter . I have no clue what I'm doing yet but I have one . Follow me @marchingbandie1 
I look like a lobster ! lol , but it was so worth it ! I had a great day with < PROPMALE > Moore ! =) 
Do we obey God because we love Him so much that we follow , or because the Bible says we should ? What's the difference ? One is a passionate , deep obedience whereas the other is shallow and can be done half-hardedly . Which do you do ? 
When you give a luncheon or dinner , do not invite your friends , your brothers or relatives , or your < PROPMALE > neighbors ; if you do , they may invite you back and so you will be repaid . But when you give a banquet , invite the poor , the crippled , the lame , the blind , and you will be blessed . Although they cannot repay you , you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous . - < PROPMALE > 14:12 -14 
Look at all the pretty things \ 
That steal my heart away \ 
I can feel I'm fading \ 
' Cause Lord I love so many things \ 
That keep me from Your face \ 
Come and save me \

With < PROPMALE > at COSI ! going to solve Adventure !!!!!! =) funfunfunfun 
Just solved Adventure with < PROPMALE > in 4 hours !!!!! That's one more thing off my bucket list ! YAY !!!!!! =) 
We are finite creatures . Why , then , do we seek to indulge in other finite things ? Why do we not seek something that's infinite ? What's more important ? Living just for today and the finite things in it ? Or , would our time be better spent seeking out the infinite God ? Think about it . 
Do you want to be a man ( or woman ) obsessed with your own < PROPFEMALE > ? Or ..... Do you want to be a man ( or woman ) obsessed with God's < PROPFEMALE > ? 
True joy and happiness can only be found in the Lord Jesus Christ . If you build your life on anything else , your guaranteed to be disappointed at some point . Why would you want to build your life around something that doesn't last forever ? 
So , I finally got around to watching The Lion , The Witch , and The Wardrobe . The symbolism in that movie to the Bible is astonishing ! I can't believe how much it lines up ! It , such a great movie and if you haven't seen it , you should ! 
The Chronicles of Narnia are so freaking good !!!!!! It's been a really long time since I've read a good fantasy book !!!!!! I love it !!!! =) 
When you feel that there's not anyone , who understands your pain/Just remember all of Jesus's suffering\ 
' Cause I have seen the healing hand of God/Reaching out and mending broken hearts/Taste and see the fullness of His peace/And hold on to what's being held out/The healing hand of God\ 
-\The Healing Hand of God\ " by < PROPFIRST > Camp " 
If only time wasn't about to run out ........ 
I get to be in the fourth of July parade again !!!!!! Although , this year , I will not be playing an instrument ! See you Monday Bandies ! =) 
More and more Lord , I can see my prayers being answered . I've prayed for you to mold me and shape my life but it's hard sometimes . It's hard for me to truly change the way I've done something for so long . Please continue to mold me and shape me into the man you want me to be . Even if I have to go through many more hardships . I know that the pain is temporary and that one day , I'll have everlasting joy . Amen . 
Parade today !!!! Yay for getting paid to walk down the street !!!!! =) 
So bored .......... Someone should text me and we should < PROPFEMALE > out ! =) 
Just got my ticket to the DCI show tomorrow night ! So excited !!!!! =) 
Parade's are like Halloween ........ but better , because the < PROPFEMALE > comes to you !!! =) 
Soooooooo , all the bands in the DCI competition have been all brass bands ....... therefore , there is NOTHING wrong with an all brass band !!!!! =) ( < PROPFIRST > Drake is giving me the death stare ) 
Just got < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE>'s new book \Erasing Hell ! \ " ......... kinda excited right now ! You should read his other books : Crazy Love by < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > and Forgotten God by < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > . He's an AMAZING author ! " 
CEDAR POINT !!!!!!!!!!!!! =) 
So , Mr. Miller just stopped by the library to tell me that I got a 5 on my AP Calc Exam !!!!!!! Best ......... Math Teacher ........ Ever !!!!!!!!! =) And , I don't think I have to take any math in college !!!!! Yay !!!!!! 
Finally got my AP Scores !!!!! 5 on AP Calc AB . For Music Theory ; 4 on the Aural section , 3 on the Non-Aural Section , and a 3 overall . Lastly , a 5 on the AP US Government and Politics . I guess now I can give < PROPFEMALE > Niksa Messick a thanks for the million and one court cases we had to do ! =) I am quite happy ! 
I feel like I'm the only person in the world who hasn't seen ANY of the < PROPMALE > Potter movies ! ( or read ANY of the books) ! 
Had a great time watching < PROPMALE > Potter with < PROPMALE > Medley and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Beardsley . The latter of which wouldn't keep her mouth shut about what was coming up ! ;) lol 
< PROPMALE > OS X Lion is AMAZING !!!! Loving the full screen apps and all the other new features !!! 
The only way we'll ever stand is on our knees with lifted hands . Lord make us Courageous . 
As I was waiting to get into the roundabout , I had 2 cars ( in a row ) stop to let me in . I refused . I'm really flattered that they'd be considerate enough to stop all traffic to let me in , but I know how to use a roundabout , and that's not how you use it . 
It's been a long time since I've felt this kind of peace . It's strange but it's very , very good . 
MC-ing VBS all week with < PROPFEMALE > Zalewski ! I'm so excited ! I love little kids who love Jesus ! \ 
Jesus called a little child to him and put the child among them . Then he said , “I tell you the truth , unless you turn from your sins and become like little children , you will never get into the Kingdom of Heaven . So anyone who becomes as humble as this little child is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven . \ - < PROPFIRST > 18:2 -4 " 
One month from today I'll be moving into college !!!!!!! August 25 , 2011 ! < PROPMALE > University !!!! =) 
More and more I'm learning just how much God really loves and I'm understanding more just how much it cost Him to forgive us . It's absolutely amazing how much we don't deserve it and yet he still cares enough about us to wait patiently for us to accept it . My mind will never be able to fully comprehend it . I've grown a lot and learned a lot this year and I'm so thankful for it . 
All these status's about band camp this week make me really sad that I'm not going to be there ! =( 
Had a great time at the Ohio State Fair with < PROPFIRST > Rhinehart , < PROPFEMALE > Print , and < PROPFIRST > Rhoadhouse ! Now I have to get ready for work . 
Contrary to popular belief , Light and Dark don't coexist . 
Press toward the light And the light will ground you . Go with the flow And the flow will drown you . Hey now , there's always an out . -\Escape\ " by Newsboys " 
How much is money going to be worth to you when you're dead ? Nothing . So don't worship money . Give to those who need it and don't be greedy . God gave you that money and one day , he's going to ask you how you spent it . Will he be pleased with how you spent your money ? 
3 weeks from today I'll be moving into college , 2 weeks from today will be my last day at work . This is all coming really fast ! It's really bitter-sweet . 
Just got my tickets to the Casting Crowns Concert on November 5 !!!!! It'll be a great night with my wonderful mother , < PROPFEMALE > Prior !!! So excited !!! =) 
Just finished < PROPMALE > Potter and the Chamber of Secrets ! It was AWESOME ! I'm glad I have < PROPMALE > Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban waiting for me at the library because I want to start reading it immediately ! Why have I never read these before ??? 
ICE CREAM SOCIAL TONIGHT !!!!!!!! So excited to see all my Bandies !! =) 
Going to the Sanctus Real and Tenth Avenue North concert tonight with < PROPMALE > Moore !!!!! We so excited !!!! =) 
I am a GREAT sinner ......... but I have an even GREATER Savior ! Nothing I do or say can make me any more favorable in God's eyes . I am more than the choices that I make , I am more than the sum of my past mistakes , I am more than the problems I create , I've been remade ! It's not about what I've done , but what's been done for me . It's not about where I've been or where my brokenness brings me to . It's not about what I feel , but what He felt to forgive me , what he felt to make me loved ! 
Just got my Pottermore welcome email !!!!!!!!!!!!!! =) 
For you have been called to live in freedom , my brothers and sisters . But don’t use your freedom to satisfy your sinful nature . Instead , use your freedom to serve one another in love . -Galatians 5:13 
My mom's already re-painting my room ...... and I don't move out until next Thursday ! Someone's ready for me to leave ! lol 
I learned today there is a name for my sneezing in the sunlight when walking outside ! I have a Photic Sneeze Reflex ! I'm one of the 18%-35% of the population that has it . I learned something new today , it's a good day ! 
Today was my last day working at the Hilliard Library :( Thank you so much Hilliard Library for the amazing 20 months I had there . I will truly miss you all and I promise to visit as often as I can ! You guys have given me so much more love and respect for the library . I'll miss you all !

I am so truly blessed to be in a place where people value and respect God just as much as they value and respect learning . < PROPMALE > University is an amazing place to be . 
Welcome with open arms fellow believers who don't see things the way you do . And don't jump all over them every time they do or say something you don't agree with—even when it seems that they are strong on opinions but weak in the faith department . Remember , they have their own history to deal with . Treat them gently . -Romans 14:1 ( The Message ) 
First day of classes ! Kinda nervous , kinda excited . I've had that feeling all weekend ! It really need to go away sometime soon !

In the same way , let your light shine before others , that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven . ( < PROPFIRST > 5:16 ) Notice how our lives should glorify God . Do we do just human things or do we trust God and do things we can only do with His strength ? Do people look at our lives and glorify God because of what He's doing in it ? Think about it . http://bible.us/Matt5.16.NIV 
I miss being in a mens chorus with 90 guys . The mens chorus here has maybe 30 :( I miss you < PROPFEMALE > choir's! 
Lord , I don't understand Your reasoning on this issue or how You're working in it but Lord , I trust You . I know that when things do finally work out , I'll look back and understand . Just help me to be patient , and Lord , I will serve You and praise You while I'm waiting . Amen . 
Amount of High School Homework x 100 = Amount of College Homework 
We Will Never Forget

Chapel was such an answer to prayer today ! 
Swing Club was AMAZING !!!!! I love swing dancing !!! =) 
Symphony Under the Stars !!! 
Would you dare would you dare to believe/That you still have a reason to sing/Cause the pain that you’ve been feeling/It can’t compare to the joy that’s coming/So hold on you gotta wait for the light/Press on and just fight the good fight/Cause the pain that you’ve been feeling/It’s just the dark before the morning\ 
The sun is beginning to rise around here ! =) 
Spending the day in Indianapolis with my family !!!

I am the thorn in Your crown/But You love me anyway/I am the sweat from Your brow/But You love me anyway/I am the nail in Your wrist/But You love me anyway/I am Judas’ kiss/But You love me anyway/See now , I am the man who yelled out from the crowd/For Your blood to be spilled on this earth shaking \ 
ground/Yes then , I turned away with a smile on my face/With this sin in my heart tried to bury Your grace/And then alone in the night , I still called out for You/So ashamed of my life , my life , my life/But You love me anyway 
The < PROPMALE > University Geocaching Club is now OFFICIAL !!!!!!!!! =) 
Just got the new Casting Crowns CD !!!!!!! =) 
Days will come when you don't have the strength\ 
And all you hear is you're not worth anything\ 
Wondering if you ever could be loved\ 
And if they truly saw your heart\ 
They'd see too much\ 
You are made for so much more than all of this\ 
You're beautiful .
