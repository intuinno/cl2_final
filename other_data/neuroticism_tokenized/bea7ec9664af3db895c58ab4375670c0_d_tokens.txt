Thank you Florida , Kentucky , and Missouri , which are the first states that will require drug testing when applying for welfare . Some people are crying and calling this unconstitutional .

I have felt very conflicted about the Student Body President election for Student Government Association of HPU . Two of my friends are running against each other in a election that turned ugly . I have been with many classes with Yasemin Karabulak ( we are both International Relations majors ) and worked together in the Model < PROPFEMALE > Club . I have met < PROPMALE > Lussier through his discussions with his friends about politics and modern issues and we often disagree . \ 
< PROPMALE > may come out as aggressive during discussions and this makes him look like as someone power-hungry . This is false , we had discussions about how national government should be more free and the status quo is unacceptable . Freedom is one of < PROPMALE>'s greatest values , and more people should know about this . He will < PROPMALE > a sense of democracy and will ask some serious questions to HPU faculty not just to address student issues , but to think of innovative ways to give HPU a better name . For example , he became really passionate when the HPU Pre-Med club should be supported by the school instead of warned about stepping over its boundaries . \ 
Please vote for < PROPMALE > , and show that the Student Body President election is not just a popularity contest , it will be the beginning of a change to a more active student body .
