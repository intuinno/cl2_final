Fell asleep as soon as I came home from the first day of school . ( Doesn't it feel like a Monday to anyone else ? Or is it just me ? )

could barely wake up before noon today . Darn nocturnal habits XD

misses you ! ^^ 
6 guys + 5 moms + 3 girls + 3 dads + 1 grandmom = full house

~ To everyone taking ENGR 151 - is it just me , or is the link to the survey ( on the email ) not working ?

yeah , so uh , I'd like to take a moment and laugh at all the high schoolers , who can't even respond to this post because THEY'RE STILL IN SCHOOL XD 
college does not feel like school at all ... HAPPINESS 
never thought I'd consider sleeping until 11:30 as \sleeping in \"" 
I'm fairly certain \confusion\ " is a default setting . " 
Recap of today : Belted Evanescence , showed of sight-reading/piano-playing skills , and learned how to play Euchre , like I should've ages ago . ( Note : These are not in order of importance ) 
So my dream last night involved using gamecube controllers to move myself , fighting zombies with oil and fire , and then finding that ( after the resulting explosion ) I had a metal cage/bar thing in my chest and neck keeping me alive and keeping me from breathing properly . This is going to be tough to analyze . 
Naruto handsigns look really hardcore with strobe lights ... 
Bleh . I think I'm sick . Or having a delayed allergic reaction to college .

Please put this as your status if you know or are related to someone killed on Alderaan when it was obliterated by the Death < PROPFEMALE > . Our wish is that people will understand that the Empire is a band of murdering scum . The Rebel Alliance wants to bring peace to the galaxy , but the Galactic Empire continues to kill innocent civilians . 93% won't copy/paste this . Will YOU make this your status for at least one hour ? 
~ Yummy flavored gum is such a bad idea . I'm going to mistake this for actual mint chocolate chip ice cream for a second and swallow it in that moment of foolishness . 
will probably be bringing more food from home to the dorm

How many mind tricks can you do to yourself before you implode ? 
made a breakthrough today : I want to create my own programming language . :D 
Just when I thought I was good at controlling them ... I keep forgetting that split personalities are harder to lock in when you're fatigued . 
OF COURSE I'd be the type to have too /many/ semi-colons . Silly me . 
I learn so much more when I look at sample code first . >.< 
Why aren't there any ENGR 100 classes listed online for winter term ? Are they just being slow , or are there seriously no ENGR 100 classes for next semester ? >:o 
OOh , I just remembered that yawning is an indicator of FATIGUE . How convenient ! 
Help me nderstand\ 
Why my thoghts are not focsed\ 
Am I missing \u \"?" 
I think really hope this focus booster doesn't make me crash during the Calc 3 midterm ... 
My brain is so tired . 
21 is enough , I think . Too bad that number will probably go up pretty quickly while I'm here ... 
I might be a cat . 
I am so , so fatigued . Mentally , physically , emotionally . I can't wait until Thanksgiving break . 
Next I stay up late , it better be for < PROPMALE > or for friends .

Break = :) \ 
Breaking = 0 . o\ 
Broken = T.T 
sore throat + Thanksgiving break = less enjoyable turkey ? 
Thanks for giving ! :) 
I'm finding dark music infinitely more interesting than Christmas music ... ( On a totally unrelated note , is anyone up for watching the Nightmare Before Christmas sometime ? ) 
=^o . o^ = ... ... ? 
tabletopping :) .... < PROPFIRST > Utter & Kaisa < PROPFEMALE > Ryding & < PROPFEMALE > Mays & < PROPFIRST > Revels & Dead people = interesting nights ?

To anyone that has taken or is taking Physics 141 - where can you buy the lab < PROPMALE > ? -.- \ I'm starting to think it doesn't exist ... " 
Come on , school . Bring it on !

87/88 on Calc Exam . Where did that last point go ?? XP 
Wow . My impulse to post FB statuses has decreased dramatically since the beginning of college . Must do research ... 
Why do I type in CAPS when I'm tired ?... 
Loves puppies more than any other thing on Earth !!! 
SO NICE OUTSIDE . 
Just used a normal-sized mouse for the first time in ... months ... 0.0 
SMOOTHIE BRAIN FREEZE HURTFUL 
Naps do wonders for me when I'm too lethargic in this daylight for something like studying . I'm so conscious right now , I'm overfocusing this physics to deathness . 
87/90 on Calc 4 final . You know , the one that I finished and left an hour early out of sheer boredom and hunger ...
