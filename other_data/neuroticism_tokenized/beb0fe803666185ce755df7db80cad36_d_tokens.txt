dont go to great clips in north branch . i stood there waiting to get my hair cut and waited for 20 < PROPFEMALE > . to a half hour watching the lady talk on the phone socially the whole time . needless to say my hair is NOT cut . :/ 
color 1 finished . 
' s engineering project proving tougher than first assumption .... 
- < PROPFIRST > 8 , 1-11 
just got off work . little tired .... 
I get by with a little help from my friends . 
O.o prom . 
happy mommy's day . 
-.- woah . 
Started my ballista . Don't wanna go to work though . :[ 
Yet another wonderful day weather wise ... 
Ok ... \ 
Fill up gas tank- check . \ 
Find a way to avoid all household work and tasks- check . \ 
Play some kind of video game/ laze around- check \ 
Drive aimlessly to relieve stress- check \ 
And Have a casual conversation gone wrong- check . ( Open mouth and then insert foot .. Yummy . ) >.< grr . \ 
Well looks like my to do list for today is now done .. Wonderful :\\ 
eff ... -_- 
hmmmm ....... being lost is not fun ... dang . 
-.- felt really lazy today . 
Just woke up to the worst dream . 
I guess some movies just can't come true . 
Doesn't like when technology glitches . Dang iPod . 
waiting to go to wrestle .... 
the more i look at it the more i believe that life is exactly like a wrestling match . In all reality it is very short but seems to be long , thinking too much or too long can cost you big , confidence is key , if you dont care you will lose , if you hesitate you will lose , never do anything half way , without agression you have nothing , and the nice guy in the match doesn't win . 
O.o woah ... xD 
Getting ready for work -.- 7 hour days stink . 
finally going to have some fun !!!! 
Work work work . 
hrmmm ... indeed this is gonna be interesting ... 
got my hair cut and colored yesterday , it looks amazing ! thanks < PROPFEMALE > !!!!! 
-_- got an awkward shift tomorrow for work . yay ... :/ 
Had an exciting day yesterday ! It was crazy ! 
trying to understand >.< 
Nice big serving of confusion with a little ' what ? ' sprinkled on top for flavor and then I also got some ' where do I go now ' after that . Yay .... -_- grr 
got done with my morning workout =] 
hrmmm .... why must my mind wander to the far reaches where i can not locate it anymore ? xD 
ahhh heck ... 
peachy ... 
SSDD -.- 
:( 
i need to stop rolling this freaking ankle ! >.< 
wants a pet dragon , waaay better than any car or truck . i'd fly it everywhere ! 
actually excited for school :D 
uuuuuugh , homework -_- 
So I have come to realize that I am to play an elephant but honestly I usually can't remember a darned thing ... 
Off to work today until 3 . Wondering what I will do after ! :) we'll see ! 
what the heck ?!? my no name road i live on is blocked fully by traffic and no one is moving ... how am i gonna get to work ?!? 
off work !!! yay ^^ , ... now what am i gonna do ? 
You know those times when you can't sleep because that one thing is on your mind ... I actually am fine with this one thing keeping me up . Strange . 
maybe working out will help ... 
i hate looking into myself ... 
hmmm what to do ... 
be glad of the times when you fell on your face , its an open door to get back up better than you were before . 
homework , facebook , and batman returns ... :) multitasking is great 
hrmmm .. what to do .. 
thank you everyone who has wished me a happy birthday 
not happy . 
Where are all the sour patch parents ? 
anxiety why must you haunt me ?... or why must you exist even ?!?!? 
got off work a lil while back ... now trying to solve the conundrum of what to do .. 
had a full day of work ... now movies =] im relaxing . 
wow ..... I wish I had more time ... 
going through senior pics and trying to decide which one to put in the yearbook . then going and completing more questionares ... hopefully i might get to see someone .... please .. 
I hate when this happens ... 
so pumped ! just found out that we have a triangular scheduled at home with Foley and StFrancis on dec . 16th and then a Foley invit on < PROPFIRST > . 8th ! 
Thinking .... 
i hate those days when you know you should be happy but just cant find a way to . 
Wrestling went really good tonight . Happy with our win over st < PROPFIRST > and the team put up a good fight against foley . Although there will always be room for improvement , so we are getting started on that tomorrow ! 
Tired and no quite ready for school . Though I am excited to see some of my friends I couldn't see over break . 
Everytime a door closes another one will always open . 
today was .. interesting , but back up on that horse I go ! 
Home wrestling meet tomorrow ! Come cheer on the team !! 
Grand Rapids tomorrow ! So pumped ! 
thursday i am off to state , looking to make it the best yet this year . 
missing someone 
It's crazy how many memories you can pack away as you fill that box ... 
Tired
