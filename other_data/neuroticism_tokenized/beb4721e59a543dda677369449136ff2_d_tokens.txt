Happy New Year , everybodyy ! 

I'm tired and it's only the afternoon , I blame Nikkie . 
I'm a coward not a fighter , disguised as a lover . — This Providence 
Huh ... I resemble Demi Lovato . Well , that's cool . ^.^ 
Holy crap . I just realized my profile said I was interested in women . LMFAO 
Just finished watching Gran Torino at mah brother's house . Now I'm even more terrified of my neighborhood . 
thinks that more people should take my dog gone quiz . * pouts * 
Oh , my tummy hurts . >.< 
* yawn * I feel like writing but I have no idea what I want to write about . 
Is ... Ah , speechless . 
HOT MESS LEAKED . HOLYCRAPHOLYCRAP . 
is obsessed with Vegas Skies by the Cab . <33 
Rest in peace , < PROPFIRST > Hughes . :( 
Paramore's Ignorance music video is my favorite one of theirs so far . ;D Just felt like sharing ... xP 
is pretty sure I have a Kool-Aid stain on my upper lip ... Yeah , but I'm pretty sure I can rock a mustache . No matter what color . 
I am tired . * slams head against table * I need to get more sleep . 
is irritated . 
is loving Pirate language on Facebook . So amazing . 
is irritated with Twitter backgrounds . Ugh . 
It's blue . 
We will kill you if you kill whales . ( I am sure many won't understand this but whatever . ) 
I miss my XBOX 360 . Those who feel obliged to threaten my brother to return mine , go ahead . 
Think I'll be recording all the fantastic times I have in church tomorrow , fun , no ? 
Ooh , thought I'd share this little piece of information as well . I plucked my eyebrows . I no longer look like a caveman . Consider your eyes blessed , people . Well , there's still the rest of my face that needs improvement ... 
AND , DUDES , ONE MORE THING AND I'LL COOL OFF WITH THE UPDATES . Yesterday was Hug a Vegetarian day . I want my belated hugs tomorrow , got me ? ;D 
I love brand new eyes . My favorite song is All I Wanted . ^.^ I dunno if I'll get any replies , but what's everyone else's favorite song on it , eh ? 
I'm not too excited for tomorrow . I really dislike funerals . 
BUM BUM BUM . My friends seem to be missing . Where < PROPMALE > thou , me he < PROPMALE > ies ? The last few nights have just been ... lonely . >.< 
Oy , I hate getting past the cranky part that comes along with just awakening ... Yeaah , I wake up in the middle of the afternoon . o.o 
My iTunes gets so messy , gosh . 
watching Taco ! Taco ! Taco ! ; Nikkie said it was good . 
Memento Mori by Flyleaf is epicly amazing . Circle is my favorite . <3 I WANNA SING IT BUT THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE AROUND AND IT'S TOO LAATE . 
Sheeseh , lately I've been getting addicted to one song and listening to it fifty times in a roww . 
She falls asleep and all she thinks about is you , she falls asleep and all she dreams about is you . When she's asleep the air she's breathing is for you . Goodness , I love this song to piecess . What's with me and these cheesy love songs ? 
My mother has got the Christmas bug early . She's planning on putting the Christmas tree up already . Not that I'm opposed to it , but jeez , she usually waits last second . 
I need a haircut . Badly . 
I'm sleepy . u_u 
My breath smells like sour cream and onion . As delicious as those chips are , my breath is horrid . 
No offense , dudes , but < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > sounds like a woman . n_n 
I'm sleepy . And I wish I didn't have so much trouble with computers . >.< They all mess up on meee . 
I cannot believe I missed Nate and < PROPFIRST > kissing . Doggone it . 
I can't sleep . :( 
I'll never understand why girls are so desperate . Why be so impatient to be in a relationship with someone who are selfish and have superficial concerns ? It's so irritating . 
I'm nervous . >.< 
Get out of my dreams , get into my carr . 
I want a love letter from < PROPFIRST > Bravener . :| 
I want it to snow . 
I have finally experienced the joys of Facebook . I got my wall flooded with crazy randomness . And that is the meaning of social networking sites . n_n 
When < PROPFEMALE > eyes get brighter , and heavy wings grow lighter , I'll taste the sky and feel alive againn . I feel like singing . But too many people are around . >.< 
I'm sooo happy . n_n 
For you are a people holy to the Lord your God . The Lord your God has chosen you out of all the peoples on the face of the earth to be His people , His treasured possession . Deauteronomy 7:6 ( I think I may have found a new favorite verse ... n_n ) 
Note to self : Deuteronomy does not contain the letter A . :| 
I'm late on this , but Happy New Year everybunny ! :3 
VlogCandy makes me want to go meet Nikkie this year even moar . :D THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP , YO . 
I feel giddy for no reason . Oh , but do I ever need a reason ? 
My Christmas tree has finally finished the duration of its stay in my living room . There's now an emptiness in my heart . 
Why must I get the urge to write all the time and then when it comes to writing , I just ... blank . :| 
I don't know what to say . Oh , poop . 
I'm hungry . Mewantfood . 
I went to sleep way too late to be up at nine A.M. on a freakin ' Saturday . THIS IS WHAT SKYPE DOES TO YOU , I TELL YOU . IT CAUSES HAVOC ON YOUR SLEEPING SCHEDULE .
