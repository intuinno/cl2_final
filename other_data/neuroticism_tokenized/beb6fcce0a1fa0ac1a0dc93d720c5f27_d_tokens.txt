Huge house fire on twin city . 

If anyone wants to drive to tokyo ill buy all your drinks , this week has had a rough start 
I love when you reach out to someone you dont know and they embrace what you have to offer while contributing growth to your own coinscientiousness . 
is pumped about murdering some softballs at the JATC tournament this saturday . kickn ass and drinkn beer all day . 
rainout .... 
Thinks that life is alot simpler when all you have to do is live off the land and survive . Too many people get caught up with trivial matters these days . 
wants to be cryogenically frozen after being in the heat all day . Just for a little bit . 
is loving the symphony of thunder outside my house . 
is wondering who he is going to see at the beach this weekend . 
is wondering what time I can catch KABLAAM on boomerang . Really in the mood for some action league now . 
is about to fry some of the gulf's finest , pig out and then pass out . 
Quade ! Start the reactor ! 
Wine is a good thing . Much better than rain , write a country song about that . 
The birds decided to not help with finding the specks that I was looking for , instead they sat on the bank and laughed at my futile efforts to fish . 
white rabit and interpol put on a very good show tonight . 
Lost costume contest at starbar . lol still had a wonderful time with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > ! thanks girls !

Some people say when life gives you lemons make lemonade . So what in the hell do you make when life gives you shit ? 
Thank you everyone . It was wonderful . 
life can change at any moment . embrace the emotion and the knowledge that comes with this , even if it is only primary for a moment . true memories are those that come to conciousness when not called apon for whatever reason . delve down the paths unseen if they are made known to you , the destination will prove to be uplifting no matter the conciquence . 
You can only truely be happy when you share an early 90's TV masterpiece with one you love . I love my < PROPFIRST > . Oh and < PROPMALE > that gum you like is going to come back in style agian .
