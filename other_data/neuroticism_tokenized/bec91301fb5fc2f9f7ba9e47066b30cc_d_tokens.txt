Change your profile picture to a cartoon character from your childhood and invite your friends to do the same . Until Monday 6th of December there should be no human faces in profile pictures , but just an invasion of memories . This is a campaign against violence towards children . 
So I woke up at 7:30 today BEFORE FUZZHEAD and ate the last slice of Fuzzy's pizza . \ 
Ha Fuzz . Ha . Ha . Ha . 
Dear Snow , \ 
Please become a blizzard in the next 10 hours so you can be useful . 
Winter Ball . Joy . 
I love you <3 \ 
And chocolate fountains . I really like chocolate fountains <3 
So I just spilt cappuccino on myself . Sure , it may have burnt my stomach , but at least I smell really good now . 
Dear everyone who wanted it to snow on Christmas , \ 
LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE . \ 
Sincerely , I can't get to Quick Chek now 
The cappuccino machine was broken , so I had to buy a latte . It's cold . I want my cappy back .. 
1st person to like my status- I will have your last name for a week . \ 
2nd person to like my status- You can dare me to do one thing . \ 
3rd person to like my status- I'll write I love you on your wall . \ 
4th person to like my status- I will answer any question for you . \ 
Put this as your status ... if your brave\

Everyone's last names keep confusing me , so I decided to jump on the bandwagon and make things worse . 
My phone is capable of turning on before I actually turn it off ..

You know you're doing something wrong when the 5-year-olds are snowboarding better than you are .. 
Well , everyone was surprisingly awesome at the talent show ... Maybe it's just our act that loses wigs and dyes people green ? 
So , like for first impressions ? 
After watching Gnomeo and < PROPFEMALE > , I realized how non-aggressive our bunnies really are .. 
R.I.P. Mr. Fuzz . \ 
You were the most docile < PROPFEMALE > ever ... Love you Fuzz </3

You know you've got a true friend when she smacks your face so hard that your head breaks the glass cup of the person sitting next to you .. 
It's probably pretty bad that my should-be-four minute long speech fits on one index card ... 
Panic ! At The Disco lost ... Definitely not the best start to today , but I'm thinking it will get better soon :)
