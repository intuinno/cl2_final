Starting work at IBM tomorrow . 
Today was a big day . I met my father to finally ask him the big question of why he left my mother and me . I'm still shaken up because I can understand his reasoning although I'm against any marriage ending in divorce . 
I'm excited to see < PROPMALE > Potter at 5:15 PM pre-screening before all those crazy fans get in line tonight at the midnight showing . 
I'm so excited to see a pre-screening of < PROPMALE > Potter in 6 hours . The benefits of being part of a software company and getting discounts for those tickets ! 
Whether or not you support the Health Care Reform , I believe it is wrong to make any death threats or even consider assassinating anyone like the congressman and congresswoman had to endure these last two weeks . 
I finally met my grandfather again after 14 years . My grandfather thought he would not be allowed to see me again . 
Why do people bring assault rifles to town halls ? We have an amendment to bear arms but doesn't that cause a brink of fear that someone might be killed or assassinated ? 
Yeah ! I finally got my 250 photo albums down to about 60 photo albums on Facebook ! 
RIP < PROPMALE > Kennedy . Thank you for service to this country . 
I will be heading to the Outside Lands Festival to see the < PROPMALE > Matthews Band play at < PROPFEMALE > Gate Park alongside < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > . Along the way , I will be heading up to Berkeley to see < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > . 
I just came back from the Outside Lands Festival after watching a great show with < PROPFIRST > Mraz , Black Eyed Peas , and < PROPMALE > Matthews Band . It was well worth the money and I highly suggest it for a good day to jam your body for some great music . 
I'm so glad to update my resume and cover letter for the aggressive job hunting this year . May God give me strength to find a job so I can serve for the greater < PROPFEMALE > ! 
I wish both sides of the Health Care debate would listen to each and present a constructive argument . I don't see how insulting , screaming , making threats , making lies , and showing hate is good in anyway . 
I'm watching Obama's Healthcare Speech . I'm very happy for this moment . 
Whoa ! Obama totally called out < PROPFIRST > McCain on his commitment during the campaign ! And McCain acknowledges it ! 
Whoa ! Did that guy on the Republican side really say that during Obama's speech ? I can understand \Boo\ " s but gees ! " 
Coming to work , I encounter a skunk . It's so cute ! 
Last day at IBM ... 
I'm praying hard that I will finish my thesis within three months . 
Sometimes I need to realize that having a tough thesis advisor and a tough statistics advisor is not a burden but a blessing because they care about the end result . 
\Make me a channel of your peace ... \"" 
Is at about 100 pages into his thesis . 
I'm about to head to the Poly Reps Retreat at El Rancho Chorro to bond with all my crazy and funny members . 
I'm so happy to attend Sunday College Mass today with awesome music and being reacquainted with friends . I'm proud of how Newman has grown . 
Alleluia ! Amtrak Thruway Bus Service now has free internet ! 
I need to remember that everything will work itself out . I need to remember that it's not the end of the world if my thesis will not be done on time nor finding a job is not necessarily easy anymore . Ad majorem dei gloriam . 
Absolutely unexpected and congratulations President Barack Obama . \The Norwegian Nobel Committee said it honored Obama for his ' extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples . ' \"" 
Thank God for the rain ! 
No power at the place I'm currently sleeping at . Thank goodness to power at the Kennedy Library . 
FALL JOB FAIR . What is the probability that I will get an interview or a job from one of the companies recruiting Cal Poly students ? 
One day down , another day of FALL JOB FAIR tomorrow . Highlight of my day is when my Lockheed < PROPFIRST > interviewer said that my resume and my skills were outstanding . That's a blessing . 
FALL JOB FAIR was good but exhausting . Now it's time for < PROPFEMALE > . Ad majorem dei gloriam . 
This sounds hypocritical . Fox News is angry at Obama for inviting liberal commentators when Bush invited conservative commentators during his eight years in office . Am I blind to say the correct way for this is to invite liberal and conservative commentators into one room and have them talk with the President . Although there might be blood at the end , it is the most civil way of uniting both sides . 
< PROPFIRST > is working on his thesis , preparing for three phone interviews , and will fly out to Southern California for an on-site interview tomorrow . 
( sigh ) I was so hoping to get \the\ " dream position at Apple . Oh well . God has a plan for me . One door closes and another door opens . " 
At the San < PROPFIRST > International Airport . Flight has been delayed from 7:40 to 8:05 to 8:15 to 8:20 . It seems like there's a mathematical pattern . Can anyone guess the next sequence ?! 
At the Crowne Plaza Hotel near Los < PROPFEMALE > International Airport . The company treated me well with a complimentary dinner , complimentary beer , complimentary breakfast , and of course ... a massive < PROPMALE > size bed ! 
Just completed an interview with Jet Propulsion Laboratories , they are so cool ! 
Just praying that I will get my thesis done , complete my job interviews , and figuring where my gifts and talents should be used for my purpose to God . 
Lunch interview done . Phone screen interview done . Four interviews tomorrow . 
Dear God . Thank you for the gifts , talents , and life to be offered a full-time job . Please continue to help me to do your will and extend my gifts , talents , and life to make this world a better place . 
Four interviews today . Here I go . 
AVENUE Q ! A number of us are seeing the performance on Friday , January 15 , 2010 at 8:00 PM in San < PROPFIRST > . If you like to join , shoot me an e-mail before Saturday , November 14 , 2009 . If I get more than 10 people , we get a substantial discount . 
I'm extremely nervous of my on-site interview . I'm appreciative of my 6 years of learning Java at Cal Poly but would it be good enough to complete the 6 hour interview ? May God give me the memory and logic to get through it . 
I'm in San < PROPFIRST > at Starbucks prepping for my interview at noon . I have faith that the Cal Poly education I'd received and the talents and gifts from God will get me through this . Ad majorem dei gloriam , < PROPFIRST > Huan Vu . 
God bless the veterans who served our country over the years defending our freedom and enabling freedom throughout the world . 
After talking with people , it sounds like the Amazon's interview process is brutal in comparison to Microsoft . Answer me this , \How do you write a Hash Map without the Hash Map class in Java ? \"" 
AVENUE Q is coming to San < PROPFIRST > Center for the Performing Arts . A group of us are watching on Friday , January 15 , 2009 at 8:00 PM . If you like to join , shoot me an e-mail ASAP . 
Heading down to San < PROPFIRST > Obispo for an interview with Amazon , then up to Seattle for Microsoft , and then to Pasadena for Jet Propulsion Laboratories . Oh my !

Apply for Poly Reps ! Info session today at 11:00 AM at Chumash . Applications available on Friday . 
( sigh ) I'm so sad . I was so hoping to get an offer from salesforce.com . Time to focus on other opportunities again . 
Dear God . Please help with the interview tomorrow with Microsoft . May I be able to express my gifts and talents gained from my education at Cal Poly to the technical questions being posed . May the interviewers be open to my thinking and my thoughts . 
If you are up at this time , you are crazy for staying up late or waking up too early . As for me , I'm about to head the airport to fly up to Seattle and prepare for my interview with Microsoft . No doubt am I nervous after being rejected by more than 3 companies yesterday , I'm being hopeful that God has a plan for me . 
Highlight @ 6AM : Two little mice are scurrying around the airport . Why do I have a feeling that someone is going to scream later today at Gate 21 in Terminal A of the San < PROPFIRST > International Airport ? 
Highlight @ 8AM : Met my favorite priest from Mission < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > and a technical recruiter on my flight to Seattle . Still nervous for the interview tomorrow with Microsoft . 
Heading off to dinner with some Microsoft employees . Nervous but again praying that I will make a good lasting impression . 
Dear God , As I head to this intense interview with Microsoft's Productivity Team , please give me the < PROPFEMALE > , clarity , and wisdom to answer all the questions posed to me even the ones that are extremely difficult to answer . May the interviewers be open in mind and heart to my answers to see the potential in me as a candidate at their company . Ad majorem dei gloriam , < PROPFIRST > Huan Vu . 
Flying to Burbank / Pasadena tomorrow . Anyone around ? 
Please . I do not want to be sick now . 
Happy Thanksgiving Everyone ! I'm extremely thankful for the life I've been given and the people who are part of it to make the person I am today . 
Interviews + Job Hunting + Thesis Writing + Graduation Planning + Maintaining Healthy = Insanity . 
God , thank you so much for an full-time job offer with Veeva Systems . I just pray that you can help me make a righteous decision on whether or not I should work the organization . My heart is leaning to yes but will I fulfill your awesome purpose ? 
At < PROPMALE > International Airport staying in the Hyatt . My window has a view of the runway which is wicked awesome . I found my new favorite airport because the way it is organized is efficient , clean , and absolutely sexy . I love it . 
Jet Lag - Yeah ! 
I'm at Phoenix about to board in a few minutes to San < PROPFIRST > Obispo to pick up my graduation belongings and be roasted by Poly Reps . 
Landed in SLO 
I'm excited to be roasted by Poly Reps tonight . I hope they found enough stories to \torture\ " me with . " 
Got an offer with Lockheed < PROPFIRST > - woot ! 
Only less than a week , I will be walking in my graduation ceremony and shaking hands with President Baker . 
This is my feeling : when you find a wonderful job and being led to believe that you will get the wonderful job , and then finding out that you didn't get the wonderful job -- can absolutely crush you . 
Just remember < PROPFIRST > Vu : God has a reason for everything when you faith in his plan . 
Off to San < PROPFIRST > Obispo , California 
I'm off to my Fall Commencement Graduation Ceremony to the City of San < PROPFIRST > Obispo , California .

Please give me the < PROPFEMALE > while finding opportunities in this harsh economy . 
Does it sound immature when one wants the whole health care < PROPMALE > read out loud to stall the vote ? 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas ! Ad majorem dei gloriam inque hominum salutem . 
H A P P Y N E W Y E A R ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
God , I'm getting near to exhaustion after 60 interviews . Although I thank you for the offers received , I ask of you on what am I doing to fail these interviews ? Behavioral interviews come to me easily but why do I struggle so much on technical interviews . Why has no one notice my potential to become a leader and a contributor . 
Whoa , an earthquake .

Avenue Q was so freaking awesome to watch -- and absolutely funny . ( Do not bring anyone under the age of 13 -- we had a couple and they left after the first act ) 
Just watched \Alvin and the Chipmunks : The Squeakquel\ " which was good for my mom and decent for me . I would give it a C+ even though I grew up with the cartoon and music . "

One of the best compliments that you can get from your co-workers is them affirming that you are nice and genuine person . :-) 
Why is a cross-breed between an Asian and a White equate to someone sometimes a bit beautiful ?
