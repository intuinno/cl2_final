I'm unable to fall asleep due to a sudden brainstorm raging in his head . We're talking a category 5 idea hurricane here . This is going to wreck some poorly prepared communities in the gulf of my conscious . Hopefully they can evacuate the area before it reaches the mainland of my mind . Mindland if you will . \ 
I feel I may have taken that metaphor to irresponsible lengths . 
Okay the brainstorm finally hit and it looks like Hurricane Wakeful burst the levees and has flooded at least 20 of the 40 winks I was trying to take . The Kanye West of dreams was just on TV and said < PROPFIRST > Bush doesn't care about sleep .

9 more days till Mahvel . \ 
Where's the leak ? 
After the failure that was the BestBuy list being posted days before they actually got them , I'm going to go out and check one for the MvC3 demo now . 
We found farmed links to MvC3 . Realized the 360 I would mod is dead , and that I don't know how to open up the new ones yet . Also I don't want to brick it . If anyone wants the links PM me . Except for those with access . You should know where to find it . 
BECAUSE I CAN'T SEEM TO STOP POSTING ABOUT MVC3 : Best Buy updated the website to say they'd have the demos set up \from the 13th to the 5th\ " rather than \ " now to the 5th\ " . Wooo playing it one and a half days early . " 
With every run though arcade mode I can feel myself getting worse at MvC3 . At this rate I'm going to have to relearn how buttons work when I'm done . 
Seriously don't get why people are going nuts over Skyrim . Then again I never got the appeal of Oblivion either .
