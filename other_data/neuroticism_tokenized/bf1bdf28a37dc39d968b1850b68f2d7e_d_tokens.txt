is feeling a -little- bit better , and thanks her bb for helping get her that way ! ** spoiillleeeddd ** 
is hating the hot , HOT weather and likes to tell people how ** SOMEONE ** forgot to pick her up last night for about fifteen minutes ~ 
Why does the whole world rest on me ? 
is plugging her short story : Someone read it and tell me if I really ought to quit writing forever . XD Go to lunantic.livejournal.com or skitchan.deviantart.com and go to either link labeled : ' Bathroom ' . 
is in < PROPFEMALE > after 11 hours and can finally relax . Busch Gardens here we come ~ :DD 
doesn't want to drive to Ohio tomorrow . Having too much fun and wishes she didn't need to work anymore . 
wishes she didn't have money problems . It interferes with sleep . Reno comes back on the 30th , won't she be surprised who else moved in ?! xD 
Hating that one car is out of comission , now -- 3 days and it is already causing some problems -- nevermind that there are still 3 cars to be used . Zombieland was a funny movie -- Go see it . :D 2012 is trying to cause controversy and some wierdo game me a mini-testament . I'M NOT OF YOUR RELIGION ! 
Samhain is coming up ( Oct 31st . ) I'll be in Dearborn , MI so I can't do much by way of ritual or anything , so I hope to improvise sometime that night . Then it's off to a Concert on Nov . 2nd ! 
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu . 
sitting at < PROPFEMALE>'s Best Value Inn , waiting her turn to dress up and hit the Hyatt until 4AM . 
back at the hotel early tonight . Not much going on until tomorrow . Photoshoot session for all Final Fantasy characters ! :D 
is still VERY tired after spending most of her night laughing . xD Happy Halloween/Samhain . 
wonders what IT is ... LOUDLY DOES SHE WONDER ABOUT IT ! 
says working on NYE Is stupid , but not so bad when you're given homemade chocolate chip cookies . :-) 
saw the ugliest panty shot ever on Assassin's Creed I ... Did they even have panties ? ... ... ... YAY GLITCHES ! 
Please put this on your status if you or someone you know is gay . A wish for 2010 is that people will understand that being gay is not a disease . People who are gay are not looking for a cure but for ACCEPTANCE and EQUAL RIGHTS .... 93% won't Copy and Paste this . Will you make this your status for at least one hour ? 
found a GIANT box of chocolates , a charm bracelet , a glittery card , and a potted plant of roses sitting at the top of the stairs when she came home from work . YES , it's love . <333 Love you , Tesla . 
loved spending V-Day with you , baby . It was wonderful . <333 
thinks work 6-3am is the worst possible thing to have come into her life . FML . 
Thinks it's funny that girls ages 18-24 are angry drivers . 
has strange , random urges to choke people when they ask her girlfriend if she is single yet . * SIGH * 
thinks that last night was just the Lord and Lady's way of telling her to pull her shit together . No gas , dead phone , dead car battery AND I have to work until 2AM ? Life hates me . 
is glad for a day off . Seriously . RAWR . 
food safety audit today : we passed . Barely . Got home just in time for bb to go to work . Home alone until 10 . Baths sound good : No show times for < PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland late night . Have to wait for tomorrow ? :( ALSO : 9-9 and 8:30 -8 ? No thanks . :( 
finds you inexplicably ugly . Whatever did I do wrong to have someone as horrible as you cross my life ? It was good until you came along . 
has methodically , albeit unsuccessfully , tried to dye , strip , strip again , and dye again her hair all in one night . =) Was trying for black hair with \Raspberry Kamikaze\ " tips . xD Damn bleach didn't do much the first time ; but left it in longer the second time and it mellowed to ... brown ? WHUT ? " 
believes that out of 20 houses on < PROPFEMALE > Avenue , 40-odd cars on said street , and the countless visitors to said houses that park their cars ILLEGALLY on the same street , nosy neighbors just had to report the one car that wasn't movable . O'Mali's . 
has decided that she'll read the FML list before going to work each day to make her feel better about dealing with customers . 
is amused that her DeviantArt decided that for April Fools Day they would change all user pics to either : Twilight \Teams\ " or Lady Gag-Me . " 
can't wait to go to the Zoo on Monday ! :D Attendees are : * ME * Tesla/O'Mali * < PROPFEMALE > * < PROPFEMALE > * < PROPFEMALE > * < PROPFIRST > ~ I'm excited : Never gone before . Can't wait ! 
:( FACEBOOK WONT LET ME UPLOAD MY PICS ! 
had begun thinking about the past ; where nobody could get along with eachother . Hopefully the past is the past and we all actually get along . 
\Buzama\ " na furumai ga oniai daro ? > : K " 
can't believe she came home last night and jumped online and was completely OBLIVIOUS to the fact there was a GIANT , FAT , UGLY BUMBLEBEE CRAWLING AROUND NEXT TO HER FOOT ! I hate them . Hate . Them . 
waiting for Tesla to get online at school : D: Not looking forward to this closing week . 
can't fucking deny it anymore . After 6 years of fighting it , I've lost the war . I fucking like My Chemical Romance and The Used . FML ? I wish I could say so . :o

just lost her glasses out of a moving vehicle going 65 mph down a state route . Looking for them when you already have bad eyesight isn't going to help . Time to get a new pair . * sob * 
is sunburnt . 
would like to spend time with her baby , if only work would let her . :( 
spent $5 playing the Wal*Mart claw machine to win a Domo , only to be bought by the Welcome Lady to give to the Salon Lady instead . :D 
finished her first night closing by herself ; left at 1:30 ; it only took 30 minutes to finish up ! We were pretty slow come the end , so that was good . Hope it's just as good the next few times around : Gotta make < PROPFIRST > proud . xD Gotta be back in at noon , so going to bed . 
off work early ; time for the two day vacation ! 
tryin ' to pass the time until O'Mali gets home . :( Enjoying my two days off , but not when there's no one to share it with . 
has itchy eyes again . I can't stop rubbing them ! No , my contacts aren't even in . UGH . 
GRANDMOTHER : Do you remember the kanji wall boards you gave me a couple years ago ? The red ones ? Well , one mysterious disappeared recently , and I haven't been able to find it . I discovered it last night when I was leaving the bedroom . It decided to say ' hello ' by cutting open the bottom of my foot . xD Ow . Hurts to walk on it . Thought you should know : You give dangerous gifts . 
has her first day off today and the PS3 is on its way via UPS ! Ohhh , pleeeaaaassse arrive soon ! 
just talked to a co-worker about how we first had too many people working shift tonight , and now sounds like there won't be enough . Wasn't last night a big enough hassle ? Why does it have to be tonight , too ??? 
likes it on the floor . xD 
just decided to make a 6 hour trip to Pontiac , MI due to a BEST 2 OUT OF 3 coin flip . :) Spontaneous trips and life decisions are the ones you'll never forget ; and it's best to never regret , either . RENO , HERE WE COME . :D 
fails at bleaching ... ._. 
had to comfort a co-worker in the middle of a tornado watch . Nope , never been in one ; and it happens ON MY SHIFT . *_* -siiiiiiiiggghhhhh- Glad it didn't hit US , but switched directions 15 minutes away . 
is seriously in a ' Screw You ' mode . Don't put your nose in my business when you don't know the story . 
wishes all the congoes at Colossal good luck ; don't go to Oz . 
has decided for her birthday she wants a hard copy of all The GazettE's singles . :D 
likes her new contacts . 8D 
is now going to bed . At 8am . After closing at 1:30 and staying up all night with Tesla < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > Grigsby . Work at 3 . 8D

Happy Father's Day ! I have a cat ! :D A pretty . 8 week old tabby named Reila . Pics to be added . :) 
doesn't want to work tonight . Especially with someone who is mad at her for doing her job . BTW , it's no one's business but who worked that night . 
had her car battery die last night after closing ; had to push the car to the gas station , tried to get it jumped , walk to Wal*Mart for a new battery , then find out I have a loose terminal . 
is thinking Central Park next year would be a good venue . Think it's possible ? 
is planning for her trip to Otacon . :D Got the vacation days off , finishing the costume , and now booking the hotel . 
is trying to type with a ADD kitten on her shoulders tryingto attack her fingers as they move on the keyboard . :D 
is seriously done with her workplace after last night . I'm nobody's scapegoat . 
realized that acting like the girl from ' The Ring ' gets heavy laundry detergent bottles thrown on your fingers and O'Mali's face smashed in with a Christmas tree branch . ROFLMAO . 
just saw < PROPFIRST > Grigsby win $100 on a $5 lottery ticket from behind the counter while she lost on the very same ticket in a machine by the front door . FML . xD 
is about to work 4-1 with 12 other people on shift tonight : Her new position ? Backups for the first half of the resturant . One other person gets the other side ; 6 people on line , 2 in drive thru and 2 on front counter . WTF . 
' s feets hurt . :( 
thinks last night sucked . 2:45 ? REALLY , EVERYONE ? Schedule a one o'clock person next time , kthx . I'm not dealing with a second round of bullshit Wednesday . 
wishes she could help lift Tesla < PROPFIRST>'s spirits , without going on to call said fiancee's mother and let her know exactly what I think . She's your daughter , this is really happening , we're really in love , and we know what we're getting into . Be happy for her . 
So , everyone that worked Sunday night is still talking shit . I only took a 30 minutes break because I wanted a cigarette . Why didn't you tell me you needed help ? You weren't that busy . Don't be pissed off because you thought I was on the clock . We weren't busy ; we had no church rush , and labor was high . I'm entitled to do something about it . Don't be an asshole because you wanted to be macho . \ 
\ 
Serously , fuck you . 
is still sore after the accident . Keep seeing the grill on the truck \ 
shoving us the wrong way ... took my meds , time to lay down . :( 
would like to post this for her family and friends to see . I got off extremely lucky to have people who don't judge me for my lifestyle and that accept the person I've come to know and < PROPFEMALE > very much . Thank for for accepting me , and for accepting her as part of my life . I've never been happier . 
has just bought her own pair of drumsticks . :) I'm prepared to start learning . No drum set until I get a bigger place , though . :-( 6 hour shift tonight instead of an 8 hour day shift ; someone I don't like just quit and I got my sweet tea ! Life sure is good . 
just got home from work . =/ Two 10 hour shifts in a row starting tomorrow : 12-10 The ONLY upside ? I don't have to close another night shift until August 2nd . ;) Otacon coming up in 6 days ! 
has found two cars she most definitely has her eye on . I just hope the insurance company can help get that extra $$$ so I can get a new vehicle ! D: I hope this doesn't take too long . 
now has to appear in court to testify against the guy that caused the accident . Depending on what happens and his driving record , he might lose his CDL license . Got hospital < PROPMALE > today , too : They get to pay $3000 . :D 
Leave one memorythat you and I had together . It doesn't matter if you \ 
knew me a littleor a lot , anything you remember . Don't send a message , \ 
leave a commenton here . Next , re-post this as your status and see how \

Sooo much stuffff to doooooo . :(

OMGOMG KANON FROM AN CAFE IS HERE IM SITTING IN HIS PANEL OMFG !

May not work all the way to close , if < PROPFIRST > has her way ... just as well : I'm exhausted ! Got work 10-6 tomorrow , though . 
Doesn't have rent money . I'm so screwed . 
talked to the landlord about sending the money late due to circumstances . He agreed with a $30 charge , and as long as next month's on time . O'Mali's bank might not get charged $150 for overdrafting , I hope I put the $$ in on time . =/ 
Was too late putting $$ in the bank ... :-( May be short still for rent . 
Is thinking about plotting some srs revenge on someone for paming jewelry . < PROPFEMALE>'s a bitch , sweetie .

better be loved by her workplace . 1 . ) Not calling to tell me there's no meeting and having me show up ; isn't nice . 2 . ) Waiting forever only to find out no one is coming to open the store and having to do it yourself , isn't nice , either . Especially when you don't know how .
