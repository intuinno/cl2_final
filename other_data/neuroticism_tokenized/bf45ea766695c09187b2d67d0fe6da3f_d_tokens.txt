wonders if anyone else ever feels totally alone , even in a crowded room ... or is it just me ? 
wonders why Im only cool when I can help someone with something ? And why I cant count on the people I should be able to count on ? Im about to lock myself in the house and become a hermit for awhile ..... Its easier just to stay at home and not deal with people sometimes ....

\The most basic and powerful way to connect to another person is to listen . Just listen . Perhaps the most important thing we ever give each other is our attention ... A loving silence often has far more power to heal and to connect than the most well-intentioned words . \"" 
I feel wonderful because I see The love light in your eyes ... And the wonder of it all , Is that you just don't realize how much I love you ...

I hope my daughter gets well soon ! I hate seeing her so miserable and not being able to help her feel better .... 
If there is to be peace in the nations , there must be peace in the cities . If there is to be peace in the cities , there must be peace between neighbors .

Happy New Year ! I wish you all happiness , good health , lots of laughter , serenity , fun times , and love ! Thanks for being there for us during the past year ! I truly am thankful for so many things in my life , especially my daughter and my family . Whats YOUR New Years Resolution for 2011 ? Id love to know !!! 
Just to let everyone know , Millcreek Schools already have a 2 hour delay tomorrow .... 
My new years resolutions are to be the best mom I can be , to do things everyday to better myself as a person , to learn to still be kindhearted and help people but without being taken advantage of , to love with all my heart , to laugh til I cry , to forgive easier , and to < PROPFEMALE > every moment my daughter smiles at me with her eyes ... 
I've dealt with my ghosts and I've faced all my demons . Finally content with a past I regret . I've found you find strength in your moments of weakness . For once I'm at peace with myself . I've been burdened with blame , trapped in the past for too long ... 
I've lived in this place and I know all the faces . Each one is different but they're always the same . They mean me no harm but it's time that I face it . They'll never allow me to change . But I never dreamed home would end up where I don't belong ... 
At last I can see life has been patiently waiting for me . And I know there's no guarantees , but I'm not alone . There comes a time in everyone's life , When all you can see are the years passing by . And I have made up my mind that those days are gone .... 
I sold what I could and packed what I couldn't . Stopped to fill up on my way out of town . I've loved like I should but lived like I shouldn't . I had to lose everything to find out . Maybe forgiveness will find me somewhere down this road . I'm movin ' on .... 
has to stay up all night for a sleep deprivation test and an EEG in the morning . This should be fun ! lol I hope some of you will be around in the wee hours of the morning to keep me company ! Until then , Im off to < PROPFEMALE > out with my mom . Shes awesome !! =) <3 
has been up for 24 hours now with no caffeine . I have to get a sleep deprivation test and an EEG done at 8am . Maybe they will finally figure out whats up with this sleep disorder they say I have but then they cant diagnose . This will be my 4th sleep clinic since June .... 
just got back from my sleep deprivation test and my EEG at St Vs . Ive been awake for over 30 hours ( except for a 20 minutes nap during the sleep test ) and Im exhausted ! My big comfy bed , smooth new sheets , and comforter are calling my name ! ZZzzzz .... 
is so happy with how things are going in life ! I <3 my family and friends ! Im so blessed ! <3 =)

Ever have a nightmare then wake up and youre not sure if it really happened or not ? Then you cant shake that eerie feeling all day ? Anyone ??? 
Ever been in a room full of people and still feel completely alone ? Even if they are people you know and are close to ? Anyone ??? 
? Sometimes when your heart is broken , its better to leave the pieces on the floor then to try to sit there and risk the < PROPMALE > of hurting yourself trying to fix it ... ? 
<3 Life is too short to wake up with regrets . ? Love the people who treat you right . ? Forget about the ones who don't . Believe everything happens for a reason . If you get a second < PROPMALE > , grab it with both hands . <3 If it changes your life , let it . Nobody said life would be easy . They just promised it would be worth it . Post this to your wall if you agree <3

Boyfriends are overrated . 
If you have one kind thing you can say about me , please do so now . I really could use some cheering up ........ =( 
Ive been totally fucked over by many ppl in my life . People I shouldve been able to trust . Im going back to being a total agoraphobic and Im staying single . I dont want to be around people at all . They just fuck you over in the end anyways ..... I cant trust a soul . No one cares about anything but themselves these days and I dont want any part of it ......... 
I just removed almost 200 people from my friends list , so if youre still here then youre still on it . You are on my list because I have faith you are a true friend . Im done with fake people ... 
Ive decided to delete my Facebook account totally so goodbye yall . This will be deleted in 24 hours so if you have anything left to say to me , you better do it before then . 
Well Ive deleted another 230 people from my friends list . If youre reading this , you are still on it . Im still planning on cancelling my account by Wednesday if this highschool bullshit doesnt stop . Ive deleted over 400 ppl today . Lets see who else will have to go ..... 
PLEASE watch the youtube video posted on my wall . Id really appreciate it . Maybe it will help you understand me better . Im opening up my soul here and its not easy to open up yourself like that so please just do this one thing for me ..... ? 
Now that Ive told everyone what Ive been thinking and feeling , I feel MUCH better . I shouldnt have to put a mask on for anyone and Im no longer going to . I am who I am and you either accept me or you dont . My life goes on with or without you , but Id LOVE to have you come along for the ride . <3 
Lets support our POLICE OFFICERS ! If you support our POLICE OFFICERS , PLEASE post this on your status and leave it up for ONE HOUR . There should be NO EXCUSES from anyone ! This should appear in everyone's status !!!!! GOD BLESS OUR POLICE OFFICERS ! 
I want to apologize to anyone I have offended . I was very angry at a few \friends\ " that werent real friends . I know that doesnt excuse my behavior but Im only human . I had to be honest with those people and get them out of my life . You are still on my list so that means you mean a lot to me . I hope you will forgive me . ? " 
Happy hump day , everyone ! Dont forget its Random Act of Kindness Day ! I think we should make it a weekly ritual ... its a great way to get through the middle of the week ! Get out there and show some compassion and love ! <3 
My daughters brother spent the night last night . They had a great time ! They are great kids ! My exhusband has been staying here so its great to see them both with their dad ! ( I know it sounds odd .. lol .. but he and I are good friends and have a great parenting relationship . ) 
Its the song that never ends ... It just goes on and on my friends ... 
Remember , it takes lots of different kinds of flowers to make a bouquet . <3

I thought of you today , but that is nothing new . I thought about you yesterday , and days before that too . I think of you in silence , I often speak your name . All I have are memories and a picture in a frame . Your memory is a keepsake , with which I'll never part . God has you in his keeping , I have you in my heart . <3

Finish this sentence .... Before I found Facebook , I spent my freetime ___________ . ( Can you remember ? lol ) 
You all mean the world to me and Im blessed to have you in my life ... even if you are far away , I havent seen you in forever , and this is the only contact we have . You all are on my Facebook List for a reason . Always know you are special to me and I love ya lots . ? 
These last few months have been a roller coaster for me and many of you have made me laugh , inspired me , given me your shoulder to < PROPFEMALE > on , and/or kicked me in the ass when I needed it and I wanted to thank you for that . Love you ! <3 =) 
Just wondering .... If you knew it was your last meal , what would you have ? 
If you could go back to one day of your life and re-live it , but not change a thing ... what day would you re-live ?

Im a single mom with a mental disability that does not get child support . I dont qualify for food stamps or assistance in any way . I stretch what I have as far as I can . My meds alone cost about $250 a month . I really wish some people would try to understand that I do the best that I can so please dont judge me unless youve walked a mile in my shoes . 
More great news ! I lost my drug plan so now my monthly meds < PROPMALE > went from $250 a month to about $850 ..... What do you do when its dangerous to stop taking your meds ? I feel so stuck but I know if I think positively I will find some program to help . 
My quiz result .... How Naughty Are You ? Result : A Good Mix Of Naughty & Nice You just wait for the right time . It could be while single or committed . You love sex but sometimes you like to make love . Your the perfect kind of naughty . hehe Go me ! =) ~ 
I need a long , relaxing massage by someone with strong hands like nobodys business ! Im hurting so bad ! Any takers ? I would be in deep gratitude ! 
I fell down the stairs twice last night and Im hurting so bad ! I even have a brush burn on my face and bruises all over my body , especially my legs . Its a bright , bright sunshiney day ! lol

When someone you know is hurting , take the time to comfort them so they know you care . Life is too short not to touch as many lives as possible . <3 =)

October is Anti-Bullying Awareness Month . You can show your support by wearing blue , sharing your stories and ideas of how you are dealing with or have overcome bullying . If you are being bullied , don't hold it inside . You need to talk to someone you trust to figure out a way to deal with the bully . It's not an easy thing to overcome . But you must remember that you are not alone . Be well . 
Im blessed to have the most awesome daughter and family in the world ! ?

What ! Friends listen to Endless Love in the dark !!! 
is wondering : Do doggies ever do it people-style ? 
is sad for her daughter because some people arent allowing their child to come to < PROPFEMALE > s bday . She said its because of her father . ( He is in prison for kidnapping < PROPFEMALE>'s stepmom this summer . ) I have ALWAYS continued to keep < PROPFEMALE > safe . We didnt have anything to do with his and his estranged wifes kidnapping case at all . Its hard when your daughter is sad over something like this . Breaks my heart . 
I'm not who I was , I'm not who I'm going to be , I'm just me and I'm okay with that for today . Each and everyday I become more of who I want to be .

Its awesome because it betters my life as well is my daughters . Live ! Love ! Pray ! =) 
Please pray for my daughter and I that we get justice and also for me to be able to be strong in the courtroom tomorrow .

Also pray for my daughters other family because I know that they must be going through more stressful times than what were going through . Amen . And thanks . ? =) 
Please pray that I have strength and low anxiety while in court today . I really dont even want to see that @sshole again but he has the right to face his accuser so that doesnt give me much choice . Please also pray that he gets everything thats coming to him with all his charges with us and < PROPFEMALE>'s other family as well . Theyve been through more than we have . Keep them in your prayers . God bless them . Amen . <3 
Well , he didnt make his public defender aware of this hearing so it was all a big waste of time for me . They had postpone his hearing because of his \mistake\ " . He really knows how to works the systems all right . Although at least he got a nice bus ride to and from Albion Prison for the day . I truly think he did it on purpose . He knew exactly what he was doing .... Grrr ! " 
Let's just see how forthcoming my Facebook friends are ..... PLEASE Leave a 1 word comment that you think best describes me using the THIRD letter of YOUR first name . No repeats . It can only be 1 word .

Why is it that some people cant understand that men and women can be strickly friends without ulterior motives ? Did anyone ever consider that both people may just want to remain single ? Or maybe they are happy with the friendship and dont want it to change ? Im so sick of going out with a male friends and people trying to hook us up or make something out of nothing . Grrrr !

While you HUMILIATE , OFFEND and INSULT her , there’s a man flirting with her and reminding her how wonderful she is . While you HURTyour woman , there’s a man wishing he could make love to her . While you make your woman CRY there’s a man stealing smiles from her . Post this on your wall if you’re against Domestic Violence !

One of the hardest things in life is having words in your heart that you can't utter . ~ < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Jones

QUESTION - If you were president for a day and could pass or change ONE law permanently ... without any backlashing from anyone , what law would you choose and why ? 
QUESTION - What is the cheesiest pickup line have you heard ?? 
When you call a girl hot your looking at her face , when you call a girl sexy your looking at her body , when you call a girl beautiful , your looking at her heart ? 
Whatever u give a woman , she will make it greater . Give her sperm , she will give u a baby . Give her a house , she will give u a home . Give her groceries , she will give u a meal . Give her a smile and she will give u her heart . She multiplies and enlarges what she is given . So if u give her crap be ready to receive a ton of shit . Post it on your wall if u agree . Hope 2 see every girl on my friend list repost this !! 
Its been a really hard time for me . Sometimes I get really down and need to breathe . If Im not on FB for a few days , dont be worried .

LET'S SEE HOW MANY < PROPFEMALE > NS WILL RE-POST THIS & NOT CARE ABOUT OFFENDING SOMEONE !!! 
If I don't wear makeup , I'm unattractive . If I like wearing sweats & t-shirts , I'm a slob . If I say what I think , I'm a bitch . If I cry , I'm a drama < PROPFEMALE > . If I have guy friends , I'm a slut . If I stand up for myself , I'm mouthy . If I speak the truth , I am abrasive . Seems like you can't do anything now a days without being labeled ... so go ahead and label me , see if I give a shit . Repost if you're proud of who you are . 
Many things in life will catch your eye ... but few things will ever catch your heart . So when they do , pursue them . xoxox

Will all this Facebook/MySpace/Twitter/Text stuff be the end of us ? I truly cant believe what some people say in texts or online . Some people need to learn you CANT take back hurtful , spiteful things that you type and then send . Remember , there IS a REAL person on the other end !

The stigma of mental illness usually hurts the person suffering as much as the mental illness itself . Be kind . Hug . Check on them . They need to know you care . Please dont judge a person just by a DX . I mean , would you shun someone that has diabetes ?? An imbalance in your body is the same no matter what area of the body it affects . Repost if you or someone you loves suffers from a mental illness . 
Insomnia and loneliness are not a wonderful combination ....

Its time for me to clear out my FB list . Im taking some ppl off because of how theyve treated me badly and spread untrue rumors about me . Im sick and tired of fake , hypocritical ppl .

Im beyond bored . Does someone want to come visit for a little while ? Or at least get me smiling ?? Cyber hugs just arent doing the trick .... 
Only love lets us see normal things in an extraordinary way .

There comes a point in your life when FUN no longer means bar hopping , clubbing , being out til 4am or drinking too much . It means movies , family dinners , kids athletic events , bedtime stories , and 9pm bedtimes . Becoming a parent doesn't change you , it makes you realize that the little people you created deserve the best of your free time ! Re-post this if you are PROUD to be a parent and LOVE your \boring\ " life ! " 
You cannot control the world outside , but you can choose what you will bring into yourself . If you do not see anything of value in your life , begin by finding one thing of beauty every day until it becomes a habit . \

I'm sorry I don't have glamorous hair , perfect skin , the straightest teeth , or the best body . I'm sorry I don't doll myself up all the time and that I wear those baggy shirts around the house . I'm sorry that I like to eat junk food once in a while and I'm sorry that I'm not a fitness guru . I'm sorry I'm not like some of the other girls . But the funniest thing of all , is that I'm not sorry at all ... 
The original slinky + escalator = hours of entertainment ! ( Im a cheap date I guess ! lolz )

Dear Congress , Last year I mismanaged my funds and this year we cannot decide on a budget .

Thank you very much for setting an example we can all follow . Repost if you agree !

As most of you know from the news , my daughter and I have just gone through a year of crap with her dad ( my exhusband ) . I would like some input ... let me know if you think making her go to a counselor would do more harm than damage or if letting this just fade back into a memory would be best . Shes claims he is no longer her dad ... which could change . Any ideas on how to handle this ?? Please help !!!

I woke up with my back still KILLING me and the pain meds my doctor gave me arent helping much . The pain seems to be getting worse instead of getting better . Its frustrating as hell ! But if that is my only problem right now then Im pretty blessed . MAYBE if I would stay off my feet for a couple days and not push myself , it would heal faster . Its been a busy week though ! Send healing thoughts my way please ! 
Relaxing today . Enough said . 
My daughter and I have been through hell this past year and now that theres been some closure , Ive had time to think about things . I can now see who my real friends are and who dont give a damn . But the best thing thats come from all this is that my daughter and I are closer than ever . I can see some positiveness even in bad times . Live ! Love ! Pray ! xoxox <3

Someone please entertain me before I lose my mind again ! 
I'm so happy . Cause today I found my friends . \ 
They're in my head . I'm so ugly . But that's ok . \ 
' Cause so are you . We've broke our mirrors . \ 
Sunday morning . Is everyday for all I care . \ 
And I'm not scared . Light my candles . In a daze cause I've found God ... 
Skin against skin blood and bone \ 
You're all by yourself but you're not alone \ 
You wanted in now you're here \ 
Driven by hate consumed by fear ... 
I've been around this world , Yet I see no end . \ 
All shall fade to black again and again . \ 
This storm that's broken me , my only friend . \ 
Yeah .... 
what I've felt\ 
what I've known\ 
never shined through in what I've shown\ 
never free\ 
never me\ 
so I dub thee unforgiven ... 
Well I guess , I should stick up for myself\ 
But I really think it's better this way\ 
The more you suffer\ 
The more it shows you really care , right ? Yeah ! 
And now for a message from our sponsers .... 
Happy Palm Sunday ! Enjoy your day ! xoxox <3

Please take the time to say a prayer for Baby Wellman and her family . She was born yesterday with complications and they had to fly her to a Pittsburgh hospital .

Hmm ... I just noticed something . I don't see anyone from Haiti , Japan , or anywhere else rushing over here to help us clean up the tornado damage . No out-of-country relief efforts , no one flying in foreign food or help . Coincidence ? I think not . Maybe we should take a hint and focus on fixing our own country before we rush out to help everyone else . Most of whom , never asked for it ! Repost if you agree .

Now I lay me down to sleep ... one less terrorist this world does keep ... with all my heart I give my thanks ... to those in uniform regardless of ranks ... you serve our country and serve it well ... with humble hearts your stories tell ... so as I rest my weary eyes ... while freedom rings our flag still flies ... you give your all , do what you must ... with God we live and God we trust .... Amen ! 
PLEASE READ AND REPOST !!! WARNING : there is a video circulating around Facebook of a BBC video of the killing of Osama Bin Laden , supposedly made by US troops . It is a Virus !!!!! Spread the news because it's circulating fast !!!! 
It makes me nervous that everyone is celebrating Bin Laden's death . Dont get me wrong - I know a lot of people were lost and their loved ones still hurt over it . And then theres all the deaths that happened since - all the military and civilians killed . That proves that hate just multiplies . They will take revenge as we did and it creates a vicious circle . Will it EVER stop or will this be the beginning of the end ?? 
It's been said that everlasting friends go long periods of time without speaking and never question the friendship . These friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been , or how far away they live and they don't hold grudges . They understand that life is busy and you will ALWAYS love them . Repost if you have at least 1 of these friends ! 
Happiness is a choice ! It is a choice we make in our hearts . You can < PROPFEMALE > on to old hurts and be miserable or you can make a choice to let it go ... Choose to be happy !! xoxox <3 
As I posted a few days ago , my daughter just did the 30 Hour Famine with our church , which raises money for hungry children . She can still turn in donations , so please inbox me if you want to be a sponsor for her . Even $5 would be great . Every $30 she raises feeds a hungry child for a month . We would SO appreciate it ! Thanks all ! =)
