laughed heartily tonight . hallelujah . 
is contradictory 
nothing is more powerful than beauty in a wicked world 
I don't need proof that this is wrong when the darkness of it resounds in my heart like an earthquake . No book can secure this truth , nor can any person defend it in the way that my heart feels it . But know this - my heart is stronger than the darkness . L 
Say you want to live in love and kindness every day . Say you know the meaning of love . See every person that you meet as every You and every Me . Then I'll know you feel the rhythm of love . <3 
can't help wilting sometimes 
its such a feeling that my heart can't hide <3 
did something kinda quirky and out of character for the first time tonight 
wishes the sun would shine a little brighter 
Livin ' life and livin ' free . That's how its supposed to be . 
oh wretched pillow ..... stealing my love ..... I will destroy thee .......

bubble wrap ..... 
I'm < PROPFEMALE > of Attention to Detail 
when you assume you make an ' ass ' out of you ' u ' and ' me ' 
needs to create a new word to describe how she's feeling .... 
hello paycheck ;) 
my oh my , how my blood boils its sweetest for you , strips me down bear and puts me into my favorite mood 
< PROPFIRST > Mayer has the right idea - say what you mean to say . 
is having withdrawls 
quick judgments , preconceived notions , assumptions , etc = epic failures 
once upon a time .... 
changed her mind . running on the oly track sounds better . 
swody . lack of vehicle . hungry for fun . i'll kiss you later . sigh . 
mechanical pencils , Chips Ahoy cookies and < PROPFEMALE > winking notebooks . these are a few of my favorite things . 
just performed her 1st ever center french braid on herself , BY HERSELF ( no help from a mirror or other party ) , woooooo ! and she is pleased because it looks grrrrrrreat !!! ( < PROPFEMALE > also thinks that she might need to set some rules ..... like only ONE status update/day ..... ) 
:D ....... that's all 
Those who love themselves are enslaved to no one else and they don't have to cover their eyes , they don't have to compromise

why react when you can act and produce reaction ? 
just might explode 
LOOOOUUUUD NOISES !!! 
maybe the best solution is no solution at all 
I am an endangered species but I sing no victim's song . I am a woman . I am an artist . I know where my voice belongs . I know where my soul belongs . I know where I belong .

the only way out is up 
come on life . turn off the crapper . 
Wishes she could have known some of the things she knows now a little sooner so as to avoid certain complications , but supposes that if she always knew what she would know then she'd never experience anything - achieving a lack of complications hand in hand with a severe lack of living . Damn .

No one is perfect . It's what makes us interesting and it's what makes us human . Then again , is there anything wrong with the pursuit of perfection ? If you keep it in perspective , it can be a healthy goal . As long as you accept that you'll never truly reach perfection , you can continually strive for it and always be changing for the better . Right ? 
Dear stomach , please stop hurting . Thanks ! 
seriously feels shitty . wtf ? 
feeling better and feeling hopeful :)
