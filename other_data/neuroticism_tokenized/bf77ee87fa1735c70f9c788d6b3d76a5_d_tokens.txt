When you think outside the box you can never be boxed in . 
To everyone on the highways , especially 55 , if you in the fast < PROPFIRST > doing 60 in a 65 that's me on ya ass . MOVE OUT THE FUCKING WAY . It's called the fast < PROPFIRST > for a reason .

Still bumping the TEFLON < PROPMALE > non stop . Ricky Rozay went in on this album . Just pop it in , spark one up and cruise . 
Living in my own shadow , as well as the light that creates it . 
Sex is like math . You add the bed , subtract the clothes , divide the legs , leave your solution and pray you don't multiply .
