Oh , how I find every subtle thing screams your name . It reminds me of places of times we shared . Couldn't live locked in these memories . Now I'm chained to my thoughts again . 
Through the Trees- Low Shoulder </3

You always help me through the day , and it makes everything okay <3

Tidal waves they rip right through me . Tears from eyes worn cold and sad . Pick me up now , I need you so bad . <3

I will be chasing your starlight until the end of my life ... you electrify my life ... ill never let you go .

ill be missing you <3 
<3 Nobody has ever made me feel this way before <3 
where are you when i need you the most ... <3 
In a crowded room ... I still feel so alone without you ... 
She was the sun shining upon the tomb of your hopes and dreams so frail . He was the < PROPFEMALE > painting you with it's glow so vulnerable and pale . 
\I promise to love you every moment of forever \"" 
When the night falls in around me , I dont think ill make it through . Ill use your light to guide the way , Cause all I think about is you . 
goin to my mommys ! leavin round 11am . im happy <3 
So many days I've been blind . I want to stop and rewind . <3 
these endless thoughts drip from my soul .. every single word secretly paints a fairytale of when we will melt into one .. 
Absence makes the heart grow fonder . 
.. now your voice is haunting me , just out of reach , it buries me .. <3 
I feel empty .. youre pushing me away .. </3 
remember me . 
Beany loves Mookie <3 pahahaha XD 
Im busy mending broken pieces of the life I had before .. 
Love kills , romance is dead and I don't even trust myself .. but I love you . And you can pull my wings apart and pin me down under glass until the end of days if it can help you \ 
discover that we share the same pain . <3 
FUCK . 
I wrestled a bear once ..

XD 
I MISS YOU < PROPFEMALE > GRACE RICHARDS ! <3 x 
you can make your own decisions , you can make your own mistakes . ill live and let die all the promises you made . but if you lie another time , itll be a lie thats too late . </3 
im trying to get to you . but time isnt on my side . if the truth is the worst i can do ... then i guess that i have lied .. </3 
daggers speak louder than words </3 
heres my heart .. you can take it . just dont break it .. or my world will fall apart </3 
tidal waves , they rip right through me .. tears from eyes worn cold and sad .. pick me up now , i need you so bad .. </3 
i have lost all hope of being normal once again . i will be a slave to you until the bitter end . even if its a hundred years before you change your mind . i will be here waiting until the end of time . 
if only he knew about the world without the bullshit and the lies . we couldve saved him , they couldve saved me . but instead im here drowning in my own fucking mind . and ill be damned if youre the death of me . 
these cuts that ive caused are never too deep to heal . peel back the bandage , see a scar from countless careless things . 
were the last words that i wrote for you , enough to tell you that , in my death the light that shown through my painful darkness was a blinding vision of your eternal smile ? 
its a silent murder . its a grave that sings your song . its a quiet failure . its the one that makes you strong . we are heading down a long empty road . we pass lost souls blinded by the cold . watch the fire burn out . watch the curtains slowly close . waiting on the final words your heart already knows . 
.. i shouldve known better by now .. but you look so damn good ... run away from your mistakes .. just like the ones you hid from me .. why cant you see that i was expecting this all along .. 
i cant go on without your love . you lost . you never held on . 
cruel .. cruel world .. what more can you do ? just come on .. and break me down . if all is lost .. then im ready to let go .. just give me the word .. and ill be gone . forever is a scary word .. and i was ready for it once .. and now again .. but this time it has a different meaning . 
hearing your voice on the phone , it makes me feel like im further from home . i miss how it feels when we touch .. just like a papercut . the little things hurt so much . i cant go on cuz now youre not where i want you to be .. </3 
theres no use in lighting a fuse .. so i save my rage for another day . and i lie in bed facing towards the stars .. wishing i could fly away for good . 
.. just gonna stand there and watch me burn .. but thats alright because i like the hurts .. just gonna stand there and hear me cry .. but thats alright because i love the way you lie .. 
i am your hate , you are my love . i am your lust , you are my love drug .. the one that cures me . 
the pains of death can no longer haunt you as the dawning sky brings forth one forsaken thought death can not win for I now dwell in the palace of decay and I shall stay the hands of fate 
its hard to wake up when the shades have been pulled shut . this house is haunted .. it's so pathetic .. it makes no sense at all . im ripe with things to say .. the words rot and fall away . if a stupid poem could fix this home .. id read it every day . 
the life that i am force fed .. im scared of the road ahead .. have you listened to a word ive said ?.. the big picture is my dream is dead .. 
sigh . 
sickkk ): 
sad . 
today my inner child threw a tantrum because the voices in my head refused to share the sandbox of my mental playground . 
was gonna go to < PROPFIRST > but nooo ... so fuck ... maybe tomorrow or sumfin . 
i look alive , im dead inside . my heart has holes and black blood flows . we'll do some drugs we'll fall in love and get fucked up while the world just shrugs . with no thought logically , were wondering the streets so aimlessly . i hate to see these kids just being put down so painlessly . 
and it took so long just to feel alright . remember how to put back the light in my eyes . i wish i had missed the first time that we kissed . cause you broke all your promises . 
I might drive myself insane if those lips aren't speakin my name . Cause I got some intuition , or maybe Im superstitious . But I think you're a pretty sweet pill\ 
that Im swallowing down . 
just run away from these lies .. back to yesterday .. safe tonight </3 
im in lockport for a few days (: hit me up 1309-550-4971 i love youuu <3 
Are you gonna eat those tots 
I'd die tonight\ 
If only you were here\ 
I'd tell you I'm sorry\ 
I'd fucking disapear\ 
\ 
Betrayed , \ 
You look so pretty now\ 
Without me\ 
Alone\ 
The tears come crashing down . 
i need to find my place .. but it might not be here where i feel safe .. <3 
so follow me to the empty ocean we can watch the city descend behind the skylight . on our backs we float away and forget about the way it use to be . tonight , i fail . but i never wanted you to drown without me . tonight , we are the only ones to watch it fall apart . 
the colors of her mind bleed into each other .. and as the morning melts the night .. and the stars enchant another . while her eyes are still held shut she can hear a still , small voice . your words < PROPFEMALE > in her mind and your words are clear .. and she knows youre here . 
I tried to tell you but I failed once again , \ 
I truly can't have you simply being my friend , \ 
I dream of you nightly , and even during the day , \ 
I wish I could just tell you that I feel this way . </3 
Within me you can fall apart\ 
Leaving pieces of your lonely heart\ 
With Novacaine so I cant feel\ 
Within me you can see a hole\ 
A heart that lies in falling snow\ 
But not to numb to let you know\ 
Broken glass , shattered ice\ 
This is what Im holding in\ 
Even though the show is over\ 
You’re still in the audience\ 
Although you didn’t take this well\ 
In time youll be able to tell\ 
I just saved you from myself 
and here at the end.at the end of the hurt . all the pain aint the same when its your turn to burn ... i can not stand who i am . with this blood on my hands .. in this blood i am damned 
I know some things that you dont \ 
ive done things that you wont \ 
There’s nothing like a trail of blood \ 
to find your way back home 
Treading water with weights around my neck\ 
A shipwreck of reckless accidents\ 
Overboard and I'm about to quit\ 
Head first , high dive in this deep end\ 
Abandon ship , because it's sinking way too quick </3 
you brought me death .. and its all i ever wanted .. 
i see you .. you see right through me .. ) : 
I'd give it all just to have , have your eternity . Cause it's all that assures me . \ 
It's worth all that hurts me . I'd give you my heart , And I'd let you just hold it . \ 
I'd give you my soul , But I already sold it . On that day , That day I walked away in December . I will always remember . I'll regret it forever . I remember brown eyes , So sad and blue skies . Turned to darkness and night . I'm so sick of the fight . 
fml . 
i like you (: 
if i died ... whats one thing you would have wanted me to know ? 
my hearts on an auction . it goes out to the highest bid . (: 
baby , im a monster . 
This sensations overwhelming , Give me a long kiss goodnight and everything will be alright . Tell me that I won't feel a thing . So give me Novacaine 
i dont suffer from insanity ... i enjoy every minute of it . 
love me . 
im a sad panda . 
theres a girl in my mirror crying tonight , and theres nothing i can say to make her feel alright . </3 
theres a party in my pants , and youre invited ;D 
my heart longs for you , my soul dies for you , my eyes cry for you , my empty arms reach out for you . 
i hate you >:[ 
Back home , off the run\ 
Singing songs that make you slit your wrists\ 
It isn't that much fun , staring down a loaded gun\ 
So I won't stop dying , won't stop lying \ 
If you want I'll keep on crying\ 
Did you get what you deserve ? \ 
Is this what you always want me for ? 
stick that in your juice box and suck it . 
will you be my < PROPFIRST > ? 
im alone and i dont see a < PROPMALE > to fix this head so just give up . write me off , pretend i dont exist . theres something in an empty bed that makes it hard to close your eyes . it can eat at you until they both turn black and blue and all you want is a reason you should live or a way for you to die . 
turn my insides out and smother me . 
and the worst part is before it gets any better were heading for a < PROPMALE > and in the free fall i will realize im better off when i hit the bottom </3 
I'm still afraid of ghosts that can see me\ 
They know my thoughts , they read my mind\ 
Beside myself i judge my condition\ 
I close my eyes but can't go blind\ 
I'm feeling all the heat , all the chaos\ 
It's gotten underneath my skin\ 
So far to go to reach an absolution\ 
My sanity , my soul runs thin 
those painful times so alone , so ashamed\ 
im not coming back\ 
theres nothing to gain 
Empty . 
couldnt possibly ever stop missing you . 
Among these ruins of our life\ 
I walk slowly , sufferings tearing me\ 
Flashes hurt my mind\ 
I see you everywhere , i can't forget you\ 
The rain is falling out , the wind is whispering\ 
The world's turning dark , the ambient cold\ 
I feel your presence , your arms around me\ 
Your head on my back\ 
I killed myself to join you 
so lonely without you ... 
feels like she has no friends .. 
... its all the same 
Lost . 
im so fucking sick of people ... i absolutely hate being ignored ... ditched ... uninvited ... left out ... it fucking sucks ... and what sucks more is being kicked out of your own home for '' taking up too much space '' thanks .... 
me : -holds < PROPFIRST > in arms- im out of lube .. this may sting a little ... \ 
< PROPFIRST > : what ?! \ 
me : shhh ... just let it happen .. \ 
< PROPFIRST > : what the fuck are you talking about\ 
me : -lets go of < PROPFIRST > .. walks away- all in good time < PROPFIRST > .. all in good time .. 
Is in your closet waiting for you to fall asleep .. 
my heart hurts .. 
so come and take me away from this monster that youve made of me .. i feel like dying .. erasing all of these memories .. 
theres another world inside of me .. that you may never see . theres secrets in this life that i cant hide .. somewhere in this darkness theres a light that i cant find . maybe its too far away .. or maybe im just blind .. 
ughhh mom just made me eat a brussel sprout * puke * 
< PROPMALE > died ): 
Hiding behind the shadows\ 
I'll be waiting in the dark\ 
To drive this blade straight through your heart\ 
I'll drag your body to the car\ 
As blood races down my arm\ 
I think everyone will wonder where you are tonight . \ 
I'll hide you in my walls\ 
Your body will never be found\ 
I'll wear your skin as a suit , pretend to be you\ 
Your friends will like you more then they used to . 
they say time is a healer .. its more like a concealer for a scar .. cuz it never really leaves us . 
hold me close .. im falling faster .. tell me this could last forever .. </3
