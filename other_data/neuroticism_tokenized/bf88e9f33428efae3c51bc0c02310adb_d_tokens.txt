I am so tired of the disrespecting and bad talking behind my back . If there is something I am doing that you dont like or something I am doing wrong then at least say something to ME ! Talking about me and monitoring what I do wont fix any problems . So stressed . Stuck between a rock and a rock !!! :(

Being accused of beating Jaden again !!! Being threatened with DHS again .. So sick of this . < PROPFIRST > aka cunt can smack him in the face and hit him in his head but no one else is allowed to discipline . This is my house . my rules . PERIOD . He is not going to hit his sibling and get away with it and get away with it . I sent his ass to his room and on his way by me i pushed his head . DOES THAT QUALIFY AS CHILD ABUSE ??????? 
Well she is stopping < PROPFIRST > from seeing Jaden now what the hell does he do ?? 
Find LISA'S assumptions funny !!! I find the whole situation to be out of control . She is going to continue to fuck < PROPFIRST > over like she has been for years . Well that all comes to a stop now !

< PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > made it back early this morning .. YAY !!! Boy have I missed < PROPFIRST > . Its been a long few days . :/ Now to find us something to do today .. 
Slowly finding out who my real friends are . Slowly finding out who can be trusted and who cant . I thought I had all this figured out once but I realize now i dont always have the best judgment when it comes to people . Things will get better I just know it . Fuck what the rest think . 
Thinks it's sad that some ADULTS create DRAMA then try to stand clear when it back fires but , What's even more sad are the WEAK MINDS they MANIPULATE to BELIEVE it .. YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHO YOU ARE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Chilling with the kiddos today .. There watching cartoons and im listening to music .. Trying to rid myself of all the bullshit that surrounds me sometimes . Things will get better I have faith .. 
Love hurts whether its right or wrong .

Not a good start to the day today ... Got locked IN my house this morning .. Had to climb out my window and open the door from the outside .. Then the truck wanted to act up this morning .. Things seem to be getting a little better .. :/ Thinking I should have stayed in bed this morning .. On a better note .. < PROPFEMALE > the Nyquil worked :) I got sleep . 
There comes a point in your life when you realize who really matters , who never did , and who always will . I think I have reached that point :)

Last night a 2 yr old boy was hit and killed by a car on rt 125 in bowdoin , chasing a ball . It is said that the child is from Lewiston area and was just visiting relatives and that the relative chased and caught the child but lost grip . My thoughts are with the family of the child and the driver . If anyone knows anything please let me know . Saddest story I have heard in a long time . 
WTH has this world come to .. With mothers who would rather be sticking needles into there body then being with there children . Rather be high then be loved . Then parents who cant watch there own children in a yard and hit by an ongoing vehicle . Killed while under adult supervision . THEN mothers having children and then beating an infant .. a 20 day old baby was beatin by an ignorant ass chick from RICHMOND . wtf ???? 
If you dont like what I post dont read it . I know how I feel about it . I dont mind if others post how they feel but attacking someone because they posted how they feel is bullshit ... I didnt direct anything to anyone . stay off my < PROPFEMALE > if you dont like what i say .... period .. grow the fuck up 
This is the < PROPFEMALE > of the mother who beat her 20 DAY OLD infant . She broke the baby's arm , broke her ribs , choked her til blue , hit her and gave her a black eye . She was sentenced to 2.5 years in prison .. NOT LONG ENOUGH !!!! Feel free to go to her < PROPFEMALE > and leave as much \love\ " as you can . " 
Deacan and < PROPFEMALE > worked on there school books today with some help from me and Jaden .. wanna keep them learning LOL ... Then had a water fight outside with the kids Deacan < PROPFEMALE > and Jaden Adams while filling up the pool . All in all had a good day despite the heat . :) Now chillin inside with the a/c and all the fans going :) 
< PROPFIRST > got out early so we went out and played disc golf :) always a good time :) havent gone in a while . 
I turn all my NIGHTMARES into WET DREAMS :) 
Just changed hot water heater breaker by myself .. Who woulda thought I was capable of such things :)
