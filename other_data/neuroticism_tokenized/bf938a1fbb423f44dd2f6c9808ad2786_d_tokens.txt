Geez people ! Why does most people HATE Jewish people !?!? I mean , what did they ever do to US ! Why are we still in these wars that most people don't know why or how it even started in the first place !?!?!?! 
Dood ! My previous status got erased !!! Why did that happen ???? 
I always felt like I was not in good enough shape to work out . 
I'm so excited ! I get to go to the Philbrook Museum and they are featuring Brooklyn's Egyptian Exibit in it ! =D 
UGGG ! I am stuck in this humid house drinking water and eating crackers because my head and my stomach aren't agreeing with me today . x__x 
BP Oil Spill ? Well , not only did a Japanese oil tanker get wrecked on the ocean but some people TRY to bust other oil tankers ! If you kill the ocean man will die ! The Bible said that all who oppose God will be thrown into the Lake of Fire . If you strike a match to the ocean , you will create the Lake of Fire ! So let this show you all that God doesn't bring demise upon His children , but His children create their own .

All the people in a relationship and already had sex is starting to get to me . It's getting kind of frustrating ! I wished I had a boyfriend , but I keep telling myself that it's just peer pressure that is getting to me . What do you think ?

Every person has 1000 wishes , a cancer patient only has one : to get better . I know that 97% won't post this as their status - be one of the 3% and post this as your status . Do it for at least an hour , for those who have died of cancer or who are still fighting . 
Mixed emotions right now ... but i am a bit distressed . =S
