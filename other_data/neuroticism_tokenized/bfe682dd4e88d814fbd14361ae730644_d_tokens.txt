I know the majority of you know me and how pessimistic I am , so this post shouldn't really bother you , I just need to complain : I feel like I'm trapped in a never-ending maze of pain and misery , continuously going around and repeating the same mistakes . I just want solace , if not a moment of tranquility ... Is that too much much to ask for ? 
Quick fact you didn't know about me : if my birth mother had married my father , my last name would have been < PROPMALE > . \ 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ... Huh , doesn't sound good , does it ? I'm happy with my name . \
