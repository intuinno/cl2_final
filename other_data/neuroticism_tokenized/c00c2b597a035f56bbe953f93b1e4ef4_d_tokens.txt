That was motivation for me to continue and keep my Ish together ! On that note I CAN'T WAIT ! "

Tired of people bragging . Everyone is pretty/cute in their own way . And being pretty/cute could be taken away any second . And ugly people could be cute within seconds all they need is money . Material things come & go . But the only thing that matter is your inside cause your soul lives forever . 
< PROPFEMALE > here , I LOVE < PROPFEMALE > THIS much ! : -* 
dont drop that thun thun !

#106 well well well , hahahaha I love that even after you left u kept in touch . And I know you think I Ignore you but honestly I'm just a lagger . And I know you can't keep a secret anymore so I don't tell em to you no more . 
#3 I'm mad at you because you didn't come thursday ! Lol but we haven't we really talked or nothing like that ... When I heard you talk you made me feel better I thought I was the only one who had a UNIQUE voice . 
#007 your a cutie pie :) & I loveeeeeeeeeeeeee your song ( the slow one ) & I'm mad at you cause you dnt hmu no more :( 
#1213 Omg . You the coolest weirdest most turnt down Scoochie/sister I have lol . I love you thoo even though you always trying to dent a Nigga gas tank !

And like 3 more indirectly . But at the end you still my friend w/ the pretty eyes & nice smile :/ " 
I think we should all have fun sometimes , get along & play a game or two . ... FB provides that so \play up\ " ... Stop trying to be so \ " grown\ " / \ " different\ " cause it only makes you a boring person who is trying too hard to be unique =-o "
