I just went out at midnight , in the rain , wearing my trenchcoat , with a shovel , and buried a shirt in my backyard to dirty it up in preparation for a Halloween party on Saturday . It occurrs to me now how fucking creepy that must have looked from a third-person perspective . 

The next time you go to join a < PROPFEMALE > or a group on Facebook and the security check pops up on your screen , just cycle through some of the random words it pairs together ... a lot of those would be really awesome band names ! The Fired , Operating Still , and Grid 83 were just some of the awesome ones it gave me ! 
Just got my check in the mail from working the polls last week . It's payday , bitches ! 
Just saw ' Paranormal Activity ' last night with Miss < PROPFIRST > West . Fucking awesome , I highly recommend it ! 
Fuck's sake . I'm tired as hell and closing with the ' new guy ' today . This is going to be dog balls . >:[ 
This is one of the best things I've seen all week . http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc-EP-0xEDQ 
Oh christ , I'm rolling in home-made turkey noodles ... this is glorious ! 
Went to a metal show Monday night with Miss < PROPFIRST > West . Great bands , great company , shitty crowd . As the song goes , two out of three ain't bad ! 
Feeling pretty bleh . Runny nose , sniffles , sore throat . Probably coming down with something . D: 
Feeling much better today . No more fever , no more sore throat , sniffles are -mostly- gone . Back to my normal self ! ... and just in time for work . Oh goody . 
Under a winter storm warning until Sunday . Possible accumulation of up to five inches of snow . Put my sand bags in the back of the truck ... I fucking hate winter ... 
Cell < PROPMALE > is due , can't afford to pay it until next week . If anyone needs to get ahold of me , calling the house after 9:00 PM is your best bet . 
< PROPMALE > is paid , cell phone is functioning again , balance has returned to the force . 
The start of a new quarter year . That means it's time to back up my hard drives once again . Long night ahead of me ... 
Phone is dead again . THANKS FOR KILLING MY PHONE , < PROPFIRST > ! Hehehe , just giving you shit . ;P 
Ahhhh , jesus fuck shit it's snowing again ! >=/ 
It's alive ... its aliiiiiiiiiiiiiive ! ... my cell phone , that is . 
Already looking forward to going back down to Athens again . As soon as possible . 
Just figured up my city taxes , and looks like I owe Chillicothe 1¢ ... shit you not , one whole < PROPFEMALE > . I'm curious if I have to write a check for 1¢ , or if I could get away with being a smart-ass by putting a < PROPFEMALE > in the evelope with the filing ! 
I think my primary external hard drive is about nearing the end of its life ... which sucks , ' cause it's only a little over a year old . I have everything backed up onto a secondary hard drive should the primary fail , but that would still put a dent in the wallet should the need to replace the primary external arise . 
Had a dream last night in which at one point I was playing with a cat ... woke up and my eye was itching like mad . I'm even allergic to the cats in my fucking dreams ! 
Just called the Chillicothe City Income Tax Department , turns out they don't require payment of taxes owed below $1.00 ! Still would have been funny just to drop a < PROPFEMALE > in the envelope though , I must say . I might just do that anyway for shits and giggles ! 
I seriously just found $20 in change in a little baggie , tucked away in one of my many still unpacked boxes . ... fucking score . 
Tossing around the idea of applying to be a US Census Taker ... 
Just saw a ' < PROPFIRST > Kasich for Ohio Governor ' ad on Facebook . It claimed Kasich would bring ' A New Way , A New Day ' to Ohio . ... so I marked it as misleading . :) 
Also , it's Groundhog Day . ... is anybody else having a wicked sense of déjà vu ? 
Looks like I -may- be getting my vacation after all . Goddamn K-Mart and their vacation time allocation procedures . It's more complicated than the fucking tax code ! 
is being serenaded by < PROPFEMALE > with her horn . 
My co-worker was complaining about his back hurting tonight ... this might result in his calling off tomorrow and my being called in to cover for him . Fuck . 
I'm -really- hoping this snow nonsense stops in time for the roads to be clear come the weekend . 
Had a great time learning to ice skate with < PROPFEMALE > today ! Only fell and busted my ass twice ! 
Just as I turned to The Weather Channel to check out the forecast , the Jurassic Park theme began to play ... that can't be good . 
I passed the Census test , only missed two out of twenty-eight questions ( bare minimum passing is ten questions ) , so now it's up to the Census Bureau to determine whether or not they need me in my area . 
has died of dust induced tuberculosis while cleaning his room . 
I had a sore throat over the weekend and am now recovering , though on the verge of losing my voice . All these squeaks and squawks when I try to speak ... it's like puberty all over again ! 8D 
' s Face , 2010 ; Endorsed by < PROPFEMALE > Brewer . 
Ohio's other Senator , < PROPFIRST > Voinovich [ R ] comes in at 37th most conservative . < PROPFIRST > McCain [ R ] of Arizona ranked at 21st most conservative , hardly the batshit right-wing fundie so many make him out to be ! That title actually belongs to < PROPFIRST > Inhofe [ R ] of Oklahoma . Now -that- guy is pretty scary ! 
In other news , Facebook's 420 character status update limit can go die in a fire . 
Just bought mine and < PROPFEMALE > Brewer's tickets to Flogging < PROPFEMALE > , whose concert we will be attending with < PROPFIRST > ' Itchy ' Baker in < PROPMALE > on Thursday . 
is off to see Flogging < PROPFEMALE > tonight with < PROPFEMALE > Brewer and < PROPFIRST > ' Itchy ' Baker ! 
Gone through more than half a bottle of vodka . I feel pretty goddamn good right now ! I'm sure I'll retract this statement in the morning .... or not . < PROPFEMALE > liver , don't fail me now ! 
Love is everything . Friends , family , and lovers . <3 This is a lesson I'll never forget . 
Just went for a good long bike ride . I think the last time I rode my bike that much I was probably 12 ! 
To < PROPMALE > Hansel , < PROPFIRST > Daily , and < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > ... It's Hawaiian shirt weather , bitches ! 
Big vote in the House on health care reform today . Voting has just ended on a rule to debate the issue for two hours , so that is about to start . The Democrats need 216 yes votes to pass the Senate version of the health care reform < PROPMALE > . Any less than that and this particular reform < PROPMALE > will be defeated . < PROPFEMALE > Pelosi is confident ... that makes me nervous . We'll see how it goes ... 
Got a ' letter ' from State Sen. < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > , who made the mistake of including a questionaire to survey any issues I as one of his constuients might like to see addressed in the Statehouse . So I took the opportunity to complain about Ohio Revised Code 3513.04 , commonly known as the ' Sore Loser ' election law , and asked him to work on repealing it . =) 
It's taken me a long time to decide , almost right down to the wire before the May 4th Primary , but I believe I'm going to throw my support behind Secretary of State < PROPFEMALE > Brunner for the Democratic Nomination for US Senate . I highly support all of my Democratic Primary voting friends to do the same . 
Can't wait for < PROPFEMALE > Brewer to get here ! 
Happy Zombie Jesus Day , everyone ! 
Just got in the first mow of the season ... which also means allergy season officially started today . 
Yankees lost their first game of the season . Fucking epic ! 
And then the Reds go and blow it by losing big time to the Cardinals . Shite . 
First real thunderstorm of the season , as well . ... and all I can think is , ' That lightning flashed and that thunder clapped , that chain ' round ol ' uncle < PROPFIRST > went snap ! It rattled and fell to the floor with a thump and uncle < PROPFIRST > just sat right up!' 
I hope whoever stole my pro-union bumper magnet off the back of my truck dies slowly and painfully in a horrible flesh searing fire . 
is a poop deck . 
Just finished watching ' Milk ' with < PROPFEMALE > . Awesome movie , I highly recommend it ! 
I was formally invited ( via a flyer tucked under my windshield wiper , very classy ! ) to the ' Ohio's Fisrt Capital Tax Day Tea Party ' in Yoctangee park . ... right , like I'd spend my day with a bunch of tea baggers , even if I didn't have to work ! And an additional thought ... since when does Chillicothe have bicycle cops ? 
I believe a company that requires its employees to sign off on an agreement to not speak negatively of the company or its leadership has something to hide . 
I just completed the ( optional ) online training course to work the polls in the May 4th Ohio Primary Election . Now I just need to go to the class Thursday morning to complete my training and take the Oath of Office . 
Just completed the class and have been sworn in to work the May 4th Ohio Primary Election . Working at the Chillicothe 5-F precinct location at OU-C this time ! 
Due to an unexpected ' retirement ' , I've just been promoted to Master and Presiding Judge of the Chillicothe 5-F voting precict in the May 4th Ohio Primary Election . Things just got a lot more interesting . 
Loved < PROPFEMALE > Brewer's performance last night at One Voice ! 
Tomorrow's the primary , so if you're registered to vote and haven't done so already via absentee ballot , be sure to go to your polling location ! I'll be getting up at the crack of 3:30 AM to get the ball rolling for my precinct . Polls open at 6:30 AM and close at 7:30 PM , so make some time to vote , people ! 
I have returned from the polls ! ... 80 voters . That's . IT . Over the course of 15 hours . We were expecting a low turn out ... but really ? 80 VOTERS ?! Add the 19 that voted absentee , and we have a grand total of 99 voters from Chillicothe 5-F . That's a 23% voter turn out . ... that makes me sad . =( 
I'm just ready to watch the election results come in . < PROPFEMALE > Brunner won my precinct , 26 votes to 16 votes for < PROPFIRST > Fisher . Fisher is thus far leading Brunner state wide , but it's still early . We'll see . 
With 48% of precincts reporting in , < PROPFIRST > Fisher has been declared the winner of the Democratic Primary for nomination to the US Senate , 55% - 44% . 
Tight race for GOP nomination in the 18th District for Congress . < PROPFIRST > Dailey currently leads < PROPMALE > Gibbs and < PROPFEMALE > Moll 23% , 18.5% , and 17.73% respectively . < PROPMALE > Gibbs and < PROPFIRST > Dailey are the least batshit crazy Republicans running , but I don't know if I want one of them to win because of that , or if I want one of the crazier Republicans to win for an easier < PROPMALE > Space re-election campaign . Hmm ... 
Aaaaand -still- waiting on the GOP Ohio 18 race to be declared ... Bob Gibbs leads < PROPFIRST > Dailey by ... just 14 votes . 9711 to 9697 . 21.19% - 21.16% . \ 
\ 
... this is going to be a long night . And ... do I smell an automatic recount ? Possibly . 
Just waiting on < PROPFIRST > County at this point . 20 of its 26 precincts have reported in . All other precincts in all other counties in the 18th District have reported in . < PROPMALE > Gibbs leads < PROPFIRST > Daily by 170 votes , putting it at 21.10% - 20.77% . 
I got a call from the U.S. Census Bureau while at work today . Looks like I'll be working for the federal government for a short time as an enumerator ! I'll be taking the training course starting this Tuesday . 
I am now officially an enumerator for the U.S. Census Bureau . So yes , I am also one of those dirty Feds who is getting paid with your tax dollars ! But please , if you have any complaints , be sure to forward them to my boss ... Barack H . Obama , 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue , Washington D.C. , 20500 . 
Some random person , whom I've never met before , just knocked on my door and asked me if I'd help her move furniture with my truck . What , because I have a truck , suddenly I'm the neighborhood mover ? Piss off , you fucking bums ! 
Just had a fantastic meal with my dear < PROPFEMALE > Brewer at Applebee's , and now , for some < PROPFEMALE > Wars ! Happy birthday , < PROPFEMALE > . <3 
So tired . 
I probably just hit a new land speed record mowing my grass . With all the rain we've had and my schedule , I was unable to get to it for a few weeks . Since it started to look like the amazon jungle , and that I'd heard it was going to rain more over the weekend , I decided to go ahead and get it with what little daylight I had left after work . And by fuck , I got it done ! \ 
... \ 
* collapses in the corner * 
Dear Allergies , \ 
Fuck you . You guys are capital pricks . \ 
Sincerely , \ 
My Face . 
Just got paid by the government , direct from the US Treasury itself . Uncle < PROPFIRST > is my new best friend . ... well , until April 15th of next year , any way . 
left his facebook open . MWAHAHAHAAAAAA !!! * hacks/installs facebook virus * 
Why thank you , monsoon season , for hitting Chillicothe just as I'm out getting my last two census interviews completed ! 
I hear Lebron < PROPFIRST > could potentially be switching NBA teams . If he does , will I stop fucking hearing about him every five goddamn minutes ? 
Power is finally back on from being out for over 2 hours . But I got some reading done from ' The Handy Science Answer Book ' given to me by my dear < PROPFEMALE > Brewer ! 
Big election day today , 12 states total . Will be watching the results tonight after work . It'll be a good indication of the mood of the country and what the November election may hold . 
I find it infinitely amusing , when I take a step back from it all , that I am rivetted by the Senate Supreme Court nomination hearings , but when CNN switches over to talking about the world's longest tennis match , I get bored and turn the channel . 
Marathon of ' Bible Mysteries Explained ' on the Discovery Science Channel . Dropping some science on this bitch ! 
I have an interview tomorrow morning for a part time position with a local radio station . Here's hoping ! 
Hopefully the interview went well . It seemed to from my perspective , but we'll see . 
Effective July 5th , I have resigned from the US Census Bureau in favor of the upcoming radio gig . Apparently , I have a face for radio ! You may leave < PROPFEMALE > your consolations on her facebook < PROPFEMALE > . 
A Fourth of July < PROPFEMALE > Wars marathon on Spike all day tomorrow ? Goddamn better believe ! 
Just about to leave to spend my 4th of July with my beautiful girl < PROPFEMALE > Brewer , then off to < PROPMALE > on Monday to see Sick Puppies play at the Newport Music Hall ! With any luck , < PROPFIRST > ' Itchy ' Baker will be able to join us . Hope everyone has a safe and happy 4th of July . And don't forget to celebrate the American way ... go blow some shit up ! 
Just had a celebratory dinner with < PROPFEMALE > Brewer , and now about to disembark for 1406 to watch a movie or two ! 
I'm about to go Big Lebowski on the motherfuckers that keep taking my goddamn parking spot in front of my house . 
thinks < PROPFEMALE > Brewer is the coolest person ever . I wish every day I could be as awesommmmmme as her . Oh Emm Geee . 
I just got < PROPMALE > Rolled by Rush Limbaugh . God DAMN it . 
Prop 8 overturned ! 
Freedom to Marry and Fairness West < PROPFEMALE > report that Judge < PROPMALE > has lifted the stay on the Prop 8 decision . Still waiting on confirmation from any of the < PROPMALE > news networks before making it official .... 
And there it is . CNN , Truth Wins Out , Freedom to Marry , and Fairness West < PROPFEMALE > all report that the stay on Prop 8 has been lifted ! Starting August 18th at 5:00 PM , gay marriages can resume in California ! 
Holy shit ! I just met < PROPMALE > Strickland's brother on my way to work ! 
I had planned on mowing my grass today as this will be my last < PROPMALE > to do it for another week due to storms predicted tonight and tomorrow and work the rest of the week . It's starting to get pretty bad , but my digital thermometer reads 102 , so my grass can go fuck itself for a while longer . 
Cueto , what the fuck is your problem ?! Maybe you'd like a silver platter to go along with the four home runs you've given the Dodgers in the last two innings ?! You had best un-fuck yourself ! 
About to see Inception with < PROPFEMALE > . 
Big primary night tonight . Five states have their primaries . One of the top races ; < PROPFIRST > McCain is fighting to secure his nomination for re-election in November . I'm pulling for him , if only to hand the Tea Party nutjobs another defeat . Those of my liberal friends who dislike him , you think McCain is bad ? You haven't seen right-wing batshit crazy until you've seen McCain's primary opponent J . D . Hayworth ! 
Fuck my computer . 
Got my license renewed and my terrorist tags today . They expire in September 2011 . ... 9-11 . I'm probably a horrible person for finding that funny . I'm okay with this . 
Been having issues with my texts lately . < PROPFEMALE > sent me a text that I didn't receive until 5+ hours later , so if anyone sends me a text and I don't respond for several hours , that's why . 
On the Real Clear Politics website , there is a link that leads directly to an article published yesterday by the Chillicothe Gazette ... and it covers Unions not supporting Congressman < PROPMALE > Space's re-election . As if < PROPMALE > Gibbs will do you bastards any favors ? Anyone who knows my politics knows I typically support labor unions , but this time I'm with Space . The unions that would rather let Gibbs win can go fuck themselves . 
Just had an awesome lunch at Frisch's with my beautiful < PROPFEMALE > Brewer , opened my presents , and walked around down town Chillicothe , in the park , and even got to visit the old caboose/railroad museum just in front of the park . Awesome day . <3 <3 <3 
And thanks to everyone for the birthday wishes ! 
Just got the letter in the mail . I've been reappointed as the Master and Presiding Judge at the Chillicothe 5-F voting precinct for the November election . 
Headed to Cincinnati with dad to see the Reds ! Hopefully they'll play better than they have the last few games . 
Reds blew it in the top of the 9th . They had been leading 1-0 , but gave the Pirates three runs and couldn't make up the difference . But , still a great day to spend with my dad , and on Saturday I got to < PROPFEMALE > out with < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > Rudawitz , < PROPFIRST > ' Itchy ' Baker , and saw my most beautiful < PROPFEMALE > Brewer march in the 110 on game day , so all in all , an epic weekend ! 
< PROPMALE > Strickland is going to be in Yocktangee Park Saturday at 11:30 AM ... and I'm going to miss it because I have to be at the station at noon ... =( 
I think I've just about got my ballot figured out . Not counting candidates running unopposed , I'll be voting for two Republicans , two Libertarians , and nine Democrats . I pride myself on being an independent minded , moderate voter , but this is the most lopsided ballot I've ever had . But considering the gains the GOP is bound to make , especially with the Tea Party influence this year , I'd say it's justified . 
I just got a phone call from a Democratic operative inviting me to an event in Chillicothe this Sunday at 3:00 PM that both < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > and Congressman < PROPMALE > Space will be attending ... I'm going to be at the radio station from noon to 6:00 ! < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > Space ! Two of the greatest Ohio Democrats to ever live ! Why do they do this to me ?! 
I filled out my absentee ballot last night , my grandmother filled out hers today , and < PROPFEMALE > Brewer voted early at the Athens County Board of Elections ! If you haven't voted already and are registered to , I highly suggest you beat the November 2nd rush and go vote as soon as possible ! Not registered ? What are you waiting for ?! Today is the last day to register to vote in this year's general election ! Go go go ! 
OH-18 is a R+8 district with a Democratic incumbent representative in an anti-incumbent , Pro-GOP election cycle ... so why the hell am I not seeing any polling conducted here ?! According to Congressman < PROPMALE > Space's campaign , their own internal polling says he's ahead of < PROPMALE > Gibbs , but they don't say by how much . Come on , Rasmussen , Gallup , Zogby , SurveyUSA , Quinnipiac , ANYBODY ! I'm dying out here ! 
Just finished carving pumpkins with < PROPFEMALE > Brewer ! Pumpkin seeds are roasting in the oven , and pictures of us with our pumpkins when I get home tomorrow to upload them ! 
Whether you're lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender , queer or a straight ally , be proud of who you are and your support for LGBT equality this Coming Out Day . Donate your Facebook status to show your support and spread a message of equality to your friends and family . 
Given the opportunity I'd fix everything that's wrong with me\ 
' Til then I'll just fall asleep watching the shadows on the ceiling\ 
Paralyzed from the brain stem down , I'm living life in a < PROPFEMALE > cloud\ 
Dose up on my medicine , make me feel normal again\ 
Is a handful of pills supposed to make it all right ? \ 
It all looks the same through my bloodshot eyes ... 
Had a horrible dream last night . I was watching the election results come in on television , and out of nowhere , the GOP managed to win a 57 seat majority in the Senate on the Tea Party wave . I think it came from the realization I had that with the gains in Congress the Republicans are going to make this year , progress on gay rights and campaign finance reform will further be hindered , if not scrapped entirely . 
The Democratic Party as a whole might suffer a slaughtering this year , but with a reduced majority , or even a slim majority gained by Republicans , we Blue Dog Democrats will be coming back in a big bad way ! 
Two weeks to go to election day ! If you're registered , I highly suggested you take advantage of Ohio's early voting process , currently underway . You can vote by absentee , or in person at your county's designated early voting location . See my Facebook event for more details ! 
Thank you to < PROPFEMALE > Brewer , < PROPFIRST > ' Itchy ' Baker , < PROPFEMALE > , and Dad for being there for me today when I needed you most . Without your love and support , I don't what I would have done today . Thank you so very , very much . <3 
Seven days until Election Day ! Just a friendly reminder , everyone . I'll be attending my Master & Presiding Judge elections class on Thursday at 9:00 AM as a requirement of my responsibilities . What is your responsibility on Election Day ? Show up and vote ! It's not difficult , and your vote DOES count ! Get all the information you need from your local Board of Elections , then perform your civic duty : Go vote ! 
Here's to all my fellow moderates and just every day folks attending the Rally To Restore Sanity ! I'll be watching < PROPFEMALE > Brewer march today , then some Halloween shenanigans tonight . And , of course , just three days until Election Day ! Monday is the last day for early and absentee voting here in Ohio , and Tuesday is the big day everywhere ! Get up , get going , and go vote , go vote , go vote ! 
Had an epic Halloween in Athens with < PROPFEMALE > Brewer , < PROPFEMALE > Baker , < PROPFIRST > Brantch , < PROPFIRST > Cuff , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > Callam , and everyone else ! And now , with just two days to go to Election Day , it's crunch time ! I'll be busy over the next two days preparing to work the polls on Tuesday . Go vote ! 
Just one day to Election Day ! Go out and vote ! If you know anyone who hasn't already voted via absentee or early voting who is on the fence or say they're not voting , convince them otherwise ! This is the year we decide our representatives in Congress ! We elect Representatives , Senators , and Governors ! In so many ways , midterm elections are FAR more important than presidential elections ! Go vote , go vote , go vote ! 
Okay everyone . Heading to bed soon , need to be up at 3:30 AM to get ready for the election ! I'll likely make a quick post before I head out the door , then I'll be in total communication black-out until after the polls close tomorrow at 7:30 PM EST . And as always , go vote , go vote , GO VOTE ! 
Today is the day . In just a few hours the polls will open in Ohio . They will be open from 6:30 AM to 7:30 PM . That gives you 13 full hours to vote if you haven't already . I've mentioned numerous times just how important this and every election is . Make sure if you haven't already voted , that you vote today ! You have plenty of time , so make time to vote ! Go vote , go vote , GO VOTE ! 
With Coons beating O'Donnell in Delaware , Blumenthal beating McMahon in Connecticut , and Manchin beating Raese in West < PROPFEMALE > , it looks like the Dems have a better shot at holding the majority , albeit a slim one , in the Senate . Portman beats Fisher here in Ohio ... no big surprise there . Strickland leads Kasich currently ... but only 20% of the vote is counted thus far ... 
Republicans take the House . 
Congressman < PROPMALE > Space loses to < PROPMALE > Gibbs in OH-18 ... 
Not only did Republicans win all of the executive offices in Ohio , so too did they win back the Ohio State House . They will have at least a 58 - 41 majority . With these majorities , there will be a massive gerrymandering yet again in Ohio with the redistricting to come in 2012 . Ohio will be red for the next 50 years ... 
Senate\ 
Minority Leader < PROPMALE > McConnel : \Churchill once said 
Rossi concedes to < PROPMALE > in Washington , Democrats retain 52 seats in the Senate . Alaska is between two rival Republicans , so the count will be 52 - 48 . 
An amendment to my previous post : I neglected to note that < PROPFIRST > Bennet in Colorado won his race by the skin of his teeth as well , so with the eventual Republican victory in Alaska , be it Miller or Murkowski , the count will be 53 - 47 in favor of the Democrats . 
To < PROPFIRST > ' Itchy ' Baker and all those who have served this country , happy Veterans Day ! And to < PROPFEMALE > Brewer and The Ohio University Marching 110 , happy Jacket Day ! 
Off to < PROPMALE > to see < PROPFEMALE > Brewer and The Ohio University Marching 110 at the Marching 110 Ohio Theater Show ! 
No Labels is being featured on The Last Word With < PROPFIRST > O'Donnell! 
Turn in my two weeks ' notice at K-Mart : Mission Accomplished . 
Listening to the attorney representing the supporters of Prop 8 is making me rage . 
The extension of the Bush tax cuts and unemployment benefits passes the Senate by a vote of 81-19 . Should it pass the House as is expected and signed by President Obama , another $900 billion will be tacked on to our national deficit . Epic fail . 
Thank you , Senators < PROPFIRST > Voinovich and Sherrod Brown for helping to end DADT once and for all ! I've never been more proud of Ohio's representation in Washington ! 
As I will likely be preoccupied Christmas day , spending the first half with my beautiful < PROPFEMALE > Brewer , the driving back home to Chillicothe with another full slate of things to do , I'll wish everyone a < PROPFEMALE > Christmas today ! 
The House will come to order . 
With 218 votes , < PROPFIRST > Boehner has reached the necessary threshold and has been elected Speaker of the House . 
And with Speaker Boehner having just been sworn in and administering the oath of office to the other 434 members of the House of Representatives , the 112th Congress of the Unites States is now officially in session . 
The ground wasn't this fucking white when I started class two hours ago . 
There are reports that Rep. Gabby Gifford's shooter owned both a copy of The Communist Manifesto and Hitler's Mein Kampf . That suggests to me that his rampage was motivated neither by the likes of < PROPFEMALE > Palin and the Republican Party , nor < PROPFIRST > Olbermann and the Democratic Party , but rather his own insanity The Batshit Crazy Party . 
Additionally , I'm taking this opportunity to withdraw my support of the Americans Against the Tea Party Facebook group . The blood on the ground in Tucson wasn't even cold before they began using the tragedy for political sharp shooting . Their actions have proven to me they are no better than the Tea Party demagogues they claim to oppose . I strongly urge anyone else affiliated with this group to do the same . 
Well , Governor Kasich's inauguration is starting off with all the pomp and circumstance of an elementary school musical . 
As the universe expands outward from the point of the big bang , planets , stars , and galaxies will continue to change positions . I once was a ' Virgo ' , but now I am a ' < PROPFIRST>' . But in the grand scheme of things , the universe doesn't give two flying shits , so neither shall I . 
Debate on repeal of the Affordable Health Care Act has commenced in the House . All this talk about repeal ... how about reforming the law , instead ? There's too much good in the law to throw it all out . In a perfect world I'd like to see a public option and tort reform as well , but at least drop the individual mandate and make health care plans competitive across state lines , that would be enough for me . 
Voting has begun on the repeal of the health care law . Only 218 votes are needed to pass repeal in the House of Representatives . 
218 votes have been reached . Repeal passes the House of Representatives . 
The < PROPMALE > to repeal the Affordable Health Care for < PROPFEMALE > Act has passed the House of Representatives with a final vote of 245 to 189 . Three Democrats joined all Republicans in passing the < PROPMALE > , with one Democrat not voting . That's as far as it will go for now however , as Senate Majority Leader < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > has stated the Senate will not take up a vote on the repeal < PROPMALE > in the foreseeable future . 
For fuck's sake . Intro to Audio is canceled again . There was going to be a quiz today , too ! 
It's been a wonderful year with < PROPFEMALE > Brewer , the best year of my life . You've shared some wonderful times with me and helped me through one of my most difficult . I look forward to having you by my side to face all the things life has in store for us . I love you with all my heart . Happy one year anniversary , Julis . <3 
Made the final payment on the truck today , now just need to wait for the bank to send the title in the mail . Damn , it feels good to be debt free ! 
Your mother is so fat , the escape velocity at her surface exceeds 3x10^8 m/s . 
The < PROPMALE > Correctional Institute is being featured on NatGeo at 10:00 PM tonight . 
Ha ! Last year I owed the City of Chillicothe 1¢ ( though I wasn't required to pay , being under $1.00 ) . This year , the city technically owes me a refund of $1.90 ! But , given the dire fiscal situation of the city budget , I think I'll pass on demanding my refund . There Chillicothe , don't say I never did anything for you !
