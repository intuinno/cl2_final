Its maybe a little possible that I kinda sorta almost definitely miss you . 
According to you I'm boring , I'm moody , You can't take me any place . But according to him I'm beautiful , Incredible , He can't get me out of his head . According to him I'm funny , Irresistible , Everything he ever wanted . I need to feel appreciated , Like I'm not hated . Oh no . Why can't you see me through his eyes ? It's too bad you're making me decide . 
Find a guy who calls you beautiful instead of hot , who calls you back when you < PROPFEMALE > up on him , who kisses your forehead , who shows you off to the world when you are in sweats , who holds your hand in front of his friends , who thinks you're just as pretty without makeup on . One who is constantly reminding you of how much he cares and how lucky his is to have you . The one who turns to his friends and says , ' that's her . ' 
I have a few really amazing friends <3 
Life is so perfect right now <3 School , friends , family ... everything is wonderful =)

I'm a dinosoar . So ... like RAWR n ' stuff =) 
Today I was happier than a bird with a french fry <3 I has the best boyfriend in the whole universe and all the parallel ones too ! =) 
I dont understand how I can go to bed perfectly healthy and happy but wake up 5 hours later with a full blown migrane ='(( Even worse , the definition of chronic headaches fits me perfectly . 
Today doesn't look like it's going to be a great day =/ Up all night with a migrane , throwing up , allergies , and of course my phone has decided it doesn't want to make or receive calls ... awesome . Good thing I have the best boyfriend in the universe or I would be crying .

Friday nights in Tallahassee are the worst . Everyone decides to get drunk and scream as loud as possible . Its too noisy to sleep and when I dont sleep I start thinking about everything that makes me cry ='( I wish I could turn my thinker off ... 
So , today was fun =) Aside from the fact that I burst a blood vessel in my finger and now it's all blue and purple ... Eww . 
Just so y'all know , < PROPFEMALE > is the chocolate to my strawberry ! <3 < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , Mummy , Maimee ! =) 
I'd rather be hated for who I am than loved for who I am not . 
My body spent the last 5 months telling me I'm too stressed . I think it's finally given up on me . Headache everyday for approx . 2 months , throat has swollen up overnight to the size of a golfball , allergies are taking over , nosebleeds for 13 days in a row , and it's highly possible my finger is broken . I think I need to slow down and , as my loving friends would say , \chill the f *** out ... \ " O.O " 
Skype is the best thing ever ! I get to see/talk to my mummy whenever I want and I can sit and < PROPFEMALE > out with < PROPFIRST > from 3 hours away ! Yay ! <3 Gotta love a boyfriend who tells you to get skype because he misses you =P 
Yay ! All the paperwork is done ! Got the keys to the house today ! Next few weeks will be moving in ! <3 Maddy and < PROPFEMALE > ! 
I went all day with no headache then BAM ! It hit me like a raging bull and in the past 20 minutes it's gone from annoying to start of a migrane ... unfair ='( 
Is attempting to rehydrate since I didn't do a good job of that today ... GULP ! ^.^ 
Awesome ! My phone is on the < PROPMALE > again ... can't make or recieve calls . I may or may not be missing texts but I have no idea because my high-tech $240 phone freezes if I sent more than one text within 2 minutes of each other . Thanks AT&T . You rock . 
I dream of a better tomorrow ... where chickens can cross the road and not have their motives questioned . 
OH . MY . GOODNESS . GRACIOUS . Kick Ass is my favourite movie of all time . No joke . It was incredible ! =D Fighting off another horrible cold . Hopefully this time I can get rid of it completely so it doesn't keep coming back . Lucky for me I have the sweetest most wonderful boyfriend in the whole world ! I love you so much < PROPFIRST > ! <3 
Being this sick is the worst thing in the world . All I want is a gallon of orange juice , lots of pasta , and to stay in bed all day and get better . Unfortunately for me , I have to take care of myself . Sometimes being away from home sucks =( 
Oh my goodness ! I just woke up to < PROPFIRST > walking in with bags of healthy groceries and a Chick-fil-A breakfast so that I'm set for the day because he wont be here and I'm so sick I can barely stand up . He is the most wonderful incredible boyfriend in the whole universe ! I love him so so so much ! <3 Today will consist of food and sleep =) 
It's ridiculous how quiet it is during the day but the second the sun goes down and normal people can shut up , my whole apartment turns into the loudest place on campus -.- I love my awesomelly rude roommates . Cant wait to move ! <3 
Oh boy ! So in love ! <3 I just can't help it ^.^ After almost 20 years , this is the first time I can say the words \in love\ " ='D " 
I meant my computer is going into surgery . Gonna be hard to reach me tomorrow :( I love < PROPFIRST > so much ! xoxo 
It's just sad when the ITS guys take one look at my computer and say \Oh shit ! \ " :( Hopefully will be fixed soon ! Missing < PROPFIRST > like crazy ! I can't believe tomorrow is our 3 months ! It's gone by so fast ! I love him so much ! <3 " 
So I just tuned into Fox to prepare for Glee and saw the last performance . Wow . Nobody but < PROPFEMALE > deserves to be on that stage . Guess I'm not missing anything this season . Yay Glee ! Yay beautiful present from < PROPFIRST > ! Yay computer being fixed ! Boo having a cold ! Boo nosebleeds ! Missing my baby like crazy ! 3 months tomorrow ! <3 
I can't sleep :( Oh I knew this day would come lol I sleep better when Brandons with me ^.^ I miss him ! 3 months <3 
JUST WANTS TO SLEEP ! D'= I'm exhausted ... 
I love you < PROPFIRST > ! <3 Happy 3 Months ! Honestly the best 3 months of my life so far and I know it'll just keep getting better ! ='D 
So my doctor says I'm experiencing rebound headaches . I get headaches from taking medication . Odd ? I think so . So I have to experience a few days of withdrawl and not take anything ! Lol . Oh well :p HAPPY 3 MONTHS < PROPFIRST > ! I LOVE YOU SO MUCH ! 
Muffins <3 I love < PROPFIRST > ! 3 Months ! ^.^ 
Awful headache and I can't take anything for it :/ I really hope sleep helps ! <3 < PROPFIRST > ! 
Oh my gosh , my head is killing me ! Gonna eat healthy and stay hydrated so hopefully I can get over this pain quickly ! Can't wait to see my < PROPFIRST > tonight ! I miss him so much ! So excited that Mummy and Maimee get here tomorrow night ! XD 
I would very much like my computer back . So excited that < PROPFIRST > comes home tonight ! I don't feel like me when he's not around . I love him so much ! Mummy and Maimee get here tomorrow ! This weekend is going to be absolutely wonderful ! xoxo 
I have my computer ! It's so pretty ! I missed it ! <3 < PROPFIRST > ! 
Oh , I wish I was a glow worm . A glow worm's never glum . ' Cause how can you be grumpy when the sun shines out your bum ? 
I hate < PROPFIRST > Beiber with a passion . Hate . Hate . Hate . 
If you are not secure enough to be single , then you are not mature enough to be in a relationship . It's not love if you're only in a relationship just so you're not alone . Love is knowing you can live without that person but never wanting to . If you can't be alone , you're just desperate . I love < PROPFIRST > <3 
This is what < PROPFIRST > got me ! It has a < PROPFEMALE > and a < PROPFEMALE > and I love it and I love him ! <3 http://www.zales.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2136824 
I feel absolutely awful ='((( No matter how exhausted I am , I can't sleep . I don't drink caffeine anymore , I don't nap as often , I don't take headache medicine , I'm taking care of myself ... I just don't understand ! I'm exhausted and I go to bed early but never get to sleep until the next morning ! Unfair ='((( 
I love having < PROPFIRST > here ^.^ He takes such great care of me ! Mummy and Maimee get here tonight ! I can't wait ! * shudders with excitement * Eeeeep ! xoxo 
For the past 18 hours , I have been experiencing the worst migrane I have ever had in my entire life . 
Oh my gosh ! I have about 5 things left to move then I'm completely moved in with my favourite girls and best roomies in the world ! <3 Maddy and < PROPFEMALE > :) Loved having Mummy , Maimee , and < PROPFIRST > around for moving day ! I'm so happy ! 
Is finally completely moved into my wonderful house with Maddy and < PROPFEMALE > ! Love my mummy so much for coming to help move ! 
So in love with < PROPFIRST > ! Love living with my girls ! So happy for Maddy ! Love seeing her so giddy ! Ran into < PROPFEMALE > today which was completely wonderful ! Missing her so much ! My life is wonderful ! <3 
I despise people who use others for selfish reasons . Thats not friendship . On a happier note : I love that I haven't had one headache since I moved out of the apartment ! I'm no longer surrounded by inconsiderate awful people ! I'm loving every second of my life right now ! I'm always so happy and goofy ! Finally me again ! <3 Maddy , < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFIRST > ! 
Wow ... I just epically face palmed when I read a certain someone's status -.- 
I wonder how much deeper the ocean would be without sponges ... 
* face palm * 
I love < PROPFIRST > Gilmore with all my heart :) I have the absolute most incredible friends in the world <3 < PROPFEMALE > Cates , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > Nix , < PROPFEMALE > Goolsby , < PROPFEMALE > Clephane Tonnison <3 My life is wonderful !

My life would be a million times better if I hadn't met certain people . Some people quite literally don't deserve to have any friends . 
I can't sleep knowing he's upset and in pain ='(( I love him so much ! <3 < PROPFIRST > 
I feel way older than 19 . I'm so ready to have my career and my family and move somewhere far away from these lying immature babies and start a new better life ! 
Lonely :( Gonna shower and start packing . Cant wait to see < PROPFIRST > later .

He's my best friend <3 I'm just in love with him too :) 
HAPPY BIIRTHDAY < PROPFEMALE > ! =D 
I feel like I need a change . I feel good about myself , but I want to feel great !

Walmart babies piss me off . Target babies are CUTE !!! 
Hates cashiering with a passion . Within my first hour of doing it , some really old lady got pissed when I asked for her ID and said I shouldn't be a cashier if I can't tell she's old enough to buy alcohol ... UGH ! It's the law you dumbass ! 
Feels so sick :'( nap made it worse 
Sex and the City with < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFIRST > ! <3 
Ran into four awful people at the Rave :( I actually get tight chest pains from how scared I get when that happens ... so happy I have < PROPFIRST > now ! 
You can bend but never break me ' Cause it only serves to make me More determined to achieve my final goal And I come back even stronger Not a novice any longer ' Cause you've deepened the conviction in my soul Oh yes I am wise But it's wisdom born of pain Yes , I've paid the price But look how much I gained If I have to I can face anything\ 
I am strong I am invincible I am woman <3 
Has pretty much hidden the majority of people I haven't deleted yet . It's not cool to swear all the time and constantly mention your alcoholic tendencies . Actually , it makes you look like an idiot . Grow up . Nobody thinks your cool . Anyway , woke up with another awful headache :'( Work 12-8 . 
Work wasn't actually too bad :) 8 hours of cashiering was a little rough but everyone who works at Target is so great ! My ankle is so swollen ! Missing < PROPFIRST > like crazy ! Hoping < PROPFEMALE > gets better soon ! Love my roomies so much ! <3 I am happy :) 
Ugghhh ! I want to sleep but I CAN'T BECAUSE OF ALL THE NOISE ! -.- 
='( My throat and ankle are both swollen . I wanna sleep ... 
Ahhhh ! I just had a dream about cashiering ! NOT COOL ! 
Is actually physically ill and can't sleep because of the insane need to have the air set at 67 -.- Wtf ?! That's too cold . I'm not in a good mood . Very bad mood in fact . 
No Target ! I will NOT work an extra shift today after an 8 hour shift yesterday , a swollen ankle and awful chest pains ! -.- 
This face mask is rather refreshing :) While I have the energy , I am pampering myself ! 
Feels pampered :) Just gotta get my hair done ! It's so blonde ! I love my girls so so much ! <3 < PROPFEMALE > Cates , < PROPFEMALE > Goolsby , and < PROPFEMALE > Nix <3 You guys are the greatest ! Loving < PROPFIRST > Gilmore so much ! 
So sleepy ! Goodnight everyone ! Work from 12pm - 6:30 pm AND I get to work with the lovely < PROPFEMALE > Nix tomorrow ! <3 
Hasn't been able to sleep for more than 4 hours a night for the past week even though I go to bed almost crying from exhaustion . Whatever little insignificant piece of health I have left is being destroyed by my lack of sleep -.- Work from 12 - 6:30 . At least I get to see < PROPFEMALE > today , FINALLY ! 
Wow . I have a whole new HATE for certain people and a lot more LOVE for some others :) < PROPFEMALE > is an absolutely wonderful friend ! I love her !

Work from 4-10 :) Another day with < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Again , I'm even happier today than I was yesterday ! He is just so amazing ! Everyday he makes me feel like a < PROPFEMALE > ! <3 I love him so much !

Sonic with < PROPFEMALE > ! Love her ! <3 
It seems no matter how old I get or how kind I am , I will never understand true friendship :'( I need to start being more careful again :/ 
Now your photo's don't have a picture frame And I never say your name and I never will And all your things Well I threw them in the trash And I'm not even sad Now you only have yourself to blame For playing all those stupid games You're always gonna be the same and no You'll never change ! <3 Thank you , < PROPFIRST > , for not being an awful friend/boyfriend :) 
Spending the day with < PROPFIRST > ! <3 
I'm officially sick of everything . There's too much drama and bullshit and crappy people . I'm so over it . I'm just going to spend all my time with people who care about me and don't hurt me .

Relaxing with < PROPFIRST > :) Watching Tron and playing Sims 2 ! 
Backache/Cold/Allergy/Prescription Meds , New work uniform , and birthdays has made this a particularly difficult month :/ 
At this moment , I despise my bank . I plan on being extremely difficult and rude until they fix it . I'm VERY angry -.- 
WHY DOES PENAIR THINK IM SO STUPID ?! I HAVE THE PROOF YOU DUMBASSES ! ERGGGG ! 
I can insult people on levels that they can't even comprehend ... LIKE STUPID GIRLS WHO WORK AT PENAIR ! 
He is completely wonderful ! =') I love you < PROPFIRST > ! <3 
Is probably not going to < PROPMALE > for my birthday anymore :( 
The longer I'm away from Pensacola , the less I miss it . I miss my wonderful friends and roomies of course , but it would be nice to have a fresh start somewhere where my life isn't contaminated by people who talk about me behind my back and are wierdly obsessed with me ... I think moving so much in my life has given me the itch to move again =P Haha ! Hmmm ... where to go next ?! =) 
No matter what I will find a way to go to Islands of Adventure on my birthday and see the Blue Man Group ... MWAHAHA ! :) 
My car hit 40,000 < PROPMALE > today ! Work tomorrow from 11- 7:30 ! If I like you , come visit :) 
I pray your brakes go out runnin ' down a hill I pray a flower pot falls from a window sill And knocks you in the head like I'd like to I pray your birthday comes and nobody calls I pray you're flyin ' high when your engine stalls I pray all your dreams never come true Just know wherever you are , < PROPFEMALE > , I pray for you ;) Best song ever . Thanks < PROPFEMALE > :) 
Work 11- 7:30 :) Oh boy ! I do love him a lot ! <3 
Got sent home early from work :( Throbbing headache :'( Resting in my cold dark room . I wish < PROPFIRST > was here . 
Ugh ! So not happy ! It's not fair when people do stuff to you that you KNOW they would hate if you did to them ... and I never would :( Feeling much better after rehydrating , napping , and taking a cold shower :) Gonna take all my healthy vitamins and medicines and tomorrow should be a much better day at work ! <3 < PROPFIRST > Gilmore , < PROPFEMALE > Goolsby , and < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > :) 
It's only been 4 1/2 months and this is already the longest relationship I've been in where I haven't been lied to or hurt =')) He is the most wonderful guy in the world ! I love you < PROPFIRST > Gilmore <3 Work 10:30 -4 :) 
Only 2 more hours to go ! I love my job :) 
Found out some stuff about my past that truly makes me wonder how it's even possible for someone that close to me to be so two-faced ... and how someone I thought hated me actually turned out to be one of the greatest people in my life ... it really makes me wonder who my real friends are ... I love you < PROPFEMALE > Nix ! <3 
I honestly think this is the most epic fail at an attempt to be controlling in the whole universe . For one year , one person tried to keep me away from 4 people ... they are now my 4 best friends . IN YOUR FACE ! I love you guys so much ! You mean the world to me ! < PROPFIRST > Gilmore , < PROPFEMALE > Nix , < PROPFEMALE > Goolsby , and < PROPFEMALE > Cates <3 
Waiting for < PROPFIRST > to get back from class so we can go to lunch :) then taking an extra credit relationship survey for his class , then maybe a movie if he's up for it ! =P I love him so much ! 
Going to see The Karate Kid with my baby <3 I love him so much ! :) < PROPFIRST > won $4 today at the survey for his awesome drawing of us which is in the top 10 !

I love you < PROPFIRST > Carden Carpenter :) 
I miss the years that were erased I miss the way the sunshine would light up your face I miss all the little things I never thought that they'd mean everything to me Yeah I miss you and I wish you were here <3 
I get off the phone with him and instantly miss him again ='( I can't wait for Friday ! He finally comes home for the rest of the summer ! So in love with him ! <3 
Why would anyone keep turning the air conditioning off in the middle of summer in FLORIDA ?! Ugh ! ='( So sick of this . I never get any sleep anymore . Can't wait for < PROPFIRST > to come home ! 
A nice hot shower after a long day at work was just what I needed :) 
I want him to come home ='( 
I rarely ever have anything but happy statuses ... but tonight has sucked ='(( I'm so ready to curl up in a ball and sleep . 
Work today 10- 5:30 ! Missing my girl < PROPFEMALE > already and so jealous that she's going to Islands of Adventure ! < PROPFIRST > finally comes home for the summer tomorrow ! After he aces his exams of course ! Today and tomorrow are going to be busy but great days ! :)

Not fair . I come home from 12 hours at work and can barely move or keep my eyes open but wake up 2 hours later and can't get back to sleep ='(( So much for sleeping in ... 
12 hours of work , 2 hours of sleep , 4 hours of trying to sleep , and 2 more hours of sleep isn't what I had planned -.- I hope < PROPFIRST > is doing welll on his exams ! Cannot wait for him to come home ! :) 
< PROPFIRST > is home :) Can't wait to see my lovely gorgeous Mummy on Wednesday ! My eyebrows no longer look like they were taken over by ferrets ! Work tonight from 4:30 - 11:00 . 
i need him :'( 
Extremely bummed that I won't be with my Daddy on Father's Day or his birthday ='( Way more upset than I thought I would be . 
So far , today has been the most boring day at work ever ! 
Getting ready to spend the rest of Father's Day with < PROPFIRST>'s family <3 
Had an awesome day :) I love my roomies ! < PROPFIRST > is completely wonderful ! <3 
HAPPY 42ND BIRTHDAY TO MY DADDY ! I know he would be thrilled that I am telling everyone his age ! HAPPY 5 MONTHS TO THE LOVE OF MY LIFE ! :) Fastest 5 months ever ! Work tonight 5:30 - 10:30 and a horrible headache -.- NO WORK FOR THE NEXT WEEK ! =D 
I am so in love with him <3 Happy 5 Months < PROPFIRST > Gilmore ! I love you ! 
I'm having dreams about my job at Target -.- or should I say nightmares ? 
Hungry and sleepy . 
Driving back to Tampa tomorrow with < PROPFIRST > to see my loverly Mummy ! <3 
10pm and I still have so much to do :( Can't wait to see Mummy ! 
On the road to Tampa with < PROPFIRST > ! :) 
Tampa <3 Not looking forward to tomorrow but glad to be home :) 
Today is the day . Hoping things go well . Extremely nervous :( I love you so much Mummy ! RIP < PROPMALE > Garnham Smith 6.24.2010 <3 
Doesn't like seeing my Mummy like this :'( 
Gonna be back at the hospital early in the morning . Missing Mummy already and still worried . Thanks everyone for caring so much :) and thank you < PROPFIRST > for being here with me :') 
Mummy is lots better today ! =) 
Mummy gets to come home tonight ! :) 
Taking care of Mummy , Maimee , and < PROPFIRST > is exhausting * YAWN * but I don't mind :) I love them ! <3 Sometimes I still don't understand what I was thinking for that year and a half ... After 5 and a half months of being with < PROPFIRST > , I think I've finally realized that I didn't do anything wrong :) It's amazing not being lied to 24/7 <3 
\That Bugs < PROPFEMALE>'s a wascally wabbit\ " ~ < PROPFIRST > ='D " 
Mummy is recovering from surgery , Maimee is limping from surgery , and < PROPFIRST > can barely move a muscle because of his back ! Everyone is hobbling around the house ! I love taking care of everyone I love but I think it's time for bed now :p I have huge dark circles around my eyes from exhaustion . I love them all tons :) 
I can't remember the last time I felt so drained and exhausted ... 
Well , Mummy is home and doing well :) but now < PROPFIRST > is in Urgent Care :( Oh what a week ! 
This week has been crazy ! Mummy is recovering very well and looks beautiful as always ! Maimee is still kinda limpy ! < PROPFIRST > is taking Vicodin and Levaquin and may have to have surgery ! Aren't I the one that's usually unhealthy ? :p 
Well , I will not be driving back to Pensacola tomorrow . Staying in Tampa for a while until < PROPFIRST > no longer has a terrifying fever . He may have to have surgery though . Mummy is doing much better :) I have a feeling I'm going to get lectured by Target but that's thier problem . Family comes first <3 
Trying to get a puppy to pee during a thunder storm is like trying to get me to pee in a public toilet ... Not gonna happen . 
Mummy and < PROPFIRST > are both back in bed and asleep , Maimee is comfy and snoring , Kitchen is clean , and I took a lovely shower :) Time to relax until I am needed again ! 
I love my friends and family :) You know who you are ! 
Is still getting used to this not being lied to or treated like crap thing :) I like it ! 
I absolutely despise this Twilight obsession . I was reading the books in high school before anybody knew it existed ... it becomes a movie and everyone just LOVES it . Read a book people . The movies are crap . 
It amazes me how many people get upset when things don't go exactly their way and they think the world revolves around them . It's not all about you and it never will be . It's also shocking when your \friends\ " lie to you frequently . I'm so sick of Pensacola . " 
Can't possibly thank < PROPFEMALE > Nix enough for being such a wonderfully amazing person/friend ! <3 I love you girl ! You are incredible ! 
It makes me sick to know that someone from such an incredible and amazing family could be so two-faced and treat me like that for so long ... and that whole time I could've been with someone who actually loves me and makes me so happy <3 I love you < PROPFIRST > Gilmore ! 
Just gonna stand there And watch me burn But that's alright Because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there And hear me cry But that's alright Because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie 
Dr Pibb and Mr Pepper ! Oh wait ... 
The more time I spend with him , the more time I want to spend with him . I'm happy 110% of the time when we're together . I can't wait to figure out what's gonna happen next summer ! <3 I love you < PROPFIRST > Gilmore ! 
So exhausted from these past 2 weeks . All the worrying and waiting made me so tired . I'm so glad Mummy is doing so much better but I miss her so much ! I hope things go well at the doctor's for < PROPFIRST > tomorrow and maybe he won't need surgery ! Gonna try to get a good night's sleep before work tomorrow ! It's so nice to be back to my < PROPFEMALE > <3 I already miss < PROPFIRST > though ! 
It's so cold :'( 
Now im just tempted to sleep in my car where its warm and quiet . 
Hardly got any sleep :( Work until 5:30 then gonna < PROPFEMALE > out at < PROPFIRST>'s house . 
Work is insanely slow today ... 
Well , I said work was slow and then literally 10 minutes later it was really busy . Just my luck ! At least it made time go by faster :) Gonna eat a Hot Pocket then head over to see my < PROPFIRST > ! <3 
Fed up today ... probably an early night :( 
< PROPFIRST > killed a cockroach for me ! My hero ! I started crying but he saved me ! I love him ! ='))) 
Was up at 7:30 to begin my busy day :) Chik-Fil-A breakfast , Take < PROPFIRST > to the doctor's , Get my paycheck , Buy things , Pick up < PROPFIRST > from day camp , See The Last Airbender :) 
The Last Airbender with < PROPFIRST > :) Hopefully it's not as bad as everyone says ! 
Wow ... The Last Airbender is quite literally the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life . Rotten Tomatos gave it an 8% ... generous . 
Was very sick last night :( < PROPFIRST > took care of me and now I'm all ready for a busy day at work ! Gosh who doesn't love July 4th weekend :p Busy like a bumble < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Drama , Drama , Drama . 
Can't ... eating cookie . 
Is down about everything today :( Work until 4:30 then fireworks with < PROPFIRST>'s family tonight ! At least that will cheer me up :) 
Despite the awful headache and the throwing up , spending July 4th with < PROPFIRST>'s family was wonderful :) and I finally got to meet < PROPFEMALE > ! Tonight's gonna be a long night though . 
My tummy still hurts really badly :( Work 10 - 5:30 then spending the evening cleaning my room and putting stuff in space bags :) 
24 hours later and I'm still nauseus and have a headache :( Only one more hour of work then I get to completely clean my room ! My next paycheck will be hefty like a glad trash bag :p 
I'm done . No more . 
I really do have some amazing people in my life who make everyday better ! My lovely Mummy , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > <3 
Job hunting :) 
Work 10:30 - 5:30 then finishing up my room and doing some job hunting :) So excited to have a day off tomorrow ! I love my < PROPFIRST > lots n ' lots ! 
Hoping my BFFL Maddy gets better :'( 
So happy my Maddy is feeling better ! Today was a long long day ! I love < PROPFIRST > so much it's hard to believe it's even possible to have all that love ! :p 
Today is my day off and I still have to go to Target ! Lol . Gonna get some yummy fatty Chik-fil-a for lunch then clean the kitchen , living room , and my room :) Btw , I love < PROPFIRST > more and more everyday !

This week has really been one of those weeks ! I keep trying to be all optimistic but even the weather isn't cooperating ! :( I hope things get better soon . 
Watched The Crazies with < PROPFIRST > and now I'm not really wanting to sleep ! Lol . Work tomorrow from 10am - 5:30 pm . Hopefully I sleep well tonight ! :) Oh yea ! I love my < PROPFIRST > <3 
I dont like that I hate going to work because I know exactly what will happen ! All that goes on is gossiping and saying awful things about everyone ! Why is everyone so two-faced ?! 
Wow . Never in my life ( including middle and high school ) have I ever met such resentful immature gossiping people ... I guess they all went to work at Target . I really do not deserve this . I hope I get to work at Publix soon ! This place makes me cry :( 
Spent almost 2 hours on the phone with my lovely Mummy after a not so great day at work :) I feel better ! Gonna spend a little time with < PROPFIRST > then relax before an early night ! 
MINIONS ! =) 
Date with < PROPFIRST > ! < PROPFEMALE > Garden and Dispicable Me ! Hopefully it's not sold out ! The line is so long ! 
Despicable Me was hilarious ! I love Minions ! =) 
Going to get my hair cut so I don't look like a rat !

Home and wondering what to do =/ I seem to have lost my appetite since I started working =( 
I need him =( 
I couldn't possibly love him anymore than I already do ... and then I always end up loving him more <3 
The thunder is terrifying ! There's lightning everywhere ! Going to see The Sorceror's Apprentice with < PROPFIRST > :) 
So , The Sorceror's Apprentice wasn't terrible but it wasn't great either . Very cheesy ! Saw my < PROPFEMALE > at work AND after work today =) I love her lots ! < PROPFIRST > and I walked out of Wal-Mart with ANOTHER bag of junk food ... awesome ! I love him lots too ! <3

Can't cheer up today :( 
Can't eat or sleep so I'm going to do something productive like cleaning and re-organizing my room while watching all the movies I bought today . 
Every now and then I get a little bit lonely and you're never coming around Every now and then I get a little bit tired of listening to the sound of my tears Every now and then I get a little bit nervous that the best of all the years have gone by Every now and then I get a little bit terrified and then I see the look in your eyes Every now and then I fall apart ... 
Happy 6 Months < PROPFIRST > ! :) Literally the happiest I've ever been ! I love you so much ! Work 11 - 7:30 pm and surgery for < PROPFIRST > :(

Work again today then going to Brandons house . I really hope he starts getting better soon ! Some families really don't make sense to me =/ 
First migrane in months :'( So much stress . 
The sound of a ball bouncing against a wall is the most irritating noise in the whole entire world and makes me want to scream . 
The worst feeling is having to leave Mummy after her surgery and not being able to stay with my < PROPFIRST > after his surgery =(( 
Got no sleep last night because of that migrane and I still have a headache . My phone is acting up again . Hopefully I sleep tonight . I really miss my Mummy and < PROPFIRST > <3 Nighty night !

These antibiotics knock me out for a couple hours during the day but keep me up all night feeling sick :( Only 5 days left ! 
I miss < PROPFIRST > ! 
The < PROPMALE > of a piece of bread falling with the buttered side down is directly proportional to the price of the carpet . 
I'm convinced these antibiotics are some form of torture . Not being able to sleep doesn't seem like it would help with that whole getting better thing .

From now on I will be getting the flu shot every single year until I die . 
Here's what I think . If there is a God , then you have to assume there is one for each religion . They are probably all hanging out together up there drinking tea wondering why on Earth we fight and discriminate so much . Probably not what they had in mind . 
Is having the hardest time trying to sleep ='(( Flu is the absolute worst thing ever . Get your flu shots ! 
I absolutely cannot stand the little brats that live next door . Do kids ever stop screaming ?! 
I think this flu is actually beginning to go away ! :) I can't wait to have energy again !

If you want to sleep in at a hotel you have to sleep through : the temperature being wrong , the excited screaming children in the halls , the people who speak louder than everyone else , and housekeeping .
