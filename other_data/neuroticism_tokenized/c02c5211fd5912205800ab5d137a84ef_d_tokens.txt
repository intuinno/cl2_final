too much music in my library for my 8gb to handle ... i hate picking and choosing 
Discovered a new artist- all < PROPFEMALE > radio ... Good laid back tunes 
I've lived life like fate controlled everything i did .. like whatever i do , the consequences are irrelevant because thats what is destined to happen . I realized today that living that life style is a lot like giving up on life itself .. is it possible to change a way of life i've lived for so many years ? 
My dvr was set to record lost ... it didnt -_-

Summer school is DONEZO 
If you're too emotional you can look like a fool , if you're too intelligent you might be cruel , but finding the right mix is your happy fix 
people need to try understanding each other , but without perspective knowledge there can be no understanding ... its easier to just take the neutral approach

There are 3 levels of fasting . 1- fasting from food and drink . 2- fasting with the tongue , eyes , ears and actions . and 3- fasting with the mind . Don't settle for level one , you'll only starve yourself . Ramadan is not about deprivation , it's about self revision .
