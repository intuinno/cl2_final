i dont < PROPMALE > y we all < PROPFEMALE > onto something we < PROPMALE > we're betta off lettin go . it's like we're scared to lose wat we really dont have . some of us say we'd rather have somethin than nothing @ all , but the truth is ... to have somethin halfway is harder than havin nothin @ all 
Every story has an end , but in life , every end is a beginning .... 
there's a guy in my life who would die 4 if anythin happened to me , someone who'd go to the ends of the earth to find the boy who broke my heart he's so important to me and ill hurt any1 who hurts him .... 
WOW .... 
Laugh your heart out . Dance in the rain . < PROPFEMALE > the moment . Ignore the pain . Live , Laugh , Love . Forgive & Forget . Life's too short to be living with regrets . 
Be who you are and say what you feel because the ones who mind don't matter and the ones that matter don't 
My life rocks on every level . It's hot , fierce , and full of intense music !!! 
Everything I'm NOT Made Me Everything I AM 
Question of the Day : \ 
When a guy says ' I Love You ' ... does he really know what it means ?? 
People have said that I've changed . The reality is ... I believe I've just found myself . 
Life's about trusting our feelings and taking chances , losing and finding happiness , appreciating the memories , and learning from the past ^.^
