Rain , rain , rain ... great year for the umbrella industry . 

A true friend doesn't care when you're broke , being a bitch , what you weigh , if your house is a mess , what you drive , about your past , or if your family is filled with CRAZY people . Your conversations pick up where they left off , even if they have been months apart . They love you for who you are . Re-post if you have at least one true friend . They will know who they are .

Everyday you're faced with controllable/uncontrollable events & decisions . Some good , some bad & some down right stupid ! Some things just happen . You look back on something you've done or have neglected to do and wonder \what in the world was I thinking ? \ " ( or not ! ) Then you realize that all your wisdom & good intentions were on vacation ... Live & Learn . When your brain goes on vacation ; GO WITH IT ! " 
Happy Easter ! Take time to reflect on all that was lost or on all who have suffered allowing us to be here today with our family , friends and loved ones . Thank you Lord for the ultimate sacrifice , your listening ear and the strength you provide to help us persevere when times aren't so easy to go . Thanks for watching over our travels . Thanks for looking out for us and having < PROPFEMALE > when we take You for granted . 
Sometimes a dream of something you never did is vivid in your mind as if it really happened , especially when you hear a song that says it all !
