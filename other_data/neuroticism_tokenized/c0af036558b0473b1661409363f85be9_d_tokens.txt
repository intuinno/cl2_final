Found out that my wisdom teeth are horizontal impacted . ; n ; Should be taking care of it when I come back from college in winter . 

Wtf ... the left side of my face is numb , I hurt my ankle on an uneven cement step and it's slightly swollen and I thought I just saw my ex in the smoke shop . -_- 
Heading out to college on Monday . Can't wait . * u * 
DUUUDE , there are so many trees here ! 8D it's crowded and awesome and I'm going to get so lost . 
< PROPFIRST > is the fucking most beast person alive ! 
I'll be making a blog soon complete with Hella pictures and such . :3 
How would I describe Arcata without getting long winded ? Let's just say I'm drinking organic , hand-blended chai with rice milk out of a < PROPMALE > jar I got at the Farmer's Market . 
Thank you everyone for the birthday wishes ! :3

So , as usual , I take my laptop to class and turn it on . And full blast starts my Folk Metal station in Pandora . My laptop being stupid and slow , it played for a solid minute before I could mute it . > x > 
Alright , guess I'll do this number game too . I think it's you message me a number and I post here what I think of the person , via their number . I think that's how it is anyway . 
This is some bullshit , trying to do my clothes before leaving tomorrow and they're stuck in the damned machine ! Been trying for two hours to get the thing to open up and nothing . >:[ Worst of all , not a damn thing is open on campus right now ; nothing . 
Why is it , if you put me in an intl ' airport , I get around fine , but if you put me in an airport the size of a large grocery store , I get so lost ? 
So , I'm in LA to go to Disneyland with the family . And , not much has changed . XD 
Great , I'm next to a guy who's CLEARLY afraid of flying . Clearly . :|

Someone's convinced me to Livestream it , so if anyone wants to watch me get scared or wants to see what I do in college , I'll have the link up soon .

To My Wonderful Eppley Family : I love you all . But , you guys have to STOP clicking on links , go to your privacy setting , click Edit settings in Apps and Websites , click remove unwanted applications and REMOVE everything you don't know . It's how you get hacked , and how I see two of my aunts with the same link spam three other people .
