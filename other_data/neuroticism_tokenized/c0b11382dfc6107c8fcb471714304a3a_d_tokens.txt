Please copy and paste this to your status if you know someone , or have been affected by someone who needs a smack upside the head . People who need a smack upside the head affect the lives of many . There is still no known cure for someone who deserves a smack upside the head , except a smack upside the head , but ... we can raise awareness . Many won't copy and paste this . I did . Will you ?

So the US Supreme Court has ruled that you have the right under the First Amendment to protest military funerals ... I invite you to start your protest in my front yard and we can see if your first amendment is better than my Second Amendment ... Re-post if you feel the same .
