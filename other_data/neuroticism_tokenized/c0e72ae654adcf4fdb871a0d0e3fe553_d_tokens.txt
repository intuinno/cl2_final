Last night I was playing Harvest < PROPFEMALE > on the gamecube when I heard explosions from outside . I nearly ducked and covered because I thought it was the terrorists at it again until I realized it was fireworks . Happy new year 

oh god , school tomorrow . Three hours of < PROPFEMALE > screaming like a damn banshee and < PROPFIRST > being hormonal and pregnant . Fun fun fun I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK . 
buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh I'm being forced to go to IDAHO blluggg . 
YEEHAY Freeway driving test today . My last day on earth . So treat me kindly and give me honorary chocolates for giving my life for driver's < PROPMALE > . 
WHYYYYY did I have to be stuck with the smarmy British kid during the drive . 
I just spent four hours cleaning my car . My fingernails are melting from all the cleaners . 
< PROPFIRST > Chaplin's autobiography : Chaplin crying at men in tights doing ballet and a man sucking venom out of < PROPFEMALE > Swanson's tit . Doesn't get much better . 
WHO ELSE IS GOING TO THE CHALK FESTIVAL ?!?!?!? 
RIGHT before you almost faint while playing DDR , you have a sudden burst of AWESOME . I haven't played that well in years , but I think I've lost 90% of my water weight from sweating . 
NO MORE < PROPFEMALE > AND < PROPFIRST > OH MY GOD . I'M SO HAPPY . 
JUST got back from Uptown . What a way to spend the first day of summer : chalk < PROPMALE > with Caiti and < PROPFEMALE > , kittens with hate for mint and absurd amounts of money spent antique shopping . YES . 
Got a ridiculously big Chaplin and < PROPMALE > Keaton collection of DVDs in the mail today . WORDS CANNOT EXPRESS MY JOY . 
UUUUUUU NEED SOME < PROPMALE > IDEAS GUYS . In fact , comment a couple words and I'll goddamn draw it . 
Skip < PROPFIRST > , I can't understand a goddamn word you say . Ever . 
Who else's power went out for two hours ? My family started calling me : \WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON . \"" 
My brother made me watch < PROPFEMALE > Wars Episode I for shits and giggles . What a mockey of the original cinematic masterpieces . 
Guys . Guys . I think I'm dying . I've had the hiccups for an hour . Seriously guys . What's going on here .

HOW DID I FORGET HOW AWESOME GOTHIC COUNTRY IS ?!?! 
It's a shame the film Monsieur Verdoux is so unknown . It's possibly one of the best pictures I've ever seen by one of the world's most famous directors , but no one knows it . 
< PROPFIRST > MAYES DIED A YEAR AGO TODAY . LET US MOURN THE GREATEST MAN SINCE < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > OR < PROPFEMALE > EARHART . AMEN .

Why is < PROPFEMALE > suddenly SOCIAL . I haven't seen her outside from under the beds in days and now she's CLAWING MY FACE AND TAKING OFF MY GLASSES FOR ATTENTION . WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU 
< PROPFIRST > FORMBY , I LOVE YOU . By the way , I'm back . 
I got home and found my computer infested with Malware and a history full of porn . Thanks for looking after the computer , < PROPFIRST > . 
The downside to wearing clothing from 1930 : the chiropractor caused my dress slip's straps to snap . And I'm wearing a transparent lace over-dress . 
< PROPFIRST > and I had a disturbingly in depth discussion about whether Chaplin was a pedophile or not . In your words , What is a Pedophile ? 
Some old man at < PROPFEMALE>'s asked my dad \Where'dya you pick up that pretty lady ? \ " . Old people love me . A lot . " 
Class A ass . Back to square one it seems . 
Makoto Nagano better win Sasuke this time . And yes , I'm saying that just because he's a hot hunk of man meat and I like to see him sweaty . 
And lol at the announcer calling the white guy \the big man \"." 
AUH , today was ungodly terrible . Luckily it's 12:00 AM so I can officially say it's a new day . 
Well , the new day didn't start well . I swallowed my medication wrong , got terrible chest pains which led to a panic attack because I thought I was dying . I almost called 911 . 
In 1921 , while watching The Sheik in theaters , women were known to faint and collapse into the aisles because of how beautiful < PROPMALE > Valentino was . I had to pause the film to keep myself from doing the same . OOH , WHAT A FINE MAN . 
I found a $60 DDR pad at Goodwill for $7 and it works like it's god damned new . THIS IS THE GREATEST DAY OF MY LIFE . 
CONTACTS SOON OH BOY OH BOY OH BOY OH BOY . 
Went antique shopping and picked myself up an issue of Ladies Home Journal ... \ 
from 1897 . 
What's with all the lost Chaplin films showing up lately ? We got Zepped , A Thief Catcher , All at Sea and production stills from A Woman of the Sea . Pretty damn exciting . 
My second child has been delivered : Chaplin Collection Vol . 2 . MY JOY IS UNPARALLELED . 
Reasons to go to Goodwill : I bought a $4.50 illustrating software and I'm now selling it on eBay for $115.50 . 
Whoa . Managed to get $170.50 for the thing . $166 profit is niiiiiiicee . 
Sudden writing inspiration , WHOA . Why can't this happen everyday ? 
gjkkljkls I wish they would stop playing Rock Band so I could go to sleeeeep . hjafhjafalfjahl 
Oh , Bing Crosby . Your voice melts me but then I remember that you were a terrible person . 
Back from < PROPMALE > in the Park . I bought an outstanding hat and met a lot of interesting people . A LOT of INTERESTING people . 
I REEEEAAAALLY wish Facebook had a dislike button . 
According to Sunrise A Song of Two Humans , if you try to drown your wife , she'll still love you as long as you buy her flowers and cry at weddings . Apparently . 
It's almost August and I haven't seen any of my friends ONCE this summer . This has been a pretty shitty vacation . Then I have to go back to that hellhole River's Edge after this is all over with . 
Holy tapdancing Christ . I thought this seller on eBay was a total sweetheart and then they turn out to be a total assmunch via email . Jesus Ch-RIST . 
AWWHJJHHHsfjaklf now I feel like the assmunch . The eBay selling wasn't being rude to me , their English just isn't fluent and I misunderstood what they meant . jdjfklajkldsj NOW I'M THE ASSHOLE . 
I woke up at 7:30 , went back to sleep and now it's 12:30 ?! Last time I'm sleeping without my damn alarm clock . So pissed off . 
I wish summer would just end already , but then I remember that I have to go back to that awful , miserable excuse for a school . Can't I just drop out and hop trains for the rest of my life ? 
AUUUGH , why don't they make movies like they used to ? ( waves old man cane in anguish ) 
AUGHH I LOVE < PROPMALE > TOMASINI . WHY IS HE SO HARD TO FIND . 
Anyone know any time-wasting sites I can go to to preoccupy myself for a minute from my complete and total nervous breakdown ? 
< PROPFIRST > , THE LAPTOP CORD CAME . I just need the password and my sims will no longer be lonely ! 
Prop 8 has been deemed unconstitutional and is now overturned ? DAMN STRAIGHT , LET'S HAVE A CELEBRATORY CAKE YOU GUYS . 
SERIOUSLY PEOPLE . If I see that \I shouldn't have to press 1 for English\ " like again I will strangle you . STRANGLE YOU . You have to press an extra button on the phone because there are people who don't want to live a terrible life in their awfully poor country . Oh BOO 
I'm so damned depressed and I don't even know what I'm going to do about it . \ 
Well , boo hoo , poor me . A middle class white girl is sad , whatever are we all to do . 
Just visited a new vintage shop : Pop Life at 303B < PROPFIRST > Avenue ( thanks < PROPFEMALE > for the heads up ) . Go support local businesses and pay them a visit . 
Just got back from Leavenworth . Totally worth driving for two hours to get there to spend absurd amounts of money . 
Ahhhhh I saw my former teacher at my councelor's today . TALK ABOUT A CRAZY SITUATION ! 
But seriously , it was really awkward . 
I hate it when I open the dishwasher and my glasses fog up , blinding me and making me stumble backwards into the sharp edge of the counter . 
Found Mystery Science Theater 3000 at a yard sale . I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING THIS WEEK ~ ~ 
Will be up in the asscrack of Washington for a few days . See you Wednesday or Thursday , sweet , sweet , internet . 
Hoooooly God I'm back home . For the record , The Windmill Antique Store in Soap Lake is THE best antique shop I've ever been in . I picked up 5 Great War < PROPFEMALE > magazines and a French phone . Awesome . 
Why hasn't anyone fired Quizno's entire marketing team yet ? 
Is it wrong that I find < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > strangely attractive ? It could just be because he's the most badass person alive .

I am so tempted to buy the Erector toy set at Ragtime antiques . 
To all those poor souls who have never seen a < PROPFEMALE > Brothers movie , I pity you . 
I am convinced that ICP are just trolling us . They're sitting back and laughing their asses off at people who take them seriously . THEY AREN'T REAL , RIGHT ? I refuse to think they're serious . 
Am I the only person in the world who likes clowns , mimes and dolls ? :( 
Whaaaat a God damn jerk-off . I want to explode in a fiery rage of fire and rage . 
I wish game shows were still good . :( They're so dark and intense nowadays . Why can't we have more awkward sexual innuendos and the hosts practically making out with female guests like on Match Game ?! 
HEY ! To any of you who go to Hanford : I'm there 6th period and I've seen some people I know . WHY DOESN'T ANYONE RECOGNIZE ME . I'm sad . : '''' [ very very sad 
Oh and I have a zit on my tongue . How does that even happen ? 
Are you serious ? < PROPMALE > Giraldo died ? Whoa . Why didn't I know this ? 
Ahhhh , I'm so sick with this cold . To all my friends , you can have my wallet and Pokemon cards when I die . 
When people think of Washington , they always see rain , evergreens and Seattle . They kind of leave out half the state that is dry , tumbleweeds and , well ... nuclear bomb making .

I can't fix Trip and Grace's marriage in Facade no matter what I do ! When I compliment their house , Trip tells Grace he's having an affair . 
Autochromes really make that old greyscale world seem so modern and real .

Is it horribly , horribly wrong that I like Seona Dancing ?

As I clean , I have realized that I probably have the weirdest god damn bedroom in existence . Dolls , mannequins hanging from the ceiling , clowns , Pokemon and asians ... it's like a nightmare . 
I have been playing The Sims for 7 years , and this is the first time I got twins . ITS AWFUL . I HATE THESE LITTLE BASTARDS . I BET THEY'LL GROW UP TO BE UGLY LIKE MY LAST KID .
