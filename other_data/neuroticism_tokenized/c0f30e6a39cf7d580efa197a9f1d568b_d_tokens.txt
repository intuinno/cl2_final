Holy hell today was boring . I hope it does not get any worse . 
Today Aidan opened up my phone turned on a < PROPMALE > Marley song , then started singing and dancing . To think he is a < PROPMALE > Marley fan at only 2 years old makes me want to weep like a little girl ! Soooo Happy ! 
Oh cruel morning why do you hate me so . Mans one true savior ... coffee . 
Aidan did not sleep very well last night . Then he is smacking me in the head at like 5:50 in the morning , telling me to get up . I don't know where he gets his energy but I sure could use some . 
One good thing about music , when it hits- \ 
you feel no pain - < PROPMALE > Marley 
RIP Grandma < PROPFEMALE > . I'll never forget the < PROPFEMALE > cake , Willies , or those special nuts during the holiday LMAO . You could piss < PROPMALE > off like no other person and it always cracked me up . You will be missed .

Its almost Friday . Thank god , I feel like I'm teaching 4th graders instead of freshman . 
“My best advice to anyone who wants to raise a happy , \ 
mentally healthy child is : Keep him or her as far away from a church as \ 
you can” - < PROPFIRST > Zappa I need to catch up on listening to my Zappa . There is nothing quite like it . 
Thank the good lord the Steeler's season is under way . I feel a tear coming on . 
I had a great time in Mo-town . Thanks to everyone involved . There is nothing like wine , jazz , and somehow salsa music . To top it off a ton of country music in the evening lol . Thanks to < PROPMALE > for the invite . It was heart warming to watch him and < PROPMALE > skip down the road together . 
Hump day .

Steelers win again . 3-0 without Big < PROPMALE > . Defense has looked great , Mendenhall is on a roll . I love these kind of Sunday's , makes me so damn happy ! 
Feel like crap . Thinking that I am coming down with something . One the bright side the Deadskins lost and the Steelers are 3-0 . HAHAHA . 
Suck it < PROPMALE > , the skins stink ! 
Game tonight with Aidan . He gets so excited to see the \kids\ " play . Just hope I don't freeze my ass off . Not sure I am ready for the cold weather again . Don't want any comments < PROPFIRST >." 
Don't take life too seriously . You'll never get out of it alive . I have a feeling this is going to be a good day . 
Steelers 7 Ravens 10 at the half not worried though . Hope the refs can call a better game in the second half . I would have to yell at the TV as much . 
< PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > you are breaking my heart ! 
What a drive 93 yards over six minutes against the Ravens D . God I hate the Ravens . 
Now the Deadskins are going to win . Can my day get any worse ? 
Spent the evening with Aidan . We both had wings and fries . He sure is growing up . 
A man is the sum of his miss fortunes 
RIP < PROPMALE > Brownies . Welcome to the league Colt McCoy . Can not wait for the Steelers game . 
All is right in the world . Steelers win 28-10 . Roethlisberger tosses for 257 and 3 TDs . How could you root for any other team ? 
Had the \Monster Mash\ " stuck in my head all day . I love Halloween . " 
Aidan is dancing again . He says he loves Rock and Roll . 
Playing < PROPFIRST > the train set and watching < PROPFIRST > and friends on DVD . That train is starting to get on my nerves . 
Got to love < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > !!!!!!!!!!!!! Down go the Raiders . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > - 2 sacks 1 Int and 1 forced fumble . Got to love the Steelers D 
Best hockey player in the world ? - Sindney Crosby of course ! He is on fire ! PS Bengals are going down . Time to fire < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST >

Steelers beat the Ravens . Patriots lose . What a great weekend for football .
