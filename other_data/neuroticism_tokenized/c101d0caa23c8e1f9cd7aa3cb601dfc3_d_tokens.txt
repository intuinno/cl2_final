I'm going away for a while , But I'll be back , don't try and follow me , Cause I'll return as soon as possible , See I'm trying to find my place , But it might not be here where I feel safe , We all learn to make mistakes . And run From them , from them . With no direction . We'll run from them , from them . With no conviction . 
Now I'm told that this is life , and pain is just a simple compromise . So we can get what we want out of it . Would someone care to classify our broken hearts and twisted minds , so I can find someone to rely on . And run to them , to them ; full speed ahead . Oh you are not useless . We are just misguided ghosts , travelling endlessly . The ones we trusted the most , pushed us far away . ~ Misguided Ghosts : Paramore 
She wore crushed < PROPFEMALE > , jet black , and to the floor . She rode on angel's wings , that used to shine oh-so bright . Now the dark has caught the spark in her eyes and I , I can't find the air . ( I'll wait for you , I cross my heart ) ~ Dissolve and Decay : Hawthorne Heights 
Happeh < PROPFIRST>'s Day !!! Now go devour those chocolates and < PROPFEMALE > hearts ! X3

It's disgusting , how you changed me . From a bandit to a baby . Thinking about gotta change my name , If I'm gonna walk this walk of shame . Look at what you do to me . It's disgusting . 
My mind blinks like a traffic light . It's greed and red , stop and go ; changing all the time . 
Woot ! Finally finished To Kill a Mockingbird ! Long read >.< ugh .... But it was a pretty good book ! 
How can we start to tackle the problem , If you don't put your hands up , And admit at you're on them . The kids are in danger , They're all getting habits , Because from what I can see , Everyone's at it . 
hmmm what to do now ? What to do .... :/ 
I suddenly feel like playing either Final Fantasy X or Okami ...... o.O 
Woot tomorrow's Friday ! :3 Now , time to go play some Okami ! XD ...... Or actually do my algebra homework .....

It was a Thursday . I decided to take a shower so I could leave for camping in the next hour or so ..... I got out and heard my dad yelling at Ayden . I decided to check it out .... Flabbergasted , I ran down stairs in the basement ....... Turns out Ayden decided to paint \pretty pictures\ " on my mural that I JUST finished 15 minutes before hand ... Moogle was completely covered in paint*sigh * ...... At least I had fun camping ! :D " 
So I'm reading a series called SHAPSHIFTERS ..... Would you rather shapeshift into : A- a hawk ; B : a snake ; C : a falcon ; D: a wolf ; or E : a Wyvern ( type of dragon ) .... I think I would want to be a Wolf .... or a Wyvern :3 
I just so happen to be watching Big Time Rush cos of my little brother .... And I noticed something ..... One of the extras in the episode is the same actor as < PROPFIRST > Cavanaugh from Pretty Little Liars ! :D

Ayden : ** looks around , sways back and forth ** \ 
Me and mom : ** begin to smile and giggle**\ 
Ayden : ** falls forward back to sleep face first**\ 
Me and mom : ** burst our laughing**\

Rubber band dragons ....... Them things mean danger ! Ayden just got hit in the face with one ..... On his own .... 
.... I now want a full pure white wolf furry costume with blue eyes and grey patches on the ears , feet , and tail .....! :D ...... Now just where do I find the money to commission one .... TnT 
Yeah .... I still love How to Train your Dragon's Night Fury , Toothless ..... I still want a hand crafted plushie , too .... The one's in stores freaking suck . >,> \ 
And I haven't seen my sister since last Wednesday ? ( Tuesday ? ) .... I miss you , sister < PROPFEMALE > !! 
Sitting here in my room , listening to The Spill Canvas along with the thunderstorm in the background and knitting something ... I have no idea what it's gonna be , but I've been putting it off for two years now ..... >.> 
Woot ! Mah parents surprised me by buying Naruto : Rise of the Ninja for me today . They said it was present for watching Ayden for the past few weeks ^w^ yay ! :D But the only that makes me mad is that you can only choose between , like , six characters as opposed to the usual 20 or 30 .... 
So it's pretty cool ! There's a perfect Cheshire Cat < PROPFEMALE > outside and < PROPFEMALE > , Mars , and Jupiter are all aligned as well . ^.^ \ 
On another note , why is my internet connection being so effing retarded !?! >.<* Onoffonoffonoff ...... Then it stays off for 45 < PROPFEMALE > then it's on for 10 < PROPFEMALE > s and back off >.> 
Soo .... I've definitely decided that I love < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > ! :D They're amazing musicians and sooooo pretty ! ^.^ I can't stop listening to them 
The Last Airbender actually isn't that bad ! I liked it ! What could be worked on is the acting and making Zuko actually look like Zuko >.> The dragon spirit was prolly my favorite part out of the whole movie haha 
So I just finished watching The Proposal ( which is a very good movie ) ...... And I REALLY want the puppy that was in it ! It was sooo cute ! Small , pure white , and uber fluffy !! ( I think it was a Samoyed pup ) xD 
Ayden : < PROPFEMALE > , I fall down ! \ 
Me : Yeah , I see that . Why'd you fall down ? \ 
Ayden : pecause I didn't want to stand ! ( he prefers using a \p\ " instead of a \ " b \")" 
Yay !!!! My sister's finally home ! ^w^ ** squee ! **\ 
.... And Ayden stepped on the N64 and froze my game .... ** sigh ** 
I've just decided that RP-ing about random crap is the greatest thing in the world ! :D .... 220 comments so far lol

Wanna know a fail ?..... Trying to swat a fly off my shoulder but somehow managing to claw my upper arm open with my thumb nail .... Now it's all red and puffy T^T 
Speed < PROPMALE > in a round-about ........ epic ! xD Also ! I've decided that when I have a house of my own , I'm getting a cat and a Samoyed and I'm naming them Buddha and Moai ^w^ 
I don't think it was the right choise making the voice actor for < PROPFEMALE > the Pooh also be the voice of the Snake on The Jungle Book ..... Anytime I hear it , I think of the BA snake with the power of hypnosis being a little harmless bear who loves < PROPFEMALE > ..... >.> 
First episode of Kuroshitsuji ..... DEFINITELY caught my attention ! ^.^ Sebastion's a cutie haha I believe this is the start of a wonderful addiction/obsession ! :3 
Apparently if you throw a butterknife like a kunai .... It surely means certain death ^.^ Woo ! \ 
\Of course to be a Butler for the Phantomhives .... It's only natural to be able to do this . \"~ Sebastian " 
Finished watching Kuroshitsuji ..... And now it all went too fast !! T^T I nearly cried when Sebby-chan was going to eat Ciel's soul ...... \ 
AND THEN I FOUND SEASON TWO ! CHYEAH !!! ** squeals**\ 
And now I hate Alois Trancy and < PROPFIRST > Flaustus ..... >.<* I shall forever favor Sebby & Ciel ! <3 
Got the make-up to look like Drocell from Black Butler now ! :D And a raspberry malt from Culvers , as well yummy 
Si Deus Me Relinquit from Kuroshitsuji OST = My new favorite song ^.^ 
Yay ! I'ma happy ! I earned an iPod doc for watching Ayden ! yush !! xD And for being good today , he got his 3rd < PROPFIRST > ( toy story ) since he lost the other two .... > w <\" , 201 0-0 8-05 22:32:09 " 
is highly confused after watching Kuroshitsuji 2 Episode 6 ........ the hell just happened ? D:< Ciel had better still be < PROPMALE>'s \Young Master\ " ! >.< And Alois had better die ..... Though I must say the fight of the two demons was quite interesting .... " 
Has an unhealthy addiction to the song \Electropop\ " by Jupiter Rising ..... As well as a certain pairing from Black Butler whilst listening to said song ..... Oh the the joys of being of being a yaoi fangirl ..... xD " 
I feel so very accomplished ! 1000 Gmaerpoints !!! I FREAKING BROKE A DOOR DOWN !! XD I am proud of myself ..... But also very incredibly sorry at the same time lol 
Quick ! Everybody ( or anyone who cares ) Go to these two links and tell me which outfit you like best ! I can't decide for my Ciel Phantomhive cosplay ! T^T \

Ok , so I've figured it out , finally !! I'll buy Ciel's blue suit first . And then , with the money left over , later I'll buy the pink dress ! :D ( No matter how much I want the dress , I'll have to wait .... ) That way , I can have both ! ^.^ 
I <3 Chinese food ^.^ 
I just killed a fly . With the flyswatter . In mid-air . Skills ? chyea ! xD ( pff , not a < PROPMALE > ! >.>) 
So I repainted my fingernails and Ayden walks up to me with a bag of trail mix in his hands and says to me \I like your new fingers ! \ " and walks away .... " 
Has suddenly realized exactly how ADORABLE < PROPFEMALE > clothing is !!!! Is at a website just looking at everything saying to herself \I want that . I want that . OMG ! I so want that ! \ " xD " 
On ze computer .... And listening to some Doctor Who in the background ! xD 
what's with everybody and their sick obsession with this mediocre reality show called \Jersey Shore\ " ?.... christ ... >.>" 
Even though I have no idea who this character is exactly , Ggio Vega has now struck a chord .... x3 .... Same chord as < PROPMALE > haha 
I'm so freaking bored it's insane ! > n < 
Kuroshitsuji Season 2 Episode 7 is now ONLINE ! YES !!!! Time to go watch it now and get the confusion from last week's episode alllll sorted out -w-

My mom totally passed up a < PROPFIRST > Bravo DVD Box Set !!! I'm sad now .... Very very sad T^T ...... I adore that show ! ** does The Monkey ** Cartoon Network sucks these days ...

I . love . Peanut Butter Cups ! ( sang to the rhythm of \I am your singing telegram\ " from CLUE ) :D " 
wow .... I'm really in a The Spill Canvas kinda mood .... I haven't indulged myself in them for quite a while ..... ^.^ 
I love how iTunes goes from playing Seether ... to Rihanna .... and now the Okami OST ..... >.>\" , 201 0-0 8-14 10:27:51 " 
Oh my god ! Ayden just rolled his eyes at me ! >.<* \ 
That little punk ! And I didn't even do anything ! 
If there are any girls out there that want to do some cosplay , let me know ! :D There's two spots open for a Vizard group ( Bleach ) . Them being < PROPFEMALE > Yadomaru and Hiyori Sarugaki ! These roles need to be filled ~ ! 
I love me ice cream sammiches ! <3 
Is it even possible that I could be shivering right now and be freezing cold ?...... \ 
Yes . Yes I could . ** firm nod ** 
\GASHUNK ! \ " .... Clearly the noise a shark makes when kicking down a door .... \ 
So I'm reading about the events for Geek-kon when I come across this line ... \Learn to beat up your friends the safe and responsible way\ " ........ yeah ..... Bring it on ! >:3 " 
So I just completely spazzed out .....! Here I am , minding my own business when I look to my right .... and there it is ! Just this < PROPFEMALE > speck floating down from the ceiling ! Spindly legs and nasty red body hanging there from it's web ...... T^T I hit it with my sketchbook .... and I can't find it .... dunno if it's dead .... O.o Paranoid ? Yes . 
FINALLY HOME ! Today was such a long day ! And I still wasn't even able to NOT watch Ayden T^T ' cept for the short nap ..... But I got to see mah aunt , uncle , and cousin from Massachusettes ! :D And I got sunburnt on my back .... > n < even with sunblock ... 
I really don't think it's a good thing that on a 74 degree day I was wearing a blanket wrapped around me then entire time ... HOW CAN ONE BE THIS FREEZING COLD DURING THE SUMMER ?!?!?! Wearing about 4 layers and a blankie and I'm STILL cold ! Dx 
\If Slowpoke is a Psychic Pokemon ...... Does that mean it can predict the present ?...... \ " \ 
Remember how a month ago I frantically woke up to see Ayden by my side covered in lime green paint ?. . . . \ 
Well today I walk downstairs to see the sight of Ayden bathing his toy cars in RED paint .....! And now there's red paint EVERYWHERE on the carpet floors .... And I ran out of carpet stain remover ....! T^T This makes me very , oh-so very infuriated . 
So I'm on my way to help Ayden go to the bathroom when I catch a glimpse of something on the floor ..... I go to examine it , and find it's a dead mouse ...... I guess < PROPFEMALE > and Sergeant Pepper don't play with dead prey .... R . I . P Little Mousey .. 
Gloom , doom , and hungry 
I'm pretty sure that Deviant < PROPMALE > has become one of my new favorite websites :3 
Kuroshitsuji Season 2 Episode 8 is now up !!! xD WTF is Alois doing alive ?! D: 
My new opinion of Alois Trancy ...... Still freaking crazy , but I don't hate him . My opinion on < PROPFIRST > Faustus , though ...... Remains the same , but worsened 10X more =.= Hate that guy .... >.< 
\I know what I know 
Tasks that I need to do for cons : .... Finish my Valefor Puppet ^.^ \\ 
The butterfly I'm painting is too green and will blend in with the leafy background .... I'm painting with Acrylics soo ...... Does anyone have any suggestions on how to fix it ? 
EWWW !!!! There was another creepy spindly legged spider on the computer screen ! T^T .... Good thing a kleenex box was near by ! :D 
I'm deciding to re-watch Loveless .... I miss Ritsuka & Soubi ! <3 
Oh my goodness ! Meh < PROPFEMALE > Sergeant Pepper just voluntarily jumped into my lap ! That NEVER happens ! Who is he and what he done with my Sergeant ! > w < 
Bahhh ...... I have nothing to do T^T ( I could straighten up my room , but .... pffff who wants to do that ?! xD ) 
Calming down .... calming down ..... ** sigh ** 
Ayden's a dork :3 
So I'm holding this fruit in my hand .... It's called a Rambutan ...... It looks like tumbleweed , smells like hay , and when it's cut open it looks like a grape > w < 
Ayden has the cutest laugh ^.^ And finds it highly amusing when I tickle him with a paintbrush :3 
I should really start charging for commissions -.- 
..... There's a nasty centipede in the bathroom .... Everyone's sleeping and I'm too chicken shit to even bother trying to kill it T^T 
So I feel like talking to someone ... But i'm afraid they'll be annoyed -.- \ \ 
I reaally need to go to the bathroom .... But I don't want to if the centipede is still in there ! T^T Somebody kill it ! D: 
Giant squid eyes disturb me .... 0 . e 
So apparently there's this lady in Juneau and she has THREE Samoyed's!!!! I . Want . One ! >:3 Jealous ....? Very much so ! 
Ayden just said to my mom : \You should buy more Aydens ! * jumps *\" \ 
If you ask me to draw a picture for you , and I send you an email containing said pic when it's done , Don't nit-pick every little detail that didn't turn out the way you wanted it to ! Be grateful that I even bothered to do it after you insulted me ! >.< people these days , jeezuz ! T^T 
Chocolate makes me happeh ^w^ 
So I'm going on 16 and I still love playing on playgrounds ! x3\ 
However , I ended up choking on < PROPFEMALE > Mist and it almost shot out of my nose !!!... Talk about WORST feeling ever ! T^T 
Nuuuu !!! What is the world of Kuroshitsuji coming to ?!?! T^T Ciel Phantomhive ! Get a hold of yourself !!! You are SEBASTIAN'S Bochan ! >.<** 
I love how in anime , someone takes off their glasses and appears COMPLETELY different .... Examples : < PROPFIRST > spears , < PROPFIRST > Faustus , and Meirin -w- 
Hiccups hurt T^T 
Ayden : I wanna watch a movie ! \ 
Mom : Well pick something ! \ 
Ayden : I wanna watch Curious George !! \ 
Mom : Well pick something else !! ( cos we've only seen that how many times this week ) 
Duuuuudde !!! I my feet are freaking murdering me ! But it's okay because today was definitely worth it !!!! A < PROPMALE > Michaelis Wall scroll , a < PROPMALE > Body Pillow , and smexy < PROPMALE > poster -- Fangirl ? Pfff .... What makes you say that ?! ( went through one heck of a < PROPMALE > getting the poster ... >.> < PROPMALE > . Nic . >.<*) 
Oookay .... Now I kinda wish that I bought the Itachi Wall Scroll instead of either the < PROPMALE > poster or body pillow .... T^T\ 
Next time ! I vow to buy it !.... Anime Milwaukee needs to arrive sooner ... 
x3 CapnDesDes is freaking aaaamazing ! > w < He uses the Banjo Kazooie soundtrack for background music ! Chyeah ! 
I have the sudden urge to want to re-read Hush Hush !!! x3 
I just absolutely LOVE how < PROPMALE > Michaelis gets all enthusiastic about being part of a circus ! x3 It's freaking hilarious !!! 
haha .. haha !! Kuroshitsuji is starting to remind me of Clue now !!! xD\ 
\I dun wanna stay in a mansion where a murder took place ! \ " \ 
I've come to realize that I really do like the servants of the Phantomhive mansion ^.^ They're all really adorable in their own ways .. :3 
.... blah :3 
So the preview for the next episode of Kuroshitsuji 2 says I'll probably weep in the next and final episode ...... I don't doubt it T^T\ 
What the heck is going ooooooonnnnnn !!!!!!!!!!!?!?!? > n < I no longer like < PROPFEMALE > Annafellows ... 
Oh noo !!! What am I going to do when Kuroshitsuji is COMPLETELY over and done with ?!!? .... that's just not possible !..... T^T I think I'm going to cry now ... 
I've recently discovered 2NE1 ( about 45 minutes ago , actually ) , and I've officially decided that I really like ' em ! And I'm going to grow my hair so I can get it like Bom's! x3 
2NE1 analysis ..... \ 
Minzy : Has best dancing skills\ 
Bom : Has the best voice ( and the prettiest)\ 
Dara : Has the craziest hair ... \ 
CL : ..... Best actor of the group ? 
Sometimes people just need to stfu or get a slap across the face to make them shut up > n < 
Ayden's a < PROPMALE > goofball x3 And I wuff him ! 
My mom thinks that anyone can have a jet pack for their car in order to travel and get to places faster ...... The only requirement is that their IQ must be ABOVE room temperature ! xD 
WWHHHAAATTT !?!?!?!?! T^T You CANNOT end Kuroshitsuji II like that ! ~!!!!!~!!!!!!!!!!!!!~!!!!!~~!!!!~~ !!! It's just not FAIR !! > n < ** Doesn't help there wasn't any subtitles ..... ** cries in a corner ** .... Ciel and < PROPMALE > !!!!!!! T^T 
Got a new fox tail from the Buckskinner's Encampment ! This time it's white and just a < PROPMALE > longer than the black fox tail . There was also this red fox hat ..... And I really wanted it ... But unfortunately I didn't have $100 to throw away .... 
Ayden : \Mickey Mouse is still on\ " \ 
Thank you everybody for all the \Happy Birthdays\ " !!!! I really appreciate it ! ^w^ You're all awesome :D " 
GUESS WHAT ?! How to Train Your Dragon comes out on DVD on October 15th !!! DO WANT ! xD <3 
I hate when girls take so many pictures of themselves ..... And they have the same freaking face in every single picture or the same exact pose .... For example .... Duck lips/faces >.> \ That ! Gets annoying .... " 
Though when I wear wolf ears and fox tails , I may look rather innocent . But I bet you weren't expecting me to sprout fangs and claws either -w-\ 
Not much of a good day 
Nice to know that my < PROPFEMALE > cat , < PROPFEMALE > , will only sit on my lap and nudge my arm with her face when I'm eating cereal because she thinks I'll give her some ... T^T 
Homecoming = Ahhhmazing ^w^ Just one thing could have made it that much better though ... :/ 
Boots like that make my feet hurt ... T^T

Ayden's laugh is freaking adorable :3 
Slept for an awesome 14 hours ! And had a dream about being a purply-red night fury ! xDD It . was . AWESOME ! :D

\This is a gift 
I like how next to \Pocky\ " it says its category .... ( Food and Beverage ) Apparently you can drink Pocky nowadays xDD " 
even at 5:17 am my parents have to argue -A- Well isn't that great ? > n < 
Of all the things I had to take with me to my grandparent's house ..... most of it are clothes , my ears and tails , and my < PROPMALE > pillow x3 
Currently the most annoying phrases : \Text me\ " and \ " Hit me up\ " oh my god shut up !! You want to < PROPFEMALE > out so bad ? How about YOU take the initiative instead of ordering people to do it for you . Jeez . " 
Just finished watching the OVA for Kuroshitsuji II ....... May I say rather hilarious ? xDD Though Grell Sutcliff makes one freaking creepy Cheshire Cat ! D: 
Even under ideal conditions , people have trouble locating their car keys in a pocket , finding their sell phone , and Pinning the Tail on the Donkey --- but I'd bet my a ** everyone can find and push the snooze button from 3 ft away , in about 1.7 seconds , eyes closed , first time , every time ! 
ish playing Mahjong Tiles and it's kinda aggravating me ! > n < 
I was going to say something at least moderately clever ...... And now I forgot what it was D: 
Yay !! No more dark brown/black hair ! xDD 
owwies .... And this magnesium drink I have to take tastes disgusting ! T^T 
I love you , daddy . . . ! 
Surprisingly had an alright night of sleep , until I woke up and remembered everything . >.>\\"" 
Reading Crescendo and hanging out with < PROPFIRST > Swanson whilst watching vids of < PROPFIRST > Carlin and venting took my mind off a lot of things . So I'd like to thank the author of said book , my bestest friend , and < PROPFIRST > xD 
Today is going by agonizingly slow ..... It feels like it should be 10:00 >.< And I hate it when people say they'll call you back or tomorrow , and they never do >.>\\"" 
Going through old family pictures is suprisingly theraputic in some ways .... Other ways it kind of hurts more ... 
Surprisingly made it through the school day . Thank you all meh bestest friends who helped me and supported me . I give special thanks to < PROPFEMALE > Boden , who walked me to and from most of my classes . I luff you ! :D 
Can people be so nice as to NOT ask how I am ? If I feel like talking about it , that's when I'll talk . Thanks . 
Accidentally slept in .... So I just decided to stay home xD woo ! Now I'm gonna be bored the rest of the day > w < 
\ohhh the magic conch Shell ! Ask it something ! Ask it something ! \ " xD " 
Ayden < PROPFIRST > Radschlag is freaking adorable ! x3 Although he can be naughty and annoying ^.^ 
To non-pet owners who visit our home and complain about our pet : 1 . He lives here , you don't . 2 . If you don't want his hair on your clothes , stay off his furniture . This IS why it's called ' fur'-niture . 3 . I love my pet more than I like most people . 4 . To you he is ... animal , but to ...... me he is one of my kids who is short , hairy , walks on all fours & doesn't talk back ! Re-Post if you love your pet 
So I'm giving Ayden a big bear hug and he goes ... \AH !! My Bladder ! \ " ..... xDDD Like he knows what a bladder is hahah " 
Got my dolphin pastel painting done , just need to spray fix it and put the mat on :3 
It amazes me how my mom always has her phone on the loudest possible volume and the ONE time I try to call her she doesn't seem to notice it -.- 
Today , was a very good day ! ^w^ Except when Ayden was a hassle xD 
Really blah mood -.- 
Oh how talented one must be in order to biff their head on the microwave door when making ramen xDDD 
CACTUAR PLUSHIE !!!! xDD <3 
Suddenly my cheerful mood took a deep crash . It's gone now . 
\Snow White's stitching up your circuit boards . Synapse slipping through the hidden door . Snow White's stitching up your circuit boards .... \ " ~ Blinding : < PROPFEMALE > and the Machine " 
Whisper it like it's a secret , uttered to condemn the one who hears it with a heavy heart ... 
Did you ever stumble across a picture that's so amazing you just can't seem to put it into words ? Yeah , that happens a lot on Deviant < PROPMALE > ^w^ 
Nuuu !!! Poor < PROPMALE > !! Dx << Lord of the Flies , in other news , its an incredibly good book ! If you can focus and actually keep up with what's happening xD 
What I currently love about ice cream .... It's good for scratchy sore throats and merciless coughing :3 
According to Cyanide & Happiness , there is now a Whenwolf , whywolf , and whowolf xD 
Happy Thanksgiving , everybody ! Eat until you're so full you have to waddle :3 
How the heck does one draw in a \bird's eye view\ " ? It's highly difficult >.<" 
owwies .... mah tummy ! D: Hardly had any room for pie haha xD 
After choking on a dinner roll , Brennon Radschlag has told me that it's not a good idea to use food as a substitute for air . Thanks for the advice xD 
Needs the PS2 so she can play Shadow of the Colossus like ... right NOW ! > w <

Needs to find two more shirts to screenprint by friday xD I is excited ! 
So I've been listening to Ayden cry , scream , and whine about wanting ice cream ....... for the last hour and a half . The kid needs to just chill out ! Dx 
I've come to the conclusion that I hate middle schoolers today when riding the bus . Other than that , I don't want to see so many sad faces at school . I hope everybody feels better soon . 
I really don't like it when people try to be all ' philosophical ' in their facebook status ' and not give credit to the person who said the quotes -.- Or , you could at least take the time to do this \.....\" < yeah ! Quotations ! >.<" 
Help , I'm alive , my heart is beating like a hammer ~ Metric : Help I'm Alive I'm pretty sure this song can be about zombies xD 
< PROPMALE > Michaelis ' voice is supposed to be sexy and deep . What are english voice actors thinking ? Dx 
Today was a very good day ^.^ 
I hate middle schoolers >.> And some people just need to learn to leave me alone ! 
Ayden just told me he's too shy and that I can be his < PROPMALE > ! xD I love that kid !.... When he's not a holy terror ^w^ 
Grr .. Todaaayy ...... could have been a much better day >.>\" , 2010-12-07 21:18:11 "

First SkillsUSA competition in about 45 minutes .... Nervous ? Oh yes . No idea what to do ? Hell yeah . Free pizza ? I'm there ! 
Mah neck hurts Dx And got some awesome animal crackers at Skills haha 
Don't you hate it when you're reclaiming your screens and you suddenly have a nosebleed ? xD 
Why is it when you try to make something work out right for someone else , there's always got to be something getting in the way and making things complicated . >.< 
Is feeling pretty apathetic * big sigh * 
Does anyone know what it means when you dream of an Incubus version of the person you love shoots you in the forehead because they're forced to and then you have a nosebleed and die and reawaken as a zombie with big frizzy puffball hair ? Cos this dream confuzes me xD 
If I was a computer right now , my status would be \System Stand By \"...." 
This computer has WAY too many technical issues and likes to test my < PROPFEMALE > >.<* 
Don't you find it amazing how people will take 150 photos of themselves and decide to post 53 of them on facebook ? The catch is ..... EVERY PICTURE LOOKS THE SAME minus really crappy editing ~ ! * insert sarcastic smile here *

Is a zombie 
Ayden's wearing his Toy Story Halloween costume and is proclaiming that I am Bullseye . I was walking around the house on fours while Ayden was being the cowboy of the movie riding his steed haha xD 
wish i could tell if I was bipolar or not > 3 > 
Should I use this extra time after a day full of exams for a nap or a good movie ? :3 
\Be careful with me ! I'm a piece of breakable ! That's dangerous ! \ " ~ Adorable quote from Ayden < PROPFIRST > Radschlag xDD " 
Kyaaa ! More zombies in Kuroshitsuji ! > w < yayayay !!! x3 
My mind is running in slow motion , I hope I can focus on my last exam today : C 
It feels like someone impaled my chest with a pair of pliers and is now twisting the organs around with it T^T 
If your Dad is or was your hero , your best friend , or just the best Dad ever , if you are blessed to still have your Dad or if he's an angel in heaven , paste this in your status and let everyone know you are proud of your Dad and that you LOVE him dearly . You can replace a lot of people in the world but you only can have one Dad . I love you Dad ? 
< PROPFIRST > Pilgrim vs . The World is so ridiculous , I love it x3 
I want some pancakes with eggs and hashbrowns and orange juice . v.v but we don't have any of those things 
Has watched Howl's Moving Castle , Spirited Away , Panyo , and is now watching < PROPFEMALE > Mononoke x3

Well , last night's compilation of dreams was rather interesting . < PROPMALE > and Ciel were in them xD Along with a bunch of other crazy stuff :P 
I think .... I think I'm going to use some fabric paint and markers and paint some Kodamas on my pants xD Along with those soot creatures and paper birds from Spirited away :3 
But I don't wanna go to go school tomorrow v.v 
People have absolutely no boundaries . 
I hate it when I'm reading something , but my mind is off somewhere else , and I don't process what it's about and then I have to read the whole thing over again Dx 
Goodnight world :3 
How does one completely lose a pair of pants ? I don't know , but I did . And I need them to paint on D: 
Ayden just called me a cutiepie xD haha

Cool guys don't look at explosions xD 
Nice hot cappuccino + Ice cold winter day = delicious warmth 
I love my little brother , Ayden < PROPFIRST > Radschlag :3 He is one adorable kid :P 
I hate biting into a strawberry and having to cringe because the center is too cold and shocks my teeth T^T But they're so good 
I wish my daddy was here 
I think the most exciting part about today isn't the Superbowl ..... But the food I get to eat while barely partially watching it xD But I hope the Packers win , cos then my daddy-o would be the happiest person . He'd still probably be cheering them on from where he is now :3 
My hair matches Valentines Day :3 
Ayden told me I can't teach him all the time , it's time to settle down so I have to stop . xD He also gave me a < PROPFIRST>'s Day card :3 I love my brother > w < 
After I graduate high school I'm moving to New Zealand , no questions asked :3

Usually drawing and listening to music helps to get my mind off of things .... but it doesn't seem to be working today . . . 
15th OF MARCH BE HERE RIGHT NOW !!!! Okamiden here I come :DD 
Feels as though something has changed drastically and there's not much she can do to fix it ..... Even though she wants to so badly 
I don't particularly care for when onions take a liking to stinging my eyes T^T 
Brownies are delicious :3 But boo to mondays > 3 > 
Ayden finds it rather exciting climbing over the back of my chair and digging his hand into my shoulder while doing so x.X 
Just suffered from a mother load of a nosebleed T^T Puddle .... A puddle of blood in the kleenex ! Dx 
Is going to be a harlequin for halloween ; got it allll planned out :D 
Has vowed to NOT get any more short hair cuts ! >.<

Boring three day weekend ... Away ! * points like a superhero * ...... T^T * whimper * 
I hate it when you're talking to someone , and you're in a mellow mood , yet the person you're talking to is speaking loud enough to travel across an entire auditorium with ease , and you're all \OMG SHUT UP ! \ " in your head .... " 
Avacado and < PROPFEMALE > face masks feel awesome > w < 
I don't get the whole war between the Japanese Godzilla and the American Godzilla . They're two different takes on the same awesome creature , I don't see why people have to make such a HUGE fuss over it . If you like Godzilla , then you'd appreciate both of them -A- 
I GOT MAH LAPTOP BACK !!!!!! Yussss > w < 
the one thing I don't like about asking to go somewhere , is I have to play 20 questions with my mom -.- \ " , 2011-03-15 00:29:12 "

People really shouldn't destroy other people's work setups in the < PROPMALE > room . -.- Thanks for spilling my water all over my paint , I REALLY appreciate it . 
I kind of wanna watch The Lion < PROPMALE > and Coraline .... but I have to get up early > 3 > Okay I really wanna watch Coraline though xD

Loooonnng boring day v.v My collage in draw studio is definitely not going to be done by friday T^T

Just had several hysterical conversations with < PROPFIRST > Swanson during a drive to and from Walmart xD I'm surprised you had not slit my throat , I thanketh thee xDDD Also , OKAMIDEN ! 
So yeah I'm chillin ' playing Okamiden and such and then I get low battery . I'm in the middle of a boss fight and my DS dies on me . Fantastic . v.v I can't find my charger either xD 
I tore the house apart looking for my DS charger . I think it grew several pairs of legs and ran away v.v Kinda like a centipede . But if it was a centipede it would find me and bite me . DS charger , where did you go ? T^T 
Wish I took more pictures of the Desert Dome v.v But on the plus side , I got me a monkey plushie that attaches around the neck xD Ayden finally got to burn out some energy too 
the soundtrack in Okamiden sounds like a mix of Okami , Final Fantasy X , and Legend of < PROPFEMALE > xD I lurv it 
Is there anything that stops the train of thought completely before it makes someone go insane ? > 3 > Cos Chocolate didn't do it . And laughter to the point where I can't breathe right helped quite a bit 
Ayden's acting like he's going through a drive-thru xD 
laugh laugh laughity laughy :3 Good day today ! :D 
No . More . Acrylics . EVER . 
Mommy bought Tangled ! yay ! :D Thank you mommeh :3

Just saw ( and freaked out over ) a spider crawling near my bed and was larger than a quarter ! >.<**** I'm scared now T^T 
Is purposely distracting herself so she doesn't have to do homework > w > 
Foo Dog mask = Amazingness :P Just gotta put a little more detail on and add the ears ; fire it ; and it'll be ready to paint ! :DDDDD But know Mr. Graz it'll take 2 weeks to fire it > 3 > 
OMFG !!!!!! STOP SHOUTING ! T^T 
how cool is it if I had dream that included God of War , werewolves , zombies , colossi of all sorts , hellhounds , demented thugs , and being part wild cat ? Oh yeah , pretty freaking awesome > w > 
trying to solve a 1000 piece puzzle on the carpet with ayden in the same room is near impossible , but I'm determined >.< 
doesn't know if she wants to take a nap or watch Phantom of the Opera :/ Either way a three year old who's name starts with A will still be a distraction -.- 
Boy I sure do like to blow my nose while my account is unguarded . < PROPFIRST > Swanson has some sexy calves . And he is sexy himself . I idol him as a God if I wasn't agnostic . 
April showers bring May flowers ^.^
