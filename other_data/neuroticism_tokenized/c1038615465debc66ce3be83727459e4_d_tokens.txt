“First they came for the Communists , and I didn’t speak up because I wasn’t a Communist . Then they came for the Jews , and I didn’t speak up because I wasn’t a Jew . continued 
Then they came for the trade-unionists , and I didn’t speak up , because I wasn’t a trade-unionist . Then they came for the Catholics , and I didn’t speak up because I was a protestant . --- continued 
Then they came for me , and by that time no one was left to speak up . ” -- < PROPFIRST > Niemoeller still true today --- pass it on ! Please Speak up !

I am cheering that Prime Minister Netanyahu did not keep quiet and he clearly explained many of the issues that have been being twisted by many people ! I have spent a great deal of time researching these issues and my findings agree with his stated position . Important stuff ! I hope many of you will read or listen to this one speech . Well worth your time .

If any friends would like to support , now , my translation project -- send end of the year donations to St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church , 4800 Belmont Park Terrace and put a note in saying that the donation is for the Dinka Translation Fund . 
I am pray Jesus will open heaven and provide --- it is indeed scary looking into his face not having a clue how He is now going to support my family ---- Jesus has had it in the able hands of < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > for 39 years --- The Dinka Project to continue and our regular support needs all the financial help of all its friends -- wow I said it --- it is now out there . 
So today is try to figure out how to keep my kid in college --- aggh this is all heavy- Asking Jesus to show me the way ! My resources are Him and I get to figure out how that really works in reality -- < PROPMALE > and the widow with the flour comes to mind ... Again how does that really work !?? Lord open my eyes ~

It goes to my official support . I hope that helps anyone who would like to help .

Just returned from Minneapolis from a election of the SPLM Party Chairman for the whole US . I was an official observer . It was an exciting election . The winner was Mangok Mangok Mayen a friend of mine from Mississippi . I was honored to be part of the process .

Hello all -- the 40 day Memorial for < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > on Saturday 6 Feb10 has been cancelled due to the Sudanese Community dealing with the sudden illness and subsequent hospitalization of one of its members . < PROPMALE > Kuoc Tong has been in Vanderbilt for a number of days now . The community is overwhelmed with the responsibilities and cannot do another thing . Soooo we are cancelling . 
The service for < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > was awesome and a real honor to him . I will miss him . 
Just trying to keep my reality together --- whew ! 
after Jery Smith's sermon this morning and in honor of < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > from the Bible -- I have to add , indeed , there are no giants in Sudan even though there are very tall people ! 
tough < PROPFIRST>'s Day -- still love the guy Once he sent me a card that said -- < PROPFEMALE > you are a red heart and I am a blue one and together we do make a wonderful color of purple !!! 
Jieng is such and interesting language ! 6 million people speak it . I am excited about the concept of newspapers and cellphones having all the symbols needed when the work I do with the Jieng is through ! 
There are more than 6 million Jieng speakers in the world ! 
That Jesus < PROPFEMALE > ---- still is < PROPFEMALE > awesome --- I keep contemplating the depth and breadth of that fact ..... He is Alive and I am forgiven and heaven's gates are open wide ! It does not get old ! Resurrection Day and Life ! Joy ! 
I just spent the day helping the Sudanese arrange for a funeral- one of the fellows ( age 33 ) was shot on April 20 , 2010 sometime- his body was found in the morning at 42nd and < PROPFEMALE > . 
Sad -- there will be a visitation at St. B's Friday night between 5 pm- 7 pm and Saturday morning 11 am -1 pm and the funeral will be at 1 pm -- that is at St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church . The burial will follow and directions will be given at the funeral . All are welcome ! This young man ( Malith Weik ) came to Nashville to get freedom and to be safe from being shot -- what a travesty ! 
Well -- for me celebrating the gift of life we have and the gift of the life of those who have died is the important part . That someone lived is the salient part -- where they walked- their smile- their acts of kindness -- sometimes even their grouchiness , as it was sent our way for a good reason ---- their life and our own are gifts -- not an annoyance --- living that goes a long way ! 
hello -- just got home- < PROPMALE > got his summer doo today -- looks like a skinned rat but he is cute with his Mother's day neckerchief on ! 
Memorial Service tomorrow at St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church Nashville , TN for Malith Wiek -- this is the traditional memorial service usually held three days after the burial . All are invited- 1pm until ----- in the gym 
It rained --- means God told the Sudanese today that He is with them and Powerful and that Malith is okay and in Heaven . The strength of the storm speaks of what a good man Malith was ! 
It is amazingly quiet in Nashville -- y windows are now open and it is soooo peaceful tonight- the temperature is wonderful as well !
