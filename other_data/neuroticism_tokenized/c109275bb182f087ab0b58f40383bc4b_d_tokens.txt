Words\ 
can break someone into a million pieces , but they can also put them \ 
back together . I hope you use yours for good because the only words \ 
you'll regret more than the ones left unsaid are the ones you use to \ 
intentionally hurt someone . maybe it'll come out wrong , and you'll walk \ 
away embarassed but I think the words you stop yourself from saying are \ 
the ones that will haunt you the longest . 
Wow , I hope today gets better . 
Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do . So throw off the bowlines . Sail away from the safe harbor . Catch the trade winds in your sails . Explore . Dream . Discover . - < PROPFIRST > Twain
