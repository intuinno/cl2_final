1 more week ! can't wait ! 
sometimes my life is flipped u ? op ? p ? sdn :) 
I've made mistakes in my life . I've let people take advantage of me and I've expected way less than what I deserve . But I've learned from my bad choices and even though there are some things I can never get back and some people who will never be sorry , I know better next time and won't settle for anything less than what I deserve . 
real eyes realize real lies . 
\Be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind\ " - Dr. Seuss " 
Do you ever look at a photo of yourself and see a stranger in the background ? It makes you wonder how many people have photos of you . lol 
it's hard when you like someone and you don't know if you should trust them or not from things you have seen them do or heard them say or things that they have done in the past or in the present . 
If I had the power to control time I would stop it when I'm with you because those are the best moments in time that always end up going away . I would stop time so I could have more time to finsh things that I started . I would go back in time and prevent things that happened to not happening at all . Unfortunately I don't have that power so for now I just have to go on living life the way I'm suppose to be . 
Life is about trusting our feelings and taking chances , losing and finding happiness , appreciating the memories and learning from the past . 
I'm not a musical instrument so you can stop playing with me . 
Not going to prom . Might go < PROPFEMALE > with < PROPFIRST > and sleepover ?!? who knows . For those who are going to prom have fun and hope it doesn't rain again . :)

We are all books containing thousands of pages and within each of them lies an irreparable truth ...

Backstabber . Can't trust anyone around here anymore . Can't wait to go to Oregon 
senior photos at 3:30 ! 
My life has finally taken the right road . Happy . Enjoying life . And having the best damn time of my life ! ? 
To be trusted is a greater compliment than being loved 
happiness doesn't mean everything is perfect , it is appreciating what you do have & accepting the parts you cannot change !! 
is moving .
