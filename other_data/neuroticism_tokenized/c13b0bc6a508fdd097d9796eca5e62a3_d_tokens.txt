IMMA FREEZE YO COOKIES , BIACH !

Bleh we ran 7.7 today all the way to white flint , so pretty hardin the rain and 55 degrees , but there were 6 big hills that our coach made us actually speed up on -- to about racing pace -- that made it even worse . 
saw Letters From Iwo Jima . It was a really good movie . 
< PROPFIRST > , formerly TheGuyWithTheLongPonyTail , is now < PROPFIRST > , TheGUyThatDecidedToCutHisHairAndMakeEveryoneWonderAboutHim 
I apologize if my hyper metabolism causes me to fall short of your pre-conceived notions of the weight of a perfect human body . 
just realised that i have an 89.5 in math and a 79.5 in history . My < PROPMALE > is open for sucking right about now . 
is the fastest freshman in the county and in regionals , with a 17:32 time yesterday on a really hard course cuz i was pacing with < PROPMALE > simpson the whole time . ( at the end of the race , he told me that he was pacing with me ) The only freshman in the recent past that got a better time than me and < PROPMALE > ( who only lost to me by a few hudredths of a second ) was < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > three years ago . 
Ah , the good ol ' days , when a quarter only cost a nickel . 
some people at the metro were making a scene , so the cops came and tasered one of them . They ended up arressting three people and forcing them to the ground and searching them . It was pretty sweet . 
SWEET you can see me and < PROPMALE > Simpson like raping the damascus guy at the finish from about 2:45 to 3:05 http://www.runningmaryland.com/video/video/4012 
So we threw a frozen baby off of the bleachers and it was awesome when it exploded . 
Awww yea state xc meet tomorrow . 
States , a course with many large hills and already thin grass , is going to be just wonderful tomorrow during our race after four days of raining and three races before us . 
got 23rd in the STATE xc meet at Hereford today with a time of 18:17 on a hard , muddy course . Einstein was 9th school in 3A , and we were only 4 points away from 8th ( we got in the 200's ) . I ran with < PROPMALE > Simpson for the first 2.5 < PROPMALE > , but from then on there's more downhill , and he's better at those . He got 18:03 , but in those 14 seconds he got 12 places better than me . 
Mah time at states ( I'm in the fourth set of times ) http://www.mocorunning.com/meet.php?meet_id=1265 
AT states yesterday I wore 5/8 inch spikes . I could actually feel them going into the ground with each step I took . My first mile was 5:40 . My second two < PROPMALE > were 6:26 and 6:11 , which shows you how hard the middle and end of the course were . < PROPMALE > was even with me through the second mile , but after that there were more downhills ( which he is better at ) , so his last mile was 5:57 . 
woke up this morning not feeling so good , and then I remembered that I don't have to run competitively for another three and a half months . 
First thing I learned at dive practice : how to do a one-step hurdle . Second : three-step hurdle . Third : pike dive . Fourth : It hurts LIKE A BITCH . 
just tasted some espresso < PROPFEMALE > ale and it was amazing , yet very , very unusual .

had a really good front 1 SS compared to what I've been doing , my inward dive was ok but i've done better , my front dive was horrid , and my basck 1 SS 1/2 twist was more like a back 1 SS 3/4 twist but was really good considering that this was the first time i did it in 2 1/2 weeks . Oh , and my goggles came off in my dive for the 400 free relay .

So there was a large , female group chat earlier this year about my HAIR ? That's either awesome cuz they're talking about me or depressing cuz they're talking about my hair , not me . 
Just for clarification : Any group or < PROPFEMALE > that offers an application on the Facebook home < PROPFEMALE > , such as epic fail buttons , dislike buttons , different color schemes , etc ., IS COMPLETE DUMBSHIT . They're spam . Shit . Retarded . Idiotic . You get the point . By the way , I will unfriend anyone that sends me a suggestion for one of the < PROPFEMALE > s or groups . 
CHRISTMAS TOMORROW !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
My eleven year old brother still believes in < PROPFEMALE > . 
I believe some form of static electricity built up in my headphones and was consequently discharged in my ears .

Learned an inward flip and a reverse flip today . This week , I've done three backflops , a belly flop , a ball flop , scraped my knees on the bottom of the pool , scraped my feet on the board , and cut my lip . 
My fucking retarded dad brought my bass and amp home after band practice this week , and left it in the car . I assumed , with good reason , that he just brought inside and left it in a back room . But instead , he fucking left my $600 , new , ACOUSTIC bass outside in the car in tempuratures that went from below freezing to 50-some since MONDAY . WHAT THE FUCK ?!?!?!?!?

Homies be crampin up my style .

Will someone please explain to me the purpose of running plays ? So far , only 3 of the 14 ones I have seen actually gained yards . And one of those was less than a yard .

I have contacts with channel 9 news , and they're expecting 12-20 inches of new snow tomorrow . 
I dunno bout you guys , but I think the new Facebook is actually pretty sweet .

My opinion is that if a girl hits a guy , it is perfectly fine for him to hit her back . Now while that might not be classy , she deserved it , and it would be sexist to say that you can't hit a girl . That would be suggesting that they can't defend themselves . Your thoughts ? 
One of the US figure skaters spun so quickly that she got a bloody nose .

Some lady on the train kept asking me if I liked ____ , and only after I said yes to get her to walk away did I realize she said weed . She then asked me if I wanted to learn french , as well as a few other things that I couldn't distinguish from her constant mumbling .

Damn power keeps going out . 
No running or anything for two weeks , and physical therapy twice a week for those two weeks . I have a minor fracture and a few strains in my knee , but it's not very bad . 
The Mikado was so freakin random . I understood about half of it . 
No , Facebook will not start charging money for use . No , Obama is not going to extend school two hours or onto saturdays . No , you obviously have no understanding of the word gay , which refers to sexuality , and not that random dude online being an idiot . No , that girl was not driven to suicide by that status . No , that random celebrity did not ______ with his/her ______ . Does that clear it up ? 
Is the Tea Party an actual movement , or just a media sensation ?
