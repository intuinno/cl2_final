I'm going to oregon 

WRite now I'm just surfing the web and relaxing . It's nice to have the time to do things that would normally take a couple of minutes and do them in a couple of hours ; I'm savoring every minute of it ! 
I changed my pick because it didn't look very appropriate . 
Well , there is a lot on my mind but I really don't think people want to hear ALLLLLL of my random thoughts . 
I went to fast track ( a preview orienation for my school ) and it was so cool . I though I was going to be too shy to meet new friends but it seems as if it were impossible not to . There was little events here and there and they were kinda cool , especially with the leader we got , she was kinda quirky ( in a good way ) . Well , hope you guys are having as much fun with your school stuff ! 
My sleeping pattern is like way off now . I sometimes forget what time of day it is because I'v been waking up at odd hours . 
Who , if available , would be interested in seeing some Khang comic books ? If so , add some comments on how any of you would like to see Khang as . What would you image Khang doing in a comic book ? What would you not want to see him doind in a comic book . Any opinions are welcome . We need some brain storming . 
I hate it when you draw stuff and later you think it's the most horrible thing in the world 
Why am I sleepy in the daytime and not at night no matter how hard I try to get tired in the day time so I can sleep ? 
I'm swimming in my kiddie pool with my dog . It's fun ! 
Going to Oregon tommorrow ! I am so excited ! The only thing is I am going to miss my dog SOOOOOOOOOOOO MUUCH !!!! 
Going to Oregon tomorrow ! I am so excited ! The only thing is I am going to miss my dog SOOOOOOOOOOOO MUUCH !!!! He knows I'm leaving 
came back from orgeon ! it was awesome ! although it would have been better if my aunt didnt go because she can be such a pain . She's a nagger but what can you do 
Is anybody else getting head aches because of lack of sleep ? I am so getting head aches ! You'd think that would make me sleep earlier . NOT ! 
People are too distracted with life's troubles that they stop seeing the\ 
good things that happen . I feel that as people we have become too \ 
focused on life's faults jsut the way we are too focused on our own \ 
faults . Get over it people , if you aren't perfect what makes you think \ 
that others will be , that the world will be ? 
\You are the opposite of what you pretend to be \"- Me " 
I declare August 11th to be National Beat Khang to a bloody pulp day ! Who ever acknowlodges this holiday please leave a like . 
The more likes , the more Khang shall suffer ! SUFFERR !!! 
*) 
First day of school august 26th ! So cool yet nerve racking 
I'm watching a fighting movie and I am kinda interested but not really . It's alright though 
I only like to watch fighting movies when I am with people who are really into them 
Oh yeah ! the best news ever ! my runaway turtle came back after months of being away ! Yesterday was like the happiest day of my summer . I missed her so much ! 
I just found out there's a Concordia in Portland Oregon . I might go there for a semester . I have family over there so I can crash at their place Right < PROPMALE > ? I am so siked for all the adventures ! 
I can't wait to use all my school supplies and clothes ! It makes me feel like a little kid every time when I go back to school shopping . I still get excited everytime ! :) 
Keep close friends close . Many friends might come and go but if you take care of thosewho trully like you for who you are you are never going to be without a friend . Alot of people claim to have alot of friends when in fact they can be the lonliest of people . Being surrounded by alot of people is not the same as having a lot of friend . 
Most of the people we call our friends are only there when they need you , when they don't have anybody else to be with , when they are bored , etc . Real friends are not only there when they need you but when you need them , when you are alone , when you don't have anybody to be with . 
Today I find out the results for whether I got into Concordia Choir , Women's ensemble , or Worship Team . I really would like to get Concordia Choir because besides the learning experience it would lend me they go to Hawaii in the Spring on tour . Wish me LUck ! 
I got in !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
sometimes i get so nervous that i forget how to talk . i don't get it . it happens sometimes but not all the time 
but once i get to know someone and they are willing to be my TRUE friend i am here for them for anyhing . i hate \friends\ " who just use you and don't bother to < PROPFEMALE > out or anything . " 
< PROPMALE > . I am going to force feed you estrogen pills . FORCE FEED !!! 
wait . nevermind Bryan . Just make sure to eat food treated with the pesticide Atrazine . 
Muahahahahah ! 
I hate the fact that English is so inconsitent . Fall the RULES they say but they spell as if they intentionally don't want you to remember the words 
It's funny how we underestimate ourselves in everything and how when we do things right we surprise ourselves 
At school doing hw in the library . Funny how college libraries are actually quite except for my loud typing . 
I got so lost today . All day everything was going peachy unitl the last class of the day . For some reason I suddenly thought it was thursday . So , I was waiting to go to my thursday class that started at 3:30 pm but when I got there ( by the way , out of breath cause I couldn't find it ) there was nobody there except theses two girls . So , I asked them to help me with m schedule . 
They pointed out that it was tuesday today and suddenly the light went off . I thanked them and went running to my chem lab that had started at 2pm ! And to top it all off we had two tests that day . I finished on time . Thank God , you are good to me . I thought I was going to get in so much trouble but she just laughed at me . She probabl thought \ What a spacey person . \ " I agree . I am . * mentally slaps herself * " 
It ;s nice being so ahead on my HW . THe gaps between classes help me out alot 
i AM SO sleepy ! haven't been able to sleep in days and today I had a morning class at & 7ish . I'm at school to long . I want to go to sleep so badly ! 
IT's funny what guys and girls say about a girl cutting her hair . A girls says \ IT looks SO CUTEE !!! \ " but a guy says \ " what the @#$% !!!!! \"" 
I was just remembering a time I went to church with this super short hair wig . Everybody got all spooked . They thought I cu my hair . They all had these \ what did you do ?! \ " shoked faces . IT was so much fun ! " 
I hate restless nights . can't sleep . Don't know why . So many thoughts going throught your mind . And the worse part is I'm not conscious of those thoughts . 
Just because you believe in something doesn't shut you off to the rest of the world . You are still free to make up your own mind about things , adding or taking away from what you believed was true along the way . People who think that you are closed minded are closed minded themeselves because rthey believeyou will never change . Change is inevitable , whether you change lsightly or dramtically is another question 
It really pisses me off when people are so hard headed that they aren't open themselves to seeing what you see but they want you to believe what they see . I believe in alot of things others don't believe them yet I still enjoy hearing what others believe . I think it is very interesting to see what others believe just for the sake of knowing my surroundings . 
I never knew how muchI hated excel until I started using it now . 
bio and chem are ok . it's just all piles up 
I finally Got everything . From now on I'll never forget how to use excel . 
Research paper due monday ... *'( 
Me and my doggy will be taking a nap now . goodnight . oh yeah and I am finally going to start doing some physical activity . 
that is ... after I sleep 
Lovin ' Concordia !

I'm back . two hours runnin/jogging and I am beat ! My feet are so heavy ! Going to keep on doing this from now on . I feel tired but great . 
I'm so happy today . Don't know why but I just am . 
Is there anybody who knows how to make a historgram out of only having hte standard deviation and mean ? I am so lost . never done this before 
nevermind . I understand now 
I tried running faster to day ... guess how that worked out :( 
WEAK WEAK WEAK ! * beats herself on the head * 
I hate having a mental block . 
I ate some lasagna and I am sleepy now . I so feel like < PROPMALE > 
WHy do I have to be so darn discreet ? SOmetimes I am so disreet people don't get what I am trying to hint at . * deep sigh * 
I am kinda sad right now . 
missing hat . blue beret 
went to look for hat . didn't find it . 8 ( 
Might get a car ... it in God's hands now . I wonder what kind of driver I will be ... * swerves off road * 
I just found out yesterday that < PROPFIRST > beiber is 16yrs old ! NO FREAKIN WAY !!!! 
going to sleep now . I'm surprised I'm still awake seeing as I only got two hours of sleep last night . 
Just came back from taking biology test ... hopefully I did well 8 ( . I would gladly accept a barely passing grade . 
I am calm once more .... I am going to clean my ROOM !! so excited ... nOT ! 
Research Papers are no fun ... 
' m so sleepy .... 
feeling sick ... 
My fingers are stiff from playing the guitar after not having played it for a couple of years . 
In chem class and I am so freakin bored . I've decided to just read the book and not listen anymore . The book makes more sense . I am so weird ... I know . 
I am a bookworm . books make more sense to me than people do . 
I am going to take a 10 minute nap . 
i'm going to extend my nap unitil 8:30 
my nap has been extended some more ... 
nap is officiallly over 8 (

Latley I have been getting alot of energy bursts at night . It's the music . I just get so hyped and happy 8 ) . everything has been going well and I am so happy and thank God for my life everyday . even if it may seem like a crappy day it is always better than I deserve . 
Why doesn't my body make a choice already and get sick ! I am in and out of a cold . I'd just rather be in it then out . 
I went to sleep with two very tightly worn pig tails and woke up with a shaggy mess of hair with only one hair band . HOw does that happen ? 
Going to have some one on one turtle and doggy time . I have neglected them because of school . might go walking to random places ... maybe later might go to LA or something or the pier . I needed this relaxing vacation . 
I did something devious right now and can't keep from laughing cause I can't say anything about it but I will eventually . * lol x infinity * 
i just finished watching \ 50 first dates\ " and I am literally crying . having a girl moment . " 
8 ( 
going to the moves with the family . *) . maybe going mini shopping *) 
had some delicious TOFU ! yummm . 
going out with my family ! finally getting some bonding going on . 
I am builing my portfolio . I need to have something to show the < PROPMALE > teacher before I enroll in < PROPMALE > classes for next semester . Wish me luck ! i love < PROPMALE > ! 
tried falling asleep early but as I said before , I am a night owl . I am most awake at night , very rarely during the day . listening to music and rocking out ! 8 ) 
had a gret time at church with my family today . I missed going with them . service made me laugh today cause the pastor gave a funny anecdote . so he's talking about fear and how when he barely came to the U.S. and the first time he got on a plane . he said that he was all scared on this plane ride and he saw this guy smoking a cig . 
so , his internal monologue was \ if this person who doesn't have God isn't afraid then why should I be ?! \ " my internal monologue when I heard this was like \ " that's so true * not so silent giggle *\" then he was all like \ " if I died I am was close to heaven anyways ! \ " then I laughed not so silently again 8 ) . " 
but then my morbid mind was like no , you would probably crash into the deep ocean and end up nowhere near the sky . man my head overthinks situations sometimes but nonetheless I thought today was a fun preach ... I was just about to write peach ! 8 ) . 
I cut my hair ! 
too much free time .... 
loving the rain ! It make me so Happy !!!!!! 
I love this weather ! It makes me smile for no apparent reason and I just have been feeling great all week ! thankyou God for making this week so special with things that are so simple . 
I got ditched today for a couple of babies ! BABIES !!! like wah .. boohoo , diaper babies ! 
dad : I hate my job\ 
son : I hate school

GIve praise to the Lord in times of hardship . 8 ) he's always there for us even though sometimes we think he isn't .

Such a GORGEOUS NIGHT LIKE THIS MAKES ME SO HAPPY AND HYPER !!!!! I WISH I COULD WALK ALL NIGHT !!!! 
eating a chile \serrano\ " . ummmm . goood . " 
I just crashed big time ! I am going to sleep . 
I am thankful I am home . I thank God for all the difficulties that occure because they only make me stronger . 
It's funny how it makes me cry to see an eagle soar , too see it's wings spread out , to see it effortlessly floating along with the wind , like a falling leaf suspended in midair . \ 
\ 
The gree of the grass radiating life unto the world , unto me . 
IT amazes me me so to think that even though there are billions upon billions of people in the world , there are stil places like this that make me feel , that make others feel like they are the only people on earth . 
Having barely taken a shower I feel renewed and being up here makes me feel so much at peace . I could literally be up here for hours , siting , contemplating , without a word uttered ; the silence speaks more than I ever can . 
Sometimes I wonder if I'm crazy because I don't talk very much , and when I do I feel like my way of thinking just doesn't mesh with the rest of the minds out there . Well , if I had people , in particular a person , who understands me I wouldn't mind being understood by anybody in the world . I'd much rather be sitting with someone and enjoying everyminute of our moment together , speaking to them through mutual thought . 
I went to a pumpkin patch and to a petting zoo today ! I had so much fun ! I was playing with a little black pig , a turkey , some chickens , and some goats . and I got to choose a pumpkin 8 ) .
