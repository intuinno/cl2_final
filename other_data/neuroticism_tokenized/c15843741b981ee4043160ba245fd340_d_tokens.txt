kinda starting to dig my new haircut :3 

Last night/this morning was great . Probably the best new year ever . I just wish that some more of my friends were there to celebrate with me . 
I've reinstalled WC3 and am thoroughly disappointed by the lack of people hosting good maps . There's like 1 DotA per < PROPFEMALE > of games ... wha ? 
Just caught the Pokéwalker pikachu that knows fly . Perfect way to end my week with an epic win . :D 
Sleep Sleep Sleep Sleep Sleep Sleep Sleep Sleep Sleep Sleep Sleep Sleep Sleep Sleep Sleep Sleep Sleep Sleep Sleep Sleep Sleep Sleep :D SLEEP 
I just checked 93 updates on my phone , guess what ? One person's updates were 38 of the 93 . Seriously ? I don't update that much in a month ! 
2 flying pikachu before bed ? SUCCESS . Waking up in 6 hours ? Not so much . TGIF 
Feels like I'm the only person that didn't get invited to senior party . Guess that happens when you aren't friends with any < PROPMALE > kids . 
Just woke up . 
Hey , anybody feel like going to prom with me ? 
Watching A Nightmare on Elm Street with < PROPFIRST > Adame . 
SOMEONE HELP . MY CAR DIED AND I'M STUCK IN THE ASS END OF NOWHERE . SERIOUSLY . 
I wonder if other schools have the same stupid scheduling as us or if it's just CCISD . 
Lazy Friday . Buc Parade , Taco < PROPFEMALE > and swimming at < PROPFIRST>'s Saturday . Beach & Subway today . Easily the best weekend I've had in a long time . 
Anyone awake that feels like talking ? Text me :D 
Rebeka Rioth - \Andrew Suh's back looks like an old african mans !! \ " < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > - \ " That's racial . \"" 
I may be burned and tired as hell , but today was a good day . I spent the day with some of the best friends I could ever hope to have . 
RAWR !!! I'm still sunburned lolz 
Anybody awake ? Keep me company . 
I can't be put to sleep since I have burn status , so I'm taking damage every turn and my attack is halved . ( only a few people will get this ) 
Pretty excited to dye my hair tomorrow with < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > :3 
I know D: 
Gettin ' mah hairs dyed ! 
Band banquet . Lookin ' pretty good . 
Who all is gonna wear their band senior shirt tomorrow ? 
Doing a barrel roll ! 
Anyone have Resident Evil 5 and want to play c o-o p ? 
Orchestra concert tonight at 6 . I'm going to be offended to the maximum if certain people don't show up . 
Oh man , I cried at the concert . I'm gonna miss high school orchestra so much . 
Sleepy 
Successful troll is successful :3 
Lolz < PROPMALE > orchestra concert 
@supersarahsays yeah they kinda kick our asses 
Oops lol I guess that's what happens when all of your services are linked XD 
Anyone still awake ? I can't sleep so I'm watching Scrubs . Someone talk to me D: 
Finals suck . 
Thank you < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > High . It's been great and I couldn't have asked for a better high school experience . I will miss you , but it's not goodbye , I will visit often . And to the MCHSSymphonicOrchestra members , last night was perfect . Thank you all so much 
Thanks , < PROPFIRST > . Do well in orchestra in my absence . Try your best and practice every day . 
I love < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > miller 
Just ate some amazing curry at Epcot's Japan area with one of my bestest friends . 
Curry for lunch 2 days in a row ? Good week . 
Finally back in town ? Feels good . Plus it's my birthday :D I love life . 
The Game . 
I am now a parakeet . 
Can't find a picture I like for my profile pic . 
EVERYONE !!! Check out the photos I just uploaded . < PROPFIRST > is going on a tagging spree . He's going to town all over all the pictures . 
It's been one week since you looked at me \ 
\ 
Cocked your head to the side and said \I'm angry\ " \ 
Guess who's got strep throat ? :D 
Why do people have to have conversations on my pictures and status updates . It gets really annoying when I look at my notifications and see 43 comments on one status . 
If it's healthier to leave you be , may a sickness come and set me free , kill me while I still believe that you were meant for me . Yellowcard is such a good band lol 
Just found out that facebook's chat has a :3 face . My life is now complete lol . 
Okay , what the hell , all of the people on my AIM < PROPMALE > list got deleted . It's just all blank . 
FREAKING WOW . My Neighbor Totoro reference in Toy Story 3 ? Good work Miyazaki . You have truly earned my respect . 
Hide and seek tomorrow . Meet at my house at 7 PM 
It's pretty pathetic when people have to go posting their problems all over facebook . Not to mention that the people who do this seem to do it at least as frequently as most other people make normal posts . Good thing we have the ability to hide things :D 
Hey everybody , today is Sonic the Hedgehog's 19th birthday !!! Happy birthday Sonic ! 
Eww lip piercings are kinda icky 
Still feeling kinda crappy . 
Had an awesome time with < PROPFEMALE > in < PROPMALE > , but now I'm on my way home :( anyone wanna do something fun when I get back ? 
Just watched the 2 episodes of Fullmetal Alchemist : Brotherhood right before the final one . Probably one of the best anime EVER . Can't wait to see the last episode . 
To barrel roll , press Z or R twice . 
So where is everybody today ? I'm pretty bored and only 3 people have texted me today . Maybe I just suck at life . Yep , that's gotta be it . 
Is it okay\ 
If I speak to you today\ 
You've been pissed off for a week now\ 
But nothing I could say\ 
Could make you look up\ 
Or crack up\ 
Is there anything that I can do\ 
Anything to show you ... \ 
I hope someone recognizes this , if not then maybe I just suck at life . Yep , that'd be it . 
Alright . So I don't exist ? 
Maybe I just suck at this game . 
I think it's stupid all the people who are moaning\ 
Yeah moaning on\ 
While the sun is shining down\ 
On our city streets\ 
Even all the things people say\ 
Naw , ain't affecting me\ 
Not when that damn sun \ 
Is shining down over me 
Ah , dammit . I just watched the final episode of Fullmetal Alchemist : Brotherhood . Every part of that anime is perfection . If you haven't watched it I highly recommend that you do , it's easily the best anime I've ever watched all the way through . Simply amazing . 
I was reading about the Kingdom Hearts series for the past couple of hours . I've decided I need a PSP so I can get KH Birth by Sleep . It has become a necessity . Anyone got one for sale ? 
Being on the computer all day has made me come to realize how much I really miss Mrs. < PROPFIRST>'s 6th period class . 
It seems like people really don't change . Trash will always be trash . 
Anyone feel like doing anything ? Life has been so boring lately . 
Why do my eyes burn so badly ? 
Hooray for hiding people ! :D 
Guess who I'm married to ! Be jealous world . 
Yeah ! 
Listening to the 2010 UIL band concert contest recording . To all the members of that symphonic band . I love you all . 
Goodnight FB world , if anyone wants to get at me they should send me a text . 
Pretty excited for my new pair of rollerblades to come in the mail . 
Had an awesome night <3 
lolz at < PROPFIRST > Barrera and < PROPFIRST > Garza 
When certain people open their mouth or decide to type up something stupid to post on face book they really get on my nerves . I don't think I get annoyed too easily , although I could be wrong , but man some people sure as hell need to learn to keep things to themselves instead of posting it online for everyone to see . 
Alright , everyone else has done it , so why not me too , right ?. Like my status and I'll tell you what I like/dislike first impression/confession about you and all that jazz . 
It sucks that even if I have someone hidden to avoid seeing their stupid posts , I still have to see when they post something stupid on my friends ' posts . 
Me : \I'm tired . \ " \ 
I'm scared to eat sweets anymore cause I don't want to end up with another fake ( at least mostly fake ) tooth . Plus I'm fat :( 
Goten was the best DBZ character , youngest super saiyan ftw . 
Just woke up , haven't been sleeping well lately . 
I have an Xbox360 at my house now , it's such a shame that Xbox ain't got gamez . 
10 years from now you see me married to___ . Working as a___ . With ___ kids . Living in ___ . Ok people fill in the blanks ! ( Copying < PROPFEMALE > out of boredom ) 
Poke me if you ever had a a crush on me . \ 
Like this status if you think I'm a good friend . \ 
Inbox me if you ever wanted a relationship with me . \ 
Comment on this status if we have had good memories . \ 
Now lets see who is brave enough to copy and paste this on their status :) 
Anyone wanna do anything ? Everybody has been being pretty lame lately . 
Pretty upset right now . Time to play some WoW and beat up on Alliance punks . 
It's funny . You'd figure that the people you consider your friends would want to see you and maybe < PROPFEMALE > out one last time before leaving for college , right ? I guess now I know how important I am to those people . Just goes to show who my REAL friends are . 
Beat horde wave 50 on Gears 2 . Pro status . Time to sleep . 
Lulz @ everyone being sad about leaving town or their friends leaving town . Stop being such babies . 
My fancy $350 dollar phone got run over by a car . Cool story , right bros ? 
Got a new phone . All is right with the world . 
College in 5 days . I swear it's not coming fast enough . 
Going to < PROPMALE > Mar to take my music test thingy to make sure I know how to music . So I haven't been doing this stuff since 5th grade ? 
Sometimes I just want to copy someone else's status , word for word , and see if they notice . 
:( 
I'm gonna start hiding those kids who go around liking all those stupid pages cause I'm tired of that being all I see in my news feed . 
Just hid 2 people because those 2 people together were over half of my news feed . 
Just hid someone else :3 
School tomorrow . So I'm not taking all music classes ? 
Yay college :3 
I'll change my last name to the last name of the first person who likes this status . Cool story , right bro ? 
Anyone want to < PROPFEMALE > out ? I'm just watching movies right now , so anybody is welcome to join me . 
So nobody wants to < PROPFEMALE > out today ? I guess that's what happens when all your best friends leave town for college . 
Okay so I just watched Rampage , the most literally insane movie I have ever seen . Now it's time to watch Dead Snow , which is apparently about nazi zombies . Win ! 
Yeah , it's raining , get over it . Literally just scrolled through about 20 updates about the rain , pretty annoying . 
Done with class until 12:30 . Time for a nap . 
I hate having these stupid gaps between my classes . 
Got my car back today , if anyone wants to do anything . 
Anyone wanna do anything before the weekend is over ? Text me . 
Hooray for liking stupid garbage that nobody cares about ! 
\Human beings 
Sometimes there’s no one left to tell me the truth\ 
It's gonna kill me the rest of my life\ 
Let me apologize while I'm still alive\ 
I know it's time to face\ 
All of my past mistakes\ 
I've got to live with them the rest of my life\ 
This is the mess I've made\ 
These are the words I can’t erase\ 
This is my life support\ 
Shutting down\ 
For the final time\ 
And it twists like a blade\ 
And kills me for the rest of my life 
Fell asleep . Woke up . Can't sleep now . 
Done with class till noon thirty . Sleep . 
There's a fine line between living a lie and feeling alive . 
Playing Halo Reach . If you wanna play my gamer tag is OctupleCactus . 
So I'm not special and never was ? 
Best anime ever ? Go ! 
Only one person has texted me today :'( 
This show is so good . It's a shame that I need sleep to live . 
What is it about zombies that makes me like them so much ? I don't even know . Maybe I'm just weird or something . 
You were the last good thing about this part of town 
I am unable to \like\ " things . Depressing . " 
If HOTD is really only 12 episodes long I'm gonna be so sad . That had better have just been the first season . 
Starting to regret majoring in music . 
Sometimes I wish that most of my joints weren't hypermobile :( 
So nobody wants to play Reach ? Sad day . 
Don't know what to write my cause/effect paper on . Any ideas ? 
Sit back and watch the train wreck , \ 
Watch me jump off the deep end . \ 
I won't lie , my mistakes take up every minute of my life . \ 
It's been the down fall of me , \ 
That misery just loves my company . \ 
And this voice is scared to say that i don't really mind . 
Mmm penises ... 
Hey everybody , \Don't forget 3 . Oct . 10 \"." 
Hey facebook . If I were a pokémon , which one would I be ? Or at least what type . 
I hate english more than I hate beating the elite four on pokémon and forgetting to take a pokemon that knows fly . 
Surprisingly not very tired . I'm gonna go rollerblade and see if I can tire myself out . 
Someone remind me again . When does fall start in CC ? 
Today started off looking like it was gonna be really crappy , but surprisingly it turned out to be a good day . 
< PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > Sturgeon ? 
The weather is nice out 
If you've ever watched Inuyasha , I recommend watching Inuyasha - The Final Act . The ending to the series was really great . 
The day has barely started , but it's already shitty . 
Today is going to suck , but when every day sucks what should I expect ? 
Okay . English just takes a shit on my whole day . No matter how well my day is going , English is there with it's pants down ready to ruin it . 
It was stupid of me to think that I could < PROPMALE > in music . 
< PROPMALE > Horror Picture Show Glee ? Yo dawg , I heard you watch shit , so we put some shit on your shit so you can watch shit while you watch shit 
Like this status if you agree that the weather today is beyond perfect . 
So who wants to < PROPFEMALE > out tonight ? 
Not celebrating Halloween again in Corpus . Also , I'm upset with < PROPFEMALE > Chapa and < PROPMALE > Valdez for not hanging out with me when they said they were going to . 
Mariachi concert at < PROPMALE > Mar tonight . If you love me , you'll be at the Wolfe Recital Hall by 7:30 .

Fucking magnets . How do they work ? 
Hey everyone . It are my sister's birfday .

The Walking Dead :3 
Someone needs to get < PROPFIRST > Super < PROPFEMALE > Ultra to help me complete the game . 
\You ain't straight unless you gay\ " - Timetry D . " 
Please put this in your status if you know someone or are related to someone who has been eaten by a dragon . Dragons are nearly unstoppable and , if you didn't know , can breathe fire . 93% of people won't copy and paste this because they have already been eaten by dragons . The other 7% of people are sitting in the shower armed with fire extinguishers . Please repost to help spread dragon awareness . 
Why can't I have nice things ? 
Man , I just drove by Wings ' n More with the windows down . Hungry now . 
Anyone wanna do anything ? I mean ANYONE and ANYTHING . No joke . 
Oh man . The things people call \music\ " these days . " 
To everyone who is still awake , go outside :D 
The Walking Dead time :D 
Nothing's gonna harm you . Not while I'm around 
Q&A anyone ? 
Q : What's one thing you've always wanted to tell me but never would/could ? \ 
A : I never could tell you that I wanted you to be my girlfriend . 
Q : Why didn't you ever give me the < PROPMALE > to love you ? \ 
A : I was in love with someone else , or at least thought I was . 
Q : What do you truly think of me ? \ 
A : I think you're a fun person to be around and that it's a shame that we never < PROPMALE > out and hardly talk now that I'm in college . 
Just wrote an English paper on Halo : Reach . Cool story , Spartan bro . 
This is not a status update .

I want to find a real religion . 
3 hours of sleep ? Bring it on , Monday . Do your worst . 
So my paper about Reach got a 98 . Today I wrote a paper on the poem < PROPFEMALE > . Cool story , Poe . 
I'm starting to wish that the friends I < PROPMALE > out with on a daily basis were in music theory with me , that way I would have someone to do the homework with :( 
Done with school for the day . What do ? 
Had too many awesome grass Pokémon cards so I ended up making 2 grass decks . Wat do nao ?

Trolling is a < PROPMALE > . 
The movie tonight with < PROPFIRST > , < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > , and only the aforementioned people , was amazing . I'm so glad that I have such good friends who enjoy my company even though we didn't all completely agree on a movie choice . 
Today was delicious !

35-You're not only one of the coolest bros ever , but you're also a /b/ro . Easily the best trunk dancer I know and always someone I can talk to whenever I want to nerd out about something . You're one of the only people who really shares my sense of humor and you're always the first to like or comment on my statuses . When I'm having a suckish day your comments always make me laugh . All around you're awesome . 
5 o'clock traffic is the werst . 
Done with school for the day if anyone wants to do anything . 
13-You're one of my most favorite people ever and the first girl I ever had feelings for , but I know you already know that . I always enjoy spending time with you and it makes me sad that we never get to see each other anymore . 
Deleted 5 people and hid 3 :D 
I has a brain esploding headache . 
Schmiarrhea ! 
Tonight was awesome . I love spending time with the brothers . 
So what happened to Daft Punk when the club got blown up on Tron ? 
There ain't no rest for the wicked . 
I hate it when people post shit about what they hate about other people's posts . 
Hey everybody ! I'm home :D 
It's days like this that make me wish I could live on my own . 
It's Knishmas < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Now I am become < PROPMALE > , the destroyer of worlds 
Some American bands should really take some tips from Japanese bands on how to be good at music lol

How many hipsters does it take to screw in a lightbulb ? ( < PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > aren't allowed to answer this one ) 
Anyone want to < PROPFEMALE > out ? 
I read the funniest status today . This stupid high school girl posted a status calling another girl a hypocrite when she did exactly what she accused the other girl of doing in that very post . Some people , huh ? 
I guess nobody wants to < PROPFEMALE > out today . 
Woke up ridiculously early . It's funny , cause some people haven't even gone to sleep yet lol . 
I love listening to the music on old cartoons , it always has great piccolo parts :3 
Someone come over to < PROPFEMALE > out ? 
Hello world . I am now awake . 
I guess the cancer is starting to affect Sparky's brain . He's losing his motor skills and it hurts him to move around . He can't differentiate between me and a threat so it looks like my dog will never willingly let me pet him again . 
God damn migraines . 
Arranging Outset Island from The Legend of Zelda : Windwaker with the aid of an official piano book for the game's music . 
Everybody go to the < PROPMALE > Mar honor band concert at 7:30 ! 
Everybody come over nao :3 
I really wish I had someone to help me arrange this stupid song . 
3DS release date and price have been announced . Gonna be the best handheld system ever . 
Does anyone have a copy of L4D or L4D2 that they're looking to get rid of ? 
Guess what I ate for lunch today :D 
I know it's not considered right , the way I live my days and nights . I always thought I'd rather be considered lucky than good . 
Updating my phone . If I mess up the update in any way , it could render my phone unusable , or just delete data like contacts or pictures . Either way , wish me luck . 
My turtle got out of his tank and was knocking on my front door for like 30 minutes . Just thought everyone needed to know . 
I like A Day to Remember more now that I realized they have an audio clip from The Boondock Saints at the beginning of Nineteen Fifty Eight . 
I should cut my hair like Sakon in my profile picture XD 
I can already tell that today is gonna suck . 
Motoi Sakuraba is my hero :D 
Poke me if you would like to be my < PROPFIRST > :D 
Okay , < PROPMALE > Mar needs a WoW guild already . So let's figure out what realm we're going to play on . 
Someone take me to TMEA . 
To the guy in the blue VW Beetle . You'd better watch your ass and sleep with your eyes open . 
Someone play WoW with me ! 
It's been a while since my fingers have hurt from practicing violin . I had forgotten how good it feels . 
Update on the violin practice . I have a blisters D: 
A large portion of my hair is now blond . Wat do ? 
Chillin ' at UTSA with < PROPFIRST > Adame
