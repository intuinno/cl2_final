< PROPFIRST > and I hosted a small get together last night with a couple of his co-workers , which was really fun . It lasted much later than we anticipated and now are a bit sleepy . Tonight we are planning to go see Iron Man II with PJ . 
Kevi and I just got back for a small date day , since it is my very rare day off . We went Fujiya's to eat and walked around the mall some . Kevi got a nice new black shirt , which he is very happy about . Tonight , I am sure we'll just relax , snuggle and watch a movie . 
Sadly enough , < PROPMALE > couldn't go to his cousin's graduation ceremony due to weather and < PROPFIRST > and I are working the entire weekend . 
I am getting promoted to a trainer at my second job soon and I am up for another evalution at subway , which means more money . Woot ! I know Kevi is starting up his summer classes in the beginning of June and he is trying to switch jobs to < PROPMALE > Millers or something that pays better than Palladium so he can work less and focus more on school . 
Kevi spent his day off spending time with his friends from work and we went out for dinner at Pho's once I got home with them . I don't like opening at 5 in the morning , so sleepy . I am glad < PROPFIRST > has people whom he can practice , train and work-out with since they share a common schedule . Today they went swimming , how lucky ! 
< PROPFEMALE > Burns Eliker CAN EVERYONE PLEASE STOP PLAYING THEIR GAMES FOR 2 MINUTES AND REPOST THIS ... PLEASE LIFT UP THE < PROPFIRST > LABLUE FAMILY . HE LOST 4 DAUGHTERS , AGES 2-11 IN A HOUSE FIRE LAST NIGHT . HIS 3 YEAR OLD SON AND WIFE WERE ABLE TO ESCAPE . SHE'S CURRENTLY IN ICU WITH BURNS . I DON'TKNOW THIS FAMILY , BUT I DO KNOW THAT ONLY GOD CAN HEAL ... THEIR LIVES NOW . PLEASE RE-POST THIS AND START A FB PRAYER CHAIN ! THANK YOU 
Going out tonight with some co-workers and < PROPFIRST > to celebrate my bosses 23rd birthday at the bowling ally . It was great today , when I brought her pink , purple and green cupcakes with pink icing and sprinkles , she didn't share ANY with anyone ! LOL . 
Well , what a strange week this will be . < PROPFIRST > is heading up to < PROPFIRST > for Monday and Tuesday and me , I'll be in < PROPFIRST > for the weekend selling stuff , meeting the top sellers in the country . Makes me nervous that my boss already has that much faith in me . O_o Best thing is though , I don't have to pay for my plane ticket , food and hotel ! And then A-con is the following weekend , so I'll be back up to < PROPFIRST > !! Lolz ! 
It seems my trip to < PROPFIRST > has been cancel due to my boss . >_> Pretty sure they fired her from the smart circle ... so I am at lost on what is going on . But the owner of smart circle is helping me somewhat . It actually is okay b/c I just got sick last night ! lol so I wouldn't have been able to work in the first place this weekend anyway . 
I find that no matter how terrible and confusing life is going , spending time with my family makes me feel better . 
Lots of work for me and < PROPFIRST > is enjoying his summer class . His friends are throwing a small pool party that we are attending after my work lets me out . We are trying to save up a bit of money so we can have a < PROPFEMALE > vacation together , so I am looking forward to that . 
I finally got my pet hedgehog and he is super cute !!! I needed something to fill the gap in my heart since I cannot have my cat without a super big pet deposit at my apartment ! 
Kumo , my hedgehog , has finally gotten used to < PROPFIRST > and I . \ 
His favorite activity : Running around with a toliet paper roll on his head like a periscope . 
Saw this and decided to do it ... Christina Gramm : Change\ 
your profile picture with one of a cartoon character of your childhood \ 
and invite your friends to do the same . The purpose is not to see a \ 
single human face on Facebook but an invasion of memories supporting the\ 
cause to FIGHT CHILD ABUSE 
Just spent today with my family for birthday and Christmas time , and as always it was a lot of fun !!!!!! 
Finished my potluck items for work ... now ... I have to go to work . * cries * ( I did post pics of it to b/c they are adorable ) 
Extreme overcast tonight . * pouts * Though the < PROPFEMALE > did slip through for a good ten seconds -_- 
Why does one only get sick on their days off ? * pouts * 
just made sushi ( with raw tuna ) for the first time and some sashimi ... it didn't look pretty , but was super delicious !!!! Also , turned one of the rolls I made into tempura style ( no longer raw : C ) , yummy !!!! I might post some pictures later if I didn't just kill our apartment , lol . 
It is strange to have a dream with a friend's mother whom recently past away , but it was sweet because she constantly said , \I love you\ " over and over again to him . "
