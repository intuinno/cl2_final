And the answer to the OTHER BURNING QUESTION is ..... I RODE THE SCOOTER TO WORK THIS MORNING ! It WAS chilly .. sorta .. just on the hands .. but me & < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > LOVED it ! :) 
Yo Peeps ... It's FINALLY Friday !!! REALLY cold for a scooter ride today ... But I have NO choice .. My Envoy STILL ain't done ! Geeezzz ... It BETTER be some blastin ass heat for as long as they've had it !?! :) 
OK ... HAPPY SUNDAY Ya'll ... Colts play at 4 .. STILL no Envoy so now I get to look forward to a REALLY cold scooter rider tomorrow morning I'm sure ! This is starting to get really frustrating .. we should've got this shit done when it was a little warmer outside ya think ? But when the old man gets to drive in luxury in HIS new truck .. he don't think about getting MY Envoy fixed ! NO FAIR ! :( 
Scooter ride .. YET AGAIN today !!! GGrrrrrr .. It's just too damn cold for this shit .. SUPPOSED to be getting the Envoy back TODAY .. but I ain't holding my breath ! :)
