I bought $1500 worth of games for $200 ... Best . Deal . Ever . 

If you Derp when you Herp . Do you Herp when you Derp ...? Sun Tzu said that . 
* Facedesk * so bored ... 
LASERS MAKE EVERYTHING BETTER ! IT NEEDS MOAR LASERS ! 
First day at Auburn started today , Pretty cool place . 
Classes I got are pretty ok ! :D 
I've noticed that I help others more than I help myself O.o 
I've also noticed that most of the people I help don't return the favor ... 
If a man wearing a taco suit send you to a field filled to the brim with cashews ... do ... not ... eat ... them ... 
BRAINS BRAINS I won't lie ! I'll eat their brains ' till they zombify . Sure , they may think that it's deranged , but they won't give it a thought after I've eaten their BRAIN 
I will never grow out of playing Pokemon games ... 
I dropped a marble ; when I chased after it , I dropped another . Only one remains in a single < PROPFEMALE > spot . The moment their hearts begin to beat , like it or not , people claim their own place . They keep protecting it so that it isn't snatched away . Though I kept my hands clean , they look dirty . Before I doubt my memory , my memory will doubt me . 
Weekends go by way too fast ... 
When I pass by a full , quiet classroom while walking down the hall . I am overcome with the urge to say something completely random , like \Potato \"." 
Been watching way too much Bleach lately , but after I start I can't stop watching ! 
I like cheese ! 
Starting to form a rut . I hate ruts , and if you know me , there's only one thing that comes after from being in a rut ... Melancholy 
Melancholy hit sooner than I thought . 5:40 AM to be precise , when I realized I had to get ready for school . 
Hrmm , I feel satified today . 
So much work coming in from school . I really don't want to do any of it ... 
I'm having an off week . 
Awesome weekend is awesome . 
Resubscribed to Final Fantasy 11 , I can't stay away any longer lol . 
That gaming session ... had to be the most fun I've had in ... a very freaking long time . 
My drill shall be the drill that will pierce the heavens ! < PROPFIRST > my words ! This drill will open a hole in the universe ! And that \ 
hole will be a path for those behind us ! The dreams of those who've \ 
fallen ! The hopes of those who'll follow ! Those two sets of dreams weave\ 
together into a double helix ! Drilling a path towards tomorrow ! My drill is the drill ... THAT CREATES THE HEAVENS !!! 
So very tired ... 
Got the stomach flu ... I'm puking up my stomach contents every few hours ... sounds like fun , doesn't it ? 
bwhaahahahah ! 
Got my license today ! :D 
The consuming cold embrace that is winter is nearly here , I love it . 
DYNAMITE ! 
That physics test was completely stupid ... 
Damn you anxiety ... 
< PROPFIRST > NIXON ! 
Almost time for my bi-weekly ritual of : Being a Pro Gamer , drinking pure energy , becoming slap happy , making nonsensical slap happy statements , having a massive crash at 8 AM , getting up a couple hours later , and recovering for the next 2 days ... 
Glad to finally be on break ! 
Oh joy , it seems to be a trend ... Why , What's Up ? 
If you ever step on my patch ... 
I suck at Little Big Planet !!! 
Happy Thanksgiving ...! 
Unfortunately for me , my appetite has gone down the drain the past month . So all I could eat was a measly 1 fully packed plate of food ... x.x 
You can't protect the web from a -- holes like me ! >:D 
I got a measly 2 hugs on \Hug a Gamer Day\ " ... :( " 
* sigh * Life just seems to punch me right in the face no matter which path I choose . >.> 
I'm wearing a < PROPFEMALE > hat now ! 
I love teh snow ! 
One more day this week , then it's time to do our bi-weekly ritual again ! 
Note : Pilon is known to randomly hug people at any time , do not resist , only embrace the hugs ! :D 
I love the snow , but the snow seems to hate me ... 
Send me a # in my inbox 1 ~ 500 and I will tell you what I think of you in my status .... without anyone knowing who you are . 
#16 Oh joy , oh joy . Where to start with this one ? I think you're very headstrong and straight forward . I like that in you , to be honest . Although , sometimes you use force when force isn't necessarily needed ... I enjoy your company as well as your input , and I think you have a very likable personality . I'll give you a hug next time I see you ! :D 
#423 * sigh * let's get on with this one , shall we ? Your intelligence is your greatest asset , and although you may be an asshole a lot of the time , you're still my friend . I remember we met in 5th grade , Mrs. Sivula's class you < PROPMALE > out with me and Cooper when you first came to < PROPFEMALE > , but we didn't really become friends until 7th grade , when I decided to invite you to my party that year ... \Farty Party\ " remember ? " 
#3 . 141592654 You would pick this number ... What to say ? You've gotten my back and I've gotten your back since 5th grade . You take pride in who you are which I respect in the highest sense . Your ability to command can be quite frightening at times , it seems like you can manipulate them as if they were your own arms and legs . 
#333 Plant yourself on the point there mister , I remember I met you at < PROPFIRST>'s < PROPFEMALE > party my freshman year . We were all playing spore and such . I've come to know you more and more throughout the years and our visits to Otakon . I enjoy your ability to talk to me on level with all things technical , as well as showing me cool new things and anime . 
#27 Where to start ? I enjoy seeing you , talking to you , and waging this little war that we've been having for the past months . You're a great artist and actually had the guts to stand up to my rule >.> You seem to make my day a lot and , from what I see , we have quite a bit in common . :P let's talk some more sometime , and I'll give you another hug tomorrow , bwahahaha ! >:D 
#55 This one's going to be fun . I remember we met on the bus going to school one day . Mr. Dilley had forced you to sit in the same seat as me . I was not happy at this . But , slowly , we became friends and you have been one of my better friends . You are indeed intelligent , but you're also lazy , to a point where it really annoys me at times because you could be so much more than you are right now , 
#2 . 3 repeating . You are very fragile and a natural empath , you share in others feelings quite well I've noticed . Even so , you take a while to get over things , and you make some things a big deal when I can't see why you are making them such . You're a very nice girl though , and people seem to care about you quite a bit . You make friends easily which is more than I can say for myself . :P 
#187 So much to say about you ! You have the biggest collection of anime type things I have ever seen in my life , I can say that I am truely envious of your room and collection . o.o You love company and hugs , about as much as I do . You hate being ridiculed and treated as being lesser or inferior ... like me .... and you also dislike being ignored ... also like me ... 
#222 Well , you seem to be the very hyper but very emotional type . Your emotions change on a whim and you seem to effect alot of the people around you . You're very fickle and like attention quite a bit . You hold yourself in high regard which means you respect yourself which is what I like in you . I think you're a cool girl , although I think you talk to loud at times , especially in the morning . >.< 
#21 I met you my freshman year , in one of Cueni's classes . You're very good with computers , definitely good with HTML . You seem to stress easy and get migrains quite often . You often tell the rest of us to keep it down , but were just as loud as we were moments before . You voice your opinions and you are very open about every aspect of yourself 
#137 Ah , how could I forget the first friend I made in highschool . I remember you were picking on poor < PROPFIRST > for something the first day of school . Me being the protective person I was stood up to you without knowing what was going on . You used to sit at our lunch table talking about your escapades in WoW and such . You are a very intelligent guy with good amount of character . 
I've been tons happier lately ! 
People are confusing me so much right now ... q.q 
NOT AGAIN ! 
My Dwarves keep killing themselves in the most elaborate ways ... 
I have a feeling of impending doom today ... wonderful ... 
Eh , why not ... INBOX ONLY : 2010 is almost over . Confess something you have always wanted to tell me or ask me . [ 100% private ] put this as your status 
I had a very very very very very very very very good night ! :D 
Well , gaming turned out to be a total fuster cluck ... I really could have turned out better . It got better near the end , and we still were our goofy selves , but geeze , there was a lot of heavy air and stuff going around ... 
I've been talking on the phone for 3 hours now ... XD 
6 hours and some minutes was when we decided to stop and go to bed ... I don't think our cellphone plans will allow us to do that again though ... 
Awesome day ! :D 
Just a note . If I log in at 1 AM on a Wednesday , I am not really online ... That's my computer waking up automatically for maintenance . It just happens to log me back into all my chats because of Digsby ... 
It's Christmas < PROPFEMALE > ! 
New Laptop = Win .

Gah , FML ! It just figures my body decides to react to something violently right before school ... Which I actually want to go to ! * sigh * To the doctors today ... hooray ! >.> 
I keep pocket dialing people ... If I call you and don't answer to anything you say , I have most likely called you by accident >.> 
Well ... that tech club meeting was ... interesting ... At least I got to spend an hour with Snowy ! :D <3 
Thank you for all the birthday wishes everyone ! I had a great birthday ! :D 
Wushu style of gaming = epic ... 
I know I'm not the only one who has said this , but the spelling in this country is atrocious ! Not only that , but people seem to continue misspelling words , even when spell check is implemented in Facebook ! o.o
