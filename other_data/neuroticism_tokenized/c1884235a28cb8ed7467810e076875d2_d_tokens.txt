Anybody else have a project they had to do over winter break and procrastinated ? 
You know , thinking back on my actions of when I'm with my friends , I've made a sad discovery : I'm the kind of person I would not < PROPFEMALE > out with . 
I am staying home tomorrow ! No school for meh ! >:D Sucks to be everyone else . Including < PROPFIRST > . 
Life may give you lemons but without sugar and water , your lemonade's gonna suck . 
Motto of the Day : Want the best for you friend , even if it's not the best for you . 
This is getting really difficult . High school hurts and sucks . Too many projects with which I have no money to spend for them . Too many hurt friends whom I can't comfort because I can't relate . Too many people living too far away . Too much time and yet not enough to do anything purposeful . What is my purpose right now ? How can I help ? What kind of person can't even save a dear friend ? Apparently ... me . 
Hmmm ... stress-induced depression ? I suppose that's what I have .... \ 
\ 
Mood : contemplative : I 
Sometimes I wonder what the world would be like ... nevermind . It doesn't matter . 
The family's out to watch Iron Man 2 . I stayed home cuz I didn't want to pay ... bored bored and more bored . Guess I'm not doing anything today ... * sigh * None of my friends ever want to < PROPFEMALE > out . TT3TT 
Ho hum , pig's bum . I is boredish . Doodle < PROPFIRST > doo . Who can tell ? :P 
\You are about to poke < PROPFIRST > McIntosh . It will be shown on her home < PROPFEMALE > . Poke < PROPFIRST >?\" * Poke * \ " You have poked < PROPFIRST >.\"" 
You know something bad is up when your mother gets all ' loving ' and ' touchy-feely ' . Be suspicious . Be VERY suspicious . >_>' <_<' 
* since apparently everyone is doing it and I thought , ' Why the hell not ? ' * Like this and I'll tell you what I like about you ! <3 
I hate that feeling when you wanna eat something but not for the fullfillingness of it , but just for the taste . 
It's funny how fast fat people can run when they're running for their lives . :) 
Took an advanced personality test and was slightly surprised by the results ... 
Finished my ( really crapily done ) independant reading project . Can't wait to see the movie < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , and I made ! Need to work on the story board thing ... 
Dear Hollywood , \ 
STOP . MESSING . UP . MY . FAVORITE . BOOKS !!! 
Okay it's official , Passion is REALLY fucking hard to play for the flute . Also I can't fucking find some free sheet music for < PROPFEMALE>'s Theme ! DX 
* rewritten because the momz wanted it censored ... * Okay it's official , Passion is REALLY ducking hard to play for the flute . Also I can't ducking find some free sheet music for < PROPFEMALE>'s Theme ! DX 
I am apparently having a poking war with < PROPFIRST > via facebook . WHO WANTS TO JOIN ?! >:D CHOOSE YOUR SIDE ! * I call the dark side ! We have cookies AND Hibari ! * 
This is completely terrible ! I'm reverting back to my eighth grade ways ! DX\ 
Oh and at school today the : Fire alarm was set off after school ( EVERYBODY cheered ) , there was a water balloon fight , silly string was everwhere , and air horns were going off . All in all , awesome . Oh yeah , and I were my yellow spongebob pj pants that < PROPFEMALE > & < PROPFIRST > got me for my b-day . 
Hobknocker : ( n ) Someone who slaps someone else with their ... p **** <- censored so I won't get grounded . \ 
Gotta love iCarly ! 
Fullmetal Alchemist is over ! NOOOOO !! TTOTT * sob sob * 
You know , I wish someone would surprise me with a phone call to talk instead of the other way around , except nobody ever answers . Sometimes I feel really left out ... :( 
XDDD I found a FFVII version of the OHSHC opening and it's actually really good ! :D 
This is gonna sound crazy and ( for < PROPMALE > ) offensive , but as I listened to a random < PROPFIRST > beiber song I heard on the radio , my first thought was ' Huh , reminds me of < PROPMALE > singing . ' O.o 
I wanna < PROPFEMALE > out with my friends . Or at least talk to them . Call me , anyone ? 
Come on people ! They're called Skinny Pants , not Make-You-Skinny Pants ! Ugh ! Gross . 
I ish bored . Who wants to < PROPFEMALE > out during the week ? I'm free , bored , and wanna party . ;P 
Is SOOOOOO bored ! Somebody talk to meh ! 
Found this really cute outfit , but couldn't buy it . Maybe next week . :( 
Hm .... Had a good dinner . For some reason my finger itches like crazy and there's a purple-ish < PROPFEMALE > there now . O.o Strange ... 
Guh ... summer sucks so far . Haven't seen any of my friends . Chatted with < PROPMALE > last night ( a miracle in itself ! :D ) and ........ did chores today . :/ 
A friend is not a friend if you can't trust them . \ 
Family is not family if you do not love them . \ 
Both are people you do not need if they don't listen to your problems . Why do you have to help them , when they can't even bother to help you ? 
You know what I miss ? The innocent elementary school days where you could < PROPFEMALE > out with guys and girls without impressing them . The only problems back then were uniforms , teachers , homework , and who gets the ball to play kickball/four square . Life was so simple . Back then everyone wants to grow up , but what's the point . I hate high school . :( 
Everyone's bored and yet nobody wants to do anything . I hate when people break promises . :( 
Don't touch me unless you plan to talk to me . Don't promise me things and then decide not to go through with them . Don't hurt me so much and then expect me to come back . \ 
... * sigh * Don't expect me to come back , but I'll do so anyway because I need you in my life , even if you don't want me in yours . 
Ugh I'm thinking of giving up on that friendship . It's too difficult trying to keep it alive when the other person isn't really even trying . It's like trying to dump the water back out of a sinking raft . I wanna give up . :( 
Emag eht tsol tsuj uoy . \ 
Congratulations if you succeeded in reading that . :) 
m off groundation ! :D 
God I really want a hairstyle change and my hair shorter . And a new outfit . I feel so ... uncool . lolz , I sound so narcissistic . 
I'm the kind of girl that can be so hurt but still look at you and smile . The kind of girl who will try to brighten your day when she can't even brighten her own . 
Boredy boredy . I want something to dooo ~ ~ ! 
It's official : I absolutely love Mukuro ! <3 <3 \ 
And Chrome too , but not in the same way . 
Devart : \So-and-so has given you a llama badge . Congradulations ! You have accumulated 10 llama badges . Your llama has been upgraded to a super llama ! \ " \ 
It's official : I am getting much better at drawing ! :D Pics later , I hope . 
Completely bored . I try calling people and nobody answers . Wtf's up with summer if nobody wants to < PROPFEMALE > out ? Eating cookies ... ugh . \ 
Oh , and .... Yougamejustlostthe . 
Sometimes I wonder what I would wish for if I aquired a < PROPFEMALE > . \ 
1 . World peace ? \ 
2 . No debt for everyone ? \ 
3 . Me : * thinks * Wait ... Is it a hot male < PROPFEMALE > ? If not then ... Can I have more wishes ? \ 
Genie : Nope . \ 
Me : Dang . Um .... Uh-oh . I'm in trouble . 
Be leaving sooner or later . Boredy bored bored once again . Hmmm .... uh .... What else to say ? Um .... Coral eat each other . 
Party was fun last night . I'm exhausted . I love you , < PROPFEMALE > , but you're just TOO fun to scare ! XDD 
* sigh * Got both paper mache glue AND glue in my hair . T T__T T The Momz is threatening to not give me ice cream cake . The Momz is going Outback tonight . Happy Birthday , Mother ! :D Oh and You Just- 
I ish bored . Want ice cream . I discovered I only have 5 ' real ' friends . :( Pathetic . 
Jesse : Why do you listen to japanese music if you can't understand what it's saying ? \ 
Me : * thinks , Oh Shiz ! * Well , people listen to screamo and rap but they can't understand that . Why can't I listen to japanese music ? \ 
Jesse : * ponders this for a moment and then turns to leave * Good point . \ 
Me : XD 
At my dad's now . T T__T T * sniffle * I had to delete all the songs on my iPod because my step-dad deleted iTunes on the comp and I had to move it to another comp . * sob sob * 
My foot still ducking hurts from when I dropped a drawer on it !!! T T__T T It hurts ~~~ 
Had ramen with chopsticks earlier ... I'm completely BORED . Kinda depressed , actually . 
Ever had those days where you want to do something , but you really just DON'T feel like it ? Yeah , same here . 
Mother : n . Female 1 . Who cares for family . 2 . Smartest in the household . 3 . Catchphrase : \You better effing listen to me or else I'm gonna play god and send you straight to hell ! \ " 4 . A being you must fear " 
I'm tired of so many things lately . My friends , my family , my life . Sometimes I really wish I could melt into the imaginary world I've created for myself and just cut the bonds I have to everyone and everything . 
People , in my most likely hypocritical opinion , don't seem to realize how much their opinions hurt others . 
Well a car flipped over , like , right outside our house . Never a dull moment around here . Gas station robberies , bears mysteriously appearing in our trees , and cars flipping over . Aah , that's the life . :) 
Well the momz is pissed , < PROPFIRST > once again proves he's hopeless , I'm banned from all kinds of crap , and all my ' friends ' aren't acting like friends . Just another day in the * life * of < PROPFIRST > . 
My heart aches . Just leave me alone . 
... 
I officially have no glasses and I can hardly see . T T__T T 
Damn you , OHSHC Chapter !! How DARE you not be out ?!? ~ 
Just got back from swimming in a river with my dad and his girlfriend . May have pics later . < PROPFIRST > wasn't there ! :D All in all , a good day . :) Except that now I'm sunburnt . 
Honestly , some of you people , I REALLY hate you . >:( 
I'm miserable . 
Think of the worst day of your life so far . Today's mine . 
Just woke up . My eyes are swollen from crying so much , I feel like crap , and my sunburn ... burns . 
It's gone from me wanting to leave , to my mom kicking me out . Y_Y 
My writer's block is OVER !! Now to type my story ! :D 
Guess I'm not going to work tomorrow cuz I don't have a ride . Fine with me . I can work on my story then . I need ideas , though ! TTATT 
too much stress going on with everyone ... :( 
Reading D . Gray Man . :D 
Don't think that you know me so well . 
Last day of Kids College . Wish me luck ! :D 
Still reading D . Gray-man . I thought that the series was over , but maybe it's not ? :/ 
I've caught up on D . Gray Man . Seriously , I HATE when the chapters are so ... cliffhangery ! TTATT 
Ugh , I lost the game . 
\Ah 
Ugh , I have pictures I wanna put up but I don't have a camera at the current time ! TTATT 
OH MY GOD !! I am FREAKING OUT !! < PROPFEMALE > was right ! They ARE making a parody of the Twilight films ! XDDDDD It's called Vampires Suck !! I am SO going to see that ! :D Whenever I get money , we have to have a group movie date !! 
... I can't find Naruto on any of the manga sites anymore . Someone tell me if they find one where I can read it . It's strange ... Onemanga goes down and suddenly Naruto does too ? 
God , I could really go for some Flippers and mint chocolate chip ice cream right now ... 
Just because I was bored I looked at the videos where shoop da whoop supposedly originated . Seriously , some of the parts were stupidly hilarious . My side hurts * doesn't know if that's related to the laughter or not * 
\I just wanna fall and lose myself/ I'm laughing so hard/ It hurts like hell/ Forget about everything ... \"" 
MEN : Proof that God has a sense of humor . 
I've gotta learn how to draw the disney princesses so that I might earn some money . :D I absolutely HATE drawing their faces ! I can't do their eyes or mouths ! D: 
Okay , I took care of the princesses , but now I've got nothing to do ... 
Oh my freaking god , what happened in the new D . Gray Man chapter . :D This is so great ! 
Temari : Kankuro , Gaara's in one of those ' moods ' again . \ 
Kankuro : Oh god , oh god . What to do . I've got to escape . But this is GAARA we're talking about here . I'm so-\ 
( evil ) Gaara : There you are , Kankuro . I've been searching for you . \ 
Kankuro : Please G-Gaara . Have mercy . \ 
Gaara : * sitting at a table with his < PROPMALE > bear in the chair next to him * Shut up and put on a damn apron . Mr. Sprinkles wants his tea , NOW ! 
Officially fell back in love with Sasuke ( I'm such a nerd ;D ) . It's nice to know that in the english version of Naruto Shippuden Sasuke hasn't gone through 5 different puberties like Konohamaru did . ( seriously . ) 
Hmmm ... Just cuz i wanna know ... \Your first impression of me was _____when you first met me \"" 
I really hope I have at least one class with one of my friends this year . :/ I wanna go to < PROPFEMALE > and sams and/or < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE>'s house before summers over , but nobody will answer their damn phone . D: and omfg , I've got five classes as of right now . Wtf am I going to do ? 
Saw < PROPMALE > at school . Turns out that I really DO have five classes . I have my first class every other day . English 2 honors on monday first and then AP World History ( UGH ) on tuesday and so on , I suppose . 2nd- agriculture ( though I wanted vet assisting :P ) 3rd- Physical Science 4th- Zoology ( but shouldn't I have zoology and not physical science ? ) 
Hmmmm ... Last weekend of summer . Kind of can't wait for school . I can't wait to see all my friends ! EXPECT TO BE GLOMPED !! :D And for you SL kids .... well you can randomly fall down and then claim that ' < PROPFIRST > just ghost glomped me . ' XD Tell me if you actually do that ! \ 
In random news , I'm suppose to go to my dad's this weekend .... 
< PROPFEMALE>'s pissed about me not going over and now she's blowing up my notifications . D8 
Dyed my hair black ! <3 I wanted to get it styled too , but my parent don't have the money and neither do I . * pout * Oh well . I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE EVERYONE !!! Oh , and I reeeeeallly wanna play KH4 whenever it comes out . :D < PROPFIRST>'s got me excited and hoping !! 
Well looks like summer has left us at last . :( So many things unfullfilled that I wanted to finish before summer ended . Damn laziness . At least I get to actually DO stuff now . Summer has always been boring to me . I can't wait until fall/winter ! I hate the heat . :D 
Made my ramen too soggy this morning . :/ Working on my story and I read the newest OHSHC chapter ! :D Tamaki is so awesome retarded ! XD 
Ugh I got The Count of < PROPMALE > Christo to read but it's 1500 pages or so and I gotta finish by .... Wednesday I think . :P And I still need to find some books for AP History to read as well . Damnit , school's hit me hard and knocked everything but the heat of summer out of me . D:< 
Got too much shiz to do . Going swimming tommorow ! :D I really wanna < PROPFEMALE > out with my SL friends .... Maddie and < PROPFIRST > , keep next weekend's schedule open ! 
sunburnt and hanging out in the shade because of it . texting < PROPFEMALE > and wishing she , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , and < PROPFEMALE > were here . :( 
God I lay down at 7 , think about life , open my eyes and suddenly it's 12:30 am . Wtf . My stomach and back are really sunburnt , but I'm not bad as my brother < PROPFIRST > ! He has it EVERYWHERE !! D: It sucks 2B him . 
It's difficult trying to explain to some of my newer friends that when I slap them or if I pretend to sound offended , I'm just joking around and cuz I only slap friends that I love . 
Just watched OHSHC episode 13 . I felt like I was high the whole time . That < PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland parody was completely different than the manga , but I still loved it ! XD 
Ugh , I think I'm getting sick . I feel terrible . Bleh . 
Still sickish . Ugh . 
I hate taking pictures with < PROPFIRST>'s DSi , but it's the only way I can put my pictures on because my mom refuses to let me use her camera thingie . 
Almost done with the minis picture ! I like it ! :D 
Wanna go over to the twins ' house but I may be going tomorrow . I hope so ! 
Grr .. I REALLY wanna < PROPFEMALE > out with people today ! Anybody ? < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > , if you want me to come over , you'll probably have to pick me up because mother is being .... mother . 
I was looking for a job earlier , but I've decided that I'm going to wait for a few more months and try again when I'm 16 . Oh well . :( 
Mom officially wishes I wasn't born . Happy day :P At The TWINS ' house . Wearing a dress . Reading this , I can't help but wonder what went wrong in my life . :) Please , do share . Oh , and < PROPMALE > ? Prepare for skirt torture ! >:} D 
Checked my email account for the first time in god knows how long . Had 438 messages . I'm in love with my dad's new kitten , < PROPFIRST > . <3 <3 
Well shit , we've lost < PROPFIRST > somewhere in the house . Damnit . < PROPFEMALE > -our other , older , cat- seems to be ecstatic . She's cuddling with my dad as I type this . 
I see how it is . >:/ 
Life is like a potato . I don't know why , it just is . :) 
Getting paid $5 for a simple < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > picture that I < PROPFIRST > ! :D Super excited ! 
Well if it's not real , you can't hold it in your hands , can't feel it with your heart .... then I won't believe it . But if it's true you can see it with your eyes , oh , even in the dark , then that's where I want to be ! 
I like the ones who say they listen to the punk rock ;\ 
I like the kids who fight against how they were brought up ;\ 
They hate the trends and think it's fucked to care ; It's cool when they piss people off with what they wear , oh yeah 
Failed multiple times yesterday . A fail in itself . :/ Don't know what to do . Kinda wanna talk to someone on the phone .... 
Finished my ducking carpet finally ! :DDDDDD Feeling accomplished ! It's soft . X3 Made an adorable panda picture . Read the final OHSHC chapter ! First shojo manga ending I liked . :D Good day . 
What is this tight feeling I get in my chest and stomanch when I think of you ? It was never there before ... 
I hate history homework . >:/ 
Gizmo's paw is hurt . :( I don't know what's wrong , maybe a cut between his toes ... Reading Chobits like < PROPFEMALE > wanted me to . Wanting tacos ... 
Devin : * accidently stabs self with pencil and starts bleeding * OW ! \ 
Me : * ish laughing her ass off*\ 
Devin : It's not funny ! Why are you laughing ?! \ 
Me : I just remembered what happened at my friend's party earlier this year . :) \ 
Devin : ... \ 
Me : Oh , hey , you're bleeding . Wtf ? 
Going to < PROPFIRST>'s parteh ! XDDDDD I'm excited !! Still need to get a card though , but no present . :( Oh wellz . It'll be a good card . :) 
is sucking on something . Take a guess . ;D 
I realized , in a really delayed manner , that we have to wake up before the sun . Son of a bitch . :( 
Grrr ... I can't put Caramell Dansin on my iPod . :( 
Starting my AP History homework . :P Sucketh . 
So much for the friends who weren't there to comfort me in my time of need . :/ 
Dun dun . Dun dun . Dun dun . Salsa shark . We're gonna need a bigger boat . Man goes in cage , cage goes in water . Shark's in the water . Our shark . Salsa shark . 
I never realized how lonely I am until I see my friends talking together and realize I'm more distant from them then I originally thought and that our friendship will never reach one where trust isn't an issue . Maybe trust is the problem with me ... :/ 
I don't feel any shame , I won't apologize where there ain't nowhere you can go ... Running away from pain when you've been victimized . Tales from another broken home . 
Well , I'm still at < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST>'s house because I spent the night . It's both < PROPFEMALE > and Naruto's birthday ! XD Happy Birthday !! 
\Name an animal that humans walk like . \ " \ " Uh ... Uh ... Dolphin ! \ " Me : What . The . FUCK ?!?! 8O " 
I have a new Gaia now if any of my friends wanna friend me . It's Tsuki The Wolf . :D \ 
... Planet Unicorn !!! XDDD 
is wondering who all she wants to invite to her birthday party ( if she has one ) and what we should do considering her house is boring as heaven . ( I would say hell , but peace and fulfillment is boring , not that I don't want it . ) 
Sanji : \Ship\ " \ " Run\ " \ " Marines . \ " \ " There . \ " \ 
I don't know what's going on , but I'm hoping to go to Typhoon Lagoon this weekend , but it might not happen so .... :P 
Great , < PROPFIRST>'s developed < PROPFIRST>'s ' Let's ask < PROPFIRST > completely pointless questions when she OBVIOUSLY doesn't want to talk ' shiz . * slams head against keyboard and scowls * 
Stayed the night at < PROPFEMALE>'s house last night and we went to Typhoon Lagoon today ! We're both exhausted . My feet hurt . There were , like , 20 giants waves in , like , 1 hour ! It was awesome . :3 I got chocolate dip n ' dots and lots o ' candeh ! Good day :D \ 
Oh ... and KAMIKAZE WATERMELON !! * behdehbedoopbedoo ! * Whee ! ( 20 points to the person who gets the joke ! ) 
Guh . None of my SL friends ( not counting < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > , though I still love them ! ) will talk to me . :( Boo you guys . 
Watching NTAS again ! :D Kisame : Itachi , can I cut them ? Nyah Nyah Nyah Nyah . \ 
Itachi : No ... but I'll tell you what you can do . Break the street with your sword to show them how heavy it is . \ 
Kisame : * whips out sword and slams onto street , causing huge crack . *\ 
Itachi : Excellent . XDDD 
Is currently at the library . Couldn't put my songs on my damn iPod cuz my dad's comp . is broke ! DX Going to < PROPFEMALE>'s tonight and we'll trick-o-treat tomorrow with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > ! ( If she comes . :) ) 
Is feeling really moody ... Current mood : Lonely . Next Mood Swing in .... 
If you really knew me , you would know just at a glance how I felt at that moment . You'd be able to see the signs that I unconciously show to call out for help with and you'd read them like a book . 
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck . 
My birthday's in four days . :) Count down Initiated ! 
Just did Caramell Dansin for the first time since ... I can't remember when in my Naruto shirt , light blue pajama shorts and rainbow fuzzy socks . I feel accompished . :D 
It's funny how when I took five different Naruto personality tests ( I was bored ) I got 2/5 Naruto , 2/5 Sasuke , and 1/5 Kakashi . I think that sums me up quite nicely . :) 
Phineus and Ferb , Y U no go back to school yet ? 
Shit shit shit is there anyone on facebook right now who has Mr. Ferrell and can tell me what the CCOT essay topics were ?! D: I lost mine ! I'm so screwed ! Q_Q 
Found the paper . I am now studying Gender Systems in Islamic Religion from 600 A.C.E. to 1400 A.C.E. Ew . But it's necessary for the Change and Continuities Over Time essay tomorrow . D: AP History students would sympathize . Or will soon . 
My birthday's tomorrow ! 16 years !!! :D 
Thank you everyone for the birthday wishes ! I love you all ! I can't wait until this weekend in which the people I invited should and WILL be coming over ! :D 
Well < PROPFIRST > was making homemade butter in a can and he was shaking it , okay ? Apparently he wasn't holding the lid down enough and ..... well let's just say if we added a lot of red foor dye to it , it would look like a murder scene . The momz pissed and me , well , I WOULD help but 1 . It's my birthday and 2 . I'm too busy laughing my ass off . It was everywhere . XD 
Hmmm got all the supplies for the party except the damn popsicle molds . Why the HELL is it when you ducking need something , you NEVER find it even though you've spotted it milliions of times ?! Ugh ! DX Oh , and I got Manga Pens ! :D Happy day ! 
Party ( thingie ) tomorrow . I can't wait , but honestly I'm really nervous because I don't know who all is coming . I didn't go to school today ( My room was such a mess , I needed a whole day to clean it ) so I don't know about < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > . < PROPMALE > is ... \Um ? \ " and < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > better come or I'll castrate them ( and they know I would ) . And Courtney ... I haven't even gotten a hold of her . D: " 
Holy crap . I just watched one of those ' spy toys ' commercials . Lie detector ... night vision glasses ... wristwatch camera ... They're ENCOURAGING kids to become stalkers . 
Okay , well the party is officially over now that < PROPFEMALE>'s gone home . I feel a good kind of tired . The party was fun . I can't wait to see < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , and especially < PROPMALE > ( cuz , I never get to see him , but I visit < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > fairly often ) again . :3 Note to stupid kids out there , Don't call any of my friends idiots or you WILL be pushed down a < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > while we watch your blood escape your skull , m'kay ? ^_^ 
Working on my WHAP B-assignment . And failing in paying attention ! Facebook's up , you see , and my friends are on . :D 
Finished 3/10 cities . I fail . My attention span is officially GONE . Night , history , I'm done with you . 
It sucks to realize that the more and more you get tired , the more your mind realizes awful truths that you've avoided for the day . :( 
Just watched the new Naruto Shippuden opening . It's strange .... but I kinda like it . There were two extremely gay moments in there including Sasuke and Sai . And Naruto's , like , shirtless the whole time . :3 
My brother informed me that there's actually a rhyme for orange now . I have a strong feeling that the guys who make the dictionary were like , \Let's just make a fucking rhyme for orange ! D:< \"" 
I can't find anything on the car crash that killed those kids . :( 
How I wish that thing with that weird kid went down :\ 
Kid : Why did you tickle my foot ? \ 
Zack : Uh ... It was her . * points to me*\ 
Kid : * to me * Why'd you tickle my foot ? \ 
Me : Because I'm a pedofile . \ 
That's what I would've totally done . 
I'm glad people actually like the Twisted Princesses album . I love them too ! ^_^ 
UGH ! Once again , according to the stupid school system , I . DON'T . EXIST . WTFBBQROFLWEJOFANWN ????? 
To think : Back in the post-classical age , porcelain was the best thing since sliced bread ( Which hadn't been invented yet . ) and yet now we use it to crap in . :P What a strange world we live in . 
I wonder when the next friend get together should be ? I'm thinking around January when The Season of The Witch comes out . I really wanna see it . By then I'll have X-mas money too . Who wants to go with me so we can plan it ? 
Gawddamnit , < PROPMALE > Kagamine , Stop . Fucking . Dying . In . All of . Your . Songs ! You're too fucking adorable and awesome to die ! TT^TT 
\Hey do you guys wanna pop some weed ? \ " \ 
Erza : You there ! Pillar ! How dare you always keep getting in my path ?! I always have to change my direction just to go around you ! You're now my rival and I'm going to defeat you !! * 
What happened ?

100 points and a cookie goes to the people who get it . :)

Kaichou wa Maid-sama ! <3 
I'm seeing all of these things on how we should change our facebook profile pic to our favorite cartoons from when we were little to protest against child abuse , well I just realized that my Pedobear pic is probably the worse pic to choose . It's not from my cildhood , and it's a pedo . O.O \ 
Note : I still love Kaichou wa Maid-sama ! <3 
One down . Five to go . \ 
Ugh . 
Two down ( sorta ) . Three to go . This is going to be a LONG night . T T__T T 
* screams in frustration and slams head against the fridge repeatedly saying in between hits : * I . Hate . History !! AUGGGGGGGGGGGHHHH !!!! 
Alright , < PROPFIRST > , you can do it ! Two more and then you're done for the night ! You've had your dinner and your tummy's full ! No more homework until tomorrow . Let's do it ! D8 < 
Went outside for about ... 4 minutes to pee the dog in my sweater and long pants feeling really hot from sitting in one place under lights and with frustration . I came back in with my body having chills , my teeth chattering , and exhilarated . No better way to wake up a girl doing boring history homework ! :D 
Ugh . Done for the night . I'm going to bed . My brain is fried . -A- =3 
Getting started on homework part 2 . Wish me luck ! >:P 
No , word spell check , that IS how you spell that freaking word ! You're just stup- oh . Wait , I did spell that word wrong .

This guy's gonna get an ass full of pipe wrench ! XD 
Supposedly my dad's going to give me the money to pay for my permit test tomorrow !! :D Time for me to start studying for the test . :) \

Seriously people make me feel like crap . I hate you . >:( 
Grrr ... The damn cat just broke < PROPFEMALE>'s food bowl ! < PROPFEMALE>'s going to be pissed ! \

Kakashi : I'm suppose to get you to adulthood ALIVE , not uncorrupted .

< PROPFEMALE > just drove by on a fire truck . Damnit , and here I thought somebody lit a fire next door . ;) 
You know that feeling when you wake up feeling that today's going to be a perfect day and it IS ? \ 
... Yeah , me neither .

Just realized that people say ' heck ' instead of ' hell ' .... but what the hell is a ' heck ' anyway ? And who came up with it ? 
My damn cat attacked a squirrel today . My dad managed to get the squirrel away but the poor little thing seemed to have gone into shock and is resting in a certain area right now . I hope it lives . :( 
\Fishes can sense vibrators in the water . \ " -Epic fail of the Day 12/13/10 " 
I'm a heartless right now . The fact that I have destroyed some child's dream proves that . :) 
Watched the Digimon movie again . It has inspired me to rewatch the original Digimon . :D 
Let's not go to school tomorrow , waddoya say ? Sophomore skip day . :) 
Hanging out at < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST>'s . Going home around five ................ 
Slenderman . :O 
Why me ? I put my toast in the toaster for ... a minute ? After this I popped it and turned them around so that they would cook better and planned on leaving it for less than 30 seconds . < PROPFIRST > calls me . I answer and then turned back to my toast to discover that it's burnt . T T__T T 
Why is it possible to be doing so much shit and STILL be bored ? XO 
Me : * puts foot on < PROPFIRST>'s face * * < PROPFIRST > splutters and < PROPFEMALE > makes a random comment to which I responded with * Do you want to get smacked , < PROPFEMALE > ? Because I really wanna smack you . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > : < PROPFIRST>'s the one with his face on your foot ! \ 
Me : * turns to < PROPFIRST > , who's face is STILL in my foot * See ? Notice how she said that ' Your face ' is on ' My foot ' and not the other way around . 
OMG , I just finished watching Powerpuff Girls ! X3 
You know you're an anime freak when you're travelling down Wal-Mart's aisles and when you see the word ' Bleach ' you immediately think of the manga , not the product . 
Just got my permit ! 8D I'm not too bad at parking . :) 
I got my permit ! :D 
< PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPMALE >(!) just went home . We went for a long walk after visiting < PROPFIRST > . :) That was fun . 
Apparently , < PROPMALE > Tomkin and < PROPFEMALE>'s friend < PROPMALE > are almost exactly alike . I'd like to meet/talk to this < PROPMALE > and confirm this ... \ 
The original < PROPFEMALE > the Pooh Christmas special is on ! Yay ! 
If you had a short amount of time left to live , who would you want to die near and what would you tell them ? 
Well , < PROPFIRST>'s birthday is tomorrow and I'm getting kicked out of the house . Does anybody want me to < PROPFEMALE > out at their place for a few hours ? I'm a good guest when I actually try ! *_* 
God some crazy shit's going down over here with Madi Boaz , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Bowman , and < PROPFEMALE > Boaz ! :D 
Holy crap I'm in four different conversations ! D: I MUST have skills ! 
I love how when I'm talking to < PROPFIRST > via IM And he tells me \You're possibly perverted to the max\ " and then I type \ " I don't wanna be ... facebook files it as spam ! XDDDDD " 
Maddie : \What are you 
Ugh , I don't even know why I'm still up ... 
Holy crap the chicks are multiplying over here ! The Hornmeister ( < PROPMALE > ) has arrived ! 
* sigh * I feel so tired and I don't know why . I'm kinda lonely too . :( I hate being me . 
Yet I have made it here\ 
Running through all the fear\ 
The sadness in my heart retains the pain\ 
And if I fall I've learned \ 
that I may not return . \ 
-- Tear's fall like a rainstorm , I can barely see . A twisted grin broken within . Am I going crazy ? -- 
Guys piss me off . Honestly , I wish I could go around and kick any guy that pisses me off in the balls and get away with it . And for the guys on line , Facebook should seriously develop the ability to cyberly take away a guy's way to have children . \ 
With Love , \

< PROPMALE > Dunham Christmas Special's Guitar Guy ! <3 
Grandma came over . I showed her my permit and her reaction was :\ 
:o ... Oh ... Uh oh ... Somebody get me more insurance ... 
is not in a very christmas-y mood . It feels more like tomorrow is just this random day when I'm getting presents . Christmas isn't the same once the magic of it is gone . :/ 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas-\ 
Ah ! * cough * I mean ... Happy Holidays , bitches ! :D 
I'm in a t-shirt and shorts and barefoot . o.o It's cold out . 
........... :( ........ >:( .........? * sigh * 
Going to start on my history homework today .. But my mom isn't back yet with my supplies ... 
< PROPFEMALE>'s over ! This'll probably be the second night she sleeps over . :) \ 
Hm .... Trying to think of what else to draw ... 
Kito Matta Aeru . 
USODA !! D8 < 
We had a creeper following us in the car tonight . Apparently < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFIRST > ( too busy listening to their Ipods ) didn't notice , but the guy was , like , right behind us and the headlights were practically blinding the old bats . I SWORE he was one of those guys that blind you with the headlights , ram your car off the road , and then come in and stab you . It's only logical . 
* Sigh * I wanna go out with The Commissioner , but he only goes for sporty girls . T T_T T 
ADD THE COMMISSIONER AS A FRIEND AND HAVE HIM TAKE OVER THE WORLD !! JUST LOOK AT HIS EPIC PROFILE !!!! 
Stayed up all night with Madi Boaz < PROPFEMALE > Bowman and < PROPFEMALE > Boaz . ( she made it most of the night . Went to bed around 2 or so ) 
Zeh Commissioner ish ver ver popular , ne ? :D 
Kaichou wa Maid-sama ! <3 Damnit , I'm addicted . \ 
I wish I owned the Commish . 
\Road Word Ahead\ " -Construction sign I saw this morning . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > , I read what you wrote for < PROPMALE>'s basic info ( finally ! ) and I . Love . You . <3 
is hoping she'll randomly fall ill tomorrow so that she has more time to work on her B-Assignment she has been avoiding all break . 
Who else is on facebook when they should be concentrating on homework ? Raise your hand . * raises hand * 
Finished my B-Assignment ! ... Sort of . G'Night! 
You know , I've noticed that even when I'm talking to people and having fun , I'm , like , out of my body . It's like this is just a scene I'm watching but not participating in . Part of me doesn't even wanna talk to my friends . 
You can't say ' Bruhaha ' and not expect to get hit for it ! 
Girl friends opinions on boyfriends : If they like them at all ( this is for < PROPFEMALE>'s benefit because I know she'll say something about it ) than they'll support and encourage you . If he dumps you , as far as we're ( as friends ) concerned , he was a fucking dirtbag who deserves something hard and sandpapery shoved up his ass and thrown into the pits off hell . 
\I think it happens while I sleep ! \ " \ 
Camille : \Omg 
Why can something be ' overwhelming ' but not ' whelming' ? 
Shit happens . 
It hurts that I can't talk to you about these things . It hurts that you can't talk to me about these things . It hurts that I can't see you as often as I want . It hurts that you don't want to see me despite the fact that I'm a ' friend ' . It hurts that the people I trust the most are willing to turn their backs on me when they need me most . What kind of friend am I ? 
[ Poke ] me if you ever had a crush on me , or still do .. \ 
[ Like ] my status if you think i'm a good friend .. \ 
[ Message ] me if you ever wanted to be in a relationship with me .. \ 
[ Comment ] on my status if we have had good memories .. What are they ? \ 
I dare you to put this as your status . (: 
I might be going to Megacon ! :) 
Okay , so me , < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFIRST > are going to practice the Hare Hare Yukai . Cuz , < PROPFIRST > doesn't know it . :) 
Give me a nickname that only you can call me . Post this as your status and see what names you get back !! 
I've discovered that I can hardly even tell what I'm feeling anymore . Only if it's an extreme version of the emotion , and then after that I'm ... blah . Not apathetic because I feel something only I'm not sure what . And not content . That's too happy of a word . I'm so .... 
And , maybe it's a dream , maybe nothing else is real but it wouldn't mean a thing if I told you how I feel . \ 
So I'll turn off all the pain , all the misery inside and I wish that I could live feeling nothing but the night . \ 
You can tell me what to say , you can tell me where to go , but I doubt that I would care and my heart would never know . 
Rat's are extremely smart , apparently . They can get into your toilet through the pipes . They can swim for three days if needed . As long as their head fits through a tight space , their whole body will follow . O.O Rats will rule the world alongside cockaroaches one day . 
... My mom and dad are fighting and they insist that I need to be there . It's about < PROPFIRST > . This is building unwanted stress in me . FML . 
Ennui . 
They've sorta remixed the original Power Rangers theme song . 
I hate that I can sit there in the middle of class and everyone around me ( even the teacher ! ) realizes when something's wrong almost right away and doesn't mess with me , but some of my ' best ' friends can't even see that I'm any different from usual . Thank you those ' best friends ' . Thank you those people who leave me alone when I need it most . 
To anybody who reads this status :\ 
I know where you live now . Trust me . 
Ugh , for a split second I could've sworn it was Friday ... and then I realized that I had school tomorrow . 
Kids . Comments ? Concerns ? 
You're a 90s kid if ... You can finish this ' ice ice ___' , You've ever ended the sentence with ' PSYCHE!' , You still get the urge to say ' NOT ' after almost every sentence , Captain Planet : He's a hero , You had at < PROPFEMALE > ast one Tamagotchi , you did MASH to figure out your future , You remeber a time BEFORE Spongebob ( < PROPFEMALE > gasp ! ) , ... Furbies , You know the Macarena by heart . \ 
Like if you have done any of these ! 
A whole weekend withough any tv , a visit to the dump , a shitload of hand-me-downs , and a new backpack . Just another weekend at Dad's . 
If someone mentions Glee again ... X/ 
I looked back through all of the signatures I recieved during 8th grade in my yearbook and guess what ? Out of the 15 or so friends I had then , I only have 3 now . FML . 
Me : * hears knock on the door * Oops , I accidentally locked < PROPFIRST > out . * goes to the door and unlocks it*\ 
< PROPFIRST > : * opens the door wielding a hammer looking shocked * Did you lock me out ? :O \ 
Me : No , I did not lock you out , Psychotic Hammer-Wielding Maniac . O.O 
Well it's official : I'm staying up the rest of the night because of fucking WHAP . fml . Happy < PROPFIRST>'s Day , bitches . 
Exactly how long have I been working on this ...? About ... hm ... 5-7 freaking hours . UGH . Surprisingly not sleepy . Best stay-up-late combination : Reheated Japanese food and Coca-cola ! :D 
Black Cat <3 
Song of the day/week/month ? /year ? : Dead ! By My Chemical Romance 
What kind of person would you describe me as with 3 words ? 
Started growing flowers . Hope they bloom . :) 
My so-called friends aren't really being friends , recently ... :( 
Quick question , Which is more popular right now : Angel romances or vampire romances ? \ 
I think it's vampires . 
Well , I went into the bathroom and saw next to the bathroom sink , \The Chamber of Secrets has been opened . \ " Nice to see people have a sense of humor . :D " 
Going to my dad's . Gizmo's huffing and puffing ( his way of barking ) 
Three cheers for procrastinators ! 
One ... more ... chapter ! And then it's DONE !! I really hope it gets published !! 
I am so fucking pissed . < PROPFIRST > just insulted me and the story I've been working on for a whole FUCKING year ! What a bastard ! 
\I hate camoflauged clothing ! I can never find it in my closet ! \ " \ 
Tomorrow's To-Do List : School , work on epilogue for my story , type epilogue , read manga , reread my whole story to check it , and read the last bit to < PROPFIRST > . :D 
I have officially finished my story . An explosion of some sort occured somewhere down 50 . Makes me wonder ... Anybody else hear it ? 
Unfriendable.com, I love you . XD 
Megacon was amazing ! The SOS Brigade ( us ) was actually pretty popular ! We were in the shopping area pretty much the whole time , which was exhausting . I have pictures that I'll probably put up later . 
Fuck it all . Every one of my friends ' lives are shit right now and I'm tired of it . Don't think I don't feel sympathetic ; I do ! There's just a limit to my sympathy and it has been reached . I'm tired of seeing all of these depressing updates , damnit . 
Ifuckinghatethisweatherifuckinghatethisweatherifuckinghatethisweather ! TTATT I hate tornadoes !! 
Thank you , < PROPFIRST > French . You've made me LOSE THE GAME for the first time since Megacon . D: 
Hmmmmmmmmm ... You know what I hate ? Pointless updates . And periods . 
I want honest opinions on this : I need surgery to get rid of my kidney stone ( ugh ) but the thing is that I have irregular heartbeats so my doctor won't put me under anethesia (?) because I might have a heart attack because of that . So I'm going to a cardiologist , but my mom is all worried and is worrying < PROPFIRST > that I'll die so she wants me to reconsider the anethesia . I'm not worried . What do you think ? 
My heart is physically fine . 
Finally watched Paranormal Activity 2 . XD At the end , it would've been perfect if ( spoiler alert ! ) right as < PROPFEMALE > appeared , I yelled ' FINISH HER!' right before < PROPFEMALE > killed her . XDDD I was laughing so hard . Too bad I missed my < PROPMALE > . 
For those who actually care .... 
Dear boys : Are you purposely insensitive or are you just that much of an asshole ? Or is it perhaps that you're stupid ? Do you not realize what terrible things you put us girls through with your stupid antics ? Do you not realize just how much you hurt us ? When we say , \Leave me alone . \ " It translates to 
Going to the hospital for the next two nights tomorrow morning for my ' surgery ' . 
< PROPFIRST>'s toys are everywhere . It's hell on earth . D: 
' Because at Dairy < PROPFEMALE > we don't just have rainbows , we have rainbows on fire!' XD YES ! That's how you fucking do it ! 
UGGGGGGGGGHHHH !!!! I'm in PAIN !! TTATT On the bright side , sleepover and < PROPFEMALE>'s tomorrow and EPCOT on Saturday . 
* Does not have an interesting Easter joke * 
........ I really don't want to go to school Friday . 
Excalibur ~ Excalibur ~ From the United < PROPMALE > , I'm a looking for her , I'm a going to California ~ ~ Excalibur ~ Excalibr ~ ~ ! 
< PROPFIRST > ( my little bro ): * while watching < PROPFEMALE > n anime * Hey < PROPFEMALE > , why do they all bleed oil ? \ 
Me : Well you see , < PROPFIRST > , when the Bushes were still president , they wanted oil and so now all of the anime characters bleed it . < PROPFEMALE > is very powerful , you know . 
I just Higurashi-style pushed < PROPFIRST > into a wall . It was amazing ! :D 
... My mother has resorted to putting us in time-out ... . - . 
Humans : nothing more than the poisonous weeds of God's garden . 
(???) \ 
I saw Excalibur again . 
Well , my mom wants to mate our papillion Gizmo with a pomeranian , so if anybody has or knows somebody who has a female pomeranian and is willing to mate it , can you please tell me ? Paperanian puppies are adorable after all . Please tell me if you do ! 
At the library with < PROPFIRST > Oldham and Meagen Boisvert is SUPPOSE to come , though I don't know if she is anymore . Working on our WHAP review sheet . 
Party of four with < PROPFEMALE > Baxter , Meagen Boisvert , and Jorden < PROPFIRST > Oldham at the library . :D I don't think that we're going to finish two units in one day ... >.> 
... I feel so bad for my friends . My mom broke up the party in an awkward way . >.> 
Happy Mother's Day to those women who couldn't close their legs/use some kind of protection/or was stupid enough to actually WANT us little demons-on-Earth called children ! :D Love you !
