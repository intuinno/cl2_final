Apparently , I'm tryin to take Mikal Elan's bestie away from her . Lmao . 
Watching my favorite movie , Four Brothers . (: 
FOR ALL MY TRUE FRIENDS : A true friend doesn't care if your house is untidy , your car makes funny noises , if you only have $5.00 in the bank this week , or that your family is not perfect ... they love you for who you are . True friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question their friendship . REPOST if you are lucky enough ... to have at least one true friend in your life . 
So I'm gonna take the < PROPFEMALE > of solving this for my cousin ; LeBron is better than Kobe . xD 
I'm so happy right now . You guys don't even know . <3 
Wow ... You Got Served is on . I haven't seen this movie in a while .
