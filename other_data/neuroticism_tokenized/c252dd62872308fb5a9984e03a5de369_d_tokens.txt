I was just wondering if the 4th grade teachers are ready to decorate the trailer park ?, I mean the modulars . KG and I thought some pink flamingos , windmills might be a nice touch out front . 

You know it is going to be hard enough to take my son to college and go home , but I just had to say \see ya\ " to my son's best friend leaving to live in another country . OMG ! Our hearts are breaking . I didn't know how difficult this would be . " 
I had one of the best dinners ever especially because I didn't have to make it . Son's friends mom and she made us a delicious Afgan dinner . What a delightful surprise to come home to ! 
Where is everyone getting the cute little symbols ? like hearts and smiles ? 
I have just finished cleaning the 2 rooms my son and friends have occupied all summer . Fresh and clean . Now tell me why I can't wait till he comes home and trashes it ! 
You are awesome . I love you . 
To all < PROPFIRST > County residents , election day is just around the corner . Please consider voting for my husband < PROPFIRST > Hecko for < PROPFIRST > County Auditor on Nov 2nd . Thank you . 
Fall Break ! Not a minute to soon !
