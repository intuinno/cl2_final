You can explain some things to people millions of times , yet they still outright refuse to accept it ... what a waste of breath .

Happy New Year everyone , don't forget the aspirin !

Playing < PROPFEMALE > Ocean 2 .... again . 
You know ... things always seem to find a way to fix themselves ... even when it seems impossible . I feel lighter of spirt today . 
I think its sad that society has it as such that overweight people ... women specifically have to adopt this cynical , dejected view of themselves . In some places we are not even concidered people ... I am not happy that I am ' fat ' nor do I want to stay this way , and I am working on bettering myself ... but DAMMIT ! How the hell am I supposed to get better , if I feel like shit about myself constantly ? 
Instead of changing the outlook ... facebook should have done something about the craptastic messenger D=< 
A dyslexic man walked into a bra ... 
asdf ; lkuhas ; j ; eraeijrf ; osfdj ; lk -throws up arms in exasperation- 
I appologize to everyone that I was trying to have a conversation with on the messenger ... grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr they really need to do something about it already !!! 
I had a very weird .... very vivid dream last night .... it had everything ; Zombies AND Aliens !! 
Just put up my new < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > poster , and she looks stunning ~ 
I am a bit overwhelmed right now @_@ 
I am strangely at peace ... but its like the peace you feel after a long scary tumultuous storm just passed ... and everything is still in shambles ... but you are just glad its over . 
I almost forgot how much I love KMFDM <3 
Quit smoking ... been over 2 days now , going pretty good actually ^_^ haven't killed anyone yet ... but my sleeping pattern is shot to hell ... 
I hate having scary dreams that involve my apartment when I am home alone T_T 
Been drawing a lot lately ... actually got some half decent stuff down on paper for a change ^_^ 
happy 420 everyone ~ 
I am happy today . Perhaps I can keep riding this deluge of inspiration ... and not get dumped in the drink of stale ideas . 
Finally got my ps3 , add me ~ my user name is Zimfa 
Pretty sunrise this morning ~ 
-note to self- drinking 2 liters of wine is not a good idea

Ever notice how the power symbol on your computer screen looks like someone giving you the bird ? 
< PROPFEMALE > , I know you're out there somewhere , and I will find you . 
Sometimes its better to just let go of the reigns and see where life takes you ... but I have been riding the wild horse of my life way too long ... time to take control again . 
The compressor on my a/c went out ... T_T fanfuckingtastic .... 
Praying all my life did nothing for me ... now I can't have children and I am wasting away to a disease ... because he has a plan for me right ? BULLSHIT ! You want your proof ... Im living walking breathing proof that he is just some silly myth people created to explain existance . 
omg omg omg omg !!!! Lords of Acid is coming to San < PROPFIRST > August 10th !!!! -squee- 
Down with formality !.... and pants ! 
Chopped off < PROPFEMALE > hair ... pics soon . 
the PCOS has taken my ability to have children , but I don't have time to sit around and cry about it ... I need to get off my ass and start my life . Who's with me ?! 
My first product passed peer review on imvu today ! 
I did it !! I made my first room on IMVU ! ^_^ I feel so accomplished ~ 
What is up with plastic wrap !!! It NEVER works right !!! I HATE IT !!! D=< 
You know ... I am getting pretty fed up with all of this passive aggressive racism . \The actions of one person reflects upon the whole ? \ " How about growing the fuck up a little !!? -_-" 
Wondering where her best friend is ... and why he didn't answer his phone ... you better be getting some < PROPMALE > ; I will take no less excuse ... 
I am a creator ; my hands can give life or take it on a whim . I am a thinker ; I can think of a million things in an instant ... and banish them in half that . I am a daughter and woman and a wife ... But I am NOT your door mat . Get your own damn sandwich . 
I want a pet mutant midget psycho ... 
Being gluten free is fucking\ 
hard !!! I almost cried at the grocery store as I discovered more and\ 
more things I could never eat again ... ; ~ ; 
Well I made it through the first quarter of my life ... I have made it to the point I had to write about \where I want to be in 10 years\ " crap in high school ... All I have to say is HA ! I have neither the space ship OR the pool full of watermelon jello . I feel gypped ... "

A group of jellyfish is called a smack . 
Jesus was into BDSM . 
How fucking sick can you be ... making bets on whether I succeed or fail ? Tell yourself whatever you need to so that you can sleep at night ... but in the cold darkness ... when you are ALL alone ... you will know the truth ... 
Happy Thanksgiving Everyone !!!!!!!!!!!! love you all <3 
Feigned concern is worse than just not caring at all . 
Gonna do SOMETHING with my hair within the next week or so ... vote for the color ... Aqua , pink , green , or red . 
People are naturally good ... evil is something that is learned or taught . Remember that next time you are wary to accept help from a stranger ... or even give help ... its sad how thinly stretched humanity has become , but good people do still exist . Its a comforting thought to balloon you above all this mess today ... and hopefully for longer .

The Girl you just called fat ? She has been starving herself & has lost over 30lbs . The Boy you just called stupid ? He has a learning disability & studies over 4hrs a night . The Girl you just called ugly ? She spends hours putting makeup on hoping people will like her . The Boy you just tripped ? He is abused at home . There's a lot more to people than you think . Put this as your status if you're against bullying .

Okay so I went to Sushi Zushi with my besties tonight ... I got a cocktail called the Zen-Green tea tini or something like that . I wasn't drunk , but I haven't had anything to drink since October ... so I got a little tipsy . Naturally I wanted a little more to drink , and meant to ask how much a carafe of sake would be ... instead I asked ... \I wonder how much a carafe of zombie would be ? \ " \ 
A dwarf mystic escaped from prison ... the call went out that there was a small medium at large .
