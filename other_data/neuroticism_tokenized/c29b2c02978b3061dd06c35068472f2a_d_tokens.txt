Family Skate Night ! Meet us there :) 
Yes - I have children . If you come over unannounced there WILL be toys from one end of the house to the other , dishes in the sink , and there might even be crumbs on the floor . But we WILL be happy and that's all that matters to us ! My kids are making memories !!! Repost if you have a house like ours !! 
WOW ! How can I be so lucky to have 2 garage sales to donate to within a month !? 
ok , so I have a new * new strategy * . which is actually a lot like my old one but it's new now ... so , it's gotta work ! 
Help ! We need dryer advice : I just went to the Whirlpool site and scheduled someone to come out . Then I checked the reviews and they sound awful ! So , here it is : my regular ol ' electric dryer ( nothin ' fancy here ! ) spins and heats but it takes 2 full , high heat cycles to dry each load . Any advice based on experience ? other than get rid of the dryer and get out the clothes line . Texas = humidity ! 
< PROPFEMALE > just read me her monologue for next year's Thespian competition -- WOW !! I love it :) Hope friends and family will attend !!

fireworks finale = < PROPFEMALE > is officially a year older !! 
:D \ 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY to Brennon and < PROPFIRST > !!! 
what ?! \ 
we used to have to listen to fuzzy reception on the am alternative station to hear things like < PROPFEMALE > and the bunnymen ... 
it's counterintuitive . to wish the best for someone who has wronged us -- and immensely freeing to allow a vengeful impulse to waft away . i've devoted my meditative practice to you and truly wish you the very best . not because i seek to gain anything special but because you ' re pretty cool and worthy of good things . yes , you :) 
... just when I thought it couldn't get any worse . \ 
If I can get through this , I can do anything . ( Geez , what was I thinking ; trying to raise all these kids with confidence and independent minds ?! ) 
\might\ 
Last < PROPMALE > for this adorable puppy -- looking up humane society/pound options ... 
so , I did it . \ 
I held my ground . \ 
not many have experienced my unwavering strength . not many things push me this far over the edge . but I did it and now not sure which tears me up more ; that the super-adorable puppy is at the pound because we found no home for her or that I lost my family along the way . 
can't wait to hear how much < PROPFEMALE > loved her 1st day of work !! 
Yay ! Finally , my kids start school tomorrow ! I survived !! and so envious you all started way earlier ! It's been one of our longest , most transformative summers -- I'm ready to celebrate a HUGE day tomorrow , in honor of all my kids ' hard work and for all the ' firsts ' we'll see this year ... I am one proud mom , grandma , and whatever I am to Brennon . These kids are amazing ! and have proven they are capable of SO much !! 
Jet's wondering why we really need teeth anyway . 
so , beats antique it is :) 
Happy Birthday < PROPFIRST > Montessori !! 
... in need of a last-minute babysitter :( 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MOM !! 
just got home from a day of FREE yoga classes :) \ 
well , really only 2 classes and took a family movie break in between but heard someone went to 7 ! 
In AZ , I never once checked the weather -- it was either hot or searing hot ! Here , the Google says I've checked 108 times !! ... and there's always something exciting going on out there ! 
loves the < PROPFEMALE > tonight . go check it out -- hope it's beautiful for you too :) 
Oh , the choices this stay-at-home , i.e. , never home , grandma has to make : body combat , Tibetan Heart or moderate flow yoga ? 
ok , I'm humbled . \ 
now where are my keys ? 
yes , I am at carmax ... 
I was in fitness heaven today ! \ 
Pilates , Zumba , < PROPFEMALE > and Yoga -- cross-training with my favorite classes , all in 1 day ! 
is making boarding plans for < PROPMALE > -- \ 
Let me know if you want to make $$$ this winter by keeping a very awesome , well-behaved , potty-trained , indoor , family & kid-friendly Black Lab for 20 days !! 
am I really skipping my a.m workout ( pilates and zumba ) to bake for College night/Senior Celebration ?! \ 
hmm . this could be dangerous ... 
< PROPMALE > ? < PROPFEMALE > ? All you UT kiddos OK ?? 
I've just won the ' Boring Mom Award ' : < PROPFIRST > asked me who I'm inviting to my Birthday party . I wasn't\ 
even planning one so I asked what he had I mind -- \You could have a ( get this ... )* cleaning party * and invite friends and play ! I mean 
Happy Birthday < PROPMALE > ! 
who can sell me call of duty 5 for 20$ 
ok , I approve -- any teens with Xbox 360 games to sell , run ' em by us first ! < PROPFIRST>'s saving up for a few on his list ... 
celebrating 36 years of life , my 9th year of yoga , 4 years in the same city/state/house ( longest we've ever been in one place ! ) , < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > were at work by 4am and the boys were off to school on time ! New beginnings ROCK !! \ 
* You're invited to < PROPFEMALE > out with me tonight ! Message me if you want to come along ! * 
Birthday wishes are awesome !!! \ 
Thanks guys :) 
Hey , Pflugerville peeps ! \ 
If you're planning to go to the Hendrickson Homecoming game/Senior Night this Friday and you have a camera , will you please snap a few pictures of us ? \ 
< PROPFIRST > and I will be busy walking out with our li'l girl to commemorate her last marching season and then at halftime , she'll be in the Homecoming Court and all I have is my little cell phone camera . Let me know , Thanks !

AAAAAHHHHHHHH !!!!!!!! \ 
I'M FREAKINGGGGG OUTTTT !!!!! 
We have another speller in the family ! 
my comfort zone is calling me :D \ 
we're packing to move ! 
Happy Halloween :) 
sorry , no time to fb . just wantin ' y'all to know that moving is , in fact , freakin ' hard ! and not to come over because it looks like a tornado blew through ! we'll have a bunch of stuff for sale/donation/freecycle soon :D \ 
that is all . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > on . 
Speaking of things we are thankful for , I am thankful for all the brushes with death I have encountered and lived to not talk about . \ 
\ 
Oh yeah , and I am also thankful for my spam filter . 
WWWOOOOO !! \ 
San < PROPFIRST > just called and want us back . Although , it's about 14 years ahead of schedule and I had just about decided to make < PROPFIRST > our forever home -- I was just planning a simple road trip for this summer ... \ 
but wow . See how we get what we ask for !? 
I know it's gonna be a great day when < PROPFIRST > Aeilli says , \Let's start with the Black Keys . \"" 
I am SO thankful for the excitement I get each day while cleaning up ! I\ 
find the strangest things in the refrigerator and garbage disposal !! \ 
This morning , while the house was uncommonly quiet ( because the boys were all out buying a new dustpan to sweep up the broken glass one of my independent boys accidentally broke -- 
Please\ 
put this on your status if you know someone or are related to someone\ 
who has been eaten by dragons . Dragons are nearly unstoppable and they\ 
can breathe fire . 93% of people won't copy and paste this , because\ 
theyhave been eaten by dragons or don't believe in dragons . 6% of\ 
people aresitting in the shower armed ... with fire extinguishers , \ 
whilst the remaining 1% are awesome and will repost this 
beginning to wonder if I can really do all this by myself ! \ 
AHHH ! \ 
Blissful Freefall , baby ! I have to keep reminding myself , \there is no ground \"" 
so\ 
yeah , I know my mile-time has almost doubled from 8 minutes when I was\ 
16 to almost 15 minutes now , but being passed up by people way heavier and 20+\ 
years OLDER than me in the 5K this morning -- ouch . My ego tripped over\ 
it's shoelaces and fell splat on it's face :D It's a good thing I had a blast at < PROPFIRST > Park & Pizza with a bunch of groovy kiddos and now we're off to downtown < PROPFIRST > ! ( there , there little ego ) 
so now that we're halfway out the door with this move and almost all our stuff is in a storage unit , it's pretty safe to say we're not moving . \ 
details will follow . 
Most people have 1000 wishes for Christmas ; a cancer patient only has one , to get better . I know 97% of you won't repost this to your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do . In honor of someone who has died , is still fighting , or has survived cancer , copy this to your status in their honor !!! 
Only great things ! From now on , only FANTASTIC things will happen ! 
Possibly , I forgot to be thankful sometime during the past 4 thousand days or so . Most likely , not . I am certainly really-super thankful now . 
I LOVE sharing our awesome Hawk Band with AZ ! Seeing our new hometown band march in my original hometown , in a parade I used to march in -- such a cool thing !! 
celebrating 17 years of marriage today ! 
just want to take a minute to shout out to the world ( even if it's only in < PROPFEMALE > facebook-world font ) that I LOVE MY JOB !!!!! 
poker night . \ 
yeah , you heard me . 
Happy Birthday Jet ! 
Quick ! \\nHow many calories are in a cupcake ? 
Well , by golly , if all my boy excels at academically is reading and taking tests , I'll just have to support him in that . We're off to start another venture -- tirelessly searching for the recognition he deserves .
