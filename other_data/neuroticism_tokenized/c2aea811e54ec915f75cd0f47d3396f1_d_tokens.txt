2010 . and 3 hours ... 

Concrete and cars are there own prison bars like this life I'm living in . But the ship brought me farther , I'm surrounded by water , and I'm not going back again . Adios and vaya con dios , yeah I'm leaving NC . 
Time to sleep . 
Absolutely nothing . 
Watching the internet and surfing the tv 
Needless to say , I am not a very happy camper . In fact , I am an angered camper . 
I think I'm turning Japanese , I think I'm turning Japanese , I really think so ! 
Would much rather be sleeping , than going to work right now ... 
You know I like my Chicken Fried ... 
Hold on tight , cause its gonna be wilder than any 8 second ride ! 
Getting ready to go fail a business computers exam in a few minutes . An exam worth 35% of my final grade . Yay ! 
2011 ! 
ITS SNOWING !! 
Finally supposed to get some warm weather today for a change ! I guess that means I have no excuse to work outside this morning ... 
Walk to UNCC . 
Run from UNCC ! 
I don't want to wait 30 minutes to go back in the water 
The secret side of me , I never let you see , I keep it caged but I can't control it . So stay away from me , the beast is ugly . I feel the rage and I just can't hold it . It's scratchin ' on the walls , In the closet , in the halls , It comes awake and I can't control it . Hidin ' under the bed , In my body , in my head . Why won't somebody come and save me from this ? Make it end ! 
Luckily I dodged the cat scratchinf post thrown at me , but unfortunately , I got a huge hole in my wall now . Thanks . 
Go DUKE . 
Just got back fom the Skillet concert . Awesome show !! 
Playing real-life farmville . A little tougher , but at least you get real food . out of it ... :) 
Ok . SO now it smells like a bunch of chickens took a dump in my car . Even though I rode around with the windows open and the tops off . nasty stuff . 
I'm not real excited that the wrapping on my toilet paper said ' 100% Recycled ' . 
is comforting the disturbed , disturbing the comfortable , interesting the bored and boring the interested . 
Just got my fender and Passenger side mirror in today ... Everything looks good ... ( I'll have to inspect it more closely tomorrow ... ) I had to return the headlight I ordered on eBay ... I paid $270 and it was in terrible condition , bent pieces , missing pieces , etc ... 
3 More Hours and I'll be a Free Bird !! 
I've read the rules . I've tried the rules . The rules are stupid , & I'm making my own from now on . 
Huked on fonics werked four me ! 
Remember , the average response time to a 911 call is over 4 minutes ... \ 
The average response time of a 357 magnum is 1400 Feet Per Second ! 
Going to the beach .... Bear Island . I hope to finally see some bears ... But I'm not gonna count on it .... I got my beach chair and an umbrella just in case though ... 
Boo hiss 
I'm an angry elf

Had to tow my car home late last night , and then drop it off on the road , and push it to the grass ... It looks like a drunk person tried to parallel park my car last night ... the back half of it is on the road , and the front half of it is on the grass ... The neighbors will think that ... haha 
Only 268 days till summer !! 
An SS looks like it could kick your butt if it wanted to , but a WS6 looks like it's coming over to do it ! 
Going to the < PROPFEMALE > race !! 
Grrrrrrrrrrrrrr ! 
Panthers finally won a game ... Shocking ! 
Had\ 
to run over 1/2 mile in the flash-flood rain from my class back to my \ 
car ... No umbrella ... And it was dark , so I didn't miss many puddles ... \ 
Now I am as soaked as if I jumped into a pool ... At least it was 75 , so \ 
it wasn't AS cold as could have been !! \ 
\ 
Makes me glad that I didn't ride my bike to school though :) .... 
Hey Mr Policeman ..... Bet I can drive faster than you can ... Come \

Go Panthers . They are going to win , now that they the new QB 
I just got caught up in a huge mob of zombies , on my way to class , and scared the crap out of me ! Luckily I wasn't infected !! There was about 100 of them , that came out of no where . 
1342 awesome . Very creative , and you should be a songwriter or poet or something . That's all I have to say , because I don't like using lots of words ... lol :)

Mikey is the neatest thing that ever happened to me ! I love my biggest brother ! Thanks for everything < PROPFIRST > !!!!

All my wisdom is now gone . Not that I had much to start with .... 
Snow snow snow snow !!! 
The 6 hour trip to Florida that took 8.5 hours because we had to stop 8 times = Fail . 
There's nothing wrong with a hard hat and a hammer . The kinda glue that sticks the world together . Hands of steel , and cradle of the promise land , God bless the working man . 
Gonna feel nice to sleep in my own bed for the first time in almost 2 weeks !! Good to be back in < PROPFEMALE > ! 
GOODBYE FACEBOOK FOR A WEEK !!

When I went into one of the kindergarten classes to tutor a couple days ago while the regular teacher was taking the day off , one of the students asked if the regular teacher was \dead . \ " Another kid was convinced that I was < PROPFIRST > Hawk . And a little girl said that I have the same exact shoes that she was wearing . It must be very interesting to be a kindergarten teacher !! LOL "
