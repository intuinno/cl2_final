There's always a \ 
little truth behind every ' just kidding , ' a little emotion behind every \ 
' I don't care , ' and a little pain behind every ' It's okay . ' < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > 
i'm tired of being sick :( 
Pray for me , stand by me but don't cry for me ............ I just got handed a big ole box of lemons , who's got sum sugar ? ;) once the fire is not but ambers and ashes this bird will take flight ........... i always do , just a lil bit slower this time 
Ok so i'm sittin here thinkin how havein liam for < PROPFEMALE > was a blessin for me or i would have not known till it was to late but not everyone can and will have the same twist of fate as i did so i wanna share signs i got so u can b more aware as my family cause it can b past on but can also go unnoticed or missed , again 
< PROPFEMALE > i learned we were havin a liam for sure i started fellin tired very easy , short of breath and < PROPFEMALE > i would simply stand up my heart would race makin me feel sick dizzy and weak , i figured it was cause i was carryin another boy which i told < PROPFEMALE > he was from the beginin cause i had felt the same way with < PROPFIRST > but liam was worse(now i wonder if that was warnin signs of ph and not of a boy)either way i was 
certain < PROPFEMALE > was finaly gettin that bounin baby boy . as i got bigger with liam the feelin got worse but i assumed it was due to all the extra weight , after he was born and i was back in louisiana i was up late makin my boy a cup of milk < PROPFEMALE > i blacked out and was awoken by sumone in the house , twice this happen in one night ....... sumthing 
was not right . I was still feelin all the other signs but had guessed my body was simply tired from the 6 kids i have carried(don't assume about ur health)but i wanted a doctor to tell me i was ok(that and < PROPFEMALE > wouldn't shut up , lol)after many test ran by a new doctor we found the pulimenary hypertention , ph , which explained all i felt , but 
then one of the other test came back not so good , young red blood count of a normal woman my age is around 20 , 000 , mine is sittin at 7 , 000 , which calls for a very uncomfortable test , bone marrow removed from hip and bone itself :( now we r waitin to see which culprit is causin this low count and goin from there 
.................. in a way its nice to know what is goin on cause i knew i simply didn't feel nor look like me anymore , but didn't know why , < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > and liam , now with answers and treatment maybe i'll get to see me 
Prognosis : The prognosis depends on the specific disease . Some cases may stop progressing or improve , particularly if the cause can be identified and treated . Others may develop quickly or slowly into end-stage lung disease . The course of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is very difficult to predict ; however , average survival is approximately five to seven years . well that just sucks 
another day ......................... :)
