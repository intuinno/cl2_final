“Love is the ultimate outlaw . It just won't adhere to any rules . The most any of us can do is to sign on as its accomplice . Instead of vowing to honor and obey , maybe we should swear to aid and abet . That would mean that security is out of the question . The words \make\ " and \ " stay\ " become inappropriate . My love for you has no strings attached . I love you for free . ”\ 
Happy 1/11/11 day !!! 11/11/11 Day is just around the corner !!!! 
\I will vote to repeal the law . I do not want people on our roads that are under the influence . \ " \ 
\Medical marijuana is a problem . Should it be repealed ? I have received\ 
R I P < PROPFIRST > Lalane ... 
Hey everybody , HB 43 is being discussed today , and its a bad < PROPMALE > ! \ 
This < PROPMALE > would allow an employer to dismiss an employee simply for having a medical cannabis card . It also allows employers to denying hiring to anyone registered as a medical cannabis patient . Please call your representative or fax or email your concerns . This would basically put 31,000 out of work ... is that a good plan for economic stimulus ? 
Really needs a massage ... huge knot under left shoulder blade ...

Repealing local ordinances , repealing citizen initiatives , doubling the number of names required to get an initiative on the ballot - uh , i think legislators are supposed to REPRESENT the will of the people not fight against it and try to squash it . What a disconnect .

There's no way to rule innocent men . The only power any government has is the power to crack down on criminals . Well , when there aren't enough criminals , one makes them . One declares so many things to be a crime that it becomes impossible to live without breaking laws . – Ayn Rand

Re : Repeal- No new cards to be issued effective immediately . Voted in 12-0 . 
HB 161 tied up 6-6 . Subcomittee to be appointed ... 
It appears the Federal gov't and DEA is taking actions across the state . We do not have specifics to the extent of this action , but it appears to be significant . If you become aware of an action please call 406 890 3845 to report it . 
If there had been any pets on the grounds at these production facilities or dispensaries they surely would have become casualties with agents barging in yelling , dressed in black , and guns drawn ... Caregivers , leave your pets at home !!!! 
During the raids shop owners were told it did not matter that they were in compliance with state law , this is a federal law .

and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a communist . \ 
Then they came for the trade unionists , \ 
and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a trade unionist . \ 
Then they came for the Jews , \ 
and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a Jew . \ 
Then they came for me\ 
and there was no one left to speak out for me . 
Which represents the real danger - a plant .. or armed thugs with loaded guns kicking in the doors of law abiding Montana small businesses ? 
No blast motion today !!!!!!! 
U.S. Attorney for the District of Montana < PROPFIRST > Cotter says , \When criminal networks violate federal laws those involved will be prosecuted . \ " The criminal networks he is talking about are legitimate caregivers and their operations operating LEGALLY in our state but ILLEGALLY according to FEDERAL law ...

Sen. < PROPFIRST > Caferro , D-Helena , said she doesn’t think it would be bad to have the repeal referendum on the ballot in 2012 . \ 
“I don’t think we should underestimate this voting bloc , ” she said of medical marijuana users .

VIA < PROPFEMALE > Springman-Pincolini :\ 
The lady at the Governor's office told me this morning that the calls have been about equal for repeal and veto ~ time to step up our game , folks . Keep the calls rolling in 406-444-3111 Veto HB161 & SB423 
URGENT !!!! Just received a tip on hotline !!!!! Drug Task Froce going state wide to count plants and cards , looking for caregiver to caregiver , if not enough plants so it seems , and to make sure all plants are labeled to specific patients . Please advise if you hear more . Last report was they were in Big Timber . Be prepared folks ! Be in order ! 
Oh boy ! The Playa dreams have started already this year ! Very fancy gear people were bringing this year ... 
Remember when teachers , public employees , Planned Parenthood , and PBS crashed the stock market , wiped out half of our 401Ks , took trillions in TARP money , spilled oil in the Gulf of Mexico , gave themselves billions in bonuses , and paid no taxes ? Yeah , me neither . Re-post if you can't remember , either . 
HB161 VETOED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Please take a moment to thank the Governor !!! 
Progressive thinking has always been persecuted by the establishment . The first writer of the protestant bible was burned at the stake two years before England accepted it as its first bible ... We are the leaders , my friends ! History will look favorably on us !!! 
Salary of the US President ... $ 400,000 . Salary of retired US Presidents ... $ 180,000 . Salary of House/Senate ... $ 174,000 . Salary of Speaker of House ... $ 223,500 . Salary of Majority/Minority Leaders ... $ 193,400 . Average US Salary ... $ 33,000 to $ 77,000 . HELLO ! I think we found where the cuts should be made ! If you agree repost !!! These number don't include expense accounts 
Everyone needs to spread the word that we have NO ALLIES on the joint Senate/House committee to work on SB423 !!! Even the Democrats on this committee have clearly stated that their goal is to \take the money out\ " of the industry and to shrink patient < PROPFIRST > !!!! Tell the Gov . to VETO SB423 !!!!!!! " 
One of the ways YOUR legislature is protecting you from the medical marijuana SCOURGE : If you are providing cannabis-infused products made in your kitchen for even just a family member , you must by law use separate pans and cooking utensils in order to produce the products . ( Are they going to arrest people for making omelettes in cootied-up “pot pans . ”) 
Be sure when you write your legislators that you do not just ask them to endorse the \Grey < PROPMALE >\" . The reason is that SB 423 is considered a grey < PROPMALE > at this point and it could cause some confusion when you are asking legislators to support the \ " Grey < PROPMALE>' . Tell them vote no on SB423 !!! Tell them to support the amendments in SB 154 !!! "

These are our FRIENDS in the House : < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > Furey , < PROPMALE > Hale , < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > Hill , < PROPMALE > Hollenbaugh , Krayton Kerns , < PROPFEMALE > Malek , < PROPFEMALE > McClafferty , < PROPFIRST > Noonan , < PROPFIRST > Read , < PROPFEMALE > Teinhart , < PROPFEMALE > Squires , Franke < PROPMALE > . Please send them your thanks , not your wrath . 
< PROPMALE > Doctor just talked to the DPHHS and the word is if you have a card expiring on or before June 15th you can get it renewed using the current rules , until May 15th . Anything submitted after May 15th will be returned . So in short if anyone wants protection they need to get a new card or have their existing card renewed by May 15th . Contact < PROPMALE > Doctor with any questions or call DPHHS 444-2037 . 
SB 423 Fun Fact #1 : If only 20,000 of the 30,000 patients tried to renew their cards , we would need over 800 doctors to EACH recommend 25 patients . Currently only ~ 350 doctors have recommended patients at all . ( After recommending 25 patients per year to the program a physician is AUTOMATICALLY targeted for an investigation by the Board of Medical Examiners , an investigation he/she must pay for ) . 
Please call in if you are attending Thursdays silent vigil in Whitefish . 7:00 pm 605-475-4800 code 859198# It should take 10 -20 minutes . also Red Lion Inn Kalispell will have special rates from 4th - 9th , call 1-800-Red-Lion mention mmga .

I am incredibly sad and dissapointed that there is now NO CANDIDATE who will stand up for the rights of patients and will be pro cannabis in the state for governor ... A dark day indeed ...

Saw two and a half mormons today .... 
was just reading the new issue of Playboy , which has 2 great articles on how drug enforcement policies and programs help support terrorism and how the philosophy of AA is flawed and the founder thought LSD was a great treatment for alcoholism !!!!!!!! 
Just had to flag down a cop to let him know his cherries were on and he didn't know ... Funny thing is he said it happens more than you would think .... :-) 
Was blessed to be a part of a beautiful union ! Congratulations , < PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > . May you two have many wonderful years together . 
Screw it , I'm going to burning man ..... 
Good bye , Missoula . See you in october ! 
Chillin in Wells , NV ... On the way to the playa ! 
Going off the grid ! See you in two weeks ! 
Finally in Chico ! All my norcal and Chico peeps give me a holler !!!! 
Where is the electronic music in chico ? 
Got to spend some time last night with some great people and good friends ... Going to go swimming at one mile park today ... Got to do something to best this humid heat ! 
I know they have an incredibly difficult job , but it seems more and more that the law enforcement community has forgotten that their job is to serve and protect , not to intimidate and instill fear in the citizenry ... They seem to look at EVERYONE as criminals , they just need to figure out HOW you have broken the law ... 
The complete and utter lack of whomp and wobble in this town amazes and astounds me ... Missoula has spoiled me ...

Broke 800 friends today .... kinda cool . Hope to see some of my Nexican brethren while I'm here in the greater Chico area .... Going for a cheesesteak now !!!!!! 
Any chico peeps who want to < PROPFEMALE > out tonight give me a buzz at 406-544-4404 . < PROPFEMALE > and I are out on the town tonight ... 
Chico world music festival !!!! 
I was told today that the reason there is no electronic music scene in chico is because there is an anti-rave ordinance in the city ... But you can have all the rock and roll and booze you want ... Seems fair , right ? 
Hanging out in beautiful Portland with good friends < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > !

Back in Missoula tomorrow ..

because hb 391 goes into effect tomorrow october first , missoula's lowest priority initiative in regards to marijuana is no longer in effect . Any marijuana related offenses from this point forward are treated like any other criminal offense . 
we QUALIFIED for the 2012 ballot officially !!! 
the sky looks like an oil painting tonight 
Brooklyn Kittelson is sending a call to artists and musicians for the Saturday the 15th Occupy < PROPMALE > Jam from 12-10 PM at the courthouse . We are lacking committed bands and musicians . Can you pass the call along . This will be a fun way to get involved and raise moral as Occupy Missoula enters its second week .
