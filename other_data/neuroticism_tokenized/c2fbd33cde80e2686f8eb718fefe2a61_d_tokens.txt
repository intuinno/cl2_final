lovin ' this summer weather <3 
stupid boy you can't fence that in , stupiud boy it's like holding back the wing , she laid her heart and soul right in your hands 
I should have been chasing you , I should have been trying to prove , that you were all that mattered to me , I should have said all the things , that I kept inside of me and maybe , I could have made you believe , that what we had was all we ever need . 
knoebels w/ the fam for the day . text <3 
She said I want something else , To get me through this , Semi-charmed kind of life baby baby , I want something else , Im not listening when you say , Good-bye <3 
bed .. work in the am 
so hold on tight and jump in =] 
breathe , just breathe , take the world off your shoulders , and put it on me breathe , just breathe , let the life that you live , be all that you need <3 
Oh , oh Evacuate the dancefloor Oh , oh I’m infected by the sound Oh , oh Stop this beat is killing me , Hey little DJ let the music take me underground ? 
breathe just breathe take the world off your shoulders and put it on me , breathe just breathe let the life that you live be all that you need <3 
She's got a smile like california , she's got a spirit like new orleans , eyes like the lights of new york city , yeah , calm as a < PROPFEMALE > breeze , but underneath , she's got a heart like memphis <3 
loves the feeling of the oncoming storm =] 
Windows down as the night blows in , Tap the beat on the wheel as the tires spin , Until we're there crank the radio , We'll join in with the songs we know Hey , everything's right , said everything's right tonight <3 
I been guilty of sayin ' no when I could have said yes ; My heart's history , well it hasn't been the best ; But this time I'm trusting in somebody other then me ; I built the walls tall , now there gonna fall ; Got no more secrets to keep ; No more protecting my heart <3
