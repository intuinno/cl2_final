Happy New Years Everyone ! 

Not feeling well ... :( 
So today , I'm a pink leopard named Itchy ! :( * sighs * 
unwell and unhappy ... Just want to go back home to my beloved , and the annoying < PROPFEMALE > . * sighs * :( 
Well I found a new online game I just love . Evony is pretty neat ... you get 7days to improve a city , get military together , and make alliances ... after that you can get attacked by or attack other cities . It's a grand scale chess game if you will ... but w 
I've been getting too much into the UHC subject . I'm so against it because I know what it will be like , but I keep hearing Liberals say how great it will be . It's already in force with Medicaid , and they can't even make that work right . If you can't make 
It's strange ... why are some people so irrational ? They disrespect another person , then feel like they got injured , and totally snap , leaving the actual injured party feeling like ' WTF just happened ? ' Very sad that some people treat a supposed loved one so badly and instead of calling to apologize for their wrong , they call only to make it worse by repeating those hurtful words . * sighs * 
Why are men so difficult ! :P 
For those of you that care ... Happy half-way to St. < PROPFIRST>'s day ! 
One minute he's so affectionate ... the next he sticks his claws into you for attention ... why is my cat such a drama < PROPFEMALE > ? :P 
Is missing her dearest ... :( * sighs * 
Shaking terribly ... nervous shock ... hoping tomorrow will be a better day . * SIGHS * 
So you all know that I have a cat ... well funny thing is that < PROPMALE > turned out to be a girl ... How you say ? I'm not quite sure , but she even had the vet fooled . Naughty girl ! :P Anyway , her name is now < PROPMALE > ( but now pronounced Mo-zee ) < PROPFEMALE > Gray ... as < PROPFEMALE > Gray was the name we gave her before she started ' looking like a man . ' lol 
It's Monday , and I'm so happy ! Just five more days , yay ! :] 
Oh this is funny ... I have a news feed from Oct 17 that just jumped to the most recent updates ... above the ones for today . What is wrong with Facebook ? 
Take a moment today to remember all those veterans old and new who make our freedom possible ... If your near one give them a big hug and thank you ! Happy Veteran's Day ! :] 
Is anyone else having trouble accepting fb gifts from apps ? Every time I click accept it puts it under ignore ... too weird ? :( 
When doing your Christmas cards this year , take one card and send it to this address : A Recovering American Soldier c/o < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Army Medical Center 6900 < PROPFEMALE > Avenue , NW Washington , D.C. 20307-5001 . Think of how many cards these wonderful people who have sacrificed so much would get . PLEASE RE-POST ! :] 
Happy Thanksgiving to everyone ! Eat and drink ( but not too much , ) have lots of fun with your families and be thankful ... laugh , be happy and even merrier today ... * HUGS * 
So my household is sick now ... but we will get better soon thanks to the soupy goodness a dear friend brought over . :] 
:( I've got a fever ... 
My crazy cat is driving me up the wall ! :P 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas to all ... and to all a wonderful day ! :] 
So I'm still sick here ... watching Fantasia 2000 but only cause it's what my little < PROPFEMALE > wanted to see . She loves looking at the pictures , staring at the TV like a 2yr old ... lol . :P 
Sick at home ... cold got worse and I feel like my right side is heavy for me . I just wish it was much warmer outside so I wouldn't feel so cold inside . :( 
ATTENTION MIAMI PEOPLE : Large truck that will be on the corner of 1st & < PROPMALE > beginning at 6:00 pm today and will be there 24/7 until it is filled . Items most needed : blankets , tents , batteries , candles , clothing , medicine and canned food . PLEASE REPOST !! 
Some people are beyond hope ... they throw poo at it and get angry at the giver , not realizing that it comes from someone who understands , who comes from the same corner and wants to share the hope that was given to them . I do not understand people , but now I do understand why some people don't get what they want . ( Btw , this has nothing to do with politics . ) 
Being sick is no fun at all , but what's worse is when you get better only to get sick again . :( 
Tylenol , what a miracle drug you are . Keeping fevers at bay , while I will the hours away ... sleeping . But not another word , as my throat is quite raw and my head flushed warm by this delirium . Blessed is God for giving us such a < PROPMALE > to rid of the turmoil , this unrest with such a little pill as thee is . 
Feeling better but still pretty sick ... I hope everyone else is fairing better than me . :o ] 
So I'm finally awake from such a long and strange sleep . God I hate being sick , sleeping from night to late afternoon , eating crap , and taking meds . Not my day of fun ... at least coughing is at a minimal . :( 
Why is it that the very thing to make you well can make you feel more sick than you are ? * sighs * 
Yay ! The saints won , horay for the underdog ! :o ) 
I have spent the past few days looking up family history and filling my family tree . :o ] 
So now colored Peeps come in green and orange ... I feel that soon they'll run out of colors and start on flavors . :P Just imagine , an orangy tasting Peeps ! ;) 
I just want to thank everyone for the birthday wishes ! They've made me smile ... :o ) 
Got a horrible headache now ! :( 
Ok , who wants to go see the ' Sorcerer's Apprentice ' on June 16 ? ( I will be in Miami that day . ) 
Sick today , still ... Damn I hate sneezing ! But at least my throat isn't as sore , just dry and a little painful when I swallow . I have finished a whole bottle of lemonade and of soda , and a half gallon of cold water in just 3 days . \ 
\ 
Anyway , I'm off to finish a artistic challenge that could possibly get me strangled by my sister if it doesn't come out right . Wish me lots of luck ! 
My head feels like a stuffed balloon ! :( 
On a philosophical note :\ 
So , according to Dovid Krafchow author of Kabbalistic Tarot , the thousand years of peace that man ( humans ) will enter is called \The Thousand Years of Woman . \"" 
* Huffs*\ 
I've got a headache , but unfortunately ' Problems ' don't care ! :-[ 
They say true friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question their friendship . These types of friends pick up just like they spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been or how far apart they live ... REPOST this if you are lucky enough to have at least one friend like this . ? ~ :) 
My cat is watching Racing Stripes , to my amazement . Who knew she loves horses and zebras . ;P 
Knitting a scarf today ... anyone need one ? ;P 
\Let's have a bite ! \ " ;-) " 
I am missing the < PROPMALE > ... badly ! :( 
I want to send a shout out to all the past , present , and future Veterans out there , \THANK YOU for your sacrifices and keeping our Nation a free and wonderful place to live ! \ " \ 
My cat was obviously made for me ... she loves watching old < PROPFEMALE > Hepburn movies as much as I do ! :) 
Just listened to an awesome band ... Signal2 you rock ! \ 
:-D 
Wii ... A wonderful little device that is allowing me to watch Ponyo for the first time . Yay ! \ 
:-) 
I had left for a while ... I will try not to be gone too long again , otherwise farmville takes over my pages . Strange for a game I liked and played I feel it is possibly time to delete it's posting abilities . I have no choice as this is supposed to be about me , and not silly farmville ! \ 
* annoyed * \ 
:-/ 
Lets see how creative my facebook friends are ! Leave me a one word comment that describes me using the THIRD letter of your first name .... it can only be one word .... then copy and paste this to yr wall so I can leave a word about you .... don't just post a word & not copy ! You will spoil all the fun :D 
So went to the gallery yesterday , and I hated my entry ! God I'm like every other artist huh ... * sighs * 
I can not wait ! Sushi in about an hour from now ... Yahoo !!! :-D
