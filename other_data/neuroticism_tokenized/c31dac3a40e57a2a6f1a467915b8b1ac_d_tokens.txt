I just got done cleaning up cat puke . Them hairballs with getcha everytime . Now I'm trying to download some pictures and it's driving me crazy ! -sigh- The only thing that I'm looking forward to today is my interview at 3 o'clock . 
I just got back from my interview . It was a lot of info to take in , but if I work nights and it's not busy , it shouldn't be anything that I can't handle . I just have to memorize . There are 6 people getting interviewed and she's only employing 2 . She plans on calling the people that she chooses , Thursday . Cross you fingers ! 
I GOT THE JOB ! SQUEAL ! YAY ! 
People need to understand that children with special needs don't have an illness , so there is no cure & it's not contagious . They only want what we all want , to be accepted . Most of you probably won't copy and paste this . Will you do it and leave it on your status for ...... at ... least an .... hour ? It's Special Education week , and .. th ... is is in honor ofall the kids who need a little extra help & understanding 
Ugh . I'm so bored . I feel like my head is gonna blow ...

-yawn- Sleepy ... 
I go to training today at 4 to fill out paperwork . Fun fun . Wish me luck ! 
I got back from training . It was fun and I think that I'll enjoy working there . The people I worked with today are nice and patient with me . I need all the help I can get ! < PROPFEMALE > , the supervisor that worked today , said that I'm a fast learner . I hope she's right . 
Today's just one of those days . Chest feels hallow and I wanna crawl in a corner and bawl my eyes out . -sigh- I really hate hormones . 
I can't stop thinking about yesterday ... I had SOOO much fun hangin ' down town with my friends ... IT WAS EPIC ! Lots of good memories . = ^w^ =

is angry and sick of her parents blaming other people for their own daughter's choices for her lifestyle . It's not her friends ' faults for her trying something new or start to explore different areas and believe systems . JUST LAY OFF !!! 
My parents need to learn to lemme go . They think I'm getting myself in trouble , because I wanna < PROPFEMALE > with people that I love and care for . I say , to hell with it and lemme learn from my own mistakes . Although loving and caring for someone is hardly a mistake . All in favor of dethroning my parents , say < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Gnight . everyone ! \ 
I love you all ! \ 
Sweet dreams . 
Why is it that every time I'm on the computer ( or trying to get on ) my dad always asks who I'm trying to talk to ... it's starting to get really annoying ...

I dunno what to do ... I wanna talk to you , but I'm scared you'll explode at me ... I'm scared the words will come out wrong and I'll screw up .. we just need to both keep our heads , stay calm , and talk . Please ... 
Ugh . Why do I have to push myself so hard when it comes to my academics ? Being an emotional wreck really interfers with your school work . It'll take me forever to get my paper done . T.T 
Has gotta get all this emotional shit together if she wants to get anything done . 
I can't stop smiling for the life of me . It's very nice to be this happy . <3 = ^w^ =\
