Phew ! Sure can get off on a tangent following other people's interests and friends on their walls . Could spend days here . Gotta go throw something out . 
What's on my mind ? More rain , lightning and wind . Did I say more rain ! Argh !!! At least we're close to a record for wettest July on record . If we're going to be miserable , we may as well have it recorded as some kind of record ! Glad we didn't do a garden this year . I hate watching carrots drown .

I decided to see who was running for offices in Wisconsin this November ... besides the vote \D\ " for \ " duped\ " or \ " R\ " for \ " ripped off\ " . Not too many 3rd party candidates and some of those are questionable . Not a lot of info on each candidate but the links at the bottom for information on different parties were quite interesting . Constitutional sounded good until I read it . No .... not that one ! lol " 
Okay , that wasn't me that said the word \amazing\ " . It was from the previous sender ! But .... the video is worth watching . What a world and what it'll be according to projections . Can we trot this fast ? " 
61 today . I'd never have guessed I'd get this old .... and hope to get older if all goes well ! lol

Hope everyone is rolling around on the floor moaning from eating lots of good food ! And enjoying whatever company is about . We went non-traditional and had pork chops , Spanish rice and apple-cranberry pie . Yum ! I wonder if the Pilgrims knew about this ? Then we hugged up all our furry family and we're grateful . 
While lots of folks were out shopping we were home getting a fresh , bright , clear view of the world through our new replacement windows ! Ah ! It's great ! Warmer in the house . I can actually SEE without looking through a fog .... oh wait .... there's still that fog in my mind to contend with ! lol 
Oh , foo ! Guess I have to do something today . I'm so absorbed in The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo that I don't want to put it down . Gotta get in line for book 2 ! 
The new kid on our block ! This is Sir Fokey P . Farkle . Isn't he just too dang cute ! 
I hope that all of you are enjoying your holiday .... even those who are working ! Someone's gotta do it ! 
< PROPFIRST>'s post further down on Feb . 18th at 07:00 & 06:00 explain a bit more as does this link : Wisconsin Gov . < PROPMALE > Ginned Up Budget Shortfall To Undercut Worker Rights on TPMDC further down on mine . Seems like a bit of hanky panky going on and spin like a whirling dervish ! Is it not just too coincidental that the same thing is happening in other states in the same way ? Conspiracy Theory anyone ? ;-)
