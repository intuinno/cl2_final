I am incredibly shy around people I love . Otherwise I'd say something meaningful here . =P 

Lol .... I'm the First Doctor . I'm also really 28 years old and < PROPFIRST > from LOST . * Sigh * I don't like < PROPFIRST > very much . He annoys me . 
I believe ... 
I danced with a ninja at the dinner table because someone offered me 1,000,000 dollars :) 
Creationists and Evolutionists believe Intelligent Design is limited to the age of the world and what humans originated from . I believe God laughs at both of them because He has no such limits . 
is reading the Book of Jubilees :) . I find the Lost Books of the Bible worth reading . They shed fresh light on old Bible stories and sometimes flesh them out or better explain things . 
I've been shoulder pain free for 6 months now * does a dance * 
dreams of world domination and becoming President of the United States ( not at the same time ) . So ... what do YOU dream about ? 
Today , my rat Yum-Yum died . She has been suffering from a massive tumor on her belly , and today my sister and my Mom took her to the vet to have it removed . We ended up having to put her down . :( 
I just saw a documentary on dormant genes . It was both awesome and creepy . Especially the part about bird embryos . Creeeeeepy .... 
I'm cold . And I'm tired . And hungry .... Good morning ~ ! 
Sweet wild child chirping/ < PROPFEMALE > slow with heaven's wings/ and sail bright starry seas . 
is writing a Naruto x Sakura fanfic starring the two as a pair of roses on a windowsill . 0__0 Outrageous alternate universe fics ftw ! XD 
Cheesy noodles is cheesy . :) 
Snow makes me sooo happy ... ^_^ 
When I tried the low-carb diet for a second time , I decided if I ever lived to move out I would become a vegetarian , or better yet , vegan and swear off the nasty food altogether . I still have two vegan food sites in the ' My Stuff ' bookmark folder from that time . I'm on a diet again , but this time I'm counting calories , and the word calory diet has never sounded tastier . 
My stomach has been acting up today . I don't feel very good ... :( 
My diet has been going well so far . More vegetables and more real meals instead of quick snacks and microwaveables . 
Today , I ate two boiled eggs and a taco salad , and later I will have some meatloaf . No exercise today though ... :( 
FINALLY !! This site took a long time to load ... Anyways , I lost 5 lbs ^_^ . I feel a little down ... :( 
I've been having really weird cravings lately . If there was any way I could be pregnant , I'd think I was . 
I have a hard time explaining why I believe in the things I do ... Not because my beliefs are laughable even to me , but because words fail me . 
Nothing like bringing up an old crack theory about a popular character in a popular series and finding out people like it and you don't have a link to a published version of the theory . O__O 
It's the Chinese New Year's today . Oh yeah , and < PROPFIRST>'s Day :) 
< PROPFEMALE > still hasn't been able to get Facebook ... She e-mailed them twice to get it back up , but it isn't working ... :( 
I feel so depressed ... I got up because I felt melancholy ... But it seems all I can do is cry ... 
Stupid facebook ... it wants < PROPFEMALE > to send ID because apparently they think she is pretending to be someone else . Ugh . This family is getting off Facebook . 
< PROPFEMALE > and I got our driver permits ! Finally !!! 
< PROPFEMALE > is 24 today ! 8-D 
Today I drove around the apartment five times , took a walk , and bought a new cookbook , a diary and sugar-free gum . At the checkout counter , I told the cashier that if I went over the limit I'll put something back because I only had 20 dollars . Turns out I had 50 dollars . Happy day ! 
So tired ... achy ... my ankle hurts and both shoulder nerves are pinching today .... But I have to keep practicing ... On a positive note , my stomach is shrinking . 
Spam spam spam spam spam .... ugh .... spam ... 
Bought smoked Gruyère cheese , 4 quail , and cinnamon raisin bread . Cheese is SCRUM-DIDDLY-UMPTIOUS !! 8D Can't wait to try the quail . I'm going to cook them later today . Yum ! 
I'm cooking the quail . :) I've never had quail before , and I get to make it too ! 
It tastes and smells like beef xD Totally unexpected . And with a hint of seafood . 
My last post was eaten by FB .... O_o . Anyway , I hurt my toe pretty bad , so I skipped walking and driving today . Oww .... 
Yay ! I get to see special old friends tomorrow ! * runs around ( inside ) like a dog hearing the ' W ' word ... only this time , it's an ' H ' word * 
I miss my smoked Gruyère cheese . It was really good . I had a few sandwiches with it and read that it also melts well . Never melted it . * sigh * I liked my smoked Gruyère cheese ... Maybe next time I go to the store , I'll buy --- OMG ! WHERE'S MY WALLET ?! 
I'm SO addicted to games right now . Also enjoying a Manwha ( Korean manga ) about a girl who hides aliens from outer space in her house . Found my wallet soon after writing my last status update , btw . 
Really enjoying the Lost Books of the Bible and the Apocrypha right now :) . 
Poof ! 
Okay ... the First Book of < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > went out to lunch . Seriously , reproduction and marriage coming from the devil ? That's really ... stretching it , considering God's commandments to < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > in < PROPFEMALE > . 
I haven't written anything in ages . I'm in the mood for writing a story with a lot of action in it , but I can't seem to pull my scattered thoughts together to produce a story . 
I got out of my action mood and now I'm in more of a comedy mood . Argh ... I can't stay in one mood long enough to work on even a one-shot ... I'm starving . Gotta go eat ! 
Rats smell like puppies ? 
This week is awesome ! South Park had an EPIC episode , Naruto had an ENJOYABLE chapter , the new Doctor Who episode FINALLY came out , and today is Dad's BIRTHDAY . Yaaaaaay ! ? ? ? 
And I hurt my toe . Again . Feels like it just got better . Now I'm back to nursing it . * Sigh * 
I really hate the new outlook for the FB profile . It's terrible ! Instead of Death Note , they put it as Death Notice ! Wtf is Death Notice ?! And they added some weird crap that I've only managed to clear out . Ugh ! 
Mom's watching Doctor Who ! * jumps up and down * Yay , finally someone in my family knows what I'm talking about ! 
Bad weather here , but I keep wanting to say what I think about Cowardly Comedy Central . ... What do you know , I just did . Hope we don't see any tornadoes ... 
I hate series where the hero acts hypocritically , endangering 1000s , and other characters are made out to be insane , dark , or stupid whenever they point this obvious fact out ... D-: It makes me think of propaganda in real life :( 
I love StumbleUpon ... Right now I'm looking at sites about UFOs . :) 
So tired ... I HATE my profile pic . And constant griping about politics . But mostly my profile pic . * sigh * Stupid pic ... 
Wow , the internet was down a whole day ... Grandma fell again , so Mom and < PROPFEMALE > left to go help her . So , I've been alone all day . I can't even find the cat :( 
Depressed . Really depressed ... :( 
Lady Coco is a BOY =O 
< PROPFEMALE > will be gone this weekend , so we'll be taking care of her rats and cat while she's away . =D 
I'm renovating my bedroom . Turns out I have a collection of diaries , journals , and spiritual walk diaries I haven't used much at all . 
I must have school fever ... Today I've been looking up all kinds of colleges and universities while on my break . Huh . 
* sigh * typing with one hand is so slow ... 
I\ 
just realized I could record stories using my ipod voice\ 
recorder ... As long as I can get over the barrier of annoying people\ 
with my voice and having to listen to myself , that would be awesome ! 
I really should get back to writing . Or at least voice record a fic . Hmm ... 
I recorded some of my poetry . :) 
My ipod froze !! D8 ... It'll get better once it runs out of batteries . ^_^ ... I hope D: 
Spoilers for the new Doctor Who finale ( first part ): D8 ' omgwtf!' 
finished recording almost all my own stories . Accidentally deleted the last 5 chaps I recorded of my novel though :( 
I hate it when tap water starts tasting bad and stops being refreshing ... Unlike with a water filter , you can't change the tap . * sigh * * gets drink mixes to cover up taste * . In other news , I feel oddly weepy today . 
Last night I dreamed of a cute fuzzy white slug on Mom's neck with the face of a rat , and an inquisitive lazy dinosaur hatchling with sparse red down on it's body whose mother was an ostrich , and cleaning up a poor dead frog . 
I LOVED the second part of the Doctor Who finale ! 8D <3<3<3 
It's 3:30 , I'm tired , I have a mild but irritating headache , tomorrow is church , and the neighbors partying outside are sooo LOUD . Don't they know when to SHUT UP so people can get some shut eye ?! 
Church went well :) . Very unique from what I'm used to . 
I just read a super cute romance fan-comic for Gaara/Hinata ( Naruto ) . I swear that's a ' caramel drizzled , sugar frosted , double dipped in chocolate cotton < PROPFEMALE>' couple . I have to take them in small doses to avoid mental diabetes . 
I got up . Even though it's 3:40 . Because I'm feeling sad . 
~ gLoOm ~ 
I don't feel like talking to anyone outside of my home today ... 
I feel better . Or rather felt better . I became sad again just now . * sigh * 
Fireworks !! 8D 
Beware of hoaxes . But beware of conspiracy theories also . 
Shu-Shu\ 
was SUPER cute today :) . When < PROPFEMALE > finished cleaning his cage , he\ 
jumped off the rat table onto the floor so he could scamper to her . \ 
Then he sniffed around the fresh cage , in the middle of the living\ 
room , and climbed happily inside . D'aww ... I ? rats :) 
Curse you , Eureka , and your doomed romances !! D8 Seriously , would it KILL them to have one happy couple ? 
Koko and Chibi got to visit each other's homes and check each other out . Koko was really good . I'm so proud of my little < PROPFEMALE > ^_^ 
I have a cold :( . But I'm back to writing ^_^ 
I think my power writing batteries are finally recharged from last winter . I wrote THIRTEEN fanfiction ficlets ( all well under 300 words long ) in three days ( that's actually not considered a lot , but for me it is ) . I hope it lasts longer than two months this time . 
Coco did so well at Chibi's apartment , and so did Chibi . I really do think it's only a matter of time before they become buddies 8D 
I wish I felt better :( 
Last night I had nightmares about poetry . I wish I wasn't so insecure about mine . 
Oh noes ! I got hives ! T_T 
know you're hungry when you watch Primeval and all you can think of is how you'd like fried giant centipede legs with a side order of mosasaurus fin soup . 
After eating , I thought I would stop thinking weird thoughts , so I watched the next two episodes , but couldn't stop thinking of roasted dodo and baked pterosaur . Thankfully , the parasite did not make me want creme a la parasite . 
Two reasons why you should never believe what you see on TV\ 
1 . TV Raptors : Pfft ! Doorknobs shnoorknobs . This is a piece of cake . \ 
2 . Real Raptors : I see shiny !! -attacks water reflection- 
hate the ' girls always fall for bad boys ' saying so much ... The definition of bad and nice in this case varies so much that it has absolutely no meaning ! Whoever coined it needs to be beaten with a\ 
spoon . Repeatedly . I hate that saying . 
Wu-Wu briefly stopped breathing today ;_; . He's fine now and moving about , but it seems he really is on his last legs . Poor little guy .... 
Well .... Wu-Wu is still alive . I'm still surprised . 
Well , I finally watched The Dark Knight . People sadly spoiled me completely on The Joker , but remarkably , I had no idea about anything else . It was very sad D8 . 
Coco is so fussy right now ! =O 
I saw\ 
a nameless picture of an actor . At first glance , \ 
I couldn't tell if it was < PROPMALE > Ford or < PROPFIRST > Eckhart ( The Dark Knight ; Harvey\ 
Dent ) . I finally figured out it was < PROPMALE > Ford . I don't know why I think they look at all similar ... O_o 
The cat was Awake and ... < PROPFEMALE > opened her cage ! Luckily , the cat didn't notice , so I just got some wire to seal the cage . But now I'm so jittery from that little scare that I decided to get up until I calm down a bit . 
I miss romances that end happily . I just thought this after watching the tenth show in a row where tragedy strikes right after their first kiss after a whole season ( or two ) of waiting/dreading ... 
' Arkham Asylum : A Serious House on Serious E < PROPMALE > h ' has beautiful < PROPMALE > , but is definitely not for the lighthe < PROPMALE > ed . It was rather depressing , confusing at p < PROPMALE > s , and insane . The end with Batman and Two-Face was made of win , though . 
Today we cleaned house for some guests we're expecting ^_^ 
Mmmm .... tea . 
I just finished the ' Dark Victory ' Batman arc , and it was awesome ! But now I am in desperate need of brain bleach . 
I like mysteries ... :) Mom rented some < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > audiobooks and Columbo DVDs from the library . -dances- 
hate it when I accidentally spoil a great movie ... Now I actually feel\ 
sick and embarrassed . I'm so sorry !! It was an awesome movie , despite\ 
its flaws and the rushed and poorly executed ending . It was still a\ 
great flick ! ;_; 
I feel like hugging things ... -hugs sister- <3 hugs cat- <3 -hugs computer- <3 
I dun feel too good ... :( 
I'm drawing chibi faces . I need to work on poses and hair , but it's a start . 
G'mornin ' ... ( ~ o ~ ) ~ zzZZ 
The bad part about reading a new story/comic/manga chapter/issue : First I was like ' D8 ... What ? No!' Then I discussed it with an online friend , and they were like ' AARGH!' and I was like ' AAUGH!' and then we were like ' Well , that sucked ... ' 
Oh ! And I forgot ... CHOCOLAAAAAAATE !!! ( and nuts ) 8D 8D 8D 
-sigh- ... I'd like a hug . I need a hug . I need more hugs . Hugs are good . 
No , I'm NOT depressed ! I've just been wanting more hugs than normal . When I'm depressed I hide in my room for a few hours . I don't like being around people when I'm down . Hugs require being around people , which requires not being depressed . 
Coco's so adorable when he's drinking . He's so noisy ! xD 
We just came home from a play-date with Chibi and Coco . Coco can't wait to do it again . ( > ^w^ < ) ~ Meow 
Happy Halloween , everyone ( at least those of you who celebrate it) ! <3 
Well , that was a new\ 
flavor of awkward I didn't know existed and I hope never to taste\ 
again . O___O ( Lol ! xD ) 
My reaction to a story : O_______O ... Well , that was a new flavor of Awkward I wasn't aware of , and I hope never to experience it again . 
Nothing like waking up to run in the bathroom to puke . -Sigh- And my cat had been meowing at me to wake up . Why couldn't I wake up to cuteness instead of sickiness ? >_< ( Guess I better burn toast ) 
Ugh ... I haven't written a story in ages . I feel bad . I haven't even written poetry in a couple of months ! Argh ... 
Ever had a day where you're just curling up to read something and no matter what , you find yourself reading something angsty , bittersweet , or downright depressing ? O___O ... Yesterday was like that for me . -Sigh- 
Eh , I'm bored . I feel like tossing papers in the air just because ! 
I'm finally getting my interest in psychology back . ^o^ <3 
Last night , Coco chased < PROPFEMALE > , one of our girl rats . She's fine though . 
Watching ' 1 Litre of Tears ' . I've seen it before . \ 
Definitely the saddest drama I've ever seen . Ironically , I'm now\ 
tearing up over Batman : Crime & Punishment . Even though I haven't\ 
read that one recently . Gahh ... 
( I don't normally do this ... ^^ ;) -- Change your FB profile picture to a cartoon from your childhood . The goal ? To not see a human face on FB till Monday , December 6th . Join the fight against child abuse & copy & paste this to your status to invite your friends to do the same . ^_^ 
* GLOOOOM * Ugh , I hate suicide in fiction .... * GLOOOOOM * 
I kinda want to keep this as my profile pic . I don't like my photos ... It's very distracting when I write on here and I have to look at myself . 
FB changed ? How annoying ... 
I've got bad news : both < PROPFEMALE > and Mr. Wiggles have tumors now :-( 
Brrrr ! It's so cold today that it's like Mr. Freeze escaped the insane asylum ! 
ACHOO !! > o<' 
Nothing is scarier than when a perpetually unhappy character is suddenly cheerful . Nothing . The first thing that pops into mind seeing that is \OMG ! IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD !! RUN FOR THE HILLS ! \ " But then you remember it's just a story and those frightening temporary mood shifts will cause no dire consequences . In reality anyway . Whew ! " 
[ Batman : Fighting crime can be so fun ! =)] \ 
Er ... Well , initial shock aside , this IS a nice change from his usual gloomy self . ^_^ ;\ 
\ 
-5 pages later- \ 
[ Two-Face : Everything is so wonderful !! =D ] \ 
O_O ........ What . 
Ow ... I think I burnt my tongue on my hot cocoa ! >,< Anyway , tomorrow we're finally putting up our Christmas tree =D 
< PROPFEMALE > CHRISTMAS !!! <3<3<3 
Every time someone tries to imply that Batman and Two-Face both have split personalities , I die a little inside from the sheer stupidity . A secret identity is an orchestrated lie to protect one's true identity that the person has full control over and created consciously . A split personality is a coping mechanism for severe trauma that a person creates subconsciously and has NO control over . 
DC : Vilifying Mental and Behavioral Disorders One Disease at a Time . * facepalm * 
< PROPFEMALE>'s not doing well . She was gasping for air last night and drooling . =( 
< PROPFEMALE > died . ='( 
Cold is emo . Just ask < PROPFEMALE > . 
Currently watching Mushi-Shi . It's so relaxing . :) 
Sexism took over a forum I used to enjoy . O= I mean REALLY took over . Right now there's a lot of posts joking about how women are only good for two things : housework and sex . D-: 
Ever read a published story written in such a way that you can guess what music the writer was listening to while writing ? I believe the writer of \Batman : Jekyll & Hyde\ " was listening to Linkin Park . 8-D " 
What a nightmare ! I dreamed hair was growing on the back of my throat ! I'm pretty sure Coco was in it , and dinosaurs , and < PROPMALE > Grayson ( Batman's 1st < PROPFIRST > ) , and Two-Face . Coco , dinosaurs , and supervillains are welcome anytime , but < PROPMALE>'s views on mental illness make my blood run cold and hair growing on the back of the throat is ... * shiver * 
* sigh * I really miss < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > , the original Batman . < PROPMALE > Grayson is just ... ugh . Yeah , threaten a nonviolent insane man who can't comprehend what death is and isn't actually trying to cause problems with violence . THAT is sure to set him straight . * bangs head on wall repeatedly * 
Wow . I stumbled on a video about DID . A lot of the comments on both the video and on each other were really idiotic and mean . \Fake ! \ " \ " I thought other personalities aren't aware of each other ...? \ " \ " You can't have been traumatized by your parents ' divorce as a child ! \ " \ " Tell your abusive parents to stop ( lolwut)\ " and blah blah \ " Jekyll and Hyde\ " (* bangs head on keyboard *) . The idiocy is toxic level ! " 
I ... do not have article writing skills . >_< On the other hand , I'm currently working on a re-write of my crappy first novel . Not saying anything , but I'm really excited about it . =D 
Bleagh , I have a cold and feel like my head will explode . 
Schumacher's logic in Batman Forever : witty , greedy narcissists with a love for riddles are very similar to stock over-the-top < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > performances and depressed , angry suicidal psychopaths are much like easily amused evil clowns . 
My cold is much better :) . Unfortunately , my voice is still almost completely muted due to my larynx being infected :( . 
Hellooooo ^_^ . Remember how I said I missed < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > as Batman because he didn't say weird things about the mentally ill despite fighting a bunch of criminally insane villains ? Well , I just read \Two-Face : Crime & Punishment\ " and re-read \ " The Killing Joke\ " . And now I take back everything I said about < PROPMALE > then . I take it ALL back . Three words : \ " DO NOT WANT . \ " D-8 " 
I just realized one of the secondary characters of the novel I wrote years ago carried a lucky coin he'd sometimes flip . * Bangs head on desk * I ... don't really know how to react to that . It doesn't sound like a trait I'd give one of my novel characters ; I was sure I'd written him with a habit that fitted in the world I created . Like fidgeting with a pocket knife . Nope . He was a coin tosser . * Bangs head on desk * 
Arrrgh ! I'm so sick of this cold ! It's like I'm over it , but I'm still coughing and blowing my nose every other hour -- and my voice is still gone ! * Eats keyboard in frustration * 
Bow ties are cool . :-) 
I finally was well enough to go to church today . =D
