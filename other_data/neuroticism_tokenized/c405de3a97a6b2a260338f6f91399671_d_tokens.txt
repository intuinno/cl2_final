\See everything ; overlook a great deal ; correct a little . \ " -Pope < PROPFIRST > XXIII\ 

You can tell more about a person by what he says about others than you can by what others say about him . 
When you invite trouble , it's always quick to accept . 
Fear less , hope more ; eat less , chew more ; whine less , breathe more ; talk less , say more ; hate less , love more ; and all good things are yours . 
Giving up doesn't always mean that you're weak . Sometimes it means that you are strong enough to know when to let go . 
The conscience is God's voice manifested in human nature in our hearts and minds -- our deepest guide . Rightness , of the decisions we make now , will be born in the future . We must engage our conscience in order to live an engaging life . 
If you compare yourself with others , you may become vain and bitter ; for there will always be persons greater and lesser than yourself . 
I love it when my Mom calls me baby girl ... it's my favorite :) 
An idle mind is the Devil's workshop , and idle hands are the Devil's tools 
Sushi dinner floating by on boats with some sake bombs to top it off , sounds like a good night in the making :) 
WE FOUND MOO-MOO ! A lady dropped him off at the Humane Society , and since we were there yesterday and gave them a flier they recognized him and contacted us immediately . He is like our child and we are happy to have him home safe and sound . Thank you all SO MUCH for your help and loving support .
