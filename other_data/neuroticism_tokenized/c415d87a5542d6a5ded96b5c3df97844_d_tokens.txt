Computer is fixed . :D New video card . w000000t 

New account , fresh start . xD 
As long as the twilight veils\ 
\ 
The decadence we embrace\ 
More than the ones we love\ 
We're ardent , we're burning down ... \ 
Not afraid of crying , sorrow and foe\ 
Not afraid of falling down below\ 
To the night , recklessly we fly\ 
Like living dead , we'll never die ! 
Living after midnight , rocking to the dawn ! \ 
Loving till the morning , then I'm gone .. I'm gone ! 
Review web for history makes absolutely no sense . o_O T.T 
I was born in ashes of molten hatred\ 
Raised by the demons in abodes of the end\ 
The reaper's scythe I fall upon to light my path\ 
Wrecked by mangled wounds of life I have become\ 
The resurrection of the evil one\ 
Y'know that I don't ******* care If I live or die\ 
I need a bishop preaching fire to get away with my sins\ 
I despise everything I see\ 
Anyone who knows the name of this song gets a cookie . :D 
One long day of school .. and one long contemplative walk home 
Devildriver's Beast beast coming out in Feburary , Children of Bodom's Relentless Reckless Forever in March . It's gonna be a good start of the year for Melodic Death Metal ! _|m||m|_

Anyone else stay up for the lunar eclipse ? Couldn't see much of anything . Stupid clouds . Oh well , it was a beautiful night anyway . Maybe I can survive the 372 years to see it again . xD 
800x600 screen resolution is WAY too small for a 19\ widescreen monitor . Need to fix my graphics drivers and soon .. "

Tired .... must sleep . No ! Must clean the useless junk on my computer .. then sleep . 
\The < PROPFEMALE > that shines the brightest is all the more glorious for its brevity ... \"" 
Sick ? Allergies ? Who knows anymore ? Thinking about it just makes me reeaally tired . 
While you scream at your woman , there's a man wishing he could whisper in her ear . While you humiliate , offend , and insult her , there's a man flirting with her and reminding her how beautiful she is . While you hurt her , there's a man wishing he could take her pain away . While you make her cry , there's a man stealing smiles from her . Post this on your wall if you are against Domestic Violence & Mental Abuse

I just hate it when random women from Switzerland add you .. but then try to scam you into signing up for an adult website . Swedish women would never do that ... Unless the website was for their personal modeling photos . ^_^ But , now I'm just beginning to ramble . 
Watching foreign horror films . Woot , go Germany ! 
Just had an epic battle with my keyboards .. I can thank my highly analytical mind for the solution to a very perplexing problem . =] 
Thanks for the wonderful birthday , everyone ! 
Beautiful morning . :)

Swings - Man's gift to the weary mind . 
I think I just managed to sneeze with one eye open . O.o 
My sis and I just got finished burying the cat that was left in our front yard this morning . Rest in peace , you beautiful creature . 
When one door of happiness closes , another opens , but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one that has been opened for us . - < PROPFEMALE > Keller 
Your batteries are fine ! Stupid wireless mouse . You've been telling me to replace them for a week now ! You're fine !
