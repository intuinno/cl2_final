Hell must be freezing over . I'm in bed before one again and on top of that I'm sober . WOW five nights in a row . That's a new record for me since moving back down to the valley . I guess it's time to move someplace else just gotten bored with the night life in the valley . 
Time to get my lazy butt up and get into the new office to clean it up so that we can be ready to go tomorrow . 
Ten mile bike ride , an hour at the gym , 20 pack of < PROPMALE > light , and back at the office . Sad life of a single man with nothing else to do .

Such a simple song but a good one . 
Haven't had a drink in three days . Dam Spurs couldn't pull off at least one win for me to have at least an excuse . 
These days there's dudes getting facials\ 
Manicured , waxed and botoxed\ 
With deep spray-on tans and creamy lotiony hands\ 
You can't grip a tacklebox\ 
Well with all of these men lining up to get neutered\ 
It's hip now to be feminized\ 
I don't highlight my hair\ 
I've still got a pair\ 
Yeah < PROPFEMALE > , I'm still a guy\ 
Oh my eyebrows ain't plucked\ 
There's a gun in my truck\ 
Oh thank God , I'm still a guy

Down to 199 . Under 200 for first time in a year . Starting to loose that body fat . My goal is 185 . I'm still eating what I want and drinking what I want when I want . 
The road goes on forever and the party never ends . 
At the < PROPMALE > yokum concert . 
Well I'm not first class but I'm not white trash . I'm wild and a little crazy too . Some girls don't like boys like me but ahh some girls do . 
It is absolutely miserable outside . Give me vegas dryness and heat over humidity any time . 
Nice an ambulance missed its turn and is now reversing to turn . Nice . And now they stopped and the emergency doors are stuck . He had to kick it to get it open . Wow . 
Been up for an hour and can't go work out cuz of this dam neck pain . But there are no stores open to go by some meds . Another knock against the valley . 
At < PROPMALE>'s having a cerveza . 
Moving forwards , using all my breath\ 
Making love to you was never second best\ 
I saw the world crashing all around your face\ 
Never really knowing it was always mesh and lace\ 
I'll stop the world and melt with you\ 
You've seen the difference and it's getting better all the time\ 
There's nothing you and I won't do\ 
I'll stop the world and melt with you 
Gym , 17 mile bike ride and then time to get plastered . Let the weekend begin .

What happened last night ? 
At a bar down in < PROPFIRST > an old man chimed in\ 
And they thought he was out of his head\ 
And all being a young man they just laughed it off\ 
When they heard what this old man he said\ 
He said I'll never again turn the young ladies headds\ 
Or go running off in to the wind\ 
I'm three quarters home from the start to the end\ 
And I wish I was eighteen again 
This isn't good . Just realized that I have drank every single day since last thursday . Half of those nights I can't remember . 
To the pool or the bar ? 
Just benched 265 . 40 pounds away from my all time < PROPMALE > . I'm getting there . 
Time for a swim . 
I thinks its time for a camping trip to the island for some night fishing . Two cases of beer , bread , ham , fishing pole , and tent . Good to go . As long as a shark or drug dealers don't get me . 
Laziness almost conquered but still got up for my morning swim . Let's see if I get my bike ride and workout in . 
Gym workout done . Bike ride in two hours . 
20 mile bike ride and now for the game . Go celtics !!! 
Two ugly reps on bench at 275 but hey no spotter . Getting closer to my all time < PROPMALE > . 
Ahh a more friendly weight of 245 . Nothing else to do between sets . 
What to have for lunch ? 
Hitting the pool to do laps . 
Off to bed . Need to wake up at 5 to get a swim and ab workout in . 
Women are just as bad as men . I'm sitting here having a beer and watching them take off their wedding rings . This world that we live in has become so sad . Fyi they are not taking them off for me as far as I know . 
Five loads of laundry all done in an hour and a half . I love laundry mats such time savers . 
City of McAllen amazes me again . They have moved the Fourth of July celebrations to the third of July just because the fourth falls on a Sunday . I don't know but correct me if I'm wrong but I think this national holiday is called the FOURTH OF JULY FOR A REASON !!!!!! 
Just ate a large pizza and don't feel guilty about it . 
Off to the court house and then gym . 
I don't get it . I eat a lot of bad food and drink a lot . My workouts are terrible and I lose five pounds . Oh well , wing stop for dinner . 
I think god or the devil is trying to tell me something . For the second time I pay for something and I get nothing but a lot of singles back in change . Hmmmmm . 
Sitting on the porch watching the storm and drinking some cervezas . 
Just saw an airplane take off . I guess its not that bad . 
I will be somewhere down in Texas if your looking for me . 
Up In The Air is a good movie . I relate to it so much . But its not for everyone . 
Almost time to hit the gym . I think I will get a haircut today finally after a couple of months of letting it grow out . I'm thinking maybe to shave it . 
The City of McAllen is proud to announce the lineup of its 82ND Annual Independence Day Celebration presented by Holanda Fruttare . All Independence Day festivities will be held on Saturday , July 3rd . A lot of people still don't know about this .

I think tonight is a movie night . Time to go see Grown Ups .

Ok I did it . I shaved my head . Nah . I look bad enough with hair and without it , oh boy . Been there done that . But I did cut a lot of hair off . 
On my way to watch grown ups . 
Now I know I'm getting old . They re-made TRON . That was a bad ass movie when I was a kid . 
In the famous words of my family and friends . Its time to get house drunk . 
I think the modern world makes life harder rather than easier . 
Three and a half weeks until the < PROPMALE > Paisley H2O tour . Let's see if I can hold out from drinking until then . I doubt it . 
If you resolve to give up smoking , drinking and loving , you don't actually live longer ; it just seems longer . < PROPMALE > Freud 
20 mile bike ride now for a shower and a chicken breast . Then call it a night . 
Dam cravings . Just got baskin robbins . Its my bros fault for talking about it the other day and my ex's fault for what I got . A banana < PROPMALE > . 
Why am I not allowed to shoot people ? I picked the wrong week to stop drinking . 
An hour at the gym and then a 21 mile bike ride . How should I reward myself ? Oooo a healthy choice tv dinner . Whoo hoo . 
Marriage is a great institution , but I'm not ready for an institution yet . -- < PROPFEMALE > West 
They should have named you Cocaine . Cuz your all in my brain driving me insane . 
People who think they know everything are a great annoyance to those of us who do . 
At the gym . 
To often , we lose sight of lifes simple pleasures . Remember , when someone annoys you it takes 42 muscles in your face to frown , BUT , it only takes 4 muscles to extend your arm and bitch-slap that mother .... upside the head . 
Up at 4:30 to workout . Work all day and then workout again at 5 . Then top that off with a 17 mile bike ride . Then my dam car is f'd up and I have to have it taken to the shop tomorrow . Oh well , time for bed and do it all again tomorrow .

Time for a turbo at wana wana's .

F the reporters . Let farve make money . It is a capitalist society that we live in . 
Why do women hate the men that they lust for ? 
I'm ready for the < PROPMALE > Paisley H2O concert . Going to head over there around 3ish . 
< PROPMALE > is singing hootie . I love it . 
Hootie singing purple rain . Nice . 
Concert was great . Good friends good times . 
Finally feeling normal again . Two days of drinking and starting on my third . Amazing how a beer will make you feel good . 
time to lay out by the pool before watching the game . 
I move on like a sinners prayer \ 
I let go like a levee breaks \ 
Walk away as if I don't care \ 
Learn to shoulder my mistakes \ 
I'm built to fade like your favorite song \

Boy we really screwed up 90 years ago . What were we thinking of giving women the right to vote ? Oh well we could have elected an ultra liberal black president with a muslim name . Whoops did that too . Have we elected an ultra conservative white president who will get us involved in a never ending war ? Dam too late for that . Oh well were screwed time for a drink and forget any of that has happend . 
Progresso bound . 
I hate when people with big ass orders use drive thru's . 
Off to gym and then back to studying . 
Puff puff , give . Puff puff , give . You f**kin ' up the rotation . 
Still kinda drunk and working on a saturday . 
When you choke a smurf , what color does it turn ? 
So good to be single . No one to answer to or worry about . I can sit here and drink my coffee in peace and quite . 
Off to the District to kick off the new year of football . 
Ok I think a guy was checking me out at the gym . Oh well at least someone is . 
Only in the valley will you run into people who have never heard of < PROPMALE > armstrong . Really ? 
Where's the place to be for the games tonight ?

Ok . I have never ever gotten over the man hands episode of seinfeld . Thanks to that show I always look at a girls hands . 
And I'd give up forever to touch you \ 
Cause I know that you feel me somehow \ 
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be \ 
And I don't want to go home right now \ 
And all I can taste is this moment \ 
And all I can breathe is your life \ 
Cause sooner or later it's over \

Tired but off to the gym . 
Any one know of a good bank ? Been dealing with IBC and they are terrible . Every thing that I ask them to do has to be done at least two - four times . Nothing ever gets done right the first time and I mean nothing . 
I need a pain killer . Aka beer . My arm is in terrible pain . Over stretched my \

Off to church . That's the gym for me . 
Done with church and now for some meditation at starbucks to reflect on the past weeks events and focus on the week ahead . Especially in fantasy football . 
Only in the valley do you go to a sports bar and they turn off the game to play music . 
For some odd reason I don't think its illegal for a minor to sit at a bar in texas but it should be . I know it is in < PROPFEMALE > . Especially when its an 8 year old playing poker on one of those video machines . 
Ok . This a very interesting night . just saw the bartender scratching the back of his head with a glass . Then used it to serve a drink . 
Out having a drink . 
When I drink alone I prefer to be by myself . 
Ok just took a piss . I'm the only one who washed his hands . Really ? Wow ? 
Women in politics in the valley . Shocking there is a lot considering how chauvinistic the area is . I like it and applaud it . 
Life is too precious to worry about stupid things . \ 
So have fun , get drunk , and fall in love . \

At the gym . Time to see how close I am to my goal . 
I did 225 22 times . 3 away from my goal . Amazing what eating breakfast does for my body . Of course the chili dog and burrito from mega chicken didn't help but sure didn't hurt . 
Studying and listening to Mozart . 
Desperado , \ 
Ohhhh you aint getting no younger . \ 
Your pain and your hunger , \ 
They're driving you home . \ 
And freedom , ohh freedom . \ 
Well that's just some people talking . \ 
Your prison is walking through this world all alone . \ 
Don't your feet get cold in the winter time ? \ 
The sky won't snow and the sun will shine . \ 
It's hard to tell the night time from the day . \ 
And you're losing all your highs and lows 
So I flip that middle finger and the index finger follow\ 
DEUCES 
Never , under any circumstances , take a sleeping pill and a laxative on the same night . 
During sex , my girlfriend always wants to talk to me . Just the other night she called me from a hotel . 
Ok so I have approx 50 dollars all in ones . What should I do ? What would I do when I was in the NAVY ? Hmmmm . 
Pretty good day today . Work , Golf , Gym , and then home to study . Looking forward to Saturday for Bicentennials Grand Opening Party !!!! 
The average woman kisses 29 men before she gets married . What do you women think of that ? High or in my opinion low ? And what's the average for men kissing women ? 
Now I just answered a poll for Best place to find a quality date ? 14%Office , \ 
10%Bar , \ 
31%Church , \ 
12%Online , and \ 
32%Other . LOL I choose other . Meaning there is no place . Of course the bar is the worst place and the day I step into a church ...... well lets just say that's not going to happen . 
Haven't had a drink since last saturday . I've lost four pounds and in a really good mood . God I need a drink . 
< PROPMALE > Burgundy : I love scotch . Scotchy , scotch , scotch . Here it goes down , down into my belly ... 
Gym time and then dinner . Bicentennials is where I will be if I go out . Definitely tomorrow night for the grand opening . 
Girl , you'll be a woman ... soon\ 
I love you so much , can't count all the ways\ 
I've died for you girl and all they can say is\ 
\He's not your kind\ " \ 
My ears are burning . I feel so special . 
Too much to say about tonight . 
Still wearing shorts but did upgrade to tennis shoes instead of sandals . Oh well , starchizzle time . 
I feel I've come of age\ 
When she peeks I start to run\ 
You can't swallow what I'm thinkin\ 
I run through the world thinkin ' ' bout tomorrow , thinkin ' ' bout tomorrow\ 
I am smellin like the rose\ 
that somebody gave me on\ 
my birthday deathbed\ 
I am smellin ' like the rose\ 
that somebody gave me\ 
cause I'm dead & bloated 
Time to start getting ready . Go get some dinner on and then out to Bicentennials for the grand opening party . I'm just going to apologize in advance for my behavior tonight . Also , not responsible what may be posted later . 
At The Patio for dinner . 
Two men are out just fishing quietly and drinking beer . \ 
Almost silently , so as not to scare the fish , < PROPMALE > says , ' I think I'm gonna divorce my wife . She hasn't spoken to me in over 2 months . ' \ 
< PROPMALE > continues slowly sipping his beer then thoughtfully says , \ 
' You better think that one over , < PROPMALE > . Women like that are hard to find . 
I am just a new boy \ 
Stranger in this town \ 
Where are all the good times ? \ 
Who's gonna show this stranger around ? \ 
Ooooo I need a dirty woman \ 
Ooooo I need a dirty girl \ 
Will some woman in this desert land \ 
Make me feel like a real man ? \ 
Take this rock n roll refugee \ 
Ooo Babe , set me free \ 
Ooooo I need a dirty girl 
Time to go to the gym and run off my stress . 
Just got done jogging 8.5 < PROPMALE > . Longest I've ever ran with out the police chasing me . I must have a lot of stress . 
\Solitude is the profoundest fact of the human condition . Man is the only being who knows he is alone . \ " < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > " 
At starbucks trying out one of those spinach-feta wraps . Coffee at this location is never hot enough . 
It's been a while \ 
since i could say that i wasn't addicted and \ 
Since I could say I love myself as well and \ 
Since I've gone and f***ed things up just like i always do \ 
But all that sh*t seems to disappear when i'm with you \ 
But everything I can't remember as f***ed up as it may seem \ 
the consequences that I've rendered \ 
I've gone and f***ed things up again 
Having coffee again this morning and eating huevos rancheros . Its good to be < PROPMALE > in my nation of one .

Just watched a cialas commercial and now I want to go camping and take a hot bath .

answer ... is , \What .. does a woman want ? '' -- Freud " 
Bachelors should be heavily taxed . It is not fair that some men should be happier than others . - < PROPFIRST > Wilde 
Ready to hit the gym and work chest then a 5 mile run . Maybe on the run . Then off to buffalo wild wings for monday night football . 
I can go out every night of the week\ 
Can go home with anybody I meet\ 
But it's just a temporary high ' cause when I close my eyes\ 
I'm somewhere with you , somewhere with you\ 
If you see me out on the town\ 
And it looks like I'm burning it down\ 
You won't ask and I won't say\ 
But in my heart I'm always somewhere with you\ 
My new favorite < PROPMALE > Chesney song \Somewhere with you . \"" 
You got a body like the devil and you smell like sex\ 
I can tell you're trouble but I'm still obsessed \ 
Because you know you're\ 
So hot I wanna get you alone\ 
So hot I wanna get you stoned\ 
So hot I don't wanna be your friend\ 
I wanna **** you like I'm never gonna see you again \ 
Yeaa\ 
Come on\ 
Yea \ 
You're like the kiss of death , like the hand of faith\ 
I can tell you're trouble but I still wanna taste 
Once again it's that time of the day . Gym Time and then veg time . 
Ok 25 in a 45 is not acceptable people . Get your asses moving . There is no one in front of you . Being old is not an excuse . 
Reebok easy tone shoe commercial is my new fav . 
Wants to go back to hawaii !!! 
Ok time to separate the men from the boys . Dammit I got stuck in the boys section again . 
How many mexican food restaurants can one town have ? The old woodlands is now going to be panchos . 
Why am I the bad guy even when I'm the good guy ? 
So say good night to the bad guy ! Come on . The last time you gonna see a bad guy like this again , let me tell you . Come on . Make way for the bad guy . There's a bad guy comin ' through ! Better get outta his way !

I held a moment in my hand , brilliant as a < PROPFEMALE > , fragile as a flower , a < PROPFEMALE > sliver of one hour . I dripped it carelessly , Ah ! I didn't know , I held opportunity . ~ Hazel < PROPFIRST > 
Time to go see my gym girlfriends . 
Working out back today . Saw a couple of new ponies yesterday that may need to be added to the stable . 
Just noticed that I have a nice six pack starting to show .... I guess that's what happens when you drink six beers from a twelve pack . 
off to the gym . how many < PROPMALE > shall I run today ? 
Just ate my first hershey chocolate bar in almost three years . Just like a kid dessert before dinner . 
Sleep - the most beautiful experience in life - except drink . \ 
W . C . Fields 
Happy Hour or Gym ? What to do ? This is about as complicated as my life gets . Its soooooo nice . 
I think I like soccer now . They just showed a female fan flashing on tv . 
What happened to the days of writing telephone < PROPFIRST > on napkins ? 
Definitely happy hour today !!! Peppers here I come . 
So , is it wrong of me to get a married woman's number ? I'm not married . 
if I had two dozen roses and an old bottle of wine . would that change your mind ? 
Finally made it to the gym . 
Gym time . some day I may actually workout when I go . 
I'm not going to change the way I look or the way I feel to conform to anything . I've always been a freak . So I've been a freak all my life and I have to live with that , you know . I'm one of those people . \

Do you know what it means to come home at night to a woman who'll give you a little love , a little affection , a little tenderness ? It means you're in the wrong house . \ 
< PROPFIRST > Burns 
Hmm single is where I am and where I think I will stay . I'm actually happy with it . Nope . After taking a look around me I'm very happy with it . 
Another thing I noticed is either A I don't have enough tattoos or B I don't have enough of the bad boy personality . 
\He who knows others is wise . He who knows himself is enlightened . \ " - Lao Tzu " 
A man can be happy with any woman as long as he does not love her . \ 
There's this place in me where your fingerprints still rest , your kisses still linger , and your whispers softly < PROPFEMALE > . It's the place where a part of you will forever be a part of me . < PROPFEMALE > Kemp\ 
Read it and just like the sound of it . 
Gym , sushi or home ? Such a tough decision to make . hmm 
So , who is going to get up and watch the lunar eclipse tonight ? 
Still up and going . 
Ahh first beer of the day is down . 
Just opened my mail and I am scheduled to go get lab work done on Feb 7th . Hell no not the day after the super bowl . Got to reschedule that appt . 
Lunch ? 
Christmas is a necessity . There has to be at least one day of the year to remind us that we're here for something else besides ourselves . ~ Eric Sevareid 
It is very distracting when a good looking girl is doing bent over rows right in front of you at the gym . Concentrate !!! On what ? 
Wish me luck !!! I'm about to eat a TV dinner that says best if used by < PROPFIRST > 2010 . A year old TV dinner . Sweet . 
Just attempted to eat at < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE>'s on north 10th . Absolutely terrible . Cold soup . Cold sandwich and old fries . So basically water and bread for lunch . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > you SUCK !!!!!! You cost me my fantasy football championship . Of course a couple of players contributed . But you were my final player to play today and you got me a big 0 points . F***ing second place . If your not first your last . 
What a way to start the new year . I've only have had one drink since 12:00 am 1/1/11 . Very uncharacteristic of me . Oh well . Here's to new beginnings . 
Back in the gym after a week off . I can definitely tell a lot of people are up to their no good new years resolutions . But good luck to them all . 
People when are you going to learn its not about making some made up promise to yourself . Its about a lifestyle change . 
You're like the drug that I can't stop taking\ 
I want more and I can't stop craving\ 
I still want you it's easy to see\ 
But guess what < PROPFEMALE > your not that good for me 
Watching money never sleeps as I fall asleep . 
Working out legs for the first time in six months . Not going to be in a good mood tomorrow . 
The woman anchoring nightline is really annoying . Well enough of depressing news . Say good night < PROPMALE > . Good night < PROPMALE > . 
Evil ways !!!

Watching my favorite mtv station padilla as loud as I want . 30 seconds to mars . 
Loud music , a beer , and shooting some pool . Good workout before bed . 
Only able to do 275 3 times . Feeling weak . Oh well , 40 pounds off of what I want to achieve . 
Ahhhh rather simple dinner . Two ahi tuna steaks and fresh green beans . Loved it . 
Finally met the woman of my dreams ..... And then I woke up . 
At the barber shop and about to chop my hair off !!! 
Language ... has created the word \loneliness\ " to express the pain of being alone . \ 
Need a beer . Who's in ? 
Too funny at Rio hotel . 
Insurance is like marriage . You pay , pay , pay and you never get anything back . - < PROPMALE > Bundy

HOLY SHIT !!! 
YESSSSSS !!!! 
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT !!!

Classic . Just heard on the radio from a 9 year study that diet drinks increase your risk of vascular disease by 61% . Just saw an ad on facebook that Diet Coke is promoting February in American Heart Month . Coincidence ?

Not a parent but just a hunch that kids who appear to be already on a sugar high shouldn't be eating donuts at 9 PM . 
Watching the Maltese Falcon . All the smoking in the movie makes me want to buy a pack of cigarettes and become a detective . 
What is this ? < PROPFIRST > Spade \The stuff that dreams are made out of . \ " Classic line . " 
Watching Catholic Schoolgirls in Trouble and having a beer . LOL also , known as the Kentucky Fried Movie . Its a classic comedy . 
Where am I ? 
I think I'm going to do what every girl I say hi to says . Go for a hike . Anyone know of any good trails . Don't care to become part of some drug smuggling but if need be I'm game . 
Nice 4-5 mile hike . Now time to head home to get a drink and cook up some fajitas . 
Beer , < PROPMALE > Starks fresh pico , Zarah's sirloin fajita , more beer . I'm good to go . 
Do the people in charge of Borderfest realize that Hawaii is not another country ? Come on . Borderfest is about celebrating other countries cultures not our own country . 
Just woke up . That's what I get for going to sleep early . Try to fall back asleep or go to the gym ? 
Don't know why but little things are annoying me today . Like the cackle of some girls laugh and then women who wear shoes that are too small for their big ass feet . I'm drinking my coffee may be things will change . 
Another great start to a morning . Up at 6:30 to do a lite workout . Cook myself a big breakfast and then get my starbucks on my way to work and still in early . Let's see what the rest of the day has in store for me .

Sad start to my day and week but life moves on and so do I . 
At home and its tuna for lunch . What to make for dinner ? Pretty sad food and gym are my two passions in life right now . 
Only able to bench 275 6 reps . But oh well knocked out 20 reps at 225 afterwards . Of course the guy next to me had to do 305 to show me up . But I'm not here to compete against other guys . I'm just here to enjoy my life training . 
10 exercises 3 sets each all back in 40 mins . Good enough of a workout . Now for some arm curls . But what kind ? 
For lent I'm giving up women . Thank god I'm not catholic . 
Ok < PROPFEMALE > Nichols . Your hot but the new red hair is too much . 
Still in my workout clothes and hitting the bars .

Are they sure about the world ending in 2012 ? All my indications say 2011 . Didn't go out New Years , no woman on Valentines , not going out on St. Pattys day , and I'm really happy with it all and my life . Hmmm maybe hell is just freezing over . 
What a start to my friday morning . Woke up late , got pulled over for speeding but only got a warning , and didn't even have a drink yesterday . A ton of cops out this morning looking for morning after DWI's . The cop that pulled me over was in a hurry . 
Sweet get to watch the end of the horns basketball game .

Only 10 < PROPMALE > on the bike today . got a late start . Time for a shower and grub . Chicken or steak ? 
Men who don’t understand women fall into two groups : Bachelors and Husbands . 
How does a man show a woman that he is planning for the future ? He buys two cases of beer instead of one . 
I knew a man who gave up smoking , drinking , sex , and < PROPMALE > food . He was healthy right up to the time he killed himself . - < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE >

It takes a lot of work to wake up in the morning looking this sexy . HA no it doesn't . 
Come on nuggets kick the lakers ass . 
For now , I'm just going to < PROPFEMALE > out with these two smoking hotties and fly privately around the world . It might be lonely up here , but I sure like the view . - < PROPFIRST > Sheen 
I'm 0 for 3 with marriage - the scoreboard doesn't lie , never has . So what we all have is a marriage of the heart . To sully or contaminate or radically disrespect this union with a shameful contract is something that I will leave to the amateurs and the Bible grippers . - < PROPFIRST > Sheen 
I ate too much . Meatloaf and mashed potatoes . Ummm Ummm goooooodddddd . I love cooking .
