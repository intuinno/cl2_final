This past weekend was pretty eventful . We bought a real Christmas tree for the first Christmas celebrated in our new home . I get so excited when I think about all the ways in which I can decorate and all the sweet things I can cook . It's going to be great ! Also over the weekend , we got a Kenmore steam dryer which matches our Kenmore washer . I hope with it's addition we can give the iron a rest . LoL . 
On a random whim , I decided to get a spray tan before going to a concert with my < PROPMALE > in Atlanta tonight ! We'll be seeing Darkest Hour w/ Periphery and Veil of < PROPFEMALE > .
