1 Corinthians 13:4 -7 Love is patient and kind ; love does not envy or boast ; it is not \ 
arrogant or rude . It does not insist on its own way ; it is not irritable\ 
or resentful ; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing , but rejoices with the \ 
truth . Love bears all things , believes all things , hopes all things , \ 
endures all things .

Give , and you will receive . Your gift will return to you in full - pressed down , shaken together to make room for more , running over , and poured into your lap . The amount you give will determine the amount you get back . \

if you wanna be happy for the rest of your life , never make a pretty women your wife ! 
amateurs built the ark , professionals built the titanic 
You saw a shirt for $97 . You didn’t have the cash , so you borrowed $50 from your mum and $50 from your dad = $100 . You bought the shirt , and had $3 change . You gave your dad $1 and your mum $1 and kept the other $1 for yourself . Now you owe your mum $49 and your dad $49 . 49+49 = 98 + your $1 = 99 . Where is the missing $1 ? 
I see the paths your eyes wonder down , I wanna come too .. 
had a really great day yesterday at the beach ! and excited to spend some time praising God this morning ! 
living without your love , was like not ever living at all . 
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks , than I'll follow you into the dark . 
at the cross you beckon me , draw me gently to my knees , and I am , lost for words , so lost in love , I am sweetly broken , wholly surrendered . 
laughing at other people getting hurt is what separates us from animals .. 
People say I'm strange , does it make me a stranger \ 
That my best friend was born in a manger 
The more you look , the less you see , so close your eyes and start to breathe . 
please forgive me if I act a little strange , for I know not what I do . Feels lightning running through my veins , every time I look at you . 
Jesus let us come to know you , Let us see you face to face , Touch us , hold us , use us , mold us , Holy let us live in you\ 
Jesus draw us every nearer , Hold us in your loving arms , Wrap us in your gentle presence , And when the rain comes bring us home 
if a camera lens is a circle ... why are pictures square o_O

Before a heartache can ever touch my life , it has to go through Your hands . \ 
Abba , I belong to you ! 
i wanna be here and nowhere else\ 
rationing off bits of myself\ 
so i can crumble at your side 
you can choose to be anything you want to be , so we say you should be yourself . 
They say that \Time will heal\ " \
