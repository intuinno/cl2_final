CHEA ! ALL DONE ! 

The relief of giving up on something hard last only for a short period , but the greatness of success last forever

We are what we repeatedly do . Excellence , therefore , is not an act but a habit . 
Take calculated risks . That is quite different from being rash . 
HAPPY NEW YEAR :D 
Glue can't fix everything 
S.S.D.D. -_- 
Lord knows that this world is cruel annd I ain't the Lord , no I'm just a fool learning loving somebody don't make them love you 
You're so far away , and this is where I will always be , on the roads that don't end , and the views that never cease , with a feeling bittersweet 
Reject your sense of injury and the injury itself disappears ... 
I wish I could cross my arms , and cross your mind , cause I believe you'd unfold your paper heart and wear it on your sleeve ... 
take a good hard look in your textbook ... cause I'm history 
I sing you songs , I dance a dance , \ 
I gave your friends all a < PROPMALE > , putting up with them wasn't worth never having you 
-_- thats a good joke ... 
It’ll never be my chair that your on , the crown so tight that it cuts off circulation to the brain no oxygen , otherwords there’s no heir to the throne 
When words just can't express the way I feel ... 
You forget what you want to remember , and you remember what you want to \ 
forget 
CEDAR POINT = SICK WICKED AND NASTY :D 
Two words that can fix anything : I UNDERSTAND 
Don't ever be afraid to\

Striving for excellence motivates you ; striving for perfection is demoralizing . 
People who shut their eyes to reality simply invite their own destruction , and anyone who insists on remaining in a state of innocence long after that innocence is dead turns himslef into a monster

you believe in Jesus Christ , put this on your wall . Do not just ignore\ 
this . In the Bible it says , if you deny Me in front of your peers , I\

simple test . If you love God and are not afraid to show it , put this on\

When nothing seems to help , I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it . \

I just so happened to come across a picture and for some reason it brought me a twist of anger , pain , bittersweet joy and cold nolstalgia . I missed what was happening , however I was glad that it was over , but disappointed that it couldn't have lasted longer . I never did or ever will understand how something you loved could hurt so much . 
Nobody knows me , I'm cold , walk down this road all alone\ 
It's no one's fault but my own , it's the path I've chosen to go\ 
Frozen as snow , I show no emotion what'so ever , so\ 
Don't ask me why I have no love for these mo'fuckin ' hoes 
If you love somebody , let them go , for if they return , they were always yours . And if they don't , they never were 
Wouldve came back for you , \ 
I just needed time , to do what I had to do\ 
caught in the life , I cant let it go whether thats right I will never know , \ 
hoping you will forgive me , never meant wrong , \ 
tried to be patient , waited to long , \ 
but I wouldve came back , but i wouldve came back , 
weathered all of the storms , now its time to see the light and\ 
I never felt this way bout anythin in my life\ 
Determined to be the best , not lookin back at regrets\ 
How many people you blessed is how you measure success 
I did it all for you , \ 
still you were lonely , \ 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoLUklf1NLc&feature=related crazy shit right here smh 
ATTENTION : the group asking everyone to change their profile picture to a cartoon character is actually a group of pedophiles . They're doing it because kids will accept their friend request faster if they see a cartoon picture . It has nothing to do with any Child charities . It's on tonights ... news . Change your picture back to what it was asap . 
A true friend doesn't care when you're broke , being a bitch , what you weigh , if your house is a mess , what you drive , about your past , if your family is filled with crazy people . Your conversations pick up where they left off , even if they have been months apart . They love you for who you are . Re-post if u have @least 1 true friend . They will know who they are & still love you ....

All I know is You came to me when I was at my lowest . \

4.0 gpa first semester , Thank you God 
Its times like these where I don't know whether to listen to my brain or listen to my heart ... 
Never lie , steal , cheat , or drink . But if you must lie , lie in the arms of the one you love . If you must steal , steal away from bad company . If you must cheat , cheat death . And if you must drink , drink in the moments that take your breath away . 
:D 
< PROPFIRST > CONOLLY JUST BECAME MY NEW FAVORITE PLAYER !!! 
Defs dont want to be the giants right now lol 
Theres no combination of words\ 
I could put on the back of a postcard\ 
No song that I could sing\ 
But I can try for your heart\ 
Our dreams , and they are made out of real things\ 
Love is the answer\ 
At least for most of the questions in my heart\ 
Like why are we here And where do we go\ 
And how come it's so hard\ 
It's not always easy and\ 
I'll tell you one thing it's always better when we're together

You tripped me and I totally fell for you :) <3 
I always thought I needed physics to learn how to fly and float , but all I really needed was you :) 
Ive never been good with goodbyes and I dont know if its because Im too stupid to actually believe it or if its just cause Ive never been ready to let go 
I dont think its healthy to laugh that much hahah 
LAUGH so hard that even\ 
SORROW smiles at you ;\ 
FIGHT so strong that even\ 
FATE accepts defeat ; \ 
LOVE so true that even\ 
HATRED walks out of the way ;\ 
and LIVE life so well that even\ 
DEATH loves to see you exist 
Life is like a box of chocolates , you never know what youre gonna get next 
Faith is taking the first step even when you don't see the whole staircase . 
Pray not for easy lives . Pray to be stronger men and women

How many people you blessed is how you measure succes 
I was travelin on this road to long\ 
And I finally found my way back home\ 
( I'm glad to say ) The old me is dead and gone\ 
dead and gone-\ 
and I owe it all to Christ 
The past is history , the future is a mystery , but today is a gift from God . That is why we call it the present . 
“What you need to know about the past is that no matter what has happened , it has all worked together to bring you to this very moment . And this is the moment you can choose to make everything new . Right now . ” 
1 Corinthians 13 
\Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do . So throw off the bowlines . Sail away from the safe harbor . Catch the trade winds in your sails . Explore . Dream . Discover . ” " 
We must all suffer from one of two pains : the pain of discipline or the pain of regret . \ 
The difference is discipline weighs ounces while regret weighs tons . 
Life will always throw ya curve balls ... Thats when you hit it out of the park :D 
So often times it happens that we live our lives in chains \ 
And we never even know we have the key . 
“Watching you walk out of my life does not make me bitter or cynical about love . But rather makes me realize that if I wanted so much to be with the wrong person how beautiful it will be when the right one comes along . ” 
All change is not growth , as all movement is not forward . 
In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life : it goes on . 
Love is but the discovery of ourselves in others , and the delight in the recognition . 
All changes , even the most longed for , have their melancholy ; for what we leave behind us is a part of ourselves ; we must die to one life before we can enter another . 
Dreams have only one owner at a time . That's why dreamers are lonely . 
The privilege of a lifetime is being who you are . 
Always forgive your enemies - nothing annoys them so much . 
In any moment of decision the best thing you can do is the right thing , the next best thing is the wrong thing and the worst thing you can do is nothing . 
A nice mix of < PROPFIRST > Mayer and < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > son always does good for the heart and the soul :) 
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world\ 
Just a lie you've got to rise above 
I used to think the worst thing in life was to end up all alone . It's not . The worst thing in life is ending up with people who make you feel all alone . 
PUT THIS AS YOUR STATUS AND SEE WHAT PEOPLE RATE YOU : 1 . Crazy 2 . I'd kiss you ... 3 . Hyper !... 4 . Jerk ... 5 . I miss you ... 6 . Best friend ... 7 . Pretty .... 8 . Smart .. 9 . Dumb ... 10 . I would date you ... 11 . Random ... 12 . Hot ... 13 . Funny ... 14 . Huggable ... 15 . Amazing .. 16 . ... Tough .. 17 . Cute ... 18 . Beautiful ... 19 . .. Loud ... 20 . Awesome ... 
Problems are not stop signs , they are guidelines . 
Faith consists in believing when it is beyond the power of reason to believe . 
If you don't have time to do it right , when will you have time to do it over ? 
LOVE is EVOL , just spell it backwards and Ill show ya 
the man who travels fastest , travels alone 
No man chooses evil because it is evil . He only mistakes it for happiness ; the good he seeks 
Defeat is not the worst of failures . Not to have tried is the true failure . 
Happiness is not something you postpone for the future ; it is something you design for the present . 
One day your life will flash before your eyes . Make sure its worth watching 
We learn to love things that hurt , love things that we hate . Because sometimes , those are the only feelings that keep us motivated 
They love to tell you to stay inside the lines\ 
But something's are better on the other side 
Mastering others is strength . Mastering yourself is true power . 
A man who wants to lead the orchestra must turn his back on the crowd . 
Ignorance is bliss . 
We are all products of our past , but we are not prisoners of our past 
just about got harassed to check my mail . guess Ill go check it out lol 
even if you fall on your face , you're still moving forward . 
Excellence is never an accident . It is always the result of high intention , sincere effort and intelligent execution ; It represents the wise choice of many alternatives . CHOICE , not < PROPMALE > determines your < PROPFEMALE > 
Be your best friend , tell the truth , and overuse I love you\ 
Go to work , do your best , don't outsmart your common sense\ 
Never let your prayin knees get lazy\ 
And love like crazy 
Its only after we loose everything are we free to do anything
