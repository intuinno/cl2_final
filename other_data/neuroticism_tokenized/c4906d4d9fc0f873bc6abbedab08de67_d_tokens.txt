long weekend ......... this week a short one ........ that's not bad 
I wish I could clone about 4 Brian’s . I have a sh-t load of stuff this weekend , actually starting tonight and not enough hours in the day .. if you see the ole red Chevy coming down the road just move on over .. 
The hell weekend is over .... Hill had his first football game .... very funny to watch 6 year olds running around and hitting other 6 year olds ..... just too funny .... 
But , I still like bologna on white bread now and then , and the sound of a whippoorwill down a country road , the grass between my toes , and that sunset sinking low , and a good woman's love to hold me close 
Whitetail < PROPMALE > deer munchin on clover , redtail hawk settin on a limb , a Chubby old groundhog , croakin bullfrog , free as the feelin in the wind . Home grown country girl gonna give me a whirl on a Tennessee saturday night . Lucky as a seven livin in heaven with my dixieland delight . 
I'll fly a starship across the universe divide , And when I reach the other side , I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can , Perhaps I may become a highwayman again , Or I may simply be a single drop of rain , But I will remain , 
Tuxedo waiters , black tie , white table clothes and red wine , we've been planning , this night , looking forward to it for some time , now < PROPFEMALE > I know you love getting dressed up , and you know I love showing you off , but watching your baby blue eyes , dancing in the candle light glow , all I can think about , is getting you home , 
Well it's Monday morning , he's kissin ' momma goodbye , He's up and gone with the sun Daddy drives an eighteen-wheeler , And he's off on a midwest run , As three sad faces gather ' round momma , They ask her when daddy's comin ' home , Daddy drives an eighteen-wheeler , And they sure miss him when he's gone ( yeah they do ) 
Baby got a ' 69 mustang four on the floor , and you ought to hear the pipes ring I jump behind the wheel and it's away we go .. Hey , I drive too fast , but she don't care Blue bandana tied all up in her hair , Just sittin ' there singin ' every song on the radio 
Smooth as the hickory wind , That blows from Memphis , Down to Appalachia Coal It's hi ya'll did ya eat well , Come on in child , I'm sure glad to know ya , Don't let this old gold cross , In this < PROPFIRST > Daniels t-shirt throw ya , We're just boys making noise With the southern voice 
From Birmingham to Ohio , How they met nobody knows , Every now and then they get together , She used to wanna climb the walls , She'd never really been loved at all , Not until ol ' country came to town 
I was sittin ' in a coffee shop - Havin ' a cup and passin ' timeSwappin ' rodeo stories - With this cowboy friend of mineWhen some motorcycle rider - Started snickerin ' in the backAnd started pokin ' fun at my friend's hat . One ol ' boy said : 
\Hey Tex ! - Where'd you park your horse ? \ " My friend just pulled his hat down low - But they couldn't be ignoredOne husky dude said : - \ " Maybe I'll just rip that hat right off your head . \ " And that's when my friend turned around and said . " 
( Reporter ): Hello , everyone , this is your action news reporter with all the news that is news across the nation , on the scene at the supermarket . There seems to have been some disturbance here . Pardon me , sir , did you see what happened ? 
That hot ol ' summer sun make you beg for your next breath , So you best be on the creek bank laid in the shade . Chewin ' on a hickory twig , pass that bottle , I'll have me a swig , I ain't got a lot , but I think I got it made ( in the shade ) . 
You could push that car just a little too far any Sunday afternoon And if you break your neck in some damn fool's wreck they'd forget about you soon But old Stroker Ace was born to race and it's worth all the trying Just to drink champagne in the Victory < PROPFIRST > and to hear that concrete whine 
It's a downright joy for a country boy , When he hears them engines moan But you gotta < PROPFEMALE > tough and it gets real rough , When you're out there on your own Cause they'll push you around , they'll knock you down , When you're up there against the wall , And you always know when an engine blows , That a man can't win ' em all 
Ya'll have fun this weekend .... I'll try to drink a beer for all of you at Dega ...... I'll leave a tune that fits the race day up there ..... Tiff love you 
Well ok I have made through another Dega weekend .. I hope all had fun this weekend . Now it’s time to give my liver a rest . lol 
Just about 45 minutes , southeast of Tipidow , Louisiana There lived a man called Duck < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > and his pretty wife < PROPFEMALE > They raised up a son that could eat up his weight in groceries Named him after a man of the cloth . They called him < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > 
I got a hundred dollars smokin ' in my billfold , I know I oughta save it but it's burnin ' a hole , Right through my pocket and into my skin , Come Monday morning I'll be broke again , It's finally Friday , I'm free again , I got my motor running for a wild weekend It's finally Friday , I'm outa ' control , Forget the workin ' blues , And let the good times roll . 
Thank you and R.I.P. E5 Master Sergeant < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Griffin ( Pawpaw ) .... You are missed but not forgotten ......... And Thanks to all the Veteran's , who has serviced and is still servicing this country day in and day out ..

Squalls out on the Gulfstream , Big storms coming soon . I passed out in my hammock , God , I slept way past noon . Stood up and tried to focus , I hoped I wouldn't have to look far . I knew I could use a Bloody < PROPFIRST > , So I stumbled next door to the bar . 
Another sack of groceries , Another tank of gas , These days a dollar it goes to quick , Man , it just don't last , Always something , can't catch a break , Ain't no saving for a rainy day I'm a paycheck man , Working hired hand , I'd take this job and shove it but i just can't , Gettin ' up out of bed , Keepin ' them babies fed , 
?? ? ? On the 14th day of Christmas , my true Saints , hopefully , will give to me , 14 crushed Cowboys , 13 foolish Falcons , 12 refuted Redskins , 11 puking Patriots , 10 bitter Buccaneers , 9 rejected Rams , 8 prissy Panthers , 7 filthy Falcons , 6 dirty Dolphins , 5 gritty Giants , 4 jittery Jets , 3 baffled Bills , 2 endangered Eagles , and a lazy Lion looking for Falcon stew ! ?? ? ? 
Its < PROPFEMALE > in Chicago , The kids are out of school , There's magic in Motown , The city's on the move , In < PROPMALE > , Mississippi to < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , And all across the Nation , its a peaceful Christmas time , Christmas in < PROPFEMALE > , its snowing in the pines . < PROPFEMALE > Christmas from < PROPFEMALE > , to everyone tonight .

First and for most sorry for being late but THANKS FOR ALL THE BIRTHDAY WISHES last week . After being off for 7 days of work and 11 altogether for surgery I had a lot of work to get caught up on . 
A lot of doctors tell me / That I'd better start slowing it down / But there's more old drunks than there are old doctors / So I guess we'd better have another round\ " , 201 0-0 3-01 22:05:39 " 
I wear a greasy ball cap/I like my shirt untucked/I spend Saturdays working on my truck(or the wife’s car j/k Tiff)/I don't like to fight/But I ain't scared to bleed/Most don't mess with a guy like me/ ' Cause guys like me drink too many beers on Friday after work/Our best blue jeans have skoal rings/We wear our boots to church/So rough around the edges/It's hard to believe /That girls like you/Love guys like me

While you SCREAM at your woman , there's a\ 
man wishing he could talk softly in her ear .. While you HUMILIATE , \ 
OFFEND and INSULT her , there's a man flirting with her and reminding\ 
her how wonderful she is . While you HURT your woman , there's a man\ 
wishing he could make love to her . While you make your women CRY\ 
there's a man stealing smiles from her ... Post this on your wall if\ 
you're against Domestic Violence 
Very sadly , most of you probably won't copy\ 
and paste this . Will you do it and leave it on your status for at least\ 
an hour ? It's Special Education week , and this is in honour of all the\ 
kids who need a little extra help & understanding . We all need a\ 
little extra help sometimes ......

If you think , that\ 
putting up a mosque , 600 ft . from ground zero and having the\ 
inauguration , on the anniversary of 9/11/ is immoral , inhumane and a\ 
complete lack of respect for the memories of all that perished there , \ 
on that day and their survivors . That politicians are doing a grave\ 
injustice to the fallen heroes , their families and all the people of\ 
New York City THEN COPY AND PASTE THIS TO YOUR WALL

Children with special needs aren't sick or gross . They only want what we all want : to be accepted . Can I make a request of anyone willing to post this and leave it on your status for at least an hour ? It is Special Education week , and this is in honor of all children made in a unique way and who learn a little differently . 
A politician seeshis family everyday ; a deployed soldier once in 6 months . A politicianflies 1st class ; a soldier flies in a C130 . A politician's pension isnot reduced ; a soldier's is clawed 65% . A politician enjoys an expenseaccount ; a soldier must justify extra rations . A politician vows to ......... defend their country ; a soldier actually keeps that promise . REPOST IFYOU SUPPORT OUR TROOPS !

I saw an angel fall from grace when I was just eighteen , With\ 
lipstick on her cigarette and fire on both wings , She never even looked back , As\

This\ 
is cancer month . In memory of every cancer patient , family member &\ 
friend who has lost their battle with cancer , and in honor of those who\ 
continue to conquer . Put this up for 1 hour if you love someone who has\ 
or had cancer . 
Homeless go without eating . Elderly go without needed medicines . Mentally ill go without treatment . Troops go without proper equipment . Veterans go without benefits that were promised to them !! Yet we donate billions of dollars to other countries before helping our own first !!! 1% will re ... -post and ... the 99% of the people on FB won't have the spine or guts to repost this . 
Every person has 1000 wishes , a cancer patient only has one : to get better . I know 97% of you won't post this as your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do , in honor of someone who died of or is fighting cancer 
Happy Hallow-Dega 
Veteran is someone , who at one point in their life , wrote a blank check payable to the United States of < PROPFEMALE > for an amount up to , and including , their life . That is beyond honor , and there are way too many people in this country who no longer remember that fact .

Mr. \ 
President , I hear you would like to freeze pay rates for soldiers\ 
starting next year . Would you also consider cutting your own pay to\ 
save much more money for our country ? While you're at it , lets cut down\ 
congressman's pay too . If the people who risk their lives don't get an\ 
increase in pay , why would we continue raising pay for those who take\ 
no risks and reap the benefits ? Keep it going if you agree ! 
Happy Turkey Day to ya'll .... But from the sport guy this morning on tv ( Happy Saintgiving ) ..... 
Holidays\ 
are tough ....... wish heaven had a phone .... s o I could hear your voice\ 
again . I thought of you today ... bu thought of you yesterday and days\ 
before that too . I think of you in silence and often speak your name . \ 
All I have are memories and pictures in a frame ....... repost if you\ 
have someone in heaven that you miss on earth 
What's now my mind ... More like my chest ..... I was about 3\ 
cars back from the end of a funeral procession today and I had about 10 cars\ 
pass me and they were trying to pass the end car in that procession . Finally one of the other cars that was in the\ 
funeral procession got in the middle of the road to stop the passing that was\ 
going on . 
I love my wife , she is the most wonferful person alive !! I am so damn lucky to have her 
Bullshit 
You know I’m chilling on the back roads , Laid back rollin’ to some < PROPFIRST > Jones , \ 
Smoke rollin’ out the window , An ice cold beer sittin’ in the console , Memory < PROPFIRST > up in the headlights , It’s got me reminiscing on the good times , Sittin’ turning off the real life , driving that truck , Hittin’ easy street in mud tires 
I couldn't have had a better Christmas ... I had both boys for several days for Christmas . I shot nice 9 point with a fine group of guys and dogs , Saints bet Atlanta and all I need now to finish the year off or I guess you could say start the new year is for MSU to win Saturday ........ O ya maybe another deer Friday ... and maybe even Saturday ......... 
Five-hundred channels and there ain't much on tonight\
