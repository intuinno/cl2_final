Nothing is better to kick off the new year than running a 5k and placing well it wasn't a pb but I've never ran a race that was half uphill either . 
Calling all running buddies anyone interested in making a team to run the reach the beach relay a 200 mile race broken up into 36 legs with a maximum team size of 12 . It is in September in NH . Also a 190 mile one in may in < PROPFEMALE > . I think it would be fun serious runners only though . 
I had an amazing night , Its been a long time since I felt this way ahhh 
OK so my dog does not knock the trash can over to get in it , she carefully and silently opens the lid , piles up stuff to get higher then reaches inside and pulls just one piece then shuts the lid , oh my I am in trouble with this one

I so Love dancing around at Champion Kidz Church , Great leaders , crazy kidz , not to much can be better . 
OK so I was just rehearsing for Mega prayer night and it was amazing , MPN on Friday is going to be insaine if just running through the songs was this powerful 
Whew I just apologized to someone that I have needed to for a long time , about the way I have thought about them and spoke about them , It was hard to do since my pride kept getting in the way but now I feel like a weight has been lifted off my heart , Thank You Jesus . 
3 More Days till I get to jump into an Icy lake for an Ice Rescue Class , ahhh 
I think it is Funny that when it Rains in AZ , it is an Emergency , Closes Schools , and it is the farmers enemy . I just find it ironic because where I grew up we would still have to go to school even with the roads covered in Snow and Ice , We just drove slower , or skied to school or church . 
Wow my expectation for tonight has transfered to a feeling I can not explain other than fearfull . Fearfull Of God and his presence , this is a very good thing . See you tonight at Mega Prayer Night 
Wow what a great night .. Well to all my facebook friends I will be unreachable for the next week , no internet , no phone , no nothing , Just me and nature and a bunch of crazy dogs dogsledding in MN . Hopefully I will not freeze to death . chao 
I'mmm Baaack , Got home very early this morning , It was a totally life changing trip ... Hopefully I can get my nag today since it was lost last night .

I can't wait to hopefully see you this summer ... 
Just found an old hand written letter from a family friend that survived and escaped the genocide in Cambodia , And I am once again outraged and inspired to spread the word that you must not rely on Schools to feed u all the knowlwdge you think you need . Do your own reasearch expcially in History . During my lifetime there was a massive genocide and If it wasn't for this man sharing I would have never known . 
Doing accounting to the groove of the office next to us freestyling some amazing jazz music with a tenor sax , bass guitar and vocals , it is making my afternoon fun . 
Does anyone want to go to the Renissance Faire on Saturday Afternoon after City Care ? I have an extra ticket ...

Yeah so this woman came in to pick up a key , when she left she dropped a itty bitty little black thong on the floor in front of my desk . I can not wait to tease her when she comes back to return the key . LMAO

OK I admit it , I have a crush on < PROPFIRST > Vonn 
I think that it is rediculous that people look at me strange when I am dancing and goovin along to my Ipod at the Gym , I mean it makes the workouts so much better , I think they are secretly jelous that they don't have the balls to groove out as well , But hey it makes people smile and makes me feel good so I aint stopping . 
My Bike is in the shop today , hoping they can finish it . If so does anyone want to go on a Mtn Bike run somewhere in the desert on Sat ? 
Going on a road trip , no idea to where , See yall at church tomorow , it just may not be 1st service haha

Wow I just followed through on declining my dream job of 9 Years , It sucks being an adult sometimes . But I have total peace about this decision , and I have no doubt that this is the right decision . But I am not going to lie I am a little bummed out .

If there is anything that this horrible tragedy can teach us , it's that a male model's life is a precious , precious commodity . Just because we have chiselled abs and stunning features , it doesn't mean that we too can't not die in a freak gasoline fight accident . 
So I lug around three gym bags three color coded water bottles and got the abs to prove it lol I'm a dork . 
< PROPFEMALE > yup I'm board Wana do something somewhere with someone .

It is almost 2011 and yet I can't go even one day without hearing a racial , homophobic or other discriminatory remark or joke . It's not funny , it's not ok and it has got to stop I'm so sick of it . Staying silent is not the answer let's make waves by confronting those who utter hate . 
Do you ever wonder if a person in your dream was dreaming the same dream from their point of view kindof like a alternate psychic reality . 
Today I am thankful for all the supporters of the military those who send letters and care packages to my brothers and sisters who are deployed . It makes a big difference in the day of a deployed member . If you want info on how to do this let me know I'll get you hooked up with a great service . 
Today I'm thankfully for all of you ... Well most of you anyways jk Happy Thanksgiving 
Someone please come and eat all the leftover pies and cookies I have worked way to hard to get fat again ...

Drivin to Mass here in a short bit , Excited to drive in a car that has heat .. see it is the small things in life that make me happy ... but dont get me wrong I like the big things too so feel free to send me some big checks or 100 dollar bills 
Seeing pictures of this years Jesus is born and seeing sets that I painted with < PROPFIRST > last year makes me feel like I am still a part of the production and makes me feel so blessed to have been an active part of it for so long . Love you Champion 
Gata plan a wicked Christmas dinner but first gata go to the gym because I just gata y'all donchaknow 
It's still snowing I can't wait too see how many inches of snow will be on the ground when I wake up . It's going to be a white Christmas ! Good night 
Now that was a great workout 5 mile run 2 mile cross country ski , shoulders and traps then a pick up basketball game . No wonder I can't find a gym partner as I am clearly insane 
Just spent way to much on gifts but that's ok it's only once a year and I love giving gifts . 
Happy Christmas < PROPFEMALE > ... Why the freak am I awake so early ... 
Happy birthday to my role model , close friend and savior JESUS . < PROPFEMALE > Christmas y'all! Ps < PROPFEMALE > please remember I moved again this year but not opening gifts here but next-door at grandmas if that's to confusing I'm sorry but that's just how I roll . 
Playing catch phrase baby . Oh so fun 
\The man who follows the crowd will usually get no further than the crowd . The man who walks alone is likely to find himself in places no one has ever been before . \ " \ 
Well 2 feet of snow should be fun .. not but good for snowboarding and skiing so it evens out I guess . 
Ok I'm off to play in the snow or shovel how ever you like to think about it . Hopefully I won't get blown away 
Ugh snow days are such a waste of time I could be out getting paid but no suck home melting my brain at the tv 
Kinda excited for tonight I'm not going to lie 
Maybe second time's a charm ,,, I sure hope so 
I hate waking up stressed out and frustrated from a dream .. In my dream both things I hate the most happened not being able to accomplish a big task because of lack of support and kids talking over me being rude while I'm trying to teach rock climbing . 
\Life is a grindstone . Whether it grinds you down or polishes you up depends on the stuff you are made of . \ " \ 
Where did this year go ?? I remember where I was exactly a year ago even remember what I wore , all I know is I'm way better today than 365 days ago so here's to the next 365 
Wow crazy good run today , the weather was < PROPFEMALE > warm almost 50 degrees . 
The sun is shining the wind is howling the thermometer reads 31 and my back is killing me so I can't think of anything better to do than squeeze into my sexy tights and go for a steady run along the coast

To my outdoorsy people , I have a pair of mens size sm PATAGONIA black pants that are 93% polyester 7% spandex that I can not wear an never have . They would be perfect for hiking climbing whatever really . If you can fit in them guy or girl and want them Ill send them too you . 
Sorry Here I go Again but It is 2011 We need to stop the hate , I was playing poker online and I can not tell you how many nasty hatefull things were said about muslems , retarded etc I of course corrected them all but its stupid . If you encounter any hate speech of any kind even in joking stand up and correct it . Lets make the world better one idiot at a time lol 
PLEASE - put this on your status if you know someone ( or are related to someone ) who has been eaten by dragons . Dragons are nearly unstoppable and , in case you didn't know , they can also breathe fire . 93% of people won't copy and paste this , because they have already been eaten by dragons . 6% of people are sitting in the shower armed with fire extinguishers & the remaining 1% are awesome and will re-post this .

I freakin hate snow days , no work = no money and no money = boared

What could possibly be so important that my 80+ year old grandfather thought he should drive somewhere during this snow storm . I looked out the window and his car was gone . Gosh him on normal roads makes me nervous him on slippery snowy roads makes me very nervous 
Well off to catch the train to visit a school in Cambridge , < PROPFEMALE > and then spend the day with my Brother < PROPFIRST > Its going to be cold but well worth it I think .. 
You know one thing I've observed is that people are very scared to have their voice be heard to say or do anything that could bring attention or notice to themselves but also that people are desperate for acknowledgement and to be seen heard and understood . Interesting how the two go together . 
Being in Boston reminds me that it is < PROPFEMALE > time to move again . Well maybe in the summer or fall . Not saying Boston but somewhere with people . 
Holy Moley it is Cold nothing like a wind chill of -25

A very wise woman said that absence does not make the heart grow fonder well in this case I have to disagree . Absence has made my heart grow much much fonder . It's almost painful

Force them to see our humanity . And for those who would call you a coward , remind them that non-violence does not protect you from the violence of your oppressor . But be stronger than your opponent-do not respond to their violence with your own . The purpose of demonstrating is to communicate to the world . ( The Hour of Sunlight ) 
It's interesting that many people or things you regarded as wrong , bad or off after some time to understand them and their intentions can become right or understood or somewhere in the middle . There are three sides to everything ... Your - theirs- and the real truth that can only be discovered by understanding both all sides . 
So today I met the reigning world champion of log rolling and I had been working with her for months now . How cool is that

I hate 40 degrees it is a temp that teases me it's a bit warmer so I can go outside but still to cold to hike for a while . So I'll split the difference and walk to dunkin donuts . But yes 40 degrees is better than 30 
Thinking of fostering another puppy . Not sure though it is a big commitment so it would need to be a right fit 
What did I do today well I walked slot since the weather was a balmy 40 degrees and rockclimbed a bit and now I'm watching an idiot abroad and my elbows hurt
