It's snowing in Palmdale !!! 
after 3 weeks of waiting to see Avatar , I have concluded that it quite possibly the best movie I have ever seen . Not only for it's absolute beauty but for it's story . Some will say that it's predictable but it opened my eyes to a different way of looking at life . Simply inspirational . 
Getting my new Blackberry Curve 8530 tomorrow :) yay ! 
fuck Verizon , fuck Asurion , I'm going to kill someone , I've been on hold for almost an hour , 2 and a half hours total to get absolutely nothing done . 
<---- look at that face ! <3 
Okay , so this shirt says ' P*ssy Eater ' ; which is like , no disrespect to like vaginas , or vegeterians , or ? < PROPFEMALE > cats ... But it's like ... I'm hungry , right ? ;] \ " , 201 0-0 2-04 22:54:26 " 
In the corner beside my window , there hangs a lonely photograph . There is no reason I'd never notice , A memory that could hold me back . There is a wound that's always bleeding , there is a road I'm always walking , And I know you'll never return to this place . 
they found my < PROPFEMALE > ! She was waiting outside my sisters school , cold , tired and hungry but she's ok ! I am so relieved . To those of you who know my dog , thank you for your kind wishes ! 
Goof <3 
Apparently I never knew that Blackberry's support podcast downloads . Wow I'm an idiot , however , I can listen to Frosty , < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > Carolla again . I am so happy . 
The vet sais Yoshi weighs 8 pounds . Can someone please explain how she can possibly weigh that much ? There's no way in hell that's possible . 
My little Yoshi <3 is at the vet getting her female parts removed and I can't get her back until morning , my poor little baby . 
I got my Yosh back !!! I am so happy ! 
I just bankrupted myself on the Lude >.< 
Just watched The Bounty < PROPMALE > , it was awful . < PROPMALE > Butler didn't even make it good . FAIL ! 
\A man's ego is bruised deeper than the flesh \"- Spartacus . " 
New Spartacus + New Fringe = The greatest 2 hours of my life . 
I did my taxes all by myself and didn't mess up , yay :) 
Big day tomorrow , I hope my actions are perceived with good intent . 
my < PROPFEMALE > is being pushed to the point of no return and at this point and I'm not playing nice anymore . 
Kill . Them . All . 
You've unleashed the demon , welcome to your new found reality . You will reap what you sow . 
I feel liberated , its nice . 
We had 4 patrol units AND a helicopter pull up on us because some asshole thought we were stripping my car . It was EPIC . 
Cars almost done , yay ! It's broken 4 sockets , 3 studs for the manifold , a power steering adjuster bolt , 1 bolt off the oil pan , and like 5 other bolts that are all special order for some reason . Go < PROPMALE > Honda bolts ! FML . 
I've been without a car since Sunday and I'm really missing 4cyl fuel consumption lol . Sorta screw the 5.9 V8 in the Ram were driving . You actually have to budget your driving and where you can go because it costs $20 everytime . FML . 
YAY !! Car is done ! SO happy to be driving it again . SO much better than the Dodge Ram :) 
no one should be up this early ... 
I'm going camping tonight , ya baby ! 
my one day off went by too quick . FML . 
... give me the freedom to destroy , give me a radioactive toy . 
I had no clue it's illegal to remove ANY properly functioning cat off your car in CA . That's the gayest thing I've ever heard . You can't even buy one here . I need to move ASAP . 
my mom is easy to shop for on mothers day lol . 
woke up this morning to a lovely exhaust leak . Honda lawnmower FTL . 
Seriously , screw this exhaust leak . 
\Welcome to Costco . I love you\ " . Best movie ever is Idiocracy . "

Asshole FedEx ! Where's my exhaust !? 
Yay ! FedEx redeemed itself . 
Oh boy do I ever love pickles . So much in fact , that I drink the juice ( YUM ! ) . The kosher , fancy pickles with the garlic are the best . MMM PICKLES ! 
So were at the drivethru to < PROPMALE > Taco and when the guy asked me what hot sauce I wanted , I said \the black one\ " like I always do because I forget what its called . Then I look up and the guy is black . It was funny to say the least lolz . " 
I ate a pack of sour skittles last night and my mouth is raw from the little bastards . What a misleading < PROPFEMALE > , the more you eat , the more your mouth bleeds . FML ! 
nothing like getting paid at work to watch Initial D lol 
I'm slightly frightened by her happiness lol\ 
http://comedy.video.yahoo.com/?l=3774749&v=7519839 
Getting my windows tinted as I type this at work ! LOL .

Scored a 5 gallon Mobil 1 synthetic oil jug for $23 at Walmart . It's $6.47 per quart at Kragen :) 
I want a 3rd gen ipod touch .. Can anyone of you computer geniuses help me out with that ? I know I have like 20 of you guys as friends , lol . I don't know crap about Apple , just that I want the newest one ! haha .

I'm really getting sick of this whole not being able to eat bull crap . Stomach is all sorts of fudged up . Oatmeal , soup , and shakes is getting old . I'm tired of always being hungry :( 
So happy prop 17 didn't pass . 
I came up sick status with an Apexi WS2 2.5 \ piping and resonator for $40 + my stock exhaust . Be jealous ;) " 
I am so damn sick of this soup diet ! Give me some real food damn it ! 
nothing like a midnight movie . bad lieutenant is in the ps3 tonight . 
Who wants to come over and help us start my 5 speed swap tonight ? 
What's up with everyone being is such a shitty mood ? Jesus . :: Just keep on smiling Jess :: 
Damnit all to hell . 
Why does everyone on the world have to call AAA today to make my life living hell . As if my shitty day yesturday wasn't enough . Having 12 calls and no drivers sucks ass . 
Prelude is in the shop getting my custom exhaust put on . I'm nervous and impatient . I hope it sounds good LOL . 
SO HAPPY ! Exhaust came out exactly how I wanted ! 
no computer at work makes < PROPFEMALE > a very sad person . at least I have a blackberry ! 
Damn you apple and your one computer Syncing crap . Just let me add the damn cd !! 
I'm trying to figure out why people will in from japan to visit < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE>'s memorial . I don't get it . Why do people care this much ? Damn !

This is a god awful time to be awake . 
Shibby !

I want to go see Porcupine Tree on August 13th . Someone give me $100 to buy a ticket ! 
I don't understand why the east coast is huffing and puffing about 100 Degree weather . We deal with those temps every summer for months . Can someone tell me why they are crying ? 
I thought I was having some sort of a flashback with that earthquake . My desk turned into waves lol . 
Grown Ups = Win 
It's fucking raining . I call earthquake weather . 
Don't you hate it when you have an amazing dream , and then you wake up and have a hard time adjusting to your reality ? 
The first time my Prelude EVER broke down and needed a tow , I let Arin borrow it . Damn coolant hose . You'd figure that I work for AAA so I get towing service . Nope . Shit . 
So the Lude busted a return coolant line today . Cut the hose and refilled coolant but something is off . Taking it to Jasons tomorrow for a compression test and diagnosis . This is the last thing I needed right now . 
I'm freezing at work :P 
I guess I know the lude is just fine when it keeps up with a 07 civic si 3rd gear to 110 :) remind you she has a dying auto tranny . 
This is the ONLY time in 4 years I've been happy to have a damn tape player in the Lude . Finally a use for it ! 
A spaceship from another < PROPFEMALE > , they ask me where all the people are . What should I tell them ? I tell them I'm the only one , there was a war but I must of won . Please take me with you . 
Anyone know why the HC ( hydro carbons ) for my emissions is high ? It's at the maximum of 55 PPM for my 2008 smog . It's not cheap gas for sure . I have not done a tune up for 45k . Now it's time for another smog and I need to know what I should do beforeso it passes . 
Time for late spring maintenance , clogged EGR , valve adjustment , tune up , and exhaust leak here I come ? Now , who wants to come help me ? lol . 
GUYS I need your help ASAP ! I cant get my EGR plugs out and they have been tapped through already . I need my car tonight to get home . What is a temperary fix ? A screw has already broken off in the plug and they wont fucking budge ! HELP ! 
I am so done with the prelude and the curse has barley started to unleash it's wrath :( 
its official , #2 cylinder exhaust valves are dead . need a valve job . fuck my life . how much does this run ? 
It's amazing how quick your life falls apart when you don't have a car and can't afford to fix it and you owe $200 that you don't have to register it in one month and it needs $1000 worth of work . Just fucking amazing . 
Right when you think It just cannot get any worse , its gets 10 times worse . 
SUCKS not having a car ... 
If anyone is feeling generous , please feel free to donate your spare change and/or mechanic related services to me .. Accepting at all times .

Prognosis is good on the Lude . Started after sitting for over a week and it shot out whatever piece of crap that was stuck in it through the exhaust . Now to replace the fuel injector o-rings so it stops leaking fuel and hopefully fixes the knock from misfire ( I hope that's it ) . Trying not to be too optimistic , It's never this easy . Expecting some variation of valve damage , that's ok though ... 
Replaced injector o rings , life ran fine for 5 < PROPFEMALE > until a piece of metal got sucked into cylinder #2 and bent the spark plug . Took valve cover off and fished out as much of the shavings as possible . It now sounds like an empty spray paint can . Yay . 
Got the small piece of drill bit out of cylinder #2 . Putting it back together , hopefully there is minimal wall damage . Wish me luck . 
Taking the head off tonight , hopefully < PROPFIRST > will have it by tomorrow . 
I want eight-six back ! 
Right when I figured it's about time to ask the boss for some much needed time off after working 6 days a week for the past 1 1/2 years , to the point where it's mentally stressing me out ( even during dreams ) , he gets 4 claims filed on his insurance . So long 2 days off in a row . 
Fuck you rubberband for snapping and hitting me in the face . 
I can relate , cause lately I've been thinking of combustication as a welcome vacation from\ 
the burdens of the planet Earth . 
Inception = WTF 
Officially non- op'ed the Prelude , wow this sucks . 
Today can go to hell . 
30min countdown to the lamest Initial D marathon ever ! I'm so excited ! Today was a shit day . 
Honestly , I don't know how my life could get much worse right now . When it rains , it pours . 
I miss my Yoshi <3 
Thanks everyone for the birthday wishes ! We enjoyed the 117 degree weather in Laughlin this weekend , on our way home to my weeeee <3 ! 
started making spaghetti thinking I had spaghetti noodles and I have fettuccine . shit . oh well , hope it turns out good lol . 
OH how I miss my car . I haven't driven anything in over a month , unless you count the time I moved eight-six in the driveway . I can't sit passenger for much longer , I'm going nuts . I'm a driver , not a seat warmer , damn it ! 
< PROPFIRST > Estrada is making a speech at the North East Police station across the street from my work . So lame . 
Ok , so along with < PROPFIRST > Estrada , < PROPFIRST > De La Hoya and the chief of police are coming to . What the hell is going on here ? 
FLASHBACK for those GenX'ers . Enjoy ! \

NO Top Gear , I do not want to know who The Stig is . Some say that his left nipple is the shape of the Nürburgring , all I WANT TO know is he's called The Stig .

yay , time to leave for work -_- 
Curse you Apple ! Windows 7 code 10 and 43 , will not recognize my ipod touch . Did/done itunes uninstall , driver uninstall and reinstall but the damn computer won't recognize it , not even the iphone4 . It worked yesterday , not today . 
I do say , today is going to be a long day .. 
Yesterday I saw 2 young female elephants being forced to give ( morbidly obese ) people rides in circles all day at the L.A. County Fair . The sign said \These elephants spend 2/3's of their time relaxing in a \ " natural like\ " habitat\ " but the tears in their eyes suggest otherwise . Everyone who aids in the suffering of helpless creatures deserves to be torn apart by a pack of hyena's . Period . " 
Watchin ' Old Boy , don't know what the hell is going on but it's good so far lol . 
Mmm ! Thank you 7/11 for the awesome coffee and banana's in the morning . Yum . 
Ahh , wake up call set for 5am , FML . 
One pill makes you larger and one pill makes you small , and the ones that mother gives you don't do anything at all , go ask < PROPFEMALE > when she's 10 feet tall . 
What color should I paint my h22 valve cover ? Open to suggestions , but remember I'm doing it so don't get crazy ! I'm talking out of the can , only one color job lol . Theme is black on red but red is too common maybe neon green ? Lol .

I can't believe I finished all 3 seasons of True Blood in under a week . Mediocre acting but excellent story line . Good shit . 
Got to sock buns in my hair tonight . It's supposed to make your hair curly without damaging it . If I wake up at 6am to some funky ass hair , I'm going to flip . 
Trying to swallow a mouthful of sh ! t is harder than it seems .. 
Beautiful day :) Cloudy , rainy , foggy .. Just how I like it , depressing lol . 
Nothing like having an anxiety attack over peeling a whole cooked shrimp or crawfish :( SeriOusly !? What is that ? 
Rain+Open diff . 86 = Bad news .. 
Nothing like getting to work right now with my tow truck in the middle of the street because it caught on fire .. Just to see the look on my boss ' face when he found out was priceless . 
I think I just scored a * mint * set of RSX leather seats and maybe 16\ rims . Will the Base non Type-S seats work on the 5th gen ? " 
Lost the deal on the car . Seriously last minute crap . So pissed . 
Just found out the new bitch at work conned me into switching my 7am-2pm shift at work to 12-7pm because she \ has court today\ " . The courts are closed today . Scandalous . I'm going to burn her ass . " 
Finished the first 2 Sookie Stackhouse books in 10 days . Pretty good for someone who hasn't read a book from a series since < PROPMALE > Potter .

Just bought the recently released Porcupine Tree Anesthetize DVD on Amazon for $12 new . I am so happy . 
Ahh , finished my third book in 2 weeks . I feel more accomplished than usual :D 
Every week day I wake up at 5am in Palmdale , to be at work in LA by 7 . And everyday I find another reason why I should wake up earlier O_o 
There's nothing here for you under the sun , there's nothing new to do , its all been done , so put your faith in another place . 
How lucky am I when I get away with a tail light fix it ticket in Glendale ? I mean , that's what the 3rd ticket in 2 years I've walked away clean from ? Damn , must be cause I'm not Armenian lol :P

2 hour drive home to Palmdale thanks to the asshole fire at Agua < PROPFEMALE > . This was the order : 1st , clutch , 1st , clutch , 1st ahhh 2nd , clutch , and repeat for 2 damn hours . Uphill ... 
just checked in at my dentist , same dentist for almost 20 years . . good times are about to happen , they always do when you need oral surgery . 
tooth pain is the worst pain if you ask me . I swear I just paid my dentist $100 for the second worst trip there in my life .

My blood type is O-/RH- therefore : the lack of Rh in the DNA or blood means that one having this trait does NOT SHARE DNA OR EVOLUTIONARY BACKGROUND WITH THE APES and therefore the commonly held theory of evolution is totally lacking in an explanation for this phenomenon .

32 degrees outside here in Palmdale . Not cold by a lot of your standards but damn freezing for California . 
Donating blood at GCC today :) 
Watching a VW CC , 750i , infinity i45 , 2 C300's , and a old school S class race each other on Glenoaks bro . All of us stopping together at every red light , while we do the speed limit in 86 and they go 65 LOL , Silly armos . 
I want a 2011 Honda Fit . Keep the lude as a weekend warrior , DD the fit . Done and done . 
Hey guys , finally got the head off my H22 after my unfortunate \drill bit fell inside\ " incident . If I can ask my Prelude homies to check out my photos and give me their opinion on my cylinder walls I would appreciate it . Thanks ! " 
Today is December 1st , 2010 and its official , my Prelude is up and running after a 4 month sleep . She lives !!! 
Lude is out to get smoged , I hope that ISH passes ! 
Today was her first bath in 4.5 months .

Am I the only one who didn't know < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > died ? 
I just found lost treasure !! 
Guys : How manly do you feel when a girl has to install your battery on your Prelude ? 
I hate everyone who is calling AAA today . Seriously , GFY . 
Anyone interested in buying a Verizon Blackberry 8530 ? Perfect working condition , few scratches on screen , includes silicone case and charger . $100 OBO . 
Should I preorder the iphone4 on Verizon .. Hmm . I think I'm going with the HTC Thunderbolt .. Decisions , decisions ... 
I could walk outside at 4am in shorts and no jacket because it's like a perfect summer night out right now :) 
I need a vacation . I need to get away from EVERYONE for at least a week .. To bad I can't afford to take even ONE single day off of work . Working 6 days a week for 2 years has got me nowhere apparently . Life can go EFF itself right now .

Woke up to a shitty day starting with me stepping in dog shit , then 7/11 ran out of creamer , then I put way to much sugar in my coffee so it tastes like shit , then AAA gives me a shit HOT call going to Sylmar blocking the 101 with NO drivers . O.o 
How hard is it to adjust balance shaft belt tensioner thing on a H22a4 ? I think that's the culprit of my \supercharger\ " like sound for the past 2k . " 
Duh and or hola .. 
I do not approve of french vanilla or hazelnut flavored coffee . 7/11 on La Crescenta and Montrose sucks ass ! 
I am the luckiest driver alive :) 
My driving statistics : I've been pulled over by the police 5 times in the past 6 months and I have not gotten 1 single ticket :D Including last night when GDPD pulled me over for tinted windows . He let me go w/o a citation AND I didn't have my driver's license on me . Jealous much ? I think so :p 
I think that it's safe to assume our 11 year old cat Mikie has gone off to pass away since he hasn't been seen in over 3 weeks . RIP meow , I'll always miss you little guy . :: tear :: 
Homemade carnitas , rice , and pico de gallo :) and some homemade zucchini bread for desert . Life can't get any better right now :) 
Screw you 7/11 for discontinuing Coffee Mate creamer . Seriously GFY . 
BREAKING NEWS !! A water main broke in Sun Valley and if we were in anything other than eight-six , we would have got stuck :) Yay ! 
I am recuperating from an apparent caffeine overdose from last night . One of the worst experiences of my time alive so far . 
Just finished my 2010 taxes . I believe I can speak for most others when I say that Uncle < PROPFIRST > can go screw himself . And on top of that , all this social security I'm paying isn't going to be there when I need it . Fuck this system , I'm out as soon as I can . 
The line at Krispy Creme is easily comparable to the wait at DMV . I didn't come out of my way to not leave with my delicious krispy cremes lol . 
I locked my purse with my keys , phone , and wallet in my trunk tonight ... For the first time in 7 years . Thank god I work for a tow company and have awesome drivers on call whenever I need them :) 
dear today : GOFYourself . k thanks . 
Be jealous that you can't smell my delicious homemade zucchini bread baked with love . 
Also be jealous that homemade orange chicken and fried rice is being made for dinner before zucchini bread is to be eaten . 
OMG new Archer at 10 . Are you ready ? Duh and or hello .. 
I have to open a bakery of my own ... I will start by taking orders for any one of my scrumptious creations ;)

I do not want your shitty food . Please go feed it to the dogs outside , if they would even eat it . No , no thank you , I'm allergic to cat piss . k thanks bye . 
I NEED someone who has done a timing belt on a 5th gen ( in the LA area ) to please , please help me put the new on back on right . I will compensate for time and gas . Everything will already be taken apart , all I need is the tensioner and belts assembled properly . 
UPDATE : Timing belt pulley adjuster , balance belt pulley , timing belt , and the asshole bolt that goes inside are all being replaced . Timing belt has been rubbing for 5k and that bolt was - close to snapping . Total cost to boss $345 . Total cost to me $0 . WIN = WIN . 
My $15 special order bolt came early today !! I cannot describe the catastrophic failure that would succumb from that bolt slipping through the tensioner .. I am so amazingly lucky to have caught this literally RIGHT before doomsday would happen . 
$48 to fill 13 gallons today . Damn you premium sucking Prelude . 
WOO HOO ! New work desk chair . About time because the ass of the 400lb lady who works with me ruined my last one . Best part ; she can't fit into the new one . Wow , I'm mean LOL . 
I am 100% positive that my timing belt is rubbing again after I just had it replaced . WTF . Someone needs to do this shit right or I'm going to kill someone . 
Going skating at < PROPFEMALE > beach today . Ya it's 72 out in the middle of winter , it's ok though I think we'll be ok ;) 
To HTC Thunderbolt it or not ... Decisions decisions . 
I keep having this dream that I'm driving and I have no brakes .. Last night I was driving a tow truck and I was towing my car and I couldn't stop .. Why ? 
Goodbye my lovely 7am-2pm shift .. Back to the bullshit 12-7pm 6 days a week :( 
Off work in 0030 , then back again for a 7am-7pm tomorrow .. Then a 7am-2pm Friday . I'm tired just thinking about it ... Eff this life man . 
Chevron premium went up 20 cents in 1 day . That makes me sad .. :( 
12 hours into work and I don't know when the hell I'm leaving . 
Just finished Låt den Rätte Komma In ( Let the Right One In ) in Swedish . There is a more recent remake in the US ( Let Me In ) that is pale in comparison to the original . If you're down , I highly suggest it :) 
If anyone needs a car battery ( or knows anyone who does ) , let me know . I have wholesale prices on Interstate and Optima batteries . Message me for more info ! 
Just relishing in the fact that I've gone 2 years without a pay raise .. Now only with twice the amount of work and stress to cope with . 
Successfully drank 2 glasses of blackberry merlot last night without dying ( no turning red , no swollen throat , no dizziness or blacking out ) . I think I found my poison of choice for the first time in my life :) 
Relieved .. Yet strangely depressed that I just spent $375 to fix my timing belt issue .. Which turned out to be a balance belt that was on to tight amongst a few other things . The cost of peace of mind is outstanding . 
So just stick that in your juice box and suck it ! 
Winning ... 
< PROPFIRST > Durden says watch Fight Club . Now . 
\The things you own end up owning you\ " - < PROPFIRST > Durden " 
$375 later : back balance shaft was off a tooth on alignment , balance belt was on extremely tight , and the balance shaft seal retaining plate was missing entirely .. Explain's a lot . 
i <3 < PROPMALE>'s burger on fox (: 
< PROPMALE > , is that how you get ants ? Yes it is other < PROPMALE > , yes it is . 
I swear I can't do it . I can't deal with snoring . Absolute worst thing in the world to me . Headphones and earplugs only get me so far . This shit will keep me up all night . FML . 
I think beef and vegetable soup is happening right now ... homemade baby ! 
I am very tired . I would very much like for this night to end , like right now .. ktnxbye . 
FU cold . I don't have time to be sick . Weak . 
Today can honestly be going better .. 
I got 2 tickets to NASCAR at the Auto Club Speedway on Sunday + FREE parking . Anyone want to buy them ? I'm not amused by idiots turning left . Hit me up if interested . 
I haven't slept this high up in a bed in a really long time lol . I'm at least 3 ' up on a twin , and to be honest I think I might fall off tonight lmao .
