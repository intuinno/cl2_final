Qoute of the day : In life you are going to make mistakes , you're going to fall down , but it's the getting up that counts . Just like in baseball : you'll get a few hits , but most likely , you'll strike out more than you'll get on base . But don't quit . Find your focus , relax , take a deep breath and give it a good swing\ < PROPMALE > Pelzer - A Man Called < PROPMALE > " 
School is such a lie sometimes ... scratch that A LOT of the times

Came from lgr ... was pretty confident about colleges , but now has had a sudden realization and is seriously confused and feeling oh so so stupid =/ 
“So what do we do then , with tragedy around the bend ? We live , we love , we forgive and never give up , cuz the days we are given are gifts from above and today we remember to live and to love and tragedy’s a reminder to take off the blinders and wake up ( to live the life ) We’re suppose to take up ( Moving forward ) , With all our heads up , cuz life is worth living ” We Live ~ Superchick * Awesome song * 
I was having a suckish day , but now I'm the happiest girl in the world !!!!!!! IM SO GLAD !!! XD Yay !!! 
\Rose : That hope was all I had left ... What am I suppose to do now ? Tell me what to do .... please . \ 
He who despairs of the human condition is a coward , but he who has hope for it is a fool . \

“I’ll tell them how I survived it . I’ll tell them that on bad mornings , it feels impossible to take pleasure in anything because I’m afraid it could be taken away . That’s when I make a list in my head of every act of goodness I’ve seen someone do . It’s like a game . Repetitive . Even a little tedious after more than twenty years . \ 
But there are much worse games to play . ” ~ Katniss , Mockingjay , 398

People are like dice , a certain Frenchman said that . You throw yourself in the direction of your own choosing . People are free because they can do that . Everyone's circumstances are different , but no matter how small the choice , at the very least , you can throw yourself . It's not < PROPMALE > or fate . It's the choice you made . \
