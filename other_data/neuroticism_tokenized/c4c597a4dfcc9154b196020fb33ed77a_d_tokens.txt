In the original Pokémon Red/Blue , when you encounter your rival in Lavender Town , he asks whether or not you know what it's like to have one of your Pokémon die . At this point in the game , he no longer has his Raticate that he used in previous battles . 
Wait a second Doc . You're telling me ... that the future Biff went back in time to the old Biff .. and has the almanac ? PRECISELY < PROPFIRST > !

I have to be honest , at first I hated this Portfolio project . But , after seeing it come together , I'm really proud of what I made . 
UGH MR . LEAR SCIENCE HOMEWORK YOU'RE WELCOME GOOD NIGHT SWEET < PROPMALE > 
I love how my alarm has failed to go off for the second day in a row . 
< PROPFIRST > RUINED MY DAY BAWWWWWWWW 
Going to see Iron Man 2 with < PROPFIRST > tonight . \ 
Didn't really plan to , but seems like it might be good . 
I hate when apps make me feel hypocritical :/ 
Inside your copy of Skate 3 , you get a card that you use to activate all of your sharing capabilities . It's supposed to combat Used Game Sales . \ 
I'm all for not letting businesses fail , but this is kinda sad . Not that it's really a problem for me , I'm buying it new anyways . 
So , Iron Man 2 was pretty good . I like how it was comedic , but it was underplayed . It most certainly didn't overshadow anything . It was clichéd in a few ways , but they weren't badly done clichés . The ending seemed a little abrupt , but was worthwhile . Most certainly the best Superhero movie I've seen since Spiderman 2 . 3 was awful , and this is most certainly better than that crappy Dark Night movie . 
Ugh , modern Music stations SUCK 
So we left a Little Ceasar's Pizza in the Oven with it turned off for about 4-5 days . \ 
As it turns out , this causes it to become both extremely fuzzy , and grow green and blue fungus . \

Good grade all the same , at least . Hopefully I'll be able to bring it back up to a good A now . 
Great job to everyone with Footloose . It was great ! 
Am I really the only one that liked the Dr. Strangelove film in Sanuik's class ?
