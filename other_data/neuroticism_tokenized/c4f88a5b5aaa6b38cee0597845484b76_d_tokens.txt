People never really change , they just finally decide to grow up . <3 
I\ 
believe in Jesus Christ . One of my facebook friends challenged all\ 
believers to put this on their wall ... In the Bible it says , if you deny\ 
me in front of your peers , I will deny you in front of my father , at\ 
the Gates of Heaven . This is a simple test . If you love God you are not\ 
afraid to show it , repost this . 
Lifes a bitch , now die for her ~ lil < PROPMALE > baby ! 
About to go to hacienda for MY BIRTHDAY yay !!!!! :) leave me stuff !

Post this as your status to see what people love about you .! \ I love your ________ . \ " ( : " 
October is Cancerawareness month : In memory of every cancer patient , family member orfriend who has lost their battle with cancer and in honor of those whocontinue to conquer it ! Put this up for 1 hour if you love someone whohas or had cancer . I love you aunt < PROPFEMALE > <3 
Life isn't about waiting for the storm to pass , It's about learning to dance in the rain <3 
I love < PROPFIRST > wood !! <3 
Lifes a bitch , now die for her ~ lil Weezy 
Difficult times have helped me to understand better than before , how infinitely < PROPMALE > and beautiful life is in every way , and that so many things that ppl worry about are of no importance whatsoever .. 
Pleaseput this in your status if you know or LOVE someone who is gay . My wishfor 2010 and beyond is that people will understand that being gay is neither a disease nor a choice . People who are gay are not looking for acure but ACCEPTANCE and EQUAL RIGHTS . 93% won't copy and paste this . Will you make it your status for at least one hour ? Promote LOVE and Acceptance , NOT Hate ! 
confidence is a stain they cant wipe off ~ lil < PROPMALE > 
had a very shitty day ! :/ 
I dont understand why ppl seem to think you cant have more then one best friend , its time for them to grow up and face the fact that you cant give up and run from everything ! 
In a much better mood thanks to my mom :) I love you !! 
\never take anyone for granted because one day you'll wake up and realise that that you've lost a < PROPFEMALE > while you were too bsy searching for a stone ?  " 
HONEST if you like me , Like this status . If you think I'm cute put a ;) . If you love me put a ?. If I'm your friend put a =D . If you miss me put a :/ . If youre brave enough post this as your status . 
I had lots of fun at the choir concert , I feel so happy <3

good night everyone :) 
Last night was pretty crazy , < PROPFIRST>'s going home in a bit and i have hmwk to get done . Party's over :/ lol 
No love , no friendship , can cross the path of our < PROPFEMALE > without leaving some < PROPFIRST > on it forever . <3 
There's this place in me where your finger tips still rest ... your kisses still linger and your whispers softly < PROPFEMALE > ... It's the place where a part of you will forever be a part of me . :/ 
I had a dream and it was about you ... I smiled and recalled the memories we had ... then I noticed a tear fell from my eyes ... you know why ? Coz in my dream you kissed me and said goodbye ... <3 :/ 
I'm not supposed to love you , I'm not supposed to care , I'm not supposed to live my life wishing you were there . I'm not supposed to wonder where you are or what you're doing , but I can't help it , cause I'm in love with you . 
Everyone tells me I should forget about you , you don't deserve me . They're right you don't deserve me , but I deserve you . <3 :/ 
Put this as your status if you know someone who suffers from being a Notre Dame Fan . Being a Notre Dame fan is a real disorder and should be taken seriously . There is still no known cure for NDF and sympathy does not help , but we can raise awareness . 100% of Michigan fans will repost this , simply because WE know how to play football without using the excuse \i can't see out of my eye ! \ " & we beat Notre Dame this year . " 
Shower then bed !! (: Night bestie ! <3

Post this onyour wall if you appreciate your mom ! My Mom is the 
My Mom is the best !!! 
\A true friend reaches for your hand and touches your heart . \ " <3 Thank God for my two very best friends !! < PROPFIRST > wood and < PROPFIRST > Bata (: " 
Coming home today . I miss my besties :/ i hope i dont have to go two more days without seeing them ! 
Going to rake the back yard yay ! :( 
Atrue friend doesn't care when you're broke , what you weigh , what namebrand you wear , if your house is a mess , where you live , about yourpast , or if your family is filled with Crazies , they love you for whoyou are . A true friend can go long periods of time without speaking but ... never question the friendship . Re-post this if you have aleast one truefriend , they will know who they are ! 
I miss the days when tying my shoe was the hardest thing to do Now its learning how to smile when everything inside tells me to cry .

Sometimes , you have to stop caring\ 
You have to turn off all emotion \ 
to protect yourself from getting hurt . you\ 
Have to stop caring about what other people\ 
Think of you & sometimes\ 
You have to hide it all not let anyone\ 
Know how you feel or what you think \ 
You have to put a smile on your face\ 
Pretend everything is fine . Even when\ 
Its not .. sometimes that's the only way to\ 
Save yourself from a broken heart <3

Rain , Rain go away thats what all my haters say . 
Your living is determined not so much by what life brings to you as by the attitude you bring to life ; not so much by what happens to you as by the way your mind looks at what happens . \ 
Circumstances and situations do color life but you have been given the mind to choose what the color shall be <3
