A politician sees his family everyday ; a deployed soldier once in 6 \ 
months . A politician flies 1st class ; a soldier flies in a C130 . A \ 
politician's pension is not reduced ; a soldier's is clawed 65% . A \ 
politician enjoys an expense account ; a soldier must justify extra \ 
rations . A politician vows to defend their country ; a soldier actually \ 
keeps that promise . Re-post if you support our troops ! 
\I pray you'll be our eyes\ 
Oh , if people could hear my crackly voice right now ... The honors go to you , Mr. Sore Throat , heehee ( or maybe in my crackly voice , \heehee\ " would sound more like \ " eghhhh \")" 
\Don't give up\ 
A Veteran is someone , who at one point in their life , wrote a blank check payable to the United States of < PROPFEMALE > for an amount up to , and including , their life . That is beyond honor , and there are way too many people in this country who no longer remember that fact . [ Copy and paste this as your status if you are a Veteran , know a Veteran , Love a Veteran , Support the Troops !!! ] 
\I don't wanna be adored\ 
I'm thankful for life - ' cause without it , I wouldn't be able to enjoy all of the other blessings !

I Believe in Jesus Christ and have accepted Him as my personal Savior . One facebooker has challenged all believers to put this on their wall . In the Bible it says , if you deny me in front of your peers , I will deny you in front of my Father at the Gates of Heaven . This is simple . If you love God and you are not afraid to show it , re-post . 
Maaan ! Why can't some nice dude give me a key like in Millennium Actress ? I shall now pout . 3 = 
\Alas 
I'm sorry , Mr. Cold Sore , I realize you want to be friends ... ( ie ., take over my largest organ ) but ... I think this might work best as a long-distance relationship ... I know this is difficult . \

Women came out of a man’s ribs . Not from his feet to be walked on , not from his head to be superior , but from his side to be equal , under the arm to be protected , and next to the heart to be loved . <3 <3 <3 
\What strange creatures brothers are ! \ " \ 
St. < PROPFIRST > would be sad indeed to see his holiday overrun by all the lovey-doveys X3 
My < PROPFIRST > was my < PROPFEMALE > ! ;3 
\All women become like their mothers . That is their tragedy . No man does . That's his . \ " \ 
Would like about a bazillion kitties for her old age ... 
Tangled is cute-awesome-ous !! Disney : high-five . Make more movies like this one . No more stupid ones . Please . =3 
I'd just like to say < PROPFEMALE > is THE best country in the world !!! = D 
Hmm ... our kitten , Sugar , is quite resourceful : in our house we have a rectangular fan that fits our window , and this window connects both our kitchen and side room ; she currently lives in the side room , which has a glass sliding door that cuts it off from the other rooms . She's small enough to fit through a slot in the side of the fan . She pushes her way through = freedom and snackage . \ 
Kitties find a way . 
Ehehehe , it's good being < PROPFEMALE > ;3 
Just watched Seven Pounds ; I think I'm going to wrap myself in a blankie and go cry ... = ' ( That movie is a good kind of sad . 
I , um , got Black Ops today ... hi ; I'm a sort of fan of COD ... since COD 4 . Yeah . I've decided to make this post quite mellow and a little long . So that's why . Yeah , it's kinda cool . Meh . 
I want to wear a kimono to the prom if I go ^ ^ That way , I'll totally stand out and will not be forced to dance . 
Off to garage sales - why else would I be up this early ? ;3 
\I've had it with you and your emotional constipation ! \""
