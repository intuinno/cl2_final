No one and no thing can tell me who to be , who to love , how to live , or how to act . 

Illness , illness go away come again some other day ... preferably during Spanish class .... 
I hate Sundays . . . mainly because they always lead to Mondays . 
Why are people ( myself included ) so stubborn ? 
I hate it when people say something mean to you , and when you honest to God don't hear it , they mock you and are too chicken to say it again to your face ( much like a certain couple of people I have the misfortune of knowing ) 
If only some people knew how to dress themselves , then my eyes wouldn't be burned with a certain image .... yeah , I'm talking about what happened in spanish . 
SOOOOO excited for < PROPFIRST > Hood tomorrow !! Can't wait ! Good Luck to everyone in it ( including myself ) and all the set crew ( you guys rock , literally ) and can't wait to see everyone who's going to watch ! =D 
I'm so tired - I fell asleep almost as soon as I came home from strike ...., gosh , I don't know what I'm gonna do now that the play is over ..... I guess I'll just have to get ready for the musical !! 
I'm so ready for this whole < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > section to be over ... I mean , we all know what happens in the end ... and the other stuff in between is just filler for an otherwise good story . 
This is my hat , there are many like it , but this is mine/ 
I'm sad today . I don't know why , but I am . :( 
I can't hear a thing on the radio , I can't see a thing in the video , in stereo in the Static Age ( Static Age , Green Day )

I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired . And no , I'm not just quoting that White Tie Affair song . :( 
I hate being sick . And the worst part about it is that it's a freakin ' virus and I can't do anything about it . :( 
I don't know what I'm doing anymore . I feel like crap and I'm tired , being in pain all the time really sucks . I just want to get this week and next week over with already .

If all the snow flakes were lemon drops and gum drops oh , what a sugar rush we would get . 
There's nothing worse than waking up and realizing your late for something , except , of course , you waking up and rushing to leave , only find out that thing was moved to next week . 
Everything seems possible , and nothing is as it seems ..... Godspell auditions tomorrow : nervous . :P

All the times that I cried / All this wastin It's all inside / And I feel all this pain / Stuffed it down / It's back again / And I lie here in bed / All alone / I cant mend but I feel / Tomorrow will be okay 
I know how to talk , I know you , but I don't know how to talk to you . :/ I have no one to go to the winter dance with . :( 
Paperclips and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE>'s . Talk to me unspoken thoughts . I'll keep your secret , I'll keep it safe , I'll keep it hidden , I'll keep it in faith . 
I think I messed up my ankle after dance last night , it hurts really bad . :[ 
I'm not going to worry about what tomorrow brings : just that today I had great friends , great family , good french fries , and smiles that last a life time .

This is the weirdest day ever ..... I love it . 
SOME people fight , and SOME people love , and then you get SOME people like ME who love to fight and will fight for love . 
I hate chopping onions because they make me cry , and when I cry I have to watch a horror movie to make me feel better again ... that's why I can't watch sad disney movies like Dumbo or < PROPFEMALE > - they're just too sad . :( 
I don't want to go to school tomorrow ... I don't want to have to wake up early in the morning ... I don't want to have to look at you across the room ... And know you'll never see me .... I don't want to go to school tomorrow .... I just want to cry . 
Wait , you were talking to me ? Oh , riiiiiggghhhhtttt . Yeah , I was too busy watching an awesome youtube video of two of my classmates pretending to be < PROPFIRST > mays . :]

You're the only person who makes my stomach flip when I see you , and when you talk to me I have to speak slowly so that my excitement doesn't overwhelm me .

Why do people look at me like I did something stupid and then make me laugh ? * coughblakespellacycough * 
i hate being sick 
I know I'm sick ... but it's probably just a bad cold . My parents , however are convinced it is PDSD ... post DRAMATIC stress disorder !! 
Somehow in the process of trying to figure myself out , and find out who I'm suppossed to be in the future , I lost sight of who I am today , and how I'm going to make that person the me I'm going to be . . . . eventually . 
I'm sick of all these little girls who say the \love\ " < PROPFIRST > Beiber when he's just a little girl too . "

Saw Children of < PROPFEMALE > with Rosey tonight - was good . Finally met someone who makes a better God than < PROPFIRST > Spellacy , and yes I did just say that there is someone better than < PROPFIRST > Spellacy and he goes to St. < PROPFIRST > .

SCHOOL IS OFFICIALLY OVER - Now people won't look at me funny when I say I hate freshman . Now , they'll look at me funny when I say I hate sophomores . 
I'm the kind of person who bursts out laughing in dead silence because of something that happend the day before . 
I'm beginning to come to terms with why I hate people so much : I realized it's not that I truly hate people , I just hate idiots , and unfortunately for the majority of the population I have the right to say that I hate them - and freshmen . :D 
Ok , so I put my iPod on random and it started playing Godspell songs , and the first thing I thought when \Bless the Lord\ " came on was I WANNA HEAR < PROPFEMALE > SING IT !! " 
I'm sick of vampires . Why can't people become obsessed with zombies , something I actually like ?

There was a really bad accident on my street tonight . I got really scared for all the people who were in those cars . Some guys were fighting in the street and one of them pulled a gun .

I'm sick , still , and I'm going to miss homecoming , the Italian festival , and the leadership thing for drama ..... being sick sucks . 
Kinda wish it was Monday already , sad as that sounds . 
If you can't convince them , confuse them . 
Life isn't passing me by .... It's trying to run me over . 
Life : you'll never make it out alive . 
I may be a dork , but I'm the coolest dork you'll ever meet .

Smile ; it makes people wonder what you're up to . 
If two wrongs don't make a right , try three . 
Abstract < PROPMALE > and good song lyrics go together like peanut butter and margarine . ( I don't really like jelly ) 
\Nothing takes the taste out of peanut butter like unrequited love . \ " . . . what is it with me and peanut butter nowadays ? " 
Oh , how wrong we were to think that immortality meant never dying . 
Break another little piece of my heart . 
I spend my time with strangers , a condition and it's terminal . 
How I wish you could see the potential , the potential of you and me . Like a book elegantly bound but in a language that you can't read just yet . You've gotta spend some time love , you've gotta spend some time with me . And I know that you'll find love I will possess your heart . 
So ..... what do sweet and sour life savers , gummy worms , ring pops and plastic handcuffs have in common ??? I DON'T KNOW EITHER . 
I am not afraid to keep on living . I am not afraid to walk this world alone . < PROPFEMALE > , if you stay I'll be forgiven . Nothing you can say can stop me going home . 
Sometimes I pretend to be normal ... but then I get bored and go back to being me . ***^_^*** I know it's been a week since the dress rehearsal , but I still can't figure out what I'm supposed to be doing with these handcuffs I got as my drama < PROPMALE > gift . Shia Hill , any suggestions ? 
It's kinda like having a song stuck in your head - a really adorable song that won't seem to go away - but when it goes away you suddenly miss it . I'm suddenly missing that weird song . 
I don't know what it means to be in love , but I know what it means to love someone . I don't know what it's like to hold hands with that special someone , but I've held the hands of people who are special to me . There are a lot of things about love that I don't know , but of all the things I do know is how to love . Show someone you love them right now . \

Your standing at a crossroads in the middle of nowhere . To you back there's the city your from . To your left there's the open road , you don't know where it goes . To your right there's an empty street . You've been down that road . You know what's at the end . And straight ahead is the setting sun , crowned in orange and red rays that reach to all edges of the horizon . Make a choice . It's your move . \

Facebook , I hate you . 
I love you . . . and I wish it was enough . 
There are somethings even music can't cure . . . 
Just to for warn you all , I'm gonna take over the world . So . . . If you're not with me , you're against me , and I will ship you off to Canada . 
Lizzy Noneya I believe you are interchangeable . :D 
Glad to have exams done and over with :D Rest of the year here I come ! 
I refuse to change for anyone but myself . If you can't take me the way I am , then you need to examine yourself . I won't be brought down by who I used to be , or who you want me to be . I am proud to be myself - loud , a little oblivious , and probably a touch schizophrenic . And to all the Nay-Sayers in the world I say , \FUCK YOU ! \"" 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas :D 
i feel like writing in capital letters . . . 
I'm just an Eowyn , chasing after Aragorn , longing for my Faramir . \ 
Wow , what is with my LotR statuses these days ? 
I've been walking down the up emotional escalator . 
No matter where you go , there you are .... remember that . :D 
\No day but today . \ " . . . Rent always makes me cry . T.T " 
I don't know much about love , but I know it shouldn't hurt this way . 
Smiling like it doesn't hurt . Laughing like I don't really care . Meeting your eyes and not crying . Yeah , I'm super talented . 
The < PROPMALE > is giving a ball . Did you hear me ? I SAID THE < PROPMALE > IS GIVING A FREAKING BALL ! THE FREAKING < PROPMALE > IS GIVING A FREAKING BALL ! WE ONLY SANG THAT LIKE SEVEN THOUSAND TIMES ! . . . soooo , what's new with you ? 
All we can do is forgive the past , live for the moment , and hope for the future because nothing in this world is certain , and life is too short to waste dwelling on the past , or predicting the future . All things come to those with < PROPFEMALE > , and open hearts , understanding and open minds . Because you just don't know what the next second is going to bring . \

< PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > I love you , you make my life complete with randomness :D 
Here it’s safe , and here it’s warm\ 
Here the daisies guard you from every harm\ 
Here your dreams are sweet–\

Here is the place where I love you . \

If it weren't for the laws of physics and law enforcement I'd be unstoppable . 
I have no special talents - I'm only passionately curious . 
I am strumming the strings of the universe , thusly . 
Today I was happier than a bird with a french fry , - part of that was because I had french fries - and because I saw my awesome friends < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > and Lizzy Noneya and watched Repo ! The Genetic Opera . I was already having a better day and they just made it better ! I love you guys ! :D 
You can only be young once , but you can be immature for a lifetime :) 
\In another life I see you . As an angel flying high . And the hands of time will free you - you will cast your chains aside . And the < PROPFEMALE > will come and kiss away ever tear that's ever fallen from your eyes - behind those eyes I wonder ... \"" 
Sometimes I think it would be better if I didn't know how to use a computer . 
I may forgive and forget - but I keep a list of names . 
I really don't want to realize what I think I just realized .... 
Life is too ugly to dance with short men ...... wait ... scratch that , reverse it . 
It's getting close to midnight and I feel like punching someone's face . . . I consider this a small victory - it's been a while since I've felt this normal .

It's easy to tell someone to let something go , in fact it's easy to tell yourself that you're going to let it go ; but no one tells you how hard it really is to actually let that thing go - especially when you've become so attached .

Facebook challenge ... During this couple of weeks before Easter , I am out to prove that my friends will repost , I hope I am right !!! Easter is not about bunnies and chocolate eggs . Let's lift up God's name and make a statement !! When Jesus died on the cross he was thinking of You and Me . If you are not ashamed to call Jesus Christ your Savior , copy and repost . I'm not ashamed ! 
I like being misunderstood , it gives me a sense of accomplishment . 
A little more than nothing was all I could hope for \ 
When love is just a moment passing by\ 
No words were needed to describe \ 
The fleeting look in your eyes . \ 
It's not the moments you live for , it's the moments you live in . It's not the breaths you take , it's the breaths you catch . It's not the path you walk , it's the path you take . It's telling a complete and total stranger that they're loved . You are loved . No matter what you believe , who you love , or where you're from , YOU ARE LOVED . Spread the message of love to your friends : I love you for you . 
I am a Whovian , your argument is invalid . \ 
Why ? Because you don't even know what a Whovian is , that's why . 
\I am the droid you're looking for . Love me and despair . \"" 
I'm giving up on trying to post decent , meaningful , and intriguing statuses . No one really reads them anyway - what's the point ? 
No , it's not weird at all that I'm listening to Oasis at 12:40 something at night . . . nor is it weird that I'm suddenly feeling very relaxed and wanting to fall asleep .... maybe that's just the effect of Oasis - scratch that , I know it is . 
Doctor Who ? You exploded my mind - and I didn't even see the whole episode . \ 
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo .................. 
Can it be Saturday yet ? Doctor Who ??? 
Am I the only one who thinks < PROPMALE > Mumford is a total babe ? . . . Most likely . 
It's that time of day when I want to throw something at < PROPFIRST > Moffat for writing the Impossible Astronaut . 
IT'S SATURDAY IT'S SATURDAY IT'S SATURDAY IT'S SATURDAY !!! Do you know what this means ? * uh , it's Saturday ? * No silly head , DOCTOR WHO !! ** does happy dance **
