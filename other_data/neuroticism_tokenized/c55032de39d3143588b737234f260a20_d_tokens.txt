Creep by radiohead is the best song ever 
I love how just how fickle some people are . One minute they're your friend , the next minute , they've forgotten about you 
Following the rights movement you clamped on with your iron fist , drugs became conveniently available for all the kids 
When you were here before , \ 
Couldn't look you in the eye\ 
You're just like an angel , \ 
Your skin makes me cry\ 
\ 
You float like a feather\ 
In a beautiful world\ 
I wish I was special\ 
You're so fuckin ' special 
Wants to go play tennis 
In every life we have some trouble , but when we worry we make it double don't worry , be happy :)

Dear 15 year old emo kids of the internet : You are NOT Japanese . Stop acting like it . 
After getting very bored , has came to the conclusion that Hitler didn't kill himself , and that our next president will be just like < PROPFEMALE > . 
Is officially pulling an all nighter . Gonna kick back with my small bottle of smirnoff , smoke a pack of Camels , listen to Mad season , and try to figure out why I am so unhappy with life in general . 
Wishes I was going back to Stone tomorrow to start all over again as a freshman . If I only knew back then what I know now ..... 
Hangin round . Downtown by myself and Iv had too much time , to set down and think about myself then there sge was . 
You are the antidote that gets me by . Something strong like a drug that gets me high . 
And if there were a God , I think it very unlikely that He would have such an uneasy vanity as to be offended by those who doubt His existence . 
Down in a hole and I don't know if I can be saved . See my heart I decorate it like a grave . You don't understand who they thought I was supposed to be . Look at me now im a man who won't let himself be . 
Hates it when people say that Wikipedia isn't a reliable source of information without ANY proof to back it up . 
Brother will kill brother , spilling blood across the land . Killing for religion , something I don't understand . Fools like me , go across the sea , and go to foriegn lands . Ask the sheep if they believe that you kill on gods command .

Something in her smile that shows . That I don't need no other lover :) 
I used to know you when we were young .. You were in all my dreams . 
I want your ugly , I want your disease , I want you open mouthed and down on your knees I want your love :D . lol 
Life is a tragedy for those who feel , and a comedy for those who think . 
After learning everything there is to learn about it , im finally going to attempt to build a Tesla Coil . 
Getting my tattoo tomorrow hopefully . 
Watched < PROPFIRST > Beck's \restoring honor\ " speech . Reminded me of the Nuremberg Rallies . " 
I am not afraid of death . The way I see it , I was dead billions of years before I was born and it didn't inconvenience me in the slightest . - < PROPFIRST > Twain

Rush id the most under rated band of all time . That is all .

Just realized that < PROPFIRST > Paine was a Marxist 
A modern-day warrior mean mean stride , today's < PROPMALE > Sawyer mean mean pride . 
Is stoked about Jackass 3 . 
As soon as you're born they make you feel small . By giving you know time instead of it all . Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all .

Listening to some Shostakovich sypmphony No . 5 . Waiting for my imported Honduran Robusto Cigars to get here . 
Super depressed right now . . . . more than I have been in awhile 
< PROPMALE > Stalin was once nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize . That is just epic . 
Ugh . Been couped up in Crossvegas for far to long . I want to travel to another country , but where to go ? 
Easy A is very good movie . 
When I grow up I want to be , One of the harvesters of the sea . I think before my days are done , I want to be a Fisherman .

I refuse to celebrate a holiday that pays respect to a murdering pedophile . Therefore , im going to work . 
So apparently today is national comming out day . Nothing wrong with that , but why wasnt it yesterday or tomorrow ? Was it purposely planned to be on < PROPMALE > day ? Oh well . Who better to have their holiday taken from them than < PROPMALE > . 
Piove troppo .... 
Fighting for peace is like screwing for virginity 
Is God willing to prevent evil , but not able ? \ 
Then he is not omnipotent . \ 
Is he able , but not willing ? \ 
Then he is malevolent . \ 
Is he both able and willing ? \ 
Then why does evil exist ? \ 
Is he neither able nor willing ? \ 
Then why call him God ? 
Even castles made of sand fall into the sea , eventually . 
So this is the first time iv stayed awake for an entire 24hr period ... Not one of my best ideas . 
Elections today . Like it even matters . All politicians work for their corporate masters ( im looking at you GoldmanSachs ) , and that will never change . You can be spoon fed Red vs Blue , Liberal vs . conservative propaganda all you want , but if you have any basic understanding of the world of politics , you know its all the same . 
Prop 19 . wasn't voted in . Feels bad man . 
Remember remember the 5th of November the Gunpowder treason and Plot . I have not no reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot . 
There are impossible dreams , there are no invisible seams . Each night when the day is through , I don't ask much , I just want you . 
Snow isn't as exciting now that it dosent get me out of school . In fact , I kind of hate it . 
Fallout New Vegas . hmmmm . Who to side with ? 
Down in a Hole and I dont know if I can be saved . See my heart I decorate it like a grave . 
Imagine theres no countries . It isn't hard to do . Nothing to kill or die for . And no religion too . Imagine all the people living life in peace . 
< PROPFIRST > the Octopus died ? What the hell ??!! D: 
Your fallout 3 character is so stupid he failed the G.O.A.T. test . 
Germany , Austria and Italy are standing together in the middle of a pub when Serbia bumps into Austria and spills Austria's pint . Austria demands Serbia buy it a complete new suit because there are splashes on its trouser leg . Germany expresses its support for Austria's point of view . Britain recommends that everyone calm down a bit . 
Just wrote and published 2 notes . Hopefully people won't be too lazy to read them . 
Whats my drug of choice ? Well what have you got ? I don't go broke , and I do it alot . 
Im going to make a website dedicated to exposing the true identity of Cardboard Box 
One day , good music will make a comeback . Rather than a band's talent being equated with how much eyeliner they can wear .

Fly me to the < PROPFEMALE > , let me play among the stars . Let me see what Spring is like on-a Jupiter and Mars . 
An Intelligent hell would be better that a stupid paradise . 
Saw Mr. Kemmer at Cracker Barrel . Completely epic day . 
I don't mind the sun sometimes , the images it shows . I can taste you on my lips and smell you on my clothes . Cinnamon and sugery and softly spoken lies . You never know just how you look though other peoples eyes . 
Mr. Corwley , what went down in your head ? Mr. Crowley , did you talk to the dead ? Your lifestyle to me seems so tragic , but the thrill of it all . You fooled all the people with magic , and you waited on Satan's call . 
In the days of my youth I was told what it means to be a man . Now iv reached that age I try to do all those things the best I can . 
Is not liking this new and foregin thing called , being awake before 9:00 
Times have changed , and times are strange , here I come but I ain't the same . 
FINALLY we have a white Christmas . 
We try to aviod life threatening risks , so we can make it safely to death ? 
New Years < PROPFEMALE > . It's gonna be quite a night ;)

The Jets are getting raped . GO STEELERS ! 
Here's to hoping that the people who need to win this revolution in Egypt come out on top =/\ 
\No revolution is worth anything unless it can defend itself . \ " - Vladimir Lenin " 
God I am increadibly bored . I need something to do :| 
Stupid Packers >:| . The Steelers represent the proliteriat , thus being superior weather they have another super bowl under their belt or not :( 
My body aches from mistakes , Betrayed by lust . 
Life is not an easy matter ... You cannot live through it without falling into frustration and cynicism unless you have before you a great idea which raises you above personal misery , above weakness , above all kinds of perfidy and baseness . \

Anyone know anything about that huge wreck near the Crab Orchard exit on the Interstate ? 
President Mubarack is gone !!! Yes !!!!!! Another American puppet regime collapses ! \

Some guy did a Judas Priest song last night on < PROPFEMALE > Idol . Epic win . 
Is so bored . Someone talk to me :| 
“Life is a tsunami . And I’ve been riding it on a mercury surfboard . ”\ 
- < PROPFIRST > Sheen 
Looks like the anti-union < PROPMALE > passed in Wisconsin . Nothing but union busting , plain and simple . What is a union without collective bargaining rights ? Politicians ( I won't say JUST republicans , because thats not fair ) have a track record of doing stupid crap , but this takes the cake . 
How many drugs did < PROPFIRST > Sheen take ? Enough to kill 2 and a half men . 
To everyone who wished me a happy B-day , thank you very much . Things like that mean alot to a person . :) 
Gettin ' down on Fridayyyy !
