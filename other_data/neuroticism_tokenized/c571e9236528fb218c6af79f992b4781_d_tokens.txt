bleh . 

Might just run away to Canada 
I don't know what happened with that stupid quiz . 
Why do I fail completely at Facebook ? 
\I hope I can talk to you later because now is the worst time possible . \"" 
Wants you to know that he's leaving . 
Good day . So far I like all my teachers , and my classes . Maybe I was right when I said this would be my year :D 
Is typing out his awesome story ... But it's on his myspace blog ... Check it out yourself , or wait a couple weeks until I type it all out and put it here . 
Niles < PROPMALE > is a whore . And he knows it . Oh , and his name is Apricot . But you have to pronounce it app-ri-cott 
Ah , I can't concentrate . My brain is turning to mush . 
remembers the days when reading was enjoyable because it was for entertainment , not for making you hate books . 
Niles < PROPMALE > is a dumb , ignorant fool . But he is completely right about the fact that AID's had jizz on his pants . 
< PROPMALE > Yoshikawa is a beast when it comes to hardcore , back to back , zombie killing . I know from personal experience . 
Ugh ... I just got my grade up to an A in Limonoff and here I forgot to do two assignments and everybody knows I totally fail at term papers . Pwned . :( 
Niles < PROPMALE > is still a whore . He even said so yesterday . 
I'm a hardcore plagerizzer . 
And tomorrow ? Tomorrow we conquer the rest of the world . 
Who is to tell you that our last goodbye is to be a sad one ? You should laugh in their face for we will laugh together . 
I got to have nap-time today ! 
believes he should invest more time with the Flying Spaghetti Monster . RAmen 
My life feels like a series of dreams these days . 
Pondering , always pondering ... 
Do not question my incompetence . It highly surpasses your greatness . 
Would you mind terribly if I stopped thinking for a while ? 
I have to say ... I love my friends . Though I do realize some things I need to work on , this year is sure to be excellent . 
I need to find something to do today . 
I wish we didn't have to read giant steaming piles of shit for books sometimes . 
The Spoon Split ... That's right . xD 
One of these days I'm going to pass out in class and nobody will be able to wake me up for a while . 
Wants to know if he can become a fan of becoming a fan ... 
Some lady at community service called me ' Avatar ' today because I was tall and my \team color\ " was blue . Is that a fail or a win ? " 
So not going to Spanish tomorrow . Power keeps flickering . Hm ... Trouble is brewing ... 
A lot a lot a lot of happy birthdays . Thank you so much you guys . It means a lot , even if Facebook is the one telling you . 
Did Pastor < PROPMALE > Hindenburg send anybody else a friend request ? I am a little confused by it ... 
\You're a prize ! \"" 
I want to say two things . First , and most importantly THEY ARE MAKING A MOVIE BASED ON IT'S KIND OF A FUNNY STORY ?!?!?!?!?! I wish they wouldn't ... It better be good ... Second , I am highly skilled at procrastinating . 
Somebody should tell me how to make fan pages so I can make one called \Bryan Kenjiro Yoshikawa is a noob . \"" 
Fuck . This . Shit . 
So tired ... Going to be even more tired ... When will it end ? It's a good thing tomorrow is going to be amazing !!!! 
I just looked at my chat thing on Facebook and it looks like pretty much all my friends are online . I wonder what that means ... 
So uh ... I have the interview done but I haven't written any of these before . How exactly do I do the paper part of the Civil Rights Interview for Limonoff ? 
Part of me wishes I could get the Fiddler On the Roof songs out of my head , but a larger part of me really likes them and repeats them . 
Can I go to sleep now ? Homework says no , body says yes . \ 
Decisions decisions ... 
I DON'T GET IT , I SEE A BIKE !!! 
Well . I was going to go to bed early , then I saw a little bit of Grey's Anatomy ... Can I say , that this is EXTREMELY intense ? 
Um ... I'm having a lot of trouble finding enough facts to take up 3 minutes for this stupid project . 
Senior Year :\ 
1 : Aguilar ( Piano Lab)\ 
2 : Griffin ( Psych)\ 
3 : Wong \ 
4 : Perry\ 
5 : Nishizaki ( Calculus AB)\ 
6 : Gluckman ( Chem ) [ I shouldn't be in this though ... So that should change ] 
One of these days , < PROPFEMALE > ... >:( 
Feels like death from your cold icy breath . 
Love is when you feel like you couldn't feel any stronger about somebody any more , and you do every day . Depression is when you feel like you have hit rock bottom , but keep falling further every day . What happens when you mix the two ? 
If they butcher the Walking Dead , so help me I will reign hell on earth and destroy every piece of shit person who took part in it . ALL OF THEM . 
TV commercials suck . It's trying to get me to subscribe to \adult channels\ " and compares women to treats . And cookies . Not cool ... \ 
You're the sun in my < PROPFEMALE > life that causes the rainbow to show up in my heart . 
Guess what ? BRACES OFF 
Like this status and I will tell some stuff \ 
about what I like , dislike , and a confession , and my first impression of\ 
you . ( I'm doing this because Niles did it for me , sorry if it takes a while to get to it , I don't go on fb everyday ) 
\I have Obsessive Cock Disorder . \ " \ " What does that mean ? \ " \ " It means that I have an aggressive < PROPMALE > or something . \ " - < PROPMALE > Yoshikawa " 
I'm the only one up ? That's good . Well . Long day . Good day . Good night ! :D 
It's like when you're doing something mundane and then all of a sudden it hits you and you realize the ultimate truth . So you say to yourself , \I'm way too gangsta for this shit . \"" 
Hey , anybody good with emulators and roms ? I really miss having my SNES and playing games like Crono Trigger and Tetris Attack . I just realized I sound like a total nerd . Any help would be appreciated , thanks ! 
I just saw Ren Stevens/Kim Possible/Christy Carlsen Romano in a show my mom was watching . What the hell happened to her , considering < PROPFIRST > Stevens/Shia Labeouf is so famous now ? They did both start off in Even Stevens ... 
I can't get the lyric \Your sex is on fire\ " out of my head . " 
I fixed the computer in my room with the help of the lap top from the other room . Thank you , technology . 
I have to read all day . For the next couple weeks I think ... \ 
\ 
Except to see < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim !!! Who wants to come see it to make a super-mega-awesome party ? 
Wow . I just realized we're about to be seniors . 
Sometimes I want to just copy someones status , word for word , and see if they notice . 
So I still only found classes with a few people when I looked through facebook , so I'm posting my stuff . \ 
1 . Camera Comp with Cosgrove\ 
2 . Psychology AP with Griffin\ 
3 . Perry\ 
4 . Wong\ 
5 . Calculus with Nishizaki\ 
6 . Office Assistant with Tudesko . \ 
By the way , if the room for office assistant says \LIB\ " does that mean I have it in the library ? Because that would be awesome . " 
Is it wrong to dream about being < PROPMALE > so you can laugh at people who thought you couldn't do anything ? 
I was just forced to listen to , and then decided it might be okay to watch , a < PROPFIRST > Beiber video . You know what I found out ? He sounds JUST LIKE everybody in his genre . Why is everybody bitching that he isn't any good again ? 
I love < PROPMALE > . 
Maybe it's time to forgive and forget ... 
I can't fathom the intensity of the school year yet . It hasn't me just yet . Maybe after the essay tomorrow I will see if I'm prepared ... 
So I need some help . I have library < PROPFEMALE > 6th , and I shouldn't have it , but all of the electives at 6th are apparently filled up . Know where I can transfer into instead ? 
I am making a vow\ 
Right here , right now\ 
To < PROPFEMALE > out with my friends more often . I feel so ... Out of the loop with some of you guys . So , just tell me where and when , and I will do most everything in my power to make it happen . That is a lot of stuff . 
Sometimes , the only cure to life is dreaming of something different . 
I want life to give me some lemons . 
By Monday , I will be completely dead . 
Falling apart at the seams , that's nothing new . \ 
When everybody else falls , what do I do ? 
When I close my eyes I think everything around me is dark with flashing lights and lasers , and expect it to be like that when I open them again . 
is EXCITED !!! 
I want to write a book so amazing that it invokes thought into people everywhere , make high school students analyze it , and then have a press conference and say it was all bullshit and it didn't mean anything . Then flip the cameras off and tell the teachers to stop analyzing literature . 
HELP\ 
So for the ESSAY ... Do we have to talk about all four of the philosophers/philosophies , or can we just talk about three or something ? Because I'm about to have three pages and I only talked about Machiavelli and Locke ... 
Okay ... I should go to bed ... 
Maybe it's better , \ 
Maybe it's not , \ 
But I'd rather try it , \ 
Than stay here and rot . 
Oh sweet Jesus . Such a long day . Such a tiring day . \ 
Such a ... Good day . I'm dead tired , good night . 
I'm wondering if I'm too insane\ 
But wipe your face from all the blame , \ 
It's not your fault , that's not what I'm saying\ 
This new life here just ain't the same . 
My life has a way of kicking me in the face . 
I miss the days of wonder and < PROPFEMALE > . If today were yesterday , tomorrow would seem brilliant . 
I'm making a friend calendar . So ... Yeah . You officially have to set up dates in advance . 
Okay . I think I need to shower and start my homework now . 
This weekend was a total success in the eyes of an Ogre . 
Sleep beckons me ... 
I need to write that book and make a million dollars sometime soon . 
One day my head split open when I tripped and fell\ 
I was shocked and scared and started to yell , \ 
until I found out it was empty all along . 
Have you ever hit a point in your life where it became a countdown ? 
Chk-chk . Bwrhhhh . 
Rain , rain , you're here to stay\ 
I don't care what others say ... 
I . \ 
Love . \ 
My . \ 
Life . 
Every person has 1000 wishes . a cancer patientonly has one : to get better . i know that 97% will not post this as their status , but i know that my friends will be one of the 3% and put this as their status , at least for an hour , in honor of those who died because of cancer or are still fighting ... 
We would have had some fun\ 
But it seems we're on the run\ 
But you can't run from the sun\ 
So in the end we'll be well done . 
When the river runs blue , \ 
then I will run too . \ 
When the river runs read\ 
It's not from our dead . \ 
And when the river runs black , \ 
it's because your heart lacks\ 
The truth . 
I dressed up like an ogre . :D 
And as he spoke softly and calmly , the world around him fell to chaos . 
QUICK , somebody give me a name for a protagonist ! I was going to use < PROPMALE > for my main character but I decided not to write a story about him ! 
The time for sleep is now . 
Please\ 
put this as your status if you know or are related to someone who was \ 
killed in Hogwarts when it was under siege by the Death Eaters during the\ 
Second Wizarding War . The Order brings unity , but the Death Eaters \ 
continue to < PROPMALE > division and hatred . Over 50 citizens died in the \ 
terrorist attack against Hogwarts ... 93% of people won't repost this . \ 
Repost this if you support Dumbledore's Army . 
One of these days , < PROPFEMALE > . 
Is there really nothing to do on a Friday night ? 
So uh . Strange weekend . 
My dad forgot to set back his clocks for some reason ... \ 
Surprisingly , I'm not tired . 
Gah . I really need to get my shit together sometimes . 
If I did it again I would do things differently . 
Eternally pondering the perplexities of life . 
And you can't call me nothing but a thug\ 
Cause I drink my apple juice straight from the jug . 
A million little thought-children are running around in my head desperately trying to escape into words and actions but all of them fall short of my decision making wall inside my head , which shuts them all out and tells me to go to bed and think again in the morning . 
What is this Q and A nonsense everybody is talking about ? 
Bed .

So uh . What's up ? 
< PROPMALE > was awesome , as always . \ 
Time for a power nap ...

Mmm . Friendship . 
\It's sicker than pneumonia . \ " - < PROPMALE > Fricke "

Some days are your worst days . Recently , some days have felt more like every day . 
Spiraling down , down , down . \ 
Further still , the journey must go on . \ 
At what day will this \adventure\ " be done ? \ 
When I grow up , I want to be a demi-god , or a Greek hero . My career choice has finally been mapped out . 
< PROPMALE > Miller is a butt-head because now I have to work on my term paper . 
I should probably go to sleep now . I'm tired and I've gotten at least a little done for my paper . Not much , but better than nothing . Sweet dreams . 
I'm tired , and I don't want to go to school anymore . I want to draw and experiment with colors and write poetry all day . This is bull . 
Ah The Deadly Syndrome . Where would I be without Animals Wearing Clothes ? 
Proud creator of a philosophical quote on a bathroom stall . 
I just don't think I'm up to it anymore . 
Fuck this . I'm going to go play Fable . At least the people of Albion appreciate me ... 
So uh . Yeah . Time to sleep or something . 
Most people have 1000 wishes for Christmas ; a cancer patient only has one , to get better . In honor of someone who has died , or\ 
is still fighting , or has survived cancer , copy this to your status . 
I don't know what to write about for another < PROPFEMALE > . This is ridiculous . 
So uh . Life's good . Looking forward to an awesome break . 
I'm going to beast through my Long Form book right now , then I'm going to continue hanging out with my friends for the rest of break . 
< PROPFEMALE > ... Much ... Done ... \ 
This week is great . 
Whoo ... 
I'm finally learning how to play Everlong . Took me long enough ... 
This is a good day . This is a good year . This is a good life . \ 
If it isn't , fix it up and make sure you don't live with strife . \ 
If you want some help , then I'll help you out\ 
Just don't piss around and stomp and pout . \ 
Life is a miracle , so treat it as such . \ 
Your friends are all here , they'll be your best crutch . \ 
But remember not to < PROPFEMALE > a little too long\ 
Because that's using them , and that's just wrong . 
I'm currently hanging out with some crackwhores ... \ 
And I love it . 
I've been up for 25 hours now . I can't decide on what to do next though ... 
Sounds like it storming outside ... Just the way I like it . 
Mm . 8 hours of community service tomorrow . I'm excited . \ 
-.- 
I love google translator . It's helping me with Latin pronunciation . 
I could hold it together for others but not for myself\ 
My mind must be missing because it's not on the shelf . 
Took a couple naps tonight ... I think I might as well read for a little bit . 
I'm done . That's that . No more . 
Okay . Videos are streaming slow on my laptop . Like the are stopping after playing for three seconds , buffering for forever , and then repeating kind of slow . But all of the other computers in my house are running fine and the connection is superb on it . Somebody want to inform me as to what is wrong ? 
This day has been SOOOO long . I feel like it should be midnight right now . 
So . I just wrote a story AND < PROPFIRST > a nice picture tonight . I did a lot . 
Something doesn't feel right ... 
Just got done fisting myself \ 
:) 
I have to admit , chip bag clips on my nipples feels pretty good . 
Man . I don't want to wake up for tomorrow . 
Tired . Sleep . You know . Stuff . 
I must have made a few mistakes because I can't find the right answer to my problems . 
I'm feeling much better . Thank the gods . 
I just had one of those moments where you look at yourself and you say \What am I doing ? \ " and then come to interesting realizations . " 
\Sleep makes it better 
Hm . This was a disheartening experiment . 
La la la la la . 
Today was a day . \ 
Hooray . 
Growing increasingly bitter with every passing day . 
I need to kill a couple of hours ... 
I promise to send something I'll make myself to the first 5 people who leave a comment on this update . They must in turn promise to re-post this as their status . The rules are that the items must be made by you personally and they must be received by your 5 persons in 2011 :) 
My eyes should be on my book , but my fingers are stuck on writing stories ...

Today , I came to the sudden realization that ... \ 
MLIB . 
Meh . 
Today , I < PROPMALE > out with my bro Aidan < PROPFIRST > because he's a boss . The highest level of chill has been achieved ... And I found out that one of my lucky < PROPFIRST > is 69 . My life is bro . 
Woke up and couldn't fall back asleep ... It's 9 ... My brain must still be on school schedule or something . 
I had excellent dreams last night/this morning . 
I'm tempted . Awfully and truly . So close , yet I know better than that , so I must resist . There's always dreaming ... 
< PROPFEMALE > won't stop listening to modern rock\ 
How she hates to be alone . 
I wonder if you wonder . 
I just passed out . 
I've had an intense case of radio all day long . Most of all , I had The Stars - Your Ex Lover is Dead , and Motion City Soundtrack songs . I just tuned in to I'm A Fly by < PROPFIRST > Farren . Good day . 
$50 won from lottery scratchers for my birthday . \ 
Good day , eh ? 
Stop . Take a moment . Breathe . \ 
My life has been this repeated motion , but now I'm going to exhale . \ 
This has to work . 
I got my permit ! \ 
A little late in the game , \ 
But I'm excited all the same . 
I just drove for the first time . 
Bummer . 
Gonna drive ! :D 
Nothing to say . 
Curses . 
Building it up again . 
I feel like \it is what it is\ " is going to be my new saying . " 
I feel like now that I have a free 6th period , I have an extra hour to do more nothing . 
T'was a good day . 
Hey < PROPMALE > Pants , did you paint that picture of the wolf ? 
I'm having a good day . 
I've had Hold Me Down by Motion City Soundtrack stuck in my head for weeks now . I can't stop singing it . It's all I know right now . 
Walked from my mom's house to my dad's house with my best friends . Good day . 
I've figured my life out . It's blissful . 
Just drove stick for the first time ... \ 
Ha . 
And all of a sudden , the dread sets in :\ 
Tomorrow is around the corner , and tomorrow holds nothing new . 
I'm awfully tired . 
Bye . 
My Microsoft Word decided it doesn't want to work anymore . Curse you , computers . 
I'll leave without a trace of sorrow , \ 
Because I'll see you all tomorrow ! 
\I don't believe in pessimism . If something doesn't come up the way you want 
I really wish you would . 
A splendid night , thanks to my boy < PROPMALE > Pants 
Starting with my best foot forward . 
I'm a cockaholic <3 
Fuck Zak . 
Just another day . 
A good day , but a long day . 
I hate it when I try to do math homework and realize I don't know how to do anything . 
Oh Sufjan Stevens , how I adore you so . 
Bleh . All right . Time to read < PROPMALE > until I sleep ... So like for five minutes . 
Whyyyyy . Must I crryyyy ? 
Good days , all around . 
Oh man . Life is good . 
All of us have a thousand wishes . To be thinner , have more money , a new phone . A cancer patient only has one wish , to kick cancer's ass . I know that 97% of you won't post this as your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do . In honor of someone who died , or is FIGHTING cancer , post this for at least one hour 
There was so much loot yesterday . 
I need to avoid my facebook for a bit . I'll keep my phone on . 
I'm tired of a lot of things in this current moment ... But remembering the past two weeks I've had make up for it entirely . 
Disappointing day . \ 
Hollow victory . 
\Mary wanna party ! \"" 
I feel like the old me would ask the new me what the hell happened ... But still I think we know which one is happier . 
I wish i had a normal sized penis :'( 
Jealousy is a horrid bitch . \ 
And made some dormant muscles twitch . 
I have repeated themes for my tea leaves ... I wonder what that means . 
Going to try and rearrange my bedroom . Maybe for more room . I'm having a good day . 
It's good to feel good . 
First home game against < PROPMALE > today at 5 . I wonder how this will go ... 
I'm rediscovering some old music and making some of my own . \ 
Tell me am I right that there could be nothing better ? 
We can fall in love\ 
Or we can fall apart . \ 
No push will come to shove , \ 
I'm ready now to start . 
The < PROPMALE > Browne concert was unbelievably awesome . I might have died and gone to heaven ... 
I just spent the night rearranging my room with my brother . There's so much room for activities . 
I don't think in my entire 18 years of life have I ever been more excited for a Sunday to come than I am right now . 
So ... Yeah . 
I feel so good right now ... Oh man . \ 
Very happy . 
Just another one of those night's , I guess . \ 
Oh well . 
Sometimes , I < PROPFEMALE > back in my chair , turn up my music as loud as possible , and close my eyes . It's good to be distant from reality in that sense . 
Another one of those days I wish I could just sleep forever . God's greatest gift to me was hypersomnia ... 
I'm going to be early tonight . I'm just too tired . 
After a long , stressed out , frustrating week , I get up again to rinse and repeat . 
Truth . \ 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TboOfiTjhU 
Spent . 
Thank gps for friends . 
That was a good way to end the week . 
When I close my eyes , my head starts spinning\ 
Seems that in this life , there is no winning 
\I train with the angels\ 
I wanna know what it's like to be awkward and innocent , not belligerent . I wanna know how it feels to be useful and pertinent and have common sense , yeah . 
I wish I knew , \ 
just what to do , \ 
to fix my life , \ 
and make it new . 
Who wants to go see the new < PROPMALE > Brand movie < PROPFIRST > with me when it comes out ? \ 
< PROPMALE > Yoshikawa < PROPFIRST > Lawson < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Zak Richardson 
Go to your profile . The first 5 people to appear on the sidebar of your friends section are on your team in the upcoming Zombie Apocalypse . How screwed are you ? \ 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > Nichols < PROPFIRST > Namba < PROPFEMALE > Alger < PROPFEMALE > Plesser\ 
It's possible that would not suffice ... 
And when I think about it , \ 
All I want to do is eternally sleep . \ 
But that would just be to quit , \ 
So I continue to fall ... Oh so steep . 
\What is this ? Is there shit in my drink ? What the fuck- is this glitter ? Have I been drinking glitter ? Am I going to have glitter in my poop ? \ " - Zak Richardson " 
Interesting day ... 
I don't know what I'm doing . 
I feel lightweight miserable . I might be sicker than I thought . 
It would be cool to know whether we won today or not ... 
So ... I need to know . Who here is knows of Explosions in the Sky , and wants to learn how to play some of their music ? 
Well . Catching up on two days of work wasn't as bad as I had imagined it would be . \ 
Though just now I realized there's a gap between 4 hours ago and Monday on my \Most Recent\ " news feed ... " 
I was serious the other day about learning to play Explosions in the Sky songs . Anybody ? Please ...? \ 
What about Deadly Syndrome ? I would like to learn how to play them too . 
Since nobody is taking me up on my offer for EitS , I'm going to spend time trying to write a good happy poem , considering it has been decided that poetry is far too depressing . 
Succeeded in creating a happy poem today , and found a band member to play some Explosions with . The epitome of a good day . 
Off to Berkeley . Think I'm coming back in around 8-ish ? Text me if you want to < PROPFEMALE > out later . 
So . The truth be ... 
Life is good with good pals like mine . 
Maybe it was better that I just waited\ 
And thought in the time where I anticipated\ 
Stopped the delusions that I've created\ 
Prevented something I would have initiated . 
If I could , I would kill you , but I made my promise . 
It should mean something . 
Going to sleep very well tonight ... \ 
By the way , I thought Pride and Prejudice was excellent , probably because I actually read the book . Take that ! 
I'm in the mood to actually try and write some music , but I'm so tired at the same time ... I wonder which will I give in to before finishing my homework ... 
Lately , I've had this constant feeling that I should be doing something important , but I can't remember what the important thing is . Oh well . 
Chill night . Long day . Good shit . 
But I'm getting used to it\ 
You have to get used to it
