Just < PROPFEMALE > wrapped my roomate into the shower . Keep in mind we just < PROPFEMALE > wrapped her entire side of the room last week .... :) 
Just walked into our front room which is filled with newspaper and shredded paper a foot high . The creepy part is knowing someone was in my apartment in the middle of the night . Dang < PROPFEMALE > . 
I would say I love Fridays if I didn't have two huge tests today and if I had a ticket to the football game , but I do have two tests and I don't have a ticket ... I don't like Fridays 
I miss everything about you ( but still you're gone ) , I can't believe that I still want you ( after loving you I never should have walked away ) . After all the things we've been through ( I know it's never gonna be the same ) . I miss everything about you . 
Just played guitar for 3 hours in the lounge while watching chick flicks , alone . I'm definitely shooting up the social scale ... 
Inattentive ADD . That explains EVERYthing 
Just had our third funeral service for our dead fishies with my roomies . We are bad mommies . :( 
Off to the lounge ; the only place I can somewhat concentrate . :(

Off to the library . If I'm not back in 5 hours ... please come get me . 
I was in the stall about to go to the bathroom and remembered to take my phone out of my coat pocket so it wouldn't fall in the toilet . As I pulled it out , I apparently didn't have as good of grip on it as I thought and it slipped and fell in . Ironic- that was the precise reason I was taking it out of my pocket . 
I'm breaking at the cracks , and everything goes black . It's another heart attack , and I can't handle that . 
I miss poopface . 
Kennewick ! :)
