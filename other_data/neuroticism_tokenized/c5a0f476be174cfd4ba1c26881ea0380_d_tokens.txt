Change your facebook profile picture to a CARTOON FROM YOUR CHILDHOOD and invite your friends to do the same . Unti Monday there should be no human faces on facebook , but an invasion of memories . This is to raise attention towards VIOLENCE AGAINST CHILDREN . =) 
My tummy hurts ....... >_< really bad .... :'( 
Ugh .... it still hurts ... :'( 
URGENT !!! ) people change your profile pics back to YOU cuz the group that told us all to change our pics to our fav cartoon characters were a group of pedophiles . They're doing it because kids will accept their requests faster if they see a cartoon pic , it's got nothing to do with ... supporting child violence . * Check the news tonight & pass it on ( about*Check the news tonight & pass it on .

A true friend doesn't care when you're broke , being a bitch , what you weigh , if your house is a mess , what you drive , about your past , or if your family is filled with crazy people . Your conversations pick up where they left off , even if it has been months ( or even years ) apart . They love you ... for who you are . Re-post if you have at least one true friend . They will know who they are ... 
I neeeed some CAFFEINE .......
