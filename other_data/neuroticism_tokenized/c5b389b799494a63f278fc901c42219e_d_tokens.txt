summer is where all the girls go barefoot and their hearts are as free as their toes :] <3

Those who danced were often thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music

i hate texting . hate it with a passion . too bad i'm addicted :] 
i'm having one of those days where i wish i could just disappear . ugh . :/ 
my bus was half an hour late picking us up from school ... ugh . how stupid ! 
life is boring ... so something extremely amazing and entertaining should happen so i won't die of this horrible disease i like to call boredom . i could always do my homework ... but then i might die faster . 
:/ not a good day . in fact , it was horrible . 
hahaha today in foods , i totally failed at cookie making . whoops ! :D at least we didnt burn them , we just made a cookie cake 
i have a black eye ... ohh shnap . this sucks :P 
life is 10% what happens to you , 90% how you deal with it 
I am no where near perfect . i eat when i'm bored , i fall for boys easily , i'm vulnerable to believing lies and i'm hoping one day i won't need a fake smile . i live by quotes that explain exactly what i'm going through and i make up excuses for everything . i have best friends and enemies , i have drama and memories . but that's life and as hard as it may seem , i plan to keep on living it , loving it and learning from it . 
\YOU ARE THE REASON FOR BIRTH CONTROL ! \ " -- my new favorite insult :D " 
ugh . :/ 
I'm so clever that sometimes I don't understand a single word of what I'm saying ... :P 
well , i guess i'm just crazy . but i already knew that , didn't i ... :] 
wow . worst day ever :P 
4 weeks :D 
Ferb , i know what we're gonna do today . 
said my mother : i wish you were a monkey . you'd be so cute and fun ! i'd sit you on my shoulder and when you bit me i'd slap you . \ 
\ 
thanks mom , i'm feeling the love :P 
it ain't what they call you , it's what you answer to :] 
:/ it's kinda funny how one little thing can ruin a perfectly good day 
i hate crying . it makes me feel so ... so ... weak . :P 
10 more days !! :D 
Love me or hate me , either way i'm on your mind :] 
haha i get to skip school tomorrowwww :D 
No more braces :D

Did good first act ! ... not so good during second act . :P 
Disney movies , popcorn ... :) my kind of day 
You know , I fake it oh so well that God himself can’t tell what I mean and why my words are less than parallel with my feet . You ask me what I need and all I really need is to breathe ... -Breathe , He Is We <3 
It's over ! .... It's over :( 
Daylight's coming , the sun is blazing . New beginnings seep into you but in the end it's distant shadows that finally overwhelm your senses . And this time around , is it love that you crown ? And this time around , you'll be more than who you are . <3 
Haha that was fun :) 
Ignorance is your new best friend ... 
Learned something about myself today ... I'm not the flirtatious type . Or at least , not when I try to be . 
Bored , tired , hungry but I can't eat because the thought of food makes me wanna puke . I absolutely LOVE being sick . :P
