When he was done , the lecturer simply said , \And did you come to that empirically ? \"." 
Happy birthday , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > !! 
Feels good to sweat . 
Thanks for the birthday wishes everyone ! I'm snowed in on my birthday . Birthday girl = :( 
Okay , so yesterday was the most horrible birthday of my life thus far . I was cooped up , bored , frustrated and alone the whole day . I refuse to let this slide . This is my birth-week . Officially . It's still about me . Until i am pleased . Thank you . 
Today i am going to celebrate myself . I have a strong , wild and brave heart . 
just received carnations from a vendor at work and got a little too happy about it . And is now ashamed of self . Lol ! What can i say ? Nothing says ' I appreciate you ' like an emblem-emblazoned coffee mug/vase ! 
A final comfort that is small , but not cold : The heart is the only broken instrument that works .

Just put my niece to bed . She says i'm momma velociraptor and she's baby velociraptor . We ran from the lava and the T-Rexes . Took short but frequent fake naps , roasted fake marshmallows , and ran gallantly through the streets , shooting the T-Rexes with guns ( sticks ) . Now she keeps yelling from the bedroom : \I miss you !! \ " \ " I love you !! \"" 
I'm really enjoying Chicago ! Went to the < PROPMALE > Institute and Navy Pier today , then had a few drinks on top of the < PROPFIRST > Hancock building and enjoyed the view . Tomorrow : hiking at Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore .
