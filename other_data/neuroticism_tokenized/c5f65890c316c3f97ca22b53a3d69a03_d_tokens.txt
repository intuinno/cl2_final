Finding people I know . :) 

Adding friends . Sorry about the random invites , just sending requests ! :3 I just reactivated my FB , btw . 
Lol . I'm thinking about disconnecting my Yahoo email from my Facebook , I'm getting raped with 10 messages a minute ._. I'd have done it already , were it not for them all going into one neat folder I can ignore :p 
Internet Explorer ; The #1 browser for downloading a better browser . Chrome all the way ! 
Up late , listening to B.o.B. , multitasking to the point of me wondering how my computer hasn't shot me yet 
School FTL . I can't wait for it to be friday :(((( 
Orchestra Concert @ HHHS ! :) Wish me luck ; I'll tell you how we did ! String bass FTW ! 
Concert was awesome ! Everyone played awesome . :DDDDD 
If you would date me , like this status . If you love me , put a heart ? . If you're my friend , put a smiley face (: If you're upset with me , put a sad face :( . Copy this into your status & see how people feel about you ! 
< PROPMALE > StMarie's relationship status says he's in a relationship . What he does not know is even on the internet your hands still don't count . 
< PROPMALE > StMarie challenged me to a fight . I don't know whether to be disturbed or laugh . 
This is annoying . We want more weekend , Obama wants more school . See the problem here ? T_T 
I don't see why < PROPFEMALE > Pope posts random crap on my wall posts but never replies to my texts or chats . It's starting to get annoying ... 
If it weren't for Mr. Wurman making playing with the band at the football games mandatory , nobody would show up . It's so time consuming and I'm missing out on helping at my neighborhood block party . IT SUCKSSSSS 
Good luck at MSX tomorrow , UG Band ! :D 
Good luck at MSX ! :) \ 
UG Band FTW ! 
Since everyone else is doing it , I might as well too . Like this and I'll tell you what I think of you in all honesty (: 
I hope this weekend will be pretty good . I have no homework or anything for a while , so I'm happy ! ( : Anyone have any weekend plans ? 
Good night , FB . Had a moderately long weekend . Currently sipping a 2 liter of Mountain Dew , gonna need it tomorrow morning ... T-T 
Scout meeting . Be back soon ... HMU 415-8169 
Just ran into an old ' friend ' who doesn't know about me trying to redesign my rep. Ruined my day by bringing up some grudge from about 2 years ago . What makes me sad is that I didn't try to make up for it then ... =( 
Pretty good day , wore a white person manfro :D Anyways , halfway through the week ! Hat day tomorrow ! 
If I devote my time to helping my friends , what do I do when their problems become my problems and their problems are ones I can't answer ? =( Life's become a nightmare inside of a wonderful dream T_T 
It's interesting to see poeple posting about drama ... \ 
When they're partially behind it . \ 
Well , GNFB . 
Spent the entire evening with < PROPFEMALE > , it was amazing (: I love you ! Waking up at 4 in the morning to make a 530 AM trip to Baylor Scout College . After that TrickorTreating with < PROPFEMALE > , Anerys , and < PROPFEMALE > :D

HMU ! 
GNFB ! LOOOONG 2 day week coming up , no ? 
Bring it on , evil 2 day school week . 
Dear Mr. President , I hear you would like to freeze pay rates for Soldiers starting next year . Would you also consider cutting your own pay to save much more money for our country ? While you're at it , lets cut down congressman's pay too . If the people who risk their lives don't get an increase in pay , why would we continue raising pay for those who take no risks and reap the benefits ? Keep it going if you agree . 
Awesome day ! One day to thanksgiving ... ._. 
This day better go by fast ... 
I was chewed out by no less than 3 teachers today . Really bad migraine and kinda sad . :( 2544158169 
Feeling better ; this might be an overall enjoyable break . Text me before I die of lack of sleep ? haha (: 2544158169 
< PROPFEMALE > Januszka Kristyna Pope < PROPFEMALE > Nasiotis < PROPFIRST > Pettaway < PROPFIRST > Apgar < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > Happy Thanksgiving ! :D You guys are awesome (:

Grr . Monday . Feel tired ... \ 
Here we go ... 
Well , inbox me < PROPFIRST > ? (: 
7797 ; I vaguely remember we didn't get off well as buddies . I don't hold grudges though , and I hope you'll forgive me for anything stupid I did :p Yeah , we need to catch up sometime . 
19 ; You're really pretty and really nice . I used to annoy you all the time last year in JazzBand :) Yeah , miss you ! You're a super cool person and I wish I knew you better (: 
56 ; You're really nice to me , really pretty , and really cool (: I wish we talked more ! :D 
704 ; You're the coolest hat stealing watermeloner I know :D You're an amazing writer and an awesome friend (: You're cool out of this world , haha <3 
123456789 ; You're really nice to me . You're really awesome , have an awesome taste in music , and you're really cool . You're always fun to be around , I wish I knew you better , though (: 
2 ; You are one of the coolest people I know . We don't talk much , but you're always really nice to me . You're really pretty , you're an amazing person , and we definitely need to talk more . Keep being so awesome ! :D 
241 ; You're a beautiful , amazing , super cool girl . When you first started talking to me , I couldn't believe it . You're an amazing person and I'm honored you trust me enough to give you advice on stuff . (: <3 
754 ; You're really cool , I remember all the times we < PROPMALE > out out by < PROPFEMALE>'s and just messed around in general . You've always been really nice to me and I wish we hadn't stopped talking (: We need to change that ! 
1 ; There's so much to say . One ; I miss you so much I cried when you left ... You're one of the most amazing people in my life and I have so much to thank you for ... You're beautiful , really cool , amazing , unique in your own aweome way , the list goes on <3 I can't wait until you come down . There's so much I never had the < PROPMALE > to do before you left ! (: 
</3 :'( 
Got back from region band with < PROPFEMALE > Gay , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFEMALE > Broome among others . Concert was awesome , heard a ton of people in the foyer talking about how well we played . High shool did really awesome , but I'm tired now . I'm stuck on a decision ; coffee and productivity or early and sleep ? =\\ 
There's always something to smile about . \ 
There's always someone who loves you for who you are . \ 
There's always someone who cares . \ 
Those are 3 facts that could make the world better if people knew they were true . Make this true for someone by caring enough to talk to someone who seems down , to give a random compliment or just to smile at someone . Make someone's day better , they'll be thankful (: 
We may have a white Christmas , but well , probably not . Welcome to Texas , the bipolar weather state ! (: 
Oh my gosh ! My grandma just took my green hoodie out of the dryer and it's all warm and super fluffy ! (: I could get used to this x ) 
You know the pass if you belong (: http://tinychat.com/tehidiotshack 
May not be going into the week with my head high , but I'm not sad . It's been a short but full weekend . Phew ... GNFB (: 
Dear mental road-block , I'm sorry to say I'm not going to give you my time , my tears , my mourning , my stressful thought , or my self-respect . (: Let's start this week off on a good note ? (: 
Children's tylenol that doesn't work ; $6.00 Tissue box ; $1.00 Your grandparents sending you to school after 2 days of being legitly sick , thinking you're lying to avoid the stressful mess your life has become ? Price-freaking-less . 
Awesome concert , band people ! (: I'm guessing it's going to be a ' very casual Friday' ? X)\ 
:D 
I'm currently in an ongoing poke war with < PROPFEMALE > Nasiotis and < PROPFEMALE > Serna , who wants to join ? XD 
You may think you're a failure , but someone else may see you as their champion . You may think you're ugly , but you're likely someone else's ' work of < PROPMALE>' . You may think you're not strong enough on the inside , but someone else sees you as the toughest person ( if only in spirit ) alive . Don't let that person down , whoever it is ! (: 
Among other things , one thing that makes me sad are people that say \HMU\ " and then don't reply for a long time when you try to talk to them . -." 
When you worry about people all the time , you usually put your own problems behind you . Your equivalent to a perfect day is making someone else's . Then , your problems feel a lot lighter . Thank you to anyone who calls me a friend (: 
Trying out OpenOffice.org . It's like Microsoft Office , but not 200$ . :D 
Morning ! Church , then possibly plans with the amazing < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Vail ? (: 
Bored to a point where nobody should EVER be bored to . Gah , I miss mah people at UG ... But I enjoy no school more ^_^ 
How can you move on from the past when ; one , the present prevents it ; and two , you just don't want to let go ? :/ 
These past 2 months have been possibly the worst of my life . A few certain people still manage to make my day and keep me smiling . Thank you (: 
GNFB (: 
Certainly running out of optimistic ways to look at my situation . =( 
Thank you , Grandma , for making such a big deal out of something that was really nothing , ignoring everything that's going wrong in my life , and pretending you know everything about me when you don't have a clue . 
Never thought I'd say this , but I really can't wait until Heights next year . ( : 
Just woke up , feels like I need to throw up . Uggh ... -_- 
Another attempt to sleep . o-e 
Morning ! (: Finally got to sleep . 
Long day , exams start tomorrow =/ 
Just took a shower . Wide awake . Staying up :p 
Like this and I'll make a confession for each like . 
#1 . I don't get it when girls say they don't dress for guys and then they show up to school wearing v-neck shirts with their boobs popping out and skinny jeans 10 sizes too small , because I can't see who would put themselves through all that pain only for themselves . =/ 
#2 . I like origami . I write poetry . I'm more into technology than sports . \ 
I'm seriously amazed I even have friends . 
#3 . I don't believe it when anyone except my best friends say I'm a nice/cool/legit person . I still have people that joke about it behind my back . 
#4 . I like hugs . A lot . But if you don't want to give me a hug , say so rather than give me one of those half-hearted one arm things . :P 
#6 . I'm not ' popular ' , per say , so people usually don't notice me in the halls . It's amazing how much trash you hear people saying about other people for NO REASON just walking from class to class . When I hear people saying that , I just want to tell the targeted person how amazing they really are , but that's not socially acceptable in a social class full of douchebags . 
More confessions ? LIKE (: 
#7 . I love music . I've considered dropping my path towards the military ( technician field ) for a career in music . Band vs Orchestra ? Orchestra . Apparently I can play bass guitar quite well . (: 
#8 . I'm usually scared to compliment people if certain other people are around , for literal fear of what they would say . 
#9 . Most of my friends are girls . Why ? It makes me sick to hear some of the conversations guys have about girls in the school . Some people are arrogant and don't give a crap . Some guys are pretty legit , though . 
#10 . I wonder all the time whether my friends are covering up a ton of problems with a smile . Heck , I'm living that . 
#11 . A single person is my real reason for wanting to go to Heights . 
#12 . The only thing I hate more than my acne is people that remind me about it . I think I WOULD KNOW , it's living on MY face . T_T 
#13 . I used to absolutely hate texting . Now , my phone comes with me more often than my wallet . 
OneRepublic- GoodLife <3 
I'm going to try to get some sleep . GNFB ! ( :\ 
So many people made my day today <3 
#14 . I care about anyone that has enough humility to talk to someone as unpopular as I am . 
#15 . I'm always told I keep secrets very well . I have some of my own , and you'll never know . 
I hate getting into arguments with people who are \defending someone\ " as an excuse to be an absolute douche to you . " 
Got more service on my terrible phone . In fact , I bought 400 and it's such terrible programming that it gave me 800 units . I'm happy but kinda laughing at the programmers right now ... 
This time ... Don't need another perfect line ... Don't care if critics ever jump in line ... I'm gonna give all my secrets away ! OR- Secrets <3

Thin mints <3 
If you send me one-word texts and don't bother to add some sort of symbol or even punctuation , I will assume I'm either not worth talking to or that something is wrong . 
I don't care how beautiful you are , if you are fake , you're uglier than anyone else . Common truth . 
I don't mind what some single people think , but I hate it . I hate the feeling of being alone . . - . 
On the way to the Gulf coast , spending the weekend aboard the USS Lexington . 5 hour drive should be worth it ? Text me , I need someone to break the monotony . ( :

Back . Dead . Tired . Ugh , school tomorrow X-x 
Feeling sick : c Gonna upload some awesome pics of shiny things that go boom . 
Definition of boredom ; being sick on a Monday . 3 : 
Every inch of me hurts ... : c 
Sick again today . Doctor's visit later today . Can't talk : c 
Strep throat , headache , might be home from school tomorrow too . On pills and cough medicine ... Definition of agony . : c 
And just when I thought I was getting better . I'm hurting all over and have a fever . Why won't the pain go away ? : c 
Oh , how nice . < PROPFIRST > Halabi ignores me for a week , and when I try to talk to her , she deletes me . After she calls me her best friend . I've never felt much crappier . 
Pain :( Can it please go away ? D: 
Home sick again today . Hurt . : c 
Still sick . Grandma's using every excuse to send me to school when I can barely talk . She acts like I enjoy this . < :( 
Just emailed the district about their weather closing policy ... T_T Either way , we shouldn't have school today . The storm that went over/ is over us is the size of Texas . 
Uggh ... lost in thought . So much to say and so much to hide . Such is life ... 
KISD never fails to be the only CenTex district open . Don't they care so much about us when they force us there with a wind chill of 6 ? :3 
Snow . I . Am . Sad . CANNOT BE SAD WITH IT SNOWINGGGGG :D 
Fight with grandma . Obviously I'm 6 and will wander away if let out of the house after 6pm . I'm forced inside and must remain there until tomorrow . FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU

Anyone notice Taboo's epic suit ? Or maybe the epic lightshow ? :D 
If they're EVER putting Fergie in a halftime show , better install some Autotune or it's gonna be ... well ... this . x-x 
Guys , seriously , just because of the crappy sound system and loud crowd , you don't have to hate on the Peas . Serious . 
Nice to know defending the Packers and every BEP except Fergie can get you sworn out and called a girl . Wonderful to know there's decent people in the world

Are students required to attend the parent/teacher conferences with their parents ? This is for my grandma .. > < 
Obviously after 9 years of school I know absolutely nothing and am incapable of individual thought . I'm a spoiled rotten brat that lives with grandparents that are never wrong . Hmm , my grandparents let me learn something new about myself every day ... 
Grandma , all because I say I'm bored doesn't mean my will to do stupid , menial tasks has peaked . 
Terribly sorry to all those who got spammed by the \Sleep app\ " thing . There seriously needs to be a deletion of all those seeding pages ... " 
Why is our society so centered about looks and popularity ? In 40 years , when you and your guy/girl are happily married , possibly retired with good money to live on , will it matter if they were cool , sexy , cute , or hot ? No , because you're both old with greying hair and losing your youth . What's important is that you love the person you're with . Why don't people see that before you've missed your < PROPMALE > ? 
After reading this , you will notice that the chair you are sitting on is slightly uncomfortable and that your head itches a small amount . 
Rock-a-thon was fun :3 
Just woke up . X_X 
Sick X_X 
You and I wake up in a psychiatric < PROPMALE > together . Using 4 words , what would you say to me ? NOTE : If you comment , you must copy and paste this to your status , so I may comment on yours as well . Be a good sport and play along . 4 words is harder than you think ......!! 
Not every guy is a jerk . Not every guy dates girls to get in their pants or to lead them on . Seriously , when girls say that , I can't help but wonder if there's a guy that genuinely likes them that the girl will never know about . :/ 
Odd . I'm yet to lose an argument on Facebook . ( Losing meaning I place the last actual peice of argument before the opposing side starts cussing me out and calling me homosexual ) . 
If a guy treats you like crap , then they don't deserve you . Girls , there are 7 billion people . I guarantee that you'll find someone who doesn't need to cheat on you or put you down as less than him . \

I'm going to sleep . Might lose half my Spring Break to a visit to my Aunt's house ; in the worst possibility no internet and no phone . Might be good , may very well be bad ... Well , night . <3

Last day of Spring break came too quickly :[ 
What is with people ? Being a player is not a good thing ! For God's sake , have some respect for girls ! And you wonder why I never < PROPFEMALE > out with guys ? Because half of them are absolute douchebags . I'm not interrupting in the middle of class to tell what girls I'd bang , I'm not going to call people hoes or laugh when you do , it's not funny . It's degrading and makes you look like an ass . 
Alright , if you've watched my feed you've seen the blog I put out . I want something to write about , so the first person to like this gets mentioned and the first person to comment picks the topic . Can't be the same person for both ! :3 
11:11 ; Wishing for ... too many things to count . < :] 
First to comment on this chooses topic for my next article . Must be something serious , HS or MS related . Go ! :3 
Going to sleep , sorry , articles tomorrow . About to become zombie ... ): [ 
Long day . Well , Mountain Dew and music fix everything . 
Alright guys , night . :] 
I just bought a ( used ) iTouch . Runs fine . I'm happpppppppppyyyyyyyyyy :] 
Questions have officially ruined Facebook . I thought virus apps were bad ? Now they're spamming my feed with horribly-grammared questions that ask trivial stupid questions that you could ask in your status and still get replies if anyone gave a crap . 
Avalanche Tour tickets in < PROPFEMALE > County Expo . Do want . ._. 
I swear to god , if I see another burn book or hatepage or whatever shit they come up with next , I'm calling the police . SMH , this is getting annoying . 
Set up a VPN and a WiFi mouse server . For those who don't speak geek , I can use my iTouch as a mouse or access my computer and all its files from said iTouch . THAT is awesome . :3
