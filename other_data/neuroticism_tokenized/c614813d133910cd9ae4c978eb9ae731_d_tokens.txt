This little box asked me what's on my mind , but I can't really say because I lost it a long time ago . If you find it , please bring it back , or at least contact me in some way . Thanks . ^^ 

I really need to find a way to put pics up , but I have to use the school's computer . XP 
I have tah ' thank @ < PROPMALE > for the pic I now have up . ^^ I can't seem to find any others for myself . I'll keep trying , though . ^^ 
I wanna ' be on top of the world , but for now , I'm satisfied with being on top of my bed . ZzZzZzZzzzzzzzzzzz ... 
I'm awake and wishing I could go do something , but I'm broke and waiting for a special someone to make contact again . * sigh * ^^ 
GRAAAAHR . -.-; 
The cow goes : Mooooooooooooooooooooooooooo . o . < ; 
Super-Awesome Muffin Attack of DOOM !!! * throws every muffin imaginable at anyone who reads this * ( Don't worry . They only bounce off harmlessly , for all of you have magical muffin-repelling shields . ) ^o^

Muargh . -.-; Why won't she contact me ? She said 4pm , and it's been over 4 hours . I hope she's ok . 
Lalala . I hope my girl's ok . She's now in Qatar , if I'm not mistaken . I haven't heard from her in a few days , but I can't afford to worry too much . She gets upset when I nag about how much I worry . ^^ ; 
Blah . ^^ I wish I knew what I wanted to eat . I should go to bed ' cause I'm gonna ' get up in the morning and contact one of my bosses . Night ! 
... * explitive**explitive * I'm tired . 
At least I'm not upset anymore . I've gotten way more talk time than I thought I would , but it's starting to get late and I have to get up in the morning . ^^ 
Grar . I get to go to the doctor's tomorrow . ^^ ; I get to find out what the heck is wrong with me , hopefully . 
Well , I went to the doctor's and ONE of my problems is on its way to being fixed . XD My mom is making me call another doctor in the morning ' cause she is far from satisfied . The one I saw doesn't listen to me . Either that , or he just doesn't think my problems matter or can be fixed . ^^ ; Hope everyone else is doing well . 
Ooh , Ooh !!! Pick me !!! XD All your base are belong to us !!! ( Bring it back , man . Bring it back ! ) ^^ ; 
Still : All your base are belong to us . 
At the end of my f-ing rope . * angerly kills random hampster * * balls for 4 hours * * feels a little better *

Please , put\ 
this on your status if you know or love someone who is gay . My wish is\ 
that people will understand that being gay is neither a disease nor a choice -- people\ 
who are gay are not looking for a cure , but for acceptance and \ 
equal rights . 93% won't copy and paste this . Will you ... make\ 
it your status for at least one hour ? 
You wanna ' know what's on my mind ? Do you really ? \

Please copy and paste this into your status if you know someone , or have been affected by someone , who needs a punch in the face . People who need a punch in the face affect the lives of many . There is still no known cure for people who need a punch in the face , except a punch in the face . 93% of people won't re-post this . Why ? Because ... they probably need a punch in the face .
