Viet's and my trip to Vietnam this summer is CANCELED ! :( 
Beachy Beach today ! It was still warm enough to get in the water . Such a good day . 
Frozen yogurt with dozens of toppings ... mmmmmm ! Perfect ending to a perfect day . 
Have you ever bought that one dress that got 12 complements all in the very first day you wore it ? Then that dress made you realize that you have been shopping the wrong way all your life , becasue that is the way you should feel when you walk out of the house . 
Tonight I made sloppy < PROPFIRST > burgers ( w/ ground chicken instead of beef ) and Viet ate them with rice instead of a hamburger bun . Lol ! And he thinks he has what it takes to be an American ... 
Someone needs to invent a new type of toilet . One that is more sanitary . We have been using the same type of outdated toilet for way too long .

You know what is weird ? Each stall in the faculty bathroom near the lab I\ 
do research at has TWO toilets in them . TWO toilets per stall . WHY ? 
Civility is liberating . It frees us from slavery to self-absorption , impulse and mood . 
I appreciate exceptional intelligence , I can be charmed by beauty , and I am intrigued by charisma . But I will be moved by goodness . \

First meditation lesson today . \ 
It was not what I was expecting ... \ 
and more than I was expecting . 
Rant : Islam is not very different from \ 
Christianity . They are actually very similar . They both use the new and \ 
old testaments of the bible . Muslims believe in Jesus , and all of the \ 
values and ideas Christians do . They just have an extra messiah and an \ 
extra < PROPFEMALE > book on top of all that . Islam is technically an extension \ 
on Christianity . Only the ignorant fear them . 
Between Yes and No ... How much difference ? \ 
Between Good and Evil ... How much difference ? \ 
What others fear I must fear -- How pointless ! \

Did anyone know that right handed people tend to turn right when entering a door , if they have the choice , and left handed people prefer to turn left ? That means when you are looking for the short line in the grocer store , turn left ! \

There is a difference between happiness\ 
that comes from love and all other forms of happiness . 
\'This is what I want to become . This is what I want to become . ' That means you imagine that you are going to be like that - that you are that . Then certainly you will become that . Once you achieve that kind of thought power 
In 2004 , according to the Trasnportation Securtiy Administrration , 650 million passengers traveled in the United States by air . But screeners found only 598 firearms . Tha's roughly one gun for every million passengers -- literally one-in-a-million odds ! \

Multitasking = Forgetting . Not even a computer multitasks ; it switches back and forth between tasks several thousand times per second , thus gining the illusion that everything is happening simultaneously . Our minds provide up with the same illusion , but not , unfortunately , the same results . \ 
My hair straitner broke today . I can't imagine how long I've owned it -- about six years I think -- So I wasn't surprized . But instead of giving up on it , Viet dissected it and fixed it ! 
I should be studying ... 
I had the weirdest dream last night . My friend and I were being chased through central park . I was wearing roller blades and my friend was folded up inside a suitcase with wheels . My pursuers were chasing us by foot . I was speeding through the rolling hills on winding paths , trying to keep control of the heavy suitcase and my balance ....

Please Re-Post this so her friends don't miss it . Thanks ? 
Why doesn't anyone in New York know what Hominy is ? I can't find it in any of the stores . :( 
I am really frustrated with my internet provider .

Really good fortune cookie today :\ 
\In order to discover who you are 
Realized it was only 53 degrees today , excited , I went for a walk . I got about 3 < PROPMALE > from my house and it started raining . Still a beautiful day . I just got home abslolutly dreched , but compleltly happy . :) 
Just tried parsnips for the first time today . Delicious ! I hope I never run out of new things to try . 
Laundromat raised their prices :( 
I just found out that Arizona , Hawaii and parts of Indiana do not observe daylight savings time . It seems like that would be confusing for them , I wonder why they did it .

Am I trying to fit my square head through a round hole ? 
MOST BEAUTIFUL MORNING ! 
24 hours without running water in my Apt ! No washing hands , no drinking water , no showers , no flushing toilet !! Glad that's over . They should warn us about these things in advance !

I found 3 lucky pennies and 2 lucky nickels all before noon today ! Something wonderful might happen tonight !! 
A sudden madness fell upon me yesterday which lead me to climb out of the subway and walk the remaining 39 blocks in the rain . I couldn't help myself : the air was so warm ; the raindrops so big -- almost the size of lychees ; they smelled so fresh ; felt so heavy ; and sounded so beautiful . O how I have missed these warm spring rains . 
Viet sees his first real patients in clinic today . His second year is over and he's finally a student dentist . I'm so happy for him ! 
Bought a new dress today . I was feeling somewhat guilty for spending the money , but as soon as I left the store I found $20 on the ground—FREE dress ! Afterward I was thinking to myself how happy I was when I was reminded of an awful side effect of luck : In order for the world to smile on me , it has to frown on someone else . :( 
I have so many great pictures to show you guys ! But I forgot my camera memory card adapor at home . The only pictures I can upload right now are from my phone . I hope Viet will mail me the adaptor . 
When down a toll road today for 10,000 Viet < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > . That would be less than 50 american cents ! We went to visit < PROPFEMALE > . It is a beautiful city in a valley surrounded by mountains and mist .

Woke up this moring 4:30 and ran on the beach chasing after Mount Son Tra as the sun < PROPFEMALE > to the sound of flutes and classical string intruments . The water was so cold and refreshing after that run . It was perfect . I'll do it again tomorrow . 
This morning we went to the beach , there was a thick fog over the ocean so you couldn't tell where the water ended and the clouds began . The clouds in the sky were very dark except for a big opening right above our heads where we could see the blue sky as well as some higher clouds that were glowing orange and pink from the sunset behind the fog . It was both dark and bright out simultaneously . 
We have countertops , tables , cutting boards , chairs , yet we still do all of our cooking crouched on the kitchen floor cutting vetatables in air . This country fascinates me . 
When people ask how old I am my M ? keeps saying I am a year older than I am . I correct her but she continues saying it anyways . It sort of upset me because I've got a whole year of being 23 to be 23 , I don't want to be 23 when I'm still 22 . But in < PROPFEMALE > they go by the year you are born , not the month . They don't really celebrate b-days becasue everyone gets a year older together on the first day of the lunar new year ! 
When out to eat with my cousin last night . We had a really delicious dinner for two for only two american dollars ! He also bought me a frisbee ! I've been wanting one to play with at the beach for a while now . Hooray ! :)
