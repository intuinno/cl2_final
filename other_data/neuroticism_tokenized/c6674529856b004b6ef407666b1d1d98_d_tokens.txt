I miss her in the weeping of the rain ; I want her at the shrinking of the tide ; The old snows melt from every mountain-side , And last year's leaves are smoke in every < PROPFIRST > ; But last year's bitter loving must remain Heaped on my heart , and my old thoughts abide .

PLEASE put this on your status if you know someone ( or are related to someone ) who has been eaten by dragons . Dragons are nearly unstoppable & in case you didn't know , they can breathe fire . 93% of people won't copy & paste this b/c they have already been eaten by dragons , 6% of people are sitting in the shower armed with fire extinguishers & 1% are awesome & will repost it .
