Epiphany ........... I had one ! Should you make yourself comfortable or others comfortable ...... and if you make someone else comfortable .... whom should make you comfortable ?

In order to help someone who's in a very different vibrational frequency , you've got to adjust your vibrational frequency so that they can hear you . And if we were standing in your physical shoes , we would not adjust our vibrational frequency down - ever . We would not introduce more resistance in our vibration for any reason whatsoever , because disconnecting yourself from resources does not give them more to eat . 
Comment on my post !!!!!!!!!!!!! I dare you !!!!!!!!!
