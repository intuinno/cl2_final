Dear General Public , I am massively jealous of your ability to swim around in the pool carelessly , with no worries . I am jealous of your ice cream and freeze pops . It is the worst thing in the world to sit in a chair on a day when it is 106 degrees . So PLEASE do NOT stand next to me , and tell me how much it must suck to not be allowed in the pool . Trust me , I already know . Love , Your friendly neighborhood Lifeguard . 
theoretically , i should go running . Realistically , i'd rather break something 
we won't say our goodbyes , you know its better that way , we won't break , we won't die , it's just a moment to change , all we are , all we are . 
again with the breaking things ... 
Currently without cellular device . Could be awhile . Like , 4 weeks . So don't text me . You'd be wasting your time

Hawks Victory . 15-6 
The difference between people who live in Northern Harford County , and the ones who live in southern Harford County . Northern-stop and wait for the baby deer to hop over the super high fense .

Well , all i can say is hopefully < PROPMALE > Rapitburger ate the ground a lot , and won't be able to get up in the morning . -Second Half Suicide . Thank You Ravens ... 
In a world where 12-year-olds get pregnant ... wtf ? 
I'm liking the way the roads are looking right now . 
It would be great if there was actually a protein bar that didn't taste like poop . Cause it'd make a great at-work dinner ... dumb . 
Already hoping that it starts snowing like crazy Monday night before i leave so that all the roads are closed and i can't get home . Typical Senior . 
I just love waking up , finding out its sub-zero degrees , and then walking out the door to go spend the next few hours outside . In the sub-zero degrees . yea . ber . 
Has anyone else checked the weather recently ? Itsss AWESOME !! 
One week of now school . Check . Not having to make up the days . Check . 
\this movie was based on real events . \"-- WHY COULDNT THAT HAVE BEEN AT THE BEGINING OF TRANSFORMERS !! " 
wait , we have to go to school tomorrow ?! What the heck is up with that ? 
\You know you've been swimming too long if you look at someone and say ' look at my butt!' with complete confidence \"" 
I hate the weather . 
What's a Bieber ? \ 
I don't know but it kind of looks like a girl . 
Really ? We tie ? That would happen . :) 
And I don't want the world to see me\ 
Cause I don't think that they'd understand\ 
When everything's meant to be broken\ 
I just want you to know who am 
There were some many freaking penis comments that < PROPFIRST > Litter couldn't finish the barito . 
i am a huge fan of stuffing my face at the < PROPFEMALE > corral :) 
Regionals . 
umm what happened to the 70 degrees from friday ? 
ms < PROPFIRST > - \there are no cooties\ " \ 
Last high school swim meet . Ever . It's game time . 
Swimming is over . :( 
I love < PROPFIRST > shindledecker . 
Love hearing my sister complain about her life ... 
moment of truth , work more hours and make more money , or play tennis ... 
The risk of getting pulled over was not enough to keep me from speeding . However , the fact that driving slower means gas preservation ...? Yea , that'll do it . 
Downloading the Burlesque soundtrack :) 
Everything is fleeting . Happy feelings don't last 
Well today sucked 
Well . I'm done high school swimming . Forever . 
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na 
Finished the bluest eye . Already . 
Just used the phrase \innocent and unprepared minds of high school students\ " in my english paper . Something tells me that mrs. < PROPMALE > will not exactly agree ... " 
If you can't even tell me what is wrong with the car , how can you garentee that's it's safe ? \ 
Can't drive other people . Ever . Because it's a huge risk . F this . 
So I have to take the ap English test . I hey credit for a 3 or better 
Every opportunity has a shelf life 
i heart thunderstorms . 
you wouldnt go over the speed limit at all , but you'll run a stop sign ? Nice work . 
Being nice all the time is a lot harder than you might think . 12 hours in and I've already slipped once . 
The truth is rarely pure and never simple . 
Eating dinner then swimming at the arena club with stoecker . :) 
yupp . i'm supposed to be working on an english paper ... 
In sports they call it stepping up . In life it's just called pushing back . 
Dear < PROPFEMALE > government : \ 
Something about the word ILLEGAL makes it seem like the illegal immagrants probably shouldn't get to go to our colleges with in state rates . I'd rather not have to pay for their education . Thanks\ 
Looking for some answers , \ 
But knowing they won't come , \ 
And now it starts to rain , \ 
As I pray for the sun . 
You know its tractorday when you driving a steady 10 < PROPMALE > an hour to school . 
Downloading music . 
Prom was super fun . I love < PROPMALE > Honecker , < PROPFEMALE > Thies , < PROPFIRST > Mink , and < PROPFIRST > Shindledecker . 19 days left . 
It'd be great if today could start over so I could actually enjoy it . 
Please pray for < PROPFIRST > the mouse as he spends his first night in captivity . :) 
Sleeeeeeppp 
You know what your problem is ? You always want people to think that things aren't getting to you . Well I see through that act that you're trying to play . Everyone is allowed to have a rough day . But if you never allow yourself to admit that , then you'll never see the happiness of the truly great days either . 
Out of the three days I said I couldn't work , you put me on for all three . Thank a lot . 
Not everyone has friends who would stage a ridiculous fake fight about lawn chairs just to make them feel better . < PROPMALE > Honecker and < PROPMALE > Hyde are two of the greatest guys I know . 
\nobody makes it out of this world alive \"-- < PROPMALE > Yingling " 
Slightly deaf in my right ear . Nbd . 
4 more days . 
Thanks to everyone for the happy birthdays . Also , thank you north harford for an awesome 4 years . It's all over ! 
Left my phone in west < PROPFEMALE > ... 
Is starting to realize how disconnected you can feel when everyone is NOT just a single text message away . Phone is on it's way back from WVU now , so hopefully i'll have it tomorrow . 
Phone's back !!! 
Gotta love those crazy ex-girlfriends . 
my dad fixed the air conditioning in my car !! 
You should be yourself . Not some jacked up version of a sterotype . 
Worked . Got a MacBook . Going to Swimming .

Going up to school to pick < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > up then going SWIMMING ! ... and then working ...

Why do you do this to me ? -- Secondhand Serenade 
Woke up sick at 3 am . Worst things ever . 
Hoping that my stomach is going to decide that it's willing to let me live my life again . I'd rather not miss work tomorrow . ( ok , I'd love to miss work , but tomorrow is pay day . I need that ) . 
I quit 
Dear General Public , \ 
Please take note of the warning on your TV that says \Code Red\ " . This means that it is too hot outside for safe activities 
Swimming Championships today . My last summer swimming thing ever . (: 
Congratulations to < PROPFIRST > Cappuccio for his fantastic swimming today ! Great job with the record !! (: 
have to song fishing in the dark stuck in my head , watching one tree hill . Not a wonderful combination . 
The burning and the stinging and the high and the heat\ 
and the left-me-wanting-more feeling when he kissed me\ 
i shoulda just called him whiskey -- < PROPFEMALE > Kramer 
There is nothing better than blaring country music with the windows down . :) 
Sleep . Work . Beach ... Work . Sleep . Lake . In that order .

Two weeks until college . Thank . The . Lord 
new tube : easier to stay on around the turns , flys like crazy off the wakes .

I have 17 bug bites just on my feet . they itch like crazy 
Going shopping for last minute school stuff with mom and sister ! 
Got crabs for dinner today . Tomorrow I get < PROPFEMALE > Tree for dinner . I'm liking this whole , getting ready to leave for college thing . 
So I may have convinced the guy at BestBuy to give me 40 dollars off Microsoft Word .... and who says it's better to be a guy ? ( < PROPFIRST > Mink )

Best . Concert . EVER ! Colbie Caillat , Chiddy Bang , Big < PROPFIRST > , < PROPMALE > Miller , 3 Doors Down . I love my college . 
I wish i had cable so I could watch Pretty Little Liars tonight , but idk how to hook it up ): 
You have the backbone of a snake . 
it's funny to see everyone saying \off to college\ " when i've been here for a whole week already . It seems like forever ago that i was home . " 
super happy that i'm not the only one on my floor who's all about the ravens . Great game ! 
and you don't know what you've got til it's gone 
I miss my best friends : < PROPFIRST > Mink , < PROPFIRST > Shindledecker , < PROPMALE > Honecker , < PROPFEMALE > Thies . < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > , and more . ): come to mo-town now . 
An hour to sit by a tree , looking at one of the most historical buildings on campus , waiting for my bio lab . seems kind of perfect . 
give me something that will haunt me when you're not around , \ 
cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile 
You make me smile like the sun , Fall out of bed , \ 
sing like a bird , dizzy in my head , \ 
spin like a record , Crazy on a Sunday night , \ 
you make me dance like a fool , forget how to breath , \ 
shine like gold , buzz like a bee , \ 
just the thought of you can drive me wild\ 
oh you make me smile . 
\i knew no < PROPFEMALE > n could resist your grasping beauty \"-- < PROPFEMALE > bes frienn < PROPFIRST > Shindledecker "

Finding Nemo had never been this funny been this funny before . Love the girls on my floor 
I love rainy/lazy days (: 
after looking at the 10 day forecast , i decided i couldnt wait any longer . I got rain boots . 
That is betrayal and we will call a team meeting 
Just got a 100% on my HIPPA test for Athletic Training . Not a big deal or anything 
My phone fell in a puddle ... ): it's obviously broken 
Lunch with < PROPFIRST > Peake , Biology , New Phone and Girls Night with < PROPFEMALE > Jennings and < PROPFEMALE > Rubino . 
I really want a guitar ... 
Sitting , watching < PROPFIRST > and his floor play some card game ... 
It looks like the curse of second half suicide is over . Lets go ravens !! 
Doing homework with < PROPFIRST > Peake . I should probably say attempting , because both he and Facebook are fairly large distractors . 
Can no longer deny the fact that I am sick . Bed . 
Found out my Nutrition Test Grade !! 98% Baby ! 
They put Sims on Facebook . this could be very dangerous ... 
Dear number 24 on the mountaineers football team , \
