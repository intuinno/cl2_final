Putting my new cd on my iPod :) 
My thoughts are like atoms crashing against each other and one of those atoms just split . My order of thought collapses and I can't think as it begins a massive chain reaction that just seems to continue until it reaches a perpetual state of equilibrium leaving my my mind trapped and me unable to think . Why does this always happen to me ? 
In Tifton at camp , gonna be here all week 
Don't ever think that just because something seems to be going one way , that it's not possible that its going in the complete opposite direction because for all you know , it could be ... 
Well , I'm done with church camp for this year . Two weeks is enough for me but I will definitely miss it and the friends I have made til I come back next year .

Feels ashamed for not knowinng that < PROPFIRST > Radke is in prison and no longer singing for Escape the Fate . (-_-) I am now sad both at this news and at myself . 
Sail with me , into the setting sun , \ 
The battle has been won , but war has just begun . \ 
And as we grow , emotion starts to die . \ 
We need to find a way , just to keep our < PROPFEMALE > alive .

On the frontlines of war ( We have to find a better way)\ 
And I will stand my ground until the end\ 
Till we conquer them all ( we have to find a better way ) 
Anyone NOT doing anything tonight ? 
Change my name , I'm asking you\ 
To take my fame , and wash it away\ 
I'm on my knees , waiting for you\ 
To take my vanity , my vanity 
Anybody wanna < PROPFEMALE > tonight ? 
Wow , a chapter devoted to WWII followed by a chapter devoted to the Cold War . I think I may actually like this U.S. History book . 
Sitting in this room playing Russian Roulette , \ 
Finger on the trigger to my dear Juliet . \ 
Out from the window see her back drop silhouette , \ 
This blood on my hands is something I cannot forget . 
Isn't going to bed till test 8 is finished 
Wants to go back to Academy and get those roller blades .

Don't you love it when people say one thing and then do something that completely contradicts what they said ?? 
Cherishing , those feelings pleasuring\ 
Cover me , unwanted clemency\ 
Scream till there's silence\ 
Scream while there's life left , vanishing\ 
Scream from the pleasure unmask your < PROPFEMALE > , perishing 
Doesn't it feel great when someone tells you something and then they do something that goes completely against what they said ?? 
Come inside now I implore\ 
Do you think you can restore\ 
The crucial pieces missing from my brain\ 
What seems to be the matter dear\ 
Why do you cry and shake with fear\ 
I've only had the best dub me insane . 
We're going away\ 
Crazy adventures await , day after day\ 
I don't remember her name\ 
Oh what a shame it is , oh what a shame 
Visited and toured the North < PROPFEMALE > College and State Univeristy campus today . It was really cool . I'm now seriously considering going there for college .

Empire continues to kill innocent ... civilians . 93% ... won't copy this . Will YOU make this your status for at least one hour ? 
Physics ^_^ 
Forza Motorsport 3 and High Contrast Essentials Mix 2007 ^_^

Just saw a commercial for The Warrior's Way . They were playing Kountry Gentleman by Family Force 5 . I will see that movie whenever it comes out simply because of that :D 
So yeah my life is awesome and from the look of things , it's only gonna get better . :) 
Is it the way that you talk that's causing me to freak\ 
Is it the way that you laugh that's making my heart beat\ 
Is it the way that you kiss It's gotta be the way that you taste , \ 
You taste , you taste , you taste 
Rappelling down 30 and 50 ft towers and a 60 ft < PROPMALE > . Traversing a 1 rope bridge and then a 3 rope bridge . Marching and singing cadence nearly everywhere . And I did shower from the time I got there to the time I got home . What a hooah weekend . 
You're such a gorgeous nightmare . Old habbits never seem to go away . You make me feel brand new again . We ressurect , it's like I've come back to life . 
Ugh , today just keeps getting worse :/ I wish a certain someone could talk to me right now 
Just woke up and is still worried , I hope everything is ok :/ 
She's got my heart strapped down to the beat just like that 808 
This is probably crazy but I'm actually contemplating just going in as a 19D or an 11B 
I don't feel hooah at all right now ... 
I have a feeling I'll regret this but , number game . Do it now . 
285 . I don't really know you . I don't recall ever talking to you or anything so I don't really know what to say :/

And you , all you gotta do is cross the line\ 
I could wait a whole life time\ 
But you just gotta decide\ 
You know I\ 
I've been waiting on the other , waiting on the other side 
So I'm totally doing the number game but nobody is sending me < PROPFIRST > . Its kinda depressing and it's not hooah at all .

His cool factor makes up for it lol . But anyway I can't wait for camp next year so I can < PROPFEMALE > with this guy . Of course we definitely need to before then . :P 
2 . This person is one of the coolest adults I know . I've known her for about 6 or 7 years now and she is really fun to be around . :) 
11 . Eh , you're ok . Lol jk . You're fun to < PROPFEMALE > around and you have a great sense of humor which I think is great . And if there's one thing I've learned being around you it is not to make you mad lol .

Seemed to stop my breath\ 
My head on your chest\ 
Waiting to cave in\ 
From the bottom of my ... \ 
Hear your voice again\ 
Could we dim the sun\ 
And wonder where we've been\ 
Maybe you and me\ 
So kiss me like you did\ 
My heart stopped beating\ 
Such a softer sin ... \ 
I'm melting , I'm melting ... 
I lay my head onto the sand\ 
The sky resembles a back-lit canopy\ 
With holes punched in it\ 
I'm counting UFOs\ 
I signal them with my lighter\ 
And in this moment I am happy ... happy
