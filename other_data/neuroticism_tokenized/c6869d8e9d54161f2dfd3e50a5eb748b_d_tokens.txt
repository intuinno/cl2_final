had a delightful evening despite being dragged to a pop/punk/poseur show where the audience was largley made up of underage girls wearing as little clothing as possible(they all had the same boots though ) , trying desperatley to get noticed by the bands . They gave me tons of material for making snarky comments :-) After , I got to watch the Yankees win the World Series !! WAHOO !!!!!
