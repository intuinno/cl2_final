It's raining . It's been raining since I woke up hours ago . I don't think it will be stopping anytime soon ... I might as well go dance in the rain or something just to spite this bad weather . :) 

Yahoo ! I did 22 < PROPMALE > on my exercise bike thus far ! And I have lost 10lbs since I started eating better healthwise and working out more ~ * :) 30more pounds to go now . * sighs * 
Does anyone want or know someone who wants a chinchilla ? Or two ? I need to find a home for two of mine ~ . 
Urghhh ... Why I am I not tired ?!? >.< 
Learning Japanese on my own ~ ! So far I've memorized a little over half the kana , and have learned the present , past , negative and negative past of ' to be ' . :) Still have to learn kanji after kana though .... But it's fun ~ ! I can write ' badger'(anaguma )' now ~ ! YES !!! And some other words but who needs them anyway when you've got badger ~ ?!?

GOOD NIGHT ! Oyasumi Nasai ! Bonne Nuit ! Buenos Noches ! I am so tired and it so typical that < PROPFEMALE > got Gryffindor :) 
( I got this from Mary ~ ) Be creative ! Now .... \ 
You and I wake up in jail together ... using only FOUR words , what would you\ 
say to me ? ( NOTE : If you comment , you gotta copy and paste this in your\ 
status -- fair is fair -- play along ) 
Yay for my new background ~ ! <3 
I am so tired . I made banana-oatmeal-chocolate chip bread , sugar cookies , toasted pumpkin seeds , helped clean the house and gutted 3 pumpkins today so far . So worth it though , I admit . On a different note-an unfortunate one- my tylenol 3 or the 2 aspirin I took haven't kicked in . At all :( . Gah ! Well , at least it's Halloween ! 
I love remy ~ ! He did this mcdonalds song on youtube~it's amazing ! And ' saudis in audis ' is awesome as well . And his falafel song is ftw ! 
Grr < PROPFEMALE > has not responded to me yet about my books ! Seriously , who takes books that they borrowed from a friend and moves to ACROSS the USA without telling them that they EVEN moved in the first place !?! And then saying ' well I didn't know I was moving to Detroit until I was there ' . YEAH RIGHT . 
Contiuned from earlier post ... You had enough time to pack up MY books but not enough to return them ?!? Damn it ! I am not that gullible , or gullible for all for that matter !!! And she has the gall to say ' well you have some of my books too ' . However < PROPFEMALE > , I was not the one who moved away without even telling you and taking $100 worth of personal property as well . 
Continued again ... And if she even wanted her books so much she could have came and got them BEFORE moving . Or hey she could have contacted ME to send them if they are soooo precious . I don't mind sending them or giving them to her Dad to send them either . 
Continued again again ... Plus the reason why I contacted her in the first place was because she did not respond to my message about my Halloween party . So I went on FB to find her and see if it would be better to invite her that way . Then I found out her current city : Detroit , MI . And I freaked . 
Continued again again again ... So then I gave her some messages about wanting my books back . The first was polite . It was soon erased and never responded too . Second and third were tense but civilized as well . And also deleted . Then she not only unfriended me but some other folks from < PROPMALE > . Wow . Really . Wow . And I have to again initiate communications by sending a message . 
Continuing the Giant Rant . Then after a few messages ( where she said she unfriended me because of my comments . So juvenile ! She could've discussed it with me ! The reason I became further enraged was that she deleted my comments ! W/o saying a WORD . That is so juvenile ! ) of that she decides she wants to do this by email rather than FB . Fine . I wait a couple days to calm down because who wants to be grouchy on Halloween ? 
So yeah , I emailed and messaged her as I said in the beginning and she still hasn't sent back a response . BTW she said in our messages on FB that she had been thinking of a way to return my books . Again , I have to say YEAH RIGHT . She didn't even respond to my messages that she had promptly deleted or ask for my MAILING ADRESS . Yes < PROPFEMALE > , you certainly were thinking of a way to return my books ... Note the sarcasm . 
Last part of the Giant Rant of Doom : So in my email I gave her my adress as well as a tip to tell the post guys that if she says the packages contain books that they will lower the shipping fare on them for her .... Sorry for the rant but I need to get it out again as jumbled as it is . :) At least I feel a smidge better now . Yep I guess < PROPFEMALE > and I aren't really friends anymore . 
I have an interview with Macys at Lynnwood ~ on the 12th ~ ! 
And < PROPFEMALE > is still trying to ignore me about returning my $100+ worth of books .... I sent her another email today . Grrr . I will be visiting her Dad next weekend if she still ignores me . I couldn't last weekend because of work+family . * sighs * 
Wow I haven't been on FB for a while .... Well , here is what's up with me currently . I have been working at Macy's(Alderwood Mall location ) , for the last two weeks or so , as recovery . So I get to help the store keep its appearance neat and tidy . It's pretty fun , a LOT of walking . Continued ... 
My first real day after training was the One Day sale . At the time , I thought it was pretty crazy . Then , these past couple of days , I have experienced a far greater insanity . Black . Friday . I have NEVER even went shopping on this day because of the traffic and crowds , due to the hype . Which is all so so true . Continued again ... 
I worked eight hours on BF and afterwards I believe I expereinced being shellshocked . I would straighten a table of boys ' < PROPFIRST > Hilfiger sweaters and I would go pass them with an armful of clothes to put back on the floor , and to my dismay find them once again in UTTER disarray . Positive : Time goes by faster , exponentially so . 
I am so much more excited for < PROPFEMALE > City Comic con than for Sakura con ! The Shatner is going to be there and it is CHEAPER . Tears streak down my face at the awesomeness of it all . 
Can't sleep , too excited for EMCC . The ennui disapparated for now , and I'm feeling like a kid on christmas < PROPFEMALE > . :D 
Blueberry and strawberry .
