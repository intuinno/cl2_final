bringing back 1995 with some jagged little pill lol 
feeling huffy lol 
Just had to wake up my husband to deal with a spider-in-a-tissue-box situation ... did you know they like Puffs Plus ? Yeah , neither did I . And now I'm itchy ... I HATE SPIDERS ! 
I so need another day off ... damn you Monday for coming so soon ! 
i've got to say ... i'm pretty stoked about my 3 day weekend coming up ! 
quiet night in ... 
Our whole universe was in a hot dense state , Then nearly fourteen billion years ago expansion started . Wait ... The Earth began to cool , The autotrophs began to drool , Neanderthals developed tools , We built a wall ( we built the pyramids ) , Math , science , history , unraveling the mysteries , That all started with the big bang , BANG ! 
soooooo not a fan of this f-ing heat ! 
must .... sleep ... Zzzzzz Zzzzzz Zzzzzz 
Just getting into NYC with < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > ! 
On the train back to Jersey and back to my car from The Big Apple with my girls ! GREAT DAY !! 
wtf ... why are old people in crap cars gunning for me today ?! i had one almost side swipe me and one almost t-boned me ! 
doin ' the daily grind thing 
watching lovely bones ... so far ... i don't know how to feel about it ... 
mine and hubby's 1st attempt at making hoecakes ... so far so good ... though there was a slight dispute over the cooking directions lol 
rah rah ah ah aahhh < PROPFEMALE > ro < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > ga ga ooh la la 
what do tigers dream of when the take a tiger snooze ... 
Worst headache ever ... probably work related . 
can someone explain to me why it is gnats feel the need to come into my apt and fly as close to my face as possible ? 
it must be exhausting having those 2 faces ! 
i desperately need a vacation ... anyone care to fund it for me =) 
Coloring < PROPFEMALE>'s hair ... Oh this could end badly lol 
oh so sleepy 
why is it , no matter what i do to prevent it , mondays always come after sundays ? 
so , as it turns out , throwing a mostly empty water bottle when you're angry can do more damage than you think ... RIP picture frame , you will be missed lol 
movies with the hubbers =) 
Spending time with my twin ... my weekend ritual =) 
ugh ... so not ready to go back to work ! 
\a kiss is a lovely trick designed by nature to stop speech when words become superfluous\ " - < PROPFEMALE > Bergman " 
there is a demonic , fast as shit , flying unknown sort of bug in my apt and i can't find it to kill it ! 
sarah : \have you ever heard of alcohol goggles ? \ " \ 
watching Sex and the City ... this show never gets old =) 
gotta love it when a doctor isn't really sure whats wrong with you . 
i would like , very much , to fast forward to the end of july so i could be on vacation , please and thank you . 
i like most liquor but i don't like gin , don't always like the skin i'm in but when i get it wrong gotta start again still i love the way you love me baby . 
\ I want to get a bumper sticker that says ' I heart not knowing what people heart ' . \ " - Mom " 
i'm sooooo not ready to go back to work tomorrow !! 
oh ... good ... small grease fire in the kitchen ... that'll get your heart goin'! 
so ... i know i'm way late with the times but ... i'm totally in love with netflix on our xbox ! 
3 girls + Atlantic City + < PROPFEMALE > Griffin + Sonic = one hell of a good time lol 
aahh ... stay-cation , how i love thee . 
I love < PROPFIRST > Izzard long long time =) 
headed to VA for some family time =) 
i'm kind of curious what the melting temperature of gummie bears is . some melted in a bag ( by some stroke of luck ) in my car . 
is it too early to be ready for my next vacation ? 
I'm not ready to go back to work ! I need more sleeping in time ... sleep and I used to be so close and now I feel like we don't get any quality time at all anymore . 
jamming out to some Blues Traveler and < PROPMALE > Matthews at work 
Loony's for the game with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Great night ! Football , drinks , dancing and walking home from the bar lol loved it ! 
Looking like tomorrow is going to be a pretty good day . For starters I have off , then it's Loony's for the game with some good people . 
Feels like I'm coming down with ANOTHER summer cold ... This is a little nuts even for me ! 
Dear 924 , I hate you and your 800 traffic lights that I always seem to get red . I just want to get 2 < PROPMALE > down the road in less than 30 mins . I don't feel like this is a lot to ask and I would love it if you would work on that . Thanks . 
Why do bugs wait until < PROPFIRST > is out of town to try to break into my apt ? I've had to do battle with the same stupid bug twice ! 
So , I just tried to watch Letters To < PROPFEMALE > and I kept finding myself in other rooms and doing other things . I guess it couldn't hold my attention ... damn ADD lol 
So , there was a mouse in the branch today ... when I saw it I screamed ... just a lil ' bit . It was very maid from < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > of me 
today has to be better than yesterday , right 
Good day to be a Ravens fan !!! 
So tempted to crawl back under the covers . 
If it weren't for bad luck I would have no luck at all 
f-ing mondays . 
Today is a perfect day to stay home curled up under the blankets ... too bad I had to go to work :-/ 
I'm not sure that there is enough coffee in the world to wake me\ 
up today . 
Something I learned today ... catching your iPod that your husband drops to you from your 3rd floor apartment hurts more than you would expect . 
It's waaaay too early for me to be this tired ... I'm getting old . 
I NEED COFFEE ! 
Doggie play date and carving pumpkins at < PROPFEMALE > and Eric's:-D 
Happy Halloween ! 
I hate Mondays . Thus , I'm no longer going to observe them . And seeing the potential for Tuesdays to take Monday's spot , I'm going to be proactive and cut them out of my week as well . 
Ugh ... 
YEAY ! Stay-cation ... you came back ! You DO love me !! 
Soft < PROPFEMALE > , warm < PROPFEMALE > , little ball of fur ... 
Heading to DC with the hubby to get our tourist on for my birthday =) 
Thank you , everyone for the birthday wishes ! I hada great 27th =) 
Watching Phantom Tollbooth ... oh yes ... on VHS lol I'm going all kindsof retro ! 
Am I the only one that thinks it's funny that Avatar AND Ferngully are on HBO OnDemand ? 
Happy Turkey Day ! 
I'm pretty stoked about getting to sleep in tomorrow =) ( Happy now < PROPFIRST > ? I updated it ! ) 
Watching A < PROPFIRST > Brown Christmas , drinking a hot cup of Swiss Miss , and the tree is decoratedand lit .... bring it < PROPFEMALE > ! 
I'm so NOT ready to get out of bed . 
Can anyone else believe < PROPFIRST > and I have been married for 2 years today ? I love you , < PROPFIRST > , so much . 
Dentist at 2 ... I have a feeling there is bad news in my future lol 
I keep forgetting that yield means floor it . How silly of me . 
I think I should get an \I'm too tired to function\ " day off work today . " 
YEAY ! SNOW !! 
Damn you morning . You've come too soon , yet again . We've had talks about this . 
Come on Ravens ! 
Pretty stoked to have tomorrow off ... not gonna lie . 
Feeling like I kicked some butt on the tredmill today ! Off to a good start for 2011 =) 
Ugh ... I miss snow days . 
I officially hate football . 
I just watched Inception with < PROPFIRST > ... we're both confused . AND that movie stressed me out ! 
I just found my camera that we lost over a year ago ! As it turns out the couch hardcore ate it ( I tore the couch apart a dozen times looking for it and never found it ) . So , in turn , we've lost the DVD remote . Naturally . 
Holding my breath for a snow day ! 
Well , my hopes for getting tomorrow off have been dashed . It's stopped snowing and the cloud cover is clearing away . - = Sigh = - 
I don't think I will ever be able to say that I've read all the books I own lol . I've STARTED reading them all but I've only finished about 1/2 . Damn ADD . 
Sooo , I wasn't sure if I really wanted to see \Just Go With It\ " buuuuut I just found out < PROPMALE > Matthews is in it ... I'll be the first in line now lol " 
Gotta love wa < PROPMALE > up on you day off wedged between your two dogs who ave , somehow , managed to take up 80% of a < PROPMALE > sized bed leaving you twisted and contorted in the middle . 
Oh Glee , how I love thee ... 
Damn Mondays ... double damn Monday morning meetings 
\INCONCEIVABLE ! \"" 
Totally underestimated how hard yoga is . 
Correction . It is yoga and pilates combined and it kicked my ass . 
Great Valentines Day =) 
Hooray for Glee =) 
I think Wednesdays should be bank holidays ... That would work for me =) 
Pilates done : Check . Took dogs for a nice long walk even though the weather is crap : Check . Almost too pooped to go grocery shopping : Check . 
I might be the only person thats still excited for snow =) 
Not a good day ... not even a little bit . 
Good times are always had when Dear Heart Care Bear and Cuppy go out lol 
Ugh ... I need more sleep . 
< PROPFIRST > and I just watched Jackass 3 ... possibly one of the funniest and grossest things I've ever seen ! 
Slainte ! 
A schooner IS a sailboat , stupidhead ! 
I don't know how I do the things I do . When trying to put the front screen back on my fan , which I didn't turn off before doing so , my hand slipped and I jammed my thumb right into the spinning blades . 
Banana 
Love date nights with the hubbers =)
