why do things keep getting worse and worse .... work then dinner and probably disappointed again 
work , then waging war . 
people that can talk all the shit in the world , and play sides back and forth , but can't handle the confrontation ... deserve to be alone and miserable . 
i miss all my friends that i never get to see anymore ... notes to you all ... screw the war , come home ... there is nothing positive about 14 hr flights to africa ... bartending in fl is overrated ! and jersey is too cold ! get here now !

its whatever 
hello bourbon , will you be my best friend tonight ? 
funny how easily a person can be forgotten 
ignorant people entertain me ! 
wishes that laws and rules were still minimal and everything was based off the concept of survival of the fittest .... I would surely be taking some bitches out ! and still be walking free ! 
SHUT UP ALREADY !!!!!!!!!!!! 
i am sick of negative attitudes and turned up noses at my work ! it seems like the only people that make me smile are the patients , even if they are complaining 
going to Durham to see < PROPFEMALE > Easterlin . 
I just got ignored by a 5 year old ... wtf ?! 
ill . 
loves how a fellow co-worker has the audacity to get in my face and try to be intimidatin 
dunno if i have ever been so bored before

not sure if I have ever felt so indifferent to life and its surroundings as I do right now . 
beyond pissed ... newsflash : the world and time doesn't revolve around you and your schedule ! I am sick of keeping my mouth shut to not create an argument ... guess what , you are fucked up and need help ! 
< PROPMALE > , SHUT THE FUCK UP ! 
why is it tied .... seriously ? 
you seriously need psychiatric help ASAP !!! 
wow , going insane in this place i guess , cause i have never been so excited to get out of here and go to work

the < PROPFEMALE > is sick right now 
i love being blown off , really it is awesome to be ignored ! 
pool time ! 
when you find 2 girls that don't have many friends other than each other ... stay away , they are miserable and will lie and talk shit only to make themselves feel better , manipulate situations to better themselves and are pathetic . 
i think i may be addicted to starbucks ... 
an ex is an ex for a reason ... if your past takes precedent over the present then maybe you should reconsider your future 
pretty sure that all guys are exactly alike , yet they all tell you they are different from the last/rest . 
nap time 
mmmmm ... sour patch kids and blood ... how tasty 
all boys are douchbags . 
today has been retarded odd ! 
work , cookout , ufc , party ....... busy BUSY day !!!!!!

time to find a new job ! 
payckeck !!! job interview , meeting with the accountant then pool !!!!!!!

this strange man is watching me eat , its quite disturbing 
last night was interesting to say the least

time to put in my 2 weeks notice and celebrate with lunch !!!!! 
best mood ever ! things couldn't be better ! goodnight < PROPFEMALE > 
my legs feel like jello from working out this morning 
book or tv while i wait on laundry ?

going to amies !!! 
the hot dog from the guy on the corner was too good to be true 
to mad to sleep and gotta be at work at 8 am ... awesome !

someone please bring me lunch at work , i will love you FOREVER !!!! 
i need a new life asap 
so this young childish girl that is completely conceited , narcissistic , and ignorant posted something earlier trying to make herself look like she actually knew something about life , it was an epic fail and made me smile and laugh so hard !!! 
sometimes things never change 
there is always somebody that is more attractive than you ... 
today has been the worst day ever ... ugh i need a drink ! 
somebody please come meet me for a drink , i need one after the day i have had

wanting to do something , that just won't happen , no matter how hard you try , dream or hope ... is just a < PROPMALE > bit discouraging 
I hate people that try to hide things , and lie about them . 
sometimes i speak without thinking ... 
they say the mind is a powerful thing , but i think the heart wins everytime 
gotta love people trying to hide things , real cool . 
the new boy just gave me chill bumps ... keep singing ! 
i just saw the next generation of scene ... its scary .

aside from 2 minor things that i hope will be changing very soon , my life is finally ... almost perfect !! 
Laying in my hammock , under a blanket , staring at the stars : ) 
Fitting into clothes you haven't worn in 6 years ... is an amazing feeling haha 
Ohhh karaoke ... what fun you have been tonight ... and entertaining !

ugh working out so late tonight , but tomorrow is friday and this weekend shall be amazing !!! 
Would you light my candle ? 
Sometimes , I can't help but laugh hysterically at some people's BIOS and quotes ... some people truly are ignorant , and just plain dumb . 
asthma + treadmills = BAD combination 
Evidentially I can't drink vodka 
I love being ignored , disrespected and talked down to all in one night . Luckily tomorrow is a new day , one that none of you will screw up . 
Bayside always comes at just the right times in my life ... and senses fail too !!! 
Best night ever ! Happening right now ! 
Last night was so bitter sweet on so many levels 
pretty sure i have a cracked rib :/ if so this week will be no fun ! 
Why can't pop tarts be fat free or healthy enough I wouldn't feel guilty 
wow , i didn't know that some young people could be this immature , thank you for making me laugh for the rest of the day , i had the best day at work because of it 
absolutely ready to finish my rib piece 
new goals for the next 6 1/2 weeks before my birthday : 20 < PROPMALE > a week , a rigorous 4-5 mile hike , and go on a date to the new ice skating rink downtown :)

cleaning just became less boring since it seems to go faster when listening to stick to your guns ... 
\Its very important to accept each other as we are .... And that's the beginning of love \"" 
ugh i hate depressing movies , time to shop 
i think i've lost my mind :/ 
working out is most definitely addicting ! 
i was afraid it was going to be a war zone in my house today with Florida vs Florida State game on today , but as long as FSU stays ahead , today will be glorious and peaceful ! 
ERRRR !!!! THAT WAS NOT A FIRST DOWN !!!!!!! 
sometimes i wish people would think before the speak , instead of just opening their mouth and hurting you 
goodnight stars , hopefully tomorrow will be better :/ 
Fml ... asthma sure can be brutal 
I have never been called silly by so many boys in one day , wtf is going on ??

Hmmm maybe a drive to calm this anger 
So sick of liars . 
I think this city has some of the biggest hypocrites known to man . 
I feel like a child right now :)

Having a nightmare about being bit by a spider will definitely keep you up for the rest of the night 
These practice MCATs are crazy ! 
Some people need to just stop talking ... or sign out ... wow .
