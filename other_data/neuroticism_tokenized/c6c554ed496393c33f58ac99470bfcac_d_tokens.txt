Music is the hardest < PROPMALE > . It doesn't < PROPFEMALE > on a wall waiting to be stared at by passerby .

I like to think life is good most of the time . However , right now life is trying to tell me I suck . Now on top of a broken foot , I have to battle fevers and sneezing and fatigue too ? Well Crap . 
Had my audition yesterday at UMD !!!!!! XD\ 
It went super well if I do say so ... All of the judges were amazingly sweet . :) 
So I really wish I was at school today ( Scary I know ...! ) but the car wouldn't start so I'm stuck at home working on college stuff for next year . So good and bad . :] 
I just barely passed my first anthro quiz . Omgoodness < PROPMALE > ! <- ( < PROPFEMALE > Rivers , that was for you ) haha . That was hard seriously ... I believe this statement could be office worthy here . Maybe GLEE will cheer me up from my near fail ? :] 
I'm on a cleaning binge right now . Going through everything to bring stuff to GOODWILL . Went to \The Roommate\ " last night with < PROPFEMALE > Bergman . Superr funn man . :D " 
It feels weird to have a free sunday night ... not normal . lol . Figured out what prom dress I want though . :) 
I hate when someone comes back from your past and tries to mess up your future ... it sucks ! :P \ 
Oh and p.s. I've been smiling for like two days straight now ... <3 :} 
So I've been trying to keep myself busy all day by spackling my bedroom and painting it with no windows open . lol . Probably not a good idea ... :) \ 
Agh ... one week ? seriously ? I'm gonna be boreddd . 
I think I might die of boredom this tri . Seriously haha . :) \ 
Guess it's time to find a job to fill up my free time then . 
WAHOOO ! Party of one at my house for the next 5 days ... when I'm not cowering in fear of the axe murderer or homeless guy outside my window ... lol . If you don't get this there's a reason for that . :D 
Ok ... so these past few weeks have been interesting . I got crushed by a guy , then wrote a song about it , went dancing twice , got extremely confused , chased an escaped horse , stayed home alone for 5 days , and had a choir concert . How am I still sane ? lol . :) 
So ... it's saturday and I don't have anything to do . Wow that's a first lol . Maybe I'll finish my college homework so I don't have to do it tomorrow . :) 
< PROPFEMALE > ALERT !!! Edmonton , Kentucky USA little girl , 3 yrs old picked up by man driving grey ... car , license plate : Quebec 72B 381 . Canada . Put this as your status . It could save her . This kidnapping is recent so do it , 3 seconds will not kill you . If it were your child .... what would you want people to do the same 
Omg I have wayy too much to do today and not enough time to get it done ... Awesome . :P \ 
Oh but I did get $90 shoes for $9 bucks today so that made my day . lol . :)
