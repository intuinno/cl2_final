I'm doing good !! Whew ! Loving this 3 day weekend ! =] 
so happy . <3 =]] ... just sayin ' 
In the key of C < PROPMALE > , if you have 3 G's and 1 E right after a V chord and right before a I chord in a cadence , what would that be ? When you play it on the piano , it sounds dominant .. However , E is not in a G chord .. It's in the C chord , but there's no C .. C is the tonic pitch ; therefore , they shouldn't take C out of the chord .. Could it be a NHT ? .. These are the things which are on my mind ... =] I <3 Music Theory . 
... I hate it when there's nothing I can do .. 
< PROPMALE > and I are going to the Fun Zone tomorrow !! 
' \Doubt thou the stars are fire ; \ 
One month !! So happy .
