It feels good to be done ! 
Back home in St. C ... glad it could start out shitty : ' -( 
Wow , so if my awful afternoon wasn't bad enough ... when mom and i got to steak n ' shake to eat dinner my nose decided to bleed horribly for 20 minutes , and therefore I made a bloody mess all over their bathroom sinks that my mom cleaned up . Oh and then if that wasn't good enough yet , i coughed up a giant ball of gooey blood in the sink that almost made me vomit .... fml 
Happy Hanukkah Everyone ! I got a pair of fuzzy socks for my first day ! 
So freaking excited to get my grades ! 3.9 gpa this semester and an A in seminar !! Did I mention I'm leaving for NYC tonight ? Sooo excited :-)

Sooo pissed that my Owl City poster is * NOT * autographed like it was supposed to be ! Had a great weekend at < PROPFIRST>'s though <3 
My how a few years can turn people into true assholes . Maybe they should think for themselves and stop listening to those around them . 
Its semi-creepy when there is a knock at the front door and all that's there is a giant Korean box sitting there ... well as long as there is not a child in that box I don't care . 
I smelled like a glazed doughnut in the shower today because of the lotion I used ... yummm om nom nom ! 
Have a great 2011 ! ( I'm moving to DC in 2 weeks !!!! ) 
I don't want to go back to school . My only motivation is that there are only 4 months before I graduate !!!

It was a sad night because < PROPFIRST > Seich and I watched Undercover Boss about White Castle and it made us hungry so we went to Zanesville White Castle and it was closed :-( .... < PROPFIRST>'s was the last resort

RIP Magic . You were the best cat in the world ... for 14 years . I will miss you , but you will always be loved ! 
Correction : I guess when mom took the cat to the vet she found out that we had her since 1994 , so the cat lived 16 years . So sad to see her go . 
I'm having a graduation party on July 4th . If anyone wants to come let me know and I will give you details . 
WOW ! Go Team USA ! You deserved this one !!! 
< PROPFIRST > and I are going to < PROPMALE > ! 
* Quote of the day from my mother : * \You would think it's like she was driving a mausoleum or something ! \"" 
I'm glad I don't give a shit about basketball . LET\S GO PENS ! " 
Maybe I will sweat one of my ass cheeks off at < PROPFIRST>'s softball practice here in an hour ... 
Wow , Quizno's new commercial with the cats .... sort of reminds me of their old ones . Made me laugh nonetheless . 
My mom just said that < PROPFEMALE > Antoninette had < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE>'s baby ... wow

I tried to keep it together tonight , but seeing you in your softball hoodie made me cry a river of tears ; then i saw your cell phone in hand and it made me smile . I hope you are at peace , and I will see you again . 
Had a great weekend with my love , got new clubs , played a lot of golf , and schooled some kids on go-karts ... this weekend was a success !

Hopefully the Penguins preseason success so far is an indication of how the regular season will go ! 
Great first week of work ! 
Pictures , pictures everywhere 
Watching the Pens and talking to my boy <3 
I wish I had something to do this weekend ... 
I think I froze my nuggz off at the football game tonight ... currently thawing my nuggz with the sunggie < PROPFIRST > Seich made for me . 
Glad my Amish experience for tonight is over with . Oh how I enjoy electricity :-) 
So , how are you doing ? 
When I was little I used to ask my mom all the time if we could invite < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > over for dinner and mom could make cabbage rolls because I thought he would like them . I also thought my dad had his phone number since he worked at an office ... just reminiscing on my childhood . 
* Today's childhood memory * : While in my < PROPMALE > I used to shove my pb&j in the cassette player and tell my mother that it was in the microwave . 
* childhood memory of the day * : After mom got pulled over for going through a red light , the officer came to the window and asked her if she knew why he pulled her over ... before she could get anything out , in my infinate 2 year old wisdon , I blurted out that \it wasn't red it was yellow and mom says you floor it through yellow . \ " After that the officer said he couldn't argue with that and mom got off with a warning . " 
I am bored . I have no friends ... anyone want to be my friend and < PROPFEMALE > out ? 
Thank goodness for < PROPMALE > and Letestu ! Go Pens ! 
Really Pens ??? Way to get F'd in the A you shitheads ! 
Headed to the Bridgeport game in Zanesville ! Go Dogs !

Channel surfing , I've gone pro at that 
Assessing the damage

I am not a Mega Millionaire 
at work ... 
Only 8 more days and I'm D.C. bound .... who's excited : THIS GIRL :) 
Slowest day everrrrrrr 
Dear 6am , \ 
I know we rarely see each other , but could you please take it easy on me tomorrow morning ? I know I am a bear when I wake up no matter what time it is , so I have a feeling I could kill at 6am . \ 
Thanks , \ 
< PROPFEMALE > 
4 and a half-ish days until I move !!!!!!!! 
Freezzzzzing right now . I think its time to snuggle up in some blankets and watch the news :) 
I feel like a poopcicle :( .... but I move in 2.5 days ! :) 
So funny yet so wrong : Toddlers and Tiaras . I enjoy watching psychotic parents ... it makes me much more grateful for having the mom I have . 
Somebody's getting really excited !!!!!! :) :) :) 
Facebook , how can you suck this bad when I need you the most for entertainment right now !?!?!?! 
AHHHHHH MOVING AWAY IN THE MORNING !!!!! 
Move to Arlington .... CHECK ! 
Finish watching Made then time to play housewife and make some dinner ! 
Do some chores , maybe explore , later is the pub quiz and happy hour , and tomorrow is the best : I GET TO DO TRAPEZE !!! 
I'm doing TRAPEZE later . So freaking excited !!! 
Almost time to rock my inner trapeze artist ! 
OMFG Trapeze was the coolest thing I have ever done ! Pictures coming in a few minutes ... 
Taking in the atmosphere at rocket bar ... 
Oh how I love love how people here in DC freak their shit when it snows . Ha ha ha . 
Oh yeah a midnight workout with my man and feeling great ! 
Clarification : The comment about working out with my man last night was meant to be literal .... as in we went to the gym at midnight to lift weights . ( There are less people there late at night ) 
Girls without pants is a growing epidemic in the U.S. If you or someone you know suffers from lack of pants please consider going to a store or thrift shop to buy a real pair of pants that covers your hind quarters . ( This PSA was brought to you by the Properly Panted People of < PROPFEMALE > ) . 
I am being brave and wearing my Pens gear here in DC 
Well the most exciting part of the super bowl was the part that i missed .... Christina Aguilera botching the national anthem . 
I am ready for this super duper weekend ! < PROPFEMALE > is coming to visit , and all of us are doing trapeze Saturday !!! 
Trapeze was pretty fun ! I learned a new trick but missed getting caught on the release , oh well maybe next class :) 
I am surprised I am not more sore than I am today ... yesterday was a very active and fun day . We went to the Holocaust Memorial Museum , walked all over DC , saw the casting call for < PROPFEMALE>'s Next Top Model , played Just Dance 2 , went trapezing , and came back to the apartment and played more Just Dance 2 !!! 
Laundry day ! 
Hmm ... blue bathwater ... should I be afraid ? 
Tonight was a good good night , lol . I love people watching , esp from a balcony in a bar ! 
First day of my new ( short term ) contract job tomorrow . 
Quote from my mother : \Exercising for me is like shoving toxic shit through my pores and veins ! \"" 
Mom and < PROPFIRST > are on their way to visit !!! I'm making deviled eggs as a surprise for < PROPFIRST > since they are his favorite :) 
Wow , so living in DC when a new Apple product comes out is crazy ! The mall across the street had a line wrapped around half of the level the Apple Store was on . Guess everyone needs that new ipad 2 since their old one is now outdated . 
Highlight of my evening : Finding out that the building I live in was home to 2 of the Russian spies arrested in June of 2010 . 
So excited I got to be there for Obama's speech tonight . I sat among all who run this country !
