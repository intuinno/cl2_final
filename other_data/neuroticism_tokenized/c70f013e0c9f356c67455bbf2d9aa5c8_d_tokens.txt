Hmm ... should I change my profile picture ? I dunno , I just feel like this one describes me so well :P . < PROPFEMALE > Vega , < PROPFIRST > Sugasawara , < PROPFEMALE > Kotila , < PROPFEMALE > Linder , and < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > , what do you guys think ? :3 

Bored , as per usual ... 
I'm going to hide from the people at my school for as long as possible ... on Facebook of course ... if < PROPFIRST > Krepelka finds me I'm going to explode(I'm joking ... mostly ... ) ... O_o ... \ 
\ 
* Turns on Cold Blooded Pro and Ninja Pro * >:) 
Grr ... I can't choose a song for my Youtube profile ... on one hand , Kaiba is probably tied for my favorite antihero EVER with Shadow ... not to mention that he has a great theme song :o . but on the other hand , that song I have up now is really , really awesome . \ 
I can't chooooooose ...! >.< ... 
FRIGGIN ' YEAH !!! I was the only one in my class who took my teacher's challenge ( get every question , all multiple choice , wrong , while still chosing a possible answer for each ) and actually did it !!! I FEEL SO SMART XD ! SAY HELLO TO ANOTHER 4.0 FOR ME , WOOOOOT !!! \ 
( If you can't tell , that made my day :D ) 
It asks what's on my mind ... You don't want to know >:) ... \ 
I'm kidding of course XD 
I uploaded a video onto Youtube and WMG hated on it :( . Also my mom wants to friend me ... Should I let her ? :O . 
Time to start my summer school ... O.O ... getting ahead never seemed more annoying ... 
OMGOMGOMGOMGOMG !!! THAT WAS THE WORST REF I'VE EVER SEEN !!! Not only did one of our guys get a yellow card for GETTING HIT IN THE FACE WITH A BALL , he called the third goal a FOUL , and the funny thing is , I HAVEN'T SEEN A PERSON YET WHO KNOWS WHY IT WAS CALLED !!! The players don't know , the commentators don't know , the fans don't know , I don't know ... did the other refs even know ?? 
The sum of my Assassin's Creed 2 travelling experience ... \ 
Ezio : Hey , hey guard ! Guard ! Hey guard ! Hey , hey guard ! \ 
Guard : What ?? WHAT !?!? \ 
Ezio : Knife ! * throws knife*\ 
Yes , it's an annoying orange parody , WHATCHA GONNA DO ABOUT IT ??? XD . Other than having to assassinate like 200 guards , I think that the game was really epic :D . Can't wait for the next one ! 
GAAAAH !!! I've been trying to get a freaking < PROPMALE > ball ALL DAY !!! I CAN'T GET ONE DX DX DX DX !!! Does ANYONE have one , maybe ? PLEASE ?? O_o ... 
I'm tired ... at 8:30 ... and it's summer ... I wish I could stay up late like I used to >.< ... but there's no real reason to nowadays =/ . 
I learned something today and it made me really sad , so I listened to sad music for a half hour ... I still don't feel any better . 
I still don't feel any better >.< ... Oh well , I'm leaving for Lassen Tomorrow , so I can forget about things for a week ... but that also means I won't be able to work on summer school ! Man , having things not go your way sucks and all , but being reminded of it every waking moment of your life is the worst ! 
Looks like I'm not leaving for another day after all ... oh well , I can goof off for another day :o . 
Today , I learned that I talk in my sleep when I'm stressed . The sadest part ? Half the time I talk about CoD >.> . I swear I'm not a no-life ... But my friends never ask me to do anything , so what is there to do ??? 
I'll be back on Fri . If someone needs to ask me something , leave it on my < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Gaaah , now I'm almost home and I learned that my only friend that I talk to this summer is going out of state ! If he doesn't have wi-fi I'ma shoot someone ... In CoD XD . 
... Dangit , if only I was more like Price ! Then I wouldn't be too surprised about these things that are really bothering me ... oh great , now I look up to a CoD character !? I am a no-life ... * sob * 
Woo Hoo !! < PROPFEMALE > hat for meeeeee ... :D . Runescape is so much fun when you can have nice things ^-^ . 
I got back from my first soccer practice since sixth grade ! I felt out of practice , but it seems like I'm on the same level as everyone else :3 . I'll probably replace the old goalie who , no offence , isn't too great at soccer . Time to practice my skillz at chipping the ball and diving , \the wall\ " is back in action ! :D :D :D . " 
The coach said that I'm a good goalie , and that I made some good saves :D . I feel good :P . Not looking forward to wearing the long-sleeved goalie shirt though O_o '' ... 
No one ever comments on my statuses ... anyone who sees this comment on it so I know I'm not ignored :o . \ 
\I WON'T BE IGNOOOOORRRREEEDDD !!!! \"<---- Linkin Park ftw ? " 
Aww , my kitteh Spirit jumped on my and started to purr- AWMAHGAWDHEDROOLEDONMEH !!!! EWWWWWWW !!!

Finally done here now , time to go home :3 . 
Tomorrow won't be fun ... I have 2x as much work as today O_o ... 
Wow ... my family is getting mad at me because I DON'T want to go to a theme park because I have a lot of school work to do ... THIS IS ALL BACKWARDS !!! 
I understand now , < PROPFEMALE > is key , in a few months , my problems may be able to work themselves out :) . I'm not trying to sound cryptic lol , it's true , lots of things work themselves out if you just let them :3 . 
Like\ this status if I have ever made you smile in your life . Then set this as your status and see how many people you made smile . :) " 
I never knew that something that you heard could make you feel physically ill until recently ... 
Sohliekyah . This morning I got up at 5 AM to watch Inuyasha , then fell back asleep . I was groggy all day , and could hardly focus on my work . So , I ask myself , \Was it worth it ...? \ " \ 
Blegh . Soccer sucked today . I almost fainted , I had to play right wing ( defence , my least favorite position ) while the same girl as last time played center , my favorite position . I asked her if I could switch with her and she made a big deal about it , and we couldn't work together at all . Worst of all ... 
I died a little inside ... know why ? I had to play center midfield . ' Nuff said o.o 
I went to the park with my sis today to practice soccer ... and we saw a dead , flattened squirrel just there near a tree , not near a road or anything . I wonder how he got flattened ... O.o '' 
Urf ... I got the rubber bands ... I think I'm gonna die T_T ... 
I went to soccer practice today , and I got to use my goalie gloves ^_^ . When we ran a lap though , my rubber bands made my mouth so tight that I couldn't effectively pant O.o '' ... Oh well , we got popsicles and I got to do some dives , so it's allllll good :3 . 
OMG , taking out those rubber bands was REALLY , REALLY PAINFUL . I think I'm just going to not eat for a few days O.o '' ... 
Wow , FB wasn't working for me for some reason ... weeeird :P 
After Disneyland , the first day of school , and soccer , I feel like doing nothing but just relaxing ... \ 
Until I realize that I have to finish my online class and summer reading . 
Sometimes I just wanna copy someone else's status , word for word , and see if they notice . 
< PROPFEMALE > is bored ... very , very bored . < PROPFEMALE > should do her homework ... 
No one's online ... meh . 
\Linda can I use the TV ? \ " \ 
I don't like my profile picture , I'm gonna take another sometime >.>'' ... 
:D :D :D :D look over thereeeee !!! On mah profileee !! \ 
<----- 
* Is still the smiley face spewing out miniature smiley faces * 
* phew * Okay , I think I'm a little more calmed down now , I'm still extremely happy (: D :D :D :D :D ) , but I'm now calm enough to eat XD . Before today at lunch , I hadn't eaten since the mall yesterday , and I hardly ate anything there :O ! I'm just < PROPFEMALE > excited with everything that's happened :D :D :D . 
I forgot to eat ...! Well , I had a couple bites at lunch , but still O_o ... 
We lost the soccer game 5-2 ... but we got fouled on for 2 of em >.< GRRR . \ 
Oh well , I was goalie the whole time so it's cool :3 . I almost passed out in the heat though O.o '' ... 
:D Had a great time at Great < PROPFEMALE > with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > ... even though it was < PROPFEMALE>'s birthday , we just kinda wandered off XD . 
Saw Inception with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > ? today , that makes today infinitely awesome :D . 
Oh wow , I was sick all day , so my family had to cancel our reservations in Reno ( which I was looking forward to ) ... and then an hour after we would've had to leave , I was just fine ! Ughhh ... today was not my day >.< ! 
At the soccer match , first half , 15 minutes in , we were down 0-3 ... can you guess what the final score was ? Go on , take a guess before you read the rest pleeeease :D ........................... \ 
The final score was 9-4 in our favor XD . Today was also the first match where I was playing , but not the goalie for the whole game ! Only for the second half ... and none got in ;D ( #4 was in the first half still ) . 
Wow , I ran a mile after school to make up for some school days I missed in P.E. , and I look at my watch ... my mom left to get my sister five minutes before I was done , so I had to walk home after running all that distance , and in 80 degree heat T_T ... 
My day was going terribly until after school , then I got to see < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > ?, so it was fine :D . 
Yesterday was so awesome I forgot to write about it ! XD . Went to < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > ? ' s house and played < PROPFEMALE > ch and MW2 with him , < PROPMALE > Karkas , < PROPMALE > Bodine , < PROPFIRST > Ullmark , < PROPFIRST > Biggs , and < PROPFIRST > , who I don't have added XD . Still beats me why you have to shoot someone 5x in the head in Halo to kill them though O_o '' ... 
Ahh , what a wonderful day ! A day without P.E. , and with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > ?... life is good :) . 
Yesterday I saw The Social Network with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > ? ( <3 <3 <3 ) , < PROPMALE > Karkas , < PROPMALE > Bodine , and < PROPFIRST > Ullmark . Great movie , great day , great overall :D . 
An exceedingly normal school day ... except half my chem test was in Russian XD . Oh , and < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > ? came over , so that made the normalness evolve into awesomeness :3 . 
GRR , the soccer game today was SO frustrating ! We ended up losing 6-5 ...! That was awful ... but not as bad as < PROPFIRST > was losing when < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > ? and I left at halftime at their homecoming football game XD . So , even though I lost the game ( and so did you all who read this ) , I had a good day :) . 
I saw < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > ? today , that means today's awesomeness level was ? ^ ? ^_^ . 
In Soviet Russia , toasted toast toasts toasters ! 
Man I've been busy ! Yesterday I had the PSAT , then a soccer game , then the Great < PROPFEMALE > halloween thing with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > ? ( Which was lotsa fun :D ) , then I got up and heard that I have to go to < PROPMALE > for my cousin's birthday ! I'm tired D: 
This was the busiest weekend ever :/ . I feel like I didn't even get to rest before the school week started again ... blegh . Oh well , since I saw < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > ?, it was totally worth it :D <3 . ( Cue < PROPFEMALE > Vega , < PROPFIRST > Sugasawara , and < PROPFEMALE > Kotila saying \EWWWW !! \ " in unison :P ) " 
After a not-so-great school day , I came home and < PROPMALE > out with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > ?, and that made it allllll better :D . 
Wow , last night I got home and went straight to bed XD . But yesterday I went and saw the Earthquakes win 3-0 ( FTW ) with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > ? <3 , which was awesome :D . Soliekyah , that's about it :P . 
Saw < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > ? after school today ... so it was awesome ... again ! XD ( See < PROPFEMALE > Vega ? No hearts this time ;D ) 
We lost the soccer game 3-2 , but that last one that went in nearly broke my finger ! O.o ... Ah well , it feels okay now and only hurts when I ( owww ... ) use it , like for typing XD . < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > ? isn't online now waaah D: lol :P . 
Apple Hill yesterday with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > ? was awesome ! I'm so glad he could make it :D <3 ! 
How do you help someone who constantly overworks himself , and then whenever you try to confront him about it , he only becomes more stressed ? 
I wonder what < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > ? is doing ... I wish he were on ' cause I'm feeling lonely D: 
Saw < PROPFEMALE > Tajima , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > ? ( <3 ) , < PROPMALE > Schick , and other peoples at the < PROPFIRST > anime club party ! I didn't get hate for being from Branham so it's allllllll good :D . 
Homecoming Dance with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > ? was awesome ! Too bad the DJ only played like 2 slow songs D: ... oh well , I still had a great time , thanks for coming < PROPFIRST > !!! :D <3 <3 <3 
My status has been the same for a while , so I think I'm going to change it . 
Had an awesome day , never been happier on a day we lost 1 0-0 at a soccer game ! First of all , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > ? was there the whole time , and then we all went to get burgers , and after a quick stop home we went to see Megamind ! Thanks for being awesome and staying the whole time < PROPFIRST > !! :D <3 <3 <3
