Yeah for Friday ! It the end of a long week AND I get to wear jeans ! 

I am SO excited for tonight !!! < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > rocks ! 
I now have 5 UofU t-shirts which I've been given since I started working at the U , does anyone want one ? Lol 
Craziness begins this weekend ... 
YAHOO ! I just got my Trans-Siberian Orchestra tickets !!! 10th row on the floor ! 
Just had lunch with my best < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > - Wootness ! 
What else can happen this week ? This is NOT me asking \what else could go wrong\ " ... Just asking what's coming down the road " 
Whoeve said nothing is impossible never tried slamming a revolving door 
Whoever said nothing is impossible never tried slamming a revolving door 
To-do's this weekend : Resign myself to life without a car , pack ( again ) , move ( again ) , unpack ( again ) , readjust to changes 
No move ... but we'll see how the no-car thing goes . This should be interesting 
There is no stupid question ... As long as you only ask it once 
I HATE being sick ! I'm trying to force myself to stay awake so I can sleep tonight ( I was ready to go to bed at 6ish ) 
While I'm not glad to be back at work , I'm glad I'm feeling up to it . 
Ugh ... Does it have to be Monday ? 
Let's hear it for good friends & hot men ! 
I'm not a fan of this whole Monday idea 
I have 2 extra tickets for the ballet on Friday night ... Any takers ? 
Only 3 weeks ' til TSO ! 
I only have 19 working days this month ... How cool is that ? 
How did we meet ? 
Humility isn't actually humility unless you're good enough at something to be humble . 
So ... Now what ? 
Where is that simple day before colors broke into shades ? 
How is it that a full grown adult can take such joy in acting like a child ? 
It's Friday & payday ... I am a happy person 
Tomorrow is TSO !!!!!! 
Only 24 hours left ! 
This was SUCH a great weekend ! I feel amazing & rejuvenated . Plus ... it's almost Christmas ! 
- I love my family , but I don't know what to say or how to make things better ... 
When one life ends , other lives will never be the same . 
Contrary to popular opinion ... I LOVE SNOW !!!!

\Pain is temporary . Quitting lasts forever . \ " < PROPMALE > Armstrong " 
I danced with a stuffed animal on your car because I think I need some serious help . 
My sister brought me cookies from Paradise ... < PROPFEMALE > , you are the awesome ! 
Sometimes there's just nothing you can say . 
If you & I woke up in jail together using only FOUR words what would you say to me ?? ( if you comment on this you've gotta put this on your status . fair is fair ) . 
I FINALLY understand why I don't understand math ! 3 empty rooms bring in MORE rent than 2 empty rooms ... & a normal work day gives me 3.5 comp hours for next week . Just think , I've been looking at life all wrong ! 
So ... I'm kind of looking forward to not having to deal with what ( or who ) I can't understand anymore . 
I am literally standing between my 2 craziest friends ... Life is SWEET ! 
It'll all work out . Things will fall into place ( even though it may not be the PLANNED space ) . 
Has officially bought a way too expensive airplane ticket to Washington . I'll rent no car & ( thus far ) have no place to stay ... wish me luck on this grand adventure ! 
Thanks for those of you who expressed their willingness to be hospitable for Tuesday night . I ended up staying with < PROPFIRST > & < PROPMALE > F . who , btw , are the best host & hostess ever ! Great < PROPMALE > food (& tons of it ) ... < PROPFIRST > wanted to make sure I didn't starve & that everyone knows it :-) 
I'm SO looking forward to just being done with this whole moving thing ! 
That was the longest ... doctor's ... appointment ... ever ! 
Just got a new phone ! Don't worry , it's the same number though 
I'm going to ________________________ ! ( Here's your < PROPMALE > people , fill in the blank ) 
All my stuff is officially in my new place ... It's not put away , but it's there . 
Dancing crossing guards are the awesome ! Yes , they do exist :-) 
Thank goodness some things don't work out . 
I'm off to see the < PROPFEMALE > ... The < PROPFEMALE > of Wonderland 
Wishing it was somehow Friday now ... Wishing for the weekend soon . Sometimes it seemed , if I just dreamed , somehow it would be here ... 
I LOVE SNOW !!!! 
I don't understand ! I go to bed at 2 & my body insists on waking up at 7:30 ... I'm tired ! Go back to sleep ! Aargh 
Well ... That was fast 
Women are Angels . And when someone breaks our wings , our spirit , or our hearts , we simply continue to fly ... on a broomstick . We are flexible like that . 
FYI everyone : I'm running off to Vegas today & eloping .......................... ( 4/1/10 ) 
So ... It's Friday ! 
What an awesome weekend ! Short , but great 
... is feeling fairly insomniatic 
It's finally Friday ! 
So what are your fun plans for the weekend ? 
Look at that ! Another Monday survived ! 
a woman's most important accessory is a well dressed man . 
I love the Pioneer Theatre Company ! I love getting tickets to go for free even more !!! 
Left my phone at home today , sadness ... I guess it's fine since the handful of people who call me have my work number . 
Why does Wednesday feel like the week should be SO much farther along week than it is ? 
Just because we haven't landed , doesn't mean that we aren't falling . 
Today is going to be BUSY !!! But so help me , I'll do it all ! 
I get to < PROPFEMALE > out with my favorite boys tonight & all day tomorrow ! 
Fantastic ! I want a roller-skating butler ! 
It boggles my brain how it snow & be 70(ish ) degrees in the same week ... Utah springs are weird 
There is NOTHING you can say about a pineapple that isn't funny ! 
Happy New Week ! 
So ... why do we keep expecting common sense from our parents ? 
What do you know ... This might just work ! 
What's the difference between an adult & a grown-up ? I'm still trying to figure this one out 
It seems like every time I really want to say something I can't think of how to say it right , so I end up not saying anything at all ... 
I want the job that allows me to forget that it's Friday & the money to not care that's it's payday . 
Loves playing Summer sports ! I've already got a banged up knee & did a number on my thumb ... Bring on the pain :-D 
I heard of 6 different ways to spell my name ... Janée ( the right way ) , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , Jané , Jenée , & < PROPFEMALE > . Today I found a 6th Ja'Naye . 
I got a purse ! \ 
Your comments below will indicated how well you know me . 
Great news ! Tarilyn did NOT break the fridge ! 
Why does everything have to happen at once ? Why can't stressors stagger themselves out ? 
What a FANTASTIC day ! Free donuts , soda , cookies , lunch , dinner for tonight , & lunch tomorrow ! Plus I won free movie tickets in a drawing ! Working at the U of U rocks !!! 
Competition time ! Who has the best plans for the 4th of July weekend ? 
What the best advise would you give me ? 
Isn't life grand ? Things you dread don't always happen , time flies when you think it won't , things change for the better ... AND only 100 days left until Hawaii ! 
This was such a quick week , I can't belive it's the end of Friday already ! 
This was the greatest week ever ! 
Yay for softball ! I hope there's enough people for our team to play , treck is gonna hit our team hard 
My nephew's getting ordained a teacher today ! Congrats < PROPMALE > ! :) 
So ... What would YOU do if you got free concert tickets from someone as a thank you ? ... For a Sunday ? 
Problem solved ... No more worries ! 
Has officially earned her first black eye 
Happy Monday ! Note to self : Make this a great week ... No pining over the past long weekend ! 
Apparently I have the perfect \shiner\ " ... I've actually had several compliments on the quality of my black eye " 
Seriously ?!? Grr ... 
Thanks to those who helped with moving yesterday ! You are all awesome ! 
Pre-sale tickets for TSO go on sale tomorrow !!! Who's excited ? I am ! 
What are you grateful for today ? Just put down the first thing that comes to mind , let's see how long we can make this list . 
\I just didn't like all the happy things going on there\ " Sister Woodbury " 
I've done it !!! For the first time in my life I've been to Hawaii , on a cruise , & ... ;-) 
Does anyone want to go to a haunted SOMEthing on Saturday ? I want to go , but don't have a group or anything . What's the best thing around ? 
Alright folks here's the plan : Nightmare on 13th\ 
Who : YOU\ 
What : Nightmare on 13th\ 
When : 7:30 pm Saturday ( tomorrow)\ 
Where : The LDS chapel located at 3300 South 900 East\ 
Why : If you have to ask , you're not ready :D \ 
Text me if you have any questions ... I'm excited ! 
Things to-do before December : Daylight Savings Time change - TSO Concert - THANKSGIVING - Black Friday ... IT'S NOT CHRISTMAS YET !!! 
Customer service training be darned ... There ARE such things as stupid questions ! \ 
What's the dumbest question you've ever had to answer ? 
Some people always have to find something to cpmplain about : the U of U closed due to a pending storm . YAY ! Now people are complaining that the storm DIDN'T happen . No school , no work , & you're not incapacitated by a snowstorm . Where's the downside ? 
Black Friday is a blast ! If you don't have to stand in the freezing pre-dawn insanity ( which we didn't ) & you go a little later you can still get most of the great deals you were looking for anyway ! 
What do you get when you divide a pumpkin's circumference by it's diameter ? \ 
... Pumpkin Pi 
You're sitting in a bar , a song comes on and you suddenly think of me . What song is playing ? Copy and paste this in your status and see what songs you get . 
... In my defense , it sounded like a good idea at the time . 
I am so blessed ! I threw my back out on Sunday & am still sore . I slipped three times on ice on my way in to work & didn't hurt my back once ! How great is that ? 
What color would a smurf turn if you choked it ? 
Thinks it's funny how people who could never stand you before find you on facebook and send you a friend request ... 
Dear < PROPFEMALE > , I know it's a little early , but could you DEFINE naughty ? 
Last night was AWESOME ! I spent an hour & a half pushing other peoples ' cars off the ice , & warned probably a hundred other cars to take another way before THEY got stuck . 
Yes I am ...
