Chicken & stars soup is really good ... the stars can be captured on crackers :) 

All those excessively pink comics in the sunday funnies ... it hurts my brain @.@ 
For some reason I have the \Men in Tights\ " song stuck in my head ... " 
Wants to go to bed ... * sigh * 
I got a < PROPFEMALE > ! 
We named our < PROPFEMALE > Morgoth . I'm the Tolkien nut , I had to explain who he was to < PROPFIRST > , but he liked the sound of the name and that Morgoth was Sauron's boss . Of course , our sweet little < PROPFEMALE > will NEVER live up to the name lol . 
The Rutledge Corn Maze in Tumwater is awesome ! Make sure you go through the regular maze before hitting the haunted maze though , otherwise the main one would seem rather boring ( it is boring in comparison to having ghouls with chainsaws jump out of the corn at you ) . 
Rain is pretty 
I didn't put enough salad in my salad ... 
I am SOOOOOO glad the political ads are almost done with ... they really just make me want to say \F voting and all that political drama \"." 
Okay , I don't hate everyone equally . There are some people that I hate much , much more than other people ... * grumpy * 
Store bought roses smell like grass ... have you ever noticed that ? 
I got a bit bored with quizzes ... 
Beware Ballistic Pinecones !!!! 
I'm sooooo tired right now ... sometimes work just totally blows 
Alas , for the snow is not sticking ! /woe ! 
It's so c-c-c-c , c-c-c-cold ! /shiver ! 
I am thankful for my love , < PROPFIRST > . I am thankful my mom had a smooth surgery and is recovering well . I am thankful my family is all healthy and happy and sheltered . I am thankful for my job , which keeps me sheltered . And most of all , I'm thankful for TURKEY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! yum ! 
Loved Strawberry Shortcake when I was a girl ... she was like the only redhead in cartoons . I never watched GI < PROPFIRST > , so I didn't know about Scarlet . \ 
\ 
Mind you , it has to be the original Strawberry Shortcake . The newest one is all fashion girly and crap , and mine isn't the tomboyish one that was in between them . 
Why are people such bums !? UGH !!! 
I may regret it ... but I'm playing farmville now ... 
A tree fell on my apartment . 
I have a new apartment ... my cats don't like the way it smells . Hopefully they won't poop on it to \improve\ " the smell . " 
Yeeeeeeeeeep . Morgoth pooped on it . 
I wish my cat would come home ... I miss him so much =( 
Tron was awesome , Christmas was awesome . Only thing missing is my idiot cat . 
is just dorky enough . 
I FOUND MY < PROPFEMALE > !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Tree gone , ( most ) pineneedles gone , decorations back in boxes . Is it just me , or is January really bleak ? 
I don't like me sick . Me sick sucks . Especially at work =( 
Wookies are taller , grumpier ewoks , you just don't realize this till the third movie . 
How is this for talent : I hemmed my pants while wearing them , and it was a proper hem job , not a sloppy half-assed one . It even looks properly invisible from the outside of the pants . 
I will never shop at Target again . On Friday they charged me $536 , instead of $53 . It was voided , but it's shown up on my account . They tell me I have to wait two to four business days for the charge to go away . What am I supposed to do in the meantime ? My bank account is now in the negatives . The worst part is their Indian guest relations . They don't understand , they don't listen , they don't care . 
I am so tired of cleaning up cat puke .... 
' Twas brillig and the slithy toves did gire and gimble in the wabe ; all mimsy were the borogoves , and the mome raths outgrabe . 
Happy Saint < PROPFIRST>'s day my < PROPFEMALE > ( or otherwise ) friends ! Don't forget to wear green ! 
My bedroom finally feels like it's mine now . I have put up my < PROPFEMALE > lamp with the blue lampshade =) 
Welcome to the Gas Recession of 2011 ! Please feel free to kick the oil executives ! 
It has not even been a week since my boy < PROPFEMALE > was fixed , and he's already got a potbelly . He's gonna be really fat . 
Thank goodness it's friday ... I can't wait to go home and sleep . 
I think my cat is about to explode . He gorged himself while we weren't looking and now looks like he's about to pop out 10 kittens ... and he's a BOY !!! Stoopid cat thinks I'm starving him now that I've hid the food bowl away . Anyone , can a cat's stomach explode from eating too much ? 
I hate having to be a responsible adult /sulk 
My tonsils look like they're growing mold 
I bought a car today ! Meaning yesterday for the rest of you . However , I cannot drive it >.>;
