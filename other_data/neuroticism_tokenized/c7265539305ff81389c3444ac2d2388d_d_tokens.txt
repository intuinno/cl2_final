THANK YOU everyone for the birthday wishes :D im glad to have finally grown up to adult status and am finally not considered a teenager ! lol 

< PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > and the Phillies !!! : ) 
Up right now because i thought my exam was a 1:30 but as it turns out it's at 5 ... Sweet , I get to sleep : ) 
There are certain mistakes i will never live down and as hard as i try to think positive , i only feel worse . 
so i might graduate in 6 months , and i finally am excited to be done with school and have a job ... a few months ago i didn't want to because i didn't want to grow up , and now i've been looking back at how much has changed and i know i can't stay in memory land . i have to grow up . 
8 hour clinical today , hopefully time to see a c-section or birth and research a < PROPFEMALE > of drugs , presentation worth 10% of my grade tomorrow morning to kids ( why did i volunteer to be an actress of asthma symptoms !!! ) , finishing a 20 < PROPFEMALE > d paper , then hour and a half of lab , another all day clinical , and then finish the week with class from 8am til 5pm ... WEEK SUCKS !!!!! 
me and the black cat make a great team , now i have a wasp in my water bottle ... sting free since 1989 ! 
Group final tuesday , online final wednesday through sunday ... sounds easy , but as always , there is some blackness with stupid finals ... they determine the grades in my class , and if my GPA drops anymore points , im gonna be PISSED ! esp if a 92% is yet another freaking B ... 
My uncle has forced me to reconcile with change ... I do NOT like it : ( 
Thanks everyone for birthday wishes !!!! 21 :D 
Saturday was awesome ... thank you best friends : ) 
I am thinking of atrial and ventricular fibrillation in metaphors ... that's how much nursing has ruined my life lol 
So two magaritas and two ameretto shots from < PROPFEMALE > garden lands you in michigan two seconds away from a bar fight with a 40 year old woman/alcoholic and her stupid man friend ... definitely didn't see that coming lol 
SNOW ... delightful :D 
I would rather not do my homework tonight ... seems to be my mindset all semester long ... last final in 2 weeks !!!! 
If you think im a bad friend , fine . I admit im still selfish , impulsive , and seemingly cold sometimes . cold because im tired of being vulnerable . impulsive and selfish because im still looking for something . but i appreciate the friends i do have . after all the shit i can do , they stick around . so either stick around or dont . i will still remember you ... 
I GRADUATE in one week !!!!!!!!!!! :D 
DONE with finals ... end result = A in adult health 2 ( redemption after considering my 92% a flat B in adult health 1 ) and a careless attempt at a pointless research final ! :D 
The after effects of college education : Still don't know when to stop and still don't understand that going to a hot stranger's house with his guy friends and only one of my girl friends is a bad idea ! Good thing the third friend said NO ! 
\Hey how's your day ? Got Herpes ? \"" 
All A's!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And my Mommy is here and im graduating ... im so happy ! :D 
Aw , thanks toledo ... im only here for a few more days , but thanks for the big FUCK you sending away gift !
