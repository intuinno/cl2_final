do be do-be do 

I finished reading Paulo Coehlo’s “Veronica decides to die , ” yesterday . I loved the < PROPFEMALE > and its softness about reality and what is insanity . The rumination that to dare to believe and think differently is often considered crazy for the society that sets the standard , just based on majority . Structure has a way of creating a prison , and mundane routine becomes a poison that eats away at the soul . 
From the book , I draw two amazing quotes : “Walk in the ways of thine heart , and in the sight of thine eyes : but know thou , that for all these things , God will bring thee to judgement . ” “Be like the fountain that overflows , not like the cistern that merely contains . ” 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas to all of my friends and buddies !!!!! - oh yeah .... and family . 
Snow !!!!!! - MMmmmmmm Tasty .... 
is eating burnt tasting Nekot Cookies .... How the heck did they get past packaging !! 
is breathing ... 
is saddened ... over a test score .... How the hell did I get a 77 !?!?! 
is in a state of melancholic confusion ... 
I am finding myself getting more nerdy as I study . Just realized that I am fascinated by the biochemical mechanism of genetic diseases and how they occur . It is all coming together ... 
Cannot understand why people cannot sacrifice a couple of dollars to help millions . 
Trying to be accomplished today 
Too exhausted .... I don't want to go to work .... :( ... 
4 days till my test date ... then relaxation 
Well ... I am alive . I hope I did well . But can you really ever know for sure until you get the score ? 
The last airbender sucks .... I am sad now ... :( 
Nothing can replace the Avatar Cartoon .... It is a legacy in itself . 
Figuring out future planns and bills today 
Figuring out future plans and bills today 
Grrrr ... I left my phone at home in the morning rush ... 
Yet none could better know than I , \ 
How much of act at human hands\ 
The sense of human will demands\ 
By which we dare to live or die . \ 
-A . Tennyson 
And dreams came around you in a hazy rain\ 
You opened your mouth wide to feel them fall ... -Something Corporate ( old school ) 
... 
I think I will go again today , to where the water flows and my mind finds its liberation .... 
I've destroyed the stars\ 
taken back the images of constellations\ 
and replaced them with delusions of lesser things\ 
Here no man is greater\ 
I am no greater\ 
This price is a high one\ 
and it will rip me apart with time\ 
I regret it now\ 
Regret that my stumbles through the wilderness\ 
have led me here\ 
there are no stars in the sky\ 
now that they are fallin\ 
no dreams when yours are breaking\ 
Only sorrow that flows from the deep . 
I can only hope to make this better in time ... 
\Tell the truth even if it hurts ... It will hurt me to . \ " -Punchline " 
Take your circumstance , piece by piece , day by day , and step by step . 
I am disappointed by this hurricane , I was hoping for more umpfh . 
Thank you everybody ! It has been a long day and I just got in . I appreciate your wishes and love . :) 
Too much work ... 
hmmm ..... busy busy busy 
So ... my computer crashed 
What is this press upon me ? \ 
Life should not be this difficult\ 
When I know there once was a time 
Now that familiar glow of youth\ 
Is just a memory\ 
And I can still feel the imprint \ 
that it had left upon my heart\ 
If this chaotic existence of work and supposed success\ 
Did not exist , I believe that we would , as men , \ 
Truly experience some kind of renaissance\ 
Some kind of awaking of our souls\ 
Because we are starving\ 
Our time to reflect is chased away by obligation and necessity 
As the veils become thin , the souls of the departed shall once again come to be amongst the living . Let us know what it is to remember . Have a great All Hallows < PROPFEMALE > everyone 
Still working on a project since this morning . Yea for insulation and dry wall . This closet will be a masterpiece !!! 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone !!!!! 
Today has been hell and more hell . I detest capitalism and insurance .
