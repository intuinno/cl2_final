Less than 12 hours to GO TIME . Here we come VEGAS , then on to FIESTA BOWL-LAND , AZ ! 

Found a little inner peace and mental clarity on a long ride into the mountains on a 4-wheeler with N8 ... took a long , hard look in the mirror this morning and with a deep breath , deleted Farm Town . Wish I was this strong when it came to Mafia Wars . 
preparing for WAR on earwigs eatin ' my sweet < PROPMALE > and fresh-planted petunias . 
... wondering if I can avoid the Interweb until Monday morning ? methinks not but it sounds real real good ... 
straight A's again for summer school ( constitutional law class starts monday ) . and the dog peed on my leg at the dog park . awesome . 
In the following quote , which founding father was my professor referring to during first day of Constitutional Law class ? \BF is NOT my BFF ! \"" 
In his decision in the cases the proposition that Justice Hughes rejected was that \Congress is impotent to control the intrastate charges of an interstate carrier even to the extent necessary to prevent injurious discrimination against interstate traffic "

update on the jackpot trip : obviously ( because I'm home getting ready to work on my paper due Monday ) didn't hit it big . Or win anything . If that 3 card poker dealer had just stopped getting all those STRAIGHTS . Just gonna have to try again ... soon . 
sorry , been too busy playing < PROPFEMALE > Pinata and Wii Sports Resort to keep my Conn Law Professor updates current .... just remembered yesterday's gem after someone found a quote by < PROPMALE > that was actually in support of the day's argument ( why current wides 
Almost forgot today's Conn Law Professor gem : referring to residents of the state of Utah as \Utards . \"" 
Workin ' in the Garden Valley office today . Life's ROUGH ! 
This house is filled with many birds . She said to me , \I can understand their words . \"" 
This wrinkle in time is givin ' me a headache ! My heart's crammed in my cranium and it still knows how to pound . 
Last night was totally worth the blisters on my feet . Would've had no view of the stage without that extra 3+ inches ! 
5 court cases read and homemade cheesy shredded chicken enchiladas on the dinner table ! Where do I find the time ?! :) 
would like to thank my favorite neighbor for chainsawing my other neighbor's trees at 12:30 am . You have won prizes for my not getting back to sleep : a call to the police to report vandalism and let officials know I saw it all , & another public nuisance 
Kinda bummed that summer is almost over and I still neither re-implemented a regular running routine nor got around to losing that 15 lbs I'd planned to ... 
Watchin ' my neighbors set up their garbage sale . Can't wait to stare at their junk all day while i'm stuck home writing a paper . Seriously how can you not know that computer monitors from 1989 aren't worth a dime anymore ? \WHY YOU TRYIN ' TO SELL ME GARBAGE ?!?!? \"" 
loves today's heavy rain storms ... 
overwhelmed just thinking about thinking about my paper . ugh . 
After reflecting that last Fall semester the only thing that kept my energy up and my sanity was running regularly in the mornings 3-4 days/week . Decided to get ass in gear today and ended up on an amazing morning run/walk around the neighborhood with the pup . 2 mile Hawthorne/39th loop . Felt like I could keep going forever but decided it's preferable that I not be too sore to walk tomorrow . Love that runner's high 
searching for THE perfect photo that symbolizes the verb \to like . \"" 
1 < PROPFEMALE > left . Want to get this paper OVER with but brain refuses to cooperate with my request for concentration . 
Just finished a 3-hour Constitutional Law final essay test . I laughed , I cried , I considered giving up but I pulled through . Am now totally worn out but excited about two weekends w/o homework . Is it Friday yet ??? 
Staring at a half full bottle of Lysol cleaning fluid refill , but can't find the spray bottle that it is intended to refill . #FML 
8:35 AM Saturday August 15th . 2 mile dog-jog : check . Shower : check . Coffee : check . What's left on to-do list ? Toasting < PROPFEMALE>'s birthday tonite and ANYTHING I WANNA DO before that ! It's a GREAT day ! 
A Lovely Dinner @ Vietnamese Restaurant with the Halls tonite ! Thanks again ! *** can't wait for leftovers *** 
Didn't realize what a long day I was in for when I left for work this morning ... at 2:30 pm today unexpectedly got the good news that an opening came up for a LSAT prep course .. class is 6 pm TONITE . Feels good to be right on track if I do decide I want to go on a law school adventure to fund Nate's his puppy-farm dreams ... *** here's to taking advantage of an amazing tes t-t aking ability *** 
Four years ago to the day ... < PROPMALE > joined the family ! 
Too damn early to practice LSAT crap . guess this is prepping me for having to be in goddamn Caldwell at 8:30 am for the actual test on Sept 28 . 
Last-minute cleaning and organizing of my life before the juggling act begins tomorrow . Time is going to fly between now and December ... and can't wait for all the fun this Bronco season promises ! 
Woke up this morning with that \I'm getting a cold\ " feeling in the back of the nose/throat . Could be a false alarm since I haven't had an actual cold in years . Could have forgotten what a cold feels like . Let's hope ; I don't have time for this . " 
Finally came down with that cold around 3 pm yesterday . Wasn't convinced I was actually sick until I spent the rest of the evening and all night miserably stuffed up . 
sick and high as a kite on cold meds . perfect storm conditions for doing homework ... don't mind if I do ! 
Would like to thank my old friend , NyQuil , for a fabulous evening . Too bad I can't feel as good awake as I did while sleeping ( where there's no lonely-time ... just dreams ) . Off to LSAT prep ; would have skipped this morning if illness hadn't required my skipping Thurs night . dammit . 
GO ORANGE ! GO BIG BLUE ! FIGHT FIGHT BSU !!!!!!!!!!!!! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOO !!! 
Way to go Broncos !! LOVE FOOTBALL SEASON !!! 
totally intimidated and overwhelmed by my new phone . 
A * little * excited that my practice LSAT score in class last night would've qualified me for a full-ride scholarship to a law school that sent me an informational email . Maybe dreams can come true ? 
WOOO HOOOO !!! Game on Broncos !!! Let's do this ! 
trying out my new calorie-counter phone app -- if I scan the barcode of every food before shoveling it into my mouth it will tell me the nutritional value of it and track everything i ate all day . Ooooh , the levels of obsessive-compulsion I could take this to .... 
Test in Campaigns & Elections Friday , LSAT Saturday , 6-page paper due Mon 9/28 . Can't I just go back to bed ??? 
7 am flight to AZ tomorrow . First time there , totally stoked . Gone til Sunday . Peace out . 
wondering why I schedule dr's appointments on campus for 8 am on a friday morning when class doesn't start unti 9:40 ??? But , on the plus side , < PROPMALE > Petcash just told me our president is now a Nobel Prize winner . 
Headaches and hunger pangs are a sucky combo . Good thing my turkey meatloaf is finally ready ! 
Thinkin ' its total crap that school's not closed today , too . 
It's 5:09 am . I have two goals before 9:00 am : workout ( to improve mood and energy ) and finish paper ( to maintain GPA ) . GO ! 
Amazing what a difference just 20 minutes of jogging with < PROPMALE > in fresh , pre-rainstorm air can make . Food tastes better , showers feel better , and I'm not so close to snapping at the next person who pisses me off . 
super excited that it's past 4 pm on Sunday and only just finished the study guide ( started yesterday ) for my comparative politics midterm tomorrow morning . Still have laundry+ironing , and actually STUDYING aforementioned study guide tonite . and really looking forward to tomorrow ( school , work , school 9 am-9 pm ) . BURNT . OUT . 
< PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > = MOST BORING POLITICAL WRITER EVER . 
This morning < PROPMALE > and I were involved in a standoff with a large , snarling , growling border collie mix who was out loose in the neighborhood . I won . 
trying to get mentally prepred to write 6-8 pages on FDR's progressive re-interpretation of the Constitution . Which unfortunately also means a lot of referencing my current FAV writer , Woody < PROPMALE > . Enjoy this gorgeous Sat outdoors for me if you can . 
Somehow I managed to kink up my neck and shoulders while writing my paper this morning . I can't turn my head right or left which made it really interesting when I was driving to the store for an errand---it's really hard to check your blind spot when you have to move your entire body left or right . Now waiting for the muscle relaxers to kick in . 
Trying to focus on prep work for my paper on the \political and philosophical significance of Athens defeat in Sicily . \ " Not due until next Friday but I gots to gets to the Utah game ! Go BRONCOS ! " 
I am really REALLY hoping I have enough energy to have an AWESOME time at Electric Six tonite , work all day AND finish a paper tomorrow , and be ready to head on down to < PROPFIRST > Friday to see the Broncos kick some < PROPFEMALE > ass ! Anyone know where I can get some cheapcheapcheap snow pants on the fly ? I REALLY don't want to freeze in Utah like I did in the stadium at the U of I game Saturday . 
WHY does it have to be a struggle just to print something to friggin ' PDF ???? can you murder a computer ? 
Found myself some snow pants for the Utah trip ! $15 at Shopko ... Only catch ? They're from the little boys ' department . Not sure if it is a good or bad thing that I'm the same pant size as an XXL boy ? 
last day of work and school til Nov 30th ! WOO HOOO vacation AND Thanksgiving ( by far the BEST holiday ! ) .. If only I didn't have so much homework to do over the next week ... 
Hey Everyone !! If you're watching the Bronco game tonite on ESPN , look for me & the Hall crew . We'll be wearing orange ! ;) 
It's always good to be home ... Had a great time seeing everyone and taking in the game ! One word of advice : don't eat the hot dogs at Utah State stadium ( unless you're a fan of throwing up in public when you haven't had enough beer to not feel humiliated ... ) . 
After doing homework since 11 this morning , I am realizing I am not on vacation this week . I have only seven days to read 3 books cover to cover and write three papers just to get caught up and on track for the rest of the semester . 
About halfway through a precinct-level analysis of Idaho Legislative District 16 , one of the few competitive legislative districts in Idaho ( and the district of yours truly ) . Interestingly , non-competitive districts are fast becoming the norm due to a blend of people ' sorting ' themselves into like-minded communities due to correlating interests and gerrymandering in the redistricting process . 
Homework sucks . Time to play some Xbox . 
Happy Thanksgiving ! 
Thankful for a relaxing holiday with my family yesterday . First time in 9 years my brother didn't have to work on Thanksgiving Day ! Pretty sure my mom is now addicted to Wii golf ; sounds like Dad's gonna have to buy her one since she let him buy a flatscreen :) 
Time to start getting prepped and psyched for a looong night . ETA ( estimated tailgate arrival ): 5:30 pm ; Kickoff : 8:15 pm . Moore v Kaepernick , Broncos v Wolfpack ... Will we have another record-breaking event ? Regardless , I have a feeling it's gonna be a doozy ! 
So excited I have dinner being made FOR me !! What a nice boyfriend ! 
I could use a clever campaign slogan right about now ... 
... the final push begins .... one more paper to bang out this weekend and turn in Monday , one more week of lecture and a whole lot of reading to catch up on ; three final exams on Monday Dec 14th , and one take-home final due Wednesday Dec 16th . I already know my straight-A streak has come to an end , but I've decided I can live with a single B on my transcript . Who knows , this may be the first of many ! :) 
spending every minute of ' downtime ' I can find watching every episode of 30 Rock . Realized the character of < PROPFIRST > Donaghy is the embodiment of classical liberalism and I love it . After putzing around in a stressed/exhausted ' idealistic phase ' since March ( fueled by a messy string of misfortunate events ) I feel like my enery and ambition are being rekindled . I wanna be < PROPFIRST > Donaghy . Is it bad to be inspired by TV ? 
Thought I'd get some extra rest by going to bed \early\ " at 10 PM last night and now I'm wide awake at 4 AM . Must just be gettin ' old ... " 
Just had my \Jack Donaghy-Classic Liberalism\ " theory crushed . Watched an episode in which he espoused something along the lines of how history will reveal the justice of the Iraq war . Donaghy may just be a Republican . Ugh . " 
I am wondering how \just a trim to clean up my barely-layered ends\ " translated to \ " CUT 4 INCHES OF CHOPPY UGLY LAYERS INTO MY HAIR . \ " I could KILL someone . My hair went from past my shoulders to practically chin-length shit in less than 30 minutes . I was not at all prepared for this . " 
time to crack some more books today . I am glad it's snowing because it makes me happy to be inside where it's warm and less resentful of this last push of school work I gotta get through . 3 finals tomorrow ; 2-hour essay tests each . Gonna be a busy week ... Thursday can't come soon enough ! 
Two finals down , gotta wait until 6 for the last one ( for today ) . UGH just want to get it over with . Definitely did NOT do so hot on the second test today . At this point , I'll be relieved to get a B but won't be surprised if it's a C in that class . Ancient political thought just ain't my cup I guess . 
finally have 3.5 weeks to do whatever I want in my free time ... there is so much i want to do , yet i'm compelled by the temptation to just do nothing and love every minute of it ... 
Excited for tomorrow ! half day at work , a meeting , then settling in for a loong relaxing weekend without homework hanging over my head ... LOVE IT . 
It takes a sick person to be excited about hopping outta bed at 6 am on a Saturday , ready to start a day full of plans to clean and organize ... 
ruined two of my fav pairs of pants in the wash and woke up to find < PROPMALE > with a really nasty ear infection I'll now be dealing with all week . can we just fast forward to spring ( with a short interlude for the fiesta bowl) ? 
Glad to be back at the house with my boys after an extended stay at my folks followed by a de-licious prime rib meal with the Halls ( and some pretty freakin ' awesome gifts ! ) . Hope everyone had a Christmas at least half as nice and relaxing as mine was ( except for the 4 hour Wii tournament with my folks and bro that went past midnight ... heckling is a proud family tradition , but short tempers are also in our genes ) . 
The trip of a lifetime has come to an end . It's 12:30 am and we're finally out of the car after a 3-state drive that began at 6 am today . Realized I've been wearing the same shirt for over 36 hours . Much love and endless gratitude to the Halls ( of Boise AND AZ ) . So many amazing memories ... Can't wait for that shower , now . 
Sore dry throat , swollen sinuses , achy muscles and light headedness . Either the Fiesta Bowl trip really took a number on me or I've come down with something . Ugh . 
black 
Know what sucks ? When you feel like you've taken too many cold pills even though you haven't taken any cold pills . Know what sucks even worse ? When you feel that way on the last legs of a vacation !!! < PROPMALE > is right , this cold/sinus thing is a helluva beast . 
Daydreaming about when it will finally be warm enough to get my fingers in the soil ... This will be the year for geraniums , nasturtiums , and purple coneflower . And probably some sweet alyssum , and petunias ... maybe a few more mums and irises ... oh god I can't stop !!! 
Can a cold get a second wind ? Or maybe it was the nyquil I took at midnight that messed me up .. 
I actually think its a bad sign when you're not panicked about returning to work after a week-long vacation . I managed to suppress a couple of panic waves last night but somehow I'm calm , cool , and collected this morning . Maybe its the cold meds ... 
Nothing like a sweet , smilin ' , old dog to make you appreciate how much fun a slow , comfortable jog around the neighborhood is ; especially when that jog includes an off-leash interlude at the little neighborhood park ! Side note : I have also discovered there are at least two different homes that keep swans in the area . 
The last pet of my youth passed away today . Rest in peace , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > ( AKA Moosie ) . You were the fattest , angriest < PROPFEMALE > but you loved my brother like crazy and he loved that you loved him . I will miss chasing you down to grab you and jiggle your big , tubby belly , and how you drooled when you purred . 
Me & n8's dinner last night : beer and lucky charms . But I am pretty sure that was an accident and we just forgot to make dinner . 
Nobody writes a musical for no reason ! 
Today's definitely going to be an interesting one . 
My brain only gets another 19 hours of vacation . Statistical Methods , Intro to Logic , and Modern Political Philosophy will soon be taking over . TGIPMLFTS(thank goodness its probably my last full time semester) ! I am looking forward to Yenor's lectures on Locke , Rousseau , Machiavelli , and Hobbes , though . The other two professors have excellent reviews on ratemyprofessors.com, which thankfully hasn't let me down yet . 
Back to school ! First class canceled due to jury duty for Prof , so I got to take Dex out for a GORGEOUS 2 miler around the ' hood instead . BEST WAY EVER to start a new semester ! 
Woke up at 3:45 AM to the sound of < PROPMALE > staring at me from the darkness . I have a feeling he was breathing on us for awhile . Now < PROPMALE>'s falling asleep on the couch and n8 and I are brewing the coffee . 
Just watched n8 < PROPFEMALE > a cup of < PROPMALE>'s kibble to the living room and pretend to eat it in front of a very anxious and desperate doggy . We like to make him dance for his dinner . Is it bad it's so much fun to tease and torment that lil ' guy ? 
It's Doppelgänger week - change your profile picture to someone famous ( actor , musician , athlete , etc . ) you have been told you look like . After you update your profile with your twin or switched-at-birth photo then cut/paste this to your status ... that's < PROPFEMALE > Rodriguez from Lost . also see : < PROPFEMALE > Maines of the < PROPFEMALE > Chicks ( back when my hair was short , spiky and platinum blonde during my late teens-early 20s ) . 
I'm a BIG FAN of the new double-showerhead with handheld sprayer I picked up yesterday . It even has a MIST setting ! However , our freshly-bathed doggy < PROPMALE > is NOT a big fan ... 
Angie : Claims to be anti-social but is the exact opposite . Very beautiful and one of a kind personality . Has fun just about all the time and can make you laugh when you least expect it . Enjoys playing halo and can kick ass in Guitar Hero 3 . Most spectacular/lovable person you could ever meet . 
Excited about today's \Behind the Scenes of the Idaho Legislature\ " workshop @ school . Hopin ' < PROPMALE > Newcomb delivers some juicy gossip . If only it wasn't gonna take 8 hours of this Saturday and next :( " 
I love Puppy Bowl Sunday ! 
Workin ' today 8:30 -5 , class 6-9 , first test in Logic 9 am tomorrow . OH BOY ! 
Probably shouldn't leave the house today . Spent the last 25 minutes cleaning floods in bathroom and kitchen . Bathroom was b/c didn't realize the shower stream was pointed directly at the back wall while I was waiting for the hot water , streaming it right onto the floor . In the kitchen , brewed half the pot across the kitchen floor b/c forgot to put the coffee pot in the coffee maker . FML 
Test # 1 in Logic today . Prof said only 3% of students have any hope of earning an A . I accept your challenge , sir . 
the best part of wakin ' up is snuggling < PROPMALE>'s big chubby rump ! 
hmmm ... n8's home-improving , laundry's done ,... what now ? Start my online Stats test or take Dex for a jog around the neighborhood ? Such tough choices ... 
Another Saturday at school for the last day of Behind the Scenes at the Idaho Legislature . Gotta head out ... NOW ! 
If I hadn't gone to bed at 8:30 pm last night , I would have fallen asleep on the couch at 8:30 pm last night . Me = loser . But I do love gettin ' up early with my boys ! 
OMG came home to a roast cooked 5 out of 6 hours . I could smell it from the street when I got out of my truck . WANT TO EAT ... NOW !!! 
The best things in life are the surprises , no matter how big or small ! 
Nothing's cuter than watching my two boys smile at eachother as they're walkin ' down the street in the morning sunshine ! 
Just got outta school ... gotta love taking a class that includes a hike in the foothills , though ! 
wondering what the HELL I'm doing dinkin ' around on facebook when LOST is supposed to begin ... 
don't wanna read the < PROPFIRST > Hobbes today . over it BLEH !!! 
There's a rooster I've regularly heard crow in the mornings over the last month . I love you , Northwest Boise ! 
Due Thurs : 6 pages comparing and contrasting Locke with Hobbes ' notions of natural right and the implications for what the purpose of government should be . Ugh . A year ago I was so into this shit . 
First day of spring , first sinus headache of spring ! Gotta love feeling hungover without the wild night before to make it worth it . 
LOVE my new clothes steamer . BYE BYE iron , thanks for SUCKING so much time and joy out of my life . 
Dear Sun : If you could start rising around 6 am , or 5:45 or something like that , my doggy & I would really appreciate it . Kthxbye ... 
Upon entering my neighborhood this evening , a crazy looking neighbor was being video taped by his friend while he stood up with his hands to his mouth , shouting something at me while I passed in my truck . i gave them a friendly wave but frankly , I don't know how to respond to that . 
... slowly breathing a sigh of relief ... new renters across the street OWN a lawnmower and have commenced yard work 2 days in a row , despite the fact that it doesn't appear they're fully unpacked yet . Kudos . 
I wish I could download books into my brain . 
Never fails to amaze me how well a jog wakes me up and gets me focused ! 
mmm ... home-made grilled beef & red pepper stir-fry ... i wonder why cooking is so pleasurable ? 
Was in bed watching a movie 12 hours ago .. not sure what time I fell asleep , but it was definitely early . So why do I STILL feel sleepy ? 
It was a special doggy's Day of Beauty today ! Pedicure , BATH and blow-dry -- and all finished by 10:45 AM . He is so FLOOFY right now , I LOVE IT . 
I thought it was really really weird how dark it was outside for being almost 8 am when I woke up this morning . Then I realized my alarm clock ( that has an auto-setting for EVERYTHING ) had made it's own adjustmentss for what used to be the proper night for Daylight Savings . I don't know how to tell it that the human world changed the rules . 
I love it when events go off without a hitch ! 
Today's agenda : hair appointment , test in Stats , and who knows what else ! 
Found a silk dress for $20 . Original Nordstrom's price tag still attached said $250 . I love the Repeat Boutique . 
N8 just came out the bathroom and announced he thinks he has \irritable down syndrome . \"" 
... reason #17 why I love my clothes steamer : it's the easiest fix EVER when \lay flat to dry\ " accidently becomes \ " left in a rumpled mess to dry . \"" 
I'll construct YOUR dilemma , logic test ! 
Just pounded a double sized red bull without even realizing it . I never drink the stuff . This should be interesting ... waiting for jitters to commence ! 
It's gardening prep season ! Got my first bug bite of the year , and some seriously dirty feet . 
After a long day of seed-starting and flower-transplanting , can't wait for our bbq'd teriyaki chicken & yakisoba stir-fry . Smells SOOO GOOD . Also , FYI , that scary-looking bottle in the stores called \Tiger Sauce \"= DELICIOUS . And not spicy like I assumed . " 
Really excited about the monster zit forming on the very tip of my nose . Because the same week we have a 70+ person evening event is the best week ever to get my first-ever monster zit on my nose . And this is probably the second monster zit of my entire life . 
Somehow , whenever it rains , the house smells richly of dog paws . hmm ... 
could someone please tell my body that being wide awake between the hours of 2 am and 4 am is a really bad idea ? 
homemade tzatziki is much tastier when you don't accidentally buy greek yogurt that's honey-flavored . 
Not excited about being in a workshop the next two nights and all day Saturday . However , I am excited that the workshop is about the history and architecture of Boise , complete with walking tour ! 
OMG online stats test + screaming kids playing outside at daycare next door = NOT GOOD TIMES . Forgot what a blessing the quiet of winter was . 
Why is Nate's dog eating the new garden soil ?!?!?!? 
Yay ! It's finally my final final today ! First homework-free summer in three years ! 
Beer cans make excellent pizza dough rollers ! 
Thanks for all the birthday wishes , everyone !!! You are all awesome ! 
Thank you thank you to everyone for the birthday wishes !! I'm getting ready to enjoy some delicious birthday steaks this beautiful < PROPFEMALE > evening ! 
2 < PROPMALE > with < PROPMALE > , check . Shower , check . Breakfast , check . Ready to tackle this gorgeous day . 
high point of a ten-hour day = when an old man takes you by the shoulder , looks you straight in the eye , and declares , \you're SO FRIGGIN ' CUTE . \"" 
Is there a word for when your hands feel weak and heavy like lead and its hard to even hold a fork of spaghetti to your mouth ? Cuz that's what I have after gardening for awhile and holding heavy shovels . 
So there I was , thinking yesterday's marathon , head-splitting sinus headache had passed ... Turns out I was wrong ! yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay ... :( 
Perfectly good morning run RUINED by a loose , uncut , 80 lb pitbull ( I'm guessing he must've been that heavy , since he was as tall as < PROPMALE > with twice the muscle mass ) . Chased us for half an hour while trying to hump & playfight < PROPMALE > before the cops finally arrived . We can accurately describe my condition as \shaken . \"" 
Hit some golf balls & ate some El Gallo Giro with the Halls , and rested in on a lawn chair in the back yard . Pretty nice little Saturday ( if you don't count the dog fiasco ) , even if I didn't make it to the Home Depot . 
Just a lil ' FYI ... Home Depot on State St = WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER . This previously-satisfied household will no longer be giving the chain anymore business as long as they keep people on staff who make it clear that they don't deserve their jobs . 
The only good thing about having to go to Albertson's at 6:30 am for a coffee emergency is that the croissants are still warm from the oven . But on a serious note , how the hell can one household go through 3 broken coffee makers in less than 90 days ??? 
< PROPFEMALE > + < PROPMALE > + 3.5 mile hike in the foothills = Nice lil ' Wednesday night with some of my most favorite company ! 
Had a relaxing 2.5 mile walk with the doggy this morning . It was made even better when , 5 < PROPFEMALE > after being asked by a motorist if I had seen a blonde dog running around , < PROPMALE > spotted a scared , blonde dog hiding by a pile of trash it was digging through . I was then able to flag down the car and reunite \Walter\ " with his papa . So glad for them ! " 
What's worse than knocking heads with your dog so hard you bite your tongue ? When you bite it so hard you mouth keeps filling with blood for 15 minutes . What's worse than that ? When you're already nauseated from hunger , but you're super-queasy around blood ... 
Hugging my big puppy close tonight . Sending love to all those mourning their doggies this week . 
Earned myself a nice , big thumb-blister while practicing my golf swing with the big bro this morning ! 
Nursing a serious pulled hamstring/glute . Sitting is fine , standing is fine , getting from one to the other is excruciating . Perfect day to check a few items off my Netflix Instant Queue and try to sucker n8 into fetching me items as I require them ! 
Love LOVE love the new sidewalks on Catalpa !!! 
My massage therapy appt couldn't come sooner today . Disproportionately sore today in relation to the lightweight stuff I hauled around for a presentation last night . Think I've just gotten weaker from not working out for two weeks straight . This injury is double-punishment now . 
just made pasta tossed with sauteed mushrooms , garlic , onion , and home-grown tomatoes , < PROPMALE > , and oregano . MMMMMMsoFREAKINGOOD . 
Vent time : why does it feel like people who own good dogs get the short end of the stick ? Today I let my dog off leash in a park for 90 seconds where no one was around and he wouldn't bug anyone and I got an f'ing ticket . BUT WHERE THE F #CK were the dog cops all the times we've been attacked by loose dogs ? 
Lots of huge snapped tree limbs along my block . Apparently much of State St was closed due to the same prob last night . Hope everyone's alright and glad we were spared any trouble in that crazy storm ! 
Sunday afternoon chores are much more fun with Sunday afternoon beers . However , I'm going to interpret my aching leg as a sign that I don't * have * to mop this week . 
First day of school . Statistics sucks . Wondering if it will be possible to get a few weeks ahead n homework if I work diligently at home this weekend . I've got football games to go to , people ! 
SOOOOOO bummed to\ 
hear the Vietnamese Restaurant on Franklin/Curtis caught on fire this morning . Hope the damage is\ 
minimal and they will be open & serving their deliciousness again\ 
very soon . 
Someday my leg won't ache & I will run again . That day may not be til Christmas . Or when I finally bite the bullet and cut it off myself . 
The neighborhood kiddos were pretty excited to get to Taft Elementary this AM . An American flag balloon had landed in the schoolyard ! The Broncos balloon was flying overhead at the same time too . 
I could really use some sushi right now . Might need another AYCE night at Yoi Tomo . 
I know a squeaky-clean doggie who is NOT happy with us right now ... 
House is clean . Only thing left to do between now and game time is walk the dog then avoid internet distractions and do my homework . Big thumbs DOWN . GO BRONCOS ! 
So , this weekend I rode in a covered wagon and sat in the cockpit of a Blackhawk helicopter . Pretty effin ' badass ! 
Today n8 and I learned that one of the hazards of having a stainless steel carafe is that you can't see if you forgot to dump yesterday's leftover coffee ... But why was I the one who had to learn that the hard way with cold coffee all over my toes , when n8's the one who forgot to dump the old stuff out ? 
Busy doing unpaid copywriting for a boyfriend who's obsessed with dreaming up the perfect sign to display College Game Day Saturday morning ! 
Today I'm thinking positive : I am naturally good at Stats . I don't need no \textbook\ " to show me HOW to do it . " 
I am going to ACE my Stats test today ... And my leg isn't going to hurt anymore ... And I have winning lottery < PROPFIRST > to use ! 
Sleeping in 2 hours past my alarm wasn't how I wanted to start today , but I'm not sorry it happened . 
It took < PROPMALE > 5 whole years to figure out there's a perfectly comfy bed to lay on in the middle bedroom of the house . 5 years of < PROPMALE > being right at the window when we get home . Now n8 comes home , and where's Dex ? Down the hall , deep in sleep . Really makes you wonder what goes on in that doggy's little pea-brain ? 
Can we delay the 3 day weekend to next week ? That'd fit in a little better with my schedule , kthxbye . 
Bit the bullet , paid the $20 late fee , and applied to graduate in December . I am going to start requiring everyone to address me as < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , Political Scientist . 
Going to Coheed & Cambria tonight ! Can't wait ! 
Gonna eat low-carb as much as possible for awhile , so I got a shiny new grill/griddle/panini press machine thingy for easy indoor cooking of meat . Very excited about it . Time to shed the weight that's been creeping up since getting hurt in July . 
Someone needs to tell the people painting our next door neighbor's house that Honda makes a quieter model paint-sprayer . Keep thinking I hear a woman shrieking in terror . 
It might be time\ 
to do a neighborhood intervention on fugly-painted houses . Especially\ 
GREEN ones . First was an electric green with black trim house , next was\ 
smoky green with disgusting yellow-beige trim ( white would have been\ 
gorgeous ) . House # 3 is now lime green , trim TBD . Oh yeah , and there's also a disgusting candy-banana yellow one down the road . I don't get it . 
I heard my dog bark to be let in the house for the first time ever this morning . 
Today I am grateful for how well thinking about what I do want ( versus what I don't want ) works on my focus and discipline , I'm grateful for my treadmill and for how adorable and cuddly my < PROPMALE > is , even when he wakes me up at 2:30 am for an emergency potty break . 
OMG I love my new indoor grill . Perfect burgers and chicken breasts in 20 < PROPFEMALE > utes ( includes 10 < PROPFEMALE > heating-up time ) . Normally I have to wait 20 < PROPFEMALE > utes for n8 to even turn on the outdoor grill , then another 20 < PROPFEMALE > for him to clean it ...! 
Just found out Electric Six has canceled the rest of their tour . Couldn't be more bummed . 
Wet weather = first giant trail of muddy paw prints going from kitchen to living room to living room furniture . So glad the couch is leather ! 
Today I am grateful for the yoga stretch that relieves my sciatic pain , and for avocados . 
My boys are gonna walk me to the polling place in a few minutes ! 
My doggy bled so I could vote ... picked up some of the worst goatheads I've ever seen , in BOTH front paws . Sorry to the Sherwin < PROPMALE > for all the dog-blood stains on your sidewalk . 
OMG my neighbor is currently mowing the leaves in the street . I'm hoping he is just bored and looking for excuses to not have to help his wife with their in-home daycare . This is a whole new level of ridiculous . 
Quote of the weekend : \I put a hamburger in her tailpipe . NOT literally . \"" 
is it friday is it friday is it friday ???? OMG SO EXCITED !!!! One Week Vacation + My FAV holiday + first time going to Reno + BSU kicking < PROPFEMALE>'s A$$ = AWESOME . 
It's a < PROPFEMALE > & < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > , Cat Stevens , & Bright Eyes kinda day . 
5:16 am and I've been up for an hour . Not sure whether I should be proud or sorry for myself . 
Still chilled to the bone from last night . Sitting over a heat vent trying to thaw and make the journey to Albertson's to replenish necessities such as coffee creamer and donuts . 
What's better than a crappy broken dryer ? A crappy working one for only 60 bones bought out of a back-alley Garden City business ! 
Getting ready to head over for tonight's < PROPMALE > Family Thanksgiving dinner with my folks , then hitting the road for Reno Thanksgiving with the Halls tomorrow ! Can't wait ! And just thin , after 6 years , this is the first Thanksgiving Nate and I will have ever spent together . Aaawwwwwwwww ... 
Just polished off a delicious DIY version of Flying Pie's Zambini pizza , now Nate's at his xbox and I'm settling in for some Netflixin ' . Tomorrow's Saturday , right ? :) 
Woke up with what appears to be a sinus infection . Probably why I've had daily sinus headaches over the last week . Ugh . 
Sick as a dog , but the cold pills have greatly reduced my normal anxiety about driving in snow . Nate said I have to take his truck today , and that he'd shovel the walkway and warm it up for me :) 
I wish stores would let you comment online about what you don't like about their clothes so they could offer better crap that I would actually be interested in buying . This would be my first post : NO , JCPenney , I don't want ANY clothing with glitter or sparkles because I'm a grown-ass woman . 
Just noticed there's a channel playing reruns of \Martin . \ " ... I can finally check THAT off the list of huge voids in my life . " 
Woke up early to \give myself the gift of aerobic exercise\ " but got distracted trying to self-diagnose my swollen tonsil . I poked at the tonsil so much that I gave myself the gift of a sore throat . " 
On second thought , skipping my run this morning due to a < PROPMALE > gut ache may have been counter-productive . 
I am sooooooooooo ready to get my final over with . C'moooon 1pm ! 
Why yes , after sampling a cookie from each of the Boise branches today , I DO need a nap ! 
New neighbors goin ' in across the street . Wonder how long before this couple breaks up and the dude's in jail .. 
Nate just got to be a \hero\ " to the new neighbor . Poor kid locked herself out in her jammies with no shoes/coat and Nate found a window he could pop open and lift her into . We don't know if she has roomies yet but we're breathing a sigh of relief that she seems nice and normal . " 
Yoga videos on Netflix instant = perfect way to relax on a Sunday afternoon from the comfort of my living room ! 
All I want for Chrismas is to watch Christmas movies , listen to Christmas music , and eat cookies . 
Finally found < PROPMALE>'s missing Bronco kerchief . The omens are good . 
Came down w/sinus infection # 2 since Thanksgiving . Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaymerrychristmashappynewyear . 
Will be at the Plank around 8:00 tonight celebrating my big brother's 30th Birthday ! Everyone's invited ! 
Dear family of 10 who walked into oncoming traffic to cross State Street this morning : please do your baby in the stroller a favor and walk the extra 20 ft to THE CROSSWALK next time . kthxbye . 
Just got back from walking < PROPMALE > and bouncing rocks off the iced-over pond at Veteran's Memorial Park . Nate almost got one rock all the way to the other side . Chilly but fun ! 
there's almost no mood nor headache that can't be cured by walking 2 < PROPMALE > around the neighborhood with my boys . 
Toddlers & Tiaras : HILARIOUS entertainment , with a good message . The message ? I'm sooooo not ready for kids !!! 
I'm kinda excited that I get to start my day at a press conference ! The GC Library and GC Library Foundation is announcing a $ 25,000 donation from < PROPFIRST > Meyer . My boss < PROPFEMALE > is the president of the Foundation and I get to take photos ! 
Countdown to camp in Cascade ! Itchin ' to get home tonight and spend some q-time with my boys ! 
Leaving for Cascade in an hour ! Can't wait to get back Monday to my boys and a freshly-tiled kitchen -- Nate bought all this supplies this morning . Have a great weekend everyone ! 
It's good to be home from camp ! Exhausted ... but met so many AMAZING kids and had a total BLAST ! What an incredible experience ! 
Got in a 3 mile workout today , despite not having had a full day off since the 9th ( and won't until the 22nd ) . Maybe those 15 yr old girls ' energy levels rubbed off on me ... 
Text from my dad : \Yur mother has been txting me for the the last hour . She is txt crazy now . \ " Text from my brother : \ " Teaching mom to text . Pretty sure I'm never having kids . \"" 
Thank you , Friday , just for being you :) .... now its time to decide if i want to push myself this weekend to get things done that I couldn't do last weekend , or lay around the house every possible minute . 
I find it delightful that < PROPMALE > LOVES steamed broccoli . 
the upside of living next to an in-home daycare : watching two full-grown men blow kisses at each other from across the street . ( disclaimer : they were trying to get their kids to blow kisses at eachother ) 
Came home from work with piriformis pain . Broken furnace ended up being an even worse pain in the @$$ . I would from hereon advise all homeowners to NEVER replace their thermostat themselves . 
Just did an awesome 3.5 mile walk around the block . February , keep these gorgeous days a'comin'! 
Today's Google doodle is my favorite EVER . 
I would like to thank my coworkers for sharing their cold with me just in time for what's supposed to be a 50-degree beautiful weekend :) 
Coughing , sneezing , < PROPMALE > aching , temp at 99.9 . I've officially upgraded to \flu . \""
