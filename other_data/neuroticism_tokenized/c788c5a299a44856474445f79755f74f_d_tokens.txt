always the one thats left behind , broken and forgotten ... 
I might hug other guys , i might laugh with other guys , i might even < PROPFEMALE > out with other guys .. but none of them will ever mean to me as much as you do . 
ughh !! i just have to make it threw like 27 more days and hopefully everything will change ... just 27 more days ...

the 1st time you fall in love changes your life forever , & no matter how hard you try the feeling never goes away <3 
to love someone deeply gives you strength , being loved by someone gives you courage :) 
Everyone always tells me how mature i am and how responsible but then when it comes down to proving that i am no one allows me to make my own decisions ... awesomeeeee 
im screwed im never ganna finish this project !!!!!! 
this weekend went by to fast :/ 
awhh i really regret not going this year :( i hope things will work out next year though :) 
im sorry i speak the truth and call people out when i think its necessary , but i stopped caring ... im ganna speak my mind and tell the truth , thats all i have to say im done holding back how i feel just to please others because its hurting me now . 
Had an amazing weekend :) it was nice to get to escape haha it felt like we were living summer camp haha that's what < PROPMALE > Frost said :) lol Had a nice time seeing my long lost friends and getting to chill with my baby :) and having frosty to keep things interesting :P lol
