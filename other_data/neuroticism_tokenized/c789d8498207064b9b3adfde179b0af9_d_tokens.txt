Sick tired sore and generally out of it . For those of you I have ... er ... not talked to in a while and likely never look at this ... I have been really sick . I got that blasted H1N1 crap . Really annoying by the way . BUT I am slowly getting better <3 Yay ! I just cant wait to stop coughing . 

Other than that ... I have a < PROPFEMALE > named Meela now ... she was a kitten when I got her this summer but I'd venture to say that a few months later she is kitten no longer . Meela is currently hunting lady bugs . 
Just wanting to thank everyone for the happy birthday wishes <3 Much love to all . 
Ended up not going to class today . Not because I wanted to skip but because I have no pants .... Literally no pants and they just finished drying . No way in hell I'd make it for class . 
O.o Squirrels be eating my pumpkins >.> 
I've scheduled my classes for next semester and(aside from the extra class that I need to find as a just-in-case class ) I dont have class till 11:30 every day AND I am taking 3 classes that amount to 13 credit hours . Wowie zowie ! Just need to figure out what my extra no-brainer class will be * ponders * where does one go for a list of classes ?

Bleh ... I got a D in Calculus . I am ok with my B in french but .... Le-Sigh . I have to retake that hellish class . -.-;;; Hopefully it goes better next time ... However my gpa of 2.85 is enough to get into the school of science SO ! hey if I do well next semester and bump that grade up I should be < PROPFEMALE > . ^^ Here's hopin . I just need this one damn credit and a decent GPA and I can get my arse where I want to be .

Finished Reading Society of S and now I am reading Graceling . I love good books <3 . 
Even with a couple hours worth of breaks I'm 222 pages into Graceling and cant put it down o.o !!!! Halp I cant sleep . It speaks to me when I try <,<;;;; 
Mwahahahahahaha >.> I finished it ... And no ... I havent slept yet . I have a feeling break is going to be hell on my sleeping schedule what with all my lovely books to keep me up at all hours . >.> I can't decide if I should hope some of them aren't so good or not ... 
Sick and tired of being sick and tired . When will it end !?! 
I are prettyfied . And still has 3 more days to enjoy my prettyfication phase . Voot ! 
1 . Not a cat person . Saying this because I spent two hours with one and that was probably one of the things he got most excited about . ( I find snakes and dogs much more exciting though I love my cat to death ) . 2 . If first date doesnt make me say \I cant wait to see them again\ " There will not be a date number two 3 . I hope to never repeat the hours between 4 and 6 today . Thank goodness it isn't groundhog day . " 
I think it would be ungodly fun to go sing karaoke . Granted ... i likely wouldnt know any modern songs but hey ! Haha . 
So my mom apparently goes to Wainright Middle School >.> So says a random person texting her . I KNEW I was the adult !!!!! 
* blinks * So yes ... you know that date rant ... The subject of said date rant just sent me a message . And I kid you not his ' salutation ' at the end was ' Meow ' then his name . Um ... yeah ... he's 25 . o.o ; WTF ? 
There's nothing like sitting in a Chemistry class and realizing that yes ... yes that is where I have wanted to be ever since I arrived at Purdue ... The book is even a good read >.>; Shh I already know my nerd is showing :p 
Oi my legs hurt ... I have been half-runnin all day long . Oddly enough I kinda like this ' oh god my legs need to fall off ' feeling . Haha ! \ 
Tonight is first night of work O.O ; 10pm-2am . I wonder how much of a zombie I'll be tomorrow O.o ;;; 
Woke up and started crying today . Kinda feeling pathetic and lonely . Annd so I am ranting about it . Kinda feel like it's my fault though , I think I haven't exactly been there for peeps lately . -.-; Sorry if that's the case . 
Dear Bookshelf fairy :\ 
Please make my bookshelves grow . I hate putting books on their side but I've officially run out of bookshelf space without rearranging them . \ 
\ 
It would be much appreciated , \ 
~ E\ 
( Some people when not 100% binge eat ... apparently I binge book-bye ) 
Making chicken noodle soup entirely from scratch tonight . Mom has an upset tummy and we didn't have noodles so those are from scratch too . >.> Yay ! Haha . 
Duuuuuuuude ! Totally diggin my job ! Today I got to look at the books and make sure they were properly shelved . I have been told it is the un-fun part of the job but what they dont understand is that the lil OCD in me is screaming YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY ! For getting to put all the < PROPFIRST > in the right order . >.> I could have done it for hours ! 
Thinkin that I would love to make pasta again , though perhaps I will dry some/freeze some . If we dont take g-ma home this weekend that might be my project . 
I am so tired o.o I feel like my job has sucked the life out of me for the day hah ! Working till 2 am is great . But waking up the next day sucks ass . I just realized that I signed up to work on a friday . So I get to try and work on this ' OhgodImSotired-mode ' . Ah well $.$ I'll be okay xD 
* is unimpressed with this ' snow storm ' * 
* shakes fist at purdue * Extend the snowday till 10am ? What the heck ? That does me NO good ! 
I have been enjoying my new camera <3 
-.- Tiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiired ! xD But had a fun/productive/active night . Woot ! 
Probably taking G-ma home next weekend ... not sure that I will be able to go what with work and all . 
for the first time in my life I wish I didnt have chemistry today . Oi ... I feel so sick :( 
Feelin like a zombie ... even after sleeping till 12 I feel like I have been hit by a truck . 
Wanting to write but not liking what I am writing ... or rather ... I had an idea and now my story wants to write itself differently ... 
Feeling like my chem exam could be a < PROPMALE > fail moment . Damn nuclear Chemistry -.- 
Done with chemistry exam !!!!! So happy now ! 
So I don't think I an necessarily the Worst at fashion but I certainly wouldn't ask me for advice either . Yet today someone stopped me to ask where I got my boots . I had to tell her they were mens boots from walmart haha . Wanna know the best part ? She was an older woman possibly from sweeden . Yep ... I am a fashion consultant to 60+ foreign peeps go me . Lmao 
Yahooooooooooooo ! Prepare for a dorky moment but I feel like I've just been asked out on a date . It's that giddy I want to squeal elation thing going on . * dances * I just got an appointment for a violin lesson . <3 Sooooo freggin happy ! 
Just went out for a drive not long ago . Nothing beats having the windows down , driving through the country with music blaring at night . Plus fullish < PROPFEMALE > = added bonus . Was fun , and now that it's quiet in the house I am feeling so much more like me and < PROPMALE > stress factor has flown away . 
Nervous about next week . I know it's silly to be freaking out about it but I keep getting excited and then freaked out about violin lessons . It's yay and then ohmygodwhatifitsnotfun ?!? yep .... I am weird . Pretty sure I'll love it though despite my freaking out ... o.o ;; not even two days though !!! I CANT WAIT !! 
Yahoo !!! Well let me just say this , I LOVE the violin . I absolutely suck ( but that's expected ) and yet I still made some perdy notes tonight . Hah ! I am addicted . Already I am super sad I don't have one to practice on . I shall hopefully change that tomorrow . I may have tried a lot of things over the years , but this is the first time that I've been as excited to do something as when I want to cook something new . 
Watching Leap Year ~ Wanting to practice the violin ~ \ 
By the way Blockbuster is closing ... they has a sale nao . 
Blueberry 
My violin is way out of tune thanks to my new fear of tuning it . HAH ! Ah well still fun to mess around with . Sadly I keep having to play this short pattern of notes over and over because without an A string I am a bit limited ( I only was given things to practice on A and E ) So ... cant wait for tomorrow . i am A-string bound ! And now because I cant resist ... xD At least I didn't break my G-string ;P 
Sick today -.- 
I can kind of play Twinkle Twinkle Little < PROPFEMALE > now ... Kind of ... there's some screeching and hesitation between notes ( not BAD just < PROPFEMALE > noises ) but I think I'll make some progress tonight when I practice . >.> Super excited ! 
So my arms are super tired after practicing . I think it got to the point where my playing was getting worse because I was tired hah . Ah well my goal next time is to relax my jaw and just in general . Especially my jaw though .. for what ever reason I clench it when practicing o.o clenched jaw = headache/jaw ache 
How to stay awake while studying for an exam ~ Pandora blasting in your ears works just fine >.> So help me I am so unable to focus at the moment ... I hope this exam goes fast >.> 
Considering making a youtube thing for my violin practices ... Then I would know how long I am practicing ... and could hear progressess/fails what do peeps think ? 
Bad news mes amis .... An hour long video of practice refuses to upload annnnd I am no where near capable/patient enough to edit it . SORRY ! But who knows maybe mom will ? hahahaha * is so bad * 
Seriously I had better have awesome arms from violin o.o They feel like rubber when I stop practicing xD 
I hate being so tired I can't practice the violin for long . -.- It's sad ... At the moment I want to but dizzy while standing hardly seems like a good situation for playing . o.o * sniffles * Where's the get well < PROPFEMALE > ? 
So yes ... I feel like I've just been molested . Nothing like logging on FB and having 10 pokes ... o.o >.>;;;;; \ 
By the way MY BREAK JUST STARTED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
My arm feels like jello ... it was NOT happy with tonights violin practice . I feel like my tutor wants me to be bendy girl at this point . 
Actually debating on making bread ... O.o yep ... 5 am and I am thinking about cooking rather than bed after the night I had . Go me . 
Lovin my violin mute .... I can practice at 1 am and no one knows ! * evil grin * >.> 
I am suuuuper excited ! Apparently I've somewhat exceeded the expectations of my tutor in how fast I've picked up the violin ! Woot ! * shoves sleeves up her arms * That just means I'll have to kick it up another notch ... I gotta keep her guessing after all ! * dances * 
I am so happy at the moment ... like ... super happy . Giggly stupidly happy even . I like it <3 . * hums * Only think I am not happy about is I cant practice my violin * sad face * but that's okay ... prolly'll just practice a few hours extra tomorrow . YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY !
