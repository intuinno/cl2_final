Peace , Love , and Happiness . 

It's monday . And I'm not at work . :)

is still waiting for that energy from the crossseal class I was promised to kick in . Right now I just want to take a nap !

Just got back from the Toledo Zoo . So cool ! A great kids area . Greyson loved the rhino's and elephants and giraffes ... anything he can recoginze from his animal books . A great way to exhaust the kids ! 
Cancer is a vile , deceitful , hateful , evil bi *** , and I hate it . And wish it would die forever . 
6 footers on Lake MI this weekend :( . I'm trying to squeeze the last bit of juice out of summer , and the weather is not cooperating ! 
4 days and nights on the boat may be a bit much for me . 2 days -- good . 
No one should die because they cannot afford health care , and no one should go broke because they get sick . If you agree , please post this as your status for the rest of the day . 
It's good to be home . I need to relax before the kids come tomorrow ! 
Dropped crying baby off at Daycare , check . Met with my writing classes , 30 , 32 , and 38 students each , check . Met with my Psychology classes , 15 !, 29 , and 32 students each , check . Met with principal , councelors , and department to discuss the inability to alleviate these < PROPFIRST > , check . Took 4 Motrin , check . Welcome back ! Here we go again ... 
Dropped baby at Daycare , no crying :) , check . Met with english classes , 30 , 34 , and 38 , check . Met with psych classes 16 , 25 , and 34 , check . Apologized to students sitting on the floor , check . Met with principal , councelor , and department to varify that there is nothing they can do , check . Replaced Motrin with alcohol , check . 
Dropped baby at daycare , no crying ! Met with english classes , 29 , 34 , and 37 , down 2 ! ( going ... ) . Met with psych classes , 15 , 24 , and 34 , down 2 more ! ( going ... ) . Home on a Friday night with a bottle of white , boy in my lap , and Shrek on the tube , ( gone ! ) 
Still recovering from the shock of defending our home from two GIGANTIC spiders last night . I haven't seen any this big since my trip to < PROPFEMALE > with < PROPFEMALE > ! I swear they were the size of ... I don't know , a pringle ! ( I'm trying not to exaggerate , here . ) And for a spider in MI , that's BIG ! I still feel a little sick thinking about it . 
Watching Glee . Too cute ! And great music . I just sang some Heart along with < PROPFEMALE > Chenoweth and ... whoever the glee geek is . ( It's a good thing I'm \alone . \ " Get it ? \ " Alone ? \")" 
Is there a game this weekend ? 
Shopping for new cell phone provider . Had Alltell for the past 5 years or so . Great signal in our house . No longer . Cell phones are our only phones . They need to work in our house . Any suggestions for great coverage ( from experience , not advertising ) and good deals ? 
loves Glee . And is too invested in that poor councelor who so obviously does not want to marry that guy ! 
Oh my gosh . The mohawk kid is singing ... < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > ! AND he's ... not bad ! Love me some < PROPFEMALE > .

I'm greatful that this sore throat turned into a lost voice right in the middle of parent teacher conferences . Those who may have yelled at me thought I was too pathetic to bother ! 
Is thankful for the 1/2 day off so I can spend the afternoon with my boys . 
is greatful for my husband , who planned the best surprise weekend away for our anniversary . Wine tours , a night at a B&B in South Haven , a trip to Saugatuck , antiquing . He is greatful that my voice still hasn't returned . It was a quiet trip ! 
is thankful that my son has a safe , fun place to spend his days . Having terrific daycare really takes some of the stress away from being away from your child during the workday . He is happy to be there everyday . Thank you < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > ! 
is thankful for the modular building that let me crank away the wall between my classroom and the empty room next door . It may not have solved my < PROPFIRST > problems , but it gives each of my students a desk between the two now-joined rooms !

is thankful that my husband and family made it through the last week . The loss of two grandfathers , and two funerals on the same day is not something that anyone should have to experience . 
is thankful for support and love that people freely extend when they see those in need around them . You are all a blessing . Thank you . 
is thankful for < PROPMALE>'s Night Lights . And real live reindeer ! We took Greyson tonight and it was a hit ! He loved the lights ( the dragon was his favorite ) and we couldn't tear him away from the reindeer . We had to bribe him with an elephant ear . 
is thankful that Avatar lived up to the hype . What a great film ! Even in 3-D ( I was skeptical) ! Good story , GREAT special effects . Worth the money to see it on the big screen . 
is thankful that it's a Monday morning , and I'm cuddling my boy and watchin Happy Feet ! And I can do it again tomorrow ! And the next day , too !

Went out for NYE for the first time in years . Had a great time . Thanks < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > !

white 
is greatful for snow that not only makes the world clean , white and beautiful , but also grants me an extra morning of cuddling with Greyson .

I'll step up to a challenge from a friend ... I am out to prove that 80% of my friends will repost , I hope I am right ! Let's lift up His name and make a statement ! Sadly 97% of Facebook Users will not repost this ... when Jesus died on the cross he was thinking of you . If you are one of the few 3% repost this message 
is greatful to Apocolypse Man for feeding into my paranoia , sharing key information for my survival after a holocaust , and keeping me frightfully entertained while Greyson naps , and I do laundry . ( new ? history channel program ) 
Ladies , your red , black , pink , blue , white , butterflied , cheetah printed , and clear bra colors made the channel 4 SLC news last night(Salt Lake City , Utah ) . Facebook doesn't know who started it going but the < PROPFEMALE > B Koman foundation says it was a great way to raise awareness for breast cancer . Way to go !

Sick boy kept us up last night , sinus issues and vomiting . But on the bright side , < PROPFIRST>'s been off work , so has used the time to work on the basement kitchen , and put slide out racks in my mostly useless , ginormous pantry upstairs ! I found food I didn't know was there for the last few years ! Okay , that was kinda sickening ... 
Greyson is finally sleeping on the couch . < PROPFIRST > is sleeping in the bed . We've all been up all night being sick . Thank heavens for Grandma < PROPFEMALE > coming over this morning until Greyson went down for his nap . I don't know what sick mama and daddy would have done !

Had an eventful snowmobiling trip over the weekend . It was great to visit with friends , but I was so happy to see Greyson when we got back . 
loves craigslist . < PROPFIRST > found a box filled with wooden < PROPFIRST > the Train tracks for $25 . We just spent the last 1/2 hour making a double decker track for Greyson , who is now happily playing in his room . Once again , obsessed with the < PROPFIRST > table he got for Christmas . 
Does anyone remember < PROPFEMALE > Mannor from CCHS history ? She used to teach English . I remember that she used to raise < PROPFIRST > horses , and I want one . Thought I'd look her up and pick her brain . Anyone know how I can reach her , or if she's even still in the area ? 
Lovely day ... 
Today's game - PLACE OF BIRTH ! You will find it interesting to know where your FB friends birth places are . Copy & paste this on your profile , then put your place of birth at the end of this sentence . Yes , there really is a KALAMAZOO , MI . 
Checking out a < PROPFIRST > mare tomorrow in Pinckney . Wish me luck !

Snow . Really . 
Just had my first ride on my very own horse ! yea ! She did pretty well for all the changes ( brand new saddle/bridle/rider/arena ) . 
Good good day . Breakfast at The Eagles , at the barn for 3 hours this afternoon , grilling for dinner , playing with Greyson in the yard . And sump pump fixed ! Thanks , < PROPFIRST > . It's so good to have you home ! 
Cold outside , but I'm completely warm ! Went for a ride already this morning ;) 
So , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is getting his 8th divorce , and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > is possibly getting married for a 9th time . < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > and Tiger Woods are , well ... you know ... Even Newt Gingrich is on his 3rd marriage . Yet the idea of same-sex marriage is what is going to destroy the institution of marriage ? REALLY ?!? Feel free to copy and paste if you agree . 
A rainy birthday is the perfect time to curl up on the couch with my little boy ! Thanks for the wishes everyone ! 
I might not be pretty or sexy , might not have the perfect body or be beautiful .. I might not be anyones first choice either , but I'm ME ! I don't pretend to be somebody else . Might not be proud of some of the things I've done , but I'm proud of who I am today !! Copy this and post it to your profile if you live your life being you and you are proud of it !!! 
Got back from the zoo and children's museum in indianapolis tonight . What a ride ! Greyson's head was just spinning . And we forgot a camera ... 
Mothers ' Day declaration ~ I wanted you before you were born . I loved you when you were born , I saw your face and I knew that I was in love . Before you were an hour old , I knew I would die for you . To this day , I will . This is the miracle of life . \ 
Put this on your status if you have children you love more than life . I sure do ! I count my blessings everyday ! HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY TO ALL OF YOU ! 
Home again with sick boy . :( Poor baby has rotovirus . 
So , Greyson hasn't thrown up since yesterday morning's incident . He ate , drank , and filled diapers just fine . So now I think the Dr. was wrong . Not the rotovirus . So now I'm paranoid that he ingested something ... 
Well , whatever it is has moved to his bowels . He can't even sit down ! Poor baby has gone through more diapers in the past two days that he usually does in a week ! One person suggested Kaopectate . Any other parents out there have luck with anything else ? He's only 2 1/2 ... 
Isn't it funny how your kid can want nothing to do with you until you pick up the phone ? The next time I want Greyson's attention I'm going to fake a phone call . 
Question : Why is it , do you think , that < PROPFEMALE > regularly chooses the weaker singer ? Do we have low self-esteem ? 
is excited for So You Think You Can Dance tonight ! I love this show ! And I Know I Can't Dance ! 
A week and a half . 
Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work . \

So You Think You Can Dance . What ?!!! No top 20 ?!! Are you kidding me ?!! I change my mind 5 times before the top 10 ! This stinks .

Ahhh . Slept in until 7 , when Greyson woke up on his own . Having a coffee while he has breakfast . Then off to Daycare and school . A teacher's work is never done . Not even during summer . 
So , one boy exhausted from playing outside all day who falls asleep before 8 pm = one boy wide awake and ready to play at 6 am . sigh . 
What a perfect day for a horse show ! Just watched , but so neat . Came home to a lesson , and a pool party in the front yard with our really cool neighbors . ( Greyson loves Savannah ... or Stabanna ) Terrific start to the summer ! 
Happy Father's Day to all you terrific Dads . Your role in the lives of your children is so integral to their self-esteem , approach to work and life , and future relationships . Thank you for being there for your sons and daughters . I love you , < PROPFIRST > . Greyson adores you . And I love you , Pops . Because of your awesome example , I waited a LONG time to find a man as great as you !

Week 1 ( or three , because I got a late start ) down for my couch to 5k training ! Feeling good . We'll see how I feel next week ! 
just got back from Bras That Fit with my mom . Who knew they made a FF ???? I'll never buy a bra from anyone else again . After years , my cleavage is finally back where it belongs ! Ladies , I can't give a more enthusiastic recommendation . 
Step 2 slide and climb : free ( from aunt Em ) . Pop-up canvas barn : $20 ( < PROPFIRST > Deere ) . Rebounder trampoline : $10 ( Lake Columbia Garage Sales ) . Finished basement big enough to house all three , plus a 2 1/2-year-old frantic to \go outside to play\ " when it is 97 degrees out : priceless . Thanks to God and < PROPFIRST >!!!" 
Just had kapusta . Love Grandma's recipe ! 
So , Greyson wanted to wear his Buzz Lightyear training pants this morning . I asked him to try the potty ( no joy ) , and put the pants on . I said , \Now remember to tell mommy when you have to go potty . \ " He nodded . No kidding . Not 30 seconds later Buzz was drowning . " 
finally got to read her first novel of the summer . < PROPFEMALE > Roberts . Nothing like a mindless romance !

This week remember all babies born sleeping or whom we have carried but never met , or those we have held but couldn't take home or the ones that came home but didn't stay . Make this your profile status if you or someone you know has suffered the loss of a baby . The majority won't do it ,... baby loss is still a taboo subject . Break the silence .

I loved you the minute you were born . Then I saw your face and fell in love some more . You were only a minute old but I knew I would die for you , and to this day I still would .

I am grateful for Glee . It makes me smile even when it's miserably cold and rainy outside , and I'm getting sick . And it's really cute the way Greyson dances to the music :)

is grateful for the short week that will finish up with days of food and family . 
is trying really hard to be thankful . Here goes . I'm thankful that being in bed with a fever and lungs full of fluid means I DIDN'T gain 5 lbs in one day . I'm thankful for my Dad , who rushed over at the last minute to make me chicken noodle soup when I hurt too much to get out of bed .

Happiness is always a by-product . It is probably a matter of temperament , and for anything I know it may be glandular . But it is not something that can be demanded from life , and if you are not happy you had better stop worrying about it and see what treasures you can pluck from your own brand of unhappiness . \

I hope to see this ... in the status of all my friends . 
Well , I lost my built in babysitter . My mom broke her leg . We'll see exactly how much we depend on her now that she's out of commission ! Poor , poor Grandma ! 
I'm having a hard time with the fact that Glee is doing a Beiber episode before a Midler episode . I think I might be ... losing faith .

I am a State/Public employee . I am not the problem . I followed the rules . Your community's Corrections employees , school teachers , police officers , paramedics , firefighters , street and highway workers , and others are NOT the enemy . We live here , pay taxes , work hard , and are trying to support our families , too . If you are a State/Public employee copy and repost . 
is reminiscing ( with herself ) about old friends . I guess I should call it ruminating . Or maybe drinkin ' and thinkin ' .

Alaska AFL-CIO president < PROPMALE > Beltrami : “I think it boils down to whether you believe that unions are looking out for the middle class and workers or if you believe that corporate interests , whose < PROPMALE > motivation is profit , [ are ] working for employee interests . That is a notion to me that is ludicrous . ” 
I think computer viruses should count as life . I think it says something about human nature that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive . We've created life in our own image . \

The Girl you just called fat ? She has been starving herself & has lost over 30lbs . The Boy you just called stupid ? He has a learning disability & studies over 4hrs a night . The Girl you just called ugly ? She spends hours putting makeup on hoping people will like her . The Boy you just tripped ? He is abused enough at home . There's a lot more to people than you think . Put this as your status if you're against bullying .

Lost Gram last night . Praying for Grandpa . 
Like my friend , < PROPFEMALE > , I am having a hard time holding my tongue . And I should stop reading the comments uninformed people make in response to MLive articles .
