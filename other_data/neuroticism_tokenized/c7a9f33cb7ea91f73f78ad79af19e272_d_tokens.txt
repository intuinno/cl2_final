My dad died . Keep my family in your prayers . 

Silently weeping the loss of my father . It's been almost a week now since his passing . 
wants to go home 
I hope everyone has a very happy and prosperous 2011 ! 
Just had my final rehearsal with the chorus . < PROPFEMALE > sob . 
I am officially in Tulsa ! 
I sent < PROPFEMALE > Doolittle a message on facebook . I wonder if she'll reply ... 
misread a facebook post and thought my sister < PROPFEMALE > was coming to Tulsa . It's actually another < PROPFEMALE > that is . I about roadtripped it to California ! haha ;) 
is ready to move into his new apartment now , but has to wait until the 20th ! Argh ! 
Is it foolish to hold onto an email from a now deceased friend for 8 years ? 
Ugh . I need to come up with $122 uber fast so I can get electricity on in my new apt . Thoughts ? 
Signed my lease today . Finally my own apt ! I move in tomorrow . Should I register for homewarming gifts somewhere ? lol ;) 
The healthcare < PROPMALE > passed . Take that republicans ! lol ;) 
So < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > finally confirmed what the world knew all along ........ he's gay . So I guess it's true , all the hot men are gay ;) 
The Humane Society of Tulsa is next to a Whataburger . Why does this scare me ? 
< PROPFEMALE > Lauper on Celebrity Apprentice is so childlike , but I absolutely adore her ! She's so sweet and I have a new found appreciation for her . 
It's offically May ! You know what that means ? 11 more days til my birthday ! ;) 
I got a fraudulent < PROPMALE > banking email that actually had a link to the real < PROPMALE > website to report fraud . Is it just me or are phishers getting stupider ? 
Have you tasted < PROPFEMALE > White's muffin lately ? 
Gotta love < PROPFEMALE > White's Wonderful Wizard of Ass ! lol 
Go figure . Just 5 months ago there was no Cricket coverage in my hometown and along the roads , now they have it ! I was only able to go online in 3 cities along my 10-12 hour ride ! 
May you forever rest in peace < PROPFEMALE > Horne . Another great of the generation before mine has passed . Heaven's soundstage truly gained another amazing talent . 
At the dog park with my dog . My goodness ! There are some good looking dog owners in Tulsa ! lol 
Thank you everyone for your birthday blessings ! I think I got one of the biggest blessings today , my A/C was fixed ! :) Overall it was a good day :) 
Before I forget , my nephew < PROPMALE > made me a cake for my birthday . He was so excited about it ! Thanks again < PROPMALE > ! :) 
It's storming outsie and my poor dog is terrified ! He's cuddling up really close to me ! Gotta love cuddling with a nearly 60lb dog ! 
I almost slept through another Tornado Warning ! There's a storm right now that is capable of producing a tornado . 
This storm is getting real bad . Strong winds , hail , etc . 
Watching Legally Blonde on TV . They censored the word sperm and replaced it with seed . Since when is sperm an inappropriate word ? 
With me working in a call center environment , one would think I could be sympathetic and nice when I call my cell phone company . Perhaps I get too annoyed when they read off a script ? When I ask a yes or no question and get a 3 < PROPFEMALE > report , it's a bit annoying for sure . 
Just saw the trailer for the new karate kid movie . Why do I want to vomit at the thought of a ripped 8 year old ? 
Is it just me or does the guy in the 5 Hour Energy commercial look like he's a gay porn < PROPFEMALE > ? lol 
My dog sure is weird . He loves pita bread ! At least he's eatting healthy ! lol 
I truly don't understand Republicans at times . They speak of smaller government and want the government to stay our of our families ' lives , yet they want to deny the GLBT community the right to marry someone of the same sex . Am I wrong or does this go against what they stand for in those instances ? Gotta love hypocrites ! 
Ugh . Abdominal pain is keeping me up . The pain started Tuesday , thought it was gallstone pains . Today ( Wednesday , though technically Thursday ) I called off work thinking I could relieve the gallstone pain . Well the pain moved to my lower right abdomen . I sure hope the pain eases up before work . If not , it looks like I'll be missing another day of work and heading to the hospital . 
Had an appendectomy . Currently in recovery . Certainly not a fun experience . 
Being given a notice of a mandatory bug spray by your apt complex the day before the spray is totally uncool ! 
Why yes , I am hilarious ! Thank you for noticing ! 
Legalizing gay marriage will lead to legalizing dog marriage . This can be inferred from the history of other political initiatives . For example , when women got the right to vote in 1920 , it led to terriers voting in 1925 , and when Title IX was passed in 1972 to prevent sex discrimination in public schools , resulting in the creation of athletic opportunities for girls , it led to Bichon Frises on the basketball court . 
Ever look back at people you thought were attractive when you were younger and think , \What was I thinking ? They have the face of a goblin ! \"?" 
So last night before bed I saw a little bit of < PROPFIRST > Kimmel talking about \The Bachelorette . \ " Well apparently I also had missing the < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > concert in Chicago in mind as well . These 2 things merged together and you DO NOT want to know what kind of dream I had ! lol " 
stressed 
Don't ask , don't tell has finally been declared unconstitutional . It's about time ! :) 
The current temperature is 57 degrees . I'm certainly not in Oklahoma anymore ! I missed Illinois . :-) 
< PROPFIRST > Tosh sure can be funny . \Do you know who likes to be fisted ?........................... Sock puppets ! \"" 
So far Glee has been awesome ! The voices of the 2 new characters are amazing ! 
Goodbye summer , I'll miss you . See you again in about 9 months , provided that bitch winter doesn't take up all of spring's time again ! I wonder if autumn's gonna be cool this year .... 
watching SNL on Hulu . OMG .... the most recent episode is hilarious ! \Gay wedding at the new Mosque near Ground Zero with a pregnancy termination lounge ! ' This could happen . ' This message brought to you by the RNC and 70% of the DNC . \ " Soooooo wrong ! " 
watching \Glee\ " and omg ....... \ " Baby One More Time\ " sounds so different when the person singing it actually has talent and their voice isn't altered by a computer ! " 
OMG ! \Glee\ " is totally make fun of Youtube stars ! \ " Leave < PROPFEMALE > alone ! \ " \ " Is this real life ? \ " I wonder what's next .... \ " Got a map ? \ " lol " 
Oh yeah , < PROPFEMALE>'s songs sound sooooo much better when someone else is singing lol 
Learning AS400 for my job . Sure wish we used it with my last job at Alorica . It would have saved so much time and prevented a lot if headaches ! I'm sure some if not all that still work there would agree . 
I think Champaign/Urbana is in need of a gay men's chorus . Amasong is here , a lesbian chorus . Perhaps I can get one started somehow . 
Wow . Glee tonight made me speechless . Such an emotional episode tonight . I could almost cry . I lost my own father a year ago . This episode really touched me personally and spiritually . 
Taking call center calls from home is so convenient ! No transportation costs to get to work ! 
I must be crazy . I'm already debating what to get my mother for Christmas . The one thing I can think of right now would make her cry for days ! I tend to aim to make my mother cry when I get her a gift . It shows it was a good gift . ;-) 
Beware the < PROPFEMALE > Bobbit virus . It'll turn your hard drive into a 3.5 \ floppy . :-p " 
I'm sorry , but muscles developed from carrying around your fat does not make you muscular . 
Wow . Once midnight hit , the floodgates opened and the tears poured out . I lost my father a year ago and today ( October 14th ) would have been his 60th birthday . I sure do miss him and have some things left unsaid . Today will be hard but I'm sure I'll make it through . 
Today is Spirit Day when we honor those who took their life from being bullied for either being or being perceived as gay , lesbian , and transgendered . I too was a victim of bullying and harassment in my teens based on my perceived sexuality ( I had not come out at that point in time ) . This is surely something that hits home to all those within the GLBT community . 
Just read about the < PROPMALE > McCance thing . That just makes me sick to my stomach ! He's certainly not human or Christian ! 
hmmmm . it must be asian college girl day at the mall here . an entire flock just got off the bus . 
Coloring/bleaching my hair blonde for my costume tonight . Am I crazy ? ;-) 
Wow ! I look different ! I'll be sure to post costume pics later :) 
so many wild costumes on campus tonight ! 
CNN is projecting < PROPMALE > will win . I sure hope that projection is wrong ! 93% have been reported and < PROPMALE > only leads by 2% ( 82,414 votes ) . Close races like this are why everyone should get involved and vote ! Illinois will not be the same if < PROPMALE > actually wins . A republican governor ? We're screwed .... again . 
Looks like < PROPFIRST > is back in the lead again . This sure is one tight race ! 
I have a confession to make ..................... my dog is a peanutbutter cookie thief ! He doesn't care if they're stale or not , he'll swoop in and steal them when you least suspect it ! 
I'll admit it ! The spoof of Twilight that The Simpsons did was HILARIOUS ! 
OMG . He-Man is on hulu ! I know where my weekend is going ! lol 
The blonde is now gone ! 
munchin on a buttercream frosted cookie . yummy ! 
Illinois Rep. Stephens is an idiot . Blaming homosexuality for the downfall of civilizations ? Get real dude ! 
Civil Union < PROPMALE > in the Illinois House passed ! 
It's snowing ..... It's beautiful , but I HATE the cold ! lol 
Oh the weather outside is frightful , and a fire would be so delightful , and since i've no place to go , no more snow no more snow no more snow ! 
Nothing says ' I'm sorry my doppelganger from another universe tried to kill ' you like flowers . 
A coworker of mine typed the worst thing in company chat . Very bad typo alert !!!! ( I've expanded the abbreviations)\ 
\ 
******* 3:40 pm : in after call work raping up a customer inquiry 
For a while there I was offended by the use of X-mas . I just read that X is the Greek abbreviation for Christ . How about that ! Thank you wikipedia ! 
The TV show \Psyche\ " totally stole my personal philosphy of wearing clothes with brand names on them1 \ " I refuse to advertise for a company and not get paid for it . \"" 
I would like to wish all my friends and family a very < PROPFEMALE > Christmas . I will be spending my day reflecting on the true reason for the season , the birth of Christ . Joyeux < PROPFIRST > ! Feliz Navidad ! < PROPFEMALE > Christmas ! 
Having a traditional Jewish Christmas dinner for lunch ...... General Tso's chicken , pork fried rice , and a pork egg roll . 
Just so everyone knows ..... the saying is \Happy New Year\ " and not \ " Happy New Years . \ " You're wishing someone a new year that is happy . Just a little FYI ;-) " 
Is it just me or is the Republican stance on \Obamacare\ " a bit hypocritical ? They say they don't like that the law requires certain people to pay for healthcare but yet they pushed hard to privatize Medicare Part D which requires people ( who want coverage ) with a fixed income to pay for those plans . " 
Nope . I will not do that . I will not copy your post as my own to show support of whatever it is . The vast majority of those weren't for the cause they support , they're to see how rampant their ' chain letter ' of sorts can go . I find them very annoying . If I know it's truly to support a cause , I will do it ..... otherwise , keep your chain to yourself . 
Noooooo ! I'm an Aries now ! But thankfully I'm on the cusp so to me I'll always be a Taurus ! 
\I'm sorry your new astrological sign has rendered your tattoo meaningless . \"" 
Just got word that my nephew is about to be born . My brother's girlfriend's water broke . 
You know it's cold outside when ..... 
I'm sorry but I did not order the snow . Could you please take it back ? 
Wow . Weather.com actually says it will be \bitterly cold\ " tonight . You know it's bitterly cold when the weather professionals use the term ! Anyone want to send a bunch of space heaters and electric blankets my way ? ;-) " 
Movie trailers that don't even hint at what the movies about truly annoy me . Makes it really difficult to pick a movie on Netflix sometimes ! 
I'm looking to expand my portfolio of restored photos . If you have any images that need to be restored , doesn't matter how old or what needs corrected , let me know ! I hope to do photo restoration as a side job at some point and just need to give potential clients an example . I would restore your photo at no cost . 
\Attention K-Mart shoppers . There are Jews in aisle 12 . \"" 
Ya know .... I really don't get people who are into the whole organic thing . It's been shown that it's not healthier nor is it better for the environment .... so what exactly is so great about going organic ? 
Well I got the beginnings of my website to promote my photo restoration business venture together . As soon as the server finishes setting it up , I'll be uploading the information . I'll be sure to share the web address later . 
Well my website is still a work in progress but here's the link :\ 
http://www.picture-restore.com/ 
I think Green Bay cheated by giving their players steroids . Did I watch the game ? No . Do I know anything at all about football ? I know what a QB is . What's my basis for my accusation ? The Bears lost and I just have a hunch . ;-) 
So my roommate is trying to create a new recipe and is sauteeing some veggies . When I asked him what he was going to do with the eggplant he responded , \Cooking it . \ " Smart ass . " 
So I've decided I'm not crazy about my website in it's current form . I'm now working on something different . 
I think I'll give Joomla a try for the content management of my site . Wonder how it'll turn out ....... 
So why do people still talk in third person here on facebook ? Don't they realize their post isn't directly to the right of their name anymore ? Time to get with the times ! 
My nephew , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Smith III , was just born . Another child to add to my other neices and nephews . I'll be sure to share pics as soon as I get some . 
Is it just me or does Miley < PROPMALE > have the speaking voice of a stereotypical lesbian ? 
It would seem our country has become the Iced States of < PROPFEMALE > ! 
It would seem everyone has snow on the brains . Let's choose a different topic and leave the snow where it belongs .... outside ! 
I didn't realize that Tron : Legacy was out in theaters now . Should I brave the weather and go see it ? hmmmm 
Is it just me or is facebook chat different today ? 
Advantage #1 of owning a large dog : They double as a wonderful pillow ! 
I made stuffed onions for dinner . Yummy ! 
I just watched the first episode of \Roseanne . \ " They sure don't make sitcoms the way they used to ! " 
So I've come across a funny image with 32 \mature people truths\ " on it . I'll be sharing items from it for the next few days possibly . I hope ya'll enjoy . My next post after this will be a mature person truth . " 
Mature Person Truth #4 :\ 
There is great need for a sarcasm font . \ 
Mature Person Truth #27 :\ 
Shirts get dirty . Underwear gets dirty . Pants ? Pants never get dirty , and you can wear them forever . 
So I just finished watching \Prince of Persia : The Sands of Time\ " for the second time . I first saw this movie in the theater without having played the game . I played the game after watching it . This time watching I was expecting to see certain scenes and turns out they weren't there . I guess I'm getting scenes from the movie and game confused ! " 
So I've watched a few Disney Channel movies on Netflix . Is it just me or do they begin each movie the exact same ? High school in background , overacting , talk of the future .... check ! 
Just heard an interesting quote ..... \Anger is just fear pointed inwards . \"" 
Glee did Rent . Wow ! Was really good . Wonder what the next 20 minutes of Glee has in store . 
There were some amazing musical arrangements on Glee tonight ! 
Forecast says it's gonna be almost 60 degrees outside . Where's my shorts ? ;-) 
So I'm looking at recipes for bread and I think I found an awful typo \1 and 112 teaspoons salt . \ " That's a lot of salt for wheat bread ! " 
\I'm going to < PROPFEMALE > myself ... just as soon as I'm sober . \"" 
Racism is a social cancer that destroys societies from within . It is a social injustice that betrays the very foundation of humanity . It can only be destroyed by education , experience and stepping out of your comfort zone . From the very beginning God created man in His image , to exclude or demean anyone EVER based on a meer genetic expression or geographic origin is a betrayal to God first and then humanity . 
\Never < PROPFEMALE > a werewolf . \"" 
\I just want to put him in my purse like a < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > chihuahua ! \"" 
Rewatching the awesome show that is \Kyle XY . \ " Shame on ABC Family for cancelling this show and replacing it with a show about a pregnant teenager ! " 
I've read that a lot of Republicans are condemning Obama's decision to stop defending DOMA saying he's trying to take people's focus off the economy . Have they given a thought past their own bias and realized that legalizing gay marriage would help the economy ? 
You know you've had too much chili when you pass gas and it smells like chili . 
\C'mon! Be a whore for a friend ! \"" 
Truths for Mature People :\ 
#24 - I have a hard time decyphering the fine line between boredom and hunger . \ 
#32 - Even under ideal conditions people have trouble locating their car keys in a pocket , finding their cell phone , and Pinning the Tail on the Donkey - but I'd bet my *** everyone can find and push the snooze button from 3 feet away , in about 1.7 seconds , eyes closed , first time , every time ! 
\Don't postpone joy . \"" 
I think my jaw is stuck open . While on imdb looking up the voice actors for the new Thundercats movie I saw a new Thundercats SERIES for this year ! Thunder , thunder , thunder , thundercats ! Hooooooooo ! 
The Neverending Story was such a great movie . Why don't they make movies like this anymore ? 
Anyone know what the gender neutral term for a host/hostess is ? I know generally things go toward the masculine form of a word , but I see a lot of job listings looking for a hostess as opposed to a host . Makes one think they're discriminating based on sex ! 
I just tried to look at the pics on my sister's ex's facebook < PROPFEMALE > . Apparently my computer doesn't care much for him either . 
I'm thinkin of starting one of those \chain\ " status messages . You know the type that you copy and paste as your own if you're for or against something . But what should I make ..... hmmmmmm " 
I put a coat on today to take my dog out only to find it wasn't needed at all ! Finally some weather that truly feels like spring ! 
Beannachtaí na Féile Pádraig oraibh ! 
Am I the only one who is scared of < PROPFEMALE > Obama's eyebrows ? 
I find it stupid when people say \good morning\ " at midnight . It's called midnight for a reason .... it's the middle ... not the end ..... of the night . AM does not denote morning . “AM” stands for the Latin phrase Ante Meridiem —which means “before noon”—and “PM” stands for Post Meridiem : “after noon . ” " 
Rest in peace < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > . May the < PROPFEMALE > rivers of heaven bathe you in their wonder . 
Do you ever wish life was like a videogame where you can simply reload back to a point before you totally fu**ed up ? And no , I didn't fu ** anything up . I just thought about it as I was saving my game . :-p 
I just discovered that the guy who plays Finn on Glee ( < PROPFIRST > Monteith ) was born exactly one day before me .... May 11 , 1982 . Too funny ! 
The majority of the \Local Favorites\ " on Netflix deal with WWE and the like . Should I be concerned ? lol " 
Just got a call for an interview tomorrow . Sure hope I get the job ! 
Movie quote of the day : \You look like half a butt puppet ! \"" 
Made skillet chicken paella and tostones for dinner . Yum ! 
Wow ! The wind sure is strong out there . If you own a < PROPFEMALE > dog .... don't take it outside ! It might end up in a tree or worse .... in the land of Oz !
