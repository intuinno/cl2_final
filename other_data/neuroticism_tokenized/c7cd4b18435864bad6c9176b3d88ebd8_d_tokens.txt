I need a good book - suggestions ? 

On our way to Casa < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Is the Furminator really worth it ? 
Just made my special chocolate Halloween cupcakes - Devil's food with Buttercream frosting - remembering good times in the Dash 
Pitman Halloween Parade , this Saturday from 3-4 p.m. Trick or Treating to follow :) Black Spider Man and Snow White ( aka Aidan and < PROPFEMALE > ) will be there . 
Aidan and < PROPFEMALE > had a great Halloween - their favorite part is giving out < PROPFEMALE > to their \customers\ " who they literally drag off the sidewalk ( did I mention we ran out of < PROPFEMALE > in approximately an hour . " 
After reading about certain voting mishaps today ( a friend's daughter hit the vote button before she was done voting ) I chose to vote without the assistance of my children . :) < PROPFIRST > , however , did take Aidan and < PROPFEMALE > to vote and they wrote in < PROPFIRST > Fothergill for Pitman Borough Council . Guess you have to move to NJ < PROPMALE > . 
So ... I wholeheartedly believe in giving Thanksgiving its due ( i.e. no Christmas prep until AFTER Turkey Day ) ... that being said , is it wrong that I want to go tag my Christmas tree this weekend ? 
Going on a much needed and much overdue date night with my wonderful husband ! 
Tagged the tree and put a big dent in Christmas shopping . Let the festivities begin . ( It is now time for the erring of grievances . ) 
I am pleased to announce that I am now a Partner with Barker , < PROPFIRST > & Gelfand , P.C. now known as Barker , < PROPFIRST > , Gelfand & < PROPFIRST > :) 
Happy 5th Birthday Aidan ! 
LOVE my new printer , which makes finding a letter \S\ " picture for Aidan to take into preschool a 5 instead of 50 minute project :) " 
May the road rise up to meet you . \ 
May the wind always be at your back . \ 
May the sun shine warm upon your face , \ 
and rains fall soft upon your fields . \ 
And until we meet again , \ 
May God hold you in the palm of His hand . \ 
\ 
Happy St. < PROPFIRST>'s Day !
