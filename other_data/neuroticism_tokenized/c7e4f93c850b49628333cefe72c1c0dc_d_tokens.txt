Just bought some more incenses and a dock for them , too . OMFG , they're amazing !!! <3 
Got a bit of a headache :P 
Its about time to open my mouth to speak . I need a new voice , outlook and way of life . I am much too small and too meek , you see . I have no passion , motivation or drive . I've lost my love and loves and more . I've lost the battle and I'm losing the war . I can't control my emotional state , so I hide away for my emotion's sake . Heartache , distance and cabin fever . Regrets , mistakes and simple-minded teasers . <3 
Kinda restless and anxious . Can't be still and stuff . That's normal , I guess . I hate these walls that surround me . Where to go , where to go . This room , that room ? Fuck it , anywheres better than inside . Got too much time to think to myself , my thoughts butcher me so . <3 
I have nothing to hide , people . <3 XOXO <3 
<3 I love to sing-a , about the moon-a and the june-a and the spring-a . I love to sing-a <3 Lol , Looney Toons :D

Oh my Ghandi , look at the snow <3 
Ooooooooh , the excitment !!! <3 Holidays are weird :) 
Is there such a thing as an alpha+female ??? <3 
Feeling a little nostalgic lately . Missing early mornings and open highways and being honest and all that jazz . Kinda miss being free and innocent <3<3<3 
Slowly starting to pull my head out of my a ** , lol ! I feel so stupid most of the time , but it doesn't mean I really am . Time to start thinking with my heart and stop giving in to what is just and comfortable . Work hard and live free <3<3<3 
I want some tea , please ... :P 
Lonely and bored out of my mind . Feels like I'll never leave this place ... 
Job huntin ' , baby !!!! <3 Yea , this is goin ' no where ...

Men don't show emotion , except rage , because it takes strength to show soft emotions . Most men don't have that kind of strength . They keep things inside . Then they kill someone . - < PROPFIRST > Carlin <3 
There's a moment coming . It's not here yet . It's still on the way . It's in the future . It hasn't arrived . Here it comes ... sh*t ! It's gone . - < PROPFIRST > Carlin <3

Had a nice little walk today . Bored now , I get so disappointed when I get home sometimes lol . Need someone to < PROPFEMALE > out with for a c < PROPFEMALE > e , tired of the drama <3<3<3 
Can't sleep , like usual . Bored-d-d-duh ! <3<3<3 
Wanna express myself without soundin ' too dramatic . Pretty hard , because I am dramatic . Can't blame others for not understanding , ' cause I don't get it myself . When are things gonna look up ? <3<3<3 
Blah , boredom :( 
Why does everyone think I got it good just ' cause I'm home all the time ? My misery is nothing but a joke and I'm the only one not laughin ' . 
The caged bird's song has no worth if no one's around to hear it <3<3<3 Rip off my wings and chain my feet , I'll never fly again ... 
Why ? Why ?? WHY IS IT SNOWING AGAIN ??? 
Sssssh !!!

Finally , I say something sweet and genuine and IT'S ACTUALLY HEARD AND CONSIDERED !!!! I luv my Mommy <3<3<3

This place has become a beautiful prison and walls are closing in on me . I'm the one holding the key to my cell yet I'm to afraid to use it . Who is so foolish that they fear their own freedom ? <3<3<3 
I love when I finally get to lay down in my bed to relax , just to hear my dog lick his nuts for an hour and a half ..... Blah <3<3<3

Had fun today , I miss those days where I can sit around and act like an idiot <3<3<3 
I miss having friends that would call me when they miss me or because they wanna < PROPFEMALE > out , not because they're pissed off and wanna fill me in on the latest bullshit . I'm sorry , I did care but now I don't . Keep it to yourself . 
I just got left here , boo hoo :( 
Too few and far apart <3<3<3 
Why do I suddenly feel like the filth at the bottom of the barrel ? I guess there's no escaping the fact that I will always hurt . And now I'm alone , great ........

Who wants to runaway to New York with me ?!? <3<3<3

Quietly waiting for daybreak ... \ 
It really sucks when you're the only person in the house CAN'T sleep ... 
I never thought something like this would make me cry . I would never go outta my way to disrespect anyone . This is beyond ridiculous and I ' d never try to hurt you . The fact that this has happened several times already is really mind-boggling to me . I'm sorry if you felt disrespected but this completely ruined my weekend . And after everything is said and done , if anyone should be upset , it should be us ..... 
Chivalry isn't dead . All these so called \good men\ " no one can seem to find don't want whiny girls with painfully high standards ... Just sayin ' :D "

Droppin ' off the face of the Earth , goin ' to the < PROPFEMALE > ... <3<3<3

Hibernation time <3<3<3 ......... 
I think its time for a new identity !!! I'm gaining a confidence I didn't know existed , I've just been struck with inspiration or something <3<3<3 \ 
I think its time for a change ... First it'll be subtle , then it'll huge !!! I just don't know what it is yet ... 
Heating up a bowl of Mommy's friggin ' awesome fabulous super yummy scrumptious soup !!! <3<3<3 Oh yea , and it's really good btw :3

You know the worst part about having a really great day ? Remembering that you are a freak-of-nature that never sleeps and you get on FB and stare at a blank screen at 3:30 am because you ain't got sh ! t else to do and nobody else is awake ... 
This computer has no cushion ... \ 
I can't feel my a$$ ...
