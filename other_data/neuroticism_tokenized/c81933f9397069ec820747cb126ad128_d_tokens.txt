Is quitting smoking again . It's going to forever this time . My throat is so sore from smoking a boat load over this weekend . It didn't help that it's legal to smoke in the bars in Wisconson . 

I think I am going to start recording family guy . I never got into it until now . 
Is about to head out for a drink or 2 if < PROPMALE > ever gets here ! 
Working and exhausted . 
Just about ready to leave , it was a slow and peaceful night at work . 
@ work again . 
Paintball tomorrow , CPX , Joliet ? 
Happy New Year to all , I hope this new year brings you everything you want . 
I'm around a 10.5 !!! 
Insanity workout , is freakin rough !!!!! Ouch ouch ouch !!! 
< PROPFIRST > Chelios just stopped into our store , sweet . Nooo , I didn't ask for an autograph . Although , he seemed like a very calm and passive guy . 
I love having great friends !! Thank you to all that helped yesterday , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , Let , < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > ( thanks for watching the doggie ) , even little < PROPFEMALE > helped . Everyone had a part , even < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > kept each other busy . I just didn't think that you ladies were going to do all that yesterday , but you ladies were of great help to < PROPFEMALE > and I . THANKS A MILLION ....... 
Oh and I forgot to thank my Mom and my family for helping so much with putting the baby shower together . Thanks ! Love ya Mom , Dad , < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFEMALE > . Even < PROPFEMALE > was helping at the baby shower , Thanks < PROPFEMALE > Love you too ! 
It's after 2am , do you know where your kids are ? Mine and < PROPFEMALE>'s may be home soon .. Little < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > looks like he may want to get out soon . 
Just waiting in the triage room , little < PROPMALE > does want to come out . Man , I'm sleepy , but gotta stay awake to let < PROPFEMALE > squeeze the hell out off my hand . No baby yet . 
Wow my cousins were right baby < PROPFEMALE > will be coming on my Aunt < PROPFEMALE>'s bday . Happy birthday . So it looks like we'll be parents sometime today . 
Oops that should have been Aunt < PROPFEMALE > . Sorry :( 
< PROPFEMALE > and I want thank everyone for your kind words . < PROPFEMALE > is passed out and they have our son and checking his vitals . Almost time for the first bath . 
I can't decide what to do , does anyone know about water softeners ? We just got an estimate from rain soft , they said $3800 for a whole home carbon filtration ( this goes on before the softener ) , and the softener . The kicker is they want to give us 5 years worth of their cleaners , a $3000 value he said . This would come with a lifetime warranty , and they can move it to another house if we move , that would be 500 though . 
Yay , @ Blackberry farms with or son and godson . Trains , trains , trains . :-) 
For all those who asked me about EVO's , we still haven't received stock since I have been back to work . I will try to update you individually as they come . Don't worry I know who's waiting . 
Awe thanks everyone for the birthday wishes . I haven't really been on here , so today is the first day I checked it in awhile . 
Google 
Man the day needs to be longer ...... 
Happy holidays from the < PROPMALE>'s!!!!!! 
Let it snow , let it snow , let it snowwww ....... 
Just put < PROPMALE > down for a nap after reading some stories to him . This boy needs his naps , otherwise he is cranky with dear ol ' dad . 
I hate difficult ass teachers that take their job way too serious ! Never once was I graded so hard on papers that I have written . Its like she's nit picking the smallest things . All my life I have been commended on my papers and only now someone says I'm doing it all wrong , grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr . I can't wait to finish this freakin class .. 
Just thinking about where life has taken me .. 
So anxious today , must be the Monster Absolute Zero I'm drinking .
