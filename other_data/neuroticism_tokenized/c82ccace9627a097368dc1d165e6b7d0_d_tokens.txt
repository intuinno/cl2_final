Well , now I want Monday to hurry up and get here . I'm tired of break , and I miss my friends . If anyone wishes to < PROPFEMALE > out , just ask . I have no other plans , after all . 

So , I just found my old Facebook account . I made it about 2-3 months ago , but then I forgot about it . xD 
There's a giant blank space on my wall now , and I need a filler for it . :( 
Studying to get my permit for the next week or so . I hope I can get this shit over with on the first try . 
Going to get my shit from < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE>'s later today . Hopefully staying over there next weekend . 
[ Weird Dream #36 ] - \Holy fucking shit ! An Oboe !!! \"" 
The average person feels lonely 48 days of the year . 
My surge in friends is making it hard to use the live feed instead of the news feed . 
Holy shit , I have an actual photo up on Facebook . How odd . 
Right , well today didn't go anywhere near what was planned . 
<.< It better fucking snow tomorrow . I'm serious , if the high is going to be 38 with winds of up to 30 mph , then school does not need to be open . 
Well ... I'm fucked . I have tomorrow to finish my two < PROPMALE > projects and write all my notes for Tuesday's end of course exam in PhySci . 
Oh noes ! Mom is home ! I've had an awesome day , dammit , I hope she doesn't ruin it . 
I'm currently addicted to < PROPMALE > Graffin . The man is talented as hell . 
Raggle Mo'Fuckin ' Fraggle ! :( I miss ' The Grim Adventures of < PROPFIRST > & < PROPFEMALE>' . 
Holy fucking fuck , it's 16 minutes until Giftmas ! 
Giftmas is here ! What did you get ? I got $100 & < PROPFEMALE > . :P 
Gave myself a nice free gift . FrostWire ! lol :D 
Just receieved an additional $170 when I went up to Grandmother's . < PROPFIRST > decided to double his usual amount because of the hard times . :) 
I wish today would go ahead and end . I got what I wanted out of it , now it should go away . <.< 
Damn good day . Though , I spent way too much money . I came back with $50.75 out of $270 . xD Then again , I was generous with my giving today , plus I bought 5 Dawkins books , so I don't mind having spent that as much as I usually would have . :) 
Just finished the 1st chapter of ' The Greatest Show on Earth : The Evidence for Evolution ' by < PROPFIRST > Dawkins . I want to read more , but I'm tired . Hopefully I won't have too much to do tomorrow so I can squeeze out the 2nd & 3rd chapters , as well . 
Watcing movies and reading my book all day . Most likely staying with the Keevers tomorrow . 
My New Year's resolution is to not make a resolution so my year isn't wasted striving for some goal instead of just living for the moment . 
Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog . 
Free Palestine from the Zionist Oppression ! Peace in the Middle East is achieved through sanctioning < PROPMALE > ! 
<.< 2 hour delay ? For what ? I want to go to fucking school ! 
No fucking school tomorrow either ! This is bullshit ! 
So ya , I've once again been sucked into adding another social networking site . So , if you want to ask me anything that you can imagine , than I'll answer it as long as I deem it worthy of an answer : http://www.formspring.me/pestisab 
So .... I have nothing to do . Uhh ..... here's a link ? : http://www.formspring.me/pestisab 
\First Blood\ " & \ " Rambo : First Blood Part II\ " - Great movies . " 
I is teh bored . Hopefully going to < PROPFEMALE > out with some friends later . 
Woot ! Looks like we're going to be in school tomorrow ! Everyone keep our fingers crossed . :D 
Oh , Pokèmon music ! How I love thee ! If only the Pokèmon series was still good . :( 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ON THE COLBERT REPORT TONIGHT !!!!! ZOMG ZOMG ZOMG !!!!! 
Why did I wake up so early ? 
I iz making a pizza ! :O 
\I like blasting my music . It aint Rock'n'Roll if you can't feel it . \ " - Dad " 
Former 5-term Tennessee Representative from the 9th Congressional District , < PROPFIRST > Ford Jr , is speculated to be running for the NY Senate in 2010 against < PROPFEMALE > Gilibrand , who was nominated to replace < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > !! I endorse this man for Senate , if that means anything to you . lol 
Yay , we finally get to go back to school ! Fuck you break , don't ever come back [ .... until a couple of weeks from now] !!! 
Going to watch some Castle , then House , then take a shower , and then I'm off to bed for the night . School tomorrow . :D 
Today was kickass , in my opinion . 1st period with < PROPFEMALE > , met this cool chick in 2nd period who is also a huge Dawkins fan , Lunch is meh , 3rd with hilarious people . However , 4th I'm the only one who seems to know anything about the class , because it's filled with dumbass jocks . <.< 
Holy shit , I just had a 4 minute phone conversation with my dad ! That's a new record ! xD 
Even though she can't see it , I would just like to dedicate a special , \Fuck you ! \ " to Nesha for getting me addicted to \ " Fireflies\ " by Owl City . DX " 
I really have to get this AP US History work done . <.< 
I've accomplished a lot today . I finished watching the videos I was suggested , and I finished all my school work . I feel very happy about that . :D 
I'm in a < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > mood today , which means I'll be in a Slipknot/Stone Sour mood for the rest of the week as I obsess over this man . xD 
Fuck you CJ ! I'm now obsessed with Boxxy ! DX I can't help it though . She's so jittery and cute !! xD 
Just sitting here , waiting for < PROPFEMALE > to get back from Mock Trial . Hopefully the rest of today will go better . 
<.< Dammit , my throat is starting to get raspy , phlegmy , and raspy again . 
Ugh , stomach pains , sore throat , and phlegm out of every oraphus [ hyperbole] !! I hope I'm not sick in the morning , school is actually entertaining these days . DX 
Thinking of volunteering at Kingsway Charities in Bristol , VA . It's a Christian organization , but you can volunteer even if you're not . It's dedicated to supplying and shipping medical supplies to developing nations in need , such as Haiti . However , I can't get there without a help of a friend , so if anyone is interested , we'll talk about it at school tomorrow . 
So , I've been looking into tuition and fees at the University of Washington . Estimated T&Fs for residents ( individuals who have had an established domicile for primarily non-educational purposes in the state of Washington for up to a year ) is $ 20,445 . Estimated T&Fs for non-residents is $ 37,120 . What the fuck is that ? 
So , either my right nostril is a whore , or it's larger than my left . O.o 
Dear mother of Raptor Jesus ! I accidentally added a spammer app . If you get a notification about me commenting on your photo , or something along those lines , don't pay attention to it . 
The fuck ? I posted something on someone's wall , and it showed up on my wall . o.O 
I is teh bored . :/ 
Dear Baby Jesus , Please help my sister < PROPFEMALE > not to throw up all over my face and my nice , new , church-going shoes . It would be greatly appreciated . Your eternal servant , Zac P.S. ESPECIALLY not on the nice , new , church-going shoes . 
Going to watch DBZ Abridged by Team Four < PROPFEMALE > for the 5,000 th time . :D 
So , I need to do my Chemistry homework and finish my review of \The < PROPFEMALE > Letter\ " for AP US History . :/ " 
I'm not going to finish this Chemistry work . DX 
Gave up on the Chemistry Homework , I'll just do it over the weekend for reduced credit . I can't rush to finish any longer , because I'm not even half done and I've already been doing it for over 2 hours . <.< 
Apocalyptica and < PROPMALE > Potter and the Half-Blood < PROPMALE > to keep me entertained today . Yay ? :/ Let's hope the power doesn't go out . <.< 
I've become so accustomed to this cold that I just walked outside in the snow , barefoot with a shortsleeve shirt on , and stood there for nearly 5 minutes without shivering once . 
Wow , I actually almost cried when Dumbledore died . :( 
Oh , < PROPFEMALE > Manson , you're so awesome ! Compelling music , great sound , and an overall intelligent man . Anyway , now that I've said that , let's get to writing this AP US History movie review . 
I've decided to procrastinate on the movie review just a bit longer , and now I will resume watching DBZ Abridged . :D 
I is teh bored . First person that IMs me will get freebies . What kind of freebies ? Who cares ! They're freebies ! 
Completed my English II Essay . Now it's time to procrastinate the completion of my AP US History Key Terms until I'm finished with my celebratory popcorn snack . :D 
Zac needs discussion . Therefore , you should IM Zac and give him such a thing . :D 
Pandora is failing pretty hard tonight . I've liked two songs it has suggested , out of 7 , in the past 20 minutes . I'm about to run out of songs for this hour ! <.< 
<.< That's the 5th fucking time that I've fallen for the < PROPMALE > Roll site that avoids your mouse when you try to exit out of it . 
Sometimes , I get really pissed about the requirements for essays . They seem pointless at times , and obvious at others . Because of that , I'm usually persuaded not to do the assignment . This time is not an exception to that . <.< 
School's out again . Trying to convince Dad to stay home from work so he can take me over to Tavie's at 1 or 2-ish . 
I think I'm getting sick . Damn you , < PROPFEMALE > ( or Tavie ; haven't decided who yet) !! DX 
Ya , I take that back , I'm pretty sure it was Tavie that got me sick , not < PROPFEMALE > . I'm feeling way too shitty for this just to be the common cold . 
My mom keeps talking about how it would be better if we stayed in the old house , because it would have supposedly saved us money on our bills . Apparently she doesn't understand that without insulation , the cost to heat your house sky rockets . Also , she doesn't take into account all the plumbing issues we would have had to fix at that shithole , either . 
My stomach feels like it's going to explode ! DX 
I'ma head to bed now . 14 hours of sleep drains you quite a lot , for some odd reason . 
I've slept 26 out of the past 48 hours . Being sick sucks balls . 
For some reason , I taste popcorn . O.o I haven't had popcorn since Sunday at Tavie's . 
4 trees down at my house , power's gone out once , and I have to go outside later to help Dad drag one tree out of the road . 
If god is omnipotent , than why can't he fail ? And if he can fail , than what can't he do ? Either way , there is no way to be omnipotent . 
Am I the only one who's only tuning in to the Super Bowl for that dumb fucking < PROPMALE > Tebow ad ? I just want to see how horrible it is , I don't give two shits about the sport . 
If we're out again tomorrow , than I severely hope I'll be capable of brokering some time to < PROPFEMALE > out with friends . 
Hey everyone , guess who just broke his glasses in half !! >.< I can't see for shit , so I had to move my monitor less than a foot away from my face , and it's still blurry as hell . 
The other day I was told by my Landlady that hoping will not do me any good , and that prayer will . What's the difference ? Both are frivolous , just one assumes the existence of a deity . 
Thank fuck for LensCrafters !! I get my glasses today . :D 
You never really appreciate the ability to see until you're visionless . After a full day with my shitty-ass natural vision , I finally have science on my side to aid me once more . :D 
One day I hope to look up UCHS and see all the dreams my friends have accomplished . I see a lot of potential in some of you all . Artists , Politicians , Musicians , etc . I expect a large list of famous alumini from this nowhere-town's high school . :) 
lolz I love < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > . He's a liberal , progressive Atheist , and his father is the hero of all the bible-thumping conservatives . He is so opposite of his father , it's not even funny . 
By the way , I just found out it's < PROPMALE > Day ! Happy < PROPMALE > Day everyone ! :D 
You never know how much fun you can have at the expense of a horny virgin on the internet until your friend takes a screen capture of him trying to solicit cyber sex . xD 
Better do this homework , just in case we do have school . :/ 
Going to < PROPFIRST>'s for a while . Having plans 3 days in a row is odd . O.o 
Well , fuck . I have to move . Not out of the county , but just out of my house . Still , I don't want to , I like it where I'm at . :( Eh , maybe I'll move somewhere a little closer to friends . 
<.< God dammit , I have 43 minutes to do an essay that I had no prior knowledge of . 
I'm losing circulation in my hands [ I think my parents forgot to pay the heating bill ] , I can barely type , and I have an essay due in 10 minutes ; which I have only half-way completed . DX 
Is anyone else incapable of fathoming that people of power do everyday , ordain tasks , such as shitting and pissing , or waking up with morning wood ? Just imagine , the Pope shits on a daily basis ! :O 
Wow , the second Taliban commander in less than a week was detained today . 
When I run for political office , I can call my political action committee \Zachary < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE>'s Political Action Committee \"; aka \ " ZAC-PAC\ " . Take that SarahPAC !! xD " 
I should really start studying to get my permit . I've only got 41 more days before I can get it and still get my license on my birthday !! ...... Now that I think about it , I've got another week or so to wait before I have to start studying . 
I didn't get any sleep last night , yet I'm not tired . o.O 
No school on Friday or Saturday . They're going to wind up simply taking away Spring Break . I hope you all know this . 
I hate how my mom treats my older brother like he's still a baby . We're being kicked out of the house , we have to find a place to live in , and she can't face the reality that we can't afford a place that can hold him too anymore . He's 21 , it's time for him to get a house of his own , anyway . 
I just sat on the phone for 20 minutes and convinced my cousin that I was baked . I feel proud of my acting abilities . xP 
Okay , seriously ? The crazy bitch who shot her fellow faculty members at the University of Alabama says she can't remember killing , and now she's going to plead insanity . She won't go to jail for the atrocities she's committed . She'll simply be locked away in an asylum for 20 or so years , and then be set free to the world once more . 
\You know what they should have called that book ? < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Poe- ms. ... ha ha . \ " - My brother . " 
o.O Why have I only done the first paragraph of a 7 paragrah essay in 4 hours ?! Gah , I hate that I can get so easily distracted when my brother comes over . 
I just realized that everyone around me is now in a relationship . <.< I feel lonely . 
Argh !! English II essay !! 
Wait a second here , what ?! Am I reading this correctly ??? < PROPFIRST > BECK acknowledges that GLOBAL WARMING is fact ?! You mean that this man actually has a sensible perspective on something ? Wow . 
<.< The Last of the Mohicans was a shit film . I can't believe I just wasted 117 minutes on that . 
Ugh , I'm bored .... and I don't feel like doing homework . I reeeeaaally hope that we get out tomorrow so that I have an extra day . 
Lithium & Iron : The Meaning of LiFe . 
Xenon & Sodium : The Warrior < PROPFEMALE > (: P I love using chemical symbols to spell out words . ) 
I is going to watch Archer at my brother's house for a while . I'll be back after a while , I guess . 
Random Fact of the Day : If your father had gotten off just one microsecond sooner , you would be an entirely different individual , or you might not have even survived birth . 
Holy shit , I actually got the DBQ done . :O 
<.< My mom is really annoying when she talks to my cat : 1 . ) She treats it like it can and will respond ( yes , I do this , but I don't EXPECT a response ); 2 . ) Her accent thickens when she talks to < PROPFEMALE > ; 3 . ) She yells for no fucking reason . 
Next on my netflix queue : First two discs of Season 1 of \The West Wing\ " and \ " 9 \"." 
Woot ! My edit on < PROPMALE > Newsom's wikipedia article has gone unchanged for over a week now . I feel accomplished . :D 
\Minds are like parachutes . They only function when they are open . \ " - Sir < PROPFIRST > Dewar " 
Why try to disprove that which has not been proven ? 
I just found a huge stack of papers stuffed under my keyboard . I had completely forgot about them . xD 
If I have an IQ of 127 ( which is what I had whenever I took the IQ test at age 11 ) , then what range does that place me in ? I know the average IQ was 100 for many years , so I know I'm above average , but where exactly do I \place \"?" 
If someone could help me with some of the questions I have about scheduling classes for next year , that would be nice . 
I've finally scheduled my classes !! Woot ! :D 
Great , this stupid acne cream that mom bought me has made things worse . <.< 
I just had a 30 minute conversation with my cousin , explaining to him why it would be harmful to the entire fucking world if we were to drop enough hydrogen bombs in order to wipe the following nations entirely off the map : Iraq , Pakistan , Kuwait , and every other one which has ties to the Taliban . <.< Fucking imbecile . 
I'm going to finally watch \9\ " . :D " 
Click \like\ " if I've ever made you smile in your life . Make this your status and see how many people you have made smile . (: " 
Just got a phone call from 388-5397 . I'm horrible with cell phone < PROPFIRST > ..... so was this any one of you ? 
xD The Dalai Lama has a twitter now . 
Okay , I'm done obsessing over the Dalai Lama's twitter account , now I am pissed . Some dumbass conservative from NC is trying to get < PROPFEMALE > ( the man who put us in the worst recession ever seen since the Great Depression , until < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > fixed it and Dubya broke it again ; who also started the War on Drugs , aka the biggest waste project known to American history ) on the $50 < PROPMALE > . 
< PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland was good . However , I forgot to copy down what questions to do for my Chemistry homework , so I now have to turn it in for a late grade on Monday . :/ I'm doing so badly on keeping up with my shit in Bolt's class ; I feel like I'm letting him down . 
Holy shit , holy shit , holy shit !! T-Pain and I share a birthday !! :D 
Going to nerd it up in the political spectrum , bitches ! Time for the entire first season of \The West Wing\ " !! xD " 
Cinnamon Toast Waffles & The West Wing . Best start of the day in quite a while . 
Woah , woah .... wait ..... when did this \V\ " get on the Periodic Table ?! " 
Today has been one of those rare kind of days , where nothing goes wrong and all is well . I'm relaxed and I don't have anything to do , and I'm okay with that . :) 
Weeeeell , the court just took all of the money my mom had in the bank due to overdue hospital bills , and we got the news that we will , for sure , be out of this house within 6-9 weeks . :/ 
Just waiting for my facial cream to dry before I go to bed . xD I'm such an effiminate man . 
<.< I just love going to my myspace account and seeing people posting pictures of how much money they have , while I'm about to be kicked out of my house . 
Talent Show was awesome . < PROPMALE > & < PROPMALE>'s band were the best act , of course , but I enjoyed how my group of friends made fun of the boring acts . lol 
I can't finish my book by tonight . I know that I can write a report about it , because I've already garnered enough knowledge about evolution to talk about it , but I wanted to finish the entire thing by tomorrow . :( 
I fucking hate gloomy weather ! I are teh depressed . DX 
is at Tavie's house . 
I'm glad these one day weekends are over . I'm going to be tired as hell tomorrow . 
I'm in a Nirvana mood . Oh how I can't wait to live in the city of Cobain . 
My mom wants us to move back to our old house in < PROPFEMALE > Hill , the one without insulation , proper plumbing , or properly sealed windows . Who's willing to adopt me if they move there ? ( I'm serious , too , I'm not moving back there . ) 
Fuck , I don't own anything other than black anymore . <.< If I get pinched tomorrow , I'm going to kick a bitch . 
Haha , I slipped on my < PROPMALE > Zombie shirt today , thinking , \I better not get fucking pinched for not wearing green . \ " I look down during the announcements and realize that there are green-fleshed zombies on my shirt . :D " 
Going to watch the final disk of Season 1 of The West Wing , then start up on Season 2 . Going to get a pizza from Lil Caesar's soon , as well . 
Fucking West Wing . I'm way too emotionally invested in this shit . xD 
I didn't actually expect The Little < PROPMALE > to be this awesome , but it's now one of my favorite books . o.O 
I suppose I'll finish \The Little Prince\ " and try to finish season 2 of \ " The West Wing\ " today . Don't suppose I have much other to do . " 
:/ I'm bored , and I hate this gloomy weather . I just feel like sleeping so that this will all go away . 
I guess I should get to work on my AP terms . I'm certain that I won't get yet another free-pass tomorrow . I mean , it's not like I have my movie review , so why piss her off ever further by telling her that I don't have the terms either ? 
Shit , I even told myself and everyone on Facebook that I was going to do the terms , and yet I still didn't do them . Hopefully I won't get bitched out too much . <.< 
xD Holy shit , that was the best moment in all of cinema : Guy challenges zombie , zombie punches him in the face so hard that he goes flying back 4 or 5 feet . lolzzz 
Zombie punches dude and sends him catapulting backward 4-5 feet , dude bites the fucking zombie and beats it over the head with its helmet , new zombie comes and he disposes of it easily , previous zombie reawakens and tackles dude over < PROPMALE > , dude uses dead zombie's intestines as a rope to climb back up the < PROPMALE > . EPIC . MOVIE ! lmao 
Wow , I just talked to a really close friend for the first time in 5 or 6 months . Apparently the only thing that's holding him together in life is the fact that he has a loving girlfriend who he couldn't see himself living without , and it made me realize that the only thing tearing my life apart is that I don't have the same . :/ 
I may , possibly , have found a house ! :D Unfortunate part , however : I would be living near a mini-trailer park of severe rednecks . One of them actually has not one , but TWO Rebel Flags hanging on their porch . <.< 
I need something to do today ..... but what ? :/ 
I should probably finish my rough draft for my English report .... but I have until Tuesday to complete it . Hmm ..... I guess it won't hurt to put it off until tomorrow . 
Atheist/Humanist/Secularist Quote for the Day : \Reason is that by which we live . \ " - Myself ; Normal Status Update : I HAVE A FUCKING RESEARCH PAPER DUE TOMORROW !! WHY AM I ON FUCKING FACEBOOK ?!?!?! DX DX DX " 
Went to take a piss , almost fell asleep . Thanks NyQuil , I almost face-planted into my toilet because of you . <.< 
Oh , youtube , why must you change on me ! I don't love you quite as much as I once did , now . :( 
I need something to do or someone to < PROPFEMALE > out with . <.< 
Today's been pretty cool , so I think I will top it off with some < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , Ensiferum , and The West Wing later tonight . 
Well great , Tennessee didn't have a fairly liberal Democratic governor as it was , but he was better than our extreme-right Republicans . Now that < PROPFIRST > McMillan has dropped out of the race to pursue the mayoralty in Clarksville , the only Democrat left is a former governor's son with no political experience . I guess I'm glad that I'm moving to Seattle in 2012 . <.< 
Wow ..... Obama's Energy Plan seems to be a carbon-copy of < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE>'s Energy Plan from her faux Presidential run in 2008 , which she \launched\ " as a response to McCain calling her an elitist celebrity in an ad which compared Barack Obama to her and other elitist celebrities . " 
I don't understand the social trend of self-degradation and degradation of one's peers . Why is it that everyone is someone else's \bitch\ " or \ " hoe ? \ " And what the hell is it that attracts you to calling eachother \ " nigga\ " or \ " n****r ? \"" 
I forgot to do a daily atheist/humanist/secularist quote of the day for yesterday ! D: Now to give myself brain damage by headbanging to Ensiferum ...... for punishment purposes , of course . 
Oh well , I'll just give a random ass quote and give another sometime later tonight : \Isn't it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to believe that there are fairies at the bottom of it too ? \ " - < PROPMALE > Adams " 
Happy Zombie Jesus Day , everyone !! May your brains be safe and your eggs be colored and hidden . :) 
Why is it that when I have the whole weekend to write an essay , I'm an absolute shit writer , but when I have less than 24 hours ? Oh , look at that , literary masterpiece . ( Just a sidenote : I don't really think that this is a literary masterpiece . I simply used the term to portray my point that I'm awesome at writing at the last minute . ) 
I really need a new profile picture . I do not feel that my current , short-haired photo portrays me correctly anymore . I represents a time of transition , and now that the transition is over , I feel like I should show the current me . In short : someone snap a photo of me when I'm not looking and not acting retarded , that way I won't flinch or tense up or anything , as I do in pictures . :P 
Oh , System of a Down , how I wish I could make love to your music . lol 
Fuck you < PROPFEMALE > Magnus , you made me become interested in American Idol for the first time since < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > in the 3rd season . Though , I can't stay mad , you're vocal are awesome as hell . 
< PROPFEMALE > Bachmann : The < PROPFIRST > McCarthy of Our Generation . An extremely conservative and paranoid member of Congress from a fairly liberal state . Luckily she doesn't have quite as much influence as McCarthy ever did and is recognized by most as fucking insane . 
The argument of how god is beyond our feeble comprehension has always struck me as odd . If god is too complex to comprehend , than how are we capable of comprehending that he is anything more than what we understand as is ? As well , why is it that people can claim to know what god considers a sin , or the punishment individuals will recieve for those various sins , if we are not able to understand him/her/it ? 
<.< Dammit , SNL , why do you endorse < PROPFIRST > Bieber's career ?!?! He looks 12 , yet he sings about nothing other than love . Fucking grow some hair on your nuts and then come back to us with your songs about love ; then maybe I'll take you more seriously . 
Oh , goodie , a single piece of Pita bread for \dinner . \ " The wait until lunch tomorrow is going to be unbearable . <.<" 
Last night's meal : One slice of Pita bread . Tonight's meal : 2 pieces of grilled , seasoned chicken breast , green beans , and peanut butter cookies for dessert . I is a happy boy . ^_^ 
Fuck , Fuck , Fuck , Fuck , Fuckity Fuck Fuck Fuck !! I don't give two fucking shits about anything right now . Fuck , that's not fucking true , I'm just trying to fucking prove a point to one of my fucking friends . Why ? Don't fucking know why , but I fucking like it . 
xD Some kid who was allowing his dog to shit in our yard just tapped his chest and thrusted it outward , like some sort of gangster-wannabe dumbass . Oh , how I love this town . Where the religious rednecks are secretly \gangsta\ " when they need to be . How I'm going to miss this stupidity when I move . x''D " 
\I hope you trip and punch yourself in the balls . \ " - < PROPMALE > Zeller ( xD ) " 
So , I have officially added a new name to my \if-I-were-gay\ " list : < PROPMALE > Grohl . xD " 
I forgot about the National Day of Silence tomorrow and made plans to < PROPFEMALE > out with Tavie again . :/ I guess I'll just go through the school day without speaking , instead of the entire day as I had originally intended . 
I feel like running for Student Body Council . I honestly don't know why , considering that I know I wouldn't win ( I'm just not popular enough for that , and that's all these things are : popularity contests ) , but what do any of you think ? 
Chemistry Homework & Rise Against // After I get this through with , I'm going to watch last week's Daily Show episodes and then work on completing Season 3 of \The West Wing . \ " Such a great way to end this epic week . " 
The Men Who Stare at Goats !! :D 
Ninja Warrior ! Hell yes , I haven't watched this show since Sasuke 21 ( I think it was ) , but now they're on to 24 . Really brings me back to the olden days ...... in 2008 . xD 
I want to see if I can go < PROPFEMALE > out with my friend < PROPFIRST > this week , but I keep forgetting to write down his number , so I'm going to have to wait until he calls me back again . xD 
Today marks the 15th anniversary of the Oklahoma City Bombing , orchestrated and carried out by < PROPFIRST > McVeigh . However , another little less known event happened on this day as well . 228 years ago today , in 1882 , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , the infamous postulator of the Theory of Evolution , died of a heart attack . His last words were , \I am not the least afraid to die . \"" 
I should really discipline myself to not go into each new day optimistically , that way when all goes for shit I won't feel let down and depressed . Yay life . <.< 
I'm feeling better now . Not a depressed little emo bitch anymore . :D Yay Life !! 
I wish my name was Kunta Kinte . :( I would get pretty pissed if someone called me < PROPFIRST > instead of that epic name , as well . Gah , that would suck . 
Everyone I know is going to prom ( except for Caelie ) . It feels so odd to be one of the very few , lone hold-outs . 
Oh ! What a twist ! < PROPFIRST > is back within the first 2 minutes of the new episode of House . Let's keep watching to see how this folds out . 
I really hope not to lose a friend over this . I don't seem to be as numb to the realization that I may lose someone this time . :/ 
If complexity indicates design , than who/what designed god ? He/she/it is said to be more complex than we humans are capable of fathoming , so why doesn't his/her/its complexity automatically point to an ultimate designer , as well ? 
Making peanut butter cookies . Like only a real man does . 
My dream band consists of < PROPMALE > McIlrath of Rise Against ( Vocals ) , Teemu Mäntysaari of Imperanon/Wintersun ( Lead Guitarist ) , Shavo Odadjian of System of a Down ( Bassist ) , and < PROPFIRST > Jordison of Slipknot ( Percussionist ) , with < PROPMALE > Graffin of Bad Religion stepping in to help < PROPMALE > write lyrics from time to time . I know some of their sounds and styles don't match entirely , but in my head I could make them work . lol 
Going to get my permit tomorrow , which means that I'll be at Dad's work all day with nothing to do but sit on Facebook until I go take the test . :/ Hopefully I'll pass it the first time . People said that I don't need to study , so I haven't . lol 
xD I'm doing really shitty on this permit pre-test . 
As you do not know the path of the wind , or how the body is formed in a mother's womb , so you cannot understand the work of God , the Maker of all things .  - Ecclesiastes 11:5 ; There you have it , folks , by god's very own word , god is not too complex for humans to understand . haha // Cramming in a few things before I head out to get my permit today . 
I was turned away at the Elizabethton DMV because I didn't have a school form as my second evidence of my address . I had a letter from a college that I got in the mail yesterday , but since it wasn't an acceptance letter and merely solicitation , they wouldn't take it . Now I have to wait until just before school or just after on Monday to get my permit . <.< 
I'm going to < PROPFIRST>'s for the weekend . Talk to you all on Sunday . :D 
Sitting in < PROPFIRST>'s living room on his phone . This is really harder to type with than I thought it would be . lol 
I don't have any of my homework completed , but I had a good weekend , so fuck it . I'll just make it up for a late grade , I suppose . 
If any of you get a notification from some BFF Quiz thing , do NOT click it . It's a spam-trap . 
Going to watch Law Abiding Citizen before I finish up with my AP project . 
Law Abiding Citizen was an epic movie , if I do say so myself . Now time to finish up these case reports . :D 
is dissappointed that more people aren't joining/liking my organization/page Students and Parents Against No Child Left Behind ( SPA - NCLB ) . :( 
I got 14 signatures on my petition to run for Male Vice President of the UCHS Student Council today . If I was allowed to get signatures from people that aren't in my grade than I would already have the 50 required and more , but whatever ; I can still get the signatures in time . 
Grease was great tonight . Bravo to all members of the Drama cast . // In other news : I have almost all the signatures needed to be on the ballot for Male Vice President ! :D 
I have the signatures required to run , except for one teacher signature , which I'm going to get from Mrs. Tucker on Monday . :D < PROPFEMALE>'s already said she'll make me ( at least ) a campaign poster with her < PROPMALE > expertise . 
Today .... holy hell . It started off perfect , but it slowly and quickly went downhill from there . Dad's pissed at me , I'm tired from walking the majority of the way home , and my knee is beginning to act up again . Hopefully tomorrow will go over a whole lot smoother . 
Grape Drink , how I love thee , but you leave such an unsatisfying aftertaste in my mouth . :( 
I'm feeling a huge Rise Against mood coming on . Brain , be prepared to digest \Hero of War\ " many times over before the end of this day as I browse through various songs of theirs . " 
It is unbearably hot in my house right now . DX I want a fan !! 
If heat rises , and heaven is up , than why is hell the place of ultimate heat ? 
DEPRESSION is not a sign of weakness it is a sign that you have been trying to be strong for too long . Put this as your status if you know someone who has or has had depression . Will you do it and leave it on your status for at least an hour ? It's Mental Health Week and 1 in 3 of us will suffer at some point in our lives ! 
Atheism is the only -ism that isn't actually and -ism . You never hear someone call themselves an a-fairyist or an a-unicornist . They are just stated as non-believers in fairies and unicorns . 
I want to light the friend zone ablaze and burn it to the ground ! 
Just accidentally cussed out Mrs. K . DX 
I don't want to take that damn English EOC tomorrow . <.< It's going to be easy , but that's the bad part . It's of no challenge ; it's too simplistic and boring . 
Had to shower . No underwear in the drawer . Dryer ? Nope . Is the clean-clothes basket still in the living room ? Nuh-uh . Must be in Mom and Dad's room . Wait ... where are Mom and Dad ? <.< Oh , they're fucking again . I'm soooo happy they decided not to divorce ** ULTRA-MEGA-SUPERDUPER-FUCKING-SARCASM !! D:< D:< D:< ** 
I started yelling in an obnoxious voice , narrating the path of my chicken < PROPFEMALE>'s final hours before it's untimely demise in the bowls of my stomach , and then my mom came in my room and yelled at me because the repair man was outside and he could hear me . xD Epic . 
So , opinion poll : To shave or not to shave ? \ 
\ 
I want my beard to grow out , and grow out faster , and the only way to ensure that is if I shave it to speed up the process of regrowing hair . On the other hand , I'm lazy . IT'S UP TO YOU TO DECIDE !! :D 
Fucked up my knee yet again today . I was playing Tag-hide-and-go-seek . Ran across the yard with no problems at a fairly good speed , and then I stepped onto base and landed on it the wrong way . I got on base just as the kid was tagging me , so I was safe , but at what cost ? D: Going to get a new knee brace tomorrow . 
Well , I suppose I'm going to get ready to get my new knee brace . I'm so very joyous that my knee has decided to be a little bitch and let out on me . <.< 
I finally have a new knee brace now . It has adjustable metal hinges to keep my leg strong ! :D 
< PROPFIRST > Moore , you are by far the best director to ever grace the film industry ; especially when it comes to documentaries . His newest (\Capitalism : A Love Story \") is magnificent and compelling . " 
The only truths in life are as follows : You live , you must pay taxes , you die , and bears don't like it when you cradle them like a baby and sing them a lullaby in the tune of A minor . If you learn those four < PROPMALE > truths , than life will come easily . 
Walked from the school , to CHIPS , and back home this afternoon . When the cool air hit me when I got home , it felt so fucking awesome . lol 
Bowling for Columbine just came in ! :D I'm going to watch the new episode of Castle , and then get to work on it . Hopefully I can finish it all tonight . 
has to write a book report in class tomorrow , but didn't read a book , so instead is going to write an essay about his disdain for mandatory reading and why he thinks reading should be for fun , and not enforced from a regulatory list of \teen fiction\ " novels . :D I'm such a little hellion . :P " 
Everything is so much more hilarious when you say it in the voice of Emperor Palpatine/Darth Sidious . :P 
Everyone should be leaving the prom within the next hour or so . I hope it passes rather quickly ; I want to < PROPFEMALE > out with my friends ! D: 
Just finished Taken again . Tonight didn't exactly go as I had planned/hoped , but as long as my friends had fun , than I suppose that I have no right to complain . :/ I guess I'm going to bed now . 
R.I.P. < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Dio\ 
You will never be forgotten . :( 
Today is the International Day Against Homophobia . It is celebrated on the anniversary of the declassification of homosexuality as a mental illness by the World Health Organization , ran by the United Nations . Please , join me in celebrating this monumental day , and take a stand against homophobia !! :D 
When we give instructions rather than ask questions , we kill that which allows us to grow as human beings : curiosity . 
Oh , Ten Masked Men . You're the best cover band ever ! :D 
That was the saddest season finale I've ever seen . :( Poor Beckett . \ 
( Fuck , it's times like these when I become emotionally invested in the love lives of the characters on Castle that I wonder how the hell I had enough testosterone in the womb to form into a male . lol ) 
Facebook , I really hate you at times . I know I posted a response to a comment on my last note , both of which now no longer show up for me . <.< 
Going to stop by Pizza Plus to give good ole Jennee a visit before heading off to graduation . :D 
Well , graduation went well , I suppose . At least I was manly enough to hold back my tears until the walk back home when no one was capable of seeing me shed them . xP\ 
To all graduates : I love and am going to miss you all . :) // :( 
I almost didn't have internet for a week this morning because my modem died . I was about to go insane from the lack of connectivity to the outside world , but then Dad found the old modem . :D 
Dad and Mom have both said they think the cat ran away , so either < PROPFEMALE > the Cat , Empress of < PROPFEMALE > truly did run away , or one of these heathens ran her over and now the other is helping to cover their tracks . <.< 
Headbanging to classical music . :D 
SHUT THE FUCK UP , BIRDS ! IT'S 12 FUCKING 10 !!! GO TO BED !!! AGGGHHH !!! D:< 
Well , my plans for the weekend have all been cancelled . :/\ 
By the way , Happy < PROPMALE > Milk Day ! :D 
My dad is blasting AC/DC in his headphones , and it's so loud that I can audibly hear each word as if he were listening with speakers . xD 
Just walked from Tavie's to Food City ( roughly 5-6 < PROPMALE > , but I'm not the best judge of those sorts of things ) because I was pissed , then I called my dad , waited for 30 minutes before calling him back , and got no answer . Waited another 30 minutes , called him , and he got pissed because he had expected me to sit outside of Food City the entire time . Then I got bitched at for the entire ride home . 
Spending the day listening to < PROPFIRST > Lajoie and trying to figure out what to do for the rest of the week . 
Today marks the beginning of sister's week ! If you have a sister that you would do anything for as they would for you , copy and paste this into your status . [ I don't have a blood-relation or legally-recognized sister , but I have a sister who I would do anything for nonetheless . ^_^ ] 
< PROPFIRST > Gray ( #2 ; Slipknot's Bassists ) was found dead this morning in his hotel room in central Iowa . He was 38 years old . :( 
Last day tomorrow , then going camping Wednesday , and then hopefully I'll have plans for Friday and Saturday . :D 
Dad won't let me take a towel to school today for Towel Day . :( I'm sorry < PROPMALE > Adams ; I've failed you . I suppose I won't know where my towel is today . DX 
Camping tomorrow , with Tavie and others on Thursday , not sure about Friday yet , and then hanging out with < PROPFEMALE > all day Saturday . It's going to be a busy week , but it's definitely going to be worth it . (: 
< PROPFEMALE > , correction : Camping tomorrow , no plans Thursday because of a load of bullshit , not sure about Friday , and then hanging out with < PROPFEMALE > all day Saturday . Still a good week nonetheless . 
I should probably go finish my yard work before I have to get ready to leave . 
Home from camping . Twas epic , as I knew that camping with hippies inevitably would be . :P At < PROPFEMALE>'s now , going to the Talent Show thing soon , and then I'll finally be headed home . 
I'm now officially Harbinger-423's #1 Fan and Chief Roadie . I suggested the root word which formed their band's name , I've been to every one of their shows , and I'm going to begin helping to pack up after each show ( as I did at their last show ) . I feel so fucking special ! ^_^ 
should probably shower sometime soon . I smell like fire still . lol Not that I hate that smell ; in fact , I love it . 
' SiCKO ' is one of the greatest documentaries ever made . I know that I say that about every < PROPFIRST > Moore film , but this was my favorite over all ; hands down . That definitely saying something considering how big of a fan of < PROPFIRST > Moore I am . 
I don't like waking up so early . Especially not on a Sunday . There's never anything to do . <.< Luckily , I'm going to be hanging out with some friends pretty soon . :D 
is trying to catch up on The West Wing . I'm on Season 3 of 7 ; Dad's on Season 6 . I'm waaaay behind . haha 
I just postulated the alternate outcome of the 2004 elections had < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > been nominated over < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > at the Democratic National Convention , taking into account the few swing states that went to Bush because < PROPFIRST > seemed indecisive and/or too conservative . // I need help . xD 
I want to change my name to Blashta Kolaballah and conquer a nation so I can rename it Bleshtakoleev , that way I can be Prime Minister Blashta Kolaballah of Bleshtakoleev . :D 
I fucking hate rednecks . I really , really do . No one cares if your goddamn car's engine makes a lot of noise !! If you're so insecure , go buy a penis pump or some viagra ; it's a whole lot cheaper , asshole . 
If you like this status , I will post on your wall something I like about you . Make this as your status if you want a challenge . 
Too many distractions from The West Wing ! xD I'm never going to find out if it's going to come back to bite < PROPFIRST > in the ass for snapping at the President at this pace . :P Though , all of these interruptions have brought much joy . 
If it were asked of me to pick love or cash , there is no doubt that I would pick love any day . Cash can be squandered away on any material object that will be useless in less time than it can be put to use . Love always has a use , and if you're wise than it is capable of outlasting even your physical being . 
Today has been great . :) Thanks to those that made it so ( you know who you are ) , but now I'm going back to my dark corner of The West Wing before I take a shower . :P 
A person like myself has no one to care for him , but everyone to care for . 
I just tried to go to a web < PROPFEMALE > and this message came up : \This is not the < PROPFEMALE > you are looking for . \ " \ 
Off to watch The West Wing . If anyone needs anything or just wants to talk , message me or whatever and I'll divert my attention for whatever it is that you need . 
I can't stop listening to Gnarls Barkley's \Crazy . \ " xD " 
Note to self : Chicken begins to taste like plastic if left in freezer for too long . Blech . 
Just finished Season 3 of The West Wing . Twas a sad way to end the season . :( 
I can't get my mind off of you , and I certainly don't want to . (: 
I can't count how many times I've stopped to see if I'm just dreaming . Thus far all signs point to this as reality . (: 
* Sigh * Kill me . Kill me now . Why did I have to add this little annoying bitch on Myspace ! DX She won't quit IMing me even though I've never shown signs of being her friend at all !! UGH ! 
It was the only parasol on the whole of the island , so we heard . We didn't ask after all the black umbrellas we saw , let alone the question : what was the difference between those black umbrellas and a parasol ? And not because we cared if we looked dumb , but because if you went too far with a question like that one , it could turn a rare thing into a commonplace thing . 
Watching South Park . ^_^ 
So , I've deduced that metabolism has finally kicked in for me . Since Thanksgiving 2009 , I've been 188lbs , not gained a pound nor lost a pound ( well , actually I was 192 when I weighed myself on Thanksgiving , but I had just eaten , so that accounts for 4lbs easily . xD ) . It feels rather odd . o.O 
A little birdy just committed suicide by repeatedly ramming into the window next to my desk . o.O 
Death metal and Politics seem to go hand in hand for me . :P 
I really wish I could convince myself that you're ready , but it's obvious that you're not . My feelings aren't going to fade , but I'm not sure if it's time yet . 
I need to take a shower , but I can't garner the motivation to do anything right now . Ah well , I suppose I'll just sit here in my filth , read the latest news , and listen to music . 
\I'm gonna name you .... Jesus .... < PROPMALE > .... Jesus - and that's from the Bible . \"" 
Just got back from Geocaching . Actually wasn't all that bad . Plus , you know , I got to eat and fuck around with a lightsaber for a few minutes . :P 
Not going to sleep ; fuck that shit . Instead , I'm just going to stay up all day and crash around 10 pm later day . Only bad part : what to do until then ? o.O 
Fuck you , Google ! Just let me open Rockabilia !! I want my Slipknot mask !! DX 
I thought I could make it through the day , but I can't . I'll just set my alarm for 12 so I'll still go to sleep pretty early later tonight . 
My fucking mom turned off my alarm clock before it could wake me up . <.< 
AAAAAAAAAAHHHH !!! TWO WEEKS UNTIL NEW FUTURAMA EPISODES !!!! :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D 
Fuck yoooous , Intarnetz !!! D:< Lemme get on teh Tumblr !!!!!!!! Raggle-fucking-fraggle !! 
* Sigh * I wish I were black . I've never seen a black guy that wasn't capable of pulling off any hat he so damn wished to pull off . :( 
I hate one-hit wonder bands . Especially when you don't realize that they are one-hit wonders and the first song you listen to is their one hit . You get your hopes up that you have just found a new epic band , and then ? Disappointment . 
ATTENTION : I WILL BE COMPLETELY HONEST FOR 24 HOURS ! \ 
You can ask me any question(s ) you want , no matter how crazy , sinister , wrong , or even really rude they may be ! I WILL answer no matter what . However , they must be sent to my inbox . You have my FULL honesty , but I DARE you to put this as your status & see what questions you get asked . 
This day needs to end before I go insane . Fuck all of this shit . 
All I know , is the wine last longer when you don't gotta share with some-one ! All I know , is the steak taste better when I take my steak-taste-better pill ! 
I've been blocking the entire world out for the majority of the day and it feels fantastic ! I'ma go back to watching my YouTube series now . I still have 9 parts ( each running about 10 minutes ) to watch before I can move on to Thursday's episode of The Daily Show with < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . 
Fuck The Daily Show , I'm already tired for some reason . Only got to Part 76 . :/ Oh well , I got all day tomorrow . 
Holy shit , I'm lucky to have a balding dad . If I hadn't had to clean his hair out of the drain before I got in the shower just now , I would have stepped in the shower with the biggest fucking spider I've seen in nearly 5 years . 
bought the coolest fucking notebook of his life the other day , but can't figure out what to put in it . :/ 
Now that I've finished that 80 part YouTube series , I suppose it's time to start on this 68 part YouTube series . :D 
I'm feeling extreeeeeeemely lazy today . I can barely sit up in my chair in order to type this status . 
I should probably take a shower soon . :/ 
Fuck white bread ! In fact , fuck white anything . D:< Fucking honkies ruining my damn day ! NOTHING WHITE CAN DO ANYTHING RIGHT !! 
Sitting at Tavie's . o.O Wondering when the hell I'm going home . 
Back from Tavie's . Going to either < PROPFEMALE > out with JenShep or < PROPFEMALE > ( depending on JenShep's plans ) tomorrow , and then I might also be going to Harbinger's band practice on Wednesday . ^_^ I'm going to write a song for them and see what < PROPMALE > thinks about it . :D 
Oh , Norther . You had me at , \AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH !!!!!!! \"" 
My monitor just died and now I'm using my dad's computer for a bit . :/ This sucks < PROPMALE > balls , because this means that I have to go back to my old clunky fucker that refuses to die . DX 
* Sigh * Is now officially using his clunky-fucker monitor . :/ I can't wait until Dad buys a bigger version of his so he can give me the smaller one . 
The writing is coming along nicely . Whether it sounds like it can be made into a song is another question entirely , but even if it can't then I'm still coming up with a pretty great poem right now . haha 
Grrrrreat , I have to cancel my plans now so that I can stay home and do yard work . <.< Fuck today . 
Really ?! I had to cancel my fucking plans for THAT ?! There were only two little patches of grass that I even needed to mow , and I cut about a half an inch from each of them !! I didn't even mow 1/12th of my goddamn lawn !! <.< nmlfdanklgdhajlgnfmda , lhjil 
You know , a girl that's comfortable enough to talk about all things sexual without getting uncomfortable is cool and all , but there's a certain period where you draw the line . Like , oh I don't know , once you become a mother . Eugh , I don't want to hear about that shit . 
D: I lost my Monster !! Think Zac .... think !! Where did you have it last ?! 
You can now like individual posts ?! This brings a whole new realm of possibilities . xD 
Going to go to sleep . I'm sleeeeeepy . o.O 
Well , that 7 hours should allow me to stay awake until about 12 or 1 tomorrow , then my sleeping schedule will officially be back to normal . :D 
Woo for split second power outages !! xD 
Who's the douche rooting for North Korea to win the World Cup because he's fed up with the world's shit ? That's right , it's me . 
I really hope < PROPMALE > Greene wins the US Senate Election in South < PROPFEMALE > . xD 
Hrm .... I'm thirsty ... but I'm too lazy to make a new pitcher of orange juice and clean the chocolate milk out of my cup just to pour a single glass of juice . :/ I'll just wait for Mom to get home and then make her do it . 
I want to watch a movie . Or do something . Anything really . That would be nice . * sigh * 
I'm feeling rather alone at the moment . * sigh * I hate these rare bouts with depression . :/ 
Oh , DBZ Abridged ; how I love thee . The thought of Goku training to \Cooking by the Book\ " off of LazyTown is just so great . " 
ATTN AIRMAN WHITE SUPPORTERS - TRY TO BE AT GRACE FELLOWSHIP CHURCH OFF GREENWOOD DR . IN < PROPMALE > ON MON @ 4 . THAT IS WHEN THE FAMILY STARTS RECEIVING FRIENDS . PLAN ON STAYING UNTIL WESTBORO IS GONE ! THIS WILL BE A TIME OF PEACE & FELLOWSHIP , NOT OF VIOLENCE ! PASS IT ON ! 
I find that I'm actually more comfortable acting in ways that I'm not than in the ways that I am . I love acting female , < PROPFEMALE > n ( as in , an inhabitant of < PROPFEMALE > ) , Black , British , etc ., but when it comes to acting like the American White male that I am , I just seem to be so awkward . 
New monitor !! YAAAAAY !!! :D I <3<3 new monitor . I'ma name it < PROPFEMALE > . :) 
Counter-protesting the Westboro Baptist Church tomorrow . It's sad that these are the circumstances on which we have to do this upon , but we counter-protest not just to state our denial of their appalling sense of reality , but also to honor Airman White's memory . 
I can not express how much it still pisses me off to see someone flying a Confederate Flag . Especially if it's RIGHT NEXT to a fucking American flag ! <.< Do these dumbass rednecks not understand that the Union and Confederate troops fought AGAINST each other ?! It's a total contradiction to fly both ! 
Happy Summer Solstice / Atheist Solidarity Day / WBC Counter-protest Day ! :D 
Grrrreat , my mom threw away the fucking hairdryer without telling me about it . Now my head is going to be soaking wet for 2 hours or so . 
French Reporter : \What satisfaction do you get out of smashing guitars ? \ " \ 
I just really need a cigarette right now . <.< I don't even care if I quit anymore ; fuck life . 
Just so you all know : The Collector . Great . Fucking . Movie . Epic is more suiting , actually . The ending is slightly disappointing , but oh well ; can't always end how I wanted it to , I suppose . 
Just think : in 2 days it will be the one year anniversary of < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE>'s death , and just 3 days after that ( 5 days from now ) it will be one year since < PROPFIRST > Mays died . :( Tragic . 
You have no idea how much I hope this is finally it . When you pulled into that driveway to look at the house for rent , I was ecstatic . If you go through with this , it will be the first good thing you've done for this family in a long time . 
Well , I guess there's one good thing that happened with the drama of today : I didn't have to mow or clean out my dad's car ! :D 
My new hairdryer is beastly . :D 
\I haven't done anything wrong in this relationship . \ " - If that isn't the biggest lie I've ever heard 
I'm really glad that people don't talk to me very often , because I accidentally left my Facebook on when I left today . xD 8 hours and not a single IM . :P 
It's been one year since < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE>'s death . :( I'm going to go listen to a non-stop marathon of his music now . 
Someone must take a recording of my voice . I need to know if I sound Southern . o.O I hate getting all paranoid when I see some of my friends on video who sound extremely southern . 
BEFORE THE DAY ENDS , I MUST HONOR < PROPFIRST > MAYS WITH ONE SCREAMING STATUS TO COMMEMORATE HIS LIFE ON THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF HIS DEATH !! WE ALL MISS BEING SCREAMED AT BY YA , < PROPFIRST > ! IF I BELIEVED IN A HIGHER POWER , I WOULD DEFINITELY SAY YOU'RE IN A BETTER PLACE RIGHT NOW !!! 
NOOOOOO !!!! : '' ( < PROPFEMALE > Fox just got married . DX 
\YES ! YES ! I DID IT !! I AM THE BIGGEST HERO EVER ! I BEAT UP A GIRL !! \ " - Caboose " 
I really hope that I have a job in the future that will allow me to design and build my own house , because otherwise I'm never going to be truly happy anywhere I live . 
tavie fucking rules . by the way , you forgot to sign out on my ipod , zerk . 
Oh yay , I'm probably going to get bitched at when I get home because my dad forgot that I told him I was staying the night at < PROPMALE>'s last night . <.< 
< PROPMALE > Harris : \Fucking cat litter . \ " \ 
* Sigh * Am I the only < PROPFEMALE > n who really doesn't care about Independence Day ? I mean , ya , blowing shit up is cool , but how about doing it on the actual day that < PROPFEMALE > was granted their independence from the United Kingdom rather than the day that a few < PROPMALE > white people came together and said , \Ya ... we're sick of your shit . \"" 
Renowned Atheist/Secularist author < PROPMALE > Hitchens announced on Wednesday , June 30th , that he has been diagnosed with throat cancer . Though I may not agree with him on multiple things , he stills seems like a rather decent and interesting fellow when he's not in debate mode , so I'm hoping that he pulls through this . Modern Science don't fail us now ! 
Had a fun time watching Char getting scared for her life by Sasquatch in a clown mask . xD 
Fuck yes , Halloween II just came in the mail from Netflix ! :D 
I have to say , Arch Enemy is probably one of the best live performance bands ever , and that's saying something considering that they're a death metal band . < PROPFEMALE > Gossow is the < PROPFEMALE > of Death Growling . 
By wearing an upside-down cross , Satanists are unwittingly showing humility and unworthiness before Christ . That makes about as much sense as a neo-Nazi sticking it to the Jews by swearing off pork for life .  - 8 Historic Symbols That Mean The Opposite Of What You Think by : < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > on Cracked.com 
While I absolutely love < PROPMALE > Zombie's take on the Halloween series , I do rather hate how he defecated all over the character of Dr. Loomis . He was nothing like the egotistical , money-grubbing asshole he is depicted as in the new movies , or at least in the second movie . I seem to remember him being more sympathetic and compassionate in the first movie . 
I'm in a fucking crazy mood today ! I don't understand half of what I'm doing , and in order to think this status out I've had to make random ass noises that probably make me sound insane . xD 
My beautiful sound system is dying on me . :( I'm going to cry when it finally goes kaput . 
Fuck you random , generic Myspace band sending friend requests at random ! I don't care about your band ! I'll check out your music and more than likely enjoy all of it , but fuck you for intruding on my musical tastes ! D:< 
I feel like my room is missing something very important , so I'm either going to buy a Buddha statuette or a Buddha incense burner for atop my dresser as soon as I get the money . :P 
The short fillm/music video for the song \Snuff\ " is so sad . :( My little Slipknot fanboy heart just can't take it . " 
I spite thee by way of rather harsh words and a complete lack of respect for thine belongings ! ( Translation : Fuck yo ' couch ! ) 
Si Si Puedewich ! 
I can't quit talking in a voice similar to the stereotypical , muscled badass from action movies . The bass-toned voice which is always awkwardly loud , but always hoarse ? Also , I keep making up sad little scenarios in which a struggling actor with such a voice wants nothing more than to be a romantic comedy < PROPFEMALE > , but can not because of the limitations his voice puts on him . ( I think I'm going insane . ) 
Must wake up extremely fucking early tomorrow to go to Gatlinburg , but I'm not complaining because it's going to be great . ^_^ 
What ? Zac's jumped on the bandwagon and listed his middle name on Facebook too ?! \ 
What a travesty ! But it's okay , because I'm being a rebel and keeping\ 
Zac as my first name rather than the full \Zachary\ " . :D " 
Nothing to do , I have . Any one to < PROPFEMALE > out with , I have not . 
I'm going to watch two of my favorite Vash walk-through series over again : Batman Arkham Asylum [ 39 Parts ; average length of each part : 10 minutes ] and Mirror's Edge [ 19 Parts ; average length also being 10 minutes ] . But first I'm going to at least make it halfway through Season 5 of The West Wing . 
This last part of Season 4 of The West Wing is just too much . VP Hoynes's resignation over an affair , Zooey Bartlet's kidnapping ( with an epic soundtrack in the background ) , and now the season finale . What is in store for this episode ?! 
Went to see Eclipse with Jennee , AJ , Blackid ( I like spelling it that way more , plus I forgot his name because everyone was saying that instead . xD ) , and that one kid that doesn't really talk . \ 
Funniest . Movie . Ever . Holy shit it was so fucking horrible . 
Haha ! Fuck you , Apple ! Experts expect a total recall of the iPhone 4 very soon . Just admit defeat to the might of Droid already . Google beat you at smartphones , just like Microsoft beat you at PCs . You suck as a company . Either drop AT&T altogether or move up the release date for your Verizon iPhone , otherwise you're going to be fucked before January . 
Fourty-one minute long AmazingAtheist video ?! Today is awesome already . :D 
If you like this status I'll tell you what I like , dislike , my first impression of you , and a confession . [ I enjoy these things , don't judge me . ] 
YEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSS !!!!!! FUCK YES !! BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD ARE COMING BACK ON AIR !!! HOLY FUCKING SHIT , YES !!!!!!!!! ^_^ 
I'm very much in love with my modified shirt from < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > and the hat < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE >/< PROPFIRST > ann/Leigh < PROPFEMALE > \gave\ " me . :P " 
All of the sudden it's hot as hell in my house . D: 
< PROPFIRST > Gambon , who plays Dumbledore in the < PROPMALE > Potter movies , looks rather odd without the beard and long hair . o.O 
I do believe that my head is going to explode and liquids of all sorts are to be coming from my every orifice within the next few days or so . Sickness ..... woo ? 
Why do I have a Christian inspirational song stuck in my head right now ? xD 
I wish to travel to < PROPFEMALE > and find myself a maintenance man . Hot Asian chicks and Kung Fu championships , here I come ! 
Going to watch the original Karate Kid and maybe Karate Kid 2 on Netflix . Great way to spend my sick days . :D 
Plural form of octopus : octopuses ( or ) octopi ( or ) octopodes . [ The more you know , eh ? ] 
I feel like picking up the Trombone again , remembering how to read that damned sheet music , and then joining a ska band . xP 
In my sickly state I forgot that the next day comes at midnight instead of after you go to sleep . I could have sworn today was the 20th and I was about to get ready to go get my schedule for next year . >.< 
If you're brave enough , copy this to your status and see what people rate you : ( 1 ) crazy ( 2 ) fun ( 3 ) talkative ( 4 ) sarcastic ( 5 ) lovable ( 6 ) sexy ( 7 ) strong ( 8 ) dumb ( 9 ) spoiled ( 10 ) creative ( 11 ) wild ( 12 ) wanna kiss you ( 13 ) funny ( 14 ) lets go out ( 15 ) beautiful ( 16 ) amazing ( 17 ) cute ( 18 ) a good friend . [ Meh , as < PROPMALE > said , \What the hell ; why not ? \"]" 
I'm really , really considering taking up the Trombone again once I get the money to buy a new one . Well , a used one , but you get what I mean . The last one I bought was about a thousand dollars used , so it will be a while before I get one . [ I spam Facebook a lot when I'm sick ; I just noticed . ] 
Oh yay , the drainage process has begun . <.< Now my nose is going to be perpetually leaking for the next couple of days and every time I cough there will be mucus . >.< At least it means that I'm starting to get over this sickness . 
I'm hearing a high-pitched squealing noise . o.O 
If I had enough energy I would just stay up until 8 tomorrow , go get my schedule and fix it , come back home and go to sleep after . Buuut , I don't have that energy , so it looks like I'm going to sleep early yet again tonight and waking up early yet again tomorrow . 
Got my schedule now . Switched from French I to Infotech , but it's the 1st period of the day . >.< That is going to suck on Homeroom days . 
What ? ZAC is evolving ! \ 
Congratulations ! Your ZAC evolved into SKAZAC ! ( Pronounced : Ska-zik ) 
Why are guys forced to cut their hair when they get a job in the food industry , but women aren't ? Hair is hair , people ; if I don't want to cut it then I can wear a hairnet just like a woman is allowed to . It's not like male hair can bypass the net any more effectively than female hair .

I need to get out of this house , but I also have to read 2 books in two weeks and write journal entries on them . >.< Damn you , procrastination ! 
Ghosts I - IV is amazing . < PROPMALE > Reznor , you are a god , sir . I especially like 29 . Rather chilling , and the first time I've ever heard someone play a fucking banjo and make it sound chilling/depressing/creepy . 
Today . It was awesome ! :D < PROPMALE > out over at Tavie's house with < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , and < PROPMALE > . Went to the mall , Books-a-million , Wal-Mart , and all those other fun places . Oh ya , and Starbucks , but only < PROPFIRST > got anything and I only got two sips from it , so that doesn't count . But I did get to lightsaber duel with < PROPMALE > as Sith Jesus . haha 
FUCK YES !!! Found my Gameboy Color and it still had Pokèmon : Yellow in it !!! Playing this shit all fucking day now . :D :D :D :D :D :D 
Today is just an awesome day for me . I found yet another old treasure of mine : my old peace green , recycled cotton Peace shirt that I bought Earth Day 2009 . ^_^ 
Holy shit . < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , you look fucking epic with a beard , sir . Please never shave it off . :D 
If I were President , my first act in office would be to tweet the following : \Would it be perceived as unpresidential of me if I ended this ' tweet ' with a toungey-face ? :P \"" 
I just found my old pair of church pants that I haven't worn since I was 11 . They used to be so tight on me that I could barely breath trying to button them . Now they slip right off my waste when I try to put them on . o.O What was I fucking eating 5 years ago ?! 
Had to delete my last status in favor of this one : I want to name my son Balthazar Oberon < PROPMALE > so very , very badly ! 
Arrrr-kansas : The Kansas for Pirates . 
o.O Blood on the Dancefloor scares me . How can anyone find this shit entertaining or lyrically/rhythmically pleasing in any way ? 
I should try to finish The West Wing soon . I'm only on Season 5 . :( 
We must not be afraid to pursue truth , no matter where it might lead us . 
Remember kids : It's only gay if balls touch . 
Getting my haircut tomorrow by < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE>'s mother . Hopefully she doesn't fuck up or anything ; I don't want to get a buzzcut ever again . xP 
So , Tempestt Bledsoe ( the child actress who played < PROPFEMALE > on The Cosby Show ) went on Celebrity Ghost Stories recently and described a figure that had appeared at the foot of her bed but never moved until it disappeared when she went into the light . The ghost she described to the dramatic re-enacting crew ? Looked exactly like < PROPMALE > Cosby . xD 
< PROPMALE > Seger's \Turn The Page\ " will never be the same to me again after today . Nothing better then screaming every lyric out of the window of a vehicle in downtown < PROPMALE > City . Especially at 4-lane stoplights . " 
Finally going to get my permit today . Probably going to fail , but whatever . Oh ya , and my speakers no longer work because Windows doesn't like that I don't have a valid copy of it . <.< 
So , it's possible that I'm not going to be able to get my permit today because we can't find my birth certificate . This wouldn't piss me off quite as much if it didn't take two or three years for the State Department to get their shit together and print one out and send it to me . <.< 
No sound until at least Thursday when I get my new confirmation code for Windows . DX I can't live like this ! 
Well , there's literally nothing to do without my sound system , sooo I suppose I'ma get off the computer and do nothing all day tomorrow . :/ 
I'm going insane !!!!!!! DX I can't live without my music ! D: \ 
Please , someone come save me from this hell . Someone tell me they have no plans and would like to < PROPFEMALE > out ! :( 
Fuck it , I'm using Dad's computer to watch a movie or something . I can't stand just sitting here in silence . 
Sound ! :D 
It's taking me for fucking ever to watch Sherlock Holmes . I keep pausing and reading the news or getting on this damned site ! xD 
has got an epic day planned with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Hendren to end his summer vacation the best way possible ! ^_^ 
For four fortnights I have fled from my fortress , \ 
Foraging forests five footsteps in length . \ 
Fortitude found within 40oz bottles , \ 
Flowing like flies from your face . \ 
From your face ! 
Today is the 65th Anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima and Monday will be the 65th anniversary of Nagasaki's bombing . The Hibakusha ( survivors of the Nuclear bombings , of which there are 227,000 remaining ) have banded together and urged the international community to commit to nuclear disarmament . It's about time that the world rid itself of these monstrous weapons once and for all . 
Nothing better then getting covered in freshly hacked apple sauce while weed-eating under an apple tree , let me tell ya . <.< It's even better when the fucking rotten ones fly up into your mouth . 
I need to find something to occupy my time . I don't want to watch a movie because I'm still hoping that I'll get to go to < PROPFIRST>'s party today , but I highly doubt I'll be going now anyway . :/ Hrm , decisions decisions . 
From this point on \BRB\ " shall now be \ " Be are be\ " and \ " IDK\ " is \ " I decay . \"" 
I will buy us an acre of some land in the city . We could live there together or I'll live alone less happy , but I'll live ; unfortunately . 
People are my religion , because I believe in them . \ 
People are my enemies and people are my friends . \ 
I have faith in my fellow man , and I only hope that he has faith in me . 
Got myself a motherfuckin ' Conan O'Brien shirt today at Hot Topic ! $22 , but it was totally worth every < PROPFEMALE > . I'm definitely not waiting to wash it , I'm wearing that shit proudly tomorrow . :D 
I want a Hippie < PROPFEMALE > Drum . Now ! D: \ 
But I don't have the money for that sort of shit . :/ 
Tried to switch out of 3rd period because my friend , the only part about the class that is tolerable , was supposed to switch out . Now she's not switching out . If they put me in < PROPMALE > tomorrow I'ma be pissed . 
If the religious right wants to ban gay marriage because Leviticus tells them homosexuality is wrong , then why aren't they out rallying to put people to death for going to church on the Sabbath instead of resting ? Why aren't they banning multi-fabric clothing , beard trimmers , piercings , tattoos , and all other things that their god deems immoral ? 
Ten Masked Men , I love you ! Your covers . Just . Amazing . 
Facebook IM , stop being a bitch to me . I never signed out , okay ?! Stop it ! D:< 
Dammit , I forgot all about the free medical care at the high school this weekend . I haven't been to a doctor in 2-3 years . :( 
No other musician matches the level of obsession which I have for < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > . Just wanted to put that out there . 
Listening to old Mate . Feed . Kill . Repeat . songs from when Anders Colsfeni was Slipknot's lead vocalist . I don't dislike his singing style , but if he had stuck with the band then Slipknot would definitely just be another mood-based band rather than a band I can listen to at any point . 
You can't see California without < PROPMALE > Brando's eyes ! 
You fucking cunts , get off of my back ! I don't wanna do a show with your shitty fuckin ' band - you suck , they suck , guess what , get fucked ! I can't think of any other words to say but fuck ! Don't drag our opinions , our opinions are great ! It's new school face motherfuckers I hate ! 
Twilight : A movie about necrophilia , zoophilia/bestiality , and paedophilia , with the hidden message of abstinence . 
Busy . Fucking . Week . I've got to go over to Tavie's after school tomorrow and get her computer to fix up because it's royally fucked , then I've got to go visit with my mom on Wednesday , then hanging out with Char on Thursday , and on top of all of that I have homework all week , including assignments for tomorrow and Wednesday that I'm not going to finish on time . 
Ho-ly shit . Tavie's case was by far the nastiest , dustiest thing that I've ever opened up . It took me 15 minutes to blow out all the dust , and about 10 minutes of that was taking care of the mere three fans . How her computer didn't catch on fire prior to it getting infected is beyond my reprehensible comprehension . 
Effectively blasting Space Oddity by < PROPFIRST > Bowie at the moment . Shaking the whole house because I don't give a fuck what my neighbors think if it's in the case of Bowie , dammit ! 
I finally got Tavie's computer fixed !! :D I feel so accomplished . 
Today was fucking awesome . < PROPMALE > out with Char and saw someone I knew nearly every time I was outside of the car . :P 
Going to Pizza Plus for about two or three hours . Jennee's working and I've got nothing to do , so I'm just going to bug her all day . :P 
I'll remain unperturbed by the joy and the madness that I encounter everywhere I turn . I've seen it all along , in book and magazines ; like a twitch before dying . 
Re-reading old comments on Mespace is like taking a step back in the past . It's odd seeing how much has changed since just September of last year , especially between certain friends and I . Some I've stopped talking to altogether , some I barely get to speak to anymore , and some have developed into siblings after at first being rather awkward friends . lol 
I am in a position where it would be inherently dishonest to deny a certain predilection for rumps what exceed the nominal ? size . I , like other men , can no longer ignore the facts : when a lady enters the room possessing a waist disproportionately small as compared to her fairly notable rear accoutrement , one is prone to becoming inescapably physiologically aware . 
I had my hair straightened today by < PROPFIRST > and Tavie . :O It basically looked the same to me , and after about two hours it's indistinguishable from my regular hair , but it's softer now , I suppose . lol\ 
P.S. Tavie doesn't know how to gently comb someone else's hair . D: 
Finally decided to change my name back to Zac < PROPMALE > . Of course , Skazac hasn't gone and never plans to leave , but no longer is that my \Facebook official\ " birth name . " 
1st Law - The < PROPMALE > can do no harm . \

Two perfect quotes from my brother in 10 minutes :\ 
\Fucking kids these days ; grow a gender ! \ " \ 
Janne Wirman is amazing . His work in Children of Bodom and Warmen is too much for me to handle . Epicness overload . 
What a dinner : Two chocolate Poptarts and a Kaiser roll . 
Meh , fuck it , I don't want to deal with the drama and the retarded hyperness of several of my friends ; I'm not going to the game . I'll just sit around and watch < PROPFIRST > Dawkins documentaries or something . 
A man is lying on the street ; some punk has chopped off his head , and I'm the only one who stops to see if he's dead ! Turns out he's dead . 
Note to self : Never start a conversation with Dad before going to take a piss . \ 
A passing mention of a skit on The Daily Show , which talked about Fox News disparaging the Park51 Community Center for having loose ties to Alwaleed Bin-Talal despite their direct ties to him ( he's a 7% owner of Newscorp ) , eventually ended on the \Double Moon\ " Mars hoax about an hour and a half later . " 
Listening to Gregorian chants , symphonies , and other classical/clerical compositions . I feel like a serial killer . xP 
Ah , another day of boredom as all the little ones go off to church . * sigh * West Wing , prepared to have about half a season melted into my brain by the end of the day . 
\With an ass's jawbone 
I want an all black suit with a purple tie and I want to wear it on informal occasions on a whim , whenever be that the proper bursts of randomness hit me . 
Life is looking up for me , at the moment . Kick-ass suit soon because I'm escorting a kick-ass girl to homecoming , I'm enjoying most ( if not all ) of my classes , I'm spending a lot of time hanging out with friends as of late due to the very little homework , and so much more that I can't elaborate on and still fit in this status . (: I love life and all of you people in mine . :D 
My life is a < PROPMALE > bit confusing at the moment , but I know one thing for sure , I'm going to fucking Pizza Plus and I'ma talk to good ole JenShep all afternoon . :D 
Grrr-eat , I re-injured my fucking knee tonight and then I had to walk home from Food Lion . I was staggering and limping about with a 42oz bottle of Sweet Tea that looks kind of like a liquor bottle and a cop fucking pulled over to ask me if I was drunk . <.< 
Fuck this goddamn day . Not going anywhere for a week or so . I'm just going to fucking focus all of tomorrow on doing chores and homework and getting this asshole off of my damned back . 
xD My mom just got pulled over while I was in the car . Amazing . 
On Facebook .... from my mom's house ! :O 
i hate laughing , but love little children !!!!!!!!!!

Great day today with Tavie , < PROPFIRST > , and < PROPMALE > . :D 
The two most badass of badasses : < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Poe and < PROPFIRST > Tecumseh < PROPMALE > . After them is Sherlock Holmes and < PROPMALE > Bartlet ( though they're both fictional , I will always recognize their existence ) . Just saying . 
Thanks a lot for glitching , Facebook ; I really love rewriting my fucking notes , < PROPMALE > . <.< 
Worst day in quite a while . ISS in the morning because a first-year teacher overreacted to something I said in class today , Dad's pissed at me and I'm probably not going to leave the house for quite some time , plus I have to go to some dumbass paren t-t eacher conference on Thursday . <.< 
Thanks for the Senate seat in Delaware , < PROPFEMALE > Palin ! You know , your party stood a pretty good < PROPMALE > at taking Biden's former seat this year , but then you stuck your nose in things . Oh , and thanks for New Hampshire , Tea Partiers ! You basically just handed the Democrats the Senate , now how about a little help with the House , huh ? 
Datin ' my brother again . Oooooh yeeeaahh . ;D 
Well , I don't get to escort < PROPFIRST > to Homecoming any longer , meaning that I can't have my epic-ass suit . < PROPFEMALE > sigh , oh well ; I can wait for Prom to get the epicness , I suppose . 
Accidentally slit my wrist while hauling/maneuvering tree branches around my yard . Luckily it's not deep and it didn't bleed all too much ; still going to get called an emo in school on Monday by all my friends who used to cut and know about my disdain for the practice . I know of it . 
< PROPFIRST > Bartlett is a pretty amazing movie , in my humble opinion . 
has mastered the < PROPMALE > of brewing tea . :D 
woke up way too early today . I do believe that a West Wing marathon is in proper taste , as such . 
House Fall Preview , I are disappoint . Why must you revolve around the relationship of Cuddy and House ? D: 
I completely forgot today was Sunday in between about 6:45 and now . o.O 
\You Are A Pirate\ " from Lazy Town on repeat . Always the best way to end a long day . " 
broke up a 6th graders ' argument today by acting like a total douche to the bitch of the two . The one was saying she was going to dream about killing the other tonight ; I knocked the little prep to the ground by telling her that she can't control the workings of her subconscious . She said she would do it anyway , so I proceeded to sing every word she said very immaturely . :D 
Seriously Mom , I understand that you have some faint < PROPFEMALE > to see your son now that you no longer live with him , even if you didn't have that urge while you lived here , but visiting at 9:30 to walk on our treadmill is just pathetic . Leave my fucking house . <.< 
Hows the world so small when the world is so large ? And what made the world ; could I please speak to whos in charge ? Everything is real , but its also just as fake . From your daughters birthday party to your grandmothers wake . And your bipolar illness ; it comes and it goes . Your parasympathetic nervous system reacts , and youre in fight or flight mode ! 
What the hell ! D: I was all ramped up for Bow Tie Awareness Week , had invited nearly every one of my friends , and then it is just randomly cancelled out of nowhere ?! D:< \ 
Fuck that , I'm still wearing a bow tie during the week of April 3-10 , 2011 . 
My dad came home and tole me to heat up some leftover chicken from Tuesday for dinner saying , \It's tasty and delightful . \ " \ 
Glee is actually pretty damn awesome . Don't care what you people say . :P 
You ever get to that point in the middle of the night that you know you're about to become too tired to get up and take a shower before heading to bed , but you've already reached the point where the last thing you want to do is stand for 30 minutes ? That's me right now . < PROPFEMALE > sigh . 
I'm going to try to start a \Draft Bredesen for US Senate\ " movement in 2012 . A popular 
Glad I didn't decide to take a morning shower today . I just performed the most disgusting cleanup job in my garage in order to prepare my dad's old truck for sale to my uncle . I had footlong strings of dust all over me . 
So , this week my mind has been focused on politics and rarely anything else . My love for constant analysis of political elections in order to predict electoral outcomes , thinking of political strategies for current and future political campaigns , and clarifying my political opinions to myself and others on all the topics of the day is undying . I'm an odd , little political junkie/nerd , I know , but fuck it . 
Fuck you , HBO ! Your video streaming sucks so much ; just give Hulu the rights to stream your shows already . I want to watch Real Time with < PROPMALE > Maher's Overtime segment , but I can't do that if the video has to buffer after each word someone speaks . 
So , turns out that my Dad never actually lost my birth certificate ; my mom is simply insane and decided to take it from his file cabinet before she moved out of our house and kept it a secret from us until this morning . Needless to say , I'm going to go try for my permit sometime this week now that I have all of the necessary identification forms . 
I've been trying to read about three article topics all day : < PROPFEMALE>'s under-appreciation of the yuan ; Iyad Allawi's refusal to form a coalition government in Iraq with Nouri al-Maliki as Prime Minister ; Palestinian President Mahmous Abbas's vow to continue peace talks despite < PROPMALE>'s refusal to place an indefinite freeze on settlements in the West Bank , but I can't bring myself around to reading them . Damn you , ADHD ! 
72 more hours until my Arbitrarily-get-money-and-praise-for-having-been-born-on-a-day-upon-which-trillions-of-individuals-over-the-course-of-human-history-have-been-born ( not to count the amount of other sentient creatures born/hatched/split/etc . on the date as well ) day !! :D 
If a woman proclaiming to be the < PROPFEMALE > of the Night came at me squealing what I always thought to be a flute as a child then I would be pretty fucking scared . 
Just had an hour-long conversation with my former best friend ( he had to move away and we've seen less and less of each other ever since , for understandable reasons ) and now we've planned out that he's going come back to < PROPMALE > to stay the night on Friday night and < PROPFEMALE > out at the Apple Festival Friday and Saturday . I'm feeling great . :D 
Hey all you people ! Hey all you people ! Hey all you people , won't you listen to me ?! I just had a sandwich ! No ordinary sandwich !! I just had a sandwich filled with jellyfish jelly !!!! :D 
But this grill is not a home ! This is not the stove I knooow ! \ 
I would trade it all away , if you'd come back to staaay ! \ 
This kitchen's not the same , without you ! \ 
It's just a greeeasy - It's just a greeeeasy spooooon ; without yooooouuuu !!! \ 
I can't stop singing/listening to Spongebob songs . o.O 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , stop exploiting the childhood memories of so many hundreds of millions of people , you money-hungry douchebag ! You're going to re-release all six < PROPFEMALE > Wars films in 3D ?! \ 
1 . ) 3D is an over-used fad that needs to fucking die already . \ 
2 . ) The quality of 3D movies that weren't originally shot to be made into 3D movies are absolute shit ; especially movies shot IN THE 70s AND 80s !!! 
Hrm , Dad seems pretty pissed that I don't want to go visit my mom today . \ 
..... Fuck it , don't care . Back to watching TV on the internet . :D 
Face : Hey , Zac ! You've been relatively clear of all acne for a couple of weeks now ; isn't it great ?! \ 
Me : Fuck ya , man ! Oh , guess what ? I got plans in a couple of days ! :D \ 
Face : That's fucking cool , dude ! Anyway , talk to you later . \ 
* Couple of days later*\ 
Face : Yo , dude ! Got a new shipping of acne in today ! Have fun ! \ 
Me : FFFFFFUUUUUUUU- 
Had a pretty amazing birthday thanks to all of those who wished me a happy one , and especially < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Hendren , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Braswell , and < PROPFIRST > ( I haven't added her on Facebook yet , which I need to do right now , actually ; thanks for reminding me , status ) . (: 
I do believe I'm going to sit back and enjoy my copy of The Way of the Bodhisattva ( English Translation of the Bodhicaryavat ? ra with a foreword from the current Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso ) on this fine day . I'll go to the Apple Festival tomorrow instead . 
got his signed copy of Anarchy Evolution in the mail , along with Bad Religion's 15th studio album The Dissent of Man , in the mail today ! A rather nice post-birthday present , if I do say so myself . ^_^ 
< PROPMALE > Murdoch , owner and CEO of News Corporation , the mother company of Fox News , came out for amnesty for the 11-12 million illegal immigrants within the United States already before the House Judiciary Committee along with New York City Mayor < PROPFIRST > Bloomberg . If only more conservative leaders could follow Mr. Murdoch's example and support this respectable plan of action on the road to Immigration Reform . 
Depriving myself of sleep tonight to get back on schedule for school and such . I'll probably stay up until about 8- 9:00 this morning and I'll shoot for waking up around 1:30 - 2:00 pm ; that should suffice . 
I feel like < PROPMALE > from Pokèmon ; my eyes won't fucking open all the way . I was woken up waaaaay too early . 
El Matador's with Dad ! :D 
Went to The Highway Boutique with Dad after El Matador's . My dad is awesome . :D 
is at < PROPFEMALE > Blackman's house . :D 
Splitting headaches are great if you're behind on sleep . I just slept from 11:45 pm- 6:30 am , woke up and tried to get ready for school , then went back to bed from 6:55 am- 1:01 pm for a grand total of 12 hours and 51 minutes of sleep . 
It's sadly telling of our society when legislators within our government can stand up and advocate banning someone from teaching within our school systems simply because of their sexual orientation or the fact that they are an unwedded mother and yet that legislator can still be respected and revered . 
Woke up at 2:09 and can't seem to get back to sleep . * yawn * Meh , let's see what's on Hulu . 
is at his mother's house , wishing oh so hard that he wasn't . * sigh * 
In an interview with FHM in December 2001 , vocalist < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > revealed that while recording vocals for the song ' Iowa ' he was completely naked , vomiting all over himself and cutting himself with broken glass . Explaining this , he said , \that's where the best stuff comes from . You've got to break yourself down before you can build something great . \ " \ 
got Sweeney < PROPMALE > in the mail today and watching Glee now . Such a gay , musical day . :P 
The new episode of Glee was so sad . D: But it finally helped me to establish who my favorite character is . < PROPMALE > is by far the coolest because he's a gaytheist ( my term for gay atheists ) and < PROPFIRST > Colfer is an amazing actor , as was his rendition of \I wanna hold your hand . \"" 
I wish I had something purple to wear on the 20th of October to honor the victims of homophobic abuse . :( 
just deleted his MySpace account . :O 
Sweeney < PROPMALE > ! :D 
There's a hole in the world like a great black pit and it's filled with people who are filled with shit ! And the vermin of the world inhabit it . 
Sweeney < PROPMALE > songs and Evolutionary Biology as taught by Dr. < PROPMALE > Graffin , lead singer of Bad Religion . Greatest way to end an evening which I've had planned out in months . 
had himself a darn good time t'night Feeshy Murd'rin ' with Char . 
is fucking excited for Homecoming Week's Monster Day on Tuesday . I'm going to be a zombie thanks to one Miss < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Hendren . :D It's an overused monster and probably a lot of people will attempt it , but fuck it ; I like me some zombies . 
Starting the process of cutting my jeans for Monster day . :D 
The pants-ripping process is complete . I've gotten them to a nice ragged look and I'm happy with them . :D 
I just read a like < PROPFEMALE > that said , \I was alive on 10/10/10 at 10:10:10 am\ " \ 
My mom is honestly the most embarrassing and frustrating person I know . >.< I hate Tuesdays . 
I need some suggestions for my alternate persona's name once I buy a Victorian suit . Think top-class , so don't be afraid to add in a < PROPMALE > numeral at the end . :P 
was yelled at for praisin ' Satan in the Commons today . If the Gideons are allowed to break the law and promote their religion of choice at our school 3 or 4 times a year , then I sure as hell can praise something that I don't even believe in . 
Anyone that happens to read this , I would appreciate if you gave me your brutally honest opinion of me . Don't hold ANYTHING back ; no matter if you fucking hate me and have no real reason to have me on Facebook . Whether it be on this status , on my wall , or via message , let me know . \ 
[ I'll probably re-post this so I can get more and more people to post , because I can and such . ] 
At the end of the day I had a great time , was welcomed into Grindy as the < PROPFEMALE > , and it's all topped off with a pocket full of tampons that I carried to the game for a friend without pockets and forgot to give back . 
This weekend has done nothing but remind me that everyone around me is with someone as I remain unpaired . I are disappoint . 
Eh , I'll just drown my sadness out with a marathon of Tool music and a full list of chores tomorrow so as to reacquire my trademark \fuck it\ " attitude before the next school week begins . Wouldn't want to be all depressive whilst physically in front of people ; I don't have good enough reasons to do that silly shit . Going to bed now . " 
I honestly do not see me getting through tomorrow without being at least partially dick-ish ; this weekend has definitely not been good to me . <.< 
I wish I had something purple to wear on Wednesday . :/ 
I have a huge rageboner for having to use the word \that\ " twice in a row . It always seems so improper and leaves me jumbling through my mind for a better phrase to use for what I'm trying to say . " 
You don't have to be gay to feel gay pride , you just have to be proud . 
To say that Americans should be Christians because the crafters of the Constitution believed in the Judeo-Christian god is like saying that all citizens of Democratic nations should be polytheistic worshipers of Zeus and various other Olympians because the crafters of the first democracy believed in the Greek Mythology . 
Tomorrow comes the day of reckoning . 
In 2009 a samurai-sword wielding drug addict burst into a bar and severed a man's left hand clean off after hearing a rumor that the man had insulted his mother . The victim then proceeded to punch the druggie directly in the face ...... with the stump of a hand which had just been cut off . That raises the bar of testicular fortitude to levels higher than ever thought possible . 
And so ends an illustrious era . \ 
R.I.P. My fateful companion , my beautiful love ; my hair . ( July ??, 2009 - October 23 , 2010)\ 
Goodnight sweet < PROPMALE > . 
Being grounded on a Sunday is the worst possible fate . I just finished The West Wing after about 2 months of procrastination , the news cycle is on halt , I don't have any movies that I particularly want to watch , and all YouTube subscriptions are eerily silent . 
Shaving is so very annoying and I look odd fully shaved . 
Holy shit , internet , stop being so sloooooooow ! D:< 
Watching Invictus . Fuck Yeah < PROPMALE > Mandela // < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > !! :D 
In the fell clutch of circumstance , I have not winced nor cried aloud . Under the bludgeonings of < PROPMALE > , my head is bloody but unbowed . Beyond this place of wrath and tears looms but the horror of the shade , and yet the menace of the years finds and shall find me unafraid . It matters not how strait the gate , how charged with punishments the scroll , I am the master of my fate : I am the captain of my soul . 
I really want to go to a Rainbow Gathering in the summer of 2012 , right after graduation . Hopefully Nationals is somewhere close-by then . 
New Glee . Goodbye for 44 minutes or so , world . 
Like my status and I'll < PROPFEMALE > on some good , ole classic copypasta by telling you : 1 ) Something I've learned about you by looking at your wall for 13 seconds . 2 ) The color you remind me of . 3 ) My first memory of you . 4 ) The animal you remind me of . 5 ) Ask something I've always wondered about you . 6 ) My favorite thing about you . 
\Now we have a group of citizens 
Sitting at home over Halloween is going to be shit , but at least I'm getting off my grounding early . Free man as of Monday . :D 
One of the biggest things about Creationists that I hate is not that they believe that the world came about through the design of a higher power , that I can handle and respect because it's their right to believe as such , but is rather the fact that most creationists think that the Big Bang Theory and Evolutionary Theory are one in the same when they are completely and utterly separate from each other . 
Firefly has been makin ' a profound impact on my vocabulary here since I've been re-watching the series . I figure I won't be talkin ' normal for about a month to come , at the least . But hey , I don't see a gorram thing wrong with that . 
I can't wait to finally be free to leave this house tomorrow . Seemingly everyone else had amazing Halloween weekends while I sat around , so to make up for that I'm just not going to come home all week . 
broke it down to some techno beats . It was a sight to behold ..... if you wish to be mentally scarred and blinded for life . :P 
Seriously people ? Chain mail in support of those who died from , are fighting , or have survived cancer ? Ya , I'm part of the \97%\ " ( a number totally fabricated to make you think what you're doing isn't popular but is for a great cause ) that won't repost that status because I don't find it necessary to reassure everyone that I think cancer sucks . " 
Tonight's Predictions :\ 
Democrats : 52-53 Senate Seats ; 207-209 House Seats\ 
Republicans : 47-48 Senate Seats ; 226-228 House Seats\ 
If I win can I be the new President , please ? :D 
Apparently my dad is running for Congress . xD The Democratic opponent to < PROPMALE > Roe ( my district's congressman ) has the exact same name as Dad's . 
So , my prediction of the Democrats ' chances in the House were incorrect , but my prediction of their Senate chances is going to come true . In the House , Republicans have won 239 seats so far , with the Democrats winning 183 and 13 races still undecided . 
You know , honestly , I'm kind of sad that < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > didn't beat < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > last night . \ 
1 . Because the Democrats really need someone tougher and more capable of leading than < PROPMALE > if they're going to have to deal with being the Senate Majority in the split congress . \ 
2 . It would prove just how insane the Tea Partiers are and hopefully let a lot of the steam out of their blimp of idiocy . 
Why is it such news that Little < PROPMALE > is out of prison ? The dude had an illegal firearm and cocaine on his tour bus , he should still be in jail for like 10-20 more years . He doe not deserve to be out in less than a year . 
Sick , sleepy , sick , sleepy , sleepy , sleepy . 
Fuck you , right hand ; why can't you stay warm like left hand , huh ? I like having feeling in you , and if you keep being a bitch with your stupid circulatory problems , then we may have some issues here real soon . 
I talk to god as much as I talk to Satan ' cause I want to hear both sides . Does that make me cynical ? There are no miracles , and this is no miraculous life . I savor hate as much as I crave love , because I'm just a twisted guy . 
\The greatest weakness of most humans is their hesitancy to tell others how they love them while they're alive . \ " - Optimus Prime " 
Fuck it , I did this a while back , but I'll jump right back on the bandwagon and do it again for the hell of it . Like this here status and I'll tell you :\ 
1 . Something I learned about you after looking at your wall for 13 seconds . \ 
2 . The color that reminds me of you . \ 
3 . My first memory of you . \ 
4 . The animal that reminds me of you . \ 
5 . I'll ask something I've always wondered about you . \ 
6 . My favorite thing about you . 
There's nothing I hate more than throwing up . Especially 6-8 times in 2 minutes . 
Scratch that , there's nothing I hate more than cleaning the sink after I throw up 6-8 times in 2 minutes . That's just nasty . 
My dad has been listening to < PROPFEMALE > Manson non-stop yesterday and today . I can't help but to find it hilarious that a 54-year old is rocking out to Manson . haha 
Not going in tomorrow . Extremely weak from lack of actual food in my stomach , yet I'm not hungry . I don't want to over-stuff myself because I'm afraid of puking again . Ugh , I think I have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder . lol 
Today my dad is 55 . Happy Birthday Dad ! :D 
I really wish I had the funds to begin my collection of various different religious and/or occult texts . First off , I want to start with < PROPMALE>'s Necronomicon , The Holy Qur'an , and the Satanic Bible . Then I want to move on to various different Eastern religions , such as Buddhism , Taoism , Confucianism , Jainism , etc . Eventually I want this all to lead up to me getting my hands on a couple of 400-500 year old bibles . 
Holy shit , I almost died . I saw a news article with a picture of < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > hugging a woman and the banner underneath said , \A Tragic Hollywood Crime\ " and I thought that someone had killed him . D: Turns out it was the woman instead . " 
Air Hockey is an intense sport . 
Received my ACT test preparation guide in today . Now time to prepare . 
Is it sad that I'm actually really happy that we cleaned out the garage today because Dad gave me my choice of his old college textbooks ? Got a couple Math books , two chemistry books , a physics book , a book of various different literature , a book about various inventions throughout history which led to new inventions later on , and a few others . 
I'm having an easier time motivating myself to read a college-level Economics textbook than ' The Poisonwood Bible ' . What does that say about that book ? 
My mom constantly talks about how she misses me and my brother and hates that she has to be away from us because we won't agree to live with her , and then on the one day that I offer to her to spend the entire day with her ( since I've missed the past two weeks ) she never shows up to pick me up . Goes to show how much she truly misses me ; thanks for reaffirming my idea that you never cared , < PROPFEMALE > . 
I like telling dirty jokes , and I like smoking < PROPFEMALE > meth , but darling I love you . And I like laughing at retards , and I like throwing rocks at dogs , but darling I love you . I love you like the < PROPFEMALE > and stars , when little kids get hit by cars , girl you know it's true . Darling , I love you . 
Who cares ?! He's a cunt ! His father was a cunt , he's a cunt , and he's going to have a bunch of little cunty kids someday . 
Ever reached the point of exhaustion where one eye is just barely open and the other is about half way , and yet you still can't get to sleep ? Not such a good feeling , I found out . 
It's Thanksgiving everyone ! What are you thankful for ?! :D \ 
I'm thankful for all the Native < PROPFEMALE > ns which the pilgrims , seeking religious freedom in the New World , declared pagans and slaughtered ruthlessly and without mercy . (: Have a great Thanksgiving , and be sure to gorge yourself on all of the traditional , fattening foods . Enjoy yet another Food Holiday in < PROPFEMALE > . 
Only the most brutal and manliest of men piss sitting down or refuse to pull off an all-nighter due to sheer exhaustion . One of those is a reference , but which one ? No one will ever know ! Unless .... you know , someone else gets the reference . Then I guess someone else will know besides me . 
< PROPFIRST > W . Bush almost choked on a pretzel during Tea with the < PROPFEMALE > of England . Barack Obama got elbowed in the face during a basketball game with friends and was required to get 12 stitches on his lip . Oh , how times have changed . haha 
Well , the extended Native-American-Genocide Day is over now with my last bite of Turkey . Now I need something to do for the next couple of days . :/ 
Finally watching < PROPMALE > . Thank fuck for Netflix . :D 
Holy shit . First episode of < PROPMALE > was so fucking enticing . This may fast become a favorite show of mine . 
I hate watching movies or TV shows about serial killers . Makes me feel inferior intellectually , and then it causes me to think in convoluted , complex manners in order to try to think more along their lines , and then I just get creeped out by the fact that I'm trying to think like a serial killer . 
Okay , I'm rather pissed at AMC now . I watched the first full episode of The Walking Dead online about three weeks ago on Hulu and expected new episodes to be posted each week , but it turns out that they're not posting any more online at all . The first episode was just to get you hooked . Ya , well , fuck you and your marketing strategies because they worked , dammit , and I don't have a TV anymore ! D:< 
I have now ordered my new jacket ; it should be here within a day or two . \ 
Also : NEW YORK IN A LESS THAN THREE WEEKS !! :D :D :D 
Do I dislike my mother ? Yes , yes I do . Do I still wish that she cared about me enough to see me every once in a while ? Unfortunately so . :/ 
I think I know why Dumbledore's death made me cry like a little bitch during ' The Half-Blood < PROPMALE >.' He's the closest thing I've ever had to a grandfather figure . lol 
All Unicoi School Goers : We are officially out tomorrow . Enjoy your extended weekend . 
Oh yay , Congress is almost ready to compromise on tax code reformations . In exchange for renewing jobless benefits , the Obama Administration has signaled that they will allow for a temporary renewal of Bush-era tax cuts . You know , because it's so fiscally responsible to cut your main source of revenue while continuing to sign checks , especially when you're already in debt . 
I really need a new , more current profile picture of me . One where I'm not staring into the non-existent souls of every mortal who lays eyes upon it . 
There's a hole in the earth like a great black pit , and it's filled with people who are filled with shit , and the vermin of the world inhabit it . 
Theres a hole in the world like a great black pit , and the vermin of the world inhabit it , and its morals arent worth what a pig could spit , and it goes by the name of London ! At the top of the hole sit a privileged few , making mock of the vermin in the lower zoo turning beauty into filth and greed . 
I got a new cat from Jennee tonight . His name is Sergeant Fatso , Emperor of < PROPFEMALE > ( I'm just calling him Sarge for short ) . It was originally Sergeant Pepper , but I changed it to Sergeant Fatso , Emperor of < PROPFEMALE > because I like making my pets royalty ( like < PROPFEMALE > the Cat , Empress of < PROPFEMALE > ) because I'm fucking weird . 
Yay ! Sarge has decided to come out from under the bed . (: He still won't leave my room , but this is big progress because not only is he roaming around my room , but he's coming to my hand and rubbing against my legs . :D 
I really wish that < PROPFIRST > Sanders was about 10 years younger so he could challenge Obama in the 2012 primary . I want him to be my president , dammit , but he's considered too old . :( 
I feel like blowing my brains out , my ear is hurting like hell and it's causing my entire left side of my head to hurt too . 
Let me tell you about a little thing I like to call ' mind over body ' . You see , whenever I start feeling sick , I just stop being sick and be awesome instead . True story . 
Great , I spilled the ashtray off my desk . Fuck being too tired to notice things ..... or clean messes , for that matter . 
I'M A GAY PONY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
--- FROM JENNEE 
STILL A GAY PONY !!!! --- Love Jennee :) 
Jennee brought back my addiction to Pokemon yellow . I know what I'm doing tonight ..... and tomorrow .... and probably the next day . 
Well , I'm back to having one cat now . Gave Sarge to my mother because he couldn't get along with < PROPFEMALE > . I'm pretty happy about it to be honest ; I liked Sarge for the 5 or so days that he was here , but no one fucks with my < PROPFEMALE > . No one . 
Four days and counting . I want it to be Saturday already so I can be in fucking New York . 
I woke up this morning to find that I had slept on a thumbtack . That is all . 
Me : Why doesn't that cop car have any decals ? \ 
Dad : [ whispering ] It's a stealthy cop . \ 
Me : There are lights on the roof . \ 
Dad : [ whispering ] It's kind of a stealthy cop . 
Me : That video is of a guy tying a shoe and the caption says , \This is your dream . \ " \ 
Arch Enemy marathon until < PROPFEMALE > comes to pick me up , then leaving for New York tomorrow morning . 
Made it to New York . We got lost for a bit and almost ran over a few J-walkers , but we made it safely in the end . 
I have become the scapegoat of everyone's hate . D: 
What an eventful day : Went to the Met , was harassed by a crack dealer for 30 minutes or so , my group of friends ( < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Braswell , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Hendren , < PROPFEMALE > Kemker , and Avent ( don't have him added . ) called everyone in Time Square faggots by making a custom Hershey bar , and then we all played Red Rover for 2 < PROPMALE > or so back to < PROPFEMALE>'s car . 
Prearing to leave NYC . Yay for 12-13 hour drives . 
Well , I made it back from New York City in one piece . Now just get back to the slow , boring < PROPMALE > routine . 
Pajamas , stocking < PROPFEMALE > from Mom , turkey , mashed potatoes , corn , YouTube videos , and death metal . Great way to spend my day . 
Downloading Christmasasarus Volumes 1-5 . Thinking of getting a Bubblegum Octopus t-shirt , TheAmazingAtheist's documentary , and a shit ton of Physics books with my Christmas money . 
All I can think to buy with my money left over from New York are several books covering varied topics of theoretical physics ( such as String Theory , M-Theory , The Big Bang , Dark Matter , and how the technology of the < PROPFEMALE > Trek series could function ) , a biographical documentary about Terroja Kincaid (' TheAmazingAtheist ' ) , and cigarettes . I have odd priorities . 
Go to Google . \ 
Search for tt0119174 . 
I just saw a commercial on YouTube that pronounced ' bowels ' as ' balls ' and all I heard was , \Concerned that you're not emptying your balls completely ? \"" 
Shoveled half of my driveway and a little walking path to the back door and to the garage on my patio ; without gloves . I feel like never going outside again . 
I kind of don't want to finish The Human Centipede just because of how annoying these two girls are . 
I have just bought ' The Album Formerly Known As 8-Legged Dance Moves ' by Bubblegum Octopus and all three of Giggle the Ozone's albums . Fuck ya for supporting independent artists ! 
I bought ' Understanding Power ' by Noam Chomsky and ' The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy ' by < PROPMALE > Adams ( all fives books of the Hitchhiker series in one ) , as well as an A Perfect Circle t-shirt tonight . I feel like such a money waster considering I already bought 10 books and 4 albums last night , but it was worth it . Plus I've still got cash on hand . 
Black-out curtains are bad for sleep schedules . I had my first experience of waking up to a pitch black room at 1:00 pm today . 
Here they come again , hairy spider leggings . I just wanna run ; save me from this insanity , I just want them to let me be ! Spiders in my clothes , eating up my good coat . Spiders in my clothes , great now I have to go shopping . 
Got 6 books in the mail today : Physics of the Impossible , Hyperspace , Quintessence , Parallel Worlds , The Elegant Universe , and The Moral Landscape . :D \ 
Two about multi-dimensional physics , one on String Theory , one on Dark Matter , one on Subjective morality and the scientific ( evolutionary ) means for its existence , and a theoretical physics book about the plausibility of time travel , teleportation , phasers , etc . 
Alright , sooooo , please tell me that I have someone in my first and fourth periods :\ 
Modern History [ Kornegay]\ 
Child Lifespan Development ( or something like that ) [ Clark/Clarke]\ 
English III AP [ Seagroves]\ 
Chemistry II [ Bolt ] 
Well , I couldn't go to sleep , but I can't now otherwise I won't wake up until three , so I'm just going to have to rough it . Now I need to figure out what the hell I'm going to do all day . :/ 
Am I really so bored that I'm looking up information on the Federalist Party ? Yes , yes I am . 
I love that The Daily Beast treats the character's from The West Wing as actual political figures . On their list of \Most Memorable Chiefs of Staff\ " they listed < PROPFIRST > McGarry as the most memorable and in a similar list for Presidents they listed < PROPMALE > Bartlet as most memorable . " 
Heard < PROPMALE > Rice in Hot Topic on Thursday . First time I've ever heard his music play in < PROPFEMALE > . :D They have earned my respect back despite all the stupid < PROPFIRST > Bieber shit . 
Applying for jobs . * sigh * I don't like the idea of having to work in fast food . I'm really hoping one of the IGAs or Dollar General's will take me . 
They thought they were food ; they did not know what they'd done . 
Fuck your Mitsubishi , I've a horse outside . Fuck your Honda Civic , I have a horse outside . Fuck your Suburu , I've a horse outside . If you're looking for a ride , I've a horse outside . 
Be afraid of Jesus , because he's going to fuck you up old school style . 
I'm rather pleased with the irony that I sit directly in front of a book about how misguided atheism is in my AP English class this semester . 
\A prayer was like a tickle . Sooner or later God would have to look down to see what was tickling his bum . \ " - ' Mister Pip ' by < PROPMALE > Jones\

The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus was pretty good , but it wasn't comparable to last night's choice of \SLC Punk ! \"." 
I love that one of my ' memorable ' statuses is : \Remember kids : It's only gay if balls touch . \"" 
I just lost the game . 
May I just say fuck this ? Going to go drown my mind in British comedy . 
What's so good about Democracy ?! Democracy is freedom of thought ! And belief ! And speech ! That's what's so good about it , you degraded heap of smelliness . Now get out of my way before I set fire to you ! 
Life restored . Boxxy is back ! :D \ 
Yes , this is last week's news to inhabitants of the internet , but I don't devote my life to the computer any more , sooooo deal with it . 
Well , I'm glad I have an extra two hours of time to work on my essay tonight . More time to procrastinate that way . 
I wish to reach out and touch something thousands upon thousands of light years away ; to be seen and marveled at long past my point of extinction . I wish to provide the stepping stones for far greater things with my passing . I wish to be like the stars . 
That essay only took a matter of an hour ; wasn't that bad . Back to watching British comedy . 
Seriously , either give us a two-hour delay to hold us over until the morning or just call out school already . I don't want to have to wake up at 6:30 tomorrow ; I'll never get back to sleep . 
I wonder if it means anything is fucked up about a person if they almost get stabbed and they don't feel afraid by it , but rather excited instead ? 
What's this ? Developmental psychology and evolutionary references in an English essay about < PROPFIRST > Twain's view that conformity is in human nature ? I better get a good grade . 
Woo , no school ! 
I love you like the < PROPFEMALE > and stars ; when little kids get hit by cars . Girl , you know it's true . Darling , I love you . 
Dad : I saw dog bite a man three weeks ago . He cried . [ ... ] The dog , not the man . \ 
Me : [ Laughing . ]\ 
Dad : You think that's funny ?! That was heart-wrenching ! I'll never know why that dog was crying while biting that man ! Was it because he was gaining vengeance for the death of his family ?! I'll never know !! 
I do say that I'm feeling a wee bit sickly . I do not like this in the slightest , as I do not want to use up my last excused day of school this early in the semester . 
Yay for acid burps and stomach pains ! :( 
I want Chicken Broth ! D:< The demands of the boy who pukes acid shall be heeded ! 
I'm going to bed , fuck this shit . 
I slept for 14 hours . Being sick makes life so exciting ! 
It still astounds me that my grandmother was 48 when my brother was born , which my mom is turning this year , and that she was 54 when I was born , which my dad just surpassed last year . 
The house is quite and still and then :\ 
[ Dad with muffled sounds of Counterstrike gunshots in the background ] Fight that bad boy ! 
Going to watch the State of the Union address and then read 9 different reviews on it from all of my favorite Daily Beast contributors , plus a few new names who just intrigued me . Then I've got to try to find < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST>'s and < PROPFEMALE > Bachmann's rebuttals . 
I love my sound system . (: I had the volume half way up and was able to hear it in every part of the house and do dishes to my < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Jihad playlist . :D 
Be kind to those you love , and be kind to those you don't . But for god's sake , you gotta be kind ; and respectful , because we're all one soul . Be the best fucking human you could be ! 
I can't sleep , so if we're not out tomorrow , UCHS , I'm going to be quite irritated . 
I've tried twice now ; I can't sleep . Especially if I keep thinking that spiders are crawling in my hair because the back of my head is touching my blanket . 
Three fucking essays due tomorrow . Guess that's what I get for missing a day and a half of class . :/ 
I can't write with this much detail off of less than 8 hours of sleep in two days . I'm taking a break and probably just taking a late grade on my third assignment because I'm going to sleep at like 10 tonight . 
My dad is listening to Ke-dollar sign-ha . o.O 
What . A kickass . Weekend . Even though it was only a day and a half , it was probably the best I've had in a rather long time . 
Introduced most of Drama I to nintendocore , turned at least one person on to Bubblegum Octopus , did a good job on presenting my vocal abilities to the class ; overall just had a pretty fuck-ya day . 
\The great pleasure in life is doing what people say you can not do . \ " - < PROPFIRST > Bagehot " 
Ill probably be some kind of scientist , building inventions in my space lab in space . Ill end world hunger ; Ill make dolphins speak . Work through the daytime , spend my nights and weekends perfecting my warrior robot race ; building them one laser gun at a time . I will do my best to teach them about life and what its worth . I just hope that I can keep them from destroying the Earth . 
Today allowed me to realize that I need to be less cautious and contemplative about things all the time and instead learn to make brash , off-the-cuff decisions on occasion . In that spirit , I must take actions in my life which normally I would object to in order to attempt to further my happiness to a greater extent . 
I just found out that Netflix has The Office on instant queue all the way up to Season 6 . Fuck . Yes ! 
I just watched a video that came to the shocking conclusion that the Kill < PROPMALE > movies weren't original ! Egad , really ?! A movie that basically parodied the most outrageous staples of the revenge-drama genres ( Martial Arts and Western ) isn't original ?! My life will never be the same in now knowing this . 
While all of you suckers are watching the Superbowl tonight , I'll be watching The Office . Suck on that ! 
Good , now I don't have to have another 6-day week this week , just five . Next week , though , come the six days again . 
If < PROPFEMALE > Giffords is fully recovered and capable of taking on the stress of a statewide campaign by the time the first primaries roll around and she announces her candidacy for Kyl's seat , then I see her name on a presidential ballot one day if she keeps on good ground with the party . Her story is too good for Democratic officials not to want to seize on . 
ACT today from eight to one . Let's see how I do on my first try . 
Pretty sure I did good on the ACT today . Probably scored around a 28 or 29 with how shitty I did on the Science portion . Was hoping for a 32-33 , but for the first try that's pretty good , I guess . Going to watch ' The Office ' for the rest of the night now . 
Found three of my old Advance/SP games . :D Pokemon < PROPFEMALE > , Dragonball Z : Buu's Fury , and Dragonball Z : The Legacy of Goku II . 
What's this shit ? I'm on Facebook from < PROPFIRST > Buchanan's house ? :O Unbelievable ! 
Can we please put an end to this recent surge in high school drama , everybody ? What it is about this stuff that is so appealing to you all that it's got those hormones flaring is beyond me , but how about we try to put aside our differences and get through this time of relative unaccountability in peace . Enjoy it while you have it rather than stressing over who said what and where the next fight is going to be . 
Mission accomplished ! \Color It White\ " essay completed before 10:30 . " 
Well , my plans may not have gone exactly to plan yesterday ( I didn't < PROPFEMALE > out with who I had planned to ) , but the day yielded all the planned results anyway , so I'm rather pleased . 
Let's be our own gods and take care of ourselves and those that we love . 
Everyone is going to Bonnaroo and it's depressing me . I'm a creature of envy and I want to go too , dammit ! D: 
I'm wearing my two peace shirts until the last day of Muammar al-Gaddafi's 41 and a half-year regime . It's a small gesture , but it's all I can think to do in support of those fighting for their freedoms in Libya considering I'm a lower-middle class 16-year old kid . 
Gohan : \Dad ? Dad ! Oh my god 
Three rolls and a couple handfuls of frosted mini-wheats for dinner . Dad forgot to make food and I don't have the heart to tell him that he's too damn old to remember to feed his son . :P 
Is the official MC for this year's UCHS Talent Show , as well as for this year's Chamber Show , and I've got a commercial to do during announcements tomorrow . My voice is a < PROPFEMALE > ! :D 
I'm going to feel awkward as the Talent Show MC since there will be one or two more MCs who aren't required to use a fake voice . 
Streetlight Manifesto ? Amazing . Bad Religion ? Even more amazing . Streetlight Manigesto covering Bad Religion ? Perfection . 
What a grand idea ! Impose sanctions on Libya just as al-Gaddafi's regime is on the brink of collapse . If you really cared about the people of Libya then you would have reversed W's inhumane partnership with Gaddafi and imposed sanctions on your first day in office , Mr. President . 
Day Five of wearing my homemade protest shirt ( well , homemade in the sense that I wrote on the back of a pre-existing shirt ) . I don't expect to be wearing it by Monday , but you never know ; Gaddafi is quite the determined fucker . 
It's time for a much needed break from my continuous coverage of the situation in Libya . Going to finish American Splendor and then watch Labyrinth . 
Writing a script for the Talent Show could go a lot easier if I knew for sure who the MCs were going to be and what acts were going to be performing and in what orders . Oh well , most of it will just be introducing the next acts , anyway ; I can handle rushing through it sometime next week . 
What is the measure of a person's integrity ? Is it their religion ; their political affiliation ; their intelligence ? No , it is their inability to be controlled by fear . Fear can effect how we act towards others , what we believe in religiously and politically , and it can enslave our minds from gathering more knowledge about the world around us . If fear is conquered , the world is in your hands . 
Is glad in retrospect that he didn't have to walk home in this rain thanks to the courtesy of Miss < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE>' Platt ; shit's insane . 
What the fuck ? I made a fucking 23 on my ACT ?! .... I'm just going to go fucking kill myself now . Goodbye world . 
It's times like this when I think , \What would the world be like if < PROPFIRST > Trotsky had succeeded Lenin rather than Stalin ? \"" 
I almost got pissed there for a second because I thought our Spring Break began on this year's National Day of Silence , but then I realized that it started on the 25th of April , not the 15th . ( Slight promotion intended . ) 
' The Trotsky ' was an amazing movie and today was a pretty amazing day . Hoping tomorrow will go just as great , if not better . 
Days like today really make me want to retreat into the woods , find an open place in the gaps of the treetops , and simply breath in the cool air for a relaxing meditation . It was so peaceful and serene anywhere I went . 
Every time the wind blows against my window my dad says , \I'm skeert ; come hold my hand . \"" 
Ever since I got home I feel as if there's something missing from my day , but I'm not entirely sure what it could be . :/ Also , sorry for three posts within the space of an hour . It's annoying for everyone , including myself ; I know . 
Just going to listen to the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers ' theme song on repeat and reminisce on the metaly awesomeness of this show . 
Never realized how much my brother looks like a fat Vladimir Lenin until seeing Lenin's 1895 mugshot when he was 25 . Both have the same premature balding pattern and everything ; it's pretty cool . 
Greet the greedy with gratitude and punish the poor . Caught between fat and famished , riches and rags ; a never ending war . 
Tyranny tolerated for the sake of comfort and consistency . When is the time to voice our indignation ? 
Going to watch ' The Big Boss ' . Hopefully we'll be out tomorrow so I can watch ' Enter the Dragon ' and ' Return of the Dragon ' , too . I'm feeling a < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > marathon . 
Well , I've had an amazing time with friends thus far to make this an amazing weekend , it is now time to lock myself within my domicile and become a hermit for a little while while I continue < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Fest . 
Isn't it grand how there is finally a legitimate reason for the Western powers to get involved in Arab/Middle-Eastern affairs , yet now is the time when they say , \We really shouldn't be getting involved\ " ? The government of Libya is slaughtering its citizens and the rebel movement is losing grounds due to the West's unheard of non-interventionist policy in the Arab world ; remember that . " 
I think that all the silence is worse than all the violence . Fear is such a weak emotion ; that's why I despise it . We scared of almost everything , afraid to even tell the truth . So scared of what you think of me , Im scared of even telling you . Sometimes Im like the only person I feel safe to tell it to . Im locked inside a cell in me , I know that theres a jail in you . 
I'm a part of the problem ; my problem is I'm peaceful . 
To all those asking why I'm no longer wearing my protest shirt everyday : I'm sick of the < PROPMALE > Western powers meddling in Middle Eastern/Arab affairs in order to prop up puppet regimes , but when it comes down to genuine situations which they can be of help in , they won't go anywhere close . The Libyan people are being massacred and the West is just finally showing some restraint from intervention ; how fucking grand ! 
Re-watching Dragonball Z for funsies . 
I think I've mastered Raditz's voice . Now if I can just remember how I do it so I don't have to watch an episode each time I want to use it . 
Pissed most everybody off in 3rd period because I said that I think patriotism is pointless , then in 4th we talked about morals and their origins while doing a lab . A rather good day . 
It is decided . For the research paper we're doing in AP English III , my topic is going to be arguing in favor of the one-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . 
Constitutional reforms in Egypt , Western military strikes on the Gaddafi regime ( thanks to a persistent < PROPFEMALE > for pushing for the rights of the Libyan people ) , nuclear hazard dying down in Japan ; I love how all of the sudden the world seemed to have hit a peak chaos point and now seems to be slowly but surely getting better . Let's hope the trend continues .

I wish I could ask Congressman Roe anything and everything on my mind tomorrow . I want to have the < PROPMALE > to kick his ass intellectually , but instead the administration has to field questions before they go to him . Oh well , if < PROPMALE > gets his way than at least one of my questions will be asked ; I don't expect him to be able to answer any of the questions I asked him without dancing around it entirely , so whatever . 
Well , I had decided to switch my research paper to a more controversial topic , so I went with same-sex couples ' adoption rights . However , when I asked to do it , the teacher told me that I couldn't because I wasn't going to use any studies that proved that gay adoption had negative effects on children . I tried explaining to her that no legitimate studies exist which reach that conclusion [ cont . ] 
I wish < PROPMALE > Gore had been elected and re-elected in 2000 and 2004 , < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > had been elected in 2008 and was on the safe track to being re-elected in 2012 , and then that < PROPFIRST > Cantwell would run in 2016 . Life would be so amazing . Probably , I don't know , but I'm guessing so . 
An amazing fucking time was had tonight at the Hideaway . Paralyzer and Bacalou worked in unison to give me a mental orgasm . 
\Slay anger and you will be happy 
Listen , I'm sick of seeing it , if you're not interested in politics then just say you're not , don't tell everyone that you're a Republican or Democrat simply because your parents happen to hold that political affiliation . You shouldn't blindly follow the examples of others simply because you're too intellectually lazy to formulate your own opinions . 
Two infected hands , a bruised-up back , and a sore neck were not capable of bringing me down this weekend . I had the best time I've had in a while . Went to my first actual concert ( my first time at the Hideaway ) , got a Paralyzer shirt , and spent most of my time with the gang . Very few things could have improved upon these past three days . 
Despite my few grammatical errors , I actually managed to convince someone that corporations could run for president with my ' Google for President ' essay . haha Granted , he's somewhat of a conspiracy nut and a partial burnout ( he's intelligent , but rather susceptible to bullshit ) , but still , the fact that my writing convinced him of that makes me feel good . 
This is a morbid story ' bout a fellow that had to die . He had a beautiful wife but he also had a rovin ' eye . She planted him by the roadside , she planted him by the roadside , she planted him by the roadside , for all the unfaithful husbands to see . 
has decided to attend ETSU after graduation rather than trying for Vanderbilt . No turning back this time ; this is what I want to do . I'll try for Vanderbilt later when I'm looking for Law Schools . 
Why must so many react negatively when they find out someone is an atheist ? Personally , it's never happened to me , but I know it to be a common response . Why should someone have to believe in the universe's supernatural origins in order to be a friend of yours ? As long as they are kind to you and yours , why should you deny them and theirs kindness ? 
I feel like shit . I just want to pass out and not wake up for five or six days . That would be cool . 
Chicken broth , Spicy Sweet Chili Doritos , cough drops , ice water , and DBZ . All I need to help conquer sickness . Too bad I can't go to Survive < PROPMALE > City tomorrow ; I was really looking forward to it . :( 
In 2009 I went to Las Vegas , in 2010 I went to New York City , so I suppose my only question is : where is 2011 going to see me traveling to ? 
\They do not lament over the past 
Well , gave up on my fasting already because I almost passed out yesterday and felt like I was going to throw up . It wasn't due to the fasting , it was because I didn't get a good night's sleep Friday , but I didn't have the energy to go on with my day , so I had to eat . Also , one of the lightning strikes hit really near my house and fried my network card , so I'm going to be on Dad's computer until Wednesday . 
I'm kind of sad that Into the Woods is over , but it was fun working backstage with everyone for these past four days . Everyone who had a part in it and everyone who helped out backstage and on lights and sound did an amazing job each and every performance . 
I want my network card to function again ; the internet is my life source . :( 
Watching anything history related always gets my mind continuously thinking about politics , and the fact that Republicans are starting to throw their hats into the race for President doesn't help matters . Going to have to start carrying around my \policy book\ " again so I can jot down my opinions on topics and all my random ideas . " 
I finally have internet again ! I'm so giddy . (: 
My gift is my song [ ... ] and this one's for you . And you can tell everybody , that this is your song . It may be quite simple , but now that it's done ; I hope you don't mind , I hope you don't mind , that I put down in words [ ... ] how wonderful life is , now you're in the world . 
Tomorrow will be my second participation in the annual GLSEN's 2011 Day of Silence . Are you taking the oath of silence to bring attention to anti-LGBT ( lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ) name-calling , bullying and harassment in schools ? 
Success . Not a damn word . :D 
Why the hell am I awake so early ? This is not acceptable . I have no one to talk to . D: 
Guru : \Nail ! Do we have a visitor ? \ " \ 
Why must I have the Tetris music playing on repeat in my head ?! I shall wash it out with some good old Bubblegum Octopus , or maybe Giggle the Ozone ; I can't decide yet . 
I must find my shorts somewhere in this hellhole I call a closet ! My knee is going to let out on me soon if I don't wear my brace soon , I can feel it , but I hate the way the brace feels when I wear pants . Please magically show up somewhere within these old as hell clothes , shorts ; please ? 
I'm in the mood for intellectual debate , but none of the friends I < PROPFEMALE > out with often are really interested in politics or philosophy or what have you . :/ 
Note to self : Marry someone without a crippling fear of spiders . It may be hard to sell a house on account of an infestation of spiders when your definition of \infestation\ " is one or two spiders < PROPMALE >." 
Well , I'm going to sleep well tonight . :D 
Like this copypasta I posted out of boredom and I'll tell you :\ 
1 . ) How we met . \ 
2 . ) My first impression of you . \ 
3 . ) What I like about you . \ 
4 . ) My favorite memory of you . 
I'm going be announcing for a Little League game tonight . And thus , I follow in the footsteps of < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > . Just , you know , instead of play-by-play announcing baseball games on national radio , I'll be introducing the players and coaches . Also , I won't go from here to acting and then on to being a corporate spokesman and then politics . So ... I guess I'm not really following in his footsteps . 
Was pretty good spending the entirety of my day with my brother . I don't see him all that often anymore ( usually just once a month ) , so to see him from around 11:30 am or so until 1:30 am was nice . 
I really need something to do . I haven't done anything so far for this break , so does anyone want to < PROPFEMALE > out ? I don't care if we usually never < PROPFEMALE > out , if you want to then just tell me and we can . 
I've had a pretty crap Spring Break so far , other than seeing my brother . :/ Will someone fix that , please ? I don't want to sit around all week . 
After I finish reading the news for the day and finish up my Bomb the Music Industry ! marathon , I'm finally going to watch the first Ong-Bak . A rather appropriate way to end this boring ass day , if I do say so , myself . :D 
Well , that was a first . Never thought I would see a Kung Fu movie in which the main character jumped out of a stack of flaming barrels with his legs on fire and roundhouse kick someone in the neck , then just casually walk over to a container of water and douse his legs off . 
My right eye is blood-shot on the left side and my left is the same , just only in the very bottom corner . What ... what does that mean ? o.O 
I'm going to write a book . What about ? Who the hell knows ; I know I certainly don't care , it's just going to be a book that will be completed at some point in life . Maybe . Possibly . I guess . 
If there's one thing I've learned from kung-fu movies , it's that you kick so much more ass when you're drunk , and according to Ong-Bak 2 apparently you become an awesome breakdancer too . 
Congress runs your daily life , \ 
They brainwash you into thinking it's freedom . \ 
We've had a war every twenty years , \ 
They make you think we really need ' em . 
was in a trailer and had to round up eight cats in four carriers when the storm hit , so stop bitching . :D 
That was quite honestly the worst night's sleep I've ever had . Woke up covered in sweat , my neck was stiff , my left elbow was throbbing from how many times I used it to roll over in the middle of the night , and my stomach felt and my mouth tasted like I had thrown up a couple of times . Now I've got to go take the permit test . Good thing , from what everyone I've ever asked has said , it's easy as piss . 
Dad's doing some networking work in Elizabethton , so I'm just sitting in the server room/security office on his laptop . I just finished reading the Congressional Progressive Caucus's proposed 2012 budget which would bring about a $50 billion surplus by 2021 , all the while 2 management employees watched security monitors behind me , making fun of people working on the floor of the factory . < PROPFEMALE > , everybody . 
Didn't have the time to get my permit today , but I have become convinced that Dad could win a congressional election if he were to run . No matter where we went today everyone talked to him like they had been best friends for years , and he even gave me a tour around the manufacturing area of a factory and no one cared that he and I weren't supposed to be there . They were just happy to see Dad . 
Fuck the DMV ! I had my birth certificate , my social security card , and a form from the school proving that I attended school , and they sent me home because I didn't have two fucking forms of identification that showed my current address . Stop having such a sore ass over 9/11 for fuck's sake , < PROPFEMALE > . LET ME GET MY GODDAMN PERMIT !!!! nfldashjklg 
Well , I applied at McDonald's today and Dad's going to talk to the manager tomorrow , which will ensure I get the job . :/ Worst of all , I put down that I wanted Saturdays off , but Dad's probably going to change that tomorrow when he talks to < PROPFEMALE > . He said that I won't make shit for money if I don't work all weekend , so for the rest of the school year and the first month and a half of next I won't have any free time . 
That was a great end to a shitty day . Thanks , everyone , for distracting me and allowing me to have a good time . Going back to the camp tomorrow . (: 
Haircut next Saturday so I have a higher < PROPMALE > of getting the job at McDonald's ( which I more than likely will once someone gets fired or quits ) , and at some point I need to invest in an actual razor rather than just using Dad's electric . 
People , it doesn't matter if Osama bin Laden is dead , okay ? Please shut up about it . Nothing is going to change because of his death . In fact , it will probably cause an increase in terrorist plots/actions against the US and its allies . You can talk about how it's a good thing that justice was finally served to such a vile man , but it probably wasn't . It was more than likely just a random drone attack that did him in . 
So ... thinking about running for Male Vice President . Doubtful I could win , but I'ma try . 
Well , I have all the supplies for making my campaign posters , now someone needs to help me make them . D: 
Why is it that I don't have a single friend that isn't hated by at least one of my other friends , save for very few people ? What's the point in holding grudges or hating in general ? What's the point in judging based off of the word of others ? Just makes me wonder who might hate me for whatever reason in this school/county of ours . 
Well , guess I got to go to this damn truancy meeting now . At least once it's over with I don't have to deal with this shit anymore . But two hours is insanely long for this bullshit . I was late to class 11 times in the course of three and a half nine-week periods , and only by a minute or so each time . Just because I don't have insurance and couldn't get a doctor's excuse for 5 absentee days , they scrutinize over it . 
Gonna go shave with an actual razor rather than an electric for the first time . MANHOOD ! >:D 
Who just got hacked ? 
Got my haircut today . This is the first time that I've gotten my haircut twice within less than 7 months in over 3 years . :/ I hate haircuts . 
Going to end my otherwise shitty day with a marathon of The Wire and some pudding . :D
