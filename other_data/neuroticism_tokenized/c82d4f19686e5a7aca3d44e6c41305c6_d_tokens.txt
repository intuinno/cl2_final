i've got to go out and finish my last minute shopping .... i'm so NOT in the christmas mood . 
Ridge High people --- what is going on ?!! I just read an article in the newspaper about an inappropriate movie ?! Am I so far out of the loop ? 
about to start wrapping presents ( < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > are out shopping ) , I'm feeling some shooting pains in my lower back -- wonder if that means anything ?!! It better not !! 
is watching football , rooting for the Vikings . < PROPFIRST > just made me look up info on the \Ice Bowl \"-- crazy !! " 
i'm up in the middle of the night because < PROPFIRST > is crying saying his leg hurts ??!! chocolate milk and curious < PROPFIRST > xmas special seem to be helping . 
we are off to drop < PROPFIRST > off at Grandma and Grandpa's , then off to the hospital . Everyone think positive , happy thoughts !!!!! 
Well , I finally got the OK to be discharged ( 8 o'clock at night ! ) , but since < PROPFIRST > has to stay in to stay under the lights ( jaundice ) I'm staying too . I haven't seen < PROPFIRST > since Thursday and it's killing me !!!! There is only so much bad TV I can watch , especially without a DVR ( I'm spoiled apparently ) . 
we were all discharged from the hospital yesterday , and i wish that i could say that today was spent relaxing and recuperating .... but no . we spent about 3 and 1/2 hours running around to pediatrician and lab for blood work . tomorrow we do nothing !! 
white , currently half on half off . 
Thanks for all of the birthday wishes !! I've had a great day -- Family ( and < PROPFEMALE > ) came over for lunch and we played some games , and we had my favorite cake from < PROPMALE > Ave bakery !! 
I have totally lost count of how many times < PROPFIRST > has peed on me ( and on the wall , on the changing table , on the bedspread ) . Why does it surprise me every time ?!! 
\Abel set out to meet this request but soon became aware of a mistake in the derivation . \""

is sad .... my father-in-law still has not accepted me as a friend !! It's been 2 weeks and I am still awaiting friendship confirmation !! What is up with that ?!! :) 
It could be hormones ... but I'm watching the < PROPFEMALE > Globes , and some of the speeches are making me cry ! I love < PROPFEMALE > Streep ! She is the best !

RIP JD Salinger- The Catcher in the Rye is where we got < PROPFIRST>'s middle name Holden . 
Did you ever have a song in your head , but you couldn't quite figure out what the song was ? I had this song on my I tunes ( before my old computer crashed and I lost everything ) . All I could remember was that it was off of a soundtrack and she mentioned potpourri and a museum . After MONTHS , I have finally found the song !!! Fallen for You off of High Fidelity soundtrack by < PROPFEMALE > Nicholls !!! 
where's the coffee ? 
< PROPFIRST > slept for 4 hours in a row last night !!! I feel like a new person !! 
Oh ! glass of wine ... how I've missed thee !! 
Geaux Saints !! 
I fell asleep at half time ... and I should have gone to bed . Because although it was a great game ... < PROPFIRST > had his own schedule , and I'm paying for the lack of sleep now with a feisty 2 yr old . 
is having a very challenging morning trying to keep a sneezing , coughing 2 and 1/2 yr old away from his baby brother !! 
watching news coverage for olympics ! 
Hey ! They're drinking \Heisler\ " beer on TV show Accidentally On Purpose . I want some ! " 
2 crying children -- lucky me !! 
OK , I spoke too soon last night , after < PROPFIRST > went to sleep , < PROPFIRST > went on to cry for about 3 hours straight . Then < PROPFIRST > woke up around 1 , and then again , I don't even know what time , but < PROPFIRST > got up for that one . Aghh !! I better not catch this same cold ! 
up with a sick baby -- the worst !! 
I took < PROPFIRST > to the Dr. on Sat am , the doc sent us to the ER , who then admitted him to Hunterdon Medical Ctr . He tested positive for RSV ( a kind of respiratory virus ) . Since he was showing some distress , and they couldn't get an IV in , they sent us to St. < PROPFIRST>'s in New Brunswick . 
< PROPFIRST > update : he is stable , they started him on some steroids , and we are hoping that he has already peaked , still in PICU until he doesn't need oxygen anymore . Thanks for all of the positive thoughts and prayers !! Keep ' em coming !! : ) 
< PROPFIRST > update : He's doing really well , off of oxygen , only a half order of steroids , we will move into the regular pediatric floor as soon as a bed opens up and doc says if he has a good night -- we go home tomorrow !! YaY !! 
Hey NJ when is the snow coming ? and what is the probability ? The doc wants us to stay another day :~( and I don't want to be stuck in a snow storm !!!! 
< PROPFIRST > update : We convinced the doc that we should go home instead of being stuck here in the snow . He is doing really well , mild wheezing on his exhalations , but otherwise he's basically back to normal . We got a nebulizer , so we can do his breathing treatments at home . Yay !!!!!!!! 
there's no place like home .... there's no place like home .... :~) 
< PROPFIRST > is getting a little stir crazy inside !! ( but I most certainly am not going outside right now !! ) 
Money spent on < PROPFIRST>'s snowsuit was money well spent !! 
< PROPFIRST > got a clean < PROPMALE > of health from pediatrician today !! He even has gained 5 oz since last week -- how is that possible ?!!

Some of these P & G commercials make me teary-eyed .....

5 hours of sleep in a row . Enough said . 
just made butternut squash/carrot soup -- surprisingly it tastes good !

why did the cookie go to the doctor ? 
so , I'm watching \Who do you think you are ? \ " and is it sad to notice that the narrator is the same one who did the \ " Alaska Experiment\ " ? Do I watch too much TV ? " 
I would like to nominate my son < PROPFIRST > for poster child for the terrible twos . Either that , or if there is anyone out there who is contemplating having another child , I will < PROPFEMALE > him out for the afternoon -- free of charge !! ( this will help you make up your mind !! ) 
just watched the movie Up .... no one told me that I was going to cry .... Great movie .

Today is the day that all of my half-started projects get done !!! ( how is that for optimism ?!! ) 
must ... get ... moving .... and get out of the house ! 
had to pack away some of < PROPFIRST>' clothes that he grew out of yesterday .... I'm sad :( He's growing up too fast !! Where did 4 months go ? 
< PROPFIRST > slept for almost 10 hours last night .... mommy did not . C'est la vie !! 
is getting ready to take < PROPFIRST > to his 4 month dr. appt . Is it sad that I've been excited for about a week , because I can't wait to find out his stats ?!! 
< PROPFIRST > weighs 16 lbs 4 oz--he's in the 90th % , my little chunky monkey ! ( his height is only in the 50th%) 
OK , < PROPFIRST > is at the sitter's , 3 cups of coffee , 2 pieces of chocolate = I'm ready to knock some items off of my to-do list . For accountability : take hardware off of railing , prime it and paint it . 
< PROPFIRST > might end up being a vegetarian .... every time I say this little piggie had a tofu burger ( instead of roast beef) -- he laughs . Wait ... maybe that means he's going to be a hard-core carnivore . 
Happy Mother's Day to all the moms out there !! 
a baby's giggle is just like a potato chip --- you can't just have one !! I'm addicted ! 
< PROPFIRST>'s goal today is to push me over the edge ... First he wanted the baseball shirt , then it was spiderman shirt . My solution ? He is currently wearing 3 shirts , 4 if you count the undershirt ..... 
husband has a bad headache , but after the day i've had ... i'm not so sympathetic ! 
my sister is OBSESSED with the Twilight books ... do I even dare pick one up ?!! 
It may be a fluke , and I hope that I'm not jinxing anything .... but < PROPFIRST > slept through the night -- 2 nights in a row !! ( from 8 till 7 yesterday and 8 till 6 today) !!!!! I LOVE sleep !!!! You don't appreciate it until you can't have as much of it as you want ( especially in a row !!!! ) !!!!! 
jinxed ! 
is in big trouble !! < PROPFIRST > is already moving across the floor ! ( kicking off with his feet when he is on his back ! ) 
how come when I'm working I feel like I have no free time .... but I'm not working and I still feel super busy .... what's up with that ?!! 
hello .... that was totally a goal !!! 
I'm up early ... I made an appointment for < PROPFIRST > to have a re-orientation at the gym since we just rejoined . And since it was for 5:30 am I promised him that I would wake up early with him to keep him company while he got ready . He reluctantly made it out the door on time , and I'm not sleepy enough to go back to sleep . I have the feeling as soon as a child wakes up I'll feel sleepy again ... 
\I'm fine with that\ " is the polite way of saying \ " whatever ! \"." 
let's go Flyers !!!!!! 
was inspired by the World cup to play soccer outside with < PROPFIRST > . He was the goal keeper and I made shots on goal ( while carrying around an 18 lb baby ( maybe even 19 lbs at this point ! )) Needless to say we were pretty evenly matched !! 
My husband noted that our cat , Mr. D ., is like Visa , he's everywhere you want to be . 
needs a nap !!!! 
is trying to sit here as quietly as possible , < PROPFIRST > is in the kitchen washing dishes/pots/pans , and I don't want to distract him in any way ! : ) 
I need to sand the trim in my bedroom to get it ready to paint . But ... what I really want to do is finish reading my book , Twilight . Yes , I decided to read it and it is pretty good . SO , if someone can come over and read it to me while I work , that would be great . I'll leave the side door open . Thanks . 
I am only allowed to finish reading my book if I go to the gym . See you later everyone !! 
watching Serenity with hubby . 
we're back from family reunion in < PROPFEMALE > . We had a lot of fun ... but it was a tiring night with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > at Aunt < PROPFIRST>'s!! Sooo glad to be home and to be able to sleep in my own bed ! 
I have 400 pages to go in Eclipse before I see the movie tomorrow . The race is on .... can I finish before 1:30 tomorrow ?!! 
watching Hot Tub Time Machine ...... 
Teamwork = getting the banister back up !! Thank you < PROPFEMALE > !!! You are the best project-doer in the world !!!!!!!!!! 
< PROPFIRST > says that < PROPFIRST>' favorite kind of music is Lady Goo-Goo-Ga-Ga . ( yeah , this is what I live with every day !! take pity on me :~) ) 
when roasting a small chicken , never use a glass pyrex dish . never . 
now that I'm done with the Twilight saga .... I have a large whole in my life . What will I do with all my free time ? Ponder how ordinary my life is ? Why don't I know any vampires ? 
is heading to the Ship Inn for dinner ..... 
< PROPFIRST > and I just finished watching Avatar .... I know we are a little slow . Was this movie a metaphor for something ?

I LOVE kettle corn .... just bought a big bag from Costco yesterday , and I'm almost done .... 
is up for the second day in a row at 3am . Maybe < PROPFIRST > is going through some kind of growth spurt ?! 
< PROPFIRST > and I watched I am Legend the other night and I can't stop thinking about it . It's freaking me out a bit . I feel like I should learn some basic skills in case I'm immune . Like how to re-wire my house and make it run on generators .... I need to learn that . 
trying to get to the park ..... 
nap time .... I'll need it considering I'm taking both boys to a baseball game tonight without < PROPFIRST > . ( Iron Pigs ) But at least mom and Aunt < PROPFEMALE > will be available to help out ! 
I am already too knowledgeable about comic book characters . 
it sounds like they are all asleep . < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > were having trouble settling down and I need to go to sleep now !! I'm a little burnt from our yard sale today . ( literally and figuratively ) 
I've been up since 4:30 , which means that I had 4 and a half hours of sleep . < PROPFEMALE > Ziminski -you have been such a trooper for the last few days !! Thank you sooooo much !! I owe you one pink bathroom !!

Just got my new phone ! 
Give me back my helmet ! 
we listed our house last night .... everyone think happy , positive thoughts so we can sell our house before I go back to school in February !!! 
we are off to the park , so I can do some running before I attempt to run a 5K on Sunday with only 5 days of training . What ... do I think that I'm still 25 ? 
DONE !! I was able to clean/clear the house in order for photographer to take pics for real estate brochure , all with a crying/teething baby on my hip . 
Race update : I finished !!! without walking !!! My first 5K in like 5-6 years , and I survived !! I finished under 40 minutes , which I really thought it would be like 45 , so I'm happy . I also had my sis and her family , and my husband and kids waiting for me -- so it was great !! 
At the park . 2bees just learned what death by chocolate means . They landed in our nutella . 
I just got our new modem .... almost a week without a real computer .... I was really productive .... hmmmmmm .

is up early with < PROPFIRST > , then a shower , then proctoring the SATs . The good thing about SATs on maternity leave is I get to read a magazine , not grade papers ! :~) 
< PROPFIRST > , when you looked , were your eyes open ? 
I was going to go to bed ... and then I started listening to Nine Inch Nails ( I finally downloaded Pretty Hate Machine onto my IPod ) .... and now I just want to keep listening .... 
I'm heading to Ridge to pick up some recommendation info .... Hopefully I will get to see some much-missed teacher friends !! ( and get some scoop ! ) 
This October has 5 Fridays , 5 Saturdays and 5 Sundays , all in one month . It happens once in 823 years . 
Mommy needs a glass of wine tonight . No exceptions . 
Let's hope that today is a better day !!

is now frying catfish . Maybe I should have stayed in Louisiana ?!! 
I think ( fingers crossed ) < PROPFIRST > has finally fallen asleep . It's been a tough day for babies . ( especially those who are teething ) 
A teacher is somewhere tonight preparing lessons to teach your children while you are watching TV . In the minute it takes you to read this , teachers all over the country are not only saving lives , but they are also sacrificing their own time for your child's literacy , prosperity , ...... and future . It's Teacher Appreciation Week . Re-post if you are a teacher , love a teacher , or appreciate our teachers ! 
just finished making sugar cookies for < PROPFIRST>'s class for tomorrow . My sister laughed at me because I am always so last minute . I finished before midnight , so the joke is on her !! :~) 
Little < PROPFIRST > is on the move ... and he doesn't care that he hasn't let me sleep for the past week . He is in < PROPFIRST>'s room going through the toy box . 
just made grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup !! 
why do I work best with a looming deadline and time pressure ?!! 
is getting ready for my anniversary weekend !! Today is < PROPFIRST > and my 5th year anniversary ! Oh how time flies ! 
Score one for advertising .... < PROPFIRST > is eating frosted mini-wheats , because he loves the commercial and kept asking me to buy them . 
the best thing about our weekend away .... no one interrupted our conversations !!!!!!!!! 
\Our responsibility to all those who serve goes far beyond honoring or thanking them . Our responsibility to those who serve is doing everything we humanly can to make sure they live to be veterans . \ " < PROPMALE > Janis-Dillon " 
Ok , < PROPFIRST > was just galloping around the room , holding his private area , saying : \Giddy up penis\ " . How can I explain to him that isn't really appropriate ?!! " 
I am seriously considering getting a dog . If I step on one more cheerio or kix I'm going to go ballistic !! 
I knew that we should have named him < PROPFIRST > Redding !! He loves the Fa-Fa-Fa song !! 
holy crap , is next week really Thanksgiving ?!! I signed up to run the Turkey Trot in Flemington ( I finally did it < PROPFEMALE > ) and I've run about 3 times since the last 5K I did . So .... I have the feeling that I'm in trouble .

I'm living in a frat house .

we just got our new produce delivery , so I looked up a recipe for brussels sprouts . I have a feeling that the < PROPFEMALE > Deen recipe with bacon will somehow negate the healthiness of the sprouts , but I'm going to try it .
