What u know about \Homegirls & Hand grenades\ " & u can't tell me about the original \ " Dear Mama\ " ?? The most reputable rap artist that was a scholar & poet was best defined in my mind as that ... Never judge a book by its cover even doctor's can make the wrong diagnosis sometimes ...

He recited a < PROPFEMALE > verbatim & she was more than impressed , this book was concerning the Women's Rights Movement only a few copies so how did he know so much about sooo much ? it shouldn't be hard 2 determine who this phenomenial individual was that left us with profound thoughts & images whenever we hear or speak his name or his legendary music .. 
& since the movement we have overcome .. While 62% are graduates only 38% of men follow behind in college .. & yes I said behind cause we are in the lead ... Its a scientific fact we can access both sides of our cerebral cortex simultaneously so we do have the greatest gifts known 2 man ..

The unbidden bible reveals that 666 is knowable . Rev 13:18 The beast is a man but what man ? The sibylline oracles indicate that Jesus = 888
