I need another day off lol 
is sooooooo tired lol but fortunately it's the continuous working kind and not the bored kind . 
so willing for tomorrow to come lol ( day off ) however , I also can't wait to start working again either ... 
enjoying my two days off 
back at home 
Could people from Mars Hill read my note \Hey\ " ? that would make me feel better ... " 
... ever feel so tired that you could just die but your brain says \in your dreams\ " and stays active ? " 
feeling rather well right now =) 
I am convinced that the five extra commandments that < PROPMALE > dropped contained \Thou shalt not have Spanish as a language ; thou shalt not ever speak of such blasphemy ; thou shalt forget all affiliation with the personification of evil ; thou shalt speak English this year onward for it must be a universal language ; thou shalt be grateful that these commandment tell you to do no Spanish . \"" 
I can say that I'm pretty happy right now lol 
i can say i'm thinking too much 
Facebook sucks right now 
im confused 
Ok ... just called apple support and they fixed everything , YAY !!!! 
I wish I could think of better things to say to people when the moment presents itself and not after 
About to head home on Fall Break ! finally lol 
I'm kind of happy that I just put two and two together to connect the Episcopal Church with the Church of England lol awesome 
Just watched an Iron Maiden Concert and am completely pumped up !!!!!!! :D 
I am convinced that the bible also states that those who hate math shall not be forced by any means to take it as a class 
Oh how the devilry of math and spanish seem ever so close to taking over the world , is anyone going to stop the atrocities ? Is there a champion that will just say no to these horrendous acts of < PROPFIRST > and influencers ? 
Does life give flowers or petals ? 
Thanks Everybody !!!! 
over one foot of snow !!!! in < PROPMALE > Mount of all places ! God loves me lol maybe he/she has forgiven dad and lifted his curse 
Just woke up to check on conversations i fell asllep on and now going back to bed 
ah the feeling of boredom , how you haunt me so ! 
just saw the match ups for the 2011 Rugby World Cup !!!! getting very excited ! 
Just suffered my first extremely vivid dream in a very long time = I 
When you < PROPFEMALE > the Bible , Satan gets a headache . When you open it , he collapses . When he sees you reading it , he faints . When he sees you living it , he flees . And just when you're about to re-post this , he'll try to discourage you . Copy and re-post if you can ... Any takers ? 
preparing for the big leave 
At the hill and hungry 
feeling a bit off
