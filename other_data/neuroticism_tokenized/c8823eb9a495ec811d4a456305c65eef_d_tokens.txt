Happy New Year . 

So ... That pale ale that I thought was completely un-redeemable has turned one year old - and is now an incredible , oaky brown ale with hints of apple ... Just goes to show that age can cure nearly any brew of its failings .

Should really stop being surprised by the fact that the Republican Party is completely out of touch with reality . 
The sun beams down on a brand new day/No more welfare tax to pay/Unsightly slums gone up in flashing light/Jobless millions whisked away/At last we have more room to play/All systems go to kill the poor tonight

Despises his brothers . 
Can't sleep ... 
Has yet to see a cactus , and is quite offended by this fact . 
Well , even if it is one of the more ... Melodramatic talking heads , at least someone is calling the Blue Dogs what they really are ... Montana friends , you might as well just vote for a Republican next Senatorial election : Baucus is practically one .... 
Opposes insurer-oriented healthcare , and is tired of the crooks and liars on the right who want to sell us the poison pill of unregulated murder-by-spreadsheet . Fight back !! 
is so stumped by the stupid of the Republican Party that he does not know what to say ... 
At the end of the day : WE won the election , WE were prooven factually right again and again , WE stood by the values of this nation while the lunatic fringe violated them as they saw fit , so WHY are the lunatics being allowed to rule ?

HRC supporters , you were right , I was wrong . I'm sorry . 
No mandate without public option . 
=( 
It occurs to me that < PROPFIRST > Bush's great failure was that he did not listen to the internet . He should have known that the yellowcake was a lie . 
SUSA : 77% of Americans support public option . So much for the \Average Joe\ " teabaggers . "

I will not buy this record , it is scratched . 
< PROPFIRST > Bragg and an IPA on a cool summer night . Damn near perfect ... 
Is making chili . Also , will be in Tacoma Wednesday and Saturday .

Huh ... Well , it was ... interesting . Not bad , but I can't feel my nose ... 
Has to write awkward emails ... =( 
There will be feasting , and dancing/In Jerusalem next year

Has anybody here/Seen my old friend < PROPMALE > . 
< PROPMALE > Beck may actually be even MORE crazy than he has appeared in the past to be . 
Reformers outnumbered Teabaggers 2 to 1 at < PROPFIRST > Inslee's town-hall today . I managed to avoid shouting anything too rude at the < PROPFIRST > Beck fans . 
New idea : Neo-Romantic , Progressive Rock Band : < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , and Chandler . 
Sigh ... I hope everyone enjoys classes tomorrow . I'm missing school at this point . 
God dammit . The bigots got Ref . 71 on the ballot . 
Do you ever feel like you're sitting watching a disaster unfold too slowly to fully grasp its scale ? 
And I know , I'm gonna miss this guitar . 
Narcoleptic Poe says : suddenly , there came a napping . 
There's something deeply disturbing about the fact that a psychopath like < PROPFIRST > Beck has one viewer , let alone a million . 
Wonders why he bothers to study authoritarianism , communism , and totalitarianism when half of < PROPFEMALE>'s political leaders lie through their damned teeth about what those things consist of . It's both infuriating and incredibly depressing . 
Lets go sounders ... 
Sounders win !!! 
\Socialism . \ " You keep using that word . I do not think it means what you think it means . " 
I'm genuinely puzzled by these obnoxious Acai ads . They seem to have begun engaging in reverse psychology . 
Is going out to coach goalkeepers this afternoon . I miss playing soccer . Who's up for an intermural soccer team when I get back in the Spring , UPSers ? 
While a new iPhone is state of the < PROPMALE > , Soviet Realism is the < PROPMALE > of the state . 
I am shocked and horrified by the accusations on the internet about < PROPMALE > Beck ! The things that < PROPMALE > n Beck 1990 has said ... What horrible accusations ! 
No one should die because they cannot afford healthcare . No one should go broke because they get sick , and no one should be tied to a job because of pre-existing condition . If you agree , please post this as your status for the rest of the day . 
58% of Americans are for the public option as of today . Don't let the crazies own the debate . 
< PROPFIRST > Harwood : \If people don't want their kids exposed to the president telling them to work hard at their studies and stay in school they are just stupid . Frankly it makes me worry that they are too stupid to be raising kids \"" 
I'm seriously fucking sick of the Republican Party . When does the crazy end ?

Is attempting to flatten his computer . May be incommunicado for a few days . 
Is leaving the US for the next 14 weeks . I'll still be around on the interwebs , but I fly out in 8 hours ... I hate flying !! 
Traveling . Will post an update when I hit NYC ... If I remember . 
Is in London . Sorry I couldn't get word out sooner , my computer is being difficult . Hope you all are doing well . I'm going to go find water . 
Loves London . It's a hell of a town . The streets make less sense than < PROPFIRST > Beck . 
Is going to the Globe theater tonight . Mmmmmm , Shakespeare ! 
Sounders beat United ... Phew , still in the running for the playoffs . 
Not a fun lecture . Felt like a target . 
Has computer and Skype . Tell him your skype address if you want to speak with him while he is in parts unknown . 
Ne moi iantus gnaton uorega/Iantus drucocunos uoregon/Cante < PROPFEMALE > in medie cete . 
WTF UPS : Banning nerf weaponry is a totally < PROPMALE > move . Someone should restart ultimate challenge as a protest . 
Someone want to go bitch to the President during Coffee hours for me ? The new weapons and violence policies have some real issues in them . 
Just realized that he was arguing about pokemon with < PROPMALE > while listening to < PROPMALE > Astley ... =( 
found the guitar in the AHA basement and is quite happy , although he has discovered that his calluses are nearly completely gone , and is forming a blister on his first fiinger . Worth it for a guitar . Totally worth it . 
Fuck you , good advice ! Stop being so god damned right ! 
Met a homeless man named < PROPFIRST > while leaving a take-away place where he discussed the way Muslims are treated in the US . Sometimes God just makes the extra effort to punch you in the balls and run away . 
Is sick ... Or something ... Not fun . 
Sounders Season tickets are as low as $300 for the whole damn season ... If only I could make every game . 
Time to primary Baucus , < PROPMALE > , Carper , < PROPMALE > , and < PROPMALE > . No public option , no votes . 
Republican Health Care Plan : 1 . Don't get sick . 2 . And if you do .... 3 . DIE QUICKLY . Pass it on . 
When I am dead/Lay me in a mound/Raise a stone for all to see/Runes carved to my memory . 
Cannot find beef or cheese for chili . What a frustrating afternoon ... 
Guinness Foreign Extra : A Little TOO bitter ... O.o 
There'll always be a happy hour/For those with money , jobs , and power/They'll never realize the hurt/They cause to men they treat like dirt 
Is sick and thus missed class . Staying out until midnight at the Globe in the drizzle and coldish air probably didn't do me any good ... 
3 of 4 papers done with a week remaining . Now if only my sinuses would hurt less . 
Watching Republican heads explode = AWESOME . Keep on looking bitter and childish , freepers ! 
Limbaugh : The Right wing is on the side of the Taliban ... I won't argue . Now , Health Care . Tempest in a teapot , children . 
Sweet Moderation/Heart of this nation/Desert us not/We are between the wars . 
May go see < PROPFEMALE > Sac Vs . Pip on the weekend . 
Just realized a great irony : he could get communion at any Church of England Church while many of his legitimately Christian classmates cannot . Heh . 
So ... My faith in humanity and how < PROPFEMALE>'s right wing appears to be waging a war on it . 
Loves Google Books and Google Scholar . They turn \Not enough info\ " to \ " glutted with info\ " for any research project . " 
Looked back at his Research Paper for PG 250 and laughed derisively at his conclusion ... Naive , to say the least . 
Almost just wants to say fuck health reform , let's just take away anti-trust protection from the Health Insurance Con-Men and < PROPFEMALE > the motherfuckers out of existence . 
Mistook a dishwasher for a duck ... 
One last presentation and then I need to rest . I dislike written tests , my wrist feels like someone replaced it with a cement block . 
Poultry . That will be all . 
Oh frabjuous day ! 
Has the spleen of 10 tigers ! 
Can't write a song to save his life , right now . Bah ... Creativity , consistency would be nice ... 
Sounders qualify for playoffs ! Yay ! And I get 3 hours of sleep . -_- . 
Rasmussen may well be the worst pollster ever . I wonder whether they purposefully sample incorrectly . 
Is praying to the schedule gods that he gets the schedule he wants for next semester . It would kick so much ass !!! 
Ever get the feeling you've been cheated ? 
Okay guys , if you weren't planning on voting in the upcoming WA election , you need to change your plans . Referendum 71 was put on the ballot by right wing bigots to deny gay partners the ability to even get civil unions . Even though the people who put the referendum on the ballot were scumbags , a vote to APPROVE the < PROPMALE > is a vote to keep equality , so vote YES on Referendum 71 . We can't let the bigots win . 
I am a timebomb/A tiickin tickin tickin time bomb . 
Going to Edinburgh in the morning . Yay ! 
Does anyone ( I suppose I should probably limit that to < PROPFIRST > , Zach , and < PROPMALE > , now that I think about it ) know when the performer's list for PaganFest 2009 was released ? I don't want to miss it this year . 
Is illiterate ? 
You know you're a synesthesiac when : It's too loud , so you turn off the lights . 
My heart beats left . 
Is in Edinburgh . Tired and not feeling touristy ... 
Wants to be < PROPMALE > Greyson when he grows up . ( If he grows up , which seems rather unlikely , all things considered ) 
Went to Loch Ness today . Had a cool bus driver . Has dubbed < PROPFIRST > Smith his \Dark Lord of Capitalism \"." 
Back from Edinburgh . Tired . 
Mead is good . 
Has decided he is an Arsenal fan . Yay ? 
4 pool zerging !!! 
Fuck < PROPFIRST > Lieberman . Nearly as bad as the Republicans . Can it be dropping this bipartisan nonsense now ? 
Is gonna make cheese when he gets home . 
Is drowning out the emotionally stilted television as best he can . 
Let's go Sounders FC ! 
So , you know what figures ? Every time < PROPFIRST > Bragg is in Seattle , I miss his shows , and now that I'm in London ( where he lives ) he has no shows in London while I'm here . I'm getting a little bitter about this . 
Cambridge hates me ... 
Paper ... Ugh ... 16% done .... 
Done with the first draft of the paper ... Only took an hour longer than it should have . 
New Epica album = awesome 
We're the first ones to starve , we're the first ones to die/ The first ones in line for that pie-in-the-sky/ And we're always the last when the cream is shared out/ For the worker is working when the fat cat's about 
Stupidly is taking part in Nanowrimo ... 
1700 words down , 48300 left to go . 
Really finds it hilarious that the Republicans are so indignant . They're the ones who put themselves where they are . If they lived in the real world , none of this would have ever happened . 
I can see you make the music/'cause you < PROPFEMALE > a guitar/But Gods help the Troubadour/Who tries to be a bard 
Alestorm , Dark Tranquility , Epica , Eluvietie , and Sonata Arctica ... My evening is quite good , thanks . 
Starting from scratch : Non-fiction style ! 
Old Mr. < PROPMALE > walked by here today/After 40 years of toil he just up and walked away 
71 Approved .... Good . 
Never had to knock on wood/And I'm glad I haven't yet/Because I'm sure it isn't good/That's the impression that I get ! 
OMG DRAGON AGE !!!!! SOOOOOOOO AWESOME . 
Has written a < PROPFEMALE > on two lines of Shakespeare . O.o 
Which is the better band name : Generation of Vipers or < PROPMALE > Brothers Riot ? 
Wonders how the Republicans can tell the lies they are telling with a straight face . 
Beat < PROPMALE > in his first legitimate game of Starcraft . Over-pool to Mutakill ... Fun stuffs . 
And I'm proud to be a Republican/Where at least I know I'm free/And if those poor sods in my district die/Well it least it isn't me . 
booooooooooooooooored 
Really traumatizing encounter in S Harrow tonight ... 
Cmon you sounders ... A goal would be really nice , right about now . 
< PROPMALE > wins . Sad . 
Registered . Thiis is goood . 
It's a TROLL ! 
Is a terrible , horrible person . 
Obama's Afghanistan choice is probably the right one . 
Working on < PROPFIRST>'s Paper . Not making good progress ... Can't start on the history paper until my books get here . 
I was born with a silver revolver in my mouth/Cash and < PROPFEMALE > in the suburbs while the world's heading south 
Where have all the flowers gone ? RIP < PROPFIRST > . Just found out . 
< PROPMALE > NYE ON THE < PROPFEMALE > MADDOW SHOW ! SOOO BADASS . 
Booooooooooooooooooooooooooored . 
SEEEEEEAAAAAAAAKIIIIIIINGGG 
Just read an interesting argument that Japan's lost decade was actually an example of what a well managed recession should look like ... 
LA v Real Salt Lake ? What a crap playoff ... 
DT and Corn Flakes ... Good morning , world . 
< PROPFEMALE > Palin's new book is out , guys ! I'm told that it's an absolute < PROPFEMALE > turner . Quite possibly a nominee for best fiction book of the year . Also . 
Blood runs thicker , oh we're as thick of thieves you know/If it's important to you , it's important me/I try to make you see , but you don't want to know/What became of the likely lads ? 
' 80s singer has a warning for modern Britain : I thought of you when they closed down the school/ And the hospital too/Did they think that you were better ? /They were wrong 
A pall on truth and reason/It feels like hunting season . 
In Stratford-Upon-Avon , back tomorrow . 
Republicans : Reign in your own , please . Your fringe is getting out of control again , and they're talking violent again . 
DAMN YOU INFERNAL BEEPING !!!! STOOOOP !!!! 
thinks the American people deserve a debate -- and a vote -- on the health care reform plan that has now been worked on for almost a year . I RESPECT THE RIGHT OF ANY SENATOR TO VOTE AGAINST HEALTH CARE REFORM , BUT I REJECT ANY ATTEMPT BY A MINORITY OF SENATORS TO BLOCK THE ENTIRE SENATE FROM VOTING . If you agree , please post this as your status for the rest of the day ! 
The British police are apparently incompetent . 
So ... Wingnuts : go read the rest of that < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > quote you like so much ... It's all bullshit ( manure , technically ) . Heh . 
Watching Senate debate . Republicans predictably wrong on everything . Brownback typically idiotic . 
Focus ... Focus ... Bah . Must . Write . Paper . 
When that I was but a little < PROPFEMALE > boy/With a Hey , Ho , the wind and the rain/A foolish thing was but a toy/For the rain it raineth every day . 
Another unfamiliar ceiling ... 
Real Salt Lake are US Champions ? That's just STUPID ... 
BAAAAAWWWWWWW !!!! I don't want to work all day , I just want to run and play !!!!! 
In sports car heaven where we set our scene/The land of Mary-Jane and cheap mescaline/Well we're never making nothing , but no one really cares/In the land of easy money and the land of vacant stares 
< PROPMALE > , landrieu , < PROPMALE > , and Lieberman : Get in line . If you don't , we will primary you , and we will encourage progressives to not come out and vote for you or give you money . 
Memorized a ( short ) set of lines from Shakespeare for no reason ... That doesn't make me weird , does it ? 
We write lyrics and get in fights ! 
I never made the first team/I just made the first team laugh 
Occasionally considers going back to obnoxious street theatre and protest - at least then you don't have to pretend Conservatives aren't liars ... The downside is being crazy , but it seems like the right gets away with it , so why shouldn't we ? 
So ... Study abroad people : Has anyone ELSE received their housing info for next semester ? I'm still homeless , as far as I can tell ... 
One in Ten Goes Mad - One in Ten Cracks Up . Be Reasonable , Demand the Impossible . 
One in Ten Goes Mad - One in Five Cracks Up . Be Reasonable , Demand the Impossible . 
The President has chosen the right path on Afghanistan . The far left will bitch and moan that war is bad and stuff , and the far right will be stupid and foam at its mouth about whatever it can contrive to bitch about . Ah well ... 
And the temper-tantrums start on the left ... WAR IS BAD AND STUFF , GUYS !!!! 
Is there something wrong with these songs ? /Maybe there's something wrong with the audience . /Manipulation in rock music . Fucking Nausea . 
Horrible fucking day . Fuck Transport for London . 
I was 21 years when I wrote this song/I'm 22 now , but I won't be for long/People ask me when will you grow up to be a man/But the girls I loved in school are already pushing prams 
Well fuck ... We < PROPFIRST > England ... 
So , a little piece of cosmic irony - the store that was once < PROPMALE > McClaren and < PROPFEMALE > Westwood's ' Sex ' ( 430 Kings Rd . < PROPFEMALE > , London - Now Westwood's ' World's End ' ) is right next to the < PROPFEMALE > Conservative's Club ... 
Gets in trouble for being a member of the \peace through superior firepower\ " club again ... " 
Last paper nearly done ... I've got way too much content on this paper ... 
Give away $40 guitar lessons out of the goodness of his heart ... Capitalism hates me . 
O.o ... o.O ... O.O 
Is on another System of a Down kick ... 
Has added < PROPFIRST > Cohen to his \punch on sight\ " list . Stupid fucker . " 
Must find the will to finish needed work ... Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck 
And THIS is why I sometimes think Democracy is bullshit - rule by idiots . Good job , Conservatives , you've insured the needless deaths of 40,000 Americans a year for years to come . I hope that you are god damned proud . Monsters . 
Done with finals ... Home soon . 
Flying soon . I hate flying ... Pay off or blackmail your respective deity to assure my safety , eh ? 
Home . I'll be in contact after I hibernate . 
So ... I have badass new guitar that I can't touch until the 25th ... My mother is pure evil ... =( 
Okay - We've played nice and tried to play the democracy game . It failed . Now , its time to remind them what they are afraid of - when does the riot start ? 
Night in Tacoma - Coming back again . 
So .... Some culinary experiments end badly - My attempt to recreate the Donner at home is such an experiment ... Oh Ham Donner ... I should have known you were a bad idea from the start . 
tomorrow : solstice and mead-making . Mead should be ready by the time I'm 21 . 
Mead is racked - Starting on Cyser in a bit . Both will be done in a few months . >.< 
Joyous Yule - - Keeping vigil for the sun . Blessed be . 
Has campus housing : Trimble 111B . Will find out more when cascade gets updated . If only the school was as good about telling me what my grades were as it is at telling me where I'll live . 
Has been outsmarted by < PROPFIRST > Sanders ... Alright , I'll go back on my word then - the Senate < PROPMALE > is much better than I had imagined , and I have egg on my face . Well played , Senator Sanders .... Feck ... 
giving the wii fit balance board a personality was a mistake . It's a condescending asshole . 
So ... Why is it that the best song ( from a technical perspective ) I've written in the last year is one I no longer agree with ? How is this fair ? 
Out of curiousity - How the hell can a course on Intellectual Property not have Dr. L Lessig on its book list ? 
Arkona and Eluveitie on Paganfest 2010 Europe . No word yet on the USA tour , but if we get Alestorm and Tyr with those two , It'll kick some serious fucking ass . 
Suddenly ... I miss London . 
Lying in wait for the fat old stalinist and his eco-terrorist buddies . Just you wait , you trespassing pinko , this christmas'll be your last ! /The < PROPFIRST > Beck 
Must is now fermenting nicely - I have no idea why we didn't think that the cold was the issue . Happy Christmas everyone - hope you make off with some good loot . 
Okay - So , in case you were wondering , there's a lot of sugar in Mead Must ( I have no idea WHY you would be wondering - but if you were , wonder no longer ) . In the 24 hours since we corrected our < PROPMALE > mead-fail , we now have so much fermentation going on that the Cyser is trying its damndest to escape its container , and the mead is likely to follow its example in the next 24 hours . Yay ! 
The Obama wants to eat your pancreas in front of your children . Why you wanna kill me ? 
Seyyed < PROPFIRST > Mousavi dead on Asura . The Iranian regime could not have fucked up more if it had been trying . 
O.o I think the reason I still read the Naruto manga is because it makes me look comparatively rational . 
always had the feeling I could never be the villain/'cuz the villain in the films is always back-lit . 
K ... So ... Um , the Republicans ... Uh ... Look guys - Terrorism is my area of academic focus - this was not a systemic failure . Really , this is practically good news . It shows < PROPMALE > Quaeda has a lower capacity than ever before ( they NEVER deliver only one attack , because they know their bombs fail ) , and we know what the new bomb technology they are using is . 
For my fellow mead enthusiasts , I've been trying a new one : Honeymoon Nectar from Mountain Meadows Mead . It's an interesting sweet mead ( still highly alcoholic at 12% ABV ) with hints of nutmeg and cinnamon . Very good for a cold winter's night . Overall , I give it an 8/10 . A little unsubtle , and cloyingly sweet , but nevertheless enjoyable . 
Finished the Altheus Dossier to the point where he could post it on the wave . If you would like to read through it and are not in the game , simply post your email here and I will add you to the Wave . 
Okay , seriously ... I want my grades , UPS . 
Kirsty MacColl , Teriyaki , and Orange Soda .... Am I retro enough yet ? 
Racking Mead and Cyser today - secondary hasn't quite started yet , but if we don't do it now , it'll be a while until we do . 
3.92 =/ 
Putting the Romance back in Necromancy ? 
Apparently the Teabaggers are holding their convention at the < PROPMALE > hotel in Nashville Tennessee . This begs an important question : can they really be this clueless , or is there some prankster in the upper echelons of Teabagger organizers who is having far , far too much fun at his compatriots expense ? 
Tracking the Prop 8 trial , really hope that the SCoTUS rules to allow it to be televised - this is a big deal , and denying the public the right to see what goes on at trial is unjustifiable . 
Seattle on the FIFA WCup short list !!! Sweet . 
And the SCoTUS incorrectly rules on cameras in the Prop 8 courtroom . Frustrating and unnecessary - its not like it isn't being liveblogged ANYWAY . 
Is mildly concerned at why anyone would search ' why is there a dead pakistani man on my couch ? ' on Google ... Is this a common occurance ? 
at ups . tired . 
K - Life is back in order . Pretty , it aint , but I have all my stuff in the dorm room , and I can now use it for living . One step at a time . 
New words for the day : Absquatulate , ineluctable , cortege , and suzerainty . Who knew a course on terrorism would help me prepare for the GREs ? 
At the height of the conflict , British security forces totalled nearly 40000 men , arrayed against a hard core of fewer than 400 active terrorists , backed up by some 750 \auxiliaries \"." 
Early Zoroastrianism is soooooooo cool . 
Well ... Healthcare reform is dead - well done Massachusetts , you just fucked us all . It's really pathetic that a Republican was given < PROPMALE > Kennedy's seat . Ah well , all that time I thought Americans were getting less retarded , I was wrong . The only comfort I can take is that the rest of the world is just as stupid . 
happiness is just a chant away . 
Back from dancing - Who knew that Jewish wedding dances were a good workout ? 
Computer is dead - < PROPFEMALE > sigh ... 
So ... Who is interested in seeing if we can create a homebrewing club on campus ? ( my bet is no , but it would be fun ! ) 
Computer again . Phew . 
What do < PROPMALE > Derrida and Grandmaster Flash have in common ? More than I realized , apparently . 
May be a bad person for not accepting his mortar board invite . 
So Juliet/Just three more words/I'll write them in the dew/That presses at the window/Where I've written : I love you . 
This homework is ... Asinine ... 
IMPORTANT : If you are interested in having Arabic offered on campus next semester ( not as a full credit , probably - but the point is having access to that education ) in some form , please contact me . If you have friends who are interested in having Arabic offered on campus next semester , please have them contact me . 
The best ever death metal band out of Denton/will in time both outpace and outlive you ! 
Something Something Dark side ... 
And I come back to Trimble to experience the exquisite stench of weed ... How ... Delightful . 
Some change is bad change ... Like this one - horizontal constraint is bad graphic design , facebook ... 
In the end it took me a dictionary/To find out the meaning of unrequited .. 
If I was feeling really obnoxious , I'd make a pop-punk band named MUx/Px . 
Fact : When you buy an iTunes song , 9% of the revenue goes to a credit card company . 8% of it goes to the artist . Master Card : Some things are priceless , other things can be mercilessly monetized by vulture capitalists . 
Does anyone know a good free sampling program ? 
Just single-handedly hauled 4 crates of Mountain Dew into Trimble at once ... That was dumb ... 
Apparently the first thing to go in non-chemical marijuana addiction is consideration - I can't leave my god-damned room without being inundated by the stench of cat-ass . 
That was quite possibly the most trippy dream I have ever had ... 
New song ( for the teabaggers ): Mad as Hell - \'Cuz I'm mad as hell/And I'm not gonna take/My medicine anymore ! \"" 
Facebook : look , change is fine , but when change breaks your back-end code , you're doing it wrong . 
Found out that Disney tunes make for pretty damn good symphonic death metal tonight ... Destroyed my vocal chords providing proof of concept - but its a small sacrifice . 
If my three chord rock song has five different key changes in it , do I get to pretend its a 15 chord rock song ? 
I'm very disappointed in you , Boxbot . 
So ... I have this incredible setting for a webcomic ... I just can't draw ... Or stick with a project . 
No matter how factually accurate you may be , if you have been impeached from office for involvement in a high-priced prostitution ring , you probably ought to avoid using the phrase \the new hotness\ " . Just saying . " 
Why the fuck would you assign the National Review's favorite racist dipshit for class reading ? It's not like his opinion is worth the toilet paper necessary to collect it all ! 
Homework ... I should finish that . Five more hours of work - here I come ! ( also , maybe breakfast is a good idea ) 
The greatest betrayal of youth is the repetition of the lie that one can do anything - when one is lucky to accomplish anything at all . Banal necessities must constantly outweigh competing for even a minute of Warhol's fifteen . Misbehavior is now the only means of having any real impact on the world . Cheat , steal , lie , and destroy if you want to mean something . Heroes are for storybooks , and n o-o ne reads any more . 
For some reason , Bartell's doesn't like it when I ask for refills on eight medicines ... >.< 
Wrote a Sestina ! 
So ... Good lottery number ... And stupid fucking denial of appeal . I think I might just scream . 
So ... UPS gets the asshat award for the day . Good job , Academics Standards Committee , you've demonstrated that you posses the IQ of a severely retarded chipmunk . Love , < PROPFIRST > . 
The library never fails to impress me . Seriously . I found a book on Nihilism and Russian Politics . I thought I was < PROPFIRST > on the Narodnaya Volya's history . 
Holy shit - the cops busted my high school again - safe suburban home , lulz . 
Boldrin and Levine argue that copyright helped to kill the < PROPFEMALE > age classical music - interesting ... 
Everything but my 10 < PROPFEMALE > paper is done for next week ... Tomorrow - the 10 < PROPFEMALE > r . 
Done , just in time for dinner . 
Focus ... Focus ... Must focus ... O.o 
So ... Again , ASUPS doesn't let me vote . Ah well . At least I don't have to feel torn over who I'm voting for . 
Sick . 
My ongoing experience in Intellectual Property has inspired me to begin drawing a web-comic in class ... Mostly based off of the things the teacher says . 
So give me/A little bit of that old time religion/The kind that you put down in shots/And we'll drink a toast , to our better decisions/Ignoring the 8 by 4 plots ! /Old time Religion/You never let me down/When times they grew too tough for me/My sorrows they were drowned/Old time religion/I'm supplicant in praise/So drink a toast to the bankers/And to the end of days ! 
The thing about Parliamentary elections is you never know what sort of party you will get - it's a grab bag . Sometimes its the Christian Democratic Union and sometimes its the Islamic Cheerleader's Workers Party . Just one more reason for Proportional Representation . 
Bored . 
Didn't read O.J. Yoo's \How I did it\ " for Terrorism on Thursday . Will continue not to do so . " 
6 in the morning ... I haven't missed you . 
Wishes FifPro would keep us updated on the CBA stuffs . I want to know if I should get tickets to any Sounders games this season . 
And the rent-seeking mob of our tapering lifelines sings deficit and despair/So the whole room sang Ave < PROPFIRST > , ' cuz all we got left now is prayer . 
I may be crazy - but I can't tell the difference between the < PROPFEMALE > of \Danny Boy\ " and the < PROPFEMALE > of \ " Jerusalem \"" 
Okay , for < PROPMALE > , I am writing a Steampunk neo-classist piece for crosscurrents . 
Trying to write a song about Pando ... 
Sounders get Nkufo . Nice . I'm playing the Open Mic tonight . Nice as well . 
AGH !!!!!! Just as I think I'm ready to turn in my research application , I realize that I missed a signature !!! 
Today we found out that - SHOCK - Democracy is anti-intellectual . 
Really wishes Trimble would stop turning the heat off randomly . 
Migraine on homework day is bad . 
Huh ... Um . Snow . Okay . 
I never did like Rilke's poetry - why is his prose so lovely ? 
Doesn't do reading that is assigned less than 24 hours before class . Ever . If you want me to read it , you can give me appropriate warning that I will need to . 
Why does UEFA insist on using the away-goals tie-breaker for two-leg games ? Shootouts are WAY more fun and interesting . 
If you're having patent problems I feel bad for you son/I got 99 problems , copyright ain't one . 
\This v for Vengeance/This v for vehemence/This v for victory/This v for Vercingetorix \"" 
God dammit , Sounders ! 
K - Spring break shopping is done . Good job , self ...

The role of Bad Religion in the teenage awakening of so many musicians is really cool ... 
Tired . 
Hour and a half long LoL game . O.o 
LoL Que leavers ... Evil , evil bastards . 
MLS strike highly likely . Sad . =( 
God Dammit , Bartell's! 
9-0-14 on a game with teemo ? Jeez ! 
Heh - the copyright thugs are hitting Britain now . If it passes , its time to boycott all British labels here in the US . 
New CBA means MLS will run this year - not sure if the players got the deal they should have , but that will have to wait until I actually read the agreement . 
Well , it ain't perfect , but hey , I get to live to see 26 if nothing else ... =) 
That one was for < PROPMALE > Kennedy . 
Well - the upside is that I found the 30 sources I need for the paper . The downside is that I now have to sift through all of them . 
Hmm ... To cover < PROPFIRST > Bragg or < PROPMALE > Springsteen on Thursday ? 
Contact < PROPMALE > McKenna , tell him his suit doesn't represent Washington State or our values . 
Beep Boop Beep Boop ! Ro-bama wants to eat your brains ! Beep Boop Beep Boop ! 
O.o < PROPMALE > Costello , when did you break into my musical repertoire ?! 
Conservatives - Get your own under control . Now . 
Goddamnit Open Mic - why do you have to coincide with First Kick ? And why did I have to write a good song that I want to play right before said Open Mic ? 
Split 20/2/7 - somehow I got dumped in a low ELO game . 
wishes he was as cool as that @ < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > cat 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Greenfield are terrible , terrible people . =( 
Anyone want to request a song for tomorrow ? I have no idea what I'm playing for my second ( or third , I suppose ) piece . No covers , unless its simple enough for me to learn in 30 minutes . :P 
Welp ... That totally wasn't worth the money I spent on it . Thanks , MLS ! 
So ... NYT ... We do have this sport called \soccer\ " in this country ... " 
Never had to write a chaptered work before ... Risk in the Security Environment ? I can do this . Just as soon as I figure out how to structure the chapters . 3 chapters is one too few ! 
EBSCOhost FAIL ... I can't get Morgenthau's seminal work ? Jesus ... 
Got to use War Games as a paper introduction . A strange game ... 
Oh Schopenhauer , you bitter , bitter little man ... 
Um ... Someone broke into my room ? Maybe ? If so , they sort of failed at the pranking or stealing part of the action ... 
thinks people need to stop being surprised that Tacoma is acting like it always has . We do live in the valley between two large mountain ranges , right off of a large body of water , you know ... 
Eh - Risk perception amongst Offensive and Defensive Neorealists ... Sooooooo sleepy ... 
Oh you might say I'm absurd/But the earth was shaken not stirred/On the day the giant Martinis/Took over the world . 
Cut his finger open on a dull door ? 
When we are scared we can hide in our reveries/But what we need is a change of ideas 
Topeka 
Is increasingly sympathetic to Constructivism as an IR framing ... 
and the paper that will not die is done !!! 
Well .... Astronomy , Calculus , Greek Myth , and Game Theory ... This schedule will be interesting ... 
Armstrong , Barber , Huntington , Fukuyama , and Bin-Laden ... This weekend is going to be a study in frustrating prose . 
Oh for fuck's sake , I can't get away from Stochasticity and Perception , even in a video game !!! 
Got his first reject from a literary journal . Apparently backhandedly critiquing most of their material is not a good way to get in . Whoda thunk ? 
Love ya'll on the other side of campus , but I'm not walking all the way out there again , It's coooold . 
dreamed he was playing football ... Until < PROPFEMALE > Maddow woke him up to warn him that the martians were invading ... 
Got to use a Fugazi song as a paper title !! No one but me will get the joke ... =( 
Complaint : Why didn't Armstrong include < PROPMALE > Qaeda in her second edition of The Battle for God ? I'm sick of blindly trying to bridge from Qutb to Bin Laden without any context ! 
Done with 4 pages for IR paper . 5 or so more to go . 
No , norton , my PC security is not at risk - you've just been replaced with a security system that doesn't view corporate spyware as an acceptable incursion . 
Get's distracted with articles discussing Islam and hiphop . O.o 
finds a certain sick delight in getting to add ( sic ) to quotes by Osama Bin Laden . 
Well , that's my worst paper in at least a year . Yuck ... Ah well . 
I used 24 sources in that paper ?! O.o Ah well ... 10 pages down , 59 more to go . 
Writes poetry ? Huh . 
Got classes . All good . First semester in college without a politics course . o.o 
Ah - Process of Belief , an underrated album , to be sure . 
Can't make up his mind which song to record on Saturday ... 
\I was a teenage anarchist/The revolution was a lie/Do you remember when you were young/And you wanted to set the world on fire ? \"" 
Got a summer research < PROPMALE > ! Does anyone know of a place that I can sublet for the summer ? 
as per the request of my ethicist ... 
o.o K ... So , lesson here : if you smoke , and you're gonna fly , buy a nicotene gum . If you really think it's clever to smoke on a plane , you deserve what you're gonna get when an Air < PROPFIRST > smells smoke . Fucking moron . 
Torn between two competing forces ... Curiosity ... Caution ... 
God dammit Trimble ! Stop turning off the heat on the coldest goddamn night of the year ! 
< PROPMALE > McClaren is dead . I'm not sure if this is sad , or merely unfortunate . 
Sociology . Yuck . Ick , Ick , Ick , Ick , Ick . I swear to God , one more word of socialist anti-modern crap and I'm going to tear out my hair and go running around campus screaming expletives at the unfortunate prospective students touring the school ! 
I'm going to Bento with < PROPMALE > at 5:15 . Since no one is picking up their damn phones , you can call me if you want to come along . -.- 
I used a medical journal in a politics paper ... O.o 
6 more pages down , 53 to go . 
There's a terrorist group called the Moro Islamic Liberation Front ? Really ? Did no one in the naming process go : Hey guys , maybe \Moro Islamic Liberation Group\ " might be better . Apparently awkward naming processes are not limited to the teabaggers . " 
Just got out of the studio . Got three tracks down , two are going on the CMN album ( Old Time Religion , Don't Wanna Dance ) . It was fun , but I'm tired . 
< PROPFIRST > Lieberman : you sir are an idiot . An unmitigated , self-absorbed idiot without the sense God gave a beagle . Missile Defense is a red herring - it doesn't work . Deterrence is < PROPMALE > . 
God dammit , EBSCO , if I wanted to use Adobe to read PDFs , I'd HAVE it . Let me use Foxit ! 
RAND ... I love you . Can I be you ? 
Blah , blah , blah . Failure of the Kyoto Doctrine . Unanimity and defection in environmental security . God , I'm putting myself to sleep with this essay ... 
6 down , 47 more to go . o.o 
Okay , Facebook ... Here's a secret : I'm not a Republican ! Stop fucking advertising them to me ! Seriously ! 
K - day off . 
Sometimes , I forget how fun it is to troll the stupid but opinionated . It is at those times that I am handed a piece of pure comic gold to do with as I please . Thank you , stupid blogger #344 , 185 , you have made my day . By being a giant , flamingly stupid target . 
Oh God ... My ELO just shot up again ... This is gonna hurt . 
If I gave all of this scholastic stuff up , I'd open my own meadery and make Maraschino Melomel , Granny-Smith Cyser , and Chocolate Methyglyn ... I dream of someday being able to regularly brew . 
Why is my sub-conscious < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > correcting me on points of theology ? 
Waltzing is fun . o.O Whoda thunk ? 
Learning Spanish Bombs , maybe playing a covers-set at the next open mic , Ghost of < PROPMALE > Joad , Spanish Bombs , and whatever I'm playing with < PROPFIRST > . 
Randomly got into the SCII Beta ... o.o 
The upside is that CHWS had appointments open , and I got in and got told that I should have come in on Monday . The bad news is that I get to go back Thursday and Friday . 
If I ever start a metal band again , they will be called Hour of Lead . 
Some days are just strange ... 
13/1/2 ? I knew I liked playing Teemo . 
Query for those of you who do math on campus - do you know if there are any computers on campus where I can access SPSS ? 
-_- Paper time , with special guest , medical appointment . 
In the mild hours of May , dead goddesses spring to life/ Dancing a reel that fathers taught to sons/ Before the Romans came - 
Wow ... Work , work , work , work , work . Working from 9:00 til 6:00 today , in all likelihood . 
Okay - 8 hours sleep - Sounders , paper , Palaver , paper . o.o 
Beautiful goal from Fucito !!! Sounders gonna win this ! 
Palaver was fun , thanks Hum house !! - Every time I encounter more Nietzche , I become more convinced that he was an untreated bipolar sufferer . He's got all of the standard manic confidence and depressed disassociation ... 
Typically , the part of my paper with the most media coverage has the least useful data . Why is it so hard to find the actual cost of combating digital piracy ? Fuckin ' figures ... 
12 pages done . 35 left . -_- ... 
Same thing day after day- tube - work - dinner - work - tube - armchair - TV - sleep - tube - work -how much more can you take ? - one in ten go mad , one in five cracks up 
No , really , it doesn't surprise me all that much that tribal , regionalist south Mexico has more social capital than the crime-ravaged north . Also , I could get used to working with SPSS ... If it weren't so damned expensive . 
It is MRSA ... Fuuuuuuck . 
Out of the hospital - Might even go to class tomorrow . -_- 
Going to sleep - if the gods are kind , I will wake up feeling better , and thus not have to go to the hospital again tomorrow . That would really piss me off ... 
I assume that the Republicans obsession with things being jammed down their throats indicates their nascent fear of strawberry preserves . 
The good news ? I'm feeling better . The bad news ? I seem to have caught a cold . -_- 
For those of you wondering why we needed the digital records system in the HCR < PROPMALE > , the bullshit I have been through in the last 24 hours is a great example . The ER fucked up and gave me Clyndamycine , which this is resistant to - they only just realized , and are now putting me on Doxycycline , which I could have gotten at CHWS yesterday . Morons . 
The upside is that < PROPMALE > really liked the song I chose for my essay title . The downside is he gave the paper a B . 
In those last antediluvian days The Administration found that Human Kind Was too big to fail . And so they found the drunkest fool in all of < PROPMALE > . And bailed him out 
The good news is , it does look like the medicine they gave me is working ... 
Riot Games ' President is named < PROPFIRST > ? Interesting ... we truly are everywhere . 
No , Facebook , you cannot work with partner programs to distribute my personal information . 
Wishes he was still in England so he could go see Pressure Drop ... 
Horse-shit call gets FC < PROPFIRST > a draw they didn't deserve . That was total crap . 
Wants to go kick a soccer ball around , but , typically , can't find anyone else . =( 
Woot - one last medical appointment and then I'm free ! 
K - so , I'm really tired of the Poly-baiting from the Republicans ( and some Democratic activists ) . Even if gay marriage does lead to Poly marriage , why is that wrong ? 
Probably ought to get to work ... But I'm really not feeling motivated . 
Headache ... 
Gets to see < PROPFIRST > tomorrow !!! 
K - write two pages , then done for the day . 
Fuck you , Lexis-Nexis . 
Two new Avantasia albums ? Me wants ! 
K , that was an interesting night of RP - I really didn't expect to end up playing a character struggling to assert themselves when I made this character . Heh . Interesting . 
Bah . Humbug . Evans is a great wing , but he really shouldn't be played at forward . 
1/3rd of the way done with my second to last paper ... o.o 
< PROPFIRST > is awesome ! He came and played soccer with me ( < PROPFIRST > is awesome because he did yesterday) ! 
25/2/3 in a practice game with TF ? Yes , that will do quite nicely ... 
The nice thing about finishing the < PROPMALE > unit in Iran/ < PROPMALE > is that I can now banish from my mind the frustration that the entire damn situation conjures within me . The not nice thing is that I had the last comment in class , and I basically had to acknowledge that peace was impossible . 
New York Times : \The Basij is a pro-government vigilante group . \ " Uh ... What ? " 
Why is there so much I have to do . I just want to rest . 
Well - that was a nap I shouldn't have taken . o.o 
Supposes that he might manage to make some waves by performing \Here's to the State of Arizona\ " tomorrow ... " 
What the fuck , Security ? Every time I park my car in a new god damn parking place , I get a new fucking email bitching at me for parking there . 
Internet back - I fucked up my open mic set something hard , but at least I have my precious tubes back . 
FAIR goes after SPLC ? Fuckers ! 
Open office has a dirty mind ! 
Paper done ?! O.o I wrote 6 pages out of the blue this morning . Only 15-20 left for the semester ... 
There we are - the song that has been attempting to emerge all week is now written - it just needs edits . 
Hopefully , this is the last time I have to go to the hospital . 
Thanks to folks who have helped out while I've been in and out of the hospital . If anyone is not too busy , I may be going in again tomorrow late morning - if your homework will allow , I could use some company . 
Good news - It does seem better today . If its not much better by tomorrow , I'll do the hospital then . 
Reading Mousavi's use of the word \hipster\ " in a < PROPMALE > speech just made my day ( can that translation really be accurate ? ) . " 
Dad : \It's really not that ( yawn ) dry ( yawn ) of a paper . \ " Heh . " 
Well , aside from the wind , its a good day ! That doesn't make it easier to walk into the wind to try and get to class , though . My hair is quite displeased . 
Oh , so this is how it feels when your life is actually under your control again ... o.o 
Well , it was a shitty game and I played like shit , but I got to troll the asshats I was teamed with , so it all evens out . 
Insomnia , old friend , while I am quite glad to re-encounter you from time to time , I do wish you would wait until after school is out for such an extended visit ... 
Occasionally I read my own work and wonder when I got so cold-blooded ... Meh . 
And today I become < PROPMALE > ! <.< 
No chord sets for The smashing of the < PROPFIRST > ? Bah ! 
Getting pumped for the World Cup - Preliminary roster comes out next week : my guess is that < PROPMALE > picks up Edson Buddle and that < PROPMALE > Evans sadly doesn't make it . 
Elections geek ? Me ? No , I'm just sitting here watching the UK election while I could be writing a paper ... 
Looks like a < PROPMALE > parliament , not good for the LDs - Not cool . 
Okay - a little bit of clarification , LibDems point out that the uniform swing exit polls have been very bad . I'm not confident in that prediction . 
Lib Dems may take this as evidence of the failure of FPTP . 
No results yet - watching BBC is hilarious - they are worse than we are about speculation before an election ... 
Labor get first seat - lost 10% , however , on their previous < PROPFIRST > , Tories gained only 5% . 
\Fortress Scottland\ " has held for Labour - unsurprising . SNP will never gain seats under FPTP . " 
At this point , I'm making a careful estimate that there is no < PROPMALE > parliament , and the Conservative party takes majority . 
Conservatives do fairly well in Sunderland South , but don't win - Weird results . Doesn't do well with any model . Close seats may look very different this time . 
Taking a break from liveblogging to do a bit of writing - probably an hour til we start getting more results . 
How do you solve a problem like Somalia ? 
LD reps look nervous to me - some hard spinning going on here . Ireland results coming in . Nothing interesting here , really . 
Plaid Cymru ( Said Plyed Coomry ) pick up a seat in Wales . 
First < PROPFIRST > seat - 9.4% swing - Bad for Labor if they can do this elsewhere . 
Lib Dems hold Torbay . 5.4% gain for LD , but not great against Conservatives so much as Labour . 
10/4/2 right now , lab , con , LD . -1/+1/0 Uniform swing seems pretty crap , but none of the models have come out great here . 
Intrade likes a conservative majority right now - I'm on the fence , but if I had to bet , I'd bet < PROPFIRST > right now . 
LD loses Durham to Labor . Bad news for them . 
19/5/4 and /-3/2/0 right now , Cons pick up one more . 
Good news for Tories , they win Battersea . 
I'm going to bet on < PROPMALE > parliament right now , cautiously . 
Back to the fence , I suppose . Some interesting results thus far . 
-17/+18/-1 I'm betting < PROPMALE > parliament . 
Okay - Britain will have a < PROPMALE > Parliament , but God knows whether a coalition can be formed . New elections may be called . 
Yay . Hospital again . Just what I fucking needed . 
Damnit reading period - somehow , I was already on Sunday ... Mother's day ( and < PROPFIRST>'s birthday ) are TOMORROW ... >.> 
This is just an embarrassingly bad game , Sounders . =( 
Motivation ? =( 
Well , that's gonna give me nightmares for the next month . 
Finds the fact that he is reading a report on bioterrorism from a man named Khan truly ironic ... 
CHWS is incredible . I love them sooo much . 
Hey , Mexico gets some hardcore badass points for endorsing the United States ' World Cup bid ! 
Only one final left =D 
And Allanmoore demonstrates that they remain completely unable to communicate with patients . -_- Nothing severe or to worry about , but I really , REALLY wish that they would assume that I can understand complex data-sets at or above the level they can . 
45 sources ? Did I really do that to myself ? Why ? 
That was quite possibly the most trippy doctors visit I have ever had . 
well - that was good move-out progress ... Save for the fact that I still need to decide what I am storing and what I am bringing home ... <.< 
Well , either I've been the target of an attempt at stealing my identity ... OR the Chinese government has designated me a person of interest . Neither one of these thoughts is particularly comforting . 
You know you are a goalkeeper when you see the WC advertisements and are annoyed that they only show goals being scored , not being saved . 
Goddamn it , Iraq ! Stop releasing news that undermines one of my core arguments the day after I turn a paper in ! This is not okay ! 
Nom , nom , nom Mr. < PROPMALE > . I am feeling fat and sassy . I eat your DPS - I eat it all ! 
< PROPMALE > year done . 
Oh good - I have interbutts here . 
awaits grades with a sense of dread ... 
misses everyone already ... =( 
Sounders win . =D 
Dio's dead ? =( 
My ethercraft is full of Quantum Eels ! 
Eh - turns out there are still a large number of words I need to learn . 
Summoner's Rift game with a feeder who fed the other team 30 kills - we managed to pull together and win it - I split 27/7/11 - God that was difficult . 
Made chili . Yum . 
Well played to the progressives - you all managed to play tough cards and win some hard battles tonight . I know when its time to gg and accept that I was wrong . 
When Cormac < PROPMALE > Airt , the proper definition of halcyon , and the differences between < PROPMALE > and celtic assessments of the role of beauty in good ( and there really weren't many differences ) are running around in your head unchecked , attempting colloquial songwriting is a lost cause . Blast . 
27/10/12 and a win with a ragequitter ? I seem to better in 4 v 5 ... 
The one World Cup prediction I do feel safe making is that < PROPFEMALE > will not win this year - unless they enter the Volleyball World Cup , < PROPFIRST > shows promise for that . 
I suppose the realization ought to be that empty words aren't measured in syllables , but in the void between the heart and the vocal chords . 
I tend to avoid the I/P issue , since I think both sides are run by war-loving morons with no actual interest in peace , but I am offended that < PROPMALE > believes it has the right to deem American citizens who have Palestinian ancestors to be Palestinian for the purpose of travel and law . 
Vanilla Methyglin is in the carboy and Raspberry Melomel ( which is a beautiful purplish-red ) is on the boil . 
< PROPFIRST > Bragg's \A Pict Song\ " is an interesting piece of work - how often does someone choose the Picts as a tribe to glorify ? " 
I've always been puzzled by the word \plutocracy\ " - wouldn't it be more accurate for it to mean rule by the dead ? Perhaps rule by boring traditionalists who are condemned to a third-tier of power and thus kidnap innocents and trick them into spending half of the year with them ? " 
GREs tomorrow and the butterflies decide to start right now . Fuck . 
Well - fish is good for your memory , right ? The cats certainly seem to think so - On to the GREs . To be honest , I'm more nervous about the drive down than the tests ... 
750 verb 710 math - eh . 
Sonata Arctica made for an interesting < PROPFIRST > Mouse on my drive home - although I still hear \Respect the Wilderness\ " incorrectly every time I listen to it . We may have our lucid dog ? If you say so ... " 
First US friendly pre-WC tonight ! ~ Looking forward to it . 
Watching the US play - not bad . I want to see the actual starters , though . 
US drops one 4-2 to the Czech side . Ugly end , but they showed promise . I suppose the question is : what will they look like with Altidore , < PROPMALE > , and Dempsey on the pitch ? 
I get really weird the more I stay up late - It's a good thing that once I get back to Tacoma I'll be living on a normal schedule . 
3.67 - 2 A's , an A- , and a B . I'm fine with the first three , but the B is typical < PROPMALE > Milam . I'm fairly certain he doesn't give any other grades . 
Sounders v Boca tonight - < PROPFIRST > and I have tickets in the first level . I'm looking forward to it . Also , US 23 man roster out - anyone have thoughts on it ? 
Bored sitting and waiting to leave for the Sounders game ... I suppose that the lesson here is that eventually you do run out of things to pretend to be doing ... 
Did I mention that the Sounders game was freakin ' awesome ? We were stuck in front of a bunch of Boca Juniors fans who were being snide for the first half , but they shut up pretty quickly after Levesque finished the rebound on Montero's free kick . 
< PROPFEMALE > Speaks Out - Thank you so much , Republicans . I haven't had this much fun in years ! 
Will be deleting my facebook - you can contact me at Hammerfist@gmail.com or at my UPS email if you like . I'm sick of their privacy incompetancy , so I'm done . I'll stick to Google Buzz from now on . 
Okay , so ... In the end , I need the information from facebook more than I realized . It's only after you quit that you realize how useful it is for getting the information you need . 
Underwhelmed by the IDF's bungling of yet another operation ... 
Still insufficient internets . 
Finally - Interbutts ! 
Another Japanese prime minister down ? Heh . The cost of parliamentarianism is that sometimes you have 5 Prime Ministers in 5 years ... 
Apparently the core group of the Tiananmen Square Protesters liked to meet around a statue of Cervantes ... Once again , the law of universal irony is prooven . 
Chili =) 
Rome never looks where she treads/Always her heavy hooves fall 
Was surprisingly the winner at Risk tonight ... For once , Kant reigns supreme ! 
Sleep ? I've heard of that ... 
-_- Why is it that only idiots write on politics and the interbutts ? 
Stock up on cheap plastic shit now , because I predict a significant price increase over the next two years ... 
Foucault is stalking me ... I keep trying to avoid him , trying to avoid reading him , trying to avoid acknowledging that he even exists ... But he keeps showing up in my research and insisting that I acknowledge his work . Why ?! 
Got a 6 on the writing for the GRE . =D 
Vaguely disappointed that < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > won - there was no way either of them was going to win the general , but I would have liked to see her shamed for her health care vote . Ah well - in the end , the better campaigner won . Halter's people fucked up GOTV and payed for it . 
Progress and how I'm not making it ... 
Okay well - I suppose watching the movement of news on Twitter is actually research . Heh . 
6:00 am in the morning in my World Cup ? It's more likely than you'd think . =D 
If SA wins 1-0 , it will be a scandal ... 
100 data points ... * deep breath * But R is fighting with me . \ 
\ 
Time to code a new set of data ! =( 
Ah - Graduate school spam . Delightful . 
I'm hard pressed to think of a more disparate experience than watching the WC and watching the ongoing events in Iran . 
At home watching the game - England , I'll support you after we're out , but for now , GO USA ! 
GOOOOOOOOOOAL !!!!! Shouldn't have been , but Green fucked up hard ... 
USA Draws ? Interesting ... 
Begins to wonder whether the use of abjection in the human form in early Gunnerkrigg Court was a purposeful choice by the artist . 
Ouch - Australia got murdered .... 
So sick of transcribing information . -_- 
Not sure how I feel about some of the Season One stuff - Bans are interesting , but it will depress my ELO like fuck ... 
Well - it was a productive day , in a sense ... 
Oh Prothero - not only are you wrong , you're waaaaaay our of your depth . 
Is sick of hearing people complain about the vuvuzuelas . They really aren't that bad . 
So much for really durable belt ... 
Some of the politics I have come across in my research are just fucked up . I got a lecture on \Obama's Organ Harvesting Plan\ " this morning . O.o " 
Well - the US never fails to fail ... 
Eh - 2-2 is nice , but not winning this is not okay . 
The US won 3-2 , but the fucking ref fucked up a critical call . 
Oh FFS - Convergence zones in my life are never a good thing . The world cup traffic has brought Twitter down , thus keeping me from taking a sample at the designated time for my research ! 
Poor bird ... 
0 - 0 ? Wow - didn't see that coming at all ... 
Okay , Rockband 3 looks kinda cool . The real guitar is awesome . 
Dad came to see me for father's day - I'm glad . 
Blessed solstice - I had almost completely forgotten ... 
Blessed Solstice . 
Sometimes I have to massage passages to get Google Translator to give me a good translation , but today that backfired on me , when I tried to break a word down into its constituent parts , and accidentally turned the word \Repression\ " into \ " Children's Camp \"..." 
Finally done taking data sets in - now just recording them !!! 2 or 3 more weeks and I'll have a massive amount of quality data . 
What a twist ! 
And the far right pull out their collective stupid and begin to whine about < PROPMALE > McCrystal being held responsible for his own words to a reporter ... Sorry , but when an officer trashes his commanding officer to the media , he risks court martial . Leave your politics at the door , kiddies . 
USMNT trying to give me a heart-attack .... 
And that's that - we fail to make elimination . 
FUCK YES !!! BITE MY TONGUE !!!!!! THANK THE GODS FOR < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > !!!!!!!! 
So - I actually have to go see Bumbershoot this year - < PROPFIRST > Bragg is playing . 
Ghana plays really pretty football . The ball control they have is amazing . 
Well - the first attempt at day 4 of the 365 days of poetry challenge was well on its way to utter and abject failure , until < PROPMALE > inspired me . Thanks housemate ! 
5 days into the 365 day challenge - 360 poems until victory is mine ! 
Set one is finally done . Now I need to figure out my randomizing method for set two ... 
I thought that set recording was bad ... I'm falling asleep doing this part ... 
< PROPMALE > and Miria's butchering of Far Eastern myth is pretty hillarious , but I'm fairly certain it goes over the heads of any western viewers ... 
GO USA ! 
< PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > ... Cmon .... 
Okay . Sounders - please play good , this time . 
If my research has taught me anything , it is the danger posed by well meaning people . 
That was an interminable struggle to get the rest of the data formatted . I think I will curl up in my corner and stare blankly at the wall for a while now ... 
The music from Durarara is full of cute little musical jokes , if you know your Celtic music . The music from the end of Episode 8 ( which is about dreaming ) , ends with the theme from \Fairytale of New York \"." 
Writes really brutal poetry when he lets his work influence him ... 
Walking is not fun right now . My knee makes really funny noises . 
I had thought that , after leaving London , I would never again encounter the mild agony of seeing the store \Game\ " . Then I watched Durarara and the cycle began anew . " 
Hmm - outright fraudulent pollsters , eh ? Clumsy - its harder to fake your results to the point that no one will ever notice than it is to just collect the data ... 
< PROPMALE > Gabreski , < PROPMALE > Phend , < PROPMALE > Schwarzenberger , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > - Game is at 20:00 rather than 18:00 tonight . 
< PROPMALE > Stark loses points for smart self-presentation , but who cares . Someone needed to face the Teabaggers and laugh in their pathetic , little , faces . Dear lord , they're a pathetic bunch of bed-wetting whiners , aren't they ? 
I'm a little disturbed by how quickly I get my Japanese back after only a few hours of watching anime ... 
Dreamed of debating class warfare with a person convinced he had class identity . Awoke clever and classless and free , and all that jazz . 
Well fuck - the end of Code Geass is nearly as depressing as the end of Evangelion . Fuck this shit , I'm not watching giant-robot shows any more . 
Without the World Cup going , I need something to keep my brain busy during data entry sessions ... 
Issue 1 of My findings on use of the hashtag #iranelection ( not quite complete ): I find that in June of 2009 , Persian language usage made up 2.7% of usage . It now makes up 20.3% of usage . 
It ain't easy when you're runnin a Ponzi scheme of Stuuuuupid ! 
Persian usage in the summer of 2009 on Twitter has fallen to 2.3% with the addition of more data . 
Second < PROPMALE > finding of my research project : The letter I am most likely to forget when writing an alphabetized index is the letter ' R ' ... \ 
<.< 
Is rooting for Germany - regardless of anything else , they play beautiful soccer , and I've been impressed with the strength of their passing game . 
5 sets left ... Just 100 more of these damn tweets and I never ever have to do this again ... 
Well , that's sad - I find the Spanish team really boring to watch , and the Dutch aren't that much better . The final will be more of a chess game then an athletic competition . \ 
On the other hand , the 3rd place match will be incredible ... Two counterattacking teams with strong shooting forwards . 
Done . Gods willing , I will never have to enter that much data by hand again in my life ... 
Thinks he might attempt a boxbot costume for Halloween - I will spend the whole day running around shouting : \Hellllooooooo \"" 
It was a great game - we were right by the hooligans . Lots of fun . 
In Montana . 
Well , the upside is that I got 6 , rather than 4 hours of sleep , this time ... 
So many mosquitoes ... 
That was not onside ... 
And the most boring European side ever wins ... 
Coming back to Tacoma tomorrow . Damn me for missing another day of work . 
Has been bested by the assanine password requirements of the university . 
Required summoner level 20 ... =( 
Well ... I have the data , I've done preliminary exploration , found that secondary exploration really isn't necessary ( correlation , what's that ? ) - and find that the obvious answer was , indeed , correct ... This is difficult ... 
The Konami code for LoL is my new best friend ... 
The only thing worse than sucking in a game is sucking because the rest of your team keeps putting you in terrible positions and then blaming you for their tactical incompetence ... 
Apparently , our smoke detector is possessed ... 
Hates introductions ... 
Occasionally , my work takes me in strange directions .... 
< PROPMALE > Phend , < PROPMALE > Gabreski , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > In case there was any question , there is no game tonight , since both < PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE > are out of town . 
Deeply upset with Twitter for their archive shenanigans . 
Needs to stop writing poetry late at night ... 
Loves Amumu . =D 
Is caught in a hazy world of Solidarnosc , early Shariati recordings , and mimeography ... Literature reviews are unpleasant . 
Level 20 , I could play ranked games . After my last 3 non-ranked games , I'm not too excited about this fact . 
Inception was excellent . And a mindfuck . I'm working on a Pen and Paper system for it . 
This may be blasphemous , but I don't understand why the USSF is working so hard to keep < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > . Don't get me wrong - he's a good coach , but he did a good job , not a miraculous job , so we should do what national teams do with good coaches : thank him for his wonderful service , give him good recommendations to go work in Europe , and bring in new blood . 
Has lost his phone - if you find it , please call him and - oh ... shit . -_- 
found my phone . 
The methodology section is the confessional of the researcher . Forgive me colleagues for I have sinned - and here is the exact detail which you should avoid reproducing if you attempt to reproduce my results ... 
Thinks that if WBBC is actually targeting Comic Con , its the best damn thing that's ever happened to Comic Con . Guys , you should invite them to come worship devils with you in D&D ! 
We're gonna need a montage ! 
The crux isn't that everybody wants to RULE the world - it's that everyone wants to save it , and the would-be rescuers are like most such fools they don't know what they're doing . Post-modernism has created 50 years of folks who haven't the drive to educate themselves or the facts to better the world . God forbid we return to silent generation morality , but it would be nice if more people just wanted to rule the world 
Playing Soraka has made my stats look very strange for ranked ... 
Oh Dino-Sore Rossi - you are a pathetic , pathetic little creature . Luckily , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > is going to hand you your ass in November , and send you back to the pitiful little life of ignominy you so rightfully deserve . 
Oh fuck you , Riot ! I regularly play with level 30s who have 20+ leaves , and I have none in well over 100 games played . There were better ways to fix this problem that didn't involve making ranked games inaccessible to us for another god damned month ! 
13 footnotes worth of definitions in just 12 pages ... O.o 
< PROPMALE > Phend , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > Gabreski , < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Greenfield - game will be held tonight around 8:00 or 8:30 , depending on which is better for < PROPMALE > . Prepare for epic . 
The only way that I'd ever root for the Philly Union : when the other option is fucking Man United . 
Pounding head on desk , fighting with R ... 
GAH !!!!!!! Screwed up and I'm back to square fucking one ! 
Does anyone want to go see the Sounders play in the Concacaf champions league next Wednesday ? 
Has finished rewatching < PROPFEMALE > Otome , and finds himself at loose ends , anime wise . Suggestions for someone who liked Durarara , Baccano , Darker than Black , Ergo Proxy , Blood+ , Serial Experiments Lain , and Paranoia Agent ? 
At 49/3/1 I got bored of ganking practice and pushed the top < PROPFIRST > from 3 towers deep on one creep wave . =D 
Wow - Go 3/4/4 on a team full of feeding morons and get bitched out for my play . This is why I don't normally play solo que . 
Went to go work on the possible Avatar Scion game and roll up random sires , and ended up with an entirely too appropriate list - It troubled him deeply . 
Built a sunfire shaco for the lulz ... With Otherme , it's pretty fucking potent ... 400 AoE damage and 4000 health ... 
You can find your normal game ELO in the logs of your games - mine is apparently 1093 , which makes me quite sad . 
http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/talk/blogs/a/m/americandad/2010/03/an-open-letter-to-conservative.php?ref=mp\ 
Well sourced and constructed - a short list of the many wrongs that conservative < PROPFEMALE > is guilty of . The next time I need to make a basic case about contemporary conservatism , I'll let this guy do it for me . 
Oh - so that's how Shaco would have worked if I had known what I was doing ... 
Um ... Did Riot roll back their Ranked Games setup ? 
Well , this is the highest scoring first 20 I've ever seen ... 
Sounders win - I don't like the Rapids , they're a bunch of thugs . 
Oh < PROPMALE > Tancredo - you so crazy . 
Apple loses on DRM case - fuck year . Jailbreaking becomes legal . Presumably , big media will throw a temper-tantrum and do a doody in their pants unless they can get even more protection from the government . 
Is occasionally a terrible person - particularly when he trolls Tea Partiers intensely . 
Screw SC II , I'm getting Vladimir ... With IP , probably . 
Wow - Riot releases a cool champion and whole game starts whining without ever actually facing him in combat . 
I do love it when a good troll pays off . =D 
Hmm - and now the dilemma of when , and how , to let the troll die - my targets are becoming boring ... 
New Bad Religion Album out soon ? Yes Please ! 
It's vaguely funny to watch LA losing to a USL 2 team ... 
< PROPMALE > Schwarzenberger , < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Greenfield , < PROPMALE > Gabreski : No game tonight . There are only 3 of you , and my inspiration pool has failed me . 
This paper doesn't end ... It goes on , and on , and on , and on , and on ! 
Congratulations , people taking part in the 365 days of poetry challenge - you are officially 10% done , if you are caught up ( I'm looking at you , everyone but < PROPFIRST > and I ! ) 
Really hates US Bank - Really . Really , Really , Really . Their internet banking is fucking out to get me and it makes me very , very angry . 
Never thought that a finance error in his favor would cause him distress . 
Finds it funny that of the 7 or so Republicans running for Senate in the state , only Rossi and Didier managed to produce spell-checked voter's guide statements . My favorite Tea Party spelling ? The asshat who proclaims himself \Pro- < PROPFIRST > Gault(sic ) . \ " Apparently he never bothered to read the divine Ayn well enough to spell the name correctly . Typical \ " libertarian\ " ? I think so ! " 
< PROPMALE > Fernandez ! Nice ! 
Progress this week ? hahaha ! 
Around the time I realized I was playing the same segment of the game for the 4th time through and I was out of ammo , low on health , and in the position to spend all of my remaining money rearming myself , I realized that I was no longer having fun playing Borderlands ... 
Suffering from insomnia ? Want something that will put you out faster than a sledge-hammer to the < PROPFEMALE > ? My research paper is just what you need ! 
Why do I have 11 books of material for a 200 level course ? 
Summing up my entire paper into a sentence : The Twitter Revolution was a revolution of spectators , who were using a new tool to observe the ongoing civil unrest in Iran . 
Refs for CCL suck hard ... 
I am mildly puzzled by the string of killings in Chinese schools recently - I'm not sure where this trend has come from . 
And suddenly , during the conclusion of my paper , my good friend's < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > and Bootstrap showed up and reminded me that I was a moron with more tools than I remembered ... 
< PROPMALE > Gabreski , < PROPMALE > Phend , < PROPMALE > Schwarzenberger , < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Greenfield Game is at either my place or < PROPMALE>'s place at 19:00 tonight . 
Draft One done - when I have rudimentary edits done , I will send out a read-able copy to everyone who wants it . If you do want it , I need an email address from you , though - because its a little bit too large for Facebook . 
PROP 8 OVERRULED ! OH HELL YEAH ! 
Staples Chair fail ... 
Oh for fuck's sake - Borderlands has randomly stopped working . 
Just bothered to read a < PROPFEMALE > for the first time in his life , and was pleasantly surprised . The < PROPFEMALE > for SpyBot Search and Destroy is absolutely endearing . 
Wants the Pathfinder Advanced Player's Guide ... Very much . Not for the classes - for the 100 new feats . 
Seattle 2 < PROPMALE > 0 . Excellent game . < PROPMALE > played well in the first half , but they just got steamrolled in the second . Fernandez didn't have the sort of aggression on the left wing that Zakuani normally does , but he still got himself a goal . I'm starting to warm up to Nyassi - but he's got to stop making silly mistakes . < PROPMALE > Evans who ? 
The GOP's political strategy is genius : run mediocre campaigns that deadlock the Senate and House , not making any policy suggestions , so they can prevent the Democrats from making any progress for the next 4 or so years , so that everyone will have forgotten how terrible their ideas are and how they fucked up last time when the next election rolls around . 
Has an odd summer illness that he does not understand . 
< PROPMALE>'s game was so good , I'm writing a web-comic script for it . Downside - I still can't draw . 
Having actually read up on the guy behind the Cordoba house , I can only conclude what I regularly find myself concluding : Conservatives remain brain-dead . Let's bait the moderate , assimilated Muslims , and ignore the damage that does to our ability to combat < PROPFEMALE > extremism ! Good job , dipshits ! 
Well - Asshattery from a Ref gets < PROPFIRST > Gonzales kicked off of the pitch . 
Has a fancy new droid . Unfortunately it has killed my contacts ... 
< PROPFIRST > Pilgrim : My mental jury is still out . On the one hand , brilliant , on the other , disquieting and mildly reminiscent of < PROPMALE > Dynamite ( not a compliment ) . 
Gingrich and not-so-Breitbart are willing to show up on stage with Geert Wilder . Either they are too retarded to know who the man is , or my \Republicans are shitbags\ " thesis holds . " 
So , riddle me this : why is it anyone outside of New York's business where a group of New Yorkers build a community center ? Really , Red-state carpetbaggers , why the fuck do you care ? Aren't you supposed to be supporting state's rights , kids ? I suppose the rules don't apply when there are scary brown people around , eh ? 
< PROPFIRST > Hayes is taking apart the whole community center scandal quite well . I hope that he ends up with his show , too . 
And this is the day the world decides to shit on me . I blow out a tire ( thanks UPS construction ! ) , get home to a house which is 10 degrees above the outside ( god knows how that happened ! ) , am attacked by a wasp , which is then eaten by a spider , which it turns out is a brown recluse , which means that I have to deal with a fucking freaky spider in my kitchen . I hate spiders .

Was gratified to see references to the EPL in an American sport's-writer's work . With any luck , soccer will continue to grow in the states . 
Okay , slowing music down 800% can apparently make even shitty music sound cool . 
War is over . 
Dear bastard with the hedge trimmer right outside my window . You are Satan incarnate . Love , ( a very sleepy ) < PROPMALE > . 
< PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , and derrick : game starts at three at my house . 
Is somewhat befuddled by the fact that he remains on the mailing list for ASUPS as the treasurer of a defunct club which he hasn't been treasurer for in 2 years ... 
That screaming sound you hear is me realizing just how large my bibliography is ... Oh hey , I can leave that for later !! Right ?! Right ?!! 
How does I internet on this blasted contraption !? 
K - so , I'm passing on a message from the Norm Dicks campaign - apparently they are looking for par t-t ime employees for the election . They called me today to ask about Young Dems . That was a decidedly awkward conversation . 
Oh right .... I hate cleaning ... 
< PROPFIRST > Beck realizes the lesson of < PROPFIRST > Steele : It ain't easy running a Ponzi scheme of Stoooooopid ! 
Writes crude poetry , which also includes bad words . 
Enter the boring semester ... =( 
Spent half an hour calculating the gravitational force of a Super < PROPFEMALE > Destroyer and the Death < PROPFEMALE > . Surprisingly , they are less than I expected ... 
Is frustrated by mythologists ... they seem to make a study of missing the point . 
To my distress , I have discovered that my brain purposefully eliminates all remembered trigonometry . For the fourth time , I find myself scowling and cursing at Trigonometric identities . 
The upside is that the guy who let me in to my room was very nice . The downside is that Security is permanently on my shit list , now . An hour and a half freezing my ass off , hungry , cold , tired , and blind as a bat ... Motherfuckers ... 
Seeing < PROPFIRST > Guerewitz as one of the testimonials on Kos ' new book made me laugh pretty hard . My world is occasionally quite small ... ( Should we expect a Kos review of The Dissent of Man , now ? ) 
Sometimes I just want to copy someone elses status , parakeet for word , and see if they notice . 
3 hours a week of < PROPFIRST > Bates explaining the universe ? Best class ever ! 
Nice - Open Cup Final =D 
It's a bad day when I begin to consider the alchemical ramifications of End of Evangelion . Get out of here , Magnum Opus ! 
Cellar music has , if anything , become worse ... 
Survivor : Zendikar . Outrun , Outrun , Outrun ... 
Reading a 20th century astronomer appears to be identical to reading an 18th century mythologist - both are condescending towards the \primitives\ " ... < PROPFEMALE > sigh . " 
17 pages of work for one math assignment ? It's more likely than you'd think ... 
By the 33rd minute , the lag was so bad that I was begging my team to surrender - they dutifully informed that they had done so five minutes prior ... 
Stacking over 1000 AP on AP Cho Gath , even in a practice matche ? Priceless . 
Happy Labor Day . Hug a union member . 
Cannot motivate himself to do this damn bibliography . =( 
The realization that \Because I could not stop for death\ " can be < PROPFIRST > to the Pokemon theme just about broke me ... " 
Perfectionism has its cost - being by far the worst player on the pitch tonight , I was beating myself up for something I just can't fix . =/ 
QQing about Sunfires ? Really , Riot Forumers ? -_- 
Watching < PROPFIRST > Matalin on CNN is a little like watching paint dry . The only way you'd find it compelling is if you were huffing fumes ... 
3 Kill Soraka ? O.o Stop leaving half kills or I will take them , team . 
Supposes he won't be buying Dr. Pepper for a while . < PROPFEMALE > sad ... 
Does anyone have a laptop they'd be willing to < PROPFEMALE > me for 3 hours next Tuesday ? I need to do a presentation in the library for my summer research ... 
Riot - I know Gragas is hard to < PROPFEMALE > and all , but could you at least stop breaking my launcher and forcing me to reinstall ? 
Query : Riot , how much worse can you bork a server than you have ? Is this a freaking competition ? 
So ... How long has the 5'oclock music played by the bells been \Here Come's the Sun ? \"" 
Knowing that log10(a ) + log10(b ) = log10(ab ) means you can perform common log marriage . 
Sunfire Kennen - Best build ever . That is all . 
Mundo downsizes as he pleases ! 
4 < PROPFEMALE > bibliography ? O.o Ah well ... It's finally fucking done . Did you hear me ? The paper , minus whatever comments I get on Tuesday , is dead ! 
Presumes , given Mr. Gingrich's recent comments , that Mr. Gingrich would like to be on the record as supporting colonialism . Apparently Mr. Gingrich is unable to separate STUDYING history from clinging to history . Newt , you sick fuck , the colonial < PROPFEMALE > is dead . Go back to cheating on your dying wife and leave the civilized world in peace . 
No , < PROPFIRST > Boenhead , you cannot have $700 < PROPMALE > ion of my money to spend on your < PROPMALE > friends . Go fuck yourself . Love , the person footing the < PROPMALE > . 
Predicts that , at its current rate of progress , Gunnerkrigg Court will have made it to X-Rated material in approximately 2 more strips . We've already hit PG-13 here , folks ... Although I think < PROPMALE > is not fit for any human consumption ... 
XKCD today is particularly hilarious ... 
< PROPMALE > Financial Aid Page : Not found ... How appropriate . 
Oh Graduate Schools - So good at saying so much but so little ... 
Um - so ... I think someone may be kidnapping political scientists who work on the role of the internet in democratization ... They seem to have systematically disappeared around the year 2000 . Or gone into government work ... 
Is presenting today as part of the mass presentation of humanities and social sciences researchers in the library . It runs from 3:00 to 4:30 in the old part of the library , if you are interested , 
Is tired ... Thank you to everyone who came to see my presentation . You made my day much better . 
How much does a Mexican referee cost ? Apparently not much , since Saprissa can afford one . 
Nice to see we'll be keeping DE-Sen this cycle . 
Oh look . An evacuation drill . I think I'll go to my designated - pffft . They didn't even bother to buzz the houses . I'm staying here and writing a paper . 
Alas , scholastic papers ... You are such simulacra sometimes ... 
Thusfar , my Gunnerkrigg thesis holds ... 
Was dreaming of sharpening a sword when his alarm clock went off , piping in the lyrics to some song or another , \I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed\ " . Weird .... " 
Gunnerkrigg today : 3 of swords ? Tarot , in my Gunnerkrigg ? 
Ian : \So this looks like a crib-sheet from DDR ... How does it teach me to kill people ? \"" 
Why can't I write music ? Seriously ... 3 weeks and I can't get a chord progression I actually like !! 
4-0 against Crew ! Nice ! 
Is beginning to feel pity for the poor spiders outside of his window ( of course , in 4 weeks or so , they will have tried to come inside because the weather will be killing them , and my pity will evaporate into war-rage , but that's life ) . They appear to not understand that the unshielded side of a building will not sustain large webs . On the other hand , watching them freak out when the wind hits is hiiiiilarious . 
I'm not sure how I feel about the clips from the new BR album ... 
Olbermann ... Shut up about witchcraft . Seriously . You sound like almost as much of a douchebag as < PROPFEMALE > O'Donnel . 
Would like to invent a terrible game called \Disassociation football\ " ... All he knows is that it would be disfunctional . " 
Will be providing mead ( to those over 21 ) to anyone who wishes to take part of it ( within reason ! I only bought one bottle , and some of that is slated for offerings ) tomorrow night , in celebration of the autumnal equinox . I'll probably start things around 7:15 pm or so , at my house , since that is when the sun will set . Blessed equinox . 
Critiques of existentialism and idealist views of the soul ? In my punk rock ... It's at once more painfully banal , and entirely likely than you'd think . =/ 
The GOP clearly doesn't care about national security . They voted against funding the troops ! ( Disingenuous ? Of course . Still , I don't feel bad - they earn the giant fucking asshole award today . ) 
Keeps learning cool things about his Great Grandfather . 
Math homework wins ... =( 
Someone had etched a rune on the wall beside my chair in calculus ... better yet , I think that's where Thor sat in advanced stat . 
Watching LA and NY on the field is a lot of fun , but this is kinda a match of crippled teams , since < PROPFIRST > , < PROPMALE > , and Angel are all off of the pitch . 
TROLOLOLOLOLOLOL ! 
Just doesn't understand the Vuvuzela hate , really . I mean , yeah , 20,000 fans with them would get bad , but they aren't that common in the US or UK , and all the stadium bans just seem stupid to me . It seems more like snobbish crap than anything else to me . 
Gotta like Nkufo !!! 
Would very much like to do his homework , but YouTube is preventing him from being able to with its crappy interface . 
Bacchus ? More like BROmios am I right ? 
Thanks to XKCD , I now have a new insult in my repertoire : \Fucking peristeronic dimwit ! \"" 
Dislikes Security today - they decided to ticket my car for being unregistered in an empty lot , despite two previous years of registration . I sent them a kind love note in response . 
Why can't I find a chord progression for the traditional Annan Water ? I don't want the Decemberists song , I want the folk song . =/ 
1/0/7 ... I love < PROPFEMALE > . =D 
Now feels entirely guilty - security waved his citation . Complete with bitchy email . They win this round . 
Is annoyed with Riot for their practice game shenanigans - honestly , I think they do this just to insure I can't distract myself . 
Discovered that his head is not attached to his ethicist , this evening . It was very enlightening . 
And the GOP runs a Christian Constructionist ( Destructionist ) in Florida - One of the \Capital punishment for witchcraft\ " types . Fucker . " 
And when I finished ... The whole of Writer's Guild was staring at me like some sort of aberration . 
Sick , and thus missing lab . Unfortunately , I have to go to my last class ... 
Well - the downside is ... My science experiment failed ... \ 
The upside is , I managed to get rid of one of the really terrible apricot ales in an amusing fashion . 
Last three games as Janna : 4/3/36 =D Best support character in any game EVER ! 
This paper is killing me - - Such a terrible , terrible essay topic . 
Facebook is eating my messages - this is a bad sign ... 
CLG rocked face in the third match of WCG - my < PROPFEMALE > to add < PROPFEMALE > to my lineup is building . 
Boswell showed up in my reading today - I had missed the ornery bastard . 
May or may not be planning a terrible fate for the jerks in North Quad and their loud music . 
Well - aside from the fact that I'm still neck-deep in homework - I sure got a lot done . -_- 
Gave in and bought Minecraft ... < PROPFEMALE > sigh . 
Okay - you've had your sneering fun , kiddies - you can all stop talking about witches and go back to normal political topics . 
Sounders get the Open Cup again . It wasn't a beautiful game , but it got the job done . Good job , team . 
Well - fevers certainly make me more interesting ... 
They ask me if my world is entirely too chaotic , and I say , \YUS ! \"" 
This may be terrible , but I've simply categorized Mobutu beside < PROPFIRST > VII in my head . 
The remarkable part of the conservative strategy is that by flooding the marketplace of ideas with lies , they can make it impossible to debunk all of the crap . As a result , they then have a foundation of shit upon which to build . As I have said before , it is disgusting , but somewhat ingenious . I just wish they'd do it elsewhere . 
Seriously , guys - the power rule is not that hard f^1(x^n ) = nx^(n-1 ) . We should not have to review this each class ... -_- 
Awaits the coming Chinese temper-tantrum with great glee . They should have known the moment they told the Nobel Committee not to give < PROPFEMALE > Xiaobo the Peace Prize that the Committee could not do anything else . To do so would have been knuckling-under to authoritarians throwing their weight around . 
Keeps reminding himself to read between the lines on these Initiatives - I-1100 is vastly superior to I-1105 . 
I think Riot Games is trolling me . Apparently the name \Big Farma\ " is offensive . " 
All roads appear to lead to Evengy Morosov for my research ... 
This whole process would be so much easier if I just wanted to be a good sheep and study Chinese Political Economy ... 
1360 AP by end of game ? I do like Veigar . 
Feeling good - I just blazed through the stuff I thought would take forever . Ironically , I might find the most interesting work in my field in Africa , something I never would have guessed before . 
Not impressed by the crap on both sides about this Ayot fellow . Historical re-enactment is not ideological commitment . This is geek baiting at its worst . 
Amongst Riot's terms of profanity : \Jigglypuff\ " and \ " Big\ " . I can only presume that the company suffered some sort of traumatic incident involving monstrous Jigglypuffs produced by Japanese nuclear experiments . " 
Offhand , I'd say that hybrid Teemo is actually fairly viable . 
Cantor on the Daily Show is pretty hilarious - < PROPMALE > keeps walking all over him , and all he can do is offer talking points . 
Not particularly impressed with the President today . He could have chosen not to appeal the ruling aqgainst DADT and it would be dead for good . A political settlement would be a nice touch , but unconstitutional is a strong enough win , thank you very much . 
Dada is the world's soul . Dada is the whole point . Dada is the best < PROPFEMALE > milk soap in the world ! 
I generally know that its one of those nights when I find myself reading about the misrepresentation of Hermeticism in Full-Metal Alchemist - This time , I've avoided adding a viewing of \End of Evangelion\ " to the process . Progress has been made - I think . \ 
Indoctrination of a captive audience ? At my school ? Apparently , its more likely than you think . 
Keeps getting calls from 00 0-0 0 0-0 000 I don't answer unlisted < PROPFIRST > . I hope it's no one important . 
MSNBC apparently randomly isn't running the Maddow show tonight . Instead , we get one of the idiotic crime shows . 
MLS referee logic : if I commit a foul , and the other guy hits me for it , I get a card for him hitting me . He gets nothing . 
The depressing fact is that most of the graduate students at the best Poli Sci institutions graduated from a better undergraduate institution than me ... 
Needs to actually read the voter's guide this year - I keep getting inundated with \vote this on this\ " that tell me nothing but what the rhetoric is . " 
Having gone and read examples of statements of purpose and input on what to write - I can officially say I am more nervous now than when I started . 
4 hours of work - 1/5 of a < PROPFEMALE > of a statement of purpose . This is a great work rate ... 
I have written more compelling prose complaining about my personal statements than I have in writing them . 
One thing the Republicans may have underestimated this year is that by picking objectionable candidates and ginning up the lunatics they may be ensuring they lose in swing districts . Lots of Democrats are like me - we aren't gonna get up and wave our arms about it - but we're more determined than ever to cast our votes , because the other option is handing the nation over to grinning idiots . 
One of the things that the IP organizations seem to have ignored is that they don't UNDERSTAND the internet - the freckle-faced kids they make war on understand technology better than they do - and ultimately they are playing in our sandbox . 
Yeah - work ... That . I need to do that ... 
Okay , I give up for tonight . This is a frustrating , frustrating paper . 
I think that Seattle would have 1 or 2 more against a worse keeper . 
Ref gives Saprissa the game . Bullshit . Concacaf is still total nonsense . 
At 5 pages , I begin to realize I've said nothing nice about any of the author's I've reviewed here . This may be poor form ... 
Is going to vote no on i-1107 , and would have quietly done it on his own if the advertisements being run for it weren't so damn obnoxious . Now , I encourage ALL of you to vote against i-1107 - stopgap funding measures for the state are necessary if we want to have an education system through the course of the recovery . 
Feels like a jackass for failing to wear purple ( apparently I hadn't noticed until now that I didn't OWN anything in purple ) , but at least I managed to vote ... 
Well - that was quite possibly the worst paper I have written in my entire life . 
Wonders if a USCoC affiliated boycott could be organized ... 
Is not in a pretty mood . Would anything else like to go wrong ? I don't promise to be kind if it does . 
< PROPMALE > Schwarzenberger , < PROPFIRST > Gaines , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > Graddy , < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Greenfield , and everyone else who would like to take part : beginning below is a poetry chain - I had fun when we did this last year with < PROPFEMALE > , and I wanted to do it again . Add lines below . 
* Okay , maybe I just wanted to use T.S. < PROPMALE > in a blog post ... 
Awoke from a distinctly mediocre night of sleep to his alarm clock playing a ska reinterpretation of \Girls just wanna have fun\ " . I'm not sure how this bodes for the rest of the day . " 
Oh LoL forum participants . You so crazy . Putting so many teenage males in one place is just a bad idea . 
I show restraint , I'm the Patron Saint/ Of urban gardens in bloom/ If I don't faint ingesting paint/ Breathing all of these fumes\ 
When did Barenaked Ladies get so awesome again ? 
Done with all but uploading documents for < PROPMALE > App . This coming Week , Berkeley , MIT , and Yale . 
Is anyone else tabling to get out the vote on Monday and Tuesday ? If so , can I help out ? If not , does anyone know if I can still get a table ? 
The poor guy behind the register at Goodwill couldn't understand for the life of him why I was buying two pairs of obscenely gaudy women's reading-glasses . I looked him in the eyes , and exclaimed , \SCIENCE !!! \"" 
< PROPMALE > Salazar is an idiot . 
Around the time that Arcsine laws are applied to LoL , you know ELO hell must exist , because there's a high probability that one member of any given team is more interested in the law of large leads than in their character .... 
If you haven't voted , do it today ( or , y'know , tomorrow if you can't do it today ) , or I will sic the Grammar Nazis on you to feast on your liver ! \ 
They need the protein . 
implicit differentiation : because your problems weren't taking up enough of the < PROPFEMALE > yet . 
If I don't get in to Grad School , my advisor suggests I spend time picking up Chinese . The only problem is , the only areas I'm qualified to teach in ( the only real way to learn Chinese is to live in < PROPFEMALE > , and the only way for someone with my qualifications to get a work visa is to teach ) are things that can't be taught in < PROPFEMALE > ... 
Much of this election is going to come down to who has the best ground game . Go fucking vote . The Rethugs are gonna win the House , but there's no reason they should have a large margin there . 
If the GOP wins the House or Senate , it will mean more obstructionism , fewer jobs , less prosperity , and more trouble for you and your family . They haven't won yet - if every one of us goes out and votes , they might not win anything . Go vote , make sure your friends vote , and copy this status into your own to make sure everyone else does . 
Was the jerk up on the balcony at lunch asking people to vote . That was way harder than it looked . 
So ... The Berkeley online application for Graduate school allows you to claim citizenship in the USSR ... 
Good job , Kentucky - you have elected an anarchist . 
Wellp ... Glad I'm going to Grad School , ' cuz there ain't gonna be any jobs in this country for the next two years . 
Looks like WA and CO are going Blue . Good . < PROPMALE > Rossi will be going home , again . Maybe he'll take the hint this time . 
Watching the < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > concession speech . In the words of < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , \It ain't easy running a Ponzi scheme of stupiiiiiiid !!! \ " \ 
Why are all the best courses Scholarly and Creative Inquiry courses that I can't take ? Not cool ! 
< PROPMALE > Tutu will be in Tacoma in mid-late May ... Perhaps we can try to convince the school to ask him to come speak here ? Maybe even for graduation ? 
Has applied to Graduate School . The hellfest is over . Now , let the nail-biting begin !!! 
There's something somewhat counterintuitive about citing information to ( Wrong , ##) in a paper , regardless of the fact that that is the author's name ... 
Has seen far too many parallels between the Odyssey and Tolkien . Also , has confirmed his thesis that epic myth is , in fact , a story of travelling to progressively larger houses . 
The realization that what I had written was not merely 8 lines of rhymed couplets , incapable of further expansion , but also ballad-form , gave me my first taste of what a mid-life crisis might feel like . \ 
Worse yet ... The poem was good . 
Had a bizzare dream about an extended civil war between Bellevue and Seattle which involved some of the weirdest , but occasionally most awesome , military technology I have ever seen ... I'm still trying to figure out why my subconscious put tank treads on the battleships , though . 
There is something fundamentally wrong with me , when I see a billboard decrying plagiarism ( Auto-correct wanted to put Platonism here ) and want to argue with it , simply because the rhetoric is so exploitative ... 
Wait ... < PROPFIRST > O'Donnell ... Explaining basic economics to idiots ? Beautiful , but probably not worth the time . 
The cat-food omission fails . Spelling intended . 
< PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Greenfield's birthday dinner is tomorrow at 5:30 pm . Meet at our house to go ( I may need more drivers than me if too many people show up ) . 
Is dumb , which is why he's taking a 400 level math course with only one semester of calculus .. 
Aasif Mandvi's new film preview has made me somewhat homesick for South Harrow . 
Hmm ... well , the new anti-depressant certainly is an interesting experience ... 
Accidentally succeeded at a lab he was supposed to fail at ... 
Well - we missed out on the power outage . Good news . 
Wrote a poem entitled \National Call in Slick Day\ " . It's pretty fucking awesome . " 
Totally fucking bombed his calculus test . Fuck related rates and conic segments . 
The USMNT has a bright future , if today's game was any indication . Agudello , Rogers , Ream , and Diskerud had a stellar showing . 
Got in at Crosscurrents , with the poem he liked least . Well , I'll take the victory . 
Is still an asshole , despite what some people seem to believe ... 
Managed to turn critiques on photography into a poem which tied the Odyssey to Rwanda and the French Revolution ... I'm not sure if I'm proud or disgusted ... 
Watching < PROPFIRST > Beck's attack on Soros made me cry for the state of education in the US ... 
In some ways has come to believe that the fundamental norms of D&D have more connection to Greek Hero Myth than to \fantasy\ " ( if any good articulation can be given to the genre ) . " 
Has found that there is an area in political science that is even too gory for him . Genocide studies are fucking torturous . 
The cost of having done the reading I was going to do today last night is that now I have nothing to do , thanks to my efficiency . 
Isn't quite sure why integration showed up in the problems for the section on Mean Value Theorem , but isn't going to argue with easy work ... 
I hate seeing Conner < PROPFIRST > score ... 
God Dammit ! I'm gonna be so mad if the Crapids win the MLS Cup . 
Is getting his soccer nerd on in preparation for the expansion draft . 
Nkufo unprotected ... Weird . 
Can't say he likes this wind . It is pulling the heat out of his room like nothing else . 
Brolaf is coming to the league ... Victory . 
No class . Break starts a day early , I guess . Unfortunately , closed campus means sub is closed too , I think , so I'm responsible for me own food . Good thing I went shopping . 
Is bored and would like to do something . Unfortunately , it is fucking cold . 
Palin : We have to stand beside our North Korean allies . \ 
Really , lady ? Please go back to Alaska and stay there ... 
Di Caprio is doing a film adaptation of Brave New World ... I am not sure how I feel about this . 
About that sleep ... Yeah ... 
loves wasting time on unnecessarily complex math problems which teach little to nothing in the realm of the important , and serve only the purpose of allowing the math department to over-schedule its courses compared to the rest of the school ... 
Thinks that < PROPFIRST > Fagles might be translating his works with the express intention of making his task easier ... Lattimore's closing of the Odyssey may be more faithful , though ... 
Found chords for < PROPFIRST>'s Jerusalem , and has found that he can get harpsichord voicing out of his guitar for the chord changes . It is awesome . 
Has forgotten about 2/3rds of all of his forms ... Self , I am disappoint . \ 
That's what 4 years of not practicing will do to you . 
Sleep , apparently , is for those people who aren't on dopamine reuptake inhibitors ... Suffice to say , I am disappoint . 
As glad as I am for < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE>'s involvement in the 2022 WC bid , I was deeply annoyed by his white-washing of American immigration history ... 
Bah . Qatar 2022 ... FIFA , I am disappoint . 
What did the red giant say before it went supernova ? \Well ... This is ironic . \"" 
Reading Easterly is a little like watching a blind man attempting to board a train that just pulled out . He knows the damn thing is there , and he knows how to get on , but he seems to have missed a rather critical detail . 
Tomorrow , 6 pages of Chinese-African relations and 40 math problems ... And if I finish that , I need to go read Euripides ... 
=/ Pick up your phone , Cellar ! Blue student needs food badly ! 
Is floating in a sea of Eximbank loans , structural readjustment policies , HIPC processes , and Special Economic Zones . I love this topic , but I feel like I've been beaten over the head with a 2 by 4 . 
Finished the damn paper . One paper , two tests , and 2 sections of math remain , then I am done . 
Only the Democrats could lose a game of poker where they held all the cards . Yay for billions more in debt because of conservative economic bullshit ! Wooooooo .... 
I thought of you when the shut down the school/And the hospital too . 
It stands to reason that the paper handed out today , the last paper for this semester , and really the only specific work I have left to do , would be the paper I least < PROPFEMALE > to write ... 
Wishes , if just for a second , that he could have been an astrophysicist ... 
Made war upon Plato in a classics course today . The Professor was somewhat underwhelmed ... 
So much game design !!! 
The odd comradery of drunks is a marvelous thing to behold . In the allowance of transgression , they generate a new kind of social capital . Constructed on the basis of shared ( drunken ) identity , they create bonding capital where only bridging was possible before . Dionysus , perhaps , is not so dead . 
Told you so ... 
Thank you < PROPFIRST > Sanders . 
WAS going to sleep - that seems much less likely now . 
So - Why haven't we done this nuclear pulse propulsion stuff ? 
Definitively proved that 1 = 0 on his Calculus exam . Not a good sign ... 
Apparently Judge Hudson misread the sign : It's \Virginia is for lovers\ " not \ " Virginia is for losers . \"" 
Quits the left . Progressive have started saying it is a good thing that HCR didn't win in the Bush Jr. court in < PROPFEMALE > ... Because it wasn't liberal enough . Fucking halfwits . 
Begun this Internet war has ... ( Also .... srsly - xkcd has it right in the alt text today ... ) 
Done with the semester . Yay . Now I just need to clean my room and pack my shit ... So I should be done by the start of next semester . 
Ends the semester with 1337 meal points remaining . Victory ? I believe so . 
DADT dead . One more nail in the coffin of hate . 
For better or for worse , Redmond is my teenage wasteland , and it is never easy for me to come back here . 
Work , work , work , work ... The only thing that keeps me sane is work . 
Has copies of the Deed of Paksenarion . Is beginning to form concepts for characters in Glass ... 
Oh Nerf Herder ... \You don't want a boyfriend/What you want is Mr. Spock \"" 
First two games vs LA Galaxy and NY Red Bulls four days apart . We're gonna have a hell of a start to this season . Also - not P**tland or Vancouver ? 
The great tragedy of our struggle with our weight , culturally , is that we are going about it the wrong way . There is one thing we all need to hear : you will < PROPFEMALE > ( and thus eat ) the same WEIGHT of food every day . It is the content of that weight that you can vary . Eat until you're full , but eat apples instead of pizza . I wish someone had told me sooner . This is a hell of a lot easier than fighting a losing battle . 
Is taking bets on how long it takes some Senator to go all < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > on < PROPFIRST > Kyl ( R - Asshole ) . The man is a slimeball who verges on treason with his bullshit excuses about the START treaty . 
Blessed Solstice , all . 
Has spent the evening learning parts of old futhark runes . As a result , I appear to have picked up quite a few inscriptions of ' alu ' and ' erilaz ' on me . Bind-runes are also freaking incredible ! Futhark - the only script where tttttt is considered a magic word ... 
Apparently my newfound insomnia is being caused by some malevolent irony spirit . I woke up from a dream where I fought with a Congressman over whether American Idiot was better or worse than the less-well-known Armenian Idiot , which considered the life of \Jesus of Caucasia\ " as he struggled with his alter-ego \ " Saint Jude\ " ... I'd rather be sleeping . " 
The next time I get the brilliant idea to play a card game with my family , someone stop me ... 
Has officially reached the point where solitude ceases to be its own reward ... Damn - early this year . 
Also supports boycotting Thor - not for its casting of a black man as Heimdal ( Oh no ! Racial inaccuracies in a movie about a comic that TEEMS with inaccurate representations ! ) , but for being based on the most retarded comic < PROPFEMALE > has ever produced ... Ever . 
Is safely ensconced in his room with a copy of Reza Aslan's anthology of Middle Eastern literature . 
Jones = Mut/Sekhmet ? Wut ? 
Hn ... Shakespeare had this problem where he liked to confuse < PROPFEMALE > and Welsh myth apparently . This does not make the fine < PROPMALE > of allusion any easier . 
I wrote ' massacre ' in red-pen at the pity party ball/Slipping over syllabaries to the monophonic fall . /Making conversation whole cloth from nothing much at all/I was a neologic masochist heading for a stall . 
Is nearly done with the document he said he'd have done by the end of this week ... For those of you waiting on the Altheus overview , I swear I'm nearly done . Once I finish the schools , I'm just gonna devote a < PROPFEMALE > to politics and a < PROPFEMALE > to common antagonists . It should only come out to about 25 < PROPFEMALE > s single-spaced . I'm getting paid for this , right ? Right ?! :P 
3 - 0 ! How's that feel , < PROPFEMALE > ? 
Well , the brief history of Altheus has become the not so brief history of Altheus ... This probably bodes poorly . 
How the fuck did I GET this many books in my room . Halfway through the 700 or so books in my room . o.o 
Birmingham has been hurting Man U pretty good right now ... 
There is apparently a thriving traditional < PROPFEMALE > music scene in Serbia ... National identity can be such a weird thing sometimes . 
Managed a whole two paragraphs of work today before writer's block hit him like a ton of bricks . This will all be done some time ... I hope . 
Dammit Gabe ! Stop showing me up as a GM !! 
Bullshit draw with Wigan . A nonsense pen in the first half and the failure to award a pen when a defender in the wall blocks a free kick with his hands ... 
For those of you who haven't had the < PROPMALE > to experience it - Fable 3 is quite good , thank you very much . 
It's probably a bad thing when you wake up from a dream and find yourself arguing with your brain over its chosen neologisms . 
Likes < PROPMALE > MacMath or Kofi Sarkodie for the Sounder's first round pick-up in the Super Draft , if at all possible . 
Never thought he would utter the phrase : \Uh ... Dad ? You're on fire . \"" 
Facebook killed my last status ... Short form : I want to see a few games out of the AFC Asian Cup this week . For some reason , folks are saying that Qatar ( a team which FIFA does not rate highly ) is likely to advance out of group . They are in the easiest group in the tourney , mind - but I don't think home field advantage means crap when you're 114 on FIFA ratings . 
Has no idea how he is going to get back on a sane or normal sleep schedule after today . 
\Hurrah my lads for freedom/Let's all join hearts and hands/May the Lord have mercy on the souls/of the boys who smashed the van\ " ( points to anyone who actually recognizes the piece ) " 
Sometimes wonders just what good his degree will do him - given its relatively obscure nature . 
Has a distinguished top hat , ladies and gentlemen . It looks wonderful with my new overcoat . Now all I need is an excessively gaudy walking-stick . 
Has new , steam-punkish glasses . 
< PROPFIRST > Boehner : I hope he fails . We don't need Oompa-loompas in Washington . 
Apparently the dice really like this NPC ... o.o 2 18s and 2 17s in the same set ... 
< PROPFIRST > Boehner - Why do you want to kill me ? 
The < PROPFIRST > Bragg in the new Protest the Hero studio update makes my world feel very small ... 
Would like to firmly object to any snow in the next week . I need to drive back to Tacoma next week , and I do not want to do it in the snow ! 
Is heartsick at the attack on Congresswoman Giffords . My thoughts and prayers go out to the family and friends of all of the victims . 
Did not need the family gallbladder problems to crop up now ... 
Offhand , I'm willing to hazard a guess that \We can't seem to find your right kidney\ " is not something the nurse practitioner got to say very much ... \"" 
Typical evergreen medical ... I've been waiting 30 minutes in the lobby ... 
Is beyond angry . 
Stoked for the MLS Superdraft tomorrow . Probably alone in that feeling - but I'm used to that . 
Only my closet remains to be cleaned ... Of course , I dread doing that - but such is life . 
Ah ... Facebook - again you manage to violate my privacy without asking . The only reason you get away with this is that there is no viable contender . Bastards . 
Saw something that mixed the poetic with the tragic . A homeless man sat with a plastic container , selling plants from the roadside . Above him , someone had plastered a pair of < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > stickers . 
Safely at campus in his room - which is now even more cluttered than before . 
Just realized the < PROPFEMALE > in the bottom right of Treatise 3 of Gunnerkrigg Court is a hand . Significant ? 
Had the longest , and quite possibly strangest , dream he has ever had ... 
Doesn't know what time his seminar today starts - could be 4:00 , could be 3:30 ... =/ 
Boxplot , I am disappoint . 
Having read all of Iron Heroes through , now , my only complaint is that you should gain more feats ( and that there should be even more variation in the feats ! ) . It's an awesome concept that should be taken further . 
Pre-algebraic math is painful ... 
Wonders who chose the < PROPMALE > in his house ... the symbolism borders on the obscene . 
And riot announces that it is getting rid of the only part of LoL I can use to practice without having to put up with anonymous asshats . Thanks - I think I'm done . 
The best part of being a PG < PROPMALE > ? Reading account of 19th century gunbattles between voluntary firefighting organizations . 
What is amazing is that we have become a culture so overwrought with populist sentiment that facts and expert opinions are no longer relevant to decision making . Don't like something ? Just lie about it loud enough and all the evidence in the world is inadequate . If democracy means subjecting ourself to mass stupidity in order to fulfill the unreachable ideal of a truly free society , then it really isn't worth it . 
Whoop - Well ... Guess I'm done watching MSNBC ... It's a sad day when one of the few honest ( if bombastic ) members of the media is forced out and replaced by a word-mincing Washington insider ... < PROPFIRST > O'Donnell just isn't equal to the gap he's been asked to fill . 
I may have broke my players a little ... Did they come with warranties ? 
God dammit , research opportunities ! Why must you crop up when I am busy with other things !? 
Right , this is why I never learned to juggle with a soccer ball ... I suck at it and look silly . 
Huntington was stupid enough in text form ... In lecture form , he's no less wrong . 
Take 6 of one poem ... At least this is really only an edit , rather than a complete rewrite ... The final product had better be worth it . 
Ultimate Combat playtest ? Don't mind if I do ! 
Lunch or League Cup semis ... A difficult question indeed . 
K - so , I think that my Senior Thesis is being written in the streets of Egypt and Tunisia ... Not what I was expecting . 
Didn't watch the Republican response , but can summarize it anyway . \HERP !!! DERP !!! \"" 
The President gave a decent , if somewhat right of center , State of the Union Address . That , ladies and gentlemen , is what a responsible conservative looks like . Republicans , take note . Tea Partiers ? Take exlax . It might get the stupid stick out of your asses . 
Wednesdays are the cruelest day ... 
Ah - a manic streak . Just what I wanted . 
Every trip to the mail room seems to provoke a new and more fascinating personal crisis . Shoes , today - not grad school acceptance - but I still had my heart in my throat waiting for the package . 
May be one of the few people in the world who can use 4chan as a legitimate research source . 
To go to class or continue to observe the situation in Egypt ? 
Cutting class to watch Al-Jazeera . 
Needs a tool to record segments of the livestream he is watching for citation purposes ? 
It's gonna be one of those days . 
Stiff Little Fingers - I had forgotten how much I missed them . 
Meeting at 6:00 in the SUB for < PROPMALE>'s b-day dinner ( a day late ) - if you'd like to join us , please do ( although car space is limited - sorry ) . 
Listened to the Colbert interview of Chua and is eating crow . She knows she was wrong ... Well - there you are . 
I'm sick of all this Dionysian romance/I want my freedom and I don't wanna dance 
O.o Google maps is broked . 
It feels really cool to be doing mathematics off of the Rhind papyrus ... Even if it is really screwed up . 
< PROPFIRST > Fukuyama : still wrong about everything . ( From 2004 ) \It seems that Afghanistan has more reasons for hope ( than Iraq ) . \"" 
Would go to the store ... But there is no space left in the refrigerator . 
May well have just earned the eternal damnation of the poetry gods for that pun ... 
And now , the desperate paring down of beloved poems in order to submit merely 3 to Crosscurrents . 
Is a huge fan of the new UEFA financial rules . I don't want total parity like MLS ( although I understand the current need ) , but I think it's stupid that clubs can go billions into debt and avoid the process of developing their own talent . With any luck , the < PROPFEMALE > Yankees-style soccer monopolies is over . I'm looking at you Barca . 
Arsenal 0 - Everton 1 - I'm not sure if I'm watching soccer , or a mugging . Arsenal may be the more skillful side , but Everton ( with some help from the officials ) are walking all over them - literally , actually . < PROPFIRST > Song , Djourou , and Sagna have all taken hard hits . 
Blessed Imbolc and all that . May Brigit's fire inspire our < PROPFEMALE > . 
And there goes the peaceful part . 
Grumble grumble ... stupid small ups torture desks broke my pedometer ... 
< PROPFIRST > fukuyama - master of argument from false pretenses ... 
ICE seized atdhe ... The new money-wasting drug war is the war on piracy . Fuck's sake ... 
Appears to have accidentally traumatized a raccoon . I'm fairly certain it thought I was stalking it by the end of our odd , coinciding walk . It was not pleased , since I was between it and food . 
Is being lazy and leaving his analysis of Fukuyama until Sunday - fact is , I hated the book . It mixes useless and factless in a mire of half-conclusions and pretty ( but empty ) rhetoric . 
Didn't get in to < PROPMALE > . I hope that this isn't the first of many rejections . 
Enjoys having his cynicism reaffirmed . It's a wonderful mix of nihilistic despair and the triumphant glee of being proved right . 
Apparently , I've bypassed denial and gone straight to anger . What a wonderful 24 hours I'm having ... 
Rush Limpdick says we ought to back Mubarak . Stupid AND Evil - just how I like my Republicans . 
< PROPFIRST > Gaines and I were a psychological wrecking crew tonight . Many nightmares were born at our hands . 
Probably too much of a soccer geek when you start comparing and contrasting the strategic structure of Sigi's Arrow and Wenger's offense . Nevertheless , I have free time , apparently . 
< PROPFIRST > Donne and JFK have clashed in my head and produced monstrous progeny . \Ask not what your country can do for you ... It tolls for you . \ " Road construction is a big deal . " 
Was merely pretending to be running high fantasy ... It was horror all along . 
Having been on the Pelosi mailing list apparently means I am now on the Boehner speaker's list . What a pity - I don't need my IQ sapped any more than it already is . 
Found a typo in a text he was reading where the term \Philantrophist\ " was used . I am afraid ! " 
Spent the evening doing game design stuff . Altheus may yet be the coolest system I have made ... 
No class today ... Gonna concentrate on not coughing up a lung ... 
Being a good plague-bearer and hiding in my cave . 
Dreamed strange things , including a rapping Greek scholar : \Dressed up and all scholarly/A few books will not bother me/Alexandria's majesty/'til the Caesars get mad at me/All the scholars falla ' me/But you can call me Ptolemy . \"" 
So - I wake up from fever dreams and take medicine , suspecting I won't fall back asleep ... And I see an advertisement for , \Dress up < PROPFEMALE > Palin . \ " I think I preferred the nightmares ... ( Who the hell comes up with these things ?! ) " 
Just realized the ultrasound image used in the MSNBC \Lean Forward\ " advertisement is footage from the music video of \ " Walls\ " by Crass ( I do not recommend looking this up if you are weak of constitution ) very carefully edited . I'm not sure if this is a case of an intern sneaking in a prank or just stock footage ... " 
Really likes watching the Iranian national team - they may not be high rated , but they have excellent ball control . 
I feel fine .... As long as I don't try breathing . Going to CHWS tomorrow . 
You want my values-system/inscribed on your skin ? Written in permanent pen/so it can leach into your veins/And turn your heart as black as mine ? 
Ogee ! 
Mubarak stepping down ? Good , but the VP isn't much better . 
Bad news - I have bronchitis ... Good news , the inhaled steroid they gave me is goooood ... 
Hey Trump - you're fired from public life for being a fucktard . CPAC is the only place you can get away with birther bullshit . 
Is becoming quite fond of < PROPMALE > Jazeera . The discussions on Riz Kahn are incredibly in depth and intelligent . It's like REAL news ... 
Grats , Egypt . Now , unfortunately , comes the hard part . Getting democracy is easier than sustaining it . Best of luck . 
The only problem with reading a really good book is that sometimes I really want to talk with the author to cross-examine them and get into their head . Worse yet - there are times when I want to pull in people who haven't read the book just to get them to offer counterpoints . This may be my favorite book in political science , ever ( and , as a result , it is taking me 4 or 5 times longer than it ought to read it ) . 
Oh < PROPFEMALE > Arcade . \I want them tried in the Hague ! \"" 
Um - that's a lot of hail ... o.o 
Father ... please bless this fruit bowl ... o.o 
My to do list seems to get longer every day . Maybe world domination will have to wait until after I graduate ... 
Had a productive meeting and really does love his field . Even when it drives him spare . 
Perhaps I should have bronchitis more often ... 
So ... iran ? Yeah - maybe my thesis isn't done ... 
Japanese is cancelled for tomorrow , so I get to watch the Barcelona-Arsenal game instead ! 
What sucks about my Tuesdays : by the time I get home , everyone else has already had dinner , and so I am left to go eat alone . 
Montana friends : You are the only state from which both Senators voted AGAINST re-authorizing the Patriot Act . Grats . 
I get the feeling that this is going to be a painful 90 minutes ... 
< PROPFIRST > PERSIE !!!!!!!!! 
Arsenal wins . Barcelona may be the \best team in the world\ " - but they didn't look so pretty today . =D " 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is my new favorite person , because she knows who Tristian Tzara is . 
And a 30 < PROPFEMALE > introduction to a political science text manages to trigger an academic existential crisis . Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu . 
must shamefacedly admit he's forgotten how to solve cubic equations ... 
Gives up . Fuck this stupid fucking assignment . Fuck Pythagoras and fuck Archimedes , and particularly fuck fucking Euclid !!! 
Kinda wants to see other Unions go wildcat over the bullshit attacks on public worker's unions in Teabagger states . 
From steinmo's Evolution of Modern States : \A funny thing happened on Japan's way to the US model ; it never got there . \"" 
Did not get in to Yale . Two chances left . 
So - basically , I never thought I would discuss speciation and the state in a paper , but I find this argument so fascinating right now . 
Finished math homework ... After 7 hours of work on the damn assignment . This was excessive . 
Reminder to those who would like to return us to the 19th century : liberals won for a reason : all the Pinkertons in the world won't face down a riot . We live in an age of peaceful politics . Take away the peaceful methods of negotiations and the norms of reciprocal democracy and you will reap the whirlwind . 
Also , a friendly reminder from my friend Auden : There is no such thing as the State . 
Oh - maybe I didn't mean to wake up quite this late ... 
New Library website = has real problems . Getting a list of call < PROPFIRST > is a pain in the ass ! 
Just came to the realization that he has no fucking clue what to do with himself if he doesn't get into grad school ... 
14 pounds in the last month . I rather like this . 
Half a < PROPFEMALE > of work on a book ... That's progress , right ? 
Cannot get his old Zune to work and it is pissing him off . 
I realize that there is nothing good about this statement , but I just cannot imagine a man who looks as SILLY as Gadhafi actually managing effective evil ... 
Zune is such a smarmy piece of shit . 
Working Zune and homework - not a bad combination . 
Currently being amazed by the complexity of ancient Chinese mathematics - much of the math we attribute to the Arab world was done in ancient or medieval Chinese texts . 
Had forgotten the great fun of having an MP3 player - walking along , smiling along to an upbeat Chumbawamba song with vicious anti-social lyrics is all sorts of fun . \We don't go to God's house any more/Saw the light and walked right out the door/We don't go to God's house/It's more fun in the doghouse/We don't go to God's house any more . \"" 
Snow fail . 
Level up session at 830 in the sub . 
With all due repect , Governor < PROPMALE > ( none ) , go fuck yourself . 
Hopes his last class is cancelled , because he has no plans to show up . 
Needs to get himself a Wisconsin T-shirt ... 
Hates fasting blood tests ... Sooooo shaky . ( didn't help that they took 3 vials ) 
Has mysteriously lost his copy of Bottom Billion . Fuck . 
Ouch . 
Only I could end up breaking a knuckle because I was dumb enough to dance on ice . Thank you to the random passer-bye who checked to see if the dumbass on the ground was alright ... 
Rejected by mit . 
In a piss-poor mood , but I do have a pretty fucking cool paper topic for my final paper in History of Math : The Mathimagics of < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , and Cardano 
Would you rather be the architect of what we might create ? / Don't you remember when you were young ? / And you wanted to set the world on fire ? / Somewhere deep down , I know you do . / And all you remember when we were young/How we wanted to set the world on fire/Because I still am and I still do 
Playing an insane character is too easy when one is already out of whack ... 
Coming back from the solidarity rally in Olynpia . Good turn out , given the weather . 5000 pro-union protesters there . 200 tea baggers . 
So proud of the workers in Wisconsin . I'm a cynic , but they do give me some hope that we aren't all fucked . Solidarity . 
The program I was using to view images from the protests had the phrase \embiggen\ " in it ... o.o " 
Probably should spend time collecting encyclopedic knowledge of something of actual use . Being able to tell real Anon from fake Anon isn't going to get me employed ... 
Just cannot get excited by this book . It has its moments , but then I just want to fall asleep . 
Good morning , world ... 
A public union employee , a tea party activist , and a CEO are sitting at a table with a plate of a dozen cookies in the middle of it . \ 
The CEO takes 11 cookies , turns to the tea partier and says , ' Watch out for that union guy . He wants a piece of your cookie . ' 
< PROPFIRST > Tzara - the poetry anonymous would write - if it wrote poetry . 
Still hasn't heard from Berkeley - I hope that this is a good sign ... 
My printer is determined to make sure I am always late to writer's guild ... 
Cannot manage to get to the \awake\ " point this morning ... " 
Fails . 
Frustrated and aimless , again . The employment world is bullshit . You wanna do something useful ? Go get job experience doing something useless . Fuck that noise . Starvation , here I come ... 
Fuck you UC Berkeley - sending me a new version of your rejection letter to replace a 1 with a 2 in one date was neither necessary nor kind . 
This next year is gonna suck ass . 
As Ohio nicely demonstrates - Republicans remain stupid , evil . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > - not merely a thug and a bastard , but also a criminal . 
Just found out that during the voice recording of the last scene of End of < PROPFEMALE > , the voice actor for Shinji started to strangle the voice actress for Asuka ... Apparently , it wasn't just the audience who were driven to madness by the show . 
Shinji influenced character for Glass this summer ? Don't mind if do . 
You ran out of ink , too , Didn't you , you bastards ? 
Game session resurrection , go ! Pulling miracles out of my ass is a skill , I guess ... 
Ugh ... Well - we almost managed a draw . -_- 
Has got to stop writing ' iro ' when he means ' iru ' ... so far as I know , discussion-colored people are , at best , a synesthetic metaphor . 
Sick of right wing cry-babies and their enablers . Poor babies have to be afraid of paying another million dollars in taxes . I've got so much fucking sympathy . 
Still working on giving a shit . I've not had a whole lot of reasons to feel < PROPFEMALE > towards the world recently . 
From too few options to too many ... o.o 
Made it about 10 minutes into a Japanese language copy of Pokemon White before giving up the ghost and accepting that his language skills were note quite at the level they needed to be at for him to play in Japanese ( and that's even without Kanji to make things worse ! ) ... 
In a just world , Wisconsin would look like Cairo , right now ... 
Endgame leaked . I have good walking music for the day . 
September's Children may be the best song Rise Against has ever written . 
Time for a general strike . Shut it all down . 
A war fought on debt is , by nature , a war without appreciable costs . 
< PROPFEMALE > t of Gundam : Unicorn is brilliant , with the homages to 2010 and < PROPFEMALE > Wars . Also - prime case for \what I watched ; what I expected ; what I saw \"..." 
Goldilocks ' discovery of < PROPMALE>'s method for approximation required surprisingly few changes . Also , Dad ? Why didn't I get badass fairytale-math lectures ? I feel robbed . <3 XKCD 
Sleeping in a room that used to be mine ... weird . 
Tank < PROPFEMALE > is best < PROPFEMALE > ... right ? 
Almost forgot to wear black . Happy St. Cultural Genocide day , everyone ! 
That was a lot less painful than I expected ... Why are you playing with me , math homework ? 
Does anyone know who stole my sinuses and replaced them with heating coils ? 
Reading amateur fantasy authors is a wonderful experience for the ironically inclined . I am absolutely tickled pink by the idea of \hot cacao\ " ( indubitably less pleasant than the heavily processed hot cocoa that can be made from it ) and \ " magic castors\ " ( I presume that these magical beavers are quite rare ) . " 
Nice weather , good sports - oh look , we just started combat operations ... Boy is the cognitive dissonance getting to me . 
Things I never thought I'd see in the MLS : < PROPFIRST > Keller with a beautiful save on a penalty from < PROPFIRST > . 
Losing to the two best teams in the league in the first two games of the season is cold comfort when you are 0-2-0 with no goals . 
Introduction , introduction , introduction , intro - this is really bland text ... 
Missing the crosscurrents first deadline is only made worse by the fact that I still have to engage in the excruciating process of selecting only three poems for submission . 
The upside is - my introduction looks a hell of a lot like Morozov's ... the downside is : he beat me to it . 
Probably gave the most negative Senior Survey of all those asked to take it - but can you blame me ? 
Would be willing to teach civics at the High School level - if he were allowed to teach it in a way that actually taught anything . As its taught in most classrooms ? Sorry , not interested . I prefer to think most High School seniors are capable of finding their own asses , thank you very much . 
Listening to < PROPMALE > Markey ( D-Mass ... ive idiot ) talk out of his ass about nuclear power ... What a self-righteous twit . 
< PROPFIRST > Kucinich : also still stupid ... 
New Protest the Hero album only a week and a half after the new Rise Against album ? Don't mind if I do ... 
Is wearing size 42 pants for the first time in half of a decade . This is good news , heavily balanced by the fact that walking in said jeans is something of a production ... 
Scientology ads while reading Daily Kos ... Ick . 
Any classical economist should reject trickle-down economics by finishing the second chapter of their economics textbook . The problem of diminishing returns ought to apply ... But facts are hard , philosophies are easy . 
Kinda wishes he could go see Rise Against and Bad Religion on the 12th ... 
Well - lyric editing sessions are a hell of a lot more productive after a year of writing primarily poetry . Pity I haven't actually written a song in a year . 
The more one reads about < PROPFIRST > Orwell , the less one likes him . 
Apparently weather.com has decided to give me my weather in Chinese . Well - I guess practice is a good thing . 
So - cool story , bro - the paper I thought was going to be incredibly banal has become a really fascinating paper thanks to a change in thesis . Euclid may be my new favorite mathematician ( not for his work - but for everyone else's work around his ) . 
surprisingly productive at 1 in the morning . 
It never ceases to amaze me that we misunderstand most of the political liberalism ( classical - not us political ) we enjoy as something older than the last half century . 
< PROPMALE > has been incredibly lucky , so far . 
Is this city actually cursed ? Is this the only possible explanation ? 
Seattle may be the worst good soccer team I have ever seen ... This is utterly pathetic ! 
RIP < PROPFEMALE > Lamb . You will always be my favorite super-spy . 
Just realized that he needs soccer gear for this spring ... Finding size 16 training cleats ... fuuuuuuuu . 
Oh right - I'm supposed to start a blog on gaming . That's what I was going to do . Strange special segments are popping into my head , but continuous content is what is needed . Blah . 
Why is the England Ghana game only available in French ? 
Another pair of headphones irrevocably destroyed by the inexplicable mechanism of headphone entropy . I swear to gods I'm cursed ... 
Thanks , Phi Beta Kappa . =D 
Sun , why do you rise so early ? Why is half of my room windows ? Why can I no longer sleep past 7:00 ... -_- 
Needs to acquire a copy of the Phantom Toll Booth . 
Still needs to chose and edit a poem for the Handy . It's a pity that \Greetings from the Valium Generation\ " is the wrong tone for the English Department ... " 
Vaguely frustrated that it doesn't count as doing significant work on his thesis to gather a whole lot of data ... 
Just unmotivated . Must at least convince myself to do laundry ... 
Ogee , I wonder why Iraq is such an outlier in terms of internet use ... < PROPMALE > , you're a goddamn idiot . 
Lazy Sunday , wake up in the late aftern- fuck , I have 5 pages of thesis due tomorrow . 
Who needs sleep ? 
The fucking gremlins have gone from driving my hair crazy to stealing my shit . I have now lost a Japanese book and my comb . Where the fuck do combs disappear to ? 
Fell asleep in class ... Fuck the sunlight at 6:00 in the bloody morning ... 
Does not understand how a comb can magically disappear . A better prank could not have been thought up if someone had invested hours in it . 
Oh right ... THAT'S what being in shape looks like . Got a while to go there , < PROPMALE > . =/ 
Hey , look at that , election season just started already ! It's like a political Thanksgiving that lasts a year and a half with your grumpy neighbors at the table . 
Well , what do you know ? I spend 2 years trying to avoid going to UW , and I'm gonna spend the next year doing NDE there to build a resume . < PROPFEMALE > sigh . 
< PROPMALE > Schwarzenberger : I'm experimenting with form like you suggested and producing terrible post-modern drivel . I hope you're proud of yourself ! ( I should make you read it just to punish you . ) 
Well - it would have been nicer for Kloppenburg to win going away , but at least she looks to have narrowly edged Prosser in the first count . Given where she was a month ago , that is good news . 
Restating the fundamental theorem : as above so below as below , so above . 
Watching the weirdest soccer game he has ever seen . 3 red cards , so far . None of them deserved . 
Sadly , the Gunnerkrigg glyph is not < PROPFIRST>'s monad , as I had hoped it was . 
Wisconsin Republicans steal election with transparent fraud ? Smells like it ! 
My comb randomly appeared in my desk . I have fucking Gremlins . Only explanation . 
Lerich is the most frustrating author I have ever read . Every < PROPFEMALE > requires five minutes of decoding and getting at its meaning and then , half way through , he decides that he needs to make structuralism MAKE SENSE ! Worse , he succeeds . What has been seen can not be unseen . =/ 
Heidegger is stalking me again ... 
Whether or not he actually said it , Foucault is my new hero for allegedly dubbing Derrida's writing \Obscurant terrorism \"." 
<3 A Calculated Use of Sound . I still have a hard time choosing between it and Kezia for my favorite PTH album . 
The fact that Open Office corrects differance to difference makes me unreasonably happy . 
Rethugs promise to hold debt limit hostage for their retarded philosophy ... Morons . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > is an intensely fascinating character - but I see so many scholars ' readings of him as being flawed by failing to view < PROPFIRST > as a full human , not one divided into mathematician one day and magician the next . It is really frustrating to have an author provide clear evidence that the same Neoplatonism that motivated him in magic motivated him in science and then say the opposite ... 
Google's < PROPFEMALE > to force me to unify my personal and professional life in their blog system really pisses me off . 
My blog already has readers from Ireland and Poland . How cool is that ? ( don't tell me if you just happen to have a proxy based in Ireland or Poland . I will be sad . ) 
< PROPMALE > Schwarzenberger < PROPMALE > Pembroke Kahn I'm planning on leaving for < PROPFEMALE > at about 4:45 pm ( adding an extra 15 minutes to the drive for traffic ) . Do you mind meeting at my house ? 
In Cardano's \Book of my life\ " chapter 42 is his section on prophecy . Make of this what you will . " 
Is very glad the President stood up to fight today rather than surrendering on the most important issues before us . 
Hmm ... This paper is short of what I would like . =/ 
So groggy ... 
Bleh . I've hit the awkward point in Japanese where the only way I'm going to get better is by discussion ... and i don't have anyone to practice with . 
< PROPMALE > Pembroke Kahn < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > Phend < PROPMALE > Schwarzenberger < PROPMALE > Schmidtlein < PROPMALE > Wright Game is at 7:00 tomorrow . I'd like to use the chem room , but if we can't , the conference room from last time is great . 
< PROPFIRST > Trump is not running for office - < PROPFIRST > Trump is running for attention . 
Things which piss me off : MLS game day blackouts when I don't own a television and the cellar doesn't open until 4:00 . 
Doesn't get to eat . Bah . 
Draw , but one that we had to fight like hell for . Yay ! 
Altheus has been all sorts of fun for me . < PROPMALE > thanks to all of my players for enabling my epic habit . 
In what is neither entirely surprising nor as obvious as it seems , goals for and goals against are strongly ( p = about . 04 ) correlated in < PROPMALE > League Soccer . 
Oh Homestuck . You never fail to confuse me . 
My house is possessed . Random smoke detector symphonies while I try to sleep . Panic attack re : carbon monoxide ensues . Fuck everything . 
Fuck the smoke detectors in this house . Now I'm completely awake and terrified . Again . 
Waking up is hard to do ... 
Bury the Hatchet is swiftly becoming my new favorite pth song for the amazing hell unleashed in the second repetition of \I swear I have compassion . \"" 
In the uncomfortable period of waiting to edit a blog post . Would like to get it out the door . 
Fuck the library website . Obvious button to reserve book ? No . No button ! But , its okay - if you request a book , the Professor holding it has to return it . Too bad you can't request it ! 
Being informed that since I am one of the students who is furthest along , I need to present my paper for edits on Tuesday is a distinctly mixed feeling . On one hand , it is gratifying . On the other , why < PROPMALE > ? Why ? I was at the point where I was almost done with hell week , and you added two more days !!! >.< 
Crosscurrents accepts my least favorite piece of all my submissions again . Well , at least I managed to sneak in not-particularly-subtle occult imagery . 
Who trolls the troll ? < PROPMALE > . He's feeling pretty MATRIMONIAL ! 
Write essay on World War 2 ... Forget to mention holocaust . Fail . 
Inexplicable loss of paper . Just what I needed . 
So . Remind me why I'm doing something stupid like graduating ? Unemployment and a return to dismal suburbia sound like exactly what I want to do right now . Yay , pointless boredom at the whim of pointless companies . 
Vaguely puzzled by the fact that when the sun woke me up at 7:00 I wasn't tired , but when my alarm clock went off at 9:00 , I was ... 
The less well known cousin of Bach's well tempered klavier is the infinitely less popular well ordered klavier , a piece which induced much somnolescence in listeners . 
Finishing 14 pages is like finishing the whole thesis , right ? 
Good news : Thesis draft one is done . Bad News : Thesis draft one is only 17 pages . 
Now legitimately done with a first draft of the Thesis ... Still too damn short . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > - this is bad . I can't stop watching . =/ 
On a scale from one to End of < PROPFEMALE > , Madoka gets a solid Serial Experiments Lain on the depressing endings scale . 
Was panning on cutting japanese . Should not have gone to lunch - met sensei there , now stuck inside on a perfectly nice afternoon ... 
Rumble does not have damage problems . If you think he does , you have what are colloquially referred to as \Baddie problems \"" 
Kinda thinks the banks should be required to pay for the student loans of students who have graduated in the last few years - after all , they made it harder for their parents to help them and made it harder for them to find jobs . 
\You Just Haven't Earned it Yet\ " takes on a distinctly darker note in current context . " 
Apparently the library has lots of material on < PROPFEMALE > Lovelace - this does actually surprise me slightly , but it is particularly odd because most of it is library use only , which I have never run into before . Weird . 
What a haul , what a haul ! Free books are best books ! =D 
Facebook has been completely exploited by these \test and keep\ " pages and stuff . Gross and annoying . " 
Got posted on Reddit ( thanks , < PROPMALE > ) . Apparently what I need is pictures . Unfortunately , I am legitimately image illiterate . 
Oh hey , look , someone hacked my WoW account from a few years ago . Fuck Blizzard's awful security ... 
Exposed < PROPFIRST > to the wonders of Alestorm . I expected him not to like them - but he's currently singing along with Huntmaster . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > Schwarzenberger < PROPMALE > Schmidtlein < PROPMALE > Pembroke Kahn < PROPMALE > Phend < PROPMALE > Wright Altheus starts a bit late today at 8 - I'm getting dinner with my parents . 
Done with notes for Lovelace paper . Just need to do the construction Monday and Tuesday . Thesis final rough draft done . Semester very nearly over for me . 
If I could draw , Altheus would be a web-comic . 
Blessed Beltane ! ( And , if you're in the rest of the world , happy Labor Day ! ) 
Osama is dead . Good riddance to bad rubbish . 
Has accidentally carried out a psychological experiment with a poem . At this point , I just want to start sending the poem to people and getting their response to check my hypotheses . 
Is done with his thesis . 
All my papers for the year are done . Yay .
