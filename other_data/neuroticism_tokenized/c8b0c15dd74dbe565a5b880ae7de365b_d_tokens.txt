in my seat at t.g.i fridays dancing to drop it like it's hot and watching the people that walk by look at me like I'm some retard . I am some retard ... :]

We all < PROPFEMALE > these things inside that no one else can see . They hold us down like anchors , they drown us out at sea . I look up to the sky , there may be nothing there to see but if I don't believe in him , why would he believe in me ? 
The Maine <3 
can't stand it . 
Goodbye my friends , goodbye my love you're in my heart . It was preordained that we should part . Were united by and by , united by and by , goodbye . No handshakes to endure , no there's nothing .

What a proud society we must be : Killing our most defenseless citizens in the name of a Womans right to choose . 
I hate today . Why is all of this happening ? 
I'm beginning to hate 90% of the people in this town . Maybe because I'm in a bad mood , I don't know . I'm done with everything . \ 
I'm ready to move back to Fl . 
The nearest H&M is 198.51 < PROPMALE > away . This suckksss . 
And I thought I was lucky to be traveling all around the country this summer , and then I find out my brother will be traveling around Europe at the same time . And once again , I have lost ... 
My 8 year old brother just told my friend that he was going to get her pregnant . Awesome , this is why I don't bring friends anywhere . 
Just do it\ 
Go to google ... \ 
Type In : tt0274518\ 
I've been laughing so hard I'm crying . 
Never let your brother and his friend borrow your phone :( 
Like a game of chess , I predict your every move\ 
I think I know you better , better than you do\ 
I'm sick of feeling cheap , cheated and abused\ 
I'm sick of losing sleep , thinking about you\ 
<3 The Downtown Fiction 
\Can you write a biology on someone who isn't real ? \ " I love you < PROPMALE > (: " 
Spanish class with < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , and Kelsea (: 
Tosh . 0 until I fall asleep (: < PROPMALE > tomorrow ! :D 
I feel so emotionally unprepared today and I don't know why yet ... :/ 
<3 that beautiful feeling you get when you hear a song for the second or third time and you know it's going to be your new favorite . 
I Am Number Four was either incredibly stupid or great as expected . Not sure which one . Anyweee , now I'm on the drive back from Cool Springs and I'm kinda thinkingg it's a Finding Nemo kind of night ...?! ;D 
I am hiding from some beast , but the beast was always here . Watching without eyes because the beast is just my fear : That I am just a nothing , and that's just what I've become . What am I waiting for ? It's already done . 
< PROPFEMALE > Black's parents had too much money to invest in her . 
Oh my Lordd , HAPPY BIRTHDAY < PROPMALE > NICHOLLS . 
s s s s , and m m (: 
Why do I have to be such a procrastinator ? I have to be up in 3 hours :/ 
Leaving The classes in Nashville ! Tomorrow is the last day and then I graduate :/ I'll miss all the girls SO much ! 
I can't wait to get back into my summer routine of staying up all night every night just to watch the beautiful sunrise in peace and then falling asleep a few minutes afterwards . I don't know why I love it so much , but it just puts me in a good mood . 
I've been jumping from the tops of buildings for the thrill of the fall , ignoring all sound advice , or any though of consequence . My bones are shattered , my pride is shattered . And in the midst of this self-inflicted pain , I can see my beautiful rescue . 
At < PROPFIRST>'s house , listening to the Backstreet Boys and looking at pictures of that gorgeous guy , Oli :D 
Ughh , people suckk ... 
Saying something and wishing you had not versus saying nothing and wishing you had . 
Lol . http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN23azps_d0&feature=youtube_gdata_player 
By far the best part of the movie :] http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RalDsFionzU&feature=youtube_gdata_player 
I'm aware that Nashville Fashion Week 2011 is going on from March 29-April 2 . I was researching the topic when I saw that CHRISTIAN SIRIANO is headlining . My eyes started to tear up . What made them tear up even more ? It was last night . 
Hopefully this will go over well ! I REALLY want to go this summer :/
