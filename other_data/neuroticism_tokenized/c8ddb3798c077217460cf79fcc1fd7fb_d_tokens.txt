managed to finish 2 presentations today and is now pretty much done for the year 
learned today that if you have a good enough defense you can be acquitted of anything , that 3rd graders today are much smarter than i was in 3rd grade , and that a large number of mammals have actual bones in their dicks- and people think you dont learn anything senior year 
I'm always wishing too late , for things to go my way , it always ends up the same .
