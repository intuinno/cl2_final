A real woman always keeps her house clean and organized , the laundry basket is always empty . She's always well dressed , hair done . She never swears and behaves gracefully in all situations and under all circumstances . She has more than enough < PROPFEMALE > to take care of her family , always has a smile on her lips , and a kind word for everyone . Post this in your status if you too suspect that you might be a man . 
Feeling like my brain was just scrambled . Too bad its only 12:30 ...

Love is patient , love is kind . It is not jealous , is not pompous , it is not inflated , it is not rude , it does not seek its own interests , it is not quick-tempered , it does not brood over injury ... It bears all things , believes all things , hopes all things , endures all things 1 Cor 13 : 4-7 
I'm doing the best I ever did . I'm doing the best that I can . Now GO AWAY !!!! 
Bad morning so far and its only 8am * sigh * 
For the record , I hate applications . But even more than applications , I hate having to ask people in a professional capacity about/for something that has no application . Ugh , so nerve wracking . Wish me luck people , today is the first sign of progress ( in a very long time ) for my quest ! Pray for me and keep your fingers crossed . * crosses eyes and toes *
