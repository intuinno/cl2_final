listening to classic rock ... on harp guitar 
To lose one's self in reverie , one must be either very happy , or very unhappy . Reverie is the child of extremes . 
Men are born ignorant , not stupid ; they are made stupid by education . 
It is little short of a miracle that modern methods of instruction have not already completely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry . I believe that one could even deprive a healthy beast of prey of its voraciousness if one could force it with a whip to eat continuously whether it were hungry or not 
finally i can my daily nap time back :) 
im just going to go ahead and assume there is no school tomorrow 
Topper is at the hospital :'(
