Wish I was still in D.C. ! 

School compared to NYLC is depressing ... 
Has anyone seen Dr. Strangelove ? If so please explain the ending to me . Lack of resolution is driving me crazy ... 
One of the most dissapointing experiences is to have somebody make you think they care about you dearly one day , then discard you the next . Thanks for showing me what your about . Im glad i didnt waste any more time than i did 
i get so sick of people saying thanks to me . I think that instead they should put themselves in a position where they have givin me a reason to thank them . 
Im officially deaf , but it was worth it ! Fuel and Random Hero rocked out .. 
Interesting night with < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > . Downtown was awesome and random 
When someone passes me and i nod my head , they better nod back . If i lose it someday and somebody doesnt nod back , somebody is going to get shot . Respect is a universal currency 
I was absent to my online class ? there's something wrong with that 
Pandora ! how did you know ?.. 
too much < PROPFEMALE > to my < PROPFEMALE > lately .. hurry up fall break .. 
Anyone know some places showing the ufc fight ?
