There is still no known cure for stupidity , but we can raise awareness . 93% won't copy and paste this , many because they're too stupid to know how to copy and paste . Will YOU make this your status for at least one hour !!

Please put this on \ 
your status if you know , or are related to , someone killed on the \ 
Death < PROPFEMALE > . My wish for 2010 is that people will understand that the\ 
Rebel Alliance is a band of murdering scum . 97% of the people on \ 
facebook are too heartless to spread this message . Are you one of \ 
the caring 3% ? 
If I cannot make a smartass comment on what people choose to like on facebook , then what is the sense in sharing the post ?? 
< PROPFEMALE > Benner\ 
likes Walmart \ 
and Grease . 
mafia wars friends ... could use some help in the fed boss fight ..... 
Happy First Birthday to my Little Guy . 
Doesn't make much sense does it ?? Our homeless go without eating . Elderly go without needed medicines . Mentally ill go without treatment . Troops go without proper equipment . Veterans go without benefits that were promised . Yet we donate billions to other countries before helping our own first . 1% will re-post and 99% won't . Have the guts to re-post this . I KNOW I'M in the 1% ( < PROPFEMALE > begins at home )
