Comment if you have been watching the Isner-Mahut match at Wimbledon . If you have not , it is epic and has broken nearly every record that can be broken in a single match . The fifth , final , and deciding set has yet to be completed and is currently at 59 games all , and has taken 7 hrs and counting , longer than the longest tennis match in history . This is completely insane . 
The Internet is back !!! We had no Internet or T.V for over two days ... and I think there's still a tree lying on the power lines down the road . 
I am trying to improve my choreography and so am thinking about choreographing one or two dances this summer while I have the time . Could you please maybe give me some suggestions on how to do this ?? Thanks !

Me : Why do we have a tree ornament that's Snoopy with a gun ? \ 
Mom : I don't really know , to be honest . \

BREAK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
is watching Joyeux < PROPFIRST > and realizing that while we spend days looking at statistics of how many people died and discussing how WWI caused people to lose their humanity we never once mentioned this event . Yes , Mr. Dankoff , there were uplifting moments in history too .

Apparently , being sick can be good for your health . :P 
Wondering what would happen if I went to summer camp or wherever and introduced myself to everyone by my middle name . \ 
Yes . This is what crosses my mind when I'm bored in class . 
So , CLEARLY today should have been a snow day , which means that we were robbed of a day off , which means that regardless of tomorrow's weather they OWE us a snow day ... All who agree , please like this status . 
Heat ! Light ! Internet ! ELECTRICITY !!!!!!!! Hooray !!!! \ 
And a good thing ... < PROPFEMALE > was shivering so much I thought I might have to bring her to bed under the duvet with me and we had to light so many candles it looked like we were planning to hold a seance . 
ANOTHER project ?? Do any of these teachers understand the concept of overwork ? 
Scrolling through the TV guide , looking for something to watch ... scrolling ... scrolling ... pass movie titled \Titanic II\ " ... scroll ... scroll ... wait . Scroll back scroll back . \ " Titanic TWO\ " ? But that doesn't make any SENSE ... "
