Thanks to everybody for all the happy birthdays . 

ready for school to start again so I can graduate already ... only 6 credits to go ! 
sunburns suck ! I have just begun the peeling stage and now look like a giant snake ! =( 
can't get ahold of my mom cuz when I call they just < PROPFEMALE > up on me 
they say it has to get worse before it can get better but I see it getting worse over and over again with no signs of improvement 
Usually I like it when summer goes by slow but this summer is so boring and I have things to finish at school . I just want ot graduate already and then be bored , but as a high school graduate . 
Just got back from camping in Oklahoma . It is so hot and sticky there ! 
I guess it's been decided . I am probably going to go to real school at DHS . I am kind of nervous . I am going to ask to go for 2 years that way it will be easy to make good grades and I won't be too busy . I will always still be an alternative student though lol . 
We picked up my little sister , < PROPFEMALE > from the airport yeserday . It's nice to see her after not seeing her in like 3 months and not living with her in 5 months . Saturday I get to see one of my bestfriends , < PROPFEMALE > . We will meet at Wonderland . I haven't seen her in like a year and a half . So excited ! 
so much time to waste . Gonna stay the night with < PROPFEMALE > . Excited ! 
Idk if I'm excited to go to Wonderland tomorrow . I would rather just stay in Dumas . 
Life has its way of twisting things in knots . 
Man , I just really don't know what to do anymore . I just wish everything would go back to normal . Maybe I should just have them ship me to Iowa for a while lol . 
Life goes on . That's the key to life is to know that is goes on . It is the only thing that will make life worth living . 
Bout to go do something with < PROPFEMALE > and Faith . 
Had lots of fun at < PROPFEMALE>'s lastnight and going to the lake later . I love summer . 
I am pretty happy right now . 
I have a giant bruise on my face ! < PROPFEMALE > like to bite too much . 
So tired . 
Finally made it to Iowa . I am already not looking forward to the ride home . 
My Aunt < PROPFEMALE > just had her baby ; Ely Bennet Winkler .
