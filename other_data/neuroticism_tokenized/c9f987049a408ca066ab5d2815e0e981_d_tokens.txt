trying to < PROPFEMALE > on to what i had while reaching for what i could have . if im not carefull i could loose it all ..... i hope my clutzy self doesnt trip .... 

i hate crazy bitches that cant except reality !! 
what would you do if the ground beneth your feet was disapearing ?? would you fight to stay up , or would you except that you were going to fall ?? 
Can you ever truly trust someone ? Even if if you try your hardest to not over think things ? Will I ever truly know ??? 
I want to trust him .... Its hard . Is he really telling me the truth ?? 
so how has everyone been sense graduation ??? answers below !!! 
When you think that you have controll of your life everything seems to shift beneath your feet , leaving you feeling like you will never be able to stand again ...... Ya , thats where I am . 
Im done .... Next !!!! 
I think im done .... NEXT !!! 
When you loose somthing , greiving comes with it normally . Why is it that I am not ? The world looks so much better and brighter !! I have my closure .... Sort of . 
Sometimes the world is a scary place to walk though alone .... But you have to tough it out and just do it . Soon you will relize that it's not as bad as you thought it would be . 
I'M COMING HOME IN AUGUST !!!! BE READY TO PARTY !!! 
OK ... THE DATE HAS CHANGED BUT IM STILL COMING OUT DAMN IT !!! AUG 20TH-SEPT 1ST !!! TWO WEEKS OF TREES !!! I CAN'T WAIT !!! 
Overly Excited !!!! Both my bosses are going to let me take two weeks off !!! So I will be out August 20th around Noon !!!!! YAY !!!! 
feeling good ..... Great Day !!! Cant Sleep !!!! What to do ... What to do ??? 
Found an awesome new rpg , WOWC style game ..... Age Of Conan !!! super realistic , and pretty fun !!!! Check it out !!!! 
Most people see me as heartless , I wish I was ... Then it would never shatter ........ 
If I could turn back time I would do it all over again ....... That is what scares me to death . 
Didnt loose my job ... but i am < PROPFEMALE > ing out with some friends that I dont get to < PROPFEMALE > with that often !!! yay !!! 
hanging with friends !!! yay !! 
Excited at the prospect of happiness .... 
Life is good for now ... 
Somethings are better left unsaid ; Although there are other things that should be shouted from the peak of Everest its self ..... 
Things always seem to get better and better , although it is just that ..... SEEMS . 
I love it when I get to talk to old friends !! 
What to do ... What to do ?? Im having a scruples issue .... I know somthing I shouldn't , I need to tell , But I dont want to loose a Friend . If I tell I will loose my friend , If I don't I may loose much more .... Any suggestions ?? 
I know whats good for me , yet I wish that what is not was ...... Why did things have to turn out the way that they did ? Why does anything turn out the way they do ? 
Have you ever had anything that you wanted so badly that you would fight off anything and anyone for ? I would .... 
Why are things complicated , Why dont people just do what they want to do ?? 
I got fired for the first time ! It kinda sucks , but at least I have another one ..... But what to do with all the extra time ?? 
So what has everyone been up to since high school ?? 
Is it possible to leave someone behind when they are still next to you ? 
Complication is a fact of life , but why does it have to be ?? Why is it that people have to pretend to be somthing that they are not , and act like they do not ????? I am sick of men ..

Im still mad ... but i dont think that i will get over that too quickly . After what he did to me it will\ 
be hard to trust again . 
Things are looking up . I feel alot better . This is all a experience that I will learn from and become that much more stronger . The anger will still be here for awhile though ....

im sooooo board ... any ideas what i can do to pass some time ?? 
A true friend doesn't care if you're broke , what you weigh , if your house is a mess , what you drive , about your past , or if your family is full of crazy people . Your conversations pick up where they left off , even if they were months apart . They love you for who you are . Re-post if you have at least ... one .. true friend . They will know who they are ;) Happy New Year !!

Looking back on the way things turned out I would not have changed a thing , but maybe there is a way to turn around . So that I may walk through the memory once again , and look at it through eyes with better perspective . 
I took a trip to yester-land ..... decided that i didnt like what i saw . things have to change soon .... i need a break 
It is said the the some of the best thing in life are the simplest . Why is it that those things that should be so simplistic turn out to be some of the most complicated ?
