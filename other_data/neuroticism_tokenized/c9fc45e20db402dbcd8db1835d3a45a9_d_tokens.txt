But self cherishing always brings pain . We create this massive ego in our life times . We educate it and feed it and give it sensual pleasure .

Who understands does not preach ; Who preaches does not understand . Reserve your judgments and words ; Smooth differences and forgive disagreements ; Dull your wit and simplify your purpose ; Accept the world . Then , Friendship and enmity , Profit and loss , Honour and disgrace , Will not affect you ; The world will accept you . 
Both praise and blame cause concern , For they bring people hope and fear . The object of hope and fear is the self For , without self , to whom may fortune and disaster occur ? Therefore , Who distinguishes himself from the world may be given the world , But who regards himself as the world may accept the world .
