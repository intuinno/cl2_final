BERKELEY IS AMAZING !!! 
totally psyched about wearing the beautiful yukata Hope Itoh let me borrow >_< 
I was lying on my bed , and happened to look at the ceiling . The ceiling was white , but somehow I could see a directional field . I somehow ended up trying to see what equation would make that directional field . Amazing what Mr. < PROPFIRST > Farley's AP Calculus can do ... 
had an amazing time at < PROPFEMALE > Provencher ' s house !!!! lots of heavenly chocolates and perverted jokes ; ) 
lost her Chemistry book ... 
\Just because you've got the emotional range of a teaspoon doesn't mean we all have . \ " -Hermione Granger . Happy Wizarding Independence Day !! "

At first , I cried because I fell and it hurt . The second time , I cried because I bled . The third time , I cried because I realized everyone was pretending not to notice me . I cried the fourth time , because I wanted them to stop ignoring me . The fifth time , I cried because I felt my heart break . After that , I stopped crying because of all the reasons I had cried .

doesn't like how korea's a maze of very VERY tall sky scrapers ... but she sure does like her 16.9 \ laptop =3 ... and the 7 nozzle shower system installed in her dad's new apartment . " 
finds that the world is too full of ironies ... like when an animal hospital is replaced by a butcher shop selling various species of animal meat . 
waking up after the anesthesia wears off from the eye surgery is basically like going up to the devil and asking for a generous serving of hell on fire with extra brimstones on the side . 
likes shoes . Korea has lots of shoes . Therefore , she likes korea . * goes on a shoe shopping spree * WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE 
I mean , I don't mean to brag ... but WOOHOOO ! ALL 5's IN ALL OF MY 5 AP TESTS !!!!!! Ya take that , collegeboard ! 
Korea , possibly the only nation that actually delivers McDonald's , and has yellow watermelon ( genetic cross between a pineapple and a watermelon ) . It's a weird place , but hey , who doesn't like a Big < PROPMALE > delivered right in front of your doorsteps ? 
saw a friend of hers from 5th grade . Needless to say , she is the better driver . 
is missing her brother , < PROPFIRST > Choi , terribly . Who else can she bother on a slow day such as this ? Oh ... right . < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > Tauqir , < PROPFEMALE > Pratt , < PROPFEMALE > Provencher and/or < PROPFEMALE > Kerr would do just as well . Anyone up for a game of FB word relay game ? 
Who do you think you are , running around leaving scars ? Collecting your jar of hearts , and tearing love apart . You're gonna catch a cold , from the ice inside your soul . So don't come back for me ... don't come back at all .

Best place to work out your glutts : Great wall of < PROPFEMALE > . \ 
Best place to pretend that you're a little black kid learning how to do karate from a shady looking Chinese Kung-Fu master : Great wall of < PROPFEMALE > . \ 
Best place for Chinese Food : Panda Express . 
met a friend from 3rd grade >_< . She now firmly believes I am a good driver . =P 
\Experiment in a bar ? Like in a bar bar ? \ " Of course that's what a bar is ... Hating this alcohol education thing right now . " 
went clam digging ... which means i basically shoveled a lot of sand and put salt over any holes created that's roughly elliptical ... yuppp . XD 
no , Korean Japanese ramen shop lady . It is possible to have ramen as a take-out . You only need to put the frigging ramen in a plastic bowl and put a lid on it , throw a pair of chopsticks in along with some napkins into a plastic bag . It really isn't rocket science , but since you obviously don't have any proper education in being polite to the customers , I doubt you'd know how . Btw , your shop sucks . * rawr * 
Be who you are and say what you feel , because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind . 
is getting hospitalized ... yet she feels excited cuz she feels like she's on an episode of House . 
fml . the hospital food sucks . =/ but my kidney tissues will be used for the sake of scientific research . ( the only good part ) . 
found my berkeley roomies =D

less than a week before i get to meet my adopted family !!! As in < PROPFEMALE > Pratt , Boomer Pratt , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > , and Boomer Pratt !! ( and other people but you guys aren't so close to me in the family tree so lol ) =D . And IN-N-OUT , here I come !!!! 
is going to go poodlize her hair =3 
mwrrrrr slow day ... so tired ... * curls up on the bed and naps * 
went to the hospital and learned that she is 158.8 cm . Rounded up , that's 159cm =D . Also in inches it also means that I'm officially 5'2 . 5\ >___< It's a good day for me hahahahahaha " 
last day i'll spend in my dad's apartment .... seriously sad that i'm leaving him ..... 
likes her first Berkeley class of the year : Math 1A . I'm so glad I remember most of the things Mr. < PROPFIRST > Farley taught last year in AP Calc , or else I'd be lost . lol 
Second day in Berkeley : I have decided I'm not smart/hard-working enough to deserve to be here . Seems like I should seriously hit the books 24/7 from now on . * puts her nerd glasses on and cracks her left hand to start writing some serious notes . 
College : where the leaders of tomorrow wake up at 12 everyday . 
loves her chemistry class . >_< 
V8 pong : the healthier and the nastier variation of beer pong . I prefer the original ... V8 is just NASTY !!!

excited to learn what Innovative Design can teach me about Photoshop =D 
Samsung fascinate . the best phone I have ever seen ... Now it's mine !!!! * evil laugh 
Loves how she slept about 4 hours and missed the chem review .... She'll do so well on her first midterm in berkeley * sarcasm * . What's sadder is that she still won't get out of the bed and is updating her status on facebook . Lol 
xoxo , GOSSIP GIRLS <3<3 
First chem was like a bullet to the head . But just not as fun . 
< PROPFEMALE > is cooler than < PROPFIRST > <3 
Mwrrrrr can't wait to take some more naps ! 
Think twice before you speak , and then you may be able to say something more insulting than if you spoke right out at once . 
likes Bollywood dancing !!!! and also belly dancing and cardio hip hop and Zumba .... Now if only Berkeley has a class on pole dancing .... XD ( No , I'm not being sarcastic people . pole dancing is a great workout for your upper body ) 
<3 ' s < PROPFIRST > H . < PROPFIRST > for getting me boba to help me feel better . It's delicious btw . 
Berkeley : the only you will see a hobo using his laptop while bring for spare change , and a very strong , full grown man crying because of his grade . 
Saw a girl with a tattoo of the symbol pi on the nape of her neck . I think it is extremely fashionable . 
A bitch just said that there should be left handed desks because being left handed is a disability . When I was like \what did you say ? \ " She chickened out and said that she was \ " just kidding\ " . I hope she gets hit by a lightning . \ " just kidding . \""
