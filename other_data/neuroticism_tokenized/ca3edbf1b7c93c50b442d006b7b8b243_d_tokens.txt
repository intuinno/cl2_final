HAPPY NEW YEAR ! 
This is my new profile for friends only . Very few family members will be added cause I'm sick of em controlling me . 
Like this status and I'll rate you 1-10 (: 
I'd give you my heart , and let you just hold it < \\3 
Changed my mind . I'm stayin on facebook ... But on my other account (:< 
Ok ... Now I'm really getting off facebook . Mornin people . Happy 15th < PROPMALE > ... 
In approximately 20 minutes ( 11:11 ) Imma make a wish . You should too ... Who knows , maybe we'll get lucky ... Can't lose hope . 
Lions and Tigers and Bears , Oh My (: 
Your voice was the soundtrack of my summer , do you know you're unlike any other ? 
Found some needles . Acupuncture , anyone ? ( : 
Ich liebe dich </3 
They're taking the hobbits to Isengard ! :O 
Watching Final Fantasy VII Advent Children an rediscovering my love for Cloud Strife (: 
Dilly-dally shilly-shally ! ( : 
\I pity you ... You just don't get it at all . There's not a thing I don't cherish ! \ " * proceeds to kick sephiroth's arse*- Cloud Strife (: " 
Mi mami is my bestfriend . And I will always forgive and love her cause in the end , the few moments where we get along and all outweigh all the bad ones . 
Well , gettin off ... For now . 
Makes me feel pretty pathetic to realize I'm more cruel to the people I love then to the ones I hate . 
You swore you'd never hit em , never do nothin to hurt em , now you're in eachothers ' face spewin venom in your words when you spit em . You push , pull eachothers ' hair , scratch , claw , bit em , throw em down , hit em , so lost in the moments when you're in em ... 
\the best birthday present I ever got was 10 minutes after I was born . \"- < PROPMALE > Kaulitz " 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , I miss you ! D : 
Imma be who I set out to be , without a doubt undoubtedly , and all those who look down on me , I'm tearin ' down your balcony . 
Roses are red , violets are blue , I have five fingers ; the middle one's for you [: 
Want to see a real friend ? Look at my wall , the post under mine (: 
Wow . I missed a lot while my internet was down ... 
Bestfriends ; anyone remember what MY song is ? Hint 1 ) it was written on my closet mirror for a longgg time . Hint 2 ) The band's initials are CB (: 
You know what ? I wish I could go back to 5th grade . And the beginning of 6th . Why ? I miss my bestfriends of the time . 
\Going to school it felt like you were in a meat grinder . It chews you up and pours out this mess that can't function . \ " - < PROPMALE > Way talking about highschool " 
finds it funny how hypocritical people can be . 
You know who's amazing ? Christofer < PROPFIRST > Ingle of NeverShoutNever (: Just putting that out there (: 
( kill the lights)\ 
These children learn from\ 
Cigarette burns , \ 
Fast cars , \ 
Fast women , \ 
And cheap drinks . \ 
( it feels right)\ 
All these asphyxiated , \ 
Self-medicated , \ 
Take the white pill , \ 
You'll feel alright . \ 
-I'm Not Your Boyfriend Baby- 3Oh ! 3 
See I've been looking up looking down looking side to side\ 
Wonderin why this world is the way it is and why my mama cries\ 
Every night I'm trying to rest my head on the floor , \ 
half stoned thinkin damn this shit gets old\ 
\ 
-Damn This Shit Getz Old- NeverShoutNever/Christofer < PROPFIRST > 
< PROPFEMALE > Ring is amazing , gorgeous , beautiful , etc (: Love you shortcake , keep your head up ! 
And that was the day that I swore I'd never sing of love if it does not exist . 
Suddenly in a reallyyyyy good mood all of a sudden . Dunno why . Haha , BABY I LIKE IT ! :D 
I'm so happy cause today's my favourite/lucky dayyy (: And I'm not saying that cause it's Friday thirteenth . The magic 8 ball said it is ! 
My bestfriend really needs to stop teaching my baby cousin bad words (: 
\All we ever did was move around . \ 
is lost . Needs to be found . Preferably by someone who won't hurt her/break her heart . 
Please just don't play with me , my paper heart will bleed ... 
is being forced to go to bed . ' Night . 
wants a hippopotamus for Christmas !!!!! 
It's my little sister Brooklyn's birthday today ! She's eight (: 
has changed her mind . She doesn't want a hippo , she wants a marmoset (: 
refuses to stoop to her level (: Not even gonna reply (: 
wants to know what colour she should get if she gets streaks in her hair ( ex ; green ? Purple ? ) . 
Ok , so ... In about ... 8 (?) months , I'm moving to Missouri . This would normally upset me , except I'm gonna live near Joplin . Why does this make me happy ? Cause Christofer < PROPFIRST > lived/lives (?) there !!! :D 
And somehow he always manages to come out as the heartbroken heartbreaker , always turning the tables . You can never be the bad guy , can you ? Keep wallowing in your self-pity . Drown in it . How do I take this ? 
Sometimes there's gonna be a person that hurts you more then it's worth taking . No matter how much you care about them , you have to learn to do what's best for both of you . Just walk away . Whether or not they see what they've done and < PROPMALE > you is their problem . Learn and let go . 
They say quitters never win\ 
But we walk the plank on a sinking ship , There's a world outside of my front door that Gets off on being down ... \

I'm really just asking to leave ... 
And she does her best to fix others'\ 
Problems because she has no idea how\ 
To fix her own ... 
Is now on a computer so her iPod can't change words and get her in trouble with her friends .

Dear < PROPMALE > Kaulitz ; \ 
Sydnee RedDog < PROPMALE > is your biggest fan and she'll follow you until you love her , papa , paparazzi . \

Yup , I censored it . \ 
Cause I'm awesome . 
MMM COFFEE . \ 
' bouta go be stupid and jump on my trampoline barefoot in the middle of the night . \ 
WHOOT . 
Ended up hitting my leg really , really hard on the metal frame of the trampoline and breaking skin . \ 
It's all bruised and ugly and it's right on the bone . \ 
It didn't really hurt cause the cold numbed it , until I came inside . \ 
First words outta my mouth ? \ 
Can't tell you . They were kinda rude c : 
\ < PROPFEMALE > tales do not tell children dragons exist . Children already know the dragons exist . < PROPFEMALE > tales tell children the dragons can be killed . \"- G.K. Chesterton " 
Awww , you don't like me ? D: \ 
Here , have a tissue . c ; 
< PROPFIRST > Lennon is my hero . \ 
He was and will always be loved . <3 
No real man hits a lady . Or a person of the female variety ... ( LOL)\ 
But seriously . ' Tis bad . Don't do it . < PROPFEMALE > ? 
Oh , oh , oh\ 
How was I supposed to know\ 
That you were oh , oh , over me ? \ 
I think that I should go ( Go ! )\ 
And something's telling me to leave\ 
But I won't\ 
Cause I'm damned if I do ya , \ 
Damned if I don't . 
< PROPFEMALE > is the coolest name ever ^^ 
I only keep myself this sick in the head \ 
Cause I know how the words get you ( off ! ) ... \ 
We're the new face of failure , \ 
Prettier and younger but not any better off ... \ 
Bulletproof loneliness , at best , at best . 
is off to bang her head against a wall . Later peoples . 
I'm not a crybaby , I'm THE crybaby . (- < PROPMALE > Wentz ) 
Superman sucks . The end . 
Killjoys never die . 
Me and < PROPMALE > Speth are besties ! ^^ 
Killjoys never die . \

Then re-programmed . \

Hanging with Mareena Pafford <3 \

You know you're a killjoy when : You're ( almost ) successful in burning down the house of S/c/a/r/e/c/r/o/w . Even if said S/c/a/r/e/c/r/o/w is your mom . \

DRUGS , GIMME DRUGS , GIMME DRUGS\ 
I don't need em but I'll sell what you got\ 
Take the cash , and I'll keep it\ 
Eight legs to the wall , hit the gas , kill em all ! \ 
And we crawl , and we crawl , and we crawl !

I don't need it but I'll take what I want \ 
from your heart and keep it in a bag , \

Gimme more , gimme more , gimme more !

Kiss me you animal ! 
Tu salvati , io < PROPFEMALE > tratterrò . 
Who's beasty ? THE PACKERS ! 
There's really no such thing as fixing something that's broken . You can tape it up , super-glue it , white it out , mend it . But it's\ 
not permanent , just a temporary solution . In the end , it'll never be the same as it was before , and maybe other people won't\ 
be able to tell the difference , but you can . It'll eat at you , pick you apart . \ 
Once you f&ck it up , it's f&cked up FOREVER . 
\Woooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh 
Uhm , yea . \ 
Half of my hair is purple . \ 
... xDDD\ 
Don't be surprised tomorrowwww . 
Just found out < PROPMALE > Wentz and Asslee Simpson are getting divorced . \ 
Feel terrible for < PROPMALE > , because apparently , he asked her not to file the papers , and for Bronx , because divorced parents just sucks . But uhm , yea , I always knew < PROPFEMALE > was gonna pull this BS . So . Much luck and love to < PROPMALE > . \ 
( And yes , I realize a majority of you don't care . But I do . So , ha . ) 
If the world was ending because of , let's say , a nuclear war , and you had no < PROPMALE > of survival , what would you do ? \ 
As for me , well , I'd grab that person I know I need more then anyone , even if I didn't want to need them , and I'd never let go . I'd even float around as a little vaporized particle with my ... Particle-arms around them . 
< PROPFIRST > Jett = new hero . Forever and ever . 
It's pretty bogus when you're too nervous to talk to people you used to call your bestfriends . 
Happiness begins where < PROPFEMALE > ends . 
Should I worry if I can't stop trembling and I have no idea why ? 
Oh , Mondays I sleep away\ 
Tuesdays I lay awake\ 
Wednesdays are the worst\ 
Whoa , Thursdays I reminisce\ 
Friday , I see your face and I can't breathe\ 
Although the distance is daring , I sure know what it's like to be alone . 
Oh god , the stupid . It BURNS . 
On the first < PROPFEMALE > of our story , \ 
The future seemed so bright . \ 
Then this thing turned out so evil , \ 
I don't know why I'm still surprised ... \ 
Even angels have their wicked schemes\ 
And you take that to new extremes ;\ 
But you'll always be my hero , \ 
Even though you've lost your mind . 
I love < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Rusler . \

Give me a reason to end this discussion , \ 
to break with tradition , to fall and divide . \ 
Cos I hate the ocean , theme parks and airplanes , \ 
Talking with strangers , waiting in line . \ 
I'm through with the pills that make me so still , \ 
\Are you feeling fine ? \ " \ 
Can we fake it , can we make believe ? \ 
I'm so full of love , it deeply sickens me . \ 
But all I could do was close my eyes , \ 
And cross my arms , and hope to die , \ 
Cos you don't f*cking listen , when I'm around ... 
Having a deep conversation about self w < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Branham . 
I guess I can live without you , but\ 
Without you I'll be miserable at best .
