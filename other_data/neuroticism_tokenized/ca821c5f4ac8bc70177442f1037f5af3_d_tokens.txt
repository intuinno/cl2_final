had way too much fun last night . My brain hurts =/ 

just gave the little monster a bath , now time to watch a movie with hubby :) 
is starting school tomorrow ! I'm excited but I don't want to leave Lexi ... maybe I can sneak her in with me ;) 
I can't sleep ... again . 
has way too much homework to do !!! 
has the most beautiful baby . Ever :) 
The screen on my phone is broken so if I don't text you back it's because I can't see ! 
So ... I think hubby and I just survived our biggest marital test . 1 . I let him buy a 50\ flat screen and didn't kill him in the store while he begged and carried on like a child in the cereal aisle . 2 . I helped him put the entertainment center together and he didn't kill me while I told him he was doing it all wrong ( which he totally was ) . Teamwork :) " 
About to cuddle up with hubby and watch The Office . Our one year anniversary is tomorrow , I'm so excited !!! 
Lexi is sleeping in her crib tonight ! I have my bed back ! I wonder how long this will last ... 
is loving her hubby and baby girl :) 
Kanye is such an ASS . 
has a whiny little baby at home ... and I am not talking about Lexi . Hubby is sick :( 
LOVES her baby girl :) 
My brain hurts ... 
Can someone please explain to me how knowing the pros and cons of being left-handed is going to dramatically change my outlook on life ? This is what my psychology homework is telling me ... 
is procrastinating ... 
really can't stand it when the people who live across the street have a random car in the yard with the base going really freaking loud for over two hours . They stopped before I had the < PROPMALE > to be a party pooper and make a noise complaint , but my head hurts and I swear I can still hear it ! Ughhh .... 
Brushing a one-year old's teeth is about as fun as brushing a crocodile's teeth . I think that was the first time she bit me , lol . 
needs a life ... 
Can't wait for Lexi's birthday party tomorrow ! I bought her way too many toys today , lol :) I can't believe she is going to be a year old already ... 
OMG ! Did anyone see < PROPMALE > ?! 
is just angry and frustrated . 
THE FACEBOOK TRICK : press up , up , down , down , left , right , left , right , B , A , Enter key , then right click then press up and down and magic crcles will appear . the only way to get rid of them are to log off or refresh the page ... IT TOTALLY WORKS . Post this as your status if it does ! 
Lexi has spots =/ 
hates being sick and is still heartbroken over what happened on < PROPMALE > :( 
My head hurts :( 
is hoping it will rain/snow/freeze so hubby can get off work early . I want to cuddle and watch a movie :) 
has the most wonderful and adorable baby girl ever :) 
Yay ! Hubby's getting off work early . Cuddle time :) 
Daybreakers was LAME .

Wow Lexi and I slept until noon today ! 
So my 21st birthday is tomorrow and I lost my ID ! Boo :( 
Thanks for the birthday wishes everyone :) 
* WANTED * Someone to come play in the snow with me :) 
I am completely over this snow . I want it all to melt right now ! 
I love my Lexi :) 
I don't even KNOW . 
just bought a TON of stuff for the apartment ! 
Call me a party pooper but seriously I hope it does not snow this week ! Last week was enough ! 
My little monster already loves to read ! She's been bringing me books nonstop for days and right now she is sitting on the couch \reading\ " to herself . I'm so proud of her ! " 
has TONS of stuff to do and little time to do it =/ 
Why is it that when you move , you seem to have way more junk than you originally thought ??? Blah . 
hates being sick :( 
If God's the game that you're playing , well we must get more aquainted . Because it has to be so lonely , to be the only one who's holy ... next time you point a finger , I'll point you to the mirror . 
is thinking of getting some blonde in my hair ... what do you think ? 
going to get Lexi's Easter stuff :) 
ohmygosh there are soap suds coming out of the dishwasher !!! 
is finishing up dinner so hubby and I can have a movie night <3 
watching a movie with my < PROPFEMALE > <3 
Let's see who is paying attention ... Every single one of you are on my friend list as a result of a conscious decision . I am not only glad to count you as a friend but also as family ! Let's see who is on my friends list actually pays attention . Copy and post this on your status . I will be watching to SEE !!! 
Sooo my printer keeps randomly spitting out pages with weird designs on them ... should I be worried ? Is my printer trying to tell me something ? Where is Miss < PROPFIRST > when you need her .... 
Grey's better not be a rerun or I am boycotting television . But just for tonight :D 
So I am cooking chicken in the oven and one of the legs is bleeding profusely ... is this normal ? My oven looks like a slasher film .... 
is completely and utterly exhausted . 
just got the < PROPFEMALE > in bed , now time to settle down with my wonderful hubby <3 
had way too much fun this weekend ! Must do again :) 
working on baby pics :) 
If you have a husband that makes you LAUGH , that you can say is your best friend , who you want to grow old with , who you know will always be there to pick you up when you are feeling down , who is your world , and a man that you can thank God every night for , copy & paste this to your profile with your anniversary date .... August 30th ? 
Lexi can climb up the stairs ! Lord help me ... 
is wide awake ! ... & thinking about Starbucks :] 
Woohoo ! I've been up all night ! Now I'm wired ! Yay ! :D 
cookie crisps . nom nom nom :D 
yeah ... in complete zombie mode today . Sleep sounds soooo nice ... gotta tough it out ! 
ugh ... 
Ready for the weekend <3 
< PROPMALE > Lightfoot sang a song about a boat that sank in the lake at the break of the morn and a cat named Stevens found a faith he could believe in and < PROPFIRST > Baez never listened to too much jazz ... but hippie songs could be heard in our pad ? 
I love you so much , it hurts ! I loved you \ 
when you were born , I saw your face and I knew that I was in love . \ 
Before you were an hour old , I knew I would die for you . To this day , \ 
I will . This is the miracle of life . Put this on your status if you \ 
have children you love more than life . 
hubby is sick ... that makes me sad :( 
Violence is stupid . It doesn't make you real , it just makes you a small person with an even smaller mind . Sheesh . 
I used to think anyone doing anything weird was weird . Now I know that it is the people that call others weird that are weird . 
jammin on 90's music :D 
movie night with the hubbs :) 
is loving the gloom and doom o.O 
running on fumes today ... 
What do you think is the most powerful force in the universe ? 
is cleaning , cleaning , cleaning ... and being awesome :p 
I want my hubby back . I think his work has kidnapped him :( 
had way too much fun last night , now time to relax and enjoy a quiet week :) 
Lexi had so much fun swimming at < PROPFEMALE>'s! She LOVES the water ! 
is starting work on Tuesday ... this should be interesting ;P 
Wow , could my Lexi get any cuter ? She is cracking me up today ! I love her so much :) 
Yay ! Beach next weekend after all :) 
Zombieland !!! 
Hide your feathers on the back porch baby , you've been such a liar ... 
Long day ... time to relax with the hubby :D 
can't find my stupid phone ! :( 
< PROPFIRST > taught Lexi to say \I'm < PROPMALE > Burgundy . \ " LOL " 
How do you know so much ? If you really knew what you claim to know , you would have the understanding that faith and knowledge are two opposite ends of the spectrum . You don't * know * anything . That doesn't mean you can't have faith . Don't be so easily threatened . 
Had a wonderful day shopping !!! Bought new clothes and the most adorable goodies from FloAnn's ... time to see what's up for tonight :) 
BORED . 
El Fenix coming to Waxahachie HECK YES :) 
Happy birthday to my wonderful , handsome , sweet , smart , funny , AMAZING hubby ! I love you < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > <3 
SLEEP :) 
Can't sleep , way too much on my mind ... 
Looks like miss Lexi is going to be a big sister :) 
So I found out my due date ! April 4th 2011 :) It seems so far away , lol . 
Too much running around to do , too early in the morning =/ 
I seriously have the BEST daughter in the world . She's the most precious thing in my life , and if her little brother/sister is anything like her I will be one blessed mommy ! 
I need a maid =/ 
was just assaulted by an abnormally large cricket . Lord help me . 
If anyone knows a good middle name to go with < PROPFEMALE > , let me know :) I'm out of ideas , lol ! 
Going to < PROPFIRST>'s parents ' house for fajitas , then taking Lexi to spend the night with her Nanny so I can get some much needed rest and get this morning/all dern day sickness under control ! Little bean is proving to be a handful already ! 
Right now , I need a \dislike\ " button . " 
is sick of being sick ! I have a feeling this is going to be a LONG pregnancy . On the bright side El Fenix with the parents tonight :) 
Went grocery shopping with hubby and Lexi :) We were getting in the car and she pointed to my seat and and said \Mommy ! Sit down NOW ! \ " lol " 
Saw the doctor today , had an ultrasound and a pic of little peanut ! New due date , April 12 :) 
I have the best husband in the world ! After working a 17 hour day , he still came home and played with Lexi and tucked her into bed . He's such an amazing dad ! <3 him :) 
feeling miserable tonight :( 
Subway ! :) 
I can't believe < PROPFIRST > and I have been married for 2 years today ! Time has flown by ... Ilu babe <3 
Ugh , seriously they should just call it all day/night sickness . :( 
Seriously , I've been up sick since 5am GIVE ME A BREAK :( 
Going to the doctor AGAIN :( 
Gosh , I have the best kid in the world ! There is nothing better than when she sprints towards me with a big \I love you mommy ! \ " and a kiss . I am truly blessed :) " 
:( 
Before I do anything I ask myself “Would an idiot do that ? ” And if the answer is yes , I do not do that thing . -Wise words from < PROPMALE > Schrute 
I have discovered that any computer malfunction can be solved with 10-20 restarts , abuse of the keyboard , and a few expletives . Problem solved :) 
Almost all of us long for peace and freedom ; but very few of us have much enthusiasm for the thoughts , feelings , and actions that make for peace and freedom . ~ Aldous Huxley 
Waiting for hubby to get back from Wichita Falls , I miss him ! Doctor's appointment tomorrow , time to see how little peanut is coming along :) 
just saw a clip of \the situation\ " rehearsing for DWTS . He should stick to fist-pumping . " 
Twittering : WLJ2316 
Only four more days until < PROPMALE > !!! :D 
So me and Lexi JUST woke up , I love it when we sleep in :) She's in a wonderful mood , and I feel great ! :D 
We start potty-training today ! I'm not worried about it , mommy's < PROPFEMALE > is so smart she'll pick it up in no time :) 
Day one of potty-training : Success ! My < PROPFEMALE > did so good , I'm thinking this will be easier than I thought :) 
Does anyone know where I can find boxes , like for moving ? I need alot ... 
Seriously not putting up with it tonight . But ready for tomorrow , hopefully good news ! Off to bed :) 
is LOVING this cold weather !!! So happy to not be preggers in the summer again :D 
Off to bed :) 
It's pretty sad when someone truly has NO IDEA how completely pathetic they are . Seriously . 
is craving fried butter . Is it possible to crave something you've never had before ? At least I have an excuse this time ! ;) 
Ugh , I've been getting headaches every night for weeks ! I don't know if it's the pregnancy or just stress ... I'm sick of it :( 
I was considering some GTL for tomorrow ... but then I realized I can't do the G or the T for awhile , and I'm sick of doing the L ! No bueno =/ 
Too much to do , so little time ! STRESSED =/ 
So I made chocolate chip cookies , I have my cinnamon pumpkin spice Scentsy going , and my house smells AMAZING right now . Just like Thanksgiving :D This is by far my favorite time of year ! 
what the hell 
Feeling butterflies :D 
ATTENTION !!! Do NOT join the group currently on Facebook with the title \Becoming a Father or Mother was the greatest gift of my life\ " . It is a group of pedophiles trying to access your photos . This was on Fox News at 5 . Please copy and post !!! Let's keep our children safe ! " 
Watching Beauty and the Beast with my < PROPFEMALE > :) 
Please pray for my baby girl . We've been at the doctor since 2:30 pm and now we're at the hospital trying to find out what's making her sick . They're doing a lot of tests and she's just exhausted :( 
Ultrasound November 18th ! Can't wait to find out if we're having another < PROPFEMALE > or a little < PROPMALE > :) 
So glad my < PROPFEMALE > is feeling better :) 
I can't believe I'm already planning Lexi's 2nd birthday party ! My baby girl is growing up so fast . Any ideas ? 
Babies \R\ " Us online ... the joys of pregnancy :D " 
< PROPMALE > is taking over my life . 
OMG so I just had a minor heart attack ! I went to check on Lexi and she wasn't in her bed , so I started panicking and then I realized she had climbed into mommy's bed ! She had Bonk , < PROPFEMALE > , and her Hush Little Baby book and her sippy cup . Scared me half to death , but also pretty adorable . I'm not even moving her , we'll just have a slumber party :) 
It's always ridiculous when people who have acted like complete assholes their entire life get the bright idea to \change\ " and become some sort of moral compass for others . Hard to take them seriously when they have absolutely * no * credibility ... " 
Put this on your status if you know/love someone who is gay . My wish for 2010 is that people will understand that being gay is not a disease nor a choice-people who are gay are not looking for a cure , but ACCEPTANCE and EQUAL RIGHTS . 
Baby is really kicking this week ! I can't wait until the 18th to find out whether we'll be buying pink or blue this time . I have a feeling it's blue but as long as baby is healthy I am happy :) 
To my friends who have kids or are pregnant : DON'T buy the baby monitors that have video , I saw on the news that criminals can put them in their car to pick up your frequency and see inside your home , right in the baby's room ! Scary ... 
Pumpkin carving , fire , s'mores ... gonna be a great night ! 
is soooo not cut out for the nightlife . Getting some very much needed sleep :) 
had so much fun trick-or-treating with my little pirate , she was perfect and got lots of < PROPFEMALE > ! I <3 you < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > :) 
really wishes humans weren't so damned ignorant . 
REALLY wants to see 127 Hours ! 
Only two more weeks until we find out pink or blue ! :) 
ready for hubby to get home ! Whole Foods , Cheesecake Factory , and shopping for Lexi's birthday presents ... sounds like a good date to me :) 
18 weeks today !!! :) 
I can't believe my baby girl is going to be two years old on Friday ! Where has the time gone ? I love that little monster so much :) I'm so ready for her party , she is going to LOVE it ! 
Doogie Howser at 2:30 AM ? Definately . 
One more week ! One more week ! :) 
Happy birthday to my wonderful little < PROPFEMALE > ! I love you Lexi :) 
I'm sitting here watching < PROPFIRST > and Lexi have a tea party , pretty sure it's the cutest thing ever :) 
Thursday cannot come fast enough ! 
So excited for my ultrasound at 2:00 !!! 
IT'S A BOY !!! :) 
can't wait to go shopping for BLUE baby stuff tomorrow ! :) 
Date night with the hubby ! Putt-putt and < PROPMALE > Potter @ the drive-in :) 
< PROPMALE > :) 
Boy names are much harder to pick than girl names . I'm drawing a blank here ! =/ 
The only thing I hate about shopping online is waiting for my stuff to get here =/ But I bought some wonderful goodies for baby boy :) 
Me : \Lexi 
There is nothing cuter than watching my < PROPFEMALE > have a long , serious conversation with the cat . I think they really understand each other ;) 
just made the pumpkin pies for tomorrow ! So excited :) 
needs to pick a name for baby boy ! Ideas ? :) 
watching The Grinch with my < PROPFEMALE > :) 
Wonderpets !!! :P 
Well , we have a name for baby boy ! His name is < PROPMALE > :) Now we just need a middle name .... 
is NOT having a good day :( 
Happy Christmas < PROPFEMALE > !!! :) 
Uncle Matt : \Lexi 
is watching Tinkerbell with my beautiful , wonderful , sweet , smart , funny , and AMAZING little girl ! < PROPMALE > is a lucky boy to have such an awesome sister :) 
< PROPMALE > sure is being kicky tonight !

If guns kill people , then pencils misspell words , cars drive drunk , and spoons made Oprah fat ! Remember : Hold the person accountable for their actions , not the means they chose to utilize !!! Repost if you agree- I did ! 
I just switched OB's at 28 weeks . Not ideal , but thank God I won't be delivering in Ennis after all ! 
Appointment with Dr. Brown went wonderful , loved him ! Pre-registered at the hospital in Mansfield , BIG sigh of relief :) 
Lexi just told me to stop \bogarting\ " the TV . Apparenting watching the news in a house run by a two year old is a sin . lol . " 
Up all night , can't sleep =/ Might as well go buy groceries ... 
I'm beginning to think this nonstop Superbowl coverage is a well choreographed media distraction . I don't trust it . 
Enjoying another lazy snow day with the hubby abd baby girl :) Too bad he'll probably have to work the weekend =/ 
They tell me it's colder than a witch's tit outside but I wouldn't know , I'm burning up ! The joys of pregnancy ... 
This potty training business is for the birds =/ 
I think I'm more excited about Lexi's first sleepover tonight than she is . She's so cute with her little friend < PROPFEMALE > ! 
has woken up to two very rambunctious little girls ! Lord help me . 
My loyalties for tonight's game shall be determined by none other than eeny meeny miny moe . Just saying ... 
Thank you everyone for the birthday wishes ! Very much appreciated :) 
Sick :( 
Babies ' R Us , get ready . You won't know what hit you ;) 
We think hubby has the flu . Praying Lexi and I don't catch it =/ 
Me and Lexi caught < PROPFIRST>'s flu :( 
Having the flu at 32 weeks pregnant is NOT fun :( 
Happy Valentines 
Hey ! I need addresses to pass on to my sister for the baby shower for < PROPMALE > . If you are on my friends list and are seeing this message , you are invited . Please and thank you and I'd love to see everyone there <3 
Watched Catfish last night . People are crazzzzzy ... 
Seriously , who has morning sickness their ENTIRE pregnancy ? Just my luck . The pharmacy is taking forever to refill my meds so it looks like I'll be laid up the rest of the day =/ 
I can think of about 15875369648751250 things I would rather do than buy groceries right about now . Oh , well ... Wingstop will make it worth the trip =) 
I need a maid . 
No matter what anyone tells you , DO NOT watch The Human Centipede . WORST MOVIE EVER . The most disturbing thing I've ever seen . * shudder * 
< PROPFIRST>'s wedding today !!! :) 
Can't wait to see Dr. Brown tomorrow so he can make me better ! I'm sick of being sick :( 
Nothing like starting the morning off with hospital food ... ugh =/ 
Going home today YAY !!! 
Baby girl has pneumonia :( What a day . 
I hate seeing Lexi so sick . She doesn't even want to get out of bed to eat or anything , and she keeps waking up crying . Please pray she gets better soon , I miss my little wild child ! 
My poor baby has to have another shot today for her pneumonia . Nanny is bringing her a bunch of presents to make it all better , then movie night tonight with mommy and daddy ! Tinkerbell and The Great < PROPFEMALE > Rescue :) Having a little girl is so much fun ! I just hope she feels better soon ... 
Baby boy finally has his name : < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > :) 
Apparently < PROPMALE > has mistaken my ribs for monkey bars . Ouch ! 
Umm hello random thunder , I wasn't expecting you at all ... 
Ugh , I have NO energy today and so much to do .... 
Anyone wanna come cook dinner for me ? I give you five dolla . 
< PROPMALE > is pushing on me so hard , I think he's trying to escape ! 
Nothing beats a three hour nap with my < PROPFEMALE > :) 
I think I'm gonna get Lexi some sea monkeys . Couldn't be any harder than a < PROPFEMALE > pet , right ? 
watching 127 Hours with the hubby . Crazy . 
We may assume that the < PROPFIRST > of a resilient child is a \tough skin\ " and the way to achieve it is through \ " tough love . \ " But a tough skin often has a hardened heart . And tough love is an oxymoron . Resilience is about cultivating tenderness to * thrive * in a tough world . A tender heart is the strong core we preserve in our child so he faces the world with equal parts grit and gratitude . -- < PROPFEMALE > Hanessian " 
I can't believe I slept until 2:00 ! Thank you hubby :) 
This house isn't going to clean itself ... but I sure wish it would . 
Is it weird that I never clean during the day , only at night ? I think I was a nocturnal creature in my previous life . 
I'm pretty sure I just heard the sounds of a small creature in my kitchen . I'll be avoiding that area today ... 
I hope these next four weeks to go by fast ! I'm getting antsy and I want to meet this baby boy :) 
I'm grounded from online shopping =/ lol 
You haven't lived until you've witnessed a 2 year old lose her marbles over Blue's Clues . 
Just finished painting < PROPMALE>'s name letters for his room :) I think I'm going to do some new ones for the < PROPFEMALE > ! 
has one super busy day ahead of her ! And the < PROPFEMALE > woke up in a wonderful mood , yay ! She's so cute in the mornings :) 
WOMAN'S ASS SIZE STUDY ... There is a new study about women and how they feel about their asses - the results were pretty interesting . 30% of women think their ass is too fat . 10% of women think their ass is too skinny . The remaining 60% say they don't care , they love him , he's a good man and they wouldn't trade him for the world . I know you're laughing !! Feel free to re post this if you love your ass 
I don't speak English , I speak winninglish . 
Does Sonic still sell bags of their ice ? Please say yes ! 
OMG < PROPMALE > , quit being such a baby !!! 
Going to see Dr. Brown tomorrow , hoping he'll give me some good news ! 
So ... Dr. Brown says < PROPMALE > should be making an appearance within the next two weeks :) Let's hope he's right ! 
Got a full night's sleep last night !!! YAY ! 
Saw a guy with a man-purse at Wal-Mart . Oh , excuse me- it was a \satchel \"." 
Thank you to everyone who came out to < PROPMALE>'s baby shower today ! We are so blessed to have such wonderful family and friends :) 
Finished organizing and putting away his things , room is done , hospital bags are packed- we are 100% ready for baby < PROPMALE > . Whenever you're ready , kid :) 
Cleaning ... story of my life ! 
has one whiny little < PROPFEMALE > on her hands . I hear bedtime calling ! 
Well ... according to Dr. Brown , I'm still pregnant =/ lol 
Whoever said walking could help start labor is a filthy liar . All it does is make my back hurt worse =/ 
So bummed . Woke up at 1:00 a.m. with contractions every 5 minutes for two hours , started to wake up hubby ... then they just fizzled away :/ Damn . 
I really wish < PROPMALE > could understand that he's out of room ! There's nowhere else to go , kid . Seriously ... 
Being a lazy bum today ... naptime :) 
Lexi is singing her heart out with Mumford & Sons . She gets more awesome every day ! :) 
I fully intend to eat an entire fresh pineapple tonight . I really hope this works to send me into labor , because I don't even like pineapple =/ lol 
Stalking Etsy and eating a Snickers . A very productive evening , if I do say so myself . Operation Pineapple has been aborted . lol . 
Sleep now & clean later , or clean now & sleep later ? Decisions , decisions ... 
Dr. Brown at 2:45 ... please give me some good news ! 
Good news ! I'm steadily dilating and baby is fully engaged and ready to go . My doctor isn't expecting me to make it to my appointment next week , so hopefully little < PROPMALE > will be here soon . Don't hold out on me , kid ! 
< PROPFIRST > McDonald , you and your obnoxious suit have ruined my favorite < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > song . I hope you're proud of yourself . 
I know the little monster only wants hugs and kisses over and over to keep from going to bed , but somehow I'm compelled to give in every time :) 
Labor isn't progressing , doctor did a membrane sweep to speed it up . If that doesn't work I'll be induced at 5am tomorrow since my blood pressure is high . Please pray things kick in naturally ! 
Can't sleep =/ Hurting , but feeling okay knowing little < PROPMALE > should be here by this time tomorrow night ! 
< PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Jones was born today , April 1st 2011 at 3:18 in the afternoon , weighing 7 lbs . 5 oz . and 20 inches long . He is absolutely perfect in every way , and we are both doing great . Lexi is doing wonderful as a new big sister ! We are so incredibly blessed :) 
Can't sleep because all I want to do is sit here and stare at this beautiful baby boy ! So grateful to God for my two perfect angels :) 
So proud of < PROPMALE > ! He's already back up to his birthweight and eating like a champ , he's even letting me sleep a bit . He's just so precious ! How do I get blessed with such good babies ? :)
