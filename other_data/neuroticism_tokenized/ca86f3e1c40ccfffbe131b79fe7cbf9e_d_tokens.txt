Life isn't about waiting for the storm to pass , it's about learning to dance in the rain ! Something to think about . 

Anyone good with webcams , I could use some help ! I have called tech support and done a list of other things but still having a distorted picture . 
Very busy day ... I'm getting a lot done ! :) 
Do parents ever stop telling you what to do ? grrr 
School , school , school .... sigh . Finals this week , not fun . 
There are people in this world that take advantage of nice people , they will get what they deserve ... karma is a ***** . 
This sore throat has been trying to slow me down ... I can't let it win . 
Mmmm PF < PROPFIRST>'s for lunch , it was a nice pre graduation lunch with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > . Now I could use a nap . 
The past two days I had a blast at < PROPMALE > Early College Academy . The teachers and students were amazing ! 
Happy Mother's Day !!! It's the 102nd yr of celebrating mom's everywhere . 
My Honda is dead :( so today I am car shopping .... it's fun but a lot of work . The last time I did this my dad and cousin were there to help , that was 10 yrs ago . Wish me luck . 
Elle slept in her bed for the first time last night , hopefully no more crib . 
Had a blast at Schlitterbahn , Elle enjoyed the carousel more than the water rides . 
Enjoyed my time at the spa today . I treated myself to a facial , a belated mothers day/graduation gift . It's nice to do something for myself every once in a while . 
Day 4 off Elle's fever that keeps coming back , waiting for the antibiotics to kick in . 
Just got back from Penn late last night , it was good to get away . We spent some time in NY and NJ . It was Elle's first time at the Jersey shore and the big apple . 
Elle just went on the potty for the first time . I think I'm more excited then I should be , oh well . 
Day 3 of cleaning and organizing this house , it's exhausting ! 
Ahhhh , I woke up with a headache and it's showing no mercy . 
< PROPFIRST > Lohan who ? I CAN'T believe the news coverage being given to a spoiled 20-something yr old . Here are a few 20 year-olds worth knowing about : < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > 23 , < PROPFIRST > Linley 29 , < PROPMALE > Weikert 29 , Justus Bartett 27 , < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > 21 , < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > 21 , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > 26 , < PROPMALE > hew < PROPMALE > 23 , < PROPFIRST > Goeke 23 , & < PROPMALE > Tate 27 . THESE 20-SOMETHINGS GAVE THEIR LIVES FOR YOU THIS WEEK . Repost if you support the Military 
Give me the strength and < PROPFEMALE > to deal with a difficult child today . 
Picked up Blaise 2 days early cause he couldn't behave . \ 
Why would a kid misbehave if he knew he would miss the rest of summer camp and get sent back home ? 
I am so happy , I just found out I passed the test I've been studying so hard for . I can't wait to be in the classroom making a difference in kids lives . :) 
A big thank you to everyone who wished me a Happy Birthday yesterday . It made my day to see messages from friends and family . :) ? 
I am so excited , < PROPMALE > Franz Elementary is great and I hope to get started on Monday ! I'm wondering if I should take the pre-k or title 1 position ? 
I think it's too funny listening to a 7yr old sing with the radio ... lady gaga doesnt sound the same . Blaise likes to dance around his room while belting out the lyrics to < PROPFEMALE > and The Black Eyed Peas . Thank god the song \My Humps\ " isn't on . " 
Fingerprinting done and orientation tomorrow . Looking forward to this new adventure . :) 
First day at Franz Elem . Busy , busy ! 
Loving me some Bears ! Sorry Cowboys not today . 
Sooooo tired ! I don't think I will ever get used to getting up at 5 am . 
One week of being sick is not fun but now elle is coughing and sneezing . Not sure if something blew in with this beautiful weather or if something is going around . 
Had a nice day off , I was able to get most of my to do list done . Maybe I should have added a nap to that to do list . 
I found out that many of my students improved their math scores by 20 to 40 points on the TAKS practice test we took last week . I'm so pleased that after only a few months they are doing much better . 
Day two of christmas break , slowly feeling better but this cough is still hanging on . Also , on the second of day potty training Elle . She is doing better then I thought , no more diapers in this house . 
This week seemed super long , I'm glad the weekend is finally here . On a positive note it helped to have 2 students this week tell me they like coming to see me for math help . 
I found out today that I will be getting a full size classroom next week and I will have enough computers for every student to work on their math . Our campus will be exemplary in no time !
