I have a question : Is it weird to look up someone on facebook you worked with 22 years ago ? 

everybody and everything is an aspect of a grand , single , overriding unity . Separate beings and objects do not exist–that is an illusion peculiar to human beings 
Hi local friends . I am working with a Food service Temp company , and we are looking for about 50 people to make box lunches in Middletown , < PROPFEMALE > . July 19- August 1 , 8am- 4:30 pm . Anyone , you know , looking for extra money send them my way , and I will get them an application , and we will get them working . Job Fares , will be held at the Career Link Offices in Harrisburg(Friday July 9 ) and Lancaster . 
Is anything going on tonight , the wife and kids are away . 
So , I have two job offers . Packing supervisor in a warehouse , no holidays , weekends and $13 an hour . Chef Manager at a health care facility , every other weekend , some holidays and $ 18 an hour . Both have similar schedule . Is the extra money worth giving up some weekends and holidays ? 
Monday back to school for the wife and kids , and I start my new job . We are all very excited . 
Thank you , everyone and Happy < PROPFIRST>'s Day !!
