Music is better with your eyes closed . 
I thought you wanted my lovin ' , \ 
But it's my heart that you stole . \ 
I thought you wanted my money , \ 
But you plundered my soul .

Quite a journey it has been . \

Ein Kinder Garten . 
Something's missing .... 
Gotta start my essay on the book I read half of and the book I didn't read at all ! 
Can you believe it ? I've won more medals in this love game . \ 
I’ve been resting on my laurels . I’m a bad loser\ 
I'm a yard off my pace . \ 
Hhmmm I smell rubber and I soon discovered\ 
That you’re gone for good . \ 
My indiscretions made a bad impression\ 
Guess I was misunderstood . \ 
I thought you needed my loving\ 
I thought you wanted my money\ 
But you plundered my soul 
But age is just a number . And Time , an invention . And though the sun has set on me a thousand times , I still feel as young as the very first time .

Is a bad driver . 
Where did I go wrong ....... 
The Man of Choice . 
Watching some good ole Dragon Ball Z . 
Your head is humming and it won't go , in case you don't know . \ 
The < PROPFEMALE>'s calling you to join him . \ 
Dear Lady , can you hear the wind blow , and did you know\ 
Your stairway lies on the whisperin ' wind . 
The Beatles are now on iTunes ! 
Just do your best . \ 
It's the only way to keep that last bit of sanity . \ 
Maybe I don't have to be good , but I can try to be\ 
At least a little better than I've been so far . 
The music sailed out into the night then upward towards the skies , traveling on that thin border between reality and imagination . 
You can get anything you want , at < PROPFEMALE>'s Restaurant . \ 
Happy Thanksgiving ! 
Are we human ? Or are we dancer ? 
In a way , I'm doing what I've always wanted to do : leave school and hitchhike to < PROPFIRST > . 
Never rode the Ferris Wheel .... 
I love < PROPFEMALE > dieckman ! 
When a man loves a woman\ 
Down deep in his soul She can bring him such misery \ 
If she plays him for a fool\ 
He's the last one to know Lovin ' eyes can't ever see

Amarillo by Morning 
Have you ever noticed that most everything from when we were little kids is gone in one way or another ? 
We all know success when we all find our own dreams\ 
And our love is enough to knock down any wall\ 
And the future's been seen as men try to realize\ 
The simple secret of the note in us all\ 
There once was a note , listen ...... 
Why can't life be normal , fun , and carefree ? \ 
I can't pretend anymore ... 
Who has ACC sociology this semester , 6th period ? 
PLEASE put this as your status if you know someone who has been eaten by dragons . Dragons are nearly unstoppable and , in case you didn't know , they can totally breathe fire . 60% of people WON'T copy and paste this because they have already been eaten by dragons . 38% of people are sitting in the shower armed with fire extinguishers , and the remaining 2% are awesome and will re-post 
Sex 
is awkward . And it seems there's nothing I can do about it . 
You say you're lookin ' for someone\ 
Who's never weak but always strong\ 
To protect you an ' defend you\ 
Whether you are right or wrong\ 
Someone to open each and every door\ 
But it ain't me , babe\ 
No , no , no , it ain't me babe\ 
It ain't me you're lookin ' for , babe 
I just wrote a reggae song in the shower . 
May you have warm words on a cold evening , a full < PROPFEMALE > on a dark night , and the road downhill all the way to your door . 
hmmmm . 
Your sons and your daughters\ 
Are beyond your command\ 
Your old road is rapidly agin ' . \ 
Please get out of the new one\ 
If you can't lend your hand\ 
For the times they are a-changin ' . 
Isn’t it strange how princes and kings , \ 
and clowns that caper in sawdust rings , \ 
and common people , like you and me , \ 
are builders for eternity ? \ 
Each is given a list of rules ;\ 
a shapeless mass ; a bag of tools . \ 
And each must fashion , ere life is flown , \ 
A stumbling block , or a Stepping-Stone . 
Just sat for 45 minutes at the Sac-and Pac pump , waiting for my dad to come with a new car battery . And the windows were stuck rolled down . 
I suck < PROPMALE > real good ! 
In a funk ...... 
When I think back on all the crap I learned in high school , it's a wonder I can think at all . \ 
And my lack of education hasn't hurt me none , I can read the writings on the wall . 
Has the song from the new kingdom hearts commercial stuck in my head , and it bugs me becuase I never beat Kingdom Hearts two . 
I haven't texted in a while ... that's weird . 
Today I completed my childhood by doing a double jump . 
If all my friends were to jump off a bridge ... I wouldn't follow . I'd be at the bottom to catch them ! 
' s < PROPFIRST > smells like < PROPFEMALE > candies . 
I used to not even mind having homework . Now it's just the worst feeling in the world . 
Early Spring , according to Mother Nature , through her humble messenger , the groundhog . 
There's a ladybug in my bathroom , coming in from the cold I guess . 
Campus Radio was an amazing movie . It will go down in history . 
When I have a daughter , I'm going to name her Saria . 
TRANSFORMERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! in july .

We don't need our heads cause our bodies are young . 
She's as sweet as Tupelo < PROPFEMALE > , she's an Angel in the first degree .
