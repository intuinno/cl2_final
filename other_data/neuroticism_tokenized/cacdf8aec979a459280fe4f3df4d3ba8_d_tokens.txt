Freakiest day 2day . Long story short : went to a shop to get fruits . Picked out these awesome strawberries . Took some out of the container & almost ATE one with SPIDER EGGS ! Also found a dead spider in 1 of them ! After I was completely freaked out , I went biking . Passed some tree and a big fuzzy spider gets on my hat ! D: I was flailing my hands around to get it off and almost fell off ! I hate spiders . 
I had a great day with < PROPFIRST > Marks and her bro ! They're vacationing here down in FL 4 5 weeks here with their family from England so I got to < PROPFEMALE > out with them ! We were all swimming in the pool and just chatting away about England , < PROPFEMALE > and some other stuff ! Their British accents r so awesome ! :D Did u know that instead of saying french fries they call them chips ? :o awesome lol 
IF I were to create a small animation ( got a new animation software ) what should it be about ? Like a moral or some sort of story . Any suggestions ?
