Things to do : add more to this thing

Mute the left video and experience ( to quote someone more eloquent than myself ) the finest piece of serendipity on the internet ( some rather violent claymation , as a warning ) http://www.youtubedoubler.com/?video1=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d-tNXxTRBA&video2=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKLpJtvzlEI&h=1 
Wow , Free Comic Book Day ( Bloomington people go to the one in the square , down the street from Subway ) and Free Burrito Day ( at Bajio ) are both today . May is off to a good start . 
Happy < PROPFEMALE > Wars Day , everyone ! May the Fourth be with you ! 
Just watched Sherlock Holmes . Is it just me or was < PROPFIRST > Downey Jr. born to play broken geniuses perfectly ? 
If you don't know where you're going , any road will take you there\

Things today has taught me : when feeling down , taking a walk in the rain is very cathartic :) 
is going to try and explain things a bit better this time . \ 
\ 
Someone I thought I could trust did something really hurtful to me with full knowledge of what was being done . I don't know why this was done , and frankly I don't care . Whatever the intentions , it was done fully knowing what was being done and really showed me who this person really is . \ 
There , I feel a little better now . 
Doctor Who has really been knocking it out of the park left and right this season . I know , you will probably all immediately disregard it as another lame sci-fi show , but this last one was one of the most moving things I have seen in a long time :) 
Got about a hundred pages further in the book I have been reading for a few months now . At this rate , I should be done with my current backlog in about 200 years . 
Yesterday : Went to the comic book shop , drove home singing loudly along to Muppet Bohemian Rhapsody , made some kick-ass spaghetti sauce and meatballs , got some reading done . \ 
Today : went to the animal shelter , going to watch some movies , first one is \Some Like it Hot\ " \ 
had a very introspective week . \ 
Feeling much better now though . 
so then . Just watched Serenity for the first time . I liked it and the series , but it just confirms my suspicion that Joss Whedon hates happiness in all forms . 
Just finished Wishful Drinking by < PROPFEMALE > Fisher . A quick read ( about 2 hours ) , a bit of a downer , but it still ends with a tinge of hopefulness to it . Also gave me this :\ 
\Resentment is like taking poison and waiting for the other person to die\ " \ 
I did some writing in my journal today . \ 
Yes , you were mentioned . \ 
I think you know why . 
Watched Stripes and The Great Outdoors today . Great movies , but it reminded me that < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > died 16 years ago :( 
Just got back from GenCon .... I think I need someone to lead me around on a leash next year . 
Sherlock is really good and I recommend you all watch it . It just ended it's first season ( 3 90 minute episodes ) in the UK and they were great :D 
So then , Friday the 13th . If I am supposed to have worse luck than normal today , I would not recommend standing near me , as I am probably going to be hit by a meteorite . 
Had a good day . Won't go into details here , but the important parts are that Cats are awesome and you all need to see < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim Vs . The World . 
Who wants to help me find a car ? Fun * is guaranteed ! \ 
* fun is not guaranteed 
So apparently < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim has not been doing well in theaters . Here is the plan : go see it or go see it again , and bring 10 million friends . trust me , this will work great . 
just discovered that pomegranate tootsie pops exist . Goodbye teeth ! 
This song is called \I am Sad 
The Tree of < PROPFEMALE > is watered with rational discourse\ 
Truth : I stole this from Fark , but I like it 
so then , single again . \ 
My prediction for the near future : introspection and lots and lots of walks\ 
My prediction for the immediate future : < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST>'s and lots and lots of Robot Chicken . 
new favorite word : Fungible 
aaaaaaand now my car won't start . \ 
Great . 
So I have decided to start a local chapter of SUA : Society for Uncreative Anachronism . I will spend the next week wearing actual period clothing someone like me would have worn a week or two ago . \ 
Note : this may just be a lame excuse for me to not do laundry for another week . 
Today's addition to the \list of parts of a car I do not like\ " : Tires " 
well , the epic battle of Me Vs . A Flat Tire has ended in victory , even though it was a technicality . 
I now have the tools and experience necessary to change a tire , meaning I am now officially a \Knight in Shining Armor® . \ " This means that I am now accepting applications for the position of \ " Princess . \ " Get yours in now to take advantage of special holiday rates ! " 
I think it is going to be a good week . 
My Mom's dog is sleeping behind me . I think I am going to miss him when my Mom's new place is ready :( 
Operation Ugly Scarf is GO ! 
Things that I have learned about recently :\ 
Hashing ( thanks to < PROPFEMALE > Holen)\ 
Vajazzling ( thanks , albeit indirectly , to < PROPFEMALE > Moore)\ 
Knitting ( thanks to my Mom ) 
kinda want to curl up into a ball and pretend most of today just didn't happen . who is with me ? 
Action\ 
is better than gestures . Changing your avatar is a gesture . Donating 5\ 
or more dollars to a reputable anti child abuse < PROPFEMALE > of your choice \ 
is action . And if there's anything cartoons do well , it's action . 
number 3.14159 : You are so vain , I bet you think this status update is about you . 
alright , just made an MP3 CD of about 80 songs for some friends for X-mas ( with only 2 x-mas songs ) . \ 
Anyone else who wants a copy , let me know . I'll even mail it if need be . 
< PROPFIRST > Conniff Now that she's single I could ask < PROPFEMALE > Johansen out but I'm humble enough to admit I'm only the 2nd sexiest man alive . \ 
Mostly testing out tagging people in posts , but also you should all Turn Your Cranks To < PROPFIRST > ( or be his friend on Facebook ) 
so then , free movies at the Bishop tomorrow night . Anyone want to go ? 
Okay fine . \ 
I laughed at the Cars 2 trailer , specifically at a line from < PROPFIRST > The Cable Guy\ 
Go on , judge me . You know you want to . 
so I have come to a conclusion thanks to some other people at work :\ 
The universe is actually run by a large group of drunken midgets in space with < PROPFEMALE > hammers . \ 
It makes perfect sense if you think about it .
