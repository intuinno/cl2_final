If there is one thing i hate in the world , it is lazy people who take advantage of things they do not deserve . 
Whoever knew having a hear t-t o-heart conversation would make you feel so good :3 
Why the hell do i smell chicken !? No one is eating chicken , yet it smells like it's being cooked or eaten right next to me >_< 
Just had me some blueberry waffles without syrup . Now the opening theme from Xyber-9 keeps playing in my head :P

6 . My favorite thing about you . \ 
7 . Give you a weird nickname . \ 
8 . I Challenge you to post this . 
Tonight has been one of the most eventful nights i've had in a while xD 
I'm too sleepy to do much else . I'm about to call it a night . >:3

< PROPMALE > Hawkeye I will hit you up after i finish cleaning my back yard . Shouldn't take more than an hour 
Sad Den :\ 
Why does it always have to be this way :( 
I believe this whole Bin Laden death is the start of the downward spiral that is 2012 . The world will soon learn its fate in the coming months -_- 
Here am i floating in my tin can\ 
Far above the moon\ 
Planet Earth is blue\ 
and there's nothing i can do ... 
I almost got fined for not appreciating < PROPFEMALE > O_o 
Criticizing my < PROPMALE > is one thing , but saying that my skills are linked to my passion is another . I'm not going to say that my < PROPMALE > is the best out there , but i consider it to be alright . Don't attempt to push your standards on me by belittling my skills . If that's the case let me see a drawing that trumps mine . Until then please hold your silence O_o 
Can someone explain to me how \Right next to the chicken spot\ " is an exact address ? -_-" 
There are two things i hate in the world the most :\ 
1 ) The lack of thoroughly given instructions . \ 
2 ) When people tell me i did not do what they asked after i , in fact , do what they asked . 
Big moves are in the workings : Those who have been afflicted and frowned upon will find refuge in a haven away from the Chaos of the old world . \ 
-The Book of Dandin : Chapter 1 Verse 5 
I ask la ' mere for advice in stuff and she keeps up bringing up semi-valid points that don't completely pertain to me . And then people wonder why i never open up to them . If i asked to be criticized to the point that the conversation deviates from the intended direction , i would have spoken to Oprah or Judge < PROPFEMALE > . O_o 
So i had a mini movie night-breaker with the following line-up :\ 
1 ) Hey Arnold ! : The Movie\ 
Forgot that it was a movie , but enjoyed the last 2/3 of it . \ 
2 ) Lord of the Rings : The Fellowship of the Rings\ 
First time watching it . For some reason i avoided the trilogy growing up , but now i can say that it's pretty cool . \ 
3 ) The Legend of 1900\ 
Very interesting film . Has a good start and a pretty sad ending . [ I approve ] 
Alright . I was afflicted with an odd pain in my chest yesterday . I tried sleeping it off , but when i woke up i found that it moved to my back . Any tips on what to do here ? I am trying very hard not to panic . 
i'm officially annoyed . This kid came out of nowhere , dropped my mouse , and backed out of my duel .... 
On the last stretch of my The Lord of the Rings Marathon . Just got past the first half of \The Return of the King\ " and i'm just amazed . Gandalf is just epic . I wanna be like him when i grow up . \ 
AND THE WORLD HAS NOT ENDED ! \ 
-Points at Fail Pastor with a lit pitchfork-\ 
GET HIM !!!!!! >:O 
I just had the best Power Rangers dream ever ! My mind came up with a Ranger so epic he makes the other characters belled when he shoots them >:D 
Just finished Inseption for the first time . One of the best movies ever >:D 
I swear ... The fact that people really woke me up to look for directions on mapquest truly blew mine . D:< 
Good News ! I'm back online ! :D \ 
Bad News ! I forgot the password to my e-mail account , as well as several other accounts and information previouslyon the PC T T__T T 
Give me your honest opinion : Do you think i'm complacent ? 
I have heard it all : It's my fault that my little brother's money went missing because i let one of my grandma's children into his room . 
18 days left before i begin a journey that will decide my fate . People are besides themselves in happiness for all of the wrong reasons , but what can one say ? Let the < PROPFEMALE > be < PROPFEMALE > . ^_^ 
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh ~ \ 
I'm so excited ! \ 
Someday Someday Leeds United ! \ 
5 Years ago today was the Day of the Beast ..... 
It seems that someone's poly amorous relationships have caught up to their man-whoring habits . A sad day in this guy's life -smh- 
:( ~ Sigh ~ 
Why is it that so may people are letting me down ? >_< 
I was one of the unlucky few to get rained on , but at least that helped in clearing up my bad mood :D 
The Voltron Force has been remade ?! Where was i when this happened ? 
Nine days remain before i leave . Who wants to go to the buffet during the week or weekend to chill and stuff ? 
i swear , my parents do things just to piss me off ... tell me to clean the bathroom and use it the same minute i start working on it . really ?!
