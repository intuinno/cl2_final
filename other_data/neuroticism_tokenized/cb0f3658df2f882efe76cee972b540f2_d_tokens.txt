loves when family comes to visit , and wishes that their stay would never end 
3 days camping on Hood = happiness 
had a blast shooting < PROPFEMALE > & Kean's wedding , what a fantastic , genuine couple- thanks for the memories guys !

packing for urban exposure ; anyone gonna be in/near/around Seattle over the next week + wanna < PROPFEMALE > ? 
loves Seattle in the summer : Arab festival , flamenco show , & drive-in movies- whata weekend :) 
a night at the Torsets \cabin\ " on Vashon- what a treat to be able to kayak from your front yard ! " 
always nice to start the day w/ a nice paddle :) 
is completely addicted to The Tudors ; salacious , dark , twisted and visually opulent . Thanks Showtime , you've done it again ! 
figures that the first cloudy night all summer was during the peak of the meteor shower ! 
mindless , hip-numbing work : sorting wood from composite shingles- eventually my yard will look like it should- and not like the construction zone it is ! 
one of the beauties of photography- i'm sitting in my office & re-visiting Croatia ! god i love the medium ... 
can't sleep , might as well edit !

the dogs and i went out last night to shoot the lightning , they took off , < PROPMALE > came back w/ 8 porcupine quills stuck into her muzzle and one BETWEEN her incisors in her gums ! poor girl , lucky for her , momma carries an incredibly random selection of stuff in her car , including the antique needle-nose pliers that did the job . 
< PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > is one funny mother fucker 
is addicted to Casablanca- to such an extent that i woke up w/ \As Time Goes By\ " playing in my head this morning "

wishes that the \long exposure noise reduction\ " setting on the 40D wasn't so ... what's the word ? draining ? time-consuming ? nerve-wracking ? gonna have to buy an f'n battery pack if i wanna keep shootin ' the stars " 
a weekend of staining decking 
woke up to the signs of what must have been a difficult night for one of the doggies- diarrhea and vomit in the kitchen , pantry and living room ... lovely way to start the day 
' s clothes dryer is officially dead 
VERY IMPORTANT : I NEED MAILING ADDRESSES !!! please send me yours- this is to send out something good , NOT to add you to an annoying mailing list ! :) 
summer seems to be officially over- a weekend of working in the rain ... at least the roof is done !! :) 
the yellow-jackets are relentless !!! they're all getting their fuck on , and wouldn't let us work ! 
hates it when people ask for opinions , and then either don't listen or don't really want any answer other than \it's perfect \"" 
can't wait to see < PROPFIRST > Black perform tomorrow night ! 
' s right shoe was inhabited by a yellow jacket , and now her big toe hurts :( 
the deer busted into the garden and ate down my jungle of strawberries !! and my cucumber , and ate all the leaves off of the grapes !!! BOOO HOO !!! 
watching a doc about the making of the Dark Side album : the amazing vocals on \The Great Gig in the Sky\ " were improvised ! the singer was asked to think about darkness and death ... incredible "

what is this ?!?!? a center for ants ?? how can we be expected to teach children to learn how to read , if they can't even fit inside the building ? I don't want to hear your excuses , the center has to be at least ... 3 times bigger than this ! 
you've got to cry w/o weeping , talk w/o speaking , scream w/o raising your voice ...

it's interesting to be witness to a tree's decomposition : a year+ ago , the < PROPMALE > snag outside my office ( The Condo Tree ) lost the magic whirl on it's trunk . As of the snow storm , it's lost one of it's few remaining huge limbs- the middle trunk- a massive section ( fortunately it missed the power lines ! ) .

one of the reasons that i love where i live : yesterday , the doctors suggested that i get crutches , today , my dad found something in the shop , we MacGyverd it , and now i've got a crutch ! 
ugh ... Augmentin and Cipro burps ... gross 
the INSIDE of my foot itches !!!! AARRRGGGHHHH !!!! and not the inside , like , the inside of the arch ... inside like , at the bone level !!! guess that means it's healing , but good lord !!!

COOL STORY : i got an email late last night from someone who saw a photo of my house on flickr . He contacted me , and said that the house looks a lot like a house that his aunt has a painting of- the house that his great grand parents lived in !!! turns out , that his g.g. parents were ( possibly ) even the ORIGINAL owners of my 1892 home !!!! how cool is that ??? here's hoping that his family has some old photos ... :) 
an adoption theme on a < PROPMALE > network show ??? alright , i'm officially a fan of Glee ... 
HAPPY HOLIDAY EVERYONE ;) if you don't know what i'm talking about , please don't ask ...!

has been on hold w/ adobe for 2 hours ... bad jazz , and frustration 
from a NY Times article by < PROPFIRST > Cohen : Conservative media , Mr. Sanchez wrote , referring to outlets like Fox News and National Review and to talk show stars like Rush Limbaugh , < PROPFIRST > Levin and < PROPFIRST > Beck have “become worryingly untethered from reality as the impetus to satisfy the demand for red meat overtakes any motivation to report accurately . ”

random thought of the day : has anyone else out there read and loved The Sparrow ? one of my all time favorite books , rumored that < PROPMALE > Pitt's production company has bought the rights and might be coming out w/ a movie version in 2012 ... 
random thought of the day : i'm watching < PROPMALE > Burns ' doc about WW2 , and can't help but wish that i could jump ahead 60 years to watch a thoughtful doc examining/ looking back at our current issues ... 
driving back from pdx yesterday , at the eastern end of the old hw , there was an accident- a dramatic one at that- a semi , that looked as though the front half had exploded ! kicker was that it took 1hr 15mins to get 3 < PROPMALE > 
METEOR SHOWER TONIGHT ; < PROPFEMALE > sets at 10 , there were some incredible ones ( w/ looooooooooooooong tails ) last night , tonight is the peak . If you're in the neighborhood , c'mon out :)

of the 12 people running for various offices in Klickitat County ( assessor , auditor , county clerk , prosecuting attorney , sheriff and treasurer ) only 2 of them \prefer democratic party\ " !!! where am i living ?!?!?! " 
please envision my < PROPFEMALE > coming home 
thank you owls for not eating < PROPMALE > :) 
any other photogs out there facing this issue ? i was approached via flickr , and was asked for one-time-use-rights to print an image w/ no offer of compensation . Bums me out , feels disrespectful and rude to assume that the ones who create the work are then not worthy of payment ! i know that print is suffering , but is it fair to take that out on the artists and professionals that they rely on ? 
is so grateful for guys that can fix things
