Damn almost overslept ... off to work 
Is headed to this meeting , I hope we get something accomplished this time .. 
* Real Talk PSA * Don't get mad cause someone doesn't want to talk to you , holla at you , fuck with you , fuck you , date you , or be in a relationship with you !

Also , that your hair is properly cornrowed . And please make sure that the wig is placed just before your natural hairline . BTW if the person putting it on is not charging you , they DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING !! #thatisall 
There is big talk about what people put on FB . Some say they should keep it to themselves . I personally believe that FB is how people talk to their friends , family they don't talk to everyday . I say post the good and the bad about your life to the people you want to tell your business to . For those who don't like what's in their news feed , hit the remove friend button and it all goes away ... * think about it * 
* Real Talk * * Fact about me * If I call you my friend , if there's anything I can help you with , I will . It don't matter how mad I may get at you ... unless you fucked with my money ... then I don't have nothing at all to say but where's my money . 
Is feeing ... 
* Real Talk * When you love someone so much that it hurts , its time to let that person go . Yes , it will hurt to let them go but the pain will lessen over time . If you never let go , it hurts forever .

* Real Talk * Only I know what I've been thru , what I'm going thru and where I'm trying to get to . Self-preservation is at the top of my list .

Is up and off to work cause I don't sit around waiting for someone else to take care of me ...

Can't sleep * crying * ... I'm worried about my best friend and confidant . You were always there when I needed you and in your time of need , they won't let me near you . Even though you are closer to me than my own immediate family . I pray that you are still with us , but even if you are walking with God/Allah , you will always be in my heart . I love you , Yah . 
Is on my way home after wondering around work for 2 hours ... my homie on my mind ... not knowing is the worst feeling in the world ... I just want to hear his voice again ... 
I keep calling your phone hoping that you will answer ... please answer somehow ... 
Looking back over the last few days , I finally figured out why I was so restless ... I hadn't heard from my true blue homie ... and I still haven't heard from him . I'm really hurting right now ... 
Someone asked me what's a \True blue homie\ " this is my meaning of the phase : Its a true friend . Someone who knows you inside out and most times better than you know yourself . A true friend that is always with you no matter who or what you are and will defend you to the end no matter who they piss off . " 
* CRYING * I WILL NEVER EE MY FRIEND AGAIN ! 
You were my best friend in the world . Now , I have to go on without you in my life . You were like a big brother to me . Helping me and guiding me on my journey . I never really got to tell you but I love you and you will always have a place in my heart . Freaky Fam in life and death . Rest in Peace my friend . 
Is eating only cause I hear him in my ear saying , \Eat Big Booty . Gotta get your weight up . \"" 
Is about to eat something , get my scooby snack and pop my bottle and have a going away party ... I will miss you , Yah-Ya . 
* outside looking in * I know you going thru it right now . All will miss him . He is walking with Allah right now . He doesn't have to go thru the BS anymore . He chillin with Grandpa . Just remeber what they both taught you : NEVER GIVE UP . PUT ONE FOOT IN FRONT THE OTHER . YOU CAN HAVE ANYTHING YOU WANT BUT YOU HAVE TO WORK FOR IT . Remember both the good and bad and learn from it . 
Is up and still hasn't awaken from the nightmare that is my life ... I miss you homie . I know , I'm going to go vote . 
I will never forget my baby . In heaven we will be together again . I love you and save me a seat . * kiss * 
You will forever be in my heart and on my mind . I remember all our talks . I will make you proud . Keep watch over all you loved ones cause we all love you and will miss you . 
* Real Talk * Show your loved ones that you appreciate them ... you never know when they're gonna go . 
I knew change was coming but I did want you included . I wanted you to be there to share the times . The good and the bad . I know are now on the sidelines cheering me on . Thank you for everything . 
* sigh * * refreshing my tequilla sunrise * 
I still know all is not right in the world ... I'm up earlier than I was yesterday * sigh * I still miss you but you will always be with me in spirit . Someone told me once that I never had a friend . Even though you have left this life , you are still showing me that you were always my friend and that I have people who are still there . Thank you everyone . 
This Orange Sherbet Cooler is for you homie . Yeah I still remember how to make it and that its your favorite . 
From 12am to 2am is gonna be a hard time period for me now ... I can't call my best friend and trip about the day anymore . I still love you even though you left . I understand what you were here to do is completed . Rest now my friend . I will see you Friday . * kiss * 
* Business 101 * It takes money to make money . You cannot cut cost and expect to maintain selling a good product . You have to do maintenance . If your equipment and methods become outdated , you HAVE TO UPGRADE . The money you spend now will come back ten fold . Now if only the government can understand this concept . 
As I prepare to say goodbye , I think of all the times we shared . The laughs and the tears , even the snot bubbles lol . I thank the Lord for sending you in my life . You made a huge impact in my life and I will always honor your memory ... and yes , I will keep them in check . 
Is walking down the street in Philly ... I'm not ready to say goodbye just yet ... 
I'm still waiting for you to pop up and say I'm just joking y'all ...

Nobodies DNA matched but the police kept scaring the guys into confessing ... they finally found who did it & the guys who didn't even do anything got convicted anyway ... WOW !!!!! * lesson learned * If you didn't do the crime : SAY YOU WANT A LAWYER !!!!!!!! 
* fact about me * I am a nerd at heart and I relax by watching educational programming ... #Now watching a program on Japanese natural scenery .

See you on the other side when I get there . We will have a lot to discuss when I do . Peace & Love . 
Just woke up again . This pain is not cool . I couldn't even drink the new moscato I brought at work today . Thank you Baby for staying on the phone with me to make sure I was ok . I'm going back to sleep ... 
ROTFLMFAO at this dude < PROPFIRST > on < PROPFIRST > Springer . This shit is fucking HILARIOUS !!!!!!!! 
< PROPFIRST > is really doing the thang . Now the nerdy guy gets to date the pretty girl . And I was gonna change the channel cause I didn't want to watch strippers fight ... hope I don't speak to soon ... 
< PROPFIRST > dropping that knowledge . I ended up back on < PROPFIRST > ... I need to get some cable . 
Will not let the dumb shit get on my nerves . You don't respect me now , just wait til I'm your boss ... haters will not stop me from achieving my dreams . \You are the weakest link . Goodbye ! \"" 
Sitting on a moonlit beach with the clear , blue water lapping at my toes with my baby by my side without a care in the world is the best dream a girl can have . It is what fuels my drive to work harder . 
The devil wont stop me from being the good person I am inside . In the last month I lost the two closest people to me . One by choice and the other by force . But I still have good friends & fam in my life and I'm so thankful for them . The fact that last year this time the only thing I barely had was a job . I have my own place , car , job and man that loves me for me . I could ask for more but I'm willing to work for it ! 
Wasn't gonna cook at first cause I didn't have to for the first time in long time ... then I thought about it , I have me to cook for . Thankgiving feast for me : Cornish Hen in a Cream of Mushroom sauce , Mashed potatoes , Green Beans , Biscuits and a Made from Scratch Sweet Potato Pie . Lunch tomorrow is gonna be great ! 
Wonders why people don't fully get to know all about a person when they decide to have children with a person ? Maybe people don't actually change and show who they can be until that life changing event happens . * something to ponder * 
Is having a drink . One of the best days I've had this year ... can't wait to have many more , but I'm so thankful for what I have be through in my life . It taught me how to be a better person . 
Is at work . There is a bad < PROPFEMALE > in here today and I think I know where its coming from ... 
So much to achieve .. \ 
. so little time to achieve it in . 
Has a tamed wild animal that wishes to be set totally free . Too bad that can't happen ... its a blessing and a curse # < PROPFIRST > 
* Real Talk * There is a thin line between Love and Hate . If you decide to cross it , make sure its worth crossing . 
Is at work on break freezing my ass off . Sun went down and it got cold like we in the desert . DAMN ! 
Is SMDH ... Niggas have got the game I play twisted . I have no problems with cutting a muthafucker off . * Real Talk * 
* fact about me * I keep trying to tell people I'm unlike any female that you will come across . I am an unique individual . Some things I will not negotiate on . The way I handle my business is one of them . 
Is in the crib chillaxing after the nap I had ... now I'm trying to figure out what I'm going to eat : leftovers or cereal . I'm feeling real lazy and don't even feel like using the microwave . 
Ok ... after laying here for awhile , I decided on the cereal cause I don't feel like dealing with all the work associated with the leftovers . 
Is up and about to make my baby this sweet potato pie ... again . 
I hate 5 o'clock traffic with a passion ! 
Is stuck at work til 2am ... imma be straight chilling . 
is waiting for my baby to get home from school so I can go get my feet done . My poor toes need some TLC ... 
Is at work thinking of what to do for my baby's birthday !! 
Has a rant I want to go on but my break ain't long enough . I'll post it when i get in for the night . Its some extended * Real Talk * Stay tuned .

Damn , at work at 11 and don't have to be there til 12:30 . Haha * walking back out the door * 
Ok ... I think I will play the < PROPFIRST > game . I guess I can play on fb game witcha ! Inbox your < PROPFIRST > ... 
#3 * smile * You bring joy to my life in a way I never thought another person would . You are caring , loving , smart , patient , funny , and crazy just like I am . I always knew there was something about you that I would love . It took me so long to admit it because I never wanted to be one of the people who caused you pain . I hope that I never will . I love you . * kiss * 
#121 and #709 You impatient as hell ! Lol Naw , for real you are one of the coolest chicks that I have had the pleasure of meeting . I even fucks wit the alter ego . And coming from me that's amazing cause I usually don't like chicks with the same name . 
#720 You were one of the few female friends that I had in high school . Thanks for being you . Stay away from those crazy as niggas . 
#32 You are a cool dude . I wish that I had more time to get to know you better . 
#550 Even though we met like we did , I consider you a friend . Stay real . 
#33 You two do think alike . LOL I'm glad that I have had the pleasure of knowing you . I look forward to the family visits for the holidays .

#895 You are a great guy . Trust me when its your time love will come your way . Until then , stay cool . 
#804 You are a mad cool dude . Its not often that i met a guy that works like i do . I'm glad that I've gotten to spend some time around you . I hope that we can get together and have a drink sometime . In between jobs of course . Lol 
#56 I remember you from school but I don't know much about who you are now . Maybe we could keep in touch better . 
#81 Its nice to know there are still some real men out there . Thanks . 
#82 We drifted apart when I moved across town but I still miss those times we used to < PROPFEMALE > out . Maybe we could get together one day and talk about the old days . 
#12 Stay just that way you are , fabulous ! 
#2101 I don't really know anything about you ... maybe time will change that . 
Ok ... that's it for the #'s game . No more < PROPFIRST > . If you didn't send one , too damn bad !! 
Its sad how we as americans break our necks to help people all over the world , but don't give two fucks about people who are standing right next to us . There are so many peoplle right here at home that need help but we refuse to help them . We need to help ourselves before we can help others outside our boarders . 
Has realized that I don't sleep that well without him by my side ... well I will < PROPFEMALE > the good nights of sleep that I do get cause I will NOT mess this up by rushing into anything ... slow and steady wins the race ... * smile * a race that it seems like I've already won ... 
Decided to play the other side of the # game while I'm on my way to work 
Will be cleaning out the car on my lunch break ... SMH I work too much

* Real Talk * Life has a funny way of helping you out 
Of course I make it to the area early just to sit in line . They better hurry the hell up ! 
You know its cold when you can see your breath while sitting in the car with the doors and windows closed .

Is in the crib chillin watching Family Guy ... missing my honey ... soon it will be all about \us \"..." 
* Fact About Me * I'm the nicest person you will ever meet ... until you anger me . Then I'm just an evil ass bitch . 
With another hour and 10 mins to go ... I'm so ready to go ... 
Remember this Christmas , while you are eating your dinners and laughing with your loved ones , that in another house there is an empty chair where a hero should be sitting . They gave their life so that you can sit with your family . So light a candle this Christmas for our fallen heroes that did not make it back and for those still serving in Iraq and Afghanistan . Repost this as your status to show your respect

Random thought : Guys with good sex wonder why we females can leave them alone so easily when we find a man that's willing to be with us outside of the bedroom even though the sex ain't the same ... * something to ponder * 
YAY !! The Lions are on !!!

is sitting here with my baby listening to some music ... thinking of some * Real Talk * 
* Real Talk * Don't bite the hand that feeds you . You will look dumb when you end up starving .

Stop using that baby 2 make that man life miserable . Da man don't want you . You cant get 2 whats in front of you cause you 2 busy lookin back to see what he's doin . That aint your future . It is your past , so leave it alone . Whatever he doin with her is his business . Move on 2 get 2 what God got for you and leave this where its at . A grown man takes care of his child w/o nobody tellin him he needs to take of his child 
A customer today told me that she hopes that I find the man of my dreams . I told her , I have already found him . 
is sitting here alone eating cookies and drinking milk , waiting on my baby to come home so we can exchange gifts ... I really wonder whats in this box in front of me ... 
is remembering the Christmas days from my youth . My mom never wrapped anything . She said it was \a waste of time and paper . \ " She also said \ " Dont believe that a fat white man will bring you anything . I work hard to give you all that you have . You have to work hard to get what you want cause no one is just going to give it to you for nothing . \ " * Lesson Learned * " 
Is about to finish of the other half of this bottle of Moscato ...

Keeps my profile open so everyone who chooses to see what's on my mind can ... even the haters . Maybe I can show them how to keep a good man * smile * I said I was gonna be nice , so I will keep my thoughts on my < PROPFEMALE > only .

Since my baby has gone to work , I guess I will entertain myself by posting some * Real Talk * 
* Real Talk * When you have a good man taking care of you , practice the 3 F's . Feed him , Fuck him AND shut the Fuck up ! 
* Real Talk * If you bold enough to respond , be woman enough not to remove it . 
* Real Talk * Don't be mad cause I'm prettier than you . 
* Real Talk * If you got something to say to me , say it to me . I give haters the < PROPMALE > to say whats on their minds . 
* Real Talk * If you have kids with a good man and you ain't woman enough to keep him happy , don't get mad at the woman that makes him happy . Go find you a man that you CAN make happy . 
* Real Talk * You don't have to call CSE to make a real man take care of his kids . He does it automatically . He owes you nothing . He gives his kids the world . 
* Real Talk * You need to get a life if you call just to bitch about who he sleeping with . Don't worry about that . It ain't you . 
* Real Talk * Yes , I am LMAO at you cause you funny . 
damn I maybe out of * Real Talk * ... Not !

For those just tuning in , on doing some extensive * Real Talk * I'm going ham tonight to keep myself entertained until my baby comes home ...

* Real Talk * I have better stuff to do than to sit here and talk about you , but I know you are going to read this cause you have nothing else better to do . Go find a life and stop being bitter . Its not a good look . 
* Real Talk*Females that act like bitches need to take that shit out on the niggas that did them dirty . If they continue to act like that with the next man , they will find themselves old and alone . It really ain't cute . Real men don't want or deserve to deal with the drama . 
\I married Rambo . \"" 
I LOVE the Tango !! 
LOL this is going to be the last one for the night ... 
* Real Talk * This is 2011 . If you are still worried about what and who your ex is doing , go find a head doctor cause you are a several cards short of a full deck . 
The first thing my baby said to me when I woke up this morning was , I thought you said you loved me . I do love you < PROPFEMALE > but I just couldn't help myself . People stop being nosy and stay off my < PROPFEMALE > they will have no reason to bitch . Now will they ? Good morning FB Fam !

* Real Talk * Most people don't appreciate what they have until its gone . 
If you are holding on to past hurts and pains ..... \ 
LET IT GO !! 
If you have a bad attitude ....... \ 
LET IT GO !!! 
If you keep judging others to make yourself feel better ...... \ 
If you are struggling with the healing of a broken relationship ....... \ 
If you keep trying to help someone who won't even try to help themselves ...... \ 
Let the past be the past . Forget the former things . \ 
GOD is doing a new thing for you ! \ 
Get Right or Get Left .. think about it , and then .... \ 
has had a really comical day today . I have learned that there are still some real childish people in the world and they really need to grow up . SMH Oh well . I guess its how life balances itself out . There are smart people and there are the not so smart people . Hopefully , people learn that its not all about you . There are others around you who have to deal with you and nobody wants to deal with that dumb shit . 
* Real Talk * Be careful of what you wish for ... You just might get it . Right along with a whole new set of problems . 
* Fact about Me * If you think I am being smart , I am . I have an IQ of like 128 and the Real Life experience to back it up . * Graduate of The School Of Hard Knocks *

I love my man ... lol he keeps a smile on my face . We think alike but he always finds ways to surprise me ! Thank you baby ! 
* Question * Why does the ex always says that she's fucking him too when you and her know damn well he ain't ? What's the point when its a known lie ? Is she just trying to make the new girl mad or is she just that damn stupid and desperate ? Im just throwing the ? out there to see what you're thoughts are ...

As I sit here all alone , I think about all the things that I have been thru in my life and I thank the Lord for bring me this far . I miss the child that I never got to have but I know that it was best that he/she didnt make it because I wouldnt have opened my eyes to the love of my life . I would have been stuck in the world of BD drama or jail . I understand the lessons that the Lord have placed in front of me . 
To all the women who have children : stop looking for what you feel is owed . The Lord has given you something valuable , ( a ) child(ren ) to care for . You were blessed with gifts that not all women can have . What is done is done . Take care of what you have . If you are blessed to have ( a ) child(ren ) by a good man , stop being a bitch because you are more blessed than other mothers that struggle to survive . 
I love me some him just because after all these years , he still makes me smile and he always found me when I disappeared . I still wish that I would have stayed in 04 but I had to go . I wont disappear anymore . You dont have to find me anymore because I will be here waiting for you . 9/29/12 
needs to shed a few tears . I think I would feel better , but the other part of me wont let me . * Torn *
