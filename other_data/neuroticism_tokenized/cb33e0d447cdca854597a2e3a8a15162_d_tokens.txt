Awesome ... so every other person in my section is getting pca'd to different units , I'm the only one left , and I don't know < PROPFIRST > about my work . Three days to learn everything . Great ... 
WHY IS THE DAMN BLENDER LEAKING ?!!? 
< PROPFEMALE > just made an amazing Peruvian chicken and rice meal . So good !!! 
i cant believe the buzz that my main pic is making . its just a caveman lifting a sabertooth fat ass ... 
Inspiration is preceded by initiative . It rarely takes the initiative to inspire you beforehand . 
Tonigh , i really whooped the first solo on the song that im learning , had some beer , and watched my wife try on a bunch of her new bras she bought . life is good for a wednesday lol 
Tomorrow is Friday , and it is a half day at work , thank goodness ...

A Veteran is someone , who at one point in \ 
their life , wrote a blank check payable to the United States of < PROPFEMALE > \ 
for an amount up to , and including , their life . That is an honor , and \

that fact . Copy and paste this as your status ... if you are a Veteran

So i cancelled my order for the Krank Rev Jr. .. and put a Peavey 6505 on order through Guitar Center !!!! should be here in two days !!!

spent the 4th sitting under the washington monument watching a huge fireworks display in a sea of humanity . let me tell you ... disney world , universal studios , and six flags combined would NEVER equal the amount of people that were waiting in \line\ " to get on the metros and go home ... holy crap ... " 
finally spent a lil money on the mustang ... tinted windows , shifter knob , steering wheel cover , seat covers ... and cant forget the fuzzy dice !

i love it ... finally finish the CMR , now im told i have a CFT tomorrow morning ... oh wait ... im scheduled for a CFT during my annual training two days later . The response from the head shed ? \well you arent required to take either for score . \ " i love it ... " 
i dont care who your are . everyone needs to get the new black label society album . its mandatory for life and stuff . 
so apparently , when psychiatrists are prescribing you zoloft , its not a requirement that they inform you that if you ever stop taking it , youll go through withdraws like a crackhead . what a weekend this has been ... 
so a stray cat follows us home , we bring it in and give it food , then it starts hauling ass all over our bathroom , growling and drooling ... yeah ... his ass went right back outside ...

100 reps of powercleans , 22 minutes of cardio on a row machine , 88 reps of kettle ball sumo squats and medicine ball throws ...

to the driver of the mitsubishi eclipse that i smoked tonight : its said that in the rain , on a wet road with bald tires , even AFTER you tried to jump the gun on me , that I still managed to pull a car length on your ass between the stoplight and 60 mph . If you spent more time turning wrenches and behind the wheel , and less time beating off over < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > in the fast and the furious , you might have had a < PROPMALE > son ! 
cant wait to get the hell out of work and install the new wheels and brake caliper covers on the mustang . pics will be up soon . 
incredible ... i've had my car for five years and in that time ive had maybe 3 random compliments on it . i put new wheels on it and ive had someone say good things about it everyday for the past 2 weeks ! 
you know its a good session of racquetball when you tear your skin open while competing 
ok enough is enough ... yes , a < PROPMALE > got married , big deal . airing it live was enough . i work overnight , and i'm sick and tired of seeing all these recaps of these boring ass english people having a big boring ass english wedding incessantly !
