Finally got a facebook , after much nagging ! Now if only I could figure this darn thing out ! 

Woo ! At a sweet sixteen , with five friends , and loving it ! It's really nice here , but the AC is freeeeeeeeeezing ! 
Yay for procrastinating on painting and going on liking sprees instead ! 
I wish I was back at camp ! It was so much fun , and being back home is just plain boring D: 
Yeah ! My Birthday is officially in Four days ! \ 
Crud ... I never planned a party ! D: We'll have to fix that ! 
99% of teenagers would cry if they saw < PROPFIRST > Bieber standing on top of \ 
askyscraperabout to jump . If you are the 1% sitting there with popcorn \ 
and 3Dglasses , screaming \DO A BACKFLIP ! \ " 
POKE me if you ever had a crush on me . LIKE\ 
this status if you think im a good friend . MESSAGE me if you ever \ 
wanted a relationship with me . COMMENT on this if we have had good \ 
memories . if you're brave , put this as your status 
Went to publix after getting my new phone ! First thing I see ? A < PROPMALE > Potter Theme Park poster . I turned on my ipod when I got home . First thing to come on ? The HP soundtrack . I wonder if its a sign ... 
Man ... gotta stop liking a bunch of random stuff ! lol . Who else is addicted to that stuff ? 
Yes !!!!!!!! It's my birthday !!!!!!! go me ~ <3 u mom ! Thanks for all your hard work , and happy \labor day\ " ! ( thanks < PROPFEMALE > for the pun :] ) " 
zhcgjs wihefwk hwe rwudsg wegerh g yewgruye sdyf yts\ 
\ 
--- my cat < PROPFEMALE > decided she wanted to send everyone a message , so who am I to say no ? \ 
now if I only knew what she typed ... 
Stayed home today for my birthday and made cupcakes with my grandma . It was boring , all in all , but at least my sister came to visit . 
Well , I had my very first EVER handling class today , and it was fun ! I handled Mr. < PROPMALE > and he behaved well for me , imo , and everyone said I did well for my first time . I still broke out in hives from handling a male dog , but I'm sure it'll go away sometime . 
I found out a book I've been waiting for is coming out soon a\ 
few weeks ago , and I checked to see if I can preorder it . I can ! Just my \ 
luck , the author will sign it ! I was sure I'd order \ 
it . I remembered this morning , so I grabbed all my gift cards to see how \ 
much was on them . What I found out ? \ 
My gift card had $10.07 on it , when the book costs $10.25 . \ 
So . Not . Fair . \ 
Looks like I'll have to ask mom :P 
Night facebook :D gotta get ready to go to the dog show in the morning ! Good luck < PROPFEMALE > ! 
wow . \ 
every time I tried to find out why JB was ruined from a tweet ... \ 
nothing happened . \ 
so ignore all the \OMG ! \ " and \ " The tweet that ruined his career ! \ " stuff . \ 
I always say \the thing I hate most is\ " but today ... \ 
Went to < PROPFEMALE>'s apartment today and I LOVE it ! It's so < PROPFEMALE > , but it has bunches of character and is very comfortable . It's a nice area , and from the sounds of things , someplace that's pretty safe too ! 
Weirdest feeling ever ? \ 
Stumbling across a photo of your own kindergarten class via fb and having the < PROPMALE > to meet the kids again at your high school , but not wanting to say anything because it was kindergarten and they either wouldn't care or don't remember you . 
So , I saw Inception with some friends today ... \ 
BEST . MOVIE . EVER . ( besides httyd , but that was just adorable ! )\ 
No , not because of DiCaprio- I don't go crazy over him like some people . It was just freaking cool ! The plot- completely awesome . Acting- terrific ! Cast choice- amazing ! Soundtrack- < PROPMALE > Zimmern , need I say more ? \ 
All in all , I am in love with this movie now ! 
wooooow . I left my computer on , logged into facebook , for hours ... that's not good . 
\Well I've got the ticket\ 
Bored ... Heading over to < PROPFIRST>'s house later so we can work on that WHAP thing . Soooooooooo not looking forward to it ! Dang procrastination . Not to mention we still have to do the essay part . \ 
Looks like I know what the rest of my summer will be spent doing . D: 
So bored . I've been trying to think of what to sketch for a painting , but I can't come up with anything . Plus , I have to wait for 6:30 to roll around so I can go to the Dive/Swim team meeting . I'm still nervous about dive season , though ! 
How the heck is everyone getting their schedules already ?! I tried logging onto edline , and it said that bloomingdale restricted access . \ 
Not cool ! I'm hating this , cuz I reaaaaaalllllly wanna know what classes I got ! Anyone , feel free to tell me how you find out !

Gimme a shout if we have any periods together ! 
Ahhhh ! I finished my essay ! It's a sucky essay , but I can use the excuse that I haven't taken the class yet if need be :D lol 
OH . MY . GOSH . \ 
I watched ' Saw ' with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > Worley , and it was FREAKY . \ 
I'm a complete chicken when it comes to horror movies , so you can imagine how smart it was for me to agree to watch it late at night ... \ 
* scarred for life*\ 
Thank the lord I have a bajillion lights in my bedroom- I might have to keep one on if the comedy I'm watching won't get the thought of Saw out of my mind . 
First day of school tomorrow ! But oh crap that means more math classes D: * dreading * \ 
Can't wait to see everyone though ! Before we have to go to class everyone should meet in front of the bull ! Of course , there'll be a bajillion other people .... oi . \ 
Question : We go to homeroom before first period , or after ? I can never get that straight ... 
First day at bdale , second year in a row ! What do I do when I get home ? \ 
Sleep . \ 
Yeah , pretty boring day . Got a few friends in a few of my classes , but mostly new people . And I think I'm the only sophomore in my math class . And daaaaaaaaaaaaaanggggg were there a ton of freshies this year ! I hear there were 200 extra or something 
An hour earlier :\ 
\I think I'll sketch for a few minutes ! \ " :D \ 
Mockingjay is out :D \ 
Just saying . \ 
Otherwise , I am sooooooo glad it's the weekend ! 
You know I'm in a strange mood if :\ 
I buy a dress\ 
OR\ 
I buy something from goodwill ( their clothes feel/smell weird :/ )\ 
What did I do today ? I bought a dress from goodwill . 
My cat is just sitting right next to my keyboard , staring at me , without even blinking or looking away ... it's really creepy !!!!! 
OH MY GOSH . I hate this WHAP assignment D: 
Going to the swim meet tonight to cheer on everyone ! Good luck to all the swimmers ! ( And the divers , too , if there's a meet for them as well ! ) 
Tonight I get to draw grass :D fun , I know . And after that , I get to look forward to WHAP homework ... again !!!! And then math ! \ 
Dang this is going to be one long night . D: 
Yeah , you know that WHAP test we have tomorrow ? \ 
Well it looks like I won't be there for it ! Haha ! I can take it on tuesday , then , and study over the weekend ! I guess < PROPFEMALE>'s Dog Shows DO benefit me :) 
Epic fail today ! I signed up for the herpetology club ( aka the playing-with-cute-animals club ) today , and I thought it was a red club .... but I got the club card and it said black . So now I have TWO black clubs D: 
Going to a sweet 16 for my friend < PROPFIRST > today :D gonna have fun ! \ 
Happy 16th birthday < PROPFIRST > !!!! 
omg I hate allergies sooooooo much D: I think I might just die if I don't stop sneezing . \ 
The puppy shower was fun , though :D Congrats for < PROPFEMALE>'s brand new pep-pep , Mizu !!!!! She's so cute :D 
Finished most of the ch5 unit plan :D It was easier than I thought , to tell the truth . Now just to answer the questions D: good thing we have until wednesday ! 
As you might know , I'm applying to be an exchange student . For the application , we have to list 3 families willing to take in an inbound exchange student ( not for the entire year- like , a few weeks ) . This means their English will ( probably ) be poor . Remember , you might not even be picked as a host family . 
No me gusta artista < PROPMALE > bloque D: \ 
Por que no puedo hacer la pintura ?! \ 
No me gusta . 
BEST FEELING EVER : Seeing your chem honors grade of just-barely-passing ( sixty D: ) turn into an 82 overnight :D 
Everyone psyched about the weekend ?! I know I am ! I get to .... \ 
oh wait , I have homework this weekend . Never mind D: \ 
moral of this story : homework ruins social lives 
Was listening to music while doing WHAP homework just now , and guess what song came on ? \ 
\Hips don't lie\ " \ 
Working on my english project right now . Just finished making a comic for it about something that happened last week in the cafeteria before first period . Gotta love friendship ! \ 
\Do i stand like a man ? \ " \ 
Help me D: my project is almost done , but it's due tomorrow ! and I reaaaaaaaaaalllllly don't want it to break on the way to school D: 
Hoping I'll pass both of my AP tests tomorrow . Why must they be on the same day ? D: \ 
On the brighter side ... < PROPFEMALE > stopped bugging me about wanting to sleep on my keyboard ! 
So guys , I really need to get more host fams for my RYE forms if I am going to go on the exchange- I can't go on the exchange without three of them ! The h.f. would have to be willing to take in a foreign exchange student . They would NOT be expected to pay for any costs for the student . Even if they agree to do this and sign the form , they might not even get picked to do it . ( cont . in comment below ) 
Just got my hair cut ! \ 
IT'S SO FLUFFY I'M GONNA DIE ! \ 
but really , the back of my hair is fluffy , and I looooove it <3 so much fun to pet 
Night all ! Gotta go back to school tomorrow D: not gonna be fun , now that spirit week is done ! 
To Monsignor Scully :\ 
We all love you and are sad at your death ! Have a good time in heaven , and say hi to the Big Man for me ! \ 
Love , \ 
< PROPFEMALE > 
Mkay .... so who wants to play \I'll Admit\ " ? :) " 
Well , the halloween party yesterday was really fun ! I met some great people :D \ 
Get to go on a walk in Nature's Way today with my friends , and then I have another party ! \ 
And I still have to finish my chemistry homework . Thanks , < PROPFIRST > , for making me freak out about the pages :P 
OMG I hate Chemistry D: this stuff makes NO SENSE whatsoever ! 
For Ms. < PROPMALE>'s English class , we have to choose an Outside Reading Project Biography or Autobiography . My history with reading nonfiction novels has been ... dreadful at best . Luckily , my mom took me to the mall with her , I < PROPMALE > out at BAM , and whaddya know ? I find an interesting autobiography ! \ 
Two-thirds of the way done with \I'm With Fatty\ " XD " 
Whap HW : incomplete\ 
Whap EC Q's: incomplete\ 
Conclusion : Procrastination SUCKS 
Why is it that when you are so close to finishing homework , you always tend to procrastinate more ? And by you , I mean me D: 
Standing at the stove , watching the pan as some potatoes , peppers , onions , and chicken simmer <3 mmmmm dinner smells good ! 
EPIC FAIL : I'm walking through my room when I make a mental note to step over the trundle ( bed that rolls out from under mine ) since it is pulled out . I am so distracted by making this mental note that I trip over the trundle and almost fall flat on my face D: 
Track , or no track ? That is the question :D \ 
So I'm < PROPMALE > up on whether I should give track a shot and go to conditioning once it starts , or not to . I'm such a horrible runner , it would be hard , but it would certainly help me . Thoughts , anyone ? 
Urrrrrg . No me gusta mi < PROPFEMALE > ahora ! D:< I lost the reference collage for my painting , I got a zero on my progress report for < PROPMALE > because I didn't have the pic ( even though I had the painting ! ) , I'm in an all freshman math class and they're annoying the HELL outta me , I have a load of homework , a million projects , my hair won't behave for me ): and I'm officially ready to just fail chemistry period !!!! \ 
/end rant :[ 
So it turns out I got a call from Rotary Youth Exchange over the weekend- we just found the message . I have to call them tomorrow , but with luck and if I ask , they might let me extend my time for my application ! I shouldn't get my hopes up , but I want this < PROPMALE > sooooo badly <3 \ 
I STILL need host families though . Ask around if you can !!!! Please ? > < 
I officially lost my collage for < PROPMALE > D: I can't paint that fricken cathedral without it ! I'd google it , except for the fact that I have no idea which cathedral it is and only know it MIGHT be somewhere in the UK from some dude's license plate that had been in front of it . \ 
I'm screwed D: 
So I was just chilling here with my laptop , reading my wall , when my cat comes up next to me and starts licking my neck . Is it just me , or is my cat messed up ? 
Pretty sure I passed out for the past six hours- no joke . I decided to lay down for a second on my bed around five before I started my whap homework . I open my eyes , and whaddya know ? It's 10:35 ! At least I'm wide awake for my homework now :) 
I got some tagboard from Miss Speedy , so I get to start my project from scratch ! Dang I am so glad she's going to let me redo it after I lost the picture :D 
It's official ! Dad and I are gonna go see HP on Wednesday ! I can't wait <3 
Saw < PROPMALE > Potter 7 earlier !!!!!!! It was AMAZING ! Closer to the book than most of the other movies , too , although they left out one of the best quotes of all time : \ 
\Hagrid- accio Hagrid !!!! \ " \ 
I need a life D: who the heck gets up at 2:30 in the morning because they remembered they had WHAP homework and didn't want to spend the whole day doing it ? \ 
Obviously , I do . 
\Dude- your mouth is huge ! How many tennis balls can you fit in there ? \ " \ 
OMG fhfdshskhkjhdkfjg\ 
just scrubbed the underside of the sink . it was loaded with black mold . I had to hold my breath D: it was gross . Then , I threw away the gloves I'd been wearing ... but not before my grammy looked in them and noted that one had black mold all over the inside . \ 
if there is two things I hate most in the world , it's cockroaches and mold DX\ 
I'm going to be scrubbing my hands all night long . 
HA ! TAKE THAT , SHEEHAN !!!!! \ 
I finished my WHAP hw BEFORE midnight , so I really will have finished it before monday !!! Nothing like good old procrastination to give you a challenge :D and a headache :/ 
Bleh . Noses are the bane of mankind . \ 
curse you , cold weather ! 
I SWEAR I saw Charice- the singer and the actress of the < PROPFEMALE > Filipino girl on glee- at the mall today ! I did a double-take , and she stared back at me , so I got a good long look . It was DEFINITELY her :D \ 
Sorry , I just thought it was really neat ! And she is < PROPFEMALE > ! I felt tall ! 
Well , I had a good day selling trees and pointsettas at St. < PROPFIRST>'s ( from 9 am to 3 pm D: ) . My feet still hurt from dancing on the street curb like an idiot , trying to get people to honk , shouting in joy when they did , and jumping up and down with my sign :D . All in all , it was fun , and I get to do it all again tomorrow ! 
Just watched Gran Torino again . Such a sad movie D: \ 
GT = best movie ever x3 ! 
So I have been doing homework for hours straight since I got back from crew earlier today at noon . I'll survive , though , because my mom made me my favorite cookies just now , along with a glass of cold milk !!!!! I love her so much :D 
Couldn't go to school today at the risk of puking D: my stomach has been icky all day , but at least I was able to make Struedel for < PROPFEMALE > and myself :) 
I <3 Christmas Time ! We finally put up the tree today , and it looks so pretty !!!! 
\Another head aches 
when I am done with WHAP at the end of the year , I SWEAR I am going to scream for joy at 3:01 :D 
\IWEYRFJSBJVGKSUYDFGHBDSJGDYGYDGJSA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \ " ---- when you can't think of anything else to say because of how frustrated you've become D:< " 
This break , I have officially decided I am going to chill <3 gonna stay home , read , wrap presents , possibly clean my room , and make fun of my cat . \ 
oh- and forget whatever smidgen of chemistry I might have learned . 
Cat on my lap , cat on my lap , so bored so that's my rap :D \ 
I think I would've made Eminem proud XD\ 
but seriously , it's hard to type with < PROPFEMALE > on my arms D: 
\Are you telling me my soul is a chickpea ?! \ " \ 
I'm months past when I should have done it , but I finally started my permit course stuff ! It's boring D\: " 
< PROPFEMALE > christmas EVERYONE ! Still trying to get used to the touchscreen 
Well , the bananas were going bad , so I'm sitting here with my nook , waiting for the banana bread I'm making to come out of the oven ): um . Text me ? 
Haha ! Signed up for chemistry online for next semester ! So glad that the guidance office accepted my class change <3 
Doing homework , listening to film scores , and trying to ignore a creeping suspicion that I forgot something terribly important D: 
Oyyyy . Not home for even five minutes and ww3 breaks out !!! 
\Somebody told me\ " by the killers <3 one of the most fun songs to sing with :3 " 
GAHAHAHAHA ! I have defeated one of seven exams ; only six to go ! Goodnight everyone , and god luck with tomorrow's exams ! 
I am so ready for exams to be over ... 
muahahahaha ! i figured out how to go online w/ the wii ! 
Well , my mum was surprised by the arrival of our relatives Yesterday ! Too bad old lady dog < PROPFEMALE > isn't here with us . 
Oh Florida Virtual School , how I loathe thee ... why must thou interrupt my night of a dearth of homework ? 
Muahahahaha ! I have defeated the beast known as FLVS . Now I don't feel guilty for not doing chemistry all week <3 
I just had an epiphany ! \ 
I finally figured out how to find the number of moles in an element <3 dang , this feels weird . Now if only I'd known that LAST semester\ 
Thank you , Google . 
Nevermind about the epiphany google gave me earlier . I'm back at square zero ... \ 
WHY must chemistry be so damn confusing ?!?!?!?!?! 
crudddddddddddddddddddddddddddd\ 
I completely forgot about the Ch 20 unit plan until today ... \ 
and I have absolutely NONE of it finished . \ 
Who thinks I can stay sane long enough to finish it ? 
Well , I finished almost all of my unit plan , and I'm still mostly sane > D I'll just finish the rest at lunch tomorrow ! Night Facebook :D 
\Everybody dance now ! -duh duh duh duh- Everybody dance now ! Give me the music 
Finished more of my virtual schooling , not that any of you guys care . Just thought I'd share my relief :3 
So google has this thing where you can take a virtual tour of < PROPMALE > museums around the globe , and I tried it out . There weren't a ton of museums to choose , from , but plenty of the < PROPMALE > ones were there ! It was amazing ! 
Stayed home from school today . I spent the entire time doing yardwork D: I want to thank everyone who prayed for my uncle < PROPMALE > as he passed away on the lanai last night . He went in his sleep , and even though both the prayers and the cpr could not keep him with us , he is in a better place . RIP < PROPMALE > 
Bathed my cat earlier D: she wasn't very happy with me afterwards , but I guess she got over it . She's sitting on my lap right now , staring at the screen :D 
is ignoring the sound of the Superbowl in the living room as I dread going back to school tomorrow . 
\It's like fish ... but SQUARED ! \ " - < PROPFEMALE > 
Be honest :\ 
who , besides me , didn't know that Taio < PROPFIRST > is British ???? \ 
Because I just found that out via pandora O: 
Sheehan : \How did the peninsulares treat the creoles ? \ " \ 
muahahahahah ! Take that , homework ! You have been slain :D 
Okay , I am UBER confused . \ 
I checked my grades for WHAP with Sheehan just now . He updated it yesterday . I have a frigging 37 ! It says that I have zeros for unit plans 17 - 20 , but we got them back today and they definitely were NOT zeros . soooo .... what the hell is up with this ? 
If anyone says the words ' school ' , ' grades ' , ' GPA ' , ' tests ' , or ' projects ' to me , I am going to hit them . 
You know you're taking WHAP when you're relieved to have a D in the class :D 
Oh , < PROPFEMALE > Kahlo . I love you :D thanks for being so blunt :\ 
\I was born a bitch . I was born a painter . \ " - < PROPFEMALE > Kahlo " 
Off to church ! See you guys later :D 
No me gusta lastimar a mi rodilla D: 
hates when people talk OH SO LOUDLY into their cellphones 
Why is it I only ever get distracted when I have a ton of work to do ? \ 
Nice job , < PROPFEMALE > . Real nice . 
can't believe I spent $55 at borders D: Luckily , I had plenty of giftcards . It's all worth it though , because I am now the proud owner of \The Heroes\ " . \ 
Muahahahahaha ! I finished my online chemistry lab <3 
Doing whap homework ... these notes take FOR-EV-ER . no me gusta D: 
Been coughing all day D: blech .... 
One day , I WILL live in a hobbit hole ! I swear this !!!! :D got bored from my homework and looking up how-to's for building one 
-is going to kill herself over the WHAP unit plan questions 
XD I was doing question 3 in whap just now , and instead of writing :\ 
\The American Revolution BEGAN because of\ " \ 
is sick of being sick D: 
Off to do whap and english ! :) 
Finished some Whap and some English , but I realllllllly don't want to do any more . \ 
I don't know about the rest of you guys , but I am SO ready for summer ! 
Not looking forward to all of the makeup homework I have , but I sure as heck wasn't gonna go to school sooner and get everyone else sick with the creeping crud . On the bright side , it means I'll only have gone to school one day this week :D 
I'm crazy lucky <3 been absent for almost the whole week from school , and I don't have much make-up work ! 
If everyone jumped off of a bridge , the only reason I'd jump too is so that no one could accuse me of pushing them ! 
Oy ... sore from moving furniture and junk literally ALL day DX I got a new bedroom , though , so I can't wait to get it all finished ! <3 
< PROPMALE > Jethro Gibbs = definitely someone worthy of being picked for the Whap Project :D 
has 13 days to :\ 
-finish and present one current event\ 
-bring up her 56 in AP psych to at least a C\ 
-bring up her 64 in AP world history to a C\ 
-make up a < PROPMALE > Caesar test\ 
-hopefully get a good grade in Math\ 
D: not looking forward to the next thirteen days 
God , I know you have a sense of humor , but it's starting to piss me off , all of this school crap ! D:< I swear , at this rate I'm definitely not going to be passing any of my classes . \ 
Off to bed :/ 
Well , at least I found my study guides :) \ 
now if only I could magically make my grades disappear ! 
Hahaha ! I finished my homework ! Take that , schoolwork ! :D 
is not looking forward to the unit plan she put off D: 
Screw you , unit plan ! \ 
an hour later and I only have the vocab and the timelines done |:< 
Finished most of my hw . all I have left is my whap review ... D:< I'm really hating those things . 
Ugh . Sooooo no looking forward to typing up my english essay or doing my whap review . \ 
why is it all I ever write about is my homework ? I seriously need to get a life D: 
So let me get this straight , < PROPFEMALE > Grammer can end a 15 yr marriage by phone , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > can be on divorce #9 , < PROPFEMALE > Spears had a 55 hour marriage , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > and Tiger Woods , while married , were having sex with EVERYONE , 53% of Americans get divorced and 30-60% cheat on their spouses . Yet , same-sex marriage is going to destroy the institution of marriage ? Really ? Re-post if you find this ironic . 
Procrastination = fml . ORP and Unit Plan = ... yeah :/ 
Homework is never so bad when listening to stuff like \All Summer Long\ " :) Such a happy tune <3 " 
\ Ms. Perky : So 
Took the dog on a long walk <3 
WHAP in one word ? \ 
... blech . 
Soooo .... lent ... \ 
What to give up or take on ? \ 
I so should have thought of this earlier DX 
Listening to the best band in the world <3 , sitting in my living room with a husky on my feet , and doing my ORP . If it weren't for that last thing , this would be perfect :) 
ALMOST DONE ! Only this last question on my ORP , and then I get to finish the WHAP unit plan . \ 
ugh .... 
Happy Birthday < PROPMALE > Norris ! \ 
And haha ! I finally finished my ORP ! 
Just got done sauteeing some apples and bananas with cinnamon <3 fueron muy deliciosos 
Watched all three Lord of the Rings with my Auntie Bitty all day :D it was so much fun <3 
Had the best dinner in the world tonight <3 my all-time favorite thing : stuffed shells :D 
Went on a walk and saw a bunch of bats :D they were so cute <3 
Went to the beach yesterday ! I had such a great time , but my chest got sunburned . And one of my ankles , strangely enough , even though I put on sunscreen . Ouch D: 
Was going to make pancakes for lunch , but I ended up making popovers with sauteed apples and an orange sauce <3 it was absolutely delicious , if I may say so myself ! 
ugh . Kill me . I just realized that we have a unit plan due the day we get back for WHAP . AND I still have a ton of reviews to make up D: \ 
so much for the rest of the weekend 
been baking all day . I swear , if this cheescake cracks ... D:< only 20 minutes to go ! 
The cheesecake cracked ):

Got the animals vaccinated today and watched movies :) All in all , it was a good saturday <3 
Saw Sucker Punch earlier with < PROPFIRST > Coss and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > today ! It was soooo good :D kinda confusing in some parts , but still good ! 
So much for WHAP . I TOTALLY forgot we had a unit plan due tomorrow until about an hour ago , and I only have the vocab and the timelines done . DX I am so screwed . 
Hahaha ! Take that , Whap ! I got an 82 for my final grade ! No idea how , but I really don't care at this point <3 
Anyone have any idea who the to-be-debated-over are for tomorrow for Sheehan's 8th Period ? i completely forgot and can't tell looking at the bracket :/ 
Gotta love procrastination :/ 
Going to the Jubilee today with the gang :D 
So who else procrastinated on WHAP ? \ 
Lord , help me D: 
I'm sorry , HTTYD , but there's a new favorite movie in town :\ 
Tangled\
