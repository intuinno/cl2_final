is running the Watermelon 5k at 7:30 this morning :) Happy 4th of July ! 
This morning's Watermelon 5k was awesome ! 31.10 was my time ; first mile in 8:40 , second mile in 10:30 , third mile ( mile and a tenth ) in 11:50 . Goal for next race - under 30 minutes . Let me know if anyone wants to join next time . It's always better to have 
just bought a patent attorney . They might call it ' put on retainer ' , but at that price I prefer to say I've made a purchase . Like buying a time share , even though you don't have exclusive rights to the place it just feels better to call it owning . 
I've started craving my runs . It's funny , I was always a jogging dabbler , but lately I'm looking forward to ' my time ' . It's a mental reset button that makes everything seem better .

Second run of week 7 done . I had to start this week over , but it was worth it . 
tried on my ten year old pair of Lucky Jeans , and they're LOOSE . The running apparently comes with certain benefits . 
wants cookies ..... 
Did the first day of Couch to 5k week eight . Much more of a mental challenge than a physical one . I was completely prepared to have to do week seven over again ( again ) . Now , I'm not even tired ! I rock , and so do all of my happy little endorphin friends . 
If you scroll to the bottom of any < PROPFEMALE > to where it says English(UK ) or English(US ) you can also change the language to English(Pirate ) . It is fairly amazing ... everything on FB becomes pirateaze ....

Had a blast at the Baton Rouge Zoo today . 
really wishes she could sleep like a normal person , instead of having another staring contest with the insomnia monster . Even one night a week would be fine at this point . Just one .

The new scale says my ' body age ' is 28 . Go new scale ! Why a 28 year old has two white eyebrow hairs , I have no idea . Maybe it's a new thing for the under 30 set .....

I replaced the upper radiator hose in my car this afternoon , and now feel very accomplished :) $13 for the part is so much better than taking it to a shop . 
I think < PROPFEMALE > Lawless is a better match than the < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > references , or < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > ( which I've never understood ) . Besides , who wouldn't want to be Xena ?

is unusually content . 
Prototyping - I have good news and bad news . For those of you wondering what I'm talking about , I filed a Patent earlier this year for a pet tracking device . I've now found a local engineering firm that will do a 50k job for 10k , with the agreement that I use them for my smart phone app design . 
The good news - 10k is MUCH better than 50k . Their resume's look amazing , and they can have it done in 3-6 months . I can then take the device to stores and get orders . 
The bad news - I have 3k of the 10k . The 15k over the last year on patents , GPS modules and design consultations tapped my personal resources . I am posting this hoping that someone will know a person looking to invest in a start-up company . \ 
\ 
I have fully developed marketing and sales research . If there is anyone out there interested , or a group of people , I'm a registered LLC offering company participation .

I had a WONDERFUL birthday with everyone yesterday ! 
I'm composing a reply to that interested investor . I'm torn between excitement and nausea , settling most often into an uncomfortable state of pleased queasiness . 
SENT ! 
Mmmm , two hour birthday massage = WIN . I just used my awesome birthday rescue knife to open my bottle of birthday Moscato wine . I'm wearing my birthday t-shirt , about to eat one of my birthday cupcakes , listening to my birthday wind chimes and enjoying the smell of Fresh Linen candles that I got for my , that's right , birthday .

So the potential investor emailed me back today and asked how far along we were with the patent filing . Progress , progress ... 
I experienced an Apricot < PROPFEMALE > cupcake from Blue Bird Bake Shop today . It was like touching the face of a heretofore unknown divinity .
