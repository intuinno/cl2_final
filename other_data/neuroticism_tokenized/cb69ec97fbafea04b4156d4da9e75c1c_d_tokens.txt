Nature is utterly indifferent to your presence . 
im wanted =) muhahaha 
got snakes at my heels ! 
It is not enough to have a dream unless I am willing to pursue it . It is not enough to know what is right unless I amstrong enough to do it . It is not enough to join the crowd , to be acknowledged and accepted , I must be true to my ideals , even if am left out and rejected . It is not enough to learn the truth unless I also learn to live it . It is not enough to reach for love unless I care enough to give it . 
whoooooooo !!!! i feel so freee !!! suckers ! tonight should be interesting ! dumdumdummmmm

today sucked . i cant wait till tomorrow so i can start over 
super self-exploratory meditation . 
super self-exploratory meditation : We do not grow absolutely , chronologically . We grow sometimes in one dimension , and not in another ; unevenly . We grow partially . We are relative . We are mature in one realm , childish in another . The past , present , and future mingle and pulls us ...! 
i went on an adventure tonight , saved my bestie from car breaking down in the ghetto . got free food , jacked a uhaul ... not really lol . im pooped , going to bed finally . i love you < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > !

$ 32,000 for online classes ???! motha trucka u must be out < PROPFEMALE > mind ! i'll stick to my original plan 
i bumb my music at 2am . so . 
every person is like a puzzle piece in a big ass puzzle set . and even though its hard as hell and might take forever there is always that piece somewhere in the box that fits perfectly with you . there are some pieces that LOOK like they fit and you try but it always falls out if it really doesnt . the right puzzle piece never falls off , and remember its somewherein that box ... you just have to look for it . 
if i wrote a book , would you read it ? do share . 
i just got another crazy idea . NEW ZEALAND 
u think you can works things out , and promises are made to change , and exchanges of affection are made , say that you'll never fight or shout.it never happens . thats just our way of prolonging a relationship in hopes that some nonexistant moment happens that fixes everything . 
have not been up this early in a whil . and for some reason i feel better than when i sleep in ... strange . 
gonna be lame today and watch lord of the rings , than go to richland than give blood . make me feel better about myself =) 
a friend told me something that hit home and has stuck so deeply in my head that i really feel this might be a turning point in my life : how can i complain and be angry and protest the attrocities of this world when i do NOTHING to change myself ? it starts with us ... 
got my tuition monayyy whoohooooo !! 
got an an interview scheduled now its time to kick back and watch some < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > muhahaha

* We as ppl must live out lives that are civilized , but in the confines of our minds we are not civilized , not even close . when we close our eyes , we take imagination vacations to live out fantasies that in reality would be considered taboo or crazy . our actions may be limited , thus imprisoning us , but we must allow our minds to wander so we may be free

Eventually the current world situation will resolve into a more stable world and a greater unity among nations .

Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate . Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure . We ask ourselves , Who am I to be brilliant , gorgeous , talented , fabulous ? Actually , who are you not to be ? We were born to make manifest the < PROPFEMALE > of God that is within us . And as we let our own light shine , we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same

Soon the child's clear eye is clouded over by ideas and opinions , preconceptions and abstractions . Simple free being becomes encrusted with the burdensome armor of the ego . Not until years later does an instinct come that a vital sense of mystery has been withdrawn . The heart is pierced in a moment of beauty and strange pain , like a memory of paradise . After that day , we become seekers . 
I am here for a purpose and that purpose is to grow into a mountain , not to shrink to a grain of sand . Henceforth will I apply all my efforts to become the highest mountain of all and I will strain my potential until it cries for mercy .

What makes a man question his reality more than another man ? Both may have undergone the same amount of suffering , hardship , and loss . Yet one questions the fabric of his nature and the order of things , and another blindly submits and accepts the reality which is presented to him . 
He who hesitates is at loss . 
Normal is getting dressed in clothes that you buy for work and driving through traffic in a car that you are still paying for – in order to get to the job you need to pay for the clothes and the car , and the house you leave vacant all day so you can afford to live in it . \

Life is a stage , and we are all but actors unfolding a story of great drama , the story of humanity . we all are wearing our masks and costumes to play our rolls in the story ; alas the time has come , the play is almost over and the curtain is falling . but some of us have forgotten we were actors in a play , the play is over . take off your mask , so you may discover the true beauty behind it .
