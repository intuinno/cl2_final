took the time to cook a legitimate meal of asparagus and cheese ravioli with some spinach and yummy pasta sauce on an actual oven while listening to that Italian song that plays in those pasta commercials on Youtube only to drop the bowl face down on the stove and watch everything splat in a 360 degree projectile slow motion effect . :( 
can't think of a status that can accurately express how much I've come to love the UCD Kendo club and everyone in it . Every practice , late-night DC dinner , shinai workshop and weekend with you guys have been the events that I'm always looking forward to , with the people i'm always happiest to be around . You guys are the best :) <3 Seniors , don't go !!!!!
