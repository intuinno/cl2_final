Life is too short to keep holding onto the people that don't matter . :3 Just because you've been in my life for this long , doesn't mean you have to stay in my life . Other than that tonight { and the people I < PROPMALE > out with tonight } are ALL amazing . :3

Woke up from an awful nightmare . I really just need to talk to < PROPFIRST > but 1 ) I have no voice and 2 ) I don't know where he is . 
< PROPMALE > save me , they try to tell me how to feel . This love is difficult , but it's real . Don't be afraid , we'll make it out of this mess . It's a love story baby just say yes ~ <3 <3 <3

Five people today have called me by ' Trouble ' . Great , I got a new nickname . xD 
needs to find something to take her mind off the situation at hand . <3 Because if she doesn't she's gonna explode or something is gonna end up broken . <3 
Fuck this . 
I heard the reverberating footsteps Synching up to the beating of my heart , And I was positive that unless I got myself together , I would watch me fall apart . And I can't let that happen again ' cause then you'll see my heart In the saddest state it's ever been . This is no place to try and live my life . 
has a feeling that this really isn't going to end well . 
Why is it that everyone gets it but the one person that I need to ?! 
Hey girl Where's your drink ? We goin’ all get real drunk tonight Hey girl I got < PROPMALE > we can all get fucked up tonight ( get fucked up tonight ) By the end of the night Imma have you drunk and throwing up ( hey ! ) By the end of the night Imma have you so fucked up !

is getting ready for her job interview . Hopefully I'll get to talk to < PROPFIRST > before hand . =/ 
Great . < PROPFIRST > is here and sleeping over . =/ ( Not Fright Nights < PROPFIRST > ) 
is trying to figure out what she's going to wear tonight . XD

Homework time . Then class tonight . Rawr . xD 
God fucking damnit . My arm hurts . > < My fault , but still . 
Hold me , whatever lies beyond this morning is a little later on . Regardless of warnings the future doesn't scare me at all . 
is already set to leave class . ( Mind you it doesn't start for another 6 minutes ) 
I gets to see him . <3 
Is still sore from the crash , but feeling a lot better , that , and waking up and having a job = nice . XD 
Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile . The precious moments are all lost in the tide , yea . They're swept away and nothing is what is seems . The feeling of belonging to your dreams . 
I do believe that it is now Game Over . All that's left is to wait . 
So , apparently me getting into a car accident is all my fault . At least according to my mom it is . Oh , and I'm not allowed to drive my car anywhere , and nobody is allowed to pick me up . If anyone wants to see me , then they have to come here . Because it's my fault for getting in the accident . 
Demo , < PROPFEMALE > de yo ? Douyatte beshi watashi sawari ? Aishiteru , koinu . < PROPFEMALE > wa ookami to waga sugoi karashi .... to waga sugoi nushi . {{ XDD Kudos + cookies if you know who it's about and you figure out what it says . }}

I can't get comfy , this bed is too big to lay in alone . And I just wanna talk to him because hearing his voice just puts me at peace . <3 
can't sleep . At all . Something is wrong , I just don't know what yet . 
When things go wrong I pretend the past isn't real . Now I'm trapped in this memory And I'm left in the wake of the mistake , slow to react . Even though you're close to me , You're still so distant , and I can't bring you back .

Just when I think things are starting to go right ... Obviously , I was wrong . 
Dreaming comes so easily , ' Cause it's all that I've known . True love is a < PROPFEMALE > tale . I'm damaged , So how would I know ? I'm scared and I am alone . I am ashamed , And I need for you to know ... I didn't say all the things that I wanted to say , and you can't take back what you have taken away . Cause I feel you ... I feel you , near me 
Open fire on my burning heart . I've never been lucky in love . My defenses are down , a kiss or a frown . I can't survive on my own . If a guy walks in and carves her name in my heart , I'll turn and run away . Everyday we've all been led astray . It's hard to be lucky in love . 
can't wait until her and < PROPFIRST > leave . <3 
almost just died ... again . Lmfao . xD Ahhh , I got skill . lmfao . 
is sitting in the school library trying to get some homework done before class . And I so quit my job today . xD

is now accepting cosplay commissions ! =D FTW ! 
seriously needs money for school . DX I need to make a payment or get kicked out RIGHT before I graduate . ;-; 
feels like her life is just going straight to hell . 
I'm in serious shit , I feel totally lost . If I'm asking for help it's only because being with you has opened my eyes . Could I ever believe such a perfect surprise ? I keep asking myself , wondering how . I keep closing my eyes but I can't block you out . Wanna fly to a place where it's just you and me . Nobody else so we can be free . 
ahahahahahaha 
has an awful headache and the feeling that something bad is going to happen . >.< 
feels like she's gonna throw up . > < I hate the feeling of being sick . I'm coughing and have a sore throat and just grr . 
loves her < PROPFIRST > . <3 Very very much . 
just gave 2,248 milligrams of < PROPMALE > bear stuffing to help end Child Abuse . ( http://apps.new.facebook.com/lunchmoney/?ref=st ) -- Play free games to Save the Planet ! 
has been up all night and is working on making a costume while < PROPFIRST > Pfundheller is sleeping . he's so koot . <3 
wants a freaking doughnut ! > < 
doesn't wanna get off the computer . But dos wanna beat the person that didn't tell me that < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > called me . =_________________= 
just made a donation on Save the Planet ! http://apps.new.facebook.com/lunchmoney/?ref=st - Match her donation by playing free games ! 
thinks shes going to go and take a nap . <3 
is sitting outside with her laptop because she couldn't sleep . Ugg . =/ I wish I could just cuddle and then be able to fall asleep but nooo of course I can't . =.=; 
kjfhyfs . -headdesk- 
is rockin ' out to Simple Plan feeling seriously dorkish ... but lovin ' every second of it . XD 
has decided that its time for a lot of changes to happen in her life . :3 
is actually wearing makeup and doesn't look too bad . xD I should get some pictures . ;3 
If\ 
you're just sitting there waiting for me to fail , then baby , you're \ 
just going to be disappointed . ;3 
I know I can be annoying , and a bit insecure . But regardless of everything I'm so unsure of , I know there is one thing I can hold on to and never second guess . And thats the fact that I love you . <3 
My < PROPFEMALE>'s in teh Hospital . =/ So keep her in your prayers please ? 
loves < PROPFEMALE > Karimi very , very much . xD 
doesn't know why people are just assuming that I'm not living at < PROPFIRST>'s anymore and that we broke up . I'm still living there and I'm still dating him . 
is way too amused . Texts From Last Night is a good way to pass the time . xD 
isn't sure weather that was epic or fail . xD lmfaooooo 
Well , today just royally sucks . 
is freaking hungrrryyyyy . <3 And < PROPFIRST > needs a cookie , yes he does . XD 
knows that everything will be okay . <3 You just gotta believe it . :3 
is actually back home now . xD Like , home-home . :3 
Just\ 
for fun : POKE me , if you've ever had a crush on me . LIKE this status\ 
if you think I'm cute . INBOX me if you ever wanted a relationship \ 
with me . Now let's see who's brave enough to copy and paste this on \ 
their status . 
already doesn't want to be living here . I want my own place just for < PROPFIRST > and I . 
Motor imagery , I has it . So basically I've been diagnosed and I'm either retarded , insane or close to a photographic memory . I'm honestly not sure how to feel . 
' s wisdom teeth are coming in and it hurts like all hell . =/ And I couldn't sleep well last night because I had noone to cuddle with ! 
I never should have come home . My mom has her head shoved so far up her ass that it's ridiculous . If I say the sky's blue then she'll tell me it's actually turquoise just to prove me wrong . I'm a fucking idiot for thinking it would be good for me to come back home 
thinks that < PROPFIRST > Pfundheller should be here to cuddle with me as we watch Sweeny < PROPMALE > . -nodnodnod- 
is going to bed , I guess . I stayed up for as long as I did for a reason . But you know , I guess I should learn that when people promise that they'll call ... they don't . 
RAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWR 
is getting ready to do some heavy , heavy highlights in her hair . :3 
Rawr for the one bottle not working ! Does anybody have an extra bottle of bleach they're willing to give me ? xD

Happy 19th Birthday to me ~ 
Just got home from being with my < PROPFIRST > . <3 And now it's time to celebrate my birthday with my family . =D 
Hearing the phrase ' I Love You . ' will never get old . <3 
has been up all\ 
night cleaning ( what was my room , I was working on getting everything\ 
out so I can have a bed thats NOT in the living room ) and my Mom woke\ 
up and has been yelling and screaming at me about < PROPFIRST > and about\ 
everything in my life . I don't wanna live here , I don't wanna be here . Fuck everything . 
I just spent the last 10 hours cleaning , but I finally have a bedroom ! Bed , Posters , Desk and all . :3 
is going to bed . Nighty night and sweet dreams , everybody ! Er .. or .. have a good day ? xD Feel free to call the house and wake my ass up . :P Esp . If your name is < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > or < PROPFEMALE > . xD ( In that order xDD )

So just ran around the house being ninja looking for a house phone so I could talk to < PROPFIRST > . xD 
R.I.P. to Crunch Bear , the dog I've had since I was 4 years old . I love you and know you and your sister Symphy are in a better place now . 
I just re-realized how I fell for you so hard way back when , because I'm doing it over again . <3

Someone should call me and keep me amused . :3 
When you hold me in your arms you make me feel so safe . Everyone told me to walk away , but don't you see why I stayed ? -- Dream Girl by Basshunter ftw ! 
has a sore throat and is getting sick . =/ All I want is to do is have a < PROPFIRST > to cuddle with as I watch Advent Children . Then I would be perfectly happy . 
AHAHAHAHAH ! I love Kelido < PROPFEMALE > . XD ??? 
' cause everytime I think of her the phrase ' Jump , bitch ! Jump!' just rings in my head . Then again , she wouldn't have to jump , just get close enough to the edge for a Spartan kick while < PROPFEMALE > Cloutier records it all . lmfao . Ahhh , I'm going to hell . <3 
Can't wait for Friday . <3 
is taking a shower , then getting back to cleaning . If you got the house number , feel free to call and keep me entertained , please . :P

Fall in love or fall in hate . Get inspired or be depressed . Ace a test or flunk a class . Make babies or make < PROPMALE > . Speak the truth or lie and cheat . Dance on tables or sit in the corner . Life is divine chaos . Embrace it . Forgive yourself . Breathe and enjoy the ride .

has a headache from hell . >.< Somebody makes it better , please ? 
If you want to get in touch with me , then call MY fucking phone . Unless there is really a valid reason , there is no reason for you to talk to my family for me , without my permission or pretending to be me while you fucking talk to them . I don't need you to control who I talk to , nor what I do . I'm a big girl , I can make my own fucking decisions . So instead of running to my parents and talking to them , talk to me . 
Is bored . </3 Anybody wanna do something today ? =D 
is going out ~ ! Yay ! =D 
shower and then bed . Had an awesome day with one of the most amazing people ever . <3 I'm going to beat the hell out of < PROPMALE > before the day is over though ( Who , by the way , isn't the amazing person ) . =.=; So hopefully < PROPFIRST > Pfundheller and I will get to see each other sometime this weekend/early week . :3 Nighty night , sweet dreams and I love you . <3

And boo for Sin killing me ... again . =___________= That bitch .

Just when I thought no one cared , You're the answer to my prayer . You lift my spirits high . Come on and rescue me ~ ! -- Toca's Miracle -- Fragma 
Doesn't know if she should attempt to call again . xD 
so how manly does it make you feel to make a girl cry ? I mean , really . 
You know what ? I'm not even gonna let it get to me . :3 The fact that you gotta sit there and talk shit about to to everybody else ( yet not say a damn word to me about it ) proves that you're just a jealous bitch . I was going to defend you , but obviously there is no reason for me to ~ 
I love < PROPFIRST > Pfundheller more than anything . <3 -nuzzles-\ 
And Thank God for the 4th of July . xD Amazing people , explosives and alcohol . Fuck . yes .

Of course , its as soon as < PROPFIRST > gets a place to stay , I'm going to get kicked out of mine . I get to start packing all my stuff . I'm no longer even allowed to speak here . If I do , i'm going to get kicked out . Heaven forbid I leave my room . Which isn't even mine . I have no clue what I'm going to do . 
Boo for anxiety caused insomnia and chest pains . =/ 
God , I miss him so much it makes me want to cry . Between everything going on I don't know what I'm going to do . I just want him with me and I wanna know that everything is going to be okay .

I'm sorry master , I swear I won't touch ' your ' phone ever again . I'm sorry people that know me try to get in touch with me through your house line , like you told them to . Terribly sorry that I live in your home and take up space . Don't worry , I'll be gone soon enough and then you won't have to worry about me taking up space or hearing my voice through your phone . 
Soooo I wait around for about four hours waiting for a person to call back ... after I call they call me back and inform me that they're leaving for the night and I'm not talking to them . \ 
\ 
Nice way to spend my night . 
Obviously I'm not that important . So , being as my plans were all cancelled for tomorrow ( even though I got a ride and all(Yes , I am that pissed . )) , anybody wanna do anything tomorrow morning ? 
Soooo shouldn't have done that . = X Eh-oh ... Oh well . XD Still upset but it happens . Gonna try this ' sleep ' thing and try to get my 2 hours in .

Gonna re-dye my hair . xD Blonde , Red , Brunette or Black ? :3 Or suggestions . <3 
My leeeeeeeg . It wont stop bleeeeeeding . > < 
thinks that people need to make up their minds . You're either single , or you're in a fucking relationship . And to be in said relationship both sides need to agree . Come on people , you can do it ! 
So thus far , today has been a total fail . 
Ahhh ... drama , drama and more drama . Make it stooooop . 
I ... think I'm single ? 
I just can't do this anymore . Its either you want me or you don't . So make up your mind because I can't handle my emotions being played on like this anymore . 
Thinks that she knows what she's going to do . 
I FOUND ANOTHER ONE ! BUWAHAHA ! <3 -hugs and dances- xD And here I thought they all got thrown out !

Oh half of my heart's got a grip on the situation . Half of my heart takes time . Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you that I can't keep loving you . Oh , with half of my heart . -- Half of my Heart by < PROPFIRST > Mayer -sways- Buwah . xD 
You know , you would think that after 19 years my Mom would know I don't like the taste of eggs . xD Yet everytime she makes it and I tell her I don't like them , I get the same look . 
is really happy , even though she's sick . Mom just said she'd take me to go see < PROPFIRST > on Saturday , even though that means I'm giving up Warped Tour . But you know what ? It's more than worth it . <3 
Very happy birthday to < PROPFEMALE > Cloutier ! Going out with her , < PROPFEMALE > Blodgett and < PROPFIRST > Pfundheller to celebrate . :3 
Had an awesome night . So happy that I got to see < PROPFIRST > tonight . <3 Like you have no idea . 
Is in a very happy mood ! =D I don't know what it is , maybe because I got to see some friends I rarely ever get to see , but at the moment I'm really happy and just love my life . XD 
He won’t ever get enough . Once he gets a little touch . If I had it my way , you know that I’d make him say Ooooooh Ooooooh . -- I swear to God , Taco < PROPFEMALE > must have put crack in my food . I'm so hyper . 
Is really pissed . My friend calls 20 minutes before I get up because she was going to come pick me up . ' cause her , < PROPFIRST > , myself and some other people were supposed to < PROPFEMALE > and my mom tells her not to bother and doesn't even bother telling me 
is now really frustrated . -_________-; Ima throw a chair at somebody . 
So if somebody has a car and is willing to do me a favor for like $20 , I'll love you forever . <3 It just needs to be ASAP . 
wants to cry . ;-; Bleh , I hate being here . 
WOOOO ! < PROPFIRST > time . <3 Day just instantly got better . xD 
Had an amazing weekend with < PROPFIRST > Pfundheller and others . <3 God , I love him so much .

You think you know me ? What's my Full name , Nickname , Birthday , Bestfriend , Favorite color , favorite food & First love . Post this as your status and see who knows you . 
Okay , I don't care how we do it but I've got to get us the hell out of here .

don't deserve me at my best . If you're a HANDFUL then post this on your status . 
is on the phone with < PROPFIRST > Pfundheller ~ . Got to see Kodi Katastrophic and < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Maslow earlier , who were both looking sexy as ever . xD 
Getting ready for bed . :P Gonna talk to < PROPFIRST > first though . 
is going out for a bit . Yaaay . -passes back out- 
Well , today was scary as hell . I actually fainted earlier today and had to be picked up and put into the ac and everything else . =/ 
\I thought you said you couldn't eat lately . ' ' I couldn't but now I'm suddenly eating everything like a stoner . ' XD " 
still isn't feeling good . So ima just lay in my bed with my blanky , < PROPFEMALE > and Pandi and watch Vampires Suck . <3 
\I've never fooled anyone . I've let people fool themselves . They didn't bother to find out who and what I was . Instead they would invent a character for me . I wouldn't argue with them . They were obviously loving somebody I wasn't . \"" 
Can't sleep . >_<; 
just got home from a 6 am doughnut run with her older sister . Ahhh , that was fun/funny . xD 
Finally feel tired enough to sleep , hopefully . :P Nighty night everybody , call me if somethin ' is goin ' on xD 
Just woke up a bit ago . Maybe going out in a bit ? =D 
Just got a phone call saying ' You have 10 minutes to get dressed before I show up at your door . ' xD 
is finally done crying . Why should I bother crying over people when they wouldn't do the same thing for me ? :3 Not going to worry about it , I'm just going to live my life . I have some * amazing * friends , that I'm so thankful for . That I know will be here for me . So I don't need anybody else , right ? 
Best way to avoid answering a question , but still make them feel like they got the answer ? Answer them with a neutral reply and quickly ask another question . <3 
is going to bed happy . <3 Yay for people dedicating songs to me . xD 
is still hoping that plans are on to go out tonight 
is highly amused . Goin ' out , should be home later . :3 If now , I'll have my sisters cell phone . 
really wants to cry right now . xD 
If there is one thing about me that you love , what would it be ? Tell me and I'll do the same thing for you . 
is going to attempt to get some sleep . Yeeeah , lets see how that works for me . xD 
Just two more days until Chibi-Pa ! 
Going out for a little bit . :3 
Had fun , even though we didn't do much . :3 I love my friends . Then I got to come home to pizza ! XD 
Do all you can to make people happy because you never know how much you can positively impact someone just by doing the smallest things . <3 
All I want for this weekend is < PROPFIRST > Pfundheller ... and possibly Chibi Pa : GO !!!!!. And no more drama . 
' I know it might seem frightening , to have the world fall apart right under your shoes . Trust me , you'll make it through . ' 
is hungry but there is seriously no food in the house . ;-; 
Finally finished making dinner for the family . Only had one dish break , explode and go all over the place . xD 
Ahh , sleepy sleepy . ~.~ 
suddenly is awake . xD So Alivia and I are working on our costumes ! =D Sexy Pikachu cosplay , here I come . <3 
Ahhh , I should learn not to get my hopes up . XD I had so many good plans for this weekend and ... yeah . They all died within a 24 hour period . fml . 
is beyond excited ! =D Yay ! I'm going to Chibi Pa : GO !!!!! with < PROPFEMALE > Scherette because she is truly that amazing . xD 
Anybody got a couple extre dollars and lives in lake worth ? 
is finally home after an amazing/very eventful weekend at Chibi-pa with < PROPFEMALE > Scherette , < PROPFEMALE > Karimi , Kodi Katastrophic , and so many others . :3 Now it's time to relax , actually eat and find all those pictures . xD 
If you care about her or want to be with her then you should tell her . Because even if she would like to , she can't wait around forever . ? 
had a blast tonight . xD Had people tell me I'm going to hell , had a woman ask me to ' cover for her ' while she peed in the grass and just .. omfg . Tonight was epic lmao 
I just ran around with a can of hairspary killing a bunch of ants while yelling ' YEAH MOTHERFUCKER ! WHATCHA GONNA DO NOW ?! FEAR MEEEE!' ... And I wonder why people think I'm crazy ? XD 
If I’m not the one thing you can’t stand to lose . If I’m not that arrow to the heart of you . If you don’t get drunk on my kiss . If you think you can do better than this then I guess we’re done . Let’s not drag this on ! Consider me gone ! -- Consider Me Gone by < PROPFEMALE > McEntire <3 
woke up feeling like hell . =/ Everything is sore and I just don't want to move from bed . 
is so amused . I just changed my language on facebook to ' Pirate ' . <3 Meanwhile , I'm plotting moving with < PROPFEMALE > Mattison , and I'm trying to see my Lake Worth friends tonight ! =D 
isn't going to let the fact that one person doesn't want me to do something stop me . I'm going to live my life how I want to , and I'm going to do what will make me happy and what's in my best interest . If you can't understand that , then I'm sorry but you're going to have to get over it . :3 
My second mother/Momma < PROPFEMALE > Cawley is in the hospital . She's in the starting stages of a coma . I really don't know what to do . Please , please keep her in your thoughts and prayers . 
goin ' for a walk . ;3 Later . 
is going to attempt to get some sleep . <3 I love ya'll . So good night , sweet dreams and leave me something nice to wake up to ? =D 
Chillin ' at home with teh friends while helping Mom get the house ready for the upcoming school year . =p 
Keep thinking that you can control everything that I do . Lets see how far that will get you . 
How can one person make me want to beat them in the head with a shovel .... and make me want to hug them all during the same conversation ? O_o ; 
has to stay up all night so I can go with daddy at 4 am to go see < PROPFIRST > Pfundheller and family . Ahhh , ima be so tired . DX 
is getting the rest of her stuff ready . Yay ! I'm leaving in 45 minutes . @-@ 
So , somebody hacked my facebook and had decided to change the password . And they did this after hacking < PROPFIRST > Pfundheller facebook . Whoever is doing this needs to quit now . It's not fucking funny . 
Probably deleting my account tonight . >-< Damn hackers . 
Obviously I'm not worth you keeping your promises to , making plans with , or really even being friends with . Why do I stick around when I know that this is all I'm going to get ? 
is gettin ' ready for the concert tonight . :3 Let me know if you're going to be there ! 
Just got back from the concert ! It was amazing ~ The whole place was packed . :D Only bad part was I had to be taken home by a cop lmao . 
Bitches and hoes , they just don't know ! Ahhh , dedicated towards the person that says it one too many times so obviously he's saying something about himselllllllllllllllf . =D Buwahahahahahaha 
Listening to my mix of Psychopathic Records artists . :3 Waiting for dinner and brownies to be done .

Regardless of whats going on or how upset I may be , DracoxHermione fanfiction and techno music can always make me laugh . <3

Just got back from the concert . xD The concert itself was boring , but the people from Frightnights SouthFloridafair made it epic . <3 
' You have to be 16 to volunteer there . ' ' People think I'm 16 already . ' ' You need your birth certificate . ' ' I could fake it . I mean , look at Obama . ' -- Ahhhh , I love my little sister . xD

Has been adopted by Aliana < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > Rivera mother . xD So I do believe I have found a new place to live ! YAY NEW SISTERS/FAMILY ! XD 
Ahhh , love how I'm always second best in everybody's eyes . 
Wishes that people would be able to understand that things take time and that changes do happen , regardless of what they think they see . In order to understand that a transformation has begun or is underway one would have to see the first glimpses of it in person where it's more noticeable . 
Ahhh it's either a redneck or a goth , decisions decisions . <3 
Time for a photoshoot with Aliana < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > Rivera . And I freaking love < PROPFIRST > Branden ~ ! Thank yooooooooooooou ~~~~ ! 
So almost fell off the railing from the second floor lmao . 
After the show-oh oh oh . No one will ever know , I wanna touch your microphone . Now that we're all alone no one will ever know . I wanna touch your microphone ~ ! 
just got home after spending almost a week at Aliana < PROPMALE>'s house . :3 Now to clean everything , relax and I get to go back this Thrusday/Friday ! YAY ! xD 
Letters start with A-B-C . < PROPFIRST > start with 1-2-3 . Music starts with Do-Re-Me . And love starts with You-And-Me . <3 Wishin ' I was with people right now ~ 
Sorta wants to go steal a copy of Halo at midnight . >_> 
Doing some basic photoshopping to some pictures . <3 
I think I honestly forgot how much I really do love country music , my cowboy boots , my hat , my redneck friends and their trucks and everything that goes along with it . <3 
wants to watch The Devil's Rejects with somebody . </3 
Pray for me ' cause I have lost my faith in holy wars . Is paradise denied to me ' cause I can't take no more ? Has darkness taken over me and consumed my mortal soul ? -- Name the song . xD 
Thanks to my mad make-up skills , my little sister now looks like a bloody zombie . xD 
Well , tonight has been just a pure disappointment . Thus why I don't like getting my hopes up . 
Rule #19 - When making a female promise something make sure you are very specific and leave no room for loop-holes . They will find them , and they will get around your promise if you don't . 
Going to bed . Yay for more broken promises to add to the list . 
And the lightnin ' strikes , another love grows cold on a sleepless night as the storm blows on . Out of control , deep in her heart the thunder rolls ... 
I need to get out of my house before I break something . Anybody want to go out for a couple hours or something ? Please ? 
The rumors flew but nobody knew how much she blamed herself . For years and years , she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath . She finally drank her pain away , a little at a time . But she never could get drunk enough to get him off her mind . Until the night ..... -- Whiskey Lullaby by < PROPMALE > Paisley 
is an idiot . I blew off two days worth of plans to sit home waiting ... and I'm still waiting . Somebody just come smack me please . 
Made me crack up laughing because how true it is . xD\

If you had to choose between living a long , heathy life but being alone the whole time or being terminally ill but having the love of your life by your side , which one would you pick ? 
If you were to rate my physical appearance on a scale of 1-10 , what would you rate me ? Answer honestly ! :3 
has been up all night talking to < PROPFIRST > Pfundheller . Now time to attempt this whole ' sleeping ' thing and hopefully I won't get yelled at for something I didn't do in the first place . =.=; So that way , < PROPFIRST > won't crack up laughing while I ' sound like a puppy ' . XD 
< PROPFEMALE > won the creative battle , but I so won the fight . <3 
Even my own mother told me I don't belong here . xD She's actually dubbed me ' Redneck ' and a true ' Southern Rebel ' . Not just because of my personality , but because of the way I fight . Hell yes . <3 
Gettin ' ready to go out to eat and find something to do with the smaller sibling . :3 Wanna get a hold of me ? Call my cell phone . <3 
is getting her things ready for tomorrow when she gets to see < PROPFIRST > Pfundheller , and hopefully Aliana < PROPMALE > . 
going to try to get a nap in . Wish I could go to Rascal Flatts tonight . =/ Meh . Need to get a hold of me ? I don't have texting and can only talk to people on AT&T but my < PROPFIRST > ( 561 ) 339-2756 . 
is waiting for her mom to get home so she can finally go to < PROPFIRST>'s . =.= 
What was supposed to be an amazing day just didn't happen . So not only did it not happen but all throughout the day it progressively got worse . Then when I think it'll all be okay , GUESS WHAT ?! IT GOT WORSE . =__= Anybody wanna come and save me ? 
You know , if you didn't want to < PROPFEMALE > out with me , you should of just said so . >_> So now , before I go nuts from sitting at home , does anybody wanna go out ? xD 
found out you can punch trees without worrying . However , just because your bookshelf is made of wood it does not mean you'll have the same result . They dent . Lesson learned . <3 
Yo ho , yo ho a pirates life for me . </3 \ 
All I need is a bottle of rum and then I would be an actual pirate and it would save this night for being a total failure . 
Reading for the time being , going to bed sooner or later so I can get up in the morning to go see < PROPFIRST > Pfundheller . Which better happen this time . >_> 
Had an amazing day with < PROPFIRST > Pfundheller and did a couple things that may just possibly of been illegal ( Buwahah , I'm such a bad influence xD ) and now I'm spending the night and raisin ' more hell with Aliana < PROPMALE > 
is going out with Aliana < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > Rivera , and < PROPFIRST > Pfundheller . =D

Yes , I wanted to go and work out . But not as soon as I wake up . xD I feel like a zombie . 
Fanfuckingtastic . =/ 
If you are reading this , I don't care if we've spoken once or 100 times , post a comment ofthe FIRST memory you have with me that pops into your head . When you've finished , post this paragraph as your own status . You'll be surprised what people remember about you ? 
is gettin ' ready to go home for the first time in like a week . xD Tomorrow , Bowling . Friday Iunno yet . Saturday , clubbing ! Sunday , Orientation ~ 
Got home like an hour and a half ago and as soon as I walked in , mom shut off the internet , took away my cell phone and the house phone .... >_> Yay for her falling asleep and me stealing my cell and the internet back . xD 
Loves how apparently I'm the only one that has changing to do and how I'm the ' sneeky ' one that keeps things from people . So I guess it's fine for you to go do things I asked you not to . Double standards much ? Fuck this . Anybody up for a party ? :P 
I know now a lot of my friends on here pray , but ... to anybody that would be willing to my Grandmother/ < PROPFEMALE > who is 81 years old is going into surgery to have breast cancer removed . I'm scared to death and honestly don't know what I would do if I lost her . If you could , please just keep her in your thoughts and prayers . Because even when my world is crashing down , I know I can run to < PROPFEMALE > for everything . <3 
Heading to the hospital now . =/ If you don't know what about , check my last status . Please keep her in your prayers . I can only take calls from AT&T but feel free to call . ( 561 ) 339-2765 . Been up all night too . -sigh- 
Thank you everybody for your thoughts and prayers . :3 < PROPFEMALE>'s surgery went fine and we're all back home ! =D AND To top it all off , I'm back in Malpractice for Frightnights SouthFloridafair ! Good day ? I think so . <3 
Country music , southern comfort food , in a bit I'll be watching Urban Cowboy all while laying in my bed . <3 Only thing that would make this better is if I had my personal reneck boy to cuddle with . <3 ( You know who you are , and yes . I called you a redneck . What of it ? ) 
I hate waiting for phone calls . SO much . =.=; Now I'm just waiting to see if we're all still going to the club tonight . :3 
Why is it a Saturday night yet absolutely nothing is going on ? 
Interesting yet fun night . <3 Orientation for Fright Nights in the morning . <3 
Had an amazing time at Orientation today . :3 It was nice seeing/goofing off with everybody ! And now I'm with < PROPFIRST > Pfundheller and his family until later . :3

Is really hyper and really bored all at the same time which probably isn't a very good combination . xD 
I've tried all I can imagine . I've begged and pleaded in true lover's fashion . I've got pride I'm takin ' it for a ride . Bye bye , bye bye my baby , bye bye . -- Bye Bye by < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Messina . When all else fails , just turn on WIRK . 
Just woke up , and I still feel tired . xD Anythin ' going on tonight ? 
sittin ' at home freezing to the point my fingers are going numb . xD Annnd I'm looking for a story to read . 
Apparently , after glomping Aliana < PROPMALE > at Orientation yesterday ' glomping ' a person became a form of punishment . ;-; Boooo . 
Anybody up for a gothic lingerie party ? 
Been on the phone pretty much all day . XD And now it's time for bed . Hopefully I can actually get to sleep sometime soon . Nighty Night and sweet dreams . <3 
Half asleep and getting dressed to go to lake worth . Give me a call if you want while I'm in the area ?

Put this as your status if you know or are related to someone who was killed at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry when it was undersiege by death eaters during the second wizarding war . Over 50 citizens died in this terrorist attack . 93% of people ; muggle scum , won't re-post this , but will you be part of that magical 7% . Repost this to show your support for Dumbledore's Army . 
Why are people throwing eggs and Voltorbs out the window ? The hell , man .

Alivia and I : -tackle < PROPFIRST > and start tickling the hell out of him-\

Before you jump to conclusions and assume things , maybe you should be PATIENT and actually ask me things first . But I'm the immature one , right ? 
Fuck all the drama , I'm not dealing with it . :3 Tonight is to celebrate my little sisters 13th birthday and my < PROPFEMALE>'s 82 birthday . <3 Nothing is going to ruin it .

Nope , can't turn a hoe into a housewife . :3 Also can't turn a self-centered , immature , head up their ass emo-kid into somebody bearable . And by the way , those aren't just my words . You should ask your ' brother ' about it too . 
Excited and happy beyond all belief . <3 Now a certain somebody needs to wake up and call meeeee . xD

Doesn't like feeling sick or having the feeling somebody is hiding something from you . Isn't fun . 
' The other < PROPFEMALE > would take your $100 , do everything and then give you back your change . ' 
I love my nails , but I can't type or do anything in them . lmao This is gonna take some getting used to . 
If you want to hide something from a person , then at least try not to make it so obvious . 
If you don't like when i do certain things then maybe you shouldn't do them either . 8D kthx .

Going to bed with my amazing , loving and caring fiance < PROPFIRST > Pfundheller . Sleepy sleep , then adventures tomorrow . <3 
Sophistication isn't what you wear , or who you know . Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go . They didn't teach you that in prep school\ 
so it's up to me , but no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity . 
Ignoring my nicotine fit and reading . -twitch- 
My phone died . I am now sad . 
Is seriously starting to get aggravated . 
Anybody want to < PROPFEMALE > out today ? DX 
Had a fun night with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > Dollface , and < PROPFIRST > Pfundheller . <3 Needs to happen more often . :P

I love how people automatically assume that just because they know < PROPFIRST > and I , that they're invited to the wedding . We want a smaller , personal ceremony , not some huge party .

Zombie Aids- Not this week 
It feels like my ovaries are gonna ' splode . I don't want them anymore , plzkthx . 
Why am I awake ? Oh yeah . Because SOMEBODY wants to play Fiesta all night . -headdesk- 
You'd think people would realize you don't want to be their ' friend ' when you deny their friend request four times . 
Happy Birthday to < PROPFIRST > Pfundheller who is now 21 . <3 Spending the day with him ~ ! 
Rude much ? Yes , I think so .

Ahahahaha . xD You wanted to fight legally , then lets do this . ;D 
' < PROPFEMALE > showed me I can actually obtain sanity and happiness . She has gotten me to do so many thing that I usually wouldn't do , like breaking morals . She's my best-friend , my partner in crime , the missing piece of my life , the love of my life , and the girl I want to marry and have a family with . She was my world , I love the fact she was the first person I talked to and the last everyday . ' <3 I love you too , < PROPFIRST > .

So ... we need a pair of size 10 male dress shoes . xD Anybody have a pair we could borrow for maybe half an hour for one day ? 
And now , < PROPFEMALE > ish sad . 
I'll just put on my smile . Why show that it bothers me ? Just sit here in my denial and send up my silent plea . 
It's nights like tonight that make me miss my party days . xD 
Food time ~ Then talking with my love < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > while plotting certain things with < PROPFIRST > Cross . buwahahaha . XDDD ( Please don't kill me < PROPFEMALE > , I love you . Just remember that . <3 )

Having a yardsale with a bunch of stuff . xD You should come by and check it out . 
I don't mind sharing . I really don't care and it's fine with me . But if you assume and take things without the common fucking courtesy of asking first , then I'm going to get pissed . 
Anybody wanna < PROPFEMALE > or do something with < PROPFIRST > Pfundheller , < PROPFIRST > Novak and I tonight ? xD Is ANYTHING going on ? :P It's a Saturday night , come on people . 
Well , I sense large amounts of bullshit going on .
