Special Education week was March 22nd to the 26th . People need to understand that special needs children don't have an illness , they are not looking for a cure , only acceptance . Statistics say 93% of people won't copy and paste this ~ will you be in the 7% that will and leave it on your status for at least an hour ? 
Updating my résumé . 
Walked and jogged my dog without his leash for 2 < PROPMALE > around my neighborhood . It was awesome ! Love the weather ! 
Just finished walk/jog my dog around the neighborhood twice ... So it was a little over 2 < PROPMALE > . The weather is much chillier than yesterday's climate . I ended up not sweating as much today ... I suppose that's a good thing that I don't stink so bad ... LOL . 
< PROPFIRST > and I just finished our 2 mile walk/ jog/ run . I'm sweaty and in need of a shower but I have to go to Sutherland for my dad . Maybe I should stay stinky the whole day ... Worth comtemplating ... I'm tired ... =) 
Today , < PROPFIRST > and I received a surprise attack while on our 3 mile walk/ jog . We were on our last mile , < PROPFIRST > without his leash on was walking next to me .
