Heroin is bad . If you ever consider trying heroin , you shouldn't . here are some pretty good reasons :\

Number Bullshit ? I'm in . 
2 : We got into a huggeeeee fight forever ago , but thats all over now and i'm glad we're close again . i better see you over break :P <3 
13 : YOU ARE SO FRICKIN ' IMPATIENT . love you :) 
9 : firstly , i find who you're dating terribly ironic , but i'm glad you're happy . I'd love to get off your shit list if thats ever possible . but knowing you , i highly doubt it , and that's fair . However , I still wish you the best and rumor has it you're quite the friend . 
711 : sorry , i already posted this but it like deleted itself ? you're such a pain sometimes , but i do consider you somewhat of i friend , and i hope that you'll eventually find a way to be less defensive in regards to me 
7 : You're adorable so so so adorable i love you to death , but you have a terrible taste in pictures of yourself and never seem to recognize your beauty . Also , you flirt maybe a little too much , and thats coming from me . and you can be a < PROPMALE > flaky or bratty sometimes :) buttttt i love youuuuu <3 <3 
135 : I LOVEEEEEE YOUUUUUUUUUU :) :) :) :) you are soooooooooo reliable ! and you're always there for me and somehow cheer me up :) i'm sorry about prucha .. but he'll be back :) i'm glad you're a yotes fan now :) :) and you still need to take me to engrained or however you spell it , hope you get to stay over christmas break that would be amazing !! <3 
23 : you sooo would pick 23 :P i misss you :( you're all far away .. but at least i know you owe me a visit over winter break :D can't wait to see you , even though you STILL act so shy around me :P i don't get itt 
415 : You are such an amazing teacher !! :) :) i'm soooooo glad i took AP Chem with you :) i know that stuff sooo well now , i can't wait to come visit over winter break when i actually have my car back\ 
p.s. i love that we keep in touchh :) 
2222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222 : Thats the right amount of 2's you can check if you want , i counted . :] Hmm .. I love you , and always will , i'm glad we're on good terms again , i'm also glad you ended up at asu , you being all the way in tucson would have been terrible . p.s. the < PROPFEMALE > . 
5 : you are soooo eccentric but quite awesome :) i'm glad i got to know you and < PROPFEMALE > out with you i just wish it were a little more often , and i wish some of a certain someones friends were a little better when it comes to you :/ miss you 
117 : I can't wait to watch the rangers lose to the coyotes in the < PROPMALE > cup finals <3 
007 : i'm really glad i met you even though it was extremelyyyy random , wow i just looked down and noticed that you said that too :D i hope you eventually sort out all of your boy troubles , and then decide to keep me in the loop upon doing so , also , we neeeeeeeeed to < PROPFEMALE > out more , since we basically never do :P 
250 : i gotta say , for someone i've never met you know me better than most people . I'm glad you stuck around following my host for those few games of gears that turned into hundreds maybe thousands , gotta say i agree with the tag team comment and i love how it works in every single game we play , 
250 cont : which is why you need to buy nhl 11 , it would be epic . And i get the feeling we'll meet eventually , its bound to happen . and the girls dont stand a < PROPMALE > XD 
LEGENDDDDDDDDD [ if you know what i'm talking about , you have ownership of at least a piece of my heart ] 
96 : You're an asssssss clown XD but it'll be cool to see you once you're down in az miss you good old days on GOW1 
13 : I love you to death , i have for quite a while know and i always will . You're one of my best friends , and i can count on you for anything , most of the time . I'm pretty sure if you were in Mesa we'd be dating right now . I can't standdddddddd how stubborn you can be sometimes ... especially with certain thoughts .. and how insanely jealous you got about it , among other things . 
13 cont : I'm also not a big fan of how lowly you value yourself sometimes .. especially since i'm fully aware that at least a little bit of it is an act ... all that said .. i do love youuuu and i miss the lunches .. 
ohhh shittt 
9 : You mean so so so so much to me , and i can never seem to get you out of my head . You're adorable , and i love how well we get along . that said .. i hateeee how despite how smart you and i both know you are , you act sooooooo incredibly stupidddd just because you don't respect yourself .. i don't understand it . 
9 cont : It's like you don't even know how much you mean to sooooo many people because you're always focusing on the people who don't \really\ " give a fuck about you . thank god you're still alive . " 
6 : I love you man , i hate that we fell out , and regret letting it happen , i should have fought tooth and nail to avoid it , but i didn't . However , it does seem as though the sun is begining to appear over the horizon once more , and i'm glad to see your face around these parts again . 
6 cont : If you ever need ANYTHING , you know i'd drop what i'm doing in a heart beat cause i know you'de do the same for me . on a lighter note , i'm better than you at risk :) and on an end note , pine tree . 
Bachman is shitting soooo many bricks right now

Dear best friend , \ 
idk why you're being so dramatic about everything , i'm not angry nor am i ignoring you , we just haven't talked in a massive , two days . , but i'm glad that you dont care that you werent invited , i wouldn't want to upset you . 
Dear Best Friend , \ 
i figured you wouldn't want to go since september was going to be there , and i would have rather avoided a total freak out in regards to my love for her . \ 
p.s. the only person i've seen more than twice this break is < PROPFIRST > , you're tied for second sweetie , maybe if you made an effort to < PROPFEMALE > out , i'd take you up on it . 
I haven't received a text from you since january third , which i promptly answered , if i recall correctly i was apologizing for whatever it is you were upset about . So yes its true that i may have not asked you specifically to < PROPFEMALE > out in the last four days , despite the fact that you seem busy . 
Also i find it hard believe that you don't care about the september issue considering you haven't dropped it for 4 months even though you keep not caring about it , hence why you weren't invited to the hockey game . Multiple sources agreed that inviting you both was an extremely unwise tactical decision . I'm sorry to hear this upsets you as i thought you didn't care . 
Dear General Public , \ 
I apologize for the fact that all of this stupidity is clogging up your news feed .
