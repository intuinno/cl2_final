I am exhausted . 

Well everyone , I have surgery on my thumb tomorrow . Not life threatening , I know , bit a pain in the ass nonetheless . 
Crazy night ... A shitty night by fourth of july standards ... but crazy nonetheless 
I want to .... bake something . 
Happy birthday < PROPFIRST > , but don't eat too much cake . I don't like me a fat < PROPFIRST > . 
I just painted my ass off since about one'o'clock . With intermittent < PROPMALE > and cheese breaks . New album with pics 
Ok enough facebook quizzes . 
Time to adventure . 
I better learn to fly soon ... I'm gettin ' real tired of weighing down the bird in my life 
\I personally have no < PROPFEMALE > in the matter and continue to fly by the seat of my pants . \"" 
Thinks the Boys with Buoyancy need a reunion . 
Fist college load of laundry = < PROPMALE > . 
let me rephrase that : First college load of laundry = < PROPMALE > because < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > and AO weren't there to make it fun . I miss you fellas 
Crazyness ensued . 
There are objects of affection That can mesmerize the soul There is always one addiction That just cannot be controlled 
mistake ? 
Common sense is the least common of the senses . 
< PROPFIRST > City Limits music festival ... In the rain ... lovin ' it . Bon Iver was especially epic 
I'm good I suppose ... I feel a little unfulfilled ... Like I'm missing something that should be painfully apparent but I cannot for the life of me ascertain what it may be . It's like my own personal pollen missing from the air . The wind should be carrying it to me , the bees should nuzzle me with it but for whatever reason it is gone . 
I'm < PROPMALE > from where you are , I lay down on the cold groundI pray that something picks me upAnd sets me down in your warm arms 
Oh , what good is it to live with nothing left to give Forget but not forgive , not loving all you see Oh , the streets you're walking on a thousand houses long Well , that's where I belong and you belong with me Not swallowed in the sea 
Thanks for the well wishes everyone 
I hate financial statements . Not because they are difficult , but because they are boring . 
My profile picture features a mysterious bottle ... It has mystical properties that allow it to appear in my room . 
But please , remember me , my misery , And how it lost me all I wanted . Those dogs that love the rain and chasing trains , The colored birds above their running , In circles around the well and where it spells , On the wall behind St. < PROPFIRST > , So bright , on cinder gray , in spray paint , \Who the hell can see forever ? \"" 
I detect a blooming and/or snuffed romance between < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > Lomba . PL+JL = inL . ( more to come ) 
I was attacked by a raccoon . shitty . 
Having hope is like looking through a spyglass . You can pull and strain to bring your ambitions into focus , but you create nothing but tunnel vision . Everything is still the same . Even if you allow yourself to be tricked by the science of optics , making ten < PROPMALE > look like ten inches , everything is still out of reach . Nothing ever changes , but you will still pay another nickel for another look . 
I love my job . I got paid to go to ballet today 
I'm so tired , I haven't slept a wink , I'm so tired , my mind is on the blink , I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink ? No , no , no . I'm so tired I don't know what to do , I'm so tired , my mind is set on you , I wonder should I call you , but I know what you would do 
Well , back to the same old same old . 
IM A ZOMB .... 
Ashes to ashes , dust to dust , beaker base to shattered glass shards .

Last night I was picked up by the cops just outside my Aunt's house . I had no jacket and no boots , and taken to the salvation army shelter . They wouldn't believe me that I lived in the house I just walked out of . They Thought I was crazy when I told them I was American here visiting my Aunt . They almost submitted me to a mental institution . 
Then the shelter was full , so at first they wouldn't open the doors to me . My feet in the meantime , were literally freezing . Frostnip sucks .... It took me HOURS before I could collect call my family and tell them where I was .... I will upload the video that my step dad took as he picked me up . He and my Uncle thought it has hysterical .
