Ayumi is getting married to Mannie ! So it wasn't an act ! o.o 

Eastover , the little no-stop-light town I live on the edge of , is dropping a flea down a pole for new years . A 3ft , 36lb FLEA ! Why ?? I swear , my dad and I were trying to figure out what dropping a flea meant , and we thought it was a real flea in a glass jar . That might be better . XD 
HAPPY NEW YEAR ! * goes to watch < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > * 
The hair dye urge is back . NO ! 
Even with all the toxic substances in the world , the mind is the deadliest ' substance ' of all . 
Wow . So much for sleeping . o.o 
Must start schoolwork again . x_x I hate time off . 
I've had WAY too much energy the last few days . Anyone need some extra ? x_x 
I'm reading between several books : The Spirituality of the Cross , Law and Gospel , and Great American Short Stories . I decided to bite the bullet , and just read Law and Gospel online . @_@ 
Okay ... I don't like how FB interests system works now . Just because I like something , it doesn't mean I want to watch their pages . Stupid ! 
I miss Communion . :| 
Why do Christian women think it's okay to dress slutty in SL ? Seriously ? ( Yes , I've had my moments too , I know . XP ) 
I'm looking for a < PROPFEMALE > on symbolic colors and such in Christianity ... 
The cotton filled jewelry boxes arrived ... 
Finally got the last two seasons of Gilmore Girls this weekend ... I haven't seen any of these . :D 
Now why did I bother getting a FB again ? It just makes me mad . 
Someone needs to invent a small handheld scanner that you can use to scan lines of text from a book into the computer as text in a word processing program . I'd take notes like crazy then . 
I'm back . I had an idea . :P 
MBTI : I swear I've run all over the map with MBTI ... INFP , INFJ , INTJ , ISFP , etc . I gave up , and < PROPFEMALE > figured it out in 20 minutes to INTP . Then I bought and read two MBTI books that explained each part and gave examples ( so helpful ) ... ENTP with some SF influence . 
I wish I could block links on facebook . Actually everything except status updates and photos . On the one hand , you have flexibility in who sees what you post , but no flexibility in what you have to see on your feed . You have to flat out hide * everything * a person posts , not just parts . * kicks facebook * 
You know , capitalism is a disease just as much as socialism or communism or any other form of human government and economic theory . Capitalism is not special or horrific ; they have all their pros and cons . Just sick of seeing people griping about capitalism as if it's Satan's spawn . 
Did you see that < PROPFEMALE > McCarthy ( Sookie on Gilmore Girls ) is going to be in a new show ? < PROPFIRST > & < PROPFEMALE > ... 
Thinking about * really * getting back on LJ ... 
Has it really been nine years ? I suppose the incessant presence on the news has made it seem like less time . 
If I hear any more about responsible and sustainable food production , I might scream . I woud point you to a Foreign Policy article on the subject , but I need to scan it . I might do that later . ;P ( No offense intended . :D ) 
Changes are afoot . 
First Ladies ought to sign an affidavit when their husband is elected , stating that they understand the American people elected their husband ... not the wife too . ( And vice versa if a woman is elected . ) 
The more men speak , the more remaining single looks good . -_-; 
Jesus was not just a man , the miracles were real , there is only one true religion and way to salvation . * is in anti-people mode * 
I am honestly complaining about having too much energy . What's wrong with me ? XD 
* peeks out from under the covers * It's morning already ? 
“The\ 
best way to waste your life , ... is by taking notes . The easiest way to\ 
avoid living is to just watch . Look for the details . Report . Don't \ 
participate . ” ( < PROPMALE > Palahniuk ) 
NOW I'm starting to understand what people mean when they say MBTI descriptions are totally useless . I match the cognitive functions order of ENTP , but the descriptions are crappy . Plus [ a lot of ] other so-called ENTPs strike me as self-absorbed jerks . Eh , whatever . 
So . My back hurts from yoga . * scowls * 
So the person who wanted an American meal the other night has suggested Japanese for supper . I'm laughing on the inside . XD 
WORD\ 
GAME ! Leave a 1-word comment that you think best describes me beginning\ 
with the 3rd letter of YOUR first name . No repeats . Then copy & \ 
paste this to your wall , so I can leave a word about you ! 
So ... what if everything is a farce ? 
When I was a kid , I didn't believe in < PROPFEMALE > , the Tooth < PROPFEMALE > , or the Easter < PROPFEMALE > , but I thought Bozo the clown lived in the girls restroom at school . ( I.E. Flush and RUN ! ) Go figure . 
* yawns * 
Reading the things men say online makes a girl want to take martial arts . 
What was the last song you listened to ? 
Just so you know , we have enough team points on Bejeweled Blitz to sign up for the weekly drawing . :) < PROPFEMALE > Evans McDowell < PROPFEMALE > Smith 
Always great fun to have sleep interrupted with back pains . o.O ; 
So . I thought it over , and it only makes logical sense that God exists and since God exists , the only one that makes sense is the God of the Bible . 
Trying out Ubuntu again . :D 
Cilantro <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 ( not enough <3 ;)) 
Where are you guys on SL ? ;) 
So , I got tomato sauce on the burner , on the walls , on the floor , on my dress , and burnt my finger . But , the homemade spaghetti o's are great . I just need to use a bigger pan next time . XD 
feels like a little piggy . OINK ! 
BORED ! 
< PROPFEMALE > Plath's son committed suicide too ? :\\ 
Should I keep the bangs or grow them out ? 
is in a personality chat , and two folks are discussing 1 ) How to deal drugs and 2 ) What personality type is most suited for it . o.O 
Gonna try yoga again ... let's hope my back doesn't get weird again . :D 
So how many of you are ailurophiles ? ;) 
I /was/ going to lay in bed and read some of \Why I Am A Lutheran\ " but the noisy < PROPFIRST > got me up and out of bed . bah ! " 
You know ... I can make plans just fine . But the problem is actually doing them . It's like the plan is \oh that's nice ... \ " but it holds no meaning . " 
My mom made supper ... a feast . o.O Fried pork chops , lima beans ( with a whole stick of butter ! ) , fried potatoes , biscuits , banana nut bread . Lookit all the carbs , < PROPFEMALE > ! ( I did really well though ... coffee in a bit for me . :D ) ( I suppose not everyone wants to hear about this stuff ? lol ) 
Apple sauce is one of the most disgusting things ever . 
Recommend a book for me to read . Twilight does not count . 
Gotta love it when < PROPMALE > pushes < PROPMALE > into the water after their argument in \Nick & Nora/Sid & Nancy\ " . >:D ( Gilmore Girls ) " 
I think my folks are dreaming about Oklahoma again . * totally ignores them * 
CPH order came ! Treasury of Daily Prayer cd and a study book . :D 
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ! ( Just finished watching the season finale of Warehouse 13 . ) :( One of my favorite characters . :( 
Not done reading The < PROPFEMALE > Jar yet , but it's junk . 
My circle of unmarried/engaged friends is rapidly shrinking . o.O ; 
Okie Dokie . I am NOT going to school at < PROPFEMALE > . 
is traumatized by the singing cat on the Quiznos commercial . 
I can change my mind about doctrines and such , but the idea of converting for someone else just creeps me out . Wonder what that says about me . LOL 
My wrists now predict the rain . :| 
I wish I understood the reasoning behind liberalism and democrat ideas . 
The sun is shining after being covered over for two days by rain , so I'm very happy . Good morning . ;) 
Signing up on a penpals site . * crosses fingers * Hope I don't get any freaks . :P 
Darn kids think they know everything at 18 . 
You know ... sometimes people change and you have to wonder at what point did they lose their brain ... 
Bill ... Oh Bill ... You could've answered Maher on the OT saying to kill your neighbor if you see him working on Sunday by saying that Jesus fulfilled the Law . But , no . You totally dodged the question ( a very EASY one to answer ) and looked like an idiot Christian who can't use his brain . sigh ( O'Reilly is on ... ) 
Never going to understand people who say that when you talk online , you are talking to a computer and not a person . Huh ? How does that work exactly ? 
Anyone know anything about polyphasic sleep ? 
To < PROPFIRST > Jung : GOOMH ! 
W00t time to pull the winter clothes out ! Tights , sweaters , and boots <3 
66f and cloudy . :D Okay , :P to the cloudy part ... 
Outside . On the computer . It's < PROPFEMALE > and in the 70's . Perfect . :D 
@#$%#$% Gmail spam filter ! Just because an email is from a yahoo email , doesn't make it SPAM ! 
Mmm soba for lunch . 
What part of ' do not hit on me ' do you not understand ? D:< 
Meatloaf , mashed potatoes/gravy , beets , biscuits . My mom made supper . ^_^ 
One month to 27 . @_@ 
The nice thing about writing letters via email is I can respond to whatever I want first , and then rearrange the text to proper order . Can't do that on paper . :| 
“When I get a little money I buy books ; and if any is left I buy food and clothes . ” ~ Erasmus 
Wow . The things you learn about your family . o.O 
I found my webcam ! ( I thought it had accidentally fallen into the trash , but it was in a pocket of an old backpack . :P ) 
< PROPFEMALE > ??????????, listing books ... got one called \Godly Materialism\ " ... lol " 
Drawback of going to bed early : waking at 3:30 am . Again . : -x 
Last night , I dreamed that someone gave me a gift to save for < PROPFEMALE > Watts Brown's birthday , but I accidentally set it off ( it was some kind of music thing o.O ) ... Then I dreamed that < PROPFEMALE > Tramell felt bad , so I bought chocolate martini mix and weird candies like the inside of skittles . LOL Strange ... 
Yes . The day I go to see if I qualify for student loans , the darn site is down for the holiday weekend . lol 
has applied to Kaplan . ;) 
Baaaah I sound like an idiot on the phone . 
Uncle < PROPFIRST > wants to give me money . ;) 
Kids , don't sit in the floor for 2 hours while you bead . Just don't do it . 
My dad , \Are you SURE you want to be a shrink ?? \ " haha :P " 
I am in college . o.O 
The sky is schizo today . One minute it's < PROPFEMALE > , the next it is cloudy . 
is sick . :| 
saw a license plate : \2OLD4U \"" 
The first 4 or so months of this year were crap , but it is turning out to be a better year than the previous one . I don't think I've ever said that ... 
Good morning . *_* 
Of course , I call when they are updating the class registration system . >_> 
I was washing my face last night when I dropped the cloth on the floor , so I bent over to pick it up ... Only I had the sink cabinet door open and jammed the corner of the door into my right cheekbone . Now my head has pain radiating through half of it , making it hard to sleep . UGH . Oh , I also stepped on a needle later on . x_x The cats dragged it out of my beading board . :| 
Really don't like how the Google home < PROPFEMALE > \scrolls\ " now . It jumps from search result to result instead of scrolling the < PROPFEMALE > like normal . Don't care for the photo search format now either . Why do they have to change what isn't broken ? " 
Lunch : grilled cheese , potato chips , and whole baby dill pickles . Reminds me of lunches from when I was a kid . :P 
Who put my face in a vise overnight ?? Ouch . Headache . x_x 
We need the cloudy days to appreciate the < PROPFEMALE > days . ' Cause we're dull like that . ;P 
Yea ! Found a bunch of music that I thought was permanently gone . :D 
ordered 1000 blank flash cards . o.O 
Ever had one of those moments where a bunch of mental puzzle pieces fall into place and make sense ? Had one of those today , only I wish it was of a more pleasant nature . sigh . 
I just love bouncing bank transactions . :| 
Nice . Allergic reaction to Dr. Bronner's castile soap , of all things ... 
Weird dreams . x_x 
I love shopping at used bookstores . :D 
So , I forgot about the Kaplan Time Management seminar tonight because I was hanging up laundry . How ironic . XD 
So odd to run across old journal entries . I don't even remember writing them . 
Dear Movie and TV Industry : Please stop making superhero movies and tv shows . It's getting old . : -x 
Awesome . Just burned the index finger of my writing hand . 
It boggles my mind that so many intelligent people accept the hypothesis of evolution as truth . It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever . >_< 
feels sick . : -x 
is thinking about buying a kindle . >_> 
NOTHING that comes premade out of a freezer box is restaurant quality . ( Yes , I'm talking back to the tv . ) 
Don't forget to have decaf tea with supper , or you'll wind up awake at 1:30 am like me . ;) 
Yay for new friends ! 
is really liking the ability to hide individual posts by people ! 
Ayu's Love Songs is my Christmas present . * waves goodbye to $53 * 
All I'm getting is more and more questions and no answers . 
Tonight is orientation ... must not forget ! 
Oh , I have to say it . I hope < PROPFIRST > Fallin wins the governorship in Oklahoma ! I've met her , she's a nice lady . :D She was Lt . Governor when I was a < PROPFEMALE > at the state legislature . :) 
So much for the ' throw the bums out ' sentiment because all the bums stayed in office in my state . lol 
Ding , < PROPFIRST > , the witch is dead . 0 =) 
saw Farmville gift cards while out today . Farmville ? Seriously ? 
So I'm looking at Penpal ads , and this person lists as their Primary Language , \Java and C . \ " LOL " 
What the heck is Diwali ? Fox News is having ' happy Diwali ' or something ads . o.O 
Tomorrow we're going to < PROPMALE > -- CPK and Super Target . :D 
Did everyone have mass amnesia about today ? LOL Too funny . 
\Maybe the parasite got into her brain and ate away the part that fell in love with you . \ " ( < PROPMALE > to < PROPMALE > about < PROPFIRST > on Gilmore Girls ) XD " 
Never gonna understand people saying , \Want to come with ? \ " It sounds incomplete and really bothers me . lol " 
I watch old movies and wonder what on earth must've been going through the minds of the minority actors/actresses who allowed their races to be portrayed as smiling imbeciles . 
Yup , I wish I was about 8 years younger . LOL 
* breathes * Nothing happened to derail starting college . I am in shock . LOL I'm not used to things happening ... at all . >_> 
The neighbors are shooting off fireworks , and it's scaring the cats . They're slinking around the house with eyes bugged out and ears rotating . XD 
SL officially has the worst support system . 
I'm going to become the Post-It < PROPFEMALE > . I guess that's a step up from the Ice < PROPFEMALE > . :P 
My professor sounds like < PROPFEMALE > Deen . LOL 
Er ... I have to interview a psychology professional in a couple of weeks . o.O ; Mamasan ? LOL 
List your 3 favorite colors . And , please do answer because you might get something out of it eventually . ;P 
Hmm ... remember when the tv stations would go off the air and show color bar signals at night ? 
I dreamed that I was friends with < PROPFEMALE > Manson , and he let me borrow his movie theater to cut my mom's hair in it . o.O 
hehe I'm too happy lately . <3 I really don't care either . Now which came first ? LOL 
Sometimes I think the cats believe I am just another piece of furniture for them to jump and climb on . XP 
Two of the best smells : freshly opened coffee and freshly opened peanut butter . : -9 
Cooked lunches > sandwiches 
D: \This is taking forever ! \ " \ 
I forgot my password for my online banking while sick last December and got locked out of my account . I'm just now calling the bank to fix it , 11 months later . LOL 
If I had 46 million dollars , I would not spend it on a rock . Just sayin ' . 
Whee , second week of university . :D 
Just because a person has served in the military , it does not mean they are incapable of wrong doing . I'm proud of our service members , but they are not saints . ( Saw a report about Rangel . :P ) 
loves the ability to hide individual posts . ;) 
:D :D :D :D :D 
Wow , my assignment this week almost makes me wish we lived in a small town again . I had to observe a waiting line of people , and I swear people here do NOT talk to each other . They look so bored and uninvolved . Then I remembered how people were in Crescent ( OK) -- so friendly and talkative . I miss it . :\\ ( Of course , since everyone know everyone , that could also be a pain if you screwed up -- EVERYONE knew about it . XD ) 
It actually feels like Thanksgiving week ... even though the temp is in the 70's all week ! 
ACK ! I forgot to attend the seminar on Sunday night . x_x That makes TWO Option 2's this week . lol 
Hey , what is a [ free ] Windows version of iCal on < PROPMALE > ? and don't suggest Google's calendar . 
Happy Thanksgiving ... I'm so glad this year is so much better than all the previous years . :D And here's to hoping I don't spend most of the day in bed ! x_x 
What's your favorite Thanksgiving dish ? I love the gravy the most ... give it to me in a cup !! 
\It looks like they revived him from the dead so he could get up to sing this song . \ " ~ My mom about the lead singer in Flock of Seagulls ' I Ran So Far Away ' XD " 
HAHAHA Oh boy . I took an assessment for school , and I'm supposed to discuss the top three scores on it ... only I misread and discussed the wrong three scores . XD * ditz moment * :P 
Oh , and I wanted to say * thank you * again to those who replied to the survey . :D 
First batch of beef stew this year . :D Yum ! 
Wah , first poem written in over a year . 
Thank you < PROPFEMALE > Dodd , now I'm craving a salad . lol 
Time is flying by ! 
Wearing my hair in low pigtails , and my dad is calling me ' < PROPFEMALE >.' o.O 
I'm so glad that I haven't seen the Narnia movies because that means my mind hasn't been infected by some Hollywood director's idea of how the story goes ... unlike Lord of the Rings . x_x lol 
We had a class field trip complete with popcorn and magic school buses ... my professor is crazy . LOL 
Mama , please learn to use Google . 95% of what you ask me is on there . XD 
Saw the trailer for < PROPFEMALE > Treader . I was right , my imagination is better . ;) The water girl was disappointing . o.O 
Waking up early because of an upset stomach sucks . Waking up early because of an upset stomach and finding certain emails arrived is awesome ! XD 
Is it wrong that when my parents are out of the house , the first thing I start thinking about is how much cleaning I can get done ? LOL 
LL Bean clothing looks awful . 
made corn chowder . Yum ! 
Life is as hard as you make it out to be . 
I saw Terminator 2 with my dad when it came out -- I was 7 . I remember the pile of skulls at the beginning VERY well . The part where Terminator melted himself down was so sad , that I cried at the theater . XD T-1000 was the stuff nightmares are made of . 
This is the best holiday season ever . :D 
The professor one on of my classes just changed ?? o.O Wait a minute ... this is the pregnant one .. OH ! 
Silk makes chocolate rice milk now ! I can have chocolate milk again . <3 ( Soy kills me and cow's dairy doesn't agree with me either ... ) 
Okay , BOTH of my professors have changed . * confused * 
It may be freezing , but the sun is shining so brightly today . ^_^ 
Filling out Christmas cards is the time to find out your cursive has deteriorated to suckiness . Yup . 
<3 being able to print postage at home . 
Who wants breakfast for supper ?? Bacon , eggs , and grits . ;D 
My goal right now is to finish reading everything I've started reading ... which is several books . XD 
Gotta start working on that interview . x_x 
I am so glad that I grew up with mid-1990's music and earlier . XD 
< PROPFEMALE > Smith , < PROPFEMALE > Dodd , < PROPFEMALE > Evans McDowell , < PROPFEMALE > Tramell your Christmas packages are on the way . :) ( Yes , only you four can see this status . lol ) 
Has anyone watched the Eureka or Warehouse 13 Christmas specials yet ? 
Mmm < PROPMALE > & < PROPFIRST>'s Mudpie ... 
My mom asked me to copy the dvd video from Grandpa's funeral ... I haven't watched it before . Now I see why I get compared to Grandpa . o.o 
So this tax cut < PROPMALE > is actually a tax raise ? Gotta love politics . 
Of course , I have to think about depressing things before going to sleep . 
Starting basic ballet routine = putty legs for the next day . o.O ; 
Pardon the fangirling but : I got tweeted by Ayu . <3 
I think this girl in Vampires Suck is better than < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > . o.O 
waves hello to the hypothyroid supplements . Alas , we meet again , my friends ~ 
You know , I'd go outside for sunshine , but I'm not sure what the point is if I'm wrapped up like an eskimo . 
It's like religion can be an enabler for all the crazies ; it gives them a place to channel their insanity . 
Ugh ! I want to chop off this colored hair , but I'm afraid of looking like a boy . x_x Maybe < PROPFEMALE > length instead ? * sigh * 
I have no clue what I want . Awesome thing since this week is goal setting in one class . /end sarcasm 
You know , if a doctor is so concerned about getting off his shift on time that he tries to make birthing mothers have c-sections , then perhaps he is in the wrong profession . Being a doctor is a sacrifice both for the doctor and his/her family , and anyone who is not willing to listen and do what is best for the PATIENT should do something else . 
\Jesus came so that we might be free from the governments that seek to control us . \ " What ? " 
Breakfast = omelette made with leftover meatloaf . Pretty good ! ( and before you grimace , my mom makes a mean meatloaf . :P ) 
Stargate Universe has been cancelled . Hallelujah ! 
????? Ayumi's new album ! 
Really wish people would learn how to express opinions as opinions and not as fact . Just because you dislike something , it doesn't mean it is crap . YOU just don't like it . And vice versa ... 
LMAO I wonder what Ayu thinks of us tweeting her about listening to the entire album and how good it is , when it doesn't come out until next Wednesday . XD ( Avex leaks it on purpose to AyuChina , but it's still funny ! ) 
Just dropped my phone in water . GREAT ! x_x I wonder if it's like a keyboard where I can wait a few days for it to dry out ... 
<3 for GOOD phone calls and smiling so much that my face hurts . :D 
lol I love psychology , but the way things are phrased at times is sooo silly . Talk like a normal person ! But does that resonate with you ? >_> 
Whee ! Treadmill done .. feels good to be active . 
It's supposed to starting snowing on Christmas Day here . <3 
Matcha = : -x 
Nice to know people can still be ungrateful little beasts during the holidays . 
You know , the only thing I remember about most holidays is how I washed dishes from morning until midnight and maybe ate a little food at some point . -_-; 
I still think cornbread dressing and gravy are the best foods on the holidays . 
It snowed overnight , everything is white outside . :D 
9-1/2 inches of snow ... that is NUTS for here ! 
Ugh , self-imposed torture : making three dishes from leftovers on the day after Christmas . x_x Tastes great though ! 
15 minutes to cranberry scones ... 
It seems so LATE ! 
Just because I use a program , that doesn't mean I know every aspect of it . Sheesh . 
My mom waited 4 days to take down the Christmas tree . It's a record ! ( Usually she takes it down the moment the presents are opened . No , I'm not exaggerating . x_x ) 
It's New Year's < PROPFEMALE > , and we've bought * nothing * for tonight ! o.o I've already been informed I won't be getting champagne (; _ ;) ... but what about everything else ? XD 
What was the best thing that happened to you this year ? And the worst thing ? 
Wow . Almost 2 hours went by and it seems more like 5 minutes . o.o 
Okay , I'm not happy . Apparently the new professors are NOT communicating and my professors think I'm skipping out on the seminars ... Which I'm not . grrr 
Whatcha watching ? 
\Why do we fall sir ? So we might learn to pick ourselves up . \"" 
hehehe Had a little fun with the family relations feature for the Ohana . ;) 
My mom has a virtual cat that meows on SL , and it's upsetting Puff & < PROPFEMALE > . < PROPFEMALE > keeps going to the backdoor to \find\ " the cat . XD " 
It's really disconcerting to not be able to remember so much . Maybe it's better that way . 
Just realized that I have never seen Dirty Dancing .. only bits of it .. Hmmm 
I found a traditional mahjong computer game earlier ... I'm doomed . 
Crappity crap . I hate school breaks because it's hard to get going again . * FOCUS * 
Yesterday's events have me thinking about the Murrah Bombing . It's hard to believe that it's been 15+ years already . I can still remember the bomb blast wind so clearly . x_x People do such cruel things to each other . 
Sometimes I wish I was better at communicating what is in my heart ... Words are so inadequate at times . 
<3 Somewhere Down the Road 
Snow is falling in chunks . o.O 
Noooo ... evil cough , depart from me . >_> 
The more I learn about other people's kids , the more I realize I was one strange child . o.O 
Snow on the ground , beef stew for breakfast . 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > songs are a blast to sing . ;) 
School confusion again . W00T 
* snaps fingers in front of her face * FOCUS ! x_x 
How has everyone been lately ? 
Apparently I can't concentrate for nothing in the daytime . Time for non-decaf tea ... 
With all these movements and such , it just boils down to being loved and accepted for who you are . 
The grocery store taunted me with Mint Chocolate Soy milk , but I resisted . Sigh . 
\So if I go with you to the factory 
Procrastination train stops here . x_x 
One paper down . My goal for today is reached . XD 
Is it really necessary to spell out all the gory details of Representative Gifford's injuries and surgeries on tv ? I don't understand our media sometimes ... okay , much of the time . 
Avocado + raspberry blush vinegar + < PROPFEMALE > = yum . 
So much to do today . ;_; 
Forget the moments that are gone/They don't exist anymore/The moments to come/Will breathe life anew 
Making turkey and bean chili for supper . <3 
What kind of fabric do you think would go with kimono fabric ? >_> Moire ? Trying to see if I can avoid buying more kimono remnants ... 
Uh oh . I've discovered forever21 . x_x 
Can't turn on UB40 because I just can't stop listening to it .... aaahhh <3 
Why doesn't Obama just show his birth certificate already ? What's the big deal ? -_- It's creating even more of an uproar because he won't do such a simple thing . I don't know what to think one way or another , but ... it * does * make it seem like he has something to hide . 
Snow is forecasted for Tuesday and Wednesday . -_- 
Sore/achy . Fatigued . No appetite . noooooo ... 
watched Amelie and loved it . <3 
I have the best friends on earth . 
It has been said that everlasting friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question the friendship . These types of friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been or how faraway they live , and they don't hold grudges . They understand that life is busy , but you will ALWAYS love them ....... Re-post if you have at least 1 of these friends XOXOXOXO 
Mystified as to why people get botox because they pretty much always look better before the injections . o.O It's like a modern Emperor's New Clothes . 
Aaaand watching ' The Good The Bad The Weird ' . Not feeling well = watching too many films . XD 
I dreamed that < PROPFEMALE > Smith , < PROPFEMALE > Watts Brown , and I were at the vet's office . I was explaining the < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE>'s Map of Tasmania song to them ... then I < PROPMALE > out with my best friend from kindergarten and saw a kitten that looked like a tiger . The end . 
Bacon is pork belly ? 
So ... 3 years after buying < PROPMALE > Hayes ' ' This Delicate Thing We've Made ' on iTunes , I finally notice that I never received 3 songs . AND I've been listening to them out of order . Wth ? 
Friend poll : bread with < PROPFEMALE > oil or bread with butter ? ;) 
Fort Bragg is having a blast today -- literally . So many bombs going off . x_x 
I guess I'm having a Supernatural marathon of sorts . XD 
can't sleep , so listening to Tears for Fears & Fine Young Cannibals . XD 
Making new friends and chatting until the wee hours of the morning = FUN ! 
I finally fell asleep and some noisy truck pulls up & honks several times . THANKS A LOT ! 
is endlessly amused by those who think they have the corner on God and insist it is everyone else who is living by \man made rules and ideas . \ " Blind much ? " 
11hrs of sleep . Beautiful . 
I really should not read articles and comments that gripe about Western women . XD 
Aaannd hypothyroid rears its ugly head again . GO AWAY ! 
My current entire iTunes library , atm , has 6,666 files at 106GB . >_> 
Batman > Superman . Yup . 
Meh . -_- 
One more day and second term starts . I'm so bored that I can't wait . lol 
It's funny to get an email from the other side of the globe , and it is dated tomorrow . XD 
I lost 7lb in January . :D 
SPN Season 2 : Done . 
Always nice to find out that not everyone means it when they say \friend\ " . Sigh . "

I would like all of my Facebook friends to comment on this status about how you met me . But I want you to LIE . That's right . Just make it up . After you comment , copy this to your status so I can do the same . 
FINE , I will go to the doctor . Spent the night feeling like I was being strangled and could barely sleep . 
Of course everyone asks me questions on the day I cannot think straight . XD 
Yippy Skippy , trying to write down all of my symptoms . XD I wonder how far back I should go ? >_> And how detailed ? <_<

< PROPMALE > Zerby is drunk as a skunk . 
I uninstalled Firefox and Opera last week , and now Asian text is displaying as square boxes in programs ... not always , but too much . So annoying ... 
Some days are just so tiring , and I wish there was someone I could call my love . 
LOL There are three Melissas , including myself , in the class tonight . x_x 
When I was 11 , and my mom was homeschooling me , she went through this huge < PROPMALE > textbook and covered up all the naked p < PROPMALE > s . Yet , she had me study a first year medical textbook on anatomy where I definitely saw all the naked stuff . LOL Ah , wonderful homeschool anecdotes . 
I found the fatal flaw of < PROPFIRST>'s panic room . There's no bathroom . That's what you get when you build a panic room in a weekend , < PROPFIRST > . < PROPFEMALE > K . Frazer < PROPFEMALE > Smith < PROPFEMALE > Dodd 
My doctor's appointment is on Thursday now . * scowls * 
Looks like I'm going to have to format the laptop . >_< 
I wish hot food didn't give me the hiccups . :( 
I feel awful today , and my mom is < PROPMALE > bitching mode . Can I hide in the closet under a blanket ? x_x 
It's way too early . D: 
Back from the doctor , managed to not pass out during the blood test . XD She said it does sound like the thyroid , but we'll have to wait for the tests to come back . * crosses fingers * 
Google owns Feedburner now ? x_x 
Oh , I forgot to say that I did sneak a peek at the computer screen when the tech was filling out my blood test info ... There were four tests , one was thyroid-something cascade , and the other was thyroid antibodies ( definitely something-antibodies ) . * relieved * XD 
Making garlic shrimp pasta , salad w/balsamic dressing , and some kind of bruschetta type toast for supper . 
STOP REMINDING ME THAT IT IS ALMOST VALENTINE'S DAY ! * ahem *

Saw an elderly woman driving a car with ' jujitsu ' on the license plate . 
Hair dye is toxic to the thyroid ? Nice . Guess that solves my hair dying question . XD 
HA ! My grandmother and all six of her sisters had thyroid issues . Now I have no doubt about whether or not I have it . XD 
I don't want to do any schoolwork . :( Any PP around ? XD 
I should start advertising myself . \Need a big sister ? Little sister ? I'm here to listen and advise ! \ " LMAO " 
I think my eyeballs are going to burn out of my head . x_x 
Test results came back normal . >_< 
You know , I like getting older . 
You drink soda several times a week , and you're worried about the HFCS in a couple of slices of bread ? Seriously ? 
lmao The doctor will leave a voicemail for my dad about my results , but they won't give him the paper copy of the labs . Anyhow , someone is supposed to call me later with the < PROPFIRST > . 
lol < PROPFEMALE > Portman does the best cry faces . 
What puzzles me is my heart rate is anywhere from 77 to 84 lately ( normally 54 ) . Temp can be anywhere from 97.0 to 98.1 , and yea I can tell when it changes from how I feel . XD * nerd moment * 
Oh , today it supposed to be 77 . Hello sunshine , lawn chair , and book . 
OK , new friend list . I've included people I think MIGHT be interested in seeing my health ramblings . If you don't want to see it let me know , and I'll remove you . :) 
I dreamed that my * picture * was on Regis & < PROPFIRST > . Sheesh , I saw that show once at the doctor's office , and now it's stuck in my brain . lol 
Trying out the whole baking soda/acv hair washing again ! I found the solution to the frizzies -- a few drops of < PROPFEMALE > oil shaken up with a cup of water and immediately poured over my hair after the other two steps . Works well . :) I've been using the blow dryer on low instead of letting it dry naturally , so that might help too . 
Well . I think my little no beef/dairy experiment worked . Guess those are permanently gone from my diet . x_x 
I swear , sometimes I am so stupid . * headdesk *

My dad joked that I need to see a doctor because I like drinking plain hot water . Thanks , Daddy . XD 
WoF preacher [ Charles Capps ] on tv . * shudders * 
I had no idea how much butter and beef my mom used until I stopped eating them . Oy . I'm making all or most of my own supper every night . 
Nowadays when I try to get back into exercising , I end up with muscle pain ... not soreness , but pain , especially when those muscles get touched . What's up with that ? 
All happy this morning for no particular reason . <3

I mentioned to a stranger that I was on second life , and he said , \Oh you're one of * them *\" What does that mean ?? XD "

College is teaching me how to live on coffee . I'm sure this skill will be very handy in my career . 
? Hey , you there , who just forces your opinion on someone else saying that you are thinking of him or something with a look that you have done something good just for your self-satisfaction ... However skillfully you may decorate yourself , your real intention is easily seen--haven't you noticed ? ( Ayu - identity ) 
My ipod has been playing since last night . Wonder how that happened ? XD 
GET ON SL , OHANA !

I cannot wait until Obama is out of office . I hope whoever replaces him is better ( ha ! ) . -_- What is this Libya stuff ? I still don't get why we're talking about going there . It is their civil war , let them duke it out . ( Am I missing something ? ) 
Was marveling over how < PROPFEMALE > mp3 players are now . They make my ipod classic look clunky . XD 
Puff has me on notice . He's still pissed from being locked in the car for 3hrs . XD

Registered for the next term . :D College Composition II and Intro to Cognitive Psych 
Both of my parents are okay with me getting on a pill . w00t . Me acting so miserable today probably had something to do with it . XD 
I think my body hates me . x_x 
Baking spoonbread ! 
Freud had some strange ideas . 
Isn't a ' life coach ' just another kind of a therapist/counselor ? ( that may or may not have gone to school for psychology ) 
Whee , I have a gyno appt for April 7 . 
Wait ... Sheryl Swoopes is going to play for the Tulsa Shock ? o.o COOL !

I'm looking forward to the end of this week . It has felt like my brain has been in meltdown mode lately . I haven't been spelling worth a flip . o.O 
I will never be a doctor . Maybe not a health psychologist . Don't put me around blood ! ( Cut myself good and am still struggling to not pass out . x_x ) 
God : when I said I needed pressure to get my work done , that didn't mean wanting the power and dsl to go down . 
I hope nothing else goes wrong today . -_- 
< PROPFIRST > Bleck's show is ending . Hold on , dancing in the street . XD 
My mom made enough rice for an army . O.o 
I'm off to see the wizard ~ ;) 
* girls only * Made it back from the doctor ... It went fine . Nothing spectacular to report other than the pap wasn't bad at all , and I have the prescription . No , I didn't find out why I have pain . I was really nervous , and my main goal was the pills . So < PROPFEMALE > me . XD That's #2 off my goal list for this year . :D
