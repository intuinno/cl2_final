OMFG BOTDF I\M SO ADDICTED ! http://chatter.com/a/h1mvv?ref=nf " 
Blood On The Dance Floor <3 <3 <3 
Idk what to think anymore my mind has offically gone blank . I guess it's me being told HELLO YOUR SUPPOSE TO TAKE IT one step at a time . I guess i've finally been made to see it that way . 
In with the new and out with the old thats how its suppose to be , but how easy is that to do ? 
welll ... School starts wednesday , hard to believe summer is over already . And I was just starting to enjoy it . I really loved my summer , summer hw and all . I got to < PROPFEMALE > out with the best people , got to learn about the best things , got to lose some more weight ( which i'm still doing ) , and I got to make more and build other friendships . What more could you ask for out of summer ? I missed you all ! 
=/ Waking up @ 5am tomorrow what a sad sad thng . I think my goal this year is to see lifehouse i concert . 
Going to a baseball game on Monday Braves vs . Pirates . Hm ..... Lets ... go ... Pirates ??? Hehe . Canfield fair sometime this weekend . AND CHILDRENS MIRACLE NETWORK BAKE SALE @ LOVE'S IN HUBBARD . Come help benefit less fortune it kids . 
Attention FB even if you hate me and you'll do nothing else nice to me in your entire life please check out my events . And please come to one of them . This < PROPFEMALE > that i'm doing events for . Is really important to me . I'm asking please if you never do anything for me ever again . Please help me help the kids that can't live normally on their own . 
Never gonna get me down . Idc what you think about me . So go ahead and keep trying . I love myself just the way I am . You can try and knock me down . Cause the only peoples oppionons that matter is mine and gods . So just to let you know , don't waste your breathe on knocking me down . Use your breathe on saving yourself . 
Lolz New Addiction Fireflight <3 Bet you don't know the genre of that , inless you have something in common with me . =) 
=) Jesus loves me this I know for the bible tells me so . I'm loved more than enough . I am loved by god , my family , and all my friends . So haters keep talking you make my smile . 
<3 I wonder if he even realizes that i've liked him since i met him . =) . Even If i never have a < PROPMALE > with him . I know he's worth liking he's such an amazing guy . Whoever steals his heart is really lucky , to get one of the only full hearted guys out there . At Least I can say he's my friend , and he makes me smile . =) <3 
Can I have advice ?? How do you tell a friend you like like them when your afraid they will reject you ?? I don't care if he rejects liking me back , but i'm scared telling him will ruin the friendship but not telling him is making my heart hurt . What and how should i do it ? 
I'll just be another mystery that nobody wants to solve . One of those books on a shelf with dust everywhere . I'll just be another story to laugh at , that you once heard of but never read . I'll just be that picture in the closet with pen marks . I'll just be the one you'll never see . As long as you know , that I'm me 
HEY YOU !!! If you havn't figured it out ! It's you I like . It's you . =) I know you probably don't like me back . But now you have it . I LIKE YOU ! there , he knows its him and no one else does . HAHA ! I really like you =) If you don't like me back we will just pretend i didn't say it . 
There's a girl walkin ' in these shoes\ 
And she knows that everything she's got is all she's got to lose\ 
There's a dream right behind these eyes\ 
And she finds a reason to be strong\ 
With every tear she dries\ 
Tryin ' hard to fight the way things are\ 
So she leaves her world behind\ 
When the sound of doubt is turned up so loud\ 
She turns the music up inside 
Theres no such thing as a great guy . Never will be cause they all lie . Anyway . NEW BIO ! tis my heart . =) 
i'd rather get hurt then lied to . So if your gonna pretend to be nice but your lying , just hurt me okay ? I've seen pain I can handle it . NEW BIO CHECK IT OUT . Its my <3 in lyrics 
the mysteries in life are way way way out there . Like further than pluto out there . Like we will never fully catch them . 
DUDE ! How can I wanna cry and smile at the same time ? It's like the reason i'm crying is the same reason i'm smiling . 
Why does everyone see this boring book when they look at its cover . If you took the time to see , the real me . You'd find i'm amazing . I'm crazy . I'm smart . a lots of things . But you'll never see 
Well .. Who says life doesn't fast foward and rewind ? We do it all the time . We move past things and move on . We regress and things stay with us making us hurt . The only way to move forward without moving to fast is to process the past , then let go . No need to let what you can't change keep you from moving foward , and never let tommorrow keep you from living today . =) 
No need to let what you can't change keep you from moving foward , and never let tommorrow keep you from living today . =) Today is as important as tommorrow . You can't fix yesterday , but you can't make tommorrow better . <3 
No need to let what you can't change keep you from moving foward , and never let tommorrow keep you from living today . =) Today is as important as tommorrow . You can't fix yesterday , but you can't make tommorrow better . ? 
Maybe tommorrow my wish on a < PROPFEMALE > will come true ?? I had a good day . Got lots of hugs . =) I love hugs , make me smile . 
I'm so tired of a one sided friendship were i give and give And I get nothing back but pain , and feeling used I guess this is where being nice to everyone because its the right thing Gets hard I <3 God If my pain is his gain I can deal with it considering he will take all my pain away one day . One day That I'm longing for with every breath and every smile when inside my heart breaks . I'm waiting for one day One 
God , please help me forgive the ones who hurt me and the ones I love . Help me know what to do when all I can do is count on you . How do I smile when my heart aches ? Help me to let go of the pain . Help me be able to be arround the ones who cause it without feeling it come back . Forgive me for asking so selfishly . I don't know what I do if you were never there to < PROPFEMALE > on . Thank you . Amen . 
I can't believe i thought you were different you never were . 
I guess theres a way to be so smart and so nice . And to still be so stupid and mean . How can I be so smart , and think that someone could be different . And how can i be so nice and on the inside i'm yelling at myself really harshly . I guess I just got to ignore everything but the things i need to succeed in life . Cause other than that I'll get hurt . And i don't want to . So there , I'm done . No more pain ... I hope 
Everybody's nobody . I guess invisiblity has its puposes , you don't get to cocky , and people hating you doesn't hurt . <3 I'm the outcast that doesn't want to fit in . So quit trying . Just cause your talking about me , or hating me . It's not changing my heart . So if you wanna waste your time go ahead . While your doing that I'll be enjoying my life , okay ?? 
Sometimes when your heart tells you something you gotta forget about it . Even if know matter what you do your heart just keeps screaming louder . 
wake up to a < PROPFEMALE > day and i know its gonna be okay . Don ; t have to worry about history ... http://chatter.com/a/ln04a?ref=nf 
Happy like sunshine ~ =) ~ . I'm addicted to Only One In Color- Trapt <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 . History and Biology h.w YAY !!!!..... no hehe . BTW BTW ! Read a bible judgemental people . Gosh . Did you know judging someone is a sin . Gossips a sin too . Talking about peoples personal business is a sin . So stop spreading stuff thats not yours to share . 
One day I'll turn around , I'll see your hand reach out\ 
I'm only fooling myself , oh\ 
But maybe when you smile\ 
It means you'd stay awhile\ 
Just maybe you'd save me now

I just keeing going through this life . Through all the ups and downs that are thron at me .. and I keep wondering .. you know maybe it's a good thing I don't completely fit in on earth .. cause one day I'ma be where i'm suppose to be .. heaven 
How do I say something I can't even put into words . Or when I do put into words it doesn't come out . Or when they almost come out I forget them ... thats what happens every time ... maybe fate wants me to struggle to express to you what I wanna say .. I wish you could just tell me instead ... gosh =/ 
Well .. again not much to say anymore ... I really just have nothing there ... 
I'm Invisible . I'm insignficant . I'm unimportant . I'm unwanted . I'm hated . I'm smart . I'm creative . I'm misjudged . I'm very unique . I'm optimitic . I'm over weight . I'm dieting . I'm learning . I'm growing up . I'm moving on . I'm dreaming my life away . I'm aiming to high . I'm to random . I'm to energetic . At times , I'm to negative . But you know what .... I'm ME ! And I love who I am even if you don't . <3

Sometimes I wonder if normal should be takin outta the dictionary cause honestly is anyone or anything ever normal ?? 
Girl like boy . Girl wonders if boy likes her . Girl never takes a < PROPMALE > and asks . How many times does that happen in life ??? To much ... Some girls miss out on really great guys . And some guy is too stupid to make his answer more clear in the first place . Haha 
Sometimes you get a reason that makes being yourself the best thin in the world 
Girl likes boy .
