can't wait for the weekend ! Going to Cape with < PROPFIRST > , < PROPMALE > & < PROPFEMALE > . Is the \Pony\ " in my future ??? Don't know ... ask < PROPFEMALE > . lol " 
Well today , I would have liked to sleep in , but duty called & I had to go to work . If only I could be < PROPMALE > ..... 
Have you ever had a day when everything was right ?? That's how I feel today ! 
has a busy weekend planned . Friday night , going to < PROPMALE>'s to watch the Cardinals/Cubs game . Saturday , playing in a golf tournament during the morning . Going four-wheeler riding with < PROPFEMALE > & < PROPMALE > Saturday afternoon . Whew !!! I'm already tired ! lol 
and cornbread too 
Is Friday here yet ??? 
Looking forward to tonight ! 
Blah .... 
could someone please turn up the heat ??? I'm cold ! 
Started taking this medication to quit smoking about 3 days ago . I'm suppose to smoke like normal for 2 weeks and then quit . Now , every cigarette I smoke tastes and smells like crap . I guess that means it's working ! 
Another day at work .... wishing it was the weekend already ! Feeling down today . Guess it's the weather . Rain , rain , go away ! 
I haven't smoked a cigarette yet ! It's been 14 hours exactly . 
I've been smoke-free for 3 days !!! 
Nothing to report ... just another day at work . 
feeling restless today ... want to go somewhere . 
Congratulations < PROPFIRST > !!! I'm really proud of you ! 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas to all my family & friends ! Love every one of you ! 
You wouldn't believe the problems we've had ! First , couldn't connect to the Internet . Now , we can connect on the desktop ( not the laptop ) . Laptop needs a different verson of software . Then , can't get on FarmTown cause the browser needed updating . I updated the browser . Now , the desktop doesn't have enough RAM to support FarmTown ! Getting that solved Monday . Whew ... can't catch a break ! 
< PROPFIRST > had a great Christmas ! Spent the day at mom's house with Aunt < PROPFEMALE > & Uncle < PROPMALE > . Played Yatzee & Battleship , opened presents , had a great dinner , took a nice long nap with < PROPFIRST > . 
Okay ... I was going for medium brown hair , but I got black . I guess I'll try it for awhile , and then decide . lol 
Had a great time tonight with great people ! Happy New Years everyone ! 
It's been a verrrrry lazy day today . I plan on accomplishing a lot more tomorrow ! 
It's going to snow !!! Finally ! I've been promising < PROPFIRST > we'd build a snowman . 
I'm hoping that all my friends at Tri-County are safe , and no one got hurt after today's events . Just know that all of you are in my thoughts . 
Took a short trip outside today , but was really dissapointed the snow was the flakey kind . Really wanted to build a snowman ! < PROPFIRST > had to settle for sledding down the little hill behind our yard . It was fun , but we need MORE snow ! 
Well ... don't laugh , but I just got through my first dance lesson tonight . I learned the Waltz and some of the Swing . Most of you know , I normally have two left feet and no rhythm ... but I think I did okay tonight . I didn't fall on my ass or crush anyone's toes at least . lol 
EVERYWHERE N MESSY AND WET

Love you babe ! :-) " 
It seems like I get sick during every holiday . 
I can't believe my baby is turning 9 years old on Friday ! It seems like just a few years ago we were bringing him home from the hospital . He was 7lbs , 9oz , and now he is almost up to my shoulders . I wish I could keep him little ! 
I'm discovering I'm so much like my mom ! We went to Cape today to buy some birthday presents for < PROPFIRST > . Got separated in Walmart . I paged her , but still couldn't find her ! Called her cell phone , but she didn't answer . Finally found each other in the parking lot . Discovered we'd both bought birthday cakes .

Okay , as some of you might know , < PROPFIRST > got shingles while we were on vacation . His meds cost $213 ! The lady at the pharmacy even apologized because it was so expensive . So , 2 weeks later , he's still not better . He tells the doctor . So , what does the doctor do ? He prescribes him meds that cost $3.50 !! WTH !!! You'd think between the doctor/pharmacist someone would have done that in the first place ! 
Playing cards , grilling hamburgers and drinking strawberry daiquiris . 
I couldn't sleep for anything last night ... up til 4:30 am . But ... I did get the laundry , dishes and kitchen cleaned up . Feel like crap right now though .

Let's see how creative my Facebook friends are ... Leave me a 1-word comment that best describes me using the THIRD letter of YOUR FIRST Name ... It can only be 1 word ... Then copy and paste this to your wall so I can leave a word about you ... Don't just post a word & not copy , that's no fun !

“Your time is limited , so don't waste it living someone else's life . Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking . Don't let the noise of other's opinions drown out your own inner voice . And most important , have the courage to follow your heart and intuition . They somehow already know what you truly want to become . Everything else is secondary . 
So tired after this day ! 
As the storms roll in Lineman all over are packing their bags , lacing up their boots , & kissing their families goodbye . They work all day & into the night without a break , its cold , wet & exhausted but they keep going b/c they have a job to do . So please keep these men in your prayers & remember that they are out there trying to restore and keep the power on for your families ? Got Power ?? Thank A Lineman ? 
It's so cold outside , I've seen a few gangsters walking around with their pants pulled up . 
Congrats to the Packers ! That was a great game !!! 
There are many things worse than turning 40 . Like , for example \ 
1 . Being eaten by wolves\ 
2 . Getting your leg caught in a meat grinder\ 
3 . Poking your eye out\ 
4 . Running over a baby < PROPFEMALE > or duckling\ 
5 . Finding a finger in your soup\ 
6 . Irritable Bowel Syndrome\ 
7 . Losing the winning lottery ticket\ 
8 . Mullets\ 
9 . Being chewed up by hamsters , rats or cats\ 
10 . Bed bugs 
Four A's and 2 B's!!! I'm so proud of you < PROPFIRST > ! 
Great bonfire last night ! 
Had a great time at the Crawfish Boil Saturday night ! 
Last night = Scary 
I think I was on an emotional roller coaster yesterday ... sad , happy , jealous , excited , aroused , angry and everything in between . Today ... I'm back to normal ! I really need to get this bi-polar situation under control ... LOL 
floods and tornado warnings .. so sick of this ! I'm ready for the blue , cloudless skies of summer ! 
still no power here 
It takes 7 seconds for food to pass from mouth to stomach . A human hair can hold 3kg . The length of the penis is 3x the length of the thumb . The femur is as hard as concrete . A woman's heart beats faster then a man's . Women blink 2x as much as men . We use 300 muscles just to keep our balance when we stand . A woman has read this entire post . The man is still looking at his thumb . Re-post if this made you laugh . :D 
Had a great weekend even though I stopped smoking 4 days ago ! I think I can do it this time and stop for good ! Also ... I found my cell phone and glasses today after a whole week of not having them ! Things are looking up .... LOL . 
Woman's Ass Size study ... There is a new study about women and how they feel about their ass's . The results were pretty interesting . 30% of women think their ass is too fat . 10% of women think their ass is too skinny . The remaining 60% say they don't care , they love him , he's a good man and wouldn't trade him for the world .. Re-post if you want to make another woman laugh today : ) 
< PROPFIRST > & me having a good time at Cape Splash today 
It's great to finally be home ! 
Thank you < PROPMALE > & < PROPFEMALE > for an awesome week ! Good friends & good times !!! 
So bored ... 
I loved you the minute I heard you were coming . I loved you the second you were born . Then , I saw your face and fell in love some more . You were only a minute old , but I knew I would die for you and to this day I still would . When you choose to have a child , you make a conscious decision to allow your heart to walk around outside of your body . Put this on your status if you have children you love more than life . 
Whew ... it's way to early for me to be this wide awake & alert ! 
Up at 5:00 am and getting stuff done today ! In a great mood !
