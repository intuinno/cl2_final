Getting ready to CRUISE next week !! 

still getting ready for the cruise ! 
Having < PROPFEMALE > help with Facebook 
Back from the cruise , looking forward to Vegas in 3 weeks ! 
Trying to talk < PROPFEMALE > into going to Dollywood today . 
took < PROPFEMALE > to the orthopedist today , her foot is \crushed\ " in addition to the broken big toe . He put it in a cast and put her on bedrest for at least a week . I'm glad to finally know what is causing so much pain . " 
< PROPFEMALE > is back in school after missing 3 weeks on her gimpy foot ... cast is off and everything ! I never thought I would survive it , but I did ! I do miss her company , though 
camping in < PROPFEMALE > valley .... awesome !! 
I am so angry ! Some a-hole tourist in the National Park lured a bear cub close to him so that he could take a photo of it .... cub got scared and bit him ( very minor bite ) .... now they are going to euthanize a 60 lb cubby ... I wish I could find the tourist , I would give him a bite to remember ! Why can't we treat our animals properly ? 
getting ready to go camping for a few days in NC ...... Love it ! 
ahhh ..... camping by the river reading a funny book .... great day ! 
camping in the rain , getting ready to nap with Luc E Furr ... 
in Atlanta for Fathers Day with Daddy 
back from ATL visiting my 90 yr old father ... getting old can really , really suck . 
Being crazy is harder than it looks . 
teenage boys and teenage girls belong on different planets until they are smarter . 
camping with the dogs at a campground just for dogs . Tons of stuff to do , agility , swimming , other dogs to play with .... what are my dogs doing ? Why , they are sleeping in the air conditioned camper !! This is their first and last camping trip !! 
so over the dog days of summer .... c'mon FALL ! 
In response to Christina ...... ME TOO !!! and get your DL !! 
non pet owners who visit and like to complain about my pets : 1 ) They live \ 
here . You don't . 2 ) If you don't want their hair on your clothes , stay \ 
off the furniture . That's why they call it ' fur'niture . 3 ) I like my pets\ 
a lot better than I like most people . 4 ) To you , they are animals . To \ 
...... me , they are my babies who are short , hairy , walk on all fours and don't\ 
complain ! 
Is it necessary for one to be a sadist ini order to be a physician ? 
Back from vacation in FL , camping in NC and my father's funeral in ATL over the past weekend ... C4 back in school for her Jr year in HS ... have decided to move back to ATL after she graduates .... I miss home . 
< PROPFEMALE > is on the mend and back in school ! Now if my pneumonia + will clear up things will get back to normal , whatever that is !

Roll f'ing TIDE !! My eldest son gave me ' Bama and 7 .... I am counting his money already ! 
Dammit Bama ! Don't give this one away ! 
Shit !!!!!!!! 
My man McElroy is officially on queer street ... Has no idea who or where he is .... can you say concussion ? 
< PROPFEMALE > is back in a cast .... orthopedist thinks he's solved the mystery ! A month in a cast , then physical therapy ... finally there is hope for a resolution ! 
Wishing your mother Happy Birthday on Facebook is very nice , but it does NOT take the place of a phone call .... This is directed to the two of my sons who have not YET called ... there is still time to redeem yourselves ! 
Thanks so much for the warm birthday greetings , everyone . You all really made me feel special ! It was a great day . 54 is off to a good start ! 
Fresh batch of black and white cookies ! Come and get ' em before < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE > eat all of them !

Ahhh .... yet another snow day for Sevier County schools ... fire in hearth , soup in crock pot , loaf of bread in oven , hot cocoa simmering on the stove .... the only missing element ? Why SNOW , of course ! 
Cornmeal pancakes with < PROPFEMALE > pecan butter , pretty yummy ! 
Warm banana bread spread with Plugra .... Orange cardomom cookies with citrus frosting in the making ....
