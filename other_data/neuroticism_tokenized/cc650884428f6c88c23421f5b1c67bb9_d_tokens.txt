I believe in Jesus Christ and have accepted him as my personal Savior . One facebooker has challenged all believers to put this on their wall . In the Bible it says , if you deny me in front of your peers , I will deny you in front of my Father at the gates of Heaven . This is simple ... if you Love God and you are not afraid to show it , repost this . Just copy and paste ... No shame here !!!
