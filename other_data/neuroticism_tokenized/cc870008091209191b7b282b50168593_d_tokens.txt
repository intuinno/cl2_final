And even as I wonder , I'm keeping you in sight . \ 
You're a candle in the window , on a cold dark winter's night ??? \ 
-I love that song . 
Food for Thought .... \ 
If you always do what you did ; you'll always get what you got . 
Wants it to be marching season already . 
??? Her face is a map of the world , is a map of the wooorld . \ 
You can see she's a beautiful girl , she's a beautiful gi-irl . \ 
and everything around her is a silver pool of light , and people who surround her feel the benefit of it .....??? \

An unemployed jester is nobody's fool . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Donaldson , Rebeccah Loserfacee , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , and < PROPFEMALE > Davidson had better be ready to give me some BEASTLY hugs . 
Off to camp . Be jealous . See everyone in a week ... but until then ... I LOVE YOU ! 
Feels like crying , but is happy to be home . 
I feel it is neccessary to write a status containing nothing but randomness and unneeded nonsense . It is because of this that every year , lepurcauns eat purple dinosaurs rather than horseshoe shaped marshmallows . 
Dispicable Me is a GREAT movie . 
Has nothing to say at the moment . 
??? Lord knows that I'm not perfect , but I sure do try ??? \ 
Oakleigh ? ' s Rascal Flatts 
Wishes she could/could have go somewhere interesting this summer .

YES ! 2 weeks till marching season :D <- that is my excited face . 
SAT camp today , my summer is officially over .
