I need to be with myself and center clarity .... peace ... and serenity .

It's killing me to know that my resplendent new iphone 4 is just sitting on a mail truck somewhere in Poplar Bluff . I'm sure it's cold and lonely !! My mail doesn't come until 3:30 - 4:00 .... and so the wait begins . I'm also hoping that my class is canceled tonight , so we can get better acquainted ! Cross your fingers for me ! 
Is in iPhone ecstasy !!!!!!! :) 
Just found 20 bucks in walmart parking lot ... I think i'll play the lottery with it . If i win , I'm going to pay it forward by randomly dropping a 20 back into the parking lot ! 
Is watching movies and eating pizza with one of my most favorite people in the whole world ! What an amazing way to spend saturday night !!!

It's 10AM and this is my day so far : Woke up late to find that I left the crock pot on high instead of low . Burnt lunch . Walked outside , flat tire . I was low on gas .. I ran out directly across from the gas station . Finally made it to work , left my lights on . Dead car . All I can do now is laugh about it and thank the people in my life that are always there to hold that big umbrella over my head while it's pouring ! :)
