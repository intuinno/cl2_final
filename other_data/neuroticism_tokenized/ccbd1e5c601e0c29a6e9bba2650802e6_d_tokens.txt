< PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > and God high-fived once , it is now known as the Big Bang . 
Have you ever thought that vegetarians maliciously starve animals by competing with them for the same food ? 
I want to go to Japan to compete on ninja warrior 
Why did warrior dash have to be in Lake Elsinore and close registration before I knew about it ?!?!!! :( 
People are saying Obama cancelled the national day of prayer , he didn't . He just cancelled the White House service that recognizes it . 
Holy Crap , Prom 
Prom was amazing :) Turns out I was one of the 8% who didn't get laid 
The dentist's office give me the creeps 
iron man 2 was amazing . I almost forgot what being in a movie theater felt like

Hates how his summers always start out spectacular and then start to suck because all his friends go on vacation . 
is going to pole position to meet some random famous people so his friends will be jealous of him . 
2 days until my birthday :D ! 
I'm now an adult , i have power ! 
I survived 
Once we set through , we might not be able to come back . We may never see our parents again . There's no turning back . But this may be our only < PROPMALE > . We can't let fear stop us ! I'm not afraid of the darkness ! 
Thinking of you , wherever you are . We pray for our sorrows to end , and hope that our hearts will blend . Now I will step forward to realize this wish . And who knows : starting a new journey may not be so hard , or maybe it has already begun . There are many worlds , and they share the same sky - one sky , one < PROPFEMALE > . 
hasn't seen his girlfriend in forever 
18 days ... 
My light has left me in the abyss of life . It just kicked off and drifted away while I was asleep . I don't want to sit here and wait for it to return so I look go look around . I search for days and days but to no avail . I can't find it . My life has turned into an empty void surrounded by darkness plunging deeper and deeper into sorrow and dispair . I need my light back . 
I'm going to drive for 5,000 < PROPMALE > . The drive is going to suck , but the rewards should be great 
There is only one race in Utah . CAUCASIAN o.O 
DON\T EVER GO EAST . EVER ! mosquitoes suck > : l " 
I have an oven with a ' stop time ' button . It's probably meant to be ' stop timer ' but I don't touch it , just in case . 
If women ruled the world there would be no wars . Just a bunch of jealous countries not talking to each other . 
A blond texts a brunette ' What does IDK mean ' the brunette replies ' I Don't Know ' then the blond replies : ' No one seems to know '

New Friends are Always a Treat ^.^ 
Going wakeboarding at 6:30 am :D 
Hungry :s 
There is no substitute to a Western Bacon Cheeseburger . 
Today I finally got up on a wakeboard . It was an amazing experience for me until I smacked the water at the equivalent < PROPFEMALE > of a belly flop at 25 mph . The Impact was so hard that all my nerve endings went numb in my face and arms and I still have a headache 12 hours later . 
Sunburn O.O 
I want to do something different , visit someplace extraordinary , pick up a new talent . Something to take me away from my regular schedule 
Get out the quads , dirtbikes , and ATV's . I'm going to the hills

Food :) 
Cheddar Goldfish . They don't sound too appetizing at first , but once you start eating them its hard to stop . 
Just took my girl out to a fancy restaurant that plays jazz music in San < PROPMALE > . We ended up getting lost in the midst of all the one way streets , but we ended up finding the harbor and this huge military ship stockpiled with airplanes and helicopters on top . Needless to say today was pretty awesome :) 
Okay , I've been playing way too much black ops . Today as I was putting on my deodorant I thought to myself target neutralized ^.^ 
About a month ago I was on the phone and needed to write down someone else's phone number . I grabbed the first available sheet I could find and after i wrote it down , i stuffed it in my drawers . Approximately 2 months later I take it out and actually look at what the papers are . They were my sisters late homework passes for school XD ( no excuses for you )
