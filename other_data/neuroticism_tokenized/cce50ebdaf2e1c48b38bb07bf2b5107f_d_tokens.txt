I , Pencil , simple though I appear to be , merit your wonder and awe , a claim I shall attempt to prove . In fact , if you can understand me—no , that's too much to ask of anyone—if you can become aware of the miraculousness which I symbolize , you can help save the freedom mankind is so unhappily losing . I have a profound lesson to teach .... not a single person on the face of this earth knows how to make me . 
it's true of homecoming , but not of prom it's true of undertow , but not of rip current it's true of margin of error , but not of sampling error

A few years ago , I \ 
was moving a new bed into my apartment , and this woman who lived in \ 
the building opened the front door for me with her key . She said , ' I'm \ 
not worried because a rapist wouldn't have a bed like that . ' That's how \ 
she started the conversation . Now , what I should have said was nothing . \ 
What I did say was ' You'd be surprised . '
