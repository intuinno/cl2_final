Please put this on your status if you know , or are related to someone killed on Alderaan when it was obliterated by the Death < PROPFEMALE > . My wish is that people will understand that the Empire is a band of murdering scum . The Rebel Alliance wants only to bring peace to the galaxy , but the evil Empire continues to kill innocent civilians . 93% won't copy/paste this . Will YOU make this your status for at least one hour ? 
I love spring time . sigh ^_^ 
While you SCREAM at your woman , there's a man wishing he could talk softly to her ear ... While you HUMILIATE , OFFEND and INSULT her , there's a man flirting with her and reminding her how wonderful she is . While you HURT your woman , there's a man wishing he could make love to her . While you make your women CRY there's a man stealing smiles from her ... Post this on your wall if you're against Domestic Violence ...

Life is interesting stuff . \ 
One minute your on cloud nine the next in hell , you look upon a beautiful vista and smell a skunk , hear about a man shot to death in New York then you see a man beating someone . What would you have done ? The world is in a state of content motion , it waits not . To have loved and lost is the true blessing , to be blind to love is the true crime . 
...... must go to the library and study . Sigh ...... I wish it didn't have to be like this but I guess it's my own dam fault . ( and yes I spelt it that way on purpose . ) 
Is listening to \Bad Romance\ " by Lady Gaga ^_^ I Soooo love this song ! "
