A true friend doesn't care if your house is untidy , your car makes funny noises , if you only have $5.00 in the bank this week , or that your family is not perfect ... they love you for who you are . True friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question their friendship . REPOST if you are lucky enough to have at least one true friend .
