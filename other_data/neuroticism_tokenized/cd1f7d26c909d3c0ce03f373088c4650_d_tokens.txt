oh my god , today was amazing . for those of you who did not go to 3rd and lindsley after graduation to hear the wooten brothers ( i.e. everyone but me and < PROPFIRST > ) , i dont believe words can describe what you missed . however , i will give you the highlights . after the band warmed up ( around 9:30 or 10 ) , they played a few jazzy songs , most notably september . 
woke up yesterday a hume-fogg blue knight . woke up today a richmond spider . heading to richmond now ; see all you guys later ! ill miss you ! 
so , after an epic 14 hour drive , a ridiculous trek across campus and back several times , and the unpacking of many , many things , i am officially moved in at Richmond ! hooray ! :) 
well , research starts tomorrow . maybe ill actually sleep tonight ! nah , probably not . 
He's a real Nowhere Man , \ 
Sitting in his Nowhere Land , \ 
Making all his nowhere rules for nobody , \

Knows not where he's going to , \ 
Isn't he a bit like you and me ? 
hey , who remembers the name of the theorem that says that AROC over [ a , b ] is equal to IROC at a point ( x0 , y0 ) , a </= x0 </= b ?

And the waitress is practicing politics\

Yes , they’re sharing a drink they call loneliness\ 
But it’s better than drinkin’ alone

so , rush : beyond the lighted stage was an incredible documentary about , in my opinion ( any many other people's ) , the greatest band ever . if you've never heard of them , now you have . if you did not see the movie , it is coming out on june 29th on dvd , and i will be happy to < PROPFEMALE > you my copy . if you did , you can attest to rush's incredible awesomeness , and i praise thee most highly . 
If the future's looking dark , We're the ones who have to shine\ 
If there's no one in control , We're the ones who draw the line\ 
Though we live in trying times , We're the ones who have to try\ 
\ 
Though we know that time has wings , \ 
We're the ones who have to fly .

\To seek the sacred river Alph 
And the sun shines down all on the ground , And the grass is oh so green , \ 
And my heart is still , and I've got the will , And I don't really feel so mean . \ 
Here it comes , here it comes , here it comes right now , And it comes right in on time , \ 
Well it eases me , and it pleases me , And it satisfies my mind 
Well it shines so bright , and it gives so much light , \ 
And it comes from the sky above . \ 
Makes me feel so free , makes me feel like me , \ 
And lights my life with love .

Well some say life will beat you down , \ 
Break your heart , steal your crown . \ 
So I've started out for God knows where , \ 
I guess I'll know when I get there . 
Yes , there are two paths you can go by , but in the long run\ 
There's still time to change the road you're on 
sunburns : very not fun\ 
time with family : totally worth it 
He had a thousand ideas ; you might have heard his name . \ 
He lived alone with his vision Not looking for fortune or fame . \ 
Never said too much to speak of ; He was off on another plane . \ 
The words that he said were a mystery ; Nobody's sure he was sane . \ 
But he knew , he knew more than me or you , No one could see his view , Oh where was he going to

The good book says it's better to give than to receive , \ 
I do my best to do my part , \ 
Nothing in my pockets , I've got nothing up my sleeve , \ 
I keep my magic in my heart . 
You may say I'm a dreamer , \ 
But I'm not the only one . \ 
I hope someday you'll join us\ 
And the world will live as one . 
I can hear your heartbeat for a thousand miles , \ 
and the heavens open every time you smile . \ 
You are my strong tower\ 
a shelter over me ... \ 
a fortress when I'm weak . \ 
Fill my heart with gladness\ 
Take away my sadness\ 
Ease my troubles , that's what you do .

i was incorrect earlier . i luckily managed to make it to the InterVarsity Fall Retreat ( though i was late ) , and it was one of the most amazing experiences of my life . thanks to all of you who helped to make it happen . :) 
how do InterVarsity people consistently manage to turn the most ordinary , boring nights into such a fun and exciting time ?
