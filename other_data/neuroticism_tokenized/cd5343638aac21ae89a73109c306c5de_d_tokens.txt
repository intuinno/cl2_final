I'll be on all night and at the start of the new year ! Just sayin ' ... 

The wonderful thing about fireworks displays is that the ending of them is always big , flashy , and most of all , loud . Happy freaking New Year everyone ! 
Sitting in the dark , I can't forget . Even now I realize the time I'll never get . Another story of the bitter pills of fate . I can't go back again . I can't go back again , but you asked me to love you and I did . Traded my emotions for a contract to commit , and when I got away I only got so far . The other me is dead . I hear his voice inside my head . 
What in the world have I gotten myself into ? I go to play Legend of < PROPFEMALE > - A Link to the Past and I have like ALL my friends at once . I find this to be rather amusing . Social networking is one of the funniest things humans have created ! Supreme LOL ! 
My word . There is a conspiracy going on here . This whole social networking deal . It's dragging me in . No it's not . Come on . Does anybody that know really think I could be enveloped by this thing we all call Facebook ? I don't! 
I'm trolling as a freaking Dragon-type GOD POKEMON ! You mad ? 
Mudkip ! MUDKIP ! I'M SURROUNDED BY MUDKIP !!!!!!!!!! 
Before the day officially ends : HAPPY BIRTHDAY OZZY OSBOURNE !!!!!!!!!!!!! 
What a way to spend your day . Disliking the football week and not getting the football wins I seek . ( rhyme intentional ) 
The god Pokemon Arceus is ready for Christmas ! 
I think that if we were to try to design a family tree we be suffocating in paper and graphite/ink . We gotta be the biggest freaking family in the world that also makes no sense whatsoever ! 
In Soviet Russia , this joke overuses you ! 
I would just like to wish < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Hysell and < PROPFEMALE > Wynne Streetman a very happy birthday !

Check out my DKC2 video for some nostalgia ! 
Feelin ' like crap on the inside just as always plus feelin ' the hunger of not eating lunch yet . Let's go fix the lunch problem . 
Took care of the hunger but not the life I'm hating . FML 
The Pink Panther cartoons are so classic 60's it's not even funny ( BUT IT IS ! ) 
I feel so , so , Christmas-type right now ... 
I hope everyone had a wonderful Christmas . I finally got a new pair of BLACK boots ! I really wanted them too ! 
So close to the profile picture change , man . It's so close ...

I feel like I'm in a place where nothing can bring me down . It's feels kind of ... strange to me ... It's a good strange ... kind of like while opening your Christmas present and before you officially open it you put the bow on your head ... I don't know ! I just feel kind of ... calm and tranquil ... feels nice ... 
All I need to remember is that it didn't happen . 
Will some one PLEASE get Heaven Long to accept my friend request ?! 
Good night then social networking site and all of the people that are on it whom I call my friends that I know in real life and that I wish they could all live on the better end of life all the time and leave myself to fend off the evils of the world if I had my way just to protect you all from any harm that said evil may cause you .

Oh yeah . I know I'm sick . I'm going to bed at 8:40 PM ! Night , then . 
Making me sick was pretty cruel of whatever it was that did it . I have however offset that cruelty with some good things to say . May everyone have a good healthy day as I heal under mine covers . Lots of love to everyone ! XD 
When the illness fades , the boy plays ! Hallelujah ! I feel like I could conquer the world ! * cough * * cough * Maybe in a couple more days to get rid of THAT .

What really irritates me is your constant decision to use me as a tool to get back at each other during YOUR disagreements . I love you both , but you need to learn that I am human who knows that maturity is NOT age-based . You maybe older than I am . However , I am far beyond your level of maturity . When will parents learn ? 
I'm pretty sure Coach Murphy would understand it if I couldn't do a work-out full on due to my obscene coughing and lack of ability to breathe through my nose .

Holy cow ! My thumb is going to look so bad ... At least I already had a callas there to prevent blistering ! Or maybe not ... 
I don't like what I've become ... I hear the voices of my friends and they haven't changed at all . Then I reflect on mine , and ... I feel like a different person ... a person I know I cannot like . And if I can't like him , I know other people can't like him ... If you object to my opinion , please say so ... I could use a good correction right about now ... 
Tetris makes me feel better . Except when I'm angry . NEVER PLAY TETRIS ANGRY ! OR DRINK OR DRIVE . Bad ideas those ...

And on top of that cause me to acquire a very aggravating and painful migraine ?! If that's your idea of love , then I'm definitely feeling it , J.M.B.

It's official . I will convince < PROPMALE > to restore the League of Extraordinary Jews ! 
So how about that Watson ? < PROPMALE > didn't could keep up with Watson or < PROPMALE > . I am actually surprised .

I want to apologize to Grelle Sutcliff ( a.k.a. McKayla ) on behalf of my < PROPMALE > peers for having to do extra work , even though as smart as you are , I'm sure it was a piece of cake . 
I haven't figured it out yet ... I always bring myself down while attempting to compliment others ... Could someone explain why I do this ? If not just tell me to stop doing such a thing and also to stop posting statuses such as this . It's whatever ... I need a vacation ... with friends ... ( sobs in corner ) I'M NOT CRYING !!! ( runs away into room ) 
I woke up today wanting to hug friends while knowing that it is not possible to do that . Not today . I'm enjoying my day , alright ... not ... 
Chili makes me happier ? Yes . Homemade chili ? Even more so . Will the happiness last ? I doubt it ... Knowing that I am the individual that controls the ultimate outcome of my life ? Priceless . 
I have my hopes and I am going to achieve them , no matter what event crosses my path to slow me down . I will conquer it . But , obviously , nobody can do such a thing alone . I'm glad to have the friends that I have . 
I think that on Facebook , < PROPMALE > Alford is my stalker . He's being a creeper because I got on with 7 notifications that had him in it . You stalker ... I enjoy it ... Take it as you see it ... 
I hope I can get myself someone to be with . Someone to love . But , I'm not complaining about it . I CAN go on until I die . And my health is improving due to the fact that I am losing weight . Makes my < PROPFEMALE > even more tested . I welcome the challenge if it does so present itself . 
What do I want more than anything ? I want my friends to be happy and loved and not have to deal with the inane drivel the rest of the world spews at them . You all are the world to me . So of you more than others , but that comes with the territory . My ultimate dream in life is to see everyone I hold dear to be unhindered by the stress life throws at them , even if just for one day . <3 
You know , it's pretty annoying when you're doing something on Teh Interwebz and your cat decides to go climb up on the highest thing there is that is also next to the plug that the computers and stuff are connected into . Luckily , I didn't have to do much to get back here ... 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Devereaux seems to be the most spirited when it comes to these poke wars I've been having . <3

Well , it's been a lovely night , but I'm going to end the night for myself really soon and I'll start by logging off of Facebook for tonight . <3 to all !

Me needs a life , me thinks ... 
If it wasn't for friends and family , I'd be nothing more than a biological organism that killed itself due to it's lack of self-worth , or so it thought it was lacking such . I owe my life to all of my friends . I mean it . The only thing I can do for you is give you all my undying love because once my spirit is lifted , it needs only to adjust to it's new height until it begins to further ascend . <3

What is my life without friends ? Nothing . Why is it that friendships tend to define a person ? Maybe it's simply another one of those traits of humanity . 
I just beat Killer Instinct for the SNES on the hardest level with my favorite character Jago . Hey < PROPMALE > Alford , U mad ? : /J 
Everyone , I give you Owens , my film's secondary protagonist . 
This change ... I just feel suddenly in control of my life . I've never noticed it as clearly as I am seeing it now . Probably because my Cancer side takes over to the bank of the lake on < PROPFEMALE > days such as this . It really is calming and tranquilizing . I feel so happy right now . I wish this could never end . <3 
Uh ... so which came first ? The chocobo or the egg ? I , honestly , think the moogle came first ... 
Screw IHOP pancakes ! I got my own ! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA !!!!!!!!!!!! 
If I were a younger kid , I would be having nightmares over what I just watched , starring < PROPMALE > Goldblum and Geena < PROPMALE > . 
I'm a person that can't lose friendships that easily . I've only lost two . That's it . People lose friendships here and there too often . I'm glad I haven't lost many friends over the years . 
I feel like telling people what my favorite thing about them is . Like this status if you'd like me to tell you . Comment on this status with your favorite thing about me . 
I'm so weary of inane drivel ... Let us converse some more ! Someone . Talk to me . I'm on break . Talk . 
Oh my god ... a whole bunch of vocab copied down . Next : vocab in another language ! AGH !!! Someone shoot something other than me for me !

I seek the pinnacle of joy , the central cause of belief , the top of the tower to which loyalty is held truer than detectable by the divinity of any deity , the definitive light behind the silhouette of my cumbersome obstacles , the sheer tranquility achievable through that which only I can believe myself to overcome , aided only by the love of all my friends . The will to go on will get me through this journey . 
You know what ? MY day has officially ended and I need to congratulate my film on a job well done for today's shoot . Screw what I'm supposed to be attending right now because MY computer clock has elapsed 24 hours . I move it . : /J 
It's official . I get way too philosophical at night .

I think this could work to our advantage . 
I'm sure that a lot of you don't believe that diplomacy works , but believe me , if you add diplomacy to an anger and rage-fueled conversation on something that one person started by telling all of the people involved their phone number and unintentionally turned into a complication that spread across over 200 people's Facebooks and was sent directly to some peoples phones , you might just make a difference . 
So I'm burning a CD ( yeah , I'm THAT much a f***ing old timer ) with some of my favorite bits from Donkey Kong Country 2 : Diddy's Kong Quest , Final Fantasy IX , and < PROPMALE > Meier's Pirates ! I'm liking myself right now ... 
Oh my god , I know it's not the best thing in the world FOR ME , it could just be the best thing in the world . I really do <3 my mother's cooking . 
My day was really fantastic . If only everyday were like this one yet were exponentially better than the previous one ! Tranquility has certainly befallen me this day ! :) 
I'd be happier about Spring Break if I had something to do . And I'd ALSO want to go to prom this year if I had a good reason to . So far , I haven't found a good reason to go to prom this year . Any reasons I should go ? And , no , threatening to kick my ass is NOT a reason . 
So I was playing < PROPFEMALE > Wars : Knights of the Old Republic II The Sith Lords , and I was going to switch party members , but Atton and Bao-Dur weren't there and where Atton's level and class was supposed to be had said , \ I AM BROKEN SO VERY VERY BROKEN . \ " Then the game froze on me . I turned off my XBOX and turned the game back on . I'm glad I saved before that happened ! " 
True embarrassment is when you have a retro < PROPFEMALE > singing to you about how much he is Never Gonna Give You Up . lol 
I'm going to be watching Bleach at 12:00 and Kekkaishi at 12:30 . I want to talk to somebody before 12 . I doubt anyone is going to want to talk to me ... 
What irritates me is when I'm playing Killer Instinct , I have a perfect combo going and then suddenly \C-C-C-COMBO BREAKER !!! \ " and then I'm like \ " Ffffffffffff !!! \ " lol "

I ALMOST wish it weren't Spring Break anymore because I'm tired of it feeling like a freaking SUNDAY all the time ! ): l 
was playing Chrono Trigger a while ago and realized , \Oh god I'm such a hopeless little child because this has got to be the like 10th I've played it my entire life and about 5 or so new game +'s ... \ " And he wonders why he doesn't have a girlfriend ... " 
Oh ... how the break is almost over ... just think everyone ... Hopefully none of you need to wake up too early on Monday ... But come Tuesday ... I miss the sight and sound of all of my friends congregated into a singular mass ... ... Okay ... maybe not too tightly , but you get what I mean , right ? 
I wonder , and if anyone would be so kind as to answer , does anybody \look up to me ? \ " I look up to the closest of my friends ... But does anyone look up to me ? " 
I wish everyone tonight a very calming and desirable respite .

Emulatin ' Killer Instinct on MAME ( Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator ) and kickin ' butt from all of the practice on the hardest level for the SNES version . I feel accomplished ! 
Call me a conformist , consider me a friend , either way , I'm bored and feeling honest . ( pops knuckles ) TBH time !

I was confronted with the possibility of my family moving to Pennsylvania after I graduate . It's actually a pretty high possibility ... I don't want to leave after graduating like that . But with the current stupidity of the common people in South Florida , mother is getting sick and tired of it . I am too , but I've lived here my whole life . And to leave it just when things start to get going ... Wow ...
