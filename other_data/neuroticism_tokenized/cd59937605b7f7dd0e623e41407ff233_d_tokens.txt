Love never dies a natural death . It dies because we don't know how to replenish its source . It dies of blindness and errors and betrayals . It dies of illness and wounds ; it dies of weariness , of witherings , of tarnishings .

“Maybe mistakes are what make our fate ... without them what would shape our lives ? Maybe if we had never veered off course we wouldn't fall in love , have babies , or be who we are . After all , things change , so do cities , people come into your life and they go . But it's comforting to know that the ones you love are always in your heart ... and if you're very lucky , a plane ride away”\ 
Sex and the City
