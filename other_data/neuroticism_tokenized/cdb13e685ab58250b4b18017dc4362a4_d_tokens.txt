I think I need to invest in actual snow gear ; sneakers , ankle socks and jeans do not cut it when you are thigh deep in this stuff . Also where the heck do you put the snow when you don't have a yard !?! 

First taxes , now FAFSA - the fun never ends ! 
You could get a job stomping out < PROPMALE > fires . 
I've had Doodle for a month and five days . In that time frame he has been : charged twice by large dogs , bit by a mole , and suffered severely swollen eyes . It has been and adventure . 
The dog is very upset at the couch today . He keeps barking at it . Very strange . 
Tomorrow is Doodle's second attempt at getting groomed and a trial run at the kennel to make sure he isn't too \aggressive or difficult\ " for them . I'm so nervous ! " 
The kennel was a success even though he was shaking like a leaf . In a few hours we attempt the groomers . 
The groomer's was a success as well !! No muzzle needed !!! 
So the obedience trainers said my dog is very smart with a strong personality . I don't know if that is a good or not ... At least they think he is cute . 
Thank you everyone for your birthday wishes ! 
There's nothing like finding an old file and realizing you have most of term paper already written thanks to an old assignment from another class !! Woo-hoo ! 
That is one big < PROPFEMALE >
