It all has to end sometime . 
How far is it possible to fall ? 
Does anyone else feel like their life is a soap opera ? Like this if you do . 
Nothing feels quite right anymore , but I feel older and wiser , but like a little kid , and stronger but weaker , all at the same time . Life is strange . 
' s life is way too confusing . And all the people I want to talk to most right now are rather inaccessable . 
Hates carrides with her family . 
Is getting fed up with life and the world . It's turning out to be so much more complicated than it looked like only a few years ago .
