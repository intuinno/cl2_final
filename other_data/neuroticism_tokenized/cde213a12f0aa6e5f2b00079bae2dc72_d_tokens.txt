Thunderstorms are interesting things . And \so\ " is a weird word - we can use it for so many things . " 
It's always nice to come home and find that your brother has taken your darts , and decided that your whole room was a target . AFTER the dartboard ( Which was brand new ) had been completely pocked with holes .
