I think my interview went well , we'll see soon . 
Why you so obsessed with me ? Lyin ' that you're sexin ' me .

And now I just sent my old account a friend request and I got an email saying to confirm the request I sent myself , lol . But I can't log into that account anymore with the email , even though they still send me updates WITH THAT EMAIL . That ain't nothin ' but the Devil !

wishes people could debate politics based on the policies and not on their stereotypes about what the \left\ " or \ " right\ " is like . This idea of liberal vs . conservative in which one side ( either side ) believes the other side is some homogenous group who all share the same opinions is a blatant and sad generalization . "

THE FACEBOOK TRICK : press up , up , down , down , left , right , left , right , B , A , Enter key , then right click then press up and down and magic circles will appear . the only way to get rid of them is to log off or refresh the page ... IT WILL WORK ! Put this as your status if it works .

The only real freedom is the freedom to oppress others , lol . J/k , j/k . 
feels like a squirrel carcass ! 
has to stop thinking he's friends with people he watches on youtube and has never actually spoken to , lol . * Drugs *

I hate everything ! I wish I could find my calling . 
the deeper you stick it in your vein , the deeper the thoughts there's no more pain . I'm in Heaven , I'm a god , I'm everywhere , I feel so hot .

How can you debate the existence of something you know nothing about ? How can you believe or disbelieve in something you don't understand to begin with ? How can you define and assign attributes to something you have no knowledge of ?

Odi omnia 
About to fall asleep at work . 
I'm surprised at how many Halil Gencer's there are on FB . 
The ennui is setting in once again . I'm becoming profoundly dissatisfied with the purposelessness of life -- not my life in particular , just the predicament of life in general . It's just not enough -- mundane , rote shit and then death . I hate the way we've organized society , it's so constricting . 
I'm getting a new laptop . This time I want one with a webcam , so I can finally start my internet porn business . 
Sticks and stones may break my bones , but chains and whips excite me !

Revolution is contagious and I love every minute of it ! 
I prefer a sharp sting to a dull ache . 
Everything's the same . Everything's different . I got lost in the rain .

I hate myself , lol . I just watched \Twilight\ " for the first time and .... I . Liked . It . " 
I was working out at the gym today ( if you can believe it ) and this girl walked up to me and was like \are you okay ? \ " and then she proceeded to tell me to \ " smile more\ " since there was always something to be \ " happy\ " about . She's now in the trunk of my car ... which makes me happy . ? " 
So I just went on this gay chatroulette thing , and : ( 1 ) there are a disproportionately large amount of French speaking gay guys and ( 2 ) my self-esteem is ruined , lol .
