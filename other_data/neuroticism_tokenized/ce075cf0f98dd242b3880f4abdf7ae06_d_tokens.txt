It is often the bigger choices we make , that define us as people . 
We learn to think about everything , and then we train our eyes to look as we think about the things we look at . We look at ourselves already thinking that we are important . And therefore we've got to feel important ! But then when a man learns to see , he realizes that he can no longer think about the things he looks at , and if he cannot think about what he looks at everything becomes unimportant . 
Will is something very clear and powerful which can direct our acts . Will is something a man uses , for instance , to win a battle which he , by all calculations , should lose . It is not what we call courage . Courage is something else . Men of courage are ... dependable men , < PROPMALE > men perennially surrounded by people who flock around them and admire them ; yet very few men of courage have will . 
Gotta go to work .... bummer . =/ 
I'm so sleepy . /yawn .....! 
We < PROPFEMALE > on an internal talk . We talk about our world . In fact we maintain our world with our internal talk . Whenever we finish talking to ourselves the world is always as it should be . We renew it , we kindle it with life , we uphold it with our internal talk . Not only that , but we also choose our paths as we talk to ourselves . Thus we repeat the same choices over and over until the day we die . 
In order to find the proper place to rest all one has to do is to cross the eyes . The technique takes years to perfect . It consists of gradually forcing your eyes to see separately the same image . The lack of image conversion entails a double perception of the world ; this double perception allows one the opportunity of judging changes in the surroundings , which the eyes are ordinarily incapable of perceiving . 
Ipod touch is nearly in my grasp . =D 
I need to change my photo . 
Screw getting up early . /yawn And then chopping weeds

HA ! It's almost Complete ! All I have to do now , is make a kick-ass background for it . Debating between : < PROPFEMALE > Clouds ( really gray ) , and Ice storm theme , or Fire . Or a Mixture of Ice and fire ... Like the background is fire , and the Iceacles fade from its nature blue to the redness of the fire towards the background . 
Back and Forth - < PROPFIRST > Brion . This song is hard to find . For those of you who don't know what its from , its from Step Brothers . When < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > get kicked out and act like adults . I cannot find this song for the life of me .

Walmart = Fail ugh 
Nobody told me what you thought . Nobody told me what to say . Everyone showed you where to turn . Told you when to run away . nobody told you where to hide . Nobody told you what to say . Everyone showed you where to turn . Showed you when to runaway ! 
People fail to realize how much the objects they possess actually control them . Everyone is too far driven into technology , money , and greed , that they should , yet cannot ask themselves : \What should I really < PROPFEMALE > in my only life ? What is most precious to me ? \"" 
ugh ... Walmart >.< 
ugh 
Good God 
What you accomplish is irrelevant . But if you are absent in this moment , you will regret it for the rest of what will be , a miserable life .
