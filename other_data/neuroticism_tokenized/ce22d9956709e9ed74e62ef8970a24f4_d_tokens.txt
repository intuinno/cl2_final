Please put this on your status if you know someone ( or are related to someone ) who is an idiot . Idiots affect the lives of many . There is still no known cure for stupidity , but we can raise awareness . 93% wont copy and paste this , many because they're too stupid to know how to copy and paste . Will YOU make this your status for at least one hour ? 
You know your from oklahoma if ... A tornado warning siren is your signal to go out in the yard and look for a funnel . HaaHaa ... I love it ! :O )

Thought of you today , but that is nothing new . I thought about you yesterday , and days before that too . I think of you in silence , I often speak your name . All I have are memories and a picture in a frame . Your memory is a keepsake , with which I'll never part . God has you in His keeping , I have you in my heart .

One of the final challenges for human beings is to get old with as much \ 
verve and gumption as possible . Old parents who keep on being interested\ 
in life give a subtle kind of sustenance to their children ; they are \ 
givers of hope and affirmers of life . 
=) A true\ 
friend doesn't care if you're broke , you're slightly mental at times , \ 
your house is a mess , or your family is filled with crazies ... They love\ 
you for who you are . True friends can go LONG PERIODS of time without \ 
speaking and never question their friendship . RE-POST if you are lucky enough to have at least one true friend . <3

Life is only as beautiful as you perceive it to be and believe it can be . Assure that everyday you do your best and help all around you to make it great . We are each only responsible for this much and doing that little bit can add up to make the biggest difference for you and all around you . This my goal day in and day out . 
Thank you everyone for all of the birthday wishes . <3 Today has been an awesome day , worked 12 to 10:30 today and had a great surprise at the end of the shift meeting this afternoon . 
Hope everyone's having a good week ! Today is Friday for me , well kinda , off < PROPMALE > , work wed , and then off thurs . Definitely ready for a day off , it is much needed . Looking forward to < PROPMALE > orrow , going to dinner @ The Elephant Bar . Love that place !! Lots of love to all <3 
dont worry , about a thing . cause every little thing , is gonna be alright ?

watched me succeed , saw me fail , cheered me on and kept me strong . Moms \

Today was a really good day , worked a 12 1/2 hour shift and learned some new things . Happy to be home , back at it in the morning . Hope everyone's had a great day ! <3 
Happiness\ 
and positivity are a choice , which many do not understand . Life is a \ 
choice in itself , as in you choose to be happy or not . =) We all need to\ 
be positive and pass that positivity on to each other . Not all are at \ 
the place in their ... \ 
lives to understand this at this time . But your one moment of \ 
understanding could change this . 
Life is great ! I love < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > much ! She is such a happy little girl . <3<3<3

Good Morning ! Better to be an hour early than an hour late I suppose , swear I was in at 10 instead of eleven . Good thing I brought my book today :)

PLEASE put this as your status if you know someone who has been eaten by dragons . Dragons are nearly unstoppable and , in case you didn't know , totally breathe fire . 60% of people WON'T copy and paste this because they have already been eaten by dragons . 38% of people are sitting in the shower armed with fire extinguishers , and the remaining 2% are awesome and will re-post this .

Have an awesome day !! <3 It's beautiful outside ! =) 
Life is beautiful ! I have the best family in the world <3 
There comes a point in your life when FUN no longer means bar hopping , clubbing , being out till 4am or drinking too much . It means movies , family dinners , kids athletic events , bedtime stories and 9pm bedtimes . Becoming a parent doesn't change you , it makes you realize that the little people you created deserve the best of your free time ! 
No matter what happens , no matter what obstacles are thrown our way , together with the love of family and friends we will conquer all without hesitation . Beyond words for how grateful I am to have the people in my life that I do . =)
