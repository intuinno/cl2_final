Misses lots of things about < PROPFEMALE > dance , but didn't realize how much I missed wearing black tights , black shorts , and dance sneakers . Just add a wig and some O'Shea gear and it's that pre-competition feeling I miss so much .

Racism : Keep your hate to yourself . Everyone has it in them somewhere ( we're human ) , but I really don't care for hearing your inventive obscenities . It's ( more than ) annoying . 
I guess bad things do come in threes .
