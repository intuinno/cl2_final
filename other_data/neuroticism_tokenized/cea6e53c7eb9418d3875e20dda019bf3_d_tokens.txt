Fortunately , there is a key to unlatch this box . 
Got interviewed by Fox 26 news at work today . You can see me , < PROPFEMALE > , Rue , and Two Boxies on Mon . 5:00 pm Fox News 26 . Hope I look Good !

Found the first baby box turtles of this year today . 5 beautiful new faces . 
Today is < PROPFIRST > and my 28th anniversary ! 09/09/09- ani't that cool ? :D 
Thanks to all of you who were concerned about Bowser . I got him back !!! The guy was lucky he told me where he lived and that he just wanted the $100.00 to reimburse him for what he spent . I took < PROPFEMALE > from animal control and her boy friend a Bay City police officer with me . It was their day off so they just had on their regular clothes . I'd already had his phone number traced . 
OMG !!!!! Just found out the AFI is comming to < PROPMALE > 11/21 , and I can't find any good seats . I thought I was keeping up on this-grrrrr 
OK , I'm obsessed . I'm seeing AFI on Saturday in < PROPMALE > , and driving to < PROPFIRST > to see them on Sunday . Maybe I'll be seeing them in Vegas on < PROPFIRST > . 31st . What the heck life is short . 
It's funny how some people can have such strong opinions on things they don't really know anything about . It reminds me of a quote from THE < PROPMALE > AND I : Most people don't see the world as it is , they see it how THEY are . 
Leavin for Vegas < PROPFIRST > . 26th . Gonna see my fav . band , my sis < PROPFEMALE > , hopefully a lot of my friends , my girls , and my new AFI friends !!!!! See y'all there . 
Going to Vegas on tues . Hope to see some of my friends while I there . Facebook me , K . 
Leavin for Vegas Tuesday 
Vegas was great , AFI was hot , back to reality 
Reality sucks ! 
New Orleans and AFI March 19th . OMG I'm so addicted !! 
New Motto : \I'm not going to work with somebody that I have to < PROPMALE > to help\ " I mean it ! " 
Well I'll so glad to be able to identify with the phase that no good deed goes unpunished . :( 
AFI and New Oreleans this Friday !!!!!!! 
AFI in New Orleans was great !!!! Saw saw < PROPMALE > walking to the House of Blues . I told him I was looking forward to the show . Yaaaa 
OMG , take < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > out of Texas school books ! What is happening to this country , Texas will be laughing stock , and we will have ignorant Kids ! 
My Baby Girl < PROPFEMALE > is Graduating from A&M in Corpus < PROPFEMALE > on Saturday . YEA < PROPFEMALE > ! Dad and I are so proud of you !! 
My < PROPFEMALE > must have collected Some mighty good < PROPFEMALE > , to already have a job in her field right after graduating . Say hello to a new producer at Channel 6 News , Corpus Christi . \ 
She's my little < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Moore ! Ha Ha !!!!! 
AFI it's time to see you again , see you Saturday !!! 
Being thankful for AFI and < PROPFEMALE > Grey . Its nice to listen to music that reaches your soul . Thanks for doing what you do , and being incredibly great people while you're doing it ! 
Set yourself up for Sucess ! 
Ahhhh ! Got to cut up mice for the sick owl , tube feed the oppossums , feed the baby birds , feed the sick snapping turtle , give meds . and fluids to the Mississippi Kite , and much more , but I'm not complaining . 
OK , whatever , we'll see who I invite on my next adventure , It will probably be people who are over 40 . Or just me , I like my own company . 
Loolin for < PROPFEMALE > , my < PROPFEMALE > boa . He escaped into the house day before yesterday . 
Found my snake , yea ! 
This is my line , this is eternal\ 
\ 
How did I ever end up here ? \ 
Discarnate , preternatural\ 
My prayers to disappear\ 
Absent of grace , marked as infernal\ 
Ungranted in dead time left me disowned\ 
To this nature , so unnatural\ 
I remain alone 
I'll be talking with our next Governor of Texas Tomorrow . < PROPMALE > White Is A Good Man . 
Ok , this is stupid . I managed to miss AFI in Irvine , CA cause I got the time wrong . Heard their last 3 songs while running thru the parking lot . Green Day was great , they played for 3 hours and 10 minutes . I had a great time with my nieces too . Good trip ! 
Linkin Park's new CD comes out on the 14th . Yea ! 
Hey , today is my 29th anniversary ! Wouldn't trade him for anything . 
Today , I'm annoyed ! 
Autumn , a GREAT time of year ! Air is cooler , Time for family and friends to gather , Halloween , Thanksgiving , Renfest , No baby birds ! I love this time of year ! 
Texas Renascence Festival-Opening day Saturday . See you there !!!!! 
The better I know people the more I like my snake . Seriously ! 
No good deed goes unpunished . I Finally understand the full meaning of that phrase now . Also a leopard can't changed his spots , and you can't make a silk purse out of a pigs ear . These are all truisms . I guess you truly can't help most people , a hard lesson for me to learn but how many times do I have to have it shoved into my face . I'm done lesson learned . :[ 
Not one Trick or Treater came by tonight . :( 
OMG ! Thanksgiving is around the corner , house full of people , I'm not prepared . =( 
Happy Thanksgiving to all my facebook friends . Have you thought about the things that YOU are thankful for ? 
These are dark times , there is no denying . Our world has perhaps faced \ 
no greater threat than it does today . But I say this to our citizenry : \ 
We , ever your servants , will continue to defend your < PROPFEMALE > and repel \ 
the forces that seek to take it from you ! Your Ministry remains , strong . 
LET'S SEE WHO IS PAYING ATTENTION . EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU ARE ON MY FRIENDS LIST AS A RESULT OF A CONSCIOUS DECISION . I WANT YOU THERE . I AM NOT ONLY GLAD TO COUNT YOU AS FRIENDS BUT ALSO FAMILY . LETS SEE WHO ACTUALLY PAYS ATTENTION . COPY THIS AS YOUR STATUS JUST FOR A MINUTE . I'LL BE WATCHING TO SEE WHO REALLY DOES ... < PROPFEMALE > FAMILY ...... & FRIENDSHIP . THANK YOU FOR BEING PART OF MY LIFE . 
< PROPFIRST > hit a hog on his way to work the other day (<PROPFIRST>' way to work , not the hogs ) . Man , that really puts a dent in a fender . I'll submit some photo's later . By the way there is a little flesh , fur , and blood in the pictures , so they are not for the faint of heart . ;P 
< PROPFEMALE > , your damn snake bit me ! 
Happy Holidays to all my friends and family here on facebook . I hope this holiday season and the coming new year will be a blessed one . Blessed Be , < PROPFEMALE > 
AHHH ! Finally back after two weeks of helping my two girls move . One to a new apartment , one to < PROPFIRST > . I'm exhausted !
