Happy New Year to all my friends and family . Love you all ! Trust that this year will be the best you have EVER live in ! 

It is HOOOOOOTTTTTTT out there ............. gonna have to coool off to get a shower ! 
Thinking 
I never knew < PROPMALE>'s Dad , or Mother for that matter , but I know the man they raised and I'm proud of him and the great person that he is and I know it comes from their influence on him . 
OK ..... This ballgame is getting nerve racking .......... 
Today's words of encouragement : Someone once told me that no one would love me if they REALLY knew me ...... I knew deep down that wasn't true , cause GOD made me and He doesn't make junk ! 
Missouri is looking better all the time ! 
Now what are we gonna watch ? 
Going outside to sweat a little ...... hehehehehe ...... cleanse the pores ( ulterior motive ) .......... then need to bathe < PROPFEMALE > . < PROPFIRST > got his bath last night , which entilted him to sleep in the BIG bed . He did very well . We only got up once ( at 3 AM ) . Then g 
Let's see , Pookie , Nae-Nae , Peanut and < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > .... what a family 
Woke up early ..... dreaming of painting submarines ....... and NOT yellow ..... blue , silver , white for camouflage . Nobody ask me why .... cause I don't have a clue ! 
Eating fresh baked bread pudding ..... mmmmmmm good ! 
What an ending to a race ! 
If you live in the < PROPMALE > area and need your house cleaned ...... call Ms. Angel Hanks .......... she did a WONDERFUL job on our house today . She had a < PROPMALE > mess to deal will and she did a bang up job ! 
YEAH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Get to REALLY sleep in tomorrow ! 
Now this could be an interesting premise for a reality show ..... dating in the dark ....... hmmmmm ............. have to see how this goes ........ 
Am sooooo glad to be off work for a couple of days . 
Many thanks to Angel for \dog sitting\ " the puppies so they don't have to go to the kennel . < PROPFEMALE > especially will love it ! " 
Headed to bed ............... nitey nite every one !

Thought for the week : Even the knowledge of my own fallibility cannot keep me from making mistakes . Only when I fall do I get up again . -- < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Gogh 
Happy anniversary to my great parents ........ not many folks these days can say they have been married 55 years ! 
Well , all you URC folks out there , I just finished my FIM exam ...... 
Guess what ? ....... One of our nurses , < PROPFEMALE > , scored 100% on the FIM Exam ........ GO < PROPFEMALE > !!!!!!!!!! 
LSU ........................ 
Ok , all you dog lovers and experts ....... why does my 6 month old puppy's breath smell like sour milk ? And how do we get rid of it ? I've googled the problem and can't find an answer ......... 
I'm begging to wonder that if I can't afford to go on vacation or to expensive concerts , etc . and I'm still paying part of someone's bills who CAN afford these things OR I have loaned money to someone who can afford to go to these activities and have not been paid back the loan ........... somehow I'm getting the raw end of this deal ! 
I am VERY proud of my son ! 
Never know how much to appreciate air conditioning in the car until it's not working ! 
Nap time here ...... Lucy on one couch ..... Jim and < PROPFIRST > on the other and me on computer ...... lazy Saturday afternoon ....... fixin to rain ............ 
Here at Lake Bruin and found out they have wireless internet .... whooohooo ! How about that . Come camping and bring the computer so you can get on the internet .... LOL . 
By the time that swine flu vaccine gets here , we get it and have to take 3 weeks to build up immunity ............ everybody will have already it !!!! 
Glad the weekend is here . Been a long week . We were going to Stone County for < PROPMALE>'s ballgame but we were just worn out ..... tooo old .... LOL . So we'll be at home this weekend . Go WAR EAGLES !!!!! 
I wish I had the money ......... 
The Obama Sing-Along that < PROPFEMALE > posted is really scary ......

We are out of milk so I'm sitting here eating Frosted Flakes out of the box .....

OK , Friends and Family ..... vote for < PROPFIRST > E . Batson's < PROPMALE > to win a wonderful game room for the kiddos that have to be hospitalized . Our family has benefited from the services of this hospital . You don't have to be from Mississippi to vote ........... anybody can vote ..... you get 10 votes per day . You don't even have to be in the States to vote ! Contest is over on the 16th . 
Trying to figure out where my doggie valium disappeared to ? I know that's not good English , but we had 9 tablets and on ly 2 of them are left ..... hmmmmmmmm .............

Well , went back for a 2nd try and think I'm hooked on the Sweet Adelines - Ladies , if you like to sing , live in the < PROPMALE > metro area , come join us on Monday evenings . It's great FUN ! 
Happy birthday to my Dad . He is a wonderful man . Will go out of his way to help other people . He never asks for praise or thanks for what he does and he very rarely gets it . No one will probably ever know how many people he has helped and served because he never tells all he does . He's a VERY special person and I love him very much ! 
Wishing my son a very happy 21st birthday ...... I am VERY proud of the young man he has become and the responsibilities he is assuming . He has more common sense than a lot of people twice his age . That is something you can't teach people . Love you , < PROPFIRST > ! 
I am sooooo thankful for my husband ..... he keeps me going and constantly surprises me with his thoughtfulness ........... like weekend in New Orleans .... I love you , < PROPMALE > Cooksey ! 
I'm gonna be SORE tomorrow ...... 5 days off and just sitting around during those days .... now gonna pay .......
