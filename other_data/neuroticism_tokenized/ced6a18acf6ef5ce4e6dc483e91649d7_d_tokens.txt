Thanks to all those providing birthday wishes . The question I have to ask myself is \what is a happy birthday ? \ " Did I have a \ " happy birthday\ " ? That is a question I'm not sure how to answer . " 
For those who don't know , tomorrow ( 12/20 ) I will be having carpal tunnel surgery on both hands . There is not going to be anyone staying with me but lots of people stopping in to help . If you need to contact me , phone would be best . 
Surgery went good . At home recuperating . Limited computer access . I will have limited use of my hands over the next few weeks . Thanks to all for thoughts and prayers . Calls are fine . 
First day back at work ... was not too bad .
