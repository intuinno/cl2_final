Leave a memory that you and I had together . \ 
It doesn't matter if you know me a little or a lot , anything you \ 
remember . Don't send a message , leave a comment here . Next , leave this \ 
as your status and see how many people leave a memory about you . 
I don't understand people that find it necessary to focus so much on the things they hate and put so much effort into ... hating . Idunno . Personally , I'd rather focus on the things and people I love . 
got a six pack of honeymoon , a pizza , how i met your mother on dvd , and mah boyfrin ' to cuddle up next to . i'm good for the night . ? 
today is a sleepy day . 
RIP < PROPFIRST > gray . :(

i think i give up on trying to sleep . x.X 
you can't kill the metal . the metal will live on . no one can destroy the metal . the metal will strike you down with a vicious blow .

when i was little i wanted to be a power ranger when i grew up . when i was in middle school i wanted to be a photographer . when i was in high school i considered being a piercer . these days ?? i kind of want to be a power ranger again .

camera camera camera camera cameracameracameradkjfaslkdjfkd 
what is it about me that attracts creepy old dudes ? let's just ignore the fact that i'm in my 20's , because i LOOK like a 14-year-old and SOUND like a 5-year-old ... so i can't help but be disturbed . 
< PROPFIRST > finally shaved his mustache ! i can actually kiss him again ! 
i like how when you look at my profile picture all < PROPFEMALE > , it looks like < PROPFIRST > and i are making out or something and being gross . but if you look at it full-size , we're actually just being retarded . 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas , Christians ! Happy Holiday , Pastafarians ! 
internet , you are very boring today . 
< PROPFIRST > and i got so many things done for the wedding today . pretty fuckin ' exciting , if you ask meeeee . ? 
daaaaamn , < PROPFIRST > ! you jumped in a creek for a burrito ? what would you do for a klondike bar , kill your wife ? 
ohh myyy goddd homemade tamales <3 
cutting < PROPFIRST>'s hair , omg . 
bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored bored 
i'm forcing < PROPFIRST > to watch rainbow brite and the < PROPFEMALE > stealer with me . <3 :3 
is winter over yet , please ?? 
i've been itching to take pictures lately .. who wants to be my model ?? ( totally serious ) 
in the past 12 hours i've probably listened to the new protest the hero song ... 10 times at least . not even kidding . * sigh * 
i hate the way facebook makes you view pictures now . so annoying . 
you got it , joben ! 
i love that i can be having the worst possible day and as soon as < PROPFIRST > walks through that door and wraps his arms around me , none of it matters at all anymore . 
? happy < PROPFIRST>'s day ? \ 
you have a lot of options today ! you can :\ 
a ) mope about because you're single\ 
b ) rant about commercialism\ 
c ) bitch because your significant other has \let you down\ " \ 
one of my biggest pet peeves : it's 2011 and it seems like everyone still just assumes that a woman getting married is planning to take her husband's last name . 
:) 
5 years ago today , < PROPFIRST > asked me to be his girlfriend . :) 
soooooo ... i bleached my hair . 
Copy this post if you or someone you know knows someone or knows someone who might know someone . It will raise awareness of being aware . 
just bought the new protest the hero album ! * happy dance *
