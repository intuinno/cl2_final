My bday is in one week . 18 here i come

I have green hair now . YES !!!! 
found < PROPMALE > Horror Picture Show at Walmart !!!!! 
getting ready to move and moms surgery is a bitch 
decided to go to prom . oh boy . what did i get myself into . 
computer was attacked and crashed so i won't be on for a long while 
so because my old comp broke down i got to have my graduation present early . a new windows 7 laptop 
looking for adoptable kittens is freakin ' hard 
my house is officially on sale now ! woot 
i am a pack so to solve some of my issues i am selling a shoe box full of < PROPFEMALE > gi oh cards . 75 80 dollars it may seem much but with what all is in there it is worth it . 
I have dreamt of a place for you and I No one knows who we are there All I want is to give my life only to you I've dreamt so long I cannot dream anymore Let's run away , I'll take you there 
Graduation is 2 months away ! Yes !... Oh man . Country roads , take me home To the place , I be-long West < PROPFEMALE > , mountain momma Take me home , country roads 
Today is the best day ever and i feel like nothing can damper it . My teacher gave me help on a paper to redeem my grade , i am going on a long waited trip saturday and i asked the guy i like out and he said YES ! i have my very first boyfriend and couldn't feel any more happier than i feel now . 
For those of you who have my number and are able to text me ... DON'T DO IT ! I AM RUNNING OUT OF MINUTES !!!! 
ok so i am still out of minutes on my phone . God i wish i had a real phone with unlimited texting to talk to him . i have to use a friends phone just to text him . i feel bad on the bright side i get to go shopping . hmmm i wonder what i will get him ? just kidding i already know . then i get to see him tomorrow . YES 
ok till fruther notice DO NOT TEXT ME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i am so tired going to bed tt4n 
I was chasing my dreams With a coke and a smile Only You make me happy If that was the real thing Then I’m in denial Only You make me happy Now my heart’s on my sleeve Don’t care if I’m not in style Only You make me happy Superficial Fake And fleeting Fashion statements have no meaning Only You make me happy Only You make me happy Everything will change But You remain the same Only You make me happy 
My boyfriend's back , and you're gonna be in trouble ( Hey la , hey la , my boyfriend's back ) When you see him comin ' , better cut on the double ( Hey la , hey la , my boyfriend's back ) You've been spreadin ' lies that I was untrue ( Hey la , hey la , my boyfriend's back ) So look out now , ' cause he's comin ' after you ( Hey la , hey la , my boyfriend's back ) 
Dear my love , haven't you wanted to be with me And dear my love , haven't you longed to be free I can't keep pretending that I don't even know you And at sweet night , you are my own Take my hand We're leaving here tonight There's no need to tell anyone They'd only hold us down So by the morning light We'll be half way to anywhere Where love is more than just your name 
just because i have joined a lot of groups supporting gay rights and all that comes with that does NOT make me GAY . i support it because we have no right on how to tell others who they should love and how they should love . get over yourselves ppl . 
If you approve gay-marriages put this in your profile and add your name to the list : < PROPFEMALE > 
I wish for this nigh t-t ime to last for a life-time The darkness around me - shores of a solar sea Oh how I wish to go down with the sun Sleeping Weeping With you 
I'm not a stranger , no , I am yours With crippled anger and tears that still drip sore A fragile frame aged with misery And when our eyes meet I know you'll see I do not wanna be afraid I do not wanna die inside just to breathe in I'm tired of feeling so numb Relief exists , I find it when I am cut 
That I love you I have loved you all along And I miss you Been far away for far too long I keep dreaming you'll be with me and you'll never go Stop breathing if I don't see you anymore 
Nights in white satin , Never reaching the end , Letters I've written , Never meaning to send . Beauty Id always missed With these eyes before , Just what the truth is I can't say anymore . Cause I love you , Yes , I love you , Oh , how , I love you . 
I wish I had your pair of wings Just like last night in my dreams I was lost in paradise Wish I'd never opened my eyes Sometimes I wish I were an angel Sometimes I wish I were you Sometimes I wish I were an angel Sometimes I wish I were you 
its funny in how short a time , how much i love him . http://chatter.com/a/4z9wd?ref=nf 
got the cleaning done . yay !!! http://chatter.com/a/52mna?ref=nf 
I said this world , this world . Could leave us anyday But my love for you , it will never go away . And I don't wanna go to sleep Cuz ' you are like a dream For every night I say a prayer , And I swear you are the answer You're an angel , you're an angel , you're an angel . 
continued ... I will miss you , my friend , As you travel on your way . But I know that someday , somewhere , If the gods will it , We will meet again ; And the meeting will be one of love . May the blessings of the Lord and the Lady Be with you as you travel on your way ! Know that my love and blessings go with you As you travel to the Land of Eternal Summer . Blessed Be ! \ " , 201 0-0 4-19 03:30:55 "

eye . I am Optimus Prime , and I send this message to any surviving \ 
Autobots taking refuge among the stars : We are here . We are waiting .

Imagine a place you can always escape to\ 
An island off the coast of nowhere\

Blue tree tops and < PROPFEMALE > skies\ 
Blue ready to blow your mind\ 
Oooo\ 
This is a place where your mind can escape\ 
All the problems today and go far , far away\ 
This is a time with no history Welcome to mystery 
The whole value of solitude depends upon one's self ; it may be a \ 
sanctuary or a prison , a haven of repose or a place of punishment , a \ 
heaven or hell , as we ourselves make it .

Tired and my ears hurt from stretching them .... kinda bored too ........... what to do what to do . 
I'm not a stranger\

With crippled anger\ 
And tears that still drip sore\ 
A fragile frame aged\ 
With misery\ 
And when our eyes meet\ 
I know you see\ 
I do not want to be afraid\ 
I do not want to die inside just to breathe in\ 
I'm tired of feeling so numb\ 
Relief exists I find it when\
