So sorry for the families of the Metro rail victims in D.C. I remember the 1982 Metro crash underground the day Air Florida crashed into the 14th St Bridge . My prayers go out to all involved in this -- rescuers , families , friends . 

I can't believe < PROPFIRST > Mays is dead !!! My son < PROPMALE > and I were just doing < PROPFIRST > Mays impressions only yesterday !! 
Mrs. Henderson also said , \Don't stir up the manure pile ! \"" 
Gray < PROPFEMALE > can be my profile picture for a little while . She is a good girl . 
Beautiful weekend- we had a great time at Harborfest yesterday . The new Town Point Park is beautiful . 
What a great Harborfest weekend ! < PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > surprised everybody by actually being able to stand up on their boat in the Sikaflex Build-A-Boat contest and they never capsized !! See my photos . 
We are very thankful for an answered prayer today . 
We had a nice long weekend visiting my parents in Bowie , < PROPFEMALE > , painting their family room and kitchen , a side-trip to Annapolis yesterday , and a visit to the Norfolk Botanical Gardens today while the rest of you were at work !! 
I have nothing to say . Stop the clocks . 
It is finally HOT outside . Beach anyone ? I am fading fast and it may turn into air conditioning and a nap . 
It is raining cows and chickens at my house . Moo ! 
I am THANKING GOD for blessing me with FOUR wonderful years of marriage to the best man He could have picked for me . I love you so much , < PROPFIRST > ! Happy wedding anniversary ! 
Joke my mom sent me : What is the difference between a catfish and a lawyer ? One is a bottom-dwelling , scum-sucking scavenger and the other is a fish ! 
Busy weekend - < PROPFIRST > has become the flea market < PROPMALE > ! You need it , he's got it ! 
< PROPFIRST > started his first college classes today . Seems like I was just there myself ! 
is grateful to < PROPFIRST > for a double-gift today : organizing the linen closet AND cleaning the fridge . 
What a rainstorm !! Lightning hit close to our house . Last night we were at the Oceanfront and the waves were incredible . Lots of people in the water though and I later heard they closed beaches to swimmers after a 3pm riptide . We saw one lifeguard sitting on his chair with his floatee and were wondering why the heck he was there after 5 , so we named him The Codependent Lifeguard . Great band name , don't you think ? 
I went to the Oceanfront for the sunrise this morning . Me , 7-11 coffee and those hostess powdered sugar doughnuts , and about 50 people who annoyed me by taking up space on MY beach ! :) You would think I own the place . Lots of surfers though that I enjoyed watching . The waves had died down a bit but were still much better than usual for surfing . 
is sad to see a former client sentenced to five years this week . It is a long story and without knowing it you would not have sympathy for him because he is a sex offender . But I tell you there is much more to this than you will read in the paper . People are not always what they seem -- good or bad -- but we so like to villify those who are easy to judge and think ourselves better . Justice -- what is it ? 
< PROPMALE>'s Dominion is not what it used to be . Paramount sold it and the new owners are cutting way too many corners . There were NO SHOWS yesterday -- an August Saturday for < PROPMALE>'s sake . It isn't as clean . The ice cream place was even closed ! Attendance seemed really low for a summer Saturday . But never fear : I did get my strawberry funnel cake . I'll spend my money at Busch Gardens from now on . 
What's with the extremely annoying \Hidden From News Feed\ " popup that is plaguing me tonight on Facebook ??? I hope it is some kind of fluke that will not be there again . " 
I'm thinking of my brother < PROPMALE > , his wife < PROPFIRST > , her mom , < PROPFEMALE > , and their family , as they say goodbye to < PROPFEMALE>'s dear husband < PROPMALE > who left this life on September 1st , unexpectedly , at age 64 . Go with God , < PROPMALE > . You are missed . 
thinks there is something wrong with the Facebook news feed today . It has been out of order at times and seems to be caught in a loop and can't go to older posts . Oh well . I guess everybody has an off day now and then . 
One for whom a pebble has value will find beauty wherever he goes . 
< PROPFIRST > and I made an awesome Peach Cobbler tonight using the new Kitchen-Aid mixer < PROPFIRST > got me , and the peaches we got in N.C. with < PROPFIRST > & < PROPFIRST > that we had frozen . Peachy yummy goodness !! Should have taken a picture . 
took a long walk at the Oceanfront tonight and enjoyed snapping photos for three groups of beach visitors -- four Indian ladies , four golf buddies , and a very pregnant couple . What joy !!! 
& hearts ; 
It worked !!! < PROPFEMALE > taught me how to do hearts !!!! & hearts ; 
< PROPFIRST > will be arriving home from Costa Rica tomorrow evening and I can hardly wait !!! <3 <3 <3 
Yikes ! I think the National Parks series is running for consecutive nights . I'm not available ! I was ready to devote my Sundays for the next 6 weeks . Boo hoo . But it is the BEST TV I've seen in ages . 
The National Parks : night #2 . & hearts ; Yellowstone , Yosemite , Sequoia , Mesa Verde , Everglades , Mt . Ranier , Grand Canyon . Did I miss any ? Plus , I decided < PROPFIRST > resembles < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > . Just more reason to love him ! 
Had a wonderful evening with the Popular Girls Book Club . Thanks , ladies . for being so smart , funny , and warm ! No wonder you are popular ! 
Walked through all 12 Homearama homes in Chesapeake today with < PROPFEMALE > . Whew ! 
Zombieland was fun last night . Those girls definitely showed an unusual lapse in judgment when they turned on the lights at the amusement park . 
What if , just what if -- my world was uncluttered . Would it be peaceful and calm , or would I just yearn to muss it up again ? 
is headed for an old-fashioned hymn singing at church tonight , after a long day of successfully selling stuff in our driveway ! 
This is the most beautiful autumn I have seen in Va Beach since moving here . We took a lovely autumn hike through the Norfolk Botanical Gardens today . 
is glad that Norm Stein's back surgery went well today . And also glad that our little granddaughter Maddy is sleeping soundly in the next room . Praying that < PROPFIRST > drives safely home from a concert in Richmond tonight . 
got lots of exercise helping with the tic-tac-toe game at Kempsville Presbyterian's \Harvest Hoedown\ " tonight . Imagine picking up eight cardboard Xs and Os off the concrete every 30 seconds for two straight hours . The kids and families seemed to have fun and there were tons of < PROPFEMALE >." 
Ah , but dear < PROPFIRST > has the flu or something similar . I can hear him coughing upstairs . 
The flu is departing the premises and , so far , I have acquired no symptoms ! < PROPFIRST > is feeling better . 
had a nice visit with her mom and dad in Richmond today . We celebrated Mom's 72nd b-day with dinner at < PROPFIRST>'s . < PROPFIRST > shared new music with us on the journey : < PROPMALE > Coulton -- excellent and clever musician -- check out his website before he gets too famous . Still some free music there .

Still waiting for power to come back on in the Fairfield neighborhood of Kempsville/Virginia Beach . A hot shower sounds really good now !! 
The Moore's house is electrified once more ! Thanks , < PROPFEMALE > Power ! Good work this time . 
Thank you , God , for the beautiful sunshine today . Lots of folks in Va Beach raking , bagging , cutting , hauling , wringing , and drying . 
saw As You Like It on stage at Regent University tonight and laughed and laughed . They were faithful to Shakespeare's text but put the play in a modern setting complete with video , Rock Band , and cell phone texting ! The acting was flawless ! What a bargain -- < PROPFEMALE > Beach's best kept entertainment secret . Professional theater for the price of a movie ! 
What is the distinction between Status Updates and News Feed ? Can someone enlighten me ? 
is settling cases this week . That should make some space in my trial calender for early 2010 ! 
After reviewing tonight's FB , the verdict is in : Most people reporting had a tough day today , or at least an unusually tiring one . 90 percent of precincts in . Better day tomorrow , folks !! I think the < PROPFEMALE > was full last night . 
My beautiful and cozy study is still neat and clean !!! I feel like I just bought a new room ! Now , er , for the rest of the house . . . . 
We probably won't get snow here in < PROPFEMALE > Beach , but if we do , I have a snowshovel and a sled !!! 
Shepherds . Watching those flocks by night . 
A great night for Shepherds !!! Joy , Joy , Joy !!! 
Sitting by the fire , Christmas tree twinkling , dear < PROPFIRST > on the couch with me , watching a < PROPMALE > Brokaw documentary on my favorite place : Yellowstone National Park . 
Peace on Earth , good will toward men , except for the son of a b who tried to blow up a Northwest Airlines plane today . Light him up like a tree -- I think that's what he wanted . 
Saturday morning after Christmas . Coffee and paper with my < PROPFEMALE > . Relaxin ' to new music . Trying to decide how to spend this luscious day . Thinking warm thoughts of all my FB friends . 
Back from the mall . Went just to walk around and see the crazy people . Yep , they were there . Not many bargains . Now home and ready for a nap !! 
Ok everybody ! Retro week is over ! Starting now , post as your profile picture a fictional character that you think best represents your personality . Be creative ! Copy and paste this so we can all play along 
< PROPMALE > A . Smith : I have been to the Y to exercise and am checking Facebook before bed . Oh yes , drinking a Tropical Smoothie . Mango Moxie with Splenda and soy protein , to be precise . Knew you would want to know . 
Beautiful snow outside my window . We know how to do snow here in < PROPFEMALE > Beach ; we schedule it for the weekend !!!! 
There's a Tulloh in my house !!!! 
I awoke to snow coming down , snow on the ground , coming down fast , snow isn't gonna last ( long ) . 
I am resisting the urge to defend my professional reputation . I'm thinking my reputation speaks for itself and I should remain silent until the appropriate moment . My heart burns hot within me ! 
is having a very happy 50th birthday . Mr. Sun even decided to come out from behind the rainclouds for a bit . And to whomever sent the deliciously beautiful fruit arrangement , thank you !! 
My beautiful first-born , < PROPFEMALE > , is 21 today ! She is an example of my best work . 
A good day for the Norfolk Botanical Gardens ! 
It is All Good . 
Winter popped in for a visit in < PROPFEMALE > Beach . The welcome mat has been PULLED off of my front porch !! Go away , Old Man !!!! 
Tonight I am reflecting on the Cross -- the Sacrifice of Christ . It makes Resurrection morning all the more joyful ! 
\I'm here to sing . \ " - Little < PROPFIRST > " 
If this ain't the mess , it'll do until the mess gets here .

Who made a car in 2009 that allows stupid owners to leave the headlights on adn drain the battery ? Volkswagen , that's who . They give their owners more credit than I deserve . Really .

All right , but apart from the sanitation , medicine , education , wine , \ 
public order , irrigation , roads , the fresh water system and public \ 
health , what have the Romans ever done for us ? 
Life is short . Grace . Peace . Love . 
Today , will you add goodness to the world , or subtract ? Be somebody's blessing . 
I missed the Norfolk Beerfest AND the Norfolk Greek Festival . ( Frown ) . BUT , I had a lovely weekend hosting a visit from my dear friend Kamila and her two beautiful children , < PROPMALE > and Katana . ( Big Smile ) . <3 <3 <3 
Slept in today after a very tiring week . 
Weeds . In the garden . On my kitchen table ( figuratively speaking ) . In my thoughts . Time to pull ' em !!! 
I'm going to try to < PROPFEMALE > my cross this week instead of leaving it in the room over the garage . Thanks for the reminder , Dr. < PROPMALE > ! 
I don't know . Am I supposed to be doing or saying something ? Just consider me clueless at this point . 
Having a nice dinner with the family in honor of Father's Day . My wonderful inlaws are in town !! 
Just because you can't see it doesn't mean it isn't real . 
Tomatoes , Zinnias , Yellow Squash , Green Peppers , Eggplant , Mosquitos . What's in YOUR garden ?

enjoyed the fireworks in our Nation's Capital last night . The best part was we made it out of town by Metro and got back to my parents in Bowie by 11 pm !! It was a small miracle . 
if\ 
you have a wonderful man , who works hard to take care of you , would do \ 
anything for you , who makes you laugh , is your best friend , who wants to\ 
grow old with you , will always pick you up when you're down , who is \ 
your world , is someone that you're thankful for , then post this to your \ 
status , & give the good men the recognition they deserve , because \ 
great men are rare ! 
Yes , it's the Jesus thing . They really enforce that rule .

The most wonderful thing about Tiggers is - I'm the only one ! You heard that right !!! 
The darkness doesn't stand a < PROPMALE > against the light . 
What is the meaning of your life ? Does your life have a purpose ? Is Truth important ?

If cleanliness is next to Godliness , then my house is located midway between heaven and hell , but RISING !!!!

purchased the first Christmas gift of the year today -- and it is perfect !! 
I love FB because it offers a place to share glimpses of the simple joys in the lives of people I care about . Thank you , friends ! 
< PROPFIRST > and I had a lovely weekend exploring < PROPFEMALE>'s Eastern Shore . Assateague was beautiful but the mosquitos were a little too happy to see us . 
Felt like the first day of Fall around here -- gray , heavy clouds , cool weather . Kind of a melancholy feel to it . Nobody's on the road , nobody's on the beach . 
Which Muppet are you ? -- My Result : < PROPMALE > the Frog . http://quizme.heroku.com/quizzes/33271/referrals/status?aid=215500293 
Felt like the first day of Fall around here -- gray , heavy clouds , cool weather . Kind of a melancholy feel to it . Nobody's on the road , nobody's on the beach . 
How come my posts never make the Top News feed ? I choose to believe it is my uniqueness . . . . 
Oh how I dread that long , slow march into the realm of long winter nights . Come back soon , summer !! 
Hurricane < PROPMALE > ??????? 
You don't hear the crabs and oysters complaining about tropical storms and hurricanes do you ? DO YOU ????? 
Really enjoyed The Tramps , The Village People , and especially Ms. < PROPFEMALE > Gaynor last night on the beach at the American Music Festival . What a great time !!! I was up WAY past my bedtime ! 
Going to fight . . . for my right . . . to p-a-r-t-y tonight . Well , 25 or 6 to 4 or so . 
< PROPMALE > McClinton and Chicago were great last night under the stars on the sand . Tonight : R.E.O. Speedwagon and < PROPFIRST > Benatar !!! 
Although the day is drop-dead gorgeous , I have those last day of summer weekend doldrums . Price to pay for a wonderful concert weekend I guess . 
Hey , this week is almost half over , isn't it ? 
Nice weekend with my parents visiting from < PROPFEMALE > . 
For the life of me I can't recall which classmate posted earlier this summer that he wanted to find a law job back in VB . GEICO has an opening , FYI . Check < PROPFEMALE > Lawyer's Weekly or the geico.com . 
< PROPFIRST > turns 20 tomorrow . I have no teenagers anymore after tonight . < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > are even better young adults ! 
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz . . . . 
Came home for lunch and enjoying the screen porch ( key word is SCREEN ) and it has cost me at least three mosquito bites on my feet and ankles . What's up with that ? Decision : Benadryl ? Or be awake at my desk this afternoon ? 
I like it on the kitchen chair . Or sometimes on the staircase . 
Had a fun evening with some wonderful friends . Thank you < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > . Oh , mustn't forget < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > , those brave men who are such good sports . 
Lunch with my cousin < PROPFEMALE > tomorrow at Shockoe Bottom in Richmond . Leaving < PROPFIRST > home to do his yard sale thing . He has a couple of kayaks to sell so he will be in his driveway pitchman element . He says he sells all so that I can park in my garage again . 
Monday , Monday , so good to me . Monday morning , be all I hope you would be . 
I love the new feature on FB that shows you a couple of your previously posted photos . A nice reminder to review those happy times ! I miss Yellowstone with MBM , < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFIRST > . <3 <3 <3 
Now\ 
I'm not sayin ' the economy is BAD .... but yesterday in the post office \ 
window there was a poster that read \man wanted for murder\ " ....... and 5 \ 
on the kitchen chair or the staircase . 
I know I'm gonna make you all mad but . . . \ 
here comes Christmas . 
Happy 10-10-10 . I think you are a perfect 10 . 
Grumpy . 
Have you hugged your Helper Monkey today ? 
Enjoyed seeing old and new friends at the < PROPFEMALE > conference at The Homestead . 
In the fall time , the autumn leaves , fall from branches off the trees . . . whirly twirly , whirly twirly in the air . Whirly twirly whirly twirly every where . Thank you to my kindergarten teacher , Mrs. < PROPMALE > , for teaching me this song that sticks with me to this day . 
I am rejoicing with all the new passers of the < PROPFEMALE > Bar Exam -- CONGRATULATIONS on a < PROPMALE > hurdle jumped !! 
Hope the kids are outrunning the zombies tonight . I always suspected Ghent was where the zombie apocalypse would begin . 
Please\ 
put this on your status if you know someone or are related to someone \ 
who suffers from stupidity . People need to understand that stupidity is \ 
real and should be taken seriously . You could be sitting next to a \ 
sufferer right now . There is still no known cure for stupidity \ 
and ... sympathy does not help , but we can raise awareness . 93% won't copy\ 
and paste this , because they don't know how to copy and paste . 
< PROPFIRST>'s yard sale to raise funds for his Haiti relief trip is doing very well ! Plus getting all that stuff out of the garage . :) Like !!! 
For those who romanticize the past , remember : Politics has always been brutal , men have always been vicious , and we have always needed the gospel . Moreover , our ultimate hope has never been , and will never be in the election of a man , but in the return of the God-Man . So cast your vote for decent candidates ( there is none good but God ) . . . but place your hope in Christ . -- Voddie Baucham 
Life is mostly froth and bubble , \ 
Two things stand like stone , \ 
Kindness in another's trouble , \ 
Courage in your own . \

Saw Last Night of Ballyhoo at Regent University studio theater tonight -- EXCELLENT play , well done , wonderful actors !!

lifetime ! 
Taking the day off and spending it in the sunshine ( hopefully ) with my favorite person in the whole world !!!!

< PROPFIRST > Moore is in Miami and will be home tomorrow , Lord willing !!!!

Birthday Error Message : There is no going back . 
If you go out in a heavy thunderstorm , might your whole outing be a big mistake ? 
I'm preparing to work on one of life's certainties . Happily , it's not death .
