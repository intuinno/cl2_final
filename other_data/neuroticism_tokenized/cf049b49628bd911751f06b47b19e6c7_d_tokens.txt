Aaaaaand there goes my entire newsfeed . -.- 

Putting on my bright yellow polo and heading out to my secret base in Stop n Shop , where I will soon be terrorizing the speed charts and packing groceries like a boss . D:< 
Maaaaaan , today's the last day of vaca- Wait , nevermind , I go to the Voke , we've got more time . ;D 
Well , after about a year or so of constant nagging to my mom , I finally got one of these monstrocities . And within just a few minutes , I got hordes of people talking to me ...... I feel loved ? :D 
So I just found SOOO many people I lost contact with , and chatted them . This day is officially AWESOME . <3 
So yeah , < PROPMALE > Byrnes is super-special-awesome and I can only HOPE I'll ever be as awesome as he is . :3 <3 ( EAT IT , < PROPMALE >!) 
Alright , it's 10 at night , and I REALLY need to pee .... but my bed's far too comfy and I don't wanna put pants on .... GAH , desisions ! DX 
Can't sleep ..... someone sing me a lullabye ? :D <3 
Just got done making some mean paprika scrambled eggs . :D 
Poke wars with old buddies FOR THE WIN !!!! <3 :D 
was forced to watch the < PROPFEMALE > Montana movie in Spanish today .... WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE . 
My metaphorical arm should be bruised and bleeding from all these pokes . XD Note to anyone I'm currently in a poke war with : YOU'RE GOING DOWN . 
Was JUST about to upload a drawing and the Breakheart pics .... then Mother Nature denied me and turned my power off the SECOND I got to the FB < PROPFEMALE > after hours of waiting for my infected computer to open up ..... thanks , MN , thanks . D:< 
So I kinda have a random urge to play Devil May Cry 3 right now ... and I can't .... and it's kinda depressing . XD 
Just found out we're getting the new computer ... and they put Photoshop AND Elements on it ! TwT 
Had to watch < PROPFEMALE > Montana again ..... on the upside , it made for some interesting conversation in Related . XD 
Just got 5 gold stars on RB singing Don't Fear the Reaper AND Foreplay Long Time . Accomplishment reached . <3 
SO YEAH , < PROPFEMALE > PAG AND < PROPFEMALE > MCTILLI NEED TO ACCEPT MY FRIEND REQUESTS SO I CAN TAG THEM IN THE BH ALBUM . >:O 
Like this and I'll wall you , just cuz we can . :P And cuz I might as well , lol . 
I'm not addicted to Facebook , I'm addicted to the people on it . <3 
FINALLY finished Zombieland . TALLAHASSEE IS THE MAN ! :D <3 
Fortune cookies say : \An exciting opportunity lies ahead if you are not timid\ " and \ " Act boldly and unseen forces will come to your aid . \ " Something to look forward to ? <3 " 
has some EPIC plans in motion for the 19th !!! :D <3 
I hate it when something that shouldn't bug me , does , and makes me rethink every single thing I feel . :/ 
The heart has reasons of which reason knows nothing . <3 
Gonna go crush some hopes and dreams in GH5 online . \ForeverGon\ " ( Expert ) on Wii if you wanna join . :P " 
What's one to do when one's friend needs help , but there's nothing one can do to help , no matter how much they want to ...? 
Has the \sudden\ " urge to play ToS now . " 
Hmmm ... somebody help me pic which one to play : ToS , PoP , or GH5 . :D 
RAWR , it's raining . <3 Hopefully my hair stays moderately straight , haha . Shop where I'll be painting Lam all day . :D 
SO , I should probably play some nonstop Guitar Hero soon in preparation for the battle tomorrow ... but at the same time , should probably play Tales so < PROPFIRST > doesn't capslock at me .... GAH ! 
Has a MASSIVE headache ... probably from staring at a TV/computer/PSP screen all day . XD 
ATTENTION ALL DV11 BUDDIES : You're getting hugs tomorrow whether you like it or not . :D <3 
Last day of shop = party , food , Wii , Xbox , and massive destruction of brain cells ? I believe so . GOODBYYEEE , < PROPMALE > YEAR DV , HELLOOO , MR . MCCREADY ! <3 
Guitar Hero Results : 2 losses , 2 wins ... TIE . My rematch senses are tingling . :D 
Gotta love the way color unexpectedly moves around when you're painting . :D <3 Lam's looking pretty fine right now , haha . 
So apparenty my amp can pick up different/strange frequencies , cuz there are faint voices coming out of it , and it's not my guitar or music . O.O 
Gotta wait ' til tomorrow to do more painting . :S \ 
White Gouache : 1\ 
Andrea : 0 
Have you ever noticed that puckered lips are shaped like a heart ? <3 
So I'm realizing I should probably start talking to the DV freshies more often . Only one more year with them , I might as well have fun with them while it lasts . :) <3 
The truth is that we hide so we can be found , we walk away to see who will follow , we cry to see who will wipe away our tears , and we let our hearts get broken to see who will fix them . <3 
So I'm REALLY bored , and feeling pretty good , so here's the deal : Ask me ANYTHING , either in a comment or on my wall , and I will answer with 100% . But it only lasts ' til I go to bed , and if you abuse this < PROPMALE > , then I won't answer . GO ! :D 
I've been trying too hard - can't get you out of my mind . And if this is how it has to be , just promise you won't forget me , and I'll leave you with this lullabye tonight . <3 G'night , Facebook . :) 
Walking home , I realized that my neighbor's loud Spanish music's really not that bad . Not for the music itself , but because when you can smell the barbeque and see the children dancing to it ... you know summer's just around the corner . <3 
So I kinda sorta REALLY hate it when you're two steps away from a save point , then you die , causing you to do it all over again . D: Atleast cutscenes are somewhat skippable ... 
Anybody want me to draw them a graffiti ? :D Just comment with that you want and I'll put one up for you when I can ::: My midnight garden is filled with the shillouettes of roses I one day hope to give to you . <3 
And if I walked away tonight , never to return , would you < PROPMALE > after me ? Or would you never even notice ... 
You know what I hate the most about you ? Your beautiful eyes , smile , the way you laugh , the way you talk , the way you care , the way you act when nobody else is around . I hate how you stole my heart enough to make all my statuses about you ... I hate that I love you . 
All I'm asking for is ONE favor before you go off and leave : Look me straight in the eyes , and don't look away until you know for a FACT that you won't miss what's standing infront of you . 
I apologize ahead of time for this , but * ahem * THE GAME , YOU ALL JUST LOST IT . <3 
Uggghhh , up early for another pointless day of school . Note to faculty : Yes , actually , there IS such a thing as too many movies . =.=; 
Mmmmm , just cuz I can , Im'ma do that first impression thing . <3 Like this status , I'll post on your wall , blah blah blah , you know the drill . :P 
Just heard somebody blaring Metallica's \Sad But True\ " out their car ... and it kinda makes my day whenever I hear that in < PROPFEMALE > . XD\ 
Just look in my eyes : they'll speak all the words my heart never found the moment to say outloud . </3 
Absolutely LOVES sitting on a windowsill freshly showered , listening to the birds sing while curtains float in the breeze around me . <3 Rule 32 : Enjoy the little things . ;D 
Sick of school and some people in it at this point . I don't care about attendance record , I wanna stay home where I have something better to do than staring at walls and being ignored , uggggghhh !!!!! D ' : < 
So here's the deal : 15 LIKES BY THE END OF TODAY , AND I , < PROPFIRST > TROCHIMIAK , WILL WEAR A DRESS TO SCHOOL TOMORROW . :O 
So out of curiosity , how many people actually WANT to see the dress , and didn't just like that status for the hell of it ? O.o Can't wait to see all your faces tomorrow , haha . <3 
I think it's about time that people learned that I AM ME . I love my friends more than myself , and would do anything to make them happy . <3 I have a deep hatred for the people who hurt them , and I'm not afraid to show it . You can love me or hate me , take me or leave me , but I really don't care . I'm < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Trochimiak , and I'm here to stay . <3 
One last random thought before I go to sleep : Should I be worried that the same prostitute , has taken the time to find and friend me , with NO mutual friends , MULTIPLE times ? O.O 
Has officially got her pahr-tay dress on , lol . ;D Last day of school , then hanging at Kriss and < PROPFEMALE>'s houses . \ 
WOOOO , SENIOR YEAR GUYS , WE MADE IT ! <3 
Had an AMAZING day today . <3 I feel so much better about a few things that've been on my mind , and summer's only just begun . <3 Although , I'm gonna miss some people from shop and friends ..... hell I MISS YOU GUYS ALREADY !!! : ' O 
Is in an INSANELY AWESOME mood right now . <3 <3 <3 The only thing that could make this better would be laying on a blanket under candlelight in the back yard overlooking the city ......... but we've got skunks . XD 
LOL , MUM'S USING MY CHAT TO TALK TO MY FRIENDS , BE WARNED . XD <3 
Getting ready for some pretty amazing people to come over . :D <3 Summer's gonna start off with quite a bang . <3 
So I kinda hate it when I get fairly far in ToS and there are no near save points , causing me to die and do it over again . D: \ 
Today marks the first day of saving for a 360 . Any recommended games/info I need to know ? O.o ( Gears and L4D2 are already in that list from < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > , lol . ) 
BRAWL SUPER SUDDEN DEATH , 99 MINUTES WITH < PROPMALE > , BR < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > , HECTIOR AND < PROPFIRST > , FOR THE MOST EPIC WIN EVER !!!!! :D <3 
< PROPFIRST > amaya is a god in smash bros . 
Had an amazing first full day of summer , I missed you guzs SOOOO much , despite my bout with shyness at the beginning . Youz . Are . AWESOME . <3 
Agreement with parents : If I get the 360 , the old computer moniter is mine for the taking , and it can go in my room forever ..... this is looking to be an AWESOME summer . <3 
Plans for today : Shower , video games , < PROPFEMALE > wiff mah Fasha , transfer important files , hopefully getting the new computer up and running , more video games , dinner wiff mah Fasha , come home , test Photoshop , then fall asleep to the summer breeze . Today's looookiiing GOOD . <3 
SO , according to my doctor , I was 160 lbs and overweight last year . One year later , I stepped on the scale , and am happy to say I feel good about my body : 135 , BABY , WOOOOOOO ~ ! :D <3 This day just got so much better , lol . 
Up this early on a summer Monday for a day of work ?..... this 360 is worth it . Sooo tiiiired =.= 
I think I would've enjoyed laying under the stars , < PROPFEMALE > , and candlelight to be more enjoyable if I didn't come back inside to find mosquito bites on my butt . O.o 
Gotta love the feeling of victory . :) Mess with the ones I love and you mess with ME . <3 
Smells of my pomegranite shampoo , mint chocolate soap , and muffins are floating through the house right now . <3 Still working on Thursday plans ~ 
So after punching in the < PROPFIRST > , I've got about sixty or seventy bucks saved right now , made about foutry-something in work yesterday , and with getting that much again on Friday and Saturday night hits week ( hopefully ) ...... I should have enough for a 360 by the end of the week ! EPIC WIN !!!! :D <3 <3 
Reflecting on the past month or so , I've realized something : Being assertive and standing up for myself and the ones I love is not only an amazing feeling , but HELLA FUN AS WELL . :D Oh the joys of proving people wrong and walking away . <3 
Can't really think of anything to draw ... any suggestions ? :D <3 
Stealing this from < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Aguilluz cuz I can , lol . <3 When and how did we meet ? Copy and paste this as your status and see what stories you get ~ ! ;P 
Sitting here wishing Thursday would get here already . <3 It hasn't even been a week and I miss them already . :P 
Freshly showered , eating some animal crackers , and overlooking a veiw spanning from the harbor islands , < PROPFIRST > airport , Easp Boston , < PROPFEMALE > , Bostin , the tobin , and the endless blue sky above it . Today's gonna be another good day . <3 <3 
Y'know , you wouldn't think that Axe Twist bodyspray and Dove pomegranite deoderant would smell good together , but .... wow , it's AMAZING !!! :O <3 
So yeah ... I kinda miss you . But as long as you're happy , I'm willing to miss you until we meet again . Cuz I can live without you .... I just don't want to . <3 
< PROPFEMALE>'s here and in less than 5 minutes , we're mocking little children , and scratching eachothers itches . O.o Can't wait til tomorrow . :D <3 \ 
\ 
BTW , < PROPFEMALE > just told Moshi it's awesome , and it kinda yelled at her . XD 
My shirt : \Keep staring at me ! \ " \ 
AMAZING day todaaaaayy ~ ! :D Bunch of people couldn't make it , but it was fun all the same . Ah , the joys of pomegranite , huggles , SSBB , and putting pigtails in < PROPMALE>'s hair . XD <3 
After laying down and feeling my freshly washed n ' extremely soft ( lol , kinda-sorta-not-really rhyme ) on my back , I've realized something : I miss my old butt-long hair . TIME TO GROW IT OUT AGAIN . <3 
Y'know , at one point , the sight of your name thrilled me in a way that's hard to describe . Now ... that's gone . The feeling's gone .... but I don't dare say why . 
So I'm going in for work at 12 , even though my shift starts at 6 . Getting back around eleven tonight , too .... remember the 360 , remember the 360 ... 
Watching Yugioh ! Abridged ' til mum picks me up . XD Hopefully that'll be later than twelve . O.o 
Tired , JUST got home , in a random bad mood . Funny how one little thing can ruin your WHOLE day . :( Ugh , going to bed , g'night . 
Is it strange to not want to be thought highly of ? I'm tired of people flattering me and making me feel like I'm high up when I don't wanna be ..... it's lonely up there . </3 
Kinda prepared for a bad day again . HOPING it's not , but prepared for it . >.<; Really don't wanna go back in today . :S 
K , so maybe toay's not looking so bad after all . :) Gotta focus on the good , there's no point in dwelling on something you can't change . Time to move on . <3 <3 
You know you've found a deoderant that FINALLY works when you sweat only a little after BEATING THROUGH THE FIRE AND THE FLAMES EXPERT !!!!!!! :DDDD <3 
Really thinks prostitutes should stop requesting me with no mutual friends . If I ignore you once , don't request me again . If I ignore you twice , don't request me again . If I block you , DON'T MAKE ANOTHER ACCOUNT AND TRY IT ALL OVER AGAIN . It's too late at night for this crap . =.=; 
I kinda forgot how much I used to love the original Yu-Gi-Oh ! ( not the game , the actual series ) . So comes the time to pull out all my manga and read it from the beginning again . :D <3 
Is over-thinking things again . :/ But you never know how strong you are until being strong is the only choice you have ... 
I'm done chasing something that's never gonna slow down . I've got better things to waste myself on . Let me know when you want me back in your life , cuz right now , I'm gone . <3 
SCREW 4KIDS , I HAVE SEASON ZERO . >:D 
Mmmmm , it's been far too long since I've been able to sink my bare feet into soft sand . <3 Back home drawing the Yamis on mah new canvas . :D 
I haven't laughed myself to tears in SO long ! X'D Just another reason to absolutely love Yu-Gi-Oh ! Abridged . :D <3 <3 
You're only as strong as you believe , and you're only as smart as you think . <3 Feeling pretty amazing right now . Feelig prettu STRONG . :) 
Or you could just completely forget about me , that's cool . No no , it's fine , I enjoy being lied to . Really , you can leave and I'll still be here . I mean , it's not like I'm starting to hate you or anything . :) 
Watching Cirque Du Soleil , Google-ing Yu-Gi-Oh ! Abridged quotes , and eating pomegranite : Enjoying the little things . <3 
Maaaaan , what I'd give to just start dancing in the summer breeze right now ..... without touching the ground . <3 To be weightless with all that bodily freedom ... just the mere THOUGHT of it has the ability to steal my breath away ~ 
Will hopefully be barging into Gamestop and demanding a 360 within the next week or so . :D The only problem is ....... hooking it up to the < PROPFEMALE > moniter is something I have no idea how to do . O.O ; 
This is what happens when you let a bored < PROPFIRST > on Facebok : Like this and I'll ATTEMPT to write a paragraph about you . No promises that it'll last 5 sentences , though . :P 
Just finished the Yu-Gi-Oh ! Millennium World series ( again ) in one day , and even though I already knew the answer , I still kinda ..... y'know ..... cried ....... DON'T JUDGE ME . <3 
IS THE PROUD OWNER OF AN XBOX 360 , FTW ! >:D 
I'm loving the fact that my Xbox avatar looks like a gothic elf with my hair . :D <3 Unfortunately , there is no black beanie to be found . D: 
First complaint on Mirror's Edge : Button actions in the tutorial are WAY to small for me to read , causing me to be a failure at a TUTORIAL . Could just be the TV , but it's starting to piss me off . -.-; 
HURRAH for finally being used to an Xbox controller , AKA , using 2 joysticks at once . XD <3 
I love how working night-shift has drastically changed my sleeping and eating patterns . :D Heading off to NY tomorrow , be back Monday . <3 
So , I've gotta go a few days without coming on here .... or playing Xbox .... or Wii .... or a computer in general ..... part of me wonders why I'm so excited to go in the first place . \ 
Answer : I'M REUNITING WITH MY LONG-LOST LOVE : THE SEGA < PROPFEMALE > . :D <3 
Home from bonfires , fireworks , laying under the stars , and catching fireflies . But as awesome as being in NY's back-country was .... nothing beats this small apartment called home . <3 
Have you ever found yourself smiling so much your face hurts , but you can't stop , so you try forcing it off with your hands , but you end up laughing at how stupid you must look , causing your face to hurt even more ? It's one of the best feelings in the world to realize they couldn't just forget you , either . <3 
Typing Lesson From < PROPFIRST > #1 : This , ' q ' , is a ' Q ' . This , ' g ' , is a ' G ' . They're seperate letters for a reason , learn your alphabet and stop making all your Gs into Qs , it's not that hard . 
Told my mum about the Gears options , and it's a clear yes ! :D So the list goes : F-F VGA adaptor , wireless thingy , speakers , Live , and Gears 2 , then probably playing with < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > for the rest of the summer . :) <3 
It's too hot to function at ANYTHING right now , lol . I dun want the Xbox/Wii/computer to overheat , and nobody good is online . :P Waiting for a few people and looking up quotes that describe my good mood .... cuz it's too hot to think of anything original . D: 
So apparently the F-F VGA adaptor I've been saving up for the past week was in the box the ENTIRE TIME ...... wow ..... just wow . XD <3 
I WOULD find a way to burn myself on a blender . DX\ 
He taught me how to trust myself , he taught me that I should love every flaw . He taught me that no matter what , I should just make a desicion and JUMP without regret . <3 
I love that feeling of accomplishment you get when you're playing Xbox and the achievement icon pops up . XD <3 
Woke up with the image of your face burned into my mind for the first time in months . So begin the dreams once more ... \ 
Does it mean something when the same person is in every single one of your dreams , and they always take the role of protector ? 
Plans for today : Shower , watch more Yu-Gi-Oh ! Abridged , play a little 360 , eat something unhealthy , take another shower , hopefully get my stuff transferred to the new comp , curse the weather , take another showe- 
Can't wait to get my speakers tomorrow . <3 I've been refusing to play Mirrors Edge or < PROPMALE > of Persia without them , haha . AND I'LL FINALLY BE ABLE TO HEAR MY ACHIEVEMENTS . >:D 
My best friends are like the family I got to choose . Sure we tend to piss eachother off , but the fact that we're still here should tell you something . I < PROPFEMALE > each of you so very much , and would not hesitate to throw myself infront of a bullet if it meant you were safe . I love you , and hold you all extremely close to my heart . I'm telling you , and I don't want you to forget that . EVER . <3 
Maaaaaaan , got so much to do today ! :D Getting my paycheck , new speakers for the Xbox , and just going places in general . Also I need a dress .... but the fact that I'm getting other stuff kinda overshadows that . XD <3 \ 
I missez < PROPFEMALE > Tucker , < PROPFEMALE > Pag , and Kriss < PROPMALE > so much ~ ! 
So I woke up this morning thinking I didn't have another dream ... yet here I am remembering bits and pieces throughout the day . I hope you know I can clearly see the ghost of you and I ... 
So I was UBER EXCITE getting home cuz I had bought a set of speakers for the Xbox cuz I refused to play without the sound before , and I wanted to hear the little achievement sound , so I RAN to my room and plugged it in .... only to find out that apparently , USB speakers that the Best Buy guy said would work .... DON'T . \ 
EXTREME SAD FACE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! D ' : * sniff * .... anybody know what speakers DO work ? 
Got a whole new list of bands to check out , giving me something to do for the next few days , haha . :D Work from 1 to 11 tomorrow , then heading out to Cape Cod on Saturday . I'll still hav FB , though , SO I CAN STILL TALK TO ALL YOU AMAZING PEOPLE ! D:< <3 RAWR , feel my epic lurve !!!! 
You've changed . I miss the person I used to be friends with . 
Hi , my name's < PROPFIRST > , and I sing along with violent music while showering with mint and coconut soap . :D <3 
THESE HICCUPS ARE PAINFUL ! DX Straightening my hair and getting ready for work soon . Last time I'll be going in for a couple weeks . :D <3 
I wish the Xbox Achievement window would pop up in the side of my vision whenever I do something amazing in real life . :D 
Having some pretty intense conversations with Kriss < PROPMALE > right about now . :D <3 Man , we should be getting graded for the essays we've been writing back and forth . XD 
So I'm JUST realizing that I never uploaded dress pics from the last day of school . :O 
No , actually , airplanes AREN'T shooting stars , and if you like the way it hurts , you wouldn't be complaining about it . 
I love how my dad and I are both sitting on the porch watching the rain and clouds spanning from Boston to the Harbor Islands , and we randomly started tapping beats onto the furniture simultaneously . :D <3 
SO , does anybody know where I can buy a Turtle Beach Xbox headset ? :O 
Can somebody please explain WHY the Turtle Beach headsets don't work before I go insane ?!!?? It's the ONLY way I know of so far to get sound out of the monitor ( unless somebody hsa a better idea . USB spekers do not work ) . \ 
And just cuz it's starting to anger me , and cuz I can : THE GAME . <3 .... so how many people miss me ? XD 
SO , people should totally accept my new sibling requests . :O DO IT IF YOU LOVE ME . 
HURRAH , going horseback riding for the first time tomorrow ! :D And I don't care what the horse is already called , i'm dubbing it Epona . * nod nod * 
Achievement Unlocked - 50G : Rode a horse for the first time , and was AWESOME at it . :D <3 
Going to bed so I can get up early enough for breakfast at the Wee Packet ( HEAVENLY FRENCH TOAST :O ) tomorrow morning . Should be getting home sometime after tomorrow morning , so talk to you then . G'night~ <3 
Is finally back home , laying down with Poochie on my butt . :D <3 Too bad it's hotter in the house than it is outside . 
Man , the one thing I DIDN'T miss about Chelsea : screaming children . Time for some 360 ? I think so . 
So , I just so happen to have a new idea : every time I finish cleaning my room , I'm gonna take a picture of it , and at the end of one year ( AKA , the time I may or may not have to move out for college ) , I'll put them all in order and see how much it's changed . <3 
I'm bored , so here's the deal : Like this status , and I'll write one ( or more if I can't decide :P ) of my favorite memories of us on your wall . <3 GO ! 
I miss last summer when I actually had something to draw . -.-; Bleeeeggghhh , maybe drawing my dreams will help both situations ? 
FINALLY has something to draw thanks to < PROPFIRST > McTilli Kerrigan and his awesome character designs . :D <3 
ORANGE < PROPFEMALE > . <3 Feels good to be drawing again . :) 
OLOLOLOLOL MANLY BUTT CAPES . G'night . 
Hi , my name's < PROPFIRST > , and I just had the strangest urge to get up and bellydance . O.o Too bad I haven't done it in a while , haha . Time for more practice . :P <3 
I really hate it when I'm drawing something awesome , and it's the first thing coming out good in a while .... then the legs screw me up . D: SCREW YOU , LEGS , SCREW YOU . 
< PROPMALE > trades whenever I'm bored from now on ? I think so . 
Roadhouse for mum's birthday , be back later tonight . :D Hopefully drawing or painting something after that ~ <3 
And I came here with a great little story of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you . You make me feel like I inspire the inspirational . <3 
Tough Desicion : Stay in my comfy bed rendered unable to sleep , oooooorrrr get up and turn my swag off ? D: 
Maaaaaan , today's going by so uneccessarily sloooooow . D: Watching X-Play with < PROPFIRST > ( does anybody else get annoyed by these Lego games ? ) , and maybe watching more Season Zero or Abridged after he leaves ? 
Is so bored that she just typed out her 400+ song playlist alphabetically . HURRAH for not having a life ! :D 
Eeeewwwwwwwuuuugggghhhh , that's got to be one of THE most disgusting things I've ever seen ! Bleeeeggghghm . DX 
So I've come to the conclusion that I enjoy drawing women more than men , and their legs and proportions come out better ... strange ? O.o 
Sometimes I hate it when I draw a REALLY good proportional underdrawing , only to realize that I still need clothes , eliminating the awesome detail . D: 
Is an insanely super-special-awesome mood right now !!! :D Few things could bring me down from this right now ~ <3 <3 <3 
My pillows could not be softer . My smile could not be wider . My mind could not be more at peace . My heart could not be beating any stronger . I feel filled , and in this moment , I could die happy , and experience eternal bliss . All because of you . <3 
Life wasn't meant to be wasted in unhappiness . If one window closes , open another one : break down the door . For happy are the ones who dream dreams and are willing to pay the price to make them come true . <3 
I'm smiling for no reason , laughing uncontrollaby , shivering in still air , skipping back and forth , jumping up and down , dancing to no beat , and singing to no tune . I'm going absolutely crazy , and nothing can bring me down . <3 
Is buying a new Sasuke wig after cashing my check , cuz I've realized I no longer have any complete cosplay outfits . D: \ 
So how many people are going to Anime Boston 2011 ? <3 
You can either waste your life drawing the lines , or you can live your life crossing them . Cuz there are people out there who would give anything to watch you fail , but if you choose not to follow their path , and instead make a trail of your own , the ones who truley matter are sure to follow . <3 
Randomly thinking about cosplaying Sasuke at AB11 , and I've come to a predicament : I've lost enough weight that I could easily get away with an open shirt binding for Shippuden , but ...... that Haruhi Suzumiya fangirl of mine might be there to tackle me to the ground and rape me ..... again . D: 
Hmmmm , counting everything out , if I get last weeks paycheck cashed , do well this week , and finally get paid for babysitting , I should have enough for a decent wig and sports tape , yet still have money for speakers . Meaning cosplay needs would be taken care of , and I could go straight to Live and Gears after ! :D 
Call me crazy , but all these bad pics make me look in the mirror 24/7 now . I don't usually look so horrid , do I ? D: 
Visit the realm of my heart and I will ask of you only one thing : bring a blanket . You're gonna want it when we're forgetting the world together . And the stars have never shined so bright . <3 
Is slowly falling asleep to the scent of perfume I forgot was on my pillow . G'night , world , sweet dreams ~ <3 
Mmmmm , had the best dream ever . Had trouble waking up , haha . <3 I've been in such a good mood even the nightmares can't touch this . ;D 
Well , I've got absolutely nothing to do , so here's the deal . \Like\ " this status and I'll write on your wall what I hope you never EVER change about yourself . GO ! :D " 
Why must today be going by so uneccessarily slow ? D: I guess I'll just fix and ink a pic so I can PS it later , that oughta cure this epic boredom , lol . <3 
Wasting the rest of my day away watching Season Zero . :D 
Domino's < PROPMALE > bowl , I finally have something productive to do , people to talk to , and it's beautiful out : this day just got even better . :D <3 
Achievement Unlocked - 50G : Enough money for a wireless adaptor AND Live membership ? I think so . >:D 
Watching Season Zero , inking a pic that's coming out better the second time around , and finishing off a bread bowl . <3 Work at 3 , but for some reason I'm actually looking forward to it . O.o 
SO , seeing as I might very well be getting a Live account by the end of next week , anybody wanna share their Gamertags with me ? Mine will be posted when it's official , but leave yous here and I'll write'em all down to add later . :D <3 AND IT'S STRAIGHT TO GEARS AFTER THAT . D:< 
Heading off to work soon , be back around eleven . <3 \ 
GAMERTAGS , PEOPLE , COMMENT WIFF THEM SO WE CAN LIVE . D:< 
Your sweet moonbeam : The smell of you in every single dream I dream . I knew when we collided , you're the one , I have decided , who's one of my kind ~ <3 
And you know I don't let anyone give up , failure's just not an option in my world . So if you're gonna sit here and tell me you hate the rain , don't expect me to tell you there won't be a rainbow after . 
Leaving for work around one , be back at midnight , so if anybody wants to chat then wait for me . Busy busy day . <3 
WOOOOO , home early ~ ! Watch out , Stop and Stop , < PROPFIRST > just beat the fastest full-time shopper , and it's only my first job and I'm a par t-t imer ! ;D 3 < 
Gaaaaaahhhh , okay , so maybe Live's gonna take another week . Stupid me and oweing my mum money . XD But I swear , I will be on Gears online very VERY soon ! D:< 
Suddenly I feel like punching someone in the face . O.o 
And I can go to sleep happy knowing that because I exist , someone else has a reason to smile . G'night~ <3 
Is kinda wishing I had a Strawberry - Watermelon coolatta right about now . But I suppose a pineapple popsicle will do . <3 
Hi , my name's < PROPFIRST > , and I've suddenly become addicted to Mini Babybels like they're some kind of drug . O.O 
I've been blaming myself for EVERYTHING recently , and I have no idea why ... did I somehow hurt somebody ? This feeling of guilt just won't go away . :( 
FINALLY got my answers . The truth never felt so good , and I'm ready to change for the better for all it's worth ! <3 
Our washing machine WOULD break at the exact moment I run out of clothes . O.O 
Woke up to the sound of my doorknob turning .... but nothing happened . O.o Now I'm scared to get up for a drink !!! D: 
Can't seem to fall asleep , I've got too much on the mind . Can I please have my wings now ? I could use an escape ... from everything right now . 
This one goes out to the lost , confused , and broken hearted : you're never alone . <3 
So < PROPFIRST>'s over and we found Smart Food from a couple years ago ..... and made the mistake of sniffing it . I almost cried . XD 
Been watching Mythbusters with < PROPFIRST > all day . My good mood seems to be coming back , cuz why feel sad when it's better to be AWESOME ? :D You can only fly if you take yourself lightly ~ <3 
Go ahead and TRY ruining this good mood , I DARE you . I gaurantee you won't . >:D 
Why waste time wanting to punch someone in the face when you can just be AWESOME INSTEAD ? D:< I find it amazing that someone always found a way to make my day at the exact moment I started thinkins like a downer . I love you guys so much ~ <3 
Woman came from Man's rib ; not from his feet to be walked on , not from his head to be superior , but from the SIDE to be EQUAL , under the ARM to be PROTECTED , and next to the HEART to be L.O.V.E.D. <3 
IS THE PROUD OWNER OF GEARS 2 , FTW ! D:< 
So Gears is undoubtably awesome , and I even got a bunch of headshots my first time playing . XD Now to play N3 a little longer ... cuz I get the feeling it's a bit like my ' FLIGHT ' idea , and I'm gonna be PISSED if it is . D:< 
So , watching The Colony . And honestly , I don't care if it's a TV show . If you invaded my turf , I'd beat the living crap out of you . Hide and spread supplies , don't go near dead pigs when you're trying to survive a biological disease ... these people are making so many mistakes it's not even funny . >.< 
Plans for today : Clean my monstrocity of a room , watch a little more Season Zero ( Yeah , I know it's been taking me a while . XD ) , and play a little Gears or N3 for the rest of the day . Looking gooooodddd ~ <3 
Well , N3 doesn't seem to be anything like FLIGHT after all . Which is strange , seeing as they sound pretty similar from the back-of-the-box summary . O.o But I'm not complaining , just means my game's gonna be even better when it comes out within the next 10 years ! XD <3 
You know I really like a game when I play ' til my eyes hurt and do amazingly well on only my second day of it . >:D 
Well , I just said something Dr. Phil-like to somebody in need of assistance . I guess my day is officially complete . XD\ 
.... scratch that , I still need to yell at an inanimate object for hurting me in some way , shape , or form . 
Off to work , be back around 3-4 for a little Xbox or something . I really oughta name it or something . XD <3 
FINALLY home . The only thing that got me through the day : 2 watermelon-strawberry coolattas with whipped cream . XD <3 \ 
Got mah paycheck , too . Finally getting the rest of my 360 gear next time I'm near Gamestop ? I think so . >:D 
Well , thanks for showing me where I stand , < PROPMALE > . Now if you don't mind , I'm leaving . Bye ~ <3 
Can you guys please NOT rape my homepage with this Jersey Shore crap ? Kthanks . 
Getting to bed soon so I can get up in enough time for Gamestop and work tomorrow . Getting Live , woooooo ~ ! :D <3 ...... * sniffle * ...... poor < PROPFEMALE > . D ' : 
\The robbed that smiles steals something from the theif . \ " - Othello ; Shakespeare . Well hell yeah . <3 " 
FINALLY home , and really wants to hook up Live , but can't yet . D: Maybe tomorrow , haha . But until then , getting addicted to Cupcake Pebbles . XD <3 
Hopefully getting Live up and running before heading to work today . Then playing all day tomorrow ? I think so . >:D 
Gamertag : ForeverGoneAndy . Add me and leave yours here so it's all in one conveniant spot , please ~ ! <3 \ 
Also , Y'ALL LIED . All the achievements are still active , so nyeh !! :P 
Fails to understand why N3 doesn't have an achievement for getting 500+ kills in one battle . O.o 
Finally home after some car troubles . So much for work getting out early . XD Playing some Xbox soon , probably ' til I conk ~ <3 
ASKAJADLFFFFFFF , IF I FIND OUT MY GEARS 2 IS PERMANENTALY DAMAGED ALL HELL WILL BREAK LOOSE IN THIS HOUSE !!!!! D:< 
Gah , well there goes my first copy of Gears . D: Getting a new one tomorrow with the little money I have left , though , haha . Maaaaaaaaan , and I was looking forward to Live with mah buddeh tonight . Sad Face . 
Plans for today : Gamestop for a new Gears 2 in a bit , then home and Live with friends for who knows how long . XD Hopefully getting the < PROPMALE > to watch ' From < PROPFIRST > With Love ' today , too . >:D 
Unless anybody else wants to play , done with Xbox today . My eyes hurt SO bad , haha . And of course my controller works correctly again AFTER extreme frustration with Gears . 
Man , just woke up ... can't remember falling asleep , though , haha . O.o Anywho , boredom strikes again . \Like\ " this status and I'll tell you everything I like about you . :D <3 " 
So I'm in the middle of watching From < PROPFIRST > With Love on my Xbox , and I get a party request . I , of course , thought it was an achievement , THEN realized you don't get those while watching DVDs . XD <3 
Yes , I LOVE random headaches that don't go away ! :D 
Really wishes the little kids across the street would stop screaming and running around naked . O.o ; 
Just got finished spray painting a mask . I'm really liking this .... time to find some old boards and start practicing some graffitti art ~ <3 
Well , I feel .... slightly ... less n00bish ... just a little . XD 
\Those who can laugh without cause have either found the true meaning of happiness .... or have gone stark raving mad . \ " ~ Norm Papernick . You're only as happy as you make your mind up to be ..... and my mind has been more than made . <3 " 
Horde with < PROPFIRST > , and feeling REALLY accomplished . I must've had atleast 60 kills and only 3 deaths . WOOO ~ <3 
Confidence comes not from always being right , but from not fearing to be wrong . For when there is no enemy within , the enemies outside cannot hurt you ~ <3 
Well if I didn't believe my skull was dented and bleeding before , that kinda proved it . O.O 
Booooorreddddddd . I need something productive to do , haha . I should probably start begging for the scanner to be put up so I can finally color that trade picture . XD 
Has come to a desicion : My hair will not be cut once more until it reaches my hips . Layer and bang trims , that's it . I WANT MY LONG FLOWY HAIR BACK ~ <3 
Thinks that the people who made Vampires Suck are geniuses . Period . I want to see this movie so bad ! XD 
REALLY needs to find a day to < PROPFEMALE > out before I go insane ... er . O.o Time to plan another day of video game and pizza failing at my house ? I think so . :D <3 
Gonna go straighten my hair so I can trim my layers and feathers . :D First step to growing my hair out : Trimming things myself so stylists don't have the < PROPMALE > to go overboard . XD 
* Phone rings*\ 
Me : Hullo ~ ? \ 
Mum ( to me ): Who is it ? \ 
Caller : THIS IS AN OLD MAN SPEAKING . \ 
Me ( to mum ): It's Krissy . \ 
XD <3 
I swear , the way some people act these days pisses me the hell off . 
Achievement Unlocked - 15G : Successfully scratched nose while playing Guitar Hero . \ 
Achievement Unlocked - 20G : CHAIR'D KRISSY'S CROTCH . XD 
So is my homepage gonna be raped with this Jersey Shore crap EVERY Thursday or what ? Dislike . \ 
Finally writing out my FLIGHT story ~ <3 
So this is how my paydays have been going for the past month or so now : Claim check > cash check > Gamestop > victory dance . <3 
I'm so pissed off I can't even think of a status to show how pissed off I am . O.o 
Mmm , gonna try to get myself into a good mood somehow . IDK how yet , but Im'ma try . Cuz why want to throw bricks at someone WHEN YOU CAN THROW CHAIRS INSTEAD ? <3 LOL , inside jokes . :D 
* Kid across the street starts yelling again ... *\ 
Me : Can I PLEASE yell something back ? D: \ 
Mum : No , he'll think it's funny . Point your Nerf gun at him , you bought it for a reason . \ 
There's only one defining difference between sucess and failure , I think , being that failure is not being to overcome a difficulty , and success being that no difficulty can overcome you . <3 
Is FINALLY Photoshopping the < PROPMALE > trade ~ !! :D <3 Feels good to be able to zoom in on the chest without Moore stalking it and making comments . Now it's just mum .... but she kinda understands . XD 
He's a good time , cowboy Casanova leaning up against the record machine . He looks like a cool drink of water , but he's candy-coated misery . He's the Devil in disguise , a snake with blue eyes , and he only comes out at night , gives you feelings that you don't wanna fight . You'd better run for your life ~ <3 
Is writing letters on people's walls , just cuz I can . XD \Like\ " this and maybe I'll do one for you ? " 
Is so confused .... are you ashamed of me or something ? I'm not even hurt or pissed anymore , just trying to wrap my mind around it . O.o 
SO , I'm bored . \Like\ " my state of boredom and I'll tell you what first comes to mind when I think of you . :D <3 " 
Has done nothing but play Gears and watch Whose Line Is It Anyways ? all day . No life ? I think so . XD 
Loves her friends . Simple as that . <3 
I love how the scent of homemade blackberry jam is filling the entire house . Life doesn't get much better than this ~ <3 
Is being raped with notifications , it's driving me insane !! DX 
Nothing feels quite as good as cold air on a freshly showered body ~ <3 
Never realized I could do stomache rolls ( bellydancing move ) before .... I feel pretty accomplished . XD 
So how many people would be completely and utterly shocked if I made an attempt to look like a girl this year ? O , o 
Three girls , one tent . ;D Haha , at < PROPFEMALE>'s house wiff < PROPFEMALE > , FTW ~ ! XD <3 
Finally home ! Had an awesome sleepover , got some new CDs from bands I've never heard of , and got ..... GIRLY ..... ISH ...... ( kinda ) ...... CLOTHES . < PROPFEMALE > GASP . :3 <3 
Heading out to the BU Center of Digital Arts open house soon ~ <3 Somehow , senior year and college doesn't stress me out anymore . :D 
Why SHOULDN'T life feel this good ? My dreams have never been more in reach ~ <3 
Fresh shower , comfy socks , pomegranate juice , and probably passing out soon . <3 Going to Friendly's tomorrow to celebrate with Bradley ~ 
Holy CRAP , I've never been so into a game before . Just about to beat Gears 2 , and I'm shaking in excitement !!! D:< 
WOOOOO , GEARS 2 IS CONQUEEEEERRREEEEDDDDD !!!! >:D 
I just lost track of how long I've been playing Xbox . My eyes hurt SO bad , haha . Maybe Friendly's will make it better ? :3 
Danny : Gears sucks , get Assassin's Creed ! \ 
Me : YOU TAKE THAT BACK . \ 
< PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > have created a monster . XD 
Won an Annex round , AND Guardian while leader . HELL YEAH . <3 
Leaving for work soon , I'll hopefully be back around eleven . Hopefully I can find as much motivation as I had last time ~ ? <3 
So next week's my last week of work , and the managers are actually BEGGING for me to stay . Looks like the Union'll just give me a suspended absence and let me come back in next summer . :O Meaning , first ever real-world job = < PROPMALE > SUCCESS . <3 
I so badley wanna go on ' The Colony ' and show them all the mistakes they've been making . Seriously , how many people would watch if I went on ? :O 
Really wishes that I could find a site stating the age restrictions for ' The Colony ' . I'll try DC again later , cuz I'm seriously considering signing up for a season . :O 
I have come to the conclusion that if Pretzel Twizzler M&Ms are ever created , I'd be one fat young lass . O.o 
FFFFFFFFFF , my heal just spazzed involuntarily . That's what I get for scraping the crap out of it with a fifty-something pound cart . O.o Gonna sleep now , G'night~ <3 
Can't sleep cuz my bed's having one of those \comfiness denied\ " kinda nights . D: I miss you . A lot . <3 " 
To everyone who posts chainmail : A little zombie girl is gonna come eat me or something if I don't repost this ? Cuz I'm sure a little ten-year-old stalks everyone's Facebook pages JUST to see if you reposted it on 10 other pages , cuz let's face it , dead ten-year-olds LOVE facebook . I mean , if I died in some horrible way , all you Facebook inhabiting teenagers are coming down with me . IT ALL MAKES SENSE TO ME NOW . 
Suddenly I'm in a REALLY bad mood . Trying to refrain from destroying my fist on a wall or something . 
In a somewhat better mood I guess . Though now I can't play 360 tonight . D: < PROPMALE > AND < PROPFIRST > , YOU HAVE MY APOLOGIES . <3 
So yeah , I'm probably gonna be working at Harmonix in say , 3 years . Write me ? Kthanks . :D <3 
I love how I'm physically incapable of being a < PROPFEMALE > Downer for more than a day , haha . But I also love my amazing friends and family who stick by me through everything and ALWAYS know how to make me smile on my worst days . < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPMALE > , Krissy : I love you guys so much ~ <3 
Needs to get to Gamestop ASAP ! D:< 
Two things : One , let me find out if I like something for myself , I honestly don't give a crap about reviews . Two , I don't respond to one word replies . That is all . :) 
Really really REALLY misses errone from shop , UBER BADLEY . D: <3 <3 
Has come to the conclusion that I'm kinda reluctant to going on Gears Live cuz I still suck . O.O ; Solution : play Horde all day tomorrow until I hit atleast the twentieth wave to gain confidence . XD 
If the whole world told me I should dissapear , could I fall right next to you ? Just let me burn the night away , it's the simple things you say to me that get me through the day . You keep me wide awake , my favorite mistake . What I'd give to see your face tonight ~ <3 
I never had a reason to be scared for no reason until you came along . But I guess the heart has reasons that Reason knows nothing of ... never quite liked reason anyway ~ <3 
Pepper relish Lays and hardcore Gears 2 ? I think so . :3 <3 
So , looks like I've got an interview at BUCDIA tommorow morning , and going to Gamestop and Animadness after . :D Gears 1 , and possibly Assassins Creed and maaaaaayyyyybee WET , here I come ? <3 
Just woke up to a bright orange sky out my window . <3 Naps make everything better ~ 
Is it strange that I miss you more at night time ? I guess that's just the ghost of years past and everything it didn't amount to haunting me again . You keep me wide awake ~ 
It's a bit of a shame that two hearts can be connected but not together ~ <3 
Upside of Gears : It's Gears . <3 \ 
Downside of Gears : I'm starting to wonder if these massive 24-hour headaches are worth it . -.-; 
Heading out to BUCDIA soon , and mum's making me take a sketchbook . Had I known Shaine would be looking through it , I probably would've drawn more . >.> 
I can't wait to get my flatscreen . Maybe with better quality , I won't have to squint to see subtitles and tutorial commands . XD 
Is deciding whether to stay in bed thirsty , or to stop being lazy and put some pants on . :O 
Just found a life-sized Lancer replica .... I'm tempted . O.O 
I hate it when you AND your C o-o p partner both run out of ammo in the middle of a fight . D: Maybe lunch'll make me feel better about myself ~ :P <3 
I think I'm a little more into Yugioh ! than a healthy 16-year-old should be . O.o 
SCREW JERSEY SHORE . I don't need my homepage raped with this crap every Thusday ! D:< 
Well , the good thing about staying home sick is that I have the time to blast all the music I didn't have time to listen to before ~ <3 
Bored until 9:30 rolls around , so I propose a deal : \like\ " this status and I will write 5 words describing you on your wall . :) GO . " 
WOOOO , despite our team failing epically at times , FINALLY got to play Gears with < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > at the same time . :D I've gotten better than a couple weeks ago , and my rep finally went up , lol . Awesome night ~ <3 
So maybe I haven't got my physical wings yet , but mentally , I'm about as free as a spirit can get ~ <3 
So yesterday was my last night of work til next year , meaning freeedooommm until the 31st . More Gears , a flatscreen , and hopefully finally having the time to < PROPFEMALE > out more , here I come ! >:D <3 
If I could have everyone's attention please ? * ahem * .... THE GAME , YOU ALL JUST LOST IT . :D <3 
\I think it broke from too much gay . \ " - my mom . XD <3 " 
So it seems to be that I am , by defenition , a hippie . Too bad I don't let anything define me ~ <3 
Feels so much better about Oreo now . I'm glad to know she's okay ~ <3 
And even with all the others chasing her , she decides to run in the other direction , cuz she's far too busy chasing you ~ 
I love how I use Poochie as a scapegoat for hugging Oreo whenever I start missing her . XD <3 
< PROPFEMALE > Comb cereal and hardcore Gears ? I think so . >:D <3 Although I find it strange that hardcore is easier to get through than casual is . O.o 
Is done wasting energy on being sad on this cold and depressing day . WHO ELSE FEELS LIKE GETTING UP AND DANCING ? >:D <3 
And we went from friends to enemies in the blink of an eye . But there are some things you can't just back down from . And I'm fine . :) <3 
I'm not trying to be perfect . I'm just trying to be the kind of person no one else has dared to become ~ <3 
And I wish there was a way to put what I'm feeling into a poetic status ... but there's not . 
Well , I've said my part . I can only hope things go well from here . But until they do , blasting a few people's heads off doesn't sound like a bad idea . :D <3 
Learned this morning that we start on shop week . TODAY JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER ~ ! >:D <3 
There are sometimes where I just wish Formspring questions had a \like\ " button\ " . XD " 
Gears , new headphones , and Vampires Suck tomorrow ? I think so . >:D But until then , eggs and hash for dinner . <3 
And if when we're older you only remember one thing about me , I hope it's this : I loved you once . <3 
I've decided to try this out of curiosity . Like or comment on this status , if I somehow , even if by just a little , made some sort of impact on your life . It'd be nice to know who exactly I'm sharing this smile with ~ :D <3 <3 
So I made my own temp tattoo . :D < PROPFIRST > it , inked it , shopped it , printed in on special paper , and had it all set to go , the perfect size and everything ... then I went to put it on and the paper stuck to itself , utterly destroying it ... so much for showing mum how I'd be able to hide it and how good it'd look . ; A ; </3 
Fact : If you wear pants prone to static in a dark room and cause friction , ELECTRICITY SHOOTS FROM YOUR FINGERS . >:D <3 
Heading out to see Vampires Suck with < PROPFEMALE > Tucker , < PROPFEMALE > Pag , and Kriss < PROPMALE > soon ! :D This oughta be epic . XD <3 
I love how the actor playing Vampires Suck's version of < PROPFIRST > is better looking than < PROPMALE > . Same goes for < PROPFEMALE > . And it makes me love it just that much more . XD <3 
Now has all the ingredients she needs to make some mean stir fried < PROPFEMALE > Soy Ramen . >:D <3 
You'd think that by now I'd figure out that the answer to artist's block isn't to wait it out . D: QUICK , SOMEONE GIVE ME A WORD TO DRAW INSPIRATION FROM . 
Having a Monsters Inc movie night wiff mum and dad . :D <3 
I'm not jealous , I just don't appreciate the fact that you felt the sudden need to hide my existance after she came around . :) 
Gonna go draw , cuz it's kinda sad that the sketchbook McCready gave me back in May is still .. well ... empty . >.> 
Dear the new Facebook Mobile , \ 
I hate you . Go back to the old one ? Kthanks . :D \ 
- < PROPFIRST > 
Well , that was an ... interesting round of Gears . XD I was actually doing good until about 9 . o.o ; 
It's just starting to < PROPFEMALE > on me that I get to see all my awesome friends again in less than a week . :D I'VE MISSED YOU GUYS SO VERY MUCH ~ <3 
So the college of my dreams not only has connections to Harmonix , but is RIGHT next door to an anime shop . Coincidence ? I think not . >:D 
I love it when I get high achievements without even trying . >:D 
Mmm , woke up just in time for perogies ~ <3 Drawing , and maybe some WET after ? 
Woooo , my gamerscore is finally four digits ! XD <3 
Today is the tomorrow you were dreaming of yesterday ~ \ 
Gonna attempt to fall asleep . G'night . <3 
Well , everyone else is figuring out their schedules and posting them , SO WHY NOT JOIN IN . Posted it in my notes , if you have any with me , please say so . :D <3 
Man , no matter how many times I see the Gears < PROPFIRST > scene , I still get teary . D: 
I just played Xbox from 9 in the morning to 5:45 ... I think I'm done with games today . XD 
I find it pretty ironic that the only one I want , is the only one I can't have . 
Senior year --> BUCDIA --> Harmonix . Yeah , sounds like a plan to me . <3 
Getting ready for the Freshmen Orientation prep day . Leaving around 8:45 , with Gears and WET until then ~ <3 
Just went BEAST in Annex . >:D ... against all bots , but still beast . XD 
\You grubby-a ** b ****** are going down ! Like way down - dead down - so down you ain't even gonna know which way is UP ! \ " I love < PROPMALE > . XD <3 " 
I think I pinched a nerve in my neck from headbanging too furiously . O.O 
I've come to the conclusion that the next time a child screams bloody murder , I'm gonna point my NERF gun at them from the window and scream \BURN THE WITCH . \"" 
I wish I could go back to the days where all I had to do was lay a blanket in the dark and try to distinguish the fireflies from the stars . The days where I didn't have a care in the world , and you were everything I needed ~ <3 
Today oughta be an easy day of stage skits , dancing , barbeque , and not-having-to-do-as-much-cuz-I'm-a-SENIOR . >:D <3 
Shop + Mr McCready + All the friends I've missed so dearly = Awesome day tomorrow . <3 
Sleeping under the city lights , stars , and cool breeze tonight . Probably the last night for a while that I'll be able to spend the night outside ~ <3 
I think I might die from all the excitement ! >:D SENIOR YEAR , BABY , THE YEAR OF NOT GIVING A CRAP . 
Has come to the conclusion that you've changed , I changed , and that maybe I need to accept that maybe that's just how it's gotta be . :) <3 
Is gonna write an ACTUAL letter for everyone in shop . Just cuz I can , and I like seeing all your lovely faces smiling ~ :) <3 
Just wrote an essay including the line \It's not everyday you can save the world from a zombie apocalypse . \ " This is what happens when you let me rant about what I want to do for a living . O.O " 
Heading out to < PROPFEMALE>'s soon . Bringing the Xbox so I can attempt to teach her some Gears .... this will be interesting . XD 
Has a throbbing forehead due to < PROPFEMALE > Tucker dropping a camera on it and causing me to bleed profusely . :D <3 
Today is the tomorrow you were dreaming of yesterday ~ <3 
How can the only thing that's killing me make me feel so alive ? 
Hopefully finishing up and sending out my BUCDIA application soon . This is the college of my dreams , wish me luck ~ ! :D <3 
Gears + Birthday cake = AWESOME DAY AHEAD . >:D <3 
Went around scraping my knees during rock climbing , catching frogs , eating cake , and unlocking Gears achievements for my cousin . An all around good day ~ <3 
In wondering whether or not you're actually my best < PROPMALE > or not , I came to one conclusion : Best < PROPMALE > s don't have to wonder if they're best < PROPMALE > s or not . 
AND SUDDENLY I AM THROWN INTO A GEARS PARTY . O.O 
I hate it when I'm taking a shower and the shampoo and conditioner decide to gang-bang my eyes . > . O 
Cooking dinner for my parents for a change Mmmmm , soy < PROPFEMALE > stir fried ramen , FTW ~ ! >:D <3 
Ugh , why is everyone so negative ? Nobody's ever improved their life by dwelling on the bad side of things . Try smiling ~ <3 
Bringing my own lunch to school for the first time scince .... like , Kindergarten . XD Too bad I don't have time for some Portal before I leave ~ 
Portal and apple chips , FTW ~ ! >:D <3 
And yet , even after all this , something inside me is still saying there's something I've been missing . That you're still something worth fighting for . 
Just walked around my house singing \I Believe In A Thing Called Love\ " thanks to < PROPFEMALE > Tucker who got it stuck in my head . D:< " 
Woah , I got thinking so deep just now . Did you ever stop to realize that somewhere , right now , someone walking this Earth is the person you're going to be spending the rest of your life with ? I couldn't help but smile ~ <3 
Poochie just came up to me while I was brushing my teeth and started begging for the toothpaste . O.o Silly cat ~ <3 
Is going to sleep smiling tonight . G'night errone , sweet dreams ~ <3 :) 
Man , I just almost threw up . Faux gauges smell just as bad as the real ones ! D'X 
Photoshopping Lam and Aishin finally . I'm glad to know people liked them and found them memorable . :) Though , I do feel bad for giving away the ending .... oops . >.> 
Just destroyed my entire room looking for my tablet pen ... it's gone . D: So much for using it on Lam and Aishin , haha . Hopefully I can order a compatible one on Amazon or something ? 
Has come to the conclusion that today , was a good day ~ <3 
And I wonder , when I sing along with you , if everything could ever feel this real forever ; if anything could ever be this good again . The only thing I'll ever ask of you : you've gotta promise not to stop when I say \when\ " . She sang ~ <3 " 
The truth is , that wanting to attack all Muslims for what Afghanistan and Iraq did is wrong . Sure , they did wrong , too , but wanting to destroy them and becoming hateful towards their culture doesn't make you any better than the 9/11 attackers . Everybody preaches peace , yet nobody stops to think that peace and revenge do not go hand-in-hand . R.I.P the soldiers and U.S citizens that lost their lives 9 years ago ~ <3 
So there's either Harmonix in Cambridge or Rockstar in Andover .... I'm liking these future opportunities ~ >:D <3 
Having a glow stick LightSaber duel with myself , FTW ~ ! >:D 
You know an animal loves you when they crawl onto your back and fall asleep , using your head as a pillow ~ Haha , g'night , everyone , sweet dreams ~ <3 
Woke up early enough to watch the sunrise this morning . I can tell today is gonna be another good day ~ <3 
Is slowly but surely getting addicted to < PROPFIRST > Lambert . Especially \Whataya Want From Me \"~ :3 <3 " 
FINALLY downloading the Gears map packs and deleted scene . Too bad the process takes hours . D: 
Somehow managed to stay busy ALL day . Hikes , movie , Barnes n ' Nobles , Gamestop , Gears , and now shower . I KNEW today would be a good day ~ <3 
Should be an eeeeaaaaaasy day of academics today . I'm actually kinda looking forward to it . :D 
Screw studying for Spanish right now , I've got better things to do . Like finish downloading Gears map packs and photoshopping Lam . STUFF I ACTUALLY NEED IN MY LIFE . 
Still doesn't really understand Spanish , and believe it or not , still doesn't really care . :) 
So , I actually plan on looking nice tomorrow . How many people actually care ? :P <3 
If I lay here , if I just lay here , would you lie with me and just forget the world ? All that I am , all that I ever was , is here in your perfect eyes . They're all I can see ~ <3 
Actually feels pretty for once , haha ~ <3 :P 
Gears plans all tonight and mum possibly bringing home the < PROPMALE > of Persia DVD for me ? I think so . >:D 
So the Gamestop in < PROPFEMALE > is hiring ... I'm tempted . >:D Though I've heard a lot of stories , and I doubt I'd get in anyways . XD 
If I hear a skinny girl call herself fat one more time , I'm gonna slap her across the face . >:O 
Is for some reason completely and utterly dissapointed ... by quite a few things . I guess tonight's just not my night . :/ Hopefully sleep will help . <3 
Mum never brought home < PROPMALE > of Persia ... I'm kinda dying a little on the inside right now . D: Though Gears later tonight should more than fix that . >:D 
If all goes according to plan , Gears tonight oughta be veeeeeeery interesting . Especially seeing as < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > aren't exactly the best of friends . XD 
I know that I'm not perfect , I'll admit that I'm a fool . I'm always getting lost , but finding my way back to you : the one I need when I'm awake . Take me Home ~ ? <3 
Is just realizing that my senior pics are tomorrow ... meaning I should prooooobably get working on some laundry so I don't show up in sweats and a T shirt . O.O ; 
I've come to the conclusion that I'm only good at Gears when it's not up against other Live players ... -.-; 
Re-straightening my hair cuz the rain raped it . D: 
Gonna see if I can get a new Sr. pics shoot , all mine came out HORRIBLE . D: And I'll pay for it myself so that mum can't yell at me for wearing a hat . XD <3 
Anybody know a site that allows you to set up a blog ? I suddenly really wanna make my own site for < PROPMALE > and opinions and stuff . :O 
Can't sleep due to the lack or air coming in through my left nostril . D: Being sick suuuuuuucccckks ! 
I hate dreams that feel real , cuz then you're dissapointed when you wake up and realize it never happened . :/ It felt sooooooo good to be able to be able to fly for those few hours , though ~ <3 
ALL YOUR < PROPMALE > OF PERSIA ARE BELONG TO ME . >:D <3 
I like it on the store shelves , where everyone can see it . ;D 
Just sneezed so much I got a nosebleed .... school may or may not be an option tomorrow . o.o 
If there's one good thing about being sick , it's this : I had enough time to read over , no lie , 1000 6BillionSecrets and GivesMeHope stories , and realized that any birthday money I recieve is going straight to < PROPFEMALE > , and the only thing I'm gonna ask for are childrens toys so I can donate them , too ~ <3 
The < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > episode of Yes , Dear is by far the most amusing thing I've seen all day . XD 
Yeah , definetally feeling a LOT better than before , haha . Expect to see me in shop again tomorroy ~ :D <3 
I hate it when you want to make sure someone is okay , but you don't want to be a bother to them . : X Praying for all the people I love right now , cuz it seems everybody's got something worth praying for . <3 
Deleted my last status because I feel better now . XD AND I'VE COME TO THIS CONCLUSION : We need a shop party , maybe such a thing will hieghten everybody's spirits a bit , neh ? All in favor , SUGGEST IT TO CREADSTER WITH ME . >:D <3 
Really wishes the park by my house had a swingset . All my worries and fears seem to just melt away when my feet aren't touching the ground ~ <3 
Needs something to draw , cuz I haven't been able to pull something out in the past 6 MONTHS . D: </3 I fear of losing my touch ... 
Just spray painted the crap outta one of my canvases , using a gas mask and all . It's all silver , turquoise , black , red , and purple now , gonna add some designs over it in Sharpie later . >:3 <3 I REALLY needed that ~ 
I CAN DRAW AGAIN , FTW ~ !!!!!! >:D <3 And it only took 6 months . >.> 
I hate how after coming out with an awesome under-drawing/anatomy sketch , I have no < PROPFEMALE > to cover it with clothes . O.o .... I really need to make a nudist character , just to solve this predicament . 
I love how the kids on Bus 3 stopped poking me with a tape measurer after they realized that I'd whip it out the window if they did it again . :D And they only dared to call me names AFTER I got off the bus . Mhhmmmm , you're definetally too \gangster\ " for me to handle . XD " 
Gonna go beast on my Guitar Hero drums , because I feel like hitting something for no apparent reason . :O 
The stupidity of some people never ceases to amaze me . :D I fear for the fate of our world when they reproduce . <3 
Putting sugar on strawberries to satisfy my sweet tooth . Healthy ? Probably now . Delicious ? Hellz yeah . >:D 
Plans for today : Paint , start an essay , and do laundry so I don't end up wearing my Stop n ' Shop uniform to school Monday . o.o 
This could very well be one of my best pieces TO DATE . <3 I've never been so pleased with how a painting's come along before ~ >:D 
My friends never cease to make me feel like the most beautiful girl in the whole wide world . I love you guys , and I serisously don't know what I'd do without you ~ <3 
One last thought before I go to bed : I'm seriously gonna cosplay Rhyme ( The World Ends With You ) sometime in the near future . <3 But I need someone to be my Beat . D: 
FINALLY got my Physics essay done ! >:D Though I'm kinda wondering what grade I'm gonna get what with the opening line being , \It reminded me of Batman ! \ " O.o ; " 
I don't care how many candles I need to blow out , hugs I need to give , or stars I need to wish on ; The only thing I want is for you to be happy . <3 
I hate walking to the bus stop in the dark . : X We should just not have school today . All in favor ~ ? :D 
Insert witty status here , cuz I keep deleting the others due to lack of creativity . \ 
I really am running low on < PROPMALE > istic feelings right now ... and I seriously need to change that before I lose all the < PROPMALE > in my he < PROPMALE > and wind up with just a \he \"." 
Alright , I confess : I really don't need a wish right now , I don't like the way you lie , and it's pretty rare for me to throw my hands up and scream \AYOOOO ~\" . \ 
So I've come to the conlusion that today , was an amazing day ~ <3 >:D 
Only one more shoe to go for Rhyme , and it should go a lot faster now that I know what I'm doing . :P After that it's on to Beat's~ >:D <3 
So I got a little sad for about 5 minutes there , then I called Domino's .... and got violin hold music ... so I laughed , and now I feel better . :D <3 
I love you . <3 
Sleeping with my NERF gun at hand because I keep hearing strange voices and I find the idea of shooting the noise with oddly colored styrofoam bullets comforting . :D 
Woke up to the sound of a doorbell . O.o Whether it was in my dream or someone actually had the balls to come to my house at 5 AM , I'll never know . XD 
Saw somebody walking around < PROPFEMALE > with a \Save Carmine\ " shirt . I like where I live just that much more now . XD " 
Dear Facebook Mobile , \ 
Why do you insist on holding back things from me ? You won't let me be with my friends , you hide crap , you constantly fail to tell me important things ... you've changed . And until you clean yourself up , we are DONE . >:O \ 
Love , < PROPFIRST > 
If I hear one more naked child honk a < PROPFEMALE > Jeep horn at me , I'm telling them < PROPFEMALE > doesn't exist . D:< 
So yesterday was a doorbell , and today I woke up with a burnt tongue ... it wasn't burnt when I went to bed . Should I be worried ? O.o 
Plans for today : Salvation Army , get home , play TWEWY , hopefully beat TWEWY , \nerdgasm\ " 
I WOULD find a way to get my belly button caught in a zipper . > . O 
OMNOMNOMNOM ANIMAL CRACKERS . >:D Ahhhh , the beginning to a great day ~ 
So the pen cap I thought I lost during Spanish ? I found it ... and it was down my pants . O.o HOW IT GOT THERE , I DO NOT KNOW . 
Finally getting my creative skills back in action , and I MEAN it this time ! >:D <3 Mmm , finally got the basic character designs down for all important people in FLIGHT , I < PROPFIRST > something productive today , AAANNNNNDDD working on PSing < PROPFEMALE > . Good day ? I think so . 
While eating and playing TWEWY , I kinda forgot whick hand the fork was in and almost ate the stylus instead . O.o ; 
My baby cousin just picked up a toy giraffe and screamed \DUCKY ! \ " :D <3 " 
Totally watching SpongeBob and Invader Zim with everyone . >:D <3 
Everything you've ever learned about giraffes , cats , and Spongebob ? It's all a lie . They're all DUCKIES , fact by my 2-year-old cousin Alivia . >:O 
The one thing I hate about having younger family members over : No drawing , painting , cosplaying , or Xbox . Well , there goes the next few days of my life . D: 
Just sand Old McDonald using Gears characters : And on his farm he had a Butcher , EE-AI-EE-AI-OH , with a \FOOOOOD . \ " here ..... >:D ... there's something wrong with me . O.O ; " 
Totally not taping < PROPFEMALE > ears onto < PROPMALE>'s shoes right now . :D 
Going on an epic quest through Boston with the family . >:D <3 
In Fanuil Hall now , and just screamed \THE GAME . \ " Atleast ten people flipped out at me . \ 
Achievement Unlocked - 25G : The Squirrel Whisperer . \ 
Had a squirrel climb up my arm today ! >:D <3 
Is loving the fact that people think my mum's cool . XD <3 
So today was horrible . Not in a good mood by any means .... anyone know where I can buy a punching bag ? 
\You're the one who taught me to try and be happy with what you've got and to stay positive no matter what . \ " - < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Trifaro \ 
Y'know what , N3 ? SCREW YOU AND YOUR HORRIBLE GAMEPLAY . You're totally getting traded in for L4D when I get the < PROPMALE > . >:D 
So yeah , I should probably find something to eat before my stomache scares the cat into falling off the sofa again . O.o 
Sometimes I wish I was never given a name . Maybe then when people call for me , they'd call me by who they know I am , and not by what labels have been given to me . 
Why does it seem like 99% of the people around me have nothing better to talk about than sex ? You're really starting to disgust me . -.-; 
I love putting on a new pair of comfy socks in the morning . >:3 Hopefully today'll be a good day , cuz the past two have been crap . 
Doesn't mind being wet so much now that I know my PSP , hair straightener , sketchbook , and bag of sneakers are atleast dry . :D <3 
So , Andrew/Beat's shoes are looking pretty kick-awesome right about now . >:D Taking a break to make the ' rents dinner and watch some Zombieland snippits ~ <3 
My dad WOULD save the day and bring home the exact kind of velcro I need . >:D \ 
I love you , Daddy ~ <3 
Wants N3 out of this house , just looking at the box < PROPMALE > gets me a little ticked ! XD But unfortunately , I am unable to trade it in for Left 4 Dead for atleast another week . Sad face . D: 
Dad just accused me of being addicted to Facebook . Is it really so bad that I just want to talk to my friends ? I hate phones , I can almost never < PROPFEMALE > out , and I can't text . I'm not addicted to Facebook , just to my friends , is that so bad ~ ? <3 
Just fell off my bed and hit my head on the wall ... twice . :D \ 
( Take note , I almost wrote \fell off my head and hit my bed . \ " ... I think the brain damage is starting to kick in . O.o ) " 
Totally not blasting Oceans Deep ' s EP in my living room right now . :P You guys are awesome , I love it so much ~ ! >:D ? ? 
Is it bad that I'm kinda proud for getting my first broken bone ? O.o It may be a toe , but it hurts like hell to walk , haha . 
Ripping CDs , writing out some of FLIGHT's plotline , and eating string cheese . Sounds like an awesome night to me . >:D <3 
I must have , like ..... supernatural healing abilities or something , cuz I just woke up to a fully healed toe . I KNOW it was broken yesterday . O.O 
Totally not taking a picture of me in a pink dress for the yearbook , of course not . :O ... ~ <3 
Writing out a little more of FLIGHT . I love days where ideas just come to you . >:D <3 
Is trollin ' the trolls and enjoying it greatly . >:D 
Alright , I've got FLIGHT's extremely rough plotline down , and I'm realizing that I need to work on a few new character designs . Therefore meaning : my creativity should be 100% once again very soon . >:D Hurrah ! 
Happy birthday , Daddy ! I love you ~ :D <3 
I've just come to quite the scary concusion ... I actually look good in frilly pink dresses . O.O 
Working on character concepts , character templates , enviroment concepts , and plotlines for FLIGHT ... and they're all comeing out extremely well . <3 What was originally a crappy shoujo anime 2 years ago is now an action horror video game .... and I LOVE IT . >:D 
Man , if I don't stop finding new bands to get into , my PSP won't have room for game save data anymore . O.o 
So my BUCDIA application is officially sent out . I should know within a week whether I'm accepted or not . Crossing my fingers , wish me luuuuccckkkk ~ ! :D <3 
Has come to the conclusion that I can pwn pretty epically at Gears ! >:D .... but only against bots in Custom . ; A ; 
Poochie just got so scared he jumped a foot in the air and farted ! I can't stop laughing ~ XD <3 
Saw the guy with the Save < PROPMALE > shirt while walking home again ! And this time I got to high-five him ! >:D <3 My day is kinda officially complete now , haha . 
I love days where the only thing you feel is goosebumps , laughter , and smiles . Today was a pretty amazing day in my book ~ <3 
Wearing my Stop n ' Shop uniform to school due to my dryer's lack of drying ability . This oughta be interesting . XD 
Listening to Breathe < PROPFEMALE > , eating < PROPMALE > , and wearing some damn comfy Sock Monkey slippers . Today is complete ~ <3 
Man , today was so booooorrriiiinnnnngggg . Didn't understand math for the life of me , everything else went by slow , and Spanish we had a sub .. but I had no one to talk to . XD So glad tomorrow's Friday ~ <3 
Almost died cuz dad accidentally scared the hell out of me , causing me to brace myself from a heart attack so I wouldn't fall backwards down a flight of stairs ... this is why I hate my basement at night . o.o 
Making ramen , then playing horde with < PROPFIRST > for the rest of the day . >:D <3 
Gonna spend the rest of my weekend whoring Gears achievements until I get L4D . Then only 6 more days ~ ! :D <3 
Gotta love curling up into bed in only shorts and a hoodie ~ <3 Falling asleep to the sound of mum getting frustrated with a DS game in the other room . XD 
Has come to the conclusion that L4D's gonna have to wait a while if I wanna get enough money together for cosplay and AB11 .... it's worth it . >:D <3 
Cure for boredom and lack of money ? Beg for chores . o.o 
Woooo , Rhyme's hat is complete ! :D That was probably the easiest thing I'm gonna have to do for this , haha . 
Has come to the conclusion that my birthday cake is going to equal the cake from Portal ! >:D Can't wait to start making it ~ <3 
Watching Scare Tactics just cuz ... if somebody did that to me they'd get quite the punch in the face . :D 
Oh sure , I can't get comfy now , but watch , the second that 5:30 AM alarm goes off , bed's gonna be the comfiest place in existance . D: Gonna atleast try , g'night~ <3 
\Truth is ... \ " that I'm really bored and have nothing better to do . You know the rest . >:D " 
I REJECT YOUR REALITY AND SUBSTITUTE MY OWN . <3 
Feeling a bit better . Why ? Because ramen solves everything . >:D <3 
Dear room , \ 
I just cleaned you yesterday , stop throwing up everywhere ! D:< Kthanks . \ 
< PROPFIRST > 
Naaaaaht going to school today , staying home in hopes of getting better . Should be back in tomorrow so plans are still up ! >:O 
Simply because I'm bored and this will give me something to do besides clean and drink pomegranate juice for the rest of the day , like this status and I will tell you : Something that I've learned from looking at your wall , the color you remind me of , my first memory of you , the animal you remind me of , ask something that I've always wondered about you , my favorite thing about you , and give you a weird name . :D <3 
Can breathe through both nostrils again ! SUCCESS ! XD Just gotta make a cake , clean , and type something up , then tomorrow's gonna be AWESOME . >:D <3 
Totally just got gang-raped with wall posts and returned the favor . >;D <3 Back in school tomorrow , and the weekend's gonna be eeeepppppiiiic ~ ! 
Dear Vicks Vaporub and Icy Hot patches , \ 
You complete me . <3 \ 
~ Andrea >:D 
So begins the most epic weekend I'll have probably until AB11 . >:D Today's gonna be aaaawesooooome ~ ! <3 
Kinda sorta accidentally scared the crap out of some poor innocent bystander in Boston today because he looked exactly like a buddeh of mine , causing me to scream , point , and say \WIGGLE WIGGLE ~ D:< \ " ... I hate it when that happens . " 
Man , what a boring end to an amazing weekend . I have absolutely nothing to do . XD 
Drawing Morrigan because I have the sudden urge to draw Darkstalkers characters even though I've never played the game . o.o ; 
Alright , hopefully this won't get lost in a sea of wall post rapes , because I REALLY want this to be easily read from my wall . XD\ 
BUT LOOK WHO'S IN BUCDIA NOW , ALL YOU NON-BELIEVERS , LOOK WHO'S IN BUCDIA NOW ! >:D <3 It can only go up to Harmonix from here ~ 
I love that numb , sweaty feeling you get after going beast on a Guitar Hero drumset .... yes , I said Guitar Hero . XD 
Defenition of a great night : Tying a blanket cape around your neck and jumping on the bed whilst reaching for the glo-in-the-dark stars on your ceiling ~ \ 
... Then falling off and realizing that you're happier than you have been in a while . <3 
Just heard the news mention something abuot a corporal fighting a bull on a set of train tracks ... I never meant for that to get on the news . >.> 
Just realized that even with free L4D , I still need to trade in N3 for something ... I'm thinking < PROPMALE>'s Inferno . O.o Anybody ever played it ? 
Was so excited to go to Gamestop today !.... and then mum told me that something happened to our tire and now I can't go . ; A ; DISLIKE . 
Got wolf-whistled at while walking home from the bus stop ... and I actually felt proud because for once , it was someone my age and NOT a middle-aged creeper . XD 
Startled and killed my first Witch ... hurrah ! >:D 
To all you angry people out there , I invite you to faceplant your keyboard and post the resulting jibberish as a comment on this status . \ 
You get your anger out , we all get a good laugh . It's a Win-Win situation . >:D <3 
So I'm playing L4D when I hear a crash in the bathroom , and mum muttering under her breath over the spill ... \PEELZ HERE . \"" 
Gotta love the people at Gamestop , freaking awesome people to talk to . >:D Darkstalkers for PSP , MagnaCarta 2 , and < PROPMALE>'s Inferno , FTW ! ? 
Not in the best of moods , and I don't even know why . >.< Hopefully the day'll get better ~ <3 
Apparently G4 is no longer available on Directv . I'm just about ready to destroy something . D:< 
Feeling a ton better . :3 <3 I've gotta stop letting my mind speak over my heart , haha ~ \ 
Though pwning demons in < PROPMALE>'s Inferno helped , too . >:D 
Making it a mission for today to be a better day than yesterday . >:D Senior year , I'm not gonna waste a second of it ~ <3 
OMNOMNOMNOM < PROPFEMALE > CORN . >:D Awesome day so far , the week's definetally shaped up since Monday , haha ~ <3 
Saw a guy at the bank who asked for 200 dollars , all in singles . I can only imagine where he's going tonight . XD 
The night will go as follows : Ramen , a little < PROPMALE>'s Inferno , and then Yu-Gi-Oh ! Abridged until I can't feel my sides due to laughter . >:D So much fun in shop today , quoting episodes the entire time ~ XD <3 
Dad : \You hungry ? \ " \ 
Has been quoting YGO Abridged in casual conversation with my parents for the past 5 hours or so ... and the best part is that I still sound normal to them . >:D <3 
Man , today's going by so slooooooowwww ! Been sleeping all day because of it ... I feel like a cat ~ :D 
So yeah , my plan for donating money and supplies using what I got for my birthday ? All toys recieved are going towards daycare centers , and money is being used for either a goat or $550 worth of medicine in a third world country . Hell . Yeah . >:D <3 
So it's almost eleven and I can't fall asleep because the house is shaking due to how freaking loud the neighbor's music is . \ 
Definetally gonna blast something hardcore next time they need to get some rest . :D 
Had an extremely realistic dream , woke up , wondered if it was real or not , looked at the clock , realized it's Daylight Savings , and couldn't remember whether it was really 9 or 10 . o.o TRAVELING DIMENSIONS MUCH ? 
Why do some people have nothing better to do than turn everything into a negative arguement ? -.-; GH drums to get out the urge to smash something , then getting ready to < PROPFEMALE > with < PROPFEMALE > for the day ~ ! >:D <3 
Today was craaaaaaaappp , the only highlight was Physics class . XD Hopefully tomorrow will be a better day ... with less rain . o.o 
Soooooooo boooooored . So like this status and I'll write something onyour wall ... don't know what yet , but it'll be something . >:D <3 
Totally didn't just miss the drumset and smash the crap out of my leg with a drumstick and cause it to snap in half and fly across the room , course not . < PROPFEMALE > much paaaaaaaaiiiin . DX 
Playing some Sonic CD ... I feel like a 5-year-old again . XD Then more Yu-Gi-Oh ! Abridged until my flu shots .... yes , that was a plural . D:< 
Screw you , Facebook Mobile , you always change the second I get used to the last update ! >.< .... EGYPTIAN RAGE . 
Dear 4Kids , \ 
You can utterly destroy any and all anime you can reach . You can give voice actors bad names by forcing them to work on your crap . You can even deny < PROPFEMALE > the rights to see a dubbed version of YuGiOh Season Zero . BUT ONCE YOU BLOCK MULTIPLE YUGIOH ABRIDGED EPISODES BECAUSE YOU FELT INSULTED , YOU'VE GONE TOO FAR . D:< 
It's not even 12 and I already want the day to be over . XD It's going by so sloooooooww ... and I feel so fat . .______. 
Cleaning everything in sight because my mum seems to believe that my friends actually care whether my house is clean or not . Hell , I'm still finding chocolate chips on the bathroom floor from last time ! XD 
Screw a wish , I could really use a sammich right now . D:< 
Is it bad that on the way home , I saw a Pokemon card lying facedown on the sidewalk , and six hours later , I'm still wishing I picked it up just to see which Pokemon it was ? o.o 
Dear bed , \ 
I'm so sorry I left you this morning . I'd much rather be in your comforting blankets gazing at the glow-in-the-dark stars until I slip into a dream about the zombie apocalypse . Take me back ? \ 
Love , Andrea ~ <3 
Freaking awesome night , haha . >:D <3 Just one problem ... there's not gonna be another one for about a month or two . Note to self : Never play truth Or Dare with a parent in the next room . o.o ; 
I love days when a smile is permanently plastered on my face ~ <3 
Q : Whick 90's show needs to come back to TV the most ? \ 
A : Wouldn't be able to tell you . See , I had no childhood besides a Sega < PROPFEMALE > and 5 channels . Most I watched was Cyberchase . XD 
Q : Would you like to play a card game ? \ 
A : * Is chilling , dangling off a rope hanging off a rooftop * Uhh ... what sort of game ? 
Q : Who's your favorite cousin ? \ 
A : Naht < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Trifaro , that's for sure . ;P <3 
So yeah , the jeans I wore today with the hole in one knee ? That hole is now no longer ... in fact , neither is the pantleg . ._____. \ " , 2010-11-15 20:45:03 " 
Noooooooot in the best of moods . At all . -.-; And the worst part is that I don't even know why . o.o 
You know you're finally at peace with your hair when you can't decide whether to straighten it or not , and it's not even raining . <3 
Achievement Unlocked - 20 G : I no longer believe myself to be ugly , and screw all the people who think I am . >:D <3 
Dear Facebook , \ 
All I requested was the little red box went away after I checked a notification . \ 
Not for you to take away all my notifications in general . \ 
Stop screwing up ? Kthanks . :D \ 
Only two words can describe how I'm feeling right now : Damn . Good . >:D <3 
Somehow just managed to get a piece of toast stuck to my ceiling . I CAN'T STOP LAUGHING . 
Playing games like Sonic 3 and Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine just doesn't feel the same without the ceremonial blowing of the cartridges beforehand . D: Kinda wishing I kept my < PROPFEMALE > , haha . <3 
Mmmm , awesome day , looking forward to the weeks ahead ~ I swear , nothing much can bring me down right now . >:D <3 
SO , it's International Make Someone Feel Uncomfortable Day today ... this is gonna be FUN . >:D 
Replaying every old Sonic game I've ever owned , painting a pretty picture , and noming on something unhealthy . >:D Today was honestly one of the best days I've had in a while ~ <3 
Dear tube of white gouache , \ 
I hate you . SO much . No words can express how much I utterly despise you right now . Except for maybe \I utterly despise you . \ " I hope you drown in a river of hatred spawned by my hate of you and your white gouacheness . \ 
Just cleaned my room and found the cat . o.o ; 
Curling up in mah blankets with a warm cup of I-Had-An-Awesome-Day . >:D <3 
I think this is the latest I've stayed up since working over the summer . O.o Good thing I have nothing to do tomorrow . Err ... today . XD <3 
Mmm , went to bed with a smile and woke up with a smile . I can already tell today is gonna be an awesome day ~ >:D <3 
Who had a super special awesome day ? I DID ~ ! >:D <3 
Kinda forgot about my neck pain , and decided headbanging was a good idea ... we meet again , neck pain . DERP . :D 
Mmgh , not in the best of moods again . : X But looking forward to the half-day tomorrow , and the possibility of going back into work early ~ ! >:D <3 
Dear Poochie , \ 
I love you and everything , but I'd appreciate it if you didn't crush my chest and ribs in the process of laying on me . I'm not that fond of having paws squish every bone imaginable ... even if they're cute paws . <3 \ 
Kthanks , < PROPFIRST > 
Got a freaking awesome day ahead ! Chill in school til 11 , get home for some last minute Xbox , then leaving for < PROPFEMALE > at midnight/dawn . >:D <3 
Went on Shark Robot to go n ' order mah BROOKLYN RAGE T-shirt ... then I made the mistake of searching through all of the shirts ... and now I can't decide . ; A ; TOO MUCH AWESOME . D:< 
Is determined to get passed this level in < PROPMALE>'s Inferno before midnight . >:D And if I don't , I just might cry ... just a little . GAH , I NEED TO BEAT THIS GAME . 
Totally not playing a chilren's card game with < PROPFEMALE > right now . >:D 
Was watching Beauty and the Beast when the \Didn't See It There Before\ " song came on ... \ 
Thanksgiving this year consisted of snow , holding chickens , learning new songs on both guitar and keyboard , and watching District 9 . AWESOME . DAY . >:D <3 
< PROPFIRST > Trifaro : * To MelB and me * I love you men . \ 
Me : And I love you , too , woman . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > Tucker : You and your \beast\ " . What is this 
I love how my entire family is getting into this one game of Mirrors Edge , it's pretty intense . XD We still need to play on the theater screen , though . D:< 
Lesson of the Day : Trying to act out the word \rack\ " to family during a game of Cranium brings interesting results . XD " 
Mmm , I've got nothing better to do , so : \like\ " this and I'll tell you why I'm thankful to have met you . :D <3 \ 
< PROPMALE > of Persia with the fam . :D Funny how the third time around you notice how overplayed some parts are , haha . <3 
FINALLY home ! >:D <3 That only took nine hours of a car ride , traffic , naps , music , and Hangman . :P 
Who just got Xbox and TV FINALLY in their room , and a flatscreen in the other room for Assassins Creed ? \ 
Answer : ME . >:D <3 
Wearing one of the best T-shirts ever in the existance of T-shirts . >:D Today looks to be another awesome day ~ <3 
You know those moments where you just smile to yourself and think , \I freaking love life\ " ? \ 
If confusion is the first step to knowledge , I had better emerge from this a genius . <3 
I refuse to let myself be brought down by such a crappy day ! D:< Time for some BIOSHOCK . <3 
I can't help but feel as if I am substantially annoying . ._____. 
I get by with a little help from my friends ~ <3 
I'm somehow only JUST realizing how Polish I really look , haha . :D <3 
What's this ? I actually have the time to eat and play some morning Xbox for once ? WIN . >:D 
Heading out soon , can't wait to see how empty school's gonna be now that everyone's scared of dying . :D 
Woah , I completely forgot it was Friday . o.o Can't really tell if it was a good day or not , haha . 
Mum n ' dad finally understand what \nom\ " means ! I'm so proud of them . TwT <3 " 
So I'm playing a nice game of Mirror's Edge when out of nowhere something grunts in my ear and breathes on my neck , causing me to jump up and smack my elbow and stub my toe . D: \ 
Poochie : 1\ 
Goootta love stretching and falling off the bed first thing in the morning . :D 
So Poochie's laying on my bed and just finished cleaning himself . So I went over and ruffled his fur . >:3 \ 
I never knew cats could glare . \ 
Andrea : 1 
I can't wait until the day my hair touches my hips again ~ <3 
Had a dream that my dad killed some guy who was trying to marry me , we escaped in a canoe sled , pretended we were from AC because of it , and I won a futuristic motorcycle tournament . O.o \ 
BEST . DREAM . EVER . 
98% of women between the ages of 5 and 20 would faint if < PROPFIRST > Beiber walked in the room . \ 
I'm part of the 2% that would tell the her to make me a sammich . :D 
Dear Bed , \ 
Alarm Clock always tries to tear us apart , I know it's tough . D: But can you hold me til < PROPFEMALE > for atleast tonight ? \ 
Cuz my motorcycle-riding zombie apocalypse dream is waiting . >:D <3 \ 
Kthanks , Andrea ~ 
Upside to writing Bed a love note : Best night of sleep in a while , 10x comfier than usual . \ 
Downside : It's a Monday morning , and Bed is 10x comfier than usual ...... uuuuuuuggggghhh . 
Dear Ms. West , \ 
I know it's hard to believe , but I have a life outside of your classroom , and the amount of homework you're assigning is getting a little rediculous . \ 
Just letting you know incase I walk into your class tomorrow with absolutely no idea what I'm doing . :D 
Kowloon's leftovers , got a little further in Assassin's Creed , and actually did some homework for once ? Today , my friend , WAS A WIN . >:D <3 
I love it when you're eating spaghetti and a noodle flies up and smacks you in the eye . :D 
So I have this tasty jar of Nutella , but I don't know what to eat it with . Anybody gots suggestions ? :3 
Cleaned my room , finished some homework , kicked ass in Assassin's Creed , and ate my first ever Nutella Toast . Today , was a good day . >:D <3 \ 
Well ... minus the whole fainting and missing the bus thing . .____. 
I'm bored anyways , and I'm betting your newsfeed is already spammed with it , so why not ? INBOX ME A SECRET CODE AND I'LL DO SOMETHING COMPLETELY NOT-UNIQUE . D:< 
8675309 : MIDDLE SCHOOL BUDDEH , FTW . >:D <3 I miss yooooouuu , and will certainly find a day for us to chill soon . \ 
Also , I love how the nickname I gave you 5 years ago is being used by everyone today . XD 
52739857293857928739587298305901928409237472369502300000 : YOUR NUMBER IS UNECESSARILY LONG , AND MOBILE CAN'T C&P . XD\ 
Anywho , you give awesome hugs ... cuz you're tall . :D 
9001 : SKITTLEEEEZZZ , mah Spanish < PROPMALE > minus one day ! :D I'm glad we're such good friends , and if this S&S thing gets any worse , I shall personally complain to < PROPMALE > for you . XD 
Well , now that my profile < PROPFEMALE > and your newsfeed are both thuroughly raped , I'd like to take this < PROPMALE > to say , \Nutella : Nectar of the gods . \"" 
420 : I love how you say you hate whomever made this number thing , yet contribute a number anyways . :P Anywho , I MISSES YOU , come back and visit , nya ~ ? 
3OH ! 3 : I love how we've never met , yet still chat every now-and-then . :D You seem really awesome , haha , and I liek your hair . >:P 
221B : Anime Boston/Naruto < PROPMALE > ! >:D I think you're the one person I've met online that I actually talk to/have met and became friends with . :D Which I'm glad for , cuz you're AWESOME ~ >:D <3 
So I have come to the conclusion that the day my hair touches my hips is the day I throw on a dress and high heels , then go to the arcade and play every game available . \ 
Because that's what you do when you feel like conquering the world . >:D <3 
School , Stop n ' Shop , then home for Assassin's Creed . \ 
I look forward to the awesome day ahead . >:D <3 
Fiiiinaally home ! <3 Time for more relatives to come over , then filling out a new S&S app cuz < PROPMALE > is the man . >:D 
Feeling a litto better now . :D It's amazing what beating the crap out of virtual miis in Wii Boxing can do . Thank God for video games ! >:D 
< PROPFIRST > obtained NUTELLA FRENCH TOAST . \ 
Happiness : +9001\ 
Hunger : -20 
Smells bacon and pierogies , hears Naked Girl Avalanche , and playing Wii Tennis til my arm hurts . \ 
Crappy day slowly getting better ? I think so . >:D <3 
For once in my life , I think I'm actually at peace with myself as a person . <3 
Gamestop n ' Target , then coming home for Toy Story 3 . Today looks to be a gewd day . :3 <3 
You know you're in < PROPFEMALE > when the local carwash sign says \WASH YO CAR ! \ " .____. " 
Successfully made it through Toy Story 3 without crying ! >:D Got lumps in my throat-and still do-but didn't cry ! \ 
Also gotta admit , Buzz is still mi favorito . ;D 
Today marks the first year in my entire 17 years of existance that dad's actually decorating the outside of the house for Christmas ... I am genuinely in shock . \ 
But our porch is now covered in such pretty green lights ~ ! X3 <3 
I love how so many people are calling today a half day ... it's a 4/5 day , really . :P LURN YO FRAKSHINS . 
Mum : It's not all gonna fit into one bag . \ 
Me : I CHALLENGE YOUR CLAIM . * Fits everything into one bag * Quest completed ~ +30 EXP :3 \ 
Mum : THIS ISN'T GEARS OF WAR . \ 
Me : Gears isn't an RPG . FLAW ! \ 
Mum : * Shrug * I was close enough . 
Maybe , just maybe , I want to make a positive difference in someone's life . Maybe I just wanted to be somebody's hero . <3 
Sooo , who in DV11 wants a hand-written letter under the tree for them on Friday ? I'm in the mood for making people smile again ~ :D <3 
Eating : Cheez Doodles\ 
Writing : WINTER letters\ 
Listening to : \Tribute\ " by Tenacious D\ 
No status can describe how awesome this weekend has been so far . >:D <3 \ 
Except for maybe a status saying , \I had an awesome weekend so far\ " ... but that's besides the point . o.o " 
Mmm , awesome day , last minute plans and errthang ! :D I forget everything bad around you guys ~ <3 
Mmm , as much as I love being in my own bed again , I'm gonna miss waking up with < PROPFEMALE > cuddled up next to me , haha . :P <3 \ 
And now the mind begins to wander to all the things I shoved away before ... 
It's days like these I feel like punching someone in the face . * nod nod * Any volunteers ? :D 
So yeah , Negative Thoughts ? SCREW YOU . I've made up my mind , and I'll be damned if it's the death of me . >:D \ 
Starting my New Years Resolution early , FTW ~ <3 
I have come to realize that there are a few people in this life I just can't live without . \ 
And I'm gonna do whatever I can to keep it that way , even if I die trying . <3 
In suuuuuuch a good mood ! <3 Fresh snow , awesome friends , and video games . Today can't get any better ~ >:D 
I'm smiling so much my face is starting to hurt ... and I LOVE IT . >:D 
Staying up late on an academic school night cuz I've got better things to do than sleep ? I think so . >:D <3 
Freaking amazing night ... I literally cannot stop smiling ~ <3 >:D 
Sitting in my room looking out the window watching the snowfall ... I need to have a snowball fight with someone . >:D <3 
More fresh snow , hot shower , great music , and chilling wiff < PROPFIRST > later ? I think so . >:D Mm , looks like an awesome way to start Christmas Break ~ <3 
Pillows are better when they have heartbeats ~ :P <3 Watching < PROPMALE > Dunham's Christmas Special with mum now . 
FELIZ CHRISTMAHUNAKWAANZIKA ! >:D 
If I lay here , if I just lay here , would you lie with me and just forget the world ? <3 \ 
Goootta love Snow Patrol . >:D 
Who needs Christmas < PROPFEMALE > when my room glows like the tree year-round ? :3 <3 \ 
Hoping plans for Monday still work out ~ 
A weirdo is someone who followes their heart . But damn is it leading me in the right direction ~ >:D <3 
You may now bow down and call me \Master of the Gingerbread Cookies . \ " >:D " 
Dear Blizzard , \ 
I didn't cancel these plans for nothing . If you don't snow enough to render me unable to leave my house , I'm gonna be PISSED . D:< \ 
So I've come to the conclusion that I'm gonna start looking like a girl more often . .________. All in favor ? ;D 
So I have 46 friends online right now . Goes to show how much of a life we all have when a foot of snow hits us . XD 
Note to self : Playing Guitar Hero with cold fingers is HARD . ._____. 
Rasberry hot cocoa , with cinammon and milk , with whipped cream on top ? :O My day is officially complete . <3 
Like this status if you think I should do absolutely nothing based on the fact that you liked this status . :D 
Go ahead , ask me about my first day back at work . .____________. 
How the hell do you get addicted to eating toilet paper ? o.o 
How to get laid in 3 easy steps ! :D \ 
1 ) Lay on bed . \ 
2 ) Wait a couple hours . \ 
3 ) Lay becomes past tense . 
Cuddling Poochie , waiting around for < PROPFIRST > to get here , then < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim movie tiem ? I think so . >:D Awesome day ahead ~ <3 
Totally stealing Kriss < PROPMALE > ' s idea and eating Cheetos with chopsticks right now . >:D <3 
Is it bad that my cat's butt is the only thing keeping me warm right now ? D: 
Contemplate this status if you think it shouldn't take liking a status , inboxing , secret < PROPFIRST > , or a new year to show someone how you feel . \ 
These new statuses are getting preeeeetty pathetic . -.- 
First day back at school and I'm running on 4 hours of sleep and an energy drink ... Thank God it's shop week . :D 
Sitting in the cold , with a tab for Facebook and a tab for Tumblr both open at the same time , noming on animal crackers . It's official , I have no life . :D 
Thinks Facebook should stop wasting time making uneccessary changes and spend more time trying to function properly for once . :D 
If one more < PROPFEMALE > middle schooler thinks starting crap with me is cool , they're getting punched in the mouth . \ 
There , I said it gramatically correct this time . :D 
I could have sworn I already deleted all you Jersey Shore loving newsfeed rapers . .____. 
Despite crying due to stomache problems that hurt so bad it felt like stabby stabby , causing me to almost keel over on the floor , work today was A-okay ! :D 
Women only live longer than men because the kitchen is where the knives are . ;D 
Dear Winter , \ 
If you were a person , I would brutally murder you . \ 
Love , < PROPFIRST > :D 
If I suddenly went blind , would you still look in my eyes ? What happens when I grow old and all my stories have been told ? Would your heart still race for me ~ ? <3 
Gooottta love long hot showers before crawling under the covers . :3 Looking forward to tomorrow ~ <3 
Getting ready , school , the hanging out with < PROPFIRST > for the rest of the day ? I think so . >:D <3 
Amazing night ~ :3 And as if I wasn't in a good mood already , no school tomorrow ? Yes , please . >:D <3 
For once in my life , I'm actually jealous of the < PROPFEMALE > school district . .____. 
Joining the status ragage , but * ahem * ... NO SCHOOL TOMORROW , FTW ! >:D That makes 4 weeks of amazing in a row ~ <3

WELP , I'm gonna be bored getting ready for work until 2 , so let's do the thing all FB users do when they're bored : \Andrea thinks ... \ " ._____. " 
Woke up to the sounds of dad making breakfast , and realized I don't have work or school today . Today = epic win , I can sense it ! >:D 
Is hoping the snow today means it'll be clear tomorrow so that my < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > proportioned plans don't get destroyed by a < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > snowstorm . D:< 
Just cried during \Cloudy With A < PROPMALE > of Meatballs\ " ..... something's wrong here . .________. " 
Apparently I'm addicted to sex because I've kissed , and violence because I like a mystery series . \ 
This is why adults piss me off . -.- 
Amazing night with < PROPFIRST > ! >:D My face just hurts from laughing the entire way home ~ :p <3 
Am I the only one who actually WANTS to go to school tomorrow ? O , o 
One last thing before getting off here and heading to work : I love < PROPFIRST > Kerrigan . :D <3 \ 
That is all ~ 
I hate it when you can't tell the difference between a dark purple and black jelly bean until AFTER you put it in your mouth . ._____. 
Dear mum n dad , \ 
I don't complain when you listen to your music , let me listen to mine ? Kthanks . 
Dear Northeast , \

Plans for today : Cleaning some room , playing some Devil May Cry , aaaaaannd RELEASING THE KRAKEN . D:< \ 
HAH , I can actually say that now . :3

Amaaaaaaazing day ahead ~ ! :D Who needs football when I've got Netflix , Thanksgiving dinner , and a cuddle < PROPMALE > ? :p <3 
So I had a dream last night that school today was cancelled , only to wake up and find that it's not . \ 
Monday , you need a punch in the face . D:< 
Look up . See that cloud ? The one labeled ' Cloud 9' ? Well , if you look close enough , you can see that geek < PROPFIRST > Trochimiak dancing around on it . <3 
I hate it when a good mood drops like THAT . 
Just bit my tongue so hard blood pooled out . I'm just updating my status while I'm waiting for feeling to return to it . :D \

< /Geek moment > :D 
Never did I think the day would come where I would see < PROPFIRST > dance to < PROPFEMALE > Spears in my living room . I think < PROPMALE > is enjoying the veiw ~ ;D 
Is it bad that even when taken , I still don't really care for < PROPFIRST>'s Day ? I don't need a single day in the year to show love . You should be doing that everyday , anyways . :p ? 
Beautiful weather outside , awesome drawings , visiting daddy , and a plushie to fall asleep with tonight ? I think so . AWESOME dayso far ~ >:3 <3 
My alarm clock picks the worst days to just not go off . ._____. I actually WANTED to go in today . \ 
Craptastic mood activated . -.- 
Have you ever had such a good sneeze you ran up and hugged someone because it put you in such a good mood ... or is that just me ? O , o 
Why be a Negatron when you can be an OPTIMIST PRIME ? D:< 
It's been a while since I could look in a mirror and actually be pleased with the way I look ~ :3 <3 
In a kick-ass mood today . Preparing for a busy day at work tonight ? BRING IT . >:D 
Where did all this confidence suddenly come from ? Feels good ... I like it . >:D <3 
Since when did Square 1 become a Scene Convention ? -.- 
What's on my mind ? Unicorns , graffiti , napkins , laundry , gummy bears , airplanes , rainbows , and why the hell I have this weird taste in my mouth . \ 
You asked , Facebook . 
Aaaah , Bioshock and < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim ~ Feels good to play for hours on end again . :3 \ 
Hearing that little achievement DING is just the icing on this delicious nerdasm cake . >:D 
Playing Bioshock and baking muffins for < PROPFIRST > . >:D <3 \ 
But the question is : HOW DID THE XBOX GET IN THE KITCHEN ? 
I hope you realize that I'm giving up precious Bioshock time to get this paper done . \ 
The LEAST you could do was make it a video game so we could get achievements for it or something . ;D 
FINALLY finished with that stupid 20+ paragraph English paper . But here's the catch : I did it all without even opening the book . ;D \ 
Thank God for the internet . <3 
Gooootta love trying to get comfy in bed and falling off in the process . .____. \ 
On the bright side , gravity still works . :D 
Forgot to wash my Stop n Shop shirt , and now it smells like .... Stop n Shop . \ 
Maybe if I wear a bright yellow t-shirt , nobody'll notice . ;D 
Mmmmm , english muffin toaster pizzas . :3 Maybe some Assassin's Creed or Gears after , today's looking to be a gooood day ~ <3 
SO GAIZ , WE HAVE SCHOOL TOMORROW , TROLOLOLOLOL . 
I'm so very happy I have you ~ <3

Anemia : 1\ 
Andrea : Covered in blood . 
Currently smashing the crap out of my DS on the back patio . If I come into work with a maniacal expression on my face , ignore me . :D 
Food in my stomache , Asking < PROPFEMALE > shirt on my boddeh , and Oceans Deep ticket in my pocket ~ :3 <3 \ 
Now if only < PROPFIRST>'s car would be in front of my house . 
Tonight = WIN . That is all . 
Hi , my name's < PROPFIRST > Trochimiak , and I'm addicted to pizza bagels . 
Why is everybody so freaking negative lately ? .______. 
Actually got dad to listen to Oceans Deep ( BaKaBOM ! ) ... and he liked it . I FEEL SO ACHIEVED . : ' D ? 
I love days that are just ... what's the word ? Oh , that's right : Perfect . <3 :D 
Go to your profile . The first 5 friends in the sidebar are your team in the upcoming Zombie Apocalypse : Kriss < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > Donatelli , < PROPMALE > Santilli , and < PROPFIRST > Trifaro ... ZOMBIES . ARE GOING . DOWN . >:D 
Daylight Savings never fails to make me feel like\ 
A . ) I'm a time traveler\ 
B . ) We need a better way to measure time . \ 
Cuz I'm confused as all hell as to whether it's midnight or 1 in the morning right now . .____. 
Epic day with Kriss < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > Pag , and < PROPFIRST > Kerrigan ahead ! >:D \ 
Beastly + Starbucks carmachillo + mah posse = Recipe for an awesome Sunday ~ <3 
Actually had a pretty decent time at school today . :D <3 But now it's NAP TIME . \ 
Aka , the period high schoolers need more than preschoolers . D:< 
Is seriously considering donating a few hundred dollars to Japan . Earthquake , tsunamis , nuclear plant explosions , volcano , whirlpool ... nobody deserves such hell . :( 
So if this weekend goes the way I think it will , I might just die from an OD of happiness ~ <3 \ 
LOL , GEDDIT , SEE WUT I DID THERE ? 
Current mood : ASDFFGHJKKLHGFDSAL . <3 \ 
That is all . 
I WOULD spill coke on my crotch , causing me to walk around Stop n Shop for the rest of the night looking like I pissed myself . 
Hiccuping and sneezing at the same time = PAIN . O.O \ 
Best 3 days EVER start tomorrow ~ <3 
SO , Mrs. West's letting me bring in an Xbox next week to play because < PROPMALE>'s Inferno relates to the class . U MAD ? ;D \ 
Best weekend ever in the morning ~ <3

Back home from an amazing weekend , with amazing food/music , with an amazing person ~ <3 \ 
Yeah , I feel AMAZING . :3 
Ramen , The Venetia Fair , and working on a new Kraken painting to < PROPFEMALE > up in my room ? I think so . >:3 <3 
If I could reach up and hold a < PROPFEMALE > for every time you've made me smile , the entire evening sky would be in the palm of my hand ~ <3 
I think Poochie LITERALLY just ate my homework . ._______. 
Me : So , mum , this \Just Dance\ " game ? I'm gonna test it . Right now . And I will admit 
Got really freaked out cuz I thought the Xbox wasn't working ... when in reality I was just holding the PSP thinking it was the controller . ._____. LOL , IM'MA DERP . 
Aaaaahhh , finally home from a great day at work . :3 And home all day tomorrow for endless rounds of Just Dance 2 and Bulletstorm ? I think so . >:D <3 
Just when I think it's impossible to love you anymore than I already do , you go and prove me wrong . My heart beats for you ~ <3 
Mum pinches ass . I tell her I almost had a heart attack ... mum pinches ass again . 
Uuuuggggh , home sick . -.- On the bright side , moar Bulletstorm ? I think so ~ 
Blanket capes , finished Richards ' makeup test , Kashi food , Gears and Bulletstorm , and a < PROPMALE > to talk to . Best . Sick day . Ever . <3 
WHAT'S WITH ALL THESE POLLS AND WHY ARE THEY RAPING MY NEWSFEED ? 
Really freaking pissed off lately . Why do girls have to be so FRUSTRATING ? -.- 
I need a punching bag . Now . 
< PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > + < PROPFIRST > + lemon yogurt = Smile plastered across my face ~ <3 
Mother Nature , I am dissapoint . 
So for the past couple weeks I've been sweating/dancing myself dizzy and eating less sweets cuz I thought I gained 5 extra pounds .... only to realize today that the scale is just off by 5 pounds . ._____. FFFFFFF- 
Sucker Punch with < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFIRST > , then back to < PROPFEMALE>'s for catapult failing and the kickassery that is me pwning < PROPFIRST > at Just Dance 2 ? I think so . ;D <3
