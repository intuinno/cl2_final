Guess what he did ? He started chasing us ! Life Lesson : People do not like being told that they are not scary on Halloween . (: 
Oh , and I am also wondering what made Winn < PROPFEMALE > want to put lots of thank you stickers on my gatorades ....? And what made people think it's okay to let a little baby sit on a clearly unstable tractor ?

AHHH ! (: I got < PROPFEMALE > canes that look like < PROPFIRST > mouses ' head ! 
I do not see why people on my bus flipped to see my hair up . It's not like I never wear it up .... just not to school . Maybe it was just the bumps .. Mrs. White hates brushes and if you cook , hair goes up . (: 
Okay , so , < PROPFEMALE > are you wearing your hair up ? And how ? Cause I can't decide between ballerina bun or curly ponytail ....? Oh , and chorus performance tonight ! I taught < PROPMALE > how to dance to Hot Chocolate ant Archery !

No offense , Daddy , I'm just afraid of chainsaws . Just sayin ' . Archery meet in < PROPMALE > tomorrow , yay ! Maybe I'll wear the shirt from sixth grade .... cause we're just that cool . :)

Going to the beach . Yesterday was fun , got eated up by bugs , and then found Promm shoes . 
Curled my hair for my meeting at West Florida tonight , cos curly hair is professional hair , but I kinda slept on it , so now they look smushed , but interesting . :) I AM SO SUNBURNED ! 
Prom was awesome ! Had so much fun dancing ! My feet are killing me now , and my curls fell out , but it was SOOOO worth it ! Pictures soon , and then COD with Gunnar and < PROPFEMALE > . 
Everyone needs to wear purple today . Today is MPS awareness day , and it would mean so much and I would love you forever if you did.mpssociety.org: MPS I is a mucopolysaccharide disease that is relentlessly progressive and potentially fatal . MPS I has also been called Hurler , Hurler-Scheie and Scheie syndrome . . There is no cure for MPS diseases , but there are ways of managing and treating the problems they cause . 
Mommy is FINALLY awake . :) Prom pictures are up . 
It's Sunday , which means tomorrow I have school . Eeeww . :) 
Is really bored . Mummy slept all day , so no beach . Can't pick on Toeface cos she's over nextdoor . Hmm . Well , maybe we'll go shopping or something after daddy goes to bed . :) 
It's raining , it's pouring . Last night there was TONS of lightning ! Dr. Lambert's daughter's party today . :) I hope it stops raining , or else me and Toeface can't swim . 
Pool time . :) Me and my seal !.... once I blow it up . 
Watched UP last night . < PROPFEMALE > cute ! :) I have been exiled from the pool area , cos I was standing there cos I had just woken up . So daddy sent me in here . Ahh . :( 
Is not exiled from the pool anymore . In fact , Toeface has declared me < PROPFEMALE > . Personally , I'll settle for < PROPFEMALE > . :) 
It's the last day of school . DDDDDDD: NOO ! I guess pretending it won't come doesn't work . Don't get to see Ms. McGugin today , or Mr. Szyndler , and dude , those are my favorites ! Especially Ms. McGugin ! Ahh ! Only a half day too . :( I'ma miss school , alot . 
West Florida High School of Advanced Technology ( ughh so long ! ) get ready . The freshman class of 2014 just left middle school . :) 
The fact that I'm leaving < PROPFEMALE > forever for West Florida has not fully hit me yet . I'm glad . I don't think I'll be able to get used to not seeing some of my very favorite people everyday next year . But at least our < PROPMALE>'s doesn't have our oil yet . I made handprints in the sand . :) and soaked my capris . :) 
Iunno what I'm doing today . :) Mummy still has my phone ! Ahh ! We need to get that new charger . 
Won't have my phone for maybe another week , since mummy has it . < PROPFEMALE > . You can talk to me here , myspace , or my house line . Maybe . 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > has 174 friends . 51 of them are male , 103 are female , and 20 are confused about their gender . ( HA ! So who is confused ? ) 
Stupid knife . Daddy's bad knife cut my finger ! 
< PROPFEMALE > loves Hannie MOST ! 
Note : Don't put < PROPFEMALE > soap in the dishwasher . No plans today . :) Except pool . And clean for Friday . Friday will be fun :) 
I have taught Toeface how to play chicken in the pool . :) Unfortunately , I don't think she understands that I can't breathe underwater for fifty bajillion minutes !

I just realized that this weekend is the fourth of July ! I wonder if we'll do fireworks this year ?

So ..... people cussing every other word after I've requested for them to please stop , I'm a lady , and they coninue to do it ? Not making you any cooler in my book . 
I guess I've been speaking alien all day long , cos everything I've said to anybody has been either taken wrong , misunderstood , or turned around . So , I think I'll stick to not talking until I finish re-learning English . 
alkjdfhlafdhlaskjhfd ! I'm gonna go wrap special people presents ! Except not mummy's cos she doesn't get hers till Thursday ! Hahahahaha , mummy ! :) 
Super Paper < PROPFIRST > ? I think so ! :)

Watching all these college football players try to pull off Polomalu hair ... sorry boys , not happenin ' . Only he can work it , so stop trying , you look silly . :)

Steelers are going to the Superbowl ! I knew it , yay ! :) My wonderful football boys ! 
Pretty Little Liars isn't even like the books , so it's really not fun to watch . Maybe they should've consulted < PROPFEMALE > Shepard . :/

Here we go Steelers ! :) 
Forget < PROPFIRST > . Heinz is my boy ! :) 
Dear Greenbay , please turn off your house alarms . It uses valuable beating up time to disable them . Oh , and don't worry . Steelers will win back our trophy next year ! Not yours at all truly , < PROPFEMALE > . :) 
The Itsy Bitsy Spider is the most inspirational song that I have ever heard . It's full of such deep , thoughtful meaning , and it can be used to inspire a variety of people at numerous ages . Therefore , I think it should be taught to everybody in the world . 
Happy Valentine'r Day everybody . :) 
I love how my birthday is like , two weeks after school starts , but that means no first semester Driver's < PROPMALE > for me . 
I love how painful these retainers are . They must get so much joy out of letting me know that this is punishment for abandoning them for two days ..
