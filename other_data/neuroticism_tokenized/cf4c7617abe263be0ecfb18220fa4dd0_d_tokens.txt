lonely . 

going to work ... 
besides some unnecessary annoyances , I am quite happy . 
Still have a long way to go but Im glad things are finally moving along . 
feeling better from yesterday but still in some pain . Not sure what is going on ... just hoping it keeps getting better . 
sore , exhausted , and tired . But Im happy ! 
I love showers and I love arts . \ 
I love Love ... but not all its parts . \ 
I love my family and my son . \ 
I love my life despite some of the shit I've done . \ 
I love to cuddle especially in big comfy beds . \ 
I love to talk and get inside your head . \ 
I love a lot and I love with all my heart . \ 
But there is still an empty space for your love to start ! <3 ~ Me ( 1-1-2011 ) 
\Live like there is a tomorrow . \"< 3 " 
Im finding that if I just go with the flow , things will go a lot smoother .... life is too short ... why live trying to make everything perfect . Things are the way they are and if things progress and get better .... WONDERFUL . Other than that I really dont give a shit at the moment . :) 
wishing it was summer already ! I want the outdoors !

The mind is a powerful thing , mine as well is twisted and lost in the confusion of deciding how to complete the picture that got torn and is probably missing a few pieces .

It's soooo nice out but I feel so drained , all I wanna do is crawl in my bed ... but I will not waste the sunshine . < PROPFEMALE > will seize the day !... some what ... =) 
If your mom and dad are your heros , whether you are blessed to have them with you , or they are angels in heaven , copy and paste this with their names . ( < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > ) ? ? ? ? 
I hate having to waiting for something that I feel I already know ..... 
Really hoping this flu thing goes away soon ! I am sick and tired of being sick and tired ! 
Great Weather + < PROPFEMALE > Not Feeling Well = Bull Sh ! t .... too drained to go outside and play ! =/ 
Theres a thousand fish in the sea . And there is a fish for everyone . Ive had some of those fish and they weren't it . I miss a fish very much . Sorta have a fish but not really so that must not be the right fish . So Im wondering if its a problem with the pond Im in or if its what Im trying to catch them with ! Ugh .... 
I love it when the weather is like this , because even though my mouth hurts from wisdom teeth , I am in a really good mood . Sun and Rainbows are so magical ! =) 
Im happy but there is a piece missing .... will it be filled soon ? Try to maintain positive energy . I'm gonna start meditating again . 
I need to go to sleep ! 
What a wonderful day to go to the zoo ! I got my Vitamin D I was thristing for . SUMMER TIME !! =D 
I figure just not thinking about it would be best but I'm finding it very hard not to think about it .... 
My tummy attacked me today ! Not good . Other than that my day wasn't bad . 
Wondering what it is I have to do to get my way .... 
Why can't people just step up to the plate and let me know how they feel ?!?!? I need a better word then insanity right now ! 
Supercross was a really good time . Will have pictures up soon . 
I feel myself getting happier everyday . When its complete I hope it will stay . 
I will be happy ! No one can stop me ! =) 
I think people should have to take an IQ test to work at a restaurant . ( Hint : low IQ , NO hire ! ) 
I don't know what it is that makes me have to try . 
This rainbow is contently bright right now ! =) 
\I've seen a < PROPMALE > man beg ... seen a good man sin ... seen a tough man cry ... seen a loser win .... seen a sad man grin .... heard a honest man lie .... \"" 
SOoooo its lookin like < PROPFEMALE > has to find herself a new job ! Damn evil demons invading this wonderful world of ours . 
Slept too long today but imagine it was needed ... Feeling lonely today ... 
I am so terribly sad . I wish I could jump in the ocean to wash away all my tears . 
Why do I surround myself with the craziest weirdest people I can find ?.... oh yeah they make me feel a < PROPFEMALE > bit sane . XD 
Just when you think ... maybe this is the bottom and Ill be heading back up to the top .... it takes time .... BOOM the devil laughs in your face and says .... I always have something else up my sleeve .. 
\Where can I ran to ? Where can I hide ? Who will turn to ? Now Im in a virgin state of mind . \"" 
\and i am so lost for words and i am so overwhelmed . \"" 
If the walls came tumbling down , and everything is in ruins , I will still stand strong . I will make it though anything anyone throws at me . Everything happens for a reason . Don't worry , be happy . 
If your Mom is \ 
your hero , whether you are blessed to have your Mom still with you , \ 
or if she has gone to be with the Lord , copy and paste this with her \ 
name : < PROPFIRST > Iliff . Love always ? your daughter < PROPFEMALE > . 
Got an interview tomorrow .... cross your fingers for me ! =) 
I'm having a hard time eating . I don't know if its nerves or what . Any ideas on how to help ? Best foods ( easiest ) to start eating again . I hate this feeling . I feel so weak but I'm not even able to eat a whole sandwich ... =/ 
Slept in .... Felt good ... still having a hard time eating .... still need more opinions on what to eat ! I think I'm gonna just make this a day of movies on demand ! LOL Lazy Time ! 
\My body aches for your presence . My heart aches for your love . My soul aches for your fire . I ache for your touch . \ " -Me " 
I love seeing people push when it says pull ! LMAO . 
Tired of feeling lonely and horny . Guess that's what I get for thinking a piece of ass can be girlfriend material ... 
\I wanna cuddle . I wanna kiss . I wanna hold you . I wanna feel that bliss . I'll give it all I got . I'll be who I am . I'll show you what I'm worth . This is not a scam . \ " ~ Me " 
Self therapy is failing miserably ... Tomorrow night couldn't come fast enough ! I just wanna DANCE !!!

might not be that beautiful or the \ 
sexiest ..... Nor have the perfect body . I may not be anyones first \ 
choice . But I am a GREAT choice . I don't pretend to be someone else \ 
cause I am too good at being me . I might not be proud of the things I've\ 
done . But I am proud of who I am today . Take me as I am or don't take \ 
me at all . ~ copy ... and paste this as your status if you love to live ur\

wishes it would STOP raining and the sun would come out so I can start on the tanning process ! 
Soooo hungry ... gonna go find me some food to eat ... since I let my sausage go bad (* damnit *) ... 
I'm so bored ... I'm gonna work out than watch a movie (* hopeful this one will be better than the last *) ... Text me if you wanna chat ( IM BORED ! ) 
just watched The Unborn ... pretty good ... main character was very sexy ! LOL Helped to keep my attention . ;) But now I'm bored again ... what to do what to do .... 
YAY < PROPMALE > will be home soon ! =) 
Thinking about watching a movie ... not sure what I want to watch yet tho ... waiting for Will and < PROPFEMALE > to get here ... 
Over Her Dead Body it is ... never seen it ... previews looked funny ... hope it is .. 
I thought Over Her Dead Body was hilarious ! Good Romantic Comedy . 
pretty exciting ... second movie ( 5ive Girls ) \ 
where I actually watched the whole thing ... didn't bust out the \ 
camera ... sorry for those that enjoy my awesome pictures ! ;) And today it\ 
is sunny ... so maybe the tanning sessions start today ... after having \ 
lunch with my big sis , < PROPFEMALE > Iliff-Collier ! =) 
Went to El Maguey with my big sis , @ Janice\ 
Iliff-Collier . Tanned for a little over a half hour ( than ran out of \ 
sunshine in my background ... * damn trees *) and now going to make a new \ 
photo album ! YAY ! = 
Went to El Maguey with my big sis , < PROPFEMALE > Iliff-Collier . Went tanning ... only for 40 minutes tho =/ ( ran out of sunshine in my background ) ... just posted new photo album ( Can't see a tan yet ... but I didn't figure ) . Hoping next session will be TOMORROW ! =) * Praying for sunshine ! * 
Wow I must gone crazy ... why am I typing background when I think backyard ? Weird ! Anyway !!!!! More pictures of < PROPMALE > and me in the backYARD ! 
if you want a bit of a giggle check out my favorite quotes . I should have started this a long time ago but I will continue to remember to write down stuff < PROPMALE > says . Enjoy . =) 
So I'm gonna start doing some projects around here until I find a damn job ! I'm getting so bored ! 
Went through my old stuff ... pulled all photographs out ... hopeful my mom installs her scanner so and I'll put even younger pictures of < PROPMALE > on here plus some oldies from when I was a kid ... if you known me a long time I probably have a picture of you when you were younger ... let me know if you do NOT want me to post any of you ... if not .... they are soooo going on here . BAHAHAHAHA ! =) 
I think I'm gonna be able to tan this weekend !!! YAY for sunshine !!!! =) Slept in today than cleaned ... boring day ... kinda wanna go do something ... 
slept in again .... bad thing since I slept too long and couldn't get in another tanning session =( but I was productive today .... gave Phebs and < PROPMALE > their baths and flea treatment ! Went to Walmart ( I dislike that place very much ! ) I will not sleep in tomorrow ( well I'm gonna wake up with enough time to tan ... which means I have to be outside tanning by noon ! I should be able to do ! =) 
Slept in again , tanned for an hour , showered , and now I am extremely hungry and bored . I guess I'll see if I can find a movie to watch .... ugh .... I dislike watching movies and not cuddling with someone ! =/ Oh well at least I have < PROPMALE > . 
Just watched Karla .... very disturbing movie but it was a good movie to watch . Based on a true story about a couple that kidnapped , raped , and murdered girls . Sad but I recommend watching it if you haven't , its insight to how easily some people can be deceiving , heartless , and just plain wrong . 
took some Pamperin ( so now my cramps are pretty much gone ) , ate some pizza rolls and worked out ... I really need more to do .... I'm bored again ... waiting for < PROPMALE > to get here ... 
Wrestled with < PROPMALE > , did quizes while he watched Spy Kids , gave him a bath , put him to bed .... bored again .... gonna look for another movie to watch ... I feel another review coming in the near future .... 
watched The Black Cat .... a disturbing short film about < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > Poe and how he goes crazy because of a black cat . Good little movie .... entertaining .... but I love < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > Poe . =) 
This fucking blows ... I can't sleep at all . I have been laying in bed for about 3 hours now ! BOO !!!! Insomnia sucks ! =/ 
soooooo excited ! Got a call from a job !!!!! YAY !!!! I hope I have it ! I will be finding out tonight ! 
Watched Restraint , pretty good movie I would have to say ... has the main vampire , < PROPMALE > , from TrueBlood in it . Went tanning for about a hour and 10 minutes ( my mom Tryme Anytime says she sees no change what so ever ! BOO ) . Now I'm gonna watch The Secret , a movie recommended to me by < PROPFEMALE > Trott . 
I just watched The Secret .... and recommend that EVERYONE watch this . I see it as the best way to breed peace and happiness . Be Happy ! I'm so thankful for the loving family that I have .... the people that I surround myself with are so beautiful ! =) 
\Energy flows where the attention goes . \ " -From The Secret " 
I have the job ... just waiting to see when I'm gonna start training . YAY ! ~!~!~!~ ! Time to watch a movie and crash ... didn't sleep much last night ! 
hanging out at Kristin's ... waiting for her to be done with this manager meeting . 
watched The Secret ( the movie not the documentary ) ... it was a really good movie . Interesting ... Mom and daughter get into a car accident ... mother's spirit somehow goes into the daughter's body . Good all the way through . 
went out and about with Rachel ... than added Will to the mix . Hanging with the Boog now . 
watched the first half of Tin Man ( great so far ) , tanned for a hour , posting pics , than getting some food in my belly and watching the second half of Tin Man . 
well just found out that Tin Man is 3 episodes not 2 so I still have 1 more to watch ... The second one was even better than the first so I'm excited to watch the third . 
Tin Man was awesome ! Very interesting twist on the story of Wizard of Oz . 
watching So You Think You Can Dance , on auditions ... which isn't as good but there has been some people already that I'm excited to watch on this show . I love Dance ! 
got to tan again ! Thank you sun ! Gonna hangout with < PROPFEMALE > Lissner tonight ! Should be a groovy time ! BAHAHA .... I need to eat something ... 
I found out that my watch is slowly dying ... so yesterday when I tanned , I tanned longer than I usually do ... and now I'm pretty burnt ... not too bad though ... it should fade into a tan in a couple days but it sucks right now ! 
BBQ with the family . =) 
gonna try out The Dresden Files : Season 1 ... sounds interesting enough ... guess I will see ... boooooring .... wish I could be on water right now ! Soon soon . =) 
The Dresden Files is very awesome so far .... already on episode 8 ! 
Slept in today . Burn on tummy is fading into tan ( YAY) ! Showered and now going to enjoy the rest of Season 1 The Dresden Files . 
started watching Sanctuary ... pretty interesting ... kinda slow first episode but has potential . 
going to be a very boring day and I don't have any pot ( if anyone wants to donate or smoke me out ! haha ) .... watched < PROPFEMALE > last night with < PROPMALE > LaFlamme ... it was pretty good ... I didn't like that March Hare was a bad guy though . All in all it should be recommended if you like < PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland . 
finished watching the first season of Sanctuary . It was great but damn do I want to know what is gonna happen ... really left me hanging ... sooooo boorreeedd !!!!!!! 
Soooo not sure what nights it will be yet but I'm back at Redbirds ! Whenever I figure out when I'm working ... I better see you 21 and ups there !

This is the only time I hate being a female ! If men are so tough why is it that women are the ones that have to go through so much pain ? Riiiiight .... I'd like to see a big strong man deal with this BS ! HA 
A real parent makes sacrifices in life to \ 
ensure their children are happy , healthy , well taken care of , and \ 
would do anything for them . They always come first , always \ 
have and always will . A parent loves their children unconditionally \ 
no matter what they have done .... they are everything to them ... Put this as\ 
your status if your a devoted parent ! I <3 my Boogie ! 
I'm glad this place doesn't open until August . I AM going to apply to 54th Street tomorrow . I keep running into something .... but I'm making it there tomorrow , for sure . 
< PROPMALE > destroyed my room . * shakes head * 
My hearts in the past ... my mind is determining the future ... and I'm stuck with this present thats worse then grandma's knitted christmas sweater with a reindeer and a < PROPFEMALE > on it . 
I think I'm gonna give up on this relationship thing ... I don't think anyone should be with me anyway ... 
Going to Redbirds Sportscafe tonight for < PROPFIRST > Hoke's Birthday Party ! Should be great fun ! 
Had fun . Done for the night . Hope you all like the pictures . Much Love . Good night . 
I'm gonna take a nap . Zzzzz 
I <3 showers . 
Actually fell asleep at a decent time last night , how exciting . Going to apply to another job , than off to the zoo with my boogie , < PROPFEMALE > Lissner , HayHay , and < PROPMALE > . 
How can sleep be such a difficulty task for someone that loves to do it so much ? 
I'm exhausted . I think I'm gonna be able to sleep tonight . > 3-Dzzz 
Lazy day . Gonna watch So You Think You Can Dance and American Pie : The Book of Love . 
Went to see The Last Airbender 3D with < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > . It was a cool movie ... can't wait for the next one to come out . 
I had a great time hanging out with < PROPFIRST > Zerjav last night ! Than chillin with < PROPFEMALE > Lissner , < PROPFIRST > Holt , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > , and a few others for < PROPFEMALE>'s \OMG I'm 21 now morning\ " . Gonna go out to Fast < PROPFIRST>'s for her birthday get together in a little bit than who knows from there . Happy Happy Birthday to my best friend < PROPFEMALE > ! YAY you are finally 21 damnit ! " 
My whole body hurts ! 
Not feeling very well . But , < PROPFIRST > Zerjav is coming to see me tonight ... so that should make me feel better . =) 
< PROPFIRST > Zerjav made me feel a lot better last night ! =) I'm lucky I met him . <3 
Off to apply to jobs . I hate this process but it must be done . 
It would be a very bad idea for me to drive with a gun in the car . ( Reasoning ... if I did ... little old black man in the pacifica wouldve be shot up ! ) Old people shouldn't have the right to drive ... unless tested and are capable of not being a complete freakin moron ! 
So ready for this weekend ! =) 
Had a great weekend with < PROPFIRST > Zerjav ! <3 
Even tho I am in pain ( wisdom teeth again ! ) I am very happy .... thanks to < PROPFIRST > Zerjav ! <3 
Pray that I get this job ! Please do the same if you love me and don't want me to suffer anymore . Thank you . <3 
Once again another great weekend with my sweetheart , < PROPFIRST > Zerjav ! <3 
My life is going pretty freakin awesome .... now if only I could get a job .... my life would be damn near complete ! =) 
Laundry and cleaning day .... oh what fun ! 
Ok ... Im ready for this weekend to be here already . 
YAY ... I finally get to pack up so I can spend the weekend with my gorgeousness , < PROPFIRST > Zerjav ! <3 
it's such a bummer when you're horny and your partner is not . * Thumbs down . * 
I\ 
will be myself ... no matter what . This is who I am . It fills me with joy\ 
that it's me that makes you happy . I am enough for you . As you are \ 
enough for me . <3 
is sad . =( 
My goodness , I need a job so very badly . 
I can't help it ... I miss him . 
All I want to do is sleep next to < PROPFIRST > Zerjav ... but boys need their boy time . All I can hope is that he is staying out of trouble but having fun . 
I don't even know how to explain the amount of disappointment I feel right . I wish someone would actually give me a chance ... they would be pleasantly surprised . I'm not out to hurt no one . I'm a gently authentic soul . 
I'm done . I give up . I shouldn't have to work so hard to keep a relationship going . Peace . 
Sad ... even though I shouldn't be ... I still am . =( 
Friends are a great help . I'm so lucky to have a few that are great . Good night . <3 
made for better and bigger things . 
There are unfortunate events that must fall into place to make your life better . When one door closes another opens . Leave the past , absorb the present , and embrace the future . Life is what you make it . Live it , love it , and hold on ( it's a bumpy ride ) . =) 
Well , I got work friday and all next week , filling in at the Dry Cleaner . Hopefully after that I'll have a new job . Maybe I'm finally gonna be able to get back to normalcy . 
Had a great time talking and hanging out with my old friend < PROPFIRST > Surtin . Glad he is back in my life . =) 
Had a great night again . Have a smile on my face . =) 
Focusing on me and my family . <3 
So tired . All I want to do is cuddle and watch a movie . But noooo .... no one to cuddle with and I have to make dinner . Ugh . 
I tackled < PROPFIRST > Mays ! Twice .... the second time he was trying to tackle me but I won ! HAHAHA . Victory is mine !

If you want something badly enough , you do what needs to be done to keep it going . 
I must become the me I want to be , before someone can like me for me . <3 
You can go ahead and try to reach for the stars , I just want to be able to reach out in front of me . <3 
A\ 
true friend doesn't care when you're broke , what you weigh , if your \ 
house is a mess , about your past , or if your family is filled with \ 
crazies ... they love you for who you are . A true friend can go long \ 
periods of time without speaking and never question the friendship . \ 
............... Repost if u have at least one true friend . They will know\ 
who they are ;)

Going to orientation in a few minutes . Hope it's not too boring . 
WOOHOO ! I start working next week . How freakin exciting ! =) And got to talk to someone I haven't talked to in a very long time . I'm genuinely getting happier . 
~ This will never end , I knew it from the start . So until it happens again , it will remain in my heart . ~ <3 
Had a good night last night . Now time to relax ... mostly likely sleep a little more . Never know what the future holds . 
I'm ready to start working already . And I should probably eat something . =) 
Ugh ... its starting to get cold out . =( Its not bad right now ... but it just lets me know \Hey its going to get stupid cold soon haha . \ " Grrr " 
Had a good day . Played outside with < PROPMALE > and my dad . Made dinner . Now I'm escaping to me super comfy bed . ~ The more scared you are the more you should do it . ~ <3 
~ Life is not like a movie , you should be living it , not watching it pass by . ~ <3 
< PROPMALE > can ride his bike without training wheels ! My baby is growing up . 
First day of working ! Than going to see < PROPFIRST > Lissnerjam out with his band . Work again in the morning . My life is going to be busy again WOOHOO ! ( That's a serious woohoo , not a sarcastic woohoo . ) haha 
Working .... and I like it . =) The little things in life . <3 
So tired . So proud . So living life . <3 
I'm sore and kinda wish I had someone to cuddle up with to watch a movie ... 
I like it on the floor . 
\What < PROPFEMALE > are you on ? \ " \ " I'm on the cover . \"" 
Sore ... but enjoying life ! =) 
So sick ... no bueno . =( 
Feeling better ... can't wait to sleep in tomorrow . =) 
Last day off was Tuesday ... next day off is Wednesday .... closing tonight ... really can't wait until Wednesday ! Tired .... but life is going good . If only I had someone to enjoy it with besides mini me ( < PROPMALE > ) . =) 
\You smell good .... you smell REALLY good . \ " Its weird how a little compliment can make your day better . =) " 
Mom's turn to watch TV .... YAY finally . 
So I had to leave work early to get < PROPMALE > from school because of a small rash on his face ... and now I have to take him to the doctor to get a note that it is not contagious . Ugh 4.5 hours off my paycheck grrrr ! But I do hope its not contagious . ( Life of a mother ) 
All good ... Derek can go to school tomorrow ... and I am going to bed . Zzzzz -.- 
If you hate on people and pick on them just to hurt them because they are some how different ... you should just kill yourself now . Thank you . =) 
going to Creepworld with < PROPFEMALE > Lissner and a few others . Not too excited that there is pretty sure a clown section . I don't want to have a panic attack . 
No bueno for Creepyworld . At least until they remove the clown section . 
I feel like I'm being cursed for getting birth control . =( 
Wish I could get myself in a better mood . 
Well my spirits are higher but my arm is still messed up . 
I wish he was closer .... but than maybe it would make it too good to be true . <3 
I may not be the most beautiful , smartest , most accomplished , most perfect , or first choice . But , I AM a great choice . I won't pretend to be someone I'm not , because I'm happy just being me . I might not be proud of some things in the past , but I AM proud of who I am ... today & I VALUE you for who YOU are today . Take me as I am , for the positive , or watch me walk away ! 
Why is it that I find one of the greatest people and they are thousands of < PROPMALE > away ? 
I've carried life within my body . I've slept with a baby on my chest . I havekissed\ 
boo boos , been puked on , pee'd on , & poo'd on . Spent sleepless \ 
nights in a rocking chair . But I wouldn't have it any other way ! My body\ 
isn't magazine perfect , my hair is always a mess , but when ... I look in \ 
the mirror I see a mom , and there is no greater honor or blessing . Make this your status if you're proud to be a mom . 
I am so thankful for my beautiful baby boy , who is now 5 today ... and I am also very thankful for my wonderful parents < PROPFIRST > Thrasher-Iliff and < PROPFIRST > Iliff . <3 Happy Thanksgiving everyone ! 
Snowing on Thanksgiving . Geez . At least its pretty . 
Thanksgiving dinner was very good .... now onto birthday presents and birthday cake . =)

I want to find that one person that besides gravity is what holds me to this earth . That one person that makes me whole . 
child says to his mom , \Mommy 
=) 
What's a girl to do ?.... 
Life is like having a kid .... when everything is quiet and peaceful ... you have a feeling something bad is lurking around the corner . 
I must have been a horrible person in my past life ... that's all I can come up with ... 
Grrrrrrrrrr 
How can something that feels so right ... be so wrong ? 
I really do try to fight it ... 
Just watched Howl's Moving Castle ( fantastic btw ) with < PROPFIRST > Miller ( my sunshine ) and his boyfriend < PROPFIRST > . =D 
So I got kind of a job interview Friday morning .... should bring in more bucks ! HOLLA ! But I will of course stay with my fantastic McDonald's Crew ... but will cut back my hours ... well cross your fingers and wish me good luck on advancing to more money !!!! =) 
Lets see how creative my FB friends are ... Leave me a 1 word comment that best describes me using the THIRD letter of your FIRST name ... It can only be 1 word ... Then copy and paste this to your wall so I can leave a word about you ... Dont just post a word and not copy , thats no fun . =P 
This year is going fantastically so far ... hope it stays that way . <3 
I'm kinda scared to be this happy . =) 
i got my new phone ! =) 
Having strep throat sucks . =/ 
<3 I'll only be there if you really want me to be there . <3 
My room is so fresh and so clean clean ( I feel productive) ! =) Sickness is going away ( Not as fast as I would like but its going ) .... I get to hangout and cuddle with < PROPFIRST > tonight ( The comfortableness I have been missin')! Couldn't ask for more right now . Great day so far and only getting greater ! <3 
Got to make sure I don't mess this one up . =) 
Off to work ... first day back ... out 5 days !!!!! Can't believe I'm so happy to go to work . LOL =) 
So nice to get out of the house and go to work . Even though my throat started bothering me again .... I have to talk too much at work LOL . =) 
Being continually woken up by a wailing 5 year old is no bueno ... I no like when my little man is in pain . =( 
Why not go for .... not like anything could possibly disappoint me anyway . 
Nerve conduction and EMG today ! =( Happy that I'm moving in the right direction to getting this fixed but scarred about the tests . So lucky my best friend < PROPFEMALE > Lissner is amazing and is willing to go with me ! =) 
That was stupid . Had to go get shocked ... a lot ( because I'm always flippin cold , so my temp was messing up the test ) ... and in the end ... find out .... NOTHING . Great on to another test .... fantastic ! Ugh .... I just want it to go away ... 
Great ! More snow ... I'm so excited .... NOT ! 
Very bad day ! First , wake up sick as f *** again ... go to the E.R. Second , driving home , get on the 70 and flip my dad's truck . So Thankful Im alive because I was wearing my seat belt ... I want thank the off work EMT lady and < PROPFIRST > the Army man who stayed with me until the firefighters came to cut me out . 
I flipped my truck over and over again last night ... I wonder when sleeping will become easier . 
I'm stuck with a gangster walk for now lol . 
So I have really bad luck because I have all these obstacles thrown at me but than I have really good luck because I make it though them in one piece .... So am I good luck or bad luck ??? One of the many questions swirling around in my mind . =) 
~ It's almost impossible to forget about the past ... but don't let it hinder your present or dim your future . ~ 
Yay ! Just one more W-2 and I can file my taxes ... which implies me getting my record cleaned and my car legalized ! Life will get better in time ... happy that I still have time to make it better . Live life !? 
No one could break my heart bad enough to make me stop loving . No one could try to belittle me and take away my courage/strength . I have decided that I will have control of me . I wish more people could do the same way . 
\It makes sense if you don't think about it . \ " LOL " 
I'm slowly going back to numb ... and unfortunately I don't really care ... 
How can anything be sure if tomorrow isn't ?
