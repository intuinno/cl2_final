Happy New Year everyone 

Captain's Log , Day 1 : I seem to have logged on here again out of curiousity . Many creatures seem to inhabit this space , now to catalog them and determine their status as friend or foe . 
Wok = More awesome than you can imagine O.O 
And now I end my night declaring that I am possibly the slowest texter in the WORLD lol 
Yeah ... I'm so naturally nocturnal it's just not even funny . Gotta be up in 4 hrs for work and I'm still going strong , so lame lol . 
<--- Needs to find her camera . 
Good day so far :) Bought random things , ate some thai food , ran around the park throwing some ball , up next is karaoke and alcohol ! All on maybe 2 hrs of sleep lol . 
... Need ... COFFEE 
Now for a day of vegging out ** munches on a salad ** 
Home from work now , excited that I'm going to martial arts tonight since it's been so long I know my body's going to have hell to pay . But at the same time I'm kind of depressed , I guess it's b/c of the going ons of work , nothing severe , just kind of bleh . 
So after watching the class today I decided that ... I Need a Workout < PROPMALE > ! lol , feeling intimidated atm :) 
Not sure why I've been such an impulsive jerk lately , maybe I'm just adjusting to the physical stress I've been adding to myself ? Hopefully I stop soon 
Still feeling beat up from class , regardless I'm charging back in there tomorrow lol ! 
I have a couple of decent ideas for photos ... maybe I should actually try to hunt down my phone ; kind of tired of looking at my profile pic 
Waiting patiently for metrocon ... still have about a month , and haven't figured out who I want to dress up as >.< \ 
\ 
Any ideas anyone ? 
Imo , smartly = weak adjective 
Airsoft & Martial Arts ! Fun day ahead :) 
Oh man , I'm exhausted . It's been a fantastic day though , airsoft went well , then martial arts right after was a little bit of a strain but in a good way , on top of that we just went out to eat at Thai Pan Alley with some friends which is conveniently located right on the beach . :) Now to veg for a bit before crashing . 
There ! I finally threw some photos up ... granted they're mostly from a year ago , and I'm not in a single one of them but hey , they're there 
Messed around with the violin a bit , twas fun ! :) 
So tired , so hungry 
Kind of nervous about the belt ceremony tomorrow/today ( since it's 1 a . m . ) I'm pretty sure it'll go fine , but I was warned by my instructor that he likes to have the adult's do performances for the kids and their parents ... hope I'm in decent form . 
<--- experimenting ; 9 lbs worth of weights for about 9 hrs now , just have to wear them for 45 < PROPFEMALE > more , and then we'll see how class goes :) 
Meh , stayed up late again tonight , time to put the needle and thread away and sleep lol 
Is it normal to have you parental figure be your greatest opponent in life ? In my case it'd be my father when it comes to health type things and mother in attitude . I guess it could be the hero type syndrome where you want to be most like , actually surpassing them in those things . 
Curiousity : What do y'all think of twitter ? 
Depth of , in , or from perception ? Maybe vice-versa ? 
meh , 2 days into vacation and haven't started working out as planned yet ... oh well , at least the car's back in running condition 
Now @ 216 , lost 29 and only 26 more to go ! 
Wow , this was a really long but fun day :) Airsoft , then lunch , and on top of that we ended up rushing off to the metrocon b/c I had gotten my dates confused and thought it was next week lol . Unfortunately , I forgot my camera in the car , so no pics of people dressing up :( 
* sigh * It's Monday and I'm bored ... 
Comic con seems like it would've been fun to go to 
It feels like Christmas !!! 
It's the weekend and I'm awake earlier than on a weekday ! 
Class was awesome tonight with help from my classmate < PROPMALE > , I'm still looking forward to jogging tomorrow though :) 
Oy , sore throat from singing incorrectly during karoake lastnight , still feels worth it though . Now to prep for tennis :) 
I should not be allowed near the quizzes on here ... Ever ! I think I've done 4 or 5 in the last few minutes , thankfully I don't bother posting all of them lol 
Meep ... I've been tagged ! 
how does milk go from perfectly fine to instant bad ... like really bad , while staying in the fridge and not being past it's expiration ... looks like it's dry cereal for breakfast 
Day numero uno on THE PATCH ... put in a terrible spot so it's starting to want to come off , but doing good so far I think lol . Tomorrow I'll position it somewhere not as active lol . And , I BOUGHT MILK ! 
Just got back from Jowalking with < PROPFEMALE > , we're definitely improving :) 
If you have a question , ask it . If you run out of questions then you should expand your horizons to gain new questions . :) When you run out of horizon , well ... I guess you're just a know it all then aren't you . 
Day 2 ... doing ok so far ??? I guess in this case it's in the eye of the beholder . I've neither exploded nor imploded , so all is well in the land I suppose :D 
The beginning of day 8 ... * sigh * 
So I've basically killed off almost all of my apps , not like I have time to mess around on them anymore anyway . Just started the gym on Wednesday , and my arms are really sore lol . In any case I'm off to work on my legs tonight . Wish me some luck ! :) 
Had a really fun but really tiring day today , airsoft then class then T'asia! Thai food is always a nice treat after running around . 
still feeling sick , just have to hold it off till Saturday afternoon lol 
i'm wiped , and running at about 90% since this morning , ( healthwise ) , time to OD on some more orange juice and crash . Testing went alright , I could've/should've done better , but at least I have something to work on . Btw , day 22 on the nicotine patch and down to 195 lbs . 
* sigh * I miss karaoke night 
I don't think I care for the taste of the mojitos ... then again it's a premix , so maybe they just failed lol 
\What's in a name ? That which we call a < PROPFEMALE > by any other name would smell as sweet . \ " - \ " Romeo & Juliet\ " - Shakespeare " 
The pen is mightier than the sword , but what is the keyboard to the pen ? Is this just going to turn into a game of rock , paper , scissors ? 
It's been such a great weekend , I just don't want it to end ... maybe that's why I'm still awake . 
The fish was delicious ! I wish I had more :( 
I feel dissatisfied with my performance in class tonight :( hopefully I'll do better next time . 
I don't get to shoot/be shot at by anyone today :( 
Yay ! It's done ! I made a big ole bowl of ambrosia for work tomorrow >.< now I think I'm going to be on a sugar high for like a week lol 
what will this first day bring ? I can only hope that all goes well 
Hmmmm no gym tonight ... now what ? 
So , in the last 6 months , I've lost 65 lbs , quit smoking after 11-12 years but it still doesn't feel like enough ... sometimes being human is annoying ... 
Some things are just so blatantly obvious that you just have to laugh :) 
Trans Siberian Orchestra was awesome ! :) I really enjoyed it , the music & the light display were amazing , only the instrumentals though , when it came to the singers and such , I could've done without . 
Roar ! 
<-- has been taking photos of the lunar eclipse every half hour since 1 a . m ... still going strong . 
To all of my friends that I work with ... I'm apologizing ahead of time for my lack of awareness I'll be having today :) Couldn't miss the eclipse+solstice combo , I'm sure you all understand right ? ** big sad eyes ** 
I'm slowly building up little resolutions ... I think I'm at 4 now ? I think it's best if I don't count . 
and now , off to class :) 
* sigh * yet another night that I fail to sleep anywhere near early enough . 
Congratulations to those who survived testing tonight ! 
Ok , now I'm just upset ... changing the zodiac on us like that . Just b/c of a little gravity over thousands of years ended up shifting things . Why couldn't the world just stay flat ! 
Thai food for lunch was good ... that's one good thing so far today . 
I'm such a sucker for shinsengumi/samurai shows :) Especially when the new weapons < PROPFEMALE > is part of the conflict . It's depressing , but I have to admire the spirit . 
ninja sigh .... I need to get up and run around or something , way too much energy right now for how late at night it is 
was going to get into the info tab and fill it up with a bit of information but I think I'll just procrastinate that for a while longer 
<(''<) < (' ' ) > (>'')> Dance < PROPFIRST > Dance ! 
You know it's going to be one of those days when you look down and realize that you've been happily pouring your orange juice into your cereal lol 
My day and I will do better tomorrow 
Screaming into a pillow isn't as satisfying as people make it out to be . Not that I've done it in a couple of years , I was just thinking that maybe I should , but then remembered that . Then thought to post it just as some kind of babble :) I hope you enjoyed this session of button pushing fun ... (( buttons ... keyboard ... get it ? )) 
Thought of the moment : I ** NEED ** an oni mask 
* Thinking back on yesterday * Grrr . Why do I suck at sparring so bad ! 
Off to get some coffee and I guess hit up Walmart ? 
It's all over now ... they're building a < PROPFEMALE>'s practically right acrossed the street from me ! 
Question , does anyone know the most effective way to get rid of a pinched nerve ... without pills preferably . I've had this one in the back of my shoulder since Tuesday and starting yesterday I've had to start taking aspirin along with using bengay . I'll take any tips , hints , or tricks since this is just driving me crazy lol . Remember , no pills ! So please don't bother offering :) 
So I'm making this table , and it's requiring entering an excessively long equation into a single cell in excel ... which wouldn't be too much of a problem since I actually really like excel because you have so much range in it . Except I keep losing my place while entering it * grumble * :( 
If only there was a place to go swimming ... and no , not the ocean :( 
The phrase I used the most today was : O.D. on orange juice ; how about y'all ? :P 
Tonight was a really good night :) 
Ended up sleeping in till 9 so I ended up missing class :( But I ended up planting some < PROPFEMALE > fly traps and we picked up a bearded dragon and a pac man frog :) 
Now if only I could find some pants my renaissance festival costume would be complete :D 
Finally the internet's back up ! Too bad I have to head to work in a couple so I don't really get to enjoy it :( 
So tired ! I even just downed another 1/2 of a 5 hr energy just to stay up and running 
Hot tea is my friend :P 
* sigh * my poor dead < PROPFEMALE > 
on the plus side , walking's good for me :P 
Pinellas County Fair tonight , it's been forever since I've gone !
