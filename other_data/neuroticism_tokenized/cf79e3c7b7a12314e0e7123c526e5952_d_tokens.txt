We stole the Eagle from the Air Force , The Anchor from the Navy , The Rope from the Army , And on the seveth day when God resed , We overran his perimeter and stole the Globe , And have bin running the show ever since .... Marine Corp-Freak Nasty-7/11/11 
If you don't like something change it ; if you can't change it , change the way you think about it . 
There are only two kinds of people that understand Marines : Marines and the enemy . Everyone else has a second-hand opinion . 
I come in peace , I didn't bring artillery . But I am pleading with you with tears in my eyes : If you fuck with me , I'll end you . 
Im going to see around the world i have the cleanest body , the filthiest mind , the highest morale , and the lowest morals of any group of animals you will ever see . Thank God im an ass hole ... United States < PROPFEMALE > Corp-Freak Nasty- 
Road to s < PROPFEMALE > te baby .. time < PROPFEMALE > go in or go home ... my team is on point we got diss 
Criticism may not be agreeable , but it is necessary . It fulfils the same function as pain in the human body . It calls attention to an unhealthy state of things .... 
Some people spend an entire lifetime wondering if they made a difference in the world . But , the Marines don't have that problem . \ 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > , President of the United States 
Marines I see as two breeds , Pit Bulls or Great Danes , because Marines come in two varieties , big and mean , or skinny and mean . They're aggressive on the attack and tenacious on defense . They've got really short hair and they always go for the throat . 
One mans last minute is another mans Crunch Time .... A procastinator aint nothin but a dude who works n da moment whn it counts all or nothin ... 
The < PROPFEMALE > of the man is for the woman , but the < PROPFEMALE > of the woman is for the < PROPFEMALE > of the man 
Where the heart lies , let the brain lie also . 
She's grow'n on me ...
