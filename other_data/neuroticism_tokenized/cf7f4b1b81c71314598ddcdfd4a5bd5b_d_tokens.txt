Can't believe that her Nephew Nate is One today ! Last year about this time in the day I was driving my sister to the hospital , while she said through clenched teeth , from the back seat of her own car \PLEASE STOP TALKING\ " . :) Ahh .. memories ! " 
My heart goes out to the Harrigan-O'Shaughnessy Family who is greiving over the loss of a truly remarkable woman , whom everyone knew as Great < PROPFEMALE > or < PROPFEMALE > . We are all better people having had her in our life . May she rest in Peace , surrounded by her loved ones .

Back at work after a beautiful four day weekend , and spending time with my girl Leannie ! Now I am needing a vacation from my vacation . :) 
Still out with the flu . Go Figure . All I want to do is feel gooood . :( 
Having a bad day at work , well , actually , it was a good day until a Director Yelled at me ! Verbal assault for anyone else , but for HR .. it's a daily reality . Ugh , if only I drank right now !

Boo ! Barfy dog @ 2:30 am makes for one unhappy < PROPFIRST > . Now I'm wide awake :( . Maybe this will teach him to eat an entire prescription ( bottle and all ) . Somehow , I think he'll miss the lesson learned . 
Just informed my boss that if I have a stroke because of the stress she puts on me , she has very few minutes to get me to the hospital to inject me with the medicine to reverse < PROPFEMALE > permanent damage . She thought I was kidding . :-/

Only a One day weekend for me , and then on a plane to VA . A week at Corporate should be good ! The best part : Staying at the Ritz . :) Yay Me ! 
At the airport . My guilty pleasure ?? Magazines and the newest < PROPFIRST > Grisham novel . I really should be studying accounting on the plane , but I think Grisham would be upset with me -- we have a history together :-) 
That mother nature , she's a sly old fox , seems big thunderstorms are in DC , and my plane didn't have enough fuel to circle for 25 minutes . So , thus I find myself in beautiful Richmond , VA . 
Some folks spell releif : r-o-l-a-i-d-s , I happen to spell it : P-i-n-o-t N-o-I-r 
Dinner with < PROPFIRST > tonight in < PROPFEMALE > town ! :-) his last night in DC :-( ! 
Buffalo mozzarella and heirloom tomato salad and a crock of french onion soup for dinner tonight . Last night in < PROPFEMALE > .. delicious ! :-) Found two really great employees , and unfortunately had to let a not so great one go . Otherwise pretty successful !!! 
Left VA for AZ . El capitan says , well folks , monsoons in AZ , we'd be in a holding pattern for 45 < PROPFEMALE > . -- that is if we had the fuel to do that ... We don't , so were landing in Albuquerque . We had 2 abort 1 landing , b/c of a wind shear , now , stuck on the ground - bc of a monsoon here too ! 
Ran out if fuel .. Again .. In Albuquerque ... Will someone please plan on storms in the summer ? Uggh 
I want my facebook app back :-( . This mobile crap doesn't work right . 
Hi . It's me . Can I please request the remote to fast forward to Friday ?? 
Okay , I know I'm a nerd to admit this ... But I LOVE < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > , and < PROPFIRST > ! Great show on them on PBS !!! 
So , the only thing that made being at work at 6 this morning to conduct a video-conference interview with Corporate was the ride in : 78 degrees , driving with my top down ( the car , not my shirt ) , Led Zeppelin's Kashmir playing , and my iced coffee from starbucks . HEAVEN ! 
Thank you for my birthday wishes dear ones ! Am at work on my B-day but am taking a few days off next week to be a bum ! This certainly does make me feel loved ! Thanks again !

Dear Paper Delivery Man , \ 
Plz don't find me unappreciative , but driving past my house , backing up , stopping , getting out of your truck 2 walk up 2 me , wearing a hoodie & leather work gloves 2 pick up the paper that you have just thrown under my back tire ( like every day ) & hand it 2 me as I am sitting in my car with my cell phone ready 2 dial 911 , is a nice gesture , but a bit freaky for this SWF @ 4:40 am -Just sayin ' 
Loves it when it's foggy outside in AZ ! 
Dear Santa , \ 
A $200+ vet < PROPMALE > is NOT what I wanted for Christmas . :-/

Almost tab out if gas today on the way to work , had to delay a meeting with an employee at 6:30 who works third shift in order to get gas ! And the most terrible part was that I paid $50.00 for 16 gallons to fill up my little Toyota ?!? 
I read this and liked what I read : To everyone who is calling for stricter gun laws in light of the tragedy in Tucson , may I offer this little tidbit : If guns kill people , then pencils misspell words , cars drive drunk , and spoons make people fat . Remember : Hold the person accountable for their actions , not the means they choose to utilize !!! 
After picking up my new glasses , and a beautiful new pair of gucci sunglasses , I very nearly ran over some crazy old Scottsdale woman who was standing in the street looking for the bus . Lock up your crazy old women city of Scottsdale !!! :-)

Went to the ENT doctor today to check out my itchy ears . He says it's because they're \too clean\ " . Ummm .. okaaay ... then he looked up my nose and said when did you have a broken nose ?
