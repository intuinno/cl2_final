ASO to the woman shaving her pubes in the public shower at the serf . I don't care how comfortable you are with yourself , that is NEVER okay . The showers with curtains are there for a reason .

1 of 3 midterms today is done . 2 to go . Thrilling . 
2 down , 1 to go . And then I'm passing out for a week . 
I'm 3 for 3 on the midterms . So glad this bitch of a day is over !!
