Obama has proposed a 1.4% pay increase for active duty military in 2011 . This is THE LOWEST SINCE 1973 ! Nice to know that during a time of rampant inflation , while war is fought in 2 theatres , our men and women in uniform get A LOWER PAY INCREASE THAN WELFARE RECIPIENTS . Please repost if you support our troops . This is just sooo wrong on so many levels !

return to our hearts . ~ Washington < PROPMALE > HAPPY MOTHERS DAY !

While you SCREAM at your woman , there's a man\ 
wishing he could whisper softly in her ear . While you HUMILIATE , OFFEND\ 
and INSULT her , there's a man flirting with her and reminding her \ 
how wonderful she is . While you HURT your woman , there's a man wishing he\

War is an ugly thing but not the ugliest of things . The decayed and \ 
degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing \ 
is worth war is much worse . The person who has nothing for which he is \ 
willing to fight nothing which is more important than his own personal \ 
safety is a miserable creature and has no < PROPMALE > of being free unless \ 
made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself .

You can know the name of a bird in all the \ 
languages of the world , but when you're finished , you'll know absolutely\

difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something . -\

Every day you may make progress . Every step \
