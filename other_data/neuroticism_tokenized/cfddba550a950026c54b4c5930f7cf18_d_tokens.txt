Yesterday = Happy Birthday , Mom + Happy Birthday , Canada 

is exhausted after her and Thayne spent the day at the Experience Music Project/Science Fiction Hall of Fame , the Seattle < PROPMALE > Museum sculpture park , and the Space Needle . 
hammered a nail into the < PROPFEMALE > Ono piece at the Seattle < PROPMALE > Museum today . 
attended < PROPFEMALE > and Keltin's < PROPFIRST > Lynch Roller Skating Party last night . Then we came home and watched Lost Highway . Lynch advises that you watch his movies as if they are paintings . With this in mind Lost Highway was at times like a dark and disturbing 
sonic youth really rocked last night minus the multitude of people . 
just had an interview with < PROPMALE > Elementary to be a teacher's assistant . * fingers crossed . 
made chicken curry while listening to Ravi Shankar . 
thinks her kung fu instructor is trying to kill her . 
I just finished my first week of teaching PE to Elementary kids . I thought the Kindergardeners would be the easiest but it was like trying to herd around a bunch of hyper cats . 
thinks no one should die because they cannot afford health care , and no one should go broke because they get sick . If you agree , please post this as your status for the rest of the day . 
is disappoint < PROPMALE > to discover that the community < PROPMALE > class she sign < PROPMALE > up for ( Storytelling : the < PROPMALE > of story and song ) is cancell < PROPMALE > due to lack of enrollment . Hopefully the bookbinding class doesn't meet the same fate . 
my bookbinding class is cancelled . go figure . bluh 
Earlier I advanced from an orange sash to a purple at Shaolin Chu'an Fa Kung Fu . Thayne advanced from purple to blue . The review was difficult to say the least . 
because of some miscommunication , last night we had pizza with only green olives as the topping . The day was strange in it's entirety . 
running errands since noon and inflicted with what I believe to be sinusitis ( a sinus infection , but the latin is much more fun to say ) . Now's the time for tangerine < PROPFEMALE > tea and read/nap time with miss < PROPFEMALE > . 
wants to dance haikus . * must take interpretive dance class . * will need a spandex bodysuit . 
learned how to tie a tie . The Pratt Knot . 
writing artist statements ...... ugh 
it was a meteor ! It lit up my neighbour's backyard as I glanced out of the kitchen window late tuesday night . I momentarily feared nuclear war then was confused when I realised that I was still alive .... phew ! space is cool . 
can't stop listening to the white album ... and she's totally okay with that . 
advanced from a purple to blue sash in Shaolin Ch'uan Fa Kung Fu . The review lasted 2 hrs and 40 < PROPFEMALE > . i'm exhausted . 
I decided that it's cool to have a job where I'm pretty much guaranteed at least one hug from some little munchkin everyday . 
Year's end , /all corners /of this floating world , swept . 
grad school applications : 1 down 2 to go 
2 done . 1 left , and I've even been submitting them days before their deadlines ! My days of procrastination are dwindling . 
forgot that pumpernickel usually involves caraway seeds . gross . 
books are more fun than t.v. 
I'm sick of kids . And of yelling . bhlughglubgh .... meh 
State of the Union Address ! I'm gonna watch it ... are you ? 
sometimes frugality means you need to give up loose-leaf teas and go back to the Twinings . 
just got back from seeing Nouvelle Vague at Urban Lounge . French women are so sexy !.... especially when they sing < PROPFIRST > Numan . 
is glad that today is Thayne's birthday . This means we finally get to play the Beatles Rockband . 
is full of snot . 
i was eating paint in my dream . 
it's our one year anniversary ! woot ! and there is nothing like watching Revolutionary Road to make you realise how not awful your marriage is . It's an amazing film and i thought you should know . 
had two cavities filled yesterday : the literal one in the back of her mouth and the figurative one in her life . 
can hear seagulls 
i just got bread in my eye ! next time i cut a slice i'll have to wear the safety goggles . 
spent the day checking out her future school and meeting her future prof & MFA painter-friends . yesterday was full of a hellishly long snowy drive through beautiful CO ( < PROPFEMALE > drove while i worried ) . Skies are blue here and tomorrow we hike . 
yesterday i felt an earthquake so subtle that at first i thought it was only my heart beating . 
i survived the week-long bureaucratic nightmare that was census enumerator training . barely . 
Thanks to all who came to the Mirror Images exhibit opening last night . It was great to see you all ! 
recently i < PROPMALE > out with some kindergarteners . one of them tried to write my name by sounding it out . he spelled \mice . \"" 
i've turned in my whistle and unlaced my sneakers . \ P.E. teacher mikie\ " exists only in memory . huzzah " 
my days are in a state of perpetual weekend .... time for < PROPFEMALE > fork ! 
you know it's time to do the dishes when you start using tupperware lids as plates . 
the neighbours are about to slaughter a pig in their backyard and roast it on a spit ! i can hear it's death squeals 
Do any of you artsy-fartsies know of a good framing shop in Salt Lake that is not too expensive ? 
it ends tonight , thayne's decade-long servitude with the USPS . \ 
such an occasion calls for drunkenness and debauchery in < PROPMALE > Chinaski-sized portions . 
it's time to play everyone's favourite apartment game : find the smell ... 
is off to Yellowstone ! 
there's a damsel fly in my living room 
boxes are unpacked , home is cozy . I can see CSU from my front door . Also the Book Ranch 24 hr . Adult Emporium across the street . Oh , then there's the mmd around the corner . Liquour store is down the street , but don't worry , they deliver . We aren't it Utah anymore . 
If ever you want to talk to me on the phone , I have a new # : 970-568-8774\ 
If ever you want to send me letters or show up on my doorstep , I have a new address : 115 E . Plum St. Fort Collins , CO 80524 
survived week one of grad school ... barely . i'm exhausterd 
the CSU library has an original copy of < PROPFIRST > Alber's Interaction of Color , Yale University Press 1963 , complete with 80 serigraph colour plates ... how lucky ! I get to ogle and peruse until my eyes fall out 
< PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > schm < PROPMALE > y f < PROPMALE > y f < PROPMALE > 
is feeling much less like a walking stress-bomb after withdrawing from one of her too many classes . More time for pushing paint around ! 
Thanks to all who sent the loverly birthday wishes ! My yesterday was great . 
it's a freezing 63 degrees in my studio . \ 
how can one work under these conditions ? ( with a hot cup of tea in one hand , paintbrush in the other ) 
wow , i don't have class all next week ? awesome , but I had no idea ... how do i continue to survive in the midst of this aloofness ? ..... WO , wow , I just saw a fox running across the grass !! 
\Ye shall know the truth 
first day of classes ... and already slightly drunk , thanks to a bit of peer pressure and the lovely Ramskeller -- the only bit of wet on a whole campus of dry . 
just had my first Bookbinding for Artists class last night ! i'm so exciiiaahhted . 
i love being married to the burrito maker !... it means free delicious breakfast all rolled up with guacamole and love . 
did you wake up to the smell of cow poop in the air too today ?
