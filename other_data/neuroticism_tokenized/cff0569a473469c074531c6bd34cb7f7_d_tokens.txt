What makes a quote so deep ? is it one that makes you shiver , make you tear up , does it relate to something that is apart of your life , or is it something that sticks in your head and makes you think for hours or even days about that quote ? --------- How short would your life have to be before you would start living differently today ? 
If you had to experience your life from a third person point of view and had know say or control over what you do , what exactly would you think of yourself ?

Two things you probably did not know about CHIPOTLE . ONE : Chipotle is owned by Mcdonalds . TWO : Chipotle Has a typo on the cups . It say \People we're pleased to know\ " NOW that is a real attention getter but what people overlook is that the corporation is using the wrong form of we're . the apostrophe shouldnt be there . It should be People were pleased to know . " 
Need to finish movin in my room and then work at five . PAY DAY !! Unfortunately , its all going to pay off bills so i have no left over money to do anything . I love being an adult :/ 
100 terms down 75 to go . Word of advice , do not procrastinate . I believe that strongly yet everytime I end up not doing it till the night before it is due . Why don't I just do the work when I am given the assignment ? AM I lazy . Do I forget about it ? Do I just not care ? IDK anything 
finally can get some sleep . still have 25 more terms to do but i am exhausted . Night all

If you and I woke up in jail together ......... using only 4 words .......... what would you say to me ? -- ( Paste this to your status to see what people say ) 
Still recovering from the weekend ... well worth it tho ... What's happening in San < PROPFIRST > ? 
America : the only country where we have homeless without shelter , children going to bed without eating , elderly going without needed meds , and mentally ill without treatment - yet we have a benefit for the people of Haiti on every TV station . 99% of people won't have the guts to copy and repost this 
Making < PROPFEMALE > Cordon Bleu for dinner ... Can't beat that 
Bleh I have been so tired lately I dont know why ... I am sleeping a ton so it doesnt make sense . 
Okay school starts tomorrow ... Was a nice break but now its back to reality ... EMT Semester ... Time for me to crawl back into my cubbyhole and say goodbye to my social life for the next few months ... 
This is my Doppler ganger ... probably didnt say that right but oh well 
Why is there a rhythm for everything in life . Why is there a never-ending supply of questions ? Is there really a reason for everything we do . Where is the supernatural force we all pray to ? Why are the words FATE and < PROPFEMALE > used more than the number of ways to say hello in the world ? Is there really an answer to life and all of the questions it may have ? All i know is that I am blessed to be given the life I have . 
Where is the truth in something that is fictious ? Where is the lie in something that is factual ? 
YEA < PROPMALE > ! 
Looks Like another Sleepless night ... :( 
Well I just spent the last hour trying to rid my laptop of a virus/malware problem ... Problem solved ... Now my brain has too much activity to fall asleep ... gotta love life haha 
Well It's official . I am a computer wiz ... Reformatted my laptop and am now working on improving the internal wireless cards . What a joy !! 
Love is a fire . But whether it is going to warm your heart , or burn down your house , you can never tell . 
The repose of sleep refreshes only the body . It rarely sets the soul at rest . The repose of the night does not belong to us . It is not the possession of our being . Sleep opens within us an inn for phantoms . In the morning we must sweep out the shadows ... 
“Happiness consists of living each day as if it were the first day of your honeymoon and the last day of your vacation” 
I just added lots of pictures from my childhood ... Take a peak and pick out your favorite haha . 
Loving My class today ... Just waiting now to take the last part of my midterm ... Listening to 95.3 Krty and on Facebook . Haha after this I got to go to work so bleh ahah . How's everyone else's day going ? 
Whose idea was it for me to take night classes ? Horrible , horrible idea . I am exhausted . 
Why does this have to be So Confusing !? Can it never just be straightforward ? People say to fight for what you want , what you believe in , or what you stand for ... But what is the point of not giving up if you already know the Outcome of the situation ? Hope is beginning to slip out the back door . Will there ever be that one ? 
How about this . 2 in the morning , Dead tired but not sleepy AT ALL . Fml lol 
Anyone who comes to this site with drama needs to return to Myspace 
work tonight and then home ... Pretty basic day 
Happy Easter everyone , but especiaally to you . I really appreciate everything you have done for me .

Damn . Giants lose once again ... Why on earth would you put < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > in a game that has already been lost instead of the last 3 games that have been extremely close ? WTF 
Well Shoot . Can't watch the Sharks kick some < PROPMALE > ass tonight due to the smartness of choosing night classes . bleh ! won't make that mistake again ! Anybody have a website I can watch the game for free ? 
Our Father , who < PROPMALE > in The Tank , Hockey be thy name . Thy will be done , the Cup will be won , on ice as well as in the stands . Give us this day our hockey sticks , and forgive us of our penalties , as we forgive those who cross-check against us . Lead us not into elimination , but deliver us our victory . In the name of the ... fans , Lord < PROPMALE > , and the Sharks . Amen LET'S GO SHARKS ! 
Wow . Well that's good to know at least . At least there is no more guessing . 
Need Help ... Good English Teacher over at West Valley ? 
Listening to Krty last night ... heater on full blast and still managed to get the chills when i listened to this song . The song is from Rascal Flatts from ' 04 . How it's been 6 years and never heard of this song , I dunno .

One last final tomorrow night and then heading to A . j . ' s Goin Away Rage at the beach tomorrow night . 
I can not , at any age , be content to take my place by the bleachers and simply look on . Life was meant to be lived . Curiosity must \ 
be kept alive . One must never , for whatever reason , turn his back on \ 
life . 
Already had an A in the class so I didn't hve to take the final ! What a waste of gas ... Oh well semester done ! 
Went to A . j's goin away bonfire and somehow picked up a half dozen ticks ... Could be more but death count is at six right now haha

New rims and tires , lowering springs , Performance Tuner and Under-drive pully on the way ... What do you think ? 
What a sweet deal . I am livin the life . Anybody wanna grab some lunch ? 
Let me ask a question , How often have we all wanted or wished that me were healthier , skinnier , or stronger ? To be honest , I say that everyday . Now what if I told you that That I can help you out with that ? No this is not a scam or a fb hack . This is really < PROPMALE > . If you are interested then please get ahold of me . 
What website can i get free ringtones ? Plz help lol 
This is life . Stop Complaining and have fun with what you have . Stop wishing on things you could have and make use of what you have . We all should be grateful for what we have . I know I am ! 
wow wonderful plans fell through ... Thanks 
IS this something worth giving up ... or is what's up unforgiving ? let these quotes sink in for a bit . \ 
“I've\ 
learned that people will forget what you said , people will forget what \ 
you did , but people will never forget how you made them feel . ” \ 
“Life\

that take our breath away”

What is wrong with my internet ? Holy hell this SOOO ANNOYING 
So I took an Ambien at 11 . and somehow am still writing this without a typo . That's some strong medication * ... \ 
* The above statement was Completely Sarcastic . 
Cutting the hair insanely short right now 
The thoughts float around seeking a reason to grasp on to ; The reasons , scrounge for the meaning to survive ; and surviving is the thought of reason . \ 
Not really sure of this , I was just throwing ideas around at 5 in the morning in search of something real and that is what I came up ... any thoughts ? 
Once again . Ambien fails me .... 
Work ! OVeR ! Great DAy ! Now what to do ?

Finished cleaning kitchen . living room now ? 
Miss < PROPMALE > sending me links to trucks ... Still can't find one . 
Mom made cake ... about to go mess that up ! 
Still no letter from < PROPMALE > . :( 
< PROPFEMALE > Black , Just thought you should know you're the reason Facebook is going to crash by Friday . Thanks 
Apparently , some people have this dream that I can eat a bullet ... after it penetrates me in the cheek ... Still feel like superman ! 
Honestly , We know friday is amazing ... and we know the days of the week in order . And for you to get number 21 on itunes is ridiculous , But I must say you've inspired me to make a music video about eggs and bacon ! Thanks 
Yah that was definitely worth picking < PROPFIRST > up , driving 20 mins , and spending my $15 tax return on chipotle 
Who is < PROPFIRST > Putnam ? 
God is toying with me ... I buy $25 worth of lotto tickets and lose ... Find a truck that's really nice ... find another one to put me in this damn predicament . I just need to win 20,000 and lit'll be fine . of course , 304 mil wouldn't be too bad either ... would def buy < PROPFIRST > Murphy & < PROPMALE > Harty some sick wheels . and if < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > pays me back i might show him some mercy too . 
Does god have anything to do with the selection of the lotto < PROPFIRST > ? I know they say have faith , and I have it , and I realize there are other's who are more deserving of the money but It'd make so many problems disappear for some many of those close to me . God , if you're reading this by any < PROPMALE > , My number's are 5 ... 8 ... 21 ..... forgot the rest lol 
iPhone 4 !!!!! Words with friends , Bry-Guy-No-Lie . I'm waiting ! 
Time to outfit the IPhone with music , anybody mind me bumming off their music ? I would really appreciate it 
This J.B. for the iphone is not working out ... any help out there ? 
And the split shift begins
