is on vacation for 10 days !!!! 

I'm so sick and tired of people trying to create drama when there really is no need for it . But i guess that is just the way it goes when you work with a bunch of imature people that don't seem to have anything better to do with there time . As for me from now on I'm just going to work and gonna do the best job that I can and stay out of it all . I'm not there to be anyones friend . 
Had a very busy day and tomorrow is looking like it may be just as busy ... 
Thank you everyone for your Birthday wishes , for those of you that didn't wish me a happy birthday that's ok there is always next year ;) 
Stuff is so messed up right now ..... not sure what I'm gonna do ! 
can't wait till tomorrow it's my friday !! 
I try so hard to make others happy , I think I'm gonna try to make myself happy .... Does that make me a selfish person ? 
sitting here getting my tat done . its gonna be a long day ! 
Hope < PROPFIRST>'s tests turn out alright . Doc says he has a good strong ticker ! Just hope the brain scan turns out good too ! 
Happy Birthday to my baby boy T.J. !!!!!!! 16 years old today ! I feel so old right now ! 
3 day weekend here I come !!! 
How do you love a person\ 
who never got to be , \ 
or try to envision a face \ 
you never got to see ? \ 
How do you mourn the death of one\ 
who never got to live . \ 
Ah ! My little baby , \ 
you lived like anyone ! \ 
Life's a burst of joy and pain . \ 
And then like yours , it's done . \ 
I love you , my little baby , \ 
just as if you'd lived for years . \ 
No more , no less , I think of you , \ 
the Angel of my tears 
Bitch ass neighbor threatened my son and dog with a gun !!! I hope she goes to jail ! 
Sat in the E.R. for 4 hrs last night with a sick kid , and now I have the crap !!! 
making split pea soup ! yummy 
had an awesome night at work ! 
I had an amazingly awesome day at work ... must have been the good oldies music . 
My baby turned 12 today ! man i feel so old right now !!! 
I like it on the computer desk 
This week we remember all babies born sleeping or whom we carried but never met , or those we have held , but could not take home , or the ones that came home , but didn't stay . Make this your profile status if you or someone you know has suffered the loss of a baby . The majority won't do it because unlike cancer , baby loss is still a taboo subject . Break the Silence . In memory of all lost angels ! 
Please\ 
put this on your status if you know or love someone who is gay . My wish\ 
for 2010 is that people will understand that being gay is not a disease\ 
nor a choice -people who are gay are not looking for a cure but \ 
ACCEPTANCE and EQUAL RIGHTS !! 93% won't copy and paste this . Will you \ 
...... make it your status for at leas ... t one hour ? ....? Promote LOVE \ 
& Acceptance , not hate ! 
I wont be doing that again ..... Not for awhile at least !!!! 
I lost my phone last night so I need everyones < PROPFIRST > 
I got to see the most wonderful person this morning !!! I love you < PROPFEMALE > you made my day !!! 
What do you want to do before you die ? 
Blah ! 
Cousins are there as childhood friends , and are there when we are older as forever friends .... No one will ever understand your crazy family like your cousins . Repost if you have a cousin or cousins that makes you smile ... Cousins are awesome <3 \ 
\ 
I sent you a smiley ! Want to see it ? http://apps.facebook.com/smileycentral/go.jhtml?partner=ZNzfb008_ZRxdm985YYUS 
took some cold medicine and heading to bed .. I hope i feel better tomorrow . 
Just got home from black friday sales at walmart ... that was soooo much fun we got there at 11:30 last night and just got done !!!! 
Thank you everyone for the birthday wishes !!!! 
change your facebook profile picture to a cartoon character from your childhood\ 
and invite your friends to do the same . Until monday , there should be \ 
no human faces on facebook , but an invasion of memories . ( FORTHE FIGHT \ 
AGAINST CHILD VIOLENCE ! ) 
Not true !!! 
Ok so thats how you wanna be ? delete my comment and dont even reply thats alright just remember who has always been here for you no matter what it was that you needed . well that just closes the book for me thanks I was getting rather bored with the story line anyway . 
Why the fuck do you have to break my heart and then just stomp on it like that ? I dont know how much more i can take ... 
Well this is gonna be fun !!! 
I am so glad to hear that < PROPMALE > is home safe !! It completely broke my heart to talk to < PROPFEMALE > tonight and hear the pain in a loving mothers heart ! I pray that this is the kind of pain that I will never have to experience myself .
