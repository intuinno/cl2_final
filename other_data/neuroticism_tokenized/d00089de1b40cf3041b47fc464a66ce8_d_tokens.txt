Feels pretty darn good ... 
Random advice . Inspired by a conversation with a friend . Materialistic & superficial things . This is what most females are about . They are born from the womb go to the grave thinking , \Well ... as long as I look better than her \"." 
Because you always need a random bald guy in your band

Saw Black Swan . Such a beautiful movie :D . I reccommend . < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > do a wonderful job . 
Just got my schedule for the spring term . Taking English 2 , Apparel and Design I , Business Management 101 , and Computer Information Systems . Luckily , the books I have to buy are less than $30 . I can get one on Amazon used for $2 , and another for $5 . Correct editions , too ! 
Shooting outdoors with a model at around 4:00 pm . Finally . Will soon be able to put up a few pictures of my clothing :D . 
Just got the fabric I ordered today . Mood was behind schedule due to the snow storm ... Which is understandable . Working on a new look all day tommorrow . 
Not a bad semester at all . I got an A in Marketing(Woot woot ) , and a B in Garment Construction . The latter was not the easiest course at all , and us students had a hard-ish time with the teacher for more than half of the course ... But I think she finally saw the light . 
Watching a Japanese [ unsure of genre ] movie called Audition . Wonders if the rules of American horror applies to Japanese films ... Does losing your virginity/or just having sex spell your doom ? Will you ( Probably/most likely ) die ? Lol . 
Totally networking with Agency models . Have shoots almost every week now for the next month ! Yea-uh ! Making connections :D . 
Sometime in February working with Gothic model Mallory :D ... Getting some of my Dark photography printed on t-shirts and then going for a cool graphic print tee look :D ... That is once I stop being broke-a-loca lol .

deadspace 2 
I feel bad for my computer teacher . She had to explain the meaning of the word , \Contiguous\ " . Like really ? Slooow class . " 
Draping on my new form . :D 
Does anyone know where I can download Microsoft Office 2007 , including Word , Access , Excel , etc etc ?... I've tried torrents ... It's for my Computer Info class . Meggh ... I guess i'll try a torrent again and hope I don't get a virus . 
Working with another model this week ... Saturday before work ... Just had some more of my images pressed onto t shirts . Watching The Bloooob . 
While it's very convenient , it's also pretty scary how we can do everything from home ... From our taxes , Fafsas , online banking , etc etc ... Fafsa and Irs are now joining forces so that they can access information interchangably from the documents in order for the user to spend less time typing in information . Same thing with tax software accessing information from the places we've worked at the snap of a finger . 
My Soul To Take ... It's a pretty good movie .
