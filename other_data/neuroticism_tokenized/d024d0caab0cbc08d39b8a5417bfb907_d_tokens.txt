Good job Lions ... finally . As for MTU , well lets just say we have a little work to do and maybe if we could try not to have an obliterating 7-55 game again , that would be awesome ! 
Only in Houghton will it snow this early in October . 
had an awesome time at Lead Lab today . 
takin off from Houghton 
Lions = total disappointment ! Their 2 < PROPMALE > problems = 1 . poor defense and 2 . weak offensive line 
Yay , it's snowing in the U.P. It's about time ! 
Had a good time at Dining Out tonight even despite the fact that i was falsely accused of something i didn't say and had to go to the grog . lol 
What is up with all the pokemon profile pics ?
