I'm still awake after a 2 AM trip to the er with my dad . 
I can't believe < PROPFIRST>'s wreck was 2 years ago today ! I'm spending another 4th of July at the hospital . Woo hoo !

Thank you to everyone for the birthday wishes ! I had a great day & don't want to work tomorrow ! 
So what do you do after you wake up at 4 AM and your water heater has burst ? 
I miss having a boy cat ! This skank won't shut up ! 
< PROPFIRST > & dad are installing the new water heater ! I'm happy & scared of the blow torch ! 
Servpro ripped out all the carpet & crammed 25 fans and dehumidifiers in the house . It's sooo loud & messy we have to stay in a hotel for a few days ! 
I'm watching < PROPFEMALE > with the nerds in my family ! 
I just saw a commercial for gnomeo & < PROPFEMALE > ! How do I not know about this movie ? 
Dad just beat us on wii bowling & danced around the living room ! He cracks me up . 
It sucks that < PROPFIRST > spun off the road but I'm glad he got to come home and play in the snow with me ! 
They've been trying to get < PROPFIRST > out for thirty minutes with no luck . His car just keeps sliding down the hill . If this doesn't work the cops have to close a < PROPFIRST > on 80 to help the tow truck get a better position . 
Ok he's out now but he's facing the wrong way . I'm praying he gets turned around without getting hit or stuck again ! 
< PROPFIRST > just got antiqued in honor of tosh . 0 
The dogs got sprayed by a skunk this morning and now my house stinks ! 
Our house has carpet again ! Yay ! 
We got our first fancy vacuum today !
