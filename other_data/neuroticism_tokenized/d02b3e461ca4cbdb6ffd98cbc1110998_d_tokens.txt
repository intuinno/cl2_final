The Girl you just called fat ? She has been starving herself & has lost over 30lbs . The Boy you just called stupid ? He has a learning disability & studies over 4hrs a night .

Put this as your status if you're AGAINST bullying 
have a personal reason for asking if everyone could please put this as their status for 1 hour . I know the ones who will !! Think of someone you know or love who has had cancer .
