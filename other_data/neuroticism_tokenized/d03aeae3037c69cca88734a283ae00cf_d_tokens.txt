If anyone is actually interested in the reason behind my cryptic posts of late , here goes . I have been experimenting with a beta version of a new social networking site similar to Twitter . This site is known as Twit , and you are limited to four characters per post . So , to sum up , if you put all of my previous posts together from this experiment , they would read as follows : \A bearded goatee wearing gnu 8 my homework . \"" 
Happy birthday to < PROPFIRST > Ely , a man among men , and a generous soul . 
sorry for the language , but this new fb format is f'd . 
there is no linear time . i'm ok with that . but if that's the direction you're going , i'll start a new site . 
back to hippiedom . sick of reality . growing my hair out while i've got it . get me a sports car , already got the trophy wife ! 
if omaha were worth its weight , it would have thought ahead and had a cool backwards spelling like ak-sar-ben , even though that has to be hyphenated so people get it . 
If you have a best friend that will drop everything for you , be there for you thru thick and thin , love you unconditionally even with all your faults and be the first one there to pick you up when you fall ( and give you a much needed dose of reality or swift kick in the ass if necessary ... ) then copy and post ... this to your status . She or he will know who they are ! 
i have been clinically proven to cause more problems than i solve . 
in the grand scheme of things , dirt doesn't taste all that bad . 
don't fret , neck . 
Happy birthday , Mr. < PROPFIRST > White ! 
i find myself bored and picking dead flesh from between my teeth with pointy human remains as a result of this , so called , facebook fodder . good night . 
RE : Today's Weird-Herald Public Pulse : I support < PROPFIRST > Minton's comment and find total disgust & disregard for the naysayers comment in said rag . < PROPFIRST > once rescued me from certain death in Burma , ( now referred to as Myanmar , ) as I was about to plunge into the endless abyss of a Myanmarian/Burman pothole . If it were not for < PROPFIRST > , I would not be alive today . He knows his potholes . Nuff said ! 
this must be the english as a second language class . i noticed y is pronounced e . learn sumpthin ' new every day . 
just in case , i would like to throw in a random \ooops ! \ " for cya . " 
ok ... is it just me , or is text wrapping w/o hyphens ? i love reading challenges , but this one seems mostin-ter-e-s-t-ing . 
i do find it somewhat disturbing that these results are completely out of whack . However , i answered no questions to get this info . supposedly , this application was reading my mind . i think i must send this application to remedial mind reading summer school . 
I am sick and tired of my feeble attempts at frivolity and my frivolous attempts at feebleness . Updates to follow if I can just find a way to stand myself . ( Also , at this point in time , I'd like to thank myself for my own < PROPFEMALE > in this matter . ) 
correction : blue is not the new green . 
i have 5 things to share . but i'm not gonna . 
if it ain't fixed , don't break it ! 
Recently returned from eastern British Columbia in Canada . They have lots of phone booths . Odd . 
i used to tan . now , i just contribute to another glistening facet of the undergound economy . 
my toenails are brazen and unabashed . 
why can't i get arrested ? 
people who are four should not be able to drive ; whether it is a car or a conversation 
and , oh , by the way , none of this could be posted without the independence that people i know and love fight for every day . thank you .

It just occurred to me that shaving cream is somewhat akin to stool softener for my beard . 
Happy Happy Thanksgiving to All ! 
I have decided that I am best represented by a photo of flan . 
Better a late < PROPFEMALE > Christmas to all than no < PROPFEMALE > Christmas at all ! 
OK . The next person who gets really pissed off at the world , take me out and leave the good people who can make a difference alone . For petes sake , kill a seal and leave the humans alone . We are becoming endangered . Oh , wait . Nevermind . 
Pretty much , I am flan . 
Who decided that the term ' tool ' could refer to humans ? Genius !
