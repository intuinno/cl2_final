i miss the important people in my life . 

Holy shit < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ! 
Holy shit < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is dead !!! 
Just got my own place ! I can't wait to move in ! 
Boys hate to seem me go , but Love to watch me leave . 
Moving !!! 
All brain processes .... discontinued ... 
Is keyed up for spring break ! Can't wait to see all my friends coming down from MI to party !!! WOO-HOO !!! I am totally psyched . Anyone know someone who does fake ID's ? 
Sweet and gentle is great , but sometimes you have to break the bed , knock crap off of the walls , and scare the shit out of the neighbors . 
life seems content to bone me ... up the ass ... without lube . Damn it !! 
Watashi no denwa bangou wa roku ichi roku no roku < PROPFEMALE > hachi no hachi san zero < PROPFEMALE > ban desu . Who can translate that ? lol . 
Is bored . 
Vixen in a cock(rooster ) house ? Yup that's me . 
Second day of work today and my feet are like pancakes ! 
This new pic is actually me . lol ! 
Is relaxing . 
“Hn . < PROPMALE > me the serenity to accept the things I cannot kill . Courage to kill the things I cannot accept , and the wisdom to hide the bodies of those who have pissed me off today . \ -Hiei's Prayer " 
Those who knew him would say he hated the world , which was why he was perpetually temperamental . That was in fact not true , Hiei didn’t hate the world ; it was rather nice and filled with comfy trees and window sills . No , what Hiei hated were the people in the world ... 
He was in such a fool mood on this morning for many reasons , but one reason in particular : a squirrel had thought his hair a convenient source of fluff for its nest . The furry creature was now in more pieces than your average puzzle . But it had come too late , for his hair was unevenly cropped a few inches short in the back . -Hiei 
Just got my finger caught in a mousetrap . * sniffle * 
<3 < PROPFEMALE > Christmas and Happy New Year everyone !!!! <3 
Burnt the hell out of my finger today . I think its gonna scar . :( 
“My name is Christmas < PROPFIRST > . I was born on Christmas day . I don’t know who my Daddy is , And Mommy’s gone away . “All I want for Christmas is Someone to take me home . Does anybody want A Christmas < PROPFIRST > of their own ? ” 
Happy New Year !!!!!!! 
I feel like my brain is about to explode ! ' chew the pain away .... ' 
Why is it that only creepy old guys seem interested in me ? 
Haldir + sleepless night + talking invisible cat = Hilarity ! lolz ! http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4482492/1/Kittens_Cant_Speak_Elfish 
HAPPY B-DAY < PROPFEMALE > !!!!! ( tomorrow that is ) :) 
I have my little blue thing back !!! YAY !!!!! 
You're so emotionless , stoic , and intelligent , will you marry me ? 
Wondering why no one ever comments on my status ..... I feel so alone and hurt . You guys suck ! * RASPBERRY * 
Homework , how I loathe thee ... the amount of time you take , the migraines you inspire ... 
F*ing analysis paper !!!!!! 
That was when Light saw it . The thing that confirmed his second greatest fear . ( The first being naked , covered in chocolate , and trapped in a closet with a starving L . ) :) 
Schrodinger's cat ? More like Schrodinger's fox . lol . 
Three papers due next week , about 1200 words apiece . Too much work , WAAAAAAAHHHHHHH !!!!! 
< PROPFIRST > 16:23 “Get behind Me , Satan ! You are an offense to Me , for you are not mindful of the things of God , but the things of men . ” 
Waiting for < PROPMALE > charming to get off his ass and come find me .... 
I wish I didn't have so much homework . 
About ready to choke my mother if she don't leave me alone . Her mouth runs a mile a minute . I <3 her but I can only take so much chatter at one time . 
Just about broke my fingers trying to type this damn SF&F paper ! Itai ... 
My eyeballs are on fire . They feel about ready to explode . Its almost three in the morning . I haven't slept in three days . I've been on a diet of pure sugar for five days , and through all of this I have been looking at a computer screen and typing , and I still have more to do . I don't understand how L does it .

About ready to go @$^%& ! # bonkers !!!! 
When you ask me how I feel , don't be angry if I decide against telling the blatant truth ; Too many expletives . 
Happy April Fool's Day !!! 
Writing papers again ... ( sigh ) 
I feel so out of touch with the world . Trying to keep up with people that don't care . Its like chasing after a dream , an evanescent mist . Intangible . Unable to be held . Like wishing for a life that never was or will ever be mine . 
I hope against hope ... 
I just wanna cry , and scream , and throw things . I'm just so goddamn tired of being alone . 
Finally found something special . <3 
Dôuchébaag Färt Juìce ... My humor is usually much more highbrow , but I haven't slept in a looong time . lulz .

Wondering about passports .... Should I get one ? And if I did , where would I go ? Any suggestions ?

People need to understand that children with special needs don't have an illness , so there is no cure & it's not contagious . They only want what we all want , to be accepted . Most people probably won't copy and paste this . Will you do it and leave it on your status for at least an hour ? It's Special Education week , and ... this is in honor of all the kids who need a little extra help & understanding . 
Will be back in a few minutes . Got to go next door really quick .

Holding on to tomorrow , praying for a future worth living to see . 
Stayed overnight at the studio last night . I slept in a sound booth ~ It was awesome !
