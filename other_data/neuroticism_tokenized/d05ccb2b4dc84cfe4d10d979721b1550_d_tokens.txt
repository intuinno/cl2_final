Who in the Blue Hell are You ? 
September 11th , 2011 . Ten years ago , the Twin Towers fell , the Pentagon burned , and the passengers of Flight 93 valiantly gave their lives to stop plane hijackers . In these past ten years , more has happened to the U.S.A. than I could ever write . I just want everyone to stop for a moment today and think about everything that's happened . It doesn't have to be silence ; you could talk about it with a loved one . Just remember what happened , and never forget . 
~ ? I'm going in for the kill/I'm doing it for a thrill/Oh , I'm hoping you'll understand/And not let go of my hand ? ~ 
I'll stop laughing as soon as it stops being funny ~ 
Can it be Christmas already ? Or at least Thanksgiving ? I need a holiday right about nao ...

I grew up in New York City , since I was born on Broadway , baby ~ ?? ? ?? 
There's a rumor going around that boys are tougher than girls ! Oh please ! Can you < PROPFEMALE > a 8pound baby in your stomach for 9 months and survive hours of labor ? Can you cook , clean , and talk on the phone all the at the same time ? Can you bleed for a week and not die ? Can you walk in 5inch heels ? Can you cry all night then wake up the next day like everything is ok ? Remember guys , women are only helpless till their nail polish dries ! Put this on your wall if your proud to be a WOMAN
