My heart hurtsss . :\\ 

Well , hello Summer ! How nice of you to grace us with your presence , right on time . 
FML ! Worst day all summer . 
This past month finally caught up with me . Sooo exausted ! Epic trip this weekend , then I'm taking it easy , ending my summer binge early . 
Camping Trip taaanked ! Determined get out of Oregon for the weekend , so Seattle it is . 
I . Hate . It . Here . 
If you let me , you wont regret me . Shiiit if you let me , you wont forget me . 
This cheap motel bed killed my back . The closet was better than this . LoL . 
Damn DeeQue Haters . 
Poor Little Tink Tink . 
Finally on our way ! Such a short trip , but I already know it's gonna be worth it . About seven hours to go . [= 
The further from here I go the better I feel . 
Way to try and ruin my \weekend\ " ya fucks . " 
Mhmm , it's official . I live in a cube . 
Just went through the saddest South bridge ever built . LoL . FML 
Cafffffine Highhh 
< PROPFEMALE > Smash ! && Kady Rage ! Comming soon to a town near you !!! Their mindblowing stunts and martial arts skills will wet your panties and harden your cocks ! Be prepared to have the time of your life on potentially the last night of your life . ;; surgeon generals warning : attending the < PROPFEMALE > smash and kady rage show may cause cancer and is not recomended for the elderly pregnant or unrad people ;; 
Shattered glass all over my room . I really couldn't care less . Not even a Lyno moment . Just fucking raging . Congrats bitch , you got under my skin . That's what you were after right ? Then I picked you out with a safety pin and let it bleed all over til I knew you were out . Emo ? Fuck no . Just hating Oregon and wanting out . Now . Not even liking any part of this country right now . Fuck right off . Kthx . [= 
Really doing this . Mhmm . 
So in the past 15 hours I've managed to : Break my toe , Fracture my wrist , Smash glass all over my room , Brake three frames , catch my room on fire , sleep in a < PROPFIRST > In The Box parking lot && Pick up a gimpy dog to take home with me . Story of my life . 
I'm doing this with or without anyones approval . So either support me or fuck right off , I couldn't really care less at this point . [= 
11 days . Thank God . 
That morphine was a bad idea . 
I'm already over this weekend . I just realized how much I need to get done ! Ughhh . Eleven days . So , so , so overwhelming . It's all worth it though . =p 
I know you all too well . I said that we could kiss the past goodbye , but you weren't excited . There's no way to fight it . You can stay but baby here I go . 
Oregon ? Ugh .. 
I'm going to be productive . So much easier said than done today . Hahh 
I'm trusting him with all I've got . I've never done anything like this before , so I hope it all just works out for the best . Fingers crossed . Here goes everything .. 
Fun fact destroyed . Fuck right off herbal essences . 
Thunderstorm ..? =p 
Dear Oregon : Even though you piss me off to the fullest , and I'm constantly talking down on you , about how much you suck .. I'm going to miss you terribly . 
WARNING ! If you are epileptic I suggest you do not come to DeeQue tonight . If you choose to do so anyways , know that there is a high < PROPMALE > of serious seizing . 
Irritated . Story of my life ? Nooope . Oh well . Amazing night regardless . Mhmmmm .... 
Fml . 
Irritated . Kady Rage needs a cigarette and a Camo . I don't have eitherrr . Ugh 
I'm quitting drinking . I'm quiting freaking out . I'm quiting every friendship . I'm quiting my job . I'm quiting this house . I'm quiting being social . I'm quiting emotions . I'm quiting indecsiveness from insecurities . I'm quiting my entire life in Oregon . The only thing I'm taking from here is my < PROPFEMALE > Smash . <3 
I'm watching the dark < PROPFEMALE > , again . Why do I do this to myself .. Everytime .. LoL . Leaving this house tonight instead of the 31st . [= Need my momma , and a clear head . 
I'm finally completely alone . Cuddled up with my fuzzy blanket and still in my pajamas . LoL . I've got my notebook , I've got a pen && A huge cup of water . Turning my phone off now , I should've done this for myself atleast a week ago . 
I finally have a clear head , for the first time in weeks . I've missed this feeling . I'm happy to be alone right now , it's exactly what I needed . Dear Davie Boo && My < PROPFEMALE > Smash : Thanks for supporting me through my breakdowns . I think they're finally over . You two are my everything . That's all I know and all the matters . Oh , and roomie too . Nighty Night . ;p 
Dear Tweaker Bum who threw a burning bible at my new mormon friends : I'm gonna find out where you live , and set your box on fire ! Lmao . Today has been extremely random and awesome so far . I'm looking forward to taking pictures at the playground and then off to work . ;D 
So , I was actually looking forward to work tonight . But now that I'm here , listening to all the rumors of shit being said about me , I remember why I never want to be here anymore . I have only three days left . Can't you all just shut up about me til I'm gone ? Kthx 
Note to self : Pretzels are never a good idea . 
I'm lacking something today .. 
=D 
Chain smoking with my SB , Excited to < PROPFEMALE > out with my PHB's tonight , && My JR on Thursday . Can't wait to live in the dub with my RFL && Missing my NH like crazzzy . 
I'm entirely ready for this amazing day with my dub c boys , my Mr. < PROPMALE > && My < PROPFEMALE > Smash , besides my hurr . Dear Hair Dryer : Fuck right off for dying .

Alone .. Bored .. That's all . 
Nap time ..? ;D

Dear Applegate Bonfires : You can fuck right off . Lmao . 
Me and Jesse : Still in bed , watching Toy Story Two for the third time . Recovering from applegate war zones and suicidal thoughts from the most unmotivating situations . Story of our weekend . Lmao

37-20 ?!?! Duck are going to the nationals !!! OOOOOOOOOOOOO . \ 
So , appearently I've been bringing in a lot more buisness to this station . I just had a sit down about it and have atleast thirty people that come in a week just for my buisness . Time for a raise ayy ? I think so . Hahaha . <3 
Detached . 1 . Separated ; disconnected . 2 . Standing apart from others ; separate . 3 . Marked by an absence of emotional involvement and an aloof , impersonal objectivity . 
Closing , by myself , on my birthday . Fml ? Haha . <3 
People spend a lifetime searching for happiness ; looking for peace . They < PROPMALE > idle dreams , addictions , religions , even other people , hoping to fill the emptiness that plagues them . The irony is the only place they ever needed to search was within . 
I just found this AWESOME orange reflector vest at work . I'm officially sporting it , forever . 
I'm pretty sure my internal organs hate me right now . 
This AWESOME orange reflector vest is a total creeper magnet . I've gotten seven phone < PROPFIRST > , and been asked for my number nine times . It's just so badass though , I can't take it off . (; 
Is not sleeping , anytime soon .

Dead . I'm working on two hours of sleep right now , idk if I've ever been so tired in my liffe . Nine hours until I can sleeeeep . I . Can't . Wait . 
I'm pretty sure I'm shutting down for awhile . I can't handle anything right now . 
Sleeping for eighteen hours a day is somehow exhausting .. 
I just put in my two week notice . Sucess ! I hate this place . 
Lunar Eclipse . <3 
Baking brownies with my loves . (: Movie night , and then bed time .. Again . Haha Hopefully tomorrow is a better day . <3

They say honesty is the best policy , I'm not too sure I agree with that anymore . 
Hahaha oh my , I love my neighbors . <3 
I've been so stressed lately . I'm feeling very confident about today , but I can only say so much to fix this , and then the rest is in God's hands from there . Keeping my faith strong and my prayers with him . <3 
God < PROPMALE > me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change ; courage to change the things I can ; and wisdom to know the difference . 
Being strong is very hard during an emotional breakdown , but someone has to do it . && On the bright side ; I actually stood up today , fifteen whole minutes . Oh my , what an accomplishment Haha 
T-Shirt tiiime ! 
Goodmorning world ! Yes , I just woke upp . Thirty hours . Feeling pretty rested . <3 
I have just been notified that I have no heart . The heart ; Life maintaining organ which pumps and circulates the oxygenated blood through out our body . Hahaha Silly boys , where is your common sense ? Without a heart , I'd be dead already . Now , come up with an insulting statement that's accurate and you might actually get some sympathy for my unthoughtful ways , I wouldn't rely on it though . 
Once again , T-shirt tiiime ! <3
