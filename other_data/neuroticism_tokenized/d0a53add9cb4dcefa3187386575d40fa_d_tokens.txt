Maybe one day I'll write a paper so lovely that my teacher , in ecstasy , will never make me write a paper again . 
I don't think a football is a very good Christmas present . 
< PROPFEMALE > christmas guys ! I'm writing this from my new iPod touch ! \ 
Yay ! 
Haha people think that this is a lot of snow ( said the girl who was born in a Massachusetts snow storm ) 
We was like peas and carrots again ! 
< PROPFIRST > is the best kids show . Next to sesame street , of course . 
Psychiatry doesn't cure bitch . 
This is the box I normally put obscure song lyrics in . 
Woah guys they're talking about putting out a censored version of huck finn . I loathe censorship but this is good timing considering the fact that we need to write an essay on it later . 
Ok guys , I'm working out a plan to deter the zombies . They've already got the birds and the fish and I have a feeling we're next . 
Some of you people use way too many exclamation points . 
Possibly , your father was a homosexual donkey . 
< PROPMALE > Henson/ Swedish chef , you make my life happier . 
< PROPMALE > , you are obviously madly in love with < PROPMALE > . Don't try to deny it ( because if you do , < PROPMALE > won't be on my tv as much and that would make me sad ) . 
Woah . Woah . 3 days from now I'll be 17 . Yay R-Rated movies ! * Rants about the stupid MPAA * 
I know that I know nothing . 
Tomorrow is my birthday . Or the anniversary of the day < PROPMALE > larson died . Ok . 
How perfect was it that the < PROPFIRST > nominations cane out on my birthday ? 
< PROPFIRST > Cohen is my spirit animal . We're both hipster film makers who are forever alone . 
4 of the best picture nominees involve severed or otherwise removed appendages . 
< PROPMALE > is forever alone - http://fakeconvos.com/view.php?id=7605 
I need higher blood pressure ( you think I'm joking ) . 
A certain website that I spend all of my time on that shall not be named could take over a small country and the only conflict we would have is Klaine vs Kurtofsky . In fact , those are the political parties . The 2 main ones . There's also Blaine/socks . They're a 3rd party , but they're gaining momentum ( Friends are very confused ) . 
Spoilers make me paranoid . coughcoughGAPGUYcoughcough . \ 
Sorry I make no sense ( to you guys ) today . 
What is this \superbowl\ " you are talking about ? The only thing I'm excited for tonight is the < PROPMALE > Dapperfest ( or \ " glee\ " is you must ... ) " 
HE KNOWS HIS COFFEE ORDER . ( Don't mind me . ) 
After tonight I will expect a song and dance whenever I walk into a GAP store . 
GAP GUY . UGH . 
KLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINEKLAINE ( Don't mind me ) 
I AM MELTING AND MY LEGS ARE JELLY THIS IS TOO BEAUTIFUL ( fangirling ) 
My party person for the apush role play is freud . Huh . Never heard of him . 
\Taft was the most polite man in Washington . One day he gave up his seat on a streetcar to three women . \"" 
Im at the gap . No guys in uniforms singing ( yet ... ) 
Watson's cute , but I don't want him to win . 
< PROPMALE > Criss and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > singing Don't You Want Me . I'm freaking out . This is going to be amazing . 
Years ago in Greece , there was a Greek philosopher . Just so you all know . 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZdX9irY5fo 
Terrible stuff is happening in Libya , so many people are being killed , and all anyone seems to care about is a famous kid's hair . 
I don't mean to trivialize your lives , but hundreds of people , including infants , have been killed in Libya in the last couple of days . Why haven't I seen a status update about it ? 
Dude it's like Skins ( The good uk version , not the stupid us version ) took over Glee for a night . AWESOME ! Next week they should do a Misfits version . There's a freak storm and they all get superpowers . Oh , and they're in community service . For drinking underage . 
WAIT WAIT < PROPMALE > WHAT WHAT WHAT ARE YOU DOING THOSE ARE THE LIPS OF A GIRL AND A GIRL WHO IS NOT < PROPMALE > WHAT ARE YOU DOING < PROPMALE > NEVER DRINK AGAIN PLZ & THNX 
WOAH WOAH WHAT JUST HAPPENED 
Ok , I'm calmed a bit now . But from the looks of things , SO many fan fictions just came true . 
< PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > WHAT ARE YOU DOING YOU ARE GAY AND YOU ARE GOING ON A DATE WITH SOMEONE WHO IS NOT < PROPMALE > 
I NEVER THOUGHT I WANTED TO HEAR THOSE WORDS COME OUT OF DARREN'S MOUTH . Any screams you hear were my fangirl self . My bad . 
Gettin stuff done at barnes and < PROPMALE > like a person in charge of employees . 
I've been in here for hours . I didn't even realize it . Barnes and < PROPMALE > is like that place in Greek mythology where time passes too fast but you have a glorious time anyway . 
None of the women from the fighter should win the < PROPFIRST > . Their Boston accents are SO BAD . I mean , I love you , < PROPFEMALE > Adams , but please stop talking with that accent . I love you , but no . 
... And < PROPFEMALE > Bonham < PROPMALE > should most definitely win and if she doesn't I'll be sad . 
I hate it when my dad comes in my room in the morning asking about eggs or something and < PROPMALE > Criss is in my bed . 
In case you guys don't know , I'm planning an exceeding eccentric meeting for next saturday . 
Ke$ha's \We R who we R\ " is totally a parody of \ " We R Lightning Scars\ " and the latter is obviously superior . " 
I can now relate the muppets to team starkid to < PROPMALE > potter and glee . 
THE OSCARS ARE TONIGHT SADJFKLSADFDLKS 
Does anyone know the abnormal psychology term for when your Id and superego make you hate yourself ? The one common in people with like OCD and ADHD . I need it for homework . 
I just wrote 5 pages ( not front and back ) on what Freud would say about the great gatsby as of chapter 6 . Wow . 
Freud committed suicide by morphine overdose because 1 ) he had cancer and 2 ) he's Freud . 
OSCARS !! 
WHAT WHAT WHY DID < PROPFEMALE > BONHAM < PROPMALE > NOT WIN UGH . And is this the lady who can't speak with a Boston accent ? Why did she win ? ( Rage ) 
The < PROPFIRST > Brothers did the best auto-tune last night . It was just perfection . 
GUYS THERE IS A GREAT GATSBY 8-BIT GAME ONLINE . \ 
This is so much fun seriously . 
If Pav is the Glee character that dies ( which is likely ) I'm gonna throw my TV against a wall . 
I AM SO ANGRY AT 20th CENTURY FOX . They shut down < PROPFEMALE>'s youtube account . I'm so freaking pissed right now you have no idea . 
At barnes and < PROPMALE > again . Doing work . I love doing work here . I get so productive and psyched . 
\Imagine me complexly . \"" 
Guess who doesn't feel good ? This girl . But guess who's also 10 subscribers away from 500 ? 
Can I just get an MP3 of < PROPMALE > saying \sexified \"?" 
\ ... Those were my sexy faces ... \"" 
< PROPMALE>'s my spirit animal . 
That awkward moment when you have an APUSH assignment on a guy who'd only been to the US one time . 
Celibacy , dig it ! 
The situation in Japan makes me sad , therefore I'm making a vlog about it . 
I have that terrible song \Friday\ " stuck in my head and it will not get out . " 
I just remembered that glee is on tonight . HUZZAH !

I'm still on a Klaine high . It was just totally awesome . Like , super-mega-foxy-awesome-hot . Even better than Red Vines- and what the hell can't THEY do ? 
I'm hungry and I want to go out to eat . 
So the only colleges I have any < PROPFEMALE > to go to are all about 50 grand a year . 
Barnes and < PROPMALE > again . Its really hot in here ... 
I hit 500 subscribers on YouTube . Now I'm watching the Libya stuff on TV . I'm hoping for a quick \rebel\ " victory . " 
My nails are now yellow thanks to < PROPFEMALE > A . Lorincz and my amazing ( bad ) fingernail painting skills . 
There is no fruit for forever alone . 
Today is not a good day . 
I'll probably just do video stuff and homework today . Fun fun . 
My fried is brain and yawn . 
LOL , youtube trolls who don't think ADD is real , calling me a junkie . I gotta laugh at them , otherwise I'd lose all of the little bit of faith I still have in humanity . 
Guys , I'm sorry , but google exposed me to comic sans a few minutes ago , and I'm deathly allergic . So it looks like I'm going to die soon . I love you all . Wait , no I don't , actually I can't stand any of you . You know , since I'm being honest . 
Ok guys , I just watched that Klaine kiss scene again . Turns out , that's the cure to comic sans exposure ! I'm not gonna die after all ! 
I GOT A 90.5 IN CDAD THANK YOU JESUS ! Now this better not be an April Fool's Joke . 
I just made the best video ever . 
I got 4 subscribers today . That was random . 
< PROPMALE > Criss was in my dream last night . He gave me an IOU for an autograph . What is my unconscious mind trying to tell me ? 
Processing my vlog featuring Taby Turenchalk ! 
Faucet water is the water of gods . 
I'm bored . 
Some countries are considering denying people with ADD/ADHD of licenses . This pisses me off so much . And no one seems to be aware that this discrimination exists . Do any of you guys even know what mentalism or ableism is ? ' Cause I face it every freaking day . * rant * 
DC in a couple of days ! Yay ! 
I should have been the hunger games casting director . I could give you a list of people who are good actors who'd actually fit the descriptions in the book . 
Today I have to watch a bunch of youtube videos , make a youtube video , clean my room , do homework , and have friends over . BRING IT ON . 
Grrr no I can't be tired !! I have stuff I have to do ! * yawn *
