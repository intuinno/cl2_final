Man I feel bad for the #42 Target Chevrolet . He had a great race only to be robbed by a bogus speeding penalty . But you gotta feel good for the #14 Old Spice Chervolet , extending his points lead in the race for the < PROPMALE > . Solid Brickyard race though , not 
Couldn't sleep last night , didn't know what to do , good to know 17 different was to make Kraft < PROPMALE > and Cheese . 
< PROPFIRST > Leno is an ass clown that has no right to rip off Conan O'Brien . Leno is like a cockroach in the corner of a dirty house he just wont GO AWAY . Conan's last Tonight show was pretty cool though . Went 0-2 on my S.B. predictions . Now I oficially don't care who wins the S.B. S.B. prediction Colts 38-35 in a barnburner . Sorry < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > , you guys had a nice run though . 
Well , at the possibility of sounding like a nerd , I really think the new season of Survivor is going to be unbelieveable . I absolutely can not wait for the next episode to air . LETS GO < PROPFIRST > and BOSTON < PROPMALE > !!!! 
MAN !!!! I just got done cleaning my appartment , after like 10 hours !! That was certifiably INSANE !!! I am beat like an old threadbare rug . I can assure you that an apartment will never get to that level of disaray ever again . 
To all of my < PROPFEMALE > friends in the world I would like to wish you a very Happy , Healthy and Safe St. < PROPFIRST>'s day .

Life sucks , then you die . 
\I like ah you . \ " \ " I like ah sex . \ " \ " Sex is nice ! \"" 
Up all night finishing my 8 < PROPFEMALE > Psychology paper on depression . Not a wink of sleep at all . Now I am in writing class and I feel like a walking zombie with absolutely zero brain power . Why do I do these things to myself ?????

Well , that was a good win . Way to go Boston , but your work aint done with yet . So far you have won nothing . Nothing but an opportunity to hoist that championship trophy at the end of the season . You still got a long way to go before your journey is done . Good job so far . 
\When I die . I want them to bury me upside down . So the whole world can kiss my ass !!! \"" 
Well , Game 1 of the NBA Finals tonight . Go Celtics ! Unfortunately I will be in class when it starts , hopefully I can get back home in time to catch the second half of it . 
Whatever . 
Got a lot of HW to do . Need some good thoughts headed my way . 
I guess I just don't understand some people . Guess those ones are the idiots in life . The only word I can say about those people is Clueless . 
Ok , so here is a small story . When I got to DMAFB , a friend and I had a difficulty of hanging on to pens over a prolonged period of time . We would always lose em . So , after a few months of frustration on both of our sides , to remedy the situation I bought us 2 $13 ( each ) pens . To be continued ( in comment ) .... 
Ok , so I keep getting this friend request from this jerk named < PROPMALE > Chicken-Wang . I am tired of it . If any of my friends know of this person and has any information regarding this idiot , I would greatly appreciate it if you Inbox-ed me about it . Thanks for your time and kindness to help me find out who this douche is . 
Well , I know my comments might be a little late but I have a reason for it . My WRT 102 class meets on T-T H 4:45 PM- 7:00 PM PST . LeBron's \Decision\ " was on at 6:00 PM PST while I was in class . I recorded the thing on ESPN and successfully avoided the result till I got home and watched it . I just finished it a lil while ago . Absolutly stunning decision by the man . I now will dub the team in Miami \ " The Miami WaBronOsh \"" 
It is official , I am a father to a beautiful baby girl named < PROPFEMALE > Aberlin DeLuca . She is absolutely the most adorable baby I have ever laid eyes on . I am head over heals in love . < PROPMALE > , you are an angel and the most beautiful woman in the world . I love you . :) 
Well everyone , we are finally home from the hospital . We are all doing well . Just woke up from a 4 hour snooze ( that felt fantastic ) . The family is doing well . My heart is completely smitten with my family . I can't imagine how cute my family is . Thank you to everyone for all of your well wishes . 
Got 4 and a half hours total of time today holding my lovely little daughter in my arms . She had a great time sleeping while she was with me . I love her . 
So , my darling daughter was stretched out on my lap earlier today . She had just got done eating and < PROPMALE > gave her to me so < PROPFEMALE > could relax a little . Well < PROPFEMALE > let out a large farting noise and immediately had a smile on her face afterward . It turns out that my lovely daughter pretty much exploded her diaper and peed on my shorts . Ahhh , the joys of parenthood .... 
I don't know who or how old this < PROPFEMALE > Lambert woman is but she does have big boobs , even though I hate country music . 
Wow , this girl sure can put the food away . Second full bottle in two hours ! Sheesh !! Right now she is starting to nod off ( thank god ) . I might be able to head to bed now . Wish me luck ! 
Wow . What a performance by < PROPFIRST > Vick . I am absolutely blown away by the way he completely decimated the Redskins defense . I don't believe something like that will ever happen again , and if it does then the only person to do it would be a one < PROPFIRST > Vick . Unbelievable . 
Two and a Half hours sleep thanks to my beautiful daughter . I love her , but I wish she would just fall asleep . Ah yes , the joys of fatherhood . 
Hangin with the pops , < PROPMALE > , and < PROPFEMALE > went well today . I had a fun time spending some time with the fam . Tomorrow ( or today for some of you ): Thanksgiving . 
Ate 2 Double Grilled Cheese Bacon Burgers and a Medium Criss Cut Fries from < PROPFIRST>'s JR . Currently I feel sick and my stomach hates me . ( Bad Move DeLuca . ) 
NICE !!! 
Watching \9/11 State of Emergency\ " on History International . Very informative and interesting . Watch it if you have the < PROPMALE >." 
You know , I kind of think God wants to keep < PROPFIRST > Favre's consecutive games started streak alive . It looks like the game between the Giants and Vikings might be postponed past Monday night . I guess sometimes it is better to be lucky . 
Well Done Pats ! Gotta love having < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > and Deion Branch on my fantasy football team . Next up : Green Bay ( possibly without < PROPFIRST > Rodgers , we will see about that though ) . 
18 years . Man that was some ride . I will forever remember this day . 
We didn't really need < PROPM < PROPMALE > E > < PROPFIRST > in the first place , however , if by some random < PROPM < PROPMALE > E > we got him , I would not have minded . But , the big deal is that the Yankees did NOT get him . I think one can firmly say that the Red Sox can now be considered the most talented team in the < PROPMALE > East ( at the very least ) and possibly all of baseball . Red Sox World Series camps 2011 ! ( you heard it here first , < PROPFIRST > it down ) 
Persuasive speech for Speech Communication class : DONE ! \ 
Topic : Legalize MariJuana Totally ( crazy huh , especially interesting because I aint a druggie ) 
FML 
By the skin of our teeth ! Got lucky on this one . 
Rough night . < PROPFEMALE > woke up at 4:07 AM MST . She needed a diaper and food . However , she was very squirmy and did not fall back asleep until 5:21 AM MST . She did a lot of crying in that time span , but I finally gave her enough food to get back to sleep . Now it is time for me to hit the sack . ( Please Lord give me at least 2 - 2 and 1/2 hours ) 
IT'S PEANUT BUTTER JELLY TIME !!! 
I Love it , the cool weather has FINALLY arrived here in Tucson . I pray that these temperatures continue for a while . 
I have got to say , I love my < PROPFEMALE > . < PROPFEMALE > was crying up a storm and I was mightily attempting to fix it ( to no avail might I say ) . < PROPMALE > gladly helped out by feeding her and humming while she did it . < PROPFEMALE > slowly got satisfied and fell asleep . Thank you very much sweetheart , you are great ! 
Dear ESPNU College Town , I wish you could exchange coins for campus cash or have the ability to give them away as gifts . I have over 6.4 Million coins and will not be using them very soon . It would be cool to give them to others that would be able to use them right away . That is all . 
Pats . Put your FOOT up fat < PROPMALE>'s rear end and beat the crap out of the Jets . Prediction : Pats 34 , Jets 20 . Go Patriots !!! 
Well , time for bed . < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > decided to have a sleepover at Grandma's house tonight . I GOT THE BED ALL TO MYSELF !!! Time for 8 uninterrupted hours of sleep . Thank you sweetie pie < PROPMALE > ica for your kindness tonight . I LOVE YOU !!! Hugs and kisses to my family . Goodnight all ! 
Man , I was having the game of my life in Scrabble just now . I already had 237 points with only 41 tiles placed . I wasn't able to finish it though , the guy that I was playing left with 55 points . I really wish I could have finished that one . 
2 Reasons why I hate this Super Bowl matchup :\ 
\ 
REASON 1\ 
If < PROPMALE > Rapethisberger wins then he will be compared with < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > Aikmen , < PROPFIRST > Montana , and < PROPFIRST > Bradshaw . He is in no way as good as any of those great quarterbacks . Any person that argues that Big < PROPMALE > is in their league is a < PROPFEMALE > eyed < PROPMALE > Steeler fan . 
Packers Win . 
Top Gear in less than 20 minutes !! \ 
3 Hour season premiere !!! \ 
It WILL be epic . 
Boston < PROPMALE > AND < PROPFIRST > Hantz BACK on Survivor : Redemption Island !!!! \ 
This will be one great season . 
Vodka and Grape Kool Aid . Mmm mmm mmmm . Tasty . 
Damn good Dunk Contest . < PROPFIRST>'s dunk will be very hard to top in future dunk contests . A car , choir and an assist from Barron < PROPMALE > while < PROPFIRST > jumps over the hood of the car while the choir is singing \I believe I can fly . \ " Great dunk . " 
NEWS :\ 
< PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > and I will be heading back east for Easter . April 21 - 25 . We are all looking forward to seeing everybody . Can't wait for Cappaletti at Cassoli Easter !!
