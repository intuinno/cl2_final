still no kittens and the birds are chirping outside .... 4:30 .. i should probably get a little sleep ..... 
ahhh .... and it is report card time .... let's see Tony's ..... he got his lowest grades in Music ( probably because he goofs around ) and gym ( because he goofs around ! ) ..... the gym teacher even said that he should be at an advanced level , but he doesn't listen the first time ... ever !!! 
Finally , < PROPFEMALE > went into real labor ... i guess cats must have a mucus plug they lose a couple days before labor too ... 
two male kitties survived birth ... we named them < PROPMALE > ( AJ ) and < PROPFIRST > andro ( < PROPFIRST > ) . 
has officially started her new eating lifestyle today ... wish me luck ! 
I HAVE a sister who has made me laugh , wiped my tears , hugged me tight , watched me succeed , saw me fail , cheered me on and kept me strong ! I LOVE YOU , < PROPFIRST > !! 
< PROPFIRST>'s game got cancelled , yet AGAIN to rain .... so he came home and rode 13 < PROPMALE > on the exercise bike , did 50 sit ups , 20 push ups , and lifted weights .... I wish I had his ambition anymore .... 
well , off to my job interview , wish me luck !! 
WOO-HOO !! The HR lady said she had another interview this afternoon , and maybe more ... she would get back to me by the end of next week .... about 30 minutes later , she called and offered me the job ! I guess the next guy must have really bombed it .... lucky for me ! 
Hi , ho ... hi , ho .... it's off to work I go .... 
really enjoyed watching < PROPFIRST>'s soccer game . For being the smallest kid out there , he is quite a vital part of the team . He stole the ball a few times , had two assists , and blocked three goals when he was goalie ( missed the 4th attempt ) ... HUGE improvement from last week . I saw A LOT more confidence , and he didn't let the big kids push him around . ( a few are literally twice his size ) ... So proud of my < PROPFIRST > -bear !! 
should probably get some sleep ... but after trying unsuccessfully for 3 hours , it is hard . NOW that the boys are gone and it is quiet !!!! 
doesn't wanna go to work tonight . I could really use a day off ... kinda tired . Got about 4 hours of sleep this morning after work , went to Dorchester Days with the boys and rode some rides , came home and did homework .... now I gotta go to work . I was kinda hoping to get a nap in this evening ..... not gonna happen . :( 
The first person who likes my status , I will have their last name for a week ! Put this as your status & see who's last name you will have for a week !!! 
GGGGGGGGOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLL !!!!!!!!!!!! X 3 for < PROPFIRST > tonight ! < PROPFIRST > scored 3 of the 7 goals for the yellow team ..... :) 
Well < PROPFIRST > didn't quite make a goal .... so close .... he stole the ball and dribbled down the field all the way to the goalie , but the goalie dove on it .... SO CLOSE !!! Next time .... 
< PROPFIRST > told me he has an egg in his head .... so I thought he meant a goose egg * on * his head because he had just bumped it .... no he has a headache ..... 
has got a lot to do this week between micro , chemistry and work .... but no school next week !! 
< PROPFIRST>'s game tonight at 7 ! < PROPFIRST>'s game Thursday at 6 , and < PROPFIRST>'s tournament Saturday .... Who would have ever thought that I would become such a soccer mom ??? 
< PROPFIRST>'s game went well . Yellow team won , 9-0 with < PROPFIRST > scoring 2 . However < PROPFIRST > had at least 3 assists ... he is really developing into a great team member . I AM SO PROUD OF YOU < PROPFIRST > !!! 
chemistry .... ARGH !!! 
is really tired and we've got a big day tomorrow .... < PROPFIRST>'s soccer tournament !! He did awesome against the giant green ogres on Thursday . His team won 2-0 with < PROPFIRST > scoring 1 and getting injured a little toward the end . He took a cleat to the ribs ... he's a little sore , but he'll be ok . I'll post some pics later . 
ok ... so chemistry is almost done , just a final left . micro i have a 3 < PROPFEMALE > paper , 2 discussion boards , 2 regular tests , and a final due by the 16th .... a fun week left . Then 1 week off and fall classes start .... 
Chemistry = DONE !! Woo-hoo !! 
took my next to last lesson plan test in micro ..... aced it !! Woo-hoo .... perhaps there is still the possibility of getting an A .... I can miss 26 more points between 1 lp test , 1 final , disscussion boards and a 3 < PROPFEMALE > paper .... pretty slim odds , but ...... :) 
Proteus vulgaris .... argh ! 
is pissy ..... cyber space ate my homework .... for REAL !! 
is offically on my summer-fall break from school ... about a week . I got a B in chemistry and microbiology I am not sure about yet ... if I lose 6 or less points on my paper and discussion boards , I will get an A .... slim chance .... I guess I'll probably have to settle for an A- ... bugger ! 
so ... I went to talk to my instructor for micro and review my tests .... I now have 10 more points then I did before ! I can miss 16 points on my paper and my discussion boards ... chances are getting a little better .... XX ... fingers crossed ! 
is happy .... I got my A .... :) 
is excited to be starting the fall semester on Monday ... and SUPER excited that < PROPFIRST > got called up for her program to start on Monday , too !! ... and we get to watch Kayliannah in the morning ... today is a GOOD DAY !!

This is interesting , let's give it a try . Most of us have at least 200 ' friends ' on facebook , but when it comes down to needing a friend to talk to , how many will actually be there for you ? I can guarantee not even 15 of your facebook ' friends ' will like this . Like this status if you will be there for me ... set this as your status and see which friends would be there for you . ::

I kicked my brother in an elevator because I think I need serious help . . . 
today is day number 27 ..... but , I only have 8 weeks of clinicals left !! 
This week we remember all babies born sleeping , or whom we've carried but never met , or those we've held but couldn't take home , or the ones that came home but didn't stay . Make this your status if you or someone you know has suffered the loss of a baby ...
