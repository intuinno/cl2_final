It's funny , how bad this hurt , and now ... How little it does . Honestly , I hope you think of me when he fucks you :) and btw , I DON'T cheat , but whatever helps you justify it in your mind I guess . Oh and < PROPFIRST > , When she cheats on you with < PROPMALE > , heh , Have fun with that XD < PROPFEMALE > given you everything , but you decided to be a child , now I'm done . 
When icecream melts , do you put it back in the freezer , or drink that shit ? Think about it . 
Searching frantically for two dollars >> 
is lost in the hollow abyss that leaves you shaking and cold amidst the flames of the wreckage . Blind , Hands shaking and tears refusing to fall in the wake of the glass shard ashes . Insomnia never seemed so great , after waking to the dreams where you're here ... 
is Rocking out to TSC boredly at 2:00 Am ... Insomnia is my only friend these days >> 
So bored it hurts . 
= Fool . 
What happens when you combine A Stoner with a Druggie , A Classic Romantic with a Fucking Bitch , A Nympho with a Virgin , A Lover with a Fiighter , A Optimist with a Logicaly inept coward , A Risk Junkie with a Pacifist , or a World Of Oppertunity , with a Man now afraid of < PROPMALE > ? 
This never hurt so bad as it des now that I can feel it . Nothing to hide in , nothing to fight it with . How could you do this to me ? How could you ? 
I'm ussually not this emo , but god damn Relapse never sounded so good as it does this minute . 
1 day left ...

You can't hurt what cannot feel . Yet we still try . Think about it ? 
Icecream . 
Rest In Peace , < PROPFIRST > Busch . I'll never forget . 
With the stars just out of reach , I can smell the flavor of your touch , as the raindrops glide from the skies below , I am reminded of the empty tears you faked . 
Happy Easter . That's what I'm supposed to say right ? Broccoli .

\Every poison kiss that you blew I deflected with an icy cold stare that I learned from you What's a boy to do ? \"" 
Migrane . 
Going to be a long day . I can deal though , last night was one of the most amazing night's in a long time . Makes up for anything that happens today :) 
Working on my biggest and most amazing tattoo idea I have ever had . That , n Mr Nice Guy is fucking amazing , for those of you who know me , you can imagine what MNG is [ insertmusedsmirkhere ] 
These ideas are nightmares to white parents/ Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings/ Like whatever they say has no bearing , it's so scary in a house that allows/ no swearing/ To see him walking around with his headphones blaring/ Alone in his own zone , cold and he don't care/ He's a problem child/ And what bothers him all comes out , when he talks about/ His fuckin ' dad walkin ' out ... 
Concert < PROPFEMALE > Night ! 
Them demons had \Absolute Power\ " when I drug abused\ 
How many ways do I have to fight till you're Just Mine ? \ 
The words ring deep and hearts not meant to keep\ 
Stinging with the asprin lit feeling , stolen from the blindness of faith\ 
Faith , Faith , Faith , Faithfull like a memory\ 
Ever fading at a needles tip\ 
Was I ever so tangelble as I am now\ 
Stolen away in miserys embracing hook\ 
Yeah ... I'll bleed for you . One last time . 
This , that , and a million excuses , No reasons . 
A broken dream is nothing more than a memory that never happend and the hole it leaves is only as deep as you found it . 
Every time I turn around , It's you again . I thought Id puke , but it's my composer that makes you sweat . Truth is , I fucking Hate you , It's good to know your still alive , I hope you die . 
\Bitch 
is a big fan of , You take something of mine from me , I take Everything from you , then maybe you will think twice about STEALING from me . 
Tornados in a thicket of < PROPFEMALE > pedals . How the < PROPFEMALE > plays his tune , oh dance to the tune of his sarcastic circle . Save me , theyre all happy . 
Sippin Coffee is for Women and Children , I'ma full blown Addict , Mainline that shit like youd never see her again . Ash , Next Sunday . 8
