< PROPMALE > of pop : dead at 50 . play your favorite < PROPFIRST > diddies in rememberance , putting \The Love You Save\ " at the top of your lists . R.I.P. " 
no my first name ain't baby , it's < PROPFEMALE > , miss < PROPMALE > if you're nasty . 
i don't need spam-mail to tell me that impotence is not a good thing

fina-frickinly , a phone to call my own . on the cheap too , lol . 
why does it seem that all the nutters are born around the same time frame June-July ( me , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , and the rest of you summer whores ) u know who u are ... btw , happy 80th b-day < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > , lol . 
maybe if you've used twitter in the past , then you would have twattered or twatted ? ( ex : oh , yesterday i twatted on twitter . you should have seen it ! ) . let's get the ball rolling people . 
been having strange dreams as of late ... with great storylines . need more , need to write . 
woohoo ! have interviews , will travel ! nervous as fzuk . 
today was too fzukin ' hot ! anyone down for north shore side later on dis week ? i'm down for getting eatin ' by sharks right about now ... 
beneath the trees where no one can see , they'll hide and seek as long as they please , cuz thats the way the < PROPMALE > bears have their picnic ! 
this is what you'll get , when you mess with us ! 
for a minute there , i lost myself ... party at < PROPFIRST>'s house , friday . i have a 20 minute set if you want to attend ... playing some radiohead , < PROPFIRST > eat world , etc ... my first show ... 
i've had my fill of wine for the time being ... the smell of old wine bottles make me feel sick ... 
just wrote a song about meat eaters last night . idk , i'm becoming more embroiled over people eating meat which is somewhat usually fine by me but i find myself becoming more uncomfortable at a table with meat on it , lol . inspired by ' meat is murder ' by the smiths this is called ' piggy underneath ' . 
do NOT trust companies people . the main purpose of a business IS to make a profit . why do people give these organisations so much credit . the free market is imperfect and we need regulations to control negative externalities . the public option will do just that . otherwise we will have companies dumping toxic waste into rivers simply because it is more cost effective in a free market . 
going to have a short doozer before party tonight ... goodnight < PROPFEMALE > ! 
the dvd menu music gets irritating after the 10th play ... 
sing me a lullaby ... 
wrote my first song on the piano last night . i don't like how the music sometimes takes on a life of its own and reveals too much about one's self . guess that's the whole purpose , eh ? 
New Blog Posted : [ Backyard Nation Building : And The South Shall Rise Again ! ] http://branechild.wordpress.com 
never again , never again , never again , never again , never again , never again , never again , never again , no , no , NO ! 
why do we even give a platform to people like ahmadinejad and at the U.N. of all places . it's almost like legitimizing his antisemitism by doing so . 
cigarette for lunch anyone ? come along and ride on a fantastic voyage . has anyone heard of these \blu cigs\ " electronic cigarettes ? pretty wicked . pure nicotine . " 
war all the time ... so tired . how long ? how long must we sing this song ? 
i kinda want a beer ... * slap * where's < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > when you need him ? 
how much is a million euros in american money ? 
i'm looking for my hair lotion . ghosts i tell you are stealing my hair products . 
it is kinda scary the type of information you can find on a person if you know the right google clicks . i seriously recommend discretion when posting information online whether it be a simple resume or signing onto any networking sight . the internet is scary . <----- name of my band ... lol . \The Internet Is Scary \"" 
have you ever had a person on your list of friends who has a lot of friends in common with you and when you ask your other friends who that person is ... nobody knows them at all , lol . how does that work ? obviously they remember you and your friends ... something else rather scary , eh ? who are they ? 50 Euro question . if i ever get euros . 
anyone for a smoke break ? anyone ? yeah ... 
AHH ! facebook just blew up ! 
i have really girly handwriting . is there a pill i can take for that ? 
oh yeah , oh yeah , < PROPFIRST > , oh yeah , < PROPFIRST > number one , uh oh , here we go ! i'ma gonna get you , i got you . i'ma gonna get you , i got you , bye bye , let's go ! 
i have these terrible headaches in the morning ... for some strange reason a cigarette always seem to ease them . i want to stop smoking soon but i think the headaches will prevail . 
if only we could be so murderous ... the world would be a much better place . 
wow , job outlook looks WAY better this january . 
burning of the heart at the moment ... need some medicine ... bleh . 
i dreamt it was the year 2150 and i was a criminal being shipped off to an offworld prison colony . just before the ship was to take off , the rebels came with smoke bombs and weapons . i had a suitcase of fried rice and did not want to part with it because it was being carried in a large suitcase . as a result i did not make it off the ship with the other escapees . hope springs eternal in the human breast . 
love means always having to say you're sorry ... or is the other way around ... 
what exactly would be the difference between christian taekwondo and regular taekwondo . seriously , inquiring minds want to know ... 
if you party like a rockstar ... do rockstars really party that hard . now if you party like a crackhead ... or bipolar sufferer ... that's a party . 
just got back my tax refund from UK . not as much as i thought it would be ... 
I HAVE TO GO TO AUSTRALIA 
ow , rejected 2nd job .

Mayor gets 1st < PROPMALE > or < PROPMALE > -light bottle on the house everyday ( only at main bar ) . you have to check in with bar c/o foursquare.com . often specials at other places while checking in c/o foursquare.com . 
goodbye folks ! sweetness ... 
biggy biggy biggy can't you see , sometimes your words just hypnotize me , and i just love your flashy ways , guess that's why they broke and you're so paid .... 
the shack with no dj = boring night . wouldn't bother driiving into town .... 
my ' puter is freakin ' lagged as a mofo . i will take a meat cleaver to it in a minute . 
the diagnosis is always guillain–barré syndrome . good job dr. house . 
it amazes me that in this advanced day and age we still have no concrete understanding of gravity and what it is . if we believe einstein and heisenberg and they both weren't able to reconcile both quantum mechanics and relativity , someone was wrong , lol . yet accepting these theories lead us down a path of uncertainty ( hehe ... ) . start from scratch i say . any particle physicists in the house ? 
my desktop did not respond well to my request to find new hardware ... it was like , \ahh ! eff u ! i'm old ! \ " then it died . pero mi laptop es muy better even though it is twice the age . for that i salute my laptop for it's years of service and i unsalute my desktop for giving up so soon . " 
woohoo ! i have resurrected my computer FROM THE DEAD ! i am feeling completely omniscient and omnipotent at the moment ! i'm going to go watch Spirited Away now ... 
just finished watching 2012 . wtf , honolulu on FIYAH ! was nuts . plus < PROPFEMALE > head erupting . was awesome . 
full of dread . dread , dread , dread . i'm going away to spain when i get my money saved . gonna start tomorrow . 
craigslist smaigslist . like 80% of craigslist is bullshit anyway . 
you would assume that if you are a part of a political party that you would share the same views . if not , why be part of that party ? sounds fishy to me . power hungry hungry hungry hippos . 
i don't know if i was laying in a pile of oreo cookies but i found an oreo crumb in my hair . i am a bit worried . 
think i'm gonna stay home tonight . been having too much crazy dreams about being murdered violently , lol . someone trying to tell me something ? hmm ... 
i'm gonna call the people who started the internet . i want my money back . 
is this vog or is there a fire somewhere ? 
if you not doing anything tonight , come out to Higher Grounds in wahiawa . I's going be there along with plany people . no weapons , please . 
bleh , too much drink . tonight was fun though . got cut on my thumb but had awesome conversation about space-time and string theory . 
i'm getting too old for this ... 
when you're 98% sober again , it is always amazing to find all the new cuts & bruises . 
happy aussie day ! don't read this until you sober up by next week . 
hip hip huzzah ! 
like me broke your facebook ? 
so my mother says something interesting : the reason why it is so painful for women to give birth is because it makes the mother appreciate the life she has created . 
who wants to eat chimichangas next year ? not me . see , with me , it'll be summer all year long . vote for summer . 
seeing a 10 year old kid with a facebook profile is like seeing a 3 year old walking down a busy street at night . something wrong with that picture . 
i am so stoked that i'm making money to take surveys , lol ! sweet ! 
happy australia day to you late bastards , lol . i would if i could , but i can't , so there . 
there was a bird's nest in my banana tree . i really didn't know what to do with the nest but i needed my bananas ' cuz they were super ripe already ! i moved the nest to another part of the tree , but i think that the mama bird isn't going to come back anymore . and plus there is a baby bird already hatched in the nest . 
... makes me wonder if i should take up coffee again ... 
iPad . i thought it was a bostonian version of iPod . 
From < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Guba : [ My Daughter Selah ( age 5 ) ran in to traffic on the way to the school bus stop . She was hit by a car , and helicoptered to a hospital 1.5 hours away . She's in a coma , and has brain damage . She's had brain surgery , and can't breathe on her own . We find out tonight or tomorrow if she'll live . PRAY for us . We don't need money , or stuff-we need a healing touch from GOD . ] 
\God gave men brains larger than dogs so that they wouldn't hump women's legs at cocktail parties \"" 
i'm beyond content now with my < PROPFEMALE > :) and a nice movie ... 
knowing my past experiences with creatures of the dark ( scorpions ! ) i decided to proceed with extreme caution . i hit the lights and there it was , a baby frog hopping across the floor . i scanned the room for a container and when none could be found , i unscrewed the cover of the ceiling light and caught the little bugger . i put him out front , in the rain-drenched grass , uncertain of it's future . 
cooking dinner after a few drinks ( a few too much ) . heading out after this because i can't stand being in my current state at home . can't wait until someone picks me up , lol . 
the < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > overhead as brightly as ever . it's brilliance shone like a firecracker in the middle of the night sky . i peered up , wondering if earth felt the warmth of the < PROPFEMALE > as the day feels the warmth of the earth . in a futile attempt , i put my hands up towards the silver shimmering night sky , trying to blot out it's overbearing gaze , but like water through a sieve the light poured through neverending . 
if death is only a physicality and war is a state of mind in constant strife , then besides being dead , life is a constant war ! just existing is a constant war . would seem like we would look forward to death . 
i am a bit worried because i haven't been sick . the last i remember being sick was a year and a half ago in London when i had pneumonia , but since then , nothing . either my immune system kicks ass or something big is going to hit me hard . 
today marks the postponement of white history year and the beginning of black history month . we'll celebrate by recycling lies and making room for < PROPFEMALE > tubman . meanwhile , the everyday revolutionaries will be kept hidden in the library of congress and in the stories of our grandfathers and grandmothers . in the end , we'll < PROPFIRST > him on the back and commiserate , \you've earned it mr. black man ! \"" 
i can't seem to do anything in moderation . living all or nothing . looks like it's going to end badly . i had a horrible dream last night where i was beaten with a 2X4 and a crowbar . the pain of getting hit in the face and in the back seemed excruciating with every twang of the wood across my head . in the dream i had to go to physical therapy where i sat and thought , \how the hell did this happen ? \"" 
i am not very good friends with my mobile . i neglect my phone by losing it all the time . they need to invent a mobile implant to be placed somewhere in between the 1st and 2nd molars . 
wow , whoever first decided to frost cornflakes deserves some kind of reward . 
what a hassle to get a check , denominated in UK pounds , cashed in the US ! 
it is bad when your articles devolve into a pointless inner debate on eugenics . lol . 
i am always amazed at peoples ' ability to lift one another to levels they themselves would never have imagined but also drag each other down the deepest and darkest corridors of existence . if only for that reason , perhaps there is hope in humanity after all . 
holy crap ! eating eat man , wtf . so sad . 
half time could have been more spectacular ... pfft . 
i want to live in the bible days , eat figs , and worship until someone with cooler powers come along ... 
these people are getting divorced for the most silliest of reasons . its not like it is going to be < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > forever . you should know whether or not your partner is a bad cook or bad driver ... 
the thing thats a bit disconcerting for me about these local political campaigns is that they jump onto the social networking bandwagon , hoping to push their agendas , but in reality the politicians themselves have really nothing to do with the social aspect of social networking sites . rather , it is their techie minions quoting them and posting pictures , lol . i can laugh at that , can't i ? 
went to put flowers on my dad's grave yesterday . there was a grave there that had a guy , one year older than me . he got killed in iraq . the thing that really got to me was that his photo was hanging on his flowers . he probably had a full life ahead of him . to be cut down in its prime ... 
if only i could exchange these farmville gifts for cold hard cash ... 
i don't know how my niece connected people buying too much ice cream and the current snow blizzard going on in the mainland ... 
bring it Canada ! 
its my fault for not knowing enough french . 
you know , i did not realise how many actors and musicians were actually canadian . thats pretty awesome . 
ah ! no ! technical difficulties with the lighting ceremony . what a shame , it probably would have been awesome . 
mr. gretzky ! i want you have my baby ! lol . 
stories of drunk germans maybe not a very convincing incentive . 
i feel like i'm cheating when checking the olympic scores online before they actually come out on tv . 
so so so disappointed ... 
ya know , you really think that you can escape some dramas sometimes , but it really does follow you . police and bar-fights notwithstanding it was a pretty good night . i can see both sides of the issue but good thing it did not evolve into an all out street brawl . 
bakit < PROPFEMALE > laging na < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > god ako pero hindi ako makatulog , eh ! isang araw < PROPFEMALE > ... hanggang bukas ... bleh . 
just got through purging myself from the dark depths of the internet . if this is not the last time saying this ... the information about you available on the internet is a bit disturbing . plus , a recent study found that 80% of employers google potential employees . imagine what they may find ( drunken tweets , blogs , etc . ) which may affect their decisions , lol . 
my niece is an amazing child , extraordinary anyway . she would opt to eat a salad rather than anything else . its an awesome start ! 
getting ready to screen Shutter Island with < PROPFIRST > DiCaprio tonight . i've been told that if you're planning on screening you should come at least 1 hour early . your seats are not guarenteed unless you have your press card . i plan on reviewing the film on my blog so stay tuned . 
so i have certainly learned my lesson . next time you are to screen a movie , make sure you show up at least two hours ahead of time , lol . shutter island filled up quick . by the time i made it to the window , it was full ! unfortunately no review for this film this time :( 
the lenten season is upon us . i won't be observing until this sunday though . one last birthday party to get out of the way then its pure devotion . it would also be a good way to get me back onto a purely vegan path . my threshold for irritation will be significantly lowered so don't take it personal , lol . 
i am so chilled like punch right now , someone punch me . i shouldn't get used to it but its almost like i'm alive . 
we have become too complacent and/or indifferent when comes to our social welfare and opening dialogue within our communities . we too often shy away from difficult topics such as race and politics . we think we are too liberal to be outspoken or too liberal to be controversal ? instead of a totalitarian regime censoring us , we are censoring ourselves in the name of political correctness . 
sometimes he has to cut himself off early or else he'll end up in a cycle of wants and needs . maybe he's not that < PROPMALE > up about being < PROPMALE > ry . < PROPMALE > ering for < PROPMALE > er is not ... 
i think my delirium is getting the best of me in this time of fasting . pay no attention to the signs up ahead . 
isn't math and religion great ? i can't seem to stop staring at those bumper stickers \HE > i\ " . i tend to point it out to people even though its the most mundanest of things . " 
if possible , stay off of the roads . probably don't want to panic so you should rest and after tomorrows sirens , expeditiously but calmly gather what you need . essentials : 3 days worth of food & water per person , clothing ( warm clothing ) , medications , toiletries , and important papers . 
hopefully we don't get a < PROPMALE > tsunami . be safe everyone . shoots den ! 
i can't really connect this , but tell me again why everyone seems to need gas ? seriously , i want to know . btw , costco waipio is open early . 
eh , da siren stay broken o ' wat ? i < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > hear um . 
LOL ! did anyone catch that on khon2 news ? ahaha !! the pacific tsunami warning center guy said , \steve langford's mother's a cunt\ " . i couldn't believe it at first but he repeated it ! then they cut him off . wtf ! " 
some lyrics , i have to admit , i haven't a damn clue what the hell they're talking about . listening to < PROPFEMALE>'s tin man i have to laugh because i can't make any freakin ' sense out of it . [ cause never was a reason for the evening or the tropic of sir galahad ?? ] maybe i'm not cultured enough to get the references or maybe its just one big inside joke . if i had to guess , it would be about sex or drugs . 
need someone to put my hair into gangsta cornrows . i just want a job that doesn't require me to cut my hair . 
i am totally infatuated with inspector clouseau ! pink panther films and < PROPFIRST > sellers ... i've never given it a < PROPMALE > before but i've never laughed so hard in a long long time , lol . classic classic stuff . 
took my exam for the census job today . i got 2 wrong but i was pretty surprised . i thought i would get more wrong , lol . thinking about taking it again and trying for a perfect , hehe . i probably don't have enough \oomph\ " to do it again . i was running on 3 hours sleep ! " 
last < PROPMALE > for advanced screening tickets to She's Out of My League . screening is tomorrow March 11 , 2010 . film out in theaters March 12 , 2010 . seats are not guarenteed so show up AT LEAST one hour before 7:00 PM at Dole Cannery Theaters .

ha , i shaved my nasty man beard this morning . i'd gotten used to strokin ' it and now its like that ghost limb thing ( when you lose a limb but it still feels like its there ) . strokin ' pure skin now . <---- that doesn't sound right ... 
forget bi-partisanship you progressive idiots . not really why i voted . grow some balls . if i wanted republican approval i would have voted republican ! wasting time , wasting time ... 
made an appointment with H&R BlockHeads . i can't be bothered trying to figure out this tax stuff . strangely enough , i've never filed taxes in this country , lol . i figure i'd just go ahead and claim as far back as I can . mostly university time anyhow . i wonder if i'll even get anything back . 
checking the mail when the postman comes always seem like it would be fun ... but it never is ... :( 
yes , it was about time they come out with a new free < PROPMALE > sequel ... i need something with no preservatives and no ... uh ... byproducts . 
last night i read an \iCarly\ " book to my nieces before they went to bed . pretty interesting but it already has a tv show . why books ... " 
i just heard an advert on the radio : if you want to secretly report software piracy call this number or go to this website . sounded very big-brother-like ... 
heading out to Soho MMB tonight . i think i deserve a little bit of fun every now and again . i'll be there if you'll be there ! * glug * * glug * * glug * 
i can't remember the last time that i actually had genuine hones t-t o-goodness fun . last night was the sweetest awesomeness in a long time . good music , good friends , great conversations . i also heard some of the craziest shite that had me laughing my ass off , lol . 
i've been infiltrated by the virus ! after all this time of not getting sick , it is a strange relief . on another note , i begin training for the census 2010 job in a week ! woohoo ! work , finally ! 
now i do not believe in the tea party but i do believe we need a more multi-party system . one thing tea party people need to be wary of is the racist and extremist elements that seek to usurp the whole party ideology . if they are successful , the so-called \movement\ " will definitely lose all credibility . " 
how can you not like drinking water ? i don't understand when people say that they don't like to drink water . its like saying that you don't like to breath air . 
it can't all be monkeyisms , can it ? there must be a reason why we have the ability to reason with the world and each other . then again , when we strip away all the technological advances , military machines , and clothes , maybe we're just simple animals after all ... armed only with a sapien-centric point of view . 
seems quite scary saying that you work for the government . ooh , i'm coming to your house ... return your census questionnaires ... O_o i'm quite tired and my head hurts . it is true that if you let a lot of time lapse between employment , it becomes quite difficult to get back into the routine of waking up early . 
how go things in london , eh ? i would imagine something similar to the vog we get here in hawaii sometimes . 
sometimes you think you can prepare yourself mentally for the worst but it never quite works out the way you'd expect . you'll probably never ever ever be prepared . the only thing anyone can possibly hope for is the strength to contain and focus yourself in order to push on through . my piece of unstable molecules . 
first work week finished . i've a three day weekend and i've decided to spend most of it geeking out on hulu . starting ... now . 
i've been contemplating the cultivation of my own homemade tobacco . perhaps a more organic approach will be better for me and it would perhaps be way super cheaper . like hippie meets hobo meets farmer meets dracula .... well , cravings for human blood ... uh , anyway , thing is , where the hell can i get tobacco seeds ??... 
i would suggest that life appears completely overrated but then again , there still are a few simple things i can enjoy without totally destroying my brain cells . i just want someone to wake me up when it's almost finished . 
making my own work hours is harder than i thought . keeping it under 8 hr/day is a task . i made the mistake of setting up post work hour meetings with the different cases . today i finished at 5:00 PM but set up a meeting at 6:00 PM . i had to get all presentable again in that one hour . i also found out that some of my cases did not exist at all so running around was fun ... :/ i be tired but my body won't shut off yet ... 
isn't it crazy how crazy people laugh at other crazy people because they have a different kind of crazy and then stop and think , \wait ... \ " then its not so funny anymore . " 
bleh , still suffering from mild concussion ... but on a positive note , i just got promoted to a office clerical job with U.S. Dept . Commerce Census Bureau ! no more door to door for me . just a chair , a computer , and me ... ahh ... my element ... 
working from home today so i probably shouldn't be on facebook . 
if there is a way to despise people more ... 
keep walking . i don't wanna get shot like tupac . 
cannot be on facebook as much as i'd like . the government is watching , lol . got a letter in the mail about social networking and the sensitive nature of my job . no work talk for me . 
i will say this though , working in the waianae office at night is a bit scary . people up and about at such late hours , coming up to your car window asking for cigarettes ... very worrying . 
wow , is there anything worse than stubbing your little toe on the corner of the couch ? jeezie man . your whole brain shuts down . for a second there i wanted to shoot myself . 
decided not to go island hopping but instead an extended west coast holiday next month . from the look of things , peoples ' best suggestions seem to be l.a. , san < PROPFEMALE > , san < PROPMALE > , and the ultimate extremes of seattle and vancouver . north or south ? 
ca plane pour moi ! 
ok , get this , my transfer over to the extended census operations begin tomorrow ( tonight ) and i'll make the transition from enumerator to office clerk . humbug part is that my hours will be from 1:00 AM to 9:30 AM . say what ? i'm happy that they chose me to transfer over and that i have a job and all , but c'mon . 
* cry * , * sigh * , i may have to cancel my extended holiday :( 
overtime fo ' me ... last minute call . don't mind making extra monies , lol . 
my car is the best car in the entire world . i made the drive from waianae on an ' e ' light ! i forgot my wallet and couldn't make a stop to refill so i just pleaded with my car to take me all the way home . i'm going to treat my car to a professional car wash , lol , for being such a good girl . 
holy crap , can't wait until census is over . let's stop counting people and instead we should make ' soylent green ' and sell it on the black market . i finally get a day off after working nearly 20 days straight . today was the worst so i'm treating myself to some vodka . i'm just a freakin ' office clerk , can't really deal with all this intra-island mess . it ruins my complexion . census = not fun . you people should move . 
i went nuts at waikele this morning . the most fun shopping spree i've been on in a long time . the sales were ridiculous ! some jeans on sales 50% off plus some other wierd discount brought it down to 7 bucks at old navy , hell yeah , lol . after that i decided to raid guess and < PROPFIRST > hilfiger , hehe . 
i went shooting at the gun range at koko head the other day . i'll post my results later . was uber fun though . i got to shoot my friend's . 22 , . 45 , and Gloc 9 . scary stuff but hella fun . 
bad bad monkey ... 
took my mom shopping at guess today . i bought a watch for myself and some other stuff for my mom . when i got home , i realised those bitches over charged me for the watch . i should've known something was up when they looked at me weird when they rang it up as if \did he notice ? \ " . maybe i'm just paranoid . people ... " 
thanks loads for the b-day monkey bash fun everyone ! it was the funnest b-day i've had in years ! and thanks for all the b-day wishes . :) i did raise the glass to the bum leg with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > as a tribute ;) 
mornings are completely overrated ... 
what is a clotpole ?... and i've heard prat ( pratt ? ) before too . i can't be too insulted as they really mean nothing to me ... :/ 
I'm at The Shack Mililani chillin ' with potato skins and < PROPFEMALE > ! 
random drunken texts all around ! after-the-fact apologies . 
if we counted all the lost eye-lashes perhaps we'd be seeing things a little bit more clearly or we can just let them blind us completely . no wishes here . 
i seriously don't remember a GD thing from last night , especially how i got home ... 
just one more smoke tonight before we ends all this bloody smoke . just breathe it all back like medicine and i'll promise . i don't think my voice can take much more . seriously . 
my niece writes better song lyrics than i do , ha ! and she is freestylin ' it . jealous . she made a song about missing me . i should've recorded it somehow . a singer that one will be . 
i'm infected ... with rage ! lol , freakin ' rage infected chimps , but seriously , sick like bubonic . been watching 28 days later on loop . what i would give for a couple shots of < PROPFIRST > right now . 
i must've purchased more capos and tuners than i care to mention . where the fuck are they ?! is there a mysterious void that sucks up miscellaneous items ? it is very frustrating when you want to do something and something so small and seemingly insignificant stops you dead in your tracks . 
my mom and i had breakfast at 2:00 am . ' t'was fun ! there's no point in stopping things now , like a twisted syncopated riot ! 
women seem to be designed for pain . way more than any man could ever endure . giving birth , life , putting up with thick skulled boys and crooked husbands . there really isn't any reason why we exist other than for procreation ... which is all well and fine but i would understand if more women opted rather for the companionship of the fairer sex . 
everyone loves a new baby . perhaps it is us recognizing how fragile and miraculous our lives really are . funny how people are worked up to such a frenzy . congrats < PROPFIRST > and bri on the new life ! ( little eisley's and your own ) . again , amazing stuff . 
today is a perfect day for beach north shore side ! perhaps later on this week . i wanna BURN in the sun at noon . 
finally went beach today with me mum and sis . got properly cooked in the sun . now instead of crunchy black , i'm a nice barbecue mesquite . almost got attacked by the honus twice but managed to fight them off . dangerous buggers . 
how i miss the mind-numbing thrashing of the circle pit . * sigh * therapy for bozo . bad monkey . 
is mating season over yet ? i think i missed it . 
watching shark week and these people is stupid . they act as if there is some kind of shark revenge on humans . sharks have always been in the ocean , lol . you < PROPMALE > it by swimming with the sharks . i don't think sharks planned , at the global annual shark meeting , to step up the effort . 
ack . finally completed my laundry . to put it into perspective : began at 2:00 PM and finished 12:30 AM . i'm good for another month or so . who seriously folds their clothes ? good habit , not me . WIRE HANGERS !! \ 
\ 
( WIRE)(HANGERS !! )+(laundry)(fumes) = WIRE[(HANGERS !!! )+(1/WIRE)(laundry)(fumes )] 
I'm at First Friday Chinatown 
eating ube-macapuno ice cream , watching oprah , topic : why i'm so fat . 
i've applied for a position with greenpeace . pay seemed fine but it sounds a bit sketchy . i realise that non-profits do hire people but offering a position so openly and on craigslist no less , lol . 
i have glasses now ! * gasp * you don't realise how blurry the world really is until you wear proper glasses . i'd forgotten how clear things were . i'm old now , lol . 
i've just found issue number one of antisocialgeek zine . i thought it would be lost forever . i don't remember that kid who wrote it , lol . the writing seems so foreign . i think i'll run off some copies for the hell of it . does anyone have any copies of my other issues ? 
ik heb een auto , ik heb schulden maar ik heb geen werk ! 
prepping for the big interview monday . i think if i practice too much , i tend to sound rehearsed . i'm much better making it up as the questions are asked ... like a sketch comedy ... preferably kids in the hall ... 
its not so much that i'm worried about modern conservatism and republicanism but when the far-right extremists and fundamentalists usurp mainstream political ideology people tend to go with the flow without even examining how their views actually differ from an ever right shifting party . even so-called liberals are jumping on the bandwagon . all i'm saying is be careful this primary season . 
watching \100 Greatest Hip Hop Songs\ " . really wiggin ' out on all of the stuff that i had forgotten ! fun time before freedom lost ... " 
hope you kiwis are alright after that quake . even that small quake that we had here \shook\ " me up . " 
bleh , of all the times to get sick it is right before i start work . sometimes i think the universe has it out for me . some kind of big cosmic inside joke ... 
wow , mom has pimp ass dreams . she was dreaming about kicking someone's ass because they had her money . woke up angry and swinging and everything , lol . 
bad , bad , bad , BAD internet !... >:( 
yesterday i got a check from a job that i haven't been working at for nearly 3 months now ... :/ decided not to cash it . kinda scared of M.I.B. showing up at my door step . 
man , who knew a security clearance would take this long . second time my start date has been pushed back because my clearance hadn't come through . i don't remember having any criminal records ... 
went ALL the way to work today only to find out that there was badge/card mix-up , couldn't get onto the naval base , and therefore has to \officially\ " start tomorrow . good thing : still got paid for the hour & a half i sat waiting ! :D " 
work is ... interesting . never before worked in a call centre where everyone swore like sailors . and is it me or do navy people seem a bit off their rockers . i was chatting with some navy folk at the subway . one guy was fighting off the pigeons and the other kept looking over his shoulder . 
the ball has been set in motion . if all goes well , hopefully , this time next year i should be working towards my doctorate in economics . kind of intimidated but no guts , no < PROPFEMALE > , eh . truth be told , although i complain a lot about school , it is the one thing that interests me and i think i'm best at . i feel like a perpetual student of the world . 
I'm at University of Hawaii at Manoa 
< PROPFEMALE > Borden took an ax , gave her mother 40 whacks . When she saw what she had done , gave her father 41 . 
I'm at Haleiwa < PROPFIRST>'s 
I'm at Tripler Army Medical Center 
i think i'm ambitious where it counts . if you expect respect from others by being rude and by being a twat , it won't work . unfortunately , all you'll end up being is a rude twat . 
I'm at < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Bar 
reading a short story called \some zombie contingency plans\ " and i think it's true that everyone must've come up with some \ " contingency\ " plan at one point in time on what they would do when the impending zombie attack occurs . " 
I'm at Ninja Sushi 
the short story i've been writing at work has turned out to be not so short . having a bit of writers block and the ending is pissing me off . but , i don't really want to scrap it since i've spent so much time on it , lol . 
cubicles : good escape from co-workers , bad for your mental state . sometimes i feel like i'm in my own crazy cubicle world where an old windows 95 PC is constantly laughing , pushing , and taunting me . 
crazy night at the block party ! tried to keep a straight face but the freakin ' costumes .... lol . pretty sure that naked is NOT a costume . c'mon people ... 
just got back from the polling place and cast my votes via electronic ballot . i'm sorry to say that i don't think it'll do much for the rest of the country . we're all grown up enough to understand that we reap what we sow ... sow no more bitching . 
spent the day with mom , hanging out with dad at the veterans cemetery . they had a whole program going on with the governor , blah , blah , but it was too far to walk to and parking was a bitch . spent a few hours talking to me da . 
a few people have compared my ... demeanor ... to a television character named < PROPMALE > . i have yet to see this show . finally decided to look it up and it turns out that the character is a serial killer . funny how it is suggested that i would like it , but i figure that if i liked this type of show , i would've been watching it by now , lol . hmm ... insult or observation . 
fresh off from work , sitting in the corner , waiting for my order in zippy's and suddenly i am approached by several young men who swear up and down that i was performing at some club tonight . when i deny this and state that i've been at work all night , i get 30+ questions . i would like to meet this doppelganger of mine . 
maybe i'm missing the point , but i found ' get him to the greek ' really depressing . 
i crave freedom like an addict . 
bought one of those portable heaters from walmart . thank the gods for technology ! get toasty . 
Dead Space for iPad ... pretty freakin ' mean . not like those other crap game apps out there . 
unfortunately , the rules of household economics do not apply in the macroeconomy . i keep hearing this . you can't just lock up spending to bring the economic house in order . you'd still need investments in spending such as infrastructure to maintain a healthy economic growth and job creation . even the most conservative of economists understands that . all politik . 
I guess time pays off . moving to permanent schedule starting in april . no more working nights and i finally get friday nights off too , woohoo ! regular 9 to 5 ! now , how can I go from vampire to human again ... 
hunting for new phone and considering ( finally ) on some sort of phone plan . is it just me or do these prices seem ridiculous . I mean , people seem to be paying them most freely so they can't all be crazy ... right ? 
so i went to the garage to check on the nieces playing out front and I spy a naked , junkless doll , with only one shoe on , laying in the corner . at first glance , I'm thinking it is a < PROPMALE > doll , but upon closer inspection , it turned out to be a < PROPFIRST > bieber doll . kinda recognized it and so I call my niece over , waving the doll at her , asking her , \what is this ? \ " she just cracks up laughing . " 
holy crap . so I'm looking over my bloody phone trying to figure out what went wrong . thought it was a broken battery but I took some alcohol wipes and cleaned the area where the charger connects with the phone ( was all grodes ) and connected the charger again . it works ! WTF . still getting a new phone . 
this is battery acid , you slime ! 
holy < PROPFIRST > , full of grace , the lord is with thee . blessed < PROPMALE > thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb , Jesus . holy < PROPFIRST > , mother of God , pray for us sinners , now and at the hour of our death . amen . 
where did all the sweet and sour pork go ? went chinese food hunting for mum but still nothing . and all the small mom & pop Chinese food places , gone , replaced by panda expresses . my brother noticed the same thing about the lack of sweet and sour pork . 
on the topic : Wisconsin assembly passes < PROPMALE > to curb union collective bargaining rights . \why is it so easy for Americans to be conned into things like this ? \ " answer : fear and alcohol . " 
tsunami warning 8.8 japan reach Hawaii 2:59 am 
waiting for the go ahead to evac and head to alternative site . hopefully soon . office is right on the water ... erm ... 
I'm standing outside on my smoke break and the warning sirens go off . all I'm thinking , \the mist ! there's something in the mist ! \"" 
pacific fleet Hawaii reports < PROPFEMALE > harbor half meter surge . no ship or pier damage reported . right outside folks ... 
so so so tiyed . hope goes out to those in japan . did overtime for this bloody tsunami . shift almost done ... going home ... going sleep . g'nite u fakas ... and god bless us , everyone . 
got my room sorted out for st paddies day festivities and debaucheries . not a bad price for being in the heart of waikiki . this means I don't have to drive AND I can grind my face into the pavement the old fashioned way ... fists and horse-pulled carriages . :) 
battle : los < PROPFEMALE > ... nice . part propaganda , part sci-fi invasion love story . couldn't help but wonder if there was some kind of underlying meaning to it all . aliens , LA , mexicans ... 
little asian boy plays ukulele . perusing the various videos of YouTube and thought it funny how some videos state the very obvious . it is either they think you would be surprised that an asian boy is playing the ukulele OR you may not notice that the child is obviously asian . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE>'s dark tower + < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > = good idea ( hopeful ) . hopefully minus viggo mortensen rumored to play gunslinging < PROPMALE > deschain slated for 2013 release . it is said to be a film trilogy AND television series with the series bridging the three films . difficulty rating ?
