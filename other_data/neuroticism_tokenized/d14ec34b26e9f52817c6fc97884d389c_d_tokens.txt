IS < PROPFEMALE > ! You surround yourself with < PROPMALE > and music and are constantly driven to express yourself . You often daydream . You prefer honesty in your relationships and believe strongly in your personal morals . ( Some radomosity foy ya ' ) 
Never play the tuba in a room full of paint . I will make one a bit \dizzy\ " XD " 
just cleaned all weekend , including Sunday . Tired . Well , school and lack of early-morning seminary will be relaxing in comparison . Wish me luck in building spacetime in 5-D . That'll be lots of fun , no kidding . 
I'm officaly out of my mind over that IPC thing . Not like I've been in my mind ever , but I think you get the idea . I'm going in at 7:30 tomorrow to work on it , so I think that gets me one step closer to insane ( or tuba-high ) . 
is obsessed with rolls of yellow paper . She's going to breaking there and burn them . All you IPCers know what she's talking about . She can't wait for the 5-D spacetime to be done and out of her life . Why did we ever think this was possible ???? :P 
DING < PROPFIRST > , THE WITCH IS DEAD ! WE'VE SLAIN THE BEAST ! IT'S DEAD AND BURIED ! THE NIGHTMARE IS OVER ! THE YELLOW PAPER MODEL OF SAPCETIME IN 5-D OF OUT OF OUR LIFES AND UP IN THE HALLWAY ! 
Why am I still thining about 5-D ? I cam up with these whole theories on gravity and the 2-D eye\\ is it possible to persive a dimention higer or lower than ours currantly . It's a strange life I've got goin ' here . Especialy with a certain friend and her certain stare that looks like a certain teacher on a certain drug . Yeah , you know who you are ! 
People shouldn't leave me home alone . I'm belting songs at the top of my lungs . 
YEA ! First full day of school without putting eyeliner on my forehead . :) 
My traditional , end-of-school , evil , master plan is begining to roll on .... :) Anyone in AOHS or AOMS may have half a < PROPMALE > of knowing what it is that I'm talking about .

Okay this is me at 7:30 getting ready to go to school .... \ 
Alright , I'm being sarcastic , but I REALLY AM going to school to paint . I just wish that there'd be another soul there under the age of 21 . 
Ms. Schery got me hooked on Shakespeare . I'm reading The Comedy of Errors . 
I had the best BYD taught by my dad . He talked about dating . It was soooo hillarious and so spirtual . He's good at doing that . :)

Okay RICE people ( brownie points to the people who remember what that stands for ) , we NEED to talk July 30th in THE day . Before then , we need to shindig . Comment the days that you'd like this or not like this . I'll be out of town until Sunday , but I'll check it then . We NEED to do this . I'll call around soon , but if y'all could help I'll LOVE that . 
I want everyone to know that it is official . ( Well , define official . ) I'm at my grandparents ' house in Provo , Utah , which is two blocks away from the house that we're trying to buy , three blocks from the church , a mile from another church , two < PROPMALE > from UVU , and BYU and the MTC are on the other side of town . 
All right , I'm going to start my own section os some of my favorite quotes like I've seen some others do . \

For all of you AOHS people that asked me for my first day at PHS :\ 
1st : government : Mr. Preece looks like Lutz and acts like Lutz plus Blair\ 
3rd : Spanish : Mr. McEvoy seems to like making fun of stupid people 
2nd : Algebra II : Mr. Schildler is so darn funny . \ 
4th : Band : I accidentally signed up for little kid band . Mr. < PROPFIRST > said that he will help me get into Jazz . He said that his room is like church and the practice rooms are like super church . 
To all AOHS peps that complain that many new teaches look like Smithy , I just want to say that I have a seminary teacher that is probably another clone veirson of 12546 of the Moorehead army of Uranus . They're watching us . 
I love Bro . Woodward's seminary . Today's class was amazing . \ 
Godless science is an oxymoron . \ 
Did you know that \seminary\ " literally means \ " a place were seeds grow\ " ? We talked about sequia seeds growing from 1/600 of an ounce to 2700 tons . " 
Provo gets the best sunrises ! Y mountain just lights up all shades of pink and purple . 
Woo hoo ! My aunt and uncle are here . Were going to a play tonight for Sport's birthday . We're watching < PROPMALE > Hawking at the moment . Good times had by all .

I'm gonna say this every other day , but I just got out of the best seminary class ever : the 116 pages lesson . It was so wonderful . 
Me : Like the whole < PROPMALE > comes to that bus stop . \ 
My dad : Yeah , the whole < PROPMALE > , Relief Socity , Pristhood , and everything . They even have that table with flowers with flowers in the middle . 
There come times in this life when all one can do is grab the Nutella and a spoon . \

MMMM .... It's nice to have my computer back . 
I had a dream , last night , that I was in Argenta Park at one of those last-day-of-school picnics and I was talking with my friends and the twins didn't think I could do the monkey bars . I didn't want to wake up and almost missed the bus . \ 
I miss you guys . 
I'm decked out in orange and blue just for you guys ;^) ( I hope no one kills me for wearing Timpveiw colors . lol )

Last one ( #5 ) is just starting . I'll be over soon . \ 
Free at last ! 
In writing my book , I've just compared the main charcater to a winged person , an ET , water , and a witch on the stake . It's an interesting endevor . 
7:10 - I step on a cross between a nail and a tack and get it lodged in my foot ( painlessly ) . \

12:21 - I'm thankful for surface area . 
I hate this feeling that I just epicly failed my homework and yet I'm to tired to fix it . I know what to do , just not right now . ' ; . I
