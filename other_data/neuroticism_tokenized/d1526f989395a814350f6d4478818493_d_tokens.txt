I have a friend who is having a breast reduction and needs to know of a good plastic surgeon . There are some bad ones out there and she is scared of finding one of the bad ones . Anyone know of a reputable MD that does this procedure well ???? 
Thank you everyone for remembering me on my birthday . The most special part for me is that my children always let me know they remember and love me . You can't ask for more than that ! 
Off work today to spend the day with Branson before he leaves to go back home on Sunday . He wants to go to Childrens Museum and to a video store ... Kelly has been gracious enough to invite him over tonight and tomorrow so I can attend Makenzy's BD party .... he would not fare well at a little girl party and his Aunt < PROPFEMALE > might not either ... lol

Ever feel like leaving and not coming back ???? Not a good place to be .... trying to pray and stay focused but this stress I'm under has got to let up ! 
Started my day early with Branson's 9:05 flight out of LR .... then made it in time for church ( only missed about 20 mins ) ... lunch at Mi Pueblo ... paperwork and nap ... or nap and then paperwork :) Not planning to go back out in this heat ! 
Received\ 
a good report from my cardiology workup . Praise God ! Had to go inpatient overnight . They don't know why I keep having the symptoms . Guessing\ 
stress ...... MD says I need to slow down and \talk to someone\ " . I say I\ 
Have another job interview in the morning .... so needing to switch gears . Excited to see what God has for me .... wanting to pursue some other areas for awhile . Need prayer for direction ! 
Hate that I slept through church ! Woke up at 9:16 and was fixin ' to get up and next thing I know it's 10:56 .... and I really wanted to be there too ..... 
I'm so proud of < PROPFEMALE > and how she has pressed in ... and God has blessed her . She got Perfect Attendance for 1st term , Director's Club for 95+ GPA and Student of the Term . Has made A's on both finals ...... awesome !! 
So\ 
excited to see 2 friends and their families ( whom I invited ) come to\ 
Victory this morning . Working on getting a few more there next week ! We\ 
have to help each other and sometimes that begins with finding an\ 
awesome church family . Thank you Pegg Mann for staying on me until I\ 
finally showed up ... 21 yrs . ago :) Best decision of my life !

Great Day .... coffee and conversation with my husband , visited with the girls at < PROPFEMALE>'s , shopping with Makenzy and home to chill . Lil ' < PROPFIRST > is severely cleaning my car in the driveway . He does an awesome job and comes to where the car is ..... can't ask for more than that . Thank you Lord ! Can't wait to get to Victory Church in the morning to praise You and hear some awesome Word ... 
A\ 
Veteran is someone , who at one point in their life , wrote a blank check\ 
payable to the United States of < PROPFEMALE > for an amount up to , and \ 
including , their life . That is beyond honor , and there are way too many \ 
people in this country who no longer remember that fact . Copy and paste \ 
this as your status if you are a Veteran , know a Veteran , or love a \ 
Veteran . 
We need to be \thanks givers\ " daily ! God is an awesome God .... help me Father to be open to all You do in my life and grateful that it is You doing it all . " 
Back from < PROPFEMALE > . Had a great time visiting < PROPFIRST > . Loooong drive , but Makenzy and Branson did fairly well . Let < PROPFEMALE > drive us home . Have 2 more days just to relax before I head back to work . Now on to 2011 ....... new challenges to face and opportunities to grow . Thank you Holy Spirit in advance for your guidance in all things . 
Please continue to pray for < PROPFEMALE > . The shingles persist but she is making it to class . I know our prayers are helping ..... thank you .
