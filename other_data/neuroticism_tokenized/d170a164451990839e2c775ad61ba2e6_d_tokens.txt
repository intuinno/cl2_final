The human life is made up of choices . Yes or no . In or out . Up or down . And then there are the choices that matter . Love or hate . To be a hero or to be a coward . To fight or to give in . To live . Or die . Live or die . That’s the important choice . And it’s not always in our hands . 
Reach , and circle ! Reach , and circle ! Reach , and circle ! Reach , and circle ! 
Make like a tree and get out of here !! 
Bow to your sensei . BOW TO YOUR SENSEI ! 
I hope everyone knows if they EVER need anyone to talk to about anything you can talk to me :) message call text whatever .... just letting y'all know <3
