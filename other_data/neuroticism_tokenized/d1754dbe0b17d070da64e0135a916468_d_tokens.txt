You must become the change you wish to see in the world . If you wanna go far , go together and blanket the cold . If you wanna go fast , go alone , but never back out and fold 

ZOMG ! < PROPFIRST>'s Epic Yarn is the SHEEEEYET ! DONT FUCK WITH IT ! ITS POWUHFUL ! 
OH SNAP ! < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim comes out the same day COD : Black Ops does ! Epic day :D 
Man , i think my body will convert to being totally nocturnal before i get sleep at decent hours _-_ ( yeah , upside down face , live it , like it , or fuck it ) I wonder , can one just live on food for thought ? o.O ,, l ,, 
Every\ 
person has 1000 wishes , a cancer patient only has one : to get better . I\ 
know 97% of you won't post this as your status , but my friends will be \ 
the 3% that do , in honor of someone who died of or is fighting cancer 
uber cloudy skies , good day . Old nostalgia sets in , comforting , but lonesome nonetheless 
Promise me to think of us as a time so beautiful . Promise me to think of us still bright , still colorful . Promise me to look back at us as time in your life , you enjoyed . \ 
\ 
I'll always live in your heart 
You must become the change you wish to see in the world . If you wanna go far , go together , and blanket the cold . You must become the change , you wish to see in the world . If you wanna go fast , go alone but never back out and fold . 
i think im developing appendicitis . I hope i dont , surgery is too risky when waiting on call for a job =( 
Well , Darksiders has an epic glitch which makes the game unbeatable ... lol on me 
Ugh , i cant believe i messed up so badly . Sometimes i just dont know what i think of myself . 
Maybe theres hope for meh afterall . Yeah , hope ftw . \Therein lies continue\ " -Slipknot Therein lies continue ... 10 ... 9 ... 8 ... 7 ... 6 ... 5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 " 
Well , here i go . Hopefully everything goes like i hope it does . Hope i dont mess up . SO MUCH HOPE ! 
Nick :\ 
rating : 7.5 /10\ 
status : employed\ 
mood : awesome\ 
currently : awaiting orientation 
Orientation scheduled tomorrow 8-5 . Im excited , also dreading it lol 
The play was amusing , despite its both random and characterized faults . Gonna see it tomorrow anyway . Ugh , i hope orientation doesnt suck . 8 am certainly does 
Zomg ... having no car in the cold sucks when you have a job . My feet are pretty much snow sponges . To see the play again , hope it's improved , good job NHS kids 
Oh yeah , < PROPMALE > Phntom marathon on TeenNick ? ( plops down , makes food , enjoys ) 
NHS kids and their no school today , too bad i gotta work anyway =P But its ok , Maplestory is finally getting PvP ! BADASS ! Big Bang ftw 
Ha-ha , band practice successful . Only pure music , lolz and boxing took place in the sanctity of Matts house . Impurities have no place in this band ! GAH ! 
Ugh , its the holidays and things just cant go right . Good thing chinese food helps ^^ thanks < PROPMALE > . But after na hour it'll come back in an empty stomach and empty feeling to match . Why cant my ass do anything right ? -.- 
Love is a sensation , caused by a temptation , to feel penetration . A guy sticks his location in a girl's destination , to increase the population for the next generation , did you get my explanation , or do you need a demonstration ? \ 
Most random and dirty rhyme ive ever heard XD 
The ocean is a desert , with its life underground , \ 
And a perfect disguise above . \ 
Under the cities lies , a heart made of ground , \ 
But the humans will give no love . 
so ... why is a lot of people posting poetry as their status now ? I hope its not some lame trend 
random people , go comment on < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE>'s sexy picture 
If i tried to take everything in this world that reminded me of you , itd be so empty . That even God himself would have to start again , and his eyes would roll in the back of his head . And pretend it never happened . 
So green hornet was pretty awesome -though way too much sci fi bs/nonsense- Finally sawz < PROPMALE > and chih after so long . Also disappointed i had no idea A Hero a Fake was in evansville last week ... laaamme =( 
The floods begun , I can't make it stop\ 
I pull myself up from disaster\ 
Greeted by your clear blue sky\ 
I find this city cleansed , I find myself again\ 
The sea is swelling and i feel the rising tides 
How quickly I forget\ 
That this\ 
Is meaningless 
So forum , what do you do when doing the thing you do best , doesn't make you happy anymore ? Leave your answers below 
Happy Lunar New Year all 
So i just read an AOL article saying Activision is AXING/cutting the Guitar Hero franchise . To everyone who ever told me GH is better than Rock Band , ahem : SUCK IT =) Rock Band is CLEARLY ftw 
You can torture a man in several ways :\ 
Filling him with water and dry rice\ 
Drilling a needle through his palm\ 
Dousing him with acid\ 
Slowly slicing off his tongue\ 
Rubbing sand paper over his skin\ 
Shoving bile down his throat\ 
Telling him lies—or better yet—give him intricate riddles . \ 
You can torture a man in several simple or just downright complicated and gruesome ways\ 
However , the one that can make him crazy .. \ 
is you 
Finally , working 2 yobs brings < PROPFIRST > Ballard to actually < PROPFEMALE > out :D
