Watching the first episode of the new doctor who . Every second a piece of my sold dies ... ;-; 
Just finished the first disk of the new Doctor Who . I almost cried ! They ruined the Doctor , the sidekick , the Tardis , the theme song , even the sonic screwdriver is wrong . I usually find little reason to cures the British , but damn you BBC for ruining the best series ever ! >_< 
Just finished watching the first 5 episodes of Soul Eater ... And I was told this was a serious Anime >_< my sides still hurt ;-; 
So , I just found out that they made < PROPMALE>'s Inferno into an animated series . I still can't stop laughing . 
Watching The Lion < PROPMALE > with me mum , it is sad how many lines mum can quote . I must have made her sit through this a hundred times growing up . Thanks for putting up with it mom , and thanks for all the wonderful memories . <3 
Guess who got their license finally ! What now bitches > 3 
Two more finals .... Math and Sociology . Why does it seem that I have found the only two teachers still giving finals this week ? >_< 
Sooo ... Let me get this straight - < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is getting his 8th divorce , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > is possibly getting married for a 9th time , < PROPFEMALE > Spears had a 55 hour marriage . < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > and Tiger Woods are screwing EVERYTHING , yet the idea of same-sex marriage is going to \destroy the institution of marriage\ " ?!? Really ? REALLY ?!? Repost if you agree - Proud to support equal rights for ALL " 
Learned something really important today .... I hate driving in the snow .... and people are crazy . Like 10 people drove around me going 30 because I was going 15-20 in a 25 >_< 
Happy Christmas to all my lovelies ! Hope < PROPFEMALE > brought you everything on your list ^_ ~

Watched the first couple episodes of Code Geass today .... Never thought I would see the day when I would actually enjoy an anime with robots . 
Kiko and I are having way too much fun with henna > 3 Thanks again for the henna Dad and Moo <3 
My < PROPFEMALE > is in the hospital , they found a mass on her lung and they are thinking cancer . I am asking all of you , my friends , to keep her in your prayers . Whether you believe in God , Jesus , Allah , Osiris , Zeus , the sun , a rock , it doesn't matter . I really appreciate it guys , and I will try to update on her status as much as I can . 
I just saw my old 7th grade English teacher Mr. < PROPFIRST > !!! I loved him ^^ Toady is a good day !!! 
Happy Pi day people <3 
I just had a white chocolate magnum ice-cream , which I hadn't had since I left England . Found them at Walmart today , $5 for 3 bars . Ridiculous ? Maybe , totally worth reminiscing and sharing the joy with my mom and sister ? Definitely . Miss you dad and mo <3
