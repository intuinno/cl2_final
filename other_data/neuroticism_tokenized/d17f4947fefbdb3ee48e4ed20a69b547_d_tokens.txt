Happy 2010 to all . Cheers ! 

Having a great/quiet afternoon watching the Tigers and the Yanks . 
Celebrated my son's 7th birthday today , wow do I feel old . But , I'm enjoying my evening , watching a good Yanks/RedSox game and having a MGD . 
Tired of being sick and sick of being tired ! 
Hard to believe its been 20 years since the Berlin Wall came down . Interesting , so much has changed and so much has not . 
Feeling guilty 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas . Remember your families , your friends , your neighbors and your soldiers .

A drink a day keeps the shrink away . 
Republicans don't like Democrats . Democrats don't like Republicans . I don't like any of them . What would the Founding Fathers of our beloved country think of our current political leadership , on both sides ? Look at the physical/educational/financial state of our country . $12.3 trillion in public debt ? Do we not see anything wrong with this ? 
Just got back from Rupp . Not a very good game , but UK beat the Vols solid in the end . 
DRINK IS THE CURSE OF THE LAND . IT MAKES YOU FIGHT WITH YOUR NEIGHBOUR . IT MAKES YOU SHOOT AT YOUR LANDLORD AND IT MAKES YOU MISS HIM . < PROPMALE > would have liked that , I think . Éireann go Bráth . 
How ' bout them CATS , baybee ! 
Just had a minor fender-bender , broke my drivers side mirror . Glad I'm off the next 2 days . 
So , I get home from work @ 11:45 pm to find that the da*n dog is gone - AGAIN . Gate left open by someone younger than 16 . * IF * we get the dog back this time , the chain is the new rule , unless someone is out with her . 1/3 of an acre fenced and the da*n dog has to be chained . I am not a happy Dad , right now . 
What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow ? 
Had a great Dad's day . Spent the day with Cat , < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > . Got to see Dad , Poppy < PROPFIRST > and Poppy Overstreet . 
Was just watching a 50 yr celebration of the Fender Stratocaster on Palladia . Great concert , < PROPFIRST > Gilmour was amazing . 
It's an Eminence Front 
Bowl of Chili and a Cold Leinenkugel's Classic < PROPFEMALE > for lunch ! 
I was just introduced to < PROPFIRST > , my 15 year old daughters ' friend ' . They have classes together at school . He seems like a nice young man . They are going to Waverly tonite . I'm getting old . 
Just got an automated phonecall from Louisville Metrosafe advising me of an increasing number of auto break-ins in my area . Wow , I'm kind of impressed with the attempt at keeping the public informed . Makes me kind of feel like a tax dollar just worked for me , for once ! 
Thank You - Veterans . Thank You , Dad and fellow Vietnam Vets .
