rBST is harmful to cows , forcing them to produce more milk than they can safely do normally . As a result , cows treated with rBST have been found to develop bone weakness and usually die within one or two milking cycles of rBST treatment . 
wants to punch the whole world right in the face ! 
Getting ready to babysit for my friend so I will have 3 kids ....... let the poop fly ! 
is glad that everyone is safe ! 
is discouraged 
is feeling hopeful ! 
It's not only children who grow , parents do too . As much as we watch to see what our children do with their lives , they are watching us to see what we do with ours . I can tell my children to reach for the sun but all I can do is reach for it myself . 
When you are a mother , you are never really alone in your thoughts . A mother always has to think twice , once for herself and once for her children . 
And ten men stand in line\ 
Waitin ' for some personality to be put out on the corner\ 
Today ain't garbage day\ 
Ain't no grabage taken today 
How does it feel to be fallin ' apart\ 
Sinkin ' from the bottom down\ 
It's not so easy holdin ' it up\ 
With everything fallin ' down 
I took it and it was quite a ride . I went completely out of my head and I had a wonderful time , didn’t bother a soul . 
I can see light in the strangest ways , on the darkest nights and the coldest days , I'm amazed\ 
That some how that I can keep smilin , I can hear music in the depths of silence , \ 
I can find peace in the\ 
middle of violence and I can be calm when I should be wild and I can find hope when there is despare and I < PROPMALE>' feel alone when theres nobody there . 
Going to Riverfest tonight 
Gonna have me some fun ........ 
Going to the River Path to get all types of muddy 
Thou shall not pursue profit at the Earth's expense , nor steal from future generations by impoverishing/ poisoning the Earth .

If I could tell your future , I'd say love the world you find . In the dark times and the hard questions , let some sunshine in you mind . 
When I hold you in my arms and I feel my finger on your trigger , I know no one can do me no harm because happiness is a warm gun .

You can tell a woman has children when her purse contains hot wheels and cheerios . 
would like to thank all the friend's that made Halloween special ! 
When we honestly ask ourselves which person(s ) in our lives mean the most to us , we often find that it is those who , instead of giving advice have chosen to share our pain . The friend who can be silent with us in a moment of despair or confusion , who can stay with us in an hour of grief , who can tolerate not knowing , not curing , not healing and face with us the reality of our powerlessness . 
wants to go see Chicago Farmer at < PROPFIRST>'s in Ransom on Friday ! <3 <3 <3
