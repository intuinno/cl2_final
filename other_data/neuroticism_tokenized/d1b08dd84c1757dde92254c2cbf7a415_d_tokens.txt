Life is too short to wake up with regrets . So love the people who treat you right . Pray for the ones who don't . Believe everything happens for a reason . If you get a second < PROPMALE > , grab it with both hands . If it changes your life , let it . Nobody said life would be easy ; they just promised it would be worth it .... Post ... to your wall if you agree ? 

Kids in the back seat cause accidents ; accidents in the back seat cause kids .

I think the hardest part about FB is learning each other all over again . After 20+ years we are not the same as we used to be . Thank god I'm not the same , or life would just be a big party 24/7 . 
Somethings are just better left unsaid , all I need to do is try to keep my mouth quiet

I had a crazy dream last night . It was about my husband . The one I haven't seen or spoke with in 3 years . < PROPFEMALE > had a dream about him too last night , thats weird .... 
The girl you just called fat ? She has been starving herself & has lost over 30 lbs . The boy you called stupid ? He has a learning disability & studies over 4 hrs a night . The girl you just called ugly ? She spends hours putting makeup on hoping people will like her . The boy you just tripped ? He is abused enough at home . There's a lot more to people than you think . Put this as your status if you're against bullying 
So I've been cigerette free for 2.5 weeks Yae !!!
