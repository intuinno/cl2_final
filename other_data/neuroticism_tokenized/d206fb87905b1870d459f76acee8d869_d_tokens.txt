Mmkay , my comp is being sooooo weird ! When I started it , it said a network cable was unplugged o.o So I looked at the back of my comp and it was plugged it ! But I pulled it out and put it back to be sure . And then I looked back at the screen and it still said the same thing , I even went over to my router and did the same thing , came back and said it was still unplugged xD Apparently I'm on the internet now though !

A true friend doesn't care when you're broke , what you weigh , what name brand you wear , if your house is a mess , where you live , about your past or if your family is filled with crazies . They love you for who you are . A true friend can go long periods of time without speaking but never question the friendship . Re-post this if you have at least one true friend 
' like ' this status and I'll do a \to be honest ... \ " for you :D " 
Ugh , boring day for me . Only fun thing I have to do is play with artillery , and that gets pretty boring when you can't see the explosions .

I Believe in Jesus Christ . One facebooker has challenged all believers to put this on their wall ...

If you love God and you are not afraid to show it , repost this

Jeez , no more ghost hunters for me , every sound kept me up xD but what freaked me out was that my vision went white exactly when I heard the wall pop , and then i felt numb after that ( probably because of shock ) but dang that was weird o.o 
Doesn't the Airforce and Navy respond first ? Not the Marines ? Since the Navy usually softens up the enemy with their cannons and missiles , and the Airforce does the same , except with bombs and ATG missiles . 
I .. Got .. POCKY !!! :D

Just got done playing ArmA 2 , I was on a Role Play server and I was driving a car , and I happened to T-Bone a cop's SUV ! It was funny ! My car was only slightly damaged , and while I was driving off , his SUV bounced up in the air a few times until it finally landed and blew up xD That was sooo funny ! 
Flying to Idaho tomorrow ! It's gonna be foggy but it should be better when our Dad lands . 
Just flew up to Idaho , weather wasn't too great , we were getting knocked around by the wind and all the rough air xD I hit my head on the ceiling it was so bad ! And then the wind was blowing us sideways when we were trying to land ! lol ! xD But we got down just fine :) 
lol zork is such a weird game xD 
The zombies ! They're everywhere !!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH !!! 
When there's a crowd of people in your way and you're gonna be late , Mr. Pineapple will save you from the wait ! :D 
Made a < PROPMALE > on Gmod , needs a lot of work though , so I'm going to see what I can do about it xD 
Mech is done and is working just fine ! Yes ! I feel so accomplished ! It's not as pretty as the one from the Battletech series / Mechwarrior games , but it's still pretty awesome 
I'm going to ATTEMPT to beat the 2nd level for the Supreme Commander Forged Alliance campaign again xD 
Bleh , bored and I really don't have anything better to do other than playing < PROPMALE>'s Mod or my other 10000 games . But I'm tired of computer games ! Gah ! 
Went for a flight in an RV 4 :P It was awesome ! xD Except it got really bumpy when we flew over a hill , I smacked my head on the canopy xD It was a good flight though :P 
Is anyone really big on computers ? I need some help on buying a motherboard xD I really don't know what to look for in one . 
Bleh , there's nothing to do really other than talking to my friends 
I miss her voice ! :( Dangit why did I have to be sooo tired today ! 
Practicing emergency landings in my flight sim games , bcause that's all I really have to do right now xD 
I want Crysis 2 ! 
You know you play too many computer games when your fingers are always on the W , A , S and D keys 
Well I made a gameplay video of the original Crysis for the PC :P I'm getting ready to upload it in a few , so if you're interested go looky ! 
Mmkay my vid is up for anyone who cares xD 
A TRUE friend doesn't care when you're broke , being a brat , what you weigh , if your house is a mess , what you drive , about your past , or if your family is filled with CRAZY people . Your conversations pick up where they left off , even if they have been months apart . They love you for who you are . Re-post if you have at least one true friend . They will know who they are ..... thank you ? 
I'm pretty sure I'm back to my normal self now xD Thanks < PROPFEMALE > for talking with me about stuff ! You're the best ! :D 
just flew into jupiter in a space sim with my < PROPMALE > Dom xD 
Had fun at Boondocks yesterday with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > ! Played some laser tag ( I totally failed xD ) Probably gonna go with them again next Friday too , when we have more money to spend :D 
Grr , I don't know what i'm sick with , probably the flu . >.< I want to go to school ! 
I will be at school tomorrow :P I feel a lot better but i'm still sick xD 
Yay for going to Idaho ... /sarcasm 
I was playing my space game again , finally intercepted ISS , I was about 2500 meters below it at first , but after a few altitude changes , and passing it a ton of times , I finally was able to dock with it xD Then I decided to be a nazi and knock it into the Earth's atmosphere , hehehe >:D 
Going to go work on my Dad's plane , since it's nice and not < PROPFEMALE > today :D 
Got to taxi my Dad's plane ! He walked me through everything I needed to do to start it up also . So it was a lot of fun :D 
Ugh .. I'm tired of being on the computer all day long >.< 
Well , I guess I got pneumonia ( Ignore the P if you have no clue what I'm talking about ) :/ Kinda sucks , but i'll get better !!! xD 
Finally got Team Fortress 2 xD Also got Supreme Commander 2 , it was pretty cheap on steam , so it's probably not too good , but the first SC was decent , so I figured it couldn't be any worse xD 
THE GAME ! You just lost it !

Dang , the hard enemies on Supreme Commander are ... HARD ! They just build and attack way too fast o.o It's scares me ! But I can defeat an Easy ( Duh ! ) or normal enemy no sweat ! 
Played some Supreme Commander 2 with my friend < PROPFIRST > , had a lot of fun until we he had to go in the middle of a match , when were were against a hard enemy and some random guy ... Yeah I didn't last too long >.< Oh well , it was still fun :P

Gah , I hate this mission on Supreme Commander 2 ! I can't get past it ! 
Finally beat Supreme Commander 2 xD The last mission wasn't all too bad actually , except I hit the unit compacity a few times because of all the defensive structures I had , but I managed to find some useless units and self-destruct them , giving me enough space to make some experimental factories , and then destroying the enemy xD

Just got Fallout New Vegas , never played any of the fallout games before so I hope I like it :p But so far my DVD drive is being a nazi and not detecting the disc >.< Thankfully it's a steam game :D I <3 Steam ! 
The Crysis 2 demo for the PC fails ! The games won't even start >.< I'm going back to the original Crysis , something the console nerds will never get to play >:D 
Meh , Crysis 2 feels more like FEAR & CoD instead of Crysis 
Hmm .. what to do .. I'm bored of Fallout and idk what else to play xD I would play Command and Conquer Generals with my < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Timmons but my DVD drive only wants to run certain disks , and even then , those are a pain to get working right >.< 
I'm trying to make a Strike at Karkand map for C&C Generals xD You Battlefield 2 ( PC ) players will know what I'm talking to about :p I've played on that map for 6 years just about , so I know it pretty much

I'm tempted to go around saying \Photoshopped ! \ " on every random pic I see xD " 
Had an epic battle with < PROPFIRST > Timmons ! It was crazy xD He had a load of tanks , and I have a ton of choppers , and a huge defensive wall around my base , oh it was crazy ! I ended up winning with ... idk how many choppers , atleast 120 or so I swear ! I had sooo many ! It was funny though xD The game lasted 2 hours :p

I'm bringing Battlefield 2 with me to school today , because I can ! xD 
Got a black plastic AK-47 , it looks like the one from MW2 . It's ok I guess , The sight on it is pretty cool , and there's a light that lights up the BB's so you can see them better in the dark 
Dang the < PROPFEMALE > is really bright tonight ! Good thing it's a clear night , too bad it's cold though .. 
I bought 6 things of Capri Sun from the RO room today , I felt insane xD 
Finally got Crysis 2 < PROPFEMALE > xD I hope the Campaign is as good as the original 
Just beat Crysis 2 Campaign on Post-Human Warrior difficulty xD With the crosshairs off also 
Define \Terrorist \"" 
< PROPFIRST > Timmons is a little hobo because I haven't talked to him in what feels like a week ! I shall soon change that ! Little punk ! xD 
For some reason , I think I'm only going to see half of the people I planned on when I visit Alaska , idk why o.o
