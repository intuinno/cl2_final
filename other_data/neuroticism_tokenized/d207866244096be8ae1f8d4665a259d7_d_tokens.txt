These friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it's been or how far away they live and don't hold grudges . They understand that life is busy and that you will always love them ! Re-post if you are lucky enough to have these friends

BROTHER'S WEEK !

I've carried children within my body . Slept with babies on my chest . I've kissed boo boos and mended broken hearts . I've been puked on , peed on , and spent sleepless nights in the rocking chair . But I wouldn't have it any other way . My body isn't magazine perfect but when I look in the mirror I see a MOM and there is no greater honor or blessing !! Post if you are a mom !!!
