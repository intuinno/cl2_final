What's up with < PROPFEMALE > Fawcett & < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > both dying on the same day ?! 

Wishing things would've been better . Looking forward to San < PROPMALE > . 
It's getting cold . Time to migrate south ! 
Hmmm . It's chillier than I though down here in Southern California . Only in the mid-50s during the day . :-) 
Job-hunting in < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > ! Hmmm ... Baywatch was filmed here . :-) 
It's really wet down here ; reminds me of Oregon . At least I found a job already , here in wet < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Ah ! Sand , surf & sunshine ! What else is there ?! 
40 ?! Really ?! 
A grandfather ?! 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone ! 
Yes ! I'll admit it ! I'm in love ... with Goldfrapp ! 
Happy New Year everyone ! I really enjoyed 2010 , but I think 2011 is going to be the BEST !!! 
Good things come to those who wait I always hear . So I gotta have < PROPFEMALE > which I've been running short on lately . Not enough yoga it seems ! 
Trying to absorb a new role for our theater performance this afternoon . :-( Lots of dialogue to remember , but no rehearsals . Oh well , gotsta roll with it ... :-) 
< PROPMALE>'s such a great show ! Just finished season 2 ! I heard it all just goes down hill from there so I'll stop watching the series ... & if you believe that ... 
Looking forward to visiting Portland again ... and Oregon period . Gotta try real hard to take the sun with me ... 
Happy with my place in < PROPFEMALE > Beach !!! 
Handlebar ' stache is coming off ! Its time has passed ! R.I.P ! Sorry to all my ' stache fans in Sunset ! Ha'ha'ha'ha! ( unless I can be convinced otherwise ... ) 
Right ! Who's got a boil on their semprini then ? 
< PROPMALE > Python Marathon !!! Aagh ! Can't get enough ! 
I love yoga ! To the core ! 
Acting silly is my forté baby ! 
You know ? It's kind've funny when you're quite inebriated & then write on all your friends ' walls ! It sparks all kinds of zany & wacky conversations . Some that you have to explain yourself later , but others you leave with an air of mystery ... Oh thank you Lord for creating alcohol ... yes ! I did mean thank you Lord . So many monks making mead can not have been too far wrong ... 
Ahhh ... The \voices\ " are coming ... " 
Gonna get wild & crazy with the Sunset Crew !!! 
Sunset Crew Rocks ... and it rocks hard !!! Dancefloor mayhem ?! Oh yeah ! Wednesday night you jokers !!! 
Ahhh ... late night intensive yoga ! Dedication & devotion make it a priority no matter what the hour ! 
Red Light Wednesday at Townhouse in < PROPFEMALE > ! 
A bust ! A bust ! A bust ! 
So , you finally get that day to sleep in , wake up refreshed , greet the late morning sun shining through the window with a smile , say hello to the world , think life's good ... then you realize your vehicle was parked in a tow zone from the night before ! Eyes widen in sudden panic as you try to remember if you really did or not , or if you moved it as planned ! Damn ! Yoga calm takes over , ahhh ... well , lesson learned . :-) 
All the real world problems I think I may have still cannot compare in any way to the loss sustained by so many families & the nation as a whole nine years past . Thank you to all the servicemen & women who risk so much to keep these acts from recurring . 
I love it jokers create my status for me ! :-) 
I love pencil < PROPMALE > 
I really gotta sign out when I'm not around my phone ! Co-workers ... 
Wth ? It ' below freezing in Malibu ! I think there are icicles forming on the eves ! There's even a little penguin or two waddling around ! Well ... slight exageration on the penguins ... & maybe the icicles ... it may not even be below freezing . But it is cold ! 
Copernicus was full of it ! I could almost swear the sun < PROPFEMALE > & then sank back down , beyond the hills ! This so-called \star\ " has a mind of it's own . Maybe Helios ' steeds forgot their shoes . Science is a farce !... maybe I'm just a little disoriented ... :-( " 
About to do a good yoga session & then off to do my voices ! Yeah !!! 
Voice class was awesome ! Chilling with Mr. Amon Tobin ( well the music ) & Bonobo ! Ah good ole groovin ' acid jazz ... 
Ahhh ... co-workers . Especially the boss ... 
Absinthe is rough ! 
I'm gonna grow the ole mullet ! I don't care what anybody says ! I'm bringing it back baby ! 
I hate it when you go to a \gathering\ " where you have to take your shoes off & at the end of the night someone takes your good shoes and your left with someone's old beaters ... :-( " 
LSATs !!! LSATs !!! LSATs !!! Focus ... focus ... focus ... 
< PROPFIRST > Retter is my favorite 
< PROPFIRST > Retter is NO LONGER my favorite ... 
Canned applause accompanies my every move ... 
The Blancmanges mean to win Wimbledon !

Excited about my first official audition Monday !

Hmmm ... I think there WAS something extra in those brownies ... 
Hanging out with a cuz I haven't seen in 25 years ... 
Learning how to be dissociative in my identity ... so am I ... I am too ... 
I just saw two huge piles of snow in < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > ! 
Happy that I gave up my Saturday night for a good cause ! 
Great grooves tonight ! Thanks Pad & < PROPMALE > ! Libertine on Monday nights sounds like a great recurring event !!! 
So , is this blood stuff for real ? According to my blood type , I cannot eat wheat , corn , chicken , turkey , ham or tomatoes ! That cuts out bread , tortillas , cereal , chips , pizza w/tomato sauce , etc , etc , etc , etc , etc !!!! ALL my favorite foods . I really want to cry , well , figuratively ! 
I'm proud to have served my country & I thank all those who came before me & who've served since for their selfless sacrifices ! 
Wandering through my apartment now feels as if I'm wandering through the Redwood < PROPMALE > of NW Cali ! My neph brought down more of my books ! Now I have stacks & stacks to organize ( hoping they miss me when they decide to topple ) . But it IS the facade of erudition that I AM ATTEMPTING to display ... 
Ahhh ... the sun's gentle rays warm my upturned face as I stare into the endless blue expanse above me ... 
Little < PROPFEMALE > Foo-Foo hopping through the < PROPMALE > !

Eating the dough actually sounds REALLY good ! 
I love all these \Singles Ads\ " on my profile ! They all say women are waiting to meet \ " Me\ " ! It's great ! Didn't know I was so popular ! " 
I guess if everything turned out just the way you wanted it to in real life it just wouldn't be real ... 
I just want to be made of stone ...
