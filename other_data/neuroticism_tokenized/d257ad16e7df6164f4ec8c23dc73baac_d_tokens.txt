twisted lies despise my rise to the skies , better to fly high than crawl and die , all the pain and hurt caused by lies emotions polluted like new york skies , living bloated bodies like maggots and flies , i fly high to stay away from the destruction , constantly building like a master of construction 
my words are stone , my mind is metal , evil forces trying to crash in the walls of my everlasting < PROPFEMALE > , if a few of em dont fall Jah know the rest will , this is a testament to my knowledge and skill , it only takes a few bars for the words to sink in and kill , doing more damage to your brain than an ecxtasy pill . 
time to wash the pain away like a bad disease always said the kid was a bastard seed please beleive the meanest deed was letting your face bleed

Doesn't make sense , does it ? Homeless in the US go without eating . Elderly in the US go without needed medicines . Mentally ill in the US go without treatment . American troops go without proper equipment . American veterans go without benefits that were promised . Yet we donate billions to other countries before helping our own first . 1% will re-post and 99% won't . Have the guts to re-post this . I KNOW I'M IN THE 1% 
woke up feeling good vibes its going to be a good month many things to celebrate
