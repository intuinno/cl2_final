I would really like to have a pet hedgehog . 
And so ends a once beautiful relationship . Damn you , Blizzard . 
Sometimes it feels like the things I want are so far out of reach that it is silly to bother dreaming . 
Welp . Until this frilled < PROPFIRST > game decides to up and die , I'll be off doing other fancy internet bits . Enjoy your nonsensities ! 
Lololololololol . I got separated from my work pals for being too chatty just like in those high school days . It feels good to irritate The Man to the point of action . 
What a long day of work ... 
just wrapped for a fellow that was either gay or British . I'm not certain which . 
Being a mom rocks . 
works at 5 a.m. tomorrow . I suppose it's bedtime .

Fraidy Kat is three months old ! <3

would like to get her hair done . 
If you're at an intersection and you don't use a blinker then fuck you . 
woke up at five just to be told she didn't have to come to work until eight . Long day will be long . 
Why are the words on my computer so < PROPFEMALE > ?! 
He's a jerk . But he's my jerk . And I right fancy that . 
The day's end is sweet when you die in my dreams . 
>.> I got brownie in my eye ...

Commercial tagline : \Tired of mainstream music ? Listen to A Day to Remember . \ " Lol'd . " 
is watching more Black Butler with dearest < PROPMALE > . 
The only downside to having such a beautiful daughter is that everyone wants to stop and ogle . Murr hurr . :3 
What's that ruckus ? What's that ruckus ? What's that ruckus comin ' through the night ? 
Would you lie with me and just forget the world ? 
No . I am not pregnant . Though I am horribly aware of how much extra weight I still have . Thank you for your concern , old women of Paragould . 
After a powerhouse starter's workout at the hospital , it is donut time ! 
Seven months and growing fast . <3 
I always feel a strong sense of pride after successfully cutting my own bangs . 
feels delightful from a good night gymming .
