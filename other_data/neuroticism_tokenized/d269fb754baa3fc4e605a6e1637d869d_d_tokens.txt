Just spent two hours walking around in the freezing cold and wind looking for a building that wasn't the right one in the first place . Sweet . 

Is anything going on ? Does anyone want to do something ? Kinda going crazy sitting at home by myself every day . @.@

To the douchebags who stole our bikes : fuck you . 
Another thoroughly disappointing day . Disappointed most of all in myself . 
I went into the kitchen to find something quick to munch on and ended up making a pot of roasted tomato and < PROPMALE > soup . : x 
Had a really fun time last night at CS ~ 
Does anyone know the best way to fix an inverted sleep schedule ? I'm tired of sleeping during the day/afternoon and missing stuff or being insanely tired if I do manage to wake up for things , but nothing I've tried has worked .

Just woke up from a horrible nightmare ... reality isn't better . 
Every day I'm thankful for all the friends that I've made this past year . You continue to help me to come out of my shell and realize that life is worth living . I've done things I've never dreamed possible because of you , and I know that it's going to get even better .

For Christmas dinner I made roast beef , Yorkshire pudding , caramelized onions , stuffed mushrooms , < PROPFEMALE > pie , and creme de menthe martini sundaes . Sooooooo yummy ! And I'm so happy I got to share it with the one I love .

Should I go to the party tonight ? I'm really not sure how I feel .. :( 
Why am I up :( 
Anyone know sure I can sit for six hours and have internet access as late as 10:30 ? 
I really really really need Ethernet based internet access today from 4:00 to 10:30 today , I have no power at my house cos they're replacing a pole someone hit , and I need to work today . Can anyone please help me ? 
What's nice about my bedroom window being broken and stuck open is that it smells awesome in here now because of the rain and copious cuddles will be needed to stay warm tonight . 
I'm so bored ... I miss being able to do stuff . :( 
New hair , new clothes , new shoes ... good day . < :3
