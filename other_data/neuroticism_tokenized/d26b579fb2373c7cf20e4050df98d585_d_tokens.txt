If you are reading this , whether we do or \

that pops in your head , when you've finished , post this paragraph on \ 
your own status . You'll be surprised what people remember about you . 

I just baked 14 dozen cookies : walnut chocolate chip , gingersnaps , and sugar cookies with sprinkles . Whew ! It heated up the house so , after pulling out the hot air with the whole house fan , the air conditioner is now on . Hungry anyone ? 
HAPPY 4TH OF JULY TO EVERYONE ! FLY YOUR FLAGS SUNDAY AND MONDAY :-) 
It's turned wonderfully cool ! The windows are open , the rain is falling , and I'm going to need a blanket on my bed . Yea ! 
Although I love the shade that my neighbor's cottonwood trees provide , I hate those runners that come up in my yard . Grrrrr ! I cut them all down this morning . I am now taking bets on how fast they grow back . 
I bought Land's End mesh water shoes for my brother , my son , and myself for our September trip to Kauai . Thinking about the ocean and matching my heartbeat to the waves . Ahhhhh . 
Okay , we need sunshine so our tomatoes will grow and ripen . My two eggplants have 10 blossoms so far . The hot peppers are going to town as is the < PROPMALE > . There are beautiful zucchini blossoms , cucumber blooms , and parsley too . 
I went to my first Credit Union Supervisory Committee meeting this afternoon . We represent the teachers and their families who have accounts at Arapahoe Credit Union . So if you have an account there and have questions , concerns , etc . let me know so I can do my job . 
By the way , Arapahoe Credit Union gives scholarships to freshmen and career students . You have to have an account with us , live in Arapahoe County , and write a bit about your goals for the future . I'll post when the info goes out in January or February , but opening an account now would be smart . 
The heat is back ! Looks like I need to shut up the house and turn on the a.c. so the upstairs isn't so hot for < PROPMALE > . The veggies are loving it though . I can almost see them growing . 
< PROPFIRST > & I went to Sunflower Market . Yum , fresh figs ! Lotsa goodies . 
I'm weary . Taking care of < PROPMALE > is wearing on me , and so are the church's problems . I took Sunday off to repair my soul and get back on top of my feelings . So far , so good . I hate being down-in-the-dumps for long . 
Thanks , everyone , for listening to my sad rant yesterday . I feel so much more clarity after having my small say and reading your responses . Don't you love it when you can put your life back into perspective after it's tilted ? Time and friends ... that's what I needed . 
It is going to be a scorcher today . Whew ! I read the paper over coffee on the patio , and when the sun blazed around the corner of my neighbor's house at 7:15 , it got very warm : 78 at 8 A.M. Yuck < PROPFEMALE > ! 
It's 12:30 P.M. and 90 . Lord have mercy ! Send us cloud cover soon ! 
I don't miss the humidity at all , < PROPFEMALE > . It was 8% humidity here yesterday and today . Yes , I said 8% . Very dry . We could use some rain . 
Today's weather is soooo much cooler : 88 at 3:30 P.M. There was some cloud cover earlier this afternoon , and that held down the temperature . I didn't have a < PROPMALE > to water the GrowBoxes this morning , and boy did they need water by the time I got home from church . The zucchini leaves looked like they were melting ! 
There was another big zuke ready to pick . I also have mucho peppers \ 
that are almost big enough to harvest as well as jalapenos . A few \ 
< PROPFEMALE > tomatoes have redden , and there are the beginnings of both yellow\ 
and regular size garden tomatoes . Then there are the eggplants : at \ 
least 14 blossoms on each of two plants ! The < PROPMALE > is tasty as is the \ 
< PROPFEMALE > . Add the parsley , and we have a party going on ;-) 
I love Monday mornings . Of course , there's always coffee and the paper on the patio , but < PROPMALE>'s brother , < PROPMALE > , calls him for their weekly chat at 8:30 A.M. Not many people correspond with < PROPMALE > so this is always a great time for him , and in turn , for me . Thanks , < PROPMALE > , for being a super brother !

I awoke to thunder claps , but none of the good wet stuff . It was a gorgeous day : highs in the low to mid eighties and now rain , coming straight down . It almost doesn't look real , but the dogs didn't want to venture out so it must be truly wet ! 
Calling all people who live near Hampden and Tower ! \ 
Come join us for St. < PROPFIRST>'s Music on the Rise this Saturday . Dinner is free : hamburgers and dogs on the grill . Bring a side or dessert to share . We start the food at 6:30 P.M. and the folk music at 7:15 . Bring blankets , lawn chairs , etc . for the concert on the north lawn . Hope to see you and your friends there ! 
< PROPMALE>'s cousin , < PROPFEMALE > , had a heart transplant last night and is doing well . Her family asks for prayers for her and the donor's family who so selflessly gave so others might live . 
Got the A.C. in my CR-V fixed for $1600 . Geez , at least I didn't need a whole new unit : that would have cost $2500 . 
< PROPMALE > Ford cantalope , mixed mushrooms , blueberries ( for only $ ! a pint ) , red < PROPFEMALE > peppers , roasted chiles , and a Mediterranean breakfast pita at the < PROPFEMALE > Creek Farmer's Market : this was my first time there this season . Yummy ! 
A karaoke fundraiser will be held Friday , August 6 from 6:30 - 9 P.M. in the St. < PROPFIRST > Presbyterian Celebration Center . \ 
\ 
Drag\ 
the family and friends out for a crazy evening of songs . $3 lets you\ 
sing a song , $5 allows you to name someone else to sing a song , and $10\ 
pays for insurance so you don't have to sing a song . \ 
Free snacks & face-painting too ! 
I made strawberry , raspberry , blueberry freezer jam Monday and am making Black < PROPFEMALE > apricot nectarine jam today . I already made a nectarine cake using puree as the liquid : hope it's yummy ! 
The library just called with my 5th book in a week's time . Can I really\ 
read that much in three weeks before the books are due ? Guess I'll \ 
have to try ;-) 
There's a cool front headed to Colorado for the weekend . After we enjoy it , I'll personally send it to the Midwest ! 
Okay ! The cool front is moving towards Kansas ! At least you'll be in the 80s for a bit . Much better than the 100s :-) 
Thirty days until my brother , son , and I leave for Kauai ! The countdown begins ... 
Thanks to all who sent birthday wishes to me . I had a nice day - nothing fancy but just plain nice . 
I canned some wonderful eggplant tomato relish this morning . It's full of kalamata olives , toasted pine nuts , < PROPMALE > , onions , eggplant , tomatoes , and red wine vinegar . Now on to salsa ! 
Those of you going to Aunt < PROPFIRST>'s 80th birthday party tomorrow , give her a big hug for me ! 
Thanks , < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > , for the beautiful flowers and vase . You shouldn't have , but I'm so glad you did ! 
Order from Land's End this weekend and mention the 25% off on all merchandise , even on the overstocks . I certainly saved a great deal ;-) 
< PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , and I leave for Kauai , Hawaii 2 weeks from today ! Woo hoo ! ( We have to leave the house at 3 A.M. though . Not complaining . ) 
< PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , & < PROPMALE > Lefebvre and other family from England and < PROPFEMALE > outlasted Hurricane < PROPMALE > in N . < PROPFEMALE > this week . I'm waiting to see pictures of < PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE > in their snorkeling gear as they braved the elements outside their rental . Don't ya love crazy people ? 
The canning of < PROPFEMALE>'s garden salsa is finished : jars are cooling on the counter . I only had to purchase cilantro ; the garden provided everything else . Oh yea , I made it spicy hot ! 
< PROPFEMALE>'s got her boot off and is walking on her healed foot . Watch out though , the doctor is letting her drive again after 6 weeks off . Zooooooooooom ! 
I was just thinking how fast news makes it across the country today . Back during the Civil War it sometimes took 4 months to get a newspaper from Washington , D.C. to Kentucky . No wonder life was simpler then . Your world went uninterrupted for days , weeks , months at a time . 
BROTHER\ 
WEEK ... If you have a brother who has made you laugh , pulled your hair , \ 
stuck-up for you , drove you crazy , hugged you , watched you succeed , saw \ 
you fall , picked you back up , cheered you on , made you strong , can't do \ 
with out then copy and paste this to your status 
One week from today I'll be waking the the sound of waves on Kauai's north shore . Aloha paradise ! 
I tried the new shellac nail process today , hoping to keep my nails looking great for 2-4 weeks . It's a longer ( and more expensive ) process , but I can tell the difference already . 
See the first photos of our trip to Kauai by going to my info < PROPFEMALE > , scrolling down clear to the bottom , and clicking on my blogsite . Aloha ! 
A huge thank you to < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE>'s brother , and his wife , < PROPFEMALE > , for staying with < PROPMALE > while we were in Hawaii ! I could never have gone if not for them . Merci < PROPMALE > coup ! 
I'm thinking stuffed pork chops for dinner , cooked in apple cider . Yum ! 
I'm procrastinating right now . I need to start laundry and run a couple of errands , but that would mean changing from my comfy robe to clothes . Ah , the life of a retired woman .... 
Okay , I'm getting serious about walking . Today Sears delivered my new treadmill . Happy Christmas , < PROPFEMALE > ! 
It's National Coming Out Day . I'm a straight ally blessed by the love , work , and faithfulness of so many LGBTQ people . I am coming out to work and pray for inclusion . Equality . Compassion . Freedom from persecution . But more ... Celebration . Voice . Hope . \ 
( Thanks , JD , for letting me copy your note . ) 
St. < PROPFIRST > Presbyterian welcomes Dr. < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > as our temporary , par t-t ime pastor . < PROPMALE > is a wonderfully positive gentleman with a lively demeanor . Come join us at our 10:15 A.M. worship : be the change you want to see in the world ! 
It's cool and sprinkling a bit : perhaps some warmed apple cider , a blanket , and a book . 
I have everything done for < PROPFIRST > and Richardo's commitment ceremony tomorrow except for sugaring the nuts for the spinach salad . Yea ! 
I hope you've been watching the new NBC show , School Pride , on Fridays at 7 P.M. These wonderful people fix up schools across the nation , like Extreme Home Makeover but affecting many more lives . \ 
Watch with your children . Talk about what they have , and how we all might help . 
It's sad to realize that many children right here in the U.S. have a \ 
second tier education because their facility and equipment are falling \ 
apart . Prison inmates have far better facilities than the future of our\ 
country . \ 
P.S. You'll cry too . 
Six pumpkin bundt cakes finished for Sunday's consecration dinner at church . My house smells wonderful ! 
Okay , taking these tests are rather wacky but also kind of fun . But < PROPFIRST > Swift and Pirates of the Carribean ? Please ! 
One thing I don't miss about teaching : middle schoolers trying to sneak < PROPFEMALE > into my classroom ! I used to let them bring in and eat whatever they wanted the day after Halloween . The one rule was they had to share with others at their table . By 10:30 A.M. they were all pretty much sick of < PROPFEMALE > . BOO-HA-HA ! 
Okay , who has Midnight Milky Ways ? I love those mini bites ! 
Today I moved items in my lower cabinets around so they'd be better spots for mixing , baking , storage , etc . That lead to wiping out the insides of the cabinets and then the outside doors , which were grimy . I pulled a few items I don't use any more for ARC . Whew , that was a workout , but everything looks so much better as well as being located in better spots . I now need a nap ;-D 
Yea ! No more political ads ! 
Social justice ... listen all you newly elected officials ... we need social justice issues to be addressed in a Christian manner . Heal , feed , shelter - get the picture ? 
This deer has two sets of antlers and a drop . Pretty amazing . Photo taken in Colorado Springs . 
What a gorgeous November day here in the Mile high City . Highs are supposed to be in the upper 70s . What's wrong with this picture ? 
Every\ 
single one of you are on my friend list as a result of a conscious \ 
decision . I wanted you there ! I am not only glad to count you as friend , \ 
but also as my family . Lets see who on my friend list actually pays \ 
attention . Copy and paste this as your status . Thank you for being part \ 
of my life ! 
So I finally grow out my fingernails , and they have been looking good for the past three months . I hate it when one breaks ! Makes me think about biting them again . LOL ! 
Dear Kansas friends , \ 
We're sending snow your way . Yippee ! 
Up bright and early ( 5:30 ) to bake a pie for tonight's Mid Week Gathering and send < PROPFIRST > off to work with a bagel and a smear . ( He normally only drinks coffee in the A . M . ) I also finished the book , The Happiness Project , and resolve to start my own changes to be happier . The good thing is , I have already started - back in September ! 
Today is beautiful : a half inch of snow dusting the green grass , bright sunshine to add < PROPFEMALE > to the early hours , and cold temps to make one \brrr\ " and smile as the heat comes on . " 
Lots to do today : bake pie ( check ) , return library book , attend Credit Union Supervisory Comm . meeting , buy 16 beeswax candles for the Christmas candelabra at church as well as an Advent set and Christ candle , meet a friend for a drink , attend Mid Week Gathering and choir . I love being busy ! 
OMG ! The Broncos beat Kansas City . We should have been playing like this all year ! 
Out for sushi tonight with < PROPFIRST > at the Samurai . They had tamago-yum ! 
It was good to have < PROPFEMALE > Jenkins join us for Elderberries today ! 
Woo hoo , my Christmas shopping is done ! Now I just have to make several items from the kits I purchased . Next on the list is Christmas cards and then decorating the house . And yes , I'm pretty much bragging . 
Sunday the 21st St. < PROPFIRST > will be celebrating Thanksgiving at 10:15 A.M. I'd love for you all to join us . Wednesday the 24th is our Thanksgiving Vesper service at 6:45 P.M. followed by a pie social . Praise God for all we have been given and YUM for the pies ! 
Making brandied < PROPFEMALE > bread pudding for the pie social at church after vespers service tonight ( 6:45 p . m . ) - We need something besides pie ! 
We ate at 2 and just had pie at 5 . I wonder if we'll hold out til bedtime ? 
Made turkey stew with homemade dumplings for supper . Warm and yummy . 
Rev . < PROPMALE > is teaching the Mid Week Gathering class at St. < PROPFIRST > Presbyterian Church for the next 4 weeks ! You can join us for dinner at 6 P.M. or come just for class at 6:30 P.M. But come ! 
I wrapped presents today . Now I need a tree to put them under so < PROPFIRST > and I are off to the tree lot :-D 
I started a daily regimen of walking on my treadmill yesterday . I'm going slow so as to get my arthritic knees used to the idea . Tonight they are aching , but I walked anyway . Time for Advil Liqui-Gels ! 
I finally had the gutters cleaned , and were they ever full of my neighbor's pine needles ! It can rain or snow now : my house is ready . 
Don't forget to bring hats and mittens as well as toys for the St. < PROPFIRST > Giving tree . Operation Christmas Child boxes are due by the 9th ! Help others this season and feel the warmth of love spread throughout your body . 
Change\ 
your facebook profile picture to a cartoon from your childhood and \ 
invite your friends to do the same . Until Monday ( Dec 6 ) there should be\ 
no human faces on facebook , but an invasion of memories . This is for a \ 
campaign against violence against children . 
Couldn't see the face of \Maxine\ " 
3 Yrs old : \mommy i love you . \ " 10 yrs old : \ " mom whatever . \ " 16 yrs old : \ " omg mom ur so annoying ! \ " 18 yrs old : \ " i wanna leave this house . \ " 25 yrs old : \ " mom you were right . \ " 30 yrs old : \ " I wanna go back to my moms house . \ " 50 yrs old : \ " I dont wanna lose my mom . \ " 70 yrs old : \ " I would ... give up anything just to have my mom here ... with me . \ " You only have one mom . Repost if you love your mom " 
Taking the < PROPFIRST > in for a check-up and a new battery . Every time we go to use it , the thing is dead . Of course if we drove it more ... 
Icicle lights are up and on thanks to < PROPFIRST > ! 
So excited for the NBC accapella singing show tonight ! 
OMG ! What superb singing on \The Sing Off\ " tonight . The groups are all over the place : high school to < PROPFIRST > Lawson and the Talk of the Town to the Whiffenpoofs . WOWEE ! I just love the singing !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! " 
If you weren't at Dreamweavers ' holiday < PROPFEMALE > concert last night , you missed some marvelous music and a few good laughs ! Thanks for sharing the wonder of your music with us . 
What a musical weekend I had ! I took time off just for me to hear Dreamweavers ( bells ) , a carillon concert at D.U. , lessons and carols at a friend's church , and a party . Woo hoo ! I luxuriated in \time for me \"." 
I only have one more place to remove < PROPMALE>'s name so we can get the trust started now that he's 59.5 . This could be the hardest since it's transfering the Texas land and mineral rights to < PROPFIRST > . Wish me luck and send any helpful hints ! 
Have to get to the store today . Baking must get done tomorrow or Thursday at the latest . Found a new cake recipe with almond paste and apricots . 
Boy , I got the edge of something about 3 A.M. today . Nothing < PROPMALE > , just a stomach that feels curdled . I'm staying close to home , curling up with the cat under a blanket , and reading The Pillars of the Earth . 
MAke memories today : be silly , goofy , extra loving ( hugs all around ) , wear the hats and antlers , take photos , sing , and rejoice that Jesus was born to save us all . < PROPFEMALE > CHRISTmas ! 
We had brunch for lunch ( blueberry french toast , fruit salad , sausages ) since < PROPFIRST > worked this morning . We opened presents a bit later : < PROPFEMALE > did a fine job by all of us ! We drank mimosas all afternoon , and then I napped a bit before < PROPFIRST > returned to work . Ern did a great job being downstairs :-) 
I only have my brother in town for one more day :-( At least he's leaving in front of the snow that I hope ( pray ) we'll get ! 
Sushi tonight with my brother and my two guys . < PROPMALE > leaves for home tomorrow ;-( 
My brother left this morning . I got up at 5:30 and got him a dozen Einstein bagels to take home since there isn't an Einsteins within 75 < PROPMALE > of his town . I went in my beautiful red bathrobe with hood . Hopefully , it looked like a sweatsuit . LOL ! 
< PROPFIRST > cleared the driveway before he went to work this morning at 5:45 ( yawn ) . I've done it once again . Shoot , we only got 5\ on the south side of the metro area . I was hoping for more ! This cold ( 2 ) is not good however . Brrrr ! " 
I just made a photo album for < PROPFIRST>'s 26th birthday ( Saturday ) online at Walgreens . I hope it turns out well ! 
Isn't it a gorgeous day out ? It makes me very happy to have sun and still some snow . 
Saw the weather report for Sunday and Monday so I stocked up at the grocery store . I'm ready so pile the snow up ! 
It's pretty bad when I choose laundry and housework over completing an annual report that's due tomorrow . LOL ! 
< PROPFIRST > turns 26 tomorrow , OMG ! That means I have to up my \pretend\ " age . " 
I took < PROPFIRST > to Pappadeaux's for his birthday lunch and tried to be good . The emphasis is on tried . 
< PROPFIRST>'s getting some fancy exhaust for his WRX this afternoon . I'm thinking it's going to be much louder when he comes home every day . LOL ! 
Brrrrr ! It is cold , but the snow is beautiful . We turned the outside Christmas lights back on to celebrate the added moisture . 
10:30 P.M. and -2 degrees . Brrrrrr . 
My Christmas and Thanksgiving cactuses bloomed 5 times each in 2010 , and now one is ready to bloom all fushia again ! 
It isn't often ( like almost never ) that I have completely forgotten a meeting . I'm sorry Credit Union Supervisory Committee members ! I hadn't calendared it . Sad for me as I pride myself on doing what I say I'll do . 
First it rained and turned to black ice . And now the snow is here in Colorado The temperature hit 17 and is headed downward . Brrr . High tomorrow -1 and low -17 with 3-4 inches of snow forecast . We're sending it your way , Kansas family ! 
Brrrza ! I'd let the three dogs sleep with me tonight , but they're already cozied up in their blankets ! Hopefully the two cats will feel like cuddling :-) 
Beef stew is in the crock pot , and laundry is on the list too . Maybe I can finish Pillars of the Earth today as well . I shoveled one path down the drive for the newspaper , and my lungs were frozen . Be careful out there ! I , for one , am not going anywhere today . (-10 ) 
One of my favorite views out my bedroom window on a snowy day are the concentric rings made by < PROPFIRST>'s Subaru ! Fun for him , and < PROPMALE > for me . 
I've got to try to start my car . It's been sitting outside this entire time , and I'm certain it probably won't want to turn over . It's up to -1 so when we hit zero I'll go out . 
Wow , my car started right up after sitting outside for two very cold nights ! Never underestimate a good battery . 
Tonight is the season premiere of \Who Do You Think You Are ? \ " on NBC at 7 P.M. MST . This show is so addictive if you're at all interested in geneology . Give it a try ! " 
I'm so excited ! While cleaning the hall closet so I could donate more coats , jackets , and winter-wear , I can across a bag of memorabilia hidden behind the boots . In it were family items I thought I had lost : dad's 8th grade graduation certificate and < PROPFIRST>'s baby calendar to name a few . I had so much fun reading about < PROPFIRST>'s first year events again ! 
Here comes the snow ... again ! At least it isn't beastly cold this time . 
This snow is a wet one - very like a spring snow almost . 
Put the 4th Annual St. < PROPFIRST > Talent Show and Dinner on your calendar : Saturday , 19 February at 6 P.M. Cost is $10 ($% for kids ) with the proceeds going to the vocal and < PROPFEMALE > choir programs . Come ya'll! 
< PROPFIRST > and I went to Safeway where we had a great laugh . There was this gigantic empty space on the shelf in the cheese section . When would Velveeta ever run out ? Right before the Super Bowl ! ( and no , we weren't looking to buy it ) 
My brother texted last night to say that Emporia State University was closed today so he planned to sleep in . 
For the first time in Westminster Dog Show history , the < PROPFEMALE > Deerhound won best in show ! 
Loved the St. < PROPFIRST > Talent Show and dinner tonight ! Thanks to everyone who made it such a success ! 
Off to work on the Presbyterian General Assembly report at church with < PROPFIRST > this morning . Gee , what else would we want to do on President's Day ? LOL ! We're hoping very few people are on the site since they are out doing other stuff ( like we want to be ) . 
All the < PROPMALE > reports are in ! Now I just need to pull all the session minutes together for 2010 , locate all the pieces that had to take place , < PROPFIRST > them , and head to the clerk's meeting on 12 March . Yea ! 
I've been so busy doing lots for others this past that I'm staying home doing nothing today ! 
I just finished copying all the words under the tenor part for our Easter cantata . Whew ! But now I can actually sing the words as we learn the pieces ! 
I totally cleaned out my refrigerator today , taking out the drawers and shelving . Everything got washed down . I went through all those jars in the door too , tossing a few . The freezer section was harder as you can't take out the entire drawer to clean it , but boy was my effort ever worth the time ! And don't even ask me to do yours ! LOL . I was at it for over an hour . 
I'm so sick of < PROPFIRST > Sheen and < PROPFIRST > Lohan ! Both are such narcissists . Take away their right to publicize themselves in the press , please . Ugh ! They are definitely not the role models I want kids to see and hear . 
Prepping suppers at Dream Dinners this morning then taking my beautiful but shedding Miss < PROPFEMALE > to the groomer . She's got that < PROPFEMALE > Retriever/chow hair : 7\ of reddish gold . There are tufts of it all over the house ! " 
Gotta love this quote :\ 
Handle every stressful situation like a dog . \ 
Pee on it and walk away !

Made a new recipe found on the perimeter of Facebook for coffee time after church tomorrow : apple bundt cake . Ern says it's good . Hope so ! 
Got my hair cut and styled this afternoon while catching up with my close friend , < PROPMALE > , and hair stylist , Rhonda : my lifelines to insane laughter ! 
Since I have Mid Week Gathering and choir on Wednesdays , I tape Criminal Minds and its new spin off . Tonight I watched the 1st part of the two part series : gotta love the < PROPFEMALE > ties . 
I can't see the mountains :-) Snow must be on the way ! Yea ! 
A light dusting of very slick and dangerous snow overnight . Hopefully , we'll get the good stuff after 6 P.M. tonight ! 
My < PROPFIRST > Ministry group had a wonderful tour and talk with the director of Chapel Hill mortuary this evening . 
< PROPMALE > got his shaggy hair and < PROPFEMALE > beard cut today . Woo , he looks like someone I know now . We met < PROPFIRST > for dinner at the < PROPFEMALE > Garden later . 
OMG ! The ice cream truck is out and about today ! It's March , our snowiest month . The fool will get everyone's hopes up that spring is here . 
My refrigerator/freezer stopped working sometime yesterday . There's nothing like opening the freezer to an expanding ButterBraid ! OMG ! The repairman is called and will appear this afternoon sometime . Let's hope for a simple fix . 
SET YOUR CLOCKS FORWARD TONIGHT ! LOSE ONE HOUR'S SLEEP ! YUCK ! 
YES ! My ice maker is working ! Woohoo ! ( I missed cold water today . ) 
YAWN ! The paper didn't arrive until 8 A.M. Hello ?! Someone slept in . 
Just came home from getting < PROPMALE > a new arm rest plate made and having an early supper at Walnut Brewery . Yum ! 
St. < PROPFIRST > members and friends , be sure to sign up for a 12 Question session to help the church as it begins the journey of searching for a new pastor . We need everyone's input . Youth , you are invited to share in the meetings as well . We need your voices for the future ! 
It is St. < PROPFIRST>'s second Lenten dinner and service tonight . Eat at 6 P.M. ; service from 6:45 - 7:30 P.M. Please join us . 
I love the house when it's all clean and shiny :-) 
See , it is still winter . I guess you could call it a Colorado spring : warm weather during the day and snow at night . Then one day : poof , it's summer ! 
Tonight is the third Lenten meal and service at St. < PROPFIRST > . Please join us at 6 P.M. for my momma's chili ( made by me ) and her vegetarian recipe as well ! The service is at 6:45 P.M. 
Wow , < PROPFEMALE > Commonwealth outplayed us this afternoon . I love how K.U. worked their way back from such a deficit , but VCU really did themselves proud . Congratulations from this Jayhawk fan . 
Just returned from a birthday breakfast celebration for < PROPFEMALE > with < PROPMALE > at Benedicts . Happy day , < PROPFEMALE > ! It started out excellently because you were with good friends :-) 
Another dusting of snow this morning to soak into the yards and fields of people on the plains . Yea ! We need this moisture . 
Okay , < PROPFIRST > took off his winter tires today , switching over to regular ones . He's hoping he's correct on his weather predictions . I don't know ... 
< PROPFIRST > and I are facing off with the garage today for its annual \cleaning\ " . I hope we win and not the garage ! "
