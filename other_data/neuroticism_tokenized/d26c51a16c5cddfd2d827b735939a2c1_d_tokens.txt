When < PROPFEMALE > Smith plays chess on her nook color , she cheats . :) 
< PROPFEMALE > Goggin , I know you have a friend that treats you inadequately , and I am sorry for that . But , I feel even more sympathy toward you because you have a friend that is a notorias liar and is too lazy AND STUPID to revise a sentence before posting it .
