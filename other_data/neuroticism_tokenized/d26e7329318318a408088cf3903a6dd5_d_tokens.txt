Went to see Tangled with < PROPFIRST > , it was cute !! 
2010 is almost over !!!! AHHHHH !! Everyone got their new year's resolution ? lol <3 
My mind forgets to remind me , you're a bad idea . You touch me once and it's really something , you find I'm even better than you imagined I would be . I'm on my guard for the rest of the world but with you , I know it's no good . And I could wait paitently but I really wish you would ... drop everything now , meet me in the pouring rain , kiss me on the sidewalk take away the pain , cuz I see sparks fly whenever you smile . 
Oh , I'm scared to see the ending , why are we pretending this is nothing . I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how , I've never heard silence quite this loud . Now I'm standing alone in a crowed room and we're not speaking and I'm dieing to know is it killing you like it's killing me yeah , I don't know what to say since the twist of faith when it all broke down and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now . 
is sick ... but slept for like two hours , feeling somewhat better . 
ARGH !!!!!!! I hate being sick !!!!! 
School or no school , that is the question . How many votes for no school ? 
Is almost done with my soundtrack !!! 
Broke poetry again , too bad there's only one more tournament , but I am going to most definitly kick some butt at Belleville West and get better than sixth place . Go WHS speech team !! We rock !! 
Was kicked out of a Chinese resturant with my best friend < PROPFEMALE > Jones ... 
I love my cat , he thinks he's a ninja cuz he keeps disappearing on me ! 
NOOO !!!! It's the end of speech already ?!?!?!?!?!?!? I cannot believe how much fun I have had and how much I regret not doing it earlier . Honestly , I learned so much ! 
I totally failed the < PROPMALE > final ... wish Frau would just leave me alone and let me read my book in peace !! 
Sonic slushies are the best !!!! yummy !! 
Spent the whole day with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > Busche !! Oh , what fun we can have at Walmart ! 
No school ?? NOOOOOOOOOO !!!!!!!!!!!! No no no no no no , please , I WANT to go to school tomorrow !!! Stupid ice . 
SCHOOL ! SCHOOL ! SCHOOL ! SCHOOL ! PLEASE SCHOOL !! I'M TIRED OF BEING AT HOME !!! 
These days , I haven't been sleeping , staying up playing back myself leaving . When your birthday passed and I didn't call . And I think about summer all the beautiful times I watched you laughing from the passenger side . Realized I loved you in the fall . Then the cold came , the dark days when fear crept into my mind You gave me all your love and all I gave you was \goodbye \"." 
Does not like football ... why should the Superbowl be any different ?
