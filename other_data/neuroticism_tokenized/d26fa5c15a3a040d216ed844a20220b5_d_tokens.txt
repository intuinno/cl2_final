Off to Wonderland Land where never never finds you . For one enchanted night of dreams disguised in swirling light ! 

I . AM . READY . 
Wanna go out and do something , yet do not wanna drive ... gerrr 
Bored as a dog on the sidewalk without a ball , fire hydrant , or mailman in sight . 
Kind of just winging it right now ... still super confused O.o 
Really need a day off to just give me time to think ... 
wishing May 1st never arrives =/ 
have i lost my mudge-ness ? 
You know something is warped in your life when your 5 yr old sister is singing the beginning of Bad Romance ... I definitely have lost my mudge-ness ... 
Go ahead . Yell all you want . It will not ruin this night . =) ( Great work to my cast and crew ! You guys rocked tonight ! ) 
Pants and shorts are getting too big . Now i have to resort to wearing my brothers old stuff(that he didn't even wear ) 
Watermelon ! Nom nom nom ! :) 
Hate those dreams that are so close to reality , but no where near coming true 
I keep hearing \Pure Imagination\ " from < PROPMALE > Wonka on TV ... it just gets my hopes up that the movie is on ... but of course AT&T has to disappoint me =/ " 
Today shall be ... Interesting ... 
\You're so smart ! What am i going to do without you ? \"- NOW my mother decides to appreciate me ?... " 
\You're not sweating . You're lactating ! \"- I would hate to be the guy that was told that " 
\Your lips tremble but your eyes are in a straigt stare . We're on the bed but your clothes are laying right there \"- metro station " 
Time to leave Procrastination Station !!! 
James : \It's like he said : Marvelous things will happen . \ 
Professor Magonagal as a nun ? Great distraction from me being a baby ... 
Life is better when < PROPMALE > on ! 
First \Bad Romance\ " and now \ " Tik Tok\ " ... My sister needs to watch more cartoons and stop listening to the radio ... " 
Watching chem videos and looking at worksheets to try and cram for exam . Sad part is I'm actually learning 
Soooo am i allowed to throw away all my school stuff now ? I feel like i shouldn't but classes are over ... 
I most certainly will not forget the day of unpantsuiting ! 
Wishing my internal clock would set itself a few hours later ... Still need to figure out how to go see Vinny < PROPMALE > ' s show today . =/ 
\So i heard you are going to U of Gay ! \ " ... thanks -.-" 
A spoon full of peanut butter doesn't help the medicine go down . But it sure does make me feel better :) 
Bliss :) 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > clause , and sneaking off to someones house o.O this is what happens when i sleep without blankets ... 
Just noticed they finally posted a release date for StarCraft 2 ! No other word can express my excitement besides ORGASMIC !!! =D 
Just decided on my next photoshop project . Make an avatar ! Ready and up for the challenge ! Well ... Tomorow 
What if the sorting hat rested on someones head and yelled \HOMOSEXUAL ! \ " HAHA oh the things people say :) " 
Just got a new bike !!!! 
My average bed time has changed to like 9:30 . I feel like an old geezer ! 
How is it the longer i sleep , the worse i feel ? 
working on my next photo project . It's going well , all that is left is to put the stuff that will make it special :) 
Okay , i'm done for the night . Made progress in some places , not so much in others * sigh * it's summer and i still want more time ! =/ G'night 
Is it weird that I suddenly wish my name was Balto ? You should all call me that from now on . 
Does anyone have some good album suggestions ? 
Trying to have a conversation w/ my mom in spanish so my sister wouldn't know = FAIL . 
I got a rubber space duckie !!! =D I think I will put it in my next photoshop project ! Starting tonight ! 
I wanna stay like this , forever . If only I could promise , forever . Then we could just be we . Forever you and me . Forever and ever- WTP 
But when the morning comes , and the sun begins to rise . I will lose you , because it's just a dream , When I open up my eyes , I will lose you . \ 
I used to believe in forever , but forever's too good to be true . I've < PROPMALE > a wish on every < PROPFEMALE > , It hasn't done much good so far . I can only dream of you , Wherever you are . - WTP 
So i couldn't give blood this morning(darn permission slips ! ) But i found out i am O positive ! Whatever that means lol 
What are spats ? 
Phineas and Ferb sing songs ? 
So the luck dragon in the never ending story is Falkor , i thought it was Balkior ... That's close right ? 
I just took my laptop apart to fix the charger port because it wouldn't charge . But the reason it wouldn't charge was because it wasn't plugged into the wall ... 
Ya know , I used to not care . But now it seems like theres nothing else for me to think about ... 
The < PROPFEMALE > is whole . The air , filled with a rare life that dances in every breath . And I the simple soul . Wish for nothing but truth . 
My Mom \You look like you haven't slept in days . \ " dang it ! She's catching on ! " 
Dumbledore ? What an old coot ! He's nothing like Rumbleroar ! 
To sleep is to strip oneself of all securities . to dream is to confront your largest obstalce : yourself . Take these risks for a few hours of wonderful peace :) 
Just remembered I still need to finish Gone With the Wind ... hmmm ... do I want to ? 
Come back to bed with me . We'll talk the day away . And before we hold each other close . I'll wisper my dreams and pray you stay ... 
? All alone with nothin to do , don't give a hoot ? Well F . you ! ? =D 
My sleep routine/schedule/habits are soooooooo out of whack !!! T_T 
Kinda finding it a little retarded that FB doesn't notify me of things until HOURS LATER ... 
End now my sleepless night . Let's dream of sand & ocean breeze . And in the clouds we take our flight . To share joy we make with ease ... 
Going out to buy Nine . :) 
Which would you rather do , eat < PROPMALE > or drink from a hose ? I personally choose the hose ... But apparently i am weird ... 
On this pillow rest your head . Think not of woes but dreams instead . Don't worry if it makes no sense . Like Double Rainbow ... so intense . 
Inception . What a movie ! Now time to go to bed and dream ( ... if i'm not dreaming already =P ) 
I feel like there is something that I haven't done in a while , and I really wanna do it ... I just don't know what IT is !!!! 
Money money money ... loans are lame 
So if you combine my Chinese and western zodiac i am the Virgin Monkey ... What are you ? 
So i'm considering taking another class ( a TRAD ) ... Even though it would bring me to 19 credit hours , It would give me a big leg up on my program ... Advice ? 
Let's do the fork in the garbage disposal ! Let's do the fork in the garbage disposal ! 
5 minutes in and i was already entranced ... < PROPFEMALE > Grandin ... I only wish i didn't start at the LAST 5 minutes . I must see this movie . 
Fushigi !!! 
Trying to text and check FB while being in Battle Grounds is NOT working ... I have been once again labeled a Deserter ... NOT COOL ! 
Maybe i will dream of something exciting tonight ... 
Went to a political debate/forum for the super intendent , focused on the arts ... Miss Arizona was there ... Sash , crown and all ... 
My family threw me a suprise grad party ! And here i am in freakin trunks and a large shirt ... FML Haha

You've been F9'ed 
I think i am being haunted by a white V-neck ... 
What is this \CNV HSG : UGrd Application Fee\ " and why is it due now ??? "

Have you ever heard a wolf cry to the blue corn < PROPFEMALE > ? 
Spent my entire 1st First Friday on a street corner w/ a broken guitar being a \starving artists\ " Advocating the Arts ! Now fireworks ! :) "

Let his bones never break and however they try to destroy him , let him never die , let him never die . 
@ < PROPFEMALE > Aquino is awesome . 
I feel like something is suppose to happen today , but I don't know what ... I need to use my planner =/ 
I hate when uncertainty comes knocking . Because by its very nature you never know when or what you will discover when you open the door . 
Falling asleep in my lecture zzzzzz .... 
Haha @ < PROPMALE > Alvarez just jizzed in his pants after watching the latest < PROPMALE > Potter trailer ! It was great ! (the trailer . Not the jizz ... ) 
Can't read my . Can't read my . No he can't read my poker face . - Gaga fills the room 
The sun feels nice today :) 
What is the story about the beautiful young girl who looks like she is always crying ? ( not the mexican folk tale ) 
I didn't think it was possible ... i'm actually EXCITED to write this essay ... even though it is due @ 8 AM tomorrow . :) 
is not happy that the plan for early sleep failed ... I AM happy that I actually finished my first draft ! Thanks < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE > Barnes for letting me work all night in your room , And I am sorry < PROPFIRST > Bornstein that I am going to have to wake you up at 7:30 AM because I have to print this ... twice =/ 
I am so out of it this morning , was walking after class for a minute before I remembered that I rode my bike ... 
I'm soooo cold ! 
Watching < PROPFEMALE > Silverman in < PROPMALE>'s room . This woman is a hoot ! 
Stayed up till 6 watching Funny Girl , was good but LONG ! Now time for breakfast w/ < PROPFIRST > ! ( yay 3 hours of sleep ! :-) ) 
Costume lessons of the day : genies are lame , pirates are awesome , and it's not sexual harassment when he touches our pants . 
A girl brought a \Maltee-Poo\ " (puppy ) to costume lab ! The room has been filled w/ \ " awes ! \ " He's so adorable !!! " 
How come ?

For some reason I'm really missing tangerine altoids right now ... 
Thank you < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > for forcing me to go to sleep . My morning was much better because of it :) ( now it is time to return to said slumber . ) 
Sitting in my room alone in the dark ... playing Robot Unicorn attack ... what has become of me ? 
Sorry , but I will never be able to take the Shake Weight seriously . Just can't . 
Opening night for Dracula ! :-) 
Last night was great ! Glad I could spend my first production w/ such awesome people . Now it's time to drink that first cup of < PROPFEMALE > , smile and go to school =) 
Just got done with Costume Midterm ... now we wait . 
Just found out I got a 50/50 on my acting midterm ! WOOOOOOT !!! That makes me feel better ! =D 
It was a fusion of confusion and a few confounding things . 
Oh college-all-nighter . We meet again ... 
I feel like writing essays would be similar to child birth : no one ever wants to go through it , the longer it takes the worse you feel , and if you don't think it through you're never satisfied with the end result . 
French , Italian , Japanese , or ... Spanish . I wanna pick a foreign language , but not sure what ... ugh ... 
sometimes I don't know why I bother , and then I wake up and feel like I don't need a reason . We just do the things we do because they make us happy , for however long that may be . 
Watching Kiki's Delivery Service with < PROPFEMALE > Aquino in < PROPMALE > Alvarez's room ! FUN SHTUFF ! 
this is the loneliest job eeeeeeevah ! 
Hackeddddddd 
I hate the fact that pre-college I use to be a morning person ... now I'm a \why the heck did I get 8 o'clock classes ?!?! \ " person . " 
Let the black friday madness begin ! 
< PROPMALE > 
The more I listen , and the more I read . The more I am becoming enthralled by Grey Gardens . Great documentary . Great Musical . 
This is the longest time I've ever been in the Study Room at Manzi-Mo ... I DON'T like it =( 
Sill here . still not done . Still wishing for it to end . 
So all I need now is a conclusion . Not sure if I have decided it should be my essay , or some aspect of my life ... 
\Now I'm where I want to be and who I want to be and doing what I always said I would and yet I feel I haven't won at all . \"" 
Am I back ? Or did I leave ? I'll just keep moving so I don't need to wonder if I'm in the right place . 
So spending the day making tamales with my < PROPFEMALE > and dad turned into me sleeping the entire time on their cot . Now it's back home . To do what ? Idk . 
Babysitting .... * sigh * 
Where is my Christmas Cupid ? 
Mall closes at midnight apperently ... should I ? 
Listening to Lady Gaga , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > and Glee while beasting at Halo : Reach , good night ? Yes . 
Working to keep the spirit of christmas alive is hard work ... Can you say , < PROPFEMALE>'s #1 elf ? 
What good is sitting , alone in your room ? Come hear the music play ! Life is a cabaret old chum ! Come to the Cabaret ! 
And ofcourse right before christmas we watch mass from the vatican :) 
Menudoooooooo ! :-) 
walking into my house @ 7 in the morning after a nonstop night of adventure ... My life sure is different :-) 
Getting ready to spend the evening with the bro & and step-bro's ... Yay ?

So tomorrow : Tucson , Wicked , Manzi-Men , Home , DENNY'S! This year has been great since Day 1 ! 
Raulie ... I guess that is kind of an odd name huh ? 
All 3 Rauls on our way to Tucson ! 
Yesterday was a blast ! So much stuff went on ! Wicked Q&A ! Got to spend the day with some manzi-men ! And I had a dream I worked at Buffalo Exchange thanks to < PROPFEMALE > Creager and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > ! =D 
I'm tired of this happening . That's it . This semester I'm taking more risks . I'm not getting played . 
Today was a blast ! Started with a healthy serving of delicious doughnuts made by < PROPMALE > Barnes . Then went and watched some < PROPMALE > Potter with < PROPFEMALE > Andaya < PROPFEMALE > Pattison & < PROPFEMALE > Monarrez ! However , now I am tired , somewhat confused , and am ready to hit the hay . 
So I proposed to < PROPFIRST > V . Over a mointain top , the crowed below w/ her looked expectingly for a yes ... She said no ... 
So now I am a < PROPFIRST > ? My entire life has been a lie ... 
I'm done ! 
Kind of sick of < PROPFEMALE > taking BBC shows and making < PROPFEMALE > n versions , just saw an advertisement for Being Human set in < PROPFEMALE > . Come on the US , we can come up with something good on our own ! 
This is driving me crazy ! I hate feeling like I messed up . 
Just got back from a great workout with Colter Ogden ! Feeling good about getting fit ! 
I hate when I feel like i'm not getting any where with something 
Sooooo < PROPFEMALE > from Mighty Morphing Power Rangers . Boy or girl ? Discuss .

Had a horrible nightmare ... :'( 
No phone . Life sucks . 
Hmmmmmmm ...... 
In this wondered state I share the secrete of this date forever not one hopes of late but hidden grasps on hands of fate 
* groggle groggle groggle * 
Facing mixed emotional sleepage ... 
Sometimes I question . 
Let work begin . 
Finally back in my nice cozy dorm 
Ugh ... My eyes hurt ... 
Insomnia ! Half tempted to just go walk around campus ... 
So I am stating the obvious by letting you know it's freezing cold ... Atleast it will be warm at stress rehearsal . 
Too much coffee makes Raulie feel ill ... 
Mi non piace come sei non può capire . Cosi voglio tu provare . 
The thing about dreams is if you don't hold on to them quick , they slip away ... 
Chorizo burrito and Italian HW ... lets do this 
No ! I STILL do not want you wispering sweet poetry in my ear !!! T_T I dislike creepers ... 
Waiting for the last minute to do Design Project is definitely causing me sadness ... yay all nighters !!!! 
2 characters down ... 2 to go ... 
I am done ! All that is left is to print ... which might be difficult =/ 
So my lack of a plan of attack has left me laying on my floor ... 
I have dinopark tycoon for my laptop ... my Italian Homework is not pleased ... but I am :) 
Hmm , mystical Elizabethan ballroom w/ creepy chorus , or galactic rave w/ engineered hottie ? Oh the things music makes me invision ...

Are you using a Stupefy spell or are you just naturally stunning ? 
Soooooooo tired ! There's no place like home . There's no place like home ... 
Ho bisogno cessare . 
When nightmares step out of their shadows and through the thin vail that are dreams . They hide amongst us . In our reflection . 
Dorm days

I feel the cosmos are playing some sick game on me ... 
Cirque Du Soleil : What a gay Frenchman sees when he is tired and horny .

You know technology has ruined you when a stranger looks at you and speaks but you ignore them b/c you think they are on a bluetooth ... 
Can it all just slow down ? 
How anyone can sleep more then 8 hours a night is beyond me , but < PROPFIRST > Bornstein , you have proven me wrong . Thanks roomie ! 
< PROPMALE > Barnes is awkwardly tonguing orange jell-o while I am trying to do work ... 
PODS ... you are going to kill me ... 
Back to bed . Run along . Let's go . 
Can I like the life I'm living ? \ 
Can I live the life I like ? \

But mess around with < PROPMALE > ? 
In the cage with < PROPFIRST > Abbott < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > & Gobo Ramakesavan !!!!! LIFE BE GOOOD !!!!

I don't feel so good ... 
Kinda wanna watch Legend of A Seeker , mainly for one reason , and one reason alone . 
Either my laptop was steaming or smoking ... Both of which are NOT GOOD ! 
For some reason I thought today was St. < PROPFIRST>'s Day , and I was wondering why no one has said anything ... It was only when I saw Google's logo was the same that I knew ...
