the love of my life called after one whole year of no contact . you can imagine the size of my smile at that moment ... 
curious as to what is going to happen in the oncoming days ... 
not wanting to give up on someone that i should have long ago ... 
taking life as it comes ...

school just started and the exhaustion is already kicking in ... 
last nights game : yanks 20 , boston 6 .. i love it . what is ny to do tonight ?? my weekend is to consist of pool , baseball , and homework . MR . HALE IS THE SHIZZ !! 
a mind full of success and mess that is to be put down on paper in one way or another ... 
doing homework within a room of burning candles and lit incense . now that is a way to take on suncoast assignments in a stress free environment . not to mention , it smells absolutely delicious in here ... =] 
bring on the weekend .... anything exciting going down ? 
and so the skies turned grey and it poured away ... however it eventually cleared and the sky was beautiful and literally the limit . 
the weekend : homework , sunshine , a much needed visit with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > , sunshine and more homework ... 
what once was a minor epiphany , is now a new radiant revelation ... 
some people are put on this planet for a particular purpose ... 
high on homework .. 
thank god it's friday with a three day weekend . i can't stand mrs. dougherty ; my biggest pet-peeve are people who underestimate me .

ready for the lonnnnnggg weekend =] 
todays lesson learned : people are going to judge one another no matter where you are ; there is never going to be that perfect world where everyone will accept and get along with everyone . after all this time of putting people before myself , i now have realized that it is not selfish to put myself first . from this day forward , what will only matter to me is MY well-being , no one elses ... 
no senior skip day for me seeing as swine took over my week last week ... 
anything going down during this loonnnggg weekend ? hit it up ...

feels like dying . if anyone can bring me tea with < PROPFEMALE > or some type of soup i would love them forever .... 
sick of being sick - show me the love :) 
ohhh nausea please go away .... weekend please COME NOW !! 
love was a promise made of smoke in a frozen copse of trees ; a bone cold and older than our bodies slowly floating in the sea - like a snake within the wilted garden wall , i’d hint to her every possibility ; while with his gun the pagan angel < PROPFEMALE > to say \my love is one made to break every bended knee \"" 
my friday night was grrrrreattt ;) 
thrifting always puts me in a better mood :) 
grrrreaaatttt night round 2 ;) 
ohhh sunday .... a day for cleaning , the doing of school work , and unfortunately the reminder of how much i hate mondays .... the weekend however ? grrrrand ;] 
a rough morning for starters ; still out of it from the weekend . in need of an internal wake up call that will set me back on my proper trackkk .... ughhblahhh :) 
I <3 family :) 
artistically productive :) 
, you are biking with the wind behind you which gives you extra smooth power that effortlessly eats up the < PROPMALE > . keep up the pace without straining so when it's time to take a rest or the wind changes , you'll have the accomplishment you need under your belt . sustain without strain for the greatest gain <3 
sooo unbelievably exhausted from an interesting ( yet amazing ) tuesday night that resulted in one hour of sleep . definitelyyyy catching up with that this evening - college is outrageous :) 
an interesting day and a great night once again . i love it . ;) 
supa sleepyyyy zZzZzZz 
jam session whilst doing work for college comp - tis the way to go ;) 
celebrating the long weekend a lil early ;) 
so i can now officially say that i have been to acadia national park :] here's to the start of what's to be a fantastic fall break ;] 
hanging and foliage hunting with < PROPFEMALE > . unity is currently a ghost town - i miss many people .... 
making dream catchers and jammin ' to pandora . i miss everybody ! COME BACK ! 
jams all day that she jams in her sleep <3 
catching up with work today , paddling out on flagstaff lake tomorrow :) 
“autumn is a second spring where every leaf is a flower” 
flagstaff lake - see you all on tuesday ;) LIVE THE LIFE YOU LOVE , LOVE THE LIFE YOU LIIIIVVVVEEE 
absolutely amazing trip - loving all these opportunities ! very happy that it was < PROPFEMALE > and the water had a chop ; hiking a mountain is something i've always wanted to do and experience . unity <3 
jammin in my sleep before oral communications ;) 
two of my classes have been canceled , which means i now only have one today ! happy friday ! yayyyy :D 
another phenomenal friday evening :] wondrous weekends all around ! 
a decent but dull day - dreadful would describe tomorrow ... ( ohhh sundayysss ) 
a beautiful < PROPFEMALE > day in unity , maine :) 
just got back from collecting foliage for craft now waiting on the last load of laundry . then off to < PROPFIRST>'s for some groceries :) 
the usual ; a great day spent with good people . now it's time to get some work done and look forward to tomorrow's fun ;) 
bio at 10 then writer's circle meet at 1 :] 
watching hocus pocus - i love halloween time :) 
in a good place but not in a good place ... 
Friday's always make me feel fantastic in the end ; no matter what ... 
“no matter how dark things seem to be or actually are , raise your sights and see the possibilities – always see them , for they're always there”\ 
\ 
“life isn't about waiting for the storm to pass ; it's about learning to dance in the rain” 
alright , don't worry , we'll all float on .... 
IT'S SNOWING !!!! 
spending sunday night with slightly stoopid should bring a mellow monday morning ;) 
a day to catch up on all sorts of work and next semester's course selection . the weather prediction better be accurate as the excessive frost on the ground continues to glisten in hopes for snowfall ;) 
the morning of preregistration .... ahhhhhhhh !!!! 
received all of my required courses for next semester ! yayyyyyyyyyyyyyy 
JAMMIN ' OUTTTT ;] 
The Brew was awesome ! Another great Saturday night in Unity , Maine :) 
research papers blowwwww 
a very non hectic day ... i've been looking forward to one of those !! 
\if i could be the sun \ 
this week is going to be hell - just saying ...... 
jammin ' out while pulling mad work out of my ass .... gotta love college at its most chaotic moments . this week was hell - just saying ..... ;] 
headed to new york tomorrow to finally see the poppa bear :) then i'll be off to new jersey for a few days then on to connecticut .... HERE'S TO WHAT'S TO BE AN AWESOME THANKGIVING BREAK ! have fun my fellow unity people , i'll miss you all terribly :D 
call me lame , but i totally wanna see Love & Other Drugs ... 
i'm off ! first stop , new york ! i hope everyone has a blast and a happy thanksgiving !! talk to you all soon ! 
spending time in ny with dad in my uncle's bachelor pad is really rad ..... ;) 
the gypsies are onto jersey ... ;) 
hanging around the garden state . wednesday should be wild =) 
ALL MY COLLEGE WORK IS DONE .... FREEEEDOOOMMMMM !!!!! 
an astounding day . curious for tomorrow's surprises ! 
off to < PROPMALE > lakes , new jersey then i'll once again be a fool for the city - taking the E subway train to ground zero ! pictures will most definitely be taken !! ahhh !!!! 
new york city was outrageous ! i'm glad to be back at the bachelor pad though .... off to connecticut tomorrow ! 
happy thanksgiving everyone :) i am thankful for unity college , all my friends there that i now consider family , and LIFE !! ONE LOVEEEE 
missing Unity ... see you Sunday ;] 
ahhhh Unity ..... my most favorite of my many homes ; glad to be back ! 
so i'm pretty much convinced that college life kicks ass .... ;] 
this weekend is gonna be siiiiiiiiiickkkkkk 
this weekend was redic ! i look forward to next weekend ! my friends at unity are the shiiiiitttttttt 
i'll wait , i'll never give in ; our love has got the power . too many lovers in one lifetime ain't good for you . you treat me like a vision in the night , someone there to stand behind you when your world ain't working right . i ain't no vision , i'm the girl who loves you inside and out , backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out . i love no other way . what are we gonna do if we lose that fire ? 
girls are like apples on trees ; best ones at the top . boys don't want 2 reach 4 the good ones because they're afraid of falling . they just get the rotten apples off the ground that aren't as good but easy . so apples at the top think there's something wrong with them when in reality they're amazing . they just have 2 wait 4 the right boy 2 come along , the one who's brave enough 2 climb all the way 2 the top of the tree 
everyone come out to the sac at 8pm tonight to hear some of my thoughts .... ;) 
here's to the weekend ! currently in a great place and going to be in a great place all weekendddd !!! 
\by the way 
the final weekend before winter break in unity was full of wonder . i'm pretty excited to see the sunshine state though :) 
guys need to realize : it should never be about appearance . if persona , personality , and similarity are present , then the shit's < PROPFEMALE > ... 
\man is the only animal for whom his own existence is a problem which he has to solve” " 
absolutely one of the most chaotic and hectic days of my college career .... ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh i need some relaxation . < PROPFEMALE > RIDA HERE I COME ! 
classes are done , exams are done , now it's time to have funnnnnnnnnnn :) 
a great last night in unity . it really made me realize that the friendships i have formed here are forever . i will miss everyone beyond belief . ONEEE LOVEEE

the best present i could have ever received was my education , my family , and my life at Unity College :) 
“i seldom end up where i wanted to go , but almost always end up where i need to be”

and if i knew it'd end like this , i never would have kissed you cause i fell in love with you . we never would have kicked it ; that's why i wish we never did it and i wish we never loved it . and i wish i never fell so deep in love with you and now there ain't no way we can be friends ... and all i can say now is fuck you , man . 
beach with the pals today ..... riiight on riiight on :) 
whipping through the waves and diving under their curls felt delicious . digging my toes into the sand sent warm sensations throughout my body . smelling the ocean breeze reminded me of 561 memories . florida , as much as i can't stand the state , it was nice to be back for winter break . < PROPFIRST > Mcmenamin , you are forever a treasure . maine , just four more days till our next endeavor !!!!

shadiness is never cool in my book ... 
people piss me off . honestly at this point in time , i much rather live my life in solitude . fuck everyone , seriously ... 
hey i , ohhh i'm still alive\ 
hey i , but , i'm still alive\ 
yeah i , ohhh i'm still alive\ 
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeahhhhhh 
i am distinct , after me my kind's extinct\ 
indeed , i am what i am and it's all that i am\ 
and if i can't pursue dreams , nobody can\ 
i am here , thinking clear , won't disappear\ 
never shall i ever focus on fear\ 
seeing straight , my sights and i just set a date\ 
something i nor anyone can underestimate and contemplate 
the world will never know 
i'm so tired ... i feel like i can sleep for three days straight .... zZzZzZzZzZz 
\it's an < PROPMALE > to live with pain .. mix the light into gray \""

today was a busy but successful day on so many levels ... i can feel it :] 
“the way you get meaning into your life is to devote yourself to loving others , devote yourself to your community around you , and devote yourself to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning\ " , 2011-02-10 14:38:49 " 
it is what it is .... riight onn riight onn ;)

WITH LOVE & < PROPFEMALE > YOU CAN CONQUER <3 
and yet another year without a valentine .... CHEERS !!! <3 
i know i'm beautiful inside and out\ 
and if anyone has any doubt\ 
it means they're crazy\ 
not me 
this week needs to be over ... 
slow dancing in a burning room .... 
in need of a hug and a lil more love 
born under a bad sign . i've been down since i began to crawl . if it wasn't for bad luck , i wouldn't have no luck at all . bad luck and trouble's my only friend . i've been down ever since I was ten . you know , wine and men is all i crave . a big bad man's gonna < PROPFEMALE > me to my grave ... 
last night was wild . i love hearing the truth that comes out of the wasted . i admire the realization that i truly am too good for anyone out there . thank you aa ; i'll always have you're back <3 
my dreams and aspirations are going nowhere no matter who's cutting in 
rock on , live on , love on , riiiight onnnn ;] 
where did all the good people go ? 
to hell with this . i shall follow the footsteps of < PROPFIRST > mccandless and move to alaska and live in the wilderness ; without a degree and away from this sad excuse of a society . sounds good to me ... peace out . 
there are good people in this world ; they're just hard to come by . but i sure am glad that i was born one of them :) 
taking life as it comes is the way to go rather than just let it go 
\the time to hesitate is through \"" 
\there is just one life for each of us : our own \"" 
just by jammin ' i can reach oblivion ; who says you have to drink to get there ? 
working till 10 ... oh joy ... 
WOULD ANYONE BE WILLING TO GIVE ME A RIDE TO BANGOR AIRPORT ON SATURDAY AROUND NOON ? I'D PITCH IN FOR GAS AND WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE IT . THANKSSSSSSSSSS 
is it friday yet ? 
some people need to go back to high school to hold their grudges , talk their smack , and be bad people . Unity is not your place if you rather step on the ones you know rather than toss an arm around them . grow up , get out , or go back to grade 9 ... 
today's one hell of a day ; can't wait for it to be over\ 
spring break , florida , i'm ready for ya ... 
got it all figured out . i'm eventually to be an arts & environments < PROPMALE > , with a minor in zoology . unity i am going no where , here is where i am , and here is where i'm staying ;) 
howling with the wolves soon - Loki Clan Wolf Refuge , hope you accept me into your pack ... <3 
here i come < PROPFEMALE > RIDAAAAA ;) 
exhausted after a long day of traveling , but i'm glad to be back home for a while :) 
watching into the wild .... surprise surprise ... teheeee :) 
first full day in florida and it rained ; it's soothing though - jammin ' out with the coolest dog in the world :) Remedy <3 
traipsing through the nature reserve today with the camera on my shoulder and the dog at my side 
\and oh how she prays to find a man to blame\ 
just got back from fishing ; now enjoying the evening with my mother and some Goodfellas ;) 
anyone feel like picking me up from bangor airport at 10:30 pm on saturday , march 19 ? i'll give you gas money and a big hug ! :) 
love and best wishes sent to japan , and all whom will be affected by the tsunami in hawaii and the u.s west coast <3 
\stick to those who praise what is good and seek out what is beautiful \"" 
just got back from wandering the trails with the pup . it's beautiful here today :) 
i miss the unit <3 
is kicking ass in scrabble right now 
ohhh florida how you are not one of favor . i'm ready to return , maine , as you are my savior 
no horror movie will ever top the original exorcist of 1973 - just saying ... 
sweet emotion ;] 
my dog is not my whole life but indeed he makes my life whole . \ 
out wandering the woods with Remedy one last time before i return to maine . i can honestly say that he is the one thing i miss most whenever i'm not home . he truly is the one thing that has been by my side through thick and thin and 100% . \ 
i <3 my < PROPFEMALE > retriever , i <3 my living remedy 
a beautiful day in every way <3 
getting up early tomorrow and heading to the beach to watch the sun rise - should be epic :) 
MAINE IN PRECISELY 20 SUM HOURS .... STOKEDDDDD ;D 
making my dog a collar out of hemp , packing , and spending the last few hours with < PROPFEMALE > Snyder , < PROPFIRST > Snyder , and Heather-Jade Snyder . missing < PROPFIRST > Snyder ... <3 
one last jam session within the florida sunshine then off to the airport . I CAN\T WAIT TO SEE THE UNITY FAMILY ! "

too deep for any man 
awesome day . Unity <3 
SNOW DAY ON A FRIDAY ? RIGHT ON , MAN !!!! 
you cannot hide from your shadow ; you cannot hide from what's there . so accept and admire the one thing that indeed does follow you everywhere ... 
cannot help but be drawn to a man to which \everything comes naturally \"< 3 " 
groovin ' because she's groovy ;] 
got all my courses for next semester but one . it's okay though because i got into documentary film and environmental writing ! national geographic here i come !!!!! 
wandered the woods with people of wonder and whit - gregariously great ! now time for some productivity towards a psychology paper ... (; 
happy that my photographs made it into the unity mag ! siiiick ! 
going for a bike ride to clear my head ... 
give me one more < PROPMALE > to show u that i care for u . let me show u , boy , \ 
that i know wrong from right - that every street u walk on i leave tear stains on the ground . in ur head , zombie , zombie , zombie . hey , hey , what's in ur head , in ur head ; zombie , zombie , zombie ? can i talk to u ? comfort u ? let u know i care for u ? hold on , stay strong , press on ( for me baby ) - i care for u ( i care for u , u , u ) 
honestly feels just like crawling into a hole ... 
every day is a winding road ...

\is all my dreaming at an end ? \ 
to put it bluntly , fuck it ... 
i know who i am and i am all that i am . i have a one of a kind mind & a big <3 ; in time u'll realize u tore an awesome friendship apart . i've acknowledged my wrong & tried 2 make things better , but u continue 2 hold a grudge & not say one letter . what happened 2 that cool , mature person ? must've gone 2 live life - the video game version . but man , this is reality , i hope u can return & bring our bond back 2 normality 
jammin ' hard to some indie undergrounds - writing and sketching a bit ; perhaps a nap ? 
tonight i'll be jammin ' with Heads in the Clouds .... stokeddd 
bike ride in the rain ? absolutely . 
the final days as a freshman in college have come - can't believe it . unity , aside from all the unexpected dramatics , you're a great and beautiful place that i show pride in being a part of . but now , a new chapter is ahead ; an endeavor that may change my life forever . on that note , i hope everyone has a great summer , and returns with a friendly and fresh frame of mind . ~ PEACE . LOVE . HAPPINESS ~ 
oh how i can't wait for exams to pass , wednesday to come , and really last . 
glad it's all over ; i'm leaving tomorrow for the wolf pack - time to get crunk with < PROPFEMALE > lada and company ;) see ya soon pop <3
