whoever is going to text me , my phone is being gay so i cant talk to anyone :/ so i will text whoever wants me to when i get it fixed , get a new one , or get an upgrade ! 
hating is just loving in a bad way . 
like me for me , not for what i look like or for who i used to be . 
Distance means so little when someone means so much . 
Age is just a number , but love is unmeasurable . 
Learning to be who i am as a whole , not just pieces . It's hard to be yourself when you haven't been accepted most of your life . 
I know you want it to happen , and you know I want it to happen , hopefully what we want will come true sooner than we know . 
* sigh * just another day ... another fucking awesome day (: been an awesome sauce weekend !! 
And soon you learn , that the only thing worth to treasure , are the people that actually cared . Forever , my heart will always beat your name . <3 
yay . 
Do you feel it ? My heart is pounding so fast . Here , put your head on my chest and listen . 
Death must be easy cuz life is hard . 
Your mom is on my mind ! 
Live life like how you want to live it , not how they want you to live it .

Senda message to my inbox telling me something you've always wanted to say , it stays between us , I promise ;) put this as your status and see whatyou get ! 
Hit me , spit on me , yell at me , do whatever you want with me ; it will never hurt as much as watching her walk away .

All the suspense\ 
That we've created\ 
Now it's wasted\ 
And we can't change it\ 
The beginning to the ending\ 
I find myself remembering\ 
\ 
How quickly lust can pretend it's love\ 
Designing words to help us believe\ 
It's so much more than just tonight\
