our touch , your ways\ 
Leave me dumb without reason\ 
Your love , my cage\ 
My prison so pleasing\ 
I spend my days\ 
... Tangled in thoughts of you\ 
Stuck in this place\ 
Resigned to be your fool\ 
\ 
I thirst no longer\ 
Drenching my soul\ 
Pour out like water\ 
You're my only infatuation\ 
Don't leave me stranded\ 
In my obsession\ 
My purpose , my possession\ 
Live and die in my obsession\ 
My obsession 
I hate feeling like this\ 
I'm so tired of trying to fight this\ 
I'm asleep and all I dream of\ 
Is waking to you\ 
Tell me that you will listen\ 
Your touch is what I'm missing\ 
And the more I hide I realize\ 
I'm slowly losing you\ 
Comatose\ 
I'll never wake up without an overdose of you\ 
I don't wanna live , I don't wanna breathe\ 
' Less I feel you next to me\ 
You take the pain I feel\ 
( Waking up to you never felt so real ) 
well there goes my career with wal-mart !!! 
< PROPFIRST > 1:2 -3 My brethren count it all joy when you fall into various trials . Knowing that the testing of your faith produces < PROPFEMALE > but let < PROPFEMALE > have its perfect work that you may be perfect and complete , lacking nothing . It's all up to him and his perfect plan for my life now . I will trust in you my lord and do whatever it is that you ask of me to do . And remember no matter what , God is still God !

\Despite the lies that you're making 
needs some neighbors for espnu college town !!! 
\All this time 
I'd catch a grenade for ya \ 
Throw my hand on a blade for ya \ 
I'd jump in front of a train for ya \ 
You know I'd do anything for ya \ 
Oh , oh , I would go through all of this pain , \ 
Take a bullet straight through my brain ! \ 
Yes , I would die for ya 
Your touch , your ways\ 
I spend my daysTangled in thoughts of you\ 
Resigned to be your fool 
Scene of complacency , an apathetic mind \ 
But when it's brought to light , I see a < PROPMALE > on a borrowed throne \ 
Right now , the violence ta < PROPMALE > over \ 
This time , regimes are changing in my mind \ 
I'm so sorry , my old friend , I'm leaving you tonight \ 
So caught in this moment , the last breath of your life\ 
Regime Change by Disciple\ 
I love this band , its an awesome song ! 
its 330 am . . . . and who's still awake ? This guy !! guess ill do some laundry and watch a movie ! 
What's the point ? 
Looking for an easy way out , someone to blame\ 
Why does it work this way , still today ? \ 
You wanna take somebody down along the way ? \ 
But I won't let that one be me , ' cause I don't want the drama it brings\ 
See , today isn't \back in the day\ " anymore\ 
Despite the lies that you're making\ 
Your love is mine for the taking\ 
My love is just waiting\ 
To turn your tears to roses\ 
I will be the one that's gonna hold you\ 
I will be the one that you run to\ 
My love is a burning , consuming fire\ 
No , you'll never be alone\ 
When darkness comes\ 
I'll light the night with stars\ 
Hear my whispers in the dark 
What would it take to make you see me\ 
The way that I see you ? \ 
And what would it take to make you want me\ 
The way I've always wanted you ? \ 
I don't know why You're in everything I see\ 
And I can't deny that You're everything I need\ 
So I reach in\ 
Whatever it takes to get to You\ 
Whatever it takes to break through\ 
Whatever it takes You are my reason\ 
For everything I do 
< PROPMALE > is a dominator and I bow to him 
is wishing he didn't have to work tonite so he could watch the jayhawks destroy colorado state ! oh well , thats why they invented dvr !! 
Be the change that u want to see in the world . \ 
Ghandi 
I'm at war with the world\ 
And they try to pull me into the dark\ 
I struggle to find my faith\ 
As I'm slipping from your arms\ 
It's getting harder to stay awake\ 
And my strength is fading fast\ 
You breathe into me at last\ 
I'm awake , I'm alive\ 
Now I know what I believe inside\ 
Now it's my time\ 
I'll do what I want ' cause this is my life 
When we look around and we don't know what to say\ 
How did we lose our way ? I don't know if we'll ever really see a change\ 
If this is how we show our thanks , I think it's time we rearrange\ 
I don't know if we'll ever really break away\ 
We've been holding on for so long now , I think we're scared to run away\ 
I don't know if we ever really learned to pray\ 
So , I drop down to my knees\ 
And I cry out , Can You help me , please 
The secret side of me , I never let you see\ 
I keep it caged but I can't control it\ 
So stay away from me , the beast is ugly\ 
I feel the rage and I just can't hold it\ 
It's scratching on the walls , in the closet , in the halls\ 
It comes awake and I can't control it\ 
Hiding under the bed , in my body , in my head\ 
Why won't somebody come and save me from this , make it end ? 
So , you think you can see inside my mind ? \ 
You probably could if you just took a little time \ 
I know exactly what you're trying to say\ 
But sitting in the stands ain't the same as playing the game\ 
So , I can't comprehend in my mind\ 
Just why we can't leave it all behind \ 
So , come on and stand beside , and hold the line \ 
' Cause tonight is the night we cry \ 
oh\ 
You can't bring me down 
We drive on and don't look back\ 
It doesn't mean we can't learn from our past\ 
All the things that we might've done wrong\ 
We could've been doing this all along\ 
Everybody with your fists raised high\ 
Let me hear your battle cry tonight\ 
Stand beside or step aside\ 
We're on the front line 
three down one to go ! SPED FINAL AT 330 !! 
I love working at walmart so much ! Makes me want to quit school and work here the rest of my life ! NOT !! This place is a joke ! 
Arriving at gma's! Been a couple years since I've been here for winter activities ! 
i believe the royals have some of the dumbest gm's there are . why trade one of your best pitchers away ? Stupid ! They are gonna continue to suck ! Thanx a lot ! 
Got my new phone and setting it up !! 
Take me past the outer courts\ 
Into the Holy Place\ 
Past the brazen altar\ 
Lord I want to see your face\ 
Pass me by the crowds of people\ 
And the Priests who sing your praise\ 
I hunger and thirst for your righteousness\ 
But it's only found in one place\ 
Take me into the holy of holies\ 
Take me in by the blood of the lamb\ 
Take the coal , touch my lips , here I am\ 
Kutless \Take Me In \"" 
Tangled in thoughts of you\ 
Say what you want to say about me\ 
Throw up what you want to throw up at me\ 
But when you mess with those that are around me\ 
That's when you and I will have a problem 
Death until the dust , and we're waiting\ 
Ruined in the rust , of our craving\ 
It feels like , it feels like\ 
Don't you know the cost , of your betrayal ? \ 
You're the one that's lost , you're gonna fail\ 
It feels like , like you're gasping with all your might\ 
You can't take away my strength\ 
Fix these broken veins\ 
You can't take away my pride , I won't be denied\ 
There's nothing left to fight ( Live free or let me die ) 
' m just a step away\ 
I'm just a breath away\ 
Losing my faith today\ 
Falling off the edge today\ 
I am just a man\ 
Not superhuman\ 
I'm not superhuman\ 
Someone save me from the hate\ 
It's just another war\ 
Just another family torn\ 
Falling from my faith today\ 
Just a step from the edge\ 
Just another day in the world we live\ 
I need a hero to save me now 
Wish I was as cool as < PROPFEMALE > !!! 
I bow down to < PROPFEMALE > and Malarie !!! 
I bow down to < PROPFEMALE>'s awesomeness !!! And im jealous of her !!! 
And this is how it feels when I ignore the words you spoke to me\ 
And this is where I lose myself when I keep running away from you\ 
And this is who I am when , when I don't know myself anymore\ 
And this is what I choose when it's all left up to me\ 
Breathe your life into me , I can feel you\ 
I'm falling , falling faster\ 
Breathe your life into me , I still need you\ 
I'm falling , falling\ 
Breathe into me\ 
Breathe into me 
don't know what to do . im bored . 
A long day alone , emptiness is so real\ 
Never having peace of mind\ 
Running from what I can't sing\ 
And there is nowhere left to hide\ 
Turn and face these empty lies\ 
All alone , heart unturned , trying to find\ 
Break me down , replace this fear inside\ 
Take this nothingness from me\ 
I want to fight , I want to shine\ 
I want to rise , break me down 
Highlight of the night : going in the ditch on my way home from work ! Awesome !! 
I lie here paralytic , inside this soul\ 
Screaming for you till my throat is numb\ 
I wanna break out I need a way out\ 
I don't believe that it's gotta be this way\ 
The worst is the waiting\ 
In this womb I'm suffocating\ 
Tell me when I'm gonna live again\ 
Tell me when I'm gonna breathe you in\ 
Tell me when I'm gonna feel inside\ 
Tell me when I'm gonna feel alive 
You can't take away my pride , I wont be denied ! \ 
live free or let me die ! 
I don't wanna feel like this tomorrow\ 
I don't wanna live like this today\ 
Make me feel better , I wanna feel better\ 
Stay with me here now and never surrender\ 
Never surrender\ 
Put me back together\ 
Never surrender , make me feel better\ 
You make me feel better\ 
Stay with me here now and never surrender 
Y hello school alarm ! how i've missed hearing you go off ! no not really ?

Theres a hole in my heart thats bleeding\ 
But its given me strength I needed\ 
To < PROPFEMALE > on\ 
I'm moving on\ 
I'm not giving up that easily\ 
I can see the black cloud breaking\ 
But it doesnt stop the scars from aching\ 
I'm standing strong , it won't be long\ 
Til I see you face to face\ 
I'm not going down that easy\ 
It takes more than that just to break me\ 
I'm not going down without bleeding\ 
I'm not going down down without a fight 
The last night you'll spend alone\ 
I'll wrap you in my arms and I won't let go\ 
I'm everything you need me to be 
As time went on , I opened up my eyes\ 
You never really knew me\ 
You don’t know what’s deep inside\ 
Just so you know , I’ll never be like you\ 
I’ll take what God has made me\ 
I’m not an empty shell\ 
And I hope that you see\ 
Instead of following\ 
I’m finally awake\ 
I feel alive today\ 
I feel everything\ 
It’s all so clear to me 
I'm so sick of when they say\ 
It's just a phase , you'll be okay , you're fine\ 
But I know it's a lie\ 
This is the last night you'll spend alone\ 
Look me in the eyes so I know you know\ 
I'm everywhere you want me to be\ 
I'm everything you need me to be\ 
The last night away from me 
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain\ 
Holy , holy is He\ 
Sing a new song to Him who sits on\ 
Heaven's mercy seat\ 
Holy , holy , holy is the Lord God Almighty\ 
Who was and is and is to come\ 
With all creation I sing praise to the < PROPMALE > of kings\ 
You are my everything and I will adore You\ 
Filled with wonder awestruck wonder\ 
At the mention of Your name\ 
Jesus Your name is power , breath and living water\ 
Such a marvelous mystery

If you don't like it , get behind me and leave me alone ! \

Throw up what you want to throw up at me \ 
But when you mess with those that are around me \ 
i played bball this morning for the first time in a year . my shots were ugly but the running was good exercise . i think i probably fouled < PROPMALE > about 15 times . lol 
When the lights go up and the game is on \ 
Are you ready for me ? ' Cause I'm ready for you \ 
I honestly want peace with you \ 
But when you come against my country \ 
When you come against my family \ 
You try to destroy my people \ 
I can't just stand by \ 
I am coming , and if I come , then pain is coming with me \ 
I'm coming , and pain will be with me\ 
Game On By Disciple

I don't know how I could live without Malarie and < PROPFEMALE > 
My eyes have adjusted to dark and so is my heart\ 
The weight of the world has covered me\ 
I'm in over my head\ 
Am I living or dead\ 
Can anyone hear me calling out\ 
I'm calling out\ 
Finally breaking so where are you now\ 
It's been such a long time\ 
But I've tried to live without\

So reach down and pull me up\ 
Pull me up before I am buried beneath

No one will try\ 
All my friends think that I'm gone\ 
But I swear , I swear I'm not 
why hello mr. bed ! You are oh so nice , but I think its time for an ugrade !!! 
Theres nothing you say that could ever fade me\ 
Serving up another lesson learned\ 
There's nothing you say that could ever change me\ 
Toe to toe and pound for pound \ 
Step right up its time to throw down\ 
The cage awaits this moment\ 
The tension pushes through \ 
The stage is set to showdown\ 
Im not turning my back on you\ 
Face to face with the enemy\ 
Giving in to you I refuse\ 
Somebody's gotta win\ 
And I don't know how to lose

When you don't wanna wake up\ 
Everything is #$%^@#\ 
Everybody sux\ 
You don't really know why\ 
But you want justify\ 
Rippin ' someone's head off\ 
No human contact\
