I was blamed by my half brother of starting my parents argument , which is untrue , uncalled for , and disrespectful . 
Baby , No matter what Bendan said you didn't start the argument between your mother and dad . He doesn't know what he is talking about or he is trying to protect the guilty party . I will always love you . Dad .
