I want to dye my hair red . But I don't know how and I don't think I'd be brave enough to try ... 

So excited about the midnight premiere of The Last Airbender ! I hope it's not as bad as the fans say it will be , at least . 
never thought M . Night Shyamalan could create that which Unbreakable could not redeem . Was horrifyingly wrong . 
wants an aviator hat and goggles . 
is now at college . 
is back at college after a quick trip home . 
is wondering whether participating in NaNoWriMo is even remotely feasible this year . 
will share a random thought in an ongoing effort to become less inhibited : I wish pita chips didn't create so many crumbs . Otherwise I would eat them in bed like a hipster fat kid . 
My only class of the day got cancelled . Now I have to decide whether to study Japanese or write my < PROPMALE > Lear paper . Because I am so not focused enough to do both . 
Webcomic recommendation time ! These are three of my favorites that I think will appeal to a good many of you guys , even if you aren't into that stuff . Those of you who are might know a few of these titles ! :) \

Weirdest Core class ever . 
Ogleturkey , you no longer surprise me . I think I may be getting used to this place . 
is going to see < PROPMALE > Waters of Pink < PROPMALE > tonight at Philips Arena . 
I have an electric sheep . Now all I need is an android to dream about it and I'll be set . 
I am hungry and I have no food . This is kind of a tragedy . 
Who wants to slack off and watch The < PROPFEMALE > Bride with me ? Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is also an option . 
has three papers and a Japanese exam to do before Friday . I assume it could be worse . 
I wonder if I should just accept the inevitable and < PROPMALE > in being a hermit . 
Didn't think I was that horribly girly until just this evening . OUT , INSECT . OUT OF MY ROOM . Don't make me shriek even louder . I will bust your buggy eardrums ! 
has a new haircut , needs a new photo . 
To go to bed , or to watch more space pirates ? Decisions , decisions . 
Would liking Gaia Online make me a total weeaboo ? 
I'm back at my dorm room ! Drop by and say hi , and I'll give you a cookie ! 
Can one ship packages from Oglethorpe ? 
I've never not felt like writing a story before . This lack of will kind of frightens me .
