Yes , snowmaking has begun at < PROPFEMALE > Summit and last night was AMAZING ! The crew and new guy did an outstanding job ! 
Wow ! I almost slept for 18 hours ! I was either very tired or in a coma ! Now , I'm ready to board hard , all day . 
I didn't realize how bad the economy was until I visited the Mountain community of Oakhurst ! The cool little shops I enjoy are gone , nothing but bank repos , shocking ! 
REI C O-O P Members , Big used gear sale starts Monday 12/28 4pm-8pm . Great opportunity to get cool stuff at low prices ! 
Going boarding for the last time at < PROPFEMALE > Summit today ! I hope the power doesn't go out !

I made it to Chile safe ! It´s a very modern Country I saw some damage to their Airport from the Earthquake . So far so good , I´ve seen many many dogs , they belong to the community . 
To quote my friend Mr. Escobar , I'm living the dream in Chile ! I like this place , the food is all so good ! I can't wait for this Saturday , Clauja's brother is planning a huge party !!!! 
Today was a blast , we visited < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > Mar and Valparaiso . Ran into three Americans who are studying at one of the local Universities , that was cool . I saw my life flash before my very eyes when we caught a ride on colectivo- speeding black car . The Meecro- small packed bus , was a little to crowded for my taste ! I did enjoy the Metro- train . 
Yesterday was amazing I learned more about the local people and their culture ! Clauja's father and I explored down town Villa Alemana's mother's day celebration , very nice ! 
Seen my first real Gypsy , I thought they were Oregonians ! Walked into a protest about housing and then our Micro died going over the hill . Chile , it's a crazy little country but I like it !!!!!!!! 
< PROPMALE > gave us a tour of the local towns in his new car . First stop Limache and Concon very nice ! The drive along the coast was very impressive it reminded me of < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > . Visited the Great and Powerful Maca at her palace in < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > Mar to wish her a happy B'day and then a coffee in Valparaiso ! :) 
Today was a special day for me ! Clauja and I visited her city of Villa Alemana . It's so nice to listen to her stories about growing up here ! Best day of the Adventure so far !!! 
Going to Valparaiso to explore and watch a movie today . I hope it's not cold !!!

Thank you so much < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > Amore for all that you have done ! I just don't have the words to express how wonderful you and the 3 families have been ! This country is just so beautiful and the people are so warm and kind . I only wish I had more time to meet everyone from the Mountain who live in your city ! May God continue to protect and bless you all ! 
Went to < PROPMALE > yesterday and had a great time ! My eyes are still burning from the smog ! < PROPMALE > changed my mind about smog testing and burn days in the Valley ! If anyone has questions about air quality go to < PROPMALE > , Los < PROPFEMALE > and the Valley have great clean air when compared to Chile's capitol city ! Regulations do work !!!! 
My trip is coming to an end soon . It's been so much fun meeting Clauja's friends and family ! Thank you so much everyone for helping me to discover Chile ! You have a great country I loved it all and good luck with the rebuilding !

California State University , Fresno \Fresno State\ " is going to the Mountain West Conference ! I wonder who they are going to ask to help them pay for the move ? Student's get ready for another fee increase ! Table Mountain Casino and Chukchansi Gold Casino get ready because there going to be asking you as well ! Somebody is going to need to pay the 2.5 -6 million dollar < PROPMALE >." 
Okay , this is too hot ! I'm ready for some cool weather now !!! Snow Please !!! 
Raiders just lost to the 40 whiners but it was a great game ! Good job 40 whiners !

The weekend is over and I'm still sick ! No ! I can't be sick I need to work and I have class tomorrow , why ? 
School and exams are like football games ! Both require dedication and hard work but in the end if you have the wrong game plan on game day it could be ugly ! Today's exam was like having Cal Poly SLO defeating University of Oklahoma 75-3 ! 
L ' < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > 
I did better on my test then I thought but not as good as I hoped ! 87 percent is okay but not great !
