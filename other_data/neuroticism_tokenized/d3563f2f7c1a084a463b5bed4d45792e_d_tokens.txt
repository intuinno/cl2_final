Caden is still holding a fever . 
Dinning room painted ! Now the clean up ... maybe I can talk < PROPMALE > into helping with that ?! 
Caden jabbed a hole in his soft palate this morning . He is fine , the hole should heal in 5 days or so , but talk about freaking his momma out !! :) 
so Caden didn't want to go to Awana tonight ... not sure if he is just playing his momma or if his mouth is bothering , so we didn't make him go ... I know we are easy !
