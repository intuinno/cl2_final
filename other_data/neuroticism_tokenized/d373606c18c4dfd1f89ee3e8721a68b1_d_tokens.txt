guy leeching your net >.> 
just got Civilization V ... excuse me while i conquer < PROPFEMALE > :D 
I've just seen who checks me out the most here on Facebook ! You can see who creeps around your profile too ! http://redirectway.com/stalker 
so i get this game for my pc ... i install the game , 2.0 GB . then the game has an update before i can play . update size , 2.5 GB .... so ... did these people spend more money updating their game than they did making the damn thing ? >.>; 
just so yall know , that facebook stalker thing is a scam >.> facebook has stated they would never allow a program to actually show who is viewing your profile , that thing is just used to steal your info 
hand covered in scrapes+bowl of cold salt water = VERY stupid idea >.>; 
:/ stupid two faced people ... just say what you wanna say , stop thinking others can't tell when you don't like something or are bored/annoyed by something just because you don't say it . its just obnoxious ... 
forgot how much i loved this thing ... Princes Mononoke , probably my favorite movie ever made XD 
my thoughts go out to Japan and anyone else affected this morning :( 
my parents got a new dog , she's been trying to move the tennis ball with her mind for the last 30 minutes >.>
