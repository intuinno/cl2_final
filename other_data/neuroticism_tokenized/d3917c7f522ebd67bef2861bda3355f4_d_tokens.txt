HAPPY BIRTHDAY < PROPFEMALE > !!! 
Why is it impossible for me to be satisfied with less than my impossibly high expectations ? 
We didn't start the fire ... 
Romance movies are the reason every girl has an unnaitanable < PROPFEMALE > to marry the sexiest man alive . The girl always gets the hottie , and the personality to boot . 
I hate it when it just doesn't work out ... 
Sometimes people grow apart instead of growing together , and it just can't be helped . 
Brazilians are cute ... too bad they're from BRAZIL . 
Summer ... 
Last few questions on the WHAP study guide ... >.<;

Hooray for me ... :/ 
Pride and Prejudice ... with < PROPMALE > Firth ... ^^ 
You know you're an AP student when you learn to survive without breathing because you don't have time to spend on such a luxury . 
Molly : \I but dialed Garth ... \ " \ 
< PROPMALE > ran into a cactus ... 
My dad is buying a truck today ! Yeah ! Maybe I can actually practice my driving on a regular basis now ... 
Don't run with the herd . Be a big rock . 
Loving \ 
isn't so easy \ 
as plucking flower petals \ 
and circumstances \ 
trap us in our tangled \ 
attractions \ 
like dew drops on \ 
spider's silk --- \ 
it may stick for a while \ 
but eventually it falls \ 
from the invisible thread . \ 
You think you know what \ 
you want , but ... 
You need to learn to not interrupt me when I'm talking to myself . 
I need something to do ... >.< 
And you're just jealous because we act like complete idiots in public and people still love us . 
Dad : The people who try hardest to look like adults are usually the ones who are most immature . 
Grr ... facebook procrastination of chores only works for so long ... >.<; 
\Going to church doesn't make you a christian any more than standing in a garage makes you a car . \"" 
Tomorrow : Hiking , Purity Group . :) 
\And no one notices the contrast of white on white ... \"" 
Molly : \I need to make time for my life ... \"" 
Guitar Lessons ! Starting Tuesday ! :DDD 
It's not that we didn't talk , it's that we weren't talking . 
A person is intelligent , but people are stupid . 
I shoulda just kept my mouth shut ... 
Saw Toy Story 3 . BEST ONE OF ALL THREE . 
Scored a 5 on the WHAP Test . >:D 
Got my purity ring today . :) 
\And so it is\ 
I MISS MY BFF . Good thing she's due back in a couple days . MOLLYYYY ... We'd better have some classes together this year . I can't take another year of not seeing you during the school day .

\ 
POKE me if you ever had a crush on me . LIKE this status if you think i'm a good friend . MESSAGE me if you ever wanted a relationshop with me . COMMENT on this status if we have ever had good memories . Now let's see who's brave enough to copy & paste this on their status . 
From day one I talked about getting out\ 
But not forgetting about\ 
How my worst fears are letting out\ 
He said why put a new address\ 
On the same old loneliness\ 
When breathing just passes the time\ 
Until we all just get old and die\ 
Now talking's just a waste of breath\ 
And living's just a waste of death\ 
And why put a new address \ 
And this is you and me\ 
And me and you\ 
Until we've got nothing left 
is going to own at guitar soon . xP 
The more I learn to play the guitar , the more I like it . It's a wonderfully vicious cycle . <3 
You know what ? Screw Boys . God , can I marry you ?

Just finished the Grapes of Wrath essay . :D 
you know what ? Ten days and I'm an Upper Classman ! xD 
Molly : We don't go straight to heaven because then bad people would get in . It'd be like school , the bad people would get detention . But bad people don't get into heaven , so there is no detention and we all eat lunch together . 
The Purity Ring Dinner was Awesome ! None of the watermelons screamed at us , we didn't use fat free cream cheese ( without all the fat in it ) , and we all decided to be big rocks . xD I'll put photos up as soon as I can . 
So what the heck is with < PROPFIRST > and Rosasharn taking a tumble in the back of truck during the ride ? I mean , seriously , there are children in the back of that truck with them ! 
The fingertips on my left hand are flattening from guitar . :3 
Wow . So he takes a tumble with Rosasharn in the back of the truck in the middle of the night the very moments when her grandma is dying , and then up and deserts her the very next day . What a jerk . 
Holy crap . Half of the grapes of wrath is people saying they ' don't wanna go ' or ' won't go ' , and other people trying to convince them they have to . 
One week . 
Last guitar lesson before school starts is tomorrow ... :( 
Birthday Wish List : Guitar .

Brought the Christmas Tree home today . Named it < PROPFEMALE > . 
Message me a number . I'll post something about you on my profile using the number as your alias . 
12345 : I don't know who I talked to before I met you . You are such an indispensable , irreplaceable part of my life now that I can't imagine what these last few years would have been like without you . And I can't imagine ever NOT being friends . Sometimes you're a bit silly , but I love you . Being friends with you has been a real adventure , and I can't wait to see what comes next ! 
33 : Wow . It's been forever , hasn't it ? I haven't seen you in a few years , but I'll never forget the times we shared in middle school . You were a great friend , and I miss you . I'm sorry you never got a nickname . You helped make my middle school experience into something I'll look back on with fondness for years to come , and I thank you for that ! Thanks for accepting me in all my craziness . :) 
9 days till Christmas . When did that happen ??? I really need to get a move on with my Christmas shopping .
