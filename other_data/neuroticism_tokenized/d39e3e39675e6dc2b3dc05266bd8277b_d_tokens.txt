New profile pic , yaycollar ! :D 

PAX WAS AWESOME ! All those who didn't go ... ... Hahahahahaha XD sucks to be you . Epic pain from walking so much , lots of random stuff and pics from the expo hall , head still spinning from the lolsy panels , and I'm amazed I didn't catch anything from the close quarters and hand-shaking ( and high-fiveing ) I did . 
If you are reading this , even if we don't speak often , post a comment of a memory of you and me . When you've finished , post this on your own status . You'll be surprised what people remember about you ... 
Wireless phones = Death to wifi . Every time it rings I get disconnected . Do you realize how much more I hate telemarketers now ? Do you ? 
How awesome : the only reason I do not have straight A's is because I don't have all my work in all my classes ( I was started a week late ) All of my work thus far ... Grade A quality . I am going to ace this year ! 
<3 Mine and < PROPFEMALE>'s six month anniversary today :D this requites many hearts <3 <3 <3 I'm really really reallly happy <3 <3 
We interrupt your regularly scheduled Facebooking for this important announcement HAAAAAAAAAAAAM ! We now return you to your Facebooking already in progress . 
It was AWESOME seeing you guys today ! :D And those of you I didn't see , I'll be at Cutter's Point again next Thursday , and the Thursday after that , and the one after that , and the one after that , and so on and so forth ad nauseum . From 10 ~ until school is out , and then I'll head home :) I expect to see more of you people . INCLUDING YOU GRADUMATADED SENIORS . 
When : Tomorrow , 10-4 Where : Cutter's Point Who : ME :D Why : To see people , you better stop by e.o 
oops , slept like the dead + massive back pain that's got me hobbling = so not going downtown today , try again next week >.< 
>.> tomorrow's thursday . Guess where I'll be . 
I realized it's a week to Halloween and I haven't watched any scary movies . SUGGESTIONS PLEASE ! ( zombie and werewolf films are love o.o ) ( ... links are love too , I can't rent or download ) 
So I broke my school laptop on Saturday . The school , being the awesome people that they are , quickly responded and today I got my shiny un-broken laptop . I still don't know what I'm supposed to do with the broken one though ... 
Happy Halloween people ( hope yours is less boring than mine ) 
.... I am going to watch Nightmare Before Christmas . Some of you already know ( some of you do not ) but for a reason too long to post , the movie ( even as awesome as it is , I love it ) scares me . terrifies me . the music sends me running , screaming , leaving me shaking . Wish me luck ? ( gawd I'm stupid o.o ) 
This time getting lost was not my fault . The Trip Planner lied about where the 255 would be . Trust me . I stood there for an hour . Luckily , Seattle's Best has free wifi , and I have a laptop and an Orca pass :D So not stuck , alternate route obtained ! 
Gaia announced the winner for the Demonbuster's event . :| That was a crappy ending . 
So I'm totally unpacked . For those ( everyone ? ) not in the know , I moved in with my dad ( hi dad :D ) and we got my stuff yesterday and I spent yesterday and today unpacking and setting up my bedroom . It's the shit :D I don't yet have my posters up or my fountains running but there's a place for everything and everything in its place . OMGWTFBBQ INORITE ? :) 
I went out and ran/walked ( more of the latter ) . I will be coughing for a while but I feel pretty good for going out and ... going out . AFTER getting my schoolwork done ! HA ! I wasn't even procrastinating ! 
Hoppy Year of the Rabbit everyone ! The neighbors are bringing it in with a helluva bang :D 
Tomorrows aoup wil mean delicious ham three days in a row . Kosher I am not XD 
I lost the game . 
omnomnom burritos 
< PROPFEMALE > The Vampire Slayer apparently airs on MTV now . ........ wut ? 
If you & I woke up in jail together ... using only FOUR words ... what would you say to me ? Copy and paste this in your status and see what funny things your friends say .... ( And if you make a comment , you gotta put this in your status . Fair is fair . ) 
Down in Tacoma for a while , anyone wanting to meet up , tell me when and where :D 
Come on guys ! I'm in Tacoma ! I wanna seeee yooouuu ! :D I just don't know who wants to see me ! D: 
Oh , also , I was in Tacoma for a -week- . You guys are jerks . See you at SakuraCon :P 
< Yalborap > You'll get so infuriated you'll throw your DS/Wiimote against the wall until it shatters . < Yalborap > The wall , not the nintendo product . < Yalborap > Those things are made of adamantium or some crap . Ala http://bash.org/?803011 
took a break from her laptop today to just look out a window for a while and was rewarded with the sight of a beautiful blue < PROPFIRST > . 
It's rai ~ ning , it's pour ~ ing :D 
I just lost the game :| Worst : I did it to myself . 
RT @LearnFromMyFail Butter Knife - Learn From My Fail #LFMF http://bit.ly/aiLfTZ 
owtf I lost the game -again- . I usually try to keep it down to 1/month :| 
hatemybody . hatemybody . hatemybody . Don't ask . 
Lapboys , they make you lose the game . And me too :| 
Nice day , so I'm on the back porch with my laptop , enjoying the overcastness and PERFECT temp and complete lack of wind . I want to run in trees , but I don't think I can make it to Point Defiance for the really awesome trees ... 
sick ... ugh ... shoot me 
guh ... picked up my room ... it's not ' clean ' but it's not a death trap either ... now I'm going to collapse somewhere . 
I'm sneezing so hard the vents are vibrating X| 
Oyeah folks , my phone is broken , so if you need me , either message me or email me . Blah 
Facebook just suggested I switch to English ( UK ) ... I did . I don't see anything different ... yet . 
So I realized I've become completely disconnected from my SoTA friends ... 
Also , SoTA , what's up with your computers ? I needed to be signed off by anyone upper-level at SoTA to have another semester/year at Insight , and apparently I'm not in the system anymore . Uhm ... what ? I leave the school so you unfriend me ? Uncool SoTA , uncool 
... do people even read their event invitations anymore ? :| 
... where are my inane ramblings going back for over a year ? 
So , lightning and thunder . The thunder a few minutes ago ? I almost crapped myself . That is the loudest thunder I have ever heard , it was like a boulder rolling for the house . Scary as crap o.o ' 
I AM IN TACOMA . People , friends , I know you check your facebook , I see your posts , do ANY of you want to see me ? 
Screwed up my neck , IT HURTS A LOT . I need many interesting websites to pass the time . Anyone have anything for me ? 
< PROPFEMALE > made me lose the game . Reconsidering this relationship :| 
STUFF HAPPENED . I HAVE A LIFE . MORE UPDATES LATER . 
Apologies to everyone who doesn't know already , it's been chaos lately . I'M MOVING ! \ 
To * drumroll * ... \ 
.... \ 
..... \ 
Vermillion ! South < PROPFEMALE > ! 
You know all those movies and shows where the plot is ' What if you could do it over ? ' I've thought about this for years , and there is nothing I would do over . Nothing I would try to make better . I would , however , be ... beyond thrilled ... overjoyed ... to simply relive sophomore year . Amazingly , that is my ' simpler time ' . And I'd give ... I'd give a lot to hit replay on it . 
Went for a walk to enjoy the good northwest air and rare northwest sun . Out for almost an hour . 
< PROPFEMALE > left a little bit ago . To drive here . And get me . Because I'm moving . AAAAAAHHHH ! I'M MOVING ! 
Walked three < PROPMALE > and have a blister for each one . 
OH MY GOD KRISSY'S GOING TO BE HERE SOON . \ 
Like , within a couple hours , soon . 
In the home stretch and she hits rush hour traffic . Figures . 
obtw she got here safe and sound and then I spazzed and didn't update . Distracted ( can you blame me ? )\ 
And we totally got lost getting off the freeway . NOTE TO SELF : WHEN IN DOUBT , TURN LEFT 
You just lost the game , my bad 
Car is packed , we hit burger < PROPMALE > and starbucks and we're on the freeway . <3 < PROPFEMALE > for providing road tunes , miss the fam already . 
< PROPFEMALE > is bored already , we still have 7 hours of driving today . Oboy . 
Listening to Wicked at full blast while driving down I-90 15 < PROPMALE > away from Ellensburg . Hell yeah . 
Omg , gas station with a comicbook rack . We bought three , all from the early 90's . 
We stopped in a Big Lots in Cour d'Alene at 9pm to buy a beach ball and nothing else . 
Whoo , awake now . Gonna head out before noon , local time . 
KFC for breakfast , I grabbed a double down ( google it ) if I suddenly stop updating , I had a heart attack and died . 
Also , can someone please explain to me what a ' smoke jumper ' is , I keep seeing sogns referencing them . 
So , there was a giant white M on a hill by Missoula and now there's a giant white D by Drummond . Is this a Montana thing ? 
At the only rest stop for the next 97 < PROPMALE > . Baking to death in the sun . 
Leaving the rest stop in Goldcreek MT where we smacked the beachball around . 
Fulfilled my passengerly duty of passing out . Woke up as we pulled into a rest stop 30 < PROPMALE > from Billings , MT . Also , it's now raining . Big splatterly drops . 
Just crossed into Wyoming . THERE IS WAY TOO MUCH SKY HERE !!! 
D: we've passed , like , a dozen hitchhikers . I feel like a TERRIBLE person , even though the seat is FILLED with my crap . 
... and we just cross3d over Crazy Woman Creek . I'm gonna be nice and assume it's a native american name . 
Heading to Applebees before leaving Gillette . There is still too much sky . 
Hitting the road now , had to grab my hat so as not to be blind . 
I swear to god the ' adopt a highway ' litter control for this section was adopted by Hamsters USA . Go go little guys , clean that trash . 
\Bear Butte State Park\ " * immature giggling * " 
Douchenozzle < PROPFIRST > Lucas-look-alike was texting and driving on the interstate , in a one < PROPFIRST > construction zone , swerving like a drunk . 
Almost hit an otter running across the freeway in Murdo , SD . 
Gas station sign , I think ; ' Next rest stop : Anyone's guess ' 
I'M BORED . CAN YOU TELL ? 
Hit Sioux Falls and got delicious heart attacks from Wendys . We're almost home ! 
Look , I know I dont drive , but gas is 2.59 out here . \ 
P.S. In Vermillon , hells yeah . 
Finally woke up , still sick . I can't shake this cough , which didn't make the trip anymore enjoyable . 
I COOKED REAL FOOD . Made a bastardized stir fry with some beef and zucinni and carrots and broccoli and mushrooms . It's tasty and no one's died ! 
Still sick . Slowly dieing . Lungs are full of fluid . Fluid I am coughing up lots . 
I cooked real food AGAIN . Today I bastardized teriyaki . Got green peppers to add and force < PROPFEMALE > to eat . Next time : Onions . 
Rock on . Just finished making breakfast . Bacon n egg breakfast sammiches on rolls , ( egg white only for < PROPFEMALE > , she can't eat yolk ) and six big blueberry muffins . 
AUGH . Drove 8 hours to < PROPFEMALE>'s friend's wedding yesterday . Dressed fanceh today . Got my geek on with all of < PROPFEMALE>'s friends and tomorrow we're heading to a cabin by a LAKE . Who knows , I might get a TAN . 
Accidentally chicken fried myself , plus knees hurting from pedal boating AND bruised my thighs climbing back into the canoe after I accidentally tipped it . I pretty much can't walk . So fun . Driving home now . 
lets . 
So as I was trying to say last night , I splashed hot grease on my arm . It's fine now , but ouch man o.o 
If anyone wonders what I've been up to\ 
http://concept < PROPMALE > . org/forums/showthread . php ? p = 2792964\ 
I'm making < PROPMALE > . This is my sketchbook thread . It updates much more than my deviantArt , which is more for finished things . 
Hail truck farmer ! Hail truck farmer ! 
... I keep forgetting my password . 
Just discovered the best thing about being ' grown up ' ... 12 toaster strudel per package and they're MINE , ALL MINE ! MAHAHAHA ! 
Dude ... what ? \ 
I just got a verification email from an adult dating site . I ... don't go to those kinds of websites . 
< PROPFEMALE > Sullivan ( voice of Shego ) will be playing < PROPFEMALE > in $#*t My Dad Says , a sitcom based on the popular twitter feed Shit My Dad Says . Shatner will be playing the dad . \ 
It's like two vastly disconnected parts of my life have come together in a glorious ... I don't know . But it's awesome . Starts sept . 3rd . 
Reading Nightlight ( Twilight parody book ) . It's like < PROPFEMALE > B . Jones meets Twilight . ....... insane . And painful . GO READ IT ! 
Oh this is getting STUPID . \ 
< PROPFEMALE>'s parents ... They've gone off the deep end . And her older sister pushed . 
Well , it took a while but the truth of the matter came out . Her parents do indeed hate me because I am female . Her mother called her and got to the root of the problem . That we were hugging and kissing while her younger ( a year older than me ) sister was in the house . OH NO ! It's ' morally reprehensible ' because we're both women . \ 
\ 
I'm suddenly not even angry any more . I can't maintain anger at bigotry . It's pointless . 
Okay that's just dumb . Looked in the fridge for the chicken I'd put in day before yesterday to thaw from the freezer . It wasn't anywhere to be found . So I thought for a moment and looked in the trash . Lo . There it was . Factory sealed and just FINE . 
Feeling emo , watching < PROPFEMALE > Snaps and then maybe Resident Evil ( all of em ) to make me feel better . 
Apparently being gay is just as bad as making/perpetuating/owning child pornography . \ 
Anyone who thinks we should stick it out , suck on that . 
Trying to get my joints to settle so I can nap . So stressed I can't even tell what time it is anymore . 
The 10th is $1 sketch day ! 24 hours of requests and < PROPMALE > , $1 per request , taking all comers ! This Friday ! 
Repeat : The 10th is $1 sketch day ! 24 hours of requests and < PROPMALE > , $1 per request , taking all comers ! This Friday ! 
< PROPFEMALE > made banana bread with the bananas that her sister misplaced . 
SPAM ! The 10th is $1 sketch day ! 24 hours of requests and < PROPMALE > , $1 per request , taking all comers ! This Friday ! 
I put on my headphones and suddenly I'm in my own little world . It's a very upbeat place . 
Friday , $1 Sketches , now to be broadcasted live ! More info to come . 
So ... we totally do not get to keep the car . And they apparently were not very nice about it . Oh well , that's only a minor setback . 
I squashed an innocent cricket with a boot . I feel terrible . 
Roughly 19 hours until the start of the 24 hour broadcast , live drawing session for $1 Sketch Day ! Be there ! Or else ! :D 
Got off to a technically < PROPMALE > start but after some maneuvering and taping , we're good to go ! 
Mortal Kombat Anihilation is on in the background . I'm not paying attention and it's like ... scene change AND SUDDENLY THERE IS A BLACK GUY who is apparently a character ! 
8 hours in , this couch is very comfy and there's not a lot holding my attention right now . We may have a problem . 
OH NO . \ 
... \ 
I'm yawning . 
Feeling a little disenheartened . Consider : 11 hours passed , 2 sketches done . 
... I feel like I just witness a Twitter hissy fit . \ 
http://twitter.com/wilw\ 
http://twitter.com/GamePolitics\ 
Both sides of it . 
It's like the second one thing starts going right , another has to go wrong . My bad tooth started bleeding from the inside ( it's hollow ) 
I lost the game and it's all < PROPFEMALE>'s fault . 
I need to stop watching < PROPFEMALE>'s Got Talent finales . Freaking < PROPFIRST > Grimm won over < PROPFIRST > AND over Fighting Gravity AND over < PROPMALE > Poppycock . COME ON . AAAAAAAUUUUUGGGGHHHHHH 
Sometimes you just need some new clothes to make you really ... stand out :D 
Starting packing today , leaving on Monday . 
More packing . Getting all my < PROPMALE > books boxed up . Added up the cover prices for all of them once , came to over $350 ! 
I am feeling sort of zen , now . We visited < PROPFEMALE>'s folks yesterday and they were ... better than they have been . I have nothing to stress about , just need to finish getting packed . 
Been packing off and on all night , keep having to stop cause my back and neck are locking up . Got a lot of stuff into a few boxes , thanks mom for passing along mad Tetris skills . 
< PROPFEMALE > got to pick up the car a little early , she's coming back now and we're gonna start shoving things ( neatly ) in . I think I packed well enough that we can get it all in . I fully expect two or three boxes worth of things to suddenly appear when we start clearing out . 
Delayed the mission last night , < PROPFEMALE > had food poisoning . Now we're really on our way ! 
So the phone died . Were at a motel for the night , way too long a drive to do at once 
Back on the road , nearing Cour D'a-Ican'tspellit 
In spokane , almost there ! 
Arrived last night , safe n sound . Returned the car later today and everything is great . Cats are thrilled to see me and puppy is terrified of me . 
I just lost the game :| 
Sick , lost my voice . Woo-h*chokes * 
DM'd tonight ! I feel like it was a success , even if a CERTAIN SOMEOME didn't show up , and we only played for about 3 hours . Also it wasn't Halloween themed . 
http://transfinite.dreamwidth.org/215469.html DeviantArt is piloted by bigoted jerks . 
http://lgbt-on-da.deviantart.com/blog/36050661/\ 
Sometimes hurt is borne of malice . Sometimes it is mere ignorance . When apologies have been made and steps taken to right wrongs , I think it is time to forgive . 
Just watched the puppy for a good five minutes as he tried to get a bone from the bottom of his toy basket , a basket he is TERRIFIED of . Grampa even tipped it over and he still spent a minute trying to get it out while dodging the horrifying basket . 
Omg . Unmarked cop car was out front doing doughnuts . It waited in line behind a truck doing the same . 
can't sleep , going to play Katamari Damaci and watch Full Metal Panic Fumoffu 
Body gave me a rude awakening . Threw up and you don't want to know what else :( 
:| My tummy really hurts . This is so uncool . 
And now I've lost my voice too , will wonders never cease ? 
Nothing pisses me off quite like insults disguised as unsolicited advice . Especially when the ' advisor ' doesn't even use spellcheck . 
17 hours on this pic . Better ' preciate :| 
Christmas shopping with < PROPFEMALE > . Stopped at Old Country Buffet to fuel up . Watching her eat grits , ew . 
I AM AT THE POKEMON CENTER IN THE TACOMA MALL . THIS IS AWESOME , directly in front of Nordstrom , down the hall . 
Got Flamung Wok fir lunch , < PROPFEMALE > got a fortune cookie , reads \Give an inch and they take a mile . \ " I lol'd " 
At the mall again , anyone in the area come find me ! 
Too excited for tree decorating , slipped and fell on my butt , laughed until I cried n.n 
< PROPFEMALE > CHRISTMAS ... PREEEESENNNNNTSSSSSSS 
I have a pipe :3 -u ~ 
< PROPMALE > just dropped the remote in my full glass of water . Its fine o.o 
Went out first thing in the morning ( 10am ) packed the pipe just right and wound up out there for over an hour . 
Oh god I love this desktop ,. Dwarf Fortress gets 5x the fps as on the laptop 
Krissys boobs are magic , they spoke to me :o 
:( just had a really bad seizure , knocked me on my ass for a few minutes 
Playing Monopoly with < PROPFEMALE > , we need to game night this shit :D 
Had my DSHS funded checkup , Mr. Doctorpants didnt say much to me , well see what Mr. Phsychiatrypants has to say in a couple weeks . 
When did it become 11 ? Goodnight < PROPFEMALE > . 
z . z skept like a rock on ny right arm , its aching now . I just cant win . 
Had a dream in which I yelled profusely ( in front of a large audience ) at people who I blame for how messed up I am . 
Playin ' me some WoW . Started up a Tauren Druid and just got the ability to change into a cat . You bet I'm leaping and bounding all over the plains ! :D 
Oh yeah iTunes you can find cover < PROPMALE > for < PROPFIRST > Swift and < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > but not Def Leppard ? 
New haircut , pictures forthcoming . 
Dear Skype , you suck . Fix your webpage . I need you on my PC . 
Nosebleed . Right off the bat . Fuckin ' yeah ? 
Oh yeah . This morning . < PROPFEMALE > found a white hair in my eyebrow . MY hair . MY eyebrow hair . I pulled it out and marvelled . Pure white . The heck ? 
Just finished monopoly at $2 , 222 , < PROPFEMALE > beat me by $133 
Tomorrow I get to see a shrink for social security . Should be fun . 
Going through facebook and reading friends and ex-classmate's statuses I realize that we have silently slipped out of high school , out of being teenagers with teenage worries into young adults , with college and friends and partners changing everything in their quiet ways . 
I love the little things that connect in hindsight . I went to PAX ' 09 . At PAX I went to a panel , I can't even remember who was there or what it was about , but I heard about ConceptArt.org . I went to CA and st < PROPMALE > ed learning to take criticism . My < PROPMALE > has flourished and I find myself eager to see what the next connections will be . 
< PROPFEMALE > hopped up on my shoulder a minute ago . She hopped off and I had a little itch . I scratch and lo .... she has given unto me ... fleas . Great . Time to go dunk myself in the tub and drown the lil **** ers . 
ZOMBIE TACOMAPOCALYPSE IS TODAYYYYYYYY ! 
Back from the OMG ZOMBIES . If you missed the event tonight stop by the Amocat anytime until the end of the month to see the < PROPMALE > ! 
OH CRAP I STILL HAVE TO GET A SKETCHUARY PIECE IN >.< 
Went to gamestop to get < PROPFEMALE > Trull a shiny Suicune :D 
HAVING A CHALKBOARD DOES NOT MAKE YOU SMART , < PROPFIRST > BECK . 
My friends talk too much . Hello 300+ Most Recent ! I missed you during my 24hour dry spell :P 
@_@ hauled my trunk upstairs . Heavy . 
Starting up recording for the next horrendous Twilight reading . I WILL INFLICT IT UPON YOU ALL ! 
Duct taped my good camera to my monitor so that people watching A Very Fandom Reading can actually .... see shit . 
So , my camera hates me . HATES me . I made the video ( see it on Monday ) but oh my god . 
Whoo , got my rejection letter for social security disability . Yeah , know what ? I'm not going through that crap again . That took way too long for nothing . I'm just going to try and get insurance the old fashioned way so I can go to Vancouver Film School and migrate to Canuckistan . 
WOW it is < PROPFEMALE > !
