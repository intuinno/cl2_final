I have 12 viruses on my laptop . It's my lucky day . :D 

I'm thinking about people who've already put me out of their minds . 
Our cute little break is almost over , what a drag . ): But at least I get to see my friends again . :) 
Just got my schedule for next year . Excited to find out who I'm having classes with . :) 
Going to sleep and not waking up at 7:00 in the morning for school . Oh HALLE-EFFING-LUJAH !!!!!!!!! < :D 
I'm packing up my bag for school tomorrow . Good-bye summer break . ): >
