I am a woman . Not only am I feminine , but I am strong . Strong-minded , strong-willed , strong-hearted . I am intelligent , an intuitive thinker , a nurturer and a lover . I am strategical , hard-working , and beautiful . I am grand , and wonderful .. but most of all , I am a woman . -Heaven < PROPFIRST > Hanson 07-27-10\

I don't want to fall another moment into your gravity . Here I am , and I stand .. so tall . Just the way I'm supposed to be . <3 
--> So , my toenail was viciously ripped off by a humungous man-eating monster ! Okay I stretched it , but I'm pretty sure that's what it felt like . So , afterwards me and my bright self decided I would paint my toes . Long story short- I'm in horrific pain .

is deathly afraid of camel spiders . o . 0 
--> Love is our resistance . They'll keep us apart and they wont stop breaking us down . Hold me . Our lips must always be sealed . If we live a life in fear , I'll wait a thousand years .. just to see you smile again . <3 
--> The Happy Girls Are The Prettiest . *.< 3 . * 
--> Their tears are filling up their glasses . No expression . Bite my head I want to drown my sorrow , no tomorrow . I find of kind it funny , I find it kind of sad . The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had . I find it hard to tell you , I find it hard to take . When people run in circles it's a very , very mad world . - < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > \Mad World \"" 
--> I'm not a doll you can just kick around when you're angry or upset . I'm so much more .. and it's you're fault you won't realize that . 
--> So ! I kind of got to talk to him again . xD He makes me smile . :) Went school-shopping out at the legends this evening , they had a power-outage ! It was pitch black in the darned stores ! It was fun though , I wish it'd happen more often . :D <3 
--> Hmm . Tomorrow . First day of school . Nervous ? No . Ready to stress teachers out ? Yes . :) <3 
--> I kind of lucked out . I didn't think I was going to have ANY eye < PROPFEMALE > in my classes but I do . He's in one of my favorite classes , and he's one of my favorites in that class . He's gorgeous . :) <3 
--> Okay , well Ms. Heaven < PROPFIRST > is sick . Soar throat , runny nose . Summer ... how could you do this to me ? I thought you were different . :o 
--> Today is going to be an especially long day . Anyone have any aspirin ? 
--> Maybe instead of catching you every time you fall , I should let you hit the ground . Then , you might realize what you're doing wrong and fix it yourself for once . 
--> I'm thinking .. instead of laughing at me behind my back , do it while I'm looking at you . You say you hate fake females , you're such a hypocrite . Take a look in the mirror , then ask yourself a question didn't your parents raise you better than that ? 
--> Ah well ... no inspirational quotes tonight . I love to give them to you all , but I have none for myself in my time of need ... Every time I think of a good one .. the worst possible case scenario replaces it . Sheesh . I wish I wasn't to in tune with phsycological manipulation . :\\ 
<-- Can't wait until tomorrow .! I get to see thee besties .. My Babe , and My Hubby . Ahhh , what a wonderful day this will be . <3 
--> He's gorgeous , sweet , and smart .. all in all he's amazing , and I can't wait to see him again . :) <3 
--> Tummy has been hurting all day .. went to the store and nearly fell flat on my face .. stupid flip-flop . Having a few flipping awesome conversations with < PROPFIRST > . :) Came home .. did 2 and 1/2 hours worth of homework and still have 8th hour homework left , study for etymology and research to do . Ahhh . Sumner Life . Isn't it wonderful ? 
--> You only live once . If you do it right , once is enough . <3 :) 
--> Today was a half-decent day . A bit of confusion about a person ... happy I got that situation settled with a different person . :) Ehh , I just hope tomorrows better . 
--> Tomorrow : A test in 1st hour ? Yes . A test in 3rd hour ? Yep . 5th hour ? Uhuh . 7th ? Unfortunatly yes . Anyone have any advice on how to cope with all the anticipation and stress ? 
--> Tomorrow should be fun . NO TESTS !!! <3 <3 Pep rally . :) Hopes I get to run the track a few times after school . Have a varsity game . Get to see my peoples . \ 
<3 09-03-10 <3 Will hopefully be a great day . 
--> He is unlike any guy I've ever met . <3 
--> The game last night was great . We won by about 10 points . Congratulations to all of the varsity football players for playing , and the cheerleaders/crowd for cheering them on . Everyone did their part to make an amazing night . Hope it happens again . :) <3 
--> Had a wonderful morning with < PROPFEMALE > Rogers Hanson at the Farmers Market . Mum is so hilarious . :D Had a seasonal fruit tart thing ... was delicious . Mum and her apostle ... lmbo . The \Hairy Bush . \ " Rofl !! Mum's amazing . :) <3 " 
--> I made myself bleed .. mosquitos don't understand the pain , agony , and itch they cause when they bite ! If they only knew what it was like .. has a mosquito ever been bitten by a mosquito ? Has a mosquito ever had an irritable itchy bump ? I think not , but I shall plot my revenge and mosquito's shall rule Africa no longer ! 
--> Does anyone remember the bulky black boot I had last year in effect of breaking my ankle ? Well .. I'm ( not so ) proud to present that it has returned . :o 
--> Why is it that every time you speak to someone you like , you either end up saying something stupid you immediately regret , something incoherent , OR stuttering ?! Grr . :\\ <3 
--> It's Heart break warfare . <3 
--> In Memory Of every single life that was lost during the 9/11 attack , I'd like to say you will never be forgotten . Your face shall forever be imprinted in the minds of the families you've been forced to leave behind , and they still love you ; just as it was before you gave your life , with every ounce of their bodies . We do too . <3 In Rememberance 9/11 <3 
--> Why must it be so full of anxiety , and suspence ? Why isn't is just as easy as singing ABC's ? Ahh , life ... the mysterious wonder . 
--> I know you’re so cool , but I must be a fool , for taking you in and letting you win control of my heart . <3 (: 
--> Why do creepy people have to be so scary ? :'( 
--> Today was the most amazing day of my life . I'm marking it on all of the calendars . : ) Oh ! He asked me to homecoming ! I'm so happy ! Of course I said yes , for those of you who are silly enough to ask that question . I can't wait . C [: <3 
--> What is up with people NOT going to homecoming lately ?! Everyone was going to go and now everyones not . :\\ Freshman homecoming should be one of the best memories of your life , just as well as Senior Prom . I wish I could share both of them with you all . :'( 
--> So , < PROPFEMALE > Bonanza , and < PROPFEMALE > were absolutely fabulous today in gym .. Sorry you had to do that today chica's . :[ But , thank you so much ! 
--> might be going dress shopping with my wife < PROPFEMALE > Remick , I hope so , because I can't wait . :DD <3 
--> Okay , so I changed the locks or whatever on my statuses to friends of friends , can EVERYONE see it now ? 
--> The only thing I dislike about you is .. Wait ... nothing ! :) <3 
--> Out of all the nicknames you could choose you chose \Lottie ? \ " Well people ... I guess that's my new nickname .. :| " 
--> Today was a great day . :) Karate was good , I enjoyed it . < PROPFEMALE > is starting to catch on , I think I'll start using that now . <3 Time to get ready for another day .. I wonder if tomorrow will be better ..? :) 
--> I'm just dreaming , counting the ways to where you are . <3 
--> Today ... Thursday ... no school .. mum got the conferences out of the way yesterday . < PROPFEMALE>'s over . <3 :) Dress shopping ... here we come . :P 
--> Going to spend the day with my wonderful wife < PROPFEMALE > Remick up until homecoming , with which I have probably the greatest guy ever to be going with . :) Honestly , I don't think today could get much better .. <3 :P 
--> I was right . Best date ever . I wish he didn't have to tolerate my ignorance though . He said he didn't have to tolerate me , but I know it's all lies . :P <3 
--> We shouldn't get homework over the weekend . It's called the weekend so we can celebrate the END of the WEEK . We deserve a break from homework ! 
--> So ! Tonights karate session was great . I need a favor from each and every one of you who are reading this right now ! I have raffle tickets I need to sell to raise money for Young Champions ! They are one dollar each and you have many chances to win awesome prizes !! :) 
--> Okay lady . Now you're really starting to make me mad . You want us to do the assignments 100% perfectly , no missing details .. but you can't even put the assignment on schoolloop ? Sorry chick , the last time I checked this is an IB school .. you can at least do your job . 
--> I'm glad I can push myself , and strive to reach my goals . Even through things I deteste the most . I never thought I would say perserverance has become my most inspirational vocabulary word .. 
--> Summer's gone ... Fall totally stabbed it in the heart . :( 
--> Today .. was .. wow . Hectic . Thanks < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > .. < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > .. < PROPMALE > Shaggy Escarpita .. and the lunch officer lady for having my back ! :) <3 
--> So .. this is the first time I have been on a different lap-top in 2 months .. I used to be a computer whiz on this lap-top .. now that I'm accustom to my < PROPMALE > I feel like such a retard ! I can't even click things without trying to copy and paste it ! 
--> During the relationship you are his everything .. his one and only and we would do nothing to hurt you . Yet , afterwards it's a calvary of insults and pointless phrases thrown back and fourth with the meaning of intentionally hurting the other . All the while , they both know they care for each other so much still , but both of them refuse to admit that truth . 
--> You make me smile . :P <3 
--> Think I might go running tomorrow after school ... anyone wanna come with ? 
--> Kids who aren't disciplined and get away with anything and everything get on my nerves . They seriously need to be tought how to behave . 
--> Not looking forward to the hour drive down into Topeka . SO looking forward to seeing all of my family . [: Can't wait ' till Monday . Karate .. yum . :P 
--> \Sometimes I worry about you . \ " \ " Why ? \ " \ " Because you're a crazy mother efferr ! \"" 
--> At home .. sick . Ugh . I'd so rather be at school and not sick . :'( 
--> I think I will stop believing in emotions ... I thought they were good things .. but all they do is bring trouble and hurt . 
--> Why is it , everytime .. AFTER it's done .. I realize what SHOULD HAVE happened ? Some things you just have to live with . 
--> Great game Freshmen ! Now , let's see what Varsity thinks they got . :P <3 
--> Haven't talked to him since Wednesday . Won't get to until Monday . :( I hope he doesn't think I'm avoiding him . 
--> Just cleaned the bathroom like an ancient maid ... all fours , with bleach , a rag , and a toothbrush . :) 
--> Any handsome knight is shining armor want to sweep me off my feet , take my breath away , marry me , and never have any arguements for the rest of our natural lifes ? Walt Disney ... did you plan on giving little girls false hope and breaking their hearts when they met a \real boy ? \"" 
--> Hopefully I get to talk to him tomorrow .. since I haven't since Wednesday . Gah . <3 Oh ! New hairstyle tomorrow guys ! I want opinions on it ! :D And , I want to know if I should cut it as well ! Comment , and tell me what you think ! 
--> Jealous of someone ! You know who you are . :P 
--> I just took .. 10 < PROPFEMALE > s of notes ... it took me two hours . And I was only supposed to take a < PROPFEMALE > and a half .. grr . < PROPFEMALE > told me I won't have much homework .. but you can count on it .. that this will be the only time we skip all of the rest of this chapter . :\\ 
--> Off to school .. this Friday is the end of the first quarter . Next quarter will definately be different ; I can promise you that . 
--> Have talked to him since Wednesda , practically ignored him today on the bus . Grr . Sorry love , I really wish you could read this . :[ 
--> I kinda really think I made a mistake .. and I kinda think it's really going to hurt me . :[ 
--> Surprisingly , your pathetic insults make me laugh . Insults are supposed to be hurtful < PROPFEMALE > , they weren't made to make you LoL . :) 
--> Got to talk to wonderfulness today . Simply .. great . :D 
--> Started homework at 5 . JUST got done with all geometry homework . Still have English , and Etymology .. and I still have to take a shower ... what a night this will be . o . 0

just wanted to say \Thanks for saving my life last night at the game\ " to < PROPFEMALE > Nava and < PROPFIRST > RelampagoBlanco Perez the both of you are great ! :) " 
--> The woman came from a mans rib . Not from his feet to be walked on . Not from his head to be superior , but from the side to be equal . Under the arm to be protected , and next to the heart to be loved . <3 
--> Have to come to my 2 wives , and boyfriends rescue today . On an extremely short notice too . Might as well just call me SuperWoman . 
--> Just got back from my date with < PROPFEMALE > . She's so wonderful ! <3 \ 
Heard a few things today that didn't leave me impressed . I heard the limit for a broken heart in pieces was 1,000 . I think mine's 1,001 . 0 . o 
--> I'd be lying if I told you losing you is something I could handle . 
--> I never knew that everything was falling through , that everyone I knew was waiting on a queue to turn and run when all I needed was the truth . But that's how it's gotta be ... 
--> I wish you could see what's going on on this side of the story ; I wish I could explain everything to you . But .. I just .. can't . Impossible to explain . Not able to achieve , your love means everything to me .. don't leave . 
--> I seriously am under the impression no one deserves a heart broken into this many little pieces . Ever heard the quote \It only gets better ? \ " Yea .. I hope the person who made that up was killed the most gruesome way possible for lying and filling people with false hope . " 
--> Rofl ! Conversation with my brother . Hilarious . :P Even greater ; Found out something about my boyfriend which only makes him even better ! Lmbo . <3 
--> So mad . Going to go work out and relieve some stress . :\\ 
--> I'm done with you . You lied all the time and then told me you changed .. I was unintelligent enough to give you the benefit of the doubt . You blew your < PROPMALE > , and you're not getting another one . It's people like you that make others afraid to trust . Jerk . 
--> 11 Minutes ago I really liked you . Now I despise you . It's amazing how quick an idiot can screw things over . 
--> I ninja'd < PROPFIRST>'s sweater today . It smells sooo good . I lied when I said I'd give it back in 3rd hour ! I'm never taking it off . :P 
--> Tears are a storm in the heart that rains from the eyes .. 
--> I'm so happy ! Nyaa ! < PROPFEMALE > ! It's perfect ! You're perfect ! Jeez ! Ahh ! Gosh ! :DDDD <3 <3 <3 
--> Eating strawberry oatmeal , and watching Nip/Tuck . I can think of very few things that would make this day better . :) <3 
--> You don't know how hard it is to talk to you and have to hold in the tears . You're not aware of the pain I must keep imprisoned within me . I know what I've done and must accept the consequences ... but NO ONE deserves a heart broken into this many pieces . 
<-- Just got kissed on the cheek ! :P 
<-- kissed on the other cheek ! :P Teeheee . \ 
I need a partner for Mrs. Mock's project ! Anyone else in need of one ? 
--> Was just proposed to ...? O.O Made my day ! Lmbo . Getting ready to go up to my grandfathers house to pass out < PROPFEMALE > for Halloween . Might get to see my hero .. :P Going to be a fun night . <3 < PROPFEMALE > Halloween All . Be safe . Have a Nice Night . 
--> Spent the evening with my grandfather who is hilarious , and a few other family members who add to the laughs . A little girl told me I was pretty and wanted to look like me when she grows up . :P That made my night . I didn't get to go see my hero , but he made sure he came to see me . Which made my week . <3 <3 <3 All in all , great Halloween . Hope everyone ejoyed it as much as I did . 
--> On my way to Shotokan . ?? < PROPFIRST > is hilarious . Lmbo . :D Excited to practice my karate on a cutie pie . It's good to have eye < PROPFEMALE > every where you go . : P 
--> Back from Shotokan . Hilarious night . Best night ever though . < PROPFEMALE > and her driving skills . LMBO !!! Her thought process when she's driving . LOL ! Had to break into my own house to let these fools in because < PROPFEMALE > didn't have my house key ! It's all her fault ! I <3 life . :D 
--> Got kissed on the cheek twice today by my wifey . She's so amazing . :D <3 u < PROPFEMALE > . :D

We have such an amazing band . :D \

--> HIM : You never make me feel bad . But sometimes like I'm drowing when I'm swimming towards you . HER : I'd get the life raft . :) 
--> \I hate pennies . Pennies are the worst currency Americans ever made . How could they put the best President on a < PROPFEMALE > ?! They should put < PROPFIRST > Bush on there instead . \ " < PROPFEMALE > BbyGirl Hope in 2nd hour science . Lmbo .! :P <3 " 
misses her Evanly . And a bunch of other people too .. just .. Evanly a bit more . :D 
is very dissapointed in the Sabres . I'm not going to say good job , because whether I'm being harsh or not , your job wasn't good . Period . You didn't even try . That's a shame . Your heads got too big for your body and you couldn't bring yourself to even barely try . I don't think I've ever been more appauled with anyone . 
--> Family pictures today ! Kind of excited , because our most recent one was when I was like ... 10 . Forboding it because it's a picture .. o . 0 
--> Anticipating tomorrow . :) <3 
-- Dear Kings of < PROPFIRST > , if her Sex is on Fire .. she probably has an STD of some sort . Watch out . 
--> Me : What color hair does she have ? < PROPMALE > ; it's like , a dark brown color . Grandfather ; Yea , she has beautiful hair , too bad it's all under her arms . -- i'll admit , he makes me laugh . ;] 
--> Okay , Family Pictures are today . Excited ! :D Ready to get this done and see how they look ! 
--> Just came back from family pictures . They look amazing . :) Been thinking about a certain someone all night .. finally made a decision I didn't think I would have . 
--> Woohoo . Big decision . Just hope I'll stick with it and follow through this time . Tomorrow will be a big day ... Gah . Night all . <3

--> Nasal Congestion , Coughing , Sore throat , Tummy Ache , and Head Ache . Thanks for getting me sick , Evanly . You're great . -_- 
--> Not feeling well at all . Cleaned earlier .. made me feel a bit better . Hopefully a warm shower will help ..?

--> Gah ! So mad ! Don't get to participate in the tournament today because of reasons unverified . >.< I even went to bed early and everything last night ! Definite total loss . Well .. going to spectate . This should be ... interesting .

--> Kind of really want to watch a horror movie late at night sitting next to my sweetheart . (: 
--> \True love is when you shed a tear and still want her . It's when she ignores you and you still like her . It's when she loves another but you still smile and say \ " I'm happy for you\ " . When all you really can do is cry ... and cry . \"" 
--> Hectic Week ! Karate tests , Mid-Terms , Sports , and on top of all that ... LIFE ! I thought Christmas for a teenager was supposed to be a stress free , gift giving paradise ? Oh , right . I go to Sumner .

--> Just got done curling my hair . Looks like a mess . (: Still going to school with it though .. ' cuz I don't give a crap about what you think . :D <3 
--> Those little words you say are always so easily turned to daggers that puncture my heart . Why do you tell me now ? Bringing us so much closer together , but pushing us further apart ? They say that actions speak louder than words , but do they know how much words can leave a person perturbed ? -Heaven Lottie-Leigh Hanson 
--> You got me ; I've fallen so hard for you darling . I can't get enough , I'm addicted to you . You've got me so caught up , I don't want to stop . If I had my way I'd be with you forever . (: <3

--> She needed a shoulder , and he was there for her . She believed in him . He told her , many a times he would catch her when she fell . He did . Only to be the one to push her to the ground . Now that she's pointed out what he's done , he apologizes . Not from the heart , he only tells her he's sorry to get it over with . Now that she's lost the only one she's trusted , who's left now ? -Heaven Lottie-Leigh Hanson-

--> Off to the library to get a couple books . :D <3 
--> So .. my minds been wandering aimlessly for the past few days and I end up putting myself in exacerbated situations . I need someone to talk to . Someone I won't hurt when I tell them , who won't judge , won't give irrelevant advice .. yet , the only person trusted to do that is myself . You see how that's worked out so far ? 
--> From last night to this morning I've had three friend requests . One , from some buff junky that goes to Wyandotte that I guess some of you know , one from apparently some muscular guy that likes to strip in front of a camera , and one from a ( male ) Turkish Soldier . O.O Anyone know why all these worky-outty guys are trying to add me ? 
--> .. <3 . Jeffree < PROPFEMALE > . <3 ..

--> The shred of innocent intelligence I thought he still had was divested into deviate stupidity . The disappointment of this situation is incredulous . 
--> Since when does U.S.D 500 cancel school ?! We had 2 1/2 weeks off of school , go back for two days , and get three more days off . It's only a little sad to say 2010-2011 Winter Break is lasting WAY too long . 
--> Has six layers of cothing on . ( Kind of hard to type . ) I'm going to go play in the snow with my family . (: 
--> Gotta love cleaning while listening to exaggeratedly loud music . (: 
--> The most amazing short person I know is leaving Sumner . Tomorrow is her last day . I honestly don't know what I'm going to do without her . :( This is a really sad day . I <3 you < PROPFEMALE > Wonsmos Needsanickname you're fantastic . 
--> Why must parents be so irritating ? I mean .. you go from being in a fantastic mood .. and then your father says something like \I want ... \ " and you're just like \ " Crap . \ " >.<" 
--> My brain is flooding , and I find myself drowning beneath the depths of thought . 
--> Gunna be in the beautiful's quince . (: <3 Daddy said \Eww . I can't believe she likes you enough to invite you . Let alone be one of the damas . \ " Lol . :D "

--> Woke up in a cold sweat trying to yell . I woke up from a nightmare . I don't want to go back to sleep . )': 
The hands that cage the heart are a deathgrip . Suffocation , suppression , inertion . The will to break free is no longer there once you realize the only thing you've got left is that cold metal squeezing the life from your beating organ . Yet , you stay . Undefined . Maybe the feeling that something needs you is more powerful than the feeling of freedom . So , my question is : How do you convince yourself to escape ?

--> The real truth ? Really no one on Earth is unique . Humans all think and act the same way . If you're mature at a young age , that's not just you . Someone else you know is the same way . If you think you're the only one who eats what you find in your belly button .. sorry but there's probably someone who does that too .
