My first 24 hours without a cigarette in a very very long time . My birthday present to myself ;-)

1 week smoke free ... and raising another wind generator today ... 
Two weeks tobacco free ... those who are betting the odds are loosing $$$$ LOL 
Three + weeks ! Lots of smoke free experiences . Still have moments when I want a %#^*#}% cigarette ... but so many more moments when I feel enourmous freedom from being a slave to nicotine . Everyday could be the day I slip ... glad it was not today :-}

We need to see all human beings , regardless of their nationality , religion , color , race , and ethnicity as part of our larger family . 
Suddenly it hit me ... my youth has slipped away . At least it feels that way ... any thoughts ? 
What is the sweetest thing anyone has ever said or written to you ?

Are Americans aware of the continued fall of the value of a dollar ? This is < PROPMALE > news here , but I'm guessing the media is widely ignoring it in the U.S. On a global level , the dollar is worth less and less , and we are in a global economy . Any comments ? Anyone care ? I change my dollars as quickly as I get them into another currency ... 
I am loving thiis new phone ... 
The problem with trying to do more than I am capable of is that I always end up disappointing not only myself , but so many others .
