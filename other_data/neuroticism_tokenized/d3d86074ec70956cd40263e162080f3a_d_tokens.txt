Oh now I'm special ? I didn't feel special when I was with you . All i felt was this helplessness , imprisoned by a selfish bitch chew me up and spit me out , I fell for this so many times its ridiculous and still I stick with this . 
I'm sick of this but in my sickness and addiction , you're addictive as the get , evil as they come , vindictive as they make ' em . My friends keep asking me why i can't just walk away from , I'm addictied . To the pain and stress , the drama , I'm drawn in so I guess i'm a mess , cursed and blessed but this time I ain't changin my mind I'm climbin out this abyss . 
finally havin ME time . Sittin at school reading \the innocent mage . \ " thank god for epic novels . "

Been sick for wayyy too long . wish i would get better !! 
When somethings been gone for so long ... sometimes you forget how much you really miss it . And then you remember . Heres to growing up , growing old , growing apart , and making something better for yourself . 
She found out the hard way about him , now shes out to find out how she'll do without him . Her hands shaking , her heart pounding , by the way she's drinkin , his memory's drowning .

She only drinks coffee at midnight when the momment is not right , her timing is quite unusual . <3 
I talk to you for 5 minutes and have the intense urge to smoke . 
I give it all my oxygen , so let the flames begin . Let the flames begin . 
I've got my hands in my pockets and my head in the clouds , this is how I do when I think about you . I never thought that you could break me apart , I keep a sinister smile and a hole in my heart , you want to get inside then you can get in line but not this time . ' Cause you caught me off gaurd , now i'm runnin and screaming . 
damnit im such a procrastinator . 
I've been dying to get out and that might be the death of me . Even though theres no way of knowing where to go , I promise you I'm going because I've gotta get outta here , I'm stuck inside this rut that I fell into by mistake . I've gotta get outta here , and I'm begging you to be my escape . 
I think i'm going to do the unexpected . :) 
I would give you the world ; all you have to do is ask . 
I think i'm going back to the hippie me ; i was much happier then . 
Listening to < PROPMALE > Denkers play guitar . There's always something to do on a rainy day ! :)

A hundred days have made me older since the last time that I saw your pretty face . A thousand lies have made me colder and I don't think I can look at this the same . And all the < PROPMALE > that seperate disappear now when I'm dreaming of your face . I'm here without you baby , but you're still on my lonely mind . I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time . 
Let me just inform everyone on facebook that the cheapest flight that i've found to Cape Town , South Africa is $ 1,700 . Talk about some < PROPMALE > cash .... anyone wanna help me out with this ? 
Im SO done with this . 
All I wanna do is be with you , be with you . There's nothing we can't do , just wanna be with you , only you . No matter where life takes us nothing can break us apart , you know it's true . I just wanna be with you <3

It shouldn't be so hard to keep it together , it shouldn't be so hard to say the right things to you , it shouldn't be so hard just to be effortlessly .

Whatever ... it doesn't matter ... oh well ... we're goin at it tonight , theres a party on the roof top , top of the world tonight , tonight , and we're dancing on the edge of the Hollywood sign .
