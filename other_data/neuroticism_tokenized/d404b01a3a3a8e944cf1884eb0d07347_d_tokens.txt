Adults may say that I am too young to fall in love but I have already found my first love , and my first love is that of music .

Got gold at regionals . Qualified for Semi State :)

Death Note is truly epic ?

I WANT A DEATH NOTE !!! 
I WANT A DEATH NOTE !!!! 
I feel like having a Death Note roleplay 
TMB we all did great today . Although we didn't make it to finals we did have a great season so we have that to be proud of . Hold your heads high with pride guys ! 
Please put this as your status if you know someone , or are related to , someone who was killed on Alderaan when it was obliterated by the Death < PROPFEMALE > . Our wish is that people will understand the Empire is a band of murdering scum . The Rebel Alliance wants to bring peace to the galaxy , ...... but the Galactic Empire continues to kill innocent civilians . ( 93% of people won't copy/paste this into their status ) . 
Pumped to start playing Pep Band music tomorrow ! :) 
Listening to some epic Nightwish

The weekend can't come fast enough 
Hurry up and get here weekend 
The weekend can't seem to get here soon enough and then once the weekend gets here it will go by all too quickly 
YAY weekend ! 
Just watched Kill < PROPMALE > Vol . ' s 1 & 2 , I had forgotten just how awesome those movies were :) 
I have officially discovered how amazing FFVII truly is 
I have finally found a way to win the game , i feel so accomplished :] ( not really and since i mentioned the game i have just lost the game ) 
* sigh * why must the weekend come to and end so soon ? Well at least it will soon be thanksgiving break , and five whole days off of school :) 
I'm not going to name anyone particular or anything but some people just have no morals . Some people don't know the difference between wrong and right and some things some of those people do are just wrong no matter how you look at it . I blame it on this fucked up world 
Wishing today was Tuesday of next week , that way we would be out of school for five whole days . Such a downer that there is still a week to wait for that * sigh * 
Dear < PROPMALE > Potter , i would just like to inform you that you are a pathetic creature , unable to do a thing without your wooden stick , Eragon could kill you a hundred times over before you could do a thing 
Your sweetest dreams turn into tears . It's almost done . They're almost gone . Our darkest days , they fade away . It's almost done . They're almost gone 
I saw you look away \ 
\ 
Is what you've seen too much to take \ 
Or are you blind and seeing nothing , I saw you run \ 
I saw you run away \ 
is what i've done too much to take or are you scared of being nothing \ 
There's a stain on my hand and it's red \ 
oh my god am i losing it \ 
I can't help what i've done or i said \ 
It's the buttons i push ( when she says ) 
OMG , Japan now has a Mobile Suit Gundam combat simulator where you actually sit inside a pod designed like an actual mobile suit cockpit ! 
Auel : \What is she doing back there ? \ " Sting : \ " Playing the part of a ditzy airhead ? That'd be my guess . Why don't you give it a try ? You might like it . \"" 
Goku : Krillin , why didn't you do something ? \ 
Krillin : I was bitch slapped through a house ! What's your excuse ? 
Vegta : Well Nappa , looks like its your turn to teach them a lesson . \ 
Nappa : Yeah , right out of Saiyan University\ 
Vegeta : Hold on , you went to college ? \ 
Nappa : Yup\ 
Vegeta : What the hell could someone like you possibly < PROPMALE > in ? \ 
Nappa : Child Psychology . \ 
Gohan : Wow , that sounds really interest-\ 
Nappa : WITH A MINOR IN PAIN ! -punches Tenshinhan's arm off- 
Watching Shrek , followed by Shrek 2 
ZGMF-X20A 
Is so pumped for the first basketball game tonight , which means pep band ! 
I have just found out unlimited frustuation that is bred by patches and updates and some file called winRAR and such other things . Damned nuisances , why can't it all just be one single file with everything in it ? 
Atra gulai < PROPFEMALE > ilian taughr ono < PROPFEMALE > atra ono waise skoliro fra rathr 
Skulblaka , eka celöbra ono < PROPFEMALE > malabra ono < PROPFEMALE > onr Shur'tugal né haina . Atra nosu waíse fricai . 
I WANT THE FOURTH ERAGON BOOK TO BE OUT NOW !!!!! I'M SICK OF WAITING FOR IT I JUST WANT TO FINALLY BE ABLE TO READ IT ! < PROPFIRST > PAOLINI HURRY THE HELL UP AND FINISH THE DAMN BOOK SO WE CAN ALL READ IT !!! 
Ugh trying to find a website to roleplay on but with no luck . Anyone got any suggestions ? 
Does anyone have a Gaia account ( www.gaiaonline.com ) 
Ugh I hate that my profile picture is too wide to fit into the small box that it is shown in . The only place I can see my full profile picture is in my profile 
I just finished reading Brisingr ( again ) at the end when Oromis was killed and when Glaedr's body was killed I nearly cried , even though I knew it was going to happen . 
Kids with special needs aren't sick or gross or stupid , and their handicap is not contagious . They only want what we all want : to be accepted and loved . Can I make a request : is anyone willing to post this and leave it as your status for at least an hour ? It is Special Education Week . 
Nappa : \Hey Vegeta can we stop at that bug planet ? \ " \ 
One more day until the weekend ! Fuck yeah ! 
Snow snow and more snow . I used to like snow but these days it seems just plain annoying 
Everyone is putting their profile picture as their favorite cartoon character from their childhood so I have a question , do Pokemon count ? 
XXXG-OOWO can anyone tell me what that set of letters goes to ? 
Waiting for people to get online . I hate waiting 
Had fun today :) Hopefully tomorrow will be just as good :D 
Just downloaded The World 2d !!!!! 
Downloaded and playing The World 2d :) 
Having a fun Kingdom Hearts roleplay :) 
Oh yeah , Hades profile picture ! :D 
Everyone hope for school to be closed tomorrow ! 
Name's Hades , Lord of the dead . Hi , how ya doin' ? 
There need to be more hours in a day . The time we have available just isn't enough to get enough done ..... -This message paid for by the \Vote for Hades as new President\ " Foundation " 
Most people have 1000 wishes for Christmas ; a cancer patient only has one , to get better . I know 97% of you won't repost this to your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do . In honor of someone who has died , or is still fighting , or survived cancer , copy this to your status . 
I HATE THE INTERNET WHEN IT DOESN'T WORK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Only two more school days until Christmas Break ! 
-Lone < PROPFEMALE > and Dark Helmet getting ready to duel with their Shwartz blades-\ 
Dark Helmet : Ah Lone < PROPFEMALE > I see your Shwartz is just as big as mine 
Heh Heh only posted my RP a little over an hour ago and already two other people have joined :D 
Devil May Cry 5 is such bullshit ! In DMC5 < PROPMALE > has black , short hair , and smokes . < PROPMALE > does not have short black hair and doesn't smoke ! They butcher < PROPMALE > in that game ! 
Listening to \Jingle Bombs\ " being < PROPFIRST > by Achmed The Dead Terrorist :D " 
There's a douche bag hiding in the rocks with a radioactive twinkie ! 
< PROPFEMALE > CHRISTMAS < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Almost Christmas :D 
Can't wait for the basketball game tonight . It's gonna be great :D 
Downloaded Youtube Downloader 
Facebook needs a ' dislike ' button 
Is it just me or does it seem that there are more people on Facebook late at night than any other time ? 
What's this about Facebook shutting down ? 
Ugh damn download is taking forever . Why does it take an hour to download a ten minute music video from youtube !?!?!? 
Nothing is happening on Facebook tonight . Ah fuck this I'm going to go read some manga . 
I want a pair of AT's . 
Well the heater in the house isn't working D: 
Air Gear needs a video game 
Four finals to do tomorrow and a two hour delay so it'll most likely end up one final right after the other . Ugh , my brain is going to be soooo fried after tomorrow .... 
Well we have school for the first time in two days . And we have four finals to do today ....... fuck ....... well let's just get this over with ........ D: 
Three finals left tomorrow then a three day weekend . Can't wait ! 
School tomorrow , finals , ugh . Basketball game after school . Three day weekend . Ugh . I'm ready to graduate . 
ARGH ! The stupid choir at halftime was playing GAY FAGGOT < PROPFIRST > BIEBER SHIT ! * shoots myself out of the humiliation to all music due to that faggot music being played * 
Wants a pair of Inline skates . 
Three day weekend is coming to an end which means I have school tomorrow . * sigh * 
Nothing to do . Fuck it I'm going to bed . 
News says we're supposed to be getting up to six inches of snow tonight ... 
It would be amazing if school got canceled tomorrow :D 
I am in the mood for Toast with butter and cinnamon spread on top :D 
I was excited this morning when I found out we had a delay but then I saw on the news that school was closed and I literally jumped into the air and shouted \Fuck yeah ! \ " lols " 
Anyone who wants school to be canceled tomorrow , LIKE this status ! Let's see how many we can get ! 
Listening to Nightwish . 
Ok so everyone was hoping school would get canceled today . It didn't . Everyone is hoping school will get canceled tomorrow . Judging from yesterday I'm not getting my hopes up . 
Watched Iron Man . Love that movie . :D 
\I doubt we will be at school tomorrow\ " - Mr. McFarland\ 
Iron Man is an amazing movie . < PROPFIRST > Stark invented Beast Mode and the Epic Win :D 
Well people this is it for the night . Will tomorrow bring a full school day ? Will it bring a school day with a two hour delay ? Or will it bring a day of no school ? We'll find out in the morning . 
Should be a good weekend . If all goes well will have < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > over tomorrow to play some Left 4 Dead . :D 
The biggest thing I will miss after graduation is the Trojan Marching Band . I love that organization and if I had the < PROPMALE > to do all my four years with the TMB over again I would do it in a hearbeat . I'll miss the TMB so much . 
Does anyone know a good website for sheet music ? 
Should be a good weekend . Plan on having < PROPFIRST > over to play some Left 4 Dead :D . If my cousin is home from college might get some friends and go to his place and play some Black Ops split screen multiplayer . 
I swear more people are on Facebook late at night than at any other time . 
Watching Deadliest Warrior :D 
Idiots that say things thinking they're smart are so funny . Lmfao . 
Freshmen ......... Ugh * facepalm * why do freshmen exist ? Just leave the freshmen with the seventh and eighth graders so the Sophomore's , < PROPMALE>'s , and Senior's don't have to deal with them . 
One of the funniest days of my life happened Thursday . I discovered that my parents do not know what pwn and facepalm are XD 
Nothing happening on Facebook ..... BORING .... 
Needs to go to the skating rink sometime in the next week or two . 
Fuck . I need Inline skates . 
This world will never be what I expected , and if I don't belong who would've guessed it . I will not leave alone everything that I own to make you feel like , it's not too late . It's never too late . 
On the ground I lay , motionless in pain . I can see my life , flashing before my eyes . 
I LOVE PENGUINS ! 
Either no one is posting or Gaia is fucking up . Either way it's pissing me off . 
End of day announcements , Gus : \The freshmen count stands at negative thirty six dollars . \ " Haha the freshmen are royally screwed . I doubt they have any < PROPMALE > of winning now . " 
Three Days Grace = Greatest band of all time . 
After three years of hating the series I'm starting to get interested in Naruto again . 
Just got the beta 10 of Firefox 4.0 :) 
........ really don't feel like doing anything at all ........... not even sleeping ........... what a terrible end to a day ............. 
Got an ice storm today and tomorrow . Might not have school either day . That would be nice . Might lose power . That would NOT be nice . All we can do is hope for the best . 
Wow ....... school's canceled and it's not even Tuesday morning at seven forty five with everyone already at school ......... what a rarity .......... 
Attempting to apply for Ball State University . 
Just finished my application for Ball State University . Just have to wait to mail it in with the application fee . :D 
The internet is being so damn slow . Probably because of the weather . 
Well school is canceled for tomorrow . The only thing I HAD to do these two days was apply for Ball State , which I finished . Now I have all of today and tomorrow to enjoy the snow days . Sometimes life is great :D 
At this rate we won't be going to school again until next Monday . Oh well . Enjoy the time off while we've got it ! 
More snow and ice . If this keeps up we're going to be stuck in our homes until next summer . 
No school tomorrow ......... again . 
Maybe the ISSMA contest site will get an ice storm today and the contest date will get pushed to next Saturday ....... not likely , but it would be nice . 
I hate hackers . They're such douche bags . 
I believe in the right to keep and bear arms . One Facebooker has challenged all gun owners to put this on their wall . The Supreme Court of the United States has affirmed that the right to keep and bear arms is a fundamental right of the individual . If you Believe in the 2nd Amendment and you are not afraid to show it , re-post this . 
Two hour delay tomorrow . This will make the first day since last Monday that we've went to school . 
Wouldn't be surprised if another ice storm popped up tonight and canceled school for the rest of the week . There are just some weeks you wish you could repeat over and over , last week , only having one day of school , was one of those weeks . 
Word going around is that the school may decide to have school for five Saturdays in order to make up the days we missed . Grrrrrrrrrr ..... 
Anyone who knows Naruto series ; Sharingan , Rinnegan , or Byakugan , which would you choose ? 
Feels like reading the Death Note manga again . 
Been about a week since I last got online . I have now found out how truly addicting Call Of Duty : Black Ops is . 
It's been almost a whole week since I was online at all . And people say teenagers are addicted to Facebook ? Lies , I say . 
Why does Senior Night , the last basketball game of the year , have to be one of the games where we leave after half time ? Does Middleton not know how much the band members ( at least the one's I know ) love One More Time < PROPMALE > Corea ? Argh !!!!! 
The world is full of idiots . Prime example ; as I was driving through the parking lot after school today some idiot kid ( it was Malaki Stevens ) thought he'd be ' funny ' and pretended to jump in front of my car . Then when I slammed the brakes and glared at him he flipped me off like it was all my fault to begin with . 
You would think that the senior class would be the smartest but , unfortunately , it seems like the senior class has more idiots than any other class in the school . 
Stupid weather . Having school closed is the last damn thing we need . 
Stupid home internet isn't working . Until it starts working again , which could be lord knows how long , I'll have to go to the library to get online . Ugh . 
Facebook , why does it exist ? Anyone else ever wondered this ? 
\Ral : Can she come with us ? \ 
Listening to Pandora :D 
My new favorite manga : Blue Dragon - Ral Grad\ 
My new favorite song : Sevens by < PROPFIRST > R . Hazo 
I really wish Blue Dragon - Ral Grad was a longer series . I mean , only four volumes ? It's easily my favorite series but it would've been so much better if it was longer . 
What a waste of a day . 
Finally gonna get to shoot the double barrel shotgun tomorrow ! Can't wait ! 
Grammar is important . Capital letters are the difference between helping your Uncle < PROPFIRST > off a horse , and helping your uncle < PROPFIRST > off a horse . :D 
< PROPFIRST > Sheen 47 , is all over the news because he's a celebrity drug addict . While < PROPFIRST > Wilfahrt 31 , < PROPFIRST > Tabada 21 , < PROPMALE > Hizon 22 , Chauncy Mays 25 are all soldiers who gave their lives this week with no media mention . Honor THEM by re-posting this status . God Bless all our troops , past and present !!! 
Only four hours until the weekend is over = goof off for three hours and spend the last hour cramming in all the work you should've done all weekend . 
Fuck . Weekend is officially over once I log off and go to bed , then another week of school . Well there's hope , might get to go shooting at the range Tuesday . Hope there's no idiots there who walk down range when people are still shooting . DUMBASSES ! 
Spring Break can't come soon enough . 
Going to McDonalds after school tomorrow with < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > Wilkinson , < PROPMALE > Durham , < PROPFIRST > Garner , and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > . Afterwards we ( might ) go goof off at Baker Park . Heh heh . 
< PROPFIRST > Figerou , you are on my hate list for the next hour , as you bought the first volume of Blue Dragon - Ral Grad and that was the only copy the store had of any of the entire manga . :| 
Only two days of school left until the weekend . :D 
Internet at home isn't working , have to come to the library to get online . * sigh * Sometimes the internet is nothing more than a damn hassle . 
At this point I don't care what anyone says , I'm going to the range and going shooting Saturday . Otherwise I'm going to explode . 
Found a new Wi-Fi signal to use from home . Hopefully this one doesn't fuck up and stop working on me . 
I have the longing to play my old Pokemon < PROPFEMALE > Version now ... 
Might have to wait to go shooting until Spring Break . Ugh . 
Finally only one more day until Spring Break . 
Spring Break ! HELL FUCKING YES !
