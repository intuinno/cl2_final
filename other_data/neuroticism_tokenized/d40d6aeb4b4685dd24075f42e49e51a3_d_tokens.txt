Darnit . It's taking like , half an hour to download these episodes of NCIS and I'm downloading 26 of them ... itunes sucks ... 

The captcha when I signed up read \ Mr. Cancan \"." 
can't decide whether to take the discreet little binoculars or the big ridiculous binoculars to Cruefest ... hehe ... 
Oh my god that was amazing ... the best day of my life . 
Do you take sugar ? One lump or two ? 
Love Song has been stuck in my head all day- darnit , Tesla ! 
There is a bird living in my mother's fuscias- we have named him < PROPMALE > . 
There are baby birds in the fuscia ! Oh ... I guess that means < PROPMALE>'s a girl ... oops . 
is dying of epic boredom . 
couldn't help but jump on the mattress on the floor ... now my back hurts again . Where's that ice pack ?! 
has a lazy as that worsens as she becomes tired , making her look drugged . :/ 
luvs Faster Pussycat ! ~ Poison < PROPFEMALE > , you come creepin uo right behind me ... ~

has been listening to a lot of Toxic Holocaust lately . NUKE THE CROSS ! 
is at < PROPFEMALE>'s . Mmm , pizza pockets . 
has imaginary pants 
accidentally just said her sister was turning september in a month xD I fell on the floor and laughed so hard it hurt . 
was about to go to bed yesterday when she discovered a spider in her room , so she directed the cat and dog to that general area in hopes that they would eat it , and RAN . I'm not sure if they did , or if the 3 hours of half-sleep I got were worth anything . 
realized she looks like a little baby < PROPFEMALE > Ford . 
if I found a lion in my closet , would I be on the news ? 
wants to play Go Fish with a sheep ... 
feels like a total idiot ... I bought Sims 3 without looking at the system requirements , and it turns out our processor isn't good enough and it won't run . There goes 40 bucks ... 
don't take life too seriously ... no one gets out alive anyway 
' s cat proceeded to sit upon my calves and bathe herself , then lick my feet , at approximately 1 a.m. There was nothing I could do about it because the state of my back prevented me from sitting up . 
If home is where the heart is , wouldn't that mean home is in my chest cavity ? 
is fighting back tears ... oh man ... listened to Fly to the Angels and it reminded me of < PROPMALE > . 
Phew ! Just cleaned the carpets ... boy did they need it ! I saw that darn spider again ... disappeared before I could vacuum him up , so I sprayed the area with enough febreze to hopefully kill it . 
bought a bunch of pink baby decor on sims , but then the baby was a boy ... oops . 
can't wait to go out to breakfast tomorrow !! DO YOU LIKE WAFFLES ?? 
feels like she has been hit by a truck . 
what part of cheeseballsnizletteflorgencookies don't you understand ? 
needs to take a shower ... badly ... but there are people over .... 
HELP ME .... I JUST SAW THE BIGGEST EFFING SPIDER I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE ... I KNOW I SHOULD VACUUM IT UP , BUT I'M AFRAID IT'LL START RUNNING , AND IF IT DOES , I'LL BE HALFWAY ACROSS THE HOUSE BEFORE I KNOW IT ... BUT I HAVE TO GET RID OF IT BEFORE MOM GETS HOME BECAUSE IT'S RIGHT BY THE FRONT DOOR AND SHE'LL SCARE IT INTO HIDING WHEN SHE COMES IN THE DOOR ... 
phew ... < PROPMALE > got the spider ... 
is going shopping at Southcenter ! Yay ! I'll try not to get shot . 
just realized she only has 6 gigs left on her 120 gig zune . Time to clean out the cobwebs in my collection ... 
gettin my hair cut today . :) 
is so happy ... I wish I could go back to 6th grade and tell myself that the person I've always wanted to be has always been in me , I just needed to let her spread her wings . 
Is it live or is it Memorex ? That is the question . 
Mmm , blizzard . 
Songs I'm currently addicted to : Fighters Fear- Jetboy , Love Made Me- Vixen , Arclight- Deathstars . 
is hungry and has a Bon Jovi song stuck in her head . 
I feel like I've been hiding this from a lot of you , so here goes . My sister , < PROPFEMALE > , a high school senior , has cancer . She is going to be okay , but is going through a lot of pain and hard times . She needs our support and prayer to get through this . 
CHEEZ-ITS ! CHEEZ-ITS ! WHERE'S MY ORANGE SODA ?! 
has one question for you people : * NSYNC or Backstreet Boys ? 
is so not getting the new Zune . 32 gigs ? Yeah right ! I'd need 3 of those to hold all my stuff ! 
Woooow . Just cleansed my Zune of all the crap I never listen to , videos I never watch , and pictures I never look at ... got rid of a whole 25 gigs of stuff . 
just watched an episode of < PROPFEMALE > ... I never realized how terribly codependent she is ! Every single thing has to be pointed out for her , and she always needs help with everything she does ! She can't even reach those stubby arms back to her backpack to get The Map ! 
Anyone got a locker in a sensible place that they are willing to share ? I didn't get one . Could have taken my sister's but it's at the far end of the second floor and it also doesn't open . 
Chicken-flavored crakers = best idea ever ... 
went to the chiropractor . My back is more messed up than I thought ... my muscles are unbalanced , and I may have scoliosis . I always thought I might because my spine kind curves wierdly , but the people who test us at school always said I was fine . Figures ... idiots . Most likely , the school doesn't want to pay for actual nurses , so they grab quacks of the street to do the testing . 
' s legs hurt . I walked down to Safeway to buy < PROPFEMALE > for < PROPFEMALE > and I . :) 
' s favorite word today is chumblebee . 
YUS ! I GOT CHICKEN IN A BISKIT !!! 
looked up the base salary for her career goal as a pedatric nurse . Turns out , the LOWEST 10% of nurses earn under 43k and that has been growing , and those with 10+ years of experience can earn 60-100k ( although I do keep in mind that 6 fig is an upper EXTREME ) . I think I'll be able to live off that just fine ... hehe ... 
Schadenfreude . 
There's NO WAY I'm going to Freshman Lock-In ! I have way better things to do than be locked in a school until 2 am ... 
listening to Vains Of < PROPFEMALE>'s new album ... awesome ! 
MUST GO PLAY CHUZZLE ... 
went to the chiropractor ... so I don't have scoliosis , but my neck has no curve and is angled 6.4 cm forward , and the bone at the bottom of my spine ( forgot what it's called ; starts with an s ) is tilted too far up , however ; she says she can have all of this fixed in a few months . 
Can't wait to see < PROPFEMALE > for the first time in forever today ! 
CRAPSNACKS ! Already having problems with the new Zune software ... either that or mom just doesn't know her password very well ... 
Love made me blind to the truth/Love made me crawl , I should have stood up to you/Love made me cry out your name/So what's so good about love if it hurts you this way ? 
wrote a really cheesy poem , do you guys want to see it ? 
was just watching HSN when the woman reffered to the traction nubs on the sole of the shoes she was selling as \nipples\ " . LOL . " 
Argh ... I finally get some time alone , so I jumped around the kitchen dancing and rawring and just generally making a lot of noise , then I see < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > walking up the driveway . Can't I get 2 mintues of gawddamn peace ? 
finally gets some peace n quiet . oh wait , did I say QUIET ? I meant it WAS quiet until I turned into a < PROPMALE > ! But I occasionally misjudged the trajectory of my < PROPMALE > attack and bumped into a few things ... hard ... Hmm . In retrospect , that all seems highly abnormal ... maybe there's something in the well water here ... oh well , i don't really get any excersize aside from these neurotic spaz attacks , so I whatever . 
holy crap , why have I been so bipolar today ? I think I'm going totally freaking insane . 
Sooo ... what's up with you people today ? 
the dogs in my neighborhood must be hippies ... they're always out in the open , gettin ' it on ...

' s mother is in the kitchen singing Stairway to Heaven ... not okay ... 
somehow , when we were in the car on the way to the chiropractor , mom's purse strap got tangled up in < PROPFEMALE>'s bra that was for some reason in the car . If I wouldn't have pointed it out , she would have walked into the office with a bra on her purse . 
Happy-ish is the tummy that is full of milkshake .
