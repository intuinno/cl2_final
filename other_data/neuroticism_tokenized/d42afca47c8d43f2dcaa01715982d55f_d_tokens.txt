felt like i just wasted like 2 hours of my time at the convocation for engineering 
well first day of classes pretty much blowed 
well my second day of classes were still boring , but at least all my professors showed up and actually did something productive , even thought they are teaching me basic chem . 
so i am taking physics 1 for the third time or something like that , but i think i might enjoy it because the professor seems to be out their so i should be entertained , but the course will be so boring :( 
is anyone playing/up for tennis today/tomorrow ?????? 
anyone playing tennis today ??? 
2 hour breaks between classes really blow , and this is how i spend my time in between those classes , this is really great 
good luck to all those that are returning to that crappy school called sphs , for the ones that i care about and if you dont know who that is you can send me a msg , i hope that you survive , also i am feeling like in the genrous type of mood so if any of you guys want to know some < PROPFEMALE > ng about me < PROPFEMALE > is the time to ask , just send it to my inbox 
my classes tomorrow are going to be a pain , i am only going to be in class for like 10-20 minutes maybe , and then spend like 40 minutes or so commuting , its like why bother going to class 
well i just finished writing my paper , i shoudl proof read it , but i think since it is just a rough draft that i will just let it go 
tennis tomorrow at 2 at spring lake , be their or be square 
trying to kill 4 hours between classes , this really blows

finished my computer project without any problems !!!! finally something in that class works the way its suppose to

out of curiousity , how many people believe that i should be at a better school than rutgers , and that i am smarter than i let on to be ??? 
2 finals and 4 more days till i am free for winter break , Why cant the 21st come faster ?? 
95 on my calc final !!!!!!!! 
Last final for this semester at 4 , i cant wait to finally be done with school for a month 
No more Finals !!!!!!!! 
Today is a day to remember the true meaning of Christmas . Christmas is not about getting presents or anything of what the holiday stands for today . It is about giving your heart , mind , and soul to the world and to the ones that you care for the most . Be extra kind to everyone you meet today . Most importantly today is meant to be spent with family , and to have some fun . Happy Holidays everyone ! 
i feel like i need to play tennis right about now . It has been way to long since i played . i am going through withdraw symptoms 
Today is a day to be with your significant other . Don't spend money on a useless store product , instead show your significant other what he/she truly means to you . This is worth more than diamonds because your gift will be priceless and your significant other will love it so much more because it came from the heart . Happy < PROPFIRST>'s Day . 
is really pissed off that i cant enjoy the nice weather because i have chem lab at 1:40 to 4:40 , this class is going to be a real pain in the butt 
My dumb chem lab just ruined a perfectly good tennis day , and i so wanted to play tennis since it has been months since i stepped onto a court . CURSE YOU CHEMISTRY !!!!!!!! 
had such a great day , enjoyed the great weather , played tennis for the first time in like 3 month(even improved some once i got back into it , if you can believe that ) , and know its the weekend 
I believe in Jesus Christ and have accepted him as my personal Savior . One Facebooker has challenged all believers to put this on their wall ... In the Bible it says , if you deny me in front of your peers , I will deny you before my Father at The Gates of Heaven . This is simple ... If you love God and you are not afraid to show it , repost this . Just copy and paste . ... no shame here !! 
first bunch of my first mid-terms are finally over , i get a break from all my exams till about tuesday :( , why can't it be spring break already , i am so tired of this school crap(it is taking up way to much time ) 
this week was way too long after i had the monday exam , and right now , mainly because chem lab is just such a pain in the but , i am wishing it was spring break tomorrow , unfortunetly it is not for another 2 weeks :( 
had another great day of playing tennis for about 4 hours !!!!! i love this nice weather , please don't go away 
heading to the tennis courts if anyone wants to meet up with me 
its a real shame that i could not play tennis in the best weather we had this year , but this spring break was not a complete washout , did about 14 hours of tennis in the course of 4 days 
had a great day of tennis , and am looking for another great day tomorrow , this has been a decent spring break(6 out of the 9 days were full of tennis) !!!!!! XD 
its really funny how you could go from such a great day before and than have it ruined because of a stupid moron
