Ok I have updated this < PROPFEMALE > again !...... Everydayhemingway had a great show last night at < PROPMALE>'s! Then a few of us went over to pudges and saw Soul Circus and met some new friends . Had a very cool night last nite ! 

Well today is a day of rest and relaxation . Let's see , think I'll wash clothes , ride my bike to the gym , workout , ride back , take a shower , maybe go shoppin for something to put on these walls of my new apartment , ( which I haven't done since I moved in ) go to a church service tonight , and get ready for the work week . Hmmm what happened to my R&R ? 
Monday morning ... it is what it is . Had a great weekend of fun , but now it`s time to start a new week . Let`s hope the week is as good as the weekend ! P.S. thank you Lord for givin me another day ! 
Wow I have been busier than a 3 legged cat in a litter box ! When`s break time ? 
Woo hoo been invited to run around a little tonight . Might go try and sit in and jam with someone .... see u guys later on tonight . 
Oh man what a great nite ! What a blast ! 
It sure is nice to be able to sit down a while here at work and take a break . The beginning of this week we were swamped ! With 2 forklifts down its been \HELLo operator . \ " I guess as the saying goes ... you have to accept things when they go bad to appreciate when they go good . " 
C`mon 5 o`clock ...... 
Happy Mother's Day ! 
Got a bunch of stuff done today . Got up early and rode my bike to work out this morning . Thats 2 < PROPMALE > there , workout on the eliptical , then rode back . I felt like I did something ! I know my legs will prolly feel it soon . Got wash done , cleaned my apartment , and I think I'm going to cook some mexican food here in a sec . Today I hung-out with me , had alot to think about , I think I'm moving in the right direction ... 
I guess we can wear white shoes now ? Happy Memorial day ! I'm off tommorrow ... oh it's so nice ! Then back to the grind . UG ! Don't want to think about it . 
One of the best things about getting home in the evening is emptying your pockets and knowing you can leave all of that junk there till tommorrow . 
As I sit here having an afternoon snack of peanut butter and crackers , my mind wonders to a quote I heard somewhere ... \Nothing takes the taste out of peanut butter quite like unrequited love . \ " :) " 
I'm excited ! The girls are coming over soon ! Wonder whats taking them so long ? 
Sitting by the pool ... oh wow man , I love the apartments I live in ! Thank you Lord for summer ! 
Making enchiritos as I type ... is that how you spell it ? I'm not Mexican ! So I gave it a shot . But I do love Mexican food ! Don't you wish you were here ? 
A friend is someone who understands your past , believes in your future , and accepts you just the way you are ... Thank you to all my friends who have shared time and thoughts with me . You are special ! :) 
Looks like rain ? Looks like a tornado ? As I sit here on the dock at work makes me wonder if I`ll be blown away ! 
Ahhhh The smell of rain ... I love things that are beautiful :) 
Thats so precious .... 
Excited about going out with friends tonight and seeing \The stiff necked fools . \ " These guys kick < PROPMALE > a** ! The music and grooves are just down right delicious ! Come out and see me get my inner rastah out ! :) " 
For those of you wondering what the asteriks stand for in my last post , x , and e . AXE ... they have a real good gee-tar picker ! :) 
Wow what to write ... haven`t updated in a while . Been busy ... I just want all my friends , buds , family , and pals to know that I do think about you ... and I love you guys ! :) 
Love is the funeral of hearts . Falling in love is the quickest way to kill your heart because then it`s not yours anymore . It is laid into another person`s hands , waiting to be cremated by passion . 
I tried to think of something profound and life changing to say ... But all I could come up with is this ... Take this job and shove it , I ain`t workin` here no more ! 
I have learned some very important information today ... A hippo`s milk is pink and a duck`s quack will not < PROPFEMALE > . 
Don`t try to fool me ... real eyes realize real lies . 
Ahhh Monday ... the day is what you make it I guess . I can hate and get angry about the things that go on this morning , or I can let it go and just let it roll off my back . I don`t want to go in the madhouse , I want to spread love , joy , and peace . Is it possible ? We will see ... 
It seems you always want what you can`t have ... 
Life is what you make of it , and right now , my life is purty good . :) 
I`m feelin good in the neighborhood ... and I`m not at appleby`s . :) 
Going to practice with the \metal gods\ " tonight . A project called split theory . Bring on the double bass chops ! dugadugadugadugaduga crack ! " 
Wow music must be in my blood today .... going to a mini woodstock at the naked bean cafe ' . Starts at six , be there ! 
What a weekend ... my girls stayed with me . We went swimming , < PROPMALE > out with friends , jammed with friends , just had an awesome time 
Thank the good Lord in heaven for a/c ! My God it`s hot today ! 
Am I always supposed to do everything right ? Hey I`m human , I make mistakes ! And usually give everyone the benefit of a doubt . So please , give me the same courtesy . 
Awesome blues jam at Lee`s last night ! There are some incredible musicians in Shreveport . :) 
I just got stung by a yellow jacket ! He was in my work glove . Omg ! it hurt ! He let me know real quick he didn`t lilke my hand in his glove . And to all you macho guys that think I`m a winey baby .... kiss my arse ! :) 
There are two things that happened today that is really nice . Working in the 90s compared to the 100s is great . There is a nice cool breeze today that is just wonderful . I was asked to play tonight at Terry`s in < PROPMALE > . My life is good , working hard in the day , and playin` in the night . :) 
Sometimes I want to copy someone else`s status , word for word , just to see if they notice . 
The weekend went by way to fast . Had a blast though ! My sweet daughters always make my weekends better ! :) 
Someday I will see , beyond what is in front of me , and someday I will hear whispers that are no where near ... 
Im wound up like like an alarm clock . Just lying here listening to some tunes . Conteplating life . Can`t sleep for some reason . Oh oh ... that box of Raisin Bran is calling me ... Do you hear it ? 
AAaahhh ! What a lunch . When ol` Colonel Sanders started slangin` chicken back in the `50s he knew what he was doin` huh ? My chicken was greasalicious ! :) 
Life is a giggle ! :) 
The clothes go round and round ... Have time to reflect , the show I played with the Honky Tonk Drifters was great ! < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , you guys are the best ! Thanks for the dance < PROPFEMALE > ! Yesterday was just a great day and an incredible night . :) 
Awesome time with friends today .... Hung out with my best friend from Texarkana . Ate till I was going to pop ! Oh YEA ! Off tomorrow . How sweet it is . 
What are you supposed to tell someone when they feel they are stagnating in life ? Aren`t we all ? I do the same things everyday ... I just make sure I keep moving . That way I can`t stagnate . 
Good night yall ! 
Saturday ... and making mexican dinner . I love the weekends ! Life is good man :) 
Enjoyed spending time with my girls this weekend . I love you two so much ! Thanks for the fun ! 
Sitting in my lawn chair eating ice cream and watching life go by . Solitude never has anything to say . Quiet times are the best :) 
It`s so nice this morning . It`s going to be a beautiful day . Oh , Tuesday mornings how I love thee ... because your name starts with a T . 
Lord , I was born with a suitcase in my hand . Livin ' in a life that few could understand . Sometimes it gets so confusing , that I don't know where I am . But I always know who I'm with .... I'm with the band . 
The Honky Tonk Drifters will be playing Saturday night in Crocket , Texas . If any of you are going to < PROPMALE > for the weekend , and want to hear some outlaw country at it`s best , msg me and I`ll get you directions . We will be turnin` the guitars up to 11 around 8pm . 
Get your motor runnin` head out on the highway . Lookin` for adventure , what ever comes our way ! :) 
I spend nights alone , wondrin ' what to do , I have hard times , but that bottle always pulls me through , I wake each day to the same sad truth ... How could you walk away ? Like we never met before ? Is love a game you play ? Don't I matter anymore ? How could you walk away ? You left me standin ' all alone , I feel like an outcast stray ... who don't have a home . 
I love being EMO on facebook lol :) 
Lloyds BBQ is the bomb ! If you haven't tasted this taste < PROPMALE > tantalizer ... you are really missin ' out . 
@ work and it`s raining . This is going to be a S L O W .... day . Well at least I have had time to tell you whats on my mind . 
Just got back from < PROPFIRST > and the race , it was awesome ! Had a really good time ! 
\There`s only two things in life that make it worth livin` ... That`s guitars that tune good and firm feelin` women \"~ < PROPMALE > Jennings " 
3 things worth fighting for ... Her respect , your community , and a job worthy of your time . Now ... put that in your pipe and smoke it ! 
So I'm being Mr. Clean today .... laundry , cleaning that awful microwave ( ugg ) , dusting , vacuuming , ( is that spelled right ? ) sweeping , mopping . I guess I owe it to the women that take care of thier men by doing these things ! So housewives and women who work and clean house , I raise my glass to you ! This is alot of friggin ' work ! 
Went riding yesterday afternoon with a friend of mine . Went down to the old municipal auditorium where < PROPMALE > Presley got his start . Thanks < PROPMALE > for the great afternoon ! 
To all my Arkansas friends ... I`m goin to stir a lil up ... the LSU Tigers are comin` your way ! I don`t think Ya`ll be ready Staturday ... Goeux Tigers ! :) 
Being a rebel , a hero of my own cause , and going against the grain is something your born with . How is that working out for me ? Well , I`m pretty dang happy ! How bout you ?

Drinkin` was forbidden in my christian country home , I learned to play the fla t-t op on those good ol` gospel songs ... then I heard about the bar rooms just across the < PROPFEMALE > line , where a boy could make some money playin` DRUMZ late at night . :) 
Looking at all the gift boxes on the shelves , you see one , in your favorite colored wrapping paper . Isn`t it great when you open it , and it has everything you want inside ? Yea man .... the whole package deal ! 
Mmmmmm ! With a blast of citrus flavor ! Citrusy ! Look @ the fizz ! The fizz means it`s wor-kin` ! 
Why is it that my best sleeping time is between my alarm going off and me hitting the snooze button ? Oh it`s heavenly ! But now I really have to get up :( 
The wind is cold on my face . Cheeks red , nose runnin ' , and the coffee is hot . :) 
Having fun in Clairs at the mall . You guys like my new hat and shades ? lol

Again to all my friends and loved ones , I don't want you guys to think Im just writing a generic thank you to all the birthday wishes . I could comment back on each and every individual wish , but that wouldn't be generic enough . :) 
Guys .... I had the most wonderful birthday ! Thank you again for ALL the birthday wishes . From the card at work , to the card I got from my GF ... From the phone call from my mom , to the dinner at Salt Grass Steakhouse . ( Thank you SO much , < PROPFEMALE > ) \It was the BEST day ever ! \ " :) " 
Have you ever been so tired of it all that you just want to get on your bad motorscooter and ride ? Just get on , and never look back ? 
Today the wind is blowing just right for flying a kite . Its beautiful outside today . ( could be a < PROPMALE > warmer ) Anybody wanna stick it to the man and go fly one ? 
Getting ready for the yellow and black attack ! March 16th , 7pm at the Trees in Deep Ellum . < PROPFIRST > , Tx . Going to get my Jesus Rock on ! 
No matter how stressful life gets , no matter how angry you are , always remember that a little rebellion now and then never hurt anyone .... 
Just finished eating @ Cane's with a hottie . So glad I have a bestfriend that's also my girlfriend . Your the best < PROPFEMALE > . ( and no this isn't an April fools joke )
