The beast has been slain , and the party is over . SLeep is GoinG tO Be gREat 
Just got my streetlight ticket for july 11th at Slims , its been too long since I've been to a concert . 
Leaving for Oregon to see my grandma for the 4th of july . Be gone until next monday 
Fuck yeah wearing slippers all day 
Ah man , I haven't checked my FB all day and it's super overwhelming to see all these passionate birthday wishes . It makes me feel indescribably warm and cuddly inside . I would personally respond to all of you guys but I'm afraid they would start to sound generic , and you guys are too awesome for something so mainstream as generic . Also I'm lazy . \ 
Anyways thank you everybody , you make me happy :3 
You & I end up in a police car together . Using only four words what would u say to me ? Note : if you comment u must copy and paste this as ur status so i can comment as well . Be a good sport and play along . 4 words are harder than u think (:
