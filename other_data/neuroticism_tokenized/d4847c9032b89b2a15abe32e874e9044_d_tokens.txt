TNA Fan Interaction was AMAZING on so many levels . No Daff though . Bummer . Blah .. I'm going to focus on the awesome . AJ and < PROPMALE > . < PROPMALE > . Wolfe . < PROPFEMALE > !!! 

Thought I had my voice back but I wake up today and sound like some old woman who smoked for sixty years . 
Discovery Channel talking about a snake . \If the victim can get the anti venom within 30 minutes theres a < PROPMALE > of survival\ " ... holy sh #t balls I am -never- going to Austrailia . " 
I guess I'm not supposed to have my own problems . 
Still unpacking but .. we're here . Internet and cell phone reception is less than stellar but we're here ! 
We just bought 51 comics - 49 of which were wicked cheap ! \ 
Cheap as in price , people . Not in quality . 
No more comics - I've got plenty enough to read - No figs , no video games . Save save save cause comic con is coming to Chicago in a little more than one month ! 
If you have a wonderful man who works hard to\ 
take care of you , would do anything for you , makes you laugh , is your\ 
best friend , who wants to grow old with you , will always pick you up\ 
when you are down , who is your world & someone that you are\ 
thankful for , then post this . I Love You < PROPFIRST > ! 
Just finished watching One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and cried my eyes out . Movies have made me tear up before but I was SOBBING at the end of this one . 
Resident Evil 3D - Afterlife was pretty bad ass . \ 
Trailer for a new SAW movie : also in 3D ... which might be enough to get me into the series again aaand TRON all up in this bitch . Erm I'm a little excited about Tron . 
Well . That hurt ! Pretty sure I broke one of my toes and that the nail is going to fall off another .
