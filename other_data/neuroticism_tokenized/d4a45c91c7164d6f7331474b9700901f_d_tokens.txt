Done with school for today . Pyschology seems like its going to be fun especially since < PROPFEMALE > is in the same class . Seems like I have a good teacher in Spanish and it seems like its going to be wayyyyyy more work than Spanish 2 . \ 
Gotta run some errands before going home .. yay 
So ... running errands was fun ... Waited in line for 20 mins or so to pay for my brother's textbook . When it was our turn to pay , I found out that my bank account was empty ... 
Why make a speech due the second day of class ? -_- 
Today just sucks 
I think I regret taking this Saturday Spanish class ...
