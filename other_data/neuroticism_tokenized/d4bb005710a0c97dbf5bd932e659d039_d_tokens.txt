has been throwing up for 2 days . 

does anybody know how to find groups on here ? 
The freaks come out at night ... the freaks come out ! The freaks come out at night . 
just finished grinding 50 pieces of mirror for < PROPFIRST > . 
already smoked a morning cigar and filled up on french toast , bacon and Green Mountain Roasters coffee . Now I'm going to fold 2 loads of laundry , build my Texas bench , hopefully build my last adirondak chair then wash my super-fly ride when it geets cool 
ended up doing 6 loads of laundry and built my Texas bench . I didn't get around to the adirondak chair or washing my super-fly ride because a dust storm came up out of nowhere and foiled my plans . It's still blowing pretty hard ( <- hahaha ) outside , so 
got my root canal done today . It was a lot better than I thought it was going to be . Now I'm high on vicodin . 
sold my Saab today and bought < PROPFIRST > a brand new 2008 ( 300 < PROPMALE > ) Dodge Nitro . Now I get to drive her Rodeo . That doesn't sound like a good deal does it ? 
Kiss's new album , \Sonic Boom\ " goes on sale at Walmart on Oct 6th ! Can't wait . " 
I hate FARMVILLE ! 
So far , I'm not too impressed with 2011 . 
I just uploaded the old Offutt AFB , 4A0 photos . You've got to check them out . They're hillarious !!! 
is smoking a stogie , drinking coffee and writing a paper for class . 
I'm going to Subway . Does anybody want anything ? I'm getting a meatball sub or something that fat bastards like me can eat and not feel guilty about . 
I don't want to be fat anymore ! 
I'm hoping to get some mouth snuggles tonight . 
is going for a 2-mile run . Word to your mother ! 
is wore out . 2 < PROPMALE > = 20:10 . My new world record ! That's a good start to my 1st Sgt < PROPFEMALE > , baby ! 
is concentrating on push ups and sit ups today . My fat belly is going to be able to stop bullets pretty soon . Or maybe not . 
Now I know why for the past couple of weeks , my right leg is so sore . When I get up from doing my push ups , I rest my right elbow on my right leg and put my weight on it to help me get up . I bet I've been doing that for a long time , probably around the time I had my surgery and didn't even realize it . Good thing I'm not dating a psychology < PROPMALE > or she'd analyze why I do that . 
Apparently I have a big mouth . 
Steve : from urbandictionary.com: A thong that is visable above the trouser line of a girl . A useful word when spotting a thong or pointing one out without the girl knowing 
The < PROPMALE > Pole Shootout is on tonight at 6:00 . Who's watching it ? I'll be at Wingers . 
Homework sucks ! 
Sometimes it's hard being everybody's hero . 
completed my Health Services degree from CCAF . My graduation will be in April sometime . That makes 2 Associates and a BS . Halfway done with my MS ... I hear the ladies beating down my door already ! :) 
Is looking for a 9mm to buy . Anybody have one they want to sell ? 
just ran 1.5 < PROPMALE > in 14:00 flat . Not bad for me . I'm getting so close to reaching my goal . 
just ran 3 < PROPMALE > !!! Took me 33:28 , but I still ran it and ... I could have run more , but < PROPFIRST > was about to send out the search party for me , so I had to call it a night . 
I'm so tired of doing homework ! Taking two classes was not a good idea . I'm taking next sememster off to study for MSgt . 
Is something wrong with the GCU website or is it just me ? I can't log in for longer than like 10 minutes at a time then it takes me an hour to log back in . WTF ??? 
Forget it ! I'm done with GCU for tonight ! I can't even log back in , so I'm not wasting any more of my time with this site ! 
likes the bump-it ! 
is a sweet pimp ! 
hates people who wear pajamas to Wal-Mart , the BX , the commissary , the hospital ... WTF ! Take some pride in yourself and wear clothes . 
is the new MDSS AFSO-21 Rep. I've been waiting for this for a couple of months now . Now I get to start working on some process improvements and earn my Green Belt along the way ! Can't wait ! Thanks Lt Bower and MSgt Hudon !!! 
Things I need for my week-long railroad hike . If you think of something else , feel free to add to the list : 1 ) map 2 ) good hiking boots 3 ) lightweight 1-man tent 4 ) sleeping roll 5 ) backpack 6 ) 9mm 7 ) knife 8 ) first aid < PROPFEMALE > 9 ) MRE - the yummy ones 10 ) canteen 11 ) extra clothes 12 ) sunscreen 13 ) rain poncho 14 ) boonie hat 
charted out my walk and it's roughly 150 < PROPMALE > . I think I can average 30 mines in a day , so a week will be enough time . 
We've been searching for a Bengal Cat . We were in Boise today and decided to go to the Humane Society and guess what we found ... a 1 year old Bengal Cat . We got her . I just uploaded some pictures of her . 
< PROPFIRST > just gave me a wet-willie and said she wants to kick my ass . I tell her to bring that shit on ! :) 
is down to 186 lbs ! I'm feelin ' the burn . 
I'm so stupid ! I wrote an article for my base paper a couple of months ago and quoted an author I got my inspiration from . That author tried to add me as a friend yesterday . I didn't recognize her name and didn't accept her friend request ! Sometimes I amaze myself , but not in a good way . 
This week is the single-most important week in my USAF career . I test for MSgt on Monday , start AFSO 21 training and finish it up with my annual PT test . God , I hope I do well ! 
Well , I don't think I'll be a MSgt this cycle . PFE was great , but SKT sucked like < PROPFIRST > Tammasimo . 
Completed the first stage of my AFSO 21 training . Now I have to conduct 3 events before I can get my green belt . I already have one in the works . 
I'm going over my first AFSO 21 event . Preparing and getting a team organized . I would like being the Team Lead more than being the Facilitator . SrA Gonzalez is definitely on the team ! She may even be the Team Lead . That would be great experience for an up-and-coming SSgt . 
So ... I'm completly adicted to Smoothie Moves ! I got 153 coins at level 10 . 
Days off are nice , but they're so damn boring . If I had something to do , that would be a different story , but just sitting at home getting fat sucks ! Now I wasted an entire day out of my life that I'll never get back and I have nothing to show for it . 
OMG , only 7 minutes went by since my last post . Maybe I'll just see what my friends are up to . How come when I was younger , I could spend all day on the internet just looking up stupid stuff ? 
Panties on the ground , panties on the ground . Looking pretty good with your panties on the ground . :~) 
So , I got my BOP to Robins yesterday ! YES !!! I hate this place so much ! I'm so glad to be leaving . My report date is 30 Sep . I have three AFSO21 events to do and a clean up of the outpatient records section to do before my job is complete . I start Saturday morning , bright and early . 
Changed my profile picture this evening . This is one of the best books I've ever read and one of the few I've ever saved . I'm a romantic at heart and this is a true romantic story . Amor and Psyche . I'm sure Joy Beard will agree . 
Jumping rope is a good workout . It definitely got my heart pumping . 
is so tired of doing homework ! I so want to stop taking classes . Luckily I'll have about 2 months off while I move to < PROPFEMALE > , then 4 more classes . 
is so tired ... I think I'm going to get put on quarters . 
hates 4-day weekends . I'm SOoooo bored ! 
God , I need to make an appointment to get my eyes checked . 
I just did something to my back while < PROPFIRST > was throwing up . I must've pulled it the wrong way while jumping to help him . Gawd , that freakin ' hurts ! This getting old shit is for the birds . 
Doing homework . I've got one more week then I'm done for the next 6 months . 
Finished my 1st AFSO 21 event ! I had the best time and think I learned more in those three days than I have in the four years since I was an MTL ! I can't wait to facilitate my 2nd event next month . 
I'm going to sit in the sauna for 20 minutes at 1700 today . Anybody want to come with me ? Males , females , anybody ? 
I like to read dirty harlequin books and drink appletinis . I think I was supposed to be born a woman . 
Just ran 1.5 < PROPMALE > to work , worked on my EPR , then ran 1.5 < PROPMALE > back home . Time for a shower ! 
has a new boyfriend 
Got both cars washed , waxed the Mustang and am leaving with < PROPFIRST > for Shuck's Auto Parts to get < PROPFIRST > two license plate covers while she naps . Word to yur mother ! 
is busy downloading some Ace Frehley music for the listening pleasure of the broads I work with . 
needs a new look . Does anybody have any suggestions ? 
got the Nitro washed . I'm now eating a bowl of chicken noodle soup , washing it down with a bottle of ice water and am about to wash the Mustang . I also got all the dished done as well as all the laundry . It's been a productive day for yours truly . 
I'm not just fly , I'm SUPER FLY ! 
... continuing with my diet and exercise regime . Not fun , but I'm seeing results a lot more quickly than I expected . I'm starting to look like a fool with my pants on the ground ( because they're too big for me now ) . 
just bought some good running shoes from a real running store in Meridian . They video taped me running , then showed me the problem areas . I can't wait to try them out tonight !!! 
just finished a run around the block in my new shoes . Not bad , if I do say so myself . I can feel my shins aching a tad-bit , so I better lay off for a day or so . 
is busy downloading Metallica , Haggar and < PROPFIRST > Halen for the long drive to < PROPFEMALE > . 
Just spent the past 4 hours sorting all my CDs . Ended up getting rid of 241 that I don't listen to anymore . Will probably take them to Boise to hock at the used CD store . Even if I get $1 a piece for them , that's two new tires for my baby ! 
Has been spending the past 2 hours uploading music to my MP3 player ... with the assistance of my lovely wife . 
I'm missing a Foo Fighters CD . What a lousy day this is turning out to be ... 
Phew !!! Found it ! 
Saturday , 21 August , Ace Frehley and < PROPFIRST > Gibbons are going to make their debut appearance at the Wal-Mart in Mountain Home ! Ladies , get your cameras ready !!! 
I'm thinking of selling my body to some homeless bums for spending money . 
Two more days of work until I move to < PROPFEMALE > . 
But first ... the dreaded PT test . 
About to go the Summer Bash and then to the flea market with the fam and my folks then to Target to get < PROPFIRST > a new Webkinz . It should be a good day . 
Living in a one-room hotel is such a thrill . I don't know why more people don't do it . 
I can't believe I paid somebody to do this to me . I am sooooo tired and sore and I have to do it again in two days !!!!! 
is watching The Karate Kid and trying to choke down 152 ounces of water in one day ... all while nurse my poor muscles . :) 
Bored out of my freakin ' mind . I used to be able to spend all day searching the most obscure topics , now Ican't find anything interesting to do online . 
Did facebook change the way I search for people ? There's no icon any more that lets me type somebody's name in !!!!! I hate Facebook sometimes !!! 
I thought I had good posture . I recently learned that I don't . 
This is for < PROPFEMALE > ! If you have a wonderful man , who helps balance your whole world ... who isn't perfect but is perfect for you ... who works hard and would do \ 
anything for you and your family ... that makes you laugh ... who is your \ 
best friend ... who you want to grow old with ... and who you are thankful \ 
... for every day ! Then post this on your status ...? 
Watching < PROPMALE > , Texas Ranger and reading the 4A0 CFETP . That's what I call a good day . 
Come on people now , smile on your brother . Everybody get together , try to love one another right now . 
Damn it ! < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > was just wrecked with 9 laps to go . That's a freakin ' bummer ! 
I miss my cats ! 
Talking to my best Turkish buddies , Tunder and Figen 
7 laps to go and there's a wreck between < PROPFIRST > Ragan and < PROPMALE > Busch . < PROPMALE > almost got caught up in it . It'll be a green , white , checkers finish ! Let's go racin'!!! 
< PROPMALE>'s in the lead with 3 to go . Still under caution . 
Gordon'd up from 24th to 17th . 
5 wide !!! 
< PROPMALE > won !!! < PROPMALE > came in 9th . Not a bad finish . At least < PROPMALE > didn't win . < PROPMALE>'s still the points leader , though . We have to rally behind somebody ... anybody to beat < PROPMALE > . 
Going to wax my car . I'll be thinking about < PROPFIRST > Capitano . 
Watching Ironman II and nursing a headache . I didn't even get to wax my car ; I just got to clean the inside because my head hurt too bad . 
So , I'm trying to think of a movie from the 80's ( I think ) . It's about a dude who has a pair of glasses or things he has that when he wears them , something tracks where his eyes look . Something like that . I saw it as a kid and that's about all I remeber . Except a fight scene at the end where somebody is fighting with him in a room and he has his glasses on ... 
They call me Dr. Love . They really do . Only the ladies ; though , not the dudes . The dudes don't call me that . 
I should call The Goldwater Law Firm because I have one of the symptoms of Lergen ... jerking arm . I've never taken Legren though . Do you think I have much of a case ? 
Is busy screening Customer Service DVDs for my next mentor briefing . I'm going to have my element watch one of them , then have a group discussion so we can improve our internal and external customer service . During out last mentor briefing , we went over weaknesses and two of the Airmen identified customer service as their weakness . I'm actually iterested in this . 
So , I got my entire element released for 2 hours on Thursday to watch the dignified transfer of a fallen < PROPFEMALE > killed on 6 Oct . I'm sure this will be a moving event for everybody . 
Rumor spreadin ' a-round ... in that Texas town\ 
' Bout that shack outside La Grange\ 
And you know what I'm talkin ' about\ 
Just let me know ... if you wanna go\ 
To that home out on the range\ 
They gotta lotta nice girls , ah 
I love African Child ! 
got a bug bite on my leg , now it's black and blue . Weird !!! 
Amaretto and Pepsi ; may be a girl's drink but it's yummy to my fat tummy . 
Settling in to watch < PROPFIRST>'s Day . Sure hope theres a little nudity in it . 
I bought a NordicTrack ball today and two 10 lb weights ... that sounds like a wimpy workout , but it's not . I'm sweating like a whore in chuch . 
< PROPMALE > is in 2nd at lap 99 of 334 . 
< PROPFIRST > Ragan is my #2 guy from now on ; currently in 15th . He's from this area and just bought a Ford dealership in < PROPFIRST > , GA . 
< PROPFIRST > just took the points lead back ! Go < PROPFIRST > !!! 
Kahne just wrecked . damn . 
Poor Hornish . I like him ; hope he does well . He's an Ohio boy . I bet you like him huh < PROPFIRST > ? 
There's a new < PROPMALE > ( The Rock ) < PROPMALE > movie ... \Faster\ " . Can't wait to check it out . " 
< PROPMALE > came out of the pits first , but 18 people didn't pit . That Fucking < PROPMALE > Letart and his dumb advice does this shit all the time . That fuck stick ! 
I guess 8 cars didn't pit , so maybe < PROPMALE > has a < PROPMALE > to pass those fools . < PROPMALE > is one of them . What a douche ! 
DAMN IT ! < PROPMALE > lost power and went a lap down . TYPICAL 
What's the point anymore ? Maybe Ragan will be my #1 guy from now on ... until < PROPFIRST > Everhham comes back anyway . 
Talladega this weekend , baby !!! Best race of the YEAR !!!!! 
Everybody welcome me to the 21st century . I finally got a 4G phone and learmed how to go to FB on it 
Dear Mr. President , I hear you would like to freeze pay rates for soldiers starting next year . Would you also consider cutting your own pay to save much more money for our country ? While you're at it , lets cut down congressman's pay too . If the people who risk their lives dont get an increase in pay , why would we continue raising pay for those who take no risks and reap the benefits ?! Keep it going if you agree 
Enjoying the warm weather in < PROPFEMALE > ! 
It was a cold day in < PROPFEMALE > today . 
That < PROPMALE > Wolf is a freakin ' genious ! 
Great ! It's freaking snowing . 
Our trip back from North Carlonia to < PROPFEMALE > calls for 100% < PROPMALE > of snow ! Karma .. I hate you ! 
Constipated people don't give a crap . 
Just finished my 1st spin class , now I'm addicted ! Thanks < PROPFEMALE > Moore for guilt tripping me into going ! 
Now , my name is MCA . I've got a license to kill . I think you know what time it is . It's time to get ill . 
Copy this and paste it in your status if you know someone , or have heard of someone who knows someone . If you don't know anyone , or even if you've heard of someone who doesn't know anyone , then do still copy this . It's important to spread the message . Oh and the hearts ? ? ? ... for crap's sake don't forget the hearts ! ? ? ? 
Busy downloading some country classics for my upcoming deployment . I need some good classics to keep me company . < PROPMALE > T . Hall , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > Gosdin , < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > , HW Jr. , < PROPFIRST > Jones , < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > ... brings back some good memories of when I was a youngen ( as < PROPFIRST > would say ) . 
It was so nice out today . I PTed on the outdoor track . I Love < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Just did 5 sets of situps . 30 , 25 , 23 , 30 & 30 . Ready for bed now . 
Working on deck designs is so much fun ! I could do this all day . The electrician came out today to wire < PROPFIRST>'s fort for lights and an electrical outlet . He's coming back tomorrow to < PROPFEMALE > two outdoor lights next to the back door . What kind of a house doesn't come with back porch lights ? It'll look good just in time for summer though ! Then I'm off to Afghanistan , but will enjoy it when I get back . 
Bye bye #66 ! 
Mustache March , here I come ! 
Just ran a 5K and feel great . First 5K ever . Thanks < PROPFEMALE > ! 
This profile picture was taken awhile ago . 
< PROPMALE > into the wall ... hard . Damn it . 
Thanks to everybody for the birthday wishes ! Now I'm only one year away from 40 . Geez ! I don't feel old , but I bet I look it . I remember when my dad turned 40 . I can't be that close yet . 
So ... in order to help me pass this new USAF PT test on 28 Mar , I've had to resort to Nutrisystem . I've lost 7 pounds in 8 days . I need to lose a couple of inches off my waste and i'll be good ... I think . 
Duh ! Winning . 
< PROPFIRST > had a GYN appt with her new doc today ... Col Lingus . 
Bored out of my freakin ' mind ! 
< PROPFIRST > has a new job . On Saturday while < PROPFIRST > and I are out shooting AR15s , she's going to be on Live Nation buying the best < PROPFIRST > Buffett tickets we can afford . He's coming to Atlanta on 24 May ... right before I deploy , so perfect timing . < PROPFIRST > Buffett tailgating , here we come ! 
< PROPFIRST > Buffett ... you old Parrot Head , here we come !!! I just bought 4 tickets to see you in Atlanta on 24 May . I think I'll take < PROPFIRST > , my new old friend < PROPFIRST > and his wife < PROPFEMALE > . Word ? Word ! 
Time to break out all the old < PROPFIRST > Buffett CDs , blow off the dust and crank that stuff up . Ha ! There was never any dust on my < PROPFIRST > Buffett CDs . I was just kidding . 
My 4th 5K done . My right < PROPFEMALE > is hurting again but Ill survive . 
Who drinks apple pie ? Oh , I do . Cant wait to get my buzz on . 
So , 2 years ago I made a goal of achieving a weight of 175 pounds and a 36\ waist . Today I weighed in at 175 pounds with a 36\ " waist . " 
My new goal is 170 pounds , 35\ waist and an 85% on my PT test before I deploy in June . Next I want to score a 90% on my PT test while I'm deployed . " 
And all that wouldnt be possible without my supportive wife's encouragement . Plus it helps that shes lost 23 pounds and is attracting all the buff dudes . 
Just took the PFE portion of my WAPS test . EASY PEASY JAPANESEY ! Now for the SKT portion . 
About to run another 5K . Im gung ho about them until I hear the alarm go off . Now Im here and ready to go . Another hour to go though . My next goal is a 10K . 
I'm the proud owner of a new Glock 17 9mm . My first gun ! You should see me shine when I hold it in my hands . I tuck it into it's case at night and sing it lullabys until it falls asleep
