dwelling in the over-stimulating world of groton country life ! 

work work work ... YAY this is why I want to sing ! Working on auditions . 
< PROPMALE > , as in god 
rediscovering the joys of < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > ! 
cramming for an audition ! Nothing like < PROPFEMALE > Burana to make you feel like you're back in undergrad during jury week . Who would've guessed high Ds are what get your goose cooked ! Wish me luck ! :-) 
well ... we'll get to see how the cramming worked ... carmina audition is tonight at 630 !! thanks for the support ... keep those happy thoughts and well wishes going till about 7pm tonight !! 
alright ... well ... the audition is done .. thanks for the support everyone !! Now comes the fun part ... waiting ! : - / 
thinks argyle socks = happy < PROPMALE > ! 
feels like this describes his personality today : I'm just a little black raincloud hovering under a < PROPFEMALE > tree ... I'm just a little black raincloud pay no attention to little me ... everyone knows that a raincloud never eats < PROPFEMALE > , no , not a nip ... I'm just floating around over the ground wondering where I will drip ... 
so ... finished grandpa and grandma's grandchildren quilt this weekend . It's super cute , if I do say so myself . And we finished 36 of the 42 heart cakes ... I can still smell the frosting . I'm glad V day only comes once a year ... 
corrected by the powers that be ( grandma ) we made 46 cakes ... at $6 a piece . 
is content ... new cologne and argyle socks ... happy quotient is high ... enough to battle work ? I think so . 
wonders why it takes management hearing a sarcastic , off-handed comment dripping with disdain to inquire about his happiness and value at the company he works at ... 
thanks God for optimism ! No < PROPFEMALE > solo . Not yet anyway ... syracuse symphony is doing it next season though ... maybe I'll catch an audition for it .
