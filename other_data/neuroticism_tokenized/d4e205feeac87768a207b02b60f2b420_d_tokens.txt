Little darling , it's been a long cold lonely winter \ 
Little darling , it feels like years since it's been here \ 
Here comes the sun , here comes the sun \ 
and I say it's all right - the beatles 
I will run the streets and hostile lands\ 
I will touch the rain with all I have\ 
I will breathe the air , just scream it loud\ 
My feet will never touch the ground\ 
Because the days they feel like ancient clocks\ 
Like when kids grow up and learn to walk\ 
Because your life is full of pure desire\ 
A place so gloriously wired\ 
- Heaven by : Angels and airwave 
spending the night at brennons , babysitting in the moring . hopefully my ipod will be born again !

As I stare through these tears , I see your \ 
lips start to turn . This world is so un-perfect , this love is so \ 
un-worth it . When you're here I don't need all the things I had ,... Once\ 
before I was someone but that's not who I am . - Bro < PROPFEMALE > is here ; \ 
Attack Attack 
We're going down , down in an earlier round \ 
And Sugar , we're going down swinging \

A loaded god complex , cock it and pull it 
peterpan complex cause i just wont grow up ;P 
Meet me on Thames Street\ 
I'll take you out , though I'm hardly worth your time\ 
In the cold you look so fierce but I'm warm enough\ 
Because the tension's like a fire\ 
We'll hit\ 
South Broadway in a matter of minutes\ 
And like a bad movie , I'll drop a line\ 
Fall in the grave I've been digging myself , \ 
But there's room for two\ 
Six feet under the stars 
and so hopefully my training will begin :p 
ya i actually started training today ! PROBLEY running with brennon 2night , for now im cleaning and swimming 
And all the roads we have to walk along are winding \ 
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding \ 
There are many things that I would \ 
Like to say to you \ 
I don't know how 
I'mma do the things That I wanna do\ 
I ain't got a thingTo prove to you\ 
I'll eat my < PROPFEMALE > With the pork and beans\ 
Excuse my manners If I make a scene\ 
I ain't gonna wear The clothes that you like\ 
I'm fine and dandy With the me inside\ 
One look in the mirror And I'm tickled pink\ 
I don't give a hoot About what you think 
its almost funny , sometimes i wonder ... if she even knows whats she is doing and what it does to me :/ 
Mom and dad they quite don't understand it , \ 
all the kids they laugh as if they planned it\ 
Why do girls wanna pierce their nose , \ 
and walk around in torn pantyhose , oh yeah\ 
\ 
I like the ones who say they listen to the punk rock\ 
I like the kids who fight against how they were brought up\ 
They hate the trends and think it's fucked to care , \ 
it's cool when they piss people off with what they wear , oh yeah 
Does anyone know what time soccer tryouts are 2marrow ? 
Josie\ 
You're my source of most frustraion\ 
Forget when I don't meet expectations\ 
Everything you wished came true\ 
In the end we all blamed you\ 
Even though , as they all know\ 
You weren't the only one ( two three four .. ) 
I'm sick of always hearing\ 
All the sad songs on the radio\ 
All day it is there to remind an over sensitive guy\ 
That he's lost and alone , yeah 
i literarily just like all of < PROPFIRST > Sliger ' s photos and a buch of his comments ..... will this get me into the #1 spot of , \who the hell is stalking me now ? \ " mabey ... but it'll deff piss him off " 
i could travel the world for years and still not understand it all 
I'm trying to forget that\ 
I'm addicted to you\ 
But I want it and I need it\ 
Now it's over\ 
Can't forget what you said\ 
And I never wanna do this again\ 
Heartbreaker\ 
Heartbreaker 
Tell me what's wrong with society\ 
When everywhere I look I see\ 
Young girls dying to be on TV\ 
They wont stop ' til they've reached their dreams\ 
Diet pills , surgery\ 
Photoshop pictures in magazines\ 
Telling them how they should be\ 
It doesn't make sense to me\ 
Is everybody going crazy ? \ 
Is anybody gonna save me ? \ 
Can anybody tell me what's goin on ? \ 
Tell me what's going on\ 
If you open ur eyes\ 
u'll see that something is wrong 
Cuz we lost it all \ 
Nothing lasts forever \ 
I’m sorry \ 
I can’t be Perfect \ 
Now it’s just too late \ 
And we can’t go back \ 
I can’t be Perfect 
ya its been a simple plan kind of day :P 
Get the fuck up she said\ 
your life is meaningless\ 
it's going nowhere , you're going nowhere\ 
you're just a fuck up she said , I'll live alone instead\ 
she said you don't care , I know I don't care\ 
I'll never ask permission from you , \ 
fuck off I'm not listening to you\ 
I'm not coming home , I'm never going to come back home

In the saddest state it's ever been . \ 
This is no place to try and live my life . 
Let's take some time to talk this over \ 
You're out of line and rarely sober \ 
We can't depend on your excuses \ 
Cause in the end it's fucking useless \ 
You can only < PROPFEMALE > on me for so long \ 
Bring your ship about to watch a friend drown \ 
Stood over the ledge \ 
Begged you to come down \ 
You can only < PROPFEMALE > on me for so long 
The angry boy , a bit too insane\ 
Icing over a secret pain\ 
You know you don't belong\ 
You're the first to fight\ 
You're way too loud\ 
You're the flash of light on a burial shroud\ 
I know something's wrong 
Actions have reactions , don't be quick to judge You may not know the hardships people don't speak of It's best to step back , and observe with couth For we all must meet our moment of truth - Gang < PROPFEMALE >

These children learn from cigarette burns , fast cars , fast women , and cheap drinks , \ 
It feels right , \ 
All these asphyxiated , self-medicated ; take the white pill , you'll feel alright , 
Part of me , won't agree , \

I cannot sleep I cannot dream tonight\ 
I need somebody and always\ 
This sick strange darkness comes creeping on so haunting everytime\ 
And as I stared I counted the webs from all the spiders\ 
catching things and eating their insides\ 
Like indecision to call you\ 
And hear your voice of treason\ 
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight\ 
stop this pain tonight 
Buy hope , hope that it lasts , \ 
give in , forget the past\ 
Be strong when things fall apart , \ 
honest this breaks my heart
