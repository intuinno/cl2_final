I believe in Jesus Christ . One facebooker has challenged all believers to put this on their wall .

\For every beauty there is an eye somewhere to see it . For every truth there is an ear somewhere to hear it . For every love there is a heart somewhere to receive it \"" 
love is accepting , not expecting . 
don't try so hard , the best things come when you least expect them to . 
let go of what is gone and hold on to what you have . 
in all your remembering , remember that you have choices . 
you think you look strong because you can hold on , but strength lies in letting go . 
Though many people will go in and out of your heart only one will want to stay there . If you bulid a heart full of holes , think how much easier it is to < PROPFEMALE > on . 
\the power of imagination makes us infinite . \""

Change your facebook profile picture to a cartoon from your childhood and invite your friends to do the same . Until Monday ( Dec . 6 ) there should be no human faces on facebook , but an invasion of memories . This is for violence against children . just in case you were wondering why peoples pics are cartoons (: 
\WARNING ! The group asking everyone to change their profile picture to their favorite cartoon is actually a group of pedophiles . They're doing it because kids will accept their friend request if they see a cartoon . It has nothing to do with supporting child violence . Its on tonight's news . Pass this onto everyone who has a cartoon profile picture ! \""

Greatest man in history named Jesus . Had no servants , yet they called Him Master . Had no degree , yet they called Him Teacher . Had no medicines , yet they called Him Healer .
