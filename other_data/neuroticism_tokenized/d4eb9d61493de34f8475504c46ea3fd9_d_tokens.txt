doesn't even want to think about how much money this thesis is going to cost in lattes , tea , and coffee . 
structured my entire day around being home in time to watch glee . 
so apparently you can win a nobel peace prize just by talking about peace ... who knew ? 
loves the amount of work saved by reading a well-highlighted used book . 
wasted my whole afternoon watching a piece of mylar float over the middle of nowhere while a little kid hid in a cardboard box in his attic . good use of time . 
why is it that when you get sick in college it takes a ridiculously long time to get over it ? 
typed out 60+ pages of thesis notes/outline in a ( rare ) weekend of productivity

why is christmas the only holiday that can have a message ? 
really wants to get a < PROPFEMALE > next year . there's something missing in any house ( or apartment ) that doesn't have pets :(

why doesn't obama ever look straight ahead ? 
no other president before obama has EVER inherited difficulties from the previous administration . 
somehow google can search through the text of practically every book in existence and old newspapers from 50 years ago . ? google ! 
stepped barefoot on my straightener on full heat . good way to start the day . 
productivity feels good 
the grammys are like a giant showcase of just how bad music has gotten . what happened to real musicians ? 
the only good thing about february is that it's short . 
NO MORE SNOW .

enjoyed receiving my \Your Invited\ " email from the academic council . Ironic much ? " 
just tryin to get to somewhere , just end up gettin by 
spring break in one week . graduation in less than 3 months . omg ! 
love that feeling when you find a song that feels like it was written for you 
finding it sort of insulting that getting sick is a much better way of losing weight than going to the gym every day . 
unashamed to be spending spring break in ohio . 24 hours ! 
spring break couldnt have come at a better time ... one long-as-hell amtrak ride until home ! 
getting up at 4:30 am tomorrow to drive to < PROPMALE > for a probably half hour < PROPMALE > interview ... tired in advance . 
\we have to pass the < PROPMALE > so that you can find out what is in it \"- < PROPFEMALE > pelosi "

apparently too many teenyboppers voting on american idol 
2 am train back to georgetown . getting ready to face more work than i know what to do with . 
not a < PROPMALE > student anymore , but i'm even i'm starting to feel a little sad at all the bad news coming out of ithaca . 
now is not a good time to get hooked on project runway reruns ... 
has a move-in date for my new apartment and is one step closer to a great internship ... things are getting really real ! 
missing winter already 
sitting here listening to a lecture about why it's important to staple your papers . should've slept in . 
there's no stress chipotle can't fix 
people who can't sing shouldn't post covers on youtube . 
library outlet apparently broke all my chargers . maybe a sign that i shouldn't be doing work over break ? 
frantically writing my thesis like my life depends on it ... or at least like my graduation depends on it . 
lease signed , internship secured ! 
glee ! 
thesis advisor is happy with thesis ... this is encouraging . 
burnout . 
about to cross into triple digits of pages ... 
if it looks like a duck , walks like a duck , and talks like a duck .... 
i don't want to be up this late on a saturday night unless i'm drunk . and i'm not . 
thanks pepco . great way to start the week . 
is it too late to drop out ?

burnout burnout burnout burnout burnout 
somehow managed to end up with almost 10 hrs of class today , which i'll be attempting on half that amount of sleep . 
thesis is so big word is freezing up on me . c'mon word ... we only need to make it to may 10 . 
if you want to get shitfaced at 6 pm , that's cool , but stop screaming and begging for attention . no one cares . 
1 more day of college classes 
running out of fun tv shows to study to ... suggestions ? 
and just like that ... done with college classes forever . weird ! 
wish i could figure out a way to do finals without stress eating ...

playing with the idea of signing up for guitar lessons ...

and the world spins madly on 
can't remember the last time i was this sore ... <3 the rpac 
fall class schedule is up .... law school in less than a month .... 
thanks OSU parking for not giving me a much deserved parking ticket :) 
we have actual law school homework already ??? noooooo :( 
ugh why is life so expensive ... i give up . 
new season of project runway ! 
having separation anxiety about leaving the < PROPFEMALE > with a babysitter for the week :( 
bachelorette finale ! 
heading back to < PROPMALE > in the morning :) 
happy to be back with my < PROPFEMALE > in my cozy little apartment 
t-1 week until law school . 
rammed my foot into a wall and ended up with a painful , bleeding wound on the bottom of my foot . maybe god's way of telling i should stay in and do my homework . i think i'll go to the gym instead . 
decided to do law reading with an already pounding headache . bad call . 
given my luck with computers , buying a new computer on friday the 13th might not have been the greatest idea . 
can it be winter already ? 
last day of summer/freedom 
law school in the morning ... 
my apartment building is holding a contest for residents to identify the nighttime skinny dippers . i will not be participating . 
long day of reading , class starts tomorrow . goodbye life :( 
officially a 1L in the morning . 
law homework while watching keeping up with the kardashians . it's all about balance . 
clearly i'm going to have to reintroduce caffeine into my life . 
would love clarification on why we're reading 20 pages of pure philosophy for crim law . 
is such a lightweight . i need to fix that . 
is beat . 
gave in to the color-coded highlighting system . 
sleeping for the rest of my life .... or until 5:30 am :( 
\ .... life\ " - < PROPFEMALE > Bi " 
this many years later , i'm still the kid who needs the janitor to unjam my locker . 
glad that being the DD kept me away from the 2 dollar margaritas . 
one of those days where you just give up and figure it out tomorrow . 
skin is breaking out and voice is cracking like a thirteen year-old boy . cute . 
will never understand how professors can look at a room full of dying people and continue to keep talking . 
Join the mosh ! Vote for < PROPFIRST > Snowden for 1L SBA rep on Friday ! 
one of those days . going on a much-needed gym trip . 
vote for < PROPFEMALE > Bi , < PROPFIRST > Snowden , and Saar Mahna for 1L SBA reps this Friday ! 
let's roll and go bucks ! 
still laughing at < PROPFIRST > swift's kanye west revenge song . 
having a big clusterfuck of a monday morning . 
you know you've made a good life decision when you suddenly feel pumped up about life . 
day 1 of taking charge of my life . 
tired of facebook showing me random faces and asking me to tag them . no facebook , i don't know every single person my friends were ever in a picture with . 
looks like someone hacked into my gmail and sent out spam .... sorry if you got something weird from me :( 
ironic that this is my most productive friday night thus far .... 
never imagined i'd be working on my senior thesis right now ... funny how things change ! 
reading while drinking wine and juice boxes . livin the life . 
hoping tomorrow is a much better day . 
officially enrolled in a grad history course to prove myself worthy . here we gooo .... 
last-minute GRE studying

paper all night . GRE take two tomorrow . 
GRE success/ done with standardized testing forever ( for real this time ) . 
best google homepage ever . make sure to click on it . 
made the mistake of taking my school books to the cosmetology school salon . apparently the hairdressers were not impressed with my reading selection . 
figured out to reattach my car mirror ... crisis averted . 
of course my computer would die now that i actually need it . obviously . 
leave it to < PROPFIRST > moore to insult the chilean miners for his own political agenda . what a scum . 
thanks for ruining my plans to study in the library , obama . 
thank god for caffeine 
working on what i hope will be the last admssions essay i ever write . 
love it when i break my < PROPMALE > and they replace the top case .... it's like getting a brand new computer :) 
nothing more emotionally draining than wanting something that's out of your hands . 
who needs sleep anyway ? 
not excited for the cyclone that's coming to < PROPMALE > this afternoon . 
trying to write a scholarly-sounding paper while eating sour gummy worms 
ahhhh why do grad school apps have to be such a clerical nightmare ??? 
spending halloween night with my black cat in apartment # 13 :) 
looks like i'm getting my PhD at tOSU ! 
having yet another temper tantrum at microsoft word . 
nothing better than finishing a rough day with a full night of paper writing ..... 
thank you veterans 
watching the cat sleep while i write this paper makes me realize who's actually got it figured out . 
wanted to post a complainy status . then i remembered i don't have a contracts exam on monday . 
how am i supposed to pay attention to my cold war propaganda book when the girl next to me is on a college interview describing the story shes writing about vampires hiding in hospitals ? 
really really hoping my BSing abilities serve me well tomorrow ... 
officially survived the hardest class ive ever taken and feel strangely ready for more ..... after break :) 
wish i could just rip my sinuses out of my face !! 
why is it that every time i find someone's ID and/or credit card and contact them about it , they expect ME to go out of my way to give it back to them .... 
did i really just see a commercial for the BK whopper for breakfast ? 
having no work always sounds like a great idea until it happens . 
today i officially sign the papers that make me a university employee ( read : slave ) . 
anyone have any ideas for making a bum knee stop hurting ? 
apparently my short time off from academia has turned me into a wannabe interior decorator . 
tired of trying to read news online . finally breaking down and ordering a print newspaper like a crusty old man . 
one of those mornings where it would feel so great to punch someone in the face . volunteers ? 
going out to buy myself a christmas present . christmas isn't all about buying for other people :) 
is going to take all the energy i spend worrying about pointless things and wasting time online into becoming decent at guitar . new years resolution . 
who ever decided the song \i saw mommy kissing < PROPFEMALE > claus\ " was a good idea ... " 
hates those moments when i realize that male chauvinism is , in fact , not dead . 
cruising through < PROPMALE > tonight rocking out to the radio made me realize that i live in a great city and life is fabulous . i should complain less . 
buying a guitar was a great life decision . 
after mincing one clove of garlic , i smell like an entire < PROPFEMALE > garden restaurant . this is why i don't cook . 
in the market for a new , non-mac ( macs are too expensive ) laptop . suggestions from anyone who actually likes their laptop ? 
not ungrateful for the awesome things that happened in 2010 , but very ready for 2011 and a fresh start . 
guitar is the best de-stressing activity i've ever found . highly recommend . 
computers hate me , and yes , it IS personal . 
nothing like a < PROPFEMALE > walking around on the desk to make a crappy assignment tolerable . 
turns out that finding a 20 on the ground is a great way to start the day . 
tonight i saw a man eating a pint of ice cream all by himself in his car . it's good to know men also eat their feelings . 
today -- for the first time -- i'm just going to write a paper without stressing over every word and worrying about what the prof will think . just going to get my 5-7 pages , and then chill out . 
apparently the guy next door is having a hissy fit and throwing shit at my wall .... awesome . 
writing a paper and feeling vaguely sick to my stomach . not my night . 
turning into the grouchy bitch telling people to shut up in the library . i guess i really am in grad school . 
geez , don't look so excited boehner . 
there must be something addictive in bubble tea . 
experiencing a rare day of productivity 
after months of dealing with the giant blackhole of OSU bureaucracy , it feels pretty awesome to get an official acceptance letter :) 
nothing better than an early morning gym trip 
second time in one night that i've had to disconnect the smoke detector because of a cooking error . i give up ! 
the kid sitting next to me in the library just pulled out a bag of almonds . it's official : there's no end to how obnoxious people can be . 
there's something kind of refreshing about realizing you're a complete moron , accepting it , and moving on with the day . 
here's where i try to do work on very little sleep with the prospect of even less sleep tonight ... 
you get right down to the bottom of the barrel . and you float back on top . 
\One of the symptoms of an approaching nervous breakdown is the belief that one's work is terribly important . \"" 
the best part of writing to sell yourself is when you actually start believing it . 
where is the sun and why can't we have any of it ? 
compare , where you are to where you want to be , and you'll get nowhere . 
okay , who agrees that glee has gone completely off the deep end ? 
procrastination isnt just for undergrads ..... 
i'm starting to see the wisdom in having two screens for taking notes on internet stuff . adding this to my growing to-do list of life improvements 
not sure if it's appropriate to be writing about world war I with a sparkly pink pen ... 
oh hey daylight savings time , nbd , i didn't need that extra hour or anything . 
celebrating pi day by reveling in the fact that i'll never need to study math ever again . happy pi day everyone ! 
isn't going to have the same hair color by the end of today :) 
is sorta kinda blonde ! 
always upsetting to see a beautiful fur coat on some ugly human . 
made it to 7.5 < PROPMALE > running on the treadmill . that's a first for me :) 
every so often , it seems appropriate to thank pandora for being awesome . thank you pandora . 
go bucks ! 
over spring break , i suddenly became decent in the kitchen . best use of a break ever ! 
finishing really late applications for summer russian programs and hoping i dont have to spend the summer working at a restaurant . fingers crossed :/ 
officially doing summer russian and getting out of cbus for the summer ! 
debating whether to get my ears pierced . also embarrassed that it would be my first piercing ( does that even qualify ? ) 
reading some good history books and people-watching the neighborhood hipsters . not a bad night . 
drinking espresso and hoping for productivity . 
is getting faster at writing papers . maybe not better , but faster . i'll take it . 
one of those days that just goes from bad to worse . ready for it to be over . 
to end the worst day and week ive had in a long , long time , my cat attacked me and < PROPFIRST > blood for no apparent reason . i can't win . i just want to leave everything here behind and forget this year ever happened . 
the week is a lost cause , but the crisis has been averted . 
worst cold ever . i sound like a chain smoker :( 
i knew < PROPMALE > drivers were bad , but i didnt think they were dumb enough to change lanes into a car directly next to them . ridiculous . 
if anyone has any extra motivation to share , please send some my way . 
who wants to get up super early on friday morning ( like 5 am ) to make fun of the < PROPMALE > wedding with me ? i'm guessing absolutely no one , but it's worth a shot :) 
spent the past 45 mins glaring at a guy at caribou for talking obnoxiously on his cell phone . apparently , however , he misread my sneer and decided it was a good idea to ask for my number after he got off the phone . then he apparently thought it would be good form to protest and argue with me when i politely declined . people are so irritating . 
the more work i get , the more i work out to avoid finishing it all . good or bad thing ? i'm not sure . 
suddenly finding myself really missing DC ... wish i could go back for a weekend ! 
proctoring an undergrad exam . i'm a big kid now . 
why is it that cats always want to sleep on whatever you're reading ?
