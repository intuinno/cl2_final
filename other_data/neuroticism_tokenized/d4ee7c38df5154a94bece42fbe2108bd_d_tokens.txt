So much for getting the day shift off to a good start * sigh * stupid insomnia . 

Saw Tron : Legacy last night , don't know why it got a bad rap that it did I thought it was alright . Although I kept on wanting to shout \IN A CAVE WITH A BOX OF SCRAPS\ " for some reason . " 
Just waiting for the resume company to get my updated resume back to me . It's only been 2 weeks ... 
Got the word today , my last day at work is the 26th . 
Well today was my last day at my job time to find another . 
Ah spring cleaning how fun . 
Grrr stupid reach beta work I paid good money for this thing . 
OK you jokers , here is something for you . I get to \volunteer\ " tomorrow at my wifes work . Making copies how fun . " 
The indyhires job fair was a total waste of time . I could of just stayed home and went to the employers website instead of slogging through the rain . 
Can applying for unemployment benifits be anymore annoying ? 
< PROPFIRST > is here and won't shut up .... no change there . 
< PROPFIRST > left all is quiet again . 
Off to buy a lawn mower and weed wacker today . 
Mowed half the lawn today , I'm really out of shape . 
Bored bored bored . 
Stupid internet is being sloooooooow . 
Doing the laundry . Still need to find a job . 
Geek hell = Having to deal with Windows ME and Clippy for all eternity . 
Watching The Vision of Escaflowne , I haven't seen this in years . 
Off to mow the lawn fun fun . Good thing it's only 90% humidity today . 
Off to see the wizard the wonderful wizard of Id . 
It is way to hot outside . 
Why is a < PROPFEMALE > like a writing desk ? 
Wating for the A/C guy to get here for the estimate on our central air unit . 
Owie my head hurts . 
My internet is so sloooooow . 
Well it looks like I'm going back to school . Today I signed up to get my A+ , Net+ and MCP certifications . 
Off to study for my A+ test . 
My wife is logged onto facebook on the Wii . How lame is that ? She could just ask me for the laptop but she has to go and be all independent and stuff . 
Jet's Pizza is in < PROPFEMALE > now ! And it's coming soon to Greenwood ! 
Waiting for the little bar to make it's way across the screen . Only twenty more minutes to go . 
Dire I like that word , there will be dire repercussions if you don't get this done on time ! Oh and the bar says that there is now twenty-nine minutes remaining . 
Can't sleep , so I'm on FB at 3:30 in the morning ... go me . 
That was different , instead of the normal , homeless looking for work person at the Keystone/86th street corner we have one that has a sign that reads : \Lost job and single looking for work\ " Wha ....? " 
Ok not only was the guy in the stall next to mine while I was going to the bathroom listening to bad R&B on his cell he was also singing along . Really ? Can't you just pee in quiet like everyone else ? 
I've been studying since 2:40 it is now 8pm it's time to blow this Popsicle stand . Although on a good note I retook my Unit 3 exam and did way better this time . Instead of a 60% I got 97% so all that studying paid off . 
Owie my head hurts and I'm at school no relief in sight . 
I passed unit 4 , starting unit 5 next . One more unit until the A+ essentials final exam . 
Beatus homo qui invenit sapientiam 
And I passed unit 5 just one more unit to go till my A+ exam . 
Passed my final exam for A+ . I get to take the big A+ exam on the 1st of September . 
Does anyone in this town know how to drive ? 
Dear Garbageman , I know you probably don't like your job but would it be too hard for you to put the garbage cans back where you found them ? Rather than flinging the can 10 feet one way and the lid 10 feet the other ? Thank you . 
Studying for my Net+ exam .... is really fun . :P 
Waiting is the hardest part . 
I passed the first part of the A+ exam ! 81/100 
Just took a shower I feel refreshed . 
I made the honor roll for the month of August , I'm trying for September as well . 
I wonder when my wife is going to get off her cellphone and join the rest of us . Shes only been on it for about a hour now . 
< PROPFEMALE > and tracert are such fun commands . 
Sator Arepo Tenet Opera Rotas 
Wheeee I feel good ! 
I forgot how annoying FB is without an ad blocker of some sort . * swats at the annoying ads * 
Oi , laptop is in the shop I'm not ignoring you all but it will be a few weeks before we get the laptop back . 
So Best Buy junked our computer no suprise there it was four years old after all . But we got a new computer out of the deal . With 4 gigs of RAM , an AMD Phenom triple-core 2.2 GHz , windows 7 , and a 520 GB harddrive . Which is a lot better than the 800 MHz laptop we used to have . Although Windows 7 is taking a bit to get used to . 
At class for another 20 minutes then off to bowing . Or trying to figure out when we will bowl tonight ... 
Eating cake om nom nom nom . 
Blah blah blah blah blah , listening to a guy drone on and on about network devices is soooo fun . At least its not about binary .... oh wait that is next on the list . 
Up past my bedtime wheeee ! Waiting for < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > to come home . 
Sitting at home on a lazy Sunday afternoon with < PROPFIRST > watching Scrubs which is mildly amusing at times I guess . 
Got a job interview today , and four hours of sleep go me . 
I'm taking part two of the A+ test Friday at 1pm . 
Word of the day :\

Passed my A+ now I'm A+ certified for life ! 
People in this city need to learn how to drive . I don't appreciate being cut off on a exit ramp . 
So < PROPFIRST > \volunteered\ " me at her work again . Wouldn't be too bad except we have to be at the event tomorrow at 5 AM ! Erg ... I'm going to be dead on my feet tomorrow . And I still have to come into school and do two more hours after the event . " 
Dear Semi-truck driver , It's nice that you figured out that you were going to miss your exit . However darting ( and I use that term lightly ) across three lanes of traffic on 465 is not the answer . Just proceed up to the next exit and turn around like a normal sane person would do . Sincerely person who almost collided with a semi truck . 
Dear website developers , almost everyone should have some form of web browser that has tabs . Feel free at anytime to make new windows that tab instead of pop up into a new window it's really annoying . Sincerely person with 10 extra windows open .

The wife is watching Steel Magnolias < PROPFEMALE > Parton looks ..... the same . 
Listening to the muzak in the store and what should come on \Paint it Black\ " er ... wha ? " 
For my Indiana people on my friends list the state police have a new undercover vehicle it's a late model SUV that's gray/brown it color . With huge tires and huge chrome rims . So now that is three undercover vehicles the SUV , the blue Mustang with white racing stripes , and the silver Charger . Just a FYI . 
Butt set .... lol . 
Gobble gobble . 
Nothing like cold turkey , nom nom nom . 
Thought I would put a real picture of me up the wolf thing was getting a bit old . 
I've often wondered if you see a female driving a vehicle with a tramp stamp does she have the same tramp stamp on her back too ? 
So my wife got me Fable 3 during black Friday . My character has a weapon that is a huge axe I'm thinking renaming my dog Astaroth . 
Everything is better with ninjas ! 
It's way too early . 
Is this the \major\ " snowstorm that everyone was talking about a light dusting ? Someone please tell me this wasn't it . " 
Got a interview on Monday with a local tech recruitment firm . Hopefully this interview goes somewhere my last few interviews have not gone anywhere . 
Woot I just got a your awesome but you suck email from a place I had an interview . 
Oh look we have snow , I can still see tops of the grass so it's not the \major\ " snow storm that everyone was afraid of silly Indy people . " 
Passed my Net+ final exam now I just have to set a date for the vendor exam . 
Here is a silly question what is the difference between the 60 dollar per pound Jamaican Blue mountain coffee at the Cheese Shop . And the 30 dollar per pound Jamaican Blue mountain at Fresh Market ? Other than 30 bucks ? It has to be something I don't think they could < PROPFIRST > it up that much higher and still sell it ... unless the people of Fishers are that dumb or desperate . 
Got back a bit ago from my interview , I thought it went well . I'm a lot less nervous now than I was when I first started interviewing . I'll find out early next week if I got the job . 
Went to the dentist today for a consultation about what to do with my teeth . For the first time I had a dentist tell me that they could most likely fix my problems without breaking my jaw . Looks like we finally found an competent dentist . 
On to my new course Installing , configuring and administering windows XP . And the book for the course is a doorstoper coming in well over a thousand pages , and as dry as the sahara desert . 
All setup to take my Net+ vendor exam on the 15th I hope I pass . 
I'm such a geek I use Gmail to spell check posts . 
While playing Fable 3 I didn't really expect to come upon a tavern full of skeletons that were dancing . This is such a strange game from time to time . 
Punching trees . 
Stupid cow get away from my mineshaft .... now I have a cow in my mineshaft ... great . 
I found my first monster spawner I'm so happy . 
And I didn't pass , no biggie just have to get back on the horse and study a bit harder and I'll pass next time . Didn't miss by much I most likely just second guessed myself to much . 
I'm trying not to be bored to tears by local security policy tools lab that I'm doing it's important I know but really boring . However , on the upside I now know how to change a password and unlock someones account if I need to . 
My wife is watching She-Ra on Netflix I wonder if she has regressed to 8 years old or not . 
Great I'd rather her watch She-Ra rather than Precious which has to be the most angsty movie I have ever seen . Oh well . 
I don't know what it is about the holidays that make the normally horrendous drivers in Indy become maniacs but I fear for my safety . A woman in a Camry decided that her < PROPFIRST > wasn't good enough for her and that she would take mine half way through the intersection . I'm just glad there was a turning < PROPFIRST > to dodge into or my car would of had one more dent . 
Well it looks like my interview at < PROPMALE > Staffing was a bust , it's almost 5pm and they haven't called yet to tell me about a interview tomorrow . * sigh * Ah well at least I now have even more interview experience . Come on people it's been almost eight months now haven't I done my penance ? I need a job . 
Nothing like working on my tree farm in Minecraft while listening to the crackle of the < PROPMALE > fire in the background . 
Well it turns out < PROPMALE > Staffing did call they just called the home phone instead of my cell . I got a interview with Telmon ( I think that's right ) on the 11th of January . 
Well this is going to be entertaining , seems we double booked our house this Monday , we have my parents coming over to stay for two days . And < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > coming on their way back to Michigan . Good thing we have two extra bedrooms and a large couch . It's going to be a mite crowded but I'm sure we'll survive . 
At school the day before Christmas < PROPFEMALE > , school is dead , dead , dead . Wheeeeee ! 
< PROPFIRST > Fedell and < PROPFIRST > , are playing Dance Party 2 I'm not nor will I it's to close to DDR . 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas to all who believe in that sort of thing on my friends list if you don't happy yuletide , or winter solstice or whatever . 
Helping my wife win at red mushroom houses on new SMB on the Wii . 
Study , study , study , and study some more . Getting rather peckish though thinking about ditching studying and finding something to nom nom nom on . 
< PROPFIRST > Brown is over chatting about work with my wife . * < PROPFEMALE > sigh * I wish I had a job to chat about . 
School is really busy today people most likely forgot that the school is closed tomorrow and Saturday as well and don't have their 48 hours needed for the month . I don't have that problem I'm sitting on 61.35 hours so far , go me . 
All done with school for this year see you all next year . 
Spent from 8:30 am till 7:00 pm today stuffing envelopes for invites for the Discovery Ball at < PROPFIRST>'s work today fun stuff . 
So Oprah Winfrey now has her own TV network . It's called the Oprah Winfrey Network or OWN . I wonder how long it will take some anonymous hacker to deface the website and make it PWN . 
I really wish I could find a gaming group that wants to play White Wolf's Scion that isn't much to ask is it ? 
So < PROPFIRST > Evans is playing Captain < PROPFEMALE > in the new Captain < PROPFEMALE > movie .... the Human Torch is going to be Captain < PROPFEMALE > . So what happens when the Fantastic 4 meet Captain < PROPFEMALE > ? It's the same universe morons over in < PROPFEMALE > Entertainment land , or is it going to be the Fantastic 3 from now on ?
