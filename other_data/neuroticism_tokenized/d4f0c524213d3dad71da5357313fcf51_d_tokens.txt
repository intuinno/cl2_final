I'm tired ... 

my car was hit in my space between last night and this morning by some white vehicle , had to file hit-n-run report , then get an estamate and drive it around after they took off something that was hitting my tire to make sure it was safe , its just a matter of time and < PROPFEMALE > will get the responsable party , then I'm sueing the bastards and pressing charges .
