I hate when i start zoning out , then I end up staring at someone unintentionally , it really rubs people the wrong way ... free coffee tomarrow ! 
Slithering sea snakes in the high seas slipping inbetween the salty stalagmites 
Forgive me , I have but two faces , one for the world , one for god SAVE ME ! I cannot cry cause the shoulder cries more , I can not die , I a whore for the cold world ! 
When your down and out , when your on the streets my lord , when evening comes , so hard , i will comfort you . I'll take your part when darkness comes and pain is all around , like a bridge over troubled water , i will lay me down ! Solo memorized :) 
When you can't , stand in place , you cant tell whos walking away . ?

\ 
But she laughed and danced through the field of graves\ 
And there I knew it would be alright ? 
Water is clear up close but looks blue from far \ 
away . Scientists are still puzzled by why we cannot see the entire \ 
contents of the ocean just by standing on the beach . 
oh my good golly gosh it is hard to talk to 3 ppl at once even if it is gibberish in 1 conversation 
Who's excited for tomarrow at 9:00 ? 
They will see us waving from such great Heights , ' come down now , ' they'll say But everything looks perfect from far away , ' come down now , ' but we'll stay ...

There's a saltwater film on the jar of your \ 
ashes ; I threw them to the sea , but a gust blew them backwards and \ 
the sting in my eyes that you then inflicted was par for the course just\ 
as when you were living .
