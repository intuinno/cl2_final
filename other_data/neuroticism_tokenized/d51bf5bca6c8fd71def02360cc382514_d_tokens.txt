You got what you want , but it won't get you far Was it what you thought ? You forgot who you are < PROPFIRST > Head Welch - Money lyrics 

Welcome to my world she said , do you feel alive she said It’s all a bad dream , Spinning in your lonely head Welcome to my world she said , Separated world , she stayed separated Down poison , down poison Down poison , down 3 DOORS DOWN \Down Poison \"" 
It feels like everyday stays the same It's dragging me down and I can't pull away So here I go again Chasing you down again Why do I do this ? Three days grace Over and Over 
I believe in you I can show you that I can see right through All your empty lies , I won't stay long In this world so wrong Say goodbye , As we dance with the devil tonight Don't you dare look at him in the eye As we dance with the devil tonight Trembling , crawling across my skin Feeding your cold , dead eyes Stealing the life of mine Breaking Benjamin-Dance with the Devil 
I am losing you again Let me out and let me in ' cause you're not alone here Not at all Let me belong here Break my fall \Break My Fall\ " Breaking < PROPMALE > " 
You can’t quit until you try You can’t live until you die You can’t learn to tell the truth Until you learn to lie You can’t breathe until you choke You gotta laugh when you’re the joke There’s nothing like a funeral to make you feel alive Just open your eyes Just open your eyes And see that life is beautiful . Will you swear on your life , That no one will cry at my funeral ? Sixx : A.M. - Life is Beautiful 
Im growing so distant Nothing makes sense to me anymore Im learning to resist Becoming more than you ever were Cant explain , whats come over me ( come over me ) Cant explain , why its so hard for me , So hard to see your side . Projecting all my anger I cant seem to get this through to you The walls are closing in I dare you to walk in my shoes Hard To See-Five Finger Death Punch 
But you can't judge a book Looking at the cover You can't love someone While messing with another No , you can't win a war Fighting with your brother You wanna have peace Gotta love one another Big guns lighting up the sky Makes me worry Sometimes I wish to run away Sometimes I want to run away BLACK STONE < PROPFEMALE > \Lonely Train\ " LYRICS " 
I'm feeling invincible tonight I'm alive Take a look into my eyes I'm take you for a ride I'm invincible tonight I'm feeling invincible tonight I'm alive Take a look into my eyes I'm take you for a ride I'm invincible tonight I'll break you a hundred different ways And I'll make you remember my face Thought that I would let you leave It's hard to stop what you can't see Adelitas Way — Invincible lyrics 
Now that I've lost you it kills me to say ( Hurts to say ) I've tried to hold on as you've slowly slipped away I'm losing the fight , I've treated you so wrong now let me make it right ( Make it alright ) I'm not insane , I'm not insane ( ha ha ha ha ha ) I'm not insane , I'm not Not insane Almost Easy lyrics Avenge SevenFold 
In a world beyond controlling Are you going to deny the savior In front of your eyes Stare into the night Power beyond containing Are you going to remain a slave for The rest of your life Give into the night Disturbed - The Night Lyrics 
thank you everyone for the birthday wishes 
I got accepted to cloud today ! 
I wither quickly in winter's cold , but < PROPFEMALE > onward like I was told\ 
\ 
And I wait for a sign\ 
Like blood in the tears of all my enemies ( So they will see)\ 
Knowing the pain the way they should\ 
-DEMON < PROPMALE > - Blood In The Tears lyrics 
You were told to to run away\ 
soak the place and light the flame\ 
Pay the price for your betrayal\ 
Your betrayal , Your Betrayal !! \ 
I was told to stay away\ 
Those two words I can’t obey\ 
Pay the price for your betrayal , \ 
Your Betrayal\ 
-Bullet For My ValentineYour Betrayal lyrics 
Left me for dead inside my head\ 
Couldn’t you see that I was still breathing ? \ 
Screaming , I reached for you\ 
I couldn’t get out from under\ 
Where were you ? \ 
I reached for you\ 
The pressure broke me down\

Out From Under lyrics 
So sacrifice yourself , and let me have what's left . \ 
I know that I can find the fire in your eyes . \ 
I'm going all the way , get away , please . \ 
[ Chorus :] \ 
You take the breath right out of me . \ 
You left a hole where my heart should be . \ 
You got to fight just to make it through , \ 
' cause I will be the death of you . \ 
BREAKING BENJAMIN-Breath 
I am with you \ 
I will < PROPFEMALE > you through it all \ 
I won't leave you \ 
I will catch you \ 
When you feel like letting go \ 
' Cause you're not \ 
You're not alone\
