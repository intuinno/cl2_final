\Every man is guilty of all the good he didn't do . \ " ~ Voltaire " 
I love emi and jojo 
First time I have felt this good and this tired in over 5 years :D 
Not understanding the people in this world , wondering if it is better of without me ? 
Just like a crow chasing the butterfly\ 
Dandelions lost in the summer skies\ 
When you and I were getting high as outer space\ 
I never thought you'd slip away\ 
I guess I was just a little too late 
Have you ever felt lost inside so unloved within that you almost die\ 
Have you ever stepped out of the light and realized there's a stranger inside\ 
\ 
Don't push your ignorance on me I'm not unrehearsed to your jealousy\ 
And I know you think I don't see the signs\ 
Well how do you know , do I look blind 
YARRR !!! 
The Irony is i lost my girlfriend and got my bro . 
So take what you want and leave\ 
You'll never get another part of\ 
You're poison on man's lips\ 
Lured in by the curves of your hips\ 
Come here boy , stand by me\ 
Look my way , and have another drink 
Thinking about why someone wants to live or die , Wondering why people try so hard when they don't believe in god , Wondering if there is meaning , Deciding in 8 days . 
Some times I hate being \Psychic\ " makes me mad when I get to a point that I know . " 
Why ? When it comes you wished you had gone ? 
Burning for the end of the start .

Why can't I let fate have it's way with me ? \ 
I would love to but ..... \ 
place all my trust in you\ 
Why can't I ? ' cause ... \ 
It's over , it's over , it's over , it's over again 
Haven't slept in 3 days , Cant get you out of my mind . http://chatter.com/a/fjad2?ref=nf 
I don't regret any days I spent\ 
Nights we shared or letters that I sent 
Need to find something to do or I'm gonna go insane . http://chatter.com/a/fk1s3?ref=nf 
Without you is how I disappear , \ 
And live my life alone forever now . \ 
And without you is how I disappear , \ 
And live my life alone forever now . 
Anyone want to kill me ? http://chatter.com/a/fkdzk?ref=nf 
Feel sick , can't sleep , need to find something to keep me busy but nothing helps . 
Walking down to Edmonds beach , Be at the one by the dog park if anyone cares . http://chatter.com/a/fkfor?ref=nf 
connotation's fail . 
Speak to me\ 
So I can understand your tongue\ 
You seem rather fragile\ 
It's been said\ 
It ' ... http://chatter.com/a/frd02?ref=nf 
Ask me something im bored . http://chatter.com/a/g579f?ref=nf 
Making people to replace the old\ 
Sad to do but true to the soul\ 
Not alone or afraid\ 
But missing things from yesterday 
Slept too much and now i cant sleep no more . 
Nigga technology is anything that doesn't plug into a printer ... You know why ? Nigga's ain't got shit to print . 
I am not afraid to keep on living\ 
I am not afraid to walk this world alone \ 
< PROPFEMALE > if you stay , I'll be forgiven\ 
Nothing you can say can stop me going home 
Need something to do . http://chatter.com/a/gg2ti?ref=nf 
Other people's suffering is my entertainment as of late . 
Going walking if anyone wants to do something Text me . 
Today turned out pretty fucking sick ! http://chatter.com/a/ghmdl?ref=nf 
Cuz the truth hurts the world is a hard and lonely place and nobody gets anything for free , You know what else one day everyone you know and love is going to die ! 
I finally put it all together , \ 
But nothing really lasts forever\ 
I had to make a choice that was not mine , \ 
I had to say goodbye for the last time 
I don't wanna live to waste another day\ 
Underneath the shadow of mistakes I've made\ 
' C ... http://chatter.com/a/h09ab?ref=nf 
I am the mastermind\ 
Intelligent by design\ 
It makes me wanna cry\ 
And now that I'm satisfied\ 
It's time to say goodbye 
Lord I can’t disguise\ 
The look inside my eyes\ 
The more I try to look away the more I’m staring\ 
But now I need an answer to my prayers and you’re not there\ 
So why I think you listen 
If I spoke to you , would you listen to my language or would you listen to my words ? 
This is a sad song with nothing to say \ 
About a life long wait for a hospital stay\ 
And if you think that I'm wrong , \ 
This never meant nothing to ya 
If the end is so much better , why don't we just live forever ? 
Living life like a meerkat is not necessarily bad but you have to remember to keep a good lookout or you will miss it . 
Just won a trip to the Caribbean for 2 who wants to come ? 
Luck is not a gift but a curse for the hidden . http://chatter.com/a/hu7qu?ref=nf 
Wading through the desert of memory , trying to find the oasis of my life . 
Like the angel you are laugh creating\ 
A lightness in my chest , \ 
Your eyes they penetrate me , your answer's always ' maybe'\ 
That's when I got up and left\ 
And each and everyday will lead into tomorrow\ 
Tomorrow brings one less day without you\ 
But don't wait up just leave the light on\ 
' Cause all the roads that I might take \ 
Will all one day lead back to you 
Could you tell me again what you did this for ? 
I'll write you a poem , \ 
A poem with a twist , \ 
I'll write it with a razor blade , \ 
I'll write it on my wrist . 
Wondering if I'm reading to much into things like I tend to do . Or if I should take the < PROPMALE > , open the line and try to connect . But what if I'm wrong , what if all I do is bother you with my small attempts . 
I know how to show them , \ 
I know what they want , \ 
Blood from me , \ 
All to see , \ 
I'll give them one last thought . 
Mesmerized \ 
In your taste\ 
Dream greater\ 
Bigger and more\ 
In agony\ 
I will be a symphony 
What guides your vision\ 
What holds the balance\ 
Don't think that I can't see you shake and tremble\ 
Well I know your nervous this world is scary\ 
You have to let go all the madness you < PROPFEMALE > 
Give me a chance , \ 
I'll show you what i believe to be romance , \ 
If you say no tonight , \ 
I'll never be your knight , \ 
Once with a broken dream , \ 
I hope you never steam , \ 
My life is lost , \ 
Don't turn to dust . 
Why can't I forget about you ? \ 
Have you forgotten me ? \ 
Is there any Chance , \ 
For you to believe that I am sorry ? \ 
Did I have to make you chose ? \ 
What is it that I did ? 
Best Of Me --- Listen , Learn , Live . 
The past has been written , \ 
Our future remains hidden , \ 
Fakers fade leaving a stain , \ 
The ones true remain , \ 
A thought that won't move , \ 
Getting along the grove , \ 
Everything is planned , \ 
Including your End . 
It's so hard to say that I'm sorry , \ 
I'll make everything alright\ 
All these things that I've done , \ 
Now what have I become , \ 
And where'd I go wrong ? 
This place is so empty , \ 
My thoughts are so tempting , \ 
I don’t know how it got so bad . \ 
Sometimes it’s so crazy , \ 
that nothing can save me , \ 
But it’s the only thing that I have . 
Label me , that's fine , I'll be somebody else \ 
Lie about my life , have a story to tell \ 
Oh you're so insightful , let me remind you to twist and break me , \ 
should make you worried \ 
Two-faced liar , don't try and know me , \ 
deceit brings fire , makes sure you can't breathe . 
Death is not the greatest loss in life . The greatest loss is what dies inside us while we live . 
Somebody should tell us , right at the start of our lives , that we are dying . Then we might live life to the limit , every minute of every day . Do it ! I say . Whatever you want to do , do it now ! There are only so many tomorrows . 
Death does not concern us , because as long as we exist , death is not here . And when it does come , we no longer exist . 
I believe that imagination is stronger than knowledge - myth is more potent than history - dreams are more powerful than facts - hope always triumphs over experience - laughter is the cure for grief - love is stronger than death . 
The dreamer dies , but never dies the dream , Though Death shall call the whirlwind to his aid , Enlist men's passions , trick their hearts with hate , Still shall the Vision live ! Say nevermore , That dreams are fragile things 
Time is up , take your shot . \ 
' Cause your story's all you got . \ 
Don't back down , don't say no . \ 
Just stay still and let go . \ 
All this pressure that surrounds you'\ 
Holds you down but you know\ 
You've gotta break through . 
How many nights must I endure\ 
this nightmare that never ends ? \ 
How much longer must I accept\ 
this gift that the night always sends ? 
Eating my heart up , one sad moment at a time . http://chatter.com/a/kr3uw?ref=nf 
Time , its been so long\ 
And now there's nothing to say\ 
I'm trying so hard to find the words to say\ 
I'm tired of being , now I'm something I'm not\ 
I can't believe and I never thought\ 
Days would come to an end\ 
Well maybe someday we'll meet again\ 
If ever that day never comes\ 
It would be too soon 
The Rules :\ 
1 : Stay on the path\ 
2 : Be sinfully fun\ 
3 : Don't judge \ 
4 : Don't listen to the anonymous\ 
5 : Stay true\ 
6 : Stay insightful 
I want you to know\ 
With everything I won't let this go , these words are my heart and soul\ 
I'll hold on to this moment you know , ' cause I'd bleed my heart out to show\ 
And I won't let go 
All\ 
Life \ 
Is\ 
Cold \ 
Evil 
S . I . M . P . L . E . \ 
Someone\ 
Involved\ 
Might\ 
Prolong\ 
Lethal \ 
Ending 
We're mad with regret\ 
Memories that we'll both forget\ 
So far it's been so hard\ 
To cover up these scars\ 
I see this falling apart\ 
It's easy to just let it go\ 
No luck between us both\ 
So I keep waitingBut not with this\ 
So now I'll leave with 
May I hold you\ 
As you fall to sleep , \ 
When the world is closing in\ 
And you can't breath . \ 
May I love you . \ 
May I be your shield . \ 
When no one can be found , \ 
May I lay you down . 
Well this is a call \ 
Throughout and across \ 
The underdog nation \ 
The hopeless and lost \ 
' Cause we're not the ones \ 
To walk with the dead \ 
Disciples of no one \ 
By no one we're led \ 
Don't worry about me \ 
I'm not your tragedy \ 
A reject , no respect 
Way down deep inside there is a real me\ 
I'm always gonna hide and this is who you'll see\ 
Never gonna find me 
Drawn together\ 
Painter's brush stroke\ 
Sleight of hand\ 
We won't go up in smoke\ 
Fates colliding\ 
Love undying 
Who knows how long I've been lost in the dark ? \ 
Followed closely by the footsteps of my failures , \ 
What can I do to alter my perception , \ 
Of the way and the truth ? 
Most people don't aim to high and miss , \ 
Most aim to low and hit . 
A hand that stabs in the back , is a hand to keep at your front . 
Show me how to lie\ 
You’re getting better all the time\ 
And turning all against the one\ 
Is an < PROPMALE > that’s hard to teach\ 
Another clever word\ 
Sets off an unsuspecting herd\ 
And as you step back into line\ 
A mob jumps to their feet\ 
Now dance fucker dance\ 
Man he never had a chance\ 
And no one even knew\ 
It was really only you 
Take action , \ 
Repent now , \ 
The time is coming , \ 
Thy life is fading , \ 
Don't regret , \ 
Live now ! 
Live as if you were to die tomorrow . Learn as if you were to live forever . 
The world knows not of you when you are born , \ 
When you die will it have changed or not ? 
I'm looking at you through the glass , \ 
Don't know how much time has passed , \ 
Oh god it feels like forever\ 
But no one ever tells you that forever feels like home , \ 
Sitting all alone , \ 
Inside your head . 
This is my life , \ 
It's not what it was before , all these feelings I've shared , \ 
And these are my dreams that I've never lived before , \ 
Somebody shake me ' cause I , I must be sleeping ... 
Will you look into my eyes ? \ 
Will you listen to my words ? \ 
Will you give yourself the best ? \ 
Will you try just for me ? 
Back away from me you know little , \ 
Hid inside I stay at bay , \ 
I know to try and be open , \ 
But the door is stuck and I need help , \ 
Don't let the little things eat you for they will , \ 
And don't leave without a word of wisdom , \ 
Come away and then back to a vision , \ 
The true inspiration is the goal , \ 
Time is a key to all your questions , \ 
Ask me now this is your < PROPMALE > to listen , \ 
Open me up so I can be free . 
The act of living , \ 
Is the act of dieing slowly . 
What day is it ? And in what month ? \ 
This clock never seemed so alive , \ 
I can't keep up and I can't back down , \ 
I've been losing so much time . 
When do we come to , and where do we go after we are there ? \ 
How often do we enjoy , dose it affect how often do we sulk ? \ 
Why is there the pain , and why do we bother ? \ 
Is it just for you , or is it just because ? \ 
What would it take to show you that everything is nothing and nothing is everything ? \ 
What would it take to make you look at me , and not just what you hear ? \ 
When is the time to ask , and when do we leave ? 
Siting\ 
Waiting \ 
Watching 
When where you last unsure ? \ 
When where you last sad ? \ 
When where you last alone ?

Prove to me there is a reason to keep on living . You got 7 days . 
Prove to me there is a reason to keep on living . You got 6 days . 
Prove to me there is a reason to keep on living . You got 5 days . 
Walking for a goal . 
Deep inside your head\ 
There's a hole you don't want to see\ 
Every single night\ 
What you say makes no since to me . 
Lately , \ 
I'm not quite myself . \ 
Maybe , \ 
I do need some help . \ 
just my confusion , \ 
trust my delusions . \ 
Don't you , \ 
Regret you met me . \ 
go through , \ 
These steps to get me , \ 
Back to where we start , \ 
Before I fall apart . 
Thinking about starting a small business , looking into a building ... 
I believe it’s my god-given right\ 
To destroy everything in my sight\ 
It never gets dull , it never gets old\ 
The only it gets is more bold\ 
Drinkin’ , fightin’ , goin’ to the game\ 
In our world it’s a way to stay sane\ 
If you’re askin’ me , to have it my way\ 
I’d say that’s one fine day 
And I just can't look its killing me\ 
And taking control\ 
Jealousy , \ 
turning saints into the sea\ 
Swimming through sick lullabies\ 
Choking on your alibis\ 
But it's just the price I pay\ 
< PROPFEMALE > is calling me\ 
Open up my eager eyes\ 
' Cause I'm Mr Brightside 
Bored out my mind ganna go walking for a few hours . 
Home , Still bored , not tired at all , the beach is nice at night . 
Though you hear me\ 
I don't think that you relate \ 
My will is something\ 
That you can't confiscate\ 
So forgive me , but I won't be frustrated\ 
By destruction in your eyes\ 
As you're starin ' at the sun 
One day your life will flash before your eyes . Make sure its worth watching . 
Wondering if they are still thinking the same thing , or if the < PROPMALE > has been lost . 
Hungry , but nothing worth making at my house .

Don’t ask what the world needs . Ask what makes you come alive , and go do it . Because what the world needs is people who have come alive . 
Don't < PROPMALE > a dream . Hop on and ride it .

I know that you believe you understand what you think I said , but I'm not sure you realize that what you heard is not what I meant . 
I am so clever that sometimes I don't understand a single word of what I am saying . 
Just because I have to keep moving , doesn't mean that you can't come with me . :) 
Remember when there was nothing else to do , but lie in bed and , wonder how it was always up to you , and no one else and , Early mornings , late by warnings , what's the point of the alarm that I'm ignoring ? It's even raining , I'm not complaining , but waking up is hard to do so ...

When you are taken down , bring them down with you . 
Wake up in the morning , know Im gonna feel great\ 
Smokin on the < PROPMALE > and exhale all the hate\ 
Feeling the vibing of a glorious day\ 
Liven the life of the budsmokers way\ 
I celebrate our one life\ 
Living it up with no strife\ 
Hoping to never feel the time\ 
As i smoke this dime\ 
The day is almost done\ 
Now its time to run\ 
Getting tired and going to bed \ 
The day is done when i lay down my head
