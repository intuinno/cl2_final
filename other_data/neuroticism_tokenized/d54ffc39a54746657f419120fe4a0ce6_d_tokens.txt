A true friend doesn't care when you're broke , what you weigh , if your house is a mess , about your past , or if your family is filled with crazies . They love you for who you are . A true friend can go long periods of time without speaking to you and never question the friendship . Repost if you have at least one true friend . They will know who they are :)

put this on your status if you know or love someone who is gay . My wish is that people will understand that being gay is not a disease or a choice -People who are gay are not looking for a cure , they are looking for ACCEPTANCE and EQUAL RIGHTS . 93% won't copy and paste this . Will ......... you make it your status for at ... least ... one hour ? Promote Love & Acceptance ! NOT hate . Period .
