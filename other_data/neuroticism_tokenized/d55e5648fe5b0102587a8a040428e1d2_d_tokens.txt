School was awesome . then I came home and my sister was being a jerk and we got in a fight so now I am stuck in my room for now . I still don't see how being sent to my room is a punishment but fine with me . as long as I am away from the evil bratty one ! 
I've been online for god knows how long . I have a headache and I think possibly a fever but I am DEFINITELY coming to school tomorrow no worries . School today was awesome .. idk what happened when I got home . just a < PROPMALE > crash . I need plans for the weekend ( < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > , em , kels , < PROPFEMALE > , etc ... ) because if I don't I might have to go to monster mini golf with my sister and her friends alone and that would freaking suck ! 
Why . No . Not even why ! How long : :'( 
Better . Not the best , but better . Glad I got some questions answered 
Today was eh . Not bad not good . Choir was awesome though . Apparently < PROPFEMALE > counted to 10 in math class XD

Back from a weekend at < PROPFEMALE>'s . Just discovered that I don't have the right thing to do the science homework and I apparently didn't save the social studies thing we had to do which makes me mad . If it doesn't rain I get to go < PROPFEMALE > out with < PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE > at the park later ... 
Now im eating Hershey's kisses and getting on polyvore .... you know you're jealous . just thought I would let you facebookians know ... peace ! :D 
Went to the park and watched < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPMALE > , and < PROPFIRST > play basketball and froze to death . But still an extremely good day :D 
Had another good day . < PROPMALE > out with < PROPMALE > at the park and then he came over and taught me how to dance . That was interesting . I still have to do my foldable for science but other then that nothing . I might do that in English because we are just going over the MLA format thingy .

I wanna try and ride my new bike today too . and sadly I must clean my room . Bleh . i don't think I will get on again tonight .... 
I AM SOOOO DOOMED ! I cleaned my entire room and I still have not managed to find my < PROPMALE > project so I either left it on the bus , dropped it somewhere between my bus stop and my house , or it's somewhere in my house and I just haven't found it . Either way I am sooo doomed ! 
Okay I haven't been on in a while . So yeah I found my < PROPMALE > project and so I wasn't doomed . Um , haning out at the house today . I don't know if I am going skating or not yet . 
Well I ended up getting a ride to go to the skating thing and it was fun until the end of the night . I can't believe that he tore a ligament in his knee :( at least it isn't broken !

First half of the day sucked then I realized I shouldn't let you get to me so I was hyper and had fun the rest of the day . I am more worried then angry because there has got to be a reason he isn't talking to anyone .... 
So much confusion . The more answers I get the more questions keep popping up . I don't know who to trust so I am seriously just waiting until I hear from him . Until then I am not listening to anything anyone says ... 
Weekend is finally here . Not much tonight . Tomorrow and Sunday shall be fun though . I wish he would get his phone back soon .... :/ 
We lost because I had no freaking help on offense . I am still livid ! My knee hurts ... Oh well school tomorrow sigh relationships are difficult and I'm not even in one !

Done with math finally . Now for social studies . Gosh dang I hate homework ! 
I finished my outline !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Wooooohooooooo ! 
I memorized Rock , Paper , Scissors , Lizards , Spock !!!! : Scissors cuts paper , paper covers rock , rock smashes lizard , lizard poisons spock , spock vaporizes scissors , scissors decapitates lizard , lizard eats paper , paper disproves spock , and how it has always traditionally been rock crushes scissors ! ( and that was not copied from a website ... is it weird that I am so proud of myself for this ??? lol ) 
got two more goals and an assist . not bad for a scrimmage ( it doesn't count as a game , that was complete crap ! ) Now my stats are 10 goals and 3 assists this season . :D 
Arguing with < PROPMALE > about ... well .... I don't even remember what we were originally arguing about lol .... but it's getting interesting .... party AGAIN later which I don't wanna go to ..... oh well .... 
Soccer game ; Annoyed ; Nothing later ; text me 
Well we won ... but we did have a scare . I wish that game had never ended it was soooo fun . Whatever complaints I had about soccer previously have all vanished . I forgot how much better games are . The rain was also a nice touch I thought . Now I am up to 4 assists and 11 goals . Eat it < PROPMALE > ! and btw touche ! LAS PINAS ! lol .... still hyper !!!!! :D 
Less hyper ... but I had tacos for dinner which makes everything right in the world :) it seriously doesn't feel like I have to go to school tomorrow . I hope everything about Friday works out ! That would just make my entire week !

well ... today was a success (: 
My dearest sister , you left your facebook < PROPFEMALE > up ! You always yell at me for doing that so know what you have been hacked ! \ 
Love you , Kelsee (: 
okayy so , if anyone tries to attack me and chop me up into little pieces and throw me in the trash and put my head on a stake outside the school , I am totally going to apparate to get away ... fun times after play practice with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > 
Loves feeling sick ... Not ! No play practice for me tonight .. 
so ... I'm the idiot who left her phone in her locker ... AGAIN ... sigh ... no texts because you won't get an answer ... 
hates how she can never forget about certain things and certain people .. even when she really needs to .. 
well ... my facebook chat isn't working ... so if you wanna talk send me a message :) 
shouldn't I be happy about this ? apparently not ... 
feels like she is going to be sick ... but is too wired to go to bed ... even if it IS after midnight .. thank god tomorrow is Saturday and i get to have < PROPFEMALE > Cantrell over (: 
well ... today is going to be .... interesting ... hopefully everything will turn out as planned ? for once ... chat and texting are out ... send me a message if you wanna talk (:

PeeWee's Big Adventure is one of the weirdest movies I have seen in a while ... whoever wrote that movie was DEFINITELY on heavy drugs or something ...

well ... this is nice (: 
BOILER UP !

so ... am I the only one who thinks hand ball is freaking awesome ! haha

School + bad mood + not feeling well = most likely a bad day 
so today turned out okay ... talking on the phone made my night though :) 
FINALLY got the stupid metal connectors in my mouth out (: Megans house later :D 
so ... the Beauty and the Beast ranks among the top of my favorite disney < PROPFEMALE > movies :) 
so ... I have this monster of a headache and it's insanely annoying ... play practice later ... joy .. 
so ... today has been really weird ... and I don't know if that's a good or bad thing ... 
better mood since I've been home ... I love how gorgeous it is outside ... I DON'T love the fact that Mr. Schaefer sent an ungodly amount of homework home for me to do tonight so I can't go outside :\\ 
Awesome weekend (: bum all day today though ... 
just because I am not always smiling or I am less talkative then normal does not mean I am in a bad mood ... the fact that I kept getting asked if I was in a bad mood put me in the bad freaking mood ... 
well ... the nap thing didn't happen ... and since I had absolutely nothing better to do I liked a bunch of links , watched pointless videos on youtube , posted a billion music videos , and wrote this status ... I have no life ... 
ZOMG ! My sister is actually READING a book ... It's a spring break miracle ! Haha love ya kels (; 
SPRING BREAK ! * using deep manly voice * haha ... should be good ... I hope

I want to wear your sweatshirt to bed ; \ 
Watch scary movies with you ; \ 
Hold hands ; \ 
Kiss you in the rain ; \ 
Go on long walks with you ; \ 
Laugh until I can't breathe ; \ 
Make you watch chick flicks ; \ 
Talk on the phone till sunrise ; \ 
Play your favorite video games ; \ 
Build a fort and have a snowball fight ; \ 
Sneak out at night to look at the stars with you ; \ 
I want to fall hopelessly in love with you <3 
Tornado Sirens !! dun dun dunnnn 
If I had a single flower for every time I think about you , I could walk forever in my garden 
; love is knowing all about someone , and still wanting to be with them more than any other person , love is trusting them enough to tell them everything about yourself , including the things you might be ashamed of , love is feeling comfortable and safe with someone , but still getting weak knees when they walk into a room and smile at you (: 
haha ... the 3 people I wanted to go home were in the bottom 3 and FINALLY Stefano went home ... YES !! :D 
I wish I had the words to describe how angry and disappointed I am .. People suck 
\How can I stand here with you and not be moved by you ? \ 
Don’t you wanna stay here a little while ? \ 
Don’t you wanna hold each other tight ? \ 
Don’t you wanna fall asleep with me tonight ? \ 
We can make forever feel this way\ 
Don’t you wanna stay ? 
Absolutely cannot watch the Deathly Hallows without crying when Dobby dies :( 
Dwight : Thanks for meeting me\ 
< PROPFIRST > : Are you kidding ? I'd come anywhere to see a turtle . Where'd you find him ? \ 
Dwight : There's no turtle < PROPFIRST > . I just wanted to get you here\ 
< PROPFIRST > : Ugh c'mon you know me Dwight\ 
Dwight : I do know you < PROPFIRST > . I'm your righthand guy . I can't be the right hand to a new guy\ 
< PROPFIRST > : Now I'm going to have to go online and look at turtles or else I'm going to be off the whole day
