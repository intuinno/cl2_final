More than ever , we have big houses and broken homes , high incomes and low morale , more comfortable cars and more road rage . We excel at making a living but often fail at making a life . We celebrate our prosperity , but yearn for purpose . We < PROPFEMALE > our freedoms but long for connection . Materialistic things fail to satisfy . I love psychology . :)
