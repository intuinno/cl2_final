Hello to my neglected Facebook < PROPFEMALE > . ._. 

Facebook confuses me -_- . 
Trying hard to be enthusiastic ... 
Tired of fighting , wants to stop , tower has collapsed . 
This is getting ridiculous . 
It's better after the second bottle . Ugh , fucking caps . 
Side affects will vary . 
< PROPFEMALE > edited his profile ? Haha . 
Check stuff , reply to a couple things , torture myself a bit , go home . How interesting . 
Official site will be updated on August 6th . So , you have her in your inner circle , but not me ? I've done more , I've sacrificed more , I didn't have to give you the things I've given you , but I wanted to , for you . I wonder if you believed the truth . I feel 
New photo shoot up of my mohawk . 
* Sigh . * Must attempt to keep leftover happiness alive . 
Registration fucked , trying again tomorrow , Mother will probably mess up again and then blame me for shit . Ugh , People = Shit by Slipknot in the brain . 
Alien snuggles . :3 
Loves her alien :) . 
The lock has been raped . 
Wishes that she could do something with this month , no Daddy for Halloween ? But it's our holllliiiidaaaayyyyyy . :( 
Hates her brain for indefinite guilt trips . 
Ahh . That , new computer , broke and enjoying it smell . 
is a fat faggot in a leather jacket . 
Raur . 
Computer's in for repairs , has been in for repairs , blarg . Two weeks more . 
I'm back ._. . 
Will now search for all her friends and go on an adding spree , just because I can do that . Maybe that'll motivate me to come here more often . 
We'll just see how this goes . I'd much rather just stay where I'm at , really . LJ links may or may not be coming soon . 
Only good thing that happened about today : Dr. Naasz's dancing . Amusing yet pissed off worthy thing that happened about today : Mother's angry at all her kids because of our child output not matching hers . Okay , so you're mad that we don't fuck like a pig in heat like you do , Mother ? Hahaha , the lulz . 
Dance , dance . Here we go again , < PROPFEMALE > , there goes the white rabbit . 
Well I guess I'm just stupid then , aren't I , Mother ? Here's a hint , go fuck a stranger , just like you always used to , and roll in your own filth . Filthy cuntrag . As for the general public , over the summer , I can't stay here , I'll end up pulling her head off . 
Ah , Day of Silence , great aspect , BRIDGES . Full of sweet and interesting people . Well . The ones that I talked to . Feel free to add me , don't be scared . Stalk me , cook me , eat me , bury remains . 
What is life ? Life is a perception of your own reality . What is reality ? 
Ah , how to do this publically . Sometime , in the next month , I'll be announcing something , and setting stuff up . BRIDGES people ( two of you ? ) , I'll be showing up on Wednesdays , thank you . As well as a big thank you to my group of real friends in school , photo . 
\APPLE OF DISCORD :\ 
Is making a list of people I need to shoot with late this summer/beginning of school next year . Photographer(s ) will , in all probability , be paid . We'll see what happens . 
Fuck . My . Life . I bought the wrong fucking discs for three video projects . FML . 
My eyes ... I think they just died , as did my ears ... My friends are awesome like that , killing sensory . ._. 
Another bad week . Soon to be topped by an even worse weekend . Just like the week before that ... and the week before that ... and people wonder why I hate weekends ... two words : My Mother . Thanks for the lies of help to get me to come here , really . I'm never moving anywhere for anyone again . Anyone that ever got my to move to where they were did it all through lies . Disgusting . If I even make it through High School ... 
Hormonal outdraft , coming soon . 
But I like my kibbles and bits . 
If you need to know , I've just started on my breakdown . 
Scratch . Bite . Omnoms . 
Leave it to me to be stupid . 
* Sigh . * Another day where I'll wait to get out so I can speak to you again . ? 
Raurraurraurraurraur . :p Please get on ?
