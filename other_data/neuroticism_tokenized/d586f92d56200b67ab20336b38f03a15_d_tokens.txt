had a $0.50 cone and a mcdouble . tasted incredible . :) yum 
Went to see Clash of the Titans yesterday . Good Movie . My whole family went and my uncle < PROPMALE > came too . It was a great time . 
“There comes a time when you have to stand up and shout :\ 
This is me damn it ! I look the way I look , think the way I think , feel the way I feel , love the way I love ! I am a whole complex package . Take me ... or leave me . Accept me - or walk away ! 
enjoying my pool ! the water is clear and the perfect temperature . 
Rode my dirtbike and let my lil brother < PROPMALE > ride it for the first time . Today was fun swimming , dirtbike , and my friend < PROPMALE > was over . 
Going to the air show . My little brother < PROPMALE > broke his leg yesterday from riding the Dirtbike 
back from the airshow . saw the blue angels . am slightly sun burnt , but not to bad . i saw the jet powered school bus . it was pretty cool . had a mcdonalds ice cream cone on the way back it was tasty and cold . 
Fresh picked sweet corn ! The best ever ! Walk two houses , to grandpa's feild and pick the corn and then have it within that same hour for dinner . Delicious !!! 
Went to the cave . It was really nice seeing old friends again . Brought back a lot of great memories . Can't wait to go back again . The Lewisburg Haunted Cave ! 
Spilled out on my relatives dirt bike and now I have a big scrape on my left elbow and a bruised left calf muscle . Had fun doing it though . 
Had the best weekend in a long time . It was totally wicked ! :) 
Worked on my eagle project and watched the movie \500 Days of Summer\ " again . " 
Another movie packed weekend . So far I'v watched Lady in the Water , Made of Honor , Wanted , < PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland , Knowing , and El Dorado . 
Just finished the movie Obsesed . It was really CREEPY ! Cause it could so happen . Now going to watch Mirrors . You have got to love watching scary movies were the characters make the stupid obvious mistakes . 
Last night I watched the movie Mirrors . It was supposed to be a scarry movie but it didn't seem that way too me . I guess working at the hounted cave of Lewisburg cures you of being scared any more .
