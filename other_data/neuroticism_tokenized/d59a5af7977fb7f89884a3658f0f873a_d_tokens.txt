46 yrs ..... damn ! 
My head is running about stupid shit . Shit that shouldn't even matter . How do I stop it ..... EEEEKK 
& I love < PROPFIRST > Brinkley 
I miss my skittles ....... 
just when you think things couldnt ( or shouldnt ) get any worse , your meds stop working .............. YIKES !!!!! 
Blessings come from unexpected places sometimes ...... thank god for sobriety !!!! 
Sooooo bored ...... 
had a rollercoaster of a day today .... yuck ! worst part is I hurt someone VERY dear to me , even though unintentional it still hurts . I AM SOOO VERY SORRY < PROPFIRST > !! 
Had a good day today ..... alone time , girl time ( both much needed ) . Then my man took me to dinner & the my outpatient group . My mind is clear for a change .... still A LOT going on up there though ( wish that would stop , but whatever ) . Its nice to have some clarity ( if only for a while ) :o ) 
Bored as hell .... where is everybody ? Why doesn't everyone keep my hours ? Lol 
sober & learning to love life 
just went hiking out behind our house .... i love it here !!! 
there's no place like home .... there's no place like home .... 
for once it feels good NOT to belong ...... 
im not sure what to think or what to feel ..... my head is spinning & im not sure what about 
serenity ..... even in the eye of the storm 
i hope everybody had a great thanksgiving .............. i did !! 
Got a call from my best friend today ..... Actually felt like we were best friends again . Been missing u < PROPFIRST > !!!! I love you ! 
beginning to question ..... 
manic & having mixed feelings about it ...... I LOVE being manic , but my baby isn't loving it ! 
utilized my alone time ..... YAY ME !!! 
AAAHHHHH !!!!! 
im losing my mind .............. i need a mtg 
so I'm feeling empty & all alone & lost ..... so I do what is suggested of me ( to pray ) & I still feel lost & alone , but the emptiness is less ..... when does this hole fill up ? 
feeling productive today ...... got some stuff done ( kinda ) . then stopped to paint my nails & now im stuck feeling productive & not being able to do anything .......... lol 
big difference from how i was feeling yesterday ............. guess there is something to be said about this praying stuff :o ) 
sitting @ starbucks ........ bored as can be !! thank God for group tonight 
getting about that time ........... i wonder if my insurance will be accepted or not . \ 
i wonder if they got the whole outpatient program weeks approved at the same time ( im hoping ) or if they get it approved week by week . cuz my insurance is done :o ( 
I'm freaking out ! starting to calm down some ...... THANK GOD FOR MY SPONSOR !! 
i had the BESTEST day ever today !!! my BFF came to see me :o ) it felt like old times again ! \ 
THANK YOU ALEX .... IT MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD TO ME & MADE MY DAY !!! I LOVE YOU <3 
I AM SOOOO PROUD OF YOU < PROPMALE > !!!! 
TODAY I TOOK MY 90 DAY CHIP ! YAY ME !!! \ 
today i am grateful for my sobriety & being able to enjoy life today out of the fog of my addiction . 
did not have a good day today .... bits & pieces were ok ( meaning they didnt suck ) changing meds blows 
day w/a friend , church , a real < PROPFIRST > brown tree , CPK & the movies ? a greatly needed date night ! what a perfect day <3 
a friend of mine snatched up again ..... fuck this disease ! 
come home ..... 
y , when getting loaded is the FURTHEST thing from my mind am i kinda jealous when a friend of mine goes back out ? I hate this disease ! I want my head to stop too , but I don't get that option , nor do I want that option ...... but y does my first thought say \lucky\ " ? someone please ...... I can't sleep even . this shit isn't worth it anymore to me ! I'm confused . " 
I need to look @ y I want relief from my own head so I can fix that . cuz if I wasn't looking for relief from my own head than I wouldn't be jealous ..... & getting loaded is NOT an option for me anymore 
let's give this prayer thing a shot again ...... 
< PROPFEMALE > CHRISTMAS TO ALL MY LOVED ONES !! MAY U HAVE A GREAT DAY :O ) 
had a good day , but started missing my family ..... depression sets in . am @ the birthday mtg to pick up my 90 day chip ..... trying to pull myself out of this self-destructive attitude . hopefully this works . I hope y'all r having great times with whoever ur with . am grateful to be sober this year !
