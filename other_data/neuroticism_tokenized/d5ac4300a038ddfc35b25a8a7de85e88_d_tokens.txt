You are my light in the dark , you are the beating in my heart . But that is not enough , will i ever be by your side ? 
bHeld in place with paralyzing fear , i scream but can't be heard . I cry but can't be seen . I'm dying in a world that no one sees and no one feels the pain 
b . Slowly i loose all feeling and then the world fades away ... Freedom at last
