One of every 10 people born is gay . That means 1 of every 10 people is instantly put down , given bad labels , left alone , put in a minority , & so much else ... all for something they didn't ask for . Many gay teens are going to suicide as a way of escaping . If you want to tell them life will get better , and you respect them for who they are , copy & paste this . Most of you won't , but let's see the 5% who will . 
just got back from the depot with < PROPFEMALE > and all the kids and now they are taking a little nap before heading to allies 3rd birthday =) cant wait its going to be fun for sure

put this on your status if you know or love someone who is gay . My wish for 2010 is that people will understand that being gay is not a disease nor a choice - people who are gay are not looking for a cure but ACCEPTANCE and EQUAL RIGHTS ... 93% won't copy and paste this . Will you ... make it ... your status for at least one hour ? ....?... ... Promote LOVE & Acceptance , not hate .

Make this your status if you're proud to be a mom !? 
They say everlasting friends can go long periods of time without speaking & never question the friendship . These types of friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been or how far away they live and they don't hold grudges . They understand that .. life .. is busy but you will ALWAYS .. love them .. Re-post if you have at least 1 of these friends . 
so im in love with this amazing man ..... as i see it i have two options .... option one is to watch a man walk away that i could see myself with for the rest of my life ..... or option two run like hell after him ...... hmmmm this decision sucks but none the less i have made up my mind now lets just hope he likes my answer ?
