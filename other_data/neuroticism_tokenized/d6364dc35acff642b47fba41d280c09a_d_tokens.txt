Random Fact of the Day : \ 
A pussy that draws blood on a friend's little brother is bad . 
Random Fact of the Day :\ 
Despite popular belief , Pink is not a color because it has no wavelength of light . 
I need to quit being nocturnal ... Maybe if I stay awake as long as possible , when I actually fall asleep I'll sleep during the night . And NOT all day . Wish me luck ... 
Woke up at 4am cuz i was supposed to work at 5 .. Turns out my boss is sick . So no work today after all . Lets try again tomorrow . N_N 
is either really tired .. or is just having a depressing day . At this point I can't tell . 
Just had a really odd dream ... 
Going to Vantage to check out a campsite .. then my grandparents ' for a day or so . Too bad they're both a half hour away in different directions . x_x but then , at least its not another 3 hour drive . =| 
So close , no matter how far\ 
Couldn't be much more from the heart\ 
Forever trusting who we are\ 
And nothing else matters\ 
I never opened myself this way\ 
Life is ours , we live it our way\ 
All these words I don't just say\ 
Yeah , trust I seek and I find in you\ 
Every day for us something new\ 
Open mind for a different view\ 
Nothing Else Matters - Metallica 
Camping was fun , if somewhat different this time around . hahaha . had a freakin blast ! Nemo and Bj ... we should do this more often .. haha 
Who lives in a pineapple under the sea ? SpongeBob SquarePants ! Who died in the ocean because of BP ? SpongeBob SquarePants ! 
If friday the 13th is supposed to be unlucky .. then it must've been opposite day too . 
[ an empty space for my thoughts ... maybe I'll fill it in later ] 
If you forget to remember what you were supposed to remember to forget , does remembering to forget what you were remembering mean the same thing ? 
Has a Hollywood Undead song stuck in his head .. Had a fun day hanging with everyone . Living life .. But isn't really tired , and its past midnight . Eh .. No clue how I'm gonna be ready to wake up early when school starts . =/ 
Another day away from home .. It seems that I've been doing that alot lately . ;) 
Got a turtle .. it's still kinda nameless tho .. any suggestions ? 
Today was better than I would've thought . Had a blast hanging with everyone . Saw loads of people I haven't seen in forever .. Yeah , life's not perfect , but that doesn't mean it isn't worth the effort . 
Saturday , best day I've had in a while . Yesterday , not so much . Today , I feel like crawling into bed and sleeping all day .. 
School tomorrow ... >_> It's really gonna suck having to get up at 6:30 . If I'm not there , I didn't wake up . 
is tired .... 
Today was a surprisingly good day .. If only everyday was like this . School wouldn't be as annoying at the end of the year ... 
Gotta love an eventfull day hanging with friends , ( kinda ) going to a football game , and then a dance afterwards . Finally got home at 12:30 .. The first weekend of the school year is going great !! 
First Monday of the school year ... Not too bad . We'll have to see how the other Mondays turn out this year . 
Huh ... I'm way too out of it today .. I've been at a loss for what to say and do all day . Maybe I'm just tired ? Idk . v_v 
Today .. Tomorrow .. The next day .. The day after that .. You never know whats gonna happen next . 
I keep having the same dream over and over ... but , I finally got to sleep in today . (: Lol 
Wow , it's actually down pouring in Ellensburg .. Who would've guessed . It almost feels like home . 
Lightning , Thunder , and a hella lot of Rain . 1 word : Awesome ! 
So my computer's hard drive is officially burned out .... Gotta love checking Fb on the Wii . v_v 
And the week is halfway over ... Everything seems to be falling apart , but then , it hasn't been a bad week , mostly .. Eh , that's life . 
Absolutely nothing to do today .. -bored- 
Has anyone else got the random urge to play with fire in the middle of the night ? Or is it just me ? 
Doesn't have any sarcastic/deep/random thoughts at the moment .. 
So many things to do , and not enough time to do it . Just another one of the wonderfull things life throws at you .. 
Is definately not checking his facebook while he's late for school . [ Still waiting for a ride .. ] 
If you could change the past , would you ? Even if it meant changing who you are . 
Fixed my computer !! xD The only problem , is that it only works when it's laying on its side . 
Mondays ... why must they be so annoying ? >_> 
A smiley for each day of the week : ... \ 
Sunday xP Monday >_> Tuesday =/ Wednesday =| Thursday =) Friday =D Saturday xD 
is . . . alive . Yay ;) 
So after destroying 3 different civilizations , taking over the mediterranean sea , starting to colonize South < PROPFEMALE > , and taking over the Aztec/Maya/Inca , my game decides to freeze up on me and I lost all of it . >_> \ 
<_< \ 
>_< \ 
Well that was a waste of 3 hours .. Stupid computer . xP v_v 
My computer is acting just like my freaking razor ( phone ) .. >_> It works for maybe 5 minutes and then freezes up . <_< I have to try restarting it for 15 minutes before it works again . >_< I hate it . 
is . . . still alive . Yay again ;) 
Playing GuitarHero with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > . xP And have a really annoying thought on my mind .. v_v I need to do something , anything , about that ... 
Hmmmm ... It seems that not caring about my annoyances in life has made my day better . Cool . 
Like my status and I'll tell you :\ 
1 . Something I've learned about you from looking at your wall for 13 seconds . \ 
2 . The color you remind me of . \ 
3 . My first memory of you . \ 
4 . The animal you remind me of . \ 
5 . Ask something I've always wondered about you . \ 
6 . My favorite thing about you . \ 
7 . Give you a weird nickname . \ 
8 . Dare you to repost this ? 
Please copy and paste this to your status if you know someone , or have been affected by someone , who needs a smack upside the head . Lets raise awareness . 
Isn't doing anything for Holloween . At all . Fun . 
has decided that he needs a new profile pic . Sadly , he doesn't have any recent photos or a working camera . How sad . 
So I'm home , school was boring as hell , Mom went to the hospital ... I really don't want to deal with anything right now . Eh . I'm walking to 7/11 . Bye . 
\A word to the wise ain't necessary - it's the stupid ones that need the advice . \"- Bill Cosby " 
filled out an application today and when it said \In Case of Emergency Notify :\ " I said \ " Chuck Norris\ " what the hell is my mom gonna do ?! " 
Well that wasn't a possibility I was expecting to expect to happen relatively soon ... I don't know why tho , I probably should've ... Not even a month left to decide .. what should I do ? 
How much wood could a woodchop chop if a wood chop could chop wood ?? I've always wondered .. 
Just got a 24pack of Mt . Dew for babysitting my nieghbors kids for a while .. Score . 
The 4 day weekend is almost over .. how sad ='( 
Finally putting new music on my Ipod . Awesome x ] 
is blasting music through the house . Lets turn it up even louder , shall we ? 
Ugh .. I hate being stressed out ... 
I think someone almost burned the house down while I was sleeping .. There's tons of smoke in here . No kidding . 
So clever , whatever , \ 
I'm done with these endeavors . \ 
Alone I walk the winding way . \ 
( Here I stay)\ 
It's over , no longer , \ 
I feel it growing stronger . \ 
I'll live to die another day , \ 
Until I fade away . 
Music is my salvation .. 
I hate snow . And winter . Especially in Ellensburg . Because there's a ton of snow . And it's cold . >_< 
Happy Thanksgiving ! 
wonders about the chaos that would ensue if someone put a reverse button at the top of an escalator . 
Has lost all motivation . I don't know what to do anymore . 
Umbreon = Awesomeness 
Really needs a break right now . Ugh ... 
If toast always lands butter-side down and cats always land on their feet , what would happen if you strapped the toast onto the cat's back and dropped it ? 
Stupid facebook won't let me add \sarcasm\ " as one of my languages .. >_> Bad facebook . " 
So , at the threat of being run over ( which I'm sure is coming ) I've decided to join the number-status thingy craze that people seem to be doing .. Send a message to me w/ a number and I'll write what I think of you in my status . 
#7 You're a cool person and a friend , even if you occasionally threaten to run me over .. It's cool how you always threaten to run over people tho ( even if you are kidding about it .. most the time ) Lol . And we need to find time to < PROPFEMALE > cuz I never see you around anymore . 
Just because you finally joined the dark side , does NOT mean that we have to share our cookies ! All we said was that we have them . Not that we'd share them . 
Why is it that every freaking time I try to have a good day somebody or something always has to fuck it up ??????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
You ever have those days where you just don't give a shit about the world , and feel like wasting your time doing anything other than what you should be doing ? Yeah . I'm there . 
Just slept for almost 15 hours on my new couch .. That thing is comfy . xD 
You know , we grow up taught to believe that everyone's equal . That you are no better than anyone else . Of course that's a lie . Some ARE better than others . And those who recognize what makes them better and are able to exploit that , are the ones who succeed . 
I'm getting extremely tired of my life . Everyday I like it less , and everytime I think about it , I realize I'm runing out of reasons to not give up . 
Well it's officially winter break .. Stoked that I don't have school , but I'm not really looking forward to being at home for 2-1/2 weeks straight . Hopefully I'll survive with my sanity intact . 
I need something to do . 
If life has you down and out , try licking a power line . You'll be re-energized in no time ! 
\I close both locks below the window 
I gotta say , this Christmas is alot better than last year's . xD 
Learning how to play the guitar . Just got another one from my mom's friend . xD 
Can already play the intro to 4 different songs ( and Smoke on the Water of course ) . I love my guitar . xD 
Heading over to Snoqualmie for the week . Probably gonna < PROPFEMALE > with an old friend or two . 
Hanging with an old friend . But I hate the snow . As always . 
Just figured out that my amp can charge my iPod AND play it's music . xD 
Has to get up early tomorrow . < PROPFIRST > is coming over for the day . (: 
Let us give a moment to remember the millions who have given their lives so we could live today ... \ 
Thank you , Dinosaurs . We miss you . ),: 
is watching 1000 Ways To Die . Pretty awesome show . haha 
Sleeping all day was great .. But why did I have to wake up ? Reality sucks . v_v 
My family is just amazing ... not . Also , annoyed that I missed school 4 out of 5 days this week . 
Life is full of twists and turns and we're just along for the ride .. Let's see where it goes , shall we ? 
Dear Monday : I despise you . Please go away . If you have any questions or concerns , please contact Friday . Thank you 
Getting better at playing the guitar . Learned a couple new songs/intros . xD\ 
On the other hand , my homework isn't done and school has been sucking lately . =/ Oh well . 
Borrowing COD Modern Warfare for my Wii . Point , Aim , Click , and Shoot . Bye-bye people who are trying to kill me . ;) 
I felt the need to post a status . I just don't know what to say . I have a lot on my mind . But I can't say what I'm thinking . 
It's amazing how for every awesome person , every friend , in the world , there's that many more not-so-awesome people . I get the feeling that this is gonna be a long week ... 
I fucking hate my life . 
Life is like a roller coaster ; It's full of ups and downs , and sometimes you just have to hold on for dear life .. 
I try to make it through my life , in my way , there's you . \ 
I try to make it through these lies , that's all I do . \ 
Just don't deny it , \ 
don't try to fight this , \ 
and deal with it , \ 
and that's just part of it ... 
Filling out the first of many applications . Still need a personal contact . And does anybody know anywhere that's hiring ? 
My rollercoaster broke down at the bottom of it's track and all the engineers are taking a lunchbreak . Stay tuned for further developments . 
Home alone for the week . Everybody should randomly show up at my place tomorrow and we'll order a pizza or something !! Lol 
Bonfire was awesome . Now to watch The Hangover and stay up all night . Good times . xD 
One of my guitar strings broke :( sad day . Time to take out my spare guitar .. 
What's worse ? Saying something and regretting it ; or not saying something at all when you had the < PROPMALE > to ... 
It's Friday .. 1:20 in the morning and I'm wide awake .. FML . Hopefully today will be a good day . But knowing my luck , it probably won't . 
Spring break = no school ! (: but a week at home with my family and nothing to do ...? Not looking forward to that . 
Are things going to get even better ? Or are they fine just how they are ? I want things to improve but then I don't wanna risk what I already have . -sigh- That's life . 
U.S. military members are somewhere in the world tonight missing their family while you are safe at home . In the minute it takes you to read this , military members all over the world are not only saving lives , but also sacrificing their own life for your freedom . It's Military Appreciation Week . Re-post if you are in the military , love a military member , or appreciate our troops . 
The only thing in life that you absolutely have to do , is die . Everything else is negotiable . 
Dear Monday :\ 
Why must you hate me so much ? The only good thing about you is that I only see you once a week , and even that's more often then I'd like to . Well here goes nothing ... off to school I go . You better behave yourself today . x_x \ 
From Logan\ 
P.S. Please tell the weekend that we need to chill more often , thank you . 
Let's see how creative my Facebook friends are ...... Leave me a 1-word comment that best describes me using the FOURTH letter of YOUR LAST name .... It can only be 1 word ...... Then copy and paste this to your wall so I can leave a word about you ...... Don't just post a word & not copy ....... That's no fun ! GO repost this and see what you get . 
Feels like just crawling into bed and staying there for a week ... or a month ... or a year ... =/ 
Each day is a new day . But the more things change , the more things stay the same . And that's how the cookie crumbles .
