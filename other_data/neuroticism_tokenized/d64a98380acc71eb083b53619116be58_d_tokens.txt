If it's not real , you can't hold it in your hand , you can't feel it with your heart , and I won't believe it . But if it's true , you can see it with your eyes , oh even in the dark . And that's where I want to be , yeah . \

Going over to Kailas house tomarrow :D YAY ! 
Something takes a part of me . Something lost and never seen . Everytime I start to believe . Something's raped and taken from me ... from me . Life's gotta always be messing with me ( You wanna see the light ) . Can't they chill and let me be free ( So do I ) . Can't I take away all this pain ( You wanna see the light ) . I try to every night , all in vain ... in vain 
I'm feeling mean today . Not lost , not blown away . Just irritated and quite hated . Self control breaks down . Why's everyday so tame ? I like my life insane . I'm fabricating and debating who I'm gonna kick around . \ 
You open your mouth again . I swear I'm gonna break it . You open your mouth again . My God , I cannot take it . 
Hunting tomarrow morning , at four in the morning ... coldness ... 
Drop a heart , break a name . We're always sleeping in and sleeping for the wrong team . \ 
We're going down , down in an earlier round . And , Sugar , we're going down swinging . I'll be your number one with a bullet . A loaded God complex , cock it and pull it . 
You had your heart set on an angels kiss . Maybe a taste of bliss . \ 
Maybe a long white dress and a fist full of flowers . \ 
You wrapped your arms around a murderer , pretending it didn't hurt . \ 
Every time I cut you deeper and deeper . 
I really need to get pictures of me and my friends ... 
They need to put a ' Dislike Button ' on facebook ...

I'll be gone for a time , tuning out for a while . It's gonna look like I'm not all there . I've decided that today seems alright to piss away . Ignore my empty stare\ 
' Cause I'm just thinking about us I've been living in a dream about you and now I know you were all I ever wanted on my mind and if I never see my own reality . Well , I'm okay to leave it all behind . 
Ever wonder how people can lie to someones face , betray them because that lie was supposedly the truth , tell them they're sorry and feel bad but the lie was still true , and keep on betraying you ?
