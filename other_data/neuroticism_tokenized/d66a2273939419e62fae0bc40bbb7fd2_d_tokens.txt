\A man with one watch knows what time is it ... a man with two watches is never quite sure . \"" 
Back from Dorney Park , wooo ! 
Did you ever see one of those videos where you are asked to look for , or follow a specific thing through out the video ? Then , at the end , they reveal that as were watching , something large and intrusive moved around in plain sight and you never even noticed it . Its frightening how often that happens , like how I just moved from the doorway into your room as you read this . 
Anyone else got their work study thing back ? I'm placed at the learning resource center as a student assistant o.O
