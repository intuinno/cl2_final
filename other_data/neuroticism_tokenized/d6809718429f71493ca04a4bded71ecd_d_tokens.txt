My pretty mouth will frame the phrases that will disprove your faith in man 
Sweetness , sweetness I was only joking when I said I'd like to smash every tooth in your head .... Oh sweetness , sweetness , I was only joking when I said by rights you should be bludgeoned in your bed ... Bigmouth strikes again and I've got no right to take my place with the Human race 
I'm the kind to sit up in his room heart sick an ' eyes filled up with blue . When you came in the air went out . And all those shadows there filled up with doubt . I don't know who you think you are , but before the night is through , I wanna do bad things with you ... I wanna do real bad things with you . 
PONYO PONYO PONYO PONYO PONYO PONYO PONYO PONYO PONYO PONYO PONYO PONYO PONYO PONYO PONYO PONYO PONYO PONYO PONYO PONYO PONYO PONYO ( please ! i have been waiting for this movie for over a year !! and funny people too ) 
playing fetch with Nebula ( consists of me throwing her toy mouse across the room she then runs to retrieve it and bring it back to me ... we continue this cycle ) and organizing my pharmacy drawer ... why am i awake ? 
And when I'm lying in my bed I think about life and I think about death and neither one particularly appeals to me . And if the day came when I felt a natural emotion I'd get such a shock I'd probably lie in the middle of the street and die ...

class cancelled because our teacher has malaria ... should have seen the look on peoples faces before they knew it was not contagious ! 
I wrote a nasty letter and I sent it to the Lord I said don't you dare come and bother me no more . I had a good friend I could only destroy and lovers I loved less than anybody could afford . Baby don't you bother tasting the water , and baby don't you bother coming closer to me . Can you see my eyes ? They're half the size and I'm not able to look at you 
I may be lonelier now but I'm happy alone , honest . I ain't lonely alone , but what would we talk about anyway ? No , I'd never resort to kissing your photo , honest . I just had to see how the chemicals taste now , < PROPFEMALE > . Bite hard ... well i ... t's a broken smile , breaking their hearts , and breaking their minds ... ( damn it's been a year ... yippie !!! )

The symptoms of our getting older , the problems that say we don't mind , most of us never get over memories mingled with lies . Observing the process will change it , afterwords even if you subcounscioussly rearrange it , it doesnt seem any less true . And no one can tell me to listen , and no one can tell me what's right , cause nobody has my permission , and no one can see in your mind . 
I get up in the morning to the beat of the drum . I get up to this feeling , keeps me on the run . I get up in the morning , put my dreams away , I get up , I get up , I get up again . 
3 NIGHTS OF THE PIXIES in 3 2 1 ..... BLASTOFF !!! ( And I am getting paid ! ) 
You're so pretty when you're unfaithful to me ...

When your room looks kinda weird and you wish that you weren't there , Just close your eyes and make believe and you can be anywhere ... 
day 4 with the flu and the work keeps piling up , but my flu doesn't seem to be going away ... this is not a good mix 
I don't know why-yi-yi but dreaming's all I do . I won't get by-yi-yi on mere imagination . Upside down , bouncing off the ceiling inside out , stranger to this feeling . Got no clue what I should do I'll go crazy if I can’t get next to you . 
Tuco you will be so dearly missed , the best dog ever . I'll miss dancing with you ! 1997-2009 
Literature is the profession of the man who wishes to be useless to society and a burden to his relatives , and to die of hunger 
I toss and turn keep stressing my mind , I look for peace but I don't attain . Madness to magnet keeps attracting me , I'm on the move can't seem to shake the shade . Within my dreams I see the life I've made , the pain is deep a silent sleeper I won't hear a peep . Cuz day and night the lonely loner seems to free their mind at night they're all alone , some things will never change ... 
Talking shit about a pretty sunset blanketing opinions that I'll probably regret soon . I've changed my mind so much I cant even trust it . My mind changed me so much I cant even trust myself . 
is crying because of the support aspca commercial , if i didnt have 5 animals i rescued i would be getting a new one tomorrow . ( cats - were all abandoned in boxes at public places and were going to be taken to pound ... pug - was eating trash on the street filty ... puggle - was going to be killed at pound the next day ) GET AN ANIMAL FOR CHRISTMAS

died today 
When I read the words that it told me , it made me sad sad sad , But I still love you so I can't let you go , I love you- ooh baby I love you . Oh oh oh oh oh oh , Every breath I take oh oh oh oh oh Every move I make hey hey , Baby please don't go . 
And I saw little beams of light come into the bedroom , from underneath the door . And they crawled under my sheets , and they came out of every single pore . When I think about you , flowers grow out of my grave , grave grave ! 
had some much needed R&R ( ramen & rain ) with < PROPMALE > !

And distance will increase the danger , with certainties never enjoyed . Regarded as equal yet stranger , ignored , then embraced , then destroyed . Observing the process will change it , afterwords even if you subconscioussly rearrange it , it doesnt seem any less true . The remnants of fog disappearing , and even transcending concern , disturbing but somehow endearing , conditioned to never unlearn .

in bed with < PROPMALE > Kundera ... <3 
And she turned around and took me by the hand and said I've lost control again\ 
and how I'll never know just why or understand . She said I've lost control again and she screamed out kicking on her side and said I've lost control again and seized up on the floor . She said I've lost control She's lost control again 
And I'm not the kind that likes to tell you just what I want to do I'm not the kind that needs to tell you I've lost you ...

I don't want to get over you . I guess I should take Prozac , right , and just smile all night at somebody new , Somebody not too bright but sweet and kind who would try to get you off my mind . I could leave this agony behind but I don't want to get over you cause I don't want to get over love . I could make a career of being blue -- I could dress in black and read Camus , smoke clove cigarettes and drink vermouth
