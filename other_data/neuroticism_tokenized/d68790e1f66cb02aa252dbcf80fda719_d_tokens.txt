Ever see a crazy driver and tell yourself they're going to wreck ? Well , tonight I was coming home from Deltona and a car flew past me on Normandy . It ended up out of control and I watched it fly through the intersection at Graves and go right into the woods ! Fortunately both people were okay , even there dog . I spent the the better part of the hour holding puppy while 911 was summoned . DON\T DRINK AND DRIVE ! "

Working on the classroom kicked my butt today ! I don't know how many squats I did cleaning and filling the cabinets , but I can tell you it was TOO MANY ! 
I will not be sad . I will not be frustrated . I will not be sad . I will not be frustrated . I will release it . I will release it . I will release it . How long before I feel better ?

I know 97% will not repost this as their status , but I know that my friends will be one of the 3%and put this as their status for at least an hour .. in honor of those who died because of cancer or are still fighting it .... 
A true friend doesn't care when you're broke , what you weigh , if your house is a mess , about your past , or if your family is full of crazies . They love you for who you are . A true friend can go long periods of time without speaking to you and never question the friendship . Re-post if ... you have at least one true friend , they will know who they are !

“Dear God , my resolution for 2011 is a big fat bank account and a slim body . Please don’t mix these two up like you did last year . ”\ 
Mom , that's funny ! 
A true friend doesn't care when you're broke , being a bitch , doesn't judge you , what you weigh , if your house is a mess , what you drive , about your past , or if your family is filled with crazy people . Your conversations pick up where they left off , even if it has been months ( or even years ) apart . They love you ... for who you are . Re-post if you have at least ONE true friend . They will know who they are ? 
Just indulged in 4 pieces of marzipan covered in dark chocolate . Yum !! No more left or I'd keep going !! 
Dear FB friends , I've been a bit tart with my tongue this week . Please forgive me if I've called you a FREAK , a ( potentially ) broke bitch , or a wacko . I've been convicted ! I also apologize if I've made kicking your butt type threats . It's been a hard week for me . Must have been PMSing ! 
< PROPFEMALE > MUST get off FB ! The sun has come out !!! 
I am just so happy right now ! < PROPMALE > is with < PROPMALE > after 13 agonizing months ! Praise God !!!! Alive and well and getting hugged ... oh yeah and telling dad he looks like < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > !! haha ... Imagine !! 
Every New Year we reflect on those that are important to us . We look back over the years and feel grateful for the friendships we have made along the way . I am grateful for you my friends . Please help me celebrate our friendship by adding the years we’ve been friends under this posting . Then copy and paste to your profile so I may do the same .? 
What to do on a rainy day ??? SHOP of course ! 
RED BULL !!!! 
Please put this as your status for at least one hour if you , or someone you know has or had , an invisible illness ( Crohn's , Ulcerative Colitis , Rheumatoid Arthritis , Kidney Disease , Epilepsy , Fibromyalgia , MS , COPD , LUPUS , Diabetes , PSC ) . My one wish is that in 2011 a cure will be found !!! 
Speaking of adventures ... I got my leave ... another week of being spoiled !!!! 
A MOTHER'S PROMISE : I will stalk you , freak out on you , lecture you , drive you crazy , be your worst nightmare , embarrass you in front of your friends & hunt you down like a bloodhound .... because I LOVE YOU ! When you understand that , I will know you are a responsible adult . You will NEVER find someone who loves you , cares about you , and worries about you more than I do ! Copy & paste if you are a Mom ! 
Dear LORD ... Please bless the folks that keep kicking my butt at Scrabble ! 
Must catch the last of the sunshine ... can't believe it's going to freeze tonight ! 
Blessed is the man that endureth temptation : for when he is tried , he shall receive the crown of life , which the Lord hath promised to them that love him . < PROPFIRST > 1:12 
Off to the gym !!! Warm weather is right around the corner !!! ( Pumping myself up ! ) 
UGGGGHHHHHHH ... left for the ER with < PROPFIRST > yesterday afternoon ! Got home 5:13 this am !! After every test under the sun ... bloodwork , EKG , CAT , Lumbar , etc . and 12 hours ... a virus !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Looking to sell my chipper/mulcher . Know of anyone who may be interested ? ( B&S INTEK 7.0 ) Great for clearing property !! 
Okay ... I need tech advise . I was having an issue with these weird ( unsolicited ) photos cropping up under my profile , so I reported them and cleaned them off my site . Now I can't click on any photos and have them resize so I can actually see them !! They temp . disappear as soon as I click on them . I don't know if the two actions are related . Any ideas ?? 
A cancer patient only has one wish , to get better . I know that 97% of you won't post this as your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do . In honor of someone who died , or is fighting cancer , post 
I still need tech help !! Can't find a resolution to ALL pics disappearing from my view when I click on them . What could possibly be causing this ??? 
I am blessed in so many ways and right now I'm really feeling it !!! 
Still can't view pics and I'm starting to get really frustrated . Contemplating shutting down this site ... but then I'd have to relocate photos ... ugh .... don't really have time for that ... ( petty stuff , but annoying ... ) 
If you have a wonderful man , who helps balance your whole world ... who isn't perfect , but is perfect for you ... who works hard and would do anything for you . Who makes you laugh and drives you crazy , who is your best friend , who you want to grow old with , and who you are thankful for everyday , then post this as your status ! 
13 days and one wake up .... haha ! 
It's impassioned and ... it's red ! 
I am soooo tired ... definitely age ... although last nights hour + work out ( I'm still feeling it ! ) and today's all day trip to the zoo today probably played a part ! Tomorrow ... early a.m. workout ... 3 hour church training , and Mt . < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > Fest ! I'll be toast by then !!! LOL 
I don't want to freak anyone out .. but .. I AM EXPECTING !!!! I know , I know , it's crazy isn't it ? I can't believe it myself . I wasn't going to put it on here because I wanted to make it official . I mean who would have guessed that I am expecting . Yup it's official .. We are expecting Spring to be right around the corner ! ** Re-post if you have any sense of humor .!! ** 
Off to do more studying !!

An old man once said ... There comes a time in life , when you walk away from all the drama and people who create it . You surround yourself with people who make you laugh , forget the bad , and focus on the good . So love the people who treat you right , pray for the ones who don't . Life is too short to be anything but happy . Falling down is a part of life , getting back up is living ~ Re-post if you agree 
Former raspberry gone grape ! 
Ho-hummmmmm .... missed the gym yet again .... the sacrifices I make to < PROPFEMALE > with pals !!!

Catching the last of this wonderful day with a late afternoon walk ! Must put my mind right to start a super intense week ... then SPRING BREAK !!!!!!!

It's been said that everlasting friends can go long periods of time without speaking busy ... and never question the friendship . These types of friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been . They understand that life is but you will ALWAYS love them . Re-post if you have at least 1 of these friends 
WHY is Easter Sunday so late this year ?? 
Every moment of every day we need to count our blessings and appreciate all that we are given . As we can see by today's tragedy ... NOTHING on this earth is guaranteed ... time , health , youth , money ... everything can be erased in a moment . 
DO NOT open < PROPFEMALE > GARDEN LINK !!! It is phishing to everyone's account !! 
OMG !!!! I am getting excited !! Wish spring break was twice as long already !! Backyard projects ... trip to see boy ... and hook up with my very good girl pal that I haven't seen in ages !!!!! 2 day count down !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Off to bed ... that's right .... less than 12 hours !!!!!!!!!! 
Okay .... I need that official vacation from my vacation ( which was WAY TOO SHORT for my liking) !!! Hope everyone had a GREAT time on your breaks ! can't wait to get caught up !! 
The one u just called fat ? She has been starving herself & she has lost over 30lbs . The one u just called stupid ? She has a learning disability & studies over 4hrs a night . The one you just called ugly ? She spends hours putting makeup on hoping people will like her . The one you just tripped ? She is abused enough at home . There's a lot more to people than you think . Put this as your status if your against bullying . 
Please take a moment to go to Red Cross website and donate whatever you can to the Japan Relief . It only takes a few minutes and even if it is 5.00 it will go towards a much bigger amount that can only help ! Please PRAY for peace of mind and faith because when all the physical things are gone , that is where we find out true strength . If you pray for these people then back it up with action . 
Lights out !!!!! Candles glowing ! Home alone .... ahhhhhh ... 
Great day !!! Love to see the kids ! 
44 days ! Can that be right ??? 
Just got home from the beach !!! What a beautiful weekend !!!!!!! Can it stay JUST LIKE THIS ????
