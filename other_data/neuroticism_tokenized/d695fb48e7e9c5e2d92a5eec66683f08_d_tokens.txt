i dislike catch phrase ... it used to be so fun ... now , not so much . wish we would just play cranium already ... =/ 
i wish Kayne was home .. not that i'd be with him right now ... cause i'm at WORK til 5 ... but still . i miss him big time =[ 
ugh ! i`m SICK ! I hate this !!! 
this kid is driving me NUTS ... playing a game on the computer , and yells or screams everytime ANYTHING happens , good or bad ... and he's like 9 but keeps biting his sister .... out of control . 
off to ... home .. where i have to help do dishes .... hmph . not so excited hahaha 
have you ever had like 10 completely different songs stuck in your head , and you just sing them continuously one after another while you`re cleaning the kitchen ... cause that`s happening to me right now ... haha

sitting at work , and all the sudden BAM !! freakin migraine . going home early ... UGH ... 
okay ... so fudge didn`t turn out so well ... not terrible . but the puppy chow is a different story . it turned out great ! 
Criminal Minds ... how i`ve missed you so ...! i can`t believe i`ve missed almost every episode in the new season ... 
my house is haunted ... i just know it . =( ahhh ... 
i cannot sleep . work it going to be hard tomorrow ... especially if this headache is still hangin out in my head . 
i`ve about had enough with this crap . 
mannn ... i`m craving a tattoo right about now . i wish i had the money to finish my side piece this month . 
\smart ass\ " is so fun ! i feel so intelligent when i play ! =) " 
one thing i dislike more than anything else : being interrupted or people making faces at me while i`m speaking to them ... on that same topic , when people mock me i want to punch them in the face . 
now tell me ... where was my fault , in loving you with my whole heart ? 
mom and Kents party was quite the PARTAY . loved playing games with Topher , Hase , and Mcwrath . 
my friends and family are the very best . thank you all for the birthday wishes =) i love you all so much . 
my freakin car battery is DED . stupid . 
i want a puppy ! 
we`re getting our puppy tomorrow ! he`s a pug-zu 
we`re going to get the puppy ! yay ! 
\average people are the most special people in the world .. and that`s why god made so many of them\ " - < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > - The Office " 
hmmm , i'm not a big fan of \rap\ " but i don't think people understand that it does take talent . most of the \ " mainsttream\ " rap is worthless . but there are artists out there who devote their heart and soul to making music worth listening to . some of my worst days were brightened up by the words and emotion in a rap song . " 
i'm ... so ready to go home ! and have a loooong weekend ! although i'm sure i won't get much rest with a small puppy in our room at night , and a party on Saturday . but still . not having to worry about work should be nice . =] 
dontcha just hate when a guy completely blows the one shot he had with a girl he totally didn`t deserve and then blames it on the world . haha . p.s. this is not about Kayne . =) 
been playin kinect all day =) ... beat some butt at dance central . also got beat pretty bad at some songs . ha 
kayne just can`t help but wipe the floor with me at everything we compete at . 
do you know what warms my heart ? laying on the couch , watching tv ... i look down and see hiccups furry little face staring back at me =) 
kayne is upset with me because i karate chopped him unexpectadly ... i just couldn`t help myself ... ooops . 
WOW . feels like a weight has been lifted ... 
tried a relationship-building/self esteem building excercise with Kayne ... epic fail . 
alright ... so , not only do i have a snoring boyfriend , but i have gained a snoring puppy as well ... hahaha . i can`t help but find my bad luck hysterical . 
i`m so flippin bored . blah . i just want to play a game ! =( but nobody wants to .... hmph . 
one more hour to go . can't wait to get home , take some Aleve , and do something other than think !! =] 
today was great . such a positive reception from the round table meeting today ! awesome . i feel like we`re getting somewhere with the suicide prevention cause ! 
hmmm ... a dog bakery business would be so cute ! I am getting more and more excited about the idea , the more research i do ... 
workin 5 to 9 tonight . i`d love to spend that time writing down entry`s for the < PROPMALE > show tomorrow . there will be live Music , food , good company , and hopefully original < PROPMALE > ! make an appearance to support the local young < PROPMALE > ists ! =)

how much longer is this going to go on this way .... probably until i force a change . but i`ve been hoping for someone to notice the stress piling up and help me out ... obviously not going to happen without an ultimatum . ugh 
what the heck ?... it is almost 7:30 . Kayne and Hiccup are sleeping ... and i`m left awake with no food and nothin to do ... shweet . =) 
hmmmm .... 5 days off , including today ... what the heck am i gonna do ?.. 
well , i`m only looking in through the window but it seems to me .... ignorance really IS bliss ... 
oh my .... \whose line is it anyway\ " is pretty much ... fan-freaking-tastic . " 
call me stupid , but i have reccently discovered that i love Chicago ... the musical . i hope to one day see it in person ! 
what the hell ... this world is ridiculous sometimes . how is this even happening right now ...! 
obviously i`m here ... obviously you`re here too . there`s a reason for all of our exsistance so ... you ask why i do what i do ... and i ask , why wouldn`t i ? if my efforts can save one person ... wouldn`t that be enough to have reason in this world ...? 
Friends of mine who cook , I need some recipes for yummy yet inexpensive meals ... any ideas ? 
uggh ... how to cope ... how to cope ... something is missing from my life , i just can`t figure out what or who . 
i`m a HORRIBLE person ! i just stepped on Hiccup , and he`s limping now . =( 
baked cookies .. they suck . bahaha . lets try some brownies ! got the basement cleaned today ! woohoo ! =)

Long dayyy ..... ready to go home , sleep , start all over in the AM ... but , hopefully this headache will have passed , so it's not such a difficult day tomorrow . =]

uhhh , Bright Eyes on Letterman was ..... AWE-suhm ..... can't wait for the new album !! =) 
okay .... homemade clam chowder was slightly a success .... kayne doesn't like that it's a \soup\ " ... buut .. garrett and his friend like it =) " 
Hiccup has ear mites ... and man are they gross looking ! 
uhmmm . Kayne and i are ridiculous ! if you could have seen us rearranging our house tonight , you would all be hurting from laughing your asses off . =) 
SoOoOoOOOooo ready to go home !!!! haha , i am grateful for the extra hours though ... =] 
uhhh .... so either i just saw UFO or i'm seriously insane ... hmmm .... i'd like to go with the insane option ... freaked out . 
hmmm ... pot roast went well , < PROPFIRST > Sheen has lost it . annd , hiccup is really mastering the < PROPMALE > of stealing socks . haha 
maaaaannn .... the cat is out of the bag , so to say . i SUCK at secrets and surprises . =( awh man .... 
our house is looking better and better as the days go on =) .... too bad we didn`t take before and after pictures ... you`d all be impressed . 
a couple hours of sleep and another day or cleaning , moving , painting and listening to my dog lap up water .... ehh 
life is sometimes unpredictable . and in lots of ways unfair ... i wonder what is in store for me ... 
head is KILLING me .... hmm , not looking forward to leaving work and heading home just to work on the house ... =/

Let's see how creative my Facebook friends are ...... Leave me a 1-word comment that best describes me using the FOURTH letter of YOUR LAST name .... It can only be 1 word ...... Then copy and paste this to your wall so I can leave a word about you ...... Don't just post a word & not copy ....... That's no fun

More snow ... this basically is not okay with me ... hmph 
Hiccup is chilling with us in bed , and as hiccup is biting Kayne's face Kayne says , \awww you cuddle nice ... \ " then hiccup chooses to lay on the floor instead of in bed . So I guess we've been right kenneling him all this time . " 
The house we've been renting is going into foreclosure in the next few months so ... If anyone has any connections or even suggestions for apartments/places to rent , for us and our little pup lemme know . =] and keep us in your thoughts/prayers ! 
working at a library is great and all , but it's times like these that i get frustrated with the job .... an entire book on medieval bakers ? really kid , really ? i don't even believe that book is in existance !! i've spent the last 45 minutes searching and searching ... UGH !

I feel soooooooo awful ! Stuffy nose , head aches , sweating but freezing ! Sore throat , and now this tummy stuff begins ... I can't like it ... being sick is not an option for me right now . 
Still not feeling great ... but going to work anyway . My tummy isn't as upset , let's see how long I last .

We need to begin packing .... not looking forward to it ! 
my first FULL-TIME week just ended ! =] 
Okay , on the hunt for boxes .... if anyone has any , or works somehwere that they have them lying around , lemme know !!! =] 
The first sign of growing up ; even on days I don't work til afternoon I still wake up as if i'm working the morning shift ... dangit ! I was hoping for a sleep-in morning !! 
Don't count on people ... they let you down ... don't trust people ... they turn on you in an instant ... even though I know these facts of life , I still give people the benefit of the doubt and end up disappointed . 
Okay .... slam was fun ! Have a day off tomorrow ... although I know my day off will be spent \working\ " on the house .... " 
I wanna go RED again .... or orange . Opinions ? 
Kayne has been sleeping since 5 .... this whole packing thing is not going well 
Oh gosh .... I want to start an improv group ..... who would be down ?? 
Been a looooooooong day , up since 6 , packed til noon , worked til five , dinner , then boiling , dying , and hiding eggs til 1:30 ... now to sleep for a few hours and then be cheerful for Easter !! =D 
Why do I find giving raspberries SOOOO hilariously entertaining ?! It seriously makes me laugh uncontrollably . 
Dear < PROPFIRST > , you are worth more than a gold plated Lamborghini to me . I will not continue to help keep you sick . Please stay safe and take my words to heart . I love you .... sincerely , me 
I just spent two hours playing barbies ( that's right ) barbies ! With Kaynes 7 yr old neice ..... because ..... I'M AWESOME !! And she is awesome too . I love spending time with her one on one . These next few days are gonna rock =) 
Let's see who truly reads my status . You and I wake up in a psychiatric < PROPMALE > together . Using FOUR words only , what would you say to me ? NOTE : If you comment , you must copy and paste this to your status so I can comment on yours as well . ( 4 words is harder than you think ) 
blaaahh ....... I feel sooooo awful . light headed , body aches , upset tummy .... all over ickyness .... working all day too . and then instead of going home to relax , i'm gonna go home and pack because we are moving on SATURDAY , and all we've packed up is our DVD collection .... AHHHHHH 
Here I am .... a day before moving .... trying to get kayne to help me pack .... and still no cooperation . Can you say ..... STRESSSSSS ? 
Who knew some people could be in such strong denial ..... such a sad world we Live in some days . 
Feeling very defeated . I am going to keep praying , and hoping for the best outcome ... but the way things are going , i'm more or less just preparing my heart for his death . 
We officially moved our first box into our new apartment ! Is anyone else excited for our new adventure ?! 
I hate to say I told you so ..... so , I'll just say , you were wrong ... I was right . 
' I cannot go to school today , ' \

To all my FB friends : in honor of Mother's Day I'm trying to see how many of you are willing to change your profile picture to a picture of your mother and keep it there till May 9 . I did , and so have several others . If you will and like this idea , please repost this as your status so everyone gets the word and let's see how many beautiful mothers we can get on FB ! 
Blahhh ! I am so frustrated with people . Do you realize that you don't know everything about EVERYTHING ? Or do you just live in a world so out there that you truly believe you are the go-to-guy for every single piece of info ?...
