Most people have 1000 wishes for Christmas ; a cancer patient only has one , \ 
to get better . I know 97% of you won't repost this to your status , but\ 
my friends will be the 3% that do . In honor of someone who has died , or\ 
is still fighting , or survived cancer , copy this to your status even if its just a short while . < PROPFEMALE > Chr ... istmas ! 
God saw u getting tired and a cure was not to be . So he put his arms around u & whispered come with me . With tearful eyes , we watched and saw u pass away . Although we love u dearly , we could not make u stay . A < PROPFEMALE > heart stopped beating , hard working hands at rest .. God broke our hearts to prove to us , He , only takes the BEST . Put this on your status if there is someone in heaven u will miss this CHRISTMAS . 
\Holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else ; you are the one who gets burned . \ " - Buddha "

Dance to music even if it is only in your head . 
Worry wastes wisdom 
in religion and politics , people's beliefs and convictions are in almost every case gotten at second hand , and without examination , from authorities who have not themselves examined the questions at issue , but have taken them at second hand from other non-examiners , whose opinions about them were not worth a brass farthing . \
