Ten weeks left until I'm a graduated Esthetician ! Finally Got a job in the mean time ! Excited . On a definite Emotional Rollercoaster , Not sure how things are going to work but maybe soon something will change . I hate lairs with a passion and I'm tired of being lied to my face , I always find out when I've been lied to and it pisses me off . So please dont . Theres my once a month blurb on facebook lol ! 
Fixin to delete my facebook in the next day or so . Peace out Peoples ! 
Its been awhile . But I'm back . Cleaned out my friends lists and what not ... In love with an Amazing guy and couldnt be happier ! 
I just want to scream . As loud as I can for as long as I can . And then quit life . Cant I quit for just one day ? No one will let me though . I dont understand the way this world works , and I dont like it . So for today I'm going to pretend to quit life . The tomorrow I'll pick up where I left off today and be better ...

I finally feel okay . Still in some pain and in need of somewhere to live but I feel good . I'm optimistic about where life is headed , of course being who I am I'll never not be worried about all the little details but for now I'm doing alright . I'm in love with an amazing man , I have the most amazing bestfriends(I love you guys ) and two great jobs . It feels so good to be in such a good mood again !

Children with special needs don't have an illness , so there is no cure and it's not contagious . They want what we all want , to be accepted . Most of you probably won't copy and paste this . Could you do it and leave it on yourstatus for at least 1 hour ? It's Special Education week and this is in honor of all the kids who need a little extra help and understanding . So will you make a difference ? 
Well . I like working at Walmart . Its interesting . My feet and lower back are killin me from all the stand but it good ... I need a new plan or maybe just something new . Something doesn't feel quite right ... Hmmm . I'll figure it out ... Smile ! :D

Hmmm . Facebook . Its been awhile . Now that I can use my computer maybe I'll be here more often . but for now Goodnite FB ! 
Well . My New Year Resolution was to make me happy and maybe not worry to much about how others felt by my actions and I royally fudge it up . Leave it to me tho . Althought maybe it was for the best . I've made some realizations and I hope that things will begin to change from here on out . I started last night and strive to continue in that path ! 
... Ahhhhh . I want to scream at the top of my lungs until I pass out . It might do me some good . Lol . 
20 years . I've been alive for 20 yrs in just a couple of days . So Crazy . Lol .

I'm so incredibly emtionally exhausted ... Goodness ... I wish this was easier ... 
... I'm hoping that things are starting change for the better . I'm hoping to start being my happy self again . I know new years is when your supposed to make your changes but now is good as any . Just because your alive doesn't mean your living ! \ 
I Love You . Thank You for being there ! 
I hate oroville . With a burning passion . Ughh .

Going to chico with My Love . Hope we have a good time . 
Just got my hair cut . Feels good ! I feel better now . Talk to me ... 
Having dinner with My Love ! Happy Vday ! 
You irritate me . Beyond belief . Im not sure why , I really shouldn't care anymore but the way you've been acting has been affecting me , and I dont like it ... 
My head kills . Ugh . I feel super shitty . Ready to leave Oroville behind and just explore the world . At least I'll have a week away from this shithole . Yay . I miss you Grandpa . Maybe I'll get to see my bestie while I'm down there ? I miss you Neaa . 
Definitely unsure about what I need to do . I wish there was a simple way to fix all this . I mean my mind and health tell me one thing but my heart aches for another . It seems so simple but its just one simple decision that can change my entire life ... Ugh . I dislike my life very much right now ... 
If you have a Best Friend who has made you laugh ... Stuck up for you ... Drove you crazy ... Got mad at you ... Watched you succeed ... Saw you fall ... Picked you back up ... Cheered you on ... Had your back ... ready to fight the person who ticked you off or made you mad ... and all these things made your friendship stronger and you can't do without their friendship . Paste this to your status and see if they know who they are :) 
Excited to see my grandfather next week . Its been forever since I've seen him ... 
At the doctors . Maybe they can tell me whats wrong . Then off to see a friend . Can't wait to see my grandfather next week .

Okay day . I miss some people I used to be close with . I feel kinda loney ... He's always there , I love you < PROPMALE > ! Movie time ! 
I wish I didn't feel like everyone I was close with and care about are slipping away . I was talking to an old friend , and I realized that the friends that mean the most to me are slowly slipping away ... Ugh . I hate this ... Plus I miss my brothers intensely . I Love you < PROPMALE > ...

If your heart is a pocket looking for change , \ 
My heart makes sense . <3 
Going up the tram . Up to the snow ... Taking tons of pictures today !

On our way to the airport . I'll be on my way home soon ... Gonna miss my gpa , and this weather . 
Boarding the plan momentarily . Its been a long eventful week . Cant . wait to be in his arms ! 
Home . Finally home . :) I was so excited to see him ! But I lost my necklace . :( I love you ! 
Its been one year . <3 Wow . Seems not that long at times but sometimes longer than that . I love you ! 
Had a good day . Got to see Girlie and Baby B . Love those two . Get to see an old friend tomorrow ! Time to head home . :) 
You know , I'm not sure why I try so hard . I have always wanted to please and I always see its toll on me but I keep trying anyway . I have these relationships that are based on their wanting my friendship only when times are bad for them , and I hate it . Yet I continue on and let them . I guess I just don't want to be alone , but alone is usually how I feel ... At least He's here for me good or bad . I Love You Kenny <3 
Its nice catching up on old times . I wish life was easier sometimes ... Oh well . Eh . Goodness . 
Not feeling well at all . Not health sick , just overall blah ... I kinda miss highschool . At least the friend aspect of it ... 
All I want is Passionate , Unrestricted , Undying Love and Understanding . Is that so wrong of me ? Too much to ask for ? No , nothing is wrong . I just watched Love and Other Drugs(Great Movie ) , and it made me think a lot . I never could answer the \what do you want\ " question truthfully . But that's it . Plain and Simple . " 
I wish that I could not care about certain people anymore . I wish I could wipe my slate of friends clean and start over with new people . Okay not all of my friends but nearly all of them . I want to quit being so caring and start taking care of myself and my relationship ... I guess I'm just tired of feeling like I'm losing people I care about the most , and is ready to just cut the ties and be done ... 
I need some people to realize that I wont be around forever . I'm the type of person who is going to be there for almost anyone regardless of how I feel about them or whats going on in their life . That's just who I am . I never turn away from someone in need . But I'm tiring of feeling alone , and used ... I'm about to turn my back . Something I've never been able to do ... But I just can't take to much more ... 
Sitting here watchin < PROPFEMALE > get her hair did . Ahhhh . Kinda hungry . Someone text me ! 
I love my man . Sooo much ... I love you ! 
I hate vehicles and tax people . Our car is breaking down , I need $99 to be able to get my extra $1000 of tax money ... Ahhhh . Grr . Im not happy now . 
I hope that one day someone will do you like you do everyone else and you'll know how it feels . It may not phase you but at least you'll know ... On another note this weather sux . I want sun ! so I can go swimming ! I miss swimming ....
