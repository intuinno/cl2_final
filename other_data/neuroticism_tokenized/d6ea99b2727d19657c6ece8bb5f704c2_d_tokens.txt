Know anyone in the greater Sacramento area ? Please hook me up ... going there soon ! 

rediscovering my favorite music ! Hell yes to drowning out the obnoxious neighbor . 
Looking for dog-friendly month-to-month rental in Sacramento , Rancho Cordova , or Folsom , pronto ... 
Can you help us move some boxes & furniture into storage prior to or during the 4th of July weekend ? If so , please contact me or < PROPFEMALE > . Ideally we need a pretty big posse all at once . Much thanks ! 
homesick and emotionally exhausted . 
According to weathermap , SB was 72 degrees today , Sac was 102 . * whine * 
Concert in the Park was lotsa fun tonight . Am getting past the weather and realizing Sac has many charms . 
How can I have a cold when it's 105 degrees ? Didn't anyone explain the word \cold\ " to the bug ? Maybe I'm just allergic to something ... " 
Stoked to be seeing < PROPFIRST > and crew in < PROPMALE > tomorrow ! 
Boot camp is kicking my ass . 
If you like Persian food -- or any food at all -- and you're in the Rancho Cordova area , try Sharzhad ... I had my tastiest meal in forever there last night . 
really , really , really contemplating getting a Pre about now . 
should have been asleep 4 hours ago 
BUILT TO SPILL , Saturday August 22 @ < PROPFEMALE > Jones in < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > . Who's going ? Lemme know . Tickets @ Clubmercy.com ... 
It's true : Salinas is the salad bowl of the world . Watch for falling croutons . 
mi familia es loco . 
O to the Y .

Work weekend in Bako . No offense to the Bakersfield residents among my friends , but it smells here like 700 metric tons of cattle poo mixed with a catastrophic oil spill . 
Gaah ! Why do I always get sick at the worst possible times ! 
Need help transferring files on a < PROPMALE > . I'm in the Salinas/Hollister area . It's urgent . Ideas ? Thank you . 
Disk drive situation settled . Thanks for the suggestions , all !

Respect . 
Did you hear about the butcher ? He backed into the meat grinder and got a little behind in his work . 
I wondered why the baseball kept getting bigger . Then it hit me . 
Did you see the dog giving birth by the side of the road ? A cop cited her for littering . 
I love the rain , but seriously now ... FOR WEEKS WITHOUT STOPPING ? 
Finally felt well enough to walk dog . Promptly twisted my ankle/foot so badly that I should probably be at urgent care . Ouch x100 . 
It's official : I broke my foot . 
would like friends and family to stay healthy , please . 
Anyone got spare tickets for ROLLER DERBY tomorrow 2/27 in Ukiah ? 
SAD LACK OF ROLLER DERBY . 
Trepidation . 
From the ecstatic reports of folks at my office who did NOT miss the roller derby , there was no half-pipe around the track , so every time someone ate it , they took down part of the crowd with them . Still not forgiving myself for missing it . 
is spending Saturday night doing laundry . Wild and crazy . 
A rubber band pistol was confiscated in algebra class because it was a weapon of math disruption . 
In one week : health care reform passed , student loans improved , key appointments made , underwater homeowners sent a lifeline , arms control agreement reached with Russia , Afghan surge ramped up ... all despite total obstruction from the opposition . About damn time Obama had a good meal at the Taking No More Shit Bar & Grill . 
The world of Facebook friending is vaguely disturbing . Someone adds you , and you have to confirm them to see a photo of who it is , upon which you realize you don't know them at all , and ( feeling inexplicably guilty ) you delete them . Strangers-as-friends and \deleting\ " people ... it's like an episode of Dr Who . " 
The only thing better than Peeps is stale Peeps . ( fellow lovers of extra-chewy marshmallows , back me up here ) . Scored the last pack from the half-price Easter clearance aisle . It's the little things ... 
Titanium Spork . That is all . 
could get used to not being poor . 
It has been brought to my attention that I \wouldn't f*ing last a minute in New Jersey . \ " I take this as a compliment . " 
Are there any beaches in the greater Eureka area where lots of friendly dogs roam and play ? My dog needs to meet some buddies . 
Apologies if anyone got spammed by that stupid quiz virus thing . Don't allow it access to your stuff ... if you accidentally allowed it by pressing the wrong button ( like me and the person who passed it to me ) , then go to Account , Application Settings , Delete to get rid of it . AAARGH . 
Attn friends : I may be couch-surfing the first 3 weeks of June . Am gratefully accepting ( dog-friendly ) sofa appointments now . Thank you . 
< PROPFIRST > Guerrero's \A Little Bit o ' Somethin'\ " is still my all time fave late night chill album . If you're still up -- it's late night . Go download it . " 
Anyone interested in going in on a cool rental house in SB ? Or have one with an opening ? 
tired of being tired . 
If every day had today's weather , Humboldt County would be a paradise . 
I lost my phone . :-( 
Anyone read < PROPFEMALE > Silverman's book yet ? Ciaccio ? Anyone ? Worth it ? 
In SB today , presently farting around @ Jitters . 
Bought used VW Passat w/under 50k mi . Repaired so far : three oil leaks , one coolant leak , 6 spark plugs . Next up : another coolant leak , two ignition coils , and 6 plug wires . Unsurprisingly , the dealer doesn't seem interested in honoring the warranty . 
Suffering the allergy attack from hell : after untold Claritins , 3 Benadryls & a cortisone shot , I'm still miserable ... 
needs to do more sleeping , so he can do less screwing up . 
does not understand why anyone would stay home to watch the South African National Vuvuzela Symphony Orchestra ( aka World Cup ) on TV when the *** SUMMER SOLSTICE PARADE *** is happening downtown . Best people-watching in universe . 
Who wants to offer up a truck and some muscles this weekend ? Time to move the contents of the storage unit into the garage , so I can stop paying to store my junk offsite . 
My sister and her 3 kids will be visiting SB from July 24th to 30th , and I need a place to park them . Anyone know of a house needing house-sitting during that time , or ...? 
The Deveros are really good and I feel privileged that they practice in my garage . 
OMG , high school reunion . 
http://nyti.ms/cnIivd 
Class reunion did not suck . Money well spent . Up with people and so on ! 
Advice to NorCal friends : Do not do business of any kind with Berkeley Honda . They ripped me off and failed to respond to the DMV Investigations or the Better Business Bureau -- from whom they have an F rating . Looks like I may have to < PROPFEMALE > . 
Lovin ' the new BBQ . Noticed that if you put the food on a little grill ( such as a wire rack ) and put that on top of the main BBQ grill , it's much easier to remove the food . This is what we call hot grill on grill action .
