Time to quit the quizzes and get some sleep 
I just spent two days and nights with baby < PROPMALE > . He is so sweet , adorable , he has a very pretty face and I can't wait to spoil him rotten . < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > are going to make excellent parents . I am very blessed to have four beautiful grandsons . 
I got back home about 4 hrs ago . I already miss < PROPMALE > - he is a beautiful little boy - he definitely is not a fussy baby and love to hold and rock him . They are very lucky parents and he is lucky to have them - they are really great with him . It was also good to get home to the other 3 grandsons - I miss them while I was gone 
Just spent 2 great days with < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > . Had a fun time holding and spoiling < PROPMALE > - he really a sweet baby and not a bit fussy . Now I am back with my other 3 grandson and they also are very sweet 
Just watched Kansas BB - very close call tonight - but still think they are the best !!! 
Just got back from watching the Nebraska Volleyball team kick butt !! Go Huskers 
Well officially retired as of Friday , Dec 18 , 2009 . Excited to start a new phase of my life . Been a very up and down year . I do want to thank my wonderful children ( Di & < PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > & < PROPFIRST > ) for the wonderful SURPRISE party last night . It was wonderful - I am so blessed and lucky to have such thoughtful and loving kids . Thanks again kids !!! 
Got back today from Washington D.C. Had a great time with my sister - we always seem to have lots of laugh - as we do many crazy things . I hope to get back there sometime - to see many of things did not have time for this trip !! Thanks < PROPFEMALE > for taking us with you - as always you are fun to be with . 
Cloudy , rainy days make me very lazy . Just sitting around watching everything - I have on DVR !! Love it . 
Always amazes me that on a rainy day and streets can be a little sliclk people still drive as if the streets are dry - someone nice person rear ended me today and used the slick streets as an excuse - forget the speed !! Just thought I would vent . More damage to hiis vehicle than mine though . 
has the most wonderful daughter in the world !!! ( hahaha . take that < PROPMALE >!) 
sorry < PROPMALE > . Di has mov < PROPMALE > to # 1 . 
Tomorrow will be 1 year since < PROPFIRST>'s death - we are all very sad and spending the day together . Thanks Di and < PROPFIRST > , < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > for making this past year bearable - could not have made it without you all . < PROPFIRST > you are always in our thoughts - Love you and miss you . 
Heading out to < PROPMALE > to have lunch at the Oven with some dear old friends . Have not seen them for years - very excited to see them . 
Thinking about a short nap - going to Memorial Park this evening - need my rest to fight the crowd - but looking forward to some great music . 
I just ate a burger and fries from Five Guys in < PROPMALE > was great !! 
Went to Des Moines for 3 days with sister and brother-in-law - we camped in their fifth wheel - now that is camping - had a great time !!!
