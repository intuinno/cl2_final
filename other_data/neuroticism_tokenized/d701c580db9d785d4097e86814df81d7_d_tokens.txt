My body is tired and falling apart at the seams 
And I know its not to get away from me , you just need a change of scenery . So strange how everything went wrong so fast and I hope that this confusion does not last . 
My wish for you is that this life becomes all that you want it to . Your dreams stay big , your worries stay small , you never need to < PROPFEMALE > more than you can hold . And while you're out there gettin ' where you're gettin ' to , I hope you know somebody loves you . And wants the same things too . Yeah , this is my wish .

Now I know why all the trees change in the fall . I know you were on my side even when I was wrong . And I love you for giving me your eyes . Staying back and watching me shine . 
there's nothing like a nice hot shower to calm you down 
I need better music to listen for when I'm pissed off . Coheed and Cambria will suffice for now . Any suggestions ? 
So give me all your poison . And give me all your pills . And give me all your hopeless hearts and make me ill . You're running after something that you'll never kill . If this is what you want then fire at will .

If u have a wonderful man that works hardto take care of you , would do anything for you , that makes you laugh , that's your best friend , who you want to grow old with , who is yourworld & someone that you're thankful for every night , then postthis as your status to give the good men out there the recognition they deserve , because great men are few & far between

Bored and looking for a project to do ... maybe work on revising my link costume ...? Is it too early to be thinking about Halloween ?

62 degrees in August makes me very unhappy 
Why do I always have such scary dreams ? I wish I didn't dream so vividly . 
My ocarina came in the mail !!!

< PROPFEMALE > Bowler and I have political conversations in the shower nbd 
Currently in a poke war with 6 people FUUUUUUUUUU 
Why do I always have the weirdest dreams ? 
The poke war has gone up to 7 . I refuse to back down .

Finals are the bane of my existence 
Christian Andersen is graduating today and I couldn't be more proud of him ! Congrats babe ! <3 
What's up with all the banana peels outside of Thatcher today ? I had no idea we were playing < PROPFIRST > Kart 
Anyone in Thatcher willing to kill a spider for me ? I'm extremely afraid . 
Stupid ComDis . I don't want to take your final . 
All done with finals ! Heading back home :) 
Why is comcast so awful ? 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas !! :D 
<3 CA 
Feels colder inside than outside . I can barely feel my hands . 
Fell asleep at 10:00 hoping to get a lot of sleep before my 6:20 flight to go see Christian Andersen ! Apparently my body thought I was just taking a long nap > < Only a few more hours !!! :) 
Flight cancelled :( not looking forward to this fiasco 
Waited in line for almost 3 hours and was finally put on standby for the 3:20 flight . Im stuck in < PROPFIRST > for the next 7 hours . Yay ! -.- 
Snow in South Carolina ... what the hell is up with that ? 
Christian Andersen got me a kitten mouse pad ! SUCCESS ! 
Had a great vacation with Christian Andersen <3 Back to UMass tomorrow 
I got a roommate who plays WoW . Success . 
I can't stand those people in a class that feel the need to demonstrate their knowledge to everyone by bringing the lecture to an irrelevant topic and continuing to argue their point for way too long . I don't pay for these classes just to hear people flaunt their useless garbage . Let the professor teach ! Sheesh ! 
Trying to figure out why I thought it was a good idea to take two french classes fml 
It's definitely nap time . 
I hate snow . Why do I still live in < PROPFEMALE > ?! Gimme Spring plz 
I am officially a linguistics < PROPMALE > :) 
I thought jalapeno cornbread would be disgusting but it's actually really effing delicious 
<3 paychecks 
And none for < PROPFEMALE > Weiners bye 
I feel like I'm finally getting hit by the plague of sickness . NOOOO !!! 
gleeeeeeeeeeeeeee <3 
I'm so excited to see Christian Andersen tomorrow !!! :) 
Nearly pooping my pants watching Christian Andersen play Dead Space 2 
Heading back to umass . Its way too cold . Give me spring please ! 
2 1/2 hour long queue to get onto a rift server fml 
My work is complete ! I can finally relax :) 
Coughing so much ... I feel like my chest is going to explode ! :( 
I really wish the Bank of < PROPFEMALE > site wasn't down right noooow uuuugh ! 
What do I do when I'm sick ? Lay in bed all day watching the wild thornberrys on youtube lololol 
Celibacy club singing Afternoon Delight lolololololol 
Theres a difference between expressing how you feel and being an instigator 
Off to see Christian Andersen ! See you soon babe ! :D 
Today , I ate bayrische rinsouladen mit spaeztle . It was amazing . < PROPMALE > restaurants <3 
Christian Andersen is coming to visit tomorrow <3 Super excited :) 
Nap tiiiiime 
Watching Mulan :) 
I love losing something that someone told me not to lose . 
Sooo the book that my professor let me borrow and told me to not lose is still MIA . Just bought another copy on Amazon in hopes that it looks exactly the same . 
So much back pain . Neeeeeeeeeed Motrin ! 
I really wish I could play minecraft but my laptop sucks :( 
\You're a ruthless bitch . But I love that you're a bitch . \ " -Christian Andersen "

Back at UMass ... already looking forward to going home for Easter . 
Time to go into homework completion overdrive . Mozart Go Go Go ! 
Beaucoup d'anxiété ... Je veux l'été!
