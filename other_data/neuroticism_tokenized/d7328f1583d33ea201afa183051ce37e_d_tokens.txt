WGR550's droid app is the sweetest app I've ever seen 
Wow , another great win for St. Johns . 
Awesome weekend so far !!!! 
NBC is a joke . Instead of giving me the Sabres game , they give me the Detroit-Minnesota game . If you weren't gonna give me the Sabres game , U could've at least given me the Flyers-Rangers game .

Gotta love the NBA 
< PROPMALE > Boyes is now a Buffalo Sabres ! 
Does tornado warning mean no class ? 
The real thing that stuck out to me from this morning wasn't the tornado warning but instead , the severe thunder storm taking place . That shit was intense ! 
It smells like the warm rainy golf course smell outside and I'm loving it 
NHL trade deadline day has been BORING so far 
WWE RAW is in Buffalo tonight ! 
Big game for Ohio tonight . Go Bobcats ! 
Great win tonight Bobcats ! 
Crazy game going on right now in Miami . < PROPMALE > 24 point comeback . Up 5 with 7 minutes left . 
Fox and Turner interested in picking up NHL television rights for next year . ESPN also in the mix . Hockey is about to become relevant again . 
Muck Fiami 
Stupid people don't deserve to be allowed to express their opinions . 
Can't believe I have to stay in on a Saturday night for this stupid Communication Law research paper . This sucks ! 
I might be writing the worst paper of my life right now

Cmon OU , Stop playing like shit 
OU basketball comes through with the choke job 
When times get rough , root for Syracuse ! 
I hate french homework thats due on a Friday night at 11:59 pm 
Penn State just beat Wisconsin 36-33 . How do you win a game scoring only 36 points ? 
< PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > is the best announcer in sports ! 
RIP < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > . Famed member of the Sabres French Connection . You are a legend in Buffalo and you will not be forgotten . 
So excited for the NCAA tournament ! 
Syracuse is gonna kick Indiana State's ass ! 
This pains me to say , I have Ohio State winning the National Championship 
Ohio University basketball season isn't over yet . They're going to the CIT . 
The 30 for 30 Fab5 documentary on espn tonight was absolutely amazing to watch . Just a great documentary . 
I might be going to the NCAA tournament on Friday in < PROPMALE > !!!!! So EXCITED !!!!! Not for sure ....... yet but have a friend buying tickets . Also , who is playing Friday night in < PROPMALE > ? That'd be Mah-Quette and the CUSE !!!! 
The First CIT Championship game 2 years ago was Butler vs . Old Dominion . Both won games in the NCAA last year and have made it back to NCAA this year . Could Ohio University follow in their footsteps ? 
Going to < PROPFIRST > tomorrow to cover Ohio University in the CIT . 
Snooki is going to Wrestlemania !!!! 
I know it's just the CIT but Ohio's win over < PROPFIRST > was an awesome game tonight . Game was tight throughout with OU's defense winning it for them in the end . Now on to the second round . 
< PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > is announcing the VCU-USC game . I am now officially pumped for the game ! 
Forget studying for final exams , the NCAA tournament is here 
Got my first loss of the day . No big deal . Had Old Dominion losing in the next round anyways . 
First upset of the tourney ! Morehead State over Louisville !!!!! 
Wow , what a sad ending for Penn State . Fernandez wins game for < PROPFEMALE > with . 4 seconds remaining . 
Morehead State to take on Richmond in second round which means that at least on 12 or 13 is going to reach the Sweet 16 
I love the NCAA and all but its sad to think that last year at this time , OU pulled the biggest upset of the tournament by beating Georgetown as a 14 seed while this year we are only competing in the CIT . 
The tourney was going great today until St. < PROPFIRST>'s decided not to show up 
I'm going to the NCAA tournament tonight in < PROPMALE > !!!!! Gonna see my Cuse play for first time ! 
Finally Home ! 
Going to NCAA tournament was so sick yesterday . Sat 6 rows up near mid-court for Syracuse game 
Scoop Jardine is an idiot ! Cuse deserved to lose . They played like shit 
100,000 people attended Buffalo's St. < PROPFIRST>'s Day Parade today . That's a lot of people . 
2nd time bowling in 3 months , averaged 223 . Yea , I still have game . 
Home on Spring Break and it snows .... 
Big day tomorrow : Internship Interview , Fish Fry , Sabres Game , Hanging Out . Most of important of them all , The Fish Fry ! 
Hahaha Ohio State 
Had the best Spring Break ever . I love Buffalo and had an awesome time being back home . 
I just found out that I got an internship in the sports department of channel 7 WKBW-TV in Buffalo !!!! 
Let's-Go-Buffalo! Beat those damn Leafs ! 
After hearing < PROPMALE > Dilfer talk about Cam < PROPMALE > , I'm back to wanting the Bills to draft either < PROPMALE > or Fairley 
I don't think the Sabres are going to win tonight 
What a win for the Sabres !!!!!!!! 
Since I have no favorite teams in baseball , I'm going to adopt the Reds as the team I'm going to watch this year . 
Reds Win !!! 3-run walk-off home run by < PROPMALE > Hernandez !!! 
Just found a very cool website on Buffalo sports . I'm gonna try to contact the owner of the site and try to become a writer for them . Hope my plan works out . 
The Buffalo Chicken Finger Wraps at < PROPMALE > Garb n ' Go are great ! 
Buffalo WINSSSSSSS in Overtime ! 3 point lead with 3 games remaining . Playoffs , HERE WE COME ! 
I'm watching the women's final four . It doesn't get anymore exciting than this .
