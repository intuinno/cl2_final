When I come home at nightI bolt the door real tight People call me on the phone I'm trying to avoid But can the people on TV see me Or am I just paranoid When I'm in the shower I'm afraid to wash my hair ' Cause I might open my eyes And find someone standing there People say I'm crazy Just a little touched But maybe showers remind me Of Psycho too much That's why 
I'm just an average man With an average life I work from nine to five Hey , hell , I pay the price All I want is to be left alone In my average home But why do I always feel Like I'm in the twilight zone

Nintendo 3DS coming March 27th , 2011 ! 
It's okay to feel good about yourself , especially if you look like me . 
Kids with special needs aren't sick or gross . They only want what everyone wants-to be : accepted . Can I make a request ? Is anyone willing to post this and leave it on your status for at least one hour ? It is Special Education Week , and this is in honor of all children made in a unique way . You never understand a situation ... until you are faced with it . 
so i can officially say that Being Human totally rocks . no joke . 
Can you dig it ? SUCKAAAAAA !!!!!!!! 
if it wasn't for the Renaissance Awards , we would be closed tomorrow . stupid smart people ... 
Choco Taco ... Breakfast of champions . 
this is bull . i hate snow . i woke up late for set construction , had to walk in this crap just to find out it was cancelled . snow sucks ... PERIOD . i would like it to die ... 
i swear , i get chills at the end of The Dark Knight every time i watch it ... 
it's too early for me to be up on my day off ... 
Just got back from South Broadway Athletic Club to see my boy Ace Hawkins wrestle two matches . A triple threat , and one for the MMWA-SICW Jr. Heavyweight Championship . Great job man ! But you got robbed in the title match . lol 
cleaning my room ... it's crazy what a beautiful day can do to some people . 
SO freaking happy right now . nothing can bring me off this high . FINALLY , < PROPMALE > The Rock < PROPMALE > is BACK and taking over Wrestlemania XXVII !!!!! =] 
i wanna be so < PROPMALE > that i can hire somebody to walk in a room before me w/ a boom box and blast a theme song for every entrance i make . 
1-7 play practice today . ugh , i really don't wanna be there for 6 MOTHER F@%&ING HOURS !!!!! shoot me ... 
2nd night for the play . last night was pretty good . lets hope we can top it ... 
last show was a hit . kinda bummed that it's over . :/ but next year will be just as good ... 
Lost MC ... 
i hate having to sit back and watch all this happen when i can't do anything about it ... breaks my heart . 
We live for He's worth , and that's more than you'll know . He died for He loved , and what He loved was you ... 
got back form the gym . never been to one before . tonight was my 1st night ... and i threw up . thank you White Castle . :) 
i wonder how many status ' have there been w/ the words snow , sleet , really , etc . my guess .... too many . 
Raw tonight ! Should be fun . I sure hope I don't catch herpes VIA airborne toxins from being in the same room as Snooki though ..... 
Monday Night Raw was awesome tonight . i love the Road to Wrestlemania ... Especially when they make a pit stop in St. < PROPFIRST > .... 
im bored ... i think ill play Vice City ... :) 
Happy St. < PROPFEMALE>'s Day ! Time to skip most of my classes to march in the Dogtown parade !!! 
I can't believe my school . I used to like it . Mainly b/c of some certain teachers .... but this is ridiculous . How in the blue hell are you have a million dollar baseball field , and then fire teachers b/c of budgets cuts ..... and tell certain teachers that they need to keep what's important . This is pisses me off soooo much . I can't stand it . 
St. < PROPFIRST>'s High School students ... we NEED to rally against this atrocity of a school . we NEED them to right this wrong . we need them to fix this injustice . we NEED THEM TO KEEP MR . CURRAN ! 
im so bored , im gunna burn down a field full of marijuana .... 
sooooo bored . it's way too early to go to bed .... 
i cant help but to feel like it's too early to go to bed .... 
You either die a hero , or live long enough to see yourself become the villain ... 
' People tell me that my personality is divided . I don't think so , but maybe it is . ' 
J-E-N-O-V-A 
not gunna lie , mulching sucks when your not getting paid .... 
Is there a mute button for Bop-It ? 
I am the man of the hour , the man with power , the man too sweet to be sour !
