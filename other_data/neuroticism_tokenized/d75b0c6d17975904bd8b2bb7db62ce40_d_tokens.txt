How did I survive the last year without internet ? I'll tell you how-I learned how to GO TO BED AT NIGHT !!! 

Busy day of birthday partying ahead-Happy 10th to < PROPFIRST > !! Full day of swimming and cake eating and video games ! 
* sigh * End of a 4 day weekend . Kids now officially have music on their MP3 players , and I don't think they have ever been so quiet ! Music really can tame the savage beast ... 
My thought of the day-If you always do what you always did , you'll always get what you always got ! 
So I got about 18 inches cut off my hair today-feels like my head's gonna flop forward all the time without all that weight pulling it back ! 
Finally decided it was time to upgrade my phone . Why didn't any of you people tell me how cool the built in MP3 players were ??? 
Finally found a nice set of bunk beds for the kids with matching desk . I don't know what was more difficult-hauling all those parts to the 2nd floor , or putting the stinking thing back together !! Yet another reason I will NEVER move again ! 
Thanks for all the birthday wishes !! Was definitely a great one-won a free dinner at the White Buffalo Grille , then won $300 at the craps table at Fitzgeralds-only regret was not taking the night off work !
