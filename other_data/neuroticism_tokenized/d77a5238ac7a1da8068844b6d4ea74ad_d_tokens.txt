Sticks and stones may break my bones ... But whips and chains excite me . 

I got your thank-you card today . It was very nice . 
salutes < PROPFEMALE > Crane , who separates the women from the girls . 
might very well write her college essay about < PROPFEMALE>'s . 
My face is working just fine , but anathesia makes me puke . A lot . Thanks for your prayers and especially to < PROPFEMALE > Crane and Tayla for one very giant < PROPMALE > bear :) 
Spending tonight in the hospital . Again . FML . 
I am going to kill myself . I can't believe I'm still in this frigging hospital . It's impossible to sleep in a hospital . 
PRAISE DA LAWD I'M HOME AT LAST . 
Post the name of your favorite song and add \In My Ass\ " to the end of it . " 
Was just outside when the expression \shoveling shit against the tide\ " came to mind . How appropriate . " 
Just gave a great interview for a full scholarship at < PROPMALE > College . Say a prayer that I get it ! 
' s computer just got a virus . Remember that sad song the band played while the Titanic was sinking ? I'm hearing it as I move all my documents to my flash drive . 
Will somebody in bioethics please post one of the prompts for the scripture reflections ? My sheet is MIA .
