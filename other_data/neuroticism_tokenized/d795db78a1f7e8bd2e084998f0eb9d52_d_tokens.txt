I'm at a crossroads but still following happiness . 

( q_p ) ( v_v ) (-_-) (•_•) (^_^) (*?*) 
With a mind like space , free to behold all things without clinging to them ; like the earth , any experience can tread through w/o it clinging ; like the sky , it breaths meaning into everything ; like water , it can be muddied yet retain its essential nature w/o clinging to impurities ; like fire gone out , diffused into the air , alighting only when the causes and conditions are ripe for its excitement . This is freedom . 
It's never as it seems . Only as it is . 
It's all open to me . I can walk in any direction . 
In Oklahoma for another week . Leaving the householders life to go to the Buu Mon Buddhist < PROPFEMALE > in Port < PROPFIRST > , TX . I plan on leaving Firday . Hit me up if you want to < PROPFEMALE > out before I go . 
I wont leave until all the goodbyes have been said . Today is too soon . I will leave later . I have no reason to rush anywhere . 
Mu < PROPFEMALE > no < PROPFEMALE > - Mind of no mind 
Packed and ready to go . Making my way to Dao Quang in < PROPMALE > , TX in the morning then to Buu Mon in Port < PROPFIRST > , TX . 
The bus leaves Thursday . 
Going to meet the Sangha today , when they come for the dhamma talk , chanting , and meditation . 
I am thankful to myself for following my heart . I am thankful to the world for supporting the path to the fruition of my desires . I am thankful to you for being all that you are . I am thankful for this moment . I am thankful for the phenomenon of existence itself . I am thankful . 
I would like to build the first completely American Buddhist < PROPFEMALE > in the heart center of the country , < PROPFIRST > , OK .

Give yourself some love . \ 
Give love to all the thoughts as they arise , and pass . \ 
Give love and wishes of joy to all those people you may think of . \ 
\ 
Sit with love . \ 
May you be well . \ 
May you be happy . \ 
May you be peaceful . \ 
May you be successful ( at attaining the three above ^^^)\
