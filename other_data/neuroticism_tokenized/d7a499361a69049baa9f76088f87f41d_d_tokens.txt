I love FML . The site makes me very happy I don't ever do anything . =] 

Watcha gonna do , whatcha gonna do when ? comes for you ! Red scare , Red scare ! 
Lots of famous people dying lately . 
EVERYONE IS DYING !!! o.O 
Can't wait to watch < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE>'s < PROPFEMALE > In Wonderland . It looks freakin ' awesome . I really doubt it can top < PROPFIRST > and the Chocolate Factory though . 
Mahatma Gandhi , as you know , walked barefoot most of the time , which produced an impressive set of calluses on his feet . He also ate very little , which made him rather frail and with his odd diet , he suffered from bad breath . This made him .... A super 
Dragonball : Evolution is actually really good . Though , they could have made the characters more distinguishable . 
Happy Birthday President Obama ! =] 
Let me know if anyone needs anything from the Rum Drinks Collection . I've only got one Rum Runner . The rest I have multiples of . Though , I've already vaulted , so all of them are up for grabs . =] 
Lord Zurkov & < PROPFIRST > Goentzel .... RAWR ! I'm a dinosaur . 
I saw an article on CNN that said \House to consider resolution criticizing < PROPMALE > on Tuesday\ " I thought to myself House and < PROPMALE > ! Awesome ! Then I discovered they meant the House of Reps and < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . =[ " 
Ahoy , me hearties ! 
That was one of the best episodes of House I've ever seen and I've almost seen them all . The writers are amazing . I loved how they played with your emotions . That's the sign of a good show/movie/book . ^_^ 
Today in U.S. Government we travelled to Hoven's class . Professor Seel wanted to let him know that his is bigger . This is why I love college . ^_^ 
Happy birthday Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi ! ^_^ 
I typed \Rawr ! I'm\ " into google and my results included : \ " Rawr ! I'm a taco\ " and \ " Rawr ! I'm a sparkly vampire fear my glitter\ " . This is a wonderful use of my weekend . ^_^ " 
Public service announcement : House M.D. is on now ! 
I love politics . ^_^ 
will everyone please copy and paste this into their status one time ?, thanks ! : NATE BUNN AND SPECIAL GUEST < PROPFIRST > EMERT APPEARING FOR AN ALL HALLOWS ' WEEKEND OF MUSICAL ENTERTAINMENT- JOHN'S KITCHEN & PUB OCT . 30-31 9PM 
? 
Gah . I've got 4 hours to get this 4 < PROPFEMALE > report done -- that still doesn't account for sleep . An even bigger question is why am I on here instead of working on it ! ='[ 
I was just on CNN's site , one of the articles was \New black Barbies get mixed reviews\ " . It goes on to say that critics don't think the dolls are black enough . I wonder if the pun was intentional . " 
Why is everyone against change so much ? I swear whenever Facebook makes one change tons of people get up in arms . I'm not saying people shouldn't complain if they don't like a new feature but instead of insisting on it's removal why not suggest ways to improve it ? 
Am I the only one that thinks Phineas and Ferb is the only show worth watching on the Disney Channel ? Their music is like cocaine for the ears . 
I just told my little sister that Halloween had been cancelled . Then she started crying . ^_^ 
Really enjoyed the Smash Mouth Concert . 
is planning on doing ALL his homework today so he can relax the rest of the weekend . 
Just got a Google Wave invite from Google . Seems pretty neat . ^_^ 
Lord Zurkovand I were discussing a few minutes ago how they had a word for loss of eye sight , hearing , and speech but we couldn't figure out what it was for smell . Apparently , Anosmia is loss of the sense of smell . I thought it was pretty odd that it wasn't commonly known . 
I lead such an exciting life . I just spent the last 30 minutes looking up the evolutionary reasons for vegetables tasting bad for fun . It's actually really interesting . 
Happy Thanksgiving ! 
Watching House and drinking my first legal alcoholic drink . =] 
Thanks everyone for wishing me a happy birthday . I had a great evening . =] 
RIP < PROPFEMALE > Murphy ='[ 
Party time . ^_^ 
Happy New Year ! 
Damn . We're no longer a democracy/republic thanks to the supreme court . Now we're a Corporatocracy . This country is fucked . 
The state of the union speech was amazing . There was so much common sense . 
I really like the new layout ; I particularly enjoy the placement of the friend request , message , and notification buttons . I wonder how many people are going to bitch about the changes . >_< 
Open Mic night was a blast . 
February 4th is the International Day for the Fight Against Cancer ... In memory of those who lost the battle against cancer , and those who continue fighting . I pray for a cure . 92% of you won't copy & paste this text to their Facebook profile status , will you ? I DID , for those I love . Proud to be part of the 8% . All of you who love < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > do this . 
I just finished watching < PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland . It fought gender roles , and societal expectations . It showed \mental illnesses\ " in a possitive light . It showed the philosophical divide between fate and free will . It was humorous and had great graphics . It had an epic fight seen as well as showing decapitated heads . I'm really not sure how it could have been any better to be honest . " 
Can't wait to watch House M.D. tonight ! It's been like three weeks since a new episode has come out . 
Happy pi day ! 
Today is a good day to be an American . 
Open mic night always makes my brain feel all tingly . I love it . 
I love writing speeches but I can't stand giving them ! They're so darn energy consuming . Speaking of which Kansas Green Energy Summit starts Thursday ! Huzzah ! 
Ahhh . The weekend is here ! It's time to do loads of school work , everyone's favorite weekend activity . Meh . It's not all bad ; I might even learn something ! ^_^ 
I need to find a way to articulate myself in a way that doesn't offend people , without lying , or maybe society should stop being so sensitive . Hmm . 
Lost weekend : Please contact if found . 
May the 4th be with you . 
Welp . I graduate tomorrow . >_< 
Today was eventful . \ 
\ 
The music at the graduation ceremony was fantastic . The speeches were great too . I'm definitely going to miss ICC and more importantly the wonderful professors who work there . \ 
On a completely unrelated note , I found out I'm going to get thousands of dollars worth of testing done at St. < PROPFIRST > this summer . The best part is I get paid $600 for doing it . ^_^ 
I luvz me some Open Mic . ^_^ 
On my fifth or sixth day of going cold turkey from caffeine and my head is only hurting worse . * sigh * 
It's really embarrassing finding out that you're human . >_> 
Gasoline tastes really , really bad . >_< 
The Red Cross irritates me . What exactly is the harm in allowing video games to use the Emblem ? -.- 
>_> 
The new Devo album is freakin ' awesome ! ^_^ 
So much time and so little to do . Wait a minute . Strike that . Reverse it . 
Two hours at the gym = pain . =\\ 
Yay for gun rights ! ^_^ 
19.5 hours to Memphis via bus tomorrow morning -- Not too excited . =[ 
Gah . I finally have internet here at St. < PROPFIRST > . I have so much stuff to check . * Sadface * 
Heading back home tomorrow . Huzzah ! 
It's good to be home . ^_^ 
Goodbye interwebz . I shall see you Friday . ='[ 
I officially have a room at PSU now . o.O 
Heading for PSU tomorrow . O_o 
My dorm room looks really nice with the lights out . 
I miss being able to cook . * Sadface * 
I just defended the Republican position in a class discussion and everyone else disagreed with me . >_> 
I just saw some girl wearing a cape ; is that the latest fad ? If so , count me in ! ^_^ 
I probably shouldn't be so thrilled by the two second conversation I had today but it's the first I've had with a physical person ( other than myself ) in two weeks . >_> 
I just watched Clockwork Orange -- very fine movie . 
Hell is just one big laundry room . >_> 
House ! 
Happy National Punctuation Day !

I really wish I had taken American literature at ICC instead of here . Blah . 
\Spose a man was to come to you and say ' Polly-voo-franzy'- what would you think ? \ " \ " I wouldn't think nuff'n; I'd take en bust him over de head\ " - Adventures of Huckleberry Finn " 
You have to love < PROPMALE > galleries ; where else could you find penises , < PROPMALE > , crops , and children's toys all in one place ? 
Has been without his computer for nearly five hours . I am still alive believe it or not . 
I'm really beginning to hate fire alarms . 
I\m looking forward to watching < PROPMALE > Burnham tonight . =] " 
I almost wish that I didn't have the rest of the week off . There's nothing interesting to do in Pittsburg from what I've seen and the more time I spend in the dorms , the more my contempt for humanity grows . 
The most inspiring thing I've seen was a homeless man eating garbage . He didn't ask for money and was ridiculously careful the way he opened and closed the bags . Thankfully , the police promptly removed the \threat\ " before I got back to him . " 
Does anyone know whether the Museum of Crawford County is worth walking five < PROPMALE > to visit ? I'm thinking of going either this week or next week . If I don't find something entertaining/intellectually stimulating to do I think I'm going to explode . 
Special needs kids aren't sick or gross . They only want what we all want : to be accepted . Can I make a request : is anyone willing to post this and leave it on your status for at least an hour ? It is Special Education Week , and this is in honor of all children made in a unique way . All children are a blessing 
I just got back from the Jungle Book play . It was pretty good , especially the set design and costumes . The acting was great . A few the actors seemed nervous in the beginning ( who wouldn't though ? ) . My only complaint is that the ending was a bit abrupt and the there was still a bit of unresolved tension between Mogli and the cocky villager . \ 
My favorite part : a man behind me shouted \Nom Nom Nom\ " with perfect timing " 
Best part of Neewollah : A float for the Optimist Club with nobody on it . I couldn't stop laughing . 
\Rules are just guidelines for stupid people who can't make up their own mind . \ " - House " 
I just got back from listening to this crazy religious guy . If only everyday could be so entertaining . 
* sigh * There's nothing quite as fun as doing school work on the weekend . 
I just went to see the penultimate < PROPMALE > Potter film ; It was quite good . 
I have come to the conclusion that Black Friday is a better tradition than Christmas . They both have the same objective in reality but only Christmas pretends to be about something else . 
* Sigh * I'm going to be up all night trying to finish this dang assignment . It wouldn't be so bad if the teacher wasn't such a harsh grader . =[ 
Thanks everyone who wished me a happy birthday . =] 
I just got back from the student directed plays ; they were really good . I particularly enjoyed the Ledge , Ledger , and the Legend . ^_^ 
I tried playing World of Warcraft all day today -- Am I cool yet ? 
If it's this cold tomorrow I'm not eating . I can't wait till spring . * sadface * 
I just noticed something mildly irritating . Facebook has a place on their profile for sports related items , TV Shows , movies , and books but nothing for games ! I wonder why not considering their popularity . 
I was already very excited about Tron : Legacy but now I'm even more excited ; I found out Daft Punk is doing the music for the film ! \ 
In other news , I was playing Beat Hazard with the song She Blinded Me with Science . I thought it was a bit funny . =] 
It is so nice to be able to cook again . ^_^ 
Yay ! I just checked my grades and they're better than expected . 
My < PROPMALE > class really helped me today ! ^_^ 
Bard's Tale is a freaking amazing game . 
So , I just watched Tron : Legacy ; It was a very enthralling film . The music made it spectacular . \ 
I've heard tons of people suggest the film had a weak storyline . I'm wondering if the people who have reviewed the film so far were intelligent enough to understand it and the bigger meaning behind it . \ 
Plus , any film that references War and Peace nonchalantly is good in my book ! 
Holy crap ! When did they add a \games\ " tab to people's profile ? I just suggested that on the 13th . I love coincidences . " 
I just found out I can donate blood ! I had previously been told that anyone with a history of Leukemia was not allowed to donate . Apparently , if you had it as a child and it's been over ten years then you are allowed ! It's only those who had it as an adult that aren't allowed . \ 
* Dances * 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmahannukwanzadan everyone ! 
Well , I'm back in Pittsburg . ^_^ 
Has learned quite a bit today . \ 
1 . Philosophy teachers like to reference < PROPFEMALE > Claus in their lectures . \ 
2 . There is a correlation between professors that include comments about gaming in their lecture and their teaching style . It just so happens to be my favorite teaching style . \ 
3 . Taking six classes in one day is not a very smart idea . 
I just walked 1.8 < PROPMALE > to my first class only to find out that it had been cancelled for the day . * Sigh * 
Today is not Opposite Day . 
Man , sometimes I feel sorry for the people I debate . I think I owe most of the credit to < PROPMALE > Seel from when I was in his Philosophy class . The whole getting your opponent to agree to your definition is an amazing strategy . 
I just got back from watching a presentation by < PROPMALE > Huh ( the \I Can Has Cheezburger ? / Fail Blog\ " guy ) . He was pretty entertaining . ^_^ " 
I'm getting a single room next semester ! < PROPMALE > Hall 302 ftw . 
I spent the day at the Kansas Philosophical Society meeting . It was a blast . I never realized how many philosophers were gamers either . I haven't felt this energized since when I used to go to Open Mic . \ 
The only downside is knowing this will probably be the last intellectual stimulation I get for a very , very long time . 
The power went out . Sadface 
I've been on the computer more than usual this weekend and now I'm getting sick ; it must be one of those darn internet viruses ! =P 
Damn you , Murphy !
