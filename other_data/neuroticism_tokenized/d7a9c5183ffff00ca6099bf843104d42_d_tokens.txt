Thanks everyone , for your thoughts and caring about smoky . 
Please\ 
put this on your status if you know someone or are related to someone \ 
who suffers from stupidity . People need to understand that stupidity is \ 
real and should be taken seriously . You could be sitting next to a \ 
sufferer right now . There is still no known cure for stupidity , and . . \ 
.... sympathy does not help , but ... we can raise awareness . 93% won't \ 
copy and paste this , because they don't know how to . 
GO BSU !!
