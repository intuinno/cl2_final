I was raised to be courteous , kind , compasionate and caring , honest and respectful , strong at heart and tender at the same time , help those in need if it means going out of your way and put others first cause the blessings you will recieve come from all the above and if you are blessed as a result of what you do then you will be a blessing to those you touch .
