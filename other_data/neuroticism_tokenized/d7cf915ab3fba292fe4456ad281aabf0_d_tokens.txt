Still here I < PROPFEMALE > my old delicious burdens , \ 
I < PROPFEMALE > them , men and women , I < PROPFEMALE > them with me wherever I go , \ 
I swear it is impossible for me to get rid of them , \ 
I am fill'd with them , and I will fill them in return . 

the family is drawing near i can feel the judgment coming 
who thought hdmi was was so complicated 1.0 1.3 1.3 a-b-c with ethernet and lets not forget led compatible and what about the up and coming ultra hd can't do without that 
so i quit my job today and im pretty happy about it 
so i'm stealing this idea but whatever \comment your favorite music quotes \"" 
you know for a long time now i've said that being depressed is a choice i guess i just never thought i'd have a good reason to feel like this againl i wonder how long i've been living and not noticing all these things i've been doing wrong there are reasons people ignore me i feel like i don't deserve the attention anyway i'm just a blip nothing to be remembered or at least i hope so 
feeling a little better now that i'm home it's odd but i always feel better when i'm in the woods and some time alone to think is helpful too by the way thank you 
can you see those eyes in the mirror \ 
the judgment you forced upon us\ 
forever binding escape with art\ 
a poetry so sweet we parish 
with logic and devotion torn at the seems\ 
i hold this memory firmly give it back to my dreams\ 
there's no hope in these places no time to waste\ 
what am i looking for that's just not in its place 
Lo , there do I see the line\ 
Of my people back to the beginning .. \ 
Thay do bid me to take my place among them .. \ 
In the Halls of Valhalla , \ 
Where the Brave may live forever . 
In War ... Victory , In Peace ... Vigilance , In Death ... Sacrifice 
There’s something wrong with people today \ 
\ 
They’ll take your money but not your advice \ 
How are we suppose to raise children in this world\ 
So detached from nature unaware we live together 
Happy Birthday Grandma \ 
I love you and I hope you found\ 
peace 
now i know why they call it the dirty dirty 
i can't trust you to understand \ 
these things would hold a man\ 
force him to admit the truth\ 
there's nothing i can say to you 
i'm almost done setting up the laptop 
finally home after 3 weeks in the hot hot heat of south Texas
