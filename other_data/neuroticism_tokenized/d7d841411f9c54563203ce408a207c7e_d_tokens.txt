... you cannot abuse the rungs of the ladder by which you go up . 
For me , being in business isn't about competing . It's about finishing what I start , starting when I'm finished , and being better than I use to be - not trying to be better than anyone else . 
Some things never change , and some things do . 
Success isn't just about what's on the outside . It's about filling ourselves up with so much love and recognizing the beauty we have inside - without needing to rely on externals to tell us how beautiful and loving we are . Success is really about spreading our beauty , our love and the essence of who we are - our greatness - into the world like a neverending wind . That - is true success . 
With a changing current - comes a new direction . 
What are your new years solutions ??? Not resolutions ... solutions ?

Those who are certain of the outcome can afford to wait - and wait , without anxiety . Change is inevitable ... Progress is not . Make progress in the direction of your dreams . Turn your dreams into manifestations . Turn your manifestations into realities .

Light to the son of the Dalai Lama and their family . 
To look in the hearts of people is really God's business . None of us can really say we know what is in the heart of another being . However , when we look at words and watch actions , the words and the actions can tell us more about the heart of the individual . If the words are magnificent and the actions are not congruent with the words , the action tells us more about the heart than the beautiful words that one speaks .
