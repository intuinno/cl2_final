If we listened to our intellect , we'd never have a love affair . We'd never have a friendship . We'd never go into business , because we'd be cynical . Well , that's nonsense . You've got to jump off cliffs all the time and build your wings on the way down . < PROPFIRST > Bradbury

Dear Jesus , Am I doing something wrong ? I ask you everyday to end my pain when I sleep at night . I ask for friendship and love from that special person . I read scripture daily , and I spend time with you daily . Why are my prayers still unanswered ? I do not blame you , for I know you have no time clock or years . I just hope you answer me soon <3 Amen 
Gets to go to church tomorrow night yay :D
