Whoo , Happy New Years . 

Saw Avatar last night . Friggin AWESOME movie ! Loved it a lot . :] Very , very original style and everything . Going home this morning . Tired ... Only five hours of sleep . But I've managed school on less , so this'll be a piece of cake . :] 
Leavin for the beach on Wednesday ~ 
Starting at some point and time tomorrow , more likely afternoon , I will be off to the beach ~ Meaning no one can really contact me till Sunday ... Unless my phone has service . Which I really , really doubt . 
I AM BACK FROM THE BEACH ! Oh , so very happy ... Now , as much as I love the beach , I realllly hate those rides to and from , man . 
Woooooow . So . The rest of the summer seems to be decided . I start the Driving part of Driver's < PROPMALE > on Monday ... Whoot ~ Finally on my way to gettin a permit . I should be able to get one on my Birthday ~ ! I hope I can get one on my Birthday . I can't wait till 
Hahahaha ... Boredom strikes again .. I have created TWINS . I have always wanted to draw twins ... It's hard , but it's < PROPFEMALE > fun . Now I just need names ... Any helpers ? 
GOD I am so bored ... 
Something evil's watching you , comin from the sky above , there's nothing you can do .. Prepare to strike , there'll be no place to run , When you're caught within the grip of the evil Megatron ~ Transformers , More than meets the eyes . Transformers , robots in 
Strong enough to break the bravest heart , We have to pull together , We can't stay worlds apart ... Stand divided we will surely fall , Until our darkest hour , When the light will save us all ~ ! 
Can't wait til Friday !! 
Tomorrow is my birthday ~ 
Thanks everyone who wished me Happy Birthday and Good luck ! :] 
Sigh .... 
WOOHOO ~ ! I just got my Permit ~ I can drive nao . I drove on the way home . Mother is still scared of me driving . Muahaha ~ ! ^___^ * is a happee kid * 
Sitting here ... Watching my snake eat ... A very interesting thing to watch . o_O .. Waiting for my Aunt < PROPFIRST > to come and pretty much take us away .. Lol . Got some Transformers Songs on my MP3 , so I'm good to go ! 
WHOOT ~ Got back from San < PROPFIRST > yesterday ! It was SO COOL ! On the way home , we got to see bats ! > w < Yes , bats . They were coming out from underneath a bridge , there were SO many of them ! I got a lot of pictures .. It was so fun . We went on a Ghost Tour and Ripley's Haunted Adventure , went to the Alamo , walked beside the river , and this one animal farm that was AWESOME . Lemurs are so cute ! 
I think I've had enough swimming to last me a week . v__v 
Home from Texas now .. The Puppies are very happy . ;D BB is hopefully eating his little mouse thing . =3 Momma is thrilled . XD And I can't wait to sleep in my own bed ! 
Ah , The Watchmen ... I love Rorschach . Wish Dr. Manhatten had worn at LEAST underwear(lol ) , and hated that Rorschach died ... otherwise , it was an awesome movie . =D 
Still don't understand why school starts on a Tuesday , but I guess it's whatever floats the school board's boat . Watching Corpse Bride . ^_^ Waiting .. Bored . 
Uggggggh . First block tomorrow is ROTC .. Then Theatre Arts ... Civics ... And Geometry . D: I dun wanna end the day with maaaath .... 
I don't get how I'm a nerd for liking Transformers , but the person who accuses me of being said nerd for liking said movie is obsessed with < PROPFEMALE > Trek . Hm ... 
School .. * groan * Why so soon ! 
Ah . Okay , I definitely like three of my classes , the fourth .. yet to be determined . Math is never fun for me .... But the good news is that I may not have to < PROPFEMALE > a book at all !! 
Hahaha . Played the Lead Game in ROTC today . Funnn . Did a few push ups , but not much , so I reckon I did good for remembering half the stuff I did ! Haha . Hopefully our class will have much fun teachin the Freshies . >=3 
< PROPFEMALE > .. deep breaths . Gonna gather what little courage I have when it comes to guys tomorrow , see where it takes me . After all .. Can't live life without a little risk .. right ? 
OOPS , Sorry < PROPFIRST > ! I was distracted by something else ! 
DUUUUDE ! I just changed my Facebook language to Pirate !! XD I LOVE IT ! 
99 bottles of rum on the wall , 99 bottles of rum .. You take one down , you pass it around , 98 bottles of rum on the wall .. XDDDD 
.__. I'm watching a YouTube video when all of a sudden my computer makes Transformers transforming noises . I now believe my laptop is trying to tell me something . 
MLIA 
Going to get my hair cut todaaaay ~ I hope it looks good ~ 
WHOOT ! I got my hair cut , I love how it looks now . Not as long , nice and light .. Haha . And then we walked from the hair place to Dairy < PROPFEMALE > , and I ran into someone there ! I'd say today was pretty dern successful . 
Well ... At least I can look forward to Saturday now . 
98 bottles o ' rum on the wall , 98 bottles o ' rum .. You take one down , ya pass it aroun ' , 97 bottles o ' rum on the wall ... 
Today , I was thinking about the phrase \Revenge is a dish best served cold\ " . Then I thought about \ " Revenge is sweet\ " . I've come to the conclusion that revenge is ice cream . " 
Munching on Shockers .. I love them . I still want a milkshake . >.< 
Well .. I'm pretty sure I failed the Cadet Challenge . v__v 
Hurm . I wanna do something tonight ... 
Well , today was fun ~ ! 
Re-organized my dresser today . Hm . The nick-nacks look better now . Have ' em all nice and put in places . Knife looks good , < PROPFEMALE > knife looks good . Hand-made , not-so-good sculpture looks decent . Now to figure out how to put my swords on display ... 
Don't WANNA wake up early tomorrow !! D: Watching Let's Play Silent Hill ... I do NOT understand why male protagonists in video games , when made into movies , are replaced with females . I say keep the males . >:[ 
Wanna get some quotes . I is so very not wanting to know how I did on the Civics test today ... Cleaning my room ... Blegh . My room NEVER remains clean , even if I just sit on my bed and do NOTHING , SOMEHOW , my room will find a why to make itself dirty . 
I am the future of < PROPFEMALE > . Be afraid . Be very afraid . 
Eets Nom-nom-licious . 
May no soldier go unloved , may no soldier walk alone , may no soldier be forgotten Until they come home . 
Watching < PROPFEMALE > Red . Wanting to play American Mcgee's < PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland - I wonder where I could find it . Marching in the Mule Day Parade tomorrow ... I'm sure I'll be burning in my class A !! 
Hurm . 
Math is a legal form of torture invented by people who hate joy . 
Does it not worry people that ' slaughter ' is just ' laughter ' with an ' S ' added to the beginning ? 
Okay .. I've apparently sent too much Flair and Hearts today . Hahaha . 
Girls , I HATE to burst your bubble .. But if it SPARKLES , it's GAY . 
is feeling really ill . :[ 
is FINALLY importing the 561 pictures in her semi-new camera . 
Head is KILLING me .. Hurt like heck all during Geometry . Luckily , we had a sub today , so got to do next to nothing ... Merely because she doesn't like Math so she let us ' teach ourselves ' .. Haha .. Got my work done , though . Blegh .. 
Making different Creature designs right now .. Macabre/Horror . Though I don't think I'm doing good at the ' horror ' or ' macabre ' part . Right now , they just look .. Well , yeah . I think I've made TWO good ones .. We'll see .. 
Watching Let's Play Silent Hill ~ Going to draw Pyramid Head ! 
Smoly hokes .. Going to draw for a bit . The one person that ever really talks to me is grounded , so yeah . 
Zoo tomorrow . :] Can't wait , specially with my camera , I will take lots of pictures ~ Especially of all those WONDERFUL REPTILES !! XDD 
* sigh * So much I want to say , and yet if I do , I fear I will offend too many people . So my mouth will remain shut , but my mind will continue to think of what I want , when I want it to . There is nothing anyone can do about that , I'm afraid . 
I feel like going on an enigmatic status spree . 
I understand the concept of cooking and cleaning . Just not as it applies to me . 
Finally got the songs I wanted on my MP3 after about an hour of trying to figure out what was up . >.> But I got the songs , so I am very happy . :] 
Say a prayer for peace .. For every fallen son .. Set my spirit free . Let me lay down my gun .. Sweet mother < PROPFIRST > I'm so tired , But I can't come home ' til the last shot's fired .. - Til The Last Shot's Fired 
... My Mother won't answer her cell . 
Current ' Project'(Character ) - Kiyo , age 25 . I'm at a loss of ideas for a background for him ( bio ) , so if anyone has any ideas do let me know ... 
It's more powerful than God . It's more evil than the devil . The poor have it . The < PROPMALE > need it . If you eat it , you'll die . What am I ? 
I so wanna see the movie 2012 .. 
I'm gonna be Rorschach for Halloween . :D 
YAAAY !!!! I will OFFICIALLY be Rorschach for Halloweeeeen ~ 
Loooong day today ... v___v ... Can't wait till the weekend is here ! 
Listen to each drop of rain , whispering secrets in vain .. Frantically searching for someone to hear their story before they hit ground .. 
Had LOTS of fun at the State Fair today ! :D Had some ... Deep Fried Cookie Dough ... As good as it was , I don't think it settled well with me ... But it was good ! And I have a nummy Reeses Caramel Apple for later ! :D 
So tomorrow , Drill is going to be performing at the State Fair for Military Appreciation day . We're not too bad .. And besides , it will be fun . :] Here's to hoping we will do good ! 
Drawing and trying to think up ideas . :\\ Making up a world is rather hard . 
Watching Transformers 2 !!!!!!! :D I love it . ^__^ 
Goin to the Fair again tomorrow for the third time ! Woohoo ! I love that place ! XD But I wanna have someone to go with me . :[ 
Working on math project ... blegh . 
Whoo ~ FINALLY done with my Math Project ! 
I feel ... Like ... crap . I mean just ... crap . I feel hot , my head hurts , throat hurts , I feel like I'm going to throw up at any second ... GOSH why does there have to be a test in Geometry tomorrow ... 
* curls up in a ball and whimpers * 
Come to me children , and follow my way , into the world of Darkness and Magic . With all my powers I'll show you the way , to all your dreams , hopes and illusions ~ Halloween is almost heeere ~ 
Hahahahaaaa .... Needless to say , I have a lot of < PROPFEMALE > . XDDD 
Oh , fun fun ... Designing people , clothes , and hearts . Not easy , but fun enough . Until you get into the rut where no ideas come to you .. 
Well , my good mood went RIGHT OUT the door . I really hate it when people use me as an outlet for their anger !!! 
I can hear about people getting murdered , hurt , and kidnapped and all I can think of is ' Oh , sucks to be them ' . I read about the Fort Hood victims , and the tribute set up for them - 13 pair of Combat boots each with an inverted rifle topped with a helmet - and tears start to fill my eyes . Hm . 
\ ' I'll allow you to live ' or something like that . \ " From Magic Bites by < PROPFEMALE > Andrews " 
Listen to the rain ~ 
Is wondering how the heck < PROPMALE > 10's < PROPFIRST > ended up wearing speedos . You may be several diff elements dude , but you still should be decent . >.< 
I am all alonez and sadz and I want someone to talk toooo . :[ 
I WILL BE COMPLETELY HONEST FOR 24 HOURS ... you can ask me one question ( only in my inbox ) . Any question , no matter how crazy , sinister , or wrong it is . I WILL answer no matter what . You have my FULL honesty , but I DARE you to put this as your status and see what questions you get . 
Pardon the french - Pissed pissed pissed pissed pissed pissed pissed pissed !!!!!! Do not try to start a friggin argument with me about crap when I have a whole bunch of crap I can put against you ! I can almost PROMISE I can win almost any argument you try to start with me ! 
I wonder if I can make any plans for Saturday .... 
Happy Thanksgiving ! 
Mmm .... Stuffed , gonna have some Pecan Pie later ! Yum ! 
Gotta get up at Three to do some shopping ... Though most of my shopping will be done at the Dollar Stores . I hate not ever having enough money to get my good friends something decent ... :[ 
Been up since three , gonna go BACK out shopping in a few ... Gotta finish up with the friend shopping and such ... Found my DS games and a few other things , so very happy . :] 
Woohoo ! Just got back from shopping , very fun day ~ :D Ate some yummy food and got a milkshake . :] Finished most of my Christmas shopping for my friends , too ! 
Can't wait for Christmassss . :] 
I am hungry and there is nothing to eat . :[ 
Wah ! I just found out how nummy a < PROPMALE > Bar is . .___. I likes them . 
* sigh * 
Rawr 
Tired of all the crap that's going on . 
Well , great . On top of everything else happening , I am now worried to tears about my best friend in Minnesota .. 
Muah ! 
Relaxing day today , for the most part . :] Cleaned my room , momma got me a new pair of earrings , I got a popcorn tin , and all in all a good day ! :] 
[ ?? $ ?? ( ?? 1 ?? ) ?? $ ?? ] 
Unusually tired today . Hm . Ah well . Hope tomorrow is a good day . 
I'm getting real tired with all the people I have on my friends list putting up emo little statuses . I mean really , people . 
Very irritated right now .. 
Throat hurts . Hopefully not coming down with anything , that would royally suck . Gonna take something for it soon . 
Snowing in Texas ! :] 
Whoo , it's finally Christmas .. ~ Hope everyone has a good one . 
I don't really know who I am , It's time for me to take a stand , I need a change and I need it fast , I know that any day could be the last 
Had a very , very , very fun day today . Had < PROPFEMALE > spend the night last night , and then went to the Skating Rink with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > and others . It was funnn . 
I want just enough ice for a two hour delay . 
Definite two hour delay tomorrow , which is awesome . :] 
Green . 
It's lonely ... 
I'm much happier now . :] Thanks guys . 
Got a new ring today . It's pretty cool . Green agate . :] Also got two necklace charms as well . A working hourglass and a < PROPFEMALE > circle with a dragon circling the top . I'd say it was well worth it . :] 
Drawing people with wings . XD Feathers are interesting to draw . 
Oh geezus ... people are saying Avatar is racist because the main hero is white and saves the Na'vi! Really , people ? I mean , come on ! It's a movie !! 
Civics EOC tomorrow ... Then Geometry Review ... Then Geometry EOC ... Oof ... I am not ready for this . 
Kinda wanna cry ... 
Ooof ... Done with Civics . Now just gotta survive the Geometry EOC tomorrow ... 
If you don't go after what you want , you'll never have it . If you don't ask , the answer is always No . If you don't step forward , then you will always be in the same place . 
I suppose I passed my Geometry EOC . :] No more Math for the rest of the school year ! Woohoo !

Rain , rain , rain ... I love it when it rains ... :] 
Oof .. I'm practically deaf in my right ear ... It's annoying . >.< 
This is really wierd . My eyes are all like \I can see ! \"" 
Saw Avatar again today . That was an awesome movie . :] 
Since when did trying to be a friend mean that you're ' hogging ' that person and that you ignore everyone else ? I just don't get it ... 
Hmm . I like quotes . Anyone wanna share their favorite quote ? :D 
:[ 
Well , my arm is now in a sling . My right arm . The bone/muscle is badly bruised to the point where I can barely move it . I can't do to PT tomorrow ... 
Hurts to move my arm , even more so than yesterday . Can't pick up anything heavier than , like , a pencil . Doing things with one arm is very annoying/hard . 
... I wish I had someone to talk to .. hum .. 
It is cold out there , but it was kinda fun . I made the best of it with one arm and no one to talk to . :] 
Wish I could enjoy the snow a bit more . Ah well . 
go to urbandictonary.com and type in your name , copy and paste to your status . 
Starving . Should probably get something to eat . Sigh .. 
I dunno . I feel ... sad . :[ 
I don't like < PROPFIRST>'s Day .. v__v .. 
North < PROPFEMALE > has just about reached its Maximum Snow Capacity . I mean really . 
Happy Single's Awareness Day . 
I want to be remembered as the girl who always smiles even when her heart is broken and who could brighten someone else's day even when she couldn't brighten up her own . 
It's kinda cold . Even with a blanket . Hmmm . 
I am worried . Did I do the right thing ...? 
HOOOOME ! I love Friday . I'm making bacon ! :] 
I no longer believe my sister is fourteen . I believe she is five . -__- 
Ahhh , everytime I swallow , the right side of my throat hurts ... 
It is BEAUTIFUL outside todayy ~ Absolutely perfect weather . Too bad I can't go out an enjoy it yet . 
click ' like ' if i have ever made you smile in your life . Set this as your status and see how many people you have made smile ~ ? 
D . C was pretty fun . I enjoyed it . :] 
Whatever tomorrow brings I'll be there with open arms and open eyes . 
I have a horrid headache right now . 
Ouch ... For some reason , it feels like someone just drove a knife into my heart .. 
It finally hit me . As I stared down at the words I had written upon the paper , the truth of it all finally hit me , hard and cold .. He isn't mine , and he will never be mine , no matter how much I wish for it . He is too far out of reach for someone like me . 
IF YOU ARE BRAVE .... Copy this into your status and see what people rate you . 1 : Crazy . 2 : I'd marry you . 3 Talkative . 4 : Sarcastic . 5 : Loveable . 6 Clubhead . 7 : Moody . 8 : Dumb . 9 Spoiled . 10 : Mouthy . 11 : Random . 12 : Hot . 13 : Funny . 14 : Fit . 15 : Amazing . 16 : Beatuiful . 17 : Cute 
Got a hair cut today , it doesn't look half bad ... Shorter than what I'm used to , but hey . It actually looks kinda cute , which is saying something because it's me . 
Ooof . I have a horrid runny nose . >.< It's annoyiiiiing . Putting my hair up for the inspection today was a pain , but it was worth it , we still have our pretty gold < PROPFEMALE > ! :] It wasn't near as bad as I thought it would be . 
Owww . I have an awful headache , my nose is all stuffy , and I don't have enough fingers - or toes - to count how many times I have sneezed today . Geez ... 
It's only Tuesday ... * cry * 
Alone . Yes , that's the key word , the most awful word in the English tongue . Murder doesn't hold a candle to it and hell is only a poor synonym . — < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > 
I feel sad now . :[ 
Ahhh , my stomach hurts . :\\ Not funnn ... 
Watashi wa ... Hitori . Itai yo ... Watashi no kokuro ga . Onegai , dakara ... \Aishiteru\ " tada sore sae ienai mama .. " 
I want Spring Break to hurry up and get here . 
Okay , THAT makes sense . Let's get angry because the cable isn't working and take it out on our spouse . Because that is OBVIOUSLY the most logical thing to do ! 
Not in the best of moods now . And I really doubt I'll be better in the morning . 
No schooool tomorrow . I can sleep in ! But I will have nothing to do tomorrow .. :[ 
Stand in the rain , stand your ground . Stand up when it's all crashing down . You stand through the pain , you won't drown , and one day what's yours can be found You stand in the rain . ~ Tis a good song . 
Mm .. I think I like him .. 
One . More . Day !!! Interesting day today ... Not quite sure I agree with half of First Sergeant's decision , but we'll see how it turns out . Can't wait till Spring Breeeak . :D Wanna < PROPFEMALE > out some time .. Any takers ? 
Nails are green now . Haha . :] 
Back home from fishin . Ahh , today was a great day , the ' easter < PROPFEMALE>' got me a new fishing pole and a cute little green rabbit plushie . :] And , naturally , chocolate ! 
Had funnnn today ! Went to the movies and then dinner with him . I'm surprised at how fun it was , actually . :] 
Yumm . Just got back from Outback . Twas delicious . :] 
World Fair was funnnn . :] I think we did pretty good - I was Canada , haha . Or , as I have accidentally called it several times , Canadia . My feet are killing me , though ... But it was sooo cool . 
Wheee The Renaissance Faire !! I'm going on Saturday !! :] 
Woohoo ! Just got back from the Renaissance Fair . It was fun ! I got a poison ring and a really cool necklace . :D 
White and black , gold and true . If you can guess what this is , I'm indebted to you . 
Sixteenth birthday is in July ... and I have absolutely no clue what I want to do for it . If anyone has any ideas , please do comment . 
A bit worried .. 
A break in the hull , a crack in the heart . What do you do when your world falls apart ? 
Whoo . Good day today , I do believe . Had fun at Reins From Above . Ate lunch at < PROPFEMALE > Garden . Tomorrow , the Flea Market with my momma . :] 
Noooo ... Fever , fever , go away , never come back any other day ... I have no time to be sick this week !.. 
Well ... Oh joy . Stuck at home with a fever . 
Well , I was feeling reallllyyy bad earlier but I feel better now , which is GOOD ! :D Hopefully it won't relapse again . Bleeegh . 
While you SCREAM at your woman , there's a\ 
man wishing he could talk softly to her ear . While you HUMILIATE , \ 
OFFENDand INSULT her , there's a man flirting with her and reminding her\ 
how wonderful she is . While you HURT your woman , there's a man wishing\

Domestic Violence . 
D: Not cool ... Was feeling better , then slowly got worse again , and I just barely made it to the bathroom before I lost what little I had eaten for the day ... 
Definitely goin to school tomorrow . Don't care how I feel , I'm going to the Ball !! 
Military Ball was awesome . I just hate that I started feeling sick at 10:20 so I didn't want to dance much after that ... And ended up getting sick .. Not cool . But I had fun regardless . I love all my ROTC friends . You guys are awesome . 
Well , got the verdict . I have bronchitis and possibly strep throat , waiting for the tests on that one . Suuucks . Hurts to pronounce certain letters and chew , swallow , yawn , etc ... Blleeegh . 
This friggin SUCKS . I dropped my iTouch in water and I have NO idea if it will still work ... I'm seriously upset .. That was an expensive little s . o . b ... I'm attempting the rice idea , but I dunno if it'll work , as I couldn't try it until about three thirty , and it dropped into water at about 10:30 ! >.< .... 
I try acting like a tomboy because I don't feel like I'm pretty , or elegant enough to be feminine and girly . \ 
\ 
I think that I also do it so I have an excuse for why boys don't like me . 
Well , still upset about my iTouch . That isn't cool , those things need to be waterproof ... :[ However , I'mma see what I can do about raising about ... 200$ to get another one . Ahh .. v_v However , in a better mood now . Spanish is almost done with !! 
Rawr . 
Well , now I have Silly Bandz .. A rhino , a glass slipper , and an alligator . XD One from the boyfriend , one from answering a question in english right , and the other from Jacy answering a question right and giving it to me . Ahaha . 
Two down , two to go ! WHOOT !!! SPANISH IS OVERRRR !!! NO MORE FRIGGIN \O AS A < PROPMALE > AIS AN \"!!!!!" 
Can I hear a \whoot whoot\ " for thunderstorms ? :D " 
Sooo close to the end of the school year ... I can almost taste itttt . Ahhh ! Might be going out with my boyfriend tomorrow night , that would be fun . It allll depends . If not tomorrow night , then definitely soon . 
You have GOT to be kidding me , people . I am friggin STRAIGHT . One hundred percent , NO doubt about it , STRAIGHT . I am SICK and tired of people making assumptions based on what I look like or what I wear !!! 
Anyone wanna come over ? -.- 
If you like this status , I will post on your wall something I like about you . Make this your status if you want a challenge . :) 
Yaaay , I found my camera . And counted alllll of my change . I have over 200 pennies ... Ooof . So I have $11.25 in change , then two gold dollar coins - 13.25 . Then four dollars in my little skull bank I didn't even know about , and a fifty cent coin . Grand total - $17.75 
* cough . Cough cough . COUGH HACK * Oh geez , is that a lung ?? v.v 
Oh yeah ! Deadliest Warrior is onnnn ! 
Spend the entire school year waiting for summer vacation , and when it comes around there is nothing to do . I am so booored . I wanna go somewhere or doooo somethingggg . T_T 
I don't understand adults sometimes . If you can't treat your child right , you don't deserve to be a parent ! If you can't be loving and caring and PATIENT AND UNDERSTANDING , then you are not fit to be a parent ! I love my momma very much , and as far as perfection comes , she's about on par with it ! And sometimes I really can't believe there are parents out there that AREN'T like her !! 
WOOHOO ! Had fun at the mountains . :D It was so nice up there , the weather was PERFECT ! I did not miss this heat , guys ! Haha . :] 
I have Silly Bandz now . :] 
Oof , just looked at some old pictures on dA ... GOD how did you people consider me good !? >.< 
HAPPY FOURTH OF JULY EVERYBODEH ! 
WHoa . I just found a bone in my popcorn chicken . .__. 
Does this darkness have a name ? \ 
This cruelty , this hatred\ 
How did it find us ? \ 
Did it steal into our lives , or did we seek it out and embrace it ? \ 
What happened to us ? \ 
That we now send our children into the world\ 
Like we send young men to war\ 
Hoping for their safe return\ 
But knowing some will be lost along the way\ 
When did we lose our way ? \ 
Consumed by the shadows , 
Like this status , and i will tell you what i like about you , dislike about you , a confession , and my first impression . :D 
Somehow , I have the vaguest feeling I'm going to be alone this weekend ... ._. 
Hey I found my pocket knife !!! :D Probably a liiiiittle too happy about that . 
And while I'm thinking about it , is ANY of my friends an Aries ? YES , there is a reason for my asking . 
Had a great day today ! :D Went to the Cheesecake Factory for lunch for my friend < PROPFIRST>'s birthday , then we went to the movies to see Avatar . We were there for two hours before our movie started , running around in the empty theatre ! Haha ! Then went to his house for cake and played Silent Hill 2 ! Had funnn ! 
Awh , I wish I had < PROPFEMALE > camera . I have a little dog - Peanut - all curled up against my leg and it's so cute . >.< 
Went to the < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > w/ Trace Adkins concert with my momma last night . It was so fun ! We had lawn tickets , but a friend of momma's had tickets to get up close and she took me up there . Stayed up there till the end , and got covered in confetti ! I had a blast ! <3 
Relaxin at my grandma's now . :] 
I love finding the seashells that have the perfect holes at the top . :] 
I forgot how immature some girls can get . HAHA ! Wooow . 
I sent someone a bit of a nasty messege . They deserved it . I wasn't too hateful . :] I just told a certain girl on how she needed to grow up because her pathetic little life obviously wasn't gonna get any better . :] 
Tired . Didn't get to sleep till , like , five last night . Woke up about .. thirty minutes ago . 
I really hate hypocrites . Like ... really , really hate them . And hate it even more when they get pissed off because you tell them something about it . 
< PROPFEMALE > , when your laptop battery lasts all of six minutes , I think that's a hint . v__v 
WOW . Me and my sister are actually on very good terms today . Like ... hugging . It's a miracle . 
I wanna see Inception and Despicable Me . >.< 
Now I'm doing an ' altered book ' cuz of my sister ... Haha . I really ' unno what to do with it . XD And years of \don't write in the books ! \ " are making me hesitant . Haha . " 
I feel like my ' ability ' to draw is directly corresponded to how I feel . If I'm in a bad mood ( i.e , sad , upset , angry ) then I can't draw worth crap . If I'm in a happy mood , I can't draw decently . 
This is cool . It's like my sister is my personal chef . XDDD 
\Forced to\ " my ... Ugh . I hate people so much sometimes . " 
Thanks everyone who wished me a Happy Birthday ! <3 
Yayyy ~ I had an awesome day todaaay . 
< PROPFEMALE > ... so ... school officials have apparently forgotten most parents have something called a job ... and the job usually lasts until about ... FIVE in the afternoon . So when you can pick up your schedule from Nine to THREE , there's a problem there . 
Haha , catching a lier in the middle of a lie ... Wondrous , truly . 
Suddenly , I feel worried . ._. 
Hm , missing my third block class in my second semester .. 
First Semester : Algebra II with Sabatino , ROTC II with < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > , Honors U.S History with Herring , and Honors Chemistry with Dawson . \ 
Second Semester : Spanish II with Lynch , ROTC with < PROPMALE > , I have no third block apparently , and Honors English III with Truitt . 
Mmmmmmmm browniezzz . :D 
Can no one take jokes anymore ? Friendly jokes ? I mean , really ? Height shouldn't be that controversial of a topic . Nor should age . I mean seriously ...

Too . Much . Homework . For the first day .

Haiiiircut today . Shorter now . Shorter than I wanted it , but it apparently looks good , as I was told by two strangers . So yeah ! 
I really , really want to just HURT something . Preferably someone . 
Got a VMI Reception Invitation today . Funfun . I'm curious , did anyone else I know get one ? 
Why is it I can hardly do anything anymore without feeling bad ... 
* heavy sigh * Oh brother ... 
RIP 9/11 victims and those who gave their lives to save them .

I will not murder , maim , or mutilate . Hopefully . 
My tooth hurts .. 
Oof , I guess I'd better start savin up my money again ..

Dear < PROPMALE > I wish I had some sort of talent . 
I hate hypocrites . Don't you dare sit there and tell me NOT to do something when you JUST did it not ten seconds before ! 
UGH ! Gow the heck am I supposed to make a graph and put it in an essay when I don't have anything that can do that !? 
I love my momma . She does whatever she can to help me and does everything she can to make me happy . She's the best momma in the world , no matter what anyone says . I love her very , very much . <3 
I have a feeling that me and my next semester english teacher will NOT be friends , if the words of my friends are anything to go by . 
Well , this would be the first time homework has made my head hurt . T T_T T 
YAY ! Now all I have to do is wait for < PROPFEMALE > momma to come home , and I can bake COOKIES !!! 
Baking cookies ... wish me luck . 
Oh people ... make up your minds ... Either you're with him , or you're not . 
Finally baking cookies and cupcakes . PROPER cookies . They look AWESOME so far . And I have AWESOME little cupcake things ' specially for Halloween ! 
Ohhh Brother . 
Why am I blamed for everything ? I am so sick and tired of it . It's getting to the point where I'm about ready to just say \Screw you \"." 
Made a discovery today ! Whenever the voice in my head yells , it has a decidedly < PROPFEMALE > accent . 
Whelp - got my tetanus shot today . Oooh , I did not want that needle near me . But I needed the shot , I suppose . Stepped on a nail last night . Ouuuch . 
I am sick and tired of being blamed for crap I have no control over , or have nothing to do with . STOP BLAMING ME . I swear . Stop being so frickin rude to me , stop blaming me , and frickin GROW UP . 
Momma cut her hand pretty bad . Hit her artery . * shudder * That was odd . Like , really odd . But she's okay now . Three stitches . 
Just got done putting together \mini-gifts\ " . :] " 
You never really realize how much you depend on someone until you can't talk to them .

So , yesterday , me and Kierstyn are walking home from the bus stop and we hear this really , really evil kinda sound . There are fifty or so birds - we think crows - that are up in the trees , cawing or doing whatever . They sounded CREEPY . A really horrid chorus . Well , today , momma opens the sliding glass door , and there are even MORE crows out there , and it's even louder . Kinda ominous/creepy , if you ask me . 
You and I wake up to the Zombie Apocalypse . Using only four words , what do you say to me ? 
WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY ?! Any other day . I would have welcomed this early release - four hours - BUT NOT TODAY ! D: 
Stupid . Snow . STUPID STUPID SNOW . 
Watching \Amish Paradise\ " and remembering when we watched it in Mrs. Pearce's English class ... I miss it alreadyyyy . She was awesome ! " 
There are those days I can kill her . \ 
Then there are those days I can ... Wait no . There are only days where I could kill her . \ 
-_- 
CSI shall be an interesting class . 
Dear parents : You did NOT have a child just so they could do all the work and you could be lazy . You did NOT have a child just so that it gave you a gratified reason to stop working around the house . You STILL have to love your child and treat them with respect . YES . Respect . You did NOT have a child to abuse them , mentally OR physically . Get your friggin facts STRAIGHT . Or so help me God , I will do it for you . 
I have a kitten biting on my nose . 
< PROPFIRST > count : 1 ! \ 
Lol ... \ 
I dislike < PROPFIRST > s day . -_-; 
I dislike you couples . 
Stupid < PROPMALE > paper .

I am relieved about not having to worry about the < PROPMALE > paper anymore . Unless I fail . That would suck . 
Heheeheheee . Goood day . 
Good day ! Very , very good day ~ ! 
\I'm the bad guy ! I don't save the day 
Laptop is severely messing up . Keeps freezing . I dunno what's wrong with it , since I've done nothing new with it and I recently cleaned it up ... 
Today has not been a great day . 
Why ? I notice a lot of people - dA , mostly - complain when an artist puts up a picture to support Japan . They say that they should be donating rather than drawing . Why complain ? Just like a singer shows their support by writing a song , an artist shows theirs by drawing a picture . It doesn't mean they're not trying anything . It means they want a public way to show their support . So shut up and stop complaining .
