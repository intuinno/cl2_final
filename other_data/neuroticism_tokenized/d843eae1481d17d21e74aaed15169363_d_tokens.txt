Very scary ice storm going on ! Power went out and I can hear trees breaking in the woods across the street ! Luckily , my mother-in-law still has power and can't hear very well !

Just got my computer working again after the power failure last week ! Wooo-hoooo ! Apparently the CMOS needed resetting . Hmm ? Yeah . Me neither . 
I am confused about why the Egyptians think they are free (\We are FREE !!! \") when power has been placed in the military's hands . Isn't this the same military that supported Mubarak and has their own issues ? Are they really just going to start planning free elections now ? " 
Reports have been coming in from < PROPFIRST > all evening . It appears that < PROPMALE > Morrison cannot stop rolling over in his grave . The French Government is requesting that no more Doors songs be performed on American Idol .
