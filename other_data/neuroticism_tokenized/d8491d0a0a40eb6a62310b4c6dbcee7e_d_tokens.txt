“Any change , even a change for the better , is always accompanied by drawbacks and discomforts . ” 
“Success means having the courage , the determination , and the will to become the person you believe you were meant to be” 
“It's because we're so trapped in our culture , in the being of being human on this planet with the brains we have , and the same two arms and legs everybody has . We're so trapped that any way we could imagine to escape would be just another part of the trap . Anything we want , we're trained to want . ”

ms. collins has a colorful personality :P 
i just lost a piece of poetry that I was actually proud of :/ 
I found the poetry that I lost :D 
For every person that's not right for you takes you a step closer to the One who is . 
Don't choose the one who is beautiful to the world , but rather choose the one who makes your world beautiful . 
When two people are meant for each other , no time is too long , no distance is too far , and no one can ever tear them apart . 
The hardest part of my life is not being able to be with you , when you said you would be there forever .

When we met you said we were the same , you know\ 
that we're different , we're different , \ 
and all the times you promised me that everything would\ 
work out in the end , you were gravely mistaken . 
happy Halloween everyone :D 
When I'm lying in your bed .. play the motions through my head you know that I'm thinking , I'm thinking ... that I have reasons to believe that I'm not the only one you spend this time with , but I'll stay ... 
Who's laughing now ? \ 
Blood pours from her dry mouth as she begs for mercy\ 
Oh , how she screams ! \ 
If you think you'll win my forgiveness\ 
Aww , sweetheart , you're sadly mistaken ! \

\You know what’s crazy ? when you keep loving someone that will never be yours because it feels good having that feeling even if it hurts . \"" 
I choose to love you in silence , for in silence I found no rejection . 
If its the guy crying over the girl , you know that guy is really in love .

The beauty of a woman is not in the clothes she wears , the figure that she carries , or the way she combs her hair . The beauty of a woman must be seen from in her eyes , because that is the doorway to her heart , the place where love resides . - < PROPFEMALE > Hepburn

God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world , but that the world through Him might be saved . < PROPFIRST > 3:17 
Trying to make someone fall in love with you is about as pointless as trying to control who you fall in love with . 
No temptation has seized you except what is common to man . And God is faithful ; He will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear . But when you are tempted , He will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it . 1 Corinthians 10:13

There is something beautiful about all scars of whatever nature . A scar means the hurt is over , the wound is closed and healed , done with . 
When you thought you’ve moved on the person from your past returns and complicates everything 
The worst way to miss someone is to have them sitting right next to you and know you can never have them . 
When a heart is true , there’s no need for words , because even in silence , love can be heard . 
Pleasing everybody is never a responsibility . If they like you for who are , good . If not , its their problem not yours . 
I don't wish to be everything to everyone . I just wish to be something to someone . 
happy birthday miley < PROPMALE > :P 
morning everyone

I don't pretend to know what love is for everyone , but I can tell you what it's for me ; love is knowing all about someone , and still wanting to be with them more than any other person , love is trusting them enough to tell them everything about yourself , including the things you might be ashamed of , love is feeling comfortable and safe with someone , but still gettin weak knees when they walk into a room smiling at you . 
“One of the hardest things in life is having words in your heart that you can't utter . ” 
“It takes a minute to have a crush on someone , an hour to like someone and a day to love someone - but it takes a lifetime to forget someone . ” 
“Just so you know , there's a space that only you can fill . Just so you know , I loved you then , I guess I always will . ” 
“When you smiled you had my undivided attention . When you laughed you had my urge to laugh with you . When you cried you had my urge to hold you . When you said you loved me , you had my heart forever . ” 
“The minute a man ceases to grow , no matter what his years , that minute he begins to be old . ” 
Kids with special needs aren't sick or gross or stupid , and their handicap is not contagious . They only want what we all want : to be accepted and loved . Can I make a request : Is anyone willing to post this and leave it as your status for at least an hour ?

“I fear being like everyone I hate , I fear failure , I fear losing control . I love balancing between chaos and control with everything I do .

As Plato sometimes speaks of the divine love , it arises not out of indigency , as created love does , but out of fullness and redundancy ; it is an overflowing fountain , and that love which descends upon created being is a free efflux from the almighty source of love ; and it is well pleasing to him that those creatures which he hath made should partake of it .

A soulmate is someone who has locks that fit our keys and keys to fit our locks . When we feel safe enough to open the locks our truest selves step out and we can be completely and honestly who we are ; we can be loved for who we are and not for who were pretending to be . Each unveils the best part of the other . No matter what else goes wrong around us with that one person were safe in our own paradise .

When I die I want to be known for something . I don't want to be like every other person , I want to be different and make an impact on the world . When I die I want to be buried under a bed of wildflowers to let people know how wild and free I was . I wonder if they'll even miss me when I die .

at some point you will realize that you have done too much for someone or something , that the only next possible step to do is to stop . leave them alone . walk away . it’s not like you’re giving up , and it’s not like you shouldn’t try . it’s just that you have to draw the line of determination from desperation . what is truly yours would eventually be yours , and what is not , no matter how hard you try , will never be . 
What's ? so good about picking up the pieces ? <3 
I forgot that I have family on facebook :P \ 
but , I am still Powder Evans baby daddy :{ D

I have a feeling that's it's going to be weird the first day of school knowing that I won't be in band , at a completely different school with just 93 students this year and , most likely , I won't see half of my friends again in real life for a long time . Wait , maby I'll see most of you at westfield games . 
What are everyone's plans for the summer ?
