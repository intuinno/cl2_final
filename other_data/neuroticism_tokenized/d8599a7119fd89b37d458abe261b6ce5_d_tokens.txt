Just got back from a lil party with some family friends - Pretty good , they're fun people =) Now I need something to do and someone to hang/talk with XP 

Ugh ! Guys can be such a**-holes !... * sigh * but , what can I say , I STILL love ' em . =) 
... bending so far , I thought I would have broke , but the time is draging , just so I can feel it all ... 
Sometimes , life hands you something you didn't expect or want , but no matter how much it really hurts ... I guess you gotta push through it ... yuck this sucks ... 
Back to my boring , slow life at home . Where is the fun in that ?! No inspiration or excitement EVER ! Haha ! But at least < PROPFEMALE > ( my bestest friend EVER ! ) gave me an iPod for an EARLY b-day present . 8D THANKS , < PROPFEMALE > ! LUV YA , FOR < PROPFEMALE > ! Haha =P 
I'm SO bored right now ! It's not even funny , and all my friends seem to either be busy , not on the CP now , or even out of state ... NOW what am I suppose to do ? 
I've got my life back in order ... sorta ... kinda ... well , for now . And I will no doubt be back to being my crazy self soon . I mean , there is still a month and so-so days of summer left and I haven't even done all the things I want to do yet . So now it's time 
Run , < PROPMALE > , Run ! Haha , 9 more days until Warped Tour and I can kick it with some of the coolest bands of all time ! 8D 
Okay , I'm officially pissed off . At , pretty much , everything . Ugh ! This is a time where I'm in dire need of venting , but I have no way to do it ! >_< ( That's a scrunchy mad face , btw ) 
I will never forget yesterday and everything that happened . It was the most amazing thing ever spent with my best friend . And not only that , I met my favorite band and my idols . Music will never sound the same , not when the only way I wanna hear it is pre 
I sooo don't want to go camping this weekend ! Usually , I'm fine with it , it's kinda fun , but this weekend , this YEAR ... ugh ! I so , don't wanna be at Thiseldew for a week/weekend with no shower and soap ! 
the world falls down , but i seem to be the only one that goes with it ... sometimes life is really unfair handing you those dang lemons , and when u wanna make that lemonaide , turns out the lemons are rotten and the sugar has ants .... ( that ttly did not sound lame * roll eyes *) 
Hmm ... I just got back from watching District 9 ( something like that ) and it was REALLY good ! Ha ! There was a lot of explosions , gun fights , and flying people/alien/parts almost the whole movie . It was wierd at the beginning , but it got WAY better . 8P 
Just got back from < PROPFEMALE>'s! Wish I could have gotten more/better presents for ya b-day , and that Samuelson coulda come , but it was still pretty kick-a** ! =P 
Goin back to v-town to go to my dad's house for the week til Sunday or Monday ( have no clue yet ) AAAAAAAND , I'm getting my hair done TOMORROW !!! It's gonna be soooooo SWEE-EET !! =P 
School tomorrow ! YaaaaayyyyyyyYUCK ! Haha , but , remember , Henryz ! I'm saving youz a seat on the bus , so ya better be there ! =P 
School sucked , but it was alright for what it was . Was it : hot , extremely so ; fun , slightly ; exhausting , of course ; boring , well duh ! Haha , is school ever NOT at least a BIT boring ? =} 
Good news - I HAVE NO HOMEWORK ! =] 
Ugh , so bored lately ! I need some excitement in my life , some thrills , just ANYTHING would be nice ! Haha , come on ! Bring on that fun ! =P 
The Hangover was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen ! XD 
Ugh ! It's just so depressing that so many hilarious people of the 70's & 80's have died - Wishing that < PROPFIRST > Farley & < PROPFIRST > Belushi were still with us !!! ( Among others of course X3 ) 
Ugh ! I'm so confused and bottled up , but a few good things have happened lately , hmm , lemme see here - Might get a python ( XD ) , had a few really really good laughs , met some fun people , and found the car of my dreams ( Black 1967 Chevrolet Impala , 2-door , hardtop) !!!! 
Leaving to the DR's in a bit , but , at least I got to sleep in an hour , and I miss a little school =] 
Oh , ugh , most supremely depressed ! Now I remember that there's an Anti-Flag concert on Thursday in St. Paul with flippin Aiden , The Mezingers , and Cancer Bats !!!! NO FAIR !!!! ='( 
Rest In Peace : < PROPFIRST > ( The Rev ) Sullivan ='( One of the world's most wicked drummers is surely gonna be missed 
Stressed the heck out ! I have this dang Annotated Bibliography to do , finish my persuasive paper , figure out my money matters plan book final , and study for all my other finals DX 
New classes , don't really care who is in them with me , but I REALLY wanna know who has Lunch A with me this semester - Sitting alone is so lame , haha , who's gonna be my lunch buddy(-ies) ??? XP haha 
I don't have friends in EVERY hour , but this semester's classes are gonna be really fun I think XP - Yay Spanish II !!! Haha 
Wait for iiiiit . Wait for iiiiit !... Nevermind . Haha , I just went , like , running around outside tackling < PROPFEMALE > , but now I'm soaking and COLD , BUT - I'm still kinda hyper ... Hmmm , still bored ~ People should text me , and call me , aaaand OOH , I still gotta get together with people this weekend , so , let's see what happens now X3 
Ugh , I'm so cold right now that I can't stop trembling , heh - Maybe I should run like crazy and see if THAT warms me up =P 
I have a song , just , stuck in my head , and I have NO FREAKING CLUE what it IS !! Hahaha , isn't that just horrible ??? And I know it won't go away til I figure it out * sigh * Oh well , it's kinda catchy for now =P 
Home again , and I don't really care , ha - I'm just extremely exhausted , feel like I'm gonna fall off my feet any second , but I can't seem to get to sleep . Need someone to give me an idea that will knock me out til I have to get up at 5:30 ! Haha , don't you just love school ? =P 
Ever have one of those funny moments where all of a sudden the people you REALLY don't like just give you a good laugh over something they did ?? Well , I just did , and boy , I still don't understand why it's so dang funny !! XD 
I'm REALLY REALLY REALLY ( times infinity ) happy&hyper & Idek WHY !! XD Hahaha - OOH ! People should text meh ! < Sammie's word : hippolarconinsomniaphobia ! Hahaha , I ? U ! > 
Got home again from V-town and the Dad's , heh - But I'm REALLY bored now & lately been thinking bout everyone of my friends and stuff from all my past schools ... Whatever happened to those Orr Braves , Cook Gophers , and < PROPFEMALE > Blue devils ? I wanna talk with them all again :-) 
Love the Winter Olympics - Mainly just Snowboarding , Downhill skiing , and figure sakting - but who won he men's finals in snowboarding with Holland and Wescott ??? O.o 
< Your presence isn't what kills me ; It's that artistic gleam ; It's taking over my scenery ; dream by dream > ~ \She's Got Style\ " : NeverShoutNever " 
Ah jeez ! Haha , just got back home about , eh , maybe a little over 30 minutes ago - And my hair is really blonde !! Not ALL blonde , but for the most part it IS blonde - All I gotta say is ... wieeeeerd . Haha XD 
People surprise me everyday . Those I have hated , or refuse to even acknowledge , sometimes show a side that I never expected , or something , no matter how many times it hits me , I almost don't want to see ... And those I love with show that rare ugly side that I shy away from because ... I love them . It's weird what you do & don't see , especially when you have one of the world's most stubborn outlooks .... 
< Tattoos and a switchblade attitude ; Snakebite heart with a bubblegum smile ; Sex in stereo , don't turn the radio dial > Lost In Stereo : All Time Low ( Freaking love this song XD ) 
Duck , duck , SUPER PLASMOID MONKEY MAN - Wait ! What IS that ?! AWWW , < PROPFIRST > Save Meeeeee ...... * moop * 
HEY ! I was watching the Minnesota State Hockey Tournement 6th hour in English - Yes , in school , haha - And I saw < PROPFEMALE > ! WAY TO GO ! Tell me if the Devils won or not =] 
ihitasquirrelitchangedmylife ... Hahaha ! The title alone is completely amazing & the song is just as sweet ! XP Check out EATMEWHILEIMHOT ! ~ And if that isn't your thing there's always NeverShoutNever P.S. Same singer ( Christofer < PROPFIRST > Ingle ) X3 
Had an awesome day today ~ Got to skip school to go to Duluth ; Went shopping & got some perfumes , a BVB band tee , and GAUGES ! Then we went t the IMAX and saw < PROPFEMALE > in 3D - Total sweetness . Haha =P 
Ugh ! Sooooo tired & yet , sooooo not - Make sense ? Yeah , me either , and I don't have ANYTHING to do right now . Just watching Miracle At St. < PROPFEMALE > ~ Oh ! And I have NO CELL anymore =/ Tried to use it Thursday for the first time & it's permanently dead . Suckage . 
Make me smile and you'll be one of the most incredible people ever ; make me break and all you'll be is another small crack in my already deteriorating features - Which will you be to me ? 
I wonder what would happen if you mixed a zebra & a giraffe ? O.o Hmm ... That'd be SWEET ! I think I'd call it a zebraffe 
=) Peope are amazing - most the time - I just can't stop smiling now at how easy a person just made me melt . I never liked ' em , and even now I'm stubborn to even acknowledge that they have good in them , but sometimes , they give a little glimpse and it's more miraculous & kind & sweet then I could ever have thought possible coming from them ... =) 
Awww !!! X3 Today is so pretty out ! I think I'm just gonna go lay out on the deck or something =] 
What happened to all my hair ?!?! DX ...... Oh yeeeeah - That's right - I CHOPPED it all off =) 
Today was ... AMAZING ! Haha , I mean , it was pretty awesome =) Classes were boring as ever , but the day went by fast , laughed so much and so hard my face turned red and I couldn't breathe , and was all around great XP But Steph nearly scared the crap outta me by hiding under my bed and then grabbing my ankle when I walked by - Now my throat hurts =/ Haha 
Just finished The Boondock Saints .... Awesome ! One of the best movies EVER 
< But all I ever wanted to do ; Was to fall in love ; Just to be in love ; But my heart was racing ; My mind was screaming ; \You've got your whole life to do these things \"; But my legs were shaking ; My hands were searching for her ; In the backseat of my car ; I just lost it ; And I can't believe it > Losing It - NeverShoutNever ( Change the her to him and this song is all bout me ~ I love music =] ) " 
Okay , something is up =( So happy lately but this dang grade thing has really brought me down ~ Doing crap in my History , English , and Spanish classes ; Like THE worst possible & I have no freaking idea what I'm gonna do ='( 
Hey - By the waaaay ... Who wants to go to Warped Tour with me this summer ??? =] It'd be the bomb all the way =P 
Why when faced with the “tangible” possibility of Jesus do people have to go mental ? Say every little piece to disprove its theories , insult people/profession , or even get insulted ? Dont believe in God/Jesus – Your choice . Not your religion – Fine . But dont go all angry debatical & what not . Skepticisms ? State em & relax . I thought of this after \THE FACE IN THE SHROUD\ " on MSN & I know I sound COMPLETELY cheesy . " 
Wrapped in a huge blanket and feeling warm all over =) Ha , I can't believe a person could make me feel like this - It's weird , but amazing ; And add some extremely amazing music afterwards on top of it & it makes things superb ! Haha =P 
I'm not mean , you're just an idiot - Just Kidding !! Haha ~ I love being in a good mood , wish I could make it perfect ;P Haha 
Man ! I really wish I coulda gone on the band trip ; It actually looked like you all had FUN ! Hahaha =P 
fullständigt och borras totalt ! Så borrat i faktum , det har jag < PROPFEMALE > allt i svensk ( Hahahaha ! I love Swedish XD ) 
Okay - This is bugging me as much as my friend , so just leave them alone and get out of their business ! It's none of anyone else's unless they come to you and trust you to talk about it with ; So shut < PROPFEMALE > mouths and bug off - Alright ? 
I just got the 4th season of Supernatural and some really neat looking book - SCORE ! Hey , don't judge , I only have really 3 BIG obsessions : Music , books ( literature in general really ) , and certain tv shows - So let me have my fun ;P 
Today was very interesting , haha , but all-in-all I guess successful =) And since I'm in a fairly good mood , I'll say sorry to the people I've said horrible things to and about . Oh & NO ONE scares the crap outta me making me scream in front of the band !! BEWARE !! Haha - < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > , T-Ra , etc etc etc I LOVE YOU !!! X3 
thinking either doing PSEO ( post secondary ) or online schooling - Don't know which I'd prefer . Things stress and even though 2 years of college would be great to get done , it seems online would be much much easier to deal with . 
The road waits for me as the engine starts to run ; Say our goodbyes they just watch as I go , < PROPMALE > my dreams and let some go ; This is me 
Silly silly little people . Don't you think I know you talk about me ? Don't you think I know you talk about my friends and family ? Just know it doesn't faze me , because in the end , you're the one that is pitied above all else - And if you were to hurt my friends or family ; All I have to say is you need to grow eyes in the back of your head ASAP =] 
Only had 4.5 classes today , haha - Thank god for cheesy Grease X ) By the way , I look around at people today and it surprised me how we actually got OLD - Well ... not old-old persay , but , you know what I mean Time to get back to writing lyrics and stories , and putting pieces together =] 
You really should have kept it in your pants I'm hearing dirty stories from your friends Maybe you shouldn't , oh-oh Kiss and tell You're looking like a tool and not a baller You're acting like a chick why bother I can find someone way hotter With a bigger ... well 
is sooo bored ! There's no one to talk to or text , ha - Oh , and just to let you all know ; My Sister's Keeper was a HORRIBLE movie , seriously , waaaay too drawn out and dry for my taste , heh 
It's a little bit cool out but hey ! Looking out the window at Silver Lake and everything starting to get green is gorgousness !! Silver Lake almost looks like a normal , non-toxic lake X ) 
had a random random RANDOM thought today that once mighta been a possibility but really isn't now ... hmm ... I daydreamed pretty much ALL DAY that I really really wanted to start up a band . I mean , WTF , haha - I can't play guitar , bass , or drums , and I'm sure as heck not even that good of singer . Weirdness happens in my mind sometimes , haha 
UGH ~ Brain HURTS !!! Dang Mr. LaRoque's History project & Dang 4th quarter stresses ! >.<

Sat outside , ran around with the dogs , watched about 2 hours or so of anime , then sat down and read all of The Short Second Life of < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > in one sitting ~ I'm so happy !! XD 
I feel , like , totally accomplished X ) \ 
I made brinner and it just rocked to the core , haha ; But of course , later when I looked at the disaster that was the remains of our kitchen , I wished I hadn't had to make anything - Lets just say , pancake batter , spray , and egg tends to stick to , oh , EVERYTHING

Ill never hate you or forget you ; You've crawled your way into my heart & soul . And even now - the way things are between us & others - Ill never quit loving you =] 
At first , I didn't really like The Last Airbender movie , but after a while it was like freaking awesome !! Haha , the only thing I thought stupid at the end was pronunciations and the fact that it was only Book 1 & they prolly won't make the others 
Heheheh , I laughed so hard this morning & all because I scared myself over a song I could sing X'D 
Inception was pretty damn cool .. Haha , but other than that I'm really bored ~ Needa plan with someone who is NOT working X3\

Ugh .. Headache beyond belief , and I don't know which pain is causing it , haha ~ Guess I'll try to make my auntie a pic like I promised : Miss you , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > !!
