2 Words , Nutella Pancakes . 
The definition of Family : any group of persons closely related by blood , as parents , children , uncles , aunts , and cousins . The problem with that is I don't have any family . I have aunts & uncles who have not spoken to me in 10+ yrs , cousins whom I've never met or feel it's a bother when I talk to them , Parents who have yet to realize their wrong-doings & siblings who are immature & childish . 
Put that in your juice box and suck it !

Say Please and Thank You . Smile . Look someone in the eye when they speak to you . Don't get caught up in the hustle & bustle that is Christmas , instead take a step back & realize how you treat people . 
Despite the crazy Snow , we've been pretty busy !! So let all the crazies come out !

Romans 5:2 -4 Through him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand , and we rejoice in hope of the < PROPFEMALE > of God .

With $10 you can skip that drive-thru breakfast or those couple beers after work . Please everyone text HAITI to 90999 to give $10 for the disaster relief . Unfortunately they are not letting church groups go so even though I signed up to leave only medical professionals & military are there now . BUT at least we can help out this way . 
It frustrates me when peoples status ' are about how horrible their life is bc they spent too much $ @ the store or their bf/husband is annoying them when there are people who have lost their entire families , haven't eaten in days & have to watch as their children die caught under rubble of a natural catastrophe . Seriously give me a freaking break ! 
Do NOT post fml or ihml because then you truly are selfish , arrogant , conceited , ignorant of your surroundings and a hopeless person and this goes to show people need to be better human beings . or our race as we know it is going down the toilet !
