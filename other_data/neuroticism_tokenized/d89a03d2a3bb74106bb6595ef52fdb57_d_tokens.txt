is it trashy to wear a pair of jeans that are ripped around the thigh ? I mean , you can't see my underwear or anything . Other than the rip , they're my favorite pair of jeans , and I just can't bear to part with them .

If I had a boyfriend , A Walk Through Hell would be our song . Whether he liked it or not . 
may actually record a vid of herself singing and post it tomorrow . The question is ... What song ? 
had to < PROPFEMALE > 4 text books+binder all day . But , the Toll House Cookie Cafe made it all better . Why don't I live there ? I think I'm going to start doing my homework there every day .

How do you make a crappy week better ? Suggestions , please ! 
has to do ( about ) 210 Algebra 2 problems tonight because I accidentally did the wrong homework . I feel really bad , but I think I need to transfer out of her class . There is no way I can survive much longer . This week can only get better . 
do I even bother doing my math homework ? Oh , I don't know ... 
So in my All Quiet on the Western Front book , someone wrote \My name is < PROPFIRST > and I write on my book\ " underneath I wrote \ " My name is Gennavieve and writing in books makes me feel rebellious . \""

You can ask me any question , no matter what it is . You have my FULL , 100% honesty , but I DARE you to make this your status and see what questions you get . 
' s grades were so fantastic , she got TWO report cards ! And they screwed up my GPA . I got straight As , how can I get a 3.8 GPA ? 
It's Sami Day ! Planning out loads of fun things to do ... :D Watch < PROPFEMALE > , get the peppermint bark recipe , make cookies , decorate them , oh , and do homework .

just made the best present for Secret < PROPFEMALE > tomorrow . It's so good , I think I'll make more so everyone can have one . 
I dunno if anyone was serious when they said they wanted to play hide-and-seek in IKEA , but I actually was . So , anyone want to get together and drive to the IKEA in Emeryville on Monday or Tuesday next week ? If I get enough comments/likes , I'll make the event . 
Blech . No IKEA I guess ? Going to learn/choreograph the Bad Romance dance . Maybe make the vid this Saturday ? 
just pulled out her contact from the back of her eyeball . Maybe I should make a book about my adventures . I bet it'd be popular . 
Hm . Life can be pretty twisted sometimes . 
Blech . Might have to cancel IKEA trip . Now what am I going to do with my Monday ? 
Two Christmas parties today . Yayyy . Tomorrow , might make vid with < PROPMALE > with our new Monsters Inc hat . :) 
\When I first saw < PROPFIRST > I felt like god had taken a bunch of diamonds and made a gift just for me . \"" 
wants to petition to get schools to teach < PROPMALE > Potter in English class . With a book like that , you can be guaranteed kids will actually do the reading . Also , there's some amazing symbolism in there . Eh ? 
feels like being creative ... any ideas ? 
wants to be a Southern < PROPFEMALE > . 
since < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > won't respond to my txts , I guess I'm just going to stay home and dress up in the large collection of costumes that I own . I'm a weirdo and proud of it ! 
just watched her cat jump in through the window . Then she slipped and fell . And landed on her feet . 
It's Christmas Day with my mommy ! :) Got some really cool things . The new iPod nano , inside-out < PROPMALE > Mints , mocassins , clothes , and these awesome mittens !

Got a webcam and Wii for Christmas ! And X-files season 5 ! My holiday break is complete . :) 
just saw Nine . Story could have been rewritten a bit , but the metaphors , choreography , score , and acting was superb . :) Loooved it . 
Wow . I spent 3 hours home alone waiting for my dad to get the ingredients for dinner , only to find out he went to eat at a friend's house with my brother . 
San < PROPFIRST > is one beautiful city . I am totally , absolutely , crazy in love with that place . 
really needs to do something creative today . But ... What ? 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , we need to think of a group name . Now . 
UGHHH . Everything on my iPod got deleted . And all of my stuff is split between two computers . FML . 
is making a music video tomorrow . < PROPMALE > and I want to make a video of us playing < PROPFIRST > Kart , but live . We'll be dressed up as characters riding cardboard boxes throwing Koopa shells that we make . Is that the coolest thing you've ever heard , or what ? 
< PROPMALE > now won't make the music video I wanted to make because he wanted to make the < PROPFIRST > Kart vid first . What he doesn't realize is that video takes more preparation , and we wouldn't even be able to film until tomorrow . We don't even have the freaking boxes .... GRRRRRR . 
loves < PROPMALE > Bemis . 
doesn't have much to do today but do homework . Fuuuuuuuun . Txt me please , save me from my misery .

ROFL . The PG&E guy just went up to my door and knocked . We made eye contact , but I didn't move . Two minutes after he left , all of the power in my house shut off . Well played , PG&E guy , well played . 
Did not start this year off very well . I feel awful :( 
The < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Experience will make me feel better , right ? 
has been having some weird dreams . Last night , I dreamed I had an immaculate < PROPFEMALE > , and it was the day my baby was due , but I still went to school . And then I got checked into the hospital even though my water didn't break or anything . But it was so realistic ... When I woke up , I couldn't tell if it happened or not . o.O Weiiird .

Ohhhhhmygoodness . I love Youth in Revolt . Not as good as the book , but how could it be ? I mean , the book was great . But the movie made Sheeni far more likeable , and the whole Nick/Francois thing was done SO well . I loved it . I may have a weird kinda not really infatuation with < PROPFIRST > Cera . 
Just because you want to , ask me anything in the whole wide world . http://www.formspring.me/Evie

I know , everyone seems to have these . But ... you should still ask me anonymous questions :) http://www.formspring.me/Evie

Today I decided i wanted to be a fashion designer but only to make a clothing line for men that is called < PROPMALE > , and a women's clothing line called Bad Romance The ads would say \Wear < PROPMALE >\" and \ " Get caught in Bad Romance clothing\ " . <--- This is what my brother thinks about in bed . ILY < PROPMALE > . lol " 
OMG . FREAKING DOUBLE STANDARDS . My mom is so strict with me , and then all rules go out the window with my brother . All she said was , \It's < PROPMALE > . I trust him . \ " What ? She doesn't trust me ? It's not like I'm a slut ! "

OKAY . I'll write my essay . But ... I need help . I don't know what to do ! 
I guess it's video games and homework today . Oh , babysitting tonight ! :D

OMG . If I don't go as a censored streaker for Halloween , I'm going as a homeless robot , with a sign asking for money -- written in binary . Brilliant . 
Only like 2 more paragraphs and minor editing ! Woohoo ! 
Uh-oh . I think my essay is really really good . That MUST mean it is terrible . Oh well , I'm too tired to care .

AHHHHH . Rent auditions . Do I do it ? 
Well this pretty much sucks . Oh well . Any ideas of a post-70s pop/rock song for my audition ? 
D: I don't want to audition alone ! 
Audition confirmed ! What do you think of using That is Why by Say Anything for an audition song ? 
Honestly . Does anyone know of any good pop/rock songs , that are kinda Rent-esque ? I'm thinking some older Pink song , That is Why by Say Anything , or After Hours by We Are Scientists . Any more suggestions ? Or votes ? 
So far , I know like no one in my classes . No Period 1 , P2- Alg 2 , Thompson , P3- Spanish 2B , Grobmeier , P4- Drama 3 , Watts , P5- History , Frye , P6- Adv Theater Wkshop .

Not very happy today . Might write a screenplay , maybe make an informational video for Awkward Thursday . Any ideas ? 
< PROPFIRST > Kimmel is so freaking funny . 
Eating raviolis and < PROPMALE > & < PROPFIRST>'s ( not together ) while watching movies is the perfect cure for what I'm feeling . Or maybe I'll read me some < PROPFIRST > Wilde . 
And dying when you're not really sick is really sick , y'know . Really . 
Head to the Civic Center Library at 3:30 today for Book Trailers ! Bring your friends and make a video \selling\ " your favorite book ! ( I'm filming them :>) " 
is so tired . I need my rest for Awkward Thursday ! 
Glasses or contacts tomorrow ? Hm . 
Happy Awkward Thursday ! And BSOL Day ;] 
I really suck at allowing . People annoy me way too easily . Or maybe , everyone is just being a jerk . 
Today was the worst Awkward Thursday of all time . :( 
:( I never get to see anyone anymore . What is up with that ? 
has pressing moral issues she needs to ponder . : l 
had a really crappy week . But it was almost completely made up for when JT and I rolled up each other into burritos . :) 
is once again afraid of sleeping . :\\ Why can't I be afraid of spiders like normal people ? 
has a HUGE garage sale at her house . Seriously , there is so much stuff , we could have opened up a thrift store for the day . 
is ( hopefully ) going to Strizzis and Cafe < PROPMALE > . :) 
took two naps today , and managed to finish her watercolor and color a picture for Sami . 
is feeling super creative today ! Working on my Secret Leprechaun gift , going to Cafe < PROPMALE > ( fer sure this time ) , and planning my screen play all day ! 
is not excited for school . If you see me tomorrow , you should say something random to make my day . :D 
Well , I'm ready 30 minutes early . I guess I'll do the math homework I \forgot\ " to do . Sigh . " 
had a good day :) I enjoyed talking to people I don't normally talk to . 
cannot find her Rent DVD . D: Nor her < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE>'s Infinite Playlist DVD ! 
Wanna hear a joke ? The CAHSEEs . 
DANG . < PROPFIRST > Zachow almost hit that REALLY high note in the solo in Seasons of Love . Now if she did that for the Variety Show and our audition ... ;] 
Now that's a real shame when folks be throwin ' away a perfectly good white boy like that . 
RJTKRSEFHGM Back to square one . I didn't realize I couldn't find sheet music for Total Eclipse of the Heart in the key I needed it in . So , maybe I'll work on something else . I would LIKE to do Call Me When You're Sober , but it'd be better if I was going for < PROPFEMALE > ... 
I wonder how many people have deleted me from their news feed . Hmmmm . 
I hate myself sometimes . Okay . So for audition songs for Rent , I have Something to Talk About , or an Alanis Morissette song . And I'm psyched about either , so that's a good sign ! 
< PROPFIRST > and her boyfriend are so funny . Well . Mainly her boyfriend . Haha . 
You know it's spring when I finally decide it's time to wear shorts , lol . I'm going to miss you , jeans . :( 
Weird day . I ended up making a fool of myself every < PROPMALE > I got . Though , good news : My mom has fallen through on her promise to put < PROPMALE > down . ( Note : < PROPMALE > . Not < PROPMALE > . That'd be illegal . ) 
;] Mannnn . I miss my < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > Zachow . Hopefully I'll see them both tomorrow ! 
likes you . ;] 
OMMIGOD , OMMIGOD YOU GUYS . :) Seeing Legally Blonde the Musical tonight . I love going to musicals ! 
Gah . FML . >.< 
I must seem bipolar today , lol . BUT YAY ! Buying two new baby chicks today :) We're getting a Plymouth Rock and a Rhode Island Red , I think . Hopefully my racist dog won't kill the Plymouth Rock ... Again . 
got home at midnight , wish I could have stayed longer in the city . Legally Blonde was great :) I loved the Emmet and < PROPMALE > . And , of course , the UPS guy . I stagedoored and got practically everyone's autograph except < PROPFEMALE>'s . :) Pretty good night . 
Obock Brahma will not shut up ! And she keeps trying to push herself underneath Chickeil O'Neil so that Chickeil is like sitting on top of her lol . I'm not sure what she's trying to accomplish from that , but it's pretty cute lol . 
My plan for the last 10 or so weeks of school : Pretend I'm not actually at school , but at a different place each day . Tomorrow may be Hogwarts . Next Monday may be a < PROPMALE > where I may celebrate Lumberjack Monday . Who knows ! 
So many things happening , it's hard to keep them straight ! I'm just going to ignore it all and pretend life has never been better lol 
So ... Whoever called me several times around 5:20 as Private Caller ... What was that about ? lol 
:( RIP Obock Brahma . I guess you can't have an awesome name and survive in this world . 
RIP < PROPMALE > :\\ I've spent my entire life with you . I'm sorry your life ended somewhat disgracefully . I'm going to miss you . God , two pets in one week . :\\\\ 
There's only us , there's only this . Forget regrets or life is yours to miss . No other road , no other way . No day but today . 
Let's go out tonight . I have to go out tonight . You wanna prowl , be my night owl ? Well take my hand , we're gonna howl out tonight 
Man . Where the heck should I possibly apply to college ? I mean . I want to do law , or theatre , or film . All three require different schools . 
OH ! Right . I have that DVD , and then there's like a whole < PROPFEMALE > thing with more in my garage , lol 
I'm so proud of myself ! I'm in the 95th percentile of my class ;] ( That's good . lol ) 
Thanks career test . Really , I should be an actor ? Thanks . ( Note : Sarcasm ) 
Okay ... I hit the submit button for my classes . Two AP classes ( 3 AP tests ) buut then the rest are eassssssssy . 
Bread+olive oil in my lunch = the most ingenious thing ever . 
Uhm , you'll need to upload it to like Windows Movie Maker and then cut the piece out and resave it . 
I forgot about Cats Don't Dance ! Dude . I would like to sing Big and Loud please . Kthanx . 
I forgot to mention ! Yesterday was THE BEST Awkward Thursday I've had for a long time . Possibly the best ever . Thanks to everyone who made it awkward . Especially you , random chick who screamed \NICE UNDIES . \"" 
has the urge to perform over-the-top < PROPFIRST > in public . Who else is in ? 
So . What should I do for the rest of the night ? 
cannot find free sheet music for her audition song :\\ 
Man . I'm pooped ! Between garage sales , < PROPFEMALE>'s Sweet Sixteen ( Woot ! ) and the family BBQ , I'm surprised I'm still awake ! Aquarium or beach+headshots tomorrow ? :D 
Wants to kiss the world . :) Seriously , I haven't felt this good in a long long time . 
... Now what do I do ? I don't feel like studying for the World Hist test , and no way will I be doing math homework ... So writing my resume ? 
I wonder what people think of me when they see my Facebook . I hope it's good thoughts , haha . 
' Cause I've got one hand in my pocket , and the other one is giving a high-five . 
what the heck ? I was maybe going to take my headshots Saturday , but that didn't work . Maybe was going to Sunday , that didn't work . Was definitely going to take them today ... but it didn't work out ?! 
My brother was correcting a science worksheet in class , and instead of answering sepal ( the thing that protects the petals of a flower ) , he wrote soul patch because he was watching Apollo Ohno on T.V. I have taught him well . I love < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > . 
< PROPFIRST > Zachow and I performed Wicked : Abridged for < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > and Katarina Wagner . Best thing ever ! Next week : Act 2 . lol 
WHEW . My audition song breaks up into 32 bars pretty easily . Oh . Any idea if I'm a soprano/mezzo/alto ? Because I frankly have no idea . 
time to get ready for my headshots ... * yawn * 
my headshots turned out so adorable ! I forgot to upload them on my computer though . I'm going to go to my dad's house and play De Blob until I babysit :) Text me . 
I'm too lazy to type up a resume , since my old one has disappeared . I'm trying so hard not to freak out over everything , but it's not working too well . 
When life gets you down , play the life you want on The Sims . Works every time . Or you can ruin their lives , that helps , too . 
OMGOMGOMG . I'm psyching myself out . I can't do this audition . It's really difficult to get me nervous , but this does it . 
Happy Easter :) In true < PROPMALE > tradition , we're going to have breakfast and watch movies all morning ! < PROPFEMALE > and the Frog and Sherlock Holmes , anyone ? 
I request that EVERYONE texts me at least sometime this next week . Either a whole conversation , or just a simple * txts * . Kudos to those who send me a whole story . I love texts like that . 
doesn't want to sleep . But when I don't sleep , I get the bags under my eyes which I hate , and I'd rather not be tired for my audition tomorrow . 
GONNA PARTY LIKE IT'S 2012 ! And then go kick that audition's BUTT . YEAH . 
So , I failed my audition . Big surprise . But , I learned of something even better : auditions for A Chorus Line ! Now THAT'S something I have a real < PROPMALE > in , lol 
Off to Utah today ! :) I miss that place , even if it is less exciting than California . Be sure to text me ! 925-321-3772 
I've been flying to Utah about 3 times a year for 14 years , and this is the first time I've ever been anxious . What the heck ?! 
According to Wii Fit , I am currently healthier now , ( when I have no PE ) , than in November , when I had PE , and last June , when I ran even more than I did in November . Whaaaat ? 
Shopping today was a success ! :) Got these freaking adorable yellow shoes by Diesel ( LOVE THEM . ) and a bunch of make-up/hair stuff , and a tank top with a freaking * octopus * on it ! And the weather was like 55 degrees . WOAH . lol I actually took off my jacket . 
Can somebody please call my phone ? My brother took it and hid it somewhere downstairs ... Only I don't know where ... 
Goodbye everyone ! I'm moving to a cruise ship . Hopefully a Disney cruise ship . If I come to port in San < PROPFIRST > , I'll try to see all of you ! 
Okay , pretend you are a complete stranger to me . Now , look at my profile . Now ... What would you think of me ? lol 
Hm . I really don't want to go to sleep . But I need to if I want to get out of the house tomorrow ... 
I woke up at 7 , and I thought , why should I have to wake up this early ? So I went back to bed and slept until 9:15 :) Going to see Date Night today ! Text me ;) 
:) I love quilling . Totally time consuming , but so awesome . Oh , hey , I have a bazillion picture frames I need to fill , so friends , give me some pictures please ! Thanks . :) 
is going to the zoo :D Then , season opener Salt Lake Real game :) So excited , for everything . 
Off the the Real game ! Front row tickets ! :D I'll post pics . 
Back in Cali ! Thanks for all the notifications , guys : l Need to find some way to get through the day without screaming ... 
So , I'm pretty much the luckiest kid ever . I get my braces off in 9 days . That means I'll only have had them on for 10 months . Suck on that ! :D 
I haven't been on Facebook for a while ... Maybe I'm done with it ? 
Going to the city with < PROPFIRST > Zachow to find her senior ball dress ! She's gonna look < PROPFEMALE > hot , it'll turn < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > straight ;] 
So tired from waking up early and shopping with < PROPFIRST > Zachow . But I had so much fun ! Hopefully seeing Kick-Ass tonight with < PROPFIRST > McGuire . 
Kick-Ass = Amazing . That was a super good movie ! :D Being forced to go to an A's game today against my will :\\ Blech . 
is exhausted and feeling super sick . Maybe doing homework and Sims will help ? Oh . And I sat in the sun all day today , and I look even paler than before ! What the heck ?! 
Frye's homework please ? Thanks :) 
Needs another Arrested Development tee ! :) Frye's homework please ? Thanks ! 
Oh . What was the homework for Thompson's Alg 2 class ? It says < PROPFEMALE > 738 on School Loop ... But there are no problems on that < PROPFEMALE > ... lol 
I just rode my bike with my family while doing movie montage worthy choreography , while singing Do ( A Deer ) . Life is like a movie lol 
Just did Polar Express and Trees in my living room ... Man I miss dance so much . 
Happy birthday Elphie and Galinda ! :) Getting braces off tomorrow ! Oh . And if anyone doesn't have a 1st block and wants to < PROPFEMALE > out during the weird < PROPFEMALE > test schedule ... Let me know ! 
So , who else is psyched for Rent Act One : Abridged ? Katarina Wagner , are you prepared to BRING IT ?! How about < PROPFIRST > Zachow ?!! ( I call < PROPFIRST > ) 
OhMyGod . I cannot stop smiling . I look so amazing . :) I love not having braces . I look so different ! I'll post some pics after dinner :) 
I sound freaking stupid with my retainer . OMG . It's bad . 
I'm thinking about it ... Maybe I'll just do it later though . Like , next week . 
Bad News : I threw up . Good News : My retainer really is glow-in-the dark ! Bad News : I found out when I washed the vomit off of it . 
Not feeling too great . But it's okay . I'm going to put on my big girl panties and babysit and do my chores ! Text me :) 
I really want to do something today , before all my friends come over at 3 . But ... I'm stuck with a house full of crazy people who run around the house at 4:30 am . I wish I could just crawl back into bed ... 
Needs some pictures to decorate her room with . Time to search the internet ! 
Had a fun adventure with < PROPFIRST > McGuire and < PROPFEMALE > Sandoval . Except for the whole car fiasco . That was not so fun . Time to party all night with everyone else ! :) 
had an awesome night with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > Swiers , and < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ( I mean Sashley . Rofl ) Going shopping in Gilroy today :) Text it ! 
Don't make me go to school tomorrow . I won't do it ! 
I still get e-mails from Habbo ... Rofl . I delete them the second I see them , but still . It makes me miss the old days ... Kinda . 
I love my dad for getting me Pyzano's Pizza . This made my Monday . Oh . And < PROPMALE > has at least one friend . Thanks for whoever pretended to like my brother enough to make him a friendship bracelet ! 
really dislikes Wednesday's . Except for when Sami comes over after school and everyone does Wicked : Abridged and stuff . 
Having a rather lousy day . :( Raviolis and belting the Rent soundtrack will fix it though . Text it ! 
So . I've decided to maybe give up theatre and just stick with film for a while . Or maybe forever . IDK 
< PROPFEMALE > ALERT !!! Edmonton , KY little girl , 3 yrs old picked up by man driving grey car , license plate : Quebec 72B 381 . Put this as your status . It could save her . This kidnapping is recent so do it , 3 seconds will not kill you 
I wish everyday was a Friday . 
Going up to my aunt's cabin . Then , ( Insert Name Here ) Festival tomorrow ! I'm never quite sure of the actual name of the festival , since it changes EVERY YEAR . I just call it < PROPFEMALE > Wine Festival , just to be safe lol 
Okay . I'm home . So ... What do I do now ? OH . THAT'S RIGHT . SIMS . 
Ended my lazy Sims day early to < PROPFEMALE > out with < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > . Fun day . :) Some worthwhile quotes , as well , lol 
has a funny feeling about today ... :\\ 
A rather lousy day ... Except for the end . :) I get to be < PROPFEMALE > in 1984 on Thursday , May 20th ! I'm pretty excited . I know I can pull it all together in three weeks !! 
I'M SO ACEING THE HISTORY TEST . :) Bring ittttt . 
Here's a summary of my day : Kicked history's butt on that test today . Ready 1984 about 1984 times . I was pretty pissed since I had to stay at school all through lunch and first block since my lunch plans failed , but I was with < PROPFIRST > . Then I went to the mall with < PROPFIRST > , and all ended well when I bought three lipglosses I didn't need . 
So ... I fell asleep at like 8:45 pm . Wth ? I missed Glee ! D: 
is making a new email . I want something cute ... Like < PROPFIRST>'s \openingnight\ " . Suggestions please ? " 
:) I kinda like learning my lines . Even if it does mean me reading the script a kajillion times . I'm pretty good at memorizing , though ! 
Yet another night of forgetting to do my math homework . Time to take my pill and hope it will put me to sleep . Sleeping in for the first time in a week . :) 
The only reason I want to go to school is drama . Not looking forward to my academic classes ... :\\ 
OMG . I'm freaking myself out . What if I don't play < PROPFEMALE > the way the director wants ? And what if I can't memorize my blocking and lines ? Today was a disaster ! I HAVE to run lines 24/7 . I have to do everything humanly possible to get this right . 
FML ... Jordyn Wright , you won . I refuse to write my actor bio now . I finally wrote it , and I THOUGHT it printed ... But it didn't . And it didn't save . So now I just won't do it ! 
Excited to work on props today ! Found some suuuper cool props . Also . I need to spend less time with my brother . Every time we open our mouths , we say the exact same thing . It's scary . 
OH MAN . Thanks to everyone who posted something about their homework , because I completely forgot to do mine . 
Not super excited today . I have a Spanish test , which is going to be painfully easy , and a WWII test , which I will ace because I'm that awesome . And then I go home on time today , and go back to school at six and work on play stuff . In summary ... Eh . 
You know . Drama is my favorite part of my day . I get to just mess around and be myself , and everyone is there for a variation of the same reason : to perform . And you get so much done while having so much fun . There's hardly a bad thing about drama . 
OMG . Lullaby of Broadway is STUCKINMYHEAD . Getitout getitout getitout ! :\\ 
is so exhausted . Going back to school in an hour to do play stuff until 9:30 ish . Woohoo ! ... I'm so stressed and tired . :\\ And I don't have my make-up today . Just my make-up < PROPFEMALE > . Oh well . :) 
wants to blast her iPod and jump around and dance like a fool . :) 
I NEED A SILVER BOX , NOWW . Probably just wrapping an Orbit gum package in tin foil or spray painting or something lol 
I am so proud of everyone in 1984 :) I'd tag all of you , but then I would be here all night . And , when this play is over ... We need to exterminate Bobstein . :\\ 
GUESS WHO LEARNED ALL OF HER LINES IN LESS THAN TWO WEEKS ! So I was planning on just doing all of next week's homework this weekend . That was , until Frye assigned another timeline , plus a paragraph description of each event . Ohh boy . 
Good job to all in 1984 :) Be sure to see it Thursday , May 20th , that's when I'm < PROPFEMALE > :) If not , DEFINITELY see it that Friday or Saturday . It is a fantastic show ! Granada High Little Theatre , 7pm curtain . Be there ;] 
So ... I'm hungry . Anyone willing to bring me a cheese pizza and some chilled SmartWater please ? Thanks . :) 
Getting some exercise , hopefully running lines with Ceilidh , hopefully eating , Iron Man 2 , and next week's math homework . All shall be accomplished by 9:30 pm ! 
Look . I just don't want to do my homework . I don't want to do it this weekend , I won't want to do it next week , and I won't want to do it over the summer . Let's just accept it , and give me an A anyway because I know the material . 
A killer headache is not a pleasant start to my day . Doing Frye's timeline , and then babysitting for the rest of the afternoon/night . This may be one of my most productive weekends ever . 
What ? I did all of my homework for this weekend , plus tomorrow's homework , plus most of Tuesday's homework , plus I got three paragraphs done for the timeline ? This is insane ! 
Walked two < PROPMALE > with my hip hurting like crazy , then drove the rest of the way home . What do I do now ? 
SO MAD . I totally screwed up today :\\ And I left my script in the theatre . I'll just have to practice and hope I got it ... 
LOL I went upstairs to get a Band-Aid , and I ended up spending 30 minutes reahearsing in front of the mirror , then I went back downstairs to realize I still don't have that Band-Aid . 
I am soooooo pumped for 1984 tomorrow ! Thanks for everyone supporting me and thanks to those who put up with my incessant < PROPFEMALE > to practice :) Be sure to go to the show ! Tomorrow , 7pm , Granda Little Theatre . Hope to see you there ;) 
So ... I love you . 
I keep refreshing Facebook , hoping something else will happen so I'm distracted once more from doing my timeline ... 
Goodnight everyone :) Going to bed and then waking up as < PROPFEMALE > ! I don't think it works like that , but I'm going to try anyway . Be sure to see me tomorrow in 1984 :) ! 
Today is the day ! I couldn't sleep at all last night . I haven't been this nervous since I performed by myself at the < PROPFEMALE > and Wine Festival when I was 7 . Hopefully , Frye will let me rehearse 5th block . Hopefully . 
Getting into character is hardddd :\\ Be sure to see 1984 tonight ! 7 pm , Granada Little Theatre . Everyone has worked so hard :) It's such a good show ! 
And btw , thanks to mi madre for buying me a Save Ferris shirt :) Everyone should help raise money so Ferris can buy a new kidney ! Or ... something like that . 
Many thanks to EVERYONE who supported me tonight at my show :) I cannot thank you enough . I can never , ever , doubt myself again . Goodnight everyone , and once again , thank you :) 
:) Felt like a rockstar today . Even though it wasn't a terrific day . Had soooooo much fun going out with < PROPFIRST > Zachow !!!! Love that girl . Also had fun talking backstage . Haha . Goooood times . Thanks to the endless compliments you guys ! It means the world to me ! 
Nothing like starting your day with a little Hannibal and < PROPFEMALE > nail polish :) 
I don't have time to make videos ... But I have enough time to be bored . I need something to do please ? 
So , I have a question . Can < PROPMALE > Phantom have kids ? If so , would they be full ghost , half ghost , or part ghost ? And if they were half or part ghost , what powers would they have ? NICKELODEON MUST ANSWER MY QUESTIONS . 
:) Got new sheets for my bed . Excited . Decorating my walls today , since the bright < PROPFEMALE > is a < PROPMALE > overpowering . What should I put on my walls ? 
is going to have a Pizza My Heart picnic in the seating area of the Open Ocean exhibit at the Monterey Bay Aquarium :) Making up for my less-than-awesome mood yesterday . 
Absolutely did not sleep last night :\\ And didn't finish my math homework . Pushing through school anyway because I am a rockstar :D I already miss doing 1984 ... Kinda . 
cannot wait for the pills her mother ordered to come in the mail . I have found a way to enjoy today without going insane , at the very least :) 
had the weirdest dream last night . The US went through a proletariat revolution in like 2 days , only , it wasn't really by the proletariat , it was by the upper upper class , they just wanted it to seem like it was the proletariat's idea . And on the first day of class under their regime , I asked too many questions , so they sent me to the dungeons and fed me hay . Something is seriously wrong with my subconscious . 
is rather satisfied with life . 
Hey , can you do me a favor , please ? No more judging me , okay ? Thanks ! :) 
The thing that makes me laugh more than anything in the whole wide world : People who take themselves too seriously . How can you not laugh at that ? 
is getting her permit today ! :D I'm going to feel really stupid if I post this ... And then fail my test ... lol 
feels sick . But , I have to be at drama and history today . :\\ I'd rather not . 
Finally , some time alone in my house :) I can't wait for summer , when I can < PROPFEMALE > out with everyone all the time and make some movies for my portfolio ; > 
OMG . I just made myself a massive brownie sundae . Going to eat it , watch SYTYCD , and then go into a coma :) 
I have concluded Awkward Thursday to be a success today ! 
It's Friday ! You know , I'm never excited for the weekends anymore ? It's kinda sad . 
Had an absolutely amazing night ! :) Now time to go to the cabin , maybe swim up there , maybe go shopping , then back home tomorrow afternoon ! No cell service , so I'll talk to everyone laterr :) 
I am NOT enjoying being a loner tonight . :\\ No one is texting me , my cable is spazzing out , and I have nothing to do but math homework . Kill me now . 
GIVE ME SOMETHING TO DO . So bored , it makes me angry . Ugh . 
Happy Birthday , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ! Going to clean my room ( yikes ! ) then seeing < PROPMALE > of Persia . 
My steel drum band must cover Come on < PROPFEMALE > . How incredible would that be ?! 
My hands smell like waffle cones ... And no matter how much I wash them , they still have that smell ! I dunno why they smell like that , seeing as I really don't like waffle cones . 
So , I'm just trying to get a basic poll of people who are interested in having a day of hide and seek at the IKEA in Emeryville on either Saturday , June 12 , or Tuesday , June 14 . Please comment with your preferred date if you are interested . :) 
Is it weird that I'm excited for the AP summer homework ? Because I am really excited . I am just so really for my classes next year . :) 
Can I just say : I am totally amazed by how many celebrate Awkward Thursday . It just started as a little fun with my already awkward friends , and now it's a celebration ! :) I'm glad everyone enjoys being awkward . \ 
Now , if you like this status I will post on your \ 
wall something I like about you . Make this your status if you want a\ 
challenge :P 
So . Two things . One : My mom < PROPMALE > Roll'd me today at school . She sent me a text , and I thought it was about one thing , but really it was the < PROPMALE > Astley song . Made my day <3 \ 
Two : I love this thing where you tell everyone what you like about them . People can be so negative and just focus on that . But now people are focusing on the good , and that only multiplies the good by , like , a bazillion ! 
UGH . I don't have the < PROPFEMALE > to learn how to use Audacity . I just wanted to piece together some harmonies of A Walk Through Hell to make it at least somewhat presentable to Youtube . But ... That's not looking great for me right now . 
Don't even talk to me ... I am so exhausted ! And I have the variety show , babysitting , and then a cast party . Won't even be home till like 11 . UGH . 
So tired . I think I'm taking a temporary hiatus from Facebook , simply because I am so exhausted . If you really want to reach me , I'll be in bed most of the day tomorrow with my phone and my handy-dandy movie collection , so call/text me if you need to ... 
Ahhhhh . How should I get my hair cut ? Just a trim ? IDK ! 
Luckiest girl in the world ? I think so ! Not only did I win Wicked lotto Thursday , I won Lady Gaga tickets today , and I manifested myself some donuts . I am so awesome . And humble . 
Exhausted . But I don't really want to sleep . At all . I want to dance and chat . Going to the Sunset Festival tomorrow in Menlo Park ! YAY ! 
Woohoo . Walking home in flip-flops carrying my APUSH book , Spanish book , yearbook , plus all my school crap , plus the War is Peace posters was an awful idea . Ouch . Someone actually yelled \I'm sorry\ " to me from their car lol . " 
Be careful what you wish for ... It just might come true ! 
I can now legally drive with a liscenced driver of 25 or older ! Dude . I drove part of the way home , and let me just say ... I drove better before I had my permit . Haha . I feel really bad ! 
Drove home today . MUCH more sueccessful than the driving fiasco of yesterday . Even drove on S Livermore , which scares me to DEATH . But I guess all the other drivers knew that , because no one was on it when I turned :) 
Feeling a little off today :\\ The Sims shall cure that though ! 
Why is my favorite family on the Sims at my mom's house ? I was saving my game because I know how my mom's computer loves to crash on me , and of course , it crashed just as I was saving . This family is never getting anywhere ! 
All you are to me is dead skin , flaking off my hand onto the pavement . 
Summer will be great ! Kick off with lunch with < PROPFEMALE > Bean , < PROPFEMALE > Bean- < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > Zachow ! Then < PROPFIRST > and I went to the mall , where we had LOADS of fun , and then I went to < PROPMALE>'s soccer game ! :) Now I just need to find some time to be crazy with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > and Katarina Wagner ! P.S. I hate you , Katarina . 
Woke up to my mom and brother screaming at the TV . Must be the World Cup <3 Excited to do a fashion photoshoot for < PROPFEMALE > Tripp's lookbook ! :D :D :D Teaparty+picnic included . 
To the grads ( especially my dear < PROPFIRST > Zachow ) Congrats on graduating ! You all worked so hard , and you guys have such exciting futures ahead of you ! Wish I was at your graduation ! And , good luck to you all :) 
Bummed my filming plans fell through :( Going to watch the World Cup instead , though . Woohoo ! :D This summer is looking to be pretty awesome still , lol I just need to find some time to < PROPFEMALE > out with my friends more . Especially Katarina and < PROPFIRST > and Sami and all of my friends that I didn't < PROPFEMALE > out with in the last few months of school :(( 
Tie 1-1 ! The US goal was so baaaaad haha . But , whatever , I'll take whatever goals we can get . But I'm so embarrassed for the Brits . C'mon Green , you have to feel stupid for letting that one go in ! 
So bored ! It's either clean the garage so I can dance , clean my room so I can put in the new computer , or work out . Hmmmmm . 
Okay . I don't enjoy being home alone anymore . Anyone want to call me and chat ? 
BEACHBEACHBEACHBEACH ! Please ? Playing some old school Roller Coaster Tycoon , getting rid of the refridgerator ( in the dump , not my yard . I'm not white trash . ) Then , hopefully going to the beach , or the city . :) 
Just got back from the beach <3 I love it , even if it does turn me blonde . Now eating Chinese food , setting up the new comp , and recording the Tonys :) ! 
I feel like such a computer pro when I try to install the Sims 2 . lol I dunno why it won't work flawlessly , though . I have so many blank CDs with downloaded patches and back-up disks just so I can install it ... 
Finally found time to read Without You ( sorry < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > . I'll be done soon ! ) Just got to the part where < PROPMALE > dies , and I'm bawling ! I mean , I knew when it was going to happen , but still . What a talented guy . He was ... a prophet or something . And jesus , guys , I'm in a book for his family ! 
< PROPMALE > out downtown and then dyed my hair with < PROPFIRST > Zachow ! We're both lovely , dark-haired beauties now :) 
WHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT TO INSTALL THE SIMS 2 ?! I might as well just wait and install the Sims 3 . 
So fixed all my other Sims 2 problems ... Except for when I transfer the compressed file on Disk 4 , it says there's an error of the cyclic redundancy check . And cleaning the disk isn't fixing it , so I either buy a discounted disk 4 , or just forget the Sims 2 . I like the last idea . 
We never get out of the house before noon in Utah ... 
I love the gumball machines that dispense moustaches . <3 
Man , it's exhausting to keep up with my friends ' sleep schedules haha . I hope they know that I risk my health to talk to them ! :P 
If everyone can work just a LITTLE harder to get out of the house , we might actually be able to go see the chalk < PROPMALE > festival at the Gateway . LET'S GOOOOOO . 
Well , since I was the only one in my family who really wanted to do stuff ... How about you text me while they go and be lazy ? 
Jealous of everyone going to YATC <3 Also , happy Fathers ' Day < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ! Wish I was with you ! I love and miss you lots ! 
Haha my family is so crazy . I love them for it <3 Got some pretty good quotes from this weekend , too . Haha ;] 
So . Since I've been so attached to my phone lately , I decided not to text anyone for the rest of the day . ( Let's see how long this lasts . Especially since I'm not doing anything today , and I'm stuck in Utah ) Talk to you all tomorrow ! :) 
is in a funk . Shopping didn't alleviate the icky feelings . And finishing Without You REALLY didn't help , haha . And then my family threw out the chocolate cake , and my grandparents don't have a VCR . So ... What do I do ? 
So , I'm thinking IKEA scavenger hunt the last week of July . Like or comment if you're game . Jordyn Wright , let's make a list of things when you get back ! :D Katarina Wagner , aren't you PSYCHED ?! haha . 
Back in California :) So , explain to me why I am having nightmares about the first day of next year ... when we're only two weeks into summer . It might be some part of me trying to get me to finish my AP homework early . But I won't let it succeed ! ;) 
I'm thinking Vine to watch the World Cup ? :D Then , back to working with my impossible computer to make it slightly useful . 
Ugh . Bored . And my computer is so freaking slow , so I refuse to use it until it decides to be faster . Anyone wanna < PROPFEMALE > out , chat , whatever ? 
Ugh . I wanna make a quick video/vlog thing , but I have no idea what to do ! Creative blocks are the worst . 
Hurray :) After two weeks of having nightmares every night , I didn't have one last night ! I think that means today will be a good day . Also , finally came up with a fantastic idea for a screenplay . Cannot wait to finish it :) 
I WAS going to make a ringtone of < PROPMALE > Rogen's laugh ... But I decided that might be a little too creepy . 
I feel like doing some designing . I might be redesigning my bathroom this summer , if < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > and I can agree on something lol . I'm thinking something fresh . Like , apple green and a fog grey color scheme , with super a super light wood for the cabinets . Dunno if < PROPMALE > is totally digging that , though , haha . 
Great idea for a screenplay ... But I just never get around to writing . I am determined to finish it before the end of summer , though !! 
Exhausted . I need to wash my shoes so I can paint and sew buttons onto them , and I need to perfect Sami's birthday gift . Hmmmm ... 
Hanging out with Sami-Sue today :) For the first time this summer , too ! 
Any movies that I absolutely have to see ? I'm trying to check everything off of the list lol 
If I'm going to have so much free time , I should really remember my webcam because I have nothing to do ... :\\ 
Going to < PROPFEMALE > out with my dear < PROPFIRST > Zachow on her 18th birthday :) Then celebrating < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE>'s 16th later tonight . Happy birthday to my besties ;] 
Excited for the annual 4th of July party tomorrow :) I miss seeing everyone !! 
Day is not off to a good start ... It will get better though , once my friends get here ! I hope to see everyone at Robertson Park tonight ;) 
I will NOT be staying up until 4:30 again for a very long time . I took a nap , but that only seemed to make things worse lol All I want to do is sleep ... 
Playing < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > on the Wii :) I am so addicted to those games . 
Maybe going to see the Germany vs Spain game at the Vine . If not , I'll probably be reading at Strizzis today . 
is craving some Pyzano's Pizza . Oh well . Gay Nineties will just have to do . 
People can be so confusing sometimes ! 
Text/Talk to me today ! Just packing and playing < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > and babysitting , so not much is going on haha . 
:) Home from Yosemite ! What an incredibly fun trip ! < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > and I had so much fun in the freezing cold water , and hiking up Mist Trail :) Glad to be home , though . Pictures are going up soon ! 
Nintendo 64 Nostalgia Day . This Saturday . My house . 4:30 - 7:30 . Everyone is invited ! Bring controllers if you want because mine kinda suck haha . I have a lot of games , but bring some if you want :) 
So today , I'm going to finish watching Shop Girl , then make a vlog , and then ... do nothing . Hurray for lazy days :) ! 
Hm ... What Say Anything song should I make a ringtone out of ? I might just try out a few of them and see . 
Ugh . Kinda sorta really mad . :\\ 
Ohhh , people can be so funny sometimes . 
Woke up in a bad mood . I'll just release my anger destroying the bathroom today :) It's going to look so amazing when we're done !! 
Feeling slightly better . Even though I can't get my beloved Tetris bath and wall set , and my brother completely threw out my idea of green accents , I'm moving on :) 
Tired , bored , and I feel like I should be creative , but I would really rather not . What is there to do , then ? 
I wish my dreams were real . My good dreams , anyway . 
2,665 views on one of my YouTube videos :) ! 2,515 on another , and 1,789 on yet another . Yeah . I'm good . Haha . 
\The awesome thing about Facebook is that you can quote \ 
Wow . My chicken just sneezed . And then I said bless you . lol 
is exhausted ! Had so much fun playing Ultimate and making funny faces at the people in the McDonald's drive-thru , rofl ;] Going to bed , and hopefully making a video tomorrow . 
Cutting out pics for my walls tonight . Excitedddddd for N64 party tomorrow :) ! 
Wow , so I guess I'm back to the weird dreams . In this one , the capitalists decided to have a nuclear war and wipe out as much as they can , and then reteach those who survived that the capitalists were the best , and they tried to make doctors the ruling class . This one could make a good screenplay , actually . 
Excited to have people over and play some N64 :) I will own everrrrrryone at Pokemon Stadium ! haha . 
:) Going to the aquarium . Lovelovelovelovelove it ! I'm so excited !!!! 
Not going to be a good day today ... I feel like just laying in bed all day and watching sappy movies . Anyone wanna join me ? 
I already hear the calls of the < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Beach Boardwalk :) Tomorrow is going to be soooooo much fun ! I'm ditching the yearbook idea , might just follow random people until they notice . Haha . 
I'm angry at < PROPFIRST > Zachow for making me do ANOTHER audition ! D: 
SantaCruzSantaCruzSantaCruz <3 
Wicked Abridged today ? I think so ! lol Man . I am sooooo tired . This insomnia needs to stop . Maybe I should also stop talking on the phone . Haha . 
Wicked Abridged might be the coolest thing ever :) 
Next on Is it Retarded ... Is < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > retarded ? 
Bored out of my mind D: I need to do something besides look at audition songs ... 
There is nothing more soothing to the soul than a trip to the mall :) Excited to < PROPFEMALE > out with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , maybe even < PROPFIRST > Zachow ! 
Can't decide if I want to look nice today or not . Hmmm ... 
Home alone for once ! Making Oreo pie , blasting my music , and playing some much needed Sims . Because that's what I do when I'm home alone . lol 
I'd be happy to die for a taste of what Angel had . Someone to live for , unafraid to say I love you . 
All right . It's midnight , and I have run out of things to do . Guess I'll just go to bed . Haha . Goodnight :) 
Making homemade cinnamon rolls with my daddy :) I enjoy not having my brother around . 
So , I plan on finishing this < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > game today , because it is the most complicated one ever , and I have started it 5 different times , but never finished . This time , though , I will ! 
Haha I loaded the second batch of cinnamon rolls with so much cinnamon that it's oozing out and bubbling in the oven . Yummm :) 
And now I'm bored . Suggestions of things to do ? 
Kinda in a bad mood . I need to find something to do today that'll relieve me from my icky feelings . 
I need someone to live like next door to me . Or , I need to move back to my house on Second St. Or maybe I should just walk downtown by myself , like my original plan . Hm . 
Wow . My wireless router is so incredibly annoying . It likes to just shut off randomly , and it makes uploading videos more difficult than it should be . 
I didn't know it was even possible , but I have managed to make a batch of brownies even better than the last . Yummmm :) 
Hanging out downtown today :) I'm kinda enjoying this cloudy weather . Wish it would rain ... 
Ahhh I want to do something today . I did babysit , but that's done , so now what do I do ?! 
HAPPY TMI TUESDAY ! :D 
I want to do something today besides tearing out my bathroom . :\\ 
Last night I had a dream that < PROPFEMALE > the Explorer was an illegal immigrant . They even showed footage on the news of her pole-vualting the\ 
border fence . My subconcious is stranger than I thought . MLIA 
I can't wait for our bathroom to be done :) It's coming along slowly , but it is so worth it . No more scary bathroom ! Haha . 
So not only did I spill the primer , get most of it on me , and let it dry so it is nearly impossible to get off , then < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE>'s , the pizza I always eat to make things better , is closed ! D: NOOOOOOO . 
I absolutely do not want to do my AP homework , and that is that . 
So for the first night in three weeks , I actually slept . For 11 hours ! It was amazing ! I guess that's what happens when you take sleeping pills , use aromatherapy , and do absolutely everything recommended to help you sleep . And I also had some super weird , insane dreams . Oh well . At least I slept . 
I miss < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > :( Together , we will find out who in the world is sabotaging the Sims and we will take . them . down . 
Ugh feel like I'm going to throw up :( 
So ... Much ... Texting ... lol . Even for me . 
Couldn't sleep at all because I felt sick :\\ Hopefully haircut and hanging out and babysitting will make everything better ... 
Would having an ice cream sundae for breakfast be wrong ? 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is my best friend in the whole wide world . And I love her and thank her for talking to me . lol 
This isn't cool . I didn't ask to be sick . Feels like I ate a truckload of steak , milk , and onions . ( All things I'm allergic to , if you didn't know ) Gonna go babysit and hope I don't throw up ! 
No hanging with < PROPFEMALE > tomorrow :( Oh well . We'll Skype our zombie movie :) 
My life is pretty messed up . Sigh . :\\ 
OMG . \At least < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > died the way he lived ... With animals in his heart \"" 
Gonna be honest , it kills me inside knowing I can't see Rent this weekend at the Hollywood Bowl . I don't care if I don't like most of the cast members , it's Rent , and it's going to be phenomenal . 
I need to make a video within the next hour ... What of ? :\\ 
Camping at < PROPFEMALE > for the weekend . No friends , so I guess I'll use that time to do AP homework ... Text me ? 
Camping :\\ 
This must be what other people feel like . 
Forget my last post . Other people don't feel the same lol . I love Katarina Wagner . And you know what ? I still know all of my lines to 1984 . And I know this , because I had a dream last night , and it was the entire play . And then I checked how accurate it was to my script . My mind amazes me . 
OHMYLORD . Just watched some vids of Rent at the Hollywood Bowl ... Didn't know it was possible to do that awful of a job as < PROPFEMALE > . Wow . 
Great Mall today :) Hopefully I won't pass out from exhaustion ! 
Not quite sure what I'm doing today ... < PROPMALE > is going to the Pixar museum , but I thought we were working on the bathroom today , so ... 
Camping again :\\ This time at Big Basin . BUT , I'll be going to the boardwalk , UC < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > , and downtown so it's okay :) Even if I will be all dirty haha . Be sure to text me ! 
Back from camping ! Thank goodness . Now just need to finish homework and figure out what to do for pictures . Hmmmm . 
Couldn't sleep , though for the short time I managed to , I had this amazing dream about this mom who had rage issues and would get so worked up she would kill whoever made her mad . Honestly , it would make a fantastic movie , if I ever got around to writing the script lol . 
Going to the movies :) Then babysitting ! Yay ! 
Agh , my headache is lasting way too long :\\ Going to do school stuff tomorrow . Hurray ? lol I'm excited to get my schedule , though :) 
Don't feel so good :( Gotta feel better so I can do my AP homework ! 6 more days to finish Grapes of Wrath , Crucible , and write 93 more note cards . I can do it ! haha 
First trimester is gonna suck :\\ Like my teachers , though . 1 ) Biotech- Lopez 2 ) Spanish 3- Grobmeier 3 ) Stats- Avilla 4 ) AP English- Heagle 5 ) APUSH- Mariotti 
So even though I deleted like 30 odd photos of myself off of Facebook yesterday , I took some more today . It's like an addiction haha . 
Going to make chocolate chip pancakes for breakfast , something involving < PROPMALE > or marinara for lunch , and brownies somewhere in between . And I am going to do all of my Grapes of Wrath journal . Wish me luck ! haha 
OMG I HAVE AN AUDITION IN 10 DAYS AND I FORGOT AND I NEED TO FIND AN AUDITION SONG . Can't wait to see how I screw it up this time ... 
Got nothing done today that I meant to . Ughhhhhhhhh . 
I was trying to sleep off my migraine , and my mother puts one of my fake mustaches on me and takes a picture . Thanks , mom . 
My dad is taking me away so I can do my AP homework , and I may or may not get cell service . On an unrelated note , I had another communist dream last night :) I just wish I knew what it meant ! lol 
You know that song Ironic by Alanis Morissette ? It isn't ironic at all . Isn't that ironic ? 
Only 40 more notecards for APUSH , and 11 more quotes for AP Eng . I am the poster child for procrastination . 
Eight quotes per novel seems a little excessive , don't you think ? Especially when one is like 130 pages long . 
OMG ONE PACK . I hate you Katarina . Always and forever . :) 
School gives me a headache . I want to like it , I do , but there's nothing to be excited about yet :( 
I am going to turn this day into a fantastic one by doing my homework on my bed while watching a movie and eating a brownie sundae . :) Gotta love life . 
I know I should start my essay . I should really start it since I didn't even read the book entirely , and I only have 5 quotes . And since the essay is due Friday . I don't have anything to inspire me , though ! So maybe I'll just wait until Thursday . I always find my best inspiration at midnight . 
I need help for an idea of a simple observational study I can do for Stats . The best I came up with is counting how many girls wash their hands after using the restroom during like lunch . As enlightening as that would be , I would rather not do that . Any suggestions ? 
I need a chiropractor appointment stat . My hips are pretty messed up at the moment . If you see me waddling , that's why , lol . 
Came up with a great thesis for my essay . I just need to reread the book to tag better quotes :( 
Anyone want to do my homework and write my essay for me ? ;) I'd really appreciate it . Oooh , or maybe cure my insomnia . In fact , I'd rather have that . 
Burn Notice has had , what , 3 or 4 seasons now ? And it's the 7th rated show on cable . Yet , I had no idea what it was about until today . Does anyone else not know what it's about , or at least didn't ? 
Sympathize with me here . It's the first week of school , I have a lab , a project , and an essay . Another family is moving into my house . I am currently kneeling on the ground , typing my essay , because there's not enough room to fit a chair in at the moment . Oh , and my stomach is currently rebelling against me . The weekend cannot come any sooner . 
Homework :\\ And sooooo much of it . Ugh . So I probably won't be on for the rest of today , or tomorrow , because I'm pretty sure I'm babysitting from 3 to 9 . 
Blech , not feeling too great . Going to the movies , then going to do all of my homework :) Haha . I'm not really sure what to do about that English thesis . Sigh . 
It's Monday already ? Blech . Not ready for school . At least it's Lumberjack Monday ;) 
I should probably stop eating my year-old Pez that tastes kinda like perfume . 
In a funny mood . Hm . Oh , and my computer at my dad's house is in the garage , so I have to be really motivated to want to go on haha . And happy TMI Tuesday everyone ;] 
For 24 hours you can ask me 1 question [ only in my inbox ] I will answer\ 
it no matter what . You have my full honesty . I dare you to put this in \ 
your status and see what people ask you ... 
Sooooo tired . Gonna enjoy some time alone , then do homework , then plan for this murder mystery thing I volunteered for . Definitely text me , please ! 
I really don't want to go to my cabin . I would much rather be in a coma all weekend , because I am pretty sure that's the only way I can get some sleep . 
I think I'm sick :\\ Cabin wasn't so much fun . At least I get to make up for it by babysitting and doing homework and getting ready for tomorrow . Yay ? I feel like I wasted my weekend . 
My life is a < PROPFIRST > Hughes movie waiting to be made . 
Insomnia needs to go away . I'm not wearing any cover up today so everyone can see the incredible dark circles I have no way of getting rid of . 
Witty status that will make everybody that I feel like talking to comment . 
:) Today HAS to be a good day because I slept last night for the first time in three weeks . I am so happy :) 
Where do I begin ? Hmmmmm . Well , what a fantastically Awkward Thursday :) 
Kinda sorta confused ? 
Maybe I should've done the in-class essay in class . Hmmmmm . 
Definitely writing a paper ( book ? essay ? article ? ) on what the movies has taught me . What Dirty Dancing has taught me : When I find the right guy , I will run across the room and he will lift me and everyone will dance around us . It can happen . 
Looooong day yesterday , with a happy ending . Another long day ahead of me , but I'm excited . Text me ! 
Ugh . FML much ? 
Made $120 this weekend . :) Unfortunately , this week is going to be a long one . And it's only Sunday . Sigh . 
I was reading the rules for this sweepstakes thing , and this is a line taken from the rules : \Canadian winners will be required to correctly answer a mathematical \ 
It's only Sunday , and it's already a horrible week . I wish it was the weekend again , lol . Oh well , maybe painting my nails and watching some 80s movie will help . If not , you texting me will ! ;) 
Today is going to be swell , right ? :) At least Mercury is out of retrograde ! 
Who has two thumbs and totally rocks at school ? I do ! I have aced both of my APUSH tests so far , and I aced my math test , and I am in like a bazillion clubs . :) I am doing soooooo well . 
Thank you very much < PROPMALE > Meyer for totally making my day and making me smile like crazy . Haha . 
Happy TMI Tuesday ! I have worn a see-through shirt all day . Can that count as TMI ? haha ;) 
I'm all excited over nothing right now , haha . This week is pretty awful , but I'm still kinda happy and stuff . Weird . First behind the wheel tomorrow ( should've gotten that done months ago , haha ) . Ahhhh , just give me something good to look forward to , please . 
I really want to do something fun right now . Any suggestions ? Oh , and first behind the wheel tonight ! :) 
Put my iTunes on shuffle , and Every Little Piece from the < PROPMALE>'s Dragon soundtrack came up . Nothing could put a bigger smile on my face . Just ... ohmygoodness :) 
Something about fall puts me in a Say Anything mood . Hmm . 
I'm surprised I haven't gotten sick , considering how often I undercook things , lol 
Essay :\\ Feel free to talk to me , lol 
Revenues from a stupid YouTube video I made ? Sign me up ! 
Why the hell can't I give effective commentary in my essay ? Ughhh . Sorry to whoever edits this . 
I kinda have a huge crush on < PROPMALE > Saunders . Too bad he was my age in the 40s . Oh , and he's fictional . 
I should sleep so I can rest up for babysitting tomorrow . But ... My bed is so far away from my computer ... 
I got home at 9:30 last night . :\\ Such an exhausting day ! Going to relax and < PROPFEMALE > out with < PROPMALE > ! :D 
Don't distract me . I'm writing my essay . 
I don't know how to open my essay ( seems like I should've done this a long time ago , but I do introductions last , lol ) . I want to use a quote , but the only quote I like has an anonymous author , which doesn't seem right to use in an essay . 
< PROPFEMALE > Whitman , I blame you for all that is bad in my life . 
has to do all of her homework this week , so probably no Ultimate ... Again . Will probably do something creative , though ! :D 
Witty status that makes everyone I want to talk to comment . ( I'm getting a little lazy . haha ) 
Once I finish my homework , maybe some Skype , I think I'll bake something . Or paint my nails or something involving cutting out magazines . Hmmmm . 
So exhausted :\\ I hate not sleeping . Maybe I'll bring a blanket to school and just sleep in all my classes ... 
How I'm spending the rest of the day : building a nest of pillows and blankets in bed , with my grilled cheese and Top Ramen , watching TV . :) OMG GLEE ! 
Lunch with < PROPFIRST > Zachow tomorrow ! Something to look forward to ! Maybe hanging out with < PROPMALE > Meyer ? It would make for one incredibly awesome day :)) 
So so so bummed that my lunch plans fell through :( And my Sweet Tomatoes coupon expires today ! Ugggh . Gonna go dance it out ... 
I sometimes wonder if < PROPFIRST > Hughes is bored in the after life and is directing my life as like his final work . And then I realize that if < PROPFIRST > Hughes was really directing my life , he wouldn't give me so much homework . 
I have decided on a Halloween costume : < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > will dress up as Link , and I will dress up in all black with glow sticks on my head , and I will be Naavi . Hey ! Listen ! lol 
My beautiful bathroom is now complete ! :) ! And , I just bought a new skirt , and I will look so incredibly amazing tomorrow ! :D ! So excited . 
Everyone , go enjoy the day , because this is the only September 24th , 2010 , that you have . 
Not a bad day :) Hopefully tomorrow will be even better ! If I can clean my room and get all of my homework done . :) Good good mood . 
Gonna make some < PROPMALE > n cheese :) Hopefully this box won't be nine years expired ... 
Uh-oh ... I'm feeling like spending an obscene amount of money ... 
is so crazy about < PROPMALE > Meyer . Thanks for being like , the coolest boyfriend ever . Glad we watched The Office together :) 
Short week for me :) Exciteeeeeed . Not excited for make-up work , though . Gonna go pretend I studied for my history test :) 
Did not get more than a minute of sleep last night . And there's a Unite 4 Life assembly . I actually got my mom to sign the form saying she doesn't want me to go , but I guess you had to turn it in Friday :\\ At least classes are shorter ... 
Gonna do my history homework , think about going to Ultimate , and probably avoid people . And try my best to get some sleep ! 
Wow . How quickly a surprisingly passive day can turn into an awful one . :( 
Shiksa ( Girlfriend ) :) 
Wish I got to spend more time with < PROPMALE > . Oh well . Gonna suck it up and make an excursion to IKEA or something . 
May be the best girlfriend ever :) ! 
See you all Monday :) Text me ! 
Loving Newport Beach :) Had breakfast on the beach , now going to Fashion Island to do some much needed shopping ! I hope I brought enough money ! haha . 
Going to do all of my homework in the car today ... Also , need to go to the mall this week , anyone care to join ? 
Home :) Tengo que terminar mi tarea . Hablenme por favor ! 
Gonna do my homework and pretend it's storming outside . Feel free to participate , lol 
I forgot how much I like \Losing My Religion\ " . Thanks Glee :) " 
Even though we ain't got money , I'm so in love with you < PROPFEMALE > , and everything will bring a chain of love . 
Let's hope the rest of the day turns around . Pleasepleaseplease ? 
:) 
I guess it's a good thing I learned to swallow pills on Monday . 
It feels like my brain is one of those toys you stick in water for three days and expand , but it's trying to expand beyond the limitations of my skull . So , can anyone help me come up with something to illustrate for my journal ? I need some sort of idea , like home or love or something . 
Procrastination is an < PROPMALE > form that shouldn't be rushed . 
I'm fairly sure this isn't an illustration , but whoever gets to grade my paper is in for a real treat ;) 
So it's official . I have the best boyfriend ever . :) 
Wish I slept more ... Kinda nervous for Ultimate today . I haven't gone to a practice all year ( oops ) and I definitely haven't worked out for a verrrrry long time . I'm predicting mucho pain for me these next three weeks . But you know what ? It'll be worth it :) 
Had so much fun at < PROPFEMALE>'s party last night :) Pictures will be up soon ! Going to < PROPFEMALE > out with the family today and fit in homework at some point :\\ 
Really looking forward to Sami coming over and baking brownies , cookies , and finishing with some ice cream :) Yesssss 
I don't feel so great , and I have a bunchhhhh of homework , and I guess I'm going to college planning night . Hope I won't be too exhausted to go to the mall with < PROPMALE > tomorrow ! 
Please help me get rid of this icky feeling plaguing me :\\ 
So tired of the indecisiveness ! Sure , that's hypocritical , but I have a pretty good reason for being indecisive . And hey , at least I have a reason ! ( < PROPMALE > Meyer , yeah , this is kinda about you , haha ;] ) 
:) Feeling so good . 
Gonna watch some TV and eat a brownie cookie sundae after hanging out with < PROPMALE > . :) I don't know if you know this , but < PROPMALE > is the best thing ever . 
I neeeeed to do all of my homework so I can go to Casablanca tonight , but I also have a doctor appt :\\ Not enough hours in a day ... 
Casablanca :) I'm treating myself since I got two shots today . 
:( I want a weekend to myself . 
I need to : Go to the mall , do homework , go to the movies , and pumpkin patch . Can I do it all ? :\\ I hope so ! 
I'm getting two pufferfish for my birthday . OMGOMGOMG . I need to think of names for them . Goodness , I am so excited . 
Thanks to everyone who sent me birthday wishes :) First voice lesson today . Let's hope I can stay awake ! lol 
Now how to end this essay ? :\\ 
:( Not in a good mood . But , there's the fail-proof way to cure it : dancing :) haha . 
Well . I guess I go to bed now ? I really hope this weekend is a good one . Starting it out with some Pirates is a good sign , though . 
Planning on baking with lots of chocolate today :) I'm so excited ! 
Baked with chocolate for like 6 hours straight . Now I have to do homework so I can go to IKEA tomorrow . Sooooo exhausted ! 
And then they made me their chief . 
Question , for the classification journals , do you have to use two of each of the things listed , or just two from the list ? It may be a really stupid question , but just work with me . 
I'll blame this weird , pseudo-emo mood to Catcher in the Rye . Thanks , Holden , for passing onto me the loathing of goddamn phonies . 
Super bummed < PROPFIRST > Zachow can't make my party :( Oh well . It'll still be a fun weekend . 
Epiphany ! But , it isn't fully realized yet . I have a large part , though , lol 
Might have to settle as dressing up as < PROPFIRST > Lohan in jail for Halloween . Unless I can find something more clever . On the bright side , < PROPMALE>'s Link costume looks pretty awesome :) 
Mariotti gave me 190% on a test , guys ! Haha I guess I'll be a good person and let him know of his mistake ... 
Oh , apparently Limewire is illegal ? Need to find some way to download my music without paying $1 for every song ... :\\ 
Cannot stop listening to Chia-Like , I Shall Grow . < PROPMALE > Bemis is the love of my life <3 
Figured out my costume ! I'm going to be the BP oil spill ! :) 
Alright , time to party :) Can't wait . We got the slushee machine going , I just made brownies and rice krispies , and the chocolate fountain is ready ! And when it gets dark ... Murder , Murder !! 
Exhausted . Just spent like an hour fixing my computer . Now gonna go see Paranormal Activity ( hopefully ) and then try to pull together a censored streaker costume . 
Okay . I am so upset I didn't see Say Anything . Seriously considering flying out to see them somewhere this next week . :\\\\\\ 
And even if your whisper eats my ear , your voice shall be the only song I long to hear . And even if you fear the end , our sacrament of salmon and < PROPFEMALE > beer will still be here . 
Every time I read Catcher in the Rye , my heart breaks a little more . 
Loooong day , and my tummy hurts , and it's going to be a long weekend , and I just need some rest , and I would really like to see < PROPMALE > , because Sunday is like ages away . 
Getting Sushi and Dim Sum , then dying my hair and playing Apples to Apples with some apple peach sparkling cider :) Great night . 
I like smelling like < PROPMALE > . 
Even though it's a three day week , and I have Disneyland to look forward to Wednesday night , I still can't bring myself to go to school . :\\ 
I already did all of my homework ... I guess I'll paint my nails Melon of < PROPFIRST > ( I love OPI haha ) and do next week's homework while watching Back to the Future ? 
WTF Glee ? Woahhhhh . 
Hanging out with < PROPFIRST > Zachow today ! Also , this will probably be my last post until Monday , because I'm leaving for Disneyland tonight :) So excited ! 
Loving Disneyland :) I'm so tempted to buy a < PROPMALE > the Frog hat . Haha except I can't remember where I put my money ... 
Ugh . Really . Can you stop being an asshole and stop pissing me off ? I would really appreciate it . 
I'd walk through hell for you , let it burn right through my shoes , these soles are useless without you . 
So , like a month ago , I started voice lessons . And you know what ? I love it . :) I have a blast singing . 
Oh man . I just screwed up those brownies like no other . What an embarrassment . Also , can't find anything to wear tomorrow . Ahhhhhh . 
One less < PROPFEMALE > to answer , one less egg to fry , one less man to pick up after , no more laughter , no more love . 
Okay , I'll study for history , only because I didn't read the chapters , don't know some of the stuff , and I left my history book at my mom's house . and I only have a 92% . 
Oh jesus christ . My cat jumped up on my chair behind me , her fur brushing the exposed skin on the small of my back , and a sudden chill came over me . I swear she is satan's messenger . :\\ 
Oh yeah . No 1st , 2 : Biotech , 3 : APUSH , 4 : AP Eng , 5 Adv . Theatre :) Any classes ? 
Resist temptation ... 
What a fine mess you've made yourself . \ 
Also , I had to turn down a free ticket to the < PROPMALE > Potter premiere tonight because my dad doesn't want me to be tired for my finals tomorrow . \ 
Too bad I'm an insomniac , and I'll be spending the night reciting all of the Order of the Phoenix in my head ( because that's the only one I know by heart ) 
< PROPFIRST > gave the extra ticket to my brother :( I'm gonna cry . 
I AM DONE . 
I babysit at 3:30 , but I have nothing to do until then , or a ride . What in the world do I do ?! 
Oh boy do I need a break . Babysitting for 6 hours is way too long ! 
Tomorrow better make up for these crappy past few weeks . Or else . And yeah , that is a threat . 
Getting my Lady Gaga tickets in the next couple of weeks :) \ 
Sooooooo excited ! 
Can't decide what to make today . Brownies , of course ( this time , WITH eggs , ) but no idea what to make for lunch ! 
I finally got around to putting up all my photos ... \ 
Ohhhhh boy . 
Bought two cute jackets to protect me from the 22 degree weather in Utah :) I'm actually pretty excited . Though I really prefer California . And all of you guys who live here . 
And I'm off for Utah . Please feel free to text me :) I can't wait to take lots of pictures of the snowy mountains , and cuddle up next to the fire with my family , maybe do some quilling , maybe play some Super < PROPFIRST > Wii with my brother ;) 
Going to mess around with my hair and stuff , then going to Urban Outfitters with the family :) 
Just bought so much amazing stuff ! Got the sweater , necklace , tights , and tanktop of my dreams , and the most amazing headband ever . Now going to Wii and have a much needed spa night :) 
Can anyone guess what the high is going to be tomorrow ? Anyone guess 30 ? Wrong . How about 20 ? Nope ! Anyone guess 12 ? CORRECT . I guess that's when I'll be doing my watercolors , playing Just Dance and Zumba , and collecting the remaining < PROPFEMALE > coins in Super < PROPFIRST > . There is no way I can survive outside in that weather lol 
In a weird mood today . I have some things to get done , but I don't know how to get it all done . I wish I had someone with me all the time who could just help guide me lol 
I lost like 3 friends on Facebook these last couple of days . Oops , lol 
I love family photos . We are such characters :) I hope we use the ones where me and my mom are reindeer and < PROPMALE > is the sleigh driver . 
Happy Thanksgiving :) Thank you to everyone who has influenced my life . Yes , even the people I don't like , and the people I do like , and the people I hardly even talk to anymore , because without you , I won't be where I am today . I hope everyone has a fantastic day :) 
Ra Ra Rasputin ! :) 
It's that time of night when my filter shuts off and I just begin to say whatever pops into my head . Ohhhh boy . 
I wish I had some money so I could really take advantage of Black Friday . Not like I really need anything , but you can never have enough dresses . Or shoes . Or anything else that might be on sale :) 
Excited to see < PROPMALE > today :) 
I am so madly in love with my boyfriend :) <3 
Shame on < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > for making fun of me because I'm passionate . Not everyone can be heartless like him . 
You know what ? Homework just doesn't sound appealing right now . I think I'll dance around instead . 
Cannot wait for tomorrow :) 
I keep refreshing the Advanced Theatre Workshop < PROPFEMALE > , even though I still have to wait another hour . Hurry up !! lol 
I GOT IT ! :) 
So , I'm in a pretty loving mood . And right now , I don't think anyone can piss me off . :) That's a pretty big deal . haha 
So , for anyone searching for that perfect Christmas present for me ... There's a 15% off sale on the Say Anything merch site , for a limited time only ! I love everything , but I already have the yellow shield shirt :) So , think about it . 
City tomorrow with < PROPMALE > ? Sounds like potentially the best day ever :) 
Thanks < PROPMALE > Meyer for a fantastic day :) 
Lousy mood :\\ I just miss everything . 
Hey . If you're reading this , you should really try to make my day , because today really feels like it's going to be lousy , and I'd rather it wasn't . 
Uh-oh . I'm feeling my old ways creeping back in . Insomnia and procrastination together are as dangerous as Pop Rocks and Coke . 
Ah ... I need something to do :\\ I already cleaned , read , sang , finished homework , stirred a new jar of organic peanut butter , invited my brother to play a game , made fun of people on YouTube , and procrastinated the rest of my homework . What now ? 
It seems that as my brother takes on adolescence , it is so much easier to hit a nerve with him . It's really so easy . :) I have been waiting for the opportune moment to take my revenge , and it thankfully came before I moved out . There must be a god . 
I'm trying to research studies of procrastination , but you have to buy the articles ! That's what you get for procrastinating your research for the last second . 
:) Pyzano's pizza for dinner . I must have been good this year . lol 
Tomorrow will be amazing because < PROPMALE > days are always the best days . Oh , and I have voice tomorrow :) 
I think I'm getting sick D: 
Sometimes I feel bad for some of the things that's happened . But I just gotta remember that it's all for the better . 
Congratulations to < PROPFIRST > - he just took his first video on his iPod , of us improvising \Pee on Me \"" 
Does anyone want to see < PROPMALE > Bemis ' solo show with me February 26 ? :) Presale goes on today . 
I really hate this whole being sick thing . And I don't even know what it is , seeing as all I have is a sore throat , the occasional headache , and serious stomach pain , but I get all of those on their own quite often . So ...? 
Hm ... What to do today ? I really don't want to sit around the house all day , so if any of my fantastic , wonderful , amazing friends want to make plans with me ... I would love it :) 
Going to make cookies that look like poker chips and watch season one of Mad Men :) 
OMG . Going through an old notebook of stuff I've written , and I found this piece of a story I was writing . It was a stalker's journal . Brilliant . I can't believe I never finished it ! 
Getting a minor anxiety attack from all of these boundary violations :\\ I wonder if this is how the US/Mexico border feels . 
Not in SF today . 
My cat is drooling all over my pants . Thanks , Elphaba . 
When the world slips you a < PROPFIRST > , pet the furry wall . 
Yeah , I miss dance . 
I think , this year , I'll get a menorah ornament for the Christmas tree . 
To procrastinate my homework to the greatest extent I can , I just sang every song in my song book . Twice . I am so lightheaded lol Guess I can't do my homework yet :) 
Almost passed out today . Notttt feeling too great :( 
Great day for Katarina Wagner and me :) 
Tired . Babysitting JT :) Hopefully seeing < PROPMALE > , then mock trial at 8:30 in the morning . I don't even go to school that early . 
Watching Little Shop of Horrors :) < PROPFEMALE>'s voice is my inspiration for Chi-Chi's lol . 
A Russian doll ornament will have to suffice . Couldn't find any menorah ornaments anywhere :( 
I need something to do today . Pleasepleaseplease give me a suggestion . \ 
i need 
Does anyone want to go to the < PROPMALE > Bemis ( from Say Anything ) in SF on Feb 26 with me ? :) I don't want to go by myself ! 
Ice skating tomorrow :) I really need to get out of the house . I'm so excited . I WAS going to have a little Lady Gaga day tomorrow , but I think I'll have to postpone it ;) 
What in the world did I do to deserve this crazy in my life ? 
Wants to sing a duet with someone to break up the monotony of the bland stuff I've been singing . Yes ? 
Gonna go tour NIF , then going to make a video , then research at the library :) Going to keep myself so busy , I won't have time to worry about drama . 
:) Just made a video of me singing that I actually really like . My voice cracked once , but it actually isn't that bad ! Ahhh , I'm so happy :) 
So . In the mood to see Social Network ( again ) and/or Black Swan sometime this week . Anyone want to be my date ? :D 
I haven't eaten anything all day because nothing sounds good ... But I need something to give me energy so I can go walk to Strizzis . Hmmm . 
Happy Christmas < PROPFEMALE > in the Bean-Owen household :) 
I feel like calling random people and leaving < PROPFIRST>'s mom's voicemail :) \That was a very loud beep ... \"" 
I shouldn't be sad during Christmas time . 
I need something to do besides a Mad Men marathon and drawing too many pictures from the Little Mermaid because that's what I've been doing all week . Anyone want to call me and help me plan a poker tournament for Thursday ? 
What did I do today ? Watched Mad Men , because it turns out I accidentally started watching season 3 and skipped season 2 , which explains why I was so confused ! I also cleaned my room and organized my magazines . I'm still in my pjs and glasses . This day will never get started lol 
I have to figure out when I can do poker night at my house this week , because I'm not sure Thursday will work out . Hmmm ... 
I have Bye , Bye , < PROPFEMALE > stuck in my head ... 
Poker night at my house :) Maybe I'll even make some cookies or brownies for the occasion . 
It is SUCH a great day :) 
Today is the day :) Really looking forward to getting my license !! 
I passed !!! :) 
Excited to ring in the new year in < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > with my best friend :) I'm really hoping that all of the crazy of 2010 will stay in 2010 . 
Watching Eclipse with an unstoppable bloody nose . 
Every kid's dream : to stay home on the first day back to school from vacation . Unfortunately , this time , I'm really really sick . 
Finally got out of bed to eat . Every time I move , my head threatens to explode . :( 
I want to feel better , but I don't want to go back to school . What a dilemma . 
I hate driving by myself because it only reminds me how alone I am in life , and how I'm driving myself away from everyone I love . My psyche is strange . 
:\\ How am I supposed to sing/ get in character when I'm so sick ? 
It's hard to decide who I love more , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , or < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > . Or Stalin . 
Should've gone to voice , but I'm way to sick to sing lol I need something else to do to keep me busy today . 
If someone is bored enough to make me a . gif of < PROPMALE > from Modern Family shooting < PROPFEMALE > with his water gun , I will be forever indebted to them ! 
Watching Scooby Doo . The best part of the whole movie ? Either Mary-Jane being Shaggy's favorite name , or < PROPFIRST > Doo . 
I am so freaking excited for today :) It's going to be SUCH a great day ! 
I don't want to be home the rest of the night :\\ 
I don't want to do homework , but < PROPMALE > ruined my procrastination . I'm not even sure what I have to do ... lol 
CAN'T GO TO THE < PROPMALE > BEMIS CONCERT BECAUSE IT'S CLOSING NIGHT OF OUR PLAY . 
Awful night :\\ Just ... Ugh . 
My mom just told me to Google < PROPFEMALE > Hendricks ' Playboy photos . lol ! 
I told my mom I want to go to Kohl's ... And she reminded me that I have my own license , I can go whenever I want . Then my brother said I'm a fail teenager . 
I love < PROPFIRST > Burnett . 
It's so hard to have faith in human relationships when you're surrounded by all the ways they can fail . 
< PROPFIRST > Eisenberg and < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > are def my current crushes . And will be for a while . 
WHAT THE- ANOTHER PAIR OF JEANS WITH A HUGE HOLE IN THEM . 
I've spent my entire afternoon acting out < PROPFEMALE>'s Lament from Guys and Dolls and basically any Miss Hannigan scene from < PROPFEMALE > . But , I suppose it's time to do homework now :( 
Found some great monologues for the contest in Drama Club :) 
Going to bed early so I can make it to first period and write a kickin ' argument and donate blood . Yeeeeeah ! 
Just want to say thank you to everyone who have been so nice to me lately . :) It's really making my week . 
The awkward moment when < PROPFEMALE > barges in on you and your guitar . 
Exhausted . And stressed . I have so much to do , but no will to do it ! PS , I don't have to babysit tomorrow , and I have a car , so who wants to do stuff ? 
That awkward moment when you dress up like a glorified prostitute for drama then realize you have to walk downtown looking like that . 
Going to see Titanic the Musical tonight in Newark at 8 pm ! Anyone care to join ? 
Now I have no reason at all to be upset for like the entire week . :) Thank you . 
Okay , I really don't want to drive to Newark by myself . Does ANYONE want to go see Titanic with me ? Pleassssse ? 
sucks at defrosting a car . 
There's nothing like whining about your problems to make you realize you really don't have many . 
Ouch . Using my own morals against me . That's a tough one lol 
Mommy doesn't want to dye my hair for me , so I guess I'll have to try doing it solo . Yikes ! 
I honestly have nothing else to do besides homework , so I'm doing all of this history work that I don't even have to do . Wow . 
So exhausted . But still the happiest girl in the world . 
< PROPMALE > Waits ' voice makes me melt . 
Can I have < PROPFIRST > Eisenberg's babies please ? 
So exhausted . I really need to sleep . But I'm so busy today , I won't be able to take a nap , or even go to bed before midnight . :\\ Gonna be a long week . 
Note to future boyfriends : our song will either be A Walk Through Hell by Say Anything or < PROPFEMALE > by Guns n Roses . Plan accordingly . 
Thinking of who my doppelganger is ... Maybe I'll just stick with < PROPFIRST > Tisdale for this week . 
I am so excited for my research paper . I'm basically explaining how Facebook causes college students to procrastinate . Like I need research to tell me that , haha . 
I need a cure for anxiety . I'm going to get like an ulcer or something before I even get into college . Pretty sure I'm getting gray hair . 
Just finished with my outline and drawing of the timeline . I just need to do the write-up part and study for the biotech midterm . Where is my calculator ...? 
And since I can't find a really good doppelganger , I guess I'm going with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > . 
Stress can breed a psychopath . You're all that calms me down . I forget that I'm a mess when you're around . Please can you be home tonight , say its not over yet . 
I'm going to bed at 7 tonight with a shot of Nyquil so that I can sleep , with absolutely no interruptions . This insomnia thing is getting out of hand . 
So with a thousand sweet kisses , I'll cover you . 
So hungry . Debating whether or not to experiment with brownie recipes . I'm thinking a caramel peanut butter brownie swirl . Or something Valentines Day themed . 
School is starting to require more work on my part ; however , I am completely lacking the motivation to do anything . What do I do ? :\\ 
I guess I should go to bed so I can wake up early to take the Biotech midterm I missed on Monday . School needs to get more fun like NOW . 
< PROPFEMALE > , so anyone who wants to go bowling from 9-11 tomorrow let me know by 5 pm tomorrow so I know how many lanes to reserve ! 
What is sleep ? 
Excited to go bowling tonight with people :) It's gonna be loads of fun , even if I suck so much lol 
Voice , then painting the lovely theatre :) 
I need to Skype more people . 
Lost my photo ID ... I just shouldn't be trusted with anything . Going to be an interesting week ... 
Found my Chi-Chi dress :) So excited to show everyone tomorrow ! 
Got my first grown-up job today :) 
I have \My Junk\ " stuck in my head ... " 
Well . Looks like < PROPFEMALE > Tripp and I are screwed tomorrow . 
Goodness , when do I get a break ? I have so much to do ! 
Now I have \The Bitch of Living\ " stuck in my head . rofl . " 
Do not talk to me until this trimester is over , or else I might strangle you . I wish I was joking , but I'm not . 
And while I nearly passed out at 5:30 , I can't seem to go to sleep now . Funny how that works . 
Really hating this research paper right now . 
First night on the job . Wish me luck !! 
I like Strizzis :) 
Hypnophobia- fear of sleep 
Just wasted 2 hours of my life in the worst movie ever haha . Now I have to do a butt load of homework before I go to work , and hopefully finish everything when I get home . 
Only on < PROPFEMALE > 3 of my research paper ... and I'm running out of things to talk about ? What ? 
So I'm totally done with my research paper ... but it's only 4 pages long . Uh . Help ! 
I have you all beat . I'm working on my research paper ... about procrastination . It is 10:44 pm the night before it's due , and I am not even halfway done , and I still have loads of homework to due . And I'm going to be at school for about 12 hours straight tomorrow . Bring it on ! 
Cuss this . I'm turning in a 4 < PROPFEMALE > essay . I'd rather have 4 < PROPFEMALE > s of pretty good stuff than 4 < PROPFEMALE > s of pretty good stuff , with another 4 < PROPFEMALE > s of total BS'd crap . 
Just found an article titled \Validating human-robot interaction schemes in multitasking environments\ " . Just thought I'd share that . " 
I'm tired . I at least got my paper to be 5 pages . I don't want to do anything but sleep . Ugh . See you all in a monthhhh 
Yeah , that whole \don't talk to me till the end of the trimester\ " thing is still in effect . Even more so today . " 
iodgfnerafwefg I'm dead . 
I'm in the mood to go to Yosemite and hike that Mist Trail . Anyone care to join ? 
The best part of my night ? Mr. Frye reciting The Godfather , complete with the voice and everything . I died . 
Come see My Son is Crazy , But Promising tomorrow at 7 pm at the Little Theater at Granada ! :) It's hilarious . Guaranteed you will be laughing . 
Awful . Awful night . I don't really want to do this play anymore . I mean , I still will , but I just am done . 
Opening night tonight :) Be sure to see My Son is Crazy ... But Promising tonight at 7pm in the Little Theatre at Granada ! :) Break a leg , everyone ! 
Hey , all friends and drama kids ... Party at my house after the show ? Yes ? And I'm thinking improv earlier before the show , I bring pizza ? 
Improv for MSICBP cast before the show ( just whenever you get to the theatre until Watts gets there ) and then come see My Son Is Crazy ... But Promising tonight at 7 ! It's a great show ! 
OMGOMGOMG guys , my vintage black crepe dress FITS me now . I can't wear a bra with it , but it zips up all the way now ! Gonna go do my happy dance now ! 
Mom woke me up early to go out to breakfast . Not even hungry , but whatever lol . As soon as I get home , I am going back to bed ! :) 
Ugh . :\\ 
Ugh . I don't really want to care about anything anymore . It's so much easier to just become apathetic and let things roll off me . Unfortunately , though , I was born with an amazing depth for passion , so apathy is not really possible . 
To everyone in MSICBP : we're going out for donuts at the Donut Wheel after the show ! :) Let me know if you need a ride , and we can arrange something 
:) Man . I almost don't want tomorrow to come . It'll mean the end ! :\\ 
Last night for My Son Is Crazy ... But Promising ! Tonight at 7 pm at Granada High's Little Theatre ! $5 with ASB , $7 without , and to the cast , pie at < PROPFEMALE>'s after ! 
I can't believe I cried in front of so many people tonight ... Man , I'm going to miss all of you guys . I love you so much , and I don't want to think about performing without you . Shoot , I'm crying just typing this !! 
I missed < PROPMALE > Bemis last night :( But , it was so worth it . I had such a fantastic time with my family . I refuse to believe we will never improv backstage again ! Can't wait to see you all again on Monday ;) 
Oh , I had another Communist revolution dream again last night . I haven't had one of those for such a long time ! This one was the most believable , though . Oh , and during a revolution celebration , they got Green Day to play in front of the Bankhead ... whaaat ? lol 
There are too many careless people in the world . 
3 more chapters of history , 20 more dates for the timeline , and 5 more chapters of biotech . It's 4 pm . Can I do it ? 
Couldn't sleep :\\ I kept like waking up and looking at the clock and counting down how many more hours I had to try to sleep . Something just isn't right with me lol . 
Thank god this trimester is over . I did actually dance a little as the < PROPFEMALE > rang lol . But my stress feels even worse :\\ 
Such a successful shopping day . Now I'm gonna ceilidh at Ceilidh's :) I love cast parties !! <3 
Why . 
Getting my iPhone today ! ... After I clean my room . \ 
\ 
So really , I'll be getting my iPhone in a week ;) 
Just got my iPhone :) need new pictures and ringtones though . 
Do not talk to me this trimester either until I get Drama 3 added to my schedule , okay ? Honestly , I am so freaking pissed at the administration right now kfjgkrgnkejgn just give me my drama . 
Omg I got into drama I am so excited you don't even know !!! 
If I get < PROPFEMALE > in the play , every single one of you reading this status has to see me , you hear ? 
Ended with an 88% in both of my APs . Ughhhhhhh kill me why did they do this to me ? 
I have an hollow pit in my stomach . :\\ sigh . 
Only time will tell if getting into drama was worth having a 1st period ... Well , here goes day one ! 
Tsunami warning ? Good day to live in the valley . My thoughts go to all those in Japan ! 
Watching TV with my mom , and we see an ad for a rehab , and my mom tells me , \That's where we're sending you when you get your drinking problem . \ " ... When ?! " 
... Watts was going to post the cast list tonight , yes ? 
I haven't been able to hear out of my left ear since like Monday or Tuesday . Maybe that's bad ? 
Go to www.gaschoolstore.com , use ID 2154060 
I guess Watts isn't posting the cast list tonight ? I'm confused . 
Stage Manager ! Better start learning lines now ... Oh boy ;) 
Congrats to everyone in Our Town -- so excited to work with you guys ! :) 
My daddy sent me a text saying \Happy testing ! \ " Isn't that a little contradictory ? " 
I'm not bad , I'm just drawn that way . 
So excited to wear my new dress tomorrow . 
Www.gaschoolstore.com ID# 2154060 -- support our theatre ! Check it out ! 
>:( I just want to play Sims . But someone hid my disc . They will pay dearly . 
Need help choosing a Disney song to sing for voice . Colors of the Wind , God Help the Outcasts , Part of Your World , or When She Loved Me ? 
Lady Gaga ! 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > ? :( 
Seems suiting , to end a weird day with a weird night . 
What in the world is going on with my life . 
oh dear lord I am sore alllllllllllllllllllll over . but at least my cookies taste freaking amazing . 
Please let tomorrow be a good day . I can't stand this anymore . 
I love it when your friends are there for you , and they don't even realize how much you need them <3 
I can't believe this time next week , I'll be heading over to Hawaii ! :) so excited ! On a different note , my subconscious is getting pretty incentive with its nightmares lol 
Thank you < PROPFEMALE > Glass for being the voice of reason when I'm hysterical . :) 
Man . Rehearsing Act Three is going to be draining . I don't know why , but the whole thing just breaks my heart . I know I'm not a ghost or < PROPFEMALE > or even one of the family members , but hearing the whole thing just kills me . 
Give me something to do . Nothing productive has happened today , and I can't possibly go to bed knowing that ! 
I really need to party with my best friend < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > and paint our nails and recite Clueless from memory ! Need to forget about this week ! 
1980 on my SATs ! That's good , right ? 
Only true friends would download the Sims 2 disk 4 from the Internet and burn it to a disc for their technologically impaired friend . Thank you so much !! 
fgnjheakfhasijvn I have the Sims 2 , but now I can't find my expansion packs . Somebody shoot me now . 
Holy akwfhkdfjvgneuiarfh Little Shop of Horror auditions ?!?! OMG , everyone knows I can do the < PROPFEMALE > voice . I just wish I was a little older , so I could do it ... Because no one would cast a 16 yr old as < PROPFEMALE > in a professional theatre lol . Ohhh well . 
Leaving for Hawaii bright and early :) Text me ! 
Can someone invent teleportation already ? The time traveling between places sucks . At least a 5 hour plane ride is better than that 13 hour car ride I've done ... But still . 
I'm in a Communist and Say Anything kind of mood . What a combination . 
Lmao guys what if I did Over the < PROPFEMALE > for the dramatic reading of songs contest ? 
Reading my Stage Manager lines from Our Town with my Chi-Chi Vazoom voice . What is wrong with me . I get entertainment from this ? 
I finally figured out what is wrong with today : I didn't have a Smart Water . 
They told me going to the park at night would be fun . Turns out you can't see frisbees at night . So , now I have a fat , split lip . Sigh .
