I started a new Facebook < PROPFEMALE > . The people on my other one were too much drama .. 

Congratulations class of 2010 !! We did it guys ! :D I love you all , let's keep in touch ! x's and o's 
Graduation Party today :] Lemme know if you wanna go ! 
Today officially feels like the start of summer . :] 
I'm sick . What the hell :[ I need to feel better already .. 
Needs to feel better , now !! Whoever heard of getting sick the first days of your vacation ?? Ridiculous . 
Thursday already ?! :] 
Hanging out with my best friend . Oh , I'm going to miss you < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > !! 
Tonight = freaking awesome . This is definitely what I needed . Goodnight . Now to get up at 6 am in the morning . Ha . 
Has an appointment to get another tattoo at 6:00 Friday evening .! I'm freaking stoked ! 
Had an amazing birthday today . Thanks for all the birthday wishes !! 
I have a fair few things to do today ! And it's my mums birthday . I love you mum !! 
5 and a half hours later , my tattoo is done , and I love it .! F-ing brilliant . 
I put up a picture of my new tattoo , it's brilliant ! Check it out , and the shop where I got it done , Redlight Tattoo , On Coors and Gun Club , they're amazing ! 
Something about eating a bowl of cereal in the middle of the night is just awesome . 
My little sister , who mind you is 10 , thinks the government has cameras hidden in our house , and all other houses for that fact , watching us and our every move . She is amazing . haha 
Going to Moriarty in a bit with the family . Hell yeah for illegal fireworks ! 
So , today , I've been a vegetarian for 3 years .! I feel pretty damn awesome actually . Yay for vegetarians . 
I love my mum . She knows when I'm upset , and how to make me feel better , like 3 hour long talks , chocolate and a big hug when it's all done . Awesome . 
I feel like something important should be happening soon .. 
I wish it would rain . I want one of those days with the curtains pulled shut , movies and tea .. But why waste the sunshine ?! Damn Albuquerque 
Just watched a commercial on tv , where bp was trying to convince the public they`re doing everything to clean up the oil spill . I find it humorous they cannot afford to actually live up to their words but they can afford a bogus commercial . 
Sitting outside in the rain . I love when it rains , it makes everything feel so calm . 
Just finished sobbing over My Sisters Keeper . Amazing movie . Now , time to sleep . Goodnight ! 
Yesterday was my stepbrothers birthday , and today we're having a party for him ! Babysitting , making cakes and it's only 1 ! Busy day ! 
Wow . 
When < PROPFIRST > and I were talking today , apparently we were saying the ' F ' word a lot . So , my mum goes , \ There's a lot of fucking going on in here ! \ " ... \ 
Today : After registering for college . My Grandad : 2 things Jacks , 1 I'm proud of you and hope you are successful in whatever you do and 2 , you need to get some sun on those legs , you're starting to look as white as your mum . :) I love my family . Goodnight !! 
Happy Birthday to the best older sister ever in the whole wide world !! Hope you have a great day < PROPFEMALE > you deserve it ! 20 years old :) officially not a teenager anymore !! I love you bunches !! \ 
xoxoxoxo 
Feels like today has been a very good day :) 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone . \ 
It's not warm when she's away . \ 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone \ 
And she's always gone too long anytime she goes away . 
All of a sudden , \ 
It feels as everyone is far away . \ 
Who knew , ' growing up ' entailed ' growing apart ' ? \ 
No matter who says , \We'll always be friends ! \ " \ 
Late night talks about boys , singing about being an < PROPFIRST > Meyer weiner , our own rendition of the wheels on the bus , and trying to keep < PROPFEMALE > from cuddling with me in the middle of her sleep :P Best Friends :) I'm sure gonna miss you when you leave ! Love you < PROPFEMALE > Rogers <3 
I may be a democrat and all that , but I still think that < PROPFEMALE > Kagan is a schmuck and really has no place whatsoever on the Supreme Court . Silly Senate . :P 
Qué será , será . < PROPFEMALE > es tan inesperado , y estoy agradecido . Me encanta mi < PROPFEMALE > . <3 <3 
I love listening to 80's music . Definitely before I was born , yet I like it a lot more than music today !! 
I love drinking tea . Haven't done much this weekend , and it feels great . Relaxing with family is amazing . 
CNM is a pain in my ass , I have to wait around for an hour while the schmuck that helps me walks around and fucks off , then finally I get told basically , I'm screwed . Student loans here I come . Funny , my family that works get nothing , while the unemployed who suck enough shit from the gov't can go to financial < PROPFEMALE > and get more money !! So fair . 
Oh this whole week has been hectic . Let's hope this weekend is relaxing . 
My bestest friend is leaving tomorrow :( Going with her to Taos to say bye ! Goodnight .! 
A couple hundred < PROPMALE > , several Kleenex , and a plethora of tears later , and I'm back in Albuquerque , and my best friend is now living in Taos . Lame =[ However , things will all work out , and we'll see eachother soon ! But now , I'll be emotional with her family tonight . Ice cream anyone ? 
Now has a $2500 student < PROPFEMALE > I have to pay off at some point in time . I heard prostitues make good money , right ? \ 
ha just kidding . \ 
\ 
... \ 
School . :P 
Oh < PROPFIRST > Idol , your pugnacious attitude , along with catchy punk-pop lyrics make my day happy . Oh , and let's not forget the sneer ! :) \ 
So let's sink another drink\ 
' Cause it'll give me time to think\ 
If I had the chance\ 
I'd ask the world to dance\ 
And I'll be dancing with myself .. 
After a conversation with < PROPFEMALE>'s mum on relationships , it's funny yet un-reassuring to know the drama never changes no matter how old you are . And that the question , \does age really matter ? \ " always comes back into play . \ 
I found this poem I wrote in elementary school when I looked through an old box of school work of mine :\ 
The Love Poem\ 
Your face shines like a bright light . \ 
Whenever I see you I fill up with delight . \ 
Even if you're new , \ 
I still like you . \ 
And I think you are just right . \ 
<3 awwww ! 
Semi-charmed life\ 
<3 \ 
In the best way possible . 
Take it on the run baby . \ 
If , that's the way you want it baby . \ 
<3 
Tomorrow , is Friday :) \ 
Thank goodness . \ 
Had a fun night . Dinner ( even if it was cow-smelling ) with friends , and driving everywhere with < PROPFIRST > Martinez and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > ; British accents included . \ 
What would you do if my heart was torn in two ? \ 
More than words to show you feel\ 
That your love for me is real . \ 
What would you say if\ 
I meant , every word I said\ 
When I said that I love you\ 
I meant that I love you forever\ 
And , I Fall behind-\ 
The second hand unwinds\ 
If you're lost you can look -- and you will find me\ 
Time after time . \ 
Music Montage !! 
Don't you know it's a woman's right to choose ? \ 
She can pick for herself what to lose . \ 
When it comes time for abortion\ 
They blow it all out of proportion , \ 
And now it's on the list of taboos . \ 
Oh the conversations I have with an old friend of mine . \ 
And this time ; in limerick :) 
\I thought I'd forget you 
Going to Taos tomorrow to visit my bestfriend :) I'm excited !! \ 
Well , I had to . \ 
... 
.. \ 
Late nights watching movies with the family , \ 
Drinking and popcorn , < PROPFIRST > snoring on the couch ; \ 
Let's wake up at 6:30 for my step-brothers football game ? \ 
Sounds good . \ 
Looking forward to this weekend . \ 
I <3 my family 
Things will get better . \ 
Everything can only get better from here . \ 
I know everything worthwhile takes time , so I'll wait . 
Does it bother anyone else when people pronounce things wrong ? Like , instead of crayon being said the way it is spelt , people say it as if they're saying the word crane !! What the hell ! 
I'm not the kind of girl you take home ... \ 
Went to a candle-light vigil tonight , for < PROPFIRST > Checkley , who passed away this weekend . He was only 24 . You never know what can happen in life , so < PROPFEMALE > it , this is the only time you have to live it , live it well , and make sure to love it , and everyone that is a part of it . \ 
Went out to lunch at Chile's with my dad :) \ 
Had an awesome time ! \ 
This week is good , and now , my weekend starts ! \ 
Had a quite amazing day . Got to see a lot of old friends :) \ 
Oh , and < PROPFEMALE > Gallegos , you are simply amazing , thank you for all the help you've given me , it means alot . \ 
I hope everyone had a lovely day :) 
But it's over now , and I don't know how , \ 
It's over now \ 
There's no getting back to good \ 
I swear , by my life and my love of it , that I will never live for the sake of another man , nor ask another man to live for mine . \ 
Wants another tattoo :) \ 
Again . I kinda think they're addictive ! \ 
At least it's not a bad addiction , just a pricey one !! 
Went to a balloon launch this morning with my little sister at her school , had tons of fun :) Went home , slept for awhile , and got my financial < PROPFEMALE > check ! Woo , let's go party :D Now , getting ready for work tonight . Hope everyone has a fantastic day ! 
Well , I like it anywhere . But , mostly the counter . And sometimes , the floor . \ 
Has 5 on it . 
Finished my essay . Thank goodness . < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > you're amazing for giving me your story to write about ! =) \ 
Hope everyone has a good day ! 
So glad I got to spend some time with my best friend this week , it was great to see her ! \ 
Now , hello weekend ! 
Bought one of those Airwick Motion Scented Oil Air Fresheners , and now I'm having fun walking/jumping/running past it to see if it really does emit a burst of fragrance ! \ 
I was thinking if you were lonely \ 
Maybe we could leave here and no one would know . \ 
Don't get me wrong , I completely support breast cancer awareness month , but why isn't there something like that to support men ? Like prostate cancer awareness month ? It's actually the 2nd most common cause of cancer deaths in men . Let's hear it for the boys .! Jockstraps across the Bosque instead of bras or something like that haha . \ 
Sticks and stones and weed and bombs\ 
Running when we hit ' em . \ 
Got a 90 on my mid term :) Hell yeah , I wanna have a party . \ 
Gonna miss everyone at Primitive Fear , this month was tons of fun , tonight especially , glad I'm home though , time to get a good nights sleep ! Hope everyone had a safe Halloween ! xoxo <3 
Productive day , or lazy day ? \ 
I'm leaning more towards lazy , at least I did laundry . \ 
Have a good day <3 
My nephew is one year old today , it's amazing how quickly the time went by , I'm so glad he's a part of our lives now , Happy Birthday < PROPFIRST > Alexavier Rios ! \

Feels nauseous . Ugh someone help me feel better ! \

Registered , got all the classes I wanted , and then I had this crazy epiphany and realized , F -- k , I have no idea what I want to do with my life . \ 
Two choices and I still haven't decided what to do ..! 
Would rather stay home and play video games than go to school . \ 
This semester needs to end already .
