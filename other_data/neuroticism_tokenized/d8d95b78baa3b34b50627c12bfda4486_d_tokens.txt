, were looking for something their own environment couldn't supply them with . Or they thought their own environment couldn't supply them with . So they gave up looking . They gave it up before they ever really even got started . \ " , 201 0-0 1-29 02:10:39 " 
I don't know why I bother staying up when I'm feeling so shitty . 
I don't even know what I was running for - I guess I just felt like it . ~ J.D. Salinger , The Catcher in the Rye , Chapter 1 
People always think something's all true . ~ J.D. Salinger , The Catcher in the Rye , Chapter 2 
I have a dislike button :D 
I hate that feeling you get when you see a lot of notifications and when you look none of it is really related to you :( 
Someone shoot me . So damn bored . 
Had an AMAZING night <3 
.............................................................................. <3 
I thought what I'd do was , I'd pretend I was one of those deaf-mutes . That way I wouldn't have to have any goddam stupid useless conversations with anybody . 
So bored * dies *

Go to urbandictionary.com and look up your fist name . Copy this in your status and what Urban Dictionary says about your name in the first comment . 
I have no faith in human perfectability . I think that human exertion will have no appreciable effect upon humanity . Man is now only more active - not more happy - nor more wise , than he was 6000 years ago . 
Schooooool :D ( Por qué ( Why ) am I actually enjoying it now ? o.o ) ? Teach_Friends_Selected_ http://www.languagebob.com 
Friday <3 Which means ..... um :( Weekends have lost their excitement . 
The ninety and nine are with dreams , content but the hope of the world made new , is the hundredth man who is grimly bent on making those dreams come true . 
Words have no power to impress the mind without the exquisite horror of their reality . 
Deep into that darkness peering , long I stood there , wondering , fearing , doubting , dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before . 
Man's real life is happy , chiefly because he is ever expecting that it soon will be so . 
A brilliant man who plays a fools game is just a fool in a guise . 
Someone please shoot me right now . 
I wish I had faith in an all-powerful person in the sky , so I could convince myself that someone had promised me that I'll be happy in the end . I guess there is still a < PROPMALE > though . That's life . 
The boundaries which divide Life from Death are at best shadowy and vague . Who shall say where the one ends , and where the other begins ? 
Finish every day and be done with it . You have done what you could . Some blunders and absurdities no doubt have crept in ; forget them as soon as you can . Tomorrow is a new day ; begin it well and serenely and with too high a spirit to be cumbered with your old nonsense . 
Gotta love listening to Party Boy to make myself fall asleep . 
Je ne peux pas apprendre l'espagnol . I'm screwed . 
MASS EFFECT 2 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
is sick .... so I can't play Mass Effect 2 !!!! D: 
I don't care how crappy I feel T-T I'm going to play Mass Effect 2 
I love my new cosplay ! <3 
I hate how lonely I get when I'm playing video games x.x They are very counter-productive for me 
I got my contacts in from singapore ! I hope they don't screw up my eyes ! <3 
I could eat someone's soul atm -.- I am so angry !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
fuck . just . fuck . 
You guys have no idea how proud I am of this < PROPMALE > roll . It is long , but it was SO worth it . file :// /C : /Users/Courtney/Documents/Omegle%20conversation%20log%20INDEED . html 
Why do I always mess up ?! 
* sigh * 
I can't tell whether I'm in a really good mood , or a really bad one . Oh well ! <3 
Agh . Bad mood . 
Yeah , nvm . Definitely not in a good mood . :\\ 
The worst days start off as good days . You always start off with high expectations on those days , and then they get completely crushed . I wonder what it's like to have a good day , where you're happy all the way through . I really can't stand living the way I do . Something has to change , and I know it's all because of me . I've always had a hard time changing . Someone help me . 
I loved watching City of Angels , but it sure made me more depressed . 
So apparently the lonelier I get , the more cliche romance comedies that I watch ... 
I L ??? ?? I ? G H ? PP ? 
): ?? o ? ? oo ?? s ???? I 
Finally started watching < PROPFEMALE > Trek :P 
I'm determined to make tomorrow a GREAT DAY <3 :D ( Watch it be horrible XD ) 
There is not enough love and goodness in the world to permit giving any of it away to imaginary beings . 
<3 Is man one of God's blunders ? Or is God one of man's blunders ?? 
\I cannot believe in a God who wants to be praised all the time . \ " - Friedrich Nietzsche " 
If I watch any more epic riding videos , my little heart may explode XD

I don't think I'm in any shape to be babysitting at the moment 
Watching The Last Unicorns in the hopes that a little nastalgia will cheer me up 
The only way I've discovered to stop my cousin's baby from crying is to show her photos of < PROPFIRST > Vermillion as she whispers \ < PROPFIRST >...< PROPFIRST >...< PROPFIRST >\" With every photo she sees of him XDDD " 
Knowing that < PROPFIRST > will be picking me up makes the school day that much easier ^^

Something about probing every planet in a galaxy , leaving it empty and worthless , gives a relaxing feeling of success XD 
< PROPFIRST > Vermillion came over tonight after work :DDDD We watched < PROPFEMALE > & Leopold ^^ Had a great time as always ! 
Does anyone play The Sims with the intention to keep them alive/happy and ENJOY it ? Personally , the engineering side of me keeps me using cheats to keep building epic buildings ... and then get bored of the people in them and kill them :( or make their lives miserable . Why aren't there cheats to start fires ? 
Lol I can't stop playing with this ring XD I'm sure the jingling noise is going to drive someone crazy at school on monday XD

I think I'll watch Mulan to give myself a short respite before getting back to doing more work ... The REAL Mulan too XD Not the Disney one . 
At the end of every good movie with a happy ending , I complain about how unlikely it would have been and how cheesy it is that everything turns out good ... but then at the end of any good movie with a sad ending , I complain about how sad it makes me that it didn't end happily XD 
I should definitely post a status message just so < PROPMALE > will comment on it :) 
THE HELL WAS THAT ?!?! Facebook just completely spazzed out on me 
I need to learn to keep my mouth shut

I'm pretty dang happy with life right now :) 
Doing myself a favor and going to work and horseback riding :) It will be a great pick-me-up for my mood ! Not that I've been sad XD I've just not been at maximum capaclity of happiness :P So I figure a week filled with < PROPFIRST > and Horses will make for a happy < PROPFIRST > ! 
Riding two horses , almost getting my butt handed to me by one , giving horsey baths ( which gave me an excuse to spray myself with a hose ) , cleaning a junk-load of leather gear , cleaning a barn , cleaning pastures ... 5 hours of non-stop work in the heat and I couldn't be happier :) If only I could just live my life like this without having to get another job T-T 
My 8 month pregnant horseback riding trainer was working in the barn , lifting heavy stuff , and trained me in the heat . I half expect her to be working on the day of her delivery , pop out the baby , and continue on with her day . That woman is crazy XD

I am so ashamed of owning an XBOX after seeing this E3 conference DX 
I'm going to make today a good day ^^

Me - \YUM ! \ " < PROPFIRST > - \ " Whatcha drinking ? \ " Me - \ " WATER !!! :D \ " \ 
So my Civil Engineering probably fat-fingered my grade for my Final . Somehow I got an F instead of the A or B that I expected . I have yet to get a C , much less an F in that class . I am so , so , SO angry . I can't reach the teacher either and it seems like he might have been fired because his school e-mail adress isn't working . 
Chilling at Starbucks for the next 4 hours until < PROPFIRST > gets out of work :) This is what I get got never getting my permit , much less my license XD Still had an awesome morning though !

Played Panzer Dragoon ORTA and ate ice cream with < PROPFIRST > Vermillion :) No fireworks , but that game was intense enough to make up for it XD 
Been up since about 5 or 6 ... blagh x.x I wanted to sleep !!!!! 
I can hear my tamagotchi screaming in the other room but I don't want to go get it @.@ 
Psalm 40:11 \

Does anyone have any suggestions for a happy movie ?

1 Chronicles 16:34 \

There is a certain dark , depressing feeling that washes over you when you realize that you share the birthday of the main character of one of the most hated novels of all time .

This is my face , covered in freckles with an occasional spot and some veins . \

It makes me angry that facebook won't let me change my name to Slowpoke >:( 
< PROPMALE > guyz ! I evolved :DDD 
Had a super fun day 8DDDD 
I can't stand headaches . Even the light hurts T-T 
Guy -\The only way we're going to survive a zombie outbreak is if we stay in a group . \ " \ 
I spent all day at the hospital . I now know that my closest aunt has lung cancer . < PROPFIRST > is a truly beautiful person , and it hurts me to know that someone I love so much is ill . The doctor's say that chemo may fix the problem , and I hope it will . To those who pray , please keep her in your prayers . To those who smoke , please reconsider your choices . 
Been sleeping at the hotel on the Mayo Hospital campus for a couple nights now . My aunt < PROPFIRST > really needs your prayers in this tough time . She's has multiple brain surgeries that have been successful so far , but there are still more fights to come . Please pray your hardest , we love her so much . 
In < PROPMALE > airport ! It's so crowded compared to JAX airport ! On my way to Oregon :) 
is having tons of fun in Oregonia ! 8D It was nice seeing my relatives too ! 
Leaving Oregonia :( Not looking forward to this whatsoever . 
I had the best vacation ever in Oregon ! I can't wait until the next time I can go back ! 
I'm kind of a big deal . People know me . :) 
I think somebody should definitely < PROPFEMALE > out with me this weekend :) Just saiyan . 
I love how I've been hearing more good news every day about us moving <3 I should be living out there by this Summer ! I am so psyched ! I love Oregon ! 
My wardrobe looks completely girl-ified now . I definitely need to go play some video games to balance this out ! XD 
I get the feeling that I did Spring cleaning a little too early this year . 
I am absolutely in love with my Turtle Beach headset <3 Gaming just got that much more wonderful . 
I've been listening to so much disco funk music that I think I might be starting to grow an afro 8 ) and I'm okay with it . 
Got my GameInformer . 14 pages on Elder Scrolls V ? I think YES ! Totally geeking out !!! I am SO PUMPED ! Bring me my longsword ! I'm ready to go slay some dragons 8 ) 
We hosted the memorial service for my Aunt < PROPFIRST > today . We had a very talented < PROPFEMALE > play his bagpipes as we walked along her favorite walk . It was beyond beautiful . < PROPFIRST > would have loved it , so I'm proud of how it turned out . I willl be missing her for a very long time . 
I need to get over feeling icky so I can go make a print of my storm trooper < PROPMALE > for < PROPMALE > !! So excited to see how it looks as an 8x10 ! :) the question is : should it be matte or glossy ? So far I'm thinking matte . 
My heart surgery is scheduled for February 24th ... I wish it wasn't so far away ! I really just want to fix this so I can feel normal . 
Waking up around 6:30 tomorrow and being robbed of a late night tonight ... Way to ruin my weekend , SATs !! :( 
SATs were disturbingly easy . I don't get why they had to separate them into 10 sections , either . It made it seem that much longer ! Now to enjoy my weekend 8 ) 
My mother has inadvertantly become addicted to iphone scrabble with < PROPFEMALE > . She'll never be the same again :( 
There is something humorous about watching House while you're laying in the E.R. ! xD 
For the week of my surgery , both < PROPMALE > AND my brother are visiting !! I am so excited !!!! I should have surgery more often ! :) 
Seriously considering picking up the violin again when I move back to Oregon . If I do , I'm so going to start playing the electric violin when I get the < PROPFEMALE > of it ! Hopefully I'll find it as easy as I did when I was little ! 
Apparently I'm going to Cumberland island today ... I'm going to be taking photos of wild horses on the island :) it wouldn't be possible without the generous offer from my awesome cousin < PROPFEMALE > to borrow her super quick zoom lens !! Thanks , < PROPFEMALE > ! 
About 2 more weeks until < PROPMALE > and my brother come to visit . I am so excited ! My doctor will fix up my heart and then I'll be a whole new me . After feeling ill off and on for so long , I feel like I'm being given a new lease on life ! :) I hope everyone is doing well ! 
Why aren't my SAT scores up ? They said February 10th .... it's 12:19 am on February 10th and they are not delivering ! People these days ... I guess I'll have to be like a normal person and actually check in the morning rather than creeping on the SAT site every few minutes . :( 
Did NOT meet my goal for SAT ! :( off by 50pts , but almost only counts with horseshoes and hand grenades . Don't mind me if you see me moping around school today because I didn't meant my own ridiculous standards ... Next try , I will meet them , though ! 
I hope everyone is having a Happy Valentines Day ! 
I'm not supposed to be eating chocolate ... but somehow half of my 24 chocolate box has gone missing ... :) yum 
< PROPMALE > arrives tomorrow afternoon ! Words can't express how excited I am ! 
< PROPMALE > will be here in a few hours ! With the power of sheer excitement , I have cleaned my rooms top to bottom , do 3 school assignments in record time , and now to get ready to bake after a trip to the store ! ULTRA PRODUCTIVITY INCREASE !!! 
Thanks to everyone who gave me their best wishes :) I'm doing okay , I just can't walk on my own yet . Things didn't go as planned , but hopefully it'll be better in the long run . 
Dropped < PROPMALE > at the airport . The rest of today will be very hard . 
Got an e-mail from my english teacher asking if I wrote my poem for my assignment or if I stole it because it was too good for someone my age . I don't know whether I should be flattered that they found it so well-written , or insulted that they didn't think I was capable of producing anything good . I think I'll choose flattered . 
I had too much fun with < PROPMALE > here :( Everything is so boring now ! 
Just watched the movie 5 Centimeters Per Second ... Most beautiful animation I have ever seen . Loved it , but so so sad . 
Did a photoshoot with < PROPMALE > yesterday , so some awesome photos are soon to come . Also might be modeling for the clothing store Cache in the near future . I love trying new things :) 
I just watched Spock die . Choking down some tears . \ 
Live Long and Prosper . :'( 
Guess who has two thumbs and has a 35mm AF-S DX Nikkor f/ 1.8 lens on its way ! Thank you so much to < PROPFIRST > Bourdon and < PROPFEMALE > Robinson ! I'm going to be a pro with that lens by your big day ! I'm so excited ! 
< PROPMALE > Nye The Sciene Guy is on CNN ! He says the evidence he's heard shows the meltdown has already started . Not good at all . 
Did a photoshoot for the lovely < PROPFEMALE > Ceribelli today ! Posting the results later :) 
Stuffy nose , fever , sore throat ... Pretty sure I'm sick . I need some miracle medicine to pull through so I can make it to the Green Project competition at St. Aug High on Wednesday ! Pray for me please , I need to be there for my group ! 
Going on Sick Day #4 :'( I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be able to breathe if it weren't for the magic of Neti Pots ! 
Hello < PROPFEMALE > themed photos ? I think yes . 
Adios Florida ! Leaving for Oregon for two weeks to see < PROPMALE > and the family :) woohoo ! 
I've got new hair :D super bright and colorful ! 
Stuck in Chicago airport while a new plane arrives ... They put us in a plane , closed all the doors , got us ready to take off , then made us deboard and wait 2 hours for another plane ... I need to get to Oregon !!! 
It's a sad feeling when you can't find a single reason to be happy about going home . 
I could really use a friend about now :( 
< PROPMALE > made me an excalibur-esque invite to prom out of a knife and note frozen in ice . I'm pretty sure I have the coolest boyfriend ever :)
