\You have brains in your head . You have feet in your shoes . You can steer yourself any direction you choose . You're on your own . And you know what you know . And YOU are the one who'll decide where to go ... \"~ Dr. Seuss " 
Leaving tomorrow to a state that has more than two seasons ! Ahhmazingness ! 
\I have heard there are troubles of more than one kind . Some come from ahead and some come from behind . But I've bought a big bat . I'm all ready you see . Now my troubles are going to have troubles with me ! ” ~ Dr. Seuss " 
Hasn't seen the sun since I left Tucson and I LOVE IT ! 
had a good day :) 
Dang so much on my mind now ... what to do ... what to do .... 
I try to remember the good times that we shared , but they are so far and few in between that it is hard to overlook the bad times . And when I decide to forgive you ... in the end , I believe our friendship is no longer salvageable . 
There are moments in your life when you discover a little bit more of who you are and who you want to be . I am so thankful for all of those moments , even the most painful ones because I know that after the pain is gone , I'll be stronger for it . 
Life has never been better !! < PROPFEMALE > comes today ! Tonight : Tacos ! Wednesday : Grand Canyon ! 
having a great night ! 
My best friend in the whole entire world leaves tomorrow and I'm very sad , but had an awesome time , with many amazing pointless adventures :) 
Like my status and I'll tell you :\ 
1 . Something I've learned about you from looking at your wall for 13 seconds . \ 
2 . The color you remind me of . \

\You can't lose something you never had . \"" 
Thank you everyone for the birthday wishes ! One of the best birthdays ever and its not even over ! :) :) 
Its not the length of friendships that matters ... It's the quality of friendships that does ... 
Had a very productive day of getting things done and figured out ... and to top it off ... I got to see my CBFF ! Good day :) 
..... seriously .....? 
Interview today , but first the Take Care Clinic to get rid of this cold . 
Keeping my fingers crossed 
Well that was an epic failure

19 days 
One paper down .... seven more to go .... I really hate school ..... 
Wow hell literally froze over today ! 27 degrees Tucson !? What the hell ! 
There comes a point in your life when you realize : who matters , who never did , who won't anymore .... and who always will . So , don't worry about people from your past . There's a reason they didn't make it to your future . 
You will never know if a decision is the right one or not if you don't do it . 
4 classes down , 1 more to go then off to graduation next Friday ! 
Finished all my classes ! Now just have to try and patiently wait for Friday .... 
On the way to Flagstaff ! 
6 hours and counting ! Too anxious to sit still ! 
Did it ! D.O.N.E ! Yay ! 
angry birds .... you're going to be the death of me . 
Car kinda fixed ... hopefully it won't blow up now driving to Colorado :) 
If people have problems with you , they need to come to you about it ... not someone else .... 
First Christmas not at home , so far so good , but missing my family . < PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone ! 
I hate you TEP ... way to ruin a perfectly good day . I'm pretty sure all electric companies are a spawn of the devil ... 
\We sometimes underestimate the influence of little things . \"- Charles W . Chesnutt " 
Looking back on these past four years , so much has happened . I've met some really great people , been on some awesome adventures , and learned a lot about myself . Life has been amazing ! But it's not goodbye , it's see you later ...

Today is my gramma's 95th birthday ! Hopefully we make it back in time for her birthday dinner ... 
It's six below .... was not prepared for this ... 
Sitting in a restaurant across from a guy who has \badass\ " tattooed above his right eyebrow and a picture of a cemetery tattooed on the back of his skull ... classic ! " 
Thank God for Skype ! 
It must be fun living in a delusional world ... lots of people are doing it lately ... 
Gotta love this place ... the sun is shining , and it's snowing ..... 
You ' re the worst type of villain there is , pretending to be something your not .... 
This whole spending 20 minutes to scrape ice off my car is getting old 
April can't come soon enough .... 
In the end , the love you receive is equal to the love you create 
The heat in my car is going out ... this is a big no bueno 
A wolf in sheeps clothing .... 
I wish May 12th was tomorrow so I could already be up on Mount Lemmon camping ... 
Had a discussion today with a lady about the difference between Colorado and Arizona for mexican food . She informed me that Colorado makes \real\ " mexican food ... as opposed to that \ " fake\ " stuff made in Arizona ... " 
30 degrees actually feels warm ... thats not even right .... 
Don't let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game 
Need an adventure .... 
You can't just pick and chose when you want to be in someones life . It's not fair to the other person . 
Dear month of May , please hurry the hell up so Lizco and I can go camping in AZ ! Thank you . 
Found out I have tonsillitis with an awesome ear infection ... fortunately I am still able to go to work tomorrow ..... yaaaaay 
I have applied for 10 different jobs today .... I hope I hear back from at least one company because this is getting old . 
Great way to start the day ... Jose Muldoon's with < PROPFEMALE > 
The mind is a powerful thing ... I just wish some people would use it . 
I used to like Usher until I found out he's to blame for < PROPFIRST > Bieber .... thanks for nothing Usher 
Went to go buy a box of girl scout cookie deliciousness and some guy jumped in front of me , handed the little girl money and announced he was donating $210 . Thanks a lot guy ... make me look like a cheap ass . 
Can't let one person ruin something thats meant to be good 
I've decided that taking random pictures of awkward people brings great joy to my life 
Hurry up Friday ! I really need you ! 
One day till my job interview and one day closer to an ahhmazing weekend ! 
Sometimes , when someone is worth it , you just have to put yourself out there 
Gotta worry only about yourself ... and the occasional friend ... family member ... coworker ... random stranger who has fallen on the street ... yup only on yourself 
Had an awesome weekend ! Now , another week closer to another amazing weekend :) 
I'm pretty sure my personal hell would be moving shit ... yup hell .... total absolute hell ... fire and all 
HEY YOU ! Yeah you ! The Village Idiots picketing fallen soldiers ' funerals .... Yeah , I'm talking to you ! Do you know WHY you are allowed to do that ? BECAUSE THE DEAD SOLDIER YOU ARE DISRESPECTING GAVE HIS OR HER LIFE SO YOU WOULD HAVE THE FREEDOM TO EXPRESS YOUR STUPIDITY ! Feel free to copy and post-I did because I wasn't afraid to express my undying gratitude to every single service person past , present and future . 
A wise person once said ... Don't trust someone that has no friends ... how right they are . 
Happy birthday to my awesome mom ! 
So the US Supreme Court has ruled that you have the right under the First Amendment to protest military funerals ... I invite you to start your protest in my front yard and we can see if your first amendment is better than my Second Amendment ... Repost if you feel the same
