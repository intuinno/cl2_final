attention all writers : to post something online is to publish it . dont do it . 
bloody revisions slaughter the entire of my writing and its soooo frustrating ... like having an infant construct a puzzle and being forced to let them muck with the pieces and at the same time fix it . of course i cant finish my stuff if someone who has no idea where i was going is changing my stuff .... stress relievers are only semi-effective at this point > : / ( caffeine and a7x i love you both )
