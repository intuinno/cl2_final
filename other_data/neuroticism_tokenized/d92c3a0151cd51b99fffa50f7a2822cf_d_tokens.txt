“I disregard the proportions , the measures , the tempo of the ordinary world . I refuse to live in the ordinary world as ordinary women . To enter ordinary relationships . I want ecstasy . I am a neurotic -- in the sense that I live in my world . I will not adjust myself to the world . I am adjusted to myself . ” - Anais Nin 
Happy 3 years < PROPMALE > , I love you so much , with all of my heart . You've made these past few years absolutely wonderful , and I wouldn't be where I am without all of your support and love . You make me the happiest girl in the world , and I cannot wait to grow old with you <3
