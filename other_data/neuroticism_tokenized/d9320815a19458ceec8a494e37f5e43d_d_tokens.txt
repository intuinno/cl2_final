I'll have you know\ 
That I've become\ 
Indestructible\ 
Determination that is incorruptible\ 
From the other side , a terror to behold\ 
Annihilation will be unavoidable 

If you even dream of beating me you'd better wake up and apologize . \ 
Muhammad < PROPFIRST > 
Im < PROPFEMALE > amazing 
So when I die I hope I live in the sky . All my folk who ain't survive may\ 
They live in the sky . Tell God I wanna fly and let me live in the sky .

Man made the trains to < PROPFEMALE > heavy loads\ 
Man made electric light to take us out of the dark\ 
Man made the boat for the water , like < PROPMALE > made the ark 
I look inside myself and see my heart is black\ 
I see my red door and must have it painted black\ 
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts\ 
It's not easy facin ' up when your whole world is black

It's true that we don't know what we've got until we lose it , but it's also true that we don't know what we've been missing until it arrives . 
If one dream should fall and break into a thousand pieces , never be afraid to pick one of those pieces up and begin again . ~ < PROPFEMALE > Weedn , < PROPFEMALE > and the Dream Maker

Did you hear about the < PROPFEMALE > that grew\ 
from a crack in the concrete ? \ 
Proving nature's law is wrong it \ 
learned to walk with out having feet . \ 
Funny it seems , but by keeping it's dreams , \ 
it learned to breathe fresh air . \ 
Long live the < PROPFEMALE > that grew from concrete\ 
when no one else ever cared . 
Anyone can give up , it's the easiest thing in the world to do . But to hold it together when everyone else would understand if you fell apart , that's true strength . \

People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are . I don't believe in circumstances .

Shaw , Mrs. < PROPMALE>'s Profession , 1893 
In this very moment I'm < PROPMALE > \ 
In this very moment I slayed Goliath with a sling \ 
This very moment I bring \ 
put it on everything , that I will retire with the ring \ 
and I will retire with the crown , Yes \ 
no I'm not lucky I'm blessed , Yes \ 
clap for the heavyweight champ , Me \ 
but I couldn't do it all alone , We 
We are still masters of our fate . \ 
We are still captains of our souls . \

Hello there the angel from my nightmare\ 
The shadow in backround of the morgue\ 
The unsespecting victim of darkness in the valley\ 
We can live like < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > if we want\ 
Where you can always find me\ 
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas\ 
And in the night we'll wish this never ends \ 
We'll wish this never end

The hero and the coward both feel the same thing , but the hero uses his fear , projects it onto his opponent , while the coward runs . It's the same thing , fear , but it's what you do with it that matters . \

“The self-confidence of the warrior is not the self-confidence of the average man . The average man seeks certainty in the eyes of the onlooker and calls that self-confidence . The warrior seeks impeccability in his own eyes and calls that humbleness . The average man is hooked to his fellow men , while the warrior is hooked only to infinity . ”\

I've been in the poem of many a poet , \ 
And I reside in the < PROPMALE > of many a < PROPMALE > ist\ 
Some of your sm < PROPMALE > est have tried to < PROPMALE > ictulate\ 
My whole p < PROPMALE > in this\ 
But they're fruitless in their harvestin'\ 
The drow grows from my footsteps\ 
I'm the one that they follow , \ 
I am the one that they march with 
With a warrior's mentality , impossible is nothing and the sky is the limit ! 
Cursed be the ground for our sake . Both thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for us . For out of the ground we were taken , for the dust we are ... and to the dust we shall return 
i really love boys <3
