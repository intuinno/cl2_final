The person who has never made a mistake in their life is allowed to talk shit about me once ! For all the others , and those who I do not even talk to why is it so hard for you to keep my name out of your mouth ? 
Can't is a word none should speak without blushing ; \ 
To utter it should be a symbol of shame ; \ 
Ambition and courage it daily is crushing ; \ 
It blights a man's purpose and shortens his aim . \ 
Despise it with all of your hatred of error ; \ 
Refuse it the lodgment it seeks in your brain ; \ 
Arm against it as a creature of terror , \ 
And all that you dream of you some day shall gain . 
Had a great time tonight ! Thanks girls ! 
Yay ! New car , finally . 
Saw My Darkest Days , Saving < PROPMALE > , and Hinder in concert with good friends , had a great time !!! :)

IT'S BROTHER'S WEEK ! If you have a brother who has made you laugh , punched you , stuck up for you , drove you crazy , annoyed you to no end , hugged you , wathced you succed , saw you fail , picked you back up , cheered you on , made you stronge , and is someone you are very proud to have in your life . re-post , even though they can be an idiot 
your smirking cause you think you've won and you think you have gotten away with it and I'm smiling & laughing cause i know you haven't .......... 
A true friend doesn't care when you're broke , being a bitch , what you weigh , if your house is a mess , what you drive , about your past , or if your family is filled with crazy people . Your conversations pick up where they left off , even if it has been months ( or even years ) apart . They love you ... for who you are . Re-post if you have at least one true friend . They will know who they are . 
Happy St. < PROPFEMALE>'s Day ! Come see us at < PROPFIRST>'s for < PROPFEMALE > food and drink specials all day !!
