Thanxs to < PROPFEMALE > Wright , this is already one hell of an awesome night . :) Making a pizza with BBQ sauce on it , haha . Then making brownies or cookies lmao . I feel like I'm high & have the munchies . o.O 

Seriously ... 2011 is going to be just as bad as 2010 has been . It just flat out fucking suxs not being able to have what you know that you want , & need . I know what I want , I know what I need ... But I can't have it , & that's what hurts the most . :( Plz 2011 , plz be better than 2010 has been to me ... Plz ... 
I loved you , you made me , hate me . You gave me , hate , see ? It saved me & these tears are deadly . You feel that ? I rip back , every time you tried to steal that . You feel bad ? You feel sad ? I'm sorry , hell no fuck that ! It was my heart , it was my life , it was my start , it was your knife . \ 
This strife it dies , this life & these lies . 
I kind of wish that I could go back in time ;; I'd change a couple things , but nothing drastically ;; Just change some things that I regret not doing ... ;; I miss how things used to be , last year ;; Why can't this year be that way ? Who knows , maybe , just maybe , I'll have the opportunity to gain some more memories with those who matter the most ... ;; 
Finally got to see my brother after like , 8 months ... Wish my dad would get whatever's up his ass , out , I'm not putting up with this shit again today . >.< Fuck it . Text me . 
So Two-Bit & I established that I'm SodaPop lol . Woot . This was totally an epic weekend . 17 more days , I can't wait ! :) 
Dont believe everything happiness says . Nothing feels better than hiding these days . We bury our fears , in the drinks & these tears . For the days we believed we could fly . Call up your brothers and sisters and friends . We'll go back to the place where the night never ends . We'll remember the fires , the burning car tires . Boy how in the hell we'd get here ? 
This night just got SOOOOOOOOOOO much better ! :) I feel like I'mma have a heart attack , lol . But my night just improved by like 1,000 % ! Text me if you have the number , if not , ask . 
Dad : Wonder if there are any latex gloves are over this way ... \ 
Me : Eh , bout the only latex things you'll find over here are condoms . \ 
Lmao , good times in Wal Mart , especially when looking for latex items lmfao . :) \ 
-- Single , think you can change it ? Haha . 
--> Boy Meets World --- \ 
Eric :[ Singing]For he's a jolly good fellow , for he's a jolly good fellow , for he's a jolly good fellow , which nobody can deny . \ 
Eric :[ Candles are knocked over , & light the curtains on fire]The curtains are on fire , the curtains are on fire , the curtains are on fire , which nobody can deny . 
I feel horrible . Sick to my stomach . & Crying . :'( 
It's been this long , yet nothing's changed . I still have the same feelings for you . I wish we talked more . I miss the sound of your voice . =/ I know I'll never get the opportunity to be with you , but that doesn't stop me from thinking , \What if ... \"" 
I am the heartache , you built by your deception\ 
A blind leap of faith , despair for passing season . \ 
Sink in Anger , fountains forming\ 
Spills like thunder to what we're holding\ 
Sleep forever now my darling\ 
I won't dwell on Heaven's Calling 
\It's ok . It's cool . It ain't a party til somethin gets broken . \ " -Gotta love St < PROPMALE>'s Fire :) * hmu*\\n * . LoveHateSexPain . * " 
Funny how someone can be so conceited ... You say one thing , & they automatically think you're talking about them . Grow up ! \ 
Text me if you wanna talk , makin a trip to town for a couple things . 
Haha . I'm a bad parent ? Have you looked in the fucking mirror ?! I never fucking walked out on Azaray , you did ! So I suggest you quit fucking harrassing me . Or you will regret it . I promise it . So fuck off & have a shitty day . :) 
So much better off without him in my life . :) Good thing I've learned to move on , otherwise , I'd still be letting myself get treated like shit & controlled all the time . So proud to say that I don't need him to help with raising Azaray . We don't need him . :) \ 
\ 
* Hmu on the cell * 
I'm proud to say that I'm a mother to such a beautiful , amazing lil girl . :) She has definitely changed my life for the better ! So glad to know that I'm not going to be dealing with that dumbass anymore . :) No respect for me , her , or my family . Stupid fuck . Iloveyou , AzarayLynne :) \ 
< PROPFEMALE>'s a bitch . One day it will come back & bite you in the fucking ass ! & when it does , I'll be there laughing in your face !!! You deserve it you dumb fuck !! 
So ... My sister totally just compared me to a one night stand . haha . Gotta love family . <3 \\n * . LoveHateSexPain . *

& Maybe It's Time To Change , & Leave It All Behind , I've Never Been One To Walk Alone , I've Always Been Scared To Try , So Why Does It Feel So Wrong , To Reach For Something More , To Wanna Live A Better Life , What Am I Waiting For ? \ 
Cuz Nothing Stays The Same , Maybe It's Time To Change ;; 
Why must Jamestown be so lame ? Then on top of that , there's barely anyone to < PROPFEMALE > out with around here . >.< I've come to the conclusion that I really miss J-ville ... 
Jamestown is officially the lamest place I've ever lived , haha . Not too many people to < PROPFEMALE > out with , drama filled , & lame . Hell . I need plans . Who's up for makin plans or doin something soon ? 
Wanting to know if anyone would be interested in seeing Avenged Sevenfold , Hollywood Undead , & Stone Sour in January ... 
Can we forget about the things I said , When I was drunk , I didn't mean to call you that , I can't remember what was said or what you threw at me , Please tell me , please tell me , Why , My car is in the front yard , And I'm Sleeping with my clothes on , Came in through the window last night , And your gone , Gone , It's no suprise to me I am my own worst enemy\

Still needing someone to go to the Hollywood Undead/Avenged Sevenfold/Stone Sour concert . Any takers ? \\n * . LoveHateSexPain . * 
Done dealing with stupid bitches & douche bags . I'm glad I've moved on from all of that , & I no longer have to worry about assholes who don't matter that much anymore . :) New year , new start . Time to dump all that bullshit in the garbage & move on in life . So far , successful . :) 
So glad I've moved on from all the drama & bullshit . I know who I need , & want in my life ; & who I don't . I'm just ready to start somewhat fresh this year ... But , it sucks that you can't always have the what , or who , you want , but then again , things can change , just gotta give it time . Anyways , if I know you , personally , text me 937 396 9897 ; if I don't , you might not wanna bother at this moment ... 
<3 Here today , gone tomorrow ; But you'd have to walk a thousand < PROPMALE > ; In my shoes , just to see ; What it's like , to be me ; I'll be you , let's trade shoes ; Just to see what it'd be like ; To feel your pain , you feel mine ; Go inside each others ' minds ; Just to see what we'd find ; Look at shit through each others ' eyes ; Don't let ' em say you ain't beautiful ; They can all get fucked , just stay true to you ;; <3 
Anyone want a male Chihuahua pup around 5-6 months . Free . My cousin has it , & her & her bf are looking to get rid of it because they don't have the time to spend with him . Needs some help with housetraining , very lovable , doesn't bite . If you're interested text me ( 937-396-9897 ) or comment this post . 
All I have to say right this moment , is Fuck My Life ... Don't ask unless you're family , or a close friend , cuz it's not really anyone else's business . 
Debating ... Movies , club , or partying with some friends for my b-day next month ? Which seems like it would be better ; just askin ' for opinions . 
I need a job . I need my license . I need a car . I need a lot of shit just to get me away from all this shit , even if it were just for a few days ... 
Cuz I'm broken when I'm open , & I don't feel like I am strong enough , Cuz I'm broken when I'm lonesome , & I don't feel right when you're gone away ;; 
I think I'm in love with < PROPMALE > Kushner , lol . Love his work . ( to some , that may be extremely odd , lmao . ) 
Never give up on someone you can't go a day without thinking about ... \\n-NotAfraid ; 
I need something fun to do . Hmu . 
I bet NOBODY can get all of these questions right(lol ): \

These lies are leading me astray , It's too much for me to stay , I don't wanna live this < PROPFEMALE > , It goes on endlessly , I see you so please stay strong , I'll sing you one last song , & then I'm gone , I don't wanna live this < PROPFEMALE > , It goes on endlessly , This love this hate , Is burning me away , This love this hate , Is burning me away ; 
Gotta love the fact I'm having a totally ( normal ) conversation with my dad about weed . :) haha . \\n-NotAfraid ; 
Is it me , or is it just extremely ANNOYING when you're trying to be serious , or have a serious conversation , & the person you're messaging , or texting , or whatever , wants to put \lol\ " in almost everything they say ? " 
People are so stupid these days . Someone from Dayton literally attacking a < PROPMALE > Horton's worker all over a donut ! WTF !? \\n-NotAfraid ; 
So . Before I completely forget , mine & Azaray's b-days are comin up in about 3 weeks . Who is wanting to come for either one , or both ? I need to know before hand because I gotta know what to get together & everything ... ( Yes I'm posting this a few weeks early , but that's because I'm totally forgetful & probably wouldn't remember to post this at a later time ... ) 
To Wong Fu : Thanks For Everything < PROPFEMALE > Newmar -- Probably the ONLY movie you get to see < PROPFIRST > Swayze & < PROPFIRST > Snipes , both , dressed in drag . <3 this movie :) 
Hollywood Undead at the Tri-County mall , 1pm on the 29th , I sooo wanna go . But then again , I wanna go to the concert still , too . But still need a ticket , & they're probably sold out , already . Ugh . Fuck . Someone let me know if they are or not , so I can try to get one if they aren't sold out ... 
I love how foggy it is right outside Jamestown . Makes me wish I lived out here , or on a back road ... \\n-NotAfraid ; 
So much more cleaning to do in the next week , it isn't even funny . Can't wait til my bday tho , lol . Although , I have a shit ton of work to do at home before anything happens , haha . Text the cell if ya wanna talk . Gonna try to stay off the computer & get some work done around here . :) 
So many thoughts that I can't get out of my head ; I try to live without you , every time I do I feel dead ; I know what's best for me ; But I want you instead ; I'll keep on wasting all my time ; Over & over , over & over ; I fall for you ; Over & over , over and over ; I try not to ; Over & over , over & over ; You make me fall for you ; Over & over , over & over ; You don't even try to ;;
