Forever 21 , I'd kindly like my jacket BEFORE having to go back to Coker , okay ? That'd be just splendid , thanks . 
swimming tiems . 
Fuck a dime , I'm a silver dollar -- holla . 
losing through you what seemed myself , i find selves unimaginably mine ; beyond sorrow's own joys and hoping's very fears 
thinks maybe she needs a re-vamp . 
Everyone's looking at me . I'm running around in circles , baby . 
Fluffy baby mockingbirds in the bush by our porch . 8V 
Happy Daddy's Day 
swimming tiems :3 
Heat Guy J , then the vet . 
thinks it's fucking hot outside . 
really wants an Alias 2 , but isn't sure about this Alltel/Verizon merger ...

is going to shotgun the birds outside her window . 
is probably going swimming , then to a 4th family ge t-t ogether . Happy 4th of July . 
is burnt to a crisp , seriously . Now for some Southern food and then swimming again late in the evening . :3 
is blistered like a lobster from the sun , HOLY CRAP . Good day nonetheless . :) 
When I listen to people tell stories , I often wonder what it's like the have those memories . 
a person doesn't have to be perfect to be exactly what you need 
When I was five years old , my mom always told me that happiness was the key to life . When I went to school , they asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up . I wrote down \happy . \ " They told me I didn't understand the assignment and I told them they didn't " 
at the end of the day , all you have is tomorrow morning 
everyone thinks of changing the world , but no one thinks of changing themselves 
I hope you always find a reason to smile . 
And in the end , the love you take is equal to the love you make . 
Even after all this time , the sun never says to the earth , \You owe me . \ " Look what happens with a love like that . It lights the whole sky . " 
Please remember to call me sometimes for no reason except that you feel me thinking about you , needing your voice . 
All the slammin ' shorties in the house say , \YEAH ! \"" 
I miss the children we once were . 
He who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe is as good as dead ; his eyes are closed . 
There's a little truth behind every just kidding , a little curiosity behind every just wondering , a little knowledge behind every I don't know , and a little emotion behind every I don't care . 
Do you ever wonder if we make the moments in our lives or if the moments in our lives make us ? 
Pain doesn't tell you when you ought to stop . Pain is the little voice in your head that tries to hold you back because it knows if you continue , you will change . Don't let it stop you from being who you can be . Exhaustion tells you when you ought to stop 
There are things you do because they feel right , and they make no sense , and they make no money , and it may be the real reason we are here : to love each other and to eat each other's cooking and say it was good . 
I can see beauty where others see ugliness . That either makes me an artist , or a person with very poor tastes . 
We should get jerseys ' cause we make a good team ... but yours would look better than mine ' cause your out of my league . 
I'll take you with all that you are : with your complications , your pain , your secrets , your past , your longings , and your dreams . I will take you completely , without exemptions . 
You have to make your own little pieces of magic , like the room with the stars on the ceiling where you could be in bed and look up at infinity . 
Anyone can be passionate , but it takes real lovers to be silly . 
i don't want to disappear . i want to stay with you forever . i want to remember your smell , your laugh , your voice : everything . it's so hard to think that one day this will all be gone . it feels like we just got here . 
is amped for the 30th . 
\she'd be ready to pull that bitch's perm right up out her head and slap her with her own < PROPFEMALE > clairborne purse . \"" 
Nobody is perfect until you fall in love with them . 
time for sweepy nights to the sound of the rain . 
Just because today is a terrible day doesn't mean tomorrow won't be the best day of your life . You just have to get there . 
Yes , a liter bottle of Fanta just DID explode all over me and everything else . 
yay for afternoon storm 
the puppies are too adorable . :) 
< PROPMALE > liked to pretend he was a prism . Like things could pass through him and be beautiful . 
is back from the beach ! :3 
Such wilt thou be to me , who must , / Like th ' other foot , obliquely run ; / Thy firmness makes my circle just , / And makes me end where I begun . 
Half empty or half full , it's just a glass of water . 
To be nobody but yourself in a world which is doing its best , night and day , to make you everybody else means to fight the hardest battle which any human being can fight ; and never stop fighting . 
Maybe that's what a person's personality is : the difference between the inside and the outside . 
is chilling with Transformers G1 . :3 
< PROPFEMALE > tales are more than true : not because they tell us that dragons exist , but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten .
