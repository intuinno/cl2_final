We had a scare with our dog Devil today . He couldn't walk or stand , he could only hold his head to the right side , and he was drooling uncontrollably . We called the vet , and two hours later we took him in . By then he was almost back to his normal self . The vet said he must have had a seizure not a stroke , because of how fast he recovered . Devil turns 13 years old this month . We're really worried about him !!

After a long stressful weekend you just want to come home , relax , maybe take a nice hot bath . Not me ..... oh no .... that would be to nice .

Thanks everyone for coming to Aleah's BBQ . We had fun !! It's was a slow start but once it picked up it was great !! We were at the park until it was too dark to see . But most important Aleah had a great time !! Thanks again ! <3 you ALL !! 
almost got T-boned by some IDIOT who ran a red light . If I hadn't of sped up he would have hit us for sure !! He's lucky he didn't , < PROPMALE > was about to jump out of the car while it was still moving and kick his ass , but he drove off too fast !! Scared the hell out of us !!! Poor Aleah had a panic attack and could catch her breath , that scared to hell out of me !!! 
So much to do , so little time !! 
Yay !!! Road trip , wedding , family , quality time with loved ones ....... this is gonna be a great weekend !!!! <3 
We're back !! < PROPFEMALE>'s wedding was perfect , and I had a fun road trip with my hubby !! I'm glad to be home , but I miss everyone !!! It went by way too fast !!!! 
Just closed the bar and now it's time for the gym !! * YAWN * I know I'll feel much better after I get my workout done ; I just need to get back on schedule !! 
Usually when I have a long , irritating day I like to have a glass of red and watch a black and white ..... tonight it's Chianti and Wuthering Heights !! Sooo happy today is over !! 
is felling a little hungover today !!! Now I'm going to watch the Broncos preseason game at < PROPMALE>'s and drink a little more . After tonight I will have had my full for a while !! :) 
is enjoying her last glass of wine and pizza for a while . We're starting our STRICT diet again tomorrow , so tonight we're eating a gourmet veggie from Papa Murphy's and drinkin some wine !! ;) 
Anyone have any advice as to how to plan a Hawaiian Vacation ? Where is the best place to go ? Do we want to take a cruise ? What do you think ? We just don't know where to begin ! 
Wow , what a day !! Time for bed .... finally !! :)

\Razors pain you ; rivers are damp ; acids stain you ; and drugs cause cramp . Guns aren't lawful ; nooses give ; gas smells awful ; you might as well live . \ " \ 
So last night < PROPMALE > asked me why I was in such a weird mood . I didn't even know that I was . Not a bad mood , just a weird mood . Any way I woke up this morning in a very weird mood and I can't seem to shake it . Was it the power of suggestion or was I really in a weird mood all along and never noticed ? Either way , what a weird day !! 
is getting sick just before a weekend trip to Kalispell to see family . And of course I have to work the next two days so there's no time for rest ....... Just my luck !! 
After a long night at work and 2 loads of laundry I'm almost finished packing for our weekend in Kalispell . Unfortunately we have to meet everyone in Idaho Falls at 8 am so I'll barely get any sleep until we're on the road . It's gonna be a long ride tomorrow ..... I mean today !! :-/ 
Having a great time in Kalispell with the fam !!! Went to Glacier Park on the last day of the season .... BEAUTIFUL !!! Went to Moose's Saloon for midnight beer and Pizza ..... DELICIOUS !! And right now we're off to White Fish , but first sourdough pancakes ... YUM !! 
We're home !!! I wish we could have stayed longer , but there is money to be made and beers to be poured tomorrow so here we are .....

Sometimes I really hate Thursdays !! Thank God this one is over !!! Now it's time for a new episode of \It's always < PROPFEMALE > in Philadelphia\ " on the DVR and a dirty martini !!! Goodnight Y'all!!! ;) " 
Watching the Broncos game today just about gave me a heart attack !!! I swear football is going to be the death of me !! 
Why do they call it morning sickness when I have to put up with it ALL DAY LONG ?!?! 
I can't believe that Broncos game earlier !!!! It's really hard to watch now that I can't self medicate with beer !! ;)

I was < PROPFEMALE > excited to get my ultrasound today and hear the baby's heartbeat , but when we got there the doctor was called to the hospital to deliver a baby and we had to reschedule for tomorrow morning . :( Now I have to close the bar late tonight and go to the doctor at 8 in the morning .

Change your profile picture to one of a cartoon from your childhood and invite your friends to do the same . Purpose of the game ? To not see any human faces on Facebook until Monday - only an invasion of memories . FOR THE FIGHT AGAINST CHILD ABUSE - COPY AND PASTE ON YOUR WALL . 
I'm trying to decide if I should get the new profile . To anyone that already has it , do you like it ? Would you recommend it ? 
I'm getting my bags packed and ready to spend some alone time with my sweetie for our Anniversary !! Then Thursday we're off to Washington to spend some time with my family in \Christmas town\ " !! YAY !!!!! "

Heard the baby's heartbeat again today ! :) Doc says baby sounds happy ! Our ultrasound is scheduled for the 7th , then we can find out if it's a boy or a girl . I think it's a boy . What do you think ? 
2010 was a pretty good year ! I have a feeling 2011 will be an even better year ! HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE !!!! <3 
I have to admit I ' m kinda glad this football season is over for me . My team had the worst year I've seen in a long time and I couldn't even drink beer to make it better . Next year will be better ..... I hope ! :-/ 
Taking down the Christmas decorations tonight . The house feels kinda empty . :( 
WOW , I am REALLY starting to look pregnant !! And I've only gained 8 pounds . Perfect !! :) The day after tomorrow is the ultrasound , then we'll know . Boy or girl ? YAY !!

TO NON-PET OWNERS who visit my home . Don't complain about my pets . ( 1 ) They live here , you don't . ( 2 ) If you don't want their hair on your clothes , stay off the furniture . That's why they call it ' Fur'- niture . ( 3 ) Chances are , I love my pets more then I like you . ( 4 ) To you , they are animals . To me , they are family who are hairy , walk on all fours & don't talk back .??? Re-post if you love your pets ?? 
Tha Packers HAVE to win today . They have to , that's all there is to it !!! GO PACKERS !!!!!!!

GOOOOOO PACKERS !!!!!!!!!! KICK SOME BEAR ASS !!! ;) 
I finally got to see Black Swan last night !! It was just as good as I thought it would be !! LOVED IT !!!! 
Whatever you give a woman , she will make it greater . Give her sperm , she will give you a baby . Give her a house , she will give you a home . Give her groceries , she will give you a meal . Give her a smile , she will give you her heart . She multiplies & enlarges what she is given . So if you give her crap , be ready to receive a ton of shit ! Post on your wall if you agree ... hope to see every female re-post :) 
I am totally addicted to Plants vs Zombies on my iPad !! I love it !! 
Chicken in a caper cream sauce , twice baked potatoes , and steamed carrots ...... oOoOoOo I'm soooo hungry , but I can't start cooking til my hubby gets home . * sigh * 
I feel like going out drinking and dancing tonight , but being about 6 months pregnant that's probably not a good idea ! 
Feels like popcorn poppin in my tummy !! Hahaha so cute . I think she has the hiccups . 
Why is it every time I have a lot to do in a day the morning sickness kicks in making it extremely difficult to get it all done ? What a day !!

The ultrasound went great . Baby is healthy ! And yes it is defiantly a GIRL !!! :) We have a DVD of it , but I need to figure out how to get it on here for the Washington family to see . Maybe I'll just email it to ya . 
If you have a wonderful man .... ( or significant other ) , who helps balance your whole world . Who is perfect for you . Who works hard and would do anything for you and you for him . Who makes you laugh and drives you crazy . He is your best friend who you want to grow old with , and who you are thankful for everyday , and you could not live without ... brag about him a little and re-post this as your status :) 
It was over 60 degrees in Boise yesterday ! I was walking around without a coat on ...... it was awesome !! I can't wait for spring/summer !!! 
We finally put together our honeymoon album tonight ....... oh how I miss Hawaii !!!

This is the lonnnnngggggeeeeeessssstttttt night EVER !!!!!!!!!! I don't think it's ever gonna end . God help me !!!!!!!!! 
I finally broke down and bought some maternity clothes . A couple of tops and a pair of jeans . I know I said wouldn't buy any maternity pants but I tried them on and fell in love !! Oh , they are sooo much better than the \rubber band\ " method !!! " 
Getting ready to head up to Idaho Falls to do some shopping and have dinner with the family . I sure wish the sun was shinning though . So when is spring coming exactly ?! * ugh * 
Now we finally have the two things that have been the hardest for us to find , a baby book we both like and the turtle pillow pet that we've been looking for . Everything is coming together nicely !! I can't wait for May !!!! <3 <3 
Just chugged my glucose tolerance beverage ... yum :-/ and it's almost time to go get my blood drawn . I'm so hungry !!! 
I have a very bad case of cabin fever !!! I'm sick of the same old work , home , work , home . I need to go on a road trip , and camping , and swimming in the sun !! June can't get here soon enough ! 
I'm REALLY craving a Guinness today , but I guess I'll go get a Decaf non-fat < PROPFEMALE > latte instead . HAPPY ST . PATTYS DAY EVERYONE !!! :) Have fun drinking without me . :( 
oOoOo ..... homemade banana bread fresh from the oven ..... YUM !!! 
The doctors appointment today went great !!! My glucose levels were exactly where they should be ..... no diabetes ! :) My blood pressure is perfect , and the baby's heart rate is normal . My blood count is a little low so I have to take iron supplements from now until delivery , but other than that everything is perfect !! 
I've been craving seafood for weeks and now , finally , my family's coming down from Idaho Falls to go to Red Lobster . YAY !!! \

It's April fools day ! I can't wait until next month !! Then I can go back to my normal self again ...... only with a little baby ! :)
