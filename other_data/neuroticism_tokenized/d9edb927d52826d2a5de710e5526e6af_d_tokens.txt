i LOVE driving in the sunshine , besties that bring cookie cake to a bar ( < PROPFEMALE > Davidson ) , 4 hour blue baker conversations w/ < PROPFEMALE > McCord , and the prospect of a ' Happy Bday , Whataburger!' date w/ < PROPFEMALE > Driver & < PROPFEMALE > Blackburn :) 
I also L.O.V.E. my beautiful birthday flowers and wonderful man - < PROPMALE > Schulz - who drove to < PROPMALE > at midnight after a full day of rugby to see me the night I got back :) 
Mady Smith is just the best sister ever and I L.O.V.E her ; just wanna wrap her up and snuggle with her forever . 
does love her sister very much but usually doesn't talk about her as if she were a blanket ... Mady ... 
- bugs . Yes , I slept with some in my bed every night in CR .. but now that I'm at home in my apartment , I'd prefer to be sharing my residence with a few less arthropods , thank you . 
loves < PROPMALE > . Very much . And her little sister , too . 
- apparently the more spiders you have , the less big beetles you have .. ( You know , because they catch them and eat them and all ) .. And vice versa . 
is ready for SUCH a good weekend with her KSU friendlies < PROPFIRST > Gustafson , < PROPMALE > Roth , and Nico Roesler !! Oh and to watch < PROPMALE > Schulz crush SFA's rugby team's hopes and dreams :) 
has been reminded by her wonderful bf that her excitement has messed up her mind and her friendlies < PROPFIRST > Gustafson , Nico Roesler , and < PROPMALE > Roth all go to KU . I guess that's ok . JK . Either way , I'm anticipating a wonderful weekend . :) 
is a lil sad her friendsies had to go home so soon already .... but is so glad they made the trip down here . 
has found anotherrr new hobby ... and it's sucking up all her time and money . 
- Who do I think I am , < PROPFEMALE > Crocker ?? Lesson of the day : Do not attempt to \improve\ " baking recipes from \ " America's #1 Cookbook Since 1930 \"." 
had a wonderful weekend celebrating with her family in < PROPFEMALE > :) 
is excited to be accepted into one of her top-choice masters programs :) One down , one to go !! 
- Wishing a Happy 17th Birthday to Mady Smith , mi < PROPFEMALE > hermanita !! :)

Ps - SO excited to finally get to spend a weekend with < PROPMALE > Schulz . See you tomorrow night ! 
is wondering if < PROPMALE > is going to get a piranha named Minion or a chameleon named Pascal . 
Dear MasterCard . I dislike you . You always think I'm a fraud just because I use you for online purchases - such as Crate & Barrel for wedding gifts and CS Utilities - and make it difficult to pay my bills on time . Work on that . Thanks . - < PROPFEMALE >

.. Baby it's cold outside .. ( 14 degrees , to be exact )
