Hoping everyone has a happy new year and makes the most out of 2010 . T_T But that also means ... no more \Change your profile pic to your favorite Pokemon\ " month until next December . * sob * Oh well ... time flies when you sit at the computer on Facebook . xD " 

I am so not looking forward to school tomorrow . < PROPMALE > year's gonna be a bitch ! But , we might all might as well make the best out of it in whatever way we can . And there's always prom to look forward to . =) 
This weekend has been so awesome . FINALLY got my own laptop ! =) And I spent the night at a friend's house last night . I stayed up so damn late . lol XD Not looking forward to school , but the sooner I'm done with it , the sooner it's not my problem . 
I am exhausted beyond belief right now . A weekend of worshipping God takes alot out of you , yet you get alot place into you as well . Hard to tell the difference sometimes . Oh well ... God FTW . 
I love my new photo album . It's < PROPFEMALE > awesome . Everyone , take a look at it when you can . 
My life f***ing sucks right now ... My doctor thinks I have a back condition , and I may have to start wearing some sort of brace . There ain't no way in hell I'm doing something like that . On top of that , it feels like the entire world has turned against me . When life sucks , you might as well fight just to live . :'( 
Finally , first trimester is over ! New classes start tomorrow . I'm both nervous and excited . Here are my classes : 1 . Geometry A , 2 . Honor's English 3B , 3 . Integrated Science 2B , 4 . Math Analysis , 5 . Peer Tutor B . Let me know if you have a class with me . =) 
I just got Naruto Shippuden Clash of Ninja Revolution 3 : Limited Edition for my Nintendo Wiiiiii !!! ( honestly , could the game designers have made the title any longer ? ) >=D Time to make my TV explode with the obliterating force of an awesome Naruto game AND movie ! Everyone , please chip in for my \Help Me Buy a New TV After Mine Explodes from an Orgasm of Naruto Awesomeness\ " fund . xDDDDD WOOHOO !!! " 
I'm so f***ing stoked . Just upgraded from that shitty piece of asshole Windows Vista to the new Windows 7 . xD Oh yeah , I've got my computer running on pure awesomeness now . Crank up the RAM , charge up the hard-drive , I ain't f***ing around no more ! >=D 
I just saw that new movie Avatar with my dad , sis , and bro . Avatar was so epic it seemed almost ungodly . 0_______0 You can feel your brain explode from the sheer awesomeness after the credits start to roll . I recommend that movie to anyone who's thinking of seeing it . > < Now if only this epicness-induced headache would go away . 
My mom woke me up this morning to tell me school got cancelled . For once , being woken up early is a good thing . WOOHOO FOR SNOWDAYS !!!! xD 
I was given an incredible revelation by God tonight . Over these past few years , I've been putting up fronts , acting like things I'm not to impress others . But now I realize that I've done satanic things and was straying from God's image . After having been saved , I wanna devote my life to God again , to showing the world who I truly am . I want to thank all my wonderful friends , even those of you I don't know that well . 
I officially H.A.T.E Honor's English 3B now . :P The Great Gatsby is such a boring book , not to mention it's near impossible to understand . It might be more interesting if Mr. < PROPMALE > chose better \American literature\ " and didn't give us so much work to do over it . >_<" 
Tonight has been simply incredible . I was talking to someone that means alot to me , when I suddenly realized that God had entered my heart and given me a message to share with this significant someone . Long story short , God revealed himself to me tonight , and used me to spread his message of love . The cost of unfinished English homework : bad grades . The cost of doing so because you grew closer to God : priceless . =) 
I'm depressed over the loss of my pet frog , Chocolate . ='( He was a gift from my 1st grade teacher , and I found him .. * ahem * .. unresponsive about half an hour ago . Chocolate wasn't just a pet , he was a memento of happier times , places , and people . I've prayed for his soul .. wherever his soul may be now . :( Prayers and support would be greatly appreciated . 
Working diligently on my English project is kinda fun ... but the fact I'm on Facebook when I should be typing liner notes kinda means I'm procrastinating . Oh well . :P Who else is hoping that we have a snow day tomorrow ? 
I do not like the new Facebook homepage . Everything is cluttered together , and the Live Feed is gone . That was my favorite new feature ! =( The . new . Facebook . sucks . Anyone agree ? 
02/19/10 ... < PROPFIRST > THIS DAY ON YOUR CALENDAR !!! 1 Today , the most epic trolling in all of history occured in our very own < PROPFIRST > High School . Aided only by my Ipod and a set of speakers , I single-handedly RICKROLLED 1st and 2nd period lunch . This is an epic win for trolls across the world ; let it be forever recorded in trolling history . 
WOW ... school got cancelled , and today just so happens to be my 16th birthday . Birthday miracle much , anyone ? ;) Anyways , I'm gonna enjoy my sweet 16 off school . Yay ! :D 
is tired of my inbox being inundated with emails from Facebook . It's the weirdest thing- you turn 16 , and suddenly everyone's posting comments on your wall . What's up with that ? xD 
Okay , so get this . My mom is several thousand in the hole , and had her account frozen . Apparently she hadn't paid the internet < PROPMALE > because of this ... or so she thought . It turns out that the router was unplugged , and I just suffered 3 days of internet withdrawl for nothing . Does life suck , or is this just coincidence ? 
Well , the ACT is tomorrow .... yeah . It's gonna be laaaaame-sauce with a side order of fail fries , and a tall glass of Diet Epic to wash it all down . xDDDDD 
Guess who just got his temps today ? WOOOOOT !!! xD That's right ... The state of Kentucky had better hope I don't get my full license in six months , or they're gonna need more tax revenue for road repairs . MUAHAHA !!! 
Okay ... so I was doing geometry homework , felt bored , and decided to turn on the TV . Just as I'm about to change the channel , I realized that a Pokemon marathon was playing . ( I'm talking about the 1999-technicolor , GOOD Pokemon ) So I just happened to gravitate away from doing my homework to watching the Poke'thon . Does this make me a loser ? lol 
Well , spring break is in full bloom . You think one would enjoy their spring break , right ? WRONG , especially since I had to get my wisdom teeth pulled today . The pain is pretty much gone , but I'm still groggy as a mother****er . <= ( UGH ! Pray for me , people . 
Okay ... in some weird , unexplainable , hell-ishly nightmaric twist , I have been nominated for Prom Court . This makes no sense whatsoever , considering the fact that I am not popular . So why then was I nominated ? Is someone doing this to me as a practical joke ? Regardless , my life is now hell ... the beginning of the end is slowing coming to fruition . T_T FML ! 
IN SOVIET RUSSIA , LIMIT BREAK HIT YOU IN THE HEAD . DA ? 
IN SOVIET RUSSIA , YOU DON'T STIR UP COMMENTS . COMMENTS STIR UP YOU ! 
IN SOVIET RUSSIA , YOU DON'T PWN TEH NOOBS . TEH NOOBS PWN YOU ! ( best Soviet Russia joke evar , right ? ) 
IN SOVIET RUSSIA , YOU DON'T TROLL THE SONICFAGS ... Me : Well , duh , of course not . Stalin ordered the mass genocide of all Russian Sonicfags . The Russian Revolution was just a cover story . xDDD 
In Soviet Russia , you don't summon Yu-gi-oh monsters . Yu-gi-oh monsters summon you ! 
IN SOVIET RUSSIA , YOU DON'T CONTROL FACEBOOK . FACEBOOK CONTROL YOU ! 
I actually cannot believe this ... but I was just Rickrolled ... BY MY F***ING RADIO !!! Yeah , no joke . I was listening to a eurodance radio station via my computer , and I heard a song that I thought was familiar . So I walked over to my computer , realized it was a Rickroll , and sat mortified while the song played . T_T Why me ? GAAAAAAAAHHHHH !!!!! 
Remember when getting high meant swinging on\ 
the playground ? When protection meant wearing a helmet ? Dads shoulders were\ 
the highest place on earth and mom was your hero ? Your worst enemies\ 
were your siblings , race issues were about who ran the fastest , the only\ 
drug you knew was cough medicine , the only thing that hurt you was\ 
skinned knees , and goodbyes only meant until tomorrow ? And we just couldn't\ 
wait to grow up 
would like to say congrats to the class of 2010 . You're all awesome in a special way , and will be missed . I'm honored I knew some of you , such as < PROPFEMALE > Frodge , < PROPFIRST > Wentworth , < PROPMALE > Nicaise , < PROPMALE > Cooper Olano , < PROPFIRST > Eckstein ( love you to death , man ) , and of course , my sister < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Stoddard . Good luck in everything . 
Now that I have Heatherlyn Stickel in my friends list , I can join the tag war against Heatherlyn Stickel . :D 
I have gained a temporary reprieve from the black hole of stupidity that is Kentucky to stay in Montana for 6 weeks . Working to earn some $$$ for a car . Suggestions on a good first car would be appreciated , but may not be taken up for consideration .

Who wants to join me in the tag war against Heatherlyn Stickel ? If you do , I'll post a status thanking you for your efforts . Let's all join together to tag the heck out of Heatherlyn Stickel . 
Is quickly becoming bored of this tag war since I'm the only one tagging Heatherlyn Stickel . But I still find that tagging Heatherlyn Stickel is quite entertaining . :D 
It appears that < PROPMALE > Griffith , my opponent in this tag war , has logged off . So I assume this means that the tag war is either postponed ... or that I've won ! :D YAY ME !!! 
It appears that today is someone .. or rather , something's ... special day . Let's all celebrate Canada's 143rd birthday . ( In retrospect , no one gives a shit- we only care about their bacon and < PROPFEMALE > syrup . LOOOOL ) 
I just wanted to wish a everyone a very happy 4th of July . Don't do anything crazy with those fireworks now . ;) Oh , and keep it legal too . LOL

Copy and paste this into your status if you know or have been affected by someone who needs a punch in the face . People who need a punch in the face affect the lives of many . There is still no known cure for people who need a punch in the face , except a punch in the face . 93% of people won't re-post this . Why ? Because ... they probably need a punch in the face ... 
turned on my TV this morning and saw four words that made my day , \All schools are CLOSED . \"" 
Kids with special needs aren't sick or gross . They only want what everyone wants - To be accepted . Can I make a request ? Is anyone willing to post this for at least one hour ? It is Special Education Week , and this is in honor of all children made in a unique way . You never understand a situation until you're faced with it . 
I now possess the power to update my Fb status using my Wii . FEAR ME , NOOBS ! >:D
