Ah , thank you life , for giving me something to laugh at ... * maniacal giggling * 
It vexes me !! I'm terribly vexed ... 
* sigh * how long until the next HP movie ?

Good to know I wasn't the only one yelling : \This book is RIDICULOUS ! ... And I can't stop reading it !! \"" 
My eyeball made a \splortch ! \ " today ... * shudder * It sounded weird ... The receptionist said I should bring headphones next time . " 
* enjoy the silence ! * 
* ugh * Do you ever stretch your arm straight up , and your shoulder pops -really- loudly , and you have to stop for a few seconds to evaluate whether or not you totally screwed up your arm ? I hate those 5 seconds ... 
Just can't deal yet ... not with this . =*( Was decidedly lucky to have Gramma Pinky - one of a kind , that lady ! =) Wishing I had her strength right about now ...

3 hours later , stillllllll waiting for a nurse to call me back about whether I should come in or not for another eyeball shot . Any later , and I probably won't be able to due to crappy bus schedules . Why did I get up at 7:30 again ? Should've just gone in then , instead of proper procedure of calling first ! -ARGH- . 
Lemon bread - conquered ! XD 
Warm tea , warm cranberry oatmeal , and two very warm kitties sittin ' in some sunspots on the couch with me . Yay winter morning ! =)

Ahh , home for the holidays - falling asleep to the gentle glow of the fireplace , the loveable lapkitty hissing if she isn't fed often enough , the yips and howls of the coyotes out back singing me to sleep ...

All I want for Christmas is ... a cute bronchities . None of those ugly ones , nope ! Just a cute lil one to infest my lungs so's I can call it mine own . =) Ah , how you nestle down in my lungs , depriving me of much-needed oxygen for the sake of your mucus formations . Technicolor coughing to greet me in the morning , and musical breathing to keep me ( and others ) awake at night ... ah . 
May it be a light for you in dark places , when all other lights go out . 
Monday . O.O ' ! 
First day of classes tomorrow ! Meep ! O.O ' 
And so it begins ... on 3 hours of sleep ?! blimey ... 
Day 2 : Must shower , skim over notes from Ch . 1 , figure out a way of somehow printing them off w/o a printer ( since taking them to class might be nice ) , and find nourishment before 11:45 . ... Also , must find rehab for severe FB addiction ... Maybe there's an app or something on here for it ? ;D 
Day Two : Mostly complete . First session of Myology . Phew ! That was a lil rough . The prof was totally cool , but it's definitely going to take some getting adjusted to the immersion into the medical world ! \ 
\ 
Next up : doing some Myo workbook questions , then reading for A&P . 
has decided that the technology meant to help me is a lie . =( Spent 5 hours last night trying to get a portable reader figured out so I can bring it to class . No such luck ! The books I ordered from RFB&D have some sort of copyright protection that makes them unplayable ON THEIR OWN PLAYERS . x.x ?! So beyond irritated ... 
ugh ... calling it quits for tonight . Hopefully I can get the rest of the pages done before class tomorrow . Shouldn't be nearly as much sentence-copying , which'll be nice ... but for now , sleep . 
Day .. Four ? Yeah , four ... Myology , here we go ! I feel a little more comfortable with some of the concepts and terms , and yet horridly behind . wtf ? 
Day Four : Sooo much happier about Myology now ! Got a big ole large print review packet for Tuesday's quiz and did fairly decently on the review quiz today . Maybe , juuust maybe , this stuff might be learnable ! =D 
is too tired for today . =( I keep thinking about going back to bed and seeing if I can hit a \reset\ " button ? " 
Tomorrow's the first big , scary Quiz for A&P ! Also , first day of the Directed Study project . Time to find out where I want to take this new learning ! =) 
Day Six : Anatomy & Physiology Quiz 1 - done ! Pretty easy , too , thankfully ! First session of the Directed Study Project : done ! Doing a solo project centering around how massage therapy might help the marginalized populations of Central New York become reintegrated into mainstream society . Phew ! Did some studying for Myo quiz tomorrow , and -definitely- have to do some more tomorrow ! For now : sleep . 
Day Seven : Myo quiz - done ! * phew * ohmygoodness , I think I overstudied the wrong stuff and forgot the easy . ( Especially the things that weren't even on there ! ) Ah well . In any event , a good initiation into the quizzing world of Myology . Now : a general review of the shoulder bones ( clavicle , scapula , and humerus ) , and a skimming of A&P before early bedtime . Yay ! =D 
Day Nine : Myology quiz grades back in , and I'm kicking my own rear for making such a STUPID mistake ( aside from the rectus femoris vs . biceps femoris question ) . Completely spaced out on something I knew , and can't even explain how or why I might have chosen the answer I did . Argh !! SO frustrated by stuff like that ... Anyhow , overall I guess I can't -really- complain ... got a 93 ... =D 
... REALLY ?! ... * grumble * Unhappy Panda needs to punch things . Repeatedly . Way too tired and inexplicably annoyed to even focus on anything remotely productive . Thinking about a workout before bed , but afraid that'll mess up my sleep . Ideas ? 
Happy Friday ! Wishing I could join the TGIF celebrations , but have to go in tomorrow for Pathology and an Anatomy & Phys quiz . ( ugh .. 8:30 - 4:30 on a Saturday ... definitely a test of willpower ! ... Or constitution/fortitude ... ) In any case , there's way too much to do to be this tired . =( 
Day Ten : Getting a good breakfast really -does- help concentration and general outlook on the day . And now : study ! study ! study ! before early bedtime . 5 am is gonna get here awfully fast . =( 
Woke up 5 minutes ( exactly ) before the alarm . Hoping I passed my Will or Fortitude save ( whichever it is the school is testing ... ) . Bleary , but awake ! Bring on the An & Phys ... Oh yeah ... I got this . * lol * Why is the computer desk so comfy ? XP 
Not sure how I feel about a hazy lack-of-weekend ... One day doesn't quite cut it , and I spent many hours of that one day studying . So many , in fact , that I never got out to get some more study supplies . * ponder * 
Day Twelve : Anatomy & Phys quiz 2 scores back - another 100 ! Rocked that Chemistry unit's socks clear off , I tell ya ! =D Now we're working on Cellular Structure , and today's focus was DNA & RNA . Definitely gonna put to use a Slinky an awesome Mr. < PROPFIRST > Greis gave me for Yule . =D ( I think I can reasonably pass it off as a study aid for this part ... ) Tomorrow - Myology . Tonight : SLEEP ! 
Day Thirteen : ... Can't I have a nap , pleeeease ? =( Even my Vitamin Waters aren't enough to keep me awake/alert . =/ Not rightly sure why I'm so darned tired , but here's hoping I can gear up for some focus in Myology today . 
Neglege : ( NEH-gleh-geh ) ( Latin ) don't bother . <-- LMAO ! =D 
I get to stay up laaaaaaa-aaate ! * heehee ! * ( ... and then study my tail off tomorrow ' n Sunday for a 4-test week ... ) 
head --> desk . * thunk * ... huh ... comfier'n I imagined it'd be ... 
is quite happy to combine Myology studying and some older episodes of RAW & SmackDown . =D Sports massage ftw ! 
There must be sone kinda way outta here ... 
Day ... Seventeen : Anatomy & Phys quiz on Cellular Structure : done ! A little tricksy on the wording . Ok , -very- tricksy in some spots , but I hear that's how it is when you take the Boards , so ... all for the best , right ? I think the majority of the class was too focused on the poor < PROPFEMALE > crying outside to really pay attention to the new Tissue material . 
Day Nineteen : A&P quiz - 97 ! * phew * Gotta cram like crazy for the Myo quiz tomorrow . Flashcards ... I still need to make flashcards ! 
Day Twenty : Myo quiz - ow . Such a headache , but very glad I was so thorough and used every minute possible . I -think- it's around a 90 , but we'll see . At least now I know what to focus on for the bigger unit 1&2 test Tue . Now , to study some A&P ( what we learned so far , that is ) before finishing the unit tomorrow and quizzing Sat . Oh , and toss in some Pathology studying for -that- quiz on Sat , too ... Yay weekend ? =/ 
Day Twenty-One : Learned the A&P quiz tomorrow is open-notes and let forth a grand Huzzah ! .. ok , well , no real huzzah-ing to be heard , but I definitely -thought- it ... Still gotta type ' em up in a nice , concise , coherent format , though , and study for Pathology quiz . 
was shown the awesomeness of SC2 + Bejewelled . ... Soooo cooool !! lol 
Tomorrow is not gonna be pretty ... but it IS coming on pretty soon . To bed , with hopes of remembering stuff during tomorrow's quizzes . 
Day off ! ... was very much awake around 9a , but forced myself to sleep a couple more hours . Now what ? lol Oh , that's right ! Study ! 
hm ... eat dinner or study for Myo ? ... I think maybe both , somehow ? 
Day Twenty-Five : Keeping the Myology average just above 90 , which is nice . Hoping for better stuff in the next unit ( Forearm & Hand ) , but we'll see ... Rather liking the Anatomy unit on Skeletal Structures so far - esp being able to see/touch actual bones . That's pretty darn neat ! =D 
Day Twenty-Six : Doc's appt . went quick ' n easy - no needles , out early enough for some breakfast before class ( spinach & broccoli omelette and some corned beef hash ftw ! ) . Got to poke at some forearm bones in Myo - must find some more to play with . ... I mean ... study . ) 
Day Twenty-Eight : Wow , these long , two-day weekends really throw me off ! ( lol ) And yet they never seem long enough ... Ah well . =) Mr. Beeks isn't feeling too well these last few days , hoping he's gonna pull out of it soon ! 
Oh , whoa-oh , oh , oh-oh-oh-a-oh ... * dance * 
is a tag-carryin ' member of POPWD . Inquire within . >;D 
Stupid dreams ... =( At least when I wake up , things are better than they are in my head . =) And , there's French Toast ! =D 
Massage study at the Lube ! ( teehee ) 
Day ... Thirty-Seven : ( had to count back from 29 .. wow ! ) So far , so good . Did way better on the Myo quiz than expected , and got my lowest A&P grade yet , but can't rightly complain about that one , either , since there was minimal studying involved . Tonight , we celebrate with Chinese ! .. and then studying for Pathology . =) 
DA2 ... gahh , can't wait !! Might actually have to * coughcough * be a little sick * cough * and stay home one day ... O; ) 
Second day of a \long\ " two-day weekend ... Why does it feel like I need at least 3 more to get all the work/chores/activities I have left done ? Must find more hours in the day ... \ 
asks : \Have you downloaded your DA2 demo yet ? \ " ;D " 
Day Forty-One : First day of massage school wherein I received a massage ! Hoo-ray ! =D My right shoulder is decidedly happier for it , as well as all the other muscles that've been in much need of some rest & restoration . =) ( And yes , I'm drinking plenty of water !! ) =D 
Day Forty-Two : Yep , there are muscles in the back . Yep ... Ooh , look , a mall ! =D 
mrant . 
Day Forty-Four : BRAAAINS ! ( Specifically baby brains ! Apparently babies make fantastic subjects of study , and are kinda funny , too . ) 
Day Forty-Five : There's more than one way to have a hernia , and none of ' em seem good . ( I don't care how much something can \just be popped back in\ " ... just doesn't seem right !! lol ) " 
Migraines again ... And I'd been about 15 or so years w/o ' em , too . =( Really hoping I can get this misery kicked way quicker than when I had them as a kid . 
I <3 my OSTM folk !! =D \You're not a bitch ! \ " * teehee ! * lols !! " 
Day Forty-Eight : 4 pathologies in 3 hours . ( And no , I don't remember what they are right now ... ) I DO remember that the human body can produce about 2 pints of sweat in an hour when working at < PROPMALE > levels , that we are taller in the morning than at night ( thank you , gravity ) , and the ( I think made-up ) phone number we were told on Monday as an example of things some people don't remember ( i.e. strings of < PROPFIRST > ) . >.< ? 
Day Forty-Nine : ( sort of ) First call-in-sick day . =( Migraine all night ( idk if it's a plural or just one really long one in tidal pattern . They're all over the same area this week , so it's kinda hard to distinguish one from another . ) Took 2 Imitrex , and an hour or so after the 2nd , was finally able to lay down w/o feeling like the world was crashing into another planet . Then my alarm went off . 
Live it , \ 
Love it , \ 
Lube it ! \ 
;D I was in my happy place tonight . Just sayin ' . =D 
DA2 !! 
So ... roughly two weeks of migraines ( mostly hitting me at night and early morning hours , but lingering throughout the day this last week ) that meds really aren't touching . Heat didn't do much , cold makes it hella worse , and sleep is getting scarce . Do I : go to my doctor and/or see about finding a neurologist or continue to try & wait it out ? 
Tired , moderately annoyed , headache-y , and so not ready for tomorrow . Harrumph . >.< 
Day Fifty-Five : Happy Pi Day ! Began today with about 3 hours of sleep , a shot in the butt & a CT scan . Followed that up with an A&P quiz about the brain ( hah , two brain tests in one day ! ) and then a final presentation for DSP . No more DSP classes ! I'm gonna miss seeing everyone , but also gonna like having some free Monday nights now . Tomorrow : Myology 1 Final ... meep ! 
Day Fifty-Nine : Finished off Myology 1 earlier this week with a ferocious 88 ! ( ok , so not very rawr-tastic , but I'll take it ! ) Now just gotta crack down on A&P and Pathology for next week's quizzes & finals . For tonight : head , meet desk . It's nap time . =) 
Day Sixty-One : Full day of A&P and Path ! Found out a few things : 1 ) The Path quiz I was stressing over b/c I didn't recall discussing a fair amount of the info was causing stress for a reason : I had next week's quiz ( lol ! but was able to ace it * phew ! *) 2 ) I need to make more fruit pizza ( though maybe keep the bananas off til just before serving ... 3 ) Food ( especially rumballs ! ) makes Saturday classes awesome ! =D 
A lil sad I missed out on the super-full < PROPFEMALE > , but feeling amazingly better after about 15 hours of sleep ... 
Day Sixty-Two : Was called into the Director's office * dramatic pause with some equally-dramatic music * to discuss what they can help me with in regards to making the headaches go away ! ( Awww !! =D ) First order of business : increase notes & test fonts from 36 to 55+ ( yes , that -is- ginormous text , but it is < PROPFEMALE > much easier to read ! ) Second : Get . More . Massages . ( lol ; how could I possibly say \no\ " to that ? ) So yay ! =) " 
>.<* 
Sorely in need of some away time ... 
It's 7:10 pm . Too early for bed ? I think not !! ^.^ 
* ponder , ponder ... * With a universe full of infinite possibilities , how does anyone choose just one ? >.> ? 
So ... apparently brakes need brake fluid in order to brake ... -.-* Ah well , we're home , safe ' n sound . Won't be going back in for my student exchange though tonight . =( Poops . 
>.> mrant . 
Brownies at midnight . ^.^ 
Quickly ! To the Bat-Cape ! ... -ve . * dashes off * 
Day Seventy-Nine : Back into the swing of Myology ! Working with muscle physiology for this week - doesn't seem too bad . =) Definitely looking forward to some student exchange time tomorrow , though ! * glee * Have a meeting with my new CBVH counselor Thursday to discuss where I might want to take all this new-found knowledge ! ( i.e. how much school do I -reeeally- want to go through ? ) 
Day Eighty : It's a good thing I'm not hoping to be a heart surgeon ! That thing is freakin ' complex ! The brain , I get . The endocrine system , I get . The heart ? Nope . Not happening . 
^.^ Was up at 8 but didn't get out of bed til 12:30 . Yay ! * feelin ' lucky & loved ! * Hoping to get up to Watertown this weekend for a nice 3-day stretch . Keep the fires burning , Mom ! =D 
Why must things be so complicated ...? >.< ( and bloody expensive ... grr . ) 
I hope ' nip takes away pain for kitties ... Totally tromped on Kaney's lil paws and he was limping a bit . Hid away in the closet , and came out with a ' nip toy . He's a mean drunk , but at least he's looking like there's no pain anymore ... 
... I guess moving means I should pack things , huh ? O.o 
I <3 storms . I don't <3 dropping my phone in a puddle of water . =.=* Might be a lil off the grid for a while because of it . 
Severe pokey trauma . * nod * Be aware . 
There's a fine line between being nice and being a doormat . >.> Wish I knew which side I was on ... =.=' Maybe it'll help with the zen training & learning to let go . ( Too bad that training directly contradicts everything my Sith-y soul stands for ... lol . ) 
You can't pick your family , \ 
But you can DEFINITELY pick your fomites ! \
