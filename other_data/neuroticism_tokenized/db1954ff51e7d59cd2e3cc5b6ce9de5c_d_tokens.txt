Twas the morning of Chrismtas and all through the house , not a creature was stiring not even a mouse , when the alarm rang at 6 am . < PROPFIRST > and I sprang to our feet to see whats the matter . The kitchen was quite the stove was asleep the refrigerator was cooling the food for the day ! And to our surprise the refigerator door flew open and the food came flying out . 
The breakfast was to be made and delivered to mom and dad by 7 am . What a morning this has been with a surprised mom and dad to have a complete breakfast ( bacon , egss , sauage , ham , hasbrown , biscuits , coffee , juice and milk ) , all delivered without any request ! What a great Christmas moring this was then the presents were opened !!! Now it is time for a nap !!!....... < PROPFEMALE > Chrismtas , love , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > 
Life can be fun , hard and discouraging . When you mess up you try and fix it , you apologize for what you have done , even ask for forgiveness and try to make a means . But , if the person doesn't respond and will not forgive you , what do you do ?? When they will not forgive you then where do you go ? How do you fix it the problem ? Any advice ... 
Good Luck to the CHS Band kids in Albuquerque for All State this week !!!! 
Let it snow , let it snow , let it snow ....... We need the moisture , just not the ice ..... Oh , an maybe even a day off from work ..... 
What a great day , snowed in with family ! My husband is teaching < PROPFIRST > to cook old fashion fried chicken , with white country gravey , green bean cassarole and twice baked potatos . I'm glad we are snowed in ....... :) 
What a nice day it was . Working on a project for the High School Musical my son is in then coming home to a wonderful home cooked meal my wonderful husband made . Spending the evening with my 2 favorite guys .... What a great night .... 
Who I amAll things work together forthe good of those who love the Lord and are called according to His purpose . All things- not some- not just the good things I do - not just the bad things that happen to me without my choice - all things ... 
Remeber when you were a teenager , life was good until you began dating ...... Then all the drama , he said , she said .... Well , the problems in teenage dating are still around ...... You would think that since the make a book on how to have and raise a baby thru toodler years , that they would put out a book on teenage dating and hormones ... 
Go Colts and Good Luck to < PROPMALE > !!!! 
What a day ! I know that God only gives you what he knows you can handle , but sometimes , I wish I wasn't that strong . Today , I'm diagnosed with pink eye-then no pharmacy in town has the medication , so tomorrow it will be in . Then my mom is told they think she is having a stroke and sent her to Lubbock ( thank you God ) , then on Tuesday my Father-in-law is having brain surgery . It is only Sunday . 
Just found out-mom only had her potassium bottom out , which you need that in your body for your heart to keep pumping ... NO stroke .. She should be released from the hospital tonight ... Hope everyone week is good . 
I woudl like to thank everyone that express concerned for my mother .. We really appreciate it .. She is home and doing well . Her potassium was very low , and if this gets to low if can cause your heart to stop . Hers was close to that , so No stroke . Thanks again .

Getting ready for a trip to Tennessee for spring beak ! Get to visit all the cousins and my Grandparents , which makes it my son's Great Grandparents . I just hate to have to drive over the Mississippi river in Memphis . I swear that bridge moves ! Have a Great Spring break everyone !!!! 
Made it to Conway , Arkansas . Gloomy weather today , but enjoyable time with < PROPFIRST > . We both figured out that we don't like driving in Oklahoma City . I dread the thought of Little Rock and Memphis . I don't like big cities and the crazy drivers . Can't wait to see and spend time with family ! 
We actually made it home . What a long trip . We went to Mississippi , Tennessee , Missouri , Arkansas , Oklahoma , Texas and then here .... It was a long 15 hours yesterday . Glad to be home , thanks for all the well wishes for our trip .. 
This is adds to the memories of the wonderful trip ... < PROPFIRST > and I just got back from the doctor .. I have bronchitus and < PROPFIRST > has a Sinus infection .... 
I can NOT believe that it is snowing ... What happened to spring and the 70 degree temps we had ? :( 
My son thinks I need to change my status , as today was 70 degrees not snowing .. What a beautiful spring day .... 
Just posted pictures of the Tennessee trip ! What a beautiful day here , gonna be 77 degrees ! yeah !!!

I want to CONGRATULATE my son ( < PROPFIRST > Hays ) for making the Drumline playing Tenors for the ENMU Marching band as a Freshman ... We are so proud of you !!! 
It is official , the kids are in college at ENMU ! No it's not that far , the point is they aren't home anymore , they are now adults . ENMU Dawg Days was fun or at least the BBQ and Pep Rally , where < PROPFIRST > performed for the first time as a ENMU Freshman on the Drumline ..

Excited about ENMU football game tonight , get to watch < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE > on Drumline and all the other Clovis kids that made the ENMU band perform for the first home game ... Just hope it doesn't rain until after the game .... 
Went to ENMU game last night , game was supposed to start at 6 pm . We finally got in the stadium after a delay , get sat down , then the horns go off for lightening in the area , this happened about 4 times last night so we go under the bleacher or to the cars , About 10:30 halftime . Band sounded great , we left the ball field at 11:00 score was 38-21 , heard that in the 4th was 52-21 .. Go Greyhounds . What a night . 
So proud of my son , he pledged a fraternity last week and then made wind symphonic for ENMU . He is enjoying college , which is good ... Marching band sounded great Saturday night .... 
I'M A HANDFUL !!! Unfortunately most women won't repost this . I'm strong\ 
willed , independent , and outspoken , I make mistakes , I am sometimes out\ 
of control and at times hard to handle - but if you can't handle me at\ 
my worst then you sure don't deserve me at my best . If you're\ 
a ...... HANDFUL ... then post this on your status ... I DARE U2 
I do not understand why people post there every move on FB . Don't you think that could hurt you in the long run . What if someone followed your every move and wanted to hurt you ... So , I guess the question is . Why do people post everything , ie . stops while traveling , stops to go to the bathroom , fast food joints they stop , I just don't understand . especially when it is complete details as to the name and city your at . 
Why is it , that your children don't understand that know matter how old they get you will always worry about them .. Mom tells me that often ... One day my son will understand that ...

What a long day , first in the dentist office with my husband 2 1/2 hours for root canal , then come home to get a phone call , father-in-law having a procedure done at the Heart Hospital at 7 am Texas time tomorrow morning . Long day even longer tomorrow . 430 am will come early .... 
Just go back from the Veteran's Parade . I am ashamed of Clovis for not supporting the parade like they should . Thanks to the Freedom Riders , Patriot Guard and local riders for escorting the parade . The Jr. High bands sounded great playing patriot music . Why didn't the high school band play . We say we support our veteran's but the show of support in and at the parade doesn't show it . 
My\ 
husband has made me laugh , wiped my tears , hugged me tight , watched me\ 
succeed , seen me fail , cheered me on , told me the truth , kept me\ 
strong , lifted me up and torn me down in the same breath ! My husband is\ 
a promise from God that I will have a friend for life . Put this a your\

For those of you in Clovis that remember or know < PROPFIRST > Hardegree , he is in the hospital in Clovis at Plains Regional Medical Center in room 604 , he might get out Monday ( not sure ) , he has Stage 4 Cancer and would love to see old friends . His cell number is 575-777-1762 . Please keep < PROPFIRST > and his family in your prayers . Thanks 
I\ 
want to wish all a very happy Thanksgiving . May we all remember with\ 
gratitude all the blessings we have received and not forget our\ 
soldiers , sailors , Marines , Air Force , and Coast Guard who stand post\ 
around the world and can't be with their families . 
We do not stop playing because we are old ; we grow old because we stop\ 
playing . Lighten up and play . Remember , you are God's child , so it's ok\ 
to be silly , be curious , be fun .

Have a great week and God Bless everyone . 
Today was very eventful . Went to Lubbock with my husband at 6 am to finish Christmas shopping for the Children Christmas Party next week . The Children home called me and said they received 6 new children last night and 1 more will come on Monday . Then 7 wonderful angels came to help , and now all 7 children will have gifts along with < PROPFEMALE > gifts . God only gives us what we can handle .. 
I don't understand what are the < PROPFIRST > # for ? 
The count down begins !!! 2 day til the Christmas party .. My nerves are bouncing , Just want it to be special and wonderful for the children .. We have many surprises this year . Just to see the children of all ages smile and enjoy themselves for 5 hours is just a blessing , no matter what is going on in life , this party and the magic of the time season is just magical . 
One more day , I have so much to do and I am affraid not enough time to do it in . However , I am getting excited .. Thanks for all the help and support ..

Starting a new chapter in my life .. It is exciting , but scary . Let's go world .. 
It has been said that everlasting friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question the friendship . These types of friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been or how faraway they live , and they don't hold grudges . They understand that life is busy but you will ALWAYS love them .. you know who you are ... Re-post if you have @ least 1 of these friends . 
Well today officially ended a chapter in my life , but I am looking forward to the next adventure . I worked with good friends and good people and I will miss them , however , I know that new friends and new people are on the horizon .. 
There comes a time in life , when you walk away from all the drama and people who create it . You surround yourself with people who make you laugh , forget the bad , and focus on the good . So , love the people who treat you right . Forget about the ones who don't . Life is too short to be anything but happy . Falling down is part of LIFE ... Getting back up is LIVING !!!!!! RE-POST IF YOU AGREE . 
A friend of mine posted this and Like it so I borrowed it ... As a parent , there are two things you MUST provide your children ... Those two things are roots to keep them grounded , and wings so that they may soar . 
Do you every have one of those days , that you need to get things done , however , you just don't want to do anything ... :( Happy Friday !!! 
why is it that one day when you look your child is little .. and the next time you look they are grown ... Dang it I want my little boy back . 
What crazy weather ... Hope we get snow ... Then I can handle to cold ... NO SNOW don't like cold weather .... My ideal weather is 50 - 75 fall and spring ..... However , we are alive !! So the day is good ... 
Congratulations to our son for making Wind Symphony for the spring ... We know you could do it ..... 
OK , I am a little confused ... The Super Bowl is indicating that this is Super Bowl 45 . The first was in 1967 ... Well , I was born in 1967 and I am only going to be 44 this year .... Someone can't add and it isn't me .... Trust me I know how old I am .... Go Steelers !!! 
No matter how old your child or children are , you will always worry about them .... Sometimes , mine thinks I worry to much about him . I tell him it's a mom thing wait till you have children one day and you will see .... 
Had a good day today . My son came home , we got him new tires for his truck , went to a wedding and reception with him and his girlfriend , had good food and had fun dancing or trying . The chocolate covered strawberries we good and the wedding was beautiful ... Thanks for a good night ... 
What a great Valentines day ( early ) , went to church then went to lunch with my husband , son , parents and < PROPFIRST>'s girlfriend . Had Cattle Barron in Portales , it was great , I love the salad bar ... and I am stuffed . Now I am baking for the office tomorrow .. What a great day .. Happy Early Valentines day , everyone ... 
Happy Valentines Day , everyone .. Have a great day ... 
Had lunch today with mom and my favorite son and his girlfriend .. It was a good day . 
I've slept with a baby on my chest . I've kissed boo boos and mended broken hearts . I've been puked on , peed on and spent sleepless nights in the rocking chair . But I wouldn't have it any other way . I don't have the perfect body , but when I look in the mirror I see a MOM ! There is no greater honor or blessing . I love you < PROPFIRST > .. 
Had a good evening , visited with an old friend for couple hours , talked about good times , high school , dragging main st. and of course people we know . Then of course we went an made one drag down main for ole time sake . Thanks < PROPMALE > , I really enjoyed our visit . 
< PROPFIRST > Sheen 47 , is all over the news because he's a celebrity drug addict . While < PROPFIRST > Wilfahrt 31 , < PROPFIRST > Tabada 21 , < PROPMALE > Hizon 22 , Chauncy Mays 25 are all soldiers who gave their lives this week with no media mention . Honor THEM by re-posting this status . 
Hi Lord , its me ... things are getting bad here , gas prices are too high , no jobs , food and heating cost too high . I know some have taken you out of our schools , government & even Christmas . But Lord I'm asking you to come back and re-bless < PROPFEMALE > , we really need ya . Thanks Lord , I Love you . ( Please Re-Post if you Love your Lord and want him back in Our Schools , our Government and Our Christmas ) 
Well it's about 4 am and I can't sleep . I see problems with this picture . 
To my child , I make mistakes , sometimes more than I would like to admit , being a Mom . But I will always be there for you , to hear you , to cheer you , to laugh or cry with you , to protect you with my life , and to love you for eternity with all my heart ! No one on earth will ever love you more than I do , I'm your Momma ! Re-post if you have children , young or adult , that will always be in your heart ! 
Why is it . You find out that your child is upset , you as a parent want to help , but you can't reach them to talk to them , neither by phone , text , fb .. That really sucks , as a parent you just want to make sure they are ok , and with the day that my son has had , I just want to hear is voice or even just a text would be fine ... 
Today is a new day . Hope that it is gets better then the last couple of days have been . To my children - < PROPFIRST > and Andi , I love you and things will be alright . Just think Spring break if only 1 more day away .. Have a great day .. 
A mother thinks about her children day and night , even when they are grown . A mother loves her children in a way that they will never understand . A mom will be there for her children when no one else will . A mom would take a bullet , stand in front of a train , and ask God to take her instead of her child . If you have a child/children that you love ... as much as I love mine , post this as your status . ? 
What a day , worked then drove < PROPFIRST > to Lubbock to catch his plane . Ask him where he wanted to eat ... Hooters .. I have never eaten there before , but the phyllie steak and cheese sandwhich was great . They were very busy at 9 pm , but good food .. Enjoyed spending time with < PROPFIRST > and visiting . 
Figured out why I'm fluffy ! The shampoo I use in the shower that runs down my body says \For extra volume and body\ " . I'm going to start using \ " Dawn\ " dish soap . It says \ " Dissolves fat that is otherwise difficult to remove\ " . Repost if you have the same issue ;-) " 
I PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES OF < PROPFEMALE > AND TO THE REPUBLIC FOR WHICH IT STANDS , ONE NATION UNDER GOD , INDIVISIBLE , WITH < PROPFEMALE > AND JUSTICE FOR ALL ! MY GENERATION GREW UP RECITING THIS EVERY MORNING IN SCHOOL WITH MY HAND ON MY HEART . THEY NO LONGER DO THAT FOR FEAR OF OFFENDING SOMEONE ! LET'S SEE HOW MANY < PROPFEMALE > NS WILL RE-POST THIS & NOT CARE ABOUT OFFENDING SOMEONE . 
Family in for the weekend . Get to throw birthday party for my brother and nephew . Then me and my niece get to shop and decorate .

I have a personal reason for ASKING if everyone could please put this as their status for 1 hour . I know the ones that will !! Think of someone you know or love who has had cancer . My wish is that in 2011 a cure will be found . Will you post it for 1 hour . Do it for all !! There are too many to mention who have fought and are fighting . I hope to see this in the status of all my friends 
Eleven years ago , I met the man I married ten years ago . Had an enjoyable night , went to Leal's for dinner and since he tried several times to call his favorite florist and the phone was busy , he didn't get to send me any flowers . First time in 10 years no flowers on our anniversary , so while we were shopping in Albertsons , he bought me a dozen red . They were beautiful .. Thank you ... Hears to another ten plus !!!
