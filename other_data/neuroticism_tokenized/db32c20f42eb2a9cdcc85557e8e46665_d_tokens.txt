Still an awesome movie ! 
So I went to update Firefox and Chrome ... took about two seconds ... \ 
Went to download IE9 about an hour ago and I'm still not even halfway there -.-

I kept coming across a spanish word I didn't know in a book Ms Bishop gave me , so I looked it up . \ 
Imagine my surprise when I find out what \Chinga tu madre ! \ " means ... xD " 
according to what little i know of the bible , no one can know when the world will end except god . \ 
so if we keep expecting it to end , we can prolong the universe infinitely . trolling god ? yes please ! \ 
on the other hand , i might wake up tomorrow and find quite a few people missing ( me and surbhi will still be here at least haha) ! \ 
//it is way too early for me to be rambling this badly , i do apologize .
