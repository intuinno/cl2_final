Leave me one memory that you and I had together . It doesn't matter if you knew me a little or a lot ... anything you remember . Dont send a message , just leave a comment below this post . Next , repost this in your status , and see how many people leave you a memory 
On the hunt for a job , it would be so bad if it wasnt raining with < PROPFIRST > force winds ALL Day ! 
If you have a best friend who will drop everything for you , be there for you through thick and thin , love you unconditionally , even with your faults and be the first one there to pick you up when you fall and give a much needed dose of reality and a swift kick in the butt if necessary . post this as your status . He or she will know who they are ! 
Looking for work , still nothing , getting irritated and RAWR !
