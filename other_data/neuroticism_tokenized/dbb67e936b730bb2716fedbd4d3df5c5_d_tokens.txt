G'night all , though I probably < PROPFEMALE > around facebook a few minutes before getting off . Had a movie day today , while I didn't finish The Dark Knight , it was definitely good . Daybreakers ... wait for DVD . Sensitive stomachs needs to avoid it too . 
This whole social life thing is so new for me . Last night had a date with a guy from my class ( the same one who brought me to the movies ) . Went bowling and finished Dark Knight , and saw the six episodes out right now of the Astonishing X-men . Today is quiet day at home playing on facebook and Wow . 
I love my mom ! For all of you that aren't too proud to say thank you to your moms for helping you be the great person you are today ... please copy and paste to your profile ! I expect to see this many times on my < PROPFEMALE > !?

Copy and paste to your status if you're a SAINTS FAN ! WHO DAT 
My wish for 2010 is that people will understand that children with disabilities do not have a disease ; children with disabilities are not looking for a cure , but for ACCEPTANCE ......... 93% of people will not copy and paste this , WILL YOU be one of the 7% that posts this as your status for at least an hour . 
Go to urbandictionary.com and look up your first name . Copy this in your status and what Urban Dictionary says about your name in the first comment 
WHO DAT THAT ARE THE SUPERBOWL CHAMPIONS ! THE SAINTS , THAT'S WHO !?? 
Morning ya'll! 
Happy < PROPFIRST>'s Day ya'll! 
Well just a recap : Passed , a health care plan written by a committee whose chairman says he didn't understand it , passed by a Congress that exempts themselves from it , signed by a President who smokes , with funding administered by a Treasury Chief who didn't pay his taxes , and to be overseen by a Surgeon General who is ... obese ! Better yet , is to be financed by a country that is broke . 
Bra colors made FaceBook news BUT WILL THIS ? Lets support our Firefighters , Paramedicsand Police . If you support our Firefighters , Paramedics and Police then please post this on your status and leave it there for one hour . There should be no excuses from anyone !! This should appear in everyone's status ! God bless our Firefighters , Paramedics and Police !! 
Thank you everyone for the well wishes !!! It means alot , probably more then you know . 
Hi everyone , I want to warn people before I start , but I no longer have the time to play the facebook games like I used to , so I'm pruning my friends list . If I don't know you outside of games , then don't take it personnally but you will be removed . Thank you for understanding . 
Let me get this straight : < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is getting his 8th divorce , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > is possibly getting married for a 9th time , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > and Tiger Woods are screwing EVERYTHING , yet the idea of same-sex marriage is what is going to destroy the institution of marriage ?? REALLY ??... Feel free to copy and paste if you agree

Please post this .. to your profile for 1 hour and say a prayer for that little girl and give everyone you know the opportunity to do 
A signature I saw on a forum , that I thought was true . \ 
\ 
To some , blessings as beautiful gifts dropped in your lap in perfect packages . To me , it's more like God handing you a paper clip , a shoehorn , 2 gumdrops and a spork , with a note that says , Be creative . 
\An insincere and evil friend is more to be feared than a wild beast ; a wild beast may wound your body 
Good Morning all .... gotta love morning classes . But I an happy that my grandma could make it in . Also , very belated Mother's day to all the moms , I didn't get on much yesterday . Sorry !

One died for your soul , the other for your freedom . If you agree ... copy\ 
and paste in your status ... 
I'm a bitch !!! Unfortunately most women won't repost this ... I make mistakes , I'm crazy , occasionally out of control , I'm emotional , and at times I'm hard to handle - but if you can't handle me at my worst , you sure as hell don't deserve my best ! ( If you're a bitch , repost this ! I dare you ... ) 
Happy Fourth of July Ya'll! 
Okay confession time : For all that I've made fun of Twilight , I finally broke down and watched the first movie ...... And I really really enjoyed it . Get me the Team < PROPFIRST > shirt ! 
* Sniff Sniff * Vacation time is over and today is the first day back to school . Already finished my first class of the semester in fact . 
Registered for classes next quarter ... am I the only one , or do others prefer to do it on their own rather then with a counsler ? 
* crossing fingers * I cooked dinner tonight tonight .. homemade chicken nuggets , < PROPFEMALE > mustard dipping sauce and sweet patatoe fries ( bag from store ) . Hope it all comes out good . 
I like it on the floor . :) 
There is only one sin , only one . And that is theft . Every other sin is a variation of theft .. \ 
When you kill a man , you steal a life . You steal his wife's right to a husband , < PROPMALE > his children of a father . \ 
When you tell a lie , you steal someone's right to the truth . \ 
When you cheat , you steal the right to fairness . \

A politician sees his family everyday ; a deployed soldier once in 6 months . A politician flies 1st class ; a soldier flies in a C130 . A politician's pension is not reduced ; a soldier's is clawed 65% . A politician enjoys an expense account ; a soldier must justify extra rations .

Yayy , back home again , hope everyone had a good thanksgiving ! 
You know something , I see alot of talk about watching movies and tv shows on Ipods and phones , and that is all good and dandy . But I see two big problems with it . A : the screen is too small ( imo ) to really see anything , and B : how do you watch a show or movie with somebody else ? 
Change your FB profile picture to a cartoon from your childhood . The goal ? To not see a human face on FB till Monday , December 6th . Join the fight against child abuse & copy & paste to your status to invite your friends to do the same . 
What is this number game that I've seen people talking about ? It doesn't require math right ?! 
Will you all be willing to donate your status for just a few minutes to HONOR a fallen < PROPFEMALE > who's just passed away while serving our country ... \ 
USMC Cpl . < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > died Dec 6 while serving in Afghanistan and leaves behind a wife and a newborn son named in his honor , who was born approx . 24 hours after new of his death ... \ 
God Bless . ...... RIP UMC < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > !! 
Okay , I know this might be a surprise to everybod ) , but I've been doing alot of thinking . I waste alot of time doing the games on FB , time I would rather spend doing my writing , improve on things I need for school , etc . Despite all the time I've put in and the games I've started recently , I'm quitting them all . I will also unfriend everyone who I friended just for the games . 
Anyone thinking about New Year resolutions ? Or waiting til after Christmas to do that ? 
One thing I've noticed since quitting all the FB games , I can keep up with the news feed < PROPFEMALE > much more easily . 
And Christmas vacation starts ..... NOW ! 
Okay , just throwing this out there to get some ideas . Usually the ID program at my school have a bake sale each quarter to raise some money for the program . I found out from the head of the bake sales that we won't be able to do them anymore so we're having a meeting on the first week of next quarter to figure out a new plan . 
Finished my christmas shopping for now . That's the good thing about having little to no money , it makes it easier to shop in a sense . That and having a short Christmas list . 
Damn , no lunar eclipse for me , I jsut walked the dog around and I tried to look for the < PROPFEMALE > , no go . :( I saw the < PROPFEMALE > earlier so I think cloud cover is to blame . Guess it's all good though , since I'm tired as all get out . 
Does anyone eat congealed salads , yanno the ones that are made with jello and stuff in the jello , including cream cheese and mayo ? Or is it just for looks ? My grandma sent us a copy of her church's cookbook and they have a whole section of these ... which just sound yuck/ . 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas Everybody ! 
DID U KNOW ?? It takes 7 sec for food to pass from mouth to stomach . A hair holds 3kg . The length of a penis is 3x the length of the thumb . The femur is as hard as concrete . A woman's heart beats faster than a man's . We use 300 muscles just to keep our balance when we stand . The woman has read this entire text . The man is still looking at his thumb .
