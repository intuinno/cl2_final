Whatever you give a woman , she will make it greater . Give her sperm , she will make a baby . Give her a house , she will give you a home . Give her groceries , she will make a meal . Give her a smile , she will give you her heart . She multiplies and enlarges what she is given . So if you give her any crap , be ready to receive a ton of s --- . Post to your profile if you agree

OFFEND and INSULT her , there's a man flirting with her and reminding her\ 
how wonderful she is . While you HURT your woman , there's a man wishing \ 
he could make love to her . While you make your women CRY there's a m.an \ 
stealing smiles from her . Post this on your wall if you're against \

Thanks for all the Birthday wishes ! I'm having a fantastic time and will post the pics once i get back home ! Going to \The CSI Experience\ " tomorrow where we get to actually solve the crime ! So far one of the best vacations ever ! " 
Wow I'm having a blast not missing the snow or cold at all !! so good to get away & spend time with my friends !! 
Can't believe my vacation is almost over already ! I've had such a great time with < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > & < PROPFEMALE > , great hosts ! I think I've seen almost all there is to see in Vegas , lots of amazing things to be seen & experienced ! More fun than any one person can imagine !

I have a personal reason for ASKING if everyone could please put this as their status for one hour . I know my family will . Think of someone you know or love who has had cancer . My prayer is that in 2011 a cure will be found . Will you post it ? Just one hour . Do it for all of us . There are too many to mention who have fought and are fighting it . I hope to see this .... in the status of all my friends 
tired but can't seem to fall asleep tonight ! typical ! 
DEPRESSION is not a sign of weakness , it is a sign that you have been trying to ... be strong for too long . Put this as your status if you know someone who has or has had depression . Will you do it and leave it on your status for at least an hour ? Most people won't , but it's mental health week and ... 1 in 3 of us will suffer at some point . 
When you < PROPFEMALE > the Bible , Satan gets a headache . When you open it , he collapses . When he sees you reading it , he faints . When he sees you living it , he flees . And just when you're about to re-post this , he'll try to discourage you . Any takers ? 
we all have at least 200 friends on facebook , but when it comes 2 needing a friend 2 talk 2 how many will actually be there 4 you ? I can guarantee not even 10 of your facebook friends will like this ! Like this status if you`ll be there 4 me ... SET THIS AS YOUR STATUS AND SEE WHICH FRIENDS ARE THERE FOR YOU ! 
Good morning world , hope it turns out to be a < PROPFEMALE > \warmer\ " day since we are supposedly in the spring season !!! " 
i've had several conversations recently about relationships & what women want ... well most women i know want to be happy , they want a man who loves God , does what he says he's gonna do , a man who treats her w/ respect & who will listen to the answer of a question he has asked ! 
long day !! i'm beat & hoping i can sleep tonight !
