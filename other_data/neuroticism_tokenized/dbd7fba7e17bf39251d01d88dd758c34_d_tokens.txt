God the Devil and < PROPMALE > . All I have to say is great . It was awesome . 
This despondency just seems to drag on , all emotion I once had is once again gone . Just as I reach the top of a mountain or hill , another appears on top and crushes what's left of my will . I just don't ever seem to win , Is being born such a sin that I must be punished over and over again , even more so than other men ? First my family , then my life , now my love-didnt let me type it all-what i do in my free time

drawing pictures lately . thats odd 
yay reality check 
i need my contacts back . my glasses are driving me insane !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 8-0 
ahhhh rain .... it's so soothing ... 
I woke up one morning to find myself wrapped in the things I swore I'd never touch . \ 
And here I am again trying to save what's left of you and I , So why aren't you satisfied ? I've had this song stuck in my head all day . I love it . 
Get to move soon . 
man im almost 19 ... holy crap 
what better way to spend my birthday than going to a head banging concert ? I can't think of one lol . 
thanks people for wishing me a happy b-day . i feel absolutely no older . The concert was awesome although i was a little disappointed i couldn't hear the opening band's music :/ . Other than that packed all my stuff today and moving into the dorms tomorrow . College here i come . 
my dorm is so quiet and peaceful ... great for sleeping but i can't concentrate on reading when it's that quiet . otherwise it's pretty cozy . 
got my new laptop :) its pretty =) 
got my new phone . shiny :) . i don't have any of your people's < PROPFIRST > anymore . just text and let me know who it is . 
Now that it's over , I just wanna hold her\ 
I'd give up all the world \ 
to see\ 
That little piece of Heaven looking back at me\ 
\ 
Now that\ 
it's over , I just wanna hold her\ 
I've gotta live with the choices I \ 
made\ 
And I can't live with myself today\ 
powerful lyrics . they get me every time . wish i could write that well . 
saw some cool people at work tonight . it's awesome when ya get to see someone ya know 
I've had a rather poetic mind lately but no real time to write . Hopefully i get some this weekend because ideas left unsaid are just as bad as a bad idea . 
Fridays and Mondays are going to long . However , tuesdays and thursdays are amazingly easy . I guess it equals out lol 
Just cuz i wanna know , what is everyone's favorite song ? 
Did i fool myself ? Does my mind disagree with my thoughts ? Am I like so many others who pick random books from the shelf , but never take the time to read and enjoy them ? Have i been what I've disagreed with all along ? 
homework ............... dang you Spanish ..... no quiro hacerlo . 
Sat in math today . waiting 2 get called up 2 the board 2 show my work . of course i get called 4 a problem i didn't do nor did i look at . Before I went to the board I asked < PROPMALE > what he got . he didn't have it either . He told me 2 guess invalid row 3 . I wrote it on the board . The teacher said it was wrong . the students disagreed . I worked it out . proved the teacher wrong . < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > . random guesses are amazing . 
woke up and went to work . not much of a day lol 
i have an indoor pool at my college and get to swim for free . amazing . thats all that needs to be said . 
school , work , school , work , school , homework , school , work , school , work , work , homework , church , homework , rest . when's < PROPFIRST > time lol ? 
just because i don't say it , doesn't mean i don't think it 
if it seems like i hate you , i don't . I just don't like the games you play . 
* bang ! * * bang ! * * bang ! * . that would be the sound of my head against my wall . 
Whatever I was going to say , I forgot how to say . Either that or i forgot it completely . 
its awesome when you actually hear your music instead of just listening to it . 
woke up late and missed my first class and was late for my second . however , since today seems to be my lucky day , we had a guest speaker and nothing important in the first class , i caught all the important info in the second class , and my teacher was sick so i didnt have my third class . i love it when stuff works out anyway . 
i could watch the same sad scene about 20 times and still not learn from it . 
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ..... that would be my mind today . my body is up and going unfortunately lol . 
sigh . getting tired of looking fancy smancy for all these dinners . Why must i get to know so many people whose names i know i wont remember lol . 
The song stuck in my head today - Your clothes never wear as well the next day , And\ 
your hair never falls in quite the same way- But you never seem to run out\ 
of things to say !... 
I'm\ 
sorry , at what point did i become the douche bag for asking people to \ 
be quiet at 3 in the morning when I have church the next day ? This is \ 
just a personal feeling , but all of those dumb drunk football players on\ 
my floor can screw off . 
song of the day that's stuck in my head-\ 
I hate you when you're gone\ 
I hate you turn me on\ 
I hate the way I need you when\ 
I don't know where you are\ 
I love it even more\ 
When I find you on the floor\ 
I know you think you hate me\ 
But I will always hate you more 
song stuck in my head today-\ 
Look at me\ 
Driving and I won't stop\ 
And it feels so good to be\ 
Alive and on top\ 
My reach is global\ 
My tower secure\ 
My cause is noble\ 
My power is pure\ 
I can hand out a million vaccinations\ 
Or let'em all die in exasperation\ 
Have'em all healed of their lacerations\ 
Have'em all killed by assassination\ 
I can make anybody go to prison\ 
Just because I don't like'em 
I don't know what the heck the word sleep means lol . 
song of the day-\ 
You are not alone tonight\ 
Imagine me there by your side\ 
It's so hard to be here so far away from you\ 
I'm counting the days till\ 
I'm finally done\ 
I'm counting them down , yeah , one by one\ 
It feels like forever till I return to you\ 
But it helps me on those lonely nights\ 
It's that one thing that keeps me alive\ 
Knowing that you wait for me\ 
Ever so patiently 
Everything is gonna be alright . Be strong believe . Yellowcard 
Just tell me how I got this far \ 
Tell me why you're here and who you are\ 
' Cause every time I look you're never there \ 
And every time I sleep you're always there\ 
- yellowcard or < PROPFEMALE > branch-\ 
pick whoever . \ 
sounds good either way . 
How would you describe your inner world ? I have a few ideas ... 
Really ... pounding on my door til 5:30 in the morning ? Now I'm just wondering whether you were dropped on your head when you were young or you were born with some sort of mental disorder . 
Cuz if you jump , I will jump too . 
Thursday needs to get here already . I want my fall break already . 
I don't belong here , I gotta move on dear escape from this afterlife\ 
’Cause this time I'm right to move on and on , far away from here\ 
Got nothing against you and surely I'll miss you\ 
This place full of peace and light , and I’d hope you might\ 
take me back inside when the time is right\

< PROPFIRST > , what volume does your music have to be on for you to hear it . \ 
ummmmm .... the only volume level it has ... loud lol :) 
Hours slide and days go by\ 
Till you decide to come\ 
But in-between it always seems too long\ 
Suddenly\ 
But I have the skill , yeah\ 
I have the will , to breath you in while I can\ 
However long you stay is all that I am\ 
-- Sick Puppies\ 
Btw people give me some music to listen to . \ 
all the songs I've been looking up so far are blah . \ 
I mean 500 some songs is nice but i can always use more lol . 
Ahhh . I love you Pandora . You're giving music I should already have downloaded and I love it . 
Friend : < PROPFIRST > , you listen to music too much . \ 
Me : Sorry , I couldn't hear you . What did you say ? \ 
Friend : Exactly . \ 
Me Inner dialogue : * i heard you . It would just take too long to explain to you why your wrong * lol 
And then she took my soul , but I didn't know\ 
That gypsy woman's got me under control . \ 
She fed me lies while she cast her spells . \ 
That gypsy woman's really ringing my bells . \ 
And to Hell , I will go , \ 
Knocking right on Satan's door . \ 
Heavens no , this ain't it . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > , I won't beg , I'll just take it quick . \ 
She took me to my knees , \ 
and now she's got me praying . \ 
-- Anarbor 
hmmm .... successfully downloaded 79 new sounds i got from one day of listening . Definitely going to need a bigger ipod lol . 
Cause I've been \ 
looking up looking down looking side to side\ 
Wonderin why this world is the way it is and why my mama cries\ 
Every night I'm trying to rest my head on the floor , half stoned thinking damn this shit gets old\

All the birds in the trees\ 
They make me sing so happily\ 
So joyfully\ 
Oh playfully watching me\ 
-- Scooter\ 
watch a catchy song to have stuck in my head . 
changed my mind on my status . I have officially decided i want to learn to do the little kicking thing on the jumping all over the world music video from scooter . 
I've got some scattered pictures lying on my bedroom floor . \ 
Reminds me of the times we shared . \ 
Makes me wish that u were here . \ 
Now it seems I've forgotten my purpose in this life . \ 
All the songs have been erased . \ 
Guess I've learned from my mistakes . \ 
Open the past & present . \ 
Now & we are there . \ 
Story 2 tell & I am listening . \ 
And the future 2 . \ 
It's all I've got & I'm giving it 2 u . \ 
-- Green Day 
why do i have such an issue falling asleep when I rather enjoy sleeping ? 
sigh ... unfortunate that facebook isn't able to recognize all the smaller bands .... 
note to self : if you are playing rock band at < PROPFIRST > and kiles house and aren't paying attention to your surroundings , you will be violated lol . 
congratulations < PROPFIRST > , you have officially been raped by the college financial aid office . Have a nice day at work now :) ... 
And this is how it feels when I ignore the words you spoke to me\ 
And this is where I lose myself when I keep running away from you\ 
And this is who I am when , when I don't know myself anymore\ 
And this is what I choose when it's all left up to me\ 
-- Red : Breathe into me 
Standin ' alone in soot and stone , \ 
He draws from this holster , a man . \ 
Crawlin ' alone through the soot and stone , \ 
He makes his way home half to death . \ 
In time . In vain . \ 
I wash my hands of yesterday . \ 
If I should fall , \ 
If I should pass , \ 
It's worth one last stand before the gates of hell ! \

Whatever version of the mortician's daughter I had downloaded I have completely forgotten about . The one on my CD sounds so much better than whatever I had before . :) 
to anyone who wanted me to come over on thanksgiving : i will be at work . \ 
to anyone who wanted me to come over the Friday after thanksgiving : i will be at work . \ 
in fact , to anyone who wanted to do anything at all within the next month or two : i will be at work . \ 
awesome . 
started tallying the times i want to say something but don't and the times i want to say something and do . it's 5-1 . at least i said one i guess . 
John : < PROPFIRST > , shut up . you don't even know what a girl is ! \ 
Me : Yea huh ! I've read about them in books ! lol 
< PROPFIRST>'s alarm for lunch was < PROPFIRST > bond music . I never thought eating could be so intense lol 
After a week and a half of running from office to office , filling out government documents , taking online surveys , waiting for people to be in their office , and a brief period of me saying screw my school , I have successfully registered for my classes for next semester . Luckily , they are all the ones i wanted . 
the more i think about it , the more i want to take up < PROPFIRST>'s offer of learning to snowboard . 
You say you know just who I am\ 
But you can't imagine\ 
What waits for you across the line\ 
You thought you had me\ 
But I'm still here standing\ 
And I'm tired of backing down\ 
And I'm here now feeling the pain\ 
Of a thousand hearts\ 
Been to hell and back again\ 
I won't take this\ 
-- 12 stones : Anthem for the Underdog 
two things . One : realized today that seeing myself in underarmor and my glasses confused me . Two : also realized that I'm hairier this no shave november than I was last year and its only been 9 days . 
sigh ... my roommate's never home . Kinda quiet here . all the time . just listening to my music through my awesome headphones . chilling on my futon . writing .... pretty sweet ... * someone or something should come to my room sometime and < PROPFEMALE > out * 
Cody : < PROPFIRST > , which is better ? A zombie game or an alien game ? \ 
Me : Ou ..... hmmmmm ..... Can't we just combine the two ? Holy crap its a zombie alien ! 
I'm bouncing off the walls again ( whoa oh)\ 
I'm looking like a fool again ( whoa oh)\ 
Waking up on the bathroom floor\ 
Pull myself back together just to fall once more\ 
And my heart's beating out of my chest\

girl : < PROPFIRST > , your gay . \ 
Me : No , I'm not . I'm just not attracted to you like that . \

Me : Alright . Fine . I'm gay . And while I'm letting secrets out of the closet , I'm also a women , in which case , I'm still not attracted to you that way . Got any other stupid excuses as to why I don't like you that way ? no ? okay :) 
You\ 
know there comes a point in your college class when you decide what is \ 
relevant and what isn't . The one I'm in right now is a prime example of \ 
one that's completely unnecessary . This is who this professor is ... This\ 
is where you can find a book ... This is how you get on our website ... \ 
How is that useful to my college education when I already know it ? Good \ 
bye attention in that class . 
Turn my head its back to bed with no delay , can't be bothered by the phone ten times a day , \ 
Why get up my morning doesn't even start till two ? \

Finally ran out of space on my ipod .... sigh ... 
You tell me that you need me\ 
Then you go and cut me down\ 
But wait\ 
You tell me that you're sorry\ 
Didn't think I'd turn around and say\ 
That it's too late to apologize , it's too late\ 
I said it's too late to apologize , it's too late\

... Maybe it is too late . But at least i did it ...

Sigh . Why must there be a lab tomorrow morning ? Totally ruins my whole \stay up and cram on the math and spanish homework you procrastinated\ " time . " 
just got on after lab to say I'm going back to sleep . Goodnight . 
Okay < PROPFIRST > , You Win ! I'll go on the freaking Guatemalan trip ! I'm broke as hell , but I'll go on it , only because you made such a convincing case over the course of the entire semester . By the way , Adios means go with god , so Adios everyone .

what if I'm not her type\ 
What if all the girls that ever like me\

Will I consider myself a failure\ 
will I give up\

I love it when I wake up and go to passport when there is no passport . Oh well . At least now I have more time to work on my math homework lol .

Singing out \the < PROPFEMALE>'s early light\ " \ 
Should be laying down sleeping or at the very least writing something amazing , but apparently I don't want to ?? Dang me and my terrible ability to fall asleep ! 
O ya know . Just gonna go spend another awesome Saturday at my favorite place ever ! Yay Wal-Mart ! It's also where I'll spend my awesome Thanksgiving from 6pm to 2am and MY FAVORITE BLACK FRIDAY from 1pm til 10pm . What a great that will be ! I love you Wal-Mart ! Thank you very much ! 
My crappy facial hair is actually starting to get to me . I actually know why I usually stick with a goatee now . it's okay though . No shave November is about done . I'm not gonna shave even a little bit . That would be cheating . 
When you have to choose between someone else's happiness and your own , Whose do you choose ? 
This is for my buddies in the service\ 
NO ONE GET'S LEFT BEHIND ANOTHER FALLEN SOUL\ 
NO ONE GETS LEFT BEHIND ANOTHER BROKEN HOME\ 
NO ONE GETS LEFT BEHIND WE STAND AND FIGHT TOGETHER\ 
NO ONE GETS LEFT BEHIND OR WE ALL DIE ALONE\ 
Have you no honor Have you no soul\ 
What is it they're dying for Do you really even know\ 
Have you no backbone Have you no spine\ 
Whatever happened to NO ONE GETS LEFT BEHIND 
You know you kicked your own ass in an ab workout when you try to get up afterwards and nearly fall over . Ah what a feeling . 
Sigh ... Thanksgiving just doesn't feel the same . 
few things :\ 
one : If you want to complain at me today , you will die on sight . I will not show mercy and couldn't care less . \ 
two : All you people who are going to shop at my store later better hope i get enough sleep to deal with your stupid questions . \ 
three : Thank you < PROPMALE > for sacrificing yourself so I could leave that GODFORSAKEN place . I owe you . 
Let's see . Paper for passport is due at 9:15 today . I'm just now starting . Should be done about 4:30 / 5:00 ish . This should be fun :) 
You know what's funny ? When you stay up til 5 doing a paper you think is due the next day when really the optional rough draft is due . I had to laugh at myself when I got to class . 
Last day of no shave November . Thank God . It really doesn't look that great lol . 
Well , I got bored and Light and Color today and decided to finally count all the words I knew my professor said way to many times . Here are the results . \ 
\In other words\ " in 4th place with 4 repeats . \ 
A thousand times before\ 
I've wondered if there's something more\ 
Something more ... \ 
I feel it's gonna rain like this for days\ 
So let it rain down and wash everything away\ 
I hope that tomorrow the sun will shine\ 
With every tomorrow comes another life\ 
I feel it's gonna rain\

I realize now that I am more innocent than people think I am . This can be rather difficult at times 
sigh ... Spanish interview ... I'm sure it won't be too bad , but still . I hate interviews . 
As soon as I woke up this morning I wanted to listen to some extremely loud screaming music and that hasn't gone away all day . I obviously want to go to a concert of some sort lol . 
Dear Kevin , \ 
You have successfully quenched my mind's thirst for music . That long awaited A Day to Remember CD was absolutely amazing and worth the wait . 
sigh ... Christmas approaches ... It's not that I don't want it . It's that I'm too broke to afford presents for the people I want to give to . College sucks . 
If u can wait ' til I get home\ 
Then I swear 2 u that we can make this last\ 
( La la la)\ 
Then I swear come tomorrow , this will all b in our past\ 
It might b 4 the best\ 
u know u can't give me what I need\ 
And even though u mean so much 2 me\ 
I can wait thru everything\ 
Is this really happening ? \ 
I swear I'll never b happy again\ 
And don't u dare say we can just b friends\

777 : You always seemed more grown-up than me every time I saw you , and I kind of looked up to you . I followed you around and loved playing those games we all made up . I haven't seen you for years . Your strive for God always had me confused , but now I understand . And I'm still your little cousin even if I'm bigger than you :) . 
I spose I'll participate in this number thingie . However , if you ask me to post what I think of you , be prepared for the truth . 
420 : lol first of all you would pick that number . You're pretty cool and even though I don't agree with everything you do , I do think everyone should express themselves in their own way . When I first met you , you scared the crap out of me , but as I grew up we gained a lot more in common . You listen to some pretty sweet music , give everyone a < PROPMALE > , and stand up for what you believe in . Pretty tough too . 
just discovered that the people on my floor pee on my door when they get drunk and I'm not home . I'm at about 3 different levels of anger right now , and pretty soon Mr. Nice < PROPFIRST > is going to be so nice anymore . 
I was sittin ' there thinkin ' ' bout her pretty face\ 
Kickin ' myself for not catchin ' her name\ 
I threw my hat and thought , \You fool 
well , I'm officially packing my crap and moving into < PROPFIRST > and Britiny's house . These people are all disrespectful morons , and I have no remorse I'm leaving them . I hope you all fail or dropout ... o wait , half of you already did :) lol . 
and I'm gone . Never have to go back . Already starting to feel better . 
I received an early Christmas present . A new journal to write in ! but I found my old one ... :/ . Should i write in the new one or finish the old one ? sigh ... 
Well could you Paint Me A Birmingham\ 
Make it look just the way I planned\ 
A little house on the edge of town\

Put her there in the front yard swing\

For awhile she’ll be , mine again\

Me : =) . You know , I told them the same thing . 
Okay ... so via magic I have the 24th , 25th , and 26th off of work .... How the heck did that happen ? Guess it gives me time to catch up on the 20 pages of writing I fell behind on , but I'm going to go crazy with that much free time lol .

We marched and we sang\ 
We all became friends\

Yeah that's what I'll be\ 
And when I come home\ 
They'll be damn proud of me\

my new years resolution has been to draw a smiley face on all fogged up window's I notice . so far ... great success :) 
I find myself listening to a day to remember more and more lately . I really can't get over the song \if it means a lot to you . \ " It's just awesome . " 
And if I ever hear that song again\ 
I just might kill someone . \ 
Not literally\ 
But the thought has crossed my mind . \ 
So don't don't don't\ 
Let it be love love love\ 
Because it hurts a lot , like it or not . \ 
If it comes down to love or money , \ 
It won't be love love love\ 
It won't be love love love . \ 
And I know I should know better . \ 
Man , I hate this stuff . Don't let it be love . \

Good job college , you've successfully made me want to read and write again ... just not what you want me to read and write lol . 
my homework , my fist , explosion . 
artist of the day for me is the Black Veil Brides . I need their music to make me stop feeling like crap . 
:) got my journal back . I can write all my stuff down now instead of saving it in my phone . Have to make it through work first though . 
regained the 10 pounds i lost over Christmas vacation and now weigh 198 again . I feel a little better . Funny it only took a little while . Btw dance central is freaking fun . I think i would play that for a few hours if i didn't have work today . 
School was easy today . played dance central for 2 hours and 45 minutes on hard when i got home . Cardio for the day was completed with great success . next on the agenda work : hurray money to pay off college . Then , homework . A very fulfilled day if i do say so myself .

Well there's and entire list of suggested work I should probably do for calculus if i want to do well on this quiz today apparently . The nice thing about suggested work is that you don't have to do it :) . Luckily i know how to pay attention in previous classes and remember things I've already learned . Get to the new stuff already . 
hurray ! finally got my background for this thing to kick in . took me long enough . 
You said it yourself . To convalesce from empty sorrow , someone had to squeal . To drive to the bottom . You said I know . I know it's not your fault . Like wire around your bones you would never numb . I take it I'm a mad man , but I would never squeal . I never said it was no good . \

hmmm ... < PROPFIRST > how do you feel about your paper ? \ 
Like it's a load of crap . Then again that's what i'm writing about so i guess it's perfect :) 
Everything seems annoying to me today . Facebook statuses , people , silence , this stupid award thing i have to go to . It slightly angers me . 
Are we just lost in time ? \ 
I wonder if your love's the same\

Sad when a psychology class can't get the mere organization of the nervous system right , and i have to explain it to them while reminding the professor what it is ... And yet , somehow , i have a slightly lower grade than someone in the class . hmm ....

few things about last night . The people who said avenged sevenfold sounds terrible in concert lied . They were awesome . To the guy who headbutted me , your fault you got a bloody nose . You shoulda known my head was hard . And to the guy who kept trying to mosh me , how'd the ground taste ? Overall , all the bands sounded awesome . wish i could have gotten a new medicine cd though . 
finished my book . My World : Hope , Despair , and Everything In-Between is as done as I want it to be . Don't want to drag it out anymore . 248 pages is enough .

less than 4 hours of sleep . let's do this \3 hours of sitting still in the same room listening to a boring professor talk\ " thing . I promise not to fall asleep professor ;) " 
My psychology professor just let us out of class early ????? and I have an A his class ???? I'm happy yet confused as to wth just happened . Not only did we get to leave early , but I have an A ? Not that I'm not smart enough to get an A , it's just that i really haven't been trying very hard in his class lol 
hmmmm .... i feel like i was going to do something ... but I forgot . This is gonna bug me . 
soooo ..... looks like haning with < PROPFIRST>'s not gonna happen .... again .... hey < PROPFIRST > , still have a seat open for zombies ? 
so in an effort to beat izzy hanstein in my top people , < PROPFIRST > decided to post a million things on my wall . Woooooooooooooooooow lol 
4 or less hours of sleep . check . move my mom's stuff today . check . go to work til 11 . check . hour drive up to dad's today . check . I can tell today's gonna be a long one .

I can't afford a Ferrari\ 
But that don't mean I can't get you there\ 
I guess he's an Xbox and I'm more Atari\ 
But the way you play your game ain't fair\

alright spanish document translation and speech , I have delayed you as much as i can this weekend . Time to start on you . Probly gonna be a late one . 
At 9 am , 1 vehicle heads south of sun city at a constant speed of 75 mph , forty minutes later , another vehicle leaves sun city , this time heading east at a constant speed of 65 mph . at 10:15 am , how quickly is the distance between the 2 vehicles changing ? Why did I type this ? I spent 2 hours just getting ( 65^2 + 75^2)/((375/4)^2+(2275/60)^2 ) = c prime/t via implicit differentiation & I don't even know if it's right . 
oh , hey bed , what's up ? sorry i missed you last night . I was with Calculus and psychology . Oh , you want to < PROPFEMALE > out for a few hours ? Yea , that's cool . We can do it now before i have work . Sweet :) 
Yesterday we were laughing\ 
Today I'm left here asking\ 
Where has all the time gone now\ 
I'm left alone somehow\ 
Growing up and getting older\ 
I don't want to believe it's over\ 
Don't say goodbye\ 
Cause I don't wanna hear those words tonight\ 
Cause maybe it's not the end for you and I\ 
And although we knew\ 
This time would come for me and you\ 
Don't say anything tonight\ 
If you're gonna say goodbye\ 
So today i went to C and C ( English ) and people were giving speeches . I had done mine last time so i was remotely uninterested in all of them except when a girl in a black gothic type skirt and killswitch engage t-shirt got up , played some killswitch engage and then gave a speech about how their songs were revolutionary to the genre of metalcore . Not gonna lie , it was pretty freaking sweet . 
You've crossed the finish line\ 
Won the race but lost your mind\ 
Was it worth it after all\ 
I need you here with me\ 
Cause love is all we need\ 
Just take a hold of the hand that breaks the fall\ 
Well I know what I've been told\ 
Gotta break free to break the mold\ 
But I can't do this all on my own\ 
No I can't do this all on my own\ 
I know that I'm no Superman\ 
I'm no Superman\ 
-- Lazlo Bane 
People make jokes\ 
cuz they dont understand me\ 
They just dont see my real side\ 
I act like **** dont phase me\ 
Inside it drives me crazy\ 
My insecurities could eat me alive\ 
But then i see my baby\ 
Suddenly Im not crazy\ 
It all makes sense when i look into her eyes\ 
Sometimes it feels like the worlds on my shoulders\ 
Everyones leaning on me\ 
cuz sometimes it feels like the worlds almost over\ 
But then she comes back 2 me\ 
Eminem 
i still love my profile picture . reminds me of an Italian gangster . 
i just became more interested in C and C 
played cod tonight . I was reminded of how little i like to play gun games due to their repetitive nature , but it was fun . And < PROPFIRST > ... you just keep sniffing those armpits < PROPMALE > lol 
He said : \You can't find that here . \ 
Decidí pensar alguno músico español en mí Pandora . Actualmente hay algunas canciones buenas . Ojala que me ayude aprender a palabras nuevas porque mi vocabulario hablando es poquito lol . 
The warmth I feel beside me is slowly fading\ 
Would she hear me if I called her name ? \ 
Would she hold me if she knew my shame ? \ 
There's always something different going wrong\ 
The path I walk is in the wrong direction\ 
There's always someone ******* hanging on\ 
Can anybody help me make things better ? \ 
Your tears don't fall , they crash around me\ 
Her conscious calls , the guilty to come home\ 
wooo for declaring majors and adding more classes to make college what it probably should be ... challenging . lol 
i think im done posting on people's statuses now . Now i can write my own . No this isn't it lol 
She walked away and I could hardly breathe\ 
I turned around and fell down to my knees\ 
Shivering as the truth is settling\ 
Her tomorrow has nothing to do with me\ 
I knew some day , \ 
that you'd find someone else's lips\ 
But before you go , \ 
could you just leave me one last kiss ? \ 
' Cause I gave you every waking moment\ 
I gave you everything you wanted\ 
And now , my love , you're giving me up . \ 
-- Madina Lake 
hurray my computer has crashed 4 times now 
my schedule is so fucked up that i want 2 take an entire room of desks & tables & what have u & throw them everywhere & watch them explode . Watch paper flying through the air . pens & pencils sticking into the ceiling & hitting people in the face . I can't have Calc II and Spanish at the same time . Guess I'm not gonna go on vacation & just take an entire semester of summer classes . AAAWWEEEESOME !!! 
Cause know one can understand\ 
I just cant be tied down\ 
Nothing comes between me and my plans\ 
So now I , never know , the things to say to you\ 
Now help me prove that I'm still on your side\ 
I never showed just what you do to me . \ 
The timing was always wrong\ 
I hate this town , it's so washed up\ 
And all my friends don't give a ****\ 
they'll tell me that it's just bad luck\ 
where will I find where I fit in\ 
sigh ... to anyone i told i was going on vacation this summer and wanted to come with : I can't . Sorry . I'm just going to have to knock out another semester of school with summer classes . Besides , it puts me a semester ahead of where I'm supposed to be . No one will plan anything for me on Tuesday , April 26 . I'm already buying a concert ticket , and I'm going no matter what . To everyone else , chúpelo :) 
had fun last night , but i forgot that i don't sleep well in new places . bed time :) 
Lets take on the world , but first , \ 
I got to make you mine , \ 
Dive off a < PROPMALE > , jump from a plane , \ 
Oh , it sounds easier than what I've got to say , \ 
Go for a swim , with sharks in the sea , \ 
oh , it sounds easier than me telling it to your face . \ 
I've got nothing to lose .. \ 
I've got nothing to lose but you , \ 
If I just say nothing , you'll never hear the truth , \ 
I cant keep using the same dumb excuse\

proofs by contradiction make you look like a genius :\ 
suppose x is irrational and y is rational . I must prove that x-y is a rational number . Since this answer of this expression must be rational , it can be represented as a number in a fraction via the definition of being rational , a/b where a & b are integers & b can't = 0 . 
Work and then study for psychology and write another draft . These coming weeks may or may not drag . 
Just think about , just think about everything , \ 
Be careful now , be careful what you say , \ 
While I'm away . \ 
This is the life we chose , \ 
This is the life I lead , \ 
They can never take this from me\ 
So here's to another banner year , \ 
We've crossed that thin line , \ 
Don't try to hold us here , \ 
If for just this once you'd think of us , \ 
I hope you're happy with yourself\ 
-- ADTR 
You'd be the drugs and I would be the dealer\ 
Everything you say is like music to my ears\ 
Don't mind us we're just spilling our guts\ 
If this is love I don't wanna be loved\ 
You pollute the room with a filthy tongue\ 
Watch me choke it down so I can throw it up . \ 
If this is love I don't wanna be hanging by the neck\ 
Before an audience of death\ 
-- Get Scared 
I feel like I'm losing my mind with no concept of time , \ 
I've got no space . \ 
And I wake up everyday in the same place , \ 
and it's you that keeps me sane , \ 
And this lesson I've learned , I've learned it the hard way . \ 
Just look into my eyes , they'll never lie . \ 
And I'm only halfway sober , \ 
And it's not getting me any closer . \ 
When words got me down , you keep me up . \ 
i can't live like this anymore . I hate guilt . Anyone want to get a place ? An apartment ? A spare bedroom ? Anything . I'll pay . I don't have much money , but i can pay . 
Couldn't sleep . Kinda sucks . Oh well . 
Welcome back my innocence\ 
How I have so longed to see your face again\ 
Overwhelmed I say goodbye\ 
As the pages turn I say goodbye\ 
Passing by the end of my life\ 
Pages turn , memories burning away\ 
Ashes celebrate\ 
You’re washing me , consuming me\ 
As I’m falling on Your sword\ 
You’re washing me , branding me with grace\ 
Innocence reborn\ 
-- Disciple\ 
I find it creative that this is a mix of the bible and song writing . 
Wal-Wart .... if i had the ability to say what i really , really , really wanted to right now , I would be fired , shipped to the middle east , and killed upon the arrival of the plane . But I need money for my ultimate goal ... and so one < PROPFEMALE > outweighs the other . 
I am tired , hence I'm going back to bed . I'm sorry friends who are morning workers ( < PROPFIRST > Book ) , but it shall be done . 
guess I should start on that paper . Should encompass much of my day . 
I'm sorry professor if the end of my paper drags a little , but I got really tired of typing what you wanted me to type and got real antsy about wanting to type what i wanted to . 
That Ive felt like coming home 4 the holidays\ 
Everybodys rushing about\ 
Why wont anybody hear me out\ 
My moneys low\ 
So instead I’ll write u a song everyone will know\ 
Can u hear me\ 
I write so much & it makes me sick\ 
About u\ 
Lets drop everything\ 
& not come back til next fall\ 
Everyone knows that uve got me\ 
Right where u want me 2 b\ 
No song really grabbed me to be put on here , and I'm too tired to write a real status . deal with it :) 
Stumped the Spanish professor with his own language . That's about 10 wins for me :) . 
I heard < PROPFIRST > yell across the room\ 
\Hey < PROPMALE > 
hmmm ... don't have work today . interesting . wonder what I'm going to do ... sleep sounds pretty good . Guess I could study for calc a little with < PROPFIRST > Kleinhesselink . Could just write since i didn't get to it last night . Dunno . Suggestions ? 
reviewing math with < PROPFIRST > Kleinhesselink . WWOOOOOOOO !!!!! :) 
Mend the broken homes\ 
Care for them they are our brothers\ 
Save the fading light in our souls\ 
In my opinion seeing is to know\ 
What you give\ 
Will always < PROPFEMALE > you\ 
And who's to say\ 
We won't survive it too\ 
On broken wings I'm falling\ 
And it won't be long\ 
The skin on me is burning\ 
By the fires of the sun\ 
On skinned knees\ 
I'm bleeding\ 
I've got to find that meaning\ 
I'll search for so long\

is thinking away . 
hmmm ... kinda stuck . Idk if my calculus solution is correct for my paper ... It seems logical , yet i have my feelings of doubt because the answer seems too readily available . well , guess I'll just have to turn on the music and work on it again . 
I find it funny when I refuse to answer questions in class . Then we get to sit in an awkward silence until the professor gives an answer . Does no one ever read their psychology book ? 
my status ... hmmm ... uped my workout from 3 days a week to 4 . 3 out of the 4 speakers in my car seem to have gone out , and it makes my sad . My tickets still have not arrived in the mail for my concert . And tomorrow is gonna be a nice day of relaxation . 
Feeling better . Spent the last two days at some buddies house . 
my lower abdomen hurts like hell and has done so for 2 days . I have to stop beating myself up with that kind of ab workout . 
I can't write beautifully , but I can try . 
probly going to end up calling ticket master tomorrow . 
Their cries are blown away with the wind\ 
How passive can we be before humanity is lost ? \ 
Turning our backs on those who need love\ 
We must not rest while healing is needed\ 
Tear down the veil\ 
That bars your heart from feeling this\ 
Dedicate yourself\ 
Give your souls to compassion\ 
With open arms embrace this heart\ 
With open eyes behold the truth\ 
Embrace this life\ 
-- Killswitch Engage 
well that was a hell of a lot easier . Why didn't they just tell me i could print my tickets lol . 
It's Monday morning\ 
And I would kill for a < PROPMALE > to drive\ 
Get so far away from here with you my dear\ 
That I'll never leave your side\ 
Nobody knows the troubles I've seen\ 
In a < PROPFIRST > , on a soapbox for the world to see\ 
< PROPMALE > away , and I wish this didn't mean so much to me\ 
To be a monument for the rest of them\ 
yea , i'm up at 3:17 am . why not ? 
Easter Break is pretty awesome . 
<3 (: 
200 words of this paper to go ... sigh procrastination , you are my evil little companion :) . 
cereal for breakfast , sure . cereal for lunch , heck yeah . cereal when I get off of work ? Why not lol 
Got to go to a concert tonight and < PROPFEMALE > out with 2 pretty sweet people . Wasnt as into the concert as i normally am but it was still awesome . The drive was lengthened by about 2 hours but even that was okay . The only part that kinda sucked is that Theory of a Deadman doesnt sound good live which i was prepared for so its okay . Also people I got my new phone . It's the same number so just text me . & now time for bed :) . 
I'm feeling mischievous for no reason . This can't be a good thing :) 
Question : Why is it necessary for me to do 2 psychology papers when in fact I have enough extra credit in the class from the professor to still pass with an A ? How about because it isn't necessary and I won't be wasting my time with that crap . I have much more fun things to do :) 
Ordered the tickets to lazerfest . Why must machines make things so difficult ? $57 bye bye , but another memorable experience is bound to come . Have to pick up my tickets at a yonkers or something i guess . You people better get your tickets , cuz I'm not afraid to go alone lol 
homework or zombies ? As if i didn't already have an answer lol 
Like my status and I'll tell you :\ 
1 . How we met . \ 
2 . My first impression of you . \ 
3 . What I like MOST about you . \ 
4 : favorite memory of you\ 
5 . But if you like this you must put it as your status 
You change your mind like a .. psycho bitch , \ 
but the sex is good so I think I'll keep ya around\ 
ahem , what ?! \ 
You're just too damn hot then you're cold\ 
You're yes then you're no\ 
You're in then you're out\ 
You're up then you're down\ 
You're wrong when it's right\ 
You're black and it's white\ 
We fight , we break up\ 
We kiss , we make up\ 
-- Woe , Is Me ( < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Cover ) 
I hate forgetting about something i wanted to write about . In all likelihood , it's an idea I'll never have again . Dang it ... 
I have 5 days off work ... Anyone want to do something ? 
What I've had to eat today : A pop-tart and a package of fruit snacks . Went on a run and worked out . Still not hungry . Just thirsty . Oh , and bored . 
Last day of real classes today :) . Finals starting tomorrow . Then there goes my freshman year . Hah , showed you freshman 15 . Went in weighing 198 and still weigh 198 . I win . Who says I need to be another statistic ? 
I have a place to live :) 
This has been on my mind since lifting . Today , someone asked me why I weight-lift if I'm not in a sport , to fight or something . I told them that it was to keep me in shape and grow stronger . They asked me why I needed to be stronger . I told them not to fight , but to protect the people I care about should the need arise . I hope that day never comes . 
no . I haven't ever ... <-- I've said that since going to college 
saw thor . not too shabby . ran into someone i knew too . 
You know I can never prove this solution ;\ 
You aren’t the one that I thought you were ;\ 
And so I learn to embrace this illusion , \ 
The line that separates- it starts to blur ;\ 
You tear me down and then you pick me up , \ 
You take it all and say it’s not enough , \ 
You try to tell me you can heal me , \ 
But I’m still bleeding and you’ll be\ 
The death of me ! \
