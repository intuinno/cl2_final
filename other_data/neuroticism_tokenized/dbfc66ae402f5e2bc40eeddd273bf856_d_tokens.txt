Also , when they brought him in he was on 100% oxygen and now he is at a normal percentage of around 23% for babies , that is great news ! PLease know that all of your prayers are very much appreciated ! I will keep you updated ... :) 
Puns called late last night on his way home ... they were able to remove one of the IV's , so , more good news ! :) I'm off to work ... :)

Leaving for UVA soon . A form of peace has settled over us , and I think < PROPFIRST > might leave us soon , but we only want God's will and what is best . All are in agreement . Thank you for your prayers . 
I am sorry everyone , did not get home till late last night , and was gone again today . Little < PROPFIRST > passed peacefully at 825pm last night . We know he rests peacefully in God's own hands . < PROPFEMALE > is doing well , is more concerned about everyone else . Memoria

Very awesome amazing Thanksgiving , and so much to be thankful for ! First Thanksgiving in our new house and to be surrounded by family , and friends who are still FAMILY , was sweeter than the meal , and THAT was awesome ! :) 
fear of heights coupled with uneven ground for the ladder = Christmas lights on the new house half done and NOT lit up . :(

I did the macarena with my mobile phone on a motorcycle ' cause that's how I roll ... LOL ! ( thanks cerrie ! ) 
PLaying Farmville with an eye that is light-sensitive from an eye infection of some sort gives new meaning to the phrase \I wear my sunglasses at night ... \"..."

Rode rides and bought some < PROPFEMALE > and Snoopy pencils for school . Got positively \ 
soaked on our second ride on Whitewater rapids ! Got back to the car to change MY \ 
clothes , and was worried about the boys ... ( finished in next post ) 
... but found 2 random pair of boys shorts I also bought at the yardsale and had \ 
forgotten about ! PERFECT . Grabbed nuggets and shakes at chik-fil-a , and drove \ 
home in the rain , but it was all good . Just thought everyone my like to hear \ 
about my day since it was cool . :) Off to bed ... * YAWN *

Took a nap , now I'm wide awake . Wish I could nail this sleep shit down . getting annoying .

I have the most amazing children . They are all intelligent , hard-working and kind . I am so very lucky . Somehow they inherited the best of us and not the worst . : ) 
Actually , actually got up early , ( after about 2 hours spent dreaming about me and < PROPMALE > Halpert ?? ) ! then wasted my extra time on FB . Hmmm ... can't decide if that's bad or not . 
Happy Friday everyone ! I'm off to work in the always crazy , never boring , sometimes frustrating freight business ... got pallets ?

Truthfully , there are days I ask God how I was lucky enough to be born in this land , and am I doing enough with what I've been given . Sadly , even the poor here , and I have been one of them , is richer than a great deal of people in other lands . Remaining thankful everyday should be our < PROPFEMALE > . 
Sang \Happy Birthday to Me\ " in the shower this morning and almost got a tear in my eye . How funny is that ? lol :) " 
Thanks everyone ! I'm feelin ' so MUCH LOVE this birthday !!! 45 ain't nothin ' but a number ... UP and OUT I say !! :) 
Fell asleep at 9pm (??!) and woke up at 12 to a big rainstorm . Dozed a bit then got up @ 2 and washed all the dishes finally . Eating a < PROPFEMALE > bar with a boring glass of icewater ( sound like an old lady already ) My life is weird right now . Going back to bed ... 
TEST COMMENT : If you can see this comment , help me out and let me know . I'm convinced that very few people see it . Either that , or I'm just not as popular and witty as I thought ... lol

Spent all my money . Stayed til the end ... you see what time it is .... Yeah . :D 
How can everything seem so pointless and yet full of purpose too ? 
< PROPMALE > discovered a < PROPFEMALE>'s nest under a forsythia bush he was trimming , and they surrounded him . He took off running fast , tore into the house like a bat outta hell , slammed the door and danced out of his clothes ... was stung about 6-8 times , and luckily isn't allergic ... didn't see any < PROPFEMALE > s for awhile , but gingerly picking up his clothes , they would come out one by one ... 
they were faster than any I'd experienced , one flew around like a house \ 
fly ! Anothr chased me and i ran , all around the kitchen and dining room , it \ 
was in my hair and when my arm brushed it , it stung my wrist , barely . These \ 
things weren't playin'! < PROPFEMALE > , was your worst nightmare . Might haveta add a \ 
chapter to the zombie book ... We've killed 8 so far , with 1 spotted and \ 
unaccounted for . 2 much excitement 4 me ! 
likes \If you like < PROPFEMALE > Beauchamp press like . \"" 
For our 29th anniversary , we bought a 1990 Honda Goldwing 1500 ... we couldn't be happier with it . Next year for our 30th ? Most likely a week long trip on it . California ? Maybe ... 
Yardwork , cycle ride then off to earn a quick hundred bucks ! Yep , Sunday's a busy one ! 
Cheap white zin equals dry white zin ... I like a little sweetness . ' Course I've been told I suck at picking wine ... ah well . Just a all food winds up in the same place , all wine will give you a buzz . lol 
CLEEEEEAAAAANNNNINNNNNGGGGG !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AHCHOO !!

Is it my life's curse to never be understood ?? 
cannot read long about the miners in chile being rescued bcuz i get tears in my eyes and have to stop . God bless all of them ... 
Getting everything ready to go help a friend with her daughter's wedding . I'm taking my ninja photos and < PROPMALE>'s running sound with his Bose . All is good ! Gonna be a beautiful day !!! :D 
Backed up < PROPFEMALE > on Mariner's Revenge as the Mother at Baja tonight ... yep . Just about a perfect day all the way ' round ... :) 
ROAD TRIP !!!!! With < PROPFEMALE > . Could it get any better ?? I think not . 
There's an alien and a ninja sword-fighting in my living room ... 
Box of tissues ? check . Soup ? check Orange juice ? check .... hot bath and warm bed ... soon to be checked .... well , at least its not a BAD cold , just an annoying , energy-sapping one ... ACHOO ! 
I'm sick . It sucks . :( That is all . 
To reveal oneself to the world is cathartic ... standing naked on the cliffside , nothing between you and God ... We are filled with fear to have others see us , yet longing to be free of all the baggage and coverings ... 
thinking of all my military fam and friends ... so few understand what it takes to do the job . Thanks Uncle DM , rest in peace , Thank u < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > M ., < PROPMALE > P ., < PROPFIRST > C .,... if ive forgotten anyone , im sorry . Thanks for everything you do !!!! 
Mom might come visit and see our house today . I hope she makes it . :) 
Isnt it funny how we make God our backup plan instead of the first place we go ? Leave God on the bench as 2nd string so we can go out and play quarterback ? Hows that working for you ? 
Don't get me wrong , I love tilt-out replacement windows ... super easy to clean except when you have 2 kitchen windows and only enough energy for one round of four sides , plus the filthy dirty bug-ridden sill ... ah well . One clean window is better than none ... 
Awww ! Sweet little < PROPFEMALE > , blonde hair flying , runs across the parking lot to give me a big hug . I didn't think you barely knew who I was , but you stole my heart today , little girl . Thanks ! :) 
Thanksgiving couldn't have been better ... this awesome house filled with people having a good time , and children playing . Food was great , if I must say so myse'f , and fun was had by all . Today was total contentment . To think of how blessed I am brings instant tears to my eyes . :) 
12:26 and all's well ! Goodnight ! :) 
I believe that you don't have to call God God for God to BE God . God is bigger than all that . 
Naw . Don't feel like posting my status today ... 
TRON was mind-blowing . Walking out of the theater was disorienting ... 
Seeing two movies @ zeus ... :D 
Sure on this shining night\ 
Of starmade shadows round , \ 
Kindness must watch for me\ 
This side the ground . \ 
The late year lies down the north . \ 
All is healed , all is health . \ 
High summer holds the earth . \ 
Hearts all whole . \ 
I weep for wonder\ 
wandering far alone\ 
Of shadows on the stars . 
Made the Woodbridge round-trip today to take < PROPFEMALE > to lunch and shopping . I wasn't in the best mood leaving . Hint : Theme song for the drive up was \Boulevard of Broken Dreams\ " by Green Day . ( Aren't I dramatic ? * barf *) But had a great time w/my 93 yr old bestie ... no one can hold a candle to her . :) Forgot ( again !! what !? ) just how good the whole \ " Broken Boy Soldiers\ " album by the Raconteurs is . Just love it all . " 
heading down to buffalo wild wings for karaoke .... someone come buy me some nachos , I'm broke . :D
