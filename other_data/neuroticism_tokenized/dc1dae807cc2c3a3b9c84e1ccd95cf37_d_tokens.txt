LETTING GO Part 1 To let go doesn’t mean to stop caring , it means I can’t do it for someone else To let go is not to cut myself off , it’s the realization that I can’t control another . To let go is not to enable , but to allow learning from natural consequences . To let go is to admit powerlessness which means the outcome is not in my hands . To let go is not to care for , but to care about . 
Part 2 To let go is not to fix , but to be supportive To let go is not to judge , but to allow another to be a human being . To let go is not to be in the middle arranging all the outcomes , but to allow others to effect their own outcomes . To let go is to to be protective , it is to permit another to face reality . To let go is not to deny but to accept . 
Part 3 To let go is ... not to nag , scold or argue , but to search out my own shortcomings and to correct them . is not to adjust everything to my desires , but to take each day as it comes , and to < PROPFEMALE > the moment . is not to criticize and regulate anyone , but to try to become whatever dream I can be . is not to regret the past , but to grow and live for the future . is to fear less and to love more . 
why is everything so small !!!! 
So let me get this straight - < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is getting his 8th divorce , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > is possibly getting married for a 9th time , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > and Tiger Woods are screwing EVERYTHING , yet the idea of same-sex marriage is what is going to destroy the institution of marriage ?? REALLY ?? *** Feel free to copy and paste if you agree ... I did

OMG -- Wet Basement 2 feet of water . Upside-we want to downsize . I've struggled with my hoarding impulses and trying to \let go\ " without much success . Very sad part-30 years of pictures destroyed which can't be replaced . All my files ( lots of paper)submerged . I just wrapped all the Christmas gifts this past weekend and they are floating away . I was so proud of my success in getting ahead of the mad holiday rush !! UGH ! "
