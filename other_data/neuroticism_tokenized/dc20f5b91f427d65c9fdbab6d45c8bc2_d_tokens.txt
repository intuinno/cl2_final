Put\ 
this on your status if you know or love someone who is gay . Our wish is\ 
that people will understand being gay is not a disease or a choice . \ 
People who are gay are not looking for a cure , they are looking for \ 
ACCEPTANCE and EQUAL RIGHTS . 93% wont copy and paste this .... Will you \ 
make it your status for at least one hour ? Promote Love & \ 
Acceptance ! NOT HATE . 
There is love in your body , but you can't get it out ; it gets stuck in your head , won't come out of your mouth . It sticks to your tongue and it shows on your face that the sweetest of words have the bitterest taste .

Watching a walkthrough of Amnesia : the Dark Descent . I will never sleep again . 
My math review packet this year is SEVEN WHOLE PAGES long . Suddenly , I feel better .

I finished my self portrait's face and now I'm staring at me creepily . 
Starting my Burnett Paper . 
the whole pressing ' enter ' to submit a post is really dumb . What do I do If I want a second line ? C'mon facebook , this isn't twitter : I'm allowed to have long , formatted posts . 
Okay , writing for the paper is done , but it's an absolute mess . Would anyone agree to proof ~ read it quickly for me ? It would be really helpful !
