LIFE'S GAME- A game tht we all try to win . A game tht has no exact rules . A game in which you get hurt & lose a turn or luck up & get something . A game in which some cheat , where as others play fairly . A game tht goes forever . A game tht players quit because they can never seem to win . I am a player who chooses never to give up & quit , even w/ all its twists & crazy objectives . The Game of Life is what it is . 
ugh today is whatever ... my last day to sleep in ... :( making cookies to cheer me up ... anyone want some ?

You can understand the facts of life . But facts of love are much different . To love you love someone or someone loves you .. But when you both love each other you're in love with one another . First become friends and let it go . Then get serious and get together . Just make yourself known as a person not as someone you don't want to be known as ...
