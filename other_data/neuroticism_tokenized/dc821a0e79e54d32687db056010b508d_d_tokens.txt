really liked Avatar !!! 

had a really fun day with his family . :) We saw Avatar , went ice skating , and had Bucca di Beppo for dinner . 
got his scientific calculator for Geometry !!! 
Would I be mocking Friar < PROPFIRST > if I called him < PROPFEMALE>'s holy accomplice ? 
is having a lot of trouble writing his closing paragraph . :( 
goes back to school tomorrow . 
My grades from today - Health Test A- Geometry Test - 90% English Test - 98% Dialectical Journal - 100% A Tree Grows in Brooklyn Groupwork - 85% 
Got a 100% on my English project today , and I did fine in my Health test , but that Geometry test was a stinker ! At the best I got an B . To be continued ....... 
I think I did well with that Health test . It was easy , but it seemed to me that there were some trick questions on there . I was one of the last people to turn my test in , because I took so long going over my answers . LOL . Geometry test on Monday ..... DUN ! DUN ! DUN ! Oh well , I'm looking forward to the retreat this weekend . 
The weekend is here ! Hallelujah !! 
Just tried out for the school play ...... I think I did okay ? 
hates < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > . Didn't make Mock Trial or the school play . 
thought the end of the Odyssey was lame . 
has had an easy week so far . Hooray ! He needed one . 
Had a very good day . He got a A on his health test , had fun in leadership , and enjoyed the < PROPMALE > Statesmen Club meeting . 
had a perfect score on his Geometry test until he saw that the proof was worth ten points . :( 
was laughing at the kids from coach < PROPFIRST>'s class trying to do yoga with us . LOL , priceless . 
hates the chapter in his new English book . Why must they use the < PROPMALE > names for the gods ? The Greek ones are so much better ! I get so confused whenever they mention the gods , I have to go back to the chart to see who they're talking about . 
was so tired today ! He had a hour and a half play rehearsal the night before , then woke up at 6:00 AM for leadership class , and than ran the mile in his best time yet .... 7.26 minutes . ( He has found Health class very revolting the last few days ) . 
was really bored at the < PROPMALE > Statemen's Club today , we really didn't do anything . He also wished that the Biology test was today , as he told so many people . Also , if you go to < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > , if you're on the third floor and go to the left hallway and look at the left wall , you'll see an orange poster for Tiger Fest . He made that poster ! 
is deathly sick . 
was vomitting mucus and blood at 3 o'clock in the morning . 
Needs the homework for Geometry , English , and Drama ( if there was any ) . 
has a < PROPMALE > migraine and the chills . 
I've realized that I've turned my Facebook status as a vent for all of my health related complaints . I apologize for this . 
is looking forward to the funky schedule at school tomorrow . 
said good morning to the sub in Drama today ......... Drama was my last class of the day . 
had sooo much fun in PE today ! We learned the dance to Thriller ! Ms. Z is so cool sometimes . 
always feels like an idiot in Geometry these days . I cut my triangle wrong , and that led me to write some weird unrelated proof . Luckily , < PROPFEMALE > T . helped me out . Thanks < PROPFEMALE > ! 
just finished his Odyssey essay ! He had so much trouble with the very last sentence of the last paragraph ! 
really needs to ace the Geometry test on Friday . 
feels like Mr. Mullen is biased . I thought that < PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE>'s presentation was just as good as ours , yet < PROPMALE > and I got a better score . 
has so much Geometry work to do . I have to read chapter 4 , Cornell-ify my notes , do the homework , and put the index cards on their backing . 
either did really well on the Geometry test or he got a C . 
is going to the < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > football game ! 
thought the bands sounded really good at the football game ! 
really needs to start working on the poster for Arsenic and Old Lace . 
is so happy ! I'm faster than < PROPFEMALE > Tang ! 
had such a good day !!! I ran two < PROPMALE > in PE , then we had a sub in Geometry , and I even get to sit behind < PROPFIRST > in Biology for another grading period ! 
is looking forward to having Wednesday off ! 
had fun correcting Prof . < PROPFIRST > in Health today ! 
can't believe how much trash < PROPFEMALE > and he picked up at Campus Cleanup . 
doesn't understand Mr. Mullen's homework !!! 
only answered two questions in Geometry today . We still got 100% though ! 
really wants his Odyssey essay back ! 
feels terrible . He only got 30\\40 on his Geometry test . 
YAY ! I got 95/100 on my Odyssey essay ! Then I went to see Arsenic and Old Lace , and it was so good ! 
is doing the brain for Mr. Mullen's extra credit assignment ..... 
got the H1N1 vaccine today ! 
went to Best Buy at 5:00 in the morning and bought a netbook ! 
has only finished half of Mr. Mullen's homework ...... 
is happy ! He had two subs today , has barely any homework , and he was the only person in his Health class to get 100% on both tests ! 
heard that the curve on the Bio test was 140 . That means he got 148\\140 . 
had another great day ! He got 100% on his Geometry quiz , watched a video in English today , ran a 7:40 mile , enjoyed the collaboration day , and walked home from school in half an hour ! 
can't decide if he loves or hates Fireflies by Owl City ....... 
hasn't even started his homework ...... 
doesn't want to study for his English and Geometry tests ! Ugh , the only thing I hate more than proofs is < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > . Although , I did feel pretty confident about my < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > monologue . 
probably failed his Geometry test , although I think I did pretty well on the English test . Apparently , I'm the smartest person Prof . < PROPFIRST > has ever met . LOL . 
is so exhausted from Scrooge . 
wonders why vomiting is a natural reaction to pain . It just makes you feel worse . :( 
thought that Sullivan's English final was actually pretty hard ! He guessed on at least ten questions , only because he forgot what a correlative conjunction was . 
had a very good day ! He got an 87% on his English final and 95% on his biology final , even the geometry final was easy ! And it's winter break ! 
just finished The Curious Case of < PROPMALE > Button . It was so good but so sad ! 
just looked at PETA's pictures of how Ringling's brothers trains their elephants . It's so horrible ! 
had his pupils dilated ! O_O 
is bored . Why can't we just skip the next two days and go straight to Christmas ? 
went to Bethlehem A.D. in Redwood City last night ! It was pretty cool , but the only thing I really enjoyed seeing was the baby cows ! 
has only finished the introductory paragraph on his English essay . I'm so bad !!!! 
says < PROPFEMALE > Christmas !!!!! 
is kind of bored ......... 
wants to go back to school ! 
just finished Transformers 2 .......... I guess it wasn't thaaaaaat bad . 
is looking at his English notebook , and apparently , the lowest score I've ever gotten in that class is an 83% on the < PROPMALE > & < PROPFEMALE > Act 3 test . 
is going to see Avatar tomorrow !!! 
still can't turn his essay into Turnitin ........ What is wrong with it ??? 
had his dream come true today ! He has an A in Biology !!! 
just turned in his essay . It was 1127 words long ........ my shortest essay by 95 words . :( 
is wondering if he's the only one who doesn't have his grades on Communicado yet . 
pretty much hates Communicado right now . 
finally found out his grades . He has a 3.7 GPA . His dreams of a 4.0 were dashed by his Geometry grade . :( 
finished Ender's Game last night ! It was so good !!! 
wrote one of the worst sonnets in the history of the world . 
is looking forward to writing three English essays in one month ! LOL . 
was very surprised that Ms. Sullivan liked his essay so much . :) 
can't decide if he's amused , bewildered , or just plain insulted by Mr. Blasingame's comments today . LOL . 
has a lot of homework this weekend . :( 
just got back from a presentation on the war in Afghanistan . It was very interesting . :) 
is in denial that he turns 15 in two days . 
is officially fifteen years old !!! :) 
isn't sure if he needs topic sentences in the Biography ...... 
does anyone know why Locke was actually exiled ??? 
didn't have fun with that geometry test . :( 
Does anyone know when the Demosthenes biography is due ? 
loves his amazingly wonderful friends !!! ( And his amazing new Snuggie !!!!!! ) :) 
had two subs today ! 
is confused . Did Mr. Blasingame say that he will be at school tomorrow , or that he won't be there ? 
really hopes that his English project comes out well . :) 
really liked the State of the Union address ! :) 
is relieved that he got an A- on his Locke biography . :) 
just got back from the < PROPFEMALE > Bride auditions . :) 
has over forty Facebook messages in his inbox that he doesn't want to read right now . :) 
[= ] \It's a smiley face ! With a unibrow ! \"." 
had so much fun in Biology today ! Sitting behind < PROPFIRST > again reminded me of old times . :) 
Just a heads up for everyone ! Our Freshmen hallway looks really bad . At least we had a lot of fun doing it . :) 
can't believe that he won't have to take the LIU test , the Geometry quiz , or go to Ms. Hensley's class tomorrow ! Hooray for helping out in the rally ! 
had a very interesting day . :) I skipped the first three periods of the day , then went to the rally , worked at the food fair , and went to < PROPFEMALE > Theobald's house to work on our board game . 
can't believe that he is about to go set up for Rant , but won't actually be going to it . :) 
hopes that everyone had fun at Rant , because he spent over seven hours setting it up . :) 
just had a thought . Will Ms. Sullivan use these two biographies to determine if she'll recommend us for AP Euro ? 
is about to go to a band event at < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > ! :) 
spent two hours working on his project with his partners in Ms. Sullivan's classroom . We were the only ones in there , and she kept warning us that the lights might turn off automatically ! :) 
didn't think that there was a movie on earth that could be as bad as the element one in Biology .......... the rainforest one today was WAY worse . 
can't believe that he made it to break . :) 
didn't think that Vancouver opening ceremony was anything near as good as the Beijing ceremony was . :( 
wishes everyone a Happy < PROPFIRST>'s Day !!! 
still feels distressingly ill . :( 
actually plans on starting his homework today ! :D 
Does anyone know why our grades aren't on Communicado yet ? I thought that the grading period ended on Friday ? 
\Like\ " this status if you hated the ending of \ " Of Mice and Men \"." 
had a so-so day in English today . His group got a 50/50 on their board game , but he made a complete fool of himself while analyzing \To A Mouse\ " . :P " 
had gotten two grades so far on Communicado ...... an A in both Hensley's and Sullivan's classes . Surprise , surprise . LOL . 
has officially concluded that pickleball is the worst game ever invented ! 
Is anyone else having trouble with Turn It In ? The Ender's Game essay isn't on the class < PROPFEMALE > ! 
isn't sure if he should keep this profile picture or go back to the old one ? 
can't motivate himself to go read < PROPMALE > Miserables , even though I've heard great things about it . Does anyone know if it is actually good ? 
Wow , we barely finished that groupwork for < PROPMALE > Miserables . :/ 
is so happy that his PE class got out of running the mile !!! 
Does anyone have an online Biology book that I can use ? 
thought that today's Geometry class was terrible , but was still the best time I've ever had in the class . :p 
got a 48/50 in his Ender's Game essay . What did you get ? 
has an overwhelmingly large amount of homework this weekend . :( 
Today , Geometry reached an all-time low . I did eight of the forty-five problems on the homework , yet I still got full credit on it . :P 
definitely failed his Geometry test today . :( 
You know how OCD I am ? I walked into Ms. Jenkins room to get information on the Europe trip for next spring break , and as soon as I started looking around the room , I began to pray that I never get her as a teacher just because her room was so messy ! 
is looking forward to tomorrow ! Rally , food fair , and no Blasingame , Hensley , or Mullen !!! :D 
just found out the weirdest thing ever on Google . So , even though Peschard is a French name , only 44% of the people in the world with that last name actually live in < PROPFEMALE > . :P 33% of Peschards live in Nicaragua , and 22% live in Mexico . 
How does Ms. Sullivan expect us to write a paper on the entire French Revolution that's only three < PROPFEMALE > s long ?! I have enough information here to easily write a ten < PROPFEMALE > paper . 
Is anybody else having trouble with the closing paragraph of the French Rev . paper ? 
Ugh , is Ms. Z really going to make us run the mile tomorrow ? That's just like extreme overkill ! Tomorrow is going to be a crazy day anyways ! 
I guess I should get used to it , but Ms. Biagini still caught me off guard when I walked into her office , and she immediately started a conversation about my older sister :P 
After today , I can finally appreciate my true love for Biology and my absolute hatred of Geometry . :) 
is looking forwards to seeing the < PROPFEMALE > Bride tomorrow ! 
is loving this weather !!! 
Wow , the < PROPFEMALE > Bride was pretty amazing . You should all go see it ! 
is definitely NOT looking forwards to the < PROPMALE > Miserable test tomorrow . 
You know , after failing the Biology quiz , doing terribly on the Geometry quiz , and having a hard time with the English test , you would think that I would have deemed today terrible ... but I actually had a lot of fun ! 
Ugh , darn you Mr. Blasingame !!! 
is incredibly grateful to the person who invented spring break ! 
Yes , I love you Summer , it's just that I've got a big crush on Spring Break right now . ;) 
had a great day at the beach yesterday with < PROPFEMALE > Replicon and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Simmons ! 
had a great day with < PROPFIRST > Rinck ! We went to see < PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland , wandered around the mall for a long time , tried < PROPFEMALE > from Ichiban Kan , had tacos at her house , and played around on her computer for a few hours . :D 
had a pretty amazing time yesterday at Vee's party ! :D 
Yes ! I'm pretty ecstatic that I just finished my < PROPMALE > Miserables essay ! 
Weirdest conversation ever : Were < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > from \Of Mice and Men\ " lovers ? LOL . That's what we discussed at lunch today . :P " 
is anxiously waiting for his grades to be posted on Communicado . :D 
is quite nervous about presenting in Mullen's tomorrow ... 
To all of the people who participated in the Day of Silence , great work ! You have a much stronger will power than I will ever have . :D 
Ugh . I'm starting with Sullivan , ending with Blasingame and Hensley , and then swimming in between . Tomorrow's going to be terrible ! 
It's official . Swimming was absolutely and completely dreadful . My worst fears have been confirmed . 
Warm chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream is amazing ! :] 
Hmmmmm , my handwriting was called \cute\ " today . I wonder what that means ... Hahaha . " 
Ugh , I can't believe Mullen's absolute stupidity ! Why would he take off a full letter grade just because I didn't talk much during the presentation ?! 
is thoroughly exhausted . We had to wake up at 5:30 this morning to do volunteer work for the free Disneyland ticket . I guess it will be worth it in the long run . :D 
My 20 year old brother just told a friend about how much he liked New < PROPFEMALE > . What is the world coming to ? 
Working on the English project with < PROPFEMALE > Theobald and < PROPFEMALE > Replicon was great ! Our < PROPMALE > Twist scene is AMAZING ! :D 
Hahaha , I didn't think it was possible , but in Biology , we found out that my arm is thinner than both < PROPFIRST > Rinck's and < PROPMALE > Bravo's! :D 
Tomorrows going to be amazing ! First , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFEMALE > are coming over to my house to make chocolate chip muffins for our English project , meaning that I get to miss that two and a half hour wait period in the gym . Then , I won't be have Blasingame , Sullivan , or swimming tomorrow ! :D 
can't wait to make some chocolate chip muffins ! :D 
Even though we've only had a week to do it , our English project is the BOMB ! :D 
Hahaha , you suddenly become everyone's best friends when you have chocolate chip muffins . :D 
Hahaha , I woke up at 7:00 o'clock this morning thinking it was Saturday . Whoops . :D 
had a great time being the only male at < PROPFEMALE > Replicon's birthday ! \I am beautiful ! \ " :D " 
Hmmm , two girls came into my Bio class today and took a photo of me for the school newspaper . They took it because I'm running for class president . So , if you see a picture of me in the school newspaper sometime soon , just don't look at it . Please . I looked really bad . 
is quite happy . He's one of only five boys to get into AP European history . :D 
So , Ms. Jacobs subbed my English class today ... I had no idea she was so odd ! ( By the way , I got 48/50 on my < PROPMALE > Mis essay , which I'm actually not too upset about ) :D 
felt quite awkward at the < PROPFEMALE > Heights flea market this morning . I was talking with < PROPFEMALE > Simmons about her biology project , when this girl who I've only met once came up and started hugging me . It was really awkward ! :P 
saw Iron Man 2 last night ! It was actually pretty good ! :D 
Oh my gosh , the food in my English class today was amazing ! Cookies with chocolate , blueberry scones , and a Trader < PROPFIRST > raspberry tart ! :D 
Contrary to what the < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Times said , I am NOT the sophomore class president ... yet . ;) 
A day without Mullen's crazy antics is a very good day , indeed . ;) 
had a very good day ! I had subs in English and biology , I took a nap in PE , and I had free periods in geometry and drama ! Then , since it was < PROPFEMALE>'s birthday , we had a birthday celebration in the cafeteria that involved a lot of cake eating . Plus , I'm going to see < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Simmons ' play tonight ! :D 
only has three small articles left to do for his Victorian Newspaper ! :D 
I think I now know why Ms. Sullivan likes second period better than fourth period . Loads of people from fourth period were telling me about how horrible the group-work was , and it wasn't bad at all ! We finished the work easily , with whole ten minutes to spare ! Second period is just smarter , I guess . ;) 
Dear freshman class of 2013 , I would greatly appreciate it if you voted for me tomorrow at the school elections . :) 
Hahaha , I love fifth period biology ! That arm wrestling match against < PROPFIRST > Rinck was epic ! :D 
\The < PROPFEMALE>'s Herald\ " has been officially completed ! :) " 
had a great time setting up the freshmen hallway with < PROPFIRST > Dotterweich , < PROPFEMALE > Feldman , < PROPFEMALE > Love , and < PROPFIRST > Prisajni ! 
had an awful day . :( 
To my freshman year teachers - \ 
\ 
Mullen , you haven't taught me a single thing all year , \ 
Sullivan , we're all convinced you use drugs and beer . \ 
Zeidler , your attitude is as crazy as your hair , \ 
Blasingame , you're just as fat as an obese bear . \ 
Hensley , your powerpoint we all dread , \ 
Schneider , why is your face always red ? 
Well , the elections were finally today . I'm not sure if I really have a < PROPMALE > of winning though . :/ 
Does anyone know where we pick up our yearbooks ? 
is so ready for summer vacation . :D 
Oh my gosh , the yearbook picture of Mr. Blasingame is creepy , disturbing , and hilarious all at the same time ! :D 
The calendar tells me that it's May , but the weather tells me that it's December . :/ 
is still in shock that he won the school election by one vote ! :) 
Hahaha ! I went into Mullen's room today after school , and after giving us a whole speech on the negative effects of overachieving , he told < PROPFEMALE > Tang and me that we were going to be working at a car-wash for the rest of our lives . :D 
I love you Summer , and I've missed you , A LOT ! ;) 
is watching Avatar and eating an It's It ! How could life get any better ? :] 
feels as if he has lived more in the first few days of summer than he did throughout his entire freshmen year . :) 
If you \like\ " this status I will post on your wall something I like about you ... Make this your status if you want a challenge ! :) " 
had a fun time with < PROPFEMALE > Kane , < PROPFEMALE > Feldman , and < PROPFEMALE > O'Neill exploring Pacifica and eating random food ! :D 
Whoa ! I can \like\ " people's comments now ! :D " 
Wow , Toy Story 3 was pretty amazing ! I also had a great time with < PROPFEMALE > Kane and < PROPFEMALE > Feldman hanging around the mall after the movie ! :) 
My accomplishments from this last week : I read 1984 and The Time Machine , I watched all three seasons of Avatar : The Last Airbender , I cleaned my room twice , and I've helped renovate my backyard with my mum and two brothers . * Sigh * My life is just the epitome of exciting , isn't it ? :/

is sitting down to finally read Candide . Ugh . :/ 
saw The Last Airbender last night , and was thoroughly disappointed ! How could such a great source material be turned into such an awful movie ? 
is leaving for camp today , and he won't be back until Saturday . So , until then my dear friends , au revoir ! :) 
is back from Fuge ! It was quite amazing ! :) 
really wants the Netherlands to win the World Cup !!! :D 
Ugh , Spain really shouldn't have won ! D: 
You know what was weird about camp ? There were people there that looked and acted exactly like people I know from school ! I can only remember three of them right now : there was a girl who looked just like < PROPFEMALE > Orozco , one exactly like < PROPFEMALE > Wong , and one almost identical to < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Espinosa ! :D 
Where's < PROPMALE > ? 
This is going to be my last status update for the month of July ! Bye facebook ! :) 
just got back from Arizona , and he saw the spam that < PROPFEMALE > Lexy O'Neill put on his wall . Hahaha , why am I not surprised ? :D 
is beyond happy ! I finally got my braces off ! :D 
is going to be camping with < PROPFEMALE > Modolo for the next four days ! So , once again , goodbye Facebook ! :D 
Oh my gosh , I hate you Fernandito Diaz !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Whoa , did anyone else get their SAS envelope from Ms. Sullivan today ? It had that letter that we had to write to ourselves the first day of school last year ! That was so cool ; I had completely forgotten about it ! Hahaha , sounds lame , but that kind of made my day . :) 
Hooray , I finally finished all of my summer work last night ! That means I have exactly .... two days left of vacation ! D: 
All in all , the summer of 2010 has been great ; it was at least a million times better than last year ! Sure , there was a lot of summer work , but I also had loads of vacation time , and I got to < PROPFEMALE > out with all my friends . * Sighs : * I hate to admit it , but I think I'm finally ready to start school . :) 
My schedule for this year - \ 
0 - Leadership with Ms. Colombo\ 
1 - PE with Ms. Noeth\ 
2 - Spanish with Mr. Lee\ 
3 - Enriched English with Mr. Hill\ 
4 - Chemistry with Mr. Ellison\ 
5 - AP Euro with Ms. Fornasier\ 
6 - Algebra II with Ms. Obedoza 
Like this status if you'll be at zero period tomorrow ! :D 
Oh my gosh , leadership was an absolute disaster this morning ! 78 people in one class ?! This is not going to end very well . D: 
Oh my gosh ! Blasingame's going to be in charge of a comedy/improv club ? This is potentially the worst idea in the history of mankind ! :D 
Honestly , today was a really horrible day for me . In hindsight , I totally just wish that I had stayed in bed all day . By the way , thank you so much < PROPFEMALE > Guerra for the drink ; I really appreciated that . 
Quote of the day : \ 
Ms. Fornasier - \So in these towns where people went on pilgrimages to 
Hahaha , the flash mob for \Dynamite\ " was absolutely AMAZING ! :D " 
had a great time at < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Simmons ' birthday party ! I wish that I had been able to talk with the other < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > kids a little bit more , but as < PROPFEMALE > Feldman and I discovered , we had been ostracized from their group . :D 
is really starting to freak out about the AP Euro quiz tomorrow ! D: 
Wow , I'm surprisingly in a really good mood ! In fact , I almost feel \Panglossian\ " right now ! ;) " 
is actually really excited about the Spirit Points for this year ! It's totally just like the House Cup in < PROPMALE > Potter ! I think the Sophomores should definitely be Ravenclaw ! :D 
Okay , so I'm seriously going to miss you < PROPFEMALE > Replicon . Have lots of fun in Tasmania ; make lots of friends and show them all just how cool Americans really are . We all love you , and we're going to be anxiously awaiting your return . :) 
can't tell if the new Apple social network is pure genius or just plain stupid . :D 
woke up this morning at 6:15 in the morning thinking that I had to go to school today . Why do these kind of things happen to me ? I wish I had just slept in until like ten or something . :/ 
Ughhhhhh , I can't believe Ms. Bokamper is going to make us start swimming on Monday ! D: We weren't supposed to start swimming for three freaking months !!! 
Reading < PROPMALE > and Hobbes can make a really bad day so much better . :) 
My gosh , this fire is crazy ! I mean , it's so close to home ; I actually know people who live in those neighborhoods ! D: 
Wow , I'm really surprised that my student ID picture came out so well ! I was honestly expecting it to be horrible . :) 
\We will never forget ... \"" 
Happy birthday < PROPFEMALE > Peschard ! :) 
There's no way that I'm going to go swimming tomorrow . You could tell me that I could save myself from death if I go in the pool , and I still wouldn't do it . You could tell me that I could save the world from destruction if I swam tomorrow , and I still wouldn't do it . Nothing is going to get me to change and swim tomorrow . >:) 
loves the Office . :) 
You know , I'm not usually ever very proud about my own accomplishments ; I mean , I always feel like I could have done better . So I was really surprised when I found myself feeling proud for getting a 46/50 on the first AP Euro test . :) 
So like ever since school started , I've been missing Mullen's bio class . But then I began to remember all of the LIU's , the Vocab Charts , and his crazy hand-written finals . Yup , now I'm pretty happy that I have Ellison . :) 
Wow , the Sojourn presentation today was pretty amazing . ( I loved how most of the kids who wanted to talk to Minnijean were from AP Euro ) . :) 
Great job < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > Tse , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Simmons , < PROPFIRST > Madrigal , and the rest of the Bye Bye < PROPFEMALE > cast ; the play was soooo amazing and hilarious ! :) 
Random freshman memory : When < PROPFIRST > -Lynn < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > , and I butchered the Poker Face skit in Drama , and < PROPFEMALE > got really freaked out because < PROPFIRST > had to pretend slit her throat . That project was such a train wreck . :D 
Oh my gosh , I literally can't wait for Glee tonight ! :D 
is listening to the Beatles . =) 
The Office starts tonight !!!! Yay !!!! :))))) 
has been awake for the last seventeen hours . O_o I'm soooo ready to snuggle up in bed right now . :) 
Anyone going to Fog Fest today ? :) 
had loads of fun today at Fog Fest ! =) 
( There was this plastic soda case container on < PROPMALE > Smith's desk that we kept throwing back and forth with the accompaniment of a holiday)\ 
\Happy New Years ! \ " - < PROPMALE > \ 
My life would be soooo much better if the weather was like this EVERY day !!!! =D 
Tomorrow's the last day of swimming ! Hallelujah ! =D 
( In Spanish , we were making our own sentences)\ 
\How do I say 
Dear Mr. Hill , I'd like to let you know that I really don't appreciate you forcing us to write an entire essay in one night . And oh yeah , you're definitely NOT the easier sophomore English teacher , so tell whoever keeps telling you that to go easy on the meds . \ 
Sincerely , < PROPFIRST > Peschard 
spoke with < PROPFEMALE > Replicon and < PROPFEMALE > Filar over the phone today ; I love those guys ! =) 
saw The Social Network with < PROPFEMALE > O'Neill and < PROPFEMALE > Feldman tonight ! I thought it was actually pretty amazing , but the other two weren't so impressed . =D 
should probably be studying for the HUGE AP Euro test tomorrow , but I don't know , procrastination is kind of fun , isn't it ? =D 
passed out homecoming ballots with < PROPFEMALE > Alcaraz today . So we had to go to Schneider's class , and unfortunately for us , we walked in as they were watching a movie ! Not only that , guess who had a prep period right then and was in that class at the same time ? You guessed it ! Mr. Hill !!! As soon as he saw me , he gave me this look like he wanted to kill me ... I like literally froze in fear . =D 
Lady GaGa , I must admit , you are quite amazing ! =) 
\Stand up ! Sit down ! Stand up ! Sit down ! \ " - Mr. Hill\ 
Rally , food fair , homecoming , and skipping the Algebra II quiz ; tomorrow's going to be an amazing day . =) 
\Oh my gosh 
Carrying the banner around the track was actually really fun ! =D 
So the dance was , uh ... very , very loud . And the dancing was quite atrocious . 
It's 10:10 on 10/10/10 !! =D 
No school today !!! Woot ! Woot ! =D 
Today was a really good day . =) 
I vote that we eradicate SSR and implement a school wide version of nap time . Only , it wouldn't only be fifteen minutes ; it'd be forty . =) 
I'm so non-violent , I couldn't even come up with a real threat against Mr. Hill ! I told him I would break his glasses ... even I admit that that's really lame . =D 
For a day spent taking the PSAT and working on my AP Euro group project , I had loads of fun ! =) 
is watching his first ever professional baseball game . I guess I'm kind of lame , aren't I ? =D 
saw Mullen walking down < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > blvd . wearing bright orange thigh high shorts , a big bum-like sweater , big headphones , and a HUGE backpack . What's this world coming to ? =D 
So basically , if you ever wanted to say anything to me , you should probably tell me it within the next 48 hours . Because Wednesday's five < PROPFEMALE > in-class essay for AP Euro will almost definitely kill me . x_x 
Like this status , and I'll tell you what Lord of the Flies character you remind me of ! ;) 
\ Mr. Ellison 
\Hey < PROPFEMALE > 
The dual of philosophers between < PROPFEMALE > Epling and < PROPFEMALE > Killjoy Pugh Newman today was quite epic ! I can only hope that there will be a round two some day ! =D 
Not really a huge baseball fan , but ... YAY GIANTS !!! =) 
Oh my gosh , this week is going to be amazing ! < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Fright Fest , < PROPMALE > Horror Glee Show , no AP Euro tests , and of course , HALLOWEEN ! I'm so stoked right now ! =) 
\The strongest vinegar you can buy is still only 95% water . I have some that's almost 100 times stronger than that \"- Mr. Ellison\ 
Singing in the shower = Best thing EVER . :) 
is going to be The Cat in the Hat for Halloween . Yup . Be jealous . =D 
The world is looking prettyyy fine right about now . =) 
9-0 . Sweet domination ! =) 
We may have lost the game , but 2-4 is wayyyy less embarrassing than 0-9 . =) 
When witches go riding , \ 
And black cats are seen , \ 
The < PROPFEMALE > laughs and whispers , \ 
' Tis night is Halloween ! \ 
In other words , have a Happy Halloween ! =) 
Am I too old to go trick or treating ? NO WAY ! I want my free < PROPFEMALE > ! =D 
Instead of learning about graphing quadratic equations in Algebra II like a good little boy , I used sixth period to debate whose PE class is stupider , second period Bokamper or fifth period Ms. Z . Turner , representing fifth period , won the argument by explaining that the combined IQ of the class was low enough to freeze water . What an effective use of time . =D 
YAY GIANTS !!!!! =) 
is skipping school to go to the parade tomorrow ! YEAHHH ! =) 
had an amazing day with < PROPFEMALE > O'Neill and < PROPFIRST > Dotterweich ! Although I still feel a little lightheaded from all the smoke that engulfed us ... if you know what I mean . =D 
After a long , exciting day , nothing beats sitting down in the sun eating a bowl of chocolate ice cream . =) 
The Special Olympics was incr < PROPMALE > ibly amazing ! Dancing with the special < PROPMALE > . kids was one of the best experiences I've had at < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > so far . :) 
Today was a beautiful day . And it was spent doing absolutely NOTHING . =) 
Good day . :) 
Whoa ! I totally just found myself texting people in Spanglish . I guess Mr. < PROPFIRST > isn't just some pointless form of life born to torture students . I guess I actually learned something from him ! =D 
So , our song for AP Euro is pretty much the bossiest thing in the entire history of the world . < PROPFEMALE > Killjoy Pugh Newman , < PROPFEMALE > Oh , and < PROPFEMALE > Kane are the best partners in the history of the world . =] 
Don'tcha just love how much stuff we get to blow up in Ellison's class ? That flame-thrower today was seriously AMAZING !!! =) 
WOW . Glee really knows how to twist a story , huh ? =D 
Like this status if you think < PROPMALE > Potter is better than Twilight . ;) 
I just finished my essay , and I have to say , it's pretty boss . Boom . ;) 
\This was a very long chapter ; you guys should have had trouble reading it . < PROPFIRST > ! What made this chapter long ? \ " - Mr. Hill\ 
\Jeremy 
Rowing to < PROPFEMALE > was beyond amazing . Seriously . Go see it right now . Well , not literally right now , but you know what I mean . ;) 
Wouldn't life be amazing if we all just drop out of school and go become Pokemon trainers ? I think that'd be just about the best job in the entire world . =D 
I'm about to leave for < PROPMALE > POTTER 7 !!!! I'm excited beyond belief !!!! =D 
< PROPMALE > Potter = The root of all awesomeness . =D 
Happy Thanksgiving , everyone ! This is such a lovely holiday . My house smells like heaven on earth . =) 
This is basically the funnest thing to do in the world . Sit in the back seat of the car , turn around and stare directly at the driver behind you . 99% of the time they'll change lanes within five seconds . I don't why , but it made me crack up every single time . =D 
I spent this morning watching one of those really old Pokemon movies . Seriously , Ash , < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPMALE > are UBER lame compared to Team Rocket . Those three are freaking hilarious ! =D 
So I'm working on my AP Euro study packet , and there's this guy on it named < PROPFIRST > Wellesley . I looked at it , but my mind didn't read < PROPFIRST > Wellesley , it read < PROPFIRST > Weasley . I'm really sick right now , and I started writing all of this stuff about < PROPFIRST > Weasley . I think I should probably go to bed now . =D 
I wish I could just go back to being five years old again . I wouldn't worry about solving quadratic equations , titrating chemical compounds , or filling out ten < PROPFEMALE > study packets . My biggest problems would be remembering to bring something for show-and-tell and trying to color in the lines . Wouldn't that be nice ? =) 
Okay , I've kind of become telepathic with my dog . So I came home , saw my dog , and got this weird feeling that she was ready for some food . So I went and got her dog food , ( throughout all of this , she hadn't even gotten off her bed ) , and when she saw the food , she went and ate it all . I felt like Dr. Doolittle or something ! =D 
So I found out today that Ms. Biagini's middle name starts with the letter A . That means her initials are R.A.B. ! This totally made my day !!! =D 
Today was a really amazing day . My team kicked butt in badminton , I went to Asian club at lunch , and oh yeah , Mr. Hill is going to let us finish our tests tomorrow . Boom . Hahaha . =) 
Celebrating Hanukkah with < PROPFIRST > Rinck and her family = Amazing fun ! :) 
So I just got back from a White Elephant party , and loads of people got really nice things , like < PROPFEMALE > Theobald got bongos , < PROPFEMALE > Shapiro got an airplane , and < PROPFEMALE > Guerra got a gift card . What did I get ? A < PROPMALE > doll . This stinks . =D 
This new facebook thing is confusing me ! I literally just spent like five minutes trying to find out a way to update my status . I'm just that cool . =D 
Dearest Ms. Obedoza , you are quite possibly the worst teacher I've ever met . I hope you spontaneously move to Hawaii over winter break and never come back . \ 
Sincerely , < PROPFIRST > Peschard . 
So I just spent the last three hours working on our hallway with < PROPFEMALE > Theobald , < PROPFEMALE > O'Neill , and < PROPFEMALE > Feldman , and it was so much fun ! Basically , I had a blast with < PROPFEMALE > while we trash-talked all of our teachers except for Sullivan and talked about everything under the sun . =) 
Today was a pretty nice day . I got 61 extra credit points in Algebra 2 , got 85% on the AQOTWF test , even though I barely even opened that book , and I got 86% on the chem test , which was just the < PROPFEMALE > on top of a lovely day . =) 
Since Mr. Hill has spent the entire year talking about how much we care about Ellison's class , I think it's really suiting that I'm hardly studying for the English final but studying like crazy for the Chem test . =D 
Only one more day until winter break ! =] But oh , what a day tomorrow shall be . D: 
OH MY GOSH ! I just realized that Christmas is next Saturday ! Ahhhh !! =D 
20,000 words . 35 pages . 117,907 characters . My study guide is officially complete . :) 
This morning was probably the most stressful morning ever , but walking into AP Euro made everything so much better . I love that class . =) 
The eclipse was amazing !!! =D 
Back home from the hospital . =) 
Had loads of fun with < PROPFEMALE > Steinberg and < PROPFEMALE > Stevens as we prank-called McDonalds , Supervideo , and pretty much every other store in < PROPFEMALE > Mar . Then < PROPFIRST > and I hacked < PROPFEMALE>'s facebook and wrote lots of ... interesting things to people . :D 
Reading a book can be really epic , as long as you have the right music to go along with it . =) 
Had loads of fun today with < PROPFEMALE > O'Neill , < PROPFEMALE > Lembcke , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Niekerken , and < PROPFEMALE > Oh . < PROPFEMALE > , one day you and I shall defeat the Tanks game on the Wii . And when that day comes , my life shall be complete . =D 
School tomorrow ? Blech ! 
So after school today , Kjersti Chippindale and I went to Hill's class , and we singlehandedly convinced him to give us more time to finish our tests on Monday . I feel so accomplished ! =D 
Somehow , I get the feeling that my family is really backwards . These days , I'm the one who has to convince my parents that doing homework is important , all while they're trying to convince me to stop it to watch TV . My parents are so weird . :D 
Gosh , where does the time go by ? I remember being a little kid not able to wait to turn double digits , and now look , I'm turning 16 tomorrow . But I'm really ready to be 16 ; fifteen was soooo last year . ;) 
In AP Euro today , we got to see < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE>'s , < PROPFEMALE > Dolloff's , and < PROPFEMALE > Lopez ' music video from last year . It was officially the bossiest thing I've ever seen . \Communists don't like donuts ! \ " \ 
Last night was incredibly amazing ! Thanks to all my friends who made it such a night to remember ; you guys rock ! =) 
Today was kinda the best day of my life . Haha . So I definitely aced the ( ridiculously easy ) CAHSEE with my essay about Fireman < PROPFIRST > ; I only had to go to one class the entire day , and I felt really great about Mock Trial today . ( And I finally got < PROPFEMALE > Theobald to help me put my tie on ! ) =) 
Good times tonight with < PROPFEMALE > Theobald , < PROPFEMALE > Cook , < PROPFEMALE > Alcaraz , Izzy Clayter , and others . I'm seriously pumped for this rally ! =) 
Surprisingly , I actually had a pretty epic time at Rant tonight . =D 
Just opened my e-mail to discover e-mails from 64 different colleges ( including Brown University ) saying that they were impressed with my PSAT scores , and they want me to look into going to their schools . That just made my day . =) 
No señor < PROPFIRST > for the rest of the week ? YES !!! I'm about to have a party just to celebrate this amazingness . =] 
Quote of the Day :\ 
\Yeah 
I love chocolate . A lot . (: 
I had an amazingly incredible last time last night at < PROPFEMALE > Pugh Newman's birthday party ! I never knew dancing and sliding down a skating bowl could be so much fun . (: 
In less than a week , I'll be at prom with < PROPFEMALE > Snitovsky ! I'm so excited ! (: 
Today was an amazing day ! < PROPFEMALE > Oh , < PROPFEMALE > Theobald , Kjersti Chippindale , < PROPFIRST > Stodder , < PROPMALE > Smith , < PROPFIRST > Dotterweich , and I basically spent the entire day eating a ton of Goodfellas pizza and \studying\ " AP Euro . (: " 
my sister is making us chocolate chip cookies . she is pretty much the bomb < PROPFEMALE > com
