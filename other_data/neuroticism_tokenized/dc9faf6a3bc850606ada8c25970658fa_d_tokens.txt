is , for one of the first times in his life , completely unable to be unhappy about anything . :-D ... except the imminent return of school .... >:-( 
thinks that's enough school for one year 
competition over social status and wealth and trying to put all on the same level . all of it is a waste of time and nothing more than trivial redundancy . we're all equal in the end 
feels like crap :(

this nation is sick . a disease has spread over it , and it needs to be healed . however , i'm not sure if the cure required will ever be seen . 
Guess wat everyone !!!! < PROPFEMALE > ( my sister ) has Swine ! 
my father has officially lost it .... the 2010 edition of Webster's Dictionary will feature a picture of him next to the word \paranoid\ " or \ " conspiracy theorist \"" 
so so much to think about , and i am currently unable to let two certain people know everything that's wrong with what they did and what they're saying and still maintain composure . i'll find a way soon .
