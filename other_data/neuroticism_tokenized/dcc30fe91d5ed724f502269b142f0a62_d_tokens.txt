Happy to be here and OK after crashing my ATV a few hours ago , I only have a few bruises and cuts 
I love sitting in my room listening to music , talking to friends , texting , and doing homework all at once , I think i have finally found my way of life 
Am suddenly realizing how nice my friends are .... it is rather creeping me out 
Life is Awesome 
I hate it when parents act like they know EXACTLY what goes on in school and how your teachers grade 
Homecoming day was AWESOME ! A very perfect day to the start of the perfect weekend 
Horoscopes are scary 
Best Homecoming game EVER !! We kick ass ! 49-7 
Is it possible to get homecoming tickets at the doors to get in ? Or do they not sell them after thursday 
Got my homecoming clothes 
Homecoming was amazing , I am fairly sure that I lost 10 pounds XD Thank you for the best night of my life ( < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPMALE > ) I love you guys ! 
Does anyone get freaked out on how accurate the horoscopes are ? or am I crazy . 
I think I caused some damage to my shins from last night . Oh well , it was worth it 
Finished the weeks homework for 3 out of my 6 classes in under 30 minutes 
A great class Just went bad , Guess I can only blame myself for it though , Lets hope it goes back to the way it was before long 
Really wants a hug 
What happened to the week ? Monday started off perfect and then it all went downhill , What do I need to change in order to get back on my feet ? 
Today started off good , and ended perfectly , Thank you MR . Geometry teacher , and people in that class ! 
just realized that his friends are the ones making him happy 
My parents are trying to force me to hand out < PROPFEMALE > even though I REALLY don't want too . I think they are more lazy than I since they are right by the door . 
Tomorrow and Tuesday people will be able to Write on my Shirt as a late Halloween Costume . Must use blue pen . 
I think I upset one of my friends but I am unsure how . 
Am planning to go to MegaMind this Saturday , Anyone want to go ? 
Finished the most most difficult homework yet .... Now I have nothing to do for the next 5 hours 
Truth is ... 
Is it bad if I said I would rather be at school than my house ? 
Geometry class made my day awesome ! 
My first play in high school is at 7:00 PM tonight , wish me luck 
Last night was awesome ! We got one more play to do before I need to say goodbye to drama class . 
Awesome day , So many things went perfect , How can this school year get any better ? 
Just noticed I was doing a Yes/No game thinking there was an end to it .... 40 minutes later I realized that there was no end 
Truth is ... ( For all the new people that are my friends )
