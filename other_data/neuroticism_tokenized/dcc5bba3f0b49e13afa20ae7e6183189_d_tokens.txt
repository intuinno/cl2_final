I Miss boyfriend ^_^ cant wait till Saturday 
Trying to pretend that everything is gonna be okay ... :'( 
Why do i try ? Because I can . Why don't I give up ? Because I dont have to . Why do I keep a smile on my face when i feel sad ? I really have no Idea .. :) But It helps sometimes ... 
I’m on the brink of disaster Starin’ down the consequences So brake hard we’ll be better Tonight I’ll do what it takes to fail 
Trying to figure it out You wanna reach out You wanna give in Your head's wrapped around what's around the next bend You wish you could find some < PROPFEMALE > ng warm ' Cause you're shivering cold It's the first < PROPFEMALE > ng you see as you open your eyes The last < PROPFEMALE > 
Another Day ... :'( 
Oh , we can't make up for the lost times that we both apologize for And I can't stand the fact that this extremity is the centre of my day You're the centre of my day Oh , Mondays I sleep away Tuesdays I lay awake Wednesdays are the worst Whoa , Thursdays I reminisce Friday , I see your face and I can't breathe Although the distance is daring , I sure know what it's like to be alone . 
Ipod ! n homework sort of ... eh heh okay you caught me , not really doing homework ... 
Okay okay Im thinking that im gonna skip the whole \Homework\ " thing .... again haha :P there are just to many non-homeworky things to do !! Like playing with sidewalk chalk ! bah hah there is no room for homework when youve got a bucket of chalk and an imagination !!! " 
Oh yeah thats right ! I got 13 bucks !! Woo ! :) Partayyy !! 
Eeeeeek ! :P I wonder who invented sticky notes ... were they just randomly like \Hey ! Lets make little paper squares that are sticky and then people can write on them to remember stuff ! \ " What the ???!!??!?! Like seriously how random is that ?? " 
Take me under Your wing tonight Make me so perfect in Your eyes Hold on cause it will be alright You're not alone Please help me get from worse to better Before these tears soak through this lonely sweater And let me know that I'm alright I still have one strike of this match left And I'm holding on to my last breath And its getting a little dark around to see here 
is Lonely ... :'( 
You pulled a part of me I could never understand Crashing to your side and your breaking up this silence Never to again let my courage fall . You try for every moment , walking hand in hand . So encouraging . I’m continually coming , time and time again for anything you say now . For anything you say now . 
I want a pack of psycho nocturnal rabid squirrels !!! ^-^ It just seems like they would be so fun play with ..... hahahahahahahah 
Tough Day ... 
Just got back from Hikin ... I had sooo much fun ! ( Wooo ) Ill post pictures later :P

Off to church ! Had a blast at the dance last night :D 
Everyone check out my chalk album its Hiliarium !!! ^-^ 
Bad Day .... but i finished a book and started a charcoal drawing .. that part wasnt so bad .... woo 
Bleh this ocean coldness thing is killin me ! 9 days till Utah !!! ^-^ 
Y-E-S ! Okay i have to brag because this absolutely NEVER happens to me but .... I Aced my Chem test !! And !!! (Prepare to be surprised ) MY TRIG TEST !! I know i know its close to impossible for me but , that just goes to show that you DONT have to study to be a complete genius !! ^-^ Like me !! :P 
Okay okay if you had to be stuck in a gumball machine for the rest of your life , then where would you want that gumball machine to be located ???????? ^-^ And what flavor gumball would you choose to be ??????? 
Serious Question of the day : How many of my buddees are genuinly excited about my visit to Utah in 4 DAYS !?! ^-^ 
Had zee most amazing weekend wif me bestest friend < PROPFEMALE > !! And especially wif < PROPFIRST > !! <3 
Ah hah haha .... MONKEYS hahahahahah :))))) 
I dropped my phone in a smoothie yesterday ... :/ Its all sticky 
Is ready for a drastic change :P 
We've got all night just to make it all right Would you take a walk with me ? I'll give you all I've got just spare me your time And I promise you won't want to leave Are you , are you falling for me ? This time , we'll find what we both need There's an old oak tree We can swing and sway We'll lock arms and legs When I look at you You're so far away Oh so far away Oh if you could you just let go ... 
Pain is only weakness leaving the body .. 
Write me down , I am the words : falling apart . Take this broken world off of my heart . So I stumble down into the room where the templates are made . And you show me that somehow I can change these days . You pulled a part of me I could never understand Crashing to your side and your breaking up this silence Never to again let my courage fall . 
Hmmm im thinking that i need some bubble gum .... :D 
I will solve your mystery and make it ancient history . Some guys try to hide the way they feel . And sometimes it takes someone to break the seal . U can't negotiate a one-way deal . Nothin from nothin gets U nothin at all . I'll wait I've got the < PROPFEMALE > of a saint . I just don't want U to hesitate . Cause you don't ever wanna mess with fate . Nothing from nothing gets you nothing at all . There's no rhyme and there's no reason 
I'm tongue tied and terrified of what i'll say but i never told you everything . i'm losing hope and fading dreams and every single memory along the way 
Throwing up is not the best experience in the world :/ ill just leave it at that ! 
Okay okay random question of the day : Why are boxing rings square shaped ?? 
Ready to party ! :P 
Hmmm contemplating how much money it would cost me to hire a hitman ! >.< Hahaha 
Ahhhh ! I love cheesy horror movies on Halloween >.< Hahaha Eeeek im sooo giggly Ah hahhah ahah :P It must be a sugar rush ??? :P 
Ready for sketching !! Haha < PROPFIRST > im sooo excited ! 
Im thinking of taking photos today :) 
Okay im avoiding the inevitable . I need to go do homework :/ Ugh i know i know it pains me too !! 
Sometimes I just really hate life .... :/ I need help cheering up . Seriously . 
Haha excited to see Pacific Lights on the 20th ! :P 
Feels like a bomb going off in my conscious . and I feel it again , I think it's coming again How can I run away from all of the sadness ? When no ones around to tell me where to begin . These steps I climb up so hard . Your voice will hit me so hard . Because of you . It's always because of you . I can't < PROPFEMALE > this all , I can't < PROPFEMALE > this on my own Tell me what did I do wrong ? ' Cause I don't remember anything 
Am I right where I need to be Or is this another distraction Is this how I'm supposed to feel I've been trying to let go Is there a change you need to see Or is this another disaster Tell me how I'm supposed to feel I've been trying to let go 
<3 ...... Butterflies 
Ugh that 3 hours of sleep last night has done me nooo good :/ 
Things are so messed up sometimes . Hm .

Utah in ONE WEEK !!! I Cant Wait ! ^-^ Ugh but being sick really sucks !! :/ 
And if you slow down could it ever be this fun ? in a small town with no where else to run give it time , figure it out get in line , and narrow it down youd go farther then you ever thought you could

Music <3 Music <3 Music can get you through anything ! 
Circle me and the needle moves gracefully Back and forth If my heart was a compass you'd be north Risk it all cause I'll catch you if you fall Wherever you go If my heart was a house you'd be home 
Live for today , we'll dream tomorrow We've got big plans in sight We'll take this city , and by nightfall the bright lights are calling Everything is going our way 
The truth is , if all my friends did jump off of a bridge chances are I would too :P Hahaha Im dumb like that 
Last year seems so distant . Yet so .... not .

Wondering why im wasting my time . 
Well if throwing up in < PROPMALE > Taco wasnt just great then ill definately have to go with accidently slapping < PROPFIRST > in the face , or playing the random game , or throwing ice game , or the lion/lion tamer game , or bloody knuckles , or random voice cracks , or maybe snowball fights . hmm .. ridiculous . 
When life sucks all you can do is laugh it off and hope it gets better , eventually it will . 
Ooh on the brighter side , i finished a song today :) I cant wait to go over it with Kimball and write zee music ^-^

The moment has come to face the truth\

The surface is gone , we scratched it off\ 
We made some plans , and let them go\ 
Do you have the slightest idea\ 
Why the world is bright with you here ? \ 
Stay a while and wait and see\ 
If things go right we're meant to be
