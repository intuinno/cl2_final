Repost if you have someone in The Spirit World ... I thought of you today , but that is nothing new . I thought about you yesterday , and days before that too . I think of you in silence , I often speak your name . All I have are memories and a picture in a frame . Your memory is a keepsake , from which I'll never part . The Creator has you in his arms , I have you in my heart . ? ? ? 
A wise man once said , believe half of what you see , none of what you hear ! But around this town , people believe everything they hear and make up what they see ! 
STOP spending so much time being unhappy about your life and START realizing it could be gone in the blink of an eye . LIVE it to the fullest each day . 
wishes more people would open their minds and shut their mouths than the other way around 
RANDOM FACTS : It takes 7 seconds for food to pass from mouth to stomach . A human hair can hold 3 kg . The length of the penis is three times the length of the thumb . The femur is as hard as concrete . A woman's heart beats faster than a man's . Women blink twice as much as men . We use 300 muscles just to keep our balance when we stand . The woman has read this entire text . The man is still looking at his thumb ... 
mom always said if you cant say anything nice don't say anything at all . And people wonder why I am so quiet ! 
Have you ever had the type of day where no one has done anything wrong to you , yet you want to punch them in the face anyway ? Yeah , I'm there . 
I am the way I am , I will never change , you'll love me or hate me , but I will always be me . 
has realized that life is full of unexpected twists and turns but if you can just hold on to faith that everything will turn out fine and it will .

God put Mt Everest in front of me . Some look at it as impossible . I look at it as a challenge . God won't put any mountain in front of me that I can't climb . 
The best thing in life is that God sees all your mistakes and weaknesses , knows your imperfections and still thinks you're completely amazing !
