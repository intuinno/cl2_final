XD Steeler's win in OT against the Titans . < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > kicked a 33yd fg =D 13-10 Steelers BABEHHHHH <33333333 
It's amazing how this world kept going as if nothing had happened eight years ago today . I couldn't keep my mind off of it . R.I.P. < PROPMALE > Pouillon , a man who this morning died for a cause . Holding an anti-abortion sign in his front yard , he was gunned down . Prayers are with his family . 
Still has yesterdays murder on my mind -.- that's just too sad . 
>.> I'm listening to High School Musical songs ... what's wrong with me today ? 
Mhm that's a tastey lick <3 
Mhm that's a tastey lick <3 Let us never speak of this again >.> 
Life be's the complicateds . 
Life is complicated , you never know what's coming . But hey , cheer up , it gets worse ! 
I got into my first car wreck ... insane . 
I think life is too complicated as an adult . On the other hand , I'm considering changing my < PROPMALE > in college =D 
United States of < PROPFEMALE > , looks like another silent night . As we're < PROPFIRST > to sleep by philosophies that save the trees and kill the children . And while we're lyin ' in the dark , there's a shout across the Eastern sky . < PROPFEMALE > , what we will miss while we're sleeping . Will Jesus come again , and leave us slumbering where we lay ? 
I think ... Always by Saliva is amazing =D 
505 people are unsure if < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE>'s statement that all anti-Obama protestors are racist . When something like that becomes a hard concept , we need to educate more people . 
It's kind of scary that MySpace and Twitter can now be updated together at once ... stupid betas that come up with . This is going to be horrible , can you imagine this ? MySpace flooding with statuses . Quick , everyone delete bands ^.^ 
I have new pictures up =] Tomorrow is going to be my favorite dress up day , just sayin . About to read < PROPFEMALE > Letter for Turtle Man's class ... then creative writing <3 Peace <3 
So hopefully going to homecoming soonishhh <3 and the game where the Wright City Wildcats are going to stomp the other team . Lovin ' it <3 
Woot =D I have my first job , I can't wait til Saturday . Haha . Also finding it interesting that nobody knows how Hitler died now , turns out the skull claimed to be his was a woman who died before she turned 40 . 
I think it's unbelievable that so many women have abortions without thinking about what they give up , while so many women sit crying because they can't have their own family . This world is one messed up place . 
I feel like chillin ' this wholeee weekend . Last week seemed really long . I was sick of school the last two days . I need re-lax-ation . 
Ight , I'm out . This night has been long . Hopefully sleepin long tomorrow , but with my dog , it's usually very iffy . He loves to jump on me at 7am . I might just throw him and out and go back to sleep haha . Goodnight all =D 
Is 50 dollars a lot for a concert ticket ? It's the < PROPFIRST > Clarkson concert . Seems expensive >.> but may be worth it . I love that woman ^.^ 
O.o I want to see ' Paranormal Activity ' so bad ... like REALLY bad D= It needs to be available in our areaaa 
Starts work tomorrow at 4pm =D I'm uber excited . Woot ! Also , anyone from Brophy's class catch what we read to ? I think I spaced off last class XD

Off to work ... hope it goes by fast tonight . Peace 
Gah . My feet hurt , work was kinda slow tonight but oh well . One of those nights . 
I don't think my hair is going to get done today . Hopefully soon though , it's getting too long . I have to go to work at 4 . Hopefully it's not super busy =] 
I don't understand life anymore . So many things that need to be changed . Why does the world insist on losing their minds and supporting pointless things . Thanks for your healthcare plan , Obama . Now look at your kids and tell them you're letting the government pay for killing them . 
Wonder's if she's get in trouble for wearing < PROPFEMALE > canes on her face for work ? 
Is listening to < PROPFIRST > Lambert's cd . Ahhhh I love him <3<3

Life can't go on as I know it ... < PROPFIRST > Sullivan is dead . How does one overcome this ? I love < PROPFIRST > , forever . My love , The Rev . RIP man , you'll be missed . 28 years of life wasn't long enough for you . Forever , The Rev <3 
Getting my tattoo is going to have to wait . Turns out my paycheck was crappy from a few days I couldn't work from holidays ... but soon . Guaranteed .... soon .

RIP Kimmy , forever in our hearts . 
Prom rocked <3 but I'm tired as can be . Goodnight . 
Last night was funnnnn but now I'm tired haha . 
I rewrote my about me section along with interests and things . I feel more accomplished . 
I wonder how many people who are getting high today realized it's Hitler's birthday ? 4/20 is stupid . 
Yay it just thundered =D maybeeee we'll get another tornado ? I hope so =D 
I'm already tired of being sick . lol 
It's not everyday , or ever family for that matter , that you can listen to your mom yell at squirrels on her deck for eating off her bird feeders while she loads the bb gun . 
I'm just uber annoyed by life today . 
The game . 
Sometimes she can't help but wonder what she's going to do . 
Thunderstorms ! Tornadoes ! Hail ! W00T !!! It's bowing out too ;) It's gonna be one helluva good night . 
=/ 
Life's journey is not to arrive at the grave safely in a well preserved body , but rather skid in sideways , totally worn out , shouting , \Holy Sh#% .... What a ride ! \"" 
In life , the answers are not in the back of the book . - < PROPFIRST > Brown . 
The bad news is , time flies . The good news is , you're the pilot . 
I pretend to be normal , but it gets boring . So I go back to being me . 
My wife , < PROPFEMALE > , is cheating on me . I feel betrayed . =P 
Nothing is more painful than thinking someone will be there for the rest of your life and finally realizing in your mind that they've been gone for a long time . 
I got my job =] Woot =D 
-Sigh- Almost time for summer . Hopefully work will keep my mind occupied from everything . 
Anyone the schedule for tomorrows final reviews ? 
I wish life solved it's own problems and we could just sit back and let it all happen . 
The last day of school today , yet it still feels like I have to show up tomorrow . Especially since they made it Monday >.< 
Work earllyyyyy in the morning . First day not too bad . My arms hurt though haha . 
My new schedule isn't THAT bad . However I have Kester everyday ... Senior year = fail ? lol

Going to see Beauty and the Beast in St. < PROPFIRST > soon . Rather fun . 
I feel extremely unproductive this summer . I set a million goals but everyday it's SO hot out that I don't want to go outside . This is so ridiculous . I need to do something . 
Now I miss < PROPFIRST > =( new drummer is NOT the same . He sounds like he's pounding the drums and not playing them . It almost overpowers Syn . Tisk tisk . 
I feel productive today ... I've donated like 9000 grains of rice total for the day . And in the process I've learned of countries I didn't know existed , mistook Africa for Alaska , learned Italian , < PROPMALE > , and some Spanish . Life is pretty awesome . 
Best words ever : Macaroni and cheese . Why ? Because Emili and I are STARVING =D 
I totally forgot about the part tomorrow =P Epic fail ? I think so . 
Well ... today was fun . Seeing my friends made me happy =) 
Happy 24th Anniversary mom and dad =D Yay ! I get to celebrate the birth of < PROPFEMALE > and the beginning of your marriage on the same day . Haha =] 
I think I'm going to bed early tonight ... 
<3

In memory of every cancer patient , family member , & friend who has \ 
lost their battle with cancer and those who continue to conquer it !! Put\ 
this up for 1 hour if you know someone who has or had cancer . Many \ 
won't copy & paste . I did . Will you ? 
I can't believe the news coverage being given to < PROPFIRST > Lohan-a spoiled 20-something year old . Here are a few 20 year-olds worth knowing about : < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > 23 , < PROPFIRST > Linley 29 , < PROPFIRST > Weikert 29 , Justus Bartett 27 , Dave < PROPFIRST > 21 , < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > 21 , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > 26 , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > 23 , < PROPFIRST > Goeke 23 , & < PROPMALE > Tate 27 . These 20-somethings gave their lives for you this week . Honor THEM by reposting this . 
I love when I say a your face joke and it ends up being a compliment . 
This is a boring day . 
Listening to mad old rock and making fun of people XD I love this place . And now Em's screaming over < PROPFIRST > from TDG . He's kinda hot XD 
Watching Comedy Central in the basement . It's not too bad outside here . It's less than a 106 at least . 
I got a headache like no other >.< 
Tosh . 0 . Bed soon . I have a freakin horrible headache tonight . 
I'm fine with people usually and how they choose to live isn't my business , fine . But I wish you'd take the hint that I'm not going to be around you when all you do is drink all night long and do drugs . Get a life . 
So finished my book =) it ended up being 152 pages which rocked , I thought I'd have pushing it to get to 150 for some reason . I've got it placed into manuscript form and I'm ready to send it off for publishing (= 
I'm having a conversation with cleverbot XD 
I love how we're all ready for school to start and then when it's days away we're like NO ! lol . I hate thinking that I have to actually sleep . -.- 
The funniest thing in the world is to look over things you thought were cool when you were younger , only to figure out how stupid you really were . 
I hads lots of fun hanging out with < PROPFIRST > tonight =) Senior pics tomorrow <3 Woot ! 
Senior pictures turned out freakin ' awesome . Now I just have to decide which one is the bestest . 
Today was pretttyyyyyy good , not gonna lie . 
I think it's funny how people think it's fun to make out with their bf/gf and take pictures of it and then plaster it all over facebook . Gross . 
Homecoming week 2010 = best ever =P I loveeee this . Seeing < PROPFIRST > in a dress was priceless . 
Dero = Hot in < PROPMALE > and English <3 I love Oomph ! =) 
So I learned that making yourself go back to sleep for a couple hours is bad . You tend to have very very bad disturbing unwanted dreams . The sad thing is , I know I'll think of it all day . 
Movies tonight with my loves Sara <3 
I wish that we could just snap our fingers and things would work our way . I need < PROPFEMALE > for this . But I just want it now . 
Getting past something and seeing the good within it all is difficult . But if I keep repeating it to myself , I might just hold my head above the water . 
Strassenbash was fun , even though like nobody bought our stuff haha . It was still nice . Long dayyyyy . 
Grr ... I normally love school but I just want to not go tomorrow . 
There's always a little glimmer of hope in her eyes <3 
I just wonder whats up ahead because it seems everything I think is right and belongs in my future doesn't . I wish I could gaze into my life as far forward as I wanted ... just to see if you're there . 
How did we meet ? Copy this as your status and see who remembers . 
What's the point in having ' friends ' when they're not real ? I'm so tired of holding everyone's bs on my shoulders but when it comes to my problems , everyone runs . At least it's easy to tell who's worth my time anymore . 
Steelers are kicking some Buccaneer asssss =) < PROPFIRST > Batch is rockin ' it-which I didn't expect . And Heinz < PROPMALE > is being amazing as usual . This is a pretty good game . 
I wish that during all the yelling at me you'd think of the fact this is it . I'll be gone before you know it . And when you look around and I'm not there anymore , you might realize that a few good memories could've replaced this world of hurt . 
Emili is here (= <3<3 
Oh dearrrrr . 
Google <3 
I'm in more of a giving up mood tonight . 
I think he can see through everything but my heart ... 
Left 4 Dead , Team Fortress 2 , and Emili make for an awesome weekend . <3 Mall later =) 
Things in life need to be easier . Got a lot on my mind today and I'm not enjoying it . I wish there wasn't school tomorrow . I think I need time to figure out what's going on with life . 
I have two ridiculous things to draw for English ... I highly doubt these are going to look anything like what they should . It's actually a miracle if I finish them . My temper tends to take over ... 
Pictures =) I turn 18 in like 4 days XD I'm super excited . And my protest is soon !!! XD I love October <3<3 
18th birthday on Monday and my silent protest is FINALLY here on Tuesday . I love that day ! 
Arghhh ... this weekend needs to go faster ! Especially today . Steelers play tomorrow (= 
Synyster Gates = most amazing man alive ... considering Rev died . I'm going to miss A7X =( 
Woot =) I'm finally 18 <3<3 
Perhaps one of the best birthdays < PROPFEMALE > =) I feel old though hehe . Party is over though ... english homework beckons . 
Feeling overwhelmed tonight , but that's okay . That's what life is all about right ? 
I'm super excited for this weekend . Except for the fact there's no Emili ! I miss her ='( 
Thanks to < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFIRST > , this day was the most amazing of my entire life . I'm still high with happiness and I don't think I'll ever come down ^.^ I love you guys sooooo much <3<3 
This weekend has been the best of my life =) Thanks to all my friends and family who made this birthday the best so far . I missed Emili hardcore ! But next weekend we're gonna live it up =) 
Gaze into her killing jar I'd sometimes stare for hours . She even poked the holes so I can breathe . She bought the last line , I'm just the worst kind of guy to argue with what you might find . And for the last night I lie , could I lie with you ? Pull the plug but I'd like to learn your name and holdin ' on well , I hope you do the same . Aww , sugar , slip in to this tragedy you've spun this chamber dry . 
Dear College Algebra , #@ ! & you and all your algebraness . If you were a real object , I'd hit you with a baseball and then stab you repeatedly . Then and ONLY then would I ever feel satisfied . 
Applying for jobs , anyone know of any place hiring ? Even if its seasonal ... 
Lack of anything to do but follow the election results , play video games , and watch Glee . I can't wait til the Glee auditions =/ 
I almost want to give up on my generation . Their lack of care towards anything that effects them . All that matters to them is their technology , cars , and friends . I can't wait to see that more than a handful of us are mature . 
Yeaaaa . I got like five essays assigned today and no time to do them ... yay ? At least I have < PROPMALE > class tomorrow =) It's like a break from reality haha . 
3 Years old : my mom is the best ! 7 years old : Mom I love you . 10 yrs old : Mom whatever . 17 yrs old : OMG my mom is so annoying . 18 yrs old : I wanna leave this house . 30 yrs old : I wanna go back to my mom's house . 50 yrs old : I don't wanna lose my mom . 70 yrs old : I would give up everythingfor my mom to be here with me . Post this on your wall if you appreciate your mom 
\It's get smart or get dead .. It's that damn simple . \ " - < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > " 
World of Warcraft takes entirely too long to download . Does Blizzard not understand we need it NOW ? =/ 
Staying up this late playing wow either means I have no life or an epic one . Your choice . 
I have an interview tomorrow at 4 =) I'm excited now . 
I'm nervous for my speech tomorrow ... yet excited . An interesting mixture . I hope a lot of veterans show up and this all goes well . It'd be really cool =) 
So I think my speech went quite well today =) I was nervous ... I'm pretty sure people noticed . Thank you to all the Veterans and those currently serving ! 
<3 =) 
\I just hit an extreme patch of lag ! \ " -Me \ " No ... that's an earthquake ... \"- Emili . World of Warcraft failed me . Lol ^.^ " 
I want Deals to call me =/ I want my job . I want to start now . 
Today felt like my day from hell . It was too long and I didn't get anything done the way it should've been . I guess everyone slacks off one day ? 
I really can't wait to go to work Saturday =) 
=) Yay ! Work was fun haha . 
Tornado watches in Winter ? I could get used to this ^.^ 
Thankgiving is a beautiful holiday when used for what it's worth . It's more than food , it's being thankful for everything we have in our lives even if it isn't much . I am so thankful for my friends and family in my life , they mean so much to me . Today is the perfect day to count your blessings . <3 
Ahhh , long night of work . Time to unwind and relax . 
Hello work . 
Today = stressful . 
Off work ... finally . 
Is married to < PROPFEMALE > Ladd 
Inbox me a number between 1-1000 and ill update my status with your number and what I like about you ... 
#667 : When I first met you I thought you were a little crazy . You were very outgoing and at that point in my life I was super timid haha . But especially over this semester I've learned you're a really good person who's been through a lot of stuff you didn't deserve to live through . You've definitely made 1st Semester of my Senior year memorable and I'm going to miss you hardcore when you leave . 
#665 : Avenged Sevenfold for life , my dear friend . You are an amazing person all around . Very inspiring and one of the few people our age who has brains . Your creativity and personality are extraordinary . If I didn't know you many things would happen . < PROPMALE > would suck more . I would feel alone in my love for Rev . And I'd be missing a spectacular person in my life =) 
#999 . 999999992 : You're a really intelligent person filled with some pretty amazing facts that I'd never have known without you sharing them . You've got an awesome sense of humor and make < PROPMALE > class entertaining . You're definitely an awesome < PROPMALE > ist , haha . You've got good ideas to survive the zombie apocalypse except for shooting our dogs and possibly me ... but you've correctly chosen your weapons . 
Send me a number between 1-1000 pleaseeeee . I'm sure I can make you love yourself like ten times more . Hahaha . 
111 : You're an awesome uncle who is very wise and caring . A true family man and hard worker in his life . Horrible at picking the right college football team or NFL team ... but we won't go there today . 
Welllll , home from work . That was like the least amount of effort I put into work in ever ... is Christmas over yet ? 
Bed ... work in the AM . 
Tired ... my mom took the car so I'm waiting for her to come back so that I may go to work . Why doesn't this seem like a good thing ? 
So , I discovered I CAN drive on snow but slowly . I watched some guy totally lose control of his truck . It made me laugh . 
Most people have 1000 wishes for Christmas ; a cancer patient only has one , to get better . I know 97% of you won't repost this to your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do . In honor of someone who has died , or is still fighting , or survived cancer , copy this to your status 
We got our first snow day and I'm sick ... no bueno . I kinda want school to be cancelled tomorrow too . Just because I want some free rest before work tomorrow night . 
Tonight was fun =) Btw-Facebook official ... Tina is the BEST waitress at iHop in Wentzville . I'll post pictures of proof tomorrow . I got a paper to write ... >.> 
On the east coast , it's past midnight ... James < PROPMALE > Sullivan has been gone from this Earth for a year on 12.28.10 . My fellow Avenged Sevenfold fans understand the pain this brings to our hearts today . The Rev , best drummer in the world . Nobody could take his spot and nobody will . To the best man to have ever lived : we miss you . 
ZOMG I watched Serenity , the movie for Firefly ... just omg . Anyone from Brophy's scifi class HAS TO WATCH IT . NOW . STOP SLEEPING !!! WATCHHHHH !!!!!! 
Ummmm , so any idea if tomorrow is blue or gold day ?? 
Yay =) < PROPFIRST > was at school today =) 
Thanks for voting for me guys =) those who did ! I'm a state finalist for the hero scholarship ! I'm super excited ! 
So happy for a snow day ... I needed a day of sleep . <3 
Gonna watch a movie with the fam . I'm feeling a little bit better ... I'm really REALLY tired of being sick . I miss civilization . 
I'm almost positive there's not going to be school tomorrow ... considering there's a winter storm warning and they're callin ' for 6-7in . I'm pretty sure we're gonna be home ... 
American Idol starts tonight =D my life is amazing again . 
OH MY GOSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ! WE DID IT ! STEELERS ARE GOING TO THE SUPERBOWL XD OMG ! I think I'm gonna pass out . 
No school ... again . This is getting old . 
BROTHER'S WEEK !!!! If you have a brother who has made you laugh , punched you , stuck up for you , drove you crazy , annoyed you to no end , hugged you , watched you succeed , saw you fail , picked you back up , cheered you on , made you strong , and is someone you are very proud to have in your life , re-post this to your status . 
Too much on my mind . 
I hate trying to decide what phone I want ... I think I might just go into a store for my upgrade . All the reviews make me happy , then nervous . 
I hate when you're so bored that all that's left to do is sleep but you're not tired enough to do it ... I can't wait to see Emili tomorrow . <3 
I can't wait for my boys to win tonight =) I'm so pissed I have to work most of the game . I wish I could just call in ... 
I really don't think I've ever felt this bad in my entire life . It was a good game , Steelers ... those effing turnovers >.< 
Sooo where's a good place in the area to get your haircut ? That's not overly priced ... I really want to get it done soon because it's just getting on my nerves butttt I don't necessarily trust great clips anymore >.> 
Wednesdayyyy is scary >.< 
Work soon =/ 
So the US Supreme Court has ruled that you have the right under the First Amendment to protest military funerals ... I invite you to start your protest in my front yard and we can see if your first amendment is better than my Second Amendment ! 
Shooting bows is addictive >.> 
The talent show was super fun =) I'm really happy haha <3 Everyone who performed did AMAZING ! Good job guys <3<3
