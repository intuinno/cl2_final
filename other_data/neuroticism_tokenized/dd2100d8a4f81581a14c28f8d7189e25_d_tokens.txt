hey everyone , so im in florida and its so amazing !!!! the weather is perfect and the beach is so fun ! so far the military life is great , i really cant get enough , i love it .... i can say the worst part is not getting to see all of my wonderful friends .... you guys cant be replaced !!! not sure when ill be home but when i get there youll all know .... i wish you were here !!!! 
well today i got to sleep in for the first time in what seems like forever and it was awesome !!!! i dont have work today so its off to the gym then the beach with my new friends !!!!!!!! 1 
well everyone , ive been having alot of fun right ? yea ... wel about half way through my day after i got sone with volleyball i relized how much i miss my real home ...... this place will be home for a few months and its cool and everything but i miss you all and would really rather be back in camdenton with everyone i know and love .... yes im living in florida and im feeling down !!!!

man dog duty is kinda boring .... i cant leave the barracks at all . but i do get to shill with my friends ... and sunday we get to have a bbq and you will find me eating to playing sand volleyball . 
i dont understand why people complain so much about having to do a watch ... its not like its that fu#*ng hard .... all i have to say is it you have a problem with having duty and having to stand a watch then you need to get out of the military !!!! 
i cant believe i missed that call ... thats the worst think that could have happened ... not sure when ill hear from him again !!!! sad sad sad day !!!! 
so my honeys on the ship and it sucks but he called this morning and should be calling again tonight !!! 
so i cry a little more , laugh alot less and feel very lost ... when i read and hear about everyone living life in the real world or others going home ...... i sit back and wonder why i do this .... ill be alone for at least another month ,,, and thats a month to long .... in this place .... 
so i just found out today in class that when i get to the ship i have to get qualified on a 50 cal . machine gun !!!!! how many people can they can do that ??? 
ok so i hope everyone at home missed me because im coming home the 9th for 10 days before its off to VA .... woot woot no more n.a.s !!!!! 
im excited but aslo torn ... the close time gets for me to leave the more i think about saying goodbye to the friends i have made in this place ! it will suck to say goodbye but its a small world as i can prove firdt hand andill see you all again .... and other the other hand normal life here i come

2 camels in a < PROPFEMALE > car !!!! 
three day weekend and nothing to do !!!!!!!! this sucks 
so people suck ... like big time . funny , they tell you trust nobody .... this is why i see it now . it doesnt matter who you are or where you came from . it could be your worst enemy do to your best friend ... but then again they would be your best friend doing crap like this , yes !!! i think i proved a point !!!!!! 
the whole trust thing is over rated . id rather be alone than be friends with someone i cant trust . atleast that way i know ive got my back 
got to love drama huh ? i think not ! dont go thinkin everything will be better tomorrow cuz i doubt it ! good people are a rare find and you wont find many here 
come what may .... im as ready as ill ever be ... and ive got time 
what are we doing here , we feed off the weak to survive , we take for granted everything we are given , and we have forgotten the way ....... 
without trust we are alone , with loneliness there is no love , with out love we cannot live 
mmmmmm ..... pickle 
wow my finger hurts 
ok so the last two weeks has been made up of alot of 10 to 11 hour days at work ..... then sleeping lots of sleeping yet still not enough ..... im wore out , but theres more to come 
soft ball game tomorrow , bbq , and co-workers , should be interesting .... 
cant talk to you cuz im ashamed , i dont know what to say or even do . this is the time to start over and show you that i can this right 
oi , irritating day at work , failed room inspection and falling up the stairs , whats next ? 
they say all is fair in love and war but we wont need to fight it , we'll get it right and be united ... and i know someday it'll all work out and ill work to work it out and i promise you kid that ill give so much more than i get , yeah .... i just havent met you yet 
i have no idea what to do today ... 
the greatest thing youll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return ! 
oh man what am i doing ? im going out of my mind im so bored ... 
always be yourself cuz the people that matter dont mind , and the people that do mind dont matter 
The clack of life is but wound once , and no man has the power to tell just when the hands will stop , at late or early hour . Now is the only time you own . Live , love , and toil with a will . Place no faith in time . For the clock may soon be still . 
so people are just stupid ... they think they know someone but really they have no idea .... so i hope those people and get hurt cuz they are asking for it and when they do im gonna laugh .... 
saw inception ... it was awesome ..... and so was the rest of today to say the least ..... woot woot i have a good friend and i relized today all at once jusst how much i miss my family .... all of them !!!! 
im tired but im to bored to sleep .... im random because its entertaining but you cant be random alone ... so im in a pickle .... mmm pickles ... 
if common sense was common everybody would have it ... 
a sharp tongue is no indication of a keen mind 
ok so ....... i cant wait ,,, for what i dont know but i cant ..... maybe its for something better 
im tired but i have so muc to do ... why cant life be a little easier ? people suck !!! 
so im moved in to my new room ... its nice .... and ive already made new friends but ive learned that you cant put your full trust in people right away .... now its time to relax and hope it keeps getting better !!!! 
cant wait for tomorrow ..... its gonna be friday .... im going to see a movie ... then im ganna chill with my girl < PROPFEMALE > at my new place ... what ever else the weekend bring is to be decided .... :-) 
well ... waiting for my friend so we can go see our movie .... just layin around eating ice ... maybe ill take a nap .... 
it was nice to get off of work at 12 ... my new division isnt so bad ... they are really helping me out to get my stuff done 
...... oy'vey 
gonna chill with my girl cyngier ..... she pretty much the poo !!! :-) 
and rather than flaunt my style id flash you a smile of clean < PROPFEMALE > whites ... 
golf and alcohol dont mix and thats why i dont drink and drive ... 
this life just might be the one i was made for ... good job , great friends , and a loving family ... yes there may be some drama but you'll have that anywhere you go .... life is grand .... live it up !!!!!!!!!!! 
ok so life is good .... labor day weekend im heading to d.c. after duty to see some family with my homie .... natalia ..... and this week should be filled with fun just has i have planned

so its taken me a long time to relize there was some reason my mother would get mad when i didnt take her advice .... she said she been through all of it and told me how it would turn out ... she was always right .... take your moms advice it will save you the trouble

if a relationship has to be a secret , you shouldnt be in it . 
when it comes to going after what you love , dont take no for an answer 
your job wont take care of you when your sick , your friends and parents will . stay in touch . 
we try to be tough and act like we can handle anything life throws at us , but we need to remember that we are only human .

holy hell .. paranormal activity 2 scary as shit yo .... 2 thumbs but but man im afraid to be alone right now 
moives 
why am i so bored ? 
when you feel like the whole world is against you jsut sit back and laugh , because while you may not get what you want you still have your life and that is enough to look forward to 
bad luck only comes to those that except it 
hahaha ( tears ) : ( 
laughing is a different story when you actually feel like the world really is against you 
what do you do when you dont the way out ? you cant run from your problems , but talking about them doesnt fix it either ... 
uh oh the news is broken oh snap 
i dont have time for people like you ... the ones who think they are the most important , well little do you know your just a waste of my time ...... get some assholes 
while you sit there and try to figure out where you went wrong i already know , so ill be busy moving on 
movie night with the best girl ever . the boys come home tomorrow 
i was planning on porting some really cool on facebook , unfortunatly i have nothing to say . so ill try again later 
what is the point in making us stay at work if for 1 we have no work and for 2 we dont have enough people to do work even if we had work to do ? makes no sense 
epic fuckin fail 
i knew something was bound to mess up my day it just took longer than usual 
being bored sucks people 
busch gardens today should fun 
Well I think I'm the wheel tonight . Great 
Tonight didn't turn out so bad . I think tomorrow the haunted house will be worse 
I wonder why people do and say what they do but don't realize that maybe just maybe they should take there own advice . On some really shit , its pissing me off 
Don't try to run my life when You can't even run your own 
Haunted house tonight .... 
In the end we ate all just lines of chalk on the concrete just waiting to be washed away 
OMG I think the haunted house scared the shit out of me 
I need to go home . You always learn the hard way that your the only person who can truly take care of yourself . If that's the case try with anyone else ? 
When can the face of the world just fall off 
Only I can do me .. 
Maybe it's time to change and leave it all behide 
If water was vodka and I was a duck I would go under and never come up , bur water isn't vodka and I'm not a duck so pour the damn shot and shut the f% #k up 
< PROPMALE > to the mess deck 
Gonna shine my boots then go to bed 
The difference between u and I is ur weak and im not . I make mistakes but u cause disasters . Watch out here comes the end of ur world and the beginning of mine . 
when you feel like the whole world is crashing down dont give up the fight , ou will come out alive , on top and not alone 
12 hour shifts suck but i have the next 2 days off work .... time to make it count 
i want to thank those who served to let us have our freedom i hope to follow in the same path . thank you to my family for supporting me and believing i could make it this far 
Today is veterans day . Ihop 20% off for military applebees free chili's free subway free sweet 
It's hard to find good people like really good people I have now learned that the best people are your family 
people will mess with you as much as possible if they arent happy with there lives but what they dont know is whats coming to them will be much worse and im the end all that matters is your life is still good 
what more could you ask for when everything is really going right ... im at the top of the world with everything i could ask for and the support of my loved ones right up there with me 
Q : where should I put this ? 
Squid pro quo lol 
How much wood could a wood < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > if a wood < PROPMALE > could < PROPMALE > wood ?

For at this moment my family is everything and people just don't seem to understand that
