I was young and caught in the crowd . I didn't know then what I know now . I was dumb , and I was proud . And I'm sorry . 
Mexican , margaritas & gossip is better than working out w/ my bestie Alizah < PROPMALE > any day !! :D 
It's GORGEOUS out & I'm dying to find some nice weather clothes that fit me so I can go enjoy it !! 
omg . happy monday ya'll ... 
Glad to know I'm not the only one who keeps forgetting about tomorrow being Mother's Day ... the card aisel at the store was picked bare & I was only one of a couple dozen vultures vying for the leftovers ! ( Though I was the only MOM I saw there ... ) 
Looking to find a happy & healthy home for my cats - 2 affectionate , adult fat orange tabby cats & a 1 yr old playful siamese - they're all very smart & respond to their names ! 
Somehow I managed to get my keys & drive to work , while forgetting my cell phone , purse , pager , wallet , and all things important at home ! 
I have never seen fog like this at 3 in the afternoon !

At Home Depot in dirty stallis wearing a dress & heels ... hit on by 3 old men & ogled by many more . ew .

torrential downpours + trapped inside my apt in Shorewood = every floor in my house swept & mopped 
saddest moment of my weekend : when I opened up my to-go meal from cb to make tomorrow's lunch and see that < PROPFEMALE > Becker gave me chicken instead of beef !! :( 
goin to see < PROPMALE > Laswell at Turner Hall , thursday night 8 pm , for $10 . Who's comin with me ?? 
Leaving work early for once yay ! You know it's bad when the night cleaning lady passes on the sidewalk & asks why I'm not at work still !? 
Well it's definitely Friday the 13th ... at least it's almost over & I'm on vacation for a week , yay ! 
Yet another change in vacation plans , but now that we got our camp all set up at Devil's Lake , all is right in my world :)

There will come a time , you'll see , with no more tears , and love will not break your heart , but dismiss your fears . 
zucchini carrot muffins = SUCCESS !!! 
Home from work with 2 sick kiddos ... a day on the couch watching streaming netflix kids movies 
cannot possibly put into words how bad my day was today , except that I would rather be umemployed , broke , hungry and homeless , than go back to work tomorrow ... 
Will someone please tell me why I am only leaving green bay now ?? Oh , maybe because my early drive to & from gb turned into a later drive to & from crivitz ?! Grrrr ... 
Feeling like I'd like to throw a little temper tantrum ... soooo not ready for Monday tomorrow ! 
My horoscope says I should decide what's worth my while and what's not , it's time to shake things up , and I've been stagnating for too long due to responsibilities I've taken on . Just the sign I've been looking for ! 
One of the kids accidentally bumped the iHome and a song came on out of the blue ... Hole ... immediately my 5 year old started playing air drums . Lol where do they learn this stuff ?! 
It's difficult , but look for a silver lining ... for instance , now we can look forward to the possibility of somebody competent filling the position of county exec ... any other suggestions ? I'm fresh out : ( 
Good Mourning Democrats . To paraphrase someone or another , from here on out , your day only gets worse ! 
finished draft #1 of my statement of purpose .... now just need < PROPFIRST > Henke to edit that beast for me ... please and thanks < PROPMALE > : ) 
But you , you’ve taken all of my dreams and melted them to stone , and you’ve skipped them across the water and they’re gone ... But you , you gave me nothing at all but hope when I was weak , and now you’re gone , I played along , and I’m alone ... 
Good start to the weekend ... you can call me the newest student of Marquette's graduate school !!! :D 
Heet & starter spray ... $5 , tow truck that never showed up ... -$160 , new distributer cap ... $15 , MY DAD ... priceless !! :) 
CRAM TIME !! ... taking the GRE tomorrow : / 
hmmm . A quick google search tells me that I just imbibed approximately 600 calories in the form of one whole bottle of wine . oops . 
So it's official - Packers @ Bears next week for the NFC championship game ... only the second time ever - should be EPIC !
