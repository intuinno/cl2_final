Sigh ... \ 
1 day till a hellhole reception ... 
I wish I had something to do right now ... 
Ugh , i'm < PROPFEMALE > bored right now . 
I'm playing falldown on my ipod right now ... 
Say < PROPFEMALE > Q really fast to someone you love ... 
Mad because he can't fix his own Ipod touch :(

( Guitar Hero : World Tour for the non gamers ) 
Omg , powers out again !!! 
Yay power is back :) \ 
I still wonder how that power pole caught fire though ... o_O 
Another power pole caught fire ... I dont think that is a coincedence anymore !!! 
My only excuse this year is that I got a doctors note saying I got clinical boredom ... lol 
\School ... \ " \ 
Going home after the BBQ pros : got a free soda , cons : food was average 
Varsity wins Battle of the Sexes !!! 
I'm such a fatass , I'm eating 4 pounds of banana pudding right now ....... 
Mythbusters = On right now :) 
I just woke up to someone playing < PROPFIRST > beiber outside , my day is officially ruined ... 
wishes he wasn't a introvert . 
I post on everyone else's walls and no one posts on mine ... \ 
I feel horrible now :( 
Facebook is where rumors start ... \ 
Rumors start fights ... \ 
Fights end with breakups ... \ 
Breakups end with HeartBreaks ... \ 
Heartbreaks end with pain ... \ 
Pain is where facebook lies and shall stay there forever ... 
wonders how the hell are there skinny chicks out there that eat twice as much as me ... 
Omg i just saw the cataclysm trailer on tv my day has improved by 85% 
I'll never get how we are a desert but we snow by the feet 
Gah , I'm sick and tired of having practically no friends ... This is frustrating ... Damnit ... 
I have got to get rid of my self destructive socially timid personality ... But how ... 
I wonder if I should spend $1k on myself this christmas ... 
Bah Lopez's class is boring ... 
Sometimes I wonder how tall I look in other peoples eyes ... 
So , does anyone have a clue if there is school tomorrow ? \ 
Or when the highway opens up ? 
Wtf ? \ 
Did anyone other then me just get a call from ( 666 ) 666-6666 ? \ 
Creepy much ? 
Watching grownups with my mom .. I'm laughing my ass off lol ... 
A happy Thanksgiving to those who read this , and a happy turkey day to those who don't ... 
Lolz I R < PROPMALE > , I ate prime rib instead of turkey :P 
Gah epic belly sliding in the snow :) 
Does Verizon Wireless have 3G service in Wendover ? 
Sigh , B day at school tomorrow ... \ 
:/ 
Sigh , I'm bored ... 
Frostbite is more itchy then a mosquito bite :/\ 
Why ? 
Just watched Vampires Suck\ 
Grossed out but still laughing on my ass ... :P 
Vampires Suck Quote :\ 
Edward : \Don't do anything reckless . \ " \ 
At Layton ( North of Salt Lake City ) in the Layton Hills Mall and I have an extremely bad case of vertigo right now ... :( 
Bah WTH why does Evans think I have tourettes ?

Hey everyone come to the game tonight . \ 
WWHS vs . Jackpot\

$5.00 Adults\ 
$3.00 Seniors\ 
Kids under 5 are free . 
Why is it when someone tells me to come over to fix their computer , it doesn't even have a problem ...? 
Did you know it's impossible to < PROPMALE > your head forward and back with your mouth open ? 
It's snowing ... AGAIN ... \ 
sigh ... 
Is listening to vinyls ... \ 
( Yes , I have a record player ) 
I'm stuck on a math equation for my game :/\ 
Gah ... Frustrating :( 
Who else thinks it's ironic that Las Vegas is flooding ? \ 
http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2010/dec/22/flash-flood-warning-issued-north/ 
So , I have no presents this year ... Kinda furious ... \ 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas to all ... 
Isn't it awkward how both \Satan\ " and \ " Santa\ " are both spelled with the same five letters ? " 
If pros are the opposite of cons , what's the opposite of progress ? \ 
How about constitution ? 
Surprisingly no one was on Facebook during school except me ! :P 
Wow McDonalds now serves oatmeal on their breakfast menu ... \ 
What did they do ? Drop a bucket of Crisco on some oats and called it oatmeal ? 
Watchin my little boebot wander around in my room like a blind cat ... 
Finally got my phone fixed ... Texting feels so awkward now ... 
I saw the biggest lie ever on TV ... \ 
< PROPFIRST > Beiber uses Proactive for his acne ... \ 
Dude I bet that kid still thinks acne is just the bomb company from Coyote and Roadrunner\ 
( P.S. Yes I know it's called Acme from Coyote and Roadrunner ... ) 
So , I'm currently curious if I passed my finals or not , but sadly POWERSCHOOL IS FREAKING DOWN ! So , why do I look surprised ? It's because Elko needs to upgrade their dang computers ... if they crash everyday ! 
I sorta miss when everyone posted their entire life on Facebook ... Now it's just breakups and crap ... 
Havin fun during concessions with < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , Yasira , and < PROPMALE > 
So , I just ate some delicious spaghetti ;) \ 
Life just got a little bit better :) 
I have actually found something to do , write a bio on myself ... \ 
This is actually proving much harder then I originally thought . \ 
Anyone have anything I should probably mention in the before mentioned bio ? 
I'm with < PROPMALE > right now , so far he is okay , no signs of concussion . \ 
< PROPFIRST > vs . < PROPMALE > 
is wondering if he should pay $55 a month for a fiberoptic Internet connection ... \ 
( 12mbit/s tunnel)\ 
For the non geeks , I'm looking into buying Internet the same speed as the school . 
is currently working on the schools website , do you guys want something special ? 
I want that red 426hp convertible Camaro ... \ 
Green Bay all the way ! 
So , how many people watched CSI where < PROPFIRST > Beiber dies ? \ 
I did ! 
Donkey basketball is over ... 
I am antisocial . 
You think you know a person is nice but they really know how to hurt you . \ 
:'( 
Is out searching for Mickie . \ 
Im with the search party 
Meeting at the city hall for a debriefing for tomorrow's plan . 
The search party found a body a little bit outside of town . They haven't disclosed who it is yet . \ 
Cross your fingers and let's hope it's not < PROPFIRST > . 
To help clear up the controversary :\ 
There was a body found around the 3 mile area , \ 
We still do not know who it is . \ 
The police will probably not disclose the information until there are 100% sure . \ 
The first people to know will be her parents . \ 
\ 
Let's all pray that it isn't Mickey . \ 
Please post this to your statuses to help clear up the confusion . 
Now I wonder if the school is going to postpone the HSPE ... \ 
I hope so , because I know I won't be able work through them with a clear mind . 
Wow some idiot keeps trying to login to my Facebook using passwords like cheese ... :/\ 
What an idiot ... 
Candle lighting for Our friend < PROPFIRST > tomorrow at 6 at WWHS ! Paste into your status and pass the word 
I have a dilemma ... I have no green to wear ... \ 
:( 
How I like my coffee :\ 
80% Milk\ 
5% Coffee\ 
15% Sugar ... :P 
Hey , don't write yourself off yet\ 
It's only in your head you feel left out or looked down on . \ 
Just try your best , try everything you can . \ 
And don't you worry what they tell themselves when you're away . \ 
-- < PROPFIRST > Eat World 
I just installed Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010 , The icons seriously confuse me . \ 
The interface is like crazily revamped and it hurts my eyes ... \ 
( I think it's because I'm using Windows XP :P ) 
Las Vatos should join Football next year ? \ 
< PROPFIRST > Collazo < PROPFIRST > Landeros < PROPFIRST > Cornejo < PROPFIRST > Blundy ? 
Today I have learned something :\ 
I seriously suck at flirting ... 
I am antisocial . \ 
Before you post anything about that , read what it means . 
So , when the hell is Evans going to put my damn test in ? 
September , 11th = World Trade Center Crash\ 
January , 11th = Haiti Earthquake\ 
March , 11th = Japan Earthquake\ 
12/21/2012 When the world will end -> 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 11 
Why is Powerschool down ? \ 
Yet , I have a better question ... When is Powerschool not down ? 
Don't you hate it when you go to Facebook chat someone and they suddenly log out right when you're about to press enter ? 
Don't you hate it when you're in the middle of a conversation and the other person falls asleep ? 
Goodnight Facebook and all the mystical adventures that happen within . 
Another fun conspiracy theory :\ 
9-11-01 + 3-10-11 = 12-21-12 
Lol , I have 3 computers on my desk , ones running Windows Xp , ones running Windows 7 , and the last one is running Ubuntu ( Linux ) ... \ 
I guess the timeline looks nice ;) 
According to a online reading test I read 595 wpm ... \ 
Vs my typing speed which is an average of 65 wpm ... 
I am getting ready to go to Skills ... \ 
^I'm at school ... :/ 
Bought $71 skullcandy skullcrushers . 
On the way to the dance ! 
Since I haven't been at school , what have you misfits been doing ? 
I hate my life . If that's even what I want to call the little bit of one I have . 
has a new perspective on life . \ 
First of all , all haters can f * off ... \ 
Secondly , I have new ideas on tolerance of people . \ 
Third , I feel a greater need to enjoy what is left of my life . 
New respect for Japanese Screamo :D \

I was listening to Pandora and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > - < PROPFIRST > came on ... \ 
Now I have a better realization of who my friends are ... :P \ 
Testing people is a fun pastime :) 
Lesson learned : NEVER TELL ANYONE YOUR F'IN SECRETS\ 
>.< 
Resisting to press send on a message I have been waiting to send for 3 hours in damn near impossible , but somehow I'm managing to do so ... 
Just came back from watching Unknown . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > are awesome :D \ 
( And < PROPMALE > was there with us ... )\ 
( Also < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > happened to be there also ) 
I may have just climbed over one of my barricades in life , to you it might be a street curb , but to me it's more like the Great Wall of < PROPFEMALE > . 
Bon matin tout < PROPFEMALE > monde . \ 
For the peop < PROPFEMALE > who don't know French , that's good morning everyone in French . 
Me : Can I use the bathroom ? \ 
Teacher : I don't know , can you ? \ 
Me : When I was using \can\ " I was using its secondary model form as a verbal modifier asking for permission 
My philosophy :\ 
Life is boring . 
Inception was an awesome movie ... \ 
And yes , I finally sat down to watch the entire 3 hour long movie . 
Centracom Internet is blazing fast and cheap ... I'm downloading like 45 things at the same time lol ... 
Why do I have the strange feeling that no one trusts me ? 
On the way to Elko for FBLA . 
Waiting impatiently for my event . 
I love it when my hair is long and when I shake my head , my hair just smacks me in the face :P 
I'm sorry < PROPFEMALE > , and Leyli . \ 
Now I'm probably never going to talk to either of you for the rest of my miserable life , I know I'm screwed up and I am sorry for anything I have caused . \ 
Again , I'm sorry . 
R.I.P. < PROPFIRST > Blundy\
