sometimes i feel like a little kid on christmas morning who just unwrapped the best gift he could possibly imagine . and is then told sorry that ones not for you 
i frickin love cashmere it always feels so good on my skin :-) 
the perfect phrase . one can search his whole life looking for it . in the end you just have letters strung together . with these letters i can make a rock or an ocean . with these words we can wound deeper than any knife . with the right phrase one person can bring another to the soaring heights of joy . be careful how you use this power . -one love
