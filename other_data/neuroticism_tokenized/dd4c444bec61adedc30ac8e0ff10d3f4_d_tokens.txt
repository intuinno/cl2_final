Rejection hurts , especially when it was your best friend .... \ 
Twas a ring of engagement in the childlike mind . \ 
Two lovers of different paths , two tokens of the same heart , one heartbreak that shrouds the soul with an ever darkening cloud of despair . \ 
Lord lift this hurt from my heart , free my soul from despair , clear my mind of bitter thoughts . 
Perfect weather , going outside ! \

Every person has a 1000 wishes but a cancer patient only has one : to get better . I know that 97% will not post this as their status or even acknowledge it . Be one of the 3% to like it , and put this as your status , at least for an hour . Show your support for those who died because of cancer , suffered because of cancer , or are ... still fighting it 
Change your profile picture to a cartoon from your \

I believe in Jesus Christ and have accepted him as my personal savior . One facebooker has challenged all believers to put this on their wall ... In the Bible it says , if you deny me in front of your peers , I will deny you in front of my father at the Gates of Heaven . This is simple .. If you love God and you are not afraid to show it repost this ... Just copy and paste ...
