It's not altruism if the person is your value . You can do nice things for the people you love . Objectivism merely dircourages self-desrtuctive acts .

Are you in a universe which is ruled by natural laws and , therefore , is stable , firm , absolute - and knowable ? Or are you in an incomprehensible chaos , a realm of inexplicable miracles , an unpredictable , unknowable flux , which your mind is impotent to grasp ? The nature of your actions - and of your ambition - will be different , according to which set of answers you come to accept . 
If you have not yet read any books of Ayn Rand's or even at leats articles from her non-fiction works , then I suggest you refrain from speaking about what you think is erroneous in Objectivism . If you cannot give the effort to do research on it , yet are bold enough to critique it with an insufficient understanding of its context , then I cannot give you the benefit of the doubt and listen to such arbitrary HOGWASH ! 
I've done a bit of research into the antagonist's character in the sequal of BIOSHOCK , and I must say ... I HATE < PROPFEMALE > LAMB !!!! ALTUISTS , SUBJECTIVISTS , MYSTICS . . . . Beware , for the Objectivist retaliation is at hand !

You can often distinguish the maturity of a person by knowing what music they listen to . 
Too many people underestimate the power of the mystics of muscle . There must be swift measures taken in the Middle East .

If one does not have an inclusive binary system - binding metaphysics and epystemlogy - and/or it is self-contradicting , then they have no basis for claiming any standard of ethics in its proper consequence . Fallacious systems are always derived by accepting reality as a relative state and the nature of reason to be nagative or limited .

Some believe that history is merely important so that we can learn from the mistakes of our predecessors and improve society -- they will suffer for their lack of vision . We look at history , at archeaology , not only to find the wrongs of the past , but more importantly , the great things . 
A few hindrances to enlightenment : \

In the uproar , the clamor of ' modern ' society -- of our lives , we cannot hear Its calling , we are numb to sense Its presence : Ultimate Wisdom .

The human mind is like a sophisticated arangement of distorted mirrors , always reflecting reality at its own < PROPFEMALE > . And just like the nature of stimulated emission or atomic fusion in macrocosm ; abiding by its identitive nature : predictable , yet capable of much variation depending on the environment and its own critical mass . 
There is not much reason to continue living . Why do we prolong our lives ? What is existential in our biological nature can be decoded as is attachment and greed ( which in application are volitional ) . We are attached to the objects of pleaure and , in fear of losing such , we are greedy over them . That is our purpose : synthetic programming . It is fulfilled thusly .

Lacking its own ingenuity , the parasite fears the visionary . What it cannot plagiarize , it seeks to censor . What it cannot regulate , it seeks to ban .

If they were not limited\ 
but one were to say that the word has an infinite number of meanings , then reasoning would be impossible . Not to\ 
have one meaning is to have no meaning , and if words have no meaning our reasoning with one another , and indeed with\ 
ourselves , has been annihilated ; it's impossible to think of anything if we do not think of one thing ; but if it is\ 
possible , one name can be assigned to this thing .

Never will I need to worry about justifying the impressionist masters to any persons which embody the offspring of minimalism , i.e. greater than ninety percent of modern music ( circa . 1900's - current ) . I like to keep Ravel , Szymanowski , and Shoenberg to myself . 
People need to cease the immaturity regarding sexual content . This applies to those who apprehend such and those who frivolize it .

Life perpetuates itself through diversity ; this includes the ability to sacrifice itself when necessary . Cells repeat the process of degeneration and regeneration until one day they die , obliterating an entire set of memory and information . Only genes remain . Why continually repeat this cycle ? Simply to survive by avoiding the weaknesses of an unchanging system . Your effort to remain what you are is what limits you . 
Existence is a primary : it is uncreated , indestructible , eternal . So if you are to postulate something beyond existence—some supernatural realm—you must do it by openly denying reason , dispensing with definitions , proofs , arguments , and flatly hiding behind faith .
