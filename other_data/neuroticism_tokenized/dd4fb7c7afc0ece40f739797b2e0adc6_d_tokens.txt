Thought of you with love today , but that is nothing new . I thought about you yesterday , and days before that too . I think of you in silence , I often speak your name . All I have are memories and a picture in a frame . Mom your memory is a keepsake , with which I'll never part . God has you in His keeping , I have you in my heart . Repost if you have a loved one in heaven . 
Life is too short to wake up with regrets . So love the people who treat you right . Forget about the ones who don't . Believe everything happens for a reason . If you get a second < PROPMALE > grab it with both hands . If it changes your life let it . Nobody said life would be easy , they just promised it would be worth it ! Post if you agree ! :) 
If it wasn't for crazy people , the world would be a boring place . I like to think that my insanity adds to helping the world become a better place :) 
I'm going to be a Grandma !

He came down the chimney like a bat out of hell I knew right away that fat fucker fell see comment for the rest

A true friend doesn't care when you're broke , or being a bitch , what you weigh , if your house is a mess , what you drive , about your past , or if your family is filled with crazy people . Your conversations pick up exactly where they left off , even if they have been months apart . They love you ... for who you are . Re-post ... if you have at least one ......... true friend . They will know who they are !! :o )\ 
I am blessed !

|The < PROPFEMALE > Truck |” \”; .. 
God saw you getting tired and a cure was not to be . So he put his arms around you and whispered come with me . With tearful eyes , we watched and saw you pass away . Although we love you dearly , we could not make you stay . A < PROPFEMALE > heart stopped beating , hard working hands at rest . God broke our heart to prove He only takes the best ! Put this as your status if there is someone in Heaven you will miss this Christmas
