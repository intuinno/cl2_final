When during sad times an angel should come to you , open your eyes and see who that angel is , for that is your one true love . 
We do not believe in ourselves until someone reveals that deep inside us , something is valuable , worth listening to , worthy of our trust , sacred to our touch . Once we believe in ourselves , we can risk curiosity , wonder , spontaneous delight of any experience that reveals the human spirit . 
goood morningg mondayyy , haha 
Hanging out at the mall , call , text 
i dislike the rain .... :\\ 
Here's to a long life and a < PROPFEMALE > one A quick death and an easy one A pretty girl and an honest one A cold beer and another one ! 
I like being tested . I get as scared as anyone . But the feeling of putting yourself on the line , betting on your talent and having it work ; that’s the most exhilarating feeling in the world . 
Another slow day at the house .. Call or text and maybe we could have some fun . 
as always , with rain follows boredom ... :/ 
Oh , you've gotta live every single day Like it's the only one , what if tomorrow never comes ? Don't let it slip away , could be our only one You know it's only just begun , every single day Maybe our only one , what if tomorrow never comes ? 
Live life fully while you're here . Experience everything . Take care of yourself and your friends . Have fun , be crazy , be weird . Go out and screw up ! You're going to anyway , so you might as well enjoy the process . Take the opportunity to learn from your mistakes : find the cause of your problem and eliminate it . Don't try to be perfect ; just be an excellent example of being human . 
out doing a couple things , then with a real cutie for a bit 
Learn from yesterday , live for today , hope for tomorrow 
hmm , what can i do ..... i feel bored ... 
you've got to be tough when consumed by < PROPFEMALE > ' Cause it's not enough just to stand outside the fire Life is not tried , it is merely survived If you're standing outside the fire 
You can buy a boat and a shiny set of skis Have some fun in the sun , float around in the breeze You can lay out on a blanket by the lake Drink a cold beer , polish off another day Kick on back and watch the sky turn red A sunset aint a sunset Til you put a girl in it . 
You cannot be lonely if you like the person you're alone with . 
I need < PROPFEMALE > get out of the house !! 
Going to < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Andrews house for dinner in a little 
just got home , really enjoyed tonight alot ! going to sleep very soon 
ahhh , such nice weather today , too bad it might rain tomorrow ..... :( 
She's gonna feel that fire The one that lets her know for sure She's everything I want and more Her real < PROPFEMALE > , Is to know I'd walk alone out on the wire Yeah , to make her feel that fire Ohh feel that fire 
Had such a good night/morning I haven't slept yet 
I wanna curl into a ball and die 
why does everything seem to fall apart at the seams everytime it starts to look good ? 
Not everyone knows that we make our own luck , but it's a fact that you count on every day . If some recent setback has brought you down , don't think of it as failure -- instead , see of it as a lesson to help aid your future success . What will you know to do for next time ? Once you've figured it all out , you can go back and tweak your original formula . You're sure to like your results next time . 
I just wish I could see you one more time . :( 
< PROPFEMALE > was a beauty from South Alabama\ 
\ 
Her Daddy had a hard lock and nine pound hammer\ 
Think He even did a little time in the slammer\ 
What was I thinking ? \ 
She snuck out one night and met me by the front gate\ 
Her daddy came out waving that twelve gauge\ 
We tore out the drive , he peppered my tailgate\ 
What was I thinking ? 
I love summer weather ! 
In my head there's only you now\ 
This world falls on me\ 
In this world there's real and make believe\ 
And this seems real to me

She won't ever get enough\

Ughh , stuck at home , boredd ... :/ 
atleast it isn't raining today 
good things happen to those who wait , and , everything that is meant to be will find a way\ 
<33 
Maybe I'm wrong , \ 
But I'm feeling right where I belong 
I have never let anything have this much control over me\ 
I work too hard to call my life my own \ 
And I've made myself a world and it's worked so perfectly\ 
But it's your world now , I can't refuse 
oh you can't stop , Love

True Love Is When Your Heart And Your Mind Are Saying The Same Thing . 
If I hadn't met you , \ 
I wouldn't like you . \ 
If I didn't like you , \ 
I wouldn't love you . \ 
If I didn't love you , \ 
I wouldn't miss you . \ 
But I did , \ 
I do , and I will . 
They say behind every man is a good woman\ 
But I think that's a lie\ 
' Cause when it comes to you I'd rather have you by my side 
I Love You < PROPFEMALE > <3 
I am not PERFECT and this I don't claim to be , \ 
but I am as perfect for you as you are for me 
A man's love cannot be satisfied by beauty alone ; you're more than \ 
beautiful and that's why I love you ! 
Just started camping and I already miss you ... <3 
missing my baby , wish I could see her ..... :/ 
The more connections you and your lover make , not just between your bodies , but between your minds , your hearts , and your souls , the more you will strengthen the fabric of your relationship , and the more real moments you will experience together . 
So this evening turned out to suck .... :( 
i like pancakes !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! that is all :) 
i still like pancakes btw :) thay are awesomeeeeeee !!!!! 
i honestly don't know what to say about what just happenned ............. :/ 
I still love you more than anyone 
Cause when a heart breaks no it don't break even 
Biking around ,.... in west haven , where next , I don't know ... 
The saddest love is to love someone , \ 
to know that they still want you , \ 
but the circumstances don't let you have them . 
why must everyone be busy on such a nice day ?...... :/ 
ARGGHHHHH ......... 
Who wants to do something today ? Hit me up with ideas 
“Do\ 
you want me to tell you something really subversive ? Love is everything\ 
it's cracked up to be . That's why people are so cynical about it . It \ 
really is worth fighting for , being brave for , risking everything\ 
for . And the trouble is , if you don't risk anything , you risk even \ 
more . \ " , 201 0-0 6-13 00:35:40 " 
Someone's dad is such a < PROPMALE > pain in my ass , he should lay off and chill the fuck out !

Gulf beachh , hit me up on my cell if you want to join 
If the pen is mightier than the sword , then , why do actions speak louder than words ? 
who wants to go somewhere and do something tonight ? 
gonee ,... hit up my cell 
No one will ever see me quit , because I simply won't . If I start \ 
something , I will finish it and do it well 
Success seems to be largely a matter of hanging on after \ 
others have let go . 
anyone , plans for this evening ?? 
anyone wanna do something that doesn't involve alot of walking ? 
todays gonna suck , i can feel it already .... :/ 
:D 
Going to Turks for dinner , call or text 
im not tired , im just bored now , haha 
it is never easy for someone to recognize they need something good in their life . what doesn't make sense is \ 
that they continue to say what they want and never realize it is right \ 
in front of their face all along . then , when the person leaves is when\ 
they realize , it was they who they needed from the beginning . \ 
if that person moved on , they missed their < PROPMALE > for having that person\ 
as a blessing in their life 
If I could find you now things would get better\ 
We could leave this town and run forever\ 
I know somewhere , somehow we'll be together\ 
Let your waves crash down on me and take me away 
plans for todayy ? 
yeaaa , working for pepboys now :) 
Te quiero amor mio 
Y voy a\ 
amarte como nadie te ama\ 
Y voy a \

You're holding something just in front of me\ 
Well then , I can't allow this to become another\ 
One of those times that I'm left in the cold , dead\ 
There's no compromise\ 
Just another tie\ 
I know I need to sever 
dont really feel like sleeping even tho it is 3:43 am .. who feels like chatting ? 
When we need to talk turns into let's take a walk . Expect the worst , hope for the best . Even though you know you'll end up like the rest . Standing there in the end with nowhere to turn and nowhere to run . When minutes feel like forever and happiness turns to despair . I look at the past and think , how did this come to be , it used to be you and me standing side by side . Now I stand alone 
Here's to a long life and a < PROPFEMALE > one A quick death and an easy one A pretty girl and an honest one A cold beer and another one !

< PROPFEMALE > Christmas To All And To All A Goodnight ! 
Blizzard Warning until Monday evening , wonderful 
you're the cutest thing I ever did see 
bored , the snow sucks , who wants to do anything ? 
Even the best fall down sometimes . Even the wrong words seem to rhyme . Out of the doubt that fills your mind . You'll finally find , you and I collide 
at the bar 
to sleep of not to sleep , that is the question 
bored , think I'll walk to the mall for now 
All words I sing about\ 
All that is that I write about\ 
Only thing I wanna hear about\ 
So that I can get closer to you\ 
I know that there is someone else , but he's only thinking of himself\ 
Doesn't make any sense for you to be lonely 
Life is too short , so love the one you got\ 
' Cause you might get run over or you might get shot 
Turn it up\ 
It's five minutes to midnight\ 
You're coming home with me tonight\ 
I can't get enough\ 
Shakin ' me up\ 
Alright , at five minutes to midnight\ 
You see our name in city lights\ 
We'll make the clock stop\ 
Make your heart drop and come alive 
Let's start over . \ 
I'll try to do it right this time around . \ 
It's not over . \ 
' Cause a part of me is dead and in the ground . \ 
This love is killing me , \ 
But you're the only one . \ 
It's not over . 
On my knees , I'll ask\ 
Last < PROPMALE > for one last dance\ 
' Cause with you , I'd withstand\ 
All of hell to hold your hand\ 
I'd give it all\ 
I'd give for us\ 
Give anything but I won't give up\ 
' Cause you know , \ 
you know , you know 
If everyone cared and nobody cried\ 
If everyone loved and nobody lied\ 
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride\ 
Then we'd see the day when nobody died 
From the moment I wake up , I just love being with my friends !

She's got eyes of the bluest skies\ 
And if they thought of rain\ 
I hate to look into those eyes\ 
And see an ounce of pain\ 
His hair reminds me of a warm safe place\ 
Where as a child I'd hide\ 
And pray for the thunder\ 
And the rain\ 
To quietly pass me by 
when you are with good friends , immense fun will ensue

Sometimes life comes at you fast . The least you should know is that you can do anything if you try , and that nothing can stop you . You are what you say you are , and no one can take that away from you . Life is that valuable thing that is unique to you . No one can change it ; just you . And endure till the end ! The battles not done till all the men are down . 
people change and things go wrong just remember life goes on

When I see a pretty woman walking down the street\ 
I think about you\ 
Men look her up and down like she's some kind of treat\ 
She wouldn't dare talk to a stranger\ 
always has to be aware of the danger\ 
it doesn't matter who she is\ 
I think about you 
Although I would like our world to change\ 
It helps me to appreciate\ 
Those nights and those dreams\ 
But , my friend , I'd sacrifice all those nights\ 
If I could make the Earth and my dreams the same\ 
The only difference is\ 
To let love replace all our hate\ 
So let's go there\ 
Let's make our escape\ 
Come on , let's go there\ 
Let's ask can we stay ? 
I don't understand why you don't like me\ 
Why don't you like me ? \ 
Am I so different from you\ 
Now does it scare you that I'm able to discern\ 
What to love and what to burn\ 
I'll add your fuel to the fire now\ 
Stand back , brother take your hand back\ 
Leave it and I might crack\ 
More than a smile or two you see\ 
Don't judge what you don't understand\ 
You can't deny what has been given to me 
A sad thing in life is that sometimes you meet someone who means a lot to you only to find out in the end that it was never bound to be and you just have to let go . 
breakfast consisting of home made belgian waffles and bacon ... yuummmmm 
Why do I try , I know I'm gonna fall down . I once thought I could fly , but I only ever drowned

If your SINGLE put this as your status and if someone puts a (?) in your inbox they wanna change that ? ? ? 
When Uncle < PROPFIRST > dips in your pocket\ 
For most things you don't mind\ 
But when your dollar goes to all of those\ 
Standing in a welfare line\ 
Well rejoice you have a voice\ 
If you're concerned about the destination\ 
Of this great nation\ 
It's called the American Honky-Tonk Bar Association 
' Cause all this time I've just been too blind to understand\ 
What should matter to me\ 
My friend , this life we live , it's not what we have\ 
It's what we believe in 
Said , I promise to never fall in love with a stranger\ 
You're all I'm thinkin ' of .. 
A man who is master of himself can end a sorrow as easily as he can invent a pleasure . I don't want to be at the mercy of my emotions . I want to use them , to enjoy them , and to dominate them

just the thought of you can drive me wild

Shine like gold , buzz like a bee\ 
Just the thought of you can drive me wild\ 
Oh , you make me smile 
god , my mind is moving a mile a minute right now ....... 
There's a calm surrender to the rush of day\ 
When the heat of the rolling world can be turned away\ 
An enchanted moment , and it sees me through\ 
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you 
if anyone can make it , I'm betting on me . and you . <3 
When I think of the last time somebody made me feel good .. the last time somebody made me really laugh ... the last time somebody made me happy ... I was with you 
\The one person you can truly love is often right in front of you . \ " & \ " True love is friendship caught on fire . \ " i Believe the these are some of the truest words " 
I'm a man of my convictions . Call me wrong , call me right . But I bring my better angels to every fight . You may not like where I'm going , but you sure know where I stand . Hate me if you want to , love me if you can . 
has had an exceptionally awesome weekend hanging out with one person I missed a lot ! :) 
Oh yeah oh , I wanna be the man in the middle of the night\ 
Shinin ' like it's true\ 
I wanna be the man that you run to whenever I call on you\ 
When everything that loved someone finally found it's way\ 
I Wanna be a better man , I see it in you , yeah , yeah , yeah 
im going to rip AMEX a new one 
If I gave you my hand would you take it\ 
And make me the happiest man in the world\ 
If I told you my heart couldn't beat one more minute without you , girl\ 
Would you accompany me to the edge of the sea\ 
Help me tie up the ends of a dream\ 
I gotta know , would you go with me\ 
I love you so , so would you go with me 
Look , if you had one shot , or one opportunity\ 
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment\ 
Would you capture it ? Or just let it slip ?

Food = happiness right now 
I can go out every night of the week\ 
Can go home with anybody I meet\ 
But it's just a temporary high ' cause when I close my eyes\ 
I'm somewhere with you , somewhere with you 
If you see me out on the town\ 
And it looks like I'm burning it down\ 
You won't ask and I won't say\ 
But in my heart I'm always somewhere with you 
Sleepp

Heaven help the fool who did her wrong\ 
It’s too late , too bad , she’s too far gone\ 
He should’ve thought of that before he left her all alone\ 
If she’s lonely now , she won’t be lonely long 
Yeah a picture paints a thousand words it's true\ 
But it's still not enough for how I feel about you

Lonely is the night when you find yourself alone \ 
Your demons come to light and your mind is not your own \ 
Lonely is the night when there's no one left to call \ 
You feel the time is right -- (say ) the writin's on the wall 
Please vote , Which do you prefer based on the looks of the body , 2004 Mazda rx-8 , or 2000 Mazda rx7

If you love something , let it go . If it comes back to you , its yours forever . If it doesn’t , then it was never meant to be 
Like a gift from the heavens , it was easy to tell\ 
It was love from above that could save me from hell\ 
She had fire in her soul it was easy to see\ 
How the devil himself could be pulled out of me 
Hmm , I feel like I have a couple problems with a certain curly haired fuck that needs a stiff punch in the side of the skull 
I love you , I have loved you all along\ 
And I forgive you for being away for far too long\ 
So keep breathing ? cause I ? m not leaving you anymore\ 
Believe it , hold on to me , never let me go 
Countless words , nor countless actions could ever define my feelings for you . True love defies definition . 
My level of agitation right now is immeasurable , I cannot wait for tonight 
See and this is why you dont tell your girlfriend the password to your account :P 
relaxing at the house with my wonderful girlfriend . <3 
Bar time 
NO CHEATING :\ 
Who wants to come to the blue cube around 7:30 with me ? 
thank you to everyone for the birthday wishes , time to change and go to the bar for a bit , hit me up if you wanna join 
I absolutely love my girlfriend < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Don't ever regret doing anything to get what never left your mind 
Distance never separates two hearts that really care , for our memories span the < PROPMALE > and in seconds we are there . But whenever I start feeling sad , because I miss you , I remind myself how lucky I am to have someone so special to miss . 
You make me smile like the sun\ 
Fall out of bed , sing like bird\ 
Dizzy in my head , spin like a record\ 
Crazy on a Sunday night\ 
You make me dance like a fool\ 
Forget how to breathe\ 
Ohh , you make me smile 
She’d rather wear a pair of cut-off jeans than a fancy evening dress , \ 
And with her windows rolled down and her hair all blown around , she’s a hot southern mess ... <3 
Guess it is mom and girlfriend bonding time , both are laying on couches in the livingroom and don't feel good while I go to work 
Run your mouth when I'm not around\ 
It's easy to achieve\ 
You cry to weak friends that sympathize\ 
Can you hear the violins playing your song ? \ 
Those same friends tell me your every word\ 
Is there no standard anymore ? \ 
What it takes , who I am , where I've been , Belong\ 
You can't be something you're not\ 
Be yourself , by yourself\ 
Stay away from me\ 
A lesson learned in life\ 
Known from the < PROPFEMALE > of time 
No one can make me cry \ 
Make me laugh \ 
Make me smile \ 
Or drive me mad like she does \ 
It's like a curse that is the cure \ 
Better or worse , one thing's for sure \ 
It's real love and I don't know what I'd do \ 
If I lost it . 
I'm gonna be here for you from now on\ 
This you know somehow\ 
You've been stretched to the limits\ 
But it's alright now\ 
And i'm gonna make you a promise\ 
If there's life after this\ 
I'm gonna be there to meet you\ 
With a warm , wet kiss . 
Filling out an app for an apartment in the next couple days , hopefully we will get this place ! <3 
My girlfriend is amazing !! And has the best ideas . I love her <3 
CAR IN < PROPMALE > HOSPITAL PARKINGLOT CAUGHT FIRE , firetrucks and police are there , car is still smoking . 
Every time I see your face\ 
My heart takes off on a high speed chase\ 
Now don't be scared , it's only love\ 
That we're falling in\ 
I would never do you wrong\ 
Or let you down or lead you on\ 
Don't look down , it's only love\ 
Baby , that we're falling in 
My girlfriend is so completely amazing , she shows up to my work with a bag of mcdonalds and a large sweet tea . I love you so much babe ! <3 
Work is boring , it needs to be over nowww !!! I love you babe <3 
With my baby , happy as can be 
my cat is prolly being put down tomorrow , not happy at all about this 
Be very careful when you make a woman cry , because God counts her tears . The woman came from a man's rib . Not from his feet to be walked on . Not from his head , for him to be superior . But from his side , to be equal . Under the arm to be protected , and next to the heart to be loved . Ladies , pass the word if you agree !!!! And guys , if you're any kind of man , you will believe this also , and will re-post too 
Just to see you smile , I'd do anything , that you wanted me to do . When all is said and done , I'd never count the costs , it's worth all that's lost , just to see you smile . <3 
Helluva day/night ... interesting , random , fun . Now I'm craving brownies

Oh boy , me and < PROPFEMALE > are going to Dance practice tonight , can't wait to see how this ends . 
Moving into my new apartment with my girl ! :) 
I hope everything is fine , I really don't want anything bad to happen to her 
Wonderful start to my day off 
Oh the way life works . :) 
Swimming , chilling , and grilling poolside with < PROPFEMALE > Andrews and waiting for more people to show up . Happy fourth everybody 
movie night at the house , work in the am , then with < PROPFEMALE > for the rest of the day at my sisters grad party

Disappointing for a hurricane , but plenty of pictures to post when the power comes back on 
Truck sold , now to get car 
Off to go pick up the new car 
DMV time .... Need I say more ? 
I appreciate what my dad does for me so much 
Got the invite from AT&T to take the entry exam for an awesome job with them ! 
Working long hours actually hurts 
Why can't they understand\ 
the way we feel\ 
They just don't trust\ 
what they can't explain\ 
I know we're different but , \ 
deep inside us\ 
We're not that different at all \ 
And you'll be in my heart\ 
Yes , you'll be in my heart\ 
From this day on\ 
Now and forever more 
Well , working today from 6am-7pm ..... fun 
13 more hours of work again today , then tomorrow off , then 2 more 13 hour days 
Going to eat dinner with < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > 
I absolutely adore this feeling that I feel when I'm with you , the feeling of complete happiness , the urge to do nothing and be more than content with doing just that . I wouldn't trade being with you for the world ! \ 
I Love you baby with all my heart , I don't know what I would ever do without you .
