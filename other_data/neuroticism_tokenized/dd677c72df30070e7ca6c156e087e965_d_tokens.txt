Is there any difference between \English ( US)\ " and \ " English ( UK)\ " in the language settings ? " 
has fallen in love ... with the \English ( Pirate)\ " language setting ^_^ " 
wishes she was old enough to fall in love and marry Agent Booth and perhaps even consider bearing his children ... 
want a fine headache ? switch your language setting to English ( Upside Down )

Oh why must the cold morning rush through the shuttered windows of those of us whom love the dark of night and its sweet embrace of sleep ? 
Dance monkey ! DANCE ! 
The chill of winter's tide creeps into my home . Now be driven back ! Back I say ! By warmth of furnace glow !
