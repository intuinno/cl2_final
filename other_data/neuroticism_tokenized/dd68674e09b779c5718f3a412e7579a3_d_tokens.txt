1 of every 10 people born is gay . That means 1 of every 10 people is instantly put down , given bad labels , left alone , put in a minority , and so much else ... all for something they didn't ask for . Many gay teens are going to suicide as a way of escaping . If you want to tell them life ... will get better , and you respect them for who they are , copy and pastethis . Most of you won't , but let's see the 5% who will . ?
