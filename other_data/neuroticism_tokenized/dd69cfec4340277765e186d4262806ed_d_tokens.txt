got a taste of self-loathing when she felt domestic glee upon finding the best deal on the grocery items she'd been hunting . so awesome ... so sad ... 
I JUST SAW The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus ! it was beautiful , charming , naughty , dark ! Totally worth seeing on big screen ! if u like movies like Big Fish or the upcoming < PROPFEMALE > and wonderland go see it . so much better than AVATAR ( C.G.I. < PROPFEMALE > Gully ) 
Avatar was ok . sort of a vomit of everything that makes a commercial box office hit . romance , CGI , Sci-Fi , Action , war , good guy wins . yes its touching and yes thought provoking , but no more than any other\humans are the real bad guys\ " story . really to me it was just a expensive < PROPFEMALE > Gully . " 
so pissed i cant go to the hollywood < PROPMALE > show for < PROPFIRST > tonight . fuck work . 
I JUST DANCED IN HAIL ! and then collected it to chill our alcohol

today is gorgeous ! and i have to write and article and work all night ! FML ! in the meantime does anyone want to get chipotle with me ? quick trip . 
the only reason i'm sad to have been here at work all day is that i missed The Who , but that's what the internet is for . 
hey everybody ! Let's all post little non-specific quips on Facebook about the Superbowl . It's not like anyone else is doing it ! We'll be so clever and witty !.... work makes me bitter 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > IS A SEXY BEAST ! 
Today I had to interview the Campus Director of Public Safety for an article . As I waited , I expected a rotund , middle-aged , or at least nearing middle-aged , man with a thick mustache , perhaps a retired police sergeant to appear . Instead , a very very good looking , well groomed 29yrold adonis stood before me . Stunned for only a moment we greeted each other ; but then he smiled & my steamy fantasy ensued 
brain unable to process anymore information . brain needs stimulant . must read . must learn . help brain function . more redbull ? 
should be studying , but instead googled < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > and realized he died in 1995 ! then wondered if his work is more expensive now that he's dead or if his iconic hair was more famous than his impact/work on the < PROPMALE > community . talk amongst yourselves . 
I am the newest editor for the campus paper ! yay !

germans do it better 
I'm discussing with my cousin in germany how americans celebrate st. patricks day whether they're < PROPFEMALE > or not , because we dont have any drinking holidays of our own so we adopt others .

Class doesn't start for 10 more minutes . The professor , a few students , and I are just hanging out , and this one extremely polarizing 19year old is spewing his political rhetoric . he's well versed , but naive , and i have a really great question I'd like to ask him but i am desperately telling myself , \ DO NOT ENGAGE ! \ " No good can be accomplished from that conversation in 10minutes before class . so tempting tho ... " 
i need to practice running in the sand so i dont fuck up my bad knee on the mud run . Anyone want to go on a late night run on the beach tonight ? 
I looked out this morning and the sun was gone Turned on some music to start my day I lost myself in a familiar song I closed my eyes and I slipped away .. Bostin and drag Queens , oh what a night ! Getty tomorrow .

the only thing I know for certain is that you have to strive to collect life's most fantastic moments . That I want to live with my heart and soul open to all possibilities of experiences and last night it led me to befriend a tranny on the dance floor and invite her out for drinks . lol . Another gem in the chronicle of my life . 
so stoked for SHADOW BOXING TONIGHTTTT . 
done with karenina . moving on to the < PROPMALE > palahniuk stack . it's gonna be a long night trapped in my house . 
haha , die ganzen Kinder an < PROPFEMALE > ihrer Schule haben Berichte auf verschiedenen Ländern gemacht . Naturlich hat sie Deutschland gewählt und mit ihrer Vorstellung hat sie winzige Proben Brot und Leberwurst gemacht . Es hat so schlecht geschmeckt weil sie , wie ein Americaner , zu viel Butter angeschmiert hat . Sie waren nicht populär . 
a piece of my faith in humanity was restored the other day , when an 11 yr old girl that I had to ban from my store came in & walked directly up to me and said she was sorry for the way she'd acted . It doesn't matter what awful things she'd said and done , just that she looked sincere . Her parents didn't even know what she did , her apology was on her own accord . I hope she comes in again , i wish i'd given her a hug . 
what if we're all psychopaths just playing the roles we think we're supposed to play ? 
uggh as my mother always used to say , \ aufstehen schule gehen\ " i hate being woken up let alone by a rhyme . lol " 
maybe its because growing up i had brother and overgrown child for a father as playmates , but i have such a pension and enthusiasm for violence ! lol . I loved Kick-Ass ! A-

Alas im required to be such a hermit ... responsibilities call . never have i been so content with24hrs .

I feel naughty because everytime I see a breast examination poster I can't help but think about \Fight Club . \ " Lol . " 
recapturing the idealism that defined my youth and escaping the realism that is my home . A long sweet drive through glorious overcast skies . 
of course as luck would have it , on an already tedious drive home , a stray dog wanders into the path of my car . I avoid hitting it and try and help it away from the main st. and realize i'm in a not great neighborhood and continue driving . naturally a lightening storm follows me home and i run out of gas and have to make an extra stop . yay class at 9am . 
I've got desperate desires and unadmirable plans . My tongue will taste of gin and malicious intent . 
If a cluttered desk is the sign of a cluttered mind , what is the significance of a clean desk ?  
call me nerdy , but I love walking through campus in the spring watching everyone talking and reading in the grass and under the trees . The only thing that would make it even more fantastic would be if I could picnic and read with some pizza and beer while listening to music . That's my heaven ! 
totally just made all 4 of those < PROPMALE > her bitch . Mud Run here I come ! 
No you can't have a grande venti decaf green tea , because it doesn't exist ! And no I can't make you're cappaccino without foam ! gahhhhhh . The day I quit Starbucks I'm pulling a Halfbaked . 
wow , so thats what anxiety feels like 
Ya know the scene in ( 500 ) Days of Summer when he heads off to work and its a perfect day ? Where people are singing , everyones positive , and everything is vibrant . Yeah my day has been like that so far . :) Even all the customers are baristas are happy ! 
Whenever I hear the voice of that woman who reads out love messages on Coast 103.5 , I cringe and change the station . Tonight I stopped and actually listened to 1 letter all the way through and I think I vomited a little . Such boring cliche generic bullshit ! Real love is personal and quirky and dirty or should be ! No wonder so many people have unrealistic expectations . 
its absolutely amazing what 10hrs of sleep and waking up to just the right song can do for your mood ! :) 
dude ! I'm watching Nat . Geo . and I had to change the channel when the camera cuts to a hippopotamus and the show host yells , \Whoa ! That is one forceful defecation ! \ " vomit . Of course I changed the channel back as soon as I thought it was over . lol . " 
wants to go to the < PROPFEMALE > Wars burlesque show in honor of < PROPFEMALE > Wars Appreciation Day . Is it still only on Saturdays or will there be a special show for today ? 
Some guy overdosed on heroin in the bathroom at my work last night . They took him away in an ambulance , no one knows if he made it or not . Night shifts at Starbucks , never a dull moment . 
dancing with mary-jane and watching < PROPFIRST > hawking's universe ; soothing yet stimulating . 
It's absolutely incredible how < PROPFIRST > Hawking's robot voice kills any attempt at a joke in his interviews . Is that insensitive ? Cause I couldn't help but think it . I hope hell has a beach . 
so who at the party last night kept thinking of < PROPFIRST > DiCaprio in the \Departed\ " whenever Boston guy spoke ? lol . It was so stereotypical I couldn't believe it was real ! " 
got free tickets to review the GWC spring musical . The highlight of the performance was that one of the girls labia , yes LABIA , was accidently hanging out of her costume , but somehow I think that'd be an inappropriate lead to my review . I could not stop staring . Like a train wreck I had to look twice to make sure my eyes didn't deceive me . 
accidently missed class when she got caught up in conversation at dinner with her co-editors . Seems like luck because now her stomach is imploding and a 3hour lecture may have been the death of her . 
I found myself watching Mad < PROPMALE > Road Warrior for a little bit today for the first time in years . I have to say that I don't remember all the thugs looking so overtly homosexual . lol . 
I've decided I too am going to Peru to visit Machu Pichu and get buzzed eating coca leaves with the locals . lol . I love < PROPFIRST > Bourdain . 
grass isn't greener on the other side . it's greener where you water it - who knew my bestie was so smart !

loves disappearing in a town where no one knows her name . hiking , coffee , reading , people watching . 
I can be hangin out here at the coffee shop , I can be drinking margaritas , and can be relaxing at the botanical gardens , but as long as I have a pad and pen I can say I'm working and actually be getting stuff done . This is the shit . I feel so goood . No unwanted distractions from random people I used to work with or went to highschool with ... no offense , I still love most of you ;) 
< PROPFEMALE > and I are eating in the car outside stater bros watching as a group of guys tailgate around a car and freestyle rap . random and awesome .

is not sure how to properly format her broadcast script and wishes she could just sleep . 
SAVE AND PRINT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I get to sleep for 1 hour ! Except , now I don't think that is going to be possible because I've been double fisting redbull and coffee ... 
2 down 2 to go . This utter exhaustion will pay off shortly . Disneyland Tuesday and mini vacation begins Thursday . 
Found three new freckles on her face ... wtf 
Beer and wine festival , drinking at disneyland . In line for < PROPFEMALE > Tour arguing withGreg about Lost . LOL . 
People really don't appreciate effort anymore . Unless they have a physical gift in their hands gratitude is fleeting 
Is annoyed and does not appreciate when religious zealots purposefully attempt to anytagonize her into a debate while at work 
If only logic were as contagious as stupidity 
< PROPFIRST>'s just pointed out that my battered rescued cat with one eye looks exactly like the cat captain Ahab would have if he had had a cat . 
They say it's never too late to say you care , to do the things you've always wanted to try , to let yourself love , and to taste and share with others every aspect of life . This is not true . You never know when your last day will be . With love to my cousin < PROPFIRST > , who passed away last night unexpectedly in his sleep . He was only 26 . 
without the constraints of reality creativity is much too easy . 
is very disappointed she missed the hockey game with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > , but had a blast drinking her gin&juice , playing mini-golf , and getting tan ! Alas , now I must pay the dear price , for the heat has stricken me ill ! If only I could be in two places at once , if only I had hydrated better . Next week we're hitting the batting cages , minus the alcohol , because that's just dangerous . 
Just found out there such thing as a sneezing fetish . Hot .

Bliss ! I have only just now awoken from deep sweet slumber . Amazingly numb and relaxed ; ravaged by sleep . I haven't [ slept ] like that since grade school . Mmmm 
Drinking at the museum walking through the hall of gems and mirrors in 3D glasses on our way to the dance floor ! Then off to the whale exhibit ! People are wearing masquerade attire ! so insanely sexy ! 
wishes people could put aside they're trivial , petty quirks to be the person that someone needs . Connect on a deeper level instead of just worrying about all the meaningless crap 
The library should name a wing after me . My overdue fees could fund their entire overhead . lol . Sushi and work at 4pm tasty tasty . DVRing the game cause I can't make it to < PROPMALE>'s tonight . 
Cheers ! \

it's good to have people who similarly share the love of silence , a fondness for the unknown , a taste for the drink , and good conversation . ? 
I'm standing in a cramped line in front of the court house directly behind a man with serious < PROPMALE > whose dandruff is so bad I'm afraid to breathe too deeply for fear of inhalation . Could my day start any worse ?? 
The people alone at traffic court today were enough to make me a law abiding citizen . Never again do I want to be trapped in a room with those people . I'm not exaggerating at all when I say that the man sitting in front of me had a flea jumping around on his neck and the 450lb woman in the front was wearing short shorts and no bra ! Wobbling nips the size of planetesimals ! Vomit ! < PROPMALE > galore . 
Is checking to see if Netflix carries \McGyver\ " for streaming . "

Independence Day is nice because everyone is outside riding bicycles , people arefriendly , everyones got a buzz , and I just saw some guy in full CaptianAmerica garb riding a beach cruiser saluting traffic . On the other hand everyone is spewing retarded nonsensical \patrioitic\ " bullshit and I swear someone just tried to tell me today was about freeing slaves another said \ " it should be about Jesus . \ " wtf ?

loves it when \customers\ " go into the bathroom sober and come back out tweaked . She loves it even more when she has to clean up after them . " 
It feels as though no amount of sleep could ever restore vitality to this body . This last week has been exhausting . 
was just almost mugged . Some guy followed me while I walked alone to the back alley parking lot behind the post office . One hand inm his pocket I ran to my car and he signaled me to roll my window down , and mouthed he just wanyted to know the time . This bitch ain't dumb I stepped on the gas ! 
Getting together at old world village at 1130am for Germany vs . Spain , the semi-finals ! Call me if you're down . 
Made friends with the sweetest old babyboomer at OldWorld today , he told me stories about his < PROPMALE > father and Italian mother meeting during the war . We chit-chatted over beer and soccer . Good times . 
has more books in her bed than space to sleep , yet is too exhausted to deal with relocating them and would never dream of pushing them off the side . Entangled in a twist of sheets and paperbacks , as if I were twelve again , hiding my books with me in the covers as I pretend to sleep . 
It's been too long since I have observed people as if they were human beings .

Zicke zacke , zicke zacke , hoi ! hoi ! hoi ! 
A nice quiet night to catch up on media and me time . I feel like my brain has been wired all wrong the last few months and I am regretting decisions that I made when not acting myself . Maybe I needed to act out to teach myself something . C'est la vie ! Filling out Americorps applications .

Integrity is everything .
