Dear everyone , I lost my phone so if you call or text and I never respond , it's not because I don't love you . ^^ ; 
You know that tingly feeling you get when you read about a true story of a person who encounters ghosts/spirits/angels ? Maybe it's just me , but basically the point of this status is to recommend the book The Valkyries by Paulo Coelho . It's based on a true story . It wasn't as inspirational as The Alchemist , but hey , it's based on a true story and it's about meeting angels !!!! :D
