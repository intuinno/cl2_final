I just joined Facebook . Win . 

Who's going to Alamo < PROPFIRST>'s ? 
Everybody be sure to print out permission slips for the ASU Food Drive Celebration this Friday ! We need more people , and the deadline is now Thursday ! 
NCIS episode tonight 
I was practically the only person wearing shorts at school today . 
24 
My flash drive broke earlier this morning . :( 
is listening to awesome < PROPFIRST > music . http://themushroomkingdom.net/sounds.shtml 
In the News : It was recently announced that windmills designed to harness alternate energy to avoid global warming ... froze . LOL 
Back to The World that Trade Created ... meh . 
A Muslim and a Mormon walk into a bar . They turn to each other , and say , \What were we thinking ? \ " Then they leave . " 
< PROPFIRST > and I are selling Domino's Pizza cards tomorrow at school ! They cost $10 each . It's a buy 1 large pizza from Domino's , get another one free , 20 times . That's 20 more LARGE pizzas , for just $10 . Limited supply of 15 . Buy them . Eat Domino's Pizza . 
< PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > ! Rand < PROPFIRST > ! 
Chain grabbing is such a cheap tactic in Brawl ... 
World that Trade Created deprives me of my sleep ... 
Well , movie night was great . We watched < PROPMALE > and Gromit , and Forbidden Planet . But why were there only about six sophomores there ? Seriously ? Guys , we're so underrepresented . 
Ugh , every attempt I make to upload photos fails . 
First place in DI ! Oh yeah ! Share your glee . 
Now to watch more Yu-Gi-Oh : The Abridged Series . 
Going to work out at the Y ! 
I just went an entire day without anybody commenting on my awesome fish shirt . That's a first . :( 
Sore throat ... fun ... 
Life seems to get more and more confusing each day . 
Random nosebleed ... also fun . 
Happy Brawl Day . 
I just had a dream ... in which I got a random nosebleed . What the heck ? 
I have a cool mask now thanks to < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > . 
Just watched NCIS ... wohoo ! Why is there only an option to poke people ? Why can't you slap them upside the back of the head instead ? 
Leaving for New Mexico to ski at Angel Fire ! Yay ! 
Done skiing . Now my face is in total pain from sunburns . Fun . 
I have just learned that in an < PROPMALE > vs . Falco match , < PROPMALE > stands no < PROPMALE > whatsoever . 
Did anybody notice that I was gone today ? 
Happy < PROPFEMALE > unbirthday to everybody . Except < PROPFIRST > . 
Before I accept his friend request , who is < PROPFIRST > Staggs ? I have no clue who he is , except based on his picture , he's in College Park .

Amazingly enough , nobody has asked me for any math/CS help tonight . 
How cool would an Academy Super Smash Bros . Brawl tournament sound ? 
Done with English Journal . But Mrs. Downey was right . I can't do TPCASTTs to save my life . 
So , what's the theme for tomorrow : baseball or Quiddich ? 
Anybody doing anything tonight ? 
Falcon ... PUNCH !!! 
I can't motivate myself to write an essay for English . 
HeartGold ... SoulSilver ... pwn . 
In Soviet Russia , the game loses you ! 
Fitness Gram tomorrow ( I think ? ) I intend to jog with Firepower the Quilava 
I just learned that my Quilava wrestled < PROPFEMALE > Rippetoe's Lugia ... and won . How strange is that ? 
http://www.formspring.me/mongeese 
I lost the game . 
I'm considering dropping out of the Academy and going to The Woodlands . 
I've decided something : Quilava is cooler than Typhlosion . 
Walking around in a Rocket uniform on HeartGold - epic win . Your rival forcing you back into your ordinary uniform - epic fail . 
With both a program due and a Pre-Cal test tomorrow , I wonder how many chat messages I'm going to get saying \Can you help me with ____ ? \"" 
Anyone know the molal boiling point elevation/freezing point depression constant of ethanol ? 
After waking up at six in the morning , I'm now at < PROPFEMALE > , where it's raining , waiting for my tennis match to be reschedueled to quite possibly sometime tomorrow . MLIA 
76 pages down , about 200-something to go . Fun . 
' ?? \\????\\?= (•??)= ? / ???? /' ? ' ? ? 
Leaving for DI tomorrow ... w00t . 
Headache ... can't concentrate on homework , even though I have a worksheet , a dialectical journal , and an entire Spanish project due tomorrow . 
Anybody in Mrs. Downey's class know the instructions for the dialectical journal thing ? I can't find mine . 
Hooray , I got my phone and Poké < PROPMALE > back ! 
I have so much college spam , it's ridiculous . 
Good luck to the BEST team ! 
Nobody's responsed to my note . At all . :( 
My new profile pic is PURE WIN . 
I feel so left out sometimes . 
Anyone know who we're supposed to address a letter of application to ? Dr. Caffery ? And what exactly counts as \Experience\ " ? Volunteering for VBS ? Being an officer in a club ? I'm confused . " 
Anybody know what \skills\ " and \ " experience\ " would classify as relevant for being a Fish Camp Counselor ? " 
I never , ever , ever make absolute statements . 
Relevant experience as an effective team member : completed Super Smash Bros . Brawl and New Super < PROPFIRST > Bros . Wii COOPERATIVELY . This would be hilarious to add to my resume . 
Friday is going to be my least happy day of this week . 
< PROPFIRST > seems to be dead right now . 
Yu-Gi-Oh ! The Abridged Movie is hilarious . 
I feel so invisible sometimes . 
Tennis is so tiring sometimes . 4 ZAT points FTW ! 
Okay , I'm very sorry if Facebook decided to give you a wall post about an Optical Illusions video . I clicked something that I ought not have . My bad . Sadly , I can't remove them , because Facebook won't tell me who it hit . 
NCIS is the best TV show ever . 
Say , did anbody take notes over MIGRATION ? 
Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo . 
I just learned how to pull up PNG files in Java Graphics ... So cool ... 
Just finished the Microeconomics/World History study party ! 
Pokemon + Java = Epicness 
Stalin Appreciation Day as an unofficial Facebook event is almost as bad as the fact that < PROPMALE>'s Birthday is an official holiday in seven states . 
bah , I hate Facebook spam . Sorry about that , to anybody that got hit . 
< PROPFIRST > Buffett concert in a few hours ! Whoo ! 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MKQKmWVhns 
This is surprising . Not one person has asked me to help them with their CS project via Facebook . 
Okay , if anybody is wondering how to incorporate their Graphics class ( referred to as Graphics ) into their Driver program ( referred to as Driver ) , just add the following line to the main method of the Driver :\ 
\ 
Graphics . main(args ); \ 
If there's any problem , just ask . 
And so , with no more Java programs to help people with , my brief popularity spurt dies . 
Super < PROPFIRST > Galaxy 2 !!! 
Time to study for Chemistry ... to Wikipedia ! 
And with a party like tonight's , the rest of the summer will seem so bland in comparison . \ 
Except Fish Camp . 
This might be a problem . If I just pause and listen , I heara somewhat softer version of the background theme of the Green Power Stars from Super < PROPFIRST > Galaxy 2 . 
Falcon ... 
Well , the NCIS season finale just blew my mind . 
Legend of Zelda : Skyward Sword looks so cool ! 
Curse you , Barack Obama , for giving your \Special Report\ " during NCIS ! " 
According to Facebook , many who like NCIS also like country music . Interesting . 
just completely revamped his forehand ... for perhaps the 10th time . 
Facebook recommends that I like Barack Obama . \ 
Facebook obviously doesn't know me very well . 
\Internet Explorer has stopped working . Would you like to restart Internet Explorer ? \ " \ 
I got my driver's liscense ! Happiness ! 
Fun fact : Pikachu , when translated using Japanese onomatopoeia , becomes \Sparklesqueak . \"" 
Oligopoly is pretty much the most awesome board game ever . 
I , Professor Plum , killed Mr. < PROPFIRST > in the Lounge with the Wrench . 
\12 Angry Men\ " is one of the greatest classics of all time . " 
I just finished programming a clock . 
I finally no longer have to wear my retainer in the day ! Yes ! 
I have 1337 unread messages . 
POKE me if you've ever had a crush on me ; LIKE this status if you think im a good friend ; INBOX me ( what is this ??? ) if you ever wanted a relationship with me COMMENT this status if we had good memories together . now let's see who's brave enough to copy & paste this as their status . ? summer chain statuses . :) ( copied from < PROPFIRST > , continuing chain ) 
Toy Story 3 is amazing . 
And just in time , my somewhat misplaced Fish Camp Counselor papers are found . 
Anyone know the schedule for Fish Camp counselors next Wednesday ? Was it ever even established ? 
Did anybody else experience a blackout ? We lost power for about an hour or so . 
Everyone , I need ideas on what to give as gifts to my fish during Fish Camp . \ 
I also need the schedule for Wednesday . \ 
Any help would be appreciated . 
Suicidalism - the belief that a person can run an infinite number of suicides , then still have enough energy for tennis . 
Well , better it thunder today than Thursday . 
Stop signs should declare their presence strongly , not hide behind a tree . 
Okay , anybody who thinks that the Incredible Pizza event is being rescheduled , it is NOT being rescheduled ! So please show up ! 
Incredible Pizza was incredible . Great night . 
Almost ready for Fish Camp ! 
< PROPFIRST > keeps creeping over my shoulder ... weird . 
Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody\ 
I've got some money ' cause I just got paid\ 
Now , how I wish I had someone to talk to\ 
I'm in an awful way 
On my profile , I'm allowed to edit the day and month that I was born in , but not the year . How odd . 
The government shut down a kid's lemonade stand in Oregon because the kid didn't have a restaurant permit . Oh , snap . 
We didn't start the fire\ 
It's been always burning\ 
Since the world was turning\ 
But we did ignite it\ 
When we tried to fight it 
Are there any Facebook applications that cause you to send chat messages to random people advertising various things ? 
Spot 368 , as long as < PROPFIRST > Peirce gets his driver's lisence tomorrow . 
And so , XM Radio , and with it Radio Margaritaville , are no longer avaliable . Shame .

If there's one thing Mrs. Smith will appreciate about my essays , it's that they aren't too long . 
Finally done with the essays ! Hallelujah ! 
There was a horse race with two horses in the lead named \The Wife Knows Everything\ " and \ " The Wife Doesn't Know . \ " \ 
I have accomplished the ultimate programming reference . 
Have you ever saw the picture of the fat man who looked for his dog while his dog was at his feet and still did not have the wit to see what was the matter-have you observed the cat ? 
Tic Tac Toe has never before reached such levels of epic win . 
Today was probably meant to be clarifying day . \ 
I'm actually more confused than I used to be . 
Today , I learned that my presence and achievements in Computer Science almost completely overshadowed everything else I did last year , making them completely negligible . \ 
Paraphrased . 
Scooby Doo has apparently changed a lot since I've last watched it . 
Anyone doing DI , what does \parent supervisor\ " mean ? " 
Academy kids , remember that Donut Day is tomorrow at about 6:30 in the morning , so show up , or else I will contact < PROPFIRST > Brehm . 
Well , a lot of unexpected things occured for a day in which I thought I'd do little but watch online episodes of Yu-Gi-Oh . 
Anyone know how to do #7 ( sewage bacteria ) for the WebAssign ? 
I hate Facebook glitches . 
I've decided that I hate typing résumés . 
I realized something recently : two of my teachers have ever told me that if I can survive them , I can survive anything . The strange thing is , both of them are named Smith . 
That's it , we're going to Globals this year . 
I think the internship at BioTX is going to be amazing . 
Homecoming was great ! But now I don't know how long it will be until I see < PROPFEMALE > Neugebauer again ! 
How's it possible for somebody to post something if they haven't been online for over an hour ? 
Who doesn't just love writing the exact same thing twice just to show that absolutely nothing happened in a chemical reaction ? 
Why does it seem that I'm so easily forgotten recently ? 
All these < PROPFEMALE > s that just want to verify that I'm human ... yeah , right . They lie through their bytes . No < PROPFEMALE > would mind having it's fan population artificially increased by robotic accounts . \ 
People , if a < PROPFEMALE > asks for you to verify that you are human , it's just trying to trick you . 
Anybody know how to record the output of a television as a file readable by a computer ? 
I finally completed my video for Physics . Cracker launchers FTW . 
Things are becoming more picture-oriented ... this is getting ridiculous . 
Hey , Vibhav Ganesh , guess who had to play in a tennis tournament with no preparation because another person completely forgot about it ? 
\Today is 10/10/10 
Like my status and I'll tell you : 1 . Something I've learned about you from looking at your wall for 13 seconds . 2 . The color you remind me of . 3 . My first memory of you . 4 . The animal you remind me of . 5 . Ask something I've always wondered about you . 6 . My favorite thing about you . 7 . Give you a weird nickname . 8 . Challenge you to repost . \ 
Copied from < PROPFIRST > . 
Looking over today's news feeds ... \ 
it looks like I'll be the third to post that I recently got a haircut . Strange coincidence . 
Anyone know how to solve for energy based on temperature and molar mass ? 
Can anybody send me the problems for Chapter 3 and Chapter 6 of the AP CS book ? I still don't have one . 
Okay , I just HATE those Facebook < PROPFEMALE > s that don't tell you that they've hidden an invisible button on their < PROPFEMALE > that makes you automatically like their < PROPFEMALE > s and even more < PROPFEMALE > s . Especially when its on the ' Play ' button of a video . And it then claims that I've already watched the video . Even though it still doesn't load after I like it . MEH . 
Two people in a row have just used the phrase \X can't come [ soon ] enough\ " within ten minutes of each other . Very strange coincidence . " 
Just got \Kirby's Epic Yarn . \ " \ 
\The presentation was very disappointing . I didn't see any invisible children . \ " - < PROPFIRST > Morriss " 
Happy halloween , everybody ! 
Anyone know exactly who a check to the food drive should be written out to ? 
496 cans total in one night ! Woot ! 
Gah ! Why must Java hate Rectangles with negative heights and widths ? 
I've had so much on my mind recently . By analogy , if you've ever played the Super < PROPFIRST > 64 level Tick-Tock Clock , and you activated the event where every piece of machinery goes haywire and behaves completely unpredictably ... yeah , that's what my mind's been . 
Please put this on your status if you know someone who has been harassed , tortured , or killed by Death Eaters . Death Eaters are nearly unstoppable , and , in case you didn't know , they have taken over the Ministry of Magic . 93% of people won't copy and paste this , because of ... fear of being killed . The other 7% of people are a part of Dumbledore's Army and are fighting against the Death Eaters . 
Well , I just ate a most delicious cupcake . Thank you , < PROPFEMALE > Torres ! 
Well , I just completed every Java problem that CodingBat can throw at me . \ 
Joy . 
Does anyone know the units used in the Heisenberg uncertainty principle ? 
All this talk about Pokémon profile pic month , maybe I should change my picture , too , maybe to ... oh , wait . 
< PROPFIRST > Menees and < PROPMALE > McDonald , you two must battle it out for the title of ultimate Bulbasaur . 
Well , I guess it's about tme I get a new profile pic . 
Ugh , I just realized that I forgot to turn in the Main Event permission slip and check ... xO 
Guys , for the WebAssign , what format do we use to add d orbitals to our hybridizaitons ? Would it be dsp ? spd ? What ? 
To all those who wish to draw images onto their Java Graphics , here is a helpful website that for some reason cannot be opened at school :\ 
http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c12/s1.html 
Well , Main Event was great , especially the Dance Dance Revolution and the air hockey . 
I am now the pround owner of what might be the world's most unreliable nerf gun . 
Regrettably , I cannot find my Nunchuck right now . 
Today , I just heard of the name < PROPFIRST > de Tocqueville , yet I've already seen him quoted three times in three completely different sources . Odd . 
As I prepare myself for the English midterm , my mind drifts back to a lovely fire that took place at the beginning of the winter break . 
\Today is 1/11/11 
Just got my driver's licence again . It only took about an hour , a relatively short time . 
This is uncanny . I only ever see people post on Facebook that they got a haircut on the same day that I got a haircut . 
In an interview on January 6 , 2010 , Nintendo president Satoru Iwata stated , \You are now less than 365 days away from a new console < PROPFEMALE > game . \ " \ 
My valuable advice : if you are driving in the dark , always make sure that you know where you are going , and check to see if your turn is supposed to be at a traffic light or not , because one wrong turn lends itself to another , and before you know it , you're on the wrong side of the freeway with no clue how to get back . 
\Is this you ? Is this you ? \ " \ 
e to the pi i ! We will win DI ! 
Quote of the week goes to < PROPFIRST > Brehm ( panicked ): \Where's my dress ? Where's my dress ! \"" 
The Legend of < PROPFEMALE > series is now 25 years old ! 
was ambushed by < PROPFIRST > Bowen and < PROPFEMALE > Torres , and managed to survive . 
So for the English outline , are we required to have hard copies of our sources ? \ 
And what's with this physics project I'm hearing about ? 
Does anyone know what a CQ Researcher Pro/Con excerpt should be cited as ? 
Mrs. Smith said we'd get hardly any homework in her class . Most of my day today has been English homework . 
Nitwit ! Blubber ! Oddment ! Tweak ! 
Well , with the SAT on Saturday , does anybody have any tes t-t aking tips ? 
Quote of the day :\ 
< PROPFIRST > Brehm : \It feels like being caressed by angels ... \ " \ 
Well , that was three dollars well spent . Why hasn't anybody posted any Pi Day photos yet ? 
I have something to share with the world : I hate SAT essays . 
Got Pokémon Black and White ! 
Anybody else having trouble finding parts 2 , 3 , and 4 for the English journal ? 
Ugh , apple pie . Anybody have a YouTube video for pi day ? 
Chem paper ? Check . Reserach paper ? Check . My life is my own again . 
And Mrs. Smith has been fooled ! 
Good luck to all of our DI teams at Lubbock !
