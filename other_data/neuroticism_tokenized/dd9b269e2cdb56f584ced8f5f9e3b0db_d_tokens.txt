Still has lots of laundry to do .. :( 

T O U C H D O W N !! LET'S GO FALCONS ! What a way to start off work .. Now hopefully I won't be late from watching the game .. ;) 
Finally !, a schedule change that i like ! :) 
Smh , what is the world coming to when father's are pickin up dates for their son at the grocery store ! 
God bless the first Chilean miner that made it out too safety , and also bless those miners and their families who have yet to be rescued . 
Gotta be up for work in five hours but there's too much good news going on for me to sleep , don't wanna miss anything while i'm down and out , lol !! :] 
Managed to get up in time for work even though i just fell asleep a few hours ago , lol . :) 
Many blessings and well wishes to @ < PROPFIRST > TwistedMind Nash and @ < PROPFEMALE > Bivins !! Congratulations ! :D 
Ugh , i was anxious to get off before .. Now i REALLY wanna be off . 6hrs and countin , lol . :/ 
I will not be able to go to sleep until the last person in that mine is safely back on land ; miners and rescuers included !! 
WooHoo !! One more miner to go !! :D [ plus rescuers ] 
And they're all out !! Now time to get those rescue workers !! 
Last rescue worker has made it into the capsule all by himself , but with millions of people still watching he is not alone ! 
All are well now .. :D 
Just woke up with a huge ass headache and gotta be to work in 4hrs ... this is NOT a good sign . :[ 
Although I don't always like changes , some new experiences are good . :] 
Will someone PLEASE put this dog outta misery ?? He's been barkin since 1AM and i'm still up listenin to him ... :/ 
Feelin Chicken < PROPMALE > tonight .. 
Scratch that .. make it Little Caesars :D 
The past is the past and there is nothing that can change that , but it is disappointing at times to realize later on that what you believed to had been true , never really was ... 
you know that i would , if only i could .. 
My mom has made me laugh , wiped my tears hugged me tight , watched me succeed , saw me fall , cheered me on , kept me going strong & drove me crazy at times . Moms are a promise from God that you will have a friend forever ! Put this on your status if you love your mom ! 
Still can't believe I went through with it , but it was most definitely for a good cause . 
West GA bound to see CourtSport Rush and < PROPFIRST > Crochran ! :D

Only you could make a good moment go bad 
But HE can make it better ! 
Gone to vote ..

Is it so hard to just be real , at least with yourself if no one else ..?

So proud of my niece Jayla Cox for making it into the Beta Club !! :] 
Woke up at 6:40 for this work meeting and can't go back to sleep now .. Oh well , time to find me some hot cocoa .

34mins and 33secs still no closer to understanding the mind of Kanye West .. FYI : Runaway is an interesting video .. and Selita Ebanks is BEAUTIFUL ! 
At the doctor's , someone come get me please !! :( 
YUM , YUM , YUM !! :D 
What do you do when you realize that in you lies the ability , knowledge , and will to expose the lies of many , ruin others reality , and bring truths to light ?? Most people don't understand that just because something hasn't be said about the wrongs done doesn't necessarily mean it never will be .. And another thing , never underestimate the power of a WOMAN on a mission who has nothing left to lose .. 
Well now that that's over with ... 
am i really the only one still up at this time ?? :/ 
Even though I never got to meet you , I will always love you .. < PROPFEMALE > Baldwin < PROPMALE > January 31 , 1931 - November 11 , 1988 . 
Uhm , not hatin or nothin but who in the world keep comin up with all these Facebook status games ?? 
LMAO !! I found this in a \fortune cookie\ " .. \ " Time heals all wounds but Excedrin speeds the process .. \ " very true . " 
And now you got someone who don't treat you right , \ 
You already know who use to treat you right , \ 
You look for me and you know I be out of sight , \ 
When you the one who told me to get out ya life , \ 
That's unfortunate that you didn't believe in me ... \ 
Unfortunate - < PROPMALE > Songz

It's interesting how when you are at a low point in life those who you thought were close are no where to be found , but as soon as you begin to make changes for the better they come out the woodwork to try to get you back off track . This time around I have the strength to resist temptations and the wisdom to see those for who they truly are . Failure is no longer an option and I refuse to settle for less . 
lmao , gone for only two days and end up with 20 posts from farmville .. x )
