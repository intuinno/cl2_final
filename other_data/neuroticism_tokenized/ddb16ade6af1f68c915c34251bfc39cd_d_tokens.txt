Husker Prediction vs . Texas- ( 12/06 ) B12 Championship -W- 34-21 : Pelini sneaks into Bevo's stable and cuts out < PROPMALE > organs , feeding them to his defensive players . PETA bans Pelini from the state of Texas . 
If Suh doesn't win the Heisman trophy , then the Heisman trophy isn't an award worth winning anymore .

With that second field goal , Nebraska now has the number 1 scoring defense in all of the nation ! Blackshirt Power !!! 
Today was an epic win . 
I love how < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > spend over two hours becoming friends with the Russian mafia and ten kill them off in less than a minute , but man can < PROPFIRST > throw a knife !

If the referees would have called the clothesline Zoubek put on < PROPMALE > with about 30 seconds left , there would be a lot of people in blue devil blue crying right now . 
The Mets Cardinals game refuses to end ... now we go into the 20th inning . 
is dangerously understressed for this time of year . 
We need to move soccer to 6:30 , St. < PROPFIRST>'s has Saturday mass from 5:30 - 6:30 so if we start at six we could be loud and disruptive and possibly kicked off . 
We need to play soccer on weekdays too . I propose Tuesday at Maxey , they have those small metal goals we can easily move and a smoother field .

Stadium is a great place , nothing like it . < PROPMALE > stole the show , too bad Martinez didn't just throw the ball away more . Tons of Husker fans in the OU section . I don't have my voice any more . That is about it . 
Too cold back in Nebraska .
