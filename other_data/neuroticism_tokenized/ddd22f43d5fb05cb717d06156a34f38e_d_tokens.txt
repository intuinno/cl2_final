2 weeks of CAPT ... :/ 
I really need lids ! . . . on Cafe World that is :D 
Many things once loved are coming to a drastic hault . Don't bother to ask ' what's wrong ' because no one truly cares . 
just realized how fast summer is coming and how much fun it will be but how much she will miss the seniors once this year is over . 
Mrs. J , thank you for putting a smile on everyone's faces every Friday . You inspired me to be more open with others and to pass the happiness along with merely a smile in the halls . May you rest in peace and thank you for just being yourself . 
is starting to hate finals ... a lot !!! 
can't imagine waking up next year and not talking to all of the wonderful seniors . It'll be really hard saying goodbye :( 
one down , five more to go :/ 
Summer ! 
I don't care for your fairytales . Your so worried about the maiden though you know she's waiting for the next best thing . 
Profile pictures make me self-concious :( 
< PROPMALE > Farm continues to inspire me to act with my body , not just my words ! 
Missing < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > , Iu-Wei , < PROPFEMALE > and so many other people ! 
Needs a new profile picture ... 
Summer , you escape from my grasp so fast . Please answer me : why couldn't you last ? 
Join < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE>'s Bollywood Dance Class at < PROPFEMALE>'s Dance Center ! 
is spending most of the day with APUSH ... again . 
thinks that the first APUSH test should only be on one chapter . I'm starting to confuse colonies -_- Roanoke , Jamestown , Carolinas , < PROPFEMALE > , Connecticut , New York , Rhode Island , Massachusetts and on and on ... Anyone know if the test is hard ? 
knows that hard work and determination will conquer all . 
had a very interesting first day of < PROPMALE > year 
is thankful for the long weekend ! 
is completely and thoroughly exhausted ... 
really wants to know why teachers assign the largest tests the week after the Berlin Fair . Can't we just enjoy one weekend of freedom ... fries that is ! :D 
is enjoying the movement of light and dark on the curtains from the trees swaying in the breeze . The simplest things are always the best :D 
Put this on your status if you know or love someone who is gay . Being gay is not a\ 
disease nor a choice . People who are gay are not looking for a cure but\ 
ACCEPTANCE and EQUAL RIGHTS ... 93% won't copy and paste this . Will you\ 
make it your status ...... for at least one hour ? Promote ... LOVE\ 
... & ... Acceptance ! NOT hate ! 
finally found the best birthday present she could for Akanksha Singh ! Hope you like it sweet potatah fri :D 
wishes she could sing as good as Najoua Belyzel ! 
Morning , Sunshine ! 
The best things in life are those that are simple , sweet , and can be cherished forever . No kids , I'm not talking about chocolate bars . I'm talking about cardboard boxes , stickers , and hugs :D 
Me encantan mis amigos ! <3 No necesito McDonald's . Las hamburguesas son repugnante ;P 
is absolutely in love with Tangled ! Who knew that the girl who hates all things Disney could contradict herself ... Rapunzel <3 < PROPFIRST > Forever 
Sprite :P 
has been living on coffee and sugar with sixish hours of sleep for the past week ... still wondering when the crash is going to zzzz 
My plate of \Welcome Back to School\ " came with a generous portion of \ " Time to Study ! \ " and a cold helping of \ " Remember : The Midterms are Coming . The Midterms are Coming . \ " Where's < PROPFIRST > Revere and a decent school lunch when you need them ? " 
I want to be the first person to wish you good morning ... every morning ! So here it is , \Buenos dias mis amigos . \"" 
Delays and no school are amazing ... except when you have to study for a midterm or final !!! 
Is officially a teacher and gets to work with Akanksha Singh !! Oooohhhh Yeaaaahh ! 
It's Over !!! :D 
\Step to the rhythm and dance to the music ! All in together we shine ! \ " \ 
Wants to remind everyone that they are important , no matter what anybody else says ! Bullying is still an issue in our school system . Just a reminder : just because a person looks happy , does not mean that they are strong enough to handle the weight of the world on their shoulders . Today and everyday , make sure to show everyone how much you care . You could influence a life . Post this on your wall if you agree 
Pretty pretty please , don't you ever ever feel like your less than , less than perfect . Pretty pretty please , if you ever ever feel like your nothing . You are perfect to me ! 
Everyone should come to the Poetry Out Loud Competition tonight at 7 !! 
1 more week until vacation !!! 
Just saw BHS on the news again . I'm getting sick of our town not thinking about the kids . Sure it's a lot of money but we fear for our lives every day . Who knows when the roof will fall ?! I don't want to see anyone get hurt or even worse . 
All of us have a thousand wishes . To be thinner , have more money , a new phone . A cancer patient only has one , to kick cancer's ass . In honor of someone who is FIGHTING cancer , repost this .
