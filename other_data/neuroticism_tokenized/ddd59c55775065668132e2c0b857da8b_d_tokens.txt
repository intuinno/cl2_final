A person who is loving and caring . Loyal to everyone important in her life and is easy to forgive , but won't let someone walk all over her . She steals the heart of everyone she dates , because she is real . Very few girls often like this person , because they feel threatened or intimidated by her . She is also someone who people seem to obsess about without ever realizing it . 
Parks and Recreation just might be my new favorite show :) 
Someone needs to tell these girls the truth . I've about had my fill . 
Is it just me , or does this new layout seem a little like ... myspace ?
