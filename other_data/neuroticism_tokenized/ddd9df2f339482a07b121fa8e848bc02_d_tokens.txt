ugh , my horoscope : You could get into it with a friend today if you discover that he or she is keeping something hidden from you . But you may turn a relatively unimportant oversight or a misunderstanding into a crisis because of your more general fear about being left out . Don't expect others to always include you if you are the one who is often quick to act so independently .
