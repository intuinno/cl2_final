I wonder sometimes what did I ever do to recieve the blessing of finding my one true love . Whatever it was it must of been grand because my world is now a paradise . 
Every moment I spend with < PROPFEMALE > Youngberg , that is when I know I am right where I belong . Then a flow of warmth eminates from my heart and I know that there is no place I would rather be .

I am trying to figure out the main story line to the new book I am writing . It has such incredibly high expectations and I know this will be one of the best and the very best I'll ever make . I know it'll be the best book series I'll ever write and everyone will fall in love with it when it becomes an anime movie . I bet everyone wonders what it is about(if you do just ask . ) 
I have the greatest mom ! <3 I'm just saying :D 
I have finally found the names of two books I am writing :D 
Youth Conference was EXTRAORDINARY ! 
All I can think of is < PROPFIRST > and what she's doing now . I hope she is happy because I am as my love her fills my heart . < PROPFIRST > is more than I could ever expected to find in life . I found true love in her heart . 
When I was with < PROPFIRST > , my heart had returned home to where it truly belonged and still does . It does not where she is , but as long as I am with her , I am home 
When I was with < PROPFIRST > , \ 
my heart had returned home to where it truly belonged and still does . It\ 
does not where she is , but as long as I am with her , I am home 
If any man could stand in my place , they would be able to feel just how lucky I am and know that I am possibly the luckiest man alive to this very day and farther than that . 
I wish I could be with < PROPFIRST > in this moment . To just sit with her without a single word is like a moment in heaven . 
So much warmth fills my heart as I read and remember the words I have written and spoken about < PROPFIRST > . The love that swells in my heart is such a blessing . 
Everything I do , Everwhere I look , everything reminds me of < PROPFIRST > . There is never a moment of the day that I do not think of her . 
I love < PROPFIRST > 
I have finally started writing newer compositions on cello and now piano in my collection called : ' the songs of a lovebird . ' Each song is about < PROPFIRST > and I . I hope that one day I can play them for her . 
< PROPFIRST > makes me feel like I'm the luckiest man ever born . I love her so much and through out and past all time I will still love her more and more . 
I have begun writing new songs for < PROPFIRST > and I think they are really good for the first . Though why should I expect any less- it's for < PROPFIRST > . She is the reason for everything good in me . 
I miss < PROPFIRST > , but I will make it through anything just to be with her again . 
Okay I have an advetisement for a friend of mine on deviantart : If you like anime and would like someone to draw a fanart of your request then my good ol ' pal TitanWarrior17 can do it . I'll put a link to his profile < PROPFEMALE > on my facebook profile . 
I so hypa for fall I don't know exactly why . I LOVE THE WIND , BUT NOT AS MUCH AS I LOOOOVE < PROPFIRST > ! <3 
My phrase of the day : YEAH ! BELIEVE IT !!! 
The seasons change throughout the year , but my love for < PROPFIRST > will never wither . My love for her will always grow stronger and stronger by every second that passes by . Sometimes by centimeters and at others by < PROPMALE > , but even millimeters can begin to add up . I love < PROPFIRST > so much and so entirely , with all my heart and soul .
