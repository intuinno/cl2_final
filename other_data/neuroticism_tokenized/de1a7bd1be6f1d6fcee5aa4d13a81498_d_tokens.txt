- Registration sucks . I have to petition 2 classes and I need written permission from one of my professors to override a time conflict . T____T 
Random Fact About Me : I have always hated the Land Before Time movies . Why ? In first grade , a classmate tried to serenade me with one of the songs , and I was extremely awkwarded out . Also , I don't think dinosaurs are that fascinating .

- Yaaaaaay film developing is done !!! Gotta wait a couple hours for it to dry before I go back to make my contact sheet ~ Photography is so damn fun ^_^

Going to the darkroom today ! I kinda hope it's not too crowded :/ 
AHHHHHH I just spent 5 hours in the darkroom ... this project had the perfect balance of fun and annoying . Now I'm exhausted . 
i whip my hair back and forth , i whip my hair back and forth ... 
ugh .... weird day - glad it's over . Turned in by < PROPMALE > print , people seemed to like it ^_^ Going to bed now , nite nite !! 
Too much homework and no motivation to do it all . I've procrastinated enough by now . 
Delainna Novak is now my makeup-experimentation doll . yay ^_^ 
Fun day with the boyfriend ^_^ Can't wait to go home for Thanksgiving next week !!! 
Getting ready to go home , can't wait to see my family ^_^ 
Sorry for the confusion - my boyfriend is kind of an idiot . 
Happy Thanksgiving !!! 
Painting my nails red - because it's Christmas-y !!!! 
Tangled was so cute !!!! Also , I'm finally downloading ME2 Overlord AND Lair of the Shadow Broker DLC .... looks like it'll be done downloading in ... 10 hours . Oh joy . 
ugh ... STILL downloading Overlord and Lair of the Shadow Broker - thank you computer for falling asleep and pausing my downloads T__T 
Putting up my pink Christmas tree and making snowflakes !!! But first .... must eat puppy chow !!! 
I'm super frustrated and just want to scream until my voice gives out - welcome to the final 2 weeks of classes ... 
This project is driving me crazy - there is not one single picture on two rolls of film that is good enough print and turn in T___T I might have to re-shoot this project ... 
Awesome evening of fun and relaxation , but the next week and a half is devoted to projects and finals ... yay . 
Too many people in the darkroom today . I know we all have final projects , but I still wanted to strangle someone - especially the chick who stole my enlarger . Grrrrrrrrrrr >:( 
I just feel like curling up in a ball and sleeping until the semester is over . I have way too much to do and it's making me sick . 
Graphic design project is done ! Now I must once again brave the darkroom ... it better not be busy again T___T 
I'm done with the < PROPMALE > projects !!!! Now all I have is a Japanese paper and an accounting assignment and I'll be okay for a while ^_^ 
I almost have 2 of 3 pages of my Japanese essay done - < PROPFEMALE > is keeping me company . 
I didn't go to bed until 3:30 and had to wake up at 7 - after a Rockstar and a Diet Coke , I'm not exactly sleepy , but I'm definitely brain dead . 
Wait . I'm supposed to be studying right now ? Wow ... I guess I kinda forgot . 
Kinda got owned by my Accounting final . Ugh . At least it's over . Time to study for Japanese !!! 
blah blah blah , Photography paper ........... 
I'm DONE !!!!!!!!! Haha hello Christmas vacation !!!! 
Can't think of a good status - there's nothing really noteworthy going on yet . I'm just bored . 
Didn't have the best Christmas ever - being sick kinda made everything less enjoyable . 
Possibly going back to < PROPMALE > tomorrow - dunno if I have to work or not . I'll miss being at home though , it's so comfy here ^_^ 
This is going to be a long Interim - I can feel it already . And I'm not even taking a class ... 
Made myself a smoothie with fresh strawberries ^_^ I'm content right now . 
I'm determined to clean up my room today - and also get some laundry done . yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay . 
I want Chinese food . Good Chinese food . 
Yaaaaaaaaaaaay work . 
work and then weekend !!!! geez these Hot Tamales are addicting - they burn so good !!!! 
Waiting for Mass Effect 2 to install on my PS3 ( Yes , install - and it's taking forever ) . I missed it so much - now I can play it here instead of waiting til I go home !!! 
I'm really sick and medicine isn't helping T____T 
Still sick - I feel yucky T___T 
Can't sleep - my brain won't shut up . 
Buying textbooks sucks . 
I forgot how long ME2 is ... and I'm pretty sure I've already failed the \everyone survives\ " part because Zaeed is an ass . " 
After realizing I've already failed at ME2 , I've decided to deal with my denial by playing Sims 3 until 2am . Though this new habit will be short lived since classes start on Monday T___T 
Great classes so far today , still waiting for Photography at 6:30 ^_^ I'm hoping this will be a good semester . 
I guess I'm gonna have to brave the snow to go to work ... 
yaaaaaaaay snow day . I think I'll clean my room and then play Sims for the rest of the day ^_^ 
I just realized about 20 minutes ago that I haven't eaten anything today - now I'm super hungry !!!! 
Watching the Super Bowl/America's Funniest Home Videos with Cooper Jones - and btw , the halftime show sucked . 
No Photo class this week - I have all my evenings to myself !! ( Except for work ) 
I'm hoping to get my hair cut tomorrow - short . As much as I like the idea of long hair , I'm kind of sick of it now . 
I gots my hairs cut !!!! Pictures later ! 
yay all caught up on my japanese homework ~ and I'm freezing cold ... time to snuggle up in my warm blankets and sleep ^_^ 
I just downloaded Picasa and I'm tagging all my photos - NINJA tagging . It wants me to tag everyone in the backgrounds of my Japan photos - hello people I don't know , you are forever in my memories ! 
Nasty headache to top off my unbearably long day . I can has weekend again now plz ? 
yay Friday . Probably going to Frederik Meijer Gardens today ^_^ 
ugh ... I'm dead tired and it's only Monday . Also , I'm suddenly craving late night < PROPMALE > and cheese ... but I'm too tired to make it . 
Already getting tired of this semester . Am I possibly getting senioritis a bit early ? 
rawr . Driving back to GR this morning . I'm jealous of all the people who have spring break right now , < PROPMALE>'s isn't for another two weeks ! 
Praying for Japan . 
McChicken + Shamrock shake = awesome 
It's FRIIIIIIEEEEDAY !!!! 
Secret Garden ( K-drama ) is getting really intense and it kinda just put me in a funky mood . It also doesn't help that I'm not tired right now and I just want to go somewhere . 
eeeeeee Tangled and the ME2 : Arrival DLC come out tomorrow ~ so much for homework :P 
When I get back from class I'm scanning in my photograms I made in Photography class on Monday .... they're pretty sweet ^_^ 
Got my color slides back - they came out awesome ! I wonder if I can scan them ... 
okay , that's probably a no on scanning my color slides - unless my scanner sucks . 
I had no idea < PROPMALE > Gibson was the voice of < PROPFIRST > Smith in Pocahontas .... nor did I know Christian Bale was the voice < PROPFIRST > . 
I saw a scared , stray dog running across Division and 44th this morning T_T hope the poor thing didn't get hit ... 
I forgot to mention I got my hair cut last Saturday - it's short ^_^ 
I might be getting sick - horrible headache , sniffly nose , and my hearing is tubular and amplified ( I can hear EVERYTHING but it's loud and annoying ! ) 
Laundry day ^_^ 
Planning out my life . Both exciting and frustrating . 
ME2 Arrival was meh . But I understand how it will have a big impact on ME3 . 
Screw beta testing , why did I not have Firefox 4 before now ?!?! 
Bad day . Topped off with a late work night . 
Can the semester be done now ? 
I kinda had to lol at when Attack of the Show was talking about the PSN hacking/outage - they told everyone to change their passwords ... I would if I could , but what part of \the network is down\ " don't you understand ? Herp derp . " 
doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot MORTAL KOMBAAAAAT ! 
Well , ain't that cuter than a < PROPMALE > bear wrapped in puppies ! 
Advertising presentation done ... phew . Just 2 finals , 2 papers ( one in Japanese ) , and 2 projects to go ! And I'm surprisingly not stressed out by any of it ... 
Happy Mother's Day , Gay < PROPFIRST > Halseth ! I love you ! 
Mom : \I like our new red grill ! \ " \ 
This new season of Doctor Who is freaking me out ... I can't decide if I like it or not :/
