Feeling a little scared and alone ... worried about my boyfriend who's in the hospital yet again . I can't be with him this time and they haven't called me yet . It's been almost 12 hours ... I've just been trying to sleep to pass the time , but it's difficult when he's not here . 
My boyfriend's back home and recooping . Things are looking up , for now . We'll see . 
Got a new phone and phone number for anyone who wants it or cares lol 
8 months with my boyfriend <3 new record for me . 
I can't sleep without you next to me . I miss you . 
Can't wait until my boyfriend can be released from the hospital . Can we have a bit of luck on our side for once ? Give us a break already . 
Home again and hopefully getting a new house ! If luck is in our favor that is : b 
Moving into our new house Friday ! <3 
Been in the hospital since Tuesday , hoping that we can go home tomorrow to our new home ! 
Every person has 1000 wishes , a cancer patient only has one : to get better . I know 97% of you won't post this as your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do , in honor of someone who died of/or is fighting cancer ... 
Is it sad that I'm already excited for Thanksgiving ? I can already feel the extra pounds ._. 
Hoping to be able to volunteer at the local animal shelter soon ! 
I miss my < PROPFEMALE > : c Mama loves you baby girl .

So my boyfriend is a little strange xD he talks in his sleep sometimes and this is the only time I've understood what he's said . \I fuckin hate taddle tales\ " <3 "

All of us have a thousand wishes to be thinner , to be bigger , have more money , have a cool car , a day off , a new phone , to date the person of your dreams . A cancer patient only has one wish -- to kick cancer's butt . I know that 97% of you won't post this as your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do . In honor of someone who died , or is fighting cancer , or even had cancer , post this for at least one hour :)

if you think i'm a good friend : like . \ 
if you hate me : message me and tell me why . \ 
if you ever had a crush on me , be honest : poke . \
