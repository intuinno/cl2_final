Take a look to the sky just before you die\ 
It is the last time he will\ 
Blackened roar , massive roar fills the crumbling sky\ 
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry\ 
\ 
Stranger now are his eyes to this mystery\ 
He hears the silence so loud\ 
Crack of < PROPFEMALE > , all is gone except the will to be\ 
Now they see what will be blinded eyes to see\ 
For whom the < PROPFEMALE > tolls\ 
Time marches on\ 
For whom the < PROPFEMALE > tolls-Metallica

walmart flashbacks !!! seriously !!!? wth ?!!! 
So tear me open , pour me out\ 
There's things inside that scream and shout\ 
And the pain still hates me\ 
Just like the curse , just like the stray\ 
You feed it once and now it stays\ 
Now it stays\ 
So tear me open but beware\ 
There's things inside without a care\ 
And the dirt still stains me 
3 days grace-I hate everything about you !

hahaha !! 
hey man look at me rock'in out \ 
im on the radio\ 
im on the video\ 
radio/video-system of a down 
just shoot me in the head . its quicker and we'll all be satisfied 
45 years ago they spoke out and they broke out\ 
of recession and oppression and they toked\ 
and they folked out with guitars around a bonfire\ 
just singin and clappin , man , what the hell happened ? \ 
some were spell bound and some were hell bound\ 
some they fell down and some got back up\ 
and fought against the meltdown\ 
and their kids were hippie chicks all hypocrites\ 
because fashion is smashin ' the true meaning of it 
it aint no joke when mammas handkerchief is soaked\ 
with the tears because her baby's life has been revoked\ 
the bond is broke up so choke up and focus on the closeup \ 
Mr. wizard cant reform no god , like hocus pocus 
so dont you sit back , kick back and watch the world get bushwacked\ 
news at 10:00 your neighborhood is under attack\ 
put away the crack before the crack , puts you away\ 
you need to be there when your baby's old enough to relate 
so dont delay , act now supplies are running out\ 
allow , if your still alive , 6 to 8 years to arrive\ 
and if you follow there may be a tomorrow but if\ 
the offers shun , ya might as well be walkin ' on the sun

a sleepless knight with armor that's lost its shine , a broken heart , a brown bag helmet and blind . giant Styrofoam shield gets in the way of whats reached for . newspaper boots run away from what was once sworn .

i dunno ... go to sleep ?.. or pull an all nighter since its already a new day ? 
misses old friends and randomness 
i is movin to LA on tuesday it looks like 
praying mantis's are partying at my place !... O.o 
so i guess theres this thing called a memory box .. the ones most painful and hardest to let go of , i bury in the darkness of its depths .. my last best hope .. is that they die .. so that i may find reason to live again .. no ... i do not live .. 
But you asked me to love you and i did . traded my emotions for a contract to commit . and when i got away i only kept my scars . The other me is dead . i hear his voice inside my head ! The other me is gone . now i dont know where i belong ! we were never alive . and we wont be born again . I will never survive . with dead memories in my Hea-rt ! ( x3 ) 
new phone so I may have to redo my contacts 
Life isn't real . So neither are you . :P 
reeses puffs !!! 
remember the days when we ACTUALLY poked eachother , instead this clicking some stupid button BS ?.... >:/ 
Yay gym ! 
Still losing .... 
I'm struggling ....
