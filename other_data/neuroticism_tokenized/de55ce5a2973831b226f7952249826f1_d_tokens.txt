Happy New Year =) 

Just got home , think I'm gonna eat a Hershey's bar . PSST ! My mom's being a fruitcake !! HELP !!! lol 
Proved a theory to myself , found a new fave song , and need to visit my friends . AND swim again , especially since I can't feel my face sunburn anymore ;) 
Eating bacon , being bored and alone on Facebook ( so wierd ) . Can't wait ' till this weekend . 
Early Week was brutal today . Especially on my heels ... i'll have to walk on my toes for the next week !! 
Grrrr . Frustrated . And sleepy . 
I just threw moldy bread at ppl ! Mom's SO obsessed with our ancestry- family tree thing . Apparently we're from < PROPFEMALE > ! And Denmark or some other generic European country ... 
Why is no one else on here at Seven-thirty AM ?? 
Listening to < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > , there's dog hair on my shirt , thinking about Fri+Sat . talking about a book , go figure , is way cooler than my friends ' friends lol . 
Disturbed by the shared insanity and talking at inanimate objects and the laughter at < PROPFEMALE > . 
Lots to think about at this early hour . Food , the fair , old memories , insane friends that I miss , stuff going on at Dad's . Etcetera . 
lol < PROPMALE > in the Middle . Somehow going to the fair tomorrow . Bad idea . Sort of . Yes it is . But it'll be funn . But it's wasteful and unnecessary . But it's only for a week .. I do not have Multi-Personality Disorder . That's just my consience . Boredd . No one 
Is going to see < PROPFEMALE > later on today . Mom simply HAS to see the Demolition Derby lol ;) =D =P 
Aww . i want to laugh and cry at the same time , especially cry . 
< PROPFEMALE > is so soft ! I wish toy companies made stuffed animals with blood so they'd be warmm . 
EHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH !! WHY !!!!! 
OWWWW !! Stupid box ' o springs thingy ... I probably RE-broke my toe ! 
I AM FINALLY HOME AGAIN !!!!!! WOOT 
I be going to sleep now , since there's 7 boxes of cereal to have for breakfast tomorrow . lol Mom , What were you thinking ?? 
I'm getting off before I lose ALL of my sanity . @_@ =D 
Upperclassmen are such dorks . At least us freshmen get our own wing of the school so we don't get picked on on a daily basis . 
I got to go with < PROPFEMALE > today to see Jeffafa Dun-HAMM . < PROPFEMALE > com . And ... it was AWESOME ! Especially the t-shirt gun and not-nosebleed seats we got to sit in after all . and now all 7 of us have matching shirts ! Dorkses we is . =D I is tired now . 
Going to Mammaw Givans ' house tomorrow , staying till Friday instead of next Monday . Jeez . Unfortuneately that means we won't get home until late afternoon =( Thanks for lending me the Maximum Ride books Tabbi . They're really exciting and cool . Real < PROPFEMALE > tu 
WAAH ! I'm going to be away from the internet or any computer until Friday afternoon =( But at least we get to spend time with eccentric Mammaw Givans , thus saving me from feeling bad for not visiting her . 
FACEBOOK EXPERIMENT : If you are reading this , even if we don't speak often , POST A COMMENT with a memory of you and me . When you've finished , post this paragraph on your own status and you'll be surprised at what people remember about you . Let's see what 
Had a great time at Six Flags today , only got a moderate sunburn , tubed down a toilet-bowl ;) and ate Dippin ' Dots . Cookies and Cream , of course . 
Internet brings me no comfort in the Boonies this day . Nothing to talk about with the ppl online right now . Wah-waaah . >=/ , ' =( 
lol < PROPFEMALE > , you're such a dork ;p Skating tomorrow night , but first , toaster strudels for breakfast . Go music ! Ugh , school in a few days . Let me enjoy the next .. 4 days as much as possible ! 
Grr . 
High school is so tiring . Especially gym with the World's Greatest Stretch . Oww . Why are mathbooks so HEAVY ?!?? After like 2 weeks of carrying around my ( heavy)stuff I'll need a brace for my back , a cane , and duh , a better satchel . 
Anybody wanna buy some not-frozen cookie dough ? PLEASE ?? All this begging makes me tired . G'Night smart , cookie-less buyers ! 
Woo 100 Bucks ! Don't you other band nerds TRY to get 10 sells tonite . DON'T DO IT ! 
Grr < PROPFIRST > . I dislike you with a passion ! I WILL win that money !!! 
Why is NOone online to hear i won $100 ?? Or talk about < PROPMALE > or how tired they'll be in 5hrs or something else for that matter . 
POCKY TREES ! 
GRRR ! 
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH !!! 
Do socks count as footwear ? 
Life is cruel . 
AIEEE ! Is ANYBODY I know going to homecoming tonight ?? 
Nevermind then ?? 
Strawberry Fields ! The Beatles is the best thing to listen to as we leave the clove of seasons . Pretty good music for any time I guess . 
One week left . Or 5 days . Or 2 weeks . Urgh . Cooking up some Ramen before reading City of Ashes to try and stockpile the little bit of Tabbi's zombie book I've read so far =) This weekend was great , staying up not so late last night after almost drowning in the Field of Screams lol . < PROPFEMALE > punched me this morning but I forgive her ;P 
Back from Gatlinburg with my cool new < PROPMALE > Davidson hat . The cabin we stayed at was niiice :) It had pool , air hockey , and foosball tables , and the jacuzzi . The land was really cool with all the mountain-ness and the sun shining ( for twice ) on parts of them . Too bad we didn't get to go ziplining or play lazer tag or something . What a weekend . ^_^ 
URGH !! SOMEONE please be on here !!! I've never felt so alone on Facebook . XP XD 
There is no word for this . 
Yay sleep ! I saw To Kill a Mockingbird in play form and helped strike it with all these professional tekkies . The show itself was cool , but all those effects screen things looked HEAVY ! Metallic mesh or somethign framed heavily with more metal , how nice . It was so great how all the older ' kids ' thought I was like 17 or something . Too bad I can't even boast the lawful ability to drive yet =/ Goodnight Facebook ! 
The stars < PROPFEMALE > down to kiss you , and I lie awake and miss you . Pour me a heavy does of atomoshpere , cause I'll doze off safe and soundly , but I'll miss your arms around me . I'd send a postcard to you Dear , cause I wish you were here . 
I am taking a quiz , the question is this : Which word appeals to you most ? 1)Carousel 2)Rouge 3)Fruit 4)Moon 5)zeppelin(blimp thing)6)Poke . So I made up a story cause I can't decide on which word I like best . There was a zeppelin that flew by the < PROPFEMALE > on its way to get fruit and the captain wears imported rouge which fell out the window to where children were on a carousel getting poked with sticks . 
WILL BE COMPLETELY HONEST FOR 24 HOURS ... you can ask me one question ( only in my inbox ) . Any question no matter how crazy , sinister , or wrong it is I will answer it no matter what . You have my full honesty , but I DARE you to put this as your status and see what questions you get ... 
People of FarmTown ! Please send Cherryblossom trees ! 
Is ANYBODY going to the Nutcracker thing next Thursday ?? 
I like 80's music lol . Stupid VH1 is growing on me . Evil tv .. WHO IS < PROPFIRST > J GOING TO CHOOSE ?? The suspense is maddening !!! 
Had the most random dream this morning including marshmellow creme , peroxide , a HUGE slide , and a wedding ... 
Once again , out of books . I've read like EVERY one in the house . Ugh . ( hint hint < PROPFEMALE > ) 
Writing a memoir about the PAC . Where to begin ... ;P 
I wish SOMEONE in my house would remember HOW TO DO THE DISHES . Seems like I'm the only one besides Mammaw who knows how to LOAD A DISHWASHER . D=<
