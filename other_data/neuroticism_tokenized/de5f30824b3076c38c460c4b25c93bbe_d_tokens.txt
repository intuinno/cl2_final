Found out today how much he misses airsoft . which is A LOT ! so is now wondering how many guys would be interested in joining an airsoft club at MHS ? we could do some skirmishes every other week or whatever and i could invite all yall to go on our FBC PAINTBALL trip that we are doin every 5-6 months . so how about it ? ( like this status if you would at least be interested ) 
hahaha i killed my song for District auditions !! It was the best ive sang it lol =) 
Needs some more people to play airsoft on the 25th with at calvary chapel . Txt me if you are interested . itll be at like 5:00 pm till we decide to stop playing or people have to leave
