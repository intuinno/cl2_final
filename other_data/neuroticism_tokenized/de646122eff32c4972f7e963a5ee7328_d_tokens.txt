And the rains came ! It's pouring cats & dogs here right now . 60% < PROPMALE > of rain today . Bring it on . We need it . Just not the nasty heavy destructive storms . Let's get the drought taken care of . Thank you LORD ! Rainy day Monday and it's kind a kool ! Ya'll 

WOW ! Sensory overload today ! Lots to do and too little time to do it . Ain't life grand ?? Never a dull moment ! JUST wondering what the LORD will turn up in my life today ?? What an exciting journey this life is when you take it with HIM as your guide & comp 
And I will raise me up a faithful priest , that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind : and I will build him a sure house ; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever . -1 < PROPFIRST > 2:35 
Lookin for a great weekend and lots going on . This week has been slammed but it's been all good and I have been super blessed by the LORD ! HE is amazing and so Awesome in HIS LOVE !! 
Obedience is the < PROPFIRST > of the true believer ! Are you a person of integrity ?, of your word ? Is your yes , yes & your no no ? Do you make promises and then xcuse your actions when you don't keep them ? AND most specifically have you promised the LORD something 
What a fantastic weekend . And , what a beginning to the new week . The LORD continues to bless and grow me as well as my ministry and my biz . It doesn't get any better or more exciting than when you are walking with HIM and holding on to the hand that leads 
Another extremely busy ay at the office but a good one . Lots of good things happening . Agape ' is on my mind and in my tho'ts these days . It is that wonderful property of Agape ' that builds the unity in the \BODY of CHRIST\ " that is so necessary for the BOD " 
OOPS ? Sometimes this site is too slow and it doesn't work as fast as you keyboard . Don't forget the quote from the movie , ' Fools Rush IN ' ! \You will never know LOVE until you surrender to it\ " !! AGAPE ' is IT people ! " 
Wonderful day and opportunity to see the LORD working out HIS LOVE on behalf of HIS KIDS ! I'm so glad I'm one of them ! Aren't you ? 
To sum up , all of you be harmonious , sympathetic , brotherly , kindhearted , and humble in spirit ; not returning evil for evil or insult for insult , but giving a blessing instead ; for you were called for the very purpose that you might inherit a blessing . CO

OK , it's time for the weekend and R&R Deluxe ! Whatever that is ! Ha ha ! Ya'll enjoy & be blessed !!!! 
AGAPE'! This is how the true believer should live . Romans 12 principles , totally surrendered to allow the LORD to fill their lives with HIS AWESOME LOVE that HE would empower & enable them to be HIS hands & feet but more importantly , HIS HEART to the worl 
Therefore I , the prisoner of the Lord , implore you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called , with all humility and gentleness , with < PROPFEMALE > , showing tolerance for one another in love , being diligent to preserve the unity 
Romans 12:9 -12 { Let } love { be } without hypocrisy . Abhor what is evil ; cling to what is good . { Be } devoted to one another in brotherly love ; give preference to one another in honor ; not lagging behind in diligence , fervent in spirit , serving the Lord ; rejo 
The greatest force on earth is not the compulsion of law but the compassion of love ! I feel great sadness for those who have not compassion for they will never know love as they will not surrender to it ! CHRIST IS the ULTIMATE EXPRESSION of LOVE & COMPASSION ! 
Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror and , after looking at himself , goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like . But the man who looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom , and continues to do this , not forgetting what he has heard , but doing it -- he will be blessed in what he does . < PROPFIRST > 1:23 -25 NIV 
A nice fresh pot of Caramel Truffle Coffee and some quiet time in the WORD ! What does HE have planned for me today ?? Time to find out the next step . 
The Bible : Read it , Believe it , Obey it ! You don't really know the Bible unless you obey the Bible ! And , what is the Bible but the WORD and what is the WORD but CHRIST ! If you don't really know HIM you won't obey HIM ! The deeper your relationship with HIM the greater and easier it is to obey HIM ! Then HIS GRACE & LOVE will be reflected in your life ! 
Hope is the feeling we have that the feeling we have is not permanent . ~ < PROPFEMALE > McLaughlin 
I lift up my eyes to the hills -- where does my help come from ? My help comes from the LORD , the Maker of heaven and earth . He will not let your foot slip -- he who watches over you will not slumber ; indeed , he who watches over < PROPMALE > will neither slumber nor sleep . The LORD watches over you -- the LORD is your shade at your right hand ; the sun will not harm you by day , nor the < PROPFEMALE > by night . The LORD will .. Pslm 121 
The LORD will keep you from all harm -- he will watch over your life ; the LORD will watch over your coming and going both now and forevermore . Psalm 121:1 -8 NIV ( See previous comment for first part . ) 
I sought the LORD , and he answered me ; he delivered me from all my fears . Those who look to him are radiant ; their faces are never covered with shame . This poor man called , and the LORD heard him ; he saved him out of all his troubles . The angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear him , and he delivers them . Taste and see that the LORD is good ; blessed is the man who takes refuge in him . Psalm 34:4 -8 NIV 
In love he predestined us to be adopted as his sons through Jesus Christ , in accordance with his pleasure and will -- to the praise of his glorious grace , which he has freely given us in the One he loves . Ephesians 1:3 -6 Cont'd above comment 
Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ . For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight . See previous commment for the whole quote ! 
Looks like Facebook is in the duplication process today ! OR ~ ~ Maybe the LORD wants to impact someone with this one today ! 
Send out your light and your truth ; let them guide me . Let them lead me to your holy mountain , to the place where you live . \ —Psalm 43:3 " 
If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels , but have not love , I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal . If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge , and if I have a faith that can move mountains , but have not love , I am nothing . If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames , but have not love , I gain nothing . 1 Corinthians 13:1 -3 NIV 
The LORD's ways are higher than our ways , who can understand them ! 
I will praise the LORD at all times , I will constantly speak HIS praises . I will boast only in the LORD ; let all who are discouraged take heart . Come , let us tell of the LORD's greatness ; let us exalt HIS name together . I prayed to the LORD and HE answered me , freeing me from all my fears . Psalm 34:1 -4 
Blessed are those who have not seen and yet believed ! LORD , give me the faith to believe altho I have not seen . May I be blessed with strong faith through your HOLY SPIRIT ! 
< PROPFEMALE > is awaiting God's time without doubting God's love ! God Himself has said , \I will never leave you nor forsake you . \ " Hebrews 13:5 " 
Praise the LORD , O my soul ; all my inmost being , praise his holy name . Praise the LORD , O my soul , and forget not all his benefits- who forgives all your sins and heals all your diseases , who redeems your life from the pit and crowns you with love and compassion , who satisfies your desires with good things so that your youth is renewed like the eagle's . Psalm 103:1 -5 NIV AMEN ! 
Closing down for the day . Hope ya'll had a good Monday ! 
Gal . 6:1 -3 Brethren , even if anyone is caught in any trespass , you who are spiritual , restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness ; { each one } looking to yourself , so that you too will not be tempted . Bear one another's burdens , and thereby fulfill the law of Christ . For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing , he deceives himself .

And this I pray , that your love may abound still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment , so that you may approve the things that are excellent , in order to be sincere and blameless until the day of Christ . Philippians 1:9 , 10 NASB 
He has told you , O man , what is good ; And what does the LORD require of you But to do justice , to love kindness , And to walk humbly with your God ? < PROPFIRST > 6:8

Today has been both a sad but joyous day . Sad because I have lost my mother as she graduated into < PROPFEMALE > today & is no longer with us . Rejoincing because she is in the presence of the LORD celebrating true LIFE with HIM and rejoicing with all her friends and family who have gone on before . I imagine that they are having the best party ever . Thank you all !

Packing it all in my daughters car trunk to leave for the airport after church to return to Florida . I will miss them so very much ! What a family I have been blessed with by the LORD ! It is such a joy to see your children and their families following the Lord . I Thank and Prasie the Lord for that blessing ! 
Getting ready to leave for the office and missing my daughter and her family and someone else that is very special in my life ! Being apart from those you love is so frustrating ! May the Lord keep , bless and surround us all with HIS LOVE today ! 
As God's fellow workers we urge you not to receive God's grace in vain . For he says , ' In the time of my favor I heard you , and in the day of salvation I helped you . ' I tell you , now is the time of God's favor , now is the day of salvation . 2 Corinthians 6:1 -2 NIV 
Leavin on a jet plane ! HA ! 
People who say they are Christian but act otherwise . If you say you are something then be it . Don't just be an opportunist and user and lie about who you really are as you will ultimately be found out ! Be REAL and BE YOU , the REAL DEAL ! At least then people will be able to trust you and be willing to realate to you for who you are and not who they think you are . As the good book says , ' let love be without hypocrisy ' . 
May we all be true in our friendships .

The night is nearly over ; the day is almost here . So let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light . Let us behave decently , as in the daytime , not in orgies and drunkenness , not in sexual immorality and debauchery , not in dissension and jealousy . Rather , clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ , and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the sinful nature . Romans 13:12 -14 NIV 
Finally , tonite I'll have hi-speed at home and no more snail's pace & worse < PROPFEMALE > loads ! So glad that technology is finally catching up to the countryside ! 
To the one we are the smell of death ; to the other , the fragrance of life . And who is equal to such a task ? Unlike so many , we do not peddle the word of God for profit . On the contrary , in Christ we speak before God with sincerity , like men sent from God . 2 Corinthians 2:14 -17 NIV 
But thanks be to God , who always leads us in triumphal procession in Christ and through us spreads everywhere the fragrance of the knowledge of him . For we are to God the aroma of Christ among those who are being saved and those who are perishing . 
Could we with ink the ocean fill , And were the skies of parchment made , Were every stalk on earth a quill , And every man a scribe by trade , To write the love of God above Would drain the ocean dry . Nor could the scroll contain the whole , Though stretched from sky to sky . - Meir < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > Nehorai

SHutting down & heading home 4 the weekend ! YEAAAAAAA GOD ! 
TO LOVE & BE LOVED , one of the deepest heart < PROPFEMALE > s . Perhaps that < PROPFEMALE > is there because it is GOD GIVEN & the deepest < PROPFEMALE > is for that relationship with HIM . Sometimes , that begins wtih YOU , & CHRIST in YOU , loving them . They need a JESUS with skin to show them GOD's LOVE ! Jesus said that HE had NOT come to be served , but to serve ! Are we serving ? are we other person centered rather than sefl centered ?? Selah ! 
Galatians 6:1 -3 Brethren , if a man is overtaken in any trespass , you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness , considering yourself lest you also be tempted . Bear one another's burdens , and so fulfill the law of Christ For if anyone thinks himself to be something , when he is nothing , he deceives himself . 
Galatians 6:7 -9 Do not be deceived , God is not mocked ; for whatever a man sows , that he will also reap . For he who sows to his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption , but he who sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap everlasting life . And let us not grow weary while doing good , for in due season we shall reap if we do not lose heart . 
Galatians 6:10 Therefore , as we have opportunity , let us do good to all , especially to those who are of the household of faith . 
Superbowl ?? Who DAT ?? Saints or Colts Whadda ya think ?? TGIF folks ! Be blessed ! 
For if anyone is a hearer of the word & not a doer , he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror ; for once he has looked at himself & gone away , he has immediately forgotten what kind of person he was . But one who looks intently at the perfect law , the { law } of < PROPFEMALE > , & abides by it , not having become a forgetful hearer but an effectual doer , this man will be blessed in what he does < PROPFIRST > 1:23 -25 NASB 
Little children , let us not love with word or with tongue , but in deed and truth . 1 < PROPFIRST > 3:18 But prove yourselves doers of the word , and not merely hearers who delude themselves . < PROPFIRST > 1:22 NASB

Whatsoever a man sows , he will also reap ! Lord Jesus , help me to sow your love in others lives today that you might reap the harvest ! 
Jesus said that in my weakness HIS strength would be made known ! May this be more true today than ever ~ Proverbs 3:5 -6 ( KJV ) 5 Trust in the LORD with all thine heart ; and < PROPFEMALE > not unto thine own understanding . 6 In all thy ways acknowledge him , and he shall direct thy paths . LORD JESUS , in my weakness may I acknowledge you that you may direct my path today & foreve ! AMEN ! 
Fill your life with LOVE ! ( GOD is LOVE ) You become what you practice most . Practice LOVE and when you die your in-basket won't be empty ! LOVE & Happiness are both choices we make ! Choose wisely ! 
Time to shut down the office and go take care of a client before I hit home and R&R ! Ya'll have a great evening . 
Have you ever considered that the words spoken to others either in person or print become very real part of your persona and those very words color how you are visualized/seen by others . Are your words those which would give others a picture of a beautiful & loving person or those which create a picture of ugliness , criticalism & negativity . Choose your words wisely . 
Our relationship with HIM is key to growth , healing & revelation of HIS truth in our lives !!

Borrowed from a neat Sister in the LORD : We come to love not by finding a perfect person , but by learning to see an imperfect person perfectly . Via cousin < PROPFIRST > Hayes 2007 with thanks \This is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved you . \ " < PROPFIRST > 15:12 May we each perfectly love even the imperfections in one another . :-) wjc .

When you have a heart to seek HIM & HIS Kingdom , HE will enlighten you thru the HOLY SPIRIT and bring the WORD alive and write it in your heart ! I want HIS WORD stamped indelibly upon my heart ! Praise the LORD and let the LORD inhabit your praise ! Invite HIS presence and your awareness of it that you might walk and talk with HIM daily !

Love is the most important thing . It's not about how much you have , how much you know , or how much you do . It's about how well you love . Love is what matters most . \ 
1 Cor . 13 
Galations 5:22 -26 But the fruit of the Spirit is love , joy , peace , longsuffering , gentleness , goodness , faith , Meekness , temperance : against such there is no law . And they that are CHRIST's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts . If we live in the Spirit , let us also walk in the Spirit . Let us not be desirous of vain < PROPFEMALE > , provoking one another , envying one another .

Fantastic teaching . This is a terrific opportunity to be able to watch this via webcast . 
Just finished the general cleaning up from the leak & flood from under the kitchen sink I found when I returned home Wed evening . What a pain it was ! Thank the LORD it is fixed now and just some more clean-up to do . Had enough of this for a couple of days . Gotta get me cleaned up now and run into the office to get away from it and enjoy some regular business and get set for next week ! 
PRAISE GOD FROM WHOM ALL BLESSINGS FLOW ! 
He who is born of GOD should grow to resemble the FATHER ! \ 
Growing up into the fullness and maturity of CHRIST ! \ 
Are we becoming mature believers ?? Or are we becoming adult children ? 
Simply put , the enemy of our eternal soul has a threefold plan . \ 
1 . He deceives ! \ 
2 . He defiles ! \ 
3 . He destroys ! \ 
My brethren , do not be unaware of the wiles and schemes of the enemy but be on the alert as he prowls about as a roaring lion seeking whom he might devour ! 
Have to get a bit ~ o ~ work done on my car . Nothing serious but necessary so nothing serious does come my way !

Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess , for He who promised is faithful ( Hebrews 10:23 )\ 
Do this , keep quiet and stay out out of GOD's way and let HIM work . Only respond to and do what HE calls you to do ! Walk in obedience to HIS WORD & command ! 
\TO LOVE TRULY\ " \ 
GOD is still in control and HE LOVES to BLESS HIS KIDS ! But we need to surrender and get out of HIS way and let HIM bring us the desires of our heart , the ones that HE has placed so deeply within us . \ 
As my favorite quote by POGO says ; \WE has met the enemy & he is us\ " !! \ 
\WHERE PRAYER FOCUSES 
When our lives become a prayer to HIM we make HIM a conscious part of our day as we walk , talk & fellowship with HIM thruout our day > !!! Enjoying HIS PRESENCE as we would any other of our friends if we were spending the day with them . Let us spend each day inviting HIM to walk , talk and be a part of our life and living this day ! 
Thanks to < PROPFEMALE > Bucklin for this one ! \ 
A true friend doesn't care when you're broke , what you weigh , if your house is a mess , about your past , or if your family is filled with crazies , they love you for who you are . A true friend can go long periods of time without speaking and never question the friendship . Repost if you have one true friend . They will know who they are . 
JESUS ! HE is the friend that sticks closer than a brother and it is HE that walks with you , goes before you , stands beside you , HE has your back , and underneath are the everlasting arms of a passionate and loving HEAVENLY FATHER . 
Being happy doesn't mean everything is perfect . It means you care enough to see beyond imperfections . \ 
LOVE IS ... giving someone the power to break your heart , but trusting them not to . \ 
May all of your weeds be wildflowers . 
If you truly belong to HIM you cannot but help to realize the passion and LOVE that HE has for HIS KIDS and to respond with a passion and LOVE for HIM and your life begins at the moment of receiving HIM & that realization of HIM as LORD OF LORD's , < PROPMALE > OF < PROPMALE > S and the LOVER OF OUR ETERNAL SOUL > ! 
Sometimes you are encouraged about our country's future when you see something like this . Specifically , there is an annual contest at Texas A&M UniversityCalling for the most appropriate definition of a contemporary term . This year's term was \Political Correctness . \ " T " 
1 Cor . 13 Tells us what LOVE is and does & what it is not and what it does not do ! It is the ultimate definition of LOVE and the reality of what GOD IS & that is LOVE ! \ 
Love covers a multitude of sins . HIS LOVE covered all SIN ! \ 
And CHRIST said \Let LOVE be without hypocrisy\ " ! \ 
Life can be so fragile & as the WORD says , it is even as a vapor ! It's too short to use it up playing games & not loving as CHRIST LOVES & would have us love . Let us LOVE one another as HE desires for us to LOVE & let us not be harsh with one another but in LOVE forgive & reach out to others that they might be won to HIM ! 
Just finished a < PROPFEMALE > Laptop job and it's time to shut down and crash for the nite ! \ 
Blessings Ya'll! See ya t'morrow .

God has not called you to be a cookie-cutter copy of some one else ... But God wants to use you just the way you are ( uniquely & individually made ) ... He has a people that he wants to reach thru you who are literally waiting for you to get in position with God & show up ... Don't allow man to change you ~ allow God to mold & shape you into what he has called you do be in Jesus name ~ Amen\

When you < PROPFEMALE > the Bible , Satan gets a headache ... When you open it , he \

Thanks 2 < PROPFIRST > Crabb 4 this one ! \ 
This is why Disobedience is such a big deal . \ 
When we\ 
are disobedient , we are actually allowing the evil one to live out his \ 
desires in us , and he always takes more than we want to give him ! \

2:2 Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this \ 
world , according to the < PROPMALE > of the power of the air , the spirit that \ 
now worketh in the children of disobedience :

Psalm 33:18 Behold , the eye of the LORD is on those who fear Him , on those who hope in His mercy , \

Psalm 55:22 Cast your burden on the LORD , & He shall sustain you ; He shall never permit the righteous to be moved . ( NKJV ) 
This one bears another turn on the post ! \

Ran across a couple of profiles that had been \upgraded\ " to the new profile and I think the new profile thingy sucks ! Facebook is losing it ! I don't want any screwed up upgrades to my profile for sure ! If you don't want it be sure you DON\ " T CLIK ON THAT ^&*$# BUTTON LINK >!!!!!!!!!!!!" 
Facebook is sure pushing the new profile ! How do you guys feel about this one . Do you like it or did you get hijacked into the new profile ??? AND now you cant ' get out ! 
Socialism is a philosophy of failure , the creed of ignorance and the gospel of envy , its inherent virtue is the equal sharing of misery . 
This new < PROPFEMALE > sucks ! I didn't ask for it either ! 
Missing someone very dear to me today ! She's a very special person and the LORD has blessed me by bringin her into my life ! 
LORD , please give me wisdom and understanding that I might please you in all that I do ! \ 
AMEN !

In the PRESENCE Of the LORD is LIGHT , LIFE & LOVE THAT NEVER FAILS ! \ 
In the presence of evil there is the exact opposite , a lack of light , life & love & an existence without GOD ! \ 
With GOD there is wonderful relationship & without HIM there is a terrible loneliness that eats your soul ! \ 
Behold , He put before you LIFE & DEATH , Blessing & Cursing . CHOOSE LIFE ! 
HE IS , EVER FAITHFUL , Always keeps HIS PROMISES , LOVES HIS KIDS PASSIONATELY , WOOes them AWESOMELY , HIS LOVE NEVER FAILS and HE ALWAYS BRINGS HIS KIDS INTO HIS LIGHT ! \ 
We have BLESSINGS of ABUNDANCE FROM HIS INEXHAUSTIBLE RICHES IN GLORY ! \ 
How can we miss when we belong to HIM > !!??!! 
1 < PROPFIRST > 3 ! This is a great chapter . I always wonder about some people that claim to be believers but their behavior doesn't seem to match up with some of these verses and principles . I jusst don't understand it nor do I understand the excuses that are used to justify some behaviors . \ 
Oh well , Cest La vie ! \ 
Blessings all !

About to watch Founders Week again tonight . < PROPFIRST > Chapman , author and Counselor is speaking tonight . I was up for it until my last phone call . Now I'm not so sure . This was one of those phone calls that you're damned if you do and damned if you don't . \ 
< PROPFIRST > Chapman is good and I need something really good right now . 
Sometimes it's hard but still ! \ 
Phillipians 4:8 
I have wept enough for one night . I need a couple of hours rest at least . \ 
Nite all ! 
The LORD is good and greatly to be praised ! \ 
Last nite was a very trying and depressing situation for me . I now have an awesome praise report as a result of that which the LORD allowed me to go thru last nite . ( Continued in comments below )
