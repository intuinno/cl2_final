Put this as your status if you know someone who suffers from being a Ravens fan . Being a Ravens fan is a real disorder and should be taken seriously . There is no known cure for RFD and sympathy does not help ... but we can raise awareness . 100% of Steelers fans will re-post this , simply because we KNOW HOW to copy and paste . Go Steelers Go !!! 
To everyone who is calling for stricter gun laws in light of the tragedy in Tucson , may I offer this little tidbit : If guns kill people , then pencils misspell words , cars drive drunk , and spoons made Oprah fat ! Remember : Hold the PERSON accountable for their actions , not the means they chose to utilize !!! ( Reposted from another friend's status message . Feel free to do the same . ) 
so one question ... how bout them patriots ?
