My Niece Mikkie is in critical condition at the Primary Children's hospital after drowning in Bear Lake ... Please keep her in your prayers 
My poor niece has died ... what a terribly sad day . No much else to say except for thank goodness for the knowledge of the Gospel of Jesus Christ 
Thanks for the prayers & thoughtful comments . Today put the reality of death into perspective . It was the first death in my direct family except for great grandparents . Treating each day as a True Gift has a deeper meaning now and dramatically enlightened my perspective . < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPMALE > & Faith Harper are such amazing people ... so grateful for the support of family and friends seen and unseen . 
The Lord takes many away , even in infancy , that they may escape the envy of man , \ 
and the sorrows and evils of this present world ; they were too pure , too lovely , \ 
to live on earth ; therefore , if rightly considered , instead of mourning we have \ 
reason to rejoice as they are delivered from evil , and we shall soon have them \ 
again ... \ - < PROPFIRST > Smith "

too funny :-) 
My\
