When am i going to realize i am me and its not going to change ? 
Why is it so hard for me to realize that I am me and its not going to change ? 
WHY IS IT THAT EACH TIME I THINK OF YOU I GET A < PROPFEMALE > IN MY EYE THAT EVERYONE CAN SE ... http://chatter.com/a/idrqv?ref=nf 
At least i got out before it got worse . 
Ok so its cold outside and my dogs dont want to come in ugh . 
its cold ... the sun will come out tommorrow bet ya bottom dollar that tomorrow there will be sun ... or however the song goes lol 
Its cold ... and yes i am complaining 
so bored . 
I can't take it anymore . The pain of seeing you and then you are gone like smoke in wind storm . I need to realize your never going to come and I just need to get you outta my mind . Outta sight outta mind right ? But i guess this only happens in some cases huh . 
A Veteran is someone , who at one point in their life , wrote a blank check payable to the United States of < PROPFEMALE > for an amount up to , and including , their life . That is beyond honor , and there are way too many people in this country who no longer remember that fact . Copy and .. paste this as your status if you are a Veteran , know a Veteran , Love a Veteran or support the Troops . 
Had the best weekend ever . Fruita is the shit lol . Cant wait to go back . I even got a new phone lol . 
I no every1 misses Yiovanni . We need 2 let him rest in peace & let everything go . His family & the friends tht r blaming his other friends need 2 stop . They didnt have anything 2 do with wht happen except tht they were w/him when he died . We all need 2 stop makin it worse then wht it is already . I didn't no him personally but I think he would not want his family & some of his friends blaming others . R.I.P. Yiovanni 
If you have to heard yet . The ranger that was shot last night died . hope they find the dumb ass who shot him and are not very nice . 
Just found out the truth . The ranger is in stable condition . Sorry heard wrong news . \\n LOOKING 4WARD 
LOST DOG !!!!! \ 
Name : Rosco \ 
Sex : Male\ 
Type : Boston Terrier\ 
Color : Black and white\ 
Might be mistaken for a english bulldog or a boxer . He is tall for a Boston terrier and is very friendly and loves other animals and people . He has been missing since 9:00 this morning on murphy < PROPFIRST > . If you have seen him , know where he is , or have any information please call , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > at 435-26 0-0 837 or 435-259-2930 . Thank you . 
Great phone is shut off and I am so bored . hopefully it gets turned on later today . :) 
Thankgiving is so boring so far . Its really cold and it sucks 
Wow flat tire in 24 degree weather sucks . 
If u think its ok or not for a guy that has a girlfriend to go to a strip club/bar where he can get lap dances then message me ur opinions . \\n LOOKING 4WARD 
I miss < PROPFIRST > . I dont got school no more lol 
So very bored . I hate not having anything to do in the evenings . 
you know there are just some things that we cant change in life and we jsut have to learn to deal with them and go on and be the best we can be even if everyone is trying to bring you down . 
Its funny how people can use you and will ask or tell you to fo something and you wont say \no\ " . Cuz you dont want to hurt anyone . " 
I found someone to take away the heartache . To take away the loneliness I ' ve been feelin ' since you've been gone . Since you've been gone - < PROPFEMALE > 
great fucking sick and not good me staying home from work . 
I dont know what to do anymore . 
Let's see how creative my Facebook friends are ... Leave me a 1-word comment that best describes me using the THIRD letter of YOUR FIRST Name .. ( SCARY THOUGHT :) . It can only be 1 word ... Then copy and paste this to your wall so I can leave a word about you ... Don't just post a word & not copy , that's ...... no fun ! ( Let the fun begin ) 
Gotta go home tomorrow . Not to happy about it but guess you gotta do what you gotta do . 
A final comfort that is small , but not cold : The heart is the only broken instrument that works . 
F**k all the trust . F**k all the feelings . F**k all the kisses you were stealing . F**k all the talks and lying , but most of all ... F**k you and all the crying . 
Why is it when i start to like someone and i mean really like someone something happens and i have to end up leaving . It sucks and it hurts and i hate it . 
Hmmm idk anymore . whats the point in getting your hopes up to have them destroyed , opening your heart up to just have it ripped out and trampled on in front of you ? I'm done with it all . Not going to take the pain anymore i am giving up on you and there ever being an us . I have held on to my feelings long enough . Im letting them go and setting myself free . 
What to do ? Idk about this anymore . Maybe i should give up and not even try . 
Its funny how u can luv some1 so much & they have no clue . Its funny how u can look in2 their eyes & get butterflies . U wish u had the courage 2 say something , 2 let them no u care . That will always b there 4 them even in the darkest times . There comes a point when they will disappear . They will find some1 new cuz the whole time u were waiting 4 them ... they were waiting 4 u . 
Not ready for < PROPFIRST>'s day . 
Fuck boys and me falling easy . Im sick of this shit . Done with boys .
