Goodmorning Jesus ... 
One thing I ask of the LORD , this is what I seek : that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life , to gaze upon the beauty of the LORD and to seek him in his < PROPFEMALE > . Psalm 27:4 
Thanks < PROPFEMALE > ... this is soooo true ... Life is too short to wake up with regrets . So love the people who treat you right . Pray for the one's who don't . Believe everything happens for a reason . If you get a second < PROPMALE > , grab it with both hands . If it changes your life , let it . Nobody said life would be easy , they just promised it would be worth it . Post to your wall if you agree 
Love is to be vulnerable . Love is the opening of the heart , the welcoming of your beloved . Loving is not secure , authentic loving is risky . Security lies behind the walls of a closed heart . You either invite the union by opening in love , or you secure the isolation by closing down ... thanks < PROPFEMALE > ! :o )
