Why can't the weekend last longer ? 
Shar , < PROPFEMALE > or Ruth : What time does the picnic start on Sat ? Will there be any music ? 
making baked beans for the VFW picnic , get to sit out in the heat , eat , drink and have fun later 
Back from picnic , it was very hot . But lots of good food and great people . Left before the music started to visit Shadyside , good to be back home in the A/C . Now , who's going to scrub the floors ? 
VFW Ladies Aux-meeting tonite at 7:00 . Hope to see you all there . We need 5 members to be present .

came home from work , pulled car into garage , got out and was met by a strange little dog who had followed my car into garage . Friendly little bugger , my big doggie wanted to play but I made him stay inside . Called phone # on collar but no answer so left a voicemail . I hope somebody calls me back !!

returned < PROPFEMALE > to the shelter . He fared better than I did . My spirit aches . 
got home and furnace was not working . Hubby sitting in t-shirt and bare feet , furnace is running and blowing cold air and doesn't know the difference . 
getting ready to go to Deersville for their Community Theatre play . Looks like a nice day for a drive . 
Wonders why men choose to ignore a full trash bag and when they do lower themselves to tying it up and taking it out they choose to ignore the items that have fallen out of the bag and leave them for future generations to deal with ... 
Does anyone own a breadmaking machine ? Do you like it ? Do you use it ? Any recommendations ? 
wonders why some people would rather let others worry than make a 30 second phone call or voicemail to update on one's situation . 
TGIF ! Happy Weekend All !!

has wrapped 2 small gifts and is running out of steam ... long way to go . I think I can , I think I can ! 
The < PROPFEMALE > Truck |” \”; .. 
must remember not to run the dishwasher and the microwave at the same time as it trips the breaker in the basment ! ;-( 
is remembering a story of an ancestor who lived near Philadelphia ( I think on the Hawes side for those who are related ) who only ate cookies and drank whisky . She died when the still in her basement blew the house apart . I'm beginning to think she had the right idea !! 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas to all my family , friends , co-workers and FB friends . May you all have a blessed holiday !
