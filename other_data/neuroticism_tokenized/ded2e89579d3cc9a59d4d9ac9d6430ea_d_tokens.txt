lots of things running through my head ( Ireland stuff , finals , summer plans , etc . ) , some of which i need to chilax about . i need to calm down and focus on the good things , even if they're little , to get through this stressful season :)

hm , woke up at 6am ... why ?! time to go back to bed . 
so ... thanks , facebook , for not telling me you reset all my privacy settings to make them practically public . REAL HELPFUL . 
as i was throwing away a garbage bag of empty bottles , one of the many cats that live in our apartment's garage was watching my bag intensely . when i turned back on my way out , i saw the cat going through the bag , licking the bottles . point of the story : i think i got a < PROPFEMALE > cat drunk . 
wishing i could go on the hike to < PROPFIRST > tomorrow , since it'll probs be the last one of the semester i could do , but the need to do the week's worth of work i avoided while my parents were here outweighs that option . awe well , reading galore tomorrow for me ! 
i just giggled at my own fart . i think i may have a slight maturity problem ... 
football player at the pub , asking how to open a bottle of champagne , while shaking it like crazy . that was before the team started throwing glasses and falling off of the tables . according to my < PROPFEMALE > friends , this is but only a preview of what is to come on st. < PROPFIRST>'s day ;) 
jealous seeing statuses talking about spring break when i still have three more weeks ... but then i remember that i'm spending my month long spring break in < PROPFIRST > , rome , < PROPFEMALE > , cinque terre , < PROPFEMALE > , vienna , budapest , krakaow , prague , athens , santorini , and istanbul and suddenly don't feel so bad anymore :D 
i officially LOVE pancakes day . 
did you write the book of love and do you have faith in God above ? if the bible tells you so . oh do you believe in rock and roll , can music save your mortal soul , and can you teach me how to dance real slow ? 
hm , well i just slept for twelve hours . i guess thats what i get for only sleeping four the night before ... 
happy 18th birthday to my bestest friend in the whole wide world , Stephie Sisson ! stephie , you are my friend , confidant , muse , the person i can turn to in any situation and laugh manically over a million inside jokes with . you are all grown up now , but i love that when we're together , we're little kids again <3<3<3 
grocery shopping and , theoretically/hopefully , getting some homework done today 
MUST . GET . STUFF . DONE . GAHHHH !!!! 
only four more days til st. < PROPFIRST>'s day ! ooohhh i can hardly wait ;D 
in the course of 6 pages of this book on Dogen , I have read the phrases \birth-and-death\ " and \ " life-and-death\ " 52 times . I'm only about 50% sure I understand the concept . this is what I get for doodling through my Japanese Philosophy lectures ... " 
my plan to go to sleep before midnight failed , and now there's an episode of the apprentice i haven't watched ?! no hope of sleeping now ( yes , i fully accept i'm probably the last person whose still watching that show ) . 
realized i'm behind a month and a half typing up notes . aaaand the fun begins ! 
just go ahead and hate on me and run your mouth , so everyone can hear . hit me with the words you got and knock me down . baby , i don't care , i'm tunin ' up to fade you out . you wanna be , a loser like me ! 
best thing to see on your walk home : a little dog walking proudly with a tennis ball in it's mouth . worst thing to see on your walk home : a very pregnant woman smoking outside a church . ohh the extremes of life 
HAPPY SAINT PATRICK'S DAY FROM CORK CITY , IRELAND ! feeling rather authentic today ;) have a Happy < PROPFEMALE>'s Day everyone , cheers ! 
time for relatively low-key st. < PROPFEMALE>'s day partay ! ;) 
had a great st. < PROPFIRST>'s day , and am glad i'm functioning a lot better now than most of the rest of the population here 
today : type up notes from < PROPMALE > Imperial History , take down notes from book on < PROPFEMALE > . tomorrow : type up notes from Japanese Philosophy and < PROPMALE > tic Lit , take down notes from books for Japanese paper . sunday : go to library to study books in open reserve , create outline for < PROPMALE > and Japanese papers . GOGOGO ! 
really missing home , and already missing ireland . gahh conflicting emotions ! 
typing up notes and take down notes from library books today , lunch break of course though for < PROPMALE>'s Tea Market on St. < PROPFIRST>'s Street ! 
if you only look to your past , your past becomes you . 
listening to 103.7 KISS FM while doing homework not only makes note taking/transcribing more enjoyable , but also makes me feel like I'm home in Milwaukee again :) 
tickle in my throat has turned into a cough and my voice sounding like shit . bring on the zinc supplements and orange juice ! WORK FAST , PLEASE . 
off to open reserve at the library with < PROPFEMALE > Alley , then paper outlines , then The Start tonight ? not a bad day if I do say so myself ;) 
found a detailed family tree of the Julio-Claudian dynasty ! my nerdiness just increased ten-fold , I'm pretty damn sure . 
love that the title , thesis , and basis of my Japanese Philosophy final essay is dependent on my understanding of a concept that I can only marginally grasp . let the BS begin ! 
you know how lazy I am ? I'm so lazy that I haven't even been keeping up with the fake journal entries for the zazen sittings I'm haven't been doing . this is either a testament to my genius or to my stupidity . 
... i should really sleep , but sleeping means waking up , and waking up means I will inevitably need to do more work , and work makes me sleepy , thus why i should really sleep ... 
saw a half smashed wine bottle outside of my class today . I think someone tried to < PROPFEMALE > the Connolly Building 
positive : just finished a rockin ' intro paragraph for my < PROPMALE > History paper . negative : my neck and upper back are killing me . I want a < PROPFIRST > on the back and a massage at the same time . 
going to the climbing wall tonight for the first time in ... well ... damn , this will be an interesting night . 
oh what a beautiful morning , oh what a beautiful day . i've got a beautiful feeling , everything's going my way :) 
\your never too old to have a happy childhood . \ " wise words :) " 
* sigh * need to get at least one paragraph of a paper done today , then < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE>'s tonight :) 
\they're turning kids into slaves just to make cheaper sneakers . but what is the real cost ? ' cause the sneakers don't seem that much cheaper . why are we still paying so much for sneakers ? when you've got them made by little slave kids . what are your overheads ? \"" 
slept like a baby last night , woke up as happy as can be :) 
need to make < PROPMALE > progress this weekend on my essays . coffee , chocolate , and tea galore ! 
i love my sexy bitches : < PROPFEMALE > Jacobson , < PROPFEMALE > Alley , and < PROPFEMALE > O'Shea . i love our * ehem * revealing conversations , random movie nights , inability to do homework together , and chocolate obsessions . but most of all , i love their bodies <3
