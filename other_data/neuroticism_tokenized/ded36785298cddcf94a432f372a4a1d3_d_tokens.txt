... Rest in Peace , < PROPMALE > Hochstedler . Prayers to his family . <3 
spent the first hour of my day in near-panic , thinking that I had suffered a concussion or stroke because I was completely unable to see clearly even though I had my glasses on ... 60 minutes later , I realized that I was wearing both my glasses AND my contacts . I should have known then that this day was headed towards despair ! ;) 
thinks \you wear more vests than the cast of Blossom ! \ " Hahahaha ! " 
... Busy day leading into a busy evening : Class , Court , Lunch , Therapy , 3 Home Visits ! Ready for bed ... 
... Tomorrow is Friday ! Yay ! <3 
... I don't usually do these re-posts , but I really liked this one : If you have a husband who is your best friend , who works hard to provide for your family , who has been there through thick & thin , who has been a blessing in your life and to whom you are proud to be married to , copy & paste this in your status with your wedding date : May 22 , 2004 . <3

... Alright , I'll admit that I am totally anti-Santa ; however , tonight's GLEE made me hate \Old < PROPFIRST > Kringle\ " a little less ! <3 " 
... I am so proud of my best friends , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > ! What troopers throughout the long arrival of their son .

Kiddos were to be at a visit , I was suppose to be helping in < PROPFIRST>'s classroom for the first time this school year , and we all have a meeting this afternoon -- And yet , I am at home along with four restless children because my car will not start . And so , I ask again : Really , Monday ??! Seriously . 
wants to bake something today ... 
... I know I'm up later than I should be when I've seen the Pajama Jeans commercial more than three times . 
... Now , I know I must go to bed as I just considered whether or not previously-referenced Pajama Pants were really that terrible an idea . Signing off before I order a pair ! Goodnight ! 
... Well , poor < PROPFIRST > got one of his wisdom teeth extracted , another filled , and a deep cleaning with antibiotic injections to top it all off ! To make matters even better for him , we HAVE to go Christmas shopping tonight . I feel bad for him , although I am looking forward to him being a bit loopy after he takes his pain meds ! <3
