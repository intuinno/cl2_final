I mean its like the body's animated even with substantial blood loss and using full strength of what a person can do ( under fight-or-flight conditions anyways ) . What keeps the body moving and wouldn't the lack of ability to heal since the body is technically \ " dead\ " cause some issues for the zombie ? "

After playing Vindictus again , I got bored cause I have to do all the stuff I did in closed beta all over again . 
GUYS GUYS GUYS GUYS GUYS ! .... Ducks 
You shouldn't have done that .... 
This is ridiculous . Trying to get this Wusb11 v 2.5 wireless adapater to work and when it doesn't pick up a signal , XP gives me some crap like its not installed properly . Otherwise , when I do get it in just the right spot to start working , it doesn't connect to ANY signal ( encrypted or not ) . Any suggestions NOT INVOLVING BUYING A NEW ONE ? 
CAN'T WAIT TILL NEXT SUNDAY ! 
my hands are feeling pretty sensitive right now ... anyone else ? 
Interesting how a lot of people KNOW a SECRET organization . 
A provoking thought : Why does this world have to have so much boundaries and divisions ? What makes people deem them so necessary to isolate themselves from one another ; a group from another ; a family from each other ? Are we really all so different from each other or do we choose to think that way to the point that division is necessary ? 
Something about the low static sound from an old record playing makes me feel at ease . Probably because it reminds me of the times I used to sit out on the porch during light rainfall at my grandma's house back in Hawaii . 
testing the BRENIZER METHOD RAAAAAAAAAAAH . photo coming soon 
Did not know Photoshop could eat as much power as it is doing so now . 
Really late update . Conditioning at 12:30 pm today at breeze , that is all .

holy shit . i just had a dream twice about sealing away some lady who escaped from hell and in order to open a portal , we needed to have another soul enter . this guy volunteered since it was the only way to get rid of the lady and when the portal opened it sucked the lady in and the guy was supposed to go next and woke up thunder and lightning soon as it was his turn . 
Put this on your status if you know or love someone who is gay . My wish is that people will understand that being gay is not a disease nor a choice- people who are gay are not looking for a cure but ACCEPTANCE andEQUAL RIGHTS . 93% won't copy and paste this . Will you make it your status ... for at least one hour ? Promote LOVE & Acceptance ! NOT hate !!!

so awesome day of training , a lot of isometric workouts which were killer . after telila took me and < PROPFIRST > to < PROPFEMALE > thai near < PROPFEMALE > town for some food , good stuff there . 
lychee and haupia in one week ? DAS CRAZY ! i wonder what's the next nostalgia food i'll find 
i'm not sore anymore , which is great , but my body feels very tired . 
two interesting things happened today . 1 ) i found a cart near the outside break area with a bunch of records in em , all really old concert music . i took home an album called \at the piano\ " by < PROPFIRST > carle . " 
shiiiiit , it got pretty cold fast for mornings .... welp back to sleep for a few hours :D 
might be a bit late 
\All the lonely people 
Having lunch at sams club . Good sized pizza with a large drink for under $3 . AND i get to say hi to mr awesome ! 
... And Halloween begins WITH ME GETTING SOME SLEEP , NIGHT . Also conditioning at 12pm , Desert Breeze . 
should i shave now and start noshavember on the first or just keep growing from what i have ? 
\Ferghus's < PROPMALE > name is the Weapon Breaker . You have been warned . \ " LOL GOOD ONE ! " 
I am sleepy and I'm only half way through work 
just tried a red bull today , not too bad but there's a slight taste in the end i'm not too fond of . 
and today begins probably the longest weekend i'll experience for this year . \ 
friday work 12pm - 9pm\ 
saturday work 2pm - 11pm\ 
sunday 9am-12pm training , work 2pm - 11pm\ 
monday work 2pm - 11pm\ 
I GOT THIS ! 
I just saw a little girl walk in with her grandma and the grandma had natural blonde hair with dyed pink on top and lime green side burn area . Win 
Working 2pm-11pm is kinda nice since I basically get the dying portion of the day , but that also means I have to do closing time clean up . 
Today was such a downhill day . Tired when i woke up , cold when i went to work , irritated by the people i have to work with and work around . Came home late after seeing my Thanksgiving week schedule , which is gonna be hell ( worth the pay though ) , just to find that < PROPFIRST > Dufort died . I didn't know him too well but i really liked him . 
waka waka waka , day off WHOO 
arg , minecraft so addicting 
i just started watching the world only god knows and immediately i see that the opening is probably done by the same person who made the higashi no < PROPFEMALE > opening . \

If you were to return to a place you were familiar with just to find completely new faces and styles , would you be able to call that a place to return to ? Would you be willing to go there ? 
Person : Hey can you check this for me ? * is free*\ 
You : ... Can't you do it yourself ? * is busy*\ 
Person : Ok . \ 
Don't you hate when people do that to you ?

Just saw a truck with \Id rather be cumming than stroking . \ " on the back window " 
is listening to the sounds from the album \Toonami Black Hole Megamix\ " which is the tracks from Toonami's commercials and events along with voice samples from various shows they put ( the old school ones with < PROPMALE > 1 and 2 ) mixed together by DJ Clarknova " 
That < PROPFEMALE > ringing jingling dinging for the salvation army is driving me nuts 
warm food and hot chocolate to start the day . 7 to 4 shift plus payday today 
So cold outside and im about to go back work for another 4 hours 
anyone remember WAAAAAAAAAAAAAY back when toonami wasn't hosted by TOM1 and < PROPFEMALE > ? the spaceship wasn't the Absolution ? Moltar was the original host and the ship was this < PROPFEMALE > UFO thing lol 
Woooo ! Free thanksgiving food for lunch and only 3 hours left till i head home 
and the count down to black friday begins .... 
Headed out to work . Wish me luck on not getting trampled lol 
Black Friday is stupidly busy here . I didnt have to work inside or do < PROPFEMALE > outs so i got dodge majority of the rush 
I SURVIVED BLACK FRIDAY 
Work is going by oddly fast today . Just the only problem is my stomach 
I got home at 6 yesterday feeling like crap from all the stomach issues and muscle weakness , woke up this morning at 7am . 
conditoning time , call me if you need me 
Free glasses repair , free pizza for lunch , free water like usual all at the cost of having an oddly longish day at work . Not a bad trade at all 
HEY EVERYONE THAT HAS AN IRL FACE , CHANGE IT TO A CARTOON OF YOUR CHILDHOOD TO SUPPORT THE FIGHT AGAINST CHILD ABUSE !
