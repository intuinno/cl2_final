There's a picture opposite me of my primitive ancestry which stood on < PROPMALE > shores and kept the beaches shipwreck free . 
Rudies All Around ! 
So what ? Who cares ? We're doin ' it how we like . I'm singing into my mic . My special underwater mic !

Those fuckers still haven't given me my check . Somebody come make me breakfast . 
The folk show was awesome . But it was in an old person home . Not kidding . We get to the place , and there's a bunch of old ladies just watering flowers in the front yard . You would have never expected there to be a badass concert going on inside . 
The stars fell out of Heaven , the < PROPFEMALE > could not be found . The sun was in a million pieces scattered all around . 
Trolling ! 
D&D is extra intense tonight ! 
Last night , I met my brother in a dream for the first time since he died . And we laughed , and we laughed , and we laughed . 
Somebody's hauling some serious ass on a motorcycle up and down my street . 
I'm not a cool guy anymore , as if I ever was before . 
I just deleted all of the Supervillains albums off of my computer . Fuck yeah . 
People just have to say beautiful words to me and I'll probably write a song about it . This dude just came up to my house and said he was selling fruit from the valley . And it was tasty . 
I busted a fat munch with < PROPMALE > Bearden at the Taste of < PROPFEMALE > today . Now I've got the itis . 
Good ol ' fried egg < PROPFIRST > !
