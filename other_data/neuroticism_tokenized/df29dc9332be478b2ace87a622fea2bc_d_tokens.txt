Well it's 2011 and this is gonna be a great year ! Hasn't been so far but I have my beliefs about what will happen :D 

this ain't nothin ... - < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > . i totally adore that song . ily baby . goodnight everybody . 
i just don't know when to stop . . why can't i ever just shut up ? goodnight ppl . gotta get up in a while to go to work . joy . 
just got home from work . textin my love <3 :) bout to watch a movie n gettin off here . more work tomorrow . yay me :/ haha 
I'm tired , i don't feel good , and i miss you . Idk why we haven't talked but i love you . 
as if this night wasn't bad enough , i dropped my phone in water and it won't turn on . guess it don't matter much since nobody took the time to text me . but oh well . i'd love to see how this is gonna turn out . :/ 
my phone is temporarily workin but only when its on the charger and i don't move it . it's pissing me off . and YOU , well you're pissing me off more . maybe there is no reason to have a phone anymore . 
i hate what you've done to me . && i hate my stupid phone . i'm done . i give up . you win . 
ugh . today was okay , went swimming and then rented some movies . now i'm trying to figure out how to get a new phone , gonna cook dinner in a little while and watch tv . but none of it numbs the pain . 
just bought a new phone , no pictures or sounds . send me some , thanks . same number 615-946-3380 
i hate that i love you . my head hurts . my whole body hurts . i feel like i'm going through detox all over again , only without the drugs . :( 
going to work in a few hours . why does everything hurt so bad ? i wish my mom was still here . she would know what to do :( 
If love is a lie , then that makes you a liar . </3 
sometimes the only way to be strong is to say nothing . if i do , then i'm back in it and it will only be worse . my heart just can't take it . trying was just to hard for you . 
You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe When you with em you meet and neither one of you even know what hit em Got that warm fuzzy feeling Yeah them chills used to get em Now you're getting fuckin ' sick of lookin ' at em You swore you'd never hit em , never do nothin ' to hurt em Now you're in each other's face spewin ' venom in your words when you spit em ... - Eminem Love The Way You Lie 
got a long day today , but hopefully it won't be too bad . only 7 more months and i'll be fine . 
just taking it one day at a time . that's the only way i can do this . 
i still love you , and i will forever . we can't hide the truth , we know each other better . but when we try to make it work , we both end up hurt . it aint supposed to be that way . so baby baby stay . stay right where you are , i like this way . it's good for my heart . i haven't felt like this , in God knows how long . i know everything's gonna be okay . if you just stay gone . -- Stay Gone by < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > <3

off to work . less than ONE week . super hype .
