There's no such thing as over-achievers and under-achievers . There is just achieving . If you fail at something you can't \not achieve\ " it . You achieved something else instead . " 
Has anyone ever cared about someone but avoided said person because you thought it would hurt him/her more ? I have ... But how could checking in hurt someone ? Is it hurting another that's concerning , or the fear of myself being hurt , afraid of my feelings being rejected ? It makes me feel foolish , like I've been caught . But why do I feel foolish about caring for someone ? 
When you have sex , you will get pregnant , then die !
