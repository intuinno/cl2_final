\We live on front porches and swing life away We get by just fine here on minimum wage If love is a labor I'll slave til the end I won't cross these streets until you hold my hand . \"" 

... rest in peace Aeris ... and now six of you know what happened to the last week of my life ! 
CHEETAH !!!!! 
1000 < PROPMALE > away , there's nothing left to say , but so much left that I don't know . We never had a choice . This world is too much noise . It takes me under . It takes me under once again . 
If the question of what it all means doesn't mean anything , why do I keep coming back to it ? 
Smiley face 
Sing like you think no one's listening ... 
Isn't sure why he's still awake

Wins at bomberman forever ! 
HD vision sunglasses .... Real thing ... not kidding ... WHY !!! 
Is it just me or is all of college just confetti and high fives ? 
What's that mean ?

At least it's not really late

These are not the hammer 
\I love how we're all one big fail fest\ " ... Thanks < PROPFIRST >..." 
... They say the Nile used to run ... from east to west 
A(G_64 , G_64 ) Tremble in fear ... tremble 
You see it's funny cause I'm not asleep 
will be going back to Cincinnati , but will miss < PROPFIRST > Pomerleau , because he is my favorite person and he won't be 2 floors away . Oh how i love him ! He brings me smilies . :D ... oh and he is so attractive and smart ! yay < PROPFIRST > Pomerleau because he is so swimingly splendid ! 
Everything was beautiful , and nothing hurt 
We're oft to blame , and this is too much proved , that with devotion's visage and pious action we do sugar on the devil himself . 
An Astronomer's Lament ... 
... Save that , of knowing that I do Your will ... 
<3 < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Pomerleau < PROPFIRST > Evans < PROPFIRST > Lovett < PROPFEMALE > Jacobs :D yay friends !

I'm confused ... game 11 didn't begin with 1 . d4 ... Something must have gone horribly wrong 
\If love was a labor I'd slave ' till the end \"" 
Trix are for kids 
... indeed 
Am I the only one who feels like it's been way too long since I've done any calculus ? 
why does < PROPFEMALE > need to check the list twice if he's magic and sees everything ? 
I wanna be the guy 
Sorry , the diagram was upside down 
1 week from now I'll be at slu 
College tomorrow . so I pack tomorrow right ? 
... If Pikachu's a hooker . 
< PROPFIRST > Pomerleau owns my soul forever and ever because he rocks ! 
is the best ever ! 
A combination of allergies , lack of sleep , and poor diet has left me in a half stupor all day ... to put succinctly : College . 
... and thus , it begins . 
Thank you everyone for your birthday wishes ... I'd just like to announce to all my friends I'm older than : Since I am no longer a teenager ... you can assume I spend my days walking around town in a monocle and top-hat using fancy words like \verily\ " and \ " thy\ " and do old person things like taxes and meddling in the lives of the young . That is all . " 
i wish i was as smart or cool as < PROPFIRST > Pomerleau ! 
One does not simply Zerg rush into Mordor . 
wishes i was cool enough to be a wizard ! 
I freaking hate sleep . 
\Never pet a burning dog . \ " Thanks day9 ... thanks " 
You know what sucks ? Sleep . . 
Chimneys are the best thing ever , don't you agree ? If you agree , write on my wall how much you love Chimneys . :D \ 
~ Love your good friend , < PROPFIRST > Pomerleau 
So ... I guess I'm gonna have to get used to never sleeping again . 
\Every girl I dated in middle school has a kid now . \ " <3 < PROPFIRST > Kean <3 " 
I'd like to take this opportunity to thank < PROPFIRST > Pomerleau and < PROPFIRST > Kean for being so nice to my computer while i take out the trash . 
Of course ' Baneling ' isn't the answer ... ' Baneling ' is the question . The answer is ' yes . '
