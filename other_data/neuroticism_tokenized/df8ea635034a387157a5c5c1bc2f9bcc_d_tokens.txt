Thinking of annoying the sleepy Kris-moster with pounces and tickles

Seafood city is like the stores in chinatown , only i can read most of the lables now . Big , but not as big 
Why does cleaning the house make one sooooo dirty ? Do I look like a dust magnet ?

Almost off work ... woot ! 
I'll be honest and petty . I really hate it when I work < PROPFEMALE > hard and save money to try and get something i really want , and when I show someone else , they go and ask their parents to get it for them ........ and get it before I do . 
the world spites me today ... random 1-800 < PROPFIRST > and people asking for fernades having been calling me since 6 this morning ... 
I'm not sure what to do with my life .... and it's only Wednesday .... * sigh *

You can ask me three questions ( privately in my inbox ) and i will answer truthfully , but i dare you to copy this and see what you get asked ... 
Does anyone ever notice how people in movies and tv shows always get their mail in the morning at like 7 am ? Right before they shower but always after coffee ? \ 
But this never happens in real life . I never get my mail right after my morning tea or hot choco ...... >.> Maybe switching to coffee will fix it ? 
Don't worry . If you kick one < PROPFEMALE > , then all the rest will scatter . 
I hate showers ..... They lul you into a false sense of security with that wonderus warm water . And they freeze you to death when you try to dry off . 
Don't hold me up now , \ 
I can stand my own ground , \ 
I don't need your help now , \ 
You won't let me down , down , down ! 
* Gnaws on interwebs *
