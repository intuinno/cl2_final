my phone is totally screwed up . It does this every new year and last awhile ... I'm really annoyed . I've been on hold with the company for a long time . =| 

Facebook is < PROPFEMALE > stupid . I want to break every computer it the world cause favebook is dumb =P 
oh no , i meant facebook . 
I need coffee ... TOO TIRED !!!!! 
goodnight . I guess I'm the only one up this late lol . Not really tired , just bored . 
is going to < PROPFEMALE>'s going away party tonight ... & helping her pack the rest of her stuff . 
tired and hungry ! 
took a nap . =) .... very sad my best friend leaves on Wed .... =( 
tired . ready for bed soon . 
Finally got the pup to sleep =) he had his first shots today so he's worn out . I decided to go with my first thought and name him < PROPMALE > . I think its cute on him . So now my babies are Peyton , < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE > ... He hasn't met his 2 < PROPFEMALE > sisters yet .. I'm dreading it , kinda scared lol . 
oh and scared for me and the puppy , not the cats ... lol . They are some meannnn < PROPFEMALE>'s . Good thing I love them . 
Peyton , < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE > had their first meeting tonight ... It went actually sooo good on Peyton's part ( for her ) . I brought him in my room and held him and < PROPFEMALE > right away hissed and ran under the bed . Peyton sat there seriously glaring but didn't hiss or growl and she responded to me petting her ! SO HAPPY ! it's still gonna be awhile till I can have him in my room but I'm so proud of Peyt ! 
I just decided to go with Bongo . The name suits him , I think , and I've been accidentally calling him it anyway ! 
everyone please pray for my friend < PROPFEMALE>'s puppy . She's the sister of my puppy and she's very sick . They think it may be parvo , or worms but please keep her in your prayers . 
got to sleep in till 8:30 ! so happy ! 
i hate essays . i hate english . I'd rather do math for hours and hours than write one stupid essay !!!!!!! okay i feel better . 
going to bed . goodnight everyone . 
All of these deaths are so sad and so scary . R.I.P to all of them . It's starting to make me really see that life is so short . And especially R.I.P < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > . What is going on around here ? 
I don't care ! ! plain and simple . 
I'm going to be happy anyway . =) even when people suck .

If you are reading this , whether we do or don't speak often , post a comment of your first memory of you and me . when you have finished , post this paragraph on your own status ; you'll be surprised what people remember about you . 
I have so much work to do !!! I hate it ! 
boreeeddd . Someone talk to me ! 
It seems the ones who hate betrayal are the ones who are the betrayers . It seems the ones who hate the liars , tell the worst lies . Funny how that is so true . It works that way with almost everything . 
1 Corinthians 13:4 -8 – “Love is patient , love is kind . It does not envy , it does not boast , it is not proud . It is not rude , it is not self-seeking , it is not easily angered , it keeps no records of wrongs . Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth . It always protects , always trusts , always hopes , always perseveres . Love never fails . ” =) 
=) =) =) =) =) =) =) =) =) =) =) =) =) =)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))

Life is too short to wake up with regrets . ? So love the people who treat you right . ? Forget about the one's who don't . ? Believe everything happens for a reason . If you get a second < PROPMALE > , grab it with both hands . If it changes your life , let it . Nobody said life would be easy , they just promised it would be worth it . Post to your wall if you agree . 
I have come to the conclusion I have a very boring life . Yep . I need to do something about it but I just don't .

I feel like crap . I just got home and hardly made it into my bed ... I can't stand this !!! 
this is not my weekend ... 
I've realized that sometimes things happen that can't be explained ... Maybe there is a reason but maybe there isn't . If there is it'll eventually be clear , if not than it was probably your own desperation begging for reason in a situation you created in your mind . Or maybe your looking for a reason to excuse your behavior ... rather thats lack of doing anything about it or handeling it all wrong . 
now .. i can clearly see that your just a figment of my imagination . I created you so i can also destroy you . =) 
I can't believe it's already may !!!! Next month is my birthday =) 
Do not hit the video I just posted . I don't know what it is but if you do remove it from your account/app setting . 
raWr !!! 
everytime i'm around my nephews and niece i get some kids cartoon song obnoxiously stuck in my head lol . 
< PROPFEMALE > if you won the lottery what's the first thing you'd do ? 
Idk ... .. 
finals are soon ..... Day off tomorrow ... study time !!! 
happy all the time !! 
& the very words that bind me will never escape my lips . Haunted , but living a lie . <3 
Should you do something you'll know you'll regret if you don't ? Even if its something that scares the life out of you ? Or should you just live with the regret and not face the fear ? and hope the regret will pass ? 
my face hurts !! =( 
finals today ....... I'm scared lol . I spent a lot of time studying tho so i should be okay .. Last day of school for the summer . =) 
i wish i was at ambers =( !!!! 
(= ( 
what a crappy day . My head hurts and i'm exhausted . Goodnight everyone . 
let me fill you in on MOST people . Don't bother giving a damn about them because when it comes down to it , the only person they give a damn about is themselves . Harsh ? Reality hurts . 
finally my babies were born ! =) Satania had 4 kittens , all grey and white lol . She's solid black so i'm very surprised she didn't have an black ones . 
went to see a movie tonight at the theaters and had to leave in the middle of it cause I was in so much pain from my mouth ... I think it might be my wisdom teeth . I came back to the theater but it was like 2 mins from being over =( wasted 14 bucks on a ticket for 3d .. the pain was HORRIBLE though . =( I gotta go to the denist soon before I shoot myself . 
work tonight . 
Tired tired tired !! Closed tonight ... I hate closing . I try my best and i still suck . =( lol . I guess it just takes some getting use to and getting a rhythm down . Anyway going to bed . day off tomorrow ! =) 
Omg i'm never gonna be able to sleep . The pain in my jaw is killing me !!!!! =( the only thing that makes it feel even a little better is a hot rag pressed against it and the sec i let go the pain comes all back . I can't handle this anymore !!! Fml . 
I wasted my whole day sleeping and laying around cause i'm in so much pain . This SUCKS . Calling the dentist tomorrow .... Don't care how much it costs or how terrified i am of needles ... I can't sleep , i can't eat .. Can't even focus . And its getting worse ... FML . 
i got an appt ... I really am hoping they remove it today . I'm on my way there now . 
< PROPFEMALE > tired . 
damn ... Don't think i've ever felt so tired in my life ... Panic attacks can really drain you =/ i took an hour nap ( on accident ) earlier and i'm still exhausted ... I close tomorrow now so at least i'll be able to sleep in . 
finally watched a semi good movie tonight .. All the ones i've been renting have been crap ! 
i waited like a week for my laptop to be fixed .. They replaced the hardrive and somehow forgot the wireless driver so it can't even get online . -.- now i gotta take it all the way back and if they tell me i gotta wait another week i'm gonna be pissed . 
i am so exhausted ... I woke up every 2 hours with bad pain ... It went away for a few days and came back . Sad for life . and the medicine is making me feel seriously loopy . Oh well after wed this is all over . Thank god !!!! 
this whole day has been terrible . =( 
wow . Work is super slow !!!!!! This night is gonna drag on lol . and i'm closing now so i'm here till 1 !!

I am so dizzy I can't even see straight .... WTF . 
I have a weird feeling . Not necessarily bad , just weird . 
Hiding from the laughter in the closets of our lives . But the door hinges are squeaking letting in thin shards of light . And now a hand's extending outward , quiet comfort they invite . Do we dare take what they offer ? Do we step into the light ? When I die will they remember not what I did , but what I haven't done ? It's not the end that I fear with each breath , it's life that scares me to death . 
so I'm considering going vegan .. I don't know yet but it's just a thought . The meat industry is so gross .. After I learned more about that , I'm sickened by most meat . Then again , most processed food is pretty gross so Idk !!

The day one of them makes a bad assumption about me is the day i will worry and evaluate my self worth .

Hi , my name is Alexina . 
I feel so bad ! My dog hates little kids and my niece and nephews are down ... Well < PROPFIRST > is 9 , so Bongo doesn't mind him in my room but < PROPFIRST > is 4 so my dog doesn't like him ... and I feel so bad because < PROPFIRST > is able to come in here and Xander can't =( And he is crying over it =( 
Men confuse me . = X 
I guess where we lack power we will find it somewhere else . But maybe the real solution is to fight for the power that is keeping us under . 
i <3 the sound of the rain at night !!

I believe in Jesus Christ . One facebooker has challenged all believers \ 
to put this on their wall . In the Bible it says ... If you deny me in \ 
front of your peers , I will deny you in front of my Father at The Gates\ 
of Heaven . This is a simple test . If you love God and you are not \ 
afraid to show it , repost this . \

Does anyone go to anytime fitness and need a gym partner ? I hate going alone !! But I REALLY need to go !! 
I wish the animals would clean my room ... They are the ones who make the messes , little brats . But I guess that's what happens when you have 3 cats and a dog in one room ... heh . (= Oh well I love them anyway . I swear , it's like having kids !! The mess never ends , someone is always not getting along , they are demanding and hyper and like to get into stuff ... I think I should be well prepared when I have kids haha .

\Now I can deck the halls without wrecking my walls !!! \ " .... infomercials are so addicting ... haha . and lame .... = X " 
the things ive learned in school really help me out in arguments ... guess its useful after all .. haha . 
Minus a few setbacks and flaws , I'm pretty proud of the woman I've become . I realize that every experience , even the negative has only better my understanding of myself and others . Never would have said or believed that even 3 years ago .

So everyone just needs to calm down before I literally go crazy . = X 
The one U just called fat ? She has been starving herself & she has lost over 30lbs . The one U just called stupid ? She has a learning disability & studies over 4hrs a night . The one U just called ugly ? She spends hours putting makeup on hoping people will like her . The one U just tripped ? She is abused enough at home . There's a lot more to people than you think . Put this as your status if you're against bullying
