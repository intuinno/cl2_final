I just looked at CNN ... what the heck is wrong with people ? A guy in < PROPFEMALE > goes on a rampage on bunnies ? Seriously ? Bunnies ? I'd love to have a few minutes in a room , uninterrupted with the guy who did this ... specifically with him tied down and myself a baseball bat in my hands ... 
True Blood ... new season ... tonight ... SO EXCITED !!!! 
True Blood is the fastest hour on TV ... too fast ... 
Vampires , Werewolves and Werepanthers ... OH MY !!!!!! 
< PROPFEMALE > deserved the < PROPFIRST > she won for Precious ... her performance was sickening and heart wrenching at the same time . 
< PROPMALE > and Vienna are no more ... I'm in an absolute state of shock ! 
You know you're in the South when you are referred to as \sweetheart\ " by everyone ! " 
Liking the new changes with IPhone 4 !!! 
Okay ... TB .. maybe a little much ? That was not something I've seen before ...

Sitting < PROPFEMALE > the front row ... waiting for the show to start at Second City ! Crazy to be in the same place as so many of the greats !! 
If you grew up on the 80's and you're in Chicago you have to check out \The Best Friggin ' Time Of Your Life ! \ " HYSTERICAL !!! " 
So as we are leaving Second City we happened to see Mr. Michaels ... as in Lorne Michaels from SNL !!! 
Headed to Tattoo Factory for a new tat !! 
SALT ... um ... not so much ... 
Waiting to board ... already listening to a screamer ... not even on the plane yet and we're screaming ... fantastic !! 
Are there any people who are polite on planes anymore ... yeah I thought not ! 
Oh whoas me ' ... why does True Blood have to end so soon ? And why is < PROPFIRST > so dang sexy ?!!! 
I hate being at the airport before the airline opens ... it's to freakin ' early ! 
I'm wondering why ... if the security threat level is \orange\ " and I'm supposed to be at the airport two hours ahead ... why are the airlines not open ? Things that make you go ... hmmmm ... " 
So we arrive in Atlanta about 5 minutes ahead of schedule ... but we've been sitting on the Tarmac waiting for a gate for 15 ... we are in \A\ " and I have about 20 minutes to get to \ " C ... \ " bets anyone ? " 
Did I have any takers ??? Cause I missed my flight by 5 minutes ! 
Sometimes Mom knows just what to say ! 
I love it ... \host to a guest leaving ... \ " well how was everything ? Are you full ? \ " . Response \ " well I'm full ... but it wasn't good . \ " . Well how are you full ? " 
Been a long couple of weeks ... it's good to be home ' 
So proud of < PROPFIRST > Miller ! I'm so glad he chose not to return to LA INK ! 
I'm wondering why my mom - who doesn't have a FB account - would 1 ) open an email from someone she doesn't know asking her to be friends and 2 ) proceed to forward said email to me ? Uh can we say virus ? Scam ? Thanks mom ! 
Why do people choose to blow their noses while seated in the dining room of a restaurant ? Oh and the proceed to leave the gross napkins on the table ? DISGUSTING ! 
First full day of new braces ... OMG ... what was I thinking ? 
Probably going off the norm but I really enjoyed the True Blood finale ! Yeah went off the books ... but there too many plot fragments to follow the books . Can't wait for season 4 !!! 
Man ... I finally figured out why something wasn't working at work ... yahoooo !!!! 
So why when it's 11PM or better 7:30 AM ... do people let there hotel doors slam ? I mean really ... a little courtesy ? Oh but wait ... what's that ? 
So I'm at O'Hare looking at a sign by United saying they have the most on time flights ... hmmmm ... do you think this accounts for the time we land and have to sit on the Tarmac ? 
CSI ... a shark in the pool ? Really ? Reaching ... no ... I would say stretching ! 
So do you think maybe when you're coughing in a public location you should cover your mouth ? I'm just thinking ... 
I'm not good with Helpdesk calls at 4:30 AM ... 
My Mom and I need to get active and live in a small apt ... thinking about the Wi ... thoughts ? 
Please put this on your status if you know or love someone who is gay . \ 
My wish is that people will understand that being gay is not a disease \ 
or a choice . People who are gay are not looking for a cure , they are \ 
looking for ACCEPTANCE and EQUAL RIGHTS . 93% won't copy and paste this . \ 
Promote Love & Acceptance ! NOT hate ! 
Gretchen ... are you FREAKING kidding me ? Since when is jersey knit , unimaginative and uninspired high fashion ? UGH !!!!!!!!!!! 
Sorry for the post - don't do it - it's stupid ! 
JUST NOT < PROPFEMALE > !! Please not < PROPFEMALE > !!! 
I REFUSE to watch Project Runway next season ... I am disgusted in their choice ! I'd I wanted to wear my grandmother's clothes - I certainly wouldn't pay for them ! 
I am sick ! I refuse to watch Project Runway again . Who wears granny panties for fashion ? 
Just forced the \brave hunter\ " to spit out a bird before he brought it into the house ... he was super ticked when it flew away ! " 
Just ordered a new Wii !!!!!! 
Am I the only person in < PROPFEMALE > that thinks < PROPFIRST > Swift really can't sing ? She sounds great ... on her CD's ... and then I hear her live ... 
So even though I'm guilty of watching ... $60K for a 2 year old's birthday party ? Seriously - that's a college education . SAD ... DISGUSTING !!! 
Paranormal Activity 2 ... interesting ... still atmospheric and shocking in places ... but a clever plot - gotta give it that ! 
Just found out my debit card was compromised ... someone in Madrid tried to buy a plane ticket to Hungary ... now I have to go a week without a debit card .... who carries cash ? 
My butt is so sore from using the Wii ... guess maybe it's working ? 
My Mom just asked me about creating a < PROPFEMALE > on Faceback ... 
Duran Duran ... February 2011 and a TOUR !!! Can't wait ! 
What the F**K happened ? 
Jake ... Taylor Swift ... REALLY ? UGH ! 
Santa ... all I want for Christmas is to stop hearing \Hey Soul Sister \"" 
So ... we live in Chicago ... and my Mom just asked me what team < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > played for ? 
OMG !!! Zac and < PROPFEMALE > have split ... I SO DIDN'T SEE THAT ONE COMING !!! 
I wanna go to The < PROPMALE > Hotel and attend the Paranormal Activity Live conference in March ... who's coming with me ??? 
OMG ... first < PROPFIRST > C Hall and < PROPFEMALE > Carpenter ... then Zac and < PROPFEMALE > and now < PROPFIRST > and Scarlett ... what is going on ? 
So ... if Criminal Minds got rid of AJ Cook ... why bother adding a new blonde agent ? Kinda pointless ? 
Criminal Minds is reminiscent of the case of < PROPFIRST > MacDonald ... 
Bridalplasty ... confer and discuss ... 
dream gods ... please no nightmares tonight ! 
Can't wait for tomorrow !!! Going to see Wicked ! 
Wicked ! 4 < PROPFEMALE > Review here in Chicago ! Can't wait until tomorrow ! And a bonus lunch with < PROPMALE > !!!!!

Wicked was AWESOME !!! 
Go Fabio !!!! 
The jury FINALLY got it right !!!! 
Just put \chains\ " on the bottom braces to pull in the spaces ... I'm inflicting this pain upon myself ... why ? " 
< PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > are done ... BUMMER ! Hey < PROPMALE > ... I can put on a blond wig ... just keep that in mind ! 
I really hate when other people take all the credit ! 
I'm not VERY superstitious , but this year July has 5 Fridays , 5 Saturdays and 5 Sundays . This happens once every 823 years . This is called money bags . So : copy this to your status and money will arrive within 4 days ... based on Chinese Feng Shui . The one who does not copy will be without money . I can't let that person be ME ! What the heck- it can't hurt . LOL 
Watching < PROPMALE > Hill ... laughing my arse off !!!! 
McDonald's new Oatmeal ... gotta say I'm lovin ' it ! 
So although it's busy ... but not outrageous ... so why do people have to sit right next to me ? I mean it's not like there aren't other seats ... but NO ... gotta sit right next to me ! 
If you didn't see it ( or want to laugh again ) check out the SNL skit w/ Pee Wee Hermann and < PROPMALE > Samberg on You Tube ... hilarious ! 
Why on earth , when you break your little toe , does it hurt so damn much ? 
Enjoying my day off ... chilling at Denny's ... oh but wait ... what's that sound ? A shrieking child whose Dad thinks it's hilarious ... WTF ... are you kidding me ? 
Thank you EVERYONE for all the Birthday wishes ! 
Was anyone else let down with Oprah's big secret ? She has a half sister ... wow ... 
It's the Stay Puft Marshmellow Man ... 
Possibly 20 inches ... UGH !!! 
Watching E ! Red Carpet show before The Grammy's ... not sure why < PROPFIRST > Seacrest would choose to interview < PROPFIRST > & < PROPMALE > Kardashian and let < PROPFEMALE > Lauper walk by ... I mean it is The Grammy's right ? 
I love when my cat sleeps in my lap and dreams ... he kicks his feet ... it's adorable ! 
< PROPFEMALE > 
Bought my cat a harness so he can go outside this summer ... this should be interesting ... 
Battle : Los Angeles ... Red Riding Hood ... True Grit ... is there an original film out there ? Something we haven't see over and over again or that's a remake ? 
Plus size retailers ... why do you use non-plus size models ? I don't get it ... 
Comcast sucks ... I'm a loyal customer ... but in order to save any money I basically need to stop my service and restart to get a \deal\ " on a package ! " 
Does anyone really care that < PROPFEMALE > Anniston cut her hair ? 
Off to The < PROPMALE > hotel for the weekend ... 
Pizza ... the breakfast if champions ... I couldn't find any little chocolate donuts ! 
Flight delayed 2 hours ... not a cloud in the sky ... really SW ? WTF ! 
Momism time ... a friend of mine is going to Mexico tomorrow ... mind you we live in Chicago ... and she just asked how they were getting there ... you know they might be driving ! 
Finishing the Duran Duran unstaged LIVE performance - man I love these guys ! 
Another brilliant statement by mom ... she asked me today , when I went whale watching was I actually in the ocean or on a lake ? You heard me ... was I in a lake ? 
If you have to go to the hospital - for anything - don't let them give you anything to take home ... kidney stone \strainer\ " was $12 - are you serious ? I could have used a coffee filter and a colander ($1 - at the Dollar store ) ... no wonder healthcare costs force people to go w/o insurance . "
