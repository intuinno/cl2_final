People need to understand that special needs children don't have an illness , they are not looking for a cure only acceptance . 93% of you probably won't copy and paste this ~ will you be in the 7% that will and leave it on your status for at least an hour . Please support the Special Education week March 22nd to the 26th ..

Thank you everyone for all the lovely Birthday wishes !!! ^_^

Music is the gateway to a world where anything you can imagine is possible ... lucky for me I have a good imagination :P 
it's official .... i'm going to end up like the Phantom of the Opera .... all alone with my piano and my music to keep me company ... and knowing me i'll probably have the mask and the cape too ... 
practicing my kickboxing combo on the office copier .... why you ask ? because it relieves the stress of being trapped behind a desk for 8 hours .... plus it fixed the paper jam :P 
getting ready for our performance at Patriots Stadium tonight ! w00t w00t ! 
I'm on a high , on a high , nothin ' more to it ... 
5/20/10 - 11:55 PM EST ..... Clair de Lune officially complete ...... now ... to make it .... PERFECT :P 
my 87 year old grandma just opened a credit card < PROPMALE > , gasped at the amount , turned slowly to me and with the straightest face says , \too bad I wasn't born < PROPMALE > instead of sooo good looking . \ " grandmas are awesome :P " 
Practice , practice practice ... practice some more .... and then ? When you think it's perfect ... you've only just begun to know what perfection is . And it's then that you return to where you began ... to practice and practice and practice again . Thus ... is my creed . 
granted .... i'm not happy my parents are in Hawaii without me .... i must say i do love it when they find random Japanese people during their travels and have them call and talk to me in Japanese . Cuz then I get to talk about them right in front of them and they have NO CLUE what we're saying :P 
is it time for karate yet ? ugh .... desk jobs will be the death of me ..... must .... moooooooove ..... 
so .... i found some old pictures of me from my \flip days\ " ... and ya know ... before \ " it all went wrong\ " ..... which i was tempted to post ... but if i do .... i WILL lose ALL and ANY credibility i have .... decisions ..... decisions .... " 
* sigh * .... i can't believe i'm doing this .... i SWORE i never would .... i must be dying or something .... view at your own risk .... cuz there's a good < PROPMALE > i'll be silencing all those who see the truth .... 
XMA tonight at < PROPMALE > High ^_^ b 
piano therapy until i pass out , my fingers fall off , or i feel better ... 
being a lone wolf is the easiest and hardest thing in the world ... you're detached from any unnecessary complications , avoid drama , play by your own rules ... but at the end of the day ... you only have yourself to keep you company ... 
Dear 5am ..... we really need to stop meeting this way ... i'd rather sleep with you ... Sincerely , Me 
what gives ?!?! my parents are in hawaii WITHOUT me and my mom bursts into tears on the phone because i wasn't jumping for joy for their plans .... so now not only do i get to feel left out ... i get to feel guilty about it too .... so messed up .... 
so not cool that it's such a beautiful day and i have to eat lunch at my desk staring pathetically out the window ... 
45min till freedom ... 
freedom + karate time = happy :) 
i give up </3 
i'm tired of feeling this way , i don't want to hurt anymore .... but i just can't bring myself to let this go ... 
?????????????????????????????????????????????????? 
watching an entire season of an Australian western reeaally isn't helping me suppress my natural tendency to speak with an Aussie accent ... 
i'm all cried out for one night ... packing , shower , then off to bed . 
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are shooting stars ? I could really use a wish right now ... 
Rushing and racing and running in circles . Moving so fast I'm forgetting my purpose . Blur of the traffic is sending me spinning . Getting nowhere . My head and my heart are colliding , chaotic . Pace of the world , I just wish I could stop it . Try to appear like I've got it together . I'm falling apart . Save me , somebody take my hand and lead me . Slow me down . 
Sometimes I fear that I might disappear in the blur of fast-forward I falter again . Forgetting to breath , I need to sleep , I'm getting nowhere . All that I've missed I see in the reflection . Past me while I wasn't paying attention . Tired of rushing , racing and running . I'm falling apart . Don't let me live a lie before my life flies by . Slow me down . 
An entire day filled with movies , karate and friends = pure awesomeness . ^_^ 
just got the keys to my place ! off to practice then piano shopping ^_^ 
had an awesome practice and just got my piano ! ^_^ 
another productive day at work designing my XMA make-up for graduation on Saturday ^_^ b

That's the girl who lives on the 17th hole !! \ " \ " I've heard of her ! Wow ! \ " I seriously hate the game but I love the attention lol :P Shot 83 ... not bad considering the last 18 holes I played was Aug . ' 09 and only the 2nd time out this year . "

Why is it that when someone tells you there are billions of stars in the universe you believe them ... but if they tell you there's wet paint somewhere .... you have to touch it ? 
I thought being bribed would be more enjoyable ....

Loving my new droid x ^_^ 
<3 my karate girls ^_^

\I dream for a living\ " ~ < PROPFIRST > Spielberg " 
i'm going to go with this is one of the coolest places i've ever stayed at ..... the tub alone has made my life ..... please see posted video .... 
Omg ... it's so beautiful I'm going to cry ..... 
XMA rock the house tonight ! Thinking of you ! 
\Growing old is mandatory ... growing up is optional . \ " ~ Chili < PROPMALE > " 
Don't be fancy just get dancey . Why so serious ? 
If my job were a person .... I'd punch it in the face .... 
I dreamed a dream in time gone by ... 
I'm pretty sure I've been driven to the point of taking up drinking .... fortunately ..... or unfortunately ... my version of that involves consuming mass amounts of sugar until everything is laugh-so-hard-you-cry-and-can't-breath funny ..... now where did I put those Pixie Stix ? 
At the Jets stadium waiting for the game to start . ^_^ 
Have you thrown a fist full of glitter in the air ? Have you ever looked fear in the face and said , \I just don't care . \"" 
Have you ever thrown a fist full of glitter in the air ? Have you ever looked fear in the face and said , \I just don't care . \"" 
Of only things were worse they'd be so much better .... 
Early Christmas presents are a beautiful thing in itself .... but to have them delivered to the office so I get to play with it all day ? That's just magic in it's purest form . :P 
I just found out I'm CIA .... oh the amazing things I learn when I'm with my father ... 
Soooooo tired .... still driving back from the city .... can't wait to get home and get some sleep . Big day tomorrow !! Graduation and office party . XMA BABY !!! 
work needs to be over and it needs to be Christmas NOW ...... just sayin ' ..... 
I've decided upon a new attitude for 2011 . Most people never have the privilege of having a passion or being able to identify what it is that moves every fiber of their being and makes the impossible a welcomed challenge . In the new year I refuse to allow myself to let my passion be a burden ... but instead let it be a guiding light , an inspiring force , and the < PROPFEMALE > ball that brings my dreams to life . 
So glad I stayed in < PROPMALE > after Christmas .... my reward for such an act is being dragged into work at 6am via carpool with my dad ..... yippie ..... skippie ..... I hope everyone else in the office is enjoying their warm beds and extra sleep .... 
This week .... 2 feet of snow complete with snowboard gear and ski mask ..... next week bathing suit , sunshine and some kangaroos ^_^ . 
Clearly there's no way I can focus on work when all I can think about is kangaroos , koalas , and the amazing accent I plan on obtaining . 2 MORE DAYSSSS !!!!! 
Soooooo ..... tomorrow I fly to LA and have an 8 hour layover until our flight to Melborne .... I'm thinking I'm going to have to pay a visit to the XMA Headquarters >:D 
I'll be starting off 2011 with a day of immortality ... considering I \won't exist\ " on < PROPFIRST > . 1st . I kinda like it ^_^ . So I hope everyone has a wonderful New Years ! " 
landed in LA and currently trying to coherse my mom into crashing the xma hq :P 
Oh Australia .... you have exceeded my dreams and expectations in so many ways .... except one ..... contrary to popular belief the water does not spin the oposite way when you flush the toilet , it goes straight down ... ahhh well .... 
I just saw some people doing parkour while riding down the river on a tour ... needless to say I had to fight the urge to jump ship and join them . 
I absolutely love this country . I'm so moving here ! 
nothing like hiking in the Australian outback in 110 degrees . 
time to sleep ! big day tomorrow ! going snorkling in the great barrier reef ! 
the barrier reef was AMAZING !!! now its time to check out the rain < PROPMALE > ^_^ 
gyah ! I'm seeing madam butterfly on opening night at the < PROPFIRST > opera house ! 
Goodbye Australia !! I'm going to miss yoooou !!! You were so amazing and I'm definitely coming back !! Tomorrow the adventure continues as I make my way to my other dreamland ! NEW ZEALAND !!! 
my dream trip is slowly coming to an end ... I'm sad but at the same time my friends are making it quite clear they miss me and want me back . which makes me happy cuz it means I'm loved ^_^ 3 days till I'm back in the good old US of A . 
i just had the longest sunday of my life .... about a 38 hour day . 20 hours on a plane .... so unbareably tired .... our luggage has been lost by the airlines and will hopefully be mailed to us sometime this week ... and my dad's welcome home speech ? \we're leaving for work tomorrow at 7am\ " .... i want to go back to New Zealand :( " 
Kiaora Aotearoa ..... Haka oi . 
My mom and I called Outback Steakhouse and ordered take out last night .... I almost cried when the recording came on and said \G'day mate ! Welcome to Outback ! \ " :( i waanna gooooo baaaaack ! " 
I FINALLY downloaded ALL my pictures from my trip ... the official final count ? 6,638 pictures . Now .... to organize them all and pic out what I want to post ..... oh boy ... 
If only I had a dollar for every time the phrase \I'm going to kill my father\ " past my lips I wouldn't need a job .... -_-" 
I was born of wolves and cultured by bats . Yet on nights such as these we howl at the full < PROPFEMALE > and are transformed . 
I'm in total shock right now ... watching the news with my parents and they showed pictures of the damage Christchurch took from the last earthquake .... they showed the church square in rubble which was my view from my hotel while I was there . My heart goes out to all of New Zealand and my prayers are with you . 
Tonight is more important and more special than any other night , more than my own birthday .... why do you ask ? Because the Oscars are on and I can escape to the world I covet more than anything . Plus I get to work on my acceptance speech :P 
Just got released from the hospital ... I hope that never happens again .... so tired ... 
<3 ' s her new iPad ^_^ 
Getting ready to see spiderman on broadway !!! And of course I'm having a heart attack because there's an XMA guy in the cast . 
Having lunch with Master < PROPMALE > Liborio ^_^ thrn back to round two of training . 
Thank you everyone for all the wonderful Birthday wishes !! ^_^
