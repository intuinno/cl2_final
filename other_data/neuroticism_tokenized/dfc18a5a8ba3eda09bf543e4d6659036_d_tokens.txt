~ > need coffee , lots and lots of coffee 
Going house hunting in a little bit 
Im feeling a little emotional and vunrunable after today :( 
got caught in the rain tonight in milwaukee ... not fun ! 
i am putting off cleaning ... 
The baby was weighed yesterday ... shes 12 lbs 15 ozs 
< PROPMALE > Potter and the Half- Blood < PROPMALE > is coming out July 15th ! Cant wait ! :) 
did ya hear < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > died ? 
We got pics taken at the mall today :) 
I am so tired 
Tommorow morning I am leaving to go to San < PROPFIRST > . I think I will learn alot . 
Wish I had time to check up on everyone :( Busy , Busy ! LOL San < PROPFIRST > is freezing ! ( Low 60's with wind ! ) I will try and check in again tommorow . 
I am so far behind because of NAMI National . I had a great time , learned some stuff , networked like crazy . :) San < PROPFIRST > was great except cold . Met lots of people . 
I just wanted to say again , I had a wonderful time at NAMI National and meet some wonderful people . But now I feel kinda unreal . Like San < PROPFEMALE > was real and my \real life\ " is fake . Anyone else feel that way ? " 
What a day . I have to go to work now , then I get the pleasure of going to the dentist ! Yeah ! And then if im not in too much pain from that I should go over to the walk in clinic and talk to a doctor about something thats been going on ... Fun , Fun . 
I so hate people who act like their giving you a choice when you know and they know that you dont have a choice . My husband says their being polite . I disagree . IMHO , their being condesending . It really ticks me off . 
Wow , so now im bummed . I just found out that < PROPMALE > Potter opens at midnight and I am not there standing in line ! 
So , Im sitting here debating weather or not to wake up my daughter so we can go to church . I like church , but right now I am stressed out and need to take care of myself , and going to church seems like too much of an obligation . 
Listening to < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > on Yahoo Music , reminds me of Badlands ;) 
Have to go to the dentist soon . :( Again . Someone else go for me ? Please ? 
Gotta go take Sonnie to swimming now , then work 
Im so happy . It looks like barring any complications ( I will think positively ) We are getting a house ! I want to mention that we had a great realtor . :) Happy Dance time ! 
My computer caught a nasty virus and thats why I havent been around ( In case anyone was wondering ) I nuked my puter , but I need to add an antivirus before I can come here ( or if im not too busy at work ... ) ;) 
I finally have my computer up and running . I think its the way its supposed to be now . I hope . Welcome me back to FB ! LOL . J/K I missed you all . 
I think i need to go to bed tonight ... too many people i know with people dying . I will be thinking of < PROPFEMALE > tonight , I wish there was something I could do to help her . Youre in my thoughts and heart , < PROPFEMALE > . 
Just got done with a teleconfrence ... sometime today i need to go to walmart to get tyedye stuff for work and i wanna go swimming today ! 
Did ya hear the one where < PROPFIRST > favre is going to the vikings ? is anyone even surprised ? 
I have to do a WRAP presentation at the Mental Health Center soon . ( I hope the babysitter gets here in time ... ) Wish me luck , please ! 
How many diffrent farm apps are there here anyway ???? 
wondering if i should go to bed or stay up until < PROPMALE > gets home from his internship 
so get this , i went to the dentist yesterday to get some teeth drilled and filled and left with a root canal . now how does that work ? 
i seriously need shorts/pants that fit all of mine are too big 
tonight we get to go to sonnies new school for her open house 
So heres the situation . We were supposed to close on a house today . We were pre-approved . We transferred everything to the new place , electric , mail , etc . We need to be out of our apt by Monday , school starts Tuesday . < PROPMALE > got a call yesterday that the < PROPFEMALE > was denied . I was like wtf ? So the banker is looking into some other options but it looks like we are going to be staying with my mother in law for a bit ... 
Also , we have to cancel or change everything we set up . I have to go to the post office today to cancel the change of address and change it to her house . I dont know about school for my daughter , we set it up in Watertown , now we dont live there ? I have to call her old school and talk to them . I am pissed , upset , and stressed . 
so with everything that happened yesterday , including the dentist i declare that yesterday offficially sucked !!!! 
So today we move all the rest of our stuff over to < PROPFEMALE>'s ( big stuff to storage ) then clean this place top to bottom , tommorow we have the walk-through and give them the keys and I gotta go to Stevens Point for a Trau < PROPFEMALE > Informed Care 1 day confrence- I hope the weather clears up ! Anyway , I dont know when ill be on a puter again after this morning . 
This sucks not having internet . The puter at work is very slow . I kept trying to go back and read ppls posts , but its too hard on this thing . I am so tired . 
ok im gonna try again to look back at ppls posts hopefully i wont get frustrated again lol 
I am sending love to all of my special friends . Especailly all of the people who are in a bad place right now .

so today i did an excellent presentation on person centered planning at the mental health center my co presenter was cool too :) 
I hate mornings 
My coffee \high\ " has worn off now :( I guess I need a nap ( or more coffee ? hmmm ? ) lol " 
Here is something from NYAPRS : ( New York Association of Psychatric Rehabilitaton Services ) NYAPRS Note : People with psychiatric disabilities are not only not more violent than the general public , they are almost 11 times more likely to be victims of violence that the general public and , given today’s new study’s findings , almost 5 times more likely to be victimized than other Americans with disabilities .

Ok , Im having a debate with my husband ( who's a social worker . ) He thinks that Borderline Personality Disorder really is a personality disorder , i.e. its a part of you , you can never fix or change . I have heard that in the DSM-V they are going to re-classify it as a trauma based mental illness ( akin to PTSD and DID ) . Mabye they will call it emotional disregulation disorder . Anyway , that is more to what I believe . 
does anyone want to go somewhere right now ? idk where we go or what we do but i really need to go somewhere . i was supposed to go out with someone , but they bailed on me 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas to all , and to all a good night ! ;) 
So Im a day late but ... In 2011 , what are you going to do to help your recovery ? Are you going to join a self-help group ? Are you going to take a class and learn more about your illness ( e.g. NAMI's Peer to Peer Program ) , are you going to take better care of your physical health ? Discussions please ! 
Well the good news is that I have lost over 50 lbs and can actually fit into a size 8 jeans ( I have never done that before ! ) So yea me ! The bad news is I need to go one size bigger for dresses because I am still large on top , in fact , I have no clue what size I am but I still cant buy off the rack , grrr . 
HOW DID WE MEET ? Everyone play this game ! Copy and paste this phrase on your profile , you will find it amusing to remember how you met and how you know each of your friends !! Before you do that , answer for me ....

DEPRESSION is not a sign of weakness it is a\ 
sign that you have been trying to be strong for too long . Put this as your\

but it's mental health week and 1 in 3 of us will suffer it at some\ 
point in our lives . Show your support good people :)

there are 3 kinds of people in the world . think back to when you were in school . 1 ) the people who purposefully hurt others ( bullys ) 2 ) the people who stand by and watch the bullying but dont step in and 3 ) the very rare few who stand up for the people being bullied which are you ? ever thought about it ? people can change , but they have to admit their shortcomings .

Repost ( from < PROPFEMALE > Cisco ): What is sad is the fact that all of those people showed up to the capitol yesterday and will again today to save their jobs ( which I sure don't blame them ) ..... but who will show up and speak about Medicaid and fight for rights of the people who rely on it in order to live in their own homes ? 
Now Im pissed . Teacher sick outs indeed .

The doc's think he is strong enough today for them to do surgery on his broken leg !! He needs our prayers everyone ... please help out !! \

A little bit sad that I woke up to the darkness again . I was liking the sun coming up in the morning . Now I get to wait until summer I guess . 
The Girl you just called fat ? She has been starving herself & has lost over 30lbs . The Boy you just called stupid ? He has a learning disability & studies over 4hrs a night . The Girl you just called ugly ? She spends hours putting makeup on hoping people will like her . The Boy you just tripped ? He is abused enough at home . There's a lot more to people than you think . Put this as your status if you're against bullying

DEADLY TERMS USED BY WOMEN : 1 . FINE : This is the word women use to end an argument when they KNOW they are right and you need to shut up . 2 . NOTHING : This means SOMETHING and you should be wary . 3 . GO AHEAD : This is a dare , NOT permission . DON'T DO IT ! 4 . WHATEVER : is a woman's way of saying F*YOU ! 5 . THAT'S OK:She's thinking long and hard before deciding HOW and WHEN you WILL pay for your mistake ! RE-POST AND SAVE A LIFE 
I started keeping track of my walking ( on the treadmill ) So far this week I have walked 3.069 < PROPMALE > . :) 
Doesn't make sense ... Homeless in the U.S. go without eating . Elderly in the U.S. go without needed medicines . Mentally ill in the U.S. go without treatment . American troops go without proper equipment . American veterans go without benefits that were promised . Yet we donate billions to other countries before helping our own first . 1% will re-post and 99% won't . Have the guts to re-post this 
its about time to start my day sigh today will be a long one , tommorow not so much 
** If you have a wonderful man who helps balance your whole world ... who isn't perfect but is perfect for you ... who makes you laugh and drives you crazy , who is your best friend , who takes care of you , who you want to grow old with and who you are thankful for everyday , then brag a little and re-post this as your status . 
Getting exiticed about Empowerment Days ! I have appointments with ( staff ) my representives office ( Kleefisch ) and the Lt . Gov's office ( Kleefisch ) . Still waiting on the senator ...

Almost time to go to the Capitol . Going to do the press confrence then meeting with staff for the Lt . Governor and Governor . Nervous .
