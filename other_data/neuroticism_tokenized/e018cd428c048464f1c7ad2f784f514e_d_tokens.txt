acquired a pair of the ugliest shoes ever ... Crocs ... I have to tell you , people , they are the most comfortable shoes I have EVER worn !

So I sliced my right ( dominant ) thumb open today ... shoulda got stiches ... it was pretty funny trying to count out pull tabs and write my books . Counting out bingo cards tomorrow should be fun . Cooking at < PROPFIRST>'s for 12 hrs . sunday and then cleaning houses all week ..... UffDa ! :/ Bad timing ! 
Oh , for < PROPMALE>'s sake ! If I had a super power , it would be to stop time and just regroup for a minute . Jeesh !!!

I can DO this !... ( but after I'm just gonna die , ok ? ) 
This is the first ... \nobody here\ " ... in a too long time . I like it . " 
It's so nice to have a day off to do NOTHING . I brushed my teeth . I think that's plenty for today . 
Well , here I go for round 2 ( or 4 , or 6 ) . I have not even counted how many days until I have one off again . I think 2 weeks until my next sunday off . Most days for the next 14 I work 2 jobs .... Lock and load ! 
Going to the Legion tonight to See Sugar Buzz with < PROPFEMALE > . Anyone want to go ? 
Sending love to < PROPFIRST > for a speedy recovery , and love to her family for peace and strength . goodnight , all . 
Going to bed after a GREAT night with my friends . A little downtime was just what I needed ! 
I really miss my motorcycle on days like this . 
I left my phone at < PROPFEMALE>'s! 
Some people don't think past the end of their nose . When you plug in your electric car , your electic company most likely got the energy from natural gas ...... hmmmm ... 
I'M A HANDFUL !!! Unfortunately most women won't re-post this . I'm strong-willed , independent , and outspoken . I make mistakes , I am sometimes out of control , and at times hard to handle - but if you CAN'T handle me at my worst you sure don't deserve my best !!! If ... you're a HANDFUL then post this on your status .... 
Sports ... the opiate of the masses . 
How about it Vike's fans ? The Favre/Moss thing not workin ' out for ya so well ? I prefer wheels to balls , and my guy ( J.J. ! ) is first in NASCAR points . 5 consecutive champinships likely for you ballers !? ... Nooooo ... lol ! 
just realized that my ENTIRE family will be together next weekend ! better charge the camera . :D My daughter renewing her vows on friday , and sister getting married on saturday . Can't wait ! 
< PROPFIRST > Walsh ... sweet ... my life has just taken a right turn , and I LIKE it ! 
What a lovely evening . My friend < PROPFEMALE > had the BEST Halloween party yet ( gets better every year) ! Loved being the DD and watching the train wrecks from the outside ! LOL ! Thank You , < PROPFEMALE > !!! 
Awesome party at < PROPFEMALE>'s last night ! Talladega and trick-or-treating with < PROPMALE > today ! Love having a couple of days off . 
I'm kinda happy , for some reason . What a GREAT Halloween . Life is upside down , but somehow rightside up because of it . 
So , why do we still have daylight savings ? Farming technology allows them to work after dark , and they DO , regardless . The cows need to be milked at the same time , no matter what your clock says , so .....?? I heard something about it being because it's better for school bussing the kids . 
THAT was a white-knuckle ride !!! Just drove home from Apple Valley , never hit third gear even on the freeway . Cedar Ave . bridge was a joy . I'm glad my son was with me ! This is the BEST glass of wine I have EVER tasted ! I have been driving for 26 years and that is the worst ice I have ever been on . 
I'm gonna TRY to spend tomorrow by myself , in my sweats , hanging with my cat . Let's see how that works out ! lol ! 
Shreck the Third just came from Netflix today . Should wait and watch it with < PROPMALE > , like I planned ........ hmmmm ....

What an awesome day ! I SO needed that . ;) I love my friends , I am so blessed to have such wonderful people in my life ! 
Snow Day ! Thanks to my boss , for not letting me drive in this ! 
watching my neighbor snowblow , and it's up to his knees . This is just like Haloween ' 91 ! we'll have a couple of feet , easy ! 
the car is burried , and Metro Transit is still down ! have to have a co-worker pick me up . :/ After work ... find the car ! lol ! 
Well , it's official . I'm going to Phoenix in feb . to see the NASCAR RACE !!!!!!!! :D

I'm nursing a cold tonight . I'm thankful for all of my co-workers , at all 3 jobs , for bieng there for me and each other . I appreciate all of you ! :) 
I'm so sick of being sick ! 4 days ... 4 DAYS ! really ? >:( 
Ugh , I've missed 6 shifts in 5 days ! This cold is literally ruining my life !!! Now I have a $250 car repair . I'm down under again . What a crock ! Please , everyone , wish , pray , reiki it away ? I am grateful . 
Just an update for my co-workers . I woke up at 3:30 with 103.2 fever . Going to urgent care now . I'm suspesting sinus infection and/or bronchitis ... this bites . 
Ok , there were several people in Urgent Care today who seemed to have the same thing that I do . The doc says she's seeing alot of it . I starts out looking like a common cold , but is really a lung infection that requires antibiotics . If your cold lasts longer than 4 days , and you have chest congestion , GO IN . She's seen it turn into pneumonia . 
It's my 7th day cooped up and sick . Everyone knows no alcohol with antibiotics ... no problem . Out of it me just reads the bottle today- no dairy or antacids within 2 hours of taking one ... problem . Those of you who know me get this . If I have inadvertantly prolonged this thing I am gonna go postal . seriously . 
I'm finally going back to work tonight ! still feeling a little weak , but I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE !!! I havn't left my apt . for 9 days . Is it summer yet ? 
note to self : awesome that you have a car that lets you start it and take the keys out of the ignition and lock it while it warms up .... if you remember to take them out . 
I have been working SO much ... I miss my kids , and my grandkid ! Gonna work my butt off more , because I get 5 days off to go to the NASCAR race in Phoenix in less than two weeks ! :) 
I had my car towed last night because the plow drift was too big to get into the lot . I have retrieved it , brought it home , and the street is still not plowed ! Ya think I'm paying that ticket ? NOT . 
I have been excited for months for my trip to Phoenix and the race , and I keep having to overcome these little things getting in the way ! 2 more days ! Please , universe , leave me alone or do something to help out ! Jeesh ! lol ! 
Leaving for the airport in 20 minutes . I can't believe it's actually happening ! Tomorrow we go shooting , sunday nascar , grillin ' , chillin ' , and swillin ' in between ! I'm taking a rednecks dream vacation ! 
OHMYGOD I GET TO RACE A CAR AT RACEWAY PARK THIS SUMMER !!!!!!!!!!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH !!!!!!!!!! 
Talledega tomorrow ! The Valley Lounge will be invaded by Frenchie's folks tomorrow ! See you there ? 
I'm so proud of this four-generation picture ! < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > , and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > ! 
I have discovered that I don't have a real cat . I have a self-cleaning rug ... that rotates itself to change into pretty colors ....... 
Holy smokes ! If anyone disagreed with me about < PROPFIRST > Bush being a pussy , do you believe me now ? When Harvick got out of his car , bush pushed Harvicks car into the wall to run away from him ! LOL ! Even the pit crews were fighting !
