I just wanted to share with you all lyrics from a song which I couldn't have written better myself to describe my life and the way I feel with a song . I have never been able to relate to a song even close to as much as I can this one . I also did a cover of it , video coming soon to YouTube . ( will be multiple posts ) 

It seems like every day’s the same\ 
and I’m left to discover on my own\ 
It seems like everything is gray\ 
and there’s no color to behold\ 
They say it’s over and I’m fine again , yeah\ 
Try to stay sober feels like I’m dying here\ 
\ 
And I am aware now of how\ 
everything’s gonna be fine one day\ 
Too late , I’m in hell I am prepared now , \ 
seems everyone’s gonna be fine\ 
One day too late , just as well 
I feel the dream in me expire\ 
and there’s no one left to blame it on\ 
I hear you label me a liar\ 
‘cause I can’t seem to get this through\ 
You say it’s over , I can sigh again , yeah\ 
Why try to stay sober when I’m dying here\ 
Too late , I’m in hell\ 
I am prepared now , \ 
One day too late ; just as well 
And I’m not scared now . \ 
I must assure you , \ 
you’re never gonna get away\ 
And I’m not scared now . No \ 
I am aware now of how\ 
I am prepared now\ 
One day too late , just as well\ 
seems everything’s gonna be fine for me 
For me ; for myself . \ 
For me , for me , for myself\ 
For me , for me , for myself 
What of the tides of the celestial abyss known as oblivion ? To sail the waters of such is to know true pain . Alas , I am in my fourth year at sea . 
Most people have 1000 wishes for Christmas ; a cancer patient only has one , \ 
to get better . I know 97% of you won't repost this to your status , but\ 
my friends will be the 3% that do . In honor of someone who has died , or\ 
is still fighting , or survived cancer , copy this to your status 
What do you do when you lose part of yourself ? When half of your heart and soul goes away . When everything that used to be good and satisfying in life has lost all of its appeal . When you look at all the amazing things you have around you , and realize that it all means nothing without that essential piece . When all you can do is stare into space , and fight back tears . 
When your life loses its light , and seems unworthy of living . If this piece of yourself was the only thing that kept you alive in the first place , for your life was already unworthy of living . There is only one thing you could do , and that is to wait for time to heal the wound , and fill the hole . I hope I can survive long enough to see that day . 
Fuck my family man . I swear , I am done with this shit . 
* loud burp * Damn I love cheese sticks . 
The depression is .... so ... strong .... The pain is utterly unbearable . Someone , something , please ... make it stop . 
Blind faith is foolish . Having faith in the existence of an omnipotent being whom demands worship but refuses to show itself could be compared to having faith that an invisible pink unicorn wants you to bake cookies so it can make lazer beams fly from the chocolate chips and destroy fish a few < PROPMALE > out from the Philippines , or any other figment of your imagination speaking insane and equally irrelevant words to you 
Loving my new android . It certainly has all the bells and whistles . It has an app for everything . 
Found this awesome new game called zombie shooter . It looks kinda old as far as graphics go , but its still fucking amazing . 
One needs years of experience as a factotum to get ahead in today's world . 
2 mins ago my bday ended . 27 ... god ... You know , I'm starting to see the members of my favorite bands developing gray hair . It makes me feel that much older . When I started listening to Staind , < PROPFIRST > was young . Now look at him . Korn too , look at JD(Jonathan < PROPMALE > ) . 3 more years and I'm 30 ... someone shoot me .
