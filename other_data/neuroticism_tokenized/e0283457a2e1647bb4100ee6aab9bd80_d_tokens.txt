It has to be so lonely to be the only one who's holy\ 
It's just my humble opinion but it's one that I believe in\ 
You don't deserve a point of view If the only thing you see is you\ 
You don't have to believe me But the way I , way I see it\ 
Next time you point a finger I might have to bend it back Or break it , break it off\ 
Next time you point a finger I'll point you to the mirror

How do you face reality , when in your reality smiling when you feeling like crying has become more than a habit , but a necessity ?

Yah , idk either ... 
I wrote a poem today . & the first line was ' How come the rainbow is never bright on my side of the waterfall ? ' Which left me with two options , 1 . Move to the other side of the waterfall . 2 .

Put this as your status and leave it there for an hour , if you know someone who has or has had depression . Most people won't , but it's Depression Awareness Week and 1 in 5 of us will suffer at some point in our lives . Show your support . I copied and pasted , will you ?

Please put this on your status if you know someone who suffers from Rectal Cranial Inversion . This disease ( otherwise known as Head Up Your Own Ass Syndrome ) affects the lives of many . There is no known cure for Rectal Cranial Inversion but by posting this as your status for just one hour we can raise awareness . This cause is close to my heart as , sadly , I know many people afflicted with it on a day to day basis . They need help , and they need it now . 
I love < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > Sauberlich , and < PROPFEMALE > La Susa ! ? 
We all wish to have a new car ... new phone ... to lose weight ... a person who has cancer only wants one thing ... to have more birthdays . I know 97% of you won't put this on your wall ... but 3% of my friends will . Put this on your wall in memory of someone who died from cancer or in honor of someone who is fighting cancer .

Confession 3 : I'm currently writing a book , but it's taking forever because I am never satisfied with my writing . 
Confession 4 : I'm a hopeless romantic .

Confession 7 : I sing in the shower . And dance when no one is home .

Confession 9 : Despite my imense stage fright , and my constant ' need ' to judge myself , I am determined to be known someday . As a singer , and if that fails , I'll be an author . Either way , I want to make my < PROPFIRST > on the world . 
Confession 10 : I am a proud Wiccan . Despite what other say about it , despite the misconceptions , and judgments , I stand with my decisions and stand by them proudly .

Starting watching Ouran High School Host Club .... ? 
This ones for you and me , living out our dreams . <3 
Yes i have . 
< PROPFEMALE > , porshe and < PROPFIRST > right ? 
Gahh . I wish I knew what to do ... :( 
Well , my mood just went from 10 , to below 0 . Awesome . 
I'm tired . =P 
Ever have days where you second guess who you are , and why you're here ? Yah , this is one of those days . 
Sam : you have a saliva vein in the back of ur eye ? -gabby on phone- mumble mumbleSam : oh ! You have a throbbing pain in the back of your eye . Makes sense . Lmfa 
I died today . You got tired of me and took me to the shelter . They were overcrowded , and I < PROPFIRST > an unlucky number . I am in a black plastic bag in a landfill now . Some other puppy will get the barely used leash you left . My collar was dirty and too small , but the lady took it off before she sent me to the Rainbow Bridge . Would I still be at home if I hadn’t chewed your shoe ? I didn’t know what it was , but it was leather , and it was on the floor . I was just playing . You forgot to get puppy toys . Would I still be at home if I had been housebroken ? Rubbing my nose in what I did only made me ashamed that I had to go at all . There are books and obedience teachers that would have taught you how to teach me to go to the door . Would I still be at home if I hadn’t brought fleas into the house ? Without anti-flea medicine , I couldn’t get them off of me after you left me in the yard for days . Would I still be at home if I hadn’t barked ? I was only saying , “I’m scared , I’m lonely , I’m here ! I want to be your best friend . ” Would I still be at home if I had made you happy ? Hitting me didn’t make me learn how . Would I still be at home if you had taken the time to care for me and to teach manners to me ? You didn’t pay attention to me after the first week or so , but I spent all my time waiting for you to love me . I died today . Love , Your Puppy ~ It's time to stop animal abuse and neglect . ~ 
Bowling last night with < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPMALE > . ;) 
Someday , when I've reached my dreams , and you're sitting on the sidelines , you'll look back , and regret everything you ever said . Because while you are busy making friends and judging others , I'm busy working my ass off to get where I want to be . 
I hate this new facebook . XP && i love my wifey < PROPFEMALE > La Susa && my bestie Acacia Glocka . <3 
Creepiest night of my life . 
Heading to Chicage to pick up my mommy ! :D
