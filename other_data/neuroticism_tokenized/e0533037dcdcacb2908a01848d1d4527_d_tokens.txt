Listening to the storm outside .. I'm kinda worried about Beaula ... =/ 
I have to try .. If it's to be , it's up to me . 
My head is spinning ... And I feel kinda lonely .. I wish I had someone to go down this Path with me .. That's right , I used a captial ' P ' . :p 
I wish I had someone here to try my food ... I like cooking for other people , not just me . :( 
3 types of pasta , two sauces , 1 curry , and a pot of rice . i think i'm all set for meals this week . lol 
someone accessed my account from DENMARK ? The hell ?? 
me thinks I'll never be a big drinker , i had ONE Kahlua , cream , and soda , and i already have a headache , after a spazz attack of the leg , where i couldn't stop bouncing it ... 
Happy new year , everyone . 2011 , year of the rabbit , ( though not till February 3rd\ 
technically ) , let's hope it's a good one . 
Going to a new years/holiday party thing today at 2:00 PM , coming home tomorrow . Hope everyone's having a good day so far . =^.^= 
i got avatar on dvd , yay me . i still haven't seen it . lol 
I got to reconnect with people I haven't seen in a few years and I'm very happy I was able to do that . I'm coming home tomorrow ( wish me good weather so we don't get stopped in the mountains ! ^_^ ;; ) 
Home is where the heart is ... And I'm headed there . Clear skies and below freezing temperatures , here I come ... 
never mind ... some dumb-ass forgot her insulin back in Eureka and we had to turnaround and come back .. now we're leaving tomorrow ... -_-;; 
I'm being bad ... I'm having half a muffin and ... A CAN OF REAL COKE ! DUN DUN DUUUN ! And I'm super bored .... 
gotta love it when my ' life-saving ' meds try to kill me while I sleep ... I was saved from a coma by the miracles that are Pepsi and Applesauce ! Halleluja ! 
I got doughnuts , new clothes , a bracelet , and good food . I call that a pretty kick-ass birthday . :) Now , to write ! 
To every woman who knows that the right outfit can make you feel like a goddess , I finally get it . 
Stupid schedule ... Stupid indecision about the stupid schedule ... GRRRR ! * Bangs head on table * 
Well , I tried to die again this morning ... Twice in one week ! It must not be my week . 
Well , that by far was the scariest nightmare I have ever had in my entire life ... And the most vivid too ... 
Yes , please , < PROPFEMALE > , lay on my sprained ankle ... Thank you ... 
Seeing < PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland tonight ! WOO ! 
< PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland was INCRDIBLE ! I so want < PROPFEMALE>'s clothes ... Wow , I just sounded like a chick ... But I had a great date tonight with < PROPFIRST > , we had Sushi , went to < PROPFEMALE > , and cuddled on his/Matt's couch till I had to go home . 
cats make the best heaters ... :) 
so ... um ... is it bad that someone is describing my possession dream word for word , when they themselves , feel as though they have been possessed ? >_> <_< >_> 
someone should talk to me ... So I'm not freaking out ... 
I'm beginning to hate the movie Avitar and I haven't even seen it ... 
doncha just love it when you're told you have to get up early , about 6 hours before you have to get up ? 
Now suddenly I have 5 and a half hours to kill ... Stupid Burgerville ... Grrr ... 
Seriously ... Wtf ... Is this shit gonna keep on happening every time ??? 
Bwahahahaha ! I have Fable II once again ! 
So I ate some of the recalled Pringles ... Am I gonna die ? 
YES ! I'm going to Cirque du Soleil ! WOO ! * super happy dance * 
i really gotta stop this whole trying to die thing .... 
stupid old itlalian woman ... she's on her goddamned deathbed and she didn't even both to let us fucking know .... 
I know I made the right decision by staying , but now I'm not so sure about the ' alone ' portion ... I'm not okay at all ... 
okay ... so ... I haven't felt actually hungry since yesterday morning ... this , for me , as many of you know , is incredibly strange . I'm always hungry . So wtf is wrong with me ? 
is it sad that i STILL find the muppets hillarious ...? 
Hopefully , in the next few days , I'll be taking the first step towards independence ... Here's hoping . =/ 
waiting on the pizza ... 
Well ... I'm bored ... And lonely ... and there's no telling where things are gonna go from here .... 
my head is killing me .... >_< 
Watching The < PROPFEMALE > Bride and waiting for my Chinese food to get here ... 
Damn ... That was fast , it was barely 15 minutes before I got my food ... It was really GOOD too , the egg rolls were the size of burritos , and the portion of broccolli beef was HUGE .... I'm so stuffed .... I'll definitely order from them again . 
I'll probably be up all night now , but , I do love me some Oolong Tea ... 
heh .. making cookies at 3 am ... there are certain perks of being on my own , i have to admit ... 
so .... I'm still up and still not really tired .... i think my sleep cycle is officially jacked up ... 
I'm watching squirrels play tag on my back deck ... It's rather entertaining . 
is planning to enjoy this simply gorgeous day , hopefully without getting stung by a < PROPFEMALE > .. >_> <_< >_> 
borrowing my dad's net , because the power cord to my modem at home WALKED AWAY , I SWEAR ! >_< So I dunno when I'll have net back . If you need me , text me . 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE>'s gone ... 
fuck meeeeeeeee ... I hate flying and i'm gonna be on two planes all day thursday ... starting out from vancouver to san < PROPFEMALE > sico then from san < PROPFEMALE > to Eureka ... I'm going to be going alone too .. stupid remote Eureka .... >_< 
is seriously not looking forward to tomorrow ... Not eventhe zany antics < PROPFEMALE > Sciuto can cheer me up ... :( 
Egad , today was stressful ... But the funeral is done and overwith . Now we just have to clean out all of < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE>'s crap out of the house ... UGH .... Wish me luck all , cuz I'm going to need it . 
tried to die again ... 
well i don't feel like playing in traffic anymore ! I am so excited for my psych class ! ^_^ 
I found my old Psych notes from last year , as well as my text book so now I don't have to buy the new one ! YAY ! Now I just have to struggle through 4 chapters of A&P ... 
I gotta be ready to go at 7:30 AM , to go on this mini road trip with my dad , which is cool but ... Goddess Bless , I'll have to be up by like the ass-crack of < PROPFEMALE > ! 
can someone just kill me ...? please ...? maybe by some stroke of luck i'll be hit by lightning or the apocalypse will strike before he says \we're through \"." 
< PROPFIRST > and i are over ... 
boundry lines and item custody ... i might as well be swollowing glass shards while he's completely nonchalant ! 
.... i want him back ... yet i want to have a make over and look smoking hot and just go \#$%* YOU ! \ " Grr ... I'm signing up for a make over ... " 
I'm going to do everything , everything he never wanted to do , everything he was too afraid to do , I'm going to do it all . 
to ask or not to ask ... to grow mad with not knowing , or to have my heart break all over again with the knowledge that he doesn't miss me ? that is the question ... 
Wow ... I actually have plans for tomorrow ... I might be regaining a semblance of a life . 
it's amazing how easy it is to avoid reality when mindlessly watching tv ... actually living is much harder . 
back in public today ... kinda wish i wasn't ... i just feel like hiding away from the world for a while ... 
So .... I got another bombshell dropped on me today ... I might be moving to California this summer .... 
..... Love ..... Life ..... It's all complicated ...... 
too ... early ... ugh ... >_< 
Going to sushi with my dad tomorrow . I'm looking forward to it ... :) 
gah , stupid city lights .. now i won't be able to see the meteor shower thing tonight ... 
Off to yummy sushi ! :) Inari here I come ! 
< PROPFEMALE > out this evening . yay . :) 
had a pretty good time today hanging out . I think i'll be okay . 
I want another cat ... :( 
watching the old batman show ... can't get better than that ... 
oh that is fucking beautiful ... 
Hm ... Vision's going blurry ... Perhaps I should sleep ... 
I've decided that when I get my own place , I'm getting a bulldog . They're so ugly they're cute , plus , they don't need tons of exercise . Seems pretty fitting for me , don't you think ? 
I made home-made refried beans , I AM AMAZING . ^_^ 
FUCK ME ! I AM A < PROPMALE > DUMBASS ! 
False alarm ... Heh .... 
My god , I had forgotten just how kickass Nightcrawler is in the opening scene of Xmen II . Go < PROPMALE > Wagner ! ^_^ 
I want a puppy ... but I think my mom would kill me ... * sigh * 
Huh ... Apparently i DO know how to flirt ... Who knew ? 
Oh my god ... Mythbusters , < PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > being buried alive .... My claustrophobia is running rampant ... * shudder * WORST WAY TO DIE .... 
boys are stupid .. we should only keep them around for breeding purposes ... 
Since when did \good time\ " equate to \ " one night stand\ " ? >_< I'm beginning to hate the opposite gender ... " 
just shoot me , seriously . 
Don't you just HATE it when someone knows you and you don't recognize them AT ALL ? AGGHHHH ! Who IS this guy ??? It's gonna drive me mad till I find out ... 
Hm ... Kinda feeling like crap again ... 
Yay ! I get to go out to lunch with my dad tomorrow ! Pho here I come ! ^_^ And then I get to < PROPFEMALE > out with my friend later on tomorrow too ! 
I think I'm going to be sick ... Sometimes SVU just goes too far .... 
Dunno why , but I suddenly feel restless ... I wanna go out and do something , but I lack a social life ... 
FUCK YOU < PROPFEMALE > CROW , I DON'T WANT TO SEE SAD ANIMALS RIGHT NOW ! DAMN YOU AND YOUR BLACKMAILING GUIT TRIPS ! 
Doctor who , the stuff of nightmares and dreams ... * shiver * 
UGH ... People make me sick sometimes ... If I had a mood thingy like on myspace , it would say \Beyond Disgusted \"..." 
i dunno why , but i just feel so drained today .. 
I'm not ashamed to say that I am a fan of The < PROPFEMALE > Girls . I wanna be an old lady like < PROPFEMALE > . 
holy crap , a semi-serious episode iof family guy .... O_o 
Okay ... Really .... I understand , some people just aren't that great of spellers ... Grammer , online , is kind of a lot to ask sometimes ... I get it , sometimes it's just easier to leave out the punctuation ... No one's GRADING our posts ... BUT COME ON ! \are\ " is NOT the same as \ " our\ " ! >_<" 
Wow ... I'm ACTUALLY gonna go to bed before 3:00 AM for once ... 
Blah ... Going to study till my brain hurts .... 
i should really stop staying up late ... my mind just goes to bad places ... :( 
you know the day is gonna suck when you wake up crying ... 
While you SCREAM at your woman , there's a man wishing he could talk softly in her ear ... While you HUMILIATE , OFFEND , and INSULT her there's a man flirting with her and reminding her how wonderful she is . While you HURT your woman , there's a man wishing he could take care of her . While you make your women CRY there's a man stealing smiles from her . Post this on your wall if you'reagainst Domestic Violence 
hey < PROPMALE > college kids , who the hell knows how to work blackboard ??? >_< 
Teehee . Gargoyles . i love this show . ^_^ 
dear god , i went to bed at 4 am and i'm up at 8:30 , what's wrong with me ? 
I dunno why , but I'm really excited .... lol 
Great ... Well there goes my day ... Oh well ... =/ 
alright this westboro shit has gotten me mad ... 
Leave it to The < PROPFEMALE > Girls to cheer me up ... I love < PROPFEMALE > , she's the best . Haha . 
It's over now , the music of the night . 
Saturday , I'm at home cooking soup and cleaning ... Some might call this anti-social or sad , I prefer to call it a productive day . :p 
yay soup . :) Om nom nom nom . 
So ... the new doctor .... It's pretty damn creepy ... 
Hellboy and soup ... Sounds like a good day to me . :) 
Yanno , I think some birds are making a nest in the birdhouse above my back door ... I keep hearing chirping and a bunch of twigs are scattered by the door . 
Ugh ... I hate waiting ... >_< 
I really hate waiting ... Where's the fast forward button ? * grumbles * 
Muahaha ! I lost weight ! ^____^ 
*&^$ me .... >_< I have the assignment , but no printer in which to print the damn thing .... UGH ... 
Hermitage is starting to look attractive again ... I just don't get it , none of the reading material makes sense ! Am I just too dumb to understand it ? ARAGHHHHH ! THIS IS SO DAMN FRUSTRATING !! 
I love my mom ... She explained my homework in a way that didn't make me want to bash my head into the nearest wall ... She's so smart . <3 
So i tried to die during my sleep again ... thank god for root beer and nerds < PROPFEMALE > ... 
I'm nervous and excited , yet somehow calm . ( I'm also aware that you're reading this . * Waves *) ^_^ 
Today was a lot of fun . :) 
I can't wait for sunday . :) 
I hate waiting ... >_< 
I've found a new nemesis ... The Cheese Grater ... 
One month later and I think I'm doing better . I can actually listen to music and watch movies now ... 
I am < PROPFEMALE > , hear me croak , for I AM- TOAD GIRL ! 
BEGONE cold virus ! I banish you from my body ! YOU ARE NOT WELCOME HERE ! * passes out * 
don't you just HATE it when you have a < PROPMALE > food craving and you have no money in which to appease the craving ? T_T 
I forgot how cute Ewok's are ... Lol 
has anyone ELSE notice how < PROPMALE > looks high when he uses the Force ? 
Okay ... first time eating fast food in about a month ... the burger feels like a lead weight in my gut ... ugh ... 
Huge-ass raccoon outside my front door ... It's got all the pets in a panic ... 
Too ... Much ... Soup ... X_x 
My ribs hurt ... :( 
ok ... seriously ... i'm done with the coughing crap ... it just hurts now . >_< 
Muahahaha ! PIZZA ! Food craving soon to be appeased ! ^_^

Erythrocytes , Leukocytes , and platelets OH MY ! X_x My brain hurts .... 
One step forward , thirty-something steps back ... 
i think i need a hug . 
I'm caving ... I'm watching Ghost Adventures ... I may not sleep tonight ... 
-_-; oh my geez ... 
Auuuuughhh ... i just chomped on my fork .... T_T 
i feel like i'm in a senses-numbing fog ... my senses of smell and taste are completely shot cuz of this cold ... i almost wanna cry . T_T 
Is it bad that spent all of psychology comparing the personsality disorders to characters from batman ? 
Hehe . I have plans . ^_^ i might actually be getting one of these things ... what do you call them again ? oh yeah , a life . 
Yanno , there are moments where you just want to tell your brain to SHUT THE EFF UP so you can scrape together some form of sleep before your hour and a half commute to school ... 
gotta love having a breakfast of skittles and rootbeer .... 
Hopefully tomorrow goes well . here's hoping . 
I had fun today . Even if I was teased mercilessly ! 
It's sad , someone on tv has my name and i keep jumping . 
AUGH ! I had wondered what happened to < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > but he looks so OLD ! T_T I think I need to go OD on < PROPFEMALE > now ... 
Well ... Crap ... Now I just feel all sorts of warm any fuzzy ... >_< 
\Like\ " this status & I will write on your wall something I like about you . Set this as your status if you're brave enough . " 
Gah , I miss choir ... :( 
i can't even remember where the viking people came from on the capital one card commercials anymore ... 
I'm feeling a little like a chicken with it's head cut off .... Bakabakabakabakahhhh ... ( yes , that is my headless chicken noise ) 
I'm never going to eat again ... X_x 
Another AH-MAY-ZING night ... :) 
Okay , hm .. Ya think if someone talks to you around 2 in the afternoon about hanging out , that they might get back to you fairly quickly ... Not 5 . HOURS . LATER . >_< 
Om nom nom nom nom ... Pizza . ^_^ 
2 years out of high school ... don't i feel accomplished ... 
Must . Resist . Urge . To . Bash . Head . In . To . Wall ... 
Brain freeeeze ... >_< 
But ... But ... I don't wanna go to school today ... T_T 
\Ya wanna stare at her till she realizes she left us ? \"....\" YEAH ! \"" 
^_^ I get to see my bear tomorrow ! I'm so happy ! 
Since when does being 20 years old mean i'm suddenly 12 years old again ? 
First breakfast , then study till my eyes bleed ... 
hm , i forgot how much i enjoyed inuyasha .. 
Yanno , I never really realized how freaking SICK and SADISTIC the kid from the Home Alone movies is till now ... 
So now I /finally/ get to see my boy tonight ... Here's hopin ' . ;) 
I had a great time tonight and I can't wait to see him again . ^_^ 
For once , it would be nice to actually be able to rely on my professor , to know that he'll actually get back to me before the deadline . but does he actually answer my email ? OF COURSE NOT . 
Gah , scary-ass nightmare ... * shudder * 
I just dropped my laptop on my toe ... 
So I think I've found what my first tattoo is going to be , now all I need is money to pay for said tattoo ... 
so ... full .... X_x 
But ... But ... I liked the dorkface < PROPFIRST > ... :( 
I'm on freaking cloud nine , nothing and no body's gonna bring me down .... 
I'm going to be adventurous and make a bacon and cheese scramble ... :p 
>_< Can tomorrow just not come , please ? 
Something wicked this way comes .... >_> 
So .... I just spent the day with him .... not quite sure how i feel about it . i think i'm okay . 
I've noticed something ... I can tell the difference between the sound a cat makes when it's eating crunchy cat food and the sound a racoon makes when it's eating crunchy cat food . 
um ... I think the birds in my neighborhood are very confused ... it's the middle of the night , shouldn't they sing at < PROPFEMALE > ? 
Sweet potato chips , lemonade , movies ... lounge lizard days are the best ... :) 
Racoons are noisey eaters ... >_> 
oh my ... I think eating all of these cherries has made me look a bit vampire-ish . lmao . 
Sunburns = EVIL 
I didn't think it was possible to feel such conflicting emotions all at once , how is the mind , body , and soul not all split in half ? 
how is it possible to loath someone so completely without even having seen them , met them , or even know their name ??? 
Yesterday was incredible , I spent the day/evening with my boy , and the night with two of my best friends . ^_^ 
Applying for jobs ... Oh joy ... * rolls eyes * 
Gee ! Thanks for asking if i wanted to come ! So glad you thought of me ! 
can the 4th be done already ? that last big one made me jump clear outta my chair ... 
Playing Persona 4 , listening to WWIII outside my house .. 
Weeeeell , i'm bored and i want my bear ... * sigh * 
i'm crawling with cats ... they're so scared ... :( 
watching < PROPFEMALE > with < PROPFEMALE > and eating a blizzard , life is good . :) 
I get to see < PROPFIRST > tomorrow , I'm so excited . ^_^ Indian food and a movie , yay . 
i just got slashed by the same cat who last night leapt into my arms for comfort ... >_> 
Incredible day .... where's the repeat button when you need it ? better yet , where's the TARDIS when you need it ? 
I just got lost nearmy own neighborhood thanks to the damn construction , with high 80 degree weather , no sunscreen , no water , and bad shoes ... Ugghhhhhh ... * melt * 
i am amazing . i just made a homemade low carb smoothie . ^_^ 
Wow , what a day ... Phew ... 
So ... You're yelling at me because of something YOU broke ?... Yeah , that makes TOTAL sense ... 
I dunno what's with me today , I feel like a vampire , because no matter how much I eat , I'm still STARVING ... 
Headache , lightheadedness , and nausea , oh my .... Gotta love them yo-yo-ing blood sugars . @_@ 
Seriously ? Wtf is going on ? 
let's give this whole ' sleep ' concept another whirl , shall we ? -_-; 
i've discovered a newfound love for instant noodles ... yum 
ugh ... where's a rock i can crawl under ....? 
* looks for a rock to crawl under * 
So my first drive is tomorrow ... D: Hm ... maybe i'll miss it and use the excuse \I was dead at the time ! \ " ... or \ " I was on the < PROPFEMALE > ! With Steve ! \ " .... y'all think it'd be hard to fake my own death ? " 
My first drive at driving school and I LIIIIIIIVE 
< PROPMALE > and anime , sounds like a good night to me ... Now if only I could get the boy over here to glomp , then it'd be perfect . :) 
Guess who was an idiot and left her keys at home and had to crawl through her front window to get inside ? while the < PROPFEMALE > bush was attacking me , no less ... 
I was able to help him ... I'm so glad ... For once I wasn't shut out .. I'm so happy right now . 
While the mother's away , the child shall play ... ^_^ 
does anyone want to go out to Thai food with me ? i have money , i just need company . text me ( 360 ) 487-0821 
Take-out time . :( 
Today is going to go so damn slowly , just because I'm looking forward to tomorrow ... It's only Eleven o'clock , a full twenty-five hours before he gets here , is that too early to start pacing ? I almost dunno what to do with my self , I'm so excited . 
If you \like\ " this\ 
Empty house ... * sigh * 
So .. I had to climb through another window to get into my house again , only this time i slipped and sprained my pec mucles .. Who here has taken vicodin ? what should i be expecting ...? 
Auuuuuugh ... sneezing plus chest injury ..... ouuuuuch ... T_T 
Pizza's on it's way , woot . 
approves of Lays ' new Balsamic Sweet Onion Potato chips ... Om nom nom . 
My bed is fixed ! No more sleeping on the couch in my owm house with a chest injury ! HUZZAH ! 
I'm heading to California on Friday . Anyone want to < PROPFEMALE > out before I go ? 
I'm starting to regret getting Koby that bone to eat ... The sound of bones being gnawed on isn't a pretty one ... 
So I got clothes for the anniversary thing . They look pretty damn good , I have to say . ^_^

Hehe , I love the fake synchronized blood splatter of < PROPFIRST > ... Plus a glistening , shirtless < PROPMALE > Pit ... ;) 
I have returned ! 
* sigh * I'm kinda sick of this whole near death experience thing ... The novelty has long since worn off . 
Tell me three things that you love about me . And after that post it on your wall and see what people think of you . 
Seriously ? Over Eaters Anonymous ?? Bloody hell ... 
BOYS ARE FREAKING DUMB ! >_< 
So ... I'm bored , broke , and lonely ... Who wants to come over to watch movies and make cookies with me ??? 
Grilled cheese sandwiches and 1931 ' Dracula ' . Soon to be shared with one or two of my besties . Possible cookie production . Sounds like a good day to me . ^_^ 
I love < PROPFEMALE > Wisniewski . She's the most amazing person in the world :D 
< PROPFEMALE > hi-jacked my < PROPFEMALE > .... >_> 
Jessica : Apparently < PROPFIRST > is coming over . \ 
Me : Cool . \ 
Both : SHE DOESN'T GET ANY OF OUR COOKIE DOUGH ! \ 
...... \ 
Me : We're bitches .

Of course , Mom , use my charger when you have your own ...

So that's a sushi place and a Japanese place I've applied to ... Now if only I get a call back ... Hm .. 
Mom picked me up on my walk with Koby , then took me to Burgerville . I love mah mom . :) 
my cat , < PROPFEMALE > , by laying on it , is cutting off the circulation to my arm ... but she's so cuuuuuute . ^_^ ; 
This whole conscious thing is vastly overrated ... * yawn * 
Holy crap ... I'm an step-auntie again ... O_o 
I get to see him today ! ^_^ ( Here , lemmie save you the time , Marissa : * gags * :P ) 
Isn't it just GRAND how someone can rip out your heart one night and the next day act as if it never happened ??? Gotta love that selective memory ! * insert scathing sarcasm here * 
Yanno , if this keeps up , i might just take her up on her offer and go ... 
Off to see that doctor about my sleep apnea this morning ... Wish me luck ... :S 
jeez , c'mon , i already ate 7 potstickers , why am i still hungry ?? 
So i'm scheduled for a sleep study ... being told to sleep while iim hooked up to all sorts of machinery , yaaaay ... >_> but everyone and their father is saying how much better my sleep will be ... So i suppose it's a good thing .

Friends will help you tidy up your house , BEST FRIENDS will spend the weekend unburying you from your hoarding obsession . Love you guys . <3 
* Sigh * my bed has been sacrificed to the < PROPFIRST > Household Cleansing Movement/Spider Genocide . It's buried under a mountain of things we have yet to go through . All for the best , I suppose . And I've made an incredible discovery , I ACTUALLY HAVE A FLOOR IN MY ROOM ! After all this time , I had kinda thought it was just a bottomless pit of clothes and notebooks . 
is off to go through shoes .. or note books ... which ever strikes my fancy first . 
My room is clean . For those in the know , wrap your minds around that one , if you wiil . And I came really close to having a seizure tonight thanks to low blood sugars , closer than I ever EVER want to be again . I couldn't stop gasping , stuttering , and shaking . I've never been so scared in my life . So after a night like this one , I'm taking it easy tomorrow ... 
I am Toad Girl , hear me croak . 
< PROPFIRST > got a new fulltime job !!! ^_^ I'm so happy for him ! 
om nom nom nom ... though i had a < PROPMALE > wipe-out in the kitchen ... landed on my knee twice and ended up on my arse somehow ... 
Is off to buy the boy a cheesecake for his birthday dessert/congratulations dinner ! ^_^ 
you\ 
have a wonderful man , who is your whole world ... Who isn't perfect but\ 
is perfect for you .. Who works hard and would do anything for you ... That\ 
makes you laugh ... Who is your best friend ... Who you want togrow \ 
old with ... And who you are thankful for every day , then post this ......... as\ 
your status .

BOOBIES !!!! Perfect(o)(o ) , Perky (*)(*) , Fake (+) (+) , Cold (^) (^) , Big ( o\

I'm nervous about tomorrow's interview ... Goddess knows I need this job ... =/ 
Found an interview outfit : red and black top , black slacks , black leather jacket , red cashmere scarf , black shoes . 
Soooo I'm 95% certain I got the job . ^_^ 
When it rains , it pours ... :( 
g'night facebook , here's hoping . 
No sleep + PMS + High blood sugar = Incredibly foul mood ... 
Can't I just fastforward to the part of the day where Eworks calls me back and my midterm is over ? Please ? Pretty please ? I'm so tired .. 
< PROPFIRST > says I GOT THE JOB !!!! <3 <3 <3 ^_^ 
How do you like that ... Mom didn't even say \congrats\ " .... >_< :( " 
Doughnuts .... yummy ... ^_^ 
I want a puppy or a kitten ... * Sigh * 
Hocus Pocus , it ' been too long ... 
Hm .. Insomnia .. We meet again ... 
So my comp is on the < PROPMALE > ... again .. i think i have a virus ... it keeps shutting down randomly and the power supply is fine ... =/ i have all my stories and pics on a jump drive ... but i don't know what to do . 
watching 28 days later ... oh Cillian Murphy , how i do love your gorgeous sky blue eyes and lips you could land a small plane on .... 
I ///WILL/// finish this story ! Rawr ! 
Gee thanks for the encouragment ! I feel so loved and nutured , knowing you'll support me no matter what I choose to do ! GAH !!!!!!! 
So , I think instead of killing my self with NaNoWriMo sans a computer of my own this month , i'm going to go at a slow , but stead pace of 3+ pages a day , for 90 days . yeah , i'm chickening out , but i'm trying to be realistic . :P 
Honesty is a great policy to uphold , but perhaps it should be tempered with tact and understanding . =/ 
heading to my dad's place tomorrow to house-sit till saturday , and i'll have net and a word processor ! YAY ! 
I LIIIIIIIIVE ! T_T Facebook , i have missed thee ! Making cookies with < PROPFEMALE > Wisniewski and waiting for < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Savage to get her butt outta work , all the while CHRISTMAS MAGIC is happening !!!! And < PROPMALE > Manilow , because he can do anything .... ^_ ~ 
i should be cooking .. but my cohorts are still not conscious ... so ... for the folks coming over , you may be waiting for soup when you get here .. T_T 
made the very big mistake of working out yesterday , for the first time in like .. forever , and now i feel stiff ! like a freaking old woman ! 
I'm stuffed and exhausted , thanks everyone who came over ! i hope y'all had as much fun as i did . 
* sigh * 
wow , two conversations with mom and both ending with her hanging up on me like a fucking child , and she WONDERS why i chose to stay over here instead of come home ? take a wild guess , woman . 
I hate sleeping alone anymore , he's spoiled me . :( 
Getting my hair done today . Woot . 
I love my pretty new computer . * hugs * 
Happy gluttony day ! :) I'm thankful for my health , my family , my friends , and the new love in my life . 
Wtf ... seriously ? i'm beginning to really HATE holidays !

heading to bed with a full tummy and seeing the boy in the morning . woot . night all . :) 
UGH ! I overslept by practically 5 hours ! now i'm leaving in like 7 minutes to head to Gresham , what a day and I haven't even been awake for more than 10 minutes ! 
Eeeek . Going to Powell's and sushi with < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Malliet Sullivan and < PROPFEMALE > Nystrom on Sunday 
Playing Inuyasha : Secret of the Cursed Mask . Yes , I am a nerd , but I am proud of my nerdiness ! 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Malliet Sullivan : * High-pitched feminine voice * \Oh my god 
Uggghhhhh . Stupid addiction to anime , keeping me up this late when I gotta be up by uggggggggh 8:00 ... Curse you Inuyasha ! T_T 
Well , today was great until i got home .. I missed a call from my brother today ... 
My brother is moving back in ... I'm kinda in shock ... 
Gotta love when life sucker punches you ... my brother is moving in TOMORROW 
I'm watching scrooged and gotta say , i effing LOVE the physically abusive < PROPFEMALE > / ghost of christmas present 
mmm .. I'm craving Winco Gummi Butterflies something fierce 
Sigh ... I don't know why but I feel like I'm seconds away from tears ... No reason for it ... 
Grr ... I'm going to make my life better . But first ! Dinner . 
If you've ever wanted something ... If you've wanted something so bad it hurts ... If you've ever wanted something so bad it consumes your every waking thought and sleeping dreams ... The only thing that's stopping you is yourself . 
Ah , Craiglist , you never ceace to amaze me ... -_-; 
I finally feel like I'm going down the right path now , it may not be an easy or particularly lucrative path , but the rewards far outweigh any setbacks . Culinary program , here I come ! 
Change your FB profile picture to a cartoon from your childhood . The goal ? To not see a human face on FB until Monday , December 6th . Join the fight against child abuse . Copy & paste this as your status & invite your friends to do the same . Here is our < PROPMALE > to make a difference .... Here is our < PROPMALE > to work together ... toward a better future for all of our children that are yet to come . 
I want to be on What Not to Wear so badly ! T_T 
Any < PROPMALE > I could get a ride home from the airport tomorow from someone ? I can get $5 for gas 
jeez ... < PROPFEMALE > is sleeping on mom's alarm clock , setting it off ... it's so loud i can hear it from down stairs .... i'd better go wake the beast and let her know or she'll be late for work . 
I shouldn't have had that apple earlier ... now i broke the fast and want more food .... 
this afternoon , my bus was a half an hour late because someone pissed in the one before it , this evening i heard a story of unspeakable violence against an innocent child , next a story about the brutal abuse of an animal ... but then on the < PROPMALE > this afternoon , i saw a stranger give a mom shopping for her kid $30 when he didn't know her .. sometimes people can sicken me , but on the other hand , they can surprise me ... 
NOOOOOOOO ! They're REMAKING Interview with a Vampire !?? WHY ? 
feeling listless , going to make dinner to feel less useless . 
ugh .. i forgot how twisted < PROPFEMALE > umbridge in < PROPMALE > potter is ... 
I HATE job searching ... Ugh ... 
I got my christmas tree up , but it has pagan flair , with dragon-fly lights :P 
Kids with special needs aren't sick or gross or stupid , and their handicap is not contagious . They only want what we all want : to be accepted and loved . Can I make a request ? Is anyone willing to post this and leave it as your status for at least an hour ? It is Special Education Week , and this is in honor of ALL people ... who were born unique and with something to teach other 
Send a number to my inbox and I'll tell you how I feel about you with a status post tagged with that same number . And I'll be completely , totally honest . Whether it's something I want you to know or not . :) Try it ! 
92 : You are absolutely adorable and one of the most talented people I know , I only wish we could < PROPFEMALE > out more . I really admire your talent and quirkiness . Never c < PROPFEMALE > e ! 
31 : I really freaking miss you and your sense of self . you're very courageous and you don't care what anyone says , not to mention , you're hilarious . you need to come back to vancouver so we can < PROPFEMALE > out ! 
171 : We've known each other for so long ! To be honest , you kind of intimidated me as a kid .. But i've always admired your strength , even though we aren't that close . I wish we were though . It'd be nice if we could get to know one another better . :) 
2222 : I'm sorry to say that we've grown apart , but I guess that's to be expected . You're very vivacious and full of life , I wish you the best with your plans , whatever they may be . :) 
1010 : You're a good friend and I wish life was going better for you , but I'm trying to help you the best I can . You're a very sweet guy and I know you'll find someone who is as great as you are . < PROPFEMALE > in there , dude ! 
1030 : You , my dear , are a character . I love you to pieces , even though we don't get to see each other very often . I know you've been hurt before , I but I really do believe you'll pull through a stronger , wiser person because of it . Your smile and laughter are infectious and I love spending time with you . I know you'll achieve your dreams with gusto . 
Is off to play some more Grandia II 
Our sink is having some reflux issues and the chemicals < PROPFIRST > used to try and fix it are giving me a massive headache from the fumes ... Ugh ... screw this , i'm gonna go lay down ... 
I give up ... The fumes are too much , i'm retreating to my bedroom where the fumes can't get me ... maybe then my head will quit trying to split open . 
It's nice how eating food that you ate as a kid can be so comforting ... 
i was totally craving some < PROPFEMALE > and i just found a sucker in my purse . yay ! 
Going to cut down the Christmas tree with < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Malliet Sullivan , my dad , my stepmom , and my niece , < PROPFEMALE > on sunday . :) 
I want to make things better for him , he's so stressed ... Goddess , give me strength to help him through this , give him the strength to pull through . 
Once again , I have to turn down a job because of not being able to drive ... Now , where's the nearest wall I can bash my head into ...? 
I don't like planning things with my dad . I really don't , because they always manage to be canceled . When am I gonna ever learn not to get my hopes up ...? 
Okay , so I don't want to go to their church with them , I don't feel comfortable there . That doesn't give her the right to be rude to me . And to know that even though I'm his daughter , that he'll still take her side ... Sigh ... I don't know if it's even worth it to be angry or hurt anymore , or if it's just easier to be disappointed again . 
My fat cat < PROPFEMALE > snores SO loudly , she scares me sometimes ... 
For the first time I finally understand what it feels like to be the only girl in his world , a formerly foreign concept for me . I'm so happy I'm in tears . 
Just got back from the doctor appointment ... Docter Bains is a very nice woman , and was glad i got in as quickly as I did . I have < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Malliet Sullivan and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Savage to thank for that . 
just shoot me ... 
I'm done 
day one .... here we go . 
hm .. the meds must be working ... i'm plesantly full after only one bowl of < PROPMALE > . 
Okay so everyone probably knows this but the movie The Knowing , with < PROPMALE > Cage , is the most pointless movie I have ever seen in my entire life 
Wow ... I hardly ate anything today ( by my hobbit standards ) . maybe i'll start loosing weight with this new med ? Anyways , heading to bed after I do the garbage and recycling . Night all ! 
I was /gonna/ go back to sleep , but a rumbling in my tummy and a persistant ( attention-whore ) cat vetoed that decision ... 
chinese food feast , woot ! 
Remember that job with Eworks ? I still have it apparently ! 
Things are going great right now . I have a job that allows me to work only on weekends , lets me go to school , see my boy worry free , and I get to see my boy tomorrow and on sunday too . ^_^ 
My cat Maxine : Hey . Hey . Hey , you . * nudge * Love me . Don't ignore me * nibbles hand * LOVE ME * CHOMP * 
let it blow , let it blow , let it blow ... i don't want snow ! 
I had a great day with < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Malliet Sullivan and < PROPFEMALE > Nystrom , pizza , movies , and raunchy jokes . lmao . 
Gonna make some < PROPFEMALE > chicken soup and share it with < PROPFEMALE > Nystrom ^_^ 
* sigh * It's getting harder to leave him ... :( 
Hopping in the shower before I head to < PROPFEMALE > Wisniewski ' s with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Savage , excited for the festivities . ^_^ 
* sigh * It's sad to think of the friendships I've let slip through my fingers ... I miss the way things used to be ... I wonder if it's not too late , or have I broken those bonds beyond repair ? 
Everybody on the roads/ in the stores just needs to chill out . Whatever it is they're trying to buy/go to , I'm sure it's not life threatening . I nearly got ran over by a busy body in an SUV trying to speed out of the Costco parking lot . 
I am LIVID . How DARE she insinuate that I'm being LAZY after I helped mom cook the damn dinner that SHE and HER family ate ! Did she buy or cook a DAMN thing tonight ? NO ! WTF ! AUGHHHHH ! 
So this is Christmas ... And what have we done ? Another year older , a new one just begun ... 
I'd give up all my presents , all the yummy food , just to spend Christmas morning with him ... * sigh * 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas , Happy yule , hope you all have a wonderful day with your families . :) 
Heading to California in the morning and I'm not packed at all ... * Sigh * Hope mom lets me sleep on the way ... 
i hate it when i have these \career identity crises\ " ... I get this frantic urge to find \ " my\ " right career and that I must do everything rightthisveryfuckingsecond or my world will start crumbling around my ears or the sun will implode or something equally as melodramatic ... I'm just so confused ... again ... blah ... i know i'll be okay eventually .. " 
Not going to school this term ... Sigh ... FML ....

Screw this pity party bullshit , I need to stop feeling sorry for my self ... I'm making soup !

I shouldn't be conscious right now ... That's what every fiber of my being is saying to me , with consensus from my scratchy throat and runny nose ... 
Why do they keep remaking shows that were originally British , and great as they were ? If it's not broke , don't freaking fix it ! What next ? An American Doctor Who ? 
The only thing we can truly rely on is that time will flow on , with or without us . I'm going to ride the current till it takes me to my lover soon . 
I sincerely hate waiting ... I'm actually thinking of going to bed early , just to pass the time quicker ... But 7 PM maybe just a < PROPMALE > bit excessive on the earliness ... 
Igettoseehimtomorrow ! EEEEEE ! ^_^ ... That's pretty much what's on constant replay in my head right now . Hurry up , damn dog , i wanna go to bed ! 
I WILL beat this cold . I WILL help mom out with the house . I WILL find a job . Personal mantras , work your magic ! I think i can , i think i can .... 
It's a small world , after all ... :P 
If any of you love me , you'll bring me some NyQuil ... Or some soup ... Please , be an angel of mercy .... T_T 
I've paid my dues for today , now it's my time to veg in my chair in all my sickly misery ... 
Don't you just HATE it when you want to watch an old movie from your childhood and you don't own it ? T_T 
Can someone just remove my defective lungs for me ? Kthx . 
This whole ' laying low ' thing is really freaking boring ... Can't i just go to bed so i can see my boy ? 
Do any of us really know everybody on our friend list ? Here is a task for you . I want all my Facebook friends to comment on this status about how you met me . After you comment , copy this to your status so I can do the same . You will be amazed at the results you get in 12 hours 
I just had a great day with < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Malliet Sullivan and Ahdiij'a Guira , good food and great company . :) 
I feel so incredibly loved ... <3 
gahhhhhhh ... why is this freaking essay so hard to write ???! 
Kentucky just passed the best law ever . To be on Food Stamps , or to receive Medicaid or Cash Assistance for your children or yourself , you have to pass a drug test . Every other state should do the same . If you agree re-post . There are people who work who have to take drug tests , people on assistance should also be tested . Please copy and paste to your status if you agree ! 
My cat , < PROPFEMALE > , is such a bitch ... I get up to get a drink , and she waits until \ 
i'm two feet from my seat to lay down in my spot . 
i'm being a bad girl ... * secretly noms on starbursts * 
I'm getting REAL sick of folks making decisions for me , just because I have diabetes ... That doesn't make me an invalid ! * grinds teeth * 
NOM NOM NOM NOM ! 
I'm fearing for my shoulder from the cannibalistic pigeon ... >_> 
25 days till my birthday . < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Malliet Sullivan is taking me to Vampire's Masquerade Ball PDX 
I'm broke , frustrated , confused , and conflicted ... I really hate not having a job . 
Holy crap , I've lost 20 pounds ... O_O 
Funny how once I decide to cut out junk food and become healthier , I suddenly get an epic craving for potatoes ... 
Batman marathon and soup : sounds like a good night to me .. 
23 days till my birthday ! woo ! 
Read tarot cards and made/ate spaghetti with < PROPFEMALE > Nystrom tonight , it was fun . Seeing the boy in the morning . :) 
If you have a wonderful man , who helps balance your whole world . Who isn't perfect , but is perfect for you . Who works hard and would do anything for you . Who makes you laugh and drives you crazy , who is your best friend , who you want to grow old with , and who you are thankful for everyday , and who you could not live without . Brag on him a little and repost this as your status ! 
Tonight was stressful , tomorrow's gonna be stressful , and the next nine to twelve months aren't looking much better , but at least I know without a doubt in my mind that I have the love and support of a good man . <3 
It's kinda lost and confused , but the love of a good man is helping it through ... and it's RED ! 
Ergh . 
I just tried on my old prom dress for the Vampire's Masquerade Ball PDX and it still fits ! ^_^ 
T_T 
I made some great soup for two of my besties , < PROPFEMALE > Wisniewski and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Savage 
Heading to Catey Day's soon . :) 
16 days till my birthday ... :) 
Alright facebook , I'm admitting defeat and heading to bed . You win sleep . Night all . 
going to Claim Jumper's tonight with < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Malliet Sullivan and < PROPFEMALE > Nystrom for < PROPFEMALE>'s birthday . Suuuper excited , it makes getting up at this ungodly hour worth it . Nom nom nom nom ... :D 
I'm not dead ! I'm alive and well ! I crashed at < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Malliet Sullivan and I just forgot to tell my mom ... I'm fine . sorry I worried people . 
Yeeeeesh , is any one else getting the epic flood-like-rainfall at their place ? I feel uneasy just having my back to the front window with the roar of the water . 
Spaghetti ... nom nom nom ... 
I know better than to watch shows like this , but ... i wanna watch it ... I'm never gonna sleep tonight .... 
I've discovered a new found love affair with pasta ... I think my Italian genes are finally coming into play . 
woke up feeling nauseated and too hot ... taking some insulin and drinking water ... don't worry though , i'm staying up in case my sugars decide to plummet . 
Is it Wednesday yet ? 
Again , I feel a < PROPFEMALE > bit nauseous ... What is up with my stomach lately ? > ( 
Effing snow ! Why couldn't it have happened tomorrow and been useful ?! >_< I want to see my boy , dammit ! 
6 days till my birthday . :) 
I went clothes shopping with my mom for my birthday ( in 5 days ) and I must say that all-day shop-a-thons are NOT for the faint of heart . I'm BEAT ! But I got a lot of cute stuff ... ;) 
Me thinks I might do some hardcore cleaning and try my hand at cake baking ... O_O Wish me luck ! 
* grumble * i love how the people in my house always lecture me about cleaning up after my self in the kitchen after I cook something .. Now , when I wanna make something , I'll have to spend an hour cleaning up THEIR messes when I haven't cooked anything in a week . Can anyone say \Double-Standard\ " ? >_<" 
Lmao ! My cats are so deprived , they're practically laying on top of one another just to be in the the sunniest spot in the room ... 
After bitching about making a cake and cleaning up to make said cake , all I want to make is soup again . ^_^ ; Maybe I'll make cake tomorrow ... Anyone wanna come over tomorrow and help me ? 
belly full of soup and a < PROPFIRST>'s hard black < PROPFEMALE > lemonade ... yeah .. life does not suck right now . 
Anyone want to come over and make some birthday cake with me ? 
Well the cake is in the oven .. I hope it turns out okay , I kinda put twice as much vanilla extract as the recipe called for and added cinnamon ... Here's hopin ! 
SUCCESS ! the cake is delicious ! ^_^ 
54 hours till my birthday . :) 
Just got back from seeing HP7 Pt 1 ... I think I overdid it ... Feeling crummier than before ... =/ 
Heading to bed , Facebookers . Less than 48 hours till my birthday . :) 
There better not be any snow tomorrow ... I so do not want to be snowed in on my 21st birthday ! >_< 
My birthday went well , thought I only had one drink . Thanks everyone for the fond wishes ! 
Sunshine and snow .... wtf .... 
tried a new recipe for soup tonight ... so beyond full . 
my cat is a complete brat . he keep getting himself stuck behind the tv stand , just so that i'll save him ..... >:( 
=^_^= I <3 my life and everyone in it . 
Thinking about my sleep study ... Getting steadily more nervous about it as it looms closer and closer .... =/ 
Went to see Due Date with < PROPFEMALE > Wisniewski , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Savage , Lizzy Swanson , and < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Proctor . Movie wasn't really my style , but the french bulldog < PROPFEMALE > was great , as well as the company . :) 
Rrrgh ... I hate choosing classes ... Damned if I do , damned if I don't ... >_< 
< PROPFEMALE > Grape 
I think my first choices for classes are going to be filled up before I can sign up for them ... Time for the wait-list and making back-up plans ... =/ 
Bit of a hit and miss with < PROPFEMALE > Town tonight , but I had some good company with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Savage and < PROPFEMALE > Larson . The Women in History Show was great though , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Onstead , < PROPFEMALE > Hopkins , and Lizzy Swanson , you all were fantastic ! ^_^ 
Describe me using one word !! - post this as Your status and see what people comment 
I got my gloves , scarf , and choker today ! And I spent a wonderfully relaxing day with my boy . * Happy dance * 
I LIIIIVE ! 
< PROPFEMALE > Fried Rice from Talay Thai ... I think I love you . <3 
How did we meet and what is a good memory we have . Copy this to your status and see what people say . 
Okay , for the record , if there is ever a ring of power , DO NOT give it to me . ;) 
the squirrels in my backyard are cheeky .. they like to taunt my cats . 
i have a parrot cat ... 
The Girl you just called fat , she has been starving herself & has lost over 30lbs . The Boy you just called stupid , he has a learning disability & studies over 4hrs a night . The Girl you just called ugly , spends hours putting makeup on hoping people will like her . The Boy you just tripped , he is abused enough at home . There's a lot more to people than you think . Put this as your status if you are against bullying . 
I am 21 year old . I am an adult . If getting a job and moving out is what it takes for my over-protective mother to acknowledge that , then so be it . I am done being treated like a child . 
I'm running on empty here ... I can't focus on this essay to save my life , or to save my grade , for that matter ... I think it's best if i went to bed for now and give it my best shot in the morning ... ugh ... 
i'm ready for summer ... i wanna go camping , eat smores , and be hypnotized by the fire . 
I <3 garlic 
I just LOVE it when I'm getting really into my food and then CHOMP , there goes my tongue , being in the wrong place at the wrong time .... 
Spending the week with my boy , we have sooo many fun things planned , I can't wait ! ^_^ 
Sigh ... 
I know i should be cooking or cleaning or something productive ... but all i can manage right now is to shovel more potato chips into my maw .. 
Brrrrrrrr ! 
Why ? Whhhhhhhy ?! Why are they making ANOTHER Scream movie ??? LET THE FRANCHISE DIE ! 
Watching < PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland whilst we wait for dinner to be ready . I'm having a fantastic time on my stay-cation . ^_^ 
So .. No Masquerade Ball for me ... Financial complications .. Oh well , there's always next year . 
YOU DON'T LOOK SICK ?!? No , I don't . It's hard to explain to someone when they have no clue . It's a daily struggle feeling sick on the inside while you look fine on the outside . Please put this as your status for at least 1 hour if you or someone you know has an invisible illness . ( Anxiety , P.T.S.D. , Lupus , Fibromyalgia , Chronic Fatigue , Diabetes , Crohns , Arthritis , Menieres , IBS , Epilepsy , MS , Depression etc . ) 
This cold sure moved fast , first a stuffy nose to BAM , full attack on my system , in one night . Someone bring me soup , or the ingredients to make soup , please ?

Sometimes I miss them ... When I actually allow my self to think of them ... I wish they could've stayed around a few years longer , maybe everything wouldn't be as messed up as it is now if they had lived just a couple more years ... I miss you Aunt < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > . I hope you both are at peace .

Can't sleep , clowns will eat me !!! :( 
So no culinary program this year for me , so it'll be math all year whilist I save money for tuition ... Maybe a drawing class or something as well ? I'm not sure . 
We all have at least 60 friends on Facebook ; but when it comes to needing someone to talk to , how many will actually be there for you ? I can guarantee you , not even 15 of your Facebook friends will like this status . If you would be there for me , set this as your status & see how many of us are there for you !!!

With the feeling of heading off to the gallows , I now attempt to study the life-sucking < PROPMALE > of mathematics for the next two hours . Wish me luck . T_T 
Duhr ... 
I had a fun day of making/eating soup and watching Twilight : Eclipse and The Cat Returns with < PROPFEMALE > VanHoose . Now , off to make chocolate chocolate chip cookies and work on my homework ! 
Cookies are in the oven . <3

Just finished watching Porcco Rosso with my boy . It has been a good day . 
I love my cats dearly , but I really don't like them one < PROPFEMALE > bit right now . Not when I find my entire bed covered in up-chuck . This is NOT going to be a good day , I can tell already . >_< 
So I tried an experiment today , substituting oil for butter in cookies ... it worked /okay/ , but the cookies lack the richness of the first batch . =/ 
I feel popular . All the stray cats in my neighborhood love me . Lol 
I don't have to be awake for another 2 hours ... So why the hell am I ? >_< 
Is at the boy's place . <3 
Job hunting is epically discouraging right now ... Maybe putting some volunteer work on my craptastic resume will make me look more desirable to employers ...? Anyone know of any volunteer work ? 
mom shouldn't have left these cookies out in the open .... the cookie monster has nothing on me 
There are some days where you need to turn off the world , cook some good food , and share it with people you care for . Whatever happens , happens . 
Needy cat is needy ! O_o 
I know it all to well .. Depression is not a sign of weakness , it is a sign that you have been trying to be strong for too long . Put this as your status and leave it there for an hour , if you know someone who has or has had depression . Most people won't , but it's Depression Awareness Week and 1 in 5 of us will suffer at some point in our lives . Show your support . I copied and pasted , will you ... 
lol .... mom closed her bedroom door and ( my cat ) zeek was at her door , crying like the most pitiful creature on earth for the last 10 minutes .... i hear mom move upstairs , the door opens and slams shut ... 
Going to make soup . woot . 
I'm having the strange urge to go to the beach ... 
Warm belly full of soup , nice cold diet soda ... In the words of < PROPMALE > Bourdain : \Life does not suck right now . \"" 
I hate people sometimes ... What kind of sick bastard would just abandon an animal like that ??? This sweet , sweet stray is just breaking my heart ... He wants to come inside so badly , he even climbed up on to my lap , purring and headbutting my hands and arms ... I can't stop crying ... 
< PROPFIRST > horse went from my calf to my foot .. hurt like a biiiiiitch ! 
Just played DBZ DnD with my boy and < PROPFIRST > Kloss . +a google nerdiness . But you all knew that , right ? I revel in my nerdiness . Muahaha . Ha .. Ah ha .

Clean up the kitchen , laundry , clean up room , laundry , study my anatomy and physiology cards , laundry , practice energy work , LAUNDRY , walk Koby , make dinner ... I'm gonna make the most of today ! Go productivity ! RAWR ! 
Another health issue , this time it's a complete mystery , no one knows the cause or the cure ... ugh ... 
Math Basics and Med Terminology for fall quarter . Brain , prepared to be fried ... :P 
Walked the dog , did the dishes , cleaned up < PROPFEMALE>'s mess in my room , and now i'm studying my med terms . I think today's been pretty productive so far .

Ah , I feel like a giant goober but I'm really excited for Twilight : Breaking < PROPFEMALE > ... n_n 
One thing I did NOT miss about summer time ... Screaming children in my neighborhood ... I know I sound like a bitchy old lady when I say this but it sounds like someone is trying to murder them , seriously . 
My brother's 6 lb cat just had a stare down with a 20lb raccoon ... and after it turned to leave , she tried to < PROPMALE > after it , luckily i snatched the ballsy creature from the jaws of death .... scared me half to death ! 
It food like < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST>'s < PROPFEMALE > peppers and beef that makes me happy to be a carnivore . ^vv^ 
Facebook is the new portable battlefield . Don't like someone ? Delete them ( that'll show them ! ) . Pissed at someone ? Tell the world ( just not the person ) . Yes , this was inspired by recent events . No , it's not just directed at one person . 
When you pour milk on you cereal , is the milk to be condsidered a broth , a beverage , or a sauce ? 
My mind was officially blown by tonight's doctor who ...

* dies * I think I've found the perfect job for me ... Now I just have to wow them with my winsome personality and charm . 
Registered for Self Defense class for summer quarter . Not exactly my first choice in summer plans , but it'll keep me busy and give me my bus pass . 
I hate raccoons ... 
We all have at least 60 friends on Facebook ; but when it comes to needing someone to talk to , how many would actually be there for you ? I can guarantee not even 1 of your Facebook friends will copy this status . If you would be there for me , set this as your status & see how many of us would be there for you !

\Holding resentment is like drinking poison and waiting for the other person to die . \"" 
the net is kinda scary ... I'm looking up winter wedding stuff for my friend's wedding on google and now my facebook has ads for winter wedding stuff ... 
Well ... Shit ... I'm bored as hell . Maybe I'll go start up on my staggering tower of books I have yet to read ... Start by finishing The < PROPFEMALE > Spyglass , then move on to the last two books of The Vampire Academy , then The Vampire Diaries . So those of you who have loaned me books will hopefully be getting those back soon ! n_n ;; 
I had a great time at < PROPFEMALE > Wisniewski's place last night , with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Savage . Pizza , wine coolers , ice cream and movies . I didn't go to sleep till 5:50 AM , but I had fun . :)

Rrrgh ... Hypocrite ... 
The new < PROPMALE > Potter trailer just gave me goosebumps ...

I got a B+ in Creative Writing . :) 
Why does everyone hate the grape ( flavored soda) ? .... Oh well , more for me ? :)

Hmm ... I really didn't realize how much I really suck at keeping things to my self ... Lol . But as a test for my self I will keep my resolve until Mystery Project X is completed . ;) 
The raccoon has a family ... 4 rolly-polly cute little vicious babies ... =/ 
Funny how after I have a dream where I help slay a dragon , I feel like I've been run over by a Semi-Truck . 
Yoga from 10:00 - 11:00 AM , Monday through Friday here I come . 
Blah ... 
there's something so soothing about summer rain ... 
They're here ! My cards finally came ! n_n 
Feeling a little lonely these days ... =/ 
I was feeling rather zen after yoga today , until some tendons in my right arm started protesting loudly ... Maybe one too many downward-dog poses for me ? Hope it's not anything serious ... 
I'm gonna take a break from Facebook for a while- If anyone needs me , feel free to drop me a line by phone or email . 
is feeling like she needs an epic change in her life ... But what ? 
What is it about hot weather that makes pets want to suddenly cuddle ? 
Pretty nice day . Had a nice nap under the oak tree at < PROPMALE > , but now I'm melting in my room . 
Words cannot describe how much this is utter and complete bullshit ... 
On December 25th , 2012 Facebook will start charging you for your account . But if you get naked , stand on your dining room table , do the Macarena while singing '' I Will Survive '' , then , & only then , will < PROPFIRST > Depp will come down your chimney to tell you that your account will stay free . Paste this to your walls or YOU will be transformed into a goblin .... :) 
ice cream and mindless cgi violence heals all wounds . :) 
What has two thumbs and is beginning to despise facebook ? This chick . 
Peaches : One of few things that make summer tolerable . 
Family isn't always blood . It's the people in your life who want you\

Just two more weeks of yoga , then I can have a free schedule again . Now if only I had some people to < PROPFEMALE > out with until then ... 
For I am < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > of Cretins . All lesser cretins bow before me . 
Cleaned for about 40 minutes , played with Koby , took another shower because i then smelled of dog , and now I'm defending my ice cream from a pretty boy cat .. Going out to dinner soon . Take that crappy start to the day ! 
Pleasantly full after my dinner with < PROPFEMALE > Prishchenko . It was great catching up after all these years . :) 
I don't often use the phrase \douchebag\ " but I think I'll make an exception this time ... >_<" 
Had dinner and watched Source Code with < PROPFEMALE > Wisniewski tonight , then we laughed while reading Miss Manners's Guide to Excruciatingly Good Behavior . Good times . :P 
Watching Mork & < PROPFEMALE > with < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Malliet Sullivan . :) 
Didn't fall asleep till after 5 , got up at 11:30 , nearly fell asleep on my feet while grocery shopping , now waiting for my sugar free energy drink to kick in , and I think I'm getting sick . Poo . :( 
* Grumble * >_< 
FML . 
Watching Inuysha from the beginning and Inuyasha just used the phrase \Hella-Nasty\ " .... I think I just lost a little respect for this show ... -_-" 
Oh , Craiglist , you never cease to shock and horrify me ... 
:( My grandpa is in the hospital again ... send your positive thoughts/ prayers his way folks , I think this might be it .. 
The more I read about them , the more I can't wait to get a Bulldog of my own . <3

Heeey ... Could somebody nominate me for Rupaul's Drag U ?... Please ? 
Rrrgh ... I have this radiating pain coming from my ankle upwards till it hits my knee , no position is comfortable ... I reeeeally hope I didn't sprain it somehow ... 
Hobble around long enough to make spicy < PROPMALE > with chicken apple sausage and broccoli . but now my ankle hurts more ... =/ 
going up the stairs on your butt without your right ankle should be an Olympic sport ... 
I <3 broccoli . That is all . 
normal cats will try to steal some meat , fish , or cream from you , but not my cat , my cat tries to steal my plain crackers ...

Just had a bit of a career/identity crisis . Again . But this time I was with < PROPFIRST > Sullivan when it happened and after a few frustrated tears , my boy cheered me up and bolstered my drive to < PROPMALE > my dreams . I CAN get through my program and I CAN get a job . Just watch me ! 
Say you're a super hero . Here are the rules .. Go to your profile and look at your friends on the left side . \ 
First person is your sidekick : Lizzy Swanson\ 
Second person tries to expose your identity : < PROPFEMALE > Clevenger\ 
Third person is your teammate : Sariah Biere\ 
Fourth person is your arch nemesis : < PROPFEMALE > Bourke\ 
Fifth person is your love interest : < PROPFIRST > Sullivan 
Not just one but two rejections for jobs first thing when I wake up ... This is gonna be a GOOD day ... * insert scathing sarcasm here * 
I keep dreaming that I get a second dog , an American Pit Bull Terrier black lab mix , once it was a boy named Cooper , this time a girl named < PROPFEMALE > . Maybe I'll be getting a pup sometime soon ? Lol . :P 
Anyone know of places that are hiring ? 
My goal for the next few days is to clean up my room , it's slowly but surely turning back into the black hole again ... * Resolve face * 
Downloading The Beatles greatest hits CD : Very good idea . Taking an eager bite of my hot bagelful : Very bad idea . 
Question for my friends with kids or want kids someday : what would you do if your future hypothetical daughter at age 15 , starting asking for birth control ? 
< PROPFEMALE > alert ... Vancouver : little girl , 3 yrs old . Picked up by a man driving a gray car , license plate : quebec 723 381 . Canada . Please post this asap . The kidnapping is very recent , 3 seconds could save her life . If it were ur child u would want the same support ! 
Feeling incredibly discouraged ... Need a job to get a car , need a car to get a job ... 
Hm .. 2011 . Still with my boyfriend . Lost a friend . Made a few new goals . Read a few books . Not much new . 
Just made an obscene amount of Pasta Fagioli ( Tomato based bean , noodle , and hamburger soup ) from scratch with no recipe . Feeling a bit better about my self now . 
This is ridiculous , I shouldn't be having to defend my cheetos from my cat ... 
Just had my first game of scrabble with spaghetti at my boy's house tonight . I came in second . :P 
Life kinda sucks right now . >_< 
When will this crazy merry-go-round of excitement ever end ..?! * Insert scathing sarcasm here * 
Not going to < PROPMALE > this fall .. I'm gonna take this time to figure out wtf is wrong in my life ... Wish me luck , guys . =/ 
What has two thumbs and has a job interview on Wednesday ?? THIS CHICK !!! 
I think the interview went well , here's hoping I get a call back monday ! :) 
This quote from Lord of the Rings describes my experience < PROPFIRST > picking this morning with my dad and step-mom in the mountains : \What do they eat when they can't get hobbit ?! \ " Except it was \ " What do they eat when they can't get Travis ?! \ " Seriously . Swarming with bugs . " 
Is done with sunburns , bring on autumn ! 
Helluva day ... Love ya < PROPFIRST > , Kelso and Hide . 
Friends are like panties .... Some crawl up your butt . Some snap under pressure . Some don't have the strength to hold you up . Some get a little twisted . Some are your favorite . Some are holey . Some are cheap . Some are naughty . And some actually cover your butt when you need them to . Re-post this for all the friends you know and love , give them a laugh today :) 
Sigh ... No job for < PROPFEMALE > ... :( 
Knowing your calling in life is great , but it's also knowing that your calling isn't a feasible option that's the real kicker . FML . 
Disappearing for a few days . 
the whole assigned job thing from the book The Giver is sounding pretty good right about now ... 
\What the effing crap ? That angel guy just felt me up . \"" 
Getting attacked by big moths , not fun ... I screamed like a little girl ... 
Woke up to nausea this morning , finally fell back asleep , only to have my boy kiss me awake later . <3 him . 
< PROPFIRST > Sullivan loves me . He bought me soda and chocolate . <3 
Watching Father of the Bride and Father of the Bride II , making me feel all wishful for a wedding and a family of my own someday ... Stupid hormones ... Sigh . 
Every woman deserves a man who calls her baby , kisses her like he means it , holds her tight like he never wants to let go , doesn't cheat , wipes her tears when she cries , doesn’t make her jealous of other women , instead makes other women jealous of her , is not scared to let his friends know how he really feels about her , and lets her know how much he really loves her .... repost if you agree or if you're lucky enough to already have this . 
My cat is hyper ... I'm fearing for the welfare of my skin ... 
In the words of Donkey : \I think I need a hug ... \"" 
Putting off my anxieties for another time , here's hoping tomorrow is a better day . Night Facebook . 
Is going to be pretty damn lonely for the next week or two . Brother is in California , mother is at work , boyfriend is at Gresham , and I am without a buss pass ... :/ Let's see how many books I can read in this next week . First off , Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy . 
The heat is zapping my energy ... 
Rrrgh ... Why can't it be Tuesday already ?? > [ 
Oh popcorn , I forgot how much I love you . 
Funny how you can find something one day , but the second you need it , it vanishes off the face of the earth . 
Just two more days of restlessness before I can start to move forward , until then , study , laundry , study , clean room , study , avoid the sun , study , try sound grounding exercises , and did I mention study ? 
I am incredibly dumb ... 
.... Diabetes . . . I am asking if everyone could put this as their status for 1 hour . I'm pretty sure I know the ones that will . Think of someone you know or a loved one who has or had diabetes . My wish is that in 2011 a cure will be found . Will you post it for 1 hour . To honor those who have fought or are fighting diabetes . Can't wait to see who will re-post . Here's to all my family members who battle this disease everyday . 
so i went to < PROPMALE > to check out the I-BEST CNA thing this afternoon , waited two and a half hours just to be told that the people I need to talk to aren't even on the main campus , which they could've told me outright when I got there , so we drove to the town center < PROPMALE > college branch a few < PROPMALE > away only to be told that I had JUST missed the orientation for this week . but I was directed to one of the program leaders to ask questions and get me started on the admissions paperwork . 
Too much stress in this house ... Wish I had the money to take mom on a REAL vacation ... :( 
Finally moving forward . :D 
UGH ... Apparently my name was called for the 105.1 The Buzz Freeloader contest this morning , but I didn't know till 7 ' o clock this evening ... LAME ... D:

So I bring out a bowl of food for ( YET ANOTHER ) stray in the neighborhood and it keeps meowing at me and rubbing on me , like it was attention , but kinda growls at me if I touch it . Like it's not happy ' less it has something to complain about . * Sigh * Cats are very strange ... 
To my Facebook friends : Where were you on 9/11 ? 
< PROPFIRST > Sullivan is drawing another picture of me ... I feel self conscious . Lol . >_> <_< >_> 
So for the first time since elementary school , I had my hair french braided . I LOVE the aftermath , my hair is so curly , I love it ! :P 
* Twitch * I'm done . Seriously . I refuse to watch Hell's Kitchen anymore ... Every week , EVERY WEEK < PROPFEMALE > is up for elimination and she SKATES BY EVERY TIME ! * Scream of rage * 
I'm honestly considering getting a perm now , I love the curly look on me . 
Is super nervous about the test tomorrow ... :/ 
Tail set firmly between my legs , I have returned home , unsuccessful . I ended up getting lost on my way to the place where the test was being held and came home . Sigh ... Drowning my sorrows in diet soda now ... Trying again next week though . 
Heading out to lunch at Talay Thai with < PROPFEMALE > Doesntlikefb . :) 
< PROPFIRST > Bieber ... Has a doll ... I have nothing against him as a person , I'm just not a big fan of his music ... But seriously ? A doll ? ... My head hurts now ... 
I feel very proud of my self , I found someone's lost < PROPFEMALE > . It's nice to know that he wasn't abandoned , only lost . 
There's nothing quite like stomping on a nice crunchy autumn leaf . :D 
OMFG ... My mom just attempted to beatbox .... I haven't laughed that hard in weeks ... my stomach ... 
Trying very hard to remain calm today ... It's not as easy as it sounds with present company about ... >_< 
I love it when I wake up and my bed-head looks fabulous . :P 
Studying for my test on Monday with Pandora set to their symphonic station . Wish me luck . :D 
It's finally soup weather , I'm gonna try out a new one : Pea soup with Garlic . 
The pea soup turned out great ! It was a super quick recipe too . :) 
I think this evening took a few years off my life ... :( 
someone be an angel of mercy and get me some < PROPFEMALE > ale ? ... please ?

Rojo's Pico de Gallo All Natural Salsa is the best freaking salsa EVER . I've never had a salsa like it . 
Aw . I got a reward from the girl who's cat I found . I feel all warm and fuzzy now . :)

Starting my CNA program tomorrow and I just got my scrubs today . I'm psyched ! :D 
I forgot how much I loved Cookies and Cream ice cream ... <3 
I love how I can never sleep the night before the first day of class . Thank the gods for the miracle that is caffeine . I suppose it gives me more time to get ready ... 
It's hard to explain to someone who has no clue . It's a daily struggle being in pain or feeling sick on the inside while you look fine on the outside . Please put this as your status for at least 1 hour if you or someone you know has an invisible illness ( PTSD , Anxiety , Bipolar , Depression , Diabetes , LUPUS , fibromyalgia , MS , ME , Arthritis , Cancer , Heart Disease , Epilepsy , Migraines , Autism , M.D. etc . ) \Never judge what you don't understand \"." 
Made it through my first day , and quickly realized I in no way shape or form had the right type of supplies for class , so after braving the GINORMOUS line at the < PROPMALE > bookstore to get my bus pass , mom and I went to get me better supplies . I now feel fully equipped to take on NAC 103 ! I'm now gonna go study hand-washing and bed making techniques ! RAWR !!! 
Got my ( HUGE ) watch and jump drive for class . I think I ( FINALLY ) have all my supplies . 
Went shopping with mom and I'm getting my hair done Saturday before the Movie Night at < PROPFEMALE > Wisniewski's . :) 
< PROPFEMALE > is snoring in my ear ... it's cute . 
This movie , And the Band Played , on is seriously messing with my emotional equilibrium ... Thank you SO MUCH for requiring me to watch this , NAC class ... D: 
On this day , September 30th , in 2004 , breast cancer stole the life of my Auntie < PROPFEMALE > . Years later she is still missed and remembered . I want to ask you , my friends , that starting from today till the 7th , to make your profile picture the color pink for breast cancer awareness . I'd really appreciate it . 
Made it through my first week of NAC , only 7 more to go ! 
Yanno , some of the best stories of all time could be written , by me , if only they weren't lost the second I woke up ... >_< 
Had a great time watching Zookeeper and going to Coldstone with < PROPFEMALE > Wisniewski and Lizzy Swanson . :) 
Still kinda torn between utter bewilderment and shock , but the adrenaline has finally faded a bit ... But still , have to laugh at \NOOOOOO ! I DON'T WANT TO BE A WAITER ! \"" 
Just helped my brother make some beef chow fun in the rain outside . It's yummy . :) 
Just realized that people will most likely be trying to touch my diabetic tootsies tomorrow and my initial gut reaction is \LIKE HELL YOU ARE ! \"" 
I'm allergic to math ... Cough , cough ... Me thinks this next module in my class is going to be the death of me ... :/ 
Going to watch Repo ! The Genetic Opera before I settle down for the night . :) 
It's official . It's cold enough to require gloves/mittens to go outside . Fall is finally here . 
I'm covered in cats , it must be cold . :P 
.... I hate when I read so quickly that I have to wait for my comics to update ... >_< 
Making dinner with the boy ( < PROPFIRST > Sullivan ) . \Don't leave her with the mashed potatoes- OR YOU WILL NOT GET ANY ! \"" 
Hi . My name is < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > and I am a nerd . I'm learning how to play ( REAL ) Dungeons and Dragons from my boyfriend . XD 
Rain + comfy bed + flannel sheets + WARM boy + cuddling = nap time . 
Is impatiently waiting for this legendary banana cream pie at my boy's house ... 
You would think that I had been gone for months instead of a few days , the way my cat is acting . I feel loved . Lol . 
< PROPFEMALE > ... I think after 3 years of great service in my hands , and gods know how many years in it's previous owner's , my phone is finally crapping out on me . As in , dying , kaput , game over , no more .... And guess who is too broke to buy a new one ? >_< 
LMAO ! Koby ( my dog ) just jumped on to the recliner with my mom ! 
I got a 100% on my first Module Exam today ! My issues with my phone made that fact completely slip my mind till now .
