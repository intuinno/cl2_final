Pacers fans get your ass downtown 
I feel like I'm in chitown right now , bulls fans outnumber pacers fans 2-1 
this pacer team will be a force in 2 yrs ... but they will get swept today 
< PROPMALE > is even uglier in person than on tv 
for being a 1 vs 8 game these 2 teams really don't like each other 
that pretty boy fuck is fucking lethal 
I hate chicago fans 
bulls fans haven't figured out that this is a 1 vs 8 matchup , best record in the playoffs vs the worst record in the playoffs , d < PROPFEMALE > vs no all-sstar , they are supposed to kick our ass ... yet they've had to rally in every game ... 
and chicago fans are showing their fairweather colors 
the bulls can't sweep the pacers , and has had to rally in every game so far , that's gonna suck for all you chicagoians when you play teams that actually has a winning record and allstars 
the pacers are goin to be a force over the next couple years if they keep this group intact 
the club can't even handle me right now

2 hrs until the world as we know it is engulfed by the gates of hell ... luckily ill be in meijer and it will be a seemless transition 
just got done spending another friday night in richmond chain stores lugging boxes and as I'm pulling outa meijer a blatantly drunk bastard almost hits me ... all I can say is that he better have been drinking patron or < PROPFIRST > 
I'm gonna be really pissed if the world ends today since that means I would've spent my last night on earth preparing for work on Monday 
I love it when you call me big papa 
< PROPFEMALE > is a bitch on day 1 
ganassi is running 2 and 3 that team is going to be hard to beat ... it must suck to be a driver at ims not named dixon or franchitti 
\if I ever had any < PROPFEMALE > to be a team owner today cured it\ " - < PROPFIRST > Andretti " 
great first day of quals ... tagliani and < PROPFIRST > schmidt are on the pole , penske is in the middle of the pack and ganassi has 2 drivers in top 9 ... awesome day where the ghosts of ims have passed correct judgement 
I feel bad for the people who legitimately believed the rapture was going to happen today ... I really hope they are able to bounce back mentally and retain any possessions they might have given up 
Rain rain go away .... 
< PROPMALE > is still my favorite driver 
< PROPFEMALE > won't make the race that would be damn funny 
< PROPMALE > bumps < PROPMALE > reay ... crazy stuff ... but clutch driving by < PROPMALE > he's fun to watch 
ugh ill be glad when its friday 
thought of the day ... things between 2 people will never work out when your morals and values are diametrically different ... no matter what is going on one person deep down will be unhappy 
if your old get off the damn rd 
what I hate about sales is that I can work my ass off , do everything I need to , pitch left and right but if the money isn't there or the market for the product isn't there or the product itself isn't memorable I'm < PROPFIRST > and it looks like I'm not doin my job and I'm not getting paid 
never thought he was funny cause he screwed up 98% of the snl skits he was in but this is classic @jimmyfallon : No , your cat is not adorable . And unless you physically gave birth to it , please stop calling it your \baby \""
