well .. tonight was somewhat entertaining i guess ... ready for the weekend ... 
wishing has definitely not been successful for me so I might as well quit wishing and attack whatever is thrown at me ... but here's my one last wish , I wish people would just tell me what they don't like about me and confront me to my face instead of saying things to others ... I promise that I can take the heat ... but I know this will probably never happen 
likes blueberry-pomegranate gatorade :D 
.. sometimes in our lives , we all have pain , we all have sorrow ... but if we are wise , we know that there's always tomorrow ... :)

Always remember to slow down in life ; live , breathe , and learn ; take a look around you whenever you have time and never forget everything and every person that has the least place within your heart . 
Forgiving does not erase the bitter past . A healed memory is not a deleted memory . Instead , forgiving what we cannot forget creates a new way to remember . We change the memory of our past into a hope for our future . - < PROPFIRST > B . Smede 
And all , all , all of my light is for you .. And home , home's anywhere you are too . So take this one fallen man on his knees .. Saying please forgive me ... And I was on shakey land . Lost and unsure I opened my handAnd she held it like sinking sand 
gave the puppy a bath and just chilling to music :D 
only when you have found those people you can be completely insane around have you found your true friends :D 
is hoping it will storm :D :D :D

is singing ... Would you give it all up ? Could you give it all up ? If I promise boy to you . That I'll never talk again , and I'll never love again . I'll never write a song , won't even sing along , I'll never love again ... some men may follow me , but you choose \death and company . \ " Why you so speechless ? oh oh oh ... " 
\ ... But so many people are looking to me To be strong and to fight But Im just surviving I may be weak but Im never defeated And Ill keep believing In clouds with that sweet silver lining ... \"" 
sometimes ... you just can't help but wondering if things would be different if you were mute , deaf , or blind ... because then you wouldn't have to worry about people twisting your words , hearing them yell or hurt others , and you would never have to see those you care about in pain or things fade into black and white ... it's just one of those nights and moods :/ 
\ ... If you could read my mind You might see more of me than meets the eye And you've been all wrong Not who you think I am You've never given me a chance .. and you don't know how it feels To be your own best friend on the outside looking in .. \"" 
four big games of volleyball with relatives , hanging out , playing in the rain , and just talking ... had a fun day ! =]

home from orientation and had fun :) the Cardinals won ! now to listen to music and draw ... maybe ... not sure yet . if you want to chat just e-mail or text me :) 
.. I can climb through the clouds far away from my doubt , that would be so amazing . Feel the sun on my face , such a beautiful place , yeah I know that it's waiting . Skating safe ... encouraging with faith . Cuz hope has wings to < PROPFEMALE > you . Anything is possible . Just might be a miracle waiting to come true . So I lift my eyes and see the skies , feel my heart begin to fly . I will be carried by my dreams cuz hope has wings .. 
... Lost in a moment when it's only me and you . There is no other place I'd rather be but here , and those are only times that make the world disappear ... 
\Who is to say what is proper ? If it were proper to wear a codfish on your head would you do it ? \"" 
is feelin like a squirrel . Oh yeah , that's cause I am ! 
... I got more on my mind than I ever told , I got pain that you never felt . I got the scars , I can deal with it on my own . I've got stories that I'll never tell , but maybe it's just as well . Cause you don't know me , you don't wanna know it's real , and I'm not sorry for who I am for what I feel , cause you don't know me ... 
This girl has got stronger and if I knew then what I know now I would have told myself don't worry any longer it's OK ... ' cause a face without freckles is like a sky without stars . Why waste a second not loving who you are ? Those little imperfections make you beautiful , lovable , valuable , they show your personality inside your heart reflecting who you are . 
A < PROPFEMALE > for my thoughts , oh no I’ll sell them for a dollar . They're worth so much more after I’m a goner , and maybe then you’ll hear the words I been singin’ . Funny when you're dead how people start listenin’ ... 
almost finished with my presentation , pretty much packed up , shopping with my roommate on wednesday .... moving on thursday 
ready or not .... here i go ... 
listening to music , chilling with my super awesome roomie < PROPFEMALE > Cunningham , and messin around on facebook with the new laptop :) 
gona work on some more homework and then maybe watch a movie .... 
feels like i'm going to pass out :/ 
being sick isn't much fun at all ... :/ 
homework , studying , and music ... what a way to spend the weekend . 
And when the sky is falling , don't look outside the window . Step back and hear I'm calling . Give up , don't take the fast road . It's just your doubt that binds you . Just drop those thoughts behind you now . Change your mind . You let go too soon . 
I'm not your anchor , so don't hold on . I'm not the answer , you've got me wrong . I'm not your savior , save your energy . To find out who you are , yeah who you are without me . I'm not a mirror , look inside yourself . I'm not a hero , you know too well . I'm not your savio , save your energy 
So many things that I should say if it even mattered anyway . The war has long been lost to sad souls that can't count the cost . But love is just an open flame , we burn ourselves just to feel the pain , no . When is it over now ? 
And I just needed you to pick me up , like you did when we were younger . When the lightning and the thunder had me clinging to your heart . For someone to lift me up when I'm down and I'm forgotten . You'll forever be my father , and I'll be saving tears in jars for this one 
If God had a name , what would it be , and would you call it to his face . If you were faced with him in all his glory , what would you ask if you had just one question ... What if God was one of us , just a slob like one of us , just a stranger on the bus , trying to make his way home ... 
Today , I'm gonna try a little harder , gonna make every minute last longer . Gonna learn to forgive and forget , ' cause we don't have long , gonna make the most of it . Today , I'm gonna love my enemies , reach out to somebody who needs me . Make a change , make the world a better place , ' cause tomorrow could be one day too late 
is thinking \Ice cream and cake and cake . Ice cream and cake and cake . Ice cream and cake to the ice cream and cake . Ice cream and cake to the ice cream and cake ... \ " all thanks to < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > " 
is thinking I need to step out of my comfort zone and be more outgoing ... not really sure how to do that though .... anyone have suggestions ?? 
... Take me , this is all that I've got , this is all that I'm not , all that I'll ever be . I've got flaws , I've got faults keep searching for your heart . It doesn't matter who you are , we all have our scars ... 
is eating my juice box with a spoon because it is so cold ... chilling with < PROPFEMALE > Cunningham , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFIRST > Kean as we wait for our final ... 
... Run fast for your mother ; run fast for your father . Run for your children all your sisters and brothers . Leave all your love and your longing behind . You can't < PROPFEMALE > it with you if you want to survive . The dog days are over , the dog days are done . Can you hear the horses , ' cos here they come .... 
highlights of today .... read some of a book , started a puzzle , < PROPMALE > out with relatives , and pushed the yukon out of a rut with < PROPFIRST > Trisler , < PROPFIRST > Maher , and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Maher .... fun stuff . (: 
when you sit and find old cards and memories ... sometimes you can't help but think about what you had , miss the people you < PROPMALE > out with , and the pain you once felt then wonder why people change and if it is your fault that everything is different ... 
... Is there anybody out there ? Am I swimming through this empty sea alone ? Am I looking for an answer ? Or am I trying to find a way to get back home ? Is there anybody out there ? Would you hear me if I screamed or if I cried ? I am looking for an answer , and just trying to find a way to survive ... 
... I'm tired of sleeping , alone I've been grieving , the life that I gave up to feel alive , I want to feel alive ... 
I'm a paint brush in a way . I'm simple , yeah , I'm plain . I'm colored all the same . I have meaning if you find it in yourself ... 
Happiness damn near destroys you , breaks your faith to pieces on the floor . So you tell yourself , that’s enough for now ... Happiness has a violent roar ... 
The question I have is ... In a world full of conformists , do you take the easy way and succumb to what everyone wants you to be or do you take the toughest route and fight to be who you are and want to be ? This may be the greatest question I have for life and myself because either way I look at it , I can't help but wonder if you can truly be happy either way ... 
I knew this day would come to end , so let this life begin ... Why give up , why give in ? It's not enough , it never is so I will go on until the end . We've become desolate , it's not enough , it never is , but I will go on until the end ... 
Cause when you die , well you die , so just live how you please because we are all alive and we're free . Let not anyone claim forward thought paves mistakes cause they dressed us then left us alone ... 
... You've got to make a choice , if the music drowns you out , and raise your voice every single time they try and shut your mouth . Sing it for the boys , sing it for the girls , every time that you lose it sing it for the world . Sing it from the heart , sing it till you're nuts , sing it out for the ones that'll hate your guts . Sing it for the deaf , sing it for the blind , sing about everyone that you left behind ... 
This world is like a trampoline , high and low no in between . Jumping at the < PROPMALE > to please everyone but thats not me ... 
Sleep with one ear close to the ground and wake up screaming . When we lay our cold weapons down we'll wake up dreaming ... 
< PROPFEMALE > :) 
Dear chemistry , \ 
Once upon a time you were my favorite subject and I understood you . Now I still understand you , but I absolutely loathe you right now .... 
Who are you to tell me that I'm less than what I should be ? Who are you ? Who are you ? I don't need to listen to the list of things I should do . I won't try , no I won't try .
