Over 23,000 teachers were given pink slips in CA & 17,000 in IL . New Jersey & Florida are cutting teacher jobs & reducing salaries . Long Island teachers are being cut in nearly every district . We need to get our priorities in order . Athletes get paid millions , but teachers , who we trust to help raise & educate our kids , are losing their jobs . In honor of ALL teachers , copy & paste this into your status
