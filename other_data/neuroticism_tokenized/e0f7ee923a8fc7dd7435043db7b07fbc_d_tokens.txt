chillin out , thinking about s cute lil someone ..... 

what do u think ? 
i don't care 
blub blub , i am as clueless as a fish rite now and will probably get oin trouble , but i'll think about that l8r 
OMG , i am like so p'd off 
do we rly have any control ourselves , or are we puppets controlled by < PROPFEMALE > and wordly views ? 
hail to thos whon died on this day 
i kno who i am and u may try but u can't change me cuz i'm a threat 
doin homework , even tho i don't c why we must conform to doing such tedious things 
took a break from this retarded work 
Q : What is the point of preparing if in the future we r all 2 die ? A : Regardless of the end date , we must make life a moving target 
what is this world comign 2 ? am I the only optimistic person left ? 
everything around me is going so fast , i'm almost 14 for < PROPMALE>'s sake , and tings fall apart as they should , however , i find a way through the darkness . I am content , idk bout yall , but i'm happy 
I'm a rockstar . U all kno it , u just try 2 play it off 
in this world , u have 2 b strong . make it or break it 
so sad , 2 bad , but all good things have 2 come 2 an end . u may not like , but u DO have 2 deal with it 
watever u have 2 say 2 me , sayh it 2 my face . it makes u look that less of a coward 
y must i get out of bed and go through the day ? oh yea , that's rite , i am symbol of strentgh for the ones who can't and i'm 14 . what's ur excuse for complaining so ? 
what do i do to turn ? i merge now , good luck everybody else . family guy quote by a chinese lady in her car 
what r u looking at ? haven't u ever seen a girl snacking on chips before ? *looks down * oh these r leaves . still u have no rite 2 stare . hmph 
LOVIN LIFE , NOT 2 KRAZY OVER THE PPL I MEET THO . LOVE ME OR HATE ME , I DON'T CARE BUT REMEMBER THAT I CAN GO ON WITHOUT U 
back again and not going anywhere . so what r u gonna do about it ? embrace it or forget ? 
if love is power and power is everything , what does that make love ? Is it rly everything or nothing . it's ur choice 
who says nerds can't have fun . 2ay was a good day , a rl good day . actually , still hyper from it 
not meanin to down ppl , but what's so kool about the fair ? 
what's ur object in life ? 2 follow or to lead , u have to make it work 4 u and for the 1s u love the most . 
u only respect the threats . u disrespect the ones you fear or despise . u can do either , i will respond kindly 2 both reactions 
& ____________ should be in a relationship , i just wanna c what u guys think . idk , i'm bored 
2morrow is friday . r u as excited as i am ? 
goin trick or treating tomorrow and luvin it . who says i'm 2 old to go trick or treating . who doesn't like free < PROPFEMALE > ? and if i'm so old , then y is it that there are costumes for adults ? answer me that ^^ 
y can't ppl notice , notice the rl me instead of on the outside . so i'm a lil tomboyish . no need 2 judge me becuz of that . So what if i'm white on the inside and like japanese music . i'm me and that's never going 2 change . the reason is that they judge themselves 
soooo bored . :( i need something 2 do . but have u ever had that feeling where u wanna do something but it's all like u don't even feel like doing it ? 
going 2 ATLANTA tomorrow with a friend . don't worry , i kno u will all miss me so i'll still b on fb 
so mad < PROPMALE > Mccurry . he pissed me off . i don't wanna b mad at him but he just seriously ticked me off
