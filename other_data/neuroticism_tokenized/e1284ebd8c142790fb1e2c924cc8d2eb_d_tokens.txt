Look at energy leaks and where time and money are going that is not serving , building or giving back in satisfaction , prosperity or service . \ 
My question to you : If you imagine your relationship to money to be the equivalent of a relationship with a person , who is money to you ? What type of person are they and what is your energy relationship between one another ? How would you like that relationship to change ? 
I remember that I am not the sum of other people's emotions . :-)

The point I wish to make with this information is that the greatest way each of you can serve God , serve all mankind , serve the planet , and to serve yourselves is to create your lives as masterpieces of joy .

Live life as a masterpiece of JOY !

My personal Life Mission is to use Creativity as a tool for healing , teaching , & coaching . I do this by offering myself as a mirror to others & seeing in them a clear reflection of myself .

Balance isn't just about polarities . It's about oneness . 
Eat without guilt , consume with pleasure , restrict not Life . 
The most powerful words and phrases are those with a neutral charge around them yet with the deepest of meaning : Life , It Is , All , Breathe , Song , To Be ... Can you think of others ? 
Embrace the paradox . It is one and it is the sum of its parts . Therein lies the Balance .
