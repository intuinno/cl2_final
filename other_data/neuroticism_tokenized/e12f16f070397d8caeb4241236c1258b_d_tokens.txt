I LOVE INTERNATIONALS !!! 
Never on anymore !! But I'm sad cause our guests are leaving on Saturday ! And I am nervous to see what my parents got me for my birthday ; cause I was with them once they got it , but they took me to a different part of the store , and said now your dad is going to go get your birthday present .. so we have to stay here .. he buys it and hides it in the car ... \ 
and this happened like 4 months ago !! is this cruel ? 
Thanks everyone for the wonderful birthday wishes !! Love you all ! 
French chocolate if very scrumptious ! 
So today at basketball I got a bloody nose , jammed my finger , and felt sick the whole time .... ummm I knew this streak of not getting hurt was to good to be true ! I guess I am just a ball magnet in any sport I play .... But I am blaming the injuries on me not feeling good , so Thursday should be better , and I should get to start on SATURDAY !!! 
Sometimes you've got to dream a little bit bigger darling !! 
3 . ) \I spy bowtie with my pie !!!! \ " -ME !! "

Hey so I have all of the girls up , but I am still working on the guys picture ! So sorry but my dad took 502 photos its a lot of work to go through , if I don't have them up tonight they will be up tomorrow !

Most people have 1,000 wishes for Christmas ... A cancer patient only has one : to get better . I know 97% of you wont repost this to your status , but i hope you are the 3% that will . In honor of someone who has died , still fighting , or has survived cancer . Copy this to your status . God bless ! :) 
This morning I was making eggs for before my bball game , and then I tried to put a lil bit of pepper on it ! Well far did I know that the pepper container was unscrewed ! So I guess I just fail .... they were very peppery ! And this all happened before 9 , how nice ! 
We won by 1 , but really I think we could have done better ! The funniest part is when < PROPFEMALE > Knittel lost her shirt ! ( she found it a silly boy took it ! ) I can't wait for tomorrow to see grandpa up in < PROPFEMALE > Minnesota ! And see the snow and maybe ice fishing with the portable this year ! Plus I will get to relax ! Finally oh and I guess I should study too :( \ 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas to everyone !

Lord thank you for letting my live my life with amazing friends !! :D 
Lord I woke up just singing your praise and I want to keep singing your praise ! I love you Lord so much ! Please help me to be a light to this world , Lord I think we all need you now ! Thank you so much for sending your son for us ! And please help people remember that at this time of year its not about the presents ! Its about the ultimate gift that you have given us which is everlasting life ! Thank you Lord ! 
Lord thank you for blessing me with such great friends who know you !! And thank you for giving us the ultimate gift , your son Jesus ! Thank you Happy early birthday Christ ! 
Just finished wrapping presents ! 
Why do we sleep through church ? But stay awake for a 3 hour movie ? Why is it hard to pray ? But so easy to cuss ? Why is it so hard to repost a Godly bulletin but easy to repost the mean ones ? Why can people worship a celebrity but not God ? Gonna ignore this ? Afraid to get laughed at ? 80% of you won’t repost this . The Lord said If you deny me in front of your friends , I will deny you in front of my father . 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas < PROPFEMALE > everyone ! God bless you all ! :D 
Stuffed from my dad's Swedish meatballs ! And now ready to go to the Christmas < PROPFEMALE > service ! I can't wait to get my pajamas and head to bed ! < PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone ! And Happy Birthday Christ ! 
I believe that we should ALL enjoy Jesus ' Birthday ! Happy early birthday Christ ! I love you ! I love you all ! 
To look back and think that\ 
This baby would one day save me\ 
In the hope that what You did\ 
That you were born so I might live\ 
\ 
And I , I celebrate the day\ 
That You were born to die\ 
So I could one day pray for You to save my life\ 
Thank you Jesus for saving my life ! Happy Birthday ! 
So instead of going to ski trip I decided I should get sick ! Hmm not my idea of fun but what ever ! Tomorrow I should be fine ! Well I guess the Lord knew I would get hurt on Ski Trip so he didn't want me to go ! Thanks Lord I know you had a reason ! 
So < PROPFIRST > called me a nerd once I was mad that I missed 10 mins of NCIS ! Then I was mad cause it was already one that I saw !! :( Well I got a < PROPMALE > to watch the Vikings game ! :D
