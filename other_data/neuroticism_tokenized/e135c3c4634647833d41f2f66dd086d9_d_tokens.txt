Disneyland ... HERE WE COME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

does not want to be back from Disneyland . Boo Here ! 
I have no kids at home for the next 3.5 weeks . You would think I would be happier . 
wonders what happened to all the cleaning I was going to get done while Steph was at < PROPMALE > . 
is sad that her baby is miserable . I know she's miserable because today is the second day she's missing school . My po baby . 
Poverty sucks ! 
Mom's in the hospital ... it's been a long day . 
Mom's in rehab now ! Today she's exhausted from the big walk around the phys therapy room .... woo hoo , go mom ! 
Mom is back at the hospital . She had an extension of her original stroke . I'll keep everyone posted . 
is it possible to have transitional weather around here ? Redding has two seasons ... air conditioner or heater . 
RIP Capt . < PROPFIRST > ;-( It's a sad day . 
Happy Thanksgiving , Everyone ! Here's hoping for a fight-free family dinner .
