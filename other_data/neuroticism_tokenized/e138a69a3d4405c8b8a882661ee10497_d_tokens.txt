\Do not worry if you feel low ; the sun has a sinking spell every night

Knowledge is realizing that the street is one-way , wisdom is looking both directions anyway .? 
Ya know ... it just NEVER goes well when you step out of God's will . I wonder why we lie to ourselves and make it seem like it's all going to work out .? 
Woot woot ! I got my tickets to go see Big Daddy Weave !! I'm so excited !? 
I went to the GYM yesterday evening for the first time in my LIFE . We're planning to go again today . I'm not gonna like this ... it hurts !! lol ? 
Sooo ... I fixed baked chicken w/ roasted butternut squash , parsnips , and sweet potatoes for dinner ... was joking with < PROPFIRST > and told him I did 2 healthy things in one day and he should encourage me . With a mouthful of parsnip and a wrinkled nose he replied \Woo ... good job . Did you have to include me ? \ " lol ? " 
I've made it to the gym 4 days in a row ! Having a friend to go \ 
with sure helps keep up the motivation ! And we can already see a lot of\ 
improvement in endurance level . WTG < PROPFEMALE > !! :-) ? 
ARG ! The gym was closed today ! So , we measured the parking lot at the soccer field and walked laps there . AND we broke our record for \distance without dying\ " . There's no stopping us ! Hooaah ! ** rolling eyes at self ** lol ? " 
You'll notice that a turtle only makes progress when it sticks out its neck .? 
< PROPFEMALE > + alarm clock = Love/hate relationship . hmmmmm and now that I think of it ... that's how all of my \guy\ " relationships have been too !! Aahhh now I remember why I'm single !! :-P ? "

Criminy ! We went walking outside this evening . ' Bout got blown away and MAN that wind is cold ! Yep .. the gym would have been a better option today ! ? 
Aaaahhhhh the weekend begins ! :-)

Sometimes ya just gotta humble yourself , admit ya messed up big-time , ask forgiveness , and move ON . Yep ... I'm there . ( ouch ) 
Woot woot ! Goin ' to a Big Daddy Weave/Aaron Shust concert tonight . I'm sooo excited !! ?

I investigate and find that a toddler has escaped and is wandering around alone !! I knock on neighborhood doors for like 15 minutes and eventually find his home ... the mom yells at the little guy like it's HIS fault ! Arg !! What the BLEEP is wrong with people ?!?!?!? 
To all my friends and family , know I am thankful for each of you . Be sure to pause today and realllllly count blessings ... and give thanks to our God for allowing us such privileged lives . Love y'all!! ** hugs** ? 
All of the kids are gone . The house is quiet . I don't know what to do with myself ...? 
** sigh ** I give up ... 
** plotting alarm clock murder ** 
GRRRRRRR ! Out of coffee ... so I get dressed to go get some ... no car keys . Oh wait ... a kid had them last night and now they are not in my purse where they belong . I REALLY like it when things are where they BELONG . I don't think that's being OCD at all . ** grumpy face** ? 
Ok ... THAT walk was miserable ! :-( 
I declare today to be a day full of productivity and good cheer !! 
WOOT WOOT ! CHIEFS Wooooohoooooo !!! ** doin a celebratory dance ** 
Browsing thru \friends of friends\ " and finding old high school classmates . Nostalgia has set in ... I miss the good old days . And .. I'm totally envious of ( and glad for ! ) so many that I see got married and STAYED that way . :-) "

Today will be a better day . Today will be a better day . Today will be a better day . 
YAYYY !! Only 9 hours until I can let my brain rest for awhile . The ole ' gray mare just ain't what she used to be ! :-P

A real woman always keeps her house clean and organized ; the laundry basket is always empty . She's always well dressed , hair done . She never swears and behaves gracefully in all situations and under all circumstances . She has more than enough < PROPFEMALE > to take care of her family , always has a smile on her lips , and a kind word for everyone . Post this in your status if you too suspect that you might be a man . :-P 
I am a happy camper . :-) 
Death by tuna/noodle casserole ? Yep , just ask my kid . He's dying right now . lol 
True love is a friendship set on fire . 
Lord help me ! I got sucked back into a dog rescue . lol She was filthy , stinky , starving , scared half to death and covered with ticks . ( EWWWW !!! ) \ 
But now she has a full tummy , has been bathed , and is cuddled up on my couch in a blankey . Muuuuuchhh better . :-)
