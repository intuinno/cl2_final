I am Here . 

Thanx . < PROPFIRST > made me do it . 
You know its truly boring without < PROPMALE > . He's camping since thursday and I'm bored . < PROPFEMALE > is a handful usually , but now she's asking where's Daddy ? 
Everything is good . < PROPMALE > is back from camping and < PROPFEMALE > is a handful . She starts swimming soon . 
Cloe is going swimming today . I'm so excited . 
< PROPFEMALE > got the sniffles yesterday . No swimming . She is better today , but still congested . 
< PROPFEMALE > took jello I made last night and smeared it everywhere . She woke me up as a smurff . Some of you will laugh , but I'm not there yet . I'm pissed . Blue everywhere . Even the walls . What do I have to do really beat her this time . She doesn't listen . 
okay I've made red jello . Hopefully she won't be a horrorflick victim next time I see her . 
I really really dislike appliances . Or is it that they hate me . I mean really ! 
Now I'm sick . Now thats just not fair . 
Still sick . Never get sick . Then in the end of summer I feel yucky . < PROPFEMALE > , thank god , is all better . This would suck if we were sick at the same time . 
See that I am a Fire storm . 
I am so tired , but if I sleep during the day I can't sleep at night . I know I'm whinning , but when your sick isn't that the time to whine . I even have the whinny voice down perfectly 
< PROPFEMALE > went down for her nap like she was waiting for me to tell her it was nap time . She never does that . She fights sleep , like its her mortal enemy or something . 
Mortal enemy is back . Two hour fight to sleep . 
Almost all better . I feel like a person again . 
It really is so wierd to have no sense of smell . < PROPFEMALE > made a huge mess of smelly lotion and I cleaned it up with no problem . Litter boxes , throwing trash , no problem . The only done side is I don't smell the mess shes making and then its too late . 
Happy Labor Day ! Hope no one is actually laboring ! 
I know I complain a lot . 
Would you believe she took the tea pitcher and poured it on the couch this morning ? Thanks < PROPMALE > for leaving the fridge unlocked . 
I'm stressed . 
May I be the first to tell the world that a bid for a new house has been accepted . Translation ... we are buying a new house . Its 45 day escrow so at the end of October I will be moving to new house . A beautiful 4 bedroom 2.5 bath . Two stories and it has blue carpet . 
Paperwork done until they ask for more ... lol . 
My daughter is Smart , Brave and A TROUBLE MAKER . But we love her . 
I hate waiting ! 
< PROPFEMALE > said quesidilla today . 
< PROPFEMALE > has a doll that she calls her baby and she is being very protective of her today . It is very cute . 
If you hated your kids doctor , but you had no one to ask how would you find a new one ? He doesn't seem to care about us at all . His nurses make too many mistakes and are dumb . Where do I go to find a better one ? 
Found new doctor . She seems very nice and her nurses sound good . 
I had a doctors appointment today . 
I know every one is having bad news lately . 
So I want to share some good stuff ! I'm pregnant !!!! 9 weeks !!! 
< PROPFEMALE > was due on < PROPFEMALE>'s birthday , but this time we are due two days before Rebel's birthday . 
May 24thish 
I really really dislike being sick !!! I really don't like that they call it morning sickness . Mine hits around two . Lasts all day !!! I have to take breaks to be sick while I'm making dinner . Yuck ! 
< PROPFEMALE > is THREE today !!!! Its < PROPFEMALE>'s Birthday today !!!!! 
Going to get that special pumpkin for the pumpkin eater ! 
More papers to sign .... Sounds like the last papers ..... maybe this week .... Fingers crossed ! 
I am tired . The tornado never seems to need a break . 
My to do list is longer than my arm and one is packing everything I own . Feels like never going to be done . 
Finished Christmas shopping ! Three presents left to wrap ! Awesome !!!! 
Anyone know how to pick a roofer to fix a roof ? 
When they say you feel the baby move earlier they weren't kidding . Felt the baby move today . Like bubbles , but not . 
I eat chocolate the baby moves like crazy !! I hate moving . 
Cut < PROPFEMALE>'s hair today . Looks okay . 
If I don't get a < PROPMALE > later I wanted to say < PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone . I hope everyone is safe and has a great couple of days ! 
I wanted to tell everyone that we will be having A GIRL !!!! A sister for < PROPFEMALE > !!! Now the naming marathon begins !! 
< PROPMALE > Posting for < PROPFEMALE > : We are moving our internet connection and will not be on the web until the 6th . < PROPFEMALE > said \we love all you goodbye\ " in a goofy voice . " 
SNOW ! Its snowing . Thankfully I don't have to drive in it . By the time I'll want to go out it will have melted and gone away . I love California ! 
It feels like you wait for the weekend and then have to work twice as hard when it gets here ! 
Hope everyone had a good week ! 
29 weeks 2 days . 2 and half more months to go . Any one else feel like it takes forever to have a baby . 
One month to go . Everything is looking really good . I am so much healthy this time . 
Would it be annoying to say that tomorrow it will be 20 days until she's due .? I might be impatient for her to get here . 
My wonderful husband made me French toast in bed and sang me happy birthday . < PROPFEMALE > told me to eat in the kitchen and sang me twinkle twinkle little < PROPFEMALE > . It was really sweet and fun . 
2 weeks ! She needs to get here soon . I feel like I'm going crazy ! I get any bigger and I will explode . Nothing fits any more . I wear big shirts and the wind picks up and everyone can see if I'm wearing a bra or not . < PROPFEMALE > get here and save your momma ! 
I have tried to not count down , but 9 days left to go . 
7 Days !!! I am ready ! Any time now ! 
6 Days . Slowest week ever ! 
4 Days ! My doctor says theres nothing I can do except wait . Feels like forever ! 
2 Days !!! 
She is one day late !!! Still Pregnant ! 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Gifford was born on Wednesday , May 26 , 2010 . She was 7lbs 10 oz . 20.5 inches . She is healthy and beautiful . We are home and < PROPFEMALE > loves her new baby sister ! 
I love my girls . < PROPFEMALE > is being such a sweet heart . 
I found my ankles ! They have been gone for so long and now they have reappeared . I look human now and not a whale . hooray ! 
Going to Cambria on Sunday !!! 
I am so tired . < PROPFEMALE > did not want to sleep two nights in a row . Last night she woke up three times crying . I feel sorry for < PROPMALE > . He has to go to work today after little sleep . 
Had a thunder storm last night and I got to be awake for it . Not my idea , but the lightning woke < PROPFEMALE > several times . If its not one kid its the other keeping me awake for it . 
let's see how creative my facebook friends are . type a 1 word comment about me using the THIRD letter of your FIRST name . it can only be one word . then copy and pastethis so I can leave a word about you . 
Kids are so weird . < PROPFEMALE > refuses to eat any of the ham I made unless it is the top of the whole thing . Not the skin , but is picking strips off the top . Hard to describe , but fun to watch . 
Sleep is so elusive . Both my girls are asleep and I have a huge headache , but no sleep . 
Its going to be one of those days . Think positive next week is Thanksgiving ! One of the best holidays ! 
NEW GAME : Change your profile picture to your favorite cartoon from when you were a kid . The goal of this game is to not see a human picture on Facebookbut an invasion of childhood memories until Monday . PLAY AND PASS ALONG ! ( yes , for some of us - this will TOTALLY date us ) 
I am going to be away from the computer for awhile so I wanted to say it now . HAPPY THANKSGIVING !!!!! 
A beautiful snow man ! What fun ! Brrr . Its cold though . 
I've carried children within my body . Slept with babies on my chest . I've kissed boo boos and mended broken hearts . I've been puked on , peed on , and spent sleepless nights in the rocking chair . But I wouldn't have it any other way . My body isn't magazine perfect , but when I look in the mirror I see a MOM , and there is ... no greater honor ... or blessing !! Post this as your status if you are proud to be a Mom ! 
It's daughter week !! If you have a beautiful daughter that you love more than you can describe , copy and paste this to your wall . Your daughter will hold your hand for a little while , but will hold your heart for a lifetime !

What a day .... 
< PROPFEMALE > likes squash !!! It has taken two months to get her to eat solid food and I have tried everything twice . I have been giving her the gerber graduates and she'll eat those , but its not enough . Finally tonight she is eating squash . Its cute she is sipping it . 
< PROPFEMALE > is standing up on her own and moved away from the couch trying to walk . Of course she fell , but laughed and tried again . Its crazy how fast they grow . 
On my way to the beach tomorrow . Avila in the rain ! I can't wait . 
My poor baby has a fever of 102 . We took her to the doctor and she might have the flu or an ear infection or a bladder infection . I wish they could give better answers . If she's not better by Wednesday back we go . Until then < PROPMALE > and infant Tylenol . 
I loved you the minute I heard you were coming . I loved you the minute you were born ; then I saw your face and fell in love some more . You were only a minute old , but I knew I would die for you and to this day I still would . When you choose to have a child , you make a conscious decision to allow your heart to walk around outside of your body . Put this on your status if you have children you love more than life . 
How frustrating . I bought a cd with my pictures I just developed and it won't read on my computer . It keeps saying its not responding when I click on the tab . 
So I was on the toilet this morning , eating an awesome fried egg sandwich and ... What ? You think there's something wrong with eating in the bathroom ? Did that gross you out ? Then why do people suggest breastfeeding mothers feed their babies in the bathroom ? If you're a fan of parents and babies rights , I DARE you to put this up as your status
