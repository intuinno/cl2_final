Ideas to live by : Less is more ; Take one day at a time ; Do something for the kid in you every day ; Laugh ; Take your work seriously , but not yourself at all ; Have a forgiving attitude , most people are doing the best they can ; Be kind to unkind people ( they probably need it the most ); Sit on your ego ; Talk less , listen more ; Remind yourself that you are not the general manager of the universe ! Thanks mom ! love u :) 
lesson for today : its ok to say no thank you :(
