KID CUDI'S SONGS AREN'T LONG ENOUGH . 

Non-Casual Game of the Day : CAVE STORY 
i can't believe i just made a facebook . 
also , it's taking a long fucking time for this confirmation email to arrive . sorry , blaek . D: 
EO peoples , it's me , Forte . -btw- 
Getting off of facebook . Anyone who sent me a friend request will have to wait until I confirm this fucking shit , which is taking forever to send to my email . 
cleaning shit today . D: 
Nevermind . It looks like I can't clean because < PROPFEMALE > took the fucking vacuum cleaner , -again . - 
Workin ' tomorrow . 
baby , you're always on my mind . i'll always love you , no matter what life throws at us . 
Going into work at 6 . 
Back home from work . As ' good ' as my life is , it sure could be better . You never know what could happen , it could take a turn for the best , or it could stop to a screeching fucking halt -- anything can happen . It sure is wonderful to be depressed one minute , and worried the other . 
If you force sex onto a prostitute , is it rape , or shoplifting ? 
Everyday is repost repost . 
I'm sorry I didn't stay with you , but I have things I need to do . I love you . 
AT JOHNS . ergergerg 
confused . 
completely fucking pissed off . 
my life is almost completely meaningless now , and she couldn't care less . 
Everything turned out better than expected . 
if you had an apple with a staw n you poked the apple though wit it and a pebbl hadnt dropped through itd stop straw insid the apple because gravity cant apple 
Is at work ! 
What a wonderful start to a great day . :] 
A man walks into a bar . He is an alcohol and is destroying his family . 
Will things ever be the way they used to be ? 
When I was a kid I wished time moved faster . Now that I'm older , I wish time moved slower . 
Not much point anymore , is there ? 
Days just keep going by slower and slower as each day passes ... and each day , after everything is done , I sit here patiently -- wondering if I'll ever be back where I belong . 
We are Anonymous . We are Legion . We do not forget . We do not forgive . 
At < PROPFIRST>'s , waiting for him to get here . 
Raving is always fun . :) 
... :/ 
Girl let's get it poppin ' , tell me how you feel . Let's get up on this floor and do this thing for real . ' Cause we , you and me , can really break it down . 
Best be known when I roll around town . 
upset . 
Really happy . :] 
I can speak French , in Russian . 
It's not easy , bein ' cheesy . 
I'M THE PHANTOM < PROPMALE > OF ALL THE MONKEYS . 
It's never enough , no -- it's NEVER ENOUGH . :D 
repent , repent , the end is near . 
We've drifted apart so much . Hardly ever talk , never see each other . Hopefully , that will change . 
What a horrible dream . Maybe it was trying to tell me something .. 
Had an amazing night . Was chillin ' with < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > ! 
Dip dup , to the clup . 
This new meme is a smash success . 
At Carowinds . Also , soaking wet ! But , I am having fun . :) 
I am very , very tired . 
At the DMV . God , I'm nervous . 
Castle Crashers is always a blast . 
Wakin ' up in the morning , Killswitch and Bring me the Horizon ? Awesome . 
Is at a rave ! 
This is my last serenade . 
My somatosensory cortex is more developed then yours . 
Missing her . 
I have been having bad luck all day . This sucks . 
:/ 
Pick up that can . 
About to take my driver test again ! I also had an amazing night with < PROPFEMALE > . :) 
Nevermind , I failed ... again . Take it again in two weeks . I'm highly disappointed . Although it is my fault , I did kind of hit the fence when I went to parallel park . And if I fail again , I have to wait two months . If I don't pass next time , I'm going to kick myself . 
< PROPFIRST > is finally back home ! I've missed that dude , can't wait to chill with him . 
Yeah , I'll take a girl stuff bacon burrtango , with bacon please . Also , a seen a minute twisty , extra bacon , and I'll have some bacon please . Widdly scuds ? 
I've just recently devoloped an odd love for steampunk . 
< PROPFEMALE > Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name . Nobody came . Father < PROPFEMALE > wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave . No one was saved . 
You don't have to be so mean to me . :/ 
ITT : We take pictures of shoes on our head , and post it here . KGO 
Watching Dragonball < PROPFEMALE > . Pretty bored . 
Didn't get to talk to her tonight . -sigh- 
Nah , you know what ? It's okay -- whatever . I'm going to see my friends today anyway . :] 
< PROPFIRST > , you got me addicted to dubstep . 
I'm quite sick of my siblings going through and using my things . I'm sick of < PROPFEMALE > stealing my clothes . I wish I could have a lock for my door . I am missing so many socks , so many shirts .. and everytime I come back home I'm missing more , or my stuff has been moved around . I never mess with anyone elses stuff , because I have respect for others property -- but obviously no one has any respect for mine . 
< PROPFEMALE > DVX . 
So far I've beat Super < PROPFIRST > Bros . Crossover with both Mega Man and Ryu . I have accomplished great things on this day . 
I feel completely , flat out terrible . An empty feeling in the pit of my stomach . It sucks , it really does . I haven't heard at all from < PROPFEMALE > in two days , and it almost breaks my heart . She won't answer my calls , or reply to my texts -- or anything , really . I just feel completely horrible because of it , period . 
< PROPFIRST > Andrews is currently at my house . And we just made steak ! 
Hi I'm < PROPMALE > and I leave myself logged into facebook so that others can get on and post silly statuses . 
Do not like this status . 
I hate it when people like their own status . 
Fuck yeah . Going to a pool party today . Shit's so cash . 
Is on < PROPFIRST>'s computer ! It is the most beautiful thing I have ever laid my eyes on . 
The woman that I love is 40 feet tall . She's a movie < PROPFEMALE > , she's all in the papers . 
\It is I 
Aww snap , I just found some very old < PROPFEMALE > messages . Going through old MySpace messages sure is a blast ! 
Day and night , I toss and turn , I keep stressing my mind . I look for peace but see I don't attain . What I need for keeps this silly game we play . 
23 days . I haven't seen you in 23 days . Does that mean anything to you ? 
I'll be up up and away , up up and away -- ' cuz they gon ' judge me anyway , so whatever . 
If only I could go back to that moment . That moment your beauty first caught my sight , and our eyes locked tight . If only is a powerful phrase , it can lead to thoughts unstirred -- you're in my mind , you're in my heart . And here I stand , with arms open wide , hoping that someday you'll come back into my life . From my heart , to you . 
Fuck my life . Isn't it wonderful to wake up and listen to the person you love tell you she doesn't care anymore ? You bet . 
Fuck yeah . Seaking . 
Twenty-six days . 
Want to talk to me live ? Well , join and talk , yo . \

http://stickam.com/shatteredforte 
Spectating these roads . Curling up my toes . Reminiscing a few , while thinking of you . A smiles slides across my face as I recall your warm embrace . From my heart , to you 
What a wonderful morning to contemplate my life , and how confusing it is . 
Look at me , you tell me just what you see . Am I someone whom you may love , or enemy ? Am I speaking for you and yours , or someone else ? I need some answers . 
Listen good , I don't need nobody . This is what you feel are the sounds of insanity . Hoping what I hear loops itself to finish me . No , I won't be afriad . 
is q.p 
really likes her . :) 
Anyone looking for a scary movie to watch ? I have seen quite a few horror movies , and I'd have to say the scariest one I have ever seen is The Poughkeepsie Tapes . Give it a try people , but only if you want to shit your pants in fear .

\ITT : PC Gamers vs . Gamers with PCs \"" 
I'ma say some shit that make you think I lost my mind . \ 
I'm the only nigga that could watch the sun and don't go blind . 
I was thinking to myself the other day , and I might have given my heart to < PROPFEMALE > emotionally ( which is something I cannot get back ) , but she didn't actually get my real , physical heart . If I wanted to , I could get a heart transplant , and put my heart in some kind of big < PROPFEMALE > or glass to preserve it . Then , I can actually GIVE MY HEART to someone . 
Just got off the phone with < PROPFEMALE > , we talked for over an hour ! :D 
\ .. it's\ 
What a good sleep . Talked to my two favorite girls last night over the phone ! ( < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Burdette and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > ) 
\You do make a good \

Going to New York today . Should be fun , right ? 
Depressed . 
Just hit a thousand pound ton realization that I lost her , and I'll never get her back . But , I suppose that was my fault . I let her go , and now we no longer belong together . Hopefully , I will see her again one day . 
I had an awesome time with my best friend < PROPFIRST > Andrews ! Good to be home , too . 
I need some dubstep suggestions ! One of you mother fuckers has got some suggestions , I bet . I -KNOW- < PROPFIRST > does , and I know he'll probably reply when he sees this . But now that I've said something , he won't say anything just to spite me , or he'll text me . 
This white kitten in my house enjoys sitting in the chair next to mine so she can listen to music . 
It really rustles my jimmies whenever a couple dates for a couple of weeks , and then decide they love each other . 
< PROPFIRST > c o-o wns Finale ? When the FUCK did this happen ? I'm at a loss for words , really . 
Haha , I got the Overdrive package . pwnsome . 
About to leave to go pick < PROPFEMALE > Snow up , then we're going to a rave ! How exciting . 
Had a wonderful time with < PROPFEMALE > Snow . :] THIS RAVE IS BUMPIN ' , TOO . 
I like her more and more as each day passes . <3

If you were born after -insert date here- , you don't know SHIT about video games . 
This is an emergency , music is my galaxy . <3 
SUCK MY STATUS . 
Sometimes you look back , and still find your past looking back at you . As time goes by , it gets easier and easier to move on -- but sometimes you still get that feeling in the pit of your stomach that nothing is ever going to change . With the end of days , comes a new beginning . I hope everything will be alright . 
Riding in a car with two lesbians and < PROPFEMALE > . :) 
Haha , < PROPFEMALE > left her phone in my car . sux 2 b her 
Had an amazing day , and the wedding between < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > was absolutely wonderful . But now I believe it's time to relax and do nothing . 
is completely 100% depressed . my past has bit me back on the ass . why do i feel this way , why must i feel this way . i was reminded of my past earlier , and now my past has come to finish me with one final blow . i am at the lowest point i can possibly achieve . 
i really don't care anymore . i have a car right now , and i could leave right now . does anyone want to < PROPFEMALE > out with me . i really need to get my mind off of shit . 
I got a lot of things off my chest , and hopefully things will start to get better from here on out . I have faith . 
So , apparently my father found a < PROPFEMALE > baby kitten -- so < PROPFEMALE > it has to be bottle-fed . 
just got back from westgate mall . looked around and got an idea of what kind of clothes i want to get , but i'm still going to need < PROPFEMALE > with me when i go . :D 
Someday . 
has very little motivation to do anything . 
1 year , 10 months , 3 days . 
You know what ? On my way back home from taking < PROPFEMALE > back to her house , I got to thinking about something . Fuck being depressed and fuck my past . She wants to treat me like that , after everything I've done for her ? You know what , I'm completely done . I am happy , and I will continue to be happy . 
You won't find a fake smile on my face , you won't find me trying to get\ 
along with everyone in order to bottle up my depression . As of now , I \ 
am completely and 100% focused on myself , my life , and my future --- and\ 
how I plan on furthering myself for my future . You are all the best \ 
friends I could ever ask for , and I love each and every one of you .

PS3fags : Give me a reason why the PS3 is better than the 360 . 
Say , say , say what you want , but don’t play games with my affection . \ 
Take , take , take what you need , but don’t leave me with no direction . 
< PROPFEMALE > just left my house . I really enjoyed hanging out with her , considering I don't get the < PROPMALE > to see her often . I love you , < PROPFEMALE > . <3 
Just got back from my double date with < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > . I had a pretty wonderful night . :D 
Original text : \Batman is better than Robin . \ " \ 
< PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > just left my house recently . Ooooooooooooh , what a wonderful night . :] 
\What makes you think I won't cut you . \"" 
Three days in a row . Just can't seem to see < PROPFEMALE > enough . xD 
Mein kampfy bed . 
She make me feel so good . Better than I would by myself , or if I was with somebody else . You don't understand . 
For my birthday tomorrow , I'm going to Club Escape in Greenville for the Hookah Bar . Who's goin' ?! 
There goes my hero . He's ordinary . 
I'm awake early , which is weird . 
It's both me and < PROPFIRST>'s birthday today . Be sure to give me a call and show me some love . :D 
What do your elf eyes see ? 
had an awesome fucking birthday . Drinking with < PROPFIRST > now . I miss you , < PROPFEMALE > . <3 
In a relationship with < PROPFEMALE > Paiz . :] 
< PROPFEMALE > really needs to give me my shit back . I am getting really sick of talking to her . 
Found an old school pack of Camel Menthol at this gas station near < PROPFIRST > Andrews house today . Fuck right . 
What's not to understand ? You get a boner , slap her titties around a bit , stick it inside her and pee . 
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day . When it's cold outside , I've got the month of May . Well , I guess you'll say ; \What can make me feel this way ? \ " \ 
Just got finished watching Law Abiding Citizen . Wow , that was an excellent movie . 
Going to bed , dead tired . Text me if you want . 
Going to see < PROPFEMALE > tomorrow morning to get my things back from her , finally . Hopefully things go smoothly . 
Onto issue 4 of JTHM . Ooh , I love re-reading through this . Got to spend the entire day with < PROPFEMALE > Paiz ! Also , I got my stuff back from < PROPFEMALE > earlier . She told me to stop putting her name in my statuses ; but if she didn't want to see her name in them , she wouldn't look at my facebook in the first place . :D 
I couldn't be happier . 
You seem slightly aggravated . Dare I say .. mad ? 
I finally found a hidden blade , in the style of Altair's . It comes with a vambrace that acts as a harbor for the blade , of course . The vambrace is completely leather , and has a metal bracer on it . The hidden blade functions just like Altair's , and is completely sharp and made to be sturdy , and obviously made to do what it's primary function is . I can't wait . 
It's over 85 degrees in my house right now . Fuck you AC , why do you have to be broken . 
I realized how < PROPFEMALE > was still able to see my shit on my profile , because apparently I didn't make EVERYTHING private . Well , now it is , so she cannot stalk my facebook anymore . 
Nortor , Naige . Nndrews , Nrandon . Narbare , Nason . 
I apparently cannot borrow my grandfather's car , ( when in reality it should be mine , because it was suppose to be given to me ) because I added over 500 < PROPMALE > to it in a few days by hardly driving around town . Hmm , that seems really plausible , doesn't it ? 
The little kitten is cuddling up to my foot and sleeping . :3 
Hungover . What a crazy yet wonderful night . 
Everything pisses me off right now . I feel like shit . 
Well , looks like I can't play Amnesia : The Dark Descent . It runs fine on my computer , but apparently there is a weird problem that occurs with the ATI X-Series cards , which is what I have . The game freezes anytime I try to open up any menus . There is a fix in the works , but that just means I have to wait . :[ 
Me : \Are you excited about Assassin's Creed : Brotherhood ? \ " \ 
What a boring day . 
I have a beautiful girlfriend , great friends , an awesome best friend , and a great life . Fuck negativity . 
Just got back home from seeing < PROPFEMALE > Paiz , < PROPFEMALE > Paiz , < PROPMALE > Ziggy Scianna , < PROPFIRST > Windham , < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > . Fun stuff . 
Got my tattoo today ! Now I am an assassin . 
To be more specific for those of you who didn't know , I got the Assassin's Creed emblem on my left wrist . I would post a picture , but I don't have a camera . :/ 
What is this I don't even 
A winrar is you . 
Time for another marvelous evening with < PROPFEMALE > Paiz , < PROPFIRST > T . Buehlmann and probably < PROPFEMALE > Paiz .

Literally no energy left whatsoever . 
I've got a secret . It's on the tip of my tongue , it's on the back of my lungs . And I'm going to keep it . I know something you don't know . 
I've got a lot to say to you , yeah , I've got a lot to say . 
Haha . Wow . This sucks . 
Anyone want to buy Minecraft for me ? 
Let's start a hate thread up in this bitch . \ 
I hate it when people have anyone and everyone except their actual siblings on their facebook profile . \ 
I hate it when people date for a short period of time and start telling each other they love each other , and fill their heads with thoughts of marriage and children when they are still children themselves . \ 
I'll think of more , everyone add more things they hate ! 
happy . wmv 
I just saw a baseball bat with a sniper scope taped to it . \ 
My life is complete . 
Selling my old skateboard for 20 bucks . It is still in good condition . Message or text me if you are interested .

Dub FX , why are you so damn good ? I can't stop listening to your music . Hats off to you , good sir . 
Installing Vindictus , bitches . 
Well , looks like I'm not playing Vindictus . Lags like hell on the lowest settings . >.> 
Whole new set ? And another one on the way ? Bitchin'!\ 
Time for some Dead Space action . 
My phone hath been cut off ! Nooooo ! \ 
God dammit , I was trying to send a text too . :/ 
Got my phone back ! And , I'm on the final chapter of Dead Space . I'm a fuckin ' beast , I swear . Level 5 armor , fully upgraded Rig and Plasma Cutter . I have turned a survival horror game into a hack-and-slash with guns . 
Halo sucks . \ 
Gears of War sucks . \ 
Modern Warfare sucks . \ 
DEAL WITH IT .

So I wish I was under a tree , far away from society , where the only truth in me is the soothing sound of my own entity . 
Waking up every day with a beam of the moonlight in my eye . Stimulate my consciousness with the focus of my mind . I’ve got to take myself back to the feeling of eternally breaking free . Knowing that my body’s motionless and still asleep . 
Pants-on-head retarded . 
I am awake too early . 
I'm a better troll than you're . 
Music is my first love , it will always be my last . 
Lords of Shadow is out . \ 
I need this game . 
I would say things aren't going well because I try to make everyone happy , but that is an overused excuse . 
I can’t erase memories with the actions I seize , and I can not erase your smiles and your eyes . 
I love how I am suppose to be fine . Oh sure , we weren't together long , but that doesn't matter , because I still really enjoyed our relationship . And no , obviously , I didn't fall in love or anything like that . I'm not devastated that I lost my relationship with a really cool girl . I'm just upset for that aforementioned reason , because I lost my relationship with a really cool girl . 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone . It's not warm when she's away . \ 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone , and she's always gone too long anytime she goes away . 
I watched Avatar for the first time last night . \ 
It actually wasn't horrible . 
There is a song in my head . A song dedicated to you . 
Brohammad < PROPFIRST > 
I have a plan for Halloween , but I need a lot of people to do it . \ 
I wanted to gather a bunch of people , dress up like zombies , and do a Zombie Walk . Who's in ? 
I don't like explaining exactly why I don't like something , because then \ 
people try to prove me wrong with their own opinion , which I find \ 
annoying . 
Fumbling his confidence and wondering why the world has passed him by . Hoping that he's meant for more than arguments and failed attempts to fly . 
Confused , confused , confused . One for each particular event . Wow , what the fuck should I do . Ugh . 
There's times for gettin ' down , and there's times for gettin ' funky ; and this is one of those funky times . 
rahrahrah getting a job tomorrow probably 
:[ 
Going through old emails is always a blast . \ 
It's especially a blast when I learn I apparently used to speak < PROPMALE > . 
Well shit . Mysterion is < PROPMALE > . 
I did what I wanted to do . Didn't solve anything , didn't amount to anything . \ 
I just makes me realize things about me , about my past . \ 
I'm not happy . 
Friday's raves are always fun . Took my mind off of things , and I got a bunch of new pictures . :] 
FUCKING CASUALS . 
Oh , how I love my delightful , silly sister . 
Minecraft difficulty settings :\ 
Casual\ 
Hard 
Kid Cudi's new album is fucking amazing . 
Casual < PROPMALE > . 
I keep on running , keep on running and nothing works -- I can't get away from you . I keep on ducking , keep on ducking and nothing helps -- I can't stop missing you . 
The rave tonight is sure to be amazing , as it always is ! 
I had a very enjoyable night at the rave , as always . I also had a really fun time hanging out with < PROPFEMALE > Rocho again ! I missed her so much . :] 
Started playing Afraid of Monsters , an old mod for the first Half-Life that is apparently the scariest game ever . \ 
Holy fucking shit . Fuck this . -crawls into corner- 
About to leave for Columbia ! 
I really like her . I think she feels the same way . :] 
Back home from Cola . :) 
Send me a question , and I will answer it . I guess . 
Someone suggest a movie for me to watch . 
Anyone have Fable 3 ? 
Anyone want to < PROPFEMALE > out . Don't have anything to do , been kind of down . 
You suddenly feel buttery and delicious . 
NOTCH IS ADDING A ' HARDCORE ' DIFFICULTY TO MINECRAFT . \ 
FUCK YEAH . 
I had a thought for my second tattoo . How does a spinal cord tattooed on .. my spinal cord sound ? 
Another amazing artist I love ? Uffie , you are amazing . 
I have discovered < PROPFEMALE>'s horrible secret . \ 
She is actually an owl . 
Sometimes I wanna copy someone's status , word for word , and see if they notice .

Kid Cudi live ? \ 
Just as good as Kid Cudi in studio . 
Alright , I am done . Giving up .

If we could break down those walls to set you free , we would , because we're out here , and we miss you . If we could build a ladder that tall to come up and see you , we would , because we're down here , and we miss you .

Just finished < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim . Man , that movie is the shit .

It's difficult to get to know someone when they don't talk back to you . >.> 
Played Dungeons and Dragons for the first time ever last night with < PROPFIRST > Andrews , < PROPFIRST > T . Buehlmann and < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Satterfield . It was amazing fun ! Fear my level 1 Human Rogue . : x

Message me a number and I'll tell you the secret to the universe . 
42 ; You have always been an amazing person . Randomly , I will catch myself thinking about our part and how exceptionally wonderful it was . It also makes me realize how special I was to you , and you with me . I will always regret losing you , but the past is the past I suppose . I still want to maintain the friendship we always have , and I hope to see you again soon . 
I am on my phone currently , and t9 sucks . Send me < PROPFIRST > , I will answer them when I get back home . 
2142 ; I still sort of remember one of the first times I ever saw you . It was about 3 years ago or so , when I still lived at the apartment . I thought you were quite gorgeous ( and still do ) , and thought you acted very silly ( in a good way ) . I came to really like your personality , and a lot of things about you actually , and developed a crush on you . 
5623 ; You know , it's been quite some time since we've last saw each other . A lot of my favorite memories of us hanging out were the apartment . Like whenever the whammy bar on < PROPFIRST>'s guitar broke because of < PROPFIRST > and I's elaborate plan . xD That shit is still funny to this day looking back . You've always been a pretty great friend , and our friendship will continue on ! We need to see each other more often , though . 
56 ; THE APARTMENT ! That's where all the excellent memories come from , eh ? A good portion of my past seems to stem from there , but you are one of the main pieces of that ! Back when raving was still sort of a new thing to us , I suppose . But , time continues to go on , and things have certainly changed since then . 
996 ; I miss you , and I love you ! I'm sure we will see each other again very soon , but let's make it sooner just to be sure . We've known each other for a long time , fond memories seem to pop into my mind from years ago . But , they are all good memories , and we have never had any bad ones ! ... Not really , anyway . :p Also , I suddenly have the odd sensation to consume fish and berries . RUN E > 
1217 ; Whenever we talk , I'm instantly taken back to those very memories you mentioned . Our first kiss on the elevator , our walk on the beach , sitting in that odd hallway with other friends and talking about things I can't exactly remember . And also .. < PROPFIRST > was there too , I believe ?

So , I was destined to figure out what the fuck a ' G6 ' is , and why it pisses me off so much . I found out apparently that the term ' G6 ' is referring to a Gulfstream G650 , which is a \twin-engine business jet aircraft under development by Gulfstream Aerospace . \ " The reason why the term is used ? Because it flies . Such lyrical genius . >.>" 
> implying there is something on my mind

Today sucks . The snow ruined everything . Going to find something to eat then probably lay down . 
Any non-casuals who are < PROPFEMALE > enough to drive in this snow ? 
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup , they slither while they pass they slip away , across the universe . 
Well , my phone was finally cut off . Damn it . >.> 
Anyone doing a New Years < PROPFEMALE > party < PROPMALE > Dearnaley and I can go to ?

Dead Space II is going to be fucking amazing . 
It's gettin ' late but I don't mind . 
And in retrospect I'll say we've done no wrong . \ 
Who are we to judge what's right and what has purpose for us ? \ 
With designs upon ourselves to do no wrong . \ 
Running wild unaware of what might come of us .

Oh fine , but don't count on this all the time ! \

Everyone has that one friend . You know who I mean . That one guy that says if the graphics are bad , it's a bad game ? The one who hates RTS games because it's too complicated ? Thinks that M rated games are the best , mainly because they are M rated ? \ 
Yeah , that guy . Fuck that guy . \ 
( Also , if I ask you if you like FPS games , and you instantly begin talking about Halo or Call of Duty , you're not a gamer . ) 
Laying in bed making hand puppets from the light on my phone . You are on my mind , sweetheart . E > 
My contract is sealed .

I want to be where I don't need to hide myself . \ 
And remain there until the end of time . 
I am so happy with my life now . When I look into the future , all I see is love , happiness . I look forward to my future .

Why am I up so early . 
We're just a regular , everyday normal crew . \ 
You can fuck with us , ' cause we won't fuck with you . 
I should be studying and working hard , my future depends on this bizarre . \ 
Why am I standing in this noisy club ? With people I hate ? What the fuck ? \

I just had the best sleep ever . 
\Final Fantasy XII was the best game in the series\ " \ 
I finally beat the Black Cocks campaign the other day . I have to say , there were a few missions in it that weren't completely fucking horrible . But as far as the multiplayer goes ? Complete and utter fucking shit , always has been . I've known this for a long time now . Probably mostly because of the horrible fucking community of gamers , but also just because it's a shit game . 
Always is valueless , I wish I never heard her speak a word . 
For all my Minecraft bros :\
