The fire burns hotter , the miracles grow greater , now is His time , He won't wait til later . 

even this day ... \and calleth those things which be not as though they were . \ " Rom . 4:17 " 
Since God's pruning is often a refining fire and satan has a perversion for everything , whose refining will you submit too . Both are hot so seek wisdom AND understanding . 
... give you a hint ... k-a-b -o-o- o-m-m !!! hahaha ! that was fun . N-e-x-t !

have you had to move the wind ? will your waters part ?

Know that , if you are being criticised , you are absolutely on the right track . Ask Jesus ... 
Been keeping ba-a-a-a-a-a-d company ... 
When you put a sponge in a bucket of water , is the sponge in the water or is the water in the sponge ? \If you abide in Me and my Word abides in you ... \ " PS . Stay baptized ! " 
Just a thought ... \ 
I have the right to say who visits me , who comes to my home , who stays in my house and who eats my food . \ 
SO DO ALL THE RESIDENTS OF ARIZONA ! \ 
Just a thought ... 
Is the < PROPFEMALE > ON your house or just ABOVE it ? II Chron 7:3 KJV vs . NIV . Is it a form with no power ? II < PROPMALE > . 3:5 . Just a thought . In the words of the prophet , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > , \there's a whole lotta shakin ' goin ' on ... \"" 
If you're ONE , you WON . In a covenant marriage , 1 + 1 + 1 = 1 . 
Point to ponder . If all the parts of your body are always connected to your head , all the parts of your body will always go where your head goes ... no more , no less . Is that always good ? 
... this is LEFT , this is RIGHT , this is UP , this is DOOOOWWWWNN .... sometimes our own walk is the most difficult to keep an eye on . But then ... nobody's watching .... < PROPMALE > 30:21 if you care to look ... 
If God be for you , who can be against you , but , who's that walking behind you ? < PROPMALE > 30:21

I speak that which I have seen with my Father : and ye do that which ye have seen with your father . \

WHO'S YOUR DADDY ? 
Never in 62 years have I seen so many miracles taking place ! Big ones , little ones - really all the same size when you put them in perspective . I COULDN'T DO IT . And they are just as available to us today as they were when Jesus's feet were touching earth . The biggest difference seems to be the volume , both in decibals and quantity , of the voice of man in his own wisdom , telling us what won't work and what can't be . 
... and if you need encouragement ... Romans 5:19 For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners , so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous . \ 
1 < PROPFIRST > 15:22 And < PROPFIRST > said , Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices , as in obeying the voice of the LORD ? Behold , to obey is better than sacrifice , and to hearken than the fat of rams . 
Have you ever considered speaking < PROPFIRST>'s words with regard to your own relationship with the Lord ? If you're not really ready , be silent . He will take you at your word just as we are to take Him at His . \ 
< PROPMALE > 1:38 And < PROPFIRST > said , Behold the handmaid of the Lord ; be it unto me according to thy word . And the angel departed from her . 
When you receive good counsel and it comes in the form of an Advil , put it in your mouth and not your pocket . It has to go in and circulate before it can help ... 
I hear your mouth and I'm watching your feet .. \ 
Soon I will know how often they meet ... \ 
( things that make you go \hmmm . \"" 
How often do I do everything like nobody else ... hmmm ... strange ... 
Psalm 23:5 \Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies ... \ " \ 
What did you grumble about today ? 
How many have ever heard a \word\ " or \ " teaching\ " on the word \ " ALL\ " as it's used in God's word ? \ 
In God's great scheme , in His perfect plan ... are you a < PROPFIRST > or a Golioth ? The longer I ponder this question in my own life , the more God speaks to me about . It's \quite a listen \"." 
PSALM 34:19 Many are the afflictions of the righteous : but the LORD delivers him out of them all\ 
< PROPFIRST > 5:45 for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil & on the good , & sendeth rain on the just & unjust\ 
GOOD & BAD experiences manifest in lives of good & bad people . Death in family , bankruptcy , foreclosure , divorce , prison . Yet will God , if we are steadfast in Him , free , prosper , heal & promote us . His Kingdom is well 
I am challenged by Job and I must inspect myself . How committed am I to this God ? \ 
Job 13:15 Though he slay me , yet will I trust in him : but I will maintain mine own ways before him . 
\I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of \ 
Lovin ' life with a Covenant Wife ... God's love and peace ... no worries , no strife . Hallelujah ! A Sovereign God will always provide ! 
God accepts us without perfection ... as long as we are moving toward it . \ 
Hebrews 6 1 Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ , let us go on unto perfection ; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works , and of faith toward God , 2 Of the doctrine of baptisms , and of laying on of hands , and of resurrection of the dead , and of eternal judgment . 3 And this will we do , if God permit . 
In Ephesians 5:20 -33 , man has the greater responsibility but , again , woman has the greater job ... Sorry guys . 
Who will you follow today ? Three choices : 1 . God 2 . Satan 3 . Yourself ( which is still #2 ) . He said \I AM the way .. \"" 
... but I'm hearing voices . GOOD ! Pick one and tell the rest to SHUT UP ! Follow the ONE you KNOW to follow . The sheep always follow the shepherd's voice . Are you a sheep ? BAAAA ! 
When God promotes you to the next level , your \list\ " gets added to as well . It's the list of things that \ " others may\ " but you \ " may not\ " . Are you ready ? He knows you're able . " 
When God speaks ... do you KNOW it's Him ? If you do , you already have everything it takes to allow and assist in the manifestation of those words . 
I prayed . I even asked others to pray . God didn't answer me ... well , if He did , I didn't hear him ... It's His fault . Well , it's not MY fault ... well , I didn't do ANYTHING . \ 
\That's right 
It's raining . But is it just water ? Why do many look at what God's word often uses to represent life and call it dreary ? Must be a flaw in the relationship somewhere . I'm watching God pour down life on all who will receive it . Any takers ? 
God has opened a door of Provision . It's not about $$$ . It's about Him where ALL and EVERYTHING is provided . Doors swing both ways . Which side of the door will you be on when it swings back ?

When your spiritual sponge gets squeeeeeezed real good , what's inside will be seen by all ... 
Why are so many professing Christians willing to be denied what God has promised them ? Have you ever meditated on being made \in His image and in His likeness\ " ? < PROPFEMALE > 1:26 if you care to read it . " 
Can your spirit be \infected\ " or only \ " afflicted\ " ? Try going \ " just a little deeper \"." 
It's mashed potatoes and steak I want when I eat ... \ 
But I compare footsteps and words from the people I greet . \
