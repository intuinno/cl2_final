wants Season 2 of < PROPMALE > to come out on DVD so bad ! Hurry up ! 
just got home from Church and feels at peace with himself and with the world . He plans on becoming better at what he learned and hopes to mold and modify himself as the potter molds and modifies a wet soon-to-be pottery sculpture ...

weaved around the next corner , his G36 in hand . He was dressed in body armor and a tactical helmet , his torso and legs organized with magazines , clips , flashbangs and frag grenades . The chopping , whoosing sound of a helicopter could be heard nearby . Riski 
just applied for some kick-A jobs on Hotjobs ! And he's also been pondering life in general as he sits here in front of this computer screen . Being single , he feels like a kite that suddenly morphs into a fighter jet with unlimited fuel ; free to roam the w 
just applied for Institute at the University of Utah and feels like he's finally taking control of both his temporal and spiritual life . He has such the perfect rig ! College classes on Monday through Thursday then two Institute classes on Friday only ! Friday will become known as Institute Day in the life of < PROPFIRST > . 
My middle name is Booata . Hear me howl at the sky and laugh while I massacre life's problems . 
was clinging for dear life to the side of the boat that was speeding at 40 knots across the Gulf of Mexico . McCrowe thought that < PROPFIRST > would be finally finished , but < PROPFIRST > smiled confidently . His belt was engineered to serve as a top-secret high-strength rapelling cable ; < PROPFIRST > fired the cable into the hull . In a death-defying spray , he released his grip and immediately shot behind the boat . He stood .. and < PROPFIRST > his weapon 
is praying for financial aid to cover all his schooling and books so he can get a phone ... 
feels like an idiot after last night . Why are there always certain people in front of whom you always sound like a moron , no matter how you attack the situation ? Doesn't help when you've known them for years ... 
doesn't feel like a moron anymore ; in fact , he feels like < PROPMALE > Pitt : adventurous , conniving , daring , dashing , and good-looking ! Even if he's not that good-looking , who cares ? Happiness is in the eyes of the beholder ... :) 
just went through his Facebook friends and deleted all the ones who don't do ANYTHING ! In other words , if you're reading this , it means that you've done something for < PROPFIRST > in the past that would qualify you as a true friend , great or small ; none of this courtesy-friend-but-not-really-your-friend , -in-fact , -i-don't-really-want-to-be-your-friend-but-I-don't-want-to-look-like-a-douchebag crap ! I seek for Authenticity ! :) 
is beginning to learn that life is like a river . He can't see them , but his ears can pick up the rushing sound of rapids ahead . The question is , where are they , and how much time does he have left to prepare ? 
is currently fidgeting in the canoe he calls his mind as he floats down the river of life . All looks calm in the distance , but < PROPFIRST>'s smarter than just relying on plain eyesight ; he can hear thrashing , dangerous rapids far off in the distance . Hence , he is fidgeting in his canoe , trying to see which bag of tricks will be the best to use SHOULD the rapids suddenly appear out of nowhere ... 
just had an epiphany from playing his two applications on Facebook ; they need to send the Special Forces to take care of the Mafia ! Say goodbye to organized crime ! Operation : Boondock Saints . 
is happy to be back in school again . 
wore the stupidest shirt today . He's decided to scratch that plan from now on . 
sometimes wonders if he's living a huge lie ; he doesn't know who to trust , or who to believe . His only option is to rely on himself and God ; if everything else gets shot to hell , those are the only two people he's going to have besides his family . 
says : \Dun wry . It's K now . \"" 
wants everyone to know how grateful he is for helping him when he was having a bad day . Now that things are better , is it okay for him to say he has the best freaking Institute teacher in the world ? The guy's amazing ! < PROPFIRST > feels like he can move a mountain now that he's home . 
loves writing his converts on Facebook . It feels so rewarding . 
never conquered , rarely came ; sixteen just held such better days . Days when he still felt alive . He couldn't wait to get outside -- the world was wide , too late to try . The tour was over , he'd survived . He couldn't wait ' till he got home to pass the time in his room alone ... 
is currently browsing cell-phone plans with his new paycheck . 
has Netflix . He's been enjoying the online streaming and he can't wait for his first rentals to show up . 
has Netflix . He's been enjoying the online streaming and he can't wait for his first rentals to show up . Also , the Institute program at the U is the shiz ! Every week he gets updated emails regarding activites . He plans on attending next Friday's free breakfast with pancakes that goes on for four straight hours . Anybody else is invited to come . 
sighed , his breathing filled with sorrow and pain . For so long he had waited the time when he could put the missions , the danger , the espionage behind and live a normal life . But now , with Illiana six feet beneath a bittersweet bouquet of roses and lilacs , there would be no return to normality . He rummaged in his hallway closet until his hands found an old case . It was his first love . Her name was < PROPFEMALE > . 45 Silenced 
slid across the cemented floor . It was all or nothing now . Just as the thick steel armored door was about to close , < PROPFIRST > risked being crushed as his body missed the large , cylindrical door pins by centimeters ; it was so close he could feel the chill from the steel . In a split second there was a loud thump and < PROPFIRST>'s momentum finally stopped . He < PROPFEMALE > to his feet as bullets pinged helplessly . Again , he had escaped ... 
just had the best experience in a long time ! Now he misses Ecuador ... but he's more than stoked to stay true to the Gospel . 
has a new financial goal . Modern Warfare 2 . 
STILL has a new financial goal . Modern Warfare 2 . 
STILL has a new financial goal . Modern Warfare 2 . However , an idea just came to mind . Why can't you convert the money you make in Mafia Wars into REAL money ? :D Then < PROPFIRST > could haz Modern Warfares 2's . 
( figuratively speaking about an actual event ) saw the danger that had been avoided as he saw the enemy from far away scouring over the place where he had camped the night before . Dressed in fatigues and perfectly camouflaged from view , he took his automatic rifle , fixed the bayonet at the end , and stabbed the tip of it into the ground so that the rifle stood straight up . He knelt aside , and thanked his Maker ... 
has become as < PROPMALE > Cook . He seeks to \upgrade his life\ " . :) " 
just found out that one of his Young Men's buddies died in a climbing accident last Saturday . Super sadface ! He'd been good friends with the kid since he moved into the < PROPMALE > in Teacher's Quorum ... 
is currently listening to the Last of the Mohicans soundtrack on his headphones and can't help but < PROPFEMALE > at how lush and inspiring the music is ! So what if critics only gave it 3.5 stars out of five ? It's a dang good soundtrack with a lot of fertile , lush instruments and , by jove , I really like it ! Don't get me wrong , I'm still a huge Dream Theater/Rush prog rock fan , but sometimes its nice to hear something ... nice . 
could feel by the weight of his gun that he had perhaps three or four bullets left in the clip at the most . The security door had sealed itself shut , although this time < PROPFIRST > truly did not know what his next move was going to be . By buying time he had only gotten himself deeper into the jaws of Red Section of Sector 7 . But where was he ? He examined . His heart sank . All around him in capsules were clones ... of McCrowe .

knew that as an Operations Officer there was always the possibility of being captured and tortured , unbeknownst to his own agency . Now he found himself in such a position . Given nothing but a pair of underwear two sizes too short , he sat strapped in a chair with an electrode clipped to his ear and another on his little toe . It would come . Soon . < PROPFIRST>'s eyes searched the room . There it was . He smiled ... 
worries about his friends , depending upon their situations and what they have ahead of them . He is worried about once such friend ...

slammed into the cold , hard cement floor as he was tossed into the cell , his torture session obviously less-than-favorable . But he had survived . Now he would only have a few hours before it would resume again . Despite his physical and emotional exhaustion , he immediately sat up as the door slammed . There certainly had to be a way out of this . Then , he noticed that the door had a simple lock . He smiled ... 
pulled the drain cover from the middle of his cemented cell room with every last fiber his finger ligaments could muster . When it came off , he found what he was looking for : The O-Ring . Patiently but consistently he bended the ring back and forth until * snap * it broke in half ! His body still wrenched of strength from the torture session , he haphazardly crawled to the lock . He inserted the metal and began to pick ... 
is thinking about what he's going to get his friends for their B-Days ... a luxury yacht , a beach house in Hawaii , a five-star cruise in the Caribbean , a large share of < PROPFEMALE>'s most valuable property near St. < PROPFIRST > ( for < PROPMALE > ) , a trip to the world's only seven-star hotel in the United Arab Emirates , a third of the profits from Exxon's oil drilling in Arabia -- oh wait , he doesn't have that kinda money .... :( 
, at this very moment , is currently marveling at the new boundaries which are being tested and eventually bypassed in Science . He has just witnessed evidence of cloaking technology which is very real ; a professor at Duke University has just found the secret to refracting and reconstructing microwaves , a professor at the University of Tokyo has developed material to make ponchos which are invisible to cameras ... wow . 
is so happy that Bry is going to take his classes for him during the week while he takes the week off . That's so nice of him . 
is open to ideas . What should we do for his birthday party ? 
better said , what would YOU like to get out of < PROPFIRST>'s birthday party ? 
is just about to go to sleep . By 3:50 A.M. he had read three chapters in his finance book and finished the online test with time to spare ! The funny part ? He feels pretty good about it . Gotta love reading comprehension combined with speed reading . Goodnight , y'alls! Zzzzzz ... 
is happy with his own life but is sad for the lives of a dear family who is close to him . They are going through some heartbreaking times and the darkness only seems to be in the beginning stages of gathering . They will be in his prayers . How interesting it is , though , that just when all this is starting to happen that < PROPFIRST > S . Monson's counsel was that we be charitable one with another and lift each other's burdens 
could feel the blood rushing to his head as he dangled upside-down ten stories high . The cold night air and rain of South Korea provided some much-needed comfort . Up above , a computerized bollet system controlled the rope from which he < PROPMALE > .

Sure enough , Agent < PROPMALE > was being \questioned\ " . < PROPFIRST>'s hand slid . His weapon ... " 
hopes that everything goes well , but if it DOES go well , he will have an Xbox 360 with 1 controller , COD 4 , and Halo 3 ODST and a complimentary 3 month gold membership arriving with his name on it this Thursday , not to mention with his Employee Discount he saved 10% which equals roughly $30.00 ... :) 
had a great day at and after school and a really crappy day at work . I'm talking REALLY crappy . And worse , it's with his co-workers , not the customers , which is what makes it so crappy . Some of his closest friends at work now think he's a retard for what he got for his birthday . He now feels like he has no friends at work , at least for now . He feels alone , rejected , and worst of all , unintelligent . Hope = 0 for today 
is going to sleep now . Good night . I'ma go to sleep . 
is happy again after getting some sleep and having other things occupy his mind . He's still not looking forward to going to work today , but life happens like that sometimes . He guesses the important thing is that you stay close to the important things in life without getting caught up in the things that are of little worth or can have bad reprocussions . His overall outlook for today : \Yellow Caution\ " :P " 
was currently off duty and sworn to secrecy never to reveal his skills or identity in public . But above , in the ominous back-way apartment window , he could clearly hear the muffled screams of a woman . Though in regular clothes and in broad daylight , < PROPFIRST > quietly dropped and hid his backpack while he checked to make sure his gun was hidden beneath his shirt . He then gripped the brick wall and climbed ... 
is 23 . Yay ! :D He flexes his < PROPFIRST > McConaughey upper body as he welcomes his manhood smiling with a bright twinkle in his teeth on his < PROPMALE > Butler face ( FLASH ) Bright sunlight penetrates his eyes ; his view finally comes into focus . As he rubs his eyes , it dawns on him that he's been sleeping . He stares at his reflection in the open laptop screen to the right of his bedside . Definitely not what he saw in the dream 
just found an unlikely form of entertainment . If you like sports , go on YouTube , look up < PROPMALE > Sanders highlights , mute the audio from the < PROPFEMALE > , then play the song \Can't Touch This\ " while watching the video on mute . Funnier than I expected ... "

can't believe its already been a year since he read Clive Cussler's Valhalla Rising . That means he finished Sahara a year and a month ago ! Weird ... doesn't seem that long . 
had a good thrill last night after work playing Bioshock for the first time with the brightness set down to the actual recommended level and all the lights turned off . Did he mention that the killer Head Surgeon guy didn't appear until < PROPFIRST > turned around and the guys eyes were staring directly in his face ? < PROPFIRST > sinned . He swore . Then he shocked the guy , pulled out his gun and shot at his head with extreme prejudice .. 
had fun last night . Now he's had his fill . Did he mention he was up until 6:10 this morning ? 
has been contemplating the future in conjunction with the words of Dallin H . Oaks ' address on the jeopardy of Freedom of Religion . He wonders how much the world will have changed in 10 years ...

thinks its an epic fail that a kid in his Institute Class at the U keeps talking about why BYU is so much better than the University of Utah in the most serious way . Why don't you just go to freaking BYU , then , if its so much better ? Even the Institute teacher wonders about the kid ... 
thinks of Provo as a modern-day Jersualem , a land that was once righteous but has now become so caught up in its reputation and traditions that its beginning to lose sight of what really pertains to the laws of God . Mountain Dew and Dr. Pepper against the Word of Wisdom ? Seriously ?! Oh , okay , but its totally fine to exercise unrighteous dominion over your wife and kids . Honestly , people , are you freaking serious ? >:\\ 
thinks that its very rare to find a band who's songs just keep getting better and better the more you find them . But he's definitely found one of those groups . Muse . No odd-time signatures as is usually a pre-requisite with progressive rock fans like myself , but creative and original enough that every new song he chooses to listen to passes the test . The only other simple-time band to do that with < PROPFIRST > is Pink < PROPMALE > . 
finds it interesting when he Googles his last name . I guess an uncle of mine was the Prime Minister for the Gilber Islands ? Fancy that . Ha , he had to have been related considering that some people didn't like him very much and he was able to smooth-talk his way out of any situation . :\\ .... DONT LOOK AT ME !! >:P 
knew that his execution was only minutes away . Think think think ! he told himself . Apparently he had been unconscious before being handcuffed to a secure anchor bolt in an old house somewhere in the Baltic Wilderness . Suddenly a familiar swooshing sound of hisses and snaps peppered the wall next door , followed by a brief grunt and a dead-man's drop . Two armed men entered with gas masks and body armor . The S . A . S ... 
has just had an epiphany ; one that is very sobering , yet enlightening . Sounds like he's got some work to do ... :\\ 
wishes to thank < PROPMALE > for introducing him to the Veer Union . Thanks , < PROPMALE > . :D 
walked to his window , his hair tousled from a night's rest , the T.V. downstairs mumbling some form of news . His eyes squinted as he fumbled around to open the blinds ; suddenly , as the blinds came open , he exclaimed : \What the SNOW ??! \"" 
just found the coolest mask for Halloween from work tonight , so cool that he \secretly\ " held it by stashing it away in some unseen corner behind the customer service desk so he can come back and buy it tomorrow without someone taking it . Now all he has to do is find a black cloak that fits him perfectly .... " 
' s fears come alive in this place where he once died . Demons screaming , nowhere to hide ; < PROPFIRST > just needed to realign . ( Can you name that song ? :D ) On a side note , he felt the Halloween Party went pretty well . Thanks to everyone who brought the refreshments and good laughs . And thanks especially to Zac for inviting me . ;) 
doesn't know where he's going , but he's loving this handbasket ! :D 
is , believe it or not , actually really stoked for Church today . Always helps to have a personal , one-on-one experience with the Man Upstairs . Hopefully he can find some guidance for some deep questions he has today . There's always a little apostasy in all of us that could use an examination . :) 
can't wait until the 10th of November !!!! Can anyone guess why ? :P 
has finally made a Career Choice . Apparently , the F.B.I. and the Supreme Court have enacted a deal in which any civilian who prevents or provides preventative information regarding espionage will be rewarded up to a maximum of $ 500,000 dollars ( http://www.fbi.gov/hq/ci/cointell.htm ) . I call it : \Homemade Counterintelligence\ " . :D " 
sprung from the lip of the helicoptor's open hatch into the ferocious waves below . Indeed the hurricane was everything he expected plus more . As the water immediately closed over his head , he noticed that the bottom was eerily darker than normal waters .

' s heart totally goes out to < PROPMALE > and his family for all the $%^@ they've had to put up with these last few days , and he doesn't think its right that the other family should ignore the attempts at peace the Bowers have made . That's Allstate's Stand . And , surprisingly enough , < PROPFIRST > himself is a little depressed over a few things in his personal life , but that really doesn't matter right now . He can handle it on his own

wants to know : Is it bad if you fall bad with a family for the sake of standing up for one of your best friends ? I know I may not make the most Christ-like decisions at times , but when my friends are hurt , I'll stick up for them . Is this bad if it means that another family who's beginning to make accusations doesn't like < PROPFIRST > anymore ? He doesn't aim for an all-out war ; he just rescues his friends from nearby hostiles 
placed the silenced pistol in its attache case and fastened the buckles shut . Beautiful green meadows swayed in the constant breeze . Flowers blossomed underneath the green trees . Not far off , near the farmhouse , stood a beautiful young lady in a blue dress with a simple flower pattern , looking and smiling at him . < PROPFIRST > smiled back as he removed his sunglasses . Then , running ! They ran and embraced each other ... 
stood behind the glass of his Penthouse downtown , watching the rain fall in red and yellow beads which glowed from the lights at night . For a long while he stared deeply through the glass and city into his soul . The rain fell with metallic pats that could be heard from the roof above . He sighed and turned around . A city full of light , of thrill , of excitement . But only one thing was missing . Someone to do it with ... 
knows that it is foolish to fight your battles in the way your enemy wants you to fight them . Giving into your enemy's wishes only leads to an inevitable destruction with excess pain and misery . Hence , < PROPFIRST > plans on staying away from his lifelong Enemy as much as possible . It is time to move forward . 
marvels at how a good friend and any relaxing song played on an acoustic guitar can really change one's mood and outlook on life . He is pondering the very science behind music and its effect on the human psyche . Coming from a percussionist's perspective , meter , tempo and certain patterns in pitch really do have an effect on human mood , especially since 99% of the time we are unaware of the stimuli itself ... 
also thinks that < PROPMALE > is an excellent name for any guitarist . :) 
Good point . Happy Thanksgiving everybody ! I'm thankful for all of you ! 
is pondering this fine Sunday afternoon . How good it feels to have a day of rest . 
just had an epiphany . All humans have some form of unquenchable < PROPFEMALE > to explore which can be likened to actual physical exploration . Whether the crossing of mountains , the scouting out of newfound territory , and the crossing of valleys , rivers , lakes and seas is literal or figurative , all of us find enjoyment in doing that which teaches us something new . Whether it is good or evil is simply up to us ... 
also realized today that there's an elusive danger in confusing our own personal desires and passion with the will of God , especially with dating and eternal marriage . No , he didn't pull the spiritual card on anybody ( you can't do that when you're single ) , but he sees it quite often at this stage in life . We should not assume that because our personal desires are strong that it is God's will . Only God can decide that 
was asked on a date tonight which was pretty good . The girl kinda liked to do most of the talking but it was alright . A casual walk through the mall talking and getting to know each other after dinner at this new restaurant she wanted to try worked surprisingly well . Question is , does < PROPFIRST > really want to pursue this relationship or not ? 
, after some thought , has decided against it . The reason ? She's in our age group but she's been married and divorced twice and she still hangs out with her Ex's . Hence , < PROPFIRST > has decided it best to just keep things in the friendship sector . 
is very tired right now but learned an important lesson today . If someone that's supposed to work with you is totally annoyed by who you are , just be yourself and let them deal with it . Honestly , I've noticed that a few certain people who shall not be named have grown rather annoyed and disappointed with my being , but when this began to weigh upon my mind , a voice suddenly spoke to my soul and told me not to worry ... 
can't help but laugh at the steady decline in entertainment quality in our country's culture . Life's lessons , a new original idea , understanding the true potential of a human being , remembering that good versus evil always promotes humanity regardless of your religious standpoint ? PFFF ! Who needs that when you can just make unlimited sequels or take something mundane and put it in 3D ? 
has now officially gone an entire week without any video games , and ironically , he's noticed a dramatic improvement in his ability to imagine new things and he no longer feels awkward when he socializes ( although we are all prone to awkward moments from time to time ) . He still plans on playing a few every now and then , but he's surprisingly happy at the change . But how ? Video games are what started his imagination ... 
still stays true to his decrease in video games , but for the record , he beat Assassin's Creed tonight . WOW ! Amazing story !! He's looking forward to tomorrow so he can get stuff done . He's even speculating going to the < PROPFEMALE > to find some answers . 
didn't make it to the < PROPFEMALE > today but he's registered for new classes and is looking forward to getting a Math class out of the way ... 
isn't exactly sure how much longer he's got until his Associate's , but he wants to get it soon ! >:( 
hopes to sell his books later on this morning so Bungie can give him his monies . Once the Christmas budget gets finalized , it'll be time for Assassin's Creed 2 ! :D 
splurged because he just couldn't resist it . He has Assassin's Creed 2 , now , and played all the way through the first memory block . He is very pleased with the gameplay , the soundtrack , the graphics , and most importantly , the plot . Who'd have thought that sneaking up to your girlfriend's window could be used to teach climbing , or her angry father opening the bedroom door the next morning to teach how to evade cops ? 
is proud to be hated by < PROPMALE > Hall . It gives him a < PROPMALE > to follow the scriptures and love his enemies . :) 
loves YouTube and Google because they enable him to find all the cool songs that he hears on the radio that they never announce ! Gosh that's annoying when they do that ... 
loves customers who are in the right holiday spirit . < PROPFIRST > Ratieta hates customers who hate the holidays and therefore go out of their way to make sure you hate them too . So much hate from those haters ... 
had a decent day at work today . Surprisingly , a lot of people who were shopping were in a rather uppity , can't-wait-for-the-holidays mood . SOME of them , however , seemed so pissed off and unsatisfied with their service that < PROPFIRST > couldn't help but feel no remorse or compassion for their crappy holiday . Wisdom comes from knowing where to direct your anger , young grasshopper . Shotgun does not snipe precision target ... 
wishes everyone a < PROPFEMALE > Christmas ! And sorry , Mr. Chauvanist Guy , but I'm not laughing at your coarse jokes that come at the expense of your wife ! Especially when she's on the verge of tears because you mistreat her so ... 
loves the phrase from a very successful acquaintance of his : \A Nerd is somebody who knows how to enjoy life to the fullest without caring what other people think . \"" 
woke up sick today and later plans on scheduling a doctor's appointment . :\\ 
just realized that when you're sick , you spend a lot of time on Facebook ... 
was out for a walk one day when a stranger suddenly waved at him excitedly . After a few seconds , the stranger quickly caught up with < PROPFIRST > and said , \Oh ! I'm so sorry ! I thought you were someone else ! \ " . < PROPFIRST > responded : \ " I am . \"" 
is still sick today , hence , he is back on Facebook/the Internet on his laptop where he will probably burn the next six hours of the day as the kleenex piles higher in the garbage can and his head continues to slightly throb . There remain a few fiction books on his bookshelf that have yet to be read , and Ezio could use some plot advancement in Assassin's Creed 2 ... He feels like < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Stevenson . 
is getting very sick of the fact that management at his work refuses to even give . 01% c o-o peration in helping him move to another department and the fact that other jobs out there are either scams or require a Bachelor's Degree which < PROPFIRST > doesn't have , yet . If he has to spend more time at Wal-Mart , he's going to slip away from sanity and become a vegetable that can only eat , enter price codes , and sleep . RRRR !!!! 
is still having viral symptoms . Bleggh ! 
wants Zac to know that he still owes < PROPFIRST > a lunch ; it doesn't count if you make the person who helped you pay for their own lunch . You gotta buy it for them ... 
wants everyone to know that Zac still owes him a lunch . It doesn't count if the person who helped you still has to buy their own way ; you might as well tell them they're in charge of buying their own Christmas presents . It's not the same ... 
wishes you would step back from that ledge , my friend . You could cut ties with all the lies that you've been living in . And if you do not wish to see him again , he would understand . He would understand ... 
just realized that if your only friend is < PROPMALE > from MySpace , that's pretty sad . 
' s left headphone just broke ! :( SADFACE ! Now he needs to buy new headphones ! 
enjoyed watching a fresh episode of < PROPMALE > ! He's off to buy the 2nd season to catch up ! Then it'll be time for some Resident Evil with Zackie Poohead . :P 
thoroughly enjoyed watching Season Two of < PROPMALE > last night with his good friend after a little bit of Resident Evil and goofing off . Such hotness from < PROPFEMALE > Strahovski . Only problem is Zac refuses to let the zombies turn into Crimson Heads , which would be so awesome ! He thinks its annoying every time I say that , too . :P 
thinks that in addition to Crimson Head Zombies , Capcom definitely needs to remake Resident Evils 2 and 3 with epic graphics AND ( don't miss this part ) creatures that turn into Crimson-everything after laying dormant for a few turns . Think about it ; Crimson Dogs , Crimson Hunters , Crimson Insects , and even a Crimson Elephant from the Elephant you encounter along the way . Now how cool would THAT be ? :D 
has been browsing on YouTube for no important reason for a while and he can't help but smile at music videos from the 80s . There are two terms which define music videos from the 80s : ' Random ' and ' Low Budget ' . Example , during a love song , two members of the Knights ' Templar guarding a sand castle in California . A guy dressed in Zebra-striped pants flying across a room on a string that is clearly visible . Nice ... 
has been rather sad lately . He feels that despite the fact that he's 23 years old , he still struggles with a lack of social competency . This has nothing to do with girls , he assures you , but rather with people in general . Just when he thinks he's got it down , another obstacle presents itself , making < PROPFIRST > wonder if he's just been living a huge lie . If he has , it hasn't been the first time . Question is , where to now ? 
is glad to have good friends who are there for him . To him , friendship is more valuable than all the treasure in the world . After all , what's the point of having treasure if you have no one to enjoy it with ? Friends > Treasure , by far . 
is still very unsure with what he wants to do with his life . Many options , but which one is the best for him ? 
just had an epiphany about what life is all about . If a friend of his can handle fatherhood at the same age , surely < PROPFIRST > can handle taking care of himself as a single guy . Interesting ... 
just found out from his Grandma today that the reason he was born by Caesarian Section was because his head was too big to ... you know ... FIT . Go me and my big head ! And , uh , sorry Mom . My bad ... 
just realized that BYU's mascot can also be termed as an old lady who dresses and wears make-up like a young lady hoping to decieve , date and eventually get laid by a young man in his 20s . Yay ! Go Cougars ! :P 
has been contemplating a few options ... and he's almost willing to go straightforward with one in particular that he hopes may take his life to a more adventurous direction . ;) 
still plans on his adventurous route , and he's a pretty cool guy . Eh kills aleins and doesnt afraid of anythign . :D 
drove through the lush , northeastern New-England countryside and was enjoying the rather overcast weather . His stomach began to feel empty , and he checked the side of the road for signs of any restaurants . Suddenly , in the distance , he noticed a rather large , vintage manor and a nice cozy town behind it . Surely that must be a place to eat ! He smiled . The sign then read : \Jerusalem's Lot\ " . ERRRR ! He kept driving ... " 
still wishes he could Parkour like Altair . How cool would that be ? Some girl : \OH NO ! My cat has somehow mysteriously climbed up the Wells Fargo building and is trapped on the roof ! \ " < PROPFIRST > : \ " Dun worry . It's K ! \ " * Starts at the Salt Lake Library then jumps higher and higher from building to building until he reaches top of Wells Fargo building then rescues cat * Girl : \ " My Hero ! \ " * < PROPFIRST > grins slyly * " 
Good evening gentleman . Negate all you know . All your Facebook are belong to me . Make your time . Someone set up us the virus . 
wants to know why there are weird noises happening around the front room near the front door . Is someone trying to break into the house ? If so , they better be ready to take a swift , grapefruit-sized fist to the face ! 6'4\ and 350+ LBS ? Better be ready to get tackled and sat upon ! " 
asks : You ever have those days where you wake up later than usual and for some reason everything seems like a dream and all the things that had some form of priority on your mind are pushed away to the very back ? To me it's very soothing , but it also throws everything in question . Anybody feel the same ? 
has an interesting mind . There are some days where his mind is constantly rehashing reasons for this and reasons for that . On other days , his mind suddenly decides its time to stop thinking and start doing ! Tonight has been the first night where he's been conscious of crossing that border between the two . :) 
Deep in < PROPFIRST > night ... I am looking for some fun . Deep in < PROPFIRST > night ... I am looking for some love . Deep in < PROPFIRST > night ... I am looking for some fun . Deep in < PROPFIRST > night ... I am looking for some [ beep ! ] ... 
is laughing after last night's description of a Redneck Utopia where all the intellgent people were exterminated via genocide or fled from the country . Apparently there was a great civil war that followed between Wal-Mart and Costco , to which Costco eventually won and is now the only retail store in the whole country . Taco < PROPFEMALE > is the only fast food restaurant , and water has been outlawed in place of Gatorade ... 
ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ 
still doesn't understand why they keep fixing Facebook when it clearly isn't broken ... now he has to learn the icons all over again . 
FACEBOOK ! YOU ARE SUCH A FAIL ! I go to look up people and all you do is take me to Groups ! Then you refuse to switch back ! ARGH ! 
is hoping this next paycheck will have sufficient funds ; the last one was kind of short . :\\ 
has some big plans . They have yet to come to fruition , but they will be in motion within the upcoming weeks . 
really needs a happier picture than what he's got there . That picture was seriously like six years ago ... * Checks files * 
Ahh there we go . Much better . 
closes with this final note . < PROPFIRST > loves his Dad , but he doesn't want to become an introversive anti-social silently-depressed individual who has all his angry feelings bottled up waiting for the moment to explode . I think it's time for a change . The life I live right now isn't quite at the level I'd like it to be . 
is glad to have a Math professor who actually knows Math to the point that he can explain everything in simply a few sentences and then showing it on the board . Before this Math professor , factoring the difference and sum of cubes was hard . Now with this Math professor , < PROPFIRST > has the whole process memorized after a few math problems ... 
no sabia que se habia roto su chip de lenguaje y solo puede hablar el Espanol ya . Como puede pasar eso ? Piensa el que quizas habia < PROPFEMALE > P.E. ( Pulso Electromagnetico ) que se frito a toda su computadora internalizada . Bueno , por ser < PROPFEMALE > Android que solo puede hablar el Espanol , su < PROPFEMALE > no es tan mala . Ahora vamos a ver como la podemos reparar ... 
is _____________________ . ( Your word here . ) 
doesn't understand what it is with certain people . One day they're your best friend for a year , then the next they start giving you the cold shoulder . Does < PROPFIRST > understand the possible reasons why ? Yes . But in his opinion , friendship shouldn't be such a high-maintenance thing . If you're friends , you're friends . Anything else isn't true friendship ... 
is currently watching the Women's Biathlon and is very impressed with the sport , but he has just one question . How did people come up with Biathlon ? Seriously , you ski like three < PROPMALE > cross country then drop prone and pull out your SNIPER RIFLE and take out a series of targets , then off to the races again . If you're doing Biathlon but not for sport , that means you've got a real problem on your hands 
poses a question . Which would you rather choose ? A Cardiovascular Surgeon with an impeccable record and reputation who is lacking in social skills or a relatively new Cardiovascular Surgeon who's fairly new but simply charming ? 
poses another question . If you were a soldier engaged in an active battlefield and your helicopter gets shot down , you notice that only one other member of the crew has survived the crash but is injured , and the enemy is making rapid progress towards your position and you only have time to find one item , which one would it be : a map or a radio ? ( And yes , this IS based on a true story ) . 
says : \There's a saying that says that people who live in glass houses should never throw stones . < PROPFIRST > says how ' bout nobody throws stones ... \"" 
just took a killer Math exam today and felt like he ACED IT ! :D However , only time will tell the true results ... 
is the type of person where still waters run deep . Just because he's not fake , materialistic or likes to gossip against his best friends on a daily basis doesn't mean he's someone not worth listening to . And yet , the thing he loves about people who solely judge based on first impressions is that it serves as an automatic filter ; everybody who knows and loves < PROPFIRST > does so because they truly MEAN IT .

has taken some time for reflection over these last two years and has realized who his true friends are . Thanks you guys . You are ruels so hard . And as for those who have severed ties with < PROPFIRST > . * Turns < PROPFEMALE > * There . That's what happens . 
says : If you fail , get up . The true difference between success and failure is not determined by one's circumstances so much as ones REACTION to those circumstances . Hence the mystery is explained as to why certain ones with great potential never grow and ones with small potential go on to achieve great things . If you have two talents and another has five , who cares ? Go to the money changers and soon youll have double 
says : \OH ! Oops ! This isn't where I parked my car ... \ " :P " 
' s Facebook profile was hacked by some CERTAIN PERSON , hint hint nudge nudge cough cough , so if anybody else noticed some weird statements coming out , you can be assured they weren't mine . 
says sometimes you just have to follow your heart . 
JUST SAW THAT HURT LOCKER BEAT OUT AVATAR FOR BEST PICTURE ! :D NOW HE HAS TO SEE IT ! Oh yeah , and , sometimes you have to follow your heart . 
sometimes wonders if there's a double standard in all of us . For example , today there are certain people who make < PROPFIRST > rather angry and upset , and < PROPFIRST > can totally visualize scenarios where them failing would equal < PROPFIRST > laughing . Yet , when it comes to those dear to him , < PROPFIRST > wants the best for them . But wouldn't that be considered a double standard ? Maybe that's why the Savior teaches us to love our enemies ... 
has found that even French Goths are weird and fruity compared to the rest of the Goths around the world . 
has so many questions still yet unanswered , and contrary to the usual norm where people know what to do in temporal situations but have no idea about the more philosophical or religious realm , I'm exactly the opposite . I'm very confident about my answers regarding religion and philosophy , but its the temporal stuff that always has me wondering . What to do in such-and-such a situation . Weird . 
doesn't need to get a life ; he has unlimited lives ! :D 
is debating between two shor t-t erm dreams . A new drum set or build a new computer . Both cost anywhere between $800-$1000 . < PROPFIRST > can only do one after his tax return . Computer seems more useful and fascinating , but drum set seems more likely to join band and attract women . What to do , what to do ... 
thinks girls who are hot and super-high-maintenance and rude to other people aren't very hot at all . In fact they are very NOT hot ... 
has to go to school tomorrow ... oh wait , no , he doesn't! :D ( Happy face ) .

just thought from reading < PROPFIRST>'s post that if ever a Zombie Apocalypse were to break out , his weapon of choice would be a Black Hawk Helicopter that could run on a specialized engine of Vegetable Oil ( so as to always have a place to refuel by raiding abandoned supermarkets ) . < PROPMALE > Paull and I would work out the scematics for the engine , and Zac and < PROPMALE > could each have their own . 50 cal . 
avoided a mistake and learned that because you feel a certain way doesn't mean it's meant to be that way permanently . Things change . In fact , the only known constant in the universe is change . But coming back to how it relates to normal life , just because you may feel strong emotion about something doesn't mean it's wise to share it . You must first decide what the consequences will be and use your best judgment . 
is looking to move out . Anybody know of any places that are available for a reasonable price where people won't stab or maim you if you come home after 8:00 P.M. ? 
wants you all to haz a rice day , preeze . 
is totally digging this song he's been dying to hear for a long time that he finally learned the title to so he could finally look it up ! :D 
had a lot of fun at iHop last night ( tonight ?? ) . He needs to get some sleep now or he will undoubtedly be starting his day off painfully slow . Everybody have a great night . 
is tired and should really get some sleep . 
' s right headphone is dying . Sadface ... :( 
doesn't quite understand where they got the term \Butt Rock\ " from the 80's but he supposes its because when you see an 80's \ " Butt\ " Rocker the first thing you think of is a person's ass ... uggghh . ;( " 
is tired and wants to take a nap before going to work . Mmm . Zzz ... 
is listening to the soundtrack for Return of the < PROPMALE > and loves the last bit of the song for Minas Tirith . Such an epic fanfare with strings providing the background . Too bad < PROPMALE > Shore passed away , unless I've got my facts wrong . Such an epic modern-day composer . 
r gonz to goes gets his Netbooks with External Hard Drives and talks to his moms about cell phone plans . 1337 . Do not r makes funs of his Englishes , he r heres to t33ch u's corrects princippals . 
has been rethinking his financial strategy . Perhaps the netbook can wait ; you can always save money for a netbook . But with a cell phone , plus tax return , he could be set for at least ten months or so with the plan he wants plus the phone he wants . The cell phone seems like a bigger necessity . I dunno ; has it dawned on anybody that I think out loud a lot on Facebook ? 
its final . Phone first , then accessories later . < PROPFIRST > r buys phone with plans today . ( Verizon ) . 
is now officially an owner of a cell phone . He will give you his new number sometime soon . 
gets his phone this Monday . Can't wait . 
Die Hard Marathon involving Life Free Die Hard followed by the original Die Hard from 1988 ? PRICELESS ! 
just found out that Assassins Creed was loosely based off a famous Croation novel written in 1938 about the Assassins stationed at the famous fortress of Alamut . Similarities ? Oppressive empire wages war on the Assassin order , leader of the Assassins summons his best assassin , the asssassin eventually kills head of the oppressive empire , only to find that his master is the true culprit , kills master . Sound familiar ? 
tried talking with his new home teaching companion this Sunday and has a feeling he's in for a LONG haul . You know the type of people who live in their little Mormon bubble where if you don't look like a BYU-grad and you don't live in a nice fancy HGTV house with an SUV in the driveway then you're not worth talking to in their eyes ? That appears to be my new home teaching companion . Oh boy ... 
just noticed that even in Spanish , girls like to talk to make their words \cute\ " . In this case they add \ " ito\ " and \ " ita\ " to a lot of words . " 
is eager to hear your stories as to what happened in his profile picture . :P 
has a comment about today's whether : \Go to hell . Stupid effing Snowbound . \"" 
just discovered < PROPFIRST > Satriani tonight and hasn't stopped listening to his stuff on Pandora and YouTube . Have you ever discovered an artist who's music totally becomes the soundtrack of your life ? < PROPFIRST > Satriani did that for me .

has had a wonderful day but now he needs to go to sleep . Goodnight everyone ! 
is tired and perhaps needs some rest . There's a lot on my mind and I'm going to take a nap and think things over . 
RAM on the drives , Ram on the grille ... 
has once again arrived at a crossroads that goes in every direction . The advantage ? < PROPFIRST > can take the time to decide exactly where and when he wants to go . The disadvantage ? If < PROPFIRST > doesn't come to a choice , some roads will close over time . Decisions decisions . 
had a dream but then he woke up and forgot about it and probably won't remember it until some random occurrence triggers the memory two years from now . 
has been getting some stuff done around the house and is grateful for Loratadine . Twice the Claritin for half the price . Yay Hay Fever season !.... 
Ahhhh . It feels so good to be caught up on homework . 
No thank you , guy in the library . If you want to talk on your cell phone that's great but that doesn't mean you can talk in a loud voice and laugh as loud as you want , especially if your location is dead center in the middle of the building where everyone is either trying to study or use the computers . There's a more subtle function called texting , you know . 
Ahh really , clock ? It can't be almost time to go to work already ... Liar ! The clock lies ! 
has been watching Fullmetal Alchemist and thinks that < PROPMALE > Elric is the coolest little brother ever ! And < PROPFIRST > Tennant will always be the best Doctor Who . Too bad he's no longer the Doctor ... 
Grabbed the wrist of the would-be Assassin and twisted it against its natural direction . He then kicked his heel into the small of the man's back as the assailant dropped his silenced pistol . Thrusting the killer into the wall , < PROPFIRST > quickly snatched the pistol and fired three piercing shots , one between the eyes . The lifeless human mass dropped with a thud . Another close call ... 
reclined in his beachside chair that had been warmed by the sun and was smooth and supple against his skin . The waves crashed ever-so-gently and the sky was clear with only a few clouds beyond the horizon that added to the beautiful scenery . He put his sunglasses on and reached for the Virgin Strawberry Daquiri next to him that was ice cold . \I love days off ... \ " he muttered as he slowly sipped ... " 
just heard the most epic phrase from the person sitting behind him in the computer lab , talking to his friend . \Sometimes I'm like Uwe Boll . I corrupt everything I touch . \""

WHAT THE -- go to hell . Stupid effing snowbound . Veto this shiz you a-holes ! 
has slept most of the day feeling miserable because of his cold/flu whatever you want to call it . Hopefully he'll get more sleep tonight . His body feels hot , his head aches , his sinuses and nose are about to explode , and his ears only pop half the time and throw his equilibrium off . Blegh ...

threw the rock at Clayworth's face ! In a split-second , the mercenaries surrounding him opened fire , but it was one split-second too late . To their surprise , all of them fell to the ground fatally wounded . < PROPFIRST > had fallen to the ground with the lunge of his throw . His captors , their guns trained on him , had opened fire and , as a result , had all shot themselves . < PROPFIRST > remained prone , a clever smile on his face 
Just had his first day of Summer semester and it felt pretty dang good . He's found that the secret to feeling good about oneself is to do something worthwhile .

is a bit scared right now . He just noticed that someone from his past who loathes him and has the drive , determination and mentality of a serial killer just got a Facebook account . Anybody know how to set one's entire profile to \Private \"?" 
is going to be on the down low for a while . 
approached the old , abandoned cabin in the wilderness . It was dark , and the wind blew with a certain howling that kept his hairs raised and at full alert . It looked as though the cabin had been abandoned for years , maybe decades . But then , a familiar yet terrifying falling of pebbles could be heard in the distance ; the murderer was still on his trail . Afraid that his breathing might be heard , < PROPFIRST > made for the cabin .

finds himself in a bit of a character rut . Five years ago people thought I was boring for being too mature . Now I've lightened up and have attempted to establish and find my own identity and now people are saying I'm annoying for being immature . There's just no pleasing you people , is there ? >:| You know what ? Screw it , I'm doing my own thing now . Behold my tongue as I quietly release it in your direction . >:P 
thinks its time to get his life in order . Dreams , like all things mortal and time-based , are like seasons . < PROPFIRST > figures that postponing what you want most for what you want now is like waiting until the end of September to buy your swimsuit . Summer's gone , Fall is halfway over , and it will be only a short amount of time before Winter settles in ( Utah Weather aside ) . By then , you'll feel like its too late . 
has decided its better to be an honest sinner than a lying saint . Not to say that he WANTS to be a sinner , but if I had to choose between the two , I'd say that my chances of getting into heaven would be better if I accepted and lived by the truth than by a lie and a cover-up . Not to mention the truth eventually sets a man free , whether in this life or the next ...

stared coldly through the rain bands as they reflected the Bern nightlife in Switzerland . The hardest part about being an operative for the United States Government was that even the closest friends could someday become one's enemy . But it was more personal this time . This time a close friend had tortured and killed another close friend . < PROPFIRST > had no choice . He slowly pulled out his silenced . 45 ... and cocked it . 
literally just pulled an all-nighter to finish up on his homework and study for today's exam , which he felt went very well thanks to the elongated cramming . Two Five-Hour-Energies , 103 textbook pages , 30 sheets written on both sides , one exam and 11 hours later , < PROPFIRST>'s going to be sleeping until work time . I can now officially call myself a college student . Woo-hoo-uh ... uhhh . * Collapses * 
:( 
is preparing ... 
just got done with class today . Now its off to make some plans with his advisor , check out the Student Employment office for a possible paid internship opportunity , possibly do some homework , and then see if he can head to his Mom's house to start planning his attack on the huge clutter heap . That and he just had the best vacation ever last weekend . :D ( Happy Face ) . 
learned today that on his own , he is only quick enough to lose an extremity without damaging the internal organs ( figuratively speaking ) . It is only when he acknowledges that he needs help from above that he can actually dodge life's bullets . 
is tired and going to go to bed . Goodnight everyone . 
flopped down on the hardwood flooring of the loft apartment as blood slowly oozed from the wound in his clavicle . He could only thank his maker that the sniper had used a light round , one that offered a small < PROPMALE > for survival . As quickly as he could , he pulled himself across the floor to the bathroom . Ripping his shirt off , he pulled himself up to the sink , threw open the mirror , and found what he needed ... 
Maybe when I get my next Credit Card statement , I'll just reply with a handwritten letter that simply reads : \Luke 6 : 34 \"." 
Ever walk into a restaurant and have some random patron just give you the MEANEST look ever ? That just happened a few minutes ago . A bit disconcerting ... 
I find that most of the limitations we encounter are the ones we set ourselves . If the canvas is large , and the paint is still fresh , why not make use of it all ? 
has discovered that after being tagged in a few photographs , its probably time to start losing some weight . His profile picture is a far stretch from his actual size . But one day ... one day < PROPFIRST > can be like that pseudo-photo of him kicking some bad-guy butt in the Himalayas trying to defend a friendly and indigenous mountain village from a siege of wealthy treasure-hunters and mercenaries ... ( Uncharted , anybody ? ) 
is dealing with a minor dillemma right now . Question is , is it wise , or no ? Time will tell , I guess . 
is hanging in there . Hopefully , everything will be resolved . 
Ahh , good . Resolved . Now < PROPFIRST > can rest easy . 
found out last night that he can multi-socialize at iHop at 1:30 in the morning . :D 
Ahh , Motley Crue never sounded so awesome like on headphones like these ! :D 
\It takes skills to be real and try and heal each other . \ " \

is more impressed with < PROPFIRST > Westin with every episode he watches . 
Nooooo ! Work at 5:00 and its 4:23 ! But ... but ... but I want to watch one more episode ... :( 
is currently listening to music from the Rocketeer . Such an epic movie that was back in the day . 
just realized that he forgot to backup his resumes to his external Hard Drive when he moved from Holladay to < PROPMALE > . Now instead of proofread , edit , save , paste ( or in some cases , proofread , edit , copy , paste ) , < PROPFIRST > has to type his resume all over again . ARRRGH !! 
No mas . No mas . 
guesses he should really get in the habit of taking his phone off silent mode . Missed calls can be a bad thing ... 
is so happy that < PROPMALE>'s computer will be fixed for free . Does he use it ? No . He just likes to hop on the bandwagon for status updates ... 
FIXED ! Finally , < PROPMALE > can use a computer whenever he wants , Sigh ... 
Man who buys vehicle and weapons in times of war can match enemy . But man who steals vehicle filled with weapons leaves enemy unarmed , on foot , and saves money . 
has officially discovered that he can eat his entire lunch with a plastic knife from the coffee cupboard . Why , you might ask ? Because that's what happens when you get all the way to the break room and realize you forgot your utensils ... 
You know you lost it at some point today when you go to get a glass of milk and you find your dog's tennis ball in the fridge ... 
officially got abducted tonight . Two words . < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > . 
Just took a three hour nap . Ahhh , epic . Mmmm . Like being born into a new realm of existence . 
Ahh man , Jimi Hendrix never sounded so good like on headphones like these . It's no joke ; listen to Jimi Hendrix and you will see where < PROPFIRST > Frusciante from the Red Hot Chili Peppers and < PROPFIRST > Mayer get their style from . Huh , funny . Both named < PROPFIRST > . Weird . I think in addition to < PROPMALE > Vallin's epic Spanish flamenco-style pop guitar , I've found a new influence to implement into my playing . 
must have been super hungry today . That's the fastest Barbacoa burrito I've ever eaten . ( 5 Mins ) . Cleanly , too . Not even a < PROPMALE > to take a sip of Dr. Pepper . 
Man with awesome car , crappy attitude = douchebag idiot with tons of debt . Man with crappy car , awesome attitude = Trend setter . 
is truly grateful for his ability to walk and run and the full use of his arms , but ... being asked to go outside to push carts in the heat is still gay ... 
has apparently become the target of some new drama at work that he knows nothing about . What do you do in those situations ? The wimpy thing is to get involved . The intelligent thing is to pretend like nothing's happening , go to work with a big smile on your face , and watch as they all become dumbfounded as the rumors melt and wash away like water . ;) 
just discovered the pros and cons of taking your dog with you for a ride . Pros : Happy Dog . Cons : Back seat covered in dog hair . Oh wellz . Live and learn ... 
Weekend house sitting has been pretty chill . And last night was fun thanks to < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE > . All of you who are friends of mine rock ! ;) 
Dear Lord , why tonight , of all nights , does my neighbor three houses down have to be having a high school party where some po-dunk band of 16-year-olds are trying to cover the Beach Boys and < PROPFIRST > Mancini and failing miserably ? WHHHYYYYYY ??? * Buries face in hands * . 
has discovered that if there's one thing he likes about the music he's amassed over the years , its the fact that he has music for any and every type of mood he's in . If I'm sad , I've got music that helps soothe the soul . If I'm angry or upset , I've got music that channels the rage and < PROPFEMALE > to implode . And , best of all , on those days where everything's going fine , I've got plenty of songs to celebrate to . 
es lo mas humilde que hay . Soy tan humilde que no hay < PROPFEMALE > que se puede comparecer . Soy lo mejor a ser humilde ; lo mejor humilde que hay ! Tan humilde que todos se jactan de cuan humilde soy ! :P :D 
Ahh , classic . Good times . 
is contemplating a lot of things right now . What to do , what to do ? 
has never seen a head-banging dog before ... until now . The story ? Okay , so I was goofing off with my dog playing tug-o-war with this little tire toy she has when I let go to let her win . All of a sudden the tire toy rebounds back from my hand and flips over and wraps around her head . Being completely blind and caught off-guard , tah-dah ! A head banging dog . Funniest thing I've seen in a long time . 
Uggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhh ... I don't wanna go to work today . > ; 0 
Agrees with Jenn . Next time , I'll just call in pregnant ... :P 
Any girl who knows her Classic Rock scores high in the book of < PROPFIRST > ... 
Totally found the End Credits song to Echelon Conspiracy . Definitely going to listen to it while out for a walk/working out . ;D 
You know a friend has had tremendous influence when the first thing you say when you charge your phone is : \I r puts you on the charge-charge \"..." 
predicts that he and < PROPMALE > Paull will become heros after our Open Source and Freedom of Information revolution that unites the world in knowledge and culture . Then we'll live our dreams and meet every weekend at the Autobahn to catch up and play some real-life Forza . You in , < PROPMALE > ? 
has always been branded as one thing or the other . Truth is , I'm all of them at once . It just depends on what mood I'm in and what my objectives are . I find its better that way . A special thanks to my close friends for being there for me through the good times and the bad . You are the reason I don't disappear into the void from whence few men ever return . Don't worry , I'm not sad . Just pensive tonight ... 
Holy crap , that IS a short mailman ! 
definitely wants to see how his Zerg have evolved over the years . If StarCraft 2 still has the ability to spawn Zerglings within 30 seconds , I'm going to cry ... 
Hooray for divorce !!! Hey , at least those of us who grew up with it know what NOT to do ... 
Stuck between two worlds , the prospect of one , the surety of another . Mind now calculating the best course of action . Did I play my cards right ? Was there something I missed ? Pack my bags and prepare to embark into the great unknown . Mind as ready as ever . Heart fragile , but undaunted . Steps . Walking . Pushing myself forward . No point in turning back now ... 
Old-fashioned version : \Enthusiasm in the workplace is contagious ! \ " \ 
just had an epiphany . ( GASP !! ) It appears that there are two conflicting parties , those who believe hard work overrides talent , and those who believe that talent can outsmart and innovate over hard work . < PROPFIRST>'s thought ? They both go hand in hand . Hard work is necessary to develop new talents , but talent , in turn , is the application of what was learned from hard work . Rather than nemeses , they are fraternal twins . 
Sadness is taking the time to prepare , season , and cook some epic hamburger patties ... only to find the last of the bread and buns were finished last night ... 
has been pondering much during his errands today and he's finally come to the realization : \Time to nut up or shut up . \"" 
\Ah-CHOOO ! \ " \ 
submits : \It's always a plus when you find yet another friend who likes Supernatural . \ " :D " 
Not gonna lie . I feel pretty crappy this morning . :( 
They've paved paradise , and put up a parking lot . 
New term for the day : \Pari-partum Cardiomyopathy\ " . Heart failure due to post-natal exertion . A manager at my work has a wife in the ICU . Hoping for the best ... " 
Oh wow , do ANY of you realize how entertaining it is to drive around at night listening to Disturbed on loud during a LIGHTNING STORM ? HIGHLY recommended ! :D 
, with regards and thanks to Bry , is so glad it isn't/wasn't just him ... ;) 
Out for a walk again , this time with current music plus Ok Go . \Kk gogogogo \"..." 
finds that he tends to be very outgoing . Outgoing meaning 99% of all his phone calls and conversations are outgoing only . Hence the unanswered calls and voicemail that's been completely filled for quite some time now . :P 
You will never know what < PROPFIRST > is thinking . ;) 
did something today he normally doesn't do . Not knowing what to eat , and not having much at home , he drove to < PROPFEMALE>'s for lunch and ... got a salad instead . On top of that he ordered a large water and finished the salad without the dressing . Why ? He has no clue . But while his wallet might be a little upset , his mind and body feel unusually ... good . Yes I did it ! :D 
Anybody else feel like their ears just naturally thwart any and every design of earbud ? It makes my brain sad . Brain wants close , personal music so bad ... 
needs to put off the Ranger ... 
Know what's awesome about subbing for a Door Greeter later into the night ? You get to spin around on the chair when the crowd is dead ... :D 
Uh oh , Friday the 13th . Better pray you're not a Knights ' Templar ... 
has nothing to say right now . But he made sure to post it on Facebook via phone . That's not obsessive ... :P 
Hmmm , well , definitely not Fruity Pebbles , that's for sure ... 
It's funny how cultures vary in what they value most . You don't even have to visit certain countries to find that out , either . Just watch a good , popular American movie and then switch to a popular , high rated Japanese Anime and note the difference . Americans seem to value fun and social success . The Japanese seem to value knowledge of the highest clarity and quality , self-mastery and self-awareness . Interesting ... 
can actually watch his movie from Netflix before going to work today ! :D HOORAY !

now believes that H.F. truly sends angels along the way when you need them most but you least expect it . He just had a conversation in Spanisjwith an employee he barely knows who turned out to be one of the first native Sister Missionaries in Northern Peru . Her South American-style faith has once again boosted < PROPFIRST>'s to the point where he can't deny it . 
AHHHHH this Barbacoa ... 
Ever feel like you've come to a crossroads ? Ever feel like you're on the threshold of something ? Well today I feel like both , like I've come to a crossroads on the threshold of some new beginning . Question is , which path do I take ? It appears that this earthly existence we experience now is like a blank piece of paper , and we are the cartographers . The engineers of our salvation and the navigators of our < PROPFEMALE > . 
wants to know , after reading Bry's link about a ridiculously priced watch , why the CIA is spending billions of dollars sending Economic Hitmen to foreign countries to negotiate deals under the table for US economic supremacy when they can just target all the unintelligent , materialistic douchebag billionaires that are found WITHIN the economy . Best part ? No high-tech intelligence needed ! Just pick up a copy of Forbes 
Look , there are very few things in this life you can be absolutely sure of , and one of them is the fact that you will never learn absolutely everything about everything during this mortal probationary period . In fact , the only way to be ready for anything is to accept this fact . In truth , nothing is ever as it seems ... we can only base them on patterns and see if they share the same behavior . 
thinks its always fun when you find an intelli-bed mattress sample on the floor near your night stand , especially when you had no idea how it got there and it belongs to a close friend who's been searching diligently with no success . :D Don't worry , aforementioned friend . I'll bring it when I come next time .

O_o (????????????????????) ^.^ :D . Yes , that would describe how I feel today . 
Go Utes ! Pwn hard ! 1337 ! 
is going to be taking a big step tomorrow ( actually later on today , it's 2:30 in the morning ) . And this step will definitely be one that determines if he goes one way or the other . The funny thing ? < PROPFIRST > doesn't feel that bad about it ; if anything , I'm actually kinda excited ! :D 
AND ... my Border Collie just totally demolished her hedgehog toy . Way to go , < PROPFEMALE > !!! Now Hedgie has turned to Inside-Outie . Look at all this fluff ! 
peered through the lens of his sniper scope at the man who was talking on his cell phone . The man was dressed in one of Armani's finest lines with the fake tan that's associated with wealthy and wore genuine Italian shoes and Oakleys . < PROPFIRST > breathed steadily and stared with a serious look through the lens . Not only was this man an international tyrant ... he had also murdered the girl that < PROPFIRST > had loved . 
-_- ( Meditating ) . 
You know its Labor Day when your alarm goes off , you cancel it , fall back asleep , wake up at 11:00 , take a half-hour shower , put on some gym clothes that don't even match , grab your favorite breakfast burrito , drive around for a while listening to music , and then just BS the rest of the day . Sad part is I still have to work at 3:00 , but I get off at 7:00 , so you can count on more BS'ing . ;) 
How DARE you question my knowledge about < PROPFEMALE > Wars , Mr. Customer Guy ? Especially when you assume I don't know the difference between a Storm Trooper and a Snow Trooper ? The Audacity !!!... 
In response to the anti-Islam propoganda that's going around in certain parts of our country today , this is my stance . It is childish and shows a downright lack of intelligence to blame an entire society or group of people based on the bad actions of a select few . Oh wait , nevermind , that's what the Nazis used to justify their actions against the Polish , Russians , Slavs and Jews . Way to go , smart people ... 
returned to Washingon D.C. in a nice pinstripe suit that was freshly cleaned , pressed and starhed , but if one were permitted to look beneath the white shirt , they would find an agent who came this close to never making it out of Turkey alive . A slight limp that he tried to hide , < PROPFIRST > walked down the quiet halls beneath the Capitol Building , a security clearance \A\ " badge hanging from his lapel ... " 
What started out as a not-so-good day at work just got ten times better when I saw the free pie that we have due to our safety days . Free pumpkin and pecan pie !

its funny how you listen to a group now that you've heard for years , but this time the lyrics and music totally go straight through your heart . My case ? < PROPFEMALE > 6 .

Like the Buddhist Zen , don't merely seek to pretend , but finding ways and learning truths throughout my days until the end . 
Today was a very weird day . VERY weird ... 
Dude ! Kanye West = Douchebag to the tenth power ! < PROPFIRST > Swift should have had steel-toed boots or pointy heels and just kicked him in the balls . Even better , that's what her song should have been about . 
After watching Tron for the first time , I'm never deleting a program ever again . It r super sads to see what happens . :P 
IM AFRAID I CANT LET YOU DO THAT < PROPMALE > MARSH ... 
Okay , so apparently some friends have received an email from my account advertising Viagra pills . If you have been sent one of these , it was not I who sent it personally . Somebody's probably been tampering . Sorry peeps ! 
FYI to all my peeps out there ! < PROPFIRST>'s cell was completely dead throughout the majority of the day . I just decided to < PROPFEMALE > on with my stuff without it . September 16 officially became the < PROPFIRST > B . Ratieta Day of Cellular Abstinence . Nothing personal . ;) Y'all have a good night , now . 
ironed his shirt but forgot to iron his pants , but that's okay because September 17th happens to be Slightly-Wrinkled Pants Day . I shouldn't be too obtrusive ;) 
Why make movies about heists against innocent banks and financial services when they can make one about a group of guys who < PROPMALE > politicians of their campaign money that goes off the books ? Suddenly the heist goes from being a bad thing to a good thing . At least in one way it's going back to the people ... 
Life is so crazy sometimes . One day you're here doing this and everything is perfectly planned out . The next , you're on a roller coaster holding on with one hand not knowing where the heck you're going and just screaming \YEE-HAW !! \ " . And then the next you wake up in the middle of a barren desert not quite sure where to go . Ahh life . You emulate both my pain and my pleasure . " 
Ahh man . This Sunday has been going so AWESOME ! 
Printer out of ink ! Red alert ! Re-route all power to the shield generator and concentrate all firepower on that Super < PROPFEMALE > Destroyer ... Oh ! And someone stop by the Office < PROPMALE > on their way back to the bridge , please . Thank you ! 
It was just a normal day with < PROPFIRST > checking up on a few things at his computer ... when literally , not two seconds ago , a white Chevy truck careened down the road honking its lungs out chasing what appeared to be two dogs that were holding what appeared to be a freshly-killed cat . Ahhh this neighborhood . Such stories you could tell . 
has seen some good movies this year , ironically all at the same theater ( Union Heights in < PROPFIRST > ) . But hands down , by far the most entertaining , thought-provoking , cerebrally-flavorful movie of 2010 for < PROPFIRST > is Inception . And yes , I just got back from watching it . More food/sushi for thought ? After having seen Inception , read the \Lectures on Faith\ " series and you'll be amazed how much coincides ... " 
It's easy , mmmkay ! 
has determined that systematically beating his head against a brick wall would be more entertaining and uplifting than listening to the over-enthusiastic narrator on this training video ...

is a |\\|()()|3 on current events sometimes , but oh my gosh , have you checked Google Docs ? AMAZING idea ! 
Mowing the lawn is just mowing the lawn ... until you bring along Boston and Dragonforce . Then mowing the lawn becomes much more epic . 
is confused . Very confused . Maybe it's because its 2:10 AM . < PROPFIRST>'s going to bed now . Goodnight everybody . I love you all with the same love that the taste buds have for a gummy bear , or the aching back for a brand new California < PROPMALE > mattress , or the avid music listener for his 180 GB iPod , or the pushover at work for his collection of action movies that make him feel like a bad@$$ . You know what I'm talking about ... 
just discovered Invader Zim last night . Awesome show ! Too bad they cancelled it ! Freaking soccer moms ... 
Like the outcast warrior ... don't seek for riches , worldly praise , rather that the world just be a better place .

So I'll trust in love , so I'll trust in love ; its been giving me peace of mind . I ...! I feel so alive ! For the very first time ! I can't deny you ...

wants you to be his neighbor . Will you be his neighbor ? 
You know its getting late when you randomly decide to post a picture of Mr. Rogers and ask everyone via status update if they'll be your neighbor ... the whole time laughing hysterically as though it were the funniest thing in the world . 
had a girl flirt with him in a most unusual way , daresay perhaps uncomfortable . She was somewhat heavy-set , though I'm sure she has a wonderful personality , and when she came through my line she just stared and smiled for a long time . Then when it came time to pay she slid her card too fast . When I told her she had done so , she said : \Ooh ... just like my life ... I like to take it FAST ! \"" 
is going to bed now . Pray that I don't wake up in a box labeled : \Tierra < PROPMALE > Fuego \"." 
Spur-of-the-momen t-t ype thing but < PROPFIRST > is contemplating going on a computer fast . OR ... sacreligion aside , perhaps I'll start my own computer Ramadan ! Let's see . Hmm . Worthy goal ? How about ... one week without logging on the computer during the daytime ? That should still allow for < PROPFIRST > to pay bills on time afterwards . 
asks : \What about me and my blue collar ...? \ " ;) " 
is officially 24 , and he's come to terms with it . The feeding tube has to be replaced every now and then ; no biggie . His hip and knee replacements are a bit sluggish at times ; whose aren't ? The only perplexing thing is why there's a keyhole and keypad on the elevator door . Come to think of it , since when did his house have an elevator ? Oh well , at least Gandalf comes and visits ...

is currently sitting at the edge of a small river , enjoying a break from the hubbub , and he just had a realization ; an epiphany , if you will . It would appear that the path of selfishness leads to the destination of emptiness and a lack of personal worth and purpose , whereas acts of service , such as selflessness and good will towards other , leads to the path of fulfilment and a sense of worth and purpose . 
\Each time we bathe our reactions in artificial light . Each time we alter the focus to make the wrong move seem right ... \"" 
You guys know of the Nod , right ? Like when you're passing someone in the hall or the workplace that you know but you don't really have time to say anything so you just give a quick nod of acknowledgement .

Who is that desperate to go after a Cougar ? Sup Mom's college roommate ? Doin ' anything Friday night ? 
FYI to all friends and nemeses , my phone is currently non-functional . Hence all calls and texts that don't get a response should not be taken perosnally . 
Not gonna lie ; I'm really stoked ! 
has been walking naked for the last three days . Figurative or literal ? You decide . 
I always keep my wit in a holster for quick-draw situations ; problem is , the firing pin only works half the time ... >:\\ 
It isn't Mother's Day and there are those who would call me childish , immature , unmanly and a Mama's boy for saying this , but ... you gotta give my Mom a lotta credit . Why ? Because she freaking raised me ! And on top of that she raised me both during and after a , no offense , shitty marriage . So props to you , Mom ! Thanks for teaching me the values that prevent me from going to prison or the insane asylum .

loves it when people intentionally go out of their way to piss you off and it doesn't work . It only ends up pissing them off and it actually makes you laugh , which in turn makes your day a little brighter , which in turn only pisses them off even more , which in turn only continues to make your day even brighter , and so forth . Ahhh , a perpetual upward spiral of happiness . 
Big FYI to everyone out there , friends and nemeses alike , with the phone back up and running and the real-time email update error corrected , the only mess left to clean up is none of your names are associated with < PROPFIRST > . Hence if you send me a text please include your name or an inside joke so I know who you are . Otherwise there's going to be a lot of confusion ... and a lot of < PROPFIRST > showing up to wrong places/houses . 
It was a cold winter night when the Motorola Droid sat down at the back-most booth of the Sizzler that had diminished and become quiet and unpopulated . He removed his fedora cap and slowly turned to look outside the < PROPFEMALE > window , melancholy .

And if I have said or done anything that's pissed you off , well , I'm sorry , and I will do my best to be a better friend . I'll admit , my folly is I sometimes think I've got everything down and I know what I'm talking about , but frankly , it's often times quite the opposite . So thanks to all of you who make my day a little brighter . 
Maturity is relative . I'm 24 but I feel like I'm still 21 ... and still act accordingly . You know what ? Screw calendars . From now on I dictate how old I am ... 
How DARE you , Walmart ? How DARE you place WWE Smackdown on the same shelf as Force Unleashed 2 and Fable III . That's like putting a < PROPMALE > Double from Burger < PROPMALE > on the menu between the Vegas Roll and Top Sirloin . Where's the class ? The CLASS ?!

Event of the Day : So , apparently some middle-aged guy must have thought that I was Native American or something , because as I was outside he walked straight to me , raised his right arm to the square , and said : \ ....

finds that true discipleship is not determined by what's on the outside , but on the inside . True , the outside exterior may evolve and change incidentally , proportionate to the ongoing change on the inside , but if we are attempting to simply rely on our exterior appearances to create the illusion that we are changing for the better , then we will find at some later point that we have taken the wrong path .

Not gonna lie ; today was pretty shallow . It was one of those days that the child inside each of us dreads when the adult takes over and we do the exact same thing one day as we did the day before . Where's the flavor ? The challenge ? The excitement ? Gone are the days of fun as we approach adulthood ? NAY NAY , I say ! 
was about to rage upon hearing that Blender magazine rated < PROPMALE > Peart as the second-worst rock lyricist of all time ( apparently because the very idea of implementing Philosophy , Philanthropy , Anthropology , Literature , Science and Psychology into a rock song isn't considered ingenious ) , but then when he found out that the same people gave Bjork the Artist of the Year award in 2007 , he just laughed .

Okay , Salad Fingers was bugging me after a while , so I decided to find something much more epic for a profile picture ... 
Aha . I see , now . Still so much yet to learn . 
Holy cow , I just saw what I looked like when I lost all that weight . Dang . It is time . 
As time goes by , we feel that there are many things which change within us , some for the better , some for the worse .

In lieu of the ongoing Facebook trend of posting your favorite childhood cartoons , I've just had the epiphany that if you can't remember what it was like to be a kid , you're sure as hell not going to make it as an adult , much worse a parent .

Sometimes we ask ourselves why we've been placed on this particular path in our lives , why it is we have to face THIS obstacle while others we know get a nice easy walk during this leg of the journey . And yet , if there truly is no other way , and we are obligated to face the obstacle , we find that its the obstacles we face in life that make us who we are . All of us products of our trials and hardships . 
got the rare opportunity to actually conduct a job interview today . Reason ? Biligual .

has some demons he has to face again . Geez , where are the Winchesters when you need them ? 
feels much better now . Thanks guys . ;) I just needed a pick-me-up . 
has found out some things that he didn't know before . Interesting ... 
FYI everybody , if you're wondering why you havent received a reply text from < PROPFIRST > , its because his charger is still somewhere at < PROPMALE>'s house . So take no offense . < PROPFIRST > will have it back up and running soon enough . ;) 
Society's version : \If you fail to plan 
And once again , < PROPFIRST>'s phone is currently AFK , but it should be up and running by tomorrow . 
Hey , F.Y.I. , < PROPFEMALE > Christmas < PROPFEMALE > , everybody ! Hope your Christmas < PROPFEMALE > goes fan-freaking-tastic . 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas , everybody !! 
Nothing quite like coming back to work from Christmas and instead of saying \I hope you had a good Christmas\ " you end up splurging \ " Merry Christmas\ " 3 days late " 
Man , can I just say how awesome sweat pants feel ? Its like the non-gay version of spandex that's just as limber . I feel like Aladdin in these bad boys . 
is currently eating a bowl of Cheerios . I know ! Like , stop ! Whoa now ! Now you can all go on with your lives in peace and relief knowing that important piece of information . Mr. Secretary , tell the President that < PROPFEMALE > is safe again . 
Who needs a college degree and related certifications when you can just be a door greeter at Wal Mart ? Duh ! 
Its been five years to the day since I entered the MTC , and all I can think about right now is how glad I am I didn't turn out like the computer tech guy played by < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > on SNL . If it wasn't for my mission , I would have turned out like that guy . 
Still wearing my sweats . Yep , they're that comfy . Oooh , now < PROPFIRST > has a craving for Hot Chocolate . 
The only service done in vain is service with a crappy attitude . And when you start an argument with someone , remember to tell them not to listen to the fool that's arguing with them . 
[ Facebook Update ] 
wants to thank his close friends for being with and uplifting him for yet another year in 2010 . I highly doubt I'll ever be able to repay for the good laughs and shelter from the storms you've provided me with , but the least I can do right now at this stage in life is at least say thanks . So thanks guys . I appreciate it . 
is afraid he can't let you do that , < PROPMALE > Marsh . 
Ahh man , Bourne Identity is such a 1337 show . 
is currently pondering what appears to be a wealth vs . common sense ratio that seems more and more apparent here at Wal-Mart . Thus far the graph appears to be in the shape of a < PROPFEMALE > Curve . Today I encountered what would be the far end of the graph as a function of wealth . Lots of money , lots of whimsical requests , and tons of complaints . 
can't seem to find a Tennis Ball for his dog ... and his dog is getting super pissed about it ... 
Have you ever played a video game where you level up and learn a new skill , such as Archery or Lock Picking or [ Crazy Magic Trick That Kills All Your Enemies Within Fifty Yards] ? Well if you ever manage to survive a number six from Tea < PROPFEMALE > , it feels the same way . < PROPFIRST > Ratieta learned \Tongue Resistance\ " +1 . " 
realizes now that < PROPFEMALE > is more a matter of choice , not circumstance . True , we can't change the past itself , and some things are not our fault though we may have payed dearly for them , but the secret is to see with < PROPFEMALE > and not mere eyesight . We must increase our range of sight and ability to understand , not decrease . Only in such a way can we progress , and not recede . 
Ahh ! The morning ! 
RAWR ! 
is a bit under the weather today . And I mean a BIT ... 
is still sick but rocking the Ibuprofens and large amounts of water and Vitamin C . Rock and roll ! 
First day of school . Ahh , its good to be back . 
Know what the coolest damn thing about school today was ? ( And pardon the language , but it was THAT cool . ) My American Sign Language teacher ... is actually deaf ! And yet despite that he gave the most effective presentation and even had a few of us laughing . Disability ? Pfff ! Today I learned that for some its actually a talent . And he's the friendliest guy . < PROPMALE > Kinner FTW . 
No status update for you . Come back in one year . 
Off to my Math class in Boondock Relocatable-ville again . Hope I don't die as I cut across every parking lot filled with student drivers competing for a space .. 
is battling a cough that's making him turn to the < PROPFIRST > Bowers strategy . For the first time ever , I will be attempting to sleep in a leather recliner ... 
likes his status update . 
has flu-induced pneumonia , just FYI , so if you only hear from him via Facebook or text , that's why . Love you all , though . ;) And it gun b k . 
apparently has a long lost twin brother named < PROPMALE > from the new YouTube Zombie Series : \Bite Me \"." 
is currently shaking his fist rather vehemently at < PROPFEMALE > Wood . That's right < PROPFEMALE > . Whattaya gonna do NOW ? 
Its time to cast your votes people . What should < PROPFIRST > do ? Should he go to the Student Bookstore to buy a binder for his Anthropology class for the extra dollar that they charge ? Or should he walk all the way out to his car and attempt to drive down Redwood Road to the nearest hot deal at the expense of gas ? Most likely I already know what I'm going to do , but what do YOU think ? 
thinks he's on to something new . Something big . And at the same time , who cares ? HA ! 
Reading < PROPFIRST > Goodkind again . Interesting line for women who catch unwanted men leering at them : \Remove your eyes from my flesh or have them removed . Your choice . \"" 
Ahhh days off . Definitely better than days on . 
love you long time . 
Ahh , my old friend < PROPFIRST > Cypher ( Rahl ) , its been a while ( a year , almost ) . What better way to end the day than to read about an old friend slaughtering a group of evil , bloodthirsty Mriswith with his own personalized sword of Epicness ? < PROPFIRST > Cypher FTW . < PROPFIRST > Goodkind's writing FTW . 
looked at his Facebook profile and pondered if he should write another Facebook story for his fans like < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > , but before he could come to a decision , a group of men dressed in leather jackets approached the front desk before brandishing what appeared to be AK-47s and HK-G3 rifles . With no time to think , < PROPFIRST > slipped beneath his desk and contacted an old friend . One of higher caliber , so to speak ... 
sported the Eggo Waffles for dinner tonight . And if you think that's wrong , well , YOU'RE wrong . 
Don't forget , guys :\

Man , college tact can be a biatch sometimes . I do one problem right on the board for Math and now people in my class are asking me to check their work for them when they do problems on the board . I understand the work except I don't wanna be labeled as a math geek with no life , yet if I try to play it off people get mad because they need a reliable source . Sup new test of life ? 
feels like he's stuck in that limbo state between dead and alert . In fact , that's the best way to describe it . Its like I've died and yet am still living in my own personal world where the living are simply moving around me like a river . Its part exciting to feel anonymous , but at the same time , you don't want the ones you care about to forget about you . 
When you think about it , the concept of Nirvana itself sounds VERY appealing , especially on a day like this . A state of higher yet simpler existence . One without care , worries , troubles , strife ; basically the lifestyle of < PROPFEMALE > The Pooh or Uncle Airo from Nickelodeon's Avatar ( the REAL Avatar ) .

Could someone please explain the logic in SLCC's idea to post jobs that require Bachelors ' Degrees for student employment ? Umm , if we had our Bachelors ' we most likely wouldn't be here at SLCC would we ? 
You know , its always a plus when you don't have to wear your coat to school . Not the WARMEST of weather , but it'll do . Thanks Mother Nature ! I owe you a cookie . 
< PROPMALE > Bowers was right . If it weren't for the temporary release known as video games , college would be too stressful . Thanks to the wonderful world of entertainment technology , < PROPFIRST > can release the tension and still get his homework done . Ahh Counter-Strike . Ahh Splinter Cell . Ahh StarCraft 2 . Ahh Assassin's Creed Series . Ahh Modern Warfare Series . 
\There are times when a fancy plate is favorable . \ 
Ahh the Boondock Saints . Such a classic show . 
knows what he wants for his birthday now ! And he's going to let you all know way ahead of time so there's no rush and no worry about whether or not I'll like it . This is guaranteed . So ! For his birthday , < PROPFIRST > wants an SR-71 Blackbird . No , not a model , the real thing ! Shouldn't be too hard . Just save up some money and give Lockheed a call . I'm sure they've got some spares . You guys are so awesome . Thanks .

Come on guys , really ? How long does it take to progress past the thinking capacity of a four-year-old ? Ladies , on behalf of me and somewhat for the rest of my gender , I'm sorry . Truly , I am . 
just got done with his first American Sign Language lab and it was EPIC !! And the best part about sign language is if you don't know the sign you can always improvise ( within reason ; don't make a < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > out of yourself ) or write it down on a piece of paper . Just remember to be polite . The awesome thing is deaf people think and act just like normal people . Especially with humor . 
Maybe I should change the rules and boundaries of folklore and write my own romantic series using a specimen that's normally associated with evil and deceit and change it into something passionately romantic and manly . Hmmm , let's see . YETIS ! That's what I'll do , I write a love story about a shy High School girl who falls in love with a YETI ! And his name will be all vintage-like . Lets see ... Poindexter . 
Have you ever had one of those realizations that just sets you free ? I just had one of those , and oh it feels great ! ( Breath and sigh of relief ) . 
K . 
is so glad he only has school and no work tomorrow . It will give him time to do his homework . 
Really ? CTR ? You're going to name your HVAC business CTR ? That's a cop out . That's like me opening my own internet cafe and naming it \Priesthood Session \"." 
has been watching Red Dwarf on Netflix . AHH the memories ! 
learned that when you throw clothes on and go to school unshaven with bed-head , it feels liberating in a very masculine sort of way until your sign language teacher decides to do a group activity and you get paired with all girls . I'll tell you what , all the charm in the world couldn't compensate for a guy who looks like a street bum . But I still enjoyed the care-freeness of it all , so ha ! 
has learned that Weezer makes for great music in the morning on your way to school , especially when you've got a Dungeon Master's guide , or a twelve-sided die , or < PROPFEMALE > Pryde and Nightcrawler too , waiting there for you , yes you do ...

SO ! Something awesome today , last night I was up until about 1:30 in the morning studying for my first Physics exam that took place at 8:30 this morning . I'm all nervous , I'm rolling it around over and over inside my head , I'm trying to remember this equation remember that , when all of a sudden the professor announces our exam is open book and open note . < PROPFIRST > ='< PROPMALE > :D :D :D :D !!! 
just had his first Capri Sun since sixth grade . And yes , I felt like a sixth grader again . Ahh . 
Holy snow last night ... 
never thought it was possible to play Rock Paper Scissors on Facebook , but , well , there you have it ! 
Music to my ears\ 
Your mouth moves\ 
It makes no sound\ 
Why is your mouth moving ? \ 
The music plays on\ 
And my eyebrows rise in delight as yours lower\ 
Anger on one side , happiness on the other . \ 
Angry mouth speaks violently on mute\ 
Yet mine sings , euphoric\ 
Threat from left side\ 
Your arm rises like bread\ 
But too late ! Wind swishes past my sideburn\ 
Dodging your punch . The music plays . You turn . Leave . I smile . 
A man's life story : \Excitement and food . \"" 
< PROPFIRST>'s Day makes for some romantic exchanges between couples at the register ... and some awkward ones as well . Example , a wife slid me a card and red envelope with her two fingers . She flirtatiously looked at her husband and said : \He's not allowed to see this yet . \ " The husband laughed and said : \ " Aww . You didn't have to do that . I didn't get you anything this year ... \"" 
I try to be as open and accepting as possible , but when a girl from work stalks you and hides behind the shelves watching you as you enter Subway and then sits down RIGHT in front of you the moment you sit down and doesn't even say Hi but just starts gabbing away about some distant relative's death and how her birthday was on Super Bowl Sunday , I can't help but be a little non-receptive . 
watched Pirates of the Caribbean tonight with his Dad . It was dope . Nothing a lil session of Pirates won't cure , especially with a parent you haven't seen in a month-and-a-half . I made fun of him , though ; he's got these pajamas that look just like < PROPFIRST>'s hat from Fantasia and they fit like a jump suit . The only thing missing were the \footies\ " and he'd look like a toddler . " 
wishes he had his own Tardis at times . Then I could take a vacation at any place or time in the universe . 
Have you ever had those goals where you realize that they're close enough to be obtainable but far enough that its going to take just a teensy bit more than what you are/have become right now ? Its exciting to think they're so close , and yet , the possibility of failure is always lingering . I figure the only way its going to happen is to dive head first and take a leap of faith . 
Oh man , no , why ? WHHHYYYYY ??? Sigh , < PROPFIRST > is having Lord of the Rings withdrawals . I now crave an epic adventure . Worse yet , my family stored my DVD's away and the only Extended Edition I've seen since January 2008 is Return of the < PROPMALE > . NOOOOO !!!! 
Iron Maiden sounds so geeky when you change the song lyrics to your everyday occurrences . \One !.... Minute !... to Maaaatthhh Classs ... \""

Nothing makes the weekend quite like a friend's birthday barbecue that includes gratuitous amounts of food , cake , ice cream and ice cold caffeine . And did that caffeine make < PROPFIRST > a fool out of himself that's going to feel a bit sluggish and other-worldly tomorrow ? You bet your arse it did . Heck , if I get a friendly text within the next three days I'll be SURPRISED ... 
Haha , is it bad to listen to Avenged Sevenfold on a Sunday afternoon ? Because I freaking love Avenged Sevenfold . The fact that their name derives from Cain's curse in the book of < PROPFEMALE > doesn't help the situation very much , at least from a Christian standpoint . But man , the song Afterlife in particular is striking a personal chord . That and Nightmare's an awesome song as well . ;) 
Well , I'm on my phone , looking at Facebook , just passing the time in my bed waiting for sleep to come because my brain apparently has this hidden hobby of dabbling in insomnia from time to time , and I guess the most thought-provoking phrase I can toss out there is :\

Mmm , yes . Muffins . Mmm .

has an awesome Grandpa . Tonight we pulled the tires off and replaced the brake pads on our own . Now , thanks to him , I'll never have to spend $150.00 just to get one of them fixed . Instead we ended up replacing two for the price of $44.00 ( the price of the parts ) . They were ceramics , too , so that should last a 2009 Hyundai Sonata for a while .

Oh great , < PROPMALE>'s testosterone is up again ... 
Ugh , not a big fan of the profile pic , but I figured I could be normal for a while . 
Oh dear Lord , please help me , I'm taking FACEBOOK QUIZZES !!! D: 
Watching Fellowship of the Ring on Netflix , and I just discovered something . Sauron was one of the biggest admin hackers of all time . 
Nostalgia , like the secret , hidden compartments of the mind , this hallway long time going without a visit now open to me . My mind , not a simple house as once thought but a large mansion , and many of these unvisited rooms now call to me once again . This door , the rare memories of toddler years , this door my fourth-grade year . So much of myself forgotten ... now remembered . 
is reading his assignment for Sign Language right now and thinks its ironic that the association to help adults who lose their hearing later in life is called the SHHH . ( Self-Help for the Hard of Hearing ) . 
Conclusion : Though we , as humans , share an innate instinct to conform and convalesce , it is abnormality that we idolize . Superman is not superman because he is normal . Mensa is not a society that is based on sameness . In fact , a simple resume is not a measure of sameness at all . It is the differences that make us who we are . The key to survival is to learn how to work together in spite of such . 
I just realized something now . You know , some of us have had to face more trials than others , however diverse . Its like a Poker deck ; others seem to be dealt a pair of aces while we have to struggle with a mixture whose highest card is a 7 . But while the illusion of fate may dictate that some are doomed , others destined , the key element actually has nothing to do with the cards . It is Attitude . 
thinks the debate over their draft pick from the Univeristy of Alabama ( Quarterback < PROPMALE > McElroy ) is sad but funny . The reason ? He's been deemed TOO smart for contact sports . Why ? He scored 48 out of 50 on their aptitude test for intelligence . What's the average ? 28 out of 50 . That's right , ladies and gentlemen , the average Quarterback in the NFL scores a 56% on the intelligence aptitude test . Sigh .

That's enough Math for tonight . Tomorrow equals finish Math and Physics by midnight and Sign Language assignment during midday . Then two exams on Thursday and I'm home free for a while . 
is having Inception withdrawals again . Must ... watch ... soon ... 
is taking a break at his Grandparents , and as is typical with the elderly custom around 7:00 , Grandpa's watching politics on Fox News . And I've officially decided that I am not a fan of < PROPFIRST > Hannity . He is SO one-sided and biased in favor of the Republican Party it almost makes me want to LEAVE what Republican values I have left . 
Doesn't want to end this logged day on a note about politics , so to all my gamer buddies out there , and the texting ones as well , I have but one thing to share with you :\ 
:D \ 
There you have it . Have a good night . 
It's my one of my all-time favorite weather scenarios outside and our Physics test just got postponed for a week !! Does it get any better than this ? I submit that it CANNOT ! 
is going to get a haircut today ; for those who have seen the movie , I'm starting to feel like < PROPMALE > Chigurh from No Country For Old Men . Maybe even when I go to Great Clips , I'll say : \Let me ask you something . What's the most ... you've ever lost ... in a coin toss ? \"" 
is grateful for the Bowers family . Not trying to sound too sentimental , and though they may never fully realize it , but < PROPFIRST > Bowers and < PROPMALE > Bowers are the type of friends who help you remember why life is a good thing . And they're the type who open their doors when the storm rages outside and all other doors are closed . Would that all mankind could have friends like them .

is looking outside and the only words that come to mind are a name and an abbreviation :\ 
St. George . \ 
I agree with < PROPMALE > Bowers , everybody talks about Park City , but boo Park City . Overpriced and overrated . If you wanna know where to have fun in Utah just visit the entire southern half of it .

Lord bless the man/woman who invented mops . Without them a bowl of spilled beets from the fridge would have equaled much anger .

Dude , you know whats a 1337 game althought it gets looked down on hardcore because of the few who really take it too far/seriously ? Dungeons and Dragons . Why spend thirty bucks plus fifteen bucks monthly to play World of Warcraft when all you need is some graph paper , die , and a decent imagination ? Not to mention it promotes social interaction and opens the door for tons of jokes . 
CURSE YOU , PHONE ALARM THAT I FORGOT TO TURN OFF FOR SPRING BREAK !!! 
You know what I love about our generation ? We're the generation who doesn't take things too seriously . For instance , I see Google employees who wear their pajamas and nightcaps to work and it's totally fine , I see guys in their twenties and thirties who dress in cardboard armor and goof off all day in public . In my mind , that's a lot better than a suit and tie everyday trying to act like you're 40 . 
is fine and dandy .

Okay , look , just because you're wearing an orange construction jacket doesn't mean you can literally rush out in the middle of fast-paced six-lane traffic just so you can cross the road . Come to think of it , though , if I remember correctly from High School , I do believe construction workers were worth twice the points plus instant access to < PROPFEMALE > Power . Geez , NOW I remember ... 
just tapped into his Smashmouth collection and forgot how epic the 90s were for modern music . Don't get me wrong , I love the hard rock from the 00s , but if there's one thing I miss from the 90s it was the fact that all you needed to make it to the mainstream was good music instead of being some fifteen-year-old that tries to talk like he's black or a be a fashion icon that repeats the same thing over and over again . 
And now a random excerpt from the book entitled \Ryan's Opinion\ " :\

Well the afternoon's turned out quite nicely . Hopefully the weather stays like this until summer hits . 
You know how in your sleep you'll sometimes shift positions ? Well apparently in my sleep I went from sleeping vertically to sleeping diagonally to the right ... which meant that when I went to grab this very cell phone I bashed my head into the headboard . FML

went in for a midnight snack and flipped on the garbage disposal instead of the light switch . This , in turn , scared my dog half-to-death , which then caused her to bark defensively at the top of her lungs which then awoke , shocked and enraged my Mom all at the same time which then had HER yelling at the top of her lungs which , yeah , wonderful way to end the evening ...

I'm totally down for counseling , even to the point where I've sometimes wondered if I should use it from time to time , but I believe those sessions need to be kept private . Reason ? Some lady's having a counseling session right behind me , to the point where they're talking about sexual problems with her military husband . Just a < PROPMALE > bit TMI , if you ask me ... :S

People in glass houses shouldn't throw rocks ... unless , of course , they're material scientists who know how to make a synthetic crystalline polymer with the transparency of glass . In that case they can throw all the rocks they want . But my question ; who the hell lives in a glass house to begin with ? Even more important ... who the hell moves NEXT to a guy with a glass house ? Isn't that ... disturbing ? 
I like using Facebook from my phone because it makes me feel like I have complete control over an organization right here in my pocket , like a Crime Lord or an Intelligence Management Officer ( a spy in charge of all other spies in a particular region ) .

Physics test CANCELLED ! Moved to 04/12/2011 . Win , and yet , dang it ... all that studying and hurrying to get to class just to find the door locked . I should really check my SLCC mail more often . If only there were an immediate Facebook or phone app for SLCC ... Hmmm ... $$$$$ .... 
Watching Tron Legacy . For the conventional drama enthusiast , it may obviously appear to have a mediocre plot with incredible visual effects and nothing more . But to the tech enthusiast/computer nerd/sci-fi fanatic , this movie is definitely the \Better Than Sex\ " cake of 2010 cinema . Only Inception scores higher in my book . "

So if you catch me being pleasantly fascinated by this new show called Extreme Couponing on TLC , you have no right to point the finger at me . ;) 
Today is an epic day , fellow Utahns . Today is the day in Utah's history where the most golfers will have destroyed something in their house , with or without clubs , simultaneously . 
? \I drive on the streets ' cuz She's my companion 
= ??? + .... = Zzzzz ... 
Not gonna lie . The < PROPFEMALE > weather down here combined with the snow in the mountains is very pleasing to the eye . 
Necessity is the mother of invention , and today was no exception . After being fed up with this friggin belt that's just one notch too lose , an idea finally popped into my head which involved my framing hammer , a 16-penny nail , and an unused wooden plank . Combined with a cold , cemented unfinished basement , I devised a cunning manner of making belt notches . Now I can wear these pants in confidence ! 
just downloaded the Disturbed discography ; I have to agree with < PROPMALE > . Ten Thousand Fists is my favorite out of the five . Not overly-rocked or dramatized to the point where its just depressing , but not wimpy or faint-hearted , either ; it has the perfect \edge\ " to it . " 
Alright , laundry . Prepare to die . 
Ahhh laundry , the only non-racist way to say you love clean whites . 
wonders how many men have proposed over Facebook ... and what the turn-down percentage is . 
just wants to thank all his friends who have been a good support for him throughout his life . Regardless of your standing , remember that you are important . Love you all . ;) 
still thinks our Government grows more corrupt as time progresses , but hey , Congress decided to declare its own random holiday this year ! What does that mean ? It means today I got my taxes done and they were still on time ! Lord bless Lazy , Self-Centered , Corporate-Governed < PROPFEMALE > . 2011 = The Year of Financial Luck . 
has a lot on his mind right now , particularly about his options . So many roads to take . The question is , which one best suits me ? And where will I have the most fun while learning what I want to learn before I die ? 
Watching X-Files on Netflix , making it the first time I've seen an entire episode of X-Files since 1998 ( 6th Grade ) . And you know what ? It's still that freaking awesome ! However , in my own personal report I would conclude the following ( updates pending ): \ 
1 . Never trust people in small towns . \ 
2 . If you join the Air Force , never become a Test Pilot . 
Overcast but without snow and a little drizzle from time to time . Some people hate it . I LOVE it ! It's my thinking weather ! :) 
Well , one final break before I make the final maneuver on Math tonight . All I gotta say is ... well ... nothing really . Ha ha , I know , you were probably expecting something random with two parts eccentric and a dash of esoteric , but hey , at least it's not like that stupid \Wear Sunscreen\ " speech that was given to the Class of ' 99 back in the day . \ " Wear Sunscreen\ " ? Really ? " 
Take that debts ! Eat Tax Return ! And I still have some left over ! :D Plus my State has yet to come in . w00t ! 
F.Y.I. everybody my phone is working again . So if your texts or calls went unanswered , fear not ! For all is well once more . 
Kind of ironic when you're playing Half Life Deathmatch and your name happens to be \Vash the Stampede\ " when you kill someone with a magnum ... " 
Facebooking from my phone at a friend's house at 2:00 in the morning . That's because if I Facebook via mobile , it means I'm a much more proactive person , right ? I mean , come on , why else would they use the term \mobile \"?" 
$57.49 just so my vehicle can run for a week and a half while some wealthy land/business owner takes it , pays maybe 3% of it to his workers and business expenses , puts the rest of it in his account and then wires it offshore so it can compound 33% monthly , then uses a geographic loophole to legally avoid taxes on it just so he can sit on his fat greedy ass ? I don't think so .... 
You know , an hour ago when I filled up my tank , my status update was very cynical . But after being outside just running a few errands , I can't help but comment on what a gorgeous day it is ! Its one of those days where it just feels so good to be alive , you know ? And for me , I'm glad I got sent to this Earth . ;) 
Rockin ' the adult life nostalgia . Being an adult definitely has its perks and I definitely hope there's more adventures in store . But for some reason today , I'm kinda missing my 7th-grade year . School and drama-wise , not really . But imagination-wise , my mind went wondrous places . I hope I never outgrow my imagination . It's too close of a friend to let go . 
? \Some would say tomorrow is just one step closer to death . \ 
The more I think about it , the more I really wanna do what Flynn , Jr. does on Tron Legacy in regards to his house . Take a really cheap abandoned place like a tune-up garage next to a river or on a hillside , get rid of all the junk , clean off the walls , and decorate the place until it looks like a home . Congrats . You just saved a ton of tax money plus you have this awesome Bachelor's pad with a view . 
\Get busy livin ' or get busy dyin'\ "" 
Ahh man , X-Files is so dope . I love Netflix . 
Has anybody else ever had a day where everything turned out great but you feel like something's slightly amiss ? That's how I've been feeling as of late . I even took a small nap to see if it was from lack of sleep but the feeling came back after about a half hour . Weird . Guess my subconscious likes to take a ride on the wild side from time to time . 
is cleaning his house today . Please , anybody , everybody , if I don't make it out alive , well ... please know that I died doing what I didn't like doing best . That's right , everyone , it was a sad , painful , miserable death , one from which many men disappear into the thick fog ... and only few return . Please tell my family that I loved them dearly and fought the good fight . 
Phase one down . Now processing phase two of house cleaning project . First step : Sit down on chair and take break for lil ' bit . No argument here . 
When I was in 7th Grade , I remember we got six inches of snow around May 3rd or 4th-ish . Maybe if I put a hundred down I can get lucky and < PROPMALE > this year ! 
Ahh , nothing like scraping ice off your windshield on May's doorstep . At least in Alaska they all get tax benefits just for being a resident . I think I hear my name coming far from the southwest . My best guess is it's either Vegas or San < PROPMALE > that beckons me . Hmm . In Vegas the casinos take care of state and sales tax . Yet San < PROPMALE > has the beach and that awesome < PROPFEMALE > that I've always wanted to go through . 
I think starting this Monday I'm going to get in an exercise routine that's a half-hour long before breakfast/shower/getting ready . I friggin did it every day in the mission field . Should be easy enough to start up again . Will someone please come shoot me if I don't ? No really , it would be much appreciated . 
About 50% , nay , 75% of you will hate me , but given the lateness of the year and the awkwardness of the weather , I cant help but be impressed to a certain degree 
Dude , what's more epic than a healthy sandwich at Subway but a Subway that's jammin ' with < PROPMALE > Marley ? Reggae and Chicken Orchard sandwich FTW . 
I have to give thanks to the people I < PROPMALE > out with tonight . You may never fully realize it , and frankly , it's probably better if you don't ( < PROPMALE > knows most of the story though , so props to him ) , but all I've gotta say is thanks . Thanks for all your wonderful laughs and the great blessing of your company and acceptance . I will never be able to fully repay , but hopefully I can someday do the same for someone else . 
made it to Church despite four hours of sleep and an apparent lack-of-dress-shoes situation ( I wore my black Nike knock-offs ) . 
Why can't more people in the world be like < PROPFIRST > Bauer ? 
Well Osama's dead , but I think this is just the beginning . True , the snake dies when the head is cut off . But don't forget that the body writhes and fights the hardest just as the head is cut off right before it dies . Not to mention , who's to say this was but one snake of many on Medusa's head ? 
Tomorrow I begin my exercise routine . Start out nice , consistent , and simple . After six days from Monday to Saturday , I'll have some plans and resources lined up to begin elaborating . And yes , yes , no need to thank me , I already knew that that was by far the most fascinating and thought-provoking status update you've ever read . After this I think I'll collect stamps and show off my Swingline stapler to future girls . 
Today's breakfast consisted of two eggs , three slices of bacon , two pieces of toast and .... Fiddy Cent . In Da Club makes for some rockin ' breakfast tunes , especially when you're cooking . 
After 5:00 PM today , my semester will be officially over . Hallelujia ! Bring on the Summer ! 
Loves it when you tell your friends and family specifically when you're taking your exam and they still call and text you asking where you are and why haven't you responded . 
The only update today is that there's no specific update other than this update , which is kind of a specific update . There , there's your update . ;) 
A Barnes and < PROPMALE > with cushy seats ! Hallelujia ! 
Nothing makes the soil more insignifigant and the garden tiller more voracious and omnipotent than when you're tilling the garden with Dragonforce and other noteworthy metal/power metal bands . 
just saw How To Train Your Dragon . That show rules . Ten times better and more original than Avatar . 
You know what I love about sending messages to your friends when they have a problem ? In giving them advice you find that you're giving yourself advice as well . That's not to say that I'm happy when my other friends are having a tough time with something . But sometimes I find it takes a third-person perspective to really assess what's going on in your life as well . One just hopes in the end both sides are edified . 
Happy Mother's Day to all you mothers . Men destroy the world . Mothers keep it together . Were it not for all you beautiful mothers out there the world would have destroyed itself a few millennia ago . Thanks for teaching us the values we need to help us remember how to stay civilized . Even more important , thanks for showing us love . 
Has anybody else heard of the Noetic Sciences ? If there's any shred of truth , no matter how partial , to the fundamentals behind Noetic science , then its fair to say that we as humans have barely skimmed the surface of our intellectual and spiritual capabilities . Children with life jackets in the Kiddie Pool , as it were . ;) 
Today's mood : Uggh
