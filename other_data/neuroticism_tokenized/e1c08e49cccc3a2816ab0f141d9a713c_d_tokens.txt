Has another miracle to add to the long long list . Keep the faith , people . Happy NEW YEAR ! Happy 2010 . 

Tomorrow is National Fatherhood Crisis Day !! 
Happy National Fatherhood Crisis Day , everyone ! Another event that's happening today is Fathers Day , by the way . :) 
Yeah . 
Tenshi wa Dare da ? 
Why ... did < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > have to die ?? 
Rest in peace , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . 
I hate how people didn't treat him well when he was alive -- that all they did was persecute him and ruin his life -- and now that he's gone people want to give him their respect and admiration . Too little too late . People don't even realize what he did , not 
I was unaware of the fact that Facebook has access not only to our account password but also the password to the email we use ! Has anyone else had their account shut down after being hacked ? Because FB administrators just told a friend of mine that her FB 
If I have been given no other gift , at least I have the ability to think for myself -- something not enough people can do these days . 
hhmmm ... 
says , \Let's move already ! \ " and hopes that Colorado is nice and hot . " 
Firefox spell check doesn't recognize the words eyeing , inconsistence , miniscule , inutile , trepidity , or mephitic .... 
' Ello everyone . :) 
So ... the solar eclipse isn't even going to be VISIBLE here ...? :'( People are making apocalyptic predictions about a solar eclipse I'm not even going to get to see ! 
just rediscovered how bad the new < PROPFEMALE > Wars movies are . 
doesn't really know how she's feeling today .... 
is caffeine sick today . ;P It's < PROPMALE>'s fault . 
is :) 
... Hellsing OVA < PROPFEMALE > was sooooo good .... 
... the ending for Wolf's Rain ... was really terrible .... ( I'm depressed now . ) 
Music . 
is discouraged by the fall of American standards ( in regards to everything ) . 
World , don't end on me yet ! I still have things to do with my life .... ( Like trying to SAVE you ! ) 
Yeah , last weeks in New Haaaaven . XD 
Don't say happy birthday to < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > tomorrow unless you would have said it BEFORE he died . 
doesn't want to leave home . 
: words can't express how much I don't want to go back . 
is back .... 
is obsessed with the idea of collecting BJDs ( Ball Joint Dolls ) now . I'm looking into when I can save up enough to order one in the likeness of Atsushi Sakurai .... 
is sitting in a room where all the things thrown all over the floor are trying to crawl up her feet and eat her alive . Why couldn't they have given us returning students more time to settle back in ? Unpacking is death . 
is paranoid about H1N1 now . I have some of the symptoms .... 
is tired . Homework is death . 
: Correction . Allergies are death . Shall I never know peace ? 
Was just in the water for two hours straight . It was very cold . :) 
watched Eragon on Saturday . It has to be one of the worst movies she's ever seen , lol . 
So is this H1N1 thing dying down yet ? 
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah ! I forgot Theater Proctoring yesterday !!!!!!!!!!! Sorry , < PROPMALE > !!!!!! 
is really considering going to bed at 8:38 . But homework ... 
I thought of you yesterday and it made me smile . 
is up at 7:00 on Sunday .... :) ... after Terminator last night . Wow , that's a good movie . 
How do I get in touch with the Red Bandits ? 
is drinking expired Diet Coke . :) 
woke up late ... and feels funny ... :P 
I really want to change my profile picture back to Atsushi , but I think Mom wouldn't like it , and I sort of like my current pic too . 
Living in the basement has led me to realize that it takes more than a few flights of stairs to separate you from others . 
Oh GREAT . 
There's an Atsushi Sakurai song ( that included Buck-Tick , Schwein , and his solo album ) for ever letter of the alphabet except Q . 
did nothing yesterday . 
Days like this have got to stop . I need to get my act together . 
I was listening to this Buck-Tick song and trying to figure out what \sutei goldo\ " meant . The song was called Stay Gold . I'm slow . :P I <3 Japanese . " 
Homework ! 
Oleic acid molecules , anyone ? :) 
My mailbox is CLEEEEEEEAN ! 
Samurai-M+K = ... Sakurai ! 
This week-end is probably going to College Apps and SAT studying .... Yuck . 
Really good Assembly . 
A good assembly can be really exhillarating . Would it be childish to say I want to change the world ? Being at Exeter sometimes reminds me of that . 
is looking for some good cello music for her film this spring . The Prelude for Bach's 5th Cello Suite is looking promising . Any other suggestions ? 
<3 Honesty Box 
can't believe it's almost the weekend again . 
had an interesting night . There was much haunting . Sssssssh , it's a secret . 
Let's see how long it takes to memorize Hamlet's monologue .... 
Good morning , seniors ! Ready fot the SATs ? 
Singin ' in the Rain is one of the best movies ever made . :) 
Math Test . Yuck . :P 
Too restless to focus . 
is loving this new school year . :) 
I feel a bad day coming on . But my days never end up being bad . I conveniently -- perhaps not so conveniently -- forget the negative parts . :P :) 
Three more classes till three days of freedom ! 
< PROPFIRST>'s coming over tomorrow ! <3 
I set my alarm for 11 with the intention of sleeping in ... but it's not going to happen . Good morning uppers and lowers ! Good luck on the PSATs ! 
How much does a crash dummy cost ? I wonder if I could make one .... I need it to fall off the Assembly Hall balcony in the spring . I need to film it , maybe . 
does not like judgemental people . 
wishes she could find someone to watch Gankutsuou with her . 
I wanted to post some poetic BS that < PROPMALE > Cristo Hakushaku said , but I can't remember any off hand .... 
That assembly ... XD Maybe I WILL go talk to that lady . She seemed pretty serious about herself . I want to see what she has to say about ... \writing . \ " Lol . " 
Chinese foot binding ... ew ... 
Perhaps I value my personal opinions so highly because they are not simply centered around the things I PERSONALLY LIKE . A good opinion is made in consideration of personal tastes , but also IN SPITE of them . Good opinions are made in a mind that is , at once , extremely open and carefully critical . 
I need to clean my room . There are leftover leaves from my herbarium project all over the floor . 
Plastic changes shape in the heat . 
The anime series Geneshaft ... If they're all genetically altered to be flawless humans , then why does Remmy wear glasses ? :P 
Aaaaw , Ponyo was so cute ! 
Dubs should only exist for the purpose of little kids ( who watch Pokemon ) who are too young to read subtitles . Otherwise they have no purpose other than making true anime fans mad . English dubs are going to give me hypertension ....

Oh please please take dis love letta-ah . I'm just a simple ... madness man . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Stevenson is looking at you .... 
Someday I will bring back TRADITIONAL animation and all this CGI crap will DIE !! 
is caffeine sick . Badly . 
Just blew my French presentation . :P Daaaaaaaaaarrrn . 
Cold Coke and chocolate is the perfect snack . 
The new week has come to eat me . It's Monday . 
I just had the weirdest dream . 
on some level really resents being a girl . Maybe I shouldn't , but it's the honest truth . By the way , the < PROPFEMALE > and the sky looked really amazing last night . I hope some of you got to see it . The < PROPFEMALE > was full , and the clouds were unusually visible ( almost white or light gray , even though the sky was dark blue ) . There were two orange-ish rings around the < PROPFEMALE > , and the clouds were going really fast . It was supernatural . 
Mujou da mujou da mujou da zekkai , ugomeku uzumaku arekuruu zekkai ... ( Sakurai Atsushi ) 
Good morning . 
Today is going to be a good day , I think . :) 
In general , does one usually see a version of themself in their mind's eye that is true to their real appearance ? Roughly , or almost exactly ? 
< sigh > 
Isn't ironic that Nightmare's best song ( one of its few good ones ) is called \Gackt\ " ? I hate Gackt .... " 
TGIF . 
Today : babysitting for the Richards family from 12-2pm . <3 Filming the dance concert from 7- 8:30 . 
<3 < PROPMALE > Henson and < PROPFIRST > Oz <3 
Apparently my father created and proved a theory contradicting Quantum Theory . He proved his own theory ... with valid mathmatical evidence and equations , and had it approved by the University of < PROPFEMALE > .... But he didn't have it publicized because then ... he would be successful , and he would have to actually PAY CHILD SUPPORT with his money . I can't stand my father . 
ano kumo sae koete yuku kirameku made kono yoru ni , doko made mada toberu darou tsukare hateta kono karada , shinu made habataite iku ( Sakurai Atsushi ) 
is listening to \My Baby Japanese\ " by Buck-Tick . " 
( to her Mum ): \It would be cool if Atsushi were my father . \ " .......... MOM : \ " As long as I have nothing to do with it . \ " XD " 
I hope Mr. Jabari is okay , but one-class Wednesday is going to be BEAUTIFUL !! 
Feel better , Mr. Jabari . 
I'm not going to watch The Christmas < PROPFIRST > with < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > as Scrooge , and neither will my future children . We , my future family and I , await the return of quality movies . :P 
Just gave blood for the first time !! 
You know he's alive when you make him angry . Let me tell you , there's no doubting it then . 
I got my clothes back from E&R and they weren't folded or cleaned .... 
Two of our Audio-Visual proctors are down with the Swine . :| 
is all ready for E/A . 
Somehow my fuzzy red socks ended up fuzed to my tights .... 
GO BIG RED !!! 
I was in the shower , and the pitch of the running water sounded like the cheering crowds today . I'm serious . It was really weird . It's like , when you've finished memorizing Hamlet's monologue , that's what you keep hearing over and over again . Now , after cheering for hours , all day , I keep hearing all the Exeter cheers . There was so much enthusiasm and adrenaline going around . You were great out there today , Big Red . 
Atsushi shaved !! It was apparently only a temporary thing . 
is hoping that modern American \filmmakers\ " ( if you can call them that ) don't completely destroy the role of movies in our culture before I get a < PROPMALE > to put my own movies out there . Just give my ten/fifteen years . I'll bring back the concept of GOOD MOVIES . " 
is starving . And sick . Not H1N1 , no fever , so I don't even get to go to the Health Center , really . 
Too much ! Too much work !!! and I just washed my earphones .... 
I'm running out of stupid things to say .... 
I believe in foresight . I always know who is going to be my Mortal ( in Angeling ) before I draw the name . I knew exactly who my mortal would be , and then I < PROPFIRST > her name . Then I put it back . :P The second one I < PROPFIRST > was also someone I had sort of guessed . This has happened every year I've been here . XD 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > LOVE LOVE 
Be kind to me , finals .... 
“A pessimist is one who feels bad when he feels good for fear he'll feel worse when he feels better . ” 
I'll let someone else take Atsushi's place as my profile representative , in honor of awesome French people . 
Christmas Treeeeeeeeeee ! Dauriauna and I just carried a 7-foot one back home from < PROPMALE > Soopers . That was fun . :) 
<3 our Christmas tree Laurent . Using ecology skills I estimate he's about 10 ( he's a big baby !! ) , and il est < PROPFEMALE > PLUS BEEEEEEAAU [ tree we've ever had] ! Yay for Christman spirit ! 
is tired .... Good night .... 
wishes she were tall , but is happy she is French . :P It's a cool thing to be . It's like Japan . The more I learn about it , the more I want to go there ( < PROPFEMALE > , that is ) . 
If all this stuff with financial aid doesn't clear up , we might not be returning to Exeter . Transportation now is VERY stressful ( with the changes in F . aid ) , and my mom's health is bad enough that she can't take trying to fill in gaps for F . aid when ends don't meet . When it comes to matter of my mom's health ( her LIFE ) , the choice is obvious . YES , it's that serious . So I guess we f . aid students just DON'T BELONG . 
Last day in Colorado ... Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ! 
is back ... here ... 
is too tired to go to class tomorrow . But we have no choice ... do we ...? 
was just looking up plane crashes ... because I got up at 5:00 to go for a walk but didn't want to because dorm doors aren't open at 5am anymore , and if something came to kill me I wouldn't be able to get into any of the buildings and would therefore probably die . So I looked up plane crashes instead ...?! That made my morning . 
feels better . 
THUNDER !!!!! Yeeeeeeeeaaaaah ! 
WHAT ?! #&%@&*@& !! Why is imeem a part of myspace music now ?!?!?!?! That's ridiculous !!! 
The Hudson crash landing was US Airways . No casualties , no injuries , though a few cases of hypothermia . In its entire 35-year career , Southwest has had only one fatal accident with only one casualty , and it's because the plane overran the runway ( due to weather conditions ) and hit two cars in the street beyond the airport . Once again , only one casualty . 
I always manage to find more stuff . :P ' Tis not easy . Takes skill . Mad skill . 
Watashi suis français . Watashi suis trés sugoii . :P :P 
Webmail is down ...? I say Hyde did it . Darn you , Hyde ; set my email free ! 
Recorded all these new songs ! Yay ! ... But I feel like a thief . :( Sorry , Monsieur Laurent , that I am a pirate . It's just ... what I DO . Désolé . 
He LOOKS like someone who does deep-sea diving . As long as I don't have to do it . 
< PROPMALE > should move to Colorado . :'( 
Caffeine detoxing right now ... uuuugh ... 
Kids , don't take drugs ... and don't eat a whole dark chocolate bar , about three packages of M&Ms , and half a bag of Hershey's kisses in the afternoon just because you don't want to go to class . You WILL feel it in the morning ( especially if you haven't had a lot of caffeine for weeks ) . As I said , now I am detoxing , or going into withdrawal ... or something .... Though I LOVE my Angel for all the < PROPFEMALE > !!! :P 
Uuuugh , send me food in Café World !! I'm all out ! 
You can yawn out of your nose .... It actually feels pretty good . 
is still not feeling well .... 
is sooooooooooooooooo happy her best friend got into Wesleyan !!! 
is closing her café ( in Café World ) until she has more food for her customers ... in 17 hours .... :P 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas , all ! :) and everything else . Happy Holidays ! 
Hellsing keeps getting more and more violent and gory .... ( Might've figured , having read the manga ; same deal with the violence ... ) Well , yay for Hellsing OVA VII anyway , I guess . Soon comes OVA VIII , where ALUCARD COMES BACK !!!!!!!!! It doesn't seem as violent when all the bad stuff is happening to Alucard . It's just kind of cool/scary then . Sorry to admit it , but it's true . 
As < PROPFEMALE > Ardoin says ( and my Mommy ! ) , only fools give up . 
Happy New Year . It's effing 2011 !! \ 
... \ 
Are you sure it's really 2011 ALREADY ...? \ 
Yeah , the calendar on my computer says so . \ 
The first 10th of the 21st century is OVER . 
hates the way all this stuff just goes on and on and on over and over again without ever ending . I just hate this . I hate what it does to the people I love . The rest just don't care . It just makes you sick to your stomach , and you can't do anything to make it go away . But you never stop loving your family and hoping ( and believing , and praying ) it will get better . You just keep praying it will get better . 
Please let tomorrow bring good news .... Tonight would be even better .... 
This can't be God's doing .... I won't believe it is . I'll keep praying , even though it feels like I'm going to go out of my mind .... 
If you pray , pray for my mom . 
Every day makes me a little more afraid of the future . 
hates people . I just do . If you're not a decent person , if you're selfish , stay away from me . I don't even want to look at you . I'm so sick of people . 
Just poured half my heart out into a bit of writing for my meditation .... :) Felt good . Haven't done something like that in a long time . 
Hello world . It's a strange day ... full of hope even will all the bitterness that comes with it . I'm feeling good about my meditation . I'm hoping that it'll be chosen to be read . Goodness ... the things I have to say ... As always , ? Atsushi Sakurai . ? my Mommy . ? my family ... even though probably none of you American idiots understand what love really is . At least I know . 
From nine pages down to TWO ( in my meditation ) .... Man ... back to the old drawing board . Blaaaaaaaaaaagg ... 
Recondite . 
I wonder if I just never spoke to my kids at all if they would develop telekinetic abilities .... 
I just retook the My Personality test , since < PROPMALE > Carvill and I were just talking about it . It's interesting .... My OPENNESS dropped 5% since last May . CONSCIENTIOUSNESS < PROPFEMALE > 1% . EXTRAVERSION went down 2% . AGREEABLENESS dropped 28% . NEUROTICISM < PROPFEMALE > 30% . That's the most I've ever changed since I first took this test last March . 
... tired ... 
Wow ... I lied . Season 1 ( of MacGyver ) is BY FAR the best .... Wow ... I was wondering where all the GOOD episodes were .... 
Every time I have a dream now ... MacGyver is in it .... I guess it's from watching 16 episodes in the last four or five days . I have issues , I know . Someone once told me that I was very obsessive and easily obsessed . Probably Tya < PROPFIRST > . Lol , shows how well a good roomie gets to know you . 
slept from 6:30 p.m. to 5:30 a.m. for some reason .... 
is checking out ??? - Libra ... music band ... probably suck , but ... might as well try . 
Wow ... Black turtle-neck under red flannel shirt with a brown leather jacket on top . I think only MacGyver could pull it off ... and I'm not even sure he did . 
J . K . Rowling is getting slammed with a plagiarism lawsuit ... See my link on my wall for more . If the allegations are true , all of you < PROPMALE > Potter people get a big \I told you so\ " from me . " 
Life sucks when you're a Power Point Perfectionist . 
is watching the Watchmen . What's UP with Rorschach's voice ?!?! 
Spring Breeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaak !!! 
got to level 23 in < PROPFIRST > Steel ! I've been trying to beat this game since the 8th grade and have never gotten past level 19 . :) Tough game ... crazy fun ... 
Every once in a while I'm sitting somewhere , having a nice time with my sister and brother , and all of a sudden I start to panic in my head . \I need to check Blackboard ! \ " \ " When's my next class ? \ " \ " Don't I have a paper due ?? \ " Then I remember ... it's okay ... I survived this term . It's over . " 
Society is getting to be tiresome .... Sadly , Café World is too .... 
I'm seeing the people I used to know changing into things I don't like , things I don't want to be with anymore . Where are the people with which I spent my life ? The fact that I understand them -- why they are what they are now -- just makes me realize that I can't abide by what they have become . I wonder , down the line , how many of them will be a part of my future and how many of them will just become wistful memories . 
Let's see ... Anyone else I can bug before I go to bed ...? 
It's a ghost or something .... 
< PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > is a fool . 
I have internet agaaaaaaaaaain !!!!! 
I love how in cinema ancient Greeks and Romans always have these prominent ENGLISH accents ! 
It's kind of nice to be sitting quietly and hear people listening to a < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > song . Then again , it's really sad that they never did before .... 
Hopes everything will turn out okay today ... 
Has nothing to do with college . Just hope everything is okay today .... I love you Mummy . 
Ha . Never tell me there is no God . Once again , this has nothing to do with college . I will just keep you hanging with my ambiguity . 
We'll see how life turns out .... 
misses Mum . 
This school is filled with too many effing know-it-alls . 
Now I'm going to learn Greek ... all because of Duity's stinkle Eurodigits . 
Allergies , caffeine overdose , and three hours of sleep do not end in a good day . 
Now ... self-quarantine ... 
I really don't want to live in this country anymore . 
Just had a liter of coffee .... Don't know why . Just felt like it , I guess . It was good . 
Lost : one orange plastic cover 5-subject notebook . If found , please PLEASE return ! 
Just because it's entertainment doesn't mean that its quality doesn't matter . You don't shut off your BRAIN when you turn on the TV . Music , the media , cinema : these are the things that reach everyone , regardless of education , income , or age . Once you stop caring about the kind of entertainment you approve you show your true colors as someone who doesn't care about social standards , and you are WORTHLESS . 
With every passing day I hate people more . Every day , that sickening disgust and loathing grows just a little more potent , a little more unbearable , and I wonder how long I can go on among so many selfish and ignorant fools before ... the repulsion just drives me mad . I keep going with the hope that I'll find somewhere/someone/something that shows me that people can change and that I'm not just talking to a brick wall . 
\We have now sunk to a depth at which restatement of the obvious is the first duty of intelligent men . \ " -- < PROPFIRST > Orwell " 
LOST !! : One orange five-subject notebook ( cover is plastic ) . If found , please contact me and return it . I need it desperately !! 
There is a reason why knowledge is limited . Science is not a god . It can only go as far as man drives it to go ; it is a tool of discovery , not omnipotence . It's easy for a man to know facts and stick to them -- that requires little intelligence . What takes real inginuity -- what REAL geniuses do -- is explore that which has not yet been comprehended by the human mind and change reality as we know it . 
The problem with epiphanies , and all great realizations , is that there's always another one around the corner . You'll never understand it all .... You just understand enough to make you realize how much you don't understand . Look at me , for example . Where has this year gone ...? Man , how I've changed . I know so much more , yet ... I'm still left in the dark . Takes true honesty and strength to admit that . 
has been arguing with the person on YouTube about vampires . You go ahead and tell me I don't know what I'm talking about and see what happens .... 
is downloading the 1958 version of Dracula to watch tomorrow ( the one with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > as Dracula ) . 
watched Labyrinth last night . How disappointing ... I thought it would have SOME redeeming qualities ... 
misses the evil thing , and IT can do nothing about it ! Now to call < PROPFEMALE > .... Poor bored evil thing . 
I know I should be doing my French . I know I should have done it before ... but I'm so sick of people , so sick of this place . I never thought Exeter would actually kill my love of learning . Then again , I never knew how detestable people are . Now that I know I hate them , life will never be the same , and maybe I'll always be filled with this bitterness and apathy . 
dropped her French binder on a mug of coffee and it didn't spill .... 
I was saying to myself ... I wish I smoked ... Atsushi smoked . Then I was like \Are you out of your MIND ?!?! \ " It's like when I start wishing I sounded like Nakata Jouji ( Alucard ) . " 
I ask for no pity . In fact , I pity you .... 
I stand by my statement that people are fools ... but it HAS been a good day . 
watched all of Mononoke in one day . Good anime ; I've been searching for a good one for a long time .... 
Tired . Not happy . At least the door is fixed . 
I need to find something to DO today .... 
:) TGIF . 
Hot , stuffy nights give me weird dreams . Kusuriuri-san meets the Conquerer Worm ... on a school bus . 
So you have more cutesy little male friends than I do . I can still pick any of you up and throw you in the river . 
Happy Mothers Day to my Mommy , Chanctetinyea J . J . Ouellette !!!!! 
is pretty darn excited for the end of the year . :) 
always wanted to go to Phillips Exeter Academy , even as a little kid . She STILL wants to go there , because this place ... is not Exeter . It's a mockery , completely contradictory of everything that was the real Exeter . I will be glad to leave this place and never bring my kids if it is going to stay this way and never improve . If that is the case , I would rather , like my Mother ( class of ' 87 ) , see this place fade away . 
is thinking about the future ... 
Fine . Delete my post and continue with your shallow fangirlism . It was only a faint hope that you might listen to me anyway ... At least I caused a mini uprising before I got kicked out . As far as I am concerned , the battle is won , and the enemy has surrendered to being stupid forever . Fine by me ... 
? < PROPMALE > Cristo Hakushaku ? 
actually sat on a push pin . I didn't know that actually happened in real life .... XD 
that wasn't so bad ... :) 
A&W Root Beer and burgers ... 
is waiting for something to come up ... 
It's so pretty in Colorado in the summer !! 
Yeah ! Out of the airport !!! 
is at the Renaissance Festival ! 
Mom won't watch MacGyver with me ... :'(

When was the last time I read and finished a good book ...? 
From experience : Headphones can go through the wash . Everyone , wash your headphones regularly ( warm water without bleach ) to prevent wax build-up !! 
is listening to \Is It Scary\ " by < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . The evil one is you . " 
\Alucard is amused . ( It's the only thing keeping you alive . ) \"" 
Want ... dragon ... 
Hellsing is now on blu-ray ... My gosh , how COULD you conform like that ?!? Breaking my heart ... 
How is it that I just wrote out an entire massive wall message to < PROPFEMALE > Melendez and accidently pushed cancel instead of SEND ...? 
How come Alucard never gets a hat head ? 
Boredom happens . Random happens . Often they work in tandem . 
One of the ladies living in this building said she heard a rabit dying last night . Turns out that's the noise a moutain lion female makes when it's looking for a mate . SO now we can't go outside at night , because there's a femal mountain lion prowling around in our yard . I now live in fear of being mauled by a mountain lion . <3 Colorado ...! 
It's one of those Goblin < PROPMALE > days . 
\Drifters\ " is actually getting interesting .... " 
was just perusing the end of the Hellsing manga and began to realize all she had missed the first few times reading it through . 
Cool teeth ... 
Why is there a dispute over when Vlad Dracul III was born ? Just because it was over 500 years ago is no excuse for people not to know the date ! :P I need to know these things for certain .... 
is desperately in need of a creative outlet . 
was sitting in the dark of her room when suddenly she heard , through the open window , the howling of a dozen or so wolves ... or coyotes ... or something .... 
To all of you who bash on me for my movie skepticism ( Valentín Hernández ! ) , I AM a fan of Avatar . 
The best way to go in life is to never decide what age you really are . When you get down to business , you can be ten years older . When it's play time ... you can be eight years younger . XD We are not meant to be limited by our ages . 
It's funny when you look on your wall and you're\ 
the main person posting stuff on it . XD 
I <3 the delightful YouTuber who commented ( on a video of DUBS Alucard laughing in slow motion ): \Sounds like a depressed beached ? whale thats slowly dying . xD \"" 
wants internet . 
Interneeeeeeett ! 
Ah , you beautiful piece of machinery .... 
Still here . 
needs to start DOING .... 
Back to Renaissance Fair ! 
Terrible weekend .... 
feels sick .... 
Leave my favorite characters alone !! Stop ruining them !! 
Yogi Bear 3D ??? WTF are modern movie makes DOING ? What are they SMOKING ?? 
Sometimes you're listening to music , and you don't even hear it . 
is so sick of saying how worthless people are . Does it really mean anything to say it again ...? 
I wonder if I try to upload The Lord of the Rings if Facebook would let me .... 
People imagine cruel , immoral villains who murder and deceive , who plot the destruction or domination of the earth -- individuals so detached from the world around them , so absorbed in self-centered ambition or hate that they aren't truly believable ... because the true villains of this world are the people who call you \FRIEND . \"" 
is tired . Kind of empty of thoughts . Lost my phone .... Would probably find it if I looked for it , but ... 
HATES people -- females especially , and I have no qualms about saying it !! 
There is something wrong with my Facebook .... It won't let me see any recently-posted comments on anything ! >:( 
started watching the Animatrix . Machines will never start any rebellion or uprising against humans . People will just become dependent on them and one fatal flaw will just cripple our society and wipe us all out .... 
If you haven't talked to me in a while ... say something . :) 
Fine . 
Darn computer ... 
wants to play Vindictus so badly ! 
What ?? How did I not understand that Open Beta for Vindictus will not be available in < PROPFEMALE > for at least another month ?!?! :'( I want to play now .... 
Is so desperate to read that she's turning to ebooks . ( Most of my stuff is still packed elsewhere , so i only have about six books with me ... not acceptable . ) 
So effing cold !! It's 37 * right now !! 
< PROPFIRST > Caine was born < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Micklewhite ?? \ 
And he's acted in every decade from 1960-2000 ?? \ 
Wow . 
Sometimes great and beautiful things are like that . At first , they seem like nothing . They're so simple , so straight forward . Then it dawns on you , suddenly , and you can't understand how you could have been so blind . 
is watching \Paprika . \"" 
is bracing herself to watch \Dracula 2000\ " because it just has to be done . " 
Okay , if people are going to make vampire movies that have nothing to do with Dracula other than the presence of Dracula and < PROPFIRST > Helsing , why even call it Dracula ? Just name the vampire < PROPMALE > and be done with it . But no . Lazy filmmakers like the novelty of having their characters pre-created for them instead of coming up with something original . 
Is it really 5:13 am ?? It's almost time to get up !! 
Someone ( who shall remain nameless ) ACTUALLY asked me who my profile picture was .... It's a sad world we live in . 
Dumb fruit fly died in my glass of water .... 
... siiiiiiiiiiiiigh ... 
is soon going to see her sister off at the airport . :'( 
is using Dauriauna's speakers . It's good to have my music again .... I feel like a new person .... 
Terrible day . 
Why do I keep getting headaches every day ?? 
is in trouble .... Wonder if anyone cares .... 
Whoa ! * Intense * mortification ! I started furiously bashing on this poem on LiveJournal , got into this BIG argument ... and then I realized it was a < PROPFEMALE > Plath poem . :P Shoot me now ! Lol ... 
SOMEONE TELL < PROPFEMALE > TO GET A FACEBOOK ! I MISS HER !! 
So ... I opened all the curtains , and for the first time my room was all nice and < PROPFEMALE > ! Then I was looking at Alucard ... and he was just glaring at me . So I was just sort of standing there trying to figure out what I did .... Then I remembered that he ( naturally ) * HATES * sunlight ( and it was shining right on him) ! So I HASTENED to rectify the situation , and now all the curtains are closed again .... The things I do ... 
Returning Langdellians ( like < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > , Roshumba T . Llewellyn , < PROPFEMALE > Takeshita , Sumun Khetpal , Yuna Evans , Olu Yussuff , etc . ) ... WELCOME BACK to PEA ! You should friend suggest the some of new Langdellians to me as soon as you can ! It would be fun to get to know them . :) 
steals the few good pictures there are from the ! Alucard ! fan < PROPFEMALE > for my collection ... then is like , \All those fan-girls are effing scary 
... siiiiiiiiiiigh ... 
Trans sarake dase yokubou o suiagete yaru\

It's shaping up to be another rotten day .... 
Meh ... guess it wasn't that bad ....

This is Hell . 
Now when Ondrelique almost calls Alucard Atsushi by accident , you know she has a very very obsessed , conflicted , and confused mind that is much in need of medical evaluation . 
It's all right . You live your life , and I'll live mine ... because once all of this is over and done ... I won't want to talk to you anymore anyway . 
There are no words to say other than I hope that Chanctetinyea J . J . Ouellette can be at peace now that she does not have to suffer anymore . I love you Mommy , and I miss you . Rest In Peace .... 
just turned down a ride on < PROPFIRST>'s motorcycle and is now regretting it . :( I wonder what Mom would have said on the matter if she were here .... 
It has now been a week and 24 hours since Mom passed away .... 
doesn't feel like getting out of bed today . 
Rotten/tough/lonely day .... Just making sure I don't have any company coming over ... then I will be very relieved to go to bed .... 
Today was better than yesterday , but in the end it felt the same .... 
Finally , to bed .... 
I wonder if I should just copy and re-post my status from two night ago .... Feels just about the same .... 
Discovered a typo in my last status , so I couldn't really leave it up .... 
There's nothing I really feel like saying anymore , but I don't believe in keeping silent . 
This is why I DO NOT like depending on other people ! I have an appointment to keep ; if you're going to do me a favor by giving me a ride , you need to be considerate of MY schedule , or don't do the favor in the first place . This is NOT the time to be talking on the phone and taking me where I need to go whenever you feel like getting to it .... It's kind of important .... 
You know , < PROPFIRST > Canal Tinius , I just realized that today IS a beautiful , beautiful day , and I think that there will be many more beautiful days to come . 
didn't know I was watching the uncut version of \Ichi the Killer\ " until after I finished it .... :P That was an experience .... " 
Every day gets a little bit lonelier .... 
<3 visits from < PROPFIRST > . They make happiness possible . :) He's a great person . 
has a list of movies that I have been told ( by < PROPFIRST > ) that I should watch . Starting with \Dawn of the Dead\ " ... :D Let's see how many of these movies I can get through tonight !! " 
Why can't packing do itself ?!?!?! 
is Happy ! :) Watch out planes , here I come ! 
Dear Broke College Student , \ 
Apparently society thinks that we are responsible for all its problems , but \the cat will mew and dog will have his day . \ " In other words 
I am a Revolutionary Iconoclast , not a Troll :) 
is about to watch \Kiss of the Dragon\ " :P " 
is watching \An American Werewolf in London \"." 
watched \The Thing\ " and is now watching \ " Robo Cop\ " XD I am slowly working my way down this list . " 
It's looking like Buck-Tick's new album is going to be really good ! 
slept all day and is missing Colorado . :P New England is yucky . 
has gotten back into the old bad habit of staying up too late at night ... and getting up too late in the morning as well .... 
Computer won't backup on it's own , so I have to move all the files by hand onto the portable hard drive ( over 200 GB of stuff ) .... Then tomorrow I reinstall Vista and start over from scratch . Guess it just had to be done sooner or later .... 
Nooooooooo !! \ 
< PROPFIRST > Isaacs WITHOUT his natural , awesome Brittish voice ?? ( I glanced at the movie \Friends with Money\ " 
is gearing up to do another pen/hand tattoo ... maybe tomorrow .... 
Hmmm ... should I or should I NOT succumb to watching a potentially stupid , boring , stereotypical , cliched , predictable , terrorist- and WMD-containing American war movie ( Green Zone ) just because < PROPFIRST > Isaacs is in it ...? 
is trying to keep up with everything/everybody , and it's hard ! Oh well , today I am making cookies . LOADS of COOKIES ! Muahaha ... 
just finished baking . :) To bed soon ! 
First day of playing Vindictus today . So much fun !! So cool ...! 
wants to play sax again . 
It's taking Vindictus as long to install weekly patches and updates as it took for the game client to download in the first place .... :P 
It's LOVE MY SISTER week . If you have a sister who has made you laugh , wipedyour tears , hugged you , watched you succeed , saw you stumble , cheered you on , and kept you strong , post this . Sisters are a friend forever . Put this on your status if you have an amazing sister . 
Just looked up the lyrics for an Adiemus song . Are these even real words : \ < PROPFEMALE > fa te < PROPFEMALE > ti < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > fa te < PROPFEMALE > ti < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > fa te < PROPFEMALE > ti < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > fa te < PROPFEMALE > ti < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > va\ " ? \ 
Please copy and paste this to your status if you know someone , or have been affected by someone , who needs a punch in the face . People who need a punch in the face affect the lives of many . There is still no known cure for someone who deserves a punch in the face ... except a punch in the face . But we can raise awareness .... 93% of people wont repost this . They need a punch in the face ! 
No sleep . Oh well . Who cares ... 
Going to bed after 5am is becoming a bad habit .... 
Good morning world . Haven't slept yet .... 
Went to bed at 9am for the second time . Woke up at 12:47 . Should be tired , but I'm not .... Reminds me disgustingly of Exeter .... 
Why can I never attract a GUY to my LiveJournal ?? I know that sounds strange . Also I know it's wrong that I tend to value guys ' opinions more than females , annoyed with females as I perpetually am -- makes me seem like a misogynist when I'm really not . But seriously , the only people who ever show interest in my opinions are females . Where is that inspirational conversation with that random person of the opposite sex ?? 
INSPIRATION , I have FOUND YOU !!! Look out world ! \ 
This is it . 
Gosh darn , it's light outside already ?! 
Anyone speak Italian ? \ 
Isn't \babbo mio\ " or \ " mio babbo\ " a really old form of saying \ " father of mine\ " where \ " father\ " is usually \ " papà \"?" 
So many words Firefox doesn't recognize in its dictionary , like verisimilar , abberance , xanthous , and jeopardous .... :( 
met this person online . We hit it off so well that I am now watching \One Piece\ " because that person likes it so much . FOR FRIENDSHIP ! IN PURSUIT OF FRIENDSHIP ! \ 
... sigh ... ( not a particularly bad sigh , but ... ) 
\I come in a world of iron ... to make a world of gold . " 
GO . TO . BED . 
Oh , it's Thursday ? I'm beginning to forget that separate days exist .... 
has to take a nap . NOW . 
is depressed in that way that leaves you scared . 
Onegai ga arunda sayonara no kisetsu\ 
Kami-sama yume wo 
is hoping everyone has a happy Thanksgiving , and that they are able to spend it with the people they love . I'm also hoping , as I always hope , that in these holiday times more people can understand what love is .... 
is cooking . :3 
Male lactation ? Men can breastfeed ?!?! Incredible ! 
Ask a friend or family member ( or anyone around you ) to describe an abstract word or concept like romantic , awe , distasteful , anguish , hate , dire , loyal ... in their most fundamental sense . It's interesting to see how people respond . 
If LiveJournal kicks off ONE more thing I've spent all day writing ... I think I'm going to throw my computer and just give up on writing in general . Gosh ... 
< PROPFEMALE > Mercer from Smallville is Crispin < PROPMALE>'s sister ...? :P 
Stop wasting time on pointless Hellsing blu-ray and get Hellsing OVA VIII out already ! 
Who needs vampires anyway ? 
Bored . Taking too many quizzes ... 
What ?? The male lead of \The Pirate\ " ( with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > ) was < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > ?!?!? I saw that movie so long ago ... I didn't realize . <3 < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > . Have to watch that again . Good movie . " 
Worst nightmare in a long time ... 
Christmas < PROPFEMALE > :3 
It's an hour early , but I'm off to bed soon , so I will say it now . < PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone . I hope you are all happy and with the people you love . May tomorrow be a wonderful day for you all . :) \ 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas , Mama . I love you . 
Thanks for all the birthday wishes ! <3 I had a great birthday . :D 
Snow ! So much snow ! 8D Keep snowwwwiiiiiiiiing !! 
So ... it's the last day of the year already .... 
Mad . Troubled . Going to bed . It's getting light outside .... 
Just so you know , Dauriauna M . Ouellette doesn't like cute baby polar bears .... 
Much to be done this morning ... 
Do not change you Facebook language to something you don't know how to read . You will have a heck of a time trying to change it back . 
This new profile makes my head/eyes hurt .... 
No ! Too much snow ! Not today ; it's my day off and I need to run errands !! STOOOOOPPP ! 
I was organizing new additions to my music library .... I started last night and stopped after about two hours . Again , I am giving up . There are way too many songs ( maybe about 200 ...? ) to sort/rename , and I'm a perfectionist when it comes to organizing .... 6448 songs is the current census for my library . :D I'm proud of that . 
You , awesome man . Hair . DO NOT CUT IT !!! NO . It was so pretty before .... 
* Finds new Atsushi Sakurai pictures . * Immediately runs a hard drive back-up . \Nothing is going to hurt my Atsushi pictures . \"" 
I want a pet tarantula . 
I just realized that the people of < PROPFEMALE > are called Venetians .... So THAT'S why they wear Venetian masks/outfits at the Carnival of < PROPFEMALE > ! 
I HATE Macs .... 
Should go to bed . Work at 12pm . :P I don't feel like sleeping yet .... And I'm thirsty . 
Just realized what \pinky mice\ " are ( when talking about pinky mice as reptile/tarantula food ) . D ' : " 
I want a tarantula so badly !! 
May < PROPFEMALE > tooday I will rite evreething fonetickly .... That mite < PROPFEMALE > fun .... 
Dauriauna M . Ouellette -- Hi , the number for Brubbie's room ( now that I got us a phone ) is 603-646-7168 . :) 
Bed time . Hopefully up early tomorrow for a nice walk ... 
I can never eat Wheat Thins without eating the whole box .... 
Me : \This guy with the < PROPFEMALE > in his mouth is funny . \ " \ 
Just got back from seeing < PROPMALE > Potter 7 . Not bad , bot bad . At least it was better than the 6th one ! 
Half of my left index fingertip has been numb for several hours . O.o 
It's a nice day when you have Miso Soup for breakfast . It's a bad day when you spill it in your bed .... 
Good . Managed to purge 25 gigs of stuff from my hard drive . :3 I was getting a little scared there .... 
I need breakfast . But I'm not going out while it's -8 * so ... 
Laughing at myself . 
Crocodile saved Luffy AGAIN . :3 <3 Crocodile . 
Finally watching \Baccano\ " as per Valentín Hernández's recommendation . I actually like it so far ; it's really interesting ! Thanks Valentín ! " 
Postcards are expensive . >:( 
Don't worry , I am alive and well . :) 
Gah ! Crappy internet , I was doing things .... 
Headache . :P 
Finished Wolf's Rain with Torrese Arquee Ouellette . Finished the third \Skulduggery Pleasant\ " book ( SUPER easy read ) . Slept one hour and seventeen minutes ( roughly ) . Maybe trying to go back to sleep is a good idea . " 
< PROPFIRST > Hill , < PROPFEMALE > Hill : Congratulations on the baby ! I'm kinda upset because internet here is sucky and I have been offline for a reeeeeaaaallly long time . But I wanted to let you know how happy I am that you guys are parents !! <3 <3 <3 Lots of love for you and the baby ! 
A world with no homeless pets ? I think a world with no homeless PEOPLE comes first . 
How ? How did ALL my Mozart just disappear off my computer ?!?!?! 
So I just found out about Nyan Cat , and I'm taking it on ! I know that someone did seven hours ( 25200 sec ) . That should be easy to top . 
WHY IS THE NYAN CAT A PIECE OF TOAST ?!?!?! 
Videos for the \Go on the Razzle Dazzle\ " live are finally on YouTube . :D My heart sings . " 
First mosquito bite of the year . Of course the thing bit me through my jeans . :P \ 
The battle begins .... 
Anthropophagi - a cannibal faerie . He has no head , but his eyes sit atop his shoulders and a mouth may be found in his torso . His lack of a nose allows him to eat human flesh without gagging . \ 
\ 
COOL ! 
Cururipur - A powerful South American spirit who owned the jungle and tortures tortoise hunters since the tortoises are his friends . \ 
Lol . 
Sucky internet . First thing I'm getting when I have some spare $$$ is a good router . :P So annoying . 
Just realized I've only had some Wheat Thins , a gram cracker , and a sandwich with fries in the last two days .... :P Maybe that's why I'm so out-of-it .... 
Lol ... hello all . I'm on Facebook , miraculously , for the first time in probably a week or so . :3 Remind me what Facebook for again ...? \ 
Bye . See you all in another week or so . xDDDD 
Meh , nevermind . I guess I'll stick around for a while .... 
Saw a random picture of Atsushi from Dress pop up on the right side of my screen -- the part where he looks like a girl but CERTAIN PEOPLE IN MY FAMILY insist that it's not really him . :P Dauriauna M . Ouellette , is this your picture , and where is it , and is there a debate under it , cause I wanna join . It IS him , you know .... 
Bah ... my mind isn't working very efficiently today .... 
Sleepy ... 
Playing Vindictus on a computer in the library . xD 
So tired . Too much to do . I wish idiots would just leave me alone . 
We're actually on lock-down . Tornado watch . Sort of kind of scary . 
Okay , they're telling everyone who hasn't eaten yet to ORDER food , since we're on lock-down for the tornado watch . So ... what about the people who have to DELIVER the food TO US in these possible tornado conditions ?? Very \non-sibi\ " of us .... " 
Looking like a pretty good day . :3 
MUST < PROPFEMALE > out before graduation !! ( Valentín Hernández , < PROPFEMALE > Ogundayo , < PROPFIRST > T . Wen-Wampler , < PROPFEMALE > Rendleman ) 
It's easy to judge someone's situation when you're not the one in it . 
Be back soon . No < PROPFEMALE > for Facebook at the moment . 
POKES to everyone . Lots of love , but I've gotta go . :3 Busy . 
Um ... where did my brother go ...? 
Semi-constant state on LiveJournal : Please , please , PLEASE someone notice that the things I say actually make sense ! Please ... notice that the things I say are actually important .... \ 
< dramatically bursts into tears , then bites keyboard like hungry raptor > 
Three minutes to freedom . \ 
And my mind is on that person I critiqued for being a blind patriot . \ 
Think I hurt the person's feelings .... =P 
Lol , I'm here at work until 9:15 and Gaynerd is a real surname . 
\Haters gonna hate . Gators gonna gate . Taters gonna tate . Waiters gonna wait . Painters gonna paint . \ " \ 
Spam comment in my LiveJournal reads :\ 
buy cheap facebook fans\ 
buy facebook fans cheap\ 
buy facebook likes 
LiveJournal is running slowly again . Here comes another practice in the < PROPMALE > called * < PROPFEMALE > * .... 
So , looks like LiveJournal is back up for the time being .... :D 
Started reading \Autopsy - A Screenwriter's Guide\ " online . Not a pleasant thing to do . I think I'll quit .... " 
So ... what's up with you ? Hm ? 
Frustration . 
Apparently E Nomine's version of a single is a CD with 10 different remixes of one song , i.e. \Deine Welt\ " single is just a dozen different mixes of \ " Deine Welt\ " . :S WELL now ... " 
Booooooooooooored and sleepy . :( Wanna go home . 
Hmmm ... for some reason right now < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is the only thing I can read .... Can't focus enough for the classics or even for Stoker . Kinda frustrating .... \ 
Off to LiveJournal now , I suppose . I'm in the mood to write something violent . >:3 
On the subject of Phineas Gage :\ 
\ Mr. G . got up and vomited ; the effort of vomiting pressed out about half a teacupful of the brain 
So tiiiiiirrrrrrreeeedddddd . Want to go home . 42 more minutes .... 
Good news : promotion !! Bad news : more work . :'( / :D 
I love working here some times ! Two hours ago I asked a Hop Admin via email if she could tell me what < PROPFIRST > Metheny music was playing in the hallway so I could buy it . An hour later she stops by and just GIVES me a copy of the CD . So much YAY !! 
HOW DARE DUBS EXIST ?! 
Off to bed ... 
LOST POWER FOR ABOUT FOUR MINUTES ! 
Too many people complaining about LJ all the time .... :P 
The network is really slow after < PROPFEMALE > . I guess if that's all that I have to deal with in regards to a hurricane , though , I should be pretty happy . Just bored . Want to go outside in the sunshine .... 
Internet here at work is worse than at home . :P 
People are disgusting . 
Meh ... just bashed on the people on the LiveJournal Facebook < PROPFEMALE > for complaining so much . Suddenly not much of anyone else is posting . Wondering if it was a good thing or a bad thing to do . It might make people uncomfortable , but honestly SOMEONE had to say it ! 
I think about the times when people ( especially my peers ) were friendly/nice to me out of the blue , and suddenly I am wondering bitterly for the first time how many of them were really nice people and how many of them just felt sorry for me .... Disgusting . 
GOING HOME ! BYE-BYE DUMB WORK ! 
Sporadic pain in my ear . :P Pain in my head ( tension , I guess ) . Aggravating . Just try to relax and ignore it .... 
My water bottle opened in my purse .... Now I'm trying to dry out my whole notebook , which contained all my letters from < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE > , letters in the making that I have yet to send and more than a few drawings , among other things . :((((( 
You can't call yourself an anime-lover if you watch the dubbed versions . 
Two minutes to freedom .... 
TGIF ! Going home ! 
Happy Birthday , Mama . \ 
( Chanctetinyea J . J . Ouellette ) 
45 more minutes and then at least I can go home and be morose in the presence of my lovely siblings . :) 
I want to play saxophone again so badly . :( 
Failed ! I failed ! I just hope my bosses never notice .... :P 
What is a false nixie ? \ 
Aha ! http://www.dydacomp.com/helpdesklogin/kbdocs/Lorton_500.pdf 
Hey ... my blood pressure is down :D ... plus I lost 28 pounds in the past month ? O.o 
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL DAY IT IS OUTSIDE ! I'M HAPPY TO BE ALIVE !!!! 
@Torrese , if you have a moment , I'm hungry . :( 
Noooo . Night at the Hop at 7:30 pm , and the T-shirt my bosses ordered for me is too small !!! D ' : What to do ?!?! ( And how to gently bring it up ?!?! ) 
Three hours of work left .... 
Oh , < PROPFIRST > Bocelli is blind . :P I'm slow . 
From LiveJournal :\ 
LongJohn : What is a pirates favorite letter of the alphabet ? \ 
HandsomeJack : RRRRR matey . \ 
LongJohn : No , ya landlubber . The C is his first love . 
\Halo\ " by Depeche Mode has been stuck in my head for the past hour and a half .... " 
I think I'm off at 2:00 today ! Happy day !!!!! 
Dauriauna , I just recognized the site master of Buck-Tick Zone as a really , really annoying lady I've seen other place . :'( Oh , the disappointment .... 
For months now I've thought that I would have to shell out hundreds of dollars to get my MacBook fixed . I brought it in today , and all it needed was the power settings just needed to be manually reset . :P Cost : $0.00 . 
Such an idiot ... 
The speakers here in the Hop are much better than mine .... :( 
Off at 7:30 today . :) ( cc : Dauriauna , Torrese ) 
< PROPFEMALE > , can I ask you a favor ? I'm sure you're probably busy with Exeter work , BUT if it's at all possible , can you Pu-weeeeez take a look at my contest story ? Lol , I changed a LOT of stuff in the last 24 hours ( like the whole story ) , and I need to get it in the mail by Wednesday !! >:} So I'm in a big rush . It's not ready to be looked at yet , but it probably will be tomorrow , and then I need a crash-fast opinion/edit . Let me know if you're up for the task , and don't be too shy to tell me if you don't have time !! <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 
Torrese , I'm off at 7:30 today ! :) 
Can't write anymore . Broken sleep last night . Too much work during the day . I have to take a break if I want to still be sane once this project is finished .... 
If I finish this on time it will be the greatest writing achievement of my life so far .... 
The world is against me . My < PROPMALE > keeps dying . The < PROPMALE > I borrowed here at the library ... doesn't have Microsoft Word . Open Office opens my document as read-only .... Didn't bring any $$$$ with me when I left for work this morning , so today my diet consists of a single Hostess < PROPFEMALE > pie ($2 I happened to have in my pocket ) . Road-trip food . Need to finish this project , but the world's against me ....
