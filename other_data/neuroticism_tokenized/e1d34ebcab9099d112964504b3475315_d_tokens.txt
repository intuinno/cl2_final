Every one should keep a mental wastepaper basket and the older they grow the more things they will consign to it - torn up to irrecoverable tatters . 
Hot and Steamy 
When one door of happiness closes , another opens , but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one that has been opened for us . 
Never miss a < PROPMALE > to keep your mouth shut .

People need to understand that children with special needs don't have an illness , so there is no cure & it's not contagious . They only want what we all want , to be accepted . Most of you probably won't copy and paste this . Will you do it and leave it on your status for at least an hour ? It's Special Education week , and ...... this is in honor of all the kids who need a little extra help & understanding . 
how awkward is it when the doorbell rings and it's your brother's teacher ...

If somebody tells you nothing is impossible . ask them to dribble a football

Why do we call something sent by car a shipment and something sent by ship a cargo 
I love children , especially when they cry , for then someone takes them away

If you're an ant , and you're walking along across the top of a cup of pudding , you probably have no idea that the only thing between you and disaster is the strength of that pudding skin

in champaign it is a law that \one may not pee in his neighbors mouth\ " people wonder why illinois is nuts ... " 
Post this as your status if you know someone who suffers from being a Packers fan . Being a Packers fan is a real disorder and should be taken seriously . There is no known cure for PF and sympathy does not help ... but we can raise awareness . 100% of Bears fans will repost this ...... simply because we know how to copy and paste . 
Mr. Gros- \I hate color ! \ " Me- \ " yeah cause your very colorfully striped shirt definitely helps you with that\ " ah good old band ... "

how life works : we suffer through our lives and then we die . such a positive person arent i ?

clap count for the state of the union address = 63 . anyone else think thats insane ?

only < PROPFEMALE > Stoneberg would stalk someone from < PROPFEMALE > and then proceed to TRANSLATE their wall posts . my friends are creeps and that is indeed why they are my favorites 
only my father would grill when it's pouring ... 
I kinda just rode on a hovercraft with < PROPFEMALE > scala :)
