-- Those who get too big for their britches will be exposed in the end . 
Mahatma Gandhi , as you know , walked barefoot most of the time , which produced an impressive set of calluses on his feet .

I have never publicly spoken against the LDS church or its leaders , but what < PROPMALE > K . Packer stated yesterday pisses me off BIG time !

Why does he allow innocent people to suffer at the hands of others ? Oh , I could go on ...

When you dream in color , it's a pigment of your imagination . 
Some days we're at the top of the world . Some days we're not . When we're feeling low , it helps buoy us up by hearing how we have touched the lives of others . I'd love for you to send me a message or wall posting of what positive impact I have had on you . Then , copy and paste this to your wall and see what impact you have had on others . Have fun and enjoy !

A woman came home to find her husband in the kitchen , shaking frantically with what looked like a wire running from his waist towards the electric kettle . Intending to jolt him away from the deadly current she whacked him with a handy plank of wood by the back door , breaking his arm in two places . Until that moment he had been happily listening to his iPod .
