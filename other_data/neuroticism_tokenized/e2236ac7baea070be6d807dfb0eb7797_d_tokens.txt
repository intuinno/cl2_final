I think the fly in my room was just as tired as I am this morning .... I actually managed to finally kill it(by hitting it with my hand lol ) . o.o 

Ugh , If only I had a job .... If only I could get a job . o.o Damned school . Been having flashbacks to Las Vegas and San < PROPFIRST > all this morning ... I wanna go back out there again , If only I had the money . * sniffle * ._. 
Blahfleble . D| Currently watching all episodes of 1000 ways to die , and now I know I should never eat before I do . * barf * But to be honest , some of these things are very informative ... I'll keep what I learn from it for future reference , haha . 
I will never hate motercycles more then I do now . Honestly , I CAN'T FREAKING STAND ALL THE GOD DAMN NOISE ! \ 
\ 
And to add on to that , I killed a fly with a bouncyball today and now there's fly guts on my window . o.o 
One more day until Jadzias Party ~ * squee * 
Today's new episode of Naruto Shippuden was kinda sad , yet very awesome . R.I.P Kakashi , as finally an important good guy was killed . Wonder who's next in line to die . Keep it up , Pein , I'll be cheering for you . <3 \ 
Can't wait for next Thursday's new episode , but even more to the point I plan to sleep in very long tonight . Hopefully I'll wake up at around 12pm , so I'll have less waiting time for Jadzia's party . 
Hmm , I'm feeling a really weird now . I've been looking at what it means when your Index or Ring Fingers are longer then each other . \ 
Males are suppost to have longer ring fingers then index fingers ... And females are suppost to longer index fingers then ring fingers .... And my ring fingers are 30mm long , and my index fingers are 27mm ... Making my ring fingers are longer . \ 
Hmm .... I wonder what this could mean ? 
I never would've thought that ever since I started drinking pomegranite juice , my bathroom inventory would slowly turn into everything being pomegranite scented as well . 
I definently learn a new thing everyday if not more . o.o \ 
\Homosexuality is not unique to humans . Many species have been observed engaging in homosexual activity 
Oh geeze ... I think I'm unintentionally trying to turn nocturnal . D: Yesterday I woke up at 1:45 pm ... Today I wake up at 12:04 pm .... And I keep staying up till 12:00 am or 2:00 am . 
At Nine-O ' Clock I'm officially out of the hell hall called my school . o.o HURRAY !

Been destroyed last week , hiking , going to the river twice , wild island , Lake Tahoe , spending practically no time at my house alone until today ... And today I'm gonna go break my ass biking for a few hours . I'm going to be a walking corpse once summer is over . 
Playing with my hair = fun . :3 Wonder if I can make anything up that'll look good on me .

I have never seen a black widow in real life until now , and I can't bring myself to kill it . ._. It's currently living in the corner of the ceiling above my toybox , and don't ask me why but it's so cute ! In a delightfully .... creepy way .... don't ask\ 
I'll just leave it be since I've already tried killing it before , ( hairspray didn't work ) unless it lays eggs or something . And well , thats it . 
Room is currently radiating creepy apocalypse-like suspense music .... I love my new Metroid game already . 8D
