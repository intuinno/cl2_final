Am traveling to Pittsburgh this week . Pray for me and for my cousin , thanks ! 

My goddaughter is graduating from U of DE Nursing School tomorrow , and I am so proud of her ! 
Am having a lovely day in Elkton , MD ! 
Went to Baltimore , MD , today , put a flag on my uncle's grave . 
Does anyone know a woman named < PROPFEMALE > Hansel(l ) ( maiden name ) ... I am looking for her ... please help ! 
I _think_ ( but I am not sure !!! ) I finished a < PROPMALE > piece of code today ... tomorrow I test it , and I really hope it works , without too many rewrites . I want to not think about it anymore ( and I have been thinking about it for a very ... long ... time ) . 
I _did_ finish a < PROPMALE > piece of code !! It will need fine tuning , but ... that is easy , compared to bringing all the elements together . 
Happy Birthday to < PROPFEMALE > Read ! 
I cannot seem to be able to upload a plain AUDIO file ... video yes , images , yes , audio ? no . I sent myself an audio file I wanted to share , but ... it won't . 
Am happy my relatives found me on Facebook ! My cousins are great people ! 
Troubadour Reunion concert was awesome ... brought back lots of old ( but good ) memories ... 
Happy Solstice !! 
Am going to ODTUG conference ! Food for the technical soul ! 
My brain is _so_ full !! 
Waiting in Union Station , DC , for < PROPMALE > train up to Perryville . No wonder roads here are so full ... commuter railroad is marginal at best . ( only rush-hour ) . 
And while I'm criticizing public transit ( which I love , and which has gainfully employed me for nearly 16 years ) ( thanks , < PROPFEMALE > - the ride has been amazing so far ! ) , DC's Metro , aside from its lovely vaulted ceilings , has nothing on New York . I was so confused buying a ticket to ride , that I finally just purchased a $20 ride ticket , and now I have $16.95 left , because reading the fare board was impossible . 
( There's are ( wild ? ) bird(s ) in Union Station !! Singing !! )\ 
\ 
Anyone going to DC soon , who knows s/he will ride Metro ? Send me a message ... 
Now really am tired , going to sleeeeeeeeeppppp .... 
Cousins , please check you calendars to see that you got my message , thanks !

Some say the world will live in Fear , \ 
some say in Hope . \ 
From knowing a nuclear noose hangs near\ 
I hold with those that favor Fear . \ 
Yet if it learns the strength to cope\ 
I think I know enough of Love\ 
to say that , for survival , Hope\ 
is woven of the stronger rope . \ 
[ NB : in 2001 , I substituted \terrorist threat\ " for \ " nuclear noose \".]" 
I think I have to break down and get one of those portable A/C units ... any recommendations ? 
Just sat up with my friend < PROPMALE > watching the JT/CK Troubadour reunion DVD . Awesome !! 
Still slogging thru code ... I think I have finally figured out a pattern for the last bit ... 
I just learned if I created Lists of Friends , I could see the status updates of just the people on whichever list I was looking at ... amazing .

Driving to Pittsburgh ... has had its day in the sun ... I like to drive , but ... NYC-to-Pgh , too hard ... but flying/public transit impossible , and car rental too expensive . It makes me feel ... old . Oh , wait , I am old . Nevermind . 
Pittsburgh trip good , all good , concert good , camp good , drive home long ... but home now , A/C on , cats happy , child happy ... 
Because of their track record of killing Americans , I cannot support a Ground Zero McDonald's\ ( viral from a friend of a friend of a friend ) " 
Does anyone in Queens ( preferably near < PROPMALE > Hills ) have a spare room available next weekend for an out-of-town friend who is planning to attend tennis matches ? This is a reliable person I know thru my Oracle programming life , coming from Canada , and he would be grateful . If so , let me know asap , either here or my work email ( first name < PROPFEMALE > last name at NYCT < PROPFEMALE > com ) . THANKS !! 
I want to get a flat-panel TV , medium size , and not at Best Buy . Any suggestions as to brand / store / good price-per-size ? Clues ? 
Hey people - if you are a religiously tolerant American , as I was raised to believe we all were ... please wave your hand in welcome ( and offer a hot dish ! ) while waving that flag ! 
Getting over my panic attack that my servers were down ... and thus Transit's Service Planning app ... but then Support reset an errant router , and ... all is mostly right with my VPN / world again ... whew !! 
Heading in to my 3rd tranist of Saturn ... am getting old ... ( Saturn takes 27 years to go around < PROPFIRST > ... ) ... 
Thank heavens ! My third transit of Saturn is still 4 Terran years away ! Whew ! That was close ! I am NOT yet old !!! 
Had a horrible virus on my PC on Sunday afternoon ... clicked on something ... hi-jacked my ability to go to McAfee to clear it out . Sometimes I hate computers ... 
I both like and hate my quote from < PROPFEMALE > Mead ... am not sure I want that \small group of committed persons\ " who will change my world ... to be the \ " tea party\ " ... I think I liked \ " The Ladies ' Sewing Circle and T .... Society\ " ( that word will flag in certain search engines ) . " 
Went to a talk on Vatican II at Fordham on Tues < PROPFEMALE > ... very interesting talk ... very interesting audience demographics . 
Two scotches on my birthday , and saw my first IT boss from 25 years ago ... very interesting evening ! 
Knee doctor told me we can do same things as younger folks ... but ... recovery time is slower . Yup !! 
Have not died , just am in throes of moving ... more to follow later ... hugs , love to all ! 
Okay , I cannot promise to not disappear , but now , we have 2 working computers and 1 working dishwasher , and I can FINALLY sleep in my own bed , so no excuses !
