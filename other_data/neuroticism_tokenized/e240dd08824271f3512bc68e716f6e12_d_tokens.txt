\if you talk to the right people you get the right answers \"- my grandma =] " 
how you see is different than how i see . i interpret objects , people , life , everything different than you , him or her . we create our own images and ideologies based upon observations . now take away those biases you have about everything you have ever known . what does the world look like to you now ? put on a new pair of eyes and you'll be amazed at what you can see =] 
if you for one second thought your zodiac changed .... i hate to say this ... but your reallyyyyy stupid .... really really reallllllyyy stupid haha
