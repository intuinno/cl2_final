In Mesa town for sping break . Woooo 
The tap water in Mesa tastes really weird ! 
Watching a show where these kids are getting birthday parties . The last one was a girl who was turning like 7 and the whole party ended up being like 30,000 dollars . The little girl cried because a bird was supposed to be blue . Spoiled .... Hate to see what the kid is going to look like in the future . 
I miss flagstaff . 
< PROPFEMALE > Gentry shouldn't leave herself looged onto < PROPMALE > Bacon's Computer silly :P something bad could happen :]

Feeling good today :) 
Attempt number two at trying to sleep . Good night . 
Off to class . Someone text me ? <3 
NAU's internet connection thing is really starting to get on my nerves .... Please stop giving me that stupid SafeConnect thing every time I go to another < PROPFEMALE > ! If anyone knows how to fix this , please tell me ... 
Hmmm .. trying to decide whether I want to dye my hair dark again or just keep it like it is . Decisions , decisions ... 
Last weekend of snowbowl . Supposed to storm tonight and give us some new snow . To go snowboarding or not to ... hmmm 
Snowboarding was awesome with all the fresh powder . Can't believe I'm saying that in April . 
It's crazy how it can be 20 degrees snowing all day and then 40 degrees the next . I love Flagstaff :) 
Today is going to be warm .. Alright 50 degrees out and its not even 10 yet . 
I really don't want to write this lesson plan ! So I shall continue with my procrastination yay ! 
Hope everyone has a good Easter ! :) 
Wow . 18 more days and I'll be back down in Mesa town for most of the summer . Not excited to leave this amazing weather for the dreadful heat waiting for me down in the valley . :( Can't believe how fast this year flew by . 
I'm going to make this week a productive week . :) ( better late than never .... ) 
I'm ready to be done with the awful connection I get here ! I've come to hate that ' SafeConnect ' < PROPFEMALE > ...
