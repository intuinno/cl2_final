I heard you calling me telepathically and I am very psychic so of course I rushed right over . 
Sometimes I try to have an open mind ... but it just gets shut down by all the facts that are in there 
I seem to have been strangely confused in the mind ... 
I'm being judged . Right this very moment . 
How much wood would a wood < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > if a wood < PROPMALE > could < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > ?
