Eepy . 

Rawrr . :3 
I just had the longest phone conversation of my life : Anyone top 6 hours on the line ? I'm tired now ... 
Woo o-o -o , no scho o-o -ol ! Yet I still have commissions to draw .. urgh . X_X 
Five commissions knocked out . Eight more to go , and that's if I can avoid getting more orders ... X_X ; 
Writin ' tunes . And drawing . Nothin ' better to do seeing as I'm sick . I'd better get to school tomorrow . :/ Oh , and Mayday Parade is love . <3 
It's fine if you want to watch me - I'm not trying to hide . It's fine if you're worried - I might be too in that situation , from your viewpoint . I have an open mind to talk if there's something you don't like , but what if I just don't like starting conversation ? 
\ ' Cause the spaces between my fingers are right where yours fit perfectly . \ " // Owl City - Vanilla Twilight " 
feels stalked . XD 
I've said it before and I'll say it ' til it's done : I can't WAIT to get out of this mess . Off to Flint tomorrow after school , I can't wait . <3 
I . Am . SO . Happy . This weekend was exactly what I needed , wanted , and I've loved it . 
Am I really that hard to understand ? Or do I talk in circles and not realize it ? Sigh ... Oh well . I made a snowman yesterday , was fun . Thanks a bundle for the help < PROPMALE > ! <3 
So I missed the talent show meeting today ... gr . Didn't even know where it was being held . People in my fourth hour should learn to st*u . I really wanted to sing . :/ 
ACT outta the way - can't wait ' til these next two days are over , I'm overwhelmed . Tests , babysitting , homework , and no time to < PROPFEMALE > out . : < 
This has been an ... interesting week . I need to remember to bug < PROPFEMALE > about whether she has a sewing machine so I can try and magic up a costume ... Sis ! Dun let me forget ! D: 
My neice and I got sick with the same bug ... whatever it is . Just goes to show you that when we spend time together everything goes wrong . Can't believe I'm out and it's only the beginning of the new tri . :/ 
What's with the sudden joining the army/navy/marines/etc . thing ? I have nothing against the armed forces , it just bothers me that so many of my friends seem to be making that decision so quickly ... That's too many people to lose track of , or lose in all . Be careful . <3 Sigh . Homework all weekend , maybe that'll make me calm down . :/ 
Blindside was a good movie . :3 
Chou has that talent I want , if only we could trade ... haha . At least the guy's cheered up now . How does a laptop fall on a cinder block on accident anyway ? It's been a weird day ... 
Random mini-question to no one in particular : What's the weirdest combo of moods that someone can have / be in at once ? :/ 
Yay ice cream sandwiches , boo homework ... My advice is that AP Chem is hardly worth the effort one puts into it , haha ... On another note , I need to figure out how to make a Pokeball look / behave \real\ " by next Tuesday at any rate . > w < " 
Don't put on that smile , don't say those nice things . Don't sugar-coat things , especially yourself . Take off that mask so you can see a little more clearly . Because if you're only out to help others , everything will come back to hurt you . 
Our speech went AMAZING ! And to think I hate talking in front of people , lol . With all the praise we got that might've changed in me for good . Thanks a bundle Hayden ! ~ 
Bonfire party was awesome , thanks a lot < PROPFIRST > ! Haha . Oh , and just to put it out there , Auradria Power ish mine all mine . < PROPFEMALE > friends ' til the end ! Haha love ya sis . <3 
This is impossible ! - said the Reason . This is desperate ! - noticed the Experience . This is useless ! - cut the Pride . Just try ... - whispered the Dream . 
. . . My mom's finally fed up with < PROPFEMALE>'s antics and she'll be headed to the Humane Society sometime soon . In a way I can't deal with her either , but she was really my first cat ... I wish she'd just behave so we wouldn't have to get rid of her . She's sick on top of it so she'll prolly get put down ... I love you ya little scoopable troublemaker . T^T 
Hm . Well , I dun think that Chem test tomorrow is gonna blow over easy . At least after this we get fun labs to do . :3 
Hum . I usually don't bother hanging out with people , but change is always good , eh ...? I had a good day , yay . :DD 
I don't even feel like I'm in my life any more . I can't complain , not in the least bit . I'm liking this , it's just so foreign ... :) 
Life has a funny way of seakin ' up on ya when ya think everything's okay , and everything's goin ' right ... And life has a funny way of helpin ' ya out when ya think everything's gone wrong , and everything blows up in your face ... 
Ask me your qquestions , tell me your lies . Everything that comes out of your mouth is a surprise . You're half what meets my ears , and none what meets my eyes . So take a bit to listen to these words to the wise ... 
Happy Mother's Day ! ~ That includes my own , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > ( I miss you ) , Grandma , Maddy , and all the others out there ! <3 
... I'm stupid so if people get invites from me for something here on fb , don't listen to them . :/ Eh . Anyway , school's prolly gonna be boring now that the AP Chem test has passed , but with easy comes boring ... At least friends are always entertaining . <3 
Wee ! Good mood , good mood ~ So , who else is goin ' to the concert tonight ? Besides the performers in the bands of course ... :) 
Way-to-go band !! The concert , varsity , symphonic and jazz bands did awesome for their end of the year concert ~ The < PROPFEMALE > Wars theme was my personal fave . :P Great job everyone ! 
Ahh , the wonders of Swedish and < PROPMALE > techno . <3 
Ahh , amazing days are amazing , and moreso when spent with amazing people ~ :) 
Baby , you weren't the first , or the last , or the worst . I've gotta fill the blanks in this past with a verse . We can sit around and cry but , frankly , you're not worth it any more ... ~ Mayday Parade <3 
>___< Fricken messages won't work . Sorry guys . I dunno if it's FB or my computer , but either way I'mma kick one of the two sooner or later ... 
Well , yay spontaneous plans . Anime club tonight . If you're free around six , come to the library . Lieksrsly . That's where I'm headed . <3 
< PROPFEMALE > , thanks for all the lovely birthday wishes everyone ! :D <3 
Step right up , shoot an arrow at the target . My heart is an easy thing for you to hit . Don't worry , if you\ 
miss , I'll let you shoot again . My heart is an easy thing for you to\ 
win ... ~ RJA <3 
I can see why some girls really do down gallons of ice cream for comfort food ... It really DOES taste better when you're depressed . 
It's ... Simple , but the thought there is so meaningful . Makes me wonder what I would say to me in the eyes of another ... ~ RJA <3 
LOVES homemade ice cream ! <3 
Ahhh . Ice cream truck , overnight campin under the full < PROPFEMALE > , yard sale ... Okay , so the first two were good . :) More yard sale tomorrow . Stoney Creek on Monday , yay ! <3 
< PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > kidnapped me last night . Spent the night at < PROPFEMALE>'s . Memorial Day parade was fun this morning . No Stoney Creek today ... It's still been a fun ( and tiring ) weekend . <3 
It was so EMPTY in school today ! Class of 2010 , as much as I like the less dense hallways , I miss you . : < \ 
Sigh . Walked around town today , also got my phone business sorted out . Tell me if you want my new cell number . :D 
My week sucks when everyone else's seems to be fantastic . Today rocks , when for everyone else it seems to have went downhill . Now how does that work ? It's going over the top for being the odd one out ... Over and out ? Sounds good to me , peace . 
I went from happy with a banana split to my weekend being jam-packed with homework . Oh well , I get outta school next week anyway . More banana splits are just a vacation away . ^-^ 
Oh my goodness . Got a fairie card deck , illustrations by < PROPFEMALE > Chien-Eriksen . She's almost better than < PROPFEMALE > Brown ! Nobody probably has any idea what I'm talking about , but I thought I'd share anyway . :P 
Can't do anything that would be a \bad example\ " . Well what else do you do when you just want to pick up a tree and swing it at someone ? There's a lack of dscipline in this world like no other . And people wonder why their freedoms are restricted ? What a laughable topic . I'd still rather < PROPMALE > a tree than laugh at it . " 
Welllp , the tip of my flash drive finally decidedto break completely off , after five years . RIP Verbatim 2gig . You will be missed . \ 
SO , while I don't think it'll be working for the outline I have to print for my speech in about six hours , I took pictures of the document with my camera . XD \ 
I wish school could be easy and just let me e-mail it to myself . :/ 
I'm not entirely sure if today is a good or bad day , yet . It's either gonna turn out amazing or horrible . I'm shooting for amazing . :) 
Oh yes , today turned out awesome . Bonfires are amazing . :) Thanks < PROPMALE > Drouillard ! ~ 
Ego sum < PROPFEMALE > sailing altus obvius ventus . Dea < PROPFEMALE > ipsa animadverto mihi . Meus pennae take mihi altus . Ego mos non cado . 
Little kids are so cute . At the bowling alley there was a two year old girl clapping at every pin that went down , her mom explaining bowling to her . I thought it was adorable so I let her have one of my turns down the < PROPFIRST > and set her up with a really light ball . She was clapping and giggling even though the ball stopped rolling two feet down the < PROPFIRST > , in the gutter . XD It was adorable though . I gave her a hi-five . 
\The Artists ' Alley registration for Tsubasa no Tenchi for 1 table has been approved . \ " \ 
Went through my whole room and have yet to find my sketchpad . ;___; I guess I'll move my couch and dressers and stuff tomorrow . In the meantime I'll be working on cosplay ! :D 
Thunder , lightning , heavy storm \ 
Too much rain is falling \ 
I want you here just to be warm \ 
You know , a dance sounds calming .. \ 
\ 
Random ( lame ) verse .. Someone should get it . :) 
My mom : \You've got about a half an hour to use the microwave . A Huge storm's coming through and we might lose power . \ " ... Why is the first thing she thought of 
Maybe I know , deep inside my soul that love never lasts . We've got to find other ways to make it alone , or keep a straight face . I've always lived like this , keeping a comfortable distance . And up until now I had sworn to myself that I'm content with loneliness because none of it was ever worth the risk . But darling , you are the only exception . 
I lost about $70 , a cool drawing , my trig notebook ( not that I really need it ) , a bag full of button-pins , and a manga .. all while CLEANING my room . \ 
Please tell me this happens to other people too . D:

I hate following so many people on dA and then neglecting my inbox . D: 
So I'm petting my cat , and she decides to wrap around my arm and start licking all over my hand . I guess it's nice to know I'm loved , even in a creepy way . 
People . My computer's stupid . My chat thingy at the bottom right or whatever dun wanna work right the lot of the time . I'm not avoiding anyone . Ayiyi . D: 
Bokutachi wa ! Ya ku so ku yo , shitakunachatta ~ 
I look at myself a few years ago and think , \Wow 
Well the 7-11 across the street from me was out of small cups , so no free Slurpee for us today . Thanks for the tip anyway < PROPFEMALE > ! Glad I got to see ya ! :D 
I had to : \ 
They say true\ 
friends can go long periods of time without speaking & never\ 
question your friendship . This type of friend picks up like they just\ 
spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it's been , or how far away they\ 
live . They understand that life's busy\ 
but , that you'll always love them ... Repost this if you're lucky to\ 
have @ least 1 of these friends . I am privileged to say that I do . 
Ahh , 90s country music . Nice to get a break from all the rock and J-pop . 
I hate it when scars itch . For once I don't mean something like that metaphorically . 
Well the curls washed away after a swim with my niece and nephews . Back to sanity ! That is , my hair anyway ... 
Those foam pool noodle things suck . Bigtime . The only thing they could possibly be useful for is having a flimsy sword fight in a department store . And it wouldn't even be that fun . 
I love peanut butter bagels , kthxbai . 
< PROPMALE>'s spending the night . His parents kind of hate me for introducing Animal Crossing to him . ... I kinda do too . :/ 
Between the two World Wars , France\ 
was controlled by forty different governments . Why do I run across these kinds of things at one in the morning ..? 
I want to watch Pay It Forward now . Our neighbor is a prime example of that movie . < PROPFEMALE > and I are gonna help him put his fence up tomorrow , and cut his grass . Nice neighbors are a good thing to have , and be . /sentimental 
To whom ( parents ) it may concern : \ 
Grounding your child(ren ) will not cure them of electronics , headlice , relationships with others , or your loose connotations of insubordination ; whichever of these you claim for them to be directly associated with and/or enjoy having . \ 
Thank you . 
The chain's all < PROPMALE > but the pendant's fine . I swear , my faery necklace is an omen of my life . 
What ? No cookie dough ice cream ? Eating raw cookie dough is a health hazard ? ... Then WHY'D you let me lick the spoon when I was little ? Were you TRYING to kill me !?! 
All myths and legends have a basis in fact . \ 
Fact is nothing more than widely agreed upon opinion . \ 
These are examples of territories more forbidden than religion or politics , I swear . 
\We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them . \"" 
I seriously need to join a choir again . I can hear the difference . o_O 
I love metal even better when it involves Liv < PROPFEMALE > singing it . :D 
Ran out of black thread . \ 
With like , three inches of stitching left to do . \ 
Fml . 
You can't make everyone happy , and whether you realize it or not , you won't . It's better to live today than waste time looking too far back or too far ahead , because there's too much for you to worry about in either direction . Don't dawdle on the what-ifs ; focus on the what's-now . It's not called being selfish , it's called knowing better . 
So , now that I've heard it THREE times ... \ 
Miley < PROPMALE > is in town ? What ? 
... \ 
I'm NOT on a horse . \ 
D:< 
o_O \ 
Why does this App keep posting things like every couple of minutes for me , even though I haven't used it !? 
I bruised the palm of my hand . \ 
That's actually one form of injury that I've never had , or even heard of before . ._. ; 
And WHAT do I wake up to this morning ? \ 
A cat in labor . \ 
FFFF -- 
Sheesh , I haven't gotten a day to myself since Friday night ! Not that I mind of course . I haven't had this much fun in a while , even if I'm tired by the end of the day . Thankies < PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE > ! :D 
WAAAH ! \ 
< PROPFEMALE > just had * another * kitten right under my mom's bed . This is a day and a half after the first one ! Come on now ! \ 
I wish they made a < PROPMALE > for troubleshooting kittenbirth ... 
\Hey mom 
I love it when things start going my way . Everything's looking up ~ <3 
It doesn't matter when I WAKE up ... Lately I never GET up until after noon . :/ 
Brookie's coming over . I get to drag her to anime club . Again . :D <3 
I have ... orientation in the morning ... But if I got to sleep I definitely won't wake up for it . This sucks . D: 
My schedule ... is getting changed lol . I know for a FACT I'll have AP Bio 5th hour though . But I don't have calc , or the other AP classes I signed up for . Wtf ? 
So I had to get to school early , get beat up while trying to spar , and get dragged around town afterwards ? ... As beat as I am I still had a great day . 
\Not as big as that TIRE that we caught 
I'm out every day for two weeks , and the day I REALLY want to be out somewhere is the day that nothing happens ? Screw this , I went and got a milkshake . 
The counselors at school were all out at lunch . > . o It sure is hot out today ... 
I don't need to impress you if you think I'm worthless , because your mind isn't worth changing . :D 
Today was a nice day . Riding around , milkshakes , and nice people ( one random guy even gave us an umbrella in that random downpour we had ) are keys to a good mood . ^_^ 
My new FTW stands for fuck the world . :D <3 
Time to piecre my ears . :D Now if only I could find those darn earrings .... 
Best . Day(s ) . Ever . XD 
I don't have calc on my schedule . I want calc . Bad . D: \ 
Anyone who knows , < PROPMALE > has it first and fourth hours right ..? 
STOP IMing me people ! For some reason they're ALL going through and killing my computer ! Please ! Seriously ! DDDD: 
I went to Coldstone Creamery earlier today ! That place has AMAZING ice cream ! Although the one we got had a really long name , but that's okay . Yay < PROPMALE > chocolate cake , and yay < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > for keeping me company . :D 
YAY epic chocolate-ness ! <3 
It needs to stop raininggg ! D: 
So , who wants to help me name my new biology proj -- \ 
... My new goldfishie ? \ 
:D 
I FINALLY got that chair out of my room ! Along with a bunch of other crap . Stuff was taking up so much space ... \ 
Time to clear off a shelf for Nibbles . I need to get him fishy things tomorrow . :D 
I love how dance hits put me in a good mood , even though I'd hate them most days . XD 
My cat ate my biology project ..... \ 
:( 
Friends , school , life , fun ... What a great time . <3 
Mall time with < PROPFEMALE > , hot chocolate , leaves turning , watching Home Alone on TV ... It's days like today that make me smile . :D 
Step one : make hot chocolate . \ 
Step two : make toast . \ 
Step three : spread peanut butter on toast . \ 
Step four : dip and enjoy ! :D 
Hey , everyone , I just wrote a new note . I'm sick of all the drama being caused around me and I'd love for it to just settle down . I don't care who starts things but I will finish them . If anyone has pending questions about what the hell happened with me , read that note . ' < PROPFEMALE > ? ' < PROPFEMALE > .? 
I tried getting into Whittier , but with that failed my first day at Northwestern was today . It's SUPER small compared to RHS , yet I think it's a huge school of the district . And there's a lot of interesting people , yay ! :D ? 
Learn to read the fine print before you write between the lines . :D 
Is Sweetest Day tomorrow ? o.O 
Happy Sweetest Day loves ~ <3 ? 
Calc is easy . ACED that test . Chyeah . And my teacher is southern . Double win . 
Being happy doesn't mean that everything is perfect . It doesn't necessarily mean you look beyond the imperfections either . It just means you take them in and make it through anyway ~ 
So , I'll be in Roseville in a few hours . :D Getting < PROPFEMALE > from the airport then coming back home ~ 
Happy weekend with our Floridian < PROPFEMALE > Smith , happy time at Youmacon yesterday with everyone , and happy Halloween ~ <3 ? \

Life's been good , week's been standard . I miss some people but I have my best friends here to make it better . They're why I'm here in the first place after all . <3 
What kind of high school doesn't have a Quiz Bowl team !? Bad Northwestern , bad ! T^T 
I miss you so much more than I let myself believe . \ 
Man , these realizations just keep slapping me in the face ... 
If all goes well I'll be in Roseville after Christmas . Told everyone I wasn't gone forever . :P ( Means I'll get to go to December's anime club too ! ) 
YAY snow day ! <3 
Almost got a lolitrap to blush today ... Sadly I think it's impossible . Oh well . At least people liked the presents I got them . :D 
Listening to < PROPFEMALE > play her new xBox : \ 
\I think I should -- Oh 
If I told you I was gay , would you go away ? If I told you I was bi , would you cry ? If I told you I was straight , would it make you stay ? If you stay by my side , no matter my pride , I would love you , always . \

You and I wake up in jail together . Using only 4 words , what would you say to me ? Note : if you comment , you must copy and paste this to your status , so I may comment on yours as well . Be a good sport and play along . 4 words is hard !! 
Time for everything to go on overdrive . :D 
I just learned the \I reject your reality and substitute my own\ " line from Mythbusters originated from a crappy movie called The Dungeonmaster which happens to have absolutely no affiliation with D&D . Or Mythbusters . Fail . " 
Ender's Game just took the place of my favorite novel EVER . How come I never even heard of it before last month ?

I get to go to Roseville Thursday night ! <3 And this time , it's a SET plan , not a PROBABLY set plan , so it's GONNA happen . :D 
Valentines Day spent .. walking around town and doing homework . I am totally okay with this . :D 
Job hunting went awesometastically . :D

< PROPMALE > poured an entire packet of Fun Dip in his mouth . \ 
Me : \NO ! That's not FUN !! \ " \ 
So . There's this Zombie Rave . In Pontiac . And stuff . And Bri and < PROPMALE > and I totally want a ride . And we can totally pay for anyone who's willing to give us one . If anyone's willing , go through Bri < PROPMALE > , cuz we'll be on her facebook all night ( if we can't go , but we'd much rather go ) . :D 
So much for that . xD 
I've been watching anime all over the place lately . Yosuga no Sora ( which wasn't that good , but was still win ) , Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica ( which is annoying me because the main character isn't so main ) , Kore wa ( Koreha ) Zombie Desuka ? ( which the last episode made it win ) , Freezing ( which I wish would advance better ) , Demonbane ( which is an oldie-but-goodie ) ... I can't choose my favorite !!
