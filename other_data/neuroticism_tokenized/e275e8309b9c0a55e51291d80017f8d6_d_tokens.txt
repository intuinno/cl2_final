Happy Palindrome Day ! 01/02/2010 For you morons out there , it means that the date today said backwards is the same . 0102/20/10 :P 

Is Graduating today . And will finally never have to worry about Tuning Timpani Correctly ever again . Oh wait ... Shit ... Alright one more time today , THEN Never again ! 
Is now considered an alumni of SCPA . No onwards to the summer . How bout a new film in Redlands ? Sound Good ? OK then . 
First day out of High School , and already working on my Resume =] 
Got accepted on his first job interview , but because of transportation issues , had to turn it down =( 
Just got my report card . All I have to say is FUCK YOU SCPA . Alright , I am so glad that I never have to step foot in a high school ever again . The worst years of my life are over . Now the \real\ " challenges begin " 
Damn , my computer sounds like it has a swarm of bees in it 
Hooray . Coldplay tomorrow 
Is on his new laptop at the moment . Which is very exciting . Now all i have to do is figure out how the hell Windows Vista Works 
It'll take forever to transfer all my music from my old pc to my laptop . But I won't stop until every album is on my new itunes ! 
One more day of being underage . Then I will do nothing , but at least I'll know I can buy a gun , vote , party in Mexico , purchase certain magazines , and smoke tobacco . But pretty much the voting is all I'm gonna do . 
Today I turn 18 . Today doesn't really feel like a birthday though . 
Just saw Demetri < PROPFIRST > with my family at sprekels downtown . Best comedy show I have ever seen , and I've been to a few . He was completely witty and clever , and the he seldom repeated any of his old jokes , and when he did , he let us know . Fun for the whole 
Off to Mexico City . Be back Sunday Night . Goodbye < PROPFEMALE > for now 
For you music kids who are going to SCPA Tomorrow . Good Luck , and try to avoid Ms. < PROPFEMALE > when she's in a bad mood . =P 
Oh , and enjoy the tyranny of the IMC prez . Make sure that your \tour\ " doesn't suck by questioning the IMC's Agenda . I love socialism . But last year's attempt was pathetic . Read the Manifesto guys ! " 
Playing Tennis is a great way to get over self-confidence . You think you're really good . But then you play someone better than you . 
Doesn't quite understand why my PS3 isn't backwards compatible . That's criminal . Now I have to dig up the old fossil ( which hums louder than a beehive , and you have to shake it to get it to work ) of a PS2 in order to play games that aren't even that old . Lame . Might as well play the 64 , blow in the cartridge and it works like new ! 
Hmmm ... Life is funny 
Not FAIR ! Thom Yorke is playing in LA This Sunday , and I have no way of going . 
Movies , It's one thing to watch them . And it's another to write them . Wish me luck 
The < PROPMALE > Tenenbaums is more fun to read as a screenplay than it is to watch . But overall it's still one of < PROPMALE>'s Best 
Hmmm . Paranormal Acticity looks strange . I usually hate horror movies . But if it was actually done under my average estimated film budget , and made it to the mainstream box office with the bigwig movies that suck , ( takes breath ) then I am very interested . 
Almost finished the rough draft to my first sequel . They are harder to write than you think . 
Oh , and yes , I did cut my hair . Now it's just short . And I really mean short this time 
New iPods are so sleek . If I was a sucker I'd buy a new one . But come on people , it's about the music . Not the face of the device that plays it for you . 
I would like to watch many more french movies now 
Has to imitate < PROPFIRST > Beck for a project . Yeeecchhh . I have no experience in news casting or political analysis . WAIT ! Neither does he . hmmmm 
I think I'll get windows 7 now . I get it for free , and vista is startin to annoy me . 
Is teaming up with @ < PROPMALE > to beat every rock band 2 song in a row without stopping . On expert mode . My fingers burn already and we still got 25 < PROPFEMALE > go . And they keep getting harder and harder ! 
32-3 Wow Well Broncos , it looks like we're the best in the AFC West ! Always have been . Always will . GO CHARGERS !!!! 
6 Hours of Geography is enough . 1 day to go til the exam . Now to watch my favorite show ever . 
Windows 7 just came in the mail . Oh man I can't wait to have an operating system that doesn't suck ! Like Vista ! ( Or anything by < PROPMALE > ) 
Is under the suspicion that I have pink eye . My right eye's vision is like I'm underwater all the time . Dang it ! 
Put some books on liberalism on hold at the library . I have decided to go back into my political spectrum . I have seen the other side , and it's not pretty . 
When I inhale helium I sound just like < PROPFIRST > Cera . For 10 seconds 
Rain is nice 
Curse you procrastination ! I'm suprised it's not one of the deadly sins cause it certainly is a bad habit . 
Finals week ! Goody 
Haha ! I now know the difference between suunis and shiites ! ( And the agricultural history of the world ) I am ready for my final ! 
Now all the climates will soon be under my control ! ( In my head that is ) 
< PROPFIRST > Mayes is still selling stuff on tv . Rest his soul ... WAIT ! HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE !? Talk about post-humous infomercials ! 
Oh how Daft Punk's live albums make up for being sick of Christmas Music . Everyone else's house prolly sounds like it's from the 50's , my house sounds like a rave tavern . 
Why am I up so late ? 
wtf ? The sound on my computer stopped during editing . 
HAHAHA . I was looking at job ads , and one of them is seriously to be a < PROPFEMALE > shark . And of course it's located in Little Italy . Those darn Italians and their mobs 
Is looking forward to some movie making tomorrow 
Goodbye 2009 . Headin on up to Redlands now to celebrate the end of the decade 
Finally gonna start editing what I have been pre-planning forever . Hopefully the HD won't be the only good thing about my new horror sequel 
I got a bop-it ! Random ? 
Same Shit , Different Playoff Game ... 
I now find myself playing Legend Of < PROPFEMALE > Majora's Mask on my Nintendo 64 . There are just some things next gen graphics cannot emulate . 
It's 1:28 in the morning , I have started to listen to Dark Side of The < PROPFEMALE > , now I must finish what I have started . 
You go Conan ! 
Goodbye Conan :( 
Semester starts tomorrow . Pretty psyched actually 
So I got two hillarious teachers so far . Let's hope the next two aren't duds . 
My house is now always filled with ambient electronic music thanks to < PROPMALE > Cuevas . Well I spose it's my fault for introducing him to all the good kinds of music before the shitty stuff got him 
ROFLMFAO . Shit is < PROPMALE > Cuevas funny 
So why are people putting famous people's pictures as their profile pics . Did I miss something ? 
Facebook keeps getting smaller and smaller . More compact I suppose . The future of social networking will be on only 20% of the screen so you can multitask around the internets 
Drove today . In a parking structure ! I got those turns dowwn ! And in the rain too . My dad says I'm too careless though . I suppose I need to adjust to traffic next :P 
Alrighty Saints , good job ! You go < PROPFIRST > Brees ! 
What am I doing on Facebook ? I should be doing my Japanese homework ! ?????! 
Wow , Radiohead sounds much better now ... 
< PROPFEMALE > snaps ! I need to finish this goshdarn screenplay ! And with actual artistic effort to boot ! 
Awesome day of filming with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Molina , < PROPFIRST > Konar , and < PROPFIRST > Vereen . Hopefully if it turns out right in post , this should be one of my better projects . 
DONE EDITING ! Oh bejeezus that took a LOOONGG Time . Video is one thing , but seperate video AND audio is much more difficult . And alot funner to edit as well . I think this is my work best since Good Neighbor . 
21 grams was a beautiful film . It is also the most anachronistic film I have ever seen . If you like being thrown back and forth in time through a tour de force drama with Penn , Watts , and < PROPMALE > Toro , watch this movie 
THANK GOD that The Hurt Locker won , and Avatar didn't . Looks like the Academy still has good taste . 
Rage Against the Machine isn't exactly appropriate music when doing Japanese Homework . Anyone know any good Japanese Music ( And I mean in the language , and not from an anime ) 
Trying to find the right music for the 8 hour drive to Tombstone , Arizona Tomorrow . =P 
Not fair ! I missed the earthquake today ! Being in a car sucks 
The rain goes great with a flu ... ) XP 
Today was kinda exhausting , I think Hawaiian BBQ will refuel me . 
Look closer into my profile pic y'all . And I didn't use photoshop 
Why the heck arent Canadian movies more popular in this country !?!? They make very heartwarming movies . 
Oh how my family enjoys skype calls from Mexico . They especially act goofy as heyul . 
So my neighbors are playing that shitty ass Christian rock . Ok Jesus Freaks ... Soooo how about some Rammstein right back at cha ? 
Well the chirping criket in my Geology class was annoying as hell . At least it helped make awkward silences funnier . 
I almost said onegaishimasu ( please ) and Arigatoo ( thankyou ) at a Mexican Restaraunt . Oops ! I gotta stop getting mi espanol y watashi no ningo confused ! 
Damn ! I should be studying for my Japanese test ! ??? ???? ??? ???? 
Kickass was pretty good . 
Damn , need to come up with a screenplay before next weekend . I hate deadlines ... 
Skins is a good show . The British have no limits in their television 
Muse !?!? In San < PROPMALE > !?!? Holy shit I'm goin 
I'm not thinking hard enough to listen to Jay-Z right now . What !?!? It takes mindpower to listen to rap ? Actually , yes it does . If the shit's good that is . 
And now we sadly watch the last episode of the funniest show ever , Arrested Development . RIP 
I seriously need to stop speaking Japanese in my house . I'm driving my family crazy ! They don't understand anything I'm sayin ! 
Electro always makes me feel better :D 
Well today was pretty fucked . 
Well that was a scary re-make of an old horror flick . Wasn't bad . But then again , I don't like horror movies in general . Too many scares . 
Mr. Pope , you were one of the wisest people I have ever met . R.I.P. 
Having fun chiilin on a beach with @ < PROPMALE > Cuevas , and @ < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Goldfarb who is good with her ukelele , go cuz !

Well once again , citations fuck me over and make my B paper a D . God damnit do professors even fucking look for actual content anymore ? 
Had sushi and watched < PROPFEMALE > Wars ( THE OG ) . Fun fun fun . 
I suppose having a cute face helps a greenpeace recruiter cause I was roped in ! 
Parents aren't home , so i guess it's time to blast the ELECTRO ! :D Me and < PROPMALE > Cuevas Love Electro 
Is it illegal to to have loud construction at a local school at this time of the night ? 
Well this is lame ... 
Radiohead and < PROPFEMALE > don't make me jump when I'm trying to sleep with my iPod on shuffle mode . Jeez , thanks Jimi Hendrix . 
Dis Jazz be hella tight yo . 
Leave it to a doubleshot , a cold shower , and Rage Against the Machine to wake me up . 
Ok , these late nights need to stop ! Jesus , when will the sun go down at 6pm like it's supposed to !?!? 
OMG ! I want to be in TIME Magazine ! 
Oh British girl on the bus , you were so interesting ... Until you started smacking your gum . I suppose < PROPFEMALE > corrupts their properness . 
Well I won't be eating at L&L's for awhile if their BBQ beef sandwiches keep burning my fingers . Ouch !! How the hellami suposed to eat that ? 
Holy Shit ! \ 
I'M ON THE COVER OF TIME MAGAZINE BITCHEZ . \

Well tonight had it's ups and downs . But at least I get to see my cousins tomorrow in Redlands . 
I love my family and my Portuguese herritage <3 :D 
Perhaps listening to the < PROPFIRST > Darko OST will help me better understand the tangent universe . And also help me get an A on my geology exam . 
I sure hope my next two finals are as easy as the one I just took . 
Well that Political exam was riddiculously easy . Good thing I actually studied this time

Someone thought I had hitler on my shirt . They then apoligized and realized it was Thom Yorke . Oh the humanity 
Now to spend my entire day studying marijuana for a project . Oh boy 
Weather as hot as 91 , Seeing my Sweedish friend at Taco < PROPFEMALE > . Having a creepy little kid stare at me . And about to give pot speech . Boy is today odd . 
Weathered the blistering heat to get a slurpee . I suggest you all try going outside , if just for a minute . Shade does make a huge difference 
About to watch Inception 
Alright , Inception was one of the BEST movies I have seen . And I don't normally praise movies . 
This is the first time my laptop has been out of my house . 
Stupid auto-tuned Obama , and other assorted youtube videos for causing my insomnia . Damn . 
Done with Summer semester :D \ 
That was the easiest 6 units I've taken . 
After a day with good friends , it's time to get dinner with my family . 
Hey everyone , thanks for all the Birthday wishes ! ( I would comment individually , but so many of you wished me a happy birthday , it would take forever ! ) 
I got so much numbing stuff at the dentist , now I don't even know when my mouth is open or closed ! All I can feel is the illusion of having < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > lips 
\A Single Man\ " was one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen . It even made me cry . Movies typically never achieve this level of depth . But this one did . " 
On my way to Six Flags . Hooray ! :D 
Time for Tatsu ( again ) AT NIGHT ! XD 
At Pink's hot dogs right now . Hope it's as good as everyone says .

Got a Driver's test today . Wish me luck 
I need to finish that damn Japanese movie ! Writing it is harder than you'd think 
Having my friend Yuya translate my script for me . Tip for film makers , it's good to have a friend who is fluent in your faux foreign films language . 
Just had a long skype chat with < PROPFIRST > Ford , and I tell ya , it was fun ! Gotta go clean the dishwasher though -_- 
I drove without shoes on today . I didn't like driving like a hippie :[ 
Haven't slept in 36 hours , got a film shoot today and tomorrow , pumped up on 5 hour energy shots and got a road trip in 2 days . Life's crazy 
Sigur Ros is an incredible band 
Ahhh Bakersfield . The foul odor of your agriculture makes me cringe =o 
Got to drive on a two way highway for about an hour . I also got constant nagging from my mother in the process . 
Do people in the middle of nowhere look like serial killers or is it just me ? 
Lake < PROPFEMALE > and the area around it smell incredible ! Worth driving through Bakersfield to get to xD 
Yes , that's right I just passed Weed . There is actually a town named that . Wonder what they grow in that < PROPMALE > ...

Now to explore < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > and find a taffy store ! 
Bubble Gum Alley in SLO . Fun fun fun 
I saw Tea Partiers for the first time , frankly , I'm not impressed . I yelled \Teabaggers\ " out the window . Felt good " 
So much damn traffic >:( only in SoCal ... 
Well , 2,380 < PROPMALE > , 25 coastal cities , and 4 motels later , this road trip has been fun , but it's good to be back in San < PROPMALE > . 
Parking is a fucking nightmare 
With so much free time in between classes , I've discovered reading can be fun . Especially when you're reading American Psycho 
Well acting class was fun . Now after walking half a mile to my parked car in the wasteland I'm exhausted . 
And then the fire alarm rang 
< PROPFIRST > Pilgrim vs The World was FUCKING EPIC !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
So apparently being an atheist could get me disowned :O Hooray for religion right ? 
I can't believe I stayed up this long playing Plants vs . Zombies ... 
I'm moving really slowly ... And I'm not on drugs ... Maybe it was the eel I ate ... But < PROPFIRST > said it would taste \shocking\ " ... So much for good puns ... " 
At my Avo's ( Grandma's ) house in Redlands . It's so emtpy !!! I wish I could live here for just a few months before everything is taken .

Just saw that Social Network movie . You know , the one about Facebook . I'm sure you guys have heard of facebook right ? 
Oh magawd its hot as hell ! 
I should be doing homework ... But I think surfing the net while listening to Ambient groups keeps my brain awake ( sort of ) 
Well 20 minutes spent on my essay , an hour screwin around on the net , and 90 minutes studying Japanese ( for an exam ) really shows my priorities . 
Since when does San < PROPMALE > get Thunder and Lightning ? 
Had fun bowling today with < PROPMALE > Cuevas , < PROPFIRST > Wright , and Xerxes < PROPMALE > [: Although we all sucked at it 
I need to get a job . Anyone hiring ?

Can someone please tell me how the FUCK assist.org works exactly ? I don't want to fucking smash my computer against a wall ... 
Yea ! I get off early today ^^

Today's shift felt a lot shorter even if it was 8 hours :P I hope the transfer goes through ! I love this store xD 
I think I'll try Starcraft II tonight , lets hope I don't run into any incredibly skillful Koreans xP 
It is very sad what happened to Japan yesterday , and let us all hope/pray/wish that things will get better and the tsunamis won't harm any more people , my heart is with you Japan
