Thanks for the birthday wishes , everyone ! 
Jury Duty Update , several days later : I was potential juror no . 45 out of that pool of 50 , but I ended up being the last juror added . The trial , State of Washington vs . L.S. , was expected to last five days , but stretched out to ten days . The charges were two counts of Child Molestation in the First Degree and two counts of Rape of a Child in the First Degree . 
Jury Duty Update ( cont . ) : MC ( minor child ) was seven when her mom's live-in boyfriend started touching her . Over the next two years , it escalated . At nine , he was showing her parts of a pornographic movie , and having her act out what she'd seen . One of the most chilling parts of the trial was MC telling how L.S. told her he'd \have you as good at this ( oral sex ) as your mother . \"" 
Jury Duty Update ( cont . ) : I hope that this very bright girl , now ten years old , finds some way to cope with what she's been through . We on the jury did our part , finding L.S. guilty on all four counts . Sentencing is September 24th . L.S. is about a year younger than I am , but minimum sentencing guidelines will keep him behind bars until he's in his 70s . \

It won't be long enough .

Utterly exhausted at < PROPFIRST > Bauer's Celebration at the Pass holiday ski party . Two incompetent runs down the easiest trail have wiped me out . Fun fun fun . 
Once again , flying home across the country -- this time from NYC -- and loving the GoGo inflight internet service !
