' s computer won't boot after the login screen . He suspects a boot file was deleted .

deliberately wrote his formal critique of \The Notorious Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\ " with the theme of reading a short story being equivalent to sex . "

poem'd . 
is going to continue working on his speech , but first : kwik trip run . 
is going to hell for following a meme . Look what I made : 
has decided he will graduate in 4 years instead of 3 . He would like less credits a semester and time to inflate his GPA under false pretenses . 
- here's to two potential all ( close to ) all nighters . Seriously , if my speech date is supposed to be November 23rd , and we move the speeched back a week , why am I going this Wednesday ? I have three papers to write and a presentation to go to tonight as well .

was accused of not being a fan of the Vikings for being worried about tomorrow . The fact is that I've been a Vikings fan for longer than this year , and that's why I have doubts . Yes , I saw that win over the 49ers earlier this season , but do you remember 1998 ? Do you know the story of Super Bowl 4 ? Honestly , if they lose , I'll be upset , but I might not be surprised . 
isn't happy , but he saw it coming . 
- also , to those who're complaining about the refs : watch more football . It happens . The refs made some bad calls during the game tonight , but the Vikings lost the game themselves . Sucks , doesn't it ? 
- the original iPad : 
why do , some people , when quoting song lyrics , put , a , comma , when , it's , a new , line , that , s not , how , english works , you , look , r , i , d , i , c , u , l , o , u , s ,,

just finished an 9 < PROPFEMALE > essay test on symbols , themes , and the elements of comedy that he was allowed four hours to write after receiving the questions . 
- The Colts apparently had the leading passer , rusher , receiver , and sacksman in the Super Bowl . Heh . 
- one game of madden and then 3 more pages of single spaced Shakespeare Hell . 
- triva literally translates ( latin ) into \three way . \ " The more you know . " 
doesn't like waking up this early when he got to sleep relatively late . Back to bed ... 
does not have classes until Friday . 
lol , PL . 
was a bad < PROPFIRST > . He shouldn't try to mix \ghetto speak\ " with Elizabethan english when talking to a drunk person . \ " Forsooth that mofo hat slain this mine spleen fo-rizzle\ " should have never been said . " 
has spent 8+ hours every day in the lounge for the last two weeks working on schoolwork .

has been listening to The Decemberists since 2005 , and they're sitll fresh whenever you give them a break for a month or two . That said , Summersong and The Chimbley Sweep > anything off The Hazards of Love .

thinks English/Creative Writing is in third place behind Political Science and Psychology ( in that order ) in the the difference between the number of people who think they know what they're talking about and the number of people who know what they're talking about . 
- Willach Butlerhands : best president the United States has ever had .

- * insert unknowingly-pretentious-when-taken-out-of-context quote from the story/poem/essay he just read * Am I normal now ? 
just finished a full , what was the word ?, pastiche ? of Eliot's Prufrock . 
thinks the key difference between an English < PROPMALE > and a < PROPMALE > ( though they're not exclusive things to be ) is that English < PROPMALE > s neither care about nor correct your spoken grammar . 
just watched the music video for Telephone , apparent sequal to Paparazzi . Subtle and not-so-subtle imagery ? Check . Gaga dives into lesbianism after the cigarette glasses blur her gender-perception ? Check . The feminist movement may be in full swing again once someone explains to the average pop-listener , male and female , what's going on . 
nap time 
finished his full emulation of T.S. Eliot's \The Love Song of J . < PROPMALE > Prufrock . \ " You should check it out . "

is disturbed by the average 4channer's lack of knowledge regarding Luelinks . I mean , well , wow . 
doesn't get to sleep tonight because of small black guy and retarded white girls in the 2nd Morey Lounge . 
believe that , just like on any other day , people who aren't that funny shouldn't make jokes . I've already heard a few \so-and-so has died\ " s this morning . " 
has a couple really big baseball fans on his friend's list , and nobody has posted the < PROPFIRST > Buehrle play yet ... wow . 
is off to Kwik Trip before he starts a Creative Nonfiction essay . 
wants to know who this taller guy in the 2nd Morey lounge is . I never want to associate with anyone he's related to . 
received the first A+ Dr. < PROPMALE > has given out all year . Apparently he's also only given out 8 in his career . 
wants to watch some Hey < PROPMALE > . 
was just loaned 2 poetry anthologies by Dr. Armstrong . Time to read imo .

got his A in Writing in Communities ... just waiting on Creative Nonfiction . 
just got back from an < PROPFEMALE > Cooper and < PROPMALE > Zombie concert . Yayz . 
got his A in Creative Nonfiction , which , when added to the A in Modernism and the A in Writing in Communities and the D in Shakespeare , gives him a 3.25 GPA for the semester . 
10 people at Spaine lol . 
loses half of a < PROPFEMALE > of News Feed when someone likes \There are weird similarities between < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > F . Kennedy ... \ " Didn't we all learn this crap when we were ten or twelve or maybe even fourteen ? " 
\Again I must remind you that A Dog's a Dog -- A Cat's a Cat . \""

- D: 
- prediction : Kobe scores 40 and gets the < PROPMALE > trophy . Celtics win . 
- happy father's day 
- apparently not many people noticed that the garbageman in Toy Story 3 is < PROPMALE > . Note the t-shirt and obnoxious noises . 
- the chick I sit next to in Environmental Science brought snack food and a plastic container filled with chips . This is going to get old fast ... :/ 
- 2 tortillas + 4 pieces of cheese slices = 1 quesadilla . 
- wooo , keys jangling ... kshawww , kshawwkshksh , and then she starts munching on some chips . ( ? ??? )

has achieved every achievement available in Halo 3 , Halo ODST , and Halo Wars . Woo . 
- 8 credits worth of A's this summer . :3

- Lebron < PROPFIRST > fatheads available for $17.41 on the official fathead website . Apparently it's no coincidence that 1741 is the year < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > was born . 
- if everyone is telling the truth on here , then all of you have more on your mind than I or anyone else could imagine . Good job . 
- Like this status\ 
and I'll tell you one thing I like about you , one thing I dislike\

that Young Forever by Jay-Z , if taken as it should be , a response to \ 
Alphaville's Forever Young and not a cover , is pretty good . 
is going to head to the mall for a bit . Weee . :3 
- ok , so , feeling the blood run down the inside of your leg after a muscle strain is a very , very , very awkward thing . 
- The part in The Sun Also Rises , the day before the bulls when they're getting everything ready in the square , I get the same nostalgic feeling I remember from waiting for a festival in Harvest < PROPFEMALE > . I think that means Hemingway wins . 
- Favre is unofficially not coming back . :/ 
watched a great movie each of the last three nights : Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind , Being < PROPFIRST > Malkovich , and A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints . 
- sooo good/terrible . 
has a headache and is irritable . Sorry in advance .

is heading over to get fitted for the tux . 
is anyone in < PROPFEMALE > already ? 
has been de-friended by quite a few people recently . Who's next ? 
' s step-dad lost a finger to an electric saw . Outside of some pain and the finger being gone , he's doing surprisingly well . 
locked all the doors . He's alone , and he doesn't know if or when \The Killer\ " is coming . "

does not have a brain tumor . Yayz . 
just listened as a group of drunkards arrived home , realized one of their friends was missing , and left again to find him . Also , some other retard , on a dare , punched himself in the face hard enough to need his friends drive him to the ER . At least it's quiet now . 
is going to walk to the library so he can read Heart of Darkness in a cooler place . I don't need this much immersion into the setting . 
- time to head back to the apartment . 
finish Heart of Darkness 45 minutes before class . Wee . 
figured out what he'll write about for the Heart of Darkness draft tomorrow morning/night , but he needs to keep reading for other classes . 
the fantasy draft tonight is going to be fun . I haven't really spent much time researching , and instead of sleeping last night I wrote a paper about my reading of Heart of Darkness . D: 
- the Rochester Public Library is an alright place to study , I guess . Too bad I had to find my way over here from the < PROPMALE > Parking Ramp . 
is going to get some food then maybe come back to the library . 
has his five < PROPFEMALE > paper done for Lit Crit , but it needs some heavy editing and rearranging . 
bought a Mocha with five shots in it . They usually have three . 
is back at the apartment . The rest of the night will be devoted to Japanese . 
, since he first noticed him early last year , has freakin ' loved watching < PROPMALE > Leonhard play . 
- reading more than a half of a book of Literary Theory/Linguistic Philosophy starts to frazzle your brains . 
has the chalk ! 
hopes\ 
the 49ers can hold Brees below 250 yards or 3 touchdowns or something \ 
tonight , he wore his Deion Sanders 49ers jersey today as if it might \ 
provide some help to their secondary . 
just read up a little on l'ecritive feminine ; it's pretty cool ... pretty cool . 
- so , there's a very real possibility that the Vikings lose to the Lions and start 0-3 tomorrow . I'm not saying it will happen , and I hope it doesn't , but it's possible . 
- so , I lose my fantasy football match-up this week if < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > scores 29 more points than Ladainian Tomlinson . 
- no Lit Crit today . :/ 
- apparently the time for Japanese this Spring changed , so , as of right now , I can take Syntax next semester . 
wa genki desu yo ? 
was removed from somebody's facebook-friend's list because \[his ] poetry conflicted with [ her ] religious views . \ " Am ... am I an år†ï§† yet ? " 
read a book of poetry and two literary-criticism essays , wrote a 4-page essay , did some Japanese homework , and read through/did the assignments for two grammar lessons tonight . Oh , and he watched the Pats/Fins game and is now 4-0 in fantasy football . 
- I believed that Moss was going to rip apart the league with the Patriots again this year . Now that he's on the Vikings , I'm hesitantly optimistic that he'll do well , like any longtime Vikings fan should be . :/ 
believes philosophical literary criticism is still the slowest reading ever . 
needs a poem-reader for this fresh poem written tonight and due tonight . Any volunteers of the ' literary-minded ' persuasion ? 
- well , the solace I've been taking in the idea that \one touchdown will keep them in this game\ " has been slipping bit by bit . " 
- hmm , well , at least I'm 5-0 in a fantasy league where half of the members apparently aren't doing anything . :/ 
- hey , all of you hipsters who form your unique , unexpressed , personal opinions by consuming media , here's a band you've never heard of and is pretty good imo . http://www.facebook.com/pages/Vermilion-Club/150536888312610 
- I've never felt like writing a story instead of a poem until right now . I hope it passes , but if it doesn't I'll just have to put on my F . < PROPFIRST > mask and pretend . 
got a 98% on the Japanese test . Good thing he studied . 
- was called a sexist by a feminist after mentioning in Mugby that he wanted to try feminine writing . < PROPFEMALE > Howe or Djuana Barnes much ? 
- as far as McDonalds Monopoly goes , there is one ' rare ' piece for each color of properties ( and one rare piece for the railroads ) . If you have Boardwalk ( the rare piece between Boardwalk and Park Place ) , you're better off buying McDonalds until you find a Park Place . You waste at most maybe $100+ looking for the piece there are hundreds of thousands or millions of . 
- thanks , literary criticism . The essay \Female Masculinity\ " by < PROPFEMALE > Halberstam has effectively ruined < PROPFIRST > Bond for me . " 
poem'd last night . 
- \Poetry is shot in the head and walks down the alley pissing on its legs . \ " - < PROPFIRST > Bukowski . " 
- well , fantasy football is 90% confirmed a loss , but maybe the Vikings will tonight . :/ 
- other than being gimpy , Favre played traditional Favre-ball tonight , and it worked out like it does sometimes . Last year was really his off ( different ) year . The review on Shiancoe's catch wasn't accurate ( in my opinion ) , but you can't sit around and blame it entirely on that either . It was a good game , honestly . 
- oh , Favre has an avulsion fracture and a stress fracture in his ankle and is wearing a boot . :/ 
- < PROPMALE > Smith and < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > should combine for 38 more points than < PROPFIRST > Manningham . Please ? 
needs someone to go to Perkins with tonight . 
just saw and talked to Dr. Carducci in Rochester . D: 
am I meta-hip if I complain about hipsters being to loud in a cafe and ruining my opportunity to write ? 
would like to openly thank his ( future ) in-laws who have informed him that what he wants to do with his life is entirely useless and have acted as if he and most other people are of a lesser species . You're truly good people . 
- Since Moss isn't officially gone yet , if we fire Childress ( he's the only one who wants Moss gone ) before tomorrow morning , we keep Moss . Win-win . 
- Japanese Test 4 in 78 minutes . 
got a 95.5% on the Japanese test . 
will be an editor in chief of the Satori ! 
- not much soothes like < PROPMALE > Brubeck's Take Five . 
trolled a poetry recital tonight . 
- I guess I'll listen to Kanye's new album and then Heart and/or Set Yourself on Fire by Stars . It depends on how far I get before I just stop Kanye . 
is officially minoring in Japanese . 
registered for Advanced Poetry , Playwriting , Syntax , and Japanese 102 . He's still waiting on the blue card going through for the Satori . 
is at Perkins for coffee , pie , coffee , studying , and coffee . 
is a fan of The Heat and probably will be for a few years now , but it's because of Bosh , not the other two ( though obviously they're pretty good ) , and it makes me happy to know he's playing a good game tonight . 
\I didn't know Perkins was a bakery . I guess that would explain the muffins . \ " - < PROPMALE > Wilcox " 
“I write one < PROPFEMALE > of masterpiece to ninety-one < PROPFEMALE > s of shit . ” - The Big H . 
does not have Lit Crit today . Yay no class , boo no Dr. < PROPMALE > . 
got a 97% on his last Japanese chapter test . He also took the katakana/kanji test today , takes the oral exam next Monday , and then there's the final . 
:( 
finished typing up his grammar project . Now he has to shift the < PROPFEMALE > s to make it print correctly , write the 3 < PROPFEMALE > accompanying paper , and probably something else . 
isn't a rap connoisseur or anything , but Kanye sounds , well , smooth in Gorgeous . 
is heading back to the apartment for the night . 
is heading back to the apartment to grab a book then going to the library until class . 
slept for three hours . 
- 1 week left . :3 
is going to study until the Japanese final at 1pm . 
fractured his spine . 
- The Metrodome roof collapsed . When/where will the game be ? :/ 
- What sound does an implosion make ? \Skol\ " :( " 
nabbed A's in the two classes he thought he might get B's in . I betchya Krase took the concussion into account when grading the final . 
is going to check for his grade in Poetry again at midnight . My assumption is that a late night for Dr. Armstrong is 9 or 10pm , so I wouldn't expect him awake after midnight . 
beat bowling and volleyball on champion tonight in Kinect Sports . Yayz . 
- officially 4.0 ' d the semester now that all of the grades are up . 
- Danielewski , Danticat , and Kanye West : my literature for tonight . 
fantastically lives and dies with the Patriots ' offense tonight . 
- well , looks like I don't get to read tonight either . 
$20 to anyone who reads both Ashbery's \The System\ " and \ " Flow Chart\ " and is able to fully explain both to me . "
