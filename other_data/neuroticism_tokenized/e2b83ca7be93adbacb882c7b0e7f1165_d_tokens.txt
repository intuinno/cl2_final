Lost your pen = no pen\ 
No pen = no notes\ 
Nonotes = no study\ 
No study = Fail\ 
Fail = no diploma\ 
No diploma = no work\ 
no work = no money\ 
no money = no food\ 
no food = you get skinny\ 
you get skinny = then you get ugly\ 
Ugly = no love\ 
no love = no marriage\ 
no marriage = no children\ 
no children = alone\ 
alone = depression\ 
depression = sickness\ 
sickness = death\ 
\ 
Lesson : Dont lose your pen , you will die .. :P
