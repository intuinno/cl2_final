Bazinga ! The Big Dipper is saved from Roller Coaster oblivion ! There is a God and She loves \air time\ " and negative G's! " 

< PROPMALE > , we have a problem .... 
Futility , thy name is < PROPMALE > 
Buckeye nation must be gripping right about now ....................... 
Well , there's always the Sav-a-lot Holiday Bowl to shoot for ................... 
First Sunday that I actually watched a game that didn't suck ! That's the way I want the Browns to play ! More football , less sucking . WTG .... 
What selective hearing looks like for a mime ............. 
If clowns go the clown college , and evil scientists go to evil university , do mimes go to mime academy ? You'll never know . They're invisible . 
Some people give me Dain Brammage !!! Thankfully , there is selective hearing to filter out the noise ..... 
Ahhhh , springtime in Ohio ....... 63 degrees ...... went to pick up garden seeds ...... WTH ??? Christmas decorations ??? Somebody's got some ' splaining to do ! 
For once , I'll actually be a Steelers fan , just rooting that the hated Ravens don't advance in the playoffs ! Heaven have mercy on my soul . 
Now THAT was a good Super Bowl . Choosing a side in this game was difficult , but those that work with me know I wore green today . I've been to Pgh over 100 times in the past few years and made so many friends that I don't really hate the Steelers anymore . In fact , I hate the Broncos more , because they kept the Browns out of the Super Bowl in 86 , 87 & 89 .
