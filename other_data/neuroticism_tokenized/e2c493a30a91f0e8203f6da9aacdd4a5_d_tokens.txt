drove past her old house/neighborhood last night & got hit by a ton of emotions , then it was on to DeLuca's & some wonderful food , sharing of memories & really good laughs . People at the restaurant probably thought we were pretty toasted , but we each only had one drink & the rest was pure fun . ( Oh , wait , AJ had two ! That explains it .... ) Thanks , ladies !

On Breanna : Well we thought we would be out of the hospital by now according to the doctor , but Bre can't hold anything down .

These hospitals have great doctors but are not so clean . Doing everything to keep her safe from infection !
