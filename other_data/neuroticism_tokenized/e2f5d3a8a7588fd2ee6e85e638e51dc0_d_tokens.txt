If it wasn't for my random motions , blurtings and actions , I'd be as normal as you . 
The things I fear may all be imaginary ; so what I fear most is my imagination . 
Just because you're smart doesn't mean that the other guy is stupid . 
A weak mind is like a microscope . It magnifies trifling things , but cannot receive great ones . 
The only reason for time is so that everything doesn't happen all at once . 
Why is abbreviation such a long word ? 
The things that come to those who wait may be the things left over from those who got there first . 
Happy Easter everyone !!!!! :)

Every girl young and old has to face\ 
her own reflection\ 
Twirl around , stare it down\ 
What’s the mirror gonna say\ 
With some luck , you’ll measure up\ 
But you might not hold a candle to the rest\ 
“Is that your best ? ” says the mirror to the mess 
But there’s a whisper in the noise\ 
Can you hear a little voice\ 
and he says\ 
Has anybody told you you’re beautiful ? \ 
You might agree if you could see what I see\ 
Oh\ 
‘Cuz everything about you is incredible\ 
You should have seen me smile the day that I made you beautiful for me
