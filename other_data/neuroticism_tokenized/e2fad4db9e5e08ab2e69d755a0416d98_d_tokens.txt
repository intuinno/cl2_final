It just occurred to me ... the problem with government these days is : politicians think they must make laws that are palatable to the masses - ones that are easy going down and fill our bellies - like beer . Only problem is .. You wake up tomorrow , what you gulped down last nite has eaten your lunch today and left you with a < PROPMALE > hangover and a new nickname . 
Being a songwriter-of-love songs doesn't make me an expert on love , it just makes my hand hurt remembering what my heart felt .

You should be less concerned about differing opinions from your own , than losing yourself - because you have none of your own that you can defend .
