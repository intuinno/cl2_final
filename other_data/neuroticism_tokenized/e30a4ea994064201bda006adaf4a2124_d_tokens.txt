Just saw WICKED ! Need I say how happy this makes me ? 
Happy New Year wishes to all ! 
I really need a shoulder to < PROPFEMALE > on when I get home ... Have had a trying two days and I need decent humans to remind me why I changed my ways ... 
So ... How was everyones new years ? 
Why do people do stupid , selfish things and dare call it love ? 
friends are great , just wish I wasn't the only person who ever calls anybody 
coughing up alung is more painful than it sounds , especially when you can't sleep ... 
missing my vegamite-loving < PROPFEMALE > ... 
Happy Easter everybody !

So long , and thanks for all the fish ! ( < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > , I heart HGTG ) 
\To endure is greater than to dare ; to tire out hostile fortune ; to be daunted by no difficulty ; to keep heart when all have lost it ; to go through intrigue spotless ; and to forgo even ambition when the end is gained -- who can say this is not greatness ? \ " - < PROPFIRST > Thackeray " 
got into Forensic Anthropology !!! WOOOOT ! 
can't wait for this new chapter ... 
is very upset ... just lost my phone that I can't replace ... its probably stolen ... I really hate people who steal , especially when its from someone with no money as it is ... 
My faith in mankind's capacity for goodness has been renewed , my phone is back ! 
Boffing was AMAZING today !!! I am sooo going again next week ! 
I'm going to be 20 tomorrow !!!!! ( yay happy dance ) 
Teenager time is officially over , I am 20 today ^^ 
I LOVED getting to boffer as < PROPMALE > ! 
The Gorillaz concert is only two days from today ... wonder what it'll be like ? 
the cogs and wheels and hydraulics ... analog computers and space-traveling dirigibles ... dueling pistols , corsets and bustles ... spats ... oh gods how I love steampunk ! 
Wondering why I attract crazies ... 
( sigh ) 
I GOT THE JOOOOOOB ! ( INNER HAPPY DANCE !!! ) 
AHHHHH ! ( fangirl squee ! ) I just saw the end of season 1 of Kaichou Wa Maid-Sama and it was sooo cuuuuute !!!! -has been having a shitfit for at least 15 mins due to cuteness overload- 
And the darkness has a way of always knowing my name ... 
Sooo ... proud of little man ... 
I need to find a place to live by December sixth ... I am finally getting the boot . 
If anyone knows someone who can put me up for the time being ... I can cook , clean , and watch kids if need be . 
Yay ! Thanksgiving miracle ! I don't have to leave yet ! Now if only I had friends to spend thanksgiving with .... 
Thankful for my family ( figurative and biological ) , for my friends ( some of whom are family in the deepest sense ) , for my buddies , my coworkers ( mostly cause I have some ) , for God's grace in letting me live this long , and the opportunity to try to make my life one that my grandchildren will listen to with gasping , laughing , and attentiveness in all the right places . 
First night of work ... wow ... so many people consuming and consuming ... it was like watching locusts go through fields of farmland eating everything they touch ... kinda scary honestly . 
So ... one of my friends got ran over , I met the < PROPMALE > of Stockton , and I broke into my own house three times ... it has been a strange weekend . 
Curry is life ... mnn ... 
Flamenco music makes my feet itch ... and hips quake ... no fair ( pouts ) 
Change your profile picture to one of your favorite childhood cartoon characters and ask your friends to do the same . The point of the game ? To have no human faces on Facebook only childhood memories by Monday to fight child abuse . Copy and paste to spread the word ? 
This is the best morning I have had in ... God knows how long . After last night I know there's going to be some changes for the better ... ( VICTORY !!! ) 
Has no idea whats up with the < PROPFIRST > ... 
What will shake to the surface of tomorrow I wonder ...

Had my first relaxing night in a while ... and a good hookah smoke while I was at it :D 
Getting some friends together to go to the Saphirre hookah lounge this week ... let me know if you want to come ! 
FOREVER ALONE 
What did I piss off in the universe , and why won't it stop going for my freaking jugular ? 
Moonlight Sonata on the guitar ... Win . 
The chill from fear and forboding is formidable ... 
Send me a private message here on the good ole FB , and confess something to me . Don't let another moment pass !! you'd be surprised . 
Wishing the shadows of the past would stay where they belonged ... behind not in front of me . 
The love of friends is a breath of fresh air in a world with L.A. smog ... (: P ) why so serious ? 
Who painted the < PROPFEMALE > black ... 
Ah ... Chopin ... you never disappoint ... I am going to sleep to this ... 
Is going home for Christmas ... first time I'll be home in a long time . Can't wait to see my family ! 
Happy Christmas < PROPFEMALE > everybody ! 
Happy Christmas Day ! 
fChristmas dinner : one 20 pound turkey , 8 baked potatoes , lots of gravy , green bean casserole , cider , and six pies ... Im about ready to pass out from all 
fthat cooking ! 
Had a great day of cooking , family , and awkward explanations ... Love the fam but GOD can they be so strange ... 
Sometimes I wonder if living as a hermit might be more rewarding .. 
The < PROPFEMALE > seems so much brighter when the night is clouded and dark like this ... 
Dear Sandman : I am not a leper , in fact I'm decently healthy , but I won't stay that way if you keep avoiding me like the plague . \

P.S. Could you tell Morpheus to stop playing some kind of sick game of operation on my subconscious ... my dreamscape is already weird enough as it is without some experimental torture technique mucking it up . 
Need to go to a rock concert ... miss my old haunts and outrageous outfits and pounding music ... 
Feet feel like they are falling off ... owwww ... 
Comparisons are easily done once you've had a taste of ... perfection . 
Wishing I were a different species right now ... I am embarrassed to be human at the moment ... 
The acceptance of pain is the key .... 
EXCITED 
< PROPFEMALE > plus Seven-of-nine = Me ??? My friends ' geekpiracy theories just keep getting weirder lol 
YESSSSSSSSS !!!! DR WHO ! I has found it on the tv ! ( dies of happiness ) 
Feeling optimistic ^_^ Time to power through the things that always gave me trouble ! 
You know what I can't stand ??? Waffler friends ...
