Three Days Grace was awesome . but Breaking < PROPMALE > was better ! 

We can't spend our lives waiting to live . 
Big bang theory is probably the best show ever 
History is dumb . They shouldn't have recorded it so i didn't have to learn it . 
' Cause life starts now\ 
You've done all the things that could kill you somehow\ 
And you're so far down\ 
But you will survive it somehow\ 
Because life starts now 
finally got that photo story done for history . that took ridiculously too much time 
Every second counts cuz there's no second try . So live like you'll never live it twice . 
Each day's a gift and not a given right . 
Even if you haven't led it in long time , the football breakdown just comes to you at the end of practice . 
Leave no stone unturned , leave your fears behind , and try to take the path less traveled by . 
I dont even wanna go to bed cuz its summer and why waste perfectly good summer time with stupid sleeping . but there is absolutely nothing to do so really , i have no other choice 
football practice + riding bike afterwards = just wanting to sit here and do nothing ... forever 
Very bored . wants something to do 
ACT tomorrow ... yippee 
Couldnt sleep last night cuz i was thinking about many many things . 
listening to the ipod .. sanding the car wanna get it done but it is taking quite a while .. saw a commercial for The Edge cd collection on spike looked like it had some pretty good music so i believe ill be looking up all the songs and frostwiring them soon .. text me mobiles on the profile . 
internet sucks . no more video games for me tonight 
Sleep = bad i shall never surrender to it ! At least until the bored meter reaches extreme ... and even then its questionable ! 
discovering new and interesting music 
So do whatever it takes\ 
' Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life\ 
Let nothin ' stand in your way\ 
Cause the hands of time are never on your side 
will smith is my favorite .. seven pounds is a great great movie ... watched it again today 
Football time .. half asleep but sleep isnt worth it anyway so who cares . 
Currently listening to Simple Man by Shinedown .. Happens to be my favorite song 
Would like something to do 
ya know that thing where you are sitting down then get up and get all light headed , cant see , and fall down .. well that just happened to me 
big ol storm a brewin ! 
Laying outside watching the stars . Tis a wonderful thing 
< PROPFEMALE > is mentally handicapped cuz of her status ! 
I tried to type all the things that i thought about with one glance of the stars but the very condensed version was 958 characters and you are only allowed like 400 some . 
Internet : sometimes it just doesnt work 
pandemic 2 :: way too difficult ! 
I'm gay 
Im not gay silly < PROPFEMALE > . 
listening to bullet for my < PROPFIRST>'s fever album 
stumbleupon.com makes me laugh tis very entertaining 
made a football cd . mixed pump up rock and rap with a few lockerroom favorites . 
awesome weekend at wauseon 
Everything is gonna be alright . \ 
Everything is gonna be alright . \ 
Be strong Believe . 
Best , you've got to be the best\ 
You've got to change the world\ 
And use this < PROPMALE > to be heard\ 
Your time is now 
It's alright \ 
to tell me \ 
what you think \ 
about me\ 
I won't try \ 
to argue \ 
or hold it \ 
against you 
And how can we win , \ 
When fools can be kings , \ 
Don't waste your time , \ 
Or time will waste you , 
I know we have given\ 
All that we can give\ 
When there's nothing to < PROPFEMALE > on\ 
Well , I remember this\ 
All we make of this lifetime\ 
Is always here within\ 
And remembering that's why\ 
We should never give in 
I wont go down till im six feet underground . 
You think youve won this fight . Youve only lost your mind . 
If i was a superhero i would break free . Wouldnt need anyone to come and save me . And you couldnt make me feel like im crazy . 
When it feels like a kick in the teeth i can take it . 
Say what you want . Take your shots . You're setting me free with one more kick in the teeth . 
So are we breaking out or are we breaking down ? 
The time has come to open our eyes and be blinded by the sun . 
oh i know that but im right 
My friend , this life we live\ 
Is not what we have , it's what we believe 
ready for thursday to happen 
Fall is the best season ever . 
Playin xbox with the guys . 
Forgive ones enemys but never forget their names 
The world is now saved once again thanks to software from the internet . 
Half frozen apple sauce is awesome ! 
Its never too late to live your life the tidigs now its do or die . Its never too late to live your life the time is now its yours and mine . 
teaching tomorrow 
First day of cadet teaching . Here we go . 
curses towards e-homework 
For well you know that its a fool who plays it cool by making his world a little colder 
Here goes 
And there we go 
I say goodbye to my weakness so long to the regret and now i see the world through < PROPFEMALE > eyes
