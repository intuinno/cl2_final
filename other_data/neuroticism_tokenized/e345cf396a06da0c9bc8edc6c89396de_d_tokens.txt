There comes a time in life when you walk away from all the pointless drama and\ 
people who create it , and surround yourself with people who make you laugh so hard that you forget the bad and focus on the good . Life is too short to be anything but happy . \ 
... Repost if you agree ... I just did ? 
Home from I-80 Speedway where < PROPFIRST > was Dollar Dog again and < PROPMALE > raced his box car ( pics later ) . . . Some of the sponsorships of the real race cars leave my 12-year-old saying \That is disturbing on so many levels \"; I just shake my head ! lol " 
Awwwww jsut when < PROPMALE > seems so grown up then he snuggles in and says I so love you ; you are my Forever Mommy !

Just played a rousing game of Go Fish with < PROPMALE > which he won . . . Sorry mom he says , I don't want to make you cry , I'm just really happy ! 
Is there anything better than sleeping late on a < PROPFEMALE > day and then waking up to waffles ? 
Now < PROPMALE > is doing it he finally looked up and said \ more construction REALLY ?! \"" 
Wouldn't life be perfect if sweatpants were sexy , Monday mornings were fun , junk food didn't make you fat , girls didn't cause drama , guys weren't so confusing , nothing was regrettable , and goodbyes only meant until tomorrow ? Eventually everything will fall into place , but until then , ... laugh at the confusion , live for ...... the moment , and know that everything happens for a reason . 
\Ruin is the road to transformation . \""

Trivia Time : 25th Anniversary of this movie \ \"; and who said this \ " When you grow up your heart dies \"?" 
They say everlasting friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question the friendship . These types of friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been or how faraway they live , and they don't hold grudges . They understand ... that ... life is busy , but you will always ... love them . Re-post if you \ 
have @ least 1 of these friends ! love my REAL friends !!! 
Bobcats won today .... 4 to 0 ! 
Here's to parents who aren't inconvenienced by their children . Who don't view it as being \stuck at home with the baby\ " when they can't go out every night . Who value time with their children . Who don't pawn their kids offas often as they can on whoever wants them . Who accept responsibility ...... and don't walk away from family . Here's to ... parents who enjoy being parents . If you are one repost this !!! " 
Thank you everybody for the birthday wishes ; my day started with breakfast from < PROPMALE > ( toast with < PROPFEMALE > and butter ) , dropping boys at school , lunch with my coworkers , taking < PROPFIRST > to the dr. , soccer practice with 8 year olds , pizza , and now a quiet house .

The most important thing in life is your family . There are days you love them , and others you don't , but in the end of the day they're the people you always come home to . Sometimes it's the family you're born into and sometimes it's the one you make for yourself . ~ Season 2 ; Sex In The City 
Is at the Girls Inc launched ~ Madeleine Albright is the speaker ! 
Boys get to stay until 8 ! ;o ) Burgers and guacamole for supper ! 
For those of you who come home to someone you love ; tell them you love them . Coming home to a dark quiet house isn't what I recommend . 
Have you ever thought you went to the school of common sense , but you wonder what happened to everybody else ?! 
I'm a great aunt again !!! Congratulations < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > !

How glad am I that I am not the parent letting the girl out at school w/ black lipstick , spiked hair and guages in her ears ? 
There will be NO farms closed due to the ice storm !!! Each and every farmer will be out in the blistery , cold , blowing wind and ice tending to their livestock . They will be praying for machinery to work and non-frozen water pipes . If you know or love a farmer , say a prayer for him or her and repost .....

They will start a prayer chain so fast , They talk to you if you're down , laugh with you , cry with you , send condolences if you've lost someone you love , give you Birthday wishes on your Birthday , enjoy seeing you online everyday , enjoy the photos and videos you post . Re-post if you love your Facebook friends !!???? 
So thinking about my Mystic / Prairie Chapel neighbors today as we learned that < PROPFIRST > has been called to a better place . Would like to think that Dad and < PROPMALE > welcome him and now they are all talking cattle over a piece of pie . 
DEADLY TERMS USED BY WOMEN : 1 . FINE : This is the word women use to end an argument when they KNOW they are right and you need to shut up . 2 . NOTHING : This means SOMETHING and you should be wary . 3 . GO AHEAD : This is a dare , NOT permission . DON'T DO IT ! 4 . WHATEVER : A woman's way of saying F*YOU ! 5 . THAT'S OK : She's thinking long and hard before deciding HOW and WHEN you WILL pay for your mistake ! Repost and save a life ! 
< PROPMALE > : \there I fixed it are you happy ? Me : \ " Deleriously\ " < PROPMALE > \ " You are a very sarcastic mother you know ! \""
