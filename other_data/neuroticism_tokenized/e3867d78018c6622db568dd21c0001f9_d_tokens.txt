is still drawing . does anyone else have a tablet ? 
fuck it's 3 in the morning .

Don't you love waking up to the beautiful sound of a bird screaming because your cats are slowly ripping it apart ?

JUST DROVE . AGAIN . OH GOD . 
< PROPMALE > is so much better than < PROPFIRST > Mays . 
I /should/ go to sleep so I can get early tomorrow and not be restless the whole day , but where's the fun in that ? 
just got back from the beach with my first sunburn of the summer . Hey , at least I'm not deadly pale . 
cuddled up at my sister's house with two adorable four week old puppies . 
it's two AM and I have to wake up at six to make cupcakes . yayyy . 
just got home like thirty minutes ago . sucked up a lungful of second-hand smoke and played pool . Then went and got a < PROPFIRST > D's sweet tea . (: I wish we lived in town . 
just got home from steph's . I want to do something tonight but my parents don't want to drive me anywhere . ): and I can't drive without them .

I wish drawing was an exercise . 
There's a flair that says \Be careful . You might be a character in my next novel . \ " There should be one that says \ " Be careful . I might be secretly drawing a picture of your facebook display picture because I think you have a nice looking nose . \"" 
I HATE SPIDERS 
about to leave for my grandpa's cabin . when they die , I hope we get it . I'm not heartless , I don't WANT them to die .. but if they do .. you know . I wouldn't mind getting the beautiful place . 
I'm hoommee . (: cabin was fun . we /might/ go to the springs but the sunshine state isn't being .. < PROPFEMALE > . 
about to leave for < PROPFEMALE>'s . (: 
OHMIGOD I WANT A RACCOON . I just got back from < PROPFEMALE>'s house , and she has the CUTEST raccoon with the cutest little feet and hands and little nose and little ears .. he's even cute when he bites you < 333333

I'm painting (: I'm in a painting mood . does anyone want me to paint them something ? I like drawing people and using a photo as a reference . 
going out to lunch tomorrow , so I gotta go to bedd ): suckss 
I'm still awakkeee . :| I was painting . I'm painting a big thing of faces . and you might be one of them (: BUT YES I'm about to go to bed for real this time .

taking a break from painting some doorsss . I have white paint on my jeans , fingers , arms , legs , and nose . and I can't get it off .

My dad brought home a puppy ! 8D She's sooo cute . A terrier . She was by our house , and all freaking out and now she's really loving and < PROPFEMALE > . (: 
is cuddled up with this adorable , yet slightly brain-dead puppy (: 
about to go to sleep . I have to wake up early tomorrow too . 
just got into our hotel . (: We're about to go eat at some fancy restaurant and the mall . 
just got upp . I didn't know there was a meteor shower D: I would of stayed up to watch it . we're going to drive to tampa after we go downstairs and get some hotel breakfast . the hotel TV keeps turning on . its too earlyy 
I want to cut off my legs . just got back from Busch Gardens . rode the Sheikra . Had my eyes shut the whole time . BUT IT WAS FUN . about to go out to eat , but I'm going to post some pictures ( even if I was sweaty and ugly ) 
about to leave . we have another four hour driveee . about to go put the stuff in the car . ugh I hate unpacking and packing . 
just got home . I drove a lot of the way from Ocala to our house . That was like a four hour drive . And there was traffic . I'm so tired . 
about to go to the malllll 
back from the malll (: I put those pictures up , < PROPFIRST > . I havee 7 now . It was fun seeing a lot of people at the mall . Except < PROPFEMALE > left for target before I could catch her D; 
whoooo 100 friends I like this number . It's nice and even . (: 
I'm drawing (: after I finish this doodle , I'm going to start practicing on some photos . perhaps some of you guy's photos (: 
I've decided that vampires don't < PROPFEMALE > , and that instead of bats , they change into mosquitoes . 
Legally , It's Questionable . Morally , It's Disgusting . Personally ... I Like It . 
I wish I had friends who invited me to their house , instead of me always inviting them to mine . I'm tired of my family . I just want to live somewhere else . ): 
Orientation tonightt . I /just/ remembered it . ): 
does anyone know if we have to wear uniforms to orientation ? 
orientation was okay . I got retarded classes , we had to sit for like thirty minutes listening to people I dont care about talk about stuff I don't care about . I wanted to punt some people because they were blocking the halls . but I did meet a couple of people from a long time ago . And < PROPFEMALE > , from BHCA which surprised me . so that's okay . 
at home ~ I got some new converse . Now I have like .. seven pairs . (: 
about to go to bed . Thanks to Mckayla , < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFEMALE > , I'm totally not tired . I have to be well-rested to take on the first day of school without throwing someone in a blender . 
yes , everyone . tomorrow is school . and no one is going to Mosley . Thanks guys . ); I'm putting my clothes out and making sure I have everything in my messenger bag . 
less than 12 more hours until school starts . Anyone else feel like sobbing your guts out as you kiss summer goodbye ? 
yes , like everyone else .. first day of school . Who else feels like upchucking ? 
I'm ready for summer . Mosley sucksss . 
going to bed . school sucked the life out of me . 
school is better . it got a little bit better when I saw that Dekker had like no friends . (: but critical thinking is still lame . 
does any one have critical thinking at Mosley ? 
not looking forward to waking up early tomorrow . or 95 minute algebra classes . nightt everyone . 
went to church with the grandparents . I truly believe that going to Church for any religion is an amazing experience for anyone . You can't be a true atheist or agnostic if you've never been to church a couple of times . 
just got back from babysitting some oddly calm 3 , 4 , and 7 year old kids . going to take a shower and sleep . I'm exausted from playing chutes and ladders . 
at home . went skating with bekah , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPMALE > , and < PROPFIRST > . bekah is staying the nightt , and we all are probably going to go do something tomorrow too . 
my knee hurtsssss . < PROPFIRST > and I were playing tag while skating , and I fell trying to get her , and started spinning on my knee . It's just red . I wish it was a big fat bruise because I feel like a wimp complaining about it . 
going to the mall with bekah , and some kids from bay . and possibly < PROPFEMALE > . if you can go , you shouldd (: 
went to the malll . it was cool . I WON A LITTLE MICKY MOUSE DOLL FROM THE ARCADE . and bought some nail polish and skeleton earrings ~ 
I drove to the mall , which actually wasn't that scary . normally it's packed out , but I drove amazingly ( like always haha ) . Got my ears pierced AGAIN . and then drove to winn < PROPFEMALE > , and then home . I'm such a good driverrr 
going to bed . I started writing a little short Halloween story just to get into writing , and I would finish it tonight but it's already eleven . goodnight ~ 
the curious case of < PROPMALE > button was depressing . 
just did my homework . we're still reviewing in math , so it's super boring . 
just got home . tests in every class tomorrow . all my teachers think I'm a genius . My ear hurts . AND I SAW THAT GUY WHO PLAYS DEXTER'S DAD ON CSI : MIAMI . he was a murderer lolol . 
just got home from friday fest . WE RAN FROM A HOMELESS AIR-GUITAR PLAYING DRUNK GUY . 
went out to eat for breakfast . it was good . kinda bored . anyone want to do anything ? 
wants to go see Final Destination tonight , but my friends are sissies . come onnn it's in 3D guys . 
final destination was awesomee . we had to sneak in haha . no big deal though . I liked the main character the most c : 
DUDE . I HAD A DREAM . THAT MY DAD WAS < PROPMALE > . AND HE KILLED MY COUSIN . BUT SHE WAS STILL ALIVE EVEN THOUGH HE DECAPITATED HER . SO I SAVED THIS CHICK FROM A FIRE .. AND THEN I HAD THESE SCARS EVERYWHERE FROM THE FIRE . SO I WAS LIKE \): I HAVE SCARS\ " SO THE DOCTOR WAS EVIL AND I WANTED TO KILL HIM BUT WE COULDN'T FOR SOME REASON . and then my mom woke me up to go to breakfast . " 
I just < PROPFIRST > Octoman and Squidgirl . does anyone want to see ? c : 
got back from church a little bit ago . tiredd . did my homework , but for newspaper club I have to write like three samples . I have a 101 in my english class (: 
HAVE THE AMERICAN IDOL CREATORS GONE INSANE ? I can see them taking < PROPFEMALE > out , but replacing her with < PROPFEMALE > DEGENERES ? at least < PROPFIRST > is still on there . and < PROPMALE > . < 3 but < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > were always there since day one and now they're screwing everything up . 
fridayy making plans for this weekend . bowling maybe ? beach ? not another movie . anyone have any great ideas ? 
silly tornadoes . being number one is for dolphins . ;) 
cleaning my room . (: it's suppose to rain today and tomorrow , so no beach or mini golf . ): but maybe we can still go bowling or something interesting . 
today was funn drawing now . anyone want to do anything tomorrow ? c : 
kayne west needs to be kicked in the nuts . in other news , bowling was fun . I'm addicted to tea . I missed the deadline for the newspaper staff , and I haven't heard from Mock trial or the < PROPMALE > club . and , I'm reading Darkly Dreaming < PROPMALE > (: 
Interact meeting tomorrow at seven ~ and then Newspaper meeting wednesday . funn . 
interact meeting was good . it gave me more insight of what the club is about . if you go to Mosley you should join it with mee ~ < PROPMALE > club meeting was today but I had to ride the bus , so I have to meet again next week ~ 
So I write a whole new story because my past ones have all been gory not appropriate for school stories . The new one ended up being about a serial killer that cuts up and burns his victims . I suck at writing happy , appropriate stories . 
I have a 92.4 in math , a 99 in language arts , and high A's in my other two classes (: 
going to get my hair cut today . SHORT . I'm going to take before and after pictures . It's going to be cut at least 12 inches . 
MY HAIR IS SO SHORT . they cut /FIFTEEN INCHES/ off . I love it . 
going to kohls . I can't wait to go to school tomorrow ~ 
just made RAINBOW CUPCAKES ~ I'm bringing them to school since it's < PROPFEMALE>'s birthday tomorrow . 
newspaper meeting today . I'm the editor of the Opinion section . (: Does anyone have any ideas on T-shirt slogans for the newspaper ? The only one I can think of is \Making Waves until we go to our graves\ " since the paper is called Making Waves . " 
House is almost on ! :D 
House was goodd . I thought it went by too fast . 
< PROPFEMALE > HAS A NEW ALBUM . :D I loooove < PROPFEMALE > . 
NO , SERIOUSLY GO BUY MIKA'S ALBUM . We Are < PROPFEMALE > is my favorite so far , but Touches You is really good too . Lady < PROPFEMALE > isn't that good , but Pick Up Off The Floor is pretty sexy too . 
I'm eating cereal with a fork because all our spoons are dirty . It's making me depressed and irritated . 
I have to draw a political cartoon for newspaper haha . I also have to write my article . I would write it about the boxing youtube video but that'll be old news when we publish the newspaper . 
homecoming next week (: I bought the homecoming t-shirt today . And I'm listening to RENT music . haha 
went to visit < PROPFEMALE > and play with her psycotic kitten . and tomorrow we're going to the beachh ~ 
going to clean my room , and then go to the beach (: 
just got home from the beach . (: < PROPFEMALE>'s sugar gliders are soooo adorable . < 3 maybe I can convince my mom to let me have my own sugar glider . 
I don't want to go to schoooolllll . ): 
fantasia was okay . Wednesday is going to be a very busy day . Who's going to the bonfire , parade , and carnival ? 
I might skip tomorrow if dad is still sick ~ (: 
I can't wait for the paradeeeee (: If you're going , look for me . I'll be in the Interact Club's float . ;) 
the parade was fun . I was so tired after the carnival and bonfire that I went straight to bed , ahha (: tomorrow's fridayyy ~ 
Ugh . I hate cappuchinos now . 
change of plans . going to wild adventures this weekend . leaving tonight , be back sunday (: 
my sister and brother in law's family are idiotic fat retards . 
Wild adventures was nicee . School , however , was boring and kind of suckish . 
I just want to sleep ... I don't want to write a newspaper article . I have no idea how to start one . 
finally finished that article about the new teachers and administration . I've learned an important lesson : Suggest your own articles instead of getting the boring ones . I figure I'll do something about socialvibe next . 
I made a bet with my dad . He thinks more people are going to go to the seafood festival than the fair today . who wants to help me prove him wrong ? (: 
is practicing painting because painting is way much harder than sketching or using a tablet . :P 
Today , I found out that there's a certificate on the tootsie roll website that you may print out if you can get to the center without taking a bite . I think we all know what my new goal is . MLIA . 
I just have a very long conversation with a robot . I feel like I have accomplished something . 
I just lost the game . In other news .... OH WAIT .. DID I MISS HOUSE YESTERDAY ?!? Or was it today ? What is today ? Thank you Nexflix add for reminding me about my most beloved show . 
the newspaper might host a < PROPFEMALE > hawkins dance november 6 . :D 
ahaha .. poor bay . have they won against ANYONE yet ? 
If you could have one wish , what would you wish for ? I personally would wish for a big bottle of sweet tasting liquid , and if you drink a drop you could be immortal . then I could give it to everyone I like . 
I've decided I don't want to be Kayne West for halloween because I don't feel like turning my skin black . instead I'll be clad in a yellow hoodie , make some ears , wear some jeans , and pretend I'm pikachu . -lazy- 
just got back from Michaels and books a million ~ < 3 
IF YOU GET THE SWINE FLU VACCINATION YOUR BABIES WILL BE MUTATED , FIGHTING-CRIME TURTLES . ): 
ughhh FINALLY finished the < PROPMALE > trade I was working on . My computer decided to rest < PROPMALE > last time I st < PROPMALE > ed on it , and I lost everything . 
I just made about a zillion cupcakes . ughhh icing is everywhere . ): 
you better love your card tomorrow , < PROPFIRST > , because I just spent like an hour working on it . ):< 
drawing a halloween picture and listening to Owl City ~ By the way I hate people who say how much they loooove Owl City because they know like two songs and just started listening to them because of Fireflies . HATEHATEHATE 
http://fc02.deviantart.com/fs50/f/2009/297/a/f/Pumpkin_Patch_by_FaithPitts.png FINISHED . Took about three hours hjkdfg I actually did a background too . 
That pumpkin picture got featured on someone's journal . it makes me happy . alsooo , going to the store in like thirty minutes to get the brownie coffin stuff for tuesday , and maybe a small cake for < PROPFIRST > ( because I'm nice ) , andd a pumpkin that I will carve ~ 
exams monday and tuesday ~ I just hope I'll make a 90 or better on the math exam so my final grade will be an A . 
http://fc03.deviantart.com/fs51/f/2009/298/0/7/Ameila_by_FaithPitts.png exams are tomorrow , but I realllyy want to keep drawing . 
I HATE MARZIPAN . AND BROWNIES . AND < PROPFEMALE > STEWERT . AND STUPID RECIPES . 
Boys and girls of every age , wouldn't you like to see something strange ? come with us and you will see , this , our town of Halloween . 
I now have parenting , writing II , and personal fitness ~ I realllly hope personal fitness will be over soon . I sit by Makayla , who talks about the stupidest things . :( I do enjoy sitting by < PROPFIRST > though , because he likes zombies just as much as I do . 
< PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > and I are going to be M&MS (: I'm making the shirts right noww . I'm green , < PROPFIRST > is yellow , < PROPFEMALE > is red , and < PROPFEMALE > is bluee 
< PROPFEMALE>'s party tonightt ~ 
< PROPFEMALE>'s halloween party tonightt . I'm going to have to spend the night at my sister's house because it lasts until 11 ( mom doesn't want to drive thirty minutes there at eleven pm ) and my dad got called out . 
the party was pretty coolll ~ I left my rats in my sister's car though ;) I'll have to get them later . D: 
If I ever find out who ran over my pumpkin , I will burn their house down . Going out of your way to run over a stupid fruit is not bad-ass , not cool , and totally inconsiderate of others . You are NOT gangster for doing this . 
WHOOOO . Just got sims 3 in the mail . (: I'm going to make all my friends and then kill them by locking them in rooms without doors . 
WHOOOO . I got like nine answers correct on Cash Cab . (: It makes me feel smart . 
going to bed . I'm so glad it's almost the weekend . hope you guys have a wonderful friday (:

I love you , < PROPFEMALE > . You're my favorite Hurricane EVER . 
happy midnight . 
$1.92 is enough cash to give a homeless man/woman/child a thanksgiving dinner . 
someone should suggest something for me to draw . :) 
I get to hippy-fy my mother's jeans because they're doing something for work . Bring on the peaceee . 
I'm still open to suggestions for art ~ usually it takes me 20 minutes or so if it's not complicated . ( like < PROPFIRST>'s DJ monkey fighting lizards in space , haha ) I will not turn town your suggestions ; I need the practice . 
I hate nightmares . I can't sleep now . ): 
teenage angst sucks .

still taking commissions ( where you pay me to draw anything for you ) . if you're interested , friend my < PROPMALE > account , and comment me there . :D 
I think I'll try being a vegetarian again , but it's so close to thanksgiving .. D: 
every time I'm sick , I drink about fifty million gallons of hot tea . and about seven billion packets of those refreshing strawberry swirl cough drop things . does anyone else only drink certain things when they're sick ? 
Obey Gravity . It's the law . 
when I draw something and it doesn't come out good , no matter how must I try , I get so frustratedddd 
Happy Thanksgivinggg . I get to drive two and a half hours to my aunt's house while being stuffed into my truck with four other people . How nice . 
Veggieloaf tastes like baked stuffing and gravy . : x 
You : HEY . LETS MAKE A POEM . Stranger : .. okay u first You : Okay . You : Sun shines though my window Stranger : i feel dirty though You : because I haven't bathed in three days Stranger : i am not in a marijuana haze You : but I'm higher than a swingset Stranger : i am sad , do not fret You : I am a puppet and you are my strings Stranger : look at all these shiny things !!
