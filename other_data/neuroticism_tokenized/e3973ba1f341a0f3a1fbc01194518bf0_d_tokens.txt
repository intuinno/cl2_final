Dear Internet , Suck it Trebeck 
If the history of the Earth was condensed into a 24 hour period , the entire span of human evolution has lasted 2 seconds .... ahh perspective 
I was always taught the finite science side that Evolution caused humans to be here from multiple genetic variations changing species to species over billions of years , and the Christian side that God created man and all creatures essentially as they are now somewhere around 15,000 years ago < PROPMALE > . So my humanities professor says there is a church doctrine that says that God utilized evolution to create people ....

Science is fun .

If you have 99 bottles of beer on the wall , pass around 14 of them , have 3 yourself , 10 of your friends only finish half , 5 of them combine them and try to put them back to save for later , and 5 more friends go back for 2 more each , how many bottles of beer are on your wall ? :-) 
Saving files is for chumps , betting on auto-recovery is obviously the more pro way to go . 
I can do whatever I can
