Made the BEST CAKE EVER for the dress party tonight . OMFG ! * Tries not to eat it all before taking a shower * Must . Have . Self . Control . XD

Thanks to everyone who came to my party . IT WAS AWESOME AND I LOVE YOU !! And even though I was up and out until 5 something in the morning , I STILL manage to wake up at 9:30 sharp . But with no hangover , so that's a plus . I hope everyone else was as lucky as i am . =D 
Someone do free hugs with me in front if the cl1 building ! 
So , I have a small crush on this guy in my ANT4034 class . I finally got the nerve to talk to him today ( actually , he spoke to me asking for some notes ) but he has a gf . of course . But on the bright side , it's been a really long time since I've had a genuine crush on someone . That tells you how often I have boyfriends . >.< \ 
Happy vday ! =D

I shoulda just fixed my car when I had the < PROPMALE > . Things get so goddamn frustrating when you have to depend on other people for transportation . Ugh ! >.< 
So , I barely remember anyone from that speed dating event . It was kinda disorganized but whatevs . The people I do remember were the ones I met afterwards . So the \after party\ " was the best part of my night . lmao . "

I am über in love with Avenged Sevenfold all over again . I think this is my 7th marriage with them . =P 
On to theoretical Anthropology . It's like a class , but not ! XD 
I've been reading and writing so goddamn much this week . MY EYES ARE BLEEDING AND MY FINGERS ARE STARTING TO FALL OFF ! ( But luckily facebook and music makes it all better . ) =D 
A bird shat on me today . Thank god it was small . And not in my hair . >.< 
My professors are fucking awesome . I love the Anthropology faculty . I chose the best < PROPMALE > at the right place . =D 
I'm supposed to be helping this grad student with her research ... but she's stuck in Atlanta . So I'm sitting in the lab bored watching other people do their part . Should I be helping them ?.......... nah . >.< 
Nutella and animal crackers . I now get cravings for Nutella and animal crackers . Damn you , < PROPMALE > . 
Anthropology students are fucking awesome . I end up loving all my classmates every time . =) 
Super worried about my test . If I get a C or lower , I'm never taking < PROPMALE > again . D= \ 
If I get a B or higher , I might consider taking < PROPMALE > again . lol . \ 
I'm just kidding , really . The formatting just makes me worried . I really am just kidding ... \ 
Really . 
Still stressing about my test . Hurry up and come over here people so I can relax ! omfg ... * bites nails * . 
Soooooo lethargic today . I'm like a huge tortoise . 
People are playing Starcraft 2 . And I have no idea what's going on . >.< 
People are playing Modern Warfare . Now I know what's going on . =) 
Now people are playing portal . Now I REALLY know what's going on . =D 
Anyone wanna do something with me right now ? I'm bored . 
At Natura , which was cool and all with indie music and cool < PROPMALE > , but since it's open mic right now , some obnoxious guy is up there doing \improv comedy\ " . He absolutely sucks . And he thinks he's the best thing in the world . Ugh . I'm about to go home . So much for a cool night out at a cool coffee shop . " 
D&D for the first time tonight . My character was a half-orc rouge . I had bad luck with probability ( getting good < PROPFIRST > on dice ) and I was the only one whose HP dropped all the way down to 7 BUT I fucking owned when it was my turn to hit those goddamn minions back ! 
In response to < PROPFEMALE>'s status : < PROPFIRST > Drayer , < PROPFEMALE > LaPrade , < PROPFIRST > Downes , < PROPFIRST > Malone , < PROPFEMALE > Woon < PROPFIRST > . So I have a guy with lots of useless information , a woman with too many health problems ( we still <3 u ) , a tall guy with useful-ish information who can probably kick some good ass , a former hipster kid , and a Korean . I think we'll be fine . 
I've been so lazy this spring break . I figured I would redeem myself by going job hunting today ... \ 
It's raining . \ 
I guess it's more video games . Oh well . Tomorrow it'll be < PROPFEMALE > . >.< 
So I just walked an hour to school , went up 3 flights of stairs to get a lab key , went into the lab and then read the email that tells me my duty for today . Turns out , I didn't have to get up this morning . >.< 
It's been relationship psychology for 4 hours with awesome people outside of the Geek Easy . Pretty awesome for refection times . 
My homework assignment was filled with so much cock ! omfg . If I could post the PDF , I would . But idk how my friends here would appreciate it . lmao . 
U know this new FB thing called \Memorable Status Updates\ " ? Here's what came up on my sidebar . \ 
Does anyone have frequent flyer < PROPMALE > that they wanna give me ? I need a plane ticket to Taiwan . =D 
So much stuff to do this week . Busy busy busy busy busy busy busy !!! 
Anyone else going to Universal Knights ? ( I think that's what it's called . ) I got my ticket today . The line was super long so I found a friend that was in the front . I think I skipped , like , 500 people . XD 
Ah crap . I just realized that the quiz due at midnight tonight was actually due at noon today . FML . D= 
I love my Anthropology professors . While I was passing the time until < PROPMALE>'s thesis defense , I literally went into several professor's offices and just talked . Literally . They let you bother them for no apparent reason ! =D 
Just made plans with < PROPFEMALE > Woon < PROPFIRST > for specific flight dates . All I have to do now is buy my plane ticket and everything's official . I am going to have one busy summer ! 
Can someone give me a ride to school today ? I have to be there at 10:30 am . I refuse to walk in this weather . 
SOMEONE GIVE ME A RIDE TO SCHOOL ! ( please ? ) 
It's raining on my life ! My sanity is being washed away ! 
I got a ride to school which was awesome . ( Thanks < PROPFEMALE > Starnes ! ) Got extra credit for making an effort to go to class . ( Thanks Dr. Mishtal ! ) But now I'm stuck at school because everything else is canceled . Way to fail , weather system . 
Had an eye exam today and cannot see . My eyes just did a half hour workout and now they're worn out ! I can barely read anything smaller than the text on facebook ! >.< 
Universal Knights rocked ! I think it was such a great time because it was free ... 
Me : I'm going to Taiwan this summer . \ 
< PROPFIRST > : Oh yea ? Watch out for those human traffickers . \ 
Me : < PROPFIRST > , That's Thailand that does human trafficking . Not Taiwan . \ 
< PROPFIRST > : ... How close are they ? \ 
XD\ 
< PROPFIRST > Patlyek = awesomesauce .
