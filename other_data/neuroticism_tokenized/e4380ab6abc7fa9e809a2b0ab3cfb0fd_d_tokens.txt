It really pisses me off when people try to take credit for others ' accomplishments . I'd finish that thought , but she might be watching . Grrr !!!! 
married an idiot . < PROPFIRST > decides to shellack the dresser while it's still in the house . No need to take anything off of it or out of it either . Now all of my jewelry is covered in sticky clear shellack- so is my high school diploma . Way to go < PROPFIRST > . Not to mention the candle with an open flame he put next to the shellacked dresser to ' ease the smell ' ... If I die in a fire- you will all know why .
