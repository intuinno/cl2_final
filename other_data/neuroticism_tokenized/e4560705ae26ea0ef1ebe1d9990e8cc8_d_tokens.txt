If the world was perfect , Man would still find something to dislike . 
We learn from what we see and our whole reality becomes what it is based on what we sense of the world , so if from birth babies see what we make them see can we make them be able to do thinks only seen or heard in fiction ?

A friend in need is a friend indeed 
hello < PROPMALE > 
if youve tried to call or text me youve probably found out my phone service has been turned off 
Has short hair for the first time in 7-8 years 
so bored up here ... 
After some serious thinking , i have realized that One Piece is seriously better than Bleach and has been ranked up to my top Anime/Manga . ya'll should read/watch it , seriously , but not 4kids version because that is like stabbing yourself in the eye with needles constantly 
so i get on facebook expecting there to be the usual 3-8 people on who never message me or anything , but instead i find 25 friends on with half of them wanting to talk at once !! 
is Question #9001 !!!! : Why did Iggy have to die :( ? 
pwn pwn pwn pwn pwn pwn pwn 
nobody can fully understand anybody , not even themself 
I fear no evil ! 
WOOT !! my phone is back on !!

Pants on the ground ! Pants on the ground ! LOOKIN ' LIKE A FOOL WIT YO PANTS ON THE GROUND

What nicknames have yall been called ? 
so i just saw The Lovely Bones . was decent movie but i came out in a wtf ? state . 
is catching up with Gantz 
whats with the random days where the number of friends online increases by 600% 
im losing my sole 
so how do i tag people in my comments ? 
I read somewhere that men who take longer strides when they walk are more attractive to women , so if my balls were to touch the floor ever time i took a step would i be the most attractive man on the planet ? 
There would be no good with no evil , no love with no pain , no happiness without sadness , no healthy without unhealthy , no nakedness if no clothes existed , no day without night 
I think i may have invented human flight . You see , all you have to do is find a cat ( since cats always land on their feet ) and take off its legs , so that it will float cuz it cant touch the ground without feet , then you mix your DNA with the footless cat and BAM ! you'll be cruisin your way thru the sky highway . 
we look at each other and see people with like or not interests , however much we may think the same , we never will be 
I was about to type my beliefs on free will , religion and the univers , but then i realized it would take a long time so i didnt . this is my compensation for that . 
NOTHING is absolute

#73 I've known you a long time , and I have lots of memories of hanging out with you on the bus to and from home and many other times . You are one of the kinds of people I really like , you are yourself , and you aren't judgemental . Over the years I have seen you less and less , and from the most recent times i've seen you you seem to have become a much more confident and outgoing person . 
#666 HAHA When I first met you I thought you were just another chick who thought I would be interesting to talk to on the way home from the bus , and that was what u seemed like . Lets see , the only real memory I have of us ever really being near eachothr was the time you pet my cats on your way home . Aftr talkin to u on FB however , I realize you are psycho , in a gud way ha . But Internet < PROPFIRST > is too , so its all good .

Haha , you always seemed like an extremely sensible guy , and always knew what was right , and you knew me at the peak of my weird phase and didn't turn away 
4\ 
Well you and me were at the same english table haha , and even though I felt awkward being at a table with people I barely knew you never did anything to make it worse , in fact you three did the opposite 
26\ 
Lmao , It seems that after that Comp . App . project where we both awkwardly worked together , it turns out we're both friends of a bunch of each others friends :O \ 
You've always seemed extremely kind and intelligent and thats a + in my book . \ 
And your a great writer lol 
777 , I have no idea how the hell I met you , I think it was through < PROPMALE > at one of the cons >_> \

-7 , to tell you the truth , you've always been someone I kinda looked up to , you've always had great talent with the creative arts , and a very outgoing humorous personality . \ 
And even though sometimes you and they can put me in a bad mood , y'all do things I can really respect 
We're all just playing on the shores of infinity 
you cannot make someone trust you , it is something they decide for themselves
