Change your Facebook profile picture to a cartoon character from your childhood and invite your friends to do the same . Until Monday ( December 6 ) , there should be no human faces on Facebook , but an invasion of memories . This is a campaign to stop violence against children 
anyone else see that hold on < PROPFIRST > the first play 
who would have thought that haloti ngata is a morman 
lol shoe flew off 
Screw omama vote Flacco ! 
I dont see us winning this game 
I blame the offensive coordinator 
that feels good 
I dont think im goin to sleep for a while after a game like that 
I can't believe its almost 2011 
< PROPMALE > Genco I heard you suck though ... 
It seems like everyone has had a shitty 2011 . 
< PROPFIRST > Rice needs to trademark that dance 
It's so heartbreaking to be a fan . No excuses or blame to put on anyone but ourselves . At least true Ravens fans can keep their heads up knowing we played a great game against a great team and we're not bandwagon fans . I'm sticking true with my team and can't wait for next year . Oh btw any Steelers fans that grew up in Maryland ..... FUCK YOU ! 
5 hours to make a giant snow dick ......... completely worth it 
Two words steelers fans : SUCK IT
