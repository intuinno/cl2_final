Kisses blown are kisses wasted . Kisses aren't kisses unless they're tasted . Kisses spread germs and germs are hated . But you can kiss me baby ... I'm vaccinated (; 
So , I read Twilight . A mormon mom writes a novel about your ' culture ' that becomes this world-wide teen phenomenon , and suddenly eveyone is all vampire-centric again and moping over the kid that died in < PROPMALE > Potter ( am I the only one amused at him having therefore been raised from the dead , so to speak ? ) . -Jonathon8

Take off your shoes and tell them you want to return it and when they say you didn't buy it there say , \Hm ... I thought the customer was always right ! \""
