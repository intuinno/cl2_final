I'm not quite sure how I feel about having my singing voice compared to < PROPFEMALE > Merman ( especially when the boyfriend makes the comparison ) . 

Best newly discovered unhealthy snack disguised as a healthy one : yogurt-covered raisins :D 
Wow , even in 1963 , < PROPFEMALE > Merman was ranting about the \half-wit morons up in Sacramento\ " ( just watch It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World ) " 
Going through everyone's status messages from last night ... yeah , so maybe I didn't do anything sexy or fun but I was at an event so >:P 
MMmmmmmm Trader Joes tart frozen yogurt ... makes a mouth VERY happeh !! :D 
Just to be clear : Life is just a bowl of RAINIER cherries . :D 
32 days til the State Fair ! You better believe I have a count down going !! 
Amadeus is quite possibly the most perfectly made movie * ever * ... director's cut bits add even more to the perfection . 
Devising ways to oust the old tenant out of * my * new place . Not too happy that he's choosing to take another week to move out . >:P 
How did a non-coffee drinker like me end up hooked on cappuccinos ? 
This hair-brainedness needs to cease ... NOW . :P 
Any one have any clue as to what the new novelty fried fair food is going to be this year ??? What was at the OC county fair ? I'm plotting my plan of attack at the State Fair ... ;) 
Going to have to severely restrain my impulse to gallop around the State Fair , squealing at the top of my lungs with glee . :D 
Already sleepy time again ... I blame lunch from Bread Store . 
Nothing personal against you all as a species , ants , but mi casa es just not su casa . 
Missed the < PROPMALE > and smacked into a couple of the trees while I was at it too . :P 
Perhaps I'm easily amused , but some government acronyms amuse me tremendously ... newest one : TIGGER ( Transportation Investments in Greenhouse Gas and Energy Reduction ) 
Okay Bears ... Channel that anger and use it to cream the competition next week . 
Allergy season for < PROPFEMALE > is commencing ... * hack*hack*hack * :P I'm not contagious , promise ! 
Pipe dream for the day : Being a Wagnerian soprano . I can shriek but not in tune . :P 
Not so sure about those icicle lights , especially here in California . They definitely don't jive on Spanish-style homes . 
Stupid PC ... seriously asking to get chucked out the window . But in the spirit of the season , it shall be spared . 
First there was TIGER ; then TIGGER ; and now LUST . The alphabet soup of federal bureaucrats never ceases to amuse me . And how ironic LUST stands for so-not-sexy \Leaking Underground Storage Tanks \"." 
Does it count as a new years resolutiion to resolve to watch every episode of a TV series ? 
Cold weather , lack of sunshine and fog all breed pestilence ... Everything seems to be taking a quick swing at me too -- never taking up residence ( knock on wood ) , but slowly trying to knock me out with a few quick jabs and sucker punches . 
I <3 < PROPMALE > Price . Total sucker for the macabre . 
* face palm * X-| 
Thank goodness for the unconditional love of animals . 
Happy Oceans Day !! 
Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive !!! Eliminate the negative energy , people -- it kills !

A colleague recognized that the lolcat on my computer background was referencing Dune ... she is now that much cooler in my eyes . :-) 
I <3 my new French press at work ... downing even more tea than usual . :) And who says French press pots are only for coffee ?? 
It's a little thing but there's so much pleasure that comes with so many compliments being directed towards my $10 pair of shoes . :-) 
Oh my ! It's < PROPFIRST > Takei's birthday !! In his honor , remove your shirt and dash through the corridors : http://j.mp/bU4k7c 
To the death fight between < PROPFIRST > Bauer , Captain < PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > ... who'd win ? I'm pulling for < PROPMALE > . 
Leaving the crust of a pizza uneaten is sacrilege and just downright WRONG 
Add < PROPFIRST > Burr ( aka < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ) to the list of actors I'll absolutely glue myself to the television screen over ... joins the likes of < PROPFIRST > Spader , < PROPMALE > Rickman and < PROPFIRST > MacLachlan . :D 
Who eats sushi with a fork ?! Honestly ! 
In the ongoing game of \Guess What < PROPFEMALE > Is\ " ... today's guess : Italian . I look exactly like a guy's cousin apparently . " 
One of these days , I'll actually have a game of Scrabble where I don't draw only vowels . :-P 
Already tried to pour tea into my cereal this morning ... not a good sign . 
Dude , Sacramento ... where's my absentee ballot ? It'll be easier for the both of us if it lands in my mailbox by Friday . 
Can always count on my mum to watch those old , more obscure classics with me that no one else will . 
Is it just me or does it seem like a huge disproportionate number of SUV drivers ( particularly of Expeditions ) are horrendous parkers ?? 
Seriously , is it just me or does the Sex in the City 2 trailer clips make anyone else think of < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > of the Desert ? 
Silly Hamilton Burger ... why do you always seem to think you'll get the better of < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ? 
I live on the West Coast dang it ... what's up with all this humidity ?!? 
Forget the cake ... wedding has a HUGE pile of Rainier cherries ! :D 
FIRST DAY OF SUMMER ! Sadly the days slowly start getting shorter now . :( 
Going to do some more research into President Medvedev . I was very impressed ! 
Never ceased to be amazed/amused by the various methods people use to try to get fruit off one of the Capitol's orange trees . :-) 
Bookstores with a cat are just that much more superior . :-D 
Here's an idea postal service : Have extra staff around when customers come most , aka lunch hour and after 5 . Stagger your lunch breaks , for example . >:-| By jove , I might have just stumbled upon something to keep you from constantly losing money ... :-P 
How one small , short-haired kitteh can shed so much I shall never know . 
Death by ravioli ... I suppose there are worse things . :D 
Sign you may be on the verge of being * too * anal : wanting to call/message a TV station to let them know their CA Supreme Court group photo is out of date ( had < PROPFEMALE > Rogers Brown in it ) . :p . Am I redeemed by the fact that I didn't actually do it ??? 
To all you AAAAAAAAHmond folks out there , I heard < PROPMALE > Brown say ALL-monds on Good Eats last night . I think that settles it ... he trumps you . ;-P 
How high on the Dork-o-meter is strapping your potted orchid into your car with a seat belt ??? 
You know it's cold in the office when your nose is already starting to run . :-P 
Note to Chicago : I'm from California , not Minnesota . I have higher expectations when it comes to dining -- adjust restaurant recommendations accordingly . So no , I don't want a steak & potatos place or the Cheesecake Factory . 
Don't like lines at the airport ? Then travel on Sept . 11th . :-P 
I live in California dammit ... selling sub-par produce in the supermarket should be a crime ! You're on notice Safeway ! >:-| 
Harrumph ... Humidity BE GONE !! I live in California darnit ! 
< PROPMALE > props to Speaker Perez for saying \Go Bears ! \ " when he saw my Cal sign in my office as he walked by . " 
I should wear my funky tights more often ... I make lots of random friends and start more utterly random conversations as a result . :) 
Booya ! I just voted . >:-) 
Was told I walk in heels like they were tennis shoes ... I can dig it . :-D 
How is it even possible for someone who uses the term \wee weed up\ " to be considered viable presidential material ???! " 
This < PROPFEMALE > Day O'Connor/Ruth Bader Ginsberg lifelong groupie is having a serious geek out moment as she watches footage from the First Lady's Women's Conference . 
Just because I didn't vote for your candidate , doesn't mean I don't like you ... It's nothing personal ... PROMISE !! 
During the course of online Christmas shopping found a baby t-shirt that says , \Jonathan Swift Can Bite Me ! \ " BRILLIANT " 
Best gift that I have that keeps on giving is a lot of wonderful friends , family and loved ones ( corny I know ... but I like to think I get a pass today . :-) ) 
There's something wrong when the downtown Post Office has a stronger metal detector than the Capitol . 
Anyone remember what Day 10 of the \12 Days of Big 5\ " was ? \ 
Been using computers and blackberries so much that I've forgotten how badly I smear ink everywhere as a lefty . :-P . 
Happy Epiphany/Twelfth Day of Christmas/Wisemen Day ! :-) 
Second day on the job and I already break something ( whole handle to the side door of the office came off in my hand :P ) . D'oh! 
When transcription services go bad : What they said : \People from other countries\ " . What was transcribed : \ " Evil mother country . \"" 
Testing the limits as to how long one can live on solely Chex Mix ... :-P 
Typical reaction from everyone I see this week : \What are you doing here ? \ " . Said out of love I like to think ... :-) " 
Our budget may need some work as well as our business climate , but one look at the national weather map is a mighty big selling point for the < PROPFEMALE > State right now . 
Contemplating my huge stack of library books and debating what to read next ... nevermind that I have four other books I have yet to finish reading ... 
I'm a little surprised/disturbed ? /amused that during my search of Amazon.com for < PROPFIRST>'s Day gifts that a six-person beer < PROPFEMALE > appeared under the \Barware/tools\ " gift section . " 
Rainy weather makes bed seem oh-so-much better ! 
Made it out of the house early , so proud of myself ... and then as I'm taking my rainboots off , I realize I made it out of the house with two left shoes . :P 
< PROPMALE > Hope in < PROPFEMALE > ball at Oscars is just creeeeeeepy ... nice try to add some class but FAIL . 
Open a box of Girl Scout cookies and all bets are officially off . 
Hoping/dreading that someone is going to bring a < PROPMALE > Cake into the office .... Oooooo the frosting and the sugar sprinkles ... 
Maybe it makes me a bad person , but I was having a real hard time not asking why someone would bother buying and wearing the \butt toning\ " tennis shoes when they take the elevator to go up one floor . :-P "
