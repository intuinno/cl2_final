Before you spend , save . Before you assume , learn the facts . Before you judge , understand why . Before you hurt someone , feel . Before you hate , love . 
says if you were on a deserted island and you could only bring one item , how come people never say \a boat \"" 
If i told you something important and you said its not that important what i told you was important and it was important to me but not you would it be important 
i like it on the bed , i like it on the couch and sometimes on the floor 
all i feel right now is pain and i wish the numbness would come already :'( 
i think she knows whats going on now because she was crying so now she is sleeping in my room my poor puppy 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Pewett ? and i found out tht assume also means ass/u/me , ass of u and me , and to think a teacher told us tht :)

who am i in your life ? 
Sometimes i am so confused , and all i want is to talk to you . But afraid of what would happen and what you would say . I want the truth but i also don't .. 
me muero por explicarte lo que pasa por mi mente , me muero por intrigarte , y seguir siendo capaz de sorprenderte , sentir cada día ese flechazo < PROPMALE > verte que más dará lo que digan que más dará lo que piensen si estoy loca es cosa mía y ahora vuelvo a mirar el mundo a mi favor vuelvo a ver brillar la < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST >
