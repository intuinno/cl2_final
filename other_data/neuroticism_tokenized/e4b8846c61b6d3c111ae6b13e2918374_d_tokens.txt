It was worth the wait :) School today , not looking forward to it ! I'm still sleepy , but I don't wanna be so laaaazy .

Life's a trippp . 
I'm done holding grudges ... I just wanna be friends with everyone again , like back in the day . Things were a lot of fun then ... I had no worries ! 
Okay . It's time to lay down with Mr. Marley ! Goodnight :) 
The road of life is < PROPMALE > and you may stumble too ... So why are you pointing fingers when someone else is judging you ? 
Finally finished some bullshit word search .. Bore me to the point of exhaustion . Maybe a little nap wouldn't be so bad .. :) 
Swimming time ! :D

Gymmin it up !!! :) Yes , you can use gym as a verb . lol 
TGIF :D 
Going out to dinnerrr :) 
Just ate sooo much food , feel like I'ma explode ! 
I seriously hate math >.< 
They all do sorta the same thing . They rearrange what you thought was real , and they remind you the beauty of very simple things . You forget because you're so busy going from A to Z that there's 24 letters in between . 
I'm making browniessss :) 
Going to Millerton to get on a muthafuckin boat :D 
Sunburntttt :( 
You can pray and pray for my downfall ... When I rise like the sun , I ain't fuckin with ya'all . I'ma keep on keepin on , keep on holdin on . 
Today has been such a boring and lazy day . :( 
There is nothing you can see that is not a flower ; there is nothing you can think that is not the < PROPFEMALE > . 
I'm down like the economy . Hahaha . Fuckin rappers . 
I'ma clean my room then my nigga < PROPFIRST > is coming overrrr :D I haven't seen him in for-fucking-everrr ! 
When our minds are clouded by hatred , selfishness , jealousy , and anger , we lose not only control but also our judgment . 
I hate DVD players sometimes .

Back from camping :) Had an amazing week , but I miss the coast already ! 
Getting off the comp . Text me , I'm wide awake & bored ! 
I just have sooooo much energyyyyyyyy ! fhaklsfhasdksagajsfafs 
The anger sharks are swimming in my headddd . 
It's hot outside , let me go swimmin ' in your eyes :) 
Please come back home :( 
I'm so bored ... What's going on tonight ? 
Falafel . 
I play fetch with my cat ... Is that normal ? 
I hate Fresno .. Why isn't there more to do here ?! Time to get super baked and clean my room :) 
Today's been quite a boring day , but after I eat I think I'm gonna get some reading done :) 
Think of our life in nature , -- daily to be shown matter , to come in contact with it , -- rocks , trees , wind on our cheeks ! the solid earth ! the common sense ! Contact ! Contact ! WHO are we ? WHERE are we ? 
JAGUAR ?!?! 
Let me tell you about heartache and the loss of god . Wandering , wandering in the hopeless night . Out here in the perimeter there are no stars ... Out here we is stoned ... Immaculate . 
That's what real love amounts to - letting a person be \ 
what he really is . Most people love you for who you pretend to be . To \ 
keep their love , you keep pretending , performing . You get to love your \ 
pretence . It's true , we're locked in an image , an act . 
When you make your peace with authority , you become \ 
authority . 
I'm bored and wide awake ! Somebody talk to meee :) 
Expose yourself to your deepest fear ; after that , fear\ 
has no power , and the fear of freedom shrinks and vanishes . You are \ 
free . 
What have they done to the earth ? What have they done to our fair sister ? Ravaged and plundered and ripped her and bit her .. Stuck her with knives in the side of the < PROPFEMALE > and tied her with fences and dragged her down .. 
Where the party at ? 
Oh yes , I'm fine . Everything's just wonderful . I'm having the time of my life . 
If you want to know yourself you must face your deamons and bring light into the darkest corners of your soul . 
Hibernation mode . 
You'll never see a nigga as clean as The < PROPMALE > . 
I'm the make it happen cap'n . 
I got the skill to make your dreams real , ya feel ? 
Fuck Mondays . 
95% of teens wouldcry if they saw that < PROPFIRST > Bieber at the top of a skyscraper about tojump . Copy and paste this if you are part of the 5% that would sitthere with popcorn and a camera and yell \DO A BARREL ROLL \"" 
I'm not trippin , I'm too legit to quit and I'm squeaky clean pimpin . 
I'm stilll drunkkk . 
is feeling Tupacish . 
Bored . 
People need to start cheering the fuck up and being happy with what life has given them . NO MORE NEGATIVE THOUGHTS , BITCHES !!! 
I'm so sick of hearing about religion . 
Don't worry , be happy ! 
How I Met Your Mother can help improve even the most boring nights :) Goodnight , world ! 
Oh and by the way , I have never felt happier or more lucky in my life :) Things are just perfect ! 
Weeeeekend :) 
I need a fucking car . 
The only people for me are the mad ones , the ones who are mad to live , mad to talk , mad to be saved , desirous of everything at the same time ; the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing , but burn , burn , burn like fabulous yellow < PROPMALE > candles exploding like spiders across the stars . 
Never hurtin ' and that's for certain . 
Why do we never get an answer when we're knocking at the door ? With a thousand million questions about hate and death and war . ' Cause when we stop and look around there is nothing that we need in a world of persecution that is burning in its greed . 
I do my thing , and you do your thing . I am not in this world to live up to your expectations , and you are not in this world to live up to mine . You are you , and I am I , and if by < PROPMALE > we find each other , it's beautiful . 
School sucks , man >.< But when I get home today , I'm gonna make a bunch of popcorn and watch all the episodes of Planet Earth :D 
We've got this gift of love , but love is like a precious plant . You can't just accept it and leave it in the cupboard or just think it's going to get on by itself . You've got to keep watering it . You've got to really look after it and nurture it . 
From dehumanization to arms production to hasten this nation towards its destruction . Power is power , the law of the land . Those living for death will die by their own hand . Life's no ordeal if you come to terms , reject the system dictating the norms . From dehumanization to arms production to hasten this nation towards its destruction . It's your choice : peace or annihilation . 
A few minutes ago every tree was excited , bowing to \ 
the roaring storm , waving , swirling , tossing their branches in glorious \ 
enthusiasm like worship . But though to the outer ear these trees are now\ 
silent , their songs never cease . 
TGIF :D :D :D 
Going to the zoo with my mom , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPMALE > , and < PROPFIRST > :) Free all you can eat ice cream ! 
I'm just beginning to see ... The trees are drawing me near and I've got to find out why . 
I just had the strangest dream ... 
Here's some things that you must understand ... When I do it , I do it big ; that shit you're talkin ' is water under the bridge . 
I love finding weed in my bed :) 
Party and bullshit . 
BORED . I wanna get out of this house and do something funnnn ! 
When I get sad , I quit being sad , and be awesome instead ... True story ! 
I prefer to see with closed eyes . 
You ain't never met a motherfucker quite like me :) 
I'm so glad I have my beautiful < PROPFEMALE > back :) I'ma go smoke that shitttt ! 
Fuckin ' Mondays ... 
BLAH . 
The weather is perfect this time of day :) 
I am a traveler of both time and space , to be where I have been . 
I cleaned my room yesterday and it's STILL clean :D anddd I'ma keep it that way ! 
Gonna find something to munch on and go to sleeeeep . Sweet dreams , FB ! 
TGIF ;D - Gonna do some quick cleaning before the fun stuff beginsss :) 
I am gay . 
Omgggg . Craving fast food ... Somebody bring me some In n Out ! 
Good morning , world :) It's my birfffffdayyyy !!!! :D and I have to go to schoool today >.< 
Thanks so much for all the birthday wishes , everyone ! :) I had a wonderful day and I hope all of you did as well <3 
I want it to rain todayyy :) It's so fucking beautiful out right now . Winter be here already ! 
I'm disappointed that it didn't rain today :( 
Do you believe in what you see ? Motionlessly , nothing is real ... Wasting my time in the waiting line . Do you believe in what you see ? 
Finally finished with all the bullshit of today ... At least until I have to go to school ! :) 
Weedless :( 
Today has been quite the boring day , I disapprove ... :| Gonna eat some dinnner and work on my homework . Fun stufff ... 
Thissss is definitely the most beautiful part of the day :) I wish I could drink coffee ! :( Sounds so delicious right now . 
I would not feel so alone , everybody musttt get stoneddd ! ;) School time , yay . 
I wanna fly like an eagle to the sea .. Fly like an eagle , let my spirit < PROPFEMALE > me .. I want to fly like an eagle till I'm free , right through the revolution . 
It's been quite an uneventful day , but I suppose that's okay ... Time to get my grub on and then hopefully get keyed out of my mind ^_^ 
I will never be afraid again . I will keep on fighting till the end . I can walk on water , I can fly . I will keep on fighting till I die . 
I like how I always wake up at 5 in the morning and can't go back to sleep >.< 
Okay , either I'm going insane or I hear someone playing bagpipes ? 
We don't deserve this planet ... We're destroying everything and most people couldn't care less . I just do not understand . 
I want In N Out ! I still need to clean but I really don't want to :| 
Boats and birds <3 
Don't worry about a thing , cause every little thing is gonna be alright !!! Gotta stay optimistic :) 
I can't wait for my surpriseeee ! :D My boyfriend's the greatesttt <3 
Are there any female superheroes with blue hair ? 
I like good pussy and I like good trees .. Smoke so much weed you wouldn't believe and I get more ass than a toilet seat . 
In the process of dyeing my hair blue and green :D I'm so exciteddd , can't wait till it's done ! Then I get to see my babyyy <3 :) ! 
Just go with the flow :) ! We'll float on alright <3 . 
I absolutely love who I am & what I do , and I am never going to change for anyone :) 
There's some crazy thunderstorms going on right now :) I fucking love ittttt ! 
You can't decipher reflections from reality but neither can I ... 
Cause you're the only song I want to hear ... a < PROPFEMALE > softly soaring through my atmosphere . 
Nicest weather that Fresno has had in monthsss ... I'm excited cause I'm wearing cozy winter clothes ! :D I love this shit , man . 
I got a lot of compliments on my hair at Manchester mall :) 
Cause lately I've been tired and uninspired ... I've been tired , oh so tired . 
Pardon me while I burst into flames ... I've had enough of the world and its people's mindless games . 
Cause all we wanna do is party and bullshit ! :) 
DRUNK ! LOVIN IT ! 
Smokin ' blunts was a daily routine since 13 . 
Life's a bitch and then you die . 
HOME ALONE AND BORED :( Anyone wanna come chillll ? 
Be an Optimist Prime ! Not a Negatron ... 
Time to clean my room before going to < PROPFIRST>'s ! :) 
Expect the worst but hope for the best . 
Look on the bright side of life :) 
I got a bunch of free weed yesterdayyy so yay for having a wake n bake bowl ! :D I love Fridaysss . 
I love my crazy , dysfunctional family :) ... for the most part ;) 
I'm so stoned that I almost just spelled bite like bight , hahaha . 
Facebook drama is nothing more than entertainment to most of us . 
I wish I had a car and an amazing , outrageously loud sound system so I could cruise around Fresno bumping Legalize It by < PROPFIRST > Tosh :) Whaddup ?! 
I don't understand why people decide to be rude and give me a dirty look when I smile at them out in public . Seriously wtfff ? 
According to my grandma I've been smoking weed since the 3rd grade , lmfao !!! Hilarious . 
That 70s Show + the ganja = A happy < PROPFEMALE > :) BUT I'd be happier if my < PROPFIRST > were here too ! lol 
My Snuggie & < PROPFIRST > Cane make me prettty happy too <3 :) ! 
I witnessed beautiful , strong people making an important change to better their future today . It was amazing ! I wish I could spread love & happiness to everyone 
Things to do today : Make hot chocolate , cuddle next to the fire :) Sounds like a nice rainy day ! I wish I had rainboots , I wanna go on a walk ! lol 
All that we are is the result of what we have thought . If a man speaks or acts with an evil thought , pain follows him . If a man speaks or acts with a pure thought , happiness follows him , like a shadow that never leaves him . ~ Buddha 
Had a wonderful day alll day with my baby <3 Thanksgiving tomorrow , gonna get SUPERRRR baked all day & get my grub on , fuck yessss ! :D 
I need about tree fiddy . 
I wish everyone has a delicious & delightful Thanksgiving :) 
Holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else ; you are the one who gets burned . 
There is no fire like passion , no crime like hatred , no sorrow like separation , no sickness like hunger , and no joy like the joy of freedom . 
It's unfortunate how many people stay in relationships that they are truly not happy with ... Some people need to realize they are not going to find their fucking soul mate when they are so young , others need to realize that they are strong , wonderful individuals who would be so much happier without the everyday stress and everyday pain they have to deal with . 
If you don't drink or drugs , what do you do for fun ? 
Bitches love smiley faces ... :) 
Finally went to the doctor and found out I have seasonal asthma , so now I have a couple inhalers . Awesome ... 
About to eat some tacossss ^_^ 
I woke up feeling like I want to cry and I don't even know why ... Fuckin PMS ! >.< 
Work it harder , make it better , do it faster , makes us stronger ! Gettin ' shit done and feelin ' great about it :) 
I got my nose pierced today :) ! 
I just really don't like today . 
ALRIGHT , ALRIGHT , ALRIGHT ! Fuck these negative thoughts ! I'm gonna grub on some delicious Taco Bellll & be happy with Faith Johnston today :D 
Bass Lake today :) 
We tend to forget that happiness doesn't come as a result of getting something we don't have , but rather of recognizing & appreciating what we do have . 
Just ignite the light and let it shine <3 ! 
Warning : Don't EVER let life pass you by . 
IF YOU WANNA DO THIS NUMBER THING , SEND ME A NUMBER QUICK BECAUSE I'M NOT GONNA BE DOING IT FOR LONG !!!! 
#3 - Even though we haven't really < PROPMALE > out yet , I can tell we're going to become good friends . We already have so much to talk about and you seem so incredibly friendly . I'm glad we started talking and I can't wait until we get to < PROPFEMALE > out , and I hope we get to soon ! :) You are beautiful ! 
#420 ( first ) - We've known each other since I was in elementary school and you've c < PROPFEMALE > ed so much since then , but I think it's definitely for the best . You're an amazing person and you seem to try to do everything you can for friends you truly care about - I really like that about you . I enjoy whenever we < PROPFEMALE > out and I think we need to < PROPFEMALE > out much more often <3 
13 - You have been in my life from before I can remember . We used to do the stupidest things but we would always have so much fun . You were the first person I ever experienced crazy shit with and I will never forget all that we went through . I wish we were still as close as we used to be , you were one of the few girls who was actually a true friend . I love you so much , always have & always will <3 I can't deny it ! 
420 ( second ) - Ever since the second I saw you I thought you were absolutely gorgeous , and you can speak a sexy foreign language . I'm lucky to know you and have you in my life because you're absolutely amazing ! You're so fun to be around and I'm always there for you whenever you need some cheering up or some smoking out ;) I love you ! 
251 - I honestly didn't think you would message me for this , but we used to be much closer than we are now and I don't know why that is . You're a great person and a lot of fun to be around ! You really know how to get the party going when needed , but you also have your feet on the ground and are a successful person . I'm glad to have met you , even if we hardly ever talk . 
718 - I wanted to meet you since the first time I saw you on Facebook . You are absolutely gorgeous ! I was so happy to meet you when I did and I like hanging out with you but I'm still kinda shy around you . I wanna get to know you better because you seem like an amazing person ! We should get drunk together sometime , it seems like the easiest and best way ;) Stay awesome , stay beautiful <3 
8 - You are so much fun to be around and I knew you would be from the second I saw you ! You seem to always have an optimistic outlook and I like that because not many people do . I don't think you should take shit from your mom like you do , but I probably don't know the full situation so I probably have no room to talk . ANYWAY , you seem fuckin ' awesome & I'd like to get to know you better and party with you sometime . 
354 - You are an amazing person . I remember we used to be the closest of friends and I don't know what happened but we stopped talking :( I know we'll always have each other's back though and I hope we can have a < PROPMALE > to become the great friends we used to be again , because I miss talking to you & having you in my life . Your son is beautiful , I know you're an excellent mommy :) I miss you so much <3 
12 - You're a pretty awesome guy . I wouldn't have my iPod if it weren't for you . We haven't < PROPMALE > out or talked in a really long time but I still think you're a pretty cool guy . I hope everything in life is going just swell for you ; < PROPFEMALE > may be out to get you , but I know you're a good person so I hope everything works out for the best . 
69 - You're a cool guy . We don't talk as much as we used to since I'm no longer at Buchanan and that kinda saddens me . You were always a great person to < PROPFEMALE > out with at lunch and just talk about music and random shit . You were also always there in the mornings when I was way too baked to talk , hahah . I miss seeing you at school everyday . I hope everything's going well for you . 
1414 - We were never very close but you were never an asshole to me so we're cool . We don't talk at alllllll since I'm not at Buchanan anymore and I think we should change that because I like having lots of friends :) 
14 - You are such a beautiful person , inside and out . I hear a lot of people talk shit about you and it disappoints me because I know they don't even really know you . You're really fun to < PROPFEMALE > out with and I miss you a lot . We should talk more , because we could be good friends again . I love you ! I hope you're happier than you were the last time we spoke <3 
OKAY DONE WITH THE STUPID NUMBER SHIT , I've showed enough love <3 
I have a strange feeling that I am NOT going to like today ... but I'll still try to make the best of it . 
I wanna get my doctor appointment overwith so I can go cudddddle with my baby :) <3 HAPPY FRIDAY ! 
Cross joint timeee :) 
It has been a crazy fuckin ' weekend , man . I <3 my boyfrannnn :D 
Let us be grateful to people who make us happy , they are the charming gardeners who make our souls < PROPFEMALE > <3 Enjoying an unbelievably delicious omlette before getting ready for my day . Although it's grey and cloudy outside , the sun is constantly shining in my mind . LIFE IS GOOD ! 
Each morning I open my eyes and say to myself : I , not events , have the power to make me happy or unhappy today . I can choose which it shall be . Yesterday is dead , tomorrow hasn't arrived yet . I have just one day , today , and I'm going to be happy in it . 
Happiness cannot be traveled to , owned , earned , worn , or consumed . Happiness is the spiritual experience of living every moment with love , grace , and gratitude . 
Those who can laugh without cause have either found the true meaning of happiness or have gone stark raving mad ... I think I'm somewhere in between :P 
If there were in the world today any large number of people who desired their own happiness more than they desired the unhappiness of others , we could have a paradise in a few years . 
Happy Christmas to everyone <3 I hope everyone's day is filled with joy . 
and every time the < PROPFEMALE > shines , I become alive . 
Oh today should be a WONDERFUL day :D !!! 
You need to learn to be happy by nature , because you'll seldom have the < PROPMALE > to be happy by circumstance . 
Fuck mainstream , fuck the norm , and fuck conformity . 
Don't rely on someone else for your happiness and self worth . Only you can be responsible for that . If you can't love and respect yourself - no one else will be able to make that happen . Accept who you are - completely ; the good and the bad - and make changes as YOU see fit - not because you think someone else wants you to be different . 
It's time like these I need relief . Please show me how , please show me how to get by . 
The reason people find it so hard to be happy is that they always see the past better than it was , the present worse than it is , and the future less resolved than it will be ... 
Strawberrry weeeeeed cupcakes , mmmm :) 
Don't wait until everything is just right . It will never be perfect . There will always be challenges , obstacles and less than perfect conditions . So what . Get started now . With each step you take , you will grow stronger and stronger , more and more skilled , more and more self-confident and more and more successful . 
New zodiac sign dates ? Trippin ' me the fuck out . I'm staying a Virgo , I don't give a fuck . 
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks . 
Happiness comes from spiritual wealth , not material wealth ... Happiness comes from giving , not getting . If we try hard to bring happiness to others , we cannot stop it from coming to us also . To get joy , we must give it , and to keep joy , we must scatter it . 
I was thinking to myself , \This could be Heaven or this could be Hell . \"" 
Far away in the sunshine are my highest aspirations . I may not reach them , but I can look up and see their beauty , believe in them , and try to follow where they lead . 
I hate < PROPFIRST > Shackelford >:( 
There are some days when I think I'm going to die from an overdose of satisfaction ! 
Optimist : Person who travels on nothing from nowhere to happiness ... aka < PROPFEMALE > Hamner ;) People need to realize that Americans don't have real problems so they make up shit to be upset about so they have something to bitch about and I'M FUCKING SICK OF IT ! Goddamn , just be fucking happy , IT'S SERIOUSLY NOT THAT HARD ! 
People should have more important things to say rather than documenting every single thought you have . GET A LIFE , KIDS ! 
You have brains in your head . \ 
You have feet in your shoes . \ 
You can steer yourself in any direction you choose . \ 
You're own your own . \ 
And you know what you know . \ 
You are the guy who'll choose where to go . 
In response to those who say to stop dreaming and face reality , I say keep dreaming and make reality . 
You've got a lot of choices . If getting out of bed in the morning is a chore and you're not smiling on a regular basis , try another choice . 
Success isn't a result of spontaneous combustion ... You must set yourself on fire ! 
Don't take my kindness as a weakness , you fake ass bitches can't fuck with me . 
As long as I'm alive I'ma live illegal . 
I missss my boyfriend already ! This big bed of mine gets so lonely without him to cuddle with ... Oh well , at least I have Mr. Marley here by my side all the time :) Goodnight , FB ! It's been a wonderful Friday . 
I'm cooler than that cheetah from the commercials . 
Don’t do drugs because if you do drugs you’ll go to prison , and drugs are really expensive in prison .... Time to take a toke or two and watch < PROPFIRST > & Silent < PROPMALE > Strike Back ! BY THE WAY , my boyfriend is amazing :) GOODNIGHT ! 
It really puzzles me to see marijuana connected with narcotics dope and all that stuff ... It is a thousand times better than whiskey ; it is an assistant and a friend . 
If you want your dreams to come true , the first thing you must do is WAKE UP ! 
The road of life is < PROPMALE > and you may stumble too ... So why are you pointing fingers when someone els is judging you ? COULD YOU BE LOVED ? 
HANGOVERS SUCK !!! :( Why am I awake ? Going back to sleep .... after getting MEDICATED ! 
Today was too boring and too uneventful : 
GYM TIME :) Gonna start going more often , I needa lose my holiday weight !

Reggae music puts my soul at ease <3 Thank goodness for this beautiful weather ; I was going to go insane if there was another 24-hour period of rain ! 
Rainbow Country - a country where all races can live together in unity as one , forming the most beautiful country in existence ... I hope one day Rainbow Country will be Earth . 
Love songs from the 60s bring me sunshine even on gloomy days like this :) 
You have to deal with the thunderstorm to see the rainbow <3 
LOVE is my religion ! 
So I've decided that I like blunts .... but only when they're the size of a cigar :) 
Life is one big road with lots of signs .... So when you're riding through the ruts , don't complicate your mind . Flee from hate , mischief , and jealousy . Don't bury your thoughts , put your vision to reality . Wake Up and Live ! 
Hoping for the best ... :/ 
Cause all my life I've been waiting for , I've been praying for the people to say that we don't wanna fight no more , there will be no more wars and our children will play ... One day ! 
I'm seriously convinced I belong in a different generation . People my age these days are so DUMB ! 
It doesn't matter if you're black or white , the only color that really matters is green ;) 
I wish my boyfriend was here to cuddle ... My cat just isn't cutting it as a cuddle < PROPMALE > anymore , he's too much of a damn flea bag ! :( They're eating me aliveeee ! 
My agenda for the day : Most importantly FOOOD , shower , cleaning a bit , laundry , gym ? I really wanna do something I've never done before , but I don't think that's happening today . Life is WAY too short to keep the \same shit - different day\ " routine ! I need to WAKE UP & LIVE ! " 
but I ain't too pretty to slap a hoe so all you girls acting shitty bettaaa hit the back door ! 
8:40 - double the fun ;) ! 
Lucky there's a family guy ! Lucky there's a man who'll positively tell you all the things that make us laugh & cry ! 
Being with you is like being somewhere over the rainbow <3 :) 
I'm over Facebook ... People are so fucking lame ... It's kinda sad that Americans spend more time on FB than doing anything else . 
Lions are expected to go extinct in 9 years ... Can you imagine Africa without lions ? :( 
FB is probably going to end up being my entertainment for the day ... 
Some kinda wonderfulll <33333 
Happy Friday , guys ! :) Hope everyone has a wonderful Spring Break ! 
GYM TIME :) Gotta get back in the cycle , wanna look hotttt when it's swimtime :) 
Damn youza sexy bitch ;) 
Here's the situation , been to every nation and nobody's ever made me feel the way you do <3 .... Slow start to the day , but it can only get bettter from here ! :) 
Time to relax with Mary-Jane and some music until it's time for school ! :) 
I hate the thoughts that come to me when I stay up so late ... What is wrong with meeeeee ? :|
