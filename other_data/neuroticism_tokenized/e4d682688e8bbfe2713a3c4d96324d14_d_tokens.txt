Tired from waking up so early for the parade . Awesome , blood just squirted on my arm when I squeezed my finger . Maybe I should start putting pressure on them after I poke ' em . 
Uh oh , blood sugar above 600 ... 
Sledding was fun . Too bad every time i try to do any activity outside my blood sugar plummets .

I'm exhausted . Gonna try to get some sleep tonight . I feel like i've i had an off day . And if i offended any of you cause i kinda ignored you when i went around in 3rd block today , i wasn't trying to be rude . I was just supposed to keep conversation to a minimum so we could finish and get back to class at the time we were supposed to . 
Someone tell me which famous person i look like so i can make it my pic . 
people actually noticed it was my birthday this year :) thanks to all of you who wished me a happy birthday 
The c-130 flight was sweet . Only one kid puked , i was kinda expecting a chain reaction . 
Hah , I'm a fan of 579 things . 
When are the NHS service hours due ? 
Military ball was alright . Of course my table started talking about abortion ( one of the subjects we weren't supposed to talk about ) and how it was wrong . I bit my tongue and chose not to argue with them for the sake of polite company . At least the food was good . 
It seems like most of the classes i want for next year are on S4 . Arena scheduling sucks . 
Ignore that < PROPFEMALE > request from me , the < PROPFEMALE > tricked me into it ... 
Misses < PROPFEMALE > already . This is gonna be a long ass summer . 
Finally got to Ohio . Something like 65% of the population is obese and its disgusting . Can't wait to get back ! 
I miss < PROPFEMALE > . Waiting for her to get online . sooooo booorrrreedddd 
I just found a cat skull :D this one is going in my room ! 
So < PROPFEMALE > and I decided that we're opening a Chick-Fil-A that's open on Sundays when we're older 
Tired of my family getting sick . It always happens at the worst time and ruins plans that we've had for weeks . 
Great day with < PROPFEMALE > :)

Well , I figured she would pull this kinda shit , so i had my family < PROPFEMALE > around < PROPFEMALE > and I just so I had witnesses . So , if you don't believe me , contact my siblings or ask me for my parents ' contact info . As of right now , I'll be dropping this whole thing . But if you have any questions , just send me a message and I'll be glad to answer . 
So as most of you know by now , I broke up with < PROPFEMALE > today .

I didn't cheat on her . < PROPFEMALE > and I < PROPMALE > out as friends , nothing more , and I made that clear to both her and < PROPFEMALE > when we got together .

Dear people of Facebook , \ 
Please stop updating you status 3 times a day . Honestly , none of us care that much . That is what Twitter is for . \ 
Sincerely , Rian 
Threats over facebook aren't very intimidating . If you don't have the balls to tell the person face to face , don't bother making the threat at all . 
Anyone from ROTC know where which Petsmart we're supposed to go to tomorrow ?

Hint name is rain and I work at a button factory 
Ugh . I'm sick of seeing people give their change to bums and druggies that are begging for cash along the road . They're in their current situation because of past choices they've made . Let them suffer the consequences of their actions , even if those are starvation or death . Give your money to some worthy cause instead such as the Humane Society or finding a cure for cancer . 
Who else agrees that children should be confiscated from teen moms ? They clearly aren't capable of raising a child in a functional environment ... 
\So they cheated on they're last significant other and you didn't think they'd cheat on you too ?! Are you stupid ?? Get a clue ! \ " - < PROPFIRST > Dawson " 
Why does everybody want Burger < PROPMALE > at 9:00 pm ? 
Well , I was just paid to pretty much sit around , play games , and watch < PROPFIRST > Cottontail at work for 5 hours . 
W00t , accepted into the UCCS honors program . 1K scholarship renewable yearly ! 
Dear people who take forever , don't know what you want , don't specify which size or drink you want for 5 different meals , make massive orders because youre too lazy to go inside , or are rude who use drive-thrus . \ 
We hate you . \ 
Sincerely , all fast food employees .
