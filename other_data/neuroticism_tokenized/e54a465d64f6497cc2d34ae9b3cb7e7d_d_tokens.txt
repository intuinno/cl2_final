It recently became apparent to me that the letters ' T'\ 
and ' G ' are far too close together on a keyboard . This is why I'll \ 
never be ending an e-mail with the phrase \Regards\ " ever again . "

God our week would be : Sinday , Mournday , Tearsday , Wasteday , Thirstday , \ 
Fightday , Shatterday . Seven days without God makes one weak !

Almost Halloween .... muahahahaha .... 
wishes he could find his phone amidst the chaos that is his room . 
? 
There is nothing funny about Halloween . This sarcastic festival \ 
reflects , rather , an infernal demand for revenge by children on the \ 
adult world . 
I think someone hacked me 
How great the father's love for us , how vast beyond all measure . That he would give his only son , to make a wretch his treasure .. 
Prays that God will give him the strength and the courage to be the man he intended him to be . 
is sick and tired of teenagers , and dislikes being a teenager . 
Found my phone :D 
Feelin ' better :) This week is gonna be a good one ! 
Time to go assassinate some bad guys ....
