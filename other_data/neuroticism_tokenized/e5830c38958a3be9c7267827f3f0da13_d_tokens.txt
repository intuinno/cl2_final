Looking for a home for 2 adorable kittens ;) The girl is hopeful going to her new home as soon as the arrangements are made . However , her brother a beautiful silver tabby doesn't have a family yet if anyone knows someone who would like a sweet kitten who is only a few months old let me know ! Thanks ;) 

Found a wonderful home for the two kittens ;) 
Happy New Year !!! 
Be careful driving tonite ;) The roads are slick & some of the freeways were pretty slow when I was driving to work this evening 
Finally Im just about finished with my research paper ! I think I kind of over did it with all the research materials I think I checked out just about every book pertaining to the subject at several libraries I really dont think I needed over 30 books for my paper & I wont even start on how many journal and internet articles I collected 
I can't wait for Adobe CS5 to come out ! Only a little longer until it should be out . It's anticipated to be out May 3rd . I'll finally be able to do everything on my computer at home . Thanks Mom & < PROPMALE > for the awesome computer ! 
Is it a scam to con people into believing they're saving money when in reality they raise the price just to lower the price ? Kroger's is doing exactly this .... so I will be boycotting Kroger's for this and numerous other reasons . 
Finally after searching through all of my papers & checking every single jump drive I own I found my Resume :) Now I just have to retype it & drop it into my resume template that I designed last quarter 
Going back to watching < PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland I dont have to work until 5pm ;) 
Yum ! Cant wait to eat this chicken tetrazzini with < PROPFIRST > when he gets home from work 
This will be really good ! Im such a good cook ;) 
In memory of every\ 
cancer patient , family member , and friend who has lost their battle\ 
with cancer and those who continue to conquer it ! Put this up for\ 
1-hour if you know someone who has or had cancer . Many won't copy and\ 
paste . I did . Will you ? Love to those who are in the fight ... may you\ 
... win every round !! 
Sweet my < PROPFEMALE > flowers are starting to bloom ;) 
Why would anyone want a 5ft tall < PROPFEMALE > machine in the living room !!! 
Its probably a good thing I don't know what plant or tree I'm alergic to because if I did they would be EXTINCT in a 50 mile radius around my house !!! 
Think I'm going to have a bonfire in the woods tonite ;) Autumn is here & yet it didn't feel like fall at all today 92 degrees outside this afternoon not that I'm complaining its just strange ............. 
Well if I cant get < PROPFIRST > to wake up & help me start a fire I guess I'll just do it myself ... hope the coyotes play nice otherwise I'll end up a tasty treat ! Nah I'm pretty fast ... 
I quit smoking today hopefully it lasts more than a week this time ! 
Poor little < PROPFEMALE > why did you have to dash in front of my car ? :'( I wish I could've stopped in time .... at least its the first animal or bird I've ever hit with my car . 
just great the computer lab has been commendered for a microsoft word workshop ... really ! then i was told 2 use another lab ! 
Tough\ 
girls come from NY . Sweet girls come from Louisiana . Prissy girls come \ 
from California . BUT OHIO GIRLS have fire and ice in our blood . We can \ 
ride dirt bikes , be a < PROPFEMALE > , throw left hooks , pack heat , bake a \ 
cake , love with a passion , and if we have an opinion , you're going to \ 
... hear it !! Re-post if you're an Ohio Girl !!! ? ? ? 
Is it possible for JumpDrives to eat files ??? I know I worked on my a project at school for hours & saved it more than once yet its as if it never existed ;( Whats wierder is some of the images I used for it are gone to ... It was perfect I don't even have the heart to try to fix it again ............ 
Blah ! I'm so sick of winter already !!! I hate this cold :( I'm opting for no more winter who's with me ? 
1 final project completed only 2 more to go ;)

The only class I need to graduate was cancelled for next quarter & its only offered winter quarter there isnt an online version of it I can take . I already emailed the student advisor for the graphics department last week & no response still ;( Anyone have any ideas ??? 
Wow I never realize how good thyme & < PROPMALE > were in scrambled eggs ! Thanks for the spices < PROPFEMALE > :) 
Can't wait to get my hair cut at < PROPMALE>'s next week just in time for my birthday :)

To all the Idiotic drivers out there : You guys are lucky I don't drive a Tesla Roadster or I would go Burnout 3 on all of you !! Mwahaha .... 
Today was hopefully a small victory for animals as I stood up for my views to a woman wearing a fur coat & wrote on a piece of paper , \Your coat is a tragedy & those animals died in the most horrible fashion . It looked better on them ! \ " My heart is still pounding !!! "
