is staying alive , because anyone can die . 

is one year closer to the grave , best make the best of what little time I have left . 
is filled with sunshine and rainbows because the light of the world fills him with hope for the future . :) 
Things are alright . Also < PROPFEMALE > does NOT have a \thing\ " about < PROPFEMALE > Roberts ! " 
If anyone wants to know about Malaysia ... I am now well informed . 
You don't take Economics of < PROPFEMALE > , It takes you , deep into its tangled web . I should know . I got trapped . I couldn't get out . I just keep looking at the clock going round and round . Tyranny and Time . 
Why is it when everything seems to be going fine that I am the most concerned/ worried about my future ? Lord in Heaven I wish I knew what I was going to do when I graduate . If you can't tell I'm feeling very \positive\ " right now . By the way it just occured to me that I am complaining about my life to the internet . Guess I just became \ " that guy . \"" 
Studying for my final test EVER !!! And then I am to leave college never to return . feelings = mixed 
Work held a few surprises . none of them good . Not in a good mood . This is evidenced by the fact that I am posting on facebook . wow ... I really must be upset . 
The world is millions of times better than it was two hours ago . I've finished my first lesson plan ever . It is better than perfect ... it is done . Now I will chill with a beer listening to Anamanaguchi's Jetpack Blues . Everything is good .
