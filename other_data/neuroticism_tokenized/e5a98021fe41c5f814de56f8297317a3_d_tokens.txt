is looking forward to the mini Birt Get-Together tomorrow ! 
hopes TJ has fun shooting < PROPFIRST > Kluwe with paintballs - for real !

has a very sweet , patient daughter who has been waiting all night for her turn on the computer and hardly buggin ' me at all ... Thanks for your < PROPFEMALE > , Camarie ! 
ATTENTION BIRTS ! Please visit the Birt Family Reunion 2010 < PROPFEMALE > ! There are new postings on the Discussion Board , and you can leave comments , post new ideas , ask questions , etc . See you there ! 
can't wait until < PROPFIRST > , Jack-Jack , and < PROPMALE > get here !! And Manillian ! And my TJ is coming home !!! ( Emo and Bre will be here , too ... * yawn *) 
hopes Camarie < PROPFEMALE > Malyn has the house open and fans running so its not hot and stuffy in there when I get home ... 
can't wait to watch True Blood tonight !! 
feels like she's living in a disturbing alternative universe with < PROPFIRST > Favre playing for the Vikings and Vikes fans cheering FOR him ... :-( 
Somebody taped a \Cash for Clunkers\ " ad on my Dad's < PROPMALE > ! LOL " 
and TJ saw Inglourious Basterds today ! 
Camarie is back in school only 3 days and she brings home a cold - and of course shares it with me ! 
is finally ( hopefully ) starting to get over her sinus infection and horrible , hacking cough . 
Happy Anniversary < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > ! 
Saw some great performances at Harbor City International School this evening ! 
LOVED Zombieland ! 
is in St. < PROPFIRST > to do lunch with TJ before the game ! :-) 
My Camarie has The Flu . :-( 
is off to learn with Rabbi < PROPFEMALE > . Yah ! 
Happy Hanukkah ! 
TJ was accepted and offered a full scholarship at < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Law School ! 
Happy to finally be home from Fargo , but already miss my Drewblet and JackJack ! 
So , the dude at the liquor store accepted my gray hair in lieu of a photo ID ... 
Can anybody recommend a reasonably-priced snow/ice plower/shoveler in the Duluth area ?? 
Happy 2011 , Y'all! Lots of good things gonna happen this year ...! :-) 
has a grandkitty who likes to play fetch ! 
What's the most addictive substance ? Whatever it is , they must be putting it in Mountain Dew these days ... 
is kicking Mountain Dew cold turkey . ( Wish they had a patch or something tho . ) 
is sooooo thirsty ... 
< PROPMALE > is at the Vikings-Cowboys game . So is TJ !! 
is thinking I might be in the mood to watch some Inglourious Basterds tonight - might cheer me up . 
Suckered in AGAIN ! 30+ years of disappointment continues . Grrrr ... 
is over her initial negative reaction . Some die hard fans I know are able to focus on the good things that happened this season and move on , and that's a good way to look at it I think . 
is planning on going shopping with Camarie today after my meeting with Rabbi < PROPFEMALE > . Hope the car starts !

' s niece , < PROPFIRST > , is coming to visit ! Yaaayyy ! That means < PROPFIRST>'s dad will also be here ... Oh , well . It makes my mother happy . lol 
is patiently awaiting the vote . Feeling less nervous about it , seeing people stepping up and doing the right thing . Will never understand how hard-working people support politicians whose sole purpose seems to ensure the < PROPMALE > get < PROPMALE > er and can so easily ignore the suffering of others . Looking forward to some more evidence there is finally some justice and fairness in this country after all we've been through . 
TJ will be graduating from University of St. < PROPFIRST > in May - Magna Cum Laude ! Congrats , T ! I'm so proud of you ! 
has issues . 
Speaking of love ... Today is my parents ' 40th Wedding Anniversary ! Happy Anniversary , Mom and Dad ! I'm a proud and happy daughter . :-) 
Help ! I'm surrounded by Animeniacs and Animefreaks ! 
So , my dad fell down 3 weeks ago and he's still not much better . His pain is NOT managed on 20 mg of OxyContin plus he's all woozy and sick to his stomach . I know he's 76 , but it seems after 3 weeks and narcotics , there should be SOME pain relief and healing ! Very frustrating ! >:-( 
We're admitting my dad to St. < PROPMALE>'s today as an inpatient to get the pain management and diagnostic testing and care he needs . His primary will not follow him at this hospital , but I believe he will get much better care there . Hopefully , now , he is on his way to some substantial recovery . 
Thanks everyone who has asked about Dad ! Basically , we are starting to see some improvements and healing , but it is taking some time . He has started physical therapy with a really nice therapist and has been using a TENS unit that's been helpful . His new doc has weaned him off the OxyContin , thankfully . 
is going to Fargo tomorrow for my nephew's birthday party ! Planning on taking lots of pics ! 
Today I will see my son graduate from college . Despite many hurdles and challenges , he has worked hard and achieved outstanding goals . Today is a proud day for a Momma ! 
Happy Pride to my Twin Cities FBFs ! 
Negativity . Just gotta let it go ... 
90 degrees here in Lakeside today . 
Happy Independence Y'all! 
has not even BEGUN to procrastinate ...! 
Just said good-bye to my kids ! I sent them to Fargo as an Anniversary present to my brother and his wife - hee-hee ! 
Just had a nice visit with my cousins , < PROPFEMALE > Birt Balser and < PROPFEMALE > Birt Wight , and lots of fun with my crazy little cousins , < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > and little < PROPFEMALE > ! Can't wait for the Birt Family Reunion 2011 to see ALL my cousins !! :-) 
One week left with my Tj Cohen before he leaves for law school in Washington , DC . My heart is starting to break just thinking about it . 
is liking the good news from California ! And all the Prop 8 Victory posts on my wall - literally ! ;-) 
I haven't done Tj Cohen's laundry in many years , but I did tonight and found a total of $11 ! ( jackpot , yeah ! ) 
went to lunch with Tj Cohen today , then saw Inception . Great movie , and always happy to < PROPFEMALE > out with my TJ ! :-) 
Today is the last day of Tj Cohen being home . Tomorrow I bring him down to The Cities to meet up with my brother , and then Tuesday he is on a plane to Washington DC , to law school , to his dream . I still don't know how I'm ever gonna be able to say goodbye to my little boy or what I'm going to do with him so far away from us ... 
Tj Cohen landed safe and sound in Washington , DC . My dorky bro is with him and all is ok , just waiting to get into his new apartment . I miss you so much already TJ !! But am thankful you got there safe . 
So , like , some program is saying I answered questions about lots of certain people about an hour ago - and I didn't . What's up with that ?? 
True Blood and < PROPFIRST > tonight ; Weeds premier and < PROPMALE > tomorrow ! Yay , can't wait ! :-) 
Happy Pride Everyone !!! Pride Fest at Bayfront today , Parade in Sup-Town tomorrow .

' s Baby Girl starts her senior year of high school tomorrow ! 
Rosh Hashanah begins this evening . I haven't been to < PROPFEMALE > since before Rabbi < PROPFEMALE > left . The new Rabbi is a dude , think I'll go tonight and check him out . New year , new beginnings , embracing change , and all that . ;-) 
Went to < PROPFEMALE > tonight , Rosh HaShanah service was nice - had very talented musicians and singers and choir , and I LIKE the new Rabbi ! Good way to start the new year . :-) 
My mom has made me laugh , wiped my tears , hugged me tight , watched me succeed , seen me fall , cheered me on , kept me going strong , and drove me crazy !! Moms are a promise from God that you will have a best friend forever ! Put this on your status if you love your mom , whether she's here with you , or in Heaven .

Go Vikings ! Hope they don't disappoint the devoted fans ( like my cousin < PROPMALE > ) who are braving the snowy , freezing stadium to see them ! But , disappointment pretty much goes with being a Vikes fan , so we'll see ...
