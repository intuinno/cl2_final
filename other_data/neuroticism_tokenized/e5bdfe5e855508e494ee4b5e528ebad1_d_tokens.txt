So according to a dirty hippy on facebook , I am fat . What should I do with this information ? Any thoughts ?

Our greatest < PROPFEMALE > is not in never falling , but in rising every time we fall . -Confucius

Ya know consumer < PROPFEMALE > could save a lot of money by not even installing a turn signal , since 3/4 of < PROPFEMALE > doesn't use these devices . Although I know it is extremely difficult to operate a turn signal . ( Yes , I have a little bit of road rage ! )

Life is continually trying to bring me down in the form of people , places or things . I refuse to fall . I am tired of simply trying to keep my head barely above the surface . Get out of my way world !! A tornado is a brewing !!! 
You learn to like someone when you find out what makes \ 
them laugh , \ 
but you can never truly love someone until you find out \ 
what makes them cry . 
When it rains it most definitely pours ..... 
deep breaths ...... no throwing of inanimate objects ........ or people . 
loves and misses her Lyra . 
wonders what life will throw at her next , because this time she is going to throw something back !

I have the choice of being constantly active and happy or introspectively passive and sad . Or I can go mad by ricocheting in between . 
I am inhabited by a cry . \ 
Nightly it flaps out\ 
Looking , with its hooks , for something to love . \ 
I am terrified by this dark thing\ 
That sleeps in me ;\ 
All day I feel its soft , feathery turnings , its malignity . 
The holidays seem to have a way of making my melancholy existence even more incompetent ...... I just wonder if there is a way to make it back to everything . 
had a good weekend . And hopes of many more .
