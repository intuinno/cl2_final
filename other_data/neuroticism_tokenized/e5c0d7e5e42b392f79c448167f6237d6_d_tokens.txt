Is it possible to be in the mood for absolutely nothing in the world ? Because I just discovered that feeling . 
kinda wants to go to the ER but they're just gonna pump me full of Saline and Waiting Rooms . ( P.S. Welcome to the world Lillianna . ) 
Sitting . Waiting . Feeling . Seething . Emotion . 
First song of the year on the bus : Entombment of a Machine by Job For A Cowboy . Win . 
\life is not all about knowing how many licks it takes to get to the center of a tootsie pop\ " - < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Krutz " 
hopes you have a boss day . :) 
Now that I think about it , my weakness just may be my strength ... 
And i don't want the world to see me , cause i don't think that they'd understand . When everything's made to be broken , i just want you to know who i am . 
In a book you're the dullest pages , empty words and vernacular blurs . 
You gotta do the cookin ' by the book . 
- it's only a matter of time ... 
Continuance . 
I don't have time for quitters . Sink or swim . 
Every . Little . Thing . 
Nobody said it was easy . 
our Journal ... <3 
Just finished my biblical , mythological , and folk allusion sheet . I learned A LOT . And that took FOREVER . 
Friday ;) 
With my loves < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > . <3 
Up late . Txt me . I bet I miss you . 
We spend our whole lives falling for someone else . No wonder we all end up flat on our faces , unable to catch who's been falling for us . 
Every word ; hollow , intuitive . Feeling but stagnant , seeing that which lacks qualities like a phoenix . 
Wipe from your eyes euphoria ; reveal phantasmagoria . 
This is how I'll remember you . You don't want that . 
I need new music . What song makes you think of me ? 
Done . 
Yeah , it plays black and white for me too ... 
Homegrown , ayyyy . Happy Birthday < PROPFIRST > ! 
Me + You = ayyyy ;) <3 
I wanna go for a walk . 
Let me be the one who calls you baby all the time . 
WANNA GO TO THE MALL TODAY ? 
Times like this ... gonna shake my head and make a sandwich . Champ . 
I'm losing my mind . 
Much madness is divinest sense . 
If only you could see my words ... maybe then you would know . 
About to play MW2 on PS3 hit me up with your ID ! 
Some days you just don't like yourself , and that makes it difficult to like others . 
i.h.a.t.e.y.o.u. 
How do you expect to hear my voice when I can't even hear it ? 
I like the sound of my own footsteps . It lets me know i exist . 
Gonna regret this ... Like for \Truth Is ... \"" 
77/78 truths later , and it's done . No more . I would like to thank everyone who gave me a method in which to write , and write positively and for a good cause . I hope you enjoyed the compliments and positivity , it's the least I could do , for you are the people who constitute my life . Every little thing makes a difference , and I hope , for at least a minute of 78 lives , I gave you a smile . 
Team breakfast , Yu-Gi-Oh , and Philly later for the Over 9000 race . :) 
A man is only as good as what he loves . 
I don't care what you say , ' Seize the Day ' was an amazing book . 
True brothers can high five in the dark . <3 < PROPFIRST > . 
I can't even escape it in my dreams . When it's physical it's real . When it's metaphysical ; it's more than that . 
An object in motion tends to stay in motion unless acted upon by an outside force . Scientists had it all wrong , < PROPMALE > was talking about love . 
Storms like these make me wanna just cuddle up . <3 
Middletown Invitational ... get some . 
If I knew all the magic words , I'd be the wizard to cast your dreams . 
Buffalo Wild Wings with < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > Holden , < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , and < PROPMALE > Iacona . Jealous ? Better be . :P 
Breakfast with the lovely < PROPFEMALE > June . :) 
I think I may have found the college of my dreams . St. < PROPFIRST>'s College <3 
Once again , I have redefined my own boundaries . Hello < PROPFIRST > Penn Marching Colonials , I will be your narrative voice . :) 
I'm done screaming now . I feel a little better . 
I used to be able to forget it all , at least for a day . Now my leisure is just another weight on my back . I'd fix it all if I could . I've never prayed for rain . 
misses you , badly . :// 
Today is another footstep of a monotonous march towards the means of nothing . 
WPFH SHUT-OUT 5-0 !! HYPE NIGHT ON MAIN STREET !!! 
If the University of Maine Farmington wants 10-12 pages of fiction , non-fiction , and poetry ; they're gonna get it . 
Time can only be outweighed with synergy . If you don't have time ; make it yours . I will be 18 years old tomorrow ; 18 years I made for myself . 
For my birthday , I got the complete poems of < PROPFEMALE > Dickinson . Best birthday hug goes to < PROPFEMALE > Poppe . And I got one call at midnight from < PROPFEMALE > Bechard . Tomorrow is a surprise with < PROPFEMALE > Winters . Good birthday . <3 Thanks for all the wall posts ! 
To remember is up to the brain ; to forget is up to the heart . 
Me : I really don't like girls . \\nAndrew : Yeah me either . I kinda like this sweater though . 
I don't like it on my Facebook . 
Mall with Albiona , < PROPFIRST > , and < PROPFIRST > . :D Yay for alliterations ! 
These college applications never end . 
This feels good . 
If I could walk a day in your shoes , I'd take them off and walk into oncoming traffic . No one likes your shoes anyway . 
wants someone to come cuddle with him for his nap . :( 
I think if just ONE thing went right , that'd be great . 
Did anyone else wake up because of the explosion sound ? 
Many will hear . Few will listen . Even less will take action . Excuses are weaknesses . 
Not sure if I should pay $15 to be the punch bowl creep for homecoming . 
Hmm ... not sure how this analysis of my own poetry will go tomorrow ... 
TWO WORDS : Old < PROPMALE > 
The 5th Horseman of the Apocalypse goes by the name of < PROPFIRST > McDonald . 
In the Blue Rock's locker room listening to Suicide Silence on an exercise bike . FTW 
Business Professionals of < PROPFEMALE > Fall Leadership Conference & Leadership Summit October 18-19 , at the Sheraton Hotel in Dover . 
More business . Such is life , yet , I am enjoying it . Middle Level Fall Conference tomorrow ! :) 
I used to think I was special , until I found out I wasn't . Go figure . 
is on the verge of passing out . 
Leave it up to Turcu to smash all of my dreams and then set them even higher . 
Anybody got a really good < PROPFEMALE > System i can borrow ? You'd make A LOT of people happy . 
Winning streak !!!! WOOOO . I am a CHAMP . ;) 
I quit . 
Drop it like it's hot . 
Some days , you just have to listen to Drop It Like Its Hot . Today is one of those days . 
I'm living today . Not yesterday , not tomorrow . I know my passions , and I know my goals . If you don't; I could care less . ( In short , \I'm doin ' me . \")" 
According to the SAT I'm a bad writer . According to a certain someone I'm a bad runner . According to others I'm a bad leader . According to my grades I'm plain stupid . Can I get anything right , please ? 
The Lord giveth ; the Lord taketh away . ( and thank God for it ) 
Why can't I find a woman who will enjoy Chopin with me and discuss literature ? Dang . 
No-shave November . 
Wistful . The gentle ballad of silence . 
I just realized that when he called me a bohemian , that was kind of awesome . 
I feel like my life is the antagonist of lucidity . 
I'm a broken record . Ooh , won't you let me play my song for you ? 
Count the blessings , not the hours . 
Free Poppe . <3 
just wants to write . 
Me + Frédéric Chopin = Work getting DONE . 
Late Night < PROPFIRST > to the rescue ! 
Me + < PROPFIRST > + Black Ops = ZOMBIES ONLINE . WE GO IN , WE KILLLLL . 
I want your heart to sink when mine does . I want you to cry as I start to break down . I tried to be the stronger one , but I never lied to you . I can't do this . I just can't . Where did I go wrong ? 
1 Application , 1 Scene of a Drama , 1 Short-response , and 14 pages of writing portfolio later ; University of Maine Farmington , here I come . :P 
This weekend brings the end of so many things ... Yet , I'm ready to start something new . <3 
THEY HAVE SNARE DRUMS AND BAGPIPES :O 
You don't anything about yourself until you learn the sound of your own heartbeat . 
It's almost 4 a.m. Yes , I did apply to 9 colleges today . BOOM . Productivity . 
AHHH WP Indoor Programs ( Drumline , Visual Ensemble , Jazz Band ) Info Night TOMORROW ! SO HYPE . <3 
I'm simply running out of words . It's always too little or too much . How do you drown in nothing ? 
INDOOR MEETING . 6 . AUDITORIUM . BE THERE . 
IT'S JAR OF HEARTS 
You can sleep when you're dead . Too bad your bed is the fountain of youth . 
One of those days ... you try so hard but none of it seems to matter . None of it . 
Right now , my priorities include my name printed on a letter . I won't let you interfere with that . 
Man , I'm so full . But it might because all of the BS you've been spoon-feeding me . 
Going to the mall . Goooooooo . 
really wants someone to text him . 
Where are all the good princesses ? 
You make me WANT to leave . 
Is it so bad to want it ? To try for it ? :/ 
1234 - If my Bark sink/ ' Tis to another sea -/ Mortality's Ground Floor/ Is Immortality - ( < PROPFEMALE > Dickinson ) 
Sometimes , it feels like God punched your life in the face . 
Happy Thanksgiving everyone . I'm thankful for every moment spent with my awesome friends and all of the glorious opportunities given to me . 
Hello comatose . 
I'm definitely not thankful for this crap . 
Today seems like a good day to wallow in this enervating state of lassitude and vexation . 
How does this Skype thing work ? Someone Skype me and < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . 
I LOVE <3 Lars Jensen <3 MUCH MORE THAN STUPID < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Fawra DOES . 
I'm sitting at dinner with my family . And we're getting along . WHAT IS THIS BLASPHEMY ?! 
Four hours into this day and I already have a headache from anger . 
' I don't believe in atheism . ' -Uncle < PROPFIRST > 
Fours hours into this day I wanted to die . Four hours left and I could just kiss God . 
Ever feel like you walked bare naked into a road and got hit by a car and you lay mangled on the concrete for everyone to see ? I feel that way right now . 
' Let me be the one who calls you baby all the time . ' 
Love her like the wind blows . You know when it's around , but you'll never know when it'll go away . 
Why can't you be the Borte to my Temudgin ? 
I'm broken . Fix me . 
' Am I holding you up , or are you holding me down ? ' 
Am I a hypocrite for not getting why you don't understand ? 
Change\ 
your Facebook profile picture to a cartoon from your childhood and \ 
invite your friends to do the same . Until Dec 6 , Monday , there should \ 
be no human faces on Facebook , but an invasion of memories . This is to \ 
condemn violence against children . 
Blame it on the thespians . 
Anybody wanna hit the mall later ? 
Words wrapped in regret , gifted to you . What do I know but mistakes ? 
Toured St. < PROPFIRST>'s today , got my first acceptance letter from < PROPMALE > , YAY . College-bound . <3 
Just when everything falls apart - God busts out the duck tape .

If every status I posted wasn't painfully and subliminally didactic , it wouldn't be me . 
This substitute's name is definitely Mrs. Lavery . Think about it . 
Receptionist at the eye-doctor's office knows Slipknot . Win . 
It's all fun and games until Butterflies turn into Dragons . 
DECEMBER DECIMATION . 
LIE TO MY ... FACEEEE 
Woke up ... more pain ... loud ringing sounds ... disoriented . 
Off to the mall , despite being crippled . 
\I'll tryyyyy I'm stronggggg I forgotttt Our songggggg\ " -Baby Preacher " 
Still can't wrap my mind around Grizzly Man . 
is dressed like an elf today ! ;D 
I want to keep hitting the fast forward button on my life . But then I wouldn't know where to press play again . I then I find myself wanting to hit rewind . 
- and I get so afraid , ya know ? Maybe I'm not really cut out for this . Half of love is just convenience these days . Hi , I'm < PROPFIRST > , and I'm in the wrong century . 
Tonight was a very awesome night . :)

And isn't but amongst the pages of a book where I find myself the most joyous . Each word strikes the chord of a serenade . 
No one can take me to the Charter-Penn match at all ? 
P.S. I got accepted into the University of Maine Farmington Honors Program for Creative Writing . <3 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Behringer's Mom : \7-10 inches huh ? \""

< PROPFEMALE > Christmas . <3 
\Dear < PROPFIRST > 
The only word that describes this headache : explosive . 
So . I turn on the weather channel . All I heard : \Shot in the head ... stabbed ... beaten ... shot in the back ... \ " Cool . All I wanted was the weather . Now I'm just depressed . " 
Accepted into Nazareth College . Okay , excitement over , time to play COD with < PROPFEMALE > . 
Next time you feel like your relationship sucks , watch a Lifetime movie . Whoooa < PROPFEMALE > . 
\You have to stand for something/ or you'll fall for anything \"" 
There's a car crash in my head . 
Gonna do what I always do when I feel like a failure ... sleep . 
If you got into a car accident and suffered from traumatic brain injuries , I would definitely still love you . 
NO SCHOOL FTW 
I just want to take this time to say thank you for making sure all my hard work is in vain and that I have no future . Have fun in the third circle . 
Ambivalence , my friend and foe ; we meet again with angst and sorrow . 
Singing Chop Suey ! with < PROPFEMALE > <333

Jumped in twice ... second time was for you . 
Today I feel ugly , tired , and a bit nauseated . But , to tell you the truth , I'm pretty freakin ' happy . :) 
\I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black . \"" 
I'll never know why , but restaurants innately fascinate me . Woo for Marketing Research !

Ooh Onion News , you are so brutal ... and so good . 
Updating live from the Troop 6 Prices Corner police station ... 
We're all drowning in ourselves , within a much more omniscient whirlpool . 
Stressed and depressed . Bad combo . Sleep now . 
Her teardrops fall with the snow but as they crash onto the sheets they < PROPFEMALE > louder than screams through the purgatory of my mind where I'm always waiting . 
< PROPMALE > Grey , classical music , and writing ? Heaven at last . 
Wow . I just snapped . I am a whole new person in a boardroom ... 
I want to go home , wherever that is . 
Home alone and crying is a bad combination . 
I never forgot yesterday , I'm just trying really hard to envision tomorrow . 
You can tell springtime is coming because everyone is holding hands . 
Anybody wanna do Zumba Dance Fitness with me tomorrow afterschool ? :) haha 
Today deserves to be pluvial . 
My sinuses are attacking my face . And it hurts . ://

Know what's really mature ? Adults talking about you behind your back . I can't even tell you to grow up , so have some respect and act your age , pal . 
Watching Spaceballs with the French kids ... right .
