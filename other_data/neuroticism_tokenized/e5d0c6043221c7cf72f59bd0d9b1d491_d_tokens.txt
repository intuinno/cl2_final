We are wishing every one a very Happy Thanksgiving ! Have a great day . 
When one door of happiness closes , another one opens , but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one that has been opened to us . \

The secret of happiness is this : Let your interests be as wide as possible , and let your reactions to the things and persons that interest you be as far as possible friendly rather that hostile . \

I grew up reciting this every morning in school . We no longer do that for ... fear ... of OFFENDING SOMEONE !! Let's see how many < PROPFEMALE > NS will re-post this & not care about offending someone ... 
At times , of course , we'll make mistakes . But God is always there to forgive our repentant hearts and help us back on track . 
Everyone experiences periods of difficulty in life . In such painful times , we may feel as though God is not blessing us . But even then , we are experiencing many of His amazing gifts , despite the fact that they might be escaping our notice . 
When I hear , I listen \
