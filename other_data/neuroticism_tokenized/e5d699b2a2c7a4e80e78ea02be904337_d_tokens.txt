Vegas ! Womenz eeeeverywheeeere !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And there's even ... ummm ... other stuff , maybe ..... 
Nostalgia is in itself bittersweet , the joyful remembrance of the past can bring sorrow by the realisation that those times will never exist again 
So I got banned from live today x3 it was for this : O (^_^)= D^o^) Donkey PWNCH !!!! 
< PROPFEMALE > Westenra has beautiful music , yes ? 
No matter what you people think , I say the Trans-Siberian Orchestra is made of win >:D 
Hard to find things to keep my mind occupied nowadays , everything has become quite uneventful . If only more than just that canvas could keep my interest , but at least all my friends make it bearable . After all you're suffering like I am >:D 
There's just something about those ridiculous 80's movies that makes them so enjoyable x3 
That was SO funny , I spent billions of dollars on a remote island and cloning a dinosaur , just so I could fall off of it ! 
Don't you just enjoy finding random Indie artists on the internets ? They're truly doing us service XD 
* Ahem * Despite < PROPMALE>'s cynicism , I believe < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim to be the best movie I've seen this side of the century . 
Yeah , if these ridiculous dreams are an onset of the side effects of this allergy medicine , you can count me out . Guess I'll just have to suffer through it all xP 
Yep , so .... School and stuff .... Awesome ? .... Sure ... Yes Indeed , I believe so , Now if the days didn't feel so blasted long . Then it would be perfect . 
I just thought of the best idea ever ! Finding where they buried all the E.T. Games !! 1 !!! 111 ! Could you imagine digging one up that still worked ?! Now all I need is an < PROPFIRST > Sessler and a < PROPFIRST > Webb ... And clothes from the set of a truly epic American film ... 
Ha ! Those online classes seem to be made for braindead monkehs . The only problem with it is those darn loading screens taking up my time xD 
Oh my , My physical well being is being threatened xD It's certainly been a long while , I can tell you that ^_^ 
Aside from my awesome fiasco , Huzzah ! Weekend's finally here . :D 
Buahaha , it's almost completed >:D

I ... ran out of black paint ... and Hobby Lobby's closed today ............... > _O Darn you Sunday ! 
Yes , finished ! Now I get to stay up all night doing homework ! By golly , you better be happy with it xD 
Stoopid lame teh photos day , All you were allowed to do was put your thumbs in your pockets ... That's cool ?! 
Hahahaha ! Go Urbandictionary ! ( thanks for the idear < PROPFEMALE > x3 ) McGlasson - A dirty whore who always thinks that people are trees and is a very annoying person . This person never stops talking . This person spits while he talks . This person is a real smacktart and likes TC . This person was minipulated by < PROPFEMALE > Good . Way to go McGlasson 
Indeed . 
Oh < PROPMALE > thar Mr. Sketchbook , Haven't seen you in a while . I think it's time for adventure :D 
Hohoho , sorry World . When these headphones go in , your shenanigans go out :D 
Herp derp derp ... Herp-a-derp /) 0_0 )/) 
Life has recently become extremely mundane it seems . So either something amazing's going to happen , or I'm horribly mistaken and we can all look forward to a bright and boring future :D 
Well well Mr. Yorke , it appears you shall be my first subject . I wonder if all this will change my understanding ... Oh well , time will tell . 
By far the best MAD skit ... Referencing Over 9000 , pokemon , AND Pedobear !!!

Hmm ... I might go punch a hole in a wall , frame it , and then sell it for a few thousand at a fine arts museum ... 
:D Yeah ! Thank goodnes for the rain . Tomorrow shall be a great day . 
Women ... 
1 in every 10 people is gay . That means 1 in every 10 people is \ 
instantly put down , given bad labels , left alone , put in a minority , and\ 
so much else ... all for something they didn't ask for . Many gay teens \ 
are turning to suicide as a way of escaping . If you want to tell them life will get better , and you respect them for who they are , copy and \ 
paste this . Most of you won't , but let's see the 5% who will . 
So I got this really awesome thing called a computer , and I think it might just be awesome . Just maybe . Maybe it's awesome . 
Grave of the Fireflies . Great Depressing Movie . 
So yeah ... Are you ready for this ? This is going to be so intense ... Haircut >:| Yeah , take that society .

Here's a doosy for all of you . Press shift 5 times in quick succession . When the menu appears press ' yes ' . Then proceed to have a nice day . 
Hmmmm .... Indeed So . 
I just don't know ... What do you think Sandwich ? 
Man ... Today I was violated by a large red object , it was wet too ... 
Yay , I finally get to acquire a canvas . 
In the name of all that is holy , WHY ?!?!?! 
So you are the first to fall , farewell , my friend . 
Well , that's officially the first time I've ever been in trouble for being courteous ... Oh wait . 
Hehe , snowy on the Blue < PROPFEMALE > . :D 
Aww , I'm a terrible parent . Furbaby keeps dieing D: > Ah well , you win some you lose some .

Quick : You and I wake up in jail together ... Using only FOUR words , what would you say to me ? NOTE : if you comment you have to copy and paste this in your status so I can comment on yours . If you're a stalker sasquatch . 
Looks like I have to live up to my family name and prepare for full-life consequences . 
Puddi ! Puddi everywhere !!!! 11 ! 
Why do I know what Howdy Doody is ? I've never even seen the thing ... 
#5282 ( aka only one I'll be doin ' ) Good thing we started talkin ' , you're quickly becoming one of my favorite people to talk to . Now all I have to do is get my thoughts organized enough to < PROPFEMALE > through with a conversation xD And it's always good to know another art-kin . :D 
Now that that silly nonsense is over ... 
Hmm , going to that < PROPMALE > exhibit didn't really accomplish anything . Oh well , at least I got to see some sleepy Kittehs , and Ol ' Snaggletooth . 
If everything could just be quiet for a few hours , I would be the happiest person in the world :P 
A good birthday ? Maybe it was . 
Whoops , just spammed the crud out of everyone . I really need to check \Do not publish feed story\ " more often ... " 
Well , that'd be the first time I've hit someone out of rage in ... 5 years ? 
Yeah ! New Graphics card ! Nerdtastic ! 
Maybe if I portray myself as an uninteresting and utterly boring person then people can leave me be . I mean ... Crazy weather ... Eh ? 
I'm starting to care about things ... This is not ... Natural ... 
Who knew I could have a conversation that long with someone . And it was fun too ... What have I become ?! 
Being in an artistic mood sucks :P Should you know what I mean . 
This is the first time in a long time I've nerded all over the place , so you're all going to deal with it . Dead Space 2 suckahs ! > : |And I'm going to go become mentally insane with Amnesia . 
It's a gerbil's world . 
I realized I haven't done any drawings with hands as the focal point for quite the long time . Looks like it's time for some srs bsns . 
Imagine this . 1 chat room , 4 conspiracy theorists , 1 cult follower ... And 1 < PROPFIRST > . Yeah , that's how intense it was . 
Perhaps it is good to know what items are used for before acquiring them . Just saying . 
Troll doc on News at 11 ? Me Gusta . Did I do it right guys ? 
Hmm ... Perhaps I should be more social ... Ehhhh , naaaah . 
It appears that when I'm in my morning CATS class I always seem to lose whatever writing utensils I happen to own at the time . Such a strange phenomenon . 
The great thing about being alone is that I'm just so darn good at it . 
What I did will never happen again in this world , I promise you . 
If Michio Kaku finds a way to reverse aging I demand he be the first young-old man in the world . 
Thanks to you people I'm gonna go watch All the Nameless episodes ... Again ... 
Hmm , my ailment is subsiding a < PROPMALE > . Guess you guys gots < PROPFEMALE > put up with me at school tomorrow :P 
You and I wake up in a psychiatric < PROPMALE > together . Using 4 words , what would you say to me ? Note : If you comment , you must copy and paste this to your status , so I may comment on yours as well .. Be a good sport and play along ... 4 words is harder than you think . 
I've had the thing for an hour now and just barely recognized why it's been laminated ... It's from a Library . My detective skillz are just THAT good . 
If I don't get my sleep I'm not an effective cocaine salesman :| 
They locked the door .... My < PROPMALE > was in there ! And Freshmen had that class next ... * Despair * 
No , really . As far as Indie music goes they truly are quite exceptional . 
Hahaha :D 
Snakebites ... That's right . Oh and I'm back , but nobody cares about that . 
Laughing and smiling ... So painful . 
Haha , and so I have finished every < PROPFEMALE > Zombies comic >:D 
Filled with so much doubt ... About everything . I sometimes wonder if I could spare myself my intelligence and cynicism for the mindless glib so many others have . Their lives are so simple . 
Farewell computer . It's been a great ... 6 months ...
