red 
you just took a helicopter out with a car ?!?! yeah well , I ran outta bullets . GOD I LOVE THAT MOVIE !! 
I think ninjas broke into my house and beat me in my sleep . I have no proof of this of course , they were NINJAS ... they leave behind no trace ! 
Why is abbreviation such a long word ? 
Our enemies are innovative and resourceful , and so are we . They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people , and neither do we . 
snow is nature's glitter .... I hate glitter .... it gets everywhere 
wishing I could get paid to just show up somewhere and sleep .... lol I need to find a good paying sleep study

ever think people don't listen to what you're saying .... just hearing whatever it is that they want to hear ? 
It's time to show the world that more of us support our troops then dont ! If you support our troops then please post this on your status and leave it there for one hour !! And if you don't stand behind our troops , then please feel free to stand in front of them !!! I SUPPORT OUR TROOPS !!!

I karate chopped a baseball bat in an elevator because that's how I roll . 
May your mother's cousin never be assaulted by Attila the Hun at the supermarket 
why is it , that just because someone is older than you .... they think they know more about your life and how to live it than you do ? even if the life they have led has nothing in common with your own . I like a 50 year old woman with no kids but close family , telling a teen mom with no one how she should live her life ..... 
ready for summer vacation ... lol I think I hate getting up more than my son does 
trying to balance work , sleep , school drop offs and pickups , spending time with my son , and still trying to have a life ..... what I end up with his being sleepy most of the time , and no life ... ha ha maybe I should stop trying so hard , and just see what happens 
Shame on you America : the only country where we have homeless without shelter , children going to bed without eating , elderly going without needed meds , and mentally ill without treatment - yet we have a benefit for the people of Haiti on 12 TV stations . 99% of people won't have the guts to copy and repost this . 
wish I could figure out how my son does half the things he does 
I feel like I'm stuck in a rut .... 
wishing it was spring ' 11 already :) 
caution : May be Habit forming 
will be debt free in under 48 hours !!! I love income taxes lol

credit cards paid off , car insurance paid for a year , life insurance paid for a year ..... only monthly bills now are rent , power , and phone ....... bought a new lab top , cell phone , new clothes for Draven .... and I'm not completely broke ..... I think I'm in a state of shock .. 
I am the poster child for wasted potential ... but I love the life I chosen

wondering how long it will be before I can bend my toe again lol 
plan for tomorrow , live for today

ugh , I'm gonna cry on payday ... but I'd rather keep my lit boy safe .... after ripping the side off my < PROPFIRST > when roads were soso ... NOT going out on them when they're bad 
Just finished watching The Time Traveler's Wife .... 
I LOVE MY MOM ! For all of you that aren't too proud to say thank you to your moms for helping you be the great person you are today ... please copy and paste to your profile ! I expect to see this many times on my < PROPFEMALE > ! Some people no longer have their Moms here to appreciate . ? ? ? I LOVE YOU MOM .... 
I still believe somethings are just meant to be .. 
if I had the money I would buy a vacation home somewhere in Hawaii and live there from Nov to April lol 
the safest way to double your money , is to fold it in half and place it in your pocket 
goodbye three day weekend .... hello not off for a week lol 
wishin I could stop time , catch my breathe , and dive into the future .... I've got so much big stuff comein up in the next few months ... not sure I'm ready for it all

There is no medicine like hope , no incentive so great , and no tonic so powerful as expectation of something better tomorrow 
*~*~*~* is daring to dream *~*~*~* 
wonder what the price of a \fresh start\ " is "

so , I manged to be off work without asking on my 2 month anniversary ( which is also st. pattys day ) ... However , me and my little boy are both sick .... sick enough that I've had to miss two days of work , and he's missing school ... :( maybe I can get my feller to take me to < PROPMALE > for some dayquil and tissues lol 
hopeing to get enough drugs into my system to go to work tomorrow . Money is not a want at this point it's a need . I don't think I can afford to loose another long shift . lol too bad I don't have the kind of job where they could just hide me and my coughin fits in the back lmao 
has slept off and on all day . Still running a fever , takein Dayquil .... thinkin I'll swith to tylenol , but cant quite remember what the recalls this year were on them 
A mother will sacrifice her own happiness in her life to ensure her children are well taken care of ! I would make every sacrifice in the world for my children , They come first ! They always have and always will ? Put this as your status if you're a devoted mom who will always put your children first !!!! ? ? ? ? 
well , I've got the next year of my life planned , now if I can just make up my mind about gatlinburg 
down to 8 mins of power left on my laptop . new charger should be here on or before the 6 ..... be back when I get it lol 
so lucky to be dateing my best friend , who happens to be a damn good man 
is dreading tuesday ... my son swears he's never going back to school ever . The bad thing is he's in headstart .... 14 more years before he'll be out of high school 
I hope Draven goes to school without too much fuss in the morning . Too sore and tired to fight much with him lol 
so Draven didn't go to school today .... he slept from about 7pm to 10pm ...... now I'm trying to get him back to sleep .... hopefully he will feel well enough to go to school in the morning . 
my < PROPFIRST > locked me in again .... yes \IN\ " ...... the locks go crazy ... you unlock them they lock back before you can get the door open .... had to hold the lock switch in place while it clicked and made other noises til I opened the door ..... which locked again as soon as I let go .... such fun to look like an insane person while trying to escape from your own car lmao " 
Life is too short to wake up with regrets . So love the people who treat you right . Forget about the ones who don't . Believe everything happens for a reason . If you get a second < PROPMALE > grab it with both hands . If it changes your life let it . Nobody said life would be easy , they just promised it would be worth it ! post o ... n your wall if you agree !! 
It's not easy being a mother . If it were easy , fathers would do it . ~ From The < PROPFEMALE > Girls 
so just got home from takeing Draven to the doctor again . This time he has a sinus infection , ear infection , and allergies ....... 
It takes 7 seconds for food to pass from mouth to stomach . A human hair can hold 3 kg . The length of the penis is three times the length of the thumb . The femur is as hard as concrete . A woman's heart beats faster than a man's . Women blink twice as much as men . We use 300 muscles just to keep our balance when we stand . The woman has read this entire text ..... the man is still looking at his thumb !!

ah ... the age of cell phones , beepers , networks , onstar , remote linkups ....... and yet ..... the good old fire siren is still used to wake up the whole town for everything ..... If ever there was an emergency that I needed to be warned of , ( such as a tornado or idk missle attack ) I'd just be cussin the fire department and putting my pillow over my head ..... 
Met him in ' 03 . Worked with him ' 06 . Became his friend somewhere inbetween . learned to confide in him in late ' 06 . Was my strength in ' 09 . Began dateing him in ' 10 ...... can't wait to see what future years will bring 
is dreading tomorrow , but knows my son will love it 
blessed

so very much to do in the next couple weeks ... 
is falling apart 
is thinking I may try my hand at writing again . I used to love writing short stories . I just don't know what I'd do with them if I did write them . Perhaps , noone would realize I didn't belong in class , if I just showed up at the high school one day . 
I think its good that I don't know where to buy one of those old-fashioned medical drills . I think I would try drillin a small hole into my forehead , just to get rid of this headache 
....... 
\I wish I liked anything as much as my kids like bubbles . \ " \ 
I don't have a dream guy . The kind that seems to good to be true . ( They normally are to good to be true btw ) I have a REAL man , who's not perfect , But REALLY loves me . Someone I can REALLY love , who I can REALLY trust ...... who I can REALLY know ... He's not some guy , trying to be the prefect guy . He is who he is , and I love him . He is REALLY the prefect guy for me . 
In memory of all babies born sleeping or whom we have carried , but never met , or held in our arms . Make this your profile status if you or someone you know has suffered the lossof a baby . The majority won't do it , because unlike cancer , baby loss is still a taboo subject . Break the silence . In Memory of all Angel Babies , gone too soon , but never forgotten ? 
it's really starting to set in that I'm moving ...... 
ugh .... Draven woke up at 2am .... super clingly .... I just wanna sleep ...... But he comes first :( now I get to listen to the gummi bear song over and over and over ........ 
why doesn't < PROPFIRST > just keep his doors locked ...... I mean , he lives in Chicago .... shouldn't he be locking them anyways ? 
_____/\\____________________\\O/_________ Help - shark . Stop staring and do something !!!

won't be online much for awhile :( 
made a rather shocking discovery .... I can wear my four year old son's socks . :( growing up way too quick on me

does this work ? 
It is said that everlasting friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question their friendship . These types of friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been or how far away they live . And , they don't hold grudges . They understand that life is busy , but you will always love them ...... Re-post if you have at least 1 of these friends . 
feeling stupid , just tried to change my name about ten times , before reading it can take 24 hours ha ha 
dial up is much faster at night .... I'm a night person to begin with .... gfashfowashfgoswahf ....... however must go to sleep or I won't get up to put Draven on the bus ..... fvaskjfswajfojsreaogfaslgoj ...... there should be grade school night school for people like me 
Just finished filing both federal and state taxes .... for FREE online ..... HA ! take that H&R Block !!! I don't need your state fee ! 
The varnish was so dark with age that the details could hardly be made out , but < PROPMALE > loved it instantly . 
does anyone know anything about The Schooner Inn at Va Beach ? 
This is going to be my first single V-day since idk about age 15 or so .... I have to say , I'm a little bitter ...... and may destroy your flowers if your dumb enough to ask me to smell them or whatever ..... 
Wish I could fast forward the next 3 weeks or so .....

is quickly becoming a Spore addict :) 
still has a stiff , sore , swollen , and bruised jaw . a week after having my wisdom teeth cut out . u know that stump remover stuff you put on tree stumps . and they go away . they need to make that for wisdom teeth . little bit of cream and just the unwanted wisdom tooth turns to liquid or something , and they just suck it out with a needle . Sounds much much better than them having to drill into my jaw bone to get it out 
has a serious case of fuckitallitist this morning ..... 
is thinking .... about thinking , about dating again 
watching the bumblebee flies away ..... again .... I dont know why , but I have to watch it every time its on 
Spore is overtaking my life ...... I must remember to save more often though , it seems to freeze my computer after I've played for about four hours without saving ... \ 
grrrrrrr 
I must say .... I'm feeling a bit special with all these bday wishes . Thanks everybody :) 
wants a man built like < PROPMALE > , with < PROPMALE>'s heart , < PROPFIRST>'s accent , < PROPFIRST>'s smarts , Angel's smile , and < PROPFIRST>'s personality ....... Thinks only disappoint with await me lmao
