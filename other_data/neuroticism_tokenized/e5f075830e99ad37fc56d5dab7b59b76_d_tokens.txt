is thinking about stuff . and listening to music 

sadly ur still not there ... 
has realized , i've lost a lot , bt i gained some too . i love those who i've gained , that i feel close to , and who i can maintain a friendship with . i know imma keep learning , losing , and gaining , friends along the way . just hoping i get through things well 
loves anime !!! especially the opening and endings of them . listening to inuyasha endings at the moment . =) 
so i had 4 teeth pulled out .... i'm in a load of pain right now , cuz the thing that numbed my mouth wore off and i'm kinda sad now cuz i want solid food !!! bt i'm not allowed to eat it . and i'm not even allowed to eat anything until 8:45 . i get soup . bleee 
is happy that i got to < PROPFEMALE > out with meine amiga < PROPFEMALE > !! and partially babysat my baby cousin < PROPMALE > 
got my schedule for school today . i dont ' want school to start up again . i'd prefer daydreaming all day listening to my music , and watching anime . oh well i'm screwed . going back next week . hope this year dnt suck 
hey um i know i don't normally ask this of u guys but can u pray for my family ? i'm not gonna tell u specifically wat we need prayer for but can u guys just pray for us plz ? 
so .. i got a hearbroken teenage boy on my hands who wants me to cheer him up ... he says i'm good with words ... in all honesty i don't c it . but i'm trying to work on cheering him up ... so yeah . wish me luck and pray for me if u want ... oh and still keep praying for my family too . 
u say that i look lonely , well a good amount of things aren't as they appear . i'm fine in my quietness with one friend . and wats the point of saying that if u really dnt mean it , cuz the way u acted a few minutes later didn't back up what u first said . hmmm oh gee that's a surprise . take a hint ma'am . 
yeah so today rocked . celebrated a birthday at fun works . drove a go kart for the first time , along with a bumper car . yeah < PROPMALE>'s gonna get it on tuesday . yeah just wait and see . haha . AMAZING DAY basically . 
so u wanna explain to me , y ur hating me for something that i didn't do ? learn to control ur jealousy and ur assumptions ! gosh , i haven't done sh ** to u and now ur choosing to be a pain again . dealing with u during summer was bad enough , i dnt wanna deal with u during school . gah !!! 
does anyone wanna help me out and cheer me up ? haha .. thanks for anyone who does .... 
i hate the fact that i contradict things within myself . amazing ... so history does repeat itself . i'm screwing myself up , just like i did back then . my heart/consciousness/unconsciousness aren't agreeing anymore . < PROPFEMALE > destroyed . great ... freaking great ... 
so now i regret that decision . better hope this doesn't repeat again . if it does , dannabit too many repeats !!! glah ! 
hey u guys wanna help me out . pray for my friend alright . he needs it ... and i think i need it too ... thanks . 
Retreat=amazing&i'm glad i went . some wounds were reopened&it reminded me of a time tht was difficult for me , i thank the ppl that caused this for showin up cuz they helped that wound open so tht it could b healed . my heart broke in a day and was healed that night . i'm grateful for tht . although the 3 i thanked didn't kno wat i was thanking them for , they accepted it&THANK YOU CORE . I LOVE YOU GUYS 
i lost it and then got it back . well slightly haha . amazing . eh hopes it's not that bad . 
today was alright , but i still wanna relive saturday that was amazing for some reason . 
i like talking to some people a lot i guess . they can make me happy but i get impatient waiting for them to reply . just throwing it out there haha 
i need to man up haha . i learned how i can be easily thrown around today , well i got reminded just by someone stronger than the other dude i went against . 
i'm still getting impatient waiting for ppl to reply , but i just kinda wish the person that brought me alotta joy wouldn't make me feel anxious without trying . 
impatient , anxious , and yeah .... i hate how people don't know how they can make me feel without them even doing anything . 
so today we're cleaning , dad's playing his christmas music , and we're getting ready for christmas ... yesterday i can honestly say was still the worst thanksgiving ever for me , but again good things were i saw Ninja Assassine(i liked it ) spent some time with my nieces and nephews , and had like 3 lil kids chasing after me trying to tickle me ? haha i guess those were the only good things ? 
dang ... it's not broken , just becoming slightly cracked ... gah . i really don't like anxiety , or disappointment . Thanks for doing that to me dude , unintentional as it may be , i still don't like you because of it . Hating this .... great . blah ! 
i don't wanna be here anymore ... i'm tired of anxiety ... this sucks .... 
so i feel stupid now = great(sarcasm ) , my eyes kinda hurt , and i still hate anxiety . i think i really gotta end this now . 
gaaaaaaah ... finals .... nooooooooooooooooooooooo !!! * hides under a rock in a cave behind a waterfall in a < PROPMALE > in a state in a country in a continent in a planet in a galaxy * 
i was grateful to forget about you for a minute(more like hours ) but now everythings coming back , and i feel like throwing a tantrum when things don't go the way i planned . 
this is an impatience . i want a gap to open before me escaping time so i can stay in there as long as i like . i wanna go to the mountains ... 
1/3/10 R.I.P. < PROPFEMALE > Garcia ... pray for her please .... 
feels like doing something fun tonight . but i can't do anything because i got to go teach a catechism class with my momma . plus i'm hoping to go out tomorrow night : homecoming basketball game(i guess ) hopefully . 
ingredients to become a unicorn : gel , hairspray , string , a clip , 2 bobbypins , a rubberband . 2 lollipop sticks , and toothpaste . WARNING : how u unbecome a unicorn is ur choice !!! 
so i'm losing my voice , and i got 2 presentations tomorrow . great right ? but besides that spending time with < PROPFEMALE > was pretty darn fun !!! 
so here i am again , asking you to pray to give my friend a miracle , so that he will want to stay . within these next two days , i ask anyone who reads this to pray for my friend < PROPFIRST > to make the right decision . 
Dnt u hate it < PROPFEMALE > there r certain ppl that u want to care about u , bt they really dnt care ? * Sigh * oh well . 
I hate repeats in life ! Anyone wana give me an explanation for repeated situations bt with different ppl ? 
Was i used or was that real ? Im tired of all this ... =/ 
gaaaaaaaaah fck everything . stupid people . 
Damn happiness why don't you stay anymore ? Laughs are nice , but why do you run away so easily once the laughs end ??? =/ 
Parents are using life/self esteem advice from Kung-fu Panda ... yeah ... kinda odd lol 
When you try to teach a white boy spanish .. yeah that's just funny in general lol . and no i'm not trying to be racist . \no translator\ " haha made me laugh . " 
I feel stupid ... gah wonderful . 
i'm tiiiired . too much sun makes me want to take a nap . decent day though . 
Thanks life for being such a < PROPFIRST > a ** . Gah 
why is it i have a tendency to ruin my peace of mind ?? =/ 
Well i started reading Captivating today , yeah it made me feel like a girl haha 
wooow , ur such a freaking jerk . ugh 
I think God is sending me a message , and it's something i didn't wanna do . dang it !!! 
While you SCREAM at your woman , there's a man wishing he could talk softly to her ear ... While you HUMILIATE , OFFEND and INSULT her , there's a man flirting with her and reminding her how wonderful she is . While you HURT your woman , there's a man wishing he could make love to her . While you make your woman CRY there's a man stealing smiles from her ... Post this on your wall if you're against Domestic Violence 
Accepting the unproven fact would be better than expecting the less likely answer . =[ 
let's see how today goes shall we ? i hope it goes better than the past few days . Good morning to anyone reading this by the way . 
what's the point of having to deal with stupid people ?! 
Honestly , if this is how it's going to be , then i don't really want this .. =/ 
well i'm stuck here , and i'm feeling kinda stupid for letting that show ... there may not be any comfort , and i don't like that i possibly started confrontation .... fuuuuudge . 
Im alright i guess , just tired . im thinking too much about nothing . 
Going out with the parents ? Today's been pretty calm . Friends got me thinking bout stuff left and right since yesterday though . My choice is the only one that counts though i guess . Great , serious talk needed once we get back to school ??? I believe so . 
Honestly i wish i could finally give up on this . Because i don't see the point in this staying around when it's causing me more annoyance instead of joy . =/ well good night . 
well today sucked really bad and not because it's the end of school . I'm in a FML kinda mood . great . anyone make me smile please ? 
F*ck my life . 
Today got better =] \do u remember the time we walked by here and we saw those two cats doing it \"" 
just got back from disneyland !!! 
Is nervous-ish . 
doesn't like anxiety .. 
is calmer than before . i jst finished reading Not As Crazy As I Seem , it was pretty nice to read it a 2nd time . 
one of the only interesting/good things about my day was when i was sticking my feet in the water that runs by the sidewalk . 
my mom and dad liked the chocolate chip cookies < PROPFEMALE > and i made at < PROPFEMALE>'s grandma's house !!! 
\love i honestly don't know what i can do for you .. \ " =/ " 
My visit to < PROPFEMALE>'s was filled with : cooking , swimming , degrassi : next generation , putting random things up on the walls , card games , playing with the hose , saving beetles , meeting narrators & drying my fone after i dropped it screen first into the water we were playing with . haha pretty good visit if u ask me . =] 
i'm tired .. i wanna go to sleep , but i hate that i just remembered that i have a huge pile of papers , clothes , and a bunch of other random stuff covering my bed !!!! >_< 
Hates how u can make me doubt everything again . 
doesn't know why but this night became crappy , and i don't even know how . hope i have fun with < PROPFEMALE > tomorrow .. 
tiring day today , but all the smiles and laughs made it worth while . =] 
loves reading fanfictions before bed . I miss being a total anime nerd . So getting a bit of that nerdiness back is always fun haha =] 
if i could scream all i wanted without being stared at or having the cops called , i would .. if i did that i probably wouldn't be able to talk for days .. 
talking about < PROPFIRST > lautner makes me laugh and feel sooo much like a teenage girl haha !! 
\Can u hold my pork chop ? \ " the randomest line of the day lol . good day hecka laughs . =] " 
May b going of a little more than 2 hours of sleep . 
doesn't like being stressed out . -_- 
Haha hella fun day . worked got $40 . nd met this one dude ! haha feeling lyk such a girl again . dancing to mexican music is always fun ! =] 
Mom : \do you wanna do anything today ? \ " Me : * in monotone *\" yes . \ " Mom : \ " what do you want to do . \ " Me : \ " go out kill people .. set little kids on fire . \ " Mom :\ " nooo . \ " Yesterday was still amazing . Congrats < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > " 
loves Ouran High School Host Club .. ^_^ but even with anime to distract me , i need to find something else to do or else imma go insane ! >_< 
Jst saw my new bruise form .. weird . 
washing my dogs , going to walmart with my grandma&little cousin , eating animal crackers and drinking caprison , pushing a some random little girl that i didn't know on the swing , and seeing my cousin < PROPMALE > stare and somewhat follow this lil girl named < PROPFEMALE > at the park . this made up my day . 
Knows its not the same anymore , and i dont know what to do about it . =/ 
wants to scream . i'm so freaking sick of everything . 
for some reason i feel like setting things on fire ????? 
Is craving to watch anime or read a < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Hakusho fanfic ( Anenome to b exact . ) this is wat watching a few episodes of YYH does to me . ;( 
knows this is going to be really nerdy but wanted to say :\ 
I love anime sooo much right now . \ 
yeah i had to state it . \ 
if i had a Hiei or Kurama plushie i'd snuggle with it right now lol , \ 
that probably sounds creepy . ^_^ 
covering the walls of my room with random papers , pictures , quotes , and an occasional fanfic , is kinda entertaining and gives me a whole lot more to stare at when i think . 
After 5 months of living here , and one month of attempting , i hav officially defeated the clutter that nested itself in my room so long ago . My room is clean i cn walk without having to avoid objects popping out of the floor ! yes this is big for me . nd a shock to my brother . 
feels soooooo nerdy right now . 
Its really awkward giving some foreign dude we dnt know a ride . 
me : \ ... have u ever had one of those days man ? \ " \ 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > hakusho episodes on school days makes me smile . 
haha it's pretty nice to be able to start and end the day with something i actually like . yes , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > hakusho . \ 
yes , i'm addicted . \ 
i got Smile Bomb too ! =] 
i just want out . 
never in my life have i ever wanted to go to Ohio , but now i want to go for an anime convention just to be able to see these two girls who dance to thriller while cosplaying as Hiei and Kurama . again i feel sooo freaking nerdy . 
\so this is what it feels like to be a stupid girl who refuses to do something thats good for herself . \"" 
my legs hurt so bad but besides that it was a pretty good night(even though we lost)\ 
Going into the band room was pretty interesting and talking to some random people was great . 
I think a change in scenery is much needed . i wana go to alaska and get away from everything and everyone here . 
in my mom's soap opera[El Fantasma de Elena ] my favorite character died(in the show) !!!! he was crazy and pretty demented(with cool hair ) but he was still my favorite !! dang !! \he is one of the only guys who can be creepy as hell but can still look hot while knocking some one unconscious . \ " yeah it's weird haha " 
is not that big a fan of struggling with my cat to get him off the freaking fridge . -__- 
was an observer today . \ 
true fact : pay attention to people's eyes , they do reveal the truth . =/ i kinda worry for them .. 
likes when a fanfic chapter makes me laugh 90% of the time i'm reading it . Anemone is a good story . ^__^ 
this day just doesn't feel right . I think the rest of my week is gonna suck . 
highlight of my day : coming home and finding out my Kurama plushie arrived !! \ 
I'm a nerd and officially sorta creepy . \ 
My brother says i'm a homo ... Oh well i gotsa plushie !! \ 
It sort of makes up for the sh*t that happend today .. 
Feliz 200 anos de independencia Mexico !! Mom's watching the celebration on tv right now . I like their fireworks and the whole celebration seems like fun but tiring . 
You get annoyed at me for the same reasons I don't like you : your anger and attitude . 
didn't know that this would become awkward .. gah-rawr !!!! \ 
The fact that more proof is just there for me to read , makes it even worse ! \ 
>_< 
i like it on the floor 
If the question was \who is the bigger fool ? \ " \ 
walking home made my not-bad-day seem better . =] 
BS thats what everything is now . 
so my dad fell asleep while watching \It's The Great Pumpkin 
I like it on the bed . 
Will someone explain to me why i have the face of a little kid ? -_- 
Thank you < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Hakusho manga volume 16 for brightening up my day . =D 
It's true this isn't anger , because if it were I would have probably felt some form of the emotion . \ 
This is just me not wanting to be around people . \ 
It's really hard for others not to confuse the two . 
Isn't in the mood to deal with optimistic people right now . 
The Diary of < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > was amazingly good . \ 
=] 
uum what's the deal with people you've never seen before in your life sending you friend requests ? \ 
\WTF random mexican dude .. I don't know you !! \"" 
\No 
<3 ' s How to Train Your Dragon . =] 
Finds it kinda interesting how as im walking alone from the 99 cent store to the Dollar Tree , i get a Pet Semetary feeling . Then i think a possessed person is going to try and kill me with a shopping cart . wtf . 
Guesses bright things in the night can be the best thing to entertain a little boy at midnight . 
\But these things take time love . \ 
\To love is to know God . To not love is to not know God . God is love . \"- Padre Ariel(translation ) " 
too much death and too many endings . \ 
too many this year , too many every year you just don't realize it until the deaths affect you or those you care about . \ 
I think I was just reminded of how much I hate endings . 
Just watched < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim vs . the world . it was so completely random lol\ 
Kim : \We are Sex Bob-omb and we are here to watch < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim kick your teeth in !!!! \"" 
well i'm bored & about to quote < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim again =D \ 
Knives:\I've never even kissed a guy . \ " \ 
i'm bored so :\ 
like my status and i'll tell you the truth is . 
Sitting by < PROPFIRST > watching < PROPFEMALE > the Explorer is interesting . 
It's Funny How The Word I Would Use To Describe This Is : Bipolar 
so the satire skit thing didn't go as bad as I was expecting 
blah . 
Sh*t happens , I just wish it wouldn't affect me like it always does . 
Spinning in circles with Manny , pinching Binkz ' cheeks , fighting with Shimmery white powder , syncing a song on youtube to match up with Jozie's phone , listening to a song involving chickens having human arms&being a ninja is a very good way to spend time with Jozie Vigil . It made me forget that there was anything wrong in the first place . 
\Thanks for helping me with my millions of excuses 
\ ' Cause we're living at the mercy of . The pain and the fear . Until we dead it 
I always seem to want to take back words I say whether they were the truth or out of overwhelming emotions . =/ 
I'm bored so if anyone wants to\ 
send me a number to my inbox and i'll tell you how i feel or what i think about you . 
#54 Well you'll be related to me for the rest of my living life . We'll always share part of the same blood . We'll always share the same mother . You're off far away , living your own life like you're supposed to . You have a habit of always wanting me to tell you how I feel about you or the truth about you or something whenever I do these things . 
#10 well , still my most most memorable moment involves soccer for CYSO . From playing on the field against you and having you ask me about Mr. Frey's math homework while playing freshmen year , to hanging out with you and watching random soccer games sophmore year . School wise , I never see you except for that one passing period haha . 
#63 So I got you in two classes and we still don't really talk although we sit kinda close or at least in one class we sat close before . Anyways out of a majority of the people are know you are one of the hardest people for me to beat at a poking match . It's like when you poke me , I poke you back then you react so fast i didn't even really move an inch before you get me again . 
#700 I saw you at KFC today !!!!! :D yea that was random just saying . but anyways I really don't know what to say about you that I haven't already said . Most my memories with you were from last year . We haven't really made many this year so far , that would probably be because we never talk except on here occasionally haha . but anyways when it come to what I think about you , I just think \I hope she stays happy . \"" 
#103109 lmao well when I saw the number and the smiley , I'll admit it made me smile and partially laugh haha . =] well what is there to say about you ? hmm you got me thinking back to 8th grade and dancing with you to Teardrops On My Guitar by < PROPFIRST > Swift . You got me thinking of the times you listened to my problems when I felt there was no there to help me . 
# 6,000,000,000,000,000,000 Dear person who sent me the number \ 
6,000,000,000,000,000,000 you are awesome because you chose such a fricking long number haha . Well there is a lot to say to you . For one thing I love you . You're my friend , you're one my closest friends in high school which to me means something considering how I do not like to consider people friends especially in this day and age . 
\try not to scream as they sew your mouth shut . \"" 
Is scared of things that go bump in the night . \ 
=/ 
I'm surviving . That's decent enough , right ? 
After thinking it through , I believe I can say 2010 kicked my a ** 
So my dad is watching < PROPMALE > the Red-Nosed Reindeer . After watching the scene where they find out < PROPMALE > is wearing a fake nose and after seeing their reactions I yelled out :\ 
\Santa should kicked in the balls !! He's a douchebag !! \"" 
\So as far as I can tell 
Me : \meno 
\So explain to me why I feel like I'm going insane . \"" 
f**k the holidays .

\She stole my heart . I'll be taking hers with a lawn dart now but \

\People think that I must be a very strange person . This is not correct . I have the heart of a small boy . It is in a glass jar on my desk . \"- Stephen < PROPMALE > "

\Take all the courage you have left\ 
explain to me why I have such hostility towards the male gender today . 
Just finished watching 500 Days of Summer . I <3 the music in it . Nice movie . :] 
I realized I'm at fault . Now all I can do is sit back and do nothing . I wonder how it'll turn out . 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > Happy P.O.C.B.A.S. day !! 
Just not feeling it today . 
\It's true 
is really tired of getting told to think one way then when i do and it doesnt work out , i get told \well you're expecting too much . \"" 
\So get on your feet\ 
melancholy . 
I wish there was a song that I could sing to get this feeling to go away , \ 
but sadly there isn't . 
is trying to sing . 
i miss when i would always wear big guy shirts . \ 
i need to go buy some . 
i'm tired of trying to clean my room , \ 
i wanna light things on fire . O_O

I gotta admit getting goodnight hugs and kisses from the 8 nieces and nephews is very nice . <3
