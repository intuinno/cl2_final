I am now enrolled for sign language class . The goal to be an interpreter one day soon 

FACEBOOK EXPERIMENT- if you are reading this , whether we do or don't speak often , please post a comment of your first memory of you and me . when you've finished , post this paragraph on your own statuses ; you'll be surprised what people ... remember about you ... REMEMBER- My parents are on here , not that there is anything that they shouldn't hear 
I just saw some of the first videos taken of my grandbaby . WOW it is incredible . I think I was a little awe struck . A few short months and I will see him or her in person . I loved to see how full of life and wiggly already . I loved the little feet . Truely a humble miricle . Love you guys , thanks for sharing with me ! 
It is amazing how adult children can get you to do things you never thought you would . Example : Going to haunted houses/mazes and like today eating sushi .... I guess the adventures do continue in life . That is really funny and keeps life intresting . I love you guysI have had the best week , spending lots of time with my children , seeing miricles , , and starting SUMMER BREAK . Life is a gift ! 
We actually got some sod and put it in today for Labor day . It is so awesome to see green grass on my yard where it ought to be . How cool is that ! It makes me soooo happy . 
One of every 10 people are born gay . That means 1 of every 10 people is instantly put down , given bad labels , left alone , put in a minority , and so much else all for something they didn't ask for . Many gay teens are going to suicide as a way of escaping . If you want to tell them life will get better , and you respect and love them for who they are , copy and paste this . Most of you won't , but let's see the 5% who will . 
Please put this on your status if you know or love someone who is gay . My wishfor 2010 is that people will understand that being gay is not a diseasenor a choice - people who are gay are not looking for a cure butACCEPTANCE and EQUAL RIGHTS ... 93% won't copy and paste this 
I loved you the minute I heard your heartbeat . I loved you the minute you were born . Then I saw your face and fell in love some more . You were only a minute old but I knew I would die for you , and to this day I still would . When you choose to have a child you make a decision to allow your heart to walk around outside of your body . Put this on your status if you have children you love more than life 
A true friend doesn't care when you're broke , what you weigh , what name \ 
brand you wear , if your house is a mess , where you live , about your past , or if your family is filled with crazies . They love you for who you are . A true friend can go long periods of time without speaking , but never questions the friendship .... Re-post this if ... you have at least one true friend , they will know who they are !!
