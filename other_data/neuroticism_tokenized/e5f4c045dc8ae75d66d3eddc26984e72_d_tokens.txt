It seems like Summer is infinite and then BAM ! : it abruptly comes to an end . I've never really become used to that . Oh well , its not like my Summer was anything special . I would usually sit on my computer until about 4 AM and then sleep ' til about 1 PM and then repeat the process . I know , I'm a winner when it comes to life .... Still , needless to say , I'm dreading my return to school ( as I'm sure everyone else is ) . 
Nobody dies a virgin , life fucks everybody . 
Well , I did it . I just invited half the grade to be friends with me on Facebook . Actually , its going better than I expected it to , a total of 3 people have accepted thus far .... Thanks , guys . 
Not doing much .... Just drinking Monster and listening to < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > . Yeah , my life is so exciting , you're all just envious of me . 
Say , is anybody doing the mixed up clothing thing tomorrow ? I've never really gone along with the whole special school dress-up day thing , but I thought about giving it a try if anybody else is doing it ( I don't want to walk in there and be the only one , ya know ) . I , of course , intend on making it extremely sexualized , if I do decide to dress-up , that is .... 
Damn , I'm out out of Monster ! I'll have to run and get some more later tonight .

Bridge Over Troubled Water -By : < PROPMALE > and Garfunkel 
This world in which we live is one of silence . Why is it that we can never bring ourselves to speak the things that truly matter ? We let all the pain and loneliness in our lives accumulate until everything seems to be beyond any hope .... But then , if we should choose to abandon our sense of self-reliance altogether , we become vulnerable and are at the mercy of those we open up to .... 
The Sweet Smell of Cancer- As the sweet smell of cancer engulfs the room , And seals me shut within its icy womb , I can’t help but to rejoice at my tomb’s cold embrace , For at last I have found something much lonelier than I , And now , with my newfound friend , I may finally die . 
The only thing that I disdain more than censorship is the censorious , fascistic pigs that embrace it ....

Woo-fucking-hoo ! I'll be kicking off the New Year with a throbbing hangover , most likely ! 
I can imagine nothing worse than coming to disdain the one thing that is utterly inescapable : oneself . Alas , I reached that point some time ago .... 
The following bit has been taken from Clive Barker's short story \Dread\ " ( which made its debut in Volume II of Barker's \ " Books of Blood\ " series ) ... : " 
At times I feel as though I am an ever-fading shadow in a world of lights . Other times , I feel to be an insipid contribution to a world of shadow . Oddly enough , never do I find myself to be the dying light , as that which never was cannot hope to die .

I just performed a test run on one of my exploding blood packet rigs ( for use in my biology short film ) . It has a really nice effect to it , though it's a real pain in the ass to get working ( you have to have the fucker taped down to you really good with a shit-load of duct tape and then have someone tug like hell on the ... fishing line/washer attachment ) . Though , in the end , the results are deliciously gory ....

\Sensitiveness is closely allied to egotism ; and excessive sensibility is only another name for morbid self-consciousness . The cure for tender sensibilities is to make more of our objects and less of our selves . \ " -- Christian Nestell Bovee " 
The ability to word my perceptions in such an eloquent manner has always been one of my finer attributes . Alas , I fear that I may lose it . 
No pain is the equal of remorse . 
Tomorrow will be my last day at SCF , may you all fare well .... I know , I know , I'll miss you all too .... But , as hard as it may be , I ask that you supress those tears , for life shall < PROPFEMALE > on without me ( albeit , with a lesser sense of purpose or joy ) .... 
Goodbye to all . 
Thank you all . Be seeing you . 
Weep not , for nothing shall come of it . Alas , I have been a devotee to the fruitlessness of tears and to the futility that is their origin for far too long . The bonds must be severed , and from therein , I am as I choose to be . Chained not by fate , nor by others , but by self . The bonds must be severed , and severed they shall be . 
Existence does not fall victim to the death of one's physical being , it falls victim to the death of the dreams left behind . To ensure remembrance , one must keep their dreams alive even after their body has died .

I'm in a bad way , right now . 
My God , I'm always so tense , but , then , I suppose that I'm more comfortable that way than I am relaxed , which is kinda odd , I think . Perhaps it is because I feel much more vulnerable when I'm not so , y'know , uptight . I guess that , like , I think it may be as though I'm abandoning all regards of self-reliance by easing up , and then I worry that I‘ll subsequently be harmed by doing so , somehow .... I don't know .... 
I'm so tired , but I can't sleep .

\The end comes when we no longer talk with ourselves . It is the end of genuine thinking and the beginning of the final loneliness .
