Do you neglect your life ? Neglect yourself ? Are you content to live with failure or pray for something else ? I am your regret , your sense of loss , your abandonment Emotionless life , resist temptation to reach out Won't be your saviour to smash your doubts I am your abandonment , refuse the urge to bleed out I am not your fucking hope 
So you wanna play games with my head ? \ 
\ 
Fuck you , make me fall apart , I wish that I was dead\ 
I just can't believe I fell , for such a blackened heart\ 
You played me for a fool and used me from the start\ 
If I tear you open wide , take a look inside\ 
Are you pretty ? \

Your a fake\ 
You never stayed by me\ 
I should have let you go a long\ 
time ago\ 
I know it's not all of your fault\ 
But I feel that it's better this \ 
way\ 
I always thought that it was worth it\ 
Many things untold - thats the beauty of it i guess 
Make no mistake\ 
Forget my name , you know You wish you could\ 
I'm a nightmare , see me while you toss and turn\ 
I am the lesson , I know you'll never learn\ 
I know you'll never learn ... That'll overcome . \

So this is goodbye . But I'm afraid to speak , so with words I'll tell the story . You meant so much to me . And like lights the nights upon nights to come , \ 
I will dream of you , and know that I will see you soon .
