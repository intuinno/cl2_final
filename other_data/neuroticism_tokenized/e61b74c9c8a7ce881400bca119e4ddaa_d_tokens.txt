Is currently in a poke war with about 10 people . 
Is mayonnaise an instrument ? 
1 of every 10 people born are gay . That means 1 out of 10 people are instantly put down , given bad labels , left alone , put in a minority and so much more . All for something they didn't ask for . Many gay teens are committing suicide as a way of escaping . If you want to tell them life will get better and you respect them for who they are , copy and paste this . Most of you won't , but let's see the 5% of you who will . 
Just got back from a week-long school trip in Vienna-it was AMAZING <3 
There is a fan < PROPFEMALE > for my dad on Facebook . Who could have guessed . xD 
Every person has 1000 wishes , a cancer patient only one : to get better . I know , that 97% will not post this as their status , be one of the 3% and put this as your status , at least for an hour , for those who died because of cancer or are still fighting it . 
Is deeply moved by the soulfulness of the bed intruder song . < PROPFEMALE > Rocksand Dowling < PROPMALE > Smith 
Saw our costumes for the school play . I dare say we will make very attractive potato sacks . 
Like this status and I'll post a random quote from Phineas and Ferb to your wall :D 
Can I see your hat Mister ? 
Changed my profile pic to Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz to support Evanne Field's childhood memory movement :D This involves changing your profile pic to any of your favorite cartoon/childhood TV show characters between November 17th and 23rd .
