is really irritated today . 

is nervous . Again . Goddamnit ! 
Also , the RAM upgrade for my laptop came today ! :D Just gotta install in and then , I am going to scream like a little girl . 
got her gradebook and feels all initiated . Yeah , I know . I'm lame . :P 
survived her first day of teaching . She found out this is only profession where they're going to let her pace around the room and make bad jokes like it's utterly normal behavior . 
is sick . Fantastic . 
' s rat had two babies . I don't have pictures yet , but soon . 
Babeh Rat Update : :) Everybody made it through the night . Going out to Walmart today to pick up more supplies for a permanent maternity cage setup since rat-babies have to stay in there for 4 weeks . I can finally get poor Sem out of her little plastic \apartment\ " too . :P ( Pics soon . ) " 
Squeaker Update Day 3 : They are squeaky ! And they have ears today ! :D Widdle , teeny ears ! :3 And a few markings . One of them--I'm pretty sure -- will have ( at least ) a black hood . The other baby is going to be more light-colored , white or beige I think . No genders right now--I'm not that good . Tomorrow I'm taking a closer look . Pictures when I get a camera . 
is exhausted . It is too early in the day for me to be this beat up . 
would just like the Internet to know that Grading Is Hard . That is all . 
is really , really , really tired of the EGO Conference Schedule Booklet . I THINK , I HOPE it's finally ready to go to print now . 
is being nerdy : \There's another 2x Weekend on Perfect World ! And I can actually PLAY this time !! Omgyay ! :D \"" 
is packing for tomorrow . Don't really want to go back to school yet . X_X 
is a bit worn but glad to be done reading final portfolios ! 
is in a good mood now ! :D Yay ! Weekend ! Not Yay . Grading . D: 
I finished my English 500 paper on Resident Evil 5 ! :D D: Okay , well , MOSTLY . I've still got to go back , clean up the citations , and make sure it all makes sense . 
is done with her English 500 < PROPFEMALE > ! :D YAAAY ! 
doesn't know if she should be disturbed that there is a paper due tomorrow and there have been no desperate student e-mails about it yet . Maybe in morning ! :D 
is done grading ! :D Now it is REALLY all over ! 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas ! :D I am 23 today ! 
got out to the bus station at North Quad this morning and found that someone had puked on the bench . Freshmen are classy . 
... I really hope I wasn't the only one who could never get the WIU Bookstore order to accept Western Voices and said , \F it . \ " ._. Crap . >_> Did not realize how required that was . Oh dear . " 
wants to cut off her hair again . 
kinda wishes she hadn't left her DS in the boyfriend's room ... 
is ... behind schedule . 
I am actually done with all my stuff for now . :/ It's amazing how quick I am when I finally sit down and do something . 
got 17 in her class today ! I should not be this pleased about * attendance * of all things . My < PROPFIRST > have been abymsal this semester -- so I am happy about only missing 5 . 
I am * counting the hours * until I will be in Crete again . It is so totally time for break . 
almost done -- just got to teach and pack tomorrow and I can get outta here . 
I am sooo glad to be back home . Even if I have to grade tonight ; I'm just not thinking about it . 
I am pissed at < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > again . I feel like the only thing I'm learning from my narrative theory class is that Women Do Not Have Narrative Lives and exist only as narrative devices to serve the characterization of men and any female writers or stories about women are abberations best left unlooked at . Hate hate * hate * it . Going to go read a book by a woman until I feel less pissed . 
I had a Hot Pocket today . D: It's * officially * Official . My pet rats eat MUCH better than I do . 
is writing a letter of recommendation . Ho boy . 
TOC is odd . Just thought I'd share . :P 
I don't like talking about my job here , but man , it amazes me how much my students cannot read or refuse to . 
is sick today . Greeeat . 
is losing her voice today . Been a fun week with that . I hope my vocal cords can pull themselves together for a 50-minute class tomorrow . 
Holy crap . Grading my research papers is depressing this semester . 
Yay ! I'm almost done grading for the semester ! 8D Now -- now I just gotta do my homework ! 
I am shocked that I finished reading final portfolios about 3 o'clock . After I spent yesterday telling people not to expect me back until after 5 . Now , I just have to finish revising my narrative theory paper . 
is clutching her tea as a heating device . Stupid , freezing dorm . 
T.T I get to go home tomorrow -- so happy . <3 
Inform 7 is actually kind-of fun to program in when I am not rushing my brain off to finish a class assignment . 
I hate packing ! 
You can tell I really hate packing because I am on * Facebook * to avoid it . I never go on Facebook to avoid anything . 
All done with grading ! ^_^ All done with everything until Summer Independent Study starts ! 
saw < PROPMALE > of Persia yesterday . Did not leave happy with it . Boring adaptation with some decent shots , irritating characters , and not nearly enough fights . If you really liked the game , you should just rent this . 
Dear English 620 Project Proposal , I hate you . I hate you . I hate you . No Love , < PROPFEMALE > 
Nothing wears off quite so fast as the novelty of waking up to a flooding house at 5 in the morning . :| 
Ohmygod , Ludology makes me swear . * So Much . * It's like nothing of merit came from video games after the mid-90s . Especially if America/Europe didn't make it . >_< I really hate theory sometimes ! 
I just realized that I've got final projects in mind already for * both * my classes this semester . God , I'm a big ol ' nerd . :/ 
I thought I would inform everybody that , three months later , I * still * hate packing . 
A student saw me in my Silent Hill 3 shirt . :P One of them knows I'm * really * human now . There goes my robot ! teacher cred . 
I HATE knowing how Hollywood's finances work . < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim vs . the World was a financial failure while Resident Evil : Afterlife is flying high , stomping it with at least $100M ( and growing ) . That is UNJUST . Who keeps going to < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE>'s movies ??? 
I can't tell if Gamestop is lying to me ( or not ) about this 10/12/2010 ship date for Dragon Age : Origins Ultimate Edition--that's , like , 2 weeks before it's supposed to come out . Getting DA :O -Ultimate early might just convince me to give them my money though . >_> 
I feel stupid . I spent 45 minutes swearing at Scribus only to figure out that once I got the < PROPFEMALE > of the program , I will probably never go back to InDesign lay-out building again . LOL Desktop publishing ! 8D 
> ( I hate when they send lab techs to do maintenance while I am teaching ! > ( 
Dragon Age : Ultimate Edition comes out tomorrow ! I am stupid excited . :) Even as I can't play it until Thursday . Not cool , grad school . :( 
You know , during this busy-busy week of final essays , grading , and not enough clean spoons , I suddenly see the total practicality of something like \Go-gurt\ " . :/ Go figure . " 
Realized I walked out of the house this morning in my Dragon Age hoodie and my new Legend of < PROPFEMALE > shirt . Had to run back inside and grab my Resident Evil 5 ' Kijuju ' pendant to complete my Total Gaming Nerd ensemble . > D 3 different games in one outfit ! 
Thank you so much for the birthday wishes , everyone ! :3 And < PROPFEMALE > Christmas ! 
I finally figured out how to resolve the argument in my stupid paper ! Hurray ! Hopefully , this project will finally END now . 
:| < PROPMALE > Lacan is REALLY stupid . 
Oh my god . If < PROPMALE > Wake doesn't get a sequel , I am going to have to hurt someone . ( Haven't figured out who , but SOMEONE . )
