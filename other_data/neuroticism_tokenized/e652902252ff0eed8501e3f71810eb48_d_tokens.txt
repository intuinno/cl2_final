< PROPFEMALE > CHRISTMAS 
Happy New year Facebook and friends 
Red 
I like it on the dinner table ... 
was intrigued and now very VERY disturbed at her discovery of Live action < PROPFEMALE > movies while looking for information on the upcoming < PROPFEMALE > installment for the Wii . Which is also unsatifactory in way of graphic capablities in the very least . CURSES ! 
My dog died yesterday while I was at work ... -sad face- I wish I had been there and at the same time am relieved to not have been ... 
-Does happy dance- Just got home a bit ago from swimming . Sadly everyone was too much of a lame face to join so only < PROPFEMALE > and I did , but it's whatever . We still had fun . We played in the water and made a fire . She explored and I took a nap ... Also I have a friggen angry burn on my right arm too ! -sad face- 
Okay so game night is on hold . I have a cold and the thing with < PROPMALE > and mom still can't get the carpet cleaned so yar ... Hopefully when I get back from Washington it will be a different story . Also going to be starting school again August 30 so we'll have to see what work and school alow as far as game night is concerned ... 
I feel like crap and work in about 3.5 hours . -Dies- 
So I totally went on a downloading spree ... Blood on the Dance Floor , Heart , Mindless Self Indulgence , < PROPFEMALE > , Shinedown and Maximum the Hormorne Discographies , and also Adobe CS5 Extended edition . All in all very fruitful however the music tells all of you just how bipolar my taste in music happens to be ... 
Got to go to work in about an hour and am almost finished packing . Washington here I come ! Yay to getting a vacation ... no matter how short . 
Made it to Washington okay . Going to be hanging out tomorrow with with < PROPFIRST > and I think < PROPFEMALE > and of course < PROPFIRST > . Sweet beans and stuff . Anyway thought I'd give people a heads up . Maybe I'll post some pictures ... 
Oh no I work in less than 3 hours . And I'm awake now ... this may not end well ... 
So yeah ... didn't go to work today . My Grandmother got taken to the hospital and her heart stopped . While they got it started again she is hooked up to a million machines and whatever else to keep her alive because all her systems are shutting down . All mom and I can do is sit in the ICU waiting room and see what will happen ... FML ! 
I haven't been online a lot lately , but I just wanted to let ya all know that my grandmother seems to be doing a whole lot better . 
Totally just finished with my Interpersonal homework and I have to work in less than 5 hours . Good thing I napped today . Work and school will prove interesting . At least what I see of them behind closed lids . 
Guess what ? Game night is back ! Sadly only one day a week since I have school and work to schedule around , but it's whatever . So yeah Tuesday's now only instead of our Monday and Thursday meetings . I have class til 5:50 but that's plenty of time before hand . I was thinking about hooking up Rock band again . We haven't played in forever . Anyways same place and time , just a different day . 
Hey guys game night my place at 8 text or reply if you are coming 
Sadly no game night tonight . I'm really not feeling well :( 
Hey guys . Game night is here again . For those of you that didn't receive the text or I just forgot about you . Please come and < PROPFEMALE > out and stuff . 
I made a HAT ! Well < PROPFEMALE > helped and burned herself in the process ... not to mention it isn't completely finished and it is technically the second I have made , but yar ... Minor details . 
Yay I for a a new phone 
Just because you're old doesn't mean you can drive like an asshole ! 
From a web comic I'm reading : Male --> I give up ... just TELL me what you WANT ... Female --> Someone who already KNOWS ... Male --> THERE'S NO SUCH THING ! 
Q : Are you morally opposed to paying for sex ? \ 
A : No , I'm morally opposed to herpes ... 
So yeah this is a little later than usual . My phone crapped out and I just got back home . Yes there is game night . Hope this wasn't too late . Will text as well when phone decides to turn back on . 
FFFFFFFFFFFF I needs to do homework and go to an early morning class and pick up a friend in < PROPFIRST > and then go to another class and maybe do a bike ride and then do game night . -DIES- I just ... ldghqwe ; jkhke ; i Yeah I just did that .... feel my pain . 
Ffffff dammit I am still awake -dies- stupid homework !

Finished with homework and still time to spare . I am a master at procrastination ! 
Holy death roll !

Changeyour facebook profile picture to a cartoon character from your childhood , invite your friends to do the same . Until Monday ( Dec . 6 , 2010 ) , there should be no human faces on facebook but an invasion of memories . This is a campaign for children's rights and for the fight against child violence 
Back to work at noon 
Game night at my place . 8 o clock . See some of you there . 
I miss moments with groups of friends late at night when our conversations would start with something along the likes of ... \If this were a horror movie ... \ " Or ... \ " If Zombies start coming out at us ... \ " Good times . " 
Woot ! On an extended break to help labor . Then back to work til 4 . 
GAME NIGHT YAY ! 
Totally got a new piercing for Christmas ! 
Final grades got posted . I got 3 B's and a C . Can't complain . At least I passed . Many thanks to all those that helped me achieve those grades . Namely < PROPFEMALE > Weideman , < PROPFEMALE > Weideman , and < PROPFEMALE > Pernigotti . Much loves ! 
Just a reminder for those that were planning on doing the white elephant with me , it is Tuesday the 28th at my place starting at 8pm . Bring a $5 or under wrapped present . Hope to see you there . Will post another reminder in a few days . < PROPFEMALE > Christmas Everyone . 
White elephant reminder : Tuesday the 28th with 5 dollar or under gift . 
White elephant tonight . My place at 8 . Be seeing some of you there . 
My throat is sore and my head is throbbing . I also can not breathe through my nose . I haven't decided who is to blame yet , but I have it narrowed down to 3 people . You know who you are ! 
First day of classes ... Super ! Only not particularly . I have math homework . Go figure and a shit ton of reading . This is going to be a very long and painful process . It took me 3 days to read 26 pages in my Medical Ethics book and that one is the shortest . FML 
Totally got addicted to Plants vs Zombies . Not even gonna lie .

( I made it easier ... ) 
Read 80 pages of very data orientated information over the week end and be ready to talk about it on Wednesday . I'd LOVE to ! F ! 
Well , I think this college student is going to hit the sack . I got the majority of my math done , read a chapter of my psych book , did some of my ethics homework , listened to music , posted stuff to facebook and downloaded second life . Not too shabby ... 
Well I suppose I should get off facebook . Damn homework sucks up all my time . I better get cracking on it before work since I didn't wake up early like I was planning . 
Yay game night ! My place at 8 . See some of you there .

Yay taxes filed . I get about 890 back in the next couple days . And then I'll get about 1,300 from the school . Also qualified for an additional 400 , but I'm not sure how I'll receive that or if I will . 
And the snow strikes back . FFFFFFF !!!! 
Game night 
YAY MONEY OMG ! 
Totally just finished a game of monopoly . It was pretty epic ! 
Game night once again . Yay get together time ! 
Health Care Delivery : not my favorite . Not only is the book extremely long and boring I just can't even bring myself to participate in discussion without wanting to go to sleep . FML How will I ever pass ! 
FFFFFF friggen homework . Why must you make my procrastinating brain work in over drive ? FFFFFFFFFFF 
Well it looks like it's off to work I go . Happy v-day to those cute couples out there and an even happier singles awareness to my fellow cohorts ! 
Excited to report that in the months since snow fell and the < PROPMALE > rating holidays came and went I only gained 2 pounds . So awesome . Epic bike rides and more weight loss here I come ! 
So aside from the screen on the camera not working ... all is well . I just got the two lenses I ordered yesterday and today and they fit . Uber plus ! Otherwise I'll just have to do it like everyone before digital and cross my fingers for good shots . 
Blueberry ! 
So my Qwest internet service froze my internet this morning for \High usage\ " ... I feel like the stipulations of my cell phone plan are infecting my internet provider . " 
Game night 8 to midnight . My place . 
You and I wake up in a psychiatric < PROPMALE > together . Using 4 words , what would you say to me ? NOTE : If you comment , you must copy and paste this to your status , so I may comment on yours as well . Be a good sport and play along . 4 words is harder than you think ......!! ;) 
Totally got my wand , house patch , and Hogwarts wallet today . Also received my house tie . Now I just need my robes and uniform and all will be complete . 
No game night tonight . 
Game night . Usual time and place . 
Pretty busy day at work . I feel like ten tons of crap . My throat is raw . My body hurts from coughing . And my nose is stuffy . And 2 customers think I'm rude . I can't win . 
No game night later today . Many apologies . I am going to the play at CMR and won't be home in time to have . Might do one in Tuesday to make up for it . 
< PROPFEMALE > Frye : morphine is good .
