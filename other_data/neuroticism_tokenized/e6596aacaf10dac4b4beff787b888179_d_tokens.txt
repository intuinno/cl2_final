12 marks my start on old habits ;) 

I have my lion back now ! :D 
I'm pretty much stuck at home tonight =/ 
has a friend who looks like a guy but is really a girl named < PROPMALE > L Simpson 
had a great day even though it rained :D 
is making a mozzarella cheese tower ! 
was left at home =/ 
if I hit on a little boy I could probably go to jail =/ 
I think < PROPFIRST > should take all those pictures off his Facebook !! 
so after everyone finished leaving it was past 3 in the morning , well < PROPFEMALE > slept over and since she is a giant she took up all the bed space , pillows , and the oxygen ! I was all balled up and I woke up with my whole body aching =/ 
\I've found out a reason for me to change who I used to be a reason to start over new and the reason is you . \"" 
finally back from my last state competition at Corpus !! The water blows there , it's like drinking directly from the pool =P 
< PROPFEMALE > so I was thinking we could do that yoga thing , you know what that'll help out (; 
so yesterday at Dicks it was my 18th birthday again , and I had a boyfriend named < PROPFIRST > accompanied by a cracker lover < PROPFIRST > , a skidmarking < PROPFIRST > , and a gay \small\ " < PROPMALE > ! Dreams do come true =P " 
so once again I befriend the < PROPFIRST > police because of my lovely sister , the best part is I was the one to get in trouble with my parents . Does the day get any better ? Yes it does . 
day turned out better than I thought my car is in perfect condition , and I won't be the only one going to Texas A&M . < PROPMALE > Martinez is going too ! WOO HOO ! he'll help me in physics =P hmmm dorm < PROPMALE > ? hahha 
well this week is turning out great , I went to court for my ticket and I'm getting my money back =P I talked my way out of it easy as 3.14 :DDDD 
ugh , I keep having these weird dreams . I should really stop watching lifetime movies . haha 
crap I just remembered I had to pick up my uncle from the airport like 7 hours ago ... dammit ! 
hahaa I have nothing to do just look at my recent activity ! I shall go to a friend's house now !! 
So I almost wet my pants yesterday thanks to < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFIRST > in hot potato baby !! I kicked older women butt in some games and then went to finish my night at < PROPMALE>'s party (: 
hmm < PROPFEMALE > !! I got lost going back home I was going in circles around green tree or tea then all those other streets until I finally saw danieldale , I almost got out the car and kissed the street !! I never ever get lost , and out of all the places !! 
my guinea pig is under my bed eating my ipod =/ I cant reach him !! Someone come rescue my ipod !! 
so < PROPMALE > taught me how to play tennis .... NOT !!! bad teacher ! Then we saw my stalker < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > at kidsville ; sweet day :D 
\Don't poop where you eat ! \ " < PROPMALE > 8 ) " 
crap , ACT totally passed again , I was registered and everything .... I need to get my calender book back , I'm lost . 
i have nothing to do today , no homework , no shopping , no joy rides , i already went out , i've done it all .... and it's bad for playing tennis right now . any one up for a game of pong ? 
90's X-men !! that's all I have to say xD 
So I was thinking ... < PROPFIRST > Delgado is nothing but a jerk who likes catching smaller fish than me and likes beating me to bed with guys I wasn't going to bed with .. Scandalous ? yes .. and if he reads this he should know that I'm getting certified before he does ! 
I could probably write a book over the dumb things I have done in the past years . There's been playing with alligators , rattle snakes , scorpions and squirrels . brick volleyball , traffic rollerblading , roof to roof jumping , red lights , playing chicken , fire crackers inside cars and pants , cow poop throwing ... Gahh I should just write a book .

< PROPMALE > Belanovo ate DOG !! that is so gross =/ ehh THROW UP IN MY MOUTH !
