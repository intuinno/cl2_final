doesn't want to brag but is celebrating 20 pounds lost ! Yeah baby ! 
- < PROPFIRST > hit me with a cart and called me a chipmunk !

Do any of us really know everybody on our friend list ? Here is a task for you . I want all my fb friends to comment on this status about how you met me . After you comment , copy this to your status so I can do the same . You will be amazed at the results you get in 12 hours 
Attention Shoppers ! If you're feeling bitchy keep your ass at home ! 
It's February 14th , to some people it's < PROPFIRST>'s Day ... For the rest of us it's Single Awareness Day ( S.A.D ) 
People seriously need to lower their dosage on their moron pills 
Attention Shoppers ! Unless your butt is literally bigger than a school bus , there's no reason for you to take up the ENTIRE aisle ! 
Its a sad day when your favorite , most comfortable pair of jeans become too holy to wear anymore 
Attention Shoppers ! MOVE ! That is all 
is totally nerding out right now , just found out their re-releasing the sailor < PROPFEMALE > comics in september ! 
It's really sad that no one believes in manners or common courtesy anymore 
really wants to be over this sore throat and cough :(
