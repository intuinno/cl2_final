I can certainly say that I'm far from a big basketball fan but I can honestly say this : Lebron is a cunt . \ 
Plain and simple . \ 
Most professional athletes ARE . You know why ? Because very VERY few of them actually give a shit about the team or city they play for . \ 
Professional athletes cannot help but be swayed by cash . ITS WHAT THEY ALL PLAY FOR . Miami has more money and better , higher paid players . Hence the move . 

PT2>>>>>>>>>Don't get me wrong . I'm not trying to justify his choice . I think it\ 
makes him a quitter . Worse than that it's a big white flag of surrender\ 
on his legacy . He was not able to elevate himself or his team to a\ 
championship . \ 
\ 
NOT A SINGLE ONE . 
PT3>>>>>>>>>>>>>It's not that he couldn't . He CAN'T . Not without alot of help . I guess\ 
to me that swipes him off the pedestal you have all put him off . At\ 
least in my eyes . If it doesn't have the same effect for YOU just go\ 
comfort yourself with the memory of all the NBA Championships he brough\ 
us . 
It's the ol ' saying that rings true from dozens upon dozens of former coaches through the years : There is no ' I ' in TEAM . \ 
It takes a team to win and < PROPMALE > just has to do a better job of building one . 
Stupid computer still isn't fixed . Text me @ 843.222.5053 Hopefully it will be working by this weekend .
