we're so focused on finding our happy ending we don't learn how to read the signs . How to tell from the ones who want us and the ones who don't , the ones who will stay and the ones who will leave . And maybe a happy ending doesn't include a guy , maybe ... it's you , on your own , picking up the pieces and starting over , freeing yourself up for something better in the future . Maybe the happy ending is ... just ... moving on

A dream is a wish your heart makes When you're fast asleep In dreams you lose your heartaches Whatever you wish for , you keep Have faith in your dreams and someday Your rainbow will come smiling thru No matter how your heart is grieving If you keep on believing the dream that you wish will come true

you never know how strong you really are , until being strong is the only choice you have . 
don't give up , just be yourself ; because life's too short to be anyone else . 
Maturity has more to do with what types of experiences you've had , and what you've learned from them and less to do with how many birthdays you've celebrated . <333333333 
if you make your dreams reality , reality will soon become a dream . <333333 
100.3 fever . yep , it's what i deserve . 
don't let your lights go down , don't let your fire burn out , ' cause somewhere somebody needs a reason to beleive . Why don't you rise up now ? Don't be afraid to stand out , thats how the lost get found . So when you get the < PROPMALE > are you going to take it ? theres a really big world at your fingertips and you know you have the < PROPMALE > to change it . 
REALLY REALLLY REALLLLLLY WANTS TO GO TO THE DRIVING RANGE !

sucks at swallowing pills .... 
I’ve been searching , wandering and hurting , ashamed of the shape I’m in , afraid you’ll see who I really am . But you invite me in , doesn’t matter where I’ve been , your arms are open wide , there’s nothing left to hide . How can this be love so unfailing , you reached down and lifted me from ashes to beauty 
i LOVE football (:

CLEMSON BABBBYYYYY (: 
GO DAWGS ! (:

had the best weekend with my favorite people in to whole world ???? (: 
homework , running .. and then more homework . but i get ihop in the morning (: yipppeeee . 
There comes a time when every life goes off course . In this desperate moment you must choose your direction . Will you fight to stay on the path while others tell you who you are ? Or will you label yourself ? Will you be honored by your choice ? Or will you embrace your new path ? Each morning you choose to move forward or to simply give up 
At this moment there are 6,470,818,671 people in the world . Some are running scared . Some are coming home . Some tell lies to make it through the day . Others are just now facing the truth . Some are evil men , at war with good . And some are good , struggling with evil . Six billion people in the world . Six billion souls . And sometimes -- all you need is one ??????? 
I know how important it is in life not necessarily to be strong but to feel strong . To measure yourself at least once . To find yourself at least once in the most ancient of human conditions . Facing the blind death stone alone , with nothing to help you but your hands and your own head 
soccer tournament starting tomorrow (: 
won our first game in the tournament 5 to 1 ! (:

He sees everything black and white never let nobody see him cry ; Well I don't let nobody see me wishing he was mine 
I could be your favorite blue jeans with the holes in the knees In the bottom of the top drawer . I could be your little beauty < PROPFEMALE > - just a little outta reach , or the girl livin next door . I'll be your angel givin up her wings If that's whatchya need ; I'd give everything to be your anything 
Remember , if you ever need a helping hand , it's at the end of your arm , as you get older , remember you have another hand : The first is to help yourself , the second is to help others . 
Never look down on anybody unless you're helping him up 
People are like stained-glass windows . They < PROPFEMALE > and shine when the sun is out , but when the darkness sets in , their true beauty is revealed only if there is a light from within . 
What lies behind us and what lies before us are < PROPFEMALE > matters compared to what lies within us 
To dream of the person you would like to be is to waste the person you are 
There are only two ways to live your life . One is as if though nothing is a miracle . The other is though everything is a miracle 
katherines later (:< 33333333 
just got a good five hours of sleep . i feel kinda better . now i have homework ): 
If you love something , let it go . If it comes back to you , its yours forever . If it dosent , then it was never meant to be 
it's never too late to be whoever you want to be . There's no time limit , stop whenever you want . You can change or stay the same , there are no rules to this thing . We can make the best or the worst of it . see things that startle you . feel things you never felt before . meet people with a different point of view . live a life you're proud of . and if you find that you're not , have the strength to start all over again . 
I dont mind where you come from As long as you come to me . But I dont like illusions I cant see them clearly , I dont care , no I wouldn't dare To fix the twist in you . You've shown me eventually what you'll do , I dont mind I dont care As long as you're here . 
DOES ANYONE HAVE MR . BENNET FOR PHYSICAL SCIENCE ?! 
if my heart were a house , you'd be home <333 
Come on baby blue shake up your tired eyes . The world is waiting for you , may all your dreaming fill the empty sky , But if it makes you happy just remember I'll be by your side and if you don't let go , it's gonna pass you by . 
i hope you like dancing in the rain .

You are the strength , that keeps me walking . You are the hope , that keeps me trusting . You are the light , to my soul . You are my purpose , cause you're all I want You're all I need . You're everything , everything . 
What you feel is what you are , and what you are is beautiful <333 
Half way around the world lies the one thing that you want , buried in the ground , hundreds of < PROPMALE > down . The first thing that arises in your mind when you awake , is bending you ' til you break . <33

Do not go where the path may lead , go instead where there is no path and leave a trail . 
Remember , if you ever need a helping hand , it's at the end of your arm , as you get older , remember you have another hand : The first is to help yourself , the second is to help others 
won our first game ! (: 
and we know it's never simple , never easy , never a clean break , no one here to save me . You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand And I can't breathe without you , but i have to <3
