Had a great day with my wonderful husband on his birthday ! 

I played the best joke on my kids today . I pretended to hide the eggs and had them come out and look for them but really I put them back in the fridge . After about 15 minutes of them searching for the eggs and not being able to find them I gave in and showed them where the eggs were . That was our payback for all the pranks they played on us for April Fools . LOL ! Happy Easter ! (= ' . ' =) 
Had a great time at the circus with my man and Lil men . =) Now its back to work tomorrow .
