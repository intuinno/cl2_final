Well It seems that Uwe Boll finally made a good movie . Rampage is definitely a must see . This movie will put your mind into perspective about how easy it is to loose all sense of security . 
Is really trying to understand why Uwe Boll has such a reputation when after seeing 4 of his latest movies , I have changed my stance on his talent . Hes not afraid of showing the nitty gritty , and I like that about him . 
After being on a movie rampage .... Uwe Boll .... I for one am a fan .
