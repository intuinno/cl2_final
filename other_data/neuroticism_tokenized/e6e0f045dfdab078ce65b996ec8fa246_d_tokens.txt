WOULD YOU PLEASE AKNOWLEDGE THAT I EXIST AT LEAST !? 

my neck is killing me ... that's the last time i goto Dr Acula 
wonders what life has in store ... maybe i should just walk into the back store room ... or maybe life should just get a g@# d ! @%$ inventory list . amateur hour , sheesh 
move forward , look back to see the wake of your motion but never go back , always forward , always to the future , always be the better you . 
joker is the best , but only because he put the laughter in man-slaughter ... 
is so classy he puts the culture in yogurt ! 
death , destruction , chaos ... all hail lord fuzzy < PROPFEMALE > butt 
i hate when you see it . that brief moment before the accident when you realize that your life will never be the same . \ 
that moment of serene peace where you know the future , you know there is\ 
nothing to be done to prevent it , that moment that all your hopes and \ 
fears do not matter , nothing matters . death has stared \ 
you in the face . it's in the face of everyone around . that same paralyzing permanence of an instant . 
look at your status , now back to mine , now back to yours , now back to mine . Sadly yours isn't mine . But if you stopped posting about other things and made this your status , yours could be like mine . Look down , back up . Where are you ? You're on Facebook , reading the status your status could be like . I'm on a computer .
