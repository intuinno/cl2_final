WHAT IF we beat our swords into plowshares and pruning hooks ? When we allow ourselves to become angry , we pollute the Earth with negative vibrations . As the vibrations gather- much like gentle breezes evolve into a hurricane- so do these negative vibrations EXPLODE into WAR ! 
ATTENTION NOKOMIS DRUMMERZ , DANSERZ , and Observerz ... \

It's bad , or appears to be . But think ; we have lived through worse and we always muddle through some how . Take heart and do not abandon faith . Like the PHOENIX we shall rise .
