Well as I’m headed to the sky way up above me I feel my body spinning feeling free and lovely . I am the rumblin sea so come with me on this midnight vibe . And you can feel it if you tune into your radio . Look at the sky , look at the < PROPFEMALE > , look at the way it glow . I aint no ghost so don’t be afraid to go on this midnight vibe ... 
As I ruminate I commiserate for the hearts of the fallen . The girls and boys that never got a < PROPMALE > to be ballin . So I dedicate myself to change the world and they hear me callin . But they never knew how they can stop me cause I keep on callin . And hearts may be tired but they keep beatin . As they survive the fall when fate was weedin . 
You should let the champion inside of you out once and awhile . If you don't he gets cranky and when it gets time to perform he falls flat . 
And this is your D on drugs . I be running round getting high on love . Too much will kill ya I know that’s right . But she got that crack and I got that pipe . Now if she’s the pusha , and I’m the hustla and loves the drug , then this for the lovers ... 
Be yourself and if someone don't like that fuck them
