it's hard 2 watch as others cocoons open to reveal the most exotic creatures and yet to kno that ur own was unwraveled b4 it wuz formed.it's hard to live in a place or time that you don't belong in . and even harder to pretend that you do . 
ironic to be lead on like a mule and a carrot , to be teased with possibilities never to be accomplished , and scorned into distinct oblivion by those you trust most 
just got All the Way Turned Up a remix of Turnt Up done by Ludacris 
Dont you just hate when people get in your business 
Ael . p -i try so hard- - Ael . p\ 
-i try so hard- 
at the moment a lot is pressing deeply onto my shoulders . i feel smothered by the weight i carry . whenever i finally let go for a while something happens to increase the pain . now i find ithard to even give a damn . 
i hate fake ppl
