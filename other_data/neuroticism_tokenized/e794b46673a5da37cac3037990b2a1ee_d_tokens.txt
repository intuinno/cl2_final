The worst thing is holding on to someone who doesn't want to be held on to . Don't fall for someone unless they're willing to catch you . The thing about falling in love is that if you do it right , you'll never hit the ground . Life ... is too short to be anything but happy . So kiss slowly . Love deeply . Forgive quickly . Ta ... ke chances & never have regrets

I see too many people who are trying to exercise in faith who do not have a relationship with God . The only time they come to God is when they are in dire need in perilous circumstances and they look to Him to get them out of the crises -- but they have not built the infrastructure of relationship up under their faith -- they are just using God because their in trouble .

What does it feel like\ 
Playing in the dirt\ 
Getting your hands dirty\ 
Because you're hurt\ 
Or simply playing dirty\ 
Because you can\ 
Negate your responsibilities\ 
Yet call yourself a WOMAN ..... 
Let me knw what you think :\ 
\ 
To what extent\ 
Would you go\ 
Out of your way\ 
To ruin\ 
To destroy\ 
To condemn\ 
A person who was once your friend\ 
Would you lie\ 
Create an alibi\ 
Deny the truth\ 
Say it wasn't you ........ to\ 
A person who was your lover\ 
Liars Cheat\ 
Cheaters steal\ 
Jealousy kills\ 
Do you care about your lover \ 
Remember\
