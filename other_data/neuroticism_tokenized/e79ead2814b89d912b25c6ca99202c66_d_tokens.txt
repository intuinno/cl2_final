Gotta bluejay feather for my hair ! :) 
It looks like I was right , you were just another waste of my time . 
This rain is awesome ! PAUSE NOT . I just hydroplaned around a turn on I-94 at like 70 < PROPMALE > an hour . :/ Aw lord , I think my heart may have stopped for a second . 
Only 10 1/2 hours through my 48 hour shift , & I already wish saturday would come faster ! Entertain me ? :) 
I am totally in love with my new client's cat ! She's a sphinx named < PROPFEMALE > & she is absolutely adorable . Aww , I know who I'll be cuddling with tonight . ( ; 
I'm < PROPFEMALE > bored . Almost 36 hours down , & only 12 hours left until I'm outta of work . :) Text me ? Entertainment is appreciated ! Message me for the number . <3 
Just got my ass kicked at some LASER TAG !!! woo :) 
“I knew that I had come face to face with some one whose mere personality was so fascinating that , if I allowed it to do so , it would absorb my whole nature , my whole soul , & my very < PROPMALE > itself . ” 
Ugh , everything just keeps getting worse . What in the hell brought all this on ? :/ 
Gettin ' fresh & going to make that almighty dollar . That's whats up . :) 
One of my client's is going to be moving into her new apartment soon , so I'm trying to round up some boxes to help her out . So if anyone in the area has any extra cardboard boxes layin ' around , please let me know . :) It would be greatly appreciated . 
Damaged people are dangerous . They know they can survive . 
Client in centerline @ 1 , then enjoying my last night of freedom before my 48 hour shift starts tomorrow morning . Anyone wanna chill later ? :) 
“In a closed society where everybody's guilty , the only crime is getting caught . \ - < PROPMALE > S . Thompson " 
Got the hookup on that wireless internet at my client's house this week . Chea ' boy ! :D 
Maybe you'll miss me when I'm gone , maybe you won't . But you're about to find out what saying goodbye feels like , cause I'm done wasting my time on you . 
Chea ' , gonna go spend some quality time shooting guns with my wonderful father < PROPMALE > Robarge tomorrow afternoon ! Now that's what I call father/daughter bonding . :) 
A Dr. Pepper just blew it's load all over the interior of my car . Fuckin ' sweet . 
Headed to the Robarge backyard shooting range for some R&R , haha . :) Gonna spend some quality time with my girl < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , my Daddybear , and the fam . 
Aw , my laptop just died on me . :( 
Found a decent laptop someone is selling for $50 . :) Going to my client's house , then cashing my check & going to pick that sucker up . 
Day 2 of trying to get the wireless internet working on my new laptop , & it's not going well . I even called AT&T and sat on the phone with tech support , just to have them tell me after like an hour that they couldn't figure out why it wouldn't work either . Anyone computer savvy wanna help a sister out ? :) 
Had a fun day off today . :) Did some craft store hoppin ' with < PROPFIRST > Aubel , pimped out my hula hoop , enjoyed a little sunshine , and got my new laptop working . Now it's time to kick back and do some relaxin ' 
Nothing enhances the flavor of french fries quite like bleeding profusely from the roof of your mouth . < PROPMALE > , I think we may have a problem . 
Ouch , this hoopin ' has got me hurtin ' in places I never even knew existed . :/ 
Workin ' that 48 hour shift , & makin ' that paper . Entertain me ! :) formspring.me/CynthiaJRobarge 
Outta work in T-minus 15 hours ! About to go smoke a squigarette , stretch , and do some hoopin ' in the garage to entertain myself for awhile . \ 
Text me , or leave me something to come back to . :) formspring.me/CynthiaJRobarge 
Munchin ' on some pizza & chillin ' with my little broskis . <3 
Ahh yes , I've got the whole day off . :) I'm lovin ' it . 
Right before the busiest day in my work-week , & the thunderbird decides it's going to start ticking like a goddamn bomb . But I have no idea why , cause it has oil in it . So , I guess I'm gonna have to fix this problem the simple way ; just crank that music up so I can't hear it tickin ' , & hope for the best . :) haha . 
My job put me in a very difficult situation this afternoon . Apparently privacy laws , and my personal opinion of what is right , are two things that cannot coexsist in my profession . To try and help would be overstepping my boundaries legally , so all I can do is be concerned . :( Gonna go for a run to clear my mind . 
< PROPMALE > Robarge <3 [ If your Dad is , or was , a hard working man , and is your hero , has helped you no matter how good or bad you were , and is just the best Dad ever ; if you are blessed to still have your Dad , or if he is in Heaven , paste this to your status and let everyone know you are proud of your Dad !!! ] I LOVE YOU DADDYBEAR ! :) 
Going to see my big brudder < PROPMALE > Brosowski , at the grand opening of his new shop Blackbeard Tattoo & Body Piercing . :) 
Makin ' that paper ! One client down , 2 clients to go . Then enjoying the rest of my day before I start my 48 hour shift tomorrow morning . :) 
Wow , I'm so glad I just drove all the way to cass and groesbeck for a 3 o'clock appt , just so my client could call at 2:58 and cancel on me . Gee , THANKS . :/ 
Who's got all 3 seasons of Boondocks to keep herself entertained with during her 48 hour shift this week ? I do ! Thanks demonoid . ( ; 
12 hours into my shift , 36 hours to go , and I'm already bored out of my mind . Anyone care to have some stimulating conversation ? :) \ 
Hit me up via facebook , formspring.me/cynthiajrobarge , send me a text , use telepathy , I don't care . Just ENTERTAIN ME please . 
I am in need of some new music . Any suggestions ? 
Just got outta my live-in job , another 48 hours down . :) Gettin ' fresh , and heading out to Centerline for an appointment with a client @ 12 , and then to < PROPMALE > Heights for another client @ 3 . After that it's time to hit up that Blackbeard Tattoo & Body Piercing Grand Reopening party for some good times ! Chea ' boy ! 
Boo , I burned 3/4ths of a tank of gas driving around for work today . Now I don't have enough gas to go to Port Huron for my brother's tattoo shop party tonight . :( gay . 
I guess since I obviously won't be sleeping tonight , it's about time for me to get up and do something productive . 
At a family BBQ ; doin ' some hoopin ' & enjoying the beautiful weather . What a nice end to my busy week . :) 
Finally got to spend some well-overdue chill time with my little cuz , < PROPFEMALE > MacGillivray . <3 Now I'm about to head up to Brandenburg park to sip on some Pabst . :) Day off tomorrow , anyone wanna < PROPFEMALE > out ? 
Sometimes you have to pick your battles , next time try giving me something to fight for . 
With my girl < PROPFIRST > Jmoneystank Pintoski for the night . :) 
Hey , you there ! Text me . :) I'm bored at work , and feeling pretty conversational . At this point even if I dislike you I would probably talk to you anyways . I really am that bored , so let's be friends . \ 
Or you can always hit me up via ; formspring.me/CynthiaJRobarge 
Just got offered more hours , for better pay , and less of a drive , from one of my homecare jobs . :) Unfortunately I had to quit my other job to get them , but at least I won't be putting 500 < PROPMALE > a week on my car anymore . 
I'm quickly learning that anytime multiple hula hoops are involved , I may need a helmet for as many times as I inadvertently smack myself in the head . Ouch . :/ 
My parents always told me that I could be whatever I wanted when I grew up ; Well , I decided to be an asshole . 
Aw , no Creeper Creep today . I guess I'll just have to head out to < PROPFEMALE > City to drink beer instead . :) 
Beer & fireworks with some good friends . I love nights like these . :) 
Turns out I've got tomorrow off too . :) That's FOUR days in a row . ' Chea . 
Going tanning & then heading out to meet my new client . Work 11-7 , & then packing for my 48 hour shift tomorrow . It's all about the Benjamins , baby ! :) 
I don't think < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > fully grasps the concept of a ' yes ' or ' no ' question . His stammering avoidance of a legitimate answer , combined with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST>'s weak defense ; is making this clusterfuck of a trial very entertaining . 
First day with my new client , & his son-in-law is already trying to hook me up with his HUGE lifted-truck drivin ' neighbor . Haha , it certainly didn't take him too long to figure me out , now did it ? :) 
Damn you left hand , why must you be entirely bereft of dexterity ? How frustrating . 
I swear , if my ex calls my phone one more time I'm gonna < PROPMALE > that motherfucker at the wall . Then I'm going to stomp on it , burn it , and throw it in the next door neighbor's pool . This is absolutely ridiculous . 
Where can a sista buy some grip tape ? 
If you ain't the bank teller , don't tell me nothin ' . 
What's good for tonight ? Let's go do somethin ' . :) 
Drankin ' some Pabst with my boys J3r & < PROPMALE > Chappelle . :) Happy 21st birthday < PROPFIRST > ! 
Last night ; while in a drunken stupor , I somehow managed to seriously fuck up my hand . I have no idea how I did it either . :/ Go me . 
St. < PROPFIRST > fireworks tonight . :) Who else is headin ' up there ? 
' I contend that we are both atheists . I just believe in one fewer god than you do . When you understand why you dismiss all of the other possible gods , you will understand why I dismiss yours . ' - < PROPFIRST > F . Roberts 
I just found out that for the next couple weeks my usual 48 hour shift is going to become a 72 hour shift . Ouch . :/ 
At work ; watching Judge < PROPFEMALE > with my client . Today is going by SO slow , & I'm absolutely bored out of my mind . Entertain me ? :) 8105808621 
... from all the way at the back of the food stamp line . 
Awh , this is my last night with my client . Boo :/ I really need to stop getting so attached to the people I take care of . 
Being able to actually fall asleep sometime tonight would be fucking outstanding . 
Gettin ' tatted by my big brother . :) 
Had a great time this weekend ! Got a tattoo , went jet-sking for the first time , shot some guns , & spent time with my favorite people ; all on only THREE hours of sleep . Laying down to do some relaxin ' tonight , & then tomorrow morning it's back to business & the crazy , hectic , week ahead of me . Text me , let's chat . ( ; 
Work 11-7 . It's gonna be a very long , very boring 8 hours . Feel free to keep me entertained ; texts would be greatly appreciated . :) 
Outta work early today ; lucky me . :) Gonna catch up on some things around the house , & then I'll be free for the evening . Hit me up if you wanna do something . 
Well , so much for my ' nap ' yesterday . I ended up crashing out for the night instead , so now it's 3 AM and I'm wide awake . 
It's only Tuesday , but I already can't wait for this week to be over . Hurry up Sunday , this girl needs a day off ! 
The neurologist's office ; is this not a perfectly reasonable place to take a nap ? 
At work ; with 2 hours down , & 70 hours left to go . Oh lord , what have I gotten myself into ? :/ Feel free to text me if you're bored , because I could certainly use the entertainment . I have a feeling it's going to be a VERY long 3 days . 
Add me on Google + , cynthiajrobarge@gmail.com :) 
Gonzo . :) I forgot how much I truely enjoy this book . 
Oh my , it's already un-godly hot outside . Yet the first thing my client says to me when I wake up is ' Let's turn off the air . ' :/ 
Reading my book until it's time to make dinner . 51 hours down , and only 21 hours left until I'm out of work . Yay ! Then I get to enjoy the next 2 days off . :) 
Finally out of work . :) Ahh yes . Sweet , sweet freedom . 
Frasier fireworks with my little cuz tonight . :) Hit me up if you'd like to join us . 
Just finished gettin ' my tat touched up . About to head out to < PROPFEMALE > City to give State Farm a bunch of my money , and then meeting up with my Daddy at < PROPMALE>'s Roadhouse for a brewski . :) 
I am truely appalled by the lack of importance that some people place on using good grammer , spelling , and punctuation on this website . Honestly , it's nearly painful to read some of the status updates that I see . 
To keep myself sane as I go into my incredibly boring 72 hour shift tomorrow , I am in need of some new reading material . Any suggestions ? 
Does anyone know who this bitch is , or why she's sending me derogatory messages for absolutely no reason ? \ 
< PROPFEMALE > Bucknavich :\ 
U need to delete Jaysin < PROPFIRST > off ur fb < PROPFEMALE > , aint u aint welcome to my 44 party . No bitches i dont know are going to that party ... so know that\ 
Dueces 
My client is having a ramp installed in front of her door today , and from the point when they pour the cement no one can come or go for a full 24 hours . That means I'll be kicking off the first day of my 72 hour shift without one single cigarette . Oh , lord help me . 
Does anyone have a copy of ' The wild & wonderful Whites of West < PROPFEMALE>' that I could borrow ? 
Great , so my boss just called & said that they were extending the case I'm currently working on by a few weeks . Now they don't want to give me next weekend off for my family reunion . I work 85+ hours a week for these people , and they can't cut me a break for 2 days ? What the hell ? 
Just finished ordering tickets , so I can take my beautiful best friend < PROPFIRST > Jmoneystank Pintoski to see Lil ' < PROPMALE > for her birfday . <3 Cheer up girl , I love you ! 
Sleepover with the lovely < PROPFIRST > Jmoneystank Pintoski . <3 Hands down , the best way to spend an evening . 
' Did you know that < PROPFEMALE > ranks the lowest in education , but the highest in drug use ? It's nice to be number 1 , but we can fix that . All we need to do is start a war on education . If it's anywhere near as successful as our war on drugs , we'll all be hooked on phonics in no time . ' - < PROPFEMALE > Lord 
T-minus 20 hours until my family reunion in < PROPMALE > ; with a celebrity appearance by my booski-boo < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > . I'm SO pumped ! :) 
Ew . Leave it to Glee to take a Lady Gaga song that's already gay as fuck , and make it even gayer . I think I liked it more when my client just stuck to her game shows and infomercials . :/ 
Dear bitch who's supposed to be relieving me from my shift ; WHAT DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND ABOUT 9AM ?! Do I need to translate that into ebonics for you ? Some of us have shit to do today . 
My case ended early ; so it looks like my thursday , friday , saturday , sunday , & monday just opened up . :) That's 5 whole days , SCORE ! Hit me up if you'd like to chill while I've got some time off . 
The Maury show is a perfect example of why stupid people shouldn't reproduce . :/ 
Hooping the day away , with my love < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Pintoski <3 :) 
Hey , whoever threw my muscle relaxers away ; I REALLY hate you , & so does my back . :/ 
Uh-oh , I think I may have to change my Mom's boyfriends nickname from ' Uncle Buzz ' , to ' Sherlock Holmes ' . :/ 
' Chea boyy . :) \

My car is so ghetto that I have to turn on both my panic lights , and my right turn signal to make my lights flash . Haha , wow . 
Broken down on the side of I-94 for the SECOND time today . :/ Fucking outstanding . 
I am extremely dissapointed by the fact that ( according to Fox News ) Eminem is now considered the ' < PROPMALE > of Hip-hop ' . Ew . Really ? 
This Thursday begins my last 4 days of freedom before I start working 85+ hours a week again . Text me if you'd like to make plans to chill before that happens . :) 
Whaaat ?! The government has been sterilizing people that they feel are ' undesirable ' candidates for having children ? I'm not even sure what to say about that . 
Snuggled up wif ' my puppy , watching Takers . :) 
T-minus 7.5 hours ' til I'll be hittin ' up the Lil < PROPMALE > concert , with my booski-boo < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Pintoski ! :) Seeing my favorite rapper in the world , with my favorite girl in the world ? Sounds like a wonderful evening to me . 
Don't speak , just listen . 
I just got hit on by Rack ' em < PROPMALE>'s four-toothed , meth-mouthed twin at a gas station in Eastpointe . :/ Oh , how romantic . 
Leaving for my 48 hour shift in T-minus 1 hour ; and it will undoubtedly be 48 hours of extreme boredom . Feel free to text me , because I would love some entertainment . :) Message me if you need the number . 
How on earth did my dog manage to poop in my work shoe ? \ 
And beyond that , how in the hell didn't I notice it when I was getting ready for work this morning ? :/ 
I'm in desperate need of entertainment . \ 
So , for every person that likes this I will answer one of the following super-gay questions : \ 
1 . My relationship status . \ 
2 . My addiction . \ 
3 . My bestfriends . \ 
4 . Who makes me laugh . \ 
5 . Someone cute who liked my status . \ 
6 . Someone I truly trust . \ 
7 . Someone I do the craziest stuff with . \ 
8 . Someone I tell everything to . \ 
9 . One confession . \ 
10 . Someone I miss . \ 
11 . Someone who understands me the most . \ 
12 . Someone I want back in my life . \ 
13 . My biggest fear . \ 
GO ! 
I have a migraine so bad that it feels like someone is repeatedly stabbing me in the temples with an ice-pick . On top of that my ears are ringing , AND I'm shaking like a fiending alcoholic . Wonderful . I'm starting to think that trying to ' sleep this off ' may not be a plausible solution . 
Another 48 hour shift DOWN . Dolla ' dolla ' < PROPMALE > ya'll! :) Now I'm off to enjoy the rest of my weekend , entirely work free . 
MOLLY . OLLIE . OXENFREE ! :) 
Thank god for Xanax !

About to do some yoga , and contortion stretches . Then read my book , & get my sleep on . :) Text it ? 810.580.8621 
I've been so nauseous for the last 2 days that the only thing I've been able to eat is a half-bottle of Pepto Bismol . Outstanding . 
Ew , I'm pretty sure < PROPMALE > the spider took a big ol ' bite outta my cheek last night . :/ Try it while I'm awake next time , you eight-legged asshole . 
Haha , < PROPFIRST > Crowley loved watching me jam my septum ring through my nose , after having had it out for about a year and a half . \ 
\Aw 
Happy Birthday to my wonderful father < PROPMALE > Robarge , who , less than an hour into his birthday , was already COMPLETELY wasted . That's going for the gold , Daddy ! :) \ 
I love you . <3 
Just downloaded ' I drink for a reason ' , ' Assholes finish first ' , and the entire < PROPMALE > S . Thompson collection on the Kindle . I'm SO excited . :) I don't think I'll ever have to leave my house again . 
Bored at work . \ 
Ask me something ! \ 
http://www.formspring.me/CynthiaJRobarge 
I am SO fed up with being sick all the time , and on top of that , having to deal with ignorant people that just can't comprehend that there is , in fact , something legitimately wrong with me . If I had a dollar for every asshole that has told me ' At 21 years old , you can't possibly have that many health problems . ' it would more than pay for the overabundance of medication that ' I'm too young to be on anyways . ' 
Is anybody else having trouble with Demonoid ? 
Somebody please make me feel better . I'm just so sick of being sick . :( 
Goal for the day : Make myself feel good enough that I can go outside and do some hoopin ' , for the first time in almost a month . GO ! :) 
Had a wonderful day today ! After 4 weeks of being miserably sick , with 2 trips to the ER , I'm finally feeling SO much better . :) I got to spend some quality time with my wonderful father < PROPMALE > Robarge , < PROPFIRST > Gainer , and my love < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > Pintoski . <3 
At work , reading my absolute favorite childhood book : The Thief of Always . <3 Text it ? 
Why does the last hour of work always feel like the longest ? 
Add me on Skype- CynthiaJacqueline <3 
Turn your wounds into wisdom . 
Anybody know where I can find a cheap 2 bedroom apartment for about $500 a month ? 
Really appreciating how far I've actually come in the 3 years since I've graduated . Maybe I haven't made as much progress as I originally would have liked to , but I've overcome obstacles I never even knew existed , and I've come out doing better than I would have imagined . Here's to always continuing to improve myself , and looking ahead to bigger , better things . :) 
Had a wonderful evening with < PROPFIRST > , & the Brians last night . :) Now I'm gettin ' cute , and then heading off to work for a few hours . 
I saw the best bumper sticker on my way to work this morning . It may be a few years too late , but it said ; ' Save the environment , plant a Bush back in Texas . ' Haha . :) 
A fat black woman just drove past my client's house , bumpin ' ' White Power ' by D . H . T . \ 
It was like a real-life < PROPMALE > Chappelle skit . 
UGH ! Mental note :\ 
Surgical steel = Epic septum stank :/ 
It's about time to be changin ' over , add me on Google + :\

\Michigan senate approves abortion procedure ban . \ " \ 
The only thing that pisses me off worse than seeing those stupid white stick people on the back windshield of somebody's vehicle , is having to do 10mph under the speed limit because the asshole driving said vehicle is too busy talking on their cellphone to look at the speedometer . 
Ugh . Work schedule for the next 4 days :\ 
-I arrived at work at 9 a.m. this morning , I will work 48 hours and get out at 9 a.m. Saturday . \ 
-I will have exactly 24 hours off work from 9 a.m. Saturday , to 9 a.m. Sunday . \ 
-Sunday , I will arrive at work at 9 a.m. , work 48 hours , & get out at 9 a.m. Tuesday . \ 
-When I get out of work Tuesday I have exactly 1 hour to get to my next shift , and then work 10-6 . \ 
That means that I will have worked roughly 112 hours this week . I think this more than puts me at ' workaholic ' status . 
Rest in peace , < PROPFIRST > . :/ 
Shower , then trying to make 50lbs of clothes fit into a 10lb closet . Ugh . This should be fun . 
:( 
' I love you ' is eight letters long . Then again , so is ' bullshit ' . 
Just discovered that I have the ability to : with my hands handcuffed behind my back , bring my arms under my butt & legs , over my feet and back into the front of my body . Not sure how much good it will do me in the long run , but it is pretty nifty . :) 
Some dumbass standing outside of the courthouse for the Dr. < PROPMALE > trial is holding up a sign that says ; ' The Illuminati killed < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE >.' Seriously , what the fuck ? 
Packing for my 24 hour shift , then going to < PROPFEMALE > out with my wonderful boyfriend for the night . :) 
In need of humorous reading material . Any suggestions ?
