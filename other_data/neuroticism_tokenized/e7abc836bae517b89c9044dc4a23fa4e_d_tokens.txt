wrapping my mind around this move to Manhattan ... 

I saw one of my favorite high school teachers today ... I don't think she remembered me ... 
fasting for balance 
I have broken my fast , after three days . I think I accomplished what I needed ... 
is leaving < PROPFEMALE > behind again in 7 days ... New town , new adventure 
Braves lost ... but at least I discovered that there is another side of baseball ... a side with air conditioning and waiters and all you can eat buffets ... who knew 
My last day in < PROPFEMALE > 
Gearing for this 15 hour drive ... 
just attended my first orientation at Columbia . 
just auditioned for lessons/chamber groups at Columbia ... they said I did well ... they also said no lessons for grad students ... we'll work it out though 
Another audition down :-) 
The Black Jacobins :-) 
Hello Central , give me Doctor Jazz 
Apparently , my neighbor is some violinist with insomnia ... one who is working very hard to get these 3 squeaky notes right ... stay the course neighbor ... I feel your struggle 
going to go see < PROPFEMALE > Angelou speak tomorrow :-) 
I'm concerned about these facebook viruses bouncing around ... could lead to some interesting rumors .... 
1:48 am It sounds like one of my neighbors is trying to genetically fuse a violin with an angry pregnant cat 
Who wants to help me move ? 
Made it down to the Sugar Hill Gang concert . I was worried there for a minute . Can Not Wait til it gets started . For all my people who know all the words to rapper's delight , unabridged 
I'm up working on a big assignment and jstor just blocked my IP address because they say I'm accessing the site so much that it seems suspicious ...
