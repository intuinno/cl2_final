I will tell you what I like , dislike and my first impression of you , if you like this status . 
Children with special needs don't have an illness , so there is no cure and it's \ 
not contagious . They want what we all want - to be accepted . Most of you\ 
probably won't copy and paste this , but will you do it and leave it on \ 
your status for at least an hour ? It's special education week , and this is in honor of all the kids who need a little extra help\ 
and understanding .
