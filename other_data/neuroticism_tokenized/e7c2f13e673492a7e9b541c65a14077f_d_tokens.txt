THIS IS NORMAL ! I'm not gonna go off myself or anything . I'm just a giant Buzz Kill . thanks for your concer , but this is normal for me .

I'm looking for some 18 to almost 18 year old actresses to play some Zombie nurses in an upcoming horror movie ! there are two spots to fill , but there's some stabbing with knives and syringes and stuff so that's cool . BUT the only catch , is that there's some kinda provacative stuff that goes on , and they'd have to be willing to be a little awkward for a scene or two . nothing serious , but still . 
I hate taxes ... I'm so tired right now , but it needs done . oh well . lol . Tax times is serious times D=<

Does anybody have a Game Boy Advance that they arn't using anymore ? Cuz I really want one .... soooo .... hit me up if you got one ! =D \ 
P.S. Medabots Rule ! 
So ... I'm car-less now . it really sucks lol . So I'm looking for a new one now . not much else going on in my life . haha 
I have three bugbites on my shoulder arranged in a perfect triangle ... I'm starting to think I'm the chosen one 
just found out that the only thing standing in the way of me and releasing my music will only cost me about $50 . that means that if I can make a worthy album , I only have to sell 10 at $5 a copy to make my money back ! =D 
yuck ! now I remeber why I quit smoking ! XD lol but on the bright side , I've got a delicious slurpee right now ! lol 
Soo .... I'm thinking a new tattoo . =D haha . maybe even some branding . and possibly a peircing . yeah ... I'm kind of a mess right now ! XD haha 
So we're back to this again . lol . Anyone Got a Gameboy Advance that they arn't using anymore ? cuz I'd like one . lol 
So , I'm almost convinced that I know what tattoo I want , but there's just so many little things that I can't make up my mind on ! lol SO many cool ideas .... hahaha 
Soooo , I think I'm off to go get my new tattoo ... =D \ 
Pics up soon I guess ! lolz . \

Sooo .... My tattoo is gonna be amazingly EPIC !!! just saying ! < PROPMALE > does Beautifull work , and I'm SO excited to get this done ! since < PROPMALE > isn't done working on the design , I've had to improvise on the design . look at it in my pictures ! XD 
so , I'm SOOO Excited to actually get my tattoo done =) won't be for a while though , but OMG !!! if only you could see it ! hahaha 
OMG !!! I need to be SAVING money ! haha . I'm looking at a $300+ tattoo , AND I just found something I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT !!! omg , I found a physical Tarot deck with artwork based off of Baroque !!! ugh !! lol I think that's a justified $75 , don't you think ?! lol 
Why is everyone posting song lyrics in their status tonight ?! \ 
She's got a date at midnight with Nosferatu . Oh , baby , < PROPFEMALE > Munster ain't got nothing on you ! 
So , at least a week and a half untill my new tattoo . that's okay . I can wait . Have you ever had one of those times when you don't really feel like living ... but you don't really feel like dying either ? cuz that's kind of how i feel 
So , I'm completely obsessed with Baroque again . I LOVE talking about the story line in public places , cuz if anyone overhears , they probobly think we're part of a cult ! It's AWESOME ! XD hahahaha 
Oh my god ... I think I'm gonna die . not in a good way . I'm going to see The Birthday Massacre , but they're coming with Otep , Beneath the Sky , and The Agonist . Birthday massacre is SO the odd man out . I'm going to a mainly screamo event to see a rather ambiant gothy band ... what the fuck ?! 
okay . I'm off . I hate people WAY too much to be sitting on facebook right now . Whatever . Maybe I'll be on later tonight , but as for now , I'll see you idiots later 
Death certainly makes you think about life . but whatever . that's all deep and crap . I'm just in the mood to waste away listening to music . Peace out 
I'm on the outside , I'm lookin ' in . I can see through you , see your true colors . Cuz Inside you're ugly . Ugly like me . I can see through you , see to the real you .... 
I'm SO excited to get my new tattoo ! Hopefully on saturday ! Ahhh ! lol It's gonna be awesome . but I just need to decide weather I want to do full color , or a cool grey scale ( black , grey , white ) and red ! =) \ 
hmmm ? 
Alright !!! Twelve hours from now I'm gonna be getting all Inked up ! lol I'm gettin ' my tattoo at 12:30 today , so I'm gonna be a little sore but SUPER excited for the rest of the day ! haha Ahhhh ! I'm < PROPFEMALE > excited ! 
Well , I'm off to go get my second Tattoo ! I'll hopefully have pictures up soon ! haha Wish me luck . this is gonna be long and painful ! XD like , 70% of it is right on the bone ! haha 
Soooo ... my new tattoo is freakin ' amazing ! < PROPMALE > packed SO much detail into it ! =) I LOVE it ! gotta go back in in a few months and get it touched up and finished , but it's still amazing as it is ! =D yaay ! lol . Pics up soon ! 
The Birthday Massacre was AMAZING !!! I love how they weren't even the headliner , but they were still the life of the show ! hahahah OMG ! Chibi flashed me a little heart with her hands a few times ! =D yeah , I was pretty much geeking out ! lol 
Bleh ! i'm just so cynical right now . meh . well , I'm working today and tomorrow , and I'm probobly gonna get my tattoo finished up in a couple days . so we'll see I guess . whatever . keep voting for those of you that are 
So I spent forever trying to get something nice for Ash's Birthday , but I failed . Miserably . It kind of issued a big fat \F-You Earl\ " at me . So that sucked .... BUT I was able to download a couple songs from the original Baroque and I found out one of my new skirts has a pocket !!! =) So it's not all bad " 
< PROPMALE > Pippert is one cool kid . Just sayin ' 
Frikkin ' Idiots ! D:< 
OKay , it's official . Myspace officially sucks testicles . 
I got some amazing new instruments for my industrial music ! as I'm typing this , I'm writing this beautiful ambiant industrial peice . it's got some soothing strings backed by the harsh drums . it's strange ... but lovely . =) 
I wish technology wasn't so retarded .... I'm trying to export some stuff to put on my band < PROPFEMALE > , but it's only doing the drums , so the spooky awesome strings aren't coming though .... D ' : so sad ..... 
Every time I look in your eyes , I get that feeling inside . Every time I think of you , I feel so very strange . Every time I see your face , I know just what I want . Every time I look in your eyes , you make me want to die . 
So I've got some awesome new music demos , a new car , and a roll in an upcoming movie ! hot damn ! lol things seem to be doing pretty well ! XD 
So I think I want to make a line of stuffed dolls based off the < PROPMALE > arcana of the Tarot . I've drawn some scetches and they're starting to look soooo cute ! lol . maybe I'll make one and see if it's worth the effort ! lol . hand stitching takes time 
If I were to make some < PROPFEMALE > Wing t-shirts , would anyone want one ? 
The first < PROPFEMALE > Wing t-shirt is finished , and I don't mean to brag , but it's preeeety sweet ! =) I'm so excited to wear it tomorrow ! haha hopefully there should be some for sale soon ! 
really feels like he needs to take the advice of The Hanged Man . I'm just too caught up in everything to enjoy anything right now . I just need to go and do just because I can . Ugh .... maybe I'll climb a tree tomorrow ... 
Know what my favorite thing about religion is ? How easy it is to find loop holes that just make me hate people even more . 
Aaaahhhh !!!! I'm writing lyrics , and it's turing out really good so far ! D= I'm almost done , but I'm not sure what to write ! lol hahah\ 
but hopefully I'll have a new song ready soon ! =) 
Hey there facebook-friends ! I just wanted to let anyone who's interested know that < PROPFEMALE > Wing t-shirts with unique , one of a kind designs are available upon request ! just send me a message for more info ! =) 
I got jipped ! I bought a 14 gauge barbell with these really awesome spikes on it , but when I took the spikes off , the end of the barbell was taperd to a 16 gauge , so I can't use the spikes at all ! 
Holy crap . How hard is it to find a freakin ' floppity two-tone Jester cap ?! 
< PROPFEMALE > needs to make up her mind ! All she ever talks about is wanting to become one with me , but when I give her my Idea Sephera , she freaks out and admits she's too scared to go through with it . Geez ... Women .... 
Know what it's time for ? Writing music ! That's what it's time for . I'm thinking some moody synth bass . you know , that super cool detuned legato that does the lowpitch slide that sounds super awesome ? yeah . that's what I'm thinking 
Please put this as your status if you know or are related to someone killed on Alderaan when it was obliterated by the Death < PROPFEMALE > . My wish is that people will understand that the Empire is a band of murdering scum . The Rebel Alliance wants to bring peace to the galaxy , but the Galactic Empire continues to kill innocent civilians . Will ... YOU make this your status for at least one hour and support the cause ? 
I discovered my personal Baroque today : \People are filth . \ " Now all that's left is the destortion ... hm ... " 
< PROPFEMALE > , your right ... I DO have a problem .... but on the bright side , I got some really cool black and red dice ! =D 
So far so good , I guess . I took a forty-one card started deck , then used my booster packs to beef it up to the 60 card minimum limit . This Red Black deck is faring pretty well against my White Blue deck . best two out of tree , next match is the tie braker ! 
The Birthday Massacre is coming back to Portland !!!! XD I'm soooo excited ! sure , they may be coming with BVB , but whatever . I'll gladly stomp on some trashy 14 year olds just to get close to the stage when Birthday Massacre plays ! P.S. Dommin's gonna be there too 
don't you love finding out that hours of your life were wasted for nothing ..... cuz I don't 
\who am I ? \ " \ " you're a jerk . \ " \ " who are you ? \ " \ " I'm a jerk . \ " \ " We're perfect for each other ! \ " \ " Quit picking your nipple and hug me ! \ " \ " What ?! I'm not ! \"" 
I love The Birthday Massacre soooo much ! Their show was AMAZING ! such a great night , despite Black Veil Douchebags . Hm ... I hope Chibi found the < PROPFEMALE > we left for them .... =D 
When I said \I wanna do something that makes today feel worthwhile\ " I didn't mean getting pulled over .... " 
I don't think I've EVER had to execute five consecutive eye rolls just to come close to the appropriate intensity that was required for such a rediculous statement untill yesterday ..... 
\Here comes the Thnikka maaaan ! \ " \ 
I have reason to belive that Eluveitie is one of the best bands on the planet . 
YEAHH !!! AGAIN ! XD I've FINNALY figured out how to use the rest of the Drumatic Drum < PROPFEMALE > ! hahaha I only hat one < PROPMALE > at first , but now I can use the whole damn set ! XD 
Happy Birthday < PROPFEMALE > =( 
I HATE Christmas shopping . But I did have a good day with my Bug ! =D so I guess it's not a complete waste ! haha 
I know I've got a problem , But Magic is just SOOOooo fun ! =) and it's addicting . I just gotta keep buying more boosterpacks ! lol but hey , it payed off ! I got two Mythic-Rare cards and a holographic card ! =) yay 
\There's a flying hooker watching you hug ....... goaway hooker ! \"" 
Hill House seems so long ago .... =(

wow .... I JUST woke up . haha\ 
long night last night 
\I Don't know what .... Rhubarb .... IIIIIIIIIIISSSSSSSSSSS\ " * sob sob sob * " 
Why is Christmas always in need of saving ? Anyone else think it's odd that Christmas is ALWAYS in peril ? You never seen anyone trying to steal Halloween . Sure you get your obnoxious christians , but it's just not the same . hahaha Maybe I'll make a Halloween special where I save Halloween for everyone =D 
Thank < PROPFEMALE > I don't have to work tomorrow ! hahaha I'm DEFFINATELY ready for a break . but it's all good . 
Khara < PROPFEMALE > ! Khara Rath Amah !!!! 
Ugh ... not so sure how I feel about today ... 
Today was ... interesting . but over all I think it was a good day . now I'm sitting here listening to Devil Music and wallowing in my one thoughts ... < PROPFEMALE > Christmas Ev ... 
Wow ! What a crazy night last night ! to make a long story short : I ended up traveling to the North Pole and had to Save Chrsitmas ! It was crazy business , but Got it done for all y'all . Your welcome . and Am I gonna get a christmas special about it ? I don't think so >=\\ well whatever ... merry Giftmas errehbuddeh 
Spooky Half steps < PROPFIRST > by awesome syth instraments backed by crazy double kicks !? What is this music coming to ? Pure Awesome . What's what . 
Mormons .... I was attacked ... by MORMONS ! WTF ! Here I am just trying to pay my freaking car insurance and these MORMONS knock on the door ! I didn't even know we had any of those arround here ! God , and I was too stressed out to mess with them any ... damn . today sucks 
Well , Yesterday Deffinately got better . It was kind of stressful , but all in all it had a pretty good ending . I made a phenominal Necromantic Magic Deck and watched Lord of The Rings : The Return of the < PROPMALE > . =) good times 
I almost got stuck behind the same train TWICE on the way home from work . and that was after already sitting and waiting for almost 15 minutes ! haha 
Once upon a time there was a little Necromancer named Ev . He was very lonley because he didn't have any friends . No one wanted to be his friend because he was far too scary . This made Ev sad , so one day he dicided to make himself an undead friend . But the zombie wouldn't play with him either . it just wandered arround killing people . This made Ev even more sad because Dead don't make good friends . So he died alone . =] 
I don't know why , but I've seriously been considering writing a play . =) How cool would that be if I ended up a famous Playwrite ?! 
Playwrighting times is serious times ! >=| lol\ 
I hope it turns out as good as I imagine it ! 
Me : I wanna bite your lip off ! \ 
Kirstin : I kinda need that to kiss you with\ 
Me : But If it's in my tummy you'll be kissing my insides ! =D \ 
Kirstin : Only until you poop >=| \ 
lmfao 
So I'm working on a song that sounds like soemthing the Birthday Massacre would write ! =] I think it's spiffy ! lol 
No , Computer . I know what I'm trying to type . This is MY play . stop trying to help 
The Boys Next Door is on TV . I'm not happy about it . Sure it's got < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > , but know who it DOESN'T have ?! < PROPMALE > McDonald , Braden Pippert , < PROPFIRST > Griffiths , and < PROPMALE > Smith ! Unless it has those guys , I'm not interested ! 
So , my play is coming along great ! It is one of the strangest tales ever told . It deals with the two great misteries of creation . Life and death . I think it will thrill you . It may shock you . It might even ... horrify you . =] lol 
I thought my Frankenstein reference was cute ...... 
Loves < PROPFEMALE > vury vury vury much ! :D 
yumm ! Icecream and Songwriting !
