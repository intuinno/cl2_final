What a LOOOONNNNG Weekend ! < PROPFIRST > had a track tournament all day Saturday in the Texas Heat . He placed 2nd in the 110 Hurdles . He is finding out that being 1st in District doesn't make him the fastest Hurdler in the State of Texas . He had a Bass Fishi 

< PROPFEMALE > left today for a Leadership Conference at San < PROPFIRST > State . She will be gone all week . I don't know what I am going to do without her when she graduates and goes to college next year . 
Zac just moved into an apartment and will start classes at < PROPFEMALE > College in July . I am really proud of him . 
It was 106 degrees in Giddings , Texas yesterday . This was < PROPFIRST>'s last qualifying meet for regionals . He placed 3rd in the 110M Hurdles and 5th in the Long Jump . He placed dead last in the final heat of the 400M Hurdles . He didn't compete in pole vau 
< PROPFEMALE > is back home from San < PROPFIRST > State and went off to Drill Team Camp today . She gave a speech on Free Enterprise and has qualified to compete in San < PROPFIRST > in October with it . As soon as she returns from Camp on Thursday , we have to do final fitt 
What a long 3 weeks !!! Parades , Pageants , Fishing Tournaments , Drill Team Camps , Track and Field Meets , Getting mom ready to go to Jylene's for the rest of the summer . 
In a nutshell : The parades were hot . < PROPFIRST > caught a 7.21 pound Bass at one of his last 3 tournament , took the tournament and won big Bass . < PROPFEMALE > did not place in the beauty pageant but she did wonderfully and she was beautiful . < PROPFIRST > made it all t 
The boys ( < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > ) left for Lake Fork this morning at 5 a . m . They will be there all week fishing . I miss them already . 
< PROPFIRST > had his largest catch ever today on Lake Fork . He caught 7 fish between 4 and 6 pounds each . < PROPMALE > had to whole day to fish by himself since the younger boys went out with Professional Guides today . < PROPFEMALE > and I are off to see The Hurt Locker in Harker Heights . It's our girls night out before the boys come home tomorrow . 
My Toyota no longer has a front bumper . :-( For more information and details , just ask < PROPFEMALE > . 
We are headed to Colorado Bend State Park to hike to the Falls and do some caveing . 
School Shopping !!! It's tax free weekend .... < PROPFEMALE > loves to shop and < PROPFIRST > will go only because he doesn't want me to buy him pink and purple school supplies ! 
First Day of School update . They left early . < PROPFEMALE > forgot her drill team stetson and had to go back home to get it . It took her a half hour to get into the parking lot at the new school after she dropped < PROPFIRST > off . The lunch people were not prepared for a closed campus turn out ( Hello ! Closed Campus was a hint ) , so < PROPFEMALE > did not make it through the lunch line before it was time for her next class . 
I am waiting for the update from the rest of the day when they get home . They are still at drill team and football practice . I forgot one thing . They have < PROPMALE > in College English and Government which she already took this summer at CTC . 
Zac has a phone number now !!! Grandma , Jyl , Landen , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , Emily .... Give Him a Call . He could really use your support and love . He's doing well in College but he misses his family . His number is 254 563 4400 . 
Today I attended a Women's Equality Day Luncheon . I had the opportunity to meet General < PROPFEMALE > Dunwoody . She is the first woman in the U.S. Military to achieve the rank of Four < PROPFEMALE > General . She is the commanding general of the U.S. Army Material Comand ; 65,000 soldiers strong . Even though I am usually a cynic at heart , she was impressive ! 
First day of < PROPFIRST>'s football season ! I hate football , I love watching his games ! My boy ran 32 yards for the first touch down of the season ! Way to go ! He's #29 this year . Primary positions are Running Back and Outside Lineman . Secondary positions are fullback and Z-back .. Whatever the heck that is . BTW , we won ! Pics are uploaded ! Isn't he cute in the endzone ? He even waved at his mom like he's supposed to . 
To heck with cleaning the house !! I finally have two consecutive days off , so I'll do it tomorrow .... How's that for procrastination . Off to the lake we go ! Fishing , Tubing , and fun ! 
I've posted pics of < PROPFIRST > . He had a football game yesterday on his Birthday . He got munched severely intercepting a pass . It was horrible to watch ! Needless to say , it's just his ankle . Possible fracture , tendons and ligaments . We will know more in 2 weeks . He didn't get a birthday cake , so he got a HUGE sundae today . 
just as I pull the remainder of the line outta the water without the reel . Priceless ! It's in 20 feet of water and no < PROPMALE > of retrieving it without scuba gear ..... I will never buy an American Rodsmith < PROPMALE > again !! And , I probably won't own a Quantum PT Energy baitcaster reel again either . Bad < PROPFEMALE > ! Then < PROPFIRST > pops off and says \A bad day of fishing is a better than a good day at work !! He almost went for a swim . " 
We are home safe and sound . Fort Hood is no longer on lock down . It took forever to get off Fort Hood ! We had to show ID and be searched to get off post . All those poor soldiers out there in full battle gear with their M-16's , manning the gates . 
This guy was on a radar but apparently not the right one ! This morning he was giving away items from his apartment to neighbors , as well as copies of the Koran ( sp ? ) and no one thought that was a little funny ??? He also lodged a complaint with KPD 2 days ago because some carved Allah on something he owned . 
He wasn't happy with KPD's response . He received a poor performance rating at < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > before he transferred here . Haven't heard the timeline on his conversion to Islam but he was born in < PROPFEMALE > . There are also reports of internet communications in the last 6 months regarding bombs and suicide . 
Fort Hood is observing a moment of silence at 1:35 Central Time . Please join us ! 
Happy Thanksgiving Everyone !! 
RE : Sending a Holiday Card to Wounded Soldiers . According to snopes.com that is not a good address as < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > insists on a name . A good address to send a card to is : Holiday Mail For Heros , PO Box 5456 , Capitol Heights , MD 20791-5456 
GO ARMY !!! 
iT'S A VERY SAD DAY !! 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas Y'all ... May all your holiday wishes come true ! We are so happy to be with family in Idaho for a White Christmas . Even thoughit appears , we could have had a White Christmas in Texas this year .... LOL 
I make mistakes , I am out of control and at times hard to handle . But if you can't handle me at my worst , then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best ! 
Whatever you give a woman , she will make greater . Give her sperm , she will make a baby ; give her a house , she will give you a home ; give her groceries , she will give you a meal ; give her a smile , she will give you her heart . She multiplies and enlarges what she is given . So , if you give her any crap , be ready to receive a ton of shit ! Pass it along if you agree 
Woot , Woot !!!! Just got home from < PROPFIRST>'s first track meet in Marble Falls ! He came home with 5 gold medals . He placed first in the 110 Hurdles , Long Jump , Pole Vault , 400 Meter Dash and the 1600 Meter Relay . He scored 30 points towards the team standings and almost broke 2 school records . It was great fun but soooooo cold !!! Good Job , son ! 
SO TIRED !! The kids showed at the < PROPMALE > Livestock Show Yesterday . We left the house at midnight , arrived at 3:30 in the morning . There were at least 200 vehicles ahead of us at the gate . Checked in at 4:40 . The sift started at 6:00 a.m. They both made it through 3 rounds before being eliminated at 5:00 p.m. I have never been so glad for them to lose in my life . Hopefully they placed in the top 100 out of 2000 
Got to watch the paint show in between the kids showing yesterday . I have never seen a ring full of more beautiful horses in my life . I am sure some of them would fetch $ 20,000 . 00 or more . They were amazing to watch . Off to the Stock show for more fun !!! No rodeo and concert this year . < PROPMALE > & Dunn's final concert tickets were wayyyy to much x 6 of us . LOL Staybridge 2 bedroom suites are lovely !!! 
Whew !!! What a month !! State Championship Bass Fishing Tournament , < PROPMALE > Stock Show and District Track meet finally behind us . Now we have College Drill Team Tryouts and Graduation to focus on ....... 
Family and friends , Here's the rundown on the District Track tournament : < PROPFIRST > is the District Champ in 110 M Hurdles for the 2nd year and also Pole Vault . He placed 2nd in Long Jump , 3rd in the 400 Meter Sprint Relay and his team took the Championship in the Mile Relay , and broke the school record . He broke the school record in the pole vault earlier in the season . The mile relay was awesome !!! 
For the record my family : I am fine !! I did NOT overdo it and I extremely dislike the conspiracy you have concocted to keep me in the hopsital to REST !! I can do that at home . The blood clot was not due to anything I did . It was a fluke and it sometimes happens after surgery . I want to go home ... Now that I've had my hissy fit , I feel better . Good Night !.... Love you anyway !!! 
Going to see ZZ Top !!!! 
< PROPFEMALE > is now a member of < PROPFEMALE > Valley College Cardettes Drill Team . I am proud of her . Her audition practices went very well ! She rolled her ankle during her russian axle turn but recovered stupendously for a strong finish ! She has a summer full of camps before college starts . The Team will be touring the Mediterranean in the spring and putting on performances for various military posts . I can't wait ! 
ALSO ..... We are behind in mailing out graduation annoucements and my list of addresses are pathetic . If you would like one , please e-mail me your address ... Thanks ! \ 
I believe we have almost everyone's in Texas and you should be receiving < PROPFEMALE>'s and < PROPFEMALE>'s announcements or have them today or tomorrow .... 
What a whirlwind the last month has been ! Worked overtime , chaired the company picnic for 400 , attended end of the school year banquets , programs , awards , attended graduation for our 2 daughters back to back , and went TDY to Pennsylvania last week . I hope the rest of June is slower , since July and August are already full . 
Getting Ready to have our annual 4th of July , Low Country ( < PROPFEMALE > Style ) Throwdown ! Lots of sausage , taters , corn , shrimp and crawfish . Later , we plan to blow some \stuff\ " up . I have the burn cream waiting for you < PROPFIRST > . Happy 4th Everyone and God Bless our Troops ! God Speed and come home safe and soon ..... " 
Of all the interstates in the US , I despise I-10 the most ..... 
So much for leaving Arizona early Wednesday morning\ 
.... 
Football .... I hate/love football . Last night's game was awesome !! My son < PROPFIRST > was awesome !! One touchdown and I don't know how many yards he carried ... a bunch . He had some great defensive tackles and immediate shutdowns . I know that's not a proper football term but it fits . Go Badgers !! I hope the Varsity does as well tonight . 
It's all fun and games until the boat catches on fire ..... :( 
It's raining ....... again . I now have lakefront property . LOL 
Football sucks ! < PROPFIRST > ran over 40 yards for a touch down , gained a bunch of yardage before the half and then got steamrolled right at the halftime buzzer ..... On our way to the ER . 
Where were you when the world stopped turning ? \ 
\ 
Metroplex hospital with my sister , < PROPFEMALE > . 
Loving my new sewing machine !!! The automatic threader is awesome !! 
The Boys of Fall played last night and tonight ! Freshmen and JV won their games . Good Luck Varsity in your Homecoming Game tonight . As for My Boy , you are in deep ! @#$% for not taking care of that arm .... But I still love you ! 
Does any of my < PROPFIRST > area FB friends have a copy of this morning's < PROPFIRST > Morning News ? If so , please save the front < PROPFEMALE > for me . My daughter's picture's on it 
TVCC got robbed tonight !! Cardinals took possession of the ball with 55 seconds left in the game . Had a couple of good plays then a long pass down field . Cardinals caught it in the end zone and < PROPFIRST > pushed the receiver back out of the end zone . The refs decided they were 2 yards shy of the touch down that would have won the game ... and what about the < PROPFIRST > players that came onto the field before the buzzer ??? 
Had an awesome time in < PROPFIRST > !!! Met up with my childhood friend , < PROPFEMALE > Skinner who I haven't seen in forever . Spent time shopping in Grapevine , < PROPMALE > , Addison and Farmers Branch . Then headed to Deep Ellum for dinner , The Cedars to see Gilley's and Absinthe , then back to Grapevine ... Whew !! I hope y'all enjoyed it ! Sorry , we didn't make it the the Stockyards . So much to see and so little time . 
I am so proud of the Badger Boys !! They played their hearts out last night . It wasn't their faults the refs spent the night in confusion ..... The refs would throw the yellow rags on the field then couldn't figure out what the penalty was for or who it was on ... They'd move the ball 10 yards one way , then 10 yards the other way , then scratch their heads and move it 5 yards back the other way .... Sheesh !! 
Cabela's , Spirit Halloween and Haunted Houses ..... Here We Come !!!!!! 
TOUGHGIRLS come from New York . SWEETGIRLS come from Louisiana . PRISSY GIRLS come from California . WE TEXAS GIRLS HAVE FIRE & ICE IN OUR BLOOD !

The cops said the trailer is sure to be in the Oak < PROPMALE > area . So , if you see a trailer with a brand new winch mounted on the front and loading ramps :) 
In Athens at TVCC Homecoming game and the Cardettes 50th Anniversary halftime performance . 2nd Qtr and Cards are ahead .

Awesome spot at the parade . Cardettes looked great . Traffic gridlock . Picked < PROPMALE > up in South < PROPMALE > . Long Drive Home . Turkey wasn't quite done . Dinner's over . Too much food . Good Company . Happy Thanksgiving Everyone !!!!!

Be very careful when you make a woman cry , because God counts her tears . The woman came out of a mans rib , not from his feet to be walked on , not from his head to be superior , but from his side to be equal , under the arm to be protected , and next to the heart to be loved .

SNOW DAY !! WOOHOO !!! I was almost to work and they shut Post down .. 
Parents think about their children day and night , even when they are grown . Parents love their children in a way that they will never understand . Parents will be there for their children when no one else will . Parents would take a bullet , stand in front of a train , and ask God to take them instead of their child . If you have a child or children that you love as much as I love mine repost this 
I figured out why I'm fat ! \
