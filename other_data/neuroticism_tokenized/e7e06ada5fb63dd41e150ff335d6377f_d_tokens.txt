How much you wanna bet Mr. Forgioni tells my parents how much of a problem I have concentrating ? 
People with gray eyes tend to be very gentle yet full of energy . They have a very busy life . They are a good judge of character . They are the most dark and mysterious . They tend to be very clean people . They are very rare and beautiful . They love the rain and tend to have a unique personality . People love to be around them for their calmness and confide in them more than anyone else . They love water and nature .
