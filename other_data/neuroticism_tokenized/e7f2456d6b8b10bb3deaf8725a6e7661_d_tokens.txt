When a child is a victim of abuse by a member of their family , their world has changed forever . They may have loved their abuser and the abuser has turned the relationship into something sadistic and cruel . The victim of abuse is likely to feel very confused . Feelings that result from abuse should not be buried away . As painful as it is , victims must talk about their experience and share their pain with others .

Sherlock Holmes : You've never complained about my methods before . \ 
Dr. < PROPFIRST > Watson : I'm not complaining . \ 
Sherlock Holmes : You're not ? What do you call this ? \ 
Dr. < PROPFIRST > Watson : I never complain ! How am I complaining ? When do I ever complain about you practicing the violin at three in the morning , or your mess , your general lack of hygiene , or the fact that you steal my clothes ? 
Inspector Lestrade : In another life , Mr. Holmes , you would have made a excellent criminal . \ 
Sherlock Holmes : Yes , and you an excellent policeman . 
< PROPFEMALE > Adler : Why are you always so suspicious ? \ 
Sherlock Holmes : Should I answer chronologically or alphabetically ? 
Sir Thomas : Mr. Holmes , apologies for summoning you like this . I'm sure it's quite a mystery as to where you are , and who I am ... \ 
Sherlock Holmes : As to where I am , I was , admittedly , lost for a moment , between Charing Cross and Holborn , but I was saved by the bread shop on Saffron Hill . The only baker to use a certain French glaze on their loaves - a < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > . 
[ Lestrade brings Holmes , handcuffed , before the Home Secretary , Lord Coward ] \

[ Lestrade lifts his lapel , showing a membership pin from the < PROPFEMALE > of the Four Orders ] \ 
Inspector Lestrade : ... and the Order , sir . 
Sherlock Holmes : There's only at one case that intrigues me at present . The curious case of Mrs. Hudson , the absentee landlady . I've been studying her comings and goings , they appear most ... sinister . \ 
Mrs. Hudson : Tea , Mr. Holmes ? \ 
Sherlock Holmes : Is it poisoned , Nanny ? \ 
Mrs. Hudson : There's enough of that in you already . 
< PROPFEMALE > Adler : I've never woke up in handcuffs before . \ 
Sherlock Holmes : I have . Naked . 
Dr. < PROPFIRST > Watson : You've been in this room for two weeks , I insist you have to get out . \ 
Sherlock Holmes : There is absolutely nothing of interest to me , out there , on earth , at all . \ 
Dr. < PROPFIRST > Watson : So you're free this evening ? \ 
Sherlock Holmes : Absolutely . \ 
Dr. < PROPFIRST > Watson : Dinner ? \ 
Sherlock Holmes : Wonderful . \ 
Dr. < PROPFIRST > Watson : The Royale ?

Dr. < PROPFIRST > Watson : [ irritated ] What have you done to Gladstone now ? \ 
Sherlock Holmes : I was simply testing a new anesthetic . He doesn't mind .

Dr. < PROPFIRST > Watson : Permission to enter the armory ? \ 
Sherlock Holmes : Granted . \

Sherlock Holmes : Watson , I am in the process of inventing a device which muffles the sound of a gunshot . \ 
[ He yells in pain as Watson opens the curtains , letting sunlight into the room ] \ 
Dr. < PROPFIRST > Watson : It's not working . 
Dr. < PROPFIRST > Watson : No , not you , < PROPFIRST > and I . You are not ... \ 
Sherlock Holmes : What ? Invited ? Why would I be not invited to my own brother's country home , Watson ? Now you are not making any sense ! \ 
Dr. < PROPFIRST > Watson : You are not human ! 
Dr. < PROPFIRST > Watson : [ Holmes points his violin bow at Watson ] Get that out of my face . \ 
Sherlock Holmes : It's not in your face , it's in my hand . \ 
Dr. < PROPFIRST > Watson : Get what's in your hand out of my face . 
Sherlock Holmes : [ to Lord Blackwood ] I wonder if they'd let Watson and me dissect your brain . After you < PROPFEMALE > , of course . I'd wager there would be some deformity that would be scientifically significant . In that way , at least , you could serve some kind of useful purpose . 
[ a chambermaid enters < PROPFEMALE > Adler's room and screams when she sees Holmes , handcuffed naked to the bed with a pillow covering his groin ] \ 
Sherlock Holmes : Madam , I need you to remain calm . And trust me , I'm a professional . Beneath this pillow , lies the key to my release . \ 
[ the Maid screams again and runs out ; cut to later in a carriage ]

If you are born once you die twice , if you are born twice you die once 
Always be free . Let no one bind you . Let no one hold you down . Let no one corrupt you . Let no one decieve you . Let no one control you . Let no one manipulate you . Let no human rule you . We are all equals . Be ever vigilant . Be ever hard-working . Never listen to the naysayers , you will prove them wrong with time . And finally , you must ROCK , and ROCK ONWARD !

Love has no < PROPFEMALE > but to fulfill itself . To melt and be like a running < PROPFEMALE > that sings its < PROPFEMALE > to the night . To wake at < PROPFEMALE > with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving . ~ Kahlil Gibran
