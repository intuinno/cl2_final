Some of the greater things in life are unseen , thats why you close your eyes when you kiss , cry , or dream <3 
My favorite quote of all time ---> \What are the three words guaranteed to humiliate men everywhere ? \ 
~ N o-o ne can go back and start a new beginning , but anyone can start today and make a new ending ~ (: 
~ The difference in life&school ? In school you are taught a lesson then given a test . In life , you're given a test that teaches you a lesson . ~ 
~ Anyone can give up , it's the \ 
easiest thing in the world to do . But to hold it together when everyone \ 
else would understand if you fell apart , that's true strength . ~ 
Awww Mr. Warenkee is gonna get fired ): \ 
HE A FLIPPIN AWESOME < PROPMALE > TEACHER WHY , WHY ADULTS HATIN ON AWESOME PEOPLE NOWADAYS !! ) < 
If death meant just leaving \ 
the stage long enough to change costume and come back as a new \

If you got problem with someone , why not fix it instead if leaving it that way ? If you don't fix drama , that's just because you want it there . If you spend all your life trying to fix one problem , then your pretty much not living your life (:
