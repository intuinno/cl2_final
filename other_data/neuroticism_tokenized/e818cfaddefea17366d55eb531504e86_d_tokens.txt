hamster and your mother smells of elderberries ! now go away before i \ 
insult you a second time ! 
booster concert tomorrow , be stuck at school from 8am to about 11pm 
jumping into the unknown just because life is too short to not explore :/ 
Walked 6 < PROPMALE > to see < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPMALE > and a couple other people xD . It was definately worth it 
Sir Galahad : Look , let me go back in there and face the \ 
peril . \ 
\ 
Sir Lancelot : No , it's too perilous . \ 
Sir Galahad : Look , it's my duty as a knight to sample as \ 
much peril as I can . \ 
Sir Lancelot : No , we've got to find the Holy Grail . Come on . \ 
Sir Galahad : Oh , let me have just a little bit of peril ? \ 
Sir Lancelot : No . It's unhealthy . \ 
Sir Galahad : I bet you're gay . \ 
Sir Lancelot : Am not .

playing a show w/This Body Before Us july 6th in Manastee MI !!! 
this week is not going to be fun 
out of school friday , looks like this is going to be one hell of a summer xD 
band practice with This Body Before Us today , than This is North tomorrow xD 
going to have an amazing day with < PROPFEMALE > and get to see < PROPFEMALE > and some old friends 
band practice was good , and hanging out with < PROPFEMALE > was amazing as always <3 
Love isn't finding someone you can live with , it's finding someone you can't live without . ~ < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Fraser-Shadbolt 
tonight is not going to be fun . 
life is about choices and consiquences . the people who make the choice to create drama and don't take responsibility for their own actions are just pathetic 
bored outta my freak'n mind 
anyone wanna < PROPFEMALE > out ? lol 
went to sleep at 10pm last night , woke up at about 3-4am ish .... already wondering what im going to do today . facebook is only getting more and more boring . 
counting down the hours waiting for another pointless fight to end 
anything that can go wrong , will go wrong .. Murphy's law 
Running out of ways to run \ 
I can't see , I can't be \ 
Over and over and under my skin \ 
All this attention is doing me in 
i cant take this level of depression anymore .... 
life moves on .. 
Time to start over , time to forgive , but not to forget . Time to try again , and this time it will be different . for better or for worse 
emotions are an uncontrollable rolacoster ride . one day you can concidering suicide than the next you can be exploading with happiness for no apparent reason . 
the long intellectual conversations are the best . even better when they challenge the way you think 
Why are we here ? \ 
A question that no one will ever answer so think for\ 
your fucking self\ 
Don't believe something because someone told you \ 
to and don't be scared into living someone else's way . Don't just say \ 
what you're suppose to say speak for yourself and never give that Right \ 
away . I'm so sick of hearing people say how I should live my life and \ 
if I don't follow their rules I will suffer the consequence . 
Never be afraid to open up your mind and look at the world through \ 
someone else's eyes . \ 
This is something you should never forget . If \ 
so then it's not really your life anymore . Don't just say the what \ 
you're suppose to say speak for yourself and never give that Right away . Speak\ 
for yourself 
The word of a liar means nothing 
rather be hated for doing something right than be hated for doing nothing . 
Everything changes , everything evolves , and everything ends . The only way to stay ontop is to be constantly changing , evolving and creating something new . If you don't you'll get left behind . 
friends come and go , but true friends will always stand by your side . 
THIS BODY BEFORE US IS PERFORMING IN CHARLIVOUX MI @ THE FLIGHT DECK BAR @ 11:30 18+ show ! have to show up with an id .

This Body Before US is playing this up coming wensday at the flight deck bar in charlivoux MI at 11pm !!!!!!!!!!! 
is finally walking down the path that ive worked so hard to find . 
its so entertaining to be completely random in a conversation , ( your friend obviously not knowing or understanding what you said asks you about it ) to either A- pretend to not know what they're talking about or B- pretend to forget about it 
Boredom -- [Poke ] me if you've ever had a crush on me , [ Like ] this \ 
status if you think I'm a good friend , [ Message ] me if you have ever\ 
wanted to date me and don't [ Comment ] . Now let's see who is brave \ 
enough to copy and paste this as their status . -- Do it , you know you \ 
want to . 
fighting is the most pointless thing in exsistance 
anyone know where to get an esp/ltd all white mh 400-1000 or ec 400-1000 used ?

99%\

askyscraper about to jump . If you are the 1% sitting there with popcorn \ 
and 3D glasses , screaming \DO A BACKFLIP ! \ " 
watching movies , and bored . practice tomorrow 
Before you can grow up you must fall in love 3 times . Once you must fall in love with your best friend , ruining your friendship forever . This will teach you who your true friends are , and the fine line between friendship and more . Once you must fall in love with someone you believe to be perfect . 
I should get paid for giving back massages . Damn freebies 
Yesterday at around 10pm 4 drunk women wanted to take pictures with me , one looked 23-24ish she was from italy the rest were in their 30s and were local . It was quite awkward at first , but is was both funny and fun . xD They also called me cute , wonder if they knew i was 16 ....

Dear Twilight fans , \

Please realize that because vampires are dead and have \ 
no blood pumping through them , they can never get an erection . Enjoy \ 
fantasizing about that . \

Sincerely , Logic . 
Fear ? What is there to fear in love ? Love is the very\ 
reason we live . To fear love is to lose all sense of living , \ 
and if we cannot love , then why have we been put here ? Fearing\ 
love is like being afraid of breathing . It's not something\ 
to be scared of . It's so natural that no one can resist .... Unknown . 
Dear Digestive Tract , \ 
Owned . \

The show was fucking amazing !!!!!!! thank you all for coming out . and thanks to everyone who kept fucking moving !!!!!!!! Gonna miss < PROPFIRST > . 
send me a number to my inbox and ill post your number and what i think about you XD bbl 
My ankle is now cracked or fractured thanks to being next to < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > in a fucking mosh pit . xD 
well , now im on krutches and vicodine with a possible hairline fracture and an incredibly bad sprain . wow i feel like a cripple 
#42 When i first met you i thought you were honestly just another girl in tc trying to add a twist to the trend . Well , the more i got to know you the more you proved me wrong . You are definitly someone i wish to keep around . thanks for inspiring me to be myself , and to be proud of who i am . 
#997 you're for sure the coolist cousin in law . It's fun to have intelligant conversations with you because you have a unique yet educated perspective . Just wish you lived closer so we could < PROPFEMALE > out more :P 
#989 the fact that you managed to date one of the most complex and the most sadistic girls i know is suprising , and the fact that your still alive ! lol . you know i have to pick on you for that . I miss hanging out with you though . so fuck you and your gf for moving to cadillac 
#666 you are not metal enough for this number . you're a pretty funny dude , and you definitely know the music scene pretty well . You're also quite fun to < PROPFEMALE > around with at shows lol . You are a bit too fruity though which leads me to 2 questions ... Have your balls ever dropped and when will you be coming out of the closet ? lmfao just fucking with man . keep it metal 
#2012 You're a pretty cool dude , you have a lot of potential to some pretty wicked things . I'm sure your time will come to take over a spot light xD just keep practicing and do what you want to do , and follow your dreams no matter what anyone says . who ever hates what you're trying to acomplish is truly a waste of your time and should be ignored . You just need to make your voice heard bro 
#64 Even though i have only known you for a week . I've realised that you're a very caring and interesting person . I enjoy the fact that we both share the same love for music . Maybe one day we can express that love together . 
No school tomorrow . yay . xD 
Thanks to everyone for the birthday comments really made me smile ! xD 
Does TC even have school tomorrow ? 
Enjoys deep conversations with close friends way too much
