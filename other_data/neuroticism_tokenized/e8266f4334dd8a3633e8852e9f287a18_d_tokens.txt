Okay , so because of the debts the football team has piled up over the last few years , Dr. Gibson is temporarily pulling the plug on any unneccesary funding . That includes renovating the black box . Some track and field equipment will also be sold in order to bring up money for the football debt . This also affects a few other teams , but I don't exactly remember which one . I think hockey was one of the listed teams
