I think that the Riverside County Sherriffs Department is corrupt and should be investigated . Also , the D . A's office and some of the criminal court judges . It will be a great day when Riverside purges all of the scum out of its county offices . P . S- Just because somebody isn't wealthy , doesn't mean that their local police have the right to ruin their lives .

Last night I got to go to the wedding of one of my favorite comrad's wedding . It was beautiful and I almost cried watching < PROPFIRST > dance with her father . I just wish that I could have seen her walk down the isle . 
My grandpa just went crazy on my cousin for not telling him that she let my friends out ( even though she shut off the lights and locked the door ) . Then yelled at me for my friends being here past 1am ( even though they were only here until 1:15 and my grandpa said they could stay until our movie was over ) . 
He told me that my curfew was an hour earlier and was yelling and throwing a tantrum . My grandma ( who is sick from stress ) came out of her room because of the commotion and started yelling at my grandpa . She had just told him earlier to leave my cousin and I alone and he only listened for a couple of hours before this rampage . 
My grandpa wouldn't calm down and my grandma unexpectedly slapped him in the face . My grandpa got even more crazy and grabbed my grandma by the arms and started to shake her , which caused my cousin and I to get angry and yell at him to stop . My cousin got up and helped my grandma to the room .. 
My grandpa yelled down the hallway about how he does everything for my grandma and he's going to leave by morning . Now I can't sleep and want to beat the crap out of my grandpa for being soooo ridiculous , childish and over dramatic . I had to get this off of my chest .... sorry for rambling . 
It doesn't matter what you look like ! I mean if you have a hunchback , just throw a little glitter on it , < PROPFEMALE > , and go dancing

People that tell you not to go to the place you want . Then convince the person you're with not to go and go somewhere else . Then goes with that person to the place that you wanted to and doesn't show back up to your house when he says he will . While he has the sack you paid for ..... Are ASSHOLES !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
