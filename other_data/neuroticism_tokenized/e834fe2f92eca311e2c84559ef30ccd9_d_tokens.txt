I haven't been on in a while . Trying to short sale the house .. < PROPMALE > has the approval to transfer to Riverview , FL .. Drowned my cell phone in the pool jumping after < PROPFEMALE > last week .. Going to empty most of the house 4th of July weekend .. Moving to Riverv 

Still no updated pics .. I had some on the phone .. i am hoping it can be salvaged from the card on the phone . I might have to steal some pics from my families facebook/my space pages 
Yup .. Short selling the house .. been busy packing and putting our stuff in the new garage in Riverview , FL . 
getting bored with the facebook games 
another day of packing and moving . You don't realize how much stuff you accumulate in 4 years until you have to move it .

I am about 11 weeks along in the pregnancy . I won't know if it is a boy or girl for another 10ish weeks . What do you think of these names : < PROPFEMALE > for girl and < PROPMALE > for boy ? 
I am so tired of this 90 degree and high humidity weather . I thought it was October . Where is the cool weather ? I could totally roll around in some snow right now .

< PROPFEMALE > has strep throat . Hopefully it isn't what i have . The doc says if my throat starts hurting i must go get checked out . 
It's Michigan weather today in Tampa .. dreary , grey , raining , drizzle , cold 57 degrees 
My bad luck continues .. my laptop has Disk Read Error and will not boot up to windows . Nice . super upset . Then my darn work laptop won't connect to the internet .. So all i have left is my husband's laptop , which has lines down the screen . 
Hopefully I feel better tomorrow . If i feel as miserable as this morning , I will be on my way to the doctor .

< PROPFIRST > you calendars .. < PROPFEMALE > will be born Tuesday , March 16th at 7am . We are excited to have her . 
< PROPFEMALE > is sick with high fever and nasty cough .. The doc says the fever can last for a week . what a bummer . Now < PROPMALE > is getting sick .. 
Today was supposed to be my day off , < PROPFEMALE > was supposed to go to school , and < PROPMALE > was supposed to go to work . But they are all sick and staying home . I wish they would get better . 
Now is my turn .. my chest hurts so bad and i cant stop coughing . I have a baby doctor appt today . < PROPMALE > has broncitis and sinus infection . < PROPFEMALE > is still sick . :-( 
< PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > have tested negative for flu . But prego me .. has tested positive today . The doc thinks it is swine flu . Totally sucks . I am hurting so bad . 
Good News .. even though i feel worse in the chest . I have bronchitis and tested negative for the flu yesterday . The doc says I either beat the flu or it was a false positive initially when I got the test done . The baby is doing good , kicking and moving around alot inside me . The doc says bronchitis doesn't harm the baby . But the doc wants me to rest for another 4-5 days . I forgot to ask for a note for work . 
Tired .. I need a laundry < PROPFEMALE > , who would sweep in wave a wand .. and magic .. laundry cleaned , folded , and put away . 
I think I am having some < PROPMALE > braxton hicks contractions .. started friday . The baby feels like she is pushing down . I never did experience labor with < PROPFEMALE > . 
< PROPMALE > and I agree on the baby's new name .. but we are not agreeing to the spelling . Should it be < PROPFEMALE > or < PROPFEMALE > ? 
I really hate the new pampers commercial - Pampers Potty Dance . I hate the guy , I hate his music , and I hated him when he was on the disney channel . 
Almost had the baby last thursday . Went into labor at work . Had to go to the hospital and get the contractions stopped and rehydrated . She would have been 6 week early . We are doing fine . 
I am so grateful for my friends and close coworkers . They threw me a surprise baby shower and took me out to lunch at Cheese Cake Factory yesterday . They also got me a large gift certificate to Baby's R US . I was able to buy the stroller I have been dreaming to have !! They totally ROCK !!! 
I can't wait to have < PROPFEMALE > . Few more weeks to go . I feel like I am going to bust and < PROPFEMALE > keeps digging into me to get out . I am so excited !! 
OMG Canada just won Gold hockey olympics .. boooo 
I want all the house drama to go away . Met with an attorney today on foreclosure summons . And stopped by the house to check on it . Someone broke into our house and stole all the inside doors and half the carpeting . Also broke a window to get in . 
< PROPFEMALE > is turning 4 on March 14th . I am thinking of taking her to a farm for pony rides , petting zoo , barnyard playground . 
on bed rest till scheduled c-section 3/16 . i tried to last for work . but my contractions r being triggered by sitting and walking . too much pressure on the uterus . 
< PROPFEMALE > wants to go to Chuckie Cheese today . Unforntunetly I cant take her , because i wont be able to play the games with her or dig her out of the tunnels . 
bored .. i miss shopping and being able to walk around every where . Just walked the dog to the mail box and pulled a stomach muscle .. bed rest sucks . < PROPFEMALE > keeps trying to dig out . 
Less than a week to go . Can't wait for < PROPFEMALE > to be born . I keep crying to all the baby shows .. like bringing home the baby . I have to stay away from health channel and discovery channel during the day . 
< PROPMALE>'s birthday tomorrow .. < PROPFEMALE>'s birthday Sunday .. < PROPFEMALE > to be born Tuesday .. no big parties this year . since i am hugely pregnant and cant move around much .. But taking < PROPFEMALE > to petting zoo for her first pony ride Sunday . 
just finished wrapping < PROPFEMALE>'s birthday gifts . she is getting her first Caboodle !! it is a little one .. she loves her lip glosses and sparkley makeup . 
Today is < PROPFEMALE>'s 4th Birthday . Grandpa is here !! We are surprising her with Pony ride and petting zoo today . 
Finaly got a < PROPMALE > to log on , since Monday . check out my tagged photos . They are of < PROPFEMALE > !! My sister < PROPFIRST > is awesome to put these up to share for me . 
my days consist of breastfeeding , changing poopy diapers , < PROPFEMALE > and zoo world . 
Please understand that millions of Michiganders suffer from a rare blood disease that causes them to bleed the color GREEN . We are not looking for a cure , only a National Title . ....... Repost if you are also afflicted .... GO SPARTANS !!!! 
Have not been online for a week . Been busy catching up on sleep and recovering from a darn breast infection . < PROPFEMALE > is still eating every two/three hours and < PROPFEMALE > is full of energy . Cant keep up with them !! 
looking for zoomate !! send me a friend invite reference ZOO please 
i love my treasure < PROPMALE > . it finds the treasure on each of your zoomates when you click on them . you dont have to find it 
BORED .. I actually miss work . I love the time with my kids , but i can't get out of the house with them . feeding < PROPFEMALE > every 2-3 hours takes up so much time . I am not sure what i am going to do to get everyone ready in the morning when I have to return back to work . 
Hi ZOO WORLD Friends .. I need 1 of each of these animals . Any would be greatly appreciated . I need it for leveling up - black panther , great horned owl , swift , american big horn , dik dik , binturoug , african wild dog , red panda , brushtail possum , harbor porpoise , hedgehog , leafy sea dragon , gharial , amami rabbit . 
i have another breast infection . my whole body hurts so bad . 
Hi Zoomates .. I need 1 of each Black Panther , Dik Dik , and Binturoug to level up 
Going to make it a good day today . the antibiotics are working and i have a lot of housework to catch up on and grocery shopping . I will feel better knowing i actually accomplished something around here . 
We can't continue to dwell on the past . Since we identified the our problems , it is time to change , grow , and move on . Since the devil is no longer in our lives . Remember we need to stick together even though we have our differences in dealing . 
Part of my husband's job is to close the game room and tv room at the apartment complex , because residents have vandalized the rooms . So last night , a beligerent resident cussed out and called my husband every name in the book and called him a Spic and other hispanic racial remarks . All he was trying to do was close up the rooms . The other residents left with no problems .. 
just the 1 lady with the nasty mouth on her and she kept turning everything back on . She was going on and on with the remarks for 20 minutes . This is very uncalled for . < PROPMALE > and I have been married for 5 years and nobody has ever called him a Spic in all the time . I dont want the resident living here any more . I see her as a threat . What would she do and say to my children and other hispanic residents . 
It looks like tropical storm weather outside 
i wish i could be a stay at home mom .. yes i said it . i want to stay at home with my girls . 
This is a warning to my friends and family in Michigan . < PROPFEMALE > Curry is moving back to Michigan . I would call her my mother , but she disowned me and my family . Growing up she wished she never had me . Now she is living her wish . 
Saw the doctor today for post partum 6 week normal appointment . I have lost 34 lbs since I had < PROPFEMALE > . woop woop !! 
Time will heal all wounds and pain is only temporary . I am blessed to have my two beautiful girls , but it is painful to see all the mother's day stuff on tv and everywhere , because my mother disowned us . I still can't grasp how a mother will want to disown her children and grandchildren . I could not and will never do that to my family . I want to send < PROPFEMALE > a \You SUCK\ " mother's day card . " 
We have been trying to sell our house since June last year . We received an offer about a month ago . And the bank just approved the short sale !!!! We should be closing on the house soon . This is going to be the biggest relief off of our shoulders . 
True friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question their friendship . And pick up like they just spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been ........ REPOST if you are lucky enough to have at least one . 
to my zoo mates . does anyone still need pacifiers ? 
Back in December . My laptop couldn't find its hard drive and stopped working . I finally decided to work on it and get it back up and running today . I turned on the computer for the first time since december and IT IS WORKING !!! YAY !!! 
< PROPFEMALE > has a bad ear infection . Tomorrow I am back to work from maternity leave 8 weeks . Luckily I have a wonderful new nanny to stay with the girls . Or else I would have to take time away from work to care for < PROPFEMALE > . Because she wouldnt be allowed to return to day care . 
1st day back to work today . missed my girls . Had over 1000 unread emails !!! It is a big relief to have a great babysitter . 
< PROPFEMALE > is very sick again . Her ear is infected and possibly the mastoid bone too . :-( If this new round of antibiotics don't work by friday . She will have to go to the hospital for intravenous antibiotics . This already happened to her when she was 1 1/2 years old . 
Thank goodness < PROPFEMALE > is doing much better . We saw the doctor again on Friday . We are waiting for test results on Monday . It was a very long night . 
do you ever have those moments you want to change your career ? 
< PROPFEMALE > is 2 months old today !!!! 
tired of facebook games .. going to play game cube with my 4 year old .. 
< PROPFEMALE > had her 2 month well baby checkup today . She is 24 inches long and 13lbs 14oz . She is at the 98% for baby girls her age . She is a healthy happy baby !!!! 
Yay !! Back to school for me Monday .. nothing like cutting it close .. I almost missed this semester because I was waiting on a transcript from HCC . It took over 4 weeks !! But < PROPFEMALE > at University of Tampa is awesome .. She came back from vacation to get me into a class !! 
I have 9 more classes to take to finally finish my degree . The difficult part is some of the classes are only offered during the day 1-4pm . I am happy my super awesome Director at work approved my unique work schedule to fit in the day class !! 
First day of my weird work/school schedule . I think it worked out well . I got in early 7am and was there for my early employees , then was their late for my late employees . and went to class in the middle . The day flew by . 
U make me hard when I'm all soft inside\ 
I see the truth when I'm all stupid-eyed \ 
The arrow goes straight throught my heart [ Without you everything just falls apart ] \ 
My blood just wants to say hello to you \ 
My soul is so afraid to realize \ 
How every little bit is left of me \ 
And I want you\ 
You are the perftect drug 
I am so busy that i don't have time to be depressed !! 
so mad right now .. Finished my HW at midnight . Hit save .. and my computer crashed again !! 3 hours of homework gone . 
Some people question what I do and why I do some things ; but they dont realize I do things for a reason and I dont show all my cards ; and I will win in the end . I am a very nice person , but never take advantage of me because I will tighten the reins . < PROPFEMALE > is a virtue and must always be flexible to change to survive . 
Had an awesome weekend with my family and friends .. now back to the grind of sick kids , work , school , and messy house !! 
WANTED : Sleep . Priceless 
Just tried Redbox for the first time over weekend . Love it !! I did not like the new movie < PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland . I loved Sherlock Holmes . 
Was sick this morning . tried to get up and was dizzy , couldnt balance or stand up .. doing alot better now . i am not sure what caused that spell . 
I just learned a new name \RUG\ " - half thug half redneck ... hahahaha " 
To my family and friends .. i have been really bad lately with cards , photos , communication .. I have to finish a project by wednesday . I will be working on cards and everything else soon . The past month has been a whirlwind . I have a very short break of a few days before everything spins out of control again . < PROPFEMALE>'s ear surgery is the 7th . 
< PROPFEMALE > is growing up so fast .. rolling front to back and back to front .. rolling to get to things .. and eating rice cereal now .. She will be 4 months old in a couple of weeks . 
We layed a sheet on the ground in the living room for < PROPFEMALE > . She rolls around all over . She is the sweetest baby ever . She loves < PROPFEMALE > and always looking for her . 
UPDATES : Sick with migraine and soar throat .. i really do not need this right now . I hope stinky kid ( nasty cheap cologne ) doesnt sit by me at school today . Finally my open position on my team is posted today ( took HR over 2 weeks ) . Moved my desk at work yesterday . Love my new seat- more priviate . < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > are happy and healthy . I love my hubby < PROPMALE > . 
I have run out of data usage at home .. so i wont be on facebook again until 19th or if i can escape , like now , and use the computer lab at school . If you need me , dont use facebook to communicate with me , call or send txt message to my cell . 
Happy the weekend is here !! Last week of class next week !! Then a couple week break !!. 
Instead of making energy drinks . They need to come up with \SLEEPY\ " drinks . For adults and children !! " 
I am tired of FB games . Going to hide it all for a while . 
Having good times with < PROPFEMALE > .. Wish I was on VACA right now . Couple more weeks to go !! Please give me the < PROPFEMALE > and energy to make it through the next couple of weeks . 
must study .. cant stay off of facebook and bugging peeps .. final exam tomorrow 
< PROPFEMALE > is asleep .. I need to duck tape < PROPFEMALE > to bed . 
I really wish it was Friday night .. I want to stay up a little longer and sleep in tomorrow .. darn not going to happen .. 
Shopping weekend . Need to buy < PROPFEMALE > new shoes . She is already size 13 !!! But some school supplies too . Maybe some craft stuff too . 
I need a money tree with $50 and $100 leaves . 
< PROPFEMALE > should go to bed .. But mommy and her are having too much fun whacking each other with pool noodles 
Went shoe shopping with the fam .. and it was horrible .. so many people .. and so hot .. i will never shop again during this tax break weekend . It is not worth it . i had to take a nap when we got home . my nerves were shot . 
Lease will be up soon Sept 30th . Looking to rent a house and get out of the apt . Tired of < PROPMALE > being on call 24/7 . He did 2 calls today and he was supposed to be off this weekend . Our weekends are always interrupted for this place . The amount we are paying for a 3/2 apt with little discount , I found house rentals 4/2 , 5/2 with more sq ft and garage . 
I hope everyone has a great night .. sleep tight .. don't let the bed bugs bite . 
I am going to dream about being in a house again and all the great bbq's and house parties we used to have with family and friends . 
margaritas !!! yum 
< PROPFEMALE>'s first day of Pre-K today . < PROPFEMALE > had a great time . But I signed her up for 9-12 class . When I picked her up , they told me she is in the 9:30 - 12:30 class . I signed up months ago and verified during orientation for 9-12 , but some how her class is 9:30 - 12:30 . They said it will be fine to pick her up before 12:30 every day . 
Been on Vaca .. but didnt do anything .. too much rain .. and the girls waking me up every other hour in the night and they are have been sick with a bad cold . 
I have started making my own baby food this past weekend - feels good knowing < PROPFEMALE > is getting fresh food - I made a whole bunch of carrots , squash , mango , pear , sweet potato and put them in portions using ice cube trays and ready to use . 
I received a letter from University of Tampa today . As a result of my outstanding academic achievement , been invited to participate in Univ of Tampa Chapter of The National Society of Leadership and Success . Very excited about it . 
I felt really old today in first day of fall class . so many young college students . i thought to myself 1 . i bet i acted like that then and how carefree , no stress , no responsibilties . Of course . didnt realize it then 2 . i wanted to hit the girl with her damn cell phone vibrating with her texts messages every other minute for 3 hours . 3 . i need to find strength to get through this semester . 
Moving to a house the 25th !! Had awesome time bbq and pool yesterday with friends and our kids .. back to chores , hw , and laundry ;-( 
< PROPFEMALE > can now move from laying position to a sitting position .. and she crawls straight ahead instead of a rolling around . She is growing up so fast . 
If your dad is or was your hero , your best friend , or just the best dad ever , whether you are blessed to have him still with you , or if he is an angel in heaven , copy and paste this into your status and let everyone know you are proud of your dad and that you love him dearly . I love you , daddy .? 
We just moved into a bigger house . It is amazing and feels great . < PROPFEMALE > is crawling all over the place . The kitchen and living room is huge . We have so much stuff . I finally have a place for all of my coke bottles . 
Please < PROPMALE > me < PROPFEMALE > to get through the day tomorrow . 
I am looking soooo Forward to tonight .. I can't wait for the fun . I am going to go out and buy an outfit that fits !!! 
Trying to stay awake to do homework .. but my brain is shutting down and eyes are closing while sitting in the chair . Good Night . tomorrow is another day !! 
It is not a good idea to work really hard at work the day of an exam .. I am wiped out and my brain is shutting down .. caffine is not working . I have a darn paper to write tonight .. Is there a drink that gets rid of fuzziness in the head ? 
I figured out I have a lack of energy , because i am sick . Bummer . i hope i can make it to work tomorrow . 
frustration to the maximus . 
I didnt think by the time I turn thirty . I would have 2 beautiful daughters , a wonderful husband , and my father is finally happy . 
I still dont understand why people in florida where socks with sandels ... 
warn out from trick or treating with < PROPFEMALE > . Lots of fun and lots of < PROPFEMALE > !! I am trying something new this year .. I have seperated the < PROPFEMALE > into sandwich baggies .. so when < PROPFEMALE > is good . it is already presorted and she gets a goodie bag . like when she helps dad when i am at school . 
My stomach is all messed up . I was hoping it was nothing earlier today and now it is something . Everytime i get headway at work or school . I or someone in the house gets sick . bummer 
waiting to checkout at walmart . i cant believe people have young kids here . 
When you lose your cell phone at least you can call it and find it .. but when you lose your financial calculator you need for class .. i have no idea how to find it . i thought it was in my bag .. wrong .. maybe < PROPFEMALE > took it .. but i need it very bad right now in class .. I cant calculate my present values and payments for a lease !!!! 
Has anyone seen a financial calculator laying around ? If you find one randomly somewhere it is probably mine . 
On the road for an hour . Cant wait to see my family . Excited I have internet in the suv . Love verizon wireless !!!
