Today , my friends approached me and accused me of being anorexic cause i've dropped a lot of weight lately . I swore to them that i wasn't anorexic . They jokingly asked \Do you have cancer or something ? \ " All i could do was stare at my feet . That wasn't exa " 
Today , I was fired from my volunteer job . Why ? Because they said I was working so hard and doing such a good job that I was making the real staff look bad . FML

AHHHH i had the newspaper interview yesterday , and it was HORRIBLE . i was SOOO tongue tied . grrrrr 
Love is a sensation caused by a temptation to feel penetration . A guy sticks his location in a girl´s destination to increase the population for the next generation , did u get my explanation or do u want a demonstration ? XD 
Just saw the five pics banned by Google . I kind of want to throw up now . 
LONG nap ... :) 
blaaaahhhh geometry 
Last day of school ! Ahhhh ! 
Oh my goodness , it does NOT feel like summer ... but IT IS ! IT IS ! :D 
My mother is usually a very level-headed person , but when it comes to Mexican singing competitions , she acts like a complete teenager . 
Why is it when I tell myself to do something , my brain has a relapse of about two weeks ? 
So far the Last Song is pretty disappointing . They cut so much out of the story line , and the characters don't even resemble how they were in the book . The father is a lot more outspoken than he should be , < PROPFIRST > should be less attracted to Will in the beginning , and Will should be a lot less of a player . So far the best characters are Blaze , < PROPFIRST > , and < PROPMALE > . 
No hay rosas ni juguetes que paguen por mi amor . 
I just learned that everyone in Secret Life is over 20 years old except for Shailene Woodley , who plays < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFEMALE > Eisley , who plays < PROPFIRST > . And < PROPFIRST > , of course . :) 
Is anyone else excited about GLEE tonight ? :D
