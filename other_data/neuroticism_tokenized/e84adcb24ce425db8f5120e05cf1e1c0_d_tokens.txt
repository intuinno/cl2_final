\We are a way for the Cosmos to know itself . \ " \ 
Time is but the illusion of fleeting moments\ 
an attachment to the past , present , and future\ 
it seperates us from the eternal being of stillness\ 
and blinds us with a vast delusion ... 
laziest of Trees , the < PROPFEMALE > now :\ 
Her leaves , slumber slightly a bough\ 
but in the Wood , She stands a Queen , \ 
swaying softly , in the Summer sheen . \ 
\ 
bowing only to the Heaven's Sky , \ 
whose silver tear drops , Rain down a cry ;\ 
a Healing nectar from above , \ 
a flood of Water , a flood of Love . \ 
a score , and two , of Life I've now liv'd\ 
is but enough for me to Forgive . \ 
so about the < PROPMALE > I roam\ 
lazily humming the < PROPFEMALE>'s OM

Please excuse this blasphemy\ 
But I feel the trinity\ 
A phallic fallacy\ 
For without the mother\ 
Life cannot be\ 
So let us worship truthfully\ 
The Father and the Mother\ 
And the Greater Spirit \ 
Dual aspect of them both

Our ability to imagine anything is what makes us infinite and our ability to come together to create life is what makes us divine ! :) Love and Blessings to all . 
The realm of Spirit is beyond our finite experience of this physical place . We may destroy ourselves , here , in this world , but we will never destroy that which exists beyond us , and like the < PROPFEMALE > s , we will remain as bodies of light that shine forth eternal , for even as a < PROPFEMALE > collapses upon itself , it gives birth to a new < PROPFEMALE > , and ejecting living energy outward , it gives birth to new life . 
Once again , < PROPMALE > Aronofsky has proved himself a mad genius ... Black Swan was dark , twisted , disturbing , and a \perfect\ " rendition of a psychological trip . " 
\Nothing is so much to be feared as fear . Atheism may comparatively be popular with God himself . \ " - Thoreau\

Death is but a dream ( February 10 , 2011)\ 
Death takes us , each night , \ 
to dream of limitless possibility . \ 
But with every morning , as the sun\ 
does rise , we too are reborn . \ 
So why this pointless fear\ 
of that which is unknown ? \ 
Why this futile struggle\ 
to hold on , this refusal\ 
to let go , to move on ?

Today I stand with the teachers , nurses , and all public employees of Wisconsin who are fighting for their rights . If you do too , change this to your status for the rest of the day

So , for anyone who is not aware , Gov . Corbett , a republican , is trying to cut < PROPFEMALE>'s state funding for higher education by 50% . He also plans to cut the K-12 budget as well . \
