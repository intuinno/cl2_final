-Everybody stand up ! Today's the best day to get up . Everyone is a victim of this attraction , Yeah . Come on ! Everybody hands up ! It's the highly anticipated Hero's comeback ! Hold up your fingers and count down ... 3 .. 2 .. 1 .. Make some noise ! 

-You got to be careful with things nearest to you , You know the closer you get to something the tougher it is to see . And I'll never take it for granted , let go ... 
-Heh it makes sense now why she doesn't like me , go figure 
-No regrets , no distractions 
-There's no need for sadness anymore , because there's always a sliver lining ^_^ 
-Lost in a dark abyss looking for a way out , There must have been something I missed ... 
-I wish I have nothing to do in the morning so I could just stargaze all night 
-Damn this human flaw of curiosity 
-Just take a < PROPMALE > , it makes life worth living and exciting 
-A hero to some , an angel to a few , but a friend to all 
-Helpful words are like a train track switch , it's only an inch from a wreck or a smooth travel to prosperity 
-I'll be that hero you can turn to 
-I try to find the good in life , but good things are hard to come by 
-Right here on my wing you can rest your head 
-With theses eyes I can see the lies 
-I laugh at the idea I'm \most optimistic\ " because everywhere I turn I see and feel disappointment Hmm .. " 
-Are you ready ? Set . Go ! 
-Dream , Live , and make life an adventure 
-People are really interesting 
-HA ! Why let idiots ruin the night , glad I had a laugh with the other ones there 
Yarinokoshitera koto yarinaoshite mitai < PROPFEMALE > 
-It's ok not to know where we'll be later on . Hell , I'll tell you when I get there too . 
-Life isn't complicated , it's really on how we view that complicates things 
-I can bring a thought to your mind , a tear to your eye or a smile to your face , the catch is I can't be seen because I'm just a memory 
-I always think I'm insignificant but everyone see that I'll be the one to make a difference 
-Everyday seems to be a lie , I don't know why . I just want to fly into that big blue sky 
-Battle every minute , Fight every second 
is finally taking one day at a time 
feels like falling 
-Looks like luck makes fools of us all 
-Things happen in a flash but feels like an eternity 
is doing strength training for freerunning 
-In order to have a life of happiness , one must take in each day at a time and < PROPFEMALE > the moments ; In order to have a life of purpose , one must focus on the future and plan for that destination ; Though I question myself each day ' Why can't I have both ? ' 
-Maybe that one mistake helped me understand that everything can't go according as planned and I have to look beyond myself to see the world around me . 
-Taking a < PROPMALE > can make this life an adventure or nothing meaningful at all 
-Even though action speak louder than words they both have the same effect 
-Just got to make the best of the situation 
finally finished a project that was suppose to be finished a month ago . 
-Life and Time go hand in hand , Let's make the most of both of them 
-There's always that subtle message into each phase 
-Experiment with the possibilities , nothing bad will happen if you try 
-I think I'm ready for the chapter in life with the similar but new system . 
-Honesty can be shared without being hurtful or rude ; How can we let others know who we are or who they are ; Unless the truth is spoken then no bad idea will be challenged or no good idea would be shared 
-Giving words of wisdom isn't my thing , It's just stuff I tell myself to make me feel good 
-The breezy night calms the mind 
-How insignificant we really are when we look up at the sky and just dream ... Knowing that the world just keeps on spinning 
-Constantly falling through air watching clouds and memories pass on by 
-The storm in my minded hasn't passed .. I'm just stuck in the eye of it 
-I can't believe what I'm thinking , But it feels like I'm giving up , giving up slowly , Starting to blend in so you won't notice me . 
-Maybe there isn't a reason to stick around anymore . 
-Doing things our own way may make us unique , but when doing it with a group in perfect < PROPFEMALE > is phenomenal 
-Run , Fly , Breathe , Flow in this movement of life 
-Learning the < PROPMALE > of Movement comes with alot of pain , good thing I've survived with a sprained ankle and cuts on my arms . 
-Just another part of life that just needs to get done 
-The movements are basic but once put together it becomes phenomenal to watch it flow 
-I finally feel I got all the time in the world to do anything . 
-Stand up and get ready to flow in the < PROPMALE > of movement and motion and see the world spin 
feels good getting all homework and notes for the day . Time to work out and eat 
-It seems everywhere I look someone a special talent . For example there is a 5 year old tennis prodigy in Florida . I'm puzzled on what mine is . 
-Who knew I would be taking a class where I just have to show up and run to get an A . Another great way to get freerunning training in . 
-Interesting how our perception can either open new possibilities around us or simply blind us from the world 
-Flowing in the < PROPMALE > of motion one leap at a time 
-The haunting past can still bring a sliver lining to the future 
-It's amazing that 5 minutes of solitude and bring my blazing temper to a calm sea , and that a friendly face can bring back alot of memories . Interesting day 
-Looking back again makes me wonder what I actually did in the past to make me what I am today 
- I'm not the answer for the questions that you still may have 
-There's no reason to give up now and be another face in the crowd ... 
-They say good things happen in the end , but if good things aren't happening at the moment then it's not the end 
-Regardless the reason I'll still find the strength to go on 
-Standing on the rooftop ready to fall , I'm on the edge I could be wrong 
-Lets take this < PROPMALE > and jump to the next trick 
-I never would have thought I would run into someone that actually hated me . Its somewhat funny 
-Though I keep running , I need to slow down to plan my next trick 
-If the power of implanting false memories were true then I would constantly question reality to no end 
-Somethings from the past can brighten new ideas for the future 
-Life is making more sense everytime I get up in the morning 
-Just figuring things as they go by , step by step 
-I just woke up from an awesome 2 hour nap , but I realize my window was down and its raining ! when did it just start ! 
-Damn why does House and Heroes have to be on at the same time ! 
-Yay for hulu having Heroes streaming tomorrow and House next Monday 
-Time to change the pace and kick it up one more notch 
-I doubt I could be that answer for the questions you still have 
-What a depressing day this has been . Luckily in 30 minutes its a new day 
-Even with a certain amount of discilpine and < PROPFEMALE > I'm still making mistakes that are costing me more and more regret and anger 
-Though past mistakes have made me regret and learn , it's what made me on who I am and how I see the world . Constantly changing opinion , trying to do what we see is right from wrong , and ultimately looking for an answer to life and how to live without regrets . That is who I am ... what about yourself 
-Even with the smallest accomplishment we can feel invincible 
-Maybe that dream I had might actually come true 
-Dreaming the reality , Living in an illusion 
-Our shoulders bear an awful weight but we still trudge on just the same because we have the strength to go on . 
-We'll < PROPFEMALE > on , We'll < PROPFEMALE > on ... 
-Overall the rise and fall I will < PROPFEMALE > on with this strength and move onward 
-Blending in the background so you won't notice me is just my escape but really at what cost 
-Life ; Ever changing and adapting , but in order to change what we want , maybe we have to remember on who we were to figure out what we want to be 
-Life ; What a gift it is , so precious and short lived , and yet we take it for granted each day we live in a routine of safety and untaken chances . 
-Reality ; Something that exists through our preception of all other things and how we view the world for what it may be and what it can contain . 
-Purpose ; The reason for which something exists or is done , maded , used , or intended . Why exactly am I here ? For what purpose do I really gain from this , and yet I look back on my life and see all the friends and lives I've shared some shard of knowledge to and wonder did I effect anyone at all 
- < PROPFEMALE > ; Something that is or has happened for a reason to a particular person . Is it really set in stone or is it really effected by our chooses we make throughout our lives ... 
Perception ; An act of understanding means of the senses or mind . I can finally understand why someone would think my way of solving problems can be flawed , but it flawed because it seems to me it's impossible to please everyone so at the cost of my happiness I choose to let others have theirs . 
- < PROPFEMALE > ; Something that is or has happened for a reason to a particular person . At one point in our lives we believe we can cast our own stones and others we believe it is set in stone ... 
-Perception ; An act of understanding means of the senses or mind . We look at people with some expectations by the way they interact with one another , but unlike most I try not to see something for what it is but what it could be . 
-Searching ; examining carefully or thoroughly . As humans we search for purpose and meaning . Sometimes we feel low about life and think its going wrong , as I see them and feel the same way and I have to put my own sadness behind for now to help those that are lower than me raise so they feel like they are on top of the world . 
-Illusion ; Something that deceives by producing a false or misleading impression of reality . It is an < PROPMALE > by not how the caster does it but by the audience preceiving it 
-Scenario ; An outline of the plot of a dramatic work , giving particulars as to the scenes , characters , situations . Though I have planned for different situations I realized that I can't be prepared for everything , so I realize now that in my mind things change good and bad I just need to learn to adapt instead . 
-Past ; Gone by or having existed before . At this point I feel I need to leave the past in the past and just live in the present and dream the future 
-Though things don't go as planned it will work out in the long run ... Luckily mispreception of cards is a great way to entertain . 
-Mistake ; An error in action , calculation , opinion , or judgment caused by poor reasoning , carelessness , insufficient knowledge . As humans we all make them . We freak out at the first sign of it , and yet we preach its alright and that we can learn from it . 
Damn why must I wait just a little bit longer for my classes be available to me ... -_- 
Funny how I am told I got a choice but it is limited 
Lies ; an inaccurate or false statement . We all tell them , to either protect or avoid someone . Sometimes when we make them , they turn into a plot that can be obviously known as false . If you didn't want to see me a simple no is alright 
-Knowing others is intelligence , Knowing yourself is wisdom , Mastering others is strength , Mastering yourself is true power . 
-As I walk out and cast my own stones of fate and < PROPFEMALE > I look back at my \Set in stone\ " prophecy for guidance and inspiration to make the right choices . " 
-As I sat there I asked myslef \Why am I here again with old friends\ " and I hoped things were different but a cruel realization came and said \ " That was the past and some things are suppose to be let go ... \"" 
-As I think about my past and regret some of the things I've done , it made me realize that there were bright lights from there that has made me who I am today 
-Sometimes its just nice to have a day to myself without any interuptions or distractions . Maybe then I can figure things through 
-Shift reality and do something magical . 
-At this point it feels like I just need to let go . 
-Even the simplest concept can bring an interesting effect . 
-Let's not always believe what we percieve . Remember it can be a misdirection of the illusion . 
-When that diffcult task is presented to us , most panic under the condition and become stress . Though when our attitude about the situation is at its best that is when we can the brightest outcome . 
-Interesting how thing won't go as planned and yet get the result we longed for in the end . 
-Why fear the uncertain future ? We also act as if it's written in stone , and yet we express that we have the choice in the matter . We vaguely plan out what will happen tomorrow , next week , next year . Though we know it may and may not happen as we hope . Let's not fear what we don't know . 
- < PROPFEMALE > has a funny way of repaying me . For having a busy day at work and paying for my expenses . I can somewhat feel tomorrow will be easier than I ordinally planned 
-Why try , so hard for all the things we do , Sit back , relax and the thing will come naturally to you . Though we are lost in this illusion . No worries in reality there's always a solution . 
-One may have good eyes and yet see nothing at all . Keep an open mind to the possibilities around us rather than stick firmly to what we believe . 
-I never would have thought that I'd get to that point where I wish the people of my past would just go away . 
-Reimagine reality and bring the possibilites to new heights 
-Interesting on how well I have been doing these past couple days . Aced a speech and a test , but it feels like somethings got to go wrong cause I'm feeling too good . 
-Life's simple , We make choices and don't look back . And yet we still do because of our damn fear and regret we suffer from . 
-No reason to give up now . I guess I'm going down swinging 
-Wow I can't believe it but I'm actually bored out of my mind right now . 
-Sometimes we just have to take a < PROPMALE > to find out what we really want in life . Though we have to remember who we were in order to know what we want to be . 
-The answer won't come to us until we actually seek it . 
-Bored once again and needing some new material for a card trick . 
-Interesting how I quickly I disappear from someone's mind and thinking to myself how insignificant my actions are . 
-I can't believe what happened tonight . Maybe things happen for a reason that needs to be seeked and where the answer lie in the unknown . 
-Looks like I'm heading home . Hope you guys that see this have a Happy Thankgiving and that I am grateful to know friends like you . 
-Everyone that has met me as some point in time really had an impact on who I am today , regardless if you believe your actions were insiginicant 
-Interesting way to spend Thanksgiving ... Eating Ice cream , watch House in my room til everyone gets back from their lunchs ... Halfway boring and lonely 
-Wow , that's one way to make me feel insigificant . Maybe I should do a dissappearing act ... 
-No more regrets , no more worries . I'm going to take a chance ... and alter perceptions . 
-Things are looking brighter with each passing day . 
-I'm back at Hills . Weekend was better than I first thought it was going to be . 
-As the world spins on by , I know I got to try . Though I wish I knew what to do , So I don't be that silent fool ... 
-Inspiration is a funny thing . Anything could set it off : New motivation , new ideas , and friends . I think I'm in the process of making a new trick 
-Just performed 3 tricks for my roommate and had good ( expected ) results . I'm glad this new one works 
-Nothing is coming to mind but I'll get the idea soon . 
-Interesting how poker players play the hand that they are dealt . The Magician on the other hand is always in control . 
-Funny how no matter how hard I try I keep failing and making myself look like an idiot . 
-\In Control\ " is one I've made and its ready to be performed . " 
-This is interesting but that's life ; Live , Learn , Forget , and Remember 
-I realized that our choices has a consequence . I also know that we fear the unknown and yet plan for whatever outcome with happen . At this point though I can fullly comprehend what I do and almost not fear what might happen . Hm I guess that's what everyone calls taking a risk . 
-A little fear is good . It's what makes us feel human , vulnerable , but we have the strength to move past it . 
-Everything is everything . The more I talk about it the less I do control . 
-Just got to take that < PROPMALE > , perform the unexpected . 
-I'm glad I know that some chances are worth taking , I'm just hoping what's on their mind is the same of what I think and feel . 
-I'm looking to the sky to save me , Looking for a sign of life , Looking for something to help me burn out bright 
-After studying this < PROPMALE > change I realized how genious it really is ! I can't wait to actually master it ... 
-Our dreams are worth fighting for . Don't let fear or anyone get in the way of what we want . Just believe , The Possibilities are Endless , and Miracles can happen in a flash . 
-Today has been interesting . Though I feel whatever may happen I got to keep my head up and keep moving . 
-Interesting how our perception of reality can change with the smallest amount of knowlegde ... 
-A smile is the best way to get away with trouble and harm , even if it is a fake one ... It's quite good fooling others .. 
-I feel the chaos around me , A thing I don't try to deny , I'd better learn to accept that , There are things in my life that I can't control 
-After a fast pace weekend I kinda wish for an easy week . 
-I wish I could make things right , and take control of my fate and help those that matter the most but it seems I'm still just a child living in an idle dream of heroics and chivalry . 
-I feel like I can disappear into this abyss , I've lost so much , I hope I am missed . I don't understand why I did the things I do , I wish I could make it up to you 
-As I spread my wings I look up and try to fly to my dreams , Who knew when I got there I'd be freefalling without a care , As the world spins on by I wish I would have tried , As I crash land here and close my eyes and say my last prayer . 
-I told someone that they always had a choice in the ending they want . I see now that they aren't the only ones to have that choice as well . I guess this is what we call having hope . 
-The reason that we fall is to learn to pick ourself up again , With that in mind I can't give up now because once I do I'll just be another face in the crowd . 
-The past is in the past . Let's keep moving forward to the bright future . Things seem to happen for one reason or another . 
-Forever is a long long time , when you lost your way . But when you follow your ideals , is it such a waste ? 
-Life ; What a gift it is , so precious and short lived , and yet we take it for granted each day we live in a routine of safety and untaken chances . Why not break that mold and take our risks and chances . 
-I truly realize now that I should just disappear until the fact I can truly understand someone else's perspective . But right now I feel I shouldn't be here at all ... 
-My eyes are open but I'm blind to see the true pain I inflicted ... 
-Purpose ; The reason for which something exists or is done , maded , used , or intended . Why exactly am I here ? For what purpose do I really gain from this , and yet I look back on my life and see all the friends and lives I've shared some shard of knowledge to and wonder did I help anyone at all or just made things worse in reality 
-If something is truly important to you then keep fighting to achieve that dream , don't let anyone or anything stand in your way . Because ' thinking ' of doing the right thing is easy , but really ' doing ' the right thing is the hard part . 
-Listening to music , Practicing some card tricks , and Researching a new one that caught my eye . I'm feeling good about tonight and hope everyone else has a good night . 
-I truly realize now that I did my part in helping those that I care about and that they no longer need me hanging around . I can see their wings spread across the open sky as they follow their dreams . I guess this was my true sacrifice when it was time for me to let them go . Live , Learn , Forget and Remember . 
-One of the many paradoxes of human existence is that we feel invinicible and vulnerable at the same instant . Sometimes , we seem to be capable of bearing almost anything but at the same time only a few harsh words can tear us apart . We then start to question if we're really as good or as strong as we think we are . I guess the basic kindness we can do is just protect the sense of value and strength in otheres . 
-I've played my part . It's almost sad that its over but hey that's life , things don't change , we do . As the days pass we live and learn knowing that each day changes us . Good or bad , when it happens we shift our perspective on who we are . 
-A kind action is done with careful consideration and meant to bring happiness to the person , the best ones are done unseen , the downside is that no ones who who did it but the true reward is knowing you did the \right\ " thing " 
-Just one < PROPMALE > is all I ever wanted , Just one time I liked to win the game , From now on I'll take the < PROPMALE > if I can have it . Just give me one last wish , because there's a world out there as long as I keep moving on . 
-I'm now inspired to study cardistry to make my routines more artsy 
-Damn Fortune dealt me a bad hand , Luckily I know to swap the cards for a flush haha . Today's still going to be a good day . 
-I've never seen so many gifts that need wrapping ... I don't want to see another present til Christmas . Time for a nap 
-Quick review for my test and the praticing some card flourishes 
-Now I question about the world I know , and the difference between real and show . Some where between fact and fiction , we'll master the mystery of illusion . 
-Luck must be on my side once again , because I have a good feeling about today . 
-Living in this blissful illusion , Dreaming the dream , and Smile at reality . 
-Break from the mold , I got sureshot way to work this out , all this growing up has wore you down , I got a sureshot way to kill your doubts , find what your following and < PROPMALE > it down . 
-Trust your feelings , got to live and learn . I know with some luck that I'll make it through , Time's on my side I know what to do . 
-In order to have a life of happiness , one must take in each day at a time and < PROPFEMALE > the moments ; In order to have a life of purpose , one must focus on the future and plan for that destination ; Though I question myself each day ' Why can't I have both ? ' 
-Out of sight , out of mind , I know time is on our side , Taking these dreams and making them come alive . 
-Turn your sadness into kindness , your uniqueness into your strength , If your feeling down , look up and start dreaming . 
-As a Fighting Dreamer we aim high , we believe and just go our own way . 
-The blissful silence of the cool winter night is peaceful with the stars and < PROPFEMALE > being so bright . I close my eyes with a smile knowing somewhere out there I have a purpose with a shining light . 
-Looking back on the pictures of my past , I wishing my friendships had last . 
-Every choice has its reason behind it when picked and the outcome maybe known . Regradless of the reason and outcome , we just have to take a < PROPMALE > and see what happens in the meantime . 
-Time is on our side with many things in our life , but our < PROPFEMALE > will be tested time and time again . 
-Looking at these stars and dream , Going through this stream of memories . Knowing now where we stand , I have a feeling I'm going to be lost in this sand of time . 
-Good will and good cheer to the world out there 
- < PROPFEMALE > Christmas to all , especially to my friends and the people I've met in my past that is a gift I will forever < PROPFEMALE > . 
-Most people say time is like a river , that flows swift and sure in one direction . But I have seen the face of time , and I can tell you , they are wrong . Time is an ocean in a storm . Constantly changing like the tides 
-Plagued by < PROPFEMALE > where our fate lies unchangable , and yet with hope we take control and cast our own stones instead of it being written in it . 
-To have self-control and do what is necessary takes time , energy , and < PROPFEMALE > to do it right . 
-As the year draws to a close I look back with a smile of my past mistakes and keep moving forward to the new year 
Just had the greatest epiphany at 1:01 am on 1/1/11 . I can't wait to start filming this . 
-Life is what we make of it . It always has been and always will be . 
-There are many ways to define our existants , many ways to give it meaning but its our memories that give it purpose and context . 
-I never really thought I had a < PROPMALE > and I don't think ever I will but the fact that I keep trying is all I ever need 
-So unsure where my future lies , I'm starting to think my role is nothing more than to seek answer due to Human Nature and Curiosity 
-My bad habit of planning ahead has put me in a bind now . 
-With each passing moment we learn wisdom and strength , but it comes to memories we left behind all the way back to the flow of time , we forgot how to leave it in the past . 
-In this dull boring world , charm it with an amazing show . Live a Dream one by one 
-This one last bullet you mention , is my last shot of redemption . 
Gotta get up , get up , We cant give up this fight now , Gotta stand up , stand up , For what we believe in our hearts , Gotta wake up wake up , From the illusion of our misery , Gotta break out break out , From this reality and fly with me . 
-We got one shot , one < PROPMALE > , to change the world with our hands . I got one thing to say , We live our lives like we live our days 
-This new outlook has been making things easier . I regret ever asking for a lighter burden instead of border shoulders . 
-Damn is it me or is this day draging on 
-Today seems to be a good day for a tennis session , dinner , magic routine practice , then a movie . 
-In 12 days , I will have to wait to see my improvment from 2 months ago ... 
-11 Days , Though I feel like I'm back at square one , I am really where I need to be , Re-learning , Re-Inventing , Continuing towards perfection . 
-So far today has been good I got to < PROPFEMALE > out with my favorite people , even though it was few hours . 
-10 Days , It seems each passing day has had its specific purpose that it wants me to see . Today it kept reminding me that the possibilites are truly endless , regradless of the fact that I believe I'm in control 
-8 Days , Embrace each day and begin it with a purpose in mind 
-6 Days , Sometimes all you need is the right mind set to take on anything 
-4 Days , The complexity and possiblities that are in our lives has me in awe 
-3 Days , I never thought I'd be at this point in any stage of my life . Surprises are around every corner and though we look up at the sky for answers when we finally look back down it seems the answer was in front of us the entire time ... 
-2 Days , When will I ever learn that life isn't as predictable as I think and should just plan for the moment . 
-1 Day , I never thought positive reinforcement could feel so good . Thanks 
-Anything can happen , the closer you get to something the tougher it is to see it . I'll never take it for granted .. let go ... 
-It doesn't matter now what happens . I will never give up the fight . Long as the voice inside drives me to run and fight . It doesn't matter who is wrong and who is right ! 
-Can you feel life going through your mind , what about time flowing through your spine , is your head tangled up inside ... Live and Learn , Forget and Remember . 
-I thought what I've learned was good enough but it turns out it was only the tip of an iceberg to a whole to place ... a new world to explore 
-I'm having this uneasy feeling looming over my head ... I'm wondering if its something that has happened or that will happen ... 
-How do we justify our own purpose , is it the things we say . or do . What makes life truly significant 
-There's only life and pain that makes who we are . We are all afraid to understand the impossible .. 
-I can understand why I'm filled with fear , It's cause I question myself what am I doing here ... 
-Make the impossible happen and think outside the ordinary .. 
-What can I close with leaving them in awe 
-There's always a choice , its just the results we have to live with 
-I guess my best isn't good enough because I couldn't achieve what I wanted 
-It's not what you do , it's how you do it 
-Once again I'm stop by this wall and I have two choices , one I turn around and find another way out of this maze or two I cut the corners and break down this wall . 
-My life has been nothing more than a freefall of memories and one of these days I'm going to wake up and realize something life changing , either bad or good . 
-We are the products of our experiences , the choices we make reflect us on who we are and what we value . 
-This term has definitely opened my eyes but a cost : Probably lost a friend because of my pride , Lost some respect because I can't say no , and probably lost interest because I lost sight what I was doing it for . But regardless of the reasons life's full of mistakes to learn from 
-Something tells me that the answers are right in front of me , I'm a < PROPMALE > blind to see it . 
-We all have the abilitiy to do anything . The only thing holding us back is ourselves 
-The people I choose to have around me ultimately reflects my character in the long run . 
-Though I'm falling down I know I can rise above this doubt 
-Looks like I got lost in the back of my mind . Losing the concept of the sands of time . I know I'm not going alone but I'll never give up 
-Keep going when your mind says quit , Keep dreaming til you find you're living it . When you look around for a helping hand . I'll be there waving from the stands 
-Believe what you will because that is your reality 
-Keep your eyes on that mountain top , One step at a time and don't ever ever stop 
-A secret of life is having the pleasure of being terribly deceived . Believing a lie to form reality but within that reality comes illusions 
-I think I hit a wall where I don't see the point anymore . Something's off but can't put my finger on it 
-Things that were once unclear and now coming into focus , revealing a new possibility 
-With one goal done I still have many others to accomplish . No time worry because time seems to be on my side 
-Haha supposively my magic is the work of Quantum mechanics .. I don't think I know a mechanic ... Who names their kid Quantum anyways 
-Damnit ... I think my Steam account just got hack ... SHIT ! 
-Looking back on just what happened , I don't think I was mad but just shocked it happened . I'm actually questioning if I ever get mad or I just know it's worthless to complain about the past that can't be changed 
-It always seems that when I look for the solution to a problem it's right in front of me . So when I expect it to be there it's not until I go searching for it . 
-Eh ... School work or Magic ... I guess I'll do some math while listening to a magic lecture . 
-A positive attitude may not always solve the problem but it will definitely keep things in perspective 
-Life is certainly contains unexpected events ... I guess just got to adapt and go with the flow 
-We always have a choice . I just choose what will help in the long run . 
-Doing what's right and doing what we want can go together but there's always a time where in order the right thing we have to give up what we want the most 
-I've done what I thought was interesting , so for the time being its out of my hands to win . But I must say being a finalist is good but going for that gold will be better 
-We constantly search for truth throughout our lives , but for most of the things that are important to us we simply need to believe . 
-Feeling this good I know to trend softly now , because something is bound to happen 
-Though we may not be < PROPMALE > or famous , Hell we may not be important to others than our friends and family but that alone is enough . We all have a legacy to give . 
-Today has been a pretty good day . Lets hope to end on a high note 
-So my performance didn't win . Mad ? Hell no , a little disappointed but glad I was in the final 10 , and the winner being someone that truly deserves it . 
-So many things to focus on ... Maybe my subconscious will tell me with a good nights sleep 
-Looks like I got my answer ... problem now is how to go about it . 
-\People don't see that their opinion of the world is a confession of their character . \"" 
-We've all been sorry , we've all been hurt ... but how we survive .. is what makes us who we are .. 
-Now I've realized one of two things that has happened . One , Through the positive views of the world there was a layer of sorrow to create the feeling of appriecation . 
-Two . I shouldn't complain for the life I have . It could have been worse if I have stopped hoping for a bright future . 
-Interesting how origami can represent our lives . From a piece of paper having many folds , which is our past events and experiences , to create a complex design , that reflects our character . 
-Endless potential is within all of us . Regardless of other's influences , it is all on us to bring it out and show it for what it is . Believe in yourself and your abilities 
-Though I am no where near this new goal . Taking this journey towards it is going to be interesting to say the least . 
-I truly underestimated today . Gave an okay speech . Learned a little bit about some health stuff , and line dancing , interesting to say the least . Performed about 20 minute routine leaving those 3 people speechless . 
-Changing illusion to reality with each performance . Today is a damn good day . 
-Even though I have my bad days , I can always look forward to start the next day with a brighter attitude . 
-84 Made , 916 left , I think I will know once I'm done 
-I'm just one person of many . Though we define our individuality by our actions , emotions , and thoughts ; we all go through the similar path to find what really makes us unique from others . 
-The responsibility is on me . The outcome is one I can control . It always was but I never really understood it until now . 
-I think I have an idea for my next speech but I'm not too sure . Hopefully this will fall into place . 
-As my shoulders < PROPFEMALE > this burden I have to keep moving forward . Because if I'm not going to motivate myself then who . 
-Why see the difficulty in every opportunity ? Believe in yourself and your abilities to see the opportunity in every difficulty . 
-Keep on when your mind says quit , Dream on til you find your living it . I'll be right by your side . Don't stop til you win your prize . I'll be there to help you rise . 
-Rector per vis ultum maioribus quam fortuna . 
-Why stand there dreaming about it ? Why not live it ? Why let fear decide fate for you , why let it dictate who you are . The possibilites are endless , so take control of your own fate . 
After talking to a few friends I decided to give up magic . And it looks like I'm moving to Oklahoma . ( The day keeps getting better ... =/ ) 
Today started out good and turn into shitty day . Practially failing some class , so I need to buckle down and study , so no magic for a while . Moving to Oklahoma because parents career choice , don't know if I'll be going to Hills next year(maybe ) . and I can't find my Ipod . Might have left it at the tennis courts earlier .. great(find it send me a text ) . At least its spring break ... =/ 
-Don't look down , and don't look back , and don't turn around your on the right track . Keep your eyes on that mountain top , One step at a time and don't ever ever stop 
-I think I'm done . I see no point into anymore 
-Things once seemed impossible shed a new light on reality 
-La realtà non è sempre ciò che sembra 
-Why am I so apathic with my own well being that I constantly say \Better me than someone else\ " with troubles I run into " 
-I'm not going to lie but I pretty much rock . Haha 
-Out of sight , Out of mind 
-Someday you'll figure it out , and once you do you can't help but smile 
-559 left to go , looking into an interesting speech topic , and finally try to solve this damn puzzle . 
-In my defense he was shooting at me first ! Hahaha Good times 
-All it took was one look , 3 key words , and your response . I knew exactly what was going on in your mind . I just don't know how to response back for the positive reinforcement you need 
-True discovery isn't in new landscapes or things but in a new outlook and an open mind 
-Act as if what you do makes a difference . It does . 
-Don't follow your dreams ... Chase them . 
-Things are set . Only thing left is to wait just a few more moments 
-Believing in something and having enthusiasm for if makes life worth living 
Congratulations , You've successfully made me feel insignificant . I would insult you back for your inept intelligence but that would make me be in the same inferior level as you . 
-Another step closer but it feels like I haven't made any progress 
-At least I'm breathing , At least I'm alive , As long as I'm dreaming everythings going to be alright 
-I think I'm going to be winging tomorrow . Knowing my luck these pass couple of days I'll be alright 
-Focus one thing at a time and I'll make it through the day . 
-Believe you can make a difference , and you will 
-It's funny how I constantly doubt my ability but once I perform and hear the comments later makes me wonder why I doubt myself in the first place . 
-Better to light one small candle than to curse the darkness . 
-What lies behind us and what lies before us are < PROPFEMALE > matters compared to what lies within us . 
-Our greatest moments aren't the ones where we never fail , but the ones that we rise up everytime we fall 
-I can't believe on how many enemies I've made for just trying to do the right thing . 
-Things will be alright no need to feel down , tomorrow's another day , new opportunities are waiting 
-In order for me to know where I'm going I need to find out where I've been .. 
-Life will knock us down but we can choose to get back up and go on 
-I honestly wish I handled that so much better but really enough was enough 
-We all have 86,400 seconds in a day to make something of ourselves or throw away the opportunity . Each second does count 
-Life is either a daring adventure or nothing , so make it count 
-One choice changes everything .. 
-The things we do defines us . 
-We are our own worst judges , I guess that's why I can't see my own potential 
-Yesterday's history , Tomorrow's mystery , Today's a gift ... that's why they call it the Present . 
If you can imagine it you can achieve it . If you can dream it , you can become it . 
-What I do today is important because I am exchanging a day of my life for it 
-It is our choices that show what we truly are , far more than our abilities 
-These last couple days have been amazing . I'm so grateful for this hobby ; Meeting new people and making friends , creating opportunities that were once dreams now into reality , and seeing things in a whole new light . I'm very excited to be performing at The Studio next week . Wish me luck and thanks to those who enjoy watching my < PROPMALE > of Magic 
-I am one individual among many , the only diffence from me to the others is what ever you perceive of me . 
-Who knew that 15 minutes of complete silence and drifting thoughts can be so relaxing 
-Greatness is in all of us . It's just the matter of knowing where to look 
-We are all faced with a series of opportunities in our lives they are just cleverly disguised as impossible situations 
-Dream what you want to dream ; go where you want to go ; be what you want to be , because you have only one life and one < PROPMALE > to do all the things you want to do . 
-If you limit your choices only to what seems possible or reasonable , you disconnect yourself from what you truly want , and all that is left is compromise 
-To accomplish great things , we must dream as well as act . It does not lie in where we have lived or the people we know , but the actions we have done that should be of interest . 
-Most \ 
of the shadows of this life are caused by \ 
standing \ 
in our own sunshine . Embrace the opportunity 
-Life is a succession of moments ; To live each one is a success . Tonight was certainly one of those moments . 
-Whatever my choice is now , it will be in the past . 
-Some believe in < PROPMALE > , others call it < PROPFEMALE > , I redefine it as the outcome of our choices 
-When one door closes another one is opening . So right here right now I'll take this opportunity as a new start . 
-Life has no limitations , except the ones you make 
-With these last moments I spend it like I do everyday . Put on my headphones , get pumped and perform something unbelievible . I'll see most of my friends in the near future . Have a good one guys ! 
-So everyone is gone and once again I stand alone . This isn't bad , it's just the tranquility I need to re-evaluate what has happened . 
-I can dream for miracles , but I will do what I need to do to make good things happen 
-Today feels like a damn good day . Too bad I slept most of the morning . Oh well 12 hours to do something productive 
-I once told someone \The Possibilites are endless\ " so they wouldn't stop believing in themselves . Because the moment we stop doing so is the moment we lose ourselves . Even though we give up from time to time ; we all have greatness in us . The puzzle is where to look " 
-We create our fate everyday we live . 
-Be renewed every morning , for each day is a new life , a fresh world , the beginning of your journey 
-I look around at the people I've interacted with and I must say that we are all very similar . Though we define ourselves as unique individuals , we mirror one another . I think there is more to coincidence , but really fate that we all meet , but it is choice that we become friends . 
-Though I may have missed an opportunity , my Will is strong enough to open the door to a hundred new ones . The only thing worse than \a quitter\ " is a person afraid to begin . Make each moment what it's meant to be . " 
-Though I looks like a long journey in front of me , I cannot complain for each step I take gets me closer to my goal 
-Those written words are spinning around in my head and I can't stop smiling about it . Today has been productive , easy-going , just overall great . 
-Nothing more to say but its a new day with new opportunities 
-To enter\ 
every activity without giving mental recognition to the possibility of\ 
defeat ; Concentrate on your strengths , instead of your weaknesses ... on\ 
your powers , instead of your problems , and then we can achieve what we dream into reality . 
Wow my focus is sucks right now and it feels like I'm not really doing anything productive ... eh Fail 
-Let the rain keep fallin down , cuz with won't stop me from getting I'm bound , yea maybe I'm crazy , maybe it's too late , But I'm gonna make it , don't care what the skies say 
Great friends , funny videos , good times priceless 
-Even with these clipped wings , I'm sure I'll find a way to fly 
-I honestly don't what to believe now , but I know that complaining will get me no where so I'll just let the pieces fall into place 
\George is my cool Asian Friend\ " hahah I like it " 
-I see no use in fighting or complaining about it anymore . 
-So letting go isn't that easy , I'm hanging on but I'm growing cold while my mind is leaving 
I'm not a man of too many faces \ 
The mask I wear is one , Those who speak know nothing \ 
And find out to their cost , \ 
Like those who curse their luck in too many places , \ 
And those who fear are lost 
-Am I really that naive to believe that there is good in everyone even though some of their past actions accuse them of being a bad person ? 
-I may be soaked but that was probably the most peaceful moment I've had all day . Standing in that rain just made most of those worries wash away 
-Drifting in the cooling breeze surrounded by tranquility . A calm before a storm 
-To use my downfalls , my mistakes , my flaws as my stepping stones will make me either bitter and cold or enlightened and hopeful 
-This is just another moment in that knot we all have in our thread of life . Its been an interesting day . 
-There are some that live in a dream , others reside in reality . Only few can turn one into the other ... 
-Do not lose hold of your dreams or aspirations . For if you do , you may still exist but you have ceased to live . 
-Life will knock us down but we can choose to get back up 
-Being happy doesn't mean that everything is perfect . It means that you've decided to look beyond the imperfections . 
-Good Morning , Good Evening , I hope you like dreamin ' , You live to learn and you learn to live , It's positive and negative , I can't sleep but I dream big . 
Damn no magic for a while cause I cut my thumb ... fail :( 
So I realized there are some people I may not like but that really doesn't mean I don't like them just means I have no reason to like them yet . I hope that clarified that situation 
Nothing like Pandora , youtube vids , and chocolate milk to end the day 
-If I can be like that , well I would give anything , just to live one day 
-A lesson without pain is meaningless ; For we can't gain something without sacrificing something else in return .. 
-Hard to keep perspective when your eyes won't close , Its hard to stand tall when your already on your toes .. 
-I can't bring peace of mind to anyone unless I learn to have peace of mind myself . 
-Lost ? Keep looking til something looks familiar ; Doesn't work ? Start walking til something does . 
-Constantly questioning who am I , Wearing masks and telling lies , The world is spinning fast , Any day could be my last . 
-No longer in isolation on these days , causes my own damnation if chooses to stay , each day is a new life for change to see , find that inner peace within me . 
-We all have the ability to change the course of the future , regardless how insignificant we believe we are . 
-We all dare to dream , but so many of us hestiate to make them reality . Why let fear of failure hold us back ? 
Not to brag but getting a free meal when you perform 3 or 4 magic effects shows how good I am . Helps when you got one of the coolest waitress serving you and brings her manager and co-workers to witness it too . I kinda feel sorry for my friends that had to pay for their meals . 
-In our lives we have many choices . But to choose well , you must know who you are and what you stand for , where you want to go and why you want to get there . 
-It's always the littliest things that give the most potential 
I dawned on me that I have a performance tomorrow ... and no set routines decisions decisions . Anyone know which effects to do ? 
Am I seriously sitting here watching \Tom and Jerry\ " ? Shit you got to love the classic cartoony violence " 
Well I'm heading to work but I'll leave with a quote\ 
-As we continue walk along this journey never forget the reason why took that first step or we might miss that sliver-lining in the sky . 
-Another day of sunshine , awesome because I have like 3 events to attend today and performing for at least 2 of them 
Ok one last party to get to hopefully this will end well . I'm feeling tired but have enough to perform well 
So Happy Birthdays to < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > Rusch(Sasha < PROPMALE > ) . I had a fun time hangout with both and I'm glad I had a < PROPMALE > to entertain this week for you guys . 
-I've realized I have no reason to be upset , sad or angry with friends like these . To the new friends I've met , and the old ones that remain . YOU are awesome . 
Miscommunication is funny .. and very annoying hahah 
-Though we will have our missed opportunities , they create new chances ; for everything we lose , we gain something in return 
I've been sitting around planning so I believe its time to set some of them in motion . If all goes well then the future looks pretty bright , if not then new opportunities will happen in its place . 
So far so good , had a day being stress-free and I'm ready to finish this week with a little magic . 
-Got this feeling you can't fight , like the city is on fire tonight , this could reallly be a good life . 
-All worries drift away to the many seas , nothing more but the tranquility . 
-We are our own authors of our stories ; We control certain fates and actions , and have the power to make the ending simple and elegant or something extraordinary . So tell me what's your story 
So I have 16 hours to prepare some routines for a wedding dinner , and within those 16 hours I need to perfect a new effect that is still a little shaky ... I'm thinking this will be an interesting time crunch 
Damn I laugh and hate how I can give great advice to those that need it but when I'm in a pinch I'm just lost . Looks like I need to start walking 
Well its now or never I would ask wish me luck but we all know I don't need it ;) 
Though some of my performances are shaky ; I'm doing excellent I guess I got to thank those that wished me luck . You guys are awesome friends ! 
At the end of the day , I'm like everyone else . I look in the mirror and question what I see , what I could be , and where am I going 
-With each day being a new day , we all have another < PROPMALE > to change the world . For better or for worst , its our choice . 
-The harsh reality of the < PROPMALE > of Magic is this ; After performing something magical , They'll beg and praise me for the secret , and as soon as I give it up ... I'll be worth nothing to them . And even if keeping it from them I'll still be worth nothing to them . 
If what I dreamt were to come true then I must say I'll be please to live that life and die that way . 
-One more opportunity to go for the gold . I will put everything into the persentation and performance . I may lose , I may win . I will never know if I don't try . 
-This might be one of my trickiest situations . I'll pull it off so clean it will look crazy 
-Great opportunities disguised as impossible situations . Fair enough I'll overcome the hurdle . 
who's dominating ? I am , suck it bitches .. nah I kid the ignorant people 
-Success means having the courage , the determination , and the will to become the person you believe you were meant to be . 
Hahah This turned into an interesting ordeal . 
-With Time comes experience and practice . I wonder where I will stand within one year's time 
Another day where isolation takes over . 
\The\ 
Where are the good friends when you need them ? hmm 
-The world knows the true and the secret behind it , but it wants to be fooled anyways . Because if you can fool them then you make them wonder .. and believe .. and think that anything .. is possible ... 
-Most of the time I just wonder how big of a difference I made . Then I look back to all the people I've interacted with and see some were insignificant and other life changing . 
-Anything can be accomplished if we put our selfishness aside . 
-My job is to create a moment of wonder . From there its up to you where we go 
I got to say this presentation seems to be good but I'll never know until I perform . Who wants to be the spectators haha 
-What am I really doing this for . Is it for myself or for others . Or maybe theres a bigger meaning in this that I can't see yet 
-Maybe ... just maybe there's hope for me yet 
-I'm prepared to die but there is no reason for I am prepared to kill . 
-All I am is one of many , significant or meanless , its up to the person that looks in my direction . 
-Sometimes it's choice , not < PROPMALE > , that determines your < PROPFEMALE > . 
-One thought influences feeling , That feeling will influence an action , and that one action can very well change the world . All it took was one thought . 
-Eh I'm just another guy that has a pack of cards . All I do is cut fancy and shuffle flashy . No big =P 
-No great thing is created suddenly .. 
-It's hard to say what legacy I will leave behind once I'm long gone . 
-Sometimes a moment can change things . Retaliation of an enemy , realization of the truth , or the betrayal of a life-long friend . It is always the smallest moments that change the future . 
-My legacy I'll leave behind . Easy it's .. 
SCOREBOARD !! SCORE BOARD !! Blu team undefeated ! Aww was that your friend , I knew him , I killed him and he cried like a bitch !! 
Off to work , This day feels pretty good so peaceful and relaxing . 
-I just don't what to do anymore . It's almost hopeless .. almost 
-I'd rather have a mind open to wonder than one closed by belief 
-\Why were you nice to that guy ? \ " \ " Because I can see he's miserable and I don't know him so I have no reason to add to his misery . \"" 
-The past looks better than it was . It's only pleasant because it isn't here . 
-I wish I can figure out why I'm so frusterated lately . 
-I've never felt this hateful and regretful before . What am I doing . 
-Our perspective can enhance our experience of the world ... or distorts it . There's always a choice 
-7 Years can change someone . The first two years makes someone feel worthless and very depressed , the next three are hard to accept and move on . These last two makes one feel how could I live like this without them . Through the good and bad I will do my best and continue living . 
-Change your thoughts and you can change your world 
-Damnit I realize I haven't filmed any of my contest entry . Anyone willing to help ... you get to see a magic trick ^_^ 
-A strong mind bares the harshest reality 
-One may have good eyes but see nothing at all 
-I will love the light for it will lead me the way , yet I will endure the darkness for it will show me the stars 
So I'm on campus hanging out . Going to try and film for my contest entry . This should be a good day 
-It's really what a person thinks of themselves that determines their own fate . 
Believe all things are possible 
-Knowlegde and wisdom have no value unless you put them into practice 
-Keep it secret , Keep it safe . People will beg and praise you for the secret . And the moment you give it up you are nothing to them . 
-To the world you may be one person , but to one person you may be the world 
-There\ 
is no value in life except what you choose to place upon it and no \ 
happiness in any place except what you bring to it yourself . 
-Our lives improve only when we\ 
take chances and the first and most difficult risk we can take is to be\ 
honest with ourselves . 
Curious what I think about you ? Like this status and I'll tell you . 
-Time flows through like a breeze , leaving behind an awe-inspiring moment in its wake . 
God White Collar and Lie to Me must be the most awesome series EVER ! 
-Hope is precious ; Even with darkness surrounding , don't lose hope because at the end of it all you will see the light . And though I may not be your guide out I'll be there with an arm reaching out to help . 
-It takes one positive thought , when given a < PROPMALE > to survive , to overpower an entire army of negatives . 
Uploading vlogs and napping thats my day so far 
-Truly great friends are hard \ 
to find , difficult to leave , and impossible to forget . 
Well today seems to be a boring day .. the only interesting I've done was make a card mural on my wall ... I'll have a picture of it once its done =) 
God why does it feel like a disappearing act sounds so good right now ... =/ 
-Opportunities are around us ... Where will you be when it strikes . 
-Tragic\ 
as it is when you work hard , and do your good deeds and when you need \ 
help and really need it ... people just let you hang .. I won't make that mistake and I apologize if I ever have 
So much planning ... calculating .. If I can foresee anything that would be these next few weeks will hold something ... interesting ^_^ 
-So the concept for tomorrow ... things will fall in its place .. Man I'm so hyped for these next few weeks ! 
-I am certain that whatever hardships and obstacles that loom over us , our Will will endure and an awe-inspiring moment will triumph ... 
-Things can't be set in stone if you don't know where to cast the first one . 
-The shadows of our lives are caused by standing in our own sunshine . 
-Interesting lesson I've learned is that no matter what happens or how bad something is today . I know life goes on and tomorrow will be better . 
Haha I'm failing < PROPFEMALE > big right now . And yes it is funny just because ... don't judge . 
-I'll rise above this doubt . A new revolution is about to start 
-Each day is a new < PROPMALE > to do something ... interesting . Anything works . Possibilities are endless . 
-Life is made up of the simplest of pleasures and Happiness is made up of the tiniest of success . < PROPFEMALE > the little things in life . 
-We are free to choose what ever we wish , but we are not free from the consequences of those choices . 
So I can't sleep again and instead of working on magic I'm doing more paper cranes ... Yea too much time on my hands for the moment 
-I hold 52 selections , each unique but I will perform a moment of wonder with your selection . 
I'm not feeling like myself right now .. 
-There are no failures - just experiences and your reactions to them . 
-Being defeated is often a temporary condition . Giving up is what makes it permanent . 
-I should feel no regret because some things happen for a reason . The hard times that we \ 
all endure ultimately builds our character to the world . 
This may very well be my last performance . I don't know I'm just trying to figure stuff out . Though it may be overwhelming now I'm sure I'll find my answers once this is all done . 
-Nothing is wasted and life is worth living ... Just look to the stars 
-Greatness is in all of us . Our job is to know where to look ^_^ 
-Generosity isn't the amount that was given but the manner it was bestowed . 
-No one is worthless in the world that lightens the burden of others ... 
-It is what a person thinks of themselves determines their own fate 
-You can have anything you want if you will give up the belief that you can't have it . 
My past has made me who I am and my future will make me who I will be . For the present I am the result of both , living for a dream and lived for a dream 
-True happiness consists not in the multitude of friends , but in the worth and choice 
-Dreams are like stars ... you may never touch them , but if you follow them they will lead you to your < PROPFEMALE > . 
-To be believable we must be credible , to be credible we must be truthful .. 
-What seems to be impossible tasks are simply blessings in disguise . 
Yea so i'm feeling pretty much worthless right goddamnit . X ( 
-Seek and you shall find ... the world invites deception ... 
-A dreamer can find their way by moonlight and is punished when they see < PROPFEMALE > before the rest of the world 
-People may forget what was said , People may forget what was done , but They will not forget what you made them feel 
-One move , One moment , One thought , One action can truly change .. everything 
-\The difference between an \ 
-\To leave the world a better place .. to know that one life breathed easier because you lived .. \ " That's is the legacy I strive to achieve " 
-Anyone can give up .. It's the easiest thing to do . But to hold it together when everyone around you says you will fall is true strength 
-Some pursue happiness .. others create it ... and few .. give it 
-Character is what you know you are , not what others think of you 
-We are destined for great things . The actions may be small but they will mean something to someone . 
\George it's alright your not hurt\ " \ 
-Time goes by so fast , people go in and out of your life . You must never miss the opportunity to tell these people how much they mean to you 
So my phone does not have a signal in Albia .. Fail . Reason I'm here is because my awesome family ! Kimmi and < PROPFIRST > are great letting me crash here and < PROPFEMALE > out . I'll be in Fairfield tomorrow ... maybe I got some other stops to make . 
-Doubt can destroy someone for the inside out . But with friends that have your back and believe in you , anything is possible . Thanks guys 
-I close my eyes and what I see is 3 doors . 
-Everyone has a light that shines bright like any < PROPFEMALE > , the only thing to do is give it a < PROPMALE > 
-I just have this feeling that my actions hasn't made a difference yet . 
-A kind act doesn't cost much but it accomplishes so much 
-Who's to say what's impossible , I guess they forget that the world keeps spinning and starts each new day . 
-I know for a fact I'm going to get knocked down but I believe I'll get back up with a smile every time . 
-Hope may vanish but cannot die . If I can inspire or lighten a burden for at least one person then I've done my job for the day 
-Let the fears and lies melt away 
-My value is the one I give to others and creating something of purpose and meaning . 
Well I'm here at bestbuy performing some magic what else . Good times good reactions ^_^ 
-As much as it would be nice to stay down I got to get back up and < PROPFEMALE > on . Cause if I can't get myself back up , who will ? 
-Our greatest weakness lies in giving up ... The most certain way to succeed is to always try just one more time . I guess there's always one more < PROPMALE > even a slim one 
-I'm sure my role is done . So why continue ... unless there's a bigger picture for me . 
-In this world there is hate , anger , despair , and distrust that is true .. but it is also true that we have a < PROPMALE > to change it with hope , sympathy , ability to dream and believe . 
Sitting here at a magic meeting it is interesting ^_^ 
Back from Des Moines that was great meeting other magicians that work professionally ... I'm still wondering if it is what I'm suppose to do . Then again there's a bigger picture I got to look at . 
Believe me , I'm not gone I'm somewhere in the background helping . Like a \Guardian Angel\ " if you will :P " 
It feels great being back and performing again . I hope my friend is alright 
-Motivation beats mere talent . But when both used together correctly they end up making a stunning achievement . 
To all the people that I've performed for in the past and most likely in the future to . Like this if you have a signed card from me from a magic trick and try and describe that trick I would like to know thanks . Have a great year ! see you around !! 
-The difference between greatness and mediocity is often how one views their mistakes . 
-Reality is an illusion that can change within any moment . Consider me a person that has an unique ability to alter your reality ; making anything possible and creating a moment of wonder . 
-I realize that waiting for certain opportunities is a waste of time . I will take any moment and make them great to the best of my ability . So why wait ? 
-\WHAT ! \ " \ " How did you just do that ! \ " \ " WITCH ! \ " \ " It's the medallion/amulet\ " ... Love those reactions ^_^ " 
-Most of the things we receive is exchanged with that of what we sacrificed 
-Vision without action is a dream . Action without vision is just passing the time . When vision meets action anything is possible 
After talking to a friend they said I should do a magic show . It's on the line of possibility but who would want to show up haha . 
-As I entered this world I cried and the world rejoiced . The moment I leave this world I will rejoice and the world will cry . 
-Free will ; One of the greatest gifts that is bestowed on humanity . The ability to control what happens to us and exactly how it happens . Masters of our own fates and destinies . 
-Free will ; It may very well be an illusion to us all . We may all have our preordained < PROPFEMALE > and no matter how hard we fight or what we do , life will happen to us exactly as it's meant to happen . 
-It is in your moments of decision that your < PROPFEMALE > is shaped 
-Along this path at the end of the light it will be a darkness of the unknown . And as soon as we take that first step two things will happen ; We either find something solid to stand on and continue walking or we learn how to fly . 
Worked with 2 new effects today and I must say they were fun to perform . 
Cruising the streets of Ottumwa and we see a guy getting kicked on the ground by 2 guys . We called the cops but I wanted to jump out and help this kid , Damn I was ready to kick them . 
-I've come to realize that I may never know . I'll either rise above or start sinking 
-We learn more by looking for the answer to a question and not finding it than the answer itself . 
-I try making the best of any opportunity by having the right idealism , willingness to self sacrifice , and a belief that anything is possible . If I lack in any one of these then I'm nothing more than a hypocrite 
-We may not remember the days but we remember the moments . Each moment being so significant that it may effect our character to the world around us . 
-Regardless of the action or words they will mean something to someone somewhere 
Funny how everytime I believe I'm going to give up there is that voice that tells me to give it one more shot , < PROPFEMALE > on that thread for one more minute , get back up and stand strong . And I seem to hold on for one more moment everytime .. 
-The chances of success in anything that we do can be measured by our belief in ourselves 
-Hold tight to those dreams . For without them it would be like a flying with a broken wing unable to get anywhere . 
-I stand here along my path watching the world spin on by . I close my eyes and laugh a little ... then continue walking . 
-No matter how many lives I live , I will never regret , There's a fire inside this heart and a riot about to explode into flames 
-Dreams are like the paints of a great artist . Your dreams are your paints , the world is your canvas . Believing , is the brush that converts your dreams into a masterpiece of reality . 
-We all have the ability to choose what we want to do and do it well , to love what we want in life and love it honestly , to control our own lives for no one else can control it for us . And to have power to make it a happy life for we all , truly deep down , deserve it . 
-One voice has the power to influence not just one but many . And one voice inspired me that I shouldn't regret anything that I do within this life for in the end it makes me who I am . 
-\No one ever finds life worth living ... one has to make it worth living . \"" 
-Each of us has a story to tell . Each one unique . and each one has the potential to influence the world around . 
-True happiness isn't in the multitude of friendships but the worth and choice of them . 
-We are all the products of our thoughts . What we think is what we become . 
-To achieve great things one must not only act , but also dream ; not only plan , but also believe . 
-In this world there is hate , pain , and distrust that much is true ... But it is also true that it can be changed with hope , sympathy , and the ability to dream . 
-I hardly find myself ending up where I wanted to go , but I always seem to find myself ending up where I'm needed the most . 
-Memory is a way to hold on to things you love , the things you are , and the things you never wish to lose . 
... Hmmm where I seem to go chaos follows ... the good kind where friends act ... interesting ... 
-I feel I should not regret any event that has happened to me , for those events had a role in creating the character I am . 
-With each passing day I get a better understanding of myself . And what I see is a person that is fairly arrogant and sarcastic ; but also sympathetic and somewhat generous 
-There is a line that separates the possible and the impossible . But its really lies in a person's determination . 
-Whenever I gain something I will lose something else in return , same with any opportunity , I take one and lost another . 
Where to go from here ... 
-Believe in all things possible .. 
-One day it will all just ... disappear .. 
-It's the moment of truth and the moment to lie , From the right and from the left , This is a brave new world from the last to the first . 
-Holding on to anger and sadness bring nothing but more pain and sorrow . But when they are used correctly they can show you what you < PROPFEMALE > the most , and provide a happier moment when the emotions settle . 
-Wisdom is nothing more than healed pain .. So I'm wondering how wise people believe I am . 
-I have two options ; one I can lie to you and say \I'm fine\ " and it works 75% of the time but it seems you know me enough to know I'm lying . So I'm stuck with two by I tell you exactly what's going on . " 
-Depending on who you are , it can be easy to see life's beauty and the simple pleasures in the midst of chaos around . 
-The most important things in life aren't really things .. 
-Always\ 
remember to slow down in life ; live , breathe , and learn ; take a look \ 
around you whenever you have time and never forget everything and every \ 
person that has the least place within your heart . 
-Life will always knock us down ... But we can choose to get back up 
-Everyday we have a choice , the attitude that we set for the day will impact everything . Though we cannot change the past we can learn from it to change the future 
-It is the job of the magician not to trick a person but to create a moment of wonder .. 
-I feel this is going to be a good day to stay invisible 
-Silence and kind words are the best ways to extinguish insults 
The night I'm having tonight haha . Glad to have friends to cheer me up 
-One of the greatest treasures of this is not found by the eye but the heart 
-It's our dreams that create the world . And through that it may become what we call reality . 
-Life is too short to live it angry and hateful . It is too short to do everything for everyone . But not short enough to make an impact on another person's life . 
-I will never forget ... I will never regret ... I will live my life . I've made my promise today and intend to no ends break it .. 
-Anyone can follow the world as it plunges into chaos , but it takes true strength and insight to see the beauty within the world and find inner peace . 
-One choice , one moment , one person can change everything . 
-The only things that you regret are the things that you didn't do . 
-The challenges in life isn't to block us but to help discover who we are in the world . 
-To hope isn't the conclusion that something will turn out well but a certainty that something will make sense regardless how it turns out . 
-We fall so we can learn to pick ourself up . 
-Give it time and things will fall where they are needed . 
-I can bring a thought to your mind , a tear to your eye or a smile to your face , the catch is I can't be seen because I'm nothing more than a memory 
-It's easy to miss something when your not looking for it . 
-I will never forget , I will never regret , I will live my life and keep all the promises I make . 
-Life certainly has those opportunities to make one realize what you have and < PROPFEMALE > . What that person is made of and what they are passionate for . 
-There is no sense in wasting time . What we are given isn't long enough to spend on useless matters 
-You can't always get what you want , but if you try sometimes you get what you need . 
-If you try , you may fail . If you don't try then you're guaranteed to fail . 
-Rest easy , your faith and belief will prevail . I will stand watch and protect . If I fall I will rise once more . 
-I was always looking outside myself for strength and confidence but it comes from within . It is there all the time . 
-To do something , however small , to make others happier and better , is the highest ambition , the most elevating hope , which can inspire a human being . 
-Kind words are nice and only effective if the person receiving them believes to be true . Other than that they are a waste . Can't help those that don't want to be helped . 
-I believe I'm here for others , not for myself . Everything I've gained is through understanding regardless who the person is and what the difference is . 
-I've learned that helplessness is a \give up\ " reaction . The quitting response is believing that what you do doesn't matter . " 
-Life lives and dies , Life laugh and cries , Life gives up and tries . But life is seen differently through everyone's eyes .. 
-I'd rather be concerned with my character than my reputation , because my character is what I really am , while my reputation is merely what others think of me . 
-To have people believe you're an idiot than to open your mouth to prove . 
-It's no easy task . We all must learn to stand on our own for no one else can do it for us . Sure they can assist but overall it is something we do alone . 
-Where ever the pieces fall I must let them be , for they landed there for a reason . 
-We\ 
tend to forget that happiness doesn't come as a result of getting \ 
something we don't have , but rather of recognizing and appreciating what\ 
we do have 
-Life is not easy for any us . We must believe that we are gifted for something , and that this thing , at whatever cost , must be attained . 
-Seen a < PROPMALE > man beg , a good man sin , a tough man cry , a loser win , a sad man grin and even heard a honest man lie . I've seen the good side of bad and down side of up and everything else in between . 
-Maybe all one can hope for is the right regrets . 
-The value of life is the combination of how you view the world and the impact people believe you have made . 
-Why regret past events for they make us who we are today . 
-Although we believe we may stand alone in the world there are people around us that feel the same thing . 
-We fear what we don't know , hesitant in taking chances , and regretful of mistakes . We do this because it's what makes us human . 
-Now I've realized one of two things that has happened . One , Through the positive views of the world there was a layer of sorrow to create the feeling of appreciation . Two . I shouldn't complain for the life I have . It could have been worse if I have stopped hoping for a bright future .. 
ok not a profound thought but finding chocolate cake in the fridge is amazing and makes me happy . yay chocolate cake nom nom nom 
-How we view the world is a confession of our character . 
-People must be free to do what they believe . It is not our right to punish them\ 
for thinking what they do , no matter how much we disagree 
-Teach them from right and wrong . It must be knowledge that frees us not confines 
-We all have the ability to choose what we want to do and do it well , \ 
to love what we want in life and love it honestly , to control our own \ 
lives for no one else can control it for us . And to have power to make \ 
it a happy life for we all , truly deep down , deserve it . 
-People have all the hopes , aspirations , desires , and flaws of others . 
-Walk in to any situation with an open mind and you will learn . 
-It is that inner judgement that keeps us from doing what we want to do . It is only in rare opportunities we think well of ourselves and only often that people convince us we are not as bad as we believe we are . 
-Motivate yourself by living the advice you preach to others . No one likes to live in a lie ; so be honest with yourself and you'll find that you'll be in a better place 
-The world doesn't stop moving just because you close your eyes . 
-Oh how far I have fallen 
-As long as I try then I can't complain 
-Somethings the moments of making a choice , regardless how small , will change everything . 
-When we fall we have friends that got our backs and help us back up ; sometimes we can't go in it alone . 
-A smile is the best way to get out of any situation , even if its a fake one . It's quite good in fooling others 
Dear < PROPFEMALE > Bushman and < PROPFEMALE > Alpert Thank you for the futon and shadow theater that was fun . 
-Great friends are hard to come by , difficult to leave and impossible to forget 
Not going to lie . This is either really easy or I'm just smart :P . No arrogance intended 
-What we fear is uncertainty and the unknown . Sometime when we know the truth we regret it and there are other times that we wish we knew but never asked the question . 
-Honesty , You may not agree with them but at least you know where they stand 
-Anything that's worth believing in must survive doubt 
-The difference between failure and success isn't in the ability to succeed but the motivation to take act . 
-Each day is a trial to test us and teach us . 
-When standing alone one can accomplish much . When standing together we can accomplish anything . 
-Small impacts change the world 
-If you walk out of a bad situation and in to a good one then it was met to be . 
-Why ask for a lighter burden when you can have stronger shoulders 
-My eyes are renewed , my mind is refreshed , my heart is open , and my perception is brighter rather than consumed in darkness . 
-There is a dormant light in us . The thing that keeps us from falling too far into darkness 
-We may not remember the days but we will remember the moments . 
-The things that are most precious to us are only saved by sacrifice . Thank you . 
\Each of us has a story to tell . Each one unique and each one has the potential to influence the world around . \"" 
Nulla è vero e tutto è concesso . Chiudete gli occhi e fare < PROPFEMALE > salto di fede ... 
-Be careful of action , though it may only last a moment it can create a memory that last forever . 
Psychology : The study of what we already know ... just in fancy words haha . 
-You can do much on your own but when united you can achieve much more 
-Think how happy you are when you have lost everything and then got it back again . 
-\Life will knock us down but we can choose to get back up \"" 
Up at sun rise once more . I feel like its going to be a good day . 
-Impacted by so many . One day I'll return that favor 
-It is a good life we lead . May it never change . And never change us 
-We cannot choose what fate has gave us , but we can certainly use what we have as how we see fit . 
-You never know what you have until it's gone . 
This ordeal is interesting to say the least . Good to know I'm returning to how things once was . 
-The world is a better place , but my job's not done yet obviously .. 
The cooling air flows , the sunrise slowly shows itself , and the stars start to fade . 
-What I do is meaningless , but it is important that I do it . 
-Life's never fair . Things happen for a reason , but being fair has nothing to do with who you are , who you care for and what you stand for . 
-The person you once knew is gone ; constantly changing from the day we are born to the day we depart . 
I would like to say I've been through worse but I can't for the moment . I am still standing strong because if I stay down , I won't be able finish the legacy I started ... 
I anticipated that I would be hurting this morning , but damn I feel pretty good . Given my leg is still sore but no pain no gain right 
Look at each day being new , I'm covered in rain but it feels like the sun is shining . I may fall but I will get back up , Promise . 
Willing to give everyone a second < PROPMALE > and it looks like someone else just gave me mine . 
Like a Phoenix , I am reborn and seeing the world in a different light . Bright than it ever was . Stronger in mind , body , and spirit . To the world I may be one person , but sometimes all it takes is one person to become a catalysis in changing the world . 
-Sometimes you put walls up to keep friends at bay . To protect them when you aren't yourself , because you know in your heart you'll betray their trust . Sometimes when you betray them and feel you're not worth it , they welcome you back with open arms . 
If you know how powerful your thoughts and words were , you'd never think a negative thought again ^_^ 
Watching the < PROPMALE > Potter Movies on ABC Family ... I guess I should go and watch Deathly Hollows before there not in theaters . 
\Sometimes we fall and it's hard to get back up . Sometimes we cry on deaf ears and go unheard . Sometimes we try and don't succeed . Sometimes our luck runs out when we need it the most . Sometimes on our darkest day we truly see the light . \"" 
\It is often the bitter ordeals that are cleverly disguised blessings . \"" 
\Live it as you see fit . You may not get that second chance \"" 
\Learn all what you want to know . \"" 
\They may not remember who we are or what we said but they may remember how we made them feel . \"" 
This is exactly what I asked of them ... so why do I think it's suppose to play out differently .. 
\It is our memories that sets us apart from one another . That ability allows us to learn not only our from victories but our defeats . \"" 
\7-15-15-4 12-21-3-11\ " is a clue . Good luck ! ^_^ " 
Everything will be alright in the end . 
A friend is someone that : sees your flaws and tell you they are your uniqueness , catch you and place back on your feet and willing to help you without your consent 
This flashback is going to be the death of me . 
-Somethings are best done in silence . 
I'm so psyched for this Christmas party . getting paid 
So I guess I got caught by everyone part of this . Hopefully I just place the thought that at least someone is looking out for others . 
-We struggle to make a difference and we never know for certain who we'll meet along the way . Who , among the world of strangers , will hold us close , touch our hearts , and share each others ' pain . 
They truly underestimate themselves . They are worth more than any currency . They help whenever they can . They are my friends . 
I've always had the answer . The end-game . The 5-move-ahead plans . Now ... it's like I'm starting over . Re-evaluating everything . 
Might as well enjoy what I got now . Odds are things are going to change very quicky soon . 
\If you don't know where your going . Take any road for it will lead you anywhere \"" 
Today was one of those \busy-but-not-really-busy\ " days . I think its the fact everyone is ready for break . " 
\The job of the artist is to make the world believe his lie \"" 
Light shined through the darkness , pain melted away , and lungs breathed in fresh air of the new day . 
\Sometimes you have to remember who you were in order to figure out who you want to be \"" 
It just may be the holiday spirit because I feel blessed , empowered and grateful . To all my friends that has helped me get back on my feet when I couldn't do it alone , and to my family that has shown unconditional concern . Thank you and < PROPFEMALE > Christmas !! 
-Creators of our own < PROPFEMALE > . Our memories give it context , our insight gives it purpose 
I must say interesting to say the least . 
-It starts with an idea , a concept , and then flourishes into something more . A genuine realization . 
This year has had many downs , but the ups surpassed them with no doubt . Most of the resolutions I've made were completed on most days so I consider that a success . 2011 , I see we are going to have an interesting time . 
-Take a < PROPMALE > , make mistakes . That's how we grow . Pain nourishes courage . Sometimes we fail in order to succeed 
Another flashback . In some aspects it was a good one still sucks it happened . 
Me : < PROPFIRST > get me a coke !... While your at it make me a sandwich cause your being a woman ! \ 
( < PROPFIRST > comes back ) You think this is funny !! Here .. ( Hands me a sandwich and a coke ) ... \ 
( Me , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > , and < PROPMALE > die laughing ) I love you guys 
One of the most interesting dream I've had in a while . I'm on the streets of Long Beach performing a new card trick I'm working on and the next moment I'm standing in Barcelona 
-Dream with open eyes and look back with your eyes closed . 
-If we don't get it right the first time , we have tomorrow to try again . 
\Even the smallest individual can make an impact \"" 
-Truly great friends are hard to find , difficult to leave , and impossible to forget . 
Be miserable or motivate yourself . Whatever you have to do , it's your choice . 
Never really thought I'd lose this much . What remains is what I need to hold on to .. 
\Being happy doesn't mean that everything is perfect . It simply means that you've looked beyond the imperfections \"" 
\Being happy or sad takes the same amount of energy . It's all in the state of mind . \"" 
\Hold tight to those dreams . For without them it would be like a flying with a broken wing unable to get anywhere . \"" 
Is it odd that I want to know how to do escapology and disappearance acts ?.. :D 
Not yet at 100% but I'll get there soon . 
\One day your life will flash before your eyes . Make sure its worth watching\ " I smile and reply \ " Of course but don't considering me gone yet ;) \"" 
\You know ' Magician ' is a fancy term for Con-man right ;) \"" 
Laughter may not solve the problems but they sure as will help cope with them . 
Sometimes its better to set an example and live by your principles 
-I truly appreciate the little things that got me this far . It's only because I never thought I'd be where I am 
Oh you know its a good day when you have no classes today . 
-Life moves pretty fast . If you don't stop and look around you just might miss .. something ... 
I'm thinking Djokovic is going to walk away with this . Another good question who's going to face him . < PROPMALE > or Ferrer ? 
\Fate has a way of putting in front of us that what strive to leave behind \""

\Often times the things we try to hide are the most obvious to the people around us . \"" 
\We need to talk about your magic ... \ " By < PROPMALE > Quant . Such fun times at the TMS Lounge " 
What a relaxing weekend ; owning in TF2 and L4D2 , watching Djokovic win AUS Open , < PROPFIRST > White taking gold on the superpipe and ending the night with a few cranes and redoing my Black Tiger-Shadow Master card mural 
Well with this snow coming I might as well work on a few idea buzzing in my head .... And probably the homework sitting in the corner feeling neglected ... I have plenty of time . 
\Kindness in words creates confidence . Kindness in thinking creates profoundness . Kindness in giving creates love . \"" 
Sometimes its fun to do the impossible . 
\It's a new start . Pick yourself up and don't give up . \"" 
\Your opinion of the world is also a confession of your character \"" 
I'll pick up the fallen pieces . I'll try to place them together but I can't promise that it will be the same . 
Sometimes we're just blind to see what is really going on . Where the truth is nothing more but another lie , and we are stuck in a beautiful yet ugly bliss 
Skyping with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Thorn 
A secret of life is to enjoy being terribly .. terribly .. deceived . 
Iowa City for a check up , seeing a few friends , work on a project . and cooking up some ideas to perform and teach for a cub scout partol . have a kick ass Friday everyone !

Sometimes we have a choice to turn back on the path we are on but other times we go to far that we just got to keep moving forward . I find myself 10 < PROPMALE > too far to turn back now . 
Amazing how a kind gesture makes the day seem brighter than before . 
PrynsesAudrey Urtado is AWESOME ! :D 
Experience is the most brutal of teachers , you will learn .. you will learn . 
Stuck on campus for the night so i believe i'm going to do something interesting besides watching this magic video over and over again . 
What am I doing ? I am definitely doing this wrong and probably walk away for a while cause its not getting better . No not the \give up\ " attitude just another time to re-evaluate .. " 
I don't know what is funnier < PROPFEMALE > Jones counting 1,120 decimal places out of pi or myself dancing to the the < PROPFIRST > like a song .. :D lol

This rework has opened a huge door that I won't be able to close for a while .. Luckily I have plenty of time to figure it out . 
If you limit your choices only to what seems possible or reasonable , you disconnect yourself from what you truly want , and all that is left is compromise . 
I sit here once again with a blank canvas and endless possibilities start to fill my mind . 
An amazing thing that great people possess is the ability to make other people feel great as well . 
What I stumble across , many people oversee , is that regardless of someone's traits , personality , habits , or whatever how we approach it or go about it showcases our true nature . Maybe not all at once but enough to show the world who we are . 
Ahh ! Why am I so bloody nervous about this performance ? Seriously my palms are sweating and hands shaking and restless legs ! The dinner isn't until 5 tonight .. Hopefully by the time I start my walk-around magic I'll be fine 
Dinner was a hit ! I'm going to make these next two day awesome before my break 
I'm half tempted to walk out in the thunder storm and lay in the rain 
Alright in my International Jam Session with The Magic Session's < PROPFIRST > Daws 
There is an admirable potential that lines in every one of us . Use our strengths , recognize our weaknesses , believe in your ability , and cast away your doubts .

Hanging out with < PROPFIRST > DePenning and < PROPFEMALE > Galvin :D , Did a P90x workout ... I'm going to feel this in the morning 
-I ask myself do I really know half my friends .. Do I even know myself ? 
I'm going for a walk , clear the clouded mind with some air . 
I'll leave it where it lies , It's not in my control and everything will fall where it needs to . 
Leave where I lie and I'll pick myself up , I'll keep walking and move forward 
I got one job to do here and I can't mess this up with personal matters 
\Keep your eyes on that mountain top . One step at a time and don't ever ever stop \"" 
Somewhere along theses lines I do have the strength to keep climbing even if I'm holding on to a thread . 
-We are vulnerable when we trust someone , but on the other side , if we can't trust , neither can we find happiness . 
-I will burden others suffering so they can find happiness . That is my job . I won't act out of self interest and personal gain . 
-I will always have my shadow of doubt but when I realize and look up , the light casting over me is overwhelming that my shadow is just a small shade that just keeps me realistic . 
Shed all the pain I've been holding on , keeping calm and move along . I got this because I always do ^_^ 
-No matter how pressing my problems seem to be , the moment that I have someone else to take care for , mine seem less significant

The sunrise was brighter than I have noticed before . I guess it means my job is almost through 
Time to get some filming done and put some final touches to a project 
You know I'm feeling kickass right now . Pretty sure Aced my psych test , got some filming done , < PROPMALE > out with all my great friends , and I believe life is great , no complaints 
What did I find when I was filming today ? Turtles ! Walking along the grass like they own the place haha . 
There's real magic in enthusiasm . It defines the difference between mediocrity and accomplishment . 
-If you're alone , I'll be your shadow . If you want to cry , I'll be your shoulder . If you want a hug , I'll be your pillow . If you want to be happy , I'll be your smile . But anytime you need a friend . I'll just be me .. 
\Life is a mirror and will reflect back to the thinker what he thinks into it . \"" 
-Experience is the only teacher that will give you a test first and then give you the lesson . 
I'm going to make this work even if it kills me . Everyone needs a < PROPMALE > to shine . 
I really haven't been around . what kind of person am I for just making stupid excuses in avoiding to see you guys .. will you even recognize me ? 
Rest easy my friends , we survived another day . Let's show the world what we are truly capable of doing 
I can't sit around anymore and wait to see things change I need to become part of it 
What can you do when you know you can't help and just watch on the sidelines .. 
Sometimes you just need to let the rain fall to see the rainbow . 
-The only things you regret are the things you don't do . 
\You can do anything in this world if you are prepared to take the consequences . \"" 
Just got to cut the losses and look for another opportunity . 
For everything you have missed , you have gained something else , and for everything you gain , you lose something else .  
Our attitude toward life determines life's attitude towards us .  
I would like to say \I am around when needed\ " but sometimes that won't be the case so \ " I'll be around as long as I can \"" 
\George what would be one magic trick you want to be remembered for .. \ " \ 
-Work is never done for those that dream . 
-Sometimes all it takes is one person with passion to make a difference . 
Life is pretty good , sure there are some rainy days but you can certainly make the best of it ^_^ 
That dream happened again .. : I stand center stage in front of a mass number of people . I don't know if I was performing , speaking , or what but I had that feeling I'm impacting them someway somehow . Significant ? or just another dream .. 
Truly great friends are hard to find , difficult to leave , and impossible to forget .  
-Ready ? Let's change the world ! 
Inspiration comes from anywhere and because of the recent events and future ones I feel amazing :) . 
\Sometimes your joy is the source of your smile but sometimes your smile can be the source of your joy\ " ^_^ my friends are awesome " 
Let the good times keep rolling . 
Sometimes feeling this good doesn't need a reason . Let it flow and enjoy it . 
\You were made to fill a purpose that only you could do \"" 
< PROPMALE > Christiansen : You're entering end of discussion . \ 
Me : Damnit ... I know I will but you are not helping my procastination !! 
What better way to spend the day , Doing some homework in the Studio with Pandora on , and a contest in the near future to win an Ipad . What's my best effect to perform for this ... 
Almost 9 years damn where did that time go .. 
\A positive attitude may not always solve the problem but it will definitely keep things in perspective \"" 
My phone is currently offline with services so if you need to get a hold of me I guess try and message me here . Have a great day everyone !! 
May you have enough happiness to make you sweet , enough trials to make you strong , enough sorrow to keep you human enough hope to make you happy . 

\Humor is our way of defending ourselves from life's absurdities by thinking absurdly about them . \"" 
\Let's go on an adventure ... google maps have me the wrong directions \"" 
Lmao this is funny as hell . different variety of people talking about religion , insults , and performing some magic . man these people are great rofl 
I'm feeling such great energy from today . Hiked , Beach , Worked out , Learned some boxing techniques , Tacos , Wing night , and amazing people . I just wish I can share some of this with you guys back home ! 
I tip my hat and bow to you , I'm grateful for everything that is done .. 
sand and ocean on my feet is a relaxing feeling 
Damn .. maybe I am crazy ... oh well touch your toes in the bold . 
Wow these people are really impatient and being really bitchy .. weather is out of human control so calm the hell down .. and shut the f *** up ! 
I have this feeling something is about to happen to change my personality . I'm not too sure if I should be concerned or excited . I'll settle for anxious to see what happens next . ^_^ 
I got to go to an actual magic shop and it was amazing . I could < PROPFEMALE > out there all day long ! Got a book .. and a special surprise for many of you that haven't see since the start of this school year ^_^ 
Standing so high up enjoying the view to realize when I look down I see my friends still climbing . I'm glad I always being extra rope to help them up 
So I thought making pancakes for breakfast would be a good idea .... No it wasn't , I couldn't find everything I needed so I'm settling for a bagel and milk . Hmm maybe I should learn how to cook lmao ! 
Damn I'm feeling excellent . I'm going to ride on this good energy all the way through graduation . 
I didn't realize how far I've came until I took that moment to look around and admired the view . 
I'll have to relax and see what happens in about 24 hours should return to normal ... hopefully 
I can probably go to California later this month !!!! man that would be a great start to the summer !! 
Taking each day , and rolling with the punches 
-It's a lie to think you're not good enough ! It's a lie to think you're not worthy of anything . Because the truth is .. YOU are good enough , worthy enough . 
I always seem to find a way . No worries with the future when I got the present to focus on . Got to live in the moment ., right ? :D

almost there ! just need to survive 2 more hours of stupidity . 
I can just sleep all night and just be casted away in the dreams ^_^ 
I kept holding on to things that weren't there , and now that I let go of the things that weighed me down for so long I feel more nimble and stronger . 
Just finished cleaning all the clutter in the dorm room , eh . Thank you Pandora for making it fun with songs to sing and dance to hahah ! 
I'm starting to feel that fire of greatness sparking . I can't be knocked down .
