< PROPFIRST > Hicks has just joined the cast of Grease at the National Theater in DC ... wonder if it will be a sell-out ??? 

To each of you who wished me a Happy Birthday .... your rebate check is in the mail ! Honestly , I am really touched and thank you for making my day ! xoxo 
How come when I was 47 there was an ad for a free iPad ... and now that I turn 48 the ad says it's for age 48 only ? Hmmm , something must be up with that ...

What's your favorite color ? What's your favorite country ? GLEE was awesome tonight ! Brings back fun memories of rice , newspaper and toast ... 
Thank you everyone for all the birthday wishes- my candles were definitely blown away . Last year i spent my birthday trapped inside ( alone ) because of 2 feet of snow in DC . This year was amazing and i got to share it with some good friends and people I love ! And I avoided snow ! Best Birthday Evah !
