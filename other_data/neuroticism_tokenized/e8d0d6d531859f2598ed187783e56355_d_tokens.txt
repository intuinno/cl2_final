Happy New Year 2010 !!!!! Here's to an awesome , fresh year full of happiness !!! :) 

Happy Saturday , everyone ...... :) Get to spend one last vacation day with my boy before he goes back to school and we return to the dreary routine ... :P :'(

is going to go give blood this afternoon ... Wish me luck ! :) 
just returned from donating blood ... it went really well ! It was awesome ! I almost passed out , though not entirely , so it's not as cool as it COULD have been ... :)

And hello again ... welcome to a new week of awesome weirdness ... at least in my mind ... Then again , one wonders if my mind is ever NOT random or weird ... Sorry , can you tell I am pretty tired right now ? I can ... O_o 
wonders where this path is leading her ... 
wishes she had super-speedy running/flying skills so she could go where she wanted to go ... O_o ... or perhaps a newer car ... 
wonders \wherefore\ " for no particular reason except that it sounds really cool ... "

November is Adoption Awareness Month . Nearly 40 percent of American adults , or 81.5 million people , have considered adopting a child , according to the National Adoption Attitudes Survey . If just one in 500 of these adults adopted , every waiting child in < PROPMALE > care would have a permanent family .

My parents were MEAN to me when I was a kid . They made me do chores & go to school . They gave me a curfew , suggested I get a job & work for the things that I wanted . They insisted that I do my best at school , at my job & to take pride in my appearance & my work . I grew up with morals , a good work ethic , respect for the law , and my elders . I thank God everyday for my MEAN parents . Copy and paste if you agree ! ;) <3 
A cancer patient only has one wish , to kick cancer's ass . I know that 97% of you won't re-post this as your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do . In honor of someone who died , had cancer or is fighting cancer post this for at least one hour

believe in Jesus Christ and have accepted Him as my personal Savior . One person on FB has challenged all believers to put this on their wall ... In the Bible it says , if you deny Me in front of your peers , I will deny you before my Father at The Gates of Heaven . ( Mat 10:33 ) This is simple ... If you love God and you are not afraid to show it , re-post this .. ... no shame here .. :)

Tell me if this makes any sense . I'm still scratching my head at this one . Homeless go without eating . Elderly go without needed medicines . Mentally ill go without treatment . Troops go without proper equipment . Veterans go without benefits they were promised . Yet we donate billions to other countries before helping our own first . Have the guts to re-post this . 1% will re-post and 99% won't!!! 
Whazzaaaaaaa ...!!!!!! :P I'm sleepy ... :(
