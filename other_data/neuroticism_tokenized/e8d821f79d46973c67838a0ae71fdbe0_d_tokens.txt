DOES ANY ONE WANT OR KNOW SOMEONE WHO MIGHT WANT A KITTEN ?? < PROPFIRST > and I found one last night in a WalMart parking lot and we cannot keep it . I will be driving NORTH from FL to NY at the end of this month and will be driving from FL to CO in December . I am willing to bring the < PROPFEMALE > to you !!! Let me know ...

is counting down the minutes for < PROPFIRST > to get home from training ...

is bored and missing < PROPFIRST > - thank God I'm not going to be in Florida all by myself until July ! 
is staying up to see if being 27 feels any different than being 26 ... 
has determined that 27 feels like it's almost 30 - depressing as I haven't accomplished much of anything ...

is missing < PROPFIRST > already - how sappy am I ?

CONGRATULATIONS TO < PROPMALE > AND < PROPFEMALE > SCHINNER !!

is looking forward to a relaxed evening at home with her husband and friends 
is at the < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > concert with her hubby and friends - totally awesome 
is trying to figure out why anyone would want to take the supplement ' Ball Refill ' - the extreme semen volumizer ... I'm a little traumatized by this 
is pondering life's great mysteries ... Like why are men incapable of putting dirty clothes in the hamper - its not like its hidden away in a cave somewhere ... 
Thinks weekends at home with < PROPFIRST > are the best :) 
is having fun with the newest member of our family :) - ' Drifa ' 
can't figure out why she's conscious at this hour ...

is freaking out because we can FINALLY get a home < PROPFEMALE > ! YAY ! 
Just found out < PROPFIRST > ordered ' Ball Refill ' - FML 
has decided that home ownership is highly overrated ... 
can't believe her husband has a job that requires body armor ... sometimes I forget that he could come down with a serious case of Death working his job ... it just seems like blowing shit up is too much FUN to be that dangerous ! 
can't wait to go look at houses today ! 
is getting ready to go to the Realtor's office to put an offer in on a house - wish us luck , people ! 
THEY ACCEPTED OUR OFFER !! WAAAHOOOO ! 
is up making two cheesy casseroles and two dozen cookies for < PROPFIRST>'s team tomorrow ... I feel as if this is preparing me for school bake sales and pot lucks ... 
Home inspection went great ! < PROPFEMALE > amount locked in ! Apparently we're inheriting 20 some chickens ... anyone want fresh eggs ? 
After answering a million questions online and attaching ( and sending ) my cover letter , resume and online test score to a job I actually would like and would do very well at , I found out I don't qualify for the position because I do not lead ' a healthy vegan lifestyle ' FML 
is trying to find a ' happy place ' 
is beyond frustrated 
thinks September should hurry up and get here already >.< 
would like her headache to go away now ... 
so very , very angry right now ... 
Just 19 more days !!!! 
the countdown continues ... :) 
is watching the kitten have a mini freak out ... me thinks that the < PROPFEMALE > crack was a baaad purchase ... 
is preparing for hurricane < PROPMALE > . You may ask , ' How does one prepare for such a thing ? ' Well it's simple ;\ 
\ 
1)Go to the store to buy essentials ( two loaves of bread , a jar of peanut butter , a case of beer , four gallons of water and two packs of cigarettes ) \ 
2 ) Sit back and watch the idiots out there scramble around like it's the end of the world\ 
Get a grip folks - I promise you Armageddon is NOT upon us 
Some hurricane ... lol ... Let's all hear it for a light persistent drizzle !! 
14 days !! 
Ren Fair was AWESOME ! 
Eight long days and counting ... 
I think I'm going to go insane ... 
Whew ! Mom's dog , < PROPFEMALE > , gave us a bad scare today ... after emergency surgery , the vet found a mass the size of a cantaloupe ( why are masses and tumors always reduced to fruit ?? ) on her spleen . Spleen was removed - hopefully the mass was benign . LOVE YOU < PROPFEMALE > - < PROPFEMALE > in there mom ;) 
Out spending < PROPFIRST>'s bonus :) 
Welcome to the world < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > !! Congratulations to < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE > :)

is wandering aimlessly around the apartment - missing < PROPFIRST > , anxious for mom&sis&pups to get here , nervous and excited about the house ... and finally ... having no clue where to even START packing this apartment up ... 
FML - that is all 
is so happy that her mom , sister and the ' kids ' made it safely across the country :) Mom , < PROPFEMALE > - you guys rock !! 
WHHHAAAA - HOOOOOO !!!!!!!! We've got the house :)

is feeling like I should be building an ark ... 
is bummed mom is leaving tomorrow :( Now who's going to help me stay sane and unpack ? 
is having a little mini freak out ... please everyone keep their fingers crossed that this < PROPFEMALE > goes through ... 
is hoping that dinner doesn't take four hours to prep and cook tonight :) 
The stress is killing me ... life is so up in the air right now . It doesn't help that < PROPFIRST > left this evening for a week at sea , either ... though knowing he is going to have the time of his life hanging out with his team mates and diving helps a bit ... 
Europe in T-minus 72 hours and counting :D 
Sitting at JFK International Airport - Dublin , here we come ! 
Whew - spent a fun ( and exhausting ) first day in Dublin ! Got all squared away with the ' responsible stuff ' ( getting a cell phone , getting bus tickets , studying maps etc ) and then enjoyed the sights of Dublin via the Dublin Tour bus . Had fun at the Guinness warehouse - and found out that the Euro is going to punch a HUGE hole in my bank account ... * wince * how do you EU guys afford to live ?!? 
Yay ! Made it to London safe and sound - though the trip to the hotel was over two hours long and not at all fun >:( Saw the Tower of London today , bought all of our travel needs ( bus tickets , subway , passes for the Tower and the Dungeon ) and had dinner at a great little pub . HAPPY BIRTHDAY < PROPFEMALE > ! and Hail Brittania ... 
Sitting in the London City Airport waiting for our flight to < PROPFIRST > - the non English speaking half of our trip begins ... so exciting ! Also a little daunting because the only French I can remember is the alphabet and < PROPFIRST > 1 through 5 ... 
Getting ready to go to sleep at the last destination of our whirlwind EuroTrip - ROME - just finished purchasing our tickets for Vatican City and the Sistine Chapel ;) Then it's back to the states ( Friday ) for the International Travel Superstars , Mighty Mouse and Birdy :D 
Really mixed emotions right now - had a great trip , glad to be back in the States but still miss my wookie dearly :( Also had some really bad news about our house while I was away ... :( 
Home safe and sound ... 
HAPPY HALLOWEEN !! 
So my car just took a shit and died ... What else can go wrong ?

Spending the whole morning deep cleaning your house only to come home to your dog's bloody diarrhea all over the creme colored carpet : Priceless 
Soooo , < PROPFEMALE > had explosive diarrhea all over the house and in the car on Thursday , then she had a seizure on Saturday night , then she had to be on IV fluids all day yesterday . On Sunday , my dad broke his led four wheeling with my husband and had to have a < PROPMALE > an screws put in his leg that same night . Currently , I am sitting in the ER waiting to be seen because I threw up blood all morning . What a fucking week ... 
Sitting in the < PROPFEMALE > , NC airport ... Waiting for my connecting flight to Gulfport , MS . Why am I going to Gulfport ( you might ask) ? To pick up < PROPFIRST>'s truck . Yeah .

Holy crap the puppy is driving me crazy ... could someone please tell me why I thought it was a good idea to rescue this mutt ?!? 
I am desperately trying to find the motivation to go grocery shopping ... there is nothing in my fridge save for condiments ... 
Just mowed the front ' yard ' - can't get the f@ ! * #ng leaf blower to start so I guess the driveway is going to have to be messy for another week 
Woot ! Gonna be in CO in two weeks ! 
Hooray for sushi ! 
This sucks ... sucks even more that we have over five months to go ... 
Ugh ... I see a lot of yard work in my near future ... 
Have I mentioned I love my bathtub ? 
Nothing like planning to go to bed early , pulling out your washed clothes for the next day and discovering that you somehow managed to cover the entire load in a fine layer of stubborn white fluff ... Yay ... 
Happy st < PROPFIRST>'s day to all ! 
Tonka Truck gets the big snip today :) Pictures in his satellite dish to follow ... 
So I went to the store to pick up a scale today ... I had NO IDEA that there were more options than ' digital ' and ' not digital ' - seriously , does anyone really need a scale that will ' speak ' your weight , BMI , bone density and water weight ?!?
