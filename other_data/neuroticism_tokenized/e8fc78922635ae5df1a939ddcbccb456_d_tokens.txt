Ah long long day , another one tommorow . 
2 hour layovers suck . But the 5 hour one coming up just sounds like a freaking blast . 
My prayers go to all the family and friends . 
Zach Hougans birthday is today . Everyone go bug him . 
It's zach hougans birthday so go message him and what not . Don't forget to call him or text him at 360-904-5234 and leave tons of voicemails so he feels loved or something . I guess he's depressed because he's not doing something as cool as last year . :( 
Bored . :/ I actually finished my homework : D 
only one notification all day :p sad 
Who has hotka's sixties ? When is that slang story due ? 
I just googled something about green eyes and found that it's a rare color . Now I feel special . Thank you facebook quiz .

Can anyone give me the homework for 4th period Paape's class 5th period black , and 6th period faulk for today and yesterday ? 
There actually is no school tomorrow because of the sickness . But for those who missed the school announcement you need to call in sick if you don't want to attend school . 
haha more tears of inspiration . Today it's from Mr. Holland's opus 
And right as I post how I got tears of inspiration the movie got so sad :( 
And it's getting sadder ... 
Ok . So a kid whos the son of a dad who loves music , and who loves music himself , goes deaf , then the mom cant talk to the kid , the dad who taught a hard working black man to play drums is happy for a sec , then three years later the black man who played drums gets killed in < PROPFEMALE > . This is a SAD movie 
but the movie got better :) 
Someone should text me . 360.980.0970 
only a band nerd would have cried to that . 
I <3 pirate 
Call me gay , but I just had an awesome bath with lavender bath salts , and sherbert ice cream afterwards . Now If i could just find that handout for Ms. Faulks so I know what to write about 
I don't want to sound cocky or anything , but I RIP at writing three < PROPFEMALE > papers in 20 minutes . 
Bleh . Doing nothing tonight . 
slept horrible 
Off to church : ) 
Firefox > Safari > Internet Explorer <3 my cuddly fox . 
Lawl at having like 2 hours of homework but making Facebook my top priority tonight . Ah addiction :) 
Off to bed . Another night of not doing my homework . Woo facebook . At least it's not World of Warcraft or something 
New Photo , i'm a picture whore . Go comment . 
World of Warcraft .... o.O Whoa . 
About to go get lost in WoW . Pray that I get sleep tonight . 
nice day at the mountain 
30 notifications . o.o Anywho , awesome day at the mountain :))) 
It's so much harder to pirate photoshop on a < PROPMALE > than on windows 
Has just realized i've edited like every one of my FB defaults , and they all turn out kinda .... generic artsy . 
Zach : God , i'm probably the worst procrastinator ever . Josh : Yeah , but dude . Zach : But what ? Josh : Titties are amazing . Zach : What ? Are you watching porn or something ? Josh : No . I'm just stating that titties are in fact , amazing . 
does anybody have parents or friends who have a connection to help me get a job ? It'd be an awesome help . 
It's either WoW , or do my genetics homework . Oh my . This is seriously a life changing dilema .... 
Life is win . Two doors of snowbnoarding , in a row . 
The ignorance of certain people is outstanding . 
Getting a droid 
\WAIT DO YOU LIKE BREASTS ????? \"" 
I love the droid . Can't wait til I actually get it ^ . - 
Sorry guys . I'm not gay . My dog was on my computer :/ 
I'm Gabbi and I create groups that get like 1,000 members in 2 weeks . 
testing something 
Morninng . 
Good Night . Got to < PROPFEMALE > with the Girl 
Amazing day at the mountain 
Snow+Girlfriend+yeah = : ) 
What a lovely day . :] 
11:11 1-1-11\ 
\ 
This is going to one epic night . 
Has anyone ever twitched some odd muscle and tried to make it move again ( because it was really cool ) , but then come to the realization that your body just did the impossible and you can't reenact it ? 
And now i'm home : ) And hanging with my favorite person tomorrow <3 
Awesome night , with my Girlfirend . Because I dont like men . < PROPFEMALE > . 
Editing 10 minutes of < PROPFIRST > and I jumping around , lighting my socks on fire , and people who ask if we're done dancing every minute is turning out to be a blast . :O 
Hey ! 20 slide powerpoints are fun ! Due on friday , but i'll be starting tommorow . because i have no motivation tonight . 
I hate when you fall on your tailbone , and then , it hurts for a year afterwards . And nobody gets why it hurts you to sit down . 
< PROPMALE > was good :) And the movie premier was great . Minus the part , where this person like , came in late . Even though she organized it . 
The fact that I'm even using Drama in a status update makes me mad . It's the dumbest thing ever . 
2 < PROPFEMALE > freewrite and 7 chapters , due tommorow . Here I go . 
Hey . Let's go ask < PROPMALE > to post 20 million things on craigslist , and then blame him if they dont get 1000000 hits each . After all , it's on a computer . He's a kid , he likes computers , he must like doing my work for me . 
The day after 2 days before monday , and 5 days before Friday , shall be an amazing day . 
Had such an amazing day . And going to have a beautiful weekend , with my favorite lady a long for the ride <3 
Tommorow . Tommorow !!! 
I happened to have an amazing day . Even if my car's back window got smashed in . 
My facebook wall just consisted of at least 30 updates of people joining groups or leveling up in mafia wars/farmville/animal whatever , until somebody had actually * written * a status . My my facebook world , we are indeed lazy today . 
Tired . Whoa . 
Zach has an amazing penis 
Wait . He's cockblocking me . 
And I am Home . A very grim place at the moment , wooooo :D 
But really , i had a good day today : ) 
My Name is < PROPFEMALE > Tissot , and I join 800 facebook groups every day so < PROPMALE > can't check his facebook wall . 
Goodnight all : ) 
umm ..... mark twain project due tommorow , barely started . go me . 
Honestly , it's all for the best . 
\What do you want to do ? \ " \ " I kinda wanna watch this movie ... it has big sharks ... \ " \ " Wouldn't it be really legit to be a shark ? \ " Hahaha . Best friend time is the best . " 
What an intense week ... 
However , i DO like the netflix commerical 
My names Zach . I laugh at brutal , and terrible pictures of those who died in the holocaust , mainly because every one looks just like < PROPFEMALE > . 
1/5 pages down for this reasearch . Two nights left to work on it . Should I continue while i'm on a train of thought ? 
That 70's show is the remedy to all disease . 
Does not want to write another three pages tonight .... 
Let's drop all of this emotional baggage . Life is way to short to get focused on one pile of crap . Let's live the present and stop stressing the future , whatever happens is all for the best . Always . :) Epiphany's are grand . 
and life is the coffee . Ignore the cup . 
Bedtime . 
Relief . 
J.J. I see you're online . 
I'm going to start being annoyingly manly and learn how to repair car engines or chop wood or something . Of course , I have to smell like sweat and dead fish . All the girls will be all over me . Brah . 
Even though it's really gay , having < PROPFIRST > Green nudes to whip out of my phone and randomly show people is actually pretty entertaining . Nobody expects such a handsome man to be exposing his love stick on my phone ! 
So . 3 pages left . I really , really need to start those . But bed sounds quite a bit better . Decisions ... 
I cannot focus at all . Lord help me . 
Finished . Except my quotes aren't even proper MLA , and they don't match my work cited < PROPFEMALE > . But i have til may for it to actually be right . I'm tired right now . 
< PROPMALE > removed me from his friends list . Life is very , very sad now . 
guess who like , 25 dollars of starbucks left ? This guy 
Thank you everyone for all of your love and happy birthdays and what not . It really does mean a lot , and I had an awesome day , and birthday . I'd also like to especially thank the sexy man who jumped out of the strawberry for me , and the gals who got him to do it . You guys are amazing . :] 
I really enjoy how the only other language I get to see on my effing facebook wall happens to be the one I hate reading the most , because that just so happens to be the only one ridgefield seems to offer . 
Hey . The next like , 6 days are like a saturday . Alright ! 
Logging off , i'm talking to way to many people at once . Thank you everyone , your love/support/stripping/whatever else means more than you know . <3 
I like how I could totally not talk to anybody all day , and still not have anyone to talk to . But , if anyone's curious . Zach broke his wrist :D 
This shop is cold , but it's kind of comfortable . I don't know if I want to turn the heater on or not ... Life throws some < PROPMALE > decisions ... 
Guess who's doing like nothing for easter . Me 
Our bands playing the < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > parade ! We better see everyone there ! 
I hate when people feel a need to make a comment on EVERYTHING the teacher says . Its even worse when they have to laugh at every joke 
Its weird . My skin literally is sweating grease after eating that pizza . 
Lonnnggg day :) We gave < PROPFEMALE > a fun suprise though : D 
You know my family is bad when my dad sends me porn and challenges me to find something better . This is the third time it's happened . I'm tempted to send him some graphic gay and tranny porn or something . And spam his inbox with it . That'll really give him confidence in his son . 
Gabbi is a heroine of god . I found that interesting . 
ill just do my english notes tommorow . In the morning . Like I always say I will . It's totally going to happen . 
I like when people are in good moods :) it makes my day ! 
Gabbi is driving all by herself now , and she's even at a college class right now ! I'm so proud of her !!! :D 
Voxtrot is so good . 
Darling I'm tired , I should be leaving , leaving . 
I find myself missing a certain someone 
In the middle of freezing town . 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > yyyyy !!! :D 
< PROPFEMALE > and gabbi are two amazing ladies , and its my pleasure to spend this trip with such lovely people ! :D <3 
Heellllloooooooo < PROPFEMALE > hello < PROPFEMALE > hello < PROPFEMALE > hello < PROPFEMALE > , my names hello < PROPFEMALE > , I'm super cute , hello < PROPFEMALE > hello < PROPFEMALE > hello < PROPFEMALE > 
17 minute drum petting solo's are the shit . 
what hell happened to all of my horoscopes ???? 
Phoenix has gorgeous music . 
Everyone in jazz band , we don't have it tommorow . < PROPFEMALE > I'm supposed to let you knoowwww 
I'm really , really , really tired . Scouts doesn't sound fun tonight . 
My mom just made the most effing fantastic chicken in the world . My life is so great . I love you mom . 
I hate having to constantly apologize for things . 
Zach , thank you man . You're an awesome friend whether you know it or not . I don't say it enough . 
I love the hell out of you . Thank you for a smile at the end of the day . You know who you are . 
Congrats to Gabbi , for devoloping her first role of film ! Were all super proud of you !!! Great job ! 
I'm indefiantly grateful to have someone in my life who cares as much as you do . Thank you . <3 
More amazing chicken . Watching NCIS and then Gleeeee ! And then I get to stay up kinda late . Alllrrriiiiggghhtttt ! 
I got a tumblr . Sorry , i'm just figuring it all out right now (: ownfir.tumblr.com 
We have a lovely new addition to our jazz band :D 
Just totally failed a math quiz . 
Dear 94.7 . I really do love you , and you have the best local station , hands down . But in your lovely long music sweeps , could you play more than just the days top 10 ? Hearing the same song 11 times in one day does kinda get boring . With love , < PROPMALE > 
\Stephanie Meyer's \ " Twilight\ " novels have become the fifth most banned or challenged book in the world . This marks the first time a book has ever been banned solely because it sucks \"" 
Can we please stop watching porn guys ? 
I need a new person to text . I've ran out of consistent people :( 
I was searching through google chrome extensions , and there's a pray on time extension . It tells islamic people when to pray , and what direction to pray , at any given time of the day . Now they just need to make a jewish one for < PROPFEMALE > . :D 
Is it really so hard to lift the seat up ? 
Modest mouse . 
Had an awesome night with < PROPFEMALE > and gabbi !!! With a little suprise appearance :) I love spending 4 hours with your friends :))) 
To the people I offended . I didn't realize that little mistake had repercussions . I won't spread around the secret anymore . It's a one time thing , and that little facebook mishap is something I will take into consideration . Especially with the people I share the great gifts of music too . 
Alright ! Another motivational speech ! I love these ! :D 
She always leaves me wondering . 
And this morning , she looks super cute . 
My life is basically content . :) 
I love you through everything , darling . 
< PROPFEMALE > , before we start a two year liking war , let's agree that I win . 
Just got pulled over . :/ 
Its strange how a girl can look absolutely stunning in a day , yet think they look as good as the mold on old bread . 
<333 
I'm so madly in love . 
I love the sound of rain on my window . 
Gabbi , thank you for such a lovable little heart battle . You made the rest of my week . :D I love you ! 
My life is complete 
She leave's me with a distinguishable smile , only brought on due to her , and her alone . And I'll fall asleep with that smile , have great dreams with that smile , and wake up . With that smile . Starting the day off with that same , happy , smile . (: 
About to lose my convertable virginity :) 
Gabbi the rain catcher 
American Apparel is so soft . 
Doing custom whtite T shrits for $10 . If you send me a design to put on the shirt in like , the next 2 hours . I'll bring it on Monday . Probably . 
How did god make somebody as cute as you ? 
Why yes Scamahorn , we do need to hear an explanation of where you are every second of the week . And yep , this week WAS weird . Just like every other week of the school year . :) 
You know what's awkward ? Having your best friend open your browser , and having them see that redtube is your most recent search history . 
Everyone watch out . There's cops taking radar on i5 south near the 205 exit and i5 north right after the salmon creek exit . 
I love repeat trains on my facebook . 
< PROPFEMALE > , I just saw you on this website ... \ 
http://hipsterhunter.com/HIPSTER_HUNTER_HOME.html 
I hope I did the right thing ... 
What a great motivational speech Scamahorn ! :D 
< PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > are going to kill rabits and roast them tonight after the jazz gig . \ 
And they aren't kidding . \ 
I'm very , very , very angry . >:( 
Darling , I love you . 
Had an awesome time camping with my favorite ladyfriend . 
Ladyfriend = My favorite person in the universe . 
I can't wait for 11/11/2011 . Something very special is going to happen . 
Camping with the best person in the world seems to have been much more fun than Prom . Although i'm sure Prom had some cool inside jokes , or something . \ 
Besides , we got to see a really cool waterfall . 
Guess what's done ? \ 
My senior paper . 
I'm having one of those days . 
You're defiantly some kind of gorgeous . (: 
Vegetarian for a week to this date . :) 
< PROPMALE > Burge has a really young mom . \ 
And her 90's pictures made my morning . 
I hate < PROPMALE > . 
The I hate < PROPMALE > facebook group got taken down . \ 
I'm really , really , really upset . 
Just stopped my dad from losing like , at least 10 grand on an internet scam . \ 
When will parents learn ? 
In a way better mood thanks to < PROPFIRST > . \ 
He Basically just stopped like two weeks of think ranting to myself . \ 
So , thank you < PROPFIRST > 
Just had a great boca burger , and I was really suprised to find it tasted better than actual hamburger . 
No jazz tommorow , scamahorn has a meeting . \ 
Except < PROPFEMALE > , he said he needs you to like go pick up some mouthpiece or something that he got from music world . 
Gabbi , do you know how excited I am for the Chosen Ones ? \ 
Holy crap . \ 
This is going to be epic . I can't wait 
Went from 1900 songs to 2700 songs in an hour . \ 
Go me . 
Holy shit . She's just so effing cute ! :D 
Mr. Meek looks like an alien . 
Darling , would you be so inclined to check your text messages ? 
Sitting outside Gabbi's house . She doesn't know it , neither does her family . They're sleeping . \ 
I'd go inside , but they changed the location of their spare key ... 
Sex and nachos . :) 
Gabbi sings in the shower :) how cahuuttteee ! 
But watching her sing in person is a million times better . 
Yesterday was great , and seattle was lovely . \ 
A fun day to add to a good weekend :) Even if someone did fall asleep on the back home :p 
This is really cheesy , but , have you ever just lied awake at night , with that one person on your mind ? My god its on the verge of being euphoric . 
What a wonderful couple of days :) 
Had to put our dog down today ... 
Can't wait for tommorow and this week to be over . I need to get away , and have some time with my bro . 
Recording yourself play trombone makes you realize how bad you really sound . \ 
Whoa . 
Is super proud of Gabbi for having some awesome grades ! 
Oh ! Old navy ! That's where you get nice clothes !!! 
Great day with the bro on the mountain . Gonna get even better soon . :) \ 
Still hope to < PROPFEMALE > with my favorite lady tonight . 
Make\ 
a fist with your left hand , squeeze your left thumb , then put your \ 
right index finger down your throat . NO GAG REFLEX . 
I can't wait until < PROPMALE > classes fall quarter . I'm going to have such a short schedule next year :) 
Gabbi , good luck at Physical Therapy . Love you :] 
Hooked on scouting 
Goodnight all 
I had an awesome day with gabbi at the picnik , and it got even better with zach and < PROPMALE > :) all in all , I'm content 
I'm in a way way better mood since like , 10 minutes ago 
Oh .... god .... Donna eats . 
I don't know what's ahead of me . But for whatever I just did , I think it's honestly for the best . 
A really nice guy just gave me 39 cents that I was short for grocerys . Oddly enough , its these kinds of acts of kindness that really give me faith in our race . 
< PROPFEMALE > is a fantastic person :) more than cool ! 
Dad walks into room , looking around the room frantically . \ 
\Let's seeeeeee\ " \ 
7 11 is now selling farmville sponsored iced coffee . What is this world coming too ? 
\My cousin < PROPMALE > has no problem finding his way to a free meal 
Eff you dad . You defiantly do know how to make everything worse . 
Going to start working on my eagle . Really optimistic about it . \ 
Future plans seem to be working out . Air force reserve , I'll be talking to you guys tomorrow :) 
Every day Dad . You just make every day even better , dont you . \ 
D: 
So , Senior Speech tommorow . Not really prepared , but whatever . She likes me . \ 
Maybe I should go start on this Social Studies . Probably not going to . 
So do not fear , for I am with you ; do \ 
not be dismayed , for I am your God . I will strengthen you and help you ; I\ 
will uphold you with my righteous right hand . \ 
< PROPMALE > 41:10 
< PROPFIRST>'s formspring is like the most entertaining social stalking experience i've had in the past 3 days . 
Speech went really well :) 
94.7 , you seem to be playing all the right music today :) thank you . 
Thought of the day : Compared to the scope of life , any issues I could have right now are absolutely insignificant . In retrospect , life really is good . 
Oh < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . You are wonderful . 
My horoscope looks incredibally positive todaayyy :D 
Well alright , its okay , we all feel ashamed sometimes everyday . I just keep it to myself in the sun , in the sun . 
Phone just got taken away . Dont text me . 
Id like to thank my fantastic sister for saving my family life right about now :) \ 
It mean a lot sissss ! \ 
(: 
A fight breaking out over a bench is just a little crazy . 
Oh Zoey , you are so gifted . You must have the voice of a literal angel . \ 
You're my inspiration today , Ms. Deschanel . 
One month of vegetarianism . :) 
I never liked Mr. Brightside until today hahaha 
Kinda bummed ... I actually like loveline . 94:7 got rid of it :( \ 
Everything else is cool though . Can't wait for 94.7 two . 
My names < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > , I wear blue tooths to the middle of school . 
Like this status \ 
and I'll post on your Wall something I like about you . Re-post as your \ 
status if you're up to the challenge . ( : 
To those senior who know I'll miss them . \ 
Congrats . 
I'm convinced I have the cutest < PROPFEMALE > ever . 
I really do need a new profile picture 
< PROPFIRST > Tyler+Bee Gees+Steve < PROPFIRST > = <3 
I wish * I * always looked as happy as my nephew ! 
Reading my parents text messages to eachother is probably comparable to a baby hitting the phone keyboard for the noise it makes . 
I hate Mr. Black right now . 
Odly enough , the 13 turkey caesar torpedo song is the only radio commercial I still havnt gotten sick of . 
Did way better on my history final then I thoughht I would . I might actually come out of this class with a b . 
Hey everyone , I found some really good music everyone should know about . EVERYONE needs to go check The Deerhunter , Help ! She Can't Swim , The Fratellis , She and Him , < PROPFEMALE > & the nuclear so and so's , As Tall as Lions , Bromheads Jacket , and < PROPFEMALE > & < PROPMALE > ! Oh !!! \ 
I almost forgot , < PROPFIRST > Green !!! :D 
I would listen to < PROPFEMALE > lavigne , and know all the words . 7th grade memorys . <3 
Oh my god . I'm so insanely happy . My social studies final+ my vocab brought me from a C to a B-\ 
80.73 percent . \ 
I'm stoked . \ 
Too bad I failed my ( favorite math teacher ever !!! :D If you're reading this , i'm totally not brown nosing you < PROPFIRST > Paape!)'s final . 
40's music is so impeccably grand . 
My weight is back in the 140's! Apparently being a vegetarian isn't all that bad :D 
Zachs listening to freaking nickelback . 
Why I do believe i'm quiet smitten over you , Darling . 
Happy Fathers Day , Dad . :) 
Oh my god do you ever stop talking ? 
Zach has to be the most awesomest kid ever !!!!!!! 
Its going to be a long day . 
A scrape on the knee . A bad day . A bully's words . There are things that a mothers care can make better . \ 
But epilepsy isn't one of them . 
They\ 
say true friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never\ 
question their friendship . These types of friends pick up just like \ 
they spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been . Repost this if\ 
you are lucky enough to have at least one friend like this :) 
Zach ! Dude , do you wanna go camping ? 
Jazz gig this Saturday 26th . Details are being emailed today . 
What's up with all the gorgeous women in the mall today ? 
Going camping for the day . Be back tonight . Just if anyones curious . \ 
Hey btw hit up my formspring . 
Hood River skatepark is sooooo rad . 
It's really weird when people actually write about themselves in their about me . 
Just saw a black guy wearing a churchs fried chicken polo drinking a grape soda . Life is complete . 
Been sitting in almost dead stop traffic for more than 2 hours . I hate seattle . 
Longest drive of my life . 
Gabbi Padley and < PROPFEMALE > Crippen , my mom said she saw you guys in the fireworks stand She found you both very kind and nice , but she didn't understand < PROPFEMALE>'s large and thick glasses . And < PROPFEMALE > , she told me that you asked her about watching \Some movie 
I\ 
pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of < PROPFEMALE > , and to the\ 
Republic , for which it stands ; one Nation , UNDER GOD , indivisible , with\ 
< PROPFEMALE > and justice for all . \ 
Repost if you think God , Our Country , \ 
Our millitary the people who fought and died for out freedom , and our flag deserve respect . 
Need to get out of the house ! :O 
Hey guys , my dad is looking for someone to help him < PROPFEMALE > flyers . I don't know details regarding the pay , it's probably not much , but I know if you've got nothing better you should give him a call . 503-849-2947 
Just made some new best friends at industrial . 
Gorgeous woman everywhere , always a positive . 
400th post . 
I love you , Saline rinse . 
Jesus I have an adorable cat .

Getting up in 5 hours . Rad . 
On my way back home from 50 < PROPMALE > on the water ! It was defiantly a blast but I can't wait to get some real food . :o 
Just got done moving 600 pounds of dirt to the other side of the house . Only 3000 more to go . \

It's gonna be a good week . Excited for saturday !

Why in gods name is Neon Trees being played on z100 ? 
Apparently I look like Christian Bale . \ 
Alright alright alright 
Do girls know that they look the best in their baggy sweats and that old sweater ? 
P . S . \ 
I had an amazing night with some wonderful people and person , bowling and a movie . Cliche and sweet . ;) 
Why doesn't everyone stay up until 3am ? :( It get's lonely without all of you . 
Summer camp makes me miss some of you cool cats back home ! 
I'm so insanely tired . I'm ready to come home now . 
Facebook would be the first thing I go to check after being gone after a week . 
Cut's all over my feet . Water shoes would have been a right nice idea . 
Blow is a fantastic movie . 
40s music is the perfect way to soothe the soul during traffic . 
I'm turning into the thing I swore i'd never become . 
\Wow 
Walking in Circles before Lying down is a wonderful book :)

Massive headache . My eyes need to get used to these glasses faster . > 8 ( 
Without a phone for the weekend or more , If I don't reply , that's why . 
Chrome plays porn better than it plays youtube videos . Awesome . 
My stomach is killing me right now . 
Why yes stomach , I DO love it when you internally combust . You've already done it for three days , let's just keep it going ! ;]

Does anyone have the summer reading list for AP lit ? 
Mom gave me some good news tonight , took some stress off . :) 
Apparently a couple nights hiking get's me stoked to do it some more . Just spent the last 2 hours researching more trails , looking at camping gear on Craigslist , and even changed my desktop background to a summit view . \ 
Oh boy . \ 
( Zach Hougan < PROPMALE > Rylander ) 
Slowly but surely learning say it aint so :D 
Had a lovely time at IKEA today with < PROPFEMALE > Watson ! \ 
:D 
Just finished sparknoting all of 1984 in 40 minutes . I think I might actually do okay if we get a quiz too . We'll see eh ? 
Great day with Zach . School for 2 hours then an awesome day of golfing , good will , < PROPFIRST > meyer , and now the mall . :D 
I'd like to be in a room , just you and me . And we'll talk our eyes to sleep . 
I'm borrreed , hit me up 
I hate getting stuck behind people who go the speed limit . 
Learning < PROPFIRST > , not as intense as I thought . :D 
How has Wilco been hiding from me for this long ? 
I want attractive women to text me . I hate doing all the work of finding you guys . 
Life throws the strangest surprises , and apparently they can be rather swell . :]

Being social =<3 
Days are ever so lovely . :] 
< PROPFEMALE > SHUT THE HELL UP !!!! 
What's with my < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > craze lately ? 
I wish I could like the act of someone liking something . 
It might not be a lot , but I feel like I'm making the most . 
I guess you've gotta roll with the punches . Nothing really works out as planned . 
Oh my . Stayed up waaaay toooo late . 
My reliance on social networking is unhealthy . 
And we don't care about the young folks-talkin bout the young style . 
My dog is way too human for her own good . 
Hahaha , just had a random girl walk up to me and tell me I look like Zach Efron and that I should be in High School Musical . :p Alright alright alright . 
Haleigh , I swear you stalk me more than I do you , you've liked like 20 of my recent status updates . <3 
My name is < PROPMALE > Buchanan and I love procrastinating essays , vocab tests , and 300 < PROPFEMALE > book reads until the night before . 
Why is < PROPFIRST > A . Nguyen so much more social than < PROPFIRST > ( Nguyen) ? I see his little tuxedo clad self everywhere around these parts .

The Smiths always amaze me , they're so genuine . 
Yes rain , I do love you .

I'm so tempted to go to school in a cardigan and tie tomorrow . 
Google , you get better every day .

Is the end or just the start of something really , really beautiful ? 
Congrats on the win Spuds . :) 
After spending the past two hours looking up style tips for short guys , it's unanimous that short men must wear V-Shaped shirts , sweaters , blazers , etc . And the deeper , the better . \ 
So to all the haters , I have an excuse . :O 
Thank you so much < PROPMALE > . Reddit is the best webpage ever . 
And so it begins . Let's see where you take me this time , Life . :) 
Hi , my name is < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Herz and I have a secret crush on inanimate objects . \

I got my first stye , on me eye . I think I'll just take pictures and scrapbook this moment ! Alright ! \ 
Time to spend the day warm compressing it . I sure can't wait . :D 
Great day guys ! :D Woke up with a stye in my eye , got screamed at about my transmission for the car that isn't mine , then got yelled at about repairing our locks . On the bright side , to repair the cars transmission is going to cost more than the car is worth . \ 
YES ! :DDDD 
Just went on a run with no motivation from Zach for the first time in 3 years . \ 
Threw up like three times , but it felt damn good . \ 
Good to go . 
Going to bed , because I didn't do any of my homework . \ 
And I want to wake up at like 5am so I can do it in Starbucks . 
I've had to relieve myself at least 5 times in the past hour , and frankly , I'm getting tired of running to the bathroom right when I got comfy . 
Started < PROPMALE > Classes . All in all , pretty cool stuff . Except there's some seriously anti-social people here ! Fencing in 30 minutes . :) 
EVERYONE IS GETTING HACKED . \ 
I'm getting SO mad at these random chat bubbles popping up . 
I only have eyes for you . 
I literally wish some people where on facebook as much as me , just so I could talk to them more . 
Gotta see , gotta know right now . What's the writing on your everything ? It isn't anything at all . 
I'm always where I need to be , and I always thought I'd end up with you eventually . 
Fitness mix is sooooo good tonight . 
I'm living alone , living alone , I don't need you anymore . 
I've successfully blown two hours of valuable homework time on reddit . \ 
Oh well , I'll just wake up early . \ 
Think i'm going to go through a little personality change . People don't seem to appreciate an outgoing person . I think if I act pretentious and stuck up some people at < PROPMALE > would really like me . Being nice is just too logical .

Spending my homecoming night drinking coffee and working . \ 
I'd be lieing if I said I'm glad I didn't go . 
Cool night for me . :) Found out my Mom's employee wasted $140 in vinyl on a job that was due yesterday . He cut all of it out backwards . \ 
We couldn't figure out why he missed such on obvious mistake on 45+ft of vinyl , but it made sense when we found over 20 empty bottles of import beer just chillin throughout our shop . Luckily I get to cut it all out now . \ 
On the brighter side , I'm the coolest person in the world . 
Now < PROPFEMALE > me up to dry\ 
I'm < PROPFEMALE > like the white\

Still at work . I never thought I'd work a 9pm-5am workday rather than a 9am-5pm . \

Has anyone noticed how many people have been getting pulled over this week ? I think texting and driving isn't the best idea right now . 
Knocked out some political science homework . Now I just have to finish reading like 6 chapters in another book about how abused black people where by white people , read like a billion pages in my AP Lit book , and then finish off the night studying chapter three for PolySci . I honestly couldn't imagine my life if I had a full schedule . :) 
My email inbox has 5555 messages . 
I like it at < PROPFEMALE>'s . 
I'm so glad Im taking classes at < PROPMALE > . This is so much better than High School classes . 
I like it in a completely respectable and normal area where each of us will feel safe and comfortable to practice a sacred act of true love . 
How can we get quality government service , if we don't pay for it ? \ 
Love this class . 
Had a surprisingly awesome night , very much so unexpectedly . 
This world is strangely small . 
Today I found 2 stashed away capri suns that I had kept in my truck for emergency use , emergency's being when i don't have change to get a drink . I forgot I had them stashed their so it was the equivalent of finding money in my pants . I think this treasure stashing in my truck is going to continue , I like it . 
Waking up to the smell of rain on concrete and golf course in the distance is a lovely way to start the day . I've missed you , fall . :) 
White shoes are probably a new requirement . 
So my mom and her friend are the loudest movie watchers I know .

Modest Mouse is entirely relevant tonight . Thank you for lyrical brilliance , < PROPMALE > . 
The lack of time is sadly obvious right about now . 
Golf is the worst sport ever invented . 
Worst homework assignment ever-\ 
As I now am reading every\ 
thing on facebook as\ 
Poetry . 
It's so confusing now that everyone has these black and white photo's from homecoming . I keep getting confused on who's who . 
I'd like to formally apologize to everyone on Facebook for correcting your grammar . Spell check doesn't come equipped with every internet browser , nor does class or sentence structure . And I understand that . I'm sorry , everyone . 
EFFF 
Rage . 
My mom is the best . :) 
That's what we're waiting on , aren't we ? 
I wish I wasn't allergic to my cat . He's too cute for my own good- literally . 
And they cried to see your face . 
Good thing we picked Red < PROPFIRST > for dinner on the same night as Skyviews homecoming . 
If perfect's what your searching for then just stay the same . 
When does one compromise their standards ? 
13/25 on a PolySci quiz ? I think I'll settle for that . 
Lying on the floor I've come undone . 
I should probably get more friends . \ 
Although that's really not viable given how bad I dress .

I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day . Take me to the place I love , take me all the way . 
I love fall . Everything is gorgeous . 
I have a teeth grinding problem , and I hate it . 
You wasted life , why wouldn't you waste the afterlife ? 
I'll follow you into the dark . 
Hi , everyone . 
When I was young and moving fast , nothing slowed me down , slowed me down . 
Teaching 8th graders how to play today . :) I'm excited , I think ? 
My Fridays never feel like Fridays anymore . I look forward to my week more than my weekends now . Crazy stuff . 
I got home at 3:00 and fell asleep until just now . How I managed to get 7 hours of sleep during a nap is beyond me . 
Hi , I'm < PROPMALE > . \ 
I spend my fridays sleeping and trolling reddit . \ 
Thanks for destroying my social life , Mat Lefebvre 
I hate college , school , life , scouts , and any other stress that's currently keeping me up right now , at 4:25 in the morning . \ 
Blah 
Peppermint ice cream = <3 
Another sucky weekend . I need to stop making myself available to help people . 
Forever is a long long time when you've lost your way . 
It's crazy how Music changes my mood instantly . 
Playing < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > and looking at the rain go by on the balcony is the best medicine anyone can ask for . 
Learning a new Modest Mouse song is a wonderful pleasure . :] 
To the 30 or so screaming women at my Mom's party , \ 
I really appreciate the harmonics you all have , while your screeching yell somehow pummels straight through my ( already closed ) door . I also really am curious where you got that new bra , and how your love life is going with < PROPMALE > , so thank you for sharing . I really do appreciate that new information . \ 
With love , \ 
Me , that \one kid in the next room . \"" 
It's honestly been a great day . :) 
First person to like my status i will keep their last name for a week =) post this on your wall and see what kinda last name you will have . 
Waking up to a rainy morning is easily one of the best parts of living in the northwest . :) 
Does anyone know if Banana Pancakes are good ? Because every time I hear that song I crave them . 
Changing my last name early , just because it's strange not seeing it proper . 
And though its been a long time , you're right back where you started from . 
Just letting you all know I'm way better than you . 
Muchas Gracias is so good 
94.7 is playing Ra Ra Riot . Yes . :] 
Adults are so awkward on Facebook . They don't get it . 
Sunday Bloody Sunday 
I see heatwaves can't complain\ 
If the world's at large why should I remain ? 
If you guys even knew how excited I am for the next Desperate Housewives , I don't even .... \ 
I think I'm looking forward to it more than Halloween . 
$93 closer to getting my fusion pass . 
Finally got my Fusion Pass ! 
Trying to learn her favorite Kings of < PROPFIRST > song . She doesn't know it , but tonight , after I pick her up from the house and put the kids to sleep , she's in for a romantic surprise . \ 
<3<3<3 
I'd like to think I'm pretty alright . :) 
Hey all Ridgefield kids who are goin to the dance ; don't worry about keeping the dancing clean , worst case scenario you get kicked out . I'm sure you've heard why :) It won't matter in the long run if you do though . Thanks for your cooperation :) 
Mountain today ! 
If anybodys curious the mountain was amazing . 
I never understood why girl's ( always ) < PROPFEMALE > a camera with them , but thinking about it now- it WOULD be nice to have a decent way to take good pictures , rather than a cell phone . 
Missing Senior Night tonight , It's too mainstream for me . 
So pretty much , having an amazing weekend . \ 
Apparently , I'm getting taller ( probably the highlight of life right now)\ 
Mountain Tomorrow\ 
Mountain Monday (?) \ 
< PROPFIRST>'s tonight , followed by < PROPMALE > . 
Republiderps and Herpocrats 
Just broke into a car , feeling a little bit cool 
Another wonderful day at the mountain . :D 
Ibuprofen , you should probably kick in pretty soon . 
SOOOOOO MANY POLITICAL VIDEOS . \ 
I need to stop procrastinating homework . \ 
On a better note , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is saving my sanity at the moment . 
If I die before I awake I pray to lord my soul to take , because I'm ready for a funeral . 
Cudi is such a good start to the morning . 
I know that staying positive is the only way to reap positive results , but it would be nice if they came sooner . 
I'm sorry but I just really love my cat . When he purrs it makes my life suddenly seem worth a billion dollars , just because he get's so much satisfaction out of a little belly scratch . <3 
Why do people get off on others misfortunes ? 
I never realized how much fur my cat had until I switched to a black bedspread . Oh my . 
Political Science is No Bueno right now . 
Salmon Creek Subway has the rudest employees ever . 
I'm really starting to love the club mizes on 94.7 . (: 
I think my cat and I are becoming best friends . He's been laying on my bed all day , and it's been great bonding time . <3 
My name is < PROPFEMALE > and I hate facial hair , blah blah blah . 
The one night that I have like 5 hours of homework to do , everybody on Facebook decides to talk to me . Perfect . 
Honestly , when it all comes down to it , I have a really great Dad . \ 
Despite our differences I couldn't be more thankful . 
:/ No snowboarding tomorrow . 
I get to write an essay tonight . :) I sure do love Political Science . Such great education . 
I need to get started on this essay but I seriously cannot focus for the life of me . Procrastination is a terrible disease , and cat's are the world's greatest distraction . 
Can't even keep a window open . :/ 
In December drinking Horchata 
Phoenix puts me in such a good mood . (: 
< PROPFIRST > Barr , \ 
You're the coolest guy to ever come to Ridgefield . I've always secretely tried to be like you , so its even harder now that you're leaving . You've always been cool enough to < PROPFEMALE > out with us , so if/when you come back , we'll have to arrange something . So long big guy . 
Young Folks techno remix ? Yes please . :) 
I'm thinking about unsubscribing from Facebook Mobile updates , simply because that's 80% of my messages . \ 
And I'm usually already on Facebook as they send , so it just lets me know how many people don't want to connect on a personal level , but rather in an annoying public way . \ 
Actually , that's not true . I love all of you . 
< PROPFEMALE > Summerall I can't stay up anymore , I've fallen asleep 3 times and I just can't do it . I'll see you in the morning Sis . Sleep well tonight . :) \ 
<3 Love you 
Sister is here ! :D 
Hey , Oregon Trail , you're the most dumb game ever created . I hate you . 
Just applied at OSU . :] WSU and UW's are already brewing , now I just need to wait until March to find out who wants me ! \ 
And take the SAT's\ 
But , that's easy enough . 
Really debating if two extra credit assignments are worth coming out of PolySci with an A . \ 
We'll see . 
God works unmistakable miracles . Honestly , nothing is more comforting than knowing I'm always protected with his love . 
Worst part of having a 2 year old visit ( give or take ) isn't actually him , its the rest of my family that compulsively HAS TO scream when they talk to him . Who cares that its 6am ? \ 
Oh the pleasures of having family over . 
Rest in peace , Grandma . 
This world is so beautiful . 
And when I wake up , you look so pretty sleeping next to me . 
So , \ 
No school , on Thursday , and Friday . Mountain is coming one of those days . 
So , Narwhales , they're real . \ 
Mindblown . 
I miss just being genuinly happy . 
And know that worrying is about as effective as trying to solve an alegbra problem by chewing bubblegum . 
I'm so fortunete to have a Mom that loves me as much as she does . 
Today is a good day . :] Glad to have things worked out . 
Best part about coming back from the mountain ( aside from Portland adventures ) is looking in the mirror and realizing you've gotten ( just ) a little bit more tan . 
I really think I'm starting to like cats more than dogs . Oh my . 
That wasn't the greatest camp out . 
I can't decide if I look younger or older than my age . I'm too short to look 17 , but my face looks like it could be like , 19 . Maybe , only with glasses . \ 
I probably look like I'm 14 , but one who dresses like a 19 year old flamer . 
The last 12 pages of r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu are filled with purple links . I've got to stop this . 
Maybe you'll marry , maybe you won't , maybe you'll have children , maybe you won't , maybe you'll divorce at 40 , maybe you'll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary . Whatever you do , don't congratulate yourself too much or berate yourself , either . Your choices are half < PROPMALE > , so are everybody else's . 
I know I'm easily one of the coolest people in the world . But my mom is hands down THE coolest . If you're reading this Mom , I love you . [: \

Oh don't mind me , just saying up until midnight to watch Desperate Housewives . 
I feel so old . I can't even stay up til 1am anymore or ill feel like total crap the next day . Anything under 8 hours isn't even worth it . :p 
Sometimes I'm amazed by this worlds events . Has anyone ever had that moment when you're just at your absolute low , and that one song comes on the radio ? That one that you just needed to hear ? 
Thanks to < PROPFEMALE>'s little blog , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is now ringing throughout our entire household . :p 
My mom made cream filled chocolate-chocolate cupcakes . \ 
Prepare to see me gain at least 10 pounds this week , lads . 
Shaving off my hair . 
Having a shaved head could honestly be one of the weirdest feelings I've ever had . 
Sooooooooooooooooooooo tired 
Whoa that was a long nap . 
So when my cat wants my attention , he digs his nails into my arm , and pulls . At first softly , but progressively harder , and harder , and harder , until it finally hurts me too much to ignore him . \ 
That manipulative little feline knows me too well . 
I'm so insanely bored . \ 
Everyone must be at < PROPMALE > Potter or something . 
Just posting another status update , problem ? 
You know what ? Being cynical hasn't gotten me anywhere but where I don't want to be . Things are going to turn around and I'm tired of being negative about life . I think I'm just going to start being optimist , because that's always been much more productive , and nobody likes a downer . \ 
Someone text me . :) I'll make you feel special . In a completely non sexual way . :p \ 
All of us have some good , let's make it known ! 
Life has decided it wants me to start prioritizing . Growing up isn't so easy , but it's all for the best . 
We are always running for the thrill of it thrill of it\ 
Always pushing up the hill searching for the thrill of it\

Forecasts are dumb , it says Ridgefield is 40° right now . \ 
I don't see how you guys get snow , Vancouver has nothing . 
I can't believe Mr. T . Still gets endorsements for thee things . 
So , < PROPFIRST > Pilgrim could be the strangest movie I've ever seen , but its easily one of the best . 
It's Friday I'm in love . 
Making fun of people who can't drive in the snow is really easy until you realize you're one of them . 
So , \ 
Timberline is currently zero degrees , with 17 inches of new snow in the last 24 hours . \ 
Who's going up to Timberline tommorow ? 
The dog days are over . 
You know what the perfect accompaniment to this lovely weather is ? \ 
Vampire Weekend . \ 
And smores . 
I think , that making a point to smile at anyone that you even remotely like , just a little bit , whenever you see them , is a really good thing . 
Happy Thanksgiving guys , we all have something good going for us , let's keep those things in mind as we go on today . :] 
Minecraft . 
Waking up in 4 hours . \ 
Black Friday . \ 
Then snowboarding for 6+ more hours . My sleep pattern makes sense . 
Apparently , the main attraction of Iceland is Sigur Rós , according to Iceland's tourist site . 
I really miss my hair .

I'm actually really excited for Econ101 ( or whatever it is)\ 
I just spent the last hour reading the Economist . I'm sure the class will be just like studying that , right ? 
Waitlisted on 2/3 of my < PROPMALE > classes . \

Hey guys , I snowboard . My social status just magically goes up right ?, \

I really needed that episode of Glee . 
The best way to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust them . \ \ 
So , todays going to be really good . First sign that I know this ? Starbucks gave me a Venti instead of a Grande . \ 
Aaahhhh yeah . 
Whenever I see \Ibuprofen\ " I always say \ " I < PROPFEMALE > you pro fen\ " in my head . \ 
I'm so cool . You guy's don't even know . \ 
I'm awesome . 
Nothing is worse than hearing someone point out something about yourself that you know is true . 
2pm ~ 4pm = Worst time of the day . I'm soooooo tired . 
I just want everyone to know my room is now amazing . 
As a child , we all can't wait for time to speed up , so we can get older . Now I just wish time would slow the hell down and let me catch up . 
Listening to the patter of my cat's nails against the floors throughout my house at the moment . I must say , it makes me smile . :] 
Why am I so awesome tonight ? 
Study for the math part for SAT's or ..... Reddit . \ 
Decision made .

I'm failing the math section of the SAT's tomorrow . Just letting everyone know . 
Good Morning World 
SAT's=Way too much fun for me to handle . 
Dude 
One day you will see that it all has finally come together . \ 
What you have always wished for has finally come to be . \ 
You will look back and laugh at what has passed and you will ask yourself , \ 
\How did I get through all of that ? \ " \ 
Nursing my poor cat . :( He got in a little < PROPFEMALE > street brawl ( fight night edition , I'm sure ) and has had a split ear the past couple of days , but hid it until today . Many meow's and some disinfectant later , I'm hoping he'll be okay . Of course now he's avoiding me because nobody likes to have their war wounds taken care of . 
Just sent a 21 < PROPFEMALE > text . \ 
Not gonna lie , I'm sort of impressed with myself .

A Catfood ad , selling healthiness to my pet . \ 
VVV\ 
LEARN TO SHRED BRO !!!! YEAHHHHHHH\ 
VVVVV\ 
JOIN THE < PROPFEMALE > CORPS AND GET SOME\ 
Another cat add . \ 
VVVV\ 
Enter your pets photo and get paid ! \ 
Hahahaha , facebook knows me too well . 
I'm going to have to stop watching snowboarding videos . It get's me way too stoked , way too early . \ 
I'm about ready to go run outside and jib on a curb or something . 
This weekend felt like another brake . I don't want to go to school tomorrow just as bad as I didn't after thanksgiving break . 
New Orleans is an epitome for the jazz and swing scene nearly worldwide . Next time I visit , I'm going for the right reasons . :) 
Another amazing day at the mountain . 
I hate finals , especially when the professor isn't even clear on what he's testing on . Let me just go study 40 different concepts , no biggie . 
I hate when girls go from natural red to something else . Such a waste of a beautiful color . 
\The tragedy of it is that nobody sees the look of desperation on my face . Thousands and thousands of us 
I wish people at < PROPMALE > where more talkative . Next quarter , yeah ? :) 
My < PROPMALE > just froze on me for the first time in four years . \ 
Time to reformat . 
Everyone else is doing it . \ 
Go do it . \ 
You know you want to . \ 
Post that status update . \ 
Go tell people what you think about them . \ 
It makes you cool . 
Rain on the window . 
Why doesn't the little shrimp share ? \ 
Because he's a little SHELLFISH ! \ 
lolololololololololololololololol 
\You gotta remember 
If only life where like an 80's movie . :) 
My mom is forcing me to move my room to the other side of the house , but the only thing that's changing is blue walls to an earthy green , and a bigger closet plus a view of the golf course . Pretty sure she gets the short end of the stick here . I'm moving up to executive level now . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is the perfect accompaniment to my wake up routine . 
Why does my cat have a compulsive need to try and follow me into the bathroom ? 
Such a perfect day , it's amazing what 13 hours with friends and fun times can do . 
So , in PolySci I did better on the final I didn't study for at all , than on the one that I put effort into . Coincidently , the one that I didn't study for was the same one where I was mostly \out of class\ " when the material was being covered . \ 
I don't want tomorrow to end . I'm going to miss all of you so much . To whole weeks without my peers to brighten the day . And I won't even have homework to occupy my time . Whatever will I do ? 
The dance turned out to be pretty alright . :] 
“Man often becomes what he believes himself to be . If I keep on saying to myself that I cannot do a certain thing , it is possible that I may end by really becoming incapable of doing it . On the contrary , if I have the belief that I can do it , I shall surely acquire the capacity to do it even if I may not have it at the beginning . ”\ 
- Mahatma Gandhi 
You know , I wish I was a cat . They seem to have life figured out . If this world was run by cats I honestly believe it would be a better place . 
Dude being short sucks . 
Only downside to having like 3000 songs is figuring out which ones are actually good . 
Apparently there was a lunar eclipse last night/tonight . 
1710 on the SAT's . Not the greatest but I'm alright with it considering it was my first time even taking it . :) 
It's our tendency to go day after day repeating the same routine regardless of how pointless some of the things might be . Even if a better opportunity unveils itself , so many people refuse to take it . Maybe it's changing cell plans to a service that's considerably less , or getting back in a relationship with the ex , even though it's the 7th time to count . What if everyone tried something different for a day ? 
Yeah so , it's really cold in here . 
I feel like such a rebel for refusing to change my facebook profile to the new one . 
The personal change that takes place from the start of High School to Senior Year is insane . 
I just found out my car's CD player works . \ 
Guess who's going to be making playlist for the rest of the day . 
A extremely k00l person beat me by 20 minutes on posting how great of a night it has been . \ 
Lights , Bookstores , craft shops , pet places , all topped with future prospects of an abandoned house . And I even managed to meet the family , half of it by < PROPMALE > . :] \ 
It was great indeed . \ 
If anyones curious , it was a k00 night . 
Today is a Modest Mouse day . 
My dad just sent me a text asking me how to spell \cathlick \"" 
Mountain tomorrow , bright and early . \ 
Or rather , dark and early . 
To think that I've just had at least two months of mental dilemma solved by one article . \ 
That in itself is a wonderful gift . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone . 
If I didn't think it was redundant , I'd post music videos every 20 seconds . \ 
I spend way too much time on Youtube . 
Going on a returning spree at Macys come Monday . \ 
But for everything , < PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone . :) 
I got a straight edge for Christmas . \ 
I was more excited over my new $8 shaving blade than I was for the three < PROPFEMALE > boxes . \ 
Haha . 
I just want to fly , put yours arms around me baby . 
Thinking about being a vegetarian again . Or at the very least eating less meat . 
5am seems like the perfect time to go to bed . 
Applebees officially has a new Bananagramers club . :) \ 
Haha , I had a lovely night with the < PROPFIRST > sisters . The entire restaurant couldn't compete with our board game bonanza , we blew the place away . ;) 
Gazing out the window and watching the rain all while figuring out new tab to < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . It's been one of those days . 
A < PROPFEMALE > day in December is the perfect medicine . 
I'll meet you at the cemetery gates . 
Yeah phone , it's totally cool . I don't care if you turn off on me , right in the middle of my 5 < PROPFEMALE > text . No big deal bro , you know , i'll just do it all over again . It's not your fault . 
August Rush plus Guitar Repair and whatever other oddities that happen , all with one super k00l lady ? \ 
Tomorrow = One great day . :) Night facebook . 
What a great time . :) \ 
I'm loving life right now . 
I'm out of cheese . \ 
This is a huge problem . 
DIY network is housewife crack . \ 
.... and mine ... 
All my little plans and schemes\ 
Lost like some forgotten dreams\ 
Seems that all I really was doing\ 
Was waiting for you 
Take a step back for a second and just smile . Forget everything else going on in life . Forget the stress , heartache , pain , deception , or whatever else . For one second , forget all of it , and just smile . Whatever's happening right now is entirely insignificant to the limitless joy our short timeline has to offer . Seek it , and don't stop until you've found it . 
I just can't get you off my mind , and why would I even try ? 
I was going to go to bed 2 and a half hours ago . Why in the world did I click the facebook icon ? 
Best part about this online Econ class is going to be trolling the discussion boards like crazy and getting points for it . 
I swear I was blind before I met you . 
My cat likes < PROPFEMALE > . \ 
:) 
Even if for just a little bit , my night was great . 
It's a gorgeous day . 
I have a newfound love for tea- namely chamomile . 
Why do people care so much about football ? 
:] What a great day . \ 
1/11/11 
Nostalgia . 
I never could do that which might hurt you , so stay cool . 
I've been blessed with so many wonderful people , and things in my life . I couldn't be more thankful . :) 
Opinions were like kittens , I was giving them away . 
Even with a sleepy disposition and hair caked in soap , she's still the most beautiful person I've ever laid eyes on . 
Oh don't mind me econ project , I'll just procrastinate you for another 5 days . It's whatever . 
Cough\ 
Y U NO GO AWAY 
I know a thing or two about a thing or two . 
This day is unmatched in it's level of perfection . :] 
\Oh so they make vegetarian fries at Burgerville now ? That's cool ! \ " \ 
My cat now has a facebook . \ 
It's whatever . 
It's those little things that evoke the greatest joy . One could get a new job , find a new passion , or any other momentous life changing event . But at the end of the day , it's that cute text from your significant other , maybe a newfound affection from your cat , or something like the discovery of an old game boy that spawns the greatest happiness I've yet to experience . \ 
Just , the little things . 
If you must write prose and poems\ 
The words you use should be your own\ 
Don't plagiarise or take on loans\ 
There's always someone , somewhere\ 
With a big nose , who knows\ 
And who trips you up and laughs\ 
When you fall\ 
Who'll trip you up and laugh\ 
When you fall 
I love having a < PROPFEMALE > to greet me every time I walk in my room . :] 
Coughing up mucus like a boss . 
It's day one , yet I miss you already ... And to think there's two more weeks of this . 
Its so weird being a < PROPMALE > student and listening to everyone freak out about finals . 
Finally getting back Into the swing of things . Life is good . :) 
Jazz choir did awesome at < PROPMALE > today ! Great job guys . :) 
I'm starting to become a really lazy typist . 
wut 
I took too much Nyquil ... 
Sometimes , happiness is simply pasta and garlic bread . 
A world of pixels just doesn't match that feeling of being there . 
Does anyone know who's hiring right now ? 
Be careful whose advice you buy , but , be patient with those who \ 
supply it . Advice is a form of nostalgia , dispensing it is a way of \ 
fishing the past from the disposal , wiping it off , painting over the \ 
ugly parts and recycling it for more than it’s worth . 
Putting off my senior paper until the 30 minutes before school starts . \ 
I see no issue here . 
Well , holy moly me-oh-my , you're the apple of my eye Girl , I've never loved one like you . 
It's ain't the universe , it's the Ludaverse . 
I feel like it should take me longer than 45 seconds to down a full sized orange . 
Apparently some thieves are meeting at some green body of water and duking it out tomorrow . 
Today was such a great day . :] 
I hate when 94.7 says \Here's the newest from ( so and so) ! \ " \ 
Ailurophile 
Yoga with the girl tonight . :] 
\It's never to late to have a Skype date ! \ " \ 
How many hipsters does it take to change a light bulb ? 
94.7 couldn't have played The Strokes at a better time . :) 
Socks are an absolute necessity . 
It's right . It's just so ... right . 
Just watching The Magic School bus . No big deal . 
I couldn't be happier to have the blessing of spending this Valentines Day with one spectacular girl . Happy Valentines day < PROPFEMALE > . :) 
I don't understand how barre chords STILL hurt . 
This eagle project just needs to be over and done with . 
And to lie here awake with only you on my mind is insomnia that's always welcome in my thoughts . \ 
Until tomorrow , world . :) 
Has anyone else been extremely thirsty , all the time , lately ? And tired ? 
If anyone is going to the Young the Giant concert , tell me how it is ! 
So , I've got my eagle project finished . 
Only love is all maroon , Gluey feathers on a flume . \ 
Sky is womb and she's the < PROPFEMALE > 
I've seriously got to stop having the munchies . 
Oh dear , its been hardly a moment and you are already missed . 
No matter what I do , all I think about is you . \ 
( < PROPFEMALE > is where its at today ) 
9º at the mountain and 15 inches of new snow ? \ 
Perfect . :] Anyone else going to Timberline today ? 
GR8 night with the girl . Apparently lap swimmers at the Martial Center think the world revolves around them- or at least the pool . \ 
It was still wonderful , regardless . :] 
I'm so jealous that the girls get to play tennis every day after school . I would take spring tennis over spring baseball any day . 
\I want to turn your face into an ipod app . \ " \ 
Life is good . SO good . :] 
If every simple song I wrote to you would take your breath away , i'd write it all . 
Eagle Project is officially done and signed off ! Just have to write my goals letters and it's boards for me . :) Can't wait for it to all be done ! 
Who cares if the world is watching ? Always take the time to love the one you're with . 
When I was a kid , I had three songs that I KNEW , by heart , and it was ALL I listened to . It varied from a Black Eyed Peas song , to the Sweet Victory cover that Spongebob did in the superdome ( this was on cassette , via my walkman ) . \ 
I never grew tired of them\ 
But anymore , I don't even know the lyrics to 80% of the songs in my Itunes library . \ 
What happened ? I think I need to devote my life to learning my library ... 
Why would I get up to close my door when I could just throw a pillow at it ? 
I'd like to be in a room , just you and me . We'll talk our eyes to sleep . And when its over and we part you'll remain inside my heart . You see , I can't forget your face . 
Proud new member of LA Fitness ! 
Choir did soooooo good . :) 
Times like these . 
Looking at what's been taken from us in life is a bad idea . Looking at what we can give to others is a far better idea . 
Had a wonderful time at the gym with < PROPFEMALE > . :] 
Eggs could honest be the most disgusting thing I've ever had the displeasure of tasting . 
Good thing facebook implemented this hit enter to post a comment thing . Now we can all facebook like it's IM . And spam everyone's notification bar because they forget that enter doesn't do what enter is ment to do . 
I'm such a lucky man . :) Life is goooooood . 
I think everyone should get the < PROPMALE > to witness a really cute old couple at least once a day . It just makes the whole entire day so much better . 
Middle aged women talk SO loud . 
God danced the day you were born . 
Tonight , is Tie Dye . \ 
Tomorrow , is an entire day with my favorite lady . : )\ 
Then tolo . \ 
Awwwwwwww Yeeaaaahhh 
I can't keep up with all of you posting on my wall ! Future thanks to anyone who wishes me a Happy Birthday and more thanks to everyone who already has . :) 
I miss golfing . 
I have such an amazing girlfriend . Thank you for a perfect Birthday < PROPFEMALE > , it means the world . :) 
The old believe everything : the middle-aged suspect everything : the young know everything . 
Cheese Pizza and Redbull ? Probably the best dinner I could ever enjoy . 
In this minute , we were infinite . 
I had such a terrible day . 
I think at least half of the tennis team has updated their status to B-Web's infamous quote by now . 
I've been living off of Peanut Butter and Jelly and Lucky Charms for the past 3 weeks . I need to go shopping . 
On Celebrity Apprentice the biggest and primary event my dad got most worked up over is how one bro stole another's paint . \ 
You don't EVER steal a man's paint .
