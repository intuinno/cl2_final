If a conservative is homosexual , they quietly enjoy their life . \ 
If a liberal is homosexual , they loudly demand legislated respect . If\ 
a black man or Hispanic is conservative , they see themselves as \ 
independently successful . Their liberal counterparts see themselves as \ 
victims in need of ? government protection . 
my stomach is now officially six flags and my liver is swiss cheese

when is it that my time will come . In the past it seemed like hedonism would be the answer to success , but has only been a successful contributor to the downfall . Why does the dark rain burn the floor , but yet people still bathe in a manner so masochistic ? Self destruction has replaced ambition , and apathy has taken control 
Im so damn psyched for my piano class , god i love college :)

goodnight everyone 
Idc wtf anyone says , i feel safe in the eye of the tornado 
The soothing air of flight ... \ 
a bird's eye view into what I've always imagined life could be . \ 
Will it be sought after ? \ 
It might just be useless writing and ideas that laziness will corrupt in the end . \ 
Bones of dust need hardening . I think the prescription is found . \ 
Sleep on ... fly on . \ 
In your mind , you can fly .

kansas is fucking amazing ... why are they so underrated again ? 
i'm giving up metal ( not entirely , read further for info ) . I dont mind heavy sounds , but i will now embrace what is true beauty to me , and that is progressive rock 
Cast this shadow long that I may hide my face \ 
And in this cloak of darkness the world I will embrace \ 
In all that I endure , of one thing I am sure \ 
Knowledge and reason change like the season \ 
A jester's promenade 
\Did it hurt ? \ " \ " What ? \ " \ " When you fell from heaven ... \ " \ " Aaawww :) \ " \ " Because your face is FUUUCKED UP . \ " that is a SICK group name "

I know what will be

Happy birthday < PROPFIRST > lennon ! 
Sulking drained the fall of my pale will\ 
Swarming by your steps\ 
Licking the ankles of your blasphemer guilts\ 
It only meant to drape a plastic \ 
Over the stuck pig scalp of head\ 
To cover the sock where to flatline had spread\ 
The kiosk in my temporal lobe\ 
Is shaped like Rasalyn Carter\ 
She says my map is home again , But torn face down\ 
I have only but a million blemishes \ 
To tell you all about

Who else is down to go on a binge towards destroying livers with me ? 
I feel no emotion 
Psychosis creeps in as an amalgimation of death of self identity finds its way into a true morbid reality , the perfect synthesis of death and fear , a socket of which anger is replaced by a white light of contemption , damn the fools who find peace in their own mediocrity , as they are more priveledgex than they deserve 
Before i forget , the concept of soul and body are seperate entities forced into competition between the chemical and the abstract , relevance is inconsequential and logic fails in explanation of that we do not understand . 
Fuck new jersey

Wisdom teeth out , pain in 
My stupid mother put the thermostat at 90 . Im on a heavy amount of vicodin and beer , stupid bitch is gonna keep me nauseous all night 
Medicate me , infiltrate me , side effects appear , as my conscience slips away
