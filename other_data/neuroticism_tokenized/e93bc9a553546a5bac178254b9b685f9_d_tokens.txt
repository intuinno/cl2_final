My mom says she likes her ringtone so much that she refuses to pick up the phone , she is truly my mother . 
so i found one of my first Ripley's book , completely ruined by the kid i babysit -_- it's not my attachment to it , it's the whole fact that they tried to hide it from me , i would like to add that this is the kid who broke all my crayons out of boredom . ( i learned that he also broke his dad's staircase .... how do u break one of those ? ) 
biting off the heads of helpless animal crackers . yummm self-esteem

insanity is doing something over and over again expecting different results , so i guess that the human race as a whole is insane since hatred+violence does not = content or happiness .

it's so awkward when your whole family of 4 guys and 2 girls are watching T.V. when a < PROPFEMALE>'s secret commercial comes on ..... 
cant wait till the Green Hornet comes out , i so need to watch that movie ! 
MoM : * Comes home with 3 packs of chocolate stuff * I thought you'd like to give some of these to your friends . \ 
me : Mom .... I have more than 3 friends\ 
Mom : Really ? Ok ill get you another one tommorow . \ 
me : Um .. i think i have more than 4 friends . \ 
Mom : You know < PROPFEMALE > you don't have to lie to get chocolate , you can just ask . 
oh i just stood up and stretched for the 1st time in 2 hours , oh that felt good ! 
has just experienced that aweful taste you get when you drink orange juice after brushing your teeth . 
So I saw Mr. Davis today at the parks mall , i freaked out , because i forgot his name . My mom said i looked \flustered \"" 
Some guy asked me what I wanted for Christmas , I told him to get me a Giraffe so he wouldn't have to get me anything , he didn't get the joke and spent 3 hours in the mall trying to find a Giraffe . \ 
Khanh < PROPFEMALE > , you suck < obvious sarcasm 
you know those 3-D chalk drawing ? I'd like to draw one of a giant sink hole set up a camera , and watch my mom freak out when she tries to park the car . 
Me : -pulls out duct tape-\ 
< PROPFEMALE > : What the freak ? Why do you have duct tape in your bag ? And why THAT color ?! \ 
Me : I'm prepared for everything , < PROPFEMALE > . -pulls out paddle ball , extra phone , folders , and solar panel-\ 
< PROPFEMALE > : For what ?! 
So i finally convinced myself to watch the live action avatar movie , 15 minutes into it , my mom , dad , brothers hated it . Why ? Because all the actors over-acted and the director's interpretation of the whole series was just all ... there's not even a word for it -.- it just sucks 
today was the winter solstice , and it was 87 degrees outside !! 
I hate how , in some shows and movies , the good guys gang up on the bad guy ; it's not fair . 
Happy 2 Days Till Christmas Day ! 
I hate that awkward feeling you ( as a non-chinese speaking asian ) get , when a random person comes up to you and says \Arigato . \ " while bowing . " 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas ! Watched inception with my family while waiting for < PROPFEMALE > , it was pretty cool . I'm afraid to go to sleep . 
Finds it amazing how someone can suppress years worth of anger into one sigh . 
So I guess my teacher thought i was waving around a bag of illegal substances today , if it were drugs it would explain alot ( they were rubberbands )

Has just found out that her phone may have been stolen , its a black 2nd gen . iphone that's missing a button , - funny side of the story i slipped 20 dollars into the phone case(phone case is black with animal-abuse awarness stickers ) this morning , lucky thief . Anyways if anyone sees it , tell or tell the person to send me all my photos back ! because spent a long time working on a drawing in my iphone . 
so i was was watching the guardian of ga'hoole ... and it was AWESOME ( understatement ) i was like :O the whole time . I mean these are like owls with like freaking swords and they're just , like , FWOOSH !! And the < PROPMALE > was so awesome , iv'e never seen such a good visual interpretation of a book ! 
It's hard to live in a house with people who oppose most of your belief system . 
watching resident evil : afterlife ..... so all these people can keep their faces clean shaven and keep their eyelashes mascara-ed after weeks of being under siege- amazing- zombies where awesome 
so it's snowing , and i got my phone back-yay 
person one : night talk to you tomorrow =) \ 
person two : K night ! <3 u !!! \

If every part of our body has a purpose , what do eyebrows do besides showing off our emotions ?

It's amazing how so many people our age can pray and mourn for the victims of 9/11 when most of us didn't know any of them . But then when you think about , it's not , because we will never forget , it's what we're supposed do . 9/11 will always be a part of American history . God bless the victims , the heroes and their family and friends . Bless those who have been wrongly accused because of al-queda and racism .

That one moment when you're in bed ready to fall asleep- but then you spot a creepy shadow- you know it's just your jacket and chair- you get up after 15 minutes of trying to ignore it and to rearrange it 
If at first you don't succeed - google 
So ... my lowest grade in infinite campus is < PROPMALE > -_- I fail at the one thing I think is sort of easy 
Stupid cancer . We all want a new car , a new phone . A person who has cancer only wants one thing ... to survive . I know that a lot of you \who think you're too cool\ " probably won't re-post this . But a very small amount of my friends will . Put this on your wall in honor of someone who died of cancer or someone fighting it . "
