We need a world in which society forgets the hate for the people's color , religion , nationality . Hate is what has led to wars , poverty , killings , etc . We can make a difference , when we don't like something , we have to show up , and say : ENOUGH . Its enough what society has faced due to racism . We can stop these kind of th ... ings , we need to be aware of people who incite the evil ...
