Apparently the cause of death for the birds in Arkansas are the fireworks that went off during New Year's celebration . Sooo ... after so many years , the fireworks finally give all those birds heart attacks ? \ 
Let's not forget that 100k fish also died at the same time . I'm guessing they're going to blame the fireworks for that too . 
I've got the strangest craving for some quesadillas ... 
Mr. ( Doctor ) Phil ... \
