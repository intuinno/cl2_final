* This movie makes me hate koreans . 
I'm eating butter . I shan't share it . 
I'm so cold . I can't get warmer . 
I hate this place . 
Today , I went to Subway ( Eat Fresh ! ) to get a sandwich . I wore my black Jackcap . The guy who made my sandwich , I noticed was stoned . His eyes were pretty red and he asked me what sandwich I wanted twice . Then , instead of putting the meat I ordered , he put loads of Bacon . So I had , instead of a BLT , a bacon sandwich . I didn't mention anything , because I wanted to taste the bacon sandwich . It wasn't very good . 
FacebookStalker , you reading this ? Ahahaha . I see you . 
I'm tired . 
If anyone needs Econ Classnotes , i type mine up . Ask me for them .

Yeah , I still have some econ notes , if anyone wants them . 
No one is online . I feel so lonely . 
I don't like Economics class . It's hard to stay awake . 
If anyone wants a copy of the Econ homework , I'll be finished soon . It's not long . I might even make a study guide . Maybe . 
Oh no , the last problem involves math . 
My throat hurts . 
I had a nice conversation . 
Economics #16 needs math skills that I lack . Therefore , I will retire for the rest of the night . Hopefully I didn't mess up my patterns too much . 
Tell me something profound .

I am going to eat so much Korean food when I go home ! 
So I find out I've had unlimited texting for three months now . D'oh! 
When it is time for me to study , I suddenly become a neat freak and start vacuuming . 
I just ate so much Korean food , and I've only been back for two hours .
