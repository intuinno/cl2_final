Remembering and thinking of the two little angels that are in heaven ... :-( \ 
We love and miss you very much . 
This month we\ 
remember all babies born sleeping or whom we have carried but never\ 
met , or those we have held but could not take home or the ones that\ 
came home but didn't stay . Make this your profile status if you or\ 
someone you know had suffered the loss of a baby . Break the silence . In\ 
memory of all lost angels .... 
I like it in the car or on my desk but it has to be on the table if in a restaurant . 
Off to Baltimore for 3 days for the start of my < PROPMALE > certification for work . Three days without my little man may seriously kill me . Does anyone have extra nerve pills ? I think I may need several . 
2 days down , 1 LOOONNGGG 8 hour stretch to go and then home to see my favorite two men !! I miss you Jerm and < PROPMALE > !! 
It's Mommy Week ... post the date and time you became a mommy !!! \
