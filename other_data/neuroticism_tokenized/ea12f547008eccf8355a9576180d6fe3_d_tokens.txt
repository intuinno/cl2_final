“Sometimes it’s easier to pretend that something is not happening rather than deal with it in the cold light of day . I was learning to be very good at that . Sometimes I felt that there were too many painful things in this world , and if I thought about them all , my heart might just break in two . ” - < PROPFEMALE > Curie
