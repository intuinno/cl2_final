... I miss < PROPFEMALE > . Can't wait till August . For a variety of reasons actually . =] Contest Friday and Saturday . 
... it really is ridiculous how much I miss < PROPFEMALE > and family . Two weeks left till the APUSH Test and a week till the AP Calc test after that I don't exactly know what it is I'll do with all my time . ^^ ; St. < PROPFIRST > in two months ! =] 
... Thank you , < PROPFIRST > Lynch . =] 
... Not going to school tomorrow . Taking an AP Calc exam instead . Actually ... I'm rather happy about it . ^^ ; I'm feeling sort of ill though . 
... My mother is leaving today . \Can't you go be a doctor later ? \"" 
... Wanna tell me why I call every plot twist in every video game , ever ? Called it on Fang and Vanille . =] 
You know , < PROPMALE > told me that I smile much more now than I did in middle school . After consideration I conclude that this is a success ! =] Yay ! 
Research paper is done ! Now for ice cream and Firefly to redeem my soul . =] 
I'm sad to be leaving ... something is either terribly wrong with me or I really do love all the wonderful people here that make up my life . I'm inclined to believe it is the later . =] Thank you , so much . 
Would love to own a bass guitar . =] A bass guitar and a cello . Sounds good to me ! 
Is writing sheet music for Yoder ! Heehee . I realize that I always seem to be volunteering for the orchestra . =] 
... Today will be a very good day . =] Ya Baha'u'l-Abha! 
... God < PROPMALE > me < PROPFEMALE > and honesty and a smile for the days to come . =] Allah'u'Abha , everyone ! Love you all . 
... I want Cloud Strife hair . =] Yf , Buubea . 
And so comes that strange epiphany that things can be both sad and good and make absolutely no sense at all but still be wonderful . Odd world . =] 
... this is for Chass . 
; My name's < PROPFIRST > . I don't have blonde hair , but < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > and I do have something in common . We both log into out facebooks on people's phones and forget to log out ... Herpderp ! ( :D I love you , < PROPFIRST > ! How many people are confused right now ? :3 ) 
Tired . And lot's to do . Oh my ! 
... Standing in the grass watching the storm fly by . Fun ! =] 
... Sigh . Things used to be so simple . I'm gonna go dance now . 
Can't much stand . Let alone clean the house so I can go to Ruhi at three . Someone want to tell me when going to a religious meeting became an earned privilege ? 
... My last week . Yf , buubea ! Off to St. < PROPFIRST > on the 25th . 
Just got done playing wii boxing with the best borther-in-law ever . =] Totally KOed him two for one . That's okay though ... he smoked me at tennis ! 
... Yf , buubea ! Packing today . Not fun . 
... Today ... is a sad day . For me . 
... Packing . And packing . And yelling . And fighting . And I'm really tired of it . Can I skip St. < PROPFIRST > and just start college in Portland ? Yf , buubea . 
... Last day of packing . We leave tomorrow for sure . We'd greatly appreciate any help that we can get ! =] 
... Early start in the morning . I'm really gonna miss these people . Special thanks to those wonderful people who helped us pack . Love you all . =] 
... 120 < PROPMALE > from St. < PROPFIRST > and 250 dollars richer ... How did that happen ? Heehee . =] 
\ ................................... Sleep ............................. \"" 
... Running around St. < PROPFIRST > . Gonna buy < PROPFEMALE > one gigantic toy chest . And survey the shopping . =] I want to find a bookstore ! 
I have a bed ! Huzzah ! Job hunting tomorrow . Hopefully that will help me to fully appreciate all the great shopping here . =] 
... Re-reading all her old books . =] Yesterday it was The Name of the Wind . Today it's Assassin's Apprentice and all its counterparts . XD 
... Illegal immigration . My goodness , I wish people would stop . Immigrants are still people they deserve the < PROPMALE > to make their lives better ! 
About to go find a good Indian restaurant . =] I do love O'Fallon . If only for the food and that fact that my mother is here . Heehee ! 
Playing in the rain anyone ? Geccehk eh dra nyeh yhouha ? \ 
XD 
... Yf , bubbea ! XD About to go to Starbucks and then go find a job . Huzzah ! Coffee . =] 
A note on posture : belly dancing wins . Also , it's inconvenient having a chiropractor as a mother . ^^ ; Amusing though ! 
... Sometimes it's hard to even smile . I'm so very tired right now . All I want to do is sleep . 
I do everything I can for the people I love . It is how I keep them close though they may be , in fact , very far away . 
The Spill Canvas makes my heart happy . =] In in that weird punk rock sort of way . Heehee . 
Ya Baha'u'l-Abha! Big time . =] 
It sucks . When someone you have to be around 24/7 resents your existance . Ugh . I wanna go home ! 
... Debating about a lot of things at the moment . Quite a lot of BIG things . ^^ ; 
Revisiting her past in books . =] There are stories that I believe I will always love . 
Finally got my AP scores . FINALLY ! Not too bad all things considered . I'm an awful test taker , for instance . ^^ ; 
... Can I go another year without my cello ? More than anything else in this world it is my music that I miss . =[ 
... Hm . It's a nice day out . As in it's less than ninty degrees outside . Though it looks like it may rain soon . I'm gonna go read outside . =] Mother supplies me with interesting books . More so than the St. < PROPFIRST > County Library . =P [ Though , I finally got I am Legend ! ] 
... We were made to go together , like coffee and cocolate . But I get to be chocolate so meh ! =P 
.... Has been reading Rurouni Kenshin all day . Huzzah ! =] Also , I MISS < PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > and Chass ! And my family ! 
Sitting outside in the heat and humidity , listening to Coldplay and contemplating the immediate future . Hm . ^^ ; 
I really wish I was still in Indiana . Next year I can go where ever , but now ... I just wanna be with all the people I love . I miss you all , so much ! 
I have a feeing that once I have a vehicle , I will be spending all of my time at the library and only coming home to SLEEP . If that's possible here . 
Got her copy of Baha'u'llah and the New < PROPFEMALE > today . =] The first book I ever read on the Faith and I finally get to finish it . Huzzah ! =] 
I have school tomorrow .... ^^ ; On the plus side , I should only have class from 720 to 1220 . Thank God . =] 
School here just makes me want to go back to Richmond ... It's not so great as I thought and now I just MISS everyone . ^^ ; Love you guys . 
Today is a cleaning and homework type day . XD Also , my Mother is totally awesome . =] And not just because she left me watermelon ! Heehee . =] 
I love ecology . So I've rediscovered . =] Also , first row in choir , AGAIN . Blah ! Though I'm singing first alto this time instead of second . Statistics is confusing me because I'm still trying to pretend that I'm actually in Calculus . I'm probably gonna dig out Mom's guitar here soon and try and retrain my hands , since I don't have a cello . Yf , buubea ! ^^ ;\ 
Other than that . Life is pretty good here . <3 
So , I do not CARE what anyone else has to say on the subject , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Eversole is the most amazing person I have ever met . =] Without a doubt . Also , the guitar and it's chords allude my cello trained hands . ^^ ; Love you , Chass . =] 
Interview\ 
on Wednesday . =] Also , I really do wish I could live on my own . Two\ 
weeks to myself is so GREAT ! Granted I do miss my Mother . But she's a grad student , since when do I get to see her anyways ? ^^ ; Love you , \ 
Madre . Come home soon . =] Blah ! 
Huzzah ! For < PROPMALE > ! Oh my God , I never thought I'd say that . =] I'm sorry I'm such a crazy inexperienced driver who leaves her lights on . ^^ ; To Madre as well . 
Huzzah ! Again . =] So I learned today that the Band Instructor here wants a string bassist , this of course means I must remember how to play bass ( < PROPFIRST > ! Help ! ) , but it means I get to play a STRING INSTRUMENT ! =] Also , my AP Biology teacher is utterly awesome . He's gonna set me up with a mentor for undergrad research at the University of Missouri . Second interview at St. < PROPFIRST > Bread on Friday . =] Love you guys . =] 
Fridays are ALWAYS good days . =] Huzzah ! AGAIN ! I got the job . =] Also , I got to play my bass today . And then discuss that cello rosin is NOT being good for said bass . ^^ ; But I get to play . =] Interesting thing is , I get to play as part of the BAND . God has His funny moments . ^^ ; 
Zombies ! =] I REALLY wanna play some Left 4 Dead 2 , right about now . Too bad I own a playstation and not an xbox . Yf , bubbea ! Oh well , time to go finish my Stat homework , I suppose . And study for the ACT . XP 
I have a feeling that time is gonna start flying by . It's IS already . If I get caught up in work and school , just remind me to tell you that I love you . =] 
Dear God . Thank You , for unanswered prayers . =] Love , < PROPFIRST > . Also , thank You for Mom and Aeryk , who keep me in one piece . Allah'u'Abha! 
Vegetarian from this day forth . Ugh . The fact that my health is limited from FOUR generations before me is irritating . No meat . At all . Ick . 
Writing her application essay for Purdue University . ^^ ; College of Science , of course . =] 
Thank God . =] Not for anything in particular but for EVERYTHING in particular . And especially for the people that keep you in one piece . =] 
White Chocolate Peppermint Mocha and the sunrise over the Missouri River this morning . =] Panera Bread Co . Orrientation is next . This should be a great day ! 
Perhaps some things are difficult but that's how my life should be . How else would I ever grow ? I've had two awful years of life and now I'm doing my best to make sure that everyone knows that I may be plain and I may be poor but I am gonna be the best damn professor you have ever met . =] 
Watching Advent Children , < PROPMALE > enters , que fangirl squeal ! =] 
Watching Pokemon ! =] In honor of < PROPFIRST > McGavin < PROPMALE > . Because I love him more and he refuses to accept defeat . 
Work !... Bleh . But first I'm gonna go shoot stuff . [ On the PS that is ] Dirge of Cerberus ! =] 
It's beginning . I'm gonna be so busy that I'm not gonna have time for ANYTHING ! Remind me that I love you guys , okay ? Especially the people here that keep me from going insane . =] <3 
Goodnight , world . Please do not blow up or disappear as I sleep . Thank you . ^^ ; Also , smile more often . 
I never know what to say when people ask me about the Faith . How do you describe the warmth in your heart ? The peace in your soul ? It would be like trying to describe love . =] 
I need a good song for a Belly Dance/HipHop routine . Any suggestions ? It's not completely necessary that it be Eastern . Though it would be best . ^^ ; 
I am so silly . So very , very silly . XD 
My sisters are visiting . =] They'd better stay a little while ! <3 
Dear God , Thank You for my family . Love , < PROPFIRST > . =] 
Dear God , Thank You for < PROPFIRST > who always keeps me in one piece , for < PROPMALE > who texts me everyday and let's me know that SOMEONE is thinking about me , and Thank You for < PROPMALE > who makes me laugh in third period when I wanna kill something . =] Love < PROPFIRST > . 
Anyone wish to join me in dressing like a zombie on Sunday and walking around the mall ? =] We should go out to eat as well . People in Indiana . You have a FOUR day weekend , come visit me ! XD 
I realize that I love a lot of people with all my heart . I'm very happy and very blessed . =] <3 
Dear God . Thank you for < PROPFIRST > and Yosi , < PROPMALE > and Aeryk , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > , Aly , Roshni , < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > , Stephi , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , Chass , D'Asia , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPMALE > , and my family , of course . =] That's a lot of names . I realize that there are probably even more . Anyhows , I love you all . XDDDDD 
I'm the bassist . If I weren't here , you'd notice . XD 
Playing guitar . =] It's always good to have music in the morning . =] 
< PROPFIRST > McGavin < PROPMALE > , won't you marry me ? =] Pretty please ! XD 
Maybe I should go gluten free too . Gluten free and vegetarian ? Guess I can't eat at work anymore . ^^ ; 
Yf buubea ! XD 
I realize that the only reason I have this job is to pay for my cello , which I will hopefully find soon . I've been to two different stores and they haven't shown me a cello I would be willing to \rent to own . \ " Off to St. < PROPFIRST>'s in the morning for the third shot ! Wish me luck . =] " 
Netflix . =] Just made my day . I WISH they did video games though . That would be AWESOMESAUCE ! XD 
Homework . Life planning . Cleaning . Daydreaming . All of the above today . ^^ ; 
Eighteen in less than 48 hours ? The crap ? 
I have to go to school in the morning , get out early since it's a half-day . Go to the DMV , Bank of < PROPFEMALE > , and the Post Office , for my passport forms , and then to work . ^^ ; Anyone feel like joining me for lunch somewhere in there ? 
Eighteen . Thank you , God . I'm glad I've made it this far . I'm thankful for who I am . I'm thankful for the wonderful friends and family I am blessed with . But I am most thankful for my Mother . Without her I never could have become the person I am . So much of me is a piece of her . And I love her with all my heart . So , thank you . for my Mother , most of all . Love , < PROPFEMALE > . <3 
Dear , God . Thank you for giving me a future that will make me the best person possible . Love , < PROPFIRST > . 
Today is one of those days where everything is falling out from beneath my feet . And not in a good way . I'm so ... frightened . Hopefully the Chamomile tea will help . 
Scratch that . I just found out . I got accepted to Purdue University . =DDD I am SO excited . You have NO idea ! =] 
The snow makes my heart lift . =] Life is such a beautiful thing . 
Mistral , \Repth ! I just healed you !! =] Now give me all your rare items !! NYAHH ! \"" 
Yay ! Snow ! =] 
Punk Goes Acoustic anyone ? XD 
I want a boyfriend like L ! Pretty please ! XD 
NO ! He died ! Gah ... Grr ... the hell ... poo ! DAMN YOU , LIGHT YAGAMI ! You caused my favorite character to die ! You big , smart , manipulative , poop-face !!... Jerk . 
I love unplugged songs . =] Live and acoustic songs make me super happy . 
Sometimes , I seriously begin to consider being vegan . But there's so much I would have to pay such close attention to that I just don't have time for ! ^^ ; Yf , buubea ! 
Woke up singing Blue Skies . =] I have no idea what's wrong with me but now I really wanna learn the bass line for that song . 
Car's fixed . =] 
Going to go find some lemon tea and possibly a nice new hoodie . [ Consonance ] =] I know . I'm lame . I don't get to blow all my check . Besides , we found out last week that saving money is entirely necessary . And yes , I must identify when alliteration is present . It's an AP Lit habit . XD 
I feel very silly but all together today was more than wonderful . I missed you all so much . =] 
I am very blessed . Dispite hardships and tests I realize that I could never have a better life than the one I have . Thank You . Thank you . 
Gonna go shovel my car out of the snow . ^^ ; Awkward wording . Then I have work at three . Tomorrow should be much more satisfying . I have a LOT to do . =] Plus , soccer season starts soon ... the workouts on that paper were ... poo . I'm gonna go swimming . XD 
It's strange since I've left Indiana I've had an increasing interest in football ... and not the European kind . Wow . What's with that ?! Must just be because I wanna see the Colts lose horribly to the Bears . It'll happen . Just wait and see . XD 
So ... Is there a way to turn down the volume on a Wii remote ? Not the TV but the actual controler . I tried and failed . ^^ ; 
Belly dancing anyone ? XD 
Today is the birthday of someone completely wonderful and amazing , my best friend , who's SOMEWHERE on the West Coast . I wish I could be there with him . Happy Birthday , Aeryk . =D 
Huzzah ! Best birthday present ever , and it's not even for me . =] 
Super excited about everything ! Yay ! Now I just need to write this paper . ^^ ; 
Hey ! < PROPMALE > Dunn ! Smile . =] <3 
Normally , I have great respect for professionals and scientists . I plan on joining their world one day . And I'm sorry but ... what the hell is an Ophiuchus ? What is that ?! No . Forget your research . I'm a Sagittarius and you know what that means ? I'm about to bite your head off now leave my zodiac alone ! XP 
So on days like these I always tend to park as far away from the store as possible . I enjoy just walking in the sunshine . =] 
I really , really want to scream . 
Wow , stupid . Lock yourself out of your car why don't you . ^^ ; 
Chamomile tea . Insomnia is over . Today was wonderful .... Today starting at 05:15 yesterday . Some tears but altogether wonderful . =] Goodnight . 
Belly dancing ? I'd love to . I just need to go find a coin belt . ^^ ; Heehee . 
Sometimes I think that me and my fellow Sagittarious women are the reason men complain about women being difficult . XD 
Go to your profile . The first five friends in the sidebar are your team for the Zombie Apocalypse . How screwed are you ? \ 
\ 
Aeryk < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > McGavin < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > Eversole , < PROPFEMALE > Rutherford , and < PROPFIRST > Day . \ 
Haha ! Well , everyone else go home cause the six of us are gonna kick so much ass . XD 
Off to UMSL today for the JSEHS . Then to Portland on Sunday . I'm so giggley . =] Granted I would rather be laying in the sunshine then on this bus . 
Two days . =] I'm traveling from home to home ! 
To my beloved intuituon . I know , I'm stupid . Please , forgive me . I'll remember next time why I don't trust people . Thanks for looking out for me . Love < PROPFIRST > . 
I just have days where I procrastinate like no other . I'm such a horrible student but I hate learning things just because someone says I should . ^^ ; 
Always doing my best ! XD 
I miss being a thespian . I want < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE > back ! Can I just go back to my old theatre program ? Pretty please ? 
Three weeks to graduation !
