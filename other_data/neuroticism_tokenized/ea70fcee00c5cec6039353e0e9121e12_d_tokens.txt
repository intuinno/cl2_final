Within 7 days God made Water , Land , Day , Night , Animals , Plants and trees , the sky , Humans , seasons , days , years , fruits and vegetables . BUT ON THE 8th DAY , God poured out all his Divine Powers and Energy to create a being whom He had named < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > .

Gonna go to Pennsylvania in a couple hours !! 1 week of awesomeness . :D 
Some people have to grow up and be mature . i'm one of those few who will be immature for my whole lifespan . I , and my others , will be acting like 7 year olds at the age 84 . Wait til you see it . The normal people would be playing Bocce ball , We'd be on El Toro . 
On December 21 , 2012 , when nothing happens , I will find ALL of you who actually believed this and I will bring a chair , place it right in front of you , sit on it , and laugh at you . 
Kids , DON'T wait until the last week of August to do your reports , wait until the first week of September .

Like this Status if you have a Dog . Because you're just that cool . 
176 days of school left . Interesting . 
Am I the only person who isn't nocturnal here ? 
PUMP UP THE JAM !!! 
I LOVE STORMS !!!! I wanna run outside ! :D 
In the time of Chimpanzees I was a monkey . Butane in my veins and I'm out to cut the junkie , with the plastic eyeballs , spray paint the vegetables . Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose . Kill the headlights and put it on Neutral . 
BLOCK PARTY TOMORROW !!! WOOOH !!!! This < PROPFIRST>'s my 10th straight year . The Terrace Place Block Party is Legendary . 
Hehe , I showed my mom all the Symptoms of ADHD from Wikipedia , since I have all of those , and she's in shock . I framed the paper for her to remember this marvelous occasion . 
The block party was beyond epic . One of the higlights of the day was when me , < PROPFIRST > , and Kyrsten went tea tasting . < PROPFIRST > quit after 1-2 cup . Kyrsten and I drank every tea . They all tasted so very terrible . 
If I can't focus in School tomorrow , I'm going to blame the insane amount of partying I did yesterday ... And all that Tea too . 
My name is < PROPFIRST > . Nice to meet you . How are you ? That's a phrase I will never say in my life for I do not know the meaning of maturity yet . I think it's a fruit . Possibly Scottish . 
I'm bored . I shall play on my invisible Drum Set . 
is eating mini Apple Pie Bites . 
My classmates were wondering why I have more muscle on my right arm , and left arm looks like a twig . I have a reasonable answer for that . I usually practice Drumming daily , and when I get REALLY into it , I start having spaz attacks and doing Drum Solos everywhere , I lead with my right hand . I get a < PROPMALE > workout from hitting random stuff . 
I'm motivated , YEAH YEAH !!! I'm gonna do what I can cause , I'm motivated , YEAH YEAH !!! I'M MOTIVATED TO LEARN ! I love songs like these . Brings out the inner child . 
You have epic lungs if you're able to say the Our Father in one breath without rushing . HUZZAH !! 
For some reason I'm still always happy whenever I get yelled at , even if the person yelling at me is ready to hit me with an iron golf club . There's something in my brain that tells me it's no big deal . My favorite part is when they're all mad and they're face is red , and I'm just goofing off in the background talking gibberish , my native Language . 
This afternoon , my level of laziness has evolved . It takes too much work to get my mouth to talk , so I just mumble and slur my words . 
Like this Status and I'll write a poem for you . 
Did you know happy people will live longer than those who are serious or hateful , etc . The reason being is because when you're either mad , doubtful , and stuff like that , your blood pressure rises , and when you're older could lead to some not so nice things happening to you . Mentally , and emotionally , I will forever be a 7 year old . :D 
I hadn't heard any new Nickelback songs lately . Rockstar's still my favorite song , though . :D 
It's so nice to see New Jersey's skies clear again . :) 
I've just discovered that Belleville has a Recording Studio . YAYYYYYY !!!!!!!!!!! I always wanted to cover Pants on the ground . 
I hate perfectionists so much . Every little thing has to be perfect and precise with them . Pssh !!! Be non-perfectionist , it's funner . :D 
IS HAVING AN INSULT CONTEST WITH < PROPFEMALE > Rodrigues , WHILE < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Baybiie IS JUST WATCHING .

THIS IS THE TIME OF DAY ALL SCHOOL STUDENTS FEAR MOST ..... SUNDAY NIGHT :O 
Twilight is the most ridiculous movie I have ever saw . The ending , mostly . < PROPFEMALE > has like a lip seizure when talking to < PROPFIRST > . E-E-E-E-ED-W-W-W-WARD . Oh , and < PROPMALE > looks like someone who's at the wrong tribal village . The dancing with a cast part was really interesting . If she tripped .... GOODBYE . and < PROPFIRST > IS NOT A VAMPIRE . His skin glows and he lives in the < PROPMALE > . HE'S A < PROPFEMALE > , DAMN IT !!! 
3 DAY WEEKEND ! YAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This week was so slow . Had to make it pass quickly by getting in trouble with my Accomplice who shall not be named . 
I love insane people . They make the world go round , No ? 
According to iTunes : Nickelback- Rockstar . Played : 94 times . 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY < PROPFIRST > LENNON !!! SAY HI TO < PROPFEMALE > FOR ME !!!! R.I.P. <3 :) 
SOAP GOT IN MY EYES .... TWICE !!! :'( But we gotta enjoy life , think positively . Now my eyes are nice and clean . 
Like this Status if I had ever made you laugh or smile at least once . :) 
Right when school ended , I got in trouble for something I was not even involved in . So when the Toner in the copier is suddenly missing , am I suspect #1 ? How about when someone loses their lunch box ? Maybe when Train A doesn't go faster than Train B , I'll be blamed for that too ? Jesus is on my side , haters . 
Mr. < PROPMALE > Springsteen keeps telling me that I was Born To Run . I went outside running , when I discovered how cold it was , I ran back inside . I was Born To Sit Down . People shouldn't take songs literally now .... I've learned my lesson . 
I'm getting tired of school . Teachers are just cleverly recycling things we learned as kids . Math could go crawl in a ditch and die . 
I'm quite bored ... Like this and I'll write you a random poem ? 
THIS MORNING , we had a fire drill , while we were outside we saw this Bumble < PROPFEMALE > . I was just standing there watcing the guys talk about stepping on it . When we were going back in , Anders stepped on it , then a lower grade teacher told our teacher . Just because we do stupid things automatically means I was involved . Once again , SUSPECT #1 . Two could play at this game . 
Don't deny that you're reading this . Yeah , I see you . 
EFFECTS OF EATING COOKIE CRISPS : LEAVING SCRAPES ON THE ROOF OF YOUR MOUTH AND LIPS . OTHER EFFECTS INCLUDED STUPITIDY , RANDOM YELLING , BREAKDANCING IN SERIOUS SITUATIONS AND THE URGE TO SAY < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > JOKES . CALL A DOCTOR IF YOU START HAVING INTERESTS IN SOAP OPERAS , FOR THIS MAY LEAD TO A MORE SERIOUS DISEASE . 
My mom's afraid I'm going to die doing something stupid . I agree . 
People think of me as lazy . Do you know how much effort I have to put into typing this Status ? Be grateful . 
You're calling me old ?!?, YOUR PARENTS PROBABLY HAD THEIR YEARBOOK SIGNED BY JESUS !!! 
Most of my haters are above the age of 20 . THIS IS FANTASTIC !!!! 
Me + < PROPFIRST > De Castro = All hell broken loose ... 
Who's happy ? ME ! :D 
I was walking up Midland Ave . this lovely morning to go to school , and what do I see on my left ? A girl in short shorts ...... WHO WEARS SHORT SHORTS IN LIKE 40-50 DEGREE WEATHER ?! I didn't know Hypothermia's the new thing now . My bad . 
The Ring ceremony was quite dandy if I do say so myself . I think I broke a record for most pictures taken with me eating cake in the background . 
Had a dream that he was in this mystical < PROPMALE > . Once I came out , I found out that I was in China ..... Then I got transported to this desert riding a Jeep . I made a stop at a local store to buy some Pop-Tarts . They only sold one per packet ...... 
People are always baffled by my variety of knowledge , and then they say to me , \WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER TELL US ?!? \ " I reply \ " You didn't ask . \ " Their faces are priceless . " 
< PROPFIRST > Andrade , < PROPFEMALE > Kilduff , < PROPFIRST > Jerkin ' Manzano , < PROPFEMALE > Fernandes , < PROPFIRST > Bowen , < PROPFIRST > Novis , ........ GOOD MORNING TO ALL OF YOU !!!!!!! :D Have a lovely day . :) 
I have affected my friends with a very dangerous disease ...... Stupidity . It's amazing how fast it catches on . :O 
Tomorrow school begins ...... UGH . Gotta think what antics I'm gonna do this week . I'll need a pair of skiis and grape jelly . 
I am so tired I am about to collapse and just sleep on the floor . I'm not picky . 
Telling me to pick up something is the equivalent of telling me to run a mile , I will do neither . 
PEOPLE SHOULD JUST GROW UP AND MATURE !! Just kidding , who does that ? There is no limit on what you can and can't be , and right now I'm a rhino snorkeling in the Great Barrier Reef . 
So the Retreat is tomorrow ..... I swear , if we don't sing The Lion Sleeps Tonight , Hell will unleash . :D 
I'm quite forgetful . The other day I spent about 30 minutes looking for my other Drum stick , until I realized it was in my hand . Oh , silly me . :D 
HAPPY HALLOWEEN !!!!!! YAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :D 
Today was quite an awesome day . :D 
WHO NEEDS BOOKS TO STUDY ?!? PSSH !! I got the History , Discovery , and Travel Channels on my side , haters . 
Believes that he should be cloned before he dies so he could show his Great Great Great Great Great Great Grandkids how to party like it's 2005 . 
DOESN'T WANT TO DO C O-O PS TOMORROW !! WAAAAAAAAHHHHH !!!!!!!!!!! 
Believes that Humans are capable of flying . 
ALRIGHT , THE C O-O PS ARE TODAY !! LET'S DO THIS !!! I'M NOT SCARED OF MULTIPLE SHEETS OF PAPER WITH QUESTIONS ON THEM !!!!! 
Is attempting to read a book . WHO KNEW GREEN EGGS AND HAM WAS SO LONG ?!? 
My Immune System is so godly !! Yesterday , I got tremendously sick in the afternoon , but in less than 24 hours , I'm back to normal ! Instead of Antibodies , I have < PROPMALE > Norrises fighting off the sickness . Thank you . 
Megamind was the most amazing movie I have seen for such a long time . Right when I heard that first note to Welcome to the Jungle , SERIOUS STUFF WAS ABOUT TO GO DOWN . :O 
MY GRANDMOTHER HAS NOT STOPPED TALKING/COMPLAINING/ARGUING SINCE 8 IN THE MORNING . Instead of sending murderers to Jail , send them to my Grandma , they will MOST DEFINITELY regret their actions . 
Is baking a cake because he is SO hardcore . :D 
THANK GOD IT IS FRIDAY !!!! God decided to slow down the week for us as revenge for telling < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > jokes ... 
THE WEATHER IS SO HAPPY TODAY !!!!! :D 
Is going to attempt the assigment that has a hatred towards him . If I'm not in school tomorrow , I most likely broke my leg from kicking the wall from impatience . HOW COULD THINGS SO VERY < PROPFEMALE > BE SO VERY EVIL ?!? God : 873 , Julio : -49 
Although I am tall in the US , in Soviet Russia I am considered a midget . 
ALRIGHT !!! I GOT LIKE A THOUSAND ASSIGNMENTS THAT ARE DUE TOMORROW !! LET'S DO THIS !!!!! I'M MOTIVATED !!!!! 
Tomorrow , multiple teachers are going to be laughed at . :D 
I'm so glad this week has ended . If we get another bloody week full of thousands of assignments , A FORK WILL BE LODGED IN SOMEONE'S ARM . 
The QP games were quite awesome . Our team was so amazing that we sat out on the next round due to overexposure of Awesomeness . 
I FINALLY have the blessed opportunity to see Dark Side of The Rainbow ! Guess who's going to have nightmares tonight ? ME !! :D 
I'm attempting to see how long I could hold my breath . Right now the record is 1:36 . I'm practicing so when NASA sends me on a secret mission , and aliens blow up my ship , I'll survive ! 
In Soviet Russia , you don't fry bacon , BACON FRIES YOU ! 
.... SCHOOL OF ROCK IS GOING TO BE ON IN LIKE 12 MINUTES ..... I'M DOING MY SCIENCE HOMEWORK .... God is testing me , BRING IT ON ! THROW HAIL MY WAY IF YOU HAVE TO !! I WILL PASS YOUR TEST !!!!! 
HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO MY WONDERFUL FRIENDS AND FAMILY !!! :D I'm saying this early just in case I go into some food-induced Coma sometime during the day . :D 
I FEEL LIKE A FAT PIG THAT HAS JUST DEVOURED ANOTHER FAT PIG , WITH SOME ICE CREAM ...... LOVED IT . 
It's amazing how I ate about 6-7 pounds of food yesterday and I barely even gained anything . THERE IS ONLY ONE LOGICAL EXPLANATION FOR THIS . I am related to a tree . 
I feel that today is the day that I will clean the whole house JUST FOR FUN !!! Mommy's going to be proud . :D 
I SWEAR , IF I SEE ONE MORE DAMN TEENAGE GIRL EITHER TEXTING OR TALKING DURING A MOVIE , I WILL TAKE THEIR CELLPHONE , STEP ON IT , AND LIGHT IT ON FIRE , PUT THE FIRE OUT , AND THROW THE ASHES IN THEIR EYES !!!! Other than that , the movie was awesome . :D 
WHY IS TOMORROW MONDAY ?!? I don't want to go back to school !!! That means I have to do 45 minute intervals of doing nothing ...... What Would Jesus Do ? Teleport to his house . 
You get the most insane feeling when you hear Led Zeppelin's \Rock and Roll\ " on the radio while driving in the car . It's like Peanut Butter just discovered Jelly for the first time . " 
I AM SO SUPER DUPER HAPPY THAT THE WEEK ENDED !! Schedule for weekend : Sleep . Morning nap , pre-lunch nap , noon nap , early afternoon nap , late afternoon nap , pre-evening nap , evening nap , late evening nap , then party until another nap is needed . 
Ah , today is my insane Grandmother's 82nd Birthday !! Giving new meaning to insanity since 1928 ! Oak doesn't fall far from Oak Tree . :D 
OH MY GOSH , < PROPMALE > WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY IS ON TONIGHT !!! I feel like the shoe that hit < PROPFIRST > Bush ... VICTORIOUS . My prayers are being answered . Still waiting for < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > to be on Oprah , God . 
The reason < PROPFIRST > Bonham and < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > died was because God wanted drum lessons . 
Alrighty . I see tomorrow is Friday . The day on which we fry . 
The Little Drummer Boy is a LIE ! We watched the Nativity today , AND I DID NOT WHATSOEVER SEE A LITTLE BOY DRUMMING . THE OX AND LAMB DID NOT KEEP TIME EITHER . Who wrote this song ? He and I have to sit down and have a little discussion . This little drummer boy is quite baffled . 
My arm is still super incredibly numb from arm wrestling yesterday at lunch . To be honest , that was the most work I've done all week . Most likely all of December . 
I am so completely depressed . It feels like my life has been sucked away . TOMORROW'S MONDAY . 
If people could tell someone's age by how they act , I'd be a really tall 5 year old . 
Since my family consists of like 86% women , my shampoo options are UNBELIEVABLE . 
YAY !! In 7 days it's Christmas , 6 days Christmas < PROPFEMALE > , 4 days until our break , and one day ' til I start complaining that in 2 days it's Monday . :D 
Alrighty . Bought my Mommy a Christmas gift . The wrapping looks like I was having a seizure while doing it . Christmas spirit !! :D 
I remember there was a day where I just stared at the sun for literally 15 minutes . Nothing happened , really .... Except everything I looked at was purple . I should walk into school tomorrow after staring at the sun for 20 minutes . RAINBOW !!!!! 
YAY , TOMORROW IS CHRISTMAS !!! I'm going to dress up as < PROPFEMALE > with my beard and hat , and wake up my mom . Nothing starts off your Christmas like a Panic Attack . 
< PROPFEMALE > CHRISTMAS !!!!!!!!!!!! 
I was about to say that I wanted it to snow hard so that we wouldn't have to go to school on Monday ..... Until I realized we were on break . I COULD FINALLY HIBERNATE WITHOUT SOMEONE WAKING ME UP !!! Goverment , depriving children of sleep since the 1960s . 
The snow is beyond PO'd . It's trying to assassinate us . 
I'VE GOT BLISTERS ON MY FINGERS !!!! 
And people ask me why I'm insane . My Father is the one yelling at the stereo system trying to match his yell with < PROPFIRST > Lennon's yell . Help ! is the perfect album for your Dad to have a freakout on . :D 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IDEA JUST CAME TO MY MIND ?! I'm going to Pogo stick off a < PROPMALE > , hoping that when I touch the floor , I'll rocket back up even higher . If that doesn't work , see you at < PROPFEMALE > Maass . 
Thank you Jimi Hendrix . Thank you for bloody waking me up at 3:42 in the morning . No , I do not want to stand next to your fire . 
Dear 2010 , \ 
It's been a great year . I've met awesome people and I've experienced amazing events and moments . I am looking forward to 2011 . I am ready for God to give me the key to unleash Hell . The reason for that is because NJ is quite chilly , we need some warmth . Happy New Year's to everybody ! :D \ 
Sincerely , < PROPFIRST > :D 
These people on Jackass are so creative , I cannot even express it in words . 
It'd be so amazing if someone could build a Time Machine . So when we finish eating dinner , we could teleport back to when dinner started and eat again . Now you know not to eat the bread with that fuzzy stuff on it that you thought was cheese .
