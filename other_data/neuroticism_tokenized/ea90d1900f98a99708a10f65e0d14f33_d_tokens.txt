Wow , I realized im hardly on here o.O lol Anyways , facebook is starting to annoy me to the point of wth ? Why ? Cause a few creeps on here keep repeatedly adding me over and over , just simply ridiculous . So I took action and blocked both of their asses . Lets hope it rests at that end . =D 

Ahhhh , Ok , Lately i've been wishing there was a way that i could just teleport anywhere in the world , A few reasons would be that traveling around the world would be amazing , and of course i would make some stops to meet my beloved online friends =D lol 
Heres a random question for any one : If life had a remote , what would you use it for and why ? 
Crazy story for facebook , Today i woke up to a very loud screaming sound , i was wondering what the hell it was and it turned out that there was a chicken in our yard , and the dogs were attacking it o.O well not really attacking , but one of them was kinda biting at its neck . There were holes in the fence , so thats how the chicken got in . We had to put the dogs in the gate and cover the holes with logs . just crazy lol 
Ahhh !! WTH ? Another dog story . They keep digging holes in the yard , and as a result , they killed all 12 of the neighbors chickens o.o . Now we're trying to figure out how we can fix this digging problem , this has just been one hell of a week for slaughtering chickens o.O 
Wow ... I found this article about some crazed twilight chick , im not sure if its true or not , but after i read it , i was speechless . And i do have to say , twilight has got to be the worst vampire fiction ever to be written in the 21st Century . I cannot be any clearer than than that . So , heres the article : http://www.petitionspot.com/petitions/AntiTwilight 
Heres to all Anti- twilight haters .. This has got to be the most amusing video youtube has to offer XD .. Apparently , twilight has brought out the whole emo kid scene , and this not only has proof , any one anti twilight person will end up on the floor laughing uncontrollably , well i did at least lol so heres the video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1glNuQiE77E 
Wow , I'm not sure how I came across this , but its entirely funny and probaby the most random thing you'll ever see involving Hitler and a sock puppet XD http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/267456 
Would like to scream into a pillow right about now . :) 
Is terribly bored , needs a job , and is on the way to collapsing under constant repetiveness due to the lack of life .. In conclusion , i cannot wait to move ! 
Has found her new theme song .. \Everything Sucks\ " by Dope . :) These guys are my new friends <3 " 
I want to scream at the top of my lungs right now . I'm nearly on the end of losing my mind . I will be home alone most of next week so I will be quite depressed . I feel like wearing all black , listening to slipknot and mudvayne full blast and watching a sad dark and depressing movie like The Crow . :) 
Hapiness I cannot Feeeeeeel .. And love to me is so unreaaaaaaal ... :) Who can name this song ? It's so my mood right now . 
I'm so depressed . :( ... I feel like < PROPFEMALE > Lee , and I don't even like evanescene . But I can relate to the song Tourniquet . 
Have you ever felt like breaking down completely and end up wanting to smash or blow up something ? -_- 
Eh , can't sleep .. Maybe it's cause I have a headache .. and want to be cuddled :( 
This may be a bit graphic , but I feel like saying a big F*CK YOU to the world today . :) 
Boys are nothing but secrets and lies , so when you get screwed over , don't be surprised . :) 
Fuuuuuck . I feel like shit once again , these damn lonely moods always sneek up on me -.- 
Found the best group facebook has to offer : R . A . A . P . E . ( Raging Arsewads Against Pathetic Emos ) :)

\blood pigs\ 
Got up at like 8 am and cleaned up the kitchen . Glad i did :) . Yet im really anxious and nervous at the same time what i should do with my life . Its constantly on my mind , theres so much i want to accomplish , im hoping so strongly that i find a way to better myself . 
Gotta love < PROPFEMALE > ! :D 
I know i've said this to a few people many times before , but i will say it again . Aquarius men are simply intolerable beyond the point of tolerance . Period .
