loves her babies . : ) 
is fuckin sick . uhhh 
is sorry for this past week . She wishes it didn't happen this way ... 
hates failure . 
wants to write a song that they can sing to . You can lead the choir and put the hook where it hurts most . 
thinks that it's about time she has some fun . 
used to be content with loneliness because she never though it was worth the risk . 
is still waiting on you . You're changing . She will just wait for you . 
has a long list of things to say but she'll leave it at \You amaze me . \"" 
really wants to play soccer after seeing that video . 
can see now that all of these clouds are following her in her desperate endeavor to find her whoever ; wherever she may be . 
hasn't lost a sister . She has gained a brother . : ) CONRATS < PROPMALE > AND < PROPFEMALE > OBERMILLER ! 
is contemplating another semester of college . Here , at least . This place sucks ! 
thinks that all of the birthday wishes are badass ! She thanks everyone ! But she is still blown away by what happened ... R.I.P Nate 
thinks that all of the birthday wishes are badass ! She thanks everyone ! But she is still blown away by what happened ... R.I.P. < PROPMALE > Gustav Hanisch .

\Goodbyes are meant for lonely people standing in the rain ... And no matter where I go it's always pouring all the same . \"" 
\Let's go raid the city ! \ " \ " Ok ... Let me go put on pants ! \"" 
really doesn't want to be lonely anymore ... 
can see now that all of these clouds are following her in her desperate endeavor to find her whoever - where ever she may be . 
is taking risks because the things that you regret most in life are the risks that you didn't take . Regret nothing . 
\All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend . \ " - Tupac " 
is finally realizing that this is probably never going to happen . But , she should be pretty damn used to things not going her way by now . 
knows that you never meant to do everthing that you put her through . It's okay . She forgives you . Just know that when you see her cry sometimes she's trying to rid the thought of you from her mind . 
is taking risks because the things we regret most in life are the risks that we didn't take . Regret Nothing . 
took that one risk and it blew up in her face . But guess what ! Still not regretting a fuckin thing . : ) 
is thankful for all of the heartbreak in her life . It only makes her stronger . 
got the point that she should leave you alone . But we both know that she's not that strong . She can live without you . But without you , she will be miserable ... At best . 
just found out how much it will cost to get all of her friends into her fight ... $20 a person !!! Fuuucckkkkk . 
never wanted to hit a bitch more . Bring it on , motherfuckers , bring it on . 
could really use somebody - someone like you .

is so bummed that ice cream doesn't even make it better . 
is like holy fuckin shit . I didn't think you could get any hotter . Wow . I was so wrong . 
got motherfuckin played . Again . Girls are fuckin cruel . 
is the nice guy who always finishes last ... 
knows that you haven't ever needed her and that you probably never will ... But maybe , just maybe , you want her . 
has found out that finding love isn't easily done once you have had that taste of perfection . She wishes that she never let you go and she hopes that you know who you are and how she truly feels about you . </3 
can see now that all of these clouds are following her in her desperate endeavor to find her whoever - wherever she may be . 
and this empty space left in the seat to her right where you should be says a lot . Don't let is say \Good bye . \"" 
thinks that it's getting harder to beleive in anything . She just gets lost in all of her selfish thoughts . She wants to know what it would be like to find perfection in her pride - to see nothing in the light . And in the freefall , she will realize that she is better off when she hits the bottom . 
is taking this risk and it's up to you whether she succeeds or fails . Either way , she won't regret it and neither should you . : ) 
is so typically soft , set back and perfectly taught ; tough and learnin’ and so perfectly taught . She is as selfish as selfish comes but you're giving her a run for her money , < PROPFEMALE > . 
is all too fuckin used to it . 
here's a fuckin finger , bitches ! 
is trying to keep her feet on the ground while her head's in the clouds ... 
thought that we could sit around and talk for hours about the things she couldn't say to you and the things that we could never do . She'll be okay . Is that what you want her to say ? 
is in desperate need of someone that can put her hair in corn rows . Any suggestions ? 
is taking risks because the things you regret most in life are the risks that you didn't take . But she actually thinks this one might work out . : ) 
is saying \Awwww yeah . \ " She had a fantastic night even though that movie was so fucked that she might have nighmares . : ) " 
thinks that the best part is seeing you smile . : ) 
has had pretty much the best week ever . Winning the fight wasnt even the best part . : ) 
You know I need you just like you need me . Can't stop . Won't Stop . I must be dreaming . 
loves making you smile . : ) 
\She thinks I'm crazy judging by the faces that she's making . And I think she's pretty but pretty is just part of the things she does that amaze me . \""

has two new addictions . <3 
really wishes that she wouldn't get hurt so bad so much ... She wishes that just one girl out there wants to be her everything and not just friends . And she wished that girls really meant what they said and that they wouldn't play her . The clouds really are following her ... </3 
thinks you love her and she is really not sure why you do . I fucked up huge and there is nothing I can do to fix it . Maybe she shouldn't have got involved to begin with . But i take comfort in my many words of wisdom and this quote is one of my favorites : \What is meant to be will always find a way . \ " </3 " 
just wants you back . </3 
thinks that playing football with funny people is always good time . Thanks friends ! : )

I thought I could live in your arms and spend every moment I had with you . Stay up all night with the stars . Confess all the faith that I had in you . Too late I'm sure And lonely . Another night , another dream , wasted on you . </3 
I thought with a month apart , together would find us an opening and moonlight would provide the spark and that I would stumble across the key or break down the door to your heart . Forever could see us - not you and me - and you'd help me out of the dark and I'd give my heart as an offering . </3

always knew that she had incredible friends , but now she knows that they are the best friends anyone could ask for . I love you guys . : ) 
And all these Tallahassee skylines - they keep singing out a song . And know it's your song they've been singing all night long .

And you'd whisper in my ears - you'd say \I missed you baby . \ " So sing it over again and over again and over again . " 
was thinkin and she realized that she didn't now if she should have a dog on a chokechain or if she should be the one on the chokechain ...? Because after all , she is < PROPFIRST > FUCKIN STOBBE , BITCH .

17 1/2 you just had to be difficult , didn't you ? lol . you are one incredible man and i enjoyed growing up with you . we did fight plenty , but through it all , you always managed to make me laugh and that's what i needed . it helped me through a lot . but i want you to know that i think very highly of you and i am proud of all that you have accomplished and you will always be my < PROPMALE > and the one and only k-dub .
