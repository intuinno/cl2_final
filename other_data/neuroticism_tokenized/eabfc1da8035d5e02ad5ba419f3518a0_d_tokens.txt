What the hell is wrong with all of my friends ?!?! Getting married and having babies already ?!?! What the ffuuu ...!!!! 
Broken foot ?! Maybe . I went to Warped Tour yesterday , went crowd surfing , got dropped 3 times and now my foot and ankle are swollen and I can barely walk . I was fine after I went crowd surfing and maybe an hour later is when my ankle started to hurt . So I'm going to the hospital later today to have it checked out . I regret nothing ! It was all worth it !! Hahaha !!! 
My foot is fine . 
So , awesome new everyone . I finally got a job ! I am going to be working as a Screamster at Cedar Point !! So I am going to be doing what I do best ( which is scaring people ) and I will be getting paid to do it ! 
I checked my email and I got one from Cedar Point and it told me more information about my job and at the end of the email it said that it was recommended that I watch some horror movies so I can devlop a character . Do you guys really think I ( of all people ) need to do that ? 
I went to bed around 3:00 or 4:00 am last night and didn't get up until 3:00 pm . Apparently I was in cat mode or something . I can't believe I slept for almost 12 hours . 
So I HATE it when you invite someone to an event and for whatever reason , they just can't attend so they feel they just have to tell you why . WHO CARES ??!! I know I don't , so STOP telling me why !!! 
I'm 3 weeks and I'm craving gummy bears ! 
I HATE it when someone asks me if I am mad at them . If I was mad at you , you would know !!!! If you truely know me , you would know this information . If you don't know this information , don't talk to me . D:<

When you say poop , your butthole makes that same shape as your mouth when you do poop . Same can be said for explosive diarrea . :3 
Well , I'm off for costume fitting and job training ! 
Oh my God !! After my training today , I am even more excited about working !!! I can't wait to start !!!! 
Off to Cedar Point !!! Woooooo !!!! 
Just got back from work , will be home until Thursday , then it's back to Cedar Point to scare the pee out of people . I had some amazing scares . If you want to hear about them , come over ! 
I will be playing Gears Of War 3 in less then 24 hours . * serious face * 
Well , I have my Gears Of War 3 and everything EXCEPT my Retro Lancer . That apparently will be shipped next Monday . And I am cool with that . The only thing that sucks , is I think I am coming down with a cold or something because I am feeling a little under the weather . So I am going to lay down , all snuggled in my bed , and watch some DragonBall Z ! :D 
Everyone come visit me at work so I can scare you !! Fridays are 6:00 pm to midnight , Saturdays are from noon to midnight , and Sundays are noon to 9:00 pm !
