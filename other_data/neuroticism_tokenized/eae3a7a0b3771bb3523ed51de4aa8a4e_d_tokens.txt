Is wondering about the path of least resistance . Is it possible that it can be fullfilling ? 

Having a glass of wine and wondering if 30 days are up yet ! 
Having a very hard time getting motivated and working on my goals for the year ! 
I now have short dark hair and somehow I don't feel any different . I guess it really is what's on the inside that counts . Of course it is !!! :) 
Is going to listen to some Breaking < PROPMALE > . Goodnight you guys 
I love it when he tells me to listen to this new song and it turns out to be this new band I LOVE !! Music makes the world go round !! 
Today is my baby girls 10th birthday , she is the most amazing creature I have erver seen ! Happy Birthday < PROPFEMALE > 
Has anybody here tried Medifast ? Like ? Dislike ? Opinions wanted . Thank you 
A true friend doesn't care if your house is untidy , your car makes funny noises , if you only have $5.00 in the bank this week , or that your family is not perfect ... they love you for who you are . True friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question their friendship . REPOST if you are lucky enough ... 
Life has a funny way of reminding me just when I think I have all the answers that I have no idea . I am just along for the ride . 
I had the most amazing day-had some much needed time with a couple of old friends and a new one as well . Life is good ! Thank you < PROPFEMALE > , we always have so much fun just giggling like a couple of school girls ;-) 
Wine and then bed-goodnight 
I have had a lot of problems wiht my FB ever since I added Mobsters . 
I am so excited , my < PROPFEMALE > is coming to visit me ! One of my bestfriends and we have never met . I can't wait , we are gonna have some \FUN \"!" 
When all else fails : CHOCOLATE ! 
It is supposed to reach 70 today-woo hoo ! 
I work with the best people , they can make me laugh out loud even when I am irritable :) 
COFFEE !! 
Is not sure if I am too stupid to figure out Mobsters or if I just don't care :-/ 
Wow , is it really only Tuesday . my brain is fried already and I stayed home yesterday with < PROPFEMALE > . Wonder what the rest of the week will bring 
I wish I could say I love to work out but I don't! I walked 4 < PROPMALE > yesterday and man my butt hurts , yay :-) 
Wow , People are STRANGE ! Just sayin 
Just got back from seeing Letter's to < PROPFEMALE > - Great movie !! I have had a great weekend with my dear friend < PROPFEMALE > who is visiting from Ohio . Shopping , Oregon coast , puking man in bar and lot's of rain :) 
Love is ... when he says \may I have this dance ? \ " and she starts crying like a baby " 
The rain is making me and others cranky-here's hoping today is better :) 
Today is one of those day when I remember that everything happens for a reason and I wouldn't change a thing . I am where I should be and have been blessed with the most amazing daughter and a pretty amazing boyfriend too . I do miss my angel 
\Fireproof \"" 
Happy Father's Day to all you dads ! I am thankfull for the amazing men in my life , the dads and granddads and my sweet sweet < PROPMALE > !!! 
Happy my baby girl is home sleeping in her bed tonight . I missed her so much ! 
Just one of them days 
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ... Please remember only two defining forces have\ 
ever offered to die for you ... JESUS CHRIST and the AMERICAN SOLIDER . \ 
One died for your soul , the other for your freedom . If you agree ... copy\ 
and paste in your status ... GOD BLESS THE USA !!!!! Happy Fourth . 
Because 11 years ago today two strangers drank too much and used very poor judgement I now have the most amazing little girl in the world-you never know when your bad judgement will turrn into one of Gods blessings so all I can say is \don't drink and drive \"" 
Thank you all for the birthday wishes , you all helped make it a very nice day ! 
Second < PROPMALE > s : we all get them at some point in our lives , what we do with them is entirely up to us . I thank God for giving me a second < PROPMALE > with the love of my life and I am so happy he is still with us this year ! 
Oil change : $30 , Gas : $150 , Accommodations at the Pennington's for the week : free-Getting the hell out of dodge for a week : Priceless 
Made it home from Boise yesterday but got rear ended on 205 , of course . I hate that stretch of road . Good to be home as much as I miss our good friends already . It's nice to have a home away from home where your good friends are more like family ! 
Dinner with < PROPMALE>'s parents- I always leave their home feeling at peace . Two of my favorite people in the world ! -Blessed :-) 
This back and neck pain is for the birds- I'm tired of it already ! Makes one feel so old 
The insanity of life popped it's head up in many different forms today-Not superstitious but what a really WEIRD Friday the 13th !! 
I so very blessed- I wouldn't trade my difficult journey for anything in the world 
One of the best lessons my mom taught me is that living well is the best revenge . Words to live by ! 
If you believe in God , repost this . Please don't ignore . You are being tested . For it\ 
says in the Bible , \Deny me in front of everyone and I will deny you in\ 
OK < PROPFIRST > , I'm not dead yet so that's a good sign ... not easy stuff but that's what I want . I will keep you posted ... 
Just me and stinky tonight and how I love stinky 
back to work after a relaxing yet productive 4 day weekend ... now come on Friday 
It is important to keep an open heart and an open mind ... you never know when someone special will find their way in . 
I absolutely adore this show \Plane Jane \"" 
I love < PROPFEMALE > because she will come back to bite you in the A@# when you least expect it- Do unto others ! 
Beware of the wolf in sheeps clothing 
Went to meet < PROPFEMALE>'s new teacher last night , she said she was so happy to see her in her class because < PROPFEMALE > is always such a < PROPFIRST > of sunshine . That's our girl- she always makes me feel so proud and so blessed ! 
What I have learned in the last year is that true love really is kind and patient and with that there is no telling what we can do together ;-) 
Is taking a break to tend to my real life and loves 
I heart < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > ! 
Need to go back on the < PROPMALE > diet- too bad someone can't bottle those can't eat can't sleep feelings you have when you first start falling in love ! 
Goodnight < PROPFEMALE > 
I have always hated how my blonde hair gets all over my black clothes and now it's black hair on my blonde floors ... oh , and i want a puppy . SQUIRREL 
Thinks that people in a position of authority of one kind or another need to set the example for everyone esle ... be smarter and more proffesional but unfortunately people with very poor judgement get those jobs too . 
I have a < PROPFEMALE > laptop and my DVD/CD burner stopped working last week after I tried to burn an encrypted movie- anyone have any ideas on how to fix it ? I have tried everything I could find online . Looks like I will be buying a new burner soon . 
\Whip It\ " I just wathced over the weekend-great movie ! Instant classic in my book " 
If you have a wonderful man , who helps balance your whole world ... who isn't perfect , but is perfect for you ... who works hard and would do anything for you ... that makes you laugh ... who is your best friend ... who you want to grow old with ... and who you are thankful for ... everyday ... then re-post this . 
Is going for a walk ... so happy to finally be feeling free of back and neck pain . I sure hope it last ! 
Loves it when you are driving and hear that new song on the radio that makes you say \WHOA \"" 
< PROPMALE > Wylde+MyDarkest Days+Ludacris = HOT 
I'M A HANDFUL !!! Unfortunately most women won't repost this . I'm strongwilled , independent , & outspoken , I make mistakes , I am sometimes out of control & at times hard to handle - but if you can't handle me at my worst then you sure don't deserve me at my best .... If you're a ...... HANDFUL ... then repost this on ur stat ...... us ! I dare YOU 
Had a wonderful time catching up with an old friend last night- sometimes you don't realize how much you miss someone until they are standing in front of you again . Alway love hanging with you < PROPFIRST > !! And < PROPMALE > and Darsey and Beck too ;-) 
Anyone have any ideas to boost the immune system ? I have tried everything I know and I have been sick every month sine June , twice this month . Tired of being sick !!!! 
I'm feeling absoultely content for the first time in a long while- I see the light at the end of the tunnel and I am looking forward to starting my life with the second sweetest man in the world ! My daddy will always be my first love 
Who thinks FB needs spell check ? 
ALERT ..... there is someone called < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > who is friend requesting kids on facebook at the moment , posing as a 14yr old , when actually he is a 48yrold peadophile . He is known 2 the police . please be aware and tell every one u know . We must keep our kids safe .... please , please ......... copy ...... and paste 
I'm sooo cold , going to bed early so I can cuddle up . BBRRR 
All in all a good day , met a new friend and spent time with an old friend . 
It's\ 
sister week . If you have a sister who has made you laugh , wiped your \ 
tears , hugged you , watched you succeed , watched you stumble , cheered you\ 
on and kept you strong , post this . Sisters are friends forever . Put \ 
this on your status if you have an amazing sis ! :) 
My heart is full and so is my life and tomorrow my belly will be too . What more can you ask for ? Happy Thanksgiving 
I love how the woman who says she is so saddened by others heartlesness tells me today that I'm ugly , wrinkled and look like a witch ! I guess it's a good thing beauty shines from within ! Life is so precious and I am so thankfull for the amazing friends and family who have blessed my life 
What I am most proud of in my life is my daughter and the good job I have done in raising her with the help of her dad and our families . If you have met her even one time you would see that we have done a good job . I curse the woman who would say that I might be a neglectful mother out of spite simply because things haven't gone her way . 
Ok , I have come down off my soap box . I just had to get those things off my chest . For today I have a date with < PROPMALE > , his grandpa and < PROPFEMALE > . I could not ask for a better day ! 
It's a really sad day when you have to pack up your supervisors belongings because her position was eliminated after 21 years of service . I'm going to miss you < PROPFEMALE > , alot ! Welcome to the world of automation 
Went to see Burlesque today , I absolutely loved it ! Definitely worth paying to see in the theater , maybe even twice . It reminded me why I love < PROPFEMALE > and now I love < PROPFEMALE > Aguilera as well ! So much talent on one < PROPFEMALE > stage 
Sometimes timing is everything 
< PROPMALE > tells me I'm his angel in one breath and crazy in the next . I'm his angel on Prozac 
redbull and liquor , just kidding- Redbull redbull 
Where in the world is < PROPFIRST > Baker ? I miss him . I know he is still around these parts cause I've seen the pictures . Where oh where are you Baker ???? 
Being in love isn't always all it's cracked up to be . My co-worker tells me \be right or be happy\ " why can't I be both ? I'm the woman " 
So I decided to try Healthetrim since I have heard so much about it . I am very skeptical about any weightloss supplements . I'm a believer that it takes hard work and a healthy diet . Verdict for me has beent that it makes it a lot easy to eat healthy . My junk food cravings are all but gone . I'm still almost 40 and it is still hard but this stuff is making it easier . To all my struggling friends I would reccomend it . 
The hardest-learned lesson : that people have only their kind of love to give , not our kind . ~ Mignon McLaughlin\ 
Via my dear sweet < PROPFEMALE > 
For the record I have the most awesome and amazing kid in the world !! :-)

2 more days until my < PROPFEMALE > comes home . I am so ready to get a good night sleep again . Miss her so much when she's gone .
