marathon on the square at 10pm for happy hour ? 

is so glad that the fire alarm will save us from excess water vapor . . . from the dryer . grrr . 
The bike home for lunch is rather exhilarating when oversized truck make right turns from the left < PROPFIRST > , without turn signals . At least do it when the light is green maybe ? 
from my vet school app , hours I have spent working & volunteering with animals and veterinarians : 3690 
just got a kitten !!! Any name ideas for the itty bitty < PROPFEMALE > ? 
< PROPFEMALE > thinks my leg is fun to climb up . ow . But it's hard to be mad when the purpose of the climb is to snuggle with me :) 
is kinda glad my front brake is now functional , otherwise I would likely have been squashed by a little yellow car today . 
Finally decided on a new name for < PROPFEMALE > ! Sassafras :) 
sassafras has the sniffles :(
