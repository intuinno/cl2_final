Sitting in the hospital with my pappy , he benn here for 3 days , his heart is failing again .. i pray he'll be allright 

so happy my pappo is home , just got a call going to do photoshoot for my portfolio \ 
.. yaaay !! 
got out of the hospital at about 7:00 last night ! My leg really hurt's!!! i have to see him in court today !! im scared ! 
Fight to STOP Domestic violence !!! 
I'm sick and tired of my family humiliating me and pushing me to the ground ! \ 
I will have respect !! And i Will be treated like the lady that i am ! \ 
And if my family won't respect that , it will be the last time they disrespect me ! \ 
I deserve to be treated with love and respect ! 
people think they are showing concern but all it all deliberate insult and hurt . no care for the injuries inflicted ! 
OMG I'M CANCER FREE !!!! 
I gotta find the line between who I am and who I want to be . I gotta \ 
find the line between < PROPFEMALE > , pride , and living out my dreams . And \ 
whether I wait for my fate unfold , and whether I try , I gotta find the \ 
line . 
I can't seem to find the true heart behind this tragic state of mind \ 
that makes it hurt to breathe . Cuz baby , love's in the air . And I'm \ 
compelled to share these things I feel that make life so surreal , and I \ 
can't just watch you fall asleep . 
Now , if you know you need the love , isn't it worth it all ? Isn't it \ 
worth the < PROPMALE > to just make a difference in someone's life but you ? \ 
And if you know you need the love , isn't it worth the risk of having \ 
your heart ripped and broken into ? Is it worth it to you ? 
Did i deserve it ? did i make him hit me ? 
why do i have to guess how you feel or what your thinking ? please just say something !! \ 
are falling for me ? do you care about me ? i can't go on like this much longer !!
