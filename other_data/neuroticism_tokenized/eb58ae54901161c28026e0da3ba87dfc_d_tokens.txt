when will people wake up to the truth ? 

the energy given by one who takes the time to reccognize a need in others is beautiful and cherished by those who recieve that gift of an understanding word or action . 
my horoscope said this was a day of passion and excitement ... i think the psychic needs to eat his wheaties before making another prediction . 
who the heck would choose \she'll be commin around the mountian when she comes\ " as their wedding reception intro song ? this is a question that has puzzled my people for ages ... " 
through all the positive energy , creativity , and love towards others i put out ... i still seem to hit points of non-productivitiy that seem to always end up effcting others . i wish i understood how to balance the two out , but when i am in productive mode 
LIVE LIVE LIVE ... if you screw things up , live more ! 
Monday night is now my favorite night of the week ... 
ready to write the final chapter and move on to the next universal adventure with my lovely Bride and children ! 
ok ... so when they post the tv listings for shows such as M*A*S*H or Threes Company ... on the cable networks they should not feel a need to put ' re-run ' after them . 
its time to wake up world ! im back ! 
passion is the foundation for all imagination ... imagination is the foundation for all creation , and creation is the reason behind every wonder that sparks the core of the soul . 
ALRIGHT ! why the hell when i look at my ' inbox ' now , all of a sudden i have to see the email's ive SENT ???? i mean i go to my INBOX to see emails that have come to me . NOT to see ones that are SENT ! when will facebook stop changing around every couple fo months ? i am DISLIKING fb more and more as time passes ! 
life is SO exciting ! the world is looking smaller and smaller and the universe is looking bigger and bigger ! who is going to ride with me ! who is going to fly to the farthest reaches of their dreams ?

you have hold the power with in the core of your being to create new worlds , new hope , and brin greater light to this universe through reaching out in love for the greater good of those around you and abroad 
there is so much in the universe to discover and yet love is the most obscure and desired journey and treasure , that we ALL have the power and ability to find and give to one and other , yet so few put aside their selfishness to give it , so they miss the beauty of it when it is infornt of their eyes they are blinded by their own thoughts and ill behavior 
the movie \My Dinner With Andre\ " A MUST MUST SEE ! ... we MUST wake up ! " 
some friends are there for you when you are down , some are there when they want something or when they themselves are down . some are there just to < PROPFEMALE > out and have fun . but true friends are there through it all . true friends are hard to find , and define themselves through the struggles and pain of life rather then when things are easy and happy . when one does find a true friend they are cherrished forever . 
Music is light , transformed into a tangible measurement for the heart to appricate , and bask in its warmth and beauty from with in . 
sometimes life can overwhelm and distort ... but the focus of ones vision must always be the measurement for the reality of thought and feeling 
i hope everyone who is full of light with the purpose of loving others and giving back to the universe , is blessed with such wondeful joy as i have been able to recently experience and will continue to do so throughout . 
i have a vision of you adorned with beauty , every movement of your body generating light , every breath you breathe outward to the world giving off new hope for the future of all beings int he universe ... this is a vision you have inspired by the love you have shared from the depths of your soul . its a vision that has touched the soul of my world , and will touch the whole of the worlds beyond for all time that passes . 
i get to go to alabama today !!!! omg ! ive never been there ... what will it be like ... what kinds of new and exciting creatures will my eyes behold . what will be the experience of my heart upon crossing over the threashhold of the state line . what new worlds will become of the depths of this adventure . only one can wonder , and wonder i will .

Tihs is bcuseae the huamn mnid deos not raed ervey lteter by istlef , but the wrod as a wlohe . If you can raed tihs , psot it to yuor wlal . Olny 55% of plepoe can . 
today im reminded of how everyone who is a true hero to others in some way or another has had their motives questioned at some time or another . 
lifes a garden ... plant what you < PROPFEMALE > to one day blossem into beauty , and then nurture it carefully ... along the way there will be thorns , annoying bugs , and maybe even rodants that try to destroy it and take what isnt theirs , but one day you will look out over it and be filled with warmth and joy at all the wonder that has grown ... 
today , i am more sure about my future then ever before ! peoples lives WILL change and light will adorn those who were once cloked in darkness ... love and passion will overcome fear and self doupt ! 
i feel like some < PROPMALE > healing is taking place in my life right now ! this is amazing . i have not felt this much joy in a very long time ! i am so thankful for those who can reach out and truly put aside their ego to help others ! 
\if you've got more to give then you've got to prove ... put your hands up and i'll follow you \"" 
let your heart speak your answer , let your vision be your guide ... let your words bare your soul , and let your actions resonate forever ! live with TOTAL Passion ... TOTAL energy and FOLLOW your Dream all the way to the outer reaches of time itself ! become the legend you admire most ! and TRULY LIVE a free spirit ! love all of you SO much !!!! 
yesterday i total Miracle occurred for me ... i am still trying to contemplate exactly what happened and how it came about . but i have to believe that one should NEVER give up hope & ALWAYS follow their vision ! even if it doesnt seem possible ! the people & the circumstances WILL enter your life that will allow for you to achieve that which youve envisioned ! you WILL manifest your hearts deepest desires into reality ! 
for those willing to travel beyond the reach and do something as simple as show kindness or as great as give their very life , each is a hero to the one whos heart is forever changed by the encounter . but many fail to witness the beautiful worlds forming around them , simply because of their own selfish lust for security and self importance . 
people who lack compassion for others are ignorant ! DONT YOU DARE talk to me about being \Christ like\ " if you are ignorant of kindness and compassion for others ! YOU FOOL ! " 
its funny how people can CLAIM to want to make a difference , yet never REALLY make any more effort toward reaching out to others then those who just sit and watch the world go around ... and it even bothers me more the ones who claim to be out making a difference yet TOTALLY ignore another's call for help ! WHERE ARE YOU AT REAL ' MOVERS'!!! ??? 
it was suggested i shouldnt post things that might be seen as me talking negatively about people . so i guess im not to post anything bad about BP ? or < PROPFIRST > Bush , or Hitler ? well anyway , i will just say the following ... 
our leaders now have a very clear understanding that human rights mean very little to us as a people , and that we are more interested in restrictions for the purpose of hording what we have , rather than sharing our freedoms with those around us . the rewriting of laws , tampering with the constitution , and creating multiple barriers and checkpoints for the purpose of \our own protection\ " is just the beginning . " 
we as a country are supposed to be a beacon of hope to the rest of the world . NOT keep up with other countries anti-humanitarian methods of immigration enforcement . 
if you support ANYONE who is a high ranking freemason / bonesman , you are supporting and advocating the FULL authority of the Islamic faith and the FULL authority of the Koran . look into the facts . do some REAL historical research . stop following the text books and approved literature propagated by the mainstream bookstores and media . 
live life with passion . and the universe will call back to you through all the voices of those who's lives you touch along the way ! as life bends and molds to that which you have envisioned , beauty will < PROPFEMALE > to every corner of the earth and every < PROPFEMALE > with reflect the light of your truest dreams ! 
so now the republicans want to take away incentive of the teachers and their tenure , based on if a child gets rebellious and decides not to perform ... isnt that TAKING AWAY the responsibility of the parent to properly guide their child and play a roll in how their child responds to the teachers ? !!!!! 
Believing in the truth of perfect beauty and love ... may every heart know kindness and heal in hope of warmth . 
I hope as people are posting funny topics , enjoying and liking their friends posts , and going about life ... that they won't forget those devastated in Japan . 
St Patric ... 
Has a personal reason for ASKING if everyone could please put this as their status for 1 hour . I know the ones that will !! Think of the ones you know or love who has or had cancer .
