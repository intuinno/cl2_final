Dead copperhead on the driveway .... at least it's dead ! 
Frog in the house last night , copperhead in the driveway today ... what will tomorrow bring ? 
I guess we got a respite today ... although < PROPMALE > said he saw a HUGE spider in the house in the corner near the fireplace . Great . Needless to say , he wouldn't go near that part of the room again . He's happy he's not here tonight - and I'm going to be looking over my shoulder the rest of tonight and all day tomorrow , wondering about this little beastie .... 
What a greeting we had last night when < PROPFIRST > and I came back from dinner ! Just as we parked in the driveway , a hawk landed on the front side of our garage , right where we were parking . What a nice sight to see ! 
Yes , my washer is FIXED ! Now on to the mounds of laundry that have piled up waiting for the plumber and washer repair man in the last two weeks .... 
Methinks the laundry pile has taken on rabbit-like qualities .... every time I think I've gotten to the end , more dirty clothes suddenly appear ! 
Studying hard today ! Part 2 of the IRS Special Enrollment Exam to be taken tomorrow morning ! Yikes ! 
Off to rehearsal .... choreography starts tonight ! I'm excited !
