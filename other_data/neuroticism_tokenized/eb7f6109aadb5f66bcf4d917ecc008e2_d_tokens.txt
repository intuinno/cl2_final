is playing the new Red Dead Redemption 
Made a 4.0 this semester ! Take that Mr. President and your list ! 
just finished Red Dead Redemption to 1000 achievements points out of 1000 . I'm awesome . 
wants to go to Amarillo , Texas to take on the 72oz steak Challenge 
Is it sad to say \man I'm glad it's only 97 degrees outside . \ " and mean it ? " 
Sims 3 might be coming to the XBOX 360 what ?! 
is excited about the movie Tron ! 
Rock Band 3 is more of the same with a keyboard attached . Checked off on DO NOT BUY THIS . 
Homefront looks awesome ! I'm glad it's a FPS with all these TPS comming out it's good to see some stand apart . The whole idea that you're NOT a soldier and you're playing a civilian in an occupied US makes it so much more realistic and difficult . I look forward to seeing if this game will include a Legacy control scheme . 
Red Faction : Armageddon looks like the same engine as Red Faction : Guerrilla , not to say that it a bad thing . The premise seems to have shifted a lot from an open world TPS to a closed world Survival Horror TPS . Seems interesting . 
Final Fantasy : The 4 Hereos of Light will the first Final Fantasy at E3 that I am not excited for . Seriously you make the first multiplayer Final Fantasy RPG on the DS with crappy graphics . 
Medal of Honor : Tier One looks almost EXACTLY like Modern Warfare 2 . It seems to me that when Infinity < PROPMALE > moved to EA they helped on Medal of Honor or something because you could have put the title Modern Warfare 3 on it and I would have said \Yes this looks like what I expect to be Modern Warfare 3\ " Everyone who has doubts about Medal of Honor should check this game trailer out . " 
All I have ot say about Crysis 2 is that I thank God that it's not going to be PC only ! Yay for the consoles ! 
Deus Ex : Human Revolution looks like the most visually gaming masterpiece that will come out in the next year or so . It looks so good that it could be a movie and trump Avatar . 
Call of Duty : Black Ops looks exactly how I want it to be , World at War with a setting a bit more modern and high octane scenerios . I wonder if they will include a bonus gameplay like they did with Nazi Zombies . 
F . 3 . A . R looks so awesome it remindes me that i need to beat the Second one . Looks like I've got a used game to add to my Buy list . 
APB Criminal looks like a Punk version of GTAIV , it also seems like there is more custimization for your character . With the dissapointment of GTAIV maybe this will be a relief . 
Why did DJ Hero get a sequal ? Why ? The game was horrible and sold very few coppies . Tell me why I get a sequal to DJ Hero before I get a sequal to Portal . 
Spider-Man : Shattered Dimensions looks like Mirior's Edge , nausiating . 
Civilization V why are you PC only ? I want to play you on my XBOX 360 . 
Mortal Kombat looks gruesome as it plenty well could be . I probably wont get this game due to the fact it's just another fighting game and when you play the best fighting games it's hard to switch . I'm looking at you < PROPFEMALE > Vs . Capcom 3 . 
BTW go Uruguay ! lol
