I wanna tell you something < PROPFIRST > , something you do not yet know , that we K-PAXians have been around long enough to have discovered . The universe will expand , then it will collapse back on itself , then will expand again . It will repeat this process forever . What you don't you know is that when the universe expands again , everything will be as it is now . 

I like it when people stalk me because it makes me feel important . =P

Hear the children crying ( One love)\ 
Hear the children crying ( One heart)\ 
Sayin’ , “Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel all right . \ 
”Sayin’ , “Let’s get together and feel all right . \ 
”Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa 
Don’t worry about a thing\ 
‘Cause ev’ry little thing gonna be alright\ 
Singin’ , “Don’t worry about a thing , \ 
‘Cause ev’ry little thing gonna be alright . ”\ 
Rise up this morning , \ 
Smiled with the rising sun\ 
Three little birds pitch by my doorstep\ 
Singin’ sweet songs of melodies pure and true\ 
Sayin’ , “This is my message to you-u-u . ” 
what would country , rap , techno , and reggae sound like mixed together ? 
These are harder days 
Man is a universe within himself .

Ziggy says hug who you know

My name is now Jean-Claude ! 
does it matter what im talking about ? im just talking ; nothing more than a random conversation between not-so-much friends and more so aqquaintences . does that make any sense at all ?

this is my pretty raygun , i will use my pretty raygun on you . it shoots rainbows and unicorns and chocolate fairies , and hearts and stufffff ... 
i spent five straight hours lastnight and this morning without any breaks drawing a single picture while listening to Shpongle ... and yet im not even a quarter of the way done 
im almost half done with my drawing 
8 Total hours spent on one drawing so far , im determined to finish the whole < PROPFEMALE > . 
10 or 11 hours : 3/4 of the way done . 
Dickfish ... Vaginasalmon ... 
< PROPFEMALE > ! < PROPFEMALE > ! Give me your < PROPFEMALE > ! 
< PROPFIRST > Welch sounds so much better than Korn yet , he's a member of the band :P 
I have come up with a new drawing that I dreamt up . I could just recreate it with a camera - but then I would have to ask Mrs. < PROPMALE > because the location of the nightmare was at school , between A Hall and the Social Studies wing :P Then of course I would need to Photoshop it ; however , I don't have Photoshop . So , instead I'll draw it ; it'll take about a month or so , or ' till 2011 . Either way , I AM going to finish it . 
i skipped school , now im paying the price : my whole weekend :'( 
i faceplanted into a girls chest , twisted my back , and fell on my back all in one game of CTF during PhysEd . 
im tired ... 
i dont have a date to homecoming but im still going just to chill ... or be a friggin maniac . 
there has always been death in life , but what about life in death ? 
i think im having some kind of withdrawal symptoms . but from what ? 
I blacked out in the locker room after gym . 
Come close your eyes at last and wake yourself from evil dreams\ 
Come drown with me in love’s deep and shoreless sea\ 
Together we’ll escape so take my hand and let us fly to Shpongleland\ 
Together we will float away away\ 
Float away 
Mommy loves to work and daddy loves to play\ 
Sometimes daddy got to go far away\ 
I’m too young to go quiet in the night\ 
Try to put me to sleep I’m gonna give it a fight 
finally finished three < PROPFEMALE > essay 
Discard the strain of mortality , reset and display anger sequences\ 
Improve your connectivities , conceived in reverse of your neural patterns of hate

I am the rage and the vile and the voracity . I am the < PROPMALE > and the Fallen . I am the Enemy , I am the Sin and the fear and darkness . I shall never die . The thought of me is forever ; in the bleeding hearts of men , in their vanity and obsecrate and lust . Nothing shall ever destroy me . Nothing ! 
best night in the Summit last night , i think this is what fun feels like . 
i want to punch a building in half :P

Was on a walk at 5:20 am . Palm Bay Police stopped me as I was getting back to the hotel . I was questioned and then they realized they saw me earlier at the church during my grandparents 50th wedding anniversary ; I was carrying up the sacraments with my bro . Let off with warning . Just a misunderstanding . NO POLICE RECORD ! Parents probably will ground me and not listen to what I say ... they never listen . 
stupid phone wont connect ... :( 
ill never stop being tired
