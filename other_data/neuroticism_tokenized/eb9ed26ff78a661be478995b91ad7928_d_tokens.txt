Cleaning night 
Starting the day off with some Colour Revolt 
I'm not sure which of my friends on here started playing snake first , but it started a little chain reaction of people playing snake . Now I continue to lose valuable studying time to snake ... 
Attention , if you are playing snake and your score is around oh , I don't know , 1300+ DO NOT PLUG YOUR CHARGER IN ! It will restart your game . I just wasted over half an hour . 
I love snake 
Raising your voice : the next best thing to being right .

Someone should pay me to do the useless things that I do all day ... because that would make life wonderful . 
Just took a biochem exam ... I get really angry when I check my notes after an exam to find out that I wrote the opposite of what I needed ...
