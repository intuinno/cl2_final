This is very strange ... being the first one up in our house at 9:30 in the morning is not normal . Good thing I know that last night was New Year's < PROPFEMALE > , otherwise I'd probably be freaking out ! \ 
I guess this is what I get for being sick - once I'M all better , everyone else gets to be the lazy bones ... lol jk . I do feel better though , THANK YOU , LORD ! I hate being sick . \ 
Guess I to have a fresh start for the new year :) 

I had lunch with a banana on your car because that's how I roll ! 
A woman's heart should be so hidden in Christ that a man should have to seeek Him FIRST to find her . Just some encouragement for you girls out there . : ) <3 
I'm home this weekend with my wonderful big sister and my beautiful baby niece ! I even get to babysit her today ( which I'm also getting paid for - though that's not why I'm doing it) ! Ah , I love my family !!! 
Yessssss !! It's FINALLY spring break ! I'm sooo excited ! I'm going to my cousins ' house and I get to go shopping and I actually get to do the 30 hour famine this year ! And my wonderful sister , almost brother-in-law , and beautiful 4 month old niece are coming home for Easter ! Ah , life is great ! : ) 
30 hour famine really put some things into perspective for me . I'm so glad I was able to participate in it this year ! : D 
Oh my gosh , I am so sore ! The track invitational today was very brutal , I must say ... but I survived with a burnt upper body , a bruised < PROPFEMALE > , and a scraped shoulder ! Yeah !! : D 
I SHOULD be studying for American History right now .... but I don't feel like it .... but I need to .... yuck .... 
Your love sustains me , Lord .... <3 
is not sure what to do with herself . First day this week haven't had anything to do . To many things to choose from now ! 
.... :] 
Hey .... Don't settle for a bowl of beans !!!! ( Reminder for my youth group pals out there ) :D 
Been very thoughtful today .... there's a lot to think about .... especially in my mind ... : ) <3 
Oh my word , I'm a TON more sore today than I thought I would be ! Although volleyball conditioning wasn's as bad as I thought it would be yesterday , but it's sure to be worse today ! :P Oh well , this is going to help us . I'm so glad to have a coach that finally cares !! 
Thank you everybody SOOOOOOO much ! I appreciate the happy birthday wishes more than I can let you all know !!! <3 God bless you all ! <3 
It's kind of late , but another huge THANK YOU to everyone who wished me happy birthday ! I did have a great day .... much of it thanks to you all <3 
First official volleyball practice in less than an hour !! I'm so excited ! : ) 
I'M SELLING COOKIE DOUGH AND MAGAZINE SUBSCRIPTIONS IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED ! PLEASE HELP ME OUT ! ANYONE , LET ME KNOW BEFORE AUGUST 23 !!!! 
Personality Analysis : What is Your Most Dominant Trait ? -- My Result : Analytical/Systematic . http://quizme.heroku.com/quizzes/90832/referrals/status?aid=100000648754835 
Confidance . It's something that I thought I had a lot of , but apparently not ... not when it comes to doing well in volleyball . I've realized that all I do is HOPE that I'll perform well instead of being confident and telling myself that I KNOW I'll do well ... but now that's all about to change ... : ) 
Volleyball is so frustrating , yet it is also eye opening . I think I learn something new everyday ... I , unfortunately , still have to learn to actually apply everything I learn , still . : ( 
I love it when I wake up in the morning and realize that it's a whole new day ; no mistakes have been made , no mishaps have arisen , no sin has burned my tender heart ... everything is new and glorious . * Thank You , my God and my Savior * : ) 
Hey ya'll , my Aunt < PROPFEMALE > says thank you for posting pics of me .... she says she enjoys them a lot , and I do too , so thanks from both of us !! Love u all !!!!! <3 :D 
You don't realize you want something so much until you can't have it for a while . This is so pathetic , but .... I MISSED YOU FACEBOOK !!!! 
(\\_/) Haha ! I just learned this ! \ 
(= ' . ' =) Isn't it cool !?! \ 
(\_\") Ha 
OH NO ! IT DIDN'T WORK ! AAAAHHHHRRRRGGGGG ! \ 
phooey . 
Got to watch my favorite movie at church for Chillax Night with the girls ..... they didn't seem to love it as much as I do considering they kept teasing me for quoting every sentance .... oh well , I still love Anastasial anyway !!! : ) 
Of all the traits that I possess , I'd say that my ability to PERSEVERE is what I < PROPFEMALE > the most . I worry and stress and freak out so much ... if I didn't know how to persevere through the hard parts of life , I don't know where I'd be . \ 
Thank you God for such an abazing gift !! <3 
We're like fire and rain ( fire and rain)\ 
You can drive me insane ( drive me insane)\ 
But I can't stay mad at you for anything\ 
We're < PROPFEMALE > and Mars ( < PROPFEMALE > and Mars)\ 
We're like different stars ( different stars)\ 
But you're the < PROPFEMALE > to every song I sing\ 
And I wouldn't change a thing .... \ 
\ 
Too bad I don't have anyone to sing this song with ... oh well ... someday ... all in God's perfect timing ! <3 
< PROPFEMALE>'s everything you're made of \ 
Hiding behind what you're most afraid of\ 
< PROPFEMALE > gives you the strength to stand your ground\ 
< PROPFEMALE > is now ... \ 
:) new song I learned :) 
Life is fragile .... live it to its fullest while you still have it . \ 
We'll miss you Mr. Fisher ; you're in God's loving hands now . Can't wait to see you again someday ... 
Have you ever woken up one morning and immediately felt like something was missing and you needed so desperately to figure out what it was , but you couldn't remember what it was that you needed ? That's what I feel like this morning ... It's like I need to do something or get something back ... but I just don't know what it is . \ 
This is so frustrating ... :/ 
I can't get ANYWHERE on this stupid English paper !!! I can't focus !!! UUUUUUHHHHHHGGGGGG !!!!!! \ 
I will never procrastinate EVER again .... I HATE this paper ... >:/ 
Today had to have been one of the slowest , sadest , most unfocused days I have ever had .... to much upset for one weekend . :( 
Tomorrow's gonna be a tough day .... God help me to make it through ... You are my strength ... <3 
isn't feeling very good today .... might have caught mom's flu bug . Still gotta finish school work , though .... blaac 
is feeling much better now .... no flu bug - Horray !! \ 
Got my physics bridge done , now for the other half of my English paper .... 
My English paper is almost done ; only one more < PROPFEMALE > to go . It's going slowly but steadily . ( I'm gonna win this race !! ) :) 
Let my words be few ... 
< PROPFEMALE > is officially 1 year old !! Eeeeeee !!!! I can't believe how much she's grown ! \ 
Happy Birthday < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Briggs ! <3 :) 
< PROPFEMALE > took her first three steps last night !! Aaaaaahhhhh !!!!!!! 
Lost our game 59-54 ( or 55 , I don't remember which ) . I didn't get to play much :( But the girls that did play did very well :)

Did a lot of cleaning today . It felt good to be doing something productive ! 
Lord , please place a passion in each of us girls ' hearts today that will encourage us to make the choice to give our best efforts whether we're on the court or bench . YOU ARE OUR STRENGTH , LORD ! You give us our abilities to play the game and to make choices ; encourage us to choose not to regret and to take this opportunity we have and dive head first into the unkown outcome completely trusting in YOU . Amen . 
Basketball game tonight ! Bring it on , Lakeview !! WE are on our home court - you'd better believe we won't let you beat us where we represent ourselves the best ! 
Big win tonight !! Not necessarily score-wise , but it marks our turn around point . \ 
Remember the day : DECEMBER 21 , 2010 !!! The day we turned everything around ... 
\There's a reason we don't put our names on the back of our T-shirts ; it's the one on the front that matters . \ " - Coach Zerlaut\ 
Does it seem like Christmas isn't suppose to be tomorrow to anyone else besides me ? I feel like there should still be , like , a week until Christmas ! What's up with that ....?

Yes , the dash IS there on purpose .... :) 
Celebrating Christmas with Daddy's side of the family .... the Meredith's .... DUN DUN DUN ..... here they come ..... BRING ON THE FOOD !!! ;) 
Pretty tired today . Practice was grueling .... loads of running ; I haven't done that much running in a while , it seems . Took an hour nap after practice ... now I have to wash my sheets cuz they're all sweaty !! :P 
Hey everybody , be keep Conor < PROPMALE > and his family in your prayers ... he's a basketball player for the Varsity Newaygo team . Tonight at the game , it looked like he fell on his head and was taken out on a stretcher . I was told he should be okay , but still be sure to pray for him and his loved ones .... \ 
* Please place your healing hand on him , God . * 
I'm walkin ' on sunshin , whoa-oh , and don't it feel good ! Yeah !! \ 
:) :D <3 
\You to have equally beautiful personalities - how do you compare a sunset to a rainbow ? \ " \

\I love the way the stars shine for You\ 
\Keep holding on\ 
My Senior pics are OFFICIALLY on Facebook !! Check ' em out !... but please don't comment on the bad ones - I know the ones that I look aweful in , trust me ! :P :D 
\It's you in me\ 
\But what do you say to taking chances\ 
Calculus test tomorrow ... DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUN !!!! \ 
... I wish I had an Easy button for that =P 
So , I went to Aquinas College today for AQ Sports day . I totally didn't want to go in the first place , but ... I'm pretty glad I did go . I really like Aquinas ... :) 
So , I got an 84% on my Calculus test . Yay !! That fact made this , like , the best Monday ever ! Even though I was still really , really tired .... I REALLY hope there's no school Wednesday or Thursday ! At least just have MCC classes canceled and I'll be the happiest person to actually go to school on a day that was suppose to be a snow day . 
Had a blast tonight with < PROPMALE > Waldon , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > Pylman , and < PROPFEMALE > Meredith : getting lost , bowling , and Taco < PROPFEMALE > ! Maybe next time we'll make it to the movies on time ... :D Plus it was sweet just to talk and catch up with one another . 
Snowball fight tonight ? I think so ! Am I going to dominate ? I THINK SO !! \ 
Bring it on , people ! ;) 
I love my youth group ! Where would I be without all those crazy guys and girls ?... I'd probably be sane for one thing ... ;) <3 Love you all . :) 
\In all your hurt 
You know , I always want to put something on my status , but half the time I don't know what to write because I don't want to put something silly or random on here ; I want it to be meaningful . Why am I never spontaneous ? I'd like to be more spontaneous . I think I need to loosen up a little .... 
Yeah , so I pretty much biffed it in the middle of Meijer's tonight . Not gonna lie , it was pretty embarrassing , but it was kinda funny at the same time . I can laugh at it now . At least it was just in front of a bunch of people from youth group - they won't judge me !! :) 
Hey people , you should all go to the guy's and girl's basketball games tonight in Newaygo , preferably the girl's game at 6:00 ... just sayin ' ... :) 
<3 Fill up my empty spaces , Lord ... <3 
<3 God , You amaze me . :) 
I love my youth group SOOOO MUCH !!!!! I love how we keep each other accountable . I know you guys are there for me , and I appreciate that sooo much . You guys rock ! To the Core !!!! :D 
<3 Each new moment is another opportunity to glorify Jesus Christ - will we truly live them to do just that ?.... 
Guess what ?..... Jesus is my < PROPFIRST > !!!! Happy < PROPFIRST>'s Day !! <3 :) 
\Like a < PROPFEMALE > among thorns is my darling among the maidens . \ " - Song of Songs 2:2 \

If truly living life was easy , then everyone would be doing it . 
\Chains be broken ; lives be healed ; eyes be opened ; and Christ is revealed . \ 
\The < PROPFEMALE > of the blood\ 
To everyone that's going to Winter Camp this weekend : Have LOADS of fun !!!

So , I almost got a really pretty prom dress today for only $20 but I haven't even looked at aything else yet , so I'm waiting to see what else I find .... still , I hope it isn't bought !!

Oh , and BTW , I hope that < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Smith and < PROPFEMALE > Beckman each had an absolutely FANTASTIC birthday yesterday !!! Te quiero mis amigas bonitas !! <3 :D 
Today was a pretty good day .... but it must be ruined with an English paper not even half-way done that's due tomorrow . Why am I such a procrastinator ??? :P 
Hey ! I need sponsors for the 30 Hour Famine ouryouth group is doing March 25-26 ! We're fasting for 30 hours ( duh ! ) to raise money for those that go hungry ... so if you could , please sponsor me . You can give a certain amount of money per hour , like 50 cents or $1 and hour ; or a flat amount like $10 or $20 . Thank you !!! :) 
I am IN LOVE with < PROPMALE > Yamin's music right now ! Especially \Can't Keep on Loving You\ " and \ " Fight for Love\ " - AWESOME songs !! :) " 
I think I'm beginning to see a little more clearly how God's knowledge is truly ENDELESS ! He keeps revealing more and more truths to me , and He even shows me things that I already \knew\ " but not in the same sense ... He just amazes me ... He never ceases to amaze me ... <3 " 
Make me aware , make me see \ 
That everything I am is not all about me\ 
So take my world turn it around \ 
So that the obvious can finally be found\ 
Make me aware , make me aware <3 
Talent show tonight ! Estoy muy emocionado !!! :D 
So , I sang in the tallent ;) show last night , and when I got back home with my family , mom relayed a message to me from a lady saying that I gave her goosebumps . My oh-so-annoying brother , < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > , looks at mom and says this : \She gave her goosebumps ? Why ? Was she that scary ? \ " He's such a brat and such a smart-alec !.... but I'll admit it was pretty funny . \ 
\You can't take me - I'm free ! \ " \ 
I find it somewhat coincidental that I posted my other status just , like , ten minutes before I FINALLY told mom and dad about considering YWAM .... and now I feel just that : FREE !!! \ 
<3 Thank You , God , for being so relentless and for supplying me with the same power that overcame death ! You are truly and utterly amazing ! <3 
Snow and rain , go away , come again another day !! \ 
Unless of course you want to give us a snow day - then by all means KEEP COMING ! \ 
< PROPMALE > Waldon ... you better not be lying to me !... 
I've got the power ! \ 
( It came back on for more than two minutes ! ) 
So , if any of you out there are feeling down , I have a suggestion for you :\ 
Go sit inbetween a couple of guys playing video games and listen to them talk to one another ... that'll get a few laughs out of ya !!! \ 
Trust me , I know these things ;) 
Thirty hours of fasting , rice and beans , peanut butter balls , bowling , and Taco Bell .... how much better can one weekend get ? \ 
Oh yeah !..... YOUTH GROUP ON SUNDAY NIGHT !!!!! :D :D :D 
No weeping , no hurt or pain\ 
No suffering , you hold me now\ 
You hold me now\ 
No darkness , no sick or lame\ 
No hiding , you hold me now\ 
<3 I love you , George ... Can't wait to see you again one day in His presence . <3 
\In the shelter of each other we will live 
I think in such a complex way that the words in my head jumble together , befuddle ( is that a word ? ) my brain , and wix my mirds . ;) 
I feel deprived .... I need my youth group family !!! 
<3 God made only one you , so don't insult His creation by trying to be someone else . <3 
You know those question things that you answer about other people .... so I was doing a bunch of those , and I kept clicking answers that I didn't want to answer that way ... so , yeah , I don't think I'm doing those anymore ; I don't want to insult anyone else ! :P 
Prom dress shopping today !! :) 
I finally got my prom dress today ... for just $20 !!! Here's the catch : I'm not telling ANYONE what it looks like ( besides < PROPFEMALE > , cuz she was with me when I got it ) . You all just have to wait and see it at prom ! :D 
I love storms ! \ 
Well , most of the time :) 
AAAAAHHHH !!! I finally get to see < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Apsey and < PROPFEMALE > Apsey today ! I can't wait to see you guys !! We're gonna have a blast ! :D <3
