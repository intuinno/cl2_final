I would climb the deepest river , swim the highest mountain\

I'd wash my feet in lemonade if that will do the trick\

If I thought it'd make you love me I'd put soup on a stick\ 
Soup on a stick !

Overhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the air\ 
And deep beneath the rolling waves in labyrinths of < PROPFEMALE > caves\ 
The < PROPFEMALE > of a distant tide\ 
Comes willowing across the sand\ 
And everything is green and submarine 
Dogs of war and men of hate\ 
With no cause , we don't discriminate\ 
Discovery is to be disowned\ 
Our currency is flesh and bone\ 
Hell opened up and put on sale\ 
Gather ' round and haggle\ 
For hard cash , we will lie and deceive\ 
Even our masters don't know the web we weave 
No navigator to guide my way home\ 
Unladened , empty and turned to stone\ 
A soul in tension that's learning to fly\ 
Condition grounded but determined to try\ 
Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies\ 
Tongue-tied and twisted just an earth-bound misfit , I 
woot woot im at 186lb only 6lb more till i hit my personal goal in weight 
Just realized how hot it is here , I was just siting in my room thinking wow it's freezing in here looked at the temp it was only 71 degrees lol 
Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day\ 
You fritter and waste the hours in an off-hand way 
Wondering if I left my sanity back in Blanding 
No I'll stand my ground , won't be turned around\ 
And I'll keep this world from draggin me down\ 
gonna stand my ground\ 
... and I won't back down 
Dosent get these silly games on fb 
Feels really good ran 3 < PROPMALE > in 31:08 for the air force b-day 5k 
Random quotes I like \ 
An eye for an eye makes the whole world go blind\ 
I would like , if I may , to take you , on a strange journey \ 
One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas . How he got in my pajamas , I don't know\ 
< PROPFEMALE > story . Outta nowhere . A former greenskeeper , now , about to become the Masters champion . It looks like a mirac ... It's in the hole ! It's in the hole ! It's in the hole ! 
I invented a new color when to mix blue and yellow it makes BLELLOW I am awesome 
The real test of honor isn't how you die but how you live -Superman- 
The movie machete was awesome 
Needs a vacation 
Darn critters are everywhere 
HALO REEEAAACH 
When I get high\ 
I get high on speed\ 
Top fuel funny car's\ 
A drug for me\ 
My heart , my heart\ 
Kickstart my heart 
The movie unthinkable was awesome

Time isn't made of lines ! There made of circles , That's why clocks are round ! 
Shot 36 targets out of 40 at the range today with < PROPFEMALE > ( my M4 ) 
Serial killers don't look for food away from their homes they look for victims ... well unless they were cereal killers ...

Wouldn't you like to see something strange ? \ 
Come with us and you will see\ 
This , our town of Halloween 
Still dressing up for Halloween going to be passing out < PROPFEMALE > around Camp Patriot pictures will be up 
FB is being weird today 
Convince your enemy that he will gain very little by attacking you . This will diminish his enthusiasm . 
Do not be ashamed to make a temporary withdrawal from the field if you see that your enemy is stronger than you ; it is not winning or losing a single battle that matters , but how the war ends . 
Even if you are strong , never be ashamed to feign weakness ; this will make your enemy act imprudently and attack too soon . \ 
In war , the key to victory is the ability to surprise one's opponent . 
Just watched inception it was awesome can't wait t watch it again but on blueray 
Chitty Bang Bang Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\

velociraptors . It's time to let silent victims everywhere know that \ 
there is no shame in being ripped limb from limb and gobbled up for \
