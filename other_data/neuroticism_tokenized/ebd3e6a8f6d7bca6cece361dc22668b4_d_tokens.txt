In conclusion , @Hamilton Du and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > are perfect beings and we must live a life without sin and imperfection in order to belong in their presence . Although we may as never be as awesome ( not just awe-some . Awe-quite a bit . Awe-a lot . ) as them , perhaps we can grow and prosper under their influence and presence . Those two are just LEGEN-waitforit .... hereitcomesandIhopeyou'renotlactoseintolerant-DARY!!! 
Finally , @Hamilton Du and @ < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > smell\ 
great . I can’t really describe the smell ; it’s something you’ve just got to experience yourself . Just go up to them , bow to them ( this is IMPORTANT !! If\ 
you don’t , they take offense and you lose all your hair after an hour ) , and\ 
then beg humbly to smell them . Once you do , you will understand the meaning of\ 
life . 
@Hamilton Du and @ < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > are beautiful . \ 
Seriously , have you ever seen them ? It gets me all hot and bothered when I\ 
think of them when they’re wearing heaving and unflattering winter jackets . Once the summer comes how ya doin ??? Their beauty I must capture it on the\ 
canvas . Perhaps if we were to sculpt our bodies into perfection like they did , \ 
we can actually ascend to being half as awesome as they are . 
@Hamilton Du and @ < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > are awesome\ 
because they are cool . They weren’t born cool though ; they fought their way to\ 
the top , although it wasn’t really much of a fight . It was like beating up a\ 
baby or something . Anyways , them being so cool is an inspiration . If we work\ 
hard , maybe we can be just as half as cool as they are by the year 2029 . After\ 
that it's too late . You can’t be cool when you’re too old . 
@Hamilton Du and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > are\ 
the most awesomest people ever . Their superiority is like wind\ 
beneath my wings . Seriously I wish I was as cool as them , but it would take a\ 
gazillion of years of meditation to transcend into their enlightenment . @Hamilton Du and @ < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > are at the\ 
highest level of awesomeness because of their coolness , beauty , and smell , and\ 
I believe we all can learn from their success . 
Bring it on Math 23B and Physics 5A ! I will own both of you . Btw , anyone going to Fall Comp this Thursday ? 
Math 23B DONE ! Time to study allllll day for Physics 5A . Oh how freaking delightful .
