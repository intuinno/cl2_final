Be a grace note to someone today . ( Grace notes occur as notes of short duration before the sounding of the relatively longer-lasting note which immediately follows them .

Long time the manxome foe he sought -- \ 
So rested he by the Tumtum tree , \ 
And stood awhile in thought .

It's a world of laughter\ 
A world of tears\

That it's time we're aware\ 
It's a small world after all
