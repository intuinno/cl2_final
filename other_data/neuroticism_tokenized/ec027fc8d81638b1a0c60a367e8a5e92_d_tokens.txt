Lost my voice and a lovely fever .... happy new year . :/ 

i need to have another vacation . Hello < PROPMALE > ! 
Let's do the time warp again ! 
On a hot summer night , Would you offer your throat to the wolf with the red roses ? 
Will I lose my dignity ? Will someone care ? Will I wake tomorrow from this nightmare ? 
Here I go again on my own , going down the only road I've ever known .... 
You got something to say ? Then dont be a coward and say it to my face . I'll let you know right where I am ...... 
I am going to say this once and only once , If you wish to speak on a subject that you A)know nothing about except some rumors maybe . B)Have only one side of the story . OR C ) Just have to get your licks in , then have the Testicular Fortitude to say it to me in person , or keep my name out of your mouth . 
Is not satisfied with the snow in the least ...... and damn that black ice ! 
is off to see < PROPMALE > ! 
It's snowin again ! dunno if i should be happy or annoyed . I'll figure it out over lunch . * Noms * 
\ The pieces of my heart are small and broken ... \"- A \ " It's ok . If you let me I will fix it ..... One little black stitch at a time . \"- T " 
Family : It's the reason I live . 
* Watchin < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > perform surgery on trauma center * ..... So if I am close to dying ........ Travis , you take over . Please . 
About to cuddle under 33 1/2 dead fraggles and finish my book ^_^ . 
We never said our love was evergreen , or as unchanging as the sea - but if you can still remember , stop and think of me ... 
Where are my cats ? tell me how can two cats disappear out of a house that is supposedly locked whenever people leave without someone who has a key coming in and taking them ? this really upsets me . 
So the info i have on my cats now is that someone in a red pontiac grand am showed up to my old place and disappeared with them ...... * plot thickens * 
Is so ready to be completely done with < PROPFEMALE > . 
I'm done . 
is not available to take your crap right now , If it's really important then i'll get back to you .

Chillin chillin . 
When you're gone , the pieces of my heart are missing you ..... 
....... and I love you . 
Blech . Rain . 
Youknow you've been trained by the cat when your daily routine involves waiting on the furball hand and foot without questioning why . 
Soooo . 
The government sure is quick to take your money but slow as all hell to give you money back ...... * has been patiently waiting for a tax return *

School in one day(give or take few hours ) 
Week one of school : Officially survived . I'm good with the language of medicine , okish with the billing and really just over the self-empowerment . 
Dear sick people , \ 
Thank you for your wonderful gift of fever and sore throat . Tis the season ! Thanks ! -MeP . S . - 95.9% grade for week one ! 
I would fight for you - I'd lie for you . \ 
Walk the wire for you - yeah , I'd die for you . \ 
\ 
You know it's true . \ 
Everything I do . all , I do it for you . \ 
- <3 
Yay sore throat . :/ 
full upper respiratory infection which has infected my voicebox . 
...... * sigh * .... 
Don't be offended if I haven't contacted you in a bit . I'm just busy busy ! 
Frustrated . 
If only you could see you the way I do ... 
Don't EVER let anyone walk all over you . Not even for one second . If you believe in yourself and what you do to be right , then do not ever let anyone tell you otherwise . You are worth far more than the headaches and stress that others who do not know any better bestow upon you . 
What a day . 
Welcome to heck , I mean , ICD-9 coding , week one . 
Is this the real life ? Is this just fantasy ? Caught in a landslide ..
