“To restore man , who has been laid low by sin , to the heights of divine < PROPFEMALE > , the Word of the eternal Father , though containing all things within His immensity , willed to become small . This He did , not by putting aside His greatness , but by taking to Himself our littleness . . . . The humanity of Christ is the way by which we come to the divinity . ” ( < PROPFIRST > Aquinas , Compendium of Theology , §1-2 ) 
I'm hoping that nothing happened at the School today ! There was a Easley PD Forensics < PROPFIRST > there and a Helicopter hovering above that area and we saw a Robinson's funeral home < PROPFIRST > driving out of the School parking lot around that area . I hope it was nothing !

Germany 3-2 Uruguay ! Well we got third , and I'm happy with that . We beat the odds and made it over all but two of the teams this year , that's quite an accomplishment . I dare say we would be in the final tomorrow if Mueller was able to play !!!!!! Es Lebe Deutschland ! See you in Poland/Ukraine in 2012 Edan and < PROPFIRST > !

\There is no instance of a country benefitting from prolonged warfare . \ " \ 
Oh my gosh ..... I'm so glad I couldn't get to sleep ! Otherwise I would have been at Church an hour earlier than I was supposed to be ! 
Few people ever recognize the true love of God , if everyone did this world would be a better place . People view God as a dictator , or a figment of our imagination , and they fail to see that He exists in constant love for us , and created us for ourselves . Only through loving Him with our whole selves can we truly unite with him in Spirit , and achieve the divine life with God that we were created to partake in . 
Ever wish you culd just take your family and move somewhere else ... start over again ?
