English- who needs that ?! I'm never going to England ! - < PROPMALE > Simpson 
There is hope , for me yet , because God won't forget , all the plans he's made for me I have to wait and see , he's not finished with me yet , Still wonerin ' why I'm here . Still wrestling with my fear But oh . He's up to something , And the farther out I go , I've seen enough to know that I'm not here for nothin ' He's up to somethin'!!

I keep messing up lately . I am so frustrated with myself . Why do I keep making the same mistake over and over !? If I were God , I would have given up on me by now . The amazing thing is that he WON’T give up on me . It doesn’t matter how many times I mess up , or whether or not I feel like I DESERVE his grace or not his arms are still open to me . I am truly amazed by Gods love and forgiveness and I am thankful . :)

He is jealous for me , \ 
Loves like a hurricane , I am a tree , \ 
Bending beneath the weight of his wind and mercy . \ 
When all of a sudden , \ 
I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory , \ 
And I realise just how beautiful You are , \ 
And how great Your affections are for me . \
