Went to < PROPFIRST>'s school tonight ( < PROPFEMALE > Nor Elementary ) for Family Fitness night ... I am out of shape !! But it was alot of fun . 
Is there something wrong with wanting to look good yet in your 50s ?? My mom seems to think that I am trying to look like I am in my 20's or younger ! I don't think just because you become 50 or 60 that you have to look old ! My grandmother died when she was 99 , and she still looked good . Guess I should be used to it by now ... but it still hurts my feelings . Oh well !! 
One thing nice about Facebook is I have found my friends that I used to < PROPFEMALE > out with when I was in high school . 
Shopping for a new printer since someone in my complex decided to help themselves to part of mine !! 
Damn computer not working again !! Thank goodness I have a good friend- Walt that is a computer genius ! | Still think your in the wrong business Walt ... lol . 
getting ready to go to work

Every Person has 1000 wishes , a cancer patient only one : to get better . I know that 97% will not post this as their status , be one of the 3% and put this as your status , at least for an hour , for those who died because of cancer or still fighting it . 
Going to work Again ... whoopee !!!

Friday I had WRAP here- PPL winter relief program ... Boy my apartment needs alot- all my outlets are getting fixed since air blows through them , the windows are getting fixed- a bunch of stuff , plus I get a new refrigerator since this one I have failed . 
> Just did my FASA for online courses for Nursing !! I'm so excited , I will start in January taking my classes .. ( Finally ): -) And I have a job interview Thursday also .. Possibly to work 2 jobs for awhile maybe . Have a great night everyone !

< PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone ! Spending the day with family . 
Wishing everyone a wonderful New Year ! 
I don't understand why people on FB put you as their friend , but then when you try to talk to them they don't reply . Life is too short and we all lost someone who we loved .... Hoping 2011 is a great year and all our loved one's that have passed will always be with us in our hearts until we meet again <3 
This weather is a killer for cleaning businesses ,,, salt everywhere ! Drive safely everyone . 
finally done work !! grr ... 
Busy weekend working again .. lots of jobs . But hey it's money !! 
Silpalda Jewelry Party is rescheduled until tomorrow night@ 7:00 .. due to the weather . 
I am so upset that my employer did not tell some workers to go home if it got bad- which it did ! THe one girl who works for me got stuck 2 times TRYING to go home to East Greenville to her husband and kids . She had to call 911 to get her out ! Now she is @ Best Western and they have no rooms ! Shame on my employer for not caring about their employees safety !!! 
For all my guests that were coming to the Silpalda Jewelry Party tonight .. Please let me know who is still coming . tonight or not . Thank You ! 
Starting a new job the 28th of this month . Gave my notice to my employer last Friday . Wish me luck !! 
last day at my job today and they threw a little party ,, cake , a card that a lot of people signed . Very nice to be wished well on my new job :-) .
