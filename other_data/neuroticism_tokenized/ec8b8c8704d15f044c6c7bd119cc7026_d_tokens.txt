i would like to find an apartment that is relatively cheap , yet big enough for Aidan to have some room to play around in . Hopefully in a \nice\ " part of town . There has got to be something out there . Right ? " 

I just want to thank everyone who tried to help me with finding an apartment !! THANKS ! I actually found one today in Pownal and put a down payment on it . Should be in by next weekend . $695 with all utilities incl . I don't think I could've found any d 
Just stopping in to sayHello ! It's been some time now . I hope all is well with everyone and i hope to be talking to you more often ... soon . 
is on his second week of P90X . It's starting to make me feel better already . Anyone else tried it or trying it out now ? Check it out ! 
I want to wish everyone a < PROPFEMALE > Christmas and a very safe holiday season !! I hope all is well with you and your families . Spread lots of SMILES !! 
Getting ready to bust out some P90X . I really enjoy this routine , it's a lot better than I was giving it credit for . If anyone gets the < PROPMALE > to try it out for a month or so , give it a shot , it's almost addictive . Can't wait for the end of < PROPFIRST > . to get here so i can compare the b4 and after photos ! 
Had a great weekend with Aidan , finally finished Xmas with him , < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > . We all went sledding on what was left of the snow at < PROPFEMALE > Park .... it was fun to see them play like that . Thank you < PROPFEMALE > for taking pictures , I hope to see some soon . 
My boy , Aidan is starting to potty on the potty ! Very exciting . He's growing up so fast . I love everything new that he comes up with ... words ( no bad ones thankfully ) , facial expressions and the way he loves to laugh . He makes his daddy VERY HAPPY !! I couldn't ask for a better son !! 
must be my son :D 
just started back on 3rd shift ... i worked it before , it sucked then too !! I hate trying to find a new sleep schedule . 
finally finished the 1st 90 days of P90X workout . I already like my results ! i can definitly see improvements on areas i was hoping to improve on . Like that 6 pack that i had stored away in the cooler all winter :) i just need to take the after photos so i can compare the old and new . If anyone has ever wanted to try this program out ... GO FOR IT !! I loved it and cant wait for the next routine to begin ! 
loved that i was able to sleep all day long !! 8 to 8 ! I so needed some sleep . 3rd shift has been robbing me of time for myself . 
finally going to get my pathfinder fixed !!!! i have missed my truck ... missed the 4wheel drive is more like it . hopefully I have it before the 10th . 
i hope that everyone is doing alright and that your lives are filled with happiness of family and friends . Take car of yourselves . 
If anyone knows of anyone interested in a COOLER-SCOOTER , 700watt battery power , blue , used maybe 2 hours total , i know of one for sale .... Original price $700.00 ... NOW $400.00 . Send me a message and delivery is possible up to 50 < PROPMALE > . 
I want to thank everyone for a wonderful day !! Especially my handsome son , Aidan . 
I love being me !!! How else could i get through this life ?! Thank you to my parents and to my 3 closest friends for having a part in making me who i am today . 
Can't wait for another nice day to go for a ride on the bike and try to get a pic of Aidan on it ! ( not driving it of course ) but how sweet would that be ? ;) 
THANK YOU ALL FOR THE BIRTHDAY WISHEs !!! I'm so happy that I was able to spend the day with my son and enjoy the wonderful party we had for him at his mommys house . Thank you to all that showed up !! Aidan loved it ! It is AWESOME that I was able to wake up this morning with Aidan on his 2nd BDAY !! Heres to another great day !! HAPPY BIRTHDAY HANDSOME ! 
Aidan has been such a good boy this weekend . I love our time together and he takes such good pics . Hopefully i will be able to load some of them on here soon . 
I just want to Congratulate my friends , < PROPFIRST > & < PROPFEMALE > GALENUS on hearing that they are pregnant !!! YEAAAAAAAAAAHHHH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Good job little < PROPMALE > ! :) 
HAPPY MOTHERS DAY To all of you mothers out there !!! I hope that your families are all doing well and you MOMs got some extra hugs and kisses today . Thank God for moms and mommies , they bring an extra bit of light into so many lives . Thank you for everything !! 
Finally able to get out and go for a ride on the motorcycle !!! Thank God for the sunshine !! 
< PROPFIRST > Baker is doing fine . He's a little scuffed up , pretty even on both sides , possibly a broken nose . He is under great care in the Albany Surgical ICU . Luckily < PROPFIRST > is sleeping some of the pain off right now . < PROPFIRST > s family is staying with him and appreciates everyones prayers . I was with < PROPFIRST > just a couple of hours ago and expect him to be back to ' < PROPFIRST>' in no time . 
May need knee surgery . Find out in a couple of days . 
would like to Thank everyone for the support , prayers and concerns with < PROPFIRST > Baker . I was with him last night and talked to him for a while . Of course he didn't talk back ( a first - if you know < PROPFIRST > ) He is in a medically induced coma to help him rest and to try to speed up the healing process . 
the doctors need to wait onther 5-10 days to see if the brain swelling eases down and any bleeding slows . They need his levels and pressures to plain out before they can do anything for his left leg - which needs attention- and before they can see where the bleeding comes from in his brain . 
He has lots of family and friends always with him and talking to him . I don't see any reason for him not to make a full recovery !! It's going to take time and < PROPFEMALE > . Thank God < PROPFIRST > has that -TIME ! Lots of other people aren't so lucky . 
I also heard today from his fiancee , < PROPFEMALE > , that hed did open both eyes momentarily and did move some of his right side . GOOD NEWS !! 3 am this morning he closed each hand around his mothers hand and the fingers of another friend ( < PROPFIRST > Bedor ) . I hope to hear more good news tomorrow when i stop to see him . I wish he would flip me off just so I know he knows it's me there . It's like our ' hello ' to eachother :) 
Any news I find out or signs from him I see will be posted as soon as I get back home . Thank you again for all thoughts and prayers !!!! 
I just want to say : If you hear any new info from anyone , unless they have been there with him or talked to his mom or dad or sisters , don't believe it all . I've heard SO MUCH CRAP !! Please try to keep the storytelling down . Some stories have gotten back to the family and is upsetting what some people assume happened . It's never a pleasant thing to hear that people think your son/brother/fiancee/DAD is dead !! 
if anyone has questions or thoughts for the family or myself , write me and i'll deliver messages and answer any quetions I KNOW the answers to . Thank you . 
About < PROPFIRST > Baker : I saw him again today with another friend of ours , < PROPFIRST > Galenus , and < PROPFIRST > looked a bit better , color wise . His pressures and other levels are doing fine . He is still in the induced coma , the less brain activity the better right now . Then hopefuly the sooner the doctors will be able to take care of the injuries on his leg . He won't be losing it anytime soon . 
More and more people voice concern for < PROPFIRST > and I want to let everyone know how much it is appreciated !! < PROPFIRST > is a fighter and I know he can make it through this rough road he about to travel . Especially with all of the support from you and his family . Nothing else is new that I know of . I hope for further progress everyday , and will let you know anything I find out . 
Please keep the kind thoughts , prayers and comments coming . I tell < PROPFIRST > everything you guys say . I'm sure he would let you all know that he his grateful for your concern , as I am . 
can't wait for my son and his mom and her family to get back from their trip to England . Been gone for a week and I miss my boy !! I really need to see him , hold him and give him a thousand kisses . I hope they all had a great time and good wether . I pray for a safe plane ride and car ride home . Daddy loves you Aidan !! c u soon 
I'm so very happy that Aidan , < PROPFEMALE > and the Goldsmiths are home and that they all had a safe trip . From the pictures I've seen , it looks as though they all had a great time visiting family and friends . Can't wait to see more pics . Welcome back . I missed picking Aidan up and squeezing him and giving him kisses . 
About < PROPFIRST > BAKER : I just heard from < PROPFEMALE > ( his fiancee ) that < PROPFIRST > no longer has the tube in his head to relieve the pressure on his brain and that the doctors wee able to perform surgery on his left knee . He came out of surgery fine . He may need some skin graphs done in that area that I know of . 
< PROPFIRST > is now on HALF of the medication that he was on to keep him sleeping . He will still need to rest for the next couple of days , but I'm hoping that by this weekend he may know who is visiting and that he has lots of family and friends there to help him . Thank God that the news just keeps getting better !! We love you < PROPFIRST > . 
< PROPFIRST > Baker is getting better everyday . He is still relaxing and trying to heal as much as possible before getting up and about . It sure would be nice to see him around the house again and hanging out at the laudry mat with his family . They all have been so strong and great through this whole thing . < PROPFIRST > is a very lucky man to have such incredible support around him . 
Why don't you talk to someone who gives a s*h*i*t about what you have to say .... a little clue for you .... it's NOT ME !! Have a nice day : ) 
I can't wait to have Aidan this weekend , it's supposed to be really nice out . Maybe we could head over to the lake for a while and have a small picnic , go swimming and get some more photos of my little man . Don't worry , he'll have plenty of sun screen on :) 
All I want is a great crazy night of fun with great friends and LOUD !!! music !! All are welcome to join us this friday night . Briggs ... you better be there . 
Today I have my boy , Aidan . We are going to head out soon and enjoy some of this awesome day . Hopefully get into a pool so we can chill out for a bit . I hope everyone is having a great day also . HAVE FUN !!!

Then some great time < PROPFEMALE > ing with my boy Aidan , hopefully get a < PROPMALE > to go swimming . Then a pig roast with the sis .

had a wonderful weekend with Aidan , he was so good for his daddy ! We had an awesome time at Uncle Kits bday party/pig roast !! So many kids and people , and water balloon fights :) He and I can't wait for him to be big enough to ride a bike on his own ... daddys back hurts a bit from bending over and pushing him all around their huge yard ... but all of his laughter during it was worth it !! 
Was finally able to jump in a pool and COOL down !! So F'n refreshing !! would've spent half the day there if I could've . Thanks < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > , I really appreciated it . Cu next weekend for another dip :D 
BE GOOD , IF NOT .... BE GOOD AT IT !! 
where is this rain we are supposed to get ? i want to go for a ride on the bike , but not too far if this damn rain is coming . Maybe a quick trip to Manchester and back :) maybe i can find someone to ride with me .......... 
WHERE IS THIS F*CKING RAIN ???? I WANT IT TOO COOL DOWN !!! I WANT TO BE ABLE TO SLEEP TONIGHT ... NOT IN A PUDDLE OF SWEAT !! IS THAT ASKING FOR TOO F'N MUCH ?? 
#1 pick up line : Does this rag smell like chloroform to you ? I can't help laughing , cause I can see some stupid person falling for it !! 
Loving the smell of the rain right now !! It was so F'n hot at work ( surprise surprise ) that my shirt was dripping before it started raining .... yeah , that bad ! I wish I had time to go for a walk in it before getting my boy , guess that will have to wait for later ... if it is still raining by then :) 
Who the f*ck wants to work on a Sat . at 5 am ?! Not this guy .... that's for f*ckin ' sure !! I like what I do and the $$ I make , I just hate that I have to work to make up for other stupid peoples f*ck ups ! If you don't know your job , GET THE F*CK OUT and stop F*CKING with my WEEKEND !! Is that too much to ask ? I don't think so . Thanks again ASSHOLES !!!! 
hanging with my handsome boy Aidan .... he must have stepped on 50 or so ants on the way to the store earlier ... but that was before we even reached the corner of MY street ! It would usually take maybe 5 minutes to get there , but with Aidan , it took almost 20 !! :) he's such a riot ! then we just had to take the long way home ... which seemed reallllly loooooonnnngggg ! I still wouldn't trade it for anything though . 
Hanging out with Aidan over at Grandma's house , playing with his cousin < PROPFIRST > out in the yard . They get along so well . < PROPFIRST > is dragging Aidan around in a sled and then jumping to a < PROPFIRST > Deere toy truck and pushing him into a tree .... over and over and over ... I'm sure it would help if Aidan knew how to steer :) 
Today IS a great day . I have Aidan with me , he's napping right now and looks so peaceful :) When he wakes up , I think we are going to head to the Pownal Fair and check things out ... i hear they have tractor rides and Aidan LOVES the tractors !! \Me ride tractor daddy ? Me ride ? \ " I'm so LUCKY :) " 
Time to look for a new job today ... which sucks .... haven't had to do this crap in 5 years !! \ 
I hate waiting and knowing that I'm losing money ! Wish me luck 
Had a great time visiting < PROPFIRST > in Burlington . He is doing GREAT !! We can't wait for him to come home this coming Friday , it will be so nice to have him back ! Thanks < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > for letting us crash at your house ! 
had a GREAT weekend with Aidan !! I think he really enjoyed the parade today and meeting new people ... and he tries to act shy ... he is really going to be a people person . Thanks for a fun and funny weekend < PROPMALE > !! Love you ! 
Had a great time this past weekend at Stateline Races . Thanks to < PROPFEMALE > , Becca , < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > ..... and of course DBLDN !! Great show guys !!

I love how I feel after a good workout !! Tons of energy now ! Wish there was more to do with the night .... oh well ... I'm not on 3rd shift , but it still sucks !! 
have had a great time with Aidan today ... worked on a craft project , made rice crispy treats and now we're just chillin ' on the couch watching tv . we were watching UFC fights , but he kept yelling at the men , telling them to stop fighting ... LMAO !!! Even growling next to the tv , at one man that kept using kicks !!!!! :) 
Aidan is such a riot !!! I love how easily he makes me smile !! Daddy loves his handsome boy !! 
Loving this beautiful weather !! Hopefully we can get 1 more day of it so I can bring my motorcycle to my sisters house for the winter . Time to go feed the ducks with Aidan .... have fun while it lasts everyone !! 
I don't expect people to act a certain way all of the time , but is it too much to hope that they will at least act sane !? Maybe I just need to learn how to deal with it better or invite some kind of tazer to knock the insanity out with while I'm around them !! 
Can't wait to get tonights workout out of the way so I can just RELAX !!! Work a couple of hours tomorrow and then chill ' til it's PARTY TIME ! I hope you all have a great Halloween weekend , get lots of < PROPFEMALE > and even more TREATS !! :) 
Had a great time last night .... first at < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE>'s party , and then at < PROPMALE>'s ...... DBLDN was awesome and the company was even better !! I definitely needed that walk this morning to help walk off some of last nights fun ! 
Had an awesome weekend with Aidan , he was such a good boy ! I tried to teach him how to do somersaults and he tried teaching me how to holds my hands out to catch a ball !! :) Wish I had video of it all . 
Had an awesome weekend with my boy Aidan !! We were able to get out today and feed the ducks and pet the deer with < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE > .

C U tomorrow Aidan , Daddy loves you ! 
I can't wait to see Aidan tomorrow for his 3rd Christmas !! I wish we could wake up together though , just to see his expression when he notices all of the gifts under the tree ! Daddy loves YOU handsome !

Cold chicken lo mein and reheated crab rangoons for lunch !! YUMMY !! 
Not feeling well today ! Missed work and my handsome little man . Hopefully I feel better tomorrow and can get to work . Can't wait for Friday to get here so Aidan and I can < PROPFEMALE > out for a bit .... sorry < PROPMALE > for not feeling well ... Daddy loves you ! We''l hit the playground for a while Fri .! 
Hoping that my handsome little man is feeling better today ! I miss you < PROPMALE > ! Have a great time with mommy and everyone else at the Sesame Street show tomorrow !! 
Feel like I'm being pulled and pushed in so many directions all at once ... very shitty !! Thank God for Aidan and his smile , or I think I would SNAP !!! I wish I had my truck here so I could smash the shit out of it to release some tension and stress ! Maybe someday ........ 
Anyone know of a cheap but reliable car or truck being sold for under $2G ? I need one ASAP !! I can walk to work , but need a ride to pick up my boy ! Thanks for any help . 
It's been said a million times I'm sure , but ..... Don't miss an opportunity to tell the people you love that you love them !! I never wanted to be that person that misses the < PROPMALE > to tell his Father that I love him .... Unfortunately though , that is the case ! My father passed away last night . I told him ' I Love You ' , but I missed all of the other REAL moments !! He should have heard those words many times before !
