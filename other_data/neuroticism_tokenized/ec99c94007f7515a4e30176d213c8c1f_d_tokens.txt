hahahahahahahahahahahaha 
its such a nice day today . 
life is a most interesting thing it can make you happy enough that you feel you can die happy and it can also make you sad enough to hate the world makes you think sometimes about the choices we make and how they effect how you see and think of the world 
imagine the world around you is just a dream imagine for all the years you live it is just a one night dream that in the end you will awaken from to find a diffrent life in a diffrent body now think what would you do to remember this one night dream after 
heres a subject for you what is the meaning of love ? do you truly understand what love is or how it feels ? can you understand your life and how your emotions effect the way you think and react ? and finaly do you understand just how strong of an effect an 
if money makes the world go round what happends when you have no money ? does your world stop ? 
ever wonder what the meaning of life and death is and how it is a neverending circle of death and birth and death again followed by rebirth . 
if you live through the present it becomes the past we must not forget what happend in the past but we must also remember the lessons of the now . 
lonely im so lonely i have nobody for my owwwnnn im so lonely im still lonely i have nobody for my owwwnnn im so lonely . 
sigh ....... i am so screwed . 
you know i feel so loved sometimes . 
its sad iv spent most of my life surrounded by friends that i made by accident and now i have no friends and i find it oddly lonely . 
pain can be taken as a lesson or a punishment depends on how you look at the situation . 
hmmmmm 
ever take the time to examine your feelings from a observational stand point ? ever feel lonely while you are surrounded by people ? ever get so angry you see red ? think on what you feel it can bring you understanding that you never knew you needed . 
ok ever see someone for the first time and for no reason you know you hate them you stare at eachother for a few seconds and then suddenly ........ you rush at them and start fighting . 
ever wonder why the universe is what it is ? ever wonder about what the world would be like if you could change one choice that you made ? think on the subject of alternet time lines and parallel worlds . wondering if you made the right choice . wondering if 
hahahaha im so far from the drama and yet i still hear about it . 
destiny ....... fate ........ divine plan .......... we are all just pieces in a great game some are players and some are just pieces to be used and throw away when no longer useful . 
I could think of thousends of reasons to live and thousends of reasons to die but all it takes is one reason to tip the scale . 
hehe everone seems to think im going to kill myself . haha 
anyone who reads this comment . what if i told you i was going to kill myself what would you say ? 
wonder why i did it ? wonder why i dont say anything ? wonder why i smile at you ? wondering what i know that you dont ?

There are two kinds of people those who are always learning . then there are those who fool themselves into thinking they have nothing more to learn . 
I look at the sun and see a smile . I look at the < PROPFEMALE > and see a dream . I wake up and learn what i saw wasent a smile or a dream it was you look at me . 
hanging out with sister and watching tv with my nephew punching me in the side . family sometimes you wish the blood was just alittle less thick . 
friend : someone that you enjoy being around . best friend : someone who will rip a hole in your lip with a pvc pipe and laugh the whole way to the hospital . 
There are three things a man should always watch out for . 1 . a knife in the gut . 2 . a shot in the back . 3 . a pretty women . because a pretty woman would do both 1 and 2 while looking you in the eyes with a smile on her face and she would probly twist the knife . 
I'v always wondered what love feels like . 
rabid babies ...... think about it . 
watching my two nephews and beating them with a phom guitar . 
Live life , love life , create life , and finaly end life .
