has been privileged with some AMAZING opportunities this week . 
just got home from playing b ball with his buds . =) 
lost ALL the music in his iTunes =( and really wishes he knew half of that \hacking\ " crap ! " 
is \iffy\ " but thinks working from 10:40 am to 3 ... and then 7:30 pm to 1:30 am just may be the reason he's tired this morning . Pun Intended ^_ = "

HAPPY ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY < PROPFEMALE > !!!! <3 =D 
see's now this has all just been a grand game of chess . I hate getting used . I am no one's pawn . They ave abused my optimism , assumed me a simpleton , and aggravated my temper . =( 
' s day began , progressed , continues to be , and will probably end as : A F***ING BAD DAY ! >.<\" , 2009-09-15 01:27:30 "

Thank you all for the birthday wishes !!!! 
There are only two mistakes one can make along the road to truth : 1 ) not going all the way ; and 2 ) not starting . 
If we could see the miracle of a single flower clearly , our whole life would change 
Never in this world can hatred be stilled by hatred ; it will be stilled by non-hatred - this is the law Eternal . 
Simplicity is the solution for matters of the heart . 
Health is the greatest gift , contentment the greatest wealth , faithfulness the best relationship . 
is the saddest guy right about now . 
From a single flame ... endless candles can be lit and the life of their embers would not be shortened . Happiness never decreases by being shared . 
is CLOSING DOWN PROFILE COME MONDAY . Social is the last thing I feel like being for now . 
is torn between taking a step back from the social scene or allowing it to be a positive distraction . :-/ ... Monday , is indefinate . Time will tell I guess 
to Facebook or not to Facebook ? That is the question ... I like being \connected\ " .. yet maybe I need to disconnect for a while ... " 
is still here .. because I NEED you guys to fill the biggest void I've ever had ... plus your all pretty amazing people too =) 
was bored this morning 
Live purely . Do your work with mastery . Like the < PROPFEMALE > , come out from behind the clouds ! Shine . I LOVE you ALL my brothers and sisters , elders and youth . Happy Thanksgiving =D 
gets to party tonight , and is def . NOT going to be the DD . Namaste . =) 
is sick >_< 
is devoting sometime to his Yoga practice and Faith =D Time to unlock hidden potientals , overcome stubborn procrastination , and show the world the best of ... Phil . 
thinks it funny how Love is evertrue and yet always lying . Pain promises to break your heart , make you cry , and never fail to be , Pain . Love ?.... is evertrue and yet always lying . We are foolish to let one trump the other .. certain to bare both ... challenged to rise above all . Destined ... untransmutably . Well , I beg to differ . To be Liberated from all Pains , from conditional and untrue Loves .... To be free . 
is making this week effectual =) 
Overcome the anger by peace ; the miser by generosity ; liar by truth ; challenges by dilegence ; fear by faith ; pain by love .... Overcome . Happy Friday . 
is in Florida . 
im in love with my cuzin Alivia < PROPFIRST > 
The roots of rectitude lie in the soil of benevolence . Hope you ave a green thumb =) Nameste

is packing , thinking ,... and wishing .

is back home 
Fantasy . It gets the best of me . Hushed lips bust into endless soliloquy . Telling tales of young doves , a flight on Loves sea . Passionately , then passively , then fading to memory . Look , I'll never be a saint , refuse to be a sinner . Nor the kinda guy thats lost so much , anything makes him a winner . This , is < PROPMALE > . This song is dedicated to you all today . Sail =) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQeqmNbA2Hs 
Tonight as I meditate , as I pray , my mind and it's thoughts will be with the people of Hati . May they overcome . May they preserve . May they thrive . This is from the heart . This , is Phil . ---> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZywiFaby6-g 
is wondering why Roly Poly had to be open today ! >_< 
took some much needed down time after a most demanding week !... Then woke up to find me MacBook crashed ? NEVER been a dull moment in the life and times of Sir . < PROPMALE > . 
dares you to find WORDS that rhyme with : Silver , Orange , and/or Purple . 
A jiffy is an actual unit of time for 1/100th of a second . Thus the saying , I will be there in a jiffy ... right ? WRONG >_< 1/ONE HUNDREDTH of a SECOND !! You can't even utter the phrase that fast . Random I know , but ... Happy Friday =) 
in/on the human body there are 10 anatomical 3 letter words . So far me and some pals ave produced : Ear , Eye , Lip , Hip , Rib , Gum , Arm , Leg , and Toe . What is the tenth !?!?! No it can't be ass , or any colloquialisms for the matter . Thus , if any of the above are ... let me know . I ave been thinking on this for 3 days . 
is having terrible headaches since yesterday =( 
Inexorable , such is its passion . Ineffable , such is its bond . It thrives in Simplicity . It teaches us Forgiveness . It is Evertrue , Everlasting , and Everywhere . It is Love . And this is the insight of AmourÈux . Partners , Couples , Lovers , Friends , Heartbroken , and Singles ? Consider me Cupid for the moment ; Happy Valentines Day from < PROPMALE > . =) OneWorld ? OneLove . 
wants peace . I can fight my own battles . I can also choose my battles . Respect my choice . Tis time to forget & move on . Not show rashness or flared tempers . Fact is , at the end of the day I'm the only one affected negatively . From social ties to legalities . I thank you greatly for the support , but all I need is peace & space . No revenge , no take two , no match maker . I'm SERIOUSLY asking for this wish to be respected . 
is :-) 
will make this week Effectual . 
is setting positive things in motion =) Each day we are presented with countless choices . Strive to never waste that privelege . 
if your reading this : I'm glad to see you made it to today , & hope to see you tomorrow . Do not dwell upon yesterday , or fill your soul with sorrow . Focus instead on this very moment , cut yourself some slack . Remember , no one loves you more than YOU , & someone always has your back . A single flame can light endless wicks , never ceasing to be a flame . I am but a candle , lite with love ... pass it on and do the same . <3 
wakes up this morning to find my work database crashed . ALL my projects , images , footage , files , documents , resumÈs , contracts -EVERYTHING- gone . I am devistated and ave my work cut out for me ... 3 years worth of it (: _ :)

Yoga & Training . Hello Monday . 
One can never be happy at the expense of the happiness of others , the peace of others . It poisons the soul . The true way to soften one's strife therefore , is to solace those of another . To surrender to the grace of forgiveness even . To choose Love in the face of an enemy . For in its end , tis not the years in ye life that count . Tis the Life shared and experienced in them . I bid you all a great day . ~ < PROPMALE > . 
Corinthians 13:4 ñ8a | Love is patient , love is kind . It does not envy , it does not boast , it is not proud . It is not rude , it is not self-seeking , it is not easily angered , it keeps no record of wrongs . Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth . It always protects , always trusts , always hopes , always perseveres . Love never fails ... 
is praying . 
Off to the cinema to see Transformers with the family =) 
Off to the Amicalola Falls State Park and Lodge for the day ! =)

Suffering produces endurance . Endurance produces character . Character produces hope . And hope ? Does not disappoint us . Hope we all ave a great weekend ! ~ < PROPMALE > 
The ability to control impulse is the base of will and character . Those who are at the mercy of impulse -who lack self control- suffer a moral deficiency . By the same token , the root of altruism lies in empathy ; the ability to read emotions in others . If there are any two moral stances that our times call for ... tis precisely theses . Self-restraint and compassion . ~ Phil 
is N/A : Heading up to Athens with a friend for the day ! =)
