Peoples ! Give me your < PROPFIRST > again , got a new phone and lost my old number . Just send it to me in a message , please and thank you . 

Freaking happy right now , went swimming in a heated pool and hot tub in the middle of winter ! 
FML- Not my year . Termites this time around !?!? Starting to wonder which God I managed to piss off . 
What kind of asian doesn't like rice !?! 
lol so its now what ? I got out of bed on tuesday , may 4th at 7:30 am and its what ? 10:30 pm now and I still haven't gone to bed ? 
Managed to reread < PROPMALE > Potter , Lord of the Rings , < PROPFIRST > Brown's series that involved < PROPFIRST > Langdon , and everything Tamora Pierce wrote ( 20 novels so far ) within 30 days . Yup , its a sign I might need a life ? 
< PROPMALE>'s right , we might have died a few times within a 15 minute time span . 
lol the time limit I gave myself is 2 and a half months to model/possibly animate something that can be considered awesome . Any bets on how this would go ? 
LOL everythings due tomorrow - FML 
one more class tomorrow then I get to have some fun ? 
So I actually helped my temp boss out today at work . However , I was paying so much attention to minor details and he started to shake his head . He then goes on to stare me straight in the face and ask if I'm retarded ... I couldn't help it , the expression on his face looked like the face my sister makes when she asks the same question so I stare back at him and simply reply \Yes . \ " I cracked up so badly after that . " 
LOL I didn't run over dog with my car ... dog ran over my car . Seriously , this happened . 
It's finally here ... the ending to the Full Metal Alchemist series ! 
lol hot air balloon ride later ... better bring my camera . 
What < PROPMALE > said : I like walking home . \ 
What I hear : I like guacamole . \ 
\ 
Gee ... wonder how I heard that ? 
lol you know you're not a real asian if white rice by itself makes you sick ? 
.... I really want a cinniman/brown sugar pretzel from Auntie < PROPFEMALE>'s right now .... so who's going to AX ? 
2 girls and three guys go to a Ramen shop . There's a black guy , his roommate , a couple , and an asian girl . Who ate the most ? 
Ate another Double Down , brought it home ... put an extra slice of cheese in there to make it better ? - Proud moment brought to you by the self-proclaimed leader of the anti-health brigade ! 
Life sucks when you've procrastinated past the point of no return , and you're listening to Lady Gaga songs to keep you up . ;-O ? 
Sister came upon a revelation when trying to get me to eat salad :\ 
Sis : If you want to reform your image and be a good guy , eat salad . \ 
Me : What does that have to do with anything ? \ 
Sis : Bad guys don't eat salad ! They always eat meat , drink wine , or something . \ 
* silence*\ 
If its not a difining trait of that villian , no bad guy ever eats salad . She's got a point ... I might as well stay a bad guy , right ? 
dear god , it's way too hot today ? or is it not cool enough ? my brains melting ... 
Interesting weather today ? For those of you that have work , nice way to wake up if you were oversleeping anyway . 
To those of you that are graduating or did graduate at the same school as me , answer me this . What the hell is with the \bachelor hood\ " that they gave us ? " 
Graduated , now what ? 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas people ! 
Out of country starting from the 18th , don't know when I'm coming back ? 
I want to go home . D: 
Car got towed . Yup , I'm boned . 
So I figured out why this week fails . Chinese New Years is not my holiday . In fact it signals something terrible instead . My logic is this : I dislike rice with a passion , and being asian , that's like a crime against nature . So the Chinese gods decided to punish me at the start of every New Year . Last year , only my room got termites , all the other rooms in my house were unscathed . 
If you see this , please post a reply . It would be greatly appreciated . \ 
I have eight stories and two world concepts . I can't decide which project I would continue working on . So I'd like to hear what kind of story would you like to hear or read ? If you're interested enough , I'll give you brief summaries . 
Have you ever read one of those stories where the herione ends up with at least three different guys liking her but her personality is lacking ? In the end you kind of hope she dies off or goes into a coma cause she's so dumb and you don't want her to end up with anyone at all .... I seem to be reading alot of those stories lately ... 
lol when you cover your head , you leave your rear exposed ... oh so true fortune cookie . 
\ Snythe : its like wining at superman after he saved u and ur entire family from a burning building but forgot 2 save ur cat \"" 
Every time my boss calls me amazing , that means I royally screwed up somewhere obvious . = <

I decided that I want to go skating one day . I also decided I want to own a cotton < PROPFEMALE > machine . 
12 hours of constant pc gaming + little to no exercise = Extremely sore arms D= 
Buying cereal but forgetting the milk is the worst !
