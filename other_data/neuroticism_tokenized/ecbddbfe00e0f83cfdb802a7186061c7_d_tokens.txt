The other day , my friends and I went to Wal-Mart to mess around . I told one of my friends it was impossible to run into an automatic door . She charges at the door , hits it , and the entire thing came off the track . Everybody was staring , wondering if she was ok . We then got out of there as fast as we could . Later that day , I was talking to my mom . She asked me if I had seen what happened to the door at Wal-Mart . MLIA 
is looking forward to eating his body weight tomorrow :) 
Yesterday after school , I got bored and decided to go into the backyard and play with my slingshot . I didn't have any ammo , so I just used peanuts and shot them at trees . I decided to shoot at one really far away . Out of nowhere , a squirrel leaped out of a tree , intercepted the peanut , landed on another tree , ate the peanut , gave me what looked like a thumbs-up , and ran away . Ninja squirrel , you amaze me . MLIA .

so whoever puts together the schedule of classes at U of M - Dearborn needs to seek mental help .

going to the gym , then picking up my car , then Xmas dinner with family , then hopefully some sleep .

is disappointed that there are so many people that cannot accept a great opportunity and gift at its face value and find the need to turn that gift around and hurt the ones who gave it to them . 
can't wait for today to be over ... 
this is such a pain in the @$$ ... 
is having wine with imported French Brie cheese . Now , THAT's a Monday I can live with ... \ 
the only way it could improve is if < PROPFEMALE > Krayushkina was here <3
