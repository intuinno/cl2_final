Is ready to go to skewl , as home is boring . I have no social life !! 

If you like my status , I'll post what I like about you , what I dislike , my first impression , and a confession ... like everybody else ... If I have time ... and know you well enough ... 
I have finally been able to post something on Deviantart with my dial-up , so I shall link to it in celebration ! http://cupcaketreat.deviantart.com/art/River-of-Memories-173285083 
I'm gonna head off for Gem Faire ... Bye everybody ! I'll try to miss you !! lol jk 
Came back from Gem Faire a while ago , but forgot to fill you guys in ... Sorry ! 
I have just come back from the coast , and I got 21 < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > books while I was there , seven of which being the whole Dark Tower series ! 
I have made a bunch of Half-Life 2 scenarios , that in my opinion , are awexsome , all who are interested , please comment or message ! I can send these saves to you ! Available now ! Start dialing now !!!!!!!! 1 
Also , my skewl schedule is : \ 
\

2 : Theater < PROPMALE > with Mrs. Rust\

Can't wait for skewl !!! 
Conformity is weakness ! Resist society's leaders ! Fight for the god-given right to be yourself ! 
Group mentality leads to hurting others , stop it before it starts . Be a voice of dissent in your sphere of influence ! 
I have decided that life is too confusing to understand . I now surrender .
