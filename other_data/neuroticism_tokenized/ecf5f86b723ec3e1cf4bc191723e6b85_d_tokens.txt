WILL DELETE MY FACEBOOK PROFILE IN A FEW DAYS UNLESS ENOUGH PEOPLE SAY NO ... 

got on facebook just to say , the hair has been cut .

WOOOOO LETS GO ALABAMA ! 
RELIGION IS LIKE A PENIS . It's fine to have one . It's fine to be proud of it . But please don't whip it out in public and start waving it around , and PLEASE don't try to shove it down any child's throat . 
got the most forbidden thing ever .. a phone . message me for the number . 
Society & economics is based on an old outdated model where giving something to someone would rid the original owner of their copy , so everyone who wanted a copy had to buy one from someone else who would lose theirs . There might be actual development costs involved in making these copies . Example , for every wheel in the market , someone had to make that wheel . With digital copies , u only need to make the wheel once . 
Why fight the biggest revolution in information flow since the printing \ 
press when you could easily work with it by adding services that \ 
actually add some value beyond the free act of making a digital copy ? 
HAPPY INTERNATIONAL CAPS LOCK DAY . 
Going to be Obama for Halloween . 
Unknown Bible Quote of the day : “Everyone who divorces his \ 
wife and marries another commits adultery , and the one who marries a \ 
woman divorced from her husband commits adultery . ” - < PROPMALE > 16:18
