#2 : Nothing : This means something , and u should b wary . \ 
#3 : Go Ahead : This is a dare , not permission . Don't do it ! \ 
#4 : Whatever : Is a woman's way of saying F- U ! \

So let me get this straight ......... Kelsey Grammer can end a 15 yr marriage by phone , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > can be on divorce #9 , < PROPFEMALE > Spears had a 55 hour marriage , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > and Tiger Woods , while married , were having sex with EVERYONE , 53% of Americans get divorced and 30-60% cheat on their spouses . Yet , same-sex marriage is going to destroy the institution of marriage ? Really ? Re-post if you find this ironic 
A good friend would go to the drug store to buy you a pregnancy test but a best friend would stand outside the bathroom door yelling , \NAME IT AFTER ME ! \""
