The family .

Dear Mr. President , \ 
I hear you would like to freeze pay rates for soldiers next year . Please also consider cutting your own pay to save much more money for our country ? While you're at it , cut down congressman's pay too . If the people who risk their lives don't get an increase in pay , why would we raise pay for those who take no risks and reap the benefits ? Keep it going if you agree

My parents were MEAN to me when I was a kid . They made me do chores , go to church & school . Gave me a curfew , suggested I get a job & work for what I wanted . They insisted that I do my best at school & my job & to take pride in my work . I grew up with morals , a good work ethic & respect for the law & my elders . I thank God everyday for my \Mean\ " parents . Copy and paste if you agree "
