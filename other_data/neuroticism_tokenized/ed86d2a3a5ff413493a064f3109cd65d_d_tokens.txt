It seems as though I got what I wanted ... These are the necessary steps ... Then why does my heart hurt ? : / 
I decided that there were almost no pictures of ME on here , so ..... I kinda went cr @zy with the camera . & I had already fixed my hair .... for once ^_^

I believe that the ONLY thing that you would NEVER want to find after you have lost it , is weight ; ) 
went to see my 87yr old greatgrandmother after having her breast removed b/c of breast cancer(she had it for 10 yrs before she told anyone and got treatment)It had spread to her arm and they have been able to get rid of most of it through radiation & chemo . She lives by herself , she still cooks for herself & family & regularly attends church etc . etc . Needless to say , she is an amazing , sometimes stubborn , woman ; ) 
Dance team : I haven't been able to upload the videos b/c my usb adaptor cord is shot and best buy said I would have to order one from Sony ... : / trying to make it work though 
Had to quit the dance team : ' ( 
When I was in 4th grade I used to say that my heart hurts&it turned out to be acid reflux , caused from stress . Anyway , I was prescribed heartburn med&it worked . So now my heart hurts in a new way&the med doesnt work for it . Only time will heal this hurt&I wish it would come sooner , especially at night . The previous & continuous stress was&is unintended , but this was on purpose . Regardless , it still hurts : ' / 
Got to see the VSCC dance team perform at half time after I got out of class tonight \
