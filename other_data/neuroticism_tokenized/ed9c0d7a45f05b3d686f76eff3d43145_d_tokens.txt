Dear < PROPFIRST > I've got a letter I would like to send , It's lacking strings of words with punctuation at the end . But should I trust this dialect ? To convey the right effect ? Dear < PROPFIRST > I've got some things I'd like to set in pen , I would have used a pencil but lead's just not permanent . Should I trust my printer's ink ? To express the things I think ? 
I'm falling even more in love with you , Letting go of all I've held onto , I'm standing here until you make me move , I'm hanging by a moment here with you 
Not knowing how to think , I scream aloud , begin to sink , My legs and arms are broken down , With envy for the solid ground , I'm reaching for the life within me , How can one man stop his ending , I thought of just your face , Relaxed , and floated into space ! 
Never gonna be alone ! From this moment on , if you ever feel like letting go , I won't let you fall . When all hope is gone , I know that you can < PROPFEMALE > on . We're gonna see the world out , I'll hold you ' til the hurt is gone . 
I always seem to be breaking the dress code ... :]
