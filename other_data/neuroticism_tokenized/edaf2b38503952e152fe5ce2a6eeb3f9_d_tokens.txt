God is great , beer is good , and people are crazy . :) 
Shit's about to hit the fan . 
It's funny how you make my heart race .

Time isn't wasted when your getting wasted . 
Boys amuse me .

Lights out . 
Gahhh , i'm awake and feel like a zombie . 
The next time you come around , i'm going to kick your ass , motherf***er ! That'll teach you to stop running your mouth and calling me a liar . I have no need to lie to her , but apparently you feel the need to . 
What am i going to do with myself ? 
It's possible that i could be going to Ocean City w/ my brother :D 
Hours of dowloading music to windows media player ... fun fun . 
Watching \whose line is it anyway ? \ " Falling asleep shortly . Hit me up if you need me . " 
My brother's going to be here tonight ! :D 
Change of plans , my brother is going to be here around one o'clock! :D even better . Text it up . 
Seriously , are you trying to get your ass kicked ? I'm not dealing w/ this shit . I never gave you my number , and i don't want to talk to you . Honestly , your pathetic . Leave my name outta your drama w/ her . I have no part in the relationship . 
Laying on the floor , watching my brother play \a boy and his blob\ " Quality family time :) " 
Your one smooth talker ; and it kills me . 
Anybody , text me . 540.325.0155 . 
I know i shouldn't want to be w/ you , but for some reason i do . Maybe its b/c you make my heart race ; or maybe its b/c you know exactly what i want to hear . But either way , this relationship can't happen . We live opposite lifestyles . If you can change , then maybe i'd consider it . But until then , friendship is the only option . 
I need to set the butterflys free . 
Thinking about getting my belly button pierced tomorrow . 
You can't always get what you want . But if you try sometimes , you just might find , you get what you need . 
Going to do laundry w/ < PROPFEMALE > . Going to get my belly button pierced later w/ < PROPFEMALE > & < PROPFIRST > :D Hit me up if you need me . 
I'm not going to give up . I'm not going to let her get her way with this one . Go ahead and talk shit to me bitch , because the next time you do , i'm going to go off in your face . I'm not going to stand on the side lines and let you ruin my life . I'ma fight til the end . I'm going to voice my opinons , no more holding back . I'm not afraid . 
I'm not going to give up . You can't have your way everytime < PROPFEMALE > , life is no burger < PROPMALE > . I'm not going to stand on the side lines and watch you ruin my life . \ 
Go ahead and talk shit to me bitch , i'll blow up in your face . I'ma fight til the end . I'm going to voice my opinons , no more holding back . I'm not afraid . 
I have nothing to say to you anymore . Don't fucking call or get in touch with me . Your a piece of shit . You two belong together . Don't even try talking to me when you arrive here with her . If i never see your face again i won't mind . I thought i had it good , but things can change in a new york minute whem you find out that your mother has been a trifling bitch your whole life . I'm going to snap on somebody . 
Going to < PROPFEMALE>'s house fo the night . 
For some reason , i like the way you lie . &`+ i wish i could forget about you . \ 
But you know , you two deserve each other , because your both liars . 
Let's see how many people respond to a sign saying , \Honk if horny\ " lmao . One honk so far . "

Babies are spending the night tonight , along with Abranda . (: I'll have to get some sleep eventually . I'm worn out . 
Sleeeeeeeeeep (: 
Its sooo cold outside ! 
Broken shattered dreams , \ 
Her insides are torn apart by the seams . \ 
Crimson spattered across the wall , \ 
Disguised footprints travel through the hall . \ 
No one was able to hear her screams , \ 
Her insides are torn apart at the seams\ 
Welts and bruises tattoo her being , \ 
Cuts and gashes she is now seeing . 
So , i read my mom my poem , and now she thinks i'm completely morbid haha . (: 
Ugh , school :/ 
Why do i let you get to me ? 
Something about you is so addictive . 
All this time you were pretending , so much for my happy ending . 
That's life < PROPFEMALE > , you slip off track & try to get back . You won't always make the right choices , when you listen to the wrong voices . But you still try to succeed in the end . You'll have regrets , you'll make mistakes , you'll fall flat on your face & look for a hand to help you back on your feet . People will betray you , people will use you , & they won't think twice about it . But remember that none of them matter . 
Baby , it's cold outside <3 
I want to hide from the world . 
You can fall off a building , you can fall out of a tree , but baby , the best way to fall is in love with me . 
Can i have directions to your heart ? 
Hello , I'm a thief , and I'm here to steal your heart . <3 
I tear my heart open , I sew myself shut\ 
My weakness is that I care too much\ 
And my scars remind me that the past is real\ 
I tear my heart open just to feel . 
Words i'm hearing are starting to get old . 
Why do i have a feeling that i've been wasting my time this past week ? Oh , because i have . 
I don't know what to feel anymore . 
I've realized that i can't change you . 
All in all , today was pretty okay . (: 
Now i just need to forget , fuck the forgiving part . 
Hate the player , because he's the one that starts the game . 
I love you Kayla . <3 Without you , this whole outcome would've been a complete disaster . Thanks so much for giving me advice & sticking by my side . My sister . (: 
Bitch , i don't want your gonorrhea . 
Guys are dicks , enough said . 
Today is a brand new day & i'm going to make the most of it . (: 
You don't mean anything to me . 
Can't wait to get my tattoo ; Deathbat on my lower back ;D 
How do you refrain from liking someone you shouldn't ? I think i just fail at life . Fuck my life . :/

I just laughed , and it actually hurt my mouth . Ahah .

( 1/2 ) Around three this morning a tornado touched down in strasburg . It was the scariest moment of my life . It just goes to show you that things can happen 
( 2/2 ) when you least expect it to . Iloveyou < PROPMALE > Milgrim . <3 
Sure life is up and down , but trust me it comes back around . <3 
My weakness is : I care too much . 
I'm ready for a change . 
Highschool changes people , and not always into someone you want to associate with anymore . I have no one anymore , but its better than pretending . 
Save the drama for your momma . 
Is life really worth living ? Its so much easier to just be buried six feet under , than it is dealing with all these problems . I need a sign . 
I hate when people watch a youtube video , start saying what they say , and claiming that it belongs to them . 
A relaxing day , for the most part . 
< PROPMALE > Milgrim , you are the most adorable guy i have ever laid my eyes upon . <3 
Taking Back Sunday <3 
Parents suck . 
Moving days ; 
I just want things to be official already . We have nothing to lose . <3 
Finally pretty much settled in . (: 
I love my new hair . (: 
School is so pointless this week . 
Its so hot outside ! 
I really have no < PROPFEMALE > . 
Move to Florida ? 
You really can't trust anyone in this damn county , especially < PROPFIRST > Staffa . 
Laying around with < PROPMALE > . <3 
Dustin <3 you make me oh so happy and giggly . (: 
He makes me genuinely happy . 
He makes me genuinely happy , thats all that matters . <3 
I miss him so much , and its only the first day apart . <3 
It's just like magic .. <3 
Everything has beauty , but not everyone sees it . 
I feel incomplete without him here . I miss you Dustin <3 I want to know what forever feels like . 
I'm longing to be with him . <3 
I hate when i can't get in touch with him . :/ 
Fuck off , mother nature .. 
My heart is with you <3
