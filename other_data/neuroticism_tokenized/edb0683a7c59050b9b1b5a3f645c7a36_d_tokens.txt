wake up your heart-Wake Up your Heart by Days Difference 
Just a couple of years ago i bet you never thought you would turn out the way you did . \ 
We all aspired to be the best and had our futures planned out . Now look where you are . Now tell me that you are exactly who you wanted to be . 
Hehe .......... 
\The Catalyst\ " by Linkin Park ...... LOVE IT " 
“Growing up is never easy . You hold on to things that were . You wonder what's to come . But that night , I think we knew it was time to let go of what had been , and look ahead to what would be . Other days . New days . Days to come . The thing is , we didn't have to hate each other for getting older . We just had to forgive ourselves ... for growing up . ” 
Remember when you thought boys had cooties ... when friends were new , dreams were un-shattered and worries few ... when recess was too short and life was too long ... decisions came easily without need to belong ... when storks delivered the babies and passions weren't so strong ... 
Looking at fb with my new ipod touch

The Girl you just called fat ? She has been starving herself & has lost over 30lbs . The Boy you just called stupid ? He has a learning disability & studies over 4hrs a night . The Girl you just called ugly ? She spends hours putting makeup on hoping people will like her . The Boy you just tripped ? He is abused enough at home . There's a lot more to people than you think . Put this as your status if you're against bullying
