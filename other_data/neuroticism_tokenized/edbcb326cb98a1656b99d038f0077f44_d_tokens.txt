I'm at war with the world and they\ 
Try to pull me into the dark\ 
I struggle to find my faith\ 
As I'm slippin ' from your arms\ 
It's getting harder to stay awake\ 
And my strength is fading fast\ 
You breathe into me at last 
I'm awake I'm alive\ 
Now I know what I believe inside\ 
Now it's my time\ 
I'll do what I want ' cause this is my life\ 
here , right now\ 
I'll stand my ground and never back down\ 
I know what I believe inside\ 
I'm awake and I'm alive 
I'm at war with the world cause I\ 
Ain't never gonna sell my soul\ 
I've already made up my mind\ 
No matter what I can't be bought or sold\ 
When my faith is getting weak\ 
And I feel like giving in\ 
You breathe into me again 
Waking up waking up\ 
In the dark\ 
I can feel you in my sleep\ 
In your arms I feel you breathe into me\ 
Forever hold this heart that I will give to you\ 
Forever I will live for you
