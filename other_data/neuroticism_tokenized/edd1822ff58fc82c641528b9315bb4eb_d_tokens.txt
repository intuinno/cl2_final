Thanks to everyone wishing me a happy birthday , you made my day ! 
Last night I had a dream that I received the prototype for a new nintendo wii game . It gave me the ability to go inside people's minds when they were sleeping . The first mind I went into was < PROPFEMALE > Lubicz's . It was so AMAZING ! But then later , < PROPFEMALE > dropped an atomic bomb on the country of My Little Pony Land , poor little ponies . I'm sure < PROPFEMALE > loves ponies , which was why it was such a weird dream ! 
Laser cats will one day enslave the human race . 
I got this new app called the iRelax . It plays relaxing sounds ( Chinese flute , Birds , etc . ) that help you go to sleep . However , every time I turn it on it wants to know my current location . How the heck am I supposed to relax if my itouch app wants to know where I'm currently using it ? Secondly , today when I turned on the app , an add for ' Axe washes your balls ' popped up . I'm officially scared . 
is going to a math final soon . For all of you chickadees sitting in a final exam right now , I wish you luck ! ( You guys probably don't need luck though , assuming that you are all intelligent people and that luck is not a physical element that is capable of manipulating the outcome of different situations , but oh well ! ) =) 
Avatar at Navy Pier tonight =) 
is sad 
Is feeling better

is the only person who likes the secular student organization ... what has the world come to ? 
The symbol for femininity is supposed to resemble a woman's mirror , for she is concerned of her appearance , while the symbol for masculinity is supposed to resemble a male's battle shield as he braces himself for combat . The symbols are old , but don't you find it quite ironic that the symbol that is used today by feminists world-wide actually portrays a sexist view on women which feminists often seek to abolish ?

The school just paid probably circa 1000 dollars to add another pair of unnecessary doors in the back exit of the library . They've locked the doors so we can't use it as a route to our studies .
