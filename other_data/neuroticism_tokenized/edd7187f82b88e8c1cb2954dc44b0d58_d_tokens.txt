Happy New Year , everybody ! 

My knitted sock monkey is stalled because I'm having trouble with the short rows . :-P 
Watched the movie Twilight . Some of the worst hair dye jobs , ever . 
is reading Going Postal by < PROPFIRST > Pratchett . Good stuff ! 
Whoa , dramatic thunderstorm directly overhead . 
Insomnia sucks . 
My head hurts . Coffee withdrawal . 
is eating hot , fresh-baked bread with butter . Yum yum ! 
Went jogging in a torrential rain ... don't have to worry about overheating that way . Reminded me of PT in Okinawa , where my shorts became so waterlogged that I had to grab hold of the waistband . 
Check this out : someone got a hold of my debit card number and tried to buy stuff . Luckily , USAA was all over it even before I noticed . What's funny is , the account only contained about twenty bucks . Someone tried to steal from the wrong person ! Baaaa-haaa-haaaaahaaa ! 
Where , oh WHERE is that draft I saved of a note ? I don't feel like writing it again !! 
Just re-watched Casablanca . Gets better every time . < PROPFIRST > Raines had the best lines , ever ! 
Fortune cookie : \You shall seek out new adventures\ " [ ... and new civilizations ... ] " 
POLL : Should I throw my computer out the window ? Yes or no . 
Looking forward to this weekend -- < PROPFIRST > , here I come ! Woo-hoo ! 
There's a guy out there determined to eradicate every single leaf on the planet ... I want to go beat him over the head with his leaf blower . 
Really wishing I had a Coke in my hands right now . 
Manson follower < PROPFEMALE > Atkins has died . Huh . Ain't that a damn shame . 
Looking forward to leaving this town , if only for the weekend . :-) 
* Sigh * Yep yep yep . 
Awright , I've got to see Zombieland ! Gotta ! 
Back in humid < PROPMALE > after a three-hour bus trip during which I blasted my eardrums with my iPod . Now I'm nearly deaf but feeling good . 
You know that lady who does the Juvederm ad ? Her smile is totally joyless and empty . I'd far rather look like a shar < PROPFEMALE > . 
Anyone ever see the \Friendface\ " episode of The IT Crowd ? Pretty apt ! " 
Prolly gonna run over to < PROPFIRST>'s and blow that 40% off coupon on some < PROPFEMALE > product ... 
Corona , lime , and greasy , salty potato chips . Check , check , and check . 
Netflix.com is down -- the bastards . 
Spent the afternoon at the VA hospital , where I was a magnet to all the vets who've misplaced their social interaction filters . 
My < PROPMALE > has died and the warranty is expired . :-( 
In a state of panic . And not the good kind . 
Tard . Real tard . 
Still tard . 
Holy crap , Haagen-Dazs green tea ice cream is REALLY GOOD !! 
66 degrees F ., 47% humidity . Yessssss ! 
I dropped my cell into my tumbler of iced tea . Don't ask me how . Anyway , now I'm phoneless for a while . Still have the interwebs , though . 
WTH ? For a lark I turned on my phone , the one I dropped into a tumbler of iced tea two days ago , and it's working . * scratching head * Okay . 
The skies are falling ! Rain pouring like it'll wash us all away . Under tornado watch and flash flood warning . Funny to think that we were in a drought earlier this year . 
Just found out about a former co-worker's passing . Sad and stunning news . :( 
You know you've lived in < PROPMALE > too long when the humidity's at 87% and you don't even notice . 
Thank you , thank you , everybody ! Had a good birthday . My mom treated me to a < PROPMALE > lunch at Rudi Lechner's . Had the beer schnitzel with mustard sauce , a hefeweizen beer , and apfel strudel for dessert . Nom nom ! 
Looks like my local Chinese delivery place went out of business . Bummer . :( 
Wrestling with the temptation to dash to the store for some ice cream ... 
I just had about eight inches cut off my hair ( it's being donated to a < PROPFEMALE > for cancer patients ) . 
I still laugh at fart jokes . 
I just felted a knitted wool cat bed , and now my room smells like a wet sheep ... 
Just returned from running errands ( to Petsmart ) in the rain . Cats better appreciate their food ! Now to enjoy being dry and warm . 
Y'all , it's * snowing * outside ! Fer reals ! 
Really wanting some dairy fat right now . 
Every time I go to the VA , some veteran of either the Vietnam or the Korean war latches onto me . Old dudes love me , I'm tellin ' ya . 
I'm watching A Christmas Story . The movie is set in 1940 , and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE>'s 1983 hair is driving me to distraction . 
You know what ? I don't really care about Tiger Woods . There , I said it .

< PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone ! 
My cat , Newman , was licking the parmesan off my pizza . Fortunately , I'm not a germaphobe . 
Dangerous Liaisons is still one of my all-time favorite movies . I think I like it even more now than when I first saw it . 
Yay , happy new year . 
My cat Neeva put her head through the handle of a plastic grocery bag and got stuck , then tore through the house , terrified and unable to get away from the horrible noisy thing following her . I had to reach beneath the bed , where she sought sanctuary , to cut the plastic bag off her . It would have been funny if she wasn't so upset . She didn't come out for two hours . Cats ! 
Stepped outside , well bundled up of course . It's cold ! I like it ! 
Did some grocery shopping and went a little crazy in the canned soup aisle . 
I got this idea from a friend . Its WAYBACK WEEK ! Everyone change your profile pic to a throwback picture of yourself when you were young !! Copy and paste this , and lets see how cute ( LOL ) we all were ! WAYBACK WEEK ! 
For row 2 , read the next row up on the graph from left to right . 
I yelled at a gangster sliding down a hill because I think I need some serious help . 
My douchy downstairs neighbor is playing her music too loud again . > : -E 
Was gonna go for a run but oh damn , now I'm hungry . If I eat I'll have to wait another coupla hours , and I won't be able to run tomorrow I don't think ... Gahhhh . 
Just came back from a little run , emphasis on \little . \ " But what's important is that I did it . The days where I tried to knock myself out are * over *." 
Has your facebook been slow today ? Check your application settings , go into \added to profile . \ " If you see one in there called \ " unnamed app\ " delete it . It's an internal spy bot . " 
Facebook seems glitchy tonight . 
Walked a total of 3.5 < PROPMALE > today . My dawgs are tard . 
There's a ladybug crawling on my monitor . 
Steady rain all day . It's pooling and flooding , per usual . 
Testimonial : < PROPFEMALE > One Betta Buffet Flakes is an excellent product . My cat Newman screams and cries for a taste when I'm trying to feed the fish . 
OMG , it's that time of year -- the cats are blowing their coats all over the place . Time to break out the Furminator ! 
Newman went to the vet for a bladder infection and wound up catching a cold there , which is now spreading to the other cats . :-( 
is having trouble adjusting to daylight savings time . 
Newman is still having trouble with his bladder . Back to the vet . :-( 
FIRST CONCERT YOU ATTENDED ! Everyone please play ! You will find it interesting to know what your FB friends ' first concert was . Copy & paste this on your profile , then put your First Concert at the end of this sentence ... < PROPFIRST > Nicks , somewhere in < PROPFIRST > , 1984 or 85 
Newman spent night-before-last at the vet so they could get a sterile urine sample . Turns out , there was nothing wrong with him . * sigh * Still , it's good to have him home again and he's been a total cuddle monkey ever since . * < PROPFEMALE > love * 
Last night some turd let his car alarm go off for an eternity . Couldn't hear myself think . I wanted so bad to take a baseball bat to his windshield ! Does that make me a bad person ? 
\Lost\ " keeps getting better and better ! ( Writing a day late because I watch it online since I don't have a telly . ) " 
In Belton now , on my way to < PROPFIRST > tomorrow and then back to Hyooston . 
My brother and his family are in Texas for a visit ... due to the volcano , it doesn't look like they're going back to London as scheduled ! 
Oooh-whee , it's coming down ! 
Please copy and paste this to your status if you know someone , or have been affected by someone , who needs a smack upside the head . People who need a smack upside the head affect the lives of many .

Dear Missy : Please don't headbutt my hand while I'm taking a sip of coffee . Thank you . 
Okay dude , it was a mistake to eat while watching Trainspotting . 
Had a big meal from my favorite Indian restaurant . Now I'm full and sleepy . Zzzzzz ... 
A study revealed that the kind of face a woman finds attractive on a man can differ depending on where she is in her menstrual cycle . If she is ovulating , she is attracted to a man with rugged and masculine features . If she is menstruating or menopausal , she is more attracted to a man with duct tape over his mouth and a spear lodged in his chest while he is on fire . No further studies are expected . - :) 
My Indian meal yesterday left me somewhat unimpressed . It had been over a year since I'd been to that restaurant and the flavor wasn't as good as I remembered ; plus , it was expensive ( luckily I'll get three meals out of it ) . So I bought some Indian cookbooks and I'll cook it myself . Added bonus : hopefully the smell will piss off my downstairs neighbor . Bwaaahaahaaa ! 
Fresh strawberries and cream -- yum , yum ! 
< PROPFIRST > Boreanaz's wife looks like * that * and he * still * cheated on her ? Guess I'll never understand men . 
I'm eligible for a phone upgrade , so I'm checking out the smart phones and stuff , and it turns out that I'd be required to take on a plan with a $80 monthly < PROPMALE > . I can't afford that ! 
Dude , about a decade from now , remind me not to inject weird stuff into my lips . Mmmkay ? Thanks . ( Watching < PROPFEMALE > Newton-John on \Glee . \")" 
Had some sushi -- NOM NOM ! But why does wasabi make the top of my scalp prickle ? 
I want a Coke . Talk me out of it . 
Pet Society and Hotel City are all kinds of messed up today . 
Please put this on your status if you know , \ 
or are related to , someone killed on the Death < PROPFEMALE > . My wish for 2010 is\ 
that people will understand that the Rebel Alliance is a band of \ 
murdering scum . The Empire wants only to bring peace to the galaxy but \ 
these rebels continue to kill our brave brothers in white ... 93% won't \ 
copy and paste this . Will YOU make this your status for at least one \ 
hour ? 
I'm taking a couple of days off running because my knee's paining me . 
I've watched nearly half of Perfume : The Story of a Murderer , and I'm not sure I want to watch the rest . 
It's pouring , which is good because they were talking drought already . The thunder and lightning scared poor Peep . :-) 
We lost power shortly after my last update , so I jumped in the shower while the water was still hot and went to see Ironman . It was good . By the time I returned , the power was restored , yay . 
Harman/Kardon SoundSticks II are possibly the kewlest speakers I've ever laid eyes on -- and they're mine ! Bwaahaaa !! 
says i got three bitches ! Bitch One cooks my food . Bitch Two does my laundry , and Bitch Three reads my status updates . I see you're doing your job Bitch ! 
Posting an update that takes up my entire wall is a surefire way to get yourself hidden or deleted . Don't do it . 
I washed my comforter and draped it over some chairs to let it dry , and the kitties think it's a fort . 
Lost finale tonight . * cries * 
There were some kids with flashlights in the parking lot , poking beneath the cars with a broom and hollering , trying to catch an armadillo . I went outside and told them to leave it alone . What the * hell * is wrong with people ?! And where the hell are their parents ? Is this what I have to look forward to all summer ?! 
Yes , yes , yes ! I found a place to get rid of all my old computer stuff ! Goodwill Computer Works . And it's just down the street from me ! 
Alright , I love animals and stuff , but opossums have got to be the freakiest creatures I've ever seen in my life . :p 
Neeva was caterwauling again and < PROPFEMALE > fixed her with the icy glare of DOOM . Shut Neeva right up . Heh . 
Yeah , that's right , I post about my cats ! So ? I do what I want ! 
Uh-oh , it appears I've developed a reputation as the go-to lady for all your cat needs . A woman named < PROPFIRST > knocked on my door at 2 a.m. and gave me a kitten , saying she can't keep it . All-righty , then ! I've already got too many myself ; I guess I'll take him to CAPS tomorrow . 
UPDATE : So , I took the kitten to CAP yesterday morning but they're so full that they couldn't assure me he'd be adopted . I couldn't leave him there to die , so this morning I'm taking him to my vet for a FIV/FeLeuk test , a rabies shot , and whatever else they do to kittens . Need to set up a neutering appointment too . After that , we'll see how it goes . 
I think I'm going to name the new kitten < PROPMALE > . Unless there are any other suggestions ? A 4-month-old Oriental mix ( wedge-shaped head , big ears ) , black with toffee/amber colored eyes . 
Ooops , changed my mind . The new kitten's name is < PROPMALE > . Just seems to suit him . He's doing better after getting a lot of rest after the jabs he received at the vet . 
Oh for heaven's sake ! I'm terrible at naming things ! I guess it's good I never had a baby . I'm vacillating between < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > or Loki for the new kitten . Loki , the Norse god of mischief , fits to a T . This cat is a whirling dervish ! 
* Really * sick of hearing about < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . Stupid media saturation B.S. 
My UPS person has had a parcel in his truck since Thursday and hasn't delivered it . All I know is , if I don't receive it tomorrow , UPS will receive a very shitty phone call from me . > : -E 
Good thing about having a kitten in the house is that none of the canned cat food goes to waste -- he eats every little bit ( everyone else has gotten finicky on me ) . That guy can pack it away ! It's good though ; he was so skinny . 
Hope < PROPMALE > enjoys his last day intact . D'oh! 
Ugh ... whose bright idea was it to go grocery shopping on a holiday weekend ? Oh right , it was mine . And I forgot something ! 
Whoa , a raccoon just walked up to my front door . I was sitting by the window and he was about three feet away . I've never seen one up close before ! He was big and kinda scary . 
Aw , < PROPMALE>'s grownup teeth are coming in . They grow up so fast ! 
Women are angels ... and when someone breaks our wings ... we simply continue to fly ... ON A BROOMSTICK ... We're flexible like that ... 
PET SOCIETY : I want to thank everybody who helped Peep get her pink playhouse . It's fab ! :-) 
Facebook is acting weird . 
UPS lost my package . They said to contact the shipper . The shipper said to contact UPS . * pissed off * 
Is the Yahoo network down ? I can't get into my email or Flickr accounts . 
One of my cats got ass on me . 
I ordered Munnies . UPS lost them . It's been over a month and a half . Just placed a shitty phone call to Kidrobot . Why why why . Not worth it . I don't even want the damn things anymore . 
It was nice to see everyone at the reunion last night ! 
Back in Hyooston . 
Punkin and < PROPMALE > are tear-assing around the place . You'd never guess that < PROPMALE > lost his nuts two days ago . :-O 
Sure is a good thing I like beans and franks . :-\\ 
There's a young possum on my stoop . What's he doing out at this hour ? 
I can't figure out a vintage Skipper pattern and it's driving me nuts . :P 
Power just came back on ( ten after midnight ) after going out at six-ish due to a thunderstorm . Glad to have it back . Having no power just paralyzes a person . I did go see a movie , Inception . It was confusing . 
< PROPMALE > sank his fang deep into my hand today , for the second time . Right as the first one healed . I've about had it with that godforsaken cat . 
Pirates Ahoy : Where do you find the last piece of the statue ? I've been digging for days ! 
Newman , Peep and < PROPFEMALE > are six years old today ! 
Why do I dislike sewing on snaps so much ? 
Sushi for lunch , with soy sauce and lots of wasabi . Nom , nom !! 
< PROPMALE>'s eyeballing my fish tank . 
25 years ago today , I went to boot camp in Parris Island , SC . 
Who invented set-in sleeves ? Because I don't like sewing them ! Grrrrrr ... 
I think I bit off more than I can chew with this stupid doll dress . :-P 
Autumn has * finally * arrived in < PROPMALE > ! Thank GOURD !! 
The dude at the McDonald's drive-through window looked and sounded just like that guy who sang \The Humpty Dance . \"" 
I think I've come down with a cold . :-P 
I think < PROPMALE > Jeong is my favorite guy , ever . < PROPMALE > Jeong , will you marry me ? lol 
So , those Munnies I ordered in June arrived * today * . Okay ...? 
Dude , I don't know about you but I'm totally hating Ruthless on LA Ink . 
1 . \ 
Go to Google maps . 2 . Go to \Get Directions . \ " 3 . Type Japan as the start\ 
Pet Society : I just bought 13 win/lose boxes and they were ALL pies ! > : -E 
Thank you , everyone , for your wonderful birthday wishes ! It was a good day ! :-) 
Planning on Indian buffet for lunch today . Come to mama ! 
\Trying on jeans is my favorite thing . Maybe later I can get a pap smear from an old male doctor . \ " -- < PROPFEMALE > Lemon " 
I'm feeling the need for some beer and potato chips right now . 
Time for my walk . It's freezing out there . Day before yesterday it was 80 . Whateya gonna do ? 
Anyone play Crime City ? If so , send me an invite ! :-) 
Someone tell me to get off my ass and go exercise . 
Okay , I went . 
Watching Season 3 of \The Wire\ " on DVD . It's great seeing Agent Broyles drop the f-bomb !! " 
Playing some jazz on the radio and it has the chilled the cats right out ! Hilarious ! 
Navy Federal Credit Union just wrote to thank me for being a member for more than a QUARTER OF A CENTURY . Thanks , NFCU , for making me feel old . 
Our opinions of ourselves gets in the way of actually being ourselves . 
Putting off going for a run . Why -- do I think it'll get any warmer ? 
Man ... I didn't even know the < PROPFEMALE > Globes were on last night ... 
And the winner for best dress [ in my humble estimation ] is ... < PROPFEMALE > Mirren ! That lady's a class act . 
Annoyed that I can't skip past the stupid movie previews on this DVD ! That's bullshit ! 
Well , < PROPFEMALE > bit < PROPMALE>'s paw and it's swollen to twice its size . Took him to the vet and now I'm $175 lighter . < PROPMALE > is resting comfortably . 
Watching the movie < PROPFEMALE > with < PROPMALE > on my lap . 
Why is my internetz so slow ? 
Earlier tonight I fell while I was running , and I think I broke my ankle . :-( 
Help ! I've got five cats laying on me and it's SO hot under here ! 
I can comfortably go for another 20 years without eating chicken mcnuggets . 
I put the leftover chicken mcnuggets out on the porch and the possum's eating them right now . 
OMG , my downstairs neighbor called the guardhouse again , complaining about noise I'm * not * making . Get a life , woman ! 
\Fringe\ " ! ( A day late . ) Woo-hoo ! "
