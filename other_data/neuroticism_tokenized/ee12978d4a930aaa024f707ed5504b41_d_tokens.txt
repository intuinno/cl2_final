They say you can't please everyone so you might \ 
as well please yourself . um hm well alrighty then . ^o ~ o^ 
sometimes wonders if what could have been , \ 
really should have been or if I should just be thankful for \ 
unanswered prayers ?? 
is thinking ... and yes you should be scared . <3<3 
The\ 
first thing I see in the morning & the last thing I see at night \ 
are the faces of my beautiful babies . And the thought of them all day \ 
long keeps me going ! <3<3 
It doesn't matter what they say ... words are \ 
just a game ... it's the actions and time they spend with you that show \ 
you who a person really is <3<3 
Spend each day like it is your last day .. Enjoy \ 
your family and your friends ... and never look back .. You'll Be Missed Grandpa . R.I.P. I love you ! <3<3 
Spread\ 
me apart slowly , lick me with your tongue , grab my side and eat my \ 
cream , Damn Oreos are awesome ! 
Whoever made up the phrase \nothing is \ 
Sometimes it's the smallest decisions that can \ 
change your life forever . 
Today is about making me happy .. Been pushing my needs and wants aside for to long .. My happiness is more important than trying to make others happy .. Damn took me awhile to figure that one out .. 
So done with being pregnant .. My emotional mood swings are giving me whiplash 
My Car And I Don't Do Well In The Heat But I Have To Go To The Doctors To Make Sure Ryanne And I Are Doing Okay .. Can't Wait Until She Is Born .. Prego+ Heat = GRUMPY MOMMMY 
So It Doesn't Look Like Ryanne Is Going To Wait Until The 20th Of August .. As Long As She Waits Until The End Of This Month She Should Be Fine . Gave Me Meds To Mature Her Lungs Just To Be On The Safe Side 
Baby Shower Day ! Thank You To All That Are Coming Means A lot To Me ! See You Soon .. 
It's better to be happy and be yourself than to\ 
lie to yourself , please somebody else and be unhappy the rest of your \ 
life ... <3 
R . I . P < PROPFEMALE > .. I Love you Dad , < PROPFEMALE > And < PROPMALE > Jr. . 
When\ 
someone you had great respect for becomes a memory , your memories will \ 
become ever lasting treasures . R.I.P < PROPFEMALE > 
If you're going to judge me on my past \ 
then your not worth being in my future !! 
Men are like unicorns ... you think you found a \ 
real one until you really look and all you found was a jackass with a \ 
plunger on his forehead 
B . O . R . E . D ... the inability for ones BRAIN to stay\ 
OCCUPIED with a ROBUST amount of ENTERTAINMENT to keep one in a \ 
DELIGHTFUL mood ... That's ME ! 
While you can't go back and make a brand new \ 
start , you can start from now and make a brand new end . <3<3 
This sucks .. Want to see my baby girl but playing the waiting game .. 
Just drank the nastiest stuff ever hopefully it helps move this delivery along ..

UPDATE : Ryanne's lungs aren't ready , My doc says to try and hold out alittle longer .. Go Back to the Doc's on Monday , He says most likely sometime next week .. I'm really Uncomfy but I don't want to have another Baby in NICU . Can't go through that alone ..

you've got the last piece , its just the start to a whole different \ 
puzzle .

Mellanie's Eyes Are So Blue I Hope They Stay That Way ... I Love Being A Mother , Couldn't Picture My Life Being Any Other Way !!

So apparently , they don't sell sanity at Walmart . \ 
Its a shame , because they < PROPFEMALE > everything else for such low prices ... 
Thanks Everyone For The Birthday Wishes !!!! 
I'm the kind of person who laughs at a joke the \ 
1st time you tell it to me ... the 2nd time when you explain it to me .. and\ 
5 minutes later when I finally get it ! 
Really Bothered By The Fact Mellanie's Dad Doesn't Give A Rats Ass About Her . Thought I Would Be Ok But I'm Not 
I Don't Know If I Believe In True Love , But I Know I've Never Loved Anyone The Way I Love You !! 
So Just Cause I Believe Something In Things You Don't You Can't Respect Me ! Your Close Minded A ** 
I Tried Hard This Time ! I Really Did ! So Why Do I Feel Like I Failed ! 
Feeling A Little Better Thanks To My < PROPFEMALE > !! 
Blood Isn't Always Thicker Than Water ! The Water In My Life Is Way Thicker Than Blood . 
You Would Think That Having A Nasty Headache Would Stop My Head From Running ! But Nope It's Not ! 
Don't want a knight in shining Armour , what I \ 
really want is a loser in aluminum foil who trips up the stairs at the \ 
castle and names the dragon after me ! 
Just going to smile like nothing is wrong , talk \ 
like everything is perfect , act like it's just a dream , and pretend like\ 
it's not hurting me 
Never Give up on the Person you Love , Because One Day you will find out the Reason why you loved them . You Love them for a reason . Not just for fun ! <3 
Somethings you cannot change , somethings you can , so change what you must , so you can be who you want to be tomorrow !! 
Been Along Ass Two Weeks .. It's Nice To Know That As Sick As I Am I Can Get Better . Lol 
I'm Not Crazy I Just Mentally Checked Out For A Couple Days !! 
Smog Done , Insurance Got It , Fuel Pump With Moms Help ! Feels Good To Get Things Done ! 
I'm trying to hide from the men in the white \ 
coats , but laughing my ass off because my invisible friend is naked 
I understand Hooters is a Restaurant , so tell \ 
me , If they delivered what would they be called ? KNOCKERS ? 
If it is true that what doesn't kill you makes \ 
you stronger by the time I get through this I will be Xena Warrior \ 
< PROPFEMALE > ! 
so freaking angry I bit my tongue .. OUCH 
Join the dark side ? Ha , I am their leader . 
.. WARNING : I speak before I think . 
Why is it we want what we can't have , and don't want what we do have , and never end up with what is truly best for us ? 
Be more concerned with your character and not your reputation . Your character is who you really are , and your reputation is merely who others think you are . 
Where is far far away and how do I get there ? ;) 
Everyone makes mistakes , and sometimes the hardest part isn't admitting you've made a mistake , its moving on , and learning from it . 
... Yes I am F.I.N.E. ( Frantic , Insane , Neurotic and Emotional ) 
It's amazing how you can have to worst day ever , but still laugh at yourself when you push a door that says pull . 
Seriously ?! Think about this for a moment . . . a sponge , Mr. crab and < PROPFIRST > Cheeks all live in Bikini Bottom . . . need I say more ? 
Pumpkins , Bats , black cats , < PROPFEMALE > , ghosts oh my ! This is Halloween baby !!! 
I would show you how i really feel but i wasn't born with enough middle fingers to show you with .

The truth is difficult to hear , hurtful to feel and hard to accept but IT IS WHAT IT IS and if it isn't working perhaps it's time to make a change . 
There can be no love without sacrifice , no choice without consequence , and no triumph without loss ... 
When things start to unravel in your life , the best reaction is to peel away the layers of self doubt so your shield of faith can block the arrows of defeat . 
It's the small things in life , that can make the biggest difference . 
Had An Awesome Day With Mellanie , Looking Forward To Tomorrow With The Kiddies !! Life Is Good !! 
FAITH is a powerful force . It changes things . Faith provides a way when there is no way , an answer when there is no answer 
Great minds think alike but dirty minds work together ;) 
Whenever I feel blue ... I just start breathing again ;) 
Behave ? Sure , I'll try anything once . 
Going Out Gonna See My Cutie !! Hopefully ;) 
a person only has as much control over you as you let them . 
when dealing with difficult people , remember you can't control their actions , only your own reactions to them . 
Remember that we are not human beings going through a temporary spiritual experience - \

We are spiritual beings going through a temporary human experience . 
My Day Was A Bumpy One But My Night Ended With A Smile 
My life comes with trials and many decisions . I know that all the decisions i have made haven't been the right ones . For all who know me . They know I am trying . 
I don't know what happen but I have this feeling everything will be okay ... 
It Feels Good To Be Home !!! 
Going to try it someone elses way for once !! 
Why is it that the kid that needs the sleep the most is almost always the last one down ?? Gotta love my < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > ! 
I Have Made Mistakes But I Will Not Let Them Define Who I Am .
