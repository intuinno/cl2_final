wishes everyone a safe and fun 4th of July celebration ! 

Friendship is a perfect something , between something and something else , ... aw , you know what I mean ... and that's why we're friends . :) 
JEEZY CREEZY ... If I hear one more person say anything about Pres . Obama's plan making you give up your current plan , I am going to go to their house and crap on their pillow ! I am going to suggest an amendment to the < PROPMALE > ( even though it's not needed ): 
Ohhhh man , I listened to < PROPFEMALE > Coulter on CSPAN yesterday , and what a hypocritical wench . She's cute and all but there are bestiality laws since she is barely human , besides I am sure that are there are more teeth than just in her mouth and I am out of stainless steel condoms . ( pure personal rant - I'll get into the details tomorrow ) 
Wishing < PROPMALE > a very Happy Birthday ! 
Someone in the Northern < PROPFEMALE > area tell me you have a Help Desk , Network Admin , Test Lab Admin position available for someone with 15 years of experience .... Meaning , moi . 
Churning darkness of despare . Each swirl a hand reaching to pull under whatever light is left . I tempt the fates , but fates be damned if this be their doing . It cannot get worse , should it then they deserve damnation . Each heartbeat is mocking the darkness , scoffing at it's attempts to stifle . There may be bouts when the darkness rules . I endure , I breath , in defiance of it . I may be down , but I win . 
It's amazing how catharsis can make you feel butt tons better . Whew ! 
Now if I only had some Absynth and a quill , I'd be set . 
Much Better day today !
