My old account was being dumb , so I'm starting over . Who knows , maybe I will actually use this one ! 

Still has not figured out how to turn in my bio summer work . 
does not want want to go to school and is in total denial 
< PROPFIRST > likes the indoor :-) And < PROPFEMALE > likes doing bounces :-D 
< PROPFEMALE > needs new picture of < PROPFIRST > ! My only jumping ones are frightening ! 
< PROPFIRST > was fanta-bulous today ! I rode him alone and he didn't care at all . Yay !

Dad's new horse came last night . Wow . Just wow . 
Oh , and he needs a new name ! ideas ? 
hates the internet . It makes me stay up late instead of showering and going to bed 
Does anyone know if the AP bio lab is due Monday or Tuesday ? 
Teehee ... school can try , but it fails at keeping me from facebook !

just realized she fucked up her OPW . < PROPFEMALE > is Pissed . < PROPFEMALE > does not want to start over . < PROPFEMALE > may just turn in her OPW as is and get points taken off . < PROPFEMALE > hates AP lit 
How the hell am I supposed to get a plot of my life into subtotals ? My life has no plot . I was born , I did some shit , and someday I'll die . Done . 
Good luck barn people at the show tomorrow ! < PROPFIRST > tells me he's glad I'm not making him play though :-P 
really , really , really hates AP Lit . She would like to take a gun , put it to AP Lit's head , and blow its f*cking brains out . There . < PROPFEMALE > knows personification . 
some ( most ? ) days , I hate life . 
< PROPFEMALE > was \sick\ " all day . Cough-cough . What did I miss in school ? " 
< PROPFEMALE > is craving fatty foods . 1/2 jar of peanut butter , huge plate of fries , 1/4lb of brie . No food is safe when I'm around ! 
< PROPFIRST > was a good boy today . I hate my horses butt fungus though . It really need to go away . Preferably without making him lose his hair . he would look odd with a hairless butt 
likes her horse , but really wishes I could have him in a cute 12.2 hh version . The littl ones are fun ! However , he's quite fun in his current size too :-D 
Sorry it took me so long to get the Halloween pictures up 
Life lessons from a dog : When life gives you shit , you can either bitch about it or roll in it ! 
Finished my OPW with 25 minutes to spare ! Now to shower , study for physics , and sleep ! 
I got into college . Woohoo 
Thanks guys ! So far on my B-day , a guy accidently slammed a door into my face and gave me a lump on my head , a bloody nose , and a bruised/bloody toe . Life says welcome to being 18 ! Other than that its been good though 
Why is my horse such a dork ? How many horses < PROPMALE > , forget to catch themselves coming down , < PROPMALE > , akwardly catch themselves , half fall over , and then hurt themselves ? I think he's doing it on purpose . 
Stupid weather . I want to go to the barn :-( 
I love my pony . I hate his withers . I hate snow falling off roofs . Bareback spooking isn't fun . But I stayed on , so's it was funny 
Procrastinating is fun . Bio Challenge ( of death ) is not fun . Which to choose ? 
Think I'm getting ' sick ' coughcough . 
Stayed in bed untill 3 reading , woke up and had Wegman's Ultimate Chocolate cake for breakfast . Great day . 
How did I end up with 2 horses and no one to ride ? Sailor stepped on his leg while lunging and bent his shoe . LOTS of blood , but a pretty minor cut . The inside edge of the shoe was bent downwards so the inside shoe was 2 inches lower than the outside edge ! OUCH ! PS , I feel bad that he dripped blood all over their clean floor . 
Ponies got there teeth done today . Drugged < PROPFIRST > is so much fun ! 
Hound puppies have arrived ! They are so damn cute , I want them . Untill they get bigger , then they can go back . 
How do I explain to a lab that 35 degrees is NOT the right temp to go for a swim ? Silly < PROPFEMALE > . 
Is it May yet ? I want new tall boots ! I can't wait to try on a pair that might actually fit ! 
< PROPFIRST > now has a 3 inch mohawk . I pulled BOTH sides of his mane untill he was left with short spikey mohawk . No brushing or de-burring needed !. We are not showing , taking lessons , or even riding . He's already fat , bald , out of shape , and lame . He's already as akward looking as possible , might as well pull all of his mane out so I don't have to deal w/ it for a few months . 
Went on a trail ride with both ponies ! Sailor went with < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > on < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > . Then < PROPFIRST > and II went on a quick trail ride with Gryphon and < PROPFEMALE > ( and don't forget Tiger ! ) Trail rides are the best , I love the new barn !
