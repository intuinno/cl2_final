Mmmm kool-aid , 
' s SNES will be coming soon ... Maybe 2 days late , but thats ok 
' s favorite thing about getting her hair cut is the extra 15 minutes after when brandice plays with the new cut 
< PROPFEMALE > was her OwO she'll never know .... Unless she checks her messages ... Hmmmm ....... HMMMMM ...... HHHHHHHHHMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GOOD DAY . 
How can this count as not hurting 
I think that possibly , maybe i've fallen for you . 
It hurts to know i'm not enough for you ... 
When a girl is silent , that's pretty dangerous . She's either overthinking , tired of waiting , about to blow , lonely , needs a hug , falling apart or crying inside . and most probably all of those above . 
Knew today would be painful
