Just got back from training my blt guys and I'm glad to say , there's improvement ! 
Home sick :( 
Home and already have a headache 
I am a Machead 
These meds are knocking me out 
\Most folks are about as happy as they make their minds up to be . \"" 
What's wrong with me

So glad tomorrow is the last day of school

Ive realized What is honestly the point in having a relationship when it will end bad in one way or another ? 
Been up for 20 minutes and I'm already bored , I desperately need a hobby . 
Has anyone else been so bored they just follow random conversations on facebook ? 
I'm about to go insane 
So freaking tired , sore and sick 
Prank'd is an awesome show ! 
I was so stupid for dropping my guard again and look what it got me , NOTHING AT ALL except me felling stupid once again for thinking it could be different 
Relationships are so overrated 
I want to go to Washington DC for the 4th !!! 
i cant stop thinking , about life , about love , about everything that life is and that it involves , in some ways its enlightening , in other respects its maddening 
Having fun at cedar point 
So freaking bored 
cant believe summer is pretty much half way over already , this kinda sucks 
Like this status and I will tell you what I like about you , what I dislike , what my first impression was , and a confession . 
Does love exist ? Comment if u believe so , maybe u can give me a reason to believe it 
Just got back from boating and I am worn out ! 
Just woke up and I already want to go back to sleep ! 
I am going to break my media dependency and not watch tv or movies for 24 hours ! or maybe just 30 mins 
1 2 3 4 I declare a poke war ! 
So freakin bored ! 
A hero of warYeah that’s what I’ll beAnd when I come home They’ll be damn proud of meI’ll < PROPFEMALE > this flag To the grave if I mustBecause it’s flag that I love And a flag that I trust 
Trying to design a website and it is NOT going so well 
I just joined Stickam.com! Come view my LIVE stream at http://stickam.com/hero1993 
Summer is almost over !!! OH NOOOOO 
I cant sleep 
Back from dads 
Just spent an hour randomly making an epic soup and mozzarella sticks just to not eat the soup or the mozzarella sticks and just eat two pieces of bread and butter 
I think I'm officially ready for school to start , well I'm about 50% sure , well maybe we shall see how long my attention sta ... xbox 
I can't sleep ! 
Anatomy homework will be the death of me , talk about an epically huge work load ! 
Eureka midseason finale !!!! 
I'm not perfect but I keep trying 
So much homework ! 
Just got back from the band competition , < PROPMALE > Heights was AMAZING !!! Great job guys ! 
Getting the Ap euro work done one step at a time , so in other words I only have a marathon left to go 
Keep making up excuses to not do my homework , maybe i should take mr. roberts advice and find an excuse to do it . 
At dads for the weekend 
Going to play some poker ! Wish me luck ! 
I really don't want to do the Ap euro work ! 
Gave blood today , enlightening experience considering I almost passed out , that takes skill 
I get the feeling this weekend is going to be very boring 
Had my first drug test today , that was interesting . 
Going to cedar point tomorrow ! 
So tired after a very long day at cedar point 
I'm home ! 
Just put pics up from the cedar point trip be sure to check them out 
Paranormal activity 2 was disappointing 
I think I could get used to the OGT class schedule 
There is nothing good to do ! 
Just got done hanging out with < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > , that was fun :) 
Insomnia isn't fun at all , not good enough reason to stay home but annoying enough to make my day miserable 
Staying home today :( 
Anyone want to see saw tonight ? 
Drug test #2 completed , now I have to wait yet another 48 hours for them to probably screw it up again 
Be careful about reading health books . You may die of a misprint . 
Boredom is a slow and persistent death , and rather boring 
The Walking Dead was SWEET !!! 
< PROPMALE > , we have an awkward moment . 
I really don't feel good :/

My xbox just died 2005-2010 :*( 
I think it's wrong that only one company makes the game Monopoly . 
I was at this restaurant . The sign said \Breakfast Anytime . \ " So I ordered French Toast in the Renaissance . " 
A computer once beat me at chess , but it was no match for me at kick boxing 
Feeling like all the pieces are falling into place , which is epically awesome

The season finale of The Walking Dead was amazing ! 
When it all comes down to it in the end you have to ask yourself , was it worth it ? 
\He who is most slow in making a promise is the most faithful in performance of it . \"" 
\One should always play fairly when one has the winning cards . \"" 
Sacrificing your happiness for the happiness of the one you love , is by far , the truest type of love . 
A thing is not necessarily true because a man dies for it . 
Got into an accident today , not cool . 
Tonight at hooters was awesome !!! To say that least ! 
Totally bombed the euro test then I have work from 4:30 - 10:30 joy to the freakin world ! 
Today was a great day :) 
Great night with great company :) 
Off to dads for another christmas family thing 
this break sucks 
Every man has his secret sorrows which the world knows not ; and often times we call a man cold when he is only sad . \ 
< PROPFIRST > Wordsworth Longfellow 
It is a time when one's spirit is subdued and sad , one knows not why ; when the past seems a storm-swept desolation , life a vanity and a burden , and the future but a way to death . \

All alone ! Whether you like it or not , alone is something you'll be quite a lot . \

so bored 
Free me from these restraints , I fear this will never end . 
Whenever a man does a thoroughly stupid thing , it is always from the noblest motives . 
Sometimes you put walls up not to keep people out , but to see who cares enough to break them down . 
Not feeling very good ...
