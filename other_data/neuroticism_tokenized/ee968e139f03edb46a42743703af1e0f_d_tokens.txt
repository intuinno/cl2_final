First game today ! 
Was so tired with 40 seconds to go in the game I couldn't stop the 6th goal from going in 
Is watching UP lol 
Game on Friday . We gotta pull ourselves together 
We lost . The reffs gave the other team the game . Our team got 7 yellow cards . The final score was 3-2 , they scored two goals off of penalties and the third goal was tapped in by a kid that fouled me twice ( in one play ) . ( They had 3 yellow cards ) 
Some big games this weekend , Jets & Jags are both 4-4 and still have a shot at a wild card . Bengals & Steelers , a crucial division game . Green Bay & < PROPFIRST > , Cowboys are 6-2 and the Packers are trying to get into the wild card hunt . Eagles & Chargers are both 5-3 , and they both NEED to win . And then , of course ... Pats and Colts !!!! 
Productive week for the most part : Chargers won , Dolphins won , Broncos lost and patriots lost . And I lost to < PROPFIRST > ... 
Tonights game is gonna be crazy . < PROPFIRST > Brown is out and < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > is in , Which could spell death for the Dolphins . Homecoming tonight !!!!!

Went to some stores with some friends for black Friday . And now Im going out to dinner with my family for my sister's Bday 
Giants are pretty much elimenated from the playoffs . Some big games this weekend , Cardinals VS Titans with ring leader : < PROPMALE > Young , Steelers VS a very angry group of Ravens , Vikings VS Bears with Cutler leading with interceptions and of course : Patriots VS Saints !!! Lets go Chargers & Dolphins !! 
Lets go Bolts !!!

Lets go Miami Warphins !! 
Dolphins BEAT the patriots !!! O.o who's your daddy now 
Our soccer team tied a crappy team ... But the Dolphins beat the Pats !!! And the chargers moved up to the second seed and are ranked 4th best in the NFL 
Off to soccer 
Steelers are finished . I still can't believe they lost to the browns after beating really good teams ... It would take a miracle to get them into the playoffs 
Great weekend . Just got home :)

Lightningbolts falling from the sky , the Jets better not step outside , they might fry . Thats no lie 
Cardinals beat the Packers 51-45 in overtime !! Both offenses went over 1,000 yards in a single game !! Crazy playoff game ! Finish strong < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > 
Lost .. 6-0 . I'm Sorry guys 
Nate Kaeding is the most accurate kicker in NFL history with over 91% accuracy rating in his career . Inly missed 3 field goals this year , out of 35 . 
Last regular season soccer game is today ! Bring it highlands . I'm gonna be a Darrelle Revis JR . Shutting out their best goal scoring side .. Hopefully 
Those blasted lucky Jets .. I've never seen a luckier sports team in my entire life . Week 16 at Indy , the Colts gave the game away . Week 17 at the Bengals , they gave that game away too . 1st Round : If < PROPMALE > completed 6 more passes , the Jets would have lost . 2nd round : the best kicker in NFL history misses 3 in a row and the chargers give the jets 2 INT's .. And the Bolts still lost by 3 
is very tired . Sagemont on tuesday ! 
Saints vs Colts in the superbowl . Who would have thought since week 1 :p 
Practice was so wet and cold .. But it was awesome 
I want to preach the Gospel to the whole world . And when all else fails , I'll use words .

Fun practice today . If you can cross out the 6 < PROPMALE > I ran lol 
Saints win it : 34-27 
If the Colts would have scored one more , my projection would have been really close
