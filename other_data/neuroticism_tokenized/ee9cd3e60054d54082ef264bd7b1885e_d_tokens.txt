GLARMP !!!!!! 
Ugh . 2 hour wrestling practice , then I have to eat , change , and run to pep band simaltaniously(sp ? ) . Long night . 
I dreamed I was missing You were so scared But noone would listen Cause noone else cared 
I went to bed I was thinking about you Aint the same since I'm living without you All the memories are getting colder All the things that I wanna do over 
Just to let you know , If I put lyrics as my status , Im hoping someone will either put the next few lines or the name of the song as a comment . Im weird like that . 
Had a GREAT day ! I went 2-0 at the F/S wrestling tournament . i pinned both of my opponents using my favorite move , the headlock . My second opponent was the < PROPFEMALE > A team 171 pounder .

Good week . 2 pins , 2nd place at SCSBOA Championships , and my first pin against Skyler . A very good week . 
Dead inside / My heart and soul flatline / Put your mouth on mine / And bring me back to life / Dead inside / No other satisfies / My blood runs dry / Take my life / Save me from this death inside 
NURPLE !!!!! 
Something comes from nothing / If you're willing to believe / Because everything has meaning / Everything we see / Are you willing to give up / Everything ? 
What hurts the most / Was being so close / And having so much to say / And watching you walk away 
Ok , so Im playing Mechquest ( yes , im a nerd , I know ) and I look to see who my opponent is , and i see this : his name is Loomnumfoyl . no joke . Cookie for anyone that gets that . 
.... wow . 99 friends ..... 
You're my angel in disguise / My , You're my angel in disguise / You look at me with gentle eyes / My , you're my angel in disguise / You saved me from that one last cry 
< PROPFIRST > Lautner just needs to take his flea-ridden rear end and fake 8-pack and just go die in a hole . 
< PROPFIRST > Lautner supports gender equality !! It used to only be teenage GIRLS that got self-esteem problems from celebrities !! 
I hate when someone you think will accept your friend request ignores it , and you are left wondering if you actually sent it in the first place because it doesnt tell you they ignored it . 
is watching a Dog : the Bounty < PROPMALE > marathon ! This guy ROCKS !!!!! 
Is going to see his Dad's family in Temecula . And suffering Madi withdrawals .... Although they're not as bad as he first thought they would be . 
comment . I'll respond with 1 . something random about you . 2 . which song or movie you remind me of . 3 . a flavor of jello to wrestle you in . 4 . something that only makes sense to you and me . 5 . my first memory of you . 6 . what animal you remind me of . 7 . something I've always wondered about you . 8 . my favorite thing about you . 9.my least favorite thing about you . 
HAS ENOUGH MONEY FOR AN iPOD !!!!! FINALLYYYYY !!!!!!! I also got a bunch of cool dress shirts . and an awesome man-necklace 
WOOO !!!!! GO ELDO !!!!!! Good job with the living < PROPFEMALE > girls ! And nice face shot < PROPFIRST > ! ( lol it like zoomed in on her face ) 
The Kansai band did good too ! :D 
Mice : ( n ) pandimensional superbeings that manifest themselves to humans as cheese-obsessed rodents . Commissioned the creation of Earth to find out what the Question of Life was , and why the Answer was 42 . 
Why do we let it out of control ? Has all this taken a toll ? / I don't know if we can take anymore / We've got to stop and take a look in the mirror before / Step back , take a look inside yourself / From the outside , you can see someone else staring back at you / It's your reflection 
What hurts the most Is being so close And having so much to say And watching you walk away And never knowing What could have been And not seeing that loving you Is what I was trying to do 
What a day . Mr Watson , the AMAZING band director at El Dorado , Is retiring in June , after 35 years of amazing work . All I would like to say is , if you're reading this , Mr Watson , all of us who know you and your work with this band over the last three and a half decades will be sure to uphold the < PROPFEMALE > Hawk tradition of ... exellence that you established and upheld all these years . 
WITH BUTTER !!!!!!!!!! 
has to wrestle the < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > classic with a bad knee ... great . 
wow . 1-2 at my first varsity tournament with a bad knee . and all 3 of my matches were rough . on both of us . Just ask < PROPFIRST > . 
Be very careful if you make a woman cry , because God counts her tears . The woman came out of a man's rib , not from his feet to be walked on , not from his head to be superior , but from his side to be equal ! Under the arm to be protected , & next to the heart to be loved . 
epic sad face ... with butter 
I have asked myself many times why people are the way they are . I have only come to more questions . I have decided to let such a question go , and live my life the way that God wants me to live it . If this requires cutting off contact with certain people that cause me to feel these emotions , then so be it . 
As of late , I have had to enstrange some people for the sake of sanity . Yet I still wonder why ? Is it really that hard for you to act civilly towards me ? I haven't done anythng to either of you to deserve this . Am I really such a horrible person that you can't stand to let me hold Madi's hand , that you have to come between us ? I must say , it has only worked on a physical level . Spiritually , it has drawn us closer . 
I just wish my parents realized that what they ask of me is , indeed , unreasonable . 1 week to do 2 late Lab Reports and 4 other missing assignments IS unreasonable . And it would be a bit more bearable if I was getting a bad grade . But , I have a B ! Just let me study for finals ! 
Got pinned in a lucky roll against Laguna , and lost an exhibition against Cypress 2-1 at the last second . This puts me at 3-3 in season , 3-4 this year . Still feel good , though . 
chek out mah trikked out bumpah < PROPFEMALE > , yo ! 
high on life and < PROPFEMALE > right now . Still not entirely sure why . 
I love how at 7:00 everybody on my FL comes on ... every day . 
Count me in , but don't count me out ! You can't shut me up , you can't shut me down ! 
Close your eyes , so many days gone by . Easy to find what's wrong , harder to find what's right . I believe in you , I can show you that I can see right through all your empty lies . I won't stay long in this world so wrong . Say goodbye ! As we dance with the devil tonight . Don't you dare look at him in the eye ! As we dance with the devil tonight 
OWNED my guy ! I monkey rolled him and headlocked him . Seson : 4-3 ! ** Count me in but don't count me out ! You can't shut me up , you can't shut me down ! Fight through the hurt , fight through the pain ! Without the ache there is no gain , we live our lives for the love of the game ! ** 
Im wrestling 162s at the < PROPFEMALE > Six Planet ! 
Whew . Im wiped . I lost 13-5 to a really tough Villa Park guy , pinned a < PROPFEMALE > guy , and lost 13-8 to < PROPFIRST > . A good day . 1-2 today , 5-5 in season . 
Every long lost dream led me to where you are Others who broke my heart they were like northern stars Pointing me on my way into your loving arms This much I know is true That God blessed the broken road That led me straight to you 
really hates people that play with other people's hearts for their own gain and amusement . 
is playing an alto sax made out of bamboo ! I know youre jealous , < PROPFIRST > Hahn , but try to control yourself 
Forever hold this heart that I will give to you , Forever I will live for you ! 
I am me . if that's too much for you to handle , get out of my face . 
The last four songs I have posted are a bit of the tumult of emotions in my head right now . Someone help me ... 
Im probably wrestling JV against Tustin today . If < PROPFIRST > doesn't make weight , Coach'll bump me down to F/S . Either way , Im going 162's . 
Im probably wrestling JV against Tustin today . If < PROPFIRST > doesn't make weight , Coach'll bump me down to F/S . Either way , Im going 162's . Wish me luck on my World History and Japanese 1 finals ! 
Pinned my Tustin opponent with my favorite move . I was beating him 13-8 when I won . Im 6-5 in season . Breakdown : 5 of my wins = headlock pins 1 win = points 2 losses = pinned 1 loss = outpointed by my rival 2 losses = outpointed in a teammate match :D Im happy ! 
Tell me this isnt pathetic . We ran to Tri-City , around twice , and back , and I was the last one to leave Tri-city , and the FIRST back ! With a bad knee ! This does not bode well for El Dorado F/S Wrestling . 
Thank God for our military protecting us . God bless those who have died for us , and God protect those that are still fighting . 
is pumped . Just cleaned out my room , so now I can see my bench . just a little bit more and I can finally get to working out . That guy is NOT going to beat me at finals ! 
Whoa . that was insane . 45 < PROPFEMALE > . hard weights , and 15 < PROPFEMALE > . running @ a bit over 16 km/hr . More tomorrow and Sunday . I refuse to let him beat me again . 
is making an awesome ring 
Just saw Tooth < PROPFEMALE > . Amazingly funny . Well worth seeing . 
Madi inexplicaby popped into my head , and there she is staying , with characteristic stubbornness . 
is going to shred that cheating sunnuvagun at finals ! 
cant wait for finals ! 
Getting ready to do the Memorial Mile . 3rd day in a row running ... its the easiest way for me to work out . 
Did a 8-minute mile at the Memorial Mile 
is back to training to beat Spires 
wonders how some people can be so self-centered and have such a love for finding the faults of others , yet never once see their own faults . 
Why should I hear what you say any longer , when you don´t even know where I´ve been ? I feel something in me getting stronger , and I won´t get kicked around again ! If you won´t listen to me , then how can you tell me how I feel ? All along I told you that I cannot feel a thing ! 
\What did you do to those poor flowers ? \ " \ " I soaked them in bleach ... and smashed them with a mallet . \"" 
Im wrestling JV 162's if < PROPFIRST > makes weight . If not , Im going F/S . Either way , Im using this match to see how far I have to go to beat Spires on Saturday . 
I won my Canyon match 5-4 . Im wrestling 162 @ F/S League Finals 
Yesterday was amazing ! I placed third at League Championships that day , and had an amazing time at Winter Formal ! < PROPFEMALE > was absolutely gorgeous ! 
Kiss me once for the good times , baby . Kiss me twice for goodbye . You can't help how you don't feel , and it doesn't matter why . Give me a < PROPMALE > to bow out gracefully , cause that's how I want you to remember me . I'm gonna smile , cause I want to make you happy . Laugh , so you can't see me cry . I'm gonna let you go in style . And even if it kills me , I'm gonna smile . 
I would love to say that Im fine . But Im not . I hurt bad . I feel it down in my soul , pulling my heart to pieces . I hope that eventually I'll be able to find a way to light the dark room of my soul and find the pieces , and , one by one , put my life back together . 
I know Im a mess and I wanna be someone . Someone that I'd like better . I can never forget , so dont remind me of it forever . What if I just pulled myself together ? Would it matter at all ? What if I just tried not to remember ? Would it matter at all ? All the chances that have passed me by , would it matter if I gave it one more try ? Would it matter at all ? 
Dear Agony , just let go of me . Suffer slowly , Is this the way its gotta be ? Dear Agony . 
Well , you win . Go ahead , rub it in . I dont care anymore . You were right . I hope you're happy , because I cant be anymore . 
Songwriting seems to be quite the venting opportunity . I feel a lot better already . 
Im going to be allright . Make no mistake , I still hurt , but Im getting better . 
Ugh ... Ouch . That hurt . One of my friends just told me why < PROPFEMALE > broke up with me , and I have to say it bites . 
You dont know how strong you are until you reach your weakest ... I was a mess Monday and yesterday . Im still far from better , but Ive realized that I will survive , and I can move on . I just need time to get my head back on straight . 
Getting better . Im slowly pulling my way out of this rut . I wouldnt be able to pull my way out if it hadnt been for Hali Stafford and < PROPFEMALE > Lansley grabbing my hand and dragging me out , whether I wanted to or not . Thanks . 
Aaaand I see her face on my News < PROPFEMALE > , and down I go ........ ugh . talk about the worst time to look at my News < PROPFEMALE > . I feel like my heart is bleeding ... 
Im SICK of people commenting on my attitude ! I just had the one person in my life that was holding me up drop me and kick me while she walked away . Ive cried myself to sleep three of the last four nights , and I cant bear to leave the house without my glasses because my eyes are bloodshot . Im a wreck in 4th period from trying to keep it together and not fall apart in front of her . Do NOT try to comment on my attitude 
Im feeling a lot better than I thought ... I know she cant read this , but thanx < PROPFIRST > !!!!!! 
Im going to wach the CIF duals today . Go Hawks !!! 
Hers the pattern : I get thrown into the fire , I try to crawl out , and I get pushed back in . Eventually I remember that I have friends in high places and God lifts me out . Thankfully , Ive reached the last stage . It wont be easy , but Im getting over her . I just need time . 
I love how a workout makes everything seem allright . Im already feeling on top of the world and Im not halfway done with my workout . 
All these Valentines Day apps fail . All of them have at least two people I dont know in person , my ex girlfriend , and my big sister ! 
Fourth in CIF . Lost to Temecula Valley . Not a bad run . Next Saturday is the CIF individual tournament . 
Feeling good now . Bout time ! lol 
Met Connor Hipwell's grandmother at church yesterday .... That was wierd . 
Saw Lighning Thief . AMAZING ! And it actually stuck to the book pretty much the whole movie . 
I swear this time it won't turn out the same ' cause now I've got myself to blame , and you'll know when we end up on the streets that it's easy enough to find someone who looks down on you . 
I still believe this ordinary life can make it through . Cause nothing else has ever felt so true ! Let the music take control ! That sound is beautiful And I'll never let it go , no I'll never let it go , no ! 
Noone's gonna take me alive , the time has come to make things right . You and I must fight for our rights ! You and I must fight to survive ! 
Not going to school tomorrow ! Im working the tournament at the CIF Individuals at < PROPMALE > Godinez High School in < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > !

Home takin care of my sis . BOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRREEEEEDDDDDD ! Text me , people ! 
FINALLY !!! Done putting my CDs on iTunes . 1 1/2 hours later ....... 
just saw New < PROPFEMALE > . WASTE OF MONEY !!!!! The girl who plays < PROPFEMALE > killed that character completely . And they made it impossible for anyone who hasnt read the books to know what's going on . And Patterson is only a halfway decent actor . Lautner ( kill me now ) was the only good actor out of the three . If not for him , I would have walked out in the middle . 
Dear world : Id like some consistency please . I mean , Rouge is a conceited , self-centered bastard , but at least hes a consistent conceited , self-centered bastard . Now I just wish everyone else would be that consistent . Im tired of trying so hard to figure someone out , then having to start all over again . 
Dear Lady Luck : I want to smack you right now . Make up your mind ! Do you love me or hate me ? 
Ugh . Im a sophomore , and I already have letters from 4 CA colleges , 2 VA , 2 WA , a < PROPFEMALE > , and an AZ college 
Advertisement Fail : Gravity : 1/2 off for a limited time only ! 
Urk . Too much Chinese food . Today was a heartbreaker . < PROPFIRST > lost in the finals of Masters 6-5 in the 4th round of overtime . As for me , one of my friends from church is coming over for a jam session tomorrow . 
So ... I just searched ' Livin la < PROPFEMALE > Loca ' and in the ' Did You Mean ' section , there was < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > ...... IN JAPANESE ! 
Packing for the State meet . Not gonna be at school Friday , and Im gonna be in Bakersfield Saturday too . This should be amazing . ( I have also come to terms with the fact that I am indeed addicted to wrestling . ) 
< PROPFIRST > CHAVEZ IS THE HIGHEST STATE PLACER EL DORADO HAS HAD IN OVER TWO DECADES ! LADIES AND GENTLETHINGS : < PROPFIRST > CHAVEZ IS 5TH IN ALL OF CALIFORNIA !!!!!! 
Nothing like a morning run to start your birthday . Hoping for a good day ! Although Im scared of what Kailyn is gonna get me . I told her to use her imagination .... * shudder * 
Enjoying the iPod ... * glomps < PROPFIRST > * 
<3 <3 <3 <3 <3 
Got NO sleep last night ... I blame < PROPFIRST > . XD 
Got 4th place at Cadet and went 0-2 in < PROPMALE > . im REALLY out of shape ! Oh well , off to Sadies ( without < PROPFIRST >...) 
Ugh . Tired , sore , yet strangely happy . I got 4th at the Sonora Tournament and went to Sadies two hours later . I had fun , even if < PROPFIRST > couldnt come . Its a bummer that someone stole my iPod though . Oh well , back to my CD player ! 
I predicted < PROPFIRST > withdrawals in my near future . I should be a fortune teller . 
Just checked to see how my new wrestling gear fits . Looks like Im not going shirtless next week ! Goodbye , matburn ! 
Is bout ready to burst . Im SOOOOOOO HAPPY ! Life loves me right now ! 
Ask me anything here : http://www.formspring.me/brandonstone No seriously . Ask me something . 
* little plane flies around my head * ooooohhhh ........ 
Im doing JV folk style , and Im probably going to do JV freestyle . Coach hasnt gotten around to teaching me Greco stuff , so I cant do that ! 
Just got 3rd at JV Folk style , and 2nd place on JV at my FIRST EVER Freestyle wrestling tournament ! Overall , I was 5-2 ( 5 wins by pin , 1 loss by a 1 point minor , and 1 loss by pin in Freestyle Finals ) 
I just messed up my shoulder AGAIN !!! Right before the one tournament I CANT miss ! Grrrr ..... Oh well . At least Im spending my late start day with < PROPFIRST > . That makes me feel better . 
Im getting better at typing with a gimpy wrist . In about an hour Ill be with < PROPFIRST > at PK's . <3 
Grrr .... Lynns aunt shot down our late start day together .... whatever . Today wa decent . Not enough Lynn/Brandon time in my opinion , but Im being selfish . 
More decency . Im 4 pounds overweight .... Grr .... Oh well . For once Im NOT looking forward to spring break . And if you dont know what I mean by this , dont ask . 
Ok , Its official . Im going to punch the next person I hear making fun of cutters . I am so SICK and TIRED of it ! 
is going JV Folk and JV freestyle again . Wish me luck ! 
Well this sucks . I beat my rival from < PROPMALE > in QUADRUPLE overtime , but I messed up my shoulder during the match and had to DQ myself from both classes . Its so bad that I needed help getting out of bed this morning . And Im right-dominant , so I had trouble eating dinner last night ! 
pain , pain , go away , come again another day ..... wait ..... I mean dont come back ! 
I know Im gonna get attacked for this , but : FINALLY ! MONDAY IS HERE !!! 
Does anyone know what call time for Festival is tomorrow evening ? 
whoever said \Words can't hurt you\ " has never been hit in the face with a dictionary .... " 
My dad's on Facebook ........ In other news , Im not entirely sure Im looking forward to Spring Break this year ....... 
* sigh * Spring Break here I come ...... 
Oh joy . Drivers < PROPMALE > here I come ...... 
ORANGE RABBIT TWEEZERS !!!! in other news .... I might be getting an iPod today ! 
I HAZ IPOD !!!!!!!! 
I havent had my iPod for a whole day and Ive already synched it at least 3 times ..... 
I am amused by the fact that the two genres with the most songs on my iPod are Country and Metal . In other news : happy Easter ! 
My new profile pic isnt the best in the world , but I wanted one that has a bit more me , and less wrestling team . The closest I have are the pictures from winter formal with Madi .... Unusable in their original form for obvious reasons . 
I love how theres an earthquake and Im just calmly sitting here typing ...... 
Ok , so three minutes after an earthquake , half my friends are on Facebook ..... Really , people ? 
is reminiscing about how he went from the wimp who hated any form on exercize to the guy who is dying because he cant lift over spring break . 
is lonely ............ 
is wondering why he likes Night Castle by Trans-Siberian Orchestra . Not the album , the song . At least in this song , the Seargeant has a horrible voice , and the instrumental is uniinteresting at best , even during the solos . Yet I love it still . 
Ask me anything here : http://www.formspring.me/brandonstone no seriously , people . Im bored out of my mind . 
is narrating his life in a voice reminiscent of < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . 
Does anybody know how to put FB on my iTouch ? 
is doing the Macarena ...... WITH NO HANDS !!!!! 
has got the funk without the Parlament 
ugh . I HATE my voice . I cant sing worth crud , ESPECIALLY when Im nervous . 
Sometimes the hardest part of finally seeing through someone is accepting what you see ... 
if I came with a warning label , what would it be ? 
says 50% of us are depressed , and the other 50% are responsible for it 
is upset that my multiple personalities are no longer speaking to each other ... 
is replacing the chains on his swing set with bungee cords and launching 3rd graders into orbit . Anyone wanna help ? 
I have the kind of friends that will set my house on fire just to be able to flirt with the firefighters who come to put it out ..... * glares at Madi * 
says never judge a book by its cover . But if the story inside is boring and self-centered , then judge away . 
Padded rooms are fun ! I get a bouncy room all to myself !! 
Although we may be < PROPMALE > apart , your love & laughter always remains in my heart .. here is to wishing you were here . 
wants to know ... If I got arrested , what do you think it would be for ?? 
Tomorrow night , Pinky , we come up with a different plan . Tomorrow we take over Walmart ! 
Levels of insanity ... 1 - Talking to ones self 2 - Arguing with ones self 3 - losing argument with ones self 4 - in no longer speaking to ones self . Where do you think I am ? 
sanity can be cured , I had a friend that was sane . We cured them . 
has lost control of the gremlins ! Drastic measures must be taken immediately ! Pass me the tranquilizer darts !!! 
Sometimes I question my sanity , occasionally it replies ! 
is making sure all jellybeans are dead so they cant say mean things to him anymore . 
I'm not insane . I mean , everyone talks to purple polka-dotted dragons and then slides on rainbows with the pretty pink unicorns , right ? 
wonders if its healthy that his other personality thinks its an orange leprechaun named < PROPFEMALE > ....... 
me and my army of Swedish squirrels are off to go bowling [: 
I'm locked up in a mental institution , but its not as bad as i thought . Im partying with a bunch of orange bananas . And look ! Its raining fruit loops ! 
forget drugs . Im addicted to something much better . <3 
< PROPFEMALE > hits harder than I ever could , so Im just gonna sit back and enjoy the show . 
We trust banks with all our hard earned money so why won't they trust us with their pens ? 
The heart takes care of the stuff the mind cant understand 
If a bunch of midgets are at a baseball game and they do the wave , is it still considered the wave , or just a ripple ?! 
I used to wonder why all the best girls were fictional . Thanks for proving me wrong . 
Pretending I don't love you is like pretending i don't need air . 
i don't want to sleep because ill dream , if i dream ill dream of you so i don't want to sleep because i know i cant have you yet . 
you reach into my weakest moments and remind me that i am strong .. 
They say where there's smoke there's fire , well I hope its true . Cause rumor has it you love me too . 
I just heard that theres a flower called the Foreveryours . I wonder where I can get some and how many I should get you . 
When I first met you I was afraid to kiss you . When I kissed you I was afraid to love you . Now that I love you Im afraid to lose you . 
If stars fell every time you made my heart skip a beat the sky would be empty 
close the door , lock it tight , then i know youre safe tonight , turn on our song , that means the most , believe I'm there & hold me close ... <3 
When I tell you I love you , I don't say it out of habit or to start a conversation , I say it to remind you that you're the best thing that ever happened to me . 
When your voice whispers past my ear , I think there's no one else but you . When I look into your eyes , I know its true . 
has found someone who holds his hand in public , kisses his face not just his lips , and says ' hes the one ' when her friends ask who he is <3 
You found a place deep in my heart I thought I'd never see ; that only proves to me how wonderful you will always be . 
If i had to chose between breathing and loving you , then i would use my last breath to say i love you <3 
It's really amazing how you make me smile =) and the way you make me laugh too . 
Your kisses make me dizzy , your hugs keep me warm , the way you look at me gives me butterflies . You are the love of my life and i will love you forever ! <3 
has the most amazing girlfriend in the world 
I love it when my fingers are entangled in yours , your head on my chest listening to my heart beat . It made me feel so safe like nothing bad could ever happen to us <3 
When people laugh and ask me what I see in you , I laugh and tell them everything you don't . 
describing how i feel when i'm with you is like trying to describe how water tastes ; completely impossible . <3 
You have no idea what the sight of you wearing my jacket with my hat falling down over your eyes does to my heart . 
Some people say their guardian angel is watching over them , but the difference between them & me is that mine fell from heaven to be with me ! <3 
falls asleep with a pillow in his arms tonight wishing it was you . Miss you baby . 
Feels really lonely . I cant sleep . I wish you were here , baby . 
I hear your hopes , I feel your dreams , and in the dark I hear your screams . Dont turn away , just take my hand , and when you make your final stand , Ill be right there , Ill never leave . All i ask of you is : believe . 
thinks sleeping wont be a problem tonight ..... * yawn * about freakin time ....... 
Well , Im happy . Gonna do Drivers < PROPMALE > until < PROPFIRST > texts me , then spend pretty much the rest of the night talking to her . I saw a picture from her girls-day thingy with < PROPFEMALE > Archey and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , and she looks amazing ! 
Stayed up til 3 AM talking to < PROPFIRST > . That was amazing . And well worth the exhaustion . 
Has a shiny Machoke named Acid . I understand if you're jealous .

I promised you Dad not to do the things youve done . I walk away from trouble when I can . Now please dont think Im weak , I didnt turn the other cheek . And Papa I sure hope you understand , Sometimes youve gotta fight when youre a man .

One day of break left ! And < PROPFIRST > is giving me a music stand ........ Alrighty then ! Goodnight , Facebook ! :D 
One more day .... Im counting the stinking hours . 
It takes a man to fight when he knows he cant win . It takes a real man not to fight when he knows he can . 
Finally . Only a few more hours . Break come quickly . 
Im happy . I saw < PROPFIRST > again , and hopefully she had an amazing birthday . 
Ok ..... Mr Peterson was being very creepy today ......

Everyone tries to define this thing called character . It's not hard . Character is doing what's right when nobody's looking .

Yknow what ? Some people really need to learn when to shut up and go away . Thanks for ruining a perfectly good evening . 
Pretty good day , all in all ... Yeah . So Im going to set up for VBS tomorrow , then head over to Hatty's place . 
Urgh . I have a sore throat because of the wind kcking up my allergies . My throat hurts RIGHT where my surgery was . This sucks SO bad . 
So ... Hatty's neighbor scared the living daylights out of both of us ...... That was REALLY creepy ..... 
I'm gonna rock you baby to sleep . I'm gonna make you crazy over me . Im gonna hold you like you've never been held before . Love you till you till you tell me you can't love anymore . Im gonna shake your emotions right down to your soul . Then Im gonna love you all over , in and out of control . If this is how love is supposed to feel , then baby I know I've fallen head over heels . Im gonna rock you , baby . 
My Dad got a Droid , so I sent him all my pics so I could put them on my new ( his old ) phone , but now he cant figure out how to send the pics back ..... fail . 
So ... I cant feel my thighs .... Darn you , < PROPFIRST > ! Although using Lynns head < PROPMALE > prop when I fell was interesting . I got a dirty look for it though ... and about 5 seconds later , she was holding my hand . Gotta love that girl . 
If you watched Hawk Talk today , you know what I mean . KAWAIIIIIIII !!!!!!! 
I love Pillar ! Particularly three songs : For The Love of The Game , Throwdown , and Indivisible . 
Aw yeah , ya like that dontcha ? 
Just got back from the Dance Show . Good job , girls ! I love you , < PROPFIRST > ! The two best performances were the male soloist and the all-male hip-hop dance group . That was amazing . 
Ok , so this was lunch yesterday : \ 
* Grandma takes a peice of meat out of her mouth*\ 
Dad : Too tough , Mom ? \ 
Me : no \ 
Dad : How do you know ? \ 
Me : ' Cuz shes tougher than most of those animals were when they were alive ! 
This is ten percent luck , \ 
Twenty percent skill , \ 
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will , \ 
Five percent pleasure , \ 
Fifty percent pain , \ 
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name ! 
theres the music , nii-san 
lol . Someone just told me the corus line to Remember the Name should be my theme song . 
So Im catching up with one of my friends that I havent seen since Homecoming last year ... I just told her about Madi and < PROPFIRST > ..... LOL 
Sometimes I wish I could change the past . Then I realise that the past has made us who we are today , and it has presented countless opportunities that would never have come if I changed the past . So I'll let the past be , and enjoy the happiness God has blessed me with through the past . 
Well , life is good . 
Wow . So NOBODY has any thoughts on me joining Cross Country ? Im surprised ! 
I just got back from the < PROPFEMALE > Hills Church of Christ's lockin . That was hilarious . The way I think of the song \The Lion Sleeps Tonight\ " will be forever changed " 
Everybody look at givesmehope.com Ive never seen such an amazing collection of stories that GMH . 
Is done with Drivers < PROPMALE > !!! * unce * * unce * 
Every time I look at my profile picture , I cant help but think that she looks very comfy . 
Something that most people fail to see : a horrible personality can make the most beautiful person ugly . And an amazing personality can make the ugliest person beautiful . Im just lucky . I found someone with both looks and personality . 
I hate seeing the pain in her eyes and knowing I caused it ... I hate myself for not being able to help her when she falls ... I hate being so powerless to help her when she needs me ... 
Im so happy knowing that all is forgiven . Neither of us is perfect , and we both messed up . Its time to start again , this time together . Maybe thats what we needed all along . 
Wow .... I seriously cant believe that all flowed out so smoothly to make ultimate ownage . 
I love making Nii-san's life awkward . But enough for now . 
Off to Hatty's! 
Ok , so recap . Ran with Hatty , got a fedora with < PROPFEMALE > , played < PROPMALE>'s dads bass guitar , and watched the most amazing Jazz concert ever . An amazing end to a great day .

Let your mind free and allow your nature to comsume you . Dont hinder yourself with the hate and anger that you force on your heart . Let the natural love that all humans share flow free . Life's challenges are miniscule compared to the love that God has placed in all of our hearts , and that love itself is but a grain of sand to the mountain of His love for us . 
Im the doting uncle . I loves my neices ! I have more pictures of my neices on my phone than < PROPFIRST > . And I have a lot of < PROPFIRST >
