After working with the clinically insane I've realized nones normal 

If you love something let it go if its ment to be yours it will come back to you 
Training in blue < PROPFEMALE > ... what a day off . :( 
Got Saturday off .. thank God ! !!! 
Peace in relationships is knowing that you've done everything possiable on your end to reconcile . If they fail its on them . 
smelled skunks today while out driving .. and the purple flowers my mom loved so much have bloomed !!.. today is a good day . :) <3 
I feel like I'm getting arthritis in my hand from using my phone too much ... 
Funny how things always work out for the better after the bad . <3 
Change only for the better . 
Shopping spree today .. I think so !! :) 
Some days you may feel completely alone , but that is only by choice . 
Its nice being able to trust someone other than yourself . 
Feeling another tattoo . 
Jealousy is troublesome to others but a torment to themselves . 
Third shift . :p 
Working till 11 then going out . 
Working outt so my mood isn't so blahhh and to get my ass in shape . :p
