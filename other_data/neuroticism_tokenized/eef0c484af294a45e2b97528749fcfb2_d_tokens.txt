A male prostitute who enjoy's their job and does it just for the pleasure . The < PROPMALE > , originally named < PROPFIRST > added the H to the end of his name so it would be a better prostitute name : < PROPMALE > ( get it ? ) .

In the universe there is energy and chaos . These two work as opposites . The more energy you dedicate the less chaos exists . When you deal with chaos , without sufficient energy stress ensues . Today I had ZER0 energy . Today was pure chaos . 
Just got google chrome and it is SOOOO sexy :P 
Still another day of school ... A week of hell and now its literally freezing over . 
Awesome time at the zoo with the girl I love :D . Sad when you are old enough to know when the animals are having sex and not just playing . X ( there goes my childhood , everything from horseshoe crabs to lizards and bug were getting it on .

Tomorrow is the 3OH ! 3 concert :D 
19 ... 1 more year and I am in no-mans land . I wont be a teenager , still cant drink and nobody will care about what I have to say :P But I think I like it that way . That lets you slip from existence and be whoo you want to be , lets you decide how you want your life to play out . But for now , 19 still means I belong to that \worthless teenager\ " group . And I am just fine with that :D " 
I think I want to go to Old Chicago tonight ... anyone want to go ? Split a big pizza :)

A long , hot day of work at the ball field but the $70 makes it better :)

is afraid of posting one of those statuses where if you like it I have to tell you crap . I am scared that I will be filling out one for everyone in my friends list >.> 
If love is blind , how do you know when you see it ? Will you know what you are feeling is right ? How do you measure the unfathomable ? Therefore is all love equal , making love and hate blind manifestations of the same raw energy that binds us together ? Dont you feel lost when the person you hate goes missing , just like when your love disappears . Is love really just ones capacity for feeling ? Hate the absence of love ? 
FINALLY . A creative outlet that I have been needing :D . My parents are buying me 90 Tons of River rock to trick out our huge back yard :D . 
< PROPFIRST > Meyer : i \

What does it say about my future roommates when : 1 I go to school in the springs , and they live in the springs but still get a dorm . 2 . They dont have a facebook or even a myspace . And 3 . Two of them appear to be twins ...

I never go through and comment on peoples crap ... I dunno why I always expect someone to comment on mine :P 
I'm content to know that everyone I texted helped me find my phone :) now I need help locating my facebook ... 
The little Reeses Minis are the best Reeses cups in the world !!! 
I just thought of a funny that doesn't apply to me :P . Relationships are like the best meal of your life . No matter how warm , tantalizing , or fulfilling it just ends up being crap by the end of the week . :P 
LOL apparently Feb 18th is the perfect day to conceive if you want a kid to be born 11-11-11 ... what the girls dont get is that their man will be off in a line waiting for elder scrolls skyrim ;) 
One day shall the world slip from space and all our bodies be erased . But I will find peace . Should I but last see your face . \ 
-me , out of bordom 
There is no \I\ " in team " 
Its usually a good day when I am average in a class of chemistry majors ... but its sad when average is a D ... WITH the curve 
Wow ... its a sad day when I even feel like a moron in my own dreams ... >.> 
So tell me ... if the significant other said something ... should I tell you what they said if it would upset you ? Or under wraps ? Different people different ways . You should tell me ... 
well another friday , another quiz in chemistry >.> I must be a masochist to put myself through this and actually still enjoy the class 
Well ... that's quite the conversational piece . And when you think ... what is ? Thats exactly the what I am talking about . 
\The bad thing about the online quotes is that you can't be sure if they are genuine\ " - < PROPFIRST > Washington " 
My dreams lately ... I never have dreams ... This one scared me though . I thought I got an 11 on my last quiz after studying for 6 hours . My dream is dumb though , I got a B , finally I am back above average in a class of chemistry majors :D 
Friday friday friday ...... is in two days .... I pray you havent been tortured in the ways I have .
