I badly want to go home . Right now . :( only 3 more days ? That's 3 too many . 
Have you any idea why a < PROPFEMALE > is like a writing desk ? 
< PROPFEMALE > , I will never understand you . Why would you go back to the real world after you've learned the fantasy actually exists ? 
I want a little Asian baby . 
Even though you tried to hide it , i saw that glint in your tired eyes when you saw me walk in <3 I love you more than life , my darling . 
It's not fair ! How come the one time I'm down for an entire week you're gone ? :'(

People will forever fail you , but good music is always there to catch you when you fall . 
Anyone want to teach me how to play the guitar ? :3 
Odd one , I wish I was you . You're never concerned with acceptance but we are all desperately seeking out , and fitting in with anyone who will accept us . But not you , odd one . 
That was just a dream 
I can go homes now , pwease ? :3 
Safely at home where I belong <3 
Fingers hurt :(

\Moderate behavior is the god of our mental health system . \ " \ " isn't it better to be insane than let them kill the artist in you ? \"" 
? Please allow me to introduce myself . I'm a man of wealth and taste . I've been around for a long , long year , stole many a man's soul and faith . ? 
Just got asked if I was Jamaican , < PROPFIRST > Kinkead . -^_^- 
There is much more beauty to be found in imperfection . 
? All I want is a place to call my own , to mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone . You know to keep your hopes up high and your heads down low . ? 
? So , what if I can't forget you ? I'll burn your name into my throat . I'll be the fire that'll catch you . What's so good about picking up the pieces ? What if I don't even want to ? ? 
* cough cough cough die * guess I won't be sleeping ... Again . 
? And though I've traveled far from where my search began , over seas of green and shores of sand , through the endless , everlasting world out there ... I know that with this burning passion driving me , someday , somewhere , I'll finally see the light I have searched for everywhere . ? 
Dear Florida , you know how I hate wearing pants . And still you insist on the cold weather . Please stop . Thank you . <3 - < PROPFIRST > 
So much work to do . * rolls up sleeves * Let's do this . 
I cans go home now , please ? 
You know that I love you and even though it feels like we're growing more and more apart , this distance is bringing us closer . It's giving us the < PROPMALE > to appreciate every second of the time we do spend together . Don't worry , I'll be home soon . <3 
If you can imagine it , you can create it . If you can dream it , you can become it . 
Going to lunch with Daley today <3 
All I want in this life is your happiness . 
So I just started getting ready for class thinking the present time was 10:30 Tuesday -morning- and not 10:30 Monday night ... * face/palm * I'm going back to bed ...
