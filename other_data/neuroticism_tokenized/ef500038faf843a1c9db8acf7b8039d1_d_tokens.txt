Getting used to my new life . 

' How can I leave it all behind if I am coming back to it ? How can I make a new beginning if I simply return to the old ? ' The answeris in the return U will not come back to the same old thing What U return to has changed because U have changed Ur perceptions will be altered U will not incorporate into the status or world U left behind The river has been flowing while U were gone Now it does not look like the same river 
trying to sleep so I can get up at four fifteen for my first day of clinicals . ugh . 
clinicals . 
clinicals . today is movercise day . how exciting . 
last day of clinicals ! 
Dinner at The Cancun then goin to The Lovely Bones . Gotta see if the movie is as good as the book ! 
little boxes on the hillside , little boxes made out of ticky tacky- little boxes on the hillside , little boxes all the same- there's a green one and a pink one and a blue one and a yellow one- and they're all made out of ticky tacky and they all look just the same . 
I believe that everything happens for a reason . People change so that you can learn to let go , things go wrong so you appreciate them when their right , you believe lies so you eventually learn to trust noone but yourself , and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together . - < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > 
is cleaning 
goin to bed . loooong day tomorrow . gotta go to class . gotta go out to lunch with some of the girls from class & I gotta couple more hours of clincals ... so about a twelve hour day . ugh . 
-I started at the bottom , I'm finishin at the top- 
Getting ready , then venturing north to visit all my favorite Superiorites ! 
some things never change .... I just wonder if that's a good thing or a bad thing .... hmmmm 
playin < PROPMALE > potter on the wii . ha i'm cool . 
< PROPMALE > Tucker : A bit of breaking news . A local family is forced out of their home by ghosts . Who are they gonna call ? < PROPFEMALE > Simmons ( sighs ): Ghostbusters , < PROPMALE > . < PROPMALE > Tucker : No , < PROPFEMALE > . Their insurance company . That's just stupid what you said .

has a very big decision to make .... 
wishes it was two thirty . 
is it a bad thing that whenever someone suggests that I do something I always wannna do the opposite ? I don't always do the opposite but I do think about it . I'm beginning to think that I subconsicously crave dysfunction . Which is weird cause that's so not me . Although I could just be thinking too much , I tend to do that . 
just got done with work and am still hearing call lights and chair alarms in my head lol . gotta run some errands and get some things in order . 
Had a good day at work , was all excited to come home and be lazy , but it's too nice out for that . I'm thinkin about goin for a walk or maybe going on an adventure at Big Falls . Guess we'll see what happens ! 
thank god for starbucks . 
So much to do so little time . These visits home are always so hectic . 
Going to the park with Ellyse and little < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > . Then hangin out with the fam before heading back to EC . 
I hate it when I go to walmart , get home , then realize I forgot to get the main thing I went there for . 
I will buy you a garden , where your flowers can bloom I will buy you a new car , perfect shiny and new I will buy you that big house , way up in the west hills I will buy you a new life Yes , I will 
is enjoying my weekend off . 
today is a bad day .

-With my big black \ 
boots & old suitcase I do believe I'll find myself a new place I \ 
don't wanna be the bad guy I don't wanna do your sleepwalk dance anymore\ 
I just wanna see some palm trees I will try & shake away this \ 
disease--I'll walk right into a brand new day Insane & rising in \ 
my own weird way I don't wanna be the bad guy I don't wanna do your \ 
sleepwalk dance anymore I just wanna feel some sunshine- 
workin then coming home and passing out I need to catch up on sleep like you would not believe .

is going back to eau < PROPFEMALE > today . snap back to reality . 
I work in less than five hours and can't fall asleep to save my life . Thinkin I might as well stay up and just pass out after work tomorrow ... but I need sleep to function properly ... either way this is not going to be good or how I wanted to start off my nine day work streak ... ugh I hate it when this happens . 
Well ... I ended up pullin an all nighter , haven't done this in awhile but I got about a half a pot of coffee in me and I'm ready to work . Just hope my caffine don't wear off any time soon . lol . today should be interesting .

must i stub my toe on everything in my path ? lol besides the fact my toes have endured quite the beating this morning i'm in a surprisingly good mood . \ 
off to work should be a pretty laid back day but we shall see . \ 
\ 
-If you get a < PROPMALE > , take it . If it changes your life , let it . - 
I'm so official all I need is a whistle .

came so close to walking out of work . today is so stupid . 
watching some it's always < PROPFEMALE > in philadelphia will turn this day around 
is takin care of business . everyday . 
I know it feels like we just pissed away our history But just today I looked at your picture , almost hate to say I miss you subconsciously , wish it didn't have to end this way but I just had to get away , don't know why I don't know what else to say I guess I'm going through changes . 
oh boy work today was tiring and stressful . now i'm going to sit in this comfty chair and do nothing but read one of my favorite books . 
the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results . 
-but instead of feelin sorry for yourself do somethin about it , admit you gotta problem , your brain is clouded you pouted long enough it isn't them it's you quit worryin about what they do .. so i picked myself off the ground and fuckin swam before i drowned- 
Jim : I'm just saying you can't be sure that it wasn't \ 
you . \ 
Dwight : That's ridiculous . Of course it wasn't me . \ 
Jim : Marijuana is a memory loss drug . \ 
So maybe you\ 
just don't remember . \ 
Dwight : I would remember . \ 
Jim : How could you , if it just erased your \ 
memory ? \ 
Dwight : That's not how it works ! \ 
Jim : How do you know how it works ? \ 
Dwight : Knock it off ! 
Not everyone gets a second < PROPMALE > & I'm not going to blow mine . 
\Oh 
Days like this make me realize I will miss this town In my time here I have done very well 4 myself Ive set goals & acheived them & met some great ppl along the way As bittersweet as it will be 2 leave I know its best I need 2 prove 2 myself I can keep doin wat I have been wherever life takes me This will be the biggest test After this nothin will stop me Things can only go up cuz I won't let anythin knock me down 
is going to bed . working a double tomorrow . 6am- 10:30 pm . oh joy ! 
-and the people in the houses all went to the university , where they were put in boxes , and they came out all the same . and there's doctors and lawyers and business executives and they're all made out of ticky tacky and they all look just the same . - 
So I've done all the price checking for everything and all I need is $ 1,904 and I'll be on my way to The Wizarding World of < PROPMALE > Potter for a week . May not be anytime soon but I WILL make it there within the next couple years ! 
Heylia : U & < PROPMALE > ain't havin no more association . Not while I'm alive & kickin w/ my pointy shoes . \ 
Nancy : I don't understand , what did I do ? \ 
H : U brought out the stupid in him . Now I'm sure U didn't tell him \ 
to go down to that lil school & beat the tar outta lil mr. security \ 
guard but U blink those big brown eyes & there he go . & I can't \ 
have that . \ 
N : U did that ? \ 
H : Who U think done it ? The fuck-U-up < PROPFEMALE > ? 
-I'm just a highly intelligent under acheiver . & that works for me . 
\Air conditioning ! \ 
can't afford to be a lame-o in this day and age and in this stage of the game mediocrity can no longer be allowed to fly -- 
Common sense is surprisingly uncommon . 
As hard as we try to move forward , as tempting as it is to never look back , history has shown us again and again those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it . 
It's a good thing i automatically wake up at quarter to five cuz my alarm decided to turn itself off ... again . But it's also kinda sad cuz it reminds me that my days of sleeping til noon are over ... 
There comes a point in your life when you realize who matters , who never did , who won't anymore , and who always will . So don't worry about people from your past , there's a reason they didn't make it to your future . 
can't believe i only have one more shift at syverson . :( first job i've had that i'll actually miss . this week really snuck up on me . 
I miss the Chappellle show . 
U ask How can I leave it all behind if I am coming back to it ? How can I make a new beginning if I return to the old ? The answer is in the return . U won't come back to the same thing . What u return to has changed becuz u have changed . Ur perception will be altered , u won't fall into the same status or world u left . The river has been flowing while u were gone , now it is not the same river . 
hittin up redzone && water street for my last night in EC yeah < PROPMALE > :)

I worked very hard to get where I'm at && I couldn't be happier :) 
Well hello financial aid check , you just made my day . 
-Save your breath or state your case , speak your mind and be on your way cause I don't have time for the games you play . 
fool me once shame on you , fool me twice shame on me . 
They told me I was average but I just couldn't accept that .
