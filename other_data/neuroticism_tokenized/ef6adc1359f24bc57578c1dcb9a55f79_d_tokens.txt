I'M TOO MUCH A GAMBLER TO LET THE FATE/GOD BE MY DEALER .

< PROPMALE > class . 
Good Luck to all AP Bioers/ists

Seeing happy AP Bioers/ists makes me feel happy . 
Am I right to tell that person what I'm thinking ? I don't want to regret not telling . 
As some girl has said , something is better left unchanged 
My jaw muscle got sore for smiling too much thanks to everyone who took pictures of mine tonight . This means to be a nice compliment . 
will go to school tomorrow and \say farewell\ " to some \ " ladies\ " and \ " gentlemen\ " in 7th period " 
Missions accomplished ( yes it's plural )

Internet is down ; i think i might be blind and deaf , but no . I get engaged in more meaningful activities . Suddenly , i realize that digital technology is not what many of my age believe : food and air of 21st century . \ 
( Some thoughts after 2 non-internet days ) 
Farewell and thank you\ 
_To my parents : for educating me the hard way and the soft way . \

Shakespeare's \Richard III\ " was so good at Shakespeare & Company theater . \

College Quiz Bowl Tournament at Brown University summary :\ 
1st : Harvard A ( 440-435 in the final match vs Yale A\ 
2nd : Yale A\ 
< PROPMALE>'s postion is unknown to me - we ( yes , I was in the team ) won 6/11 matches ( lost to Harvard A , Yale B , U . Penn A , Columbia A and Brown ; won over U . Penn B , U of Connecticut A & B , Brandeis A & B , and Columbia B ) 
Found the TV show he watched 12 years ago on the internet . 
My wonderful dorm-mate < PROPFEMALE > taught me to play violin . 
( Collected from the Internet ) Comment on the first 1TB optical disc made by TDK :\ 
\Today we have reached a new milestone ! We have a disk with enough space \ 
loves beef jerky with fat strips 
Screw Dance = Blind Date ? Good idea 
can play part of \Twinkle twinkle little star\ " with his violin " 
So I waked up at 6:15 , meditated till 6:45 , practiced violin till 7:15 , then had a 1-hr breakfast . What a weekend morning . 
Today , I coached my dorm entry's intramural soccer team . It was a rough start , but it'll be alright . 
Snow ! Or is it hail that looks like snow ? 
Looking forward to next Thursday - the 1st snow day according to weather forecast . 
Naruto Shippuuden Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 - amazing ! 
Notice how his friends got hectic again about < PROPMALE > Potter : they do all kinds of related quiz and change their profile pictures . 
Let's vote - why do you think I am a nerd ? ( Unfortunately , I want to know the identity of the voter)\ 
a ) I look like one ( appearance)\ 
b ) I am studious/get good grades/etc . \ 
c ) I am an Asian with glasses\ 
d ) I behave awkwardly sometimes\ 
e ) You're jealous of me\ 
f ) Other reason\ 
This post was inspired by one of my friend who consistently calls me nerd for apparently no reason . 
is under a lot of stress . 
is one of the very few things still moving around in Armstrong 2 entry . 
The whole college is seemingly a deserted campus . Except at the dining hall , I saw only 2-3 people . And in the dorm , there was no one . Kinda freaking . 
Because all dining halls were closed and the only open restaurant's menu did not look appealing to me I made my own Thanksgiving dinner - Vermicelli noodle with mushroom and turkey plus scramble egg with the same ingredient ~ hot , nutritional , and traditional-ish . 
It's snowing , right now . 
hope that my plan for Christmas ( not Winter Break ) will not be ruined by the finals . 
\[ ... ] happiness and sadness often arise merely from changing one's point of view 
That was stunning : about 15 naked < PROPMALE > students ( male as well as female ) run across the Schow Library the night before final exam period . 
Finished the ************************** paper at 3:30 am . 
Two things made me ecstatic today :\ 
_ I got an A for my French literature class ( predicted ) . \ 
_ My chemistry final's score is much better than any of my chem . midterm - about 15% raise ( totally blew my mind out of my brain ) . 
Stayed up until 1 am to talk with his bro's . :) 
is back home from work and fails to come up with an idea for Christmas e-card ; nevertheless , < PROPFEMALE > Christmas , everyone . 
Money , it must be \funny in the < PROPMALE > man's world . \"" 
It seems to be a trend that animated movies are made funny by side characters ; e.g : Dory in Finding Nemo , Maximus and Pascal in Tangled . 
The snow is heavy , and the class is cancelled . 
am on Death Squad's list right now ; my KAOS life is numbered in hours or even minutes . 
@A2 entry : please disregard the message I sent you ( it was sent a week ago , but it took the admin 1 week to approve of it ) . However , check out those movie trailers . 
watched an inspirational but superficial State of the Union plus a brainwashing and fact-and-opinion-fused reply of a creepy Rep. that contributes nothing to the sake of the nation . 
First time in Boston , first time taking subway , and first time ice skating - all with my friend , Tuang . 
If you want your kids to love science take them to Boston Museum of Science . 
How I justified my dropping of a class :\ 
1 . The class material is easy\ 
2 . The skills learned here can be learned in my another class\ 
3 . The professor is brand new - her < PROPMALE > compatibility is not verified\ 
4 . The class size makes seminar format inapplicable\ 
... \ 
99 . I have to wake up early\ 
100 . My entry-mates also have class at that time and crowd the common restroom . 
Yesterday was my best day so far this year :) 
What to do for < PROPFIRST>'s day , provided that it is heavily commercialized and possesses no spirit of love ? Maybe I should do some handcraft gifts , maybe . 
At the start of my last Physiology class , my ( male ) professor , seemingly hyperventilated , exclaimed : \Oh my God 
love the smell of burning gun powder and metal salts 
I will never take a philosophy class because I believe that every doctrine/ principle/ etc . is just an attempt to express certain conscious and unconscious aspects of human's mind that can never manifest their true nature . 
Although all born with equivalent genetic features and equipped with the same work ethics , some are underprivileged and some are overprivileged . Such gap in economic background is the motivation for upward social mobility and , at the same time , the burden prolonging itself . One who fails to realize this may have a hard time resolve the inferior mentality about oneself . 
So I walk back to my dorm , run through all corridors , yelling and cursing to rooms now only occupied by darkness and silence .
