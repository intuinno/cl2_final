For it was not into my ear you whispered , but into my heart . It was not my lips you kissed , but my soul . 
Have compassion for all beings , < PROPMALE > and poor alike ; each has their suffering . Some suffer too much , others too little .

Eugh , throwing up all night and not being able to sleep is NOT a fun thing , let me tell you . T___T 
? Anata wo itsumo yume ni mite , sono hitomi sae totemo natsukashii ... ? 
? The self-denial I keep repeating . As if it were my trademark . All I ever wanted was to hear the single phrase - [ I need you ] . ? 
Be < PROPMALE > undisputed , Respected , saluted , And seen for the wonder I am ! Yes , my teeth and ambitions are bared . Be prepared ! 
My faith in this world- is a bottle of nothing , I know . Still I fly ... Still I fall ... 
Working at SpaVana til probably 5 . :] I'm so tireddd .. 
Meh , the only way I can get a refil on my perscriptions is if I go to counciling . Superrrr ~ T__T ;;; God kill me . 
Just took a trip to M.A.C and bought maddd makeup after a night of playing < PROPFEMALE > Crocker for the going away-brownies-and-cake-palooza . & hearts ; 
Today was a good day . <3 
? Studies show : Intelligent girls are more depressed because they know what the world is really like . ? 
Working at SpaVana . ^^ Fighting the tiredness . 
Bored out of my wits . T__T ;;; Someone text me or something . Ahaha 
I hate knowing that we could be perfect , only to find out that you don't feel the same ... 
Halloween was fun . I'm so exhausted . =/ 
I want a perfect body , I want a perfect soul . I want you to notice when I'm not around . You're so fucking special . I wish I was special ... But I'm a creep ... 
My faith in this world , is a bottle of nothing , I know ... 
I start to think there really is no cure for depression , that happiness is an ongoing battle , and I wonder if it isn't one I'll have to fight for as long as I live . I wonder if it's worth it . 
For I am shamed by that which I bring forth , and so should you , to love things nothing worth . 
Bored ( as fuck ) . Let's do something today ? Maybe mall it up a bit ? 
In seeking wisdom thou < PROPMALE > wise ; in imagining that thou hast attained it - thou < PROPMALE > a fool . 
? A domesticated girl thats all you ask of me . Darling it is no joke this is lycanthropy . The < PROPFEMALE>'s awake now with eyes wide open . . . ? 
Good night of hanging at the mall with Trash , Pumpkin , and < PROPFEMALE > and getting groped the entire evening . Ahaha <3 
Another dead girl on the tube Shes my < PROPFEMALE > Munster crawling from her tomb Dark black circles around her eyes Cold dead lips and a crooked spine Shes the living dead , shes a ghoulish fiend Shes the deadest girl of my dreams . . . 
Is watching The < PROPMALE > Horror Picture show . :3 
Are the bones of your sins sharp enough to cut through your own excuses ? 
Have you traveled far ? Are you made of stardust too ? Are the angels after you ? Tell me what I am to do . . . 
>////< Can't seem to get < PROPMALE > Cloud out of her mind ... <3<3 
? My hands are searching for you . My arms are outstretched towards you . I feel you on my fingertips . My tongue dances behind my lips for you . . . ? 
Eyebrow is pierced successfully ! :3 
Studies show : Intelligent girls are more depressed Because they know What the world is really like Don’t think for a beat it makes it better When you sit her down and tell her Everything gonna be all right She knows in society she either is A devil or an angel with no in between She speaks in the third person So she can forget that she’s ME . 
Christmas is the worst holiday ever . Fuck it . It's materalistic and the commercialism is ridiculous . Is it over yet ? 
I seriously need a new purse . I'm getting sick of the fact that all my stuff falls out if it falls over for the lack of zipper . T__T ;

Hmmm ... bored , listening to The Hustle again ... probably gonna go have me a cigarette before making some pizza roll thingies . Mmmm <3 
And I wonder , do you realize how deeply your words hurt me ? Doubt is a pain too lonely to know that faith is his twin brother . 
When the obsession with death , becomes a way of life . 
Tuckered out . Time to shower , than to Kevins . * yawwwwn *

And the weird thing was , I was the only one freaking out about it ! [ Hyde , Fez , and Kelso start to laugh ] < PROPFIRST > : Wait a minute . Good year ? It was a terrible year , man !

Is it ironic that everytime I go for a cigarette I lose my lighter and come to find it in my bra ? It's the same way with my phone . You'd think I would learn by now ?! xD 
Dance with me below < PROPFEMALE > knives . Chandeliers ablaze . We'll dance in fear of our own lives that our eyes contain . Behind these masks we renegade against the sound . We'll let our voices slowly fade and ring out . ?

It's such a nice day out ~ :] 
You think that you’ll get by . You will die . You will cry . When you think that you’ll survive . Just don’t try . Run and hide . My eyes are hollow like my soul ...? 
Why live a life . That’s painted with pity . And sadness and strife . Why dream a dream . That’s tainted with trouble . And less than it seems . Why bother bothering . Just for a poem . Or another sad song to sing . Why live a life . Why live a life . 
Thanks to watching the < PROPMALE > Jr. show , Little Bear all yesterday , I've come to the conclusion that today , I am making cheese cake and lots of tea ! :D 
The older you get , the better you get , unless you're a banana . 
[ Sophia enters kitchen ] Dorothy : You couldn't sleep either , huh ? Sophia : No , I'm sleeping so good I thought I'd come try it in the sink . 
You know what they say : you can lead a herring to water , but you have to walk really fast or he'll die . 
OMFG . Fucking creepy guys texting me randomly . NO you are a creepy pedophille who sent dirty pics to my friend at work . I will NOT talk to you , creeper . FML

Thinking about taking tonight to write a bit . My < PROPMALE > Horror fanfiction needs some updating . D: It's been a month ... chapter eight shall be in the makes ! :D 
Awwww . T__T This sucks . RIP < PROPFIRST > Haim 
I Long For A Loss Of Breath And A Most Dire Predicament- Murders In The Rue Morgue . Silence And Shadow's , What I Adore . 
You play the victim very well . You build yourself indulgent hell . You wanted someone to understand you , well be careful what you wish for because I do . 
I'm fucking sick of your pathetic pretentious ways . If the spotlight isn't on you , you throw a bitch fit and make a fool of your friends to make yourself feel better . I truly feel sorry for you . 
Words have no power to impress the mind without the exquisite horror of their reality . 
The boundaries which divide Life from Death are at best shadowy and vague . Who shall say where the one ends , and where the other begins ? 
\Trust is like a mirror . You can fix it if it's broken . But you can still see the cracks in that motherfucking reflection . \"" 
I'm not much of a man , by the light of day , but by night I'm one hell of a lover ! I'm just a sweet transvestite , from Transexual , Transylvaniaaaaa !!! 
Today is a day to be productive ! Today is a day to be creative ! Too bad that I am also quite lethargic ... maybe I'll force some creativity out ... maybe ... 
Hmmmm , getting off the computer for the night , tried to write , and couldn't . Instead I read < PROPFEMALE > Mahoney's fanfic . :O I can't believe she's preggo ! :OOOO Well , at least reading gave me some inspiration . Tomorrow ! Tomorrow I shall write ! :DDD 
It is time ... to write ! :D Eugh , I just hope I don't get distracted again like last night . xDD I ended up drawing an epic picture only to ruin it miserably with ink . T_____T fml 
\It's not easy having a good time . Even smiling makes my face ache . \"" 
Had the most beautiful dream about < PROPFEMALE > Autumn last night because I was reading her autobiography before bed . <3333 ^/////////^ She's so perfect . 
I want my innocence back And if you can't pacify me I will break your bones You think I'm bluffing , just try me I will never forget The words you used to ensnare me Till my dying day You'll suffer for this , I swear . 
While I thought that I was learning how to live , I have been learning how to die . 
I live in sin , to kill myself I live . No longer my life my own , but sin's . My good is given to me by heaven , my evil by myself -- by my free will ; of which I am deprived . ~ Michelangelo 
Listening to some Led Zeppelin . :D 
Be zen like < PROPFIRST > Hyde . 
I was really meaning to go out and plant some wildflowers but the life has been sucked out of me . DDD: Damnnit . * Jams to Led Zeppelin - Whole Lotta love *

I wish I was little so I could put rain boots and a yellow coat with hat and play in the puddles ~ And I want thunder and lightening !!!!

Maybe if I bash my skull hard enough against my keyboard , I'll get a concussion and not have to go to school for 4 1/2 hours ? God kill me , now . 
Ugh . Going to work then i has school . Wish i had room for a nap . Haha text meee . :) 
With forgiveness , your victim identity dissolves , and your true power emerges - the power of presence . Instead of blaming the darkness you bring in the light . 
I'm not your chambermaid . You're not my lord . All the fine games we played have left me bored . I never want to see you come around my castle , ' cause I just can't afford to love you . I'm not your chambermaid . You're not my lord . 
Apparently i'm pirate < PROPMALE > Marley ... ha . -guzzles rum while sitting on her ship with her rasta hat on , smoking a blunt-

Guess I'm not going to the gym afterall . :[ This sucks . Ah well , I'm gonna go walk my doggy then . I refuse to stay inside all day , damnit ! >.< Maybe I'll plant some flowers too ! :D 
Kenan : Kel , grab a clown , a flagpole , and a submarine , and meet me in my room ! Come on , Buffalo Bottoms ! Kel : Kenan , how am I gonna < PROPFEMALE > all of that stuff ? Well , I guess I could put the clown and the flagpole inside the submarine , but it still SEEMS RATHER DIFFICULT ! Aww , here it goes ! 
And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune then the < PROPFEMALE > will lead us to reason . And a new day will < PROPFEMALE > for those who stand long . And the forests will < PROPFEMALE > with laughter . 
I'm the kind to sit up in his room , heartsick and eyes filled up with blue , I don't know what you've done to me but I know this much is true , I wanna do bad things with you . 
Danzig and applejacks . :3 Life is good ~ 
Death is but a dream , I know . . . Dolls were meant to throw away- all broken and bent from petty play . My faith in this world is a bottle of nothing . Still I fly . Still I fall . . . Mad girl . . . 
Being jealous is kind of pointless when i could really care less . 
I want my innocence back and if you can't pacify me I will break your bones , you think I'm bluffing , just try me . I will never forget the words you used to ensnare me . Till my dying day , you'll suffer for this , I swear . 
I'm thinking about changing my entire look . I already know I'm dying my hair like three different colors buttt ... I'm thinking about getting snakebites and a nose ring . Maybeeee . . . 
I can't explain just how it feels . The thoughts of my premature burial . Inside this oblong box I lie , with the hopes I'll be buried alive . ? 
Toking it . ;) 5 days until 4:20 ! <3 
TMNT then sleep . <3 I love < PROPMALE > ! 
Party for < PROPMALE>'s birthday with < PROPFIRST > tonight . :) woot ! :3

Just like the < PROPFEMALE > does , we rise and shine and fall , Victims , aren't we all ? 
Woke up to a wicked bad toothache . Damn you wisdom teeth , I thought your reign of terror was over with years ago !

Sitting around not doing anything after a wonderful day shopping . Hit me up . :) 5084887604 
I love < PROPFEMALE > . <333 
Death is but a dream , i know . My faith in this world is a bottle of nothing . . . 
Throwing up after accidentally eating meat really sucks . I feel like there's a lead ball in my stomach and i just want to die . 
</3 
The screams of plauge and suicide fill my fortress of insanity . I'll burn in the flames of my sins . 
Don't listen to anyone . Avatar was really good ! Not amazing like the cartoon but still worth watching . :) 
The only thing that's even real are the feelings that i don't feel . 
It's raining ! <333333333333333333 
Feeling incredibly nostaligic and dejected as of late . ._. Meh . 
Tu fui , ego eris - What you are , I was . What I am , you will be . . . 
Text me to make plans today . :) 
Sleeping over < PROPFEMALE>'s . Work 2:30 - 9:30 tomorrow . :3 Text it in the a.m. 
No phone for a while . Going to be putting even more money on it to see if anything happens . Ughh ... prepaid was simpler . lol 
My phone is back on ! :D text me to make plans ! <3 
Is it weird that listening to 80s glam rock pumps and cheers me up ? :o lol

Look what time it is ! :D 
God . Life is boring . :( 
< PROPFEMALE > Autumn at the Armory on 10/22/10 . Who wants to go with me ?!?! 
Who has 84 dollars and would be willing to let me borrow it until next week when I get paid on Friday ?? I would sell you my soul . I MUST GET < PROPFEMALE > Autumn VIP tickets ! >_____< 
Vip tickets are apparently sold out now . . . -drowns in sadness- 
That man's gonna be my death death because he's all i ever wanted in my life . And i know he doesn't know my name And that all the girls are all the same to him . 
Twenty five days in-counting til vegas ! Yay ! Ugh . So tired from last night . -yawn- work 2:30 til 9:30 tonight . 
No pain , inside . You're my protection . But how do i feel this good sober ? 
I really need someone to cheer me up today . Let's go out tonight ? Text it . 
In sleepless nights , a never ending dream and sweet wine . My scars had begun to fade . I'll lift my glass to a bitter past and bid it [ goodbye ] . 
I wish love was like a\ 
volleyball . When you say “MINE , ” everyone would back off , and the ball\ 
would be all yours . But it is not , because love is like a basketball . \ 
Everyone’s aiming for it . And if you don’t know how to hold the ball\ 
well , others will steal it from you . 
What was your first impression of me/what do you think now ? :D lol I'm curious ! If you reply , I'll return the favor ~ 
My accidental happily ever after . The way you smile and how you comfort me , with your laughter . You're the best thing i never knew i needed . . . 
Meditating before work . Wish me luck i don't freak out on certain lazy people . :) must be zen . 
Almost off work . Thank gosh . Lol anyone wanna do something after 9 thirty ? :) 
Working at < PROPFEMALE>'s really makes me cynical . The ignorance and rudeness of our customers is frightening . Really , if you're going to ask my advice and proceed to purchase the opposite , you deserve to have your hair fall out . -sigh- 
It's going to be a great day , i made it out of the shower without drowning . :) 
Victims , aren't we all ? 
Is lonely . :( someone come cuddle me to sleep ~ <3 
Going to the Patriots training camp and then to the car show . :) yay ! Today's going to be lovely ~ 
Ah ! Man , am i sleepy . Long fun day . Sweet bed , i know i left you this morning , could you ever take me back ? </3 lol 
Sitting around not doing much . Maybe i'll go for a walk ! Nature , how i love thee ~ 
She had a corpse under her bed . She had her fun but now he's dead . Her momma said , come feed < PROPFEMALE > . Her brother said , hey throw it on the fire ! 
Amazing night last night . :3 Hopefully tomorrow will bring the same . <3 
Time to retire to my coffin for the night . Might as well and -try- to sleep . Work in the AM 11- 6:30 , then nothinggg ~ Make plans with me , and we shall conquer the world ! :D 
Free tonight and tomorrow , then friday . Make plans with me before i'm gone [ to vegas ] . 
Watching the day break and fighting the urge to sleep , cause my dreams won't let this die . All i can see and hear in the dark is you . And it's hard to breathe cause all i feel when i do is this aching heart . 
Nothing is miserable unless you think it is so . 
Smoking a cigarette before I go out to eat with my dearest < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > . YAY ! <3 
Driving around with < PROPFEMALE > , blasting Total eclipse of the heart . Epic ? I think so . 
Terribly bored . Working til close each night this week . Free friday . Who wants to chill ? 
Watching the < PROPFEMALE > girls <3 
Making some rice with tea before I go into work today . 2:30 - 9:30 . :{ Want to make plannnss afterward ? :3 
Stroll down the runway . Another pay day . Cover of magazines , and when they see me , they wanna be me . I am the fantasy . Cover girl . Put the bass in your walk . Head to toe let your whole body talk . 
My neck is so stiff . :( i needs massage . Ow . Or a new neck . :3 
Kill me romantically , fill my soul with vomit and ask me for a piece of gum . Bitter and dumb , you're my sugar plum . You're awful , i love you . 
Quoted from < PROPFIRST > Ostapchuk : \I'm not looking for an easy lay . I'm looking for that true love bullshit that no one seems to believe in anymore . \ " Word . " 
Everything is spiralling out of my control , and i don't like it . . . I need something or someone to keep me sane . One person to keep me grounded . Nearly at my wits end yet i continue to try so hard to do what is expected of me . Idk anymore . . . 
Just because you don't care what happens to YOUR job , doesn't mean that those of us who do should pay for your mistakes . It's called pride , bitch . Get some . 
Home after a bad day . Doing laundry while listening to the fabulous Rupaul . Fourteen days till i get to see my Baylie in vegas ! 
That man's gonna be my death cause he's all i ever wanted in my life . And i know he doesn't know my name and that , all the girls are all the same to him . Still i gotta get outta this place cause i don't think i can face another night , where i'm half sick of shadows , and i can see the sky . . . 
Who wants me tomorrow ? [ to < PROPFEMALE > out with , pervs ] . ;) 
I want you to notice when i'm not around , you're so fucking special , i wish i was special , but i'm a creep . I'm a weirdo . . . 
Sleeping in will be great tomorrow . :3 Goodnight all . 
Rawr ! Been up for about an hour and a half . Not doing much . Hit me up on the cellie ~ :3 
I fucking hate making plans and then they not being there and leaving me fucking stranded . Don't own a cell if you're not going to answer . Fuck . 
You tell me everything's alright as though it's something you've been through . You think this torment is romantic- well it's not , except to you . . . 
Every night i burn , every night i call your name . Every night i fall , every night the dream's the same . . . 
Hopefully today will be a good one . -fingers crossed- 
Ugh . . . I hate having to impose and ask , but can anyone give me a ride to work tomorrow for two o clock ? I have no ride . . 
Silent Hill <3 
I don't know what you've done to me but i know this much is true , i wanna do bad things to you . . . 
At work , off at four thirty . Today . . . I'm feeling a nap . :) 
Physically and mentally drained . Nap time , feel free to text . 
The < PROPMALE > of suicide , nightgowns and hair , curls flying every which where . The pain too pure to hide , bridges of sighs , meant to conceal lover's lies . . ? 
Sure , \ 
I talk to myself , and willingly admit it . It doesn't mean I'm crazy ... \ 
just that I appreciate intelligent conversations and know where to find\ 
one ;) 
I'm feeling chatty . Im me at xvampiriclament :) 
Who's up to chillin Thursday ? :D 
Oh dearest bed , why must i leave your warm embrace ? 
Nothing to do . Hit me up ! :) 5084887604 
One more black line will ease that limb away . Mind destroying angel made your judgment sway . Exsanguination left you insane ( but it's ) Hard to use an axe when you ain't got hands . 
Workin til two thirty today :) then chillin . 
Cruising with < PROPFIRST > tonight ! :) 
Happy Friday the 13th ! <3

Wants to do para para really bad ! Lmao 
I'm trapped in this world , lonely and fading , heartbroke and waiting for you to come . We are stuck in this world , that's not meant for me . 
Ugh , so depressed I spent so much money . T__T Sublime was amazing though ! 
Not doing anything really today , maybe I'll pack ? Hmmm ... but first ! Time for a little smokey smokey ;) lol Jammin to < PROPMALE > Marley . :3 
Yes , it's all false love & affection . You don't want me , you just like the attention .

Drinking a screwdriver , listening to techno . <3 Vegas is awesome , I don't wanna leaveeeeeeee ~ :{ 
\You better watch your diva before I check your diva . \ " xDD LOL <3 " 
Use your smile to change the world ; don't let the world change your smile . 
Make plans with me !!!!! :D I'm home from Vegas now . :] Phone got shut off , so the only way to contact me is through fb or calling my house phone [ 774-203-3330 ] . 
Working . :3 i miss having a cell phoneeeee 
About to smoke some salvia and meditate . :] Be zen , my friends ; don't let the small things obscure the big picture . 
There is nothing heavier than compassion . Not even\ 
one's own pain weighs so heavy as the pain one feels for someone ; for\ 
someone , pain intensified by the imagination and prolonged by a hundred\ 
echos . 
Listening to NIN covers on youtube . * Yawn * I just woke up , mannn , am I tired . T___________T 
Uploading vegas pictures while I go get showered up for an adventurous day with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > & < PROPMALE > Shockroo . W000t . 
I dont think you trust in my self righteous suicide . . . 
Depression is not a sign of weakness , it is just a sign that we have been strong for far too long . 
New phone & # . 508 333 9625 . Text me with your name . 
Hey guys , I think I gave you the wrong number . My new number is : 5083330625

You should have known the price of evil . And it hurts to know that you belong here . It's your fucking nightmareee ... 
So I was told I had a beautiful < PROPFEMALE > tonight . :3 made me happy and realize it's true , and whomever takes me for granted is stupid . 
Today's going to be a lonnnng day . Couldn't sleep last night cause I kept coughing . -sigh- time to put on a happy faceee ~ 
Just got out of work . Doing a piercing , then nothing . Hit me up . ;)

Four cough medicine pills later . . . Blahhhh . This better only be allergies . Sleepy , might go back to sleep . :/ 
Perhaps I am hyper-sensitive ... but perhaps this world just doesn't give two shits as well , either way , at the end of the day , I know < PROPFEMALE > is on my side . :3 
Feels so ... lifeless . It's like my body is awake , but everything else is dead . Ah well , work til 9 30 . 
I've been waiting for the day I will surely die , and a tear for i've been told , that i'll die before i'm old , and the wind I know is cold . .

Let's < PROPFEMALE > out ! We can go to the park and lay iin the sun . :3 
As they said , the ones who dared to walk into their territory got trapped in their ghoulish games lost forever , they could not find a way out or maybe drowned in the dark and cold waters of the treacherous rivers that bathed their lands or turned to stone for a hundred years . Welcome to my world . 
No matter how long we exist , we have our memories . Points in time which time itself cannot erase . Suffering may distort my backward glances , but even to suffering , some memories will yield nothing of their beauty or their splendor . Rather they remain as hard as gems . 
Goodnight sweet < PROPMALE > , may flights of devils wing you to your rest ... 
I think for Halloween , I want to be < PROPFIRST > Draven ( ie . The Crow ) . :] 
God damn , I miss having funky coloured hair . :[ It's so odd to have my NATURAL hair back , for once . Eeesh . 
As\ 
they said , the ones who dared to walk into their territory got trapped\ 
in their ghoulish games lost forever , they could not find a way out or\ 
maybe drowned in the dark and cold waters of the treacherous rivers\ 
that bathed their lands or turned to stone for a hundred years . Welcome\ 
to my world . 
Going to the gym then contemplating piercing my dimples . HmmMmMmm ... 
Getting my crow wings tattoo on my back . Wicked pumped !! Next week !!! 
These animals , they operate on jealousy and lust ; I'm taking back what was lost . And I will not be denied , I'm crawling my way to the surface outside . . . 
And that , ladies and gentlemen , is the miracle of < PROPFEMALE > . :] I am happy . 
Ashes to ashes , bones to paste ; you'll wither away in your resting place . Eternity in a wooden case , we all fall down ! 
Abashed the Devil stood and felt how awful goodness is . 
I'm coldddd . :{ Come cuddle meeeee ~~~< 3 
-Yawnnn- Just woke up , ugh , so cold . Time for tea ! ;D 
Making spaghetti with sugar snap peas , roasted potatoes , red peppers & garlic < PROPMALE > . I'm going to make a good wifey , someday . :p lol 
I don't care if people stare , i'd rather boogie then try and fit in . ;] 
Tryin to get my 7/16 tapers in . Owowowowow ow . 
Party at < PROPFEMALE>'s tomorrowww ~ ~ rawr , I think the sleep fairies want me to retire early tonight . Night night <33 
I work at a beauty supply store and I have no < PROPFIRST > pins ! WTF .

Home for the night . Who wants to chillll ? :3 
Jammin to combichrist , sitting on my porch smokin a cigg . Gawd , give me something to do . D: 
La < PROPFEMALE > es < PROPFEMALE > . <3 
People fear death even moe than pain . It's strange that they fear death . Life hurts a lot more than death . At the point of death , the pain is over . 
You know the fuck what ? I don't give two flying fucks whether you want to be my friend anymore , ' sugar ' . All you are is a melodramatic FUCK . I'm done appologizing . So farewell , and fuck you . <3 
Going to the gym . :) yay !

Homeee at last . Feel free to hit me up if you wanna chill , dearies ! ;) 
I wish I still had my painting stuff . I'm feeling creativeeee !! :D rawrr .

Today feels like it's goung to be a bad day , I can sense it . Eughh , fml . I -will- make the best of it . 
Things did get better . :) off at four . 
Faith is a journey , not a guilt trip . 
Studying up on body language , I really want to be more observant and such . >.< lol 
The greatest degree of inner tranquility comes from the development of\ 
love and compassion . The more we care for the happiness of others , the\ 
greater is our own sense of well-being . 
Sooo , I lost my wallet . If i've < PROPMALE > out with you since sunday , could you check for me ? 
I totally don't want to close with Bitchzilla today . Ah well , money is money , right ?

I wake in terror\ 
Blackbirds screaming\ 
Dark cathedrals spilling\ 
Midnight on their alters\ 
I'm your servant\ 
My immortal\ 
Pale and perfect\ 
Such unholy heaving\ 
The statues close their eyes\ 
The room is changing\ 
Break my skin\ 
And drain me

To all of my close friends I haven't kept in contact with , I'm sorry , life's been crazy =/ I haven't been able to be the friend you all deserve . 
This time baby , i'll be , bulletproof . 
And falling's just another way to fly , I wonder why it's never easier than the first time . . 
Is becoming increasingly sickened by the constant routine that has plauged my life . I need adventure , damnit 
Watching Dr. < PROPFIRST > , Medicine Woman ; then spending the night with my bbyy <33 :3 
The only people for me\ 
are the mad ones , the ones who are mad to live , mad to talk , mad to be\ 
saved , desirous of everything at the same time , the ones who never\ 
yawn or say a commonplace thing , but burn , burn , burn , like\ 
fabulous yellow < PROPMALE > candles exploding like spiders across the\ 
stars ... 
Wants to find some sexy Native American-esque fringed knee-high boots . T__T Is only finding ugly costume-y stuff . :[ Boooo . 
Watching the Pats game while piercing my ears . Weeee ~~~ !! 
Wants to touch up her roots , but has no energy to do so . Damn . 
And i'm crazy but you like it , loca , loca , loca ... 
~ I’m not for you\ 
You’re not for me\ 
I’ll kill you first\ 
You wait and see\ 
You devil undercover\ 
You’re not a prince\ 
You’re not a friend\ 
You’re just a child\ 
And in the end\ 
You’re one more selfish lover ~ 
Just like the < PROPFEMALE > does , we rise & shine & fall- over you that I rise & shine & crawl , Victims aren't we all ?

Love the earth and sun and animals , despise riches , give alms to everyone that asks , stand up for the stupid & crazy . Devote your income and labor to others and your very flesh shall be a great poem . 
A very great vision is needed & the man who has it must follow it as the eagle seeks the deepest blue of the sky . 
I want desperately to sit in a nice warm grassy field and read Walt Whitman :3 
Birds sing after a storm ; why shouldn't people feel as free to delight in whatever remains to them ? 
Come on baby light my fire .

Bahahaha made my ringback tone < PROPFEMALE > Autumn - Shallot . Go t-mobile ! Expand your music tastes ! :D * dances * 
My hands are tied\ 
The billions shift from side to side\ 
And the wars go on with brainwashed pride\ 
For the love of God and our human rights\ 
And all these things are swept aside\ 
By bloody hands time can't deny\ 
And are washed away by your genocide\ 
And history hides the lies of our civil wars\ 
( Tired of hearing about how death is bringing us back together as a nation ) . 
Getting ready for work now . :{ Bahhh * wants to enjoy the beautiful day , not be cooped up inside a building * xD Ah well , responsibilities are just that ! Must do what I gotta do to bring money in . =/
