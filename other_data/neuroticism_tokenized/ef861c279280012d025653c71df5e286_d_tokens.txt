Part of it already has and that was just 8th grade , how much will highschool tear out of my soul and my heart ?!? How many more friends will i lose ?!? Mom , get on , if the oil is in Florida im thinking i might as well stay here a lil longer . 
AND I HAVE NO ONE TO TALK TOO ! UGHHHHHHHH !!!!! 
sorry I haven't been on , i've been a little busy . 
I'm thinking about redecorating my room when I get home ...... pretty sure I will actually .... 
I think I may get my cartilage pierced left ear twice .... maybe ..... I'll see . I've wated a second and third ear piercing for a while and the friends I've talked to who had it done say it doesn't hurt to bad , and the risks are alot lower when they use a needle instead of a gun . plus the healing time is the usual . 3-6 month . maybe ... talk to the rents about it first 
oops , correct terminology for an ear cartilage piercing is a helix . And btw I am NOT under any circumstances getting an Industrial thank you very much . -sigh- hopeully my mom will aggree . Not that big a deal though .... 
it's to bad it's to bad it's to late so wrong so long . ok i gonna gt some sleep now night night , actually its amost 5 am but still .

I see I see the hurt in your eyes , the hurt in your eyes , dont let the track marks in your arms speak more loudly than you heart evrybody knows that you've been so lost , you find yourself on the edge of earth . I still beleive it's true , ohhhh oohhhhoh oh oh , letting go is all we need to do , and find your heart ...... 
I dont mind spending everyday , out on your corner in the pouring rain look for the girl with the broken smile , ask her if she wants to stay a while ...

In my eyes , in disposed , In disguise : as no one knows\ 
Hides the face Lies \ 
The snake , the sun \ 
In my disgrace\ 
Boiling heat , Summer stench\ 
' Neath the black\ 
The sky looks dead\ 
Call my name\ 
Through the cream\ 
And I'll hear you\ 
Scream again\ 
Black hole sun\ 
Won't you come\ 
And wash away the rain Black hole sun\ 
Stuttering\ 
Cold and damp\ 
Steal the warm wind\ 
Tired friend\ 
Times are gone\ 
For honest men

Reading a book called The Lies of Locke Lamora , it sounds fantastic , and so far it's amazing . I've heard alot of good things about the author , so when I saw the article posted about this book on mookychick I decided to read it . 
move in now move out ! Hands up now hands down Back up Back up tell me what you're gonna do now . Breath in now breath out . The lyrics aren't supposed to be meaningfull . They're supposed to draw out emotions . Rollin = Kick someone's but and keep movin on . My Way = well , simple . Let me get my way , or leave . I <3 this band because they're so obnoxious . 
Going bowling and out to eat tonight , should be fun , but could end up being disasterous ....... =] we shall see

OK . I got the awesome teachers . Cates , Bartel , and the new Algebra 1 honors teacher . They are all equally nuts and amazing . and then I have the overly happy conservative teachers = Willmore Smith and Putnam . So 3 potentially sucky and 3 amazing . I think my luck was ok this time 
DOCTOR WHOOOOO YAYYYYY !!!!!!! <3 <3 <3 
Wondering if it'd be a smart idea to try and graduate at 16 ... I could do it It IS possible . I think I want to do it .. But I'd have to take summer courses , and I'd have to take online classes with my Highschool classes ... I seriously am thinking about this . Graduating early , but not not not going to college immediatly . I wanted a year any ways before college ... hmmm ... Only thing is , gotta see what parents and others think .

Runningtostandstill . No one really wants the truth in life . We are fed lies and we believe them , but to uncover the truth ? God help us if someone does that , because then we have options , then we aren't blind to what goes on around us . Then we may make descisions that can no longer be controlled . Runningtostandstill . 
Just finished watching Loose Change , everything makes sense now ..... <3 it
