At the < PROPMALE > in Maui , 4 hours earlier than salt lake time . Much tired from the time change .... 
Got to wear a 90,000 $ watch ... 
Got my 2 wisdom teeth out ! 
Remember , for God's sake , Count The Shadows ... 
Nothing makes a day more relaxing than playing some MW2 . :) 
So what if it hurts me ? \ 
So what if I break down ? \ 
So what if this world just throws me off the edge\ 
My feet run out of ground\ 
I gotta find my place\ 
I wanna hear myself\ 
Don’t care about all the pain in front of me\ 
Cause I’m just trying to be happy 
Aw man .... I just read a manga but now I'm paranoid ... Doubt it's called ... Really good just not this late at night ( watches bedroom door ) >.> <.< 
I lost 
As i sink one more drink i am running out of ink\ 
\ 
Feeling void paranoid about every little thing\ 
And i wonder if i try to get up and say goodbye\ 
if i'll have the strength to leave\ 
Cuz i don't have much time anymore 
Close your eyes and roll a dice\ 
Under the board there's a compromise\ 
If after all we only lived twice\ 
Which lies the run road to paradise

I don't want to care\ 
And I don't want to hate\ 
And I don't want to see you fall too far away\ 
All because of fear'\ 
Cause when you're afraid\ 
you lash out and blame\ 
When you say all the things that you never meant to sa\ 
yAnd try to break me 
Fer sure maybe\ 
Fer sure not\ 
Fer sure eh\ 
Fer sure bomb 
Do you know what it's all about ? \ 
Are you brave enough to figure out ? \ 
Know that you could set your world on fire , \ 
If you're strong enough to leave your doubts . \ 
Feel it , breathe it , believe it and\ 
You'll be walking on air . \ 
Go try , go fly so high and\ 
You feel this , unless you kill it -\ 
Go on and you're forgiven . \ 
I knew , that I could feel that -\ 
I feel like I'm walking on air . 
Wonders why people are so critical of others . People , each , in their own way are unique in their own way , in their emotions , and how they live their life . 
This is why I always whisper , I'm a river with a spell\ 
I like to hear but not to listen , I like to say but not to tell\ 
This is why I always wonder , there's nothing new under the sun\ 
I won't go anywhere so give my love to everyone

Every shadow no matter how deep is threatened by morning light . 
Headlight , black demons\ 
Peering in my hollow core\ 
Grudges they're strangling\ 
and splinters and dry skin\ 
Streetlights they see me\ 
The whole world will reach for me\ 
All I got , all I got\ 
Is my scars 
All of the boys and the girls here in < PROPFIRST > \ 
Sing to the night without sight but with madness\ 
I can't keep up , I'm a wreck but I want it\ 
Tell me the truth , is it love or just < PROPFIRST > ? 
No one can say nothing , \ 
Which I guess means they'll say something , \ 
But I won't be around .... 
ou're a cast on , looking on\ 
You're an actor out of work\ 
I think I love you , I think I'm madYou're a boxer in the ring\ 
With brass knuckles underneath\ 
I think I love you , I think I'm mad 
If you , if you could return\ 
Don’t let it burn , don’t let it fade\ 
I’m sure I’m not being rude\ 
But it’s just your attitude\ 
It’s tearing me apart\ 
It’s ruining everything 
306 comments- within 2 something hours with 3 people .... We are that amazing 
Is there anybody out there walking alone ? \ 
Is there anybody out there , out in the cold ? \ 
One heartbeat lost in the crowd\

Is there anybody drowning pulled down by their fear ? \ 
I feel you , don't look away

Ok .... well .... I LOST XD 
I scraped my knees when I was praying\ 
And found a demon in my safest haven , seems like\ 
It's getting harder to believe in anything\ 
Than just to get lost in all my selfish thoughts\ 
I wanna know what it'd be like\ 
To find perfection in my pride\ 
To see nothing in the light\ 
Or turn it off in all my spite\ 
In all my spite i'll turn it off 
What if I wanted to breakL\ 
augh it all off in your face\ 
What would you do ? \ 
What if I fell to the floor\ 
Couldn't take all this anymore\ 
Come break me down\ 
Bury me , bury me\ 
I am finished with you 
It scares the hell out of me\ 
and the end is all I can see 
YAY ! It's storming :) 
Agree or disagree with Communism- WHY ? 
Heading out .... Be back on Sunday :3 
LOVE'S ESCAPE THE FATE'S NEW ALBUM 
Between the sadness and the smile\ 
Lies the flicker of the fire\ 
You always said this never hurt you\ 
I always said you were a liar\ 
With the all the towers and the wires\ 
There still lies a little silence\ 
Two hearts and one connection\ 
One voice lacks emotion now

Feels like I should be doing something important ..... Oh well i will remember later :P 
The booze turns a tall , gentle boy to a terrible totem\ 
And the kids gather round trying to see what's inside\ 
I think when he's drinking he's drowning some riot\ 
What is my friend trying to hide ?
