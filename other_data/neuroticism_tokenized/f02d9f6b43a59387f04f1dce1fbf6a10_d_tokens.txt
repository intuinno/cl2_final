So many roads and so little time to discover them all . Ever wish you could change the past ? Look at now like you might from the future , and change the today that will become tomorrow , with a future lacking only one thing : regrets . 
Next time I see a missing link evolution picture I'm gonna yell , \I know that guy ! \ " Cuz my guy friends are better apes than monkeys themselves sometimes . lol " 
We're so ninja . They never even suspected he spent the night . xD 
Isn't chaos the happening of what you never expected would ? Did a story ever emerge CHAOS . then the end ; period . Let's scramble the brains , though there's no peace of mind in crazy . 
Never watch another's step , for losing sight of where your own feet tread . In other words , judge someone else mutha fucka . 
Some driver flashed me 10 ! Oh my giggles , I feel so loved now . xD 
I'm going hunting and camping . .. woot .. :) 
Innerlight feat Ariga Yada- Fade Away .. That song makes me feel like a happy go lucky little kid every time . lol

I'm not dead ! :D 
Okay , a cowboy hat & boots with my silk bathrobe for a costume .. Or just a bathrobe and slippers ? Your vote matters . lol Don't vote and you kill a kitten . jk

Turns out everyone else in the theater was crackin too , so it was a blasty blast . 
\I use big words because ... I like to watch your eye twitch . \ " :D " 
Really ? You had to go and be a douche bag on a buddypoke app ? Airman , you're such a little girl . I really hope life helps you grow some balls . Or a spine . Either one would be a HUGE improvement for you .

A continent and ocean aren't too far to cross ... are they ? That's not tooooo much of a gap for a relationship ... o_O 
Ah , so many good laughs and good times . <3 
It's such a bitterness I can't describe . Another enemy has been revealed to me . How come I wasn't able to see , another vampire sucking out my life .. Just wait , wait for the smile I'll have when I pick the world up and drop it on your fucking heads .

Love me , ámharach grá . Cuz the < PROPFEMALE > die hard . ;) 
Have I found an intellectual conversation ?? No way ... I thought those < PROPMALE > old things were dead and gone . o_O 
Damn it all 
Last day at my work made me so sad . =( 
Some may die , others be born . And here we find ourselves looking for the difference between actually living life and merely being alive . 
Took a shower with my baby bird and it was so cute !! 
I need to find a crazy party for tomorrow . If anybody knows anything , hit me up . <3 
I'd prefer no questions , condolences , or remorseful words posted/commented . Just good things . Thank you . 
saol , sult , searc <3 
So Friday night I learned that I have three amazing friends who will quite literally hold my hair back when I'm smashed aka human volcano and < PROPFEMALE > me to a couch at 3am . FilPiggy , McConnernonner , and Momo , I gave you guys ridiculous nicknames and you still love me . You're the best ! <3 <3 
Went to the duck pond . Good idea . Accidentally dropped phone in . Bad idea . Uhhh it's somewhere in the pond now . x_x Sooo hopefully I can get a new one tomorrow . </3 
I hope every single person on my friends list has an absolutely fantastic day , no matter where you are , how well I know you , or what you are doing . We only get to live this day once . <3 
Did I really just hide from the delivery man ? Yes ... yes I did . lol
