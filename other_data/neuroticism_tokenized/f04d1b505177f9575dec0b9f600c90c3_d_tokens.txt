Dear Government , if you feel the need to stop paying our military personnel , then I think you should feel the need to stop paying yourselves . I'd like to see you support your family without a pay check ! By the way , maybe if you take your pay check down to less than $100K it would help some of the budget issues in < PROPFEMALE > . I'd like to see you survive on enlisted military personnel pay ! Repost if you agree !

Dear Congress , Last year I mismanaged my funds and this year I cannot decide on a budget .

Thank you very much for setting an example we can all f ...... ollow . \ 
Repost if you agree\
