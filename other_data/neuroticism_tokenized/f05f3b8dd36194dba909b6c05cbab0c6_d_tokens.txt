The more time you spend watching TV , the greater your risk of dying at an earlier age -- especially of heart disease . Compared to those that watch 2hrs a day , people who watched 4hrs or more were 80% more likely to die from heart diseas and 46% more likely to die from any cause ....!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
I want you to know , With everything I won't let this go , these words are my heart and soul , I'll hold on to this moment you know , ' cause I'll bleed my heart out to show , That I won't let go ,

today was one of those days you wish never happened ...... ok so i got the house back up to barely liveable standards instead of hazard zone .... and I got to see my boyfriend .... but ..... everything that happened today ..... regardless of the outcome .... was so stressful I can't even think straight ........ I wish I could go to sleep and wake up somewhere nice 
ok so when i thought it through .... actually all i needed to do was look at a picture of one of my friends ( my personal inspiration . ) I know how weird that sounds .... but it's more like he's a REAL inspiration . You'd have to hear him speak . Soooo ... now i'm ok . All I needed was to remember .... peace is attained through love and love through peace . Amazing what a picture can do . :) 
what to do what to do ......... ok .... Oregon is a def . possibility .... i guess it's my choice if i want it to be permanent .... < PROPFIRST > ? Oregon ? I don't think I can have both ..... why does it always come back to this

DID I CALL IT OR WHAT ?!?! he bailed again ..... work ..... tired 
that lump in throat won't go away , i run out of things to say , one day you'll stop running , from the past and the future , but too late I won't be there , now try again , let's talk this through , you say communication is important , but why won't you speak , not even for me . I followed you blind , now I have to find , my own life . 
so guess what .... last minute ... after a crazy depressing conversation .... he'll pick me up ... any time from a half hour from now ... to 2:00 in the morning ..... gonna go get ready i guess ... goodnight .... 
OK !!! so ... me & < PROPFIRST > are gonna stay together ... I've decided my family is crazy , they make me crazy , and I'll only know if it's < PROPFIRST > if I'm out and with him .... risky ? yes .... but why the hell not ! sometimes , it's just worth the risk ... and this would definitely be one of those times ... I guess it's not so much \where is my life headed\ " and more \ " my life is headed somewhere \"" 
? question < PROPFIRST > ?

Depression\ 
is not a sign of weakness , it is a sign that you have been trying to be\ 
strong for too long . Put this as your status if you know someone who \ 
has or has had depression . Will you do it , and leave it on your status \ 
for at least an hour ? Most people won't , but it's mental health week \ 
... and . 1 in 3 of us will suffer at some point in our lives . Show \ 
your support . 
sleep is good ... sleep is great .... now i'm gonna appreciate :P

I mean , he probably won't check his messages until late ... obsessed anyone ? seriously i need to get out of my house and just check it at the end of the day . every time it says \u got mail\ " I get all excited ... and then it's spam ... a lot like the phone ... when it rings I jump up and run and then it's for someone else . O.o "

I llllllooooovvvvveeeeee < PROPFEMALE > !!!!! She rocks my socks off , across the room and then they do a lil jig . It's quite amusing watching my socks dancing but then Danaan walks in and I have to explain why my socks are not only off but starting to tango with eachother ... Lol I'm not quite sure what he rocks off but I'm sure whatever it is it joins in the jamboree . 
On the road 
Omg so I woke up Rrrreallly early ... And got to sleep Rrrreeeeeaaallllly late . Fml ...... Now I'm on a two day trip on the road .... Rawr 
My family is collecting < PROPFEMALE > and butterfly corpses and they are next to me .... Creeeeeeeppy ... 
Still on the road ! The car broke down and then its lights died and then we got a flat tire this morning .... Silly life , road trips are for other people . :p 
Fuck ! \ 
In the middle of nowhere and the bank decided to rape our money in the face . We're gonna need to pray or something cuz we are totally screwed sideways at this point . Some higher power REALLY doesn't want us to get to Colorado . Send out good thoughts for us < PROPFEMALE > ? 
The good news is we're not dead it's not too hot and the trailor didn't flip . The bad news ... A the axle on the tire broke and the tire went flying and we are now paying like $400 for a tow the rest of the way . Tired ... And I haven't showered in 3 days or gotten any sleep cuz we've been sleeping in the car . OMG . What a freaky couple days . 
I got home the day before yesterday , but I've been waaay to tired to get on here and post something . Peace and love to all d you guys who sent me good thougts . I made it Colorado in one piece ... Ok so I've got mosquito bites the size of an egg that look like 50 nipples on my legs ... But technically i'm still in one piece . :) 
Who knows how to tag certain people in their posts ? Heeelllp meeeeee !!!! Please ? :)
