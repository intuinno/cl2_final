It was 2010 for me before it was 2010 for you ! 

More laundry ! Damnit my wife needs to get here already . I didn't get married to do my own laundry . What the bloody hell ? 
My wife should fly in tonight . I can't wait to see my family .

I just want to thank the Bryndas for providing me with the opportunity to have a sausage fest here in the desert . Thank you for the Hickory Farms . You guys rock ! 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas from Doha , Qatar . 
I talked with Leiya yesterday and before I got off of the phone with her she said , \I want my daddy were home with me\ " . I really miss her . " 
I had a dream last night that I came home . My Grandpa was there and with an unforgettable , loving smile he told me he loved me and then died in my arms . He passed away several years ago while I was in SC , but this dream was amazing . 
Married 3 and 1/2 years , We've been together for 7 years . < PROPFIRST > , thank you for being my starter-wife . Just kidding . I love you long time .

New phrase for the masses . \ 
\ 
Getting gayed - The action of inadvertently witnessing a homosexual activity or something that could be construed as homosexual in nature . \ 
example :\ 
I just saw two dudes on a moped . Man , I just got gayed . \ 
P.S. - Witnessing two chicks doing something is not getting gayed , that's just awesome . 
Back in Germany . 
Istanbul was Constantinople\ 
Now it's Istanbul , not Constantinople\ 
Been a long time gone , Constantinople\ 
Now it's Turkish delight on a moonlit night\ 
I'm in Turkey ... This seemed appropriate . 
I made the < PROPFIRST>'s List 
I've been streaming music , TV shows , and movies through my PS3 for quite some time . I just figured out how to stream internet radio . WOOT ! 
Up the stairs . Down the stairs . Up . Down . Tired of this . 
Germany clothes dryers sound like airplanes . I think my house is about to lift off of the ground . 
Cup O'Noodles ... So bad they put it in a Styrofoam cup . 
\Like\ " my status and I'll tell you : \ 
I didn't buy < PROPFEMALE > for the Trick-or-Treaters , who , interestingly enough , were all < PROPMALE > . I didn't think I would have any to be honest . Needless to say , I am out of granola bars . I will definitely be buying groceries tomorrow . 
So the other night my wife calls and wakes me up . When I answered the phone I told her , \Java allows it . \ " I think this programming class is getting to me . " 
I was supposed to meet some friends for dinner and I fell asleep . Sorry guys . 
Grey Goose Vodka Martini . Delicious ! 
A veteran is someone , who at one point in their life , wrote a blank check payable to the United States of < PROPFEMALE > for an amount up to , and including , their life . That is beyond honor , and there are way too many people in this country who no longer remember that fact . Copy and paste this as your status if you are a Veteran or thankful for your < PROPFEMALE > n Veterans and people in service . 
So I rocked out a 94% in my Intermediate Java programming class . I'm still waiting on the grade for my other class . If I get an A in that class I will be done with 80 credits of school work and still have a 4.0 GPA . Not too bad for a C average high school student . 
Got the A I was looking for 80 credits down 40 to go . Come on suma cum laude !! 
So I want to go see the Bears play when I am home during the holidays and ran across a scam artist . I have gleefully been stringing him along . Suggestions will be considered and applied if worthy . Here's what we have so far : 
I can't wait for the Bears-Vikes game ! I'll be there . Monday Night Football ! Go Bears !!! 
I want to put water in a fancy jar and sell it as cologne/perfume . I will call it scentsless ! 
The game was too close but a wins a win . Go Bears !!! 
Rocked out an 86.7 on the PT test . 
A normal person has 1,000 wishes . A Soldier only has one , to come home safe . I know 97% of you won't post this as your status , but the 3% that do are my friends . In honor of someone that died , a wounded warrior , or who is fighting for your freedom , please repost in their honor 
Sunday I leave Germany for a little holiday vacation . Monday I will be in Minneapolis for an outside Monday Night Football Game . Wednesday , will be Chicago museum day . Portland on the 28th , Jacksonville on the 29th , and Miami for New Year's < PROPFEMALE > . I'm starting to feel like < PROPMALE > Griswold

Flight slipped 24 hours . Still in Space A hell . Also , I'm like number 130ish on the priority list . FML !!! Maybe I'll get there by Christmas :(
