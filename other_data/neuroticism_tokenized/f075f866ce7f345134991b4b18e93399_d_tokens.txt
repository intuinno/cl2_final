I just don't know what to do with myself ...

thinks it's ridiculous that it costs $15 to get into the Brooklyn Botanic Gardens for the < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Festival . I can't afford it and I'm disappointed that I can't go . 
should not watch food network anymore . 
Is doing the karaoke thing tonight . Yup 
loves green beans 
\The naming of cats is a difficult matter\ 
Is home making hats and not going to karaoke . I hate being broke ... 
While you SCREAM at your woman , there's a \ 
manwishing he could talk softly to her ear ... While you HUMILIATE , \ 
OFFENDand INSULT her , there's a man flirting with her and reminding \ 
her how wonderful she is . While you HURT your woman , there's a man \ 
wishing hecould make love to her . While you make your women CRY \ 
there's a man stealingsmiles from her ... Post this on your wall if \ 
you're against DomesticViolence 
tonight is dedicated to those whose lives read like song titles or lyrics . Whether it all seems to be a bit of history repeating or that you don't know what you've got ' till it's gone or maybe you're falling in love all over again . Salud . 
Tuesday night again and I'm not at Karaoke ... This brokeness is getting very old .

question to all my friends in relationships : What percent of time , when both you and your significant other do not have other obligations ( School , work , non-social activities ) spend apart ? 
was up until 4 and woke up at 7 . 
Is wondering where the people are ... 
to all the Dads and Dad-to bes : Happy Father's day ! 
Black out on my block ... Power lines on fire . 
is awake writing a paper due in 2 and a half hours . College again . Yay . 
finished my final paper with time to spare ... 
So desperately I sing to thee of love , sure but also rage and hate and pain and fear of self and I can't keep these feelings on the shelf I've tried . 
today : last day of summer session 1 , tomorrow-Monday : 4 day break , Tuesday : begining of summer session 2 ... fun 
thinks deep fried pickles sounds like a great idea . 
Is at home bored with nothing better to do than comment your stuff ! Somebody save me ... 
Got to class at 8am for a class that doesn't start until 8:30 am :-\\ 
\Curl like smoke and breath again\ 
Can't figure out who is worse the scattered marketing professor or the militant business law professor ... 
How could it be that I was born without a clue to < PROPFEMALE > on , and still it is the same now I am older . Armed with just a will and then this love for singing songs , and minding less and less if I get colder . But I have this funny ache and it's burning in my chest and it spreads just like a fire inside my body . Is it something god left out in my spirit or my flesh would I be saved if I were brave ... 
is so very disappointed . 
\The price of getting what you want 
\Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel\ 
Can we go back to 1999 ? there are some things I'd like to do differently ... 
Just got the results from the city test I took a while back ... 100% ... Rank #77 ... wait a minute what ? 77th on the list of people who can get Clerical jobs in NYC ? That's Ca-Ray-ZEE ! 
Last day of class for the summer session ! Finals on Thursday . 12 credits in 12 weeks <3 then a little bit of time off before fall semester starts ... 
and now finals ... 
is glad to be done with school for a couple weeks but has no clue what to do with herself now . 
I have of late , but wherefore I know not , lost all my mirth ... this goodly frame the earth seems to me a sterile promontory ... why , it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapors ... 
Autumn's sweet we call it fall , I'll make it to the < PROPFEMALE > if I have to crawl ... 
I'm a loner , I'm a loser , I'm a winner in my mind . I'm a bad one , I'm a good one , I'm a sick one with a smile . 
\I remember when we were driving driving in your car . \ 
\These chicks don't even know the name of my band ... \"" 
Out and About ! 
has come to realize what have is not a lack of ambition , rather it's a lack of the kind of support and confidence I need to get myself going . 
Saw a cool show and now has new bands to follow <3 
\Love belongs to < PROPFEMALE > 
hates not understanding , not knowing and not having a plan . 
I have no cell phone for now and have no idea when or if I'll be getting a replacement 
is going to make last minute preparations for the first day of class tomorrow . Gotta at least buy a notebook ... 
here again , here again , bored bored bored . 
Just found out who my professors are and I'm not exactly pleased . 
Sleep , my little babby-oh ; Sleep until you waken ; When you wake you'll see the world ; If I'm not mistaken ... Kiss a lover ; Dance a measure ; Find your name ; And buried treasure ... Face your life ; Its pain , its pleasures ; Leave no path untaken . 
Preparing for the first long day ... Class10a- 11:40 a , 1p- 2:40 p , 6p- 7:15 p , 7:20 p- 8:35 p ... 
first class of the morning over ... going to try to deal with the workstudy stuff before my second class ... after I get some breakfast . 
Workstudy office fail ... yes , give me 20 pages of forms to fill out then say you can't help when I have questions about them . Obviously these tax related forms make perfect sense to me who has never filed taxes :-\\ where's that sledgehammer ? 
First two classes went well I actually like one of the professors I was worried about 3 hour break now so I'm going over to Starbucks Dumbo to chill out for a bit the school is a madhouse . 
Oh boy that last professor was ... wow ... one more class then gonna < PROPFEMALE > around lower manhattan for a while . 
All said and done the first day of class was oddly satisfying . 
\had noticed that events were \ 
I realize now how much I need school . I cannot learn from books and reading but give me an educated voice to listen to and I learn effortlessly . I'm going to know everything I ever thought I couldn't learn about banking , loans and interest if today is any indication ! FNB 100 FTW ! But now break until 6 . 
One more class then who knows ? I'm still deciding I've got until 8:35 to decide though so it's all good . 
is going to enjoy the night with a little walk across the bridge <3 
I've got an itch that I just can't scratch . 
I heard yesterday that there are bed bugs at my school ... EW . 
going to be out most of the day randomly hanging out in random places with < PROPFIRST > Crespo I'll try to check facebook when I can if anyone is looking for me . 
walked all over downtown Manhattan and went to about 8 different < PROPMALE>'s looking for sticky Bindi Jewels all for Khalila < PROPFIRST > ! I'm glad I went though it kept me from sitting home thinking myself into a depression . 
is getting ready to cook for my siblings . I <3 entertaining . 
got some rather annoying news today ... Some things never change . 
commercial+snuggie+tune from macarena = O_o +WTF+Epic fail 
what is it about me that makes people think when I say something I'm being mean , negative or aggressive ? :-\\ 
Checking out the school's club fair then off to Starbucks Dumbo . 
fall is here ... I've got allergies . 
is watching channel 7's cancer research telethon . 
Hard cider between classes ... Yep . It's like that .

my sweet little chirping , spoon chasing , silly , gray baby is gone ... 
Bleh 
\I'm a new day rising . I’m a brand new sky to < PROPFEMALE > your stars upon tonight . I'm a little divided : Do I stay or run away and leave it all behind ? It’s times like these you learn to live again . It’s times like these you give and give again . It’s times like these you learn to love again . It’s times like these time and time again .. \"" 
\I want to love you and treat you right . I want to love you every day and every night . We'll share the same room with a roof right over our heads . We'll share the shelter of my single bed . Is this love ? Is this love ? Is this love ? Is this love that I'm feeling ? \"" 
\Forgot all about yesterday ; Remembering I'm pretending to be where I'm not anymore . \ 
loves that no school Monday means a week off of school for me .

\Shapes of every size move behind my eyes . Doors inside my head bolted from within . Every drop of flame lights a candle in memory of the one who lived inside my skin ... \ " Shadow on the Sun ~ Audioslave " 
is thinking about ordering a case of mead . 
the pieces of my heart that I have given away tether me to those I love . If I've ever told you I love you rest assured I still do regardless of time and distance . 
so many errands so much laziness ... 
should really be doing homework but isn't ...

just watched 6 straight hours of \Boys Over Flowers\ " plan is now to sleep then watch more . Best hurricane ever . " 
I had the best experience in a hair salon ever at Arrojo cosmetology school . I'll never get my hair done in the hood again . 
Apparently some moron with a gun decided to use my yard as a getaway path . The place is now thankfully crawling with cops . 
< PROPFIRST > Glover I'd like to thank you I went on Netflix for the first time in months and I had to watch \Darmok\ " <3 It's all your fault . "
