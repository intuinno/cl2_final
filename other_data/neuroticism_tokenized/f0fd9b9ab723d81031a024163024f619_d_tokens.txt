is childless this week . Idle hands .. . . 

Families celebrate Independence Day by purchasing and igniting hundreds of dollars of explosives and incendiary devices . Bizarre . Sacrifice your fingers in the name of patriotism !! 
All of our sisters are in town ; we are in Sisters out of town . 
Trip to the mountains : we followed a cattle truck which was blowing back liquid cow < PROPFEMALE > and urine onto our car -- we had to keep the wipers going just to see , no passing < PROPFIRST > for < PROPMALE > . Fear of e-coli kept us in the car till we found an automatic car was 
Finally . A job interview ! 
My oldest child is in Norway , eating WHALE meat . Greenpeace , save him ! 
31 quarts of pickles , and nearly ALL of them sealed . Damn , I'm good ! 
Let me know if you want an Entertainment Book -- Brian is selling them to benefit his high school marching band . 
Love is a crisp apple from the Farmer's Market . 
Swine flu is going around < PROPFIRST>'s school . He was vaccinated with live weakened virus Wednesday , and now he's sick . Is this a case of too little too late , or one of the cure being worse than the malady ? 
October is the cruelest month , breeding property taxes out of the dead land . . . .

\Spring forward\ " sucks . " 
The musical is over , Driver's < PROPMALE > is over , spring break is here . Breathe ! 
I have sanded , washed with TSP , rinsed , spackled , taped and painted the walls this week . Should I be surprised that my carpal tunnel is back ? 
Wallpaper disaster . It looked great on the bolt -- gray-green vines with burgundy berries and gold accents . Installed , it looks like Christmas vomited on my walls . 
Lady K , Philma , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , Michelle -- great weekend !!! My stomach hurts from laughing , or is that too many bourbon slushes ? 
I love the symphony ! 
Well , sponge painting the walls didn't work . Paint too thin , too green -- looked like snot running down the walls . 
Congratulations to < PROPFIRST > , who just passed level nine of OMTA's Piano Syllabus ! 
Gotta brag ! < PROPMALE > just won Oberlin's < PROPMALE > Prize for a paper he wrote ! 
< PROPFIRST > is so much like me -- in the most twisted and disturbing ways . What other two people in the entire world would enter a room , take one look at each other , and begin barking like seals ? 
More brag : < PROPFIRST > has been promoted by < PROPMALE > Caribbean to be the Assistant Musical Director on his ship -- 
< PROPFIRST > and I have been married twenty six years today . 
I have purchased tickets for the Oregon Country Fair--Eugene's original , wild , organic , unwashed , long-haired , hippie-loving , counter-culture , groovy celebration of wholistic living and love-fest with the Earth . Gosh , wonder if I can scare up a tie-dye shirt ? 
Thank you for the birthday wishes ! I spent the morning marching in the < PROPFEMALE > Parade because my loving husband volunteered us as marching band chaperones . That entitles me to gin and tonics for the rest of the day ! 
I sure like my pressure washer . A few well-aimed blasts and the deck is clean as a whistle . Wish they made one for laundry , dishes , the bathroom , pets , kids . . . . 
I went to the Oregon Country Fair yesterday . No , I did not go topless , nor barefoot , nor paint my face , nor smoke marijuana , nor belly dance to sitar music , nor dress in costume , nor juggle , nor purchase tie-dye , nor get a massage , nor sing and dance in a parade , nor sell condoms packaged like roses . . . but the people watching was fabulous ! 
< PROPFIRST > is off to camp with his friend < PROPFIRST > ; what kind of trouble shall I get into this week ? 
Ah , a new hedge clipper . Brings out my destructive impulses . 
< PROPMALE>'s home ! 
< PROPMALE > has left . He may be gone for two years . :-( 
< PROPMALE > and his friend < PROPFEMALE > made it back to Ohio after a cross-country road trip in a < PROPFEMALE > packed to the gills with luggage , < PROPMALE>'s entire drum < PROPFEMALE > , and a live cat wandering loose in the car . 
< PROPFIRST>'s home ! 
Reading recommendation : Good Book , by < PROPFIRST > Plotz . A hilarious interpretation of the Old Testament , thoroughly enjoyable ! 
Gotta love the DMV . Two hours of people watching . Saw < PROPMALE > twice . 
Just came from the beauty salon . Some days I'm sure the only difference between chimpanzees and human beings is a good haircut . 
< PROPFIRST > turned 16 on Monday and got his license the same day . Just now I handed him the keys and watched him drive off to band practice . Weird . . . suddenly my middle name is no longer \transportation . \"" 
< PROPFIRST > is on his way to < PROPFEMALE > , Italy ! :-) We won't see him again for six to eight months . :-( 
I am home from the hospital after being hysterectomized , and now I am officially an invalid for the next month ! Woo Hoo ! I will do anything -- A-N-Y-T-H-I-N-G -- to avoid hosting Thanksgiving at my house . 
My friend < PROPFEMALE > just got her book published ! Find it online at Amazon and at Barnes and Noble : Hope and a Future , by < PROPFEMALE > Arrigotti .

One of those days . Car dead in the garage , waited for AAA , trip to the dealership service dept ., missed my hair appoinment , found myself at grocery store without list or bags . So confused . Must be Monday . 
Would anyone like to have two tickets for FREE bowling at Sunset Lanes , December 18 , from 11:30 - 1:30 , shoe rental included ? I bought the tickets as part of a band fundraiser , but now I have a conflict . First come , first serve ! 
This Christmas my two older sons will be as far away as geographically possible : < PROPFIRST > in Brazil , and < PROPMALE > in < PROPFEMALE > . Hmm . Should I be taking this personally ?

Liking American Idol this season . Love the new judges--don't miss < PROPMALE > at all -- and the level of talent among the contestants is UNBELIEVABLE . 
It takes so little to make my day . Internet Explorer kept crashing on my computer . . . and I figured out how to fix it ! I feel like a genius ! 
If your children have accused you of being too demanding , too insensitive , too unreasonable , and too controlling , you need to read \Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother\ " by < PROPFEMALE > Chua . You'll be reassured . " 
There is no feeling in the world like the one you get when you spend your entire tax refund on plumbing . 
Home from Ohio . It was great to see my boy .
