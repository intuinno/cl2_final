Old face in different places . \

And 21:00 on my 5k . Not too bad . 

* cackles maniacally * 
Last full day .... and I spend it taking apart Christmas decorations . \ 
FFFFUUUU- 
I just deleted something and I don't know what it does ... dammit . 
When you're living with your parents , why is it called \still living at home\ " ? Isn't your home wherever you live ? " 
Blizzards are quite delicious ... well , until you work at a DQ . Then they're sorta \meh \"" 
Noo ! The mosquitos have found their way into the house !! Dear God , they're everywhere ! 
Lawnmower + Stray barbed wire = Me underneath the lawnmower with a cutter trying to remove the barbed wire from the blades . I hate math ... 
My God ... Why is Supertramp's Logical Song so amazing ? 
One hundred and sixty-six mosquito bites . One hundred and sixty-six . I was bored enough to count ' em . 
Why pay a dollar less for something that will last half as long ? 
Yo dawg , i herd you and yo dog likes yo-yos , so I put yo dawg on yo yo-yo so you can yo-yo yo dawg while you yo-yo , dawg . 
I do like the pessimists ' point of view . It makes life that much more fun . 
So ... I just discovered that scientists recently concluded that the Triceratops never actually existed . The fossils and skeletons they observed were actually juvenile forms of the Torosaurus . My mind has been blown ... 
does not appreciate 93 degrees . I hate hot weather and Wisconsin is full of it . 
Some days , sitting back and just relaxing is the best way to enjoy life . Other days , it's not . I'm so bored >.> 
Man , I wish they had a Little Caesar's up in Chilton = C 
It's 11:00 at night , and I really , really want to go for a run . 
Cousin came back from Australia . I have a boomerang =) Now I can finally fight the squirrel horde in the backyard . 
Work today . Hmm ... 
There are certain stereotypes to go with gender , race , and age when ordering food at a fast-food restaurant . I find it hilarious . 
Up and down\ 
and in the end\ 
it's only round and round 
PT in Oshkosh for Navy . Time to see how out of shape I am . 
This is the first time I've ever realized summer is almost over and not been immediately depressed . * relaxes * 
I'm glad I don't have 300 dollars , because if I did , I'd waste it on a new Xbox . >.> 250 gigs , man . TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY GIGS ! 
I think ... I'm going have a snack . 
Ribs ? Oh hot damn ! 
Just watched Shutter Island . What an incredible movie . Twist through me off completely . 
So I can't do a backflip off a swing into a pond . What of it ? 
So I work today . I'd much rather go swimming . 
So much to do and so little time to do it ... and yet I'm here on Facebook =/ 
is singing the lyrics to an instrumental . 
Birthdays on the 19th , 20th , 21st , and 23rd of this August . \ 
That's a lot of presents on one paycheck ... 
They say there's a heaven for those who will wait\ 
Some say it's better but I say it ain't\ 
I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints\ 
the sinners are much more fun ... 
B-B-B-Blue Man Group tomorrow in Chicago ! Yeah ! 
Blue Man Group tomorrow !! 1 ! Whoo ! \ 
Although , I gotta get up at like 5 tomorrow morning =( 
Chicago and Blue Man group ? Fun . Walking around for hours and getting back home around 1 am ? Not Fun . Going to work the next day and standing the entire time ? = C 
Mowing the lawn . X ( 
I'm bored . How bout the rest of you ? 
Hot damn , I'm still tired from Chicago trip . I'm getting old ... 
I'm so very much tempted to go to the fdl water park one last time . 
Whoo ! Internet isn't sucking at the mome-*disconnects *

Birthday week fast approaches and I've yet to finalize the buying of the gifts . 
Half an hour left < PROPFEMALE > . Enjoy it while you can . 
If cryogenics were all free , we could all live like Walt Disney and live for all eternity inside a block of ice ... 
So I just found out I got a 4 on the AP Psych test . I am pleased . 
I feel like writing , but don't know what to write . First five people to give me any topic will recieve a poem and/or a short story depicting their topic . 
I am a sore loser through and through ... 
To feed teh horses before work or not to feed teh horse before work ? Probably feed . Wish I could feed the horses and somehow not the goats . 
I have a song stuck in my head , but I know none of the lyrics , the artist , or even the name of the song . It's just the same guitar riff over and over again . Gragh ! 
Well Facebook , since you're so < PROPMALE > to find out what's on my mind , I'll tell you . Sleep . Anti-climactic , wasn't it ? * passes out * 
I really want to ride my bike all the way to FDL just for kicks . But riding back is gonna suck . And I'd get bored halfway through . Anyone feel like going for a bike ride ? 
Why are mosquitos such an integral part of the ecosystem ? Why can't we purge this blood-sucking evil from this earth without causing an unstable and chaotic imbalance in the food web ? Why God why ??? * itches bite on knuckle * 
: headdesk : Grah ! Why can't we genetically modify mosquitos so they don't have to suck blood in order to feed their offspring ? 
DEP Meeting today . Gotta drive to Oshkosh . They fix 41 yet ? 
What day is it ? I don't even know anymore . 
Bwahaha ! 
11 hour workday . I'm fairly awake yet too . 
Fuck it . I can't take it anymore . Going for a run after work tomorrow before I explode . 
Running would have worked today , except I was at DQ until 7 instead of 5 . And my knee is acting up . Damn it , this isn't supposed to happen until I'm 40 . 
Today would be the perfect day for DQ ice cream ... if I didn't work there >.> Blugh 
: Biking to work whenever possible . 
is not happy about the Xbox Live price increase , despite not having an Xbox . 
Don't drink the Kool-Aid ! 
Blueberry pancakes . Yesssssssssssss 
What the hell's the point of being able to upload a . gif if it doesn't move anyways ? 
It was only fantasy . \ 
The wall was too high , as you can see . \ 
No matter how he tried , he could not break free . \ 
And the worms ate into his brain . 
Saw a bunch of kids playin ' good ol ' fashioned kickball today . I miss kickball . I was able to identify the pitcher that always tossed bouncy , the one kid that demolished the ball everytime , the one outfielder that snags every catch , and the girl that's better than most of the guys . Remember those guys from your childhood ? \ 
I was the kid that always drove a wormburner straight back to the pitcher . 
I'm starting to figure out the organizing options on the FB photo uploader . They couldn't possibly make this anymore difficult than it needed to be , unless they integrated time travel . 
Trance techno . Best or best ever ? 
I think I'll write me up one o ' them there fancylike workout schedules . 
The amount of boredom coursing through my veins is unparalleled . Someone , for the love of god , save me . 
Ok , folks . After a very heated discussion/debate/shouting match about the definition of \suck\ " 
So is there a weed eater out there that * doesn't * fling sharp and pointy objects ( pieces of nettle , woodchips , the occasional rock , etc . ) at my face at faster than the speed of Jesus ? 
\Nothing is as it seems . \ 
Inception might quite possibly be one of the greatest movies I have ever watched . Ever . 
Going for a run . Back in thirty . 
So an expected thirty minute run turned into a twenty minute run , because I ended up running the intended route a third faster than expected . 
There's no such thing as winning and losing in debates . Only which side looked more like an ass . You can spam me as many links as you want . Doesn't necessarily make your rant coherent . 
Every time I hit the backspace button and it takes me to the last < PROPFEMALE > I visited , I die a little on the inside . 
Today's one of those days where the only thing that can make you feel better is punting babies across your yard . 
Bored and tomorrow doesn't seem to pick up much . =/ 
Cutting down trees , splitting wood , then work from 5-8 tomorrow . =( 
Awwww . No chainsaw today . It's raining . =( Guess I gotta split the wood now >:( 
Woooooorrrrkkkk tomorrow . 
Am I the only one with random urges to drop-kick people ? 
I don't know what person discovered this , but I rediscovered it . If you spill your glass of beverage , it immediately pools up under the closest paper related object . Book/homework/legally binding contract . Wtf ?? 
Shitty weather makes it harder to get motivated . Don't feel like running today , despite actually having time to . 
I amused by the fact that I'm sitting here , being amused at the fact that you're all in school and getting pummelled with homework while I'm sitting here being amused . =) 
My ankle hurts . =( 
So as I go in to change the sign at DQ , I notice all the trees and the tp flutterin ' in the breeze . I look around and realize \Man 
Fucking Facebook ... 
Anybody out there in Concert Band I ? I wanna know if Shipe stabbed or strangled anyone yet . 
\Internet Explorer cannot load minecraft.net\"\ 
Minecraft . <3 
Minecraft . So simple on the outside , so complex on the ins-CREEPER ! NOOOOOO !! 
Stupid Family Day at DQ =( 
Damn you < PROPFIRST > ! \MARY HAD A LITTLE LAMB AND HER DAD WAS PISSED AS HELL \"" 
Boom chyick chyick Boom chyick chyick 
curb-stomping puppies since 1992 . 
So . Much . Shit to do =( 
Was waken up at 6 this morning and again at 7:30 , had molten sugar fall off my Pop-Tart and stick to my hand like napalm , woke up again at 8:45 , and then again at 10 to change the sign at DQ . \ 
I better win the damn lottery or my day officially sucks . 
I don't understand why no one understands . Someone's word should be held in the utmost regard . There should be no deception . There should be no lies or loopholes . Trust and loyalty are some of man's most important virtues and it's pretty damn embarrassing that we live in a world where both are tossed aside . If no one can believe your promises , then what good are you ? 
Breast Cancer Awareness Month kinda pisses me off . I seriously don't mean to offend anyone , but why is it any different than any other type of cancer ? It's lethal and can be stopped if caught early . It shouldn't be Breast Cancer Awareness . It should be Cancer Awareness . 
Oh my god , I have Hall and Oates stuck in my head ! XC 
I want to go to the FDL parade , but I work from 5-8 . Such a useless shift =( 
Smashed some fingers on my hand while splitting wood today . Missed three hours of work . Damn . Coulda used the hours . 
The temptation to buy a 70 dollar fish is high . But my will is strong and I shall resist ! 
Work work work work work work work work work work work work work 
Outclassed , outnumbered , outdated , and I'm out of < PROPFEMALE > . FML >.> 
Packers . Git < PROPFEMALE > shit together . 
Monday morning is usually met with groans and a rather loud \son of a bitch ! \ " \ 
Neenah has proved once again that they suck . Big time . =( \ 
Stupid volleyball team . 
Cynicism is the best form of flattery ... \ 
Not really . But I rather like being a cynic . 
I was so eager to gtfo of work and get home , but now that I'm here , I'm bored =/ 
My calves hurt XC . Digging up canna beds were a little more exhausting than anticipated . 
Canna totals for 2010 : 255 gallons of green and 45 gallons of red . \ 
Estimated totals for 2011 : Twice that amount . 
No , I don't want to create a god damned group ! Leave me alone , Facebook >:( 
: contributing to obesity ratings 1500 calories at a time =/ 
I bet that woodchuck would be chucking something else if it saw your face . >.> 
I used to care about my grades . When I was in middle school , it was all just for me . When I was Freshman , it was for my parents . When I was a Sophomore and < PROPMALE > , it was to make my teachers ' disapproving glares go away . When I was a Senior , I stopped caring . What's the point ? When I'm dead and gone , nobody is gonna say \that guy only received a C+ in Spanish IV\ " as they walk past my grave . " 
Why is all the good music old ? \ 
Ex : Miserlou . Seeing a 70 year old guy demolish a guitar with awesome playingness makes me wish I was there when it was popular . 
\You go 
Please allow me to introduce myself . I'm a man of wealth and taste . 
Ultra sad face does not even begin to describe my emotion right now = C 
Payday was two days ago and I'm already looking forward to the next one . 
< PROPMALE > Matthews . You are my hero . 
Entertain me . 
To hell with that one fly that keeps landing on you , no matter how many times you try to swat it away . 
Meh . Bored . =( 
So NaNoWriMo ... I hear you're back in town . That's cool . * silently panics * 
How do ads on Facebook work ? Do they use tracking cookies to determine where you've been spending your time or are they just generalized ads ? \ 
I just saw a private Minecraft server ad and I'm a bit curious . 
Gah ! I have La Rodana stuck in my head . That song was from sophomore year ! 
Work . Work . Work . Work . \ 
Yet I don't care . Must be the expected 80 hour paycheck next Friday . =) 
Yes ... I think Facebook adverts ARE stalking me . \ 
I'm now recieving ads about NaNoWriMo and Minecraft . Stupid cookies . 
It was early morning yesterday ... \ 
I was up before the < PROPFEMALE > . 
THE NETHER IS THE SCARIEST SHIT EVER . FUCK YOUR SILENT HILL ! 
Haaaaaang on Sloopy . Sloopy < PROPFEMALE > on . \ 
Please . Oh please oh please oh please get this song out of my head . 
Bluh . 2,000 words behind . I just * can't * get motivated today . 
Please put this on your status if you know someone ( or are related to someone ) who has been eaten by a dragon . My wish for 2010 is that people will understand that being eaten by dragons is not something to be ashamed of . Dragons are nearly unstoppable and are truly terrifying and when people go against them unprepared ...... there is almost no hope . 93% won't copy and paste this as they have been eaten by dragons . 
HOLY MOTHER OF GOD ! http://kotaku.com/5677841/you-wont-believe-who-is-killing-zombies-in-call-of-duty-black-ops 
After < PROPMALE > , I'm not surprised that Wisconsin went Republican . Eh . 
What's this about me moving a piano now ? 
Cold Stone Creamery . Why the FUCK has no one told me about this before ? 
Fuck this weather . It's driving me crazy . It's gonna pull me in and trick me into enjoying it and once I'm used to it and happy , BAM -30 degrees with wind chill and ice everywhere . 
I feel like ... meh . Nvm , it went away . 
It takes an entire hour of my time to check up on all my Internet stuffs every morning . 
I don't understand . The christmas lights went into storage all in working order and in tight little bundles . Ten months later , they come out of storage all fused together into a giant ball of death and knots and only half of them work . Did a fucking grenade go off some time in those ten months ? 
Fuck , ESPNU Campustown is almost exactly like Farmsville . And I'm hooked . =( 
I got a raw spot on the bottom of the inside of my mouth from a popcorn seed . =( It hurts . 
Went and saw Megamind with my cousin . It's a cute little movie . Animated is getting pretty realistic . 
Why isn't Wisconsin in the Top 10 affiliates for ESPNU CollegeTown ? \ 
Why is Arizona State THE top affiliate ? It's Arizona State >.> 
* wishes he had someone to run with * 
We will miss you , Petrenko . =( 
God dammit Redskins . Had you won , I would have won 25 bucks from my football pool . Sure , I put point(s ) on the Eagles , but that's irrelevant . 
Still pissed I can't figure out how to add fans on College Town . 
I'm such a fucking rebel . I mixed my colors with my whites in the laundry . \ 
Don't mess with this shit . 
If the customer is always right , what happens when they admit they are wrong ? 
OMG ! THEY NOW HAVE NERF BATTLE-AXES AND MACES ALONG WITH THE NERF SWORDS . 
Packers are deliciously destroying the Vikings . Savor teh flavor . 
Rhiiiaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaanoooooooon . Rhiiiaaaaaaaaaaanooooooon . 
I'm gettin ' friend requests and I don't even know who you are . WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE !? 
Sometimes I wanna copy someone's status , and then punch them in the face because they did the same thing to someone else , and it's not very creative . 
Turkey turkey turkey turkey turkey turkey turkey turkey turkey turkey turkey turkey turkey turkey turkey turkey turk-MMPH ! Blah ! WTF is this ? No , I don't want any walnut cranberry sauce ! Why is -- Oh god dammit , the juices seeped into my turkey ! 
Delicious , delicious day . 
Your religion is less fictional than all the others . Prove it . 
Is there a trail in this world with waterfalls and steep cliffs and towering trees and clear streams ? With the earthy smell of dirt and ferns rising from the ground and birds chirping and water rushing . A place where the sun shines brightly and when it rains , you don't give a damn . A miniature world with fresh air and tranquility . Somewhere where I can run for < PROPMALE > and never get bored . 
IF I STARE LONG ENOUGH , MY VISION TURNS TO BLACK ! \ 
Seriously , I should probably take my contacts out before something bad happens . 
FDL mall is boring . A&A is tasty , but I almost threw up the cheese stuffed mushroom . 
STOP BLAMING SUICIDE RATES , DEPRESSION , SHOOTING , GLOBAL WARMING , AND DESENSITIZING CHILDREN ON VIDEO GAMES , YOU POLITICAL FUCKTARDS ! \ 
I can guaren-fucking-tee that the generation bashing us was bashed in their youth by the generation abovt them . 
Oh < PROPFIRST > Assange , you rascal ! 
Oh the weather outside is frightful , but the fire inside's delightful . Since there's no place to go , STAY THE FUCK INSIDE . \ 
I don't mind the cold , but I'm not a fan of the snow this year . 
First one fifty one or you're wrong . 
Oh hey Facebook ! What's u-PAF ! \ 
Ow ! The angst has taken physical form ! 
Race tomorrow . It's gonna huuurrrrt . Hope to get under 13 minutes .

I like running in the snow =D 
typing something about my life on Facebook that's obscure and completely pointless to people who don't know what's going on already

Two snowplows crashed in the ditch in the same area on my road . I'm not going anywhere . \ 
Can't say the same for the Vikings lol

Oh my ! It appears that I personally have found myself to be located upon an aquatic vessel in which many < PROPFEMALE > activities can take place . 
I pee Amongst the Trees . 
So I'm starting to see authors purchasing advertising space on the television for their books . Talk about broadcasting to the wrong audience lol .

When will I learn that with great joy comes great sorrow ? Nothing will ever go as planned and there will always be the turd in your Cheerios . \ 
Apparently , every move I make is the wrong one . 
I will destroy whomever moved my retainer from my dresser to the floor next to the stairs . \ 
I can feel my teeth shifting . There goes several thousand dollars ' worth of dental work . : facepalm : 
See y'all in two months . 
It's 4 AM here at O'Hare Airport . I've been up since 1 AM and I'll be in Charleston in a few hours . \ 
P.S. Boot Camp sucks . Missed many of you . Didn't miss a whole lot more . 
I miss anything ? 
Ever have more than one song going through your head at the same time ? It's like firing Jello out of a cannon at 400 mph : not really achieving anything and a pain in the ass to clean up . 
< PROPFIRST > hungry . < PROPFIRST > smash . 
The biggest decision I've made so far today was whether I wanted Ramen or Oreos for lunch . \ 
I went with Subway .

To lose one you've known and admired and looked up to for your entire life is a very hard loss indeed . To be able to handle the effects of such a loss marks a remarkably strong person . I am not strong enough , but I know those in my family who are .
