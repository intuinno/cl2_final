\It was his calling and his curse \"" 

Just booked my train trip ! Leaving on January 11 and arriving in Seattle on the 14th . Then leave for San < PROPFIRST > on the 20th . Can't wait to see my dear friends in the Pacific Northwest before heading to California for my winter respite ! 
I'm driving cross-country with my sister < PROPFEMALE > , on my way home after 3 months in So . Cal . We only made it 318 < PROPMALE > yesterday due to icy roads and jackknifed trucks outside of Flagstaff AZ . Hope to make it to Amarillo today . 
In Roanoke VA for the night . Will be home tomorrow afternoon ! 
So glad to be home . Arrived at about 3:30 and have already gotten hugs from a few of my favorite friends . The trip across I 40 was full of laughs and giggles with < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > . 
Although it is a little fuzzy , I love this picture because it captures all the fun I had yesterday with the Smith's and Haag's at Ocean Beach . I didn't want to come out of the water ! 
I am fascinated by the Coffee Party 
Thanks to my sister < PROPFEMALE > for the link to the Dancing at the Movies clip 
Thanks to my new friend < PROPFEMALE > for the new profile photo . I had a ball with her , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE > this last week-end on Cape Cod 
Having a wonderful time in Ontario with < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > Pike . \ 
Just added pix from Niagara Falls . 
On the bus from NyC to DC for the rally to restore sanity ! 
< PROPFEMALE > with the flip side of her sign 
I just a few more pictures from Saturday . 
I got a new Lens for my camera last week and am just starting to play with it . 
\Spend the time admiring the immense power of your own tender heart and be there when that happens . \ " \ 
I just posted a new profile picture . It is the first portrait < PROPFIRST > and I have had taken in 18 years . We are rarely this formal but I like the picture 
My profile picture was taken the year I was almost 7 . My older sister was on the other side of the chalkboard . This was one of the greatest present ever . 
Profile picture is my first Christmas . My sister was happy with her doll , grandpa was getting a kick out of it and I was NOT HAPPY ! 
I've obviously been going through old family pictures for a project . Here I was on the \range\ " in Oregon in 1954 "

We didn't have as much snow as many people in the Northeast did but it was enough to < PROPFEMALE > at and shovel ! 
Just saw \True Grit\ " with < PROPFIRST > . It is superb . Really absorbing . " 
My status picture was taken 60 years ago today , on my first birthday . I always think of my birthday in conjunction with my mom Tink's birthday . Hers was January 17 . She always reminded me that I had been a late Christmas present but an early birthday present for her . She was the best . \ 
Thanks to all of you who think of me today and wish me the best . It means a lot to me . 
Finish each day and be done with it . You have done what you could . Some blunders and absurdities have crept in ; forget them as soon as you can . \ 
Tomorrow is a new day . You shall begin it serenely and with too high a spirit to be encumbered with your old nonsense . \

I'm in Washington DC's Union Station and will get on the train Chicago in a few minutes . Love rail travel ! 
These two things will add greatly to my enjoyment of the trip ! 
I've made it to the wonderful Pacific Northwest and am in for the night in my own home of Tacoma . So much has changed , but a lot is still much the same . Have lots of special friends to see in the next few days but will post a few stories about the train later . The reason I took so few pictures on the two day trip from Chicago is that all we saw was snow , more snow and then again snow . 
Actually , a hotel , not my old home . 
I had a wonderful , but short visit to the Glass Museum in Tacoma . Here are a few of < PROPFIRST > Chihuly's amazing works . 
Thanks to heads up from < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > . I DID NOT mean to send anything about the app for finding out about \CREEPS\ " . Sorry " 
I am still thoroughly enjoying my visit to the West Coast . Lots of good time with family and friends and LA . Will be here through the end of March 
My new profile picture was taken this Wednesday in the Northern California redwoods . I have more pictures to post in awhile 
Uploading a few pix from my drive down the Oregon coast 
Ouch ! \ 
I sprained my back today doing something inconsequential . My sister had to call the paramedics because I couldn't stand up . CUTE GUYS and my first time at Arcadia Methodist's ER . I've spent lots of time there over the years visiting others , but this was my day . < PROPFEMALE > and I laughed a lot and the two morphine shots finally kicked in so I could come back to her house . \ 
Silly , silly , silly 
I'm back on my feet again ! After three days flat on my back I was able to walk a little on Saturday and Sunday . After a visit to an acupuncturist today I'm so much better . I'll get three more treatments before I get on the California Zephyr Amtrak next Tuesday . Thanks for the good thoughts ! 
Just left my LA home for the train ride to my New Jersey home . More than a few tears this time leaving . Love all of you who shared your time with me on this visit . Sorry if we didn't get enough time ....... 
Back home and completely unpacked . Tomorrow I focus on finishing our taxes . Internet was down til this afternoon . Will post more trip pix soon .
