doing alright . stying busy as always . 

My step dad passed away yesterday morning . It has been a very difficult time for my family . My son < PROPFEMALE > is taking it really hard , but trying not to show it . He's trying to be srong for me and his grandma . Please keep my family in all your prayer right now . We need them . 
They say time heals all woundes , so then when does the pain go away ? 
why do men ly ? 
I know that not all men are bad , but it sucks when you finally trust someone only to have them break that trust . Then they have the gutts to try to make seem like they've done nothing wrong . 
I'm sorry but isn't having someone move in before you break up cheating . 
Went out with an old friend . It was nice to get away for a while . 
Time to stop felling so mad about the things that I can not change and get on with life . 
It is amazing when someone makes ya fell like you don't matter , just how totally amazing friends can be . I might be bad a picking relationships , but not friends cause I have the best ones ever ! Thank you to all true friends !!!! 
It is time for a nice hot bubble bath . lol . Then to finish homework . 
New beginings can be awsome !! 
True friends are few & far between , so be sure to let them know just how important they are to you .

WOMEN'S ASS SIZE STUDY ... There is a new study about women and how they feel about their asses ... the results were pretty interesting ... 30% of women think their ass is too fat ... 10% of women think their ass is too skinny ... The remaining 60% say they don't care , they love him , he's a good man and they wouldn't trade him for the world .... I know you're laughing !! Feel free to repost this if you love your ass . 
So tired of being sick . Wish this crud would just go away already . 
believe in the right to keep and bear arms . One Facebook has challenged all gun owners to put this on their wall . The Supreme Court of the United States has affirmed that the right to keep and bear arms is a fundamental right of the individual . If you Believe in the 2nd Amendment and you are not afraid to show it , re-post this . Lock n Load 
A good Momma thinks about her children day and night . A good Momma loves her children in a way that they will never understand . A Momma will be there for her children when no one else will . A good Momma would take a bullet , stand in front of a train , and ask God to take her instead of her child . If you have a child or children that you love as much as I love mine , post this as your status . 
Just got done for the day & ready to pass out . lol . Night everyone . 
Well , I'm going to be here at Ft Chaffee for 1 more week . lol . 
Well I'm plum tired everyone so I'm going to call it a night . Good night to all my friends ( ya know who ya are ) . lol 
I make mistakes being a Mom ( sometimes more than I would like to admit ) . But I will always be there for you , to hear you , to cheer for you , to laugh or cry with you , to protect you with my life , and to love you for eternity with all my heart . No one will EVER love you more than I do , I'm your Mom ! Re-post if you have children , that will always be in your ? 
The Girl you just called fat ? She has been starving herself & has lost over 30lbs . The Boy you just called stupid ? He has a learning disability & studies over 4hrs a night . The Girl you just called ugly ? She spends hours putting makeup on hoping people will like her . The Boy you just tripped ? He is abused enough at home . There's a lot more to people than you think . Put this as your status if you're against bullying 
Good night everyone !!
