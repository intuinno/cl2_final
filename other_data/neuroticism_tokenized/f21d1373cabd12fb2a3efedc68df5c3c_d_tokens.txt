Hi HI !!! :P 
( sigh ) 
I has my own internets !!!!! 
Always waiting for my Cody-kun ... 
People who I once thought were my friends no longer are ... Anyone know how to set up a block list . Please tell me if you do . 
I hope my life improves a little soon ... 
You dont like me ? Great ! That makes you one less person i have to worry about ! Thank you and have a good day ! 
knows that there comes a time when you get tired of trying to help people ... it's not a sign of giving up , but a sign that you don't need them in your life ! 
I wish I had the courage to kill myself and ened this nonsensical existence ... But I made a promise to the most important person to me that I would never try that again ... Now he won't even take the time to try to help or understand me ... I feel like I'm already dead , so why won't God take mercy on me and end it ? What sort of sick kick does fate get out of watching me flail around like this ? 
... I just want you to put you're arms around me , to hold me tight and tell me you still love me , want me and that's its going to be OK ! 
remember that time you said you would never give up on me ? because you loved me too much ? what happened to that ? 
can only be broken so many times before she can't be fixed anymore 
Sigh 
Really wants to see < PROPFIRST > ... 
I love my straight-jacket ... It gives great hugs :) 
Soooo bored ... and yet I can't sleep a wink .... This sucks . 
Love isn't about finding the perfect person ; it's about seeing an imperfect person perfectly . 
I don't need to talk behind your back because unlike you if I have something to say , I've got the balls to say it to your face . If you'd even have the balls to show it . 
Find the guy that calls you , beautiful instead of hot . That will kiss you in front of his friends , and get along with yours , and that wont break your heart :) 
I really wanna get out and have some fun ...

I'm not in this world to live up to your expectations and you're not in this world to live up to mine . ~ Bruce < PROPFIRST > 
one of my cats got ran over , and me and < PROPFIRST > seem to always be arguing now ........

Soooo Bored ..... 
I hate being off my sleep schedule ........... I must be crazy to stay up past 3am all week ... 
The church 
wants to remind others that God didn't bring you this far just to drop you off ! Stay positive ! :-D 
I woke up at 15 til 3 am after a nightmare and can't go back to sleep , since it left an impression on my heart of some bad things I've been trying not to think about ... 
Planning to go for a walk through town in a bit ; anyone wanna come ? 
I just woke up and my entire body practically hurts like heck ..... I walked way too much yesterday so my legs are throbbing and I also just started my period today , so I have the cramps and back ache that come with it , and there are NO pain meds in the house ... :( 
Can't wait til this weekend !!!

Bored now that the excitment of the festival has died down . 
WOW I kinda abandoned this site for a while , but I get bored enough to visit at times :) http://yearbook.com/a/os0v2?ref=nf 
Bored and stressed . Yep , that's it ... 
I'M TOTALLY FREAKING OUT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
I'm calmer now , but still worried ... 
They say its bad to eat late night snacks ... but then why do they put lights in refrigerators ??? 
Night is usually for sleep and Morning is usually for you to be awake , so why is it do I feel like sleeping all morning and staying up all night ..? 
I'll be gone from the 31st through Nov . 7th or 9th . 
I'm back

I want to feel your touch , I want to kiss you , but at this moment I can't cause we are < PROPMALE > apart . But I will wait for the < PROPMALE > to finally be with you . 
I got my test scores back .......... I'm ONE FREAKIN ' POINT short of a < PROPMALE > for great scholarship ....... stupid math was the death of me ........... So I don't know how I'll pay or what will work out now ..... ( Feeling hopeless , dejected , and REALLY dumb )

I finally changed my picture for my favorite cartoon when I was little . CARDCAPTORS ! Well , its anime really , but oh well . 
My pic is me again now , since someone sent me a disturbing message saying this cartoon pic thing was started by pedophiles , so just in case that is true ... I got rid of my cartoon pic . 
Silent night , Holy night ... :) 
idk what to do ....... my life is never going to go right ................ ( W )

Bored and anxious ... 
OK , so I am suppossed to be moving into my dorm at Webster U in St. < PROPFIRST > in the morning , but my ride is sick and says she may not come get me . So .... Any of my friends want a road trip in the morning ? Pwease ??? :3 
I am now moved into my dorm ! Thanks to so much help from my church and < PROPFIRST > ! :) I still have a lot to do though to be really ready , so wish me luck and pray for me ! 
First day in dorm ..... BORING ... I have nothing to do and nowhere is open on campus . Not even the cafeteria is open ... 
I pray to God to give me strength and wisdom to get through this first week in college as well as possible and get done what I need to get done , and all those who read this and believe please pray for me . Thanks . 
SNOW ! IT'S SNOWING ! :) 
So tired ............. I am sick and have been running around campus like mad trying to get all sorts of important things done , but things keep getting in the way of me finishing the MOST important things ..... 
Good night soon .... I have a 7 am wake up call ........... 
I have a date all day with Cody-kun tomorrow ! XD I am SO excited ! XD 
OK I have been sick for like 3 weeks and I am GOING INSANE !!!!! I even went to the doctor and handed them like 60 bucks to make me better and what they gave ISN'T HELPING !!!!!!!!!!!! GGGGAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
My head is throbbing and I have a lot of homework to do tonight if I want to stay ahead a day ... Need sleep , but its hard to come by in college ... I'll pull through though . :) 
Class is canceled today because of snow , so I miss my very first quiz until Tues . LOL :D 
I got to spend the day with < PROPFIRST > ! :D I feel much more relaxed and happy now ! Ready to take on another week of college on Monday ! I'm gonna do my best ! 
O-yasumi nasai ! 
SO much to do this week ...... I hope I can make it ...... 
Group projects in college are never a good idea ......... 
I auditioned for my first college play ..... I didn't make the cut ...... :'( Apparently a lot more people came than they thought they would have , and they had few roles ........ :( ( sigh ) 
Bored ...... There is stuff I could do but nothing seems good ... 
Got back a bit ago from visiting my parents in Piedmont for the weekend . It was nice , but I am happy to be back in Webster as well . :D 
I have so much homework my head might explode from pressure ... 
I feel so restless tonight , yet can't seem to focus on my homework ... 
My spring break is March 7-11 , is it too early to start counting down the days ? ;) 
I had a good V-Day . XD 
Needs to be able to get out of the dorm and do something fun more often .... The weather is AMAZING , and I'm sitting here studying ... 
I have a ton of homework to do to get ready for midterms ......... I have to do it all today ..... ugh ..... 
My first midterm is at 9 am tomorrow ...... I am scared ..... 
So tired and worn out .... Can't wait til spring break after next week ... 
Hurry up spring break !!! 
Eating warheads ..... YUM My FAV < PROPFEMALE > ever ! Thanks for buying some for me < PROPFIRST > !!! 
Enjoying some rest and relaxation on Spring Break in Piedmont this week til Thurday . ( yawn ) 
I'll be heading back up to St. < PROPFIRST > in the EARLY morning . I mean leaving here at 6 am early ... Not looking forward to waking up then , but I'll be glad to be back up there . I had a nice , restful break so far , and now the fun will start with the kawakon anime convention I'll be attending all weekend . XD 
Making homemade brownies cause I am bored LOL 
Had so much fun at kawakon all weekend , but now back to college classes in the morning ....... It's gonna be tough to get back into the swing of things again . 
So bored .... Spring break just ended and I already want summer to be here ! 
When you < PROPFEMALE > the Bible , Satan gets a headache . When you open it , he collapses . When he sees you reading it , he faints . When he sees you living it , he flees . And just when you're about to re-post this , he'll try to discourage you .. Any takers ?? 
I am tired and not feeling great ... I think me and my roommate are both catching something ... :( Have a feeling this week will be rough . 
Its SOOOOOOOOOannoying trying to get ringtones on my new phone !!!!!!!! :'( 
Tired .... its snowing .... and I have a paper , project , and a play scene to do ... 
Don't you hate when your whole day is great , but then one thing goes horribly wrong at the end of it , and all the good is just gone ......? 
I GOTTA stop looking at < PROPFEMALE > and anime cosplay costumes .... I'll end up driving myself into debt out of want ... But I haven't spent any on it in a long time , so I have better control .... 
BEST ...... MONDAY .... EVER .... Now time to crash .....
