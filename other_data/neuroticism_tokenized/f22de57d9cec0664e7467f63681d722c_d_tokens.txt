Just a lazy day at the condo . The < PROPMALE > show The 4400 is AMAZING ! 
Taking it easy today . Dad is coming over later on today before he goes home to Columbia Ky . 
Had a great time today . Back to work in the morning :( 
If work was fun , we would have to pay our boss ....

Going to morehead for coffee !!! The Fuzzy Duck is a million times better than starbucks . Its well worth the 60 < PROPMALE > to get it . Did I mention that an addicted .?.?.? 
I drove all the way to morehead and didnt find the coffee shop !! so I went to hardees instead .

Ok , I’m tired of hearing about second hand smoke ... Now I'm hearing about third hand smoke . This whole thing is starting to get out of hand ... I would just like to put it out there that smokers are people too . People with rights I might add . With the cost of tobacco products on the rise , smoke is becoming somewhat of a costly thing . This is why I am declaring that second hand smoke is now a free sample .
