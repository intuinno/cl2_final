No one should die because they cannot afford health care , and no one should go broke because they get sick . If you agree , please post this as your status for the rest of the day . :)

FACEBOOK TRICK : press up , up , down , down , left , right , left , right , B , A , Enter key , then right click then press up and down and magic crcles will appear . The only way to get rid of them are to log off or refresh the page ... IT WILL WORK ! Put this as your status if it works ! 
I've probably yawned 25 different times already today . Am I really that tired ? 
Making a video ! :D 
He slumbers sweetly on my heart , my guardian angel sang lullabies . Now I can happily and lightly enjoy every flower , and every leaf and every petal ... Nightingale , soft - wake not my Cupid with your song . 
What would happen if I hired two private investigators to follow each other ? 
Dear Thanksgiving , I'm sorry you're being underappreciated because of the Christmas chaos . I still remember you . :) 
familiar sights can bring immense comfort . 
Loves the way white grape sparkling cider makes me feel all bubbly after eating turkey . :) 
Drove for the first time in three months yesterday . I miss my car ! :(

' Ello chaps . ' Tis a fine day to speak in such a distinguished manner , eh ? I do love this accent , and I intend on commiting to it all day today . Right then ... Cordially , < PROPFEMALE > . 
I love weddings . I try not to cry , but it's just so darn beautiful . Also , I sacrificed my tastebuds to the horridness that is champange only for the toasts ... how can people stomach that stuff ? 
I had some cookies , some fudge , and a Dr. Pepper in the last 5 hours . It's way too easy to get a sugar high at my grandparent's house . Haha . :) 
There's this large present sitting in my grandparent's living room for me ... soooo tempted to open it ! 
I appearently have some cousins that knew me from when I was like 5 years old , but I feel like I met them for the very first time tonight . 
Know what I love about getting a new CD ? Opening the cover booklet and finding this written inside : All praise and < PROPFEMALE > to Jesus Christ , to whom I owe everything .

Today's weather is exhilarating . The closer to spring , the happier I become . 
Procrastinating once again ... 
I got a pocketful of sunshine . It kinda burns though . 
A rhyme in my time is a chime in my head , but every now and then it's my partner in crime . 
\I feel all British and such ... but oh dang it ! I'm a hippie today ! \ " < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > " 
Sunshine , on my shoulder , makes me happy . n_n 
Rediscovering an old hobby .

It's only Tuesday ? Wow ... Upside : Glee's on tonight ! 
Another goal for the summer : Go from ghost white , to ... maybe the color of a slice of wheat bread . 
Is there no end to my boredom ?

< PROPFEMALE > day in St. Regis visiting relatives : nice . Getting laughed at by my 12 year old cousin as I attempt tirelessly to conquer a video game : laughably priceless . 
I wrote my very first song !! :))) 
Sooooo , I have a question . What are you supposed to do when you're in a bowling alley and an woman , who may or may not be a little drunk , comes up to you and starts up a random conversation like she's known you for years , and then awkwardly stands next to you and watches you play pool ? 
Friday : free smoothie for wearing flip-flops ! 
God is my victory and he is here . 
Toy Story 3 was AWESOME POSSUM ! :) 
Certainly didn't feel like the summer solstice today . :(

This night owl sometimes wishes she were an early bird ... sometimes . 
Exhausted , but I don't know why . 
\With all the fury of a mystery ... \"" 
I never , ever drink energy drinks . They taste horrible . But when I had to look forward to 7 hours of running around the Food Farm , I opted for one of those 5-hour Energy thingys . 5 hours worth of energy + my raw , hyper energy = skipping and twirling up and down the isles . :) 
begins cashier training today . Feeling anxcited . ( anxious and excited at the same time ) 
Ah , Saturday evening . 
Floating this afternoon was AWESOME ! Despite my run-in with a huge rock that capsized me and my tube . Hehe . :P 
I want an adventure . A wildly exciting and thrilling adventure . Rush of adrenaline pumping through my veins . I want an adventure . 
* Brooklyn accent * Oh my gawsh , I'm gettin ' so lyrical up in here ! 
I found a fortune in a shopping basket today that reads : \A great pleasure in life is doing what others say you can't . \"" 
Step in and potentially make things worse , or not get involved in the drama and let the feuding continue ? I hate being a third wheel . :( 
What's on my mind ? Cerebrospinal fluid , I would assume . 
Today is so much better . 
really wanted to jump in the enormous puddles from the storm . 
Finally finished my song ... and I looooove it . Yay for spontaneous inspiration ! :D 
Anyone know of any nice , cheap bedroom furniture I can possibly have ?

sighs in relief as an exhausting , but eventful day has come to a close . < PROPFEMALE > also thinks that the year is going to be .... an adventure . :) 
So tell me darling , do you wish we'd fall in love ? All the time ... all the time .

My next splurge : professional Swedish massage . Ah yes . 
Amazing how this year , Monday's are actually bearable while I have to prepare for the craziness of Tuesdays ... but I conquer them every time . 
How can I keep from singing ? God captures my heart . Sunshine warms my soul . Friendship kindles my spirit . Smiles never cease . :) 
Is in love with an amazing man\\n \¡§§"

I think coffee is starting to get to me . I was so jittery and shaky from just one cup this morning . Upside : I got A LOT of things done today .

A change from the normal routine is so refreshing ! 
It's so quiet in the house right now ... 
marshmallow mosh ! 
Relaxing on the couch on a Friday night . Yes . 
Saw so many people today ... and I haven't even left the house at all ! 
Currently laying in a dogpile of about 8 people on the ground in front of the UC at 5am waiting to get tix for the Cat/Griz game . Awesome . :) 
Bahahaha !! I have infiltrated enemy territory . Oh the things I can do to < PROPFEMALE>'s facebook right now . Heh heh ... 
After a long night at work , coming home to hot chocolate and a flurry of FB surprises from a Mr. < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > is just what I needed . Rachaelface has a smiley face . :)

Can't wait for all my roomies to be here so that the semester can officially start ! 
So many dynamic personalities in the house ... this is going to be interesting . 
What an awesome day ! Perfect walking weather , and so much that makes me smile .... like discovering new music while drinking coffee with a friend , a delicious Snapple Grape < PROPFIRST > Punch drink , the sun shining , and just having a warm fuzzy feeling inside . :) :) 
If I said I was thoroughly disappointed that I have to work on < PROPFIRST>'s Day , I'd be lying . Selling wine and condoms to adorable couples is well worth it when I go home afterwards and enjoy an evening to myself . :) 
God of wonders ... surprises ... and excitement beyond belief !! 
Ski retreat was awesome ! Beautiful , < PROPFEMALE > day to ski with some pretty fantastic people . :) 
Snail reunion was awesome thanks to < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > Doney . Love you guys ! \@____"
