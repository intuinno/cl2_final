very hungry , thirsty and looked like they didn't have direction . I \ 
don't know what to do as I can't keep them and my \ 
yard is not fenced . H E L P ! ! ! ! ! ! !

neutered ... I can't keep them , I have no fence and my roommate wants to \ 
get rid of them in the most cruel way ... PLEASE !!! 
Just came back from Ashdown , Arkansas where I met a wonderful family . They took the pups and promissed that they will take good care of them . I contributed to buying some food for the pups . Nothing is too much to thank them for being so kind !

Why most of the people think that I am a deaf \ 
idiot and they need to show me that they know what I need , how I need \ 
whatever they give me , and in which amount ? Just because I have a funny \ 
accent ? Or because they think that I owe them something and that I don't deserve what I have without their contribution ?
