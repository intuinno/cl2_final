Fun with < PROPMALE > . :) 

Cold , hot , cold , hot . Make up your mind , weather ! Churching and Baptism this Sunday . See you there ! :) 
IT'S A BOY !!!!! 
I seem unable to keep from engaging in useless exercises ... 
LJBHFIUSJDLJHNGISUBVKJXN FJHVGBZLKFJKRUG !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
However did I get so many friends ? These things just seem to sneek up on one , don't they ? 
I just saw a movie with that guy with a crooked nose and , guess what ? I actually liked his acting ! :: gasp :: 
The yummiful delights of chips and salsa . :: smacks her lips and licks of her finger :: MmmHmm ! 
Today , it's home fries with onions and an egg thrown over the top . Smothered in ketchup . :: drools , just a little :: 
Enjoying her weekend with Siah and Fayna . Woot ^.^ 
Zo the kveztion iz , vat vould Mikhael Jakk-zon doo ? 
I miss the fast-paced walls of the Petition group , but I have no < PROPFEMALE > to flirt shamelessly or discuss politics , as no longer interest me any more . It's a shame really , those days had been so much fun ... 
What , not man enough to keep up so many threads ? 
MEAT ! Good riddance , days of fasting . 
Baby registry . Fun times . 
I don't care if I'm going to have to throw up in a half hour from lying down . I'm too friggin tired . TO HELL WITH SITTING UP ALL NIGHT , as though I'm going to avoid the inevitable . 
Miserable failure . Now my tummy's so upset ... :: pouts and whines and bitches and moans :: 
Baby is now 1 lb . Such a big boy ! 
:: insert various random complaints here :: 
I want < PROPFEMALE > ! 
The original Kite isn't a quarter as good as the hentai . No exploding bullets ???!!!? 
I'm not racist , < PROPFIRST > ! I'm extremely politically incorrect ! 
< PROPFIRST > needs to take me out to see New < PROPFEMALE > ... :: hint :: hint :: nudge :: nudge :: wink :: wink :: 
No , wait , Kite has exploding bullets in this one ... that never explode . Wtf ? 
I wonder if there really is anything I'm missing by not watching TV ... Prolly not . 
The more time I spend online , the more stupid I become ... 
Wonders how being American = large boobs and Bibles . 
I just noticed we have PINK tissues in our Kleenex box . That's messed up . 
Currently looking up Kegel's exercises . Does anyone on here know anything about the Pink < PROPFEMALE > ? 
Hmm ... Know more than she ever wanted to about Kegel's , and is now more interested in \Jing\ " and \ " Qi \"." 
Now gets it , the Jign Qi Shen thing , but was not really satisfied with such limited information as she was given . 
I finally got why I thought Mr. Cook was so amazingly awesome ... besides the fact that he was gorgeous . 
Is getting confused reading words like \Heterotic\ " and \ " hadrons\ " right next to each other ... " 
I've found out it's Cannizzaro I want , but can't seem to find the right article he wrote ... I wish I knew where my Freshman Lab < PROPMALE > thing was ... :: grr :: 
Baby belly is getting bigger every day . My boy is having his growth spurt . I'm so happy . ^.^ 
I wish I had Photoshop ... for real . 
I want to meet a hornless unicorn ... 
Wrapping presents for her nephew's 3rd B-Day . Omg , is he getting big ! ^.^ Woot for little boys . 
I would be feeling excited about all this kicking and rolling if my stomach could be happy about it , too . :( 
Happy Birthday , < PROPMALE > . >.< 
:: takes a deep breath , and reminds herself to smile :: 
\Adderall has shone no adverse affects in breast-fed babies up to 24 mos . \ " BOO-YAH ! " 
Looking for a maternity dress for going to < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE>'s wedding ... What size am I now , anyway ??? 
... I have my suspicions ... 
You know there's something going on when you're away for 3 days from your FaceBook and you have 56 new notifications ... Yep , < PROPMALE > and Syd are wallin ' it up , as usual . I just happened to miss this session ... 
It's amazing how much one can miss the camaraderie shared across a pond ( the size of an ocean ) via FaceBook and hardly even notice it ... 
It's because you make no sense . Ergo , I can be okay with the resulting play-acting at dislike . There is a difference between disinterest and dislike , you know . The former , I do not mind . The latter , it must be said , cannot have been due to my own faults . 
Knows Syd is secretly jealous of my oh-so-busy state of being . If only /she/ could be so constantly in flux ! ( Not to be mistaken , God forbid , with being in flux constantly . ) 
//Finally// heading off to bed ... :: yawns :: Na-night . 
I'm in the middle of an intense poking war . :: gives an unlady-like snort :: 
I wonder what I should cook today ... in order to have the excuse of following it up with some Bear Claw icecream . Yum ! 
I'm getting giddy with all this < PROPMALE > talk . :: gets that special < PROPFEMALE > in her eye :: 
Visiting today with < PROPFEMALE > . ^.^ Very happy day . 
He who goes to such lengths as to include all sexes in such a statement is an imbecile . 
Registering for college courses online now . AAHHHH ! So exciting . ( Except the part where I have to prove I'm a smarty-pants to get around prerequisite courses . Not fun . ) 
Baby is on a somersaulting marathon !! 
I actually sold the ugliest , most faded stuff ever ( in my estimation ) on eBay for more than I ever thought possible . Well , nearly sold , there's a few hours of bidding left . Posted it for dirt cheep , now it's selling at almost $40 . WOOHOO ! 
Dodge , duck , dip , dive , and ... Dodge . 
CALLING ALL HANDS TO THE PETITION GROUP WALL !!!!! 
Uber productive day : Picked out my computer for later purchase , got an estimate on my < PROPMALE > for school , sold everything on eBay and have everything ready to ship , AND got to shoot the shit on the Petition board a little . :) Awesome evening . 
Scroll down to the bottom of whatever Facebook < PROPFEMALE > you happen to be on . On the left you will see : Facebook @2009 English US . click on the English ( US ) link Choose English ( Pirate ) Enjoy ( Thank you < PROPFIRST >!) 
Had a cook-out and sleep over with < PROPFEMALE > and J . :) 
Honestly , there must be something wrong with me . I got to the /good/ part of this romance , and now I want nothing to do with it . Reading better novels again has ruined me ... 
Has trouble believing there's no such thing as s'mores in England . 
Listening to FOB and thinking of < PROPFIRST > . 
I have had an extremely productive and thoroughly exhausting day . It's been perfect . 
This has been the most ridiculous day EVER ! I wanted for 4 hours to see my doctor . :: fumes :: 
Talking to Steph on the phone + < PROPFIRST>'s coming over in a bit = Much happier < PROPFEMALE > . 
Leaving for < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE>'s wedding this weekend , then off to < PROPMALE>'s . Uber busy , get to spend time with all 5 sibs , AHHH ! :) 
< PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE>'s wedding was amazing . Off to < PROPMALE>'s for a week or so . 
Just watched Becoming < PROPFEMALE > . Awesome movie . :)) 
Lucky is just frickin awesome . He does his thing for a little while , then just curls up and falls asleep like a good puppy . So cute . 
I'm not saying you treated me unkind . You coulda done better , but I don't mind . You just kinda wasted my precious time ... but don't think twice , it's alright . 
A revolution without dancing is a revolution not worth having . 
Wishing I was as easily amused as all that ... 
I can't believe I got cricket , croquet , and croquettes mixed up . How messed up it that ? 
Today , I'll have all my records in to MDC . Classes start on Monday , though . AH ! 
For some reason , my ribs seem to fascinate my son . He keeps kicking and punching them . OMG , IT'S SO FRICKIN CUTE ! ^.^ 
When the thoughts that run through your head sound like they could have been written by Ms. < PROPFIRST > , one may be flattered by their intellectual capability . Now , if only one could start mentally depicting scenes and events in the style of Dickens ... 
Fun day with < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > . < PROPFIRST > , when I come home , I have need of your services ! 
Applying for classes , loans , grants , and all that other bullshizza is a pain in the arse . 
Isn't it wonderful when all of the pieces just seem to fall together like that ? 
Holy crap , the seventh month has just snuck up on me and BAM ! Seventh Months , Dude ! 
I can't find my perscription for the glucose testing I'm supposed to get done . How retardedis that ? 
Nother doctor visit today , but no ultrasound ... :( 
Baby's uber jumpy with that nice dose of coffee this morning . :) Half-way through the seventh month ! Crazy stuff , ain't it ? 
Dance contest last night was on fire , I heard . Congrats Keyz Diseaze ! 
Moving next week . Craaaaziness ! 
Wow , my Aunt < PROPFEMALE > just got in touch with me . Awesomeness ! 
I have , like , the COOLEST family ever . 
So my Dad's family is all befriending me at once . WOOHOO ! 
What ? Dad deleted his account . :( 
8 months and counting . Craaaaazy stuff ! 
Thursday = new Publix flyer and meal planning . 
My tummy is rumbling ! Meatloaf , scalloped potatoes , and one of my famous salads should fix that ... 
So I took a shower and shaved and spent all this time doing my hair for my appointment today ... that's not until tomorrow . DOH ! 
Okay , appointment /today/ . And Thursday = meal planning . funnest time of the week . 
Like my body isn't already hot and humid enough ... why can't fall be here officially ? 
I ? hate ? it when I lose at Free Cell . And that was such a stupid mistake ... 
** Correction ** I /hate/ it when I lose at Free Cell . And that was such a stupid mistake ... 
hot day , hot house , hot food . ick . 
Nothing better than a cool shower on a hot hot day . 
I & hearts ; < PROPFEMALE > Minogue . 
It is a sad day when Free Cell stops being fun . 
Watching Aeon Flux ... hope it's worth while . 
My mom is cooler than your mom . :: sticks out her tongue :: 
Watching a documentary on black holes . ( I now know how to spell that word . Woot ! ) 
So I looked up the Pink < PROPFEMALE > for better birthing and realized how much of it is PDF pages you need to print . It's like a 300pg PDF handbook , not a DVD like I thought . That's just not cool . 
Going out somewhere with < PROPFEMALE > tonight . What should we do , anyway ? 
All dressed up , waiting for < PROPFEMALE > to come home . Maybe get some pictures of tonight . :)) 
Looking up recipes . More flavor , please ! 
It's in the low 70's , all the windows open . SO EXCITING ! :)) Oh , and < PROPFIRST > P . is moving down to Boca . Life is so good to me . 
Time to get productive and clean this house . Moved around furniture last night in anticipation of all the baby things getting shipped ! SO EXCITE ! 
Today is October 20 . You know what that means ? 31 DAYS UNTIL MY DUE DATE ! 
FACEBOOK EXPERIMENT- If you are reading this , whether we do or do not speak often , please post a comment of your first memory of me . When finished , paste this paragraph into your status and see what happens . You'll be surprised what people remember about you ! 
Greatest line EVER . < PROPMALE > Cook ( mouth full ): Where's the handle ? 
WOOOHOOO ! I just got in my travel system , car seat , and swing . SO EXCITE ! 
Day 1 of < PROPFEMALE>'s Road Trip . Real excited for her . :) Plus , I get J all to myself . What isn't there to love ? 
Giid luck on your test tomorrow , Mom ! 
Good luck on your test tomorrow , Mom ! * 
My toe itches . 
< PROPFIRST > PHILLIPS IS COMING DOWN TOMORROW ! OMG , SO MUCH FUN ! 
J's taking a nap , then costume party . < PROPMALE > , the soldier ! I need a camera ... 
Trying to find my ACU's . Not much luck , as my PC has been swallowed in the abyss , and , even worse , / < PROPMALE > / has my pants . No fun , as I wanted to match J in his soldier outfit I bought him when I was in bootcamp . 
And oooh , oooh , the tummy ache ! Might as well spend this time cleaning house before < PROPFIRST > comes tomorrow . 
J's with Papa . Waiting for < PROPFIRST > to get into town ... 
< PROPFEMALE>'s back in town in one piece . She had an awesome time . < PROPFIRST > and I had a great time , too . I can't wait to see you again , lovey ! ( I'm sure < PROPFIRST > wouldn't mid , either . :)) 
/Dripping/ sweat . Hot night . Ick ... 
Happy Anniversary , Mom and < PROPFIRST > ! 
I'm supposed to get < PROPMALE>' crib today . SO EXCITING ! Happy Anniversary to Mom and < PROPFIRST > . Also , < PROPFIRST > goes home today . :( 
I'm craaaaaaving some ramen about now ... 
I never really got the whole pregnant-woman-needing-to-pee-all-the-time ... However , since < PROPMALE > has officially dropped ... 
How have I gotten away without cooking for this many days ? 
Really craving Waffle House about now ... 
Had fun out trick-or-treating with the fam . Will be posting pics later ! :) 
I love talking to Steph . :) 
< PROPMALE > is so darned active . I'm so happy . :) 
Why doesn't Farmville offer meat grinders to take care of these lost cows that keep wondering onto people's property ? 
Drop it drop it low girl . 
Key West with < PROPFIRST > today . :) 
Loving youuuuuuu , is easy cause you're beautiful . Dut-n-dut-n-do o-o oo . AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ! 
I had the bluuuues so bad one time , it put my face in a permanent frown . You know , I'm feeling so much better , I can cakewalk into town . :) 
Wow . Today , though I got a bunch done , I've felt miserable physically . These last few days look like they're totally going to suck . :( 
Turrrrrkey . Yum . Thanksgiving come early = awesome . 
Looking for a suitable movie to watch , but Hulu is still stuck in Horror Movie Land and the selection isn't all that great . Not that there aren't good horror movies on there , it's just I don't watch them . 
Went to the doctor today ... and still forgot to get the ball rolling on getting preregistered . Wow , how lame is that ? 
I knew there was a reason why I love < PROPFIRST > . I just needed to be reminded . We were , like , built to like each other . Someday there won't be some conflict of interest that we can spend more time together being comfortable in our own skins . 
Made up the last of that chicken ... instead of scooping the flour for the gravy out of the very full , brand new bag of flour , I decided I'd just tip the bag and shake a little in . Yeah , like that's going to happen . So I have some very sticky paste with chicken bits in it , and a bunch of flour on the stove ... the counter ... the floor ... between the stove and the counter which is like , impossible to sweep . I rock . 
Really , really , really hoping that these contractions keep regular . REALLY ! 
And another day of waiting ... 
Signing up for college classes this up-coming semester . HELLS YEAH ! :)) 
Hoping the is the OFFICIAL cold of winter that it won't go away . I'm very happy I have so many warm things for < PROPMALE > ! 
Went out to the carnival tonight . Going again tomorrow . LOVE walking around in this coooold weather . :) 
Another cooooold day . Taking J out to the park on a play date with his buds , < PROPMALE > and Jayden . Get my exercise on ! Later to the carnival , but who knows what else today has in store ? 
Went to sister < PROPFEMALE>'s baby shower today . So awesome hanging out with family ! They are really amazing people . Very nice day . :) 
I want to become a fan of the < PROPFEMALE > \Using HTML Even When It's Not Supported\ " . I wonder if there is one ... perhaps I'll have to make it ? " 
It's hard to make a meal plan when you don't know when you'll be in the hospital delivering a baby . Who ever knew I'd have to worry about these kinds of things ? Cause if I buy fresh meats ... they may not be so fresh by the time I get back to the kitchen . 
The Konami Code live on ! Press Up , Up , Down , Down , Left , Right , Left , Right , B , A , Enter key then right click Then press up & down & Magic circles will appear ! The only way to stop it is to log off or reload the < PROPFEMALE > ... IT WILL WORK ! Put this as your status IF IT WORKED FOR YOU ! 
My sometimes-tiny belly is currently carrying a 9LBS BABY ! Who would have ever guessed ? 
Fruit Loops are so delicious ! 
This is one of those instances where no news isn't good news . I WANT THERE TO BE NEWS , DANG IT ! 
This baby looks like he's waiting for Grammy to come into town before he comes , so it looks like I'll be needing to buy more perishables , despite my < PROPFEMALE > not to . 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > is on her way ! Congrats to Mom and Dad on their little girl . Can't wait to hear the news when she finally arrives ! 
Having back pain ... not sure I want to get excited at the thought of back labor , so I'm going to pretend like this is nothing but secretly hope it is something . Imagine < PROPMALE > coming on his due day ?! 
Tick tock tick tock ... 
About to head over to Papa's for our Slava ( it was yesterday , but we're celebrating today ) . Spraznikom ! Made some greenbean casserole and < PROPFEMALE > cobbler , and , of course , we're having a leg of lamb . Beast foods in the wooooorld ! :) We'll be missing your presence , Mom . 
I'm always excited when I get a bunch of updates all at once ... until I realize it's just a bunch of people commenting on one status update and it's nothing I want to comment on . :( I'm so silly . 
My backpack's got jets ! 
Totally had a dream last night on the horrors of things that could go wrong after having your baby . Not things wrong with < PROPMALE > , just things I could do wrong , you know ... I was still happy and contented feeling when I woke up because I'd got to hold him in my arms . :) 
And the verdict is ... 
< PROPMALE > and I have a scheudled induction tomorrow morning . I check into < PROPMALE > Memorial Hospital Holtz Children's Center at 6 AM . !!!!!!!!! YAY ! Hopefully He'll be here sometime tomorrow evening ? 
Off to bed . Wed : Leave at 4:30 AM , arrive at < PROPMALE > 6:00 . < PROPFEMALE > and Mom will be with me , so call them for details about everything else . I have a list ready of people to call tomorrow once < PROPMALE > gets here . Good night , and be back in a few days to post stats and pics . :) 
Thanks , < PROPFEMALE > , for posting the pics ! < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > Drake was born Movember 25 , 2009 , at 11:43 PM , weighing 8lbs 13oz , 20 7/8in . Tomorrow , I get to bring him home . Had a scare that he could have been very sick , but everything checked out normal after further observation . THANK GOD ! 
< PROPMALE > is safe at home ! ( Mommy is exhausted :)) 
Gave Marky-Marc his first bath today . ( No , I didn't submerge him or get his umbilical cord wet . ) He makes the cutest litle faces as he's waking up ! Caught up on sleep last night , but lost it all today by not napping . :( Tomorrow is a new start ... 
Wow , looked up a bunch of Proclaimers songs on Limewire and I reeeeeally like them . Woohoo , more new ( to me ) good music . :) 
I want to do what is best for < PROPMALE > . But what is best for < PROPMALE > ? And is it okay to forget about me ? 
Shower , shopping , cleaning house for fam coming into town , going insane ... All in a day's work . 
Marcys skept like a dream last night . :) 
??? d ? no ? o ? uo sI ?? ?? s ? d pu ? ? do ? ' s ?? s sI ?? ???? ? no ?? n ? I ? o ? ?? nou ? ???? s ??? no ? ? l 
My baby is beautiful , charming , inteligent , strong ... Every day is a blessing ! ( Can you tell < PROPMALE > isn't crying atm ? ) 
Hum Hallelujah . Just off the key of reason . 
Downloading a Christmas mix to play for < PROPFEMALE > when she gets home . :) 
SO HUNGRY !!!!!!!!!!!!!! HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUNNNNNNNNGRY ! I'll never lose weight at this rate ... :( 
Money is the world's curse . May the Lord smite me with it , and may I never recover ! 
Just saw , and cried over , two different movies . How is that ? These motherhood hormones must be getting to me ... or maybe it's just that this time I wasn't too caught up in being repulsed at Chava's appearance to feel sorry for her . And ... I think I'm getting used to smelling like baby vomit . ( I'm not changing clothes that many times a day to keep up with how often I get vomitted on . ) Oh , the joys of being a mom . 
What is with this ? All the Flight of the Conchords songs I just illegally downloaded for free like the wonderful American I am are shrappy radio or live recordings , nothing done in a studio . Seriously , why can't I steal my cake and eat it ? 
Frustrated because < PROPMALE > is frustrated . He can't be hungry still , but I'm feeding him anyway because he's eating . Watch , now he's going to vomit on me next time I pick him up to quieten him ... Life is complicated atm . 
< PROPMALE > hasn't thrown up in two days ! Maybe I might be doing something right finally ? 
Just took a shower . < PROPMALE > was just chillin when I went in ... but then he started crying , and I'm thinking , I need this , he's just got to cry for a little til I'm done . I turn off the water , and imediately , the crying stops . I walk over to his swing , he's dead asleep . Did I just imagine him crying ??? I'm so crazy ! 
Getting < PROPMALE > to the dentist was a total fail . :( Rescheduled for Saturday , but I'm putting away the bottles today , anyway . I'm tired of bottle feeding , pumping , the clean up ... and it's so not intimate or special to feed your baby with a bottle . Anyway , I was so excited , so looking forward , to getting him off the bottle today , I just can't delay another day . :) 
HOLY CRAP , MY ROOM IS CLEAN ! ftw ? Bunches of errands today . I'm so excited to be taking some pictures of the boys and decorating the tree . :)) 
It's hard to take a nap . :( Correction mistakes today ... and doin dishes . And making some din din . Shoodle , got laundry too . Really , taking a nap is way too difficult . 
< PROPMALE > and I sat together and listened to the rain this morning . The small pleasures of life ... :) 
< PROPMALE > , pointing to Marcus : Is this an angel ? Me : He's my little angel . < PROPMALE > : Yes , he is a little angel . He's my cousin . Yup . 
< PROPMALE > gave me his first smile today !!!!!!!!!!! 
< PROPFIRST > is coming home today . Where will we go ? OOoooh , I'm so happy . :) 
WORST time to deside to go grocery shopping during this torrential rain . It's much nicer to sit and listen to than it is to battle with two kids and two cars and a cart full of groceries . 
Getting ready for Christmas . I'll be at church for Passover supper on Christmas < PROPFEMALE > , too . See you there ! :) 
Wish You a < PROPFEMALE > Christmas ?? • *¨* • . ¸¸ ? ¸¸ . • *¨* • ?? ? ? ? I Wish You A < PROPFEMALE > Christmas ?? • *¨* • . ¸¸ ? ¸¸ . • *¨* • ?? ?? • *¨* • . ¸¸ ? ¸¸ . • *¨* • ??... And A Happy New Year !?? • *¨* • . ¸¸ ? ¸¸ . • *¨* • ??... [ Thank God for cut and paste :P ] 
< PROPFEMALE > CHRISTMAS ! CHRIST IS BORN ! We'll be up in Tampa tomorrow to see the fam . Can't wait to see y'all and show off the little man . :)) 
I hate it when people are as lazy as me . :( 
Eating some breakfast ( I remembered to eat breakfast two days in a row now ! :)) and before I know it I look down to scrape up my next bite and nothing's left . Busy day today . Get to see EZ !!! WOOOO ! 
Wow , what a funky start to 2011 ! Went out to go see the fireworks with < PROPMALE > ... bad idea . Maybe some other year . As VC said : Next ! 
Killer headache ! Ick ... :/ 
Mia < PROPFEMALE > is on her way . She's breech , though , keep her and < PROPFEMALE > in your prayers ! 
Correction : Guiseppe ( A BOY ! ) was born today , son of < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > . 7.5 lbs . CONGRATS ! Plus , I now have someone to pass all my boys clothes to . Woot ! 
I can make your bed rock . :) /Love it . / 
Purple . 
Sometimes , you know these amazing peopole , or maybe just one amazing person ... the fact slips your mind , and suddenly , you turn around , and those people , that person , is gone . Then you just wonder for years and years to come , WHAT THE HELL HAVE I DONE !? 
Craaaazy tired . Hristos Se Rodj . Great Christmas with the parents . I always love visiting with < PROPFEMALE > and Zoran . :) 
It's going down huge . 
Last day with Mom and Ez . I will miss you guys . :( Esp . Ez ! Be safe overseas . 
What the hell , why not ? : You get to ask me 1 question ( TO MY INBOX ) . It can be any question , about anything , no matter how crazy it is .... No catch ... Just between you and I .... No one else will ever know .... But I dare you to repost this and see what people ask you . 
The beginning of Wall E made me like the movie despite myself . The ending ... not so much . Btw ... < PROPMALE > HAS HUUUUGE DIMPLES ! So precious . 
Writing some killer papers for ENglish Comp II . I totally cheated to get into this class . Hooray , me ! 
< PROPMALE > got his first shots today . :( He is one unhappy camper . So ... what to have for dinner tonight ...? J would love some hotdogs cooked over a fire outside . It's just the right temp for that . :)) 
Watched Mansfield Park ... again . God , I love this movie . :: sighs :: I need to get my hands on more Austen novels , for real !!! Life , at the moment , is good . 
\Heaven for climate ! Hell for society ! \ " - < PROPMALE > Twain " 
Run mad as often as you choose , but do not faint ! 
Just found out that a Draker is the same as an ancient , or standard bearer . Cool . :) 
Isn't it amazing how one can look 20 lbs thinner simply by wearing one's correct size ? What a queer concept ! :P 
The thrill of getting a new book . Alright , correction : one I want to read . But still ... Books , how I do love thee ! 
Dear Life , stop being so confusing . Please ? It's not good for the nerves . Sincerely , < PROPFEMALE > . 
Don't you hate it when all of your new notifications are about quizzes so-and-so took and \OMG ! The Dark Lord is Back !! \"?" 
Over so quickly ! It stinks to have such a teaser ... yet I wouldn't take it back , I suppose . Anyone want to read the unedited first 260-some pages of Midnight Sun ? WARNING : The mistakes become more glaringly obvious as the chapters progress . By the end , I had trouble discerning the meaning in some places because of misspellings and words left out altogether . Can be quite peeving . 
Life is more than just complicated ... I'm dealing with it , I suppose ? 
< PROPFIRST > ( Phillips ) is coming for an extended visit most likely in about 2 mos . Holy crap , am I excited ! 
< PROPFIRST > coming to visit > Ginormous load of financial accounting homework . There's light at the end of this tunnel , I suppose . 
There are more than enough things I can say , but I think this says it all : Thank you , < PROPFEMALE > . 
Let's hope don't flunk my Financial Accounting course . It would be nice if I could continue to receive financial aid by maintaining good grades ... 
Working with < PROPFIRST > is going to be interesting . We openned the day with coffee and news articles , searched for and gathered up the supplies , and now we'll be meeting up in a little while to actually go to the job site . This is so awesome ! 
So ... working and school and baby is keeping me very busy . It's so awesome to be making money , though ! :) 
Thank you , Baby Jesus , for allowing me to understand my accounting homework this weekend . Extra Kudos to < PROPMALE > for answering my one million questions , all made on a seperate phone call apiece . 
Wow , just turned in my test for Financial Accounting , and I'm pretty sure I'm going to get an A ! What a turn around ... I'll let you guys know what the grade is . :) Making plans to be at < PROPFIRST>'s for a brithday dinner this Wednesday , then perhaps to Coconuts for their Lingerie Night . We'll see . :) :) 
Thank you , everyone , for your happy birthday wishes . Wow , that so makes my day ! I & hearts ; my friends . :) Had a great time with < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , and the boys at the birthday party J and < PROPMALE > threw for me . :)) 
Note to Marc : If you have more than one need at a time , it would help if you allowed me to address these needs in the order in which they occur to me . If I try to feed you , and you reject my overtures , I will assume you are not hungry , when in fact you are , but you just want me to change your diaper first . I would prefer not to spend an hour trying to soothe a ravenously hungry belly when it should be filled instead . 
Turned in my homework ON TIME for Financial Accounting ! :D Also , I get the material the first time around now , and I'm not constantly flipping through the book to double check myself . < strike > fml < /strike > 
Wow ... Child Support Enforcement is so jacked . At least the lady was nice ... :( 
I wanna make you move , because you're standing still ! 
Totally lost on how amazingly advanced my baby is ... So , infant development timeline , then work ! 
Temp scare with < PROPMALE > . He seems okay , though , and his temp turned out to be on the low end of normal . Cold hands can be so decieving ! Back to work , then ... 
So ... I'm totally watching a Disney Channel original movie . On purpose . Isn't that sad ? 
Can we forget about the things I said when I was drunk ? I didn't mean to call you that . 
My heart's as full as a baked potato . It's a shpadoinkle day ! 
Was going to put a link up for Pillow Pants from Clerks II ... Wow ! That movie is SO vulgar . I thought better of it . 
I hate Accounting , especially at the last minute . Six String Samurai was awesome , btw . 
Crying babies , bad weather , school work , brightwork ... Another day in paradise . 
My English papers , 9 times out of 10 , rock . I love writing papers , especially when no one is really critiquing them , anyway . 
Oh , gossip ! I love you like I love my beef : raw and juicy . Mmmm . 
When one befriends certain people , one loses the ability to express all the facets of her personality . I'm mostly thinking that this is a bad thing . 
JON : Studies show 80% of abused wives are abused by there husbands . SADE : The other 20% are abused by their children . HAHAHA ! 
In the dark I wait . Though I'm not sure if I am the snare , or the one being snared . Though I'm pretty sure there's some sort of trap set here ... 
I'm ready for a little retail therapy . Though it's hard to shop amid such dingy wares . Sometimes I despair of finding just the right item . I'm mostly hoping I'll one day be pleasantly suprised . 
< PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > in town , all at once . Killer night , dudes ! Mixed reviews on The Invention of Lying from each of my multiple personalities ... 
If it's tourist season ... why can't I shoot ' em ? Traffic today was HORRID ! Add a screaming baby to the mix , and those pauses where you have to wait for a break in the traffic take FOREVER . 
The weather is playing games with me . Threatening rain is not something I really want to play games with as I'm learning to varnish . I want to clock in hours , but I don't want to screw myself in the process ... 
The true minority is the individual . I can't tell you how often I'm judged and HATED ON for being white , Christian , and smart . Forget about knowing me , just look for those buzz traits , and I'm on your sh*t list . Why can't I have an activist group fighting for me , too ? 
All rocks go to heaven . 
Look at my horse . My horse is amazing . Give it a like . ( Mmm ! It tastes just like raisins ! ) 
I know I shall not find an answer at the bottom of you , but , drink on , dear boy , drink on ! 
Wow ... do an IMAGE search on Google and type in the word \what\ " . Check out the suggested image search . :P " 
Quote of the week : \We can only assume that when a vampire bites it in /Twilight/ they just burst into a cloud of puppies and rainbows . \"" 
Ren Fest today . Kicked my butt , I'm so exhausted ! It's been a great weekend with the boys , though . :)) Thanks to the girls who made this possible : < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > , y'all are awesome ! 
Feels like : I've got a bag full of crabs here . I'm going to put them in my mouth , oh yes ! ( Drags her bleeding mouth across town with a smile on her face . ) 
FINISHED MY TERM PAPER FOR MY ENGLISH CLASS ! :)) [ lost my flash drive so I can print it when I get to class tomorrow night . SHRAPPY ! ] 
Todays game - PLACE OF BIRTH ! Everyone please play ! You will find it interesting to know where your FB friends birth places are . Copy & paste this on your profile , then put your place of birth at the end of this sentence . >> Lakeland , FL << 
Narwhals , narwhals , swimming in the ocean , causing a commotion , coz they are so awesome . :) 
I hate having to listen to my baby cry himself to sleep . :( Much worse : holding him as he twists himself in my arms and cries himself to sleep . Goodnight , < PROPMALE > . 
< PROPMALE > ate Veggies for the first time today . Sweet potatoes , yum ! He LOVES it . So uber exciting . :)) YEAY ! 
< PROPMALE>'s going strong on his veggies . Next on the list , carrots . Let's hope they're as big a hit as the sweet potatoes . Gosh , so exciting ! >.< ^.^ >.< 
\Fear not the inedible . \"" 
Letting < PROPMALE > play with a plastic bag because they're so crinkly awesome ! Keeping a CLOSE eye on him for the fear of him swallowing the thing . :( < PROPMALE>'s fascination is worth the effort . 
All I need is half a < PROPMALE > , a second thought , a second glance to prove I got whatever it takes . :D 
But when life becomes astressin , who will I be s . o . s . ' n ? Nobody else but you . 
somewhere in my youth or childhood , I must have done something good . 
Got my new camera today . Thank you , Daddy ! < PROPMALE > and I will be taking lots and lots and lots of pictures . Are you ready , Facebook ? 
Reading some \Baby's First Year\ " books . Looks like I'm doing an AWESOME job . :) Life is so good . " 
My stomach was making the rumblies ... that only hands would satisfy . 
Holy Week . What a week ! 
< PROPMALE > and I are home from the hospital . He is feeling much better , though still a little weary of too much touching . ( All that pking and proding made for one unhappy baby . ) All of his tests came back negative/normal . Thank you for all your prayers/calls/visits/support ! & hearts ; 
Christ is Risen ! Christos Vokrese ! Christos Anesti ! Cristo ha resucitado ! :) I need a new bathing suit . 
I & hearts ; & hearts ; & hearts ; geeks ! We stick together ! :D 
Weaning < PROPMALE > isn't as hard emotionally as I thought it would be . Mostly because < PROPMALE > is taking to the bottle like a duck to water . It is still pretty saddening , though ... :( 
How come everything on a boat is so HARD ? One theory : it's so bloody hot . I mean , you stub your toe in the house , and it hurts and it really sucks . You stub your toe on the boat ... you're immobilized for an hour . NOT FUN ! 
< PROPMALE > may be lactose intolerant . :( I won't be on for a while . Bare with me . 
< PROPMALE > has taken a decided interest in books . Unfortunately , I don't think this interest has much to do with reading them . 
Hooked up the magicJack . Hit me up for my digits , as my cell phone does not work in the house . :) 
Visiting with the fam ( Dad and the sibs , nephews ) . Be back Thursday morning . Don't want to go back so early , but such is life . 
Happy Birthday , Dad ! :) 
We didn't get coke , but we got a lot of water and a few wine coolers . So far , two water bottles have been open and discarded before being empty . There are no wine coolers left . Having all of us 21+ this year is a def perk . :) 
Learn to agrue effectively , please . Ad hominem and ad bacculum statements do nothing more than prove your lack of education regarding making a sound argument . 
Bowling this afternoon . Got < PROPMALE > a jumperoo ! :)) Pictures of both to come . Also : < PROPMALE>'s first swim in the pool . AND Ez took some professional grade pictures of < PROPMALE > , many of which are spectacular . Thank you , < PROPMALE > ! 
My brother and I just spent our bonding time laughing at < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > jokes . This is because the fear of death is said to bring people closer together . 
Self motivation is a curious , wonderful thing . With continued effort , positive results may follow . I like the sound of that . :) 
Something really wonderul is happening , and it's so special that , for once , I don't feel like proclaiming it to all and sundry . Still , life feels wonderful right now . /I/ feel wonderful . :)) 
I'm not doing what I had planned to do today , and I think I'm okay with that . 
< PROPMALE > is so active , social , playful , and loving . No greater Mother's Day gift than simply being a mom ! 
What a wonderful first OFFICIAL Mother's Day . :) I love my son , I love being a MOMMY ! 
Wants a choccy with lark's vomit . 
< PROPMALE > has his first tooth hole ! He got it sometime today . This means he will be cutting his first tooth some time within the next few days . WOOHOO ! X ) 
Long day of travel ... was so worn out until that espresso . Thank you , < PROPFEMALE > ! ^.^ Now , the trouble is falling asleep ... 
Realizing who I am and where I am is not defined by a moment in life , but by the mean between all those fluctuations , is something of a challenge . And , you know what I think ? Bring it on ! 
A dyslexic man walks into a bra . \ 
\ 
A man walks into a bar with a slab of asphalt under his arm , and says : \ 
A beer please , and one for the road . \ 
:P 
< PROPMALE > took a 2 hour nap today . So exciting ! XD 
I DO NOT like the fact that FB asked me if I wanted to change my info to include links , then deleted everything I mentioned and left simply a string of links . How are we supposed to communicate anything REAL about ourselves through pages less credible and more proliferate than wiki and /not even picked out by myself/ ( in many cases) ? It's like ADHD on crack playing experimental jazz . Try to link that one , FB ! 
< PROPMALE > Brando helped me realize that men are beautiful in Mutiny on the Bounty . < PROPMALE > Crow just reaffirms that realization every time I see him . :) 
< PROPMALE > is wearing size 12 mos ... and quickly growing out of it . I don't even have any 18 mo clothes ! Time to hit up some second hand stores in MIA . < PROPFEMALE > Wintermeyer , you wanna come along ??? :) 
Whatever it is that Zig Ziglar says about doing what you have to do to be able to do what you want to do ... it still kinda sucks that you have to do it in that order . 
It's hard to convince someone else of something when there's no one to convince but yourself . 
< PROPMALE > is growing tooth #2 . Pictures to follow . :) 
Most annoying aspect of FB chain posts- the people copy the names of the person who started the post along with whatever rediculous thing is supposed to haunt your closet or ask you out on a date . Then post it . With the name . And the names accumulate . Seriously ? SERIOUSLY ? 
I want to go running with chicked . Dr. Strangelove was AWESOME . Hulu has some great picks , everyone ! 
I love Walkinh in Los < PROPFEMALE > . < PROPFEMALE > Micucci . AWESOME . :) 
< PROPMALE > is back home from his second day at school . ( I intentionally didn't say daycare ; he's in a Montessori school . ) Let me tell you , he was so extremely curious when he came home ! Grabbing on to everything , playing with whatever was within arm's reach . Of course , he seems to be teething again , so that might be his issue : the need to have SOMETHING to gnaw on . :P 
Registering for the Fall Semester ... only to realize registration isn't open for either FKCC or MDC . MDC doesn't even have a fall semester schedule up . So much for that ... We'll try again next month . 
Rainy days aren't all that great . Just worked during one , but then there's only so much work one can do when it's wet . Now what ? 
< PROPMALE > loves school . Mom loves that < PROPMALE > loves school . Summer camp is coming up next week . You know what that means ? BATHING SUIT TIME , MARKA-BABY ! 
Blissfully buzzing , sinfully good-looking , and watching the lightening light up the night sky from over the everglades in homestead . Life could not possibly be any better than this . Pity < PROPMALE > isn't old enough to stay awake and witness the show , yet . All in due time ... 
is PROACTIVE , not REACTIVE . 
You make me happy , grey skies or no . :) 
Rain bums me out . Looking for plane tickets ... 
Planning for a trip is one thing ... pying for it ? OH , CRAP ! You never realize how much money all this stuff is until it's money you no longer have . :( Is it worth it ? Ask < PROPMALE>'s Grandma . :) 
Alright , so , it's one thing to /plan/ on spending money , it's another to drop $150+ of product for a project that needs to be finished ASAP . So now , not only am I under pressure to finish this job , but I don't have enough supplies because I POURED IT INTO THE FREAKIN CANAL ! The Gulf : My Life :: BP : My propensity to FUCK UP . :( 
Forget it all . She takes refuge with her two most beloved companions : a book , and bed . Well , inanimate companions , at any rate . 
Nothing is known so seductive as past English poetry . I am in love . 
Exhausted . I really don't like this kind of exhausted , but I'm starting to feel as though it's the kind of exhausted that I should like . Like it's fun to not be fun . Ftw ? 
You like chocolate cake and chicken . You spend too much time in the kitchen ! 
Lots of restless energy , but physically exhausted . I think it's time for a nap , then time to get this house ship-shape for < PROPFIRST > coming home tonight . And life keeps on keeping on ... 
< PROPFIRST > is hookin it up tonight . Thank you ! Let's have some fun . :))) Can't wait ! 
After a little consideration ... < PROPFEMALE > realizes that baby + fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants is not the kind of mix she can stomach . Call it a weak constitution , but at least I'm owning up to it before it comes back to bite me in the ass . 
I guess it's not really considered hooky if it's technically unsafe to be working outside in this heat . And the Crown Vic is acting up . :/ Anyone care to look at it for me ? 
Oh , butter fingers ! 
Into a string sentence of words random .... 
Happy Father's Day , Dads ! ( My Dad , < PROPFIRST > , and < PROPFIRST > , especially . Praying for you all today . ) I love you , < PROPMALE > Drake :))))) 
Mama is sick , sick , sick . < PROPMALE > has been not quite himself , and they mention at the daycare that a bug has been going around ... and I get it while < PROPMALE > gets over it . :( 
Whatever bug I caught is over and done with , but I'm still drained from losing all those fluids and not eating since breakfast yesterday . Still taking recovery time . 
:( 
< PROPFEMALE > Clarke Dimich < PROPFEMALE > Drake < PROPFEMALE > Drake < PROPMALE > Drake < PROPMALE > Drake < PROPFIRST > Phillips @everyone else who should know . MARCS HAS TOOTH THREE AND FOUR NOW ! Pictures to follow . They're the two right outside his front teeth ( or , where is front teeth will be ) . YEAY ! :) 
Bringin < PROPMALE > to school . Then house clean up . We'll see how I feel as far as the rest of the day is concerned ... ??? 
Some undisclosed-and-thereby-coveted-but-not-neccessairly-desirable prize will be awarded to whoever guesses who that is in my profile picture . Someone should get it , eventually ... I hope ? :P 
< PROPFEMALE > Wintermeyer takes the cake ! It's < PROPFEMALE > Gay Harden , my celeb lookalike . YOU GO GIRL ! WOOPWOOP ! :P 
Getting ready to leave for MI tomorrow . Let's hope I'm not still sick , otherwise this trip will ... totally not work out . :/ See you tomorrow night , Mamabear ! 
In MI , having oodles of noodles of fun . :) So relaxing ! And FINALLY not sick . Life is good . < PROPMALE > is crawling ! YEAY ! >.< 
is thinking about seeing what it will take to stay an extra day or two ? I've been so relaxed , and I love having so much time with < PROPMALE > . He's such a big boy eater ! ( Cottage cheese , grits , big-people oatmeal , and banana bits [ not mashed up but chewable bites ] included ) I moved him up to \Stage 3\ " crawler foods . Exciting ! Half-heartedly preparing myself to be back at home ... " 
Back home . Such a long day of travel ! I had a wonderful time , and it was just enough without being too much . I'm ready to get back to the regularity that was . 
One's circustances do not define him . It is his personal equilibrium and consistency that respond to life's opportunities and setbacks ; he is not what he owns or what he has accomplished at the present moment , but the collection of responses he has made to those things life has thrown at him . It is a good indication of his character in any actualization of his < PROPFEMALE > . Might I attain such stability in my life ! 
Left my phone with < PROPMALE > on accident . :/ Looking for a new job , too . :) It's all in the balance . 
Home with baby today , feeding him all the yummies he got to enjoy at Grandma's . :) FINALLY taking the time to get the house cleaned up so he can explore at will . < PROPFEMALE > Clarke Dimich should know that he's looking for things across the room , then scoot-scooting to them . ^.^ Very exciting ! 
I'm going to be walking out to the Marriot to watch the fireworks . Hit me up if you'll be there , too . :) 
So ... it started to rain , the fireworks show was already 45 mins late , and Gio and I desided to just go home ... and as soon as I'm home , I hear the fireworks going off . I wasn't too disappointed . I got to get out of the house and relax for a bit . Thanks , Gio . :) 
Oh crappy day ... [ oh crappy day ] 
Um ... Yahoo has started posting a live feed about the games I play when I'm logged in to my email account . Seriously ? I come to FB knowing people are going to be all up in my business , and I like knowing who knows what . This whole keeping tabs on me without my knowing it is just creepy ... even if the info isn't open to the public . 
One word : Saint . 
Oh . My . God . The tree in the front FELL OVER and crushed the Crown Vic about 15 mins ago . No one was hurt , thank Fod ! The tree FELL OVER ! Holy crap ... 
KLI is hiring ? Woop woop ! I'm so there . 
Dear Life , I & hates ; you . Sincerely , < PROPFEMALE > . 
I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass . And I'm all out of bubblegum ... 
I love my family . Oh , and < PROPFIRST > , you are soooo in the dog house . 
I am so angry , so ... angry . And I'm fast losing steam . Where does that leave me ? 
Back at work today . Holy crapper-doodle , it is HOT ! 
< PROPMALE > is pulling himself up to stand on his own perrogative . ( He has been standing up with me when I prompt him to try by holding a hand in front of him . Now he grabs hold of things on his own . ) From sitting down and lying down . Of course , I've never witnessed this , as he spends his days at school . :/ But , still , that's really , really , really awesome ! 
As I grow older , and become an adult in ways that count , I realize that the rewards I want have little to do with having material success ( money , position , authority ) but rather with a feeling of knowing I'm doing what will make me happy . This way , I'm not reliant on the whims of those things which I cannot control . It leaves little room to be shaken by exterior circumstance . 
I find I have to re-learn putting < PROPMALE > to bed on his own . Seperation anxiety has kicked in and he's just crying til I come , not crying casue he's tired . I praying for resilience now ... 
Um ... don't know really what's going on with < PROPMALE > . He's teething , that's for sure , but the crying continues even when he's not having teething pains . And he's been having a hard time with his bottle ( his top front teeth are coming in now ) . Can't wait for him to feel better ! :/ 
Alrigth , I got real artsy-fartsy with the pictures , and with a camera not built for that sort of stuff , but I was enjoying myself . 
Smile . Yes . Superior . Favor . < strike > Con < /strike > . It's amazing how the con can work without actually have to con anyone out of anything but feeling good -- even when they don't want to . 
Great minds think outside the bun . :) 
As I watch my son's small , inert sleeping form next to me , I realize all over again how in love I am . And , every time , it takes my breath away . I love you , < PROPMALE > . 
1 2 3 ONE . 1 6 3 TWO . 1 10 3 DONE . 
Does anyone know anything worth-while on Hulu right now ? Send some suggestions ! And -- I got < PROPMALE > squash , carrots , frozen fruit mix , chicken breasts , and sweat potatoe . Like , big people food ! Can't wait to feed it to him . :) 
< PROPMALE > put this HUGE scratch on my glasses by scraping them across the wall . Maybe that's a sign that I should stop letting him play with them ? :P I love him to explore , though . He's favorite teething toy is my keys . If it won't kill him or harm him in a serious manner , honestly , I'm all about him exploring his environment to the fullest ! 
Sometimes , I wonder why there needs to be all this subterfuge . As if a lousy piece of paper saying I took some classes and \passed\ " ( whatever that means ) will actually attest to my intelligence or knowledge . :: fumes :: " 
< PROPMALE > isn't feeling well . :/ He's been acting funny since Friday morning , and he's been on and off with a fever since Friday evening . Yesterday he seemed fine ; this morning , not so much . Calling the doc , see if I should just wait til tomorrow to being him in . 
< PROPMALE > is back to his happy little self . Aparently , the fever has little to do with the upsetness , which is just an earache from teething . :: phew :: A little Orajel , cold juice , and a teething toy has gotten matters under control . Thank You , Lord ! 
Memory Eternal : < PROPMALE > and < PROPFIRST > ( Stevo and VC ) . They passed last night in a car-crash . I'll be praying for you two , and especially for Panda . He's going to take this hard . 
< PROPMALE > rest , O Lord , upon the souls of Thy servants , < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > , who have fallen asleep in hope of the resurrection and life eternal . And < PROPMALE > them a place of rest , a place of verdure , where all sickness and sighing have fled away . And make their memory to be eternal . 
As I review what is going on in my life , and where I am in the schematic of achieving my goals , I realize that my current Step One needs some rethinking . It is up to me to be motivated enough , and strong enough , to make some bold moves and keep going forward . Thankfully , I am one strong , motivated woman ! 
Englishisms : What British-ish words , turns of phrase , pronunciations , or different spellings do you know ? Enlighten me ! 
Going to pick up < PROPMALE > . Seriously , does anyone have a copy of A&E Pride and Prejudice ? Please ! I need a sweetly-lacking-of-baltant-sexual-overtures romance about now , and P&P just hits the spot . :) I & hearts ; you , < PROPMALE > Firth . 
Baby : check . < PROPMALE > Firth : check . Baby has a Fever Again : check . Wait ... what !? All right , doctor tomorrow morning . 
You want a status update ? I am now an OFFICIAL owner of BBC's/A&E Pride and Prejudice , the two disc series starring < PROPMALE > Firth and < PROPFEMALE > Ehle ( to quote < PROPFEMALE > Z's Bridgit Jones , the one with the enormous breasts ) . Oh , gosh , my romantically inclined heart just died and went to the home theater . With a bag of kettle corn popcorn . And a nice comfy blanket . :: sighs :: 
Watching P&P . :) Made < PROPMALE > his dinners for the next week : boiled chicken with celery , onion , and < PROPFEMALE > flavoring ( and a bit of salt , duh ! ) , coocked carrots , and rice mashed up with the broth . I was so proud of myself , I took picutes ! Cooking from scratch , I mean from scratch-scratch , no Swanson's , is so enjoyable and YUMMY ! I love it just as much as < PROPMALE > . :) So much better than those crappy Gerber jar foods ! Ick . X ( 
Guess who has his mother's insatiable curiosity , determined disregard for all objects and objections in his way , and ( of course ) gorgeous eyes and smile ? No matter what else , at the end of the day , < PROPMALE > reminds me that life is for more than just living . It's for loving to live . :) 
The sort of full that comes from eating two packs of ramen is not a very pleasant sort of full . It's like I'm still hungry and my stomach is so full it wants to burst . Bugger ! 
I can't keep < PROPMALE > in the family room any more . He nagivated that step into the rest of the house like a pro ! Oh . Em . Gee . He's climbing back down it right now . >.< !!!!!!!! 
< PROPMALE > is eating cheese and cheerios for lunch . YUM ! He LOVES it . :) 
Without your insight , < PROPFIRST > Clarke , I would not have learned to appreciate such works as Pride and Prejudice . Thank you . 
I need to hook up a new gas tank to cook some food . The little inconveniences that help us feel alive and connected to our world ...

Je te garde/Je te pose/A mon cou/Issu à < PROPFEMALE > voix/Inspire moi/Enveloppe-nous/Enlace-moi . 
Getting everything together for being up in Boca tomorrow , then picking up < PROPFIRST > from MIA . Busy , busy , busy ! And soooo tired . 
Found out I'm on financial aid suspension . : X Working to change that ... wrote up my letter of appeal , got a letter from Dr. Levine , and I have yet to fill out the appeal form . Getting things done ! These classes and the Intro to Speech and Com , and I'll have my AA ! WOOOOO ! 
Go Marky , Go Marky , Go , GO ! :) You big crawler-man , you . 
And like-n-ly to like , like . And like-n-ly like , like , to love ... Sure as the stars above I'd really like to love you . :) 
Started the process of in-depth cleaning today . If I get the deep-down stuff first , I can go back over and do a general clean-up beofre Mom comes back home . I think I have a plan ! 
Mom will be home on Sunday . Cleaning house and generally getting ready for her to be here . I'm really excited to have her here with Marky . It means so much to me to be able to share loving < PROPMALE > with his family . :) 
My heart has wings ; I am filled with hope . Tonight , I go to bed happy . 
All right , enough with the sappy stuff . There is a time for everything , and it's time to get serious again . Being an adult is rough ... thankfully , there are some pretty awesome rewards along the way . 
Though I feel sad , I feel a bit more free . Every time , you free me more from the obligation I feel to recognize you . Perhaps you never wanted to be recognized , perhaps this makes you happy ; this isn't about you , it's about Me , it's about < PROPMALE > . 
< PROPMALE > Briand was arrested in a case involving the death of a police officer . It is being said he is responsible for her high-speed crash because she had to swerve to avoid him ... after trying to pass on the right ? I'm going to speak ill of the dead rigth here : that woman was a bitch . She drove recklessly and KILLED HERSELF . But , she's a cop ... so someone needs to cover up her self-inflicted death . This is so wrong . 
Happiness is more than just a goal ; it's a state of being . 
I watched Serenity . 
Off to work . Self-directed day today . 
Everyone keep < PROPFEMALE > in your prayers as she gets better . 
Went to a support group today for the first time . It felt ... slow . Right now I'm on the edge of my seat . I need < PROPFEMALE > . :) 
GRACE is the fact that God already knows every sin & stupid mistake I'll make yet choses to save , bless , & use me . 
9 months ago , a few mintues before Thanksgiving was hailed by the stroke of midnight , Macrus < PROPMALE > Drake was born . This bitty man has gone from an embryonic acrobat to a crawlin-n-cruisin , curiosity-driven , chaos-causin cherub in these short months . Marky , Mama loves you ! 
Sister , you have made me laugh , wiped my tears , hugged me tight , watched me succeed , saw me fail , cheered me on and kept me strong . < PROPMALE > , you are my inspiration . < PROPFEMALE > , you are my tough love . Thank you for your shining examples of strong women willing to fight for happiness , and most especially for your unique support , love , encouragement , and APPROVAL . It means the world to me . 
Just found out < PROPMALE > passed away in a vehicle accident August 18 . RIP . It would be his 31st birthday today . 
I have a new phone , and I realized I have practically no < PROPFIRST > in my new phone . I have no idea where my old phone went to see if I can retrieve those < PROPFIRST > I once had . PM me < PROPFIRST > so I can spread the love of cellphone-stalkerage-at-11-and-I'm-not-feeling-tired-so-I-might-as-well-flip-through-my-phonebook-and-harass-somebody ... people . Yeah , in the plural . Don't act like you don't do it , too . 
Sometimes I just want to copy someone else's status , word for word , and see if they notice . 
I feel nice . :) I want to feel nice when I wake up . Anyone have a wishbone they want to break with me ? 
Class wasn't scheduled today due to the Labor Day weekend . Drove 20 < PROPMALE > to find that out ... the good part is I got to socialize with one of my classmates . It's so nice to get out of the house and talk with people my age . :) 
What the eff , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ! 
The sky is blue and all the trees all green . The sun's as warm as a baked potato ! I think I know exactly what I mean when I say it's a shpadoinkle day . :) 
Let's build a snowman . We'll make him our best friend . We could name him < PROPFIRST > ; < PROPFIRST > will suit well ! 
Love is so very confusing ... 
The blood of a fresh-killed rodent tastes like < PROPFEMALE > wine . The brain of an antelope tastes like cantelope . What a yummy lie ! 
Gabba gabba ! 
Cigarettes and chocolate milk . These are just a couple of my cravings . [ ... ] And then there's those other things which , for several reasons , we won't mention . Everything about ' em is a little bit stranger , a little bit harder , a little bit deadly . 
I am angry . Yup . Hope I get over it soon . 
More important : I found bunches of old pictures while I was cleaning out my room , including my memories box . I want to post them , but this is subject to my ability to concentrate without freaking out and walking away . SERENITY NOW ! :P 
Today is one of those days were I'm just SLAMMED with doing lots of nothing . So busy , but yet nothing seems to be getting done ... :: sighs :: 
No bad dreams last night ! Let's hope this is a new trend . :) 
The sky is blue and all the leaves are green . The sun's as warm as a baked potato ! I think I know precisely what I mean when I say it's a shpadoinkle day . :) 
I need to focus on a bit of discretion . I'm not in college to teach class , but to learn in class . It is rather presumptious of me to act otherwise . 
Gabba , Gabba ! Life is CRAZY . Or perhaps life is just making ME crazy ? 
Today was a day of suckdom that culminated in an evening from hell , sans the visit from < PROPFIRST > . At least God doesn't hate me . Then I would truly be < PROPFIRST > . 
When the world turns upside-down , am I still walking with my feet on the ground ? Perhaps their floating in the air somewhere ... 
Who cares if gravity has reversed its force ? I've got some killer hand-holds . 
Mom is moving up to Pt . St. < PROPFEMALE > today , or Ft . Pierce ? Somewhere . I'm still floating out there . 
Dear Baby Jesus , thank You for ... everything . Just everything . :) 
Nothing is so wonderful as the intimacy that comes inherently with trust . 
“For a baby , innately social , the relationship with his mother is his introduction to humanity , his first human relationship , and the one that sets the tone for all of his future relationships . ”-James Kimmel , P h.D. 
Set a date for our 50's party , picked out the venue , just need to reserve some rooms and send out invites . Let me know who's interested in having a little shindig with < PROPFIRST > and I at the Islander ? 
I just called myself an Electra-sort-of-brother-lover . I have a feeling no one will understand this who has access to that comment , so I'm reposting it here for those who will understand . And perhaps titter a bit . 
I met < PROPFIRST>' mom today . YaYa , you ROCK ! :) 
Listening to Beethoven with Marky . :) I guess I'm just feeling inspired today ? 
Fall Weather = Very Yes Awesome . I'm happy . :) 
I am so in love , and it is absolutely wonderful . Thank you , God , for everything . :) 
Everyday is like a gift . God is wonderful . 
um ... is there some FB status trend going on right now ? Homo ! 
< PROPFIRST > Richert I love you . :) I had a wonderful time today . Do I sound like a broken record yet ? 
How about /this/ for an update ? Commented on < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > ' status about my life having all those that's-so-made-up moments in romance novels happenning in real life . And she noticed . Life is just AWESOME sometimes . Or , perhaps , I just am more apt to notice . Here's to keeping my eyes open to wonderful things . :) 
Broken ? No . Beautiful ? He thinks so . :) 
A toast -- To LIFE ! :) Thank You , God . Amen . :) 
Getting things settled . It's as going as going can go , and I'm happy . 
So ... I < i > must < /i > be truly inspired . I just finished making < PROPFIRST > Richert and myself home-made salsa . He's out fixing the bridge ... for the second time today . Baby , you're most certainly appreciated ! Love you . 
< PROPFIRST > Phillips : They say a true friend can go long periods of time with out speaking and never question the friendship . These types of friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday regardless of how long it has been or how far away they live and don't hold grudges . They understand that life is busy , but know that you will always love them . Re-post if you have at least 1 friend like this . I am privileged to say I DO ! 
I am a line , and you leave me ... bredthless . :: gives a desperate sort of laugh :: 
Being a \pick\ " y sort has never been so fun ! " 
Whether they're big ( • )( • ) or they're small (.) (.) , let's save the ta-tas , let's save them all !! If you're in favor , please repost for Breast Cancer Awareness Month . 
I hate those people who love to tell you money is the root of all that kills . They have never been poor ; they've never had the joy of a welfare Christmas . I know we'll never look back . 
Going to spend the day with my love today , and I'm so looking forward to it ! 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > : Renamed my iPod as ' the titantic ' so when I plug it in it's says ' the titantic is syncing . ' 
Had a not-so-wonderful morning , had a -wow-that-was-awesome evening . : * 
what the eff , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ? i really don't appreciate when fb goes bonkers ... 
Sometimes , I pride myself on the fact that I'm so philosophically open and intelligent in an intellectual-sort of way . Then , I have a conversation with my Dad , and that theory goes out the window . Then I feel really proud to be philosophically open intelligent , just like my Dad is . :) 
likes < PROPFIRST > Richert \ 
Too bad he doesn't have a /real/ fan < PROPFEMALE > . :P 
is ready for a relationship status update . ^_^ 
< PROPMALE > is currently trying to throw his cousin's MSU mini basketball . Go , Marky , go ! 
Love is so easy , and work so undesirable . In a life ruled by opposites of equal proportion , I have so much to gain , and so much to lose . The issue is judging the value of my goals vs . the discomfort of the work involved .... says the lazy woman . God , < PROPMALE > me the strength to do the right thing . 
< PROPFIRST>' aunt is in bad health , and she's not expected to recover . Please keep < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > , her family , and < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > ( his mom ) in your prayers . 
< PROPMALE > is a < PROPMALE > MAN ! Woot . :) His Birthday is coming up on Thanksgiving . Mommy is picking out some special things in Grandad's name for Marky to celebrate . We are very yes excited ! 
Congratulations to < PROPFEMALE > Drake and < PROPFIRST > Chow in their new life together ! :) It's been a long week , and the payoff was AMAZING ! Beautiful wedding , awesome after-party , and lots of time with the family . Watching the youngest < PROPFIRST > ration together is the best of it , it seems ! Wonder what kind of probabilities are at play with the Drake/Chow < PROPFIRST > pools . :)))))) 
I read an article featuring Zurcker ( sp ? ) , the guy who created FB . Now a multi-billionaire , right ? Well , he committed , along with other multi-billionaires across the country , to giving 50%+ of his wealth to charities in his lifetime . If I ever get enough money like that , I have hopes of starting college and school funds to promote classical education . Philanthropy =:) 
Look up at me every now and then and say , ' Tu t-t ut , it looks like rain ' ... I shall sing a little Cloud Song , such as a cloud might sing . \ 
-Whinnie the Pooh 
Work , work , work ... ( and facebook ! ) 
And she was fast , like this ! :: slaps hands together :: 
Thinking of < PROPFIRST > Aykroid , or however one spells his name . I want to watch Grosse Point Blank . I wonder where that old VHS is now ... 
I LOVE getting paid ! Ssh , don't tell < PROPFIRST > , but now he's getting a can of black olives and a SHOWER HEAD THAT WORKS for Christmas ( Old Style ) . 
Thank you @ < PROPFIRST > Stripling for being awesome . :) And , I'm now ready for Old Style Christmas . Can't wait to try out the new shower head . XD 
Note to Self : Don't wrap presents with a one-year-old in the room . It will only lead to MASS DESTRUCTION ! ( ... duh ... ) 
Surprisingly enough , I'm feeling so much love and happiness as this year comes around . Happy New Year , everyone , and let love shine through in your life . Going out to watch the fireworks at the Marriott with < PROPMALE > tonight . Will I see you there ? :) 
Oh , go pee in a hole ! 
Not too busy at work . Hope it picks up for check-out . Helps the day go quicker ! 
I could have sworn the lady checking in just asked if we have voyuers throughout the premise ... Bwahahahaha !!! 
I got a bag full of crabs here . I'm ganna put them in my mouth , oh yes ! 
My baby , oh my baby , I love the way she walk . When the girl get sleepy , I love the way she baby talk . 
Hermaphrodite lady-man-lady , with your sexy bits and your sexy man bits , too . Even you must be into you ! 
Hit his head over the swingset , MMMmmmmHHmmmmm ! 
Christmas Celebration going on at the house on the 7th . :) Christ is Born , Glorify Him ! 
I just spent the last few hours cooking and cooking and cooking ! I'm curious how the cheesecake is going to turn out ? If you want a taste , see you tomorrow . :) 
Christ is Born ! Come over and celebrate with us . I made such AWESOME food you just don't even know . :) 
For every care I'll take , nothin I won't forsake to dwell beside what you got . 
Somewhere , over the rainbow ... < PROPMALE > CUMBERDALE ! Fancy meeting you here . 
< PROPMALE > just climbed up on the couch ALL BY HIMSELF ! 
The more tan < PROPMALE > gets , the more he looks like his father . And I'm telling you , it doesn't take much . 20 mins in the sun today made a BIG difference . 
Did a list of my monthly expenses to get a ballpark figure of what costs wha t--t he most expensive item : BUS FARE ! $56 and some change for 6 rides/wk . FTW ? 
The world must be peopled ! Watching Much Ado About Nothing 1993 . Awesome flick !!! 
Marky is such a big boy eater man ! He is now eating witha spoon ... in one hand , while he picks up food with the other . >.< D'oh! 
If you know such a person as what falls within a category in which you have designated such a person , if you have imagined someone outside the bounds of such strictures , if your imaginings can't travel outside of such strictures -- and thereby your imagined people can't , either -- if you are bound within the contexts of your own understanding , or even if you often exceed your own expectations : I really don't give a shit . 
Isn't this supposed to be a sub-tropic island ? Isn't this supposed to be Florida ? This weather is too too cold ! 
Emily-2 Jury Duty-0 
Flags are flying half-mast today . Memory eternal . 
I am not enamored of empty spaces . They are best ignored , but this comes as a matter of habit . Give a month or two of tomorrows , and I'm sure I will no longer even know what I'm talking about ... 
Marky was so uber awesome today when I got home from work . We had the best evening together . I couldn't have imagined a more perfect baby had I tried ! Mommy loves you . : * 
Dear Lord Baby Jesus in heaven , thank You for giving me the most amazing son EVER ! 
Hate to love and love to hate her , like a broken record player . \ 
-Maroon 5 
< PROPMALE > and I are having the BEST day today ! Swimming and hanging out in the sun and just being relaxed in general . :) 
< PROPFIRST>'s in town . :) 
I wear my sunglasses at noght so I can watch you breathe with < PROPFEMALE > eyes . 
Anybody know about cars for sale around town ? Lookin for a beater that'll get me through the year til next tax season . 
What a gorgeous day ! Out and about with Marky-man , plus lots of outside playtime . :) 
Lord , thank You for creating me with a deep-abiding love for steak and potatoes . Life wouldn't be the same without them . 
My birthday is coming up in two weeks . The plottalating begins ! 
< PROPMALE > came up to me and BIT MY TOES !? 
I miss the Skip-It . 
Just finished making some mauduros ( sp ? ) The verdict ? Slimiest bit of heaven you've ever tasted ! I'll have perfect the texture bit ... 
Hey , can anyone give me a ride this weekend for work ? Will def pay for gas , but I'll have my boy w me . Call me 305-879-9719 
Lesson of Life : People are assholes . My take on that ? Don't be an asshole ! 
First time I've been able to rock my son to sleep for more than 6 mos . There are little , itty-bitty blessings in your baby getting sick and I'm appreciating it . 
Marky has been so sick and crappy feeling at night . I did enjoy rocking him to sleep , but I'm ready for him to be better ! We're going to the doctor's tomorrow ! 
I think she's pretty , but pretty is just one of the things she does that amaze me . 
< PROPMALE > and I had such an awesome day , outside and inside . Thank You , God , for giving me such a special little man . I love you , < PROPMALE > ! 
One lesson of childhood I should never have forgotten : Crayons melt in the sun , and they are Hot and gooey when you acidentally step on them . Oops ... 
Oh my word , it is SO HOT ! 
Marky is practicing walking on his tip-toes ! Too cute . 
If I had a little black box , I'd put the devil in it . I'd take him out and PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH ! and put him right back in it . 
Once again , as predicted , left my broken heart open and you ripped it out . 
Seeing my Mom for my Birthday . :) 
Hutchinson Island beach today & tomorrow . :) 
Just saw a large cat , tan , cross the dirt path at the beach we're at . Cougar ? What wild cats live down here ? ( We're in Ft . Pierce . ) 
Thank you , everyone , for wishing me a happy birthday ! Having a great day outside today , really relaxed and peaceful . I couldn't possibly ask for more ! Thank you , Mom , < PROPFIRST > , and most especially Marky-Man , Baby-Man ! Kisses from Mama . :))) 
Marky Man makes every day a special day . 
Going to church tomorrow for the firdt time in ages ! 
There's nothing better on a hectic day to end it snuggled in bed with a good bool . :) 
There's no better way to end a hectic day than snuggling up in bed with a good book . ** :P 
Eight days a week , I love you ! 
Lots of eye < PROPFEMALE > today . It doesn't hyrt took look . ;) 
Oh , < PROPMALE > Firth , how do I love thee . And P&P . Thank you , cousin < PROPFEMALE > ! You are too awesome ! 
Little girl just walked into the lobby and declared , \Woah ! Fancy ! \"" 
With powerful pen , he depicts so pleasingly those times long past . 
I rarely am on fb these days . Pls call or email me if you want to get in touch , bc it's not going to happen on fb . :)) 
Thank God for good , complete , belly-fiiling , home-cooked meals ! And Spanish wine . :) 
To think that I have been blessed in my life to have such amazing encounters with so brilliant minds as have been created like that of < PROPFIRST > . Memory Enternal . 
There is something truly amazing about living in a place that can be , and has often been , labeled Paradise . This can also be said of < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST>' writing . 
So tired ! About to pass out right here at my desk in front of everyone ... 
You do not believe we are ... Indians !? 
Eldery couple walking around hand-in-hand like newly weds . 
I miss my son . :/ 
I feel so cruddy . :( 
For someone who has made a career of lying , I have no idea how I'm going to convince my boss I was sick today when it's actually true ... 
This pervasive lethargy -- or , more to the point , laziness -- is the baine of my exsistence . The cure ? Facing it head-on with productivity . How unappealing ... :/ 
Bored at work , concocting a list of movies I'd like to own in my lifetime . Suggestions ??? Don't mention Avatar . 
It's amazing how far a pair of heels will go to lift a girl's spirits and make her feel much more appealing . :) 
Let's forget , for a moment , that their are greater and lesser classes of literature to focus on this one fact -- I have read a lot of friggin books ! 
Reading a bit on Capt . < PROPMALE > Collier . What a tragic story !! Wow ... 
Marky Man woke up with a high fever today . Though his fever has subsided with medication , he's so sleepy and cuddly that it still worries me . Poor little man ... 
< PROPMALE > is recovering from his foray against fever today in fitful rest . Of course , this would be after he wrestled off his diaper ... the rest is obvious ... 
Another sick-day for < PROPMALE > . I am so drained ! I think I need this time off almost as much as < PROPMALE > . Tuesday , back to the usual grind . 
Been super exhausted for a while now . However , still spending the night out with my sista ! So worth losing a few hours ' sleep . 
Most fun I've had in a long time !! Thnx < PROPFEMALE > ! 
My favorite FL weather : rain . :) 
Wow , this is so exhilarating !! I LOVE FL rain ! 
What is it with this cold going around ? < PROPMALE > and I have had a hell of a time trying to shake it . 
< PROPMALE > says , \bol-gli ! \ " for \ " birdie\ " . How sweet ! " 
Largopalooza tonight , I think . What do you think , < PROPFIRST > ??? 
I had another dream that < PROPFIRST > asked to meet < PROPMALE > . Somewhere deep in my subconcious is still the hope that < PROPFIRST > will wake up and love < PROPMALE > some day ... 
Had an awesome night with < PROPFIRST > ! Thanks , dude . Battle LA was killer . 
If you wanna be a pirate get up on your feet . You can't be a pirate if you're sitting in your seat . Swing your arms tough , and stand kinda low . 
I find myself yet again applying to college . My degree ? English . I've given in , finally ! Might as well throw in my chips with what I love to do . 
Come pay witness to my embarrassment . From now on , I'll be making company updates on Monday and Thursday on our FB < PROPFEMALE > . Wow ... Fun stuff ... 
I am the ONLY parent who didn't dress her kid in green today ... :: hand , forehead :: 
When in doubt , I'm being facetious ... And most likely mispelling , as well . 
No one plots like < PROPMALE > , takes cheap shots like < PROPMALE > . Tries to persecute harmless crackpots like < PROPMALE > ! So his marriage we soon will be celebrating ... 
:: smiles ironically :: Call me old-fashioned , but I really do perfer my laptop to the iPad . 
Will someone send me a ridiculously long-winded email asking watersports questions ? To my company email . Of course , I can't share that info ... 
Finally visiting the doctor today . It's time to get better !!!! 
She's frsh to death/She'll be the death of you . /Seduction leads to destruction . /She's fresh/But not so clean ... 
Oh my Lord . Had the most disturbing and disgusting phone call . God , preserve me ! 
I'm not sure , but I think I spoke with < PROPFEMALE > Dodd today ? 
Simple Fact of Emily : I'm intellectually promiscuous . I love a fine mind ! 
My sisters are both such wonderful , beautiful women , and I love them both ! I'm so lucky to have them . :) 
My son turns 16 today ! :P little driver-man . 
Oh , yeah . He's with me . And I'm freakin out because I'm just so lucky . :)))) 
My sister us getting married in one hour . Wish I could be there with you , < PROPFEMALE > ! I LOVE YOU ! 
Time is really , truly , a horrible magazine . What a waste . 
It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood , a beautiful day for a neighbor . Would you be mine ? Could you be mine ? Could you be my neighbor ? 
All alone , in my room ; think of you at a rate that's truly alarming . I keep loopin my mem'ries of you in my head ; I pretend that you want me . 
I can't believe/I still recieve/so much affection from your side//If you could give me one more chance/I'd love to turn the tide . 
Think of me/Think of me fondly/When we've said good bye . //Remember me/once in a while/Please promise me you'll try . 
Just saw someone at work who looks just like my very first bf . I think I just fell in love . :) :: Sighs :: 
Quitting smoking SUCKS ! Of course ... I don't like doing the right thing when it's hard . 
Why does every day feel like Monday ? 
She won't kiss and tell ... If I had to guess , I'd say we've got a mess you could sell . 
Actions say nothing without the Motive . 
I need to stop and smell the flowers . I'm going nuts ! 
I've been so negative and depressed lately . Today , I'm feeling much better cause I'm \changin ' my scene . \ " :) "
