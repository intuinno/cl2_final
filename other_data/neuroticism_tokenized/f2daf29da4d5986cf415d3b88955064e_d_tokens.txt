Excited and ready to see what the year 2010 will bring my way . Happy New Year and God Bless =) 

School's finally over ........ for now anyways . On to serving out my community service sentencing and finding a new job . Wish me luck ! 
I wish today hadn't ended . Kasaundra is so awesome and Ocean Shores was absolutely beautiful ! I had some fun in the sun today ! Although getting drenched by ocean waves when you're wearing jeans isn't a good idea :) 
Whatever comes my way I'm facing it head on . 
Hoping for that interview call . I'm tried of not having money 
I was asked what I thought and was honest and open . I just never thought the fact that I'm open-minded would cause me to lose a good friend . I just don't understand why we couldn't agree to disagree . That's not a lot to ask for is it ? 
Still applying for jobs . Staying as positive as I can but I really need that money . Bills don't stop coming :( 
Interview on Thursday ! I'm so excited !! 
Hoping to get hired . I find out on Thursday ! 
I GOT THE JOB !!!!! I'M SO EXCITED !!!! 
A little sore from handling the dogs at the shelter but they're so lovable and sweet :) It's totally worth spending time with them ! If you're local stop by and see them , you'll fall in love ! Plus - new guy and new job - I'm at the top right now ! :D 
Excited to start work next week ! 
He's so amazing it makes me speechless ! Thank you God :) 
Hoping my cold won't last too long :( 
It really does work , crazy ! THE FACEBOOK TRICK : press up , up , down , down , left , right , left , right , B , A , Enter key , then right click then press up and down and magic circles will appear . the only way to get rid of them are to log off or refresh the page ... IT WILL WORK ! put this as your status if it works . 
Hoping to find work very soon . Money can't buy happiness but it sure helps make life easier lol . 
Who knows what'll happen ........... 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas !!! Of course , again , I can't sleep . Then again we're postponing Christmas a couple days , I'm hoping < PROPFEMALE > will understand that =) 
Go to urbandictionary.com, type in your first name , copy and paste this as your status , and put the first entry for your name under comments . 
Got hired on the spot and today was my first day !! Got tipped $10 for helping with a party and was told that I have supervisor potential !! 
Work was crazy busy today ! 16 parties with at least 12+ kids plus all the regular walk ins . Had to clean up a huge mess in the play structure and then got lost and couldn't find my way out - gotta love huge indoor play equipment and dirty children lol ! 
Had the most fun last night ! Friends , family , drinks and \baking\ " cakes lol . It's awesome being 21 ! Thanks for an awesome 21st you guys =D " 
Thank you for all the birthday wishes everyone , it was a very fun and eventful day . I enjoyed every minute =) 
Happy to be out of the hospital as of yesterday but still feeling sick =( my mom's such a great caregiver though . I'm blessed to have her =) 
New photos are up . Check them out =) 
RIP < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > \Whatcha talkin bout Willis ? \"" 
Had so much fun this weekend ! < PROPMALE > out with the bf and < PROPMALE > at < PROPFIRST>'s and then swimming at the pool , Sunday was lake swimming and then wrestling match with little Desi in the front yard with the sprinkler lol . He's a tough kid just like his daddy =) I'm sunburned , sore and bruised but it was completely worth it ! 
Just got back from my 1st whole day trip in Forks with < PROPFEMALE > =) Got exciting pics and saw beautiful scenes at the La Push beach . It definitely won't be my last trip there =) 
Life is a highway . If you don't like the way you're headed , take a turn and change the direction . Believe in impossibilities and anything can happen , just think outside the box . When life gives you lemons , make grape juice =) 
Wondering ...... are you missing and thinking of me as much as I miss and think about you ? =( 
It's about time I move towards the goals I lost a while ago . I took my first steps this week . I only hope I have enough faith in myself to keep going and not screw up , like I have . I want to make mom proud ....... and know that dad is too . I'll do it mom and daddy , I will . 
Aaron : Forget ADD , you have ADOS - attention deficit oh shiny\ 
Me : ( didn't hear him ) Wow < PROPFEMALE>'s board is so colorful ! When was that done ? \ 
Aaron : ( Laughs and shakes head ) My point exactly 
Yes !!! Can't wait to start driving my own car . Back on the road tomorrow everyone !! =D 
God loves throwing curve balls and rocks into my path just to see me jump . I think He's amused when I trip and yell at the rocks . Happy and satisfied though when I jump and land , love , laugh and keep moving forward . Learnin my lesson through it all . Thank you Big Man , especially for your sense of humor =) 
People seem to forget that there's always a little truth behind every lie , every just kidding , and every I don't care . 
Trying to forget what you did is like trying to remember someone you never met - impossible . 
~ Life isn't about waiting for the storm to pass , it's about getting out there and dancing in the rain . So I can either curse because roses have thorns or smile big because thorns have roses ~ 
You told me what I really want I'll never get because I settle for the easy reach . I became defensive and mad at you ............... because you're right =( 
Realizing it might be a risk but I'm excited to take it ! Many will be very surprised but my gut's telling me it's the right path =D 
I want the one who sees my wall , fights and break through , the one who knows that sometimes I smile just to keep the tears from falling . 
Oh the weather outside is frightful ...... but the fire is so delightful ..... and since we've got no place to go ...... Wait , I have work .... crap ! 
When you hand out a knife it's because you fully trust the person who holds it . So should you feel upset and pain if they stab your back or completely stupid for thinking you could ever trust them in the first place =( 
Had some interesting parties today as a host but I'd say it was a pretty good day for Saturday =) Better if I wasn't sick though . 
Only God and a bit of < PROPFEMALE > magic can give me what I really want for Christmas 
So excited !!!! =D 
Such a better day than yesterday . Army Christmas party hosted by yours truly and my awesome p.i.c < PROPFIRST > Harper . Love ya chica =D We even got our pics taken with < PROPFEMALE > ! I never knew he was a military sgt though , how cool ! Lol . 
What a great Christmas party , I love my safari peeps =) 
2 weeks ! Nervous and excited , I hope that's a good thing =) 
I miss having the companionship that a dog gives and the entertainment that a cat brings but Twitch , < PROPMALE > and McNutty fill part of it . As long as they get their walnuts they could probably entertain me for hours lol 
[ Poke ] me if you ever had a crush on me . \ 
[ Like ] this status if im a good friend . \ 
[ Message ] me if you ever wanted a relationship . \ 
[ Comment ] on this if we had any great memories . \ 
If you feel brave , Copy this and post it on your status 
God granted my wishes this year , I'm very , very blessed . Maybe this is both of them saying Hey we know you messed up pretty bad this year but deep down you have a good heart . I wish a < PROPFEMALE > Christmas to everyone . Being surrounded by friends and family truly makes a warm Christmas =) 
Less than 48 hours ...... wow =D 
Just got back home , what a long day ! 
What you did hurt more mentally than it ever would physically 
Scars are permanent , I know you heard me . What hurts is that you didn't listen . 
Too much ...... I need a strong shoulder to cry on because I'm so close to breaking 
\I'm fine . \ " My biggest lie . Until I want to talk accept it as the truth because I'll say it until it is . " 
I will now forgive but never forget . I will love but trust very few . And only once I've seen your actions will I ever believe your words . 
Spent the day in Portland to see family , meeting 7 yr old < PROPMALE > for the 1st time and seeing 9 yr old < PROPFEMALE > since she was 1 . You both reminded and showed me innocence ( through tickles ) , faith in life ( through laughs ) , strength ( through wrestling ) , and < PROPFEMALE > ( through chess ) , all things I lost faith in . < PROPFEMALE > - your smile made me smile and < PROPMALE > - your hugs could melt a heart of ice =) Never change lil tigers . 
Couldn't ask for better best friends , my trust and faith isn't completely gone . I love you guys =) 
God works in mysterious ways ...... 
Had dinner with my p.i.c .... and then got lost picking up my bro from Ozzy concert ...... and then drove around Tacoma , < PROPMALE > , and Federal Way trying to find the freeway back home ......... and then .......... sweet ..... dude !!! Lol
