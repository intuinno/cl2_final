< PROPFEMALE > Markey is one of the greatest ladies I have ever had the privilege of knowing . She had a great laugh that was so infectious-you couldn't resist it ! I will miss her grin , she always wore it-it lit up her whole face . But the best part of < PROPFEMALE > was her enormous capacity for love , she had the biggest heart of anyone I know . I loved her dearly and will miss her so much . The world is a dimmer place now . 

< PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone ! May the New Year see your fondest wishes and dreams fulfilled . May it be happy , healthy and be filled with the people that you love , that love you and bring you happiness . Remember to hug your family and friends and smile at strangers-you never know who may need that little lift the most .

heading out to begin round one of me vs . the snow . come on people , chant with me , I HATE SNOW !... I HATE SNOW !... I HATE SNOW ! 
Alas , the snow has defeated me .... just kiddin ! i've been out every hour on the hour shovelin my lil heart out ! it's coming down so fast i cannot believe it ! i'm sure i'll be weeping over a sore back/shoulders tomorrow , but it'll be worth it when i'm not out there digging out 2 feet worth of this nasty crap ! 
it looks like i woke up and somehow my home has warped to the yukon ! 
going out with the little man to dig a fort in the snow ! doesn't that sound like way more fun than shoveling ? hopefully it won't cave in on me ! 
is it me or does it look like its gonna snow today ? its all cloudy and icky lookin . i swear if it snows again today i'm crawling under my bed and not coming out again until may ! except for periodic trips to see < PROPFIRST > ! 
does anyone know where the flea market in quakertown is ? 
got my feet up , wine in hand , movie on the box , not shoveling a damn flake , and not moving till tomorrow ! any takers ? 
watching the best worst movie ! mega shark vs . giant octopus ! thanks to my brother for the recommend . FANTASTIC ! 
Maybe , just once , someone will call me ' Ma'am ' without adding , ' You're making a scene . '

nothing is more pride inducing or frustrating than wat < PROPFEMALE > g your child put their head up and < PROPFEMALE > out to deal with a problem on their own . especially when all you want to do is scoop them up , cuddle them close and then kill the people that made them hurt in the first place . i'm not sure what's more difficult : achieving adult hood or helping your kids get there . i feel a poll on ... any takers ? 
aaahhhhh , the weekend is here !

sometimes you just gotta say , what the f**k 
everyone needs to find the person that is their true north-the one thats their safe harbor . when the winds blow to send them in the wrong direction . everyone should know this kind of love , comfort and contentment . knowing that together you can keep the boat yar , when < PROPFEMALE > seas come .

YUMMMMMM 
<--- smiling .... it's a beautiful day ! 
iti's not the blows we are dealt , but the ones we survive that matter . 
<--- wants to climb into bed , pull the covers over my head and stay there for , oh , i dont know , maybe a month or so . sigh . i want a day where there is no drama , nothing happens that makes my heart stop for a minute , and is uneventful . i just know days like that exist somewhere .

can't wait ! going to spend the day with my nephew . I cannot think of a better way to start my weekend !!! <3 i love my nephews and niece ! don't get to spend enough time with them-so this is a real gift . 
trying to figure out where i went wrong . especially sucks on such a beautiful day like this . WTF 
yesterday was our 20th anniversary ! most people bet we'd never make a year , let alone 20 , so it is with no small measure of pride that we celebrated our day ! so few people have the pleasure/honor of still liking and loving each other & having the passion that tj and i enjoy ! so to my dearest friend & lover : thank you for sharing your life with me ! always and all ways yours !
