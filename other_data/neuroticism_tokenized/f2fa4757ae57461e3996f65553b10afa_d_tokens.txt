Glad its the last day of the work week :) 

What to do with today ... 
Too much I want to do and so little time . 
Nothing like a frantic day to end the week . Training a co-worker , fixing the damn Kuper , and getting lift drivers ! Then getting pulled over at lunch and getting a $179 citation . 
Cedar Point is just one week away ! 
has finally got a camera ! 
had a great time at the bars this weekend ! 
wasn't able to get to friday off :( 
I am finally getting trained to be a full-time lift driver ! lol I have always wanted that postion ! 
Had a good time at Rockfest 2010 ! 
<3 Leinenkugels beer :) 
Yay insomnia . 
Worst month of my life . Everyday I tell myself , tomorrow everything will be , but tomorrow hasn't come ... 
Its good to have money again ! 
The week is half way over ! 
What a long and boring night .
