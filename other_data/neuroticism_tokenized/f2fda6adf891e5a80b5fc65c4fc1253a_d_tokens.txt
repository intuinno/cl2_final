urbandictionary.com ... < PROPMALE > -The coolest guy in the world , but can be an asshole from time to time and is carefree when it comes to just about anything . Basically he just doesn't give a shit ... A < PROPMALE > or Nick ... enjoys chonga and the finer things in life ... He is a drifter and a daydream believer ... some might speculate that the < PROPMALE > is a conceited , hopeless romantic , and is most likely a loner . 
So , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is getting his 8th divorce , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > is possibly getting married for a 9th time , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > and Tiger Woods are screwing EVERYTHING , yet the idea of same-sex marriage is what is going to destroy the institution of marriage ??

Had a great time hiking today and going to Gays Days at Oktoberfest up at Snowbird . So much fun and so many Gays . Great Day ! 
One of every 10 people are born gay . That means 1 of every 10 people is instantly put down , given bad labels , left alone , put in a minority , and so much else all for something they didn't ask for . Many gay teens are going to suicide as a way of escaping . If you want to tell them life will get better , and you respect and love them for who they are , copy and paste this . 
\If\ 
needs to tell you all something you might no know about me ... I'm Gay !!! Happy National Coming Out Day everybody . 
I'm in love and it's the real deal ... it's ... like keep the baby type of love . 
Today we will wear purple in remembrance of the 6 young gay men who committed suicide in recent weeks/months due to homophobic abuse in their homes and at their schools . Purple represents spirit on the LGBTQ flag ! Please know that times will get better , and you will meet people who will love and respect you for who you are , no matter ... what your sexuality 
Everyone keeps telling me to Vote ..... I didn't think American Idol was on yet . 
VEGAS BABY !!! 
Happy Veterans Day ! Thank you to all of those who served and continue to fight for our freedom ! 
Why was there so many Gays out this weekend ?... oh that's right . Disney on ice is in town . 
Thanks for all the Birthday Wishes .... I have so many fans ! 
You know , if someone told or shown the Grinch #itgetsbetter when he was a kid , I'm sure he would have never stolen Christmas . #JustSaying 
PLEASE Put this on your status if you know someone ( or are related to someone ) who has been eaten by dragons . Dragons are nearly unstoppable and , in case you didn't know , they can also breathe fire . 93% of people won't copy and paste this because they have already been eaten by dragons . 6% of people are sitting in the shower armed with fire extinguishers & the remaining 1% are awesome and will repost this . 
For christmas I'm getting my sister a large piece of coal in a box labeled Build your own diamond ... ( Time not included ) . 
If U think about it , < PROPFEMALE > is kind of a hipster . Beard , old clothes , only goes 2 the mall once a year , keeps a list if who's cool & who's not . 
Life , as we know ... was much simpler back when Apple and Blackberry were just fruit . S&M were sizes & you never had to press 1 for english ! 
Facebook is for the people you know . Twitter is for the people you wish you knew . and Myspace is for the people you wish you NEVER met . 
To all men and women of goodwill , to all people who know how love each other regardless of sexual orientation , race , skin colour , nationalities or social background & even those who don't , in hope that you soon will , Happy Holiday's to you !!! 
OMG < PROPFIRST > Guido turns 30 in 15 days .... I think the world might end . 
Christmas is all down and put away ... now time for a bottle of wine to end my night and weekend .
