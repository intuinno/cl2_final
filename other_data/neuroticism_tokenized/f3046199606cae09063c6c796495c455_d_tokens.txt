i cant believe im graduating ! getting nervous ... 

DONE WITH HIGH SCHOOL FOREVER !!! 
graduation's over and looking forward to college ! 
Why do my thoughts and emotions shut down when I need to think ? Damn faulty wiring I suppose ... 
got nerves ? 
Eat a lemon , it puts life into perspective . 
Learning a new language ... or trying to anyways . ^_^ I'm finding myself to be a less than adequate teacher . Makes me appreciate the teachers who have actually been able to shove the knowledge I have into my brain . Thanks ! ^_^ 
Thanks guys ^_^ 
Thanks for all the birthday wishes . You made my birthday that much better . ^_^ 
Wondering about the state of my life and the things that are happening . Are people the way they say they are or are they pretending to get something they want ? Is my sanity firmly attached to reality or am I pretending to myself ? Dammit all to hell for not being clear to my addled brain ! ( Insert crazed grin here ) 
If you say you're going to do something , do it . Otherwise , keep your mouth shut .
