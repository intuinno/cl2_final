Lacking of closure ... No clue why , it just seems like that's the right thing to say . 

I've had an epiphany and I'm f***ing ecstatic bout it ! 
Life just keeps getting better and better ... Except for the fact that my best friend < PROPMALE > is moving to New Hampshire ... Otherwise , I like where I'm heading . 
I'm finally 16 ; too bad I can't get my license until the 23rd of December though ... How's life going for all of you people out there ? 
The world is an ever changing place and I love it all . Life is giving me a buzz and nothing can take it from me . 
Busy being reminded how cool Finland is by listening to Rajaton's song Butterfly ... 
Practicing for this season's upcoming audition for the Tacoma Youth Symphony ... 
Wondering why all I can seem to do is lie to myself ... 
Feeling as studly as ever . 
When was the last time I ever posted anything here ...? Well , I have no clue what else to say in my status update ... Fuchsjahr indeed ... 
Contacting all people planning on attending our after high school all summer vacation ... ( I'll get a message out to < PROPMALE > since he still doesn't have a Facebook ... ) 
Hey , the Puyallup Fair is coming up soon isn't it ? So , who's all going with me this year ? 
School started , kinda sorta , yet it feels like perpetual Saturday to me ... Life's great , so live it up ! 
Supernatural starts its 5th and , more than likely , last season next Thursday at 9/8 Central/Pacific ... Yay for the only TV show I follow/actually , watch at the moment . o (^_^) o 
o (^_^) o What now !? 
When was the last time I updated this ? Hey guys , college courses start on Monday for me , so that means one weekend left of summer . =D 
Umm , I'll be back to update this later ... yeah ... 
Dang , 38 friends !? I guess I'm going to have to start clearing out my friends list ... ( jk ) o (^_^) o 
Can't stop thinking of/listening to The Planets by Gustav Holst ... ( I wish we could perform this piece again ... it was amazing . ) 
KJAQ Seattle all the way ! ( < PROPFIRST > Fm [ 96.5 ] rocks ) 
Just heard that NASA's bombing the < PROPFEMALE > this Friday ( October 9 , 2009 ) at 4:30 PMT . Anyone can watch it from Earth , as long as you have a 10-12 inch telescpoe or better . 
We're 2 hours and 10 minutes away from the lunar bombing ... Cool , huh ? On a side note : Well , anyone out there who missed Supernatural tonight , you missed a great episode ; < PROPFIRST > beheaded < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > with an iron axe ! ^_^ 
Umm , I'm finding Facebook to be pretty boring now ... So what's up world ? Life treating everyone good out there ? ( and if not ... well ... umm , sucks for you ... I think ) Opening weekend this weekend though , so that means time to go hunting , though I'm not really that psyched ' bout it this year ... >_< 
The Islander - Nightwish 
Mr. Brightside - The Killers Yep , it's that time of the year again . ^_^ 
Umm , anyone there ...? Hello ...? 
Ugh , we're failing as a soccer team as of late ... ( What happened ...? ) 
press up , up , down , down , left , right , left , right , B , A , Enter key , then right click . After a few seconds press up and down and magic circles will appear . I didn't think it would work ! Put this as your status if it works . after you follow all the steps scroll up or down ... then the circles will appear . The only way to get rid of them are to log off or refresh the < PROPFEMALE >

Actually ... < PROPMALE>'s Possessed Hair/It's What We're All About ---> Sum 41 ( That a normal enough song title for you < PROPFEMALE >?) 
Is it just me , or does < PROPFIRST>'s Mudkip drawing seem immature ? ( Not to mention the fact that it isn't even funny ... ) 
We Belong ---> < PROPFIRST > Benatar ... ( Holy crap ! 20% of my friends are online ...! What do I do ? ) 
Third Eye Blind --> Jumper ( Currently playing on < PROPFIRST > Fm , Seattle ... currently as in , when I posted this ... ) 
The time between worlds theoretically surrounds the space between our conscious identity . 
Last Summer ---> Lostprophets back when they were 10x's better ... ( Rooftops is okay but doesn't compare to this . ) 
Hey < PROPMALE > , you're flying out this summer and we're going to go see Sum 41 in concert when they come out with their new album . 
Update ... August 15th at the < PROPFIRST > Ampitheater and August 18th at the Washington Country Fairgrounds ... ( 15th in Washington 18th in Portland , Oregon ) 
Well , looks like all that's left to do today is finish up my school work with my online POLS & 203 class ( International Relations ) . 
Pieces ---> Sum 41 ( or Better Off On My Own ... according to PreGame Lobby ) 
Why are people randomly naming colors today ? >_< 
The Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate < PROPFEMALE > ---> Lemon Demon 
I feel the need to be extremely politically incorrect sometime in the upcoming week ... if it offends you , well , sorry , but oh well . %_% 
%_% The deed is done and the urge has passed . ^_^ 
Time for bed suckers ! o(F_T)o 
URGENT : The world is suffering from a peanut butter shortage ! Joker , what shall we do ! 
Anyone up for an orchestral concert at the Rialto theater in Tacoma on the 6th of March ? I believe the tickets are $7.00 at the door ... 
This is copied from my friend Pope Smotage The European Commission has just announced an agreement whereby English will be the official language of the European Union rather than < PROPMALE > , which was the other possibility . As part of the negotiations , the British Government conceded that English ... spelling had some room for improvement and has accepted a 5- year phase-in plan that would become known as ' Euro-English ' . 
Offline --> No clue when I'll be back on . 
I need some recent pictures ... time to go on vacation to get some pictures . ^_^ 
I'm really tired of making jokes , ugh , so what's up world ? 
^{} <=> {}^ 
Ungh , I guess I'll make a comment on the San < PROPMALE > trip tomorrow ... I'm too tired right now . 
Still not feeling like posting about my vacation ... ( maybe I have writers ' block ... >_>) 
Hmm ... < PROPMALE > , we need to go raid Fort Knoxx soon . 
Ah nostalgic thoughts , why do you plague me so ... 
Down by the water I'll be killing you in my dreams ... 
Ungh ... w/e , I don't feel like posting what I was going to post atm ... 
Satisfy --> Vedera 
And so , it begins ... 
Extending oneself to < PROPMALE > friendships across all regions of the state , country , world , etc . can result in some interesting < PROPMALE > meetings and the acquisition of many new aquaintances and quite a few good friends . Thank God for the grand estate we live in . 
Time for the fragments of rational and reason to fall out of the cracks in my mind , therefore forming a new picture and vision for the sake of artistic embodiment . 
Silence ... \ 
The solitary sound of your own breathing is all that pesters your ears . The life you were never allowed to experience is right in front of you waiting to be explored ... \ 
Is this world real ...? Is the existence of a world inside a coma but a dream or another reality ? 
One of the things I've always found myself fascinated with is the endless amount of possibilities associated with the creation of a new world and a new life through the manipulation of a coma ... \ 
Now , more than ever I wish I were lucky/or perhaps unlucky enough to wake inside the confines of a coma induced reality at the moment . 
My people ... \ 
\ 
Sons and daughters of Montana , for many years we have been a broken \ 
state . Shunned , oppressed , and conquered by those who sought to \ 
escape ... Three years ago I asked for time , and that time was granted by\ 
you ... you , the strength in my arms , the holder of my dreams . 
Forgot how amazing the Godfather was ... phew , what a great cinematic < PROPFEMALE > . 
I can't guarentee I will have all the answers ... but it is my turn now ... Like my status and I will tell you what I like , dislike , first impression , and a confession about you 
I didn't like that last status , so here's a piece of advice/poetic inspiration ; w/e . \ 
Your\ 
dreams are the true essence of your being . The embodiment of your soul\ 
and your rational mind . Everything your subconscious wants to bring to\ 
the surface is floating on the top of the water in your dreams . \ 
Listen to them and follow them . Believe in them ; therein lies the path of focused perception and the < PROPMALE > of foresight ... 
What colors will you post back to me ? \ 
( I will kill you if you do something retarded or act like a fag ... )\ 
Pink = i\ 
like you . \ 
Purple = i would date you . \ 
Blue = i did love you . \ 
Red = i do \ 
love you . \ 
Orange = i like talking to you . \ 
White = i really care about \ 
you . \ 
Silver = we tight . \ 
Green = you're sexy . \ 
Black = I hate you . \ 
Grey = \ 
you're pretty . 
Well , I personally cannot wait from Entry #27 regarding the Slenderman occurrences . \ 
* I do not believe or endorse the belief the toulpas do or do not exist . \ 
On a side note I'd just like to say that if the < PROPMALE > of concentration can lead to the creation and existence of toulpas then would not that same philosophy hold true for that of a dream induced state of mind ? 
Getting myself back into the habbit of living life by the moment ( basically being present at home ) . The only problem with this is I leave for Central on Sunday , haha . \ 
On a side note : Once again life is grand ; this should go w/o say though . Anyone want to hit me up for a Sum 41 concert over at the Gorge Amphitheater on August 14th ? 
Great to be back at home ; M2AF tomorrow the bbq is at 7 pm roughly ( that's when we're eating dinner ) but you're welcome to come over whenever you want to tomorrow ( this is for those who I invited already ) . \ 
The Planets : Movement IV Jupiter ---> Gustav Holst 
At least one more , if not the final , an ode to the one who lingers inside the presence of the shadows of my mind . The one in control of the realms of my subconscious ; holding tight to a state of mind . This one mindset I've tried to banish but prevailing through the darkness ' hold she is my light . \ 
Trying to shed this aspect of my being has never been fully successful before ... Where shall I go from here ? 
Creepin ' on facebook ! XD 
Great day to be living , eh . Today's song : Thanks for Nothing --> Sum 41 
Definitely a welcomed change in venue over the last few days ( thank you God for the overcast and cooler temperature inside and out ) . \ 
Today's song : < PROPFEMALE > --> < PROPMALE > Collins ( i.e. This is the world we live in ; these are the hands we're given . ) 
Oh what to do with this new inspiration ... \ 
Song of the day : The Dead Heart --> Midnight Oil 
Thousands of < PROPFEMALE > bubbles are sprouting from this one big bubble . <-- ( observation made by me ... ) 
Ow that hurt ... 0 . o my dang Ding < PROPFIRST > was frozen solid ! 
\The iron lung collapsed from the pressure and the swelling ; I can hardly breathe at all ! \ " <--- runner-up song to Mr. Brightside ( The Killers ) imho " 
Hmm , sweet I made it into TYS this year . Looks like this will be an amazing final chapter to my experiences involving the Tacoma Youth Symphony . ^_^ Hope to see everyone from TYAO ( last year ) in TYS this year . 
What to do today ... hmm ...? 
Supernatural season 6 premiere in two weeks . 0 . o 
To the fair ? This upcoming week ? Thursday or something ? Anyone ? Hello ...? 
Oh the music one listens to at 4am in the morning ... thank God for songs like A Neverending Dream --> Cascada 
What's up with everyone getting hacked on facebook nowadays ? 
Anyone\ 
know any credible sources on the phenomenon of Astral Projection ? All I\ 
can tell from researching the subject matter is that everyone who \ 
claims to possess the ability to perform this task basically just recites\ 
the fact that they are lucid dreaming ... not projecting themselves onto\ 
an astral plane ... =P 
I wonder if it would possible to trick your own mind into creating a tulpa that only \haunts\ " yourself . ( as in I created it so I'm the only one who sees it/it comes to me in my dreams ... )\ 
Into the \ 
cracks of my mind I release the essence of my being . For in the shadows \ 
formed inside this insane realm lie the answers to eternal conscious \ 
questions ... Random tidbits with no coherent thought behind them ? \ 
And We Danced --> Hooters 
PUT THIS AS YOURSTATUS AND SEE WHAT PEOPLE RATE YOU : 1 : Crazy . 2:I'd kiss you . 3 : Attractive . 4 : wieird . 5 : i miss you . 6 : bestfriends . 7 : pretty . 8 : Smart . 9 : dumb . 10 : i so wanna date you . 11 : random . 12 : hot . 13 : funny . 14 : annoying . 15 : amazing . 16 : tough . 17 : Cute . ... 18 : Beautiful . 19 : Nerd 10 : badass 11 : Halfwayz Badass 12 : krazy ...... 13 : other ... 
Wish I could shrink down to a microscopic size , enter my own body , and then proceed to unleash hell upon the sickness that is infecting my sinus cavities ... I would wage total war and destroy this sicknesses so thoroughly that it would cease to exist in this reality ! 
Just a thought :\ 
Nostalgia has somehow crept up upon me and is now fighting for my sanity ( or dementia ...? ) . Fantasia ( 1940 ) , the original Land Before Time , three year old ramblings , antics and shenanigans , etc . where did all these go ? Where have they been hiding all of this time . Oh to be younger again ... to relive those first experiences ... all first experiences . 
How would one go about self inducing a comatose state ? ( not for me , just to help spur my ideas on how to self induce a coma in my novel ) ... 
The dreamers are coming for you ... 
Who is writing on my wall , hmm ? \ 
In the realm of the dreamer time has no meaning ... does this mean length and distance have no meaning too because length is but an abstract of time . 
Power outage at my house . So , right about now retreating into a comatose world sounds like a pretty cool idea ; sadly , still an idea ... 
No school tomorrow either ... full week minus two class periods ( I had two classes on Monday before school closed ); awesome . 
\And we danced 
If you saw me in 7 years with a wedding ring , who would you think i was married to ? Repost this and see what you get . 
Oh coma where in time are you hiding ? Shall I ever get to witness your < PROPFEMALE > and majesty ? I wish for you not yet would embrace you with open arms and spirit if put in a position placing you in my life ... 
If a world is created when locked inside your own mind through the effects of a coma ; how real is it ? When you finally awake does everyone/thing cease to exist in that world or does that universe live on without you ? 
Thinking about continuing work on my novel today . \ 
Which reality is actually carved out of the bedrock of existence and which one is but a mere thought from the depths of the dreamer's mind . The one constituting our reality or the one trapped inside a coma from the reality of this standpoint ? One views the other as but a dream while the other sees not a dream , but a foreign existence beyond the void between planes . 
Standing alone in a corner of reality . Is there no one here to keep my senses occupied , to confirm my existence , to help me see again ? The essence of being is lost when everything and anything merges to form anew . All is possible yet thousands of things shall meet restrictions in the mind's eye , a place where there are none . \ 
When this one awakens from his slumber billions others will surely perish . 
In the moments between thought lies a darkness consistent with that of the void . The void lies beyond all that relates to time and the realities it surrounds . Without this void the phenomenon of a reality taking shape inside another would be impossible at best . For multiple dreamers can exist at one time ; each dreaming of the other . \ 
Which is real ? 
Convoluted Daemons have been exorcised ... in the semi-finals too . 
Malls are boring and metropolitan markets can be interesting sometimes but are ultimately quite boring ... Though when you and your best friend are getting chased through a gigantic spralling city/mall/metropolitan market by some random mafia hitman while you in turn are trying to bust a comrade out of captivity somewhere in the complex things start to get interesting . \ 
Oh the wonders of dreaming . 
Circular rotational occurences and singlular universes containing a multitude of separate realities . With everything interconnected all are dependent on each other ; if one becomes extinguished then all subsequent universes cease to exist . All except for the prime universe holding the entire coalition together . \ 
Dirty Little Secret - Nightcore ( originally by : American Rejects ) 
\Oh to relive the burdens of the past . To rewrite everything that has shaped me up until this moment ... Why do it ? Not for reasons of regret but rather as a way to experience everything anew with the knowledge of what happened last time . The < PROPMALE > to experience a new reality with no connection to this present one . \ " - < PROPFIRST > Twyn " 
Watching Mulan with my sister . Kickass disney movies ftw ! 
Screaming Bloody Murder : ( single ) --> Out as of 25 minutes ago . \ 
Screaming Bloody Murder : ( album ) --> Out March 29 , 2011 ... almost there . 
Oh , what to do with the ever changing course of it all . Let's all die and escape the monstrosity that is time . <-- ( or we could continue on of course ... I don't see why we wouldn't just do that)\ 
The present is definitely a great time at the moment ( the present is the only time the present is awesome ? ) . Listening to Screaming Bloody Murder atm ... absolutely awesome . Wanna skip on time with me ( no death ... =/ ) ? 
What have we done ? We as a species have created an ouroboros named Time . The future is always decreasing in size and will not stop until Judgment Day and Ragnarok come to be . The present is the enabler of the past , for as sparks in the wind it constantly captures the essence of the future in order to feed itself to the ever hungering mass that is the past . \ 
Only death can separate one from time ... 
Alas the wind continues to blow . 
We found < PROPMALE > Apple ! 
If one falls into the void will his mind remain intact or fragmented by the harsh reality of an open abyss devoid of everything yet filled with everything that is and shall ever be once he returns ? 
Absolutely nothing to do at this hour ... \ 
No classes for me tomorrow , no one to chat with , not in the least bit tired , and hungrier than I should be seeing as my mom makes excellent cod ... What a great time for sleep procrastination to take a hold of my life . 
Just now starting to stiffen up from lifting weights with < PROPFIRST > Odd on Thursday ... hopefully my muscles straighten themselves out by tomorrow at the latest otherwise life is going to suck for a short while . \ 
On a side note :\ 
Listen to the wind ... admit to yourself the true reality of the unmentionable horrors you've encountered in the ... depth of night . In the realm of shadows . 
Anyone curious as to the nature of deer camp should acquaint themselves with the movie Escanaba in da Moonlight . 
Slenderman and totheark are closing in on our favorite paranoid amnesic camerman . 
The Shadow Guard ; those of the Northern Faction . Leechers , Sifters , Puppeteers and Scryers ... the Realignment linked them in darkness and gave dominion of the North to the Wyhrland . \ 
Troops native to Ijun , Nordwyhr , Latwyhr and Mogstwyhr have overrun the perimeter separating Crux from the outside plane , Vandaria . The < PROPFEMALE > of Night is advancing and the Southern Alliance is stuck at a cross roads . 
Hoping math class is nixxed today like yesterday ... however , it is not . \ 
Particle are a keystone for our understanding and access of the void . religiously there is no limbo , yet the creation of one as a manifestation of the mind may be conceivable ... \ 
Into the void we thow ourselves . ever dreaming ... 
Does one relive an entire lifetime in the space of their final dreams ? Those dreams one dreams before they depart this world ... dreams one never wakes up from . Dreams in which time has no meaning whatsoever . 
Reality of fiction ; am I out of my mind ? 
Compare/contrast paper finished/submitted ; moving on to my journal entry for Eng&112 ... all done after that . 
Enjoying a hot cup of tea , some grand ole ' corn chowder , and a chicken sandwhich ... and Live and Let Die was just on the radio to boot . Great day ; a grand estate indeed . 
Watch me put my heart in a blender ; watch it spin around to a beautiful oblivion ... 
Half my mind is connecting too many random occurrences together to construct a blind reality while the other half wars on to prevail against fate . Starting to sound like the Pluto Project really ... \ 
Friday I'm in Love <- The Cure 
Or we could all just listen to Krafty by New Order ... 
Still listening to Krafty ( by New Order ) ... anyone else out here in limbo ; disconnected to the rest of the world ? 
96.5 ( < PROPFIRST > fm/KJAQ ) is pure gold . Always have to get my daily 2 hour dose between classes . 
I've found the ending to my novel . Time to fix up some of the plot holes and start writing again . 
To everyone just returning from their jaunts ; watch for the wind to notice her subtle changes in the times to come ... 
If time is perceived through our perceptions ; therefore , a person living a life of 128 years only experiences 7 periods in his/her life equal in length to the time it takes him/her to age from 1-2 years ( only 5 of which can be remembered consciously ) , then ..? \ 
The question posed is this : Would an immortal see the sun streaking across the sky as what used to be days become mere seconds through his/her perception ? 
A half rational mind is under my possession and ... control ? Misconceptions and misunderstandings rule over rational thought . 
Found my wild < PROPFEMALE > ... I fell into a ring of fire . 
Let's lie down and sleep for all eternity . 
To meet someone in your dreams ( meaning you created him/her ) . Bringing life to that someone's existence to pass the test of time and waste away the day while living the night . Illusion or reality ; at which point does one become the other ? 
A month and a week away the quarter will be over , we'll have just started our final concert set of the year for youth symphony and < PROPFIRST > sparrow returns ! Xd 
Tentative Spring Schedule :\ 
10:00 - 10:50 AM --> Math&254-Calculus IV ( Daily)\ 
12:00 - 12:50 PM --> < PROPMALE > 210-Comparative Religion ( Daily)\ 
01:00 - 02:30 PM --> Geol 106-Dinosaurs ( MWF ) XD\ 
Arranged ----------> Engl 127-Writing : Social Sciences ( Online ) 
Tentative Schedule --> Confirmed Schedule 
Oh and btw , before I load it into short term memory , anyone want a copy of the new Sum 41 album ? It won't be out until March 29th , but hey , that's not too far away . 
Entering hour number 6 of < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > -> Shiny toy Guns on loop ... Curse you < PROPFIRST > Myren ! 
Still listening to Shiny Toy Guns , agh ! 
Sitting outside under the peacefulness of the night ... head tilted to the sky , listening to the music of the world and the light accompaniment of the rumble of traffic underneath it ... Life and nature are grand . 
Somebody went under a dock ; and there they saw a rock . It wasn't a rock ; it was a rock lobster ! 
Well , it was starting to snow in Auburn around 2pm ( I was on my way home at the time ... ) . Hopefully it sticks and GRCC gets canceled for tomorrow ; or a week ^_^ ... 
Look to the cookie and all your racial problems will be solved . The perfect combination of vanilla and chocolate ... just look to the cookie . 
Still half asleep ... thought I'd be able to rouse myself by lunch time , I guess not . The clam chowder was great though . Can't decide if it's a < PROPFIRST > fm or 98.1 fm day ... ( all things good or orchestral suites ? ) 
Too late my friends it's over , \ 
Memories broken . \ 
Nice to know ya , \ 
Guess that means This Is Goodbye ... 
You'll be Screaming Bloody Murder when you find out what Brown < PROPMALE > wrote . = 0 
Realizing we still kill the old way all throughout our doubts . 
Once upon a midnight dreary , \ 
I woke with something in my head . 
I'd love to have a thousand summers . Imagine the adventures possible without the worry of classes , work , money etc ... From driving across the lower 48 to hiking the entire length of the West Coast ; striking it < PROPMALE > with a modern day gold rush of sperm whale vomit . 
Talking with Meyer has left me with an urge to encircle my house with salt ... too bad it's midnight already . 
Looking to knock out our group project in math today , so three hour break , sorry , but you'll have to wait until next week . As for a playlist for the day ... hmm ? \ 
-> Dead to the World - Nightwish\ 
-> Live and Let Die - < PROPFIRST > McCartney (& Wings)\ 
-> Hanging by a Moment - Lifehouse\ 
-> Blood in My Eyes - Sum 41 
Lecture finished early today and < PROPFIRST > and I grubbed down at Subway ( too bad they aren't $5.00 anymore ... ) . \ 
Besides that it took the whole 3.5 hours to finish our math project . Knocked it out though , phew ... Rockin ' day so far ! \ 
Today's playlist -> Adding : Friday I'm in Love - The Cure 
I would like my Facebook friends to comment on this status , sharing how you met me . But I want you to LIE . That's right , just make it up . After you comment , copy this to your status , so I can do the same . I bet half won't read the instructions right ! 
Physics in 10 , then it'll be time to rock lunch with < PROPFIRST > ... and a crap ton of practicing when I get home =/\ 
A little < PROPFEMALE > told me to tell you to tune in to < PROPFIRST > fm ( 96.5 ) at 5:00 PM today . 
< PROPFIRST > Myren refused to take me to Funky Town yesterday ... and now Facebook hates me and keeps deleting my post , haha . 
CPA's tomorrow ... well , I'm ready for anything except for about 15 bars in the Feste Romane ( Movement I ) . Just watch , my CPA will be that spot exclusively ... 
I just spent the last couple minutes blanking out and starring at the wall ... eyes out of focus ... Time to retire for the night I guess . 
Is this your situation ? 
Actually had to park in the gravel pit today at GRCC ... it was a 12 minute one way trip to Physics from out there . First/last time I'm parking there . 
We need to spend a week at the beach this summer . Anyone up for going ... falling off the grid for a bit ? 
House is singing ... it's actually quite awesome . 
I've told you already . I'll Open Your Eyes to the fact there is No Reason . Just remember that there will Always be No Solution . It may be Over Your Head , but we're Better Off Dead . Everything is just falling to Pieces ... \ 
And now I have a Fat Lip ... 
A Bluejay is sitting on the hood of my car ... he won't stop starring too . Cray birds , I don't have any food left . 
Go to your profile . The top 5 friends in the sidebar are now your team in the upcoming Zombie Apocalypse . How screwed are you ? \ 
Great I only have 1 professional zombie < PROPMALE > on my team ... looks like we might not last that long . \ 
Team members : < PROPMALE > Pugh , < PROPFIRST > Clairmont , Deziree Iams , < PROPMALE > Smith and < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Lynch 
The old witchdoctor mechanic was able to , once again , resurrect it for a third time . \ 
The box is fixed . My zombified piece of junk will not die ! 
My dogs win the stupidity annoyance award of the week . They were growling and barking like rabid , wild hyenas along with freaking out like they would if an earthquake was a bout to happen . I expected an intruder or at least an unknown person might be snooping around our property ... well , the intruder was a stray cat ... wth . 
Can't seem to decide on a final scaling of the world in my novel ... country , continent , half the world ... which size ...? 
Listening to Ordinary World - Duran Duran ... it's a grand and beautiful day to relax for an in between classes nap . \ 
Oh and btw , that Blue < PROPFIRST > from last week is back on my hood ... I shouldn't have parked in the same spot . \ 
He's starring ... Xd 
I will never murder someone ; I now know this to be a fact . Mocha attacked < PROPFEMALE > and ripped open her ear . < PROPFEMALE > wouldn't quit shaking her head back and forth so the blood started to get everywhere ... walls , ceiling , carpet , hardwood , etc . Cleaning it all up was definitely a bugger and way to time consuming . Blood just doesn't like to come out . \ 
Hope you get better soon < PROPFEMALE > . 
Final term paper for the quarter to finish today ... so fun . \ 
I actually shaved off my beard today too . It was rather impulsive and halfway through I thought ... \Wait ! What did I just do that for ...? \ " I feel cold now . " 
Mocha is whining and trying to convince me she needs to go visit with < PROPFEMALE > ... the only thing that \needs\ " to be done concerns me and this bollocks term paper . " 
Term paper finished , ready to watch a movie and otherwise ecstatic my quarter has finally boiled down to two finals on Friday and nothing more ... what a grand estate the world is tonight . 
Way too much trolling ! Try watching the Endless Eight story arc in The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya anime all in one sitting ... eight episodes ( 25 minutes each ) all with the same story ! \ 
It . Is . Impossible !!! 
So going to hate tomorrow ... my two finals before Spring Break finally resemble stress factors . No longer do they seem to be intangible entities off in the distance somewhere . 
I dying of withdrawal here ... I need some randomness thrown into my life ; something unpredictable and sporadic . Why ... I need myself . I am ( well can be ) the most random and spastic person I know ... where and when is that actually going to be true again ? 
Inside the abyss lies an eternally slumbering one . A concept w/o bounds infects the minds of many ; therefore , creating a paradox unworthy of speculation in the material world . 
Chatin ' it up with my Uncle < PROPFIRST > atm . This past week has been really laid back ... just the same old same old recluse-ish stuff . Can't wait to get back into action and kick this dreadful lull . 
About ready to keel over and just submit to the night . 
All the same , \ 
take me away . \ 
We're dead to the world ... 
< PROPMALE > Ford attempting to fix the hyper-drive during a space battle is just plain classic . Chewie giving him the wrong tools make it that much better though ( as if they weren't pressed for time enough ) . 
Next Tuesday , only 6 days off , Screaming Bloody Murder finally hits shelves throughout the US . It's been quite the wait ; glad it's almost over though . 
And we danced , on the wave of the ocean romance . \ 
A repeat offense for the one who keeps returning ... I haven't thought of you much in the past few weeks , yet now the signs seem to keep popping up . I can feel the darkness drawing near . Into this lingering abyss we will commend ourselves ; the memories we share growing fainter as time ingrains them into our souls . Would you have it any other way ...? 
Grades are in for Winter quarter :\ 
PE 103 - 4.0 \ 
Physics 201 - 3.7 \ 
Math 153 - 3.5 \ 
Intro to Ficition - 3.5 \ 
Business 115 - Pass ( Pass/Fail Class)\ 
I'm actually looking forward to Spring quarter ... my last quarter . Doubt it'll be as fun as Winter quarter was . 
Screaming Bloody Murder was released on iTunes half an hour ago ; can't wait for a hard copy on the 29th ! XD 
If I were to sleep through the next few years , would you promise to wake me outside of time ? 
Audition at WSU tomorrow ... need to hit the sack in a few minutes cuz we'll hit the road tomorrow around 5 am . 
A six hour drive lies ahead of us as we leave the place of nonexistance ( the locals call it Idaho ... ) . Can't wait to be back inside the states . 
We're literally chasing the Sun across the horizon as the mountains in the distance begin to take on a new definition . \ 
It's here in the confines of my mind that I notice the subtlties in our natures that sculpt everything together into one masjestic masterpiece in the real world . < PROPFEMALE > Nesac and Alias < PROPFEMALE > are but two halves of D'on < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > ... 
Just passed the county border . Back in < PROPMALE > county once again . Ready to shoot myself for all these useless Facebook status updates as of late ... 
The farther down one ends up traveling , the slower and slower time seems to pass in eyes of those who remain on the surface . Time is but one essence of traveling inside alogirithms ... remained trapped inside the Crypt(N ) . 
Tonight I learned it takes me 1.5 mins to stack three golf balls on top of each other . = 0 
Reason to Believe may be better than No Reason ... can't wait to get my hands on a hard copy the day after tomorrow . Going to be pissed if they're sold out though ... 
35 mins to midnight ... goodnight , shall it be ? probably ... going to grab myself a hard copy of Sum 41's new album tomorrow and a new pair of < PROPMALE>'s 501s . \ 
Playlist update ? :\ 
-> Reason to Believe : Sum 41\ 
-> And We Danced : The Hooters\ 
-> Live and Let Die : < PROPFIRST > McCartney\ 
-> Hanging By a Moment : Lifehouse\ 
-> Dead to the World : Nightwish 
Coincidence shouldn't exist w/o some sort of hidden meaning lurking around the corner ... anyway , both my math professor and philosophy professor talked about singularities today in class ... apparently three dimensional math is the basis for singularities and where the name came from . Black holes = awesomeness . 
The one true way to a woman's heart is to knit her a sweater . 
Listening to Dvorak's New World Symphony ... not sure if I can keep myself from my last < PROPMALE > to attend EMF ... hmm , to go or not to go . 
So much rain ... wait , I like the rain though . it could be darker outside though , this grey is too light in colour . 
Ooh ... hmm , Doctor Who should be airing soon seeing as it's finally April . Sweetness <- awesomeness/great song by < PROPFIRST > Eat World ... 
I need to start carrying a camera with me whereever I end up going ... Saw a Blue Herrin ( or w/e it's called ) down by the stream on my way to orchestra this morning . An absolutely magnificent specimen . 
Bear Grylls is awesome . 
Just watched my cats give each other a bath and clean the insides of each others ears ... glad to be human . 
My wrist is on fire and has been since midday Saturday ... At least the rain is acting like an ice pack . Xd 
Mumford and Sons -> Little Lion Man\ 
Pretty much says it all for the playlist of this week . 
One class today ... guess I'll have to work on my joke of a senior project . To bad Comparative Religion is cancelled for today ; the lectures are always interesting . \ 
Trapped inside a mirror ? 
Time is the enemy . The Wyhrland and The < PROPFEMALE > of Night are but insignificant sparks compared to the dangers posed by the oroborus Time . 
Hmm , this Slenderman saga is becoming quite interesting ... what do say you other Slenderman followers ? Cousin , haha ?
