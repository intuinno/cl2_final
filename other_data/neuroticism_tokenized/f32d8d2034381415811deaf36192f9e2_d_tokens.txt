Dear fellow residents , \ 
Please keep your HANDS OFF my laundry . It finished a minute ago and I am on my way to retrieve it . There is NO REASON for you to take it out and pile it on top . There is also NO REASON for you to become angry with me when I am standing behind you and ask you to stop removing it , since I am there to do so myself . \ 
Thank you .
