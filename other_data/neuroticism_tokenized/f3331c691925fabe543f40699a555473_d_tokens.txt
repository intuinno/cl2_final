Cold is not fun . Went shopping today with all my christmas gift cards and everyone I asked to go with me said \Hell no . It's cold outside . \ " Go away cold so my friends will go outside again . " 
Mom is a tangerine stealing son of a gun . 
Hot pink . 
I danced with a stuffed animal in an elivator because that's how I roll . 
Went from rollerblading at the beach to getting stuck at a gas station with a shot battery . Had to have Bates jump me off , go get a battery , install it , turn in the core , then rush to meet my sister for lunch at 3 . Some day . So much for my check bonus . Car batteries are now 100 dollars fyi . 
Ladies night at Ultra tonight . Anyone going ? 
I'm a holy roller and I own a spaceship . 
YOOOO . Gasperillo in Tampa the last week of January ! WE SHOULD GO . We can all crash at Jenn's place , hah . Pirate costumes , lots of rum , get drunk in the Tampa streets ... I'm asking off for it . 
2 days in a row at the beach . YAY ! It was supposed to be 80 today though , and it was more like 70 with 50 mph winds . A bit chilly . Tan as a biscuit now though ! 
has the day off . Yay !

HI . 
wants a hug . 
Spent the day at the beach with mom , then we went for pizza and ice cream . The only thing that would have made the day better would be ... well , let's not go there BUT I can assure you it has nothing to do with a man ... unless he is in pain . Yes , pain would work . 
Staying inside with a pillow , a blanket , a movie , and a tissue . It's one of those days . 
Too cold for the beach until next tuesday . I am sooo tired of this nonsense . Where did all of the FL heat go ? 
Won't make it to the beach today :( Got called in for work .
