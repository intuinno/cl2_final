why so quiet steeler fans ? 
why does 1997 feel like so long ago ? 
OH - AICH - EYE - OH Is it me .... or does it feel like < PROPMALE > Rodriquez still coaches WVU & he brought ALL of his WVU players with them ... and they arent surviving in the Big 10 ? It really feels like Michigan closed .... and WVU replaced them ... and got owned by every Big 10 team but Indiana

is going to downtown Akron with Desko saturday night . Hit me up for more details ! 
New Rule : Catholics arent allowed to make fun of ANY other religion until they admit that what they do on ash wednesday is just plain creepy . However , I guess they are always happy when a catholic priest wipes something on a young boys face & it's just ash . - < PROPMALE > Mahr ( I really wish I could have taken credit for that one ) 
had my job upgraded today ! Couldnt be more excited !!! Time to celebrate .... now where is that < PROPFIRST > Daniels .... 
thinks the Browns should sign T.O. Why not ? Better to have an ass at WR than a rapist at QB 
My dad came in this weekend ; he gave me a copy of almost every song he had on vinyl from 1963-1985 .... I have no idea how/when to start to organize them into my itunes .... over 400 songs I guess it's a good problem to have !

If any women from my office want to- please come to the home opener with me < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > , and sean ... go down to the field , tell the indians to go work on 2020's in Canton all day , then proceed to beat the Texas Rangers .

surfing Pandora.com for some good new ( or old ) music .... anyone know any good music right now ?

Leaving for WV today - Really excited for this weekend ! 
I keep trying to ' decline , reject , ignore , not accept ' this tool from my high school that keeps trying to add me as his friend on here ... but it keeps saying ' request cannot be processed at this time ' WTF ?!?! To anyone I went to high school with - feel free to ask who it is .... and i will absolutly block you if you are friends with this tool ... hint : He graduated in 2002 & drove a Celica 
just ate at ' Outback ' with the fam - prob one of the best meals from a restaurant i've had in months - possibly years . I strongly recommend the Outback on Whipple ave . in Canton .... wow ! 
Things that are moronic : People that list their actual address and/or phone number on facebook 
The best month of the year is finally here !! The crisp air , the sight of the foilage , the smell of fires , the death of bugs , and dont even get me started on SPORTS !! 
Dear facebook : I'm glad that I am friends with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > on here too ... but STOP recommending that I become friends with everyone that she is !! 
Remember that everyone you meet is afraid of something , loves something , and has lost something . -- H . < PROPMALE > Brown Jr. 
How about those RANGERS !!!!!

My last day at the Stark County board of Developmental Disabiities is tomorrow - my 1st career oriented job after college . I'm really going to miss all of the individuals i've met & ... well ... some of the people in my office . haha it's been a great 4 years & really hope Summit County will be as fufilling as Stark County was 
New job at Summit & THE < PROPMALE > SHOW IS BACK !!!! HELL YEA !!!!! 
I voted today ; however i'll agree with Carlin when I say that those people that do not vote : have EVERY right to complain ; as they have in no way contributed to the situation the country is in . The two party system is a business machine that caters to those in the political ' middle ' anyway ; so to those of you that don't vote- feel free to bitch away - it's fucking < PROPFEMALE > & I support your decision ! 
Dear BMW driver on 77 south : I'M ALREADY GOING 90 & IN THE LEFT < PROPFIRST > - GET OFF OF MY ASS ! SLOW DOWN YOU STUPID DANGEROUS FUCK !!!! ... Sorry - had to get that out ; clearly i'm still getting used to the Akron ---> Canton afternoon drive !

Blackberry > Driod 
I'm currently investigating things that begin with the letter ' M ' ... have you any idea why a < PROPFEMALE > is like a writing desk ? 
Excited for work this week . There is nothing more exciting & rewarding than helping a wing of an organization modernize , changing the old way of thinking , and seeing that your staff is buying in ! 
watching dancing with the stars for the first time with the wife ... bristol palin made me throw up my christmas ale ... wow do I hate the new ' in your face ' palins . I'm voting for < PROPFEMALE > grey . 
O-H - 
If the Cavs beat Miami tomorrow night - the celebration in Northeast Ohio will be BIGGER than the one that would have taken place if LeBron wouldnt have quit in the playoffs 3 years in a row . 
I think I'll start ' unfriending ' people that put dumbass phrases in their status or photo albums that sound like fucking songs from the Lion < PROPMALE > . 
< PROPMALE > Henne + Ohio team = epic fail 
did the whole cartoon character facebook thing .... however < PROPFIRST > Desko has the best one i've seen yet ...

the < PROPFEMALE > family is so fortunate to have two teams in the fantasy football playoffs - some families don't have any ! 
I just saw where the Akron Zips won the national title at college soccer ... Not only do I still not care about that lame , boring , Eurotrash mess - i'm actually slightly embarassed for the people celebrating it . 
I would use facebook more if i could just ' wave ' at my friends on here - rather than ' poke ' them .... nasty 
Another perk of working for Summit County - Lake Effect Blizzard shuts down Summit , Cuyahoga , Medina , & Geauga counties - didn't have to get dressed today ! 
to people that post their horoscopes online : STOP THAT ! they are bullshit and boring for me to read ! get a job and a hobby 
steeler fan - how'd that one taste ?

' Blood tasts like dirty pennies ' . - < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ; SF Giants closer with the quote of the month ! 
Sometimes ... I think the amish have it right . -I could just build stuff with my hands and relax outside on days like this ... then I see them out somewhere & see their fucking TEETH - or I'll catch a buzz from a few drinks out on a padio somewhere - yup ; we are doing it right ! 
if not for Ninja Warrior , I'd be really bored today 
To my asshole mailman : STOP LEAVING FUCKING LETTERS IN MY MAILBOX ABOUT WHERE YOU WANT ME TO PUT MY OUTGOING MAIL - When my tax dollars fund your salary you need to be willing to step your fatass out of your party < PROPFIRST > & get the letters out of the back , or do whatever it takes to get the mail done right : MAKE ME A BICYCLE CLOWN !!!!! 
Gearing up for a weekend in West < PROPFEMALE > 
I want to conservatively describe acme grocery store tonight : 1st of the month , July 3 , December 30th , day before a snow storm , free lobster tails in every isle , free alcohol in every isle , bring all 4 of your fucking kids ...
