Today is the International Day for the Fight Against Cancer ... In memory of those who lost the battle against cancer , and those who continue fighting . I pray for a cure . 92% of you won't copy & paste this text to their Facebook profile status , will you ? I DID , for those I love . Proud to be part of the 8% . 
this morning : spilt coffee in cup holder as i drove out of driveway . removed coffee from cup holder , placed cup on console . reached for < PROPMALE>'s wet ones . knocked cup over , with boob , spilling more coffee . everywhere . drank last few sips of coffee . realized i had dropped a wet on in the coffee . mmm soapy . 
hope , pray , that < PROPMALE > does not think it's play time at 4am ever ever again . bless his little baby heart ! he's had such a hard week . hope his teeth cut in soon ! 
dear god i need a tan ! come on summer ! 
i do not understand why some people get so crazy about their wedding . maybe it is because we already have < PROPMALE > , but i just dont see what the big deal is . some of these girls are insane ! it's only as stressful as you make it ... yal can remind me of this statement in a few months when im freakin out lol . 
< PROPMALE > rolled over from tummy to back ! yay for the little man ! he was so proud of himself :) looove him ! 
yay 10.02.10 is MY wedding date & NO ONE ELSE better steal it :)

someone please find me a house on fort < PROPFIRST > road ( gulf side ) to get married at . im tired of looking . no one allows freakin weddings ! 
< PROPMALE > just looked at me and then chunked his toy on the floor and laughed when i gave him \the look\ " . should i encourage this kind of behavior ? " 
dress shopping with < PROPFEMALE > tomorrow ! ( we will miss you < PROPFEMALE >!) 
< PROPMALE > will be 6 months old tomorrow and i can finally fit back in my jeans ( they're tight , but they \fit \") so i guess the 15 lbs i still have to lose is in my chest ?? "

headed to arts and crafts . pray for a parking spot ! 
< PROPMALE>'s 6 mo check up went well . 23lbs 13 oz , 27\ long . i love that little man :) " 
im not a political person ... You might be working hard for your health care right now , what if you lose your job < PROPMALE > . & you have a family to support . Don't attack something just because it's new . Think about it for a little while , step outside of yourself . Let's all help eachother . We will all need a little help at some point . Be a good person , it will pay off eventually :) 
day is off to a bad start . hope it turns around quick . 
today has to be better than yesterday ! praying ...

o my goodness my poor little < PROPMALE > cut three teeth today . what a tough guy ! 
a hundred years from now it will not matter what my bank account was , the sort of house i lived in , or the kind of car i drove . But the world will be very different because i was important in the life of my child . 
out of dog food , out of toilet paper ( and paper towels ... and < PROPMALE>'s wipes ) , only 3 diapers left ... i just want to lay down , but instead i'll be making a run to the grocery store . woo hoo :( what a day . 
< PROPMALE > does not like < PROPFEMALE > . not one bit :( 
my hands and arms are all scratched to hell , pine needles cover the floor , and i just figured out where that light bulb popped ( the hard way ) . next year i will not underestimate the pre-lit artificial trees . 
< PROPMALE>'s 15 month update : 33 inches , 33.4 lbs ... one pound per inch ! 
My little < PROPMALE > is still asleep . He must be growing :)

woke up early to someone banging on my front door and my dogs going crazy ... but when I looked no one was there . A little freaked out . 
bought < PROPMALE > some converse :) he loves them 
trying to catch up on two weeks worth of house cleaning . what a weekend :/ 
< PROPMALE > is a sick puppy :( 
i spent entirely too much money on \sick supplies\ " at walgreens yesterday ( only the best for my son ! ) I splurged on one of those forehead scanners so I could take his temperature while he's asleep . ( like every 5 minutes ) It should really have a silent mode bc the incessant beeping is keeping my baby awake ! " 
banana !
