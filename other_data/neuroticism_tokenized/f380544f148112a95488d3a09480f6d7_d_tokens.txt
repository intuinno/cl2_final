70/100 presents on farmville . 
100/100 Presents for farmville :3 
Got a Wii and Wii fit for christmas ! Also a new camera ! Had a pretty amazing Christmas overall :] 
loves her family <3 
Happy 2011 . It better be an amazing year , or I'll ... erm ... ask it really nicely to be amazing . 
thinks the rat that her boyfriend bought her for Christmas might be pregnant o.o ... 
just looked at her rat . She's definitely getting fatter . If it is babies , anyone know someone who would want some ? NO JOKES ABOUT THEM BEING SNAKE FOOD ! :[ 
Pazuzu puppy is getting fixed today ! Poor Puppy . 
Zuzu came back from the vet . All is well . He's a little sleepy it seems , but other than that still my perky little puppy :] 
OMG the rat(Mimi ) had her babies !!! Little pinkies ! We seen about seven or so ! They sound adorable ! Remember guys , they are going to need homes ! 
Went up a size on(down ? ) my ears , went from 20G to 16G . Doesn't really look like it though ... but it felt like it XD 
doesn't want her vacation to end so soon ! :[ 
needs money ... so is going to try and get a real job . 
Zuzu has to wear a muzzle most of the time these days . HE MUST LEARN NOT TO NIP PEOPLE ! He just gets CRAZY excited to see people ; hopefully this will help him learn . The next step is not jumping on anyone . He just doesn't realize how big he is Dx 
One of the rat babies had it's foot in it's mouth just like a human baby !!! IT WAS SO ADORABLE !!! I wish I could have had a picture of it !!! 
Took Zuzu to the vet . She says it seems like something really small ; gave us pain meds and sedatives so he will just stay off of it and give it some time to heal on it's own . He gets to be a drug zombie for about a week ... poor Zuzu . 
Just found out two people from \The Cottage\ " quit and a friend put in a good word for me there . I might have a paying job soon . " 
is such a baby . I nearly cried when I was telling my advisor I would have to stop volunteering at the NICCC and find a place that pays . I'm going to be homeless I just know it :[ but I freakin ' love those kids so much ... 
SO ... One of the teacher people that work with the special needs kids at NICCC is going to get me an application for her place ! She said that she thinks I would be a great canidate to work at a place like that AND she'd even reccommend me ! <3 So if the cottage doesn't come through I have a backup plan ! YAY ! 
No one has ever told me that I look like a celebrity ... the only thing I can think of is Shannon/Kimber ? told me I looked like a porn < PROPFEMALE > from a certain porno but I don't even remember her name >.< 
wants a kid of her own already sometimes ... is that creepy ? I get envious of pregnant women ... I must be super weird ... :3 
I chose my celebrity for doppleganger week or whatever ... thanks for all the help /sarcasm . It doesn't look like me , but it's pretty amazing anyway . Can you guess who it is ?! :3 
Has a Saturday child development class from 9 to 330 tomorrow ... :[ 
Zuzu seems fine now ! Thank goodness !!! <3 <3 <3 <3 
YAY saints !!! 
Is a little afraid to see her test scores for this class ... :( 
thinks she's getting sick ... seriously ... 
Anyone looking for a baby rat ? They need homes ASAP ! 
4-5 BABY RATS NEED HOME ! Come on . I'll be your best friend if you find anyone who wants them before I give them to < PROPMALE>'s . 
I have a terrible headache still and I have to go to school for a test :[ Hopefully I feel better tomorrow . 
EASY test ! Took me like 15 minutes and I even did it with a terribe headache . 
Throbthrobthrob that's all I feel . My brain is going to explode . And I can't see out of my left eye . Migrains make me want to die . fml 
No class tonight !!! My lucky day !!!! Teacher is sick ! 
Baby sitting < PROPMALE > again <3 
For some reason I just want to dance and rave around ! Gimme some glowsticks somewone ! Disturbiaaa , Disturbiaaaaaaa Bom Bom < PROPFEMALE > Dom Bom bom be dom dom 
Bom Bom < PROPFEMALE > Dom Bom bom be dom dom , Bom Bom < PROPFEMALE > Dom Bom bom be dom dom ... 
On the friendquiz app I just hit ' no ' 40 times without reading the question . My answers aren't accurate anymore :D 
Can't read my , Can't read my , No he can't read my poker face . Can't read my , Can't read my , No he can't read my poker face . P-p-p-poker face , p-p-p-poker face . 
My six 0'clock Child development class teacher(Kathy ) , is really hard to listen to for two and a half hours straight . It just seems to drag on ... and on ... and on . Her voice is so loud and she goes off into tangents a lot repeating things over and over . And I have her TWICE a week . The classes are not hard to pass ... but they are hard to sit through . I wish attendence wasn't required >.< 
I wish people would stop saying that we are \overdue\ " for af natural disaster as far as 2012 is concerned(when they try to reason that the world will end ) . It doesn't even make sense . Gambler's Fallacy anyone ? I'm just eavesdropping on a fat guy trying to convince some other guy that the world is going to end . It's really annoying . " 
Today is going by too fast ... 
Saturday classes completely ruin the whole weekend . Someone make it better for me <3 
I hate people that play guitar and feel the need to < PROPFEMALE > it around and then everytime they see a crowd of people they sit and play it . Idiotic attention seekers . 
has newfound hate for the new part timer at NICCC ... she doesn't do anything but sit there . She didn't even try to help out with rest just sat there and stared while two of the kids were being really disruptive and making it hard for others to rest . Don't even get me started on lunch or group . I can only do so much at one time ! Grrr today was stressful . 
Is getting a random fever . Where did this come from ? 
is very sick . Got some preventative things though . Will be staying in bed ALL day tomorrow so I can make it to the children's center Monday :D 
Ugh , might have to go to the doctor again ... I don't seem to be getting better . 
My throat hurts , my head hurts , I have a high fever , I can't breath out of my nose because it is stuffed up(can't breathe through my mouth because it hurts my throat ) , my ear also is beginning to hurt because it is stuffed up , so I can't hear out of one ear and my balance is shot , so I can't walk or drive , which means no Children's Center today and I can't go to class either , and I have to be driven to the doctor at 2 . /FML 
I am sad ... my poor Wonderweiss ... died :[ I shall name a rat after him :D 
Is feeling 80% better . Hoping that tomorrow I will be the full 100% ! 
Deaf coffee night in an hour ! 
Went to deaf coffe night and stayed for 3 hours hah , I will be going back ^^ 
Nothing on the agenda for tomorrow ... someone fix that ;] 
Spring break is over :( can I have one more week please ?... I hope I got all my homework done ... I keep thinking that I just have to be patient for a long summer break ... But then I remember ' oh wait you don't GET to have a break ' >.< 
I want it to storm beyond belief ... Thunder and lightning , wind and power outages ... I think I might be getting homesick :] 
I only have to stay at school until 4:15 today !!! Yay ! 
Zuzu is going to get his Canine Good Citizen Certification . His classes start next Friday :D . This basically means that if he ever does anything wrong(animal control wise ) , he won't be immediately put down or anything . Also he will be considered safe in the community(even nursing homes and schools ) . When he's done with the training please refer to him as Pazuzu , CGC . Haha . :D 
If anyone is interested in learning ' Baby signs ' as far as sign language goes , Monday my ASL teacher is having a lesson at NIC open for anyone to come and learn about it , text me for time and place ( 208-818-9798 ) 
\No you can't get near them ! Baby earthworms suck your blood ! \ " -NICCC ( 5yrold ) " 
\If it is wet and not yours don't touch it . \ " Some of the best advice I've ever recieved . " 
\My fishy died and he had to be flushed down the toitet to fishy heaven\ " -NICCC ( 3yrold ) " 
\She wants boomboom . \ " -The Boyfriend " 
I keep forgetting my Disney CDs at the children's center Dx !! I need to write a sticky note and stick it to my forehead T.T 
Zuzu has to go to the vet again , no puppy class until he's healed ... He hurt ANOTHER paw jumping around like he's crazy . We tried to wait a week in confinement to see if it would heal on it's own but no . I'll be kind of relieved when his energy levels come down to ... Oh say normal dog levels maybe ? 
I gave blood today !!! It was amazing , after three years of wanting to and never being able to . I can wait to do it again in June !! 
Tonight is Deaf \Mic\ " Night . It is going to be so amazing . It's at NIC in the SUB at 7 PM ! Anyone want to come feel free :] " 
Deaf story night was amazing !!! Epic amazing ! 
Loving life :) 
Is jealous of < PROPFIRST>'s new boyfriend :[ 
Wants to play Mass Effect . :D 
Monday again ... Why must the weekends go by so quickly ? 
\I'm a damsel . I'm in distress . I can handle this . Have a nice day . \ " -Megara from the movie Hercules " 
can't seem to get enough sleep for some reason ... am I getting sick again ? 
I had a dream I had a pet wolf , pretty amazing :] 
Had a great time with my mom and sister today <3 Iron man 2 was pretty amazing :D 
Finals week ... yay . It won't be too bad though ; I only have one more final left to take on Tuesday . ^^ 
I forgot what it feels like to not have to wake up early for the Children's Center ... It's kinda relaxing ... but I have to study today for my final at 7pm tonight . All Day Cram session begins ... right after I finish my Fruit Loops :D 
\My goal is to not wake up aged 40 thinking I've wasted my life because I had to choose a career path while still in my teens . \"- Daria " 
\Sometimes I lie awake at \ 
I need some friends that I can go out and do things with ... I don't know how to make new friends though ... I'm so lame . 
The kiddies are napping , I'm babysitting them 7:30 - 5:30 Monday thru Thursday this week . Today has been a good day so far ! Let's hope it can continue ! 
Kiddies are sleeping again , rough start today but it's still been good despite the rain . I feel like taking a nap though :] 
Today has been a very off day ... Hopefully after a nice rest it'll be better . >.> 
Kids are resting again , today's my last day , three day weekend for me , yay ! 
Doing nothing on a Saturday , funfun . 
Kiddies are sleeping , tomorrow I'm going to have them make their own ice cream :D 
I'm sleepy today ... I also just got beat at that memory game by a 4 year old ... Dx 
Two babysitting jobs back to back . I'm going to be TIRED tonight . 
Monday I start my summer classes . Hip-hip-hooray . 
Excited for yoga class in the morning :] 
Yoga was fun , sign language seems like it is going to be a little bit challenging since it is squished into 8 weeks instead of 16 , but I think it'll go well . Now I get to work on my two internet classes before I go babysit . What kind of birthday is this ?! XP 
Thank all of you guys for the birthday wishes yesterday :] 
I absolutely LOVE yoga . It has seriously helped me find the center of things and let me know that it's okay to slow down and enjoy the now . So ... I'm going to juggle some classes majorly next semester and try to see if I could possibly work at NICCC next fall instead of 23874 credits :] 
Changing over , I have a new Window's Live Account >> chelsea_kalla@yahoo.com 
So ... I keep waking up with my eyes super bloodshot . Can't figure out why it is all of a sudden ... I assume I'm sleeping with my eyes open XP 
The sun burns my eyes , I put sunscreen on for 1 or 2 hours of standing outside and I still get burned ... This has all started since my 19th birthday ... I must have turned into a vampire . 
Such a beautiful day ... and I get to visit the women's doctor ... wonderful ... 
I hate it when it is < PROPFEMALE > . All the pedestrians are out in CDA ... I hate pedestrians >:[ ( When I am driving anyway ) 
I want to see The Last Airbender SO BAD ! It's coming out Thursday wew ! :D 
ZomgZ !!! Just got my Hitachi Magic Wand :D !!! So Excited !!! 
just came back from a date with the boyfriend ... <3 He's amazing . 
Confused beneath the light , I bow my head in front of the tomb , The feeling must continue , Laying quiet above the shadows , Florescent \ 
against the tomb , I absorb quiet demons against the towers , In \ 
slumber I know The < PROPMALE > will come ... But not before creating sinning \ 
witches under the fire . 
Was going to go to deaf coffee night , but now I'm babysitting ... hopefully next week ._. 
Made 85 dollars this weekend babysitting . Nice . Must make it to deaf coffee night next week . 
I want an ice cream from the dollar menu at McDonalds >.> 
Two weeks of summer school left ; I will be finishing with straight A's :] 
We did \restorative yoga\ " today in class . BEST YOGA EVER ! :D " 
Got part time job at children's center , going to deaf coffee night tonight , and playing old playstation games ... life is freaking amazing :] 
Just had a water balloon fight and played in the sprinkler . Yes , I am a child development < PROPMALE > :]] 
I slept 18 hours yesterday . Just got out of a much needed bubble bath ... can't believe tomorrow is Monday :[ 
I wish I was beautiful . 
This coming weekend is my last one before school/work starts ... I need some friends to do something with :[ 
Open house tomorrow for the kids ! I'm so excited to see them all again :]]]] 
Who's not doing anything this weekend ?! We should < PROPFEMALE > out :] All together no matter who you are . >.> 
Hello :) 
Went to the farmers market and petco ... Errands ftw :) 
Thrifting ! I got a giant bear , 2 playstation games , and an OLD tarot card set ... All for under 5 dollars :) 
Second Day of Fall Semester waiting for my TaiChi class ... wondering if I can do TaiChi in my jeans haha . 
On my 30 minute break ... Woohoo :) 
I wanna go to the fair O.O 
Looked up things about the fair . 8 dollars to get in and 30 dollars for the carnival(unlimited rides ) ... so expensive :[ 
Going to the fair right this very moment ! Yay fair !!! 
The fair was super crazy amazing ! Got to see < PROPFEMALE > in action , had my first elephant ear and < PROPFEMALE > apple , rode rides that I never would ride before , got to pet a bunch of animals , had my palm read ... Glad I spent it with the best guy ever <3 
Back to school and work :( full of LAME ! 
Had to park in the gravel parking lot today :[ was running late . 
It is so cold outside :( 
Waiting for my music class to start . 
so ... We have just been ... As my sister put it , ' ding < PROPFIRST > ditched ' :( freakin middle schoolers are getting every house on the block :((( 
Glad it is a four day week ... Going to a concert friday :D 
Sleepy ... and wondering why I can't seem to wear the right kind of clothes for the weather . Yesterday I was too cold ... now I fear I will be too hot ... I'll never win against this annoying Idaho weather /emo-tear 
Just came back from the story of the year concert ... Was in the pit ! Right next to the stage , Touched the lead singers hand haha ... Pretty awesome time with my sister :) completely worth it . 
Can't believe it's already Monday ! Why can't the weekend last longer :[ ? 
Only Tuesday ???! 
So might be babysitting tomorrow night until 10pm . I am such a push over . I barely have enough time to breathe . 
It's going to be one long day today . 7:00 am- 10:00 pm+ I might die . Seriously . I honestly don't know what will be keeping me awake ... and sane for that matter . 
Not babysitting after all :D I can go to sleep on time !!! Yayness 
Raining today ! It's put me in such an amazing mood . I LOVE rain :] 
According to a fortune cooking from three months ago , today is suppose to be a lucky day for me ... :] 
So maybe yesterday was suppose to be lucky because of how bad today is going ... and it's only been an hour . :[ 
Today will be a better day for everyone . I command it and it shall be done >:[ 
Wants to transfer to a college on the east coast that doesn't require me to harvest my organs to get into it . Any suggestions ? I was looking at < PROPFEMALE > and OH :] 
“Today you are You , that is truer than true . There is no one alive who is Youer than You . ” - Dr. Seuss 
Won a hat today in ASL :D 
Hates Dutch Bros . >:[ They don't have white coffee there ! Hates the Educated Cup(at NIC ) , they have white coffee but no white chocolate power(only syrup ) AND they are horridly overpriced , Hates ' jitterz ' because their white coffee was yucky and the lady that made it was a big jerk ... >.< No one can beat Mugsy's so far :D 
Had a great time with < PROPFIRST > :] Sunday should be < PROPFIRST > -day ^^ 
Had a pretty terrible day , but my co-workers made it so much better . I love you all :] 
Mugsy's is amazing . On Friday's I can get a 24oz white chocolate , white coffee with three shots for 3.50 . No one can beat that . Everywhere else it's 4.00 + 
It's RAINING ! I love rain ! I literally parked far away so I could walk in it . I seriously want to just stand outside in the rain . I wish I lived in a place that was rainy 24/7 <3 
I have decided that I am not a ' hugger . ' Unless it's someone I know extremely well , it makes me uncomfortable . Some kid I barely know came at me with ' hug arms ' while I was sitting down and he must not be able to understand body language when I curled up and made squeaky noises . I should \Use my words\ " and perhaps I could have avoided being the victim of a forced hug . Do not want . >:[ " 
Sorry I don't agree with the counter-protest against < PROPFIRST > Phelps . \ 
Even if this counter-protest is supposed to be peaceful , there is no guarantee that everyone at will continue to be peaceful under any \ 
circumstance . To say that we can control the emotions of an entire \ 
counter-protest is bold . If someone acts out in any sort of negative \ 
fashion , then he's won again . Why take the < PROPMALE > ? I am pro-ignoring the idiot . 
So the < PROPFIRST > Phelps thing is annoying . I hope they don't get the counter-protest permit , I love the idea of an alternative event in the SUB or whatever(was talking to < PROPFIRST > in ASL this morning ) . It makes so much more sense to draw people away from them , then to go head to head people like them . I would DEFINITELY support an alternative event AWAY from their protesting . 
White coffee ... the perfect beginning to a Friday :] 
My weekend was full of cleaning , homework , and projects ... except for today . Today I put on sweatpants and relaxed ... completely worth it . 
So what's everyone doing for Halloween ? 
I suffer from a disease known as indifference . 
The protests are just silly ... It's 30 people screaming against 5 people just standing there ... Woohoo we'll show them 5 people /sarcasm 
It's been a slow start this morning , somehow I feel like that's how the rest of the day is going to be . 
Just got Netflix and it is AMAZING !!! 
Going to the corn maze tonight at 6ish :] 
Some girl stole my comfy love seat in Boswell . :[ 
I am so sleepy . My eyes keep closing involuntarily and my head falls forward . I might have to take a nap with the kids today . 
My boobs hurt from being in the infant room at NICCC . Maternal senses .... tingling ! Lol . 
Being in the infant room is amazing . Fin . 
Someone stole my couch in Boswell ! If anyone at NIC has seen where they moved an off-white , speckly looking couch that use to be on the second floor of Boswell let me know :[ 
My couch is back ! Yay ! I don't know where it went or who brought it back , but thanks :D 
I didn't get to be in the baby room today :[ 
I have so much homework . I might just explode ! 
Got to snuggle with all the babies today ! I am learning so much :] 
Sooo , I want a haircut , suggestions anyone ? 
I'm very very sick :[ 
Still very very sick . just need to make it through 2 days and then I can rest . ODing on Motrin and Benadryl ... I don't know how safe it is for me to drive in the snow ... 
Spun out once , hit 2 curbs , got stuck in the snow at the stop sign , had to dig my car out ... all while going 15 mph ... The good thing is ... even though NIC may not be canceled yet ... all the classes I would be going to have canceled ... NIC should take a hint ;] 
Will someone fill out my UofI application for me , because I'd rather poke needles in my eyes . Also I don't understand the answers to some of the questions , or how to obtain the answers ... :[ 
Almost Christmas break ! 
File :/ /Chelsea/the_application_has_run_out_of_memory/error_exe/application_will_now_close/hold_alt_and_press_F4_to_continue 
Things < PROPFEMALE > has learned #1 : Do not text while driving , or you will be cut in half . 
Things < PROPFEMALE > has learned #2 : If you want to be healthy , eat things that aren't fun to eat . 
Going to sleep all day tomorrow :[ 
Had a fun day with < PROPFEMALE > :] 
I hope everyone had an amazing Christmas :] 
Had crazy fun at < PROPFEMALE>'s house with her and < PROPMALE > ! I NEED to get Just Dance for the Wii ... tomorrow . Best Wii game ever ! Pazuzu is so worn out from playing with Link he collapsed on the floor asleep . 
Slept until 1:30 pm and stayed in my PJs the rest of the day , showered at 6pm and now I'm in bed again . I forgot how much I enjoy sleeping . 
Thinking about dropping Education 201 ... She's telling me I need to pay 40 more dollars to get my fingerprinting done ... again . Because the ones before ... don't ... count ? 
I wanna go jump some more ! Super fun with < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > :] 
Sitting around doing nothing and still in my jammies o.o 
Must . Do . Homework . 
I hate hate hate hate parking at NIC >:[ 
< PROPMALE > passed away 2/4/11 ... Cried and/or slept all weekend ... ._. 
So I guess I cried so much I made myself sick ... Literally ... Oh joy . 
I love my momma <3 <3 <3 
Oh-woah-oh . 
If enough people boycott tomorrow , perhaps we can create another random holiday to have off of work and school ... Anybody for this idea ? 
I want a tattoo .... at some point . 
I need a summer job that will let me go to school 8- 10:30 am Monday through Thursday ... :[ 
My mommy won't answer her phone and it makes me worry ._. 
Happy Anniversary to < PROPFIRST > and I ! 2 years and counting , keep em ' coming <3 
Quote of the day : \It's a < PROPFEMALE > pack bitches ! \ " - < PROPFEMALE > Geiger Ochenkoski "
