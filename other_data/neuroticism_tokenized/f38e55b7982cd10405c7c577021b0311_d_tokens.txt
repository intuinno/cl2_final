Staring contest ? I thought it was a blinking contest and I was loosing . 
1 in 10 people born are gay . That means 1 of 10 people are instantly put down , given bad labels , left alone , put in a minority and so much more , all for something they didn't ask for . Many gay teens are committing suicide as a way of escaping . If you want to tell them life will get better and ... you respect them for who they are , copy and paste this into your status . Most won't , but let's see the 5% of you who will .

Dear Dentist lady , \ 
I'm sorry you're single on yet another < PROPFIRST>'s day but that is no reason to shove the little mirror into my mouth so hard I think I might have bruises , and to poke my cheeks with the wires .
