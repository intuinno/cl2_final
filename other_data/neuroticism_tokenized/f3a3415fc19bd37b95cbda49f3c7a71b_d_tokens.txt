I will not die , i'll wait here for you \ 
I feel alive , when you're beside me\ 
I will not die , i'll wait here for you\ 
In my time of dying 
Livin ' in a world so cold\ 
Waistin ' away\ 
Livin ' in a shell with no soul\ 
Since you've gone away\ 
Countin ' the days\ 
Since you've gone away ... 
I'm on the edge and falling off/and I'm sick of feeling numb/Help me believe it's not the real me/Maybe we can turn it around/Cause it's not too late/I'm standing here alone/feeling so stepped on/It wont be long until I'm burning on the inside/I just don't care anymore/That it drags me down/Things are clear/I will not die/We are one . 
How could i have been so stupid , to believe you , miss you , hold back tears for you , try and forget you , remember you , and hate myself for u ? 
I FOUND MY THUMB DRIVE GUYS !!!!!! :D 
I CAN NOW PLAY \Last to Know\ " ON PIANO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <3 " 
If you only knew . 
The puppy chewed my phone charger ... there goes #4 . 
so ... do you add people you barely know : yes or no ? 
Yeah . 
Sometimes i wonder if im really as bad as the things she thinks . 
When anybody says your name \ 
I wana run away \ 
I keep remembering \ 
I can't forget you \ 
It doesn't matter what i try \ 
it happens anyways \ 
Its been forever \ 
and I can't forget you \ 
With every single day \ 
It won't go away \ 
The way i feel about you \ 
And when its said and done \ 
You're the only one \ 
And I can't regret you \ 
So i can't forget you 
i got Eclipse in the mail today !!!!!! 
Don't look so low , you're starting to drag me under . Don't let them know , or you're gonna blow our cover ... <3 
I opened a box full of secrets where the strongest of thoughts couldn't keep them \ 
And even though I was the last to know , they were livin inside \ 
When you see through the darkness and find the solution \ 
How quickly your eyes will remove the illusion \ 
You know our life is gonna change in the blink of an eye <3 
I look to the sky but there's nobody watchin \ 
Left here behind all alone and forgotten \ 
So now the world belongs to me \ 
To live and to die by the word that is spoken \ 
The legend's a lie and the silence is broken \ 
So now the world belongs to me , the world belongs to me .. <3 ;) 
Four Letter Lie <3 
Im sorry you couldnt sleep :) but i swear , i didnt mean for it to be my fault <3 
Live in < PROPFEMALE > . Sing it out . Scream at the top of your lungs so the whole world knows how you feel <3 
And you've got me , right where you want me\ 
You always know , how to bring me down\ 
Let's just face it now , im never changing ... \ 
You are my world , my everything\ 
You stupid boy , you're gonna be the death of me\ 
So let me go , just let me be\ 
You stupid boy , you love the way you're killing me ... <3 ( Stupid Girl- FH )

You know that it all takes my breath away .. \

Super psyched for the practice sessions to come with < PROPFIRST > Rabideau !!! She's one of my bestiess <3 and i hope im one of herss ^_^

Do you have any idea what you do to me ? 
Physics was SO funny today xD so glad < PROPMALE > Tadpole Zucker and < PROPFIRST > Peryer are my lab partners 
Id like to think that when i dream of you , you're thinking of me . But i know that's not reality . 
Mat Devine I love our conversations xD we talk about the most random things 
Asya < PROPFEMALE > Somody we REALLY need more girl friends xD or we need to find new guy friends because our current ones are corrupting our minds ! 
If asked any of these questions , i would say ... \ 
No rain ? - \That sounds positively dreadful . \ " \ 
Finally home , coloring with < PROPFEMALE > . Yes . Coloring . It may seem child-ish but i dont care if it is ^_^ Im on my 5th cup of tea and we are listening to Liar Liar by Nevershoutnever 
Oh .. bye the way . Im awesome xD 
Something's not working right in this car , \ 
I've got < PROPMALE > to go with a hurting heart . 
The day is gone now , completely wasted . I couldve done many other things much more productive with all that time . 
when all you got to keep is strong\ 
Move along , move along like I know you do\ 
And even when your hope is gone\ 
Move along , move along just to make it through\ 
Move along ..

Red : i love you ? \ 
Pink : your cute ;) \

Happy Christmakkah everyone !! <3 
Welcome to my world\ 
Where everyone I ever need always ends up leaving me alone\ 
Another lesson burned\ 
And I'm drowning in the ashes\ 
Kicking\ 
Screaming\ 
Welcome to my world ... <3 \ 
Sick Puppies 
I sat as far away from you in that < PROPFEMALE > car as I could . I hate to give you the satisfaction of my staying silent and listening . I reside to the part that I play , but I refuse to give in to you . 
\Was it a fever that took her ? \ " \ 
Now that I'm strong I have figured out , \ 
How this world turns cold and it breaks through my soul <3 
Beauty In the Breakdown <3 
This heart , it beats , \ 
Beats for only you <3 
Is a weenie . 
I'm going to see Apocalyptica !!!!!!!! & possibly Black Veil Brides , and All Time Low <3 
Its 11:11 and im wishing for you <3 
This heart .. It beats , beats for only you . My heart is yours <3 
This withered mind has long forgotten the bitter taste of tears 
? ' ?????. 
Puttin my head in the books and getting the homework done , then off for a weekend full of making MUSIC <3<3<3 NeverSayNever has got me so pumped <3 
I walk the line of the disappointed , \ 
I celebrate when im in pain . \ 
My heart and mind , \ 
Can be disjointed . \ 
I built a bed in this hole i have made . \ 
I recognize that i am damaged , \ 
I sympathize that you are too . \ 
I wanna breathe without feeling so self-concious , \ 
But its hard when the world's staring at you .. <3 
The best lies are told with fingers crossed\ 
\i love you\ " is 8 letters ... \ 
I don't understand . :( 
I'm sick of this place . 
I try to make it through my life , \ 
In my way , there's you\ 
I try to make it through these lies , \ 
And thats all i do\ 
Just dont deny it , dont try to fight this , \ 
And deal with it . That's just part of it . \ 
I try to make you see my side , \ 
I always try to stay in line\ 
But your eyes see right through , thats all they do . \ 
Im getting buried in this place , \ 
I got no room youre in my face . \ 
Dont say anything , just go away . 
Hold on to the world we all remember fighting for , there's some strength left in us yet\ 
Hold on to the world we all remember dying for , there's some hope left in it yet 
Now I am mute despite myself , all of them are gone . \ 
The silence over takes me , the idle words forsake me and I am left to face me . \ 
I'm held accountable , for every idle word . Curse the idle words ... 
And its almost like your heaven's trying everything to break me down .. 
Finding beauty in negative spaces .. 
I don't have wings , so flying with me won't be easy .. Cause I'm not an angel , I'm not an angel ..
