You can laugh/ A spineless laugh/ We hope that your rules and wisdom choke you/ Now we are one / In everlasting peace 
Please could you stop the noise , I'm trying to get some rest/ From all the unborn chicken voices in my head/ What's this ? ( I may be paranoid , but not an android ) .......... on a radiohead drug trip :D 
But , see , amid the mimic rout/A crawling shape intrude ! /A blood-red thing that writhes from out/ The scenic solitude ! / It writhes ! It writhes ! With mortal pangs/ The mimes becomes its food/ And the angels sob at vermin fangs/ In human gore imbued . 
You don't see them , you don't---but I see them : they are hunting me down , I must move on . ( Quoted by T.S. Eliot at the beginning of Sweeney Agonistes )

We're making history here , people . I venture to assert that the reason for the first snow day at Colgate in god-knows-how-many years is because of the awesomeness of the Class of 2014 .
