How does this whole taggin people on facebook status ' work ....... < PROPFEMALE > Bruckner < PROPFEMALE > Cutnaw DID IT WORK !? 
I feel like I've won the lottery when ever I open up a reeses and it has 2 wrappers . I feel like I beat the system ... 
Ash Ketchum is still only 10 yet < PROPFEMALE > is now 12 ( even though she was 10 when the series started ) and how do you actually become a pokemon master ? Seriously , Ash has 35 badges right now . 
Anyone want to come over tonight for a campfire party ?! 
I dont understand logic . 
Just spent the last hour on the phone with < PROPFIRST > Crawford , criticizing Disney Channel in a British accent . 
Forensics tomorrow ..... 
I was up at 5 for 4N6 , great job team ! I think it went pretty well and we were back in time for the game at 7 , go bulldogs , great win ! Finally home at 10:30 .... I wore my heels for 17 and a half hours ..... 
NEW < PROPFEMALE > TONIGHT !!!!!!!!!!!!! WHOOP ! WHOOP ! ( Dont question it . Just let me have my freak out moments today without criticism ) 
Its been an absolutly fantasticly amazing week ! 
Zoey 101 is on ! And I am surprised to say that I remembered all the words to the theme song when it came on ... 
Had an AMAZING dinner now I'm watching < PROPMALE > 10 and waiting for the < PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland sneak peak , and Glee tonight ! 
I love my family . They are downstairs experimenting with flamibility in out kitchen , and exploding beer bottles in our sink using contrasting temperatures . 
Ok , so I personaly loved New < PROPFEMALE > . People need to not have there hopes so high . If you didnt like Twilight then you most likely wont like New < PROPFEMALE > , its not like they were going to completely recast all the characters ... so , yeah , I liked it so dont rain on my parade . =) 
eating some really really gross Coke Gummi's ., but cant seem to stop . Other news : watching < PROPMALE > Potter and the Sorcerers Stone and its showing all these behind the scenes stuff from < PROPMALE > Potter and the Lightning Thief ( I'm thinking that we should atttempt to convince Mrs. Armstrong or Mr. Humphries to let us go on a field trip to see it ) 
just realized that in nearly every single one of my profile pictures , I'm wearing a costume .... and pretty happy about it too . 
Imagine you have a < PROPFEMALE > cat in the palm of your hand . You place a poisonous sardine in the palm of your hand with the cat , then close your fist . The cat is in your dark fist , with the sardine that will surely kill it . You , however , don't know whether the cat will eat the sardine or leave it alone . Only the cat knows , and has a choice in the matter . 
IMDB APP . FOR THE IPHONE ! ( I have been seriously waiting for this since I got my Iphone ) 
I know that I've got issues , but you're pretty messed up too . Either way , I found out I'm nothing without you . ' Cause we belong together now . Forever united here somehow . You got a piece of me and honestly , My life would suck without you ! 
Watching movie trailers . Cant wait for < PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland , Day Breakers , The Wolfman , The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus , Sherlock Holmes , and Shutter Island I also finally saw the trailer for The Lighning Thief ... and my respect for that movie significantly changed . I cant wait to see that too . 
\Dont you know what DA stands for ? \ " Reply 1 : District Attorney ? Reply 2 : DUMBLEDORES ARMY ! " 
I need to speak with whoever does < PROPFIRST > Lambert's eye makeup . 
AHHH ! My new laptop wont let me on Cafe World ! It says its been parental blocked due to gambling ! My meals are going to spoil ! 
If only I was a wizard ... 
Had an absolutely brilliant day . It was \quite amazing \"." 
What a great way to end 2010 ( no sarcasm implied ) . 
How are you ? 
How many of you would be \interested\ " in an < PROPFEMALE > in Wonderland dance for the Fayetteville museum of < PROPMALE > ? Hmm ? " 
Snape . Snape . Severus Snape . 
Im < PROPMALE > Potter . School is for Loosers . Im totally awesome ! 
It's the 11th day of 2010 ... how many resolutions have you already broken ? 
I laughed so hard I cried today . I love English class . 
Rain =D 
I went to pick you a flower , but it was a < PROPFEMALE > fly trap and it bit my head , so I killed it and got you this piece of grass instead . 
Turn to < PROPFEMALE > 394 . That < PROPFEMALE > in my biology book is on genetic mutations . Coincidence ? I think not . 
Im a therapist . I dont fix your problems I just point the way . 
Go play Icy Tower ... and try to tell me its not intense . 
I stalk you in my dreams . (: 
We're gypsies . We weigh our decisions very carefully when dealing with the outside world . The path of the least resistance is sometimes the wisest .

Oppugno , fighting off heart break since < PROPFEMALE > 302 . 
is one of those people who likes snow , but mostly just the aspect of looking at it from inside bundled up in blankets sipping hot coco .... unless , of course , I have a bunch of friends over for a snowball fight . (: 
needs some official proof that there is no school tomorrow , so that I don't end up being the only one at school .... 
< PROPFIRST > Clayman is the exact definition of a muggle . 
Viktor I love you , Viktor , I do . When we're apart my heart beats only for you ! 
Poor , poor , possessed < PROPFIRST > Locke ..... 
I don't want to jump on the bandwagon , I want to jump off and stay off forevermore . 
I can not explain the excitement that I just felt when I ran across the X-Men Evolution series on Hulu ... 
I love how Lucky Charms magically turn the milk blue . 
today my horoscope told me that I was going to be depressed , but that my depression would be a good thing for me ...... great . 
\I never did get to sample the delights of your flavor \"." 
I got to be Rouge from X-Men today . Childhood wish complete . 
Missed me , missed me , now you've got to kiss me . If you kiss me mister I might tell my sister . If I tell her mister , she might tell my mother , and my mother , mister , just might tell my father , and my father , mister , he won't be too happy , and he'll have his lawyer come up from the city and arrest you , mister . So I wouldn't miss me if you get me , mister , see ? 
1 ) Somebody tells you about a really cute video they saw of a baby on YouTube . 2 ) You decide to check it out . 3 ) Its cute and/or hilarious . 4 ) You click on a related video hoping it will be as cute/hilarious as the first . 5 ) It doesn't disappoint . 6 ) You click another . 7 ) You spend the next hour+ watching videos of baby's laughing , crying , and talking ... 8 ) All hope of escaping is lost . 
fallen victim to twitter . Not saying I love it or anything ... but I do have an account . 
why should Valentines Day be any different then loving anyone any other day ? And being lonely shouldn't hurt anymore today then tomorrow , in fact embrace it . 
So earlier this month I was reunited with my childhood Saturday morning cartoon and now , 52 episodes later ( again ) I am right back where I was years ago , terribly depressed that X-Men Evolution got canceled ... 
Its a mental hospital for the criminally insane . 
I'm a carny , I live for games of < PROPMALE > . 
Found my apparent \power song\ " today : Pokemon Theme song . I knew that would come in handy on my Ipod . " 
got 4th place at forensics yesterday . I'm really really going to miss it , and all of the amazing people I have met through forensics .

What's the difference between a < PROPFEMALE > and a writing desk ? 
After missing 1:11 , 2:22 , 3:33 , 4:44 , and 5:55 today by only a few mer minutes ( mostly only by one minute ) I finally managed to catch 11:11 to make a wish . 
What a crazy random happenstance ! 
I'm Dr. Horrible . I've got a PHD in horrible-ness . I just want to be an achiever ... like Bad Horse .... I meant .... Gandhi . 
In fact even I am eatable , but that is called cannibalism , my dear children , and is frowned upon in most civilizations . 
Oh I do love a good party . Will there be heaps of dancing and delightful frivolous diversions ? 
Anyone else find it ironic that the same woman who plays < PROPFEMALE > on Teen Titans , also plays Bubbles from the Powerpuff Girls ? 
Its pi day ... someone alert Mr. J . 
Do you understand the absurdity of the conundrum that you just presented ? 
dear < PROPFIRST > , i harvested your crops and plowed your field . unfortunately i did not make it in time to save your green roses :( i sorry . but on the bright side you got the red ribbon in vegetable virtuoso and level one in wheat . i didnt harvet your tress and i didnt plant anything . :D love- < PROPFEMALE > Bruckner 
If you judge people , you have no time to love them . 
< PROPFEMALE > the Pooh quotes are really deep and really sweet . They know just how to make my soul happy . (: 
Oh , I just had flash backs of < PROPFIRST > Guthrie , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Griggs , < PROPFEMALE > Bruckner , and I sitting in Algebra1 singing Mulan and the sound of music while doing homework . I miss those days . 
We must be swift as a coursing river with all the force of a great typhoon , all the strength of a raging fire , mysterious as the dark side of the < PROPFEMALE > ! 
Nothing like watching Tarzan at 3AM . 
The < PROPMALE > and his men stole the < PROPFEMALE > from her bed and bound her in her bones . The seas be ours and by the powers , where we will we'll roam . 
Ok , so yesterday I was watching The < PROPFEMALE > Diaries on netflix online , but I didn't finish , so I logged back on today to watch the rest ... and guess what ? Netfilx removed it from the instant play list , so now if I want to watch it I have to order it ... I shall plot to destroy thee netflix . 
7 more episodes of lost .... 
I will , I repeat , WILL find a way to the < PROPMALE > Potter amusement park ... 
sooooooooooooooo sleeeeeeeeepyyyyyyyy . 
Dr. Horrible and the Creators of Lost are both on TIME Magazine's Worlds Most Influential People list , and Dr. Horrible is beating Lady Gaga ... yessss ! 
The < PROPMALE > Potter Puppet Pals is on TIME Magazine's YouTube's 50 Best Videos .

But if Frodo hadn't destroyed the ring , then goodness its self , may have died . 
Prepare for trouble . Make it double . To protect the world from devastation . To unite all people within our nation . To denounce the evils of truth and love . To extend our reach to the stars above . < PROPFIRST > . < PROPFIRST > . Team Rocket , blast off at the speed of light . Surrender now or prepare to fight . Meowth , that's right . 
I gave slipped dangerously low in my chair . Yet instead of freeing myself , I am updating my status on facebook so that all of you will know of my misfortune . 
I killed one bird with one bird .... now let's throw a rock into the equation . 
Eating jel-ush-o on my trampoline in my romantic back yard .... not weird at all . 
How do you measure a year in the life ? 
There is an unfair war in my house . My little IPhone speakers playing Seasons of Love vs . my dads home stereo system blasting Jukebox Hero ... and < PROPFEMALE > Dever Gates is sitting there singing We Are The World ... 
Happy Birthday to the little boy who sees dead people . 
School . Ready for friends , not ready for work . 
Anyone else in the horrible predicament of Lost and Glee being on the same night ? 
< PROPFIRST > Mattison Vallery is the best crazy adviser ever . You've just got to keep saying I'm sorry , I'm sorry , I'm sorry , I'm sorry , I'm sorry , I'm sorry , I'm sorry , I'm sorry , I'm sorry , I'm sorry , I'm sorry , I'm sorry , I'm sorry ,.... and so forth , and people will think your INSANE for some reason ! 
I get to stay at home and plot the death of < PROPFEMALE > the Explorer ...... fill her backpack with bricks and throw her into < PROPFEMALE > Cane River . 
Ahhh . Just ah . 
Got the last copy of Toxin . Luck is on my side . 
Oh Asians . 
Science Olympiad without Kajal was like a carnival without happiness ... the carnival is still amazing beyond belief because of the nature of the carnival itself , but it somehow feels empty , like something is missing . 
Well , its been one year since I got a facebook , and a lot has changed . I miss my 71st friends like crazy , I swear you guys are the most amazing people I have ever met , and probably ever will ( with a few exceptions of some of the great new AMAZING people that I have met in high school ) . The memories I have had with you all will never cease to bring a smile to my face . I love you guys and I always will . 
thought her status should change , but wasn't sure what to change it to , so here it goes . 
The recipe for The Veggie Thing is hidden like the Krabby < PROPFEMALE > secret formula ... now I know how Plankton feels . 
BLUEBERRY POMAGRANET CRANBERRY JUICE !!! 
Just took a trip down memory < PROPFIRST > , I wish I could have stayed but I had to come back to reality . 
< PROPFIRST > Griffin is my current hero for letting me know that I dont have to do my civics outlines tonight , thank you ! ( ps : so remember vote < PROPFIRST > Griffin and < PROPFIRST > Long for Sophomore Class Representatives ) 
Why , oh why , dear spark-notes/cliff-notes do you fail me now ?! 
THE NOTEBOOK ! 
Oh , Holmes , how I love thee . 
RIP : My voice . 
Whats up with the freaking long < PROPFEMALE > titles ? Oh , and I flipping love Google , always have , always will . 
Sometimes I know things without knowing how I know them . 
There is possibility that it will rain all week ... Heaven . 
LOST ! 
< PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > are finally reunited !!! 
I love < PROPFIRST > Locke ! Not the Man In Black in < PROPFIRST > s body , but the real < PROPFIRST > Lock who smiles with an orange peel in his mouth at a time of sorrow to cheer up a little boy on the beach with his dog . 
HURLEY !! 
WHAT ?! 
Lost . 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY < PROPFEMALE > Bruckner !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \ 
\ 
United we stand ! Now and forever ! In truth , divided we fall ! Hand upon hand ! Brother to brother ! No one shall be greater than all ! \ 
I LOVE YOU MY CARNI ! I HOPE YOUR BIRTHDAY IS SUPER SPECTACULAR , AND FULL OF MAGIC . \ 
I'm hoping that dedicating my status to you might make up for not being on for the first to write on your wall . Love you , happy birthday ! 
Dont worry Peeta , I will love you forever , even if Katniss wont ! 
I'm such a nerd . I'm going to miss school . 
GUESS WHO WON PANDEMIC2 ?!?! NOT < PROPFEMALE > Erickson , NOT < PROPFIRST > Mattox , AND NOT < PROPFIRST > DuBois ! Haha but I did ... and < PROPFIRST > Long , but my score was higher .... just saying . Haha 
So I was re-watching the Lady Gaga Glee episode beginning , with the whole Twilight tease , and I realized that the so called \twilight freaks\ " were all dressed like vampires ... yet one of them was wearing a Team < PROPMALE > shirt . This is totally unethical . Haha " 
Had the most amazing day . 
Hates falling asleep . 
I dont think its hit me that school is out yet . 
Please phone . Finish syncing . 
Just had a momentary freak out over the realization of how close Eclipse is ... I'm a dork . 
I'm watching Enchanted , a bit too excitedly actually , and every time I do , I think of < PROPFIRST > Patterson saying , \OH GISELLE ! \"" 
Anyone want me to edit a photo of them , perhaps , I'm in an editing mood , but I dont know what to work with . 
I have a feeling that if the world ever is dominated , chances are in my favor that I will have some part of it in one way or another , whether its me , or one of my friends . 
Eclipse with < PROPFIRST > . 
Who is actually still in town ? 
* pisst pissssst * < PROPFEMALE > Dever Gates and < PROPFEMALE > Martin .... please shhhhhhhhhhhh . 
Its been 3 hours and the little bar stating the completion of the update on my phone has literally only moved like 1/16th of the way ... its going to be a long night . 
Ohh gosh , small world moments . I love them . 
I managed to recognize about 4 people from forensics downtown today , had a lot of fun there reuniting with friends . 
I hate it when somebody tells you to text them , when they are obviously capable of texting you themselves . \ 
Yes , you ( the you that knows its him ) , I love you , but this needed to be vented . 
Is there ANYONE out there who can give me hope that The Last Airbender won't suck for me ? 
Last night I had a dream that can only be described as .. a mix of < PROPFEMALE > Land ( the board game ) , Narnia , Chess , the Bible , < PROPMALE > Potter ( mostly the first ) , Dungens and Dragons ( yes .. the board game ) , possibly a little Twilight ( Eclipse ) , The Nightmare Before Christmas , and yet facebook was in the dream .... it was very ... interesting to say the least . 
WHOOOH ! We are 10th in the country for adult obesity rates ! 
Predictable doesn't always mean boring . Lust doesn't always mean love . Near doesn't always mean close . New doesn't always mean exciting . Different doesn't always mean better . Far doesn't always mean distant . Knowing everything doesn't make you wise . Knowing the truth doesn't make you superior . Knowing your problem doesn't solve it and sitting between your past and your future , doesn't mean you're in the present . 
just realized that the supposed release date for Breaking < PROPFEMALE > Part 1 is November 18th , and that the release date for the Deathly Hallows is November 19th , and I will not , I repeat , will not , miss either of those midnight showings . Best . Week . Ever . 
I remember when < PROPFIRST > was < PROPMALE > from < PROPMALE > Potter , < PROPFEMALE > was the sister from Zathura , and < PROPMALE > was Sharkboy ( or the cute kid form the Frosted Flakes commercial to < PROPFIRST > Patterson ) . 
World cup .... or < PROPMALE > Potter ..... 
Serves all you , non-octopus believers , right ! 
\Wow . That dude looks just like < PROPFIRST > Pattinson . \ " - Muggle watching HPGOF " 
I just fell off my bed ... which , in case you didn't know is a top bunk , and though both of my dogs came to comfort me on the ground , neither of my brothers even stopped watching their movie . 
I'm fine with looking at blood , gore , burns , battle wounds , and even cannibalism in movies , yet , I can not handle clean cut incisions . How that makes any sense , I know not , and why , in that case , am I watching Nip/Tuck leaves me clueless . 
This is seriously a problem . I'm trying to watch < PROPFEMALE > & < PROPFEMALE > , but the people are eating ... and talking .... they are talking while eating .... food is in their mouth while words are forming , and I'm getting to the point where a seemingly innocent movie is about to make me throw my laptop through the window . 
I don't think I've ever been on facebook with absolutely no one online . I feel like the only survivor of a zombie apocalypse and like I am creating my own personal video blog to reflect on in my future years of solitude .... then I realize that it's four in the morning , and everyone else is only doing what was intended for normal function of the human body . Sleeping . 
Don't you love that moment when you find out something absolutely amazing unsuspectingly and you cant help but stop sitting up straight and smile while your heart does a little dance ? Well guess what , Unwind is possibly becoming a movie . 
Whenever I hear anyone master the prelude from Bach's Cello Suite no . 1 , it genuinely makes my heart smile . 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > is talking on the phone with \Samantha\ " and thinks that I don't know and she \ " keeps laughing for some reason\ " ... I wonder too < PROPFEMALE > .... I wonder too .... " 
Watching Sister Act , I miss my grandparents . 
A Very Potter Sequel . I love you StarKidPotter . 
Reality in a town called Utopia . 
I've decided that thanks to 71st and that demonic story , I can no longer look at oatmeal without thinking about it filled with the blood of innocent children ... joy . 
Kajal just left ..... 
< PROPFIRST > Clayman vs . < PROPFEMALE > Briscoe in a Gaga War ..... I will now be taking bets . 
Let the record show that I do love < PROPFIRST > Clayman , even though I may not always show it . 
I need guidance on my schedule-\ 
First Semester : World History , Apparel Devel ., Drafting2 , Chem . \ 
Second Semester : Visual Arts , World History AP , English2 , Algebra2\ 
I've heard that AP World isn't worth it , in fact , I didn't even sign up for it , I wanted AP Psychology . I am also having second thoughts about Visual Arts . I wanted theater , but I apparently can't request it , so I am a little lost . Help ? 
Today I was called heartless by a man selling cookies ... 
I am purging the You know you went to SFCMS when ... < PROPFEMALE > of all things horrid or irrelevant . It will be a long journey , but I hope it will be successful and worth it . 
Am I the only on who really likes the \Above the Influence\ " commercials ? I've come across this conclusion at multiple points in my day today . " 
Dear 1AM , \ 
You are the reason that I have < PROPFEMALE > Girl ( Aqua ) , That's How You Know ( Enchanted ) , Bad Romance , Circle of Life ( The Lion < PROPMALE > ) , and now the theme song for Nip/Tuck on my Ipod . I thank you for the majority of those purchases . 
You'd think killing people might make them like you , but it doesn't . It just makes people dead . 
Im sick of summer and this waiting around . Man , its only August , and I'm skipping this town . Hey its no mystery , theres nothing here for me now . I gotta get back to Hogwarts . I gotta get back to school . 
We got these days of summer to remind us of each other . The time we have to spend apart will keep us in each others hearts . I'm hoping that the good old days are something that I will dream about at night . Don't matter if it's soon or later , I know that it's gonna be alright . 
< PROPFEMALE > Erickson feels like she is stealing dreams by taking coins out of a fountain . 
My power is being bipolar . 
If you are reading this , then it is not your birthday . 
I just stole a spiders life ... 
I just realized that in Shrek2 when Shrek wakes up to the 3 girls after taking the potion one of the girls tells him that she \fetched a pail of water\ " ... her name is < PROPFEMALE >." 
If anyone wants to go to Barnes and < PROPMALE > at midnight tonight and pick me up a copy of Mockingjay by < PROPFEMALE > Collins , I would love you forever . 
If only I could go without sleep . 
< PROPFIRST > Pan Syndrome ... the symptoms are kicking in again . 
Hmmm ... I wonder where I put my schedule . 
I gotta get back to Hogwarts , I gotta get back to school . Gotta get myself to Hogwarts , where everybody knows I'm cool . \ 
Back to wizards and witches , and magical beast . To goblins and ghosts and to magical feasts . It's all that I love , and it's all that I need . HOGWARTS , HOGWARTS , I think I''m going back . 
We talked about cooties in psychology today . 
Sometimes I just want to copy someone else's status , word for word , and see if they notice . 
Facebook just informed me that I am attending Hogwarts on Wednesday . This was a pleasant surprise . 
Can . Not . Wait . To finally sit down and read Mockingjay . Thank you < PROPFIRST > Griffin ! 
I have sat here trying to come up with a status that portrays how I feel right now , but I cant do it , so I guess I'm leaving at , The Hunger Games are over . 
I'm sitting beside a rather large spider , whom has given me no motivation to kill it . Why can't all spiders and humans have this truce ? 
I wonder how < PROPFIRST > Mays would feel about his death being used to sell Oxiclean . 
I hate it when I have an absolutely amazing dream , but when I wake up , I can only remember the amazing-ness of it , not the actual details . 
Dont panic . 
How did people function before Google ? 
All the ancient classic < PROPFEMALE > tales have always been scary and dark . - < PROPFEMALE > Bonham < PROPMALE > . 
I love Tate Meyer and her amazing smile for the yearbook . Haha 
I just watched the SFCMS Documentary . Gosh , I miss that school . 
If I tag < PROPFIRST > Clayman in a status , then apparently he feels as though he must comment . 
< PROPFIRST > is better than me 
I have a friend request from < PROPFIRST > Gates ... should I be concerned ? 
Had a bunch of fun at Barnes and < PROPMALE > . Ran into a few nerds . 
< PROPMALE > Criss is going to be on Glee . I think my heart just exploded . 
Bahaha , I am having way too much fun with this . You can type your password out as a post or comment and it will come up as stars when you share it ! Haha ******* Hahaha ... I'm such a 6 year old . 
New Goal : Read every one of the Average Wizard posts , starting on < PROPFEMALE > 830 . 
Sometimes I feel like a facebook stalker because I realize that I know pretty much everything that anyone puts on facebook . Then I remember that it was you that put it there . I'm only fulfilling your expectations by acknowledging it . 
does this work for you dear ? 
< PROPFEMALE > Lovegood was right , the things we lose , really do , have a way of coming back to us in the end . 
Never stop dreaming , because if you stop dreaming , you're just sleeping . 
I love being able to walk into a Zombie Apocalypse . 
has been hacked by < PROPFEMALE > Erickson (: 
Anyone have a parent who wants to take me to New York next month ? 
It's Halloween and I am not in a costume . I want to cry . 
Now instead of seeing two people's wall posts , you can see their \friendships\ " .... staking is going to be a lot easier now . " 
So , I'm considering doing Miss FTS for the sole reason to wear combat boots with a dress . Any other ideas for possible epic un-pageant things I could also do ? 
So .... I'm on my computer , and I actually have quite a few windows open and randomly the opening song from A Very Potter Musical just started playing . I have no idea where it is coming from , but I am not complaining . 
OFF TO THE QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP ! 
Muggle Quidditch World Cup 2010 
Go Harvard Horntales ! 
I will never be able to look at brooms the same way again . 
Has everyone ran out of enough creativity to come up with their own facebook status' ? Boredom is not an excuse . 
PLEASE put this on your status if you know someone who has been eaten by a dragon . Dragons are nearly unstoppable and , in case you didn't know , they can breathe fire . 93% of people won't copy and paste this , because they have already been eaten by a dragon . 6% of people are sitting in the shower armed with fire extinguishers , and the remaining 1% are awesome and will repost this . 
So , I'm going to watch Lost again . 
I love how < PROPMALE > Potter can connect random people . A perfect example would be the Quidditch World Cup , where I could be walking blocks away from the field and pass someone who was also wearing a Gryffindor scarf and we would have a moment of excitement in the middle of the street . 
IS THIS MORE EXCITING ?! OR DOES IT JUST SEEM LIKE I'M WEIRD ?!! 
Please come back to life tumblr . 
So , now the latest ' status trend ' is to put a NUMBER down to ( for the most part ) be lied to ? \Oh what a significant difference \"." 
I will demolish you all in snake ... just wait ... 
just typed in gibberish to save a photo , and it somehow matched with past gibberish that I had typed for another photo ... I had to re-gibber . 
Anyone involved with the theatre who is free tonight at 6 and wants to work spot ? Hmm ? Haha 
It seems like every other status is about hatred for Study Island ... I thought I was done with that once I left 71st .... I was wrong .... so wrong .... 
< PROPFIRST > Long and I got 2nd place at Forensics today . We were pretty amazing if I say so myself . 
had a great weekend . Sometimes selling my soul to the theatre pays off . 
All of these Day Challenges ? Yeah , that's a Tumblr thing , and a majority of you will not finish them . 
Like this status , if , and only if , you are completely done with your share .
