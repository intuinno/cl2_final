This\ 
week we remember all babies born sleeping or whom we have carried but \ 
never met , or those we have held but could not take home or the ones \ 
that came home but didn't stay . Make this your profile status if you or \ 
someone you know has suffered the loss of a baby . The majority won't do \ 
it because , baby loss is still a taboo subject . Break the silence . In \ 
memory of all angels !
