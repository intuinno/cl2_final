And I am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from God's love . Neither death nor life , neither angels nor demons , neither our fears for today nor our worries about tomorrow—not even the powers of hell can separate us from God's love . ~ Romans 8:38 , NLT --- I get a daily bible verse sent to me daily from K-love and this is todays .
