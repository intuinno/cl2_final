A slush drink , @ 120 < PROPMALE > per hour ( 2 cars @ 60mph going towards eachother ) will kill you , but if your behind a car windshield , it will only cause the windshield to be impossible to see through and most likely cause a massive accident , oh , and if the widshield was installed right , u'll prolly be covered in sticky cold slushi
