You promised me Heaven , then put me through Hell .

is loving < PROPFEMALE > ? 
' s life really sucks right now . It's not even funny anymore .

just took a bunch of quizzes and listened to the same song 7 times in a row . I need a life ...

Ramadan starts tomorrow ! Then < PROPFEMALE > gets back . Ah , something to look forward to at last :D 
Headache .... 
I would hide behind < PROPFIRST > at the orientation but that wouldn't work out too well . So I'll hide behind < PROPFIRST > ;) 
The orientation was a waste of time . :\\ 
I knew we should've skipped to September in July >.< 
September 3rd : the beginning of the end 
fell asleep in Studio < PROPMALE > . * yawn * 
2 down , 178 to go ... 
is wanting to be in 7th grade again . 
can't go to Homecoming . :D 
This has all gone much too far . 
When a guy sweep you off your feet , he's in the perfect position to drop you on your ass . 
As long it isn't Class Night , Homecoming can't be that bad ... Right ? 
If I lose my ticket , maybe they can't let me into the dance ... 
I went to Homecoming . Happy now ? xP 
is feeling sooo much better . I guess things get worse before they get better . 
Life is good . :) 
I lied . Dx 
' s intense dislike for irony is quickly nearing hate .

When your best friend turns into a < PROPFEMALE > , you know you overestimated your generation . 
should've moved to Pakistan when she had the < PROPMALE > . 
is pondering things better left unthought . 
Perhaps the most lovely gift of memory is the ability to forget . 
Lies , lies , lies , all lies ! :\\ 
Lock the door with no key and you will never be hurt . 
If truth is a lie , then are lies the truth ? 
Letting go ... Cliche though it may seem , it is sound advice . 
Who are we to attach words to emotions ? They are only feelings , after all . How do you describe happy ? Or guilty ? Or bad ? How do you feel sincerity ? Or love ? 
How do you possibly consider someone a friend when you cannot feel for them ? 
New conclusion : Friends are fine , kept at arm's length ...? 
Masquerade , hide your face so the world can never find you ... 
It's a type of giddiness edging on hysteria when you cannot mourn what you have lost . 
But then , it is relief you feel when there is nothing lost to mourn . 
Why would one be confused about something one understands quite well ? 
Never enough , never enough . 
House episode was intense . Poor < PROPMALE > :( 
You ask for more than I can give and take all I have to offer . But there is nothing that I would deny you , if it is within my power to < PROPMALE > . So take care what you ask of me , ' cause I can't say no . 
Have you ever gotten the feeling that no matter how much you are wronged , no matter how much you bleed , you would still forgive the person who hurt you ? 
Innocence is ignorance . Ignorance is bliss . 
? The Phantom of the Opera ? 
Fear is only in our minds but it's taking over all the time . 
All I want is freedom . A world with no more night and you always beside me , to hold me and to hide me . Say you love me every [ baby making ] moment ... 
It is very upsetting to hear Christmas songs on the radio already . It's still Thanksgiving . :( 
Eid mubarak ! :) 
Love lives forever , you say ? Well , who dares to love forever ? Who waits forever anyway ? 
Upon my end shall I begin - forsaking all I've fallen for I rise to meet my end . 
is sooo screwed for that bio test . =( 
Don't pretend to know me when I don't even know myself . xP 
Ooo , a < PROPMALE > episode . :D Poor guy doesn't get enough attention ... 
Aww , saddest Criminal Minds episode ever T_T 
Not a good day . To start with , this is the third status I've posted today . 
The funniest thing about betrayal is that you deny ever thinking , \It could never happen to me ... \"" 
You feel stupid for feeling stupid , then unreasonable for feelings stupid , then stupid for being unreasonable . Cure ? 
If you love me , then let go of me . I won't be held down by who I used to be . 
Snow :) 
By the logic that it is foolish to trust , only fools have friends . I pray you consider me a fool . 
Perhaps a little more wise . Still a fool , but at least a wise fool . 
It's three in the morning and I'm not tired yet ... I know I will suffer for this on Monday . 
How do I get myself into these things ? 
Cravings for bad music cannot be healthy . 
We've reached the dizzying heights of that dreamed-of world . 
Facebook makes stalking wayyy too easy . >.< 
is watching House ... Again . 
is feeling miserable . Great , but miserable . 
is home , sick , bored out of her mind and thus stalking various people on Facebook Dx 
has been rather counterproductive today >.< 
is insanely bored and much too dependent on the internet . 
Knowing who you are is much , much more difficult , much more vital , than knowing what you are . 
asdfasdfasdfas Axl < PROPFEMALE > killed Bohemian Rhapsody >.< 
Cherone , at least , did Hammer To Fall justice , and now I'm rambling . 
I think the < PROPFIRST > Mercury Tribute Concert has scarred me for life Dx 
is , for the first time , dreading the return to school . 
Sorrow taxes the mind , leaving the body weakened in its wake . So begins the new year . 
It's cold and snowy . ? 
Shot through the heart and you're to blame , you give love a bad name .

There's snow outside . And I still don't have a coat . 
needs to sleep . 
I had a dream when I was young , a dream of sweet illusion . A glimpse of hope and unity and visions of one seet union . But a cold wind blows and a dark rain falls and in my heart it shows - look what they've done to my dream . 
Where the stars hide , none dare go . Yet if you are not none , I then will follow . 
It's the terror of knowing what this world is about , watching some good friends scream \Let me out ! \"" 
should do the English essay that was due on Friday ... 
JabbaWockeeZ :D 
The more you trust , the closer the dagger inches to your heart . 
Don't worry about bio . The test * was * designed with not-so-brilliant sophomores in mind , remember ? 
just took a 6 hour nap . I guess it's making up for the distinct lack of sleep over the past few months ... 
Logic + God = Fail 
* sigh * Shit happens ... 
Plot hole ... 
is high off Zaineb . And yes , that's how I mean it to sound . ;D 
The greatest risk in life is to risk nothing and regret it all . 
should really be asleep ... Well , there's always global . 
should really be sleeping ... * sigh * I guess there's always global . 
Sometimes you have to let go to see if there was anything worth holding on to . 
Is tomorrow an A or B day ? 
>.< 
You trouble with the affairs of your heart , but do not judge me for dismissal . If love lasts forever , this clearly was not it . You are young , child , and all will be well with time .

Pakistan in April ? I hope so ... 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > you can come out of the closet now ... 
Okay , one : the new FB is starting to get on my nerves . Two : omegle.com, the ultimate solution to boredom ... If you speak the right language , that is ;P 
Don't cling to me , I swear I can't fix you - I'm still in the dark ...

Don't wish , don't start . Wishing only wounds the heart . 
Well , shit , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > was right . >.< 
fell asleep in front of the fire for three hours ... This is not a healthy cycle . 
How can December feel so far away and college so near ? 
And in the end , I'll be what I will be . No loyal friend was ever there for me - We say goodbye , I say you didn't try . These tears you cry have come too late . Take back the lies , the hurt , the blame . And you will weep when you face the end alone - you are lost , you can never go home . 
I want to break free . I want to break free from your lies , you're so self-satisfied and I don't need you . I want to break free . 
What doesn't kill us leaves us to whither away in agony . 
really shouldn't go to school tomorrow . :\\ 
had an anxiety attack today . Haha , what a fail of a day . 
should start her homework soon . 
Ahh , the irony of sucking at your favourite subject ... I feel like I'm regressing to that stage of last December . 
Wow , American Idol sucks even more than usual this year . 
Ugh , high school sucks >.< 
is watching Jab We Met . I just gained a lot of respect for Kareena Kapoor xD 
is missing Pakistan more than usual , heh Dx 
feeling better . I guess staying up until two and watching Indian movies just isn't healthy ... 
Ye < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > ! :-P 
There is no price to pay as one cannot give what has been taken . 
Daylight savings has finally screwed up my precarious schedule . I slept from 8pm-4am . On a school night . >:o 
Do not pity me when I go mad , only envy my escape . 
A little while ago I tripped and fell into a ditch . It's very deep and I've been trying to climb out for a while but every time I get near the top , I fall again . Luckily , I found a shovel , so now I can just dig through to the other side of the world and leave the ditch behind me Dx 
Funny how everyone expects you to move on but never considers they're the one who is holding you back . 
No Pakistan in April :'( 
Bored ... Is anyone up for a debate on the definitions and perceptions of the more vague words in the English language ? Or perhaps the origin of evil ? The perceptions of evil ? The meaning of the word \evil \"?" 
I am sooo done with people . </3 
I hate life . Life isn't fair . I went to vent to somebody about all this crap and unfairness but they're all out having fun and one of my best friends is flirting with the guy I've liked for a year while I'm inside with a disease nobody can identify . So said @Sofiya Semenove and I now return the sentiment .

I feel better now . Mommy fixes everything :D

Whatever happens , I'll leave it all to < PROPMALE > . Another heartache - another failed romance . On and on , does anybody know what we are living for ?

Ellicottville with Sofiya Semenova , < PROPFEMALE > Holla 
There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here , it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable . There is another which states that this has already happened . 
Some days you would rather have had your brain smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped around a large gold brick .

Stupid iTunes . 
I'm strong on the surface , not all the way through , I've never been perfect but neither have you . So if you're asking me I want you to know when my time comes forget the wrong that I've done , help me leave behind some reasons to be missed . 
Homesick ?

There is no greater sorrow than to be mindful of the happy time in misery . 
Heh , sore throat with NYSSMA tomorrow :P 
I think I'd be a cactus who thinks it's a tree and then it realizes it's very alone because of its thorns and starts to wilt but then it meets a hawk who won't eat it but one day the hawk inexplicabely dissapears and the cactus explodes and the remains burn and no one will ever know its story . 
We said we'd all go down together .

Panicking . 
I had a dream when I was young , a dream of sweet illusion . A glimpse of hope and unity and visions of one sweet union . But a cold wind blows and a dark rain falls and in my heart it shows - look what they've done to my dream . 
She calls out to the man on the street , he can see she's been crying . She's got blisters on the soles of her feet ; she can't walk but she's trying . You can tell from the lines on her face , you can see that she's been there . Probably been moved on from every place ' cause she didn't fit in there . Oh , think twice ' cause it's another day for you and me in paradise . 
I'm sleepwalking back again , dragged by the force of some inner tide :P 
I am awed by everything that she is and sometimes the thought of her is enough to pull me from the remains of my shadow and take note of the colors around me . And I notice them to be far brighter than memory allows . And whenever I am with her , I see scars fade and old wounds heal and I am overtaken by the simple will to live . 
< PROPFEMALE > , but history is depressing . 
\Inspire us ... But do not attempt to judge . \"" 
I feel like no one ever told the truth to me about growing up and what a struggle it would be . In my tangled state of mind I've been looking back to find where I went wrong . 
I'm getting to the point where I don't feel the pain and I've had enough - I'm ready for the next time it hits me again . ' Cause I've gotten tough , it doesn't phase me . And now I've made my decision , I might be crazy , it's not as though I don't know that condition . Until I'm through with this blue situation , pass me the wine , it's just a miinor variation .

Dumbo is a really depressing movie =( 
I < PROPFEMALE > my head and I advertise a soul for sale or rent . I have no heart , I'm cold inside , I have no real intent . Save me , save me , save me , I can't face this life alone ... Each night I cry , I still believe the lie - I'll love you ' til I die . 
Can't let it lead me down this time , drown my will to fly . Here in the darkness I know myself . I can't break free until I let it go , let me go . Darling , I forgive you after all - anything is better than to be alone . And in the end I guess I had to fall , always find my place among the ashes . I can't hold on to me , wonder what's wrong with me . 
Now I can't let go of this dream , I can't believe that I feel good enough . It's been such a long time coming , but I feel good . 
Who remembers what the multiple choice section of the bio test was out of ? 
Demanding my response , don't bother breaking the door down . I've found my way out - and you'll never hurt me again .

So tired of the straight line , and everywhere you turn there's vultures and thieves at your back .
