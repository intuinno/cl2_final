wondering if i'm going to drown in the catskills this weekend . 
it was fun walking a friend's dachsund through 11 inches of snow . then again , my legs are more than 1 inch off the ground . 
the good news is it's not fractured . the bad news is 6 weeks of physical therapy on the sprained ankle . guess that beats wearing one of those open-toe medical boots in snow and slush . 
black , of course . like everything else . 
so now that i've gone to physical therapy and gotten a list of exercises i have to do every day , why do i have to go back 2x per week for 6 weeks ? can't i just do the exercises ?
