reality continues to ruin my life 
1918 – The first hostilities in the Finnish Civil War began when White Guards attacked trains carrying a large shipment of weapons from Bolshevist Russia to the Red Guards . 
I began to find myself searching , searching for shelter again and again . 
I don't need to fight to prove I'm right 
don't take your guns to town 
there ain't no way we're giving up forever . It's like saying there won't be a rising sun . 
You think that something's happening And it's bigger than your life But it's only what you're hearing 
' s face is strangely hairless 
And my head told my heart \Let love grow\ " But my heart told my head \ " This time no This time no \"" 
I will hold on hope and I will let you choke on the noose around your neck 
BACON 
And I took you by the hand And we stood tall , And remembered our own land , What we lived for . And there will come a time , you'll see , with no more tears . And love will not break your heart , but dismiss your fears . Get over your hill and see what you find there , With grace in your heart and flowers in your hair . 
turn around , its on the other side 
Are you or have you ever been a Norse god ?
