There's so much sand in my phone that it sounds like a maraca .

Once he warmed up a bit , and after coming to terms myself that < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > would never sound like he did in the 60's , ( he sounds more like an incoherent , growling man-child who's grumpy from missing his afternoon nap now ) , I had a pretty fun time at his concert .

27 years after the earthquake that kills everyone in Southern California , the government will find one man as the lone survivor , < PROPFIRST > Dammron , watching his own movies on a repeated loop in his bomb shelter , laughing silently . 
Thanks for making my night infinitely sadder , TV COMMERCIAL THAT SIMULATES A DOG DROWNING . May your makers rest unreasy as night terrors of unfathomable horrors unfold upon their sleeping subconsciouses and haunt them even during the waking hours of their godforsaken week . 
Why did you listen to that man ? That man's a balloon ! Fake a heart attack , you gotta get back to me
