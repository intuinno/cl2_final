While being a NYC blizzard hostage this week I went to see the movie ' The < PROPMALE>'s Speech ' again . It really is that good and I can't really think of a better inspirational starter for the New Year . Truly exceptional !! 

Alabama crushes Michigan State 49-7 ... all is well in the universe and as it should be . :) 
One more time around the block on a two year contract . 60% , sweet ! Thank you to everybody for the support and the extra efforts that made it all possible . 
One of the most unique and powerful aspects of Americanism is that we express our political differences at the ballot and not with the ammunition box . 
Coming this March will be a Congressional vote to raise the Federal debt limit even higher . The proposed Obama budget will double the federal budget deficits from $10 trillion to $21 trillion over the next 8 years . By 2016 interest payments on the federal debt will exceed all military spending . Thinking ' train wreck ' at this point . 
Apparently the sky is falling . Talked to family in Alabama after the tornados ... the NWS issued warnings to stay inside after the twisters moved on since debris is falling out of the sky up to 100 < PROPMALE > away . Guest that house that landed on the wicked witch of the east in Oz isn't so far fetched after all . 
Bin Laden - So shall ye sow , so shall ye reap . Bad < PROPFEMALE > is a real bitch .
