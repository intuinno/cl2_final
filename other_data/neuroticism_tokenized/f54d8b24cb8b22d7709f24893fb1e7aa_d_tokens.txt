like my status and i won't tell you a damn thing =D 
If you are reading this i dont care if we've spoken once or 100 times post a \ 
comment of the FIRST memory you have of me that pops into your head . When \ 
you've finished post this as your own status you'll be surprised what people \ 
remember about you . 
When is the next plane out of here ?

Do you ever look at a random person's profile and suddenly get struck with the stench of douche ? 
It's Facebook , not real life . 
I think I got about 50 happy birthdays on here so rather than try to thank all of you individually , I'm sending out one big collective thanks =]

Nothing says thanksgiving like 34 wild turkies in the backyard . 
What if I don't want to upgrade to the new profile ? I just figured out the first one 
Random self-centered generic posting about a ) what mundane activities I am not looking forward to participating in . b ) a complaint or grievance about an unnamed villain who has irked me . c ) meaningless song lyrics . d ) potpourri . 
Somebody post something stupid for me to mock and ridicule .
