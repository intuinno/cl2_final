Sometimes no matter how much you want someone , no matter how much you love them , no matter how desperate you are for them ... sometimes you just can't have them . </3 
We were given : Two hands to hold . To legs to walk . Two eyes to see . Two ears to listen . But why only one heart ? Because the other was given to someone else . For us to find . 
I took down my walls for you , I gave you everything i had to offer . I loved you and thought you loved me , but in the end it was all just one big LIE . I hope your happy now . 
game in about 2 hours .... yaaaaaaaaaaaaaay ! \

I miss the old times when the only drama was if your crayons were stolen , getting high was on the swings , and the only thing you can get from boys were the cooties . :) 
Did you ever think the reason I'm saying much is because when you’re on my mind you have me looking for words ... yeah I'm falling for you :) 
Even after all the shit you put me through I'm still here to care for you . :) I want to forget and let go , but somehow it’s not possible . :( 
Inspire me . Motivate me . Pull me out of this hole I seem to have dug for myself . It’s not how many tears i cry that measure my pain , but the amount i hold back . <3 
How ironic would it be if someone choked on a life saver ?

i keep a postcard in the back of my mind , white sand , sunshine , & you shining like a brand new dime .. yeah you make me feel like summertime 
nobody knows me im cold , walk down this road all alone , its no ones fault but my own , its the path ive chosen to go 
Have you ever wanted to talk , but never really dared ? Or missed that opportunity to tell them you really cared ? Pretended that it doesn't hurt , and said it's ok ? And spent all day wishing itd all go away ? Acted how your \supposed\ " to so no one knew you cried : And never let them know how you really felt inside ? " 
championship game tonight . <3 then its all over :( 
Time only heals when it wants to , I guess that's why I just can't get you off of my mind , Yeah , when the walls come down between us , Will you be on the other side ?, If you say you didn't mean it , I will let you right back in for the rest of my life 
Life is too short ! So : KISS slowly , LAUGH insanely , LOVE truly and FORGIVE quickly 
And I'll take off my halo , if you take off your wings , You don't have to be invincible , cause I sure ain't no saint , You'll always be my angel no matter what you do , Cause you take me to heaven , just by being you . <3 
this is not working the way i planned . ugggggggh </3

You’re better than the best I’m lucky just to linger in your light Cooler than the flipside of my pillow , that’s right Completely unaware Nothin’ can compare to where you send me Lets me know that it’s okay , yeah it’s okay And the moments when my good times start to fade ... oh you make me smileee (: 
I wish I could tell you how many times a day I think of you and I wish I could think that you'd ever care . 
practice all week nine to noon again .... ohhhhhhh volleyball !!! <3 
I'm nothing fancy I'm nothing special that's true But I know what your thinkin ' Cuz I'm thinkin ' that same thing too Now you'd like everything to go your way And I should probably say everything you'd like me to say But that's not me and baby that just wouldn't be you You better watch how long you wait Cuz baby you might wait too long 
addicted . great just another thing that will end in a disappointment . AWESOME ! :/ i just wish something would go my way for once . 
i told you that i liked you and you were cool with it . why are you ignoring me ? i thought you were different , someone i can depend on for anything , i guess i was wrong again . well now i am thinking that was a bad decision . so if you want me in your life i will be here but until then it was nice getting to know who i THOUGHT you were . bye , until you actually speak to me . 
tired of your games . make a decision and stick with it . your either my friend or not . its plain and simple . i would like to know because i don't wanna waste my time to find out you never cared in the first place . MAKE A DECISION ALREADY ! 
has a low tolerance for all this ! super angry ... 
thought she knew what she was thinking but is now thinking other thoughts and doesn't know what to think of these thoughts . 
i am done !! can't take it anymore . i would try but you don't care . w/e makes you happy i guess . and apparently it makes you happy to see me like this . w/e i am completely done trying . </3 
basketball or bowling ? \ 
comment !! i need help ! 
why do i have to love so many sports that all happen at the same time ?? uggggggggh :/ , still don't know what i am doing . such a hard decision !! 
lol i'm watching phineas and ferb : summer belongs to you !! <3 lmao this is my favorite song from it Rubber bands , rubber balls Made with super-special density Rubber bands , rubber balls They can bounce with such intensity This is the room where we test the stretching This is the room where we test the bounce , ha <3 
On every < PROPFEMALE > you will know how much I love you In every line you will see how much I care With every word well grow a little closer Even though we both know I can't be there That's why I'm writing it down down down down down Ohhhhhhhh I'm writing it down For you and for me And for the whole wide world to read Ohhhhhhhh I'm writing it down 
midland tomorrow for a loons game !!! <3 can't wait ! want to get you off my mind , you have been wierd lately . w/e go ahead and talk about me to your friends i don't care anymore . </3 (( Put another candle in the wind It’s just another thing that I can't fix Play another game that I can't win But I'm not leaving it like this )) 
if this is the way you are going to make me feel , then i am NOT putting myself through the pain . i always knew you never cared and you just stabbed me in the back , thinking it was so funny . well , how do you feel now , knowing you hurt me as bad as you did ? huh ? 
guess what time it is ? LOONS BASEBALL TIME !! heading to midland in a few !! <3 (( I pray your brakes go out runnin ' down a hill I pray a flowerpot falls from a window sill and knocks you in the head like I'd like too I pray your birthday comes and nobody calls I pray you're flyin ' high when your engine stalls I pray all your dreams never come true Just know wherever you are < PROPFEMALE > , I pray for you )) :) 
You feel like a candle in a hurricane Just like a picture with a broken frame Alone and helpless like you've lost your fight But you'll be alright You'll be alright Cause when push comes to shove You taste what you're made of You might bend , till you break Cause its all you can take On your knees you look up Decide you've had enough You get mad you get strong Wipe your hands shake it off Then you stand Then you stand 
things always go wrong and there is no one to talk to them about :'( ugggggggh ! 
I'm quitting , quitting , quitting , I'm quitting you Like a girl wants her chocolate , yeah , I know that I'll miss you But I'm quitting , quitting , quitting , I'm not kidding I'm kicking you , Cause you're my bad habit and I'm quitting you 
I never wanted the stars I never shot for the < PROPFEMALE > I like them right where they are All I wanted was you So baby just turn away Because I can't face the truth All I'm trying to say Is all I wanted was you 
I got your back you got mine , i'll help you out anytime . To see you hurt to see you cry , makes me weep and wanna die . And if you agree to never fight , it wouldn't matter who's wrong or right . If a broken heart needs a mend , i'll be right there to the end . If your cheeks are wet from drops of tears , don't you worry let go of your fears . Hand in hand love is sent , we'll be friends till the end . :) 
no practice tomorrow ... scrimmage at 5 and then tourneys on friday !! <3 
uggggggggggggh ! no idea what sport i am playing ... basketball or bowling ????.... tough choice !! split between them . i love both of them so much !! ugh ! :( 
the votes are going towards bowling so i think that is my decision !! bowling it is ! :) 
you confuse me boy really bad ! 
uggggggggh ! dying from not talking to you when your online . bothers me that you can't talk ! :( 
okay so now i am pretty certain that giving up basketball for bowling is a pretty good decision . anyone agree ? 
Just to see you smile I’d do anything That you wanted me to And all is said and done I’d never count the cost It’s worth all that’s lost Just to see you smile <3 
In your heart , you know I'm exactly who you know me to be . I've NEVER betrayed your trust . I've ALWAYS been right here ... waiting . I'm NOTHING like the rest . <3 , if you only knew how much you actually mean to me !! 
volleyball in a couple hours and i can't sleep just great :/ wow . 7 will come early . 
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano All I know is I love you too much to walk away though Come inside , pick up your bags off the sidewalk Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk I told you this is my fault 
If I knew what I was doing , I'd be doing it right now . And I would be the best damn poet ; Silver words out of my mouth . My words might not be magic , But they cut straight to the truth . So if you need a lover and a friend , Baby , I'm in . I'm in . 
I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the < PROPFEMALE > And I'm aiming right at you Right at you 250 thousand < PROPMALE > on a clear night in June And I'm aiming right at you Right at you Right at you 
BOWLING !! my final decision and i am sticking with it all four years not playing basketball in highschool ! :D 
I should've known by the way you passed me by There was something in your eyes and it wasn't right I should've walked , but I never had the < PROPMALE > Everything got out of hand , and I let it slide Now I only have myself to blame For falling for your stupid games I wish my life could be the way It was before I saw your face </3 
you're always on my mind but you found someone else so i know we'll never be together , you don't have to even say it , i know how you feel </3 
what 5 words describe me best ?? comment ? 
I can learn to live alone and move on with my life There's a million things that I can do to occupy my time I can wake each morning , I can go about my day I can fumble through my words until I find a few to say But the hardest thing I've had to do since we've been apart Is learning how to deal with all this pain inside my heart 
but nothing i could drink could help me drink you off my mind everywhere i looked , i saw your face and i wonder , and i wonder if there still might be a little space in your heart for me ' cause i'm so cold , i'm so alone and i miss you , babe 
somethings you can't take back though you wish you could some things you can't take back though the glass has been broke an ' the milk has been spilled an ' your love's on the line some things you can't take back 
Don't you hear sincerity , In my voice when I talk , Told you this is my fault , Next time , There wont be a next time , I apologize , Even though I know it's lies , I'm tired of the games 
if i could tell you one thing i guess it would be that i love hearing your voice and that your smile just happens brighten my entire day ....... you make my heart skip beats like a scratched cd <3 
never works the way its supposed too .... sick of it :'( 
tomorrow's going to be a long long day .... vball at 7am till 9am then working all day and then at the bowling alley all night ... joy !! ( you've made me feel like nothing , shattered my heart , destroyed my dreams and crushed my spirit . If that was your intention , then you have succeeded . Happy now ? ) 
you've made me feel like nothing , shattered my heart , destroyed my dreams and crushed my spirit . If that was your intention , then you have succeeded . Happy now ? 
it hurts so much to love you the way i do , and then look at you and realize how much you don't care </3 
heading to lonshots !! <3 
And I'll take off my halo If you take off your wings You don't have to be invincible Cause I sure ain't no saint You'll always be my angel No matter what you do , Cause you take me to heaven just by being you 
you make me smile like the sun fall outta ' bed sing like a bird dizzy in my head spin like a record crazy on sunday night you make me dance like a fool forget how to breathe shine like gold buzz like a < PROPFEMALE > just the thought of you can drive me wild ohhh you make me smileeeee (: 
heading to croswell !! <3 
last day of summer wasn't the funnest day ever ... but talked to some amazing people .... ilyyy <3

put another candle in the wind it’s just another thing that i can't fix play another game that i can't win but i'm not leaving it like this maybe i should find a common ground scratch another problem off my list go ahead and kick me when i'm down but i'm not leaving it like this

if i could tell you one thing i guess it would be that i love hearing your voice and that your smile just happens brighten my entire day ....... you make my heart skip beats like a scratched cd ? 
not going to lie , you are the stupidest faggot i've ever met in my whole entire life . i'm not a creep alright . 
There you go making my heart beat again , Heart beat again , Heart beat again There you go making me feel like a kid Won't you do it and do it one time ? There you go pulling me right back in , Right back in , Right back in And I know oh I'm never letting this go I'm stuck on you Whuto whuto Stuck like glue You and me baby we're stuck like glue Whuto whuto Stuck like glue You and me baby we're stuck like glue <3 
you wear your smile like a summer sky just shining down on me and you i swear your heart is a free bird on a lazy Sunday afternoon i love the way that you're up for anything and never worry ' bout what people say that's right whoa thats right <3 
life’s not the breaths you take the breathing in and out that gets you through the day ain’t what it’s all about ya just might miss the point try’n to win the race life’s not the breaths you take but the moments that take your breath away <3 
homecoming tonight but not going to the game or dance .... i'm going to < PROPFEMALE > at longshots instead . 
what if the person you love with your whole heart and soul really IS just your best friend , nothing more ; is the time spent thinking otherwise completely wasted ? :/ 
errrrg , i really need someone to talk too ... :'( 
The first time I looked into your eyes I knew I would do anything for you ...? 
you said you couldn't stand to see me with a broken heart , so i was just wondering ... did you close your eyes when you broke it ? :'( 
i might hug other guys , i might laugh with other guys , i might even < PROPFEMALE > out with other guys ...... but none of them will ever mean to me as much as you do . <3 
in matters of the heart there is only one real question , do you believe what you want is worth fighting for ? Fight for what you believe in , it will be worth it ! 
The most amazing look you give me is when you are amazed just looking at me . You make me feel so treasured and loved . <3 
I love you , with all my heart . You are more beautiful than the < PROPFEMALE > , more radiant than the sun and more precious than a < PROPFEMALE > . 
no matter what happens , i'll always love you . you've touched my heart and it now belongs to you . eery promise i made to you , i will keep it if it kills me . <3 
everything happens for a reason , and even if you don't understand what's going on now , you'll look back one day and know exactly why it had to happen <3 
I may not have everything I have ever wanted in life , but I have all I will ever need to be happy . And that's YOU ! <3 
the one for you is the one that makes you smile every day even if your in a fight , the one you say i hate you too and take it all back in 3 seconds later <3 
watching michigan v . michigan state game .... MICHIGAN GOING TO WIN !!! <3 
okay so what's up with the michigan cheerleaders on the msu side . lmao . wth ! 
i wanna put you in a song , ohhhhh , well i'd sing about your smile and your pretty blue eyes the way your hair shimmers in the sunlight it'd be so easy i'd just write it from my heart ' cause i gotta tell the world what you mean to me wrap you up in a < PROPFEMALE > so you'll be ... stuck in my head all day ' cause you're already there anyway , yes you are ? 
why should I waste my time on someone that evidently does not want to spend time with me ? 
you never know how strong you are until being strong is the only choice you have ... </3 
PEANUT BUTTER !!!! <3 
I'm still here , near you ... but if I seem distant , remember , YOU pushed me away ... </3 
totally believes that we should always listen to our heart ... because even though it's on our left , it'll always be right ;) 
Two hearts meet in a twist of fate , hoping that it's not too late , to find what they've both been looking for . Each one left wanting more . <3 
you will look up one day and miss me like i miss you and i wont always be willing to give up everything for you and one day you will regret not taking the < PROPMALE > you had . <3 
love is like a butterfly if you < PROPMALE > it you will never catch it , if you leave it alone it will land right on your nose . <3 
You should feel righteous when you buy the same thing as a friend for a better price . 
one universe , nine planets , two hundred four countries , seven continents , eight hundred seven islands , seven seas , and i had the privilege to meet you <3 
truth is ... like this and i will tell you ! 
You can ask me 3 questions * to my inbox * and I will answer truthfully , but I dare you to copy this and see what you get asked ! 
when you love someone , you let them go and trust them , if they really love you , they will come back . <3 
It's amazing how one word from the right person can turn your whole day around and make you feel better in a second ! :) 
Whenever I look down at my hand I smile because I know that someones fingers fit perfectly in the spaces between my fingers ... I love you <3 
Maybe if you can't get someone out of your head , they're supposed to be there and maybe you shouldn't give up on them , because it could turn out to be everything you wanted it to be ! <3 
couldn't even play tonight because my stomach hurts so bad , hope you girls win . go freshman !! WE LOVE OUR GIRLS !! <3 
If you push me away , don't be surprised when you can't pull me back . I don't want to be pushed but you just can't see what your doing to me on the inside . :( 
.... i still believe in this rock & roll & i pray the music gonna save my soul , but till then i still believe , some thing are just meant to be .... 
... says nobody asked for life to deal us with these hands we're dealt we gotta take these cards ourselves and flip em don't expect no help . -Eminem <3 
The only thing in life that is worth waiting for is love . wait for the guy who makes you smile when you are at your saddest . it will be worth it to wait ! <3 
knowing a person like you has made me happy in a million different ways , and if ever i have to let you go i will find a million reasons to make you stay . <3 
Life is like an hour glass . Eventually everything hits the bottom , and there is nothing you can do but wait until someone comes along and turns it around ... <3 
I'm not scared of heights , I'm scared of falling . I'm not scared of swimming , I'm scared of drowning . I'm not scared of loving , I'm scared of getting hurt . <3 
If I saw a shooting < PROPFEMALE > , I wouldn't make a wish , because I already have you & baby you're a wish come true ! <3 
Life can be extremely hard at times , people will lie , and back stab you . but always keep your head up , smile (: and never let them know what hurts you the most . <3 
its hard to wait around for something that you know might not happen but its even harder to give up when you know its everything you ever wanted ... <3 
He isn't my boyfriend , but I love his hugs , his smile , his advice , his kindness , and the times when we laugh together , I guess I fell in love with our friendship . <3 
Letters start with A-B-C , < PROPFIRST > start with 1-2-3 , songs start with do-re-me , but love ... love starts with you and me . <3 
I could be with anyone in the world and be content , but I stay with you because when I'm with you , everything is better than I could have ever hoped for . <3 
says you know you are in love when you see that special someone and they make your heart stop and race at the same time . I love you . <3 <3 <3 
If you wake up in a red room \ 
with no windows and doors , \ 
DON'T panic .. you're just in my \ 
heart !!! <3 
* If I saw a shooting < PROPFEMALE > , I wouldn't make a wish , because I already have you & baby you're a wish come true ! * <3 
Do you even realize that you are my everything that I could never live without you & I love you with all that I am ? I love being in love with my best friend :) 
You're a moment in time that i never want to end , a dream that i don't want to wake up from , and a life that i never want to loose . <3 
If a kiss were a raindrop , I'd send you showers . If hugs were a second , I'd send you hours . If smiles were water , I'd send you the sea . If love was a person I'd send you me . :) <3 
you know you're a redneck when ..... your mother gets ran over by her daughter trying to get ready for supper . :) 
Being with you is like having every single one of my wishes come true . <3 
I wish you could see yourself through my eyes and see and feel the way i do about you ! Maybe then you would understand all the reasons why I LOVE YOU ! <3 
BEST DAY EVERRRR !!! <3 
You don't have to take me to an expensive restaurant , buy me < PROPFEMALE > or presents ... i JUST want to be with you ! Money CANT buy love .., but your heart bought mine <3 
When you think of all the sadness , strength , and pain you had to go through to get where you are , all the smiles , laughs , and love are worth so much more . <3 
I don't know where I stand with you & I don't know what I mean to you .. all I know is every time I think of you .. I just want to be with you . You have my heart !! <3 
WARNING : I'm not perfect . i make mistakes . but if you really love me , then you would love everything about me ... good AND bad ! :) 
I need you more then the < PROPFEMALE > needs the stars , I love you more then fish loves water ! You are mine and I am yours ! I hope that never changes I love you !! <3 
I never expected to fall in love with you like I did now . but I know one thing ...... it's your smile that started it all <3 
with sunshine comes clouds and rain , with true love comes sorrow and pain . But once you have experienced true love , trust me ... you will never be the same <3 
why is facebook being so gay ?? i can't even send a message to _______ !! i want to talk to him soooooooooooooo bad !!! 
If i was to look up into the sky tonight and I was to see a shooting < PROPFEMALE > , I would wish for the only thing that makes me happy , which is you . <3 
click ' LIKE ' if i have everr made you S M I L E :) \ 
then make it your status to see how many people you made smile :) 
pulse youth group was epicly awesome !! lol . and had lots of fun playing basketball with Will Affholter Tyessa Brown and < PROPMALE > Sutton !! haha good times :) 
I wanna hear something you've never told me a confession a secret or the best memory with me and don't hold back . :) 
I always knew you would mean something to me , but I never knew you would mean everything to me <3 
why does everything always have to go wrong ??? HATE THIS RIGHT NOW :'( 
It's the most simple & smallest things in life that make you realize what true happiness is & what really matters in life !! <3 
has found someone who can make me smile all day without even trying , can make me blush in an instant by saying something cute , & can turn nightmares into dreams <3 
I found out why opposites attract when I met you . It's because everything I'm not , you are , and the pieces fit together perfectly . <3 
heading out !!! opening day <3 
And I’ll take off my halo , if you take off your wings You don’t have to be invincible cause I sure ain’t no saint You’ll always be my angel no matter what you do Cause you take me to heaven just by being you . <3 
I slip , I trip , I stumble , I fall and normally I don't mind at all but now I don't know what to do because I slipped and tripped and fell in love with you <3 
A picture is a memory you hold in your hand that will fade with time , a memory is a picture you hold in your heart & can treasure for the rest of your life ! <3 
bowling tryouts tomorrow and thursday <3 \ 
don't know how that's going to go . :/ 
wow , that's all i can say . not impressed with my bowling today :( 
You may not be perfect but that doesn't mean your not perfect for me <3 
Everyday I'm learning more about who I am . I am seeing myself and others in a new light and today I have decided I will not settle for less than I deserve <3 
school then bowling <3 
oh wow , got a lot to do today . :/ 
finally has that one guy who always manages to make her smile , laugh and excited for what the future holds ;) 
Sometimes when you're in love with someone , you have to forgive them for all the weird and idiotic mistakes they make <3 
homework time :/ 
Your looks caught my eye , your smile made my heart skip a beat , your hugs gave me butterflies . But you loving me ? there are no words for my happiness (: Je t'aime<3 
... my best friend is a guy . because they wont date your exs and they telll you exactly what they think . but the problem is ... its hard not to fall for them ;) 
No one is perfect , yet , when I look at you , all I see is pure perfection , I guess love is really blind ... <3 
Friendship is not about how often or how long you see each other . It's about being there , without being asked and having the much needed words for each other ... <3 
When you're in love with someone , you can't explain the how's and the why's to people , it's one of those when you know , you just know kinda things , and that's it for me ! <3 
Do I like the lonely feeling ? \ 
The aching pain no one can fix , \ 
along with not knowing\ 
how to help it without eating a Twix . \ 
This is killing me because it's hard to swallow\ 
and an undying lack of help . \ 
I wish I could follow\ 
someone's footsteps and yelp\ 
because I have no one to turn too\ 
in this world of fear . \ 
I feel so blue\ 
but no one will hear \ 
me scream\ 
because it's all just a dream . \ 
-amandaaaaaa ! 
i don't know where i stand with you , i really don't know what i mean to you ,.. all i know is that every time i think of you all i wanna do is be with you ! <3 
wowwww :'( 
I've been gone for weeks , I ain't slept in days I can't find myself in this self-made maze it's been so long since I've been fine I'm just trying to see the bottom of this bottle of wine and I know I'll see better days well I know you'll see things my way ... 
baby , i like it <3 
I am MYSELF and who I want to be . I am NOT what others want me to be or what some people see . I may not be perfect for you , but at the moment I am ME ! :) 
ugggggggggh :'( 
another boring day ... 
Like this and i will tell you \why wats up\ " :) " 
\ ... you ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with them you meet and neither one of you even know what hit ' em got that warm fuzzy feeling yeah them chills used to get ' em now you're getting fucking sick of looking at ' em ... \"" 
you can always hold back the tears and keep yourself sane- until someone asks if you're okay , that is . :'( 
is trying to be strong right now , but it's not the easiest thing in the world . I hate this feeling and want it to just be the way it used to be . I miss it . :/ 
I put a smile on my face when I'm really falling apart on the inside . I say I'm fine when I'm really saying . No , I'm not . I'm just a really good liar . :( 
I've got a head full of stress , a heart full of pain , a hand full of anger found in my chest . Yeah I'm smiling but inside I'm dying ... 
I am who I am . I won't change for anyone . I like the truth and speak the truth . If it bothers you , don't listen . :) 
don't tell me you love me , cuz love's one thing that I cannot do and it's the only thing that I can't give to you ... 
what do you do when everything you ever cared about has been torn away ? :'( 
It's not a matter of how much more I can take , I've had all that i can take ... Now its a matter of how much more i will put up with . :( 
How come I am always the one to lend a shoulder to cry on , an ear to listen and a pair of arms to hug someone when they're sad , but no one ever does it for me ? 
bowled my highest game today :D it felt good . and to think i wasn't going to go bowling until someone asked me :) <3 
i was using stars to name how many things i love about you , then i ran outta stars <3 
i love your voice and the way we talk , your smile makes me smile , and your hugs make me feel like i am flying , when we touch it feels like these no tomorrow ! <3 
love is about taking chances and sometimes losing things but if it's right you'll end up with more than you started with . 
Life is like BASEBALL ; sometimes we strike out , once in a while we steal a base and in a rare moment we hit a grand slam ! it's how we play the game that counts 
I love your hair , i love your style , i love the way you make me smile , what can i say ? you're one of a kind , and 24/7 , you're on my mind :) 
i want to be the girl u laugh with , the one you cry with , the one that's always there for you , the one who cares , i want to be yours <3 
You think I love you , you think I'm crazy about you , you think I want to kiss you , weellllllll , i like the way you think ;) <3 
i was using stars to name how many things i love about you , then i ran outta stars ? 
NO SCHOOL TOMORROW <3 :) 
I have to keep trying with you , because the truth is , whenever I see you smile , it makes me forget whatever I'm saying and whatever I'm thinking . <3 
if it looks good , you'll see it , if it sounds good , you'll hear it , if its marketed right , you'll buy it , but .. if it's real , you'll feel it . 
ohh man , that really ruined my day completely :'( 
Love is like a < PROPFEMALE > . You know that reaching it is impossible but you keep reaching hoping that one day it will fall for you <3 
You make me laugh . You make me cry . You pick me up when I am down . You never judge me . You always love me and I will always do the same for you . :) 
Always remember , I'll always be there to pick you up when you fall ... but if I can't .. then I'll just lie down beside you :) 
my first bowling tourney this weekend . :) this is going to be fun :) 
I have fought a good fight , I have finished my course , I have kept my faith : Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness , which the Lord , the righteous judge , shall give me at that day : And not to me only , but unto all then also that love is appearing . - II < PROPFIRST > 4:7 -8 
you make my heart skip a beat , tie it into my chest , make me loose my breath , make me feel like a kid , and yet when I try to fight it , you do it all over again . <3 
If a < PROPFEMALE > fell each time I thought about you then the < PROPFEMALE > would truly realize what loneliness is really like <3 
You came into my life and you brightened up my world . You drive me insane but I wouldn't want it any other way , I'd rather be crazy if I'd never have met you . <3 
yeah i talk to other guys . yeah i laugh with other guys . yeah i hug other guys . but none of them will ever mean as much to me as you do . 
when you wake up in the morning sometimes you know that it is going to be a good day because you wake up thinking about the person that makes you smile . :) 
A true friend doesn't care when you're broke , what you weigh , if your house is a mess , what you drive , about your past , or if your family is filled with crazy people . Your conversations pick up where they were left off , even if they have been months apart . They love you for who you are . Re-post if you have at least one true friend . They will know who they are !! < PROPFEMALE > Christmas ! 
I could describe you in a thousand words , that would take too long , so I'll use just one ... PERFECT ;) <3 
Please give me , Lord , eyes to see your star ... ears to hear the angels ' glad hosannas ... hands to lay the meager treasures of my life at your feet ... and lips to sing , like a modern-day shepherd , praises to my SAVIOR and < PROPMALE > ! 
And I just can't keep livin ' this way so starting today , I'm breaking out of this cage . I'm standing up , imma face my demons . I'm manning up , imma hold my ground . I've had enough , now I'm so fed up . time to put my life back together right now ! 
I make no excuses for who I am and you either like me for who I am or don't; either way I will be fine . 
A smile shows what is in a persons eyes and eyes are the window to the heart , the heart is the window to the soul , always look before you give your heart away . 
ipod touches are amazing ! <3 
I'm sorry I'm bad , I'm sorry you're blue , I'm sorry about all things I said to you\ 
And I know I can't take it back .... 
1st person to like my status - you can pick my profile picture for 4 hours . 2nd person - your last name will be mine for 1 week . 3rd person - can dare me to do one thing . 4th - I'll say I'm married to you for a week . 5th - I'll write on your wall \I love you\ " 6th person - I will answer a question for you . Put this as your status " 
seriously , could today be any worse ? :( 
realized today that i have no one willing to try and hold me together . i guess i will have to remember that when everyone else is falling apart . </3 
Every day it gets harder and harder to fake that smile . It gets harder and harder to fake that laugh , and it gets harder and harder to hide how I feel from you .. 
maybe i look happy but if you cared enough to take one second to ask then you would know how i really feel and how complicated things have become :'( 
maybe meeting you wasn't accidental , maybe it wasn't a mistake , maybe it was < PROPFEMALE > , maybe it meant something <3 
\Across the oceans and over the skies 
Never say goodbye when you still want to try . \ 
Never give up when you still feel you can take it . \ 
Never say you don't love a person when you can't let go . <3 
Put this as your status and see what color you get (: \ 
Pink : You're cute \ 
Green : You're funny \ 
White : I used to like you </3 \ 
......... Yellow : You're amazing \ 
...... Black : I miss you \ 
Blue : Friends forever ! \ 
Purple : You're hot ;] \ 
Brown : You're sweet \ 
Grey : You're an idiot , but I love you . (: 
It's not that what I'm seeing is not real . It just ain't as real as it seems . -1408 <3 
when I hear your voice I can't stop smiling , when I see your picture I feel the butterflies , and when I'm with you I feel .... well there no word that can express that feeling <3 
a guy and a girl can be best friends but eventually one IS gonna fall in love with the other , maybe too early , maybe too late , or maybe just maybe at the perfect time ( forever) ! <3 
what a great day (: ily ! 
Let's see how creative my face book friends are ... Leave me a 1-word comment that best describes me using the THIRD letter of ** YOUR FIRST ** Name ... It can only be 1 word ... Then copy and paste this to your wall so I can leave a word about you ... Don't just post a word & not copy , that's no fun . 
Sometimes , when you imagine a perfect guy , you realize you've described a person you've known forever . <3 
I'm falling apart , I'm barely breathing , with a broken heart that's still beating . But still your name holds so much meaning . 
judge me\ 
I'll PROVE YOU WRONG\ 
tell me what to do\ 
I'll TELL YOU OFF\ 
screw me over\ 
I'll SCREW YOU TWICE AS BAD\ 
but earn my love and\ 
learn i'm WORTH IT <3 
I'm addicted To the pain , the stress The drama I'm drawn to shit So I guess I'm a mess Cursed and blessed But this time imma Ain't changing my mind I'm climbing out this abyss 
you screaming as I walk out that I'll be missed but when you spoke to people who meant the most to you you left me off your list 
it's amazing how you can mean so much to someone one day , and the next it's like you never even existed to them </3 :'( why ? 
first match went well . :) 
Life would be A LOT easier if people would just say what they mean & mean what they say ! 
If your alone , I'll be your shadow . If you want to cry , I'll be your shoulder . If you want a hug , I'll be your pillow . But anytime you need a friend , I'll just be me . 
I am who I am , I say what I say , I wear what I wear , I do what I do ... if you don't like it then stop pretending to be my friend !! 
One day you're going to wake up and realize how much I really cared , & that will be the same day that I wake up to someone who already knew . 
No apologies , nah suckers I'm not sorry You can all < PROPFEMALE > me , y'all could be the cause of me No apologies , y'all feelin ' the force of me No remorse for me , like there was no recourse for me 
I'd catch a grenade for ya Throw my hand on a blade for ya I'd jump in front of a train for ya You know I'd do anything for ya I would go through all this pain Take a bullet straight through my brain Yes , I would die for you , baby But you won't do the same 
Sweet Girls come from the South , Barbies come from CA , but us Michigan Girls have fire and ice in our blood ! We can drive in the snow , handle the cold , beat the heat , be a < PROPFEMALE > , throw a right hook and drink with the boys ! We can cook a wicked good meal ... and if we have an opinion ... You can bet you're butt you're gonna hear it ! Post if you're a Michigan Girl ! ??? 
Never love if you're not prepared to be hurt , never start if you don't intend to finish , never speak if you don't mean it & never say I love you if you don't feel it . 
-- i thought i knew what love was , and then i met you <3 
I didn't fall in love with you once or twice , but I fall in love every time I see you . 
If I'm not back in five minutes ... Wait longer . - < PROPMALE > Carrey <3 
When ever I am down , you always know how to make me happy . When ever I am sad , you know exactly what to do . I could never love someone as much as I love you <3 
believes with all her heart that life's pitfalls and broken promises were simply my path to YOU . :) 
I wish you could see yourself through my eyes and see and feel the way i do about you ! <3 
You make me laugh . You make me cry . You pick me up when I am down . You never judge me . You always love me and I will always do the same for you . 
okay studing ( check ! ) lmao . i'm soooo tired of studying !! can't wait until this week is over ! :) 
okay so studing for geometry isn't easy ! i'm failing that exam tomorrow , but i think i'm okay with it :) 
The thought of you puts a smile on my face , seeing you makes my heart race . You light up my life like the stars illuminate space . <3 
I am addicted to your smile , your touch , your laugh , Hell , who I am kidding I am addicted to everything about you . <3 
Once in a lifetime you meet a person who takes your breathe away . Not because you want them to , but because they're meant to be <3 
i miss you cupcake :( 
You're the blue to my < PROPFIRST > , you're the sun to my shine , your the apple to my pie . You're my guy ! <3 :) 
There are not enough grains of sand , stars in the sky and drops the water combined to make up for how many times I've thought of you ! <3 
The simplest glance . The sweetest smile . The softest words . These are the thing you do that I will never forget ! You mean the world to me . <3 
Thought I missed you , then I woke up and realized the Earth was still turning . \ 
I guess my world doesn't revolve around you after all . 
And we all shine on , like the < PROPFEMALE > and the Stars and the Sun ... - < PROPFIRST > Lennon 
the hardest thing is to be yourself in a world that is trying it's best , day and night , to make you like everyone else . - e.e. cummings 
wow , i hate my back ! :( 
you're my love , the one i can't live without , the one i think about all the time and can't seem to get you off my mind . <3 
describing how i feel when i'm with you is like trying to describe how water tastes ; completely impossible . :) 
when I am missing you I think of the spaces between my fingers and how your fingers fit perfectly there ... :) 
woo !! i'm happy school's already closed for tomorrow ! :) 
I'm simply on reserve for the one that has my heart . :) <3 
60 days ! <3 
another snow day tomorrow :D 
because you're sweet , goofy , cute , and awesome . :) <3 
Remember when ... Like this and i might tell you :) 
If the wind blows east will you follow me , and if the wind blows north will you stay your course , and if the wind blows west will you second guess , and if it blows south will you count me out ? And if they sun dont shine will you still be mine , and if the sky turns grey will you walk away ? -Kid Rock 
When I am missing you I think of the spaces between my fingers and how your fingers fit perfectly there ... <3 
56 days <3 
i hate not being able to talk . its only been one day and i'm going crazy . uggggh , its going to be a long week :( 
Life's not about finding someone you can live with , it's about finding someone you can't live without ! <3 
lets go steelers ! <3 
53 days !! <3 
love me without fear , trust me without restriction , want me without demand , accept me how I am <3 
I know I mess up a lot but I'm glad to see that you still love me either way and that makes me love you even more <3 
Has anyone ever given you butterflies you can't hold back , smiles you can't resist and hugs you always miss ? <3 
When I meet you , I was scared to like you , when I liked you , I was scared to love you , now I love you , I'm scared to lose you'<3 
You ever love somebody so much You can barely breathe When you're with them You meet And neither one of you Even know what hit ' em Got that warm fuzzy feeling Yeah them chills Used to get ' em Now you're getting fucking sick Of looking at ' em <3 
okay so team bonding was the best ! :D 
Sometimes the footprints someone leaves in your heart are a one way street , and you don't mean nearly as much to them as they do to you . 
I've loved you since the first time I saw you and the feelings just keeps getting stronger . 
If a < PROPFEMALE > fell from the sky for everytime I thought of you , there'd be no < PROPFEMALE > s left :) <3 
I have made a lot of mistakes in my life , a lot i wish i could re-do , but this one turned into a miracle and i would never change us . i love you baby ! <3 
I have my days , I'm moody , I have an attitude , I'm prissy , I'm lazy , I'm cute , I'm fun , I'm awesome , but most importantly , I'm me . <3 
you're the biggest change in my entire life and you're the most wonderful change in my life ... you're everything i've been looking and searching for ... i love you <3 
you give me those butterflies . looking in your eyes , i see someone who loves me for all my flaws . I see the most amazing person to ever come into my life ! 
The greatest thing in life is finding someone who knows all of your mistakes and weaknesses and still finds you completely amazing and will never walk away . <3 
I've learned that , if you truly love someone , your love for that person is greater than any distance big or small .. <3 
mint chocolate chip ice cream = <3 :)

a deeper kinda love has no borderlines no ties a deeper \ 
kinda love can bring you down or lift you up so high a phoenix starts to rise \ 
from the ashes inside my soul ...?

my heart breaks a little every time i think of you . why aren't you with me ? oh yeah that's right , it's because you don't care . </3 .. 
Words are like knives . You may not know it , but you can REALLY hurt someone and you can't take it back . You can only wait for them to heal , if they do . 
softball is slightly kicking my ass right now , but hey , its all about the love of the sport right ? :) ? 
I will stand by you I will help you through when you've done all you can do and you can't cope I will dry your eyes I will fight your fight I will hold you tight and I won't let go ...
