I am completely hyped and happy at the moment :) 
I am completely hyped up and happy at the moment :) 
What do you do when you feel a wound that you can't mend on your own ? You have your friends love you and help you through . But how do you heal when they are the ones who made their own wound on you ? The healing doesn't come for a while-you have to get over two wounds . 1-someone hurt you 2-the ones you trust hurt you and won't help you this time 
I got a B- on my Flexam . I feel a bit of weight lifted off my shoulders :) 
who is excited to have Mrs. Wichers again for honors bio ? 
I have a body of a God ; and that God is Buddha . 
back from a wonderfully lazy trip in Florida 
my sister's 4th Birthday is today ! 
everyone knows that it's the little things that make their day . But what most don't know is you yourself can make your day-just observe and notice the most random things , examine it and laugh at the ideas you conjure from your observations ! 
tried to put some whipped cream on my finger-ended up spraying it all over the table and my dad's face . xP 
She has no Beauty at all , like a Plain Bagel . 
Girl , put your records on , tell me your favourite song\

The recital's over , I had a great time . To putting on tons of makeup you don't wear in public , dancing so hard till you can't breathe .

I officially love and worship Geek Squad . 
People have an image they show . But it's good to shed it off sometimes , because it can open up new things to you . Just the hard part is to shed it off for someone you can trust . 
Dear Sleep , when we were youner we didn't get along so well ; I didn't want to take a nap after lunch , you wanted me to sleep at 8:00 . But now we've gotten older it seems I want you more and more but you seem to want the opposite . So Sleep , let's make up and become good friends , because you're exactly what I need :) 
finally got rid of my old profile picture . \ 
don't like the new one , but everyone's been nagging me .... so here's a new one for all those people . 
in an obnoxious mood\ 
but hey it's okay , we need to have some of those moods :)

Drake : you're so beautiful , I want to marry you . Sonja : I can't . because I don't love you . this is a conversation my 4yr old sister had just now w/her friend at the pool !

Today is a day we all remember for what happend , what we felt when we saw on the news what happend . Let's remember what happend and not let it happen again to anyone no matter who or where they are . 9/11 
Just found out my 12 year old sister < PROPFEMALE > is going to have ( another ) surgery on December 22nd . It's small compared to the previous ones , but I'm scared . Please someone assure me so I can start to calm down inside , while I stay calm on the outside to help Her remain calm and possitive . 
\You've been snorkeled by a freshman . \ " < PROPFEMALE > Kuhne " 
The night I have little homework has to always has to be replaced with something dramatic to fill in the time . I definetly got it . \ 
A family friend's son is lost and might be dead ; please keep this family in your prayers and thoughts . This friend of mine deserves the possitive thoughts . 
The night I have little homework has to always has to be replaced with something dramatic to fill in the time . \

As I got picked up from school today , I found out a family friend's son is lost and might be dead ; please keep this family in your prayers and thoughts . This friend of mine * deserves * the possitive thoughts . 
The son's been found . Dead . RIP < PROPMALE > . God Bless his family with good fortune ahead .

Everytime 
learning my family tree makes me feel awesome . My great-great grandfather was a WWII war hero in Russia . Can I love up to that ? And my Great-grandmother was enslaved in Germany in WWII and lived until her recent death . 
Sick . After making so many percautions to NOT get sick . \ 
Anyone want to tell me what the hw is for whatever classes they have with me ? 
Not sick anymore :) well enough to go back to school-now I have to come to school tommorow and Wednesday @ 6am to make up two tests .... I'm pumped up 
1 of every 10 people born is gay . That means 1 of every 10 people is instantly putdown , given bad labels , left alone , put in a minority , and so much else . All for something they didn't ask for . Many gay teens are committing suicide as a way of escaping . If you want to tell them life will get better , and you respect them for who they are , copy and paste this . Most of you won't , but let's see the 5% who will . 
Children with special needs don't have an illness , so there is no cure and it's not contagious . They want what we all want , to be accepted . Most of you probably won't copy and paste this . Could you do it and leave it on yourstatus for at least 1 hour ? It's Special Education week and this is ... in honor of all the kids ... who need a little extra help and understanding . Help make a difference 
yo amo < PROPFIRST > k mucho mucho mucho . 
is in a heated discussion with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > Slavin that has involved some flex references . 
needs to smile again . I mean really smile-the ones that I used to have on my face every second of the day that made others smile ; rather than a tired zombie look I have on my face now . I've lost my Mashiness and I haven't realized till now and I not only want it but NEED it back . Help me out if you want-I promise a smile will be saved just for you if you care enough to try . 
needs to get her Masha-Smile again . If you try to help me , I promise to save a special smile for you . :) 
Chemistry . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > Blasco : Ok . Sodium , Na . \ 
Me : * Not . Available . *\ 
Both of us : laughing hysterically\ 
Then singing : Pictures of last night ended up online . I'm screwed . Oh well ! Last Friday Night , yeah we dance on tabletops and we took off our shirts-No < PROPFEMALE > it's ' we took too many shots . 
Everyperson has 1000 wishes . A cancer patient only has one : to get better . Iknow that 97% will not post this as their status , but I know that my friends will be one of the 3% and put this as their status , at least foran hour , in honor of those who died because of cancer or are still fighting it . 
people fly into the air in happiness or bliss . But sometimes people get stuck when in complete ignorance . Then you got to try to dig to the ground so you can findout where you stand . 
There's no way I am going to be vegetarian . The Garden Hamburger at school made it final . I'll live by this rule : WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU DON'T EAT MEAT ?!!? That's okay I'll make lamb !! 
feels like a trick is being played on me in school-last week was impossible , this week is bordering to easy and just around the corner finals are about hop out and eat me . 
the trick is starting to be put in action : tomorrow is the Flexam Objective and Partner Chem Test . Can it get anymore confusing besides the Objective being about ANTHROPOLOGY and too many rules and ways on how to write a compound's name ? 
nevermind the trick . I am really annoyed about the final and test . I'm gunna study hard and take these two Tests Down Tommorow . I'm going to do it ; because I said so . Bye :) 
today was Maroon Day for Swimmer's Color Week . \ 
My maroon jacket + myself were pretty hot together . \ 
It's fun to dress up :) 
my doctor is iron man . he's got a defibulator inside him to help his heart after having a recent heart attack he survived . he better stay alive like iron man does . 
everybody in seaholm is either cruising through this time with their easy tri finals ; or they're in complete mass chaous with stress , huge bags from no sleep and their minds turning to goop from their hardest tri . I think my mind is past goop . 
< PROPMALE > Potter 7 part 1 was beyond better than the last two films ! Thank you ! it was great . enough said . 
the day after finals I woke up today @ 7am to take a 5hour test . Now I'm going to see Tangled !!! :D 
Tangled was cute <3 The Animals were the funniest part and each movie keeps making their animations more and more attractively realistic it's freaky ! 
< PROPFEMALE > Uhlenbecker is my current Guardian Angel . Friends bring out the best and endure the worst of themselves . You're my closest friend I've had in a while . I love you too . So much . 
Can we just skip past a few moments we don't like ? Skip through the feelings but still remember them like a stored away memory ? 
Watching Eclipse was entertaining b/c of my 4yr old sister < PROPFEMALE > . In the tent scene this is what she said about Jacob : \Mash 
New Narnia film is such a Flex film ! And a good one too :) 
a half hour outside running and pulling a sister in a sleigh leads to not feeling anypart of your face for a while . I'm gunna go hibernate along with hot chocolate now . 
Mrs. Kidd , I missed the nutrition test today due to the fact that I didn't have enough nutrition within me to take me to school . Which is odd , since I've been listing all of the facts on good nutrition and each vitamin's function since the day you told us when the test would be . Lucky me not having enough vitamin B and C for a few days longer :P 
Flexmas was amazing . I never felt so happy before while celebrating a holiday :) 
< PROPFEMALE > had her surgery today and is home all sleepy and happy . Thank God , and bonus on us bonding together :) 
Sonkie lost her 1st tooth ! 
Preparation for the New Year : going into Physco Cleaner Mode . Always start something new with a clean slate .

And you'll be there ' cause that's what friends are supposed to do 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > made my day today when I found out that she used me as a source for the Student Led Seminar in Flex . 
I want to say something here , but I don't know what . How pathetic eh ? \ 
Hmmmm ... How about : Should I pry for a snowday ? 
Would you rather pry or pray for a snowday ? \ 
Since I'm stupid enough to ' pry ' in my previous status . 
If You want an Epic Ride , then Everything else has to be Epic . The Epic emotions , jokes , alliances , fights and conversations are only included in a deal package with the Epic rewards and failures-those two are the moldings of any person's Epic Ride . \ 
I am so for the Epic Ride in Life . Screw ALL the Epic Failures ganging up on Me right now . 
A Day of Peace . March 4-5th , 2011 . 
End of week two after Winter Break . So tired . It's ridiculous . It feels like it's been two months already , not two weeks . 
\The < PROPMALE > of knowing is knowing what to ignore\ " -Rumi " 
< PROPFEMALE > Uhlenbecker is the cause of my sleep deprivation right now . Of all times , why was it now ? God , please have some possitive destiny/fulfillment from this . Please ? 
Today was not an ordinary day at school for me .

After finally getting rid of Aladdin singing and < PROPFIRST > O'Toole saying \He likes your lemonade . \ " I drank some myself today and am hearing my little sis watch Aladdin . Man I lovvvve what Flex does to my mind . " 
I got to see something most girls in seaholm dream of today in drylands . :) hehe 
Highlight of the Day : Mrs. Wicher still remembers who I am , she said ' Hi Masha!' to me in the hallway . 
Grandmas hold our < PROPFEMALE > hands for just a little while , but our hearts forever . 
Outer space . I hate you right now . Go die in some Black-Hole larger than you are . 
Florida . Alone at last ... I'm in a peaceful place now , away from too many babies on the plane and bitchy car rental clerks . :) 
Highest today : 80 degrees @ 4:00 pm . What to do ? Animal Kingdom !! 
Like this if you want to know something I like about you . \ 
Yes it's the < PROPFEMALE > weather making me do this , just do it . Nothing bad's gunna happen , what's wrong with a compliment given to you ? :) 
Epcot . I talked with Crush the sea turtle and learned from him that guys are cool and girls are hot . Ate at a french restaurant and talked to a tall blue eyed french waitor . :) 
Thanks already to everyone wishing me a good day and birthday ! :))) 
Sweet 16 = success . 
Stuck in the < PROPMALE > Airport . This suckkksss . 
FINALLY home ! \ 
Again : thanks to everyone who wished me a happy birthday :) 
Debate freaked me out : I was unprepared and everyone else ( < PROPFIRST > Em-j Jacobs Winna Wu < PROPFEMALE > Hamilton ) were complete beasts presenting their secretly plotted amazing speeches behind my back . 
You'd think by now that teenagers know the difference between cupcakes and doughnuts . I obviously somehow cheated the system until < PROPFEMALE > Zinkel . 
\Flower gleam and glow\ 
City of Angels 
We've looked at the sky and talked about it and everything else underneath it . I'll miss you and will be afraid to look at the sky again knowing you're still underneath it like me , but not next to me . Please don't go back home . 
I'll be a nonconformist and say that I liked today even though I'm single . \ 
I personally enjoyed seeing some of my friends being all gooeyed up with flowers and dressed in pink today . Happy Cupid Day <3
