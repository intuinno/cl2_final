PLEASE put this on your status if you know someone or are related to someone who has been eaten by dragons . Dragons are nearly unstoppable , and in case you didn't know , they can breathe fire . 93% of people won't copy and paste this , because they have already been eaten by dragons . 6% of people are sitting in the shower , armed with fire extinguishers . The remaining 1% are awesome , and will re-post this . Will you ?

Meaningful relationships with others start with a deeper and more meaningful relationship with God . 
Today I'll stamp the date on a thousand different checks & deposits & every time I'll be reminded of the greatest sacrifice ever known < PROPFIRST > 3:16 
\It's like the sun is shining\ 
\The Greek word for \ " forgive\ " is aphiemi meaning \ " let go free or let escape\ " . Unforgiveness is the means by which we securely bind ourselves to that which we hate most . Therefore the Greek meaning of forgiveness might best be demonstrated as the practice of cutting loose the person roped to your back . \"" 
ready for the weekend already .. my my I despise Mondays . 
\I wish I could describe him to you . He's indescribable . He's incomprehensible . He's invincible . He's irresistible . The heavens can't contain him . Let alone a man explain him . You can't outlive him . And you can't live without him . That's my King . \""
