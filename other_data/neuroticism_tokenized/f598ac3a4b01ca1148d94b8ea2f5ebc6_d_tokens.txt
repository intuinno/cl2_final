Spring break starts monday :) I can not wait ! 
WRT 102 ended up being better then I thought . I am tired and can't wait to get home . Still feeling the food posioning 
What is up with these islanders . I don't even know some of them but they want to add me . The problem is that they are little kids . Frankly I rather not friend little kids especially if I do not know them . Other wise I will look like some creepy loser college student whos only friends are in grade school . Don't talk to strangers kids even if you think having older friends on FB will make you look cool . 
Dyed my hair black today . It was taking to long for the blond to grow out ! It was my first time not going to a salon . Everything turned out fine but guuuuh I don't like how it feels . I hope it will be more soft as it gets washed . At least it is shiny ! :) 
Spooky was hurt yesterday . He went under the recliner to sleep and my roomate sat down and reclined on the recliner when I wasn't home . When I did get home there was some blood under the sofa and Spooky had soiled himself . Long story short I took Spooky to the vet and they didn't find any broken bones or cuts . Blood came from his nose . Spooky was sore though but he is feeling much better now . Poor little guy . 
Went to the 4th Ave street fair today . I can't wait for the Spring Fling ASUA carnival this thursday-sunday . Catcard holders get in for free !
