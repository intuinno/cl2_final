Please post this as your status if someone you knew was killed by Lord Voldemort or any of his followers . As everybody knows , being killed by a killing curse , having your soul sucked out by a dementor , or getting petrified by a basilisk is a truly tragic fate foranyone , muggle or ... wizard . 93% of people won't share this status , for they have already been killed 
Finally got my phone to start charging ! It's been dead all day . @_@ 
... my phone won't charge . FB and e-mail are the only ways I can communicate for now . 
Facebook quizzes are kind of hard not to take when you don't feel like doing anything but mindless clicking . 
My right eye looks like it's been punched ! * sniffle * It hurts every time I blink . =( 
A douche bag tried to steal the 350Z today . 
Black Ops and AC Brotherhood !!! Why RROD ! WHY !!!!! It's been about 2 months since I've even been on Live . I need a new X-box NOW ! T_T 
Midnight showing of < PROPMALE > Potter was awesome .... except for the loud douche-bags who wouldn't shut-up . =P 
I have been phone-less for about a month ... I am so disconnected ... * sniffle *

Happy Thanksgiving Everyone ! I love you all and hope you guys get to eat your favorite dishes today . I'm thankful for having so many awesome people in my life . ^_^ 
I'm getting frostbite ! My hands are freezing . 
Take me to < PROPFIRST > . I hear French fries taste better there . =P 
Change your FB Profile Picture to a Cartoon from your childhood . The goal is to not see a human face on FB until Monday December 6th . Support the fight against Child Abuse by copying and pasting this as your status .

We see what we want but not what we should . 
You sir are a lewd dolt who ventures to persuade others of your genius . And that is why you shall never succeed in life . Good day to you nitwit . ^_^ 
Today is pretty . 
People gotta stop knocking on doors and begging for money . If they want to go to college in the US but are not citizens , they should apply for citizenship , study for the citizenship test , and apply for the fafsa and whatever colleges they want to go to like everyone else . Hassling people door to door isn't gonna get them enough money to buy a book yet alone tuition . Stop bullshitting me .
