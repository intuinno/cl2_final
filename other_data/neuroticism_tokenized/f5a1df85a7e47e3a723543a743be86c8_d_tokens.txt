A < PROPFEMALE > bird that flies away . A candle's fickle flame . To think I held you yesterday , your love was just a game 

I have just received my high school equivalent diploma , I assumed you all might find this interesting . Good day 
Hells yes Soul Silver came in today 
it seems I've come down with some uncurable diease or something or the other , and it ' s such a tragedy and you should start feeling sad now 
I will not forget that I have forgotten 
Some days , I feel like I don't even 
... you're not perfect ... 
the Navy PT utterly destroyed me , I am a pile of sore muscle and sweat 
there's worse things than death in this city ... 
last night , I learned a friend of mine passed away last thursday . she had Lymphoma , and she was only 17 . None of you knew her , I just figured I'd say something to honor her memory . 
Lucid dreaming , slowly getting there 
herf , Navy PT this saturday , so unprepared 
my heart is made of metal 
I will not be told where to stand ! \ 
I will not be told what to say , not by man or machine , \ 
not by you , not by anyone tonight ... 
Usted es mi < PROPFIRST > Querida , te Necesito 
and what can a dead man do ... 
I got this burnin ' like my veins are filled with nothing but gasoline 
Now you are free\ 
\ 
Free to roam in the skies , \ 
Now and then visit me\ 
With your Starlit Eyes ... 
everything's blue in this world , all fuzzy 
Ironman 2 was pretty wonderful , baddling robots spin my gears 
I'm back , for a little while that is 
You have earned the title ' MASTER PROCRASTINATOR'~ 
somebody put me out of my misery 
ISN'T THIS A DREAM COME TRUE ? THIS ISN'T THIS A NIGHTMARE TOO ? 
taking my drivers license test thing today , I think I'll do alright 
man you guys\ 
I can't feel my eyeballs\ 
that is all 
oh yeah , I have a job at another Subway\ 
I'd tell you all personally , but there's too many of you and I'm lazy 
sleep as the sun rises\ 
and wake as it sets

If you're lacking direction in life , just back on your ? feet , loked your\ 
head around at trees and aminals and humens and glowy tower , and then \ 
you'll know what has to be done 
I hate you Tracfone , go die in a pit . \ 
not letting me add minutes online
