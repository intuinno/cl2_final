Thermodynamics is simultaneously reasonably interesting and atrociously boring at the same time . When I read about this stuff , I don't know whether to rejoice at the fact that we figured out something so useful like 200 years ago or fall asleep cause its soooo boring . 353 more slides to go . 
HAHAHA an interesting turn of events has occurred . 
My gpa is going to be so screwed after this term . ugh . 
Whatever , at least I am good at research . Screw you GPA . 
Music , Sapporo , and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > shower gel to top off a whack ass day . I guess it could be much worse . 
So ... Many ... Slides ... OMG 
I now have insulation for my back wall so my pipes don't freeze . Anyone wanna help me install it on tuesday ? 
This thermo test is either going to be super easy or super hard . I sure hope I guessed what he wanted us to memorize . 
Cleaning , Cooking , Quantum , and C-laundry . 
I wish my name was Buckaroo Banzai . 
I bet Khantha will switch up the classic particle in a cube problem with a particle in a hypercube just to throw us off . In which case I will be forced to make references to the really crappy syfy original movie cube 2 : hypercube in retaliation . 
Spiced wafers FTW . 
Yo I just bought a < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > christmas album for the party , because apparently you want christmas music . Y'all better show up to this shit .

My back wall now has insulation . Yay ! 
If I were Diplo , I wonder if I would be a lot better at DJ Hero ? 
< PROPFIRST>'s plan to get Diplo to DJ at my party : lure him in with a gift basket of soaps , a custom made shirt , a dvd of maximum overdrive , and some philly shit . I think its a good plan . You hear that Diplo ? DJ my party and its all yours . 
May plan for this week : Dentist -> DMV -> Lab -> sleep -> lab -> sleep -> lab -> sleep -> airport -> new years -> sleep ? -> lab -> sleep -> sleep -> sleep . This plan might be a little ambitious . Especially that last lab .

I wish I lived in Japan or < PROPFEMALE > . So many good concerts coming up there * sigh * 
is waiting for UPS . Man , if UPS didn't bring me tasty packages , I would really hate them . 
J.D. Salinger died today . Really though , it felt like he died 50 years ago since he hasn't released a fucking book since the 60's . Of course he's still considered like the greatest author ever for some reason , even tho he had like 2 novels . Americans should learn how to write so this guy doesn't get stuck on American author G.O.A.T. lists . We need another World War so we can generate some good authors . 
yay , I now have keys to my lab and office . Seems like I shoulda got this stuff earlier ... 
Celtics vs . Magic , bottle of wine , and take-out , CHYEAH ! 
WTF UPS , \we will deliver your package between 10:30 and 5 . \ " Are you the fucking cable guy ? Jesus . Mad whack . "

Anyone want to go to the Nite < PROPFIRST > or Simian Mobile Disco or < PROPMALE > Lazer/Diplo concert(s ) with me on February 15th/March 13th/April 2nd ?

Devil's Alley 7-9 Happy Hour -> Club Fluid Mad Decent Monday's 10 - ? 
ummm what is this upcoming Tron sequel with music by Daft Punk and why am I just hearing about this now ? 
Ok , so according to current news , the Knicks are going to get Lebron , < PROPMALE > , Bosh and now < PROPMALE > . All they need now is a good Center or PG they can underpay and it will be the greatest team ever assembled that will still lose to the Lakers in the finals . 
Science is somewhat confuzzling . 
At least I am good at science . Take that nanorods . 
Umm ... excuse me , do YOU have a glow in the dark wall in your house ? No , you fuckin ' don't . You know why ? ' Cause you are not as cool as me . So , step off , bitch . Now I just need to make some LED flashlights ...

aaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnndddddddddddd ... I can chill the rest of the week . Guinness Guinness Guinness . 
Dammit , why am I always so far behind on internet memes ? 
Umm ... apparently I am not on my advisor's mailing list and I have to give a presentation today , which obv I just found out about . WTF . 
My friend today asked me why I do a PhD program . I thought it was a silly question , the answer seemed clear to me , I didn't think it necessary to respond , but I told him anyway : I do it for the women . 
Bottle of wine + Sailormoon episodes = awesome ? Fuck yeah . 
Fuck USPS . Anyone wanna go to 55th and Ghetto to pick up my package for me ? Free Guinness in it for you .

Anyone wanna go see LCD Soundsystem May 21 with me ? 35 bucks ? eh ? 
I have a feeling that Penn Transit is going to be more convenient than SEPTA in getting me to my house . 
\You will read this and say ' Geez ! I could come up with better fortunes than that!' \ " ~ Fortune cookie . Ummm ... thanks for that useful fortune . "

In Soviet Russia math does you ! Yo fuck this Tkachenko guy and his magical calculus that makes no sense . Stupid qualifier paper . 
yo crazy night . I met Diplo at a UPenn Design School Happy Hour . < PROPMALE > out with some architects . Had some sushi and went to a diplo/major lazer/rusko concert . Oh did I mention I FUCKING MET DIPLO ?! Pictures to follow .

NSF : \This kid is a really good scientist that wants to push science forward and help people . He has a lot of talent . Let's not give him NSF . \ " Yeah makes sense . Thanks for nothing assholes . " 
Fuck this shit . I am going outside . 
When I close my eyes all I see are combinations of A , T , C , and G and their compliments . Stupid quals . 
Anyone wanna see M.I.A. and Borgore with me in July in NY ? < PROPFIRST > McGurty I am looking in your direction . 
I am dying my hair after quals ( if I pass ) please suggest colors , I haven't decided what I want yet .

Must ... finish ... group ... meeting ... presentation . 
* sigh * no quals extension for the PhDs . 
worst presentation ever . ugh . 
is asleep . 
Presentation in 2.5 hours . 
Presentation complete . Girl Talk and NERD tonight . Chyeah . 
To LCD Soundsystem : Thank you for making an album exactly like your previous album , which is exactly like the album before that . Your lack of innovation is wholly refreshing . While other bands change style to keep ahead of the curve , you realize all these stupid indie kids will buy the same regurgitated crap you've been producing for years . 
To S . T . Milner : I have no idea who you are , but you are a polymer physics pimp . Thank you for making this quals shit easier . 
Dear Fire Drill : Thank you for wasting 15 minutes of my life that I will never get back . 
Damn you < PROPFIRST > der Waal ! Your interactions are annoying . 
It is a sad fact of life that such that such perturbation schemes are slowly convergent ( if at all ) . 
SUCK IT Derjaguin , Landau , Verwey , and Overbeek . I so just pwnt your equation . 
Being at school from 9 to 9 and having to miss a happy hour at triumph = whack . Fuckin quals . 
Design school happy hour -> Snoop Dogg + Kid Cudi Concert 
GGs Trapezoid Method . 
Yo snoop dogg takes forever to come on WTF 
Curiouser and curiouser . 
Lakers vs . Thunder ! Go ... Umm ... Either ? So torn . KD VS . KOBE . Durantula vs . the black mamba/doberman/kyra sedgwick . 
Thunder put up a good fight . Durant needs to find a way to score against artest . Also , the rest of the team needs to get going offensively . really good defense though . 
OH SHIT . today is 4/20 . shouldn't I be like super high or something right now ? 
GGs Biswal model . Chyeah . Just need to add DLVO . So close .......... 
R.I.P. Guru from Gangstarr . 
Must fix code ... Must fix code ... Must fix code ... 
Can nothing be easy ? really ? like wtf . 
No whammy , no whammy , no whammy , no whammy ... STOP ! 
Earth dayyyyyyyyyy ... What a stupid holiday . I am gonna pollute like a motherfucker just to spite it . Take that Earth ! The repercussions of my actions will only be felt by my children hahahahahaha . 
I am coming for you Crocker . Your model is going down motherfucker . DLVO bitch , maybe you've heard of it ? Perhaps you should take that into account ? Gonna fuckin ' smoke your ass . Only wish you could be there . 
Thunder baby ! wooooooooooooooooooooooohhh !!! 
is minimizing free energy like it is his job . 
slightly drunk -> quals 
I am quickly coming to the realization that I am spending way too much time preparing for quals and way too little time being exceedingly drunk . Must reverse trend . 
oh man new mc < PROPFIRST > album . at least 3 songs are about bounty hunters from < PROPFEMALE > wars ( ig88 , dengar , bossk ) which means it will probably have 3 good songs . 
GOOOOOO THUNDERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR !!!!!!! 
Thunder vs . Lakers tonight . I guess I want the Lakers to start winning now . 
I love how , in the context of protein folding , it is easier to describe something random than it is to describe something nonrandom . Seems counterintuitive to me . 
so apparently , I have to sit through an Asher Roth set to get to Girl Talk tomorrow . UGH . WORST . That's like sitting through a Bazaar Royale set before Wu-Tang Clan . 
Despite Asher Roth , Guidos , and being in NewJersey ( I guess the last two go hand in hand ) , the Girl Talk/Matt and < PROPFIRST > show was really good . 
coffee -> stat mech paper -> dinner -> stat mech paper -> lakers/thunder -> stat mech paper . 
All right stat mech paper , you are getting fucking finished today no matter what . 
Yay , Finally done this goddamn paper . Now I just have 2 finals , a final presentation , and my qualifier . Ugh . 
ummm fuck LRSM and its lack of AC . It is fucking hot up in here . 
Brain hurts . Must study phase transforms . Blargg .... 
Oh Shit , new ratatat album . gawdamn . LP4 bitches . 
Nature is boring , I wish , just one time , it would try to MAXIMIZE free energy just to be different . I am sick of trying to find the minimum . 
BOO stupid test gonna make me miss the lakers game . BLARGG . 
ZOMG FINAL !!!!!!!!! WTF IS A TIME CONE ?! IS IT LIKE A PINE CONE ?! IDK ! AHHHHHHHH ! \ 
BLARGG 
I have been going about this phase test the wrong way . Since the grades are relative , I just have to do better than everyone else , or contrariwise , everyone has to do worse than me . Clearly all I need to do is break everyone's hands and feet so they cant take the test and I , being the only able bodied one , will prevail . 
phase final is fucking finished CHYEAHHHHHHH ! now just presentation , qual , interfacial test . so close to doneeeeeeeee . 
Blasting mad jams in LRSM like its my job . come by to 432 , we will have a flash rave or something . 
FUCK YOU STAT MECH ! WHY WILL YOU NOT END ?!?!?!?! 
Two more weeks , OMG , two more weeks . needs to end now . 
well , at least I am done . Presentation coulda been better . 
Qual paper monday -> interfacial test tuesday -> qual practice talk wednesday -> qual the 18th . closin in . 
< PROPFIRST > Hore with the vote of confidence for my qual , chyeah ! 
AHHHHHHHHHH ! QUAL !!!!!!! ZOMG ! FAIL ! ZOMG ! ITS GONNA HURT ! 
I just fucked Crocker up . His calculations were WHACK . 
Man , this thing is easy to write when I don't need to look up references ... 
My paper is going over 20 pages and they can LIKE IT . 
mmmmm ... Taco < PROPFEMALE > and coffee , part of a balanced breakfast . 
Qualifier paper done . Studying interfacial now finally . 
I just learned that Pliny the Elder was an interfacial scientist . 
On a scale of 1 to 10 , my understanding of the Rayleigh Instability is a 7 . 
Oh snap , my committe was chosen : < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPMALE > , Girifalco . Anyone know if the last guy is hard ? I think I know who he is . 
In linear stability analysis , I drop R^3 dependencies like they are H.O.T. 
Yo GGs two < PROPFEMALE > cheat sheet + needle point pen for this interfacial test . I wonder if theyd let me microetch notes on the paper and bring a microscope .... 
Look at me , I am every first year but < PROPMALE > , I have a night off tonight bobobobobo . Must be fuckin ' nice . Yes , I am very bitter if you could not tell . < PROPFEMALE > Murphy < PROPFEMALE > YingYing Chen < PROPFIRST > O'Reilly < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Aspetti Pavan Nukala I wave my fist in your general direction . 
Man , Fuck this class , I know this shit . DLVO , Rayleigh Instability , Gibbs Thompson , Gibbs Duhem . I fuckin ' smoke that shit . I am going to sleep . Peace bitches . 
ZOMG LAST FINAL ! OMG OMG OMG . I APPEAL TO THE GHOST OF DERJAGUIN TO DO WELL ON THIS TEST ! HELP ME DERJAGUIN , YOU ARE MY ONLY HOPE ! 
The ghost of Derjaguin guided my hand , and a 100 was most likely gotten on that exam . Apparently if I prepare , things are easy . This is quite a novel concept for me . 
epic fail in T-minus 2.5 hours . 
I could be at the Flyers game tonight ... sigh 
FUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCK 
Clearly , I should have taken more CBE courses ... * sigh *

Thermo = done ; Kinetics = 2/3 done ; Transport = 90% done ; math = fuck math . 
my kinetics teacher has wayyyyyy too much energy in the morning . 
class -> gseg elections -> hw -> lab work -> sleep 
My kinetics teacher reminds me of some weird amalgam of Mr. Ponisciak and Mrs. Ponisciak ( two old lasalle teachers ) . He has like the driest sense of humor ever , but hes fuckin bouncin off the walls when he teaches like he just stayed up three days on some amphetamine bender . 
homework is straight whack .

ok so i have 14 sixers tickets , section 204 row 7 or so , 5 bucks a piece for the game tomorrow . sorry for spamming the facebooks but i need to sell em . 
chyeah . we got a new first year . i am no longer the low man . 
apparently alcohol + hookah + pulled pork sandwhich at 1 a.m. = cure for the common cold . who knew ? 
well I have wasted my requesite hour , so I guess I should study . transport test monday . This is the equation i will have to know and love : rho(dv/dt + v < PROPFEMALE > ( grad v)) =-P +mu*laplacian(v ) . mmm Navier-Stokes 
My advisor's party was fun . tasty food . cute < PROPFEMALE > cat . nice house . providing more incentive for me to be a professor at a good university . 
marathon made getting to school a total clusterfuck this morning . got a sweet parking spot though so i guess it evens out . 
transport test tomorrow . ugh . 
transport test in like 4 hours , shit is straight whack ! 
My score range for that transport test is something like 15 < My Score < 75 . I def got 15 points and I def lost at least 25 points ( 75 really is probably an overestimation , but whatever ) . what a < PROPMALE > . fuckin lazzara . 
Hookah + beer + burger may have made up for the trauma caused by the transport exam . 
Daft Punk - Tron Soundtrack dropped today ! Cop it ! 
AFM is snoretacular . 
so thermo prof . gave us three choices for topics to cover : solution thermo/fugacity or electrostatics/debye huckel theory or polymer thermo/flory huggins . what do these ppl choose ? fuckin fugacity . most convoluted thermo topic ever . whack . 
lakers baby ! < PROPFIRST > brown is good now ? boom . lakers staff must be amazing . 
the good thing about being in two departments ? two holiday parties . mmm free food and beer . 
wants to drink tonight . does anyone else want to drink ? 
Happy Thanksgiving . Ummm why is it snowing ? 
Godfather is on . Chyeah . 
Man American news channels are awful . 
is now the proud owner of a kinect , an xbox 360 , and a surround sound system . May have went slightly overboard on an impromptu shopping outing . 
presentation monday ugh . party friday ! 
man these afm images look really shitty :( . also they don't make so much sense , why am i seeing more rods on a postively charged surface when the rods are themselves positively charged ? gah . i hate afm . 
party this friday . we got a pinata in the shape of a pokemon , a keg , a gin bucket , tons of liquor , a cake and like 60 people . you should come . 
man worst presentation ever :/ . i suck . 
party this friday . we got 63 ppl comin so far . zomg . 
is debating whether to actually read the chapters for this test or if i should just redo the hwks and memorize formulae ? I think the latter may be a better use of my time . 
for some reason , I have a midterm tomorrow , even thought it is like 2 weeks from the end of the term . 
new simian mobile disco ? this week is slowly getting better . 
Just lucked out . 
had en epic battle with a test this morning , but I think I came out on top . 
This guy talks like < PROPFIRST > walken 
man the world hates on the U.S. 
so much for taking off tomorrow morning . sigh . 
sadly , I had to break down and turn on the heat to warm up the house a little bit for the party tomorrow . hope to see everyone there ! 
getting a transport test back and a meeting with my advisor today . ugh . regardless of what happens with these two things at least I am guaranteed to get super drunk tonight . 
thanks to everyone for coming out to the party ! we had quite alot of ppl over the course of the night . still have alot of beer left though . it was very fun . happy birthday again to < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > and myself . 
home/lab work -> belated birthday dinner -> home/lab work -> sleep 
finds it hard to believe that upenn doesn't have a course on alchemy . 
not a good day to get back tests apparently . 
apparently its < PROPMALE > waits's birthday today . I'm gonna listen to nighthawks at the diner whilst I TEM . 
7 hours on the TEM and I only got 6 out of my 8 samples done * sigh * . 
yo this term is almost over . fucking finally . 4 more classes + 4 finals is all that stands between me and lab work . huzzah . 
autographed kobe all-star jersey from 2003 = awesome . ggs birthday present . 
FINE ! I guess I will start Thermo now . geez . 
must not sleep , must study for finals . 
to all MSE first years : Good luck on your exam . Don't fail . and by don't fail i mean it is inevitable that you will fail , try not to fail too badly . 
dokaka has a full length ( and by full length i mean 85 songs ) album out ? when did this happen ? also group_inou is the best japanese rap I have ever heard , its like if passion pit were jap and rapped . 
needs more beer . 
Hardcore studying starting tomorrow . 
new go ! team album . cop it . 
i hope 24 ounces of coffee is enough to get me through studying thermo and transport today . 
Yo I hate Ju < PROPFEMALE > for making me think thermo is hard when it isnt . I fully understand everything related to fugacity , excess and residual properties after studying it for like 30 minutes . When Ju < PROPFEMALE > taught this shit it was impenetrable . So either , Riggleman is an awesome teacher ( not bad but def not awesome ) or Ju < PROPFEMALE > is awful ( most likely ) . 
* sigh * 24 ounces of coffee wasnt enough . Starbucks -> coup de grace-ing thermo -> Indian Food -> eagles / cowboys game 
guess I should study transport . 
is pretty sure it is time for the percolator . 
is sick of studying transport maybe i will switch back to thermo . 
New < PROPFEMALE > album ( < PROPFEMALE > YingYing Chen should get it ) , new lil < PROPMALE > single leaked , and beegees anthology . good day so far . 
is basically done studying for thermo , a day early ! more time for transport after tap house . 
me and < PROPFIRST > M . Deen are pretty tight now . also I need some new music . 
good luck MSE first years on your thermo test today . 
finals are whack . snow is whack . korean taco trucks closing early is whack . this day is turning out to be super whack . 
fuck this shit . bout to take my first final of the term . cant wait until this shit is over with . 4 to go . 
so uh thermo was pretty easy . unless i royally fucked up of course . transport tomorrow . 
transport will be over FOREVER at 2 p.m. today . So excited . I have never had a class cause me so much anguish and trepidation . 
wow that was umm the hardest test I have ever taken , I guess I should stop hating on Ju < PROPFEMALE > . Definitely didn't do that great , but hopefully im around average . I am getting a beer and some lunch . 
new ghostface killah leaked . also new < PROPMALE > mansell . cop ' em ! 
got me a camus novel . gonna read it . feels good to take a break from studying . 
Studying Kinetics/Math 
man penn is mad nazi-ish , I can't check my grades until I fill out course surveys ? ridiculous . anyway I got to use the word hugger-mugger so I guess it evens out . 
hmmm sushi or indian for dinner ? decisions decisions . 
brief aside from studying . question : why is there a band called hype < PROPMALE > ? and why is the first track on their debut just a slowed version of the pokemon theme song with a new beat which sounds like something rjd2 threw together on a bad day circa third hand < PROPFEMALE > ? 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Aspetti is < PROPMALE > over for the first time . I am so proud of him ! 
yo wtf is going on in this eagles game ? werent we just down like 20 points or something ? i wish i coulda watched this . 
I guess I am done studying kinetics ? Have to finish up math . 2 more finals . This shit needs to end quick sos i can gets drunk . 
wow longest gorte test ever . one more final ! omg omg omg omg . 
< PROPFIRST > Carchidi your father is a < PROPMALE > . that final was ridiculous . fuck . makes me almost not want to get drunk ... almost . 
cleaning my desk -> end of semester research report -> christmas ( yeah i don't have a lot to do this week ) . 
man I hate advisor pop in so scary . 
Man , Gorte is a machine , how the fuck did he grades those tests so fast ? 
Is watching Soul Train . Chyeah . 
is going to attempt to learn korean in preparation for the summer . anyone want to recommend a good grammar book ? i already got < PROPFEMALE > stone korean , I just need like a book . 
i am the only one here in my lab today :'( . even the foreign students didn't come in . 
does not want to do this semester research report . ugh . 
OMG I got a B in engineering math ! suck on that carchidi !!!!! totally thought i was gonna get a C in that class cause of the final . PHEWWWWWWWWWWWWWW ... 
man the magic look pretty good . this team might go pretty far in the playoffs if Hibachi AKA Agent Zero AKA Quick Draw McGraw AKA < PROPMALE > Arenas doesnt like destroy the locker room ( either with guns or his negative attitude ) . 
< PROPFEMALE > christmas . 
the knicks are good now ? must be the end of days .

Man , wine gets me mad fucked up . 
Apparently some dudes from Harvard reversed aging in mice . Perhaps de grey is right and in 30 years we can extend our life spans 10 fold . I call first dibs ! 
pitching the idea to advisor went pretty well , surprisingly . I have to come up with an idea of how this project fits into my thesis lol .

Yo , we goin out tomorrow . Who is coming ? 
oh snap Mubarak finally stepped down . took long enough . #power of the masses . 
is not feeling so good :( 
stomach virus and my heat doesn't work ? best day ever .

hooray , I am no longer sick . 
is still at lab :( 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Aspetti is serenading me over text message . be jealous . or not . probably the latter . 
totally just dispersed < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Aspetti's wire in my polymer matrix ! 
these TEM images make no sense . the physics tells me one thing and the experiments tell me something completely different , either I am seeing new physics ( not bloody likely ) or I am missing something . 
man , how do you lose to the Cavs ? Really Lakers ? I could beat the Cavs I mean c'mon . sigh . 
Lab -> Laundry -> Dinner -> Spurs v . Bulls -> Sleep . 
and I cannot believe that worked . hooray !

yay , my heat is fixed ( again ) . Not that it matters as I probably wasn't going to run it anyway . 
oh shit , melo is a new york knick ? lol what a bad trade . 
ugh , I hate Fourier transforms . why am i learning this again ? 
sweet we get a physics postdoc (?!) at our chemical engineering seminar . I am excited despite her (?!) talk title using the same word twice . Everyone should go . 3 p.m. Wu and Chen . free coffee and doughnuts . 
The amount of physicists in the audience scares me . 
that talk was disappointing . * sigh * 
like , don't tell me to buy 3 books if you aren't gonna teach from them #Crocker is nuts ... just sayin ... now I have 4 stat mech books which is exactly 5 more than anyone needs . 
Talk by the writer of my favorite polymer physics textbook today . I hope it is good . 
ummmm wtf are the celtics thinking ? at least my Thunder got better : Perkins + Nate Robinson to Thunder for Kristic and < PROPMALE > Green . 
is totally gonna recruit a bunch of Chemical Engineering students to join my department . #CBE <3 
Food was good chyeah . 
showin ' perspectives around the lab today . exciting . 
I hope I get this question on my qualifier ( it is actually from one from 2003 ): \what is the definition of an ideal gas ? \ " lol I think I can answer that one ! " 
Sleeppppy 
making rods + UV/VIS + preparing films + analyzing TEM images = long day . 
my dentist is completely insane . 
sweet , thunder extended perkins ' contract . very exciting . this starting 5 is pretty awesome . geez . 
TEM images don't lie , I am getting some tasty statistics . Too bad this is the most tedious thing ever * sigh * 
chyeah , early day . I am totally going home soon . 
class -> lab -> lunch -> lab -> seminar -> lab -> dinner -> meeting prep . If you ignore every other one starting at the first lab , then my day is pretty awesome ! 
oh man the volume fraction for all these samples is actually consistent ? sweet . #not messing up simple math 
The room has more profs than PhDs WTF 
meeting prepppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp 
individual meetings with my advisor cause me much unneeded stress * sigh * 
yay my advisor thought my images were awesome . hooray . overall a successful meeting . now I want to go home haha . 
joint GSEG + Social Policy and Practice Happy Hour coming up soon . be on the lookout . 
yay ! my experiments are repeatable . OK im going to sleep now . ZZZZZzzzzzzz .... 
going home . dinner -> shower -> Public House . 
Lab -> Cricket (!?) -> Sitar Lunch -> ??? 
is doing laundry and watching good will hunting . 
my mother just responded to my email with the word \kuel !! \ " . I am so confused . " 
yo this data is mad whack . 
man that group meeting took FOREVER . 
Dentist -> H-Mart -> ??? 
Lab and then Sixers vs . Thunder tonight . Chyeah ! 
the sink in my lab smells like fish . it is not pleasant . 
Sixers vs . Thunder with < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Aspetti , Xiaowen Tang , Pavan Nukala , and < PROPMALE > Donnelly ! 
hmmmm ... I wonder if DMF will work ... 
is on the TEM for a few hours . As UV/VIS was inconclusive , this is going to make or break my hypothesis . Hopefully , I get great images . 
is pretty sure that worked . 
yay my advisor is excited about the images . now i don't feel like doing any more work lol 
study study study study 
class -> study/lab -> lunch -> study/lab -> dinner -> study . 
Nitrile gloves are ludicrously expensive . 
diplo is coming to penn this friday ?!?!?!?!?!?! gwahhhhhhhhhhhhh ? why was i just informed of this today !

man I hate SEPTA . stupid detour through the ghetto took an hour . I could have walked faster to penn than they got me there . geez . 
since I know nothing about NCAA basketball , i made a program to predict the outcome of all the games to fill out the bracket for me . F4 : Duke , Kansas , Ohio St. , Florida . 
This test tomorrow is either going to be super easy or super difficult . my money is on super difficult . 
thank god thats over . 
is pretty sure my advisor should be at this talk ...
