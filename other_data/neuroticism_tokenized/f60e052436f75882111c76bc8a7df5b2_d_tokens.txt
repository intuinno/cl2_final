hey folks guess what ? stop changing your relationship statuses every other hour . seeing so many people do it made me and < PROPFIRST > want to conduct a social experiment to fuck with you guys . so ? the world didn't explode when we ' broke up ' . only some of my friends seemed a little concerned ... thanks guys , <3 ya . but yeah . STOP CHANGING YOUR FUCKING STATUSES EVERY FUCKING SECOND BECAUSE YOU ARE FUCKING LAME . the end . 
it's hard to take in that something you've worked so hard for , and for so long .... is ending . and all you can do is bury your face in your hands and cry , cry , cry . because nothing will ever be the same again . 
hope you bitches had a good christmas ...... cause i know i did . :] \ 
( plus an AWESOME xmas < PROPFEMALE > <3 ) 
getting my phone back at the end of this week ... hopefully ;D 
i don't wanna have to make an ' event ' out of this .... but i might anyway . \ 
just got my phone back so text me with your name , message me on here , or get back to me somehow . or else ... I KILL YOU ! \ 
peace psychos . 
interviewer : \if you could no longer sing ? \ " \ 
i was gonna buy a new outfit to look good for new years < PROPFEMALE > but then i said fuck it ...... i have enough clothes and enough sexiness already :D lmao
