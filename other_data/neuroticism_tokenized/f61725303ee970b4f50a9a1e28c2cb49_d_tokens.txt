the black math horseman !!! on another note .... what are some of ya'lls funkier holiday traditions ? for instance , on thanksgiving being the first person stickin ' a finger in the center of the punkin ' pie was a great and annoying triumph ... or ... for a time i enjoyed naked romps on the streets of berwyn as the new year began . 
thank you to all for the love and support .
