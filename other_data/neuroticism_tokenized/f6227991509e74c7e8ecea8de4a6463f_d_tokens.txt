wish i had a job that would work me more than 1 day a week ... -_- 

why is it that when someone goes out , they care so deeply about what the strangers looking at them think ? 
im excited ! finally got the big things for my halloween costume , the only thing im missing are pants , shoes , vest , and gloves ... all of which are easy to find except them gloves . looked all thru the mall yesterday and couldnt find anything ! ugh . 
lol what a long awesome day its been ! thank god im home for the moment , prob about to go drink thou so wish me luck ! @_@ 
so ready to be off thursday and friday ! 
you know , it truly discust me when you cant even walk thru your own house without being stalked like an animal 
having to brag about my new lap top ! >_< 
Smokers . Cant live with them , Cant live ... with em 
people confuse me . why is it that when one thing happens people always run out and do something crazy ? its like its a rule or something ! 
Love is the one emotion i cant stand because there is no controlling what will happen with it ... 
how can people stand to be inside a house all day ?! my god its killing me ! 
today one of my friends came into work with her 2 kids . when i saw her i ran over to give her a hug , and when i looked at her kids her son , who cant be more than 3 or 4 , had a shit eating grin on his face . He instantly lunged at me and gave me a HUGE hug , which made me smile because he barely came to my hips . :P i had to post about it , it made my day ^_^ 
Facebook , where all the kids you thought you'd lost and would never see again reside ... ^_^ 
its weird seeing pictures of people you havent seen in years and almost not recognizing them 
i just made a SNOW angel at Tjc at 1:04 am ! When you look up it it looks like your in a giant snow globe that someone shook up ... 
to all the couples Happy Valentines Day . and to all the single people ( as one of my friends pointed out ) Happy Singles Awareness Day ... v_V 
its a really weird feeling when your staring at your computer screen sooo out of it , that when your head automatically moves on its own you completely forget where you are and get nervous 
thank god for 2 friends i work with keeping me in check , otherwise i would have came unglued and cussed some people out today ... 
lol , so i just jumped out of the shower to head to my room . when i got here i was like \damn ! my room smells good ! \ " so i went to my computer to hit play on my playlist and then i realized i lit a candle right before i jumped in the shower >_<" 
your only as weak as you let yourself be ... 
i actually got a plus today ! >_< mildly excited , i am 
i think i have a fixation with drinking and dressing up ... on a side note , St Patties day is supposedly wed ? Who wants to do something ? 
today was an amazing day ! i woke up early enough to go buy some cigerettes from the store before work , then on the way to work i heard non-stop good music ! which put me in an even better mood followed by drinkin with some homies/homettes ? lol and to top it off i got to dance with quala ! its been a seriously pro day >_< 
got a new phone ! >_< techincally it was an update for my old phone , but its still new ! and here come the 7th im gunna be changing my plan and getting yet another new phone ! so im pretty excited 
when life gives you lemons , make lemonaid . but what do you do when life gives you a rock ? 
when I go fishing I would rather have it hot and < PROPFEMALE > , than < PROPFEMALE > and cloudy :/ 
omg its finally < PROPFEMALE > ! omg ! its offically fishing time ! >_< 
well im kinda sad . On my mini Vacation i was supposed to go fishing and get an uber sexy tan , and go back to work glistening but ... i went fishing , got a sunburn , went back , didnt tan , went back again , still didnt tan , and now its time to go back to work ... v_v but the time off in itself was completely worth it ^_^ 
ive had a song called \the pursuit of happiness\ " stuck in my head all day ! if you havent heard it its pretty raw its by kid cudi ratatat " 
i've found out 2 things today ... Eh (<- canadian for a ) . ) my phone wont recieve picture messages ... :/ and B . ) i dont give a sh*t about people feelings if im being honest . oh on a side note , ask me an honest question , and i'll give you an honest answer . Peace

So , due to financial difficulities i didnt get enough for my car ... just my luck

i dont care how lazy you are , if your too lazy to make muffins ... somethings wrong ! btw i made muffins >_< 
lol so when i came home tonight from drinking i went downstairs to the garage to work out . when i got there i did my bench pressing , and i started to work on my curls and i noticed a small set of eyes staring at me ... it was a baby possum ! i didnt know if it was real or fake so i stared at it for a few seconds and it started moving . lol i was like wtf ? there is a baby possum watching me work out lawl ! good times 
if facebook had a music player , i would prob only check my myspace like maybe once a wekk or so , if that :P 
i won my m'fn bet ! 8:26 ! fuck yeah ! 
how hard is it to find some hamburger helper and a small can of pinapple juice ?! 
so im getting my car fixed now ... 8am is way too damn early ... v_v 
i keep hearing from people at work that \theres always something to do . \ " but they dont ever tell me what it is . thats kinda like giving someone a screwdriver and saying go screw something . " 
omfg ! its actually raining !!!!!! >_< 
fuck it ! im throwing up the hands and saying fuck you to my car ! 
benadryl : the unknown cure for cancer

3 life rules to live by : Live life , party hard , and no regrets\ 
\ 
1 . Live life . Live life the way you want ! \ 
2 . Party hard . Whatever you do , do it to the fullest ! \ 
3 . No regrets . Never regret what you do because as soon as you do , someone will step in and make you second guess yourself ! 
so shits going down tomorrow , and im gunna be there in the middle ... when its all said and done , imma go drinking . if anyone wants to come im goin to the pub 
^_^ 
im not rasist , but i swear to god i think < PROPFEMALE > n people were put on this earth just to piss everyone off ! not < PROPFEMALE > n like native americans , but < PROPFEMALE > ns like from < PROPFEMALE > ... 
so i found out 2 interesting things today ... 1 . When the mood is directly above you it is a scientific fact that you weigh less ! and 2 . There is a place in this world that is literally hotter than hell ! like people in hell look up at you and say \Damn ! glad im not there ... \"" 
Day 26 . What i once thought was a mere science experiment has amplified into a full fledge war . It started on one side of my body and is slowly ingulfing the otherhalf ... While fighting off the infection i found that as it leaves my right hand , it begins growing on my left ... how much longer can i survive ... 
WOOO ! We have a Washer !!!!! 1 ! 
goin to the pub tonight , just curious who all's going ? 
so 2 things happened today . i went to my little half brothers vacation bible skool and wow ... idk its because this is texas but all the chicks there were very homely , very east texas looking kinda chicks ... thank god im not looking for a religious chick otherwise i would be f'd! ( at least if i was looking for a christian chick ) 
the second thing was when i got home i didnt have my keys so i reached into my pocket to get my phone and i felt a thud on my shoulder . when i looked back i saw a little like 3-4inch lizard chillin on my shoulder . he kinda looked like a parrot on the shoulder of a pirate , so i made my phone call and when i went to look for him again to let him off on safe ground he was gone ... good times ^_^ 
ok , so i just got SUPER BORED and decided to look at my myspace and view peeps i went to skool with ... OMG ! i went from ' 05-'09 at JT , and half the people on there have either worked at sams or are working at sams ! which made me laugh SOOO hard !!! just had to share that . 
have you ever had an instance in which you question everything you do , and why you do it and kinda wonder what would happen if you changed ? 
i love how i have 104 friends but the one person i really dont want to see , always seems to pop up on my random \top 6 \"" 
i was recently informed , Cheesy Gordita Crunches are BACK !!!!!!!! 
man , its getting boring sitting at home :/ 
goin to see some fireworks at < PROPFIRST > park ? if you want to come or if you know a better place hit me up ! ( 903)590-6207 ! >_< 
so the fireworks show was really shitty ! so ... me and < PROPFIRST > decided to get our drink on , head to get some fireworks of our own , get in a mini race , buy fireworks and then shoot them by ourselves :P twas badass ! 
hispanic chicks always have the most badass names ! ex . Yalitza , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , Besitha ( i think thats how you spell it ) 
just sat down at my comp , eating a tuna sandwich and i've already seen at least 3 \eclipse\ " movie trailers and it hasent even been 5 whole < PROPFEMALE >..." 
is it just me or does beer thats been on ice always taste better than beer from a fridge ? 
if theres one thing that irritates me its when someone leaves the toilet seat up ... 
man this friday thru monday thing is throwing me off ! i keep thinking its sunday already , but then i remember nope ! its only sat ... man i need a drink 
not looking forward to work ... 
why are all mimes french ? 
in this town we call home , everyone hail to the pumpkin song ! 
so i moved some of my halloween pix over from 08 since some of my new peeps had never seen them :P 
mmh taco < PROPFEMALE > ! 
well i just found out how much its gunna cost for the part on my car ... $160 ... deliberating on whether to go on and buy it or hold off alittle bit longer . My thing now is that may or may not be all thats wrong ... 
you know your bored when you go outside every hour or so to smoke , just to kill time 
well i found out something very interesting just now ... i both love my phone and hate it . I love it because its the only phone i've heard of thats with verizon that doesnt cost over $100 , but i hate this phone because i just found out that a ) if you put a folder onto the memory card it can read only that folder . ( not multiple ones ) and b ) it wont read any music thats over 6 gigs ... v_v 
well shit ! my plans of ultimate evil have been thwarted ... sigh ... v_v 
well due to burning my mouth today , it is really difficult to eat ... 
i've somehow misplaced my phone ... hmm 
ok i plan to go to the pub tomorrow and am curious if anyone else wants to come ? if so hit me up ^_^ 
im fucking done ! 
whooo ! today was an amazing day ! at the end i got to see < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > ! i will miss them more than i've missed anyone before ! V_V 
We can dance if we want to , We can leave your\ 
friends behind\ 
' Cause your friends don't dance and if they don't\ 
dance , Well they're no friends of mine \ 
I say , we can go where we want\ 
to , A place where they will never find\ 
And we can act like we come from out\ 
of this world , Leave the real one far behind 
omg ! this is the first time in months that i sign on and no one else is on ! O_O 
imagine if the whole world was nothing but morning people ... after 9pm would the world shut down ? 
WE wear the mask that grins and lies , \ 
It hides our cheeks and shades our eyes , — \ 
This debt we pay to human guile ; \ 
With torn and bleeding hearts we smile , \ 
And mouth with myriad subtleties . \ 
Why should the world be over-wise , \ 
In counting all our tears and sighs ? \ 
Nay , let them only see us , while\ 
We wear the mask . 
i think people make alot of assumptions without real backing . if you can show me proof then im fine with whatever , but if your just running your mouth ( at this point ) i would really prefer you keep it to yourself 
just got home from < PROPFIRST>'s party and damn ... i am tired ! 
i kinda want a cigarette ... brb 
well today i lost yet another one of my favorite floor associates v_v and to make things worse , someone jumped on her today ! ooh not a good idea 
so on my epix quest to find the ultimate halloween costume , i found a couple of fairly creative ideas . But i found out that in order to get a legit \toast\ " costume you are going to have to make it yourself ... hmmm ... " 
lol 1 ? on a sunday ? its 172 :P im kinda nervous ~_~ 
Seriously , I need to start getting cool with these new floor associates otherwise I'm gunna start becoming a dushe . 
< PROPFIRST > d's and pizza ... what an interesting combination :P 
I'm not good at anything , but I'm decent at everything . And I'm badass at some things >_< 
seriously if i didn't desperately need the money i would totally call in tomorrow ... :/ 
I don't feel like f*cking with it anymore ... I'm too tired . Turning off my phone for the night , I work tomorrow at 12:30 so my phone will prob be back on at 11:30 ish if I remember . If you want anything or need anything leave me a message or txt . Phone # is under info , deuces . 
sweet zombie jesus ! as soon as i sign on i notice i have 18 friends online at 1 time ... O_O im very impressed ! :P 
what am i at work but a massive flirt , and a slave ... and they have the audacity to tell me i cant talk to people ? psh plz ! im gunna do what i want , when i want ! and if they have a problem they can tell me specifically ! 
in one way i kinda want to take steps toward rekindling my friendship with some peeps , but in another i want to tell them to fuck themselves and if they really want to be cool again they should have the balls to take the first step ... hmmm , thank god im off the next few days . time to think 
idk why but i want some pancakes and syrup right aboot now 
Robitussin ... why do they purposely make it taste like ass ? its not even the good ass that everyone wants ( whatever your pref might be ) , its like that nasty ( ew ... why did i get into that ? was i drunk ? maybe high ? idk but ugh ) kinda ass that makes you feel dirty and kinda regret what you did . but you know what ? you did it and you cant go back and change it , so you just have to accept it and move on with life ... >_> 
have you ever been so tired of shit , you just wanna cut someone ? not like a pin prick but more of a deathly blow ? 
wow i just now realized how much i smoke ... i go thru a pack in 2 days ... damn ... oh well . stress is stress 
so i got to go to the fair today with my sister which i have to say was pretty damn fun ! and very enlightening ! i have come to realize we are alot closer than i thought :P 
So after talking with some friends over drinks I've come to realize something . No matter what my friends are my friends ! Even if we don't always talk , or we're going thru a rough patch , i still have the same love for them i always had . And eventually we'll see eye to eye again and things will go back to being well in the world ^_^ 
not gunna lie , i dont know if i care much for this new \great value\ " pizza :/ " 
well once again my super awesome plan for tonight has been foiled by work ... :/ when i got to work i checked out my schedule and saw i had off tomorrow ! yes !!!! first sunday off in months ! then i went back later after talking to a friend , and realized that , that was the 3rd weeks schedule :/ i hat you sams club : C 
well im thinking aboot goin to clisks , i heard theres supposed to be some bands playin but the most of the peeps i was supposed to go with canceled :/ hmm what to do , what to do ? 
hey to all my facebook buddies , i ask a favor . today is officially my sisters b-day ! if you can , plz go on her facebook and tell her happy b-day , idk how many people are actually gunna say anything so i just figured it might be kinda fun to have her sign on and have a HUGE wall of people saying it :P plz and thanks ^_^ 
im thinking of starting a poke war on facebook ... i have picked a couple of my first targets ... >_> 
i love how when your in the middle of a thought , and your brain shuts down randomly and you just sit there in limbo for upwards of 10-15 sec until you catch yourself and be like \wtf was i just doing ? \"" 
tussin , mucinex and benadryl ... my night is set ! tussin for some cough suppression , mucinex to break this shit up , and benadryl because thats the cure for cancer . 
ok so now i feel like an idiot ! today around 5pm or so i decided i wanted to take a nap , so when i woke up it was 7pm ... i thought it was 7 am , which means i had been asleep for 14 hours ! it took me txting a friend to realize i had only been asleep for 2 hours ... v_v 
woo ! i just purchased a new-er car ! >_< damned excited ! 
so i just now burnt a cd to go in my cd player ( never had one before , so im pretty stoked ! ) and wow ... its pretty f'n badass ! not gunna lie ... 
lol so im mildly concerned ... when i got home today there was 1 pizza box in the fridge . i came to my room , < PROPMALE > out for a few , then went outside to hangout with < PROPFIRST > , and when i come in i get my cup and walk to the fridge to get some tea , and there was mysteriously 3 pizza boxes ... where they came from idk , so im mildly nervous _-_ 
I love the hills and valleys of life . One < PROPFEMALE > , your on top of the world and you feel like nothing could harm you . The next thing you know your falling , and there's nothing to grab on to , so you just fall and keep going ... Eventually you stop and continue your life , because there's no going back and there's no since in sittin there waiting . 
I have made a lot of mistakes in my life , and I don't regret any of them . It goes against my 3 rules of life . The only thing is , if I could I would go in and change 1 thing ... I wouldn't open my damn mouth so fucking much . I've come to realize that the more I say , the more I wish I didn't at a later time ... It has/will continue to bite me in the ass . 
\I love your ______ ! \ " Copy and repost this and find out what people love about you . ( If you're brave enough . ) " 
and as if by magic , my night gets worse ... 
True friends will stand behind you thru thick and thin . Fake friends will turn on you as soon as you loose popularity . 
i sometimes get so busy looking at different angles of other peoples problems i forget there are more sides of the coin to my own ... 
To all my friends , past present and future . To all the people i have met , currently know , or will ever meet . I love you . I pray that your life will be filled with joy and happiness and i hope that all your problems don't plague you . Take care , i'm out . \ 
Deuces . 
So today was the first day i've actually been awake early enough , and actually got to see the sun rise in many a year . Well it got me thinking about something ... 
so i got to see and < PROPFEMALE > out with a couple of really cute hispanic chicks tonight , so im pretty happy ^_^ 
i feel sooo bad for my hands . every day i look down and theres a new cut , scrap , or bruise on em ... 
i think im turning into my family , im getting sleepy :P 
* crack * \Get in line . \ " \ " What ? no ! \ " * crack * \ " Get in line . \ " \ " are you deaf ? \ " \ 
i can honestly say , that sometimes i hate premonitions ... 
lol i think i've finally snapped ... and what an amazing feeling it is :P 
the powerman concert was pretty fun actually ! i had fun hanging with my peeps and meeting new people ^_^ 
well nothing to do tonight ... prob just gunna chill :P 
i just now realized that the actor playing beatle juice is the same guy from batman ... ( the original ) 
i LOVE November 1st ! half price < PROPFEMALE > at walmart ? oh hell yeah ! got a big ass bag of mixed reese's < PROPFEMALE > s and tootsie rolls for less than $5 ... * throws hands up * what more could one toast ask for ? 
I have a master plan ... im thinking about pissing off every person i work with that i don't like ... should prove interesting :P 
Ok seriously , where the hell do snails come from ? are they born ? do they hatch ? are they asexually reproduced ? if one is trecking along the sidewalk and leaves a trail of slime , can one randomly appear from it and be like \whats goin on guys ? \ " and skutter away ? im seriously concerned and curious where these creepy little bastards come from ! " 
Remember Remember the 5th of November , the gun powder , treason , and plot . I can think of no reason the gun powder treason should ever be forgot ... 
yarg me maties ! if ye booty be shakin someone be stealin ye treasure ! * insert pirate face * 
this extra hour of sleep crap just isnt cutting it . i've come to realize that i keep going to bed earlier and earlier , and i wake up with more and more time to kill before i go to work ... this is annoying . 
i swear i think the more im around people as a whole , the more i loose faith in humanity ... thank god i have jewry duty tomorrow at 8:30 to fuel this dysfunction @_@ 
Your not truly living unless your laughing or crying 
Why is homophobia such a big deal ? I keep hearing people freak out because they know or work with a gay person , and they are terrified because of it . Why ? The only excuse I ever hear is because \What if they're checking me out ? \ " Personally I would take that as a compliment because it means your sooo irresistible that both genders want you . But it seriously does piss me off that people freak out about gay people ! " 
gunna be goin to applebees to get our drink on tonight around 8 , if anyone wants to come hit me up or just show up :P 
Omg , today was better than christmas ! soooo many gorgeous hispanic chicks walking around today ... mmh ! omg ! >_< 
lol oh the tangled thorny webs we spin ... 
the 2 biggest things i hate are when a mans a bitch , and manipulators ! 
i swear to god i hate being a good samaritan ! actually im not even really i just got goaded into shit today which ended me with a fucking ticket ! omfg ! i hate people sooo much right now ! * angered face !!!!! * -_- 
i swear to god from now on i will have a manager walk me out when i leave at night ... 
happy thanksgiving 
i hate when i try to find people on fb , and no matter how hard i try i can never find them :/ 
it feels like something big happened today . Dec 2nd feels like it should be something ... anyone have any ideas ? 
did you know rolling your tongue is genetic ? 
what is that god forsaken drumming at tjc all about ? 
i think i txt or play videogames too much . today i was dropping paper in receiving and i looked over and i saw an < PROPMALE > toy that read \Art 101\ " but when i first read it i thought it said \ " Art lol\ " and that made me smile :P " 
after its over you say \ooh what a lovely tea party . \"" 
once you stop and look back at your life you will notice alot of change . most of which i see in my life thou is bad , then i follow where it started to the present and realize exactly where i sit in the storm of shit ... 
i swear to god , i cant wait for christmas to be be over ! i want to start chillin again . 
4 more days until this god forsaken holiday is over ! 
Twas the day before Christmas and Toast was at work , and thing only thing he feared was eating no pork . < PROPMALE > sat beside Toast biding his time , contemplating when he could stab , him in the eye . When out on the floor there < PROPFEMALE > such a clatter , Toast < PROPFEMALE > to his feet to see whats a matter . The sight that he saw made him shutter with freight , Twas a lowly Pooh bear having a fight . 
bought a pack ... what a way to start off the new years @_@ 
If you ended 2010 single ... Put this as your status and if someone inboxes you with a heart ? it means they want you for 2011 ... ( : 
i hate silence , it means somethings happening somewhere else . whether that be good or bad depends on the person or the situation :/ 
I am so confused in this crazy labyrinth , that im about ready to throw up the hands and say f**k it ... 
Lol thank you all my Fb peeps for the birthday wishes ! >_< I hope everyone has a blessed year ! 
Oh Tussin ... Why do you have to taste sooo amazing ? @_@ 
alright so im thinking of having a big birthday bash blowout thing for all my peeps that were born in < PROPFIRST > ... prob gunna go to the < PROPFEMALE>'s or cheddars or some place to get some drinks ... anyone interested ? 
ok so i officially have a day and time set for this \January Birthday Celebration\ " if your interested hit me up so i can get an idea of who all wants to help celebrate >_<" 
im in a mixture between nervous , excited , and sad all at once ... what a weird nirvana 
i think im the whitest person you'll ever meet . but im that off color white :P 
When every day feels like a year and all your looking for is a glimmer of hope and you try to find it only to get shot down ... tis a terrible feeling . the only thing left is to stare at the ground and keep moving forward , theres no reason to stop . 
just wanted to say thanks to all my peeps that made it last night , idk about you'll but i had a blast ! thanks again for coming ^_^ 
you live , you love , you accept . acceptance is a wonderful thing getting there is the hard part ... 
ok so im really curious , what is the freezing point of dew ( mountain dew) ? i stuck a dew outside tuesday night , when i went to go smoke and completely forgot about it . today when it was snowing i saw it and shook it but its still just as liquid as it was before i ever stuck it outside ... weird ... >_> 
Texas on average one of the hotest states in the U.S. 10 months of heat and 2 months of cold ... i honestly never thought i'd say this but i cant wait for the heat :/ 
i've come to realize one thing today ... if i dont like you , im not going to try to pretend like i do . 
\Males have higher amounts of the dehydrogenase enzyme 
Happy Singles Awareness Day ! @_@ 
well theres one good thing that happened today , i learned it was my last day on day crew ! >_< sooooo super stoked ! 
word to the wise , dont do defensive driving at the last < PROPFEMALE > ... i would rather sit in the class room and get it all done at once than sit here , and keep failing one part of my test 6 times and keep having to redo the entire section ... ugh ! just shoot me ! >:( 
< PROPFEMALE > , it taste like chicken ... if chicken was a < PROPFEMALE > . 
thank god im finally finished with defensive driving ... omg it took forever ! 
Going drinking thursday , anyone interested ? 
i could be one of those little old lady killers . im not , but i could be and thats all that matters >_< 
Integrity :\ 
in·teg·ri·ty \ 
–noun\ 
1 . adherence to moral and ethical principles ; soundness of moral character ; honesty . \ 
2 . the state of being whole , entire , or undiminished . 
i was just told , that if i am going to marry a hispanic chick she is \supposedly\ " supposed to be able to make flour tortillas ... i swear i dont think i've ever laughed that hard in my entire life ! " 
huh , this is gunna be the first time in almost 4 years im not gunna dress up for halloween at work ... i think im slightly depressed : C 
i believe that when your having a bad day , satan puts things in your way to make them worse , but ... i believe that god can do the same thing to make your day go smoother ^_^ 
i have a new weakness in life , nerdy chicks . Now , to all my hispanic ladys ... You guys are always number 1 ! I love you all . Nerdy chicks im not physically attracted to but there's just something about them that makes me want to crawl in that brain and figure them out >_< 
every day on nights i learn something new ... tonights lesson , 2 applefritters , an Oj , and a pig ' n a blanket thats as big as my hand ... a pretty damn good way to end the day if i may say so myself . ^_^ 
You and I wake up in a Mexican jail together . Using only 4 words , what would you say to me ? \ 
Note : If you comment , you must copy and paste this to your status , so I may comment on yours as well ... Be a good sport and play along ... 4 words is harder than you think ! 
Night crew lesson number 2 : i love people who are unique . ex . ) tonight my stocker asked me to dropped some suger for her , but she pronounced it \hugar\ " . which is fucking badass ! it makes her stand out amongst the rest . honestly how often do you hear \ " hugar \"?" 
i swear i dont think i've ever been asked point blank if i like \fat chicks\ " <- her words ... my response \ " uh ... \ " def caught me off guard :P " 
not gunna lie , im glad i can get drunk with my friends once a week . because every time i do i always feel sooo much better :P 
Hey , you might want to put on a helmet so it dont make a mess when i blow your miiiiinnnd ! >_< 
i now understand why geniuses are usually alcoholics and drug addicts ... the more you know the more you want to forget :/ \ 
on a side note , DRINKING TOMORROW !!!!! >_< i am stoked ! 
roll call ! who alls coming drinking tonight ? o_O 
gotta love them sleep deprived , drunken dreams >_< 
REM and tater tots ... what an awesome combo ^_^ 
im tired of this 2 hour nap crap , then waking up for a few hours and then falling asleep again ... 
i wish i could change ' poking\ to \ " purring\ " because i think that would make for a much more interesting facebook :P " 
every day i become more confused , and annoyed ... will today be the day i snap , and do something i regret ? or am i gunna save that card for when i desperately need it ? am i gunna call someone out , or am i gunna bite my tongue ? i just dont know anymore :/ 
most people see it as they lost an hour of sleep , i see it as i gained an hour of night :P 
the more you know about the world , the easier life seems to be 
up until today i have never regretted any of my mistakes . but today i realized that one mistake i made didnt effect me , but someone i care about . i only wish that i could have put forth a little more effort , into securing the situation and not just slacking off because i really didnt care . :-/ 
goin on 36 hours of being awake now , with only one 2 hour nap ... not gunna lie , pretty proud of myself . thank god for energy drinks and hatred for my job right ? kinda want to stay up and only take 1 more 2 hour nap that way i can be up for 52 hours with 4 hours of sleep . that way on my 2 days off , i can crash and burn to hopefully forget this god forsaken week . 
alright , going drinking tonight ... is anyone interested ? 
\ ... sir is that your penis ? \ " my response \ " uh ... yeah ? \"" 
ok , i understand that people who work overnights are already kinda weird , but when i go to the hospital to see someone at 7 in the morning and you have a pissy attitude towards me even thou you havent done shit all night ... i swear to god , i'll slap the shit out of you ! dont have that attitude with me . 
Dear Facebook Peeps/ Drinking Associates , \ 
I have good news and bad news . First the bad news : Today will probably be the last day i go drinking on Tuesdays . \ 
Now the good news : Starting next week my days are officially changing . Instead of getting Tuesdays and Wednesdays off , I'm going to be switching to Wednesdays and Thursdays off . 
And in an instance the angels fall and lightning crashes , and the world comes to a halt and your left wondering .. What went wrong . 
what an absolutely boring day :/ 
He says , \Son 
i think ive officially hit that point ...
