Just saw my mother for the first time in a week . :) Haven't decided if I'm going back to sleep or not . If I stay awake then it's going to be = shower , and then more elder scrolls until < PROPFEMALE > gets off at three hours . And then hopefully grocery shopping because the apartment is empty and I'm hungry . 

Fuck < PROPFIRST > 
is currently listening to The War on Errorism 
We don't do drivebys , we park in front of houses and shoot . 
Why is everything so very breakable ? 
Trying not to suck so hard at writing ... 
Why is it that , as a culture , we are more comfortable seeing two men holding guns than holding hands ? - < PROPMALE > Gaines 
Life's but a walking shadow , a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage , and then is heard no more : it is a tale told by an idiot , full of sound and fury , signifying nothing . - Shakespeare/Macbeth 
Epic Fail . 
Watching Skins and reading Aldous Huxley . :) 
What are these strawberries doing on my nipples ? I need them for the fruit salad .... 
Chilling at < PROPFIRST>'s 
Wading my way through Wuthering Heights 
Might as well not exist 
Is actually enjoying Wuthering Heights . Go figure . 
Hungry . ): Watching Supernatural . (: 
watching Jean-claude < PROPFIRST > damme :) 
Dyyyyying . In spite of things , that should make my life decisions a great deal easier . :D 
watching Juno . and not dying quite as much . 
Guess what I want to see . The men who stare at Goats . Because < PROPMALE > Bridges is pretty much God incarnate . And about to eat soup and then go to walmart to buy mooooore medication . This sickness is taking way too long to blow over >.< 
Can we pretend I'm amazing ? Instead of what we both know ... 
Watching Queer as Folk :) 
Totally did not find Paranormal Activity scary >.< Perhaps giggling offsets terror ... 
Writing essays for money FTW 
Happy Days is pure win 
Gonna eat a banana . And then --- time for some hardcore cleaning . 
Got a B on a college paper :D 
So my teeth are decayed . And they hurt . >.< 
Vampire Diaries delivered the greatest angst . It was so beautiful . I almost cried . :D 
Spent my first night at a bowling ally without bowling . Got tipsy . :D Horror marathon tomorrow for halloween with Chelsi <3 so looking through my supernatural dvds 
Awesome weekend with < PROPFEMALE > , Chelsi , < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > . Passed out for most of the day today . Computer keyboard isn't working though , and it pisses me off how I seem incapable of sustaining a keyboard . 
Has money :D 
hmmmmm fried chicken :D 
Finally bought < PROPFEMALE > of the damned . Plus --- bought We the living . And since Ayn Rand's pretty amazing ... I'm sure it's gonna be an amazing book . 
With < PROPFIRST>'s help , I've devised the perfect plot :D 
Maybe teaching third graders the bible as fact isn't the best idea . < PROPFEMALE > cocked her head in confusion at the thought of a pregnant virgin lol . 
Feels capable of creating a novel this time (: Wish me luck , since we all know how extremely short my attention span has become . 
The pretty guy who plays < PROPFIRST > on True Blood is on this episode of < PROPFIRST > <3 Him swearing he's not a killer shouldn't look as hot as it does lol 
I just poured my heart out in an email to my grandmother . And that novel idea sounds even better now . So I'm just gonna keep talking to people until the novel writes itself :D 
Watching Greese 2 . Bad in a pretty bomb way . Cleaning to do - I might actually do it this time . Hopefully frappeuchino later . Had a good night with Chelsi last night . :) Inglorious Bastards was pretty amazing . 
Feels depressed . Contemplating going for a walk . And crawling in a hole and dying . 
Turns out -- might actually go to college . But right now my stomach is consuming itself in silent , but painful protest . So i'm gonna go eat some oatmeal . Also - I kinda wish I lived in a utopian experiment . Call me a socialist - but it kinda made sense ... 
Officially gonna see Ninja Assassin . In two weeks . But right now , I'm baking cookies (: 
Irritated . I hate being irritated , but it feels like it happens so fucking often . Another day wasted , but I'm gonna write tonight . Probably all night . It'll only matter to me . 
Going to do college shit tomorrow . But right now ? I'm indulging my intelligence and watching power rangers . Very old school power rangers . 
Made my first hamburger today . I was so amaze that it wasn't just edible , but tasted good - that I didn't realize I forgot to add cheese until I was done eating it XD 
I cut my finger cutting tomatoes >.< Story of my life . Got college application and course book . Eaaaaasiest college to get into . No wonder half my graduating class chose heartland ... 
bought light bulbs ... we were down to one room with a light ... 
Supernatural = pure win :D 
Annoyed . 
Annoyance turned to pissed the fuck off . I hate being mad - I always end up taking it out on people who don't deserve it . Basically my mother . So I've turned that irritated numbness to writing . 
I killed my charging cord . So my computer usage is very limited >.< Until christmas . FML . 
Watching the < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > reunion <3 
1:30 am and I've decided to revise my fanfiction and maybe put out something new . I haven't written shit since July >.< 
Intends to utilize < PROPFEMALE>'s facilities and take a bath . The first time in like , ever . :D 
Is not going to see new < PROPFEMALE > tonight . Instead , I'm watching vampire diaries and supernatural . I'm also looking up torture techniques for fun , so suck on that twitards . 
TVD update : As opposed to choosing between elena/stefan/damon and caroline/damon , I've decided I'd like to see Jeremy/Tyler . 
Bouts to go see the Invention of Lying at the dollar theater with Chelsi :) 
So ... I'm officially gonna get some < PROPFIRST > mouse ears from disneyland :D 
When I'm done coloring this Spongebob picture , I'mma take a shower and then clean . Got shit to do before thanksgiving >.< but first ... coloring :D 
Thanksgiving's kinda a waste of time . Spent yesterday cleaning and right now - < PROPFEMALE>'s telling me about sex and how she's not gonna get drunk again . Just pot for that one . And now we're onto video games ? wtf ? I'm tired :( But it's off to grandmother's house we go . 
Beeeing productive with the turkey and the potatoes and green stuff . :) The house smells good . Right now I'm reading depressing Death Note fanfiction <3 The dining room is the cleanest it's been in the last decade ... 
I am currently wat < PROPFEMALE > g a show about Dracula on the chiller channel . I just watched Vlad Drakula hammer a nail into another guy's head , until it came out of his < PROPFEMALE > . We should take tips from him for our capital punishment ... fucking painless executions my ass . :D 
Don't think I'd ever be desperate enough for cheap shit to go shopping at six in the morning . 
However , now that I'm awake , and it is friday , it's time to arrange my plans to see ninja assassin this weekend . Chelsi ! Where you at ? 
So , I just colored like an entire coloring book . I need ... a life . Right now , I'm watching < PROPFIRST > Hood on the BBC < PROPFEMALE > . Did they really kill < PROPMALE > of < PROPFIRST > ? Really ? Jeez Luiz I don't remember that part of the book :( Good news tho - < PROPFIRST > Fry will be on the next < PROPMALE > Norton episode :D 
I got presentssss from Disney world . :D 
< PROPFEMALE>'s pretty lethal with her ipod applications ... 
So fucking listless >.< 
Cleaned < PROPFEMALE>'s apartment . For moneeeeey . And a frappeuchino :) Because that's how I roll . 
is about to take a really long , scalding hot shower at two in the morning . And then I'm gonna go to bed . And wake up tomorrow to listen to mother bitch . And clean . fml . Perhaps this is what the masses kill themselves over . They look out into the sky and realize that they absolutely serve no purpose . There are particles of dust and rock formations , out in the galaxy , that are more important than they are . F.M.L. 
It's snoooooowing . :) 
It's snoooooowing :) And I'm watching G.I. < PROPFEMALE > <3 
So I'm about to embark on constructing a semi intelligent work of fiction while rocking out to soulja boy . (: 
It's snowing :) Which is much lovelier than rain . 
Watching Friday night lights DVD . Satellite is out again . 
Epicly failing at detiling the dining room . >.< Um , lets never do this again k ? Tomorrow I'm helping my mommy retile the dining room . And then hopefully catching a movie at the dollar theater . I'm thinking Stepfather . 
I'm writing . :) And even while I write , I acknowledge that how I'm writing at this exact moment in time is not nearly as good as I used to write ... :( wtf ? It's okay though , I'm gonna revise the fuck out of it . 
We are what we pretend to be , so we must be careful what we pretend to be - < PROPMALE > Vonnegut 
It's time for some epic cleaning to Eminem (: I think it's about time to potty train all the cats . Or lock them outside . 
Spent five hours in a car , and we didn't even leave the city lol . Had fun with < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE > :) Now I'm tired and hungry and watching Whose line is it anyway ? Americanized . :D 
is watching < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST>'s weapons of mass destruction on HBO 
Has decided to watch Lost . And is burning up . Is this really what it feels like to have heat in the house ? I don't like it .... 
Chilling at < PROPFEMALE>'s this week . Watching Home Improvement right now :) and eating oreooooos 
Got a new cord for my computer . Oh how I've missed it . :D 
Watching Vampire Diaries until it's time to go .... shopping ! See , I can sound like an excitable teenage girl too . But seriously . I'm going shopping . And I'm gonna buy < PROPFEMALE > . Because deep down but really on the surface , I'm a fatass . 
My stomach won't shut the fuck up . < PROPFEMALE > gets off in half an hour , then we're going to walmart . And then I get to < PROPFEMALE > out with < PROPFIRST > all night . And then back to < PROPFEMALE>'s to house sit tomorrow . :DDD 
fucccked up . and eating a brownie :DDDDDDDDDD 
Eating soup and playing xbox . :) 
Fuuun night with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > . Now - at nine forty , I think it's time to pass out lol 
Hungry but my teeth are killing me >.< 
The pain in my teeth have gone down to a dull roar . So now I'm eating all of < PROPFEMALE>'s food because I'm starving . Just talked to my mommy for the first time in like three days . :) 
sick D: 
Watching < PROPFEMALE > play Modern warfare 2 . About to clean her apartment . But I think I'm gonna eat first . 
I haven't felt like eating in like five days now lol . Maybe it's just an aftershock from strept throat . Hopefully we're off to shope for N64 games later , but right now I'm listening to savage and watching < PROPFEMALE > play Modern warfare 2 . Just finished a supernatural marathon :DDD 
My stomach is a greedy bitch . It's never satisfied . So right now it's pretty much combusting with lack of food . I should probably go to bed , because I don't feel like eating . But I'm gonna watch < PROPMALE > Fillion instead in Castle . 
Really tired of being annoyed . Might just go back to sleep . 
Watching Gossip Girl . Yeah , I've sunk that low . But < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > has a guest spot and I do love meh some < PROPFIRST > humphrey .... I just haven't watched it all season and I dunno what's going on , but I doubt gossip girl will prove very confusing ... 
I get to buy Elder scrolls tomorrow for the xbox . Which is like four years in waiting :) But I get to buy it . And play it alllll day tomorrow :) 
Is it odd that married with children actually reminds me of my parents ...? 
Hungry . :( I think its about time for some more Oblivion . 
I'm also following Mischa Collins on Twitter . And ... he seems more Godlike now than ever . <3 
Heroes aren't born . They're cornered . 
Exciteable people annoy me . Watching Supernatural . The episode's called roadkill and I'm pretty positive I haven't seen it before . :DDDD 
Hold the phone , people . < PROPFEMALE>'s driving a cobalt . 
Watching < PROPMALE > Lowe on Conan O'brien . 
< PROPFEMALE > is singing Wicked at me . -_- 
Um what ? I cunt understand you . Speak English . Pronunciate your words . Making the general sound of what the word may or may not be just isn't working anymore ..... and it makes you sound like a fucking monkey . Stop that . 
I think it's time I adopt a project ... 
The bird's delirium does not interest the tree . So shut the fuck up . Is basically the gist of what Henri Michaux was trying to convey . 
The best thing about my neighborhood is that I can blast hardcore rap without anyone bitching . 
Shhhh ! This is a library ! 
So I kept getting woken up by my pregnant and possibly in labor cat all night . But now I think it's time for some pancakes and Rise Against to brighten up the day . 
Got bit by a dog last night and bled all night -_- um , i don't think that's normal . Woke up to a swollen and bloody hand . Today is gonna be awesome , I can tell .. 
Cleaning house ; uncharacteristically optimistic . 
It's pretty bad when you start to correlate My Sister's keeper with your father's not even close to as fatal situation . 
Watching < PROPFEMALE > dance to thriller XD 
< PROPFEMALE > even fails at eating an ice cream cone . 
So I took too many painkillers . Puked . Twice . And then .... I made the greatest snickerdoodle cookies of my life . 
Megan : suck on my gauze ! ( Thrusting motion and a roll of gauze aimed appropriately ) 
...... uh . Did you just teehee at me ...? 
So basically , my nine year old sister found the fireworks ' impressive ' . And then she informed us that the Earth is slowly dying because of us and shooting fire up into the sky just doesn't seem very smart . Earlier today this chick was watching plants and seeds and shit ' germinate ' on teh telly . The . Fuck . ? 
Don't you sometimes wish you could spend your entire life in the car , trapped inside the too loud and too vulgar music filling the empty spaces between bodies ; not thinking at all ? Driving nowhere , aimless , never really reaching a destination , and satisfied with just that for the first time in your life . 
< PROPFIRST > St. Cloud makes me feel like a horrible sibling . 
Yeah , I laugh when I call you a slut . It's funny . 
Facebook is not twitter . You do not need to update your status ten times in one hour just to post the lyrics to a song . The fuck . 
Catching up on True Blood and waiting for < PROPFEMALE > to get off work in an apartment that I just cleaned . :) 
Mother is seriously encrouching on my not sick induced glee . 
I'll give you a papercut , you little bitch . Fuck with me ! 
Chelsi : Is gangle a cross between gaggle and gang ? Like some thug geese or something ? 
For want of a celebration we forget the blood we have shed to claim it . This thanksgiving , let's remember at what cost we've gained our comfortable lives and pretend like we actually care , shall we ? 
If you weren't alive , nobody would notice . Gee . Thanks . 
Fixing to fall asleep to Rent . 
Gossip girl ? Gossip girl ! Haven't watched that in a while ! - uh , that would be my father .
