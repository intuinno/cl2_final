Had so much fun taking professional pictures with my papi for the first time today and I must say it was an awesome experience that I never thought I would enjoy like this =D <3 

Just got back from a nice long walk around the St. Johns river with Mrs. < PROPMALE > and is so happy that F.Y.E actually sells MJ posters now =D So I bought all 4 with a couple of magazines of him too ! Now i'm spending another night at Mrs. < PROPMALE > s place , and 
feels so bad now , i truely dont want my papi 2 do that 4 me again cause he's already doing so much 4 me ... =( 
Is wanting her papi 2 move down here very soon around fall or hopefully sooner , I pray ... ( HOPEFUL ^-^ ) I Love Him 5-09-09 <3 
Stayed home form work and class 2day . I'm just very sore for some reason ! I want to share my days with only my love * 5-9-09 * 
Doesn't want my baby to get off the phone with me at all ! But i'm being considerate to let him sleep 4 his job in a couple hours =( so i'll hate 4 him to lose more of his sleep 4 me ... I Love Him ... * 5-9-09 * <3 
wishes my papi has time to do the things he says he's going to do ..... it's ok 
Im excited to know that I'll be going to get my laptop later on today =) Im missing my sweetheart , he should always know I truly understand him with all my heart with anything and everything he tells me <3 ~ 5-9-09 ~ 
Happy Birthday < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ... You are sincerely missed by your true fans still , including me </3 ~ 5-9-09 ~ 
I'm so glad that everythings ok now , he truly understands me <3 < PROPMALE > Adames 
Home just resting , thinking of starting the packing of my clothes and getting rid of the ones I don't wear anymore 
About to get ready now to go to the Light Parade tonight . Hoping it will be a whole lot better than last years . 
Watching the < PROPMALE>'s reality show and feeling really sick , maybe a cold =( 
So drowsy from taking that night time theraflu and papi wanting me to stay up to help him pack for his time down here next week with me <3 < PROPFEMALE > Christmas ! 
Today was so awesome with my sweetheart ! Surprised him at the airport and went to so many places with my sister and Christian . So tired now , but can't wait for another day with him ;) <3 
Today is just so unbearable for me to see my sweetheart go . I'm trying to stay strong for the both of us like he wants us both to do , but it's not helping with all these tears coming to me so much . Many unforgettable memories we created together these past two weeks . He always reminds me that it's only the beginning and also getting so much better with time . I love you < PROPMALE > Adames , with all my giving heart <3 
Playing COD with my baby :) <3

Bought \This Is It\ " on Blu-ray and a webcam for my PS3 today =D " 
Time for some serious packing today and tomorrow for Saturdays move to the new house . 
Still trying to look for the right flat screen t.v. for my room , I'm really tired of this box t.v. I had for more than 3 years now . 
Been waiting patiently all morning long for the package that my baby sent out for me . Suppost to be here before 3 today , not sure if thats gonna happen , but will see pretty soon if it does = l 
Just like I thought , didn't recieve that package at all today =/ I hope my sweetheart gets his money back for trying to send it out on this holiday ..... Well , watching WWE Raw now should be good ;)
