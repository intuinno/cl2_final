Getting ready for fair ...... 
Don’t waste a minute not being happy . If one window closes , run to the next window — or break down a door .

Volleyball Game against < PROPMALE > Tommorrow !!!! 
Ugh we lost to < PROPMALE > by 3 points !!!!! 
If winning isn’t everything , why do they keep score ? 
Just got my homecoming dress ..... 
if you want something so bad , close your eye’s , and let yourself have it 
Spirit Week !!!! 
I believe that everything happens for a reason . People change so that you can learn to let go , things go wrong so that you apprieciate them when they’re right , you believe lies so you eventually learn to trust no one but yourself , and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together . 
I think < PROPFIRST > just might kill me but i dont care ...... 
Well our volleyball game pretty much sucked .... 
Homecoming Game tommorrow ....... after a 4 hour practice !!! Eveyone better dress for Crazy Red and White !!!!

Dream as if you'll live forever and live as though you'll die tommorrow . 
I'm officially 15 now .... going to the football games tonight . 
I'm Done . I'm done hurting myself over someone who doesn't care . Someone who for a moment looks then ignores . I'm over him and completly done . He can kiss my ass goodbye because I don't need this . 
Volleyball Tournement in Clinton ..... didn't do so well . Staying the night at Larens ..... 
Finally opened my B-Day presents ...... 
Hahaha WOO HOO ....... no homework !!!!! 
“Accept that you have lost , but never accept that you have failed” 
Practice like you play , Play like you practice 
Many say I am just one to try . I say I am one less to quit 
Dance as though no one is watching , Love as though you have never been hurt , Sing as though no one can hear you , and Live as though you will never live again ! 
really hope we can go skiing , haunted housing , and to st. < PROPFIRST > for 4h 
The pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity , the optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty . 
Happy National 4-H Week !!!!!!!

You have to fight back , No matter what life throws back at you . 
It's been over a month , and the pain is as fresh as the first day 
ugh can't go to Laren's party because i have to babysit .... 
There is a reason your windshield is so big and rear view mirror so small . Were not meant to go backwards 
Leave the crowd , stand apart , ignore your head and follow your heart 
Busy , Busy ! Volleyball game and Orchestra concert tommorrow . Got my dress for the concert .... ugh =( 
things go wrong so that you apprieciate them when they’re right , you believe lies so you eventually learn to trust no one but yourself , and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together 
love others for who they are ... do not love them for what they have 
The football game was boring .... North < PROPFIRST > Invitational tommorrow 
Ugh finals tommorrow , Volleyball banquet , and Saturday Bailee is probably having a party and i can't go cause my mom told the neighbors i would babysitt for them and i REALLY dont want to ......

Congratulations < PROPFEMALE > !!! I hope I get to see the baby soon !! 
Got home from Dubuque .... Good Job at the tournaments West Wrestling !! 
When you walk away , I count the steps that you take ... 
Some people come into our lives and quickly go . Some stay for awhile and leave footprints on our hearts . And we are never , ever the same . 
Friendship is made in the heart , Silent .. Unwritten .. Unbreakable by distance .. Unchangeable by time .. 
Another snow day ... going to Burlington for the boys ' wrestling meet 
Meet at Cedar Rapids Kennedy tommorrow ... 
Going Christmas shopping then to la grandmeres ! 
Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength ; loving someone deeply gives you courage 
I love you , thats all I can say . You confuse me , drive me crazy , piss me off , give me butterflies , and make me smile ... 
if i had to choose between loving you and breathing i would use my last breath to say i love you . 
Being strong sometimes means being able to let go 
Fml , Cailean broke his leg .... 
Finals start tommorrow ! Im nervous and hoping all goes well for everyone !!! 
Cailean and < PROPFEMALE > are finally here !!!! 
boyfriends stab you in the heart , friends stab you in the back , but best friends NEVER < PROPFEMALE > knives ..... its dangerous ! 
The reason people find it so hard to be happy is that they always see the past better than it was , the present worse than it is , and the future less resolved than it will be 
We Wish You a < PROPFEMALE >??•* ¨*• . ¸¸ ? ¸¸ . • *¨* • ?? Christmas ?? • *¨* • . ¸¸ ? ¸¸ . • *¨* • ?? We Wish You a < PROPFEMALE > ?? • *¨* • . ¸¸ ? ¸¸ . • *¨* • ?? Christmas ? ? ?

You think you can beat me ? I think your mama raised a fool 
Sarcasitc ? No . I am far too ditzy to understand the complexitites of mockery ... 
Sarcasm helps keep you from telling people what you really think of them . 
Skypeeee :)

Men are put into this world so women can fix them . :) 
Bored to death 
it sucks when you think you have everything right but its all wrong 
Well ... don't I feel like the biggest bitch in the world .... im so sorry :( 
Listen up guys ! A true love is the person that\ 
loves you because you are you , not the guy next to you . So never \ 
think that you have to change to find her !!! The girl of your dreams\ 
will love you because you are just that . YOU ! 
Is it even humanly possibly for you to be a bigger asshole ? 
Lol had so much fun today ! 
Don't give me a weird look if you don't think i'm normal , becasue believe me , i think your weird to 
Don't write your name in the sand , it will get washed away\ 
Don't write your name in the sky , it will blow away\ 
Write your name in the hearts of the people you meet and that's where it will stay 
Ah well school was pointless today :) 
Ouch !! Sunburns really hurt !! 
This is so complicated !! 
I really hate my english teacher right now

i feel so people deprived ..... 
People often say that ' beauty is in the eye of the beholder , ' and I say that the most liberating thing about beauty is realizing that you are the beholder . This empowers us to find beauty in places where others have not dared to look , including inside ourselves 
Im cooler than a polar bears toes :) ( i love < PROPFIRST > vanwinkles music ) 
Im going to kill itunes 
Who made Wheat Thins so delicious ?? 
Well , today just plain sucked :/

Take that North < PROPFIRST > ! You just got crushed by the FALCON NATION ! 
skype with my girls , < PROPFEMALE > McCreight and < PROPFIRST > VanWinkle :) 
FALCON NATION !!! GO WEST !!! 
Why do some people deny everything , lie about everything , and do things just to get attention ? Ill tell you why , Because they're stupid . Thats why . 
Don't talk to me if you have headphones in ... I won't listen to you because you're not really listening to me :) 
If all of the food on your plate is the same shade of one color , its NOT good for you .... just saying 
Well , looks like this girl is going to North East Goose Lake by herself this weekend . It shouldn't have to be my problem if someone ( whose name I will not mention ) were responsible and took initiative earlier this week . But NO ! We can't all be smart and responsible these days now can we ? 
Well , Bigler was very inspirational today :) 
Its WAY too early to be awake ... 
Yay ! Early out ! 
Hahaha no school tommorrow !!!! 
Shoveling my driveway = no beuno

Not Being Able to go to Volleyball = No Bueno\ 
< PROPFEMALE > McCreight Getting Her License = Bueno \ 
Not Being Able to Read Peoples ' Minds = No bueno\

I just LOVE looking like a hot mess 
It's nights like this that i miss you 
A rule to understanding me : you ignore me , i ignore you 
Hmmm ... what to do , what to do 
All my life I've been good , but now , I'm thinking what the hell ? All I wanna do is mess around ! 
Well .. that was disappointing :( 
What do normal people do when they're bored ? Im way too used to being busy , busy , busy with no time to spare !
