Only 10 more weeks of school ! Then summer ... 
It's snowing .... AGAIN .... cold ... 
WE HAD A SNOW DAY TODAY !!!!! It's nice to be able to sleep in on school days too :) 
Don't you hate how marshmellows melt in hot chocolate ? You can't even enjoy them that way ... 
Last year the USA spent $10 billion dollars changing our cell phone ringtones . That's ridiculous . 
The other day I was walking back to the teachers with the flag and I banged into a pole ... no thanks to < PROPMALE > ... 
I got to teach Math at school for visitation day . It was actually pretty fun until i got home and had to grade everyone's papers ... XD I don't want t be a teacher . 
So like I start playing this game and I find out it takes two days to be ready to harvest crops ... Like why would I get on every two days to pick flowers ?!!!!? 
Well I'm going to my Uncle < PROPMALE>'s house so I won't be on for a while ... Hope I have fun and you guys reading this are having a good time two . 
I finally went shopping for my eigth grade gradation ! I found a ton of awesome dresses but somehow I managed to come home empty handed 
I forgot my phone at school .... Tears ... How will I ever be able to live ?!

I really don't want to go back to school after all this fun time off ... 
5 months and 2 days untill summer vacation ... I can't wait ! 
just finished a science test in school ... Hopefully I can pul an A ? 
It's pouring right now ... I love the rain SO much ... 
thinks today was the most wonderfulest day of my life ... It rained and I got 103.6% on my science test ! Plus also I jumped around in puddles when I got home ... Now I'm SOAKED but hey , it was worth it ! 
I laughed so hard I cried ! 
So like since it's all wet outside I have to go splash in puddles . Barefoot of course ! And I'm walking through this ankle deep irrigation ditch when Alain and < PROPFEMALE > start screaming ... I'm like K will you guys stop yelling and they start pointing to my feet ( I wasn't looking where I was walking ) and saying something about worms . EWWWW !!!! It turns out I waked through like 70 million of them without even knowing ! 
watched Avatar last night . It was on of the most awesome movies I've ever seen in my short life ... 
Back to school ... If only the weekends lasted all my life ... 
A good friend will pick you back up again when you fall ... I'll laugh and trip you again ! 
A true friend will bail you out of jail . Your best friend will be sitting next to you saying , \Boy ! That was fun ! \"" 
Best friends won't let you do stupid thigs ... alone 
A friend will stop you from overreacting ... Your best friend will be giggling , \Someone's gonna get it . \"" 
Somehow I managed to get stuck on the monkeybars at school ... I mean COME ON ! The kindergarteners can get down better than I can ... Anyways , thanx to my bff I'm not still up there ... LOL 
HAHA ! An easy history test ... An oral book report ... How much easier can school get ... Oh and a fraction test ! That's so much easier than slopes ... 
got to the park , started rollerblading , and then realized the entire trail is gravel !

As I was going to St Ives , \ 
I met a man with seven wives , \ 
Each wife had seven sacks ;\ 
Each sack had seven cats ;\ 
Each cat had seven kittens . \ 
Kits , cats , sacks , and wives , \ 
How many were going to St Ives ? \ 
\ 
This is a trick question btw . 
Walked in my room with a cup of water . Put it on my desk , turned on the light and saw a wet patch on my beanbag . Wasn't sure if my cat had peed on it , so I poured some water on it and smelled both of them ... It's not pee ! :D HA !

Today ( while most of you were sleeping :P ) we went on a hike and drove up the moutain . OH ! AND I HAD MINT SYRUP ! Can anyone beat that ? Yeah I didn't think so :P after that I meant a few of < PROPFEMALE>'s friends . They talk like this lskjbonjouraldsfjdfcomoncava ? fsbvjnonsfsdfhsaluefkw anyways ... And I watched a French movie . They don't believe in < PROPFEMALE > tales so everyone died at the end ... HA ! It was kind sad tho ... 
I slap myself ( not literally ) every morning when I wake up and hear strange words coming out of Eloises mouth that are not english ... It always takes me a few seconds to remmember ... 
I went swimming with < PROPFEMALE > in the lake between < PROPFEMALE > and Switerland ... It was great fun even though the water wasn't very deep . I bought some chocolate and we ate it on the ride home . Right now < PROPFEMALE > is making muckedy muck muck as Dad calls it LOL . I'm speaking french much better now I think 
Had a great time in church . Bisous ... Um ... I don't think I know you but OK ... Everyone here is so musically inclined it's amazing . Rite now I'm sitting on a couch listening to Geoffery sing and play the guitar ... And he and his motha just finished playing the piano . And < PROPFEMALE > plays a little guitar , accordian and she's good at piano . 
Hehe we washed the rabbit :) It wasn't as exciting as washing our cat tho ...
