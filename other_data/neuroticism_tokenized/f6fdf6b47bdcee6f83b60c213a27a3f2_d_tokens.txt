watching time blow by with the wind . Eroding the foundation of friends , just too watch as they get feiried away . slowly realising that even the closest of friends AREN'T forever . 
Cohorts arrive who wish to share in their adventure , as do apprentices eager to be trained by such legendary figures . 
quietly sitting at the computer with a thoughtfull look on my face with headphones on . ( the headphones are playing a mass asortment of silenthill music ) 
\Now I lie here in this empty bed and all I think about is you and I wonder if you miss me now and if your bed is empty too\ " ( the cruxshadows ) " 
is realizing jus how sadistic life is , and how far he's fallen into the dark . oddly i like it here even though things are falling apart , light burns too much too take ... 
starting too think he should stop trying to figure things out in life and quit being curious ... cause the more you dig the more pain it causes . 
why cant i be what you want me to be ?... 
one thing you would change about me , GO ! 
rawr , gaming on saturday morning ... its starting too grid to a hault lately 
yay verginity !!!!!!!!!! 
Yo , ho , haul together , hoist the colors high . Heave ho , thieves and beggars , never shall we die . The < PROPMALE > and his men stole the < PROPFEMALE > from her bed and bound her in her Bones . The seas be ours and by the powers where we will we'll roam . 
love doesnt die , it festers . 
* sings * little girl , running away from the world . dont blame your self , words are less than love . ~ in a wonderland you can bend the course of pain , you can find the key and dream the darkness away ~ . 
is a fuck up . the one person in his life that he could be happy with and he threw it away just for some stupid cullinary classes . 
Love me cancerously , like a salt sore soked in the sea . 
have you ever been with someone , and when they left you your body had random convulsions or pain and sadness that made you shake like you're going through a drug withdrawl ? 
< PROPFEMALE > , no fading for you , sit you happy ass back down and talk too me lol . 
i just wish people would tell you too your face how they felt about you . cause this \friend telling you too step off\ " stuff is bull shit . " 
Letting go of the bird that you love more than life is hard ... but once you do it , life feels more free than it ever did before . ( goodbye < PROPFEMALE > , if you ever need a friend , im always here ) 
anyone up for a seppuku ?! =D 
is so tired he feels like he did when the nurses in the hospital put him on that morphine drip . 
i now have my GED , and am pushing forward in life , DONT STOP MY NOW !!!... cause if i do it'll take a while too build up the kenetic energy that it took too get me going again >.< 
i needs job ... badly ... 
apply , apply , apply some more , and yet still no job for me's 
just got a call from Build-a-Bear for a group interview =D hopefully i'll get the job ! ~ 
hitting his head against a wall due too retardedness of life .

how many daggers do you take to the chest before you are able to catch them out of the air ?... 
so i think i have come to the conclusion that im a fungi ... 
Mr President I hear you would like to freeze pay rates for soldiers starting next year . Would you also consider cutting your own pay to save much more money for our country ? While you're at it , lets cut down congressman's pay too . If the people who risk their lives don't get an ... increase in pay , why would we continue raising pay for those who take no risks and reap the benefits ? Keep it going if you agree 
' my mind is just ... boggled by that statement you just made . ' - < PROPMALE > 
i miss having a social life . o-o 
so i have come to the conclusion that im going to get my hair cut , im going to go to great clips and donate it . mind you not all but everything from the shoulders down , which is at least a foot and maybe four inches . lest people think i should cut it shorter , let the votes begin . 
i am known as , Valentinez Alkalinella Xifax Sicidabohertz Gombigobilla Blue Stradivari Talentrent < PROPMALE > Andri Charton-Haymoss Ivanovici Baldeus < PROPFIRST > ? Doitzel Kaiser the third .

a coward is someone who runs from their fears , but the diffrence between a coward and a curagious man isnt that they dont fear anything at all , its that they face that fear head on knowing full well they may come true
