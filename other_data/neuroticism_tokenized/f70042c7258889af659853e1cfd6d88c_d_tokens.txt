I am now a member of Mt . Pleasant Baptist Church in Carrollton , GA . 

I woke up today and for this I am blessed . I have a wonderful family for this I am blessed . I deserve nothing but God gives me the desires of my heart . 
I have prayed and I believe , Now I am ready to receive ; Oh lord rain on me 
I go walking , walking with the lord on my knees . 
What a day that's gonna be when my jesus I shall see 
Happy Birthday to me , Happy Birrthday to me 
Seems that < PROPFEMALE > is in a state of Apostasy . The thing is What are we to do . When the leaders and teachers or telling us to be what we want to be . We should be seeking Gods will in our lives and depend on The comfort of our Heavenly Father . I pray that all of you will Seek the face of God . 
When you feel that your prayers are not being answered , Stop and ask GOd what sins have you not confessed . When we are in line with God then and only then will God give us the desires of our heart . 
I spent a great deal of time doing what ever I wanted and seemed to always fail . I learned in the book of < PROPFIRST > that it is imperative that . We take all sins before God . ask him to show you the sins of your life and as he does Confess and Repent . 
It is not enough to just Say to God I am sorry for the Sins I have done . Name them for what they are do not bundle them up as if they are the same . Each sin is a burden that keeps you from a blessings God wants you to receive . 
To repent is not the same as to Confess . repent is the walking away from to turn against and reconize the damage it is causing . 
If you learn all of this and take in all the knowledge of God as he gives it to you and do nothing with it you are but a dead sea . The dead sea has no outlet it can not empty its self therefore can not be filled any more than it is . We are commanded by God to be fruitful and grow . 
Tell someone how to be saved and teach someone what it is to be Christian . Do not beafraid to use your on testimony to show gods mercy and love . 
< PROPFIRST > was the first one to < PROPFEMALE > the Gospel

Practicing Theology \ 
Our lives reflect our theology , our theology reflects our knowledge of God -- what are our lives telling others about God ? 
Car Dieu a tant aimé < PROPFEMALE > monde qu'il a donné son Fils unique pour mourir sur la croix pour nos péchés . 
Denn also hat Gott die Welt geliebt , daß er seinen eingeborenen Sohn am Kreuz für unsere Sünden sterben 
Perché Dio ha tanto amato il mondo da dare il suo Figlio unigenito a morire sulla croce per i nostri peccati . 
Sic enim Deus dilexit mundum quod dedit unigenitum ad mortem crucis pro peccatis nostris .
