I've been up for hours but I still haven't gotten out of bed because I've been lazing around watching shit on Netflix with my iPhone . Have I mentioned that I love this thing ? 
Saw Beastly today . It was funny ( especially the parts NPH was in ) and cute and fluffy aka totally unlike the novel . Still enjoyed it though . 
Goddamn it . More snow ? I thought we were done with this shit . 
Watching CSI : Miami to get in the mood for my road trip . I've noticed that the crimes are more horrific in this series . Perhaps to distract from Caruso's ridiculous ' acting' ? 
Fuck you and all your snow , < PROPMALE > . Miami here I come ! 
< PROPMALE > has the amazing ability to spot ANYTHING phallic in nature . 
Finally hit Florida ! Now we just have to get all the way down to Miami .
