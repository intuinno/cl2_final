Happy are those who dream dreams and are ready to pay the price to make them come true . 
It's a slow fade when you give yourself away , It's a slow fade when black and white have turned to gray , Thoughts invade , choices are made , a price will be paid , When you give yourself away , People never crumble in a day , Daddies never crumble in a day , Families never crumble in a day

I won't be your hero , I won't be your superman . Everything I did was for you , everything you said was a lie . My pain , your gain , who's your hero today ? 
Passing this along to everyone : IMPORTANT !! HACKER ON FB !! A friend sent me this and I did it an sure enough the same person was on mine .. try it and see if they are on yours ..

IN MEMORY of all babies born sleeping or whom we have carried , but never met , or held in our arms . Make this your profile status if you or someone you know has suffered the loss of a baby . The majority won't do it , because unlike cancer , baby loss is still a taboo subject . Break the silence . In Memory of all Angel Babies , gone too soon , but never forgotten . 
chillin at my moms . then back home tomorrow . i need this stability in my life these days . 
still at my moms . i might make it home tomorrow . got to take my lil brother bowling yay

Those who mind dont matter , and those who matter don't mind . the lesson here ? if someone is on you about what you are doing they dont matter but if they accept you then they shouldnt mind . Grow up people for real ... you are out of high school and want to be grown so act like it
