... there's nothing like the satisfaction that comes with a fully stocked refrigerator . 
has Skype now : norm32991 . 
HOUSE ! 
... He's taking steps in the right direction , and is committed to < PROPFEMALE > . President Obama has proposed progressive , if unconventional , ideas , and I think he deserves the unconventionally awarded prize . On an unrelated note , go Rebels ! 
has a student ticket to tomorrow's football game that he no longer needs . 
... Saw < PROPFEMALE > ... 
... there are definitely some words that are definitely overused . Definitely . 
If President Obama intercepts your football pass in a commercial ... it is truly a great commercial . That caught me off guard . 
from FMyLife : Today , I had one more gift to buy : a copy of ' Fight Club ' . I asked a person working at Best Buy if they had any in stock . The man wouldn't sell me the last copy because I had broken the first two rules . FML 
I've got oxycodone , cepahexin , ibuprofen , an ice pack , one less wisdom tooth , and Season 1 of House MD . What a day .

Hey Duke : COCKY much !? Time for an exorcism on the court ! 
so ... I donated to Relay For Life at the RC at the promise of a shirt . Apparently said shirts have arrived and I have yet to receive it . Does it make me a bad person to make demands either for the shirt or my money ? 
just got quite a mature feeling from deleting his Myspace < PROPFEMALE > .

Yeah , I'm coming home in a week , and I'm bringing the Rebel with me !

Well , < PROPMALE > County ... it looks like I have much to catch up on while I'm here . 
Can no longer say , \Never have I ever broken a bone . \"" 
Broke my arm last night . I was driving our dune buggy and attempted to drift in it . Still at UofL hospital . 
Yay morphine ! 
Surgery tomorrow morning ... just call me Iron Man ! 
surgery completed yesterday . Now I have a steel support for my elbow and a high heart rate ( 110 ~ 130 ) even at rest . 
A nurse who saw me leaving the hospital thought I was a celebrity .

Sometimes I just wanna copy someone else's status , word for word and see if they notice . 
First full day as an intern for Ole Miss Sports ! 
Coach Nutt and < PROPMALE > Masoli are pleading for his eligibility . 
Good to know that my shiny new metal implants , in fact , do not set off airport metal detectors . 
the only upside to the Rebels losing yesterday is ... I wasn't there to see it . Thankfully . 
oh , that's why ... just learned that I'm a fusion of man and titanium ... and titanium doesn't set off metal detectors . 
Hey ! You there ! 
literally every single time I've done laundry this year , I've ended up with new clothing , which usually appears in the form of socks that I'm sure are made for women . 
My spanish professor just told me I looked like her favorite golfer . I can guarantee her favorite golfer isn't Vijay Singh . 
Go support Ole Miss Volleyball ! If you can't , catch the televised broadcast ! I'll be there bringing play by play commentary ( My first time ! )

Actually , 812 , I've decided to remain in the 662 for now . Nothing personal , but I'm needed here . 
If you're in Oxford , and not at either the Volleyball or the Soccer match , I have one question : Why not ? 
As I have been told by < PROPFEMALE > Seratt , < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > will be in the Grove at 11am . 
First fire alarm of the year ... who really needs popcorn at 12:35 ? 
I love Ole Miss , but I'm certainly not thrilled about a bear . 
Hey , prez . Love you , man ... but I'm not about to miss class for you . 
Also ... Hey , < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > , since when is an awkwardly-uttered grunt an acceptable adlib in a song's intro ? 
plans on dressing up as Kanye for Halloween and then when the kids yell “Trick or treat , ” jump out of the bushes and yell “I’mma let you finish but Christmas is one of the best holidays of all time ! ” 
Sorry refs ... we don't have money in our budget to pay you . We're busy building a law school ... irony ? 
FaceTime for < PROPMALE > ? ... sure , why not .

I asked the librarian today where to find the self-help section , but she said it would defeat the purpose . 
Nelly ... on ESPN ... complaining about not being on BET's top 10 rappers , while the rest of us wonder if Ole Miss will win this weekend . I know my priorities .

Ever seen a tweaker play pool ? He hits the cue ball maybe twice , leaves the room with the pool stick , then comes back some arbitrary time later and just tries to push all the balls in with his hands . Also , he's wearing sunglasses inside . At 12am . 
Only in Times Square ... does Burger < PROPMALE > sell alcohol . 
Waking up at 1pm on the first day back home over the break : Glorious . 
Looks like the man-metal fusion might be dissolved . Second doctor is eager to remove the plates . 
Our dogs like to fight , so we were naturally worried when Brantley found blood on the pavement . Turns out the blood was menstrual . 
Just saw a robbery at St. < PROPFIRST>'s Mall . The guy took off with this girl's purse—running surprisingly fast for having to hold up his pants—and bolted in his car . Of course , it was parked in preparation for a getaway , and the windows were tinted to probably an illegal degree . \ 
Goooo Louisville ! Cards won , and a criminal made his escape in terrible holiday traffic . Somehow .

Face tats ? I wonder how much you have to like ice cream to have it take up half your face . 
< PROPFEMALE > is a country where half the money is spent buying food , and the other half is spent trying to lose weight . 
Ever wonder about those people who spend $2.00 a piece on those little bottles of Evian water ? Try spelling Evian backwards . 
So ... someone decided it would be funny to empty my body wash . And it wasn't my roommate . And there's limited access to my room . Haha . 
If you kill time , expect it to seek revenge . 
I think , you know ... just for fun ... Ole Miss should procure a black ( brown ) bear ( from Louisiana ) and just set it loose . It would be quite a story : \There's a bear roaming around somewhere ... just so you know . \"" 
I woke up in the middle of the night , only to find myself rambling ... in spanish . 
If you're going to have your mom do your laundry , please have her take it home . The rest of us college students need those washing machines . 
Okay ... this speaker in my class has a legitimate handlebar mustache . The ends curl up and don't even touch his face . 
Okay , here's a service announcement for people who like to smoke pot just before going to class : We can smell you .
