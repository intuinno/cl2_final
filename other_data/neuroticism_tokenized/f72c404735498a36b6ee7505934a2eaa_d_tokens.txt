had the worst day . All cried out now . Goodnight . 
Happy Stardate 11001.01 
got behind the wheel of a car for the first time today . Turns out driving is a lot like marching . Going backwards is terrifying and you just have to keep telling yourself there's ground beneath your feet . 
A . You're gay B . You've got a girlfriend C . You kinda thought I came on too strong or D . I just wasn't your thing no ring Hey Boy Why you didn't call me ? I waited for days I can't believe you didn't call When we sat outside for an hour at the party and talked I thought something good could be starting It's not a lot that I want just some talking 
made in his image , a mannequin merely to madden it- POE 
* Play me a sad song ' Cause that’s what I want to hear I want you to make me cry I know that you’ll go soon You’ll find out so take me with you always*-AuRevoirSimone

needs some peice of mind . Wishes we could go back . Prays things will be different . 
Lorelai : How does < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > screw up your REM sleep ? Luke : Because he's always got some guy on pushing a book about how everything's all going to hell , or they're going to pass a law , how everyone with a nose ring is going to get shipped off to < PROPFEMALE > . Suddenly you're depressed , thinking we're all going to die and don't drink the water , there's anthrax in my bagel - and bam , there goes your REM sleep . 
* Fool , I wonder if you know yourself at all You know that it could be so simple * 
rabble rabble rabble rabble 
* I was sitting on the fence And I thought that I would kiss you I never thought I would've missed you But you never let me fall Push my back against the wall Every time you call You get so emotional Oh , I'm freakin ' out *

* take me for what i am who i was meant to be and if you give a damn take me baby or leave me * 
For oft when on my couch I lie , in vacant or in pensive mood , they dance upon the inward eye . Which is , the bliss of solitude . And then my heart with pleasure fills , and dances with the daffoldils . 
can hardly wait for tomorrow . In 43 minutes it will be Saturday June 20th and he should come pick me up right then and give me a big hug .

I don't need an alibi or for you to realize , The things we left unsaid , Are only taking space up in our heads . 
Quid pro quo . i guess I'm still looking for somone I can watch the sunset with .... 
* You should know , that I have no heart . Oh I have one to be shot or stabbed in , no doubt , and if it should cease to beat I should cease to be , but , you know what I mean , I have no softness there , no sympathy , sentiment . * 
excellent night last night . Your voice is like a combination of Fergie and Jesus ! Of Transformers ? Longest movie EVER . Especially at midnight with a bunch of chris-farley-haters and a piece of old gum . When Optimus Prime died I almost cried . Just like Muf

Well I don't know what I'm looking for But I know that I just wanna look some more And I won't be satisfied ' Till there's nothing left that I haven't tried For some people it's an easy choice But for me there's a devil and an angel's voice

* Ask me how do I feel Ask me now that we're cosy and clinging Well sir , all I can say , is if I were a < PROPFEMALE > I'd be ringing ! * 
* Well if I was in your position Id put down all my ammunition I'd wondered why'd it taken me so long But Lord knows that I'm not you And If I was I wouldn't be so cruel Cause waiting on love ain't so easy to do * 
yay for insomnia ....

posted new photos from journalism camp ! check them out ! 
suddenly I see this is what I want to be , why the hell it means so much to me . 
* From its place on the mantel my heart was taken down scattered in a thousand little pieces on the ground and I below the streetlamp like an orphan with a halo Darlin ' do not fear what you don't really know ' cause it won't last worries'll pass all y 
* No , this is how it works You peer inside yourself You take the things you like And try to love the things you took And then you take that love you made And stick it into some Someone else's heart Pumping someone else's blood And walking arm in arm You ho

* Wave your little hand and whisper So long dearie You ain't gonna see me anymore But when you discover that your life is dreary Don't you come a knockin ' at my door For I'll be all dolled up And singin ' that song That says you dog , I told you so So wave y

\so ..... danielle ..... how'd you break your leg ? \ " hahaha " 
* Don't cry Don't raise your eye It's only teenage wasteland The exodus is here The happy ones are near Let's get together Before we get much older . * 
* Behind mock-ceremony of your grief Lurked the burlesque instinct of the ham ; You never altered your amused belief That life was a mere monumental sham . From the comic accident of birth To the final grotesque joke of death Your malady of sacrilegious mirt 
is re-reading Cat's Cradle ; religion is not the only opiate of society . 
* Dig if you will the picture , of you and I engaged in a kiss . Can you my darling , can you picture this ? Dream if you can , a courtyard : an ocean of violets in bloom . Animals strike curious poses They can feel the heat , the heat between me and you . * 
* I was out of your league , and you were 20,000 underneath the sea : waving affections . You were out of my league , at a distance that I didn't want to see , down at the bottom . I wanted a junction , and often there was one . You'd surface face first and we'd s 
so , people are selling marijuana out of ice cream trucks , operating strip clubs from Subway restaruants , and eating chocolate covered bacon ?! 
just finished watching the original Exorcist . I'd venture to say it's better than the original Omen even . Projectile vomiting ? YES . 
* Don't look for shooting stars , for love is only love . You touch and still you touch the ground . Don't listen for those bells , for love is only love , and if it's love you've found your heart won't hear a sound . And when you hold his hand , you only hold his hand . The violins are all a bluff , but if you're really wise the silence of his eyes will tell you love is only love and it's wonderful enough * 
loves dogs : Outside of a dog , a book is a man’s best friend . Inside of a dog it’s too dark to read . 
* Oh Fox News , does the sun ever shine during a Democratic administration ? Now , with Obama in office , when babies laugh do you hear only the sound of kittens drowing ? * - < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE >

Half religious zealouts wanting to control every breath every citizen takes and half ego-anarchist libertarian cowboys shrilling for no government ! McCarthyism , Watergate , < PROPFIRST > Buchanan , < PROPFIRST > Bush ! Objectively speaking : a wrong bunch . They make no sense ! * 
* Harper Pitt : It's terrible . Mormons are not supposed to be addicted to anything . I'm a Mormon . Prior Walter : I'm a homosexual . Harper Pitt : Oh . In my church , we don't believe in homosexuals . Prior Walter : In my church , we don't believe in Mormons . *

* I'm sorry for the mess The stupid way I'm dressed I guess I failed my test Oh don't you know I'm sorry for my views I musta been confused And yet you know that really I'm sorry for you * 
anyone want to see Taxidermia with me this weekend ? 
went to the park to shoot some things with < PROPMALE > :) at his house now , txt

There's only one thing that I know how to do well , and I've often been told that you only can do what you know how to do well , and that's be you , be what you're like , be like youself . So I'm having a wonderful time but I'd rather be whistling in the dark .

You're the dream I've been waiting for . Stop beating yourself down , there's no reason . t's not that I'm blind , it's that I can see so much more than everyone else .

That time is the happiest I can ever remember being , the most I have ever smiled , and the greatest extend to which my heart has ever swelled .
