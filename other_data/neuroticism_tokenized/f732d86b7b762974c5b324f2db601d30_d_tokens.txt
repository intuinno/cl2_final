Life is meaningless ! Chaos ! The universe has no center ! The creator is a drooling idiot ! 
TAKE WHAT YOU CAN ! GIVE NOTHING BACK ! 
the beast is the beast let it run free 
Become the animal you are meant to be not the shell of a human that everyone expects you to be . 
I'm beaten down again , I belong to them\ 
Beaten down again , I've failed you\ 
I'm weaker now my friend , I belong to them\ 
Beaten down again , I've failed you

Fools rush in where Angels fear to tred 
strung out on 12 cups of coffee 3 energy drinks no sleep crazy day pain the ass family all an all cant wait to see what happens next 
Take what you can give nothing back .

Shadow Strike Mewtwo 
I'm at a lost . Don't know no more . Not sure of anything . Wonder if there really is a good ending . But which road to take . I ponder on all this but get lost in the void and wonder if I can escape . 
I feel it deep within , it's just beneath the skin\ 
I must confess that I feel like a monster\ 
I hate what I've become , the nightmare's just begun\ 
I must confess that I feel like a monster 
havin me some fun tonight

Let's see how creative my Facebook friends are ... Leave me a 1-word comment that best describes me using the THIRD letter of YOUR FIRST Name ... It can only be 1 word ... Then copy and paste this to your wall so I can leave a word about you ... Don't just post a word & not copy , that's no fun . :)
