Looking for a better job !!!!! 

frustrated with passwords 
Taking < PROPFEMALE > out tonight for St. < PROPFIRST>'s Day . Yay ! Green Sprite . lol . Hope to see some friends tonight 
\We have fallen in love with the body . That's that thing that looks back at us from the mirror . That's the repository of that lovely identity that you keep chasing all your life . \ " < PROPFIRST > Wald " 
' Loneliness , insomnia , and change : the fear of these is even worse than the reality . ' ~ Mignon McLaughlin , The Second Neurotic's Notebook , 1966 T.T 
I'm finally on meds , things are better ; i just don't know why i feel depressed . 
\The world needs anger . The world often continues to allow evil because it isn't angry enough . \"~ Bede < PROPMALE > \ 
Why does the wind blow at such funny angles , \ 
where may emotions sway with such a breeze\ 
where my heart can ache at the pain of another\ 
do i feel to much , or just too deeply\ 
for those who are great\ 
for those who glow with such bright light\ 
i wish to speak love , but that word so mis-taken\ 
so misunderstood\ 
i say it freely now\ 
i love you , i love you great and i love you deeply\ 
i simply just\ 
love you 
Part 1\ 
lonely , am i , between every beat of my heart\ 
silence that comes and goes\ 
reminds me of silence from you\ 
light remains , glowing , flickering\ 
casting shadows upon our memories\ 
shining upon tomorrows dawn\ 
the hearts rhythem doesnt change 
Part 2\ 
lonely , am i , between my breaths\ 
still , unmoving , as love is\ 
the sea swells , ice runs across my feet\ 
it travels up my spine , like the warmth from you once did\ 
this sea is boiling compared to your touch\ 
as i sit and ponder\ 
lonely , for so long though\ 
the sun is rising\ 
perhaps love is too 
My Body(part 2)\ 
My nails , long and smooth\ 
Leaving ghost trails down your back\ 
You shiver and sway\ 
Like the natural rhythm of my hips\ 
Lastly , as I walk away , you notice what moves me\ 
Long and slender , like porcelain my legs\ 
As you finally take me all in , \ 
I’m to far away\ 
You never spoke , just watched\ 
My body 
My Body(part 1)\ 
I walk , I see you watch me\ 
Your eyes devour\ 
My hair , red like the fire of my soul\ 
My eyes , deep blue and warm\ 
Windows to my heart\ 
Wish to swim ? \ 
You follow my breath\ 
Your eyes , rise and fall 
I can feel my blood flow\ 
between your fingers , \ 
as you hold my heart to yours\ 
you breath and steal mine\ 
intertwined and falling\ 
speak , so words may pass my lips\ 
cry and i can feel your joy\ 
love then i may feel\ 
your blood between my fingers 
i am so full of poetry !! ^.^ 
the winds have chnged again\ 
leaves fall and your scent passes\ 
tails twitch , growling quietly\ 
old friends , new paths\ 
daylight fades\ 
until another day 
waiting for the breeze to come\ 
to smell your scent once more\ 
yonder fields where old hearts roam\ 
and memories from yore\ 
sighing to encourage wind\ 
< PROPFEMALE > coming to an end 
caught between the winds again\ 
the branches sway\ 
the fields shiver\ 
in between the two\ 
i look for a river 
Tired , -hangs head- wow . 
Timid little creature\ 
standing in a clearing\ 
if only one could reach her\ 
to show a world with out fearing\ 
i wish to take her by the hand\ 
show her lovely things across the land\ 
if only i could touch her\ 
if she'd let some one love her\ 
such a lovely timid creature\ 
if only one could meet her 
excerpt from journal :\ 
i will get back to the sexual , sensual < PROPFEMALE > i once was . i will walk down the street and be that draw dropping beauty that nearly stops traffic . i will become the woman that into a room and even the woman will stare . i will be that innocent , free spirit that has a dark side . i will be the wet dream you wish you had . 
journal entry part two :\ 
i will become that woman again i am a woman of power , of class , a woman \ 
that knows who she is and who you want to be , i will be that woman \ 
again . i may have been torn down , 
part three :\ 
but the best thing about rebuilding is\ 
you can rebuild better the second time . and if i am torn down again it \ 
will be by my hand , not the hands of others.in california i said i \ 
wouldn't hid my voice anymore , so get ready because i am ready to speak . \ 
I love me ! 
everyone loves a good bit of confusion ... 
Winged\ 
open your wings\ 
feel the wind , full force\ 
fly with your feet on the ground\ 
looking down , while moving up\ 
feel your feathers\ 
show them proud\ 
power in beauty\ 
beauty in self\ 
beat you wings\ 
cause the wind of change\ 
control the chaos\ 
the chaos within\ 
show yourself full force\ 
open our wings

There is a program called AntiVira Pro , stay the hell away from it , it somehow got on my comp and screwed up my internet AND prevented me from opening all programs . They are based in london , their program acts more like a virus than an antivirus program . lol .
