I had a riding lesson yesterday ... long story short , I fell off Storm and my elbow hit my rib , my head hit and I blacked out . Mom took me to the Chiropractor to adjust my back but he took x-rays and said it looked as though I cracked a rib , so he couldn '

WHAT A NIGHT ! At about 1AM today , the smoke alarm went off because SOMEONE wanted popcorn and OVERCOOKED IT !!! So everyone in this dorm had to get up and go outside in the COLD , until the Fire Department got here . What a GREAT fire drill ! The only thing I grabbed in my annoyed sleepy state was my keys , phone , and the blanket I had on ( the one Aunt < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > gave me ) . Oh and how are you this morning ? 
I'm home for the week ! HOpefuly it stays nice so I can beat < PROPMALE > at Tennis again ! He's really good at it . Better than I am , which makes it great when I win . It's a fun sport .

Today is \Give Your Mom a Flower Day \"" 
Heading back to work soon 
I AM ENJOYING MY DAY OFF !!! MUHAHAHAHAHAHAHA 
Sometimes when people say you are wise it really means they hear God speaking rather than you . We are not at all wise and true wisdom belongs to God alone . 
I don't know if I should be happy the summer is over and school starting or sad that it went so fast and time became my enemy . I will miss my Hope group , you were the best . Taught me a lot . 
Why is saying good-bye so hard ? I will totally miss my hyper girl and the little boy who tackled me whenever he had the < PROPMALE > . I cried while taking him home and he looked at me with understanding big brown eyes . * sniff * 
On my lunch break until 4 . I am only a little more than 5 hours away from the end of my job at G&W ! 
The trouble about trying to make yourself stupider than you really are is that you very often succeed . \ 
- C . S . < PROPFIRST > 
So I got here yesterday , had fun unpacking with < PROPFEMALE > , enjoyed my first day without anyone I know today . < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > out with me and I almost worked her to death ;) jk . We did a LOT of exercising ! 
GOD IS GOOD ! I got a refund check and it was enough to buy the books I needed to get . All I have left book wise is picking the ones up from home when they get there . 
I'm nervous about my classes . I wonder what they will be like and the personalities of my prof . s should be fun to figure out . 
I am applying for jobs . I am hoping something comes through soon ... pray that it does ! 
So I have applied at so many places and no reply has come . I am praying something does and thanking God for the job He is giving me , but sometimes it is hard to wait . Wil you please pray that a job comes through for me ? THANKS ! 
I HAVE A JOB ! So it's only 8 hours a week , it's still a job . I'm going to continue to look for another job but thank God for the job anyway ! THANK YOU , JESUS ! 
I LOVE this school ! They normally have pizza but Chicken < PROPMALE > ? My favorite ! 
I am doing homework ... and * whispers*(studying )* 
Thanks to my family growing up on Macintosh Computers , I got a job in a computer/music lab with these computers and get paid to study and do homework while monitoring the lab . :D I love my job ! Thank you Jesus . I also got four more work hours added to my schedule ! 
I don't think I am ready for classes yet 
I hate APA writing style ! 
Dear Fear of Heights , I am done with you . You cannot hold me back . I am leaving you for good this time . You may stand waiting to take me back but your wait will be forever . I have a new love , His name is Jesus and He won't put up with you anymore . We are through . I have begun my new life without you through vaulting and tumbling , what a joy it will be to defeat your attempts to pull me back . Good bye forever . \

I am thinking of planning a get together at my dorm .... card night anyone ? 
Watching Facing the Giants 
Is praying that all of SEK is kept safe and little damage is done there . Plus that it is way out of my area so I can do tumbling tomorrow 
Is thinking a lot of what I learn in class explains things that I witnessed happen 
So I went to Pizza Hut here and asked for a job . God had led me to the right one and I got the job right then and there . God is so good ! I start tomorrow . So I can't go to the Ren . Festival but I have another job to help pay bills . AND I get to continue TUMBLING !!!! 
I hate studying ! It is time consuming ! 
Got a lot to do today . I am interviewing a Social Worker at 11 , working in the lab from 1-5 , then at 5:30 - 9:30 working at Pizza Hut 
What to do ? What to do ? I am at a split and I don't know what to do . Any advice ? Here is the scenario : on Oct . 2 PSU and their rivals MSSU play football . My tumbling instructor is from MSSU and is a yell-leader . I am only going to the game because he asked me to . Who do I cheer for ? PSU or MSSU ? What do you think ? 
I will sit on MSSU's side at the game . Hopefully my instructor will spot me . I am only going because he asked me to . 
I think God asks stuff of us to see if we really rely on Him . He never asks of us things we cannot do , but things He knows we can do but we only think we cannot . 
See ya peoples at the game . If I see ya from MSSU side , i'll wave ;) 
Even though MSSU lost 24-21 to PSU , they still played good and I am not ashamed to have cheered for them . 
Life could get worse and in my case I am praying it doesn't . Here's why , I have 5-7 papers to write , three interviews , and to top it off , my 3-4 year old laptop , is pretty much dead . It'll start up but do nothing else . I'm also hoping I can get ahold of my anxiety level so I hold everything together . Sigh , don't you just LOVE life ? 
\Never Alone\ " by Barlow Girl " 
I find having to write done on notecards , what I want in my paper from the articles I have , is a waste of time . I could just as easily place it in a word document and go from there but we have to use notecards and turn those in too . Sigh , I find it annoying . Thus Facebook rather than writing the paper 
so I ran this morning ... ok it was more like walking but I still enjoyed my time with God 
I am getting farther on the papers due next week , but I really want to quit ... Facebook stop being so easy to go to ... I need to go back to working on the papers ....

My life is cold , and dark , and dreary ; it rains , and the wind is never weary ; my thoughts still cling to the moldering past , but the hopes of youth fall thick in the blast , and the days 
I dislike having to write papers ... yes I prefer them over tests I can't use notes in , but still . The ethical dilemma is an interesting one to pull together ...

TIME TO PARTY !!!! I got another paper done ! So it's being reviewed first , but still ! One more done on the LOONNGG list of papers coming up 
< PROPFEMALE > sends me a pic message sayin I got mail at home & it's about ciggarettes . In the message she says , \lol . Quit smoking ! \ " \ 
I thank God that I am a faithful student who only has three classes meeting and I CHOOSE NOT TO SKIP my 6:00 pm class when the other two ended at 12:30 pm !!!! Now I \get\ " to drive in the dark . So much for picking up geocaches on my way home . Bummer " 
So what do I do ? I have no homework left to do ... My presentation for tomorrow is great as is and I don't want to change its greatness ... what do I do ? Facebook isn't very interesting ...

I am glad God monitors us to know if He needs to remind us of the strength we have in Him and that we know how to use it because He's trained us to use it . 
well ... the count down to the end of the semester is officially started ! 9 Days ! 
Well it wasn't burnt macaroni and tin foil or 1am ( CCC students from last semester will know what I mean ) , but it's still cold when you have to go outside because the fire alarm went off . BUT it was a false alarm ! Someone burnt popcorn . * rolls eyes * 
8 days until the last day of school . However I will not be leaving until Friday morning . 
I have my Christmas Shopping out of the way . Except < PROPFEMALE>'s gift .... what to get her ... any ideas all ? 
7 days till the end of the semester 
I learned a VALUABLE lesson from God tonight . I had asked Him for power and strength for tumbling tonight . He taught me that we should not just ask for power unless we know how to use it . Yes , I have had His power surge through my muscles and it was a feeling that I < PROPFEMALE > , just to have His strength run through my body , and a limited dose of strength at that too , but that was not the lesson for tonight .... 
6 days until the end of this semester ! 
< PROPFEMALE > and I went to see the new Narnia last night in Joplin at a 9:45 pm showing . It was great and the best part about not working until 5pm today , I'm going to catch up on that sleep we didn't get because of the late night 
FIVE DAYS ! 
4 days left ! Today is my last at Pizza Hut until next semester , and I have Wednesday for my last day in the Computer lab until next semester 
my dead iPod is thinking about living again !!!!!! It wants me to charge it again ... maybe it'll decide living is a great idea ! 
Question for everyone : If you could only ask for one thing from God when you got to heaven , what would it be ? 
3 days left . One more final done , three more tests to go 
Only two days left before I can head home ! 
I leave tomorrow at 9ish and will take < PROPFEMALE > home , then be home for dinner 
I am HOME ! 
I am thankful to be able to come home for Christmas break and relax 
Live life for God and fulfil the mission He has set up for you .
