I quite my job tonight . I have become so tired of this rat race I am in . All I want is to raisew my children . Yet , I do understand that I need a job to take care of the financial side . Confusion is my companion tonight people . 
Today is a new day and I am happy . It has been a long time coming . 
I have been blessed in more ways than one . \Look at the blessings you do have because it is more than you could ever know . \"" 
No more avatars or cartoon pictures . lol 
I am so blessed !! 
Just filled out my Census information and placed it in the mailbox . Please fill out yours and mail it back in ASAP . BE COUNTED ! This will insure future government funding for all our communities . 
I have come to realize that I set an example for my people here in < PROPMALE > . Family is very important to me . When I come back home almost 4 years ago it was < PROPFEMALE > clear that I had become a < PROPFEMALE > . I had no choice in the matter because I am the eldest . What hurts the most is that my mother can longer stand to be < PROPFEMALE > . Needless to say , I Stand , I Rise and I am free to be me . A Black Native American < PROPFEMALE > . 
With change comes pain and with pain comes growth . We are all growing right now . LOL Damn it hurts ! 
Family means , \NOBODY GETS LEFT BEHIND OR FORGOTTEN\ " . Now how many has been left behind and or forgotten ? Look at the whole picture and not just what we want to see . " 
Hello everyone , been off line now for almost a month . Back up and running . I am answering all messages and emails . To all my sisters love you and please forgive , struggling on this end . SERIOUSLY !!! Congrats to < PROPFEMALE > on her Graduation !! 
Understanding is the key to unlock the door of wisdom . Thank you Jesus 
Being a blessed woman is more than have material things , it is having a deep connection to God and to nature . Having favor with God is not asking Him for something and He gives it , it is the uncontional love that you feel in your soul . Knowing that God is looking down on you and He has made the sunshine because He loves you . Understanding is the key and wisdom is the door . I have just walked through the threshold .... 
Now I understand why my sister was so pissed . There is a right and a wrong way to do anything in life . By choosing the wrong way you are creating something very evil . Freedom of speech is something our forefathers fought and died for . True somethings should not be said , however if they were not said we would not live in this country called < PROPFEMALE > and we would not have the Constitution . 
Looking at life through spiritual eyes gives wisdom , being humbled in the soul is a blessing that is given in do season . Understanding comes when you truly let go and let God . Compassion comes from deep within the human soul , it is authentic and genuine . BE GENUINE , BE AUTHENTIC , BE COMPASSIONATE , HAVE HUMILITY , SO YOU CAN BE BLESSED !!! 
Speak to my heart Lord , give me your holy word , if I just hear from you , then I know what to do . I won't go alone , I will never go on my own . ~ Donnie McClurkin I love this Gospel song . The words are up lifting and it truly lets you know that God is on the move . 
One of my bestfriends ( have 2 ) will be moving to Chicago tomorrow . I miss her already !! Love you < PROPFEMALE > !!!! 
OMG !!! I am ready to cut my hair . It is hard to keep up with sometimes . I look forward to the day when I can go to the salon ( like every week if need be , ya feel me) !!! LOL 
Back in my late teens-early twenties I was an exotic dancer . I lived a life of glamour , money , and pornography . I am not glorifing this life because it came with a price , a high one . I should have died in this world but it was God how showed me mercy because He saw the woman I would become . Now I am a devoted mother and a saved woman . Life molds you into the person you will become . Live life and learn !!! 
After reading my last status , your looking at me crazy , right ? Well , I look at it like this . I have lived my life , some parts were good and some bad . I have no regrets because regreting just mean you have learned nothing and < PROPFEMALE > Be To God , I have learned . When you learn lifes lessons you will be rewarded and the reward is a gold ring of wisdom . I got my ring , you got yours . 
Even though in the picture that you see of Smooshie , she is not me ... lol even though it states that I am tagged in it . There is another picture of me . Too all my friends on FB I am not pregnant ... lol 
I am watching a wonderful movie on Lifetime , it is starring < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > , She is a wonderful singing and an equally wonderful actress . Catch \Sins of the mother\ " Excellent movie . EXCELLENT !! " 
GOOD MORNING SUNSHINE !! 
I am so thankful that BP is giving up 20 billion dollars to the people and businesses in the Gulf . BP has stated that if more funds are needed they will give it . I am equally worried about the wildlife in the Gulf . Gases are seeping into the water and this will create a dead zone . What is BP going to do about the eco-system ? 
TO ALL MY FACEBOOK FRIENDS ... PLEASE IF YOU CAN , TAKE TIME TO READ MY NOTES . I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW YOUR FEEDBACK . PLEASE BE HONEST ABOUT YOUR THOUGHTS AS WELL AS YOUR FEELINGS . I AM IN THE PROCESS OF WRITING A BOOK AND WOULD REALLY LOVE TO HEAR WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT CERTAIN TOPICS . THANKS !! 
TO ALL MY FB FAMILY THAT STAND AND BE THE MAN TO AND FOR THEIR CHILDREN . THIS SHOT OUT ALSO GOES TO ALL THE WOMEN WITH BIGGER BALLS THAN THEIR BABY DADDY !! HAPPY FATHER'S DAY !!! 
I've been thinking about my father for the past week or so . Even though we've had our ups and downs , I forgive him however forgetting about it is the hard part and guess that will come in time . Bottom line he is still my father . Happy Father's Day < PROPMALE > Jones ~ AKA ~ Daddy . \WITH SO MUCH PAIN BRINGS HEALING BEYOND UNDERSTANDING \"" 
LIFE HAS A WAY OF SHOWING YOU WHATS WHAT AND WHO'S WHO ! IF YOU COULD SEE MY FACE RIGHT NOW , I AM SMILING FROM EAR TO EAR ... THANK YOU JESUS !!! 
What's considered a \Golddigger\ " ????? LOL " 
Let me rephrase the question , what classifies a woman as a golddigger ? I was told that it is a woman that dates a guy because he has money . Is this correct ? 
OMG .. My 6 years olds permenant teeth are coming in crooked , he WILL need braces . Mo money ! Mo money ! Mo money ! He gets that Sh**T from his father side of the family . 
My 2 year old decided to launch a plastic baseball bat through his bedroom window this morning , thank God no one was cut . The bat was stuck in the window like a missile .. mo money ! mo money ! mo money ! 
GOD IS MOVING MOUNTAINS FOR ME AND MY SON'S!!! ALL I CAN SAY OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS ... THANK YOU JESUS 
MF are pissed at me because I decided to speak my mind . F**k all that talk their sh*t behind my back but don't have the balls to do it to my face . To ALL my sisters on FB love you and stand strong . To < PROPFEMALE > B ( < PROPFEMALE > ) congrads on your move . This shows your maturity and tell those cornball haters to kick rocks with no shoes . It's time for me to start healing ( my mind ) . 
Read and understand what our ancestors struggled and died for . Understand and remember how our great nation was founded . Once you have understood ALL that is written , then with your spiritual eyes you will see were we ( you ) are going . 
I MISS YOU < PROPFIRST > J < PROPMALE > !!!! \YOU ROCK MY WORLD\ " AND MY LIFE !!! Check out the website on my < PROPFEMALE >!" 
At the age of 33 I am finally taking the steps to heal my mind and my heart . It is amazing because I am seeing who is my friend and who is truly my family . WOW ! I LOVE Therapy !!! 
HAPPY 4TH OF JULY !!!! ALL MY FB FAMILY AND FRIENDS , YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE ! AND TOO EVERYONE ELSE GOD BLESS , PEACE ! 
My feet are itching again . It is time to move , WHERE ? I have a dream of moving me and my little family to Montana . My Native American blood is calling me home . I no longer want to fit in or belong . You know what FB fam , I wish I was a full blood ( Native American ) and not a half-breed . Damn I like Therapy !!! 
I filled out Section 8 papers for Kalispell , Montana yesterday . My heart is so excited because this town is in the heart of the Blackfeet reservation . My Grandmother is from here . I'm aching now because I have to wait for the paper work to go through . I AM READY TO GET THE FUCK OUT THIS NASTY , IGNORANT , SUPERFICIAL AND MATTRESS BACK ASS CITY . I'm not trying to be mean or anything , I just hate it here . 
Oki-Ni-Kso-Ko-Wa 
EVERTIME I turn around I am being blessed . I am learning a new way of living and a new way of thinking . Wow , all I am need now is for my money to flow like water ( coming ) and my section 8 in Montana to go through ( coming too ) . < PROPFEMALE > , things are getting better !!!! 
How small this world is , wow ! God is Good ! 
Today was a day of reflection . I like days like this , it always opens my mind to new possibilities and helps me to look past the horizon . 
I awoke this morning at 4am , so I got up and made me a pot of coffee , picked up my bible and prayed . I saw the sun rise ! 
Here I go again FB fam dropping bombs on yo head ! Stirring emotions in your souls and even changing hearts along the way . \Comprehension is the key to unlock the door of wisdom . \ " ( Fortune Cookie ) " 
I am exhausted , I've been up sense 4am and I had therapy today . It is amazing how the mind can hold so much yet produce so little . I've been holding on to a lot of pain and today I released some of it . WWOOWW I feel so light .. AMAZING 
My mind is still clicking from therapy yesterday , its difficult to write when I'm this way . All I want to do is release these words . I'm destine to make millions if I do ! Being this way is like trying to squeeze water from a dry spondge . 
Slowly the waters of my thoughts are being absorbed my the spondge of my mind . Thanks < PROPFIRST > for those thought provoking reads , NEEDED that ! 
He is hot as hell here and my 3 year old is crying for some paper , my 6 year old is eating all the food in the house . Their only 3 and 6 , what in the hell am I going to do when they get 13 and 16 ? !! SHAKING MY HEAD RIGHT NOW !! 
Thought it was going to rain , no such luck 
Good Morning FB fam , its another hot one in the 216 . Those storms last night was welcomed . I slept like a baby . 
WE CAN SIT ALL DAY LONG AND TELL A WOMAN THAT LOVES A MAN ( WHETHER HE IS GOOD OR BAD ) TO LEAVE HIM . IT IS NOT FOR US TO TELL HER WHAT TO DO BECAUSE IN THE END SHE IS GOING TO DO WHAT SHE WANTS . AS WOMEN WE MUST GIVE UNDERSTANDING BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE BEEN IN HER SHOES . THE QUESTION IS , \DID YOU LEARN ANYTHING WHEN YOU WAS THERE OR ARE YOU STILL DUM AS FUCK ? \ " \ 
I thank God everyday ! I am a survivor and it is because of God I am here . I sit back and read some of the statuses on FB and I wonder what have they learned in their lives ? Or better yet , are they learning anything in their lives ? It is mind boggling , how many are stuck on stupid , looking for dum and searching for crazy . 
PLEASE READ CAREFULLY WHAT I WRITE !! To my cuz < PROPMALE > , nigga YOU need to get it together . I am not angry nor am I hurt . Just a little curious !!! Ruffling feathers I see . I have a right to speak and write what I feel . Everyone else does ! So please don't get upset because I feel if your upset then it is you that I am talking about . 
Good Sunday Morning FB fam . I just re-read all of my statuses from yesterday and I must confess , I am a controvercial person . I have always thought outside the box and I have always ruffled feathers . The only difference between now and then . Then , I would hide after I spoke my piece , afraid . Now , when I speak I stand strong behind what I believe , I am no longer afraid . 
Today was an eye opening , soul shaking day . There is peace inside , < PROPFEMALE > BE TO GOD there is peace inside . So on that note , lets KEEP MOVING FORWARD !!! 
It is time for me to purging my friends list again . I need genuine people in my world . Fake MF produce to many head games for me . I am already healing from a lifetime of head games from my own kin . I can't change my kin but I can change my friends . IF YOU ARE DELETED , YOU WILL BE BLOCKED ! 
IT IS DONE !!!! I have successfully deleted all the head gamers . If I missed anyone , I garontee I WILL weed you out . All that is left are family and friends that give me peace of mind and know that I love you . 
It is amazing how much you miss out on when you have a bunch of trash in the way . I'm glad I took out the trash this morning ! 
My 3 year old is always up with the sun rise ! 
Today is another day of exploration of my mind . What an adventure !!! 
The day is coming to a close and I must say , the devil was busy today but Jesus had other plans and the devil was defeated !! THANK GOD FOR JESUS !!! 
I don't feel good today , I really need a hug and a bottle of Merlot with good conversation . Maybe not the Merlot .. lol but the hug and conversation show do sound nice right about now !!! 
I feel alot better today . 
My cousin < PROPFEMALE > has passed her OGT exams . We was worried when she failed them this past april but she retook them and passed with flying colors . KEEP MOVING FORWARD < PROPFEMALE > !!! I am so proud of you and I love you so much . Check out her beautiful prom pictures on my < PROPFEMALE > . She has grown into a smart and resourceful young woman !!!! 
Bright as the morning sun I rise ! \

Freedom , freedom , freedom ! 
Other day here in < PROPMALE > . I look forward to moving to the Big Sky state . I'm in a fight right now and I have the victory ! My name is Girlisha , not < PROPFEMALE > . 
This picture is in Montana . < PROPFEMALE > be to God , I can wake up to this sene every morning and watch the sun set between these mountains every evening . Watching my son's grow up in and with nature . Free !! 
This is Fort Peck Lake in Montana . 
God is good and He makes ways out of no ways for the ones that trust Him . TRUST HIM MY FB FAM !! \ 
Love Ya :-) 
Telling the TRUTH shames the devil . It is time for the TRUTH to be told . Everything that glitter is not gold . 
I am very thankful with the way my life is going . I have bloomed in adversity and I have discovered that I'm a beautiful flower . < PROPFEMALE > be to God , it can only get better :) 
Thank You everyone for the Birthday wishes . I have been off-line for over a month . I was in an accident . I am ok but my left hip and my lower back will never be the same . I love and miss all of you . :) 
A woman of TRUE beauty can take a picture and it does her no justice ... ~ GDH Fortune Cookie ~
