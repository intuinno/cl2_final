I dyed my hair (: 
Me and < PROPFIRST>'s 5month is tomorrow ! :D 
I just found out what \My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard\ " actually means . LOL " 
I hate people that kill animals and bugs for no reason . People kill bugs because they're ugly , what if we killed people because they were ugly too ? Double Standard . 
Why are people putting their fingers on their face when they take their pictures ? It seems like everyone does it , it's so annoying , and it's not pretty either , neither is scrunching up your face while you're doing it . 
Isn't it funny how people say they love eachother after only a few days of dating ? LOL
