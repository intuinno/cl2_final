I love the army ! Nothing like making it through the work day only to find out you need to do the overnight duty ! Yay ! 

I am tempted to start throwing very large spears at people . 
Ok I can disarm now . 
Insomnia sucks ! I hope I am not tempted to break out the giant spears again tomorrow . 
Seems like I will have a case of the Mondays . 
It's military tradition that true friends can go long periods of time \ 
without speaking and never question their friendship . These friends pick\ 
up just like they spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been \ 
or how far apart they live . REPOST this if you are lucky enough to have \ 
at ... least one friend like this . 
Capitalization is important . - \Help your Uncle < PROPFIRST > off the horse\ " as opposed to \ " Help your uncle < PROPFIRST > off the horse . \ " I took this from < PROPMALE > Cavalli's board . " 
Aloha , audios , auf wiedersehen , and goodbye Barstow !!!!! I really will miss you for the next two weeks , really , you might have to note the sarcasm in my voice !!! 
Goodbye Barstow !!! 
Hello Arizona , goodbye California . 
Oh my it's New Mexico . 
Now crossing from New Mexico to Colorado ! 
Approaching Kansas city 
And now Iowa . 
Now in Illinois . 
Wisconsin is everything I thought it would be ! 
Alright my mind is changed Wisconsin is a nice state . 
Bye bye Chicago . 
Barstow sucks again . 
< PROPFIRST > Gibbons : So I was sitting in my cubicle today , and I realized , ever since I started working , every single day of my life has been worse than the day before it . So that means that every single day that you see me , that's on the worst day of my life . \ 
Dr. Swanson : What about today ? Is today the worst day of your life ? \ 
\ 
< PROPFIRST > Gibbons : Yeah . \ 
Dr. Swanson : Wow , that's messed up . 
With the first game of the preseason starting today the Lakers start their march to a threepeat ! 
This is one mighty hail storm ! Why has it been raining here in the desert so much this week ? 
Every person has 1000 wishes .... A cancer patient only has one : to get better . I know that 97% will not repost this as their status but I know my friends will be the 3% ! Even for an hour in honor of those we lost to cancer and those still fighting it ! 
ACAP ! 
This weekend for me has been the very definition of boredom . 
Well tomorrow is my favorite holiday of the year . But this thanksgiving is just looking like its going to be one crappy \silent and gray\ " day . " 
Paralysis .... \ 
Unspoken words ,.... \ 
Unfullfilled dreams .... \ 
R < PROPFEMALE > ning trough my mind ,... \ 
Paralyze me ...... \ 
.. \ 
Uns < PROPFEMALE > g songs ,.... \ 
Unwritten lyrics .... \ 
Fill my heart ,.... \ 
Revive me .... \ 
Well for some reason I felt like sharing this poem from an < PROPFEMALE > discovered < PROPMALE > talent . I personally loved it and for some reason was thinking about it . Hopefully they will let me give them credit for it . 
How is it that my former wife can find a day and time when I want as little contact possible with anyone , least of all her and give me a call . I was just falling asleep which I dont do easily . Now I am just going to be awake and bothered for like the next million billion hours . 
People respond way better to < PROPFEMALE > than vinegar ! 
Amazing , I left my favorite coffee mug in north Hollywood and 6 months later it's still in the same establishment ! 
Copy this text and put it in your status if you know someone or have heard of someone who knows someone .

FOR GOD'S SAKE DON'T FORGET THE HEARTS ! ? ? ? ? ? ? 
Home sweet Barstow , the crown < PROPFIRST > of civilization ! A 12 hour stop here is just not long enough . 
Few things in life measure up to being stuck in a southern California snow storm on the freeway just outside of San Bernardino . After an hour I moved nearly half a mile . 
If you eliminate the impossible what ever remains no matter how improbable must be the truth . Just food for thought to some harsh a holes . 
In a weekend where I learned 3 people were not who I thought they were I am honored that a lady from skokie is not one of them . 
Yeah I think the West Coast and I are done . I am leaning towards getting very far away from this state . Maybe New York or something . Just not here . I do not have much reason for staying anymore . So as soon as I am done with the military I will say good bye . 
There is an informant on here about me . STOP . 
Next time I go for a trip anywhere I will not forget my ST . < PROPMALE > necklace . It is the first time in a while I did and it was a disaster .
