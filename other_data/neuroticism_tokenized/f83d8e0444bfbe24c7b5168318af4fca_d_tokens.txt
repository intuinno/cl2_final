The things I want to do to you would make Satan blush ! ; ) ... or proud . 
is looking for something to do , and someone to do it with ... or , to . =^) 
Best buzz in the world , coupled with the worst hangover in existance . Champagne . 
Halloween's coming ... so many choices , so little time . 
Halloween : I know where I'm going , and I know what I am wearing . Now , do I take someone with , or just take someone home ? >=^) 
True euphoria can be found in all actions , no matter how base or animalistic . SO I ask of all that read this : When was the last time you had truly mind-blowing , spine-tingling , toe-curling , touched by the gods ... \

And it was written : All things that come to an end , must have a beginning . This is the beginning of tomorrow , and the end of yesterday . It is a point of infinite change . 
Well , it's a marvelous night for a Moondance ... 
is fed up with empty words and hollow people . 
just saw a good old man , whom he's known for years , slip away into the afterlife . Seeing his wife and son was by far the hardest part , though . 
In the darkest pits of hell , the Devil hatched an evil plan ... to tempt the fiddle player , for he's just a mortal man . 
I am tired of being just a friend . Women can't get passed the hang-up of my size . Well , it ain't goin ' away . But , alas , I guess as long as I have the weight , I am damned by it . 
2010 was my year of Change , and what changes ! Now , I HAVE DECIDED on my theme for 2011 ! \

I am feeling better than I have in a long time . 
I just realized that the Tooth < PROPFEMALE > teaches little kids to sell their body parts for a little cash ... weird . 
Tired of being walked on by family . 
I'm having a FAR better evening than I did morning . Still a little ticked , but it'll get better .

@ Perkins w/ Tank , sitting in the booth next to a manager ... for IHOP . =^) 
Life is too short to allow oneself to slip into mediocrity . 
A-CHOO !!!........? (-???•?) ?....... If you're allergic to bullshit , drama queens , head games , liars , and 2 faced people , keep this sneeze going ... I can't wait to see who'll re-post this . 
I'm hittin ' the gym after work . Anyone else game ? 
Welcome to the Carnal Carnival ! Come for the games , stay for the lack of anywhere else to go .

I fear the night on which I will never see the stars , for they are the guide of all the universe , and without that guide , we are lost . 
Enlightenment is the balance between Ignorange , Intellect , and Insight . 
I had too good of a day , and am now fighting to keep from getting depressed as I wind down . 
So , who decided 0400hrs . was the proper time for all the junk e-mail to be sent to my Crackberry ? Pray I never find you , whoever you are . Grrr . 
I love the copious amounts of shi t-t alking going down on FB right now , because y'all won the Superbowl ... 
And as we wind on down the road / Our shadows taller than our soul / There walks a lady we all know 
Oh , why do I live this way ?

Namaste , y'all! 
The light of the World is within each one of us . Let it shine in your actions , and it will fill your being . 
No amount of < PROPFEMALE > words and/or positive thought are doing the trick . It's official , I'm depressed . Don't ask why , cause I dunno . 
One day of deep depression , and one more day of raving like a psycho serial killer , and other than a mild headache , I seem to be back to my carefree old self . I haven't wanted to kill anyone yet today , which is a good sign ! 
< PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > once defeated < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > . Where's < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > now ? 
< PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > doesn't play \hide-and-seek\ " . He plays \ " hide-and-pray-to-God-I-don't-find-you\ " . " 
And God said \Let there be light . \ " And < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > said \ " Say ' Please ' . \"" 
Still a little anti-social , but the < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > jokes are helping my overall demeanor . 
I give up , and wash my hands of the whole affair ... 
Today we lost < PROPFIRST > Buckles , our last living World War I veteran . \ 
Thank you and everyone who fought by your side . Your generation is gone but not forgotten . 
I need a new drug . One that won't make me sick . 
A ife without laughter is like ... boring . 
A life without laughter is like ... boring . 
As I look into the night sky , hopes crumbling around me , I do not fall into my dark center . There is still a glimmer of < PROPMALE > , and I will ride that spark wherever it may lead . 
15 Days til Con ... 
The Girl you just called fat ? She has been starving herself & has lost over 30lbs . The Boy you just called stupid ? He has a learning disability & studies over 4hrs a night . The Girl you just called ugly ? She spends hours putting makeup on hoping people will like her . The Boy you just tripped ? He is abused enough at home . There's a lot more to people than you think . Put this as your status if you're against bullying 
Knowing someone for a long time does not give you the right to treat them like shit . You would think a grown ass man would know something like that ...

Today is the day we punish our liver , punish our liver , punish our liver . Today is the day we punish our liver , til early the next morning . 
This time next week , I will be neither at work nor stone cold sober . C'mon , Con ! 
I just realized that we sit and stare at a screen , we have imaginary farms and fake animals , we poke people and its okay , we even write on walls . Think about it .... Facebook is a mental hospital .... and we are all patients !!! \ 
Feel free to steal ... I did !

And I've got an interview this coming week for a much better job . Con has blessed me . 
Buudha and the War Machine departed from Con to acquire some chinese food . In costume . Many odd looks . 
Goodbye , Con 29

Already planning bigger n better for Con 30 ... 
Began my road into Rohai at midnight this morning . 1 day down , just 1825 to go . 
A true friend doesn't care when you're broke , what you weigh , if your house is a mess , what you drive , about your past , or if your family is filled with crazy people . Your conversations pick up where they left off , even if it has been months ( or years ) apart . They love you ... for who you are . Re-post if you have at least one true friend . They will know who they are
