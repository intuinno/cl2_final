thank you everyone . i appreciate it . 
. wtf is wrong with the place we call the land of the free when everything we do is controlled and dictated by someone else who is supposedly better than we are ? 
life is an adventure . live it the way you want to the most imortant thing is that you are happy and making those around you happy . never give up on yourself or the people you love . LIVE 
i miss living by myself . time wasnt an issue and it was so much more fun . cant wait till i get my dorm at schriever . 
life is too short to waste . live it to the best of your ability . never take it for granted . laugh often and never forsake friends and family . just live . 
most exciting part of the week : falling through my friends parents garage ceiling . 
life is a game of russian roulette . stepping outside is spinning the chamber . opening your mouth is pulling the trigger .
