constant pain that periodically makes you break into a cold sweat is not fun . at all . especially when it comes with a limp . 
Happy Birthday to my dad ! :) 
one of the next things on the list ... motorcycle helmet . and i guess a leather jacket to go with it . 
stepped in a puddle and got wet ... but then found i aced my math test . i believe that cancels out the wet sock . 
some people have never heard of deodorant ... thank god i'm still alive ! * gag * made < PROPFEMALE > and I laugh though , what with us burying our faces in our sweaters . 
doing chores at 6am with cows drenched with the first snowfall is not fun .. ah well , it had to come sometime . now i want to go ice skating . :) 
math class canceled ... bummer . 
passed that guy again on campus ... smoking something that smells somewhat like roasting marshmallows .. puts out a lot of smoke , long and skinny little thing ... weird . 
trying to search for a song on youtube ... it keeps saying there is a system error and something about how they've sent their team of highly trained monkeys to deal with it ...

in mentioning how Hitler applied to the school of < PROPMALE > in < PROPFEMALE > , my history professor said \it is really to bad that he was not accepted . for then Adolf Hitler would have become the < PROPMALE > ist he wanted to be and we never would have heard of him \""

if I get another cold shower tomorrow .... I'll .... be disappointed .. and cold .

cheesecakes ... again ?! whatever . * goes off to dig up some more recipes ... * 
decisive < PROPFIRST > ! be decisive ! otherwise we'll have too many cheesecakes ... 
while digging in the fridge for stuff to mix up I discovered I was talking to myself with an English accent ... gave < PROPFEMALE > and I a laugh .

\if you know you're screwed up you don't have to worry about being sane\ " -my sociology professor . :) " 
while reading her Chem text book is trying her hardest to convince herself that this is not leisure reading .. but her efforts are in vain .. 
< PROPFEMALE > Holm : \I wonder what you'd act like if you were drunk .. \ " Me : \ " What ?! Gosh .. thanks < PROPFEMALE >..\" . < PROPFEMALE > : \ " It'd be funny . You'd probably giggle a lot . \"" 
Has decided she should get herself a hippie-ish sweater .. yup .
