Chilling and relaxing . . . a nap sounds great ! 

I think I may have been tired cause I so just slept 13 hrs straight !!!!! 
I love me some softball , perhaps except when it entails playing in 95 degree direct sun . . . It's a hot one ! So hitting up the pool after !

Sundays Suck ! They are the devil's day ! Hate going back to work the next day , add in an L2 , and it is a recipe for crabbiness ! Maybe brownies should be added to the recipe to help ? :) 
I wish working out wasn't such work ! Why can't it be called happy fun time where pounds magically disappear ! OOOh , a perfect world !!!! 
Note to self . . . playing 9 holes of gold , playing 2 softball games , and then attempting to swim all in one day is NOT a good idea !!!

Wedding cake tastes yummy . . . details are coming together nicely ! 
Back in KS , but still missing the mountains :(

After 4 hrs of cleaning , the house is finally clean . . . I think I might be able to stop twitching now ! 
After taking a month off , I finally found my way back to the gym ... the pain feels so good :( or so I keep telling myself . 
Is it the weekend yet , cause I think I could use a stiff < PROPFEMALE > . . . or better yet several !!!!!! 
Does anyone , anyone want to go dancing with me ? I need to blow off some steam and I'm not picky . I'll take a hobo at this point :( . . . Man , I miss my < PROPMALE > crew and the Packing house so bad !!!!!

Bored . . . 
Is it childish to want a game night ? Board games , cards , anything fun ! 
So , I told < PROPMALE > he was a catch . His response was : Oh yeah , like one of those catches where your drudging the bottom of the ocean with a net , then I get all caught up in the netting and you wanna throw me back , but SHIT , I'm already dead , so what's the point in throwing me back now . Such a smartass , but I love him .

No wonder our cats have weight issues , Nibbles must have cholesterol problems too because he can't seem to get enough butter or french fries that he keeps stealing .. . 
You can imagine my delight at knowing we have gotten 5-6 inches of snow and my car is perfectly cleaned off before I touch it . I back out fine and then realized where all the snow went . . . about 10 ft away in the huge ass drift I was then stuck in . . . GRRR to Kansas wind ! 
* * * Let it snow , let it snow , let it snow * * * 
? It's been said that everlasting friends go long periods of time without speaking and never question the friendship . These friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been or how far away they live , and they don't hold grudges . They understand that life is busy and you will ALWAYS love them . Re-post if you have at least 1 of these friends , they will know who they are ... 
All of this beautiful warm weather has given me spring fever , which means only one thing . . . it's time for a spring shopping spree ! Booyay ! 
Far to early to be awake . . . MORE coffee plz 
Got over 13 hrs of sleep today . . . If sleeping was a profession , I would be a CEO by now !
