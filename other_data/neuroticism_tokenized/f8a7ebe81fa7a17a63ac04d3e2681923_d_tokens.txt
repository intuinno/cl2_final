put this as your status if you know or are related to someone killed on Alderaan when it was obliterated by the Death < PROPFEMALE > . My wish is that people will understand the Empire is a band of murdering scum . The Rebel Alliance wants only to bring peace to the galaxy , but the Empire ... continues to kill innocent civilians . ... 93% of people won't copy/paste this . YOU make this your status for at least an hour . 
:) 
Gets to go home tomorrow :D 
Chickity < PROPFEMALE > , the Chinese chicken , you have a drum stick and your brain starts tickin ' . 
Happy Thanksgiving :) 
Change your default facebook picture to a cartoon from your childhood . The goal ? To not see a human face on facebook until Monday the 6th of Dec . Join the fight against child abuse , and invite your friends to do the same ! 
Sitting watching Classic Disney movies\

Watching Classic Disney movies\ 
----> Now Watching Sleeping Beauty 
I finally got around to reading Fight Club . I'm going to have to say it's one of the better books I've read in a long while . 
I could probably do a lot more with my life if I actually tried . 
Just got back from work and I smell like ranch :D 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas !! 
Very glad we have a white Christmas !!

< PROPFEMALE > nuary has a lot of birthdays : > \ 
< PROPFEMALE > 
Probably one of the worst weeks . Ever . 
Yesterday , I asked a few people if they knew any good restaurants to go for my birthday . Everyone suggested < PROPFEMALE > . xD 
I wish people wouldn't take satire so seriously ! 
Today I agreed to work for someone so they could take their kid to the doctors . I was scheduled to go in at 9:30 AM , and work until 5PM . Around 1 , the person supposed to be my relief calls in . So I ended up opening and closing . \ 
xD\ 
Today was supposed to be my day off . 
I put my two weeks notice in today . :( 
Going to go job hunting tomorrow wish me luck :) 
Totally thinks that < PROPFIRST > should let < PROPFEMALE > Mcghee , and < PROPFEMALE > Powell , work salads with me sometimes :D 
< PROPFIRST > leaves Monday :( 
So , the world's a pretty big mess right now . People are protesting against breastfeeding children , the death rate greatly surpasses the birthrate , Libyans are destroying each other , and the price of crude oil keeps rising everyday . \ 
Anyone else looking forward to the zombie apocalypse ? 
IT'S TIME TO SHOW THE WORLD THAT MORE OF US SUPPORT OUR TROOPS THAN DON'T!!! IF YOU SUPPORT OUR TROOPS THEN PLEASE POST THIS ON YOUR STATUS AND LEAVE IT THERE FOR ONE HOUR !! AND IF YOU DON'T STAND BEHIND OUR TROOPS , THEN PLEASE FEEL FREE TO STAND IN FRONT OF THEM !!!!! HOOAH !!! 
PLEASE-put this on your status if you know someone ( or are related to someone ) who has been eaten by dragons . Dragons are nearly unstoppable and , in case you didn't know , they can also breathe fire . 93% of people won't copy and paste this , because they have already been eaten by dragons . 6% of people are sitting in their shower armed with fire extinguishers and the remaining 1% are awesome and will re-post . 
So I've decided in the case that human carcasses litter the earth after Armageddon , I will not have to turn to cannibalism . Decomposing bodies make for great fertilizer !

And The wind cried < PROPFIRST > . 
Dear food , \ 
We've got to work on our love/hate relationship . 
I love you Gwendolynn < PROPFEMALE > , even if you do puke on all my shirts :) 
Today is such a beautiful day I might go for a walk :D 
Going for a walk :D 
Just got back from a wonderful walk with Gwendolynn . \ 
We explored all of Corbin today :D 
I heard Gwendolynn's laugh for the first time today :D 
Applying for scholarships\ 
any suggestions ? 
Gwendolynn just finished off her first bowl of rice cereal ! 
I don't want to go to work today :| \ 
Blegh 
Always remember to smile . Smiling releases endorphins , which causes your brain to think you're happy . Thus casing you to become happy . 
Today suuuuucked . :) 
I got accepted into Somerset community college for the spring of 2011 . :) 
Got called into work after a few hours of sleep\ 
Oh joy ~ ! 
TODAY SUUUUCKED < PROPMALE > HARDCORE . 
Today < PROPFEMALE > Reynolds , and I went to Fashion Palace and bought Gwendolynn so cute dresses !! 
Remember ; you are lucky to be alive . \ 
How many people are wishing they could be you right now ? 
I want to learn how to chiptune ; ___ ; 
It's supposed to rain in Japan , which is only going to further complicate things . \ 
:( 
I am a complete idiot . My phone just took a ride in the washing machine . - ___- ; 
Supermoon March 19th . 
Dx\ 
My shoulder is making an icky crunching noise when I rotate it ! \ 
e ___e I hate that sound . 
Let that city take you in\ 
let that city spit you out\ 
let that city take you down\ 
for god sakes turn around . 
I think I smile too much . \ 
Which sucks because my smile's not even an awesome smile\ 
it's a lame \herp derp\ " smile . " 
Some say a comet will fall from the sky , \ 
Followed by meteor showers and tidal waves\ 
Followed by fault-lines that cannot set still\ 
Followed by millions of dumbfounded dipshits . 
Playing peek-a-boo has never been so fulfilling . \ 
My day just got a million times better because I came home to a giggly Gwendolynn <3 . 
Dear < PROPFEMALE>'s employees , \ 
I don't think I'm ever going to drink coffee again while at work . 
My only day off this week is supposed to be < PROPFEMALE > and beautiful . I shall spend the entire day outside if possible <3 
I sat outside on the porch swing with Gwendolynn today , and remembered how taking a nap in the grass on a < PROPFEMALE > day was an awesome thing to do . Too bad our yard is covered in dog poo :P 
I just discovered I would fail so hard at being a rap artist . \ 
But that's okay . 
< Insert witty , and/or , philosophical view point on life that would entertain you . > 
:D I just bought some frillys for Gwendolynn <3 GAH she's so adorable ! 
Why is it that even though I had the day off that I still ended up going to < PROPFEMALE > to eat ? 
Did you ever wonder why we had to run for shelter with the promise of a brave new world unfurled beneath a clear blue sky ? 
Your love is better than wine\ 
but wine is all I have\ 
will your love ever be mine ? 
I've never quite understood why the goblins commented that the phrase didn't begin with \I wish . \ " when in fact it did ;\ 
: ( Two days of watching depressing movies may not have been the best choice . 
A couple drinks , a couple aspirin , repeat . \ 
This is the kind of day where the sun comes up only to humiliate you . 
We can masquerade about being who we are not only until we find our faces . \ 
And once we've found them , the choice is whether or not we wish to wear them . 
I want to play Dance dance revolution like < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > Wimsatt , and I used to :( 
Is debating on whether to watch Boys don't cry , or to begin on my 5 must-watch movies list . . . 
Sometimes I < PROPFEMALE > t to write , but my words make no sense . \ 
Sometimes I < PROPFEMALE > t to draw , but my lines don't form right . \ 
Sometimes I < PROPFEMALE > to sing , but my voice can't < PROPFEMALE > the tune . 
After working a 12 hour shift today I realized that for nearly 8 of those hours , I was off the clock :) 
I always find myself quite disappointed with how my favourite musicians sound live . 
Never allow the world to < PROPFEMALE > you\ 
make you cold and bitter\ 
Never allow the media to tell you that you are ugly\ 
or unacceptable\ 
Always remember that growing older is inevitable\ 
and growing up is an entirely different concept . \ 
\ 
And while you must grow up a little\ 
never forget how to have fun . \ 
Because they will try their best to break you . 
URGENT PRAYER REQUEST !!! < PROPFEMALE > SCOTT'S 22 MONTH OLD SON SHOT HIMSELF IN THE CHEST WITH A < PROPMALE > NAILER IT WENT IN HIS HEART HE iS NOW IN CRITICAL CONDITION AND NOT DOING WELL NEITHER IS HIS MOM PLEASE START A PRAYER CHAIN FOR THIS BABY PLEASE COPY & REPOST AS YOU WOULD WANT SOMEONE TO DO IT FOR YOU 
Today was good , today was fun , tomorrow is another one . \ 
From there to here , from here to there , \ 
Funny things are everywhere . 
Why do fools fall in love ? 
The pieces are falling into place , they only lack the power to put themselves together . Unfortunately , this is where we come in ; blind to their true intentions . 
To think that I just had one of the most serious discussions since graduating from high school , and it all started over asterisks at the end of typographical errors . 
Dear musicians , \ 
Sorry about ruining your songs with my shrill voice . \ 
:D \ 
I still love you . 
To never see the sun , is to never know that what your missing isn't as wonderful as it was cut out to be . 
\So much time and so little to do ! \ 
I do believe that I have caught a cold or something , my throat feels terrible :( \ 
BLEGGGGGGGGGGGH it would figure that on my days of I get sick . 
I'm super excited , my best friend in the entire universe < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is coming to visit me :DDDDDDDDD We are gonna have super fun times ! 
http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/06/this-is-why-ill-never-be-adult.html 
Had a pretty good day ! Gwendolynn and I miss < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ! 
I don't want to go to work today , it's too beautiful outside , and I want to lay in the sun with the smell of the fresh cut lawn . 
You'd laugh . 
I give myself /very/ good advice\ 
But seldom ever follow it . 
When you reach the pinnacle , \ 
Lavish in the spotlight momentarily , \ 
And when it starts to fade , \ 
Don't cling to what is not there , \ 
Don't try to upstage yourself , \ 
And just enjoy the ride down . 
His Punchlines Are Killer Just sayin ' . 
< PROPMALE > Bergeron . 
< PROPFIRST > Bowman\ 
You are evil . \ 
that is all . 
I'm nobody ! Who are you ? \ 
Are you nobody , too ? \ 
Then there's a pair of us -- don't tell ! \ 
They'd banish us , you know . \ 
How dreary to be somebody ! \ 
How public , like a frog\ 
To tell your name the livelong day\ 
To an admiring bog ! 
Everybody's out to get me but I feel alright\ 
Everybody's thinkin ' ' bout me ! 
Gooooooood Morning . 
< PROPFEMALE > Coogle is the Liopleurodon to my Jurassic age ! 
< PROPFEMALE > Coogle is the Materia to my Final fantasy VII ! 
< PROPFEMALE > Coogle is the Pikachu to my Pokémon yellow ! 
Of course it would rain when I wanted to go outside yesterday ! 
Went to the shelter , and adopted a dog ! Her name is < PROPFEMALE > ! <3 
\Are you insinuating that Kuwabara /isn't/ the champion of love ? \"" 
SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO I saw a scene kid today and thought of < PROPMALE > Royalty . 
Feels terrible . 
This is only the tip of the iceburg ;\ 
A wolf's head has the ability to bite even after it's been cut off . 
Thank you media for spreading the inflated egos of everyone here in the states ; meanwhile the bitter rebellion is plotting ! 
Taking care of my sick baby . Poor thing </3 
I'm pretty sure that I have the flu . . . and when I am going to be leaving tomorrow : ( 
Departing for Oklahoma . :3 
Back to the old grind :P 
Sometimes I feel that maybe I'm the only one that avoids music videos because music should be enjoyed as books ; creating the images of your own accord .
