another sleepless night -_- 

So I got kicked out of my house ... if anyone would be willing to keep me for at least a lil bit , please let me know 
So after a long talk with my parent's I'm back home , guess I'm glade I was out for only one night 
Getting a puppy late september , he'll be only 5 weeks old 
gonna beat the shit outta the fucker who finds it funny to change my facebook around 
so the usb ports on my ps2 are useless , so much for using my drums on guitar hero ... 
I'll be the first to say that now I'm ok , and for the first time I've opened up my eyes , this was my worst love , you'll be the first to go , and when she leaves you for dead , you'll be the last to know ... 
I get to keep my car ! :) 
zombieland was awesome , I recommend it for anyone with a sense of humor :) 
bourbonnais fire department called me back , I have an orientation Wednesday :) 
Modern Warfare 2 tonight at midnight ! :) 
Momento Mori is one of th best cd's I've evr listend to 
wondering how this christmas party with the jaffe boys is gonna go ... well only one way to find out ... 
just sitting at home enjoying my day off 
so I was wondering ... < PROPFIRST > cullen ... does he poop ? 
finally have windows 7 on my pc , and all I can say is it hella lot better then vista , nuff said 
so < PROPMALE > is the new < PROPFEMALE > male of the house ... found it out after he kicked the shit out of < PROPMALE > 
back from the dentist and now I have to go to work , sadly they told me I can't eat until my mouth gets feeling back ... I haven't eaten yet ... 
so the sd card virizon sold me for my phone is read only ... so I have to put rapsody on my computer so I can send files through my phone ... they can kiss my ass I hate rapsody ... >.> 
Have you ever noticed Friday is so far away from Monday yet Monday is so close to Friday ? 
can't sleep :( 
OMG < PROPFEMALE > ... WHO IS THE FATHER !? O.o 
< PROPMALE>'s inferno in 24 hours , I can't wait to play :) 
I'm hating the new facebook , it made my extension on google chrome useless -_- 
grilled cheese and tomato soup will always be delicious in the winter :) 
trying to beat < PROPMALE>'s inferno on the inferno difficulty ... I made it to limbo so far ... 
its 36 degrees out , why the hell is it snowing !? 
so I found the OTHER < PROPFEMALE > volkoff ... and she looks like a bitch .... just sayin 
so I deleted all of my computers system restore points except for the most recent ones ... and I got 30 gigs back of hard drive yey me ? 
and so the fun of learning how to use sony vegas begins ... 
decided to go with the cheaper speakers , and I'm lovin them :) 
question of the day ... the man who discovered milk ... what was he doing to that cow ? O.o 
Decided to try getting back into sword of the new world 
taxes are done , I only owe the state $12 :) 
probably not sleeping tonight ... hopefully < PROPFIRST > wont have too much work for me at jaffe's 
I'm wishing I had more people to play sword of the new world with 
so it turns out I got skrewed out of three hours of work , yey me -_- 
today was a good day for a walk :) 
well I really fucking hate our cops in this area ... I lock my keys in my car by accident over at < PROPFEMALE>'s bourbonnais wont do anything even though they are right now the road but the trailer park is county property , and county wont do anything because its not a life threatening emergency ... so why the hell do my tax dollars have to pay for these assholes ?

We have our new dog and she if friggin cute , gonna post some pics 
pics of the dogs are up , go check them out :)

tenneesse was fun , but oddly enough I'm glad to be back workin at jaffe's 
well great ... dumbass me left my windows down , now I have to wait for the seats to dry ._.
