I did not post any videos !!! I am contacting FB - I got hit with someone else's posted video ( with a virus ) , so BEWARE ! 
The same people who are always complaining about not being respected are the same people that act like idiots and continue to do the same things over and over again ... imagine that . 
waking the fox ? What was that < PROPFIRST > ? 
loves smartboard 
If regional orchestra gets cancelled due to weather , I will be really annoyed ... I have spent all of my free time FOR THE LAST MONTH helping these kids learn this music !!! 
Dear < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > , & < PROPMALE > , < PROPMALE > ! 
We were the people on the OTHER side of the line last night for fireworks ! HA ! 
23 days .... 
16 more days of running around like a chicken with my head chopped off .... 
Another headless chicken day .... 
Heritage Orchestra concert Tuesday night , 7 PM at HHS 
Menchville & Gildersleeve Orchestra Concert , Thursday night , 7:30 PM at MHS 
< PROPMALE > has a horrible cold ... He had to endure a ehearsal this morning for Christmas < PROPFEMALE > and the last musical performance at church tonight . Church tomorrow & one more performance , poor guy !!! :( 
Why are we in school today ?????? 
Okay ... guess I have a bad attitude ... just jealous of those other schools ! 
I love the last day before the winter break . Everyone is so happy ! Me , too - 30 minutes to go !!! 
< PROPFEMALE > ryone is invited to our Chirstmas < PROPFEMALE > service at Langley Baptist Church , 7 pm , 116 E Little Back River Road , Hampton , VA . The Christmas story , awesome singers ( < PROPFIRST > & Horacetta ) , a great orchestra - All are invited ! 
The first day back from vacation is always rough ... 
Okay , day 2 after vacation didn't go so well either : woke up late , pulled that muscle between the neck and shoulder BEFORE I left the house this morning - therefore , since it was my LEFT side , it was horrible . I tune instruments , drive , & reach for everything with my left arm even though I write with my right . Maybe tomorrow will be a good day ? 
Thank you , Horacetta and < PROPFIRST > , for a nice lunch ! Happy 3 day weekend ! 
< PROPFIRST > is a chicken . Cluck , cluck ... LOL 
Attention Peninsula Youth Orchestra Alumni , we are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the PYO this spring and would like to invite all alumni to perform and/or attend the spring the concert . Please contact me if this involves you ! 
@#$$%%^^&&**( ! @#$% !!!!!!!!! 
Why am I up ??? 
Rumanian Folk Dances or The Last Spring ????? 
< PROPFIRST>'s Day is hell in middle school . I'm home and still on fire . 
< PROPMALE > is watching < PROPMALE > Birdman AGAIN ... 
' s head almost popped off ! 
Things are a little insane at the moment . There is too much going on ! 
What a month !!! I cannot wait until February is over !!! 
Thank you all for the birthday wishes !!! Does anyone know where the fountain of youth is ? If so , I will pay handsomely ! 
Congratulations to < PROPFEMALE > Thibodeau , a former student - She has earned a full ride to JMU for music < PROPMALE > ! AWESOME ! 
Happy Easter !!! 
I hate it when people tell you only half of a secret ! 
Okay , I am happy . I found out the other half :) 
So this woman(talking on her cell phone ) and her middle-school aged kid are walking down the street while I am waiting for the light to change . The light turns green , the woman and her kid step out in front of my car and proceed really slowly in front of me , oblivious to the fact that the light is green and I have been sitting there for like 8 minutes . What would you have done ? 
Okay , Delius . Beautiful but very sad cello music . 
Passing through < PROPFEMALE > - I'm making it sound as of that takes 5 minutes - HA ! 
About an hour away from Epcot ;) 
Tonight I am greatful that I am sleeping in a hotel in a nice , comfy bed , and NOT tossing twisting on a hot bus like last night !!! 
We got to Magic Kingdom early-early enough to see the opening ceremony !!! It was AWESOME ! The only bad thing is that one of my students has a little touch of a stomach bug . We are in First Aid and now she is napping . She was so excited to come here ! She was a little upset . Hope she gets well soon so she can have some fun . 
I slept most of the day and evening yesterday and I am still tired . Ugh . 
I feel like the guy in my pic ! ( Here's something for you to laugh at , HB ! ) 
I really hate it when I explain why I am doing something and then the person who I explained it to goes against my wishes . The result is what I said would happen ( duh ) . ** sigh ** 
Why am I still at school ??? 
I really like my high school kids . We had a pleasant , productive learning day ! 
I really hate it when people use e-mail to vent their frustrations , insult & embarrass other people . People say things in e-mails that they would never dare say to anyone's face . AND , as if the person was not already behaving outrageously , the offender today waited approximately three months to vent ! It was not directed at me , but I was stilled quite annoyed . REDICULOUS ! 
It is so hot here at the ' sleeve ... figures , it's Monday . 
Why is there so much drama in the world ? My high school kids could have their own soap . How about As the Bass Spins , or Guiding Baton , or Measures of Our Lives ... LOL 
Ugh . Punch me in the face , as < PROPFIRST > would say . Now please . 
Not to be cliche , but TGIF !!!!!!!!! 
m-a-n-o-rrrraaaa 
Train wreck in progress , right on schedule . 
Peninsula Youth Orchestra 5oth Anniversary Concert at 3 PM , Orcutt Baptist Church on < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > in Newport News ( off of Oyster Point right by the Yoder Barn ) . The concert will feature Alumni performing with the orchestra students ! Come out and celebrate ! 
GREAT CONCERT EVERYONE !!! 
Really , it's only Tuesday ??? This has to be the longest week on record ... 
sick . what fun . with music in the parks tomorrow , busch gardens saturday , and concerts next week i'm sure to have a blast . 
When one is ill , doesn't feel well , has a cold , etc ., nobody really cares if you continue working right through it as if everything was normal . If one begs off , calls-in , then everyone thinks that person is either being whiney or a liar . In music , if one doesn't show up whether sick or not , no one will trust you again . 
\Why didn't my baby get first chair ?????? \ " AAAAARRRRGGGGHHHHHHH !!!!!!!! " 
This cold is really bad . I think it is turning into bronchitis or walking pneumonia . Ugh . I am because I am wheezing really badly again . 
The Gildersleeve Music Department took 1st place and superior ratings in every category in the Music in the Parks competition .... We also won Best Overall trophies ..... Our Kids Rock !!!!!! 
Wow . I really feel bad , and I have a lot of work to do . :-( 
Wow - almost can't believe June is here . May had so many events and performances that I wasn't keeping track of the dates ! June will be a whirlwind , too ! 
: ( 
90 more minutes , then FREEDOM ! \ 
Well , at least until Monday ;-) 
The Greek Festival was fun , but it is entirely too hot to do anything outside but swim ! Glad to be indoors :-) 
I really don't like Robot Chicken . Ick . 
I don't know who said this , but I agree : Integrity is what one does when no one else is watching . 
Church should be really fun today : trying lead with no voice and do the words/sound at the same time . < PROPFEMALE > haw ! 
Three more days with KIDS !!! :-) 
TWO !!! 
OOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNNNNNEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
So this morning I was thinking about all the last days of school I have had as a teacher , and something crazy always happens . ( Those of you close friends know about the whole dead bird thing , etc ... ) I am hoping and praying for a calm day ! 
ZZZZZZZZZZZEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOO !!!!!! 
If only every day could be a day at the beach ... 
Lions and tigers and bears - OH MY ! 
“You can close your eyes to the things you do not want to see , but you cannot close your heart to the things you do not want to feel . ” 
So sleepy ! 
Downtown tunnel traffic :-( 
Every time I think I can get ahead on work .... I realize I was behind and I will be lucky to KEEP UP . HA . Ironic , eh ? 
People should really stop smoking crack !!!!!!!! 
saying goodbye is never easy 
I actually finished writing my music history exam a full 2 days ahead of time - not at midnight the night before !!! ;-) 
3 & 3/4 days left of Summer Institute - but who's counting ??? ;-) 
SIA final performance tonight at 7 PM , Woodside High School . Only a few more hours , and IT'S ALL OVER !!! YAHOO !!! 
Time burglars stink :-( 
One school day down , only about 190 more to go ! LOL , I am just grateful to only be at two schools this year ! 
42 students in orchestra at MHS :-) 
Not that I don't like my job , but Monday is crawling by :-( 
Peninsula Youth Orchestra's first open rehearsal of the season is tonight from 6 to 8 PM - All string students from elementary through age 25 can join the PYO . Come to a rehearsal and try it out ! We are looking for wind players who can perform grade 5 & 6 music , especially oboe , french horn & tuba . Our nest open rehearsal will be next Monday night , same time , same place . 
Nice day - celebrating my sister's birthday : Crackerbarrel , Two parks , and shopping for junk at the drugstore ! Ending the day with a great old friend :-) 
Some people ... ugh 
:-) 
Oh my goodness ... I know kids get nervous at auditions , but ... < PROPFEMALE > GADS !!! 
I am so proud of my Menchville kids - 8 kids + 1 Alternate in Senior Regional Orchestra : 4 students in the symphony ( full orchestra ) , 4 students in the concert orchestra ( strings only ) and 1 1st alternate on bass ! I say this as if it is was all over - only half-way . Now we have to learn the music for seating auditions at the event ! 
I feel a chill in the air ... brrr ! Yay ! 
Today is not starting well .... Middle school is the ARMPIT of the educational system ... 
Espresso + Benedryl equals ? Will let you know ! 
grading recorded chair tests ... i still hate homework 
is getting ready for middle school district orchestra auditions . UGH 
Anyone want to help tune before Thursday's concert ? Do I need to bribe you ? 
Few words can really capture the greatness of < PROPFEMALE > Hansen . To me she was a teacher , mentor , and role model . She accomplished so much in her lifetime ; she made a difference . I pray for comfort and peace for her and her family . 
XM radio can be used for good or evil . < PROPMALE > Moyer uses it for evil ! 
* sigh * 
Teacher workday :-) 
Wow . Longest week ever . Good thing I like my job . 
My head hurts ... 
Lions and tigers and bears , OH MY !!! 
The copier died while I was running off sub lesson plans :( 
Some people need to be told that they are not nice . 
176,000 < PROPMALE >

So what are the chances the kids actually practiced over the break ? They have chair tests today ;-) so I guess I will find out ! 
Sometimes I feel like I have lived three days in one day . 
Prayer Request : < PROPMALE>'s dad is back in Grand View Hosp . with same symptoms as the Mini-stroke he had end of Oct . Nobody knows what's going on . 
Snow ! :-) 
And this week , we have visiting with us , Mr. Sinus Infection . He will be getting a surcharge for not making a reservation or leaving a check-out date . He is a jerk ! 
Is inviting all of you to come out and see an amazing concert tomorrow ! Orchestra at 6:30 , choir and orchestra at 7:15 and choir alone at 8:00 . We will be performing the Mozart Solemn Vespers . All this , and FREE ADMISSION !!! ;-) 
Thanks to my friends and family for attending the concert last night . I wish I could have seen you after the concert , but it was crazy with all the people !

Who shot < PROPFIRST > ? 
We had a very exciting morning service : the advent candles set the advent wreath on fire during the morning hymns ! < PROPMALE > was the first one to notice , so he ran for the fire extinguisher . Poof ! It was out , and we went on with the service ! 
Wishes I had stayed up to see the eclipse . 
< PROPMALE > is driving to < PROPFEMALE > . I am riding ! He's such a good guy ! 
Pictures below of the < PROPFEMALE > countryside , on our way to Boyertown . 
Congrats to < PROPFEMALE > Thibodeau , a former student , who was in the chamber orchestra at JMU and auditioned for the Symphony Orchestra and made PRINCIPAL SECOND VIOLIN !!! Woohaaa !!! I am so proud of you , WB ! 
Don't you hate it when people don't do what they say they are going to do ? Really ? They keep asking you what do you want , you tell them , then they do whatever they want .! @#$%& ?? / : @#%% **?// : 4#@ ! $& *?////* &%$3@ !! 
Working on a Saturday-my favorite thing ! 
Symphonicity tonight and I am already tired ... 
Snow flurries ! 
No classes this morning ;-) 
Meeting after lunch plus lights out to view the Smartboard equals SLEEPY SLEEPY < PROPFEMALE > 
* hack * * cough * UGH 
BOO !!! 
My mom is bringing me soup ;-) moms are great that way . 
I need the wheezing and the nausea to GO AWAY !!! 
I hate writing music . Sight-reading music for all city specifically . It's okay if it is completely atonal , right ? 
What is so wrong about wanting a 2 hour delay ? 
Has anyone noticed ? The sign in front of Warwick High School has a misspelled word : \cultual\ " LOL " 
TGIF ! Beautiful weather today ! :-) 
People don't mostly don't make permanent changes in behavior . I think as people age , their characteristics become more intense and extreme , and the irony is people think they really have changed ! 
I really wish tomorrow was a day off \ 
:-( 
One can only control two things in life : one's actions and reactions . Everything else is out of bounds . 
Is it 3:00 yet ? 
Performance Assessment , oh how I hate being thy chairman . Next year it is someone else's turn . 
Long day yesterday , but at least it is OVER ! I actually enjoy my kids performing-they all did great : GMS , grade III music , All Superiors ; MHS grade V , All Superiors ; MHS grade < PROPFEMALE > , All Superiors . It is all of the fact that even though I am the chair , on the day of , I am to busy with my groups to do the make sure everything runs smoothly . Thanks to my awesome student and two great friends for representing me all day ! 
What is up with the kids this week ? They are being so friggin lazy and sassy !!! I don't fuss that much , but when I have asked the kids continually to get on task , that is it . I know festival is over , but the school year is not ! 
Arrive at DMV at 7:50 - it opens at 8 am . There are 35 people in front of me and 15 behind me and it is not even 8 am ! I hope I won't have to act crazy like the last time I was here ! 
10 school days until spring break ! I am ready ! 
Thanks to all ! It's nice to be 22 again ! ( You can laugh ! ) 
OKAY , a kid today told me he was feeling sick , so I say , go to the clinic or the bathroom . He goes into the instrument storage room and vomits on the floor . What do you think I said ? \ 
A . Poor baby\ 
B . What is wrong with you ? Why in the world did you not go to the restroom ? \ 
C .! #@%& *?// 
Teachers who don't give their kids music before all city need to ! @#$%& **// !!!!!! 
Calm blue ocean , calm blue ocean , calm blue ocean ... 
One more week before spring break !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
The never-ending Friday ... 
Did anyone else hear sleet hitting their Windows this morning ( in the Tidewater area) ? 
Five days :-) 
I really hate it when people make excuses for not doing their jobs . 
Tttthhhrrrrrreeeeeeee more dddaaaayyyyyssssss 
Five classes left , and one more fundraiser to count !!! 
In case you can't tell from my daily FB status I CAN'T WAIT FOR SPRING BREAK ! 
This sounds insane , but I love getting up early on a Saturday morning . It's so quiet and peaceful-even the cats are still sleeping ! It's really nice when you don't have to go anywhere or do anything ... then you can take a nap at 8:30 am ;-) 
Why do I agree to these things ?????? 
The weather is beautiful in < PROPFEMALE > Florida ;-) 
VA Beach 5th Grade All City concert at Sandler Center today . No rehearsal time before-it's tune and go ! Hopefully , they will remember everything we did yesterday ! 
What a way to end spring break-I had horrible dreams all night : zombies , being taken hostage , arguing with people ... hopefully this is not an indication of the week to come . 
Deadline ... due date ... this is the last day ...! @#$%^&* 
No cello lesson today ;-) 
I think there are invisible little imps hammering on my forehead ... 
Some people never learn their lesson . 
In a funk . Hopefully it will wear off at 3:00 ! 
:-( Friday traffic 
Very sleepy ... zzzz ... zzz .. z ... z 
I think I left half of my brain at home today . 
Some people are just BIG FAT LIARS . 
Does Music in the Parks give out \POOR\ " ratings ??? "
