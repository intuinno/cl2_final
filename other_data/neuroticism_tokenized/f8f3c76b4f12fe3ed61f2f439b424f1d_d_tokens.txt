My daughter < PROPFEMALE > , will be turning 21 on Friday ! Ughh , I'm getting old !! 

To truly forgive is to love ... \

Hubby is home on vacation for 2 wks . He goes back to work June 14th and shortly after he goes back to work , I will be making more photo albums . 
... my hubby went back to work today , and I miss him already :( 
It's HAILING , here in June ! Ughh !! 
.... I decided today is a good day to write emails , letters , and make phone calls to old friends , ( or just phone calls ) . I hope everyone has an AWESOME Monday ! 
... \ 
Out of all the things I lost ... I miss my mind the most ;) . 
A true friend doesn't care if you're broke , if your house is a mess , about your past , or if your family is full of loonies . They love you for you . A true friend can go long periods of time without speaking and when you do talk , it's like there was no space . They never question the ... friendship .... Post this if you're lucky enough to have ... at least one of these friends ... they will know who they are !!! 
I decided ... IT SUCKS BEING SOBER ... but somebody's got to do the job , right ? 
Read it on a friends wall/post and I wanted to pass it on ... \ 
\Friends Never Make Assumptions About You\

I have carried a child within my body . I have comforted a baby upon my chest . My body isn't magazine perfect , but when I look in the mirror I see a Mother and there is no greater honor or Blessing ! ? 
~ * ~ Reminder ~ * ~ \ 
If you don't like my pictures , please don't look at them . If you don't like what I have to say , please don't read what I write . Yes I'm having family sharing my info to other people that shouldn't be reading or looking at my photos . Please give me the respect of NOT sharing my info to those I do NOT want seeing/reading my stuff . Thank you <3 
I decided a person can lead a horse to it's water , but they can't make it drink it . You can only help those that want the help . 
I have nightmares , ( especially this time of year ) , every night ... when will they stop ? 
Life Is Too Short To Wake Up With Regrets ... So Love The People Who Treat You Right ... Forgive Those Who Don't & Believe That Everything Happens For A Reason !! Take Your Chances ... Nobody Said It Would Be Easy ... They Just Promised It Would Be Worth It !! <3 Thnx Kat <3 
... Mean people suck ! 
Why do people lie ? 
I decided I hate my dinasour computer ! I can't wait until my \newer\ " one gets back .. " 
psst ! Hey you , the one with the mouse in your hand at the computer . Ya I'm talking to YOU ! Guess what ? You are reading my status . :) 
Today the Lord took my dad away from us . He wasn't the greatest man on earth but he was a hero to many . May he rest in peace . I love you dad ! I miss you terribly ! <3 <3 <3 
I loved you the minute I heard your heart beat . I Loved you the minute you were born . Then I saw your face & fell in love some more . You were only a minute old but I knew I would die for you , & to this day I still would . When you choose to have a child you make a conscious decision to allow your heart to walk around ou ... tside of your body . Put this on your status if you have children you love more than life ! ? 
If you have a man who helps balance your whole world ... who ISN'T perfect , but perfect for you ... who works VERY hard and would do most ANYTHING for you ... makes you laugh and drives you crazy .. who IS your bestes friend ... and who you are thankful for everyday , then post this as your status ? I LOVE YOU MY DEAR HUBBY ? 
I'm wondering .... 
Time for me to go to DREAMLAND ... good night everyone :) 
A friend will stick up for you and calm you down when your mad , but a best friend will skip along-side of you , with a shovel , giggling ... \someones gonna get it ! \"" 
thinks you cause unnecessary drama , because your life is boring and dull , and without moronic drama you'd have nothing to talk about . 
It's FRIDAY and my hubby is OFF for the next 8 days ~ Whoo Hoo !! And 10 days my son comes out to visit !! Double Whoo Hoo !!!! 
I think we should honor the dead because if it wasn't for people like < PROPFIRST > Washington , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , etc , than we wouldn't have a better country to honor the living . 
The LOVE of a parent for their children can NOT be stopped by walls , laws , morals , and < PROPMALE > . It will always be present in their life regardless of the circumstances !! 
If we are what eat , then I'm a Fruity Fish ... what are you ? 
You and I wake up in jail together ... Using only FOUR words , what would you say to me ? NOTE : if you comment , you gotta copy and paste this in your status so I can comment on yours 
The < PROPFEMALE > has moved to another place , so the sun can shine upon your face , may you be blessed with a day that's full of God's perfect grace ! (( HUGS )) 
When you judge someone else , it doesn't define who they are , it defines who you are ! 
I had an emotional day , ( I added a friend's daughter which meant the world to me ~ love you < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > ) , along a busy day running errands ... so I'm calling it a night . Good night everyone ! Sweet dreams !! <3 <3 <3 
It still amazes me how quickly my children have become my whole heart and soul . I live for them and I'd easily die for them . Nothing will ever compare ! 
If you love something , set it free ... if it comes back , it's yours and if doesn't , it never was . ~ * ~ Good things come to those who awaits ~ * ~ 
\Tough times never last 
Ok ... it's time for me to head to my mammogram ... ughh !! 
Time to cook dinner , puree the pumpkin for my pumkin pie ... everyone have a good evening ! 
~ Dear Week , You are not attractive and I am leaving you for Weekend . I would say it wasn't you and that it was me , but I can't lie and yes it was you ... 
It's time for me to get ready to head to the Seattle area ... everyone have a good Friday ! 
When you really want to slap someone , do it and say there was a \mosquito\ " on your cheek . " 
I've got a REALLY stupid question and if ANY one knows the answer , PLEASE comment on this post . How do you cook a turkey ??? I NEVER made one myself and I've gotta make one this Thanksgiving ...

My friends has made me laugh . Wiped my tears . Hugged me tight . Watched me succeed . Seen me fail . Cheered me on . Kept me going strong . My friends are a promise from God that I will have a friends forever . Put this as your status if you love your friends ! God sent me a lot of great friends ... 
And the baking begins !!! Pies , pies , and more pies ! ~ Whoo hoo !!! I LOVE to bake ! 
Not everyone can \hear\ " what a person is saying . The < PROPMALE > of good communication is actually \ " listening\ " to what a person is saying . You can SAY something in more than one way ... " 
I HATE this emotional roller coaster ride that comes with Peri Menopause !!!!! I don't know if I should cry , laugh , yell , or sing ???? 
I think I'll call it a night cuz I have a long drive tomorrow ... THANK YOU EVERYONE for being \there\ " for me :) " 
every time you look back , you miss out on something in front of you . 
An angry person will open his/her mouth and close his/her eyes & ears . A wise person will open his/her eyes & ears and close his/her mouth .

would rather be told the truth and it hurt a little than be lied to or ignored and it hurt a lot ! I wish everyone would say what they mean and mean what they say ! 
I think these next few dayz & nights would be nice to just snuggle and cuddle with someone ! or in my case ... turn up the heat on the waterbed and add another blanket ! LOL ! 
Don't Need An Angel On My Christmas Tree . I Already Have One In Heaven Looking Down On Me . Put This As Your Status If There Is Someone In Heaven You Will Miss This Christmas ? ? 
thinks we should all jump out of our chairs and do the 5 second happy dance ! 1-2-3 READY ... GO !

I want to go for a drive !! But I CAN'T! Nothing like being \trapped\ " in your own home ! "

It's been a LLLOOONNNNGGG weekend and I'm gonna be glad tomorrow arrives , ( though it's a Monday ) . Everyone have a good night and sweet dreams ~ > I know I will !! 
I decided to attempt my first Key Lime pie , ( after I take a nap) !! After the key lime pie , I'm baking an apple pie ... both will be made from scratch ! As you can probably guess , I'm feeling much better , ( like a mountain has been lifted off my shoulders) ! 
Friends are Gods way of showing Us that we don't have to walk alone , and I have a lot of great friends ! =)

I really/truly dislike filling out paperwork ! Yuck & Ughh !! But somebody's gotta do it . 
Tired of trying to find the right words just so you know that I am hurt and I know it doesn't matter to most people . 
Therapy helps , but screaming obscenities is cheaper !! and it's funnier to watch how people react to it ~ tee < PROPFEMALE > . 
I guess it's time for me to go do something ... even if it's wrong ;) . 
Finished paperwork ~ > Whoo hoo !!! Now time to sort & pack , ( sniffle sniffle ) . I got 18 days to move out ... 
Dear < PROPFEMALE > ~ > For Christmas I only have 1 ( one ) , wish . I already have my health , 3 beautiful & smart kids on their way to success & happiness to make this a better world to live in , my divorce I've put off for 2yrs , and please know I'm not asking for money , or anything tangible . But my wish I can not say and it can only be granted by you or God , and it's something I've wanted all my adult life ... ~ HeiSon

Forgive & forget is the only way to live without pain from the past , but if you still feel pain after forgiving , than you haven't really forgiven at all . 
There is NOT one perfect person on this earth , but there is always that one perfect person for everyone <3<3<3 ~ > Mine is < PROPMALE > the Frog , ( tee < PROPFEMALE > ) . 
Have you ever noticed how the words \We need to talk\ " can cause a man to go from a smile to a look of pure panic and confusion in just a few seconds ? ;) . " 
This is humble of me to ask , especially since I \swiped\ " it off a 17yr old's wall & I need some1 to please explain it becuz I've seen it a few times ... \ 
Most people have 1000 wishes for Christmas ; a cancer patient only has one ; to get better . I know 97% of you won't repost this to your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do .

Do you know the < PROPMALE > word for bra is ... it's \Stopemfromfloppen \"." 
It's amazing how ONE phone call can ruin someone's ENTIRE WEEK !!! 
Note ~ > When we perceive a danger of being hurt , the fight mechanism of anger helps to ensure our protection . \\ 
... and my nightmares are back . Woke up 3 or 4 times last night , but woke up a few minutes ago yelling my dad's name :( 
This too , will pass ! Courage is fears that has said it's prayers ... courage is fears that has said it's prayers ... COURAGE IS FEARS THAT HAS SAID IT'S PRAYERS !! and THIS TOO WILL PASS !! 
I think therefore I am confused . 
Sometimes ... What's left unsaid speaks the loudest , so please just say it and stop me from guessing , because I have a WILD imagination . 
I am stuck on band aid , cuz band aids stuck on me ~ whoo hoo 
Watch it wiggle , see it giggle ... jello brand gelatin ~ Whoot there it is =} 
Did my shopping , ( groceries ) , baked 2 pies , watched my movie , got my clothes ready for tomorrow , and now ... I'm gonna call it a night . I got a busy day tomorrow :)

The Christmas Gift of Knowing You ~ \ 
The Christmas season fills our hearts w/joy ;\

About our finest blessings all yr through\ 
We focus on our family & our friends\ 
And appreciate the gift of knowing u ! \
