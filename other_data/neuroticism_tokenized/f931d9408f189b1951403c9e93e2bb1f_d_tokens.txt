I posted some new photos of our western trip last July , check them out ! 

I posted Some new Ireland photos . Check them out . 
Today I started tearing out our old kitchen floor . We are replacing it with tile . This should keep me busy for a while . 
Kitchen remodel update . The carpet and pad and underlayment are out . I am now putting down the cement board . Then I can finally get to laying the tile . 
Almost finished tiling the kitchen floor . Removed old floor and laid tile last week . Grouted the floor today . Now just have to seal the grout , then we can move the stove and fridge back . They have been in our front hall for the last two weeks . 
The kitchen floor is done . Time to move on to the next project . 
Got tired of my same old facebook photo . 
< PROPFEMALE > is awesome she helped me with tiling all day . 
Helped Dad get his study organized today . We built a file cabinet today . Still have one more to make and a desk too . 
I just realized both of my kids have facebook photos of themselves wallowing around in the mud . I'm not sure what to think . LOL

Just got back from seeing the movie Avatar ( in 3D ) . I was really cool . Excellent 3D . The plot is a bit preditcable but the planet Pandora is beautiful . In my opinion it's a movie worth watching , esp . if you like sci-fi movies . 
Looking forward to seeing < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > . Happy Holidays to everyone ! 
Finished the drive to New Jersey yesterday . Looking forward to spending a few days with < PROPMALE > , < PROPFIRST > and family . 
Looking forward to getting together with relatives today . 
Heading out on a road trip to visit family and friends .

Had a nice visit with Sanya and < PROPFIRST > last night . Looking forward to seeing < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE > in Savanah tomorrow . 
The cold weather seems to follow us where ever we go . We have enjoyed the southern hospitality of < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPMALE > in Savanah GA this past weekend . It is even getting too cold for us Michigangers here in Savanah so we are headed further south to Bradenton Florida today . We will leave them in peace to warm up here while we take this cursed cold to some other unsuspecting family . 
Home sweet home . It's great to be home . 
Brewing a batch of < PROPFEMALE > Stout beer . 
Done painting , yeah !

Bottled beer today . Now just have wait 2-3 weeks till it is ready to taste . 
It is amazing to me , that I get a better ATT signal in the upper reaches of the Upper Peninsula where we don't even have electricity than I do in Midland MI !

Quote from < PROPFEMALE > We dont have a < PROPMALE > at this bar trivia contest with this table of Chinese next to us 
Me maybe the category will be American history 
Got this from someone else on Facebook and liked it : This year we will experience 4 unusual dates : 1/1/11 , 1/ 11/11 , 11/1/11 , and 11/11/11 ... now go and take the last 2 digits from the year you were born and the age you will be this year and it will equal 111 . Who has the time to think up this stuff ? Very cool
