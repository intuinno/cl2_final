Woohoo :) I'm so happy ... I just passed my pharm tech class and got 50 CEUs for it .. Now I just have to take the certification exam and be certified ... and maybe finally get a decent job :-p 
Yay ! Holiday weekend ! Woohoo ! 
Dogsitting , and a concert tomorrow , woohoo ! 
Yay , it's finally the weekend 
Why is it I can receive gifts but not send out anything from the gift apps ? The friends box is missing each time ... I've tried refreshing the < PROPFEMALE > , but it doesn't work . 
Grrr ... been trying to send things with gift apps and again the friends box won't show up ! So I am getting gifts but not usually able to send any back :( 
Yay , Friday ! 
Saturday ( today ) is Enchilada Day ! 
Still don't think it's fair ... My friend who has already seen Metallica 18 times gets to leave work early tomorrow to go see them in < PROPMALE > . I think he should give his second-row ticket to me for my birthday ! What a great present that would be ! 
Dogsitting , picking out pumpkins , renewing my license , and doing who knows what else today ..... woooo .... 
Thanks for all the birthday wishes ! I had fun over the weekend , and it was back to work today ... 
* Still * can't send gifts in some apps ... grrrr ... 
I can't send gifts in these apps ( and probably others too ): Barn < PROPMALE > , FarmVille , birthday zoo , Friends for Sale . I can send YoVille gifts if you send me what you want . I can only send it back as a ' thank you ' gift . If you send me a gift somewhere where I can't send a gift , I will try to send you something in another app ... Facebook really needs to straighten this crap out ! 
Happy < PROPFEMALE > de los Muertos ! 
Saw the movie ' Where the Wild Things Are ' - both sad and funny 
Making more of my spicy authentic gringa enchiladas ... lol 
Why do I keep getting messages about automation ? What the heck is FB talking about ?? 
Well , I guess FB doesn't like me .. Suddenly almost everything I click on tells me it looks like I'm using automation and they're not letting me do anything ... 
woohoo , finally the weekend :) 
arf arf ... Time to walk over and let some rottweilers out :) 
what the heck is wrong with FB ??? now they appear to have wiped out my wall ... 
Yay , I'm finally home .. Time to turn my brain back on , bake some pumpkin pies , and have some hot tea :) Happy Turkey Day , everyone

TO MY NON-GAME-PLAYING FRIENDS : If you don't want to see posts from games , move your cursor over the game message and the word \Hide\ " will appear . Click on \ " Hide\ " for the game name - and not me ! - Future messages from that game will be hidden on your wall ! " 
I had 23 reward points and spent 5 ... How am I only left with 3 ????? Zynga needs math lessons !!! 
Off to 4-H , then a Skillet concert tonight :) 
No work today , no work tomorrow ... Who wants to go stand on the corner and collect $$$ for me ? haha 
Your Clan of 501 fought against Zynga with 1 Google Chrome Browser , 1 High-Speed Internet , 1 Dedicated Vamp Wars Addict , 100 Refresh clicks , 10 Browser Re-boots and 388 words of foul language ! You lost the fight taking your frustration out on your Laptop tossing it out the window in disgust . Copy and post everyone needs a laugh ! 
Yay , I have an interview ! Wish me luck :) 
I need tickets in VW . If you send me tickets , I will add your name to a revolving list and will be sending you tickets back as I gift . Keep sending ! 
VampWars : I'm done with Mandyland but still collecting tickets to get extra abilities . You send them , I'll return them 
Gone for the weekend -- Out of state for my grandpa's funeral + to see family ... Play nice , everybody ! 
I'm STILL in New York !! Crappy circumstances , but it's nice to see family + be off work for a while . 
Happy Tuesday , everybody ! ( This is Tues , right ? lol ) 
On my way back to Ohio . Nice weather today ! 
' Where is this ship headed ? ' was the question this morning @ work . It made me think I was still on FB in pirate mode .. Where is < PROPFEMALE > vessel bound ? An < PROPFEMALE > e ? LOL 
? ? ? TICK WARNING ! I hate it when people post bogus warnings , but this one is real . Please repost this as your status ! If someone comes to your front door saying they are checking for ticks due to the warm weather and asks you to take your clothes off and dance around with your arms up , DO NOT DO IT ! THIS IS A SCAM ! They only want to see you naked . I wish I'd gotten this yesterday . I feel so stupid .. ? ? ? 
Anyone got some tranquilizer darts handy ?? I need them .. I have at least 1 target ... 
It's way too nice to be at work ! What the heck am i still doing here ?? Lol 
Thunderstorms + tornados moving into the area ! Going to get offline + enjoy the storms ... 
What a nice day 2 b at a garage sale + not at work ! :) 
Inter-species transformation in progress . First my skin was red , + now i shed . Now to figure out whether the lobster is becoming a snake or a dragon ... 
I sent a message to some people about them being listed as users of Gamers Unite . This was only to figure out who was cheating , and to get those who are to hopefully stop ... So if you received this message , do not take it personally , it's just there is too much cheating + crap going on ! 
IMPORTANT :\ 
As of tomorrow , Facebook will creep into your bathroom when you're \ 
in the shower , fondle your butt , and pinch you in uncomfortable \ 
places . To change this option , go to Privacy Settings > Personal \ 
Settings > Bathroom Settings > Fondling + Pinching Settings and \ 
uncheck the Shenanigans box . Facebook kept this one quiet . Copy & \ 
paste on your status to alert the unaware ! 
Gotta love my job title lately : ' Stud inspector . ' LOL 
Grrr .. I try to send gifts in VampWars + right after I tell it to send , it says the < PROPFEMALE > doesn't exist anymore . So I don't think my gifts got sent . :( 
Yay , lunchtime ! Now if only this was Friday !! Lol 
Friday , halle-frickin-lujah ! :) Who else is glad it's Friday ? 
Vampire Wars is doing that thing again where it says the link has expired or can't be found when I try to send out gifts :( 
My browser and/or FB are doing funky things + not cooperating ... And I need sleep .. So I'm not sticking around long tonight ! 
I wish someone could have been so kind as to sound the MORON ALERT + warn me what kind of day this would be ! 
Didn't have time for facebook last night , + looks like there are nasty storms moving in soon -- I'll have to abandon ship after a while ! 
Zzzzzzz ... sleeping now 
Meow meow mrarr ... Busy catsitting , probably won't be around tonight . Going to actually take some time + do some reading :-) 
Still catsitting a cat that doesn't think he is a cat ... lol . Be back soon .. 
Why won't any of my MW stuff post ? + I haven't been able to post to the coffin wall in VW for more than 2 weeks now ! Anyone else having these issues ? 
Just iced 7 people on MW , wanted to ask for flux capacitors + help upgrading weapons + job assists ... Still can't post anything in MW ! This sucks :( 
Can I have a d o-o ver of the weekend ? With no humidity + abt 20 degrees cooler ? This weather really sucks :-( 
I'm having so much fun I might just ' polka ' my eye out ! Haha 
I just hate when real life interferes with my facebook life :-/ 
This could be interesting .... let's see how \ 
forthcoming my Facebook friends are ... Leave a one-word comment that you\

can only be one word . Then copy and paste this post on your wall , so I \ 
can leave a word about you . 
I still can't ring doorbells ... This has been going on for days now :-( 
Just spent hours bat hunting in my house + found no bat . He better not reappear + keep me awake again tonight :-( 
No time , + FB feeds keep messing up . Wouldn't let me post a lot of things . Hope to get somewhat caught up soon ! 
( to new friends -- ) I play games that generate a lot of posts . \ 
This can be irritating if you don't play . If you don't want to see \ 
these , move your cursor over the game message and the word \Hide\ " will \ 
Trying to get over the flu .. Exhausted but can't sleep .. This really sucks 
MW - slot machines on my wall to play ! \

I dream of having a job that matters , where people can help each other w/o worrying abt it , where u r appreciated , + the boss is not immovable . Am I dreaming ?
