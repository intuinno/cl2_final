Avatar vs . Sherlock Holmes - i saw both this week and could not decide which i liked better overall . in the end i have concluded that both movies are too different to compare - i must see both again before making anymore of a decision - haha :)

No , I'm not . 
pwned ^_^ 
listening to Scooter :D awesomeness 
blah 
I love you all , but no matter how good of a friend you are - I am still not planning farmville :) if i ever change my mind - i will tell you guys

stupid drivers complait # 1 = if the speed limit says 25 , then i am going to drive at 25 - so back off my bumper ! and if u didn't notice the sign telling the speed limit then learn to read or get off the road !!! 
stupid drivers complaint # 2 = at roughly around the same time each day something strange happens where the sky goes dark , you may have also noticed you cant see as well when this happens . No one else can see well either . TURN ON YOUR HEADLIGHTS ! 
Happy Easter ! 
done with finals ! 
listening to Epica :)

Is anyone interested in buying artwork from me ? I'm not gonna ask too much for any of it because I'm not a professional , but all together it takes up a lot of space so I need to get rid of some , and due to paint costs I thought I should at least try and make money off of it . haha :D If you're interested tell me and I'll post pictures . If you want something I don't have , tell me and I can paint/draw one just for you !

My computer is being stupid again so please no live chats - it completely freezes my computer 
alas , christmas songs are already stuck in my head :) 
only one more final 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas ! 
It takes 7 seconds for food to pass from mouth to stomach . A human hair can hold 3kg . The length of a penis is 3 times the length of the thumb . The femur is as hard as concrete . A woman's heart beats faster then a man's . Women blink 2x as much as men . We use 300 muscles just to keep our balance when we stand . The woman ... has read this entire text . The man is still looking at his thumb . Repost if this made you smile :) 
I hope happiness is contagious :) Otherwise I spent my whole work day thinking on this and coming to the conclusion that yes it is contagious , only to have reached to false conclusion . haha 
My first day of class is tomorrow ... Speaking of which does tomorrow have one or two ' r's ? I have always used two but my phone is convinced it has only one . 
I do not understand what is going on with the new zodiacs but I checked and I'm still Taurus :) Which thankfully means I can still have that Taurus keychain hahaha XD 
After going a week without internet I have come to realize what a ( mostly ) waste of time it is . 
Another good day :) 
The best moments seem to be a simple and refreshing few minutes of good air after a no t-t he-best day . 
You know that feeling of dumbfounded elation ? The best way to describe it is your brain fell out of intelligence into < PROPFEMALE > land and is now sitting there drinking from a kid's juice box and eating cookies while your face seems to be stuck with a permanent but genuine smile . Yup . That is me :) 
yep :) Life is good 
Yup yup :D Life is a very good thing 
:D 
Had an excellent weekend and is feeling better :) 
Hmm , it'd seem eating is good for you :) haha 
is extremely lucky :) 
I am staying in Bozeman for Spring Break :) 
Alas , I weep for humanity . There are a lot of sick and idiotic people in the world , and it would seem many of them work in the video game industry . 
I finally got Skype :) 
Yay :D 
so it is official : Here in a couple months it's back to TN for a visit !!! :D 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ( comedian ) was Awesome ! hahaha XD
