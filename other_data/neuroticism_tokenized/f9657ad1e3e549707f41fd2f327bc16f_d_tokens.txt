Wandered around Harajuku and Asakusa . 

and Ondine cannot go anywhere in Tokyo without some random Japanese guy speaking to us - in English- about Japanese social problems . 
Is back in Albuquerque - after delays ... including 2 and a half hours of mechanical failure 
has noticed there has been a rash of engagements/marriages of late . 
For those in < PROPFEMALE > and Europe , Happy New Year ! For those in the US Happy New Year's < PROPFEMALE > ! 
is doing nothing more than playing video games ... waiting for school to start again 
and Ondine are helping some Japanese girls from AIU . 
is starting classes tomorrow ... 
is Philosophizing 
' s look alike was found by Ondine ! 
insists that the uranium is just for ... \parties\ " . Honest . " 
laughs at the 27% of Americans who still support Obama - maybe it's for his ' bi-partisanship ' or ' fiscal responsibility ' ... 
victimizes the illogical , preys on the mentally unprepared . ( aka enjoys his Philosophy class ) 
, contrary to popular opinion , thinks that Heraclitus neither contradicts himself nor uses it as an illustrative method . 
weeps at the fact that the US income is around $3 Trillion and the new budget is $4.5 trillion ... T_T 
hates learning about all the chemical equations involved with geo-chemical weathering ... 
is really missing the video game bunch in the lobby ... that and getting tired of all the spammers online 
used a firearm for the first time yesterday ... and loved it ! Thank you US weapon laws ! 
musing of the day ... Ironic how , despite the labels of ' conservative ' and ' Liberal ' , the sides keep changing . The end result is that Obama supporters have ' changed ' the country , but that ' change ' is now status quo ! In other words , they are now the bitter conservatives protecting the status quo ( 56% of Americans ) while the ' conservatives ' are actually advocating change ! Funny , right ? 
finished a critique on Aristotle's virtue theory ... there were no survivors . 
is as he once was twice again ! 
wishes there were a truly great RPG to play ... XIII has an excellent battle system , but story is cliche and characters are weak ... XII was pretty bad all around ( perhaps little better than X-2 ) ... I'm thinking FFX was the best Final Fantasy created . 
not one republican voted for the Health Care < PROPMALE > ... if it succeeds , the democrats will get all the credit ... if it fails , they had better get all the blame . So much for bi-partisanship ( BOTH sides ) 
\The worst form of inequality is to try to make unequal things equal . \ " -Aristotle " 
hmph ! FFXIII pros : graphics and battle system cons : story , characters , and music 
\Democracy puts power in the hands of those least competent to use it . \ " -Socrates " 
it is a travesty that the only countries that have not ratified the 1989 < PROPFEMALE > convention on the rights of the child are the US and Somalia . Everyone , call your senator and lobby president Obama to have this treaty ratified . 
just finished FFVII . Truly an excellent game ... On to VIII ! 
* Sigh * the more I read , the more I agree with Plato and the less pro-democracy I become ... 
“The whole modern world has divided itself into Conservatives and Progressives . The business of the Progressives is to go on making mistakes . The business of the Conservatives is to prevent the mistakes from being corrected . ” - G.K. Chesterton 
A pessimist only sees the dark side of the clouds , and mopes An optimist doesn't see the well he is about to fall into because he is admiring the beauty of the sky . A philosopher sees both sides and shrugs 
pet peeve : I wish people would stop saying the term ' Hispanic ' without understanding what it means . Hispanics are those people who can trace their ancestry back to Spain ( and Europe ) without Native < PROPFEMALE > n blood who came to < PROPFEMALE > on the original conquests or were children of the original Spanish colonists of the New World . It is a HUGE cultural insult to Hispanics to call Mexicans and Latinos ' Hispanic ' . 
the floggings will continue until morale improves ... 
“The point of philosophy is to start with something so simple as not to seem worth stating , and to end with something so paradoxical that no one will believe it . ” -Bertrand < PROPMALE > 
... there is no ' dignified ' way to die . Death isn't dignified . We should concern ourselves on living with dignity . 
Woo Hoo ! done with my annotated bibliography . 4 more finals to go . 
... Finals ... 
\Philosophy consists very largely of one philosopher arguing that all others are jackasses . He usually proves it 
too true ... Obama IS more interested in policing our grocery stores and choice of foods than solving our border crisis . 
“Sensation tell us a thing is . Thinking tell us what it is this thing is . Feeling tells us what this thing is to us . ” - < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > 
Hah ! 3-0 ... Space marines and Imp Guard burn at my feet . That last one was scary tho ... nasty Armor Companies ... 
well , the irony is this : two weeks after he removed the ban on offshore drilling , the worst oil spill in US history happens . This combined with the pathetic government response ( they had oversight of all operations ) ... Obama is to blame for one of the biggest US environmental disasters in history . 
The problem with modern politics is this : the conservatives can't see the < PROPMALE > for all the trees and the liberals can't see the trees for the < PROPMALE > . 
is back from the New Mexico State Bar Convention in Ruidoso , NM . I learned lots about ethics , liability related to social networking sites , and Intellectual Property Law . 
is back from NYC . Broadway plays are really something else ... 
Arkham Asylum was actually a really good game ! Looking forward to Arkham City . 
is now level 21 ! Stats have increased ! 
Orks like to fight , tyranids want to eat , tau are communists , the \ 
Imperiaum is fascist , Chaos is anarchist , necrons are trying to \ 
retake over their empire , and eldar are trying to survive . The \ 
dark eldar just do things because they can ... 
The Atheist is bound by nothing - he has unrestrained freedom . He is under the power and limits of < PROPFEMALE > . The theist has power over freedom , choosing its limits and boundaries . 
Space < PROPFEMALE > rule #66 . Thou shalt not use the Lasgun as a flashlight . \ 
\ 
#179 . Thou shalt not brag about how many you've killed with a Dark Eldar . \ 
#225 . Thou shalt not nail Nurglings to the back of the rhino as fuzzy \ 
decorations . 
Space < PROPFEMALE > rule #71 . Lasguns don’t make cool disco lights for your party . 
is low on sleep and has too much to do tomorrow ... 
“The man who is a pessimist before forty-eight knows too much ; if he is an optimist after it he knows too little” - < PROPFIRST > Twain 
\Most men lead lives of quiet desperation\ " \ 
New . Dark . Eldar . Awesome . 
right now , the US is a kakistocracy . 
\It only takes 20 years for a liberal to become a conservative without changing a single idea . \ " - < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > " 
Good show , Brits ... now hand over that pesky Assange and we'll treat him to some ' American Hospitality . ' 
Snow day XD 
Epistemology ... is tough ... 
\The superior mind will find itself equally at odds with the evils of society and with the projects that are offered to relieve them . \ " - < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > " 
is present , but unaccountable .
