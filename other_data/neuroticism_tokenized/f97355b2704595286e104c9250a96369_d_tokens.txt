God , please make 2011 a good year . Amen . 

Need to REALLY start looking for a new job ! 
Everything seems weird today ... 
Sad on a rainy day ... 
Had a car accident ! Rear-ended a < PROPFIRST > of illegal immigrants due to their erratic driving . None of them had a license ! 
It's my half-birthday ! :) 
My car is dead . Battery ? Alternator ? Starter ? Crappy Thanksgiving ! 
I need a new job . 
Ahhh , the Great Blizzard of 2010 ! No work tomorrow ? Crossing my fingers ... 
If your mom is or was your hero , your best friend , or just the best mom ever , if you are blessed to still have your mom or if she is waiting for you in heaven , paste this to your status and let everyone know you are proud of your mom , and that you love her dearly . You can replace a lot of people in life , but you only have one mom 
This weather is too cold , too snowy , too WINTER ! 
Brother's Week ! If you have a brother who has made you laugh , punched you , stuck up for you , drove you crazy , annoyed you to no end , hugged you , watched you succeed , saw you fail , picked you back up , cheered you on , made you strong , and is someone you are very proud to have in your life , tell them . Love you , < PROPFIRST > ( aka Sparky ) . 
Is wondering why my cat Kiwi loves to drink out of the toilet ? Eww ... 
I want to move to Florida . 
\Be happy for this moment . This moment is your life . \"" 
My cat wasn't eating well so the vet prescribed an appetite stimulant . Within one hour , Tulip had a bad reaction with heavy breathing , dilated pupils , < PROPMALE > howling , vomiting and diarrhea . I had to get an antidote !! 
Beware the Ides of March ... 
Wecome back Spring ! Oh how I've missed you ...
