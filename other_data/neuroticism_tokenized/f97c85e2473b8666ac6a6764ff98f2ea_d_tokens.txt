What do you say to a blonde that ask's a rhetorical question about her weight ??? 
I have had incredibly good luck lately . First , I went to Starbucks and the girl in front of me paid for my coffee . Then this couple tried to tip me 100$ for helping them buy an IPad . Then the guy at Pizza Time gave me a large pizza , cheese sticks , and a 2 liter of mountain dew for free . 2011 is gonna be a great year !

Did you ever walk in a room and forget why you walked in ? I think that's how dogs spend their lives . 
A celebrity is a person who works hard all his life to become well known , then wears dark glasses to avoid being recognized . 
Don't worry about the world coming to an end today . It is already tomorrow in Australia . 
< PROPMALE > Andersen is still going to DIE ! 
Never stand between a dog and the hydrant .

Pizza Time is my cure all . 
I have had Pizza Time 3 times this week . Each time i have had the same order , with the same delivery guy . They know my address , first and last name , favorite pizza , and even memorized my debit card # . For the 3rd time this week , they have either ; messed up my order , driven to the wrong end of town , or forgotten my pizza in the store . So , for the 3rd time this week I have had my large double pepperoni pizza for FREE !

Dead Week will be the Death of me .

Dear Dead Week . It has come to my attention that you and I hate each other , so let me make myself perfectly clear . I hate you dead week . Your endless passion to kill trees and brain cells makes me sick ! I am done writing papers for you ! so I hope we can go our separate ways peacefully now . I will never miss the demise of you , my dead week .

I met Zach Galifianakis today at Best Buy , he was drinking coffee with a plastic straw in a Starbucks mug . Had a couple of chunks of bread stuck in his beard .
