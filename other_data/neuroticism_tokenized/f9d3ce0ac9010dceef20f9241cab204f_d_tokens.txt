Dear Peyton Manning , \ 
WTF ? You and the rest of the Colts have to get your act together before you lose the rest of your games and miss the playoffs . It's embarassing . I know you're full of injuries , but 6-5 ? Really ? Honestly , you can do better than that , I mean you arent the Panthers . 
the ncaa is screwing up all the conferences . nebraska going to the big 10 ? tcu going to the big east ? they should just split the thing in two and have west against east . use a playoff brackett and the last 2 teams play for the title . those that lose in the brackett go to bowl games . 
gonna watch < PROPFEMALE > man . what a beautiful movie . 
73% on my ctva test . that sucks , but hopefully just enough to keep me at a c grade . need a good grade on the final and extra credit to pass this horrible class . 
played world cup at soccer practice . so epic !!!! 
Change your facebook profile picture to a cartoon from your childhood and invite your friends to do the same . Until monday ( Dec . 6 ) there should be no human faces on facebook , but an invasion of memories . This is for violence against children .

Black Swan 
Thanks alot for a very dissapointing season , Colts . Thank you even more for a very poor Wild Card game . Along with a few awful plays , and a MORON who runs into the punter , you just flushed postseason hopes down the drain :( Now I have to root for Seattle ... 
Black Swan is filmmaking at its best . If you have not seen it yet , go see it . it will blow ur mind ... literally
