Never question authority . It doesn't know either . 
You spend your whole life believing that you're on the right track , only to discover that you're on the wrong train . 
Just a few minutes ago something really amazing happened to me . I heard a bunch of yelling and crying and was beginning to get very mad and upset . Just as I was about to take action against this \said person\ " I received a text message . Just one of those every day chains that people forward around . It said something that really made me think . "
