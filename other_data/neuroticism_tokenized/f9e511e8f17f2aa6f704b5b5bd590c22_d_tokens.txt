\Moisture is the essence of wetness . And wetness ... is the essence ... of beauty . \ " ~ Zoolander :D "

Two things : \ 
1 ) \Funky Fresh\ " is an oxymoron when you're talking about how feet could smell . \ 
Senior Recital went swimmingly ; I had a lot of fun :)))) Glad I left soon afterwards , I'm not much of a shmoozer and the weather was getting really bleh really fast . Much love to my fellow trio partners , < PROPFEMALE > Ulrich and < PROPMALE > Sychterz , it's awesome playing alongside you guys . :D Sorry I broke your toes , < PROPMALE > :O 
just bought her first pair of high heels , and momma says they make her legs look goood XD \ 
( Now if only she wasn't so terrified of walking in them . ) 
could laugh at herself for how rediculously immature she is acting in such a situation . But perhaps it's not immaturity . \ 
Maybe I just don't know what to say . o_O blehh . 
got her official license !!!! HAPPY TIME ! 
\Take this sinking boat and point it home\ 
got a cumulative $ 2,175 from the scholarship assembly ( which works out amazingly well with my UARTS < PROPMALE > for fall semester ) , plus $175 for < PROPMALE > supplies and two gifts from the RHS < PROPMALE > dep < PROPMALE > ment ? I got $1000 alone from the < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > award ! Holy shizz , I love < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ... :O !!

' s phone service got temporarily cut . Thanks , mom . Thanks for not paying on time and making things a lot harder for me , considering the crap I have to sort out now . 
1 . < PROPFEMALE>'s done ! :) \ 
2 . \I have never been in a [ 5 car ] pileup because of a naked man claiming to be Jesus . \""

' Shake , shake , shake Senora , shake your body line\ 
\ 
Shake , shake , shake Senora , shake it all the time!' 
SO I got lost walking in a < PROPMALE > at a state park today around 7- 8:30 . Luckily , I made it out without having to be labeled a missing person , though at one point I was reciting POL poems to keep calm . On my escapade I met a < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , deer , two turtles , one spazzing when my dog sniffed it , an amazing HUGE white horse , & a beagle playing chicken with my car . Right now all I want is a hug and a human pillow . The end . 
is a superhero . She saves small nephews from speeding minivans . 
\I wish I knew exactly what people think of me . \"" 
Beetlejuice ! Beetlejuice ! Beetlejuice ! \ 
\ 
on abc family :)) 
has no idea what happened to her geometric shape painting , but she can't find it in her house . :| 
\Well it was not your fault but mine\ 
UARTS , why must you make me dish out so much money for a laptop ? I have my own . \ 
Goodbye money ! I'll miss you .. Call me , okay ? :( 
visited Lancaster with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > Balderrama today . Bought glass earrings , watched spitting fountains , met police horses , ate amazing crepes , visited shops , lounged in functional < PROPMALE > across the street from PCAD , and enjoyed a hookah and a Big Yummy Muffin . I give myself two points and a < PROPFIRST > on the back for the day trip idea . :) 
wants to go to Philadelphia for the 4th of July .. something INTERESTING for once . 
Student loans make my head spin :( \ 
p.s. : UARTS registration , you are going DOWN . 
finished registering !! No math ! Screw you , < PROPFIRST > , HAH !!! You can't hurt me anymore !! >:D \ 
... but I can't decide on which Illustration teacher to pick .. 
loves her band geeks very much ? 
Why does applying for student loans feel like making a deal with a devil ? 
is good at making people dizzy on ze Tilt-a-Whirl and spinning teacups at Knoebels . 
Cheer up , baby , it wasn't really always quite so bad . For every bit of venom that came out the antidote was had .. 
is ordering her macbook pro ... \ 
should I partake in this free-ipod-touch-after-rebate thing ? \ 
eeep I dunno ! :/ 
? Springtime for Hitler and Germany , winter for Poland and < PROPFEMALE > ! ? 
wants to run away and join a circus . 
1228 Spruce St. #708 \ 
Hello new casa ? \ 
NOW GIVE ME MY ROOMIE . 
Just woke up to answer the door and I'm SO glad I did . My friggin ' 32gb Ipod Touch came :) Time to BASK IN ITS GLORY ! \ 
And wait for my roommate . \ 
And clear up financial problems . \ 
Today is a college day ...? 
\Everyone should get the opportunity to watch < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > play Robot Unicorn Attack on my iPod 
touched a shark today !! \ 
And I'm convinced that I need to work In the stingray touch exhibit at the adventure aquarium . Stingrays are SO squishy ! :D 
So I'm beginning to sense a pattern here .. Whenever in personal distress , I have a tendency to grab the car and drive until lost . o_o After 30 minutes of driving through corn and cows , I finally busted out the gps . Apparently I was in Bumblefuck , rural Allentown ?? 
My MacBook Pro arrived :) but it's so pretty I'm afraid to touch it for fear of tainting it !! \ 
Do I want to name it < PROPFEMALE > or < PROPFEMALE > ... 
is off to New Joisey ... now ! Go go go ! 
\One of the good things about regrets is sometimes they're still salvageable . \ " \ 
< PROPFEMALE > FUN FACT #67 : I blink at least 60% less when I paint . \ 
I'm an artistic workaholic .. 
< PROPMALE > of Prussia is amazing and smells nice !! \ 
Unfortunately the traffic on the way back was LESS than awesome .. At one point the car was moving so slowly that my gps asked me : \Would you like to switch to pedestrian mode ? \ " hahahahaNO . >:\\ " 
I like when people have their moments when they let their facades temporarily slip , and you get to see this little sliver of what it's really like under their skins . \ 
I'm not really sure if I like when it happens to me , though , because I don't know who I can trust to see my fragments .. 
sees a red door and she wants it painted black .. \ 
Wait , is there anything darker than black ? UGH . >_> 
Hello and welcome to another episode of ' Whose Line Is It Anyway ? ' , the show where everything's made up and the points don't matter ! That's right , the points are just like the irrational and nonsensical statements my mother makes when she's trying to win an argument against me ! \ 
Mom . You're ridicaluss . Please THINK . >:O 
TONNNYY STOP CREEPING ON MY < PROPFEMALE > XD

I still have so much to do and everything feels like it's in fast forward !! Slow down !! \ 
TWO DAYS . SIXTEEN HOURS . GET ME OUT OF HERE . S O S !! 
RIP grandma \ 
Alcon sent mama flowers ! How sweet :) 
I'll miss the familiarity of everything ... the driving for hours on end , singing to every recognizable song ... the adventures and discoveries stemming from getting lost ... the shenanigans and even the occasional monotony . \ 
Leaving for UARTS around 2 pm , I am . \ 
See ya later to my favorite Reading kids . Much love :)

There must be a way to play it here .. somehow .. :( 
Is considering reconsidering this ' try out for music ensemble ( even though it's not your < PROPMALE > ) to play flute ' idea ... asdfghjklfml !! 
doesn't want to deal with sitting in Illustration , freezing her ass off and trying not to fall asleep for 2 hours and 50 minutes , with only 5 of those minutes spent talking to the teacher , and the other 2 hours and 45 minutes spent dying slowly . Not today , I'm too frustrated ..

And take the time for you\ 
I just got lost and slept right through the < PROPFEMALE > \ 
And the world spins madly on

Thank you to the asshole who took the < PROPFEMALE > to remove my clothes from the dryer in the laundry room and lovingly < PROPMALE > them on top of a washing machine instead of waiting a grand total of three minutes for me to take an elevator and get to the laundry room to remove them all myself .

There is a natural sound that wild things make when they're bound\ 
It rumbles in the ground , gurrah , gurrah , we all fall down\ 
But when you hear the sound , ten thousand voices lost and found\ 
Your rumble in the ground , gurrah , gurrah , we all fall down
