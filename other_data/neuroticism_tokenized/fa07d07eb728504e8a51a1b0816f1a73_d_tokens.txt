About to go to < PROPFIRST>'s with < PROPFEMALE > and then drive her to Bradenton to hitch a ride back to Tallahassee :'( Not fun !! 
Sarasota is going apocalyptic . I'm glad I'm getting out of here tonight . :( 
Just drove by the site of the accident . There are 3 different news stations and at least 40 kids standing around crying . I didn't even know any of them but know it's not fair for them to be taken away so abruptly . 
Anyone that makes fun of four children dying in a horrible car accident needs a serious wake up call . For the record : it was the driver's birthday , he was coming home from celebrating and there was no alcohol involved whatsoever . It doesn't matter the circumstances . Tonight three mothers have to go to bed tonight knowing they will never see their children again . How could you ever down-play or make fun of that ? 
Haha there is someone at Pegasus Pointe who has a cat that is sitting on their window sill . Maybe you should be more discreet with your cat that is not allowed . It's super cute though . 
My birthday is in 8 days :) 
There are more changes made to facebook than to gas prices . Annoying . 
I seriously love the UCF shuttles ! 
< PROPMALE > ' em . 
Happy St. < PROPFEMALE>'s Day !!
