< PROPFEMALE > Rigby , picks up the rice in the church were her wedding has been , lives in a dream . Waits at the window , wearing the face she keeps in a jar bt the door , who is it for ? All the lonely people where do they all come from ? All the lonely people , where do they all belong ? 
I kill zombies for a living . They're delicious . 
I'd like to be under the sea , in a an octopus's garden in the shade . He'd let us in , knows where we've been . In an octopus's garden in the shade . 
happeh easter :3 
Green finch and linnet bird , Nightingale , blackbird , How is it you sing ? How can you jubilate , Sitting in cages , Never taking wing ? Outside the sky waits , Beckoning , beckoning , Just beyond the bars . How can you remain , Staring at the rain , Maddened by the stars ? How is it you sing Anything ? How is it you sing ? 
We're just misguided ghosts . 
When I was younger , I saw my Daddy cry . And curse at the wind , he broke his own heart , and I watched as he tried to reassemble it . And my momma swore that she'd never let herself forget . And that was the day that I promised that I would never sing of love , if it does not exist . But darlin ' you are , the only exception ? 
There's one thing that will never give up on you , no matter who you are . That's music . 
Paramore concert September 4th , wihh < PROPFEMALE > :D 
Anu Kung-Fu Gulati , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Bocchino our letters come in two days !!! :D 
I apologize for selfish ignorance . 
Ohkay , for those of you who keep asking me . MY letter or anyone else's did NOT come today . 
Woah , woah , woah . Waffles ? 
Confusing me does no good , when I'm already mad :) 
Well Now I'm told that this is life And pain is just a simple compromise So we can get what we want out of it Would someone care to classify , Of broken hearts and twisted minds So I can find someone to rely on And run To them , to them Full speed ahead Oh you are not , Useless We are just Misguided ghosts ? 
Understanding , leads to dissapointment , dissapointment leads to realization , ad realization leads to confusion , and confusion leads to panic . 
Yeah , I'm weird . What's it to ya ? xD

While being in the library today , and going into the teen room , I was taken aback when I saw a standing figure behind me . I quickly turned to see a < PROPFIRST > Lautner cardboard-cutout staring me in the face .

I could follow you to the beginning , just to relieve the start . Maybe then we'd remember to slow down at all our favorite parts . All I wanted was you . 
Zim : Gir , what have you learned ? Girl : I SAW A SQUIRELL !! :D 
Needs to buy her guitar ... 
Day after day , alone on a hill the man with a foolish grin is keeping prefectly still , but nobody wants to know him . they can see that he is a fool . And he never gives an answer . But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down and the eyes in his head see the world spinning round ... 
All by myself I managed to burn my finger and get electrocuted in the same day , within the same hour . How's that for luck ? 
Watched The Breakfast Club , and < PROPMALE > Python : And the Holy Grail - two extremely random movies with Anu Kung-Fu Gulati ! :D 
Like my status , and I'll write what I like , love , hate , and my first impression was of you :D ! 
Breathe , breathe in the air , don't be afraid to care . Leave but don't leave me , look around and chose your own ground , for long you live and high you fly . \ 
And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry , and all you touch and all you see\ 
is all your life will ever be ... 
< PROPFEMALE > Edwards , here's one . \ 
Trouble I am , But I can't explain why . Pain is remorseful and hope is a rarity . But right now , staring out this window I see the answers . I see everything , I see the inevitable try of hope , the strive to survive and the < PROPFEMALE > of the music . It all seems to fall together , but not enough to make a difference . 
Im the oracle in my chest , let the guitar scream like a fascist . Sweat it out , Shut your mouth free love in the streets but , in the alley and i aint that cheap now , I dont care what you think just as long as its about me the best of us can find happiness in misery ... 
A bottle of mountain dew , and zombieland in bluray . I'm in heaven . 
Independence Day ; 234 years ago the United States won independence from Great Britain , thanks to the Constitution written by < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , along with four other politicians , we became free . Happy Fourth of July . 
I have a theory , on what you call ' justice ' ... 
The sound of that piano , numbs every pain that ever surfaced . 
is on the phone with her sister , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Traino :D !! 
All in all , your just another brick in the wall ... 
Don't stop strumming that guitar , I would fall to pieces . 
Let's run away , forget it all . Give up the fight , put up the white flag . Runaway with me , let's escape . Forgive and Forget . It's our < PROPMALE > . 
Happy Birthday Ringo Starrr !!!! :D And Bilsy < PROPFIRST > !!! 
Finally beat GTA4 after 38 hours . :D 
Uh , like my status and I'll confess something to you ? 
Thank you Anu Kung-Fu Gulati and < PROPFEMALE > Bocchino :D 
My day was made , I actually got a 6 on FCAT Writes , a 6 ! :D W00T ! W00T ! 
Anu Kung-Fu Gulati : Well , she's not bleeding on the ballroom floor \ 
Just for the attention . \ 
Cause that's just ridiculously on . \ 
Well , she sure is gonna get it \ 
Here's the setting \ 
Fashion magazines line the walls now\ 
The walls line the bullet holes\ 
Me : Have some composure \ 
Where is your posture ? \ 
Oh , no , no\ 
You're pulling the trigger \ 
Pulling the trigger \ 
All wrong 
Along with the people inside\ 
What a wonderful caricature of intimacy\ 
Inside , what a wonderful caricature of intimacy\ 
There are no raindrops on roses and girls in white dresses . \ 
It's sleeping with roaches and taking best guesses \ 
At the shade of the sheets and before all the stains\ 
And a few more of your least favorite things . 
When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse out of the corner of my eye I turned to look but it was gone I cannot put my finger on it now , the child is grown the dream is gone\ 
I have become comfortably numb ... 
The Twilight Zone marathon of SyFy :D !! 
I'm not going to act ignorant for your own selfish being , I have a soul . 
You think me blind , what a fool you are . 
So tell me when you hear my heart stop , You’re the only who knows . Tell me when you hear my silence . There’s a possibility I wouldn’t know . Tell me when my sigh is over . You’re the reason why I’m close , tell me if you hear me falling There's a possibility It wouldn’t show ... 
I'm just as lost as you , don't think your alone . 
Do you know what it's like to feel so in the dark ? To dream about a life where you're the shining < PROPFEMALE > ? Even though it seems , like it's too far away I have to believe in myself . It's the only way\ 
This is real , this is me . 
I can't help it , I'm an elf at heart ... 
I've never showed how much you mean to me , and I think thats starting to take affect . 
I'm gonna fall , deeper below the surface . To a never ending world , where everything is wrong , but were all too blind to ever notice ... 
is overjoyed !! :DD 
Don't mind me , I'm just admiring your roses ... 
Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way . Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town Waiting for someone or something to show you the way . Tired of lying in the sunshine . Staying home to watch the rain . And you are young and life is long ... 
There's someone in my head but it's not me . And if the cloud bursts , thunder in your ear . You shout and no one seems to hear . And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes . I'll see you on the dark side of the moon ... \ 
\I can't think of anything to say except ... I think it's marvelous ! HaHaHa ! \"" 
Breathe , breathe in the air . Don't be afraid to care . Leave but don't leave me . Look around and choose your own ground . \ 
Long you live and high you fly . And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry . And all you touch and all you see . Is all your life will ever be ... 
I already told you but , Happy Birthday Joy Lopez !! :DD 
Anu Kung-Fu Gulati : WELL THAT SUCKS . xDD 
Let me fly because keeping me trapped won't do you any good . 
Is home from Disney World . (: 
You know you're unlucky when you order Chinese takeout and not only do they mess your order up , but your fortune cookie , doesn't even have a fortune ... 
Mom : < PROPFEMALE > dis you eat your salad ? \ 
< PROPFEMALE > : yeah , see . \ 
Me : just because you turn your jowl upside down doesn't mean you ate your salad ... \ 
< PROPFEMALE > : ( laughs ) yeah it does . \ 
Mom : eat your salad . 
Give me envy , give me malice , give me your attention\ 
Give me envy , give me malice , baby give me a break\ 
When I say shotgun , you say wedding\ 
Shotgun , wedding , shotgun , wedding\ 
She didn't choose this role\ 
But she'll play it and make it sincere\ 
So you cry , you cry\ 
Give me a break 
And the music makes my heart flutter , and my mind soar higher than before . Pushing me towards the light , cradling my every precious memory in it's floating notes . The bad flying out , and a rejoice in song completes it . 
Hypocrisy is the most common value of human society . So , how can you sit there and tell me that's not true , but when someone else comes into your life it is . Does being two-faced satisfy the most hypocrite humans of us all ? It seems so . 
And that song , reminds me of why I fell in love with music . 
If I fell in love with you \ 
could you promise to be true \ 
And help me understand \ 
' Cause I've been in love before \ 
And I've found that love is more \ 
That just holding hands \ 
If I give my heart to you \ 
I must be sure from the very start \ 
that you would love me more than her ... 
Can I forget , just for a little while ? 
I hope it's not me you assumed to be the bad guy , because if it is , you've got a liar on your hands ... 
Words are flowing out\ 
Like endless rain into a paper cup\ 
They slither while they pass\ 
They slip away across the universe\ 
Pools of sorrow waves of joy\ 
Are drifting through my open mind\ 
Possessing and caressing me\ 
Jai Guru Deva , om\ 
Nothing's gonna change my world ... 
I've come to believe the fact that we only live once . The time spent here , as described by many people may be long or short depending on the way you look at it . We've all have come or are going to realize this . So how come the people that do , can't live the way their mind does ? Have the guts to do what they always imagined , and walk the way they wanted to ? 
Well do you or don't you want me to love you ? I'm coming down fast but I'm < PROPMALE > above you ! Tell me , tell me , tell me ! Baby tell me the answer . Well you may be a lover but you ain't no dancer .. Look out ! Helter Skelter ! 
Does anyone have any idea as to what Mrs. Goldman's ( French ) Homework is ? All I got was , \There's gonna be a dictation - wait never mind so -\" -bing bing- and everyone left ... " 
and it's been in my head all day . 
is going to be a blondie again . 
and I'll swim the ocean for you . 
I get by with a little help from my friends ... 
And I love you , yeah , yeah , yeah . 
Happy Birthday < PROPFEMALE > Schissler and < PROPFEMALE > Policastro !! :D 
Zombieland <3 ; a great ending to a crappy day . 
I love when < PROPFEMALE > Grossman comes over , she steals my macaroni and insults my salsa . xD 
And it will never be enough , until you start to notice . 
Maybe it's because you used to be my everyday . The one person who I smiled with , laughed with , walked with , who took my breath away . Now here we are , so close and so far at the same time . 
Castles Made of Sand - Jimi Hendrix (: 
If you could've caught my face at that moment , you would have smiled . 
I love you ! I love you ! I love you ! That's all I wanted to say . Until I find a way , I will say the words that I know you will understand ... 
Oh that boy , he's somethin ' . (: 
Boredom will make you choke , it's the only time the mind is allowed to wander , and we all know that never ends well ... 
I'm as happy as my brother when he drinks chocolate milk , and a spongebob marathon is on TV ... 
And he's what I've dreamed of from the start , the one I danced with in my sleep , the one who held me when i weeped . Oh , how he's what I've dreamed of ... 
Has a feeling for the rest of freshman year she will only get seven hours of sleep a night ... 
My life isn't a movie , a script written for me . I don't walk a certain way because you want me too . I don't laugh on cue , I'm not living for you . Everything I do , is who I am , and if you can't handle that , well that's your problem ... 
Totally freaked out when I walked up to < PROPFEMALE > Maverick Flowers , listening to my iPod and she knew I was listening to Jimi Hendrix O.o As Cohen would say , \Coincidence ? I think not . \ " (: " 
If you took a few moments to take a look into my eyes you'd see a lot more than a trapped soul ... 
PARAMORE CONCERT TONIGHT WITH < PROPFEMALE > :D !! 
Maybe I know somewhere deep in my soul that love never lasts . And we've got to find other ways to make it alone or keep a straight face . And I've always lived like this , keeping a comfortable , distance . And up until now I swore to myself that I'm content with loneliness , ' cause none of it was ever worth the risk . \ 
But darlin ' you are the only exception ... 
Covered in sweat , confetti in my hair and my voice no longer available . Talk about best concert ever . 
It's quite sad that I have accustomed myself to nightmares , atleast I'm not afraid anymore ... 
Talk about drowning in your own misery . 
Strike up the band ! Whoa-oh , the conductor is beckoning come congregation , let's sing it like you mean it , No . Don't you get it , don't you get it ? Now don't you move . \ 
Just stay where I can see you , douse the lights ! We sure are in for a show tonight ... 
I'm the new cancer , never looked better , you can't stand it . Because you say so under your breath . You're reading lips \When did she get all confident ? \"" 
I've got more wit , a better kiss , a hotter touch , a better love than any girl you'll ever meet , sweetie you had me . Boy I was it , look past the sweat , a better love deserving of exchanging body heat in the passenger seat ? No , no , no , you know it will always just be me . Let's get these teen hearts beating , faster , faster . So testosterone boys and harlequin girls , will you dance to this beat , and hold a lover close ? 
I'll find solace in the deepest of my dreams ... 
I'm lost in a puddle of worry . 
My favorite dream became my worst nightmare when I understood it was a harsh portrayal of my reality ... 
I just can't tell you how much I love geometry . 
I just realized a lot of my friends call me cupcake , why is this ? 
I can't even laugh . 
I love going to the dermatologist for a normal check up , and they always find something new . And decide to remove it then an there . I had two biopsies my sister , nothing . This isn't the first time either . 
What's the point ? If it's not gonna happen , well I'm walking away . Let the pieces fall were they may . 
Where does beautiful come from ? Why do my friends call me cupcake ? Why is the world turning so slowly ? Why do we grow up so fast ? Can we not be oblivious forever ? .. 
Busy my mind ; Like my status and I'll tell you something . 
How about we act like this never happened ? 
Needs to play Ocarina of Time right now . 
Me : I'm oddly happy today , it's weird . It's like a good day . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > Swartout : What ? It's a bad day . \ 
Me : Really , thats weird ... Maybe I'm happy when everyone else is miserable ? \ 
Ally Kraska : Thats horrible ! You derive happiness from the misery of others ! 
That's a bunch of HOOLPA . HOOPLAA !!!! HOOPLAA !!!! 
I love headaches that last continous , and uncountable hours . 
for all my friends , family and their loved ones September is cancer month . In memory of every cancer patient , family member and friend that lost their battle with cancer and in honor of those who continue to conquer it ! Put this up for 1 hour if you love someone who ... has or had cancer . Many won't copy and paste I did , will you ? 
get me out of here .

Ally : Like a kabob ! And he can share you with all his friends ! \ 
Me : Yes , that's how I want to go . Shared by two narwhalls . \

Getting a haircut . \

I miss my long hair ); 
So I'm on the couch with my brother , and I say , \Mikey want to watch Toy Story ? \ " and he does his ' wow ' face and continues to throw the French fries everywhere . I get up turn on the movie and I come back and he's drinking up all my sweet tea from McDonald's . I swear he drank it all . " 
Is tomorrow really an even day ? 
leaseput this on your status if you know someone ( or are related to someone)who has been eaten by dragons . My wish for 2011 is that people will understand that being eaten by dragons is not something to be ashamed of . Dragons are nearly unstoppable and are truly terrifying . 93% won't copy and paste this ... they have already been eaten ... by dragons . 
Oh my god , I had the most amazing time last night , I dreamt I saw you again . \ 
That's when the flashbacks started to begin .. \ 
They started slow , But they picked up fast , \ 
So I got off my ass , and I ran away .. <3 
That was the first time I ever watched Glee , ever . \ 
Let me tell you , how amazing it was . \ 
Sooo , Amazing . <3 
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl , year after year . Running over the same old ground . What have we found ? The same old fears . \

I'm letting you change me , and that's a big mistake . \ 
And it's about to end . 
' I am bleeding Banana Blood ' - the Banana < PROPMALE > . 
Would you like this status , for the pure joy of liking at status ? 
Nothing's gonna change my world . Images of broken light , which dance before me like a million eyes . That call me on and on , across the universe . Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box , they tumble blindly as they make their way , \ 
across the universe ... 
All of me is sad-sad-sad . \ 
All of me is mad-mad-mad . \ 
Hope that's not bad-bad-bad . 
Insomnia to the fullest . 
Yes , you could call me insane . Seems quite accurate if you ask me . 
It's these substandard motels on the corner of 4th and Fremont Street . Appealing only because they are just that un-appealing , any practiced catholic would cross themselves upon entering . The rooms have a hint of asbestos and maybe just a dash of formaldehyde , and the habit of decomposing right before your very eyes . \ 
Along with the people inside . What a wonderful caricature of intimacy .... 
I'm the new cancer , never looked better , and you can't stand it , because you say so under your breath . Your reading lips \When did she get all confident ? \"" 
Let me take you down , cos I'm going to strawberry fields ... \ 
Nothing is real .

\Why don't you make like a tree 
Syfy tricked me , I totally thought Tommyknockers was four hours long . \ 
Don't I feel stupid ... 
It will never just stop :/ 
CHAT ME ? \

If anyone wants to do the several pages of French homework I was assigned , that would be awesome . Jussayin ' . ;D 
Take my hand , show me the way , we are the children that fell from grace . Take my hand , show me the way , we are the children who can’t be saved ... 
w00t , Chicago is finally on my iPod ^-^ ;; 
Just keep playing the music , and I'll be just fine . 
Broward's Children Center with < PROPFEMALE > tomorrow , for a Halloween Celebration with my favorite kids (: 
The dreams are so much taller , and I feel so much smaller . 
Please make this your status if someone you knew was killed by Lord Voldemort or any of his followers . As everybody knows , being killed by a killing curse , having your soul sucked out by a dementor , or getting petrified by a basilisk is a truly tragic fate for anyone ; muggle or wizard . 93% of people won't copy and paste this , for they have already been killed . 
Two hours of French , and two hours of Geometry just won't do . 
All goldfish are Mexican ; proves consensus .

So no internet and i really need to talk to a certain someone . FML . 
Nothing like having a dream about trolls going through your mail and playing Ding < PROPFIRST > Ditch on your street . 
I'm turning off . Hope drained to zero , love to negative ten . Nothing to hold onto , oh how I've been let down too many times . Sometimes it's your fault and mostly it's mine . 
is getting six months of hardware , and two years of braces with props , and rubberbands , yay for me right ? HAHAHAHA NO . 
As if the silly love songs on the radio weren't already torturing me enough .. 
LIES LIES LIES . They roll right off your tounge . 
< PROPFEMALE > Maverick McKeown , I thought you should know - and be really pleased to know - that we regularly watch < PROPMALE > Horror in my house atleast three times a week . 
Maybe , just maybe , I'll be able to fit twenty minutes of Black Ops into my day . 
Like this status for a song you remind me of . 
Album of the Week ;\ 
Pretty . Odd . by Panic ! At The Disco . 
I'll take a quiet life , a handshake of carbon monoxide with no alarms and no surprises . <3 Radiohead . 
Everybody sing like it’s the last song you will ever sing\ 
Tell me , tell me , do you feel the pressure now ? \ 
Everybody live like it’s the last day you will ever see\ 
We were born for this .

Now some people tell me that old cat's are awkward , but when my iTunes switched from Nevershoutnever's ' I love you 5 ' to ' Comfortably Numb ' by Pink < PROPMALE > my whole definition of awkward has been questioned . 
Been sick since wednesday , and candlelight is around the corner T.T 
Cellophane . Ms. Cellophane shoulda been my name , Ms. Cellophane , ' cause you can look right through me , walk right by me and never know I'm there . 
Cleaned the house while rehearsing Disney Candlelight Music , I feel accomplished . 
You look so tired-unhappy .

I'll find repose in new ways , though I haven't slept in two days . ' Cause cold nostalgia chills me to the bone . 
Along with the people inside . What a wonderful caricature of intimacy . Inside , what a wonderful caricature of intimacy . 
Advil Cold&Flu is crap compared to the wonders of DayQuil Cold&Flu ; then again DayQuil is three times as expensive .

Are you worth your weight in gold ? \ 
' Cause you're behind my eyelids when I'm all alone \ 
Hey , stranger , I want you to catch me like a cold \ 
You and I both got the guns \ 
When you shoot I think I'm done 
I'm a fly that's trapped in a web \ 
But I'm thinking that , my spiders dead \ 
Lonely , lonely little life \ 
I could kid myself in thinking that I'm fine 
I know it's mad , but If I go to hell would you come with me or just leave ? I know it's mad , but if the world were ending would you kiss me or just leave me ? 
When July became December \ 
Their affection fought the cold \ 
But they couldn't quite remember what inspired them to go \ 
And it was beautifully depressing \ 
Like a streetcar named < PROPFEMALE > \ 
They were fighting for their love and started growing tired 
but who could love me , I am out of my mind . 
Tbh ? 
Thanks for all the birthday wishes , lovelies . ?
