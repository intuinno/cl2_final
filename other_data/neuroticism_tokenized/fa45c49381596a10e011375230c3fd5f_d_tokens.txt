At last , with a little shaking of his arm , and thrice his head waving up and down , he raises a sigh so piteous and profound that it does seem to shatter all his bulk and end his being . 
We cross our bridges when we come to them and burn them behind us , with nothing to show for our progress except a memory of the smell of smoke , and a presumption that once our eyes watered . -R&GAD 
I smell like smoke from the Puente bonfire and I can't feel my left < PROPFEMALE > toe but playing psychiatrist and eating stuff off hangers all night was awesome !!! 
Just got back from the Asking < PROPFEMALE > concert at Chain and if his < PROPFEMALE > toe wasn't broken before , it is now XD
