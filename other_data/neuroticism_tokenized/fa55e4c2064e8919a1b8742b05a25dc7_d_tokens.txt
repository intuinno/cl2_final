solipsism : the philosophical idea that one's own mind is all that exists . Solipsism is an epistemological or ontological position that knowledge of anything outside the mind is unjustified . The external world and other minds cannot be known and might not exist . In the history of philosophy , solipsism has served as a skeptical hypothesis .

PLEASE put this on your status if you know someone ( or are related to someone ) who has been eaten by dragons . Dragons are nearly unstoppable and , in case you didn't know , they can also breathe fire . 93% of people won't copy and paste this , because they have already been eaten by dragons . 6% of people are sitting in the shower armed with fire extinguishers and the remaining 1% are awesome and will re-post .
