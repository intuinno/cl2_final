Haha ! Hahahahahaha ! Fake tans . XD Look at all the orange people !

My pocket smells like a fireplace . =] 
* Looks at computer for a long time , then at the TV * \What in the bawls am I watching ?! \"" 
Okay so : for some entertainment I decided to drink tea from a ketchup thing ... no ketchup in it . XD 
Hold back your fears you're more than home . Could it be that the tears no longer sad but true . Break the moment into something more than gold . And I realize it now , it was never meant to hold . 
I can't take you seriously with that silly profile cartoon . Pedophiles or child abuse protesters : either way , I can't help but laugh . 
It's not music . It's free therapy . 
It's too bad we never talk anymore . But on the other hand ... Life is better with you gone . 
A person has 1000 wishes . A Soldier only has one , to come home safe . I know 97% of you wont post this as your status , but the 3% that do are my friends . In honor of someone that died or is fighting for your freedom please post 
Should i be nervous or exited ? 
I don't even know why I'm on the internet , I'm to tired to even eat anything . 
Being a celebrity isn't a job . These days , you can't even be a cashier with a criminal record . 
What an interestingly random time to ponder how you're doing . 
Man-o-man , does my stomach feel icky . Damn you < PROPFEMALE > L . LLanos and < PROPFIRST > Bachant for getting me feel so gross on the insides . 
loo < PROPFIRST > doo . 
Faster then redheaded step children , quiet as any ninja , drunk as any pirate and cooler than < PROPFIRST > the Ripper : THE CREEPERS ! 
What have I got myself into this time ? 
I swear , food is out to get me . 
Only in Alaska will you find a hatchet next to the Cheerios . 
Yeah , I know nobody knows where it comes and where it goes . I know it's everybody's sin . You got to lose to know how to win . 
How many people can actually claim that they've broken a whoopy cushion by sitting on it ? 
Ever get that sudden \I-wanna-drop-kick-a-pickle-across-the-empire-state-building-while whistling-the-'Benny Hill freak out speed'-theme-song-because-I-can\ " feeling ? " 
Irony : It bites me in the ass every day of my life . 
I need a change . Something exiting ... Or at least something worth a memory . 
I've decided to widen my interest in the human skeleton . I know all the < PROPMALE > ones , but now I'm working on the hands and feet and soon every plate in the cranium . My 2011 goal : memorize more than half . =] 
I used to howl at the < PROPFEMALE > , yeah I've been known to roam . Then I caught her trail one day , followed this girl home . I ain't the same ... She knows how to put my chain . 
Okay , so I finally got the bright idea to go to youtube and look up this \What what ? \ " Song that < PROPFIRST > Hendricks < PROPMALE > Pruitt and < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > are always singing . I officially burned my retinas and almost puked chocolate milk all over . Thanks a lot . You guys are nasty . XD "

Lemons . 
I know it's cold outside , but if I wanna wear shorts and sandals and clean my room to The Beach Boys ... I will . I'm pickin ' up good vibrations ... =] 
I almost told you that I loved you . Thank god I didn't ' cause it would've been a lie . I say the damnedest things when you're on top of me . I almost told you that I loved you . <-- My newest favorite . =] 
Step two : Carpals . 
I bet this would go a lot faster if I could just pull up my big girl panties and call . 
What do you think my last words would be ? 
Promises mean everything when you're little and the world's so big . I just don't understand how you can smile with all those tears in your eyes . Tell me everything is wonderful now . Please don't tell me everything is wonderful now . 
Let's start a debate . Cereal is best eaten cold in the late afternoon . Agree/disagree ? 
Just took out all those braids that were in my hair . I have an epic poodle ponytial . XD 
A \smart ass\ " is someone who can sit on an ice cream cone and tell you what flavor it is . " 
This is when you'd expect me to come up with a witty comment . I'll show YOU a witty comment .

Yo everybody , thanks for the \happy birthday\ " s and stuff ! " 
If I seem to be ignoring you I just wanted to say that your assumptions are right . Leave me be for a little while . 
Momma made me good noodles . I'm happy now . =] 
Just got CD two of three from my dad . =] 1 . ) EXITED TO GET MAIL ! 2 . ) PM5K : It speaks for itself . I love it . 
Guess who got her homework done ! Me ! 
Somewhere on the other side of nowhere . That's where were going and you'll know when we get there . Somewhere on the other side of nowhere , that's where we're going now . 
LAME . 
Love comes in all flavors and they are all pretty damn delicious . 
Then I realized that the only thing keeping the plate balanced was the tatertots I was eating . 
When you give me k-kisses . ( That's money , < PROPFEMALE > ) When I'm your lover and your mistress . ( That's money , < PROPFEMALE > ) When you touch me it's so delicious . ( That's money , < PROPFEMALE > ) Baby , when you tear me to pieces . ( That's money , < PROPFEMALE > )\ 
That's M O N E Y , so sexy , I 
Yeah baby , who's that long , dark haired goddess in a big \Taz\ " Tee shirt ? Me . =] Now I'm going to bed . " 
Let's see how creative my Facebook friends are .... Leave me a 1-word comment that best describes me using the THIRD letter of YOUR FIRST name .... It can only be 1 word .... Then copy and paste this to your wall so I can leave a word about you .... Don't just post a word & not copy .. That's no fun .... 
I spent most my day in a gorilla suit and this is what I got from it : Dancing with people is fun when they don't know who the hell you are ! 
The name is Pickles . Got it ? Good . 
Got my heels after all . The little reddish pair are smaller and easier to walk in , but the ice-cream shop ones give me an extra six inches . I'm as tall as Dad in them . Thanks for the late birthday gifts , Momma . =] 
Maybe I should just take pictures of myself rather than let everybody else take them , because seriously , in some of these I just wanna rip my face off . XD 
Yay ! Now we can enjoy jerky together like REAL cannibals . \ 
* CARNIVORES ! 
Fill in the blank : \I could really use a ______ right about now . \"" 
Salt increases water density , but Chocolate powder makes milk nearly impenetrable . 
Oh joy ... another seemingly pointless day . Woke up , went to school , had a few laughs , went home , cleaned ( most of ) the kitchen ( hope I don't get in trouble for skipping the dishes . ) Waiting for a call that most likely isn't coming . Wishing for an e-mail from someone that probably isn't home ... * sigh * Another day . 
Inspector Gadget * < PROPFIRST > na-na-na NAT NA ! * 
My I-tunes top 3 : ALTERNATIVE . ROCK . METAL . Yours ? 
Yeah , that's right . Roll with them punches ! 
What a yummy blue cereal ... I like frosted mini wheats . =] 
BORED . The snow looks fun , but it's not fun when you're out there by yourself . Then it's just cold and quiet . 
It takes an actress to be pretty in pictures , but it takes a WOMAN to be pretty in real life . Take that , models and media , take that . 
You and I wake up in a psychiatric < PROPMALE > together . Using only four words , what would you say to me ? Note : If you comment , you must copy and paste this to your status , so I may comment on yours as well . Be a good sport and play along ! Four words is harder than you think ! :D 
OKAY , OKAY TAKE IT ! TAKE THE WEINER , JUST GET OUTTA MY CROTCH ! 
HOLY SCHIST ! MY STATUS JUST CHANGED !! 
The Gettysburg Address is kickin ' my < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > . 
Oy . Why do people need sleep in the first place ? I never wanna go to sleep ... but when I get up in the morning I would give my left imaginary nut to stay in bed . 
< PROPFEMALE > Lauth : \It's Chocolate ! \ " \ 
We're having pizza tonight ... and I want absolutely nothing to do with it . 
< PROPFEMALE > ! 
Hmm ... I don't know where this bruise came from ... 
Zombies are cooler than Vampires , werewolves , Big foot , and crazy frog all put together . 
A friend in need's a friend indeed , a friend who'll tease is better . Our thoughts compress which makes us blessed and makes for < PROPFEMALE > weather . 
It's gonna be a long week ... Dammit . 
My shoe's untied ... I think I should tie it . If I don't I might trip over it ... we all know how awesome THAT looks . 
RIDDICK ! =D <3 !!! 
I robbed a crackhead because that bitch stole my taco . 
For natural male enhancement : Put your hand in a bag of imported Bananas . =] 
Wanna be a rebel ... don't have the bawls to get into trouble . XD Well ... At least Mom and Dad don't have anything to worry about . 
SOMEBODY . Entertain me . Or at least step on my fingers so I can entertain myself . 
Getting better ! Yay ! Felt like I was dying for a while there . XD 
Yes , it is fudgy and delicious . No , I'm just kidding , it was strawberry . XD 
Random piece of conversation with myself using movie lines :\ 
\So 
You ... You make my butt itch . >.> 
Then I realized ... things get awkward when you're involuntarily pelvic thrusting and nobody's watching . 
The hills are not alive with the sound of music . In fact , the hills are alive with the sound of godzilla stepping on your head . Enjoy .
