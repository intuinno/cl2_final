the combination of a pyromaniac , a lighter , and a full can of tag has an interesting outcome 
oh my god . so i decided to burn this reeeaally ugly shoe in the upstairs bathroom . unluckily for me i overlooked the smoke detector that was 10 feet away . but with the help of my also pyro brother , my parents believed that the smoke detector only went off cuz the battery was dying ... funny how they failed to notice i smell like smoke

The lead singer of breaking < PROPMALE > makes the funniest facial expressions when he sings

Well they encourage your complete cooperation , Send you roses when they think you need to smile . I can't control myself because I don't know how , And they love me for it honestly , I'll be here for a while . \ 
So give them blood , blood , gallons of the stuff ! Give them all that they can drink and it will never be enough . So give them blood , blood , blood . Grab a glass because there's going to be a flood ! 
my eye doctor thinks i'm asian lol 
facebook mobile is being stupid .... or maybe its my gay cell ... 
\Cause we are all a bunch of animals That never paid attention in school . So tell me all about your problems ; I was killing before killing was cool . \""

What sucks about playing two versions of the game is that if you lose one , you lose both .. 
My parents made a terrible mistake naming me ; my name means sweet and kind ... 
According to my mother ; theres no difference between alternative rock and death metal .... 
Facebook mobile is so stupid sometimes ... 
I can never finish writing any of my stories .. 
You know you're addicted to Facebook when you spend your time off Facebook thinking about what your next post should say .. 
texting , talking on facebook , and cleaning the dishes at the same time .. i got skillz 
Drove the Mustang the other day .... I was fine until i parked directly on the line instead of on the space .. 
I was really hoping this summer wouldn't be < PROPFEMALE > ...

I hate sleeping in .. 
resident evil outbreak is actually very boring .. 
what would a civilized zombie look like ?.. 
everything i wrote on my hand in sharpie yesterday has ended up on my face while i was asleep .. 
Summer : a screwed up way of seeing how boring your life can be without school ..

New number is 3607100914 
of all the times the power could go out , why does it have to be when im babysitting ?

Drank like 6 vaults and now im hyper at like 3 in the morning with nothing to do but light stuff on fire .. 
Im losing my paleness .. that blows i hate getting tan 
LOST THE GAME 
Epic fail !!! i turned down the wrong road walking from the main gate and now idk where i am lol 
Not a shred of evidence exists to prove that life is serious 
I might be in a lot of trouble for something so if i dont reply to your text or if i dont answer my phone its cuz i got it taken away for god knows how long ... 
For some reason my dad has not yet grounded me or taken away my phone ... 
I want to change my name < PROPFEMALE > bad 
Text me 
i accidentally twisted my words around and called the xbox a sexbox , in front of my dad . i have the feeling im never going to be able to forget about that cuz now everyone in my family is laughing at me .. 
so < PROPFIRST > and i had this debate over which game to buy from game stop because i really wanted bioshock 2 and he wanted god of war 3 , but it turned out that we actually had enough money for both ... 
Little sisters are < PROPFEMALE > annoying 
Somehow one of my dogs managed to sleep on my face without waking me up 
1 : detweiler , 2 : story , 3 : galbraith , 4 : jacobson , 5 : rarig , 6 : wright 
I just burned the top of my ear with my hair straightener . fml

My dog is so annoying 
Good news the computer is fixed . Bad news i have to share it with < PROPFIRST >

Riot by three days grace . awesome song 
Im considering lighting a bible on fire . hmm that should be entertaining 
HOUSE !!! 
Ever get so pissed off that you want to just scream at the top of your lungs and punch through a wall ... or a person ?

Put this in your status . Don't erase your mistakes ! 
I don't want to change the world , I just want to leave it colder 
I hate when my parents are arguing with eachother and i have the urge to laugh at what one of them says 
So here we are ,? fighting and trying to hide the scars 
I feel so much better now that you're gone forever . I tell myself that I don't miss you at all . I'm not lying , denying that i feel so much better , now that you're gone forever . \ 
Now things are coming clear , that I don't need you here . And in this world around me , I'm glad you disappeared . 
Well it looks like I'm moving to Seattle everyone , so I may never see any of you again depending on if I move before break or not . But yeah ... goodbye 
Staring at the carnage , praying that the sun would never rise . 
I'm standing on the rooftop , ready to fall

put this on your status if you know someone ( or are related to someone ) who has been eaten by dragons . Dragons are nearly unstoppable and , in case you didn't know , they can also breathe fire . 93% of people won't copy and paste this , because they have already been eaten by dragons . 6% of people are sitting in the shower armed with fire extinguishers and the remaining 1% are awesome and will repost .

As an Atheist , I find it funny that xmas is my second favorite holiday 
hahaha almost everything i got had something to do with Nightmare Before Christmas or Avenged Sevenfold

I pulled a muscle in my back ...... Ouch 
Sometimes I don't know why we'd rather live than die , we look up towards the sky for answer to our lives . We may get some solutions , but most just pass us by . Don't want your absolution , cause i can't make it right -Bat Country , A7X 
Its funny how people are saying that this new year is going to be a fresh start or whatever when really the only thing thats changing is time 
Health was entertaining as always 
Seriously . Why are there so many girls freaking out about that pretty little liars show ? I'm lost here .. 
One day , she's going to die a sad , miserable , brutal , agonizing death ; and when that happens there will be a huge dance party on her grave that will last for years , without ever stopping . :) 
I can't believe Ms Rarig actually let me set that air car on fire in class

I can feel the animal inside\ 
My resolve is weakening\ 
Pounding at the doors of my mind\ 
It's nearly overpowering\ 
I cannot begin to describe\ 
The hunger that I feel again\ 
Run if you intend to survive\ 
For the beast is coming to life\ 
Taking form in the glimmer in this tainted moonlight\ 
Death approaches on this night \ 
( Disturbed is just awesome ) 
Allisya is going to kill me once she finds out about my eyebrow piercing lol

Its funny how religious people get so mad when you dis anything remotely religious 
I'm already dead , I'll rise to fall again

Just because you hit someone and they die doesn't mean you killed them 
You know it's going to be a horrible day when you can't find your hair straightener 
Okay potheads , here's a fact : It would take 800 marijuana joints to kill you ; but the cause of death would only be carbon monoxide poisoning , not weed itself 
Shelter me from this again\ 
Dedicated to the end\ 
Help me break my conscience in\ 
To free us from our innocence\ 
- Breaking < PROPMALE > is amazing- 
I literally almost died today in a car crash .... but i did pass out 
one of the many negative traits of dogs is that they like to bark at EVERY noise they hear , and so with every firework that goes off , i have to hear two dogs acting like the world is about to end if they don't bark as loud as they possibly can ... fun . 
Great ... my scraped arm got infected 
< PROPFEMALE > , your last name is mine now lol 
Please forgive me\ 
For laughing when you fall\ 
I'm so sorry\ 
But I never cared at all\ 
-5FDP 
Cause I'm losing my sight , losing my mind \ 
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine \ 
Nothing's alright , nothing is fine \ 
I'm running and I'm crying \ 
I never realized I was spread too thin \ 
Till it was too late and I was empty within 
We will disappear at night with blood on the concrete 
Is it bad that i didn't know the cold war was between < PROPFEMALE > and Russia ? 
I swear it's like i'm the only person who DOESN'T like anime 
How can I believe when this cloud hangs over me\ 
You're the part of me that I don't wanna see\ 
-Breaking < PROPMALE > 
I'd die to win\ 
Cause I'm born to lose 
you're right\ 
I can never lie\ 
let me go\ 
try to find a home\ 
I can't wait\ 
try to stay awake\ 
dead inside\ 
bothered by the lie\ 
- Breaking < PROPMALE > 
YESSS IT'SSSS RAIIININNNG 
I don't mind , \ 
forget it\ 
there's nothing to lose\ 
but my mind and all the things I wanted 
wth facebook . the IM thing absolutely sucks now 
i understand < PROPMALE > potter is over or whatever , but whats with everybody obsessing over it ? 
< PROPFEMALE > Hockett . wowww way to also rape my notifications . 
< PROPFEMALE > Hockett and < PROPFIRST > Stauner . in the last twenty minutes , ive gotten over 50 notifications cuz of you guys . i do believe ive been raped beyond comprehension . 
My brother is a disappointment . He's watching anime 
Well isn't that great ... I could just kill someone right now . 
I wish I didn't have brown eyes 
I hate to say it but it has to be said ;\ 
You look so fragile as I fuck with your head\ 
-Papa Roach 
Our scars remind us \ 
That the past is real 
Forever hold this heart that I will give to you\ 
Forever I will live for you 
Everyone is < PROPFEMALE > excited over movies like transformers 3 and < PROPMALE > potter whatever number it is , but i personally can't wait to see Final Destination 5 
apparently I can't have fast internet because the cables will break or something , so the internet speed was cut down to less than half .. that's beyond ridiculous 
this is the BEST summer weather i have ever seen ! yeahhh thunderrr ! 
The death punch sound\ 
Is our claim to fame 
Such a sorry end\ 
And I don't know why\ 
So I joke and smile
