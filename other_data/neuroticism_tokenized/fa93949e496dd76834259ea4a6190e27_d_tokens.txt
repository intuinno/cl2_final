cant wait to get hypnotized tonight .... and is anyone else tired of < PROPFEMALE > minaj's fake accent ? i refuse to believe shes actually british . 
the ONE THING i cant stand is gettin ignored . one of the few ways to get under my skin and get disowned .

i wonder if ANYONE can correctly fill in the blank . i highly doubt it . 
people get better when they start to\ 
understand that they are valuable . and you're not valuable beacuse you\ 
got a whole lot of money , or because somebody thinks you're sexy , but you're\ 
valuable because you've been created by God . and God makes you valuable 
i appreciate that Brit'Nay < PROPMALE > appreciates my proper semicolon use . such a small detail , yet sooo important 
when all you need is to met halfway , but nobody tries .... don't be surprised . 
is it bad that I automatically think babies with yankees hats are less cute ? 
just saw khloe kardashian for the first time while skimming thru ok magazine ( I was incredibly bored ) . she looks like a boxer . that's not a compliment . 
Congratulations to all of my seniors graduating today at the Kente Stole Ceremony . When I say I love you guys , I truly mean it . The words that would properly express the depth of my love and gratitude for you all don't exist . It's been a pleasure just being in the company of so many people who are destined for great things . 
I'm sick and tired of having to do things alone . 
thank you , colgate wisp , for praising the virtues of public skankiness in clubs . yes , it is important to have fresh breath while kissing someone you met three songs ago 
getting back to the world of facebook blasts .... i noticed that , upon a second look , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE>'s friend < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > grandy is not particularly cute at all . 
my older sister salima just asked if she could brush or comb my eyebrows , and was surprised when I said no and started laughing . surreal . and hilarious . 
I hope kobe fouls out . And by foul out , I mean both get his 6th foul and finally go to jail for rape due to new evidence brought to the case 7 years later 
I really do think that living a good life is as simple as being completely honest with yourself and others , giving in to your good nature , and giving every moment and every person all you have to give 
nate robinson looks just like the lil black kid from role models . 
despite all thats happened to myself and others when it comes to personal relationships , i refuse to become a skeptic and stop believing in the inherent goodness of most people 
as a general rule , u shouldnt trust anybody over 25 with 1000 facebook friends . somethings usually wrong . 
I'm eons and eons beyond these peons . another one like me ? there will never be one 
< PROPFIRST > Hendry , for the last time .... its not arrogance . i just know that im not a lame lol 
USA = Team Heart Attack 
she claims she can through a one-step drop fade . haven't seen it in action yet . but the fact that she knows what it is is a definite plus . possible marriage material . 
i still dont quite understand how some of u females keep from throwing yourselves at me . its rather amazing . in other news , birthday shindig july 9 . dinner at stanleys in wilmington at 8 , despicable me afterwards . invite urself , but lemme know if ur coming 
ok , let's be real . \I'm not ready for a relationship right now\ " = \ " I don't want to be in a relationship with YOU . \ " I defy any of you to bring forward evidence to prove otherwise lol " 
lebron just broke my heart . I hope he does well . 
R.I.P. < PROPFIRST > Steinbrenner . Though he's one of the many reasons I hate the Yankees , he was a great man and icon in the worlds of baseball , sports , and society . He is largely responsible for the game of baseball as we know it today , and that should count for something . In unrelated news ... might anyone know the burial rites for sith lords ? 
the best thing about having such a big heart is that it can endure hundreds of < PROPFEMALE > rips and tears without breaking . there's still that one indefensible spot , though ... 
I'm sorry , but this is who I am ! you can't ask a bird not to fly . you can't ask a fish not to swim ! you can't ask a tiger not to turn back into a chinese dude at midnight !! 
* sighs * so many people pulling me in sooo many directions . i can't please everyone . i'm dedicating my immediate future to looking out for myself and my interests . the more people i can help along the way , the better . but i'm going to try to take it much slower . and i'm going to need a lot of help . day-to-day advice will be much appreciated .

im tired of people letting me down ... but its soooo hard to not put my emotions in things !! id rather just risk the heartbreak and put myself around people who are unlikely to cause it . i know its a recurring theme with me , but if yall would just be dependable , it wouldnt be . so there . 
< PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > implied that there is a stereotype that blacks dont use tape recorders . what do you think ? 
I can almost feel the tears ... and it's not even from the onions . is my expectation for people to act according to their words unreasonable ?

619 : first of all , i'm somewhat alarmed at your amazingly quick response lol that said , though , u cool peoples . how come we don't see each other anymore ?? i blame you . seriously , tho , we should probably < PROPFEMALE > out soonish . ur one of the blackest white gurls i know . and i mean that in a good way , for a c < PROPFEMALE > e 
812 : we aint talked in a madd long time ... im honestly one of those out of sight , out of mind people . honestly , i don't know what role we're supposed to play in each other's lives , so i don't put any particular effort into playing one . that said , i am here for you and i will always continue to be in any capacity that i can :) 
776 : WORD i been crushin u since like , day one in ms. richards english class . i've expect a certain level of commitment from u , and u haven't responded to it , but i still expect u to for some reason . and honestly , i think you're just scared of falling for someone . your dreams about me let me know that i'm on your mind relatively frequently . but that's coo , too . i got mad love for u , and i'm not one to ever stop . 
42 : i cant adequately put my love for u into words . u've always been my favorite , and i < PROPFEMALE > every single moment that we spend together and our two-year twin connection . u used to resent bein compared to me , but it seems that u've matured out of that now with ur own life . i'm soooo proud of u !! but u still have a lot of growing to do . i love u and ill always be here for u 
141414 : what can i say ... you're my favorite of ur significant clan . we should really < PROPFEMALE > out more , but i love the way its always a mutual thrill to see each other . u could kick me out more movie tickets ... but thats not important . i feel like we were put in each others lives for a reason , and im excited to flesh that reason out . i love you , and i don't say that lightly 
267 : we get it , u from philly . but nah , ive enjoyed my time with u since the moment we met . i LOVE ur energy ! plus , u cute ; i'd hit lol ur a wonderful person . you'll go far in life . but take it from me : it's hard to keep that energy up . surround urself with positive ppl thatll recharge ur batteries properly . and never settle for no sucka mc dude . but keep in mind that i'll always be here for u , even when i've left ud 
1027 : seriously , when i saw ur message , my face lit up . i love u from the bottom of my feet ( hearts too high ) . i admire u so much for staying organized and keeping everything together . i need u to help me plan my stuff for next semester especially lol and don't forget about our lil * ahem * project . and u have me pegged so well in that respect . but you've always been dependable and a great friend and i love u for that 
21 : ur just the cutest lil thing ... i love ur warmth and energy . my heart leaps each time i see u and ur eyes speak volumes -- i love that too but i dont wanna get mushy . it sucks that we're so busy cuz i wanna < PROPFEMALE > out with u more . this is my last year ! but im truly happy to have u in my life . even i get down sometimes ; but u can always help bring me back up . reliable friends in that respect r extremely hard to find . 
#20 : where the flip have u been ?? i havent seen u in forever , and i blame u . but nah , u coo ppls . like that time u introduced me to pretty wings ( now i have the album ) or the time we had much too long of a conversation where im pretty sure i convinced u that i think the earth is flat . that was fun lol lets grab lunch sometime , tho . and ill definitely be at at least a couple of ur games 
18 !!! : im still kinda salty that u betrayed us for pitt ... but its coo . ( i almost ended up goin there myself lol ) i hope everythings goin well for u out there . still , tho , if u need anything at all , lemme know . i gotchu .

from atlanta to < PROPFEMALE > , can anyone stop that ? not when God got His hands on me , only the strong survive , and the weak-minded are falling by the wayside . they try , but we shall overcome and succeed , indeed , with success there comes a great responsibility ; we chose to lead , not follow , its a hard pill to swallow . better get prescriptions filled , ' cause there may not be tomorrow
