Saw ' Hot Tub Time Machine ' ( which was very funny ) , found a $10 < PROPMALE > while walking , and been listening to \Mephisto Waltz\ " by Mephisto Walz near non-stop today . I'm a sucker for atmospheric music . x_x ; " 

Happiness is an illusion , yet still needs to be earned . I'm falling away from happiness . Jadey , come visit ? 
Looked in the back of my drawer and found a pair of good socks that were mismatched . Also found my Dead Kennedys shirt . Looking hard enough always brings up everything you've ever wanted . Wearing my \Paradise Bobcats\ " PE shirt today . " 
Feeling the love . <3 It's pale , thin , and warm ... wait , that's just me . Love you guys . <3 <3 <3 
Out of the deep and dark realm of the internet ... I found another Deathrocker by pure < PROPMALE > . Tonight was well spent . 
Life is a wild and scarey thing . You never know what tomorrow may bring . http://chatter.com/a/7smzy?ref=nf 
It's funny when you want to voice your opinion and what you like , then you find out no one really gives a shit and the people who you're talking to try to jump over or around what you're saying to something that they care about and you don't . xD 
For when you've got a lot to say , but you're saying it to all the wrong people ... and the people you need to say a lot to are just out of touch . 
Uh oh ... I hope I'm not getting sick . ;~; 
I just watched a porno with D.I. playing a live show while two couples were going at it . Funny shit . 
When you live your life at night , you kind of miss the small things ... like open public places ... and fast food joints . 
\Showwwwwerrrr ! \ " deh duh duhhh \ " It's shower time ! \ " deh deh duh deh duh deh ( 15 BATBUX if you can name the song I'm referencing . ) "

My sister , Olivia : \Doug 
I just graduated high school ! Wow , it really feels great . <3 <3 <3 
Oh wow ! Going on a vacation to Germany ! 
Off to San < PROPFIRST > again . Wish me luck with the whole passport deal . ^_^ ; 
Sitting in the car with the windows rolled down is something like a hot fudge sundae . The overbearing heater and the ice cold wind . It's awesome . 
Am I doin ' it rite ? 
Went to St. Pauli and the harbor yesterday . Walked through an area that was heavily bombed during WWII and all the buildings were brand new and modern . Went to the outside of the club where the Beatles played and got famous . Felt like I was to get raped by women when walking through the red light district . 
Fuck being cool . It's a load of shit . Disregard that , I suck chicken . Fuck hipsters . 
I found the necklace < PROPFIRST > made me . I had lost it and I was really sad about it , but now I can happily wear it all the time like I did before . xP 
playing Fire Emblem Sacred Stones as usual on the trusty SP when Knoll , my Summoner , scored FIVE criticals in a row ! Unheard of at level 11 with Flux . Awesome ! 
I rub my feet together while I'm in bed . Is this a telltale sign of being a cuddler ? it feels so goooood . 
You ever find that some things are better not changed ? 
Just in case you're going to be playing the new community playlist in Halo : Reach , watch out for jetpacks . There's tons of camping spots and jetpacks ruin the gameplay . 
If I put three dollar's worth of very warm spange from my pocket into the refridgerator , what will happen ? 
Been playing Halo 2 all day . Goooooood memories . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is a fuckin ' stud . 
Listening to a lot of the New Wave and 80's music I used to listen to with my dad when I was really young . So amazing . 
Today was amazing . Ah . /: { D > 
After listening to the Theatre of Ice tape releases on Youtube , I have the morale to start up another band ... solo or otherwise . <3 
Didn't do too well on the ACCUPLACER . I have a terrible memory . Also , I'm a better storyteller than I am a serious writer . 
One of these days , I want to get a huge list of things I hate or dislike . #237 : Roleplay \Families\ " or \ " Clans\ " . Get over yourself . " 
I want Buffalo Wild Wings . MAHONEEEEEEYY ! Let's get dem wings . 
Yesterday was an oddly good and lucky day . Skyrim trailer came out , got a haircut , found a twenty crumpled at the bottom of a pocket , found the necklace that < PROPFIRST > Munoz made me , found a bunch of change , and got tons of music . It was sweet . :D 
I can see for < PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE > . 
Fucking hate Black Ops . It's like World at War , but surprisingly even fucking worse . 
heat tree coif : Theatre of Ice . See it ? I woke up because < PROPFIRST > stole my delicious hearty sandwich and replaced it with ... -cheesy oldies horror suspense music- a thin little veggies lover sandwich which I immediately threw across the room . < PROPFIRST > . Give me back my cheese , egg , bacon , and turkey sandwich which was like four inches thick of dead animal goodness . Thank you . 
Spent some time with Lynnsey . Hell yeah . Also got two Hazelnut Milka bars , a dark chocolate with Hazelnut Ritter Sport , and a Toblerone . All hail < PROPMALE > and Swiss chocolates !
