Yeah , the child in the mirror was homely , so he learned early on how to switch into low key . Little person , observant and accurate , grew the skills to argue and the passion to back it with . Kick over the blocks just to re build em ' cause mom and pop used to pop , sound familiar ? Daddy had to leave , but momma kept hurtin so he stepped up to help be an anchor and a burden .

I'm on my iPod touch And it's awesome lol . I love the rain sometimes 
work starts today at 10 am and I probably wont get home until around 10 pm . longest I've ever worked , but im really happy . money is money and the opportunity cost is not great enough to make me not want to work . 
worked over 10 hours tday ... im pretty exhausted but feel great at the same time 
If today was your last day , and tomorrow was to late , could you say goodbye to yesterday ? Would you live each moment like your last , leae old pictures in the past , donate every dime you have , if today was your last day . 
Lets take it back to the plan , me and my momma hopped in that U-Haul < PROPFIRST > . Any pessismists I aint talk to them , plus I didnt have a phone in my apartameeent - Kanye lol 
The time you stole from me is time that i'll never get back . your slippin , like a tight rope with slack you've lost your grip 
Lately ive been hard to reach . Ive been too long on my own . Are you callin me , are you tryin to get through , are you reacing out for me , I'm reaching out to you . 
Finally 18 .. and graduated 
The time is getting closer my friends . I am free very soon from the shackles and I will use my freedom to its fullest extent , nothing shorter then my best . This is 18 years in the making .. 
I'm layin down the law cuz the last straw is broken . You think that life is a game ? its no joke because you choked and you failed ... 
I am currently falling Asleep in a tent . Goodnight everyone 
Well I slept in the tent . Too bad I'm tall and couldn't stretch out all the way ... 
Psych < PROPMALE > shall be fun :) 
Well , tomorrow is the day , and i cant sleep just yet ... 
The Sun is gonna rise in a mile ... 
Today was overwhelming to say the least 
you know you failed but I never sweat it , never regret it , never let it get inside of my head , or get embedded . 
The world of isolation requires deep thought but little action , long strides but minimal improvements , and a big heart but little < PROPFEMALE > . 
Carlina said no more sad status ' . This one will be happy . yay :) 
This summer has definitely been a growing experience for me . Thank you to those who have been there throughout . I'm absolutely blessed to have you and I couldn't be happier with the way things have turned out . This is my first facebook post in a long time .. 
You are the only execption 
I am officially moved in . 
In the days of kings and queens I was a jester . They treat me like a god or the treat me like a lepper . You see me move back and forth between both . I'm tryin to find a balance I'm tryin to build a balance . 
I'm gonna be what I set out to be without a doubt undoubtabley and all those who look down on me I'm tearin ' down your balcony . 
When the rain falls\ 
and the night crawls down\ 
yeah you got me here\ 
In the Humdrum town\ 
In this Humdrum town ... 
With the same sword they night me they're gonna \good night\ " me with . \ 
I am < PROPFIRST > The Oracle , and I predict Hot Ham and Cheese for Lunch Tomorrow . 
I love being the only person out of 425 students who participates in the lecture . 
got an exam on thursday that I feel ready for ! 
time to kill this exam . Need that 100% yo ! 
better has gotten an A on that psych exam 
104% on my psych exam and 103% on my math exam . BOOYAH College ! Time to kill this sociology exam . 
Props to all the mothers and women out there who pretty much raise their children on their own . I agree with < PROPFIRST > its gotta take a lot for a woman to raise a boy into a man . 
I'm losing my girlfriend to a 438 year old man .. the pain ... the agony ... :( 
If you are what you say you are , then have no fear . 
Was it something I said or something I did , did my words not come out right ? Though you tried not to hurt me , though you tried ... but I guess thats why they say every < PROPFEMALE > has its thorn . 
Maybe I'm alone in this one , but whenever I pictured a wriglet , it was always male . I have never thought of wrigley creating a female wriglet . Cannot compute . Syntex Error . 
instead of finding a solution to the problem , lets go back to the creation of the problem . way to go USA , we know how successful republican's were during the Bush Administration when our economy went down the toilet , lets forget about that in two years and screw us all over some more . yay . Sorry , just needed to let that out . I wont be responding to comments . I dont want to debate . just gotta let loose . 
Never take something at face value . Question it , and prove it wrong or right . Dont just stand by and let things happen . Be the change you want to see in the world . 
You cant let these obstacles run your life forever . You've gotta take the reigns , no matter the weather . 
one sociology exam down today , one psychology exam to go . gotta keep this streak alive . nothing but 100% or better on any exam . 
< PROPFEMALE > remember when they aint believe in me ? now shes like \see ! \ " thats my cousin on T.V. " 
Time to get back to this paper ! 
goodnight facebook , and I miss you < PROPFEMALE > .

And so he kick push , \ 
Over his shoulder he swore he'd never look , \ 
cuz wasn't nothin ' back there but the blackness , \ 
Life wasn't too attractive . 
Another late night doing research for this darn paper . I've got over 15 scholarly , peer reviewed sources already , and I feel like I'm never going to be done .. 
Some stress down . Tons left to go through . 
I aint got ; I aint got much to lose ! 
Tryin to pay them student loans , and the lights and the phone and the food and the home . \ 
Any you aint quite broke but you couldnt afford that place on your own . \ 
Got a roomate to split the rent wit\ 
now you'll never feel independent\ 
and everything seems so hollow\ 
cuz after work , where'd that smile go ? 
Congrats for winning the < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > Contest < PROPFEMALE > !! I love you and you deserve it . its awesome to see your painting in the newspaper and and it be cool to go to all the McDonalds in Southeastern Wisconsin and see it there as well in February . WOOHOO !! 
is studying for a math final tomorrow at 7:30 in the morning .. 
Write it down and remember , that we never gave in\ 
The mind of a child is where the revolution begins\ 
So if the solution has never been to look in yourself\ 
how is it that you expect to find it anywhere else ? 
I havent done laundry since last year 
And this house aint no home anytime , she goes away . 
Found several apartments in < PROPFEMALE > that are much cheaper then the dorms there , and actually have a kitchen , living room , and private bathroom lol . yay 
Post this as your status if you know someone who suffers from being a Chicago Bears fan . Being a Bears fan is a real disorder and should be taken seriously . There is no known cure for BFD and sympathy alone does not help ... but we can raise awareness . If you or a loved one suffers from BFD , call your doctor immediately , as this may be a sign of a rare but serious side effect to failure . 
Bears practice was delayed two hours after a player reported an unknown white powdery substance on the field . < PROPFEMALE > Smith immediately suspended practice as federal investigators were called . After a complete analysis , forensic experts found the white substance unknown to the players was the goal line . Practice resumed after agents decided the team was unlikely to encounter the substance again 
Its called the Lombardi Trophy for a reason . 
first day of second semester . here we go . 
figures , first day of second semester and im already staying up doing homework ... I suppose I should get used to this for the next few months . 
psych stats is still scary >.> But I shall get the A ! or die trying , then become reincarnated as someone who can get the A ! 
Got the beastiest present ever from the beastiest girlfriend ever . I love you < PROPFEMALE > Lindstrum ! 
< PROPFIRST > who ? 
just made myself some pancakes and they tasted so darn good . they didnt stick to the pan . Great Success ! 
This day changed fairly drastically .... Im tired . 
I wanna just take this timeout to be perfectly honest\ 
cuz theres a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside of my soul\ 
and just know that I grow colder the older I grow\ 
this boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold\ 
and this load is like the weight of the world\ 
and I think my neck is breakin'\ 
should I just give up ? Or try to live up to your expectations ? 
Well , it is official . I will be going to < PROPFEMALE > next year . 
Darn you < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > ... I needed to have a way to pay for grad school and being a < PROPFEMALE > could have worked . That dang proposal better not pass . 
Come inside\ 
Pick up your bags off the sidewalk\ 
Dont you hear sincerity\ 
In my voice when I talk\ 
Told ya this is my fault\ 
Look me in the eyeball\ 
Next time Im pissed\ 
Ill aim my fist\ 
At the dry wall\ 
Next time\ 
There wont be a next time\ 
I apologize\ 
Even though I know it's lies\ 
Im tired of the games\ 
I just want her back\ 
I know Im a liar\ 
If she ever tries to effin leave again\ 
Ima tie her to the bed\ 
And set this house on fire 
How the heck did < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > get elected without a college degree .. lol 
< PROPFEMALE > Public Schools are canceled again tomorrow . Teachers are standing up for what the need in order to function and give kids a quality education , and for that I applaud them all . 
2 state republican senators didnt show up today . props to them for standing for worker's rights . 
Spread the word for an MPS Teacher walkout tomorrow . 
I rallied today at UWM with Mr. Nelsen lol . fun time . 
ATTENTION THOSE OF YOU GOING TO MADISON :\ 
Bum me a ride so I can come and protest with you please ? :) Send me a message if possible . thanks . 
Just got back home from a long day of rallying with 50,000 strong people at the capitol today . < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is a great speaker . Im happy I did my part in < PROPFEMALE > and I'm going to keep doing what I can here . 
Yeah , so I see several birds flying out my window through the snow . Those birds must have been tricked by the week of 50 degree weather lol . fail . 
Dearest Wisconsin plow drivers , \ 
If there is excessive snow that needs to be dumped elsewhere please deliver massive , immoveable and impacted snow and ice to :\

Rally Tomorrow for union rights on water and Wisconsin Street at 4:30 to 6:00 pm . come to support your teachers , nurses , garbage men , and your own futures ! 
How do you know when < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > is talking ? \ 
When < PROPFIRST > Koch's lips move . 
Just got back from the rally in Downtown Milwaukee . Thanks to the thousands who came to support . 
two psych exams today that are ten minutes apart ... been studying my butt off for them . We'll see if it pays off later today . 
These budget issues have pinned me against some of my own family members . I wish I didn't have to see it go this far but when I truly believe in something , I need to fight for whatever it is no matter what . I care about you all , remember that . 
100% of physio exam after the curve . yepee ! 
< PROPFEMALE > is different but balanced in her love , she gives not to receive but to fill in the missing piece , but she doesnt look upon it as being something that is missing , but as something that needs to be reminded of what it is in its own divinity , she finds a piece of < PROPMALE > in even the simplest of things 
I didn't know you could screw up a grilled cheese . People in Cambridge Cafeteria are slow .... ( aside from wriggles , who I believe could make a decent grilled cheese ) 
oh , its on now . 
Some quotes from < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > .. 
What I don't understand is that < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > says we are in a huge financial crisis , and we can not afford to spend money , and must cut all of these different things , yet a month after he was elected , he put us 140 million dollars in debt by giving tax breaks to Wisconsin corporations . We would technically have a budget SURPLUS this year if he didn't do that , so tell me , where's this code red coming from < PROPMALE > ? 
Its up to YOU to take control of your future . No one else is going to do it for you . 
< PROPMALE > on Fox News this morning , \people have the right to protest but they will not overpower the millions of taxpayers who want to balance this budget\ " \ 
finally finished fafsa ... \ 
0 efc :) 
Just something I noticed ... \ 
By law , corporations have the same rights as human beings , so why are they not taxed the same as any human being ? In Wisconsin , corporations pay no taxes ... That is ridiculous to me . 
Wisconsin Gov . < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > said he is not worried how history will remember him “because if I have my way , there won’t be any history teachers . \ " , 2011-03-18 07:25:04 " 
So no matter what been through , no matter what you into\ 
No matter what you see when you look outside your window\ 
Brown grass or green grass , picket fence or barbed wire\ 
Never ever put them down , you just lift your arms higher\ 
Raise em til your arms tired , let em know you here\ 
That you struggling , survivin , that you gon persevere\ 
Aint nobody leavin , nobody goin home\ 
Even if they turn the lights out , the shows goin on 
\Crooked banks around the World\ 
Today I just finished over 10 pages of writing for my English 150 class , as well as over 100 pages of article reading .. it took last night and all of today , but I am now finished , and I feel accomplished . 
pray for an old friend of mine who is in the hospital right now please . 
Take me to that old , familiar place\ 
Take me to memories we won't erase\ 
Take me to all that we had\ 
The good and the bad\ 
I'll Never forget you 
I guess I'm no fun :( 
I normally don't feel like swearing , but I feel like shit today .
