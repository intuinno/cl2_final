Worried about Baloo . Two vets at different facilities and no diagnosis ... :~( Treating symptomatically for now . Don't let your animals get sick on a Sunday ! 
And he did it ! Soft BM but NO BLOOD ! ( I thought it would be wrong to post a pic ) . 6 more days of antibiotics and I will be relaxed . He has tons of energy ! 
OK . Baloo is back to his normal self . He again is starting to pull the satellite cable from the wall . I just paid $50 to get this fixed .
