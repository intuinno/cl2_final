Just spent 4 hours working on band accounts -- ugh ! Time for a break . 

Didn't realize facebook was going to be such a commitment -- I just responded to more than 30 pending requests . Maybe Vikie is right and I have sent too many friend requests ... 
My first Facebook block . Should I really be surprised that it was a Kleinsmith \friend \"?" 
Jazz Police ... Nothing like a great Goodwin Big Phat Band tune to top your evening - especially when your kid is in the band . Solid . 
Heard an awesome concert today . There was this group of high school students playing some incredible concert band music and ... Hey ! That's < PROPMALE > on Alto Sax ! 
Looking forward to the Circuit Assembly this weekend . Guaranteed to be just what I need . Praying my heart will be open to receive it all and act on it . 
< PROPMALE>'s Missouri All-State Honor Band concert is tomorrow . Hope to get a good recording to share with anyone who can't make it . 
Got to All-State venue about 12:45 ... choir is performing ... jazz is at 1:30 and concert band at 2:30 ... gonna get great seats I think to myself ... foolish man ! Even after choir parents leave there must be 300 people already waiting for band ! Fortunately , found exactly 5 seats 8 rows back . The bands were amazing . Even better than expected . And , of course , my child was the /most/ amazing . :-) 
Faith is personal , but not private . Woe would be me had Jesus and the apostles thought such . 
Why do most of my family members show up in the facebook family list without pictures or links ? Have they all blocked me ? ( Not that I'd blame them ... )
