The key to life isn't in unlocking all of it's mysteries , but rather , in scrutinizing it's complexities 
Many are under the dellusion that they're headed to heaven when in reality their actions qualify them for a different distination ! 
They say , '' Burdens are lifted at Calvary '' I disagree ! Calvary is but a bitter sweet reminder of our morbid realiity ! Jesus is the only Burden Lifter !
