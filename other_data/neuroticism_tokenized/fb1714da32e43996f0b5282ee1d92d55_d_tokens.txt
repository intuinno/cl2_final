is off to a Napa Valley Grill interview . Wish me luck !! 

I landed the job !!!!!!! WHOO-HOO !!! 
Mun < PROPFIRST > n ' on a smorgisboard of cheeses from work , along with a bottle of Gnarly Head pinot grigio from work ( at cost ) , < PROPFEMALE > Kraus radio station and a freshly cleaned house . OH , and a hansome man dialoguing with me about feng shui and healthy < PROPFIRST > . Life i 
woke up early , spent hours at the beach , a little face painting , relaxing time , and now I'm off to sound session with < PROPFEMALE > !!!!! Anyone wanna join , call me ! 530 209-3076 
had a dream I saw 8 giraffs running along a sideroad , about to die from starvation . tried to call 911 but my phone kept dialing other < PROPFIRST > . Weird huh ? Then I was taking care of a new born puppy at < PROPFEMALE > Aniston's party by keeping it warm in my mouth 
being fired is so much simpler than quitting ! 
$1.99 for fillet mignon+the best cook EVER = a VERY delicious evening !! Thank you Jeffy !! 
La la la la life goes on ! 
Last night I let < PROPFEMALE > know that I'm trying not to interrupt her so often . As I said this , she told she didn't know what I was talking about . And we understood each other perfectly . 
$26 for quite a bit of food at Aldi's . I'm lovin ' this $-managing thing , oh and making my own food , like the fillet < PROPFEMALE > I'm cooking right now ! 
I know this is risky , but here it goes : I don't believe anyone should get married before living together first . I don't care how well you think you know someone , YOU DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER UNTIL YOU LIVE TOGETHER ! It's my personal opinion that moving in is a much healthier option than the pressure of marriage . Give it a year , THEN decide . 
Going for a job at the Hasbro Children's Hospital as an \Artist assistant in Pediatrics\ " Wish me luck !! " 
Trying to get home for a visit before school . Anyone want to donate to the \Dani's extremely homesick\ " fund ? " 
I was told tonight by a very handsome man at Jerkey's that I'm a sexy vegetable . He said he should know cuz he's a vegetarian !! 
\Water for Elephants\ " Read it ! " 
Alright , so far the plan is graduate school , move home for a couple months , save up for my plane ticket , then join the Peace Corps in Fiji ! THEN , I will be a voice to artists everywhere about the importance of community and/or international service . 
\somebody save me ! Take me away from this aweful place ! \"" 
Appearantly my old < PROPFEMALE > boss decided to ban me from my old pub . I understood when someone said I may be banned for the required 3 months after employment , but my old bosses cloned < PROPFEMALE > told me I'm personally banned . He's bought the other quitees drinks and let Mick storm out then have his wedding reception there a week later , but I'm a threat . What a < PROPMALE > ! 
off to buy groceries with money I don't have 
would like to remind everybody that she's still alive 
Took the kids to the park yesterday , ended up chatting with a gorgeous man for an hour , meeting < PROPFEMALE > , having drinks with our animal farm , met and had life revelations with a < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > instructor , then heard a fantastic live Blues show . Off to the park now , we'll see where it leads today :) 
bored and need some adventure ... give a ring if you got it ! 
and the rain rain rain came down down down ... 
\He once had an awkward moment just to see how it feels . \"" 
The pink is gone and now , as < PROPFEMALE > puts it , my hair is the color of dried blood . Somebody's been watching a little too much True Blood ..... 
is experiencing a powerful Wanderlust ! 
I'm thoroughly enjoying my recent change in circumstances ;D 
I'll never forget you Swayze !! 
Got a job cooking in the kitchen at RISD . Somebody's got to put food on my table ! 
why don't I enjoy making < PROPMALE > anymore ? 
Doing a semester long project of a circus with hand-made dolls ! This is gunna be more than awesome !! 
I HAVE MY OWN INTERNET !!!!!!!! Nothing could make me happier right now ! 
went to a small lecture of an old swiss satirist-illustrator who gave a convincing rant on how terrible \Where the wild things are\ " . Haven't seen it yet but I've heard everyone leaves depressed . Is this the general consensus ? " 
i have a cold :( 
studying the ducal studioli of < PROPMALE > de Montefeltro in Gubbio and Urbino ... wish me luck on my mid term tomorrow ! 
was directly involved in the process of cooking the best beef stew I've ever tasted !!! I never realized making such things at home was possible . The things you know . 
Me+Amie = Scary Clowns in Olneyville ! ROCK ON !!!!!!! 
Oh what a night ... 
I've grown very fond of my boys at work . 
I might be retarded , but what does \imoa\ " stand for ? You cantankerous kids and your flippidy-floppidy language ! " 
still haven't seen Where The Wild Things Are :( 
GOOD MORNING !!!!! My class is having a show , Dec 8th , < PROPFIRST > the calender . I'll let you know where . Come by and see my seedy clown puppet circus ! ( some of you know where the ISB building is . ) 
< PROPFEMALE > and I went to a Raggae concert at Lupos . it was great ! We both drank a little too much , but we're home safe and she is currently sleeping it off on my couch . 
I wanted to go to Cirque Mechanics more than ANYONE , and like a moron I waited til the OSL office is closed . Does anyone have an extra ticket ? I'll owe you the world !!! 
I'm really trying hard not to cry over this and now I have to work on a research paper . DAMN PROCRASTINATION !!! 
Eatin some icecream , waiting for < PROPFEMALE > to meet me so we can go to the Cirque Mechanics show . YAY ! 
life is beautiful and full of promise . Don't forget it when you post your thoughts ! I refuse to be bummed out by your pessimism ! 
I wish I had a ride to studio :( 
Heard a story last night that some dumb ass 21 year old posted photos of himself holding his shotgun in a RISD dorm room . His roommate says he's harmless , just a gun fan and a moron ! 
Black Rep last night with my girls , < PROPFEMALE > , Em , and Ayla . Em woke up with someone elses leather jacket , a cell phone that's not hers and has no recollection of the car-to-car interaction on the way home . Course , the rest of us know exactly what happened ... 
Forgot to plan Thanksgiving this year and now the liquor stores are closed ! :( 
Happy Turkey Day everyone ! If you need us , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > and I will be at the bar having some food and sharing a few laughs . 
Everything is such a Haze ! < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > and I spent Thanksgiving together . Good thing we didn't see the bag of feathers last night or the mess would have been worse this morning ! 
I was surprised ! The day after Thanksgiving there weren't too many iridescent cobwebs in my mind to brush out . Great memories though ! 
About to enjoy some home-made Chevre and Butternut squash manicotti . Had Crab , Filet , and Stuffies last night . This whole cooking thing is turning out to be a piece of cake ! Mmmmm ... cake ... 
I need someone to watch my ferrets while I'm in CA Dec 24th-Jan 6th . I would rather leave them at someone's house where they can have some human interaction and a little play time . They're adorable , playful , do some tricks and Boots loves to sleep in my arms . They do have a distinct smell which some can't handle , but it doesn't bother me . Let me know if you're interested , I'll owe you if you're the one !! :) 
It's the end of a good week . Now for the final push ! 
Really don't want to go to studio tonight , but I gotta get it done . This semester needs to end ! CAN I GET AN AMEN ?!! 
I will be taking a break from facebook for a while . Those of you who love me have my number , if you feel like exchanging voices give me a call . 
I have to rejoin Facebook to remind everyone of my upcoming show ! My piece \Cirque du D'anielle\ " which features interactive mechanical puppets will be included and so will my clown costume . The show is at the ISB building ( google it ) 6:30 pm- 8:30 pm Thursday night . There will be food and hot beverages . Support the culture of the arts ! COME SEE MY SHOW !! " 
I've found an angel to watch my babies while I'm gone ! Thank you thank you thank you Matty ! < PROPFEMALE > Christmas everyone ! 
Just finished a fantastic dinner made by moi , drinking egg nog and cuddling with < PROPFEMALE > and Boots while we watch the Muppets new christmas special . Ah yes , this is the life ... 
I can't wait to see my family and friends in California !!! Now , if only I wasn't so broke . Oh well , we'll have fun anyway ! See you guys soon !! 
Christmas family portrait , here I come ! 
I'm sitting here watching Casablanca . It's Dec 21 2009 6:23 pm and I'm sad to realize that this minute will never happen again . Once it's gone it's gone forever . Why does time go by so fast ? 
I am enraged when hypocrites post godly messages online pretending that they are in any way close to God . Give me a massive break ! Take off the mask , it's ugly !!! And choose a f&*^ing side already !!!!!!! 
I really need a ride to the airport at 4am tomorrow . Anyone up for an early morning adventure ? If you haven't done a good deed for Christmas then this could be your < PROPMALE > ! ( 530 ) 209-3076 
Made a wonderful meal with Mom and Sis . Had two strangers over for dinner with the fam and had a blast ! < PROPFEMALE > CHRISTMAS !!! 
Watched the old \Christmas Carol\ " with the family . < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > scared me . I think he was cast for \ " The Omen\ " and wondered onto the wrong set . " 
My mom has two finches that keep laying eggs that don't hatch . I half way thought about frying the one they have to see what it tastes like . Is that wrong ? 
I get to have a slumber party with my favorite girls tomorrow night ! I just hope Mech will be there then it'd be perfect !!!! 
I start my independent study at Big Nazo on Thursday !!!!! 
I got a tattoo ! 
I have to get back on a plane today :( I love to travel but I HATE TO FLY !!!!!!! Does anyone feel this way or am I alone ? 
I'm home !!!!!!!!!! 
Good news all over ! I don't start with Big Nazo til Monday , I get to work with my favorite people all weekend , I get the rest of today off , and Matty is bringing my babies home to me ! And I get to work a ton this month so I can make some moolah !! Life is beautiful today . 
I forgot to tell my friends my cell is out of commission . I can get texts and missed calls for the moment , but I can't reply . 
Eating an incredible dish of Cajun salmon with pureed parsnip , mashed potatoes/parsnips , and Rainbow bright greens . ( or maybe it's just rainbow ) went to a hookah bar last night with some of my favorite girls , and tomorrow I'm helping Big Nazo make warts for the Vancouver Olympics ! * sigh * my life is pretty much fantastic !! 
I would have liked to go on a date tonight too . But hanging out with < PROPFEMALE > was just as fun ! 
< PROPFEMALE > and I got a little carried away last night . It involved alot of dancing , smoking and drinking , and a little darts til after 3am . I think my spine is broke . 
I'm ready to fall in love . Where are you my Sweet ? 
New Years Resolution #14 : Stop watching romantic comedies ( or possibly watch a whole lot more of them ) Talk to me ladies , what do you think ?

I had a lazy day yesterday , enjoyed it very much ! Now it's back to work , and since I love my job , I've got nothin but smiles !!! :D 
I suppose there's always things I COULD be doing , but all I WANT to do is < PROPFEMALE > with some buddies and do nothing at all . 
Oh My God ! AVATAR !! OH MY GOD !!! 
I'm making steak tacos , or chicken , and I even have cilantro ! Anyone interested in coming by ? I'll share ! 
Just finished < PROPFEMALE>'s Ashes and I can't figure out why it's called that . 
\Hand wash with mild soap ; dry with a soft cloth . \ " < PROPMALE>'s Education Souarce Book . " 
I just looked out every window of my house to see if I can see the gigantic < PROPFEMALE > and I can't . That's a bummer . 
If you & I woke up in jail together ... using only FOUR words ... what would you say to me ? Copy and paste this in your status and see what your friends say .... ( And if you make a comment , you gotta put this in your status . Come on , fair is fair 
Just got back from a Muslim party where I did face painting . Made $100 in 3 hours and brought back WAY TOO MUCH homemade Indian food and cupcakes . They made me take them . Who's coming over to share this with me ? 
You make me want to wear dresses . 
I'm craving a hug 
I've been inspired to create a circus/face painting show ! Time for some research into all thing circus !! 
The way the sun in shining , the falling snow looks like the air is filled with sparkles !

All by myself ... don't wanna be ... all by myself ... anymoooooreeeee ... 
I DON'T like the new facebook look ! 
Baby #3 at 24 ?! Sure , Sweetheart , you keep pretending your life isn't totally depressing . 
i love watching the ferrets play . Today is Boots ' 2nd birthday ! 
I've just strengthened my resolve to become a spanish guitarist 
I've had an overwhelming sense of loving life all weekend ! 
< PROPMALE > Delafon reads of an Arabic poetic form called qasida—which , according to some ninth century writer , may be about almost anything , but ‘should begin with the evocation of lost dwelling places and lost love , continue with the description of a journey , and culminate in the real subject . ’ 
In fact , the house where < PROPMALE > lives , and has lived for years , and where he will continue to live , he considers his lost home ; < PROPFEMALE > , in his arms , his lost love . 
I went to a poetry reading tonight to hear this old , old professor read his poems , of which the following is a clip . After , I had a long , enjoyable conversation with him about < PROPMALE > and poetry . Needless to say I thoroughly enjoyed myself . 
I'm convinced there's nothing in the world as good as HORSERADISH ! My face is about to explode and it's WONDERFUL ! 
I emailed < PROPMALE > yesterday . I have class today . 1-6 . I'm sorry < PROPFEMALE > , I assumed he was going to tell you and get someone to cover . 
Started back at the gym today ( I say \back\ " and it's been 6 years ) but I'm feeling great and looking even better with my new makeup and diet . I'm pretty sure this healthy thing is going to stick this time and my body is loving me for it ! " 
i left my atm card in the atm and it wasn't there when i went back :( 
my car will make it back home ! YAY !!!!!!! Looks like another cross-country drive is in order . . .

I'm having one hell of a day :( 
I went to 3 museums in New York today . I am exhausted !!! And over whelmingly inspired ! 
Wow . It's 38F outside and I just walked home thinking to myself how warm it is tonight . I must truly be a New Englander now . I'm gonna be roasting in CA ! 
a girl in my class made a doll out of used tea bags . I made meth babies with sugar crystals . 
I think , no I'm pretty sure I want to be involved in theater . Is it bad that I have no experience ? 
My new obsession is beauty . My skin is as soft as a baby's bottom and I'm changing my toenail polish from Easter orange to nude . 
Was last night daylight savings ? That explains why I slept in ' til 1:30 pm . I thought I was just lazy ! 
Also , best grilled cheese sandwhich IN THE WORLD includes brie cheese , black < PROPMALE > ham and ( correct me if I'm wrong boys ) apricot chutney ? It's phenominal ! ( and I don't use that word lightly , or know how to spell it ) 
I want to go on a vacation for spring break !! Who's with me ? 
Why don't I have plans for tomorrow yet ?! 
I'm in a St Paddys day parade tomorrow ! I get to wear a crazy creature costume and stand on a float waving to the drunken crowd in < PROPFEMALE > ! I guess the Boston parade was a rainy one so this one should be HUGE . 
My team won the dart championship ! This means $200 , a ceremony in our honor and trophy #2 . I love being a winner ! 
Why am I so blue ?

My < PROPMALE > sale was a raging success !! I made over $900 . Yep , people LOVE my jewelry . * sigh * success tastes so sweet . 
I'm in love with a man who doesn't know it . 
I wore a Big Nazo costume for a crowd invasion at a college outside of Boston . My shoulder blades are so bruised from the harness !!!! But it's always worth it ! 
I guess I went a little crazy on Ebay the other night . I keep getting emails telling me I've won watch parts from all over the country ! Damn my spontaneity !! 
Just took Boots for a little adventure around the block . He walked next to me like a pro ! He's so cute sometimes I can't stand it !!!

I'm so incredibly home sick ! 
I'm beginning to see : flattering a guy feeds his ego , ego's become powerful and pretentious , knocking down his self-esteem trains his ego to obey me , therefor men like to be treated like dirt , they just don't know it . Thoughts ? 
So who's drivin to Sac town to take me OUT tomorrow ?! You lovely b*tches know you want me ! 
Thanks for all the birthday wishes everyone ! Thanks to my mom and sister I had a blast !!! 
I was just floating down the river in a tube , now driving through a town called \Cool \""
