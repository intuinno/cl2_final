finally starting 2 get what this shits about . kinda ..... baby steps 

wishing it would be 8 o clock already . i want 2 talk 2 her so bad . >.< 
i have no idea what i'm doing up this early . everything seems so hazy & out of focus right now . =/ 
It really is pointless for me to be us this early . But that's what i get for expecting she'd actually call me . i really wish i didn't rail that ateral so i could go back to sleep . oh well , might as well clean ...... txt ? 2535081992 
Die to all that is old and mechanical , only then will you truly be free . Take every sensation in for the moment it is there , for you must not try and < PROPMALE > that experience again . For time & experience are ever flowing . 
Have you ever felt like there was a bubble seperating your thoughts from everything else around you ? Like your external volume has been turned way down ? 
Things are starting to feel normal again finally . =/ still missing one thing ..... but i'm tired of letting \that\ " affect me ... " 
\We're a generation of men raised by women . I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need . \ " - < PROPMALE > Pitt as < PROPFIRST > Durton in \ " Fight Club\ " . I'm starting to think he was right . =/ Maybe I'll take that advice 2 heart ? lol " 
* Sigh * so tired of emotional solitude .... 4 the 1st time in over 2 years , i feel like i want something .... dare i say it ..... more than just a casual thing ..... 
Its as if i was meant to hear that proverb 2day after all that had transpired the night before . =) i will remember those words in the reformations to come . 
Time 2 work now ^-^ get those $1 items sold ! Lol DTC ( dollar tree crew ) 
OMFG !!!! My brother and I were smoking outside my apartments . And right when we finished the bowl , and a fucking big ass RACCOON came up behind my brother . And we fucking ran like hell ! XD We were way too high 4 that shit !!! XD 
Almost 2 work . Trying to let what happen last night not faze me . =\\ kinda harder than expected .. 
Christmas will never be the same again ................ ever .............. ever ............. ever .......... ever ......... ='( 
I guess plans can still get fucked up even in the new year . lol , its whatever , maybe i should take this time to renew my room and such . ^-^ i was thinking about moving shit around . 
yay ..... i get to wake up and plan my dad's ceremony on saturday . ugh , and i just found out my grandpa who i haven't seen in god knows how long is supposed to be there . This is going 2 be really .... awkward .... =/ 
just got back from my dad's ceremony . =/ not the best experience in the world . But I'm glad that even though i at 1st didn't want to share on the open mic , that I chose to be the last one up there . My dad would have been proud . =') 
I can't believe i get to stay in lakeview w/ < PROPMALE > & < PROPMALE > 4 the weekend ! ^-^ This should be an amazing adventure of epic proportions ! Margh ! XD 
Now , every time i am brought to this thought , i notice where there was once confidement and warmth , there is now a cold , lonely , and hollow replacement of emotion . And i cannot tell a soul why , for no one would understand , i < PROPFEMALE > this alone ...... 
My head still feels fuzzy , but maybe a visit to/from a friend would clear things up . I need to take myself out of , whatever the hell my minds been stuck in . Any takers ? Lol XP 
Woke up an hour ago , time to get on the grind and job search . Fun shit ..... never thought I'd have to worry about this again so quickly . Oh well ...... 
anyone know any retail/grocery stores hiring ? lol need ideas on places to apply . 
i sware , i better here something back . I've applied for 16 different retain/grocery jobs 2day alone . That's gotta be a new record 4 me . XP lol 
Sacrifice is my word of this year . Everything's become so complicated , so now I must make it clear . I've turned away from pleasurable distraction , right now I deserve no such thing . and if I'm willing to give it ALL away , maybe true happiness , my sacrifice , will bring . 
Watching Spartacus : Blood & Sand . This show has more nudity , sex , blood , and guts than any other show I've seen . Acting in it's not bad either . XP lol
