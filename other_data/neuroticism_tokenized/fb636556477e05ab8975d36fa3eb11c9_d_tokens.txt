I HATE PACKING ... this is why I never should have unpacked the little bit that I did unpack ... 
Last Official Day of Work at IMS 
First offical non-IMS day and what am I doing - going into the office to clean out my stuff b/c I didn't want to do it yesterday ... I should have done it yesterday

Went to the gas station to put air in my sister's tires ... AND saw a guy forget to take the gas hose out of his truck before he started to drive away - needless to say he pulled the hose right out of the gas machine and was driving away dragging the hose before another guy yelled and stopped him - A HOLE LOT OF CRAZY OUTSIDE 
So the snow came and the wind is insane ... as I have been helping my dad with shoveling , it makes me even more thankful that I usually don't need to worry about shoveling - thanks to all the building & grounds people that clear the parking lots & roadways on campus 
wow - I might work at the best place ever - faculty meeting canceled =) 
Getting myself mentally ready for more snow ... 
The snow is falling ... 
I'm loving the snow - so much out there ... \ 
And YES we do have school today b/c we are hard core !!! \ 
( and almost all the day students stayed over last night ) 
Yes - we have school today ... it actually makes life so simple not having to adjust plans due to snow days etc ... 
Lovin ' that tomorrow is heads holiday =) 
We have school no matter what ... but I am so tired of all this snow & feeling trapped by poor roads
