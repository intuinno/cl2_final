the rest of your life to be as meaningful as possible , engage in \ 
spiritual practice if you can . It is nothing more than acting out of \

more about others ' – and thereby find peace and happiness yourself .

We can think of honesty & dishonesty in terms of the relationship between appearance & reality . Sometimes these synchronize , often they do not ; but when they do , that is honesty , as I understand it . So we are honest when our actions are what they seem to be . When we pretend to be one thing but in reality we are something else , suspicion develops in others , causing fear . Fear is something we all wish to avoid .
