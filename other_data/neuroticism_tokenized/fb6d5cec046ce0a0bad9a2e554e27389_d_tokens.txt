Happy birthday to me!Don't feel as old as I am , but my body says otherwise .. :] 

Feelin older , my oldest son is 21 today ! Was born the day before mothers day in 1989 . WOW !! Wish I could see him more often than I get to . 
Spent 2 days at Casino in < PROPFEMALE > . Falls , NY , with my best friend . Spent most of time in hot tub and swimming . Nothing like getting out of Buffalo for few days , and for free !! 
Confirm 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas to all my friends , and family !! Seems strange to be having Christmas with my parents and not my daughter and grandson ! Sure will miss < PROPFIRST > getting up to see what < PROPFEMALE > brought him . :) 
Hate moving to a new city , leaving my friends behind n having to try to make new friends . Esp . when the only places I go is Church , my folks n home . At least the weather is MUCH better !! 
Thank you to everyone that wished me a happy birthday ! Had a good day .
