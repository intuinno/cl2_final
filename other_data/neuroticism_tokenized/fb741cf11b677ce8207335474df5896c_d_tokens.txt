is playing pond hockey , today ! 

It's fascinating to see a team win the first thirteen games of their season , and lose the last three in a row . It's also fascinating that I'm posting a football based status shortly before the Blackhawks are to take the ice . So I'll make this a Blackhawks status , as well . Go Hawks ? Yep . 
Do you know , for you I bleed myself dry ? For you I bleed myself dry . 
is so terrible at soccer . 
Seeing all these old Cubs/Sox games on Comcast Sports Net is bringing back a lot of memories . 
Do you know , for you I'd bleed myself dry ? For you I'd bleed myself dry . 
is having a tough time waiting for the iPhone firmware update to be available for download . 
I somehow got myself up to go play hockey at 6 in the morning even with my body aching and the sorest it has probably ever been . And it was a blast . I <3 hockey . Very much . 
The NHL Draft has fallen on my birthday ... again . Well , day two at least . But still . It's like a birthday present that God gives me every year . Except for the 2007 draft , when he decided for some reason to make it on the 21st ! 
NHL Draft is 6 days away . Free Agency 10 days away . I'm so excited ! But that also means we only have 10 more days before Havlat is a free agent . 
the Cubs can't seem to hold a lead today . 
If the Hawks lose Havlat ... then I will OFFICIALLY have nothing to live for . Sad and pathetic ... but true . ='( 
is off to play roller hockey with my G's . Peace , yo . 
Oh , somebody kill me please . Somebody kill me please . I'm on my knees ! Pretty , pretty please ! Kill me . I want to die ! Put a bullet in my heeeeeaaaaeeeeeaaaaaeeeeeeed . 
is sick of waking up in the middle of the night and not being able to go back to sleep . 
Father Chavez ... what a father he is . 
The Blackhawks are one of 7 teams Dany Heatley is very interested in being traded to . If we got Dany Heatley , oh my GOD . 
< PROPFEMALE > Fox is so freakishly thin . If she was my girlfriend , I would always be careful around her so as not to break her ! Good thing that's never gonna happen , I can't even get a fat girl . LOL 
I never meant to cause you trouble , I never meant to do you harm . 
\And this ball game is OVAH ... Yes ! ... HELL yes ! \ " - < PROPMALE > \ " Hawk\ " Harrelson after Podsednik's game winning single . " 
My Blackhawks wish-list for tomorrow's draft : < PROPFIRST > Moore [ 6th ranked North American skater . Defensemen . Hometown boy ! He's from Illinois and loves the Blackhawks ! Plus , we need to draft a defensemen ] or Magnus Paajarvi-Svensson [ Skilled LW with sizebut th 
Lights will guide you home , and ignite your bones . And I will try ... to fix you . 
WOW . Havlat is officially sounding like he's leaving . The Blackhawks skip out on < PROPMALE > Despres who would've been a STEAL at the 28th pick to get another \grit\ " and \ " character\ " player in Olsen . AND WE'RE MOVING BACKWARDS . AGAIN . FUCK . This is being a Black " 
Lights will guide you home , and ignite your bones . And I will try - to fix you . 
is jealous of people going to see The Fray . And very sad about < PROPFIRST > Mays . 
sign Khabibulin at a paycut , sign Havlat to a three year deal , and get rid of Huet ? I would cry tears of joy if they managed to do that . 
is watching the Avalanche @ Blackhawks game from November . I love NHL Gamecenter . =) 
Havlat is a free agent . ='( 
DID THE HAWKS JUST GET < PROPFEMALE > HOSSA ?!!?!?!? HOLY FUCK !!! HOLY FUCK !!! 
WE GOT < PROPFEMALE > HOSSA LONG TERM !!! WE GOT < PROPFEMALE > HOSSA !!! OMFG !!!! OMFG !!!!!!!!! AHHHHHHH !!!!! I'M DYING !!!!

is in awe of how amazing the MLB.com At-Bat App is . This is incredible ! 
is feelin ' down about stuff . 
is watching Brewers/Dodgers ... then Padres/Giants . I wish I had a life . 
is so proud of my good friend , < PROPFIRST > . 
just finished six < PROPMALE > of running . The real torture was listening to < PROPMALE > Farmer and < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > calling the White Sox game . Good GOD . If only all of Chicago's sports announcers were as good as they were in the Bay Area . 
.. questions of science , science and progress . Do not speak as loud as my heart . 
is so bored . =( 
.. \doesn't mean I didn't get what I deserved . No better and no worse . \"" 
my second favorite game of the playoffs is on NHL Network , tonight . Game 1 between the Blackhawks and Flames . The DVR has some work to do , tonight . =) 
< PROPFIRST > Tallon was fired ! Wow ! < PROPMALE > Bowman is the new GM of the Chicago Blackhawks . 
Anyone wanna see < PROPMALE > Potter , tonight ? I got bailed on by everyone else as usual . 
just asked < PROPFIRST > Havlat if he'd wear number 91 for the Minnesota Wild . I hope he does it !! 
is feeling very angry at < PROPFIRST > McDonaugh . And still wishing we kept Havlat . 
Do you ever look at old profile pictures and wonder how you ever thought those were good pictures of you ? 
I officially have the most inconsiderate sister in the universe . 
left the 80th avenue roller hockey rink just before the rain started pouring down . Great timing on our part . 
Creepy . My mom had a dream about her grandma . And every time my mom has seen her in a dream , someone close to her seems to die soon after . I'm scared . 
is about to fall asleep to the Giants game . =) 
77 days till the Blackhawks are back . =) 
so ..... 21 Guns is a .... REALLY good song . 
is down to three possible < PROPMALE > year decisions : either a transfer to Purdue , a transfer to University of Illinois , or staying put at < PROPFIRST > . It will be a tough year as far as decision making goes . 
I don't think I can workout today . My ankle hurts too much . ='( 
is feeling very frustrated with stuff . 
officially has the most amazing profile picture ever made . All the credit goes to < PROPFEMALE > Strepka ! 
would like to remind you to look at my amazing profile picture . =D 
feels so happy and doesn't even know why ! =) 
.. ' it's better to say too much , than never to say what you need to say . ' 
is so so happy . =) 
.. ' thought I ran into you down on the street , then it turned out to only be a dream . Now I wonder how whatsername has been . ' 
Rockband is so fun ! 
There's a lot of things that I'd like to say to you but I don't know how . I said maybe , you're gonna be the one that saves me ? 
And when the jets go up and out , will our hearts stay here ? 
wants to play Rockband again . I also wish I had more things to do than Facebook . 
worked out and ran five < PROPMALE > without my ankle hurting ! =) 
66 days until Blackhawks hockey ! 
But liquor doesn't exist in my world , no liquor doesn't exist in my world . 
Now I've learned a lesson I won't soon forget , so listen and you won't regret . Stay true to yourself , don't miss your < PROPMALE > . And you won't end up like the fool who ripped his pants . 
You know that I could use somebody . Someone like you , and all you know , and how you speak . 
But I'm good without ya . Yea , I'm good without you . Yeah , yeah , yeah ... this song makes me tear up . I'm a pus . Oh well ... falling asleep to music soon . 
is having difficulty believing the reports coming out about < PROPFIRST > Kane being arrested . 
< PROPFIRST > Kane really broke my heart . 
suddenly has an awkward obsession/man crush on Cristiano Ronaldo ... and < PROPFIRST > Messi , of course . But Cristiano Ronaldo is sooo cool . I wish I still had the Fox Soccer Channel . =( 
Maybe , you're gonna be the one that saves me ? 
And from the ballroom floor , we are in celebration . One good stretch before our hibernation . Our dreams assured , and we all ... we sleep well , sleep well . 
This may never start , we could fall apart ... and I'd be your memory . 
My hopes are so high , that your kiss might kill me . So won't you kill me ? So I die happy . 
I'll miss you , kiss you , give you my coat when you are cold . Need you , feed you , even let you hold the remote control ... 
I know the world's a broken bone , but melt your headaches - call it home . 
I've kept a top 50 favorite hockey players list since I was six . It is now time to begin a favorite soccer players list . The top five shall be ... 1 ) Messi 2 ) Ronaldo 3 ) Torres 4 ) Nistelrooy 5 ) Eto'o 
will be watching Dortmund vs Real Madrid on the 19th with my new online soccer TV deal I bought . I am excited . 
is looking freakishly Italian with the new Adidas/Fila wardrobe and white gold necklace . It's very funny . 
is gonna miss his best friend so much ... Gonna play the Fifa demo and mess around on Facebook for a while longer . =( 
\EVERYBODY ... LOVE ... EVERYBODY ! \ " - < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > " 
is cleaning the room and packing for school - and NOT watching the Real Madrid vs Dortmund replay cause my Paypal is being a JERK . 
pretty girl + Blackhawks jersey + Blackhawks \Bryce\ " hat = deathly combination . " 
Only * 30 * more days until Blackhawks hockey ! 
Is going to start going by an english variation of my last name , but can't decide on the spelling . Should I go with \Halladay\ " or \ " Holliday\ " ..? " 
My mom and her friends are all sitting downstairs debating why I don't have a girlfriend [ and some of their reasons are ridiculous ] and talking about how they think my sister got fat . WTF . WE CAN HEAR EVERYTHING . 
\Nice snag . \ " ... \ " Nice toss . \ " ... \ " Nice Abs ! \ " ... \ " THANKS . \"" 
is waiting for his sisters to get home so we can go out to eat ! I slept at like 12 last night and didn't wake up till 11 . Wonderful . =) 
It's not over till you're underground , it's not over before it's too late . This city's burnin ' , it's not my burden . It's not over before it's too late . 
went to Red Lobster , got full from the biscuits , and met an incredibly attractive waitress named < PROPFEMALE > ! 
is really , really , really , really sad . So I'm gonna go run all my sadness away . Ten < PROPMALE > . I'm gonna run ten < PROPMALE > . Am I crazy ? Yes . 
is watching the Bears game . And watching a replay of Arsenal vs Portsmouth later . What a life I lead . I can't wait to go back to school . 
I wanna go see Inglourious Basterds but I have no friends to see it with . So .... I'll just play FIFA . 
\At least we don't obsess over our favorite foods ! \"" 
And even if I could it'd all be gray , but your picture on my wall : it reminds me that it's not so bad , it's not so bad . 
Real Madrid is embarrassing Rosenborg . Benzema has two goals in the first half ! 
is very happy with his new profile picture . And already has six others as possibilities for whenever this one begins to bore me . =) 
< PROPFEMALE > on me , when you're not strong . And I'll be your friend . I'll help you < PROPFEMALE > on . 
is just too obsessed with FIFA at the moment . Too obsessed . 
Standing in line to see the show tonight , and there's a light on ... heavy glow . By the way , I tried to say I'd be there ... 
I just found out my single room at < PROPFIRST > is nearly the size of a double . How exciting ! 
=) 
Should I go to the East/Providence game and sit in the rain ? Or stay home ? Tough decision . 
is going to play a little Fifa 09 and then go to bed . Last day of summer tomorrow . =( 
Real Madrid season opener vs Deportivo La Coruna in LESS THAN AN HOUR !!! 
Manchester United vs Arsenal had an amazing second half . Now watching Real Madrid vs Deportivo Coruna !! 
Real Madrid wins the opener against Deportivo ... but they didn't look Godly . That's weird ! 
packing the car for move-in , running five < PROPMALE > , and spending the rest of the night with my mom and sisters before I leave tomorrow . 
is sitting in Cult&Civ class ... this is the first time my internet has worked . 
is happy because there are attractive girls on campus this year !! =) 
No class till 2 ! ... 18 days to Blackhawks hockey !!! 
My creative writing teacher is such a bitch . I'm being super judgmental saying that [ especially since she hasn't said anything to the class yet ] .. but just from looking at her from where I am now , I have a really bad feeling . 
is about to head out for Sports Broadcasting class . SIDE NOTE : My judgmental remark about my college writing teacher was awful . Only because it turned out that I was completely false and she actually seemed like a very sweet person . 
I'll need you , feed you .. even let ya hold the remote control . 
has a two and a half hour class , tonight ... but is officially going to the Blackhawks first preseason game on the 19th . =) 
feels like an outcast in this meteorology class . I'm like the only one here who isn't a pilot . 
hahaha .. the only one excited to see me when I got home today was my dog . I think this is the first time in my life I'd rather be at my dorm than home ! 
I may be ugly , but they sure ... love to stare . 
13 days till the Blackhawks opening preseason game vs . Washington . This countdown has been going for the entire summer and it's finally closing down ! 
is getting closer to choosing a favorite soccer team . Liverpool has great history , sick jerseys , my favorite player , and they aren't good right now . Which means I wouldn't be bandwagoning . They're the perfect choice ! 
is having lunch with the family , then heading back to school . Liverpool vs Burnley in 5 days . Capitals vs Blackhawks in 12 days . 
\But awym jus ' a wittle Mawnico . \"" 
I have a bad tendency to let the dumbest/smallest things get to me . 
I have a seriously bad crush on < PROPFEMALE > Steele . It's really , really bad . I watch SportsCenter now more to see her than I do the sports highlights . 
\Ah .. but we DO have cargo pants . \ " ... \ " But we TOLD HIM we DIDN'T . \"" 
has been watching Premier League soccer and college football all day . Unfortunately , I've also been laying in bed all day because of this insanely painful headache that just won't go away . 
< PROPFIRST > Peterson makes me want to cry . 
is still not over last night's Bears game . But at least the Hawks are playing on Saturday !! 
is playing soccer tonight ! Yay !! ... one more class to go . 
thinks < PROPFIRST > Lyons needs to get a life ! What a loser ! And that < PROPFIRST > Corazzi kid is such a dork , too ! And < PROPFEMALE > Howe is lammmme . And < PROPFEMALE > SUCKS , < PROPMALE > Kolanko . And < PROPFEMALE > Kapinus is unattractive ! 
hates knowing there's preseason hockey on and I can't watch it because of the awful internet at < PROPFIRST > . 
Liverpool vs West Ham tomorrow at 11:30 .... then . The countdown finally comes to an end . BLACKHAWKS VS CAPITALS !!!! And I will be there . Can't wait ! AGGHH !! This countdown has been going for over 150 days . And it is down to ONE DAY !!!! 
just had a bag of chips from Croatia . They were addicting ! 
Torres wins it . 3-2 Liverpool . Game over . AGH ! ... getting ready to leave for the Hawks game , now . =) 
< PROPMALE > Torres scored two to win for Liverpool , < PROPFIRST > Cutler and < PROPFIRST > Knox led the Bears to victory , and I went to the Blackhawks game on Saturday - all combining together to make a very enjoyable and memorable weekend . =) 
Facebook Chat will be the reason I fail this class . 
cannot wait until Saturday when < PROPMALE > Torres beats the crap out of the Hull City Tigers and leads the Reds to 3 points ! And also cannot wait to get out of this damn two hour class . 
used to love Canada . But over the past year or so , I've talked to about 20 or so different Canadians that made me realize they're all completely retarded . 
has deleted almost thirty people from my friends so far . God , there's way too many people I don't know on here . I knew there was no way someone as unsocial as me had 360 friends . 
has a plate of cheese and fruit that I am going to enjoy while watching NHL Network for the next two hours . =) 
' You'll Never Walk Alone ' 
is still living off the happiness from the 6-1 Liverpool victory today . Going to the Sox game , tonight . coughfernandotorreshadahattrickcough 
is looking forward to a four day week . Skipping class on Friday to go home and watch the BLACKHAWKS SEASON OPENER !!! 
I can't believe we actually lost to Fiorentina . That was the most aggravating game I've watched as a soccer fan so far . 
..... so um . I don't like studying . 
is FINALLY almost done studying . I studied from 12-4 AM last night and 9-NOW . UGGHH . HOCKEY SEASON STARTS TOMORROW , THOUGH !!!! 
Ahhh ... productive night of hockey watching . Oh , I'll say it now : my < PROPMALE > Cup winner for this season : The Calgary Flames . 
BLACKHAWKS IN TEN !!!!! Who CARES about the olympics ? It's much better for us that we didn't get them . ANYWAY . My official prediction for the Blackhawks this year : 94 points , 7th in the West . AH , I'M SO EXCITED !!!! 
Woooo ! Skipping class to watch the third period ! 
Well ... at least we got a point . =( 
got a 140/150 on my Cult & Civ test . The Blackhawks took 3 out of 4 points . Bears/Liverpool play tomorrow . And I have a whole night of hockey watching ahead of me . Ah ... I <3 life at the moment ! 
It's funny when someone calls but you love your ringtone so much that you let it ring as long as you can so you can hear the song ... and then end up missing the call . =) 
I'm the new cancer . Never looked better . You can't stand it . 
is worried about something and , therefore , cannot sleep . 
is so sick of my headache problems ... how have I lasted all these years getting headaches every single day ? 
Bolland is out of the line-up , tonight . That makes me really nervous ... this game is rather important to me because if we win , we take an early five point lead over Detroit in the division . No Bolland will make winning in Detroit a little more difficult . 
The team I chose to win the < PROPMALE > Cup this year ( Calgary ) has started 4-0 . This pleases me . 
Sooo , the FIFA 10 demo ? ... it's amazing . AMAZING !! 
HAWKS WIN !!! SO happy to see Huet finally do something positive . I was getting really sad seeing him getting beat up by this city . I'm so happy for him . And I'm SO HAPPY THAT WE WON !! AGGH !! 
< PROPFEMALE > Orlova has to be the most amazing women God ever gave this green earth . 
is flipping between the Sunday Night game and the Canucks/Stars game and getting ready to head back to THE U tomorrow . 
has had a headache for three days now and it won't go away . No Motrin or Tylenol or anything has gotten rid of this thing ! Agh !! 
I'm eating in class , and watching hockey in class . God , I don't know how I get such good grades . 
is watching out of town hockey games in preparation of watching the Blackhawks game . NHL Gamecenter <3 
Yayyy , Hawks goaltending ! My prediction of 94 points might be a stretch at this point . I NEVER laugh when the Hawks are losing . But Olli's goal just now was the most EMBARRASSING shit I've seen from this team in a long time . Normally , I'd be incredibly pissed . But this is just like a really bad joke . 
is leaving THE U ( L ) after class to celebrate my mom and sister's birthday . 
... like < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFEMALE > ! 
\HOW IS HE GOING TO LOOK AT HIS FATHER WHEN HE GETS HOME !? \"" 
<-- This guy is cool enough to watch hockey in class . AGAIN . ... well , attempting to , at least . 
UGGHH ... this night class needs to end soon ! My streaming video of the Blackhawks game is AWFUL in this damn classroom !! 
People suck . But the Blackhawks won . So no complaints for today . If they lost ... might be a different story right now . 
\And you still act like you're in freshman year . \ " What the hell is wrong with me ? My friends say I should act my age . What's my age again ? " 
I've turned into such an asshole since last year . I don't know why . 
FOUR STRAIGHT WINS . 5-1-1 ! YES ! 
The kid sitting next to me [ in class ] is being a creep and staring at all my Facebook conversations/messages behind his hoodie . He thinks I can't see but it's fairly obvious . CREEP . I hope he sees this . 
UGH .. my Liverpool [ Torres ] jersey is sitting in the mailroom at school and the MAILROOM IS CLOSED UNTIL MONDAY . BAH !! 
Yay . Liverpool hasn't won a game or even scored a goal in three games . We would lose off a goal where an opposing fan throws a giant ball in front of our net and causes the shot to deflect in . Premier League title hopes = dead . 
is really disappointed the Ravens couldn't pull out the win . We really needed a Vikings loss . 
just saw the most beautiful girl I've ever seen at < PROPFIRST > University . Oh my GOD . 
has been playing WAY too much video games today . I'm going for a 5 mile run to make myself feel less useless . 
Heyyyy , AFFFFrica . Still curious about this PUMA ! 
has to miss the Blackhawks game , tonight . So I'm recording it and turning my phone off so no one can text me and tell me the score . And so ESPN doesn't try updating me on the game . So if you can't get in contact with me later , now you know why . 
Get back ... Get back ... Get back to where you once belonged . 
has a crush on one of the Blackhawks ice crew girls . hahaha If only I had the game to hit on her ! 
Now that the Hawks have won , it's time to spend the rest of the night playing Beatles : Rockband and learning how to run a wildcat offense [ correctly ] in Madden . 
YAY ! THE LEAFS ARE FINALLY GOING TO WIN A GAME ! I'm so happy for them ! 
Women are stupid and I don't respect them ! 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > Persie , Andrei Arshavin , Cesc Fabregas and Arsenal are getting their ASSES HANDED TO THEM today by the likes of < PROPMALE > Torres , Yossi Benayoun , < PROPFIRST > Babel , and LIVERPOOL ! 
I need two things really bad right now : 1 ) The ability to go more than two days in a row without a headache . 2 ) The ability to sleep ... AT NIGHT . 
is going to attempt to sleep since I have to be up a 10 to watch the Liverpool game . 
loves how Facebook is always suggesting that I \reconnect\ " with < PROPFIRST > Ovechkin or < PROPFIRST > Sedin by writing on their walls or poking them . " 
If anyone knows someone who owns a business that would like to sponsor a < PROPFIRST > University hockey team ( ice hockey ) ... please let me know . 
And in the end , the love you take is equal to the love you make . 
I am SO SICK of being a Hawks fan . SO sick of this FREAKING crap . 
is playing in my first hockey game in over two months , tonight . I can't wait to see how I feel on the ice ! 
will be on the ice in just an hour ! AGH !! Can't wait !! 
is spending another night with NHL Gamecenter . =) 
3 in the morning . 3 mile run . In the books . Time to watch 3 in the morning TV with my good pal , < PROPFIRST > . 
... =*( 
is skipping night class to watch the Blackhawks game , tonight . And God , I want my hair to grow back really bad . 
Maxim Afinogenov : 6 G , 10 A , 16 P in 16 GP . AFINOGENOV #1 !!! 
The Blackhawks circus trip begins this Thursday ... oh , my best memories as a kid were from this circus trip . It was the only time my mom would consistenly let me stay up late since most of the games were at 9:00 or 9:30 . And it was the only time as a Hawks fan where you got a whole string of games in a row without being dogged by the \no home games\ " policy . I love the circus trip . " 
Happy Birthday , < PROPFIRST > Kane ! 
< PROPMALE > Huet : 10-4-1 , . 907 SV% , 2.17 GAA . Since most of you are relatively new to hockey/being a Blackhawks fan , I'll simply tell you ... those are really good < PROPFIRST > ! 
Liverpool vs Manchester City . NOW . 
is skipping class on Wednesday night . I will NOT allow it to get in the way of me seeing my favorite player make his debut with my team . < PROPFEMALE > HOSSA IN TWO DAYS !!! 
Our best all-around player and most skilled forward returns TOMORROW NIGHT . < PROPFEMALE > HOSSA in 27 HOURS !!! AGH !!! 
I'd like you all to know you shouldn't get your hopes up on a Kane-Toews-Hossa line . That'd put two RWs on one line and JQ would be throwing all his eggs into one baskett . Also , be scared - cause while we have Hossa back [ possibly-rumors he won't play ] the Sharks are getting Torrey < PROPFIRST > back , tonight . New York Times says this could be the game of the year . 
is happy because my hair is looking like it will be long again by Christmas . I will never listen to my parents , < PROPFIRST > Lyons , or Spenser < PROPFIRST > Wheeler when they tell me to cut it , again . Because I like my hair long and I don't care what you losers say . I'm more attractive than you , anyway . =D 
And the time will come when you see , we're all one , and life flows on within you and without you . 
For once , I want to be assigned a paper that actually interests me . Just once . Then maybe I can show them my true writing ability . College is ridiculous , sometimes . In the library . Working . 
YAY ! I'm done with my paper . Now I'm just going to watch hockey in the library . I kinda like this place . =) 
Blackhawks new third jerseys , tonight ? Yes , please . 
I was texting today when this incredibly cute girl walked up to me and told me she was so cold because of the weater outside . Needless to say , I was in shock that she was talking to me - so shocked , that when I opened my mouth to say something , nothing came out . She walked away . I am such a loser . 
My Blackhawks video is over 1000 views . I am happy with this ! 
just applied for an internship with the Boston Bruins . Wish me luck ! 
is going to be very mad if he doesn't get this communications internship with the Boston Bruins . 
Writing papers while you're sick is not fun . But I'm glad I have my laptop back to do it on ! 
R.I.P. < PROPFIRST > Lennon 
is in the library . And there are attractive white women everywhere . Hurrah ! 
This is seriously the < PROPFEMALE > age of being a fan of things on Facebook . There are so many amazing things to be a fan of ! 
As far as the week from hell goes , the worst is over . Thank you , God . 
The person above me is UGLY . And I HATE THEM ! 
I still don't get why < PROPMALE > Byfuglien decided to be Pavel Bure , last night . I'm still in complete shock . 
Found out today that there is a very good < PROPMALE > the Nashville Predators will be giving me a spring radio broadcasting internship . I haven't even officially applied ! They like my sample work I sent them . =) 
< PROPMALE > Tocchet is , was , and always has been a complete asshole . I hated him as a player , and now I hate him as a coach . Good thing we kicked into his ugly face , tonight . 
has decided that if I get the Preds internship , I am going to convince < PROPMALE > Trotz to let me warm up with the team before games . 
< PROPFIRST > Corazzi here , speaking on behalf of < PROPFIRST > Eid . \ I really think I should change my password \"" 
<3 Hockey <3 
brb beating shit outta mom 
< PROPFIRST > . I know you're on my Facebook , right now . 
< PROPFEMALE > Orlova is attractive . 
is glad < PROPFIRST > Corazzi has his Facebook back so he can stay off mine ! 
is feeling quite down . 
is so glad I finally have MLB Network . It makes me happy . 
98% of all Americans will die at some point in their lifetime ... TRUTH . For more information , visit www.truth.org . 
Well , I can't sleep . I've been lazy , lately . I've gained four pounds since August . And it's 5 AM . Sounds like a good time to get back into shape ! WORKOUT TIME . 
But as for me , I still remember how it was before . And I am holding back the tears no more . I love you . 
is still so incredibly frustrated by last night's game . I hate losing after dominating a team . I hate it . I HATE IT ! 
is unwinding from the Blackhawks game by watching MLB Network . 
Christmas is not going to be exciting again until I have kids . 
In the process of opening presents early [ I know , so ridiculous ] God showed his dismay to our family by having Dad sit on the remote and subsequently change the channel to On-Demand . Not only did it switch to On-Demand , but the exact buttons to move to a porn channel and BUY a porno were touched . As a result , we all , as a family , saw one woman's tongue in another women's vagina as my little sister opened her gift . 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas to everyone who celebrates it ! =) 
Afternoon hockey makes me happy . 
FUCK Nashville . GOOD FUCKING RIDDANCE . Thank GOD we don't have to see them again this fucking season . FUCK them . 
We're officially number one in the NHL . Chicago Blackhawks : 26-9-3 , 55 PTS . 
< PROPMALE > Toews makes Team Canada over < PROPMALE > Lecavalier ? Wow , that's rather shocking to me . < PROPMALE > Seabrook over < PROPFIRST > Bouwmeester ? Not as surprising , but still surprising . Yzerman made some interesting choices . 
That was the worst hockey game I've seen all season long . And that's saying a lot , cause I've seen some pretty bad ones . 
Now that the Calgary Flames have officially reached the half-way point of their year , I'd like to re-assert the affirmation I made prior to the start of the regular season . The Calgary Flames will walk away from this year's playoffs with the < PROPMALE > Cup held high over their heads for the first time since 1989 . I hope I'm wrong . 
I just received the greatest compliment I've ever gotten in my broadcasting career . That turned the day around quick . =) 
is watching the Bruins/Rangers , then the Kings/Sharks . Sleeping after . 
If we acquired Ilya Kovalchuk , I might accidentally hurt somebody as a result of my over-excitement . 
I hate waiting around for hockey to start . Why can't it just be on right now ? 
The World Juniors were incredible . The ending to that game was just astounding . USA 6 Canada 5 Final , O/T . 
will be enjoying pond hockey with good people in the morning . Good night . 
I woke up this morning and my Dad told me I look like < PROPFIRST > Flacco . I love < PROPFIRST > Flacco , but I don't know if I want to look like him . Second time someone has told me that in the past year . 
There is going to be a lot of shoveling to do in the morning . Getting ready to watch the Sharks game , then heading to bed . Incredibly tired from a long day of pond hockey . 
We're in Bahston to play Mahc Savahd and the Bruins , tonight . I can hahdly wait . 
I love my dog . There . I have succeeded in posting a status not involving hockey . 
? a taste of < PROPFEMALE > 
That loss brought a lot of wonderful memories back to life . I used to get scared headed into the final frame with a big lead , and I still do . I don't care how different the talent level is between now and then . We're the Blackhawks . It's what we do . 
Can't decide which bothered me more : A ) Watching a four goal lead evaporate in twenty minutes and losing in the shootout . B ) Outshooting Anaheim 42-12 and still managing to lose 3-1 . 
Even in confession , < PROPFIRST > McGwire is answering around all of < PROPMALE > Costas ' questions . That was the most half-assed confession I've ever listened to . 
I feel bad for the team that gets a #2 -3 seed and has to play the Detroit Red Wings in round one of the playoffs . On another note : I will be in class throughout the majority of the day . First day of classes for me . Oh , the fun . 
is incredibly tired . But I ate too much , today . So I'm going to do a quick four < PROPMALE > on the elliptical . Follow that up with a shower and then it's finally off to bed . The first day of the semester was wonderful , and it's going to be a good one for sure . 
sitting in an english garden ? waiting for the sun 
I hate everyone . 
Text ' HAITI ' to 90999 to donate $10 for relief efforts . 
Hey , we're outplaying the opposition and not losing ! This is a nice turn of events from our last time out versus Anaheim . Very nice . 
words are flowing out ? like endless rain into a paper cup 
Actually , I change my mind . I'm going to go with a final of Indianapolis vs New Orleans in the Super Bowl . 
This may be one of the greatest days of my life . 1 ) The Blackhawks won . 2 ) I got hit on by my incredibly attractive dermatologist . [ what was she thinking ? ] 3 ) The Nashville Predators radio play by play guy likes my work enough that he's forwarding it to their TV guy ! And 4 ) THE BLACKHAWKS WON . In the words of Ice Cube ; today certainly was a ' good day ' . 
missed an entire period of the Blackhawks game , today . My streak of not missing anything is over . =*( 
I've decided I'm going to play rat-hockey with the old guys on Friday mornings . Time to get hooked , slashed , hit , and verbally abused by a bunch of jealous old jerks that never made it anywhere in life . Can't wait !

Calgary Flames @ San < PROPFIRST > Sharks tonight . Great match-up . Always one of my favorites to watch . Very excited for this one ! 
has spent too much time on Facebook , today . 
There is a really attractive girl in my poetry class . REALLY attractive . 
Basketball Jones ? I got a Basketball Jones ? I got a Basketball Jones , oh baby ? o o-O O O-o -oooo // Oh , Space Jam . How I loved that movie . 
I had a dream last night that I told < PROPMALE > Gerbe he's short and that I'm a better hockey player than he is . Then I proceeded to bully and push him around . Only I would dream that .

Many times , I've been alone . And many times , I've cried . 
is going to go cry my butt to sleep . Feeling so down . 
sentimental thoughts are overwhelming me again ? as I stare through a lens of tears 
I love west-coast , late-night hockey . It has been the most relaxing , enjoyable part of my life for many years . Unfortunately , there is plenty of homework to finish before I can enjoy Hockey Night in Canada and the late-start in Vancouver . 
That's it . I'm deleting < PROPFIRST > Sedin from my Facebook friends . That game was the last straw for me . Our friendship [ although his account isn't actually his ] ... is over . If Henrik had one , I'd delete him , too ! 
got Xbox Live today ! Add me if you want to play NHL 10 , Madden 10 , or Fifa 10 ! ...... KA88NE 
The Super Bowl could not possibly top this . This is a game I'm probably not going to forget ! 
is boosting his confidence by beating up his sister in FIFA 10 . AND celebrating every goal ! 
The Jerry : Where the Stars Take the Field . 
questions of science , science and progress ? do not speak as loud as my heart 
feels bad for Oilers fans . =( 
I have to be one of the luckiest people in the world . I don't know how I ever complain about anything . Listening to my full-collection of Beatles albums [ illegally downloaded , of course ] and then finally heading to bed . 
is bringing back my poofy , messy , unkempt hair . Not that it wasn't already that , but it will intentionally look even worse than usual . 
I hurt my Dad's neck celebrating the goal . I feel bad . Thank you , God . 
all your life ? you were only waiting for this moment to arrive 
Happy Hockey Day in Canada ! One of my favorite days of the year ! 
Happy Birthday to my dog . AJ is 4 years old , today . =) 
The Flames minus < PROPFIRST > Phaneuf plus < PROPMALE > White , < PROPMALE > Stajan , < PROPMALE > Mayers , and Niklas Hagman = still my choice to win the < PROPMALE > Cup . 
Shortening my rant on Martz : we do not have the personnel to run offenses as complex as the ones he has been known to run in the past . 
Eid ... pressured . Rolls out right . Throws it deep ! Into the FRIEND-ZONE ! ..... * crowd cheers * ... TOUCHDOWN ! What a throw ! Eid's 14th friend-zone throw of the season ! 
she's not a girl who misses much ? do-do-do-do-do-do ... oh yeah . 
This game is depressing me . Handling two losses in a row isn't as easy as it was in the old days . But maybe we'll come back . Trying to be positive . 
does not feel like driving to < PROPFIRST > University . Would somebody like to come pick me up and chauffeur me there ? That would be great . Thanks . 
I don't want to see Kovalchuk in a Devils jersey . I DON'T WANT IT . 
is spending the night hangin ' with my good friend , Hockey . =) 
is having a very difficult time sleeping . Agh , I also can't stop thinking about that alluring moment between < PROPFIRST > Brees and his baby boy . It did evoke tearful emotions . It was , perhaps , my favorite part of the game . Watching < PROPMALE > Burns ' Baseball which will hopefully put me to sleep ! 
There's this sickening feeling of anxiety in the pit of my stomach . I would like for it to stop . Anyway , < PROPFIRST > Turco is not playing well . This is good ! 
I just want to play hockey all day and never worry about anything or anyone and what they think . All anxiety and stress and insecurities evaporate when I'm fortunate enough to get to play . When I die , there better be an afterlife involving hockey . Otherwise , I'm going to be really pissed . 
Arsenal vs Liverpool at 1:45 . Then off to < PROPFIRST > to deal with my daily bullshit . 
Cubs pitchers and catchers report in 6 days . Giants in 6 , as well . White Sox in 9 . I'm so excited . 
I would really like to take a nap . Napping is fun . I like napping . 
So ... in case you can't tell . I'm REALLY excited about the trade we made today . It was a steal . So I'm updating my status a fourth time to talk about it . =D 
Do not dare text me the score of the Blackhawks game , tonight . Or I will hate you forever . I am recording it . 
nobody said it was easy ? no one ever said it would be so hard ? i'm going back to the start 
I am very stupid . And by that , I mean I am not smart . 
is reading < PROPFIRST > Fleury's biography . He is a role model for all of us undersized players in the NHL . =) 
I wish I was good at hockey so I could play the game I love for a living and not be in college . =*( 
I was fortunate enough to have the greatest , most loving , fun to be around friends as a kid . And I slowly realize every day that no one can and no one ever will replace them . 
< PROPFIRST > KAnE = mY fUTUR3 HuSBANd lol omg <3 
< PROPFIRST > Fleury's book is just captivating . There is no other way to put it . I am addicted . 
Why don't curlers ever celebrate ? They have ice ! That can allow for some of the coolest celebrations ever . But no , curlers won't celebrate at all . No wonder no one watches their sport ! They're boring !

It is only 6 in the morning and I have already managed to : 1 ) Not study for my midterms . 2 ) Act like an idiot with two great friends . 3 ) Embarrass myself via Facebook wall post . 4 ) Be extremely nervous about the oncoming day . It feels like I'm a surfer laying nervously on my board , watching as a monstrous wave comes barreling towards me . It's a long-board that Tito carved for me with his bare hands , too ! 
has not slept for over 28 hours . I am incredibly tired and wish sleep was in my future . But it isn't! 
I have to watch The Wedding Singer . It makes me happy , brings back wonderful memories . =) 
Off to southern Indiana . Praying that my headache problems don't bite me in the butt on the long drive there ! 
is going to Chicago for a little league baseball coach's meeting soon . I'm excited . =) 
everything i'm not ? made me everything I am 
is so glad the NHL is finally back . I plan on watching at least a little from each of the 12 games on tap for tonight . =D 
Tune into Versus now to watch Sharks/Devils and listen to my favorite broadcaster that has been the biggest help/influence on my career to date . The man has done a lot for me . Sharks vs Devils , < PROPFIRST > Hahn doing the play-by-play . 
NHL Trade Deadline Day was another disappointment ... Oh well ! Listening to The Beatles and watching hockey highlights to compensate . Then reading .

sleepless long nights ? that is what my youth was for 
and the weather's so breezy ? man , why can't life always be this easy ? 
is waking up at 5:30 in the morning to go play rat hockey on a day that features a full day of classes . The hockey part will be a blast , the school with no sleep part will be awful . Oh well ! 
had a remarkably easy time adjusting to being back on the ice again , this morning . It was great being reminded of why being on the ice is the greatest feeling in the world . I just wish class would finish soon because I'm just incredibly tired . 
we live in a beautiful world ? yeah we do , yeah we do 
is lying there and staring at the ceiling , waiting for a sleepy feeling . 
is still feeling quite sick . Gonna do some napping to help rid myself of the bags under my eyes . I'm looking forward to it . =) 
If me and < PROPMALE > were hanging off a < PROPMALE > , and you can only save one of us , which one would you save !? 
is watching Cubs vs Sox on Comcast Sports Net . It's great to hear < PROPMALE > Kasper's voice again . :D 
I find such great , classy people everywhere I go . Why am I so lucky ? 
This is a team people expect to win the < PROPMALE > Cup ? A team that has guys going off for changes and hanging around center ice as the opposing team makes a quick break up the rink and wins the game with seconds left as a result of our complete lack of caring and effort ? Wow . This is the worst thing I've seen from this team . 
these days such a kind girl ? seems so hard to find 
is playing roller hockey with some friends today !! Does anyone else want to play ?? 
< PROPFEMALE > Kapinus is a gold-digger . Stay away from this one ! 
So I got this idea . Since I'm supposed to be awake early tomorrow morning , my thought is that if I sleep RIGHT NOW , I can actually feel ready for the day when i wake up ! Because sleeping now would mean I would be getting more sleep ! Why didn't I think of this earlier !? 
< PROPFIRST > University has been ranked #379 out of 500 colleges for ugliest student body [ women only ] . http://www1.studentsreview.com/perceptual_rankings/best_school.php3?rankid=102&d_ranking=Ugliest%20Girls 
there are many things that I ? would like to say to you , but I don't know how 
A transfer to U of I is on my mind again . 
I'm usually the one to avoid comments directed towards referees , but that was one of the most poorly called hockey games I've ever had the misfortune of witnessing . Regardless , we deserved to lose . < PROPMALE > Hiller was great , and we didn't finish our chances . Despite another missed call that led to an Anaheim goal at the end , we still had time to tie the game and prove why we're a top three team , and we didn't . 
in this friendly , friendly world ? with each day so full of joy ? why should any heart be lonely ? 
My sister told me she wanted to wash my hair with a \special product\ " [ which I let her do ] ... my hair is now < PROPFEMALE > chestnut brown . " 
come . break . me . down . ? bury me , bury me . I am finished with you . 
Happy Birthday to < PROPMALE > Costas ! 
Bad day ... but it's okay , the Blackhawks won . Finally time to sleep . 
is buying MLB 2k10 today . Going to watch an episode of Community with < PROPFIRST > before heading off to the worst university in the world ! Woohoo ! 
can't stop watching classic games on NHL Gamecenter ! 
My Easter Break starts tonight ... which means I will be watching hockey for hours on end ... starting tonight . 
That game has me verrrrrrry down . 
On this day , in 1971 -- my childhood hero was born . Pavel Bure is 39 , today . His career ended so early . No player that great should have his career ended so early . Thanks for the memories , Pavel . =*( 
Calgary @ Colorado on Friday . My Flames prediction is STILL ALIVE . 
but if this ever changin ' world in which we live in ? makes you give in and cry ... say live and let die . 
Flames win ! Flames win ! Tied for the eighth spot with Colorado !! 
I feel my worn hands ? are empty waiting for God's new plans 
run away , run away ? i'll attack 
getting ready to watch Yankees @ Red Sox . OPENING NIGHT ! :D 
The Yankees are sitting dead last in the < PROPMALE > East ! Who woulda thunk it !? 
Baseball is stuck in the 1910s . Replay needs to be used in situations like that , but instead ... a dropped ball becomes a catch and then a double-play in the process . That's just so wrong . 
Butler sucks ! They're not even good at basketball ! 
Life is a constant game of falling short . 
Well , it's official . I have proven my lack of intelligence even in a matter that is supposed to be one of the main staples in my life . I am ... a MORONIC hockey fan . Thank the 2009-2010 Calgary Flames for proving it . 
White Men Can't Jump . 
< PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > is certainly not my lover . She is simply a girl who makes the outrageous claim that I am ' the one ' . 
will be investing in a San < PROPFIRST > Giants authentic on-field cap so that I can finally replace the three \RBK\ " hats I've become known for . " 
will be in attendance at tonight's Twins @ White Sox game . I'm looking forward to it . The Blackhawks game is set for recording , so NO TEXTS claiming the score is 8-0 Colorado and NO TEXTS with the actual score . Thank you ! 
For every one good person , there are a million assholes .

This Toronto crowd has been so good . I wish more baseball crowds were like this during the regular season ... 
doesn't want to go to Ethics class ... or Corporate Media . I'm not a fan of either class . 
Oh , take me back to the start . 
doesn't want to go to sleep because I don't want to be alone with my thoughts . So I will watch classic hockey games instead . =) 
is watching the playoffs on both my television and computer . Oh , playoff time ... how I love you . 
Playoff watching will be easier tonight because there will only be a two and a half hour point where I'll be required to pay attention to two games at once ! Woohoo ! My 9:00 and on playoff watching will be easy . =) 
is so incredibly nervous and anxious . 
enjoyed watching my team lose by myself , in my basement , with no friends or family what-so-ever . Losing and being alone are common for me anyway . Screw everyone . Screw Nashville . Yay ! No more home-ice advantage ! What we worked for for 82 freakin ' games is already gone . 
I'm still not happy . 
is entering depression mode now . All my nightmares about the Blackhawks during the regular season are coming true . Their lack of caring didn't cost them in game two , but they paid for it tonight . Just like they did in game one . 
Life is not like a box of chocolates , it is like an assorted bag of vegetables . You don't really want ANY of it , but some of the vegetables are a little more bearable than the others . 
EASILY a top five moment in my entire life . That was the greatest event I've ever had the great fortune of being in attendance for . 
The Blackhawks winning was wonderful , but what made being in attendance at that game as incredible as it was involved something else . Every soul was elated , and for a brief few moments , I [ as well as everyone there ] got to experience an ideal world . Where everyone is happy and everyone loves everyone . I have never felt happiness like the happiness I felt today in my entire life . 
My voice is still gone ... it is still extremely painful to speak ! It was fun watching the playoffs all day knowing we won . I am now watching the highlights of the game for the 30th time . :D 
My voice is fully recovered after Saturday's Blackhawks game ! Finally ! 
I don't think we're going to beat Vancouver . =( 
Oh , online classes . How easy you are ... 
< PROPFIRST > University is the opposite of a good school ! 
will be in attendance at every Blackhawks second round playoff game [ only the home games ] . 
My mom's playoff bracket is a perfect 8/8 . As opposed to my 5/8 with the Washington loss . hahahaha Completely worth it , though . < PROPMALE > HABITANTS #1 ! 
I'm looking for my son . Where is my son !? 
I want to wear my Canucks jersey to the United Center tomorrow and confuse the crap out of everyone when I cheer for the Blackhawks . 
I miss the illegal dish my dad bought to watch hockey games back in ' 97 . It ruined our backyard but it allowed us to watch every out-of-market game there was . Oh , the memories . =*( 
Okay ... I've decided : Blackhawks win in seven . I think Chicago is under Vancouver's skin . That is the official prediction for me . 
can't get by how eerily similar < PROPFIRST > Pavelski looks to < PROPFIRST > Versteeg . Too bad Versteeg is no where near Pavelski as far as hockey sense goes . 
I want to be that guy and buy a white tux to sport at my cousin's wedding three weeks from now . Good idea ? 
The playoffs have taken a heavy toll on my blood pressure and well being ... I can sleep relaxed , tonight . Thank goodness . 
RIP < PROPMALE > Harwell 
Hurray , my favorite sports team ! Way to out-duel the competition ! Victory is ours ! 
is the opposite of sad right now ! 
Okay . < PROPFIRST > Strasburg ... is a FREAK . I have a feeling he's going to be one of the greatest pitchers baseball has seen in a very long time , and VERY soon . However , he will still never take < PROPMALE>'s spot in my heart . 
finally bought the San < PROPFIRST > Giants hat I've been dying to acquire for months ! I can't decide whether to curve the < PROPMALE > or not ... 
is finally going to start running outside again . I'm so excited ! 3-4 < PROPMALE > to begin , hopefully up to 6-8 a couple weeks from now . Running + Baseball in Earphones = Extravagent . 
All this emotion , and yet we are only halfway there . The 12 hour rule is in effect . Smiles must be wiped off everyone's faces by 11:00 AM tomorrow . 
is making a sandwich and watching a movie to celebrate the half-way < PROPFIRST > of the Blackhawks journey . :D 
now somewhere in the black mining hills of < PROPFEMALE > ? there lived a young boy named < PROPMALE > Raccoon 
For the first time in my life , I am not nervous or anxious before a Blackhawks playoff game . 
tehehehehehehe :D 
is having trouble sleeping . I'm still too excited/happy about the game one win . =) 
< PROPFIRST > Tallon is now the general manager of the Florida Panthers . haha I don't know why , but this is extremely funny to me . 
? the quiet things that no one ever knows 
To my future wife , employers , or fortunes of money that may be thrown my way : should the Blackhawks win the < PROPMALE > Cup this year , NOTHING [ whether it be the day I met future wife , was hired for a dream job , etc ] will EVER surpass that moment in being the greatest moment of my entire life . SIX MORE WINS . I am the happiest I've ever been . 
LAST ONE OUT OF THE UNITED CENTER . ELATION . 5 MORE !!!!!!!! 
I'M SO FREAKING HAPPY . I'M NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO SLEEP TONIGHT !! AHAHAHGHGHGHGHH !!!!!! HAHAHAHAHAHAH !!!!!!!!!! 
has tried , and failed to fall asleep . I have lost the battle to the excitment of being up three games to nothing ! I AM JUST TOO HAPPY TO GO TO SLEEP ! So I will not . NHL 10 instead . :D 
AFGGHMGGGJFINIGDTBCUDUCJGRUSHCFHVJGHHJJJJJJJKKKKKKKGGJJJ !!!!!!!!! WERE GOING TO THE FINALS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
I cried for hours when the White Sox won the World Series , and I have never cared even HALF as much for them as I do the Blackhawks . I took several laps around the house after today's win , but no tears . There will be crying if we are to win it . I am so happy . SOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOOSOSOSOSOS HAPPY . AHHH !!!! 
Psssstt ... * whispers * ... HEY ! ... The Blackhawks won the Western Conference today ! We get to play in the < PROPMALE > Cup Finals now ! BUT DON'T TELL ANYBODY . 
My Blackhawks have robbed me of yet another night of sleep . It's okay , though . I don't mind . EVEN THOUGH I HAVE AN INTERNSHIP INTERVIEW TOMORROW . But no big deal . I'll just lay in bed and continue to think about what it would be like to win it all . We're going to the Finals . I know I've said it thirty times today but I can't stop thinking about it . =) 
The internship interview went very well . I'm relieved . Next on the day's agenda : our opening night roller hockey game !! 
Oh God , I can't wait to end this stupid \Cinderella\ " story . Screw Philadelphia . They don't deserve to share the same ice with us . " 
is currently updating my top 50 favorite NHL players list . It has been updated every six months since June of 1999 ... hahaha IT WILL NEVER END . 
if you ever enter my mind ? stay there -- you'll live 
is extremely nervous about the Flyers . I have a feeling the series will go seven games . 
Anxiety and impatience toward the arrival of game one combined with my fear of the Philadelphia Flyers is costing me sleep . Did we HAVE to be matched up with the under-achieving team that just recently got healthy ? Did we HAVE to be matched up with one of the only teams with just as many offensive weapons as we have ? Damn it , this is all your fault < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > Darschewski !! 
The nerves are at their worst today ... I'm dying for game one to begin . 
Woohoo ! I love having headache problems ! 8 headaches in 8 days ! This feels heavenly !! 
Today is the day . This is it . Game 1 . 
omgomgimgomg I'm so nervous . Heart is pounding . 
I'm happy beyond words . I've never smiled for so long that my face started getting tired , but it did . I'm still smiling anyway !!!! =) 
is not going to be able to sleep tonight ... TIME TO WATCH THE HIGHLIGHTS ANOTHER 50 TIMES . 
I don't feel like I deserve the Blackhawks to be in the Finals . Fans wait their whole lives for this and I'm experiencing it only 14 years into my fanhood . Oh well , I'll take it . :D ... soaking it in . I'm living the dream right now , which is why I probably can't sleep again . Reality is currently much better than anything my dreams my have to offer . :D 
just finished watching game one IN ITS ENTIRETY for the second time . It was almost as good the second time as it was the first . :D 
This is quite possibly one of the worst feelings I've ever felt . 
is reliving all < PROPMALE > Cup championship-celebrations I've witnessed in the past and getting awfully emotional in the process . We're so close ... 
Nothing like being woken up five minutes after a tearful goodbye to the night . I'm gonna be up for a while . 
i read the news today , oh boy ... ? 
is watching the Cubs game and completely avoiding NHL Network . It's still not helping get my mind off the game last night . 
Is this really happening ? 
I'm just SO happy . SO HAPPY . I can't believe we're a win away !!!!!!! AGGGGHHHHHH !!!! 
just saw ... the most RIDICULOUS , MESSED UP movie I've EVER seen . A horror movie that ended up being LITERALLY the funniest movie my eyes have EVER witnessed . If you have Comcast On-Demand , go to \Free Movies\ " and watch \ " Dead Alive\ " ... I can't even believe this movie was released to the public . I've never laughed so hard in my life . " 
is listening to a couple newly downloaded Phoenix albums . I just suddenly love this band . Out of no where . 
Tonight may be the greatest night of my entire life . 
has broken out the signed < PROPFIRST > Daze jersey in preparation for what may be the greatest day of my life . 
The clothing I have worn on this day will officially be retired and framed . I've said it a thousand times - this will forever be better than anything else that happens in my life . Crying in my mom's arms , sharing in all the elongated hugs -- all these feelings that are just indescribable . How fortunate , only 14 years into my fanhood . No sleep tonight , time to watch the game a second time . Followed by a third . 
has now watched game six a total of six times . And even more great news tonight ... Toews is on the cover of NHL 11 ! AND there are USER CELEBRATIONS in the game ! USER CELEBRATIONS ! I've been DYING for user celebrations my ENTIRE DAMN LIFE !!! 
The first jersey of an NHL defensemen I have ever bought ... my < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > jersey complete with the < PROPMALE > Cup Final patch is here . My official keepsake for the year that was ours . :D 
Coming from the kid with a profile picture of himself crying over the Blackhawks , it should come as no surprise that Toy Story 3 made me cry like a baby . God , this movie has followed me through every stage of life . They so did it on purpose . Go watch it , it's the best of the three but if you're emo like me ... beware . 
Ah , time to enjoy yet another NHL Awards Show . This time as a CHAMPION !!! My winners for this year : Masterton [ Kurtis Foster ] -- < PROPFIRST > Adams [ Dave Tippett ] -- Pearson ( or < PROPFIRST > ) [ Henrik Sedin ] -- Messier [ Shane Doan ] -- Selke [ Pavel Datsyuk ] -- Calder [ Jimmy Howard ] -- Vezina [ Ryan Miller ] -- Lady Byng [ Martin St. Louis ] -- < PROPMALE > [ Duncan Keith ] -- Hart [ Henrik Sedin ] 
Henrik Sedin wins the Hart Memorial Trophy . Thank GOD . It would have been a travesty if he did not . It would also have been a travesty if < PROPFIRST > Green won < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > . What a wonderful night to see < PROPMALE > win it , I'm so happy . 
is so excited for yet another NHL Draft , tonight . They seem to come and go so fast these days ... Revealing the full wish-list later . But I will say now that the player I want most that might drop to us is < PROPFIRST > Burmistrov . He'll be number one on my wish-list this year . 
Draft time !! My wishlist for this year : < PROPFIRST > Burmistrov , Nino Niederreiter , < PROPFIRST > Watson , < PROPMALE > Mcilrath , Stanislav Galiev , or < PROPMALE > Sheahan . #1 Pick Prediction : < PROPFIRST > Seguin . I think Florida takes Gudbranson . I also think < PROPFIRST > Connelly is going to drop off the board big time . Maybe as far as 10-15 . Fun fun fun !!! 
Draft Day leaves me feeling unsatisfied much more often than it does happy . But I guess I'm okay with < PROPFIRST > Hayes . I'm extremely pissed we passed up on < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > and < PROPMALE > Etem but ... whatever . We won the < PROPMALE > Cup . =) 
Well . We got by on two things : organization , and our name . The US is a talentless team that over-achieved , and the lack of class involved in the game of soccer is proven YET AGAIN . Zero finishers . No game changers . We have none . Ghana deserved to win this game , but the overtime and dives and SO MANY THINGS about this game need to be fixed and you know what ? They NEVER will be . 
... Now some other folks might be a little bit smarter than I am . Bigger and stronger , too . Oh , but none of them will ever love you the way I do . 
< PROPFIRST > Versteeg dealt to Toronto ... It hurts , but we got my 24th favorite player in return !!! VIKTOR STALBERG !! 
she eyes me like a pisces when i am weak ? i've been locked inside your heart shaped box for weeks . 
our daily compromise , it is ? written in your signed armistice 
Oh . My . God . < PROPFIRST > University is getting an ice hockey team . I get to play on a team that somewhat matters again . THRILLING . I've been freaking out all day . Suddenly , the school doesn't seem so bad anymore :) 
The Blackhawks won the < PROPMALE > Cup . :) 
Thanks for ruining the one month anniversary of our < PROPMALE > Cup win , < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > . Jerk . ... oh well , we got an ice slot for some hockey tonight and I can't wait . So that helps . BUT I'M STILL MAD AT YOU , < PROPMALE > . 
fold it , fold it , fold it , fold it -- ? 
Being a < PROPMALE > Torres fan was bittersweet , today . That's okay , though . He's my favorite player no matter what . EVEN if he's a jerk and leaves Liverpool . I will be rather hurt if he does . 
dreamt of our < PROPMALE > Cup banner being raised , last night . 71 days until our preseason opener in Winnipeg . :) 
officially has the most ridiculous voicemail greeting of alltime . 
Woohoo ! ' The Club ' premieres tonight at 8 on MLB Network . In case you haven't heard , it's a reality show that follows the White Sox front office from the beginning of the season on . Can't wait :D 
RAAHAHHHH LAATTAAARRWWAARRRAAAHH , RAWWRRR !!! - As I Lay Dying 
The < PROPMALE > Cup Champions DVD has left me smiling big . I wish they covered more pivotal points of the regular season , but it's still a great video . I will watch it a million times . :) 
Can we please have a baserunner , < PROPMALE > ? Please ? 
played hockey with a minor-league journeyman today . < PROPMALE > Galvin , he played for the Manitoba Moose this season . He's also had stints with the Grand Rapids Griffins and Providence Bruins . Seemed like a nice guy , he even tried to teach a couple of us how to perfect our saucer passes ! [ TRIED ] 
You and I have memories longer than the road that stretches out ahead . 
I'm getting braces ... how exciting . 
she's been buildin ' up a castle , and I ... ? roll the dice for me 
Niemi's arbitration hearing is today . God , this has been a nightmare of an offseason . 
It's MY MONEY , and I need it NOW ! 
It's so nice to see all these Blackhawks status ' in the middle of summer ! In my opinion , walking away from Niemi is the right move . $2.75 million is too much for a goalie that hasn't really proven anything yet . Plus , I actually think Turco might end up being an upgrade . He's one of the best stickhandling goalies in the game , too . That could end up being great for us , especially with our speedy transition game . 
likes how Discovery Channel is promoting ' Shark Week ' like it's sex . 
Down to just 50 days until the Blackhawks preseason begins ! 
Woohoo !! Pulling weeds !! 
My favorite hockey player signed to play in Russia for five years , today . I am very down . Very , very down . 
but liquor doesn't exist in my world ? no , liquor doesn't exist in my world 
officially has NFL on CBS ringtones set to be my tones for this fall . They sound so good ! 
Exciting day . Playing roller hockey and then spending the night with a couple good friends and Madden 11 . I'm excited . 
< PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > MEGAPLEX , 2010 INLINE HOCKEY CHAMPIONS ! WOO ! 
Yea , there's nothing left to prove . Cause I'm just trying to be a better version of me for you . 
is so incredibly excited for the Bears game , tonight . Not to mention ... only 40 days away from the Blackhawks first preseason game , too !!! 
* independent black woman singing voice * ... I'm nawt always thaaar when you CAWL ... buh-I'm AWLWAYS on TAYMME ... and I GAYYVE you my AWL ... now BAYBAY BE MAYNE . */independent black woman singing voice * 
YES . After applying for now over 30 jobs this entire summer , I finally got a call back for a job interview . FINALLY . 
< PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > is the greatest quarterback to ever grace the National Football League . ADMIT I'M RIGHT THIS INSTANT . 
Madden 11 ... I'm so addicted . All these twists and turns my franchise has seen make for an experience similar to that of a book that you just can't put down . From < PROPFIRST > Owens taking over as head coach of the Bears in 2012 [ apocalyptic sign ] to seeing the Steelers AGAIN beat the Cardinals on a last second touchdown drive in Super Bowl 46 , the pandemonium never ends . 
This would happen to me . I went to my job interview at Brunswick Zone , and was asked ONE normal question -- in response , I mentioned my love for hockey and found that the man interviewing me loves hockey , as well . My job interview ended up being an hour long conversation about hockey and I ended up getting offered a better job than the one I applied for . Thank you , hockey . :) 
I hope you don't care much for your legs , < PROPFIRST > . They won't be around for much longer ! 
bought some Cubs shirts which FOR SOME REASON were on sale , today ! ... I guess there are some benefits to being a losing team after all . 
no reply ... ? no reply ... 
Job interview . < PROPMALE>'s Sporting Goods . 12:30 pm ...... g3tTinG r3aDy <3 * ~ xox 
In all my years of playing hockey video games , NHL 10 to NHL 11 is the GREATEST improvement I've seen from ANY hockey game in a one-year-span . This game ... is just . WOW . NHL 2k2 to 2k3 was the previous best as far as improvement goes , and NHL 10 to NHL 11 just blows that record out of the water . 
ya just call on me , brotha ... when you need a hand ? we all need somebody to < PROPFEMALE > on 
11 days until NHL 11's release , 25 days until the NHL preseason begins , 26 days until the Blackhawks preseason opener in Winnipeg , 41 days until the NHL regular season begins -- including the Blackhawks season opener in Colorado . HOCKEY COME BACK , I LOVE YOU . YOU'RE MY LIFE . I'M A WRECK WITHOUT YOU . 
I just can't escape these daily headaches . Me and < PROPMALE > Harvin are so alike ! The headaches , the skin color , athletic ability , etc ! Right ? Am I right ?? 
Bears game was disappointing as usual . BUT ... Hearing < PROPMALE > on the Texans/Cowboys game + Hard Knocks made up for it . 
Back to the lamest excuse for a University ever , tomorrow . 
Yes ! I'm going to Packers @ Bears on Monday Night Football !!! 
THE < PROPFIRST > IS BACK . < PROPFIRST > II BEGINS IN MOMENTS . 
Spongebob , my arms ... they're FROZEN SOLID ! You're GOING TO HAVE TO CUT THEM OFF WITH A SAW ! - My favorite < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > quote . 
< PROPFIRST > Hockey meeting tonight ... something tell me that , like everything < PROPFIRST > , it's not going to be organized . Or fun ! For God's sake , I found out today that I have an online class RUN BY A TEACHER THAT DOESN'T EXIST . ONLY AT < PROPFIRST > . This school ... 
7 days in a row with a headache . I'm sick of headache issues . The pain won't go away :( 
is having a pop for the first time in forever . Sunkist ... you taste so good !!! 
is playing Eastside Hockey Manager in class . My 2017 Chicago Blackhawks are much more important than anything SCHOOL has to offer . Psh ! Side note : I think I'm approaching around 40 seasons played in this game over the past four years . Oh , the lack of life I have . 
is just two classes away from football season !!! 
Football ... finally !! Napping my way to game time . 
BLACKHAWKS ON TONIGHT !!! AGH !!! 
Hawks lose 6-3 ... I hate the < PROPFEMALE > Leafs . 
Oh , NFL Sundays ... how I love you . How I've missed you ... 
The life of a Bears fan ... 
I've been trying to convince myself that I'm happy about our win on Sunday , but I just can't . We shouldn't be 1-0 . :'( 
Exactly one more week to the Blackhawks !!! 
AGGGHHHHH HUGE WIN !!! SO HAPPY !!!! 
TIME TO WATCH THE JETS LOSE IN PEACE !!!! 
is once again seriously considering a transfer to Michigan State or U of I ... Only this time I'm much more serious about it . I'll be applying ( if possible ) this week ! 
Omg ... The Blackhawks are playing tomorrow . I've been counting down the days since June 12th and it's finally here . * drools * 
CLEAN YOUR ROOM , EAT YOUR CARROTS , COOK THE DOG !!! ... COOK YOUR OWN DOG !?!?! NO CHILD SHOULD BE made to do that ... 
I hate the Jets , I hated Braylon Edwards before today ( especially after his assholish taunting on Sunday ) , and after an Edwards drunk driving charge , I now hate both even more ! I'm just glad to see a difference maker on this team is in trouble . The Jets and their undeserved cockiness can go to hell . 
is watching preseason hockey ... oh , what a feeling . Blackhawks TOMORROW NIGHT . 
This is the most entertaining preseason game I've ever seen . 
It's a bittersweet symphony this life . Trying to make ends meet , you're a slave to the money , then you die . 
Watching hockey is a feeling that calms my life unlike any other activity I ever take part in . I'm so happy the preseason is here again . 
WHO DAT ? WHO DAT ? WHO DAT SAY DEY GON BEAT THEM FALCONS ? 
God , NFL Red Zone ... you're beautiful . Plus , you're so easy to watch when I don't have to worry about the Bears game ! 
I hope Braylon Edwards gets hit by a drunk driver . Go to hell , Jets . 
will be at the Bears game , tonight . Oh God , we haven't been a part of a regular season game this big or important in a very long time . I'm incredibly nervous . 
JUST OUT OF THE GAME !!!! WE'RE 3-0 !!!! WE'RE 3 AND FUCKING 0 !!!!! ON TOP OF THE WORLD !!! YES !!!! GREATEST NIGHT SINCE JUNE 9TH !!!!!!!! 
We're 3-0 and 29 other teams are not 3-0 :D 
But I'll be so close behind , I'll follow you into the dark . 
If you miss a day without your friend , your whole life's off track . 
Monday Night Football followed by my hockey game at 10 o'clock . It shall be a good night ! 
Oh my God ... I have a gray hair . Already . I'm 20 !!! 
* Turns Mic On * ... upon further review , the replay showed that the gray hair only appeared so ... because it was sticking out and the light reflecting on it made it seem so . Therefore , the hair is deemed NOT gray * crowd cheers * and the ball will be placed at the Eid 20 . The Eids will not be charged with a timeout . Replay ... 1st down . 
I like it with lettuce ! 
Our NHL Center Ice package is all ordered and ready for the sixth year in a row . Oh God , I can't wait for tomorrow . Hockey practice tonight , oh the fun ! 
My predictions for the NHL season . Surprise teams : Edmonton , Colorado , < PROPFEMALE > , Toronto . West winner : Vancouver , East Winner : Pittsburgh ... < PROPMALE > Cup : Pittsburgh 
I am a living legend . With me , the playoffs are a certainty . 
That game was extremely setting in more ways than one , but after storming to my bedroom I flipped to the videos section of my iPhone and watched the only video available . Game 6 of the < PROPMALE > Cup Finals . Forwarded to the end , I feel better now . 
Don't worry , I won't be crying when our banners are raised tonight like I was when we actually won it , BUT I WILL BE VERY EMOTIONAL . Getting ready for a moment I've waited forever to see . 
At home with my fellow brethren at the United Center . 
mannn U GOTTA KNOW mannnn i ain't up in dis biiittch fah NUTHIN ' homie 
got over the Blackhawks game really fast tonight ! I think I'm finally becoming normal !!!

Oh , loneliness ... I'm sick of you . :( 
Thank Turco for that win . Another God AWFUL performance . Can't win a board battle , can't defend , can't make a first pass out of the zone , terrible penalty killing from everyone but the goalie , and a just a boatload of sloppy , boneheaded plays . Same thing as yesterday in < PROPMALE > . I can't believe this garbage . 
Doing my daily Facebook check in case I ever get a notification ... As usual , there are zero of those !!!! 
The Broncos are killing right now ! Go < PROPMALE > !!! 
I hate everything 
< PROPFIRST > Corazzi is the greatest human being I know .

This Avalanche @ Canucks game is the most entertaining hockey game I've seen so far this season . So beautiful !!! 
I hate the Saints ... and I hate the Jets more especially after they lost BECAUSE THEY KNEW I WAS ROOTING FOR THEM TO WIN TODAY .

Well ... time to watch hockey . Otherwise known as : my only friend . 
just made a new connection with the OHL ! Hurray ! I may end up not being a failure in life after all . 
While filming a Chicago Mission goalie for his WHL scouting video today , I noticed a player on his team with the last name ' Nylander ' , same as a former Blackhawk I used to love , < PROPFIRST > Nylander . HE WORE HIS NUMBER TOO . Looked into the crowd ... sure enough , < PROPFIRST > Nylander , bald head and all , sitting right there . His son was an amazing player ! 
The whitest of all the hursts starting at QB for the Seahawks on Sunday ! The beck was hassel'd too much !!

Oh , I bought one for < PROPFIRST > MONTHS ago ! It's nestled safely under our tree ! ... Nestled safely under our tree ... Nestled safely under our tree . 
Bears Victory Mondays ... the best Mondays . I wake up , spring out of bed , stretch , open the blinds , look out the window and think ... we're 6-3 . Yea , 6-3 . That makes me happy . :) 
< PROPFIRST > !! 
< PROPFEMALE > Collinsworth is like red wine ... he just gets better with age ! 
I have decided in the last week or so that < PROPFEMALE > Smith is a good coach ( not great ) and I do not want him fired . Only < PROPFIRST > . 
I dislike everyone and everything ! 
? oh , it's such a shame for us to part 
Has now seen every one of < PROPFIRST > Semin's 162 goals , all 49 goals of < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST>'s career , and 98/104 goals ( I think ) of Ales Hemsky's career . I can't choose which one is my new favorite player with < PROPMALE > gone . :( 
D . < PROPFEMALE > 99 yd . pass from < PROPFIRST > Eid ( R . Gould Kick ) ( 1-99 ) 
I hate the Jets . So much . I hate them I hate them I hate them . 
I spent so much of yesterday being angry about the Jets game that I ended up having a dream where < PROPFIRST > Sanchez and < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > tried throwing me a party to cheer me up . The party was great , but they are not forgiven . I'm still angry . 
I saw another Denzel movie tonight . It's just like EVERY Denzel movie I've ever seen . My goodnesss . 
Everything has more cons than pros ! 
I AM THANKFUL FOR NOTHING I AM BETTER THAN EVERYONE I AM A PERFECT HUMAN BEING 
Hope everyone has a terrible Thanksgiving ! 
Throwing mom's turkey in the oven now before I sleep . She's gonna be so happy to see it's fully cooked when we wake up eight hours from now !!!!!!!

Thanks , < PROPFIRST > Crawford ! So good to see you playing the way I've been hoping to see you play since we drafted you when I was 13 . < PROPFIRST > , I'm sorry ... but that whole thing about you rejuvenating your career here doesn't look like it's gonna happen . Tough break , nigga . There's always Fubu ! 
We'll never forget the way you thrilled the naaaaation , WITH YOUR T-FORMAAAATION !

I couldn't find any actual workers , so I threw in some random names of my own . Apparently .. < PROPMALE > Jauron , < PROPMALE > Childress , < PROPMALE > Phillips , and < PROPFIRST > Rudd all work for Total Hockey !

Still not over the previous game against Colorado ... hopefully tonight helps me move away from that one . Let's go my favorite sports team that I prioritize over almost everything ! 
< PROPFIRST > Rodgers ... you better not come out of no where to play tomorrow and find a way to beat the Patriots . If you do , I will probably have to kill myself so that I am no longer alive . Because that's what happens when you kill yourself , you don't live anymore . 
A SMART coach would call THIS play . 
Look , Mom -- STRAIGHT D's!! I PASSED !!!!!! 
Out celebrating straight D's with my mom ! We're getting ice cream !!!!!!!!!!!!

Lost another NFC Championship Game to the Packers ... in Madden . They make my life hell . 
KNOW your ROLE ... and SHUT your MOUTH ! 
I haven't been this upset at this team in a long time . I give up on them . Even if they make the playoffs . After that two on one at the end where ( of course ) Toews was the only player skating his heart out to get back ... I lost it . I completely lost it . I hate everything . GOD . 
Nothing good lasts . 
My phone is now cluttered with The Rock ringtones , text tones , and wall paper ! It's great ! Obsession scale back up to 10 !!! 
YES !!!!! HAWKS WIN !!! 
Made my Chicago radio debut today :) ... hopefully it wasn't the last time on air for me ! lolol ! 
Watching the Bulls game in class tonight ! 
Watching \The Cable Guy\ " ... looking a lot like what my future will be ! " 
OH MY GOD ' GOOD BURGER ' IS ON 
Just bought my tickets to see The Rock on wrestling . Redeeming 9-year-old-Charlie , who cried when he couldn't see The Rock at the very same building all those years ago . Finally , closure . 
Hawks playing with energy tonight !!! It's beautiful !! 
WIN WIN WIN WIN WIN WIN WIN YES YES YES YES THANK YOU < PROPFIRST > 
The Rock has legitimately broken my People's Heart . :*( 
The talk for the past few days has been all about Toews for MVP . And it's hard to argue against with all he's done , but my MVP is still Crawford . 
24 hour extension <3 
I love < PROPFIRST > Sheen . So much . 
I like going months and months into my Facebook wall's past . It's like looking back into an old yearbook . 
My Liam Neeson impression is coming along very nicely ... it should be ready within the next 6 months . 
If my broadcasting career fails , I'm taking up acting and wrestling . lololol ! 
ST . < PROPFIRST > STOPPED HIMSELF AND MOVED THE PUCK BACKWARD . WHAT THE HELL . I'M SO SICK OF THIS CRAP . HOW is that a good goal !? HOW ?!? JESUS . 
Going to < PROPFIRST > in half an hour . Somebody kill me please . 
Since Nicklas Backstrom went out to injury on March 7th , the youngest player on my top ten list since < PROPFIRST > Semin ( < PROPMALE > Johansson ) has 2 goals and 3 assists as part of his 4 game point streak . THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN < PROPMALE > GETS PLAYING TIME . #90 FTW . 
I've made a fool of myself in all three of my classes today . Feels great :D 
Watching the Blackhawks game in class on the GREATEST QUALITY I have ever seen from an atdhenet.tv feed . OM NOM NOM . 
For you I'd bleed myself dry 
Back on the ice for the first time in months tonight . This should be funny ! 
It's even better when it's with ice cream . Know what I mean ? PEACHES N CREAM . ( ... I hate growing up and realizing what songs I listened to when i was 10 really meant . ) 
YES !!!! THANK GOD !!!! HUGE WIN !! THANK YOU AGAIN < PROPFIRST > ! THERE IS YOUR MVP ! 
The Char says ... Geez , today was a long day ! The Char is glad it's over .
