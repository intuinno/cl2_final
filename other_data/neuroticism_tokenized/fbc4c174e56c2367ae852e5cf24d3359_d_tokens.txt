\There's a kind of a sort of cost . There's a couple of things get lost . There are bridges you cross you didn't know you crossed until you cross . \"" 
\You need that boy like a bowling ball dropped on your head ... Which means not at all . \"" 
is no longer drowning ... but is exponentially more confused ... 
And when I hit the coast , I hope you'll think of me , and how i'm stuck there with the ghost of what we used to be . 
doesn't understand how people decide to get a second tattoo after the first one . Is dying . And is going to bed .

Here's a toast to all those who hear me all too well . Here's to the nights we felt ALIVE . Hoping tonight will be as perfect as today was !

Wanna stay , not to go , I wanna Ditch the Logical ... Here's to the tears you knew you'd cry . Here's to Goodbye , tomorrow's gonna come too soon . 
just loves playing go-between . Fml . Taking a nap . 
Try to remember the kind of September when grass was green and grain was yellow . <3 
is wondering why i came back ... 
thinks that < PROPFIRST > Fogarty smells amazing . :) 
thinks that it's hilarious that < PROPFIRST > Fogarty actually owns a snuggie . 
< PROPFIRST > Fogarty broke my car ! I'm probably going to kill him . 
feels like i'm dying , but had a great night . :) :) <3 
apparently has a broken cell phone ... 
fiishing Bio paper . Then writing psych paper . Then studying for psych exam . Kill me , please ? 
\It is part of the job of being a child to act in ways that lead to trouble in order to determine the limits of the social and physical world . \"" 
made it through the all nighter thanks to five hour energy shots and a wonderful all night companion . :) Sleeeeeeeeep . Forever preferably . 
Why aren't we watching scary movies in your school house right now ? With < PROPFIRST > Sisto making comments about the people getting killed and < PROPMALE > Gates making comments about the people having sex and you making comments about < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Secrest and I and < PROPFIRST > Deike talking with authority about something he knows nothing about ... - < PROPFIRST > Harrington

Note to self : Flipflops at 8 oclock on a December morning = bad idea .

Laundry , shower , packing . Back to Ship this evening * sadface * . 
is sick of the negativity and is trying to focus on the positive . Sooo excited to see my < PROPMALE > Gates tomorrow !! 
really needs to learn to focus . Of course , it would help if i cared about the Chinese immigration o < PROPFEMALE > at ALL . 
really doesn't think that every teacher associated with Huntingdon County needs a fan club . 
finds it annoying that my COLLEGE advisor uses 4 dots in her ellipses when she emails me ... 
Dear snow , You make campus very pretty while i'm safe inside my dormroom . But if you're still here tomorrow , you will ruin my day . Please keep that in mind while you decide how long you'd like to stick around . Thanks . 
I don't normally do these but ... if your Dad is your hero , whether you are blessed to have your Dad still with you , or if he has gone to be with the Lord , copy and paste this with his name : < PROPFIRST > McCarty 
had a brilliant time traveling through Narnia with the Storklings . : ) 
agrees with the statement that ignorance is bliss . I was probably better of not knowing . Very distressed . Hopefully i'll sleep soon . 
|Can we get back to the point in this conversation where we saw things through each other's eyes , ' cause now all I see is ruin and devastation . We all need somplace we can hide inside . After all ... we're only human . 
You found a place between the lines of yesterday , I could not hide . We can make it , if we only try . We can make it . <3 
Happy Valentines day , < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > . <3 <3 <3 
Note to self : Hairbrush and keys are not the same thing . One gets you into a locked dorm room and the other is just awkward to be carrying when you go find an R.A. to let you in . Oh , today will be a great day ... 
When memories fade , we've got each other . When time and confusion collide , I hold it all when I hold you . <3 
is finally going to give this stupid speech and get it over with ... Can't wait until this day is over , because after today it's all simple until spring break ! 
Sleep . Class , Class , Class , Work , then leeeaving ! So excited . 
was too nervous/excited to sleep ... Wants this busy day to pass quickly . I'll be on my way in less than nine hours ! 
Made it safely . : ) 
had a great time in Baltimore meeting < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE>'s family . They're awesome people . Now class for three days before taking him home to meet mine . 
had a great afternoon enjoying lunch , < PROPFEMALE > bucks , and the gorgeous weather with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Carbaugh and < PROPFIRST > Geckle . 
Does not want to spend two hours inside at choir rehearsal on this beautiful day . But is enjoying spending the day with Sweetface . Home tonight . 
If you have a wonderful husband , fiance , or boyfriend that works hard to take care of you and would do anything for you , then repost this as your status to give the honest good men out there the recognition that they deserve . Because great men are few and far between and I have one of them ! i ? < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > 
needs to stop stalling and finish packing . Choir tour this weekend . 
loves the warm , fuzzy feeling of putting on pajamas after spending hours in a dress . : ) Hairspray was a blast . 
In a world full of shadows , broken promises , and dreams , when it seems the world is hopeless , a light will be there . Like a < PROPFEMALE > above the ocean , like a candle in the dark , like a dream set in motion , a light will be there . 
finds it kinda funny and verrry sad that Shippensburg has a vending machine to dispense the Plan B pill . They're all about that pregnancy prevention . 
asks all of you to excuse my silly boyfriend , < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > , who seems to have decided that he wants to be everywhere that I am and is tagging himself in all of my pictures . 
Take your tears , put ' em on ice , ' cause I swear I'll burn the city down to show you the light . 
It's another beautiful day ! Group meeting , Dinner with < PROPFIRST > Geckle , enjoying the weather and then taking a walk this evening . : ) 
Dear loud , black woman sitting in the table next to me , I don't care whether your grandmother has caller ID or not . Please stop talking about it so loudly so that I can continue writing the paper I've been working on all evening . Thanks . 
Excuse me , Loud girl at the table next to me , I don't care about your sexual escapades . Please stop yelling about them . This is the library , and I'm trying to write another paper . Thanks . 
Dear Sexual-Escapade-Girl , Earth Day is not the Earth's birthday . That doesn't even begin to make sense . It's people like you that make me hate Shippensburg . 
is enjoying a fun day in Baltimore with < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > Aquandria < PROPMALE > . Bringing sweetface back to Ship tonight . Packing and leaving after last final tomorrow . 
GAGA <3 
is having trouble grasping the concept of conditional love ... but it seems to be becoming more and more prevalent in my life ... 
wonders why four adults decide to bring six small children to a restaurant ... i see a disaster coming ... 
Can i charge my phone in your computer port ? 
just put in about a billion job applications and is now exhausted . sleeeeptime . 
kyaking with the family since i won't get much of a < PROPMALE > to do stuff like this after thursday . : ) 
well , it's been a long day ... but we have an adorable apartment and are about halfway moved in ... sleep time now . up early . 
sigh ... end of day two . everything is moved in ... now it's just a matter of getting settled . this is all even harder than i thought ... 
Dad : \Holy burning balls it's hot out here . \ " ... wonderful . " 
... and thus begins the first day of forever . 
what is it about this time of day that makes me want to go to bed and hide under the covers ...? 
misses the Huntingdon stars . There arent enough here ... 
power's out ... so what will we do now ? 
hours and hours of searching craigslist actually paid off and landed me an amazing job . sooo excited . 
working in insurance is pretty much the best job ever . Not only do we get paid very well to sit in a very comfy desk chair and make phone calls but vendors bring gifts to get us to refer business to them . Cinnabon cup cakes and a huge fruit tray . We are happy today . : ) 
thinks it's cute that < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > locks me in when he leaves so that no one can get me . : ) . Off to work . Have a great day , everyone . 
has a migraine . what a wonderful end to a completely awful day . trying to sleep , i guess . 
Sometimes I just wanna copy someone else's status , word for word , and see if they'll notice . 
Every so often we long to steal to the land of what might have been , but that doesn't soften the ache we feel when reality sets back in . 
Karilyn Burney : Do you remember all of the times we went to the beach and you got super burnt and I didn't ? Do you remember how I laughed at you and made fun of you ? I take it all back . 
Ugh . Watching \The Bounty Hunter\ " was pretty much the most boring two hours of my life . Terrible movie . " 
should know better than to expect any different than this by now ... but it gets me every time . 
getting my dog on Wednesday and needs name suggestions . 
my insurance lisencing instuctor speaks English with the same eloquence as the astute Mr. < PROPMALE > Waleski . 
now has a dog named Cooper . And I love him . 
probably has the most precious dog in the world . 
is super mad that we decided not to get cable and now I can't watch Glee tonight . : ( 
Play the music low , and sway to the rhythm of love . 
... it has been a very interesting few days ... Now I'm ready to sleep for the rest of my life . 
gave the baby his first bath today ... i'm pretty sure i got more wet than he did ... 
I like kittens ! 
Put\ 
this as your status if someone you knew was killed by Lord Voldemort . \ 
As everyone knows , being killed by Avada Kedavra , having your soul \ 
sucked out by a dementor , or getting petrified by a basilisk is a truly \ 
tragic fate for anyone , muggle or wizard . 93% of people won't copy and \ 
...... paste this . Will you make this your status to spread awareness of \ 
this growing threat ? 
It's strange to me that it's been a year , because it seems like it's been so much longer and so much shorter at the same time . Happy Anniversary , < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > . I love you . 
< PROPMALE > Potter at midnight tonight . I'm super excited !! 
Ugh . Long drive , but I made it back to < PROPFEMALE > ! 
It seems that , in my absence , my mother has taken to meticulously decorating our house . It's starting to look like a picture out of a log homes magazine , which is the perfect place to spend Thanksgiving . 
Got a new sweater today . I am very warm . : ) 
My bear loves the snow . : ) 
hopes the family has fun at the McCarty Christmas party tonight . Love and miss you all . <3 
\Kittens : An American Tradition \"-- Karilyn's TShirt . " 
< PROPMALE > is the best man in the world , hands down . I envy his passionate love for me and unparalleled intellect . 
I'd just like to let all of my Northern friends know that it was in the sixties here today and is going to be seventies by wednesday . I love this city . 
70 degrees and < PROPFEMALE > today . beautiful .
