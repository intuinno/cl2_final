So had fun today on a field trip with Viccile and < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > .. Started off rough but got better and better and thanks to < PROPFEMALE > I owed < PROPFEMALE > 2 dollars 

So just found out if don't get it together in math I'll fail ... Gotta get focused so I can basically pass with a low \C\ " gotta get ready for that math EOCT .. Anybody wanna help me with my math ?? " 
So I just found out that if you leave out a juice bottle with juice for about a month minute maid mixed < PROPFIRST > to be exact ( which < PROPFEMALE > Rashan < PROPMALE > gave me ) it becomes carbonated and tastes lik wine ..!!! Lol Viccille Alobwede laughed at me but she wish she had some !! 
Had a hilarious time with Bryana Jennings and Jlysa < PROPFEMALE > Robinson at the movies !! Hey Jlysa do you feel a strangling coming on cause I do .. lmao I missed my best < PROPMALE > .. Hmmm well now I'm chillin at home enjoying spending time with this very special person .. I wonder what the rest of this day ha in store 
So is your love for this person worth the tears , the stress , the agony and pain ? How can you love someone but be so alone .. Is it really love or are you in love ? Or maybe it's just infatuation .. People who are in love fight curse each other and just no longer care but true love is what's left after being in love has burned away .. Maybe that hits home with someone ? 
So I swear everyone at Stephenson high school swears their in love .. Lik real talk I believe them cause none of them kno what real love is .. Lik I understand tryin to work through problems but come on once a person stops caring love is no longer in the picture .. I don't think anyone could show me a relationship of what true love looks like 
So talkin to this uncle of mine .. He's such a great guy with a huge heart !! I love him < PROPFEMALE > much 
Going to be hangin with my aunt this weekend ... also with my uncle and < PROPFIRST > rogers tonight should be fun .. can't wait 
Been talking to the newest friend < PROPFEMALE > La-sha Unpredictable all day ... life is so crazy ... Funny how getting close to one shows many others true colors ... Hanging with her and < PROPFIRST > McGee and others for our birthdays May 13 & 19 .. I think this friend is a keeper :-)))) 
Gonna have an interesting day tomorrow .. I wish life didn't have downs but then th rollercoaster wouldn't be fun !!! GoodNight !! 
So i'm noticing there's nothing you can do about drama ... all my close friends seem to deal with it ... funny funny ... kinda enjoyin my life right now though ... if only my family life was ok .. well hey if mother wants to yell for no reason i guess i'll let her drain her vocals cause i dont give a FUCK !!!! 
Enjoyin my peace ... i've had much time to think over what my uncle said , what i know , and about this book ... I finally got all my thoughts together on issue thats hitting real close to home ... So are ya ready for my thoughts to blow you away < PROPFEMALE > La-sha Unpredictable cause i'm ready .. 
So I have a new sister and her name is < PROPFEMALE > Rashan Harris .. hmmm she said its cuz were always fighting ( which is true ) but i think its also cause we'll tell each other anything ... hmmm i even got to school at 6:45 AM just for her ... but it waas so worth it !! 
So can someone at SHS tell me why girls be startin stupid drama over some dude ... well watever you wanna talk shit step up and try to fight her cause i got my sis < PROPFEMALE > Rashan < PROPMALE > back ... man < PROPFEMALE > QuestionLink < PROPMALE > you better tell thewm how i am !!! 
AP Test this morning kinda anxious and very nervous but all i can do is my best .. Wish Me Luck !!! 
So i'm officialy gonna tell < PROPFIRST > Jatan to keep his hands off my little sister < PROPFEMALE > Rashan < PROPMALE > or i just might have to beat you up . Cause my sis can't be dating an ignornant nigga lmao !! 
Had a great time with my sis < PROPFEMALE > Rashan < PROPMALE > the movie was long but kinda interesting ... i kept my eyes on the movie most of the time unlike my sis lol ... she just couldnt help herself could she < PROPFIRST > Jatan ? 
You only get a handful of real friends in this world so don't lose them because of your shortcomings ... 
Moving on Saturday .. Parkview School District .. Gwinnett County .. Hmmm kinda excited but then again i'm not ... 
At < PROPFIRST > Jatan's house for his birthday .. Just chillin 
Ok wow my old school ( Stephenson ) is playing football against my new school ( Parkview ) and everybody like stephenson gonna win ... man stephenson sucks !! 
Man I love my sister !!!! She's AMAZING !!!! I love her so much !! :-) 
What the hell ??? Why is someone freaking callin me constantly on a private number ??? Lik WTF ??? 
Smdh !!... Females and all there damn emotions ! 
So screwing up sucks ! Guess I'll find out how life is without you for a few more days ... Hopefully :-( 
Hmmm ... Why do they stay when I'm just like everyone else they cut off ... Probably cause they don't kno the real story .. Gotta get my act together ... Time to readjust .. Maybe it's time to deal with my aggression ... 
And nothing lasts forever , for all good things it's true , \ 
I'd rather trade it all while somehow saving you\ 
It must have been the season\ 
That threw us out of line\ 
Once I stood so tall\ 
Now I'm searching for a sign\ 
- A7x \Victim \"" 
So friends ? Nope i don't need them . My sister has my back and thats the only friend i'll ever need ! When everybodys fake I know she'll be real . She can jump on my back cause i can handle her weight , not sure if she can hold mine but that's a < PROPMALE > i'll take . 
So Lil Sis ! Jlysa < PROPFEMALE > Robinson I love you and I appreciate everything you do for me ! Big Bro ! < PROPFIRST > McGee You're Amazing and you're a great guy don't worry good things always find their way back . < PROPFEMALE > JMamiee Estaba i'm sorry . Simply stated . You were right . < PROPFEMALE > Smilesz you're a great friend ! And you were there when i needed you ! Thanks ! < PROPFIRST > Rogers I love you too . 
O ! And dont worry only those tagged in my status can see it ! 
Man sisters suck and they make my stomach and head hurt , and make sleeping so damn hard ... 
suppose to be sleep but that aint happening tonight or this morning or watever ... 
Wow its been a rough day just found out my boyfriend is joining the marines and finishing school in may and my bro is joining the army .. plus im tired and still kinda confused and have a headache life is crumbling right now 
So .. I'm extremely proud of my sister Jlysa < PROPFEMALE > Robinson for her 97 on her < PROPMALE > final ! Highest grade in the class !! :-) 
Pulled a muscle in my back ! Because i got pushed down the stairs -__- .. Wonderful ! 
Yay !! I go to Washington D.C. in a month !! can't wait !! 
The Only Continent I havent been to is Alaska !! lol this girl is funny ... 
Rubber cement and white out smell AMAZING !!!!!!!!!! 
Being a loner is starting to look like a great idea again .. No friends No nothing .. just being alone ... 
Crazy how friendship works out .. My decision is killing my stomach .. can't tell if it was for the better or worst ... thought it'd give me peace but now it feels more restless ... 
Shoulders hurt really bad ... Squats , deadlifts , bench , and curls ... So Sore .. 
Thinking that i made a huge mistake . Guess I never told you that i'm a runner , I can't handle alot of stress . I'm just prone to abandoning people I guess . Sorry :-( 
Where are you when I need you ? 
Well i'm deeply hurt , I was calling my sis Jlysa < PROPFEMALE > Robinson to tell her that i love her before i died from getting attacked with snow by a bunch of people but she sent me to voicemail .. :-( .. And now i'm slowly dying .. 
I can close my ears to what I don't want to hear but I can't close my heart to what I don't want to feel ... 
I LOVE Hueduc < PROPFEMALE > !!!!!! :D 
There's a special kind of freedom sisters enjoy . Freedom to share innermost thoughts , to ask a favor , to show their true feelings . The freedom to not worry if depending on them is a risk . The freedom to simply be themselves . The freedom to love until you can't love anymore . But with all freedom there's plenty responsibility . But sometimes sisters don't realize the freedoms until its too late .. 
So I just want Siyu < PROPFEMALE > , Hueduc < PROPFEMALE > , and < PROPFIRST > Shih to know that ya'll make life AMAZING !!! Havent been this happy in forever !!! Nor have i said I love you this much !! Ya'll are making me emotional !! But I Love You Guys !!!! 
Sooo tired of reading for AP ... Church in few .. then more reading .. -_- 
My past nor my present is gonna keep me from my future ... 
Damn people these days are boring .. need to find someone to talk to .. -_-
