And you’re so hateful sometimes Throwing punches at lies Fall from somewhere above\ 
Just to say you’re in love So you < PROPFEMALE > yourself from stolen dreams And under the table you hide every stain Watch it disappear The dream you hold so dear 
gettin ' ready for my interview . Wish me luck !! 
I've been locked inside your Heart-Shaped box for weeks I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap 
Too vague , too vague . You can try to resolve the past right now , But I swear I'll be the one To let the world know what you've done WATCH YOUR BACK , YOU'LL LOSE YOURSELF ! THIS IS A BATTLEGROUND ! WHEN WILL THEY KNOW , Your life's a lie . 
Get up , get out , \ 
who's gonna break our fall , \ 
When we don't back down , they're gonna seem so small , \ 
We keep em running for the door , 
take me back to the person i used to be way back when we were stupid and held grudges just to help us sleep oh my god how rediculous were we 
got a new haircut yesterday the lady had a very liberal view of how short i wanted it .... oh well its cute anyway lol 
You can scream out loud But your panic falls on deaf ears This is where you brought yourself And this is what you've always feared There's a faceless crowd with no sympathy So you can scream out loud But there's no one listening 
the guilt's no good and it only shames us more and the truth that we all try to hide its oh so clear when it not our lies we dont face the blame 
\What you do ? Try to walk and chew gum at the same time \"" 
Facebook : crack of the 21st century 
wish i could sleep some more but oh well busy day then goin to the park 2nite for fireworks !! 
Conscience is a faint , unpleasant sound , You've worried enough , but here's your < PROPMALE > so take it Dammit I hope you take it\ 
A heart attack is sleeping in your chest , waiting until the timing's best\ 
So make a move , while you're still breathing Say so long to innocence\ 
From underneath the evidence\ 
You taste like Heaven , but God knows you're built for sin 
In your eyes Like my first time That I caught fire Just stay with me Lay with me In your eyes I lost my place Could stay a while and I'm melting In your eyes Like my first time That I caught fire Just stay with me lay with me 
cuz i'm the perfect mistake i'm hopin ' you'll make rite now 
I see your face every time I close my eyes It's getting worse , \ 
you say it comes as no surprise\ 
Why am I hell-bent on losing \ 
When I can't get you out of my head 
Should've said something , but I've said it enough . \ 
By the way , my words were faded . \ 
Rather waste some time with you . 
<3 but i was young and i was in love with the idea of love <3 
All we are is a bittersweet sundown\ 
You gave me every bit of your heart\ 
And I'm the one that let you down\ 
I can't keep you around\ 
In this bittersweet sundown\ 
We're a bittersweet sundown\ 
We're a bittersweet memory now 
Have faith in me Cause there are things that I've seen I don't believe\ 
So cling to what you know and never let go You should know things \ 
aren't always what they seem\ 
I said I'd never let you go , and I never did\ 
I said I'd never let you fall and I always meant it\ 
If you didn't have this < PROPMALE > then I never did\ 
You'll always find me right there , again 
<3 You're a < PROPFEMALE > how I found you I still don't know But now I've got you and I'll never let you go If your heart's a pocket looking for some change\ 
My heart makes lots of sense\ 
Just stay quiet , breathe deep , breathe out , breathe slow \ 
Don't say a word Let our eyes speak\ 
And they will tell you <3 
Swirling shades of blue Slow dancing in your eyes The sun kisses the earth\ 
And I hush my urge to cry ' cause I hear the whispered words In your masterpiece beautiful You speak the unspeakable through I love you too 
So many wasted days\ 
Come and go like ocean waves\ 
It hits me like a freight train\ 
And now I can't get off my face 
dear sleep i miss you ! why am i up at 7 in the morning ? its not even a school day !! 
i'd shoot for the < PROPFEMALE > but i'm too busy gazin ' at stars 
You sound so innocent , all full of good intent\ 
Swear you know best\ 
But you expect me to jump up on board with you\ 
And ride off into your delusional sunset 
The skeletons are screaming for one last dance\ 
It's all the same , the same old sound\ 
This is the end of the underground

Chill , is it something real Or the magic I'm feeding off your fingers\ 
Can't ever keep from falling apart At the seams\

And today we remember to live and to love

Knowing I can't turn the rain into sun any more I've given you all that I have , \ 
Now I stand here , too scared to hold your hand . Afraid you might wake to see The monster that had to leave Under the ash and the lies , Something beautiful once here now dies And the tears burn my eyes

I've been swallowed by this wreck that you call your life . I'm damaged from the inside . I've been broken . Don't threaten me with what you think I feel . \ 
If you could read my mind you'd be in tears .

At the seams , \ 
I cannot believe their taking my heart , \ 
Into pieces

The scars of your love , remind me of us . They keep me thinking that we almost had it all The scars of your love , they leave me breathless I can't feeling\ 
We could of had it all Rolling in the deep You had my heart inside your hand And you played it to the beat\ 
~ Adele
