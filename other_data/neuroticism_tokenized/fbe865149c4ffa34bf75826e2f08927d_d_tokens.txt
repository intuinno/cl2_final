As so many lately have pointed out what a geezer I am getting to be , I'd just like to say that this getting old thing isn't so bad . It sure beats the alternative . What really concerns me is this ' growing up ' thing . 

17% yield on a stock these days ... Who'd have thought it ? I'm not saying you should buy it but I did ... CIM . Just FYI . It's just money and ya gotta do something with it , ya know . 
Just talked to a friend in Mobile , < PROPMALE > assigned to figure out how to stop the oil leak . He and some more of the brightest minds in the country are stumped ! Quoted : \Our < PROPMALE > concern now is safety . We have no idea how to stop this thing . \ " \ 
People want to hi-jack your facebook account ? What's up with that ? What can they possibly do or say that I haven't already done or said . No points here for originality ... 
And < PROPFEMALE > , if you are out there , I love you , miss you , and am counting the days till you can come visit . Dad 
Off to Wildwood Park for some good food and music . Mountain Heart was an awesome concert last night . So I just can't wait to see what's on for today . 
From the creative mind of Daves Twangy Pepper Sauces .. A new experience . Green tomatos , green habaneros . Now , should these be cooked together , sweet pickled , or dill pickled ? I haven't had a good pickled green tomato in a long time and it could go that way . Any input from my sauce fans ? 
And you know that a portfolio of stocks with an aggregate yield of around 15% ought to go up in $$$ . Pfffffttt ! No joy here today . Can't wait until this holiday stuff is over and some real traders come back to work .
