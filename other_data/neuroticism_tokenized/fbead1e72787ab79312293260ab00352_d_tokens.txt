Faith is not necessary when you know how things are going to work out , - that's knowledge . It's in the time of unknowing that having faith is what sees you through to the other side . Faith is what gives you strength . Faith is that light in your heart that keeps on shining even when it's all darkness outside . 
really wants it to snow :]
