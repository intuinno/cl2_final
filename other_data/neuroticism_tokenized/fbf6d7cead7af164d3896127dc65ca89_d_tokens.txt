Even tho ' we don't leave until tomorrow morning -- vacation has OFFICIALLY started !! woo-hoo !!! 

Good day yesterday ... took the dog to the ' puppy spa ' and started the drive to Florida ... made it to Macon , GA . Only 7 or so more hours drive time today before we can lounge at the pool ..... 
We are safely in South Florida ..... car unpacked , have already had ' vacation beer ' -- it always tastes better on vacation ...... and we have been swimming ... Life is good ! 
Last day of vacation .... it goes by soooo quickly ...... oh well , a grand time was had by all ! 
Like it isn't bad enough that I am addicted to Mafia Wars ..... now I am getting hooked on Farm Town ! What's up with that ? I am a city slicker through and through !!!! 
So glad it's Friday ! Tomorrow is the Muddy River Run at IPFW and Sunday we are seeing the Producers at the Civic . Woo-hoo !! 
What a GREAT weekend ! Yesterday we went to the Muddy River Run car show at IPFW , then last night to a Tin Caps game at the new stadium ( with < PROPMALE > & Mal ) . Today , we saw the Producers at the Civic . It was a fantastic show -- and a fantastic weekend !! I n 
what a relaxing weekend ..... at least summer has finally hit the midwest ..... actually turned on the A/C today 
I hate being sick ...... ( literally ) slept all day today ..... feel like I wasted the day .... 
Yeeeaahhhh .... it's the weekend , it's the weekend , it's the weekend !! woo-hoo !!! 
I have had ENOUGH of it all ! 
Retail therapy is the greatest thing ever invented !! ( For you guys out there , retail therapy means SHOPPING !!! ) 
Today was my surgery . It went fairly well . Apparently I have an aversion to breathing during surgery . My O2 sats dropped to 76% and I got hypothermic , along with a few other minor challenges . But all in all , a successful surgery . 
this is way to early to be up ..... the sunrise should be anticipated from still being up , not by getting up early to see it ..... 
< PROPMALE > Bowes -- I still remember the first time you came to PI with that < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > cover band -- and then we stole you away and made you one of our own . I will always remember your talent , your smile and your positive attitude . May God greet your warmly tonight and may he provide comfort to those you left behind . 
is looking for guidance and wisdom . And maybe not ALL the answers , but at least SOME of them ...... 
Thank you everyone for the birthday wishes ! It was a wonderful day !!!!! 
is wondering why people just can't play nicely together ...... 
just got home from the most amazing show I have ever seen !!! Trans Siberian Orchestra . 17 semi's , 10 busses . Smoke , Fog , Haze , LN2 , multi colored Lasers , Pyro , Snow , flying stages/performers , multiple flame effects , every sort of moving light imaginable , flying/moving trusses , fantastic audio , LED screens , projections , and a number of effects that I haven't figured out yet -- oh yeah , the Orchestra was fabulous too ! 
Let's see how many people on fb aren't ashamed to show their love for God and admit that Jesus is their Savior .... We need to get God back in America ... If your'e not ashamed , copy and paste this in your status . 
TGIF Baby !!!!!!! 
Looking forward to a four day weekend with family !! 
ahhhhh .... Christmas is rapidly approaching ...... looking forward to family , friends and some much needed time off work ...... sadly , motivation is nowhere to be found in my office right now ........ oh well , I'll stumble across it eventually ...... 
cards mailed last week ....... presents all bought and all wrapped and under the tree ...... now I guess I should clean the house before the family all starts arriving mid week ..... and a big thank you to my wonderful husband who has already started cleaning/prepping the house and is doing a fabulous job of it ! 
They may want to take Christ out of Christmas , but they wont take Christ out of me . If you are proud to be a Christian and are not ashamed of Christ , then post this as your status for 1 day as a light to the world . Many people will be too ashamed or scared to do this . 
There comes a time in life , when you walk away from all the pointless drama\ 
and people who create it . You surround yourself with people who make\ 
you laugh so hard that you forget the bad and focus on the good . Life\ 
is too short to be anything but happy ! -- I borrowed this from another status , but I think it sums up my resolutions for 2011 . 
I asked Jesus how much do you love me ? Jesus replied this much , and streched his arms on the cross and died . If you belive in God put this in your status . 97% of you won't put this in your status . . what Jesus did on the cross he was thinking of you . 3% of you will stand up for him and put this in your status ! 
Well , we booked the cruise today ! 7 glorious days at sea with stops in Grand Caymen , Cozumel , Belize and Isla Roatan ! Totally psyched !!! 
To all my Entertainment Kin -- Does anyone have a source for Super Trooper Rentals in the Midwest ?? 
It's amazing how thinking of someone out of the blue takes you on a trip down memory lane ...... remembering the good times in college , at Busch Gardens , Disney ..... looking at friends FB pages and recalling even more people ...... 
is so very , very happy that it's Friday ! Wishing < PROPMALE > a FANTASTIC trip ! Hoping that < PROPMALE > gets some much needed down time this weekend . Hoping that < PROPFEMALE > comes back to work very soon . Prayers for < PROPFEMALE > and < PROPFIRST > and all those who are in pain ( emotional or physical ) . And definitely looking forward to some quality time with my < PROPFEMALE > this weekend !! 
Life is too short to wake up with regrets . ? So love the people who treat you right . ? Pray for the one's who don't ? Believe everything happens for a reason ? If you get a second < PROPMALE > , grab it with both hands ? If it changes your life , let it ? Nobody said life would be easy , they just promised it would be worth it . Post to your wall if you agree ..... 
Lets support our police , firefighters and EMS . If you support our police , firefighters and EMS then please post this on your status and leave it there for one hour . There should be no excuses from anyone !! This should appear in everyone's status !!!! God bless our Police , Firefighters and EMS !! 
This is for those who know someone , or have been affected by someone , who needs a smack upside the head . People who need a smack upside the head affect the lives of many . There is still no known cure for someone who deserves a smack upside the head , except a smack upside the head . Let's help cure this dangerous affliction . 
sniff .... sniff .... sniff ...... what's that smell ?...... oh yeah ..... it's VACATION !!! :-) 
How sad ...... vacation anticipated for so long and Zip , it's over .......

Great News ! The Captain and Tenille have left my head ! Muskrat Love is no longer stuck in my head . Nope , today's song ( stuck in my head ) is : What would you d o-o o-o o for a Klondike Bar ..... 
RiverFest 2010 is over ...... except for the crying ...... and maybe a little clean up ..... 
thank you Beyonce for the song that is inexplicably stuck in my head ...... ' all the single ladies , all the single ladies ' ....... just that refrain , nothing else ...... 
.... after Monday and Tuesday , even the calendar says WTF ....... 
amusing things I have seen during the last two days ........ actual license plate in Tennessee : ' 420 WTF ' ...... signs in Georgia : ' Withlacoochee Lake ' and ' Fork Deep Creek ' ....... 
.... actual sign seen today in Kentucky ........ ' Sullivan Farm : Used Cows for Sale ' ...... ummm , Really ?

Rain , rain go away , come again another -- oh wait , what do I care , I'll be stuck in the office all day , so Bring It ! ha ha 
went to the Trace Adkins/Toby < PROPFIRST > concert in Indy last night ...... one row up was a guy wearing his < PROPFIRST > Posner ' cooler than me ' sunglasses from the event we did on campus over the summer ! I kid you not ! 
was wondering why this afternoon was just draaaging , then realized the clock on my desk stopped 2 1/2 hours ago and that it's actually time to go home ! 
This evening I had the distinct privilege of attending ' The Laramie Project ' at First Pres . It was powerful & poignant as it described the aftermath of a hate crime in a small town . The cast brought the citizens of Laramie , WY to the stage & by the end of the show I felt like I knew each one of them personally . I had the honor of meeting < PROPFEMALE > Shephard last year & am so glad I was able to attend this . 
just got back from the < PROPFIRST > Appleseed festival with Mom and < PROPFIRST > .... lots of fun stuff ! < PROPFIRST > got a rabbit pelt and watched some blacksmithing and there were funnel cakes for everyone ! A good time was had by all ! 
has to work today and is not totally stoked about it ..... 
has a day off today ! Woo-hoo !! 
just got home from work and is having the the dinner of champions -- Rice Krispies and Diet Coke ! 
just got home from work a little bit ago and is having tonight's dinner of champions : Popcorn and Orange Juice . < PROPFEMALE > Child eat your heart out ! 
has an IMPORTANT Warning : Do NOT try to swallow a sudafed tablet using Diet Coke . It suddenly becomes a foul tasting foaming pop rock , it won't go away and things only go down hill from there ! 
just got home from work and quite frankly is too tired to even care about dinner . The Diet Coke experiments will just have to wait until tomorrow night ...... If anyone is cooking breakfast that is another story all together , I will be at work at 6:45 am and am pretty sure I'll be hungry ...... :-) 
So glad it's Friday ! Lost a filling , broke a nail and can't ditch my sinus headache ...... I need a couple of days off !! 
did not lose a filling . Instead , I broke my tooth ! I go into the dentist today and he says , ' holy cow , I've never seen a tooth break like this!' Instead of taking out a cusp , I took a \V\ " out of the middle of it . That was fun . Stupid McDonald's chicken sandwich . " 
just had a FABULOUS lunch with < PROPMALE > Albaugh !! He suggested Chinese Delivery and I caved ....... mmmmmm ..... so tasty !! 
and < PROPMALE > Zerkle did our part to stimulate the economy today !! In 6 weeks we will have new patio doors !! woo-hoo !! 
knows it was definitely a Monday . Interesting meeting this afternoon to say the least . Currently , zero < PROPFEMALE > in the Zerkle household to cook dinner -- so Chinese delivery it is !! 
feels so honored ! I got to see < PROPFEMALE > Whitcraft two days in a row !!! 
just had a fabulous dinner with < PROPMALE > Zerkle < PROPFIRST > McClure and < PROPFIRST > Zerkle !! And thanks to < PROPFEMALE > Kallmyer Beights for the quote of the day : \there's nothing like 2 pounds of steaks for your birthday ! \""

I saw several people from work , and < PROPFIRST > Wearley , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > , < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > , Kenzie < PROPMALE > and Krissa Zimmerman < PROPMALE > !! A fun time was had by all !! And \Word\ " to my New Co-Chair Krissa !! "

I may not be the most beautiful or the sexiest , nor do I have the \perfect body\ " . I might not be someone's first choice but I'm a great choice . I don't pretend to be someone I'm not because I'm good at being me . I'm not proud of some of the things I've done in the past but I'm proud of who I am today . Take me as I am or watch me as I walk away . Post this if you're proud of being you ..! " 
< PROPMALE > Parrent was Rockin ' the house tonight at the Rhinehart Music Center !! It was great to see you again my friend !! 
Best quote overheard today : \Is your machine butch enough for leather ? \"" 
If your mom is or was your hero , your best friend , or just the best mom ever , if you are blessed to still have your mom or if she is an angel in heaven , paste this to your status and let everyone know you are proud of your mom , and that you love her dearly . You can replace a lot of people in life , but you only have one mom ! \ 
-- My Mom TOTALLY Rocks !! 
Go Vikings ! Wait , what ? They're not in the playoffs ?? Okay , Go Colts !! What , they aren't either ?? Okay , when do pitchers and catchers report ? Go Cubbies !! 
Not sure what is scarier : While cleaning out the back of the fridge just now -- 1 . ) I discovered the leftover Canned Cranberry Jelly from Thanksgiving . OR 2 . ) The fact that it looked just like when I put it in there in November !! 
Greetings to < PROPMALE > Hendricks and < PROPMALE > D Tucker whom I had the pleasure of seeing today while they were safely protecting the city from the Target Parking Lot !! And belated greetings to Christella K . Crickard who I saw yesterday in the same parking lot ( but didn't get to say hi to ) . 
Watch your thoughts , for they become words . \ 
Watch your words , for they become actions . \ 
Watch your actions , for they become habits . 
In honor of < PROPFIRST > Equality Velez they just spelled the word Tortilla in the < PROPFIRST > County Spelling < PROPFEMALE > !!

is wondering how many people in Northeast Indiana didn't plan ahead for their Super Bowl Parties and had to drive to Ohio to get beer today ........ 
why is it that Friday's from 1p-5p is the loooooongest part of the week ? 
There is nothing quite like a Boat Drink , lovingly made by your wonderful husband on a cold Saturday afternoon , to remind you of warm , happy places ........

In honor of ms awareness week ( 3/7-3/13 ) please post this as your status for 1 hour if u or someone u love has multiple sclerosis ( ms ) . Please do not capitalize the letters - I believe that it gives it more power & WE are much stronger than a disease ! I know my friends will . My prayer is that in 2011 a cure will be found .

I have absolutely no idea how to fit 35 lbs of potatoes into an 8 lb bag ! 
Family isn't always blood . It's the people in your life who want you\ 
in theirs ; the ones who accept you for who you are . The ones who\ 
would do anything to see you smile , and who love you no matter what . 
I broke outta jail !! Thanks for the cake with the file !!! Still raising money for MDA if anyone can help ! 
So we're off to a banner start in RMC this morning ..... the City Wide Worship group is Rockin ' out onstage and the building fire alarm tripped at 7:30 this morning while we were setting up ... pretty exciting stuff ....... 
Let's start the countdown shall we ? T-minus 17 days until RiverFest is done . And T-minus 29 days until vacation begins !! Can I get a woo-hoo ?! :-)
