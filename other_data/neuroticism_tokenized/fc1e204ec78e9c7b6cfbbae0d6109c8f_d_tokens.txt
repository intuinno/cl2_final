Blockbuster is having a Final sale on November 15th . 11am ~ 10pm . 
So uh ... I got home from work right ? And like ... everything was going well .... until I was walking towards my house and this eerie whistling tune was echoing in my neighborhood ... like .. the ice cream man song ... only creepier . O_e 
' s Song of the Day : One Less Lonely Girl - < PROPFIRST > Bieber 
=_= woke up at 5am , ran a little ... then went to the gym . Afterwards .... I was thrown around like a ragdoll teaching someone some Modified Judo ... On a bright note .... the Fourth Kind was a good movie . :) 
A question popped into my mind ... Did anyones life go according to how they planned it ? Mine sure didnt lol . Well , except for travelling the world , that kinda came true , only visited like 20% of the world . 
I have discovered the secret to life ..... \F**k shortcuts\ " 1 second of quick happiness/pleasure can lead to a whole hour of \ " Why the Eff did I do that ? \"" 
Weeeeee ! I think I got myself into trouble . :3 
Drama when it's unneeded is definitely drama created by bored dramatics . Stop it . 
They say the key to a successful relationship ... is compromise . For example , if say I , for instance wanted to sleep with the window open , and the miss wanted to sleep with the window closed , We'd sleep with the window closed . Do you see where I'm getting at here ? If you suggest we slightly open the window .. just a teeny bit , you'll be shunned for not being equal and caring about the miss's emotions . 
I found something interesting in a shoebox today ... a nice pair of shoes . . . . and 20 bucks in it :D 
Haha Hangover/Inglorious Bastards Movie night .... so much racism and alcohol at once . 
Just woke up ... where am I ... what time is it ? Do I HAVE to get up ?... Why the hell is it so cold ... I don't see an emergency ... no need to get up ... 5 more minutes .... * sleep * 
Happy new years peeps , its a wild night so let's live it up and make it wilder ! 
What ... the fruit ... happened last night LOL . Oh well that's how ya start the new year off ! Party hardy and not remember anything in the mornin ... clean slate ... missing a sock and skyy vodka as a cuddle mate . 
Lol who is fatter ... the person who finished eating first ? Or the person still eating after everyone is done eating ? ( aka last one ) 
So I was playing Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 ... and during a Hardcore TDM , I decided to < PROPMALE > a grenade ... into a wall . Needless to say physics did its part and returned my gift to me and took out me and the three enemies behind me that I didnt know about . In a real war ... does this mean Im heroic dead or ... just dead . 
So I get a message telling me about breast cancer awareness . Explaining the purpose of the whole \Im wearing __________\ " and stuff . But I think they took it kinda far when they asked me to post MY color . " 
The mind is like a parachute . It doesn’t work unless it’s open . And when it is open , You get chances . The only time you run out of chances is when you stop taking them . No matter the outcome , Don’t let your victories go to your head , or your failures go to your heart . 
Those who criticize our generation ... forget who raised it . Oddly , those who were raised by previous generations ... blame everyone else but themselves . Grow up , raise yourself . :p Problem solved . 
There is something about today that disrupts my thoughts , interferes with my balance , and urks my damn-o-meter .... I can only think of 2 things .... 1)I sense impending doom or 2)I am hungry . Just to be safe ... I will grab a snicker . 
... I'm sick ?!? No ... it must be a fluke . I'm never sick ... I'm invincible . What should I do ?!?! This is all so new to me ... OH ! Maybe I should raid the fridge and eat everything ... that'll teach ' em to sick me . 
Had the weirdest freakin dream last night . It involved 10,000 people defending the castle from the devastating swarm of .... Sea Gnomes . And in the front lines was ... the < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > Heavy weapons drill team ... Oh yea ... epic . Everyone from the team was there ... even the veteran members . 
Sparring match 6am ... I hope they dont hit me in the face ... or eye ... I need to look like an asian guy for work ... not a panda . 
Time to hit the gym for 4 hours ... then go play couch potato , then pig out ... making the whole working out thing kinda pointless ... Perhaps I'll grab a diet pepsi .... it seems to make all the people on \diets\ " feel better ... then after 2 weeks they'll wonder why their diet isn't working ... stupid diet . " 
Super bowl , my team wins ... and then I get these bandwagon basterds coming in pretending they were long time fans . Haha . Leechers . 
So here I am , sore after the work out . Came home took a shower , checked myself out in the mirror ... \oh yes\ " then went to the door to open it .... and turn the knob and * BAM * walked into the door . Apparently I opened it the wrong way ... Moral of the story ... don't be conceited ... not for even a little bit . Bad < PROPFEMALE >." 
Chuc mung < PROPFEMALE > moi , pplz :p Time to paaaarty ... and if you work ( like me ) party at work mwahahaha . 
The following sentence is false . The preceding sentence is true . Are these sentences true or false ?

O_O ... Heavy Rain ... Exceed my expectations ... Holy fapbubbles . 
Jogging in the rain . The rain is heavy today . Press X for Haiku . 
Awesome night of Boxing ( I am bruised in places I dont recall being hit at ... Ninja boxers . ) , Basketball ( well , warmed up , but Go < PROPFEMALE > ! I gib ya props ) , Sushi ( Domo Ari-freakin-gato ) , And 2 hours of working out fun to sweat out the frustrations and chub-chubs . 
Hmm , I feel very expendable ._. like Lays Potato chips in the hands of a 2 year old ... * crunch crunch * and crumbs . 
Went for a run at 5am . While taking a breather , I had a flashback , there I saw the Heavy weapons drill team and the Sabre team spinnin and having fun ... then ..... * AHHH SPRINKLERS * I run away from the watery ambush .

got a concussion ... I think . That match was brutal . 
So I was trying to speak correctly at work , that concussion must've screwed up something cuz I couldn't get a full sentence out without either switching to Vietnamese or slurring like I'm an alcoholic . Can you imagine me saying this to a customer : \So hey < PROPFEMALE > give you < PROPMALE > bags of blaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah . \"" 
Stargazing . =D 
LOL has gone from meaning , \laugh out loud\ " to \ " I have nothing else to say \"." 
Do you remember when you were a kid , playing Nintendo and it wouldn't work ? You take the cartridge out , blow in it and that would magically fix the problem . Every kid gamer did that , but how did we all know how to fix the problem ? There was no internet or message boards or FAQ's . We just figured it out .... Today's kids are soft . 
I was watching my nephew play \Just Cause 2\ " he tried to do a base jump off the top of a Hot air balloon ... on the jump down a crop-duster plane flew into him and sky-dragged him for a few seconds ... and crashed into a falling hot air balloon ... " 
While driving home from the gym today , I saw a banana peel in the road and I instinctively swerved to avoid it ... thanks a lot < PROPFIRST > Kart . 
Learned something recently ... It came as a shock to me . And I find it hard to believe there are actually people who get in the shower first and THEN turn on the water . 
Nothing sucks more than that moment during an argument when you realize you're wrong ... except for the moment during an argument when you know you're right but you just said you were wrong just to shut THEM up . 
Watching Capitalism : A Love Story . So intrigueing . 
Battlefield : Bad Company 2 - I need a new squad , my old one has this one annoying guy who doesn't know how to dodge bullets . I ran across a river , shot 2 guys , jumped OVER a tank , shot another guy , and ( As a medic ) I revived Mr. Annoying back to life with my difibulator ... then he takes like 3 steps and get killed .... then he yells at me for not helping . 
Riddles can't be solved if the person doesn't know its a riddle . Unless they are ninja ... then nevermind . Are you a ninja ? Are you ? 
\The last thing I want to do is hurt you . But it's still on the list ... One step at a time . \ " This is when you know the relationship you are in is going the wrong direction . " 
Wow ... so ... they took \gullible\ " out of the dictionary O_o . " 
Why is it when you drop your own pride to make peace with someone , that person is too prideful to make peace ? 
The only way to keep your health is to eat what you don't want , drink what you don't like , and do what you'd rather not ...... Something is very wrong here ....

Let's assume the whole world is against me , always keeping me down . And Let's assume , I couldn't take it anymore , and started a rebellion . Now let's assume , we are outnumbered still , and people quit on our cause . Let's assume the ones that remain are the true crew , family till the end . Ok , so now we can assume that assuming is a bad thing , but hey , it helps us prepare for the world's BS . so ..... HA !

During my work out/boxing , I had an epiphany : We all study hard , and struggle through life , we stress , we separate , we come together , the poor try to be < PROPMALE > , the < PROPMALE > forget what it's like to be poor ... we go through years of book reading and tests to get a piece of paper that tells us that we are able do something . 
\I can't afford < PROPFEMALE > 
Wherever my feet may guide me , I consciously walk blindly . \ 
Afraid of every step , of every corner , \ 
I hate the suspense , but my senses say go forward . \

Never miss an opportunity to make others happy , even if you have to leave them alone in order to do it . Pick battles big enough to matter , small enough to win . 
This one time , someone showed me a glass of water that was half full . And he \ 
said , \Is it half full or half empty ? \ " So I drank the water . No more \

A light that tears through those clouds~That's our guy . \ 
We all miss you bro , yes , that's true ... \

Yo , don't take your shit out on other people . We all have our troubles , and don't need you starting more . You mad at yourself , not us . Maybe you shouldn't think everything revolves around you . I helped you on your feet and you decide you're too good for us \lower beings\ " now ? "

There are many things I am grateful for ... but too long a list to name . So I guess in the end , the best word that can describe everything and everyone . Is ...... You .

It's a beautiful day ! That must mean ONE thing .... play tennis and then sit inside playing various video games all day . >:) 
Assume that you have a non-empty set of natural < PROPFIRST > that are not interesting . Due to the well-ordered property of the natural < PROPFIRST > , there must be some smallest number in the set of uninteresting < PROPFIRST > . Being the smallest number of a set one might consider not interesting makes that number interesting after all : a contradiction ... Therefore there is no such thing as an uninteresting natural number . 
Oh look a pillow . I go sleep now . 
Heads up . If someone says you a 10 . Make sure they using the right scale . Think about it . Let's say they use a kilogram scale and they called you a 10 ( in lbs ) .... you'd be a 4.5

You know , I used to think it was awful that life was so unfair . Then I thought , wouldn't it be much worse if life were fair , and all the terrible things that happen to us come because we actually deserve them ? So , now I take great comfort in the general hostility and unfairness of the universe . 
Haha ... \it's gettin hot in here\ " is playin on a cold day ... maybe if I play it on repeat it'll get warmer .... time to test theory . "

Busted left wrist , busted right leg ... that ain't gonna stop me from workin ' out after work today ... 
So we like things that have been good to us - and good for us . If you think about it , this makes liking very rational . It is rational to like something that is good for us . \ 
So let me ask you : do you think romantic love works the same way ? Are we rational about it , too ? Do we typically fall in love with people who are good to us and good for us ?

< re-focus > Ah ok , I gotta snap out of this slump of frustration . Shake it off , bro , shake it off ! < /re-focus > 
It's been a rough day . I got up this morning . I put a shirt on and a button fell off . I picked up my backpack , and the strap came off . I'm afraid to go to the bathroom .... 
Starting tomorrow ... I'm re-instating my work out routine . Starting with the basics . I have a dream , and this injury isn't getting in the way of it ! If you take responsibility for yourself you will develop a hunger to accomplish your dreams . And goddamnit I'm huuuungry 
Don't let someone else's opinion of you become your reality . 
Clavicle 80% healed ... get ready for Physical condition ! >=D I'm baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack !..... almost 
At some point in your life , you are going to have to hold a baby . When that time comes , you will discover that babies are terrifying and they hate you . You might even want to hold it at first . But as soon as the baby is in your arms , you will realize that holding it was a mistake . 
Gah !... eye is bleeding > . O 
Today feels like one of those days . I'm gonna just run laps ' till my legs can't run no more . Then play tennis at a park or something ... Sweeeeeeet ~ 
C.O.S.N.O.P. 
A word to the wise ain't necessary - it's the stupid ones that need the advice .... 
People say good people don't know what temptation means . This is an obvious lie . Only those who try to resist temptation know how strong it is .... A person who gives in to temptation after five minutes simply does not know what it would have been like an hour later . That is why bad people , in a sense , know very little about badness . They have lived a sheltered life by always giving in . 
See , the problem is that God gives men a brain and a penis , and only enough blood to run one at a time ... and even then , the blood is biased ... 
Never fear shadows . They simply mean there's a light shining somewhere nearby . 
Everyone is entitled to be stupid , but some abuse the privilege ... Which brings me to another familiar quote : If pro is opposite of con , then what is the opposite of progress ? 
WHY ARE YA'LL SPAMMING ME WITH ANTI-SPAM MESSAGES AHHHHH ! 
Dear , weather ... you're making hella noise .... I'm trying to sleep . Shhhhhhhhhhh Thank you . From < PROPMALE > , with love . 
I would be unstoppable if I could just get started . 
You’d think that after all these years of practice , I’d be good at waking up by now ... 
Aaaaaaaaaand it was worth it . 
Before you criticize someone , you should walk a mile in their shoes . That way , when you criticize them , you're a mile away and you have their shoes .... Protfit XD 
Don't go around saying the world owes you a living . The world owes you nothing . It was here first . So instead of sittin ' there complainin ' , do something with your life , the world ain't gonna wait .... Now stop calling me when I'm enjoying my ramen . 
The real trouble with reality is that there's no background music . 
Protip : Never interrupt your opponent while he's making a mistake ... That'd be rude . 
Everyone has the ability of making someone happy , some by entering the room , others by leaving it . Then there is me .... I come in the room , grab some food , and then leave the room . 
The truth many people never understand , until its too late , is that the more you try to avoid suffering the more you suffer because smaller and more insignificant things begin to torture you in proportion to your fear of being hurt . So what do we do ? Anything . Something . So long as we just don't sit there . If we screw it up , try something else . If we wait until we've satisfied all uncertainties , it may be too late . 
? _ ? School soon . 
T -t-t- time for a BBQ , Pool Party , MORE BBQ and a good friendly ( and potentially profiting ) game of cards . So much things to get ready for and its only noon , hoooooo-boy ..... 
... Terraria eh ? looks promising . 
There she goes , Just'a walkin ' down the street ...

You can tell more about a person by what ( s)he says about others than you can by what others say about him/her . \ 
Had to make that apply to both genders XD

? (????) nuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu my punching bag split .... 
It isn't the fault of somebody else that you are offended . The fault lies with you that YOU are offended , because it isn't the person that offends , but your own preconceived notions and attitudes that offend . If you let things get to you , it'll be offensive ... Basically , I'm not gonna sugar-coat shit , go find someone else to comfort you with lies . Come back to me when you're sick of lies and want facts . 
Been curb stompin ' zombies on Dead Island ALL DAY >=D 
Today started out interesting ... Woke up borderline late to beat the traffic . But wait ! had to shower and such ! So did all that , then as I walked out the door , my dad jumps out of the bushes and pops my upside my face with nunchucks and runs off laughing wildly ... Then I woke up ... borderline late to beat traffic . Should've seen me all paranoid as I walked passed those bushes .

I'm doing a lil project . So I have a question to ask you all . You walk into a city , buildings tower over each other , blocking out the sky . You turn the corner and lets assume there is a sign that says \The Ghettos\ " \ 
The only complaint I have about BF3 : Beta is that it isn't BF3 : outNow 
\Oh 
I need to stop parking in the parking structures ... I always somehow choose the ONE parking spot that has someone having sex in the car next to it . ALWAYS . I mean sure whatever floats their boat and all but when I get out the car and awkwardly see them gettin ' it on and we make eye contact ... like all three of us ... I mean what am I suppose to do ? * Thumbs up * and continue on with my life ? Cuz thats was my reaction ... 
Look ... if you're going to threaten me over the phone , then tell me that I WON'T do anything about it , then tell me WHERE you are , please don't waste my time when I show up 4 mins later and find you driving away . 
So ... keifer Blockbuster became < PROPFEMALE>'s Thrift Store ... I'm amused XD

Hmmm Battlefield 3 Coop , if my internet stops being a < PROPMALE > , someone join me in Hard Mode Coop and start wiping this out ! AzureVRomeo , add meh ;D 
Switching from Battlefield 3 Console to PC was .... taxing for me ... I'd be in the top 2 each game on console every round , with 3000+ points ...... now on PC I'm down to mid-rankings with 1000-1500 points ... at least I can fly air vehicles like boss >=D
