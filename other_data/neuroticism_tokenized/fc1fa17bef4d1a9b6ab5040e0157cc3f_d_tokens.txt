When one door of happiness closes , another opens ; but often we look at the closed door for so long that we do not see the one that has been opened for us . - < PROPFEMALE > Keller

From now until December 7 , change your profile picture to one of your favorite childhood cartoon characters and invite your friends to do the same ! The object of this is to not see any human face on Facebook but an invasion of childhood memories to raise awareness to end Violence Against Children .

After a while you begin to accept defeats with your head up and your eyes open , \ 
with the grace of a woman , not the grief of a child . So , you plant your own garden , and decorate your own soul , instead of waiting for someone to bring you flowers . And you learn that you can endure , that you really are strong and you really do have worth , and that with every new tomorrow comes the < PROPFEMALE > .
