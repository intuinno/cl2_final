having to wake up early on a saturday morning should be illegal . :[ Night , everyone . <3 
School tomorrow . Fun . Off to do homework . 
Getting up ridiculously early in the morning to do a < PROPMALE > & < PROPFEMALE > project sucks . :( 
My computer's all friggen slow from running photoshop all day to do my < PROPMALE > and < PROPFEMALE > packet . But at least it looks cool . :] 
Today sucked , but I hope everyone else had a good day ? :) 
going to the 5 o'clock showing of new < PROPFEMALE > today <3 good luck to everyone going at midnight ! :D

All of this dust in the air needs to settle . My poor grandma can't stop coughing . :(

I just found out I might get pulled out of school . :\\ 
There was an ad on here that had three typos in one sentence xDD 
Starting on Yarbrough's paper . Yawn .

I miss them ... 
The space between my fingers is where yours fit perfectly <3 
Last Full Day Of School !!!!!!!! :DDD 
Sittin at my desk working on study guide packets , drinking a coke through one of those huge twisty straws because I need the caffiene ... Can't wait for break . ? 
finally goin to bed :( 
And so it begins ... I hate finals . :) 
Cobra Starship makes me smile :)) AND HOLY CRAP I PASSED ALL MY FINALS YESTERDAY ! 
For once , I'm not actually detesting the idea of shopping :) To the mall ! ( Wow , that's corny . ) 
Life is good :) I hope everyone else has a good break <3 
Soooo ... Found out yesterday my Grandpa has esophageal cancer . Googled it and found out that the survival rate is little to none ... Praying to God that he makes it . I hope Mom will be okay too ... 
My new year resolution : Try to always look at the bright side of things , stay happy , and be a better person . :) 
Going to the dunes and camping out nearby for new years . I just hope I don't flip this time . ;) 
Homework on the first day back ? What the heck ?! 
If anyone else texted me and is wondering why I didn't reply , I lost my phone charger . Sorry ! :( 
Aaaaaand here are my stats for today . xD # of times fell : > 7 # of times slid : 3 # of times friends had to help me : > million # of splits : 1 during science class But I love the rain and wind :) 
Probably not going to the movies this weekend with < PROPFIRST > . But it's okay . :) At least I'm gonna finish giving my room a makeover ! 
Another has replaced me . And I'm trying not to be bitter about it . If hating me makes her happy , then that makes me feel better . But no matter how hard I try , I can't find a bright side to this situation . I wish I wasn't a coward . :) It'll all be okay in the end though . 
Night everyone <3 
Linkin Park is awesomeeessss . :) 
I wish I could afford a corvette when I'm older . They're such awesome cars :D 
IT'S FRIDAY !! :D

It's official . My presentation for yarbrough sucked haha xD 
Forever . . . ? 
nothing like snuggling in warm sheets fresh from the dryer . . . then waking up hours later and discovering you just slept away your entire second day of spring break . <3 
I love my baby picture !!! xDDD 
* sigh . * :\\ 
' Oooohhhhh Judyyyyyyyyy , why do you have to be soooo gloomyyyyyyyy ? \ Or somethin like that xDD " 
I forgot how much I love spring break . . . Whoever said ' freshman year passes fast ' wasn't friggen lying either . It's already almost OVERRRR ! :) 
' Love is blind , but friendship merely closes its eyes . ' 
So , I was playing with my dog , and ended up getting smacked in the face ( please don't ask how ) AND I TOTALLY THINK I GOT A BLACK EYE . xDDDD 
Wow . Just . . . just , wow . 
Can't WAIT till saturday !! <3 :) <3 
“It takes a minute to have a crush on someone , an hour to like someone and a day to love someone - but it takes a lifetime to forget someone . ” 
result of today's boredom : I HAVE STRAIGHT HAIR . ;D 
Fine . I uploaded a picture of me w/ straight hair . :P 
If anyone sees those weird ' You Tube ' links , don't open it , it's a virus . Someone sent it to me and it infected my computer , and it's randomly sending it to people , so if you get it from me , don't open it . :( 
AGAIN . A VIRUS HACKED MY ACCOUNT AND SENT A LINK TO PEOPLE THROUGH A PRIVATE MESSAGE . IT EITHER SAYS YOUTUBE OR SOMETHING ABOUT A ' VLOG . ' DON'T OPEN IT . IT'S THE VIRUS . 
I thought I was over it . Guess not . :) 
The ending to ac2 SUCKS . D: 
\I know it was my fault . I know I screwed up . I know I'm being unreasonable . But I also know that I want you back . \ " <3 " 
* sigh * Going to the movies today . Break's almost over . I'm caught between being happy and sad about that . :/ 
I've spent the last 3 hours drawing D: There are pencil smudges everywhere , and I have a LOVELY hand cramp . But it's a good work in progress at least . <3 
What's with that formspring thing that a bunch if people are doing ? 
Fine . I'll RE-STRAIGHTEN my hair for school tomorrow since a bunch of people apparently want me to . D: 
The fricken drama in high school man xDD Guess what ? In five years , NO ONE WILL CARE . 
Hair is now straight . :) 3 HOURS WTF . 
Can't wait for festival tomorrow !!!!! :)) 
Ah , the joy of getting to miss all of my work classes tomorrow . Life's goooood . :) 
Happy Easter ! ;D 
I love my idiot friends . Especially when they plot their revenge on each other by taking the pencil sharpener off the wall and throwing lead and shavings while the teacher is in her the office . His face was BLACK by the time Reynolds came into the room xDD 
I just got one of those hyper urges to scream loudly so I can hear an echooo . I know I'm strange . ;) 
I yelled at a bird that was right outside my window to shut up and I think I scared this little kid . <3 ;) World's Best Neighbor strikes again ! ~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~ ! 
Had a bunch of strawberriesss . :) <3 
I made my first page ~ ~ :D 
Very tired . Gonna sleep the rest of the day then sleep all day tomorrow . Laters . ;P 
Going to bed early . And it's Friday . I'm tired , so I don't care if I don't have a life right now . BLEH . ;P 
There's a cat . Across the street . And all three of my dogs just HAPPENED to see it . Joy . :) 
The Last Song looks like a really cute movie ... eeeeeexcept it has miley < PROPMALE > in it . But if people tell me it's as good as it looks , I'll give it a shot . :) 
six more weeks left !! :D 
Well . Today sucked . ;/ 
Bubble wrap is strangely entertaining . 
Why are a bunch of people moving to Colorado ? EXCEPT ME ?! :( 
Yay ~ ~ I'm getting closer and closer to getting my first thousand fans for my < PROPFEMALE > ! <3 :D 
Changeling is one of the saddest movies I've ever seen . :( 
Translating Shakespeare is sooo much fun . Oh well , at least my group is okay with me not typing in exchange . :) 
< PROPFEMALE > eyes are so pretty ! * jealous * :) 
This week's going by fast for me :) 
PISSED !!!!!! :/ 
My crappy day just got better ! Got my first thousand fans !! :DD 
Ahhhh , two whole days of no drama . :) 
Bought Avatar . It is STILL one of the most awesome movies in my opinion . :) 
\Utter your words of meaning clearly . Ignore the whispers of temptation and false paradise . Conquer your deceptions . Nothing is true . \"" 
Should I straighten my hair tomorrow ? Can't decide . :\\ 
My mom saw the new eclipse trailor and squeeled/gasped like a teenager xDD 
\Cry and your friends will cry with you . Laugh and the world will laugh with you . \ " -Whoever made it up . :) " 
Most people remember people by one thing or memory :) Comment yours for me then copy and paste this to your status to see how people remember you :) 
Half day tomorrow ! ~ ~ ;D 
Great . I think my allergies are starting to get to me . Putting it together with today's sudden nausea and this friggen MIGRAINE , everything's just awesome . At least everything else today was good . :) 
The only good thing about today was that it ended quickly . * sigh * :/ 
\Empty words . Promising lies . We make these contradictions possible . I expect the let down . I try to except the excuses . It's an endless cycle . And I'm ending it now . \"" 
It's times like these I wish I was a stronger person :( 
Wow . Macbeth is kind of sad/disturbing . o-o 
15 more days , including today and half days :D 
Wow . I think my heart actually just broke a little ... 
Went to my first concert today ! Addison Road was AWESOME . :D 
Happy mother's day to all the moms ! You guys deserve it ! <3 
Got scared really badly . :( Was drying and brushing my hair from the shower and when I looked in the mirror I saw blood in my hair . Cue panic attack . 
Not looking forward to disecting a frog tomorrow . :( How steriotypical of highschool biology . 
I'm thinking about getting a Formspring . I'm curious to see what people think of me since I don't talk much in school ... 
11 !!!!!! :D 
Wow . This guy in this video I watched threw a tantrum like a friggen crazy DEVIL CHILD . o-o 
\Silence is sobering . \"" 
Went to ealmart earlier and took only five seconds out of my day to move some shopping carts that were blocking some handicap parking spots . People are really starting to become inconsiderate and lazy nowadays ... :\\ 
Last night was awesommeee . :D 
Had so many blonde moments today it isn't funny . xD And my ankle's already feeling better . I told my friends they didn't need to worry about it ! :) 
Wow . It's kind of stupid when staying in an honors class means doing assignments over summer VACATION . :\\ And I'm not going to even go into how hellish the rest of today was . Hope everyone else had a good one though . :) 
The choir concert last night was okay for our last one of the year I guess . At least the audience seemed to like it . And Bryttany < PROPMALE > gave me and some other girls roses cause she's awesome ! :) 
That < PROPFIRST > dude off of American Idol is cuuute !!! And he's got a voice ! <3 
Somehow , I found a way to bruise a finger without remembering what I did . 
Ahhh , today was our last day as freshman !! :D 
Just got home from the Meet of Champions , and it was awesome !! :) I even got to help out a little with the pole-vaulting ! 
Aw GROSS . My finger got stuck in a huge wad of gum . :S 
Sooo ... Choir final : Got a SUPER easy part to sing ! :) But then panicked and messed up ... Weights final : EASY . ;D Math final : forgot trigonometric ratios , but then remembered and it was also EASY . :D All my hard finals are tomorrow ... Then summer's here ! <3 
Wow , I thought for sure < PROPFEMALE > would win . Oh well , < PROPFIRST > deserved to win it too . Congrats to him ! :) 
IT'S OVER . I'm going to miss everyone sooo much ! <3 And thanks Jausia Baltazar , you made my shirt look a bazillion times better . ;D 
Wow , there's adults outside playing with one of those kid's rubberish bouncy balls . It's weird yet awesome at the same time . :) And as I'm typing this , one of the dudes just kicked it into our neighbor's backyard across the street xDD 
In a really bittersweet situation right now . Leaving for Colorado early ( yay ! ) , but only because my grandpa's in the hospital again :( I hope someday we'll be rid of this devil disease called cancer . I'll be out of touch from computer for six or seven weeks , so text or call me at 480-259-9969 . Hopefully everything goes well ... 
Well , my grandpa is officially on his deathbed . Last time I saw him was yesterday , sleeping , and I kissed him on the forehead and told him goodbye . I didn't know that would be my last goodbye , but I guess it has to suffice . I know that when it's all over , he'll be in a better place . I cannot be selfish and ask for anymore time with him , but I hope he knows how much I will love and miss him . 
Yayy haha , I won ;o 
I hate rap , but Eminem's starting to rub off on me a little bit . Have his song stuck in my head .. ;o 
bleh . <3 
I really should upload another picture on here . It's rather irksome to keep seeing that profile-head-thing every time I come on here haha :) 
Had my first Chipotle thing today .. Them burritos are HUUUGE . 
The rain last night was awesome !!!! And now our pool is flooded .. <3 
I've recently discovered that burning your hand on a hair iron isn't pleasant . Not at all , really . :) 
Wow . I know she hates me and everything , but you know what sucks ? Since she was my best friend , she knows all of my weaknesses . She knows exactly what to say to make me crumble . And I know the same about her . Yet I don't talk crap about her . Not even once . Funny how these things work . 
Hmmmm , I think I'm done with this whole drama-fest thing . I started some of it , so now I'm going to end my portion and not care anymore . Just remember that you told me you hated liars and hypocrites : you're both , so kindly get over yourself . Do us both a big favor . :) 
My poor mama ... We have smart dudes at our school ; anyone invent the cure for the common cold yet ? 
Do I have homework ? Yup . Am I doing it yet ? Nope . 
Yessss . Thank goodness it's Friday :D 
Well , today was ah-mazingggg . Danced out in the rain with the guys , had an awesome BBQ , jammed out to good ol ' classic rock , and laughed at the ridiculousness that is my awesome family . <3 <3 <3 
Oh no , I have a profile picture again . That means something horrible is going to happen . Like inflicted blindness . <3 
Can't wait for three day weekend haha , just one more day of school :) 
well , crap . 
Hmm , courtesy of < PROPFEMALE > Aliyah Bryson , I've been told to ' go die ' in Romanian bahahaha :) 
There goes a good mood . I love how I accidentally ruin things sometimes . :) 
\There always comes a time in your life where you never feel more loved ... And never more hated . \"" 
Things have to get better . They always do . <3 
Since tomorrow's Tuesday , we're gonna have advisory aren't we ... Ugh . 
Keep on smiling , sunshine . Keep on laughing , love ; your happiness is mine . <3 
Wow .. I think I'm feeling heartache for the first time .. 
Personal lesson learned : If you're paranoid about something , don't ignore it . You forgot something important . Oh my heckkkk . 
I've never been so indecisive about someone before . It's getting out of hand , and I don't know what to do . :( 
At least the week's almost over 
Yay , got my phone fixed ! <3 
41 more minutes , and it'll be 9/11 ... 
Everyone please give some prayer and respect to those who passed away nine years ago . We Will Never Forget . 
I watched the VMA's just to see Linkin Park perform . My throat hurts from actually squeeling . What a nerd . :) 
Yes . I really , really want to type an essay that's due tomorrow . Really , I do . 
Best day of school so far . So happy right now ! <3 <3 <3 
Goodness , Sunday came way too soon . It should definitely be fall break tomorrow instead of a bazillion weeks from now . :) 
Today sucked , but that just means that tomorrow has got to be better . :) 
Hope everyone had fun at homecoming !! :) 
I love it when you have to sit next to a bunch of people you don't know in class , but then they end up having the most hilarious conversations ever . My chemistry class is definitely interesting . :) 
Today was crappy yet awesome at the same time . Go figure . :) 
Choir concert tonight ! Bleh . Hopefully , it will be amazing . :) 
Festival today went well , our CD sounds awesome compared to the concert last night !!! :) \ 
..... aaand then I went and busted up my knee and ankle . Life isn't complete without having a clutz moment to end the day . <3 
For the inner math nerd in people : 9x - 7i < 3(3x - 7u ) . :) 
So , it's pretty much impossible to sleep comfortably with a twisted ankle and banged-up knee , I have discovered . Oh well , it'll get better at least . :) 
I love how parents just have the magical ability to make things VERY awkward for their kids hahahahahaha <3 
Lost my phone . Crap . D: 
Oh goodness , WE HAVE RAIN . Miracle . :D 
SO HAPPY !! <3 
Dentist yay ? 
Break needs to stop ending . :( 
Really really really really ticked off right now . At least the Broncos are winning !! 
Maybe staying up till six this morning wasn't the brightest idea , seeing as how I actually need to sleep on schedule again . Crap . 
Aaaand it starts again . <3 
My sister is such a dork , but I love her to death . (: 
Got so focused on making my poem for english look pretty that I lost track of time and haven't even started math yet . That's what I get for making the extra effort . This sucks haha . Night everyone else . (: 
Friday AND my best friend's birthday ???? Today is gonna be awesome ! :) 
Feel like drawing . Any ideas ? 
Wow , today was a really good day . I absolutely adore my friends . (: <3 
Doesn't it always seem like you log on and that one person you want to talk to isn't ? Haha oh well , nothing can ruin this bad mood right now . So happy <3 
This week went by fast ... 
Got my costume ... Found my i-Pod ... Everything's all goooood . (: Except wigs . Wigs apparently hate me and my uncontainable hair . <3 
Hm , I wonder how many people are gonna go ridiculous all-out today for the sake of ' possibly ' getting on tv ? Forget that haha , I'm just gonna dress normal and enjoy the show . (: 
Excited , tonight is gonna be so much fun ! (: 
Family is happy . Friends are happy . I am happy . Life is good . <3 
Oh mother ... I decide that for once I wouldn't procrastinate on a project and laid out everything I would need later . Got everything done , just need the poster . I come home , and it's in the garbage . Oh , lovely . (: 
Loving how it almost reached ninety the other day and now it's so cold my fingers are numb when I wake up . <3 
Happy Veteran's Day . Thank you , all the brave people who risk everything in order to give us everything . :) 
I hate annotations . And I hate the book we have to annotate . 
Hear the music of a lullaby of which you mustn't fall asleep to ... Thy deadly dreams contain songs of perish ; sweet nightmares of unfufillment . 
I've been so swamped with homework . Two hours of sleep , and sadly , that's a rather generous amount . If I listen closely , I can hear my grades screaming . Dad's birthday tomorrow though , so I'll smile just for him . He deserves it . :) 
Yes , going out ! Tonight is going to be fun , and we are going to give Dad an awesome birthday ! <3 
Fun day , fun night ... <3 
So I've become aware that 90% of facebook is excited for that < PROPMALE > Potter movie thing ? 
Holy efff . I actually got all my homework done ? In one night ? Without losing any sleep ??? Something is amiss here . 
Why watch shows like Jersey Shore ? There's plenty of drama on here . 
RAIN . WE ARE GOING OUTSIDE NOW . :) 
Not ready for school . Am ready for short break . 
I adore those moments where you swear to yourself you will get homework done . Then you get a text . Then you get a notification on Facebook . Then you stare at the paper until you get another text or notification . Let's check progress : Blank < PROPFEMALE > , and an hour has passed . \ 
Watch out , progress is being made . 
My dog acts like a cat . :) 
Happy Thanksgiving ! I'm very blessed to have the life that I have , and I should show gratitude more often . I love my friends and family , and I hope everyone has a great day . (: 
Dreading shopping ... Kill me now , or the crazy mobs of people will . 
Hyper out of my mind and probably getting no sleep tonight . <3 Hope everyone had a nice Black Friday ; I'm not gonna lie , I'm glad I didn't go . (: 
Oh my . 
Walked through the door and Grandma was watching some animal police show on animal planet . The first five seconds I laid eyes on the screen , I saw a puppy that looked like it had been tortured and my heart broke . Animal abusers belong in Hell , if you ask me . :\\ 
Homework ? Reviews ? Finals ...? What's that ? 
We have two half days next week right ...? Yay . (: 
Having discussions with parents about medical complications is not fun , I've found out . 
I hate finals . At least I still managed all A's and a B . Sigh . 
Am I the only one noticing all the new single-status updates ? Six days before Christmas ...? That's sad ... :( \ 
( And to people who this applies , sorry . Not meaning to rub salt in fresh wounds . Just an observation . ) 
I thought < PROPFIRST > Swift was like , eighteen or something . 
Nothing like being sick and having to skip movies and Christmas Service ... Sigh . 
Christmas < PROPFEMALE > <3 :) 
Procrastinating on multiple things at once . Does that mean I'm multitasking ? Let's just be safe and go with lazy . 
Tonight is going to suck . But at least it's Friday <3 :) 
I'm 95% sure I now have whatever Mrs. Reynolds had or has or whatever . I already sound like a gremlin . 
Feeling SO much better :) 
Ehhh , not feeling too well , and worried about certain people also not feeling too well ... But today was still a good day . :) 
Poking war with my sister and < PROPMALE > . Oh goodness . 
I was all laughing at a friend who almost fell , then I turn around and run into a door ... < PROPFEMALE > loves me . 
Never thought I'd say I'd be dreading the weekend ... 
How do you know if your best is really enough ...? 
Getting to work right about now ... Which means my paper won't get done till around midnight or something . I tend to procrastinate . 
Even when I'm told I'm not enough , at least I know I tried . That's more then what could be said for some people , I suppose . 
Half day and a 100% on my permit test : Pretty good . (: \ 
Special day tomorrow <3 
Gah , couldn't get a new phone today . I'm pretty sure I was jinxed . 
I don't really know what to do anymore . Just go with the flow I guess . I want to make everyone happy , but how can I ? 
You think you get used to something , be it a feeling or situation . Then it turns around and slaps you in the face . 
My early birthday present is pretty freaking amazing . (: \ 
Thank you Momma ! 
I love getting yelled at by random strangers . It just adds to my Friday . :D 
The PowerPoint I should have finished hours ago final got sent . Now onto writing my entire paper over the weekend ! :D 
Everyone support the people of < PROPFEMALE > by going to the final show tonight ! :) 
I don't feel like I'm going to be sixteen tomorrow . :o 
Thank you everyone for the birthday wishes ; today was already amazing , but each birthday wish made today even better . You're all wonderful . :) 
So . I fell UP the stairs yesterday . And now my foot is sore . :) 
Wow . I'm actually letting my friends drag me to the mall today . Oh goodness .. :) \ 
And for anyone who's seen Red Riding Hood : is it good ? 
No one will get this right ! My middle name__________ , my age___ my favorite soda_______ , my full birthday___/___/___ , who's the love of my life______ , my best friend_____ , my favorite color______ , my eye color_______ , my hair color______ my favorite food________and my moms name__________ !!! Put this as your status and see who knows you best ! \ 
I'm curious haha , who knows this much about me ? 
People are idiots . It's shocking to realize just how un-common ' common courtesy ' is anymore . 
Alriiiiiight . Still need to annotate anywhere from 130-140 pages . Did mini-notebook paper thing , whatever . Do any of my peers know what the approximate measurments of the poster should be ? I halfed it like she told us to , but I'm paranoid . 
\What was close now seems to be worlds apart . \"" 
\WWIII will last approximately twenty-seven minutes . WWIV will be fought with sticks and rocks by the idiots who survived the radiation from WWIII . It will probably be over the last irradiated cow . \ " - Mr. < PROPFEMALE >." 
Hairspray was amazing !!! So many talented and wonderful people ; I'm so glad my friends convinced me to go . Everyone go to the final showing Monday night !!!

I love it how everyone irritates you , even though they don't mean too . I love it when you only want to talk to one person , yet they could care less .
