work ... twas a good first night back in Bro-cine .

i am consumed with the need to be happy . i obsess on the things that help me relax . i pour my heart into my friendships . so they will always be there for me . work is not my priority . money is just a thing . the thing i treasure , the thing i love , are the people around me , all my friends and whoevers left in this town . 
so now i proclaim to everyone . if you're going to live , do it now . you are not guaranteed to wake up in the morning or see your bed at night . nobody can promise you one last < PROPMALE > to do anything . there are only so many tomorrows . life is short and time is precious , and for the sake of living to fulfillment , don't waste it . \
