Lyrics stuck in my head :\ 
\ 
One day we'll look back laughin\ 
At the week we brought her home\ 
This phase is gonna fly by\ 
So baby just hold on\ 
Cause it wont be like this for long\ 
Just watchin her it breaks his heart\ 
Cause he already knows\ 
It wont be like this for long\ 
One day soon that little girl is gonna be\ 
All grown up & gone\ 
Yeah this phase is gonna fly by\ 
So hes tryin to hold on\ 
Cause it won’t be like this for long 

The baby is sleeping sound but I cant seem to fall asleep and stay alseep ... I knew having a baby would be hard work ( but worth it ) - what I didnt expect is how a < PROPFEMALE > , new person can keep you busy , BUSY , busy ! 
Watching \Teen Mom\ " on mtv.com Join me in chat : http://soc.li/AAYPweG " 
I just posted 3 new pictures of < PROPMALE > ! They are so damn cute its awful ! 
I don't get it ! How can such a relatively small amount ( formula and/or breast milk ) go into a baby and such a large amount ( talkin ' about baby poop ! ) come out of the same baby ? \ 
' What goes up must come down ' I learned in school . ' What goes in must come out ' I learned well within days of my sons birth . Both make sense ... BUT how can 6 ounces go in and a whole lot more end up coming out ? 
< PROPFIRST > has refused to eat several times which is NOtheT him at all ! He got 3 shots on Mon and I was expecting some of whats going on but he is feeling FAR more miserable than I had expected . 
Anyone with more ' mommy experience ' than my 13 weeks know how long I can expect this to go on ? Any recommendations ( or warnings ) about Bangor area pediatricians ? I havent liked his current Dr since just minutes into meeting for the first time ... no disrespect meant but I need to feel comfortable with and have overall generally positive visits , interactions , etc and the current one is ... well , not those things . 
< PROPMALE > BEAR lyrics “I love to rub his chubby tummy\ 
And hug his rolly < PROPFEMALE > body\ 
When < PROPMALE > cuddles close beside me\ 
We always make each other happy\ 
And when I toss him high above me\ 
And catch him gently as a feather\ 
I can almost hear his laughter\ 
So glad that we can be together” 
Something I would never have imagined ever saying in my lifetime : “Please don’t suck on your dirty diaper ! ” My little man is 15 weeks old today - where has the time gone ? 
I am 100% sure that < PROPMALE > said his first real word today ! Lately I have thought his babbles have sounded like ' < PROPFEMALE>' and sometimes ' < PROPFEMALE>-<PROPFEMALE>' but its early for that so I couldn’t fully believe it was really more than a coincidence BUT he said “ < PROPFEMALE >-< PROPFEMALE > ” FOR SURE today and more than once ! I wasn’t the only one to hear it so I really know it isn’t just the i < PROPFEMALE > gination of an overly proud , in love head-over-heels mom !! 
* Warning : Insomniac Venting * I don’t understand how a man could know they fathered a child & not care the slightest bit . Never wanting to meet or know about the child not even being curious enough to want a picture . Putting effort into denying and avoiding everything . Anyone , especially the guys reading this , have any thoughts or insights or anything on this ? 
Going on 4am and I havent been able to sleep ' cuz of a horrible toothache - if I had a pair of pliers I think I might just be capable of using them to pull the damned tooth ! 
Can anyone help me ? There are codes on all coke product caps which I’ve been collecting but am running out of time to get what Id like to be my Nanas xmas present . I would be REALLY grateful if anyone sends me even one code please ! 
I had an appointment in Bangor so I got < PROPMALE > all bundled up and in his infant car seat/carrier then locked up and headed outside . The minute < PROPMALE > saw the snow that was covering everything ( and still coming down ) he started crying . A kid after my own heart ! 
Must be genetic ! My little man dislikes mornings as much as I do ! 
Ok , I am not too great with computers and the like so I could use some suggestions . I have a LOT of movies , full seasons of several tv series , etc video files which are 95% AVI format & a good amount of audio files mostly in MP3 format ... I want to transfer them onto a storage ' whatever ' so I can delete off my laptop . What would be best to use ? DVD ? Flash drive ? Suggestions anyone ? Thanks 
ANOTHER MILESTONE ! I had < PROPFIRST > in my lap while sittiing on the floor infront of the coffee table when he reached out with both hands and stood up using his hands for the minimal amount on balance he neeed . Shocked ! 6 months old today , too ! 
Anyone else seen ' The Black Swan' ? Hollywood , media , etc made such commotion about the film being deserving of an < PROPFIRST > ( or whatever award ) that I watched it . Maybe its just me but I dont understand how its supposed to be so great . 
Anyone have experience or knowledge about Consumer Cellular ?? I am contemplating getting service through them - plans , price , etc great fit for me but I am hesitant given that I know nothing about Consumer Cellular other than what is on their website .

I KNOW ! I know I know I Know what < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFEMALE > are having and while it was worth waiting up this late I am now off to bed ... ha , 9pm was never ' late ' before my crash course into motherhood ! 
Anyone want to do something nice and help make my day ? I have been collecting the codes from Coke products caps but still am short of the total I need to get the reward I have been working towards BUT I still need a good amount to points to get the reward ( prize ) I want from MyCokeRewards.com ... prettly please ? 
Anyone with experience have a suggestion ? < PROPMALE > is 8 months & has recently taken to making ' poop < PROPMALE>' at night . I end up with a stinky , messy , couldn’t-be-too-healthy mess in the morning . Only thing that worked a little has been putting the bugger to bed in 1 piece sleep-n-plays so he doesn’t have easy diaper access . Getting him into them NOT easy and hasn’t even fully stopped him . 
I am NOT seeing things ! A few nights lately I had told myself that being tired , etc was the explanation for the movement I * thought * I saw out of the corner of my eye . Makes sense and what could really make such brief , fast , etc appurtenances and be gone before I could really get a look ? Well , A MOUSE ! That is what it was and I got proof tonight . I need to get back to looking for a kitten/young cat to adopt ! 
So ready for spring ... 
Any of you out there with small children still in diapers use Pampers brand ( both the diapers themselves and also wipes ) not use the codes for Gifts to Grow ? If so would you be kind enough to send any you might have around my way ?? :) 
An idea : Contribute outgrown clothes/toys to be added to outgrown items from other parents . Sizes , etc currently needed for baby/child would be sent in return for items you donate to the ‘collection’ . If there were enough parents interested in doing this then I think it could work wonderfully AND save a lot of money . Feedback ? Interested in participating ? 
Does anyone know if , here in the state of Maine , a person must posses a valid ( not expired ) license in order to ( re)register their vehicle ?
