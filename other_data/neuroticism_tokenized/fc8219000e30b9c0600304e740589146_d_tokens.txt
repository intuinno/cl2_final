Today's ridiculous thing you can find at my library/work : Crossroads in Danish .

today I learned : never go to work for the day without bringing food . 
new experiences : walking to a party in downpour -> hitch hiking + mini gherkins . 
will Not go into either savings account . I will not go into my savings . I will not go into my savings .

what do you do when it's too hot out for anything fun ? use that to your advantage in convincing the men workin outside with mullets that they should get a hair cut on break to help keep cooler . 
< PROPFIRST > Klukow will be Here in 8ish hours !! 
+ < PROPFIRST > Klukow = one of the greatest ideas . definitely need to schedule as frequent of visits as possible . 
yesterday was an epic day for shopping & life with < PROPFIRST > Klukow + today I get to see my brother + then everyone comes back to oxford = so good . 
having the entrance to a bar thru a short fence is only encouraging your patrons to roll over it on the way in/out & continue to roll on the ground ... potentially face first .
