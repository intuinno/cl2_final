Fed up . Bring it . Dig it for yourself 
In the Desert by < PROPFIRST > Crane In the desert I saw a creature , \ 
naked , bestial , Who , squatting\ 
upon the ground , Held his heart in\ 
his hands , And ate of it . I said , ' Is it\ 
good , friend ? ' ' It is bitter -- \ 
bitter , ' he answered , ‘But I like it Because it is\ 
bitter , And because it is\ 
my heart . ’ 
just am right now 
Alive , kinda . Hopes for the future . decisions to make . 
I hope so ^.^ I am glad I did to my friend 
Alive , kinda . Hopes for the future . decisions to make 
Half the fun is to plan the plan ^.^ and it is planned

One more night and one more time .. ( finish the lyric ? )

Happy birthday mom . R.I.P. 
Yesterday upon the stair , I met a little man who wasn't there 
He wasn't there again today , oh how I wish he'd go away ... 
Needs to make a hard decision , one way sucks but could mean I get to see fili alot more . The other way things stay the same
