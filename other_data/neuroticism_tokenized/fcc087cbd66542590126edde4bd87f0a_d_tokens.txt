Is at Dairy < PROPFEMALE > with the best and most amazing woman on the planet !! :) :) :) 

If any body has a PSN gamer tag Mine is ihaveatransam79 add me 
Found out she was single again asked her the question all i got was \I like you as a friend right now . \ " \ " you're like my best friend . \ " I'm depressed and confused . " 
It hit me like a brick I just want her as a friend anything more wold only hurt us :>) 
Feelin good . . . just bored . 
Another weekend gone with very little accomplished . . . sigh 
Filled up with E-85 Fri . Helpin those farmers and the environment . . . oh and it's 50 cents cheeper than gasoline : ) 
Finally got the motor out of my car ! yay ! 
\I'm happier than a tornada in a trailer park ! \"" 
has found a wonderful person 
can't wait to come face to face with his dream 
has been captured by an angel and couldn't be happier :) 
Absolutly the best most exciting , fun , and wonderful day I have ever had made possible by possibly the most wonderful girl in the universe ! 
used to think that nothing could be more beautiful than the < PROPFEMALE > s on a clear night out in the country , but then I went to Iowa City and found a < PROPFEMALE > so bright it put the others to shame :) 
absolutely loves the way he has been feeling since March 21st 
played rockband 2 for a wile today downloaded some more songs for it played trough Monster by Skillet on expert guitar 99% notes hit and 5 gold stars :) not a really difficult song but I did it for someone special :) 
can't wait ' till around 10 tonight cause I get to talk to my lovely gf . . . baby I'm amazed by you :) 
is tired of having bad days at work 
\All that i'm after is a life full of laughter as long as I'm laughin with you\ " :) " 
wishes he had a certain someone close by his side tonight . . . he needs a hug . . . 
Needs his motor to be done already . . . Come on ! >:( 
thinks that he will never feel terrible again ! :) 
Time in one instant may move slow and in another fast , but no matter how its moving the time spent knowing someone loves you is always at a stand still so you may hold onto the moment forever :) 
So I finally get to see the engine for my car on saturday ! It's complete and ready to pick up :) can't wait for the fun of ordering more parts and dropping that beast back in its home ! 
I've been away for so long . I miss her soooo \ 
much . I never thought that love could make you feel bad and depressed as\ 
much as this . I will survive though because I know I will always be \ 
welcome back home in your arms ? 
is at a loss for what he should do on his day off tomorrow ... parts should be coming for the car but not really any I can use right away ... hmmmm I guess I'll just have to wait untill I see what the day brings 
Had a great day today ! Feeling good and enjoying the thoughts of the future ! :) 
was kinda enjoying the middle 60's :( oh well at least i can still enjoy the 60's at night while looking at the stars :) alas the stars remind me of someone and I miss her a lot ... so though I can enjoy the temp I see not stars but a pretty face a pretty smile and a beautiful personality they shine brighter than the sun , and though I miss her I know she is locked away safe in my mind and every beat of my heart :) 
Should leave for work right about now but is super tired couldn't sleep :( ok I'm leaving ugh 
Got off work early and turned his day into a lazy , carefree , feeling better about himself , rearranging his room , listening to music , watching a < PROPMALE > Urban concert on DVD , drinking a milkshake , and thinking about his girl kind of day . :) Awesome 
Feels great this morning ! Got the day off and maybe have some more parts coming in today for the car . Gonna clean and repaint the air cleaner today and get some 800 grit sandpaper maybe get the rims worked on . :) 
\Love is unstoppable ! \ " \ 
has a huge craving for a hug or a kiss or both from his wonderful far off < PROPFEMALE > ! :) I miss you 
continued ... we will all enjoy the rain that comes falling ; a cooling sensation and a\ 
symphony of sorts ; the rain steals the heat and the thiunder reports ; \ 
the lighning flashes and lights up the sky ; a simple yet astonishing \ 
treat for the eye ; summer is gone now it left in a hurry ; I think in the\ 
distance I see a flurry :P 
Feel the breeze on a warm early summers day ; the stress of life seems to\ 
fade away ; birds in the distance chirping so happily ; It seems a good \ 
day to be outside with family ; activities of summer so blissful and \ 
freeing ; all that is done seems to come like breathing ; off in the \ 
distance a storm is brewing ; 
Had a great day yesterday working on the car , texting my awesome gf , and going fishing . Let's hope I can do just as well today :) 
Had another great day ! Chatting with the most amazing gf throughout the day , went to my brothers graduation ceremony , had some most amazing newyork cheesecake pancakes and iced coffee at IHOP , and got some things accomplished on the car . :) 
had a fairly boring day . Gave Netflix on the Wii a good workout haha and got the motor mounts put back on the engine . A big plus is that I got paid to do all that today :) 
Off work early now for some wrenchin on the car :) ... but first lunch haha 
got some astronaut ice cream from Amazon and a little gift for my sweetheart today :) got the exhaust mocked up on the car and did a little gaming . All the wile missing that wonderful girl . I will see you soon my love <3 
is sooooooooooo ready for next weekend to get here !!!!!! Come on time move faster !!! :) 
KFC : \Would you like some cookies for only $ . 99 ? \ " \ 
Was on a forklift for six and a half hours and got a pretty mean sunburn ... Oh well it was fun :) 
Haha still more parts coming from summit racing tomorrow ! Yay ! Sadly not the flywheel that I so deperately need to actually put the engine IN the car ugh :( the summer wastes away and no car to go out and play ! Classic cars out enjoying the weather wile mine sits in a garage < PROPFIRST > as ever ! Oh please please make my flywheel come so I can hit the road and have some fun ! 
As the rain of a summer storm makes a soothing sound outside ; I sit and think about how I like the rain . The rain is peaceful ; the rain is cooling ; the rain brings beauty . The rain brings me closer to you . 
Just got an email from summit racing- we just wanted to let you know that we shipped your recent order \ 
Part # CTF-700610 . FLYWHEEL . 374.95 \ 
:) HELL YEAH !!!!!!!! 
Thinks it's strange that the past couple days he hasn't set his alam clock , but has been waking up early on his own ... huh ... 
Boo summit racing ! How do you idiots send me back the same ford fuel pump that I sent back to you ? I NEED A PONTIAC ONE >:( \ 
Come on did you not even open the box when you got it back ? 
Spent an amazing weekend with an amazing girl :) \ 
Time , it's a crazy thing . When having fun it's fast and vise versa . This weekend however was different . I was having fun but time was nearly motionless .. though the clock says different . But spending time with the one I love is amazing it's like having my own little time pod . One that only she and I can be in , and that is an amazing feeling . 
So the flywheel I ordered and waited for is wrong because the crankshaft that was used to rebuild my engine is from an older motor around a 76 or earlier . I ordered one for a 79 . The crankshaft register is 2.75 inches on my crank and the flywheel I have measures 2.49 inches . So oh well at least the flywheel I actually need is not backordered . Back to summit you go along with that FORD fuel pump ! 
5 A.M. Comes too fast :( \ 
I wish I had you here ; I wish that you were near ; I wish that I could've seen that beautiful face ; that would've made my heart race ; to see you in the morning ; to have you next to me smiling ; ah a kiss and a hug goodbye ; a friendly \have a good day\ " ... sigh ; I miss you in the morning light ; a morning without you just doesn't seem right . " 
Correct flywheel coming tomorrow :) maybe if it comes early enough in the day I can get the engine back in the car . 
Got the motor back in the car after a good , long fight . This car just doesn't like me ... never has , and probably never will . But I don't care how much it fights me it will be driven again !! 
And the sun shines and temperature rises ; mother nature is just full of surprises ; I wish for rain but at the same time welcome the sun ; out in the sun we can have some fun ; the rain is calming and cooling to the touch ; but even the rain gets old after so much ; thunder I will miss and lightning is quite a spectacle ; if the sun , thunder , and lightning existed together it would be quite incredible 
Yay a whole day tomorrow to work on the car ! Possibly help a friend install his car stereo too :) 
Got the exhaust all done and the radiator installed . I hope to have the car done by this weekend :) I had a good day . I got the most wonderful surprise in the mail ! A card from my love ! :) it brought about a wonderful happiness from deep inside . It made me cry tears of joy . A card with sound ... a wonderful \I love you\ " and a perfect song by Lonestar . Thank you so much hun ! Love you babe ! <3 " 
Is going to give summit one more < PROPMALE > at giving me the right fuel pump- only because ordering one from an auto parts store will take too long-I even paid for next day delivery , so the moment of truth for summit keeping a customer will be tomorrow . Then if it is the right one we should be hearing a monster come to life later tomorrow night :) 
Got the car running but the engine has an exhaust leak at the intake manifold . Can I get a break ? Please !? Now I have to call auto < PROPMALE>'s cuz they messed up ugh !!! The good thing is the engine runs very well !!! I haven't even tuned the carburetor or adjusted the timing yet , and it still runs , sounds , turns over , starts , and looks better than it ever did before :) 
Is gonna have the new best weekend of his life !!! 
Awesome weekend !!!! :) you are amazing love <3 
Loves driving his car but wishes it would stop fighting him . I can't wait for it to be perfect so I can cruise with my beautiful , wonderful , amazing girlfriend !! :) 
got his new computer finished !!! \ 
New computer's stats : AMD Phenom II X4 at 3.4 Ghz -- MSI SLI ready motherboard with Nvidia Nforce 980-G65 chip -- 8 GB Corsair Dominator DDR3 dual channel RAM 1333 Mhz --- Nvidia GTX 260 OC graphics card with 898 MB ram -- 850 watt Antec power supply -- LG blu-ray player/burner -- Hitachi CD/DVD burner -- card reader -- 480GB HDD -- Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit -- 8 fans 
The days go by ; I'm almost getting tired of being this guy ; the kindness I show , the generosity I bestow ; never appreciated you know ? ; why are people so rude and disrespectful ? ; I'd like to be vengeful ; I'd like to say go to hell ; how do I hold back so well ; I do nothing , I won't change ever ; I like me too much I'll stay like this forever ! ; so nice try all you people you can't win ! ; I'll just say hi and smile again ! 
:) 
Just found out what it's like eating McNuggets and dipping them in BBQ sauce wile driving ... it's not too bad ... didn't even get any BBQ on me :) oh ! and a frappé to go with it delicious ! 
Thinks it's pretty entertaining to watch the cone of a speaker vibrate and bounce as it produces the wonderful sound and beat of music ! :) 
Thank you all so much for the birthday wishes !! :) 
\Time spent wishing ... is time wasted . \"" 
Starts working at the Kewanee Menards on Sunday ... Not really that excited about it ... glad its only for a month :) 
First night working in Kewanee .... 12.5 hours put up block display similar to the moline store 
With open arms I embrace the day ; I wouldn't have it any other way ; the day is mine ; I'm gonna do what I can to make it shine ; I'm gonna smile a little more ; I'm gonna laugh till my sides are sore ; I'm gonna dream of days to come ; I'm gonna give a lot and only take some ; I'm gonna let the day shine ; the day is mine ! 
has the most amazing , wonderful , astonishing , sexy , beautiful , enticing , caring , talented , understanding , smart , loving , and all around perfect girlfriend in the entire world 
Loves Ange Cox with all his heart and soul <3 
If I had a dollar for every second I spent missing my girlfriend when we're apart I'd make $ 86,400 a day

I'm head over heels ; I love how this feels ; in love with a girl who is perfect oh yes ; she will deny it but she IS nonetheless ; hello undeniable love of my dreams ; I'm unconditionally yours no matter how life careens ; in good times and bad when happy or sad ; I'll always be there and never just a tad ... \

Is sick :( 
Something inside me is not quite right\ 
I just can't seem to have one good night\ 
Alone , alone in my dark , dark room\ 
My heart feels locked inside my chest in a tomb\ 
It aches and it calls out for my love far away\ 
It wishes and prays someday she'll stay\ 
Her heart safe by mine together as one\ 
To forever in time together they run 
had a pretty decent day ... ended up losing my voice but for a while I could do movie trailers with perfect accuracy :P
