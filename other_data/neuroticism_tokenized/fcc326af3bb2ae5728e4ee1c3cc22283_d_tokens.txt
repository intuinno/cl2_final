I didn't know < PROPFEMALE>'s body still looked like that . 

Primary elections are tomorrow , New Yorkers . Please go out and vote . Primaries are important . Also , consider voting for new people . No matter what party , if your congressman has been in their seat for 100 years ( or if you only see their face around election season ) , a change might be nice . 
While watching the Daily 10 ... \ 
Father : What's that ? \ 
Me : Jersey Shore people . \ 
Father : Oh ... Snooki . Oh ! No that one's Snooki . What's that ? ShamWow ? \ 
Me : Close ! It's JWoww [ is you spell it ? ]\ 
\ 
That moment was hilarious and priceless . I didn't know my parents had knew any Jersey Shore people other than the incomparable Snooki .

I'm not into fake nails but I just discovered gel nails and I'm in awe . I want . 
I feel like my brain is disintegrating and will soon become millions of pieces of shiny confetti . 
Is anyone else watching the NY governor's debate ? What is going on ? The facial hair on The Rent Is Too Damn High guy is not even the strangest part of it . 
I'm not going to let myself be depressed about Republicans getting control of the House . I will focus on happier things like the fact that < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > (!) from Food Network is technically our NYS First Lady . < PROPFEMALE > Cox and I have agreed that she'll probably instate \Cocktail Time ! Wednesdays\ " and \ " Vanilla Vodka Thursdays \"." 
I should be going straight home from Staten Island on Fridays . I don't know what psychotic logic tells me I have the energy for doing anything other than that . 
Conan ! 
I don't think I like channel 11 news anymore . 
Day 4 of jury service . Deliberations start this afternoon . We've been getting along so far . Let's see what happens now that we have to make decisions . 
I just finished serving on a jury . My advice is that you should never do a favor for anyone that involves getting \something\ " from someone you barely know to give to a person you don't know at all without asking critical questions . " 
Not having my own classroom really is a giant disadvantage discipline-wise and missing last week really threw my routine off . I kind of want to ask to teach in the lunchroom or something so that I have my own space . 
I bought a $0.99 alarm clock from IKEA . I thought I knew how to set an alarm clock but now I think I was wrong . Help please ? 
ugh . I keep running into this man who drives an ambulette and wants my # . I was waiting for the 17 by my house and I had to lie and say that I live downtown . The bus actually came on time and saved me . 
Finally got new glasses . No more squnting for me . 
I don't think I've ever seen the streets look like this after snow . Only Remsen Ave looks plowed . Are all the sanitation workers on vacation ? I'm going to go make snow people when the wind gets less treacherous and < PROPFEMALE > Cox wakes up again . 
It looks like a bomb exploded in my room . I'm going to be responsible and clean up . 
I'm so mad there isn't a delay . 
My outfits are becoming more and more early 90's-ish . Today I looked like I could be an extra in Poison < PROPFEMALE > . At this rate , I might turn into < PROPFIRST > Love or something . 
good speech 
Direct deposit is failing me . I have loans to pay ... 
Why couldn't the Steelers play like this against the Jets ? 
I hate unhelpful bus drivers . 
Happy for Egypt ! That's what I was hoping to see when I turned on the TV . 
Oh Gaga ... I love you . She's in a womb . 
I love the hell out of Mick Jagger ... 
Some people are way too loud on the ferry . The sun just came up and they need to calm down . 
I'm late for work so this is the first time this ferry trip feels endless . Also , Happy Ash Wednesday . 
At work today , one Kindergartener asked me if I turned 50 (!!!) doubling my age exactly and carelessly . She was serious . \ 
Their assistant teacher told them I was 10 years old and none of them blinked at that statement . \ 
\ 
I'm pretty confident that I had a much better perception of age and time when I was 5/6 years old . 
I got my alumni card from Pratt . Now I don't have to pretend that my old ID is current when I go to museums . 
< PROPFEMALE > Cox is calling the house looking for birthday wishes ! Twenty one years of shamelessness from my little sister ... 
It's confusing when the Astro < PROPFIRST > isn't a dollar < PROPFIRST > but the Altima is a dollar cab . 
Why was that so hard Bloomberg ? Why didn't you just pick Walcott in the first place ? 
< PROPFIRST > Trump said \Saudi Arabia wouldn't even be there if it weren't for us . \ " I can't! Why do these men think that they can say any random thing and it will magically become an enlightening fact ? " 
Is everyone wathcing the news !!!!! 
I went to see the < PROPFIRST > McQueen exhibit at The Met yesterday and it was one of the greatest things I've ever experienced . I'm such a nerd that I almost cried . 
Mavs !!! 
It can't be that people can afford fancy touch screen phones and iWhatevers but not $15 earbuds . They're just asses who think that we'll be happy they chose to be the DJ for our bus ride right ? 
< PROPFEMALE > Cox , if you're currently feeling an inexplicable feeling of relief it's due to the fact that I'm currently using enough gold glitter to make Ke$ha jealous and you're intuitively glad to be 400+ < PROPMALE > away from it . \ 
Was that a run-on sentence ? 
< PROPFIRST > !!! 
My sister and I have taken care of 90% of our vacation plans . All planes and trains are booked but no hotels yet . 
< PROPFIRST > !!!!!! 
That game would have been over a long time ago if < PROPMALE > wasn't ill . 
Someone has to tell me why < PROPFIRST > Weiner has to resign . I clearly don't get it . As far as I can tell this is an issue between him and his family . 
One more game ! 
< PROPFEMALE > Cox I don't know if you're checking the score from the bus , but < PROPFIRST > is seconds away from winning !! 
I recently found out that one of my Kindergarteners live in a commune . For me , that explains why the drawing he made in my class on Friday was \ ... me and my dad looking at the evening sky . \ " He's said a lot of mystical stuff like that during the course of the school year . " 
This reporter on Pix11 news seems to believe that Yonkers is a part of the 5 boroughs ! I can't with them anymore . 
So I went to Harrods today and all I can say is that one knows that one is shopping out of one's league when surrounded by fancy Saudi and Emirati women and flamboyant Persian men . I can't keep up with people who own oil and/or countries ... 
I have to retire my purple sweater ... 
this has been a good game . 
My meeting did not turn into an inquisition and , for that , I am glad . I'm also glad that SI is not burning up like Brooklyn is . Too bad I'm leaving now . 
Yesterday , I was trying to convince my mother to go hiking with my father by telling her that thousands of people hike everyday without ever encountering a bear . Then we watched the news and found out that a group of hikers was attacked by bears in Alaska . \ 
My argument is now invalid and my mother probably won't be hiking in North < PROPFEMALE > anytime soon . 
My sister and I just went into a frenzy when the < PROPFEMALE > Explains it all theme started . 
I'm at < PROPMALE > Hodges and there are these guys a couple lanes away who are playing with an intense level of competition and mediocre skill . I can't even explain it . < PROPFEMALE > said they're doin ' the most ... 
I love that there are always a couple of people who think that every earthquake means that the end of times is near . Earthquakes are not new . I'm going to have to edit which stauses come up on this news feed . 
Every gas station I passed in Canarsie on the way home was packed . Ironically , when I was in Coney Island ( which is likely to be flooded ) everyone was super calm . 
That < PROPFIRST > , the Creator kid isn't bad . His crew's a bit hood and kids who aren't too bright probably shouldn't listen to music like that but he's making decent stuff . 
If I have more days that end with me on a hot school bus , shouting at kids to get quiet for a head count , and hustling to open those weird bus windows I will acquire a few more gray hairs but lose a few pounds ... 
I feel like I'm always explaining why Earth Science class is important .... Just know that , this morning , I had to let these girls on the ferry know that the large , bright , red thing rising into the sky over Brooklyn was neither the < PROPFEMALE > nor Saturn but the sun .
