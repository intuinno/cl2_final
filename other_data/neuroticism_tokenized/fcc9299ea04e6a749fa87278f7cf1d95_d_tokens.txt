Happy4th ofJuly everyone ... But when a long train of abuses&usurpations , pursuing invariably the\

this as your status if someone you knew was killed by Lord Voldemort or\ 
any of his followers . As everybody knows , being killed by a killing \ 
curse , having your soul sucked out by a dementor , or getting petrified \ 
by a basilisk is a truly tragic fate for anyone ; Muggle or Wizard . 93% \ 
... of people won't copy and paste this . Will you make this your status \ 
for at least one hour ? 
Remember , remember the 5th of November , the gun powder treason and plot . I know of no reason why the gun powder treason should ever be forgot .

Who are you ? \

Who ? Who is but the form following the function of what and what I am is a man in a mask . \ 
Well I can see that . \ 
Of course you can . I'm not questioning your powers of observation I'm \ 
merely remarking upon the paradox of asking a masked man who he is . \ 
Oh . Right .

The Boy you just called stupid ? He has a learning disability & studies over 4hrs a night . The Girl you just called fat ? She has been starving herself & has lost over 30lbs . The Boy you just tripped ? He is abused enough at home . The Girl you just called ugly ? She spends hours putting makeup on hoping people will like her . There's a lot more to people than you think . Put this as your status if you're against bullying
