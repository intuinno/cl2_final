Put this as your status if you know someone who suffers from being a Michigan fan . Being a Wolverine Fan is a real disorder and should be takin seriously . There is still no known cure for MF and sympathy does not help , but we can raise awareness . 100% of OSU fans will repost this .. simply because we know how to copy and paste as well as tie our shoes . BEAT MICHIGAN WEEK !! 
Haven't been on here in a couple of days , hopefully I will get my laptop back tomorrow ! 
A little late , but I hope everyone had a great Christmas ! I know I did ! :)

Cancer patients have only one wish ; to get better . I know that 97% of you won't post this as your status , but my friends will be the 3% that do . In honor of someone you know who has died or is fighting cancer , please post this for at least one hour 
I wish I didn't have to work today :( 
BOYFRIEND WEEK - If you have a boyfriend who is your best friend , who works hard for you , who's been with you through thick and thin , who loves you even when you're at your worst , and whom you are PROUD to be with , copy and paste this with the date you started your relationship ? 04-29-2009 ?

It's been said that everlasting friends can go long periods of time without speaking and never question the friendship . These types of friends pick up like they just spoke yesterday , regardless of how long it has been or how far away they live , and they don't hold grudges . They understand that life is busy .. but you will ALWAYS love them . Re-post if you have at least 1 of these friends , they will know who they are 
I would like my Facebook friends & family to comment on this status , sharing HOW YOU MET ME . But I want you to lie . That's right , just make it up . After you comment , copy this to your status , so I can do the same . I bet half won't read the instructions right . 
No one will get this right ! my age___ , my favorite soda_______ , my full birthday___/___/___ ,, my best friend_____ , my favorite color______ , my eye color_______ , my hair color______ my favorite food________and my moms name__________ !!! Put this as your status and see who knows you best 
I officially have a new job ! 
Thank you for all the birthday wishes everyone ! :) I had a great birthday , complete with chicken wings and a movie with Brenden , and shopping tomorrow with mom ! Love you guys ! 
Had a blast with mom today ! :) Kind of sucks that we had to rush , but it was still fun . Love you mom ! 
I have a personal reason for asking if everyone could please put this as their status for 1 hour . I know the ones that will !! Think of the ones you know or love who have or had cancer . My wish is that in 2011 a cure will be found . Will you post it for 1 hour ? Do it for all . There are too many to mention who have fought and who are fighting - I hope to see this in the status of my friends . 
To anyone who was ' tagged ' in one of the ' fun with your name ' photos , I have absolutely no idea why you were tagged
