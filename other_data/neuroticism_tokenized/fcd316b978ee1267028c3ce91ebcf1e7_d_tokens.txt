Beat < PROPFEMALE > Khemia ! Only took slightly more than 20 hours , so fairly short by RPG standards . Now I need to buy the second game . I'll probably start Final Fantasy < PROPFEMALE > next . 

Mall :) 
I have a lovely bunch of coconuts . But you can't have any . 
Tired after a long day . New Wave helps , though :) 
Stupid Wii . I definitely have no idea how to set you up . 
Oh , AVGN . How you make me lawl . 
Know what's neat ? Putting Cocoa Puffs and Peanut Butter Crunch in the same bowl and pretending that you're eating Reese's Puffs . ' Cause it tastes the same . Kinda . 
Playing Super Metroid ! 
I should probably go to bed soon . Or like , right now . 
I hate Megavideo . So much . 
I'm doing what I told myself I would never again do . I'm playing through the Silent Hill games . 
Noodles ftw , mang . 
I seem to have lost my pencil ...

Oh manz , trolling random people FTW . 
So , trick-or-treat was fun . Lots ' o < PROPFEMALE > FTW :D 
Oh < PROPMALE > tharr . 
I hate the Wii and how complicated it is . Just let me play my stupid game . 
Of course the Cowboy Bebop finale would be on television as I'm watching the Dragonball GT finale . This means I have to stop one to watch the other . Argh ! 
Sailor < PROPFEMALE > FTW . Just sayin ' . Super saiyan , even . 
Total Drama World Tour finale !! I iz totes excitedness . 
Hey , guess who very stupidly decided to stay up all night ? Probably not the best move . 
' Bout to watch The Evil Dead trilogy . 
And once again I've stayed up far later than intended . Niiice . 
Mall today :) And then < PROPMALE > POTTER later tonight !!!! 1 
New < PROPMALE > Potter . Nothing too ohmazing , but still p . good . Eager to see part 2 . 
Everybody should go play Braaains on here . Or at least go through the tutorial in the beginning , so you can be added as my ally . I need moar ! 
Season finale of The Venture Bros .! 
Snivy , Tepig , and Oshawott . English names of the Pokemon Black/White starters . \

Pokemon picture go ! Now everybody else do it . 
Finally beat Tales of the Abyss ! Yay ! It only took 43:37 . I think I'll go back to Okami now . I sorta abandoned it shortly after starting :) 
Ugh . Sunday . 
Walked about 78695504 < PROPMALE > in the freezing cold death to watch The Nightmare Before Christmas with < PROPFIRST > Parsons , < PROPMALE > Wentz , and < PROPMALE > Eardley ! 
Beat Okami ! Took 48:53 , so a bit longer than TotA . I think I'll start Final Fantasy II next . 
So , my Final Fantasy II doesn't work D: \ 
I guess this means I'll just have to move on to Final Fantasy < PROPFEMALE > . 
The picture on my TV is dying :/\ 
I'll probably have to get a new one soon . Who wants to give me one for free ? \ 
And if you don't want to just give it away , well wynaut ? \ 
Don't you like me enough to give me free stuffs ?

Cookies , pizza , Sailor < PROPFEMALE > , and a good RPG . There's my Christmas < PROPFEMALE > :) \ 
And probably my Christmas day as well . 
Oh , just got a totally sweet Sailor < PROPFEMALE > theme for my PSP . 
My copy of < PROPFEMALE > Megami Tensei : Nocturne arrived today ! :D 
So my iPod is completely dead D: \ 
I'm hoping I can take it somewhere and get it fixed or something . Otherwise that's almost 10,000 songs I'll never get back , as it took about four years to get there in the first place . 
I hate snow :/ 
Fusions on SMT : N . Such a huge pain . Argh , why is it so complicated ? 
1/11/11 11:11:11 . That happened today . Neat . 
< PROPFEMALE > Megami Tensei : Nocturne is officially beaten . True Demon ending , 100% Demonic Compendium , all Magatamas acquired . Alriiight . Took 38:04 . Granted , a lot of that time was spent fusing and traversing the Labyrinth of Amala . The main game actually felt pretty short . I'm not sure what to play next . Definitely going to be getting some more SMT games though . 
So my computer is only a couple months old and already it's breaking ... 
My copy of < PROPFEMALE > Megami Tensei : Persona 3 FES just arrived ! I know what game I'm immediately starting :D 
I REALLY hate entering CB codes manually ... 
Got my copy of GrimGrimoire and Heavenly Guardian today ! :) But , argh , why are games so expensive ? 
So , Duke Nukem Forever . That's actually happening now . Neato . 
Mall today . Should be fun :) 
So tired after today . But it was fun :) Saw The Green Hornet . 
Just found out that the new Pokemon movie premieres on a Saturday :( 
I feel like it's too early for me to be awake . 
I'm feelin ' some pizza and some Persona 3 . Sounds like a good way to spend the night . 
So the server on my computer crashed last night , effectively blocking me from the internet completely . I turn it on today and it's magically fixed . Fie on technology ! 
I finally finished watching Sailor < PROPFEMALE > :D All 200 episodes . On to Beyblade ! 
ZOMG , new Endless Dismal Moan !! 1one 
Ohayocon tomorrow ! I iz excitedness . 
Just got home from < PROPMALE > . Ohayocon was amazing awesome and just made of win . I didn't take nearly as many pictures as I would have liked , so little that I might not even upload them . I'll definitely take more next year . I'm going back to bed now . So sore from the rave last night :P 
New season of Sym-Bionic Titan ! :D 
Man , this is a good week for TV . Season premiere of Sym-Bionic Titan was on Wednesday and today we have a new episode of Young Justice plus the season premieres of < PROPMALE > 10 and Generator < PROPMALE > :D 
So fun/interesting/WTF day . Made $150 , which is neat , and < PROPMALE > with some peeps , but also ended up getting right above my eye split open . There was a lot of blood . Pics are up , but the quality sucks , so you can't really see it too well . Oh well ! :D 
New Pokemon movie ! On right now ! :D 
So many statuses about the Super Bowl ... Especially now that it's over . 
Another all-nighter ? Jeez . This has gotta stop . Nighty night ! :) 
SMT : Persona 3 FES is beaten ! Well , The Journey , anyway , which is the main game . I still have to beat The Answer , which is a continuation . 57:50 was total time . Pretty long game . 100% Persona Compendium , all Social Links maxed in a single playthrough , and all < PROPFEMALE>'s Requests completed , except for #55 , which you can only do on the second playthrough . I'm hoping The Answer will be just as amazing as The Journey . 
My pencil ran out of lead D: 
Just ordered $50 headphones . They better not suck or I'm gonna be like FUUUUUUUUU 
Alright , I beat The Answer on Persona 3 . So now < PROPFEMALE > Megami Tensei : Persona 3 FES is completely beaten . It only took a little over 7 hours , so pretty short . I can't wait to get more SMT games . It's becoming one of my favourite seiries . 
Agh , I be sick . And thus cannot sleep :( 
My headphones arrived today ! And they're p . boss . Also , my copy of < PROPFEMALE > Megami Tensei : Persona 4 also arrived !!! 1one\ 
I know what game I'm playing next . 
New phone is new , yes ? 937-825-3020 
Mall today . Let's hope lack of sleep and being sick doesn't ruin the day too much . :) 
Today was fun :) I didn't get what I wanted in the mail though ... 
I need a Wii . Who wants to donate ? Or at least become my ho and I'll pimp you out to earn the money to buy one . 
Cocoa Puffs mixed with Raisin Bran . Hmm ... 
So I have these stereo instructions . And there's a grammar mistake . Not a typo , but an actual incorrect usage of a word . * < PROPMALE > headdesk . * 
I wonder what Pokemon are like inside the Pokeballs . Are they like , incorporeal balls of red , or what ? I'mma make it my life's mission to find this out . 
It's Sunday again . Blargh . 
My coccyx hurts . 
I'm ' bout to kill this iPod so hard . 
My feet . They be sore . 
I saw someone in jeggings today at the mall . I raged . Btw , I totally picked up Pokemon White Version while there . Yeah boiiii . 
Guns don't kill people . Uh-uh . I kill people . With guns . 
My television appears to have frozen . Huh . 
SMT : Persona 4 is beaten ! 58:48 . Slightly longer than P3 . True ending , 100% Persona Compendium and all Requests fulfilled . I never thought I'd say this , but enjoyed it more than P3 . Which is a huge deal . I think I'm going to take a short break from the MegaTen series and play through Banjo-Kazooie next . :P 
Tired . All-nighters aren't fun . 
Spoon . 
I hear going to bed at 5:00 AM is cool . 
About to start < PROPFEMALE > Megami Tensei : Digital Devil Saga . 
))))))))))))))) 
So I'm listening to the radio . And a song comes on . Shocker , I know . Well , anyway , it sounded familiar . It wasn't what I thought it was , but the song directly afterward was what I thought the first one was . Weirrdd . 
Best Buy is so useful :) 
Apparently Action Replay exists for the PSP . Gotta get me one these . 
So after constantly complaining about not having an iPod , I remembered that my PSP can play music . I still want an iPod , though . 
I hate being up this late . There's never anything to do . 
Just beat SMT : Digital Devil Saga . Now to beat it again ! :D 
Pizza and videogames . Sounds good :) 
Mall today with Sucker Punch later :D 
Sucker Punch was really amazing . The best movie I've seen since Let Me In and Black Swan . 
Sunday . AGAIN . Someone needs to do something about this day . 
I never knew there was an extra scene after credits in Pirates of Caribbean : Curse of the Black < PROPFEMALE > . Huh . 
I just looked down at my hand , and there was blood on it . No cut , just blood . 
Man ... 
Staying up all night never seems like a good idea at the time , but in the morning it's still definitely not a good idea . 
Mall . Sounds good , no ? \ 
Yeah , you're right , probably not . 
So that whole \I haven't eaten anything all day\ " thing . It ain't feeling too great right now . " 
Runzelstirn & Gurgelstøck . 
Why is no one ever online at this hour ?
