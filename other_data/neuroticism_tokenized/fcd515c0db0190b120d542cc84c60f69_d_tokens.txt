doesn't know what to do or think anymore .... Argh . 
School in a couple of hours . Blah .

\We are not what we shall be but we are growing toward it . The process is not yet finished but it is going on . This is not the end but it is the road . \""

I am not seeing anyone , nor am I interested in anyone . I am allowed friends of the opposite sex . Jeez . Got it , people ? -_- 
wants to go back in the past where she was happy and in love not heartbroken and living day by day . Love and relationships , in my opinion , can go to hell . :)

Rain and thunder is not my cup of tea . :/ 
has been making very healthy food for the past days . Getting really good at cooking ! :D 
had a fun weekend . :) 
Complicated . 
Sometimes , I don't understand the way life works . 
My life has turned into a direction that I thought I would never even glance at . I think it has made me more sad and more of an adult than I had ever wanted , considering the reason behind it . :/ 
sometimes wishes she could become a child again . Everything was so much easier . 
Time to make cupcakes for tomorrow ? I think yes ! <3 
had a really nice day . Thanks guys . :D 
It will never cease to amaze me how the beginning of fall in Texas feels like spring in Germany . <3 
can't wait till Germany !!! :) 
needs this semester to end already . :P 
For the first time since I've dyed my hair , I want it to be natural . 
<3 
is going insane . 
There were two death threats at my college last week on Thursday . The school called the police but didn't feel the need to inform the students that there was a < PROPMALE > we could all die in a given moment . -_- 
There are two choices in life : settle or take risks . I have decided to take risks . Hmm . Wonder what will happen ? 
Buzz fest was awesomeeeee . Had a lot of fun ! :) 
spends way too much time at school . -_- 
Be careful what you wish for . When it happens , you might not like it . :/ 
Hmmmm . 
While in the shower : I flipped my hair behind my shoulder and somehow it wrapped itself around the hose of my shower head . -_- I don't know whether to be happy my hair is that long or be annoyed . 
Today , I am the happiest person on earth . I feel so light and happy . :D 
Last night was fun but I need to work on my pool skills . 
got the flu shot yesterday . It still hurts . :(

Love <3

\How I wish you could see the potential/The potential of you and me \"" 
Happy Thanksgiving everyone ! 
A cold front . Bye , bye to 80 degrees ... boo . :/

\We cannot change anything unless we accept it . \ " < PROPFIRST > < PROPFEMALE > " 
Applying for jobs . Let's see how that goes .

Freaking dinosaurs . -_- 
Who wants to go shopping tomorrow ? 
Woohoo ! Almost 80 degrees F . Awesomeeeeee ! 
Just made some awesome spaghetti and garlic bread , if I do say so myself . 
<3<3<3 
It's finally getting really cold down here in Texas . :( Boo . 
Scientists should figure out a way to use salt water to fuel cars instead of gas . We have plenty of that therefore they shouldn't be allowed to charge these ridiculous rates . Honestly ! 
The Nutcracker Ballet was amazing ! They were all so beautiful ! 
27 Degrees F in Texas . WTH . :/ 
Studying for exams and getting to leave for Germany . Argh . Oh well , ready to go and see the family ! Totally not ready for the snow though . :/ 
Finished my Gov't final . Argh . I hope I did good . So just need to pack , clean , and study for < PROPMALE > history final . Blah . 
I have been running on naps . o.O Crazy . 
Finally , I am done with this semester ! Now it's time to relax in Germany with my family and bestie . :) 
About to fly to Germany ! Excited to see the family ! 
I am back in Germany ! Woot ! 
Going to a Christmas party tonight with the family ! Should be fun ... right ? 
So , I won < PROPFEMALE>'s Secret lotion , So Sexy shampoo and conditioner , a cell phone , a GPS , and a thermo . Woot , woot . The Christmas party was fun after all ! 
If I get stuck in the house this whole entire time I'm here , I will go insane . Stop snowing Germany ! NOW . 
Making cookies today while finishing decorating the tree and wrapping gifts ! :) 
The Christmas Market in K-town is terrible ! Argh . 
LittleBigPlanet . :) 
Mmm . Made some delicious oatmeal cookies ! Chocolate chip ones tomorrow ! :) 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas ! :) 
Saw my goddaughter ! She's getting so big ! :) 
Finally get to get out of my house ! I thought I was going to go insane . Heading to the mall and hooters with bestie ! :) 
New Years in Amsterdam with the bestie and brother ! Should be fun . 
Crazy night . :/ 
New Years in Amsterdam ! So excited . 
made hot and spicy tofu for the family ! Even the carnivore aka my dad liked it . :) 
Some people weave burlap into the fabric of our lives , and some weave gold thread . Both contribute to make the whole picture beautiful and unique . 
Nothing beats a mug of hot cocoa on a cold day . Almost makes me miss the days when it was snowing constantly . Almost . 
It's snowing ! D:< 
Possibly more flooding in my area . So long as it doesn't flood the roads we should be good . :/ 
Can't wait till Your Highness is out in theaters ! 
So , my car has an oil leak . :( 
Pop rocks ! 
It was nice to eat breakfast with my mom . Definitely will miss it . :/ 
Last day in Germany . :( 
Flexitarian ; a person who eats a predominantly vegetarian diet , but who eats meat or fish occasionally . What are YOU ? 
Back in the states . 
Burnt my hand . :/ 
School tomorrow . :/ 
New year , new start . 
This semester has a negative outlook . However , I am going to beast it . Simple as that . 
Movies with < PROPFEMALE > Nguyen later today ! 
Terrible , terrible nightmare . Hope it never comes true . 
Had a productive day . Worked out and went job hunting . 
When it comes to what I want in a relationship , platonic or romantic , I think too much like a guy . What I want is what I want . No drama and no stress . 
Studying . :/ Need to buckle down early in studying for this semester to be a complete success . Study group later ! :) 
Studying group with < PROPFEMALE > Nguyen was fun ! 
Bettering myself and this semester ? Check . Now , I just need to keep it up ! Still a few decisions to make but everything so far is going good . 
Got my daily dose of endorphins . Good workout ! Now time to study for the biology test ... which I have every week . 
Damn good workout ! Tomorrow will be the third day of being sore , I can tell already . 
Going to < PROPMALE > ! <3 
Argh ! 
Party . <3 
Had a good new year ! Two New Years in one . Awesomeeeee . 
I deserve way better . </3 
I wish people would just grow up and be honest and direct . It would save a lot of time and a lot of pain . Maturity and respect , is that so hard to ask for ? 
My stomach as been hurting all week ! Argh . On top of it , Texans crack me up on how they are treating this cold weather . No snow , no ice , no sleet , and everyone stays at home instead of going to class . Funny ! 
Texans sure are afraid of cold weather . Just drove home in ice rain , and the cos ways are COVERED in salt . Not a bad thing since I have no snow tires , but jeez ... that would come handy in Germany , not so much here . 
Wow . Yeah . Whatever . 
Got a Ford Escape SUV as my rental ! It's amazing . I love it . Also , 19 kills on COD : Black Ops ! Hell yeah ! 
Really intense and hard work out . I found an excellent motivator . SCREW YOU . :) 
You know , sometimes you have to post the whole song and not just a line or two ... 
Who wants to go running tomorrow ?! 
I hate biology . I can't even find any of the answers in the book OR notes . WTF . 
Going to < PROPMALE > ! <3 :) 
Finally got a job . :) Start training on Wednesday ! 
Who wants to drive around tomorrow ? 
Waiting doesn't seem too hard ... maybe . 
Let's go running ! 
I just want to punch you in the face , < PROPFEMALE > bad . 
Only two days of training and I did not mess up on my first try at waiting tables . Hell yeah . 
Cleaning , laundry , and studying . Yay . 
Despite how early I woke up , today has been a productive day . Went to school , running , and work . :) Now , I just need to wind down to go to sleep ! Menu test tomorrow at work :/ 
We did blood typing in our lab today . I'm an A . Cool stuff . Took forever to even a droplet of blood though . 
Despite everything that has happened , I am actually happy . Even though , I have nothing going for me right now . Odd ... but I'm enjoying the happiness while it lasts . :) It must be those hard work outs ! Endorphins ... gotta love them . 
My arms are killing me D: 
I love my job . Honestly , I do . So ... come one , come all to Gumbo Bar in League City ! 
Going to UHCL open house 
Full-time student and full-time waitress . Hmm . I see many busy days ahead . 
I love my coworkers ! They're all so much fun . :) 
Who wants to go clubbing tomorrow night ?! I need to dance , be with some friends , and release some stress by having a fun work out aka dancing . Haha .
