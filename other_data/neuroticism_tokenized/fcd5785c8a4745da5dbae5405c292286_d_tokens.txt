Love ya Dad , Father's Day is approaching . Yellow roses grow in Heaven , Lord pick a bunch for me . Place them in my Father's arms & tell him they're from me . Tell him that I love and miss him . When he turns to smile place a kiss upon his cheek and hold him for awhile , because remembering him is easy , I do it everyday . There's an ache in my heart that will never go away . If your Dad is in Heaven copy & post . 
Why does bad things happen to good people ?!
