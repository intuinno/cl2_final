It's kinda weird watching a show about doctors when you are wearing the same exact scrubs at the moment . O___O 

When a scantily clad woman asks you to dance , you do not refuse . :D 
Homecoming was really fun . But , I am dead tired . 
God . Today was THE most stressful day of my life . Dx 
Dude , I have been hearing sirens all night . D: 
Bleh . Was the longest , most unpreductive day of my life . 
HAPPY CHRISTMAS !! 
Just got peed upon by < PROPFEMALE > . Then , THEN , spit up spewed all over me . Right after I changed from the pee spillage . I LOVE MY NIECE ! <3 
Just saw Sherlock Holmes . Was really funny . Though it was rather long . D: 
D: My hands have smurf-like qualities . No , seriously , my hands are dyed so purple , I look like I washed myself in Smurf secretions . 
Just got back from the movies with Steph . Sorry < PROPFIRST > that I didn't invite you again . But hey . :D We < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > on the way home . Badly . It was all great fun . <3 
After bleaching my hands in a < PROPFIRST > Jackson-like manner a few times , they look less like Smurf hands and more like I fingered some grapes . Pleasant . xD 
You know what is hot ? The beach . We could only be there for like an hour before we became scrambled eggs . OH ! There actually was a guy who was cooking on his car dashboard BECAUSE it was so hot . xD 
Yay ! HAPPY 1ST BIRTHDAY < PROPFEMALE > ! <3 
Somebody answered a question about me that I don't like British accents . \

Making some oatmeal cookies . <3 Mmmmm 
D: What is going on with my sinuses ? I just had my 5th nose bleed in a week . It can't be good . 
Had a nice day so far with < PROPFEMALE > . We went and got Chinese food and to < PROPFEMALE>'s . So when she gets back from therapy , gonna color her hair ; < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > style . This should be fun . :D 
Oh man . < PROPFIRST > and I pulled the best prank on < PROPFEMALE > today . We set it up so < PROPFEMALE > didn't know < PROPFIRST > was over my house , so about 10 minutes after we get there , < PROPFIRST > makes it seem like she was breaking in . Boy , she thought she was going to die . It was great . xD 
I am SO lame . I just changed most of my phone's contacts to < PROPMALE > Potter characters . The ones that I can't get characters to fit too or I won't remember who they ACTUALLY are , I am just pretending they are Muggles with boring names . xD 
Man . Long day at the zoo . But , I got to see all the pretty animals . Though they were seriously lacking in the unicorn department . : l Now , I want to sleep . 
I bought some really cute unicorn earrings today . Now , my ears are magical . :D 
I am in tears . xDD 
Man , I was Ms. Clumsy today . First , I slipped and fell on our newly shined floors . My knee is all messed up . Then later , I was jogging down my yard to the jeep , and instead of stopping , I decided I would let the car do it for me . And just now , I barely touched a drying glass , and it fell off the counter , shattering EVERYWHERE . I should just go to bed ; give the world a favor . /sigh 
Just came back from seeing Inception with < PROPFEMALE > . Man , that was a good movie . I really want to see it again . :D 
This is the first free moment I have had in a couple days . I now get to relax ; well , as much relaxing as I can get whilst doing online school work . BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER , BECAUSE I WENT TO < PROPMALE > POTTER IN UNIVERSAL AND IT WAS THE BEST THING IN EXISTENCE EVERRRRRRRRRR . 
I like fezzes . Fezzes are cool . :3 
I'm so lame . I looked up my last name on here . There are 500 of us . And including me , 5 Samanthas . Hm . 
OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMG . I JUST FOUND THE ENTIRE OVERVIEW OF THE FIRST PART OF THE DEATHLY HALLOWS FILM . DO I READ IT ? I DUNNO . I'M SOOO CONFLICTED . And I know it's legit from where I found it . But , I literally just sat here for 5 minutes , with my hands covering my eyes going \No . No . NO . DON'T READ IT . Don't do it . \ " ... But I think I will . DDDDD: " 
Homework Homework Homework . Never ending homework . D: 
It's September 1st ! For day of school at Hogwarts ! :DD

Listening to the Deathly Hallows soundtrack . AND IT IS MARVELOUS . 
Eating some miso . It's the Oriental < PROPMALE > in the land of soup .

Laptop , why must you be this way ? 
That awkward moment when you are blaring The Sex Has Made Me Stupid in your car and an elderly couple pulls up next to you at a red light and stares . 
I may or may not be watching the Spongebob Movie that I forgot I had on DVD . 
No . I am not texting Music Choice < PROPMALE > Potter quotes .
