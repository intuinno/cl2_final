really wishes that she had tickets to the KROQ concert tonight so she could see AFI Three Days Grace and Rise Against live ... but she doesn't so she'll just have to watch it online :'( 

I just realized that the superbowl is on my birthday this year :( And my dad just told me that I have to get my braces put on a few days before it ... Not fair :'( 
Just got back from ice skating with my dad . Soooo much fun :) It was my first time and I didn't fall ... I'm proud of myself lol 
Best night of my life . :) 
Lone Pine is an interesting little town ... So far I've watched someone get hit by a car , jumped into a freezing pool , and watched a little girl pick her nose then stick her fingers in my dad's drink ... What's next ? 
Grrr I can hear the people in the hotel room next to me laughing and yelling and there are people running up and down the stairs outside . Every little noise in this creepy place freaks me out ... I'll never get to sleep :( 
I'm so stressed about this English project :( 
Baking cookies for the bake sale tomorrow :) 
is ready for a new semester and a fresh start ... 
Getting up at 3 wasn't as bad as I thought it would be ... and it was totally worth it :) 
is excited about turning 16 tomorrow :D
