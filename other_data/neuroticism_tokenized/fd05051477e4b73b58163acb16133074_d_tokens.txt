Please put this in your status if you know or LOVE someone who is gay . My wish for 2010 and beyond is that people will understand that being gay is neither a disease nor a choice . People who are gay are not looking for a cure but ACCEPTANCE and EQUAL RIGHTS . ? Promote LOVE and Acceptance , NOT Hate .
