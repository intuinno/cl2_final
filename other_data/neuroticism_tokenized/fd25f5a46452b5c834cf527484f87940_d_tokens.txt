Chilling at home , looking to the future and wondering what awaits me when I get there . 

Sometimes , it can be hard to define who you are . Trying to hard can alter your results , trying to little may not reveal the truth . Everything in moderation I suppose . 
All that is gold does not glitter , Not all those who wander are lost ; The old that is strong does not wither , Deep roots are not reached by the frost . From the ashes a fire shall be woken , A light from the shadows shall spring ; Renewed shall be blade that was broken , The crownless again shall be < PROPMALE > . - JRR Tolkein , Lord of the Rings 
The Road goes ever on and on . Down from the door where it began . Now far ahead the Road has gone . And I must follow , if I can . Pursuing it with eager feet . Until it joins some larger way . Where many paths and errands meet . And whither then ? I cannot say . -JRR Tolkein , Lord of the Rings . 
Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky , Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone , Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die , One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie . One Ring to rule them all , One Ring to find them , One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie . -JRR Tolkein , Lord of the Rings 
You would think I would learn but all I ever do is seem to make a fool out of myself . * sigh * Hopefully people will cut me slack , even if I never learn . 
Bored ... If you want to < PROPFEMALE > out any time between 7 and 12 today let me know .

Well , I think it might be time for the real deal . Work tomorrow 930am -530pm . Text me or what not . GOOD NIGHT ! 
If you knew what I really thought , you wouldn't be smiling . 
Sometimes I wish I could be more open with people , but then again , no one would understand . 
Have a wonderful Earth Day everyone . Remember , this planet is the only one we got , so take care of it ! 
In this world few now exist who stand agains the dark . We all have fallen , but now is the time to rise . May the light of all good surround you . Expel the shadow that holds you and look anew to the future . Let not your fears hold you from hope and aid . Trust in your friends , trust in the light of this world , and trust that you can be saved .

PART 1 : I believe in cultivating opposite , but complementary views of life , and I believe in meeting life's challenges with contradictory strategies . I believe in reckoning with the ultimate meaninglessness of our existence , even as we fall in love with the miracle of being alive . - < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > 
Part 2 : I believe in working passionately to make our lives count while never losing sight of our insignificance . I believe in caring deeply and being beyond caring . It is by encompassing these opposites , by being involved and vulnerable , but simultaneously transcendent and detached , that our lives are graced by resilience and joy . - < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > 
I feel like I am spinning and scattering a hundred different ways , and simply I don't know what to do . So many different things rushing in and out of my mind , for once why can't things be simple . 
Got to < PROPFEMALE > out at Knockers pool hall ( no it is not a strip bar ) . Playing pool , and chatting it up helped me get a boost . 
Taking Steph to get a new phone at Verizon . After , possibly hanging out with < PROPFEMALE > and a couple of her friends . Txt me .

Keep love in your heart . A life without it is like a sunless garden when the flowers are dead . The consciousness of loving and being loved brings a warmth and richness to life that nothing else can bring . - < PROPFIRST > Wilde 
This December ! Family Guy : It's A Trap will be released . And < PROPFEMALE > will be portraying the Sarlaac ! 
One of the hardest things in life is having words in your heart that you can't utter . - < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > Jones

\So many thoughts to share\ 
And they say that a hero can save us . \ 
Im not gonna stand here and wait . \ 
I'll hold onto the wings of the eagles . \ 
Watch as we all fly away . \ 
Someone told me love will ALL save us . \ 
But how can that be , look what love gave us . \ 
A world full of killing , and blood-spilling\ 
That world never came . \ 
Now that the world isnt ending , its love that Im sending to you . \ 
It isnt the love of a hero , and thats why I fear it wont do . 
A shitty end to a shitty day ! 
text it ! 
I get such a thrill When u look in my eyes\ 
My heart skips a beat , girl I feel so alive\ 
Please tell me baby If all this is true\ 
Cause deep down inside All I wanted was u\ 
O Makes me wanna dance\ 
O Its a new romance\ 
O I look into your eyes\ 
O Best years of our lives

She wraps those hands around that pole \ 
She licks those lips and off we go \ 
She takes it off nice and slow \ 
' Cause that's porn < PROPFEMALE > dancing \ 
She don't play nice , she makes me beg \ 
She drops that dress around her legs \ 
And I'm sittin ' right by the stage \ 
For this porn < PROPFEMALE > dancing \ 
Your body's lightin ' up the room \ 
And I want a naughty girl like you \ 
There's nothing harder 
Dead I am the one , Exterminating son\ 
Slipping through the trees , strangling the breeze\ 
Dead I am the sky , watching angels cry\ 
While they slowly turn , conquering the worm\ 
Dig through the ditches , \ 
And burn through the witches\ 
I slam in the back of my\ 
Dragula 
I'm the fly in your soup\ 
I'm the pebble in your shoe\ 
I'm the pea beneath your bed\ 
I'm a bump on every head\ 
I'm the peel on which you slip\ 
I'm a pin in every hip\ 
I'm the thorn in your side\ 
Makes you wriggle and writhe\ 
And it's so easy when you're evil\ 
This is the life , you see\ 
The Devil tips his hat to me\ 
I do it all because I'm evil\ 
And I do it all for free\ 
Your tears are all the pay I'll ever need 
Swingin ' to the drums , swingin ' to guitar\ 
Swingin ' to the bass in the back of my car\ 
Ain't got money , ain't got no gas\ 
But we'll get where we're goin ' if we swing real fast\ 
I scream , you scream we all scream for her\ 
Don't even try ' cause you can't ignore her\ 
She's my < PROPFEMALE > pie\ 
Cool drink of water such a sweet surprise\ 
Tastes so good make a grown man cry\ 
Sweet < PROPFEMALE > pie , oh yeah 
She was gonna be an actress\ 
She was gonna be a star\ 
She was gonna shake her ass\ 
On the hood of Whitesnake’s car\ 
Her yellow SUV is now the enemy\ 
Looks at her average life\ 
And nothing has been alright since\ 
< PROPMALE > Springsteen , Madonna\ 
Way before Nirvana\ 
There was U2 and Blondie\ 
And music still on MTV\ 
Her two kids in high school\ 
They tell her that she’s uncool\ 
Cause she's still preoccupied\ 
With 19 , 19 , 1985 
Can you take me higher ? \ 
To the place where blind men see \ 
To the place with < PROPFEMALE > streets \ 
Although I would like our world to change \ 
It helps me to appreciate \ 
Those nights and those dreams \ 
But , my friend , I'd sacrifice all those nights \ 
If I could make the Earth and my dreams the same \ 
The only difference is \ 
To let love replace all our hate \ 
So let's go there \ 
Let's make our escape 
I’m just out to find\ 
The better part of me\ 
I’m more than a bird . I’m more than a plane\ 
More than a pretty face beside a train\ 
It’s not easy to be me\ 
Wish that I could cry\ 
Fall upon my knees Find a way to lie\ 
About a home I’ll never see\ 
It may sound absurd . But don’t be naive\ 
Even heroes have the right to bleed\ 
I may be disturbed . But won’t you concede\ 
Even heroes have the right to dream 
Bored so here goes : I will answer ONE and ONLY ONE question truthfully per person . Send your questions to my inbox otherwise I wont answer them . I will get to them as time allows .

I'm leavin ' my fam'ly\ 
Leavin ' all my friends\ 
My body's at home\ 
But my heart's in the wind\ 
Where the clouds are like headlines\ 
On a new front < PROPFEMALE > sky\ 
My tears are salt water\ 
And the < PROPFEMALE>'s full and high\ 
And I know < PROPFIRST > Eden's\ 
Gonna be proud of me\ 
And many before me\ 
Who've been called by the sea\ 
To be up in the crow's nest\ 
Singin ' my say\ 
Shiver me Timbers\ 
' Cause I'm a-sailin ' away 
You say you've turned it off , \ 
Hid your heart up on a shelf , \ 
Scared of what it might cost , \ 
To take it down for someone else , \ 
' Cause lovin him you lost , \ 
Too much of yourself , \ 
Baby can't you see that he's not me , \ 
And I need you to know you can fall into me , \ 
That my arms are wide open , \ 
And will always be , \ 
Right here waiting , staying strong , \ 
Come and fall into me , 
I need another story\ 
Something to get off my chest\ 
My life gets kinda boring\ 
Need something that I can confess\ 
Til ' all my sleeves are stained red\ 
From all the truth that I've said\ 
Come by it honestly I swear\ 
Thought you saw wink , no\ 
I've been on the brink , so\ 
Tell me what you want to hear\ 
Something that were like those years\ 
Sick of all the insincere\ 
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away 
I'm walking down the line\ 
That divides me somewhere in my mind\ 
On the border line\ 
Of the edge and where I walk alone\ 
Read between the lines\ 
What's fucked up and everything's alright\ 
Check my vital signs\ 
To know I'm still alive and I walk alone\ 
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me\ 
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating\ 
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me\ 
' Til then I walk alone 
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity . \ 
I'm not inclined to resign to maturity . \ 
If it's alright , then you're all wrong . \ 
But why bounce around to the same damn song ? \ 
You'd rather run when you can't crawl .. \ 
I know , you know , that I'm not telling the truth . \ 
I know , you know , they just don't have any proof . \ 
Embrace the deception- learn how to bend , \ 
Your worst inhibition's gonna psych you out in the end . 
Do you ever feel like breaking down ? \ 
Do you ever feel out of place ? \ 
Like somehow you just don't belong\ 
And no one understands you\ 
Do you ever wanna run away ? \ 
Do you lock yourself in your room ? \ 
With the radio on , turned up so loud\ 
That no one hears you screaming\ 
No you don't know what it's like\ 
When nothing feels alright\ 
You don't know what it's like , to be like me 
Samhain and All Hallow's < PROPFEMALE > is right around the bend . Be you Pagan , Christian , Atheist , or somewhere in between ; get ready for a night of excitement , terror , spirituatlity , and celebration . 
9 Hours until All Hallow's Evening , and 27 Hours until Samhain . I can't wait !!!! 
There is a change in the air , there is a change on the wind . And I know , I won't ever be the same again . 
Some men have only one book in them , others a library . \ 
-English Proverb 
Everytime I look ahead and see the sun is shining , my vision gets blocked by a great eclipse . 
Since the Revolution , till today we must remember those who have fought for freedom and safety . Remember the soldiers who have given everything for you and your way of life .
