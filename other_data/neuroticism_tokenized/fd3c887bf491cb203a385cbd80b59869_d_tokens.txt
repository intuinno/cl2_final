If we crawl Till we can walk again Then we'll run Until we're strong enough to jump Then we'll fly Until there is no end So lets crawl , crawl , crawl Back to love Back to love 
Relationships are too hard to start and end :( One of the reasons is because no1 asks you out until you tell them you like them -_- 
OMG I'm a fan of < PROPFEMALE > many things .. holy crap .. but I thought I was the only one any of this stuff happened to but people actually make fan things so i keep clicking become a fan ^_^

O FRICK HURT MY ARM IN GYM I TRIPPED AND MY ARM WAS LIKE THIS | ( STRAIGHT ) AND IT BENT AND I HEARD IT CRACK I STAYED IN SCHOOL WITH IT ... GOING 2 SEE IF IT'S BROKE .. IT HURTS ! 
Trying to break a fall by putting your hand out in front of you seems almost instinctive . But the force of the fall could travel up the lower forearm bones and dislocate the elbow . It also could break the smaller bone ( radius ) in the forearm . A break can occur near the elbow at the radial \head . \ " That wat happened 2 me :( " 
arm hurts but is getting better .. going to orthopedics nxt week wednesday 
omg i need a vacation from school !! Can't w8 till spring break !!! 
Tonight was fun .. had airsoft war with izzy < PROPFIRST > dawson < PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > and jaquie ( idk how 2 spell ) I have diffeent thoughts about two ppl though .. 
Ugh .. have to sit out of gym for a month .. I hate it .. I want to run ! And doc said it will take months to get full extention back but it will still hurt everyday and when I'm older It's going to hurt even more .. :[ * sigh * the little accidents tht can happen can ruin so many things .. 
I'm now relizing it really is true that you don't know what you've got until it's gone and how lies can ruin something that you wanted all your life and how 1 mistake can destroy something you don't want to let go . -_- 
Not a very good easter .. couldnt have a family easter bcuz grandma is in thehospital again with the same thing :( not doing so well hope its not a brain tumor or anything since they cant do a MRI .. i prayed for you in church easter morning .. hope you feel better 
O god sinus returns for the spring .. pressure all over , runny nose , coughing , sneezing yay

Bored ... too bad everyone has soccer and all that ... Was gonna go to < PROPFIRST > Dawson's but he has soccer till 7 or something ... Izzy is in the dells ... Why is everyone so busy ?? 0 . o

Confused . 
I didn't do anything at all so why do I deserve to be called a bitch like 4 times in front of my face when I don't even say anything back ... I didn't do anything or say anything ... People in this world can probably be catagorized in 4 words .... Players , Immature people , Tools , and Dicks .
