Just got home with my new red Ford Ranger 4x4 :) 

Is going to make a pot of chili and a batch of cornbread to go with it :)

Homeless go without eating . Elderly go without needed medicines . Mentally ill go without treatment . Troops go without proper equipment . Veterans go without benefits that were promised !! Yet we donate billions to other countries before helping our own first !!!! 1% will re-post and 99% of the people on Facebook won't have the spine or guts to re-post this to their wall . I KNOW I'm the 1%er , what about you ? 
Looking forward to the early Spring that Punxsutawney < PROPMALE > predicted :)
