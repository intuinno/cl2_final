Snow ! >:{ D 
sold his sole for a sock . 
just went 30 minutes without realizing that iTunes was repeating the same song over and over . x_x 
Twitter is going nuts with all the #iranelection commotion . What kind of crazy world are we in where the media doesn't give a f@*k and the internet is overflowing with people that care ? 
thinks apathy tastes quite bitter . You seem to feel indifferent about it . Hmm . 
is seeing social networking sites change . #iranelection 
is helping Iranians along with millions of others on twitter by RTing information , and if I knew how to set up a proxy I'd do that too . What are you doing ? 
thinks twitter is the best thing ever . No more filtered , biased , profit-concerned stories that dance around the issue . Now we know the truth from the people living it . >:O 
“A dreamer is one who can only find his way by moonlight , and his punishment is that he sees the < PROPFEMALE > before the rest of the world . ” 
is losing his mind , but it's all good . 
is reading Infinite Jest for \Infinite Summer\ " . <3 <3 <3 " 
RIP < PROPFIRST > Mays . The Reaper now has a complete superhero team : one of < PROPFIRST>'s Angels , the < PROPMALE > of Pop , and the Man Who Can Sell Anything . We're doomed . x_x 
loves Skype , but wishes more people used it . :P 
is totally a Mudkipz . :D 
wishes he could see you as a window rather than a mirror , but no one ever said life was fair . <3 
stopped learning and started understanding . 
is having a Midsummer night's dream , a particularly lucid one at that . <3

is doing something . 
is in love with Parasyte . :D 
is building a time machine and setting sail for the 1990's . Goodbye ! 
is sailing along the coast of 1969 , the air is thick but the music's fine . 
is rolling with the punches and dancing with the kicks . 
is having one of those moments where you hear a word for the first time , and it's a really weird one , then for the rest of the day you keep seeing that word everywhere . 
punched a guy and tasered a lady , then got arrested for impersonating a police officer . xD 
wants a quiet mind . 
is having a < PROPFEMALE > marathon . 
can't watch FlashForward or Supernatural because of the news over-coverage of these storms . x_x 
No matter where you go or what you do , you live your entire life within the confines of your head . ~ Terry Josephson 
wonders why everyone is so preoccupied with the end of the world . If movies have taught us anything , it's that things don't really get interesting until after doomsday . ^_^ 
YWS Chat party ! For serious ! 
loves the feeling of finally understanding things you've known all along . 
is listening to Industrial Steampunk music ? Yes ! 
Somewhere on the other side of the universe , there's a sentient being trying to convince one of its friends that I don't exist . 
is enjoying a nice Full Metal Alchemist marathon . :D 
is excited for NaNoWriMo , how about you ? 
would like you to be his Deus Ex Machina , pretty please ? 
“The best thing about dreams is that fleeting moment , when you are between asleep and awake , when you don't know the difference between reality and fantasy , when for just that one moment you feel with your entire soul that the dream is reality , and it really happened . ” 
just found the coolest band ever , Eyeshine , and the lead singer is an anime voice actor ! <3 
is playing some WoW . Well , technically I'm just spamming those Mr. T Mohawk gernades , but don't tell anyone . :P 
is reading < PROPMALE > Potter and Snape kills < PROPFEMALE > Murphy . o_o 
Just discovered The Legend of the Seeker . :{ O 
Snow ! 
Happy Lootday , hope you got the epics you've been questing for all year . :{ B 
Had a great time bringing in the New Year ( and playing < PROPFIRST > Kart ) at the < PROPFIRST>'s house . Hope everyone had a good one . :D 
If any YWS people want to help with a writing project , check my blog at YWS . :{ B 
is collecting people for nefarious purposes . >:{ V 
found a really cool game he wants to play , it's even better than chess . :{ B 
thinks Spore is braincrack laser-burned onto CDs . x_x 
Why is it that the people who complain about their free speech being taken away are the same people that try to ban any book they don't like ? x_x 
Welcome to the world , Yetibaby ! 
If I don't wield the sword , I can't protect you . If I keep wielding the sword , I can't embrace you . 
Please put this on your status if you know someone ( or are related to someone ) who has been eaten by dragons . My wish for 2010 is that people will understand that being eaten by dragons is not something to be ashamed of . Dragons are nearly unstoppable and are truly terrifying . 93% won't copy and paste this .. because they have already been eaten by dragons . 
Anyone have some anime suggestions ? I kinda ran out of shows . xD 
late night Skype parties FTW . xD 
Hulu has all 4 Seasons of Lost up ( 104 episodes counting the episode last night) ! I might actually catch up and not feel as Lost as I normally do . xD 
hates when people complain about the world never doing anything for them because more than likely they've never done anything for it either . x_x 
Anybody else going to DrakeCon tomorrow ? I'll be sure to look for you . :{ D 
will be at DrakeCon all day today , so if you're going send me a text or keep an eye out . ;) 
met a Voice Actor who looks and sounds almost exactly like < PROPFIRST > H . < PROPFIRST > XVII , and started out on the radio . If < PROPFIRST > Hebert and him stood next to each other time would surely rift . xD 
Dear Facebook , stop changing every time we get used to you . You're the only website I know that gets worse with each upgrade . P.S. You fail . 
My favorite type of people are the ones that turn mirrors into windows . 
Avatar looked amazing , but the dialogue was corny and the plot never surprised me . >_> 
We're all a bunch of mirrors pretending to be windows . 
thinks people should only speak for themselves and mind their own business . x_x 
Everything that can happen will happen in the multiverse - an infinite number of times . 
Off to AAF , hoping they have the stuff I need . :D 
10-foot tall < PROPFIRST > Skellington cosplayer ? Check . Epic masked bodybuilding dancer ? Check . Almost sorta kinda maybe dead from Arkansas Anime Festival ? Check . 
When the hamster ball you're caught in is so big you can only see the part below your feet , you tend to forget you're really just running nowhere . 
You know those moments you always wished would happen in whatever it is you were reading ? The ones that usually only end up in crappy fanfiction ? One of those moments just happened . * reads more Bleach * 
We have eyes so we can see the cold , hard truth : the world is full of suffering , pain , hatred , and death . We have hands so we can change that truth . 
Why should we be afriad of the dark when it's the light that tricks us with illusions and mirages ? 
Just saw the new episodes of Doctor Who . < PROPMALE > Smith is brilliant ! :O 
What do you do when you can't sleep at 2am ? Stratagize for the upcoming zombie apocalypse , of course . xD 
The < PROPFEMALE > Rule : Those with the gold are the ones that rule . x_x 
If you look at the number 3.14 in the mirror , it looks like PI . E , which is quite lolzy . xD 
Why are all the good anime so short ? * sadface * ( Summer Wars and < PROPFEMALE > of the East are epic beyond belief ) 
thinks Durarara !! and Welcome to the N.H.K. are epic anime . :{ D 
So you've waited all these years , come up with outlandish theories , gotten sad when your favorite characters died , only to find out they were all dead from the start ... Bwahahahahaha !! xD 
\No . Humans will die out . We're weak . Dinosaurs survived on rotten flesh . You got diarrhea last week from a Wendy's . \ " Best . Quote . Ever . xD "

Just caught up on watching Season 3 of < PROPMALE > . Woah ! :O 
thinks Stargate Universe is finally getting interesting and there's only one episode left . Wish the pacing was a little less like BSG . x_x 
Umm . So yeah . Google Wave is freaking amazing . :O 
Only one more episode left of Durarara !! :'( 
Time to watch this week's episode of Doctor Who . :O 
Chaos ; Head is one of those shows that are awesome , but way too short . :( 
Started using firefox addon called Yoono . It's like a sidebar thingy with all the facebook/twitter/youtube/etc updates all in one feed . :O 
I need a new tv series or anime to watch , pretty sure I've run out things to watch . Any suggestions ? :/ 
So I've got a missed call on my phone , but I don't recognise the number . Though the only number I can remember is my own , so that's not saying much . xD 
Ohh . Tokyo Majin is a pretty cool show . :O 
Stupid Megavideo , always cutting off when things are getting good . x_x 
Stupid new phone isn't working right . x_x 
Nevermind I figured it out . xD 
Paranormal Activity 2 ... think it'll be any good ? 
Making the jump to a smart phone is like going from dial-up to broadband . O-O 
20th Century Boys is an epic movie trilogy and an even better manga series . Check it out . xD 
Found a site that streams japanese tv/movies . They have some epic stuff . 
Oklahoma is like one giant internet dead zone . You know , except for the fact that I'm using it right now . xD 
I thought people were joking about how bad The Last Airbender movie was , but they weren't . It's worse than the Twilight series movies . Just go watch the cartoon , it's way better . x_x 
Cowboys and monkeys . Only in Eureka . 
The summer season of anime looks promising , especially Highschool of the Dead and Seikimatsu Occult Gakuin . :D 
Since when is there a new Digimon series ? :O 
Does anybody else feel like they're waiting for something exciting to happen ? :/ 
Ahh . New software is always happy fun time . xD 
Since when has < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > been doing manga/anime ? It's actually pretty good compared to the saturday morning cartoons we have here . :O 
\The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with \ 
I think I might be using Limewire just a bit too much . xD 
Ideas you have when you're trying to sleep always seem cool in the moment , but tend to end up being stupid or overly complicated in the morning . Maybe this one won't end up like that . xD 
It's so rare to see an anime rise above its tropes , but it still happens . xD 
Inception made my brain hurt , in a good way . xD 
Thor trailer ! :O 
Sometimes technology makes me so angry I want to break things . This'll come in handy when robots take over . p_o 
First two dubbed episodes of < PROPFEMALE > of the East are up at Funimation . :O 
Talking to random internet people on Skype is fun . :D 
Miyazaki marathon ? Yup yup . 
Going to sleep before midnight ? Must be sick or something . xD 
Asleep by 11 and awake by 7 . Yup , must be sick . xD 
Weren't we supposed to have flying cars , giant fighting robots , and virtual reality by the 21st century ? All we've got so far is a touchscreen phone that can't even play Flash (>_>) . The future always seems so much cooler when it isn't the present . xD 
Bleh . Nosebleeds are just too messy . >_> 
Just discovered Newgrounds audio portal . :O 
Twitter has calloused me to the point that I assume any famous person who Trends must have died . xD 
Nothing like a good nap to keep you up most of the night . xD 
Artificial flavoring comes with its pros and cons : Sometimes you get cookie dough ice cream and sometimes you get spicey nacho popcorn . >_> 
\Flying is learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss . \ " \ 
I don't procrastinate . My attention span simply time-travels from now until the night before something needs to be finished . Pretty cool , huh ? xD 
Decided to start learning Japanese so I don't have to read subtitles when I watch anime . Still trying to figure out if that's being lazy or productive ? @_@ 
Today seems like a bleh kinda day . >_> 
Sometimes I wish Google was smart enough to just read my mind and find what I'm looking for instead of looking through < PROPFEMALE > after < PROPFEMALE > of useless websites . Then I read somewhere that someone's made a robot that can express emotions and have nightmares about Skynet . xD 
What happened to the good old days when nobody payed attention to the internet ? It's so bland and copyrighty now . Can't even stream a movie without taking 20 minutes to find a working link . :'( 
Need to use Skype more often . xD 
Oh Drama Llama , how you spit upon us all . xD 
It's weird when you notice having one less friend on Facebook , but can't figure out who dropped out . xD 
Right now is a weird time to live in . We've got all this cool technology to spur our imaginations , but none of the capabilities to make them a reality . :'( 
Seeing all the stuff going on in NYC , I'm starting to think 9/11 didn't bring us closer together as a nation . Pretty sure it just pushed our anger , prejudice , and stupidity into a magnifying lens and shot it out as a doomsday lazer . x_x 
So they were like \blah blah blah\ " and he was like \ " pew pew pew\ " and then they weren't anymore . xD " 
Just watched the pilot for ABC's No Ordinary Family . It's got that quirky weird abc vibe , but it looks promising . Especially the epic teleporting guman vs the invincible guy . Guess I found my replacement for Heroes this year . ^_^ 
What I got out of Apple's event thingy : They announced 4.1 , which fixes the bugs from the release in June , but it doesn't come out until November . GameCenter looks epic , iTunes goes social networking , and < PROPMALE > Jobs is still a pretentious jerkface . ^_^ 
If you haven't already , go over to Apple and download iTunes 10 . It's all jazzy looking and < PROPFEMALE > is kinda epic . :O 
Gotta love that Creative Commons License . :D 
If you've got < PROPFEMALE > up and running feel free to add me . :{ D 
I think my brain's going to explode with fantasy sometime soon . The next 15 ~ books in queue are all epics . xD 
Things are always changing , they're just changing the exact same way each time . xD 
Starting ' The Way of Kings ' by < PROPFIRST > Sanderson . 1008 pages of pure epic fantasy . :{ D 
Any fantasy people out there should read The Way of Kings by < PROPFIRST > Sanderson . It's like nothing I've ever read before . :O 
Remember the story about the chick who threw puppies in the river , then some old lady saved the puppies that washed up downriver ? The old lady was friends with puppy chick and the puppies are still dead . Oh , and 4chan is raging once again . xD 
Argh . Slow internet is slow . :'( 
Seems like everything happens on Thursday , then I'm just stuck being bored for the other six days . >_> 
Discovering an internet hoax and following it across the interweb is like reading a good mystery novel , except there are a lot more pictures and the occasional youtube break . xD 
Happy Birthday , < PROPFIRST > ! Here's to another 25 years of goomba-stomping . * cheers *

Did anyone else know that . tk was the domain thingy for Tokelau , a territory in New Zealand ? I always thought it stood for telekinesis or something . Speaking of domains , when are we goign to get stuff like . omg , . ftw , and . lol ? xD

So they're releasing all the < PROPFEMALE > Wars movies at theaters in 3D one at a time starting in 2012 . At least they made a smart move in doing 4-6 first so people will actually buy tickets the first three years . xD 
Ever since Hulu came around using the television just seems weird and outdated . xD 
< PROPMALE > Snyder directing and < PROPFIRST > < PROPMALE > screenwriting the new Superman movie , with General Zod as the baddie . Epic . :O 
New Twitter looks cool , but the symmetry is all off now . Weird . But at least they've got cooler themes . 
Just re-read Deathly Hallows . Now I wish I had a time machine so I could go back to the days when people actually stood in line for hours just to get a book . That , and maybe brainwash Rowling into changing the epilogue . xD 
Please put this as\

Myspace did a revamp ? Looks kind of cool , sorta . >_< 
Apple announced Lion , which seems more like a face-lift than an actual OS version . Funny thing is that I'm more excited about the possibility of a OS X Liger in the future than ' OS X App Store ' . >_> 
Skyline is a really great sci-fi movie , with a really cool ending . Mostly for people who liked Cloverfield . xD 
\Guess what ? I have flaws . What are they ? Oh I dunno

A2F is this weekend , anybody else plan on going ? 
Apparently , iTunes works a lot better when the computer isn't on mute . x_x 
This is the weirdest anime I've ever seen . A ' kid ' riding around on a talking motorcycle then having dinner in a robot city and running into a group of telepathic hermits . So why can't I stop watching it ? @_@ 
Why do naps make me even more tired ? x_x 
To everyone celebrating Thanksgiving , have a great holiday ! To everyone else , have a great day/night depending on where you are . :D 
My old AOL account is emailing people all on its own . I wouldn't be surprised if Google , Youtube , Facebook , and all the email providers are just umbrella companies of Skynet . >_> 
73 downloads on iTunes , each ~ 200MB . x_x 
Cartoons are taking over facebook . xD 
Usually the people shouting about freedom of speech are the same people who censor anything they don't want to hear . x_x 
Tonight's Community was epic , The Office too . xD 
I need to find some new shows to watch . >_> 
If it's going to be this cold all the time , it might as well snow a bit . x_x 
I think Firefox broke . x_x 
Skype is cool .

Firefox decided not to be stupid anymore , so back to the cool browser with all the add-ons . :D

I'm starting to think when UPS says ' 2-day shipping ' they count the day it gets sent out as one day and whenever it happens to get here as the second . x_x 
There are only 10 types of people in the world — those who understand binary , and those who don't . 
Is tomorrow the first day of two-thousand and eleven , twenty-eleven , or just eleven ? Anybody know how this works ? @_@ 
Ughh . People aren't supposed to be up this early . x_x

Why doesn't wii bowling skill transfer . x_x 
Just found an easter egg hidden inside youtube videos . When a video is play , if you press the right and up arrow keys at the same time ( should make the video jump ahead a bit ) it lets you play that Snake game that's on some cellphones right on top of the video . xD 
Any other time , 10 minutes of a spinning rainbow pinwheel wouldn't be so bad . Apples . x_x 
Woohoo . Broken computer isn't broken , just takes 20 minutes to go from start-up screen to desktop . >_< 
Solving a rubix cube blindfolded seems like an easier task than fixing this stupid computer . x_x 
I think I understand why everyone hates Monday now . >_< 
I think my headache is getting a headache . T_T 
It's quiet , too quiet . 
It was such a good movie until the ending came along . >_> 
It's always fun looking through forums for the stereotypical members . xD 
Ideas are fun to get , but then you find out how much work it'll take and just decide procrastination sounds like an even better idea . xD 
The english dub on this show is really bad . Back to subtitles . x_x 
Weather is really weird now . Summery weather today , then a < PROPMALE > of significant ice and snow Tuesday and Wednesday . Tornadoes on New Years Day too . Maybe there really is a weather machine in Alaska . @_@ 
' Snowpocalypse 2011 ' coming to an outside near you . ( check your local sky for showtime listings )
