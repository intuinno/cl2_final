Tell me- is the glass half empty or half full ? 
The glass is always half empty . I'm not a pessimist- I'm a philosopher . 
people just don't understand . 
I have now lost a friend . No , not a friend . I have lost a family member .... 
hmmmm ... not sure what to say ... 
people accuse me of doing something , but then they don't tell me what i'm doing wrong ... wait isn't that against my 5th amendment right ? 
I don't ask for people to like me , hate me , forgive me , love me , or anything- I just ask for a bit of respect . 
Interpretation and perspective of a few words and actions can really screw up a friendship ...
