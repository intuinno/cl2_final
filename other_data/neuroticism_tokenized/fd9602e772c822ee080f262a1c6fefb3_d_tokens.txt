I just got 6 stitches in my head from walking into a scoreboard ... 
I got vibraphone mallets yesterday !

... friend like this . 
I got a grand total of 2 hours of sleep last night ...

People who need a smack upside the head affect the lives of many .

I'm bored . Someone entertain me ...

WHY DOESN'T CHAT WANNA WORK ?! 
Did you ever think about this ? \ 
You can never have more than one twin . \ 
Never have more or less than two triplets . 
I'm in one of the worst moods I've been in in a while . I want to be left alone ... 
IMMA LITTLE NEKO CHIBI !!! 
Goodbye , dear aunt , I'll miss your farm . And Eustace's eboliant charm . And farewell , Courage , what's the harm ? If I was slightly ... naughty . With love , < PROPFIRST > . 
He's gone , and I don't think anyone could be happier . 
I turn off my XBox , and the TV immediately plays Bad Romance ! This makes me RAGE !!! 
I seem to have lost power ... 
My hair is 2/3 of the way done ! 
How much longer must my shower water be pink ? It's so immaculating !!! 
So I heard you had sisters ? \ 
Bow chicka ... \ 
Who are twins ? \ 
Wow wow !!! 
CHALLENGE COMPLETE !!! \ 
I was at 499 songs on Osu !, so Zim said I needed to be at an even 500 . It took a while , but I found one with only one map ! I WIN !!! 
Turns out , I can download 100 Osu ! maps in a day , no problem ! 
I'm in the worst mood I've been in in my life . Piss me off , and you WILL NOT like the consequences . 
I need a hug ... 
The pinkish color in my hair is fading , and it's incredibly sexy !!! 
I'm going to have < PROPFEMALE > much fun ... I just got an English copy of Vocaloid 2 , so once I figure out how to get it to work , I'll use it with MikuMikuDance , and I'll make my own Vocaloid songs !!! 
FML ... I download MMD , make a 4 minute long video ( a simple one , but it still took hours ... ) , and when I hit record , I'm missing MMDxShow . dll in the Data folder . UGHHH !!! >.< 
< PROPFEMALE > Kisaragi and I had the best Continuum Shift fight ever . I was Litchi , he was Carl . \ 
He tried to pull The Clap off , repeatedly . I dodged the very last one in the match , and said ... \ 
\The benefit of playing a stripper is that I already HAVE the clap !!! IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK ON ME !!! \ " \ 
Finally got Reach yesterday ... TOOK ME LONG ENOUGH !!! 
I will NEVER solo level 6 of Reach on Legendary again . 2 hours of my life , GONE ! 
WHO ELSE IS BORED ?! 
I hate people who don't let another person have a second chance . \ 
You know who you are . And I doubt you'd read this anyways . 
99 RED BALLOONS IS ON THE RADIO !!! 
I managed to get a trojan virus somehow . I'll get back on the internet once I figure things out , and fix it . 
I love you < PROPFEMALE > . 
Which of the 5 elements are you gifted with ? - My Result : You are SPIRIT ! http://bit.ly/9VVRvf 
Bwahaha ... I have Vocaloid 2 , AND Fruity Loops 9 XXL now !!! TIEM TO MAEK TEH TEHCNO !!! 
It seems my power went out ... 
I'm ACTUALLY watching Dr. Oz ... \ 
I have yet to learn anything ... 
The new Dashboard update for the 360 is retarded ... WHY SO BRIGHT ? \ 
Hopefully Red was right when he said there were color changes coming in December . 
We got Force Unleashed 2 when I wasn't looking ... \ 
WHY DON'T PEOPLE TELL ME THESE THINGS ?!?!?! 
I just finished The Force Unleashed 2 on hard . Time to try Unleashed , and this time , get the Light Side ending . 
I'm not getting notifications much anymore . I feel unloved . 
Oh my god ! < PROPMALE>'s Lab is on !!! 
Bored ... \ 
Bored . \ 
Bored ! \ 
BORED !!! \ 
Did I mention I was bored ? 
I just saw the Easter Egg in Reach that makes it so you don't have to fight your way through the club ! Legendary Solo ? HERE I COME ! 
Grr ... I hate Fallout : New Vegas sometimes ... \ 
So many glitches ... I had to raise a Bomber Plane out of a lake , and it won't let me detonate the flotation devices ... 
I love Black Ops . What other game lets you fight Zombies as Nixon , Kennedy , < PROPMALE > Castro , and McNamara in the Pentagon ? 
finished the campaign of Black Ops last night . It may be short , but dear God , plot twist ... I kinda saw it coming , but still . Now time for harder difficulties . 
I get to go see Trans-Siberian Orchestra tomorrow ! < PROPFEMALE > Watts had better remember ! 
I just got back from Trans-Siberian Orchestra . \ 
I can now die happy , my life is complete . 
I now have 2010 beatmaps in Osu ! This is a momentous occasion ! 
Yay ! I have most of the Vocaloid2 voices ! Time to find the rest ! 
Halo Reach Weekly Challenge . \ 
16,000 points . \ 
This is DEFINITELY a Halo week for me . 
I just got back from the new < PROPMALE > Potter ... \ 
I nearly cried ... 
< PROPFEMALE > bored ...

Announcer : One of the many possibilities of the Continuum Shift . \ 
-GAME OVER-\ 
New Story Unlocked : < PROPMALE > Hankins 
Don't mess with me . I'm NOT in the mood for it . 
I know I said I was pissed yesterday , but then I got better . It's even worse now . Don't even bother talking to me . You know who you are . 
Okay , so let's say Obama does a Presidential speech . But no one seems to like the new announcement . \ 
< PROPFIRST > Caruso walks in . He says :\ 
\I guess this is an ... \ " He puts on a pair of shades . \ " Obama-Nation\ " . \ 
TG : this shits more real than kraft mayo \ 
^Best quote ever . I need to make this a motto of mine ... 
I finally got Valkenhayn ! And I'm doing decent in his challenges ! I've gotten 4 ( yes , that's sad ... I know ... ) and it's better than all my others ! 
Best quote ever : If you can't figure shit out by fucking around , you don't belong near computers . It's kind of like with schools , and registered sex offenders . 
Grr ... Now my computer is telling me that another computer with the same IP address is on my network ... I have to use the neighbor's wifi . Someone figure this out , because I have no clue why this is happening . 
So bored . Need entertainment . 
I keep getting emails that aren't addressed to me ... They all go to an address ldb1 *** , each * marks a random number . I hate spammers . I may need to make a new email account ... Lots of extra work ... 
Now I'm going for the true boss ending of Aria of Sorrow . Possible video later . 
I don't know how I've survived 17 years without Nightcore . I LOVE their remixes ! 
< PROPMALE > Hankins , < PROPFEMALE > Haku Kisaragi , and < PROPFEMALE > Vermillion , I don't know what you guys are talking about . My day has been pretty good . 
I think I've decided . Next time I get my hair cut , I want it cut like Zexion , from Kingdom Hearts . 
< PROPMALE > Hankins , < PROPFEMALE > Haku Kisaragi , and < PROPFEMALE > Vermillion were right . Today did turn out to suck . I'm not sure who I can trust anymore ... 
Just finished my Christmas Line < PROPMALE > , but I'm not uploading it until midnight Christmas Morning , my time . 
Nyaaah ... < PROPMALE > can't find his DS ... 
I'm playing Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days on a pink DS Lite ! NO ONE CAN STOP ME ! 
I may not seem the same for the next few days ... I just want to be alone ... I don't feel like eating , I don't feel like getting out of bed , I don't feel like talking to anyone ... I wish I could go to sleep , and just make it all go away ... 
Is it just me , or are all the good RP profiles suddenly deciding to delete their characters ? 
I've wanted to replay the first Kingdom Hearts again . Today , I finally decided to get an iso file for it . I figured out how to get it working in the emulator I have for the PS2 , and it runs just fine . I played far enough to fight Riku in the beginning , and randomly throughout the fight , it drops to half the speed of the original . Dear GOD , the lag ! I'll look up configurations to make it run faster tomorrow . 
Finally working towards finishing the redo of my last lineart . 
Just finished my first ( somewhat ) successful attempt at making a song sound like Nightcore . Uploading a video soon . 
Grr ... I hate uploading videos in Facebook . It's so evil , sometimes . 
I'm going to save up another $50 , and get a Bamboo tablet , so I can work on my < PROPMALE > a bit more ! ^_^ 
Someone pick a song ! I have an urge to Nightcore something !!! 
I really hate when people just assume something , because they have all the information in front of them , but can't be bothered with reading it . 
I have 419 friends on facebook but when you need them , how many of them will be there for you ? Click ' LIKE ' if you'll be there for me . Put this as your status and see how many will be there for you . 
Got a new TV , a Treble Clef wall decoration , a digital camera , a music-themed blanket , and a Pillow Pet . Yes , a Pillow Pet . It's a monkey . \ 
Anyways , I spent the money I've gotten so far , to order a refurbished Bamboo Pen and Touch tablet . It should be arriving between the 28th , and the 3rd . 
< PROPFEMALE > Christmas ! Who wants to unwrap me ? 
I just discovered the best thing ever . Bunk bed futons . Put me down for 3 . 
To everyone I was talking to , my computer overheated . I'll be back in a bit . 
YAY ! MY TABLET ARRIVED ! 
I'm used to the tablet , now . 
-has been playing Touhou-\ 
The next day :\ 
-feels bad that I'm shooting Lolis- 
Let's see how creative my facebook friends are . Leave me a one word comment that best describes me using the THIRD letter of your FIRST name . It can only be one word . Then copy and paste this to your wall so I can leave a word about you . Don't just post a word and not copy ; that's no fun ! 
Distance is the worst thing in the world ... If I could , I'd be out of here now , on my way to see you ... I need a hug ... 
One of these days , I want to travel the world ... 
Grr ... The cable guy came and fixed our internet , and now the Xbox refuses to connect ... 
I need MS points ... -pouts- 
Is suicide the \in\ " thing now ? Everyone seems to be doing it . \ 
Turns out I have high blood pressure . I'll be spending less time on here , and more time exercising now . 
Today , I bought a pillow . In the shape of the Oscar-Mayer Weinermobile . Everyone wins . 
A few days after Dead Space 2 comes out ... I finally beat the first one . 
Screw the medusa head soul . The final guard soul makes me virtually invincible ! 
I was on Cleverbot.com . Here was my conversation . \ 
What have you done with my dish towel ? \ 
I threw it away . \ 
Why ? \ 
Because it was too dirty . \ 
Your new name is Bob . \ 
Apparently I'm < PROPMALE > now . 
So , I got < PROPMALE>'s Kunai to level 9 . It's SCARY . 
Dead or Alive 4 , ordered . I'll be playing that when it comes in , and tomorrow , I should be getting points . 
Just finished my newest lineart . Uploading soon . 
I don't know how it happened , but I must have fallen asleep . I remember doing stuff , but I just now woke up . So strange . 
Certain people ... They just need sense slapped into them . 
Soon , I've decided I'm going to take requests on backgrounds , for basically anything you can think of . Give me a suggestion , and I'll see if I can find the appropriate pictures to work with . 
Grr ... It's SO difficult to get my tablet to work on my TV only , while my laptop is the secondary monitor ... 
DoA 4 . \ 
< PROPFEMALE > Haku Kisaragi was on an 18 win streak , and he needed 20 to get an achievement . I show up , and kill him . He's salty . 
PSP x1 , obtained . \ 
Final Fantasy : Crisis Core x1 , obtained . \ 
Memory Stick x1 , did not obtain . \ 
-facepalms- 
Happy < PROPFIRST>'s Day/Singles Awareness Day , everyone ! 
Should I feel bad ? In Crisis core , I fused a Materia called Osmose . It drains MP . On top of that , I threw in enough crap to give me +160% health . I have crap otherwise , because of it . 
Played 10 hours of Crisis Core . I just now saved for the first time . 
Okay , now I have a materia , that has +300% health ... Overkill , much ? 
I just got the stupidest message ever . Someone was being rude , and I told them about it , now they're deleting me because they think I'm a jerk . \ 
I'll post it in the comments . 
I just finished Crisis Core . If I hadn't seen the ending before , I would have cried ... 
Trying to figure out how to make a custom theme for Google Chrome . I hate how some of these guides are written by people that don't know what they're doing . 
I played TF2 for the first time in a while yesterday . \ 
< PROPMALE > Mochrie shot me while I tried to beat him to death with a fish . \ 
Yes , this DID happen . 
I feel accomplished . I got completion on Symphony of the Night , before a friend of mine even got a single achievement , and he had the game MONTHS before I did . 
Finally started watching Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt . The Saving Private < PROPFIRST > parody for the second half of episode 3 is the BEST thing I've ever seen . 
I just finished Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt . \ 
I did not like that ending at ALL . 
FINALLY made my first flash game . It's crappy , but I finally figured out buttons . It only took me an hour or so . \ 
And I'd like to add ... BOOLE TAUGHT ME NOTHING ! 
Some people are just jerks . I don't mind if people go and hate me for whatever reason . I deal with it , it's not too bad . Removing all ties between two people ? So be it . But taking a private matter public ? That's too far . I will NOT stand for it . I wish he could read this , because it would warn him that his life is RUINED . 
Who knows of a good site to have a message board hosted ? I want to set up a new one , because my old one kinda died ... 
I'm going to stream the rest of the lineart I was working on last night . It shouldn't be too long from now . 
Randomly got a Tumblr account . No clue why , just felt I should have one . 
Wheel of fortune just came on . I randomly had a great idea . \ 
I'm going to make a series of videos or something , called Wheel of 4Chan . I don't really like 4Chan , but this could be LOTS of fun . 
Once I add the characters I'm downloading , who wants to see a stream of Mugen ? 
I'm warning the rest of you now . NEVER send me a message that is shared with more than 5-10 people . I'm sick of getting text messages every 5 seconds , and I'm not taking my notifications off , because it's the only way some people can reach me . Next time someone does it , I will PERSONALLY KICK YOUR FACE IN . 
It's amazing what an hour of sleep can do , when you didn't sleep at all the night before . 
I forgot to say this earlier , but HAPPY PI DAY ! 
So ... I think I found a way to connect my PSP to online AdHoc play , without a PS3 . I just need someone else that knows it works , and a game to test it with ... 
Anyone else you XLink < PROPFEMALE > for their PSP ? And if so , what games ? I need to think of some good games to buy , to use for it . 
Today , I went out and bought DJ < PROPMALE > Fever . I found a copy for only $10 . \ 
Did I mention I DROVE there , and paid with MY money ? \ 
I feel like a big boy , now . 
So , if I were to stream the original Half Life game , who would be interested in watching me fail ? 
Just beat < PROPFEMALE > on DJ < PROPMALE > Fever . My thumbs hurt . 
I MAY start up the Half Life stream soon , depending on how many people wanna see it now , or wait . 
Single or not , put this as your status and see what color people inbox you :) Black = i want a relationship , Green = im falling for you . Purple = i miss you . Orange = i really like you . Pink = i love you . Yellow = your amazing . Blue = your beautiful . Grey = we need to speak more ;) 
Who else knows the full Pokemon theme lyrics ? And I don't mean the ones from the show . I mean the full three chorus version . 
Let's try again , and NOT be too literal : \ 
Who else knows the full version of the Pokemon theme ? Not the version from the show , but the full studio version , with 3 choruses . Chorusi ? Something . 
Who wants to watch a stream of me going through random websites , and destroying them ? Katamari style . 
Thinking about deleting all my old YouTube videos , to replace them with something more interesting . They aren't very good quality in the first place . 
Guess who sold enough games to buy Duodecim , the last copy of Birth By Sleep , and almost fully pay off Saints Row 3 , AND Skyrim ? \ 
This guy . 
Just got to the first chapter with Yuna , in Duodecim . \ 
For the record , Yuna is BEAST . 
I've officially completed Cycle 12 of Duodecim . Now for the rest of the game . 
I'm watching Jackass 3 with my sister . I can NOT stop laughing . I don't know why ... 
Am I the only one that realized that in each Story in Duodecim , on the world map , there's a chest , pertaining to the year the original game using that character was released ? I was just playing through Tidus's story , and realized it , when I got 2001 < PROPMALE > in a chest . I've seen it in other story modes , but I never really thought about it . 
YOU JUST WOKE UP NAKED IN BED NEXT TO ME . \ 
Using only 3 words , \ 
what would you say to me ? \ 
Note : if you comment , you must copy and paste that as your status , so i can comment on yours as well 
Played Dance Central for about 4 hours last night/this morning . Awesome game . I swear I lost like , 40 pounds . 
P O K E : Me if you've ever had a crush on me , or still do . \ 
L I K E : This status if you think I'm a good friend . \ 
I N B O X : Me if you've ever wanted a relationship with me , or still do . \ 
C O M M E N T : On this status if we've had some good memories . \ 
IF YOU ARE BRAVE ENOUGH : Put this as your status and see what you get 
I'm going to play Audiosurf to random songs , and stream it , whether you like it or not ! 
In my newest pic , who wants to be my squirrel friend ? I'm fairly certain it has to be male , but it's fairly androgynous . Ask , and I'll consider my options . Whoever I choose gets to pick the color scheme . 
People , list some anime . I'm going somewhere with limited internet access Friday , so I want to torrent as much anime as possible to watch before then . 
I'm at my grandparent's house , now . Expect me to be on , just not much at all . Mostly to check Facebook , DeviantART , and MSPA . \ 
Oh , and I beat the 12th cycle in Duodecim , and now I'm working on Scenario 000 , with my level 80 Zidane ( Who I didn't transfer over , I just leveled him like crazy in the last campaign ) . 
You know that feeling you have when you forget something ? I apparently forgot my PSP charger .
