Thanks Dad/Brittany and Easton , now I'll never get to sleep tonight . 

is kinda sorta maybe a little excited for tomorrow .... thinking that it will all work out 
is off to Hurricane Harbor with < PROPFIRST > :) 
wants to do something . Soooo bored . 
needs to stop watching Americas Next Top Model but is too lazy to get up and do something 
So basically I'm about to go insane from boredom . And yet I know I'm going to miss this once all the band stuff starts . 
has never ever been quite this excited before . :) 
is so excited for tonight :) 
sleepover with my girls :) well if they could ever actually show up when I tell them to 
is kinda sad to be leaving everyone for 2 and a half weeks . 
is so glad to be home . Band camp was amazing :) 
never ever wants to get on a plane again after sharing a fourth of the seat with the lady next to her who needed a SEAT BELT EXTENSION . 
is happy , nervous , excited , and terrified all at the same time . I'm having so much fun with my cousin ( haha man-cakes ) , I'm so glad I don't have to worry about AP scores anymore , and I miss everyone a lot . 
misses the Texas heat and misses everyone back home :( 
is about ready to go crazy . I really miss Texas . 
UGGGGGHHHHH 
is going home tomorrow :) 
Best day ever 
thought that flute camp was pretty intense today . Yay piccolo clinic haha 
totally beasted the < PROPMALE > Clarke piece :) 
Its better to just forgive people and move on , then to live dwelling in the past . 
decided she might as well be like everyone else and announce that she is also going to band tomorrow :) 
Today was fun , but I'm pretty sure I'm going to collapse already . Stupid waking up at 7 AM ........ 
Apparently motivational speakers who talk really fast give me a huge headache . But he was definitely awesome . 
Grocery store then Sonic . Gotta love my parents idea of \bonding \"" 
hates it when people push her over the edge and she gets super stressed and frustrated . 
loves < PROPFIRST > and < PROPMALE > and all the other people who stayed to help her jump her car . I will owe you forever . 
loves her dad who just replaced the battery in her car . So I can actually get to Leadership Camp tomorrow ! 
< PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , and I should make shirts together more often lol :) 
loves her freshman . Oh and yall should try renaming them its super fun :) 
Mmmmmm band . It has taken over my life . 
Boys are annoying urghhhh 
still hasn't gotten that nap she talked about this morning .... urgh 
Summer reading . Only 80 something pages left in my second book :) 
is suddenly in a better mood . Thanks < PROPFIRST > :) 
is so desperate for a distraction that she is actually going to type up that essay now . 
Cicis was fun and a pretty good distraction 
Last say of summer for high school . Its kind of depressing :( 
mmmmmm school . I love when you look at the board and all you can think is wow did I really forget every bit of math I ever learned over the summer ? 
doesn't want to go to dance or do her math homework or deal with the craziness that is trying to change my schedule 
Band band band band band band tonight ..... now to do those Anatomy flash cards 
can't decide whether to be the good person and want them to be happy or be the selfish one who is still angry . As ridiculous as it sounds both alternatives basically suck . 
BTWITIAILWU ..... 
really likes A&M . Thats a shocker 
just finished typing up the survey questions AGAIN . Then off to dance :) 
So basically tomorrow should be fantastic :) 
getting ready for the game , secret sis , and totally excited and terrified for performing < PROPFIRST > for the first time tonight 
just got home after having a fantastic time at Homecoming :) 
Ok so anyone that knows < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > could you please either A give me her number or B call her and tell her to send me the project info so I can actually stop panicing ???? PLEASE ? 
is doing the AP Government project with Ash and Reina .... yay seniors who don't know anything about the Constitution 
is really proud of the fact that she actually put the photos up from Homecoming less than 2 weeks after the dance this year :) lol 
Something always brings me back to you ... it never takes too long 
Today , I had to choose between a strawberry flavored Dum Dum and a mystery flavored Dum Dum . I decided to be adventurous and choose the mystery flavor . It was strawberry flavored . MLIA - Is it bad that this made me laugh for about ten minutes ? 
- If I die , I'm blaming < PROPFIRST > Chappell :) 
just finished the Study Logs ..... AAAAAAA ! :) Thats 6 hours of my life I'll never get back . 
Good news : The hives are going down . Bad news : In order to stop them from coming back over night I would have to get up at about 3 in the morning . That isnt happening .... oh well :( 
is going to be in so much trouble tomorrow morning if the hives dont get off the bottom of my foot . Somehow I dont think the band directors will let me limp through rehearsal . 
mmmm Tailgate . Gotta love little < PROPFEMALE > short people running around screaming and cracking notes on their instruments . 
game day :) . Today went way better than I thought it would 
MOM ... I WASN'T EVEN THERE ! ( haha yes < PROPFIRST > i watched it just for you ) 
never actually stopped missing him . Its a depressing realization . 
did not see a lot of things coming lately . People never seem to do what you expect them to . 
loves discovering that instead of trying to find people for recommendation letters and writing 5 billion essays I actually only need to write 2 . And send in scores . It just made my day . 
Game time . Good luck boys :) 
Contest day . Now heres my dilemma : short sleeves or long sleeves ? 
I knew better than to let you break my heart 
Mmm Hamlet . I made it through 30 pages before falling asleep this time ! 
It has never felt better to finally tell someone everything I've always wanted to say . 
I can honestly say you've been on my mind since I woke up today ... 
So basically I cant seem to make myself do my homework . This should be fun . 
just finished writing 4 essays and submitting applications to Texas Tech and Texas A&M University . College is exhausting ... 
Thanks for the pants < PROPMALE > :) 
[ I don't want to spend another night trying to figure out why your always on my mind , Woah all I know , You keep me coming back for more ] 
Now that I've calmed down enough to think about it I guess I kind of always knew .... 
just thought of a great sin : riding the senior bus before your a senior 
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream , It's like a million little stars spelling out your name , You gotta come on , come on , say that we'll be together , come on , come on , little taste of heaven ... 
Do not pass go , do not collect 200 donuts :) 
completely forgot there was a game today until < PROPFEMALE > said she was wearing her game day shirt . It feels like we already started concert band .... 
just got accepted to Texas Tech :) and finished the really short application LSU sent me because they decided to wave the essays and fee so I might as well 
Good day :) Accepted into Texas Tech and I finished the Anatomy project 
should join TRAAAPD :) . Its soooo true . 
Thank you google . You have helped to keep me from completely freaking out . 
mmmm Government Homework ..... and NHS induction . 
Horrible day . All I want to do is sleep 
just got accepted to Texas A&M ! :) 
had the weirdest dream last night and I can't stop thinking about it . If only some of it were true .... 
The best time to wear a striped sweater , is all the time ..... haha 
has never been so happy to talk to someone on the phone in her whole life :) 
feels like someone repeatedly kicked her in the calves .... but in a good way . Good dance class :) 
The calculus test was KILLER but hey it's break now so it really doesn't seem that bad 
Most awkward moment of my life . Today on the airplane I was sitting by this cute guy who is going to Texas Tech for baseball . I fell asleep and woke up laying on his arm ..... then proceeded to pretend that nothing happened . Yay me . 
has never been more thankful to be off a plane and back home . I may feel awful but at least I'm away from whatever I'm allergic to . 
Longgggg day but at least I had fun :) 
knows she really doesn't want to do her homework when she starts stalking people via Facebook for no apparent reason :) 
The more I practice the worse I get .... I feel like it's a sign 
Te amo mi amor ...... what is it about Spanish that makes it so much more fun to say ? 
is kind of upset and confused . I thought we were close .... but maybe I was wrong . 
My nose is so stuffed up and my eyes are super itchy . It occurs to me that if it gets worse I won't be able to see my All Region music . Benadryl perhaps ? 
No more school ... please ? 
is getting that feeling you get when you didn't learn any of the material covered .... and the test is tomorrow . Guess I'll be busy all night . 
I . Hate . This . Week . 
Sweet dreams ..... 
I think I will never recover from yesterday . Yay parties :) 
needs someone to go shopping with .... soon 
She can't see the way your eyes light up when you smile .... 
You don't fool me . Stop pretending to be something you're not . 
had way more fun than she expected today . Catch phrase and extreme ERS ? Haha thanks guys . 
AAAAAAAAA SYTYCD FINALE !!!!!! 
URGH . That is all I have to say . 
You make me feel like dancing :) 
Sleepover party at < PROPFEMALE>'s house ..... haha this should be hilarious 
I've been spending all my time just thinking about you , I don't know what to do , I think I'm falling for you :) 
with my bffaeaeaeaeaeae and my biffel watching the Nanny :) 
\Soon it will be time for the initiation .... \ " - < PROPFEMALE > Luedecke " 
is so bored that she is contemplating CLEANING . Someone save me :( 
Battling armadillos ... now thats serious business :) 
I miss your hugs 
I hate the fighting and how you don't really care about my feelings or opinion . Whatever . 
Dance dance dance dance dance dance dance TONIGHT :) 
purple with multicolored flowers :) haha 
went to Bath and Body Works and everything was on sale . Fuzzy socks , perfume , and chapstick = ridiculously cheap . Yay :) 
I missed our chats < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Himes :) 
got a 32 on the ACT . Sadly , I have no idea if its too late for that to be put into consideration for scholarships from A&M . 
\Please God . I am a good person . I give money to homeless people . I even recycle ! Just let me have perfect wedding hair . \ " -Bridezilla " 
\It was like a full rainbow . Like < PROPFIRST > G BIV . \ " Thank you < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Himes for making the nerdiest comment of the night . " 
I love you < PROPFEMALE > Quillin . I'm not sure what I would do without you . 
I hate today . Seriously . 
Sometimes I wonder if you ever think of me 
My phone is most definitely not working sooo .... don't try to call or text me . Yeah . Today just keeps getting better . 
I wish I could read minds 
Today , a second grader tried to tell me he was almost taller than me . I have officially gone to a new level of shortness haha . But on the bright side , there is nothing quite like 17 kids all trying to hug you at the same time :) 
I feel both numb and horrified at the awfulness of our English book . More homework ? Yay . 
I wish I could just say something .... but somehow it is always easier to say nothing at all . 
Why is it that no matter how hard I try I can't figure out the hidden answer to the calculus homework ? If I had more than 2 answers I would most likely give up . 
I have one thing to say to you : WHY ? 
Hey < PROPFEMALE > Hatton ...... how ARE you ? haha 
Today was going great . Oh well . 
& hearts ; Tale as old as time , song as old as rhyme , beauty and the beast & hearts ; 
I love < PROPFEMALE > Luedecke and < PROPFIRST > Chappell more than words can describe . Yall are the best friends anyone could ever ask for . 
You confuse me more than you could know . 
Every time I start to complain about the weather , I think of my Dad who is in Seoul , Korea . Current temperature ? 12 degrees . Yeah I'm ok with rain . 
jiffapodjajadueocbsj URGH 
found her glasses so she won't be completely blind all day tomorrow . Haha but today was still good . 
[ And the worst part is before it gets any better we're headed for a < PROPMALE > , but in the free fall I realized I'm better off when I hit the bottom ] 
I promise you I'm always there , when your heart is filled with sorrow and despair , I'll < PROPFEMALE > you when you need a friend , you'll find my footprints in the sand .... 
Skittles from Taiwan are waaaay better than Skittles from here . Instead of grape and lime , they have blackberry and apple . I am so completely jealous . 
I hate having so much on my mind that I can't sleep . 
may start screaming soon . I want to kill this scholarship essay . 
watched a parent back into another car at Boyd .... then pull foward and back into them again . And they think we're the bad drivers ? 
And when it rains on this side of town it touches everything ... 
I'm so tired . It's funny how everything seems to spin out of control at the same time . 
They say that time heals all wounds ..... I guess I'll find out whether that's true . I'm always here if you need me sweetie . 
Economics T-shirt project ..... yup my life is that exciting :p 
My hand is screaming in pain but my Econ T-shirt is almost done . Now I have to decorate :) 
wants to sleep so badly right now . But at least Solo and Ensemble is over FOREVER :) 
doesn't care anymore . It's just not worth the effort or the stress . 
Keep on whispering in my ear , tell me all the things that I wanna hear , cause it's true , that's what I like about you ~ This song has been stuck in my head ALL DAY 
You know what ? I really just can't do this anymore . 
Hey guess what ! I decided I'm going to be in a good mood despite todays awfulness . I would rather be happy anyway :) 
feels accomplished . And all I did was get out of bed . I hate being sick :( 
feels 1000% better today . Just in time for school haha . 
has just had one of those days where you can't decide whether you should punch someone or just cry . Urgh . 
I love dance . Just saying :) 
was at the DMV for 3 HOURS and just saw what I got on the Mr. Rupp's stupid quiz . I hate my life . 
Today I got to go to recess for the first time since 6th grade ..... and I think a second grader may have a crush on me . I almost feel bad for him . Good day :) 
has the greatest parents EVER . Fantastic day out shopping . I even found short people pants ! I love you mom and dad . :) 
This has been the absolute best birthday ever . Thank you everyone for making my day so amazing :) 
is kind of sad that life-sized shamu toys are banned .... haha but the band trip will be lots of fun . 
should probably actually get ready for dance .... haha :) 
And just when I thought there couldn't possibly be something else that could happen this week ..... once again I am proved wrong . 
Thank you creeper :) ( you know who you are < PROPFEMALE > Paxton ) 
:) 
The way you walk , the way you talk , the way you say my name , it's beautiful , wonderful , don't you ever change :) 
This whole trade fair thing is not working out . I keep getting distracted from making the brochure ... haha 
is so glad Mr. Rupp thought it was necessary to give us 4 FRQs for homework and a quiz ... not . When will this class be over ? 
is very very excited . Prom :) 
AP Government and Literature down . Now I just have to survive Macroeconomics :) 
Happy Mother's Day to the best mom in the entire world , < PROPFEMALE > Kirkpatrick . I honestly don't know what I would do without you . I love you mommy . :) 
I keep telling myself only two more days ... and yet it doesn't make focusing on Econ any easier . 
wants to say happy birthday to the best little brother in the world < PROPFIRST > Kirkpatrick . :) 
I can't believe it's really over . If it wasn't for band banquet tonight I would be a mess right now . Thanks for all the good memories . 
It seems like only yesterday I was a freshman scared to death of all the upper classmen in band . And now I'm the one graduating . Seniors 2010 ! 
I'm kind of excited for dress rehearsal tonight .... :) Recital is Saturday ! 
Dance recital tonight :) 
Thank you to everyone who came to see me today . I love y'all so much and I'm so glad my last recital was one to remember :) 
I have never been so excited to get a phone call in my entire life :)

This has been the longest day of my life . And it's only seven .... 
A&M New Student Conference :) 
is finally home after a longgg few days . I'm excited for next year but seriously no more conference meetings please . 
Once again < PROPFIRST > Wong has changed my life . Oh my gosh . That was ridiculous . 
I just found out my roomie for next year :) AND I got my first choice on dorms . 
had a fantastic day with < PROPFEMALE > Paxton , my gorgeous twin . Now for a sleepover with < PROPFIRST > Chappell . :) 
Well Washington has been relatively uneventful so far ( except when we almost hit a deer ) but tomorrow we head out to Birch Bay for the family reunion .... oh boy . 
I love being only 100 feet from the ocean :) 
I miss everyone . Only two more days and I'm home . 
I am so glad I'm finally home . I've never been so tired in my life . 
I don't know how he always makes me smile and laugh , no matter how awful my day has been . 
< PROPFEMALE > , you were one of the strongest and most courageous people I have ever been lucky enough to know . I hope you know how much we love you . Rest in peace . 
Fish Camp 2010 was the most crazy experience of my life . I can't believe how many amazing people I met there . Camp Rabe and my Aggie family , I'll see you in about a week . 
True best friends are still going to be there for you , no matter how far away they are or how much time passes . The goodbyes just keep getting harder . 
had an absolutely fantastic night . I'm so lucky to have such an amazing boyfriend . 
really enjoyed stalking the band all day . I'm going to miss y'all . 
feels a little bit better about this whole college thing , thanks to < PROPFEMALE > Himes and my awesome roommate < PROPFEMALE > Hunt 
I was having a pretty good day until I found the flat tire on my car . I guess it's time to figure out where the car repair places are in College Station . 
Fixing my flat tire : Check . Now on to having lunch with DG Fluffy Bunnies . 
has definitely seen like three different groups of people almost get hit by a car in the last hour . College is dangerous . Haha 
I finally put up the pictures on my dorm wall . I kinda love it :) 
I have to print off 443 pages of reading for Philosophy . Oh my goodness :( 
Time to print off my Philosophy textbook . This should sufficiently take up my afternoon . :( 
First college class in 30 minutes . Here we go ..... 
is so lucky that she happened to wake up and look at the clock at 8:37 . Because the alarm for 8 AM definitely did not go off . 
Floor meeting in thirty minutes and a chapter of Biology to read . I feel kind of productive :) 
Midnight Yell was completely awesome . Now running errands with < PROPFEMALE > Himes and then watching the Aggies BTHO SFA ! :) 
doesn't have a car for the rest of the week . But on the bright side my parents are coming on Saturday to do something about it . This is going to be a long week . 
\I can't buy the aqua sandddd . < PROPFEMALE > buy it for me . \ " - < PROPFEMALE > Lanier ? watching an infomercial " 
just walked a mile in the pouring rain only to find out when I get to the dorm that apparently I was outside with a tornado . No big deal . 
Done with philosophy and a 40 minute power nap . Too bad Im never being let out of Chem lab an hour and half early ever again . 
< PROPFEMALE > Lanier ? is probably the coolest person i know , just saying . 
made the Aggies In Motion dance team ! :) 
First college lab report ? Complete . First college test ? Tomorrow . How high is my level of stress ? Ridiculously off the charts . 
hacking emilys fb b/c im not nice ;) 
Chemistry test , Biology class , and then I'm on my way to < PROPFIRST > ! :) 
Wednesday has to be the longest day of my life . 3 hour lab , 3 classes , homework , possibly dinner with Camp Rabe ( assuming the homework part doesn't take 3 hours ) and finally Aggies In Motion rehearsal . 
< PROPFEMALE > Hatton you just made my day . I love surprises :) 
hopes everyone is ok at UT . Stay safe please . 
There are 4 little fish in our fish tank . :) 
loves < PROPFEMALE > Paxton ridiculous amounts . She is the best twin ever :) 
I would watch the game but once again bio lab on Thursday night ruins all my plans . Oh well . Gig em Aggies ! 
[ I don't know what it is that makes me fall like this , The first time in your arms I knew , The way you held me , I knew that this could be what I've been waiting to find ] - Happy 6 months < PROPFIRST > Jenson :) 
Someone put up a hammock in the Century Tree .... and they're sleeping in it . Part of me wonders if the reason they are still there is everyone else is too afraid to be alone forever to go tell them to move . 
Lunch with the gorgeous < PROPFEMALE > Lanier ? , Chemistry , Biology , and then on my way to < PROPFIRST > :) 
just had one of the best weekends ever . It was so amazing to see everyone again :) 
\I swear it's happening . It's a mating epidemic . \ " - < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > " 
Lunch with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Wangler and my dad . This weekend has been so much fun . 
There's nothing I could say to you , nothing I could ever do to make you see what you mean to me . 
shared a life or death moment with < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > Wangler today . I never thought I would get to see a tornado touch down next to the highway ..... 
Philosophy class quote of the day : \Sometimes you just have to murder people . \ " - Dr. < PROPFIRST > " 
seriously needed that 2 hour nap . That was fantastic . 
I finally know what I want to do with my life . Today is a good day :) 
Some things really are worth fighting for . 
Sooo excited to spend the game with my best friend and my boyfriend . BTHO Texas Tech ! 
Today was absolutely amazing . I had a great time with < PROPFIRST > Jenson and my amazing friends . 
No one can even comprehend how angry I am that it was raining when I got out of class . I WASN'T WEARING MY RAIN BOOTS . :( 
You know you have the sweetest boyfriend ever when he texts you at 7:20 just to make sure you got up for your 8 AM chem lab . 
What a lovely day to BTHO OU :) 
\Is that pot ..... welcome to Cicis . \ " - < PROPFIRST > McGee \ 
Taking someone's phone who you don't even know is soooo funny . NOT . 
Im so excited to see my family and < PROPFIRST > Chappell tomorrow in Waco . And hopefully I will get to see < PROPFEMALE > Hatton and Jon-Michael Evans as well ! :) 
Today was absolutely amazing . I miss my family so much but luckily its only about 9 days until Thanksgiving Break ! 
Dear inconsiderate people in my dorm , \ 
What happened to laundry courtesy ? First , is it necessary to use 4 of the 5 available washers and not put a full load in any of them ? And second , I set a timer on my phone . I was down to take my clothes out only a minute after they finished and you already moved them and left them there so you could use the machine . Its called < PROPFEMALE > . Please learn some . \ 
Love , < PROPFEMALE > 
loves < PROPFEMALE > Hock and < PROPFEMALE > Krantz . My Christmas cookies are delicious . :) 
Sooo glad this week is finally over . Midnight Yell tonight , Maroon Out against Nebraska tomorrow , and then three more classes until I'm free ! :) 
BTHO Nebraska Aggies ! Let's show them the power of the 12th man . 
The chem lab final paper is sucking out my soul and my will to live . :( 
Just have to survive 9:35 Honors Philosophy and Im free . Longest class ever ? Most likely . 
can't wait to go on a date with < PROPFIRST > Jenson tonight and hopefully see the lovely < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > too :) 
Back in cstat just in time for class . Great .... 
\WHY are you staring deeply into my eyes while eating barbeque chips ??? \"- Jaycee Sleight " 
I honestly don't know what I would do without < PROPFIRST > Jenson . He always makes me laugh and smile no matter how terrible my day has been . Happy 8 months sweetheart :) 
\Think of the piece of music you hate the most from this class . After today you're going to be begging to listen to it after this . \ " Its gonna be a long class . " 
Why hello 1:30 AM . Im so glad chemistry has allowed us to meet again . 
\Well the band kids are all coming back with no clothes on .... \ " -my dad " 
Signing up for classes may have been the most stressful experience of my life . But on the bright side , I did get all the classes I needed . 
One hour and 30 minutes until I never have to glance at philosophy again . Let's do this . 
Chem 101 final at 10:30 , then studying biology and music until I actually pass out tonight .... is it Tuesday night yet ? 
Oh hello bio final . No amount of studying is going to make me feel ready for you . Awesome . 
Finals ? DONE ! Now eating at < PROPFEMALE > Garden and watching < PROPFEMALE > with Jaycee < PROPFEMALE > Sleight and < PROPFEMALE > Kutz 
Im so happy to be home . :) 
< PROPFEMALE > Currie . Cooliest person ever . 
< PROPFIRST > Jenson is the most awesomest person ever :)

Midnight Walmart run with < PROPFEMALE > Lanier and < PROPFIRST > Mcmath = Success :) 
My test schedule for this semester is terrible .... :( 
No chem lab this week AND my theatre history class doesn't have a final ? Today has turned into a pretty good day . 
Archery : the only kinesiology where I can show up in jeans and flip flops , not even hit the target , and still pass . I'm ok with this . 
had a fantastic time getting Spoons and TGI Fridays with < PROPFEMALE > Kutz , Jaycee < PROPFEMALE > Sleight , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , and < PROPFEMALE > Krudewig . 
loves her mom < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFIRST > Kirkpatrick . Talking to her always makes my day a little brighter :)

got to shoot for the first time in archery today . I'm officially in love :) 
\I'm not going to slap the screen ! That's emotional abuse . \"- < PROPFIRST > Jenson on skype " 
I think I might have a panic attack if chemistry gets cancelled tomorrow .... 
Yes , < PROPFEMALE > Hunt and I ran down four flights of stairs to take pictures in the snow at midnight . That's how we roll . :) 
And 4 hours later I have finished all of the chapter 14 OWL . It's been a productive afternoon . 
\Is that a burrito ? \"- Me\ 
THEY FIXED OUR SHOWER . \ 
I figured that deserved all capital letters . No one can understand the joy I'm feeling right now . :) 
Watching food network makes me wish that I had a kitchen . I want brownies .... 
For the first time in awhile I can honestly say I had an awesome day . I'm so excited for next year now that < PROPFEMALE > Himes and I signed our lease :) 
had a fantastic trip home this weekend . I am so lucky to have < PROPFIRST > Jenson in my life :) 
I love < PROPFEMALE > Himes for bringing < PROPFIRST>'s Day brownies to my dorm . 
Hot date with < PROPFEMALE > Lanier and our bio and chem labs . 
I'm so glad my brother < PROPFIRST > Kirkpatrick is ok . I love you and keep your head up . Everything will be ok . 
I hate WebAssign . 
Fun fact of the day : we only hear 1% of bats actual vocalization . Thank you bio 112 . 
Bio Lab Practical = OVER . Now I'm on to figuring out what in the world we learned in Chemistry . 
is ready for a relaxing evening with the lovely < PROPFEMALE > Hock and < PROPFEMALE > Krantz . 
< PROPMALE > bound ! 
This has officially been the most productive day of my life . I didn't know it was possible to do that much in 11 hours . 
Tomorrow for archery we get to bring something we hate to shoot at . Rules : It can't bleed and it has to be able to be pinned to the target . Any ideas ? 
I feel like my brain is going to explode from biology . 
I love < PROPFIRST > Chappell . She's my best friend . Thanks for the phone call love :) 
had an amazing birthday dinner thanks to < PROPFEMALE > Krudewig , < PROPFEMALE > < PROPMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > Kutz , and Jaycee < PROPFEMALE > Sleight . Not to mention a delicious cookie cake from the lovely < PROPFEMALE > Himes . Thank you everyone for the birthday wishes ! 
had a fantastic time at the aquarium with < PROPFIRST > and < PROPFIRST > :) 
I definitely don't want to leave for cstat . 
I am so completely lost on this chem lab . Help ? 
< PROPFEMALE > :) 
Calculus is killing me . Someone please help me ? :(

\I want to be just like Ke$ha when I grow up ! \"- Jaycee < PROPFEMALE > Sleight " 
Ready for The Big Event ! 
Me : Do you think that horses worry about unicorns like we worry about aliens ? \ 
Jaycee < PROPFEMALE > Sleight : You know the sad part is I actually deliberated that for a few seconds . 
One year ago , the most amazing guy I have ever met asked me to be his girlfriend . I am so glad I said yes and since then I've had one of the best years of my life . I love you < PROPFIRST > Jenson . Happy one year :) 
Lunch with the beautiful < PROPFEMALE > Luedecke .
