I called my dad recently . I'm not too glad to hear about his jaw situation . But I hope everything turns out good . I'll have to call him again soon and see how that turned out . I miss him a lot these days . It's been over 4 years since I've seen him . I do l 

I've always told myself where I got my good manners ; my mom . Just recently I figured she hardly uses them herself & is very rude towards me . So now I doubt where I got mine from . As long as I know mine are in tact , I'm in good shape . 
Went to ECW/WWE Superstars/Smackdown . Saw alot of entertaining wrestlers : Hurricane , Regal , CM Punk , < PROPMALE > & < PROPMALE > Hardy , < PROPFIRST > Morrison , Goldust , < PROPMALE > Mysterio , Kane , Chirstian , Big Show & Jericho , R-Truth , Legacy , Undertaker , and DX ! Everyone else I didn't care for . It was almost too good to be true with all these fun matches . It was the most fun I've had in a LONG , long while . 1st time I've seen a Steel Cage Match . 
I've been closer to the Lorti Family more so then usual with the camping trip then < PROPFEMALE>'s B-Day Party . I got to see their house finally . I'm making some cool projects in my Jewlery/Stained Glass classes in school . Just watched a good match between DX vs . Jerishow on Raw ; Guesthost \Big\ " < PROPMALE > Roethlisberger . Nothing too much different . " 
Got my 4 Wrestlemania 26 tickets yesterday . If you're going to Wrestlemania , give me a HELL YEAH !! 
is going to Wrestlemania 26 on March , 28th 2010 . Then to RAW on March 29th , 2010 . Need I say more on how I feel ? 
I guess .. hell froze over ? I'm in a relationship with someone I really like . That's good . That's more than good . It's past due , that's what that is . 18 Years past due . 
I just finished a 2 to 3 < PROPFEMALE > long message ( to < PROPFEMALE > ) . As I was finishing it up , I went to press backspace to delete an extra space but I accidentally bumped the tab key and then I pressed backspace . So it went to the previous < PROPFEMALE > and I lost my message ... 
Some guy that went to my school got killed recently . I didn't know him , but still depressing . Almost got beat up because I'm \alive\ " . And my relationship is put on hold for now . Or for good . ECW dies today also . Suckiest Tuesday EVER . " 
Went to Wrestlemania Axxess . Got a handshake from < PROPMALE > Finkel , < PROPMALE > , and < PROPFIRST > CENA . Also got a pre-signed Cena picture for having VIP tickets . Got to sit and take a picture in Undertaker's Ministry of Darkness Throne . Bought < PROPMALE > gear .

Going to see a movie with < PROPFEMALE > Today . Going to Red Mountain's Prom with her Tomorrow . Pretty much spent the week with her . 2010 is still busy being my year . 
I had the choice to go to school today on the last day . I did and NO ONE even bothered to say goodbye to me . I hugged Dany at the end of the day .. 
Spending the first night out of school , possibly forever , by myself . And no one said bye to me earlier in the day . That's how you know your unloved by the people you spend the most time with . 
I want to thank everyone who has been supportive of me as of late and dealing with these past couple of days . < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , < PROPFEMALE > , & < PROPFIRST > . I see myself as a living example of \Doing what's right is not always popular and doing what's popular is not always right\ " . The thing I know I'm doing right is just being myself to the fullest . " 
For the first time ever in almost 3 years , I actually had FUN at work . I know you go to work to work but when you have cool Managers & Team Leaders . Everyone just seems to get things done & everyone has a good time . We were also busy enough to keep us busy so it went by fast . 
Watched A-Team & Ironman 2 Yesterday . Plan on watching Get Him to The Greek , Karate Kid , Toy Story 3 , & possibly < PROPMALE > Hex next time I get a < PROPMALE > . 
A-Team & Ironman 2 last week . Toy Story 3 & < PROPMALE > Hex this week . Just bought Wrestlemania 26 on BluRay . 
Watched How to Train Your Dragon , The Killers , A-Team , Ironman 2 , Toy Story 3 & < PROPMALE > Hex in the past 3 weeks . Just bought Wrestlemania 26 on BluRay . 
Is trying to get prepared for the Zombies going to watch Vampires & Werewolves . I've survived the first two onslaughts . All I can do now is brace for impact & smile while getting paid . Dang you Twilight to hell , dang you indeed . 
Lesnar won . Apparently us WWE fans know something about < PROPMALE > that others don't . Watching him for over 2 years as appose to a few fights , gives us < PROPMALE > -fans the advantage of knowing how badly he is going to beat down his opponents ( or choke them out ) . Other than that , I've been getting some good hours in at work . Getting some good moolah & plenty O ' movie tickets . 
Well no wonder Lesnar had reason to win his fight against Carwin . The last two guys he met in the Squared Circle in his & Goldberg's last match ; < PROPMALE > Goldberg & < PROPMALE > < PROPFIRST > were in attendance at the fight . Along with The Rock & his former Manager , < PROPFIRST > Heyman , also some other wrestling buddies . Which included < PROPMALE > Batista . 
Watched Inception . Best movie in a LONG time ! The Trailers did the movie no justice . GO SEE INCEPTION . By the end of the movie you're just left amazed and in complete awe . It had emotion , action , suspense , and it worked your mind just the right amount . I give it a 5/5 < PROPFEMALE > Rating . 
Watched Inception again . It was still pretty good the second time around . There's only been 3 movies I've watched twice . This is the first one I've watched twice because I know it's an awesome movie . 
I go for the impossible knowing that everyone I know , think of my capabilities being low at the rate I'm going . The more they expect less from me , is more of a shock it'll be to them . 
My largest purchase yet has just arrived ; the new \it\ " factor I've been talking about . I'll reveal it on August 6th at my party ! " 
Just now replying to all my birthday comments on my wall . Thank You everyone who showed up for my party and to the people who wished me a happy birthday . 
I want to prove myself already . I just need that push . I need someone who can take me to the gym besides my mom . It's ridiculous bringing her . I can't reach my goals with her . But I still need someone's help , I can't do this alone . I either need a constant reminder of what keeps me going : Someone who's brought me down in the past or Someone I can imagine sharing my future with . This Passion inside me is BURNING !! 
What do you do when there is a person who can't see what their doing wrong , even though it's right in their face ? Their lying and they can't see that their doing it ? It really makes you wonder if your the one lying to yourself or if they both need you to show them the truth . In all honesty , things have been looking up for me . So I'm concerned for them . 
Happy Birthday to my little niece , < PROPFEMALE > , who turns 4 today ! :D It's so fun watching her grow up . Also , getting in another good workout today . Umm , going to see if I can get my plans finally set for Friday * cough*Jordon*cough * before Friday is here . 
70's vs . 80's day at school today . I chose the 90's . lol . Born in 91 ' after all . But to tickle my own sense of humor , I ate Oatmeal ( which supposedly was big in the 80's ) for breakfast and played Pacman ( which was made in 1980 ) on the internet ( < 
I feel like it's heaven on earth right now . Family , School , Friends , Girlz , My health . All issues at once , have cease to be issues . I know I'm doing something right . Thank You guys for all your support . Love you . I'm not really a religious man but I do want to Thank God for everthing he's gave me thus far . < PROPFEMALE > kiss ass too . So what I'm saying is I'm very grateful for what I have right now . 
This weekend didn't quite go to plan . Don't get me wrong , it wasn't bad . It just didn't get to where I wanted it to be . There's always next weekend ! Plus I got Raw to watch Tomorrow night . Gotta work out good this week at the gym to make up for this past weekend too . Wish me luck my peeps . 
Today : Woke up late for school , my day was dragging but it wasn't bad . Going to get my teeth cleaned at 3 . Than heading to the gym shortly after . Raw tonight . Let's hope the rest of the week picks up a bit , yah ? 
So I just added Formspring for the hell of it . Got any burning questions ? Feel free to ask . I'll answer as honestly as I can while answering as many questions as I possibly can . 
I'm gonna put this for my status for right now just because I'm running short on time but , uh , don'tcha love it when people post videos and you think to yourself \Wow that's not even funny ... even I could have done a better job \"?" 
So this goes out mostly to my friends , but if your family , your more than welcome to come : Anyone wanna go see Jackass 3D with me this weekend ( or Thursday night for the opening) ? Or what about SAW 3D when that comes out ? 
Worked out good twice at the gym Monday & Tuesday . My arms were hurting yesterday as I worked on my arms and today my \upper thigh region\ " hurts from working my legs . Not working out today though :( Nothing to do . Anyone wanna hangout or talk or .. something ? :) " 
Working Saturday & Sunday . I believe I'm watching a movie with my friend < PROPFEMALE > after work Sunday . And than back to school Monday . Blah . Atleast there's RAW on Monday Night . 
Got Friday Night SmackDown ! to watch tonight . Professional Wrestling is just my everything ! I get to escape for 2 hours while watching it . Other than that I'm open to < PROPFEMALE > out with anyone all today ! And I just found out my Awesome Mother just to me a new phone ! I'll be destributing that number out here shortly :D 
Stupid phone won't activate ! The phone needs service to activate , to get service , I need to activate it ! Why must I battle for every little thing I want ! * cries * lol . 
FINALLY The phone HAS been fixed ! Found out ( w/ the help of Mi Madre ) the peeps at i-wireless had to activate my phone from their place . I just want to state at this time : I'm sorry for yelling at you Mother :( And another note : Thank You for helping me out by getting the phone when I have a money crunch . Ask for the nums ! 
New Phone ! Ask for my number or give me yours please . Would love to hear from all yall :) 
I got a new cell phone ! I need < PROPFIRST > ! That includes family & friends ! :: Tengo < PROPFEMALE > nuevo teléfono celular ! Necesito los números ! Eso incluye a la familia y amigos!::J'ai reçu < PROPFEMALE > nouveau téléphone cellulaire ! J'ai besoin de chiffres ! Cela inclut la famille et < PROPMALE > amis ! 
This goes out 2 the people who see me as The Bad Guy . My moral choices have ALWAYS been good . Things that PI$$ me off are when people think of me in a way that I AM NOT . I always try 2 do what's right for friends , family , & everyone else . NEVER accuse me of lying , cheating , stealing , or treating people bad for no reason . I take that sh ! t VERY personally . I'll be man enough 2 admit 2 any mistakes I've made . 
Didn't go to school today so I could play my new game , Smackdown Vs . Raw 2011 , all today . That's the first time I've done that . I might have done it with last years game , I'm not sure . But it is Awesome ! 
Anyone wanna hangout tomorrow for Halloween ? It's a Sunday night , so I'm sure that would limit a lot of people already . But I'm pretty much up for anything . As much as to go to a party or just sit around and watch scary movies all day . I'm doing nothing , so if you find yourself in the same situation , hit me up . 
Sorry guys , I haven't been much in the mood for Facebookin ' lately . I'm ok , lately things have been less than .. \enjoyable\ " But I've been doing a good job of keeping myself in good spirits though . I would have to say I'm doing better than good . heh :) Keep in touch guys . Love ya . " 
I'm usually on top of things when it comes to navigating a website . Plus I wouldn't be considered dumb when using a computer . So is it possible to make a new photo album without adding pictures to it right away ? I just need to create one so I could move some pictures I already have posted into that new album ? 
Just bought my Tickets , through Ticketmasters.com, for MONDAY NIGHT RAW on < PROPFIRST > . 3rd ! Section 106 , Row 1 , Seats 7-6 ! That's the low , meaning right-right above the floor level , middle section on the corner view . I get the same general section each time and they're a perfect view . 
Today ; Box 4:30 PM to 10:00 PM(or 10:30 ) Tomorrow ; Concession 4:00 PM to 10:00 PM ( or 10:30 ) . 
Blarg . It's cold .. very cold ... in this house . Boring too . Nothing to say .. nor no one to < PROPFEMALE > out with .. 
Excited for this weekend , if it's a go , to < PROPFEMALE > out with my sister < PROPFEMALE > Benefield in my hometown of Tucson ! Probablly going to see my little sisters too . < PROPFEMALE > < PROPFEMALE > & < PROPFIRST > and my dad after some 6-7 years (?) since we've < PROPMALE > out . I wanna say a new Garrison just might come back this next Monday . 
Today I cashed in on my right doings . I won the Green & Gold Fridays contest at school after 3 1/2 years at the best possible second ; the second to last Friday before I graduate . I've got my title belt , I'm graduating , and I've got a week to prove myself worthy of redemption . And I can do it . HAHAHAH ! 
There is going 2B a Full Lunar Eclipse , Winter Solstice , & a Meteor shower tonight ; hasn't happened since 1638 . Any1 wanna come over tonight & watch it with me ? RAW Tonight , Smackdown Tue . & Fri ., Tribute to the Troops on Wed ., WWE Superstars on Thur . 
2011 New Years Resolution : Take What's Mine . 
I just found out I have about $235 worth of gift cards ranging from This Christmas from , I believe last years Christmas . Also , I have so many movie passes that they're at least a minimum of $168 ( during the day ) , and at a maximum of $228 worth ( at night ) . Technically I only have $100 in my bank accounts . 
Thank you < PROPFEMALE > Tonn , Zakie Gatorade , Brit Thompson , < PROPFIRST > Wills , < PROPFIRST > Wax , < PROPFEMALE > Burke , Layna Lawson , & < PROPMALE > Border for adding me recently . I'm glad I can keep in touch with you guys now . As some of you may know , I'm here whenever you guys need me . Either for advice , someone to hangout with , or just to talk each other's ears off with gibberish . Love ya guys . 
YES ! I'm going to the first < PROPFIRST > Cena-less RAW of 2011 this Monday ! He got a legitimate Hip injury during a live event . And hey , who wants to accompany me to this event , I have one free ticket and no body to take ! 
Ok guys I want you to do me a favor : I want you guys to say what makes me , Garrison , so Garrison-like . And what do you like about it . Be as honest as you can . Any helpful suggestions or concerns that might help me out , are appreciated :) Love ya guys . 
Ate breakfast , took a shower . Watching CharlesTrippy ( AKA Internet Killed Television ) on Youtube . Them I'm going to start cleaning & rearranging my room . I'm going to take some before-and-after shots . Anyone want to ( re)watch Social Network with me at the movies before this Friday ? My treat :) 
So out of 9 people I offered a free movie to , 7 people responded . 5 said Yes , they could make it . 4 later on changed their minds , and could not make it . The last 1 flat out didn't show up .. 
I think my goal for today is to message everyone or leave a comment on everyone's wall today . See what's up with people , check in , ya know ? That kinda thing . 
Lust , Greed , Slothfulness , Gluttony , Envy , Wrath , and Pride . I hold 5 of these 7 sins . How about you ? 
Why do you guys choose to ignore me ? I can tell when you do it . And it hurts . So please stop . 
I had another weird dream last night . I just don't really remember it .. I think it had the person I have liked for over years now in it . 
Since December , all I've been doing has been waking up just to go to sleep . Than work on the weekend . Anyone want to save me ? Please . 
Had a great day yesterday & < PROPMALE > out w/Stefany Fox & < PROPFEMALE > Cobb the night before , just ate at 5&Diner , went to < PROPFEMALE > s & started to watch a movie but had to leave . Got off work early in the morning . Watched The Dilemma , it was awesome . Walked to the mall in perfect weather . Got myself 6 free pairs of sunglasses ! And < PROPMALE > out with my bro as he played the Wii for the rest of the night . 
About to watch WWE Monday Night Raw ! Hopefully it's a good one . It seemed like this past week went by REALLY slow , must be all the room-time I spent . Anywho , people lets < PROPFEMALE > out this week , ok ? Love ya guys . 
As we approach the < PROPMALE > Rumble ( RR ) this Sun ., I want to take a look back at what was happening today exactly 2years ago . Man , have the years passed . I tried to hold a RR Party . No-1 I invited , except < PROPMALE > , showed up . The bright side ? He brought some-1 w/him . I met a Ms. Luciana Kimbrough 4-the 1st time . The next person ? They < PROPMALE > out w/me on the 31st of 2010 , lets see if she remembers who she is ! 
As humans , we need to use our darksides for good . 
Hey peeps ! I want you all to show up at my place Sunday evening so we can chill . Watch The < PROPMALE > Rumble , eat , and have fun ! 
Lets see how long it takes for \The Creep\ " to get huge . Lol . Them lonely island boys .. haha . " 
< PROPMALE > < PROPMALE > FREAKIN ' RIO WON THE RUMBLE !? Now he gets to headline Wrestlemania !? Eww :( Thanks for watching a good majority of the Rumble with me Rissa Sapien ! I appreciate it ! You're brother was pretty cool too , heh . 
Wow what an awesome day ! I messaged < PROPFEMALE > after so many years and now we finally got a back & fourth conversation going . I got off work early , I ate an awesome dinner . Watched the < PROPMALE > Rumble with Rissa Sapien & her brother . < PROPFEMALE > Fox & < PROPFEMALE > Cobb couldn't make it . But that's ok , I'm sure they'll make it up to me . 
So at the < PROPMALE > Rumble , we saw guest appearances by Diesel ( < PROPFIRST > Nash ) & < PROPMALE > T . And tonight on RAW , there was a promo for , who I'm guessing is , Sting . Rumor of Triple H & Taker coming back sometime around Wrestlemania . The < PROPMALE > Lesnar rumor hasn't died down . 
Hey I uploaded some 90 pictures , go take a look ! 
Watchin ' WWE Friday Night SmackDown . I work early tomorrow and Sunday . So lets hangout this week or next weekend ! 
< PROPMALE > T has officially decided to stay in the WWE as a Commentator for Smackdown ! < PROPFIRST > Nash , as Diesel , is officially returning too . And rumored returns of < PROPMALE > < PROPFEMALE > , Sting , Triple H , Taker ! No development of < PROPMALE > Lesnar vs Taker , we have about a month to find out . 
Dang ... Just wrote 2 messages , an hour long spent on each . Lol . 
Just woke up . Heading into work at 9 . Enjoy the SuperBowl everyone ! Hey let's hangout this week , ok ? 
I may or may not have just lied about not wasting money for this year . CUZ I BOUGHT ANOTHER TITLE BELT ! It was $150 instead of it's usual $200+ which isn't all that bad compared to my first one . So starting today , right now , I'm changing up my life . Wish me luck guys . It's gonna be a tough road next couple of months . 
There is some confusion that I need to clear up . If someone works at Taco < PROPFEMALE > , they get free ( or discounted ) Tacos . If I work at the movies , what do I get free ? The first few peeps to answer correctly get a movie pass ! We got 1 winner so far . 
Hmm . The winds of change are back .. 
Just wrote another hour-and-20Min message to someone lovely . Lol . Seriously people , ever need to talk to someone . Or you just need a Pen-Pal via Facebook . I'm your guy ! 
Anyone want to hangout Friday ? I work 9-5 Saturday . 9:15 to 5 Sunday . Then I'm off ALL WEEK long , if anyone wants to hangout then ? 
Covering Ms. Ashley Butts shift late Fri , also working early Sat & Sun . Hoping to hangout with Rissa Sapien today . And hanging out with Dexdur Kristean Dillander on Tuesday . 
Hey guys . I rearranged my pictures and just added a few so go check those out . Yes I am talking to YOU . lol . 
So I work early both Saturday & Sunday . Anyone want to hangout tomorrow ? I dunno why I bother to ask because none of you bother to answer this . I don't even have good faith that you read this .. 
STILL waiting for someone to teach me how to drive . This is absolutely ridiculous , you think family would be able to help you or friends for that matter . 
You sit there and you thump your bibles and you say your prayers and it didn't get you anywhere , talk about your psalms , talk about < PROPFIRST > 3:16 . < PROPFIRST > 3:16 says I just whipped your ass ! 
So I'm suppose to hangout with < PROPFEMALE > Voels & Dexdur Kristean Dillander at different times tomorrow . < PROPFEMALE > Cobb Wednesday . Maybe later on this week : Rissa Sapien , Brit Thompson . And < PROPFEMALE > McClain sometime before she leaves for CA . If we're gonna have a kickass time give me a HELL YEAH ! 
So this week hasn't been a complete bust . I did get < PROPFEMALE > Voels to teach me some parking . Along with my sister , < PROPFEMALE > . I did see 2 movies with Dexdur Kristean Dillander . I DID NOT hangout with < PROPFEMALE > Cobb , Rissa Sapien , Brit Thompson , or < PROPFEMALE > McClain like planned . 
Anybody want a friend ? I don't back stab , I don't lie , cheat , or steal . I'm not flaky . I'm there for people when they need it . I give good advice , I don't use people . I'm not into fitting the idea of what a good friend should be because I am the real deal . 
Snooki , along with < PROPFIRST > Morrison & [ The Return of ] < PROPFEMALE > Stratus , is gonna face Dolph Ziggler & the Team of Lay-Cool at Wrestlemania . And the night before , < PROPFIRST > < PROPFIRST > is being inducted into the WWE Hall Of Fame ! 
Who wants to see some [ FREE ] movies with me this week ? I'd pity da fool that says no ! 
I have twelve movie passes that are just sitting in my wallet & I'm getting four more on Friday too . If you want some , let me know . 
It sucks that I spent my first and only Prom with people I can't share a good memory with .. 
Hey Skyline folk , or anyone who goes to high school right now , two things : When is Skyline's Prom coming up ? Secondly , how much do I add to the Cap & Gown size when ordering ? 
Hey , who wants to go to WWE Friday Night SmackDown LIVE with me on June 28th ? I'm buying presale tickets around 12PM today . It'll be my treat ! Tell me if you wanna come . < PROPFEMALE > Thorson ? Rissa Sapien ? Anybody ? 
Okay , this is the third time I'll be asking you guys , since you like to ignore me . When ordering a Cap & Gown for graduation from Balfour , how much do you add to your height and weight ? A rep that always talk to Skyline says the SAME thing TWICE EVERY YEAR , so I need help remembering what he said . 
Work kinda late Friday & Early Saturday . Have my Graduation/WM PARTY ON SUNDAY PEOPLE ! I'm almost situated for my graduation . I just need invites , and trust me I'm going to send them to EVERY SINGLE PERSON who doesn't show up this sunday ... oh and senior pictures >=D 
This is how it goes . If you guys don't show up this sunday , excluding family , some of you will be up for deletion . Just tired of the \I'm your friend\ " business when there's no effort put forth . " 
Today is my party , the one I've been warning you about for the last two months , people who keep asking \What's today ? \"" 
I think I know what I'm going to save up for ... Wrestlemania 28 . The Rock vs . Cena , The Undertaker will probably have his last match either going 2 0-0 or 19-1 at Wrestlemania . As a fan , I can't miss that . Miami Gardens , Florida .. April 1st , 2012 . 
DAMN IT ! I spend all day playing Indigo Prophecy , not messing up once the entire game . Then I screw up at the LAST SECOND making the human race deal with an Ice Age ! AGHHH ! 
Alot of movies out the the past two weeks . Who wants to see them with meh ? 
Hey Skyline peeps , when is this year's prom ? I know it should be fairly close but I'm not sure when . 
Sad night it's going to be tonight .. Edge relinquishes the World Heavyweight Championship on WWE Friday Night SmackDown and retires . His dreams are shattered by being the ultimate thing he dreamed about , being a WWE \Rated-R\ " Superstar . " 
Happy Birthday to the April's Fools : < PROPFEMALE > Thorson ( 11th ) , Mr. Josh Burch ( 14th ) & < PROPFIRST > Callahan ( 14th ) , Mi Madre ( 15th ) , < PROPFEMALE > Lambert today ( 16th ) , < PROPFEMALE > Robinson ( 18th ) , and < PROPFIRST > Fortunato ( 28th ) :p 
Just keeping you updated . Still have no idea where my phone is , I'm 95% sure I lost it at Harkins . Text 4803096589 , and say there'll be a reward if returned . Thanks to those who ( have ) help(ed ) .
