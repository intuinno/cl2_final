We should keep private matters private ! This is a public space and if you don't want to hear what someone has to say then keep your private business where it belongs . 
It has been a very long day ! Had a job interview this morning then went to the hospital to sit with my sister while my brother-in-law had heart bypass surgery . What a day !!!! 
Had a wonderful time dancing the night away ! Better get to bed have to be up early for church . 
There is nothing like sitting in the porch swing with the cool morning breeze blowing on you and listening to nature all around you ! 
Had a wonderful weekend !!! The Single Adult Conference was my first and it was great ! Made new friends and gained new insight on many aspects of my life . I loved being with singles like me !!!
